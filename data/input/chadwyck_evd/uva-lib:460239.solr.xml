      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Convent in Perth. Angus, Dunbar. Dunbar. But that my Duty calls, I would decline Th'unwelcome Office.—Now, when Justice waves Her flaming Sword, and loudly claims her Due, Thus to arrest her Arm, and offer Terms Of Peace to Traitors who avow their Crime, Is to my Apprehension weak, and suits But little with the Majesty of Kings.— Why sleeps the wonted Valour of our Prince? Angus. Not to th'ensanguin'd Field of Death alone Is Valour limited: She sits serene In the delib'rate Council; sagely scans The Source of Action; weighs, prevents, provides, And scorns to count her Glories, from the Feats Of brutal Force alone,— —What Frenzy were it To risk our Fortune on th'unsure Event Of one Occurrence, naked as we are To unforeseen Disaster, when the Terms We proffer may retard th'impending Blow? —Better to conquer by Delay: The Rage Of Athol's fierce Adherents, flush'd with Hope Of Plunder and Revenge, will soon abate, And ev'ry Hour bring Succour to our Cause. Dunbar. Well ha'st thou taught me, how the piercing Eye Of calm Sagacity, excels the Dint Of headstrong Resolution.—Yet, my Soul Pants for a fair Occasion to revenge My Father's Wrongs on Athol's impious Head! Yes, Angus, while the Blood of March revolves Within my Veins, the Traitor shall not find His Perfidy forgot—But what of this? What are my private Injuries, compar'd To those he meditates against the State! Against a Prince with ev'ry Virtue grac'd That dignifies the Throne, to whom the Ties Of Kindred and Allegiance could not bind His faithless Heart: Not ev'n the sacred Bond Of Friendship unreserv'd!—For well thou know'st, The King securely list'ned to his Voice, As to an Oracle. Angus. 'Twas there indeed He triumph'd in his Guile!—Th'unwary Prince Sooth'd by his false Professions, crown'd his Guilt With boundless Confidence; and little thought That very Confidence supply'd his Foe With Means to shake his Throne!—While Athol led His royal Kinsman thro' the dang'rous Path Of sudden Reformation, and observ'd What Murmurs issu'd from the giddy Croud; Each popular Commotion he improv'd By secret Ministers; and disavow'd Those very Measures he himself devised! Thus cherish'd long by his flagitious Arts, Rebellion glow'd in secret, 'till at length His Scheme mature, and all our loyal Thanes At their own distant Homes repos'd secure, The Flame burst out.—Now from his native Hills, With his Accomplice Grime, and youthful Heir, Impet'ous Stuart, like a sounding Storm He rushes down with five revolting Clans; Displays a spurious Title to the Crown, Arraigns the Justice of his Monarch's Sway, And by this sudden Torrent, means, no doubt, To sweep him from the Throne. Dunbar. Aspiring Villain! A fit Associate has he chose: A Wretch Of Soul more savage breathes not vital Air, Than Grime:—But Stuart 'till of late, maintain'd A fairer Fame. Angus. A cherish'd Hope expires In his Dishonour too!—While Stuart's Ear Was deaf to vicious Counsel, and his Soul Remained unshaken, by th'enchanting Lure Which vain Ambition spread before his Eye, He bloom'd the Pride of Caledonia's Youth, In Virtue, Valour and external Grace:— For thou sole Rival of his Fame, wa'st train'd To martial Deeds, in Climes remote. Dunbar. O Thane! Whatever Wreaths from Danger's Steely Crest My Sword hath won; whatever Toils sustain'd Beneath the sultry Noon, and cold, damp Night; Could ne'er obtain for me one genial Smile Of Her, who bless'd that happy Rival's Vows With mutual Love!—Why should I dread to own The tender Throbbings of my captive Heart! The melting Passion which has long inspir'd My Breast for Eleonora, and implore A Parent's Sanction to support my Claim? Angus. Were she more fair and gentle than she is, And to my partial Eye, nought e'er appear'd So gently fair, I would approve thy Claim To her peculiar Smiles. Dunbar. Then will I strive With unremitted Ardour, to subdue Her coy Reluctance; while I scorn the Threats Of frantic Jealousy that flames unrein'd In Stuart's Breast!—But see! the fair one comes, In all the Pride of dazz'ling Charms array'd. SCENE II. Angus, Dunbar, Eleonora. Eleonora. Something of Moment, by a fresh Dispatch Imparted to the King, requires in Haste The Presence of my Sire. Angus. Forbear a while Thy Parly with the Foe; and here attend Our Consultation's Issue.— [Exit Angus. SCENE III. Dunbar, Eleonora. Dunbar. Ill it suits A Soldier's Tongue, to plead the Cause of Love, In Phrase adapted to the tender Theme: But trust me, beauteous Wonder! when I swear Not the keen Impulse, and impatient Hope Of Glory, glowing in the Warrior's Breast, With more awak'ned Transport, fill'd my Soul When the fierce Battle rag'd, than that I feel At thy Approach!—My Tongue has oft reveal'd The Dictates of my Heart; but thou, averse With cold Disdain, hast ever chill'd my Hopes, And scorn'd my proffer'd Vows!— Eleonora. O Youth, beware! Let not the flow'ry Scenes of Joy and Peace, That faithless Passion to the View presents, Ensnare thee into Woe!—Thou little know'st What Mischiefs lurk in each deceitful Charm; What Griefs attend on Love.— Dunbar. Keen are the Pangs Of hapless Love, and Passion unapprov'd: But where consenting Wishes meet, and Vows Reciprocally breath'd, confirm the Tie, Joy rolls on Joy, an inexhausted Stream! And Virtue crowns the sacred Scene with Peace! Eleonora. Illusion all! the Phantoms of a Mind That o'er its present Fate repining, Courts The vain Resource of Fancy's airy Dreams.— War is thy Province.—War be thy Pursuit.— Dunbar. O! thou would tell me, I am Savage all— Too much estrang'd to the soft Arts of Life, To warm thy Breast!—Yes, War has been my School— War's rough Sincerity, unskill'd in Modes Of peaceful Commerce—Soften'd not the less To pious Truth, Humanity and Love. Eleonora. Yes:—I were envious to refuse Applause, When ev'ry Mouth is open'd in thy Praise.— I were ungrateful not to yield thee more, Distinguish'd by thy Choice; and tho' my Heart Denies thee Love, thy Virtues have acquir'd Th'Esteem of Eleonora. Dunbar. O! thy Words Would fire the hoary Hermit's languid Soul With Extasies of Pride!—How then shall I, Elate with ev'ry vainer Hope, that warms Th'aspiring Thought of Youth, thy Praise sustain With Moderation?—Cruelly benign! Thou hast adorn'd the Victim; but, alas! Thou likewise giv'st the Blow!— Tho' Nature's Hand With so much Art has blended ev'ry Grace In thy enchanting Form, that ev'ry Eye With Transport views thee, and conveys unseen The soft Infection to the vanquish'd Soul, Yet wilt thou not the gentle Passion own, That vindicates thy Sway!— Eleonora. O gilded Curse! More fair than rosy Morn, when first she smiles O'er the dew-brighten'd Verdure of the Spring! But more deceitful, tyrannous, and fell, Than Syrens, Tempests, and devouring Flame! May I ne'er sicken, languish and despair Within thy dire Domain!—Listen ye Powers! And yield your Sanction to my purpos'd Vow— —If e'er my Breast— [Kneeling. Dunbar. For ever let me pine In secret Misery, divorc'd from Hope! But ah, forbear! nor forfeit thy own Peace Perhaps in one rash Moment— SCENE IV. Dunbar, Eleonora, Herald. Herald. —From the Tower That fronts the Hills, due North, a moving Host Is now descry'd: And from the southern Gate A Cloud of Dust is seen to roll, the Gleam Of burnish'd Arms, oft thro' the dusky Sphere Salutes the dazzled Eye;—a loyal Band With valiant Ramsay, from the Banks of Tweed, That hastens to our Aid.—The first, suppos'd The rebel Train of Athol.—By Command Of Angus, I attend thee, to demand An Audience of the Foe. Dunbar. I follow straight. [Exit Herald. Whate'er is amiably fair—Whate'er Inspires the gen'rous Aim of chaste Desire, My Soul contemplates and adores in thee! Yet will I not with vain Complainings, vex Thy gentle Nature.—My unblemish'd Love Shall plead in my Behalf. [Exit Dunbar. SCENE V. Eleonora. Adieu brave Youth! Why art thou doom'd to suffer fruitless Pains! And why, alas! am I the destin'd Wretch That must inflict them?—Agonizing Thought! I yielded up my fond, believing Heart To him who basely left it, for the Charms Of treacherous Ambition!—hapless Stuart! How art thou chang'd! how lost! thy cruel Fate, Like a false Harlot, smiles thee into Ruin! SCENE VI. Enter Stuart disguised like a Priest. Stuart, Eleonora, Stuart. The mighty Schemes of Empire, soar too high For your Distinction, Daughter.—Simple Woman Is weak in Intellect, as well as Frame, And judges often from the partial Voice That sooths her Wishes most. [Discovering himself. Eleonora. Ha, frantic Youth! What guilty Purpose leads thy daring Steps To this forbidden Place?—Art thou not come Beneath that sacred Veil, the more to brave Th'avenging Hand of Heav'n? Stuart. No—that I tread The Paths of Danger, where each Bosom pants With keen Revenge against me, speaks aloud The Fervour of my Love—My Love misplac'd! Else, would'st thou not receive the gen'rous Proof With Anger and Disdain.— Eleonora. Have I not Cause To drive thee from my Heart?—Hast thou not chac'd All Faith, and Truth, and Loyalty from thine? Say, hast thou not conspir'd against thy Prince? A Prince! who cherish'd thee with parent Zeal, With Friendship honour'd thee, and ev'ry Day With bounteous Favour crown'd thy rising Wish! Stuart. Curse on his Arts!—his Aim was to enslave Th'aspiring Soul, to stifle and repress Th'emerging Dictates of my native Right, To efface the glowing Images within, Awak'd by Glory, and retain by Fraud The Sceptre he usurps! Eleonora. Insidious Charge! As feeble as unjust! for, clear as Day In Course direct— Stuart. In idle Argument Let us not now consume the precious Hour; The middle Stream is pass'd; and the safe Shore Invites our dauntless Footsteps—Yonder Sun That climbs the Noon-tide Arch, already sees Twelve thousand Vassals, marching in the Train Of warlike Athol; and before the Shades Of Ev'ning deepen, Perth's devoted Walls Will shake before them—E'er the Tempest roars, I come to snatch thee from th'impending Storm— Eleonora. O impotent of Thought!—O! dead to Shame! Shall I for pompous Infamy forego Th'internal Peace that Virtue calls her own! Stuart. Or, say, thy Love inconstant as the Wave, Another Object claims.—False—perjur'd Maid! I mark'd thy Minion, as he charm'd thine Ear With grov'ling Adulation.—Yes, I saw Thy Looks, in artful Languishment, disclose Thy yielding Soul, and heard thy Tongue proclaim The Praises of Dunbar.— Eleonora. Away—away! I scorn thy mean Suspicion, and renounce Thy Passion with thy Crimes.—Tho' bred in Camps, Dunbar is gentle, gen'rous and humane; Possess'd of ev'ry manly Grace, to win The coyest Virgin's Heart.— Stuart. Perdition whelm The prostrate Sycophant!—may Heav'n exhaust Its Thunder on my Head—may Hell disgorge Infernal Plagues to blast me, if I cease To persecute the Caitif, 'till his Blood Assuage my parch'd, Revenge!—perfidious Slave! To steal between me and my darling Hope!— The Traitor durst not, had I been—O Vows! Where is your Obligation?—Eleonora! O lovely Curse! restore me to myself!— Eleonora. Rage on fierce Youth, more savage than the Storm That howls on Thule's Shore!—th'unthrifty Maid Too credulously fond! who gave away Her Heart so lavishly, deserves to wed The Woes that from her Indiscretion flow!— —Yet ev'n my Folly should, with thee, obtain A fairer Title and a kinder Fate!— Stuart. Ha! weep'st thou?—witness all ye sacred Pow'rs! Her Philtres have undone me!—lo, my Wrath Subsides again to Love!—Enchantress! say, Why hast thou robb'd me of my Reason thus? Eleonora. Has Eleonora robb'd thee!—O recal Those flatt'ring Arts thy own Deceit employ'd To wreck my Peace!—recal thy fervent Vows Of constant Faith—thy Sighs and ardent Looks! Then whisper to thy Soul, those Vows were false— Those Sighs unfaithful, and those Looks disguis'd! Stuart. Thou—thou art chang'd—but Stuart still the same! Ev'n while thou chid'st me, ev'ry tender Wish Awakes anew, and in my glowing Breast Unutterable Fondness pants again!— —Wilt thou not smile again, as when, reclin'd By Tay's smooth-gliding Stream, we softly breath'd Our mutual Passion to the vernal Breeze? Eleonora. Adieu—dear Scenes adieu!—ye fragrant Paths So courted once!—ye spreading Boughs, that wave Your Blossoms o'er the Stream!—delightful Shades! Where the bewitching Music of thy Tongue, First charm'd my captive Soul!—when gentle Love Inspir'd the soothing Tale!—Love—sacred Love That lighted up his Flame at Virtue's Lamp!— Stuart. In Time's eternal Round, shall we not hail Another Season equally serene?— —To Day, in Snow array'd, stern Winter rules The ravag'd Plain—Anon the teeming Earth Unlocks her Stores, and Spring adorns the Year: And shall not we—while Fate, like Winter, frowns, Expect revolving Bliss? Eleonora. —Would'st thou return To Loyalty and me—my faithful Heart Would welcome thee again!— Angus Within. Guard ev'ry Gate That none may 'scape— Eleonora. Ha!—whither wilt thou fly? Discover'd and beset? Stuart. Let Angus come— His short-liv'd Pow'r I scorn— [Throws away his Disguise. SCENE VII. Enter Angus with Guards, Stuart, Eleonora. Angus. What dark Resolve By gloomy Athol plann'd, has hither led Thy Steps presumptuous?—Eleonora, hence.— It ill befits thee—but, no more—away— I'll brook no Answer— [Exit Eleonora. —Is it not enough, To lift Rebellion's impious Brand on high, And scorch the Face of Faith; that ye thus creep In ruffian Ambush, seeking to perform The Deed ye dare not trust to open War? Stuart. Thou little know'st me—or thy rankling Hate Defrauds my Courage.—Wherefore should I skulk Like the dishonour'd Wretch, whose hireling Steel In secret lifted, reeks with human Gore, When valiant Athol hastens at the Head Of warlike Thousands, to assert our Cause? Angus. The Cause of Treason never was confin'd To Deeds of open War; but still adopts The Stab of crouching Murder.—Thy Revolt, The stern Contraction of thy sullen Brow, And this Disguise, Apostate! speak thee bent On fatal Errand.— Stuart. That thou seest me here Unarm'd, alone, from Angus might obtain A fair Interpretation—Stuart's Love Pleads not in mystic Terms; nor are my Vows To Eleonora, cancell'd or unknown— Vows by thyself indulg'd, e'er Envy yet, Or Folly had induc'd thee, to embrace The Fortunes of our Foe.—Thy foul Reproach My Soul retorts on thee! and mark, proud Lord, Revenge will have its Turn!— Angus. Ha! must I bear A beardless Traitor's Insults?—'tis not mine To wage a fruitless War of Words with thee, Vain-glorious Stripling.—While thine Aims were just, I seal'd thy Title to my Daughter's Love; But now, begrim'd with Treason, as thou art, By Heav'n! not Diadems and Thrones shall bribe My Approbation!—but the King himself Shall judge thy Conduct.—Guards— SCENE VIII. Enter Eleonora, who kneels. —O! let me thus Implore Compassion, at a Parent's Knees, Who ne'r refus'd.— Angus. —Convey him hence.— [Stuart is led off. —Arise— Remember, Eleonora, from what Source Thine Origin is drawn.—Thy Mother's Soul In Purity excell'd the snowy Fleece That cloaths our northern Hills!—her youthful Charms, Her artless Blush, her Look severely sweet, Her Dignity of Mien and Smiles of Love Survive in thee—Let me behold thee too Her Honour's Heiress— [Exit Angus. SCENE IX. Eleonora. —Yes—I will adhere To this ill-omen'd Honour! sacrifice Life's promis'd Joys to its austere Decree; And vindicate the Glories of my Race, At the sad Price of Peace!—If Athol's Arms (Which Heav'n avert!) to Treason add Success; My Father's Death will join his Sov'reign's Fall! And if the Cause of Royalty prevail, Each languid Hope with Stuart must expire!— From Thought to Thought, perplex'd, in vain I stray, To pining Anguish doom'd, and fell Dismay!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. [SCENE I.] SCENE Continues. Angus, Dunbar. Dunbar. By Heav'n it glads me, that my Sword shall find An ample Field to Day.—The King arrous'd, Chafes like a Lion in the Toils betray'd? Angus. I mark'd his Indignation, as it rose At Athol's proud Reply, from calm Concern, To anxious Tumult, menacing Disdain, And overboiling Wrath.—But say, my Friend, How move the Rebels?—Are their Ranks dispos'd By military Skill?—Or come they on In undistinguish'd Crouds?— Dunbar. In Concourse rude They swarm undisciplin'd—all arm'd alike With Sword and Target.—On their first Assault (Fearless indeed and headlong!) all their Hopes Of Conquest, must depend.—If we, unbroke, Sustain their Onset; little skill'd in War, To wheel, to rally and renew the Charge, Confusion, Havock and Dismay will seize Th'astonish'd Rout.— Angus. What Numbers bring they on? Dunbar. Ten thousand, as I guess.— Angus. Ours scarce amount To half the Number: Yet, with those, we mean, To hazard an Encounter.—Thou, mean while, Shalt visit ev'ry Passage, sound th'Alarm, And man the City-Walls.—Here I attend The King—and lo! he comes.— [Exit Dunbar. SCENE II. King, Angus. King. —The Commonweal Has been consulted.—Tenderness and Zeal Became the Parent.—Those have nought avail'd.— Now, let Correction speak the King incens'd! Angus. Not without Cause, my Liege, shall dread Rebuke Attend your royal Wrath.—What Reign shall 'scape Rebellion's Curse, when your paternal Sway Has hatch'd the baneful Pest? King. Let Heaven decide Between me and my Foes.—That I would spare The guiltless Blood which must our Quarrel dye, No other Proof requires, than my Advance To Reconcilement—opposite perhaps To my own Dignity.—But I will rise In Vengeance mighty! and dispel the Clouds That have bedimm'd my State. Angus. The Odds are great Between the Numbers: But our Cause is just: Our Soldiers regularly train'd to War, And not a Breast among us, entertains A Doubt of Victory. King. O valiant Thane! Experienc'd oft, and ever trusty found! Thy penetrating Eye, and active Zeal First brought this foul Conspiracy to Light; And now thy faithful Vassals, first appear In Arms for my Defence!—Thy Recompence My Love shall Study. Angus. Blotted be my Name From Honour's Records, when I stand aloof, Regardless of the Danger that surrounds The Fortunes of my Prince! King. I know thee well.— Mean time, our Care must be, to obviate With Circumspection and preventive Skill, Their Numbers.—In unequal Conflict joins Th'unwieldy Spear that loads the Borderer, With the broad Targe and expeditious Sword: The loyal Band that from the Hills of Lorn Arriv'd, shall in our Front advance, and stand With Targe to Targe, and Blade to Blade oppos'd; The Spears extended form the second Line, And our light Archers hover to and fro, To gall their Flanks.—Whatever Accident In Battle shall befal, thy Vigilance Will remedy.—Myself will here remain To guard the Town, and with a small Reserve, (If Need requires) thine Exigence supply. Angus. With Joy, the glorious Task I undertake! [Exeunt. SCENE III. Dunbar, Ramsay. Ramsay. They halt, and occupy the narrow Pass Form'd by the River and th'impending Hill; With Purpose (as I deem) to charge our Host On the small Plain that skirts the Town.— Dunbar. 'Tis well.— Thus hemm'd, their useless Numbers will involve Themselves in Tumult, to our Arms secure An easy Conquest, and retard their Flight.— To Angus hie thee straight with this Advice.— My Task perform'd, I wait the King's Command In this appointed Place.— [Exit Ramsay. SCENE IV. Eleonora, Dunbar. Eleonora. I sought thee, Youth.— Ere yet this dreadful Crisis shall decide The public Fate, let us to private Woe Devote one Moment!—Tell me, brave Dunbar, Wilt thou not, from the Hurry of the Day, One Moment snatch to hear me, and condole The Anguish of my Soul?— Dunbar. O Eleonora! Sooner shall the parch'd Traveller refuse The gelid Fountain, than my raptur'd Soul The Music of thy Tongue!—What Grief profanes Thy spotless Bosom?—happy! far above The Pride of Conquerors, were I to ease Thy Sorrow's Pangs!— Eleonora. Thy gen'rous Heart alone Can brook the Enterprize— Dunbar. O! task my Love; That I more swift than Gales that sweep the Plain, May fly to thy Relief! Eleonora. Then summon up Those elevated Thoughts, that lift the Soul To Virtue's highest Pinnacle; the Boon My Misery demands, will crave them all!— Dunbar. Be it to brave the Menaces of Death In Shape however horrid, so my Faith And Love remain inviolate, my Heart Beats with unusual Ardor; and demands The Test, impatient!— Eleonora. Friendless and forlorn, In Fetters Stuart lies!— Dunbar. Ha! Eleonora. From the Snares Of gloomy Fate release him.— Dunbar. Cruel Maid!— Nay, let me call thee barbarous! in spite Of Adoration.—Could thy Mind suggest No forward Slave, to set thy Lover free, But a despairing Rival?—'Tis not giv'n Th'impassion'd Soul of Man, to execute A Deed so fatal to its own Repose! Eleonora. I sought not—witness ye celestial Powers! To aggravate thy Pain—my Mind, perplex'd, Revolv'd in silent Woe, nor could unload Her Burden to another.—Thou alone, Hast won my fair Opinion and my Trust; And to thy Word indebted, Honour claims Th'Engagement all her own.— Dunbar. Yet, with Reserve Was that impawn'd: My Loyalty and Love Were sacred ev'n from that: Nor can I loose His Chains, without an Injury to Both!— Eleonora. Cold—unaspiring is the Love that dwells With tim'rous Caution; and the Breast untouch'd By Glory's Godlike Fervour, that retains The Scruples of Discretion.—Let the Winds That have dispers'd thy Promise, snatch thy Vows!— Dunbar. Shall I, thro' rash Enthusiasm, wed Eternal Anguish?—Shall I burst asunder The Bonds of awful Justice, to preserve The Serpent that has poison'd all my Peace!— No, Eleonora!—blasted be— Eleonora. Take heed! Nor by an Oath precipitate, involve Thy Fate beyond Resource: For know, Dunbar, The Love of Stuart, with his Guilt abjur'd, This Morn, my solemn Vow to Heav'n appeal'd, Hath sever'd us for ever.— Dunbar. Then, I'm still!— Still as the gentle Calm, when the hush'd Wave No longer foams before the rapid Storm!— Let the young Traitor perish, and his Name In dark Oblivion rot.— Eleonora. Shall I, alas! Supinely savage, from my Ears exclude The Cries of youthful Woe?—of Woe intail'd By me too!—If my Heart denies him Love, My Pity, sure, may flow!—Has he not Griefs That wake ev'n thy Compassion?—Say, Dunbar, Unmov'd could'st thou survey th'unhappy Youth (Whom but this Morn beheld in Pride of Hope And Pow'r magnificent!) stretch'd on the Ground Of a damp Dungeon, groaning with Despair! With not one Friend his Sorrows to divide, And chear his lone Distress?— Dunbar. Can I resist So fair a Motive, and so sweet a Tongue! When thy soft Heart with kind Compassion glows, Shall I the tender Sentiment repress?— No!—let me rather hail the social Pang; And ev'ry selfish Appetite subdu'd, Indulge a Flame so gen'rous and humane!— —Away with each Emotion that suggests A Rival favour'd and a Traitor freed! My Love unbounded reigns, and scorns to own Reflection's narrow Limits!—Yes, my Fair, This Hour he shall be free.— [Exit Dunbar. SCENE V. Eleonora. O wond'rous Power Of Love beneficent!—O gen'rous Youth! What Recompence (thus bankrupt as I am!) Shall speak my grateful Soul!—A poor Return Cold Friendship renders to the fervid Hope Of fond Desire! and my invidious Fate Allows no more.—But let me not bewail, With Avarice of Grief, my private Woe; When pale with Fear, and harrass'd with Alarm, My royal Mistress, still benign to me, The zealous Tender of my Duty claims. [Exit. SCENE VI. Discovers Stuart in Chains. Stuart. Curse on my headstrong Passion!—I have earn'd The Wages of my Folly!—Is it thus My faithless Destiny requites my Hope! SCENE VII. Stuart, Dunbar. Stuart. Ha! com'st thou to insult my Chains?—'Twas well My unpropitious Dæmon gave me up To your Resentment, tamely.— Dunbar. To exult Ev'n o'er an Enemy oppress'd, and heap Affliction on th'afflicted, is the Mark And the mean Triumph of a dastard Soul.— 'Tis what Dunbar disdains.—Perhaps, I come To pity, not rejoice at Stuart's Fate.— Stuart. To pity!—Torture! am I fall'n so low!— Ha! Recreant!—move thy Pity!—Hell untie These slavish Manacles, that I may scourge This wretched Arrogant!— Dunbar. True Courage scorns To vent her Prowess in a Storm of Words: And to the Valiant, Actions speak alone:— Then let my Deeds approve me.—I am come To give thee instant Freedom.— Stuart. Mean'st thou Death?— I shall be free then.—An apt Minister Th'Usurper has ordain'd to perpetrate His secret Murders.— Dunbar. Why wilt thou belye Thy own Intelligence?—Thou know'st, my Sword Was ne'er accustom'd to the Bravo's Stab; Nor the Designs of Him so falsely stil'd Usurper, ever sully'd with a Stain Of Cruelty or Guile.—My Purpose is, To knock thy Fetters off, conduct thee safe Without the City-Confines, and restore thee To Liberty and Athol.— Stuart. Fawning Coward! Thou—thou restore me!—thou unbind my Chains! Impossible!—Thy Fears that I may 'scape, Like Vultures gnaw thee!— Dunbar. When the Battle joins, Thou shalt be answer'd.— Stuart. When the Battle joins!— —Away, Dissembler!—Sooner would'st thou beard The Lion in his Rage, than fairly meet My Valour on the Plain! Dunbar. Ha! who art thou, That I should dread thy Threats?—By Heav'ns high Throne! I'll meet thee in a Desart, to thy Teeth Proclaim thy Treachery, and with my Sword Explore thy faithless Heart!—Meanwhile, my Steps Shall guide thee to the Field. [Stuart is unchained, and presented with a Sword. Stuart. No!—Lightning blast me, If I become thy Debtor, proud Dunbar! Thy nauseous Benefits, shall not enslave My freeborn Will.—Here, Captive as I am, Thy lavish'd Obligation shall not buy My Friendship!—No! nor stifle my Revenge! Dunbar. Alike unpleasant would it be to me, To court thy Love or deprecate thy Hate:— What I have proffer'd, other Motives urg'd.— The Gift is Eleonora's.— Stuart. Sacred Powers! Let me not understand thee!—Thou hast rous'd My Soul's full Fury!—In the Blood that warms Thine Heart, Perfidious, I will slake mine Ire! Dunbar. In all my Conduct, insolent of Heart! What hast thou mark'd so abject and so mean, Thy thy foul Tongue its Licence thus avows? To boundless Passion subject, as thyself, Wild Tumult oft my Reason overwhelms!— Then tempt me not too far, lest blindfold Wrath Transport my Soul, and headlong Ruin, crush Thy Pride ev'n here!— Stuart. In this accursed Place Let me be shackled—rivetted with Bolts, 'Till the Rust gnaw my Carcase to the Bone, If my Heart throbs not for the Combat, here!— Ev'n here, where thou art, Lord!—Ha! do'st thou shake? By Heav'n, thy quiv'ring Lip and haggard Look Confess pale Terror and Amaze!— Dunbar. —Away!— Away, lewd Railer!—not thy sland'rous Throat So fruitful of Invectives, shall provoke me To wreak unworthy Vengeance on thee, safe In thy Captivity:—But soon as War Shall close th'encountring Hosts, I'll find thee out— Assert my Claim to Eleonora's Love, And tell thee, what thou art. Stuart. I burn—I rage! My fell Revenge consumes me!—But no more— Thou shalt not 'scape me—Goaded by my Wrongs, I'll hunt thee thro' the various Scenes of Death!— Thou shalt be found!— Dunbar. I triumph in that Hope. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. Changes. King, Queen, attended. King. Couragious Angus shall not be o'erpower'd— Myself will bring him Aid.— Queen. Alas! my Prince! King. What means the gentle Part'ner of my Heart? Dismiss thy Fears.—This Day will dissipate The Cause of thy Dismay.—Ev'n now, I go To pluck the Wreath of Victory, and lay Fresh Laurels in thy Lap. Queen. Ah! why let in A Train of harpy Sorrows to my Breast!— —Ah! why in your own precious Life, expose Your Kingdom's Safety, and your Consort's Peace! —Let me restrain you from the Field to Day.— There is no Fame—no Glory to be won From a Revolter's Brow.— King. The Public-weal Commands to arm—Dishonour taint my Name, When I reject the Call!— Queen. Ill-omen'd Call! That like the Raven's Croak, invades my Quiet! O! would to Heaven, our Minutes smoothly roll'd In humble Solitude, with meek-ey'd Peace! Remote from Royalty, and all the Cares That brood around the Throne!— King. No, let us scorn Unfeeling Ease, and private Bliss forego, When public Misery implores our Aid.— What Dignity of Transport feels the Prince, Who, from the Fangs of fierce oppressive Power, A People rescues? Queen. What a dreadful Host Of Dangers 'circle him! King. Disease confers The Stamp of Value upon Health; and Glory Is the fair Child of Peril.—Thou thyself My Conduct wilt applaud, soon as thy Mind Its native Calm regains, and Reason sways Uncheck'd by Fear.—Secure 'till my Return Remain within, and ev'ry Thought indulge Foreboding my Success.— Queen. Adieu—Adieu! Heav'n crown your Valour with a happy Wreath. [Exit Queen. King , to an Attendant. Swift, hie thee to Dunbar, and bid him lead The chosen Citizens— Enter Ramsay. SCENE IX. King attended, Ramsay. Ramsay. O fatal Chance! The Traitor Grime, with a selected Band, (While Angus, press'd on every Side, sustains Th'unequal Fight) a secret Path pursu'd Around the Hills, and pouring all at once, Surpriz'd the eastern Gate!—the Citizens With Consternation smote, before his Arms In Rout disorder'd fly!— King. Ha! then the Wheel Of Fate full Circle rolls to crush me down! Nor leaves one Pause for Conduct!—Yet I'll bear My Fortunes like a King—Haste and collect The scattered Parties—Let us not submit 'Ere yet subdu'd—To Arms. [Drawing. Ramsay. Alas my Prince! The Convent is beset—Hark! while we speak The Gates are burst—Behold— King. We must prevent The Pangs of ling'ring Misery, and fall With Honour, as we lived— SCENE X. King attended, Ramsay. Grime with Followers bursting in. King. What bold Contempt Of Majesty, thus rudely dares intrude Into my private Scenes? Grime. The Hour is fled, That saw thy wanton Tyranny impose The galling Yoke—Yes, I am come to wrest The prostituted Sceptre from thy Hand, And drag thee fetter'd to the royal Throne Of Walter, whom I serve. King. Outragious Wretch! Grown old in Treachery! whose Soul untam'd, No Mercy softens, and no Laws restrain! Thy Life thrice forfeited, my Pity thrice From Justice hath redeem'd; yet art thou found Still turbulent—a rugged Rebel still, Unaw'd, and unreclaim'd!— Grime. That I yet breathe This ambient Air, and tread this Earth at will, Not to thy Mercy but thy Dread I owe.— Wrong'd as I was—my old Possessions reft By thy rapacious Power, my Limbs enchain'd Within a loathsom Dungeon, and my Name Thy loud Reproach thro' all the groaning Land; Thou durst not shed my Blood!—the purple Stream Had swell'd—a Tide of Vengeance! and o'erwhelm'd The proud Oppressor.— King. Traitor to thy Prince, And Foe perverse to Truth!—how full thy Crimes, Thy Doom how just—my Pardon how humane, Thy conscious Malice knows—But let me not Degrade my Name, and vindicate to thee The Justice of my Reign. Grime. Vain were th'Attempt With Artifice of Words, to sooth my Rage, More deaf to Mercy, than the famish'd Wolf That tears the bleating Kid!—My starv'd Revenge Thy Blood alone can satiate!—Yield thee then: Or sink beneath mine Arm. King. Heav'n shall not see A Deed so abject vilify my Name— While yet I wield this Sword, and the warm Blood Still streams within my Veins; my Courage soars Superior to a Ruffian's Threats.— Grime. Fall on, And hew them Piece-meal. [King, Ramsay, and Attendants drive off Grime and his Followers; but are afterwards overpowered and disarmed. Grime. Wilt thou yet maintain Thy Dignity of Words?—Where are thy Slaves, Thy Subjects, Guards and Thunder of thy Throne, Reduc'd Usurper?—Guard these Captives hence. [Exeunt King, Ramsay, &amp;c. guarded. SCENE XI. Enter a Soldier to Grime. Soldier. A Troop of Horsemen have possessed the Gate By which we gain'd the City.— Grime. Blast them Hell! We must retreat another Way, and leave Our Aim unfinish'd!—Our victorious Swords At least shall guard the Treasure they have won. When the fierce Parent-Lion bites our Chain, His Whelps forlorn, an easy Prey remain. END of the Second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. SCENE I. Queen, Eleonora, Captain. Queen. What from the Battlements hast thou descry'd? Captain. Nothing distinct, my Queen—Involv'd in Clouds Impervious to the View, the Battle long Continu'd doubtful, 'midst the mingling Sounds Of Trumpets, neighing Steeds, tumultuous Shouts Of fierce Assailants, doleful Cries of Death, And clatt'ring Armour; 'till at length, the Noise In distant Murmurs dy'd.—O'er all the Plain, Now a dread Stillness reigns! Queen. Then all is lost!— Why pauses Ruin, and suspends the Stroke!— Is it to lengthen out Affliction's Term, And feed productive Woe!—Where shall the Groans Of Innocence deserted find Redress! Shall I exclaim to Heav'n?—Already Heav'n Its Pity and Protection has withdrawn! Earth yield me Refuge then!—give me to lie Within thy chearless Bosom!—there, put off Th'uneasy Robe of Being—there, lay down The Load of my Distress! Eleonora. Alas! my Queen, What Consolation can the Wretched bring! How shall I from my own Despair, collect Asswasive Balm?—Within my lonely Breast Mute Sorrow and Despondence long have dwelt! And while my Sire, perhaps, this Instant, bleeds, The dim, exhausted Fountains of my Grief, Can scarce afford a Tear! Queen. O Luxury Of mutual Ill!—Let us enjoy the Feast! To Groan re-echo Groan, in concert raise Our Lamentation; and when Sorrow swells Too big for Utterance, the silent Streams Shall flow in common!—When the silent Streams Forbear to flow, the Voice again shall wail! O my lost Lord!—O save him—save him Powers! Eleonora. Is there no gentle Remedy, to sooth The Soul's Disorder; lull the jarring Thoughts, And with fair Images amuse the Mind? —Come smiling Hope—divine Illusion! come In all thy Pride of Triumph o'er the Pangs Of Misery and Pain! Queen. Low—low indeed, Have our Misfortunes plung'd us; when no Gleam Of wand'ring Hope, how vain soe'er or false, Our Invocation flatters!—When—O when Will Death deliver me!—Shall I not rest Within the peaceful Tomb, where I may sleep In calm Oblivion, and forget the Wrecks Of stormy Life!—No Sounds disturb the Grave, Of murther'd Husbands!—Or the dismal Scream Of Infants perishing.—Ha! whether leads Imagination!—Must ye perish then, Ye tender Blossoms!—Must the lofty Oak That gave you Life, and shelter'd you from Harm, Yield to the Traitor's Ax!—O Agony Of fond Distraction! Eleonora. Ha!—behold where comes The warlike Son of March!—What, if he brings The News of Victory! Queen. My Soul alarm'd, With Eagerness and Terror waits her Doom! SCENE II. Queen, Eleonora, Dunbar. Queen. Say, Youth, how fares the King! Dunbar. Fair Princess, hail! To you my Duty and my Speed were bent— Your royal Consort triumphs. Queen. Lives he then! Lives he, deliver'd from the fatal Snares Which had enclos'd him! Dunbar. To their Hills repell'd, The vanquish'd Rebels curse his conqu'ring Arm— He bade me fly before him to the Queen; With the glad Tidings chear her drooping Soul; And bear his kindest Wishes to the Shrine Himself will soon adore. Queen. Will he then come And wipe the Tear of Sorrow from my Cheek!— Ah, no!—thy Pity flatters me in vain! Dunbar. Let me not dally with my Queen's Distress.— What were it, but to lift incumbent Woe, That it might fall more grievous.—By the Faith Of my Allegiance, hither speeds the King, By Love attended, and by Conquest crown'd. Queen. O welcome Messenger!—How sweetly sounds Thy Prelude!—Thus, the warbler of the Morn, To the sick Wretch who moan'd the tedious Night, Brings balmy Slumber, Ease and Hope and Health! O wondrous Destiny! Eleonora. Thus, on my Queen May Fortune ever smile.—May Bliss to Bliss Succeed, a tranquil Scene!—Say, noble Youth, Returns my Sire in Safety from the Field?— Dunbar. Safe as thy fondest filial Wish can form.— In War's Variety, mine Eyes have seen Variety of Valour and of Skill: But such united Excellence of both— Such Art to baffle and amuse the Foe;— Such Intrepidity to execute Repeated Efforts,—never, save in him My Observation trac'd!—Our Monarch's Acts My feeble Praise would sully and profane. Eleonora. Thy Words, like genial Showers to the parch'd Earth, Refresh my languid Soul!— Queen. The Trumpet swells! My Conqueror approaches!—Let me fly With Extasy of Love into his Arms!— He comes!—the Victor comes!— SCENE III. King, Queen, Eleonora, Dunbar. King , embracing the Queen. My better Part!— My Soul's chief Residence!—my Love! my Queen! Thou hast been tender overmuch, and mourn'd Ev'n too profusely! Queen. Celebrate this Hour Ye Songs of Angels! and ye Sons of Earth, Keep Festival!—My Monarch is return'd! I fold him in these Arms!—I hear his Voice— His Love soft-chiding!— King. O ye Powers benign! What Words can speak the Rapture of my Soul! Come to my Breast, where, cherish'd by my Love, Thy fair Idea rooted, blossoms forth And twines around my Heart! Queen. Mysterious Fate! My Wishes are compleat!—Yet, I must ask A thousand Things, impertinently fond! How did you 'scape?—What Angel's Hand, my King, Preserv'd you from Destruction? King. Heav'n, indeed, Espous'd my Cause, and sent to my Relief The Son of March, who, with a chosen Few, Deliver'd me from Grime:—Thence to the Field We speeded, and accomplish'd what the Sword Of Angus had well nigh atchiev'd before. Queen , To Dunbar. How shall Acknowledgment enough reward Thy Worth unparallell'd? King. Now, by my Throne! Not my own Issue shall engross me, more Than thou, heroic Youth!—Th'insulting Foe, In spite of fresh Supplies, with Slaughter driven To the steep Hills that bound the Plain, have sent An Herald, in their Turn, to sue for Peace.— An Audience have I promis'd.—Ere the Hour Arrives, I will retire, and in the Bath Refresh my weary'd Limbs.— [Exeunt King, Queen, Attendants. SCENE IV. Dunbar, Eleonora. Eleonora. Renown, to Day Has lavish'd all her Honours on thy Head. Dunbar. What boots it, that my Fortune decks me thus With unsubstantial Plumes; when my Heart groans Beneath the gay Caparison, and Love With unrequited Passion wounds my Soul! Eleonora. Is unpropitious Love unknown to me? To me for ever doom'd (alas!) to nurse The slow-consuming Fire.— Dunbar. Heav'ns!—what are all The boasted Charms, that with such wond'rous Power Attach thee to my Rival?—Far from me Be the vain Arrogance of Pride, to vaunt Excelling Talents; yet I fain would learn, On what admir'd Accomplishment of Stuart, Thy Preference is fix'd.— Eleonora. Alas! Dunbar, My Judgment, weak and erring as it is, Too well discerns on whom I should bestow My Love and my Esteem:—But trust me, Youth, Thou little know'st how hard it is to wean The Mind from darling Habits long indulg'd! I know that Stuart sinks into Reproach: Immers'd in Guilt, and, more than once, subdu'd By thy superior Merit and Success: Yet even this Stuart,—for I would not wrong Thine Expectation,—still retains a Part Of my Compassion—nay, I fear, my Love!— Would'st thou, distinguish'd by th'Applause of Kings, Disgrace thy Qualities, and brook the Prize Of a divided Heart?— Dunbar. No!—witness Heav'n I love not on such Terms!—Am I then doom'd, Unfeeling Maid! for ever, to deplore Thy unabating Rigour!—The rude Flint Yields to th'incessant Drop; but Eleonora, Inflexibly severe, unchang'd remains— Unmov'd by my Complaint!— Eleonora. My Father comes! Let me, with pious Ravishment, embrace His martial Knees, and bless the guardian Power That screen'd him in the Battle! SCENE V. Angus, Dunbar, Eleonora. Angus. Rise my Child, Thou hast been always dutiful, and mild As the soft Breeze that fanns the Summer-Eve!— Such Innocence endearing, gently stole Into my youthful Bosom, and awak'd Loves tender Languishment, when to my View Thy Mother first display'd her Virgin Bloom! [Turning to Dunbar. Come to my Arms Dunbar!—To shield from Death A Parent, is the venerable Act Of the most pious Duty.—Thus adopted, Henceforward be my Son!—The rebel Chiefs Secure in my Safe-conduct, wait without The promis'd Audience.—To the King repair, And signify their Presence.— [Exit Dunbar. SCENE VI. Angus, Eleonora. Angus. Eleonora, Behold th'undaunted Youth, who stept between The Stroke of Fate and me.—O'erpow'r'd, unhors'd, And by the Foe surrounded, I had sunk A Victim to Barbarity enrag'd; If brave Dunbar, to his own Peril blind, Had not that Instant, to my Rescue sprung.— Nay, when that youthful Traitor—by whose Arm Releas'd, I know not, headlong rush'd against me; My vigilant Deliverer, oppos'd The fierce Aggressor, whose aspiring Crest Soon prostrate fell.— Eleonora. Ha! fell!—Is Stuart slain? O! speak my Father.— Angus. Wherefore this Alarm! Let me not find thy Bosom entertain A Sentiment unworthy of thy Name!— The gen'rous Victor gave him back his Life; And cry'd aloud, “This Sacrifice I make “For Eleonora's Love.”— Eleonora. O matchless Youth! His Virtues conquer'd my Esteem, before: But now, my grateful Sentiment inflames Ev'n to a Sister's Zeal! Angus. With rigid Power I would not bridle thy reluctant Thought: Yet, let me, with parental Care, commend The Passion of Dunbar.— Eleonora. A fairer Garb His Title could not wear:—But when I think What Rocks in secret he—what Tempests rise On Love's deceitful Voyage; my timid Soul Recoils affrighted, and with Horror shuns Th'inviting Calm!— Angus. Retire, my Child, and weigh The diff'rent Claims.—Here, Glory, Love and Truth Implore thy Smiles:—There, Vice with brutal Rage Would force thee to his Wishes.—But too long I tarry in this Place.—I must attend My Sov'reign in his Interview with Athol. [Exeunt. SCENE VII. Changes to another Apartment. Athol, Grime. Athol. What we to Fortune ow'd, our Arms have paid: But let us now, the Changeling Pow'r renounce.— Unhappy those, who hazard their Designs On her without Reserve!— Grime. Our Plan pursu'd A Purpose more assur'd:—With Conquest crown'd, Our Aim indeed, a fairer Wreath had worn: But that deny'd, on Terms of darker Hue Our Swords shall force Success!— Athol. Th'approaching Scene Demands our utmost Art! not with tame Sighs To bend before his Throne, and supplicate His Clemency, like Slaves; nor to provoke With Pride of Speech, his Anger half appeas'd: But with Submission mingle (as we speak) A conscious Dignity of Soul, prepar'd For all Events.— Grime. Without the City-Walls, The Southern Troops encamp'd, already fill The festal Bowl, to celebrate the Day.— Athol. By Heav'n! their flush'd Intemperance will yield Occasion undisturb'd.—For while they lie, With Wine and Sleep o'erwhelm'd; the Clans that lurk Behind th'adjacent Hills, shall in the Dark, Approach the Gate when our Associate Cattan Commands the Guard; then introduc'd by him, We take, with Ease, Possession of the Town, And hither move unmark'd.— Grime. Here, if we fail, May my shrunk Sinew never more unsheath My well-try'd Dagger; nor my hungry Hate Enjoy the sav'ry Steam of hostile Gore! Athol. How my fir'd Soul anticipates the Joy! I see me seated in the regal Chair, Enthron'd by Grime, the Partner of my Power!— But this important Enterprize demands More secret Conference.—The Sword of Stuart Will much avail: But his unpractic'd Youth To Doubts and Scruples subject, hitherto Declines our last Resolve.— Grime. It shall be mine, To rouse his Passion to the Pitch requir'd.— But soft!—who comes?—Ten thousand Curses load Th'ambitious Stripling! Enter Dunbar. By the King's Command, I come to guide you to the Throne. Athol. 'Tis well.— [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. Discovers the King seated, Angus, Attendants. Enter Athol, Grime, introduced by Dunbar. King. It is not well—it is not well we meet On Terms like these!—I should have found in Athol A trusty Counsellor and steady Friend: And better would it suit thy rev'rend Age, Thy Station, Quality, and kindred Blood, To hush ill-judging Clamour, and cement Divided Factions to my Throne, again, Than thus embroil the State.— Athol. My present Aim Is to repair, not widen more, the Breach That Discord made between us: This, my Liege, Not harsh Reproaches, or severe Rebuke Will e'er effectuate:—No—let us rather, On Terms which equally become us both, Our Int'rests re-unite. King. Hah!—re-unite! By Heav'n, thy proud Demeanor more befits A Sov'reign than a Subject!—Re-unite!— How durst thou sever from thy Faith, old Lord! And with an Helmet load that hoary Head To wage rebellious War! Athol. The Sword of Athol Was never drawn but to redress the Wrongs His Country suffer'd.— King. Dar'st thou to my Face, Impeach my Conduct, baffled as thou art, Ungrateful Traitor?—Is it thus, thy Guilt My Clemency implores? Athol. Not yet so low Has Fate reduc'd us, that we need to crawl Beneath your Footstool:—In our Camp remain Ten thousand vig'rous Mountaineers, who long Their Honours to retrieve.— King , rising hastily. Swift, hie thee to them, And lead thy fugitive Adherents back!— Away.—Now by the mighty Soul of Bruce! Thou shalt be met.—And if thy savage Clans Abide us in the Plain, we soon will tread Rebellion into Dust.—Why move ye not? Conduct them to their Camp.— Athol. Forgive, my Prince, If on my own Integrity of Heart Too far presuming, I have gall'd the Wound Too much inflam'd already.—Not with you, But with your Measures ill-advis'd, I warr'd: Your sacred Person, Family and Throne My Purpose still rever'd.— King. O wretched Plea, To which thy blasted Guilt must have Recourse! Had thy Design been laudable, thy Tongue With honest Freedom boldly should have spoke Thy Discontent.—Ye live not in a Reign Where Truth, by arbitrary Pow'r depress'd, Dares not maintain her State.—I charge thee, say What lawless Measures has my Pow'r pursu'd? Athol. I come, to mitigate your royal Wrath With Sorrow and Submission; not to sum The Motives which compell'd me to the Field.— King. I found your miserable State reduc'd To Ruin and Despair:—Your Cities drench'd In mutual Slaughter, desolate your Plains: All Order banish'd, and all Arts decay'd:— No Industry, save what with Hands impure Distress'd the Commonwealth:—No Laws in Force, To screen the Poor and check the guilty great; While squalid Famine join'd her Sister Fiend Devouring Pestilence, to curse the Scene!— I came,—I toil'd,—reform'd,—redress'd the whole: And lo, my Recompence!—But I relapse.— What is your Suit? Athol. We sue (my Liege) for Peace.— King. Say, that my Lenity should grant your Prayer, How, for the future, shall I rest assur'd Of your Allegiance? Athol. Stuart shall be left The Pledge of our Behaviour.— King. And your Arms Ere Noon to Morrow, shall be yielded up. Athol. This too, shall be perform'd.— King. Then mark me Thane.— Bacause the Loins, from whence my Father sprung, On thee too Life bestow'd; enjoy the Gift.— I pardon what is past.—In Peace consume The Winter of thy Days.—But, if ye light Th'extinguish'd Brand again, and brave my Throne With new Commotions:—By th'eternal Power! No future Guile, Submission, or Regard Shall check my Indignation!—I will pour My Vengeance in full Volley; and the Earth Shall dread to yield you Succour or Resource! Of this, no more.—Thy Kinsman shall remain With us, an Hostage of thy promis'd Faith.— So shall our Mercy with our Prudence join, United brighten, and securely shine. END of the Third ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Stuart. This Solitude but more foments Despair! Recals—compares—and to th'incessant Pangs Of Spite, Revenge, and Shame condemns my Soul!— O! what a miserable Slave am I!— Precipitated from the tow'ring Hope Of eagle-ey'd Ambition, to th'Abyss Of mutt'ring Horror, curs'd from Thought to Thought! —Hah Jealousy!—I feel th'infernal Power! Her hissing Snakes arrouse—her Torch inflames My madd'ning Soul!—Yes,—if he thus permits My Feet to range at will; my 'vengeful Hand Will soon requite him.— [Enter Grime. SCENE II. Stuart, Grime. Grime. Wherefore thus alone? Thy noble Kinsman, who now parted hence, Observes a sullen Cloud o'erhang thy Brow.— Since from the Dungeon to his Wish restor'd, A mute Aversion to his Love, secludes Thy lonely Steps— Stuart. Yes,—thou thyself hast nam'd The Cause accurs'd!—ha, from the Dungeon freed!— And freed by whom!—there's Poison in the Thought! —Am I not Hostage of my Uncle's Shame?— Grime. Thou dwell'st on that too much.—Few live exempt From Disappointment and Disgrace, who run Ambition's rapid Course.—Inur'd to Pain, The hard'ned Soul, at last, forgets to feel The Scourge of Fate; and fearless, rushes on To Deeds advent'rous.— Stuart. Who shall frame th'Attempt That Stuart dreads t'atchieve?—not Pestilence Not raging Seas, nor livid Flames can bound My dauntless Undertaking!—Tell me, Grime, For thou wast train'd to Feats of horrid Proof, Since, not the Voice of Heav'n itself, can lure My Honour back again;—what Pow'r of Hell Shall I invoke to deepen my Revenge?— Grime. Ha! Did'st thou say, Revenge?—Hail, sable Pow'r, To me more dear than Riches or Renown! What gloomy Joy, to drench the Dagger deep In the proud Heart of him who robb'd my Fame! My Fortune thwarted; or essay'd by Fraud To poison my Delights!— Stuart. Ha! thou hast rous'd The Scorpion-Thought that stings me!— —Mark me, Grime,— Our baffled Cause could not alarm me thus: If Conquest for the Foe declar'd to Day; Our Arms again the Vagrant might compel, And chain her to our Side.—But know, my Love Has been defrauded!—Eleonora's Heart That Wretch invades.—That Ravisher, who cropt My budding Fame and sunk me to Reproach! He, whom my Jealousy, in all its Rage, Hath singled for Destruction!— Grime. He shall die!— Stuart. Yes, he shall die!—He shall be flea'd—impal'd! And his torn Bowels thrown to Beasts of Prey!— My savage Hate shall on his Tortures feed! I will have Vengeance! Grime. Would'st thou have it full, Include his Patrons.— Stuart. Ha!—What—shall my Arm Unsheath the secret Steel! Grime. Yes.—Strike at once, For Liberty, Ambition and Revenge.— Let the proud Tyrant yield his haughty Soul: And all his Offspring swell the sanguine Stream. Let Angus perish too.— Stuart. O wond'rous Plan Of unrestrain'd Barbarity!—It suits The Horrors of my Bosom!—All!—What all? In slaughter'd Heaps.—The Progeny and Sire!— To sluice them in th'unguarded Hour of Rest!— Infernal Sacrifice!—dire—ev'n too dire For my Despair!—To me what have they done To merit such Returns?—No, my Revenge Demands the Blood of one, and he shall fall.— Grime. It shall suffice—Dunbar shall bleed alone.— But let us seize him on the Verge of Bliss; When the fond Maid's enkind'ling Looks confess The Flames of bashful Love: When eager Joy, And modest Fear, by Turns exalt the Blush To a more fervid Glow.—When Eleonora Unfolds Elysium to his raptur'd View, And smiles him to her Arms.— Stuart. Hah!—Light'ning scorch Thy Tongue, Blasphemer!—Sooner may this Globe Be hurl'd to the profound Abyss of Hell!— But vain are Words.—This is no Place—remember, He shall not triumph thus!—Thou hast bely'd him— He means it not.—Nor will the Syren smile— No, Grime,—she dares not smile him to her Arms! Grime. Reproach, or mute Disgust, is the Reward Of candid Friendship, that disdains to hide Unpalatable Truth!—I tell thee, Youth, Betroth'd by Angus to Dunbar, she yields Her plighted Faith, this Hour.—But see!—the Maid Moves hitherward alone!— Stuart. Haste,—leave me, Grime! My soul is up in Arms!—my Vengeance boils! Love, Jealousy, implacable Despair In Tempests wheel.— Grime. Thou shalt not tarry here!— Thy frantic Rage may rashly overturn Our whole Design!— Stuart. Let me not urge again Thy swift Departure!—hence—I come anon.— [Exit Grime. SCENE III. Stuart, Eleonora, Stuart. When last we parted, Love had reconcil'd Our mutual Jealousies; and breath'd anew The Soul of Harmony within our Breasts.— Hast thou not, since that Period, entertain'd One adverse Thought to Constancy and me? Eleonora. Say, who invested thee with Pow'r supreme O'er Eleonora's Conduct; that thou com'st With frowning Aspect, thus, to judge my Fame?— Hast thou not forfeited all Claim to me? Have I not seen thee stray from Honour's Path? And shall my Love be to the Breast confin'd, Where Treason in her darkest Hue presides!— No!—let me wipe thee, blotted as thou art, From my abhorrent Thoughts!— Stuart. Not all this Pride Of mimic Virtue—not th'assembled Host Of female Wiles, how exquisite soe'er, Shall shelter thee, Deceiver!—What new Stain Defiles my Bosom, since the Morning saw Thy Tenderness o'erflow; and heard thy Tongue Seduce me to thy faithless Arms, again? Eleonora. Is this the Testimony of thy Love? This thy asserted Honour! to revile Defenceless Innocence?—But this will aid My Duty, to forget thee.—Do'st thou ask What recent Outrage has estrang'd my Heart?— There needed none.—The Measure of thy Guilt Was full enough before.—Yet thou hast heap'd Offences to Excess: In Battle fought Against thy King; and sought, with lifted Arm, My Father's Life—ungrateful as thou art! Know then, the Honour of my Name forbids Our Fates to join; and it shall ne'er be said, That Eleonora, lost to Glory, took A Traitor to her Bed!— Stuart. Perfidious Witch! Thy Charms shall not avail thee; for I come Th'avenging Minister of broken Faith! To claim the promis'd Fruitage of my Love— Or—mark me—punish, with thy guilty Blood, Thy Perjury and Fraud!— Eleonora. Wilt thou attempt To gain by Menaces, what the soft Sigh Of plaintive Anguish, would implore in vain? Here strike—and let thy ruthless Poignard drink The Blood of Douglas, which has often flow'd In Virtue's Cause; and ev'ry Soil enrich'd, From wintry Scania to the sacred Vale Where Lebanon exalts his lofty Brow.— Stuart. Egregious Sorc'ress!—give me back my Peace— Bid Yesterday return, that saw my Youth Adorn'd in all its Splendor, and elate With gen'rous Pride and Dignity of Soul!— Ere yet thy Spells had discompos'd my Brain, Unstrung my Arm, and laid me in the Dust, Beneath a Rival's Feet!— Eleonora. Hear all ye Powers! He claims of me, what his own conscious Guilt Hath robb'd him of.—And do'st thou look for Peace In my afflicted Bosom?—There, indeed, Thine Image dwells with Solitude and Care, Amid the Devastation thou hast made! [Weeps. Stuart. O Crocodile!—Curse on these faithless Drops Which fall, but to ensnare!—Thy specious Words Shall sooner lull the sounding Surge, than check The Fury that impels me!—Yet—by Heav'n, Thou art divinely fair! and thy Distress With magic Softness ev'ry Charm improves!— Wer't thou not false as Hell, not Paradise Could more Perfection boast!—O! let me turn My fainting Eyes from thy resistless Face; And from my Sense exclude the soothing Sound Of thy inchanting Tongue!—Yet—yet renounce Thine Infidelity—To thine Embrace Receive this Wanderer—this Wretch forlorn!— Speak Peace to his distracted Soul; and ease The Tortures of his Bosom!— Eleonora. Hapless Youth! My Heart bleeds for thee!—careless of her own, Bleeds o'er thy Sorrows!—'mid the flinty Rocks My tender Feet would tread, to bring thee Balm: Or, unrepining, tempt the pathless Snow!— O! could my Death recall thy banish'd Quiet! Here would I kneel, a Suppliant to Heav'n, In thy Behalf; and offer to the Grave The Price of thy Repose!—Alas! I fear Our Days of Pleasure are for ever past! Stuart. O thou hast Joy and Horror in thy Gift! And sway'st my Soul at Will!—bless'd in thy Love, The Memory of Sorrow and Disgrace, That preys upon my Youth, would soon forsake My raptur'd Thought, and Hell should plot in vain, To sever us again!—O! let me clasp thee, Thou Charm ineffable! Eleonora. Forbear, fond Youth, Our unrelenting Destiny hath rais'd Eternal Bars between us! Stuart. Ha!—what Bars? Eleonora. A Sacrifice demanded by my Sire— A Vow— Stuart. Perdition!—Say what Vow, rash Maid! Eleonora. A fatal Vow! that blasts our mutual Love— Stuart. Infernal Vipers gnaw thy Heart!—A Vow!— A Vow that to my Rival gives thee up!— Shall he then trample on my Soul at last.— Mock my Revenge and laugh at my Despair! Ha!—shall he rifle all thy Sweets, at Will, And riot in the Transports due to me? Th'accursed Image whirls around my Brain!— He pants with Rapture!—Horror to my Soul! He surfeits on Delight!— Eleonora. O gentle Heav'n! Let thy soft Mercy on his Soul descend In Dews of Peace!—Why roll with fiery Gleam Thy starting Eye-Balls?—Why on thy pale Cheek Trembles fell Rage!—and why sustains thy Frame This universal Shock?—Is it, alas! That I have sworn, I never will be thine?— True, this I swore— Stuart. Hah!—never to be mine! Th'awaken'd Hurricane begins to rage!— Be Witness, Heav'n, and Earth, and Hell! she means To glad the Bosom of my Foe!—Come then Infernal Vengeance! aid me to perform A Deed that Fiends themselves will weep to see! [Draws. Thus, let me blast his full-bloom'd— Enter Dunbar, who interposes. SCENE IV. Dunbar, Stuart, Eleonora. Dunbar. Ruffian, hold Thy desp'rate Hand!—What Fury 'scap'd from Hell, Inspires thy Rage to wanton in the Blood Of such excelling Goodness?— Stuart. Infamy Like mine, deface the Glories of thy Name! What busy Dæmon sent thee hither, now, My Vengeance to defeat?—The Hour is come— The Hour is come at last, that must decide For ever our Pretensions! Dunbar. Whatsoe'er Thy Hate could meditate against my Life, My Nature might forgive: But this Attempt Divests my Soul of Mercy— Stuart. Guide my Point Ye Pow'rs of Darkness, to my Rival's Heart, Then take me to yourselves. [They fight. Eleonora. Restrain—restrain Your mutual Frenzy!—Horror!—help—behold— Behold this miserable Bosom!—plunge Your Poignards here; and in its fatal Source Your Enmity assuage!— Stuart falling. It will not be— Thy Fortune hath eclips'd me: And the Shades Of Death environ me.—Yet, what is Death When Honour brings it, but th'eternal Seal Of Glory, never—never to be broke!— O thou hast slain me in a dreadful Hour! My Vengeance frustrated—my Prospect curs'd With thy approaching Nuptials! and my Soul Dismiss'd in all her—Eleonora!—Oh! [Dies. SCENE V. Dunbar, Eleonora. Dunbar. Ah! wherefore dost thou wring thy tender Hands In woeful Attitude?—ah! wherefore lift Thy streaming Eyes to Heav'n; while the deep Groan Dilates thy lab'ring Breast? Eleonora. This is too much— This is too much to bear!—thou hast destroy'd My last Remains of Peace! Dunbar. And, was thy Peace Deposited in him?—In him who rais'd His impious Hand to kill thee!—Is it well To mourn his Fall, and thus accuse the Blow That rescu'd thee from Death? Eleonora. I blame not thee, No, Heav'n forbid!—I blame not my Protector— Yet thy Protection has undone me quite! And I will mourn—for ever mourn the Hour— Th'ill-omen'd Hour, that on thy Sword conferr'd Such terrible Success—How pale appear These clay-cold Cheeks where Grace and Vigour glow'd! O dismal Spectacle!—How humble now Lies that Ambition which was late so proud!— Did he not call me with his latest Breath!— He would have said—but cruel Fate controul'd His fault'ring Tongue!—He would have said, “For thee, “For thee false Maid, I perish undeplor'd!” O! had'st thou known how obstinately true My Heart remained to thee, when thy own Guilt, My Duty, and thy Rival's Worth, conspir'd To banish thee from thence; thy parting Soul Would have acquitted—nay, perhaps, bewail'd My persecuted Truth! Dunbar. O turn thine Eyes From the sad Object!—Turn thy melting Thoughts From the disastrous Theme, and look on me— On me who would with Exstasy resign This wretched Being, to be thus embalm'd With Eleonora's Tears!—Were I to fall, Thy Pity would not thus lament my Fate! Eleonora. Thy Death, such Lamentation would not move, More envy'd than bemoan'd;—thy Memory Would still be cherish'd, and thy Name survive To latest Ages, in immortal Bloom.— Ah, 'tis not so with him!—He leaves behind No dear Remembrance of unsully'd Fame! No Monument of Glory, to defy The Storms of Time!—Nought but Reproach and Shame! Nought, but perpetual Slander, brooding o'er His Reputation lost!—O fearful Scene Of dire Existence, that must never close! SCENE VI. Angus entring, Eleonora, Dunbar, Attendants. Angus. What Sound of femal Woe—Ha! Stuart slain! Alas! I fear thou art the fatal Cause! [To Eleonora. Eleonora. Too well my Father has divin'd the Cause Of their unhappy Strife!—Wherefore, ye Powers! Am I to Misery deliver'd up! What kindred Crime (alas!) am I decreed To expiate, that Misfortunes fall so thick On my poor Head! Angus to Dunbar. How durst your lawless Rage Profane this sacred Place with private Brawl! Dunbar. By Heav'n! no Place how much soe'er rever'd, Shall screen th'Assassin who, like him, would aim The murd'rous Steel at Eleonora's Breast! Angus. Ha!—were his Aims so merciless?—Too just The Vengeance that o'ertook him!—But th'Event With this unstable Juncture ill accords!— Remove the Body.—Thou meanwhile retire, Thy Presence may awake, or aggravate The Rage of Athol. [The Body is removed. Dunbar. Therefore I obey.— And O thou lovely Mourner! who now droop'st Like the spread Rose beneath th'inclement Shower, When next we meet, I hope to see thee bloom With vernal Freshness, and again unfold Thy Beauties to the Sun! [Exit Dunbar. SCENE VII. Angus, Eleonora. Angus. Let us, my Child, Lament with Steadiness, those Ills that flow From our Mishap: Yet therefore not ascribe To self Demerit, impotently griev'd, The Guilt of Accident.—Thou hast enough Denoted thy Concern.—Let me not think, Thy Sorrow hath espoused a Traitor's Cause. Eleonora. Ah! what avails to me, the hard won Palm Of fruitless Virtue?—Will it lull to Rest Internal Anguish!—Will it yield me Peace?— Angus. Thy indiscreet Affliction, shall not plead Against thee, with me, now.—Remember this, If thou art weak enough to harbour still A guilty Flame; to thy Assistance call That noble Pride and Dignity of Scorn, Which warms, exalts and purifies the Soul.— But I will trust thee to thyself.—Withdraw; For Athol comes, and on his Visage lours A Storm of Wrath. [Exit Eleonora. SCENE VIII. Angus, Athol. Athol. Are these the fair Effects Of our Submission!—These, the promis'd Fruits Of Amity restor'd!—To violate The Laws of Hospitality—To guide The midnight Murderer's inhuman Blow, And sacrifice your Guests! Angus. That Athol mourns This unforeseen Severity of Fate, I marvel not.—My own paternal Sense Is wak'd by Sympathy; and I condole His interesting Loss.—But thus to tax Our blameless Faith with traiterous Design, Not with our pure Integrity conforms, Nor with thy Duty, Thane. Athol. Ha!—who art thou, That I should bear thy Censure and Reproof?— Not Protestation, nor th'affected Air Of Sympathy and Candour, shall amuse My strong Conception, nor elude the Cry Of Justice and Revenge! Angus. Had Justice crav'd With rigid Voice, the Debt incurr'd by thee, How had'st thou far'd?—Say, what has plac'd thy Deeds Above my Censure?—Let this Day's Event Proclaim how far I merit thy Disdain.— That my Humanity is misconceived Not much alarms my Wonder: Conscious Fraud Still harbours with Suspicion.—Let me tell thee— The Fate of Stuart was supremely just. Th'untimely Stroke his savage Heart prepar'd Against the guiltless Breast of Eleonora, Avenging Heav'n retorted on himself. Athol. I thought where all thy Probity would end, Disguis'd Accomplice!—But remember, Lord, Should this blood-spotted Bravo 'scape, secure In thy Protection, or th'unjust Extent Of regal Pow'r; by all my Wrongs! I'll spread Th'Seeds of Vengeance o'er th'affrighted Land, And Blood shall answer Blood! Angus. How far thy Threats Are to be fear'd, we know.—But see, the King!— SCENE IX. King, Angus, Athol. King. Tell me—proud Thanes, why are ye found oppos'd In loud Revilings?—You, that should promote By fair Example, Unity and Peace! Athol. Have I not Cause to murmur and complain? Stuart, the latest Gift and dearest Pledge Of Love fraternal, sooth'd my bending Age: Him hath the unrelenting Dagger torn From my parental Arms; and left (alas!) This sapless Trunk, to stretch its wither'd Boughs To you for Justice!—Justice then I crave. King. To send the injur'd unredress'd away, How great soe'er the Offender, or the Wrong'd Howe'er obscure, is wicked—weak and vile: Degrades, defiles and should dethrone a King! Say freely, Thane, who has aggriev'd thee thus, And were he dear as her who shares our Throne, Thou shalt have ample Vengeance. Athol. Then I charge The Son of March with Perfidy and Murder. Angus. Were I with mean Indifference to hear Th'envenom'd Tongue of Calumny traduce Defenceless Worth, I should but ill deserve Your royal Confidence.—Dunbar has slain The Kinsman of this Thane; yet fell he not By Murder, Cowardice, or foul Design. The Sword of Stuart was already drawn To sacrifice my Daughter, when Dunbar, By Heav'n directed hither, interpos'd, Redeem'd the trembling Victim, and repell'd His Rival's Fury on his hapless Head. Athol. Must I refer me to the partial Voice Of an invet'rate Foe?—No, I reject The tainted Evidence, and rather claim The Combat Proof—Enfeebled are my Limbs With Age that creeps along my Nerves unstrung, Yet shall the Justice of my Cause recal My youthful Vigour, rouse my loit'ring Blood, Swell ev'ry Sinew, strengthen ev'ry Limb, And crown me with Success—Behold my Gage— I wait for Justice. King. Justice shalt thou have— Nor shall an equitable Claim depend On such precarious Issue.—Who shall guard The Weak from Violence, if brutal Force May vindicate Oppression.—Truth alone Shall rule the fair Decision, and thy Wrongs, If thou art wrong'd, in my unbyass'd Sway Shall find a just Avenger.—Let Dunbar Appear when urg'd, and Answer to the Charge. [To Angus. [Exeunt King, Angus. SCENE X. Athol, Grime. Athol. Curse on the smooth Dissembler!—Welcome Grime. My Soul is wrought to the sublimest Rage Of horrible Revenge!—If aught remain'd Of cautious Scruple, to the scatt'ring Winds I give the Phantome.—May this Carcase rot, A loathsome Banquet to the Fowls of Heav'n, If e'er my Breast admit one Thought to bound The Progress of my Hate! Grime. What means my Prince? Athol. Th'unhappy Youth is slain! Grime. Ha!—Hell be prais'd— He was a peevish Stripling, prone to Change. [Aside —Vain is Condolance.—Let our Swords be swift To sate his hov'ring Shade.—I have conferr'd With trusty Cattan, our Design explain'd, And his full Aid secur'd—To Night, he rules The middle Watch.—The Clans already move In Silence o'er the Plain. Athol. Come then ye Powers That dwell with Night, and patronize Revenge! Attend our Invocation, and confirm Th'exterminating Blow!—My Boughs are lopt, But they will sprout again: My vig'rous Trunk Shall flourish from the Wound my Foes have made, And yet again, project an awful Shade.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. SCENE I. King, Queen, Dunbar. Queen. O! this was more than the ill-sorted Train Of undetermin'd Fancy!—This convey'd No loose imperfect Images: But all Was dreadfully distinct! as if the Hand Of Fate had wrought it.—Profit by those Signs— Your guardian Angel dictates.—O my Prince! Let not your blind Security disgrace The Merit of your Prudence. King. No, my Queen, Let us avoid the opposite Extremes Of Negligence supine, and prostrate Fear.— Already hath our Vigilance perform'd What Caution justifies: And for thy Dream; As such consider it.—The vain Effect Of an Imagination long disturb'd.— Life with substantial Ills, enough is curs'd: Why should we then, with frantic Zeal, pursue Unreal Care; and with th'illusive Form Which our own teeming Brain produc'd, affright Our Reason from her Throne? Queen. In all your Course Of youthful Glory, when the guiding Hand Of warlike Henry led you to the Field; When my Soul suffer'd the successive Pangs Of fond Impatience and repressive Fear: When ev'ry reeking Messenger from France, Wreath'd a new Garland for Albania's Prince, And shook my Bosom with the dreadful Tale That spoke your Praise; say, did my weak Despair Recal you from the Race?—Did not my Heart Espouse your Fame, and patiently await The End of your Career?—O! by the Joys I felt at your Return, when smiling Love Secure, with Rapture reign'd.—O! by these Tears, Which seldom plead; indulge my boding Soul! Arrouse your conqu'ring Troops; let Angus guard The Convent with a chosen Band.—The Soul Of Treason is abroad!— King. Ye ruling Powers! Let me not wield the Sceptre of this Realm, When my degen'rate Breast becomes the Haunt Of haggard Fear.—O! what a Wretch is he, Whose fev'rous Life devoted to the gloom Of Superstition, feels th'incessant Throb Of ghastly Pannic!—In whose startled Ear The Knell still deepens, and the Raven croaks! Queen. Vain be my Terrors—my Presages vain— Yet with my fond Anxiety comply, And my Repose restore!—Not for myself— Not to prolong the Season of my Life, Am I thus suppliant.—Ah no! for you— For you whose Being gladdens and protects A grateful People.—You, whose parent Boughs Defends your tender Offspring from the Blasts That soon would tear them up!—For you, the Source Of all our Happiness and Peace, I fear! [Kneels. King. Arise, my Queen—O! thou art all compos'd Of melting Piety and tender Love! Thou shalt be satisfy'd.—Is ev'ry Guard By Angus visited?— Dunbar. Ev'n now, my Liege, With Ramsay and his Troop, he scours the Plain. King. Still watchful o'er his Charge.—The lib'ral Hand Of Bounty will have nothing to bestow, 'Ere Angus cease to merit!—Say, Dunbar, Who rules the nightly Watch? Dunbar. To Cattan's Care The City Guard is subject. King. I have mark'd. Much Valour in him.—Hie thee to him, Youth, And bid him with a chosen few, surround The Cloisters of the Convent; and remain 'Till Morn full streaming shall relieve his Watch. [Exit Dunbar. Thus shall Repose, with glad Assurance, waft Its balmy Blessing to thy troubled Breast. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Grime, Cattan. Grime. Thus far, brave Cattan, Fortune seems inclin'd To recompense us for the Day's Disgrace.— Our Band conceal'd within the Cloisters, wait With Eagerness and Joy the auspicious Hour, To perpetrate the Deed.—It now remains, To regulate our Conduct, and to each His Share of this great Enterprize assign.— If Angus lives, in vain our Arms devote The Usurper and his Progeny to Death: His Power and Principles will still supply Fresh Obstacles, which all our future Efforts Can ne'er surmount. Cattan. Then let our Swords prevent All further Opposition, and at once Dismiss him to the Shades. Grime. Thine be the Task— I know with what just Indignation burns Thy gen'rous Hate, against the partial Thane, Who, to thine Age and Services, preferr'd A raw unpractis'd Stripling. Cattan. Ha!—no more. The bare Remembrance tortures me!—O Grime! How will my Soul his mortal Groans enjoy! Grime. While we within perform th'intrepid Blow, To his Apartment thou shalt move alone; Nor will Pretence be wanting: Say, thou bring'st Intelligence important, that demands His instant Ear:—Then shalt thou find thy Foe Unarm'd and unattended.—Need my Tongue Instruct thee further? Cattan. No,—let my Revenge Suggest what follows—By the Pow'rs of Hell! I will be drunk with Vengeance! Grime. To thy Guard Meanwhile repair, and watch 'till he returns With Ramsay from the Plain.—But see! they come, We must avoid them, and retire unseen. [Exeunt. SCENE III. An Apartment. Angus, Ramsay. Angus. By Heav'n, it much alarms me!—Wide o'er all The dusky Plain, by the Fires half extinct, Are seen the soldiers, roll'd in Heaps confus'd, The Slaves of brutal Appetite.—Save those Beneath thy Discipline, scarce one remains From the Contagion free. Ramsay. When we return'd Fatigu'd from Battle, Numbers brought, unask'd, Refreshments for the wounded from the Town: Thence, the Temptation spread from Rank to Rank, And few resisted. Angus. But that I consult My King's Tranquillity, and would not wake Th'affrighted Citizens with an Alarm, An hundred Trumpets should this instant, raise Their brazen Throats together, and arrouse Th'extended Sluggards.—Go, my valiant Friend, And with thy uninfected Troop attend To ev'ry Motion of th'incertain Night. [Exit Ramsay. SCENE IV. Angus. Now, the loud Tempest of the toilful Day Subsides into a Calm.—And yet my Soul Still labours thro' the Storm!—By Day or Night, In florid Youth, or mellow Age, scarce fleets One Hour without its Care!—Not Sleep itself Is ever balmy; for the shadowy Dream Oft bears substantial Woe! SCENE V. Angus, Cattan. Cattan. My noble Lord, Within the Portal as I kept my Watch, Swift gliding Shadows by the glimm'ring Moon, I could perceive in Forms of armed Men, Possess the Space that borders on the Porch— I question'd thrice; they yielded no Reply: And now the Soldiers, rang'd in close Array, Wait your Command. Angus. Quick, lead me to the Place— Foul Treason is at work!— Cattan. It were not good To venture forth unarm'd.—Couragious Thane, Receive this Dagger.— [Attempts to stab Angus, who wrests the Dagger from him, and kills him. Angus. Ha, perfidious Slave! What means this base Attempt?—Thou shalt not 'scape. Cattan. Curse on my feeble Arm that fail'd to strike The Poignard to thy Heart!—How like a Dog I tamely fall despis'd! Angus. Fell Ruffian! say, Who set thee on?—This Treachery, I fear, Is but the prelude to some dreadful Scene!— Cattan. Just are thy Terrors.—By the infernal Gulph That opens to receive me! I would plunge Into the Abyss with Joy, could the Success Of Athol feast my Sense! [A Noise of clashing Swords and Shreiks. —Hah!—now the Sword Of Slaughter smoaks!—Th'exulting Thane surveys Th'imperial Scene; while grimly smiling Grime With purple Honours deck'd.— Angus. Tremend'ous Powers! Cattan. O'er the faln Tyrant strides— [Dies. Angus. Heav'n sheild us all! Amazing Horror chills me!—Ha, Dunbar! Then Treason triumphs!—O my Son! my Son! SCENE VI. Angus, Dunbar wounded. Dunbar. I sought thee, noble Thane, while yet my Limbs Obey their Lord.—I sought thee, to unfold My zealous Soul, 'ere yet she takes her Flight.— Stretch'd on the Ground, these Eyes beheld the King Transfix'd a lifeless Coarse! And saw this Arm Too late to save—too feeble to avenge him!— Angus. Weep Caledonia, weep!—thy Peace is slain— Thy Father and thy King!—O! this Event, Like a vast Mountain, loads my staggring Soul, And crushes all her Pow'rs!—But say, my Friend, If yet thy Strength permits, how this befel. Dunbar. A Band of Rebels, glean'd from the Defeat, By Athol, lurk'd behind the adjacent Hills: These, faithless Cattan, favour'd by the Night, Admitted to the City, join'd their Power With his corrupted Guard, and hither led them Unmark'd, where soon they enter'd unoppos'd.— Alarm'd, I strove—but strove, alas! in vain. To the sad Scene 'ere I could force my Way, Our Monarch was no more! Around him lay An Heap of Traitors, whom his single Arm Had slain before he fell.—Th'unhappy Queen, Who, to defend her Consort's, had oppos'd Her own defenceless Frame, expiring, pour'd Her mingling Blood in copious Stream with his! Angus. Illustrious Victims!—O disast'rous Fate! Unfeeling Monsters! Execrable Fiends! To wanton thus in royal Blood! Dunbar. O Thane! How shall I speak the Sequel of my Tale! How will thy fond parental Heart be rent With mortal Anguish, when my Tongue relates The Fate of Eleonora! Angus. Ha!—my Fears Anticipate thy Words!—O say, Dunbar, How fares my Child! Dunbar. The Shades of endless Night Now settle o'er her Eyes!—heroic Maid! She to th'assaulted Threshold bravely ran, And with her snowy Arm, supply'd a Bolt To bar their Entrance:—But the barb'rous Crew Broke in impet'ous, crush'd her slender Limb, When Grime, his Dagger brandishing, exclaim'd, Behold the Sorc'ress whose accursed Charms Betray'd the Youth; and whose invet'rate Sire This Day revers'd our Fortune in the Field!— This for Revenge!—then plung'd it in her Breast!— Angus. Infernal Homicide! Dunbar. There—there I own He vanquish'd me indeed!—What tho' I rush'd Thro' many a Wound, and in th'Assassin's Heart Imbrew'd my faithful Steel.—But see, where comes By her Attendants led, the bleeding Fair! SCENE VII. Angus, Dunbar, Eleonora wounded and supported. Eleonora. Here set me down—vain is your kind Concern.— Ah! who, with parent Tenderness, will bless My parting Soul, and close my beamless Eyes! Ah! who defend me, and with pious Care To the cold Grave commit my pale Remains! [Swoons. Angus. O Misery!—look up—thy Father calls— [Embracing her. Eleonora. What Angel borrows that paternal Voice! Ha! lives my Father!—Ye propitious Powers! He folds me in his Arms—Yes, he survives The Havock of this Night!—O let me now Yield up my fervent Soul with raptur'd Praise! For Angus lives t'avenge his murder'd Prince, To save his Country, and protract his Blaze Of Glory, farther still! Angus. And is it thus, The melting Parent clasps his darling Child! My Heart is torn with agonizing Pangs Of complicated Woe! Dunbar. The Public craves Immediate Aid from thee—But I wax weak.— Our Infant King surrounded in the Fort, Demands thy present Help.— Angus. Yes, loyal Youth! Thy glorious Wounds instruct me, what I owe To my young Sov'reign, and my Country's Peace! But how shall I sustain the rav'nous Tribe Of various Griefs, that gnaw me all at once? My royal Master falls, my Country groans, And cruel Fate has ravish'd from my Side My dearest Daughter and my best lov'd Friend! Dunbar. Thy Praise shall be thy Daughter; and thy Friend Survive unchang'd in ev'ry honest Breast. Angus. Must we then part for ever!—What a Plan Of peaceful Happiness, my Hope had laid In thee and her!—alas! thou fading Flower, How fast thy Sweets consume!—come to my Arms, That I may taste them e're they fleet away! [Embracing her. O exquisite Distress!— Eleonora. For me, my Father, For me let not the bootless Tear distil.— Soon shall I be with those, who rest secure From all th'Inclemencies of stormy Life. Angus. Adieu, my Children!—never shall I hear Thy chearing Voice again!—a long Farewell! [Exit Angus. SCENE VIII. Dunbar, Eleonora. Dunbar. Soon shall our short'ned Race of Life be run.— Our Day already hastens to its Close; And Night eternal comes.—Yet, tho' I touch The Land of Peace, and backward view, well pleas'd, The tossing Wave from which I shall be free: No Rest will greet me on the silent Shore, If Eleonora sends me hence unbless'd. Eleonora. Distemper'd Passion (when we parted last) Usurp'd my troubled Bosom, and Dunbar With Horror was beheld: But Reason now With genial Mildness beams upon my Soul, And represents thee justly, as thou art, The tend'rest Lover and the gentlest Friend. Dunbar. O Transport, to my Breast unknown before! Not the soft Breeze, upon its fragrant Wings, Wafts such refreshing Gladness to the Heart Of panting Pilgrims, as thy balmy Words To my exhausted Spirits!—but alas! Thy purple Stream of Life forsakes, apace, Its precious Channels!—on thy polish'd Cheek The blowing Roses fade; and o'er thine Eyes Death sheds a misty Languor! Eleonora. Let me lean Upon thy friendly Arm—Yet, O retire! That guilty Arm!—Say, did it ne'er rebel Against my Peace?—But let me not revolve Those Sorrows now.—Were Heav'n again to raise That once lov'd Head that lies (alas) so low! And from the Verge of Death my Life recal; What Joy could visit my forlorn Estate, Self-doom'd to hopeless Woe! Dunbar. Must I then wander A pensive Shade, along the dreary Vale, And groan for ever under thy Reproach! Eleonora. Ah no! thou faithful Youth, shall I repay Thy Love and Virtue with ungrateful Hate? These Wounds that waste so lavishly thy Life, Were they not all receiv'd in my Defence? May no Repose embrace me in the Tomb, If my Soul mourns not thy untimely Fall With Sister-Woe!—thy Passion has not reap'd The sweet Returns its Purity deserv'd. Dunbar. A while forbear, pale Minister of Fate, Forbear a while; and on my ravish'd Ear Let the last Music of this dying Swan, Steal in soft Blandishment, divinely sweet! Then strike th'unerring Blow.— Eleonora. That thus, our Hopes Which blossom'd num'rous as the flow'ry Spring, Are nipp'd untimely, ere the Sun of Joy Matur'd them into Fruit; repine not, Youth.— Life hath its various Seasons, as the Year; And after clust'ring Autumn—but I faint— Support me nearer—in rich Harvest's Rear Bleak Winter must have lagg'd.—Oh! now I feel The leaden Hand of Death lie heavy on me.— Thine Image swims before my straining Eye.— —And now it disappears.—Speak—bid Adieu To the lost Eleonora.—Not a Word! —Not one Farewell!—Alas! that dismal Groan Is eloquent Distress!—Celestial Powers Protect my Father, show'r upon his—Oh! [Dies. Dunbar. There fled the purest Soul that ever dwelt In mortal Clay!—I come my Love! I come— Where now the rosy Tincture of these Lips! The Smile that Grace ineffable diffus'd! The Glance that smote the Soul with silent Wonder! The Voice that sooth'd the Anguish of Disease, And held Attention Captive!—Let me kiss This pale deserted Temple of my Joy! This, Chastity, this, thy unspotted Shade Will not refuse.—I feel the griesly King— Thro' all my Veins he shivers like the North— O Eleonora! as my flowing Blood Is mix'd with thine.—So may our mingling Souls To Bliss supernal wing our happy—Oh! [Dies. SCENE the Last. Angus, Ramsay. Athol, &amp;c. Prisoners. Angus. Bright Deeds of Glory hath thine Arm atchiev'd, Couragious Ramsay; and thy Name shall live For ever in the Annals of Renown.— —But see, where silent as the Noon of Night These Lovers lie!—rest—rest ill-fated Pair! Your dear Remembrance shall for ever dwell Within the Breast of Angus; and his Love Oft with paternal Tears bedew your Tomb! Ramsay. O fatal Scene of Innocence destroy'd! Angus , To Athol. O bloody Author of this Night's Mishap! Whose impious Hands are with the sacred Blood Of Majesty distain'd!—Contemplate here The Havock of thy Crimes; and then bethink thee, What Vengeance craves.— Athol. With Insolence of Speech How dares thy Tongue licentious, thus insult Thy Sov'reign, Angus?—Madly hath thy Zeal Espous'd a sinking Cause.—But thou may'st still Deserve my future Favour.— Angus. O thou Stain Of fair Nobility!—thou Bane of Faith! Thou Woman-killing Coward, who hast crept To the unguarded Throne, and stabb'd thy Prince! What hath thy Treason, blasted as it is, To bribe the Soul of Angus to thy Views? Athol. Soon shalt thou rue th'Indignity now thrown On me thy lawful Prince.—Yes, talking Lord, The Day will soon appear, when I shall rise In Majesty and Terror, to assert My Country's Freedom; and at last, avenge My own peculiar Wrongs.—When thou, and all Those grov'ling Sycophants, who bow'd the Knee To the Usurper's arbitrary Sway, Will fawn on me.—Ye temporizing Slaves! Unchain your King; and teach your humble Mouths To kiss the Dust beneath my royal Feet.— [To the Guard. Angus. The Day will soon appear!—Day shall not thrice Return, before thy Carcase be cast forth Unbury'd, to the Dogs and Beasts of Prey.— Or, high-exalted, putrify in Air The Monument of Treason.— Athol. Empty Threat! Fate hath foretold that Athol shall be crown'd. Angus. Then Hell hath cheated thee.—Thou shalt be crown'd— An Iron Crown, intensely hot, shall gird Thy hoary Temples; while the shouting Crowd Acclaims thee King of Traitors. Athol. Lakes of Fire!— Ha! said'st thou Lord!—a glowing Iron Crown Shall gird my hoary Temples!—Now I feel Myself awake to Misery and Shame! Ye Sceptres, Diadems and rolling Trains Of flatt'ring Pomp, farewell!—Curse on those Dreams Of idle Superstition, that ensnare Th'ambitious Soul to Wickedness and Woe! Curse on thy Virtue, which hath overthrown My elevated Hopes! and may Despair Descend in Pestilence on all Mankind! Angus. Thy Curse just Heav'n retorts upon thyself! To sep'rate Dungeons lead the Regicides.— [Exit Guard with the Prisoners. From Thirst of Rule what dire Disasters flow! How flames that Guilt Ambition taught to glow! Wish gains on Wish, Desire surmounts Desire; Hope fanns the Blaze, and Envy feeds the Fire: From Crime to Crime aspires the madd'ning Soul; Nor Laws, nor Oaths, nor Fears its Rage controul; 'Till Heav'n at length awakes, supremely just, And levels all its tow'ring Schemes in Dust!
