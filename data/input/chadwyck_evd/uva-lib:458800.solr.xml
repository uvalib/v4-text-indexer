      <field name="fulltext">THE INDVCTION; OR, CHORUS. Two Gentlemen entring upon the Stage. Mr. Probee and Mr. Damplay. A Boy of the house, meets them. Boy. What doe you lack, Gentlemen? what is't you lack? any fine Phansies, Figures, Humors, Characters, Idæas, Definitions of Lords, and Ladies? Waiting-women, Parasites, Knights, Captaines, Courtiers, Lawyers? what doe you lack? Pro. A pretty prompt Boy for the Poëtique Shop. Dam. And a bold! where's one o' your Masters, Sirrah, the Poet? Boy. Which of 'hem? Sir wee have divers that drive that trade, now: Poëts, Poet'accios, Poetasters, Poetito's— Dam. And all Haberdashers of small wit, I presume: wee would speake with the Poët o' the day, Boy. Boy. Sir, hee is not here. But, I have the dominion of the Shop, for this time, under him, and can shew you all the variety the Stage will afford for the present. Pro. Therein you will expresse your owne good parts, Boy. Dam. And tye us two, to you, for the gentle office. Pro. Wee are a paire of publique persons (this Gentleman, and my selfe) that are sent, thus coupled unto you upon state-busines. Boy. It concernes but the state of the Stage I hope! Dam. O, you shall know that by degrees, Boy. No man leaps into a busines of state, without fourding first the state of the busines. Pro. Wee are sent unto you, indeed from the people. Boy. The people! which side of the people? Dam. The Venison side, if you know it, Boy. Boy. That's the left side. I had rather they had beene the right. Pro. So they are. Not the Paces, or grounds of your people, that sit in the oblique caves and wedges of your house, your sinfull sixe-penny Mechanicks— Dam. But the better, and braver sort of your people! Plush and Velvet-outsides! that stick your house round like so many eminences— Boy. Of clothes, not understandings? They are at pawne. Well, I take these as a part of your people though; what bring you to me from these people? Dam. You have heard, Boy, the ancient Poëts had it in their purpose, still to please this people. Pro. I, their chiefe aime was— Dam. Populo ut placerent: (if hee understands so much.) Boy. Quas fecissent fabulas.) I understand that, sin' I learn'd Terence, i'the third forme at Westminster: go on Sir. Pro. Now, these people have imployed us to you, in all their names, to intreat an excellent Play from you. Dam. For they have had very meane ones, from this shop of late, the Stage as you call it. Boy. Troth, Gentlemen, I have no wares, which I dare thrust upon the people with praise. But this, such as it is, I will venter with your people, your gay gallant people: so as you, againe, will undertake for them, that they shall know a good Play when they heare it; and will have the conscience, and ingenuity beside, to confesse it. Prob. Wee'll passe our words for that: you shall have a brace of us to ingage ourselves. Boy. You'l tender your names, Gentlemen, to our booke then? Dam. Yes, here's Mr. Probee; A man of most powerfull speech, and parts to perswade. Pro. And Mr. Damplay, will make good all hee undertakes. Boy. Good Mr. Probee, and Mr. Damplay! I like your securities: whence doe you write yourselves? Pro. Of London, Gentlemen: but Knights brothers, and Knights friends, I assure you. Dam. And Knights fellow's too. Every Poët writes Squire now. Boy. You are good names! very good men, both of you! I accept you. Dam. And what is the Title of your Play, here? The Magnetick Lady? Boy. Yes, Sir, an attractive title the Author has given it. Pro. A Magnete, I warrant you. Dam. O, no, from Magnus, Magna, Magnum. Boy. This Gentleman, hath found the true magnitude— Dam. Of his portall, or entry to the worke, according to Vitruvius. Boy. Sir all our worke is done without a Portall—or Vitruvius. In Foro, as a true Comœdy should bee. And what is conceald within, is brought out, and made present by report. Dam. Wee see not that alwayes observ'd, by your Authors of these times: or scarce any other. Boy. Where it is not at all knowne, how should it be observ'd? The most of those your people call Authors, never dreamt of any Decorum, or what was proper in the Scene; but grope at it, i'the darke, and feele, or fumble for it; I speake it, both with their leave, and the leave o' your people. Dam. But, why Humors reconcil'd? I would faine know? Boy. I can satisfie you there, too: if you will. But, perhaps you desire not to be satisfied. Dam. No? why should you conceive so, Boy? Boy. My conceit is not ripe, yet: Ile tell you that anon. The Author, beginning his studies of this kind, with every man in his Humour; and after, every man out of his Humour; and since, continuing in all his Playes, especially those of the Comick thred, whereof the New-Inne was the last, some recent humours still, or manners of men, that went along with the times, finding himselfe now neare the close, or shutting up of his Circle, hath phant'sied to himselfe, in Idæa, this Magnetick Mistris. A Lady a brave bountifull House-keeper, and a vertuous Widow: who having a young Neice, ripe for a man and marriageable, hee makes that his Center attractive, to draw thither a diversity of Guests, all persons of different humours to make up his Perimiter. And this hee hath call'd Humors reconcil'd. Pro. A bold undertaking! and farre greater, then the reconciliation of both Churches, the quarrell betweene humours having beene much the ancienter, and, in my poore opinion, the root of all Schisme, and Faction, both in Church and Common-wealth. Boy. Such is the opinion of many wise men, that meet at this shop still; but how hee will speed in it, wee cannot tell, and hee himselfe (it seems) lesse cares. For hee will not be intreated by us, to give it a Prologue. He has lost too much that way already, hee sayes. Hee will not woo the gentile ignorance so much. But carelesse of all vulgar censure, as not depending on common approbation, hee is confident it shall super-please judicious Spectators, and to them he leaves it to worke, with the rest by example, or otherwise. Dam. Hee may be deceived in that, Boy: Few follow examples now, especially, if they be good. Boy. The Play is ready to begin, Gentlemen, I tell you, lest you might defraud the expectation of the people, for whom you are Delegates! Please you take a couple of Seates, and plant your selves, here, as neere my standing as you can: Fly every thing! (you see) to the marke, and censure it; freely. So, you interrupt not the Series, or thred of the Argument, to breake or pucker it, with unnecessary questions. For, I must tell you, (not out of mine owne Dictamen, but the Authors,) A good Play, is like a skeene of silke: which, if you take by the right end, you may wind off, at pleasure, on the bottome, or card of your discourse, in a tale, or so; how you will: But if you light on the wrong end, you will pull all into a knot, or elfe-lock; which nothing but the sheers, or a candle will undoe, or separate. Dam. Stay! who be these, I pray you? Boy. Because it is your first question, and (these be the prime persons) it would in civility require an answer: but I have heard the Poët affirme, that to be the most unlucky Scene in a Play, which needs an Interpreter; especially, when the Auditory are awake: and such are you, hee presumes. Ergo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. Compasse, Ironside. Com. Welcome good Captaine Ironside, and brother; You shall along with me. I'm lodg'd hard by, Here at a noble Ladies house i'th' street, The Lady Loadstones (one will bid us welcome) Where there are Gentlewomen, and male Guests, Of severall humors, cariage, constitution, Profession too: but so diametrall One to another, and so much oppos'd, As if I can but hold them all together, And draw 'hem to a sufferance of themselves, But till the Dissolution of the Dinner; I shall have just occasion to beleeve My wit is magisteriall; and our selves Take infinite delight, i'the successe. Iro. Troth, brother Compasse, you shall pardon me; I love not so to multiply acquaintance At a meales cost, 'twill take off o' my freedome So much: or bind me to the least observance. Com. Why Ironside, you know I am a Scholler, And part a Souldier; I have beene imployed, By some the greatest States-men o' the kingdome, These many yeares: and in my time convers'd With sundry humors, suiting so my selfe To company, as honest men, and knaves, Good-fellowes, Hypocrites, all sorts of people, Though never so divided in themselves, Have studied to agree still in the usage, And handling of me (which hath beene faire too.) Iro. Sir I confesse you to be one well read In men, and manners; and that, usually, The most ungovern'd persons, you being present, Rather subject themselves unto your censure, Then give you least occasion of distaste, By making you the subject of their mirth: But (to deale plainely with you, as a brother) When ever I distrust i'my owne valour: Ile never beare me on anothers wit, Or offer to bring off, or save my selfe On the opinion of your Iudgement, gravitie, Discretion, or what else. But (being away) You'are sure to have lesse-wit-worke, gentle brother, My humour being as stubborne, as the rest, And as unmannageable. Com. You doe mistake My Caract of your friendship, all this while! Or at what rate I reckon your assistance Knowing by long experience, to such Animals, Halfe-hearted Creatures, as these are, your Foxe, there, Vnkenneld with a Cholerick, ghastly aspect, Or two or three comminatory Termes, Would run their feares to any hole of shelter, Worth a dayes laughter! I am for the sport: For nothing else. Iro. But, brother, I ha' seene A Coward, meeting with a man as valiant As our St. George (not knowing him to be such, Or having least opinion that hee was so) Set to him roundly, I, and swindge him soundly: And i'the vertue of that errour, having Once overcome, resolv'd for ever after To erre; and thinke no person, nor no creature More valiant then himselfe. Com. I thinke that too. But, Brother, (could I over intreat you) I have some little plot upon the rest If you would be contented, to endure A sliding reprehension, at my hands, To heare your selfe, or your profession glanc'd at In a few sleighting termes: It would beget Me such a maine Authority, o' the by: And doe your selfe no dis-repute at all! Iro. Compasse, I know that universall causes In nature produce nothing; but as meeting Particular causes, to determine those, And specifie their acts. This is a piece Of Oxford Science, staies with me ere since I left that place; and I have often found The truth thereof, in my private passions: For I doe never feele my selfe perturb'd With any generall words 'gainst my profession, Vnlesse by some smart stroke upon my selfe They doe awake, and stirre me: Else, to wise And well experienc'd men, words doe but signifie; They have no power; save with dull Grammarians, Whose soules are nought, but a Syntaxis of them. Com. Here comes our Parson, Parson Palate here A venerable youth! I must salute him, And a great Clerke! hee's going to the Ladies, And though you see him thus, without his Cope, I dare assure you, hee's our Parish Pope! God save my reverend Clergy, Parson Palate. Scene II. Palate, Compasse, Ironside. Pal. The witty Mr. Compasse! how is't, with you? Com. My Lady staies for you, and for your Councell, Touching her Neice Mrs. Placentia Steele! Who strikes the fire of full fourteene, to day, Ripe for a husband. Pal. I, she chimes, shee chimes, Saw you the Doctor Rut, the house Physician? He's sent for too. Com. To Councell? 'time yo' were there. Make haste, and give it a round quick dispatch: That wee may goe to dinner betimes, Parson: And drinke a health, or two more, to the busines. Iro. This is a strange put-off! a reverend youth, You use him most surreverently me thinkes! What? call you him? Palate Please? or Parson Palate? Com. All's one, but shorter! I can gi' you his Character. Hee, is the Prelate of the Parish, here; And governes all the Dames; appoints the cheere; Writes downe the bils of fare; pricks all the Guests; Makes all the matches and the marriage feasts Within the ward; drawes all the parish wils; Designes the Legacies; and strokes the Gills Of the chiefe Mourners; And (who ever lacks) Of all the kindred, hee hath first his blacks. Thus holds hee weddings up, and burials, As his maine tithing; with the Gossips stals, Their pewes; He's top still, at the publique messe; Comforts the widow, and the fatherlesse, In funerall Sack! Sits 'bove the Alderman! For of the Ward-mote Quest, he better can, The mysterie, then the Levitick Law: That peece of Clark-ship doth his Vestry awe. Hee is as he conceives himselfe, a fine Well furnish'd, and apparaled Divine. Iro. Who made this Epigramme, you? Com. No, a great Clarke As any'is of his bulke. (Ben: Ionson) made it. Iro. But what's the other Character, Doctor Rut? Com. The same man made 'hem both: but his is shorter, And not in rime, but blancks. Ile tell you that, too. Rut is a young Physician to the family: That, letting God alone, ascribes to nature More then her share; licentious in discourse, And in his life a profest Voluptary; The slave of money, a Buffon in manners; Obscene in language; which he vents for wit; Is sawcy in his Logicks, and disputing, Is any thing but civill, or a man. See here they are! and walking with my Lady, In consultation, afore the doore; Wee will slip in, as if we saw 'hem not. Scene III. Lady, Palate, Rut. Lad. I, tis his fault, she's not bestow'd, My brother Interests. Pal. Who, old Sir Moath? Lad. Hee keeps off all her Suitors, keepes the portion, Still in his hands: and will not part with all, On any termes. Pal. Hinc illæ lachrymæ Thence flowes the cause o' the maine grievance. Rut. That It is a maine one! how much is the portion? Lad. No petty summe. Pal. But sixteene thousand pound. Rut. He should be forc'd, Madam, to lay it downe. When is it payable? Lad. When she is married. Pal. Marry her, marry her, Madam. Rut. Get her married. Loose not a day, an houre— Pal. Not a minute. Pursue your project reall. Mr. Compasse, Advis'd you, too. He is the perfect Instrument, Your Ladiship should saile by. Rut. Now, Mr. Compasse Is a fine witty man; I saw him goe in, now. Lad. Is hee gone in? Pal. Yes, and a Fether with him, He seemes a Souldier. Rut. Some new Sutor, Madam. Lad. I am beholden to him: hee brings ever Variety of good persons to my table, And I must thanke him, though my brother Interest Dislike of it a little. Pal. Hee likes nothing That runs your way. Rut. Troth, and the other cares not. Hee'll goe his owne way, if he thinke it right. Lad. Hee's a true friend! and ther's Mr. Practise, The fine young man of Law comes to the house: My brother brooks him not, because he thinkes He is by me assigned for my Neice: Hee will not heare of it. Rut. Not of that eare: But yet your Ladiship doth wisely in it— Pal. 'Twill make him to lay downe the portion sooner, If he but dreame you'l match her with a Lawyer. Lad. So Mr. Compasse sayes. It is betweene The Lawyer, and the Courtier, which shall have her. Bal. Who, Sir Diaphanous Silke-worme? Rut. A fine Gentle-man. Old Mr. Silke-wormes Heire. Pal. And a neat Courtier, Of a most elegant thred Lad. And so my Gossip Polish assures me. Here she comes! good Polish Welcome in troth! How do'st thou gentle Polish? Rut. Who's this? Pal. Dame Polish, her shee-Parasite, Her talking, soothing, sometime governing Gossip. Scene IV. Polish, Lady, Palate, Rut. Pal. Your Ladiship is still the Lady Loadstone That drawes, and drawes unto you, Guests of all sorts: The Courtiers, and the Souldiers, and the Schollers, The Travellers, Physicians, and Divines, As Doctor Ridley writ, and Doctor Barlow? They both have wrote of you, and Mr. Compasse. Lad. Wee meane, they shall write more, ere it be long. Pol. Alas, they are both dead, and't please you; But, Your Ladiship meanes well, and shall meane well, So long as I live. How does your fine Neice? My charge, Mistris Placentia Steele? Lad. Shee is not well. Pol. Not well? Lad. Her Doctor sayes so. Rut. Not very well; shee cannot shoot at Buts. Or manage a great Horse, but shee can cranch A sack of small coale! eat you lime, and haire, Soap-ashes, Loame, and has a dainty spice O' the greene sicknesse! Pol. 'Od sheild! Rut. Or the Dropsie! A toy, a thing of nothing. But my Lady, here Her noble Aunt. Pol. Shee is a noble Aunt! And a right worshipfull Lady, and a vertuous; I know it well! Rut. Well, if you know it, peace. Pal. Good sister Polish heare your betters speake. Pol. Sir I will speake, with my good Ladies leave, And speake, and speake againe; I did bring up My Ladies Neice, Mrs. Placentia Steele, With my owne Daughter (who's Placentia too) And waits upon my Lady, is her woman: Her Ladiship well knowes Mr s. Placentia Steele (as I said) her curious Neice, was left A Legacie to me; by Father, and Mother With the Nurse, Keepe, that tended her: her Mother Shee died in Child-bed of her, and her Father Liv'd not long after: for he lov'd her Mother! They were a godly couple! yet both di'd, (As wee must all.) No creature is immortall; I have heard our Pastor say: no, not the faithfull! And they did die (as I said) both in one moneth. Rut. Sure shee is not long liv'd, if she spend breath thus. Pol. And did bequeath her, to my care, and hand, To polish, and bring up. I moulded her, And fashion'd her, and form'd her; she had the sweat Both of my browes and braines. My Lady knowes it Since she could write a quarter old. Lad. I know not That she could write so early, my good Gossip. But I doe know she was so long your care, Till she was twelve yeare old; that I call'd for her, And tooke her home, for which I thanke you Polish, And am beholden to you. Rut. I sure thought She had a Lease of talking, for nine lives— Pal. It may be she has. Pol. Sir sixteene thousand pound Was then her portion! for she was, indeed, Their only child! and this was to be paid Vpon her marriage, so she married still With my good Ladies liking here, her Aunt: (I heard the Will read) Mr. Steele her father, The world condemn'd him to be very rich, And very hard, and he did stand condemn'd With that vaine world, till, as 'twas 'prov'd, after, He left almost as much more to good uses In Sir Moath Interests hands, my Ladies brother, Whose sister he had married: He holds all In his close gripe. But Mr. Steele, was liberall, And a fine man; and she a dainty Dame, And a religious, and a bountifull— Scene V. To them. Compasse, Ironside. [Pol.] You knew her Mr. Compasse? Com. Spare the torture, I doe confesse without it. Pol. And her husband, What a fine couple they were? and how they liv'd? Com. Yes. Pol. And lov'd together, like a paire of Turtles? Com. Yes. Pol. And feasted all the Neighbours? Com. Take her off Some body that hath mercy. Rut. O he knowes her, It seemes! Com. Or any measure of compassion: Doctors, if you be Christians, undertake One for the soule, the other for the body! Pol. She would dispute with the Doctors of Divinity At her owne table! and the Spitle Preachers! And find out the Armenians. Rut. The Armenians? Pol. I say the Armenians. Com. Nay, I say so too! Pol. So Mr. Polish calld 'hem, the Armenians! Com. And Medes, and Persians did he not? Pol. Yes, he knew 'hem, And so did Mistris Steele! she was his Pupill! The Armenians, he would say, were worse then Papists! And then the Persians, were our Puritanes, Had the fine piercing wits! Com. And who, the Medes? Pol. The midle men, the Luke-warme Protestants? Rut. Out, out. Pol. Sir she would find them by their branching: Their branching sleeves, brancht cassocks, and brancht doctrine, Beside their Texts. Rut. Stint Karlin: Ile not heare, Confute her Parson. Pol. I respect no Persons, Chaplins, or Doctors, I will speake. Lad. Yes, so't be reason, Let her. Rut. Death, she cannot speake reason. Com. Nor sense, if we be Masters of our senses! Iro. What mad woman ha' they got, here, to bate? Pol. Sir I am mad, in truth, and to the purpose; And cannot but be mad; to heare my Ladies Dead sister sleighted, witty Mrs. Steele! Iro. If shee had a wit, Death has gone neere to spoile it, Assure your selfe. Pol. She was both witty, and zealous, And lighted all the Tinder o' the truth, (As one said) of Religion, in our Parish: Shee was too learn'd to live long with us! She could the Bible in the holy tongue: And reade it without pricks: had all her Masoreth; Knew Burton, and his Bull; and scribe Prin-Gent! Præsto-be-gon: and all the Pharisees. Lad. Deare Gossip, Be you gone, at this time, too, and vouchsafe To see your charge, my Neice. Pol. I shall obey If your wise Ladiship thinke fit: I know, To yeild to my Superiors. Lad. A good woman! But when she is impertinent, growes earnest, A litle troublesome, and out of season: Her love, and zeale transport her. Com. I am glad, That any thing could port her hence. Wee now Have hope of dinner, after her long grace. I have brought your Ladiship a hungry Guest, here, A Souldier, and my brother Captaine Ironside: Who being by custome growne a Sanguinarie, The solemne, and adopted sonne of slaughter: Is more delighted i' the chase of an enemy, An execution of three daies, and nights; Then all the hope of numerous succession, Or happinesse of Issue could bring to him. Rut. Hee is no Suitor then? Pol. So't should seeme. Com. And, if hee can get pardon at heavens hand, For all his murthers, is in as good case As a new christned Infant: (his imployments Continu'd to him, without Interruption; And not allowing him, or time, or place To commit any other sinne, but those) Please you to make him welcome for a meale, Madam. Lad. The noblenesse of his profession makes His welcome perfect: though your course description Would seeme to sully it. Iro. Never, where a beame Of so much favour doth illustrate it, Right knowing Lady. Pal. She hath cur'd all well. Rut. And hee hath fitted well the Complement. Scene VI. To them. Sir Diaphanous. Practise. Com. No; here they come! the prime Magnetick Guests Our Lady Loadstone so respects: the Artick! And th'Antartick! Sir Diaphanous Silke-worme! A Courtier extraordinary; who by diet Of meates, and drinkes; his temperate exercise; Choise musick; frequent bathes; his horary shifts Of Shirts and Wast-coats; meanes to immortalize Mortality it selfe; and makes the essence Of his whole happinesse the trim of Court. Dia. I thanke you Mr. Compasse, for your short Encomiastick. Rut. It is much in little, Sir. Pal. Concise, and quick: the true stile of an Orator. Com. But Mr. Practise here, my Ladies Lawyer! Or man of Law: (for that's the true writing) A man so dedicate to his profession, And the preferments goe along with it; As scarce the thundring bruit of an invasion, Another eighty eight, threatning his Countrey With ruine; would no more worke upon him, Then Syracusa's Sack, on Archimede: So much he loves that Night-cap! the Bench-gowne! With the broad Guard o'th back! These shew A man betroth'd unto the study of our Lawes! Pra. Which you but thinke the crafty impositions, Of subtile Clerks, feats of fine understanding, To abuse Clots, and Clownes with, Mr. Compasse, Having no ground in nature, to sustaine it Or light, from those cleare causes: to the inquiry And search of which, your Mathematicall head, Hath so devow'd it selfe. Com. Tut, all men are Philosophers, to their inches. There's within, Sir Interest, as able a Philosopher, In buying, and selling! has reduc'd his thrifte, To certaine principles, and i'that method! As hee will tell you instantly, by Logarythmes, The utmost profit of a stock imployed: (Be the Commoditie what it will) the place, Or time, but causing very, very little, Or, I may say, no paralaxe at all, In his pecuniary observations! He has brought your Neices portion with him, Madam; At least the man that must receive it; Here They come negotiating the affaire; You may perceive the Contract in their faces; And read th'indenture: If you'ld signe 'hem. So. Scene VII. To them. Interest. Bias. Pal. What is he, Mr. Compasse? Com. A Vi-politique! Or a sub-aiding Instrument of State! A kind of a laborious Secretary To a great man! (and likely to come on) Full of attendance! and of such a stride In busines politique, or œconomick, As, well, his Lord may stoope t'advise with him, And be prescribed by him, in affaires Of highest consequence, when hee is dull'd, Or wearied with the lesse. Dia. 'Tis Mr. Bias, Lord Whach'um's Politique. Com. You know the man? Dia. I ha' seene him waite at Court, there, with his Maniples Of papers, and petitions. Pra. Hee is one That over-rules tho', by his authority Of living there; and cares for no man else: Neglects the sacred letter of the Law; And holds it all to be but a dead heape, Of civill institutions: the rest only Of common men, and their causes, a farragoe, Or a made dish in Court; a thing of nothing: Com. And that's your quarrell at him? a just plea. Int. I tell you sister Loadstone— Com. (Hang your eares This way: and heare his praises, now Moath opens) Int. I ha'brought you here the very man! the Jewell Of all the Court! close Mr. Bias! Sister, Apply him to your side! or you may weare him Here o' your brest! or hang him in your eare! He's a fit Pendant for a Ladies tip! A Chrisolite, a Gemme: the very Agat Of State, and Politie: cut from the Quar Of Macchiavel, a true Cornelian, As Tacitus himselfe! and to be made The brooch to any true State-cap in Europe! Lad. You praise him brother, as you had hope to sell him. Com. No Madam, as hee had hope to sell your Neice Vnto him. Lad. 'Ware your true jests, Mr. Compasse; They will not relish. Int. I will tell you, sister, I cannot cry his Carract up enough: He is unvaluable: All the Lords Have him in that esteeme, for his relations, Corrant's, Avises, Correspondences With this Ambassadour, and that Agent! Hee Will screw you out a Secret from a Statist—. Com. So easie, as some Cobler wormes a Dog. Int. And lock it in the Cabinet of his memory—. Com. Till 't turne a politique insect, or a Fly! Thus long. Int. You may be merry Mr. Compasse, But though you have the reversion of an office, You are not in't Sir. Bia. Remember that. Com. Why, should that fright me, Mr. Bi?, from telling Whose as you are? Int. Sir he's one, can doe His turnes there: and deliver too his letters, As punctually, and in as good a fashion, As ere a Secretary can in Court. Iro. Why, is it any matter in what fashion A man deliver his letters, so he not open 'hem? Bia. Yes, we have certaine precedents in Court, From which wee never swerve, once in an age: And (whatsoere he thinkes) I know the Arts, And Sciences doe not directlier make A Graduate in our Vniversities; Then an habituall gravitie prefers A man in Court. Com. Which by truer stile, Some call a formall, flat servility. Bia. Sir you may call it what you please. But wee (That tread the path of publike businesses) Know what a tacit shrug is, or a shrinke; The wearing the Callott; the politique hood: And twenty other parerga, o' the by, You Seculars understand not: I shall trick him, If his reversion came, i' my Lords way. Dia. What is that Mr. Practise? you sure know? Mas' Compasses reversion? Pra. A fine place (Surveyor of the Projects generall) I would I had it. Pal. What is't worth? Pra. O Sir, A Nemo scit. Lad. Wee'l thinke on't afore dinner. Chorus. Boy. Now, Gentlemen, what censure you of our Protasis, or first Act? Pro. Well, Boy, it is a faire Presentment of your Actors. And a handsome promise of somewhat to come hereafter. Dam. But, there is nothing done in it, or concluded: Therefore I say, no Act. Boy. A fine peice of Logick! Doe you looke, Mr. Damplay, for conclusions in a Protesis? I thought the Law of Comedy had reserv'd to the Catastrophe: and that the Epitasis, (as wee are taught) and the Catastasis, had beene interveening parts, to have beene expected. But you would have all come together it seemes: The Clock should strike five, at once, with the Acts. Dam. Why, if it could doe so, it were well, Boy. Boy. Yes, if the nature of a Clock were to speake, not strike, So, if a Child could be borne, in a Play, and grow up to a man, i'the first Scene, before hee went off the Stage: and then after to come forth a Squire, and bee made a Knight: and that Knight to travell betweene the Acts, and doe wonders i'the holy land or else where; kill Paynims wild Boores, dun Cowes, and other Monsters; beget him a reputation, and marry an Emperours Daughter: for his Mrs. Convert her Fathers Countrey; and at last come home, lame and all to be laden with miracles. Dam. These miracles would please, I assure you: and take the People! For there be of the People, that will expect miracles, and more then miracles from this Pen. Boy. Doe they thinke this Pen can juggle? I would we had Hokos-pokos for 'hem then; your People, or Travitanto Tudesko. Dam. Who's that Boy? Boy. Another Juggler, with a long name. Or that your expectors would be gone hence, now, at the first Act; or expect no more hereafter, then they understand. Dam. Why so my peremptory Jack? Boy. My name is Iohn, indeed—Because, who expect what is impossible, or beyond nature, defraud themselves. Pro. Nay, there the Boy said well: They doe defraud themselves indeed. Boy. And therefore, Mr. Damplay, unlesse like a solemne Justice of wit, you will damne our Play, unheard, or unexamin'd; I shall intreat your Mrs. Madam Expectation, if shee be among these Ladies, to have patience, but a pissing while: give our Springs leave to open a little, by degrees: A Source of ridiculous matter may breake forth anon, that shall steepe their temples, and bathe their braines in laughter, to the fomenting of Stupiditie it selfe, and the awaking any velvet Lethargy in the House. Pro. Why doe you maintaine your Poets quarrell so with velvet, and good clothes, Boy? wee have seene him in indifferent good clothes, ere now. Boy. And may doe in better, if it please the King (his Master) to say Amen to it, and allow it, to whom hee acknowledgeth all. But his clothes shall never be the best thing about him, though; hee will have somewhat beside, either of humane letters, or severe honesty, shall speak him a man though he went naked. Pro. Hee is beholden to you, if you can make this good, Boy. Boy. Himselfe hath done that, already, against Envy. Dam. What's your name Sir? or your Countrey? Boy. Iohn Try-gust my name: A Cornish youth, and the Poëts Servant. Dam. West-countrey breed, I thought, you were so bold. Boy. Or rather sawcy: to find out your palate, Mr. Damplay, Faith we doe call a Spade, a Spade, in Cornewall. If you dare damne our Play, i'the wrong place, we shall take heart to tell you so. Pro. Good Boy.</field>

O blessed man! the bravery prick't out, To make my dainty charge, a Vi-countesse! And my good Lady, her Aunt, Countesse at large! Scene IIII. To them. Diaphanous. Palate. Dia. I tell thee Parson, if I get her, reckon Thou hast a friend in Court; and shalt command A thousand pound, to goe on any errand, For any Church preferment thou hast a mind too. Pal. I thanke your worship: I will so worke for you, As you shall study all the wayes to thanke me: Ile worke my Lady, and my Ladies friends; Her Gossip, and this Doctor; and Squire Needle, And Mr. Compasse, who is all in all: The very Fly shee moves by: Hee is one That went to Sea with her husband, Sir Iohn Loadstone, And brought home the rich prizes: all that wealth Is left her; for which service she respects him: A dainty Scholler in the Mathematicks; And one shee wholly imployes. Now Dominus Practise Is yet the man (appointed by her Ladiship) But there's a trick to set his cap awry: If I know any thing; hee hath confest To me in private, that hee loves another, My Ladies woman, Mrs. Pleasance: therefore Secure you of Rivalship. Dia. I thanke thee My noble Parson: There's five hundred pound Waites on thee more for that. Pal. Accoast the Neice: Yonder shee walkes alone: Ile move the Aunt: But here's the Gossip: shee expects a morsell. Ha' you nere a Ring, or toy to throw away? Dia. Yes, here's a Diamont of some threescore pound, I pray you give her that. Pal. If shee will take it. Dia. And there's an Emerauld, for the Doctor too: Thou Parson, thou shalt coine me: I am thine. Pal. Here Mr. Compasse comes: Doe you see my Lady? And all the rest? how they doe flutter about him! Hee is the Oracle of the house, and family! Now, is your time: goe nick it with the Neice: I will walke by; and hearken how the Chimes goe. Scene V. To them; Compasse. Com. Nay Parson, stand not off; you may approach; This is no such hid point of State, wee handle, But you may heare it: for wee are all of Counsell. The gentle Mr. Practise, hath dealt clearly, And nobly with you, Madam. Lad. Ha' you talk'd with him? And made the overture? Com. Yes, first I mov'd The busines trusted to me, by your Ladiship, I' your owne words, almost your very Sillabes: Save where my Memory trespass'd 'gainst their elegance: For which I hope your pardon. Then I inlarg'd In my owne homely stile, the speciall goodnesse, And greatnesse, of your bounty, in your choice, And free conferring of a benefit, So without ends, conditions, any tye But his meere vertue, and the value of it, To call him to your kindred, to your veines, Insert him in your family, and to make him A Nephew, by the offer of a Neice, With such a portion; which when hee had heard, And most maturely acknowledg'd (as his calling Tends all unto maturity) he return'd A thankes, as ample as the Curtesie, (In my opinion) said it was a Grace, Too great to be rejected, or accepted By him! But as the termes stood with his fortune, Hee was not to prevaricate, with your Ladiship, But rather to require ingenious leave, He might with the same love, that it was offer'd Refuse it, since he could not with his honesty, (Being he was ingag'd before) receive it. Pal. The same he said to me. Com. And name the party. Pal. He did, and he did not. Com. Come, leave your Schemes, And fine Amphibolies, Parson. Pal. You'l heare more. Pol. Why, now your Ladiship is free to choose, The Courtier Sir Diaphanous: he shall doe it, Ile move it to him my selfe. Lad. What will you move to him? Pol. The making you a Countesse. Lad. Stint, fond woman. Know you the partie Mr. Practise meanes? To Compasse. Com. No, but your Parson sayes he knowes, Madam. Lad. I feare he fables; Parson doe you know Where Mr. Practise is ingag'd? Pal. Ile tell you! But under seale, her Mother must not know: 'T is with your Ladiships woman, Mrs. Pleasance. Com. How! Lad. Hee is not mad. Pal. O hide the hideous secret From her, shee'l trouble all else. You doe hold A Cricket by the wing. Com. Did he name Pleasance? Are you sure Parson? Lad. O' tis true, your Mrs! I find where your shooe wrings you, Mr. Compasse: But, you'l looke to him there. Com. Yes, here's Sir Moath, Your brother, with his Bias, and the Partie Deepe in discourse: 'twill be a bargaine, and sale; I see by their close working of their heads, And running them together so in Councell. Lad. Will Mr. Practise be of Councell against us? Com. He is a Lawyer, and must speake for his Fee, Against his Father, and Mother, all his kindred; His brothers, or his sisters: no exception Lies at the Common-Law. He must not alter Nature for forme, but goe on in his path It may be he will be for us. Doe not you Offer to meddle, let them take their course: Dispatch, and marry her off to any husband; Be not you scrupulous; let who can have her: So he lay downe the portion, though he gueld it: It will maintaine the suit against him: somewhat, Something in hand is better, then no birds. He shall at last accompt, for the utmost farthing, If you can keepe your hand from a discharge. Pol. Sir, doe but make her worshipfull Aunt a Countesse, And she is yours: her Aunt has worlds to leave you! The wealth of six East Indian Fleets at least! Her Husband, Sir Iohn Loadstone, was the Governour O' the Company seven yeares. Dia. And came there home, Six Fleets in seven yeares. Pol. I cannot tell, I must attend my Gossip, her good Ladiship. Pla. And will you make me a Vi-countesse too? For, How doe they make a Countesse? in a Chaire? Or 'pon a bed? Dia. Both wayes, sweet bird, Ile shew you. Scene VI. Interest. Practise. Bias. Compasse. Palate. Rut. Ironside. To them. Int. The truth is, Mr. Practise, now wee are sure That you are off, we dare come on the bolder: The portion left, was sixteene thousand pound, I doe confesse it, as a just man should. And call here Mr. Compasse, with these Gentlemen, To the relation: I will still be just. Now for the profits every way arising, It was the Donors wisedome, those should pay Me for my watch, and breaking of my sleepes; It is no petty charge, you know, that summe; To keepe a man awake, for fourteene yeare. Pra. But (as you knew to use it i' that time) It would reward your waking. Int. That's my industry; As it might be your reading, studie, and counsell; And now your pleading, who denies it you? I have my calling too. Well, Sir, the Contract Is with this Gentleman, ten thousand pound. (An ample portion, for a younger brother, With a soft, tender, delicate rib of mans flesh, That he may worke like waxe, and print upon.) He expects no more then that summe to be tendred, And hee receive it: Those are the conditions. Pra. A direct bargaine, and sale in open market. Int. And what I have furnish'd him with all o' the by, To appeare, or so: A matter of foure hundred, To be deduc'd upo' the payment—. Bia. Right. You deale like a just man still. Int. Draw up this Good Mr. Practise, for us, and be speedy. Pra. But here's a mighty gaine Sir, you have made Of this one stock! the principall first doubled, In the first seven yeare; and that redoubled I'the next seven! beside sixe thousand pound, There's threescore thousand got in fourteene yeare, After the usuall rate of ten i' the hundred, And the ten thousand paid. Int. I thinke it be! Pra. How will you scape the clamour, and the envie? Int. Let 'hem exclaime, and envie: what care I? Their murmurs raise no blisters i' my flesh. My monies are my blood, my parents, kindred: And he that loves not those, he is unnaturall: I am perswaded that the love of monie Is not a vertue, only in a Subject, But might befit a Prince. And (were there need) I find me able to make good the Assertion. To any reasonable mans understanding. And make him to confesse it. Com. Gentlemen, Doctors, and Schollers, yo'll heare this, and looke for As much true secular wit, and deepe Lay-sense, As can be showne on such a common place. Int. First, wee all know the soule of man is infinite I' what it covers. Who desireth knowledge, Desires it infinitely. Who covers honour, Covets it infinitely. It will be then No hard thing, for a coveting man, to prove Or to confesse, hee aimes at infinite wealth. Com. His soule lying that way. Int. Next, every man Is i'the hope, or possibility Of a whole world: this present world being nothing, But the dispersed issue of first one: And therefore I not see, but a just man May with just reason, and in office ought Propound unto himselfe. Com. An infinite wealth! Ile beare the burden: Goe you on Sir Moath. Int. Thirdly, if wee consider man a member, But of the body politique, we know, By just experience, that the Prince hath need More of one wealthy, then ten fighting men. Com. There you went out o' the road, a little from us. Int. And therefore, if the Princes aimes be infinite, It must be in that, which makes all. Com. Infinite wealth. Int. Fourthly, 'tis naturall to all good subjects, To set a price on money; more then fooles Ought on their Mrs. Picture; every piece Fro' the penny to the twelve pence, being the Hieroglyphick, And sacred Sculpture of the Soveraigne. Com. A manifest conclusion, and a safe one. Int. Fiftly, wealth gives a man the leading voice, At all conventions; and displaceth worth, With generall allowance to all parties: It makes a trade to take the wall of vertue; And the mere issue of a shop, right Honourable. Sixtly, it doth inable him that hath it To the performance of all reall actions, Referring him to himselfe still: and not binding His will to any circumstance, without him; It gives him precise knowledge of himselfe; For, be he rich, he straight with evidence knowes Whether he have any compassion, Or inclination unto vertue, or no; Where the poore knave erroniously beleeves, If he were rich, he would build Churches, or Doe such mad things. Seventhly, your wise poore men Have ever beene contented to observe Rich Fooles, and so to serve their turnes upon them: Subjecting all their wit to the others wealth. And become Gentlemen Parasites, Squire Bauds, To feed their Patrons honorable humors. Eightly, 'tis certaine that a man may leave His wealth, or to his Children, or his friends; His wit hee cannot so dispose, by Legacie? As they shall be a Harrington the better for't. Com. He may intaile a Jest upon his house, though: Enter Ironside. Or leave a tale to his posteritie, To be told after him. Iro. As you have done here? T'invite your friend, and brother to a feast, Where all the Guests are so mere heterogene, And strangers, no man knowes another, or cares If they be Christians, or Mahumetans! That here are met. Com. Is't any thing to you brother, To know Religions more then those you fight for? Iro. Yes, and with whom I eat. I may dispute, And how shall I hold argument with such, I neither know their humors, nor their heresies; Which are religions now, and so receiv'd? Here's no man among these that keepes a servant, To inquire his Master of: yet i' the house, I heare it buzz'd, there are a brace of Doctors; A Foole, and a Physician: with a Courtier, That feeds on mulbery leaves, like a true Silkeworme: A Lawyer, and a mighty Money-Baud, Sir Moath! has brought his politique Bias with him: A man of a most animadverting humor: Who, to indeare himselfe unto his his Lord, Will tell him, you and I, or any of us, That here are met, are all pernitious spirits, And men of pestilent purpose, meanely affected Vnto the State wee live in: and beget Himselfe a thankes, with the great men o' the time, By breeding Jealouses in them of us, Shall crosse our fortunes, frustrate our endeavours, Twice seven yeares after: And this trick be call'd Cutting of throats, with a whispering, or a pen-knife. I must cut his throat now: I'am bound in honour, And by the Law of armes, to see it done; I dare to doe it; and I dare professe The doing of it: being to such a Raskall, Who is the common offence growne of man-kind; And worthy to be torne up from society. Com. You shall not doe it here, Sir. Iro. Why? will you Intreat your selfe, into a beating for him, My courteous brother? If you will, have at you, No man deserves it better (now I thinke on't) Then you: that will keepe consort with such Fidlers, Pragmatick Flies, Fooles, Publicanes, and Moathes: And leave your honest, and adopted brother. Int. 'Best raise the house upon him, to secure us; Hee'll kill us all! Pal. I love no blades in belts. Rut. Nor I. Bia. Would I were at my shop againe, In Court, safe stow'd up, with my politique bundels. Com. How they are scatter'd! Iro. Run away like Cimici, Into the cranies of a rotten bed-stead. Com. I told you such a passage would disperse 'hem, Although the house were their Fee-simple in Law, And they possest of all the blessings in it. Iro. Pray heaven they be not frighted from their stomacks: That so my Ladies Table be disfurnish'd Of the provisions! Com. No, the Parsons calling By this time, all the covey againe, together. Here comes good tydings! Dinners o' the boord. Scene VII. Compasse. Pleasance. Com. Stay Mrs. Pleasance, I must aske you a question: Ha' you any suites in Law? Ple. I, Mr. Compasse? Com. Answer me briefly, it is dinner time. They say you have retain'd brisk Mr. Practise Here, of your Councell; and are to be joyn'd A Patentee with him. Ple. In what? who sayes so? You are dispos'd to jest. Com. No, I am in earnest. It is given out i' the house so, I assure you; But keepe your right to your selfe, and not acquaint A common Lawyer with your case. If hee Once find the gap; a thousand will leape after. Ile tell you more anone. Ple. This Riddle shewes A little like a Love-trick, o' one face, If I could understand it. I will studie it. Chorus. Dam. But whom doth your Poët meane now by this—Mr. Bias? what Lords Secretary, doth hee purpose to personate, or perstringe? Boy. You might as well aske mee, what Alderman, or Aldermans Mate, hee meant by Sir Moath Interest? or what eminent Lawyer, by the ridiculous Mr. Practise? who hath rather his name invented for laughter, then any offence, or injury it can stick on the reverend Professors of the Law: And so the wise ones will thinke. Pro. It is an insidious Question, Brother Damplay! Iniquity it selfe would not have urg'd it. It is picking the Lock of the Scene; nor opening it the faire way with a Key. A Play, though it apparell, and present vices in generall, flies from all particularities in persons. Would you aske of Plantus, and Terence, (if they both liv'd now, who were Davus, or Pseudolus in the Scene? who Pyrgopolinices, or Thraso? who Euclio or Menedemus? Boy. Yes, he would: And inquire of Martial,or any other Epigrammatist, whom he meant by Titius, or Seius (the common John à Noke, or Iohn à Style) under whom they note all vices, and errors taxable to the Times? As if there could not bee a name for a Folly fitted to the Stage, but there must be a person in nature, found out to owne it. Dam. Why, I can phant'sie a person to my selfe Boy, who shall hinder me? Boy. And, in not publishing him, you doe no man an injury. But if you will utter your owne ill meaning on that person, under the Authors words, you make a Libell of his Comœdy. Dam. O, hee told us that in a Prologue, long since. Boy. If you doe the same reprehensible ill things, still the same reprehension will serve you, though you heard it afore: They are his owne words. I can invent no better, nor he. Pro. It is the solemne vice of interpretation, that deformes the figure of many a faire Scene, by drawing it awry; and indeed is the civill murder of most good Playes: If I see a thing vively presented on the Stage, that the Glasse of custome (which is Comedy) is so held up to me, by the Poet, as I can therein view the daily examples of mens lives, and images of Truth, in their manners, so drawne for my delight, or profit, as I may (either way) use them: and will I, rather (then make that true use) hunt out the Persons to defame, by my malice of misapplying? and imperill the innocence, and candor of the Author, by his calumnie? It is an unjust way of hearing, and beholding Playes, this, and most unbecomming a Gentleman to appeare malignantly witty in anothers Worke. Boy. They are no other but narrow, and shrunke natures, shriveld up, poore things, that cannot thinke well of themselves, who dare to detract others. That Signature is upon them, and it will last. A halfe-witted Barbarisme! which no Barbers art, or his bals, will ever expunge or take out. Dam. Why, Boy? This were a strange Empire, or rather a Tyrannie, you would entitle your Poet to, over Gentlemen, that they should come to heare, and see Playes, and say nothing for their money. Boy. O, yes; say what you will: so it be to purpose, and in place. Dam. Can any thing be out of purpose at a Play? I see no reason, if I come here, and give my eighteene pence, or two shillings for my Seat, but I should take it out in censure, on the Stage. Boy. Your two shilling worth is allow'd you: but you will take your ten, shilling worth, your twenty shilling worth, and more: And teach others (about you) to doe the like, that follow your leading face; as if you were to cry up or downe every Scene, by confederacy, be it right or wrong. Dam. Who should teach us the right, or wrong at a Play? Boy. If your owne science can not doe it, or the love of Modesty, and Truth; all other intreaties, or attempts—are vaine. You are fitter Spectators for the Beares, then us, or the Puppets. This is a popular ignorance indeed, somewhat better appareld in you, then the People: but a hard handed, and stiffe ignorance, worthy a Trewel, or a Hammer-man, and not onely fit to be scorn'd, but to be triumph'd ore. Dam. By whom, Boy? Boy. No particular, but the generall neglect, and silence. Good Master Damplay, be your selfe still, without a second: Few here are of your opinion to day, I hope; to morrow, I am sure there will bee none, when they have ruminated this. Pro. Let us mind what you come for, the Play, which will draw on to the Epitasis now.</field>

But they are piec'd, and put together againe, You may goe in, you'l find them at high eating: The Parson has an edifying stomack, And a perswading Palate (like his name:) Hee hath begun three draughts of sack in Doctrines, And fower in Uses. Ite. And they follow him. Nee. No, Sir Diaphanous is a Recusant In sack. He onely takes it in French wine, With an allay of water. In, in Item, And leave your peeping. Kee.

He has discredited my house, and boord, With his rude swaggering manners, and endanger'd My Neices health (by drawing of his weapon) God knowes how farre; for Mr. Doctor does not. Com. The Doctor is an Asse then, if hee say so, And cannot with his conjuring names, Hippocrates; Galen or Rasis, Avicen. Averroes, Cure a poore wenches falling in a swoune: Which a poore Farthing chang'd in Rosa solis, Or Cynnamon water would. Lad. How now? how does she? Kee. Shee's somewhat better.

Helpe me to my Chamber, Nurse Keepe: Would I could see the day no more, But night hung over me, like some darke cloud; That, buried with this losse of my good name, I, and my house might perish, thus forgotten— Com. Her taking it to heart thus, more afflicts me Then all these accidents, for they'll blow over. Scene III. Practise. Silkworme, Compasse. Pra. It was a barbarous Injury, I confesse: But if you will be counsell'd, Sir, by me, The reverend Law lies open to repaire Your reputation. That will gi' you damages; Five thousand pound for a finger, I have knowne Given in Court: And let me pack your Jury. Silk. There's nothing vexes me, but that he has staind My new white sattin Doublet; and bespatter'd My spick and span silke Stockings, o' the day They were drawne on: And here's a spot i' my hose too. Com. Shrewd maimes! your Clothes are wounded desperately, And that (I thinke) troubles a Courtier more, An exact Courtier, then a gash in his flesh. Silk. My flesh? I sweare had he giv'n me twice so much, I never should ha' reckon'd it. But my clothes To be de defac'd, and stigmatiz'd so foulely! I take it as a contumely done me Above the wisedome of our Lawes to right. Com. Why then you'l challenge him? Silk. I will advise, Though Mr. Practise here doth urge the Law; And reputation it will make me of credit, Beside great damages (let him pack my Jury.) Com. He speakes like Mr. Practise, one, that is The Child of a Profession he's vow'd too, And servant to the studie he hath taken, A pure Apprentice at Law! But you must have The Counsell o' the Sword; and square your action Vnto their Cannons, and that brother-hood, If you doe right. Pra. I tell you Mr. Compasse, You speake not like a friend unto the Lawes, Nor scarce a subject, to perswade him thus, Vnto the breach o' the peace: Sir you forget There is a Court above, o' the Starre-Chamber, To punish Routs and Riots. Com. No, young Master, Although your name be Practise there in Terme time, I doe remember it. But you'l not heare What I was bound to say; but like a wild Young haggard Justice, fly at breach o' the Peace, Before you know, whether the amorous Knight Dares break the peace of conscience in a Duell. Silk. Troth Mr. Compasse, I take you my friend; You shall appoint of me in any matter That's reasonable, so wee may meet faire, On even termes. Com. I shall perswade no other, (And take your learned Counsell to advise you) Ile run along with him. You say you'l meet him, On even termes. I doe not see indeed How that can be, 'twixt Ironside and you, Now I consider it. Hee is my brother. I doe confesse (wee ha' call'd so twenty yeare:) But you are, Sir, a Knight in Court, allied there, And so befriended, you may easily answer The worst successe: He a knowne, noted, bold Boy o' the Sword, hath all mens eyes upon him; And there's no London-Iury, but are led In evidence, as farre by common fame, As they are by present deposition. Then you have many brethren, and neer kinsmen. If he kill you, it will be a lasting Quarrell T'wixt them, and him. Whereas Rud: Ironside, Although he ha' got his head into a Beaver, With a huge feather, 's but a Corriers sonne, And has not two old Cordov'an skins, to leave In Leather Caps to mourne him in, if he die. Againe, you are generally belov'd, he hated So much, that all the hearts, and votes of men Goe with you, in the wishing all prosperity Vnto your purpose; hee's a fat, corpulent, Vnweildy fellow: you, a dieted Sparke, Fit for the Combat. He has kild so many; As it is ten to one his turne is next; You never fought with any, lesse, slew any: And therefore have the hopes before you. I hope these things thus specified unto you, Are faire advantages: you cannot encounter Him upon equall termes. Beside, Sir Silkworme, He hath done you wrong in a most high degree: And sense of such an Injury receiv'd, Should so exacuate, and whet your choller, As you should count your selfe an host of men, Compar'd to him. And therefore you, brave Sir, Have no more reason to provoke, or challenge Him, then the huge great Porter has to try His strength upon an Infant. Silke. Mr. Compasse, You rather spur me on, then any way Abate my courage to the Enterprise. Com. All Counsell's as it's taken. If you stand On point of honour, not t'have any odds, I have rather then disswaded you, then otherwise: If upon termes of humour and revenge, I have encourag'd you. So that I thinke, I have done the part of a friend on either side: In furnishing your feare with matter first, If you have any: Or, if you dare fight, To heighten, and confirme your resolution. Pra. I now doe crave your pardon, Mr. Compasse: I did not apprehend your way before, The true Perimiter of it: you have Circles, And such fine draughts about! Silke. Sir I doe thanke you, I thanke you Mr. Compasse heartily; I must confesse, I never fought before, And I'll be glad to doe things orderly, In the right place: I pray you instruct me. Is't best I fight ambitiously, or malitiously? Com. Sir, if you never fought before, be wary, Trust not your selfe too much. Silke. Why? I assure you, I'am very angry. Com. Doe not suffer, though, The flatuous, windy choller of your heart, To move the clapper of your understanding, Which is the guiding faculty, your reason: You know not, if you'l fight, or no, being brought Vpo' the place. Silke. O yes, I have imagin'd Him treble arm'd, provok'd too, and as furious As Homer makes Achilles; and I find My selfe not frighted with his fame one jot. Com. Well, yet take heed. These fights imaginary, Are lesse then skirmishes, the fight of shadowes: For shadowes have their figure, motion And their umbratile action from the reall. Posture, and motion of the bodies act: Whereas (imaginarily) many times, Those men may fight, dare scarce eye one another, And much lesse meet. But if there be no helpe, Faith I would wish you, send him a faire Challenge. Silk. I will goe pen it presently. Com. But word it In them ost generous termes. Silk. Let me alone. Pra. And silken phrase: the courtliest kind of Quarrell. Com. He'l make it a petition for his peace. Pra. O, yes, of right, and hee may doe it by Law. Scene IV. Rut. Palate. Bias, bringing out Interest in a Chaire. Item. Polish following. Rut. Come, bring him out into the aire a little: There set him downe. Bow him, yet bow him more, Dash that same Glasse of water in his face: Now tweak him by the nose. Hard, harder yet: If it but call the blood up from the heart, I aske no more. See, what a feare can doe! Pinch him in the nape of the neck now, nip him, nip him. Ite. He feeles, there's life in him. Pal. He graones, and stirres. Rut. Tell him the Captaine's gone. Int. Ha! Pal. He's gone Sir. Rut. Gi' him a box, hard, hard, on his left eare. Int. O! Rut. How doe you feele your selfe? Int. Sore, sore. Rut. But where? Int. I'my neck. Rut. I nipt him there. Int. And i' my head. Rut. I box'd him twice, or thrice, to move those Sinewes. Bia. I sweare you did. Pol. What a brave man's a Doctor, To beat one into health! I thought his blowes Would eene ha' kild him: hee did feele no more Then a great horse. Int. Is the wild Captaine gone? That man of murther? Bia. All is calme and quiet. Int. Say you so, Cosen Bias? Then all's well. Pal. How quickly a man is lost! Bia. And soone recover'd! Pol. Where there are meanes, and Doctors, learned men, And their Apothecaries, who are not now, (As Chawcer sayes) their friendship to begin. Well, could they teach each other how to win I' their swath bands—. Rut. Leave your Poetry good Gossip. Your Chawcers clouts, and wash your dishes with 'hem, Wee must rub up the roots of his disease, And crave your peace awhile, or else your absence. Pol. Nay, I know when to hold my peace. Rut. Then do it. Gi' me your hand Sir Moath. Let's feele your pulse. It is a Pursinesse, a kind of Stoppage, Or tumor o' the Purse, for want of exercise, That you are troubled with: some ligatures I'th neck of your Vesica, or Marsupium, Are so close knit, that you cannot evaporate; And therefore you must use relaxatives. Beside, they say, you are so restive growne, You cannot but with trouble put your hand Into your pocket, to discharge a reckoning. And this we sonnes of Physick doe call chiragra, A kind of Crampe, or Hand-Gout. You shall purge for't. Ite. Indeed your worship should doe well to advise him, To clense his body, all the three high wayes; That is, by Sweat, Purge, and Phlebotomy. Rut. You say well learned Tim, Ile first prescribe him, To give his purse a purge once, twice a weeke At Dice, or Cards: And when the weather is open, Sweat at a bowling Alley, or be let blood I' the lending veine, and bleed a matter of fifty, Or threescore ounces at a time. Then put Your thumbs under your Girdle, and have somebody Else, pull out your purse for you, till with more ease, And a good habit, you can doe it your selfe. And then be sure alwayes to keepe good diet; And h' your table furnish'd from one end, Vnto the tother: It is good for the eyes, But feed you on one dish still, ha' your Diet-drinke, Ever in Bottles ready, which must come From the Kings-head: I will prescribe you nothing, But what Ile take before you mine owne selfe: That is my course with all my Patients. Pal. Very methodicall, Secundum Artem. Bia. And very safe pro captu recipientis. Pol. All errant learned men, how they spute Latine! Rut. I had it of a Jew, and a great Rabbi, Who every morning cast his cup of White-wine With sugar, and by the residence i' the bottome, Would make report of any Chronick malady, Such as Sir Moath's is, being an oppilation, In that you call the neck o' the money bladder, Most anatomicall, and by dissection. Enter Nurse. Kee. O Mr. Doctor, and his Pothecary! Good Mr. Item, and my Mistris Polish! Wee need you all above! Shee's falne againe, In a worse fit then ever. Pol. Who? Kee. Your charge. Pol. Come away Gentlemen. Int. This fit with the Doctor, Hath mended me past expectation. Scene V. Compasse. Diaphanous. Practise. Bias. Ironside. Com. O Sir Diaphanous, ha' yon done? Dia. I ha' brought it. Pra. That's well. Com. But who shall carry it now? Dia. A friend: Ile find a friend to carry it; Mr. Bias here. Will not deny me that. Bia. What is't? Dia. To carry. A Challenge I have writ unto the Captaine. Bias. Faith but I will Sir, you shall pardon me. For a twi-reason of State. Ile beare no Challenges; I will not hazard my Lords favour so; Or forfeit mine owne Judgement with his honour, To turne a Ruffian: I have to commend me Nought but his Lordships good opinion; And to't my Kallygraphy, a faire hand, Fit for a Secretary: Now you know, a mans hand Being his executing part in fight, Is more obnoxious to the common perill— Dia. You shall not fight Sir, you shall onely search My Antagonist; commit us fairely there Vpo' the ground on equall termes. Bia. O Sir! But if my Lord should heare I stood at end Of any quarrell, 'twere an end of me In a state course! I ha' read the Politiques; And heard th'opinions of our best Divines. Com. The Gentleman has reason! Where was first The birth of your acquaintance? or the Cradle Of your strickt friendship made? Dia. We met in France, Sir. Com. In France! that Garden of humanity, The very seed-plot of all courtesies: I wonder that your friendship suck'd that aliment, The milke of France; and see this sower effect It doth produce, 'gainst all the sweets of travell: There, every Gentleman professing armes, Thinkes he is bound in honour to imbrace The bearing of a Challenge for another, Without or questioning the cause, or asking Least colour of a reason. There's no Cowardize, No Poultrounerie, like urging why? wherefore? But carry a Challenge, die, and doe the thing. Bia. Why, heare you Mr. Compasse, I but crave Your eare in private? I would carry his Challenge, If I but hop'd your Captaine angry enough To kill him: For (to tell you truth) this Knight, Is an impertinent in Court, (wee thinke him:) And troubles my Lords Lodgings, and his Table With frequent, and unnecessary visits, Which wee (the better sort of Servants) like not: Being his Fellowes in all other places, But at our Masters boord; and we disdaine To doe those servile offices, oft times, His foolish pride, and Empire will exact, Against the heart, or humour of a Gentleman. Com. Truth Mr. Bias, I'ld not ha' you thinke I speake to flatter you: but you are one O' the deepest Politiques I ever met, And the most subtily rationall. I admire you. But doe not you conceive in such a case, That you are accessary to his death, From whom you carry a Challenge with such purpose. Bia. Sir the corruption of one thing in nature, Is held the Generation of another; And therefore, I had as leive be accessory Vnto his death, as to his life. Com. A new Morall Philosophy too! you'l carry't then. Bia. If I were sure, 't would not incense his choller To beat the Messenger. Com. O' Ile secure you, You shall deliver it in my lodging; safely, And doe your friend a service worthy thankes. Bia. Ile venture it, upon so good Induction, To rid the Court of an Impediment, This baggage Knight. Iro. Peace to you all Gentlemen, Enter Ironside. Save to this Mushrome; who I heare is menacing Me with a Challenge: which I come to anticipate, And save the Law a labour: Will you fight Sir? Dia. Yes, in my shirt. Iro. O, that's to save your doublet; I know it a Court trick! you had rather have An Vlcer in your body, then a Pinke More i' your clothes. Dia. Captaine, you are a Coward, If you not fight i' your shirt. Iro. Sir I not meane To put it off for that, nor yet my doublet: Yo' have cause to call me Coward, that more feare The stroke of the common, and life giving aire, Then all your fury, and the Panoplie. Pra. (Which is at best, but a thin linnen armour.) I thinke a cup of generous wine were better, Then fighting i' your shirts. Dia. Sir, Sir, my valour, It is a valour of another nature, Then to be mended by a cup of wine. Com. I should be glad to heare of any valours, Differing in kind; who have knowne hitherto, Only one vertue, they call Fortitude, Worthy the name of valour. Iro. Which, who hath not, Is justly thought a Coward: And he is such. Dia. O, you ha' read the Play there, the New Inne, Of Ionsons, that decries all other valour But what is for the publike. Iro. I doe that too, But did not learne it there; I thinke no valour Lies for a private cause. Dia. Sir, Ile redargue you, By disputation. Com. O let's heare this! I long to heare a man dispute in his shirt Of valour, and his sword drawne in his hand. Pra. His valour will take cold; put on your doublet. Com. His valour will keepe cold, you are deceiv'd; And relish much the sweter in our eares: It may be too, i' the ordinance of nature. Their valours are not yet so combatant, Or truly antagonistick, as to fight; But may admit to heare of some divisions, Of Fortitude, may put 'hem off their Quarrell. Dia. I would have no man thinke me so ungovern'd, Or subject to my passion, but I can Reade him a Lecture 'twixt my undertakings, And executions: I doe know all kinds Of doing the busines, which the Towne cals valour. Com. Yes, he has read the Towne, Towne-top's his Author! Your first? Dia. Is a rash head-long unexperience. Com. Which is in Children, Fooles, or your street Gallants O' the first head. Pra. A pretty kind of valour! Com. Commend him, he will spin it out in's shirt, Fine, as that thred. Dia. The next, an indiscreet Presumption, grounded upon often scapes. Com. Or th'insufficiencie of Adversaries, And this is in your common fighting Brothers. Your old Perdu's, who (after a time) doe thinke, The one, that they are shot free; the other, sword free. Your third? Dia. Is nought but an excesse of choller, That raignes in testy old men—. Com. Noble mens Porters, And selfe conceited Poëts. Dia. And is rather A peevishnesse, then any part of valour. Pra. He but reherses, he concludes no valour. Com. A history of distempers, as they are practiz'd, His Harangue undertaketh, and no more. Your next? Dia. Is a dull desperate resolving. Com. In case of some necessitous misery, or Incumbent mischiefe. Pra. Narrownesse of mind, Or ignorance being the root of it. Dia. Which shou shall find in Gamesters, quite blowne up. Com. Banckrupt Merchants, undiscovered Traytors. Pra. Or your exemplified Malefactors, That have surviv'd their infamy, and punishment. Com. One that hath lost his eares, by a just sentence O' the Starre-Chamber, a right valiant Knave— And is a Histrionicall Contempt, Of what a man feares most; it being a mischiefe In his owne apprehension unavoidable. Pra. Which is in Cowards wounded mortally, Or Theeves adjudg'd to die. Com. This is a valour, I should desire much to see incourag'd: As being a speciall entertainment For our rogue People; and make oft good sport Vnto 'hem, from the Gallowes to the ground. Dia. But mine is a Judiciall resolving, Or liberall undertaking of a danger—. Com. That might be avoided. Dia. I, and with assurance, That it is found in Noble-men, and Gentlemen, Of the best sheafe. Com. Who having lives to lose, Like private men, have yet a world of honour, And publike reputation to defend—. Dia. Which in the brave historified Greeks, And Romans you shall reade of. Com. And (no doubt) May in our Alder-men meet it, and their Deputies, The Souldiers of the Citie, valiant blades, Who (rather then their houses should be ransack'd) Would fight it out, like so many wild beasts; Not for the fury they are commonly arm'd with: But the close manner of their fight, and custome, Of joyning head to head, and foot to foot. Iro. And which of these so well-prest resolutions Am I to encounter now? For commonly, Men that have so much choise before 'hem, have Some trouble to resolve of any one. Bia. There are three valours yet, which Sir Diaphanous, Hath (with his leave) not touch'd. Dia. Yea? which are those? Pra. He perks at that! Com. Nay, he does more, he chatters Bia. A Philosophicall contempt of death, Is one: Then an infused kind of valour, Wrought in us by our Genii, or good spirits; Of which the gallant Ethnicks had deepe sense: Who generally held, that no great States-man, Scholler, or Souldier, ere did any thing Sine divino aliquo afflatu. Pra. But there's a Christian valour, 'bove these too. Bia. Which is a quiet patient toleration, Of whatsoever the malitious world With Injury doth unto you; and consists In passion, more then action, Sir Diaphanous. Dia. Sure, I doe take mine to be Christian valour—. Com. You may mistake though. Can you justifie On any cause, this seeking to deface, The divine Image in a man? Bia. O Sir! Let 'hem alone: Is not Diaphanous As much a divine Image, as is Ironside? Let Images fight, if they will fight, a God's name. Scene VI. To them intervening. Keepe. Needle. Interest. Kee. Where's Mr. Needle? Saw you Mr. Needle? Wee are undone. Com. What ailes the frantick Nurse? Kee. My Mistris is undone, shee's crying out! Where is this man trow? Mr. Needle? Nee. Here. Kee. Run for the party, Mrs. Chaire the Mid-wife. Nay, looke how the man stands, as he were gok't! Shee's lost, if you not haste away the party. Nee. Where is the Doctor? Kee. Where a scoffing man is. And his Apothecary, little better; They laugh, and geere at all: will you dispatch? And fetch the party quickly to our Mistris: Wee are all undone! The Timpanie will out else. Int. Newes, newes, good newes, better then butter'd newes! My Neice is found with Child, the Doctor tels me, And falne in labour. Com. How? Int. The portion's paid! Exit. The portion—o' the Captaine! Is he here? Pra. H' has spi'd your swords out! put 'hem up, put up, Yo' have driven him hence; and yet your quarrell's ended. Iro. In a most strange discovery. Pra. Of light gold. Dia. And crack't within the Ring. I take the Omen, As a good Omen. Pra. Then put up your Sword, And on your Doublet. Give the Captaine thankes. Dia. I had beene slur'd else. Thanke you noble Captaine! Your quarrelling caus'd all this. Iro. Where's Compasse? Pra. Gone, Shrunke hence,! contracted to his Center, I feare. Iro. The slip is his then. Dia. I had like t'have beene Abus'd i' the busines, had the slip slur'd on me, A Counterfeit. Bias. Sir, we are all abus'd: As many as were brought on to be Suitors; And we will joyne in thankes, all to the Captaine, And to his fortune that so brought us off. Chorus. Dam. This was a pittifull poore shift o' your Poët, Boy, to make his prime woman with child, and fall in labour, just to compose a quarrell. Boy. With whose borrowed eares, have you heard, Sir, all this while, that you can mistake the current of our Scene so? The streame of the Argument, threatned her being with child from the very beginning, for it presented her in the first of the second Act, with some apparent note of infirmity, or defect: from knowledge of which, the Auditory were rightly to bee suspended by the Author, till the quarrell, which was but the accidentall cause, hastned on the discovery of it, in occasioning her affright; which made her fall into her throwes presently, and within that compasse of time allow'd to the Comedy, wherein the Poët exprest his prime Artifice, rather then any errour, that the detection of her being with child, should determine the quarrell, which had produc'd it. Pro. The Boy is too hard for you. Brother Damplay, best marke the Play, and let him alone. Dam. I care not for marking the Play: Ile damne it, talke, and doe that I come for. I will not have Gentlemen lose their priviledge, nor I my selfe my prerogative, for neere an overgrowne, or superannuated Poët of 'hem all. Hee shall not give me the Law; I will censure, and be witty, and take my Tobacco, and enjoy my Magna Charta of reprehension, as my Predecessors have done before me. Boy. Even to license, and absurdity. Pro. Not now, because the Gentlewoman is in travell: and the Midwife may come on the sooner, to put her and us out of our paine. Dam. Well, looke to your busines afterward, Boy, that all things bee cleare, and come properly forth, suited, and set together; for I will search what followes severely and to the naile. Boy. Let your naile run smooth then, and not scratch: lest the Author be bold to pare it to the quick, and make it smart: you'l find him as severe as your selfe. Dam. A shrewd Boy! and has mee every where. The Mid-wife is come, she has made haste.</field>

Stay Mr. Needle, you doe prick too fast Vpo' the busines: I must take some breath: Lend me my stoole, you ha' drawne a stitch upon me, In faith, sonne Needle, with your haste. Nee. Good Mother, peice up this breach; Ile gi' you a new Gowne, A new silke-Grogoran Gowne. Ile do't Mother. Kee. What 'll you doe? you ha' done too much already With your prick-seame, and through-stitch. Mr. Needle, I pray you sit not fabling here old tales, Good Mother Chaire, the Mid-wife, but come up. Scene II. Compasse. Keepe. Practise. Com. How now Nurse, where's my Lady? Kee. In her Chamber Lock'd up, I thinke: shee'll speake with no body. Com. Knowes shee o' this accident? Kee. Alas Sir, no; Would she might never know it. Pra. I thinke her Ladiship Too vertuous, and too nobly innocent, To have a hand in so ill-form'd a busines. Com. Your thought Sir is a brave thought, and a safe one, The child now to be borne is not more free, From the aspersion of all spot, then she? She have her hand in plot, 'gainst Mr. Practise. If there were nothing else, whom she so loves? Cries up, and values? knowes to be a man Mark'd out, for a chiefe Justice in his cradle? Or a Lord Paramount; the head o' the Hall? The Top or the Top-gallant of our Law? Assure your selfe, she could not so deprave, The rectitude of her Judgement, to wish you Vnto a wife, might prove your Infamy, Whom she esteem'd that part o' the Common-wealth, And had up for honour to her blood. Pra. I must confesse a great beholdingnesse Vnto her Ladiships offer, and good wishes. But the truth is, I never had affection, Or any liking to this Neice of hers. Com. You fore-saw somewhat then? Pra. I had my notes, And my Prognosticks. Com. You read Almanacks, And study 'hem to some purpose, I beleeve? Pra. I doe confesse, I doe beleeve, and pray too: According to the Planets at sometimes. Com. And doe observe the signe in making Love? Pra. As in Phlebotomy. Com. And choose your Mistris By the good dayes, and leave her by the bad? Pra. I doe, and I doe not. Com. A little more Would fetch all his Astronomie from Allestree. Pra. I tell you Mr. Compasse, as my friend, And under seale, I cast mine eye long since, Vpo' the other wench, my Ladies woman, Another manner of peice for handsomnesse, Then is the Neice (but that is sub sigillo, And as I give it you) in hope o' your aid, And counsell in the busines. Com. You need counsell? The only famous Counsell, o' the kingdome, And in all Courts? That is a Jeere in faith, Worthy your name, and your profession too, Sharpe Mr. Practise. Pra. No, upo' my Law, As I am a Bencher, and now double Reader, I meant in meere simplicity of request. Com. If you meant so. Th'affaires are now perplex'd, And full of trouble, give 'hem breath, and setling, Ile doe my best. But in meane time doe you Prepare the Parson. (I am glad to know This; for my selfe lik'd the young Maid before, And lov'd her too.) Ha' you a Licence? Pra. No; But I can fetch one straight. Com. Doe, doe, and mind The Parsons pint t'ingage him—the busines; A knitting Cup there must be. Pra. I shall doe it. Scene III. Bias. Interest. Compasse. Bia. Tis an affront, from you Sir; you here brought me, Vnto my Ladies, and to wooe a wife, Which since is prov'd a crack'd commoditie; Shee hath broke bulke too soone. Int. No fault of mine, If she be crack'd in peeces, or broke round; It was my sisters fault, that ownes the house, Where she hath got her clap, makes all this noise. I keepe her portion safe, that is not scatter'd: The money's rattle not; nor are they throwne, To make a Musse, yet 'mong the gamesome Suitors. Com. Can you endure that flout, close Mr. Bias, And have beene so bred in the Politiques? The injury is done you, and by him only; He lent you imprest money, and upbraids it: Furnish'd you for the wooing, and now waves you. Bia. That makes me to expostulate the wrong So with him, and resent it as I doe. Com. But doe it home then. Bia. Sir, my Lord shall know it. Com. And all the Lords o' the Court too. Bia. What a Moath You are Sir Interest! Int. Wherein I intreat you, Sweet Master Bias? Com. To draw in young States-men, And heires of policie into the noose Of an infamous matrimonie. Bia. Yes, Infamous, quasi in communem famam: And Matrimony, quasi, matter of Money. Com. Learnedly urg'd, my cunning Mr. Bias. Bia. With his lewd, knowne, and prostituted Neice. Int. My knowne, and prostitute: how you mistake, And run upon a false ground, Mr. Bias! (Your Lords will doe me right.) Now, she is prostitute, And that I know it (please you understand me.) I meane to keepe the portion in my hands: And pay no monies. Com. Marke you that Don Bias? And you shall still remaine in bonds to him, For wooing furniture, and imprest charges. Int. Good Mr. Compasse, for the summes he has had Of me, I doe acquit him: They are his owne. Here, before you, I doe release him. Com. Good! Bia. O Sir. Com. 'Slid take it: I doe witnesse it: Hee cannot hurle away his money better. Int. He shall get so much Sir, by my acquaintance, To be my friend: And now report to his Lords As I deserve no otherwise. Com. But well: And I will witnesse it, and to the value; Foure hundred is the price, if I mistake not, Of your true friend in Court. Take hands, you ha'bought him, And bought him cheap. Bia. I am his worships servant. Com. And you his slave, Sir Moath. Seal'd, and deliver'd. Ha' you not studied the Court Complement? Here are a paire of Humours, reconcil'd now, That money held at distance: or their thoughts, Baser then money. Scene IV. Polish. Keepe. Compasse. Pol. Out thou catife witch! Baud, Beggar, Gipsey: Any thing indeed, But honest woman. Kee. What you please, Dame Polish, My Ladies Stroaker. Com. What is here to doe? The Gossips out! Pol. Thou art a Traytor to me, An Eve, the Apul, and the Serpent too: A Viper, that hast eat a passage through me, Through mine owne bowels, by thy retchlesnesse. Com. What frantick fit is this? Ile step aside And hearken to it. Pol. Did I trust thee, wretch, With such a secret, of that consequence, Did so concerne me, and my child, our livelihood, And reputation? And hast thou undone us? By thy connivence, nodding in a corner, And suffering her begot with child so basely? Sleepie unlucky Hag! Thou bird of night, And all mischance to me. Kee. Good Lady Empresse! Had I the keeping of your Daughters clicket In charge? was that committed to my trust? Com. Her Daughter. Pol. Softly Divell, not so low'd, You'ld ha' the house heare, and be witnesse, would you? Kee. Let all the world be witnesse. Afore Ile Endure the Tyrannie of such a tongue— And such a pride—. Pol. What will you doe? Kee. Tell truth, And shame the She-man-Divell in puff'd sleeves; Run any hazzard, by revealing all Vnto my Lady: how you chang'd the cradles, And chang'd the children in 'hem. Pol. Not so high! Kee. Calling your Daughter Pleasance, there Placentia, And my true Mistris by the name of Pleasance. Com. A horrid secret, this! worth the discovery; Pol. And must you be thus lowd? Kee. I will be lowder: And cry it through the house, through every roome, And every office of the Lawndry-maids: Till it be borne hot to my Ladies eares. Ere I will live in such a slavery, Ile doe away my selfe. Pol. Didst thou not sweare To keepe it secret? and upon what booke? (I doe remember now) The Practice of Piety. Kee. It was a practice of impiety, Out of your wicked forge, I know it now, My conscience tels me. First, against the Infants, To rob them o' their names, and their true parents; T'abuse the neighbour-hood, keepe them in errour; But most my Lady: Shee has the maine wrong: And I wil let her know it instantly. Repentance, (if it be true) nere comes too late. Pol. What have I done? Conjur'd a spirit up I sha' not lay againe? drawne on a danger, And ruine on my selfe thus, by provoking A peevish foole, whom nothing will pray of, Or satisfie I feare? Her patience stirr'd, Is turn'd to fury. I have run my Barke, On a sweet Rock, by mine owne arts, and trust: And must get off againe, or dash in peeces. Com. This was a busines, worth the listning after. Scene V. Pleasance. Compasse. Ple. O Mr. Compasse, did you see my Mother? Mistris Placentia, my Ladies Neice; Is newly brought to bed o' the bravest boy! Will you goe see it? Com. First, Ile know the father, Ere I approach these hazards. Ple. Mistris Midwife Has promis'd to find out a father for it, If there be need. Com. Shee may the safelier do't, By vertue of her place. But pretty Pleasance, I have a newes for you, I thinke will please you. Ple. What is't Mr. Compasse? Com.

Com. I would not have him seene here for a world, To breed supition. Doe you intercept him, And prevent that. But trke your Licence with you, And fill the blanke: or leave it here with me, Ile doe it for you, stay you with us at his Church, Behind the old Exchange, wee'll come i'th Coach, And meet you there within this Quarter at least. Pra. I am much bound unto you, Mr. Compasse, You have all the Law, and parts of Squire Practise For ever at your use. Ile tell you newes, too: Sir, your Reversion's fall'n: Thin-wits dead, Surveyor of the Projects generall. Com. When died he? Pra. Eene this morning, I receiv'd it From a right hand. Com. Conceal it Mr. Practise, And mind the maine affaire, you are in hand with. Ple. The Coach is ready Sir. Com. 'Tis well faire Pleasance, Though now wee shall not use it, bid the Coach-man Drive to the Parish Church, and stay about there, Till Mr. Practise come to him, and imploy him: I have a Licence now, which must have entry Before my Lawyers. Noble Parson Palate, Thou shalt be a marke advanc't: here's a peece, And doe a feat for me. Pal. What, Mr. Compasse? Com. But run the words of Matrimony, over My head, and Mrs. Pleasances in my Chamber: There's Captaine Ironside to be a witnesse: And here's a Licence to secure thee. Parson! What doe you stick at? Pal. It is after-noone Sir, Directly against the Canon of the Church; You know it Mr. Compasse: and beside, I am ingag'd unto our worshipfull friend, The learned Mr. Practise in that busines. Com. Come on, ingage your selfe: Who shall be able To say you married us, but i'the morning, The most canonicall minute o' the day, If you affirme it? That's a spic'd excuse, And shewes you have set the Common Law, before Any profession else, of love, or friendship. Come Mrs. Pleasance, wee cannot prevaile With th'rigid Parson here; but Sir, Ile keepe you Lock'd in my lodging, 'till 't be done elsewhere, And under feare of Ironside. Pal. Doe you heare, Sir? Com. No, no, it matters not. Pal. Can you thinke Sir I would deny you anything? not to losse Of both my Livings: I will doe it for you, Ha' you a wedding Ring? Com.

And shall: you should not fret so, Mrs. Polish, Nor you Dame Keepe; my Daughter shall doe well, When she has tane my Cawdle. I ha' knowne. Twenty such breaches piec'd up, and made whole, Without a bum of noise. You two fall out? And teare up one another? Pol. Blessed woman? Blest be the Peace-maker. Kee. The Peace-dresser! Ile heare no peace from her. I have beene wrong'd, So has my Lady, my good Ladies worship, And I will right her, hoping shee'll right me. Pol. Good gentle Keepe, I pray thee Mistris Nurse, Pardon my passion, I was misadvis'd, Be thou yet better, by this grave sage woman, Who is the Mother of Matrons, and great persons, And knowes the world. Kee. I doe confesse, she knowes Something—and I know something—. Pol. Put your somethings Together then. Cha. I, here's a chance falne out You cannot helpe; lesse can this Gentlewoman; I can and will, for both. First, I have sent By-chop away; the cause gone, the fame ceaseth. Then by my Cawdle, and my Cullice, I set My Daughter on her feet, about the house here: Shee's young, and must stirre somewhat for necessity, Her youth will beare it out. She shall pretend, T'have had a fit o' the Mother: there is all. If you have but a Secretary Landresse, To blanch the Linnen—Take the former counsels Into you; keepe them safe i' your owne brests; And make your Merkat of hem at the highest. Will you goe peach, and cry your selfe a foole At Granam's Crosse? be laugh'd at, and dispis'd? Betray a purpose, which the Deputie Of a double Ward, or scarce his Alderman, With twelve of the wisest Questmen could find out, Imployed by the Authority of the Citie? Come, come, be friends: and keepe these women-matters, Smock-secrets to our selves, in our owne verge. Wee shall marre all, if once we ope the mysteries O' the Tyring-house, and tell what's done within: No Theaters are more cheated with apparances, Or these shop-lights, then th'Ages, and folke in them, That seeme most curious. Pol. Breath of an Oracle! You shall be my deare Mother; wisest woman That ever tip'd her tongue, with point of reasons, To turne her hearers! Mistris Keepe, relent, I did abuse thee; I confesse to pennance: And on my knees aske thee forgivenesse. Cha. Rise, She doth begin to melt, I see it—. Kee. Nothing Griev'd me so much, as when you call'd me Baud: Witch did not trouble me, nor Gipsie; no Nor Beggar. But a Baud, was such a name! Cha. No more rehearsals; Repetitions Make things the worse: The more wee stirre (you know The Proverbe, and it signifies a) stink. What's done, and dead, let it be buried. New houres will fit fresh handles, to new thoughts. Scene VIII. Interest, with his Foot-boy. To them Compasse. Ironside. Silkeworme. Palate. Pleasance. To them the Lady: and after Practise. Int. Run to the Church, Sirrah. Get all the Drunkards To ring the Bels, and jangle them for joy My Neice hath brought an Heire unto the house, A lusty boy. Where's my sister Loadstone? Asleepe at afternoones! It is not wholesome; Against all rules of Physick, Lady sister. The little Doctor will not like it. Our Neice Is new deliver'd of a chopping Child, Can call the Father by the name already, If it but ope the mouth round. Mr. Compasse, He is the man, they say, fame gives it out, Hath done that Act of honour to our house, And friendship to pompe out a Sonne, and Heire, That shall inherit nothing, surely nothing From me at least. I come t'invite your Ladiship To be a witnesse; I will be your Partner, And give it a horne-spoone, and a treene dish; Bastard, and Beggars badges, with a blanket For Dame the Doxey to march round the Circuit, With bag, and baggage. Com. Thou malitious Knight, Envious Sir Moath, that eates on that which feeds thee, And frets her goodnesse, that sustaines thy being; What company of Mankind would owne thy brother-hood, But as thou hast a title to her blood, Whom thy ill nature hath chose out t'insult on, And vexe thus, for an Accident in her house, As if it were her crime! Good innocent Lady, Thou shew'st thy selfe a true corroding Vermine, Such as thou art. Int. Why, gentle Mr. Compasse? Because I wish you joy of your young Sonne, And Heire to the house, you ha' sent us? Com. I ha' sent you? I know not what I shall doe. Come in friends: Madam, I pray you be pleas'd to trust your selfe Vnto our company. Lad. I did that too late; Which brought on this calamity upon me, With all the infamy I heare; your Souldier, That swaggering Guest. Com. Who is return'd here to you, Your vowed friend, and servant; comes to sup with you, So wee doe all; and 'll prove he hath deserv'd, That speciall respect, and favour from you, As not your fortunes, with your selfe to boote, Cast on a Feather-bed, and spread o'th' sheets Vnder a brace of your best Persian Carpets, Were scarce a price to thanke his happy merit. Int. What impudence is this? can you indure To heare it sister? Com. Yes, and you shall heare it; Who will indure it worse. What deserves he In your opinion, Madam, or weigh'd Judgement, That, things thus hanging (as they doe in doubt) Suspended, and suspected, all involv'd, And wrapt in errour, can resolve the knot? Redintigrate the fame, first of your house? Restore your Ladiships quiet? render then Your Neice a Virgin, and unvitiated? And make all plaine, and perfect (as it was) A practise to betray you, and your name? Int. Hee speakes impossibilities. Com. Here he stands, Whose fortune hath done this, and you must thanke him: To what you call his swaggering, wee owe all this. And that it may have credit with you Madam, Here is your Neice, whom I have married, witnesse These Gentlemen, the Knight, Captaine, and Parson, And this grave Politique Tell-troth of the Court. Lad. What's she that I call Neice then? Com. Polishes Daugh Her Mother Goodwy' Polish hath confess'd it To Granam Keepe, the Nurse, how they did change The children in their Cradles. Lad. To what purpose? Com. To get the portion, or some part of it, Which you must now disburse intire to me, Sir, If I but gaine her Ladiships consent. Lad. I bid God give you joy, if this be true. Com. As true it is, Lady, Lady, i'th' song. The portion's mine, with interest Sir Moath; I will not 'bate you a single Harrington, Of interest upon interest. In meane time, I doe commit you to the Guard of Ironside. My brother here, Captaine Rudhudibras: From whom I will expect you, or your Ransome. Int. Sir you must prove it, and the possibility, Ere I beleeve it. Com. For the possibility, I leave to triall. Truth shall speake it selfe. O Mr. Practise, did you meet the Coach? Pra. Yes Sir, but empty. Com. Why, I sent it for you. The busines is dispatch'd here, ere you come; Come in, Ile tell you how: you are a man Will looke for satisfaction, and must have it. All. So doe wee all, and long to heare the right. Chorus. Dam. Troth, I am one of those that labour with the same longing, for it is almost pucker'd, and pull'd into that knot, by your Poët, which I cannot easily, with all the strength of my imagination, untie. Boy. Like enough, nor is it in your office to be troubled or perplexed with it, but to sit still, and expect. The more your imagination busies it selfe, the more it is intangled, especially if (as I told, in the beginning) you happen on the wrong end. Pro. He hath said sufficient, Brother Damplay; our parts that are the Spectators, or should heare a Comedy, are to await the processe, and events of things, as the Poet presents them, not as wee would corruptly fashion them. Wee come here to behold Playes, and censure them, as they are made, and fitted for us; not to beslave our owne thoughts, with censorious spitle tempering the Poets clay, as wee were to mould every Scene anew: That were a meere Plastick, or Potters ambition, most unbecomming the name of a Gentleman. No, let us marke, and not lose the busines on foot, by talking. Follow the right thred, or find it. Dam. Why, here his Play might have ended, if hee would ha' let it; and have spar'd us the vexation of a fift Act yet to come, which every one here knowes the issue of already, or may in part conjecture. Boy. That conjecture is a kind of Figure-flinging, or throwing the Dice, for a meaning was never in the Poets purpose perhaps. Stay, and see his last Act, his Catastrophe, how hee will perplexe that, or spring some fresh cheat, to entertaine the Spectators, with a convenient delight, till some unexpected, and new encounter breake out to rectifie all, and make good the Conclusion. Pro. Which, ending here, would have showne dull, flat, and unpointed; without any shape, or sharpenesse, Brother Damplay. Dam. Well, let us expect then: And wit be with us, o' the Poets part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. Scene I. Needle. Item. Nee. Troth Mr. Item, here's a house divided, And quarter'd into parts, by your Doctors ingine. H'has cast out such aspersions on my Ladies Neice here, of having had a Child; as hardly Will be wip'd off, I doubt. Ite. Why, is't not true? Nee. True! did you thinke it? Ite. Was shee not in labour? The Mid-wife sent for? Ite. There's your errour now! Yo' ha' drunke o' the same water. Item. I beleev'd it, And gave it out too. Nee. More you wrong'd the party; She had no such thing about her, innocent creature! Iem. What had she then? only a fit o' the Mother! They burnt old shoes, Goose-feathers, Assa fœtida, A few horne shavings, with a bone, or two, And she is well againe, about the house;— Ite. Is't possible? Nee. See it, and then report it. Ite. Our Doctors Vrinall-Judgement is halfe crack'd then. Nee. Crack't i' the case, most hugely, with my Lady, And sad Sir Moath, her brother; who is now Vnder a cloud a little. Ite. Of what? Disgrace? Nee. He is committed to Rud-hudibras, The Captaine Ironside, upon displeasure, From Mr. Compasse, but it will blow off. Ite. The Doctor shall reverse his, instantly, And set all right againe: if you'll assist But in a toy; Squire Needle, comes i' my nodle now. Nee. Good, Needle and Nodle! what may't be? I long for't. Ite. Why, but to goe to bed: faine a distemper Of walking i' your sleepe, or talking in't A little idly, but so much, as on' it, The Doctor may have ground, to raise a cure For's reputation. Nee. Any thing, to serve The worship o' the man I love and honour. Scene II. Polish. Pleasance. Chaire. Placentia. Keepe. Pol. O! gi' you joy Madamoiselle Compasse! You are his Whirle-poole now: all to be married, Against your Mothers leave, and without counsell! H'has fish'd faire, and caught a Frog, I feare it. What fortune ha' you to bring him in dower? You can tell stories now: you know a world Of secrets to discover. Ple. I know nothing But what is told me; nor can I discover Any thing. Pol. No, you shall not, Ile take order.

And call'd her Neice againe, and view'd her Linnen. Pol. You ha' done a Miracle, Mother Chaire. Cha. Not I, My Cawdle has done it. Thanke my Cawdle heartily. Pol. It shall be thank'd, and you too, wisest Mother; You shall have a new, brave, foure-pound Beaver hat, Set with enamell'd studs, as mine is here: And a right paire of Cristall Spectacles, Cristall o'th' Rock, thou mighty Mother of Dames, Hung in an Ivory Case, at a gold Belt, And silver Bels to gingle, as you pase Before your fiftie Daughters in procession To Church, or from the Church. Cha. Thankes Mrs. Polish. Kee. She does deserve as many pensions, As there be peeces in a—Maiden-head; Were I a Prince to give 'hem. Pol. Come sweet Charge, You shall present your selfe about the house, be confident, and beare up; you shall be seene. Scene III. Compasse. Ironside. Practise. Com. What? I can make you amends, my learned Counsell, And satisfie a greater Injury To chafed Mr. Practise. Who would thinke That you could be thus testie? Iro. A grave head! Gi'n over to the study of our Lawes. Com. And the prime honours of the Common-wealth. Iro. And you to mind a wife. Com. What should you doe With such a toy as a wife, that might distract you, Or hinder you i' your Course? Iro. He shall not thinke on't. Com. I will make over to you my Possession, Of that same place is falne (you know) to satisfie Surveyor of the Projects generall. Iro. And that's an office, you know how to stirre in. Com. And make your profits of. Iro. Which are (indeed) The ends of a gown'd man: Shew your activity, And how you are built for busines. Pra. I accept it As a P ssession, be't but a Reversion. Com. You first told me 'twas a Possession. Pra. I, I told you that I heard so. Iro. All is one, Hee'll make Reversion a Possession quickly. Com. But I must have a generall Release from you. Pra. Doe one, Ile doe the other. Com. It's a match Before my brother Ironside. Pra. 'Tis done. Com. Wee two are reconcil'd then. Iro. To a Lawyer, That can make use of a place, any halfe title, Is better then a wife. Com. And will save charges Of Coaches, Vellute Gownes, and cut-worke Smocks. Iro. Hee is to occupie an office wholly. Com. True, I must talke with you neerer, Mr. Practise, About recovery o' my wives portion, What way I were best to take. Pra. The plainest way. Com. What's that, for plainenesse? Pra. Sue him at Common-Law: Arrest him on an Action of Choke-baile, Five hundred thousand pound; it will affright him, And all his sureties. You can prove your marriage? Com. Yes. Wee'll talke of it within, and heare my Lady. Scene IV. Interest. Lady. Rut. Item. Int. I'am sure, the Rogue o' the house went all that way; She was with Child, and Mr. Compasse got it. Lad. Why, that you see, is manifestly false, H'has married the other; our true Neice he sayes: He would not wooe 'hem both: hee is not such A Stallion, to leape all. Againe, no Child Appeares, that I can find with all my search, And strictest way of Inquiry, I have made Through all my family. A fit o' the Mother, The women say she had, which the Mid-wife cur'd, With burning bones and feathers: Here's the Doctor. Enter Doctor. Int. O noble Doctor, did not you, and your Item, Tell me our Neice was in labour? Rut. If I did, What followes? Int. And that Mother Mid-night Was sent for? Rut. So she was; and is i'the house still. Int. But here has a noise beene since, she was deliver'd Of a brave boy, and Mr. Compasse's getting. Rut. I know no rattle of Gossips, nor their noyses. I hope you take not me for a Pimpe errant, To deale in smock Affaires? Where's the Patient? The infirme man, I was sent for, Squire Needle? Lad. Is Needle sick? Rut. My 'Pothecary tels me Enter Tim. Hee is in danger; how is't Tim? where is he? Ite. I cannot hold him downe. Hee's up, and walkes, And talkes in his perfect sleepe, with his eyes shut, As sensibly, as he were broad awake. Rut. See, here he comes. Hee's fast asleepe, observe him. Rut. Hee'll tell us wonders: What doe these women here? Scene V. Rut. Needle. Interest. Item. Lady. Polish. Chaire. Keepe. Placentia.

Ha? what treasure? Rut. If you aske questions, he 'wakes presently: And then you'l heare no more, till his next fit. Nee. And whom she hides it for. Rut. Doe you marke Sir? Int. Nee. A fine she spirit it is, an Indian Mag-pie. She was an Aldermans Widow, and fell in love With our Sir Moath, my Ladies brother. Rut. (Heare you?) Nee. And she has hid an Aldermans estate; Dropt through her bill in little holes, i' the Garden, And scrapes earth over 'hem; where none can spy But I, who see all by the Glowormes light, That creeps before. Pol. I knew the Gentlewoman; Alderman Parrots Widow, a fine Speaker, As any was i' the Clothing, or the Bevy; She did become her scarlet, and black Velvet, Her greene, and purple— Rut. Save thy colours, Rainebow, Or she will run thee over, and all thy lights. Pol. She dwelt in Doo-little Lane, a top o' the hill there; I' the round Cage, was after Sir Chime Squirrell's. Shee would eate nought but Almonds, I assure you. Rut. Would thou had'st a dose of pilles, a double dose, O' the best purge, to make thee turne tale, tother way. Pol. You are a foule mouth'd, purging, absurd Doctor; I tell you true, and I did long to tell it you. You ha' spread a scandall i' my Ladies house here, On her sweet Neice, you never can take off With all your purges, or your plaister of Oathes; Though you distill your Dam-me, drop by drop, I' your defence. That she hath had a Child, Here she doth spit upon thee, and defie thee; Or I do't for her. Rut. Madam, pray you bind her To her behaviour. Tye your Gossip up, Or send her unto Bet'lem. Pol. Goe thou thither, That better hast deserv'd it, shame of Doctors: Where could she be deliver'd? by what charme? Restor'd to her strength so soone? who is the Father? Or where the Infant? Aske your Oracle, That walkes, and talkes in his sleepe. Rut. Where is he? gone? You ha' lost a fortune listning to her, to her Tabour. Good Madam lock her up. Lad. You must give loosers Their leave to speake, good Doctor. Rut. Follow his footing Before he get to his bed: This rest is lost else. Scene VI. Compasse. Practise. Ironside. Polish. Lady. Com. Where is my wife? what ha' you done with my wife, Gossip o' the Counsels? Pol. I, sweet Mr. Compasse? I honour you, and your wife. Com. Well, doe so still. I will not call you Mother tho', but Polish. Good Gossip Polish, where ha' you hid my wife? Pol. I hide your wife? Com. Or she's run away. Lad. That would make all suspected, Sir, a fresh. Come we will find her, if she be i' the house. Pol. Why should I hide your wife, good Mr. Compasse? Com. I know no cause, but that you are goo'dy Polish, That's good at malice; good at mischiefe; all That can perplexe, or trouble a busines, throughly. Pol. You may say, what you will: yo' are Mr. Compasse, And carry a large sweep, Sir, i' your Circle. Lad. Ile sweep all corners, Gossip, to spring this. If't be above ground, I will have her cry'd, By the Common-cryer, through all the Ward, But I will find her. Iro. It will be an Act Worthy your justice, Madam. Pra. And become The integrity, and worship of her name. Scene VII. Rut. Interest. Item. Needle. Rut. 'Tis such a Fly, this Gossip, with her buz, Shee blowes on every thing, in every place! Int. A busie woman, is a fearefull grievance! Will hee not sleepe againe? Rut. Yes instantly, As soone as he is warme. It is the nature Of the disease, and all these cold dry fumes, That are melancholicke, to worke at first, Slow, and insensibly in their ascent, Till being got up, and then distilling downe Vpo' the braine; they have a pricking quality That breeds this restlesse rest, which we, the sonnes Of Physick, call a walking in the sleepe, And telling mysteries, that must be heard. Softly, with art, as we were sowing pillowes Vnder the Patients elbowes, else they'd fly Into a phrensie, run into the Woods, Where there are Noises, huntings, shoutings, hallowings, Amidst the brakes, and furzes, over bridges Fall into waters: Scratch their flesh: Sometimes Drop downe a præcipice, and there be lost. How now! what does her? Ite. He is up againe, Enter Item. And 'gins to talke. Int. O' the former matter, Item? Ite. The treasure, and the Lady: That's his argument. Int. O mee, happy man! he cannot off it. I shall know all then. Rut. With what appetite Our owne desires delude us! Heare you Tim? Let no man interrupt us. Ite. Sir Diaphanous, And Mr. Bias, his Court-friend's, desire To kisse his Neices hands, and gratulate The firme recovery of her good fame, And honour— Int. Good, say to 'hem, Mr. Item, My Neice is on my Ladies side: they'll find her there. I pray to be but spar'd, for halfe an houre: Ile see 'hem presently. Rut. Doe, put 'hem off, Tim. And tell 'hem the importance of the busines. Here, he is come! sooth; and have all out of him. Nee. How doe you Lady-bird? so hard at worke, still? What's that you say? Doe you bid me walke, sweet Bird? And tell our Knight? I will. How? walke knave, walke? I thinke y' are angry with me Pol. Fine Pol! Pol's a fine bird! O fine Lady Pol! Almond for Parrat; Parrat's a brave bird: Three hundred thousand peeces ha' you stuck, Edge-long into the ground, within the Garden? O' bounteous Bird! Int. And me, most happy creature. Rut. Smother your joy. Nee. How? and drop'd twice so many— Int. Ha! where? Rut. Containe your selfe. Nee. I' the old Well? Int. I cannot, I am a man of flesh, and blood: Who can containe himselfe, to heare the Ghost Of a dead Lady, doe such workes as these? And a Citie Lady too, o' the streight waste? Rut. Hee's gone. Nee. I will goe try the truth of it. Rut. Follow him, Tim: See what he does; if he bring you A 'ssay of it now. Int. Ile say hee's a rare fellow: And has a rare disease. Rut. And I will worke As rare a cure upon him. Int. How, good Doctor? Rut. When he hath utter'd all, that you would know of him; Ile clense him with a pill (as small as a pease) And stop his mouth: for there his issue lies, Betweene the Muscles o' the tongue. Int. Hee's come. Rut. What did he, Item? Ite. The first step he stept Into the Garden, he pull'd these five peices Vp, in a fingers bredth one of another. The durt sticks on 'hem still. Int. I know enough. Doctor, proceed with your Cure, Ile make thee famous, Famous among the sonnes of the Physicians, Machaon, Podalirius, Esculapius. Thou shalt have a golden beard, as well as he had; And thy Tim Item here, have one of silver: A livery beard. And all thy 'Pothecaries Belong to thee. Where's Squire Needle? gone? Ite. Hee's prick'd away, now he has done the worke. Rut. Prepare his pill, and gi' it him afore Supper. Int. Ile send for a dozen o' labourers to morrow, To turne the surface o' the Garden up. Rut. In mould? bruise every clod? Int. And have all fifted; For Ile not loose a peice o' the Birds bounty, And take an Inventory of all. Rut. And then, I would goe downe into the Well— Int. My selfe; No trusting other hands: Sixe hundred thousand, To the first three; nine hundred thousand pound— Rut. 'Twill purchase the whole Bench of Aldermanity, Stript to their shirts. Int. There never did accrew, So great a gift to man, and from a Lady, I never saw but once; now I remember, Wee met at Merchants-Taylors-hall, at dinner, In Thred-needle street, Rut. Which was a signe Squire Needle Should have the thredding of this thred. Int. 'Tis true; I shall love Parrots better, while I know him. Rut. Il'd have her statue cut, now in white marble. Int. And have it painted in most orient colours. Rut. That's right! all Citie statues must be painted: Else, they be worth nought i' their subtile Judgements. Scene VIII. Interest. Bias. Rut. Palate. Int. My truest friend in Court, deare Mr. Bias; You heare o'the recovery of our Neice In fame, and credit? Bia. Yes, I have beene with her, And gratulated to her; but I am sory To find the Author o' the fowle aspersion Here i' your company, this insolent Doctor. Int. You doe mistake him: He is cleare got off on't. A Gossips Jealousie first gave the hint. He drives another way, now, as I would have him. Hee's a rare man, the Doctor, in his way. H' has done the noblest cure here, i' the house, On a poore Squire, my sisters Taylor, Needle That talk'd in's sleepe; would walke to Saint Iohn's wood, And Waltham Forrest, scape by all the ponds, And pits i' the way; run over two-inch bridges; With his eyes fast, and i' the dead of night! Ile ha' you better acquainted with him. Doctor, Here is my deare, deare, dearest friend in Court, Wise, powerfull Mr. Bias; pray you salute Each other, not as strangers, but true friends. Rut. This is the Gentleman you brought to day, A Suitor to your Neice? Int. Yes. Rut. You were Agreed, I heard; the writings drawne betweene you? Int. And seald. Rut. What broke you off? Int. This rumour of her? Was it not Mr. Bias? Bia. Which I find Now false, and therefore come to make amends I' the first place. I stand to the old conditions. Rut. Faith give 'hem him, Sir Moath, what ere they were. You have a brave occasion now, to crosse The flanting Mr. Compasse, who pretends Right to the portion, by th'other Intaile. Int. And claimes it. You doe heare he's married? Bia. We heare his wife is run away from him, Within: She is not to be found i' the house, With all the Hue, and Cry is made for her, Through every roome; the Larders ha' beene search'd, The Bak-houses, and Boulting-tub, the Ovens, Wash-house, and Brew-house, nay the very Fornace, And yet she is not heard of. Int. Be she nere heard of, The safety of Great Brittaine lyes not on't. You are content with the ten thousand pound, Defalking the foure hundred garnish money? That's the condition here, afore the Doctor, And your demand, friend Bias. Bia. It is Sir Moath. Enter Palate. Rut. Here comes the Parson then, shall make all sure. Int. Goe you with my friend Bias, Parson Palate, Vnto my Neice; assure them wee are agreed. Pal. And Mrs. Compasse too, is found within. Int. Where was she hid? Pal. In an old Botle-house, Where they scrap'd trenchers; there her mother had thrust her. Rut. You shall have time, Sir, to triumph on him, When this fine feate is done, and his Rud-Ironside. Scene IX. Compasse. Pleasance. Lady. Ironside. Practise. Polish. Chaire. Keepe. &amp;c. Com. Was ever any Gentlewoman us'd So barbarously by a malitious Gossip, Pretending to be Mother to her too? Pol. Pretending! Sir, I am her Mother, and challenge A right, and power for what I have done. Com. Out, Hag. Thou that hast put all nature off, and woman: For sordid gaine, betray'd the trust committed Vnto thee by the dead, as from the living: Chang'd the poore innocent Infants in their Cradles: Defrauded them o' their parents, chang'd their names, Calling Placentia, Pleasance; Pleasance, Placentia. Pol. How knowes he this? Com. Abus'd the neighbour-hood; But most this Lady. Did'st enforce an oath, To this poore woman, on a pious booke, To keepe close thy impiety. Pol. Ha' you told this? Kee. I told it? no, he knowes it, and much more, As he's a cunning man. Pol. A cunning foole, If that be all. Com. But now to your true daughter, That had the Child, and is the proper Pleasance, Wee must have an account of that too, Gossip; Pol. This's like all the rest of Mr. Compasse. Scene X. Enter to them running, Rut. Rut. Helpe, helpe for Charity; Sir Moath Interest Is falne into the Well. Lad. Where? where? Rut. I' the Garden. A rope to save his life. Com. How came he there? Rut. He thought to take possession of a fortune, There newly drop't him, and the old Chaine broke, And downe fell hee i' the Bucket. Com. Is it deepe? Rut. We cannot tell. A rope: helpe with a rope. Sil. He is got out againe. The Knight is sav'd. Enter Silke-worme. Ironside Item. Needle, and Interest. Rut. Iro. A little sows'd i' the water: Needle sav'd him. Ite. The water sav'd him, 'twas a faire escape. Nee. Ha' you no hurt? Int. A little wet. Nee. That's nothing. Rut. I wish'd you stay Sir till to morrow: And told you, It was no lucky houre: since sixe a Clock All starres were retrograde. Lad. I' the name Lady. Of fate, or folly how came you i' the Bucket? Int. That is a Quœre of another time, sister, The Doctor will resolve you—who hath done The admirable'st cure upon your Needle! Gi' me thy hand good Needle: thou cam'st timely. Take off my hood and coat. And let me shake My selfe a little. I have a world of busines. Bias. Where is my Nephew Bias? and his wife? Placentia. Who bids God gi'hem joy? Here they both stand Palate. As sure affianced, as the Parson, or words Can tie 'hem. Rut. Wee all wish 'hem joy, and happinesse. Silk. I saw the Contract, and can witnesse it. Int. He shall receive ten thousand pounds to morrow. You look'd for't, Compasse, or a greater summe, But 'tis dispos'd of, this, another way. I have but one Neice, verely Compasse. Com. Ile find another. Varlet, doe your office. Var. I doe arrest your body, Sir Moath Interest, Varlet. In the Kings name: At suite of Mr. Compasse, And Dame Placentia his wife. The Action's entred, Five hundred thousand pound. Int. Heare you this, sister? And hath your house the eares, to heare it too? And to resound the affront? Lad. I cannot stop The Lawes, or hinder Justice. I can be Your Baile, if't may be taken. Com. With the Captaines, I aske no better. Rut. Here are better men, Will give their Baile. Com. But yours will not be taken, Worshipfull Doctor; you are good security For a suit of clothes, to th'Taylor, that dares trust you: But not for such a summe, as is this Action. Varlet, You know my mind. Var. You must to prison, Sir, Vnlesse you can find Baile the Creditor likes. Int. I would faine find it, if you'd shew me where. Silk. It is a terrible Action; more indeed, Then many a man is worth. And is call'd Fright-Baile. Iro. Faith I will baile him, at mine owne apperill. Varlet, be gone: Ile once ha' the reputation, To be security for such a summe. Beare up Sir Moath. Rut. He is not worth the Buckles About his Belt, and yet this Ironside clashes. Int. Peace, lest he heare you Doctor; wee'll make use of him. What doth your brother Compasse, Captaine Ironside, Demand of us, by way of challenge, thus? Iro. Your Neices portion; in the right of his wife. Int. I have assur'd one portion, to one Neice, And have no more t'account for, that I know of: What I may doe in charity—if my sister, Will bid an Offring for her maid, and him, As a Benevolence to 'hem, after Supper, Ile spit into the Bason, and intreat My friends to doe the like. Com. Spit out thy gall, And heart, thou Viper: I will now no mercy, No pitty of thee, thy false Neice, and Needle; Bring forth your Child, or I appeale you of murder, You, and this Gossip here, and Mother Chaire. Pleasance steps out. Cha. The Gentleman's falne mad! Ple. No, Mrs. Midwife. I saw the Child, and you did give it me, And put it i' my armes, by this ill token, You wish'd me such another; and it cry'd. Pra. The Law is plaine; if it were heard to cry, And you produce it not, hee may indict All that conceale't, of Felony, and Murder. Com. And I will take the boldnesse, Sir, to doe it: Beginning with Sir Moath here, and his Doctor. Silk. Good faith this same is like to turne a busines. Pal. And a shrewd busines, marry: they all start at't. Com. I ha' the right thred now, and I will keepe it. You good'y Keepe, confesse the truth to my Lady, The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. Pol. I scorne to be prevented of my glories. I plotted the deceit, and I will owne it. Love to my Child, and lucre of the portion Provok'd me; wherein though th'event hath fail'd In part, I will make use of the best side. This is my Daughter, and she hath had a Child This day, unto her shame, I now professe it.) By this meere false-stick Squire Needle, but Since this wise Knight, hath thought it good to change The foolish Father of it, by assuring Her to his deare friend, Mr. Bias; and him Againe to her, by clapping of him on With his free promise of ten thousand pound, Afore so many witnesses. Silk. Whereof I Am one. Pal. And I another. Pol. I should be unnaturall To my owne flesh, and blood, would I not thanke him. I thanke you Sir: and I have reason for it. For here your true Neice stands, fine Mrs. Compasse. (Ile tell you truth, you have deserv'd it from me.) To whom you are by bond engag'd to pay The sixteene thousand pound, which is her portion, Due to her husband, on her marriage-day. I speake the truth, and nothing but the truth. Iro. You'll pay it now, Sir Moath, with interest? You see the truth breaks out on every side of you. Int. Into what nets of cous'nage am I cast On ev'ry side? each thred is growne a noofe: A very mesh: I have run my selfe into A double breake, of paying twice the money. Bia. You shall be releas'd of paying me a penny, With these conditions. Pal. Will you leave her then? Bia. Yes, and the summe, twice told, ere take a wife, To pick out Mounsieur Needles basting threds. Com. Gossip you are paid: though he be a fit nature, Worthy to have a Whore justly put on him; He is not bad enough to take your Daughter, On such a cheat. Will you yet pay the portion? Int. What will you 'bate? Com. No penny the Law gives. Int. Yes, Bias's money. Com. What? your friend in Court? I will not rob you of him, nor the purchase, Nor your deare Doctor here, stand altogether. Birds of a nature all, and of a feather. Lad. Well, wee are all now reconcil'd to truth. There rests yet a Gratuitie from me, To be conferr'd upon this Gentleman; Who (as my Nephew Compasse sayes) was cause, First of th'offence, but since of all th'amends, The Quarrell caus'd th'affright; that fright brought on The travell, which made peace, the peace drew on This new discovery, which endeth all In reconcilement. Com. When the portion Is tender'd, and receiv'd. Int. Well, you must have it, As good at first as last. 'Tis well said brother. And I, if this good Captaine will accept me, Give him my selfe, endow him with my estate, And make him Lord of me, and all my fortunes: He that hath sav'd my houre, though by chance, Ile really study his, and how to thanke him. Iro. And I imbrace you, Lady, and your goodnesse, And vow to quit all thought of warre hereafter; Save what is fought under your colours, Madam. Pal. More worke then for the Parson; I shall cap The Loadstone with an Ironside, I see. Iro. And take in these, the forlorne Couple, with us, Needle, and's Thred, whose portion I will thinke on; As being a busines, waiting on my bounty: Thus I doe take possession of you, Madam, My true Magnetick Mistris, and my Lady. The end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHORUS Changed into an Epilogve: To the KING. Well, Gentlemen, I now must under seale, And th'Authors charge, waive you, and make my'appeale To the supremest power, my Lord, the King; Who best can judge of what wee humbly bring. Hee knowes our weaknesse, and the Poets faults; Where he doth stand upright, goe firme, or halts; And hee will doome him. To which voice be stands, And prefers that, 'fore all the Peoples hands.</field>
