      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene.âFairyland, which for the purposes of the play, is supposed to be situate on the upper side of a cloud which floats over the earth. The scene represents a land of ideal beauty, with fountains, trees, waterfalls, &amp;c. At L. is the Fairy Queen's bower. Darine and Locrine are discovered on an eminence R.C., up stage, which overlooks gap in the cloud. Locrine. Oh, world below! Oh, wicked world, Where sin and woe Lie all unfurled! Oh, world of shame, Of guilt and greed, Where joy in name Is woe indeed! May angels' tears be shed on thee, Thou wicked world of misery! [As Locrine sings, Fairies enter from different approaches and fill the stage, Neodie, Zayda, Cora, Lila, and others leading them. Enter Darine. Solo. Darine. Oh, picture to thyself a mortal crew Sinning throughout their lives, as demons do! Fierce wild barbaric shapes, all foul withinâ Howling with hunger for more sinâmore sin! Fierce wild barbaric shapes, All head and tail; Some like red raving apes, Some clad in scale; Others like dead-fleshed ghouls With horny eyes, Squatting on black toadstools Of monstrous size! All of them foul without and foul within; All glimmering in the lurid light of sin! Chorus. All of them foul without and foul within; All glimmering in the lurid light of sin! Neodie (recit.). Selene comes; as silvery moon serene, Radiant with loveliness, our sister-Queen! Enter Selene. Chorus. Pure as the air, sweet as the morning dew, Cometh our Queen! Bright in all eyes as Heaven's ethereal blue, Cometh our Queen! Spirit of love! as thou hast ever been, Be to us evermore, oh sister-Queen! Unsullied source Of tranquil joy, Pursue thy course Of pure employâ Be thou, as thou hast ever been, Our all-beloved sister-Queen! Selene. Dear sisters, I bring news. Ere very long, Lutin, who, by the will of that great king To whom we all yield faithful suzerainty, Left Fairyland to join him in mid-earth, Will home return. He is the only one Of our immortal race Who has set foot upon that wicked world! Zayda. Lutin returning! He will set at rest Our wild and wondering theories, and reveal, In picture-painting words, the demon deeds Of all the goblin murder-mongers that Infest that sink of seething infamy! Enter Ethais, a male Fairy, followed by Phyllon, another male Fairy. Ethais. In truth, dear sister, if Man's face and form Were a true index to his character, He were a fearsome thing to look upon. But Man, alas! is formed as we are formed. False from the first, he comes into the world Wearing a smiling lie upon his face That he may cheat ere he can use his tongue! Darine. As we are formed? Phyllon. 'Tis so, in very truth. Dost thou not know that every soul on earth Hath, in our ranks, his fairy counterpart? Darine. His counterpart? Selene. Aye, on that wicked world Thou, I, and all who dwell in Fairyland, May find a parallel identityâ So perfect that, if it were possible To place us by those earthly counterparts, No man on earth, no fairy in the clouds Could tell which was the fairyâwhich the man! Zara. Is there no shade of difference? Phyllon. Yes, one, For we are absolutely free from sin, While all our representatives on earth Are stained with every kind of infamy! Zayda. Are all our counterparts so steeped in sin? Selene. All, in a greater or a less degree. Zayda. What, even mine? Selene. Alas! Zayda. Oh, noânot mine! Selene. All men and women sin! [Selene retires up and exit. Darine. I wonder what My counterpart is doing now! Zayda. Some deed Detestable in its degeneracy! Best not enquire! See, Lutin comes at last! He'll tell theeâso prepare ye for the worst! Enter Lutin, appearing through the gap in the cloud as though rising from the earth below. Chorus. Hail, Lutin, wondrous traveller! Thrice welcome back to Fairyland! Exploring fay, thyself bestir To tell us all That did befall Thy stay amid those mortals banned While far away from Fairyland! Darine. We to ascertain are eager All the ills that did beleaguer And assail thy mortal portals Whilst thou wast among the mortals. Fleta. Didst thou join in all their revels? Drink and dance with all their devils? Didst thou see, with awestruck daring, Dicer dicing, swearer swearing? Zayda. Didst thou watch, with sorrow sobbing, Liar lying, robber robbing, Drinker drinking, gorger gorging, Pinker pinking, forger forging? Locrine. Cooer cooing, biller billing, Wooer wooing, killer killing, Prater prating, blabber blabbing, Hater hating, stabber stabbing? All four. Kicker kicking, beater beating, Sticker sticking, cheater cheating? Tell us all that did befallâ Tell us some and tell us all! Chorus. Tell us all that did befallâ Tell us some and tell us all! Didst thou join in all their revels? Didst thou dance with all their devils? Didst thou watch, with sorrow sobbing, Liar lying, robber robbing? &amp;c. Tell us all that did befallâ Tell us some and tell us all! Lutin (rcit.). What! tell you all? Not so! All that down there occurred? 'Twould numb your souls with aweâ You know not what you ask! Describe you all I know? Repeat you all I heard? Narrate you all I saw? God save me from such a task! One tale I'll try to tellâit will suffice To illustrate their tendency to vice! Song.âLutin. Lutin. One incident I'll tell that will appal Each gentle little heart and head. Come, fairies, gather round me, one and allâ (The details to impart I dread!) A tale to cause a demon's flesh to creep, And absolutely shock his ears; 'Twould summon tears to eyes that never weep, And melt a very rock to tears! Chorus. 'Twould melt a very rock to tears! Lutin. So horribly bad that tale appears, It's scarcely fit for fairy spheres; 'Twould outrage e'en a demon's earsâ And I'm going to tell it to you, my dears! Chorus (in great delight). He's going to tell it to us, my dears! Lutin. Although 'twill make your blood run cold, The terrible details I'll unfold! Chorus. So horribly bad that tale appears, It's scarcely fit for fairy spheres; 'Twould outrage e'en a demon's earsâ Lutin. And I'm going to tell it to you, my dears! There was a gallant knight of Portugee, Who loved a Moorish maid so well That he took ship and sailed for Barbaree (That's where the little jade did dwell). He journeyed o'er the stormy sea apace (Of nothing was that knight afraid), And when at last they met in an embrace, What do you think that naughty maiden said? Chorus. We wonder what the little hussy said! Lutin. She saidâbut no, their dark careers Would shock your souls and draw your tears; They're quite unfit for decent earsâ And I'm hanged if I'll tell 'em to you, my dears! Chorus (disappointed). He'll be hanged if he'll tell 'em to us, my dears! Lutin. First thoughts are silverâsecond, gold; And I'm sorry to say that they can't be told! Chorus (vexed). His tale is cast in mocking mouldâ He says it is both bad and bold; We hoped for details, and beholdâ Lutin and Chorus. I'm/He's sorry to say that they can't be told! Ethais and Phyllon enter. Lutin. Attend. Obedient to our King's command, I met him in mid-earth. He bade me send Both Ethais and Phyllon down below. Ethais. Down to mid-earth? Lutin. Down to mid-earth at once. He hath some gift, some priceless privilege, With which he would endow our fairy world, And he hath chosen Phyllon and thyself To bear his bounty to this home of ours. Zayda. Another boon? Why, brother Ethais, What can our monarch give that we have not? Phyllon. In truth I cannot say! 'Twould seem that we Had reached the sum of fairy happiness! Selene. But then we thought the same before our King Endowed us with the gift of melody; And now how tame our fairy life would seem Were melody to perish from our land! Ethais. Well said, Selene. Come, then, let's away, And on our journey through the outer air We will take note of its inhabitants And bring you full account of all we see. Farewell, dear sistersâ Selene. Brothers, fare ye well! [Ethais and Phyllon take leave of the Fairies and descend through the gap in the cloud. Exit Lutin. Zayda. Now here's a riddle that I cannot solve:â Why do these mortals bear their weight of woe When they can end it at their will? They need Not live unless they like. Nevertheless, With swords and daggers hanging at their sides, With drowning seas and rivers at their feet, With deadly poisons in their very grasp, Men live, and liveâand seem to like to live! Darine. How strangely inconsistent! Selene. Not at all. With all their miseryâwith all the sinâ With all the elements of wretchedness That teem on that unholy world of theirs, They have one great and ever-glorious gift That compensates for all they have to bear! Song.âSelene. With all the misery, with all the shame That stain the earth, One holy influence these mortals claimâ A gift of priceless worth! The gift of Loveâshield against deadly foes That crowd in serried shoalsâ A Love that's anodyne to all the woes That wring their souls! Oh, kindly Love! Man sorrowing and oppressed, Beneath his load of shame would surely fall, But for the sweet enchantment in his breast That tells him that he bears no load at all! In its most pure and most enduring form It knows no end; To deed of shame or stress of worldly storm Such love will never bend. Time cannot wither it, nor Death destroy; When the relentless Thief Has robbed it of the power to live on joy, It lives on grief! Oh, wondrous Loveâpure as the silver sky! Even when Death has set the loved one free, This love supernal doth notâcannot die; It lives upon the loved one's memory! [During this song, the Fairies, who at the commencement were scattered over the stage, have very gradually crept nearer and nearer to her, until, at the finish, they are grouped closely around her. Darine. Why, what have we in all our Fairyland To bear comparison with such a gift! Zayda. Oh for one hour of such a love as that, O'er all things paramount! Why, after all, That wicked world is the true Fairyland! Zara. Why, who can wonder that poor, erring Man Clings to the world, all poisoned though it be, When on it grows this glorious antidote! Zayda. And may we never love as mortals love? Selene. No, that can never be. Of earthy things, This love of theirs ranks as the earthliest. We do not need it in our perfect land. Moreover, there's this gulf 'tween it and usâ Only a mortal can inspire such love, And mortal foot may never touch our land. Zayda. Butâis that so? Selene (surprised). Of course! Zayda. Yet I have heard That there's a half-forgotten law which says That, when a fairy quits his fairy home To visit earth, those whom he leaves behind May summon from that wicked world below That absent fairy's mortal counterpart, And that that mortal counterpart may stay In Fairyland and fill that fairy's place Till he return. Is there not some such law? Selene (horrified). And if there were, wouldst put that law in force? Zayda (frightened). No, not for all the love of all the world! Selene. A man in Fairyland! Oh, horrible! He would exhale the poison of his soul, And we should even be as mortals areâ Hating as man hates! Darine (enthusiastically). Loving as man loves! [Selene looks at her in blank surprise. Too horrible! Stillâ Selene. Well? Darine. I see a trace Of wisdom lurking in this ancient law. Selene. Where lurks that wisdom, then? I see it not! Duet.âDarine and Zayda. Darine. Man is a being all accuse Of every vice detestable: To virtue blinded, he pursues A course that's unarrestable. Yet if we let one man of shame Observe our lives immaculate, He would (returning whence he came) Ecstatically ejaculateâ âAtone, atone! Repent, repent! The pure alone Know true content!â These tidings good, No doubt, he would Ecstatically ejaculate! Chorus. The news would take the world by storm, And be received with welcome warm; Those words he would, in some such form, Ecstatically ejaculate! Zayda. Man is a brute, oppressed by strange Unintellectuality: Enlighten him, and you will change His normal immorality. If we exhibited to some Our course of life delectable, They might in course of time become Comparatively respectable! Oh, picture then Our joy sublime, If mortal men Became in timeâ Suppose we say, In guarded way, Comparatively respectable! Chorus. The news would take the world by storm, And be received with welcome warm, And all would be by this reform Comparatively respectable! Selene (reflectively). There is some truth in this. Zayda. Some truth indeed! Oh, terrible, dear sister, to reflect That to our cold and culpable neglect All mortal follies may be chargeable! Selene (surprised). To our neglect? Darine. It may in truth be so! Fleta. In very truth I'm sure that it is so! Selene (after a pause). It shall be so no more! Their sin is ours! But thereâ'tis easy still to make amends. A mortal shall behold our sinless state, And learn the beauties of our blameless life. Come, let us summon mortal Ethais! [All delighted. Darine. Butâ Selene. Not a wordâI am resolved to this! Darine. But, sisterâ Selene. Well? Darine (timidly). Why summon only one? Selene. Why summon more? Darine. The world's incredulous; Let two be summoned to our sinless home; Then should their wondrous story be received With ridicule or incredulity, One could corroborate the other. Zayda. Yes. Phyllon has gone with Ethaisâlet us call The mortal counterpart of Phyllon too! Selene. Two mortals! Two unhappy men of sin In this untainted spot! Locrine. Well, sister dear, Two Heralds of the Truth will spread that Truth At the least twice as rapidly as one! Selene. Two miserable men! Why, one alone Will bring enough pollution in his wake To taint our happy land from end to end! Zayda. Then, sister, two won't make the matter worse! Selene. There's truth in that! [After a pause. The two shall come to us! [All the Fairies are delighted. Selene looks reprovingly at them, and they at once become demure. (Severely) We have deserved this fearful punishment! [All the Fairies sigh. Our power, I think, is limited to two? Locrine. Unfortunately! Selene. Yes. More might be done Had each of us a pupil to herself. Scena.âSelene. And now to summon them. But, sisters dear, Receive our guests with gracious courtesies. Show no repugnance to them while they're here; Subdue your natural antipathies. Kind, gentle, tender, pitiful be yeâ Be not severe, nor hastily condemn. Treat them as though they were what they will be When they have seen what we shall be to them! All. We'll act as though they were what they will be When they have seen what we shall be to them! Selene. What form of words accomplishes our aim? Darine. Two roses shall be cast down from the skies, Then, as each rose is thrown, pronounce the name Of him whose mortal self it typifies. [Giving her two roses. Selene (taking them). Well then, fair rose, I name thee âEthaisââ Thy mortal counterpart we summon here. This rose is Phyllonâcome to our realms of bliss: By virtue of this talisman, appear! All. Go, then, fair rose. We name thee âEthaisââ Thy mortal counterpart we summon here. Sir Phyllon, in our realms of blameless bliss, By virtue of this talisman appear! [Hurried music. Sir Ethais and Sir Phyllon rise through the gap in the cloud, as though violently impelled from below. They are two handsome, barbaric Hunnish knights, clad in picturesque skins and rude armour, and while bearing a strong facial resemblance to their Fairy counterparts, present as strong a contrast as possible in their costume and demeanour. Their swords are drawn, the knights having been interrupted in a duel. The Fairies conceal themselves behind trees. Recit. and Duet.âSir Ethais and Sir Phyllon. Ethais. By god and man, who brought us here, and how? Phyllon. Where in the name of witchcraft are we now? Ethais (fiercely). Why, who should answer that as well as thou? Phyllon (surprised). As I? Ethais. Aye, devil's whelp, as thou! Duet.âSir Ethais and Sir Phyllon. Ethais (fiercely). This is some wizardry of thy design To save thy sconce! Thou scurvy dog, no sorcery of thine Shall serve e'en for the nonce! Let all thy hell-hounds howl their requiem, And when I've done with thee I'll do with them! Phyllon (savagely). Bah! I need no such devil-begotten stuff To flog a knave! This trusty falchion serves me well enough To make a coward crave! Though demons swarm in myriads round about, Or here or there we'll fight our quarrel out! [They fight. The Fairies, half concealed behind portions of the set, watch the combat with great interest. Darine. What are they doing? Selene. It's some game of skill. It's very pretty. Darine. Very. [Knights pause to take breath. Oh, they've stopped! Phyllon. Come, comeâon guard! Zayda. Now they begin again! [They fight. Ethais (seeing Fairies, who have gradually surrounded him). Hold, we are overlooked! [Ethais, who has turned for a moment in saying this, is severely wounded in the right arm. Selene. You may proceed. We like it much! Darine. You do it very well. Begin again! Ethais. Black curses on that thrust! I am disabled! Ladies, bind my woundâ And, if it please you still to see us fight, We'll fight for those bright eyes and cherry lips Till one or both of us shall bite the dust! Phyllon (aside to Ethais). Hold! Call a truce till we return to earthâ Here are bright eyes enough for both of us! Ethais. I don't know that! Well, there, till we returnâ [Shaking hands. But, once on earth again, we will take up Our argument where it was broken off, And let thy devils whirl me where they may We'll reach conclusion and corollary! [During this the Fairies show that they have been very strongly influenced by the two knights. Darine (gazing at Phyllon). Oh, fairyhood! How wonderfully like our Phyllon! Selene (gazing in rapture at Ethais). Yes! And seeâhow strangely like our Ethais! (Sighing.) Thou hast a gallant carriage, gentle knight! Ethais. It's little wonder that I'm like myself! Why I am he! Selene (sighing). No, not our Ethais! Ethais. In truth I am the Ethais of all Who are as gentle and as fair as thou! Selene (tenderly). That's bravely said! Thou hast a silver tongue! Why, what can gods be like if these be men? [During this Darine, Zayda, Locrine, and other Fairies show, by their manner, that they take a tender interest in Ethais and Phyllon. Say, dost thou come from earth or heaven? Ethais (gallantly placing his arm round Selene and Darine). I think I've come from earth to heaven! Selene (delightedly to Zayda). Oh, didst thou hear? He comes from earth to heaven! No, Ethais, We are but fairies: this, our native homeâ Our fairylandârests on a cloud which floats Hither and thither as the breezes will. We see the world; yet, saving that it is A very wicked world, we know it not. But on the lands o'er which our island hangs We shed fair gifts of plently and good-will, Drop tears of love upon the thirsty earth And shower fair water on the growing grain. This is our mission. Phyllon. 'Tis a goodly one! But tell me nowâwhy have you summoned us? Selene. Because we seek to teach you solemn truths That now ye wot not of, poor gentlemen! (Tenderly.) Poor gentlemen! Poor wayward gentlemen! Song.âSelene. Poor, purblind, untaught youths, We seek to teach ye truths Which now ye wot not of, as we suppose! Our aid ye sorely need, For ye are frail indeedâ Each a poor fragile reed Swayed to and fro by every breeze that blows! [Taking his hand and stroking it tenderly. And we are good and pure, Safe from temptation's lure. (There are no tempters to disturb our rest!) Unknown the fierce delights That lure attractive knights Into disastrous plights! (Aside to Zayda.) They are attractive, it must be confessed! All. Though worldly passions animate each breast, They are attractive, it must be confessed! Selene. Poor maidens to deceive A potent spell ye weave, To which those all-too-willing victims yield! [Kissing his hand. We fairies hope to show The ills that from it flow, And teach you to forego The marvellous enchantment that ye wield. [Gently stroking his face. Homeward returning then, Pure, simple, guileless men, Warn all poor maids with whom ye are in touch (Would they live free from harm) To shun, in wild alarm, Your strange mysterious charm! (Aside to Zayda, sighing.) The maids may shun it, but I doubt it much. All. Would ye escape the plights That spring from love's delights, Shun all attractive knights! (Aside to each other, sighing.) The maids may do so, but I doubt it much! [During Selene's song and the chorus, Darine, Zayda, and others have been dealing tenderly with Phyllon. All show that they are deeply impressed by the two knights. Ensemble.âSir Ethais and Sir Phyllon (nudging each other). Phyllon. With keen remorse We tell you penitentially, Our lives are coarse And villainous essentiallyâ But bred and born In pagan Principality, We view with scorn Our former immorality. Ethais. Of blameless state We've hope infinitesimal (We calculate Its value to a decimal), Unless at once You give, experimentally, Each wayward dunce A polish-up, parentally! Phyllon (to Ethais). This humble pie Is but a tough comestible Which he and I Find rather indigestible! Ethais (to Selene). That's just his wayâ An ill-bred Oriental man. Forgive him, prayâ Of course he's not a gentleman! Phyllon. My penitence Perhaps is unconventional. Ethais (to Selene). Don't take offenceâ I'm sure it's unintentional. Both. We both are bound For fairy course probational; So pray expound Your system educational! Trio.âDarine, Zayda, and Locrine. Oh, gentle knights, with joy elate, We'll teach you to abjure All earthly dross, and cultivate The blameless and the pure! Be docile pupils in our school, While we, with earnest heart, Of all that's good and beautiful The principles impart! Recit.âSelene. If my obedient pupils you would be, You must avow your loyalty to me. No doubt you recognize Some formula, word-wise, That binds your heart in solemn fealty? Couplets.âSir Ethais and Selene. Ethais. When homage to his Queen a subject shows (A Queen that's duly crowned), He puts his arm around That monarch's waistâlike this, [Doing so. And plants a very long and tender kiss Sometimes upon her cheeks of creamy rose, But, preferably, just below the nose! Chorus. There is some reasonâso we must supposeâ Why preferably, just below the nose? Phyllon. A still more binding process I propose: For though no doubt it's true One formal kiss might do, Administered like this, [Kissing Darine on cheek. The pledge works more effectively, I wis, When several dozen kisses he bestowsâ Placed preferably just below the nose! Chorus. I hope he'll tell us all before he goes Why preferably just below the nose? Darine (aside to Selene). A simple kiss a simple friendship shows. 'Tis an insipid thing That no delight can bring, Placed on the browâlike this. [Kisses Selene's brow. Yet on these gentle knights' hypothesis Some unexpected virtue 'twill disclose, Placed preferably just below the nose! Chorus. Some explanation certainly he owesâ Why preferably just below the nose? Selene. Our outlook widens as experience grows. That form is quite unknown In our ethereal zoneâ A kiss is but a kiss. Yet if these knights be surely bound by this, There is no need to ask them to disclose Why preferably just below the nose? Chorus. Still there's some reasonâso we must supposeâ Why preferably just below the nose. Selene. That form is not in vogue in Fairyland. Still, as it holds on earth, no doubt 'twill have Far greater weight with you, poor sons of earth, Than any formula we could impose. Ethais. Its weight is overpowering! [About to kiss her. Selene. But stayâ We would not wrest this homage from you, sir. Or give it willingly, or not at all. Phyllon. Most willingly, fair Queen, we give to you! Selene. Goodâthen proceed. [Sir Ethais kisses Selene. Sir Phyllon kisses Darine. Ethais. Thereâdoes it not convey A pleasant sense of influence? Selene. It does. (To Darine.) Some earthly forms seem rational enough! [Sir Ethais staggers as though about to faint. Why, Ethais, what ails thee? Ethais. Nothing graveâ I'm weak from loss of blood. Here, take this scarf, And bind it round my armâsoâhave a care! There, that will do till I return to earth, Then Lutin, who's a very skilful leech, Shall doctor it. Selene (amazed). Didst thou say Lutin? Ethais. Yes. Darine. How strange. Sir Ethais has a Lutin too! Lutin has entered unobserved. Ethais. Yes, he's my squireâa poor half-witted churl, Who shudders at the rustling of a leaf. He hath a potion that will heal my wound, A draught whose power works instantaneously. Were he here I should soonâ [Sees Fairy Lutin, who has entered unobserved. Why, here he is! By all the gods, pranked out in masquerade! (To Lutin.) Give me the potion! Lutin (in amazement). Give thee what? Ethais (impatiently). The draught! Dost thou not see my wound? Lutin (contemptuously). I have no draught! Ethais. Thou scurvy rogue, I bade thee never leave thy home without it! Thy hide shall pay! Lutin. Who is this insolent? A mortal here in Fairyland? Locrine. Yesâtwo! Lutin. Who are these men? Selene. The mortal counterparts Of Ethais and Phyllon. Look at them! Dost thou not love them? Lutin (indignantly). No! Cora. How very strange! Why, we all loved them from the very first! Lutin. Is this indeed the truth? Darine (demurely). It is indeed. Obedient to our Queen's command, we have Subdued our natural antipathies. [Fondling Phyllon. Zayda (demurely). They are our guests, all odious though they be, And we must bid them welcome to our home, As though e'en now they were what they will be When they have seen what we shall be to them. [Fondling Phyllon. Lutin. Be warned in time and send these mortals hence! Why, don't you see that in each word they speak They breathe of Love? Selene (enthusiastically). They do! Lutin. Why, Love's the germ Of every sin that stalks upon the earth! Song.âLutin. The warrior, girt in shining might, Knows, as he bares his sword, That, should he murderously fight, And cut and thrust and slash and smite (No matter wrong, no matter right), Love will be his reward. The footpad nerves his coward arm With draughts of mead and mull, And stupefies his soul's alarm, And all his stealthy dread of harm, By pondering on the tipsy charm Of some poor tavern trull! Oh, Love's the source of every ill! Compounded with unholy skill, It proves, disguise it as you will, A gilded but a poisoned pill! Love instigates the brawler bold; For love the lover lies; The miser hoards ill-gotten gold To buy the prize, so lightly sold, That looks so warm yet burns so coldâ The love of two bright eyes! For lawless love the wife elopes, And blights her husband's lot; For love denied the moper mopes, To toast his love the toper topes, With heavy heart the hoper hopes For love that loves him not! Oh, Love's a poison foul and fleet, Nor is its horror less complete Because, with devil-born deceit, It looks so fair and tastes so sweet! Recitative. Zayda (to Ethais). Nay, heed him not! A tale has reached our ears That man is infamous in high degree, And he believes itâso indeed did we, Till we beheld you, gallant cavaliers! Darine (to Selene). Send him to earthâthen we can summon here His mortal counterpart! [Selene looks at her reprovingly. Darine changes her tone. Another reed No doubt who stands in very sorest need Of virtuous counselling and guidance clear! Selene. Well said, Darine! Thy words are words of worth. Lutin, begone at once! Ethais. Return to earth! Insolent varlet, get thee quickly hence! Lutin. Oh, mortal plague! Oh, walking pestilence! Listen and learn, Oh, incarnation of uncleanliness! Song.âLutin. Hark ye, you sir! On yonder ball You've Kings and Queens to whom you fall, And humbly cringe and creep and crawl, Cast dust and ashes too your head upon, That they some civil word may say to you. Well, sir, there's not a King on earth, There's not a Prince of royal birth, Who would not barter all he's worth To lick the very dust I tread uponâ And I'm the meanest here! Good day to you! [Lutin goes up stage and prepares to descend. Chorus. Good day, to youâ Away, to youâ That's all we have to say to you. Don't stay, to youâ Delay, to youâ Don't hurry back, we pray to you. Away, to youâ Good day to youâ Away! Good day! [Lutin descends. The Fairies then turn to Sir Ethais and Sir Phyllon. Ensemble. Fairies. Oh, gallant gentlemen, You see our plight; Take pity on us, then, And give us light! Our prayerâah! do not spurnâ This we beseech: We brought you here to learnâ Stay ye to teach! We foolish fairies thought Your guides to be, But we are all untaught, As ye may see. Oh, gallant gentlemen, You see our plight, Take pity on us, then, And give us light! Take pity on us, list to our appeal As humble suppliants at your feet we kneel! Oh, grant this prayer, all other prayers above: Teach us, oh, gallant gentlemen, to love! Ethais and Phyllon to each other. As gallant gentlemen, We see their plight; We will take pity, then, And give them light! Their prayer we will not spurn, So they beseech: They brought us here to learnâ We'll stay to teach! These foolish fairies thought Our guides to be, But they are all untaught, As we may see. As gallant gentlemen, (to Fairies) We seek your plight; We will take pity, then, And give you light! In pity, then, we list to your appeal As humble suppliants at our feet you kneel! We'll grant your prayer, all other prayers above, And show how gallant gentlemen can love. [Some of the Fairies kneel at the feet of the knights, Selene embracing Sir Ethais; Darine, Zayda, and Lochrine hanging on Sir Phyllon's neck. The remaining Fairies are grouped in attitudes of entreaty at the feet of the two knights.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Locrine. Oh, world below! Oh, wicked world, Where sin and woe Lie all unfurled! Oh, world of shame, Of guilt and greed, Where joy in name Is woe indeed! May angels' tears be shed on thee, Thou wicked world of misery! [As Locrine sings, Fairies enter from different approaches and fill the stage, Neodie, Zayda, Cora, Lila, and others leading them. Enter Darine. Solo. Darine. Oh, picture to thyself a mortal crew Sinning throughout their lives, as demons do! Fierce wild barbaric shapes, all foul withinâ Howling with hunger for more sinâmore sin! Fierce wild barbaric shapes, All head and tail; Some like red raving apes, Some clad in scale; Others like dead-fleshed ghouls With horny eyes, Squatting on black toadstools Of monstrous size! All of them foul without and foul within; All glimmering in the lurid light of sin! Chorus. All of them foul without and foul within; All glimmering in the lurid light of sin! Neodie (recit.). Selene comes; as silvery moon serene, Radiant with loveliness, our sister-Queen! Enter Selene. Chorus. Pure as the air, sweet as the morning dew, Cometh our Queen! Bright in all eyes as Heaven's ethereal blue, Cometh our Queen! Spirit of love! as thou hast ever been, Be to us evermore, oh sister-Queen! Unsullied source Of tranquil joy, Pursue thy course Of pure employâ Be thou, as thou hast ever been, Our all-beloved sister-Queen!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Same scene by moonlight. The Fairies, all but Selene and Darine, are discovered discontentedly watching the entrance to Selene's bower. Chorus. For many an hour Within her bower With Ethais philandering, Our excellent Queen No doubt has been In roseate dreams meandering. As a matter of fact A risky act, So obviously detectableâ So very unfit We must admit Is anything but respectable! A Fairy Queen who dares conventionality despise, To put it very mildly, is exceedingly unwise. Here is an act to which we cannot close our eyes, And must excite our indignation and surprise. Fleta (dialogue). Still, still Selene watches Ethais! For six long hours has she detained the knight Within the dark recesses of her bower, Under pretence that his unhappy wound Demands her unremitting watchfulness! Locrine. This, fairies, is our Queenâthe sinless soul To whose immaculate pre-eminence We, pure and perfect maidens of the air, Accord our voluntary reverence! She is unfit to rule us as our Queen! Zayda. Her conduct is an outrage on her sex! Was it for this that we proposed to her To bring these erring mortals to our land? Is this the way to teach a sinful man The moral beauties of a spotless life? Surely this knight might well have learnt on earth Such mortal truths as she is teaching him! Song.âZayda. I never profess to make a guessâ That smacks of perspicacityâ Prophetical flight, my dears, is quite A cut above my capacity; But such a barefaced display of taste For military society, The veriest dunce would deem at once A horrible impropriety! Chorus. A horrible impropriety! Zayda. I always view The acts unwise My sisters do With kindly eyes. But, truth to tell, Such conductâwell, It smacks of impropriety! Chorus. It smacks of impropriety! Zayda. Though it seems odd, And may offend, To kiss the rod I don't intend. Chorus. It wrong I call To kiss at all! Zayda. A capital rule of life, my friend! Zayda. Was it for this to realms of bliss We summoned such rascality? Is this the way to teach him, pray, The truths of pure morality? With wiles demure his love she'll lure, Caressing and beseeching him! No need to journey here to learn Such truths as she is teaching him! Chorus. Such truths as she is teaching him! Zayda. Though sure we are That every youth Should travel far To learn the truth, Ile might, with care, Have learnt, down there, Such truths as she is teaching him! Chorus. Such truths as she is teaching him! Zayda. You do not think Me too severe? We should not wink At faults, it's clearâ Chorus. We should not wink At all, I think. Zayda. A capital rule of life, my dear! Enter Selene from bower. Fleta (aside). At last she comes. (To Selene.) We are relieved to find That after such a lengthy vigil thou Canst tear thyself away from Ethais! Selene. Yes, he is sleeping now, but all day long He tossed and raved in wild delirium, Shouting for arms, and, as it seemed to me, Fighting his fight with Phyllon o'er again. I watched him through the long and troubled hours, Fanning the fever from his throbbing brow Till he awoke. At first he gazed on me In silent wonderment; then, suddenly, Seizing my hand, he pressed it to his lips And vowed that I had saved him from the grave! Mark thatâthe grave! IâI had saved his life! He told me that he loved meâloved me wellâ That I had holy angel-eyes that rained A gentle pity on his stubborn heartâ That I was fairer in his worldly eyes Than all the maids on earth or in the clouds! Zayda (spitefully). Could any words more eloquently show The reckless of his delirium? Selene (surprised). Nay, he was conscious then. Fleta (very sweetly). No doubt he was. But, sister, in thy triumph recollect He scarce had seen us. Zayda. Thou hast wisely done To keep us out of sight. Cage thou thy bird Or he may fly to fairer homes than thine! Selene (amazed). What mean you, sisters? Nay, turn not away! What have I done? Locrine (spitefully). Indeed we do not know; But, lest we should affect his love for thee, We will at once withdraw! [Exit Locrine curtesying ironically. Leila (politely). Good night to you! [Exit curtesying. Neodie. Good night! [Exit curtesying. Zayda. Good night! Remember, cage thy bird! [Exeunt all curtesying. Selene. How strangely are my sisters changed to me! Have I done wrong? No, no, I'm sure of that! The knight was sorely strickenâhe had died But for my willing care! Oh, earthly Love, Thou mighty monarch, holding in thy grasp The holiest balm and most enduring woe, Is it for good or ill that thou art here? Ethais has entered unperceived from the bower. He is very pale and weak, and his arm is in a sling. Ethais. Selene, I am weak; give me thine hand. [She goes to him. Selene. My love, thou shouldst not yet have left thy couch. Come, thou hast need of rest. Ethais. No, let me stay. The air revives me; I am strong again. And so thou trustest me? Selene. In truth I do. Although I cannot tell thee whence proceeds This strange, irrational belief in theeâ Thee, whom I hardly know! Ethais. I see no marvel! Selene. Nay, my loveâreflect: I am a woman, and thou art a man. Well, thou art comelyâso, in truth, am I. We meet and love each otherâthat's to say, I am prepared to give up all I have, My home, my very fairyhood for theeâ Thou to surrender riches, honour, life, To please the fleeting fancies of my will. And why? Because I see in thee, or thou in me, Astounding virtue, brilliant intellect, Great self-denial, venerable years, Rare scholarship or shining godliness? No! Because, forsooth, we're comely specimens, Not of our own, but Nature's industry! Ballad.âSelene. Thy features are fair and seemlyâ A god among mortal men: I'm beautiful, too, extremelyâ Granting all this, what then? The cause is beyond my ken. I blindly thus reply: âSuppose we were fated To be separated, Assuredly I should die!â Oh, thine is the giving Of dying or living! I wonder, wonder why? Selene and Ethais. The cause is beyond our ken, etc. A being of radiance rarer Is the Sun in his golden noon; Beyond comparison fairer The sheen of the silver Moon. Each is a God-sent boon, Fairer than you or Iâ But when they've departed I'm not broken-hearted, I neither despair nor die! The act of their setting I see without frettingâ I wonder, wonder why! Selene and Ethais. The cause is beyond our ken, etc. Ethais. I'll satisfy thy wonder in a word: The face is the true index to the heartâ A ready formula whereby to read The morals of a mortal at a glance. Selene. Then, Ethais, is perfect comeliness Always identified with moral worth? Ethais. The comeliest man is the most virtuo us. That's an unfailing rule. Selene. Then, Ethais, There is no holier man on earth than thou! Take thou this ringâit is a pledge of loveâ [Giving him a ring. Wear it until thy love fades from thy soul. Ethais. 'Twill never fade while thou art true to me. Selene (amazed). Are women ever false to such as thou? Ethais. Are women ever true?âwell, not to me! Selene. But these are earthly maidens, Ethais. My love is purer than a mortal's love. Ethais. Thine is no mortal love if it be pure. Selene (horrified). Then, mortal Ethais, what love is thine? Ethais. (taken back). I spake of womenâmen are otherwise! Selene. Man's love is pure invariably? Ethais. Pure? Pure as thine own! Selene. Poor trusting, cheated souls! Song.âSir Ethais. When a knight loves ladyeâ (Hey, but a maid is a sorry little jade!) He sighs and he sings lackadaydyâ Hey, lackadaydy, O! Of a love life-long He'll sing a songâ (Hey, but a maid is a sorry little jade!) Of a love supreme He dreams a dreamâ Hey, lackadaydy, O! And little recks he in his love-lorn soul That, ere by and by, will the tocsin tollâ Ding dong! Ding dong! Hey, lackadaydy, O! When a maid grows wearyâ (Hey, but a maid is a sorry little jade!) O sad his heart and drearyâ Hey, lackadaydy, O! Then day by day He wilts awayâ (Hey, but a maid is a sorry little jade!) With one sad sigh He droops to dieâ Hey, lackadaydy, O! Her love his lifeâboth yield their due, And the tocsin tolling tolls for two! Ding dong! Ding dong! Hey, lackadaydy, O! [Exeunt Ethais and Selene together into her bower as Darine, who has been watching them, enters. Darine. She leads him willingly into her bower! Oh, I could curse the eyes that meet his eyes, The hand that touches his hands, and the lips That press his lips! And why? I cannot tell! Some unknown fury rages in my heartâ A mean and miserable hate of all Who interpose between my love and me! What devil doth possess me? Phyllon has entered unobserved during the last few lines. Phyllon (coming forward). Jealousy! Darine (recklessly). Maybe! What matters how the fiend is called! Phyllon. But wherefore art thou jealous? Tell me now, Have I done aught to cause this jealousy? Darine. Thou? Dost thou love me? Phyllon (airily). Love thee? Tenderly I love all pretty girls on principle. Darine (impetuously). But is thy love an all-possessing love? Mad, reckless, unrestrained, infuriate? Holding thy heart within its steely grasp, And pressing passion from its very core? Phyllon (surprised). That sort of thing! Darine (pityingly). Alas, poor stricken knight! Phyllon, my love is such a love as thine; But it is not for thee! Oh, steel thyself To hear disastrous tidings, gentle knight! (Melodramatically.) I love thee not! Phyllon (coolly). Indeed? Darine. Is it not strange? Phyllon (very quietly). Most unaccountable! Darine (disappointed). But tell me now, Art thou not sorely grieved? Phyllon (very calmly). Unspeakably. Darine. But dost thou understand? I love thee not; I, whom thou lovest, Phyllon, love thee not! Nay, more, I love anotherâEthais! Thou hast a rival, and a favoured oneâ Dost thou not hear me? Phyllon (calmly). Yes, I am deeply pained. Darine (delighted). Thou art? Phyllon. Of courseâwhat wouldst thou have me do? Darine. Do? Hurl thyself headlong to yonder earth, And end at once a life of agony! Phyllon. Why should I? Darine. Why? Because I love thee not! Why, if I loved and found my love despised, The universe should ring with my laments; And were I mortal, Phyllon, as thou art, I would destroy myself! [Phyllon is greatly amused. Duet.âDarine and Phyllon. Darine. But dost thou hear? I love thee not! Phyllon (indifferently). Oh, yes, you put it clearly. Darine. A favoured rival thou hast got! Phyllon. I envy him sincerely! Darine. And canst thou contemplate Darine With Ethais fondly toyingâ In fond caress and rapture keen, His social charm enjoying? Unhappy Phyllon, think of this: These eyesâthey burn for Ethais; These lipsâwhich thou shalt never kiss; This formâdesigned to crown his bliss! Phyllon. Well, it's annoying! Darine (anxiously). It is annoying? Phyllon. Yes, it's annoying! Ensemble. These eyesâthey burn for Ethais, &amp;c. Phyllon. The state of your emotions you Delineate succinctly: But, comeâwhat would you have me do? Tell me the truth distinctly. Darine. Do? Hurl thyself to yonder earth, With sorrow unabated, And end a life from hour of birth To bitter anguish fated! Phyllon. I see your point, but (pardon me) Did all heart-broken youths agree In death to drown their miseree, The world within a week would be Depopulated! Darine. Depopulated? Phyllon. Depopulated! Ensemble. Phyllon. Undoubtedly; but (pardon me) Did all heart-broken youths agree In death to drown their miseree, The world within a week would be Depopulated! Darine. His difficulty I can see; Did all heart-broken youths agree In death to drown their miseree, The world within a week would be Depopulated! [Exit Phyllon. Darine (looking off). Here comes the miserable, mincing jade, With a fair speech upon her lying lips, To meet the sister whom her evil arts Have robbed of more than life. Oh, hypocrite! Enter Selene. Selene. Darine! Darine (changing her manner). My sisterâmy beloved one! Why, thou art sad; thine eyes are dim with tears. Say, what has brought thee grief? Selene (with joy). Darine, my own! Thou dost not shun me, then? Darine. Shun thee, my sweet Selene? No, not I! Selene. Bless thee for that! I feared to meet thy face, For all my loved companions turned from me With scornful jest and bitter mockery; Thou, thou, Darine, alone art true to me! Darine. True to Selene while Selene breathes! Come, tell me all thy woes. Selene. My Ethaisâ He whom I love so fondlyâhe is ill, And I am powerless to heal his wound! Darine, my love may die! Darine (wildly). What can be done? Oh, I would give my fairyhood to save The man thou lovest, oh, my dearly loved! But stayâthe counterpart of Lutin is At once his henchman and his cunning leech: Lutin has gone to earthâcast thou this flower And summon mortal Lutin to his aid; He hath a charm to heal thy lover's wound! Selene. Kind Heaven reward thee for thy ready wit! My sister, thou hast saved both him and meâ My darling sister! [Embracing her. Darine (aside). Oh, thou hypocrite! Selene. Fair rose, I name thee Lutinâgo to earth And hither send the mortal counterpart Of him whose name thou hast, and may kind Heaven Prosper thy mission! Kiss me, dear Darine, For thou hast saved my Ethais for me! [Kisses her and exit. Darine. No, not for thee, good sisterâfor myself! [Exit Darine. Hurried music. Enter mortal Lutin over the edge of the cloud, staggering on to the stage as though violently impelled from below. Lutin (bewildered). Help! help! help! Whatever has become of me? Help! help! help! Wherever am I now? Help! help! help! Who's made a tee-to-tum of me? When came I here, why came I here, whence came I here, and how? Uprising with velocity This impolite atrocity Excites my curiosityâ But stay, I'm coming toâ But stay, I'm coming toâ But stay, I'm coming toâ I've gained my senses! I've died a death deplorable, For ever unrestorable, And left my wife adorable To weep, and pay my fu- To weep, and pay my fu- To weep, and pay my fu- neral expenses! Ha! Ha! Ha! Whatever has become of me? &amp;c. During this the Fairies have entered, led by Zayda, Locrine, Neodie, Fleta, and others. They examine him curiously and with much amusement. Zayda. A freak of Natureânot of Art! 'Tis Lutin, without wing! Fleta. His likeness to his counterpart Is most astonishing! Leila. How beautifully formed is heâ How delicately quaint! Zara. I wonder will he prove to be A sinner or a saint? Chorus. We wonder will he prove to be A sinner or a saint? We lay no stress On blamelessness, But still we wait To speculate On thisâwill he Turn out to be A sinner or a saint? Lutin (who has been much impressed with the beauty of the Fairies). Though I'm no Mussulman, it's true, Yet by some strange device My soul has found its way into Mahomet's Paradise! If this is all I have to pay For my career perverse, It might have been, I'm bound to say, Considerably worse! Considering, I've had my fling, 'Tis very well; For, truth to tell, From what I glean, It might have been Considerably worse! Chorus. Considering He's had his fling, 'Tis very well; For, truth to tell, From what we glean, It might have been Considerably worse! [Exit Zayda. Locrine (entering). Why, this is Lutin's mortal counterpart! How quaint! How picturesquely rugged! Leila Yes! Such character and such expression! All (admiring him). Yes! Lutin (with conviction). It's Paradise! Mahomet's Paradise! I'm comfortably dead, and all is well! Neodie. Alas! This is not Paradise, nor art thou dead, Thou art in Fairyland! These are the clouds, And there's the earth from which we summoned thee. Lutin. Of course! I recollect it all! A mist Enveloped me and whirled me safely here Just as my fair but able-bodied wife Began to lay my staff about my ears. That's all I know. I'm much obliged to it! Neodie. Oh, tell me, are there many men on earth As fair and pleasant to the eye as thou? Lutin. Not manyâthough I have met one or two Who run me pretty close! Locrine. Tell us their names. Lutin. Well, let me seeâSir Phyllon has been thought A personable man; then Ethaisâ He's fairly well. Neodie. But these are handsome men. We love thee for thy rugged, homely face; Oh, we are sated with mere comeliness, We have so much of that up here! I love A homely face! Lutin. I quite agree with you! What do a dozen handsome men imply? A dozen faces, cast in the same mould. A dozen mouths, all lip for lip the same, A dozen noses, all of equal length. But take twelve plain men, and the element Of picturesque variety steps in. You get at once unlooked for hill and dale, Odd curves and unexpected points of light, Pleasant surprises, quaintly broken linesâ All very charming, whether seen upon The face of Nature or the face of Man. Song.âLutin. Suppose you take, with open mind, Twelve handsome menâwhat do you find? Twelve people, twenty-five years old, Twelve shapes, in even series; Twelve faces, cast in classic mould (A type that quickly wearies); Twelve headsâthe same from crown to nape, In tedious iteration; Twelve nosesâall alike in shape, Without a variation; Two dozen eyesâall large and bright; Two dozen lipsâall modelled quite Like Cupid's bowâand underneath Somewhere about three hundred teeth, By average calculation. This is a principle you may disseminate: Good-looking men are effete and effeminate. As for variety, they haven't got anyâ Morbidly mild in their mawky monotony! But take twelve plain men, and you find Variety of every kind! You've eyes that swivelâeyes that squint, And dribbling eyes, and dozy; And mottled cheeks of every tint, And hair that's red and rosy; You've mouths that grin and mouths that gape; Large ears that don't offend us; Uneven teeth grotesque in shape, And noses, tooâtremendous! You've noses flat and noses snub, Gigantic noses, noses club; You've noses long and noses short, And some that snore and some that snort With energy stupendous! Why we're unpopular passes the wit o' me! Each of his kind is a comic epitome, Teeming with humours of dissimilarityâ Quite a museum of peculiarity! Enter Zayda unobserved. Locrine. But stay! Thou shouldst be faint for lack of foodâ Neodie. Nay, let me minister unto his needsâ Zayda (coming forward). Then go, beloved sisters. Gather fruits And bring them here to him. Such frugal fare Will have a daintier flavour than its own When served by such fair hands! [Exeunt Locrine, Neodie, and the others. Zayda (changing her manner). We are alone! One word of cautionâshun my sisters all! Lutin. Are all these lovely girls your sisters? Zayda. All! Rejoice that they are not thine own. Lutin. I do. I very much prefer them as they are! You're a fine family. Zayda. Fair to the eye, But take good heedâthey are not what they seem! Locrine, the fairâthe beautiful Locrineâ Is the embodiment of avarice; Darine is vain beyond comparison; Neodie is much older than she looks; Camilla hath defective intellect; Maia's a bitter shrew, Colombe's a thief; And, last and worst of all, I blush to own, Our Queen Selene hath a tongue that stabsâ A traitor tongue that serves no better end Than wag a woman's character away! Lutin. I've stumbled into pretty company! It seems you fairies have your faults. Zayda. Alas! All but myself. My soul is in my face; I, only I, am what I seem to be; I, only I, am worthy of esteem. If thou wilt love me, I will dower thee With wealth untold, long years and happy life, Thou gallant churl, thou highly favoured boor, Thou pleasant knave, thou strange epitome Of all that's rugged, quaint, and picturesque! [Kissing him on the tip of his nose. Lutin. You don't take long in coming to the point! Zayda. Forgive my clumsy and ill-chosen words; We gentle, simple fairies never loved Until to-day. Lutin. And when you do begin, You fairies make up for the time you've lost! [Twelve Fairies enter with fruit and wine. He sits and they group round him as he eats and drinks. Neodie. Hast thou a wife? Lutin. Well, yesâthat is down there! Up here, I am a bachelorâas yet. Cora. And does she love thee? Lutin. Wellâwe do fall out. We did to-day. Neodie. And how came that about? Lutin. Why thus, to tell the truth, between ourselvesâ (Whispering.) There was a lady in the case! Zayda (much shocked). Hush, hush! Such stories are unfit for maiden's ears. Confine thyself to matters that relate To thine own sex. Thy master Ethais, He fought with Phyllon. What was that about? Lutin. Oh, it's the old, old story! Locrine. Tell it! Lutin. Well, There was a lady in the case! Zayda (shocked). Then stopâ Go on to something else. Where wast thou born? Lutin. Why in Bulgariaâsome years ago! (Whispering.) There was a lady in that case! Zayda (severely). It seems There is a lady, sir, in every case! Lutin. In all those cases they do interfere! [Exit Zayda, offended. Song.âLutin. In yonder world, which devils strew With worry, grief, and pain in plenty, This maxim is accounted true With nemine dissentiente: A woman doth the mischief brew In nineteen cases out of twenty! Chorus. A woman doth the mischief brew, In nineteen cases out of twenty! [Lutin] In all the woes That joy displace, In all the blows That bring disgrace On much enduring human race, There is a lady in the case! Yes, that's the fix We have to faceâ Her whims and tricks Throughout you trace. In all the woes that curse our race There is a lady in the case. Chorus. Yes, that's the fix They have to face, etc. [Lutin] If woman from great Nature's scheme Were utterly eliminated, Unruffled peace would reign supreme, No quarrels would be propagated. But that is a Utopian dream Of mortals unsophisticated. Chorus. But that is a Utopian dream Of mortals unsophisticated! [Lutin] It's true that foes Might then embrace, And earthly woes Dissolve apace. But where would be the human race With never a lady in the case? Yes, that's the rub We have to faceâ It gives a snub That kills the case. What would become of all our race With never a lady in the case? Chorus. Yes, that's the rub That kills their case, etc. Enter Darine, unobserved. Locrine. And, Lutin, is thy wife as fair as thou? Lutin. I thought her pretty till I looked on thee. Zayda. Her hairâ Lutin. Is bright, but not as bright as thine. Locrine. Her figure? Lutin. Neat and graceful of its kind, But lacks thy pleasant plumpness. Then besides She has a long, loud tongue, and uses it; A stout and heavy hand, and uses that; And large expressive eyes, and uses them! Zayda. And doth she know that thou art here with us? Lutin. No, that's the joke! Zayda. The joke? Lutin. Of course it is! Zayda. What joke? Lutin. What joke? Why this: my lovely wife Is just as full of devil-born jealousy As woman's soul can hold! A pretty girl Who comes within a hundred yards of me Runs a fair chance to lose both eyes and hair! If I address a well-proportioned maid, My bones will ache for it a month at least! Only the crooked, the palsied, and the blear Are held to be fit company for me, And even they must mind their p's and q's. This comes of being quaintly picturesque! Neodie (sighing). I understandâI'm not at all surprised. I should be just the same were I thy wife! Locrine. And how's the lady called? Lutin. Her name's Darine. Locrine (astonished). Darine? Lutin. Darine. All. How marvellous! Darine! Lutin. Why, what's the matter with the name? All. Darine! Darine, who has entered, comes forward. Darine. At last I've found thee, Lutin! Everywhere I've sought thee, high and low! Lutin (who stares at her in blank astonishment). Merciful powers! Are all my senses muddled, or is this A drink-engendered dream? Darine. A dream? Oh, no! Lutin (staring incredulously). Art thou indeed Darine? Darine. Darine indeed! Come hither, I would have a word with thee. Lutin (to Fairies). You'd better go! There's going to be a scene. [Fairies retire up. (In great terror.) Darine, have mercy! Pray let me explain, These bold young girls, they are no friends of mine! Nay, hear me patientlyâI know them not; They thrust themselves upon me 'gainst my will! (Crying.) Be merciful and hear before you strike! Darine. I have no time to list to explanations. Attend to me, for this is life or death! Thy master Ethaisâhe fought with Phyllon And he was sorely wounded in the fightâ Lutin. My master Ethais? Is he in the clouds? Darine. He is; his wound is grave and he may die! Thou hast a charm of wondrous efficacy (So Ethais says) to heal e'en mortal woundsâ I bid thee give it me without delay! Lutin. But tell me firstâwhat means this strange disguise? How camest thou up here? And, above all, Why dost thou want to heal his wound thyself? Darine. Why? Dost thou love thy master Ethais? Lutin. Of course I do. What then? Darine (passionately). Why, so do I! [Lutin horrified. Fiercely, unreasonably, recklessly! With all the madcap torrent of a soul That love has never kindled till to-day! Lutin (aghast). Thou lovest Ethais? Great heaven and earth! Is the girl mad? Darine. She is! Mad as the moon! Hast thou no pity for a heart-wrung girl Who pines for love that thou canst help her win? Lutin. She must be mad! Oh, my beloved Darine! [Throwing himself at her feet. Don't break my heartâdon't make my life a curse! I've been a faithful husbandâmore or less! And when I've earned a hearty cudgelling As I have, now and then, I've borne it meekly! Oh, Darine, my love, Do not forsake me. Treat me as thou wilt, I will bear all. Be thou but true to me, My masterful but well-beloved wife! [Weeping. Darine (astonished). I am thy wife? Thy well-beloved wife? Lutin. Of course! Darine. Oh monstrous! (Suddenly.) Stay! There has been mistake; Some dreadful error! See, I've found the clue! Her name's Darine. Here, set thy mind at restâ No doubt I am her fairy prototype! Lutin (sobbing). Her prototype? And what's a prototype? Darine. Why, all the mortals on that wicked world Have prototypes up here, and I am hersâ In face resembling her, and that is all. Lutin. Then you are not my wife? Darine. Not I indeed! Lutin. You're sure of that? Darine. Quite sure! Lutin (embracing her rapturously). My darling girl! And I'm permitted to disport myself With these fair maids? Darine. Undoubtedly you are! Lutin. Kiss me again! [Embracing her and giving her the phial. Hereâtake the phial. Two spoonsful to the dose! I never was so happy in my life! [Exit Darine triumphantly. Song.âLutin. When husband supposes His wife is a jade, No bed of red roses For husband is made; But when he discovers, His fears about lovers So grimly abhorrent Are quite without warrant, With utter contrition He sends to perdition All silly suspicionâ His fears are allayed; He, (Dancing.) Free from anxiety, Free from timidity, Ladies' society Seeks with avidityâ Pleasant variety, Perfect sobriety, No impropriety Or insipidity! Fairies (dancing). Free from anxiety, Free from timidity, etc. Lutin. With keen satisfaction And sense of relief He feels a reaction From trouble and grief. His fears heavy-hearted Have quickly departed. He seeks in enjoyment Congenial employment, Surrenders politely To maidens so sprightly, They're all very sightly, But this is the chief! (Indicating Locrine.) Oh! (Dancing.) Pure informality Marks their civilityâ Lovely locality, Gems of gentilityâ Happy fatality! That it's finality Seems, in reality, Improbability! Fairies (dancing). Pure informality Marks our civility, etc. [The fairies dance off with Lutin. As they go off, Darine enters. Song.âDarine. Triumphant I! Here is the charm! Now to devise a plan to gain my end: If I restore his strong sword arm, He will become my friend. But will it gain the love That I prize all above? That all-enthralling love which I would fain Yield up my very fairyhood to gain! And how shall I attain that dream? Oh, god of impudence, lend me thine art! I have bethought me of a scheme That should enchain his heart! No matter sin or shame So, I fulfil my aimâ The dictates of the heart must be obeyed. So, god of impudence, lend me thine aid! Enter Ethais from bower. He is very weak and ill. Darine (tenderly). How fares Sir Ethais? Ethais. Why grievously! I am no leech and cannot dress my wound. I'm sick and faint from pain and loss of blood! Darine (aside). Now for my plan! (aloud) Sir Ethais, if Phyllon's words be true, Thy wound is but a scratch! Ethais (indignantly). A scratch, forsooth! The devil's claws could scarcely scratch as deep! Darine. He saysâI don't believe himâbut he says That thou hast magnified its character Because thou fearest to renew the fight! He says thou art a coward! Ethais (furiously). By my blood He shall atone for this! Oh, Phyllon, coward! Why, a dozen times We two have fought our battles side by side, And I'm to quail and blanch, forsooth, because We two at last are fighting face to face! Black curses on this wound! Were Lutin here, My sword arm soon would be in gear again! Darine. Lutin is here! Ethais (amazed). Here? Lutin? Darine. Yes, behold! [Shows phial. I have obtained this precious charm from him. Now, knight, to show thy mettle! Ethais (furiously). Give it me! Give me the flask! Darine. One moment, Ethais! This flask is precious, and it hath a price! Ethais. Name thou thy price, and I will give it theeâ Take money, jewels, armour, all I have So that thou leavest me one trusty sword! Darine. Nay, Ethais, I do not want thy wealth; I want thy loveâyes, Ethais, thy love! That priceless love that thou hast lavished on My worthless sister! Ethais. On Selene? Darine. Aye, Thou lovest her, and dost thou think that I Will save thy life for her? Ethais. Selene? Bah! True, she is fair. Well, thou art also fair. What does it matter, her fair face or thine? What matters either face, or hers or thine, When weighed against this outrage on my honour? Darine. Give me that ring, and thou shalt have the charm! Ethais. 'Tis thine. [Gives ring and receives phial. And now, Sir Phyllon, take good heed! [Swallows contents of phial and is at once restored to health and vigour. Enter Sir Phyllon. Phyllon. Why, Ethaisâ Ethais (furiously). So I'm a cur, Sir Liar, and my wound Is but a scratch that I have magnified That I might shun the terrors of thy sword! Phyllon. Hands off, thou drunken madman! Set me free! I never said these things! Ethais. Thou craven cur! Dost thou then fear to reap before my face The crop that thou hast sown behind my back? Phyllon (contemptuously). I am not wont To weigh the words I speak to such as thou! No need to taint thine honour with a lie; Why, Ethais, the truth is black enough! I know thee for a brawling tavern-bully, A hollow friend, a cruel unsparing foe, A reckless perjurer, a reprobate, The curse of women and the scourge of menâ Is not the truth enough, that I should grudge The one brute-virtue of thy satyr-soulâ The instinct courage of a hungry dog? [Ethais is about to fly at Phyllon, but checks himself and turns to Darine. Ethais. Didst thou not tell me he had said these things? Darine. 'Twas but an artifice to gain thy love! [Turns to Phyllon. Forgive me, Phyllon! Phyllon. Bah! release my handâ Thou shameless woman, I have done with thee! [Exit Phyllon. Darine turns to Ethais imploringly. Enter Selene. Selene. Darine! Thou here alone with Ethais? No, noâI will not doubt! Darine. Doubt whom thou wilt, Thou hypocrite! Thou shameless hypocrite! Thou craven victim of thine own designs! Enter all the Fairies. Selene. Darine, what dost thou mean? Darine. Doubt all of us, For we are false to thee, as thou to us. I am as thou hast made me, hypocrite! Selene. Thou art to me as thou hast ever been, Most dearly loved of all these dearly loved! Darine. Away! Thou art the source of all our ill. Zayda. Oh, miserable woman, get thee hence! Thou art no Queen of ours! Darine. Away with her! Down with the traitress Queen! Scena. Darine. Thou art the source of all the ill That blights our Fairyland! Zayda. Thine is the impious hand That worked our misery, until The very air we breathe Was made to reek and seethe With the accursed offence Of plague and pestilence! Darine. Bow thee unto the storm that lowers! Away! thou art no Queen of ours! All. Away, thou art no Queen of ours! Give place to our Darine! Bow thee unto the storm that lowers! Down with the traitress Queen! Zayda. 'Tis true we counselled thee to call These mortals here from earth. 'Twas but to test thy worth! We knew too well that thou wouldst fall, As thou indeed hast done. Thy subjects every one Thine infamy has seen, Thou sorry, sorry Queen! Darine, Zayda, Locrine, and Neodie. Thou hast abused thy royal powers! Away! thou art no Queen of ours! All. Away! thou art no Queen of ours! Give place to our Darine! Bow thee before the storm that lowers! Down with the traitress Queen! Selene. So let it be, for I have proved unfit! I had a trustâI have forsaken it! All. Down with the traitress Queen! Selene. Though my default was born of good intent, Mine was the sin, be mine the punishment! All. Hail to our loved Darine! Selene. Bows in remorse the head that ye contemn. [Taking off her crown and placing it on Darine. Well loved Darine, wear thou this diadem! All. Down with the traitress Queen! Selene. See, my beloved sister-maidens, how Imperially it rests upon her brow! All. Hail to our loved Darine! Thou art our Queen, Beloved Darine! In loyalty We bow to theeâ We bow to thee In loyalty, Beloved Darine, Henceforth our Queen! [The Fairies march round Darine and make obeisance to her. Darine. So may I fall if I forsake my trust! Thy punishment is just. Thou wast a Queen! What art thou now? Selene. I have a kingdom yet! I have a kingdom here in Ethais' heart. A kingdom? Nay, a worldâmy worldâmy world! A world where all is pure and good and braveâ A world of noble thought and noble deedâ A world of brave and gentle chivalryâ A very goodly and right gallant world! This is my kingdom, for I am its Queen! [Turning to Ethais, who comes down. Darine. Thou art no Queen of his, for he is mine; Aye, by the token that thou gavest him, Thou fond and foolish maiden! [Showing ring. Selene (looking at it). No, no, no! It is a counterfeit! No, no, Darine! The punishments of Heaven are merciful! [Takes Ethais' hand to kiss it; she sees that the ring is not there. Oh, Ethais! Is that the ring with which I plighted thee? Ethais (sullenly). Aye, that's the bauble. I have naught to say! Selene (to Darine). It fell from him! Where didst thou find it? Speak! Ethais. I sold it for a charm, that I might have An arm to flog a lying cur withal; A traitor devil, whose false breath had blurred My knightly honourâdearer to my heart Than any love of woman, hers or thine! I had no choice, my honour was at stake! Selene. Thine honour! Thou dost well to speak of that! Can devils take the face and form of gods? Are truth and treachery so near akin That one can wear the other's countenance? Are all such men as thou? Or art thou not Of thine accursed race the most accursed? Why, honourable sir, thou art a knight Who wars with womankind! Thy panoply A goodly form, smooth tongue, and fair, false face; Thy shield a lie, thy weapon an embrace. The emblem of thy skill a broken heart! Thine is a gallant calling, Ethais! Thou manly knightâthis soul of chivalryâ Thou most discreet and prudent warrior! [He approaches her. Away, and touch me not! My nature's gone! May Heaven rain down her fury on thy soul! May every fibre in that perjured heart Quiver with love for one who loves thee not! May thine untrammeled soul at last be caught And fixed and chained and riveted to one Who, with the love of Heaven upon her lips, Carries the hate of Hell within her heart! Ethais. Stay! Hear me out. 'Tis true I trifled with thy love, but then Thy love is not as mortal woman's love. I did not know that it would move thee thus! Selene. Thou didst not know! Art thou so dull that thou canst understand No pain that is not wreaked upon thy frame? Hast thou no knowledge of the form of woe That comes of cheated hopes and trampled hearts? Ethais. Nay, hear me. I have wronged thee bitterly; I will atone for all Selene. Thou shalt atone. Song.âSelene. Hark ye, sir knight. I'll yield my fairy state, That I may follow thee to yonder earth, And join the whispering band of hidden hate Who feed on falsehood and who war with worth; The busy band who stab in secrecy; The blighting band within whose lips is hung The deadliest weapon of earth's armoury! A woman's tongueâa woman's blighting tongue! The talisman I will so deftly wield To twist and turn and torture good to ill, That, were it in thy traitor heart to yield To holy deeds of peace and calm goodwill, Those deeds should seem of holiness bereft, From every form of righteousness averseâ Thy peace a warâthy charity a theftâ Thy calm a fury and thy prayer a curse! [She throws herself on a bank exhausted. Enter Locrine. Locrine. Selene, see! Through the far distant air with rapid flight Our absent brothers wing their way to us! These mortals must return to our own earth! Zayda and Lutin and other Fairies have entered. Lutin (shaking them off). Now, by my head, but this is welcome news! Zayda (horrified). Return to earth? No, Lutin, noânot yet! Life without Lutin, what can that be worth? Lutin. I cannot tell you, for I never tried. Nay, seek not to detain me, I've reformed! And had I not, I don't think I could much enjoy myself In the distracting company of one Who, if she's not in point of fact my wife, [Alluding to Darine. Is so uncomfortably like my wife That she may be my wife for aught I know! Enter Phyllon. Phyllon. Come, Ethais, Lutin, come, to earth again! [Phyllon descends with Lutin. Ethais is about to follow them, but is detained by Selene. Selene. No, no! Thou shalt not goâthou shalt not go! My hopeâmy shattered hope, but still my hope! My loveâmy blighted love, but still my love! My lifeâmy ruined life, but still my life! I'll work and toil for theeâI'll be thy slaveâ Thine humble, silent, and submissive slave! (Furiously.) Nay, but I'll hold thee back! I have the strength Of fifty women! See, thou canst not go! (With passionate triumph.) Nay, but I'll wrest thy love away from thee And fetter it in bondage to my heart! I will be one with thee; I'll cling to thee And thou shalt take me to that world of thine! Ethais. Take thee to earth? I love the world too well To curse it with another termagant! We have enough of them. Release me, foolâ Away from me! I go to that good world Where women are not devils till they die! [Throws off Selene, who falls senseless. He leaps through the cloud and descends. As Ethais disappears the Fairies, who have grouped themselves about the stage in attitudes of despair, appear gradually to wake as from a dream. The moon has disappeared, heavy thunderclouds that have gradually gathered during the preceding scene suddenly disperse, the stage grows light, and the music becomes soft and hymn-like. Selena. Where am I? Zayda! Neodie! Darine! Oh, sisters, I am waking from a dreamâ A fearful dreamâa dream of evil thoughts, Of mortal passion and of mortal hate! I thought that Ethais and Phyllon too Had gone to mid-earthâ Zayda. Nay, it was no dreamâ A sad and sorrowful reality! Yes, we have suffered much, but, Heaven be praised, These mortal men have gone to their own earth And taken with them the bad influence That spread like an infection through our ranks. See, we are as we were! [Embracing her. Selene. Darine! Darine! My well-beloved sister, speak to me! Darine (shamefacedly). I dare not speak to theeâI have no wordsâ I am ashamed! Selene. Oh, sister, let that shame Hang heavily on all, for all have sinned! Oh, let us lay this lesson to our hearts! Let us achieve our work with humbled souls, Free from the folly of self-righteousness. Behold, is there so wide a gulf between The humbled wretch who, being tempted, falls, And that good man who rears an honoured head Because temptation has not come to him? Shall we, from our enforced security Deal mercilessly with poor mortal man, Who struggles, single-handed, to defend The demon-leaguered fortress of his soul? Shall we not rather, seeing how we fell, Give double honour to the champion who Throughout his mortal peril holds his own, E'en though His walls be somewhat battered in the fight? Oh, let us lay this lesson to our hearts! Enter Lutin followed by Ethais and Phyllon as Fairies. Lutin. Your brothers have returned! Selene. My Ethais! Ethais. Seleneâsisters allârejoice with us! We bear the promise of a priceless gift, A source of new and endless happiness! Take every radiant blessing that adorns Our happy land, and all will pale before The lustre of this precious privilege. It isâthat we may love as mortals love! Selene. No, noânot that! No, Ethais, not that! It is a deadly snareâbeware of it! Such love is for mankind and not for us. No, Ethais, we will not have this love! Chorus. Pure as the air, sweet as the morning dew, Reigneth our Queen! Bright in our eyes as Heaven's ethereal blue, Reigneth our Queen! Spirit of love! as thou hast ever been, Be to us evermore, oh, sister-Queen! Unsullied source Of tranquil joy, Pursue thy course Of pure employâ Be thou as thou hast ever been, Our all-beloved sister-Queen! [Darine removes the crown from her head and places it on Selene. The Fairies all kneel in adoration at Selene's feet. Curtain.</field>
