      <field name="fulltext">Introduction before the Act Drop. Music—Love and Fortune rise from opposite traps—both have bandages over their eyes—they feel their way to the centre of the stage, where they encounter each other. Love. Holloa! For. Who's there? Love. You stupid body you, Why can't you look where you are going to? For. I look? Alas, 'twould be of little use,— I am a poor blind woman. Love. Blind! the deuce! Why, I'm a poor blind boy! For. I ought to know That voice. Love. I've heard that step before. For. (feeling) A bow! Nay, then I'm sure— Love. (feeling) What have we here?—a wheel! (seizing Fortune) Fortune is in my grasp! For. 'Tis Love I feel. Love. Feel—ha, ha, ha! The truth why try to smother? (pushes up his bandage) We can see much too clearly through each other. You're no more blind than I am, you sly jade. For. (peeping under her bandage) Hush! Love. Hush! For what! Of whom are you afraid? There are no mortals here to see we see! And if there were, they are more blind than we; And still would trust the painter and the poet, Who flatter them at our expense. For. I know it. And therefore punish them by oft bestowing My prizes on the greatest boobies going. Genius and I are rarely fellow lodgers, Poets I've always shunned. Love. Except Sam Rogers. For. Rogers was rich ere he began to write. He never wanted me, or else he might Love. I only laugh at the conceited elves, And make them very blindly love themselves; But sooth to say, although not their intention, They've served us mightily by their invention, For when we're called capricious or unkind, 'Tis such a fine excuse—“We are so blind!” For. No doubt, but what has brought you here to-day? Love. Oh, Love is in the plot of every play. For. And Fortune must attend it, good or bad— If I can make it good, I shall be glad, For the new lessee's sake. I like new faces. Besides, you know the proverb says, “Audaces Fortuna juvat.” Love. Oh, yes, 'tis as old As true that Fortune's partial to the bold. And he who takes a theatre, I own, Must be amongst the boldest ever known. For. Well, Love resembles Fortune closely there. “None but the brave,” 'tis said, “deserve the fair.” So let us see what we can do betwixt us To aid this scheme in which the Fates have mixed us. What is this play about? Love. I scarcely know. 'Tis a mere sketch in Watteau colours. For. Oh! Love. A frame to shew some scenery and dresses in. For. From what I hear, the author a fine mess is in. He has no wit. Love. If he had I'll engage You wouldn't catch him writing for the stage. For. No poetry. Love. That's a good job, Heaven knows! There's so much poetry that's so like prose. For. And not a tittle of imagination. Love. Who wants it in these days of adaptation? For. It is an adaptation, then? Love. Of course. But then, you know, one man may steal a horse, And t'other not look over a French leaf, Without some critic crying out “Stop thief!” What does it signify? Pooh! let 'em bawl! “Tantararara!” Cupid cries, “Thieves all!” It saves a deal of smoky midnight oil; All my advice is, if you steal, don't spoil. “Chacun reprend son bien ou il le trouve,” Shakespeare himself could prig as I could prove For. Oh, don't name Shakespeare—of his awful shade The new lessee is horribly afraid. Here in such state he lately wore his crown. Mr. Harris succeeded Mr. Charles Kean in the management of the Princess's, whereat the latter had revived several plays of Shakespeare with great magnificence. His spirit on us fatally may frown. Love. What, gentle Shakespeare? pleasant Will, who'd run Through a whole page to make a shocking pun! Who shed a glory round things most grotesque? Who wrote for Grecian clowns the best burlesque? Pyramus and Thisbe, in “Midsummer Night's Dream.” He look on harmless mirth with angry eyes? No, no, he is too genial and too wise. His heart was e'en his matchless mind above— He nothing owes to Fortune, much to Love! For. Granted! so let us do the best we can To pull through this poor little modern man; He seems a bard to whom I may shew kindness! And still preserve my character for blindness. Love. And though he may take something from the French, It is a field on which so many trench. To act no piece that had a smack of Paris in, Poor Mr. Harris would find very harrassing. For. At blind man's buff, though, we again must play, For with the public we've to feel our way. We musn't be too fast. Love. Nor yet too slow. For. You'll follow Fortune? Love. Love does often so. Duo—Love and Fortune. Love. As a child, by your direction, I am quite content to go. For. Woman-like, I've no objection, My power over Love to shew. Love. But the scene of this effusion Is laid in France long time ago. And to keep up the illusion, We must be dressed aprés Watteau. For. Of course? I'd quite forgot! how stupid! But dresses they have here by scores. Love. I've got a dress in which, as Cupid, I danced before Louis Quatorze. Both. Quick, our bandeaux re-adjusting, Let us slip the scenes behind, To please the public—humbly trusting They'll “remember the poor blind!” (Exit Fortune leading Love) (Act drop rises and discovers</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Scene.—The Gardens of Cassandre's Country House, a raised curved path between trees—Group from Watteau—“Noces de Village.” Chorus. Women. Nicolas, the brave and gay, Stole each maiden's heart away, But laugh'd at love until he met And owned the charms of Nicolette. Banish Nymphs, your vain regret, Nicolas weds Nicolette. Men. Nicolette, the young and fair, Drove each shepherd to despair, Till her hand and heart she gave To Nicolas, the gay and brave. Shepherds, all your pangs forget In the joy of Nicolette. All. Vive Nicolas; Vive Nicolette! Distant bells—Enter Bridal Procession of Nicolas and Nicolette—The Shepherds and Shepherdesses present them with bouquets Solo—Nicolette. Thanks, neighbours and friends, For my husband you see, Like a dear little man, Leaves the talking to me. I wish all the single Soon married may be, And the married ones ever As happy as we. Dance—Les Coquettes. Exeunt Nicolas and Nicolette, followed by Bridal Procession, &amp;c. Cassandre advances with Argentine and Diamantine. Cas. Is there no soft infection in this scene, To touch the cold heart of Diamantine? Can she behold the bliss of this fond pair, And still deny as fond a lover's prayer? Dia. Yes, I am happy other's joy to see, But have no wish myself a bride to be. Arg. But I, papa, to wed am quite content, And only wait for you to give consent. Cas. Consent? to marry whom, pray? Arg. Poor Valere! Cas. Poor you may well say. Wed him if you dare! When you can call him rich it will be time To think of it. Dia. Is poverty a crime? Cas. A crime? of course it is. The worst on earth. If folks have nothing, what can they be worth! Air—Cassandre. Cas. Look at me if you would see What a husband ought to be! I have coffers full of gold, Corn in barn, and flocks in fold; All when I shall quit this life, I intend to leave my wife. Let defeated rivals snarling. Talk of one foot in the grave; Better be an old man's darling, Than become a young man's slave. (to Diamantine) All will be yours when I am gone, you know. Dia. Well, then, I'll wed you—just before you go. (exit Diamantine into house) Cas. The cruel tyrant! Mistress, (to Argentine) In before! Let me catch poor Valere but near my door. (Music—Exeunt Cassandre and Argentine into house) Enter Arlequin. Air—Arlequin. “Learning is better than house and land.” A fact that I never could understand. But I freely own I shouldn't be loth To settle the point by trying 'em both. Beginning with “house and land,” and turning, When heartily sick of them, to ‘learning.” Arle. Yes, there's my master, a youth fresh from college, Crammed with all sorts of what some folks call knowledge; And having not a Louis in his purse, Must fall in love to make the matter worse. I'm very sorry for Monsieur Valere. If he can live on love, I can't on air, And for another master I must seek,— I haven't had a decent meal this week. Enter Mezzetin, with a basket on his arm. What do I see? Leandre's valet here? Why, Mezzetin? Mez. Ah, Arlequin, my dear Old friend, who ever thought of meeting you? In service still? Arle. Yes, for my sins. Mez. And who Your master pray? The owner of this garden? The rich Cassandre? Arle. No, I beg your pardon; I'm not his servant—would to Fate I were. Mez. Whose then? Arle. Alas! your master's friend, Valere. Mez. A fine young gentleman, by reputation. Arle. Without the tools required for that vocation. Mez. No money? Arle. Not a sou. But may I ask it, Without offence? What have you in that basket? Mez. Sweetmeats. Arle. The deuce! (eats some) And very good ones, too! Mez. (changing his basket to the other arm) Paws off, friend Arlequin! They're not for you, They are an offering at beauty's shrine— From my young master. Arle. Ah, to whom? Mez. Divine. Arle. Not to our beauty? Surely you don't mean To say Leandre worships Argentine? Mez. No, 'tis Cassandre's ward. Arle. (passing to the other side of Mezzetin) That's some relief! I feared we had a rival. (takes more sweetmeats) Mez. How now, thief? (changes basket to the other arm again) Arle. Excuse me, in a moment of abstraction, I just— Mez. Abstracted. Don't repeat the action! I know your tricks of old, you greedy sinner! Arle. Greedy! So you'd be if you'd had no dinner! Mez. I'll give you one. Arle. You will? Mez. If by your aid This basket can be cleverly conveyed Into the hands of fair Diamantine. Arle. It shall, by me. (offering to take it) Mez. No, no—by me, I mean! There is a letter in it. (confidentially) Arle. (passing round to the side of the basket) Ah, a letter? Mez. Stop on that side. Arle. I can hear so much better On this. Mez. (changing his basket again) Then stay on this. Ah, who comes here? Arle. Pierrot. Mez. Cassandre's man! Arle. Oh, never fear, He's dumb. Mez. But he's not blind. Arle. Yes, when he pleases. The bribes he gets his conscience vastly eases. Upon whatever errand he's now running— To let it be a fool's one he's too cunning. Music—Enter Pierrot, who sees Arlequin, advances to him mysteriously, and slips a letter into his hand, putting his finger on his lip, and making signs that they are observed by Mezzetin. Arle. I understand, Pierrot. But there's no danger; That gentleman to me is not a stranger. And you, I'm sure, he would be proud to know. Hem! Monsieur Mezzetin—Monsieur Pierrot. (they salute each other Of this despatch I dread Valere's perusal— Cassandre gives his suit a plump refusal? (Pierrot nods affirmatively) Duo—Arlequin and Mezzetin. Arle. Alas! bereft of every hope, A halter will, I fear, to-morrow, End with his life, my master's sorrow! Mez. If he can only beg or borrow Enough to buy himself a rope! Arle. And as for me— Mez. Oh, as for you, There's no occasion that to do, My poor dear friend, your country will Be glad to shew its grateful sense Of all your merit and your skill, And hang you at its own expense. Arle. You're too polite. (to Pierrot) Pray let me recommend To your good offices, my worthy friend, Who won't be hanged—that he may rest contented, (aside to Pierrot) At least for having gunpowder invented; He's a fat-headed, foolish, go-between— Leandre and the fair Diamantine. (aloud) And if you can contrive, for my sake, pray do, And let him in (aside) to get the bastinado. (Pierrot signifies he understands, and enjoys the notion—then beckons Mezzetin to follow him, and goes into house) Mez. (to Arlequin) A thousand thanks. Arle. But stop—my dinner? (holding his hand) Mez. True! (pulls out a purse, then putting it up again, as if on second thoughts) Be at the “Turk's Head,” this day week, at two. (runs after Pierrot into house) Arle. The villain! This day week! Well, well, no matter, I trust they'll beat his bones into a batter! I must go tell Valere of his disaster, Then pawn the last shirt I have left my master. (Exit) Enter Love and Fortune. Love. Well, here we are in time, I hope, to do Some good. For. Or mischief. Love. That depends on you! When most to favour mortals I incline— Your wheel too often puts a spoke in mine, Air—Love. Why did the course of true love, pray, Never run smooth? Because, you know, 'Tis your delight in Cupid's way, Ever some stumbling block to throw. But for my pinions, famed for flight, Over it I my neck might break. 'Tis but by taking wing, in spite Of Fortune, sometimes a match I make; Those who upbraid me know me not. Lovers should learn, of chance, the game! Then they would find, when crossed their lot, Fortune, not Love, is most to blame! For. Don't lay your peccadilloes at my doors. Love. Would you have proofs? Here's one now out of scores. Enter Valere with Argentine's note open. Val. Accursed Fortune! Love. (to Fortune) Madam, pray attend! Val. Two loving hearts asunder thus to rend, Blindly the selfish and the cold you cherish, And leave the fond and true to pine and perish. For. Men should have souls—their fortunes far above. Enter Leandre. Lean. O, cruel, barbarous, tyrannic Love! For. (to Love) Hark! 'Tis your turn, Lean. No pity wilt thou take Upon a heart that suffers for thy sake! Diamantine is deaf to all my sighs— Diamantine my tender suit denies! Love. Poor devils! Come, what say you (to Fortune) to our healing The wounds which we are thus accused of dealing? For. As far as I'm concerned, with all my heart. Indeed, it is so written in my part. (they become visible to Valere and Leandre) Love. Mortals, unjustly Love and Fortune blaming— Behold the powers 'gainst whom you've been declaiming! Lean. Cupid— Love. To whom all bosoms are subjected. Val. And Fortune— For. Who arrives when least expected. Duo—Love and Fortune. For. (to Valere) Dismiss your fears! Love. (to Leandre) Dry up your tears! Both. Your foes no longer rate us. For. (to Valere) Accept this purse—in former years Possessed by Fortunatus. As soon as you have emptied it, With gold afresh I stock it. The world's your slave while you've the wit To keep it in your pocket. Love. (to Leandre) The cestus of Venus, Leandre, behold! Its power is equal, or nearly, to gold. You've but to encircle her waist with this zone, And the heart of the cruellest fair is your own! Together. Haste the potent spells to try, But don't blame us, remember, pray, Love. (to Leandre) If my gift you misapply! For. (to Valere) If you fling your chance away! Both. Dismiss your fears—dry up your tears, Your foes no longer rate us; We don't so much delight in spite As some who execrate us. (exeunt Love and Fortune) Lean. Is this a dream? Val. That I can quickly test. (empties the purse into his hat, and it appears full again) Full again! Look, and judge yourself, friend. Lean. Peste! You are in luck! Val. And so I trust are you. Lean. At present I can only trust so, too. Enter Arlequin. Arle. Monsieur. (to Valere) Val. The very man I wanted. Arle. Say The man you must still want. Val. How, sirrah? Pray Explain yourself. Arle. Monsieur, it breaks my heart, But I'm compelled to tell you we must part. Val. Part! Arle. I had hoped to live with you for ages. But— Val. But? But what? Arle. The merest trifle—wages. Val. Aha! and prithee how much do I owe? Arle. Three years, at twenty crowns. Val. Make sixty—so— (takes out his purse) There are a hundred. (empties it into his hat) Arle. Can I trust my sight? Twenty-five Louis d'ors! Val. Count—see they're right, And then—go to the devil! Arle. Without you? No, sir—the devil take me if I do! I leave my master—my dear, liberal, kind, Good master! Val. Scoundrel! I've the greatest mind To break your bones. Arle. Do—do, sir, I entreat! I ask it as a favour at your feet. I can bear anything but separation, From one for whom I have such veneration. Lean. Forgive him! Of the world 'tis but the way Of human nature quite a touching trait! Val. Hence! See of all things I've a fresh supply, And order dinner. Arle. Dinner, sir—I fly! (Exit) Music—Enter Mezzetin, pursued by Crispin, with a stick, and Cassandre. Mez. Help—murder! Cas. Baste him! never mind his bawling! I'll teach them to come here a cat-a-wauling? I'll sugar plum and comfit ye, I will! Lean. Hold—'tis my servant whom you use so ill. What has he done? Cas. Your servant? Then you wrote, I may presume, this pretty little note, To my fair ward, Diamantine? Lean. I did. Cas. Which, in a basket full of sweetmeats hid, That varlet would have slyly to her handed. Lean. Monsieur, he only did as I commanded. If you have anything to say, I'm here To give you satisfaction. Cas. Me—oh, dear! I'm satisfied completely. You've no chance, And on my ward in vain attendance dance. She loves nobody, and shall marry me, Or marry nobody. Lean. That we shall see. (retires) Cas. And you, Monsieur Valere—how often, pray, Must I repeat— Val. Monsieur, I come to say That I am now as rich as I was poor, And, therefore, claim your daughter's hand. Cas. Eh? Sure The moon is at the full! Forgive a doubt, And say how came this happy change about? Val. A freak of Fortune—sudden, unforeseen, Unhoped for. Cas. Hah, indeed! (aside) What does he mean? Have you some fifty Louis won at Faro, Or found out you're the Bashaw of Grand Cairo? Val. (taking out his purse) Do you know gold, pray, when you see it? Cas. No— Not till I feel it. Val. Nay, then, be it so. How many thousand livres must I pay For your consent? Cas. How many thousands? Stay, Let me consider. (aside) This must be some plot. Tell me—how many thousands have you got? Val. More than I can the trouble take to count. So name your price, whatever the amount, I'll pay it down in cash. Cas. (aside) I can but try him. If he's not mad, I should be to deny him. (aloud) Suppose, now, I said twenty thousand? Val. Good. Cas. Or thirty— Val. As you please. Cas. As I please! Would You make it forty, then—or fifty? Val. 'Sdeath I tell you name. Cas. (aside) He takes away my breath! (aloud) My excellent young friend, I can't decide This moment. But my daughter is your bride As soon as I receive the sum agreed on. Val. Kind Fortune, now the happy moments speed on. (Exit—Cassandre directs Crispin to follow Valere, and then exits) Lean. (advancing.) Fortune has smiled upon Valere, 'tis plain— May Love for me, a prize as soon obtain. By all my hopes, here comes Diamantine! But some one's with her. I will here, unseen, Await the opportunity alone— To fling around her this mysterious zone. (Exit) Enter Argentine and Diamantine, from house. Arg. Dearest Diamantine, my joy conceive! My father has relented—I have leave To see Valere, and soon will be his wife. Dia. And have you, then, no dread of married life? Arg. Dread! Wherefore? Dia. Well, I have no trust in men; Our slaves until we wed—our masters then. Arg. Oh, not where Love joins hearts, as you will see, Proved to the world by dear Valere and me. For we shall live as though we'd but one heart, One mind between us—no joy when apart, No sorrow when together. Dia. Well, my dear, I do not doubt you, but I vastly fear That if you really should lead such a life, The world will not believe you man and wife. Arg. You are incorrigible! Dia. May be so. No man shall e'er correct me, that I know; I'd rather laugh at your old dad, Cassandre, Than cry to think—I'd married young Leandre. Arg. You'll change your note, dear, soon. Dia. That may be, too! But I'm afraid, dear, not so soon as you. Arg. Heaven grant me patience! Dia. Ay, indeed, heaven grant it! For when you are a wife I'm sure you'll want it. Arg. I will not stay to hear you love disparage. (going) Dia. I never spoke of love! Arg. Of what then? Dia. Marriage. (Argentine flounces out—Diamantine seats herself under a tree) Enter Fortune. For. I must play Love a little trick—just one. His course would, otherwise, too smoothly run, And spoil the proverb—nay, perhaps, the piece, So Fortune will indulge in a caprice. Lean. (peeping) My charmer is alone at last. Oh, joy! Fortune befriends me! For. Poor deluded boy! (as Leandre steals cautiously round towards the tree Diamantine suddenly rises and exits) Argentine enters, and seats herself in Diamantine's place, just as Leandre arrives behind the tree, and hastily puts the cestus round her waist. Arg. Ah, who is that? What ails me? Let me fly! Lean. Adored Diamantine—fear not, 'tis I. Arg. Diamantine! Alas, sir, you mistake! Lean. How! Not Diamantine? Am I awake? Arg. But as you love her, would to fate I were! Lean. Madam! you sure mistake me for Valere? Arg. Valere! Oh, do not such injustice to Yourself, Leandre. Who can look on you, And not confess, in feature, form, and mind. You far excel Valere—nay, all mankind? Lean. What do I hear? Arg. Alas, forgive me pray, I know not what I do, or what I say. Some mighty power compels me thus to speak, Despite my swelling heart and flaming cheek, Go—go, Leandre—pity, and forget. Oh, would to heaven we had never met. (Exit) Lean. It is the magic zone! Her heart I've won! Oh, fatal error!—what is to be done? Diamantine 'tis useless now pursuing! Accursed Fortune! This is all thy doing! (Exit) For. Well, there I think I've made a little knot, Which to untie will much improve the plot, The cestus lost to make affairs still worse, Valere imprudently must lose his purse. Enter Cassandre and Crispin—They whisper, then advance. Cas. What's this you tell me? Cris. What I've seen and heard. Cas. A magic pursue, that fills itself! Absurd! Fairies have fled the earth this many a day! Cris. Believe or not, the thing is as I say. I saw him empty it five times, at least, To pay for clothes, lace, jewels, and to feast His friends, and that poor, gormandizing knave, His valet, Arlequin. Cas. The case is grave! I must possess that purse by hook or crook. Cris. He comes in all his new-bought splendour—look! With running footmen, and a little fellow— A blackamoor, with a superb umbrella. Enter Valere, richly dressed, in Sedan chair, preceded by running Footmen, a black Boy, &amp;c., and followed by a Notary, with his Clerk and papers. Val. Monsieur Cassandre, have you yet decided? With every proper form I come provided. Cas. (to Notary) Please to be seated. (Notary places himself at a little table—Clerk produces papers, &amp;c.) Now, Monsieur Valere, I have thought seriously on this affair; And as I'm quite convinced that you are one Whom I shall be too proud to call my son— I should not like the world to say I sold My darling child to any man for gold, Therefore, no money shall buy my consent. Give me that purse, and I will be content. Val. This purse? But all my wealth is in it. Cas. All! Bless me, to hold so much, 'tis very small; However, as you will—if you decline, 'Tis not my fault—I'm ready, mind, to sign. Val. But with no sum will you be satisfied? Cas. Nothing except the purse—so take your bride, Or leave her. Val. I leave Argentine? No never! The purse is yours—let me be poor as ever With her I shall feel rich beyond all measure. Sign, I entreat you. Cas. With the greatest pleasure. Give me the purse, together with the pen. Val. There! (giving purse as Notary gives pen) Cas. There! (signs) Val. I am the happiest of men. (signs) Cas. Go, fetch my daughter—she must also sign. Cris. She's here! Enter Argentine. Val. Sweet Argentine! at length thou'rt mine! Arg. Yours?—never! Pardon me, Monsieur Valere, But I have hastened hither to declare Another has my heart, and, while I've life, None but that other e'er shall call me wife. Val. Argentine! sure this is some ill-timed jest? Arg. It is the truth, Valere, I do protest. Cas. What, you refuse? Arg. I do, sir. Cas. Bless my soul! Ha, ha! oh dear! how very, very droll! Val. (advancing on him furiously) Droll! Cas. Mercy on us! Pray don't look so furious I meant to say how very, very curious, After you've parted with your purse that she— Val. Give it me back. Cas. Your purse! oh, pardon me, Upon what grounds should I the purse restore? I've given my consent, what would you more? If Argentine will not give hers, am I To blame forsooth? Val. I scorn to make reply. Cas. You wouldn't have me force my precious child To wed a man she hates? Val. I shall go wild! (aside) Ah! round her waist she wears the magic zone! It is Leandre, then! My rival's known! By Love—by Fortune, thus at once betrayed! Vengeance, I now invoke thee to my aid. (rushes out) For. Thus mortals play the fool, and Fortune slander. Arg. Quick of his danger let me warn Leandre. (Exit) Cas. Ho, ho! Crispin! with laughter I shall burst! How lucky that the purse I'd taken first. I'll prove it's magic power this very minute. (taking it out of his pocket, going to the table to empty it) 'Sdeath and destruction, why, there's nothing it! I'm robbed! thieves! villain! (seizing Crispin) For. (aside) Know, wretch, to thy cost, The gifts of Fortune, when abused, are lost. (Exit) Cas. Oh, dear! Crispin, I'm very ill! I'm dying, And this all comes, you scoundrel, of your lying. Cris. I did not lie—I spoke the truth, although I'm not accustomed to it, as you know. Cas. I do, and yet believed you, for a wonder. So we have each made a confounded blunder! I'll go and make my will—no, no, I won't— I'll marry Diamantine first. Cris. Pray don't! At your age. Cas. Age! I'm not fourscore, and may Live to a hundred. Cris. You've not lived a day. Cas. How! Cris. I can prove it, though perhaps 'twill grieve you. Cas. No, for this time, I swear I won't believe you. Air—Crispin. Three score and ten by common calculation, The years of man amount to; but we'll say He turns four-score, yet in my estimation In all those years he has not lived a day. Out of the eighty, you must first remember The hours of night, you pass asleep in bed; And counting from December to December, Just half your life you'll find you have been dead. To forty years at once by this reduction, We come; and sure the first five from your birth, While cutting teeth and living upon suction You're not alive to what this life is worth! From thirty-five next take, for education, Fifteen, at least at college and at school, When, notwithstanding all your application, The chances are you may turn out a fool. Still twenty you have left us to dispose of, But during them your fortune you've to make, And granting with the luck of some one knows of, 'Tis made in ten—that's ten from life to take. Out of the ten yet left you must allow for The time for shaving, tooth or other aches. Say four, and that leaves six too short I vow, for Regretting past and making fresh mistakes! Meanwhile each hour dispels some fond illusion, Until at length sans eyes, sans teeth, you may Have scarcely sense to come to this conclusion, You've reached fourscore—but haven't lived a day! (Exeunt Cassandre and Crispin) Enter Love and Fortune. Love. So, Madam Fortune! just as I expected— You've upset all the schemes I had projected. On your assistance, too, when I had reckoned. There's no depending on you for a second. For. Who ever said there was? You little pickle, I like your twitting me with being fickle. Air—Fortune. How can I for ever favour, All who make to me their prayer? What enchants one fervent craver, Drives another to despair! To my wheel so famed for turning, Fools come begging to be bound; By no sad experience learning That 'tis certain to go round! Madly, then, against it straining When their only chance, 'tis plain, Lies in patiently remaining Till the wheel goes round again! Love. Well, what's your next turn then, for by this scurvy One, you have turned three lovers topsy-turvy. Two who had solely placed in Love their trust, And one on whom you really fortune thrust. To make amends somehow you must endeavour; They're railing at us both, now, worse than ever. For. Suppose then we change hands. Love help Valere, And Fortune make Leandre now her care. Only remember that my wheel won't stop, And clever folks jump off—when they're atop. Love. Agreed! do you know Colombine? For. Not I! Love. A pretty shepherdess who lives hard by— The wife of Pierrot; although none suspect The fact—She's charming—has but one defect. For. What's that! Love. Why, like her husband, she is dumb. For. That wouldn't a defect be thought by some. Love. Fortune, you are malicious, there's no doubt. But you shall see my charmer. For. Trot her out. Music—Enter Colombine. Pas Seul. For. Not bad. Love. Not bad! For. Well that's the highest praise Bestowed on any talent now-a-days. “The wealthy curlèd darlings of our isle,” Vote it quite vulgar to applaud or smile, And drawl out with an air absurdly sad, Between two puffs of a cigar—“Not bad.” Love. Fortune knows more than Love of youths of fashion. Your fops don't patronise the tender passion. But now to work—take Colombine this dart, And with it tickle old Cassandre's heart, If heart it can be called. Meanwhile, I'll shew That Love has sometimes two strings to his bow. Air—Love. Two strings to his bow Two arrows to fit— Love gained long ago, From Beauty and Wit. The first one swiftly to the heart, Wins a passage through the eyes. Through the ears the other dart, More slowly; but as surely flies! With both at once when aim he takes, Vain defence the victim makes! Ever since, with Wit and Beauty Cupid has been hand and glove, And to serve them deems his duty With the shafts they made for Love. (exeunt Love and Colombine) For. As I would have it. Here's Diamantine! (retires) Enter Diamantine. Dia. Heigho! I've got the fidgets and the spleen, I'm sad without a sorrow—restless range, Not pleased e'en with myself—how very strange! It's something in the weather—I'm so nervous I start at every step. Re-enter Fortune, as a Gipsy. Ugh! Heaven preserve us, Who's that? For. My pretty lady, shall I tell Your fortune? Dia. 'Tis a gipsy woman! well, Tell me; it may divert me. For. Let me look. In that white hand I'll read it like a book. (Diamantine gives her hand) There is a dark young man in love with you. Dia. Pshaw! I know that. For. And there's an old one too. Dia. In league you needn't with the old one be, To find that out which every one can see. What of the future? I can tell the present. For. The future, pretty lady's, not so pleasant. Here is a cross line—bodes no good, and—stay, There's a fair woman standing in your way, Who has designs upon the dark man's heart. Dia. (starting) Indeed! (carelessly) I don't care. For. Why, then, did you start? You are in love with him, though you don't know it. Dia. What folly! For. There are twenty signs that shew it. What's here—a duel— Dia. With Leandre? For. Eh? Is that the name? Dia. Of course—but go on, pray; He won't be hurt. For. Of that I'm not quite sure. I think I see a wound—which you might cure. Dia. Cease trifling. If Leandre fight for me— For. Oh, but he don't—it's the fair woman. Dia. She! Her name? For. What can it signify to you? You don't love him, you say. Dia. Alas, I do. For. (appears as herself) Then trust to Fortune—fear not, but stand there. (placing her on one side) And see me act “La Fortune de la Guerre.” Music—Enter Leandre and Mezzetin, followed by Valere and Arlequin, carrying swords. Lean. Here, on this spot, where Fortune so deceived me. Val. Aye, on this spot, where Love of hope bereaved me. Lean. A better one could not be found to die in. Val. (to Arlequin) Measure the weapons. Mez. (aside) What a fright am I in! Arle. Must I fight too, monsieur? (to Valere) Val. Of course you must. Arle. (aside) I feel that I shall fall without a thrust. Val. You are my second! 'tis the usage here. Arle. Very bad usage. Mezzetin, my dear, (as they measure the swords) You'll let me kill you—I won't hurt you much. Mez. (aside) He mustn't think my courage is but Dutch. (aloud) Kill me? O, yes, I'll let you—if you can, After I've drilled a hole through you, my man. Your stomach always wants something inside, Perhaps with this it will be satisfied. (flourishing his sword) Arle. (aside) Murder! The fare is by no means inviting. And I no stomach ever had for fighting. Lean. While yet 'tis light enough, come on, I say. Arle. Would it were dark enough to run away! (music—Leandre and Valere cross swords—Arlequin and Mezzetin make desperate passes at each other at a respectful distance—at a sign from Fortune the swords of Valere and Leandre break) At the same moment Love appears, leading Argentine, followed by Pierrot—Argentine rushes between Valere and Leandre, who are about to renew the combat with their broken swords, and Pierrot finds himself between Arlequin and Mezzetin, who attack him and drive him into a corner. Lean. Fortune—deceiver! Hence, or give me death! Val. Love, hear me curse thee with my latest breath. Love. Rash fools! who suffer passion to enslave ye! And fling away the goods that Fortune gave ye! A rigid moral were we bent to read, We should desert you in your hour of need, But Love is pitiful, and Fortune kind To those whom they, perhaps, have help'd to blind. Air—Love. The cestus of Venus, by you misapplied, The power of Fortune to loose it defied; It yields to the pressure of true Love alone, Who rivets of Beauty the magical zone. Thus with one touch of kindness your fault I repair, And restore Argentine to her faithful Valere. While Fortune, repenting her practice too keen, Has won for Leandre his Diamantine! Val., Lean. Eternal gratitude to both we vow. Dia. But there's my guardian.— Love. We're your guardians now. Follow our counsel, and the vesper hour Now striking, puts Cassandre in your power. Ensemble. Love, Fortune, Diamantine, Argentine, Valere, Leandre, Arlequin , and Mezzetin. Come! come! come away! One more trick must Fortune play, Love then will crown the happy day. See where his star sheds its propitious ray! Hail, lovers, hail! L'Etoile du Berger! It has become quite dark, and the stars now appear— Pierrot, Arlequin, and Mezzetin re-enter—Argentine and Diamantine whisper to Pierrot, and Leandre and Valere to their Servants—All retire off to the symphony, led by Love and Fortune. Enter Cassandre and Crispin. Cas. Crispin, I'm in a state of fermentation! With a fair nymph I've made an assignation. Cris. What, with that shepherdess I saw dance round you? Cas. Saw? Then you peeped through the keyhole, confound you? Cris. Of course I did. Why, ain't I hired to peep? Your watchdog—whom worse than a dog you keep? Cas. Watch, then, that none approach this bower mysterious, With love, the wench has made me quite delirious. Cris. Love!—and Diamantine? Cas. Diamantine! An Æthiop compared to Beauty's Queen! Crispin, her eye went through me like a needle. Cris. Into some scrape your gooseship she will wheedle, And then go talk— Cas. Talk! she can't speak a word— She's dumb. Cris. Dumb—and a woman? whoe'er heard— Cas. She comes. Here's gold—obey me to the letter. (Exit into bower) Cris. I will. (aside) Provided no one pays me better. Music—Colombine appears in the distance—She glides through the trees, directed by Pierrot, and joins Cassandre—Pierrot advances, unseen by Cassandre, and puts a purse in the hands of Crispin, making signs to him. Cris. Ha, yes. To understand him's not so hard— This is the true way to relieve the guard. (Exit) Pierrot places himself where he can watch Cassandre and Colombine, mocking Cassandre's actions, and occasionally exhibiting a little jealousy at the coquetry of Colombine. Dance—“La Nocturne Amoureuse.” Cassandre, Colombine, and Pierrot. Crispin re-enters, cautiously, communicates with Pierrot, and then advances suddenly, as Cassandre falls on his knees to Colombine. Cris. Run—run, sir, for your life! Cas. Death and confusion! Crispin, what means this insolent intrusion? Concerted Piece—Crispin, Cassandre, Arlequin, &amp;c. Cris. Your life, sir, is in danger. This young and lovely stranger Is the Princess Rocococo, Of the Emperor of Morocco The favourite Sultana, Escaped from his Zenanah! In pursuit of her, come over On board a Sallee rover, He has seized your ward and daughter, And determines all to slaughter! With of Corsairs a fierce crew, sir, He is hunting now for you, sir! Your head, with but a wave of His scimitar, he'll shave off. Cas. Madam, is the rascal lying? (Colombine signs that it is too true) Cris. No—you see there's no denying With terror she is falling. (Colombine shrieks, pretends to faint in Cassandre's arms) Cas. Oh, the deuce! confound her squalling! Cris. Ah, I fear they must have heard her! Yes—they're coming! Cas. Murder! murder! Cris. Run! Cas. I can't, she holds me tight here. Cris. See, they're coming with a light here! Enter Arlequin, disguised fantastically as the Emperor of Morocco—Valere, Leandre, and Mezzetin as Moorish Pirates, dragging in Pierrot, Argentine, and Diamantine as prisoners—Valere's Black Boy with a torch. Cas. (trying to get rid of Colombine) This is all your doing, curse ye! Mercy, mighty monarch! mercy! Arle. Shallaballa! Shallaballo! Cas. What's he saying? Cris. I don't know. But if you wouldn't be his victim, Don't attempt to contradict him. Arle. Hullaballoo! hullaballee! Cris. He demands if you agree? Cas. Oh, to anything he pleases! All my blood the monster freezes! Cris. Your daughter and your ward, sir, He would take with him abroad, sir. Cas. He is welcome to 'em both, I'll take my solemn oath! Cris. And half of all you're worth. Cas. Oh, anything on earth, If my life he'll only spare! Cris. Sign this paper quick, then. (putting one given to him by Arlequin on the ground before Cassandre, and Mezzetin producing pen and ink) Cas. There! (signs) Music—Leandre picks up the paper—Villagers enter suddenly from all sides with lights—Crispin raises Cassandre —Arlequin, Leandre, Valere, and Mezzetin fling off their disguises, and releasing Pierrot, Argentine and Diamantine, all salute Cassandre—Love and Fortune appear at opposite sides. Arle. Monsieur Cassandre, your life I spare. Cas. What do I see? Leandre! Valere! All. Shallaballa! Shallaballo! You have signed and sworn, you know. Ha, ha, ha! ho, ho, ho! Pray excuse our laughing, sir! Princess Rocococo— Ha, ha, ha! ho, ho, ho! Is only Columbine, the wife of poor Pierrot! Chorus. Ha, ha, ha! ho, ho, ho! Pray excuse our laughing, &amp;c. Love and Fortune advance. Love. It's very well to laugh at old Cassandre— But will they laugh with us who are seated yonder? For. Tis time to put an end this folly to; Dear Public, we must now appeal to you; That we're not blind is obvious from our terrors. Would we could make you blind to all our errors. Love. We see them at this moment far too clearly. But for love's sake don't judge us too severely. All for the New Lessee have done their best, And to assist him we have both professed. If you have some affection for the stage— For. If you would have him keep pace with the age— Love. Then in the name of both we you importune, To come for Love— For. And make the fellow's Fortune. Finale. For. Though Shakespeare has left for a while the Princess's, We yet may do something with scenes and with dresses; And so many for them come the drama to see, What the piece is about mayn't of consequence be. Amidst your applause let the green curtain fall, And a piece of good fortune make this for us all! Love. Stop a moment! Remember our scene's laid in France, And 'twas there the old fashion to end with a dance; This piece is produced in the style of the past, And its character must be kept up to the last. Then amid your applause may the green curtain fall, With Good Fortune to us, and my Love to you all! Galop and Chorus. Here let Love with Fortune joining, Long remain these bowers to bless; Two such Deities combining, Surely must command success. Tableau. CURTAIN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chorus. Women. Nicolas, the brave and gay, Stole each maiden's heart away, But laugh'd at love until he met And owned the charms of Nicolette. Banish Nymphs, your vain regret, Nicolas weds Nicolette. Men. Nicolette, the young and fair, Drove each shepherd to despair, Till her hand and heart she gave To Nicolas, the gay and brave. Shepherds, all your pangs forget In the joy of Nicolette. All. Vive Nicolas; Vive Nicolette!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Air—Arlequin. “Learning is better than house and land.” A fact that I never could understand. But I freely own I shouldn't be loth To settle the point by trying 'em both. Beginning with “house and land,” and turning, When heartily sick of them, to ‘learning.” Arle.
