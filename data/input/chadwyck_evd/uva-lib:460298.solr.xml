      <field name="fulltext">Act. I. Scene. I. A rural Scene Enter Cupid Cupid. Above the star-set pavement of the Sky, Near Iove's exalted Throne, I hold my Seat; Yet oft, on errand meet, with downward wing, I lapse from heav'n to earth:ânow goddess-sent, The mandate I obey of that soft Pow'r Felt thro' all Nature from the rolling Spheres Of highest heav'n, thro' Air, &amp; Earth, &amp; Sea.â At her benign approach the Winds subside; Storms sink to restâ&amp; Thunders cease to roll. For whose soft feet her flow'ry incense spreads The teeming Earth, while Neptune's Empire smiles, And Heav'n itself grows brighter by her flame. She, when the vernal Day is first awoke By whisper of Favonius, hears the Choir Of Woods &amp; Groves, &amp; ev'ry secret Bow'r And shady haunt, her high praise chorusing. She smiles, &amp; as she smiles all Nature lives. Her tranquil pow'r can soften ev'ry heart, And smooth the stern brow of the angry Mars; Who oft reclining on her placid breast, His heart subdu'd, lets fall his Spear &amp; Shield, Drinking delicious draughts from love-moist eyes That opiate all his senses with delight.â There chain him Goddess! with thy potent spell: Pour thy soft blandishments thro' all his soul; And give the World repose. Exit. Enter the Fairy Queen. F. Queen. By Dian's sacr'd signal hither brought, I come to seek the quivver'd God of Love; Who brings the CESTUS Cytherea lends To her chaste sister Goddess (fit to try Each Matron's firm faith, &amp; each virgin's truth) To clear a fav'rite Maid from slander foul: Who ne'er in Thought's swift transit, or by breath That ever sever'd yet her vestal lips, Much less by deed substantial, e'er offended Against the chaste Laws Dian hath decreed For all her Vot'ries. Re-enter Cupid. Cupid. Queen! behold Me here! The smiling Goddess Cytherea sends Me, her lov'd Boy, with Iove's assenting nod, With this her CESTUS down to these Abodes, To try its potent charm.âThou Fairy Queen! Hast sought the mighty boon which Venus grants.â And thus my Mother:âTidings long have run Thro' this Caelestial, that on Earth where once A throned Virgin held the sov'reign sway: Where Liberty, &amp; all her Sister Arts Shine like the bright lamps round the throne of Iove; A royal Pair of far-fam'd excellence, In love connubial peerless, &amp; unmatch'd, Blest in their Subjects love as in their own, Dwell highly honor'dâShould that royal Dame (If a meet rival with her could be found.) Deign the great contest; fitly would she find This heav'nly Cincture ring her sacred Waist. Queen. Long hath the trump of Fame these tidings sent Thro' earthly Regions: And each gale hath borne, On rosy-wing to heav'n the tidings fair. And what to-day in Fairy Land is done, In mimic Scene shall one time gain the ear, And please the eye of that same gracious Pair. But to my task.âMe fitly it beseems, (To hide Me from each nice discerning eye, The better to perform my destin'd work) To shroud me in the sacred cloud which once Veil'd thy soft Mother the fair Cyprian Queen In heav'nly umbrage, when in secret flight, She led the Trojan to the stately Walls Which fated Dido builtâimperial Tyre.â So it behoves.âAnd purple-pinion'd God! Put off thy sky-wove robes of heav'nly sheen, And rosy-Coronet: And deck thyself All in habiliments of humble Swain. And for thy fatal Bow, &amp; Quiver, take A past'ral Crook, &amp; Script, &amp; Oaten-Pipe, That for some rural Minstrel thou may'st pass, And gain admittance, by thy carols sweet, To that high Dome where thou must act thy part. Cupid. Queen! I obey.âI'll moult these heav'nly plumes, And vest me in the dress of Cottage-Swain. Exeunt. Scene. II. Enter Florimel Florimel. Where'er I wanderâwheresoe'er I am, The image of my much-lov'd Guyon seems To appear before me.âOfttimes I frequent Yon lonely glade, where we were wont to walk; Where he so often pour'd his tender vows, And pledged me his troth.âWhen silent night Wraps in her sable Mantle half the Globe, In transient dreams I see himâwhen in haste Fondly I strive to rush into his Arms And welcome his return, he flies my presence: And like the Phantoms in the Morning Clouds, The dear delusion melts into thin Air.â Nor is this allâSuspicion looks askaunce On all my smallest deedsâI'm scann'd around: And oft the Duke lets fall ambiguous words, Which, were I prone to doubting, or suspect, Would lead to question e'en Sir Guyon's love; Or, what I scarce dare think, suggest his own. Enter Fiducio. Fiducio. Why still alone?âwhy shun you the gay Throng In which with silent majesty you shine? Why ever pensive, sad, &amp; melancholly?â I bring fresh tidings from your faithful Lord, Scarcely you heed me; or let fall a tear, As if my news were sad.âSay Florimel! What, save thy dear Lord's absence, gives thee pain? Florimel. His absence, good Fiducio! warrants all. The tears I shed, the sighs I heave for him, Are but poor tributes to his high deserts. I mourn to think how little in return My penury of merit will allow Me, his unworthy chosen One, to give.â But other cares oppress Me, good Fiducio! Such as a Maiden jealous of her fame, And spotless honor, ever ought to feel. Fiducio. Alas! what cares? impart them that I may, In absence of my Friend, afford that comfort Which may support you till his wisht Return. Florimel. What I suspect, perhaps may not be true. Nor am I warranted to cast reproach Where any doubt remains: nor call the hand Of tender Pity, or the soothing aid Of thy prompt friendship to relieve a weight Which wayward Fancy only thinks it bears. If ought from ground of my suspicion rise, Of whatsoever growth, however foul, Tho' rankest poison harbour in its care, I will unfold it all to thee Fiducio! Tho' thy assured faith I put to trial, And urge that confidence I ne'er have doubted. Exit Florimel Fiducio alone What can this mean?âSuch purity as her's Suspects not but with ReasonâI'll observe With nicest circumspection all around; And see by this if any Clue I find To lead Me thro' the Labrynth of her doubt. Exit. Scene III. Scene changes. Enter Florimel Florimel. Ye pow'rs! that watch o'er virgin innocence, Guard &amp; protect Me! [To her enter The Fairy Queen.] Queen. That Pow'r is here. Florimel. What may this mean, that ready to my pray'r Such Form divine, for sure divine thou art, Appear to aid me? F. Queen. 'Tis the Fairy Queen: Who at thy birth did welcome thee to life, And gave thee the first blessingâkept aloof Each Fairy-Elf, &amp; those pernicious pow'rs That often sport with Mortals soon as born, And cast the die of their Nativity. I husht the storms to rest at thy first breath: Dispel'd the mirky-mists, &amp; calm'd the Air; And shed upon thy head the dew of heav'n. Unseen thy infant steps have I attended; Watch'd thee in play, &amp; wiped from thine eye The tears which wayward Childhood wont to shed. Thee still I guard with the same tender care. And 'midst the trials which thou must endure, To prove thy steady Virtue, I'll infuse My sov'reign Influenceâtry'd thou must be: Virtue is nought, till resolute Resistance, Prove its full strengthâthen conquest crowns the Conflict. Florimel. All gracious Pow'r! what merit can I claim To be the object of thy high protection? And what am I, that thou, the powerful Queen, Deign thus to guard, protect, &amp; succour Me? F. Queen. The Powers above ordain it.âLearn thy Fate. If thou by trial shalt approve thyself; And thy beloved Lord return from toil, His Enemies subdu'd, he plum'd with conquest; (As in firm faith I trust he will) and give Proof of his prowess &amp; exalted Virtue; Your hands shall link in holiest Union: And from that union mighty Princes rise To bless the People over whom they reign, And in their blessings find their own secur'd: The sov'reign bliss of Kings! Florimel. Immortal Powers! Bless Me in what I am, &amp; what I shall be. Frame Me to your high purpose by your aid: And Make Me worthy of your Ordinance, By Virtues Mortals ought, or can perform. F. Queen. Nor less thy present state demands that pray'r Than doth thy future exaltation need it. For such the Mortal Frame, when plac'd on high, Like the tall Column pointing to the skies, It asks those firm supports &amp; Buttresses, Which Edifices humbler do not need.â Thus then I shed my infl'ence o'er thy heart, And give my benediction on thy head. [waving her Wand] Be true, &amp; firm,â&amp; leave the rest to Heav'n. Exit. Florimel. Farewell! most gracious Queen! &amp; for this visit, Be thank'd thou heav'nly Pow'rs We all adore.â I felt new vigor run thro' all my veins, Warm my cold heart, new stringing ev'ry Nerve As She addresst Me: &amp; I seem to breathe Air of uncommon virtueâfeel delight Chear all my Soul, &amp; animate my frame.â If such Rewards for Virtues I can practice, Let the worst Trials comeâI will endure them: For none too great to gain Sir Guyon's love; And none too arduous for Rewards like those The gracious Pow'r hath promis'd.â End of the first Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. II. Scene I. A Grand Hall in a Palace. Enter Duke, Duchess, Ladies, &amp; Attendants Duke. I have of late observ'd it:âAnd to say true, I do not think that good Sir Guyon's absence Is that alone makes Florimel so sad; Nor that alone for which She shuns our presence. Duchess. Fiducio too seems thoughtful, &amp; reserv'd: Oft knits his brow, &amp; walks with folded arms. Nay! &amp; I've heard him utter deep-fetch'd sighs; As if some pent-up sorrow workt within His breast disturbing.âFrequent in the Grove I've seen him wait till Florimel arriv'd: Then ey'd them walking near as might beseem A Lover's Friend, &amp; a betrothed Fair.â I do not say She's falseâor faithless He; I would not be censorious of the Pair: But thoughts are free. Duke. Why this I oft have seen: And noted much the secret walks they take; And what reserve they put on in our presence. 1st. Lady. Yes!â&amp; I've seen them linked arm in arm, As they say Lovers walkâ&amp; often turn Their face upon each other, &amp; so close, That lip might easily encounter lip, If hearts were so dispos'd. 2d. Lady. And I have seen them smile upon each other; Give nods of Curtesy, &amp; silent winks, Passing each other. 1st. Attendant. And I vow, &amp; swear, I've often seen him tread upon her robe Only to beg her pardon: And She drop Her Kerchief, or some other petty triffle, That he may pick it up &amp; give it to her. Nay! I've seen moreâbut more I will not tell, Lest I be thought suspicious, rude, or forward. Duke. Why Florimel is fairâFiducio handsomeâ Sir Guyon absentâhis return uncertainâ Affection wav'ringâMen insidious Creaturesâ And to say trueâthe best of Us are frail. Duchess. O! this way onward comes the pensive Fair. Please You my Lord! we rally her a little, And see if blushes will not speak the truth? Duke. Retire ye all!âI'll question her alone. Exeunt. Duchess retiring. aside âFiducio shuns Meâturns his eyes from mine, And will not understand their plain heart-language. If he despise my love, he'll find my hate. Enter Florimel. Duke. Well met thou pensive Maid! I wonder much You shun our presenceâ&amp; demean yourself As if you fear'd, or had receiv'd, some Inj'ry. What makes you sad? Sir Guyon will return: His race of Glory run, he'll soon be here, To reap the precious harvest of his Toil. Florimel. Still must Sir Guyon toil, encounter Dangers: And think you, good my Lord! That I can couch On bed of down, &amp; close my eyes in peace, Like Children void of care? while he perhaps, Reclines his weary head on the cold ground; Or traverses the Desart's trackless wilds? Ill would it then beseem Me to rejoice, Such cause being ever present for my grief. Duke. This well becomes you Florimel!âYet tears Drown the soft Loves, which playful in these eyes, Were wont to ravish all who caught their glances. Florimel. Alas! my Lord! what beauty I can boast I never wish should captivate, or please But One, the only he, my plighted Lord. Duke. And yet our eyes may feast upon the Gems Which Others ownâElse why such lavishment In splendid Equipage, &amp; rich attire? These are not for our own, but others view: And in their likings We find half our joy. Florimel. Why true, my Lord!âBut pleasures of the Soul Lay not their treasures open to the view Of each admiring eyeâIts precious Casket The heart unlocks not, as of vulgar stores, The sacred Contents; But keeps them close: Closer than Misers their ill-worship'd Pelf. Duke. And dost thou think the charms which thee adorn That captivate the eye, &amp; move the sense, Even to extasy, of each Beholder, Were giv'n to be conceal'd? Can heav'n enkindle Such bright lights of its own, &amp; then forbid Our gazing on their lusture?âthat were vain, And solemn mock'ry of our best made senses. Florimel. What means your speech My Lord! I cannot think You aim the shaft at Me, &amp; Me alone: If it be so, 'twere best that I retire, Lest you give cause, or I should give offence. Duke. Then to be freeâI think that other eyes Can read your letter'd beauties with a sense As keen as can Sir Guyon'sâ&amp; perhaps Of ampler power to do those beauties justice. Florimel. What ampler pow'r can any one possess Than does Sir Guyon?âHe's of noblest nature. His soul, exalted to the highest pitch Of human greatness, suffers no compeer.â Then who has ampler pow'r to do Me justice? Or who the pow'r like him to make Me blest? Duke. I do not call in question Florimel! Sir Guyon's merit, or his high deserts: But others sure may wish as much as he, To gain your good grace, &amp; secure your favour. Even I would stoopâ&amp; doâto ask the boon. And as first act of fealty, I swear Upon this charming handâ[taking her hand] Florimel. What mean you Sir! [withdrawing her hand hastily] Is it alone to try my steady faith Towards Sir Guyon, that you thus presume? Or else, forgetting other sacred ties, You loose the reins of your unbridl'd thought, And make this bold attempt upon my honor? Duke. I understand you wellâ'tis true I've tak'n The Duchess to my state for policy, And for our great allianceâAnd in this The World upholds Me: Ev'ry Day's example Sanctions such unions; while the heart is free, And left at large to follow its affection. Florimel. Alas! my Lord! no moreâYou quite forget Your state &amp; placeâforget too who I am: One in my loveâbetroth'dâ&amp; one afflicted. Then do not crush a broken reed to pieces; And wound a heart already much distresst. Duke. Why! if another's truant disposition May plead for our escapes, I freely say, I've often seen My Duchess cast an eye Of tender languishment on your Fiducio. Florimel. On my Fiducio?âYesâhe is my Friend: And such he is with warranty of heaven. Duke. Come comeâthis will not doâI have beheld Some tender intercourse between You Two, Which savours something short of heav'nly love. Florimel. Then have your eyes read falsely, or your heart, ('Tis with respect, as yet, My Lord! I speak) Put a false comment on his deeds &amp; mine.â My Lord, forbear!âdishonor not yourself In vain attempt on MeâDesist, I pray You. And, lest, in vindication of my honor, I should forget my duty, &amp; your state, I humbly take my leave:âBeseech your Grace To recollect your duty, &amp; yourself. Exit. Duke. Her virtue while it awes me doth astonish: Methought I saw new charms when She reprov'd. Such love as mine is not so soon repuls'd: I'll seek a fitter time, &amp; fitter place. Exit. Scene II Scene changes. Enter Fiducio &amp; Florimel meeting: She appears disorder'd. Fiducio. What mean these downcast looks? &amp; outward signs Of newly waken'd sorrow?âspeak I pray You! Florimel. The Dukeâ Fiducio. Why, what of him, he's sure thy friend? Florimel. Yes, such a Friend, Fiducio! as would rob Me of thy friendship, &amp; mine own dear honor. Fiducio. It cannot be. Florimel. It isâhe hath assail'd it. Fiducio. Speak again. Florimel. In verity, he hath assail'd mine honor. Fiducio. Say, in what form? Florimel. By off'ring Me his love. Fiducio. In manner doubtless? Florimel. Yesâno doubt remains. Fiducio. Then Confidence, &amp; Honor, flee to shades; And shun for ever the high courts of Princes. House ye with cottage Swains who know not guile; And dwell content with their simplicity. Florimel. To move thee moreâhe challenged our friendship: And call'd thee mine, e'en in the very sense He wisht me to be hisâAnd couch'd in terms Of no ambiguous note, suspicion hinted His Duchess look'd on thee with tender eye. And pleaded for his truant Disposition, The policy of Princes, &amp; Alliance. Fiducio. Didst Thou not spurn him from Thee? Florimel. In such sort As fitted my firm Virtue, &amp; his State; As yet both undebas'dâ&amp; him besought, To recollect his station, &amp; himself. Fiducio. Thus ever doth revolting Duty shroud Itself in vain pretext: &amp; others faults Urge in defence of its Delinquencies: And under colour of another's fault, It varnishes its own.âO! had I been Within the breath of his audacious offer, By heav'ns! the sacred Reverence I bear To his high name &amp; Office, had not stop'd This hand to do thee right, &amp; Myself justice. Florimel. This ardor well becomes theeâBut, my friend! Safe in my virtue, be assur'd my sense Of wrongs like these, tho' felt with indignation, Will not allow me to demean Myself Below what now I amâ&amp; what I shall be. Fiducio. What thou now art, I knowâwhat thou shalt be, Lives only in the undisclosed womb Of teeming Time: And heav'n alone can tell What thou shalt beâ&amp; cast thy future lot. Florimel. But may not heav'n in special grace, disclose Its future dealings? Fiducio. I say not but it may. Yet special grace like this must bear its seal, And come in such unquestionable form, That hesitating Doubt shall close the lip. Florimel. Then hear a tale will balm the wound, tho' deep, These new recited tidings have inflicted.â Iust after last we parted, as I walk'd In pensive sorrowâsudden there appear'd A form divine before Meâ&amp; with looks Of gracious condescension, 'gan discourse: Saluted Me as Mother doth her child. Said she presided at my very birth; Kept ev'ry pow'r pernicious far away By her kind influenceâwatcht me when a Babe; And was my guardian Deity. Fiducio. 'Tis strange. Florimel. Nor stranger than 'tis trueâShe further said; If thou by trial shalt approve thyself, And thy beloved Lord return from Toil, (As in firm faith I trust he will) &amp; give Proof of his prowess &amp; exalted Virtue; Your hands shall link in holiest union: And from that union mighty Princes rise To bless the People over whom they reign: And in their People's blessing find their own; The sov'reign bliss of Kings. Fiducio. The Omen I receiveâ&amp; bless the Power That hath reveal'd this comfort to thy Soul. Forward I lookâ&amp; with auspicious joy, Anticipate thy happinessâ&amp; feel, E'en at this present moment, future bliss.â But say!ârevealed not the Pow'r her name? Florimel. She didâ&amp; said She was the Fairy Queen. Fiducio. Then be the Pow'r ador'dâNow Florimel! I see the clouds that shadow'd Us around Retiring allâThe light of Joy breaks in: And, like the glorious Sun, the Storm past o'er, Gives a new lustre, gilding distant Scenes With a fresh glory, &amp; a brighter beam.â Come, heav'n-born Hope! come with thy cherub-smile, With dove-like fondness sit upon our hearts; Till, by thy fost'ring care, our new-hatcht joys Take wing, &amp; wanton in the air of heav'n. Exeunt. Scene III. A romantic Scene in a Forrest. Enter Sir Guyon in armour. Sir Guyon. Tho' toil succeed to toil, &amp; one Encounter Heralds anotherâtho' I long have borne Fatigue &amp; hunger, till to lowest ebb The tide of Life was fall'nâknown no suspense Of labour since my mission; yet the thought Of my Reward in Florimel bears up My otherwise defective pow'rs, &amp; balms Each heart-felt sorrow. O! all-gracious heav'n! Still still support me in the hour of trial; And raise my virtue to the highest bent Of manly daring; that I may deserve, And gain at last this your most precious prize. Enter the Fairy Queen. F. Queen. When Virtue sends its Oraisons on high From unpolluted lips, the pray'r is heard.â Once more I come to comfort &amp; assist thee; To aid thee in thy purpose, &amp; infuse Fresh vigor may support thee to perform All the high biddings which I have commanded. Go on &amp; conquerâlittle now remains, Compar'd with thy past conflicts, to achieve. The gracious pow'r that watches o'er thy head Alike attends thy FlorimelâHer virtue, As is thy prowess, must be put to trial. Both try'd, like melted Gold from dross refin'd, Shall shine in peerless lustre full of glory. Sir Guyon. If my Request be not presumptuous, say How long these ordeal suff'rings must I bear? And when an end (for Mortals ever wish A period to their suff'rings) of my toils? F. Queen. Be patient in thy toils, &amp; that will serve More than the knowledge, when these toils will end To lead thee on to glory.âLeave the rest To those high Powers who ever will the best. Meanwhile bethink thee, that thy promis'd bliss Ensures a certain end to all thy toils: What boots it then to know the day, or hour, When this bliss shall arrive?âstill for thy comfort, I will unfold (for this I am permitted) The sign by which thou shall be well assur'd, Thy present sufferings are about to cease.â The Omen seen, straight sheath thy conqu'ring sword. Thrice having wash'd thee in the running stream, With pure ablution, then thou mayst return: And all that heav'n hath spoke shall be fulfill'd.â The Omen this:âA Falcon from the West Shall chase a snow-white Dove thro' mid-way air, And seize the preyâthen hover o'er thy head, And drop the trembling Quarry at thy feet. Sir Guyon. Thanks, gentle Pow'r! for these kind admonitions: And for the promis'd Omen, thank'd be heav'n. Contented I submitâ&amp; meet each danger, Secure in heav'n's assistance, &amp; support.â Most gracious Queen farewell [to the F. Queen Retiring] F. Queen. âFarewell! &amp; prosper Exeunt. End of Act II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. Scene I Scene, a Magnificent Hall: A Banquet; at which sit The Duke, Duchess and Ladies &amp;c, with Attendants. Duke. Why Florimel appear not at our Banquet Seems somewhat strange: And the excuse she sends Is so ambiguous, that 'twere hard to guess Her real meaning. Duchess. And Fiducio too Withholds his presence under the pretence Of sudden illness: Yet I saw him walk Under the Palm Trees of the Garden grove, In shade too cool for sickness. Duke. Doubtless both Have taken some offence; or mean to treat Our self, or State, with markt indignity.â But she is waywardâAnd Fiducio oft Hath melancholly humours which sit dull And heavy on his senses; cloud his brain, And so perplex him with vain Phantasies. Enter a Servant. Servant. A Youth with face of Hebe, &amp; with voice Soothing &amp; gentle as the tend'rest Maid, Of sweet demeanour, &amp; of aspect mild, Yet humbly vested as a Shepherd Swain, With past'ral Crook, &amp; Scrip, &amp; Oaten-Pipe, Waits at the Portal, &amp; an entrance asks; Begging You hear his unskill'd Minstrelsy. Duke. Admit the YouthâWe'll hear this scarce-fledg'd Bird: Perhaps his song may charm Us, or amuse. His wild notes may excel the measur'd time, In which nice Art attempts in vain to bind The yet untaken soul of Harmony. Enter Cupid, in a Shepherd's dress. Duke. Whence art thou Boy? &amp; what thy name &amp; trade? Cupid. Far in a Vale that winds below the hills, On which 'tis said the Fairies oft descend, And play their mid-night gambols on the green, I tend my Father's FlockâAmyntor he, Fidelio I am nam'd: a Shepherd Swain, Who led by roving fancy hither came, To see, what ne'er these eyes beheld before; This goodly Palace, &amp; this noble Train, Of which I oft have heardâMy Father askt, Gave me full liberty to rove a while, To play the Minstrel's part, &amp; then return. Duke. Thou tellst an artless taleâ&amp; in thy looks Sit sweet Content, &amp; harmless Innocence. Come then &amp; breathe thy Pipe, or raise thy voice Either belikes thee best: And let us taste Of that delicious Draught that lulls the soul, Or raises it to Extasy.âBegin! Cupid playsâthen sings: Song When Morn's first gentle beams appear, And drive the Clouds from hills away; The dewy-Landscape seems more fair, Than each, tho' fair, foregoing Day. This lovely Scene, The Fairy Queen, Reveals to Me, As Emblem of Fair Chastity. When Winter clothes the hills with snow, With Iceicles on ev'ry shed, And sheets the humble Vales below With heav'nly Carpet lightly spread: This wint'ry sheen, The Fairy Queen, Presents to Me, As Emblem of cold Chastity. When gentle Riv'lets glide along, And polisht pebbles shine below; And Songsters pour their grateful Song, When Hawthorn buds begin to blow: These Waters clear, The Fairy Fair, Presents to Me, Emblems of purer Chastity. Duke. Urchin! thy song exceeds thy age, &amp; state: And much I wonder at the Ditty's frame. Of whom didst learn it? Cupid. âOf the Fairy Queen. Duke. The Fairy Queen? Thy riddle Boy expound. Cupid. That will I gladlyâ'Tis for this I come: 'Tis to explain my Sonnet that I sang it. Duke. Be briefâfor Expectation lends its ear. Cupid. Oft as I wander in the peaceful Vale, Or climb the Mountain's top, or lay Me down On the soft herbage at decline of Day; I hear aÃ«rial notes of dulcet sound That fill my soul with bliss, &amp; fix each sense In sweet forgetfulness, all but the Ear, And that is charm'd to extasy.âI sleep, And then such pleasing Phansies fill my brain, That when I wake I strive to sleep again; Wishing that such sleep would for aye endure. Duke. Why! thou art fairy-born, or fairy-led: Or hath thy Nurse these vain tales told to thee, And school'd thee in these rural Mysteries? Cupid. Ye little ween the high-born line I boast; Or who my Mother is, or who Myself: But Time shall give it utt'ranceâhear Me on. These are no housewife's tales, or Nurses dreams: The Fairy Queen herself hath school'd me in them. She, gentle Pow'r presided at my birth; Fed Me with honey from the wild-Bee's store; Washt Me in dew ambrosialâgave Me milk Sweet as the fabled Nectar of the Gods: And often pillow'd Me upon her breast, Where I have lain, &amp; slept, &amp; dreamt of heav'n. Sometimes on beds of Rose, &amp; Hyacinth, Sweet Marjoram &amp; wild Thyme would She couch Her dainty limbs, &amp; on the mossy sod; And leave behind her smells of sweet perfume; Sweeter than Rose, or Vi'let, Thyme, or Balm: So that I ever knew where She had lain: And in the soft impression she had made Upon the flow'ry Couch, I us'd to stretch Myself in extasyâ&amp; felt such bliss, Which, now relating, seem I to renew. Duke. Why this is coinage of wild Phantasy. Were but thy stature higherâdid thy chin Put forth the bud of Manhood, I should say, These are the transports of the madning brain Of first-love stricken Youth. Cupid. Then further hear; And see a sacred Token, which the Queen (To prove the verity of what I speak) Hath given to my careâBehold this Band! [shewing the Cestus] This sacred Girdle fraught with pow'rful charms: Wove by the Graces in the Loom of Heav'n: Inlaid with stars from out the Milky-Way. The stud is Saphire, which chaste Dian gave To ring the Bracelet from the precious Vest That claspt the Virgin Purity herself. Duke. More Riddles stillâIf Dian were not nam'd, I should suspect thee for that wanton Boy Whom Venus calls her Son, tho' thus disguis'd. Cupid. A less suspicion might be less of truth. Hear my whole Taleâthen judge Me as You please. âThis Girdle was (as Faries wont Report, And as Dan Spenser sung in his high strain) âDame Venus Girdle, by her 'steemed dear; âWhat time in wively sort She us'd to live: âBut in her hours of dalliance laid aside, âAs all too sacred for her looser sport. âThe same which Venus when she was dispos'd, âOn th'Aridalian Mount, that seat of Bliss, âTo visit her beloved Paramour âThe God of War, she from her sweet waist cast, âThe Loves &amp; Graces smiling by her side.â âThis Girdle proves the Virtue of chaste Love, âAnd wivehood true of all who can it wear: âBut whoso'e'er in thought, or deed prove false, âCannot this Cincture round her waist endure; âBut it will sudden loose, &amp; straight untye: âNor circle ought but waist of Chastity. Duchess. Wonderful Girdle! truly. Cupid. Madam 'tis: Please You first try its charm your Grace's self? Duchess. I do not deal in Amulets or charms; They're of uncertain use, &amp; doubtful virtue: They prove but little save credulity. Cupid. Madam! this Cincture is not of such sort: It doth contain the potency I warrant. First Lady. Then let me try its virtueâfor my own I trust will bear the strictest scrutiny. Cupid. Ere with this sacred Band your tender Waist You venture to encircle, think what you risque. 1st Lady. I'll try the BandâI never have offended. [binds it on] Enter the Fairy Queen unseen. 1st. Lady. There Boy! behold how well it fits my body! [The Fairy Queen unobserv'd, touches it: it flies off] 1st. Lady. Why! it was onâ&amp; daintily did fit. Cupid. Aye, Madam! but it burst, &amp; would not stay. 1st. Lady. The Locket's faultyâIt did loose itself. Cupid. The Locket's not imperfectâwere you not, The Cincture once lockt round your faultless waist, Close as the Ivy to the parent Oak, Or twisted Tendril round the spreading Vine Implicitly would twineânor ever loose, Till urg'd by hand divine, or hand commission'd. 2d. Lady. Give me the charmâI'll try if it befit My unoffending waistâI warrant You I'll try the Girdle's pow'r, &amp; Locket's firmness. Cupid. Lady! the charge before, I now renew: Think of the Girdle's Virtue, &amp; your own. 2d. Lady. I have,â&amp; having thought, thus bind it on. [binding it on] Thereâit sits close as Ivy round the Oak, And clasps Me like the tendril of the Vine. [The Fairy Queen touches itâit flies off.] 2d. Lady. Bless Me! I breath'd so hard I burst the Belt. Cupid. No! Lady!âBreath like yours can never burst it. The Girdle is not faulty. 2d Lady. Take the Bauble: 'Tis a meer trick to put Us all to shame. 1st. Attendant. Please your Grace! let Me try this precious thing? I'm sure I ne'er in thought, or word, or deed, Offended 'gainst the law of Chastity. Duchess. Give her the Girdleâlet her make the trial. [Cupid gives her the Cestus] [the moment the F. Queen touches it, it flies off] 1st. Attendant. O! heavens! I swear I felt a Giant's hand Squeeze almost close my ribs, &amp; break the band: I vow I did not do it. [Cupid offers it to the 2d. Attendant] Cupid. Please you try? 2d. Attendant. O! no: I fear a Giant. [Offers it to a third] 3d. Attendant. âSo do I.â But yet I'll make essayâhow my hand shakes? [trying &amp; cannot lock it] Ah! these are fears of maiden Modesty: I'm always taken so when Men assail Me.â I see how 'tisâThe Charm has wond'rous pow'r.â I've try'd enough: &amp; giv'n sufficient proof That only maiden fears prevent the clasping. [returning the Cestus] 1st. Lady. How should it fit a Mortal? he did say, The Graces wove it in the Loom of heav'n. 'Tis only fit then for celestial Beings; And let Celestials wear itâI despise it. 2d. Lady. Aye! as the Graces were employ'd to make it, 'Tis therefore fitting only Venus' self, Or some such wanton Pow'râWe are abus'd. 1st. Attendt. Yes!â&amp; he said the Stars were milk, &amp; whey: I wonder We believ'd him, &amp; made trial. 2d. Attendt. The Urchin further said, that Dian gave Her Saphire for the Locketâwould a Goddess, More than a Mortal, part with such fine things To such a Boy as this? &amp; run the chance To lose the Locket, &amp; the Bracelet too? I'll not beleive itâNoâI'll not beleive it. Cupid. Beleive Ye All, &amp; think whate'er You please: The Girdle holds the sacred pow'r I boast.â Lady! perhaps a waist may yet be found, To prove the verity of what I vouch. Is there no other Fair One who may try Its potency &amp; Merit? Duke. âWell remember'dâ Call Florimelâ&amp; let her try the charm: If it prove false on her, why, I shall think He mocks Us with this Cestus; &amp; is sent By some swart Fairy to impose on Us: Or that a Fairy's self this quaint game plays, As oft they do on Fairy-Holy-Days. Duchess. Here comes the Lady. Cupid. âHail! thou gentle Fair! His Grace has sent for You to try this band. Potent its charm &amp; pow'râIt surely proves (If it abide unloossen'd round the Waist, After it once embrace that charming round) The Chastity of her whose waist it binds: And proves, in thought, word, deed, She ne'er offended. 'Tis Venus' Girdle, wrought by hands devine; And lent by Dianâwho, for precious purpose, Sent by the Fairy Queen, directs it hither.â Perhaps You will essay the Girdle's power? Florimel. Faultless in deed, &amp; word, &amp; very thought! The Trial is above our mortal state. Cupid. Lady! I pray be not discomfitted: More hazardous the trial, more the glory, If, after trial, conquest crown the deed. Florimel. Tho' I have never swerv'd in love or duty Towards my plighted Lordânor ever thought Of any He but him to wed &amp; love; Yet, like the Light'ning's glare (but that I know not) Some sudden glance might (I unconscious now) Have shot across my wayward Phantasy. And tho' with nicest care, like new-made Garment, I've kept unsun'd my Robe of Chastity; Some Moth might thither unperceived steal, And soil this gracious Mantle.âGood, my Lord! Let it not then be thought the voice of fear, Or trembling Conscience that I shun the test: But that I would not wantonly appear, To urge the trial, in full confidence, That I, unlike all Mortals, ne'er offended. Duke. If thy pure Spirit never hath offended, Why leave thy fair fame open to the shaft Of aiming Envy? or licentious tongue Of foul Suspicion? when, by present trial, Thou hast nought to hazard, &amp; so much to gain. Cupid. Faint not fair Lady! in thy good resolves; But try the Girdle: For as oft 'tis seen That frontless Guilt assume the port of Virtue; So the chaste fear that keeps Us from offence, Will sometimes lead Us to suspect Ourselves, The heart yet pure, &amp; thoughts immaculate. Beseech You make the trial. Florimel. âGive the Band!â [Takes itâafter a pause] Chaste Goddess of the Woods! &amp; silent Night! Stop my rash hand with unperceived stay; Or stop the vital current in my veins, Rather than suffer Me to make the trial Which my firm faith, &amp; truth cannot abide.â [after a long pause] No secret hand witholding,âI obey: And thus I gird Me with this sacred Band. [pulling on the Cestus] [The Fairy Queen, &amp; Cupid try it on each side.] Cupid. âFirm as the Zone of Heaven it rounds her waist; And seems to make a part of her Attire, As doth the Circle round the Ring-Dove's neck.â Then wear it Lady! till some favour'd hand, Blest in thy love, shall solve the sacred Band. Florimel. Me it beseems not, in this splendid Crown, To boast of this well-fitting Annulet; Seeing it proves but what I ought to be: And what ten-thousand more with me may boast; Unshaken faith, pure love, &amp; Chastity. F. Queen. Now it behoves Me to reveal Myself. [aside] Cupid. Lady! thy speech befits thee like the Zone For Modesty is ever the bright stone That gems the ring of Merit &amp; of Virtue. [Enter The Fairy Queen in a richly ornamented Robe] All appear astonish'd. Cupid Wonder not at th'Appearance of this Form! The Fairy Queen herself now stands before You. F. Queen. Behold Me here! sent by the Powers divine That watch o'er maiden purity, to prove This Lady's firm faith, &amp; unspotted Virtue. Unseen have I that sacred Cestus guarded: My sightless hand, with unfelt touch, essay'd How well it fitted each encircled Fair. How aptly Ye all know who it have try'd. I cast my veil o'er ev'ry blushing cheek: If pure from deed of shame, be thought forgiv'n. For You! unsully'd Excellence! this hour Comes fraught with blessings of no vulgar need. The laughing Loves &amp; Graces now descend And hov'ring o'er you shed unseen delights: And, to crown all, Behold Sir Guyon comes! Whose hand alone that Bracelet shall unloose. [Enter Sir Guyon, attended by Fiducio.] Sir Guyon. First, noble Duke! in duty bound, I bow Before Your Graceâ&amp; Madam next to You, [To the Duchess] And to this goodly Circle.âNow my heart May be allow'd to pour its transports forth On the dear hand of this approved Fair. [taking, &amp; kissing Florimel's hand] F. Queen. Forbear these Raptures! till thou stand approv'd As the fit Partner for this honor'd Maid. Sir Guyon. Soft Power! I will obeyâ&amp; yield Myself To the keen question of approving Trial. F. Queen. As this fair Lady of her plighted faith And love t'wards thee, hath giv'n substantial proof; And by that proof hath merited thy grace: So, as at first ordain'd, behoves the same Of Thee to give:â&amp; in a fair return For gem-like purity, &amp; maiden honor; That Thou give equal proof of manly glory.â Is the huge Giant Sloth by Thee subdu'd? Hast Thou o'ercome the Syren Pleasure's charms? And cursed Mammon's Empire trodden down; Nor glean'd one trophy from his golden store? Sir Guyon. Imperial Dame! I haveâThy potent aid Lent to my arm its nerve, &amp; crown'd the conquest. F. Queen. In brief recite thy conflicts in our presence; That on the brow of Merit we may bind The palmy Crown of Victory.âFirst of Sloth.â Sir Guyon. After long toil &amp; pain, I sought Repose: Left the wild Forrest where I oft had lain Upon my Mother Earth, beset with Dangers. At length a moss-grown Roof, beneath a Rock, Appear'd midst tangl'd boughs of unprun'd Trees. This house, if house it might be call'd, I enter'd. The Portal was o'ergrown with thorns pernicious That almost bar'd my entranceâenter'd in I found a spacious HallâScatter'd around, In careless heaps of ruin, fragments lay Of yet unfinisht workâRich Tap'stry hung With antique shapes inwrought around the Chamber, O'er which Arachne spread her subtle Net. Upon a Couch of down I saw reclin'd An uncooth Wight, huge, cumbersome, &amp; bloated. An half-drain'd Bowl of Wine stood by the Couch, Within his reach; which, ever, &amp; anon, Waking he tasted, &amp; again sunk down To indolent Repose. Him with my Spear, By unoffensive touch, I strove to wake: When instantly the Caitif rous'd from slumber, And leapt upon Meâin his potent grasp Encircling Me aroundâWhen straight I felt A sudden torpor run thro' all my veins Enfeebling ev'ry pow'râAnd much I wisht To quaff his Bowl, &amp; press his Bed of down. When, strange to sense! thro' all my curdling blood A pow'r diffus'dâMy spirits I regain'd; And struggling, threw the Carle upon the ground: Where 'stound he layâI left him in the swoon. F. Queen. The pow'r then felt was Mineâ'tis heav'n alone Gives strength for such encountersâBut proceed. Sir Guyon. I onward sped my wayâ&amp; passing through Another such Pavilion, left the place Escaping at the Postern. With new strength, Gain'd by this new encounter, on I presst And at the close of Day, thro' winding paths On each side deckt with flow'rs, I urg'd my steps. Birds sang on every branchâthe Winds were husht, Save the soft whisper of the Evening breeze: While perfum'd sweets 'gan every where to breathe This Paradise around.âWhen lo! appear'd A stately Edifice of wondrous Art: âIt framed was of precious Ivory; âAnd on the Jasper Columns was ingrav'd, âIn rarest workmanship, the history âOf Iason &amp; MedeaâArgos stood, At proper distance, prominent in gold: And the fam'd Euxine seem'd to lift its waves âOf shining Crystal.âIn the Porch did sit, âWith divers flow'rs daintily bedeckt, âA comely Personage, of stature tall: âIn his right hand a Mazer Bowl he held; âAnd courted Strangers to its fatal taste. âHis Chalice I rejected, pressing on I past the Portal. F. Queen. Enter'd, what appear'd? Sir Guyon. I heard unusal soundsâsmelt rich perfumes: Each sense was ravisht with delightâI felt Throughout my frame a thrilling pleasure run, My heart dilate, &amp; gentle tremors shake My captivated Nerves.âBut when I saw The Goddess of the Place, my eyes were fixt In wonder &amp; astonishmentâI gaz'd With ardent rapture on the heav'n form'd Pow'r, For heav'nly it seem'd to eyes of sense. âUpon a Bed of Roses she was laid, âAs faint thro' heat, or dight to pleasant sin. âShe was array'd, or rather disarray'd, âIn veil of silk, &amp; silver, all so thin âThat hid no whit her skin of Alabaster. âHer snowy-waist was bare, almost to shame: âAnd her fair eyes sweet smiling in delight âMoisten'd the fiery beams which forth they shot âWith well dissembl'd tears of orient pearls; âWhich like the starry beams on silent waves âGave a new lusture to her sparkling Orbs. Around her Couch flew little wanton Boys Scatt'ring perfumesâ&amp; fanning with their wings The glowing Dame. With amourous delight They often stoop'd, &amp; kisst her vermiel lip; At which the Pow'r would smile ineffable: And as She smil'd fresh fragrance breath'd around. âAt her right hand a comely Person stood âClad in fair weeds, but foul disordered. âHer Garments looseâdisshevel'd was her hair. âIn her left hand a Cup of Gold She held, âAnd with her right a luscious fruit did squeeze âInto the precious Bowl; which from the breach âOf such a Wine-Press made the wine more sweet. She offer'd Me the Bowlâwhich from her hand With trembling haste I snatchtânor stood to taste, âBut dasht it to the ground.âWhereat Excess, âFor so the Dame was nam'd, was sorely wroth: âFor that same Bowl she never could amend. âAt this the wanton Pow'r was all aghast: âAnd this luxurious Bow'r, &amp; Palace bright 'Gan fade in beautyâCeas'd the various sounds Of Birds &amp; Music: And the Groves let fall Their fruits &amp; foliage, as when Autumn sweeps With chilling hand the pride of all the Year. F. Queen. The syren Pleasure thus o'ercome, say next, What other Perils hadst Thou to encounter? Sir Guyon. Queen thou shalt hearâwhen I had thus escap'd The snares of Sloth &amp; Pleasure by thine aid; Impatiently I wisht suspense from toil. With hasty feet I travers'd the wild Desart: When suddenly my onward step was stopt By ruder Scenes than ever Eye beheld, Or darkest Fancy figur'd: For I came âInto a gloomy Glade, untrodden, wild; âCover'd with deadly shrubs from light of Heav'n. âThere sitting in the secret shade I found, âA meagre Salvage, &amp; uncivil Wight âOf griesly hue, &amp; foul ill favour'd mein. âHis Coat of Mail, all over grown with rust, âCover'd a Vest enveloped with gold: âAnd round about him lay, on ev'ry side, âHuge heaps of Goldâsome purify'd, some Ore.â âWho? &amp; what art Thou? tremblingly I cry'd.â âMammon! said heâThe God whom All adore. âIf Me thou deign to serve, at thy command âShall all things beâfor I can all things give. âTo whom I answer'dââAll thy gifts I scorn; âFor they debase the high-aspiring Mind: âFirst got with guilt, &amp; then preserv'd with dread: âCause of all harms, &amp; Mischiefs, Wars, &amp; Death. To Me the Carle in wrothââWhy then O! Wretch! âAre mortal Men so fond &amp; indiscreet âThese Evil things to seek with so much care? âThese having, dont complain?ânot having weep?â âMammon! said I, scorn'd are thy heaps of Wealth: âAn higher Bliss before mine eyes I place, âAnother happiness, another End: âAnd to be Lord of those who Riches have, âPrefer to have Myself, &amp; be their Slave. He gnasht his gum-deserted teeth, &amp; growl'd: Then open'd all his Treasures to my view Of countless forms, &amp; measure infinite. See here! says he, This World of wealth is thine If Me thou worship as thy only God.â Enrag'd I seiz'd a golden Mace that lay Close to the Cave where much of Pelf was hid: And as the rav'nous Caitif bent him down, With haggard eye to view his countless Stores; I struck him on the Neck a deadly blow: Headlong he fell in that accursed hole. On him I tumbl'd down huge heaps of Treasure; And bury'd him in that pernicious Ore. Then threw the golden Mace upon the heap; Nor brought one Ingot of his Pelf away.â No sooner light I saw, than, Gracious Queen! Appear'd thy promis'd Omen of Return. Thrice having washt Me in the running stream, In pure ablution, Queen! with thy permission, I am return'dâ&amp; wait thy benediction. F. Queen. I wellcome thy Returnâ&amp; give my blessing. Toils such as thine O! Fairy Son! deserve The palm of Vict'ry.âDangers now are past: Thy race of Glory run, behold the Goal! And this, the fair Reward of all thy Toils. Take Herâ&amp; know, a richer never yet The Gods have giv'n, or can Man receive. [giving him Florimel's hand] Sir Guyon. As such I take itâvowing on this hand, By tenderness, &amp; love, to merit it.â Duke. Most gracious Queen! Permit Me, in thy presence, To ask forgiveness of this peerless Maid: [to Florimel] And Madam! next of you [to the Duchess] I, for a while, Forgot my state, &amp; Dutyâsin'd in thought: But now, recover'd from the mazy Error, Like one but fresh awake from dreadful dreams, I strive to recollect my former State, To know what then I was, &amp; what I should be. F. Queen. I know it allâ&amp; and tho' you are not blameless; Yet 'twas decreed, Her Virtue should be try'd. Duchess. Since things are so decreedâ&amp; so we trespass; That pardon You receive as I expect, Should my feet slip upon Temptation's ice. Come, my good Lord! the vows we ne'er have broke, Let Us both jointly swear we never will; And, in one even tenor, let us round The circle of our duty. Duke. âLet Resolve, On either part, supply the form of oath. Florimel. O! let Me breathe my pray'r on your Resolves: I pardon the offence that try'd my Virtue. Duke. Excellent Florimel! accept my thanks! Receive my blessing, warmer from the heart, Than was the wish that offer'd the offence. Cupid. I'll swear for Allâ&amp; truly I've a Charm Will do, instead of formal oath, or promise. F. Queen. Indeed he hasâI know his powerful spell. Duke. What spell hath this same Yonker then to boast? Fain would I know him, &amp; his high pretensions. Cupid. Briefly you shallâI'll slough this skin of guile, And soon inform You, who, &amp; what I am. Exit Cupid. Duchess. This little Sphynx will now expound his riddle. And clear the Mystery that hung around him. Duke. His 'haviour o'ertops his seeming state. The rude husk slipt, I fancy we shall find, A Nut of rarest quality within. Duchess. So fancy I.âI think we soon shall see This little Bug slip skin, &amp; shake his wings. [Cupid Re-enters in his proper dress.] Duchess. New feathers make new BirdsâIs this the Linnet That charm'd Us with his song in russet Plumes? He now appears the Bird of Paradise. Cupid. Madam! the same.âNow moulted are those plumes, Of russet hue; &amp; I appear Myself, To give my benediction to this Pair.â You see before You nowâThe God of Love. Duchess. Wonderful change! just Sir! what you suspected. Duke. I thought that under those grey plumes was hid A Bird of choicest feather, note, &amp; Name. F. Queen. Our Drama then is finisht.âNought but joy Should now ride triumph on each friendly heart: Let Us all join to gratulate this Pair. Sir Guyon. First let Me gratulate my noble Friend And thank him, from my soul, for kindness shewn, While I was absent, to this charming Maid. Fiducio. This moment gives Me the reward I ask: For, in your happiness, I find my own. [To Florimel, &amp; Sir Guyon] Duke. We all rejoice.âSir Guyon! Florimel! Deign to make this your Court, to solemnize Your festival of BlissâWe'll play the Host While You preside at Cupid's feast of Love. Cupid. The secret now reveal'dâI take my flight, On jocund pinions to the Realms of Light. But ere I go, this Precept leave behind; Virtue's alone the Cestus of the Mind: That Florimels alone deserve the Band, In ev'ry Clime, as well as Fairy-Land. And may each Fair this sacred precept hit, That when She trys the Cestus it may fit.â Here end my Task &amp; TaleâBut tho' I ween, These are the dealings of The Fairy Queen; Yet after Ages shall our Story tell: And each Sir Guyon find a Florimel. Exeunt Omnes. FINIS</field>
