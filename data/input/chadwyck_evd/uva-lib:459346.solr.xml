      <field name="fulltext">ActÂ«uÂ» Scena i Enter Sir Griffin Meriddock of Sowales, &amp; Ieffreyow S. Griffin. Powesse, in vayne perswadste thou patience, In vayne thou dream'ste of lykely remedies, In vayne thouÂ«eÂ»lst of this or that conceit. winde breathÂ«eÂ»woordes, are vayner then the winde, Only our wepons must effect our weale. Powesse As hitherto my Lord I haue entreatred, So for a whyle, I pray ye be aduisde. S. Griffin. Aduisde? why what aduise can Powesse yeeld? Is not Sidanen with the Earles consent, and Prince Llwellens graunt, affyed to Moorton? Powesse. yea, so Pembrooke hath their graunt for Marian: But. S. Griffin. But what? Euen while we thus stand wasting idle woordes, Pembrook and Moorton shall possesse our looues. Our looues exclaime against our cowardise, Our cowardise to our eternal shame, In England wales &amp; Scotland shall be sung, by euery iygging mate, our foes among. Powesse. Nor English, welshe or Scottish shall reprooue, Lord Ieffrey Powesse with base cowardise. As much (Prince Griffin) as the proudest dare dares Powesse for his Marians libertie. yet not with rashnes or vnbrideled heat, discretion must be vsde, the cause is great. S. Griffin. Great cause indeed, when fayre Sidanens eyes, dimde with the sourse of her continuall teares, mixing those teares amongst the mournefull ynck, That writ the cause of her lament and mine, seemes in this paper weeping to intreat: And then no meruayle though the cause be great he shewes letter Powesse. But greater cause, our countreyes cause I meane, If we should manage Â«aÂ»rmes, as you still vrge, And so by force, from noble Chesters Courte, agaynst his will, fetche our well-willing looues; we may be held as traytours to the King, that durst inuade his townes in time of peace. S. Griffin. To see how Powesse casts beyond the Moone, As if the King would deale in these affayres. Or if he did, ist like his Maiestie, would suffer fathers by compelling awe: to force their children from their soules affect? Powesse. But if his highnesse subiects should be slayne, as in rough rescue it must needes fall out, he will not haue the meanest guiltlesse dye: but blood for blood shall duely be repayde. S. Griffin. Then Powesse, least such daunger should betyde: you are content the Ladyes shall be lost? Powesse. Not so Prince Griffin, then I would haue stayd, and not haue come so neere to Chesters Courte. S. Griffin. Bir Lady Sir, and we are much the neere. we two belyke, by your complotting wit, shall front the Earle of Chester in his Courte, And spight of Chesters strong inhabitants, Thorow west chester, meekely in our handes, lead my Sidanen and your Marian, while bothe our Riualles, and their following trayne, Sheeplyke stand shiuering at our wrathfull lookes. Beshrewe me, but ye haue a passing head, All natrall are your reasons, full of sence. Powesse. If we obtayne them, youle leaue iesting tÂ«hÂ»en S. Griffin. yea that I will. But can ye tell me whe? Enter Sr. Gosselin denvyle, Sr. Euan Griff, and IÂ«?Â» Gosselen what Â«??????????????Â» ord haue company, Â«tÂ»rust will purge your melancholly. welcom Gentlemen, you seeme no lesse, be not offended at my salutations, that bid ye stand, before I say God speed. ffor in playne tearmes, speed what your speed may be, Such coyne you haue, bothe must and shall with me. S. Griffin. How now Lord Ieffrey? what companion haue we heere? he seemes some theefe. Iohn. No theefe Sir, but an honest bon companion. Nere drawe your weapons, rather trust your feete, And yet ye cannot hence, but at my pleasure. what needes all this? yeeld, if I bid ye yeeld. Powesse. Thou shouldst be Iohn a Kent, thou art so peremptorie, for Iohn a Kent is a bolde merry knaue. Iohn Tis happie then he is no very knaue. I am the man, what say ye to Iohn a Kent? Powesse I am Ieffrey Lord Powesse, thy maisters freend, And this Sr. Griffin Meriddock, Prince of Southwales. Iohn. why then I knowe ye bothe, and welcome bothe, Mr. these are the guests you looke for, whom had I not well gest at, they had for welcome got a cudgelling. Gosselen. welcome my Lord, and welcome noble Prince. Powesse. Thankes good Sr. Gosselen denvyle, and Sr. Euan Griffin, I trust the men you promisde me are readie. Gosselen. ffor my parte, seuen score bowemen, wight and tall, haue I lodgde in the woode, nere to the riuer of dee. Euan. And I threescore as strong, with hookes and billes, that to three hundred will not turne their backs. Powesse. But can ye tell vs any newes from Chester? Iohn. Colde newes for you my Lordes, there is at Chester, The Earle of Pembrooke, and the Scottish Moorton, the one shall haue Llwellens fayre Sidanen, the other Marian, good olde Chesters daughter. and bothe these weddings finished to morrowe. Griffin. No more of that my freend, thou sleyst me wt h these newe. hearst thou this Powesse? this did I foredoome: now all your wise deuises come too late. Gosselen Content ye good my Lord, no whit too late, heere is a lad on whom we doo relye, for slye conueyaunce of the Ladyes hither, full of conceit he is, and deeply seene, Â«iÂ»n secret artes, to woork for your auayle. . Griffin. Canst thou my freend, from foorth the vaultes beneathe, call vp the ghostes of those long since deceast? Or from the vpper region of the ayre: fetche swift wingde spirits to effect thy will? Iohn. Can you my Lord, and you, and you, and you, goe to the venson, for your suppers drest: and afterward goe lay ye downe to rest? Powesse how then sweet Iohn? all this thou knowest we can, and what thou canst we haue no doubt at all: but what thou wilt, that gladly would we learne. Iohn. I will to morrow bring you Marian, and you Prince Griffin your beloou'de Sidanen. will this content ye? S. Griffin As all the world cannot content me more. Iohn. why then I pray ye be content to goe, And frollick cheerely, for it shall be so Gosselen. I warrant ye my Lords, come let vs in. exeunt. Ihn. So, they must banquet, I vnto my busines. But let me muse a little on this looue, full of many feares, so sundry ioyes, now hence, now hither diuersly distract, Â«????????????????????????Â» But Iohn a Kent what talkest thou rather minde thou the pleasing ioyese. And since so good a subiect they present, vppon these loouers practise thou thy wit. help, hinder, giue, take back, turne, ouerturne, deceiue, bestowe, breed pleasure, discontent. yet comickly conclude, like Iohn a Kent. exit. Enter at one doore Ranulphe Earle of Chester, Oswen his sonÂ«nÂ» young Amery Lord Mortaigue, wt h them the Countesse, her daught Marian, and fayre Sidanen. At another doore enter the Earles Pembrooke, Moorton and their trayne. Moorton. All health be to the noble Earle of Chester, his Countesse and these honorable Ladyes, whom one by one I humbly gratulate, wishing to them their happy hartes content. Pemb. The Lyke dooth Pembrook to this goodly trayne. Chester. Earle Moorton, and my noble Lord of Pembrooke, whose presence bringes contentment to my soule and adds true honor to your noble names: for hauing kept your vowes inuiolate, how you are welcome, woordes shall not explaine, but such as best beseemes your entertaine. [your father Madame, will be heere this night,] [Or early in the morning, well I wot,] [ffor such prouision hath he sent before,] [as shewes him selfe will not be farre behinde.] And sith it is our auncient Englishe guyse, the Bridegroomes should vppon the wedding day, come from some distant place to fetche their Brydes, my house at [S[illeg.]ey] Plessye is for you preparde. Thence to the Castell shall [ye] you walke along And at St Iohns shall be sollemnized, the nuptialles of your honors, and these virgens. ffor to that Churche, Edgar, once Englands King, was by eight Kinges, conquerd by him in warres: rowed royally on St. Iohn Baptist day. In memory of which pompe, the Earles our auncestours, haue to that Churche beene noble benefactours. Moorton Eight Kings rowe one? that was great pompe indeed. Pemb. One of them was of Scotland, as I read, the Irishe, and the dane two more besyde, and fiue of Brittayne, all subdued by him. To see that Church will greatly ioy my minde, because I there a greater ioy shall fynde. Moorton. why lookes Sidanen sad? why sighes she so? Sidanen Pardon my Lord, such thinges you may not knowe. Moorton She not mislykes her choyse I hope of me. Sidanen No God forbid. although you are not he. /asyde. Moorton. why then looke cheerly, as Sidanen should, Sidanen. I doo my Lord. And better if I could. asyde. Pemb. Madame, the Scottish Lord hath got a gracious looke, but Pembrooke is not halfe so happy yet. Oswen. Sister, you wrong the noble Earle with frownes Amery My Lord content ye, women fayne dislyke, where their affections beare the higest regard. Marian You are too young my Lord, to iudge so soundly, Amery I finde it writ by them that iudgde profoundly Marian Bookes may beguyle ye. Oswen. My Lord, that cut came roundly. Pemb. Your sadnes tell, if I may knowe the cause, Marian. Me thinkes my Lord the custome is too hard, when loouers meet, so suddenly to parte, Pemb. To morrowes ioy will end that bitter smart, Marian To see ye no more, how would it ease my hart? /asyde Chester well noble Lordes, for this time break we of, Sonne and Lord Amery, you will be their guyde. Oswen. yea my good Lord, then goe we Gentlemen. exeunt. Countesse Sida &amp; Â«MaÂ», d Cossen, now we are alone, Let treat to knowe the secret cause, that mooues these passions more then ouerpensiue, which were not wunt in you to woorke such chaunge. If in my power to councell, or preuent, there rest a meane, let me but knowe your mindes, and what I may shall surely be effected, to either of your longing harts, content. Sydanan. Madame, your tender care and kinde affect, assures Sidanen of your honors faith. In breefe my noble Aunte, this is the cause, why poore Sydanen is disconsolate, That she must leaue her countrey and her kinne, and passe to Scotland with the Earle of Moorton. Countesse Cossen, his kindnesse soone will calme this greefe, and therfore cast these cares behinde thy back. But what olde man is this comes toward vs? Enter Iohn a Kent like an aged Hermit Iohn. Ladyes, if crooked age, and homely weedes, breed not contempt, vouchsafe I humbly pray, your charitable comfort to sustayne, a little longer these spent withred limbes, that numbde through chilnesse of my frost-bit blood, which six score winters hath resisted stormes, and iust so many times the summers heate. Now quaking lyke the winde-blowen bough for strength, witnesse that all thinges yeeld to time at length. Countesse. how much I greeue that these thy siluer hayres, should in extreamest age feele taste of want, And this thy furrowed face, with teares distaynd, shall well appeare: ffor thou shalt in wt h vs. These feeble limbes with age so ouerworne, shall fynde repose, and not be left forlorne. Marian. ffather, receiue this little gifte of me. giue him somewhaÂ«tÂ» Sydanen. And heere olde man, take this to comfort thee. Iohn. As [may] many blessings light vppon you three, as cares and crosses haue befalne to me. But much I feare, if arte may iudge aright some ill is toward these twayne this present night. Sydanen what sayst thou father? art thou a man of skill? Iohn. Lady, in youth I studyed hidden artes, and proffited in Chiromancye much, Â«IÂ»f sight be not obscurde through natures weaknesse, I can, for once I could discourse by fauour, and rules of palmistrie ensuing chaunces. Marian Good ffather tell my fortune if thou canst. Sydanen Nay mine I pray thee first, I askte thee first. Iohn. Striue not fayre Ladyes, shewe me bothe your handes for your complexions seeme to be alyke. Nay let me see, bothe your affections are alyke. he sees their handes Blush not, but tell me, are ye not bothe betrothde, to two great Lordes, without your parents knowledge? Countesse They are betrothde indeed, but with their parents knowledge, and bothe to morrow must be maryed. Iohn. Now God forbid, woes me to thinke theron. Countesse. why father?

Countesse. ffather, I haue some reason to beleeue thee, by what I must keep secret to my selfe, And but my Lord condemnes these auncient rules, religiously obserued in these partes: I would craue leaue for them to trauell thither, for many haue misdoone that did it not. Sydanen rather then hard mishap should vs befall, twere good we were acquainted therwithall. Marian. Good mother, this fayre euening let vs goe, weele come agayne before my father knowe. Countesse well, goe ye shall, and I along with ye, had we some trusty freend to be our guyde.

And if your honors deigne so olde a guyde: So speed my soule as shall to you betyde. Countesse. None better. But what houre of night is best? Iohn. when twise two houres the daughters of the night, haue driuen their Eban chariot thorow the ayre, and with their duskie winges breathde calmie rest, vppon the eyeliddes of eche liuing thing: The siluer shyning horned lamp dooth rise, by whose cleere light we may discerne the pathe, wherin though lamely now I seeme to plod yet will I guyde ye safely to the spring.

Thats as Sydanen will, as I suppose Sydanen will I, or nill I, all is one to him, he is a Prince, and he hath promisde it. Iohn. you are a Princesse, and haue promisde no. Sydanen. Earle Moorton with my father is in fauour, and hath his woord, that I shalbe his wife. Iohn. But hath he yours? Sydanen. Neuer in all my Life. Iohn.

Pray God this talke to our desyre may tend. Iohn. But would you goe with him, if he were heere? Sydanen would I desyre to be accounted chaste? reuerenst for virtue, as for natrall giftes? wouÂ«dÂ» I aske strength for these my feeble limbes, if some fierce Tiger had me in pursuite? would I shun feare? would I require content? or wishe the endlesse happines of heauen? If these I would, then that as much I would. for what is fame, health, ioy, or ought to me, except with him that giues them all to me? Iohn. Madame enough, is Marian of your minde? Sydanen. yea father. She to Powesse, I to Prince Griffin writ, but when no answere either could receiue, resoluedly thus we set downe our rest.

Sydanen. And if Sydanen willingly departe, from her prince Griffin, ioy nere haue her hart. Powesse. I hope my Marian is of selfe same minde, Marian. Else were thy looue requited too vnkinde. Now mother, would you were at home agayne, we bothe are where we wisht our selues full fayne. Countesse.

Heer's looue and looue, Good Lord, was nere the lyke, but must these ioyes so quickly be concluded? Must the first Scene make absolute a play? no crosse? no chaunge? what? no varietie? One brunt is past, alas, whats that in looue? where firme affection is moste truely knit, the looue is sweetest, that moste tryes the wit. And by my troth, to sporte my selfe awhyle, The disappoynted Brydegroomes, these possesst, the fathers, freendes, and other more besyde, that may be vsde to furnishe vp conceite, Ile set on woorke in such an amourous warre, as they shall wunder whence ensues this iarre. O that I had some other lyke my selfe, to driue me to sound pollicyes indeed. Thers one in Scotland, tearmed Iohn a Cumber, that ouerreachte the deuill by his skill, had Moorton brought him to haue sped his looue, I would haue tryde which should the maister prooue.

Turnop. why then thus my muse hath magestically, or minstricallically written Â«??Â» in prayse of fayre Sydanen, and she beeing appoynted to be maryed this Â«??yÂ» she ought to haue the maydenhead of my muse, before she loose the benefÂ«??Â» abselutidico, as much to say in welsh or english, as her rose mary braunche. Spurling. But has will learnd it perfectly? I tell you, she is a Lady of some scression, and lookes that the song of Sydanen should be well performd Turnop. Goodman Spurling, though you be spurblinde, and therby are fauoured for the grosse errours c?mitted in your vocation; yet I pray ye, c?mit your selfe to your musique, as for the song, let it passe vppon my preroga- striue, w t h this addition, He mihi quod domino, non licet ire tuo Tom. when then tune all, for it drawes toward day; and if we wake not the Brydes, why then it is woorth nothing.

Lets talke a woord or two awhyle, I pray ye be quiet. did ye not yesternight disturb your head, wt h winum vinum ere ye went to bed? That makes ye in your sleep to rise and walke, or at the least, thus idiot lyke to talke? Enter the Earle of Chester in his night gowne, and Shrimpe following aloofe of, some seruaunts wt h him. Chester. Can their departure be to all vnknowen? Villaynes why speake ye not? did no one see them? [i. Seruaunt.] [Not any one my Lord that we can heare of.] [Belyke they went foorth at the garden gate,] [we found it open, therfore we suspect it.] Oswen. My Lord and father, are you vp so soone? where is my Sister? where is fayre Sydanen? Chester. ?Nay, wher's thy mother boy, aske that withall, for she, thy Sister, and my loouely Niece, this night are gon, and no one can tell whether. As I lay slumbring, well neere halfe awake, vnder my windowe did I heare a voyce, saying, rise Chester, for this wedding day, is disappointed now another way. Moorton. And in a Song, the lyke was tolde to vs, by these base slaues, that now deny the same. But yet my Lord, I hope it is not so? Chester. That they are gon my Lordes, tis true, I knowe. But camse these newes from you? why speake ye not? Hugh. Thomas, you are the auncient'st man, I pray ye make answer for vs all. Thomas My Lord, I hope it is not vnknowen to your woorships hor; that I haue liu'de a poore professer of musique in this parish this forty yeeres, and no man could euer burden me w t h the valewe of two pence, that ye should now lay three wenches at once to my charge, I will not say: how much it greeues me, but betweene God &amp; your conscience be it. Turnop. Nay but heare ye my Lord, doo ye as it were seeme in good sounÂ«dÂ» sadnes, to tell vs for a certaintie that the Brydes are gon? anÂ«dÂ» that we, as it were should haue some occasion to knowe therof? Chester. So say these Lordes, they lay it to your charge. Turnop. why then my Lordes bothe great and small, knowe that ye wrong not one, but all which way so ere they haue betooke them, If they be gon, you may goe looke them. And if they be not to be found, Â«yÂ»ou haue lost your wiues Ile holde ye a pound. Chester. Away then villaynes, rayse vp all my men, bid them take horsse, and poste foorth euery way. By some foule treason are they led from hence, My wife else would not wt h this faulte dispence. Away I say, and trouble vs no longer, exeunt clownes &amp; seruaunts.

Princely Llwellen, and my noble freend, hither thou c?mest by loyall promise bound, to sollemnise thy daughters nuptiall rightes But fayre Sydanen and Earle Chesters daughter[s], are with the aged Countesse parted hence, whether or how, as yet we cannot learne. Llwellen. why then my freend, thy tydings are too true, /to Iohn a Cumber. Pemb vnhappy man, is this my welcome hither? [Powesse] My Lord, can he say any thing of their departure? Speak gentle freend, and ease our doubtfull mindes. Cumber. Ease them I cannot, but disease them more, They are where you shall neuer see them more. Moorton. how meanste thou freend? dally not I beseeche thee. Cumber. Prince Griffin of Southwales hath got Sydanen, Lord Powesse hath your daughter Marian. And at Sr. Gosselen d?uyles Castell, not farre hence, Before your Countesse, who went with them thither: this day their mariage must be consumate. Chester. what sayst thou? hath my Countesse wrongd me so? and is this tretcherie by her consent? Cumber. No my good Lord, Knowe ye one Iohn a Kent? A man whom all this Brittishe Isle admyres: for his rare knowledge in the deepest artes? By pollicye he traynd them from this place, they simply thinking no such hidden guyle, but at Saint winifrides fayre hallowed spring, to pay last tribute of their mayden vowes, went with the Countesse, and that subtill guyde, So eache of you may now goe looke his Bryde. Llwellen. Let vs to horsse, and gather able troupes, that may engirt the Castell round about. Proud Griffin, Powesse, and the rest shall knowe, I will not pocket this iniurious wrong, which I will rate at price of their best blood, And his that hath so ouerreachte vs all. Cumber. ffye my good Lord, nay now ye growe too hot. talke ye of horsse, of men and multitudes? when rayse the very powerfulst strength ye can, yet all's too weak to deale with that one man? Had ye a freend could equall him in Arte, controll his cunning, which he boasts so on: then were there hope of their recouerie, what else ye doo, will help but slenderly. Moorton. Ile poste to Scotland for braue Iohn a Cumber, the only man renownde for magick skill. Oft haue I heard, he once beguylde the deuill, and in his Arte could neuer finde his matche. Come he with me, I dare say, Iohn a Kent, And all the rest shall this foule fact repent. Cumber. were he heere now my Lord, it would doo well. But if he come when euery thing is doone No credit by the matter can be wun. Chester. My Lord, goe you and fetche that famous man, The Prince and I will foorthwith to the Castell, where calling them to parle on the walles, wee'le promise that they shall enioy the Ladyes with our consent, if but a sennight space they will adiorne the day of mariage, sound reasons wee'le alleadge to vrge them to it. then you returnd with him that neuer faylde, you haue your wishe, and Iohn in cunning quaylde.

Ile make no bragges, but we two Iohns together, will tug for maistrie, therfore came I hither. Moorton. The welcomste man that euer came to me, all embrace him And this kinde looue will Moorton well requite ffor Gods sake let vs loose no time in vayne, tis broad day light, sweet Iohn bestirre thee now. for nere thy help could come in greater need.

Euan. yea, but the Countesse and the other Ladyes, I doubt were wearied with so late a walke. ffor as it seemes they are not stirring yet, And little kindnesse were it to disease them, before them selues think best to leaue their chamber. But say Prince Griffin, wheron doo ye muse? you not mislyke Sydanen is so neere? Nor you, that Marian beares her company. S. Griffin. Sir Euan, Ile be playne, &amp; tell ye what I thought.
