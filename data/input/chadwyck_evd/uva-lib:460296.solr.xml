      <field name="fulltext">THE FROGS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The greater part of this Play (the Frogs) had been printed upwards of twenty years ago, having been intended for private distribution; an intention to which the writer adheres, being unwilling to cancel what had been already printed and in part distributed; and being at the same time aware that the system of metrical notation here adopted is imperfect, inasmuch as no distinction is marked between the dominant and the minor accents, nor are the legitimate substitutes for the Iambic dipodium sufficiently indicatedâSuch as it is then, with this acknowledged imperfection, he ventures to present it to his friends and to his friends only, satisfied with having secured the existence of the text, upon which much time and attention had been bestowed, but without venturing to obtrude upon the public a work, (in its present form and appearance at least) avowedly defective.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bacchus, the patron of the Stage, in despair at the decline of the Dramatic Art (which had lately been deprived of its best Tragic Authors, Sophocles and Euripides) determines to descend the Infernal Regions, with the intention of procuring the release of Euripides. He appears accordingly, equipt for the expedition, with the lion's skin and club; (in imitation of Hercules, whose success in a similar adventure has encouraged him to the attempt) he still retains, however, his usual effeminate costume, which forms a contrast with these heroic attributes. Xanthias his slave (like Silenus, the mythologic attendant of Bacchus) is mounted upon an ass: but in conformity with the practice of other human slaves when attending their mortal masters upon an earthly journey, he carries a certain pole upon his shoulder, at the ends of which the various packages, necessary for his master's accommodation, are suspended in equilibrio. The first scene (which if it had not been the first, might perhaps have been omitted) contains a censure of the gross taste of the audience, (suitable to the character of Bacchus as patron of the stage) with allusions to some cotemporary rival authors, who submitted to court the applause of the vulgar by mere buffoonery.âThe argument between Bacchus and Xanthias, at the end of this scene, probably contains some temporary allusion now unknown, but is obviously, and in the first place, an humorous exemplification of the philosophical, verbal sophismsânot, in all probability, new, even then; but which were then, for the first time, introduced in Athens, and which may be traced from thence to the schoolmen of the middle ages.âXanthias carries the bundles passivÃ¨ et formaliterâthe Ass carries them activÃ¨ et materialiter. Bacchus. Xanthias. X. MÃ ster, shall Ã begÃ¬n with the Ã¹sual JÃ²kes, That the AÃ¹dience Ã lways lÃ ugh at? B. Ãf you plÃ¨ase? Any JÃ²ke you please, excÃ¨pt âbeing Ã²verbÃ¹rthen'd.â âDon't Ã¹se it yÃ¨tâWe've tÃ¬me enoÃ¹gh befÃ²re us. X. Well, sÃ²mething Ã¨lse that's cÃ²mical and clÃ¨ver? B. I forbÃ¬d being âÃ²verprÃ¨st and Ã²verbÃ¹rthen'd.â X. WÃ¨ll, but the drÃ²llest JÃ²ke of Ã llâ? B. RemÃ¨mber There's Ã²ne thing I protÃ¨st agaÃ¬nstâ X. What's thÃ t? B. Why shÃ¬fting Ã²ff your lÃ²ad to the Ã²ther shÃ²ulder, And fÃ¬dgeting Ã nd complÃ ining of the grÃ¬pes. X. What thÃ¨n do you mÃ¨an to sÃ y, that I mÃ¹st not sÃ y That I'm rÃ¨ady to befoÃ¹l mysÃ¨lf?! B. [peremptorily.] By nÃ² means. ExcÃ¨pt when I tÃ ke an EmÃ¨tic. As a filthy joke might assist the operation of the medicine. X. [in a sullen muttering tone, as if resentful of hard usage.] WhÃ t's the Ã¹se, then, Of m? being bÃ¹rthen'd hÃ¨re with Ã ll these bÃ¹ndles, If Ã'm to be deprÃ¬v'd of the cÃ²mmon JÃ²kes That Phrynichus, and Lycis, and AmÃ¨ipsias Xanthias considers these jokes as the lawful vails and perquisites of servants on such occasions. AllÃ²w the sÃ¨rvants Ã lways in their CÃ²medies, WithoÃ¹t excÃ¨ption, when they cÃ rry bÃ¹ndles. B. Pray leÃ ve them Ã²ffâfor thÃ²se ingÃ¨nious sÃ llies Have sÃ¹ch an effÃ¨ct upon my hÃ¨alth and spÃ¬rits, That I feÃ¨l grown Ã²ld and dÃ¹ll when I get hÃ²me. X. [as before] Its hÃ rd for mÃ¨ to sÃ¹ffer in my lÃ¬mbs, or with a sort of half mutinous whine. To be Ã²verbÃ¹rthen'd, and debÃ rr'd from jÃ²king. B. Well! thÃ¬s is mÃ²nstrous qÃ¹ite, and Ã¬nsuppÃ²rtable; Such Ã¬nsolence in a sÃ¨rvantâWhÃ¨n your MÃ ster Is gÃ²ing afoÃ²t, and has provÃ¬ded yÃ²u With a bÃ¨ast to cÃ rry ye. X. WhÃ t! do I cÃ rry nÃ²thing? B. You're cÃ rried yoursÃ¨lf. X. But I cÃ rry bÃ¹ndles, dÃ²n't I? B. But the bÃ¨ast bears Ã ll the bÃ¹ndles that you cÃ rry. X. Not thÃ²se that I cÃ rry mysÃ¨lfâ'tis Ã that cÃ rry 'em. B. You're cÃ rried yoursÃ¨lf, I tÃ¨ll ye. X. I cÃ n't explÃ in it, But I fÃ¨el it in my shÃ²ulders plÃ inly enÃ²ugh. B. WÃ¨ll, if the beÃ st don't hÃ¨lp youâtÃ ke and tr?; Change plÃ ces with the Ã ss and cÃ rry hÃ¬m. X. Oh dÃ¨ar! I wÃ¬sh I had gÃ²ne for a vÃ²luntÃ¨er, Numbers of the slaves, at that time had been enfranchised, on condition of naval service. And lÃ¨ft you to yoursÃ¨lf. I wÃ¬sh I hÃ d. X. In a tone of mere disgust. Xanthias is wearied out by mere petulance and folly, not with hard usage. B. DismoÃ¹nt you RÃ scal; hÃ¨re We're at the hoÃ¹se Where HÃ¨rcules livÃ¨s.âHollÃ²h, there; whÃ²'s withÃ¬n there. [Bacchus kicks outrageously at the door. Hercules, Bacchus, Xanthias. H. Who's thÃ¨re? (He has bÃ ng'd at the doÃ²r, whoÃ¨ver he Ã¬s, With the kÃ¬ck of a CÃ¨ntaur. The expression is characteristic. The Centaur being a familiar beast to Hercules) What's the mÃ tter thÃ¨re? B. [aside.] Ha? XÃ nthias? X. WhÃ t? B. [aside.] Did ye mÃ¬nd how hÃ¨ was frighten'd? X. I suppÃ²se he was afrÃ id you were gÃ²ing mÃ d. H. [aside.] By JÃ²ve I shall laÃ¹gh outrÃ¬ght; I'm rÃ¨ady to bÃ¹rst. I shall laÃ¹gh in spÃ¬te of mysÃ¨lf, upon my lifÃ¨. [Hercules shifts about, and turns aside to disguise his laughter: this apparent shyness confirms Bacchus in the opinion of his own ascendancy, which he manifests accordingly. B. Come hÃ¬ther friÃ¨nd.âWhat aÃ¬ls ye? StÃ¨p this wÃ y, I wÃ nt to spÃ¨ak to yÃ¨. B. With a tone of protection. H. But I cÃ n't help laÃ¹ghing,â To sÃ¨e the LÃ¬on's skÃ¬n with a sÃ ffron RÃ²be,â And the ClÃ¹b, with the wÃ²men's SÃ ndalsâÃ ltogÃ¨therâ What's the mÃ¨aning of it Ã ll?âHave you bÃ¨en abrÃ²ad? H. With a good-humoured but unsuccessful endeavour to supress laughter, or to conceal itâsuppose him for instance speaking with his hand before his mouth. B. I've bÃ¨en aboÃ rdâin the FlÃ¨etâwith ClÃ¨isthenes. H. [sharply and ironically.] You foÃ¹ghtâ? B. [briskly and sillily.] YÃ¨s! thÃ t we dÃ¬dâwe gÃ in'd a vÃ¬ctory; And we sÃ¹nk the Ã¨nemies shÃ¬psâthirtÃ¨en of 'Ã¨m. H. âSo you wÃ²ke at lÃ st, and foÃ¹nd it wÃ s a drÃ¨am A proverbial sarcasm by which the auditor of an improbable story affects to suppose that the narrator has been relating a dream.â?â B. But aboÃ rd the flÃ¨et, as I pursÃ¹ed my stÃ¹dies, I rÃ¨ad the TrÃ gedy of AndrÃ²medÃ ; A play of Euripides's. And thÃ¨n such a vÃ¨hement pÃ ssion strÃ¹ck my heÃ rt, You cÃ n't imÃ gine. H. A smÃ ll one, I suppÃ²se, My lÃ¬ttle fÃ¨llowâa mÃ²derate lÃ¬ttle pÃ ssion? B. It's jÃ¹st as smÃ ll as MÃ²lon Ã¬sâthat's Ã llâ MÃ²lon the WrÃ¨stler, I mÃ¨anâas smÃ ll as HÃ¨ isâ Molon was remarkable for his bulk and stature. B. Ironically.âThe irony of imbecillity.â H. Well, whÃ t was it lÃ¬ke? What kÃ¬nd of a thÃ¬ng? what wÃ s it? B. No, friÃ¨nd, you mÃ¹st not laÃ¹ghâit's pÃ st a jÃ²ke; It's quÃ¬te a sÃ¨rious feÃ¨lingâqÃ¹ite distrÃ¨ssing; I sÃ¹ffer frÃ²m itâ B. Meaning to be very serious and interesting. H. [bluntly.] WÃ¨ll, explÃ in. What wÃ s it? B. I cÃ n't declÃ re it at Ã²nce; but Ã'll explÃ in it TheÃ tricÃ lly and Ã¨nigmÃ ticÃ llyâ âWere you Ã¨ver sÃ¨iz'd with a sudden pÃ ssionate lÃ²nging For a mÃ¨ss of pÃ²rridge?â B. With a buffoonish assumption of Tragic gesture and emphasis. H. Ãften enoÃ¹gh, if thÃ t's all. B. Shall I stÃ te the mÃ tter to you plÃ inly at Ã²nce; Or pÃ¹t it cÃ¬rcumlÃ²cutÃ²rily? A ridicule of the circuitous preambles to confidential communications in Tragedy. H. Not abÃ²ut the pÃ²rridge. I Ã¹nderstÃ nd your Ã¬nstance B. âSÃ¹ch is the pÃ ssion that possÃ¨sses mÃ¨ For poor Euripides, that's dead and gone; And it's Ã ll in vÃ in people tr?ing to persÃ¹ade me From gÃ²ing Ã fter him. H. WhÃ t to the shÃ des belÃ²w? B. YÃ¨s, to the shÃ des belÃ²w, or the shÃ des benÃ¨ath 'em. To the Ã¹ndermost shÃ des of Ã ll.âI'm qÃ¹ite detÃ¨rmin'd. H. But whÃ t's your Ã²bject? B. Wh? my Ã²bject Ã¬s, That I wÃ nt a clÃ¨ver pÃ²etââfor the gÃ²od âThe gracious and the good, are dead and gone; âThe worthless and the weak are left alive.â B. With a ridiculous imitation of tragical action and emphasis. The quotation is from Euripides. H. Is not IÃ²phon a gÃ²od one?âHÃ¨'s alÃ¬ve sure? B. If HÃ¨'s a goÃ²d one, HÃ¨'s our Ã²nly gÃ²od one; But it's a quÃ¨stion Ã'm in doÃ¹bt aboÃ¹t him. B. Upon the subject of his own profession, Bacchus talks in a tone approaching very nearly to sense and consistency, and is treated by Hercules with more respect. H. There's SÃ²phocles;âHe's Ã²lder than EurÃ¬pidesâ âIf you gÃ² so fÃ r for 'emâYou'd bÃ¨st bring hÃ¬m. B.

The author has condescended to gratify the popular taste alluded to in the First Scene, without entrenching upon the pure humour of his dialogue. Throughout the preceding scene, Xanthias acts a part in dumb show, exhibiting various attitudes and contortions of weariness, and restlessness: his impatience breaks out in four interruptions, three of which are so managed, as to produce a Comic effect. In the first, Xanthias puts himself in a ridiculous juxtaposition with Pythangelus; the second terminates a discussion proverbially endless; and the last enables Hercules to put an end to a dialogue (which would otherwise have been too long) with an air of brevity and dispatch suited to his character. Hercules and Bacchus offer a contrast of the two extremes of manly and feeble character. Strength is represented in a state of calmness and playful repose; and feebleness in a paroxysm of occasional energy, conformably to the practice of ancient artists in their serious compositions. The dialogue with the Deadman, besides its merit as an incomparable sample of humourous nonsense, has the advantage of introducing the spectators in imagination to the very suburbs of the infernal Regions; for if we look to the strict localities of the stage, nothing else intervenes between the dialogue at the door of Hercules's house (in Thebes, as the Scholiast supposes) and the passage of the Styx, which immediately follows.

Well, gÃ¬ve me the wÃ²rd and the tÃ¬me. Ch. Whooh up Ã¹p, Whooh up Ã¹p. Chorus of Frogs. This Chorus, from the clutter of cognate consonants g, k, and ch, which appears in some parts of it, should seem to have been intended by the author as a caricature of some cotemporary dramatical Lyrics. With the assistance of the Northumbrian bur, some of the lines may be made to croak with very tolerable effect: others should seem intended as a contrast, and contain some pretty imagery.âThe spelling of the words of the Chorus, is accommodated to the actual pronunciation of the Frogs, which, it is presumed, has remained unaltered. The B in the Brekeke-kÃ¨sh is very soft and assimilates to the V. The e in kesh is pronounced like ei in Leisure, and the last syllable prolonged and accented with a higher tone. The word as commonly pronounced by scholars (with the ictus or English accent on the 3d syllable) bears no resemblance to the sound which it is meant to imitate; which has, on the contrary, a slight ictus on the 1st syllable.âThe learned reader is requested to estimate the truth of this translation, not by direct collation with the text of the original, but by those impressions of its general spirit and effect which may remain in his memory, or (more fairly still) by a reference to the assignable or supposeable effects intended to be produced by the original.

O the Frogs, consume and rot'em, I've a blister on my bottom. Hold your tongues, you tuneful Creatures. Frogs. Cease with your profane intreaties, All in vain for ever striving; Silence is against our natures. With the Vernal heat reviving, Our aquatic Crew repair From their periodic sleep, In the dark and chilly deep, To the cheerful Upper Air; Then we frolic here and there All amidst the Meadows fair; Shady plants of Asphodel, Are the Lodges where we dwell; Chaunting in the leafy Bowers All the livelong Summer Hours, Till the sudden gusty showers Send us headlong, helter skelter, To the Pool to seek for shelter; Meagre, Eager, Leaping Lunging, From the sedgy Wharfage plunging To the tranquil depth below, There we muster all a-row; Where, secure from toil and trouble, With a tuneful Hubble Bubble, Our symphonious accents flow. BrÃ¨keke-kÃ¨sh, KoÃ sh, KoÃ sh. B. I forbid you to proceed. Frogs. That would be severe indeed, Arbitrary, bold, and rash. BrÃ¨keke-kÃ¨sh, KoÃ sh, KoÃ sh. B.

The proper Chorus, consisting of the votaries of Bacchus, now appears upon the stage; or more properly speaking, on the orchestra; (a platform in front of the stage, but of inferior elevation) a circumstance which (as Schlegel has justly observed) has been wholly overlooked in all attempts to introduce a Chorus upon the modern stage, on which it is impossible for them to appear without embarrassing the actors and distracting the attention of the Spectators.âIt is much to be regretted that the explanations which Mr. Schlegel has given of the local arrangement of the ancient stage (a subject on which he seems to have very clear ideas) have not been accompanied with graphic illustrations which would make them equally intelligible to his Readers. The following scene is a humourous representation of the concluding ceremony of the Eleusinian mysteries, on the last day of which the worship of Bacchus, under the invocation of Iacchus, was united with that of Ceres. Iacchus seems to have been the last Avatar of the worship of Bacchus, as Pan was the first. For an account of the character of this worship, and its extreme discrepancy from that of Ceres, with which it was united in this festival, see the learned and original work of Mr. Ouvaroff, which has been lately translated and illustrated by Mr. Christie. It is to be observed that though the votaries are celebrating the rites of Bacchus, Bacchus being disguised and incognito, or not considering himself concerned in the invocation of Iacchus, does not take any notice of them as his votaries or adherents.

Raise the fiery Torches high! Bacchus is approaching nigh, Like the Planet of the Morn, Breaking with the hoary Dawn, On the dark solemnityâ âThere they flash upon the sight; All the Plain is blazing bright, Flush'd and overflown with Light: Age has cast his Years away, And the Cares of many a day, Sporting to the lively Layâ Mighty Bacchus! March and Lead (Torch in Hand toward the Mead) Thy devoted humble Chorus, Mighty BacchusâMove before us! Semichorus. Keep SilenceâKeep Peaceâand let all the Profane From our holy solemnity duly refrain; Whose souls unenlighten'd by taste, are obscure; Whose poetical notions are dark and impure; Whose theatrical conscience Is sullied by nonsense; Who never were train'd by the mighty Cratinus Cratinus, doubly a votary of Bacchus, as a dramatic poet and a hard drinker. In mystical Orgies poetic and vinous; Who delight in buffooning and jests out of season; Who promote the designs of oppression and treason; Who foster sedition, and strife, and debate; All Traitors, in short, to the Stage and the State; Who surrender a Fort, or in private, export To Places and Harbours of hostile resort, Clandestine consignments of cables and pitch; In the way that Neither the Scholiasts nor commentators give us any information respecting Thorycion, except that he had a command at Egina.Thorycion grew to be rich From a scoundrelly dirty Collector of Tribute: All such we reject and severely prohibit: All Statesmen retrenching the fees and the salaries Of theatrical bards, in revenge for the railleries, And jests, and lampoons, of this holy solemnity, Profanely pursuing their personal enmity, For having been flouted, and scoff'd, and scorn'd, All such are admonish'd and heartily warn'd; We warn them once, We warn them twice, We warn and admonishâwe warn them thrice, To conform to the Law, To retire and withdraw; While the Chorus again with the formal saw, (Fixt and assign'd to the festive day) Move to the measure and March away. Semichorus. March! March! Lead forth, Lead forth manfully, March in order all; Bustling, Hustling, Justling, As it may befall; Flocking, Shouting, Laughing, Mocking, Flouting, Quaffing, One and all; All have had a belly-full Of breakfast brave and plentifull; Therefore Evermore With your Voices and your Bodies Serve the Goddess, And Raise Songs of Praise; She shall save the Country still, And save it against the traitors will; âSo she Says. Semichorus. Now let us raise, in a different strain, The praise of the Goddess The author here marks the different character of the worship of Ceres, as compared with that of Bacchus. the Giver of Grain; Imploring her favour With other behaviour, In measures more sober, submissive, and graver. Semichorus. Ceres, holy Patroness, Condescend to mark and bless With benevolent regard, Both the Chorus and the Bard; Grant them for the present day Many things to sing and say. Follies intermixt with sense; Folly, but without offence. Grant them with the present play To bear the prize of verse away. Semichorus. Now call again, and with a different measure, The Pow'r of Mirth and Pleasure; The florid, active Bacchus, bright and gay, To journey forth and join us on the way. Semichorus. O Bacchus, attend! the customary Patron Of every lively lay; Go forth without delay Thy Wonted annual Way, To meet the Ceremonious Holy Matron: Ceres. Her grave procession gracing, Thine airy footsteps tracing With unlaborious, light, celestial motion; And here at thy devotion Behold thy faithful Quire In pitiful attire; All overworn and ragged, This jerkin old and jagged, These buskins torn and burst, Though sufferers in the fray, May serve us at the worst To sport throughout the day; And there within the shades, I spy some lovely Maids; With whom we romp'd and revell'd, Dismantled and dishevell'd; With their bosoms open, With whom we might be coping. Xanthias. Well, I was always hearty Dispos'd to mirth and ease, I'm ready to join the party. Bacchus. And I will, if you please. B. With a tone of imbecility, like Sir Andrew Aguecheek's âyes, and I tooâââAye or I either.â [Some verses follow, which are sung by the Chorus, and in which some of the characters of the State are lampooned; they are not capable of translation, but are introduced appropriately, as the Bacchic and Eleusinian processions, which are here represented, were accompanied by a great license of abuse and ribaldry.] Bacchus [to the Chorus.] Prithy, my good Fellows, Would you please to tell us Which is Pluto's door, I'm an utter stranger, Never here before. Chorus. Friend, you're out of danger, You need not seek it far; There it stands before ye, Before ye, where you are. B. Take Ã¹p your bÃ¹ndles, XÃ nthias. X. HÃ ng all bÃ¹ndles; A bÃ¹ndle hÃ s no Ã¨nd, and ThÃ¨se have nÃ²ne. [Exeunt Bacchus and Xanthias. Semichorus. Now we go to dance and sing In the consecrated shades; Round the secret holy Ring, With the Matrons and the Maids. Thither I must haste to bring The mysterious early Light; Which must witness every Rite Of the joyous happy night. Semichorus. Let us hastenâLet us Flyâ Where the lovely meadows lie; Where the living Waters flow; Where the Roses bloom and blow. âHeirs of Immortality, Segregated, safe, and pure, Easy, sorrowless, secure; Since our earthly Course is run, We behold a brighter sun Holy Livesâa Holy Vowâ Such rewards awaits them now. Scene. The Gate of Pluto's Palace. Enter Bacchus and Xanthias. B. [going up to the door with considerable hesitation.] Compare this with Bacchus's behaviour at Hercules's door where he knew he was quite safe. Well, hÃ²w must I knÃ²ck at the DoÃ²r now? CÃ n't you tÃ¨ll me? HÃ²w do the nÃ tive inhÃ bitants knÃ²ck at DoÃ²rs? X. Pah! DÃ²n't stand foÃ²ling there; but smÃ¬te it smÃ rtly, With the vÃ¨ry spÃ¬rit and aÃ¬r of HÃ¨rculÃ¨s. B. HollÃ²h!! Ãacus [from within, with the voice of a Royal and Infernal Porter.] Who's thÃ¨re? B. 'Tis, Ã, the vÃ liant HÃ¨rcules! B. with a forced voice. Ã. [coming out.] The Scholiast informs us, that the horrific part of Ãacus's Speech is an imitation of an attempt at the sublime, in Euripides's Tragedy of Theseus, which is now lost; but which probably related to his descent to the infernal Regions. The whole of the speech in the original is worth examining; it seems intended as a sportive display of poetical execution; passing, by short imperceptible gradations, through the whole Scale of Style, from the anger of Comedy, to the loftiest and most exaggerated style of Tragedy, till it is blown up into bombast, and finishes in burlesque. Thou brÃ¹tal, abÃ²minable, detÃ¨stable, Vile, vÃ¬llainous, infamous, nefÃ rious, scÃ²undrel! âHow dÃ¹rst thou, vÃ¬llain as thou wÃ¨rt, to sÃ¨ize Our wÃ tch-dog, CÃ¨rberus, whom I kÃ¨pt and tÃ¨nded.

[Ãacus departs with a tremendous tragical exit, and Bacchus falls to the ground in a fright. X. HollÃ²h, you! WhÃ t's the mÃ tter thÃ¨reâ? B. Oh deÃ r I've hÃ d an Ã ccidÃ¨nt. X. Poh!

Bacchus, now his mind is at ease, begins to be humorous. Hercules had a temple at the village of Melite; but a sarcasm is implied against Callias, who was likewise of Melite, and used a Lion-skin as his military dress. X.

Dexterous and wily wits, Find their own advantage ever; For the wind where'er it sits, Leaves a berth secure and clever To the ready navigator; That foresees and knows the nature Of the wind and weather's drift; And betimes can turn and shift To the shelter'd easy side; 'Tis a practice prov'd and tried, Not to wear a formal face; Fixt in attitude and place, Like an image on its base; 'Tis the custom of seas, Which, as all the world agrees, Justifies Theramenes. The political versatility of Theramenes is noticed in a subsequent passage in the altercation between Ãschylus and Euripides. The naval allusion may be supposed to refer to his conduct towards his colleagues in command, after the battle of ArginusÃ¦. Bacchus. How ridiculous and strange; What a monstrous proposition, That I should condescend to change My dress, my name, and my condition, To follow Xanthias, and behave Like a mortal and a slave; To be set to watch the door, While he wallow'd with his whore, Tumbling on a purple bed; While I waited with submission, To receive a broken head; Or be kick'd upon suspicion, Of impertinence and peeping At the joys that he was reaping. [As Bacchus was before made answerable for the offence which Hercules had committed in seizing Cerberus, he is now accused of other misdemeanours which Hercules (agreeably to the character of voracity and violence which was attributed to him by the Comic Writers) might be supposed to have committed in the course of the same expedition.] Enter Two Women, Sutlers or Keepers of an Eating House. 1 Woman.

Chorus [addressing Xanthias.] Now that you revive and flourish In your old attire again, You must rouse afresh and nourish Thoughts of an heroic strain; That exalt and raise the figure, And assume a fire and vigour; And an attitude and air, Suited to the garb you wear; With a brow severely bent, Like the god you represent. But beware, Have a care! If you blunder, or betray Any weakness any way; Weakness of the heart or brain, We shall see you once again, Trudging in the former track, With the bundles at your back. Xanthias (in reply to the Chorus.) Friends, I thank you for your care; Your advice was good and fair; Corresponding in its tone With reflections of my ownâ âThough I clearly comprehend All the upshot and the end. (That if any good comes of it, Any pleasure any profitâ He, my master, will recede From the terms that were agreed) You shall see me, notwithstanding, Stern, intrepid, and commanding. Now's the time?âFor there's a noise! Now for figure, look, and voice! Ãacus enters again as a vulgar executioner of the Law, with suitable understrappers in attendance. [Ãacus is exhibited, in the following scene, as the ideal character of a perfect and accomplished Bailiff and Thieftaker, and is marked by traits which prove that the genus has remained unchanged in the 2000 years between the times of Aristophanes and Fielding.âThe true hardness of mind is most strikingly apparent in those passages where he means to be civil and accommodating. Thus Foote has characterised his Miser by traits of miserly liberality. The unfeeling master is personated by a slave (as the unfeeling Courtier is by Autolycus in the Winter's Tale); the scene is thus removed one degree further from reality, otherwise like the Tartuffe it would excite too strong a feeling of indignation, and outstep the true limits of Comedy.

Ãcus perseveres and applies his discipline alternately to Bacchus and Xanthias, and extorts from them various involuntary exclamations of pain, which they immediately account for, and justify in some ridiculous way. The passage cannot be translated literally, but an idea may be given of it. Suppose Bacchus to receive a blow, he exclaims Oh Dear!! [and immediately subjoins] Companions of my youthful years. X. [to Ãacus.] Did ye hear? he made an outcry. Ã. What was that? B. A favourite passage from Archilochus. Xanthias receives a blow, and exclaims Oh Jupiter!! and subjoins, that on the Idean height; and contends that he has been repeating the first line of a well known Hymn.

I only wÃ¬sh It had hÃ ppen'd to occÃ¹r befÃ²re you beÃ t us. The changes of character between Bacchus and Xanthias in the preceding scenes, have obviously no reference to the improvement or decline of the dramatic art, which is the main ostensible object of the Comedy; but if we look to the critical and dangerous situation of the state at the period when it was produced (viz. the 3d year of the 93d Olympiad) and attend to the unusually vehement and earnest political remonstrances in the address of the Chorus to the Audience which follows in the next page, we shall see abundant reason to conclude that some part of the action of the stage must have been intended to be understood in a political sense. The measure which at that time was uppermost in the minds of every body, but which nobody would venture openly to propose, was the recal of Alcibiades from his second banishment; a subject which is brought forward in the last scene but one, and upon which Ãschylus and Euripides are made to deliver their opinions. The intention of the Author being evidently in favour of Alcibiades, as he makes the favourable opinion proceed from the worthier and more manly character. It should appear that in the preceding scenes in the Infernal Regions, Xanthias is the representative of Alcibiades, and Bacchus of the Athenian people; and that the changes of character represent the changes in their political relation to each other. The scene in which they are made to contend as to their ability to bear a beating without crying out, is merely a proverb dramatized and put into action like those of the French, who have made a part of the amusement to consist in guessing the proverb. The solution of the enigma in this case would be ??????? ?????????? ?????, which was applied to people who, to their mutual injury, persevered in refusing to be reconciled. Such was at the time this play was produced the relative situation of Alcibiades and of the Athenian people; he was living in exile upon his own estate in Thrace, while they were struggling with difficulties from which his genius and abilities might have relieved them; the blows of fortune fell equally upon them both, and the question as to which was the greater sufferer, might be deemed as difficult of decision as it appeared to Ãacus, who, after all the discipline impartially inflicted on the contending parties, was obliged to leave it undetermined. The original and admirable speculation of Mr. Whiter upon the doctrine of the association of ideas considered as an instrument of criticism, is applicable to much higher purposes, but since it falls in our way, we may venture to employ it here. The recal of Alcibiades was considered as a measure which must place him at once at the head of the government, and be accompanied with a considerable retrenchment of the powers of the Democracy; on the other hand it was expected by those who were favourable to the measure, that under his conduct and management of the affairs of the Republic might be retrieved, and its ancient ascendancy reassertedâthat the result would be success abroad and a Government at home partly Democratic and partly Dictatorial. Now if we were right in conjecturing that the proverb abovementioned was alluded to in the foregoing scene, we shall see that it was connected in Aristophanes's mind with those very ideas of subsequent reconciliation, joint command, and external ascendancy: ???????????? ??????? ??????????? ?????? ???? ???????????? ????? ??? ??????? ??????. I do not know whether it is worth while to mention some coincidences which may be casual. The pole with which Xanthias appears, and which seems to be the emblem of his situation, and which Bacchus calls ????????, had another name, as we learn from the argument (viz. ????????), which would make it a proper emblem of the representative of Alcibiades. Xanthias is in the first instance degraded in consequence of being invited to a banquet by Proserpine. Alcibiades's first exile was connected with a charge against him of having profaned the mysteries of Ceres and Proserpine at a banquet. The ludicrous song in which Bacchus justifies himself for having degraded Xanthias, is a fair burlesque representation of the mixture of envy and indignation which the undisguised ascendancy and the insolent debauches of Alcibiades had excited in the minds of the Athenian people, and which contributed powerfully to produce his first banishment. The continuator of Brumoy seems to have been aware of the propriety of looking for some political interpretation of these scenes; he supposes Xanthias to be a personification of the newly enfranchised slaves; but Aristophanes, as we see from the address of the Chorus in the next page, approved of the measure, and certainly could not mean to hold out to the new Citizens the possibility of their being again reduced to servitude. As Aristophanes's humour frequently carries double, this explanation might perhaps hold good as far as Xanthias's first investiture with the Lion's skin, but is wholly inapplicable to the subsequent changes. The passages which follow, may be considered as a relic and sample of the Primitive Satyric Comedy, which (as it is well known) consisted solely of Songs and Recitations, unaccompanied by Dramatic action or dialogue. We may venture to imagine that a gradual change, in the form and conduct of Comedy, might have taken place, nearly in this manner. Let it be supposed, that, in process of time, some species of exhibition in dumb shew, was introduced, to illustrate and relieve the continued series of singing and recitation which constituted the Primitive Satyric Comedyâwe may conceive, that these Pantomimic Actors, would by degrees be emancipated from the obligation of silence, and we shall then see, that upon the ground of this emancipation, the Aristophanic, or Antient Comedy (as we may be allowed to call it, in contradistinction to the Primitive) might have been originally founded. When once the Pantomimic Actors, had by dint of gradual and permitted encroachment, established themselves in the indisputed privilege of speech, the antient or Aristophanic Comedy would in fact have received its existence, not as a declared innovation, but as an allowable improvement of the lawful primitive Comedy such as it had existed in the preceding period, during which the Satyric recital had been illustrated by interludes in dumb shew. But as the change, though in fact a most essential one, was neither acknowledged nor avowed, it would not (in the first instance at least) occasion any alteration of the established forms of the primitive Comedy, or the omission of any of the various kinds of recited compositions, which had formed the sum total of the original entertainment. It would seem even reasonable a priori, to conclude, that they would be retained and accommodated to the action, and to the dialogue then for the first time introduced: And that they were so retained; more strictly perhaps in the first instance, (and in the earliest attempts of each successive Poet of the Antient Comedy, before an established reputation enabled him to depart from the strict observation of theatric etiquette) and, in process of time, less punctually, and with a greater degree of latitude, both by individuals, and by the whole school of Antient Comedy; will I think appear probable, to those whose recollection will furnish them with immediate instances from the Comedies of Aristophanes; or who with these and some farther suggestions presented to them, may think it worth while to examine them. The Epirrema and Antepirrema being in almost every instance totally unconnected with the action of the play; being addressed moreover to the Audience, by the Chorus remaining alone in possession of the stage, during a suspension of the dramatic action; and frequently (as in the instance immediately following) conveying important political suggestions or strong reflections upon the vices and abuses of the times; may perhaps, upon a consideration of all these circumstances; be recognized without scruple, as a remnant of the recited Satyric effusions of the primitive Comedy. It is observable, that the Epirrema and Antepirrema are occasionally repeated more than once in the same Play; a circumstance which ought not to be overlooked, in any attempt which may be made to form an idea of the primitive Satyric Comedy, by reconstructing it from the vestiges which are discoverable in the Aristophanic Comedy. The Parabasis, which was likewise recited by the Chorus alone and unaccompanied by the dramatic performers, will naturally be referred to the same origin. It seems to have been frequently omitted in Aristophanic Comedy; and is generally introduced with some apology on the part of the Chorus, for obtruding themselves on the attention of the audience; and for detaining them with (the common topic of a Parabasis) an encomium or vindication of the Author. In the present play it is omitted, unless the semi-chorus, p. 23. âKeep silence, &amp;c.â should be considered a very diminutive and imperfect specimen. We have then, the Parabasis together with the Epirrema and Antepirrema; the two last (as was before observed) repeated more than once; and these, (as we have seen), were recited by the Chorus remaining in exclusive possession of the Stageâthese therefore, as far as they go, may serve to give us an idea of the Primitive Comedy: but in order to furnish an entertainment of any tolerable length; it will be necessary to detect other portions of it, which having been accommodated to, and incorporated with, the Dramatic action, appear at present in a form which renders it less easy to recognize and reclaim them. Among these I should venture to place the ????? ????? or long Satyric narrative in Iambics; considering that, narrative, either real or fictitious, is the most obvious of all the forms of Satyric composition; I cannot but imagine that it must have existed, even in the most early forms of Satyric Comedy; though not always retained in the Plays of Aristophanes, it seems whenever it was admitted, to have been considered as a regular feature of the Play, and a subject for separate criticism or commendation. In the two earliest Plays of Aristophanes (in which he may be supposed to have adhered most scrupulously to the established formalities of the Theatre) the ????? or narrative, occupies a very distinguished place, and is addressed to the Chorus by a single actor who is (be it observed) alone in possession of the Stage. All these circumstances, together with the existence of the long ?????, or narrative in the Tragic Dramas, as a piece of composition much laboured and attended to; seem to point to the same conclusion, and to indicate that the origin of these compositions is derived from the earliest institutions of Tragedy and Comedy, and from the primitive form of each of them, anterior to the introduction of Dramatic Dialogue: I say Dramatic Dialogue; for a form of Dialogue not properly dramatic, seems to have existed in the Primitive Comedy, and to have maintained its place in the antient or Aristophanic Comedy, in which it is still discernible. The two long argumentative dialogues, the one in Tetrameter Iambics, in which the advantage is given to the meaner character and the baser opinion; and the other in AnapÃ¦ests, in which the superior character is represented See for instance, the two dialogues between Ãschylus and Euripides which follow p. 55 and 58. as asserting a higher principle; these two Dialogues, occurring in almost all the Plays of Aristophanes, are indeed usually connected with the dramatic action, but they do not tend in any degree to advance it; not at least in any degree proportionate to the space which they occupy, or to the attention which appears to have been In the present instance it is not unhappily connected with the action of the Playâbut it is in fact, a mere controversy as to the comparative merits of the earlier and later school of Tragic Poetry. bestowed upon themâthey serve merely to exhibit a sharp encounter of wits upon a given controversial topic; and, if detached from the Play, might be fairly considered a mere satyric dialogue. If, therefore, we separate from the Aristophanic Comedy, the two forms of satyric dialogue above mentioned, together with the ????? ?????, (or long satyric narrative) the Parabasis, (or address of the Chorus to the Audience on behalf of the Author) and finally the epirrema and antepirrema, (repeated, as was before observed, sometimes more than once in the course of the same piece) and if we add to these a number of satyrical songs and lampoons; we shall be able to form to ourselves, an idea not wholly inadequate, of the form and nature of the primitive Satyric Comedy unaccompanied by Dramatic action; if, again, we suppose (as was before suggested) that this series of Songs, and Recitations, and Satyric Dialogue, and narrative was relieved at intervals by a pantomimic representation in dumb shew; we shall have arrived upon the very confines of the Aristophanic Comedy; where, in order to pass the boundary, nothing would be wanting, but to remove the barrier which restrained the pantomimic Actor from the privilege of speech. It may be worth while to point out a singular coincidence arising out of the suppositions before mentioned. The number of the Actors, by which each Comedy was performed, was by law and custom limited to three; this law or custom might have been occasionally transgressed; but the regulation which excluded a fourth Actor, was generally adhered to as conformable to authority and precedent; which, in matters of religious institution (for such these Comedies were considered, being a portion of the ceremonies connected with the Bacchic worship) were not to be rashly or unnecessarily violated. Now, if we suppose this precedent to have originated from the practice of the Primitive Comedy; and assume at the same time, the suppositions respecting its form and substance, which have been before stated; we shall see, that in addition to the Chorus, it admitted of three Actors, who were entitled to the privilege of speechânamely, the reciter of the long ?????, or satyric narrative; and the two disputants in the controversial dialogues. As it would be difficult to account for this restriction from the general principles of Dramatic art; we must, I apprehend, be content to attribute it to a precedent derived from the most antient practice of the Primitive Comedy: it seems that the excessive number of Actors had grown into what was considered to be an abuse; but when abuses are to be reformed, the regulations which restrain them are generally established upon the authority of the earliest examples; which (as we have seen) would not have admitted of more than three Actors, in addition to the Chorus. We have, therefore, as remnants of the Primitive Satyric Comedy, independent of Dramatic or Pantomimic actionâ The Parabasis, The Satyric Songs and Lampoons, The Epirrema and Antepirrema, The Long narrative, The Dialogue in Tetrameter Iambics, Another, on the same Subject, in AnapÃ¦sts, The Epirrema and Antepirrema repeated, Finally, a Conclusion, probably not much unlike that of the Acharnians, or the Peace, the tone of which seems borrowed from a more primitive jovial rustic style. After the introduction of Pantomime, a second Narrative seems to have been introduced, explanatory and prefatory to the action which was to follow. This, too, appears to have preserved its place in the Aristophanic Comedy, and is to be found in most of the Plays; as Knights, l 40: Wasps, l 85: Peace, l 50, in all of which (it is to be observed) it is addrest by the speaker directly to the Audience. The vehemence of the remonstrance conveyed in the following composition, has been already noticed (p. 39.) For the state of things which gave rise to it, the Reader must again be referred to a description of the critical and disgraceful condition of Athens at that period (the 3d year of the 93d Olympiad) Mr. Mitford has described it with his usual force and accuracy. It is observable that in most of the Plays of Aristophanes, there appears a sort of falling off in the Antepirrema, as if the poet were, or affected to be, apprehensive of having ventured too far in the preceding Epirrema. In this instance, the same warmth and energy is sustained throughout, but still with a slight distinction of character between the two. In the Epirrema, the Chorus begin gravely and authoritatively. In the Antepirrema, they resume the same subject, with a fanciful comparison. The Epirrema and Antepirrema are (here, as elsewhere) preceded by a short personal lampoon, which has no obvious connection with the action of the Drama; a circumstance which, in addition to others already indicated, serves to mark the connection, between the Primitive and the Aristophanic Comedy. Chorus. Muse attend our solemn summons, And survey the assembled commons Congregated as they sit, An enormous mass of wit, âFull of genius, taste, and fire, Jealous pride, and critic ireâ Cleophon among the rest, Cleophon one of the chief demagogues in the then ruined and degraded democracy. His mother was a Thracian, and Plato (the comic writer) had introduced her speaking in a broken jargon. He was put to death in a popular tumult. (Like the swallow from her nest A familiar foreign bird,) Chatters loud and will be heard, (With the accent and the grace Which he brought with him from Thrace) But we fear the tuneful strain, Will be turn'd to grief and pain; He must sing a dirge perforce When his trial takes its course; We shall hear him moan and wail, Like the plaintive nightingale. EPIRREMA. Metre long Trochaics âAs near Porto Bello.â It behoves the sacred Chorus, and of right to them belongs, To suggest the best advice in their addresses and their songs. In performance of our office, we present with all humility A proposal for removing groundless fears and disability, First that all that were inveigled into Phrynichus's treason, Phrynicus. See Mr. Mitford, ch. 19, Sect. 5 and 7. Should be suffer'd and receiv'd by rules of evidence and reason To clear their conductâSecondly, that none of our Athenian race, Should live suspected and subjected, to loss of franchise and disgrace, Feeling it a grievous scandal when a single naval fight, Renders foreigners and slaves partakers of the City's right: âNot that we condemn the measure; we conceiv'd it wisely done, As a just and timely measure and the first and only one: âBut your kinsmen and your comrades, those with whom you fought and bore Danger, hardship, and fatigue, or with their fathers long before Struggling on the land and ocean labouring with the spear and oar âThese we think as they profess repentance for their past behaviour, Might by your exalted wisdoms, be receiv'd to grace and favour. Better it would be, believe us, casting off revenge and pride, To receive as friends and kinsmen, all that combat on our side Into full and equal franchise: on the other hand we fear If your hearts are filled with fancies, haughty, captious, and severe; While the shock of instant danger threatens shipwreck to the state, Such resolves will be lamented and repented of too late. [Chorus.] If the Muse foresees at all What in future will befall Dirty Cleigenes the smallâ He the sovereign of the bathâ Will not long escape from scath: But must perish by and by, With his potash and his lye; With his realm and dynasty His terraqueous scouring ball And his washes one and all; Therefore he can never cease To declaim against a peace. Parody from a tragic Chorus predicting the downfall of some reigning family. Cleigenes one of the obscure demagogues of the time, not mentioned by the scholiast. ANTEPIRREMA. Often times have we reflected on a similar abuse In the choice of men for office, and of coins for common use; In the exhaustion of their resources, the Athenians had recourse to a debased currencyâof course the good coin disappeared. For your old and standard pieces, valued, and approved, and tried, Here among the Grecian nations, and in all the world beside; Recogniz'd in every Realm, for trusty stamp and pure assay, Are rejected and abandon'd for the trash of yesterday; For a vile adulterate issue, drossy counterfeit and base, Which the traffic of the City passes current in their place! And the men that stood for office noted for acknowledg'd worth, And for manly deeds of honour, and for honourable birth; Train'd in exercise and art, in sacred dances and in song, All are ousted and supplanted by a base ignoble throng; Paltry stamp and vulgar mettle raise them to command and place Brazen counterfeit pretenders, scoundrels of a scoundrel race; Whom the state in former ages scarce would have allow'd to stand At the sacrifice of outcasts, as the Scape-goats of the land. The human Scape-goat, the last unbloody remnant of human sacrifice. âTime it isâand long has been renouncing all your follies past To recur to sterling merit and intrinsic worth at last. âIf we rise with honour; if we fall, it must be so! âBut there was an ancient saying, which we all have heard and know. That the wise in dangerous cases have esteem'd it safe and good, To receive a slight chastisement from a Wand of noble wood. The original Proverb says âIt is best to be hanged on a good Tree.â For the English Proverb see the foot of the page. The measure suggested is the recall of Alcibiades, whose ascendancy would be less disgraceful than that of its existing rulers. A Bludgeon stands for death and blood, But a Wand of worthy wood Chastises children for their good. Scene Xanthias and Ãacus. When two persons, perfectly strangers, are thrown together, in a situation which makes it advisable for them to commence an immediate intimacy, they commonly begin by discovering a marvellous coincidence of taste and judgment upon all current topics. This observation, which is not wholly superfluous here, appears to have been so far trite and hacknied in the time of Aristophanes, as to allow of its being exemplified in a piece of very brief burlesque. Xanthias and Ãacus are the strangers; they discover immediately an uniformity of feeling and sentiment upon the topics most familiar to them as slaves; and conclude by a sudden pledge of friendship. It is to be observed that, in the dialogue which follows; Ãacus never departs from the high ground of superiority in point of local information. All his answers have a slight tinge of irony, as if he was sayingââYesâmuch you know about it!â Ãac. By JÃ¹piter! but HÃ¨'s a gÃ¨ntlemÃ n. That MÃ ster of yours. X. A GÃ¨ntlemÃ n!

The full-mouth'd master of the Tragic quire, We shall behold him foam with rage and ire; âConfronting in the list His eager, shrewd, sharp-tooth'd antagonist. Then will his visual orbs be wildly whirl'd And huge invectives will be hurl'd. Superb and supercilious, Atrocious, atrabilious, With furious gesture and with lips of foam, And lion crest unconscious of the comb; Erect with rage,âhis brow's impending gloom, O'ershadowing his dark eyes' terrific blaze. The opponent, dexterous and wary, Will fend and parry: While masses of conglomerated phrase, Enormous, ponderous, and pedantic, With indignation frantic, And strength and force gigantic, Are desperately sped At his devoted headâ Then in different style The touchstone and the file, And subtleties of art In turn will play their part; Analysis and rule And every modern tool; With critic scratch and scribble, And nice invidious nibble; Contending for the important choice, A vast expenditure of human voice!

Euripides' mother was of a very low caste. See v. 1181. A rÃ¹de unbrÃ¬dled tÃ²ngue, a haÃ¹ghty spÃ¬rit; Proud, Ã rrogant, and Ã¬nsolently pÃ²mpous; Rough, clÃ²wnish, boÃ¬sterous, and Ã²verbeÃ ring.

A sÃ crifice tÃ² the wÃ¬ndsâMake rÃ¨ady; The storm of rage is gathering. Bring a victim. Bacchus does not call for a sacrifice. It is his buffoonish way of saying that Ãschylus is going to be in a stormy passion.

Aiming shrewd satyric darts At his Rival's noble parts; And with sallies sharp and keen, Try to wound him in the spleen; While the Veteran rends and raises, Rifted, rough, uprooted phrases, Wielded like a threshing staff, Scattering the dust and chaff. The metre which follows is so essentially vulgar, that I am not able to recollect any line of it in English which is fit to be quoted. B.

Yes by Joveâand at their homes General distress had produced a stricter economy, which is here humourously attributed to the precepts of Euripides.

Well I laughed till I cried The last festival tide, At the fellow that ran, T'was a heavy fat man, And he panted and hobbled, And stumbled and wabbled, And the pottery people about the Gate, Seeing him hurried, and tir'd, and late, Stood to receive him in open rank, Helping him on with a hearty spank Over the shoulder, and over the flank, The flank, the loin, the back, the shoulders, With shouts of applause from all beholders; While he ran on with a filthy fright, Puffing his link to keep it alight. If the Table of Contents assigned to the primitive Comedy in page 44, should be thought too scanty, we may venture to add to it all those regular debates, which are managed by two disputants acting alternately as Opponent and Respondent, in which the Chorus appears as the Moderator and generally (though in the present instance that office is assigned to Bacchus) as the Judge of the controversy, the arguments on both sides, the attack, and the reply, being regularly preceded by a short exhortation from the Chorus. Formal disputation of this kind would be wholly out of place in Comedy (such as we generally conceive it, namely, a Comedy consisting of dramatic action) accordingly, no instance of the kind is to be found, I believe, in modern Comedy or in, what was called, the new Comedy of the Greeks, the remains of which have been preserved to us in the translations of Plautus and Terence. It should seem therefore that the frequent recurrence of these sort of disputations in the Comedies of Aristophanes can hardly be accounted for in any way more probably, than by supposing them to have existed in the primitive Comedy, that undramatic form, from which the antient (as it is called) or Aristophanic form was immediately derived. We may venture therefore to enumerate, among the constituent parts of the primitive undramatic Comedy, controversies upon debated points or upon a comparison of their own respective merits, in which two disputants were engaged with the Chorus presiding as judge and moderator. If this inference is not strictly logical, it may at least be allowed to be geological. The primary stratum of primitive Comedy is lostâbut a conjecture may be formed as to its composition by observing those substances, which, though they abound in the strata of transition, are no longer discoverable in those of more recent formation. We conclude that such substances must have formed a component part of that elder stratum which has disappeared. In the case now before us the stratum of transition is the antient or Aristophanic Comedy forming a connecting link between the primitive undramatic Comedy and the new Comedy, of the Greeks, (the Comedy of Menander and Terence) the character of which is exclusively dramatic and in no respect different from that of modern Comedy. In this view of the subject the middle Comedy (as it was called by the Critics of antiquity) is not taken into account; it was in fact merely a mutilated form of the Aristophanic Comedy stripped of its chorus, of its personalities, and of its privileges of political satireâit is identified with the antient or Aristophanic Comedy by its main characteristic, the utter impossibility of the story; and upon this ground stands (equally with the antient Comedy) in direct contrast with the new Comedy in which (as in modern Comedy) an adherence to the probabilities of real life is an essential requisite. The antient Comedy, amidst its infinite variety of supernatural and incredible subjects, admitted burlesque representations of mythological and heroic traditions, and among the titles of his Comedies that are lost, the DÃ¦dalus, the Danaids, the Lemnian Women, (or the story of Jason and Hypsipyle) prove that Aristophanes, even before the suppression of the genuine antient Comedy, did not neglect subjects of this kind. Cratinus too, who died long before that period, among the scanty fragments that remain of him, has still left in existence a single line from a Comedy representing Ulysses in the Cave of the Cyclops. But subjects of this kind formed the main resource of the writers of the middle Comedy, and their productions of this description were much more numerous. Therefore, as the result of this digression, it may be allowable to observe, if nobody should have observed it before, that (in additon to the Plutus of Aristophanes) the Amphitryon of Plautus (undoubtedly translated from Greek) may be regarded as a specimen of the middle Comedy of the Greeks; and this result, however interesting, being not much to the purpose of the present translation, we will proceed forthwith to the lines in which the Chorus perform their part in animating and encouraging the disputants. Chorus E'er the prize is lost and won An allusion to the combats of the Pancratium, in which all means of attack and defence were employed, as they are by the rival poets in the scenes which follow. Mighty doings will be done. Now thenâ(though to judge aright Is difficult, when force and might Are oppos'd with ready slight, When the Champion that is cast Tumbles uppermost at last) âSince you meet in equal match, Argue, contradict and scratch, Scuffle, and abuse and bite, Tear and fight, With all your wits and all your might. âFear not for a want of sense Or judgement in your audience, That defect has been remov'd; Here is a little coaxing to the audience but also a little irony. I suspect that Aristophanes was no great friend to reading and writing as compared with the antient system of memory and recitation. They're prodigiously improv'd, Disciplin'd, alert and smart, Drill'd and exercis'd in art: Each has got a little book, In the which they read and look, Doing all their best endeavour To be critical and clever; Thus their own ingenious natures, Aided and improv'd by learning, Will provide you with spectators Shrewd, attentive, and discerning. The altercation which follows, turning upon a question of verbal criticism, is incapable of an exact translation. The attack with its answer occupy about 45 lines in the original; Euripides begins it, saying that his opponent is incorrect in his use of words, and offers to prove it from those parts of his Tragedies which were usually the most carefully composed, (the opening Speeches or Prologues as they were called).â He then calls upon Ãschylus to repeat the first lines from the Tragedy of Orestes; in this Tragedy Orestes is represented as having returned secretly to Argos, standing at the tomb of his father, and invoking Mercury, (not the vulgar patron of thieves and pedlars, and spies) but that more awful Deity, the terrestrial Hermes, the guardian of the dead, and inspector general of the Infernal Regions, the care of which had been delegated to him by the paternal authority of Jupiter. The obscurity and ambiguity of the original may be represented by the following lines, Terrestrial Hermes with supreme espial Inspector of that old paternal Realm, Aid and assist me now your Suppliant Revisiting and returning to my country! This is variously misinterpreted. The espial is supposed to refer to the treason practised against Agamemnon,âthe paternal realm to be that of Argos; and the last line is objected to as containing a tautology;âÃschylus defends himself by the explanation of his meaning which has been already given, and in answer to the last objection contends that for an exile to revisit his country and to return to it is not the same thing: to which Euripides replies, It Ã¬s not jÃ¹stly exprÃ¨ss'd, since he retÃ¹rn'd ClandÃ¨stinely withoÃ¹t authÃ²rity.

Ãschylus then attacks Euripides for the monotony of his metre, and the continued recurrence of a pause on the fifth syllable, which he ridicules by a burlesque addition subjoined to all the verses in which this cadence is detected. The point and humour of this supplementary phrase is not explained to us by the antient Scholiasts, nor has the industry of modern commentators enabled them to detect it. Euripides repeats the first lines of several of his Tragedies, but falls perpetually upon the same pause, and is met at every turn with the absurd supplement, till Bacchus calls out to him, ThÃ¨re! that's enÃ²ughânow cÃ²me to his mÃ¹sic, cÃ n't ye? Eu. I mÃ¨an it; I shall nÃ²w procÃ¨ed to expÃ²se him As a bÃ d compÃ²ser, Ã wkard, uninvÃ¨ntive, RepÃ¨ating the same strÃ in perpÃ¨tuallyâ Chorus.

Of the part of the entertainment which followed, however amusing it might have been to the musical critics of Athens, it is impossible for a modern to form any satisfactory notion. It consisted of a musical burlesque, in which each of the rival candidates (Euripides and Ãschylus) is represented as exhibiting a caricature of the style of his opponent. This caricature seems to have consisted of a series of musical phrases selected from their works, but (as the music was the only object, while the words served only to indicate the music which was attached to them), the words which now remain alone (the music having shared the common fate of all the other music of the antients) present little more than a jumble of sentences incapable of being connected by any continuous meaning. We have seen that Ãschylus is accused of repeating the same strain perpetuallyâthis, it should seem, was exemplified by bringing together passages from the Chorusses of different Plays, which were marked by the recurrence of the same musical phrase. The Scholiasts point out passages from the Chorusses of four Plays, which are thus brought into juxtaposition; but the main subject of burlesque appears to have been a Chorus from the Tragedy of the Myrmidons (the soldiers of Achilles) in which they were represented as addressing their Chief after the death of Patroclus and the discomfiture of the Greeks. We may easily suppose that the peculiarities of Ãschylus's stile would be most strongly exemplified in a Chorus composed of such characters. It might have been deemed allowable, and perhaps advisable (after the explanation already given) to relinquish any attempt at representing what is so little capable of being represented; but as nature in general, and the nature of translation more particularly, abhors a vacuum, a few lines are put together in an Ãschylean metre, which may serve as a substitute to fill up the chasm, and to represent the Chorus (that of the Myrmidons) which was the chief subject of this burlesque criticism. It must be left to the musical Reader, if the Reader should happen to be musical, to imagine to himself a noisy boisterous accompaniment on a wind instrument. Though perhaps his imagination might be more amusingly employed in conceiving a similar scene of contest between the great musical favorites of the last and the present Century, between Gluck or Handel for instance, and Rossini.

With the dawn I was beginning Spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning, Unconscious of the meditated crime; Meaning to sell my yarn at market-time.

If we mistrust where present trust is plac'd, Trusting in what was heretofore mistrustedâ Under cover of ridiculing Euripides's style, harsh and obscure where it aspires to be sententious, and prosaic where it is meant to be familiar; Aristophanes contrives to impress and to repeat twice the same sentiment (his own, see p. 47. v. 907). In the Acharnians, a caricature of Euripides' harangues serves as a cover for very bold opinions. B. How! WhÃ t? I'm at a lÃ²ssâSpeÃ k it agÃ in Not qÃ¹ite so lÃ¨arnedlyâmore plÃ inly and sÃ¬mply. Eu. If we withdraw the confidence we plac'd In these our present statesmen, and transfer it To those whom we mistrusted heretofore, This seems I think our fairest chance for safety: If with our present counsellors we fail, Then with their opposites we might succeed.

A double allusion to the pay of the juries which drained the Treasury, and to the hurry of the comedians, poets, actors, and judges, to go to the supper which concluded the business of the day, see Eccl. v. 1178.

A line in the Hippolytus which had given great offence, see p. 8. v. 112.-Here and in what follows Bacchus pays Euripides in his own philosophic coin vulgarized after his own (Bacchus's) fashion. The intention of the author has been made clearer by a little amplification. Eu. O wrÃ¨tch! whÃ t have you dÃ²ne? B. Me? dÃ²ne? What shoÃ¹ld I? VÃ²ted for Ãschylus to be sÃ¹reâWhy nÃ²t? Eu.

O crÃ¹el!âWÃ¬ll you abÃ ndon me to dÃ¨ath? B. Why perhÃ ps dÃ¨ath is lÃ¬fe, and life is dÃ¨ath, And vÃ¬ttles and drÃ¬nk an illusion of the sÃ¨nses; For what is Death but an eternal sleep? And does not Life consist in sleeping and eating? P. Now BÃ cchus, you'll cÃ²me hÃ¨re with us withÃ¬n. B. B. A little startled and alarmed. See Peisthetairus in the Birds, when he is invited to the mansion of the Hoopoe.What fÃ²r? P. To be receÃ¬v'd and Ã¨ntertaÃ¬n'd With a fÃ¨ast befÃ²re you gÃ². B. That's wÃ¨ll imÃ gin'd, With Ã ll my hÃ¨artâI've nÃ²t the leÃ st objÃ¨ction. Chorus. The style of the original seems to be taken from that of the moral and instructive verse intended for the improvement of children and young persons.Happy is the man possessing The superior holy blessing Of a judgement and a taste Accurate, refin'd and chaste; As it plainly doth appear In the scene presented here; Where the noble worthy Bard Meets with a deserv'd reward, Suffer'd to depart in peace Freely with a full release, To revisit once again His kindred and his countrymenâ Hence moreover You discover; It is curious to see Aristophanes' opinion as to the cause of the defects which he so frequently notices in Euripides; namely that they arose from an indolent philosophic curiosity, and the want of a true zeal for the perfection of his art. That to sit with Socrates, In a dream of learned ease; Quibbling, counter-quibbling, prating, Argufying and debating With the metaphysic sect, Daily sinking in neglect, Growing careless, incorrect, While the practice and the rules Of the true poetic Schools Are renounc'd or slighted wholly, Is a madness and a folly. Pluto. Go fÃ²rth with good wÃ¬shes and hÃ¨arty good-wÃ¬ll, And salÃ¹te the good pÃ¨ople on PÃ llas's hÃ¬ll; Let them hÃ¨ar and admÃ¬re father Ãschylus stÃ¬ll In his Ã²ffice of Ã²ld which agaÃ¬n he must fÃ¬ll: âYou must guÃ¬de and dirÃ¨ct them, InstrÃ¹ct and corrÃ¨ct them With a lÃ¨sson in vÃ¨rse, For you'll fÃ¬nd them much wÃ²rse; Greater fools than before, and their folly much more, And more numerous far than the blockheads of yoreâ See note, p. 45, other names of obscure demagogues occur in the original.âAnd give ClÃ¨ophon thÃ¬s, And bÃ¬d him not mÃ¬ss, But be sÃ¹re to attÃ¨nd To the sÃ¹mmons I sÃ¨nd: Nicomachus, see Mr. Mitford's History, Ch. 22, Sec. 1.To NicÃ²machus tÃ²o And the rÃ¨st of the crÃ¨w That devÃ¬se and invÃ¨nt New tÃ xes and trÃ¬bute Are sÃ¹mmons's sÃ¨nt Which you'll mÃ¬nd to distrÃ¬bute. Bid them cÃ²me to their grÃ ves, Or, like rÃ¹naway slaves If they lÃ¬nger and faÃ¬l, We shall drag them to jaÃ¬l; Down hÃ¨re in the dÃ rk With a brÃ nd and a mÃ rk. Ãsch. I shall dÃ² as you sÃ y; But the whÃ¬le I'm awÃ y, Let the sÃ¨at that I hÃ¨ld, Be by SÃ²phocles fÃ¬ll'd, As desÃ¨rvedly rÃ¨ckon'd My pÃ¹pil and sÃ¨cond In leÃ rning and mÃ¨rit And trÃ gical spÃ¬ritâ âAnd tÃ ke special cÃ re; Keep that rÃ¨probate thÃ¨re Far alÃ²of from the ChÃ ir; Let him nÃ¨ver sit Ã¬n it An hoÃ¹r or a mÃ¬nute, By chÃ nce or desÃ¬gn To profÃ ne what was mÃ¬ne. P. Bring fÃ²rward the TÃ²rches!âThe ChÃ²rus shall wÃ it And attÃ¨nd on the PÃ²et in TrÃ¬umph and StÃ te With a thÃ¹ndering chaÃ¹nt of majÃ¨stical tÃ²ne To wÃ¬sh him fÃ rewÃ¨ll, with a tÃ¹ne of his Ã²wn. [Hexameters.] In order to give English Hexameters a fair chance, it should be recollected that they are essentially a very slow and solemn measure, each line consisting of six bars, and each bar either of two crotchets, or of a crotchet and two quaversâwhereas, the English Heroic verse contains only two bars and a half, and in those instances in which the half bar is placed at the end, may be regarded as a truncated form of the scazon Iambic: the regular metrical Hexameter may consequently be considered, as somewhat longer, or slower at least in enunciation, than an entire Heroic couplet. The Reader may perhaps observe an irregularity in the second line, (what the Grammarians call an Anacrousisâi. e. unaccented syllables prefixed to the first ictus) this would be inadmissible in the regular Classical Hexameter, but the irregularity is so little offensive to the ear; that the writer in other attempts to construct English Hexameter has found himself in more than one instance unconsciously falling into is. He has therefore preferred to leave it as it stands, an instance of the liberty which may be deemed allowable in adapting to the English language this difficult, but by no means impracticable metre. Chorus. Now may the Powers of the Earth give a safe and speedy departure To the Bard at his second birth, with a prosperous happy revival; And may the City fatigued with wars and long revolution, At length be brought to return, to just and wise resolutions; Long in peace to remainâLet restless Cleophon hasten Far from amongst us hereâsince wars are his only diversion Thrace his native land will afford him wars in abundance.
