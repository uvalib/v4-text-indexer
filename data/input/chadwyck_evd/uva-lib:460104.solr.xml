      <field name="fulltext">THE BROTHERS;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Acted at the Funeral Games of L. Ãmilius Paulus, Sirnamed Macedonicus, because he had obtained a victory over Perseus king of Macedon; he died in the year of Rome 593, one hundred fifty-eight years before the nativity of Christ: he was so poor at the time of his decease, that they were constrained to sell his estate in order to pay his widow her dower. Dacier. Given by Q. Fabius Maximus, and P. Cornelius Africanus: In some copies we read, Q. F. M. &amp; P. C. A. Ãdilibus Curulibus.ââQ. Fabius Maximus, &amp; P. Cornelius Africanus, Curule Ãdiles.ââThis, as Scaliger, and other commentators are of opinion, must be erroneous: for the children and relations of the deceased, and not the Ãdiles, had always the direction of the funeral games. Besides, it is very certain, that P. C. Scipio Africanus, the son of Paulus Ãmilius, never was Ãdile, the Consulship having been conferred upon him the same year that he sued for the Ãdileship, though not yet arrived at the usual age assigned for that high dignity; as we are told by Aurelius Victor in his little Treatise of Illustrious Men. And this event did not happen till twelve years after the death of his father and the representation of this play, Scipio being even then but thirty-six years of age, before which time no person could be elected Ãdile.âMuret corrected the title after an ancient MS. he had seen at Venice. The Q. Fabius Maximus &amp; P. Cornelius Africanus here mentioned were the two sons of Ãmilius Paulus, and had taken the sirnames of the persons who had adopted them. This is undoubtedly the true reading. The Ãdiles that year were Q. Fulvius Nobilior &amp; L. Marcius. Dacier. Principal Actors, L. Attilius PrÃ¦nestinus, and Minutius Prothimus: The Musick, composed for Tyrian Flutes, Tibiis Sarranis. Tyre by the ancient PhÅnicians was called Sor; the Carthaginians, their descendants, called it Sar, from whence it came to be called Sarra. Sarranis therefore meant the same thing as Tyriis. These Tyrian flutes were the equal left-handed flutes, and always used upon joyful occasions.âAnd here arises a great difficulty, for how can we imagine that the children of Ãmilius would have allowed such musick at their father's funeral? It is impossible. This title is not only corrupt, but defective: the true reading is Acta primÃ¹m tibiis Lydiis, deinde TIBIIS Sarranis. The Lydian flutes were grave and solemn, and consequently adapted to grave and solemn purposes. After the play had been acted at that solemnity, it was performed with left-handed flutes, and doubtless on some less mournful occasion. See the preface of Donatus to this comedy. Dacier. There is much ingenuity in the above note of Madam Dacier, who has plainly proved that the title to this play is defective; and so, there is great reason to think, are the titles to the rest of our author's comedies. Yet I cannot entirely agree with her, that such musick could not have been used at a funeral. The ancients, we know, admitted all kinds of games at such solemnities. The musick was most probably suited to the comedy, rather than to the occasion, on which it was exhibited: and Donatus, to whom she refers, tells us in express words, that it was so in the present instance. Modulata est autem tibiis dextris, id est, Lydiis, ob seriam gravitatem, quÃ¢ fere in omnibus comÅdiis utitur hic poeta. SÃ¦pe tamen, mutatis per scenam modis, cantica mutavit: quod significat titulus scenÃ¦, habens subjectas personis literas M. M. C. âIt was composed for right-handed flutes, that is, Lydian, because of the serious vein, which generally prevails in all our author's comedies; the musick however was frequently varied in the course of the scene, as is shewn from the letters M. M. C. that is, mutatis modis cantici, subjoined to the names of the characters.â The learned reader, who will be at the pains to consult Madam Dacier, I believe will agree with me, that she has but partially cited, and inaccurately translated the above extract from the preface of Donatus. I cannot conclude the notes on this title, without taking notice of the happy and elegant use made of the occasion, on which the play was first represented, by my late friend Lloyd, in his Prologue to this Comedy, when acted at Westminster school in the year 1759, soon after the melancholy news of the publick loss sustained by the death of that most eminent military character, General Wolfe. The learned reader, I dare say, will not be sorry to see it entire. Prologus in Adelphos, 1759. Cum Patres Populumque dolor communis haberet, Fleret et Ãmilium Maxima Roma suum, Funebres inter ludos, his dicitur ipfis Scenis extinctum condecorÃ¢sse ducem.

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. The Bard perceiving his piece cavill'd at By partial criticks, and his adversaries Misrepresenting what we're now to play, Pleads his own cause; and you shall be the judges, Whether he merits praise or condemnation. The Synapothescontes A Greek word [????????????????] signifying dying together. Varro somewhere declares that Plautus was not the author of the comedy, called Commorientes, a Latin word of the like import: but he certainly speaks of some other play which bore the same title, or the opinions of men must have differed in his days concerning this matter; some giving it to Plautus, others to Aquilius. Terence however, in my opinion, is an authority most to be depended upon. The play of Plautus is lost. Dacier. is a Piece By Diphilus, Diphilus, as well as Philemon, was a comick poet, cotemporary of Menander. a Comedy which Plautus, Having translated, call'd Commorientes. In the beginning of the GrÃ¦cian play There is a youth, who rends a girl perforce From a procurer: and this incident, Untouch'd by Plautus, render'd word for word, Has our Bard interwoven with his Brothers; The new piece which we represent to-day. Say then if this be theft, Nothing can set the Greek poets in a more exalted light, than to see them, even from the earliest days of the Romans, not only so eagerly read, but so attentively and so carefully translated, that the Latin authors seldom or ever attempted any thing of their own: Donatus, in his preface to this comedy, says of Terence, minus existimans laudis proprias scribere, quam GrÃ¦cas transferre,ââthinking it less praise to invent new plays, than to translate Greek ones.â S. or honest use Of what remain'd unoccupied.âFor that Which malice tells, that Scipio, LÃ¦lius, &amp; Furius Publius.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter MICIO. Ho, Storax! Storax! non rediit has nocte a cÅnÃ¢ Ãschinus. Some consider Micio as asking a question in these words, but they are mistaken. He calls Storax; and finding he does not answer, concludes that neither Ãschinus, nor any of his servants are come home. Donatus.âÃschinus did not return Last night from supper; no, nor any one Of all the slaves, who went to see for him. Qui advorsum ierant. The servants, who went to meet their masters, and defend them home, were called Adversitores. Donatus. â'Tis commonly,âand oh how truly!âsaid, If you are absent, or delay, 'twere best That should befal you, which your wife denounces, Or which in anger she calls down upon you, Than that which kindest parents fear.âYour wife, If you delay, or thinks that you're in love, Or lov'd, or drink, or entertain yourself, Taking your pleasure, while she pines at home. âAnd what a world of fears possess me now! How anxious that my son is not return'd; Lest he take cold, or fall, or break a limb! âGods, that a man should suffer any one To wind himself so close about his heart, As to grow dearer to him than himself! And yet he is not my son, but my brother's, Whose bent of mind is wholly different. I, from youth upward even to this day, Have led a quiet, and serene, town-life; And, as some reckon fortunate, ne'er married. He, in all points the opposite of this, Has past his days entirely in the country With thrift, and labour; married; had two sons. The elder boy is by adoption mine; I've brought him up; kept; lov'd him as my own; Made him my joy, and all my soul holds dear, Striving to make myself as dear to him. I give, o'erlook, nor think it requisite That all his deeds should be controul'd by me, Giving him scope to act as of himself; So that the pranks of youth, which other children Hide from their fathers, I have us'd my son Not to conceal from me. For whosoe'er Hath won upon himself to play the false one, And practise impositions on a father, Will do the same with less remorse to others; And 'tis, in my opinion, better far These sentiments are adopted by Ben Jonson in his Every Man in his Humour, where they are put into the mouth of old Knowell. There is a way of winning more by love, And urging of the modesty, than fear: Force works on servile natures, not the free. He that's compell'd to goodness, may be good; But 'tis but for that fit: where others, drawn By softness and example, get a habit. Then if they stray, but warn them; and the same They shou'd for virtue have done, they'll do for shame. To bind your children to you by the ties Of gentleness and modesty, than fear. And yet my brother don't accord in this, Nor do these notions, nor this conduct please him. Oft he comes open-mouth'dâWhy how now, Micio? Why do you ruin this young lad of our's? Why does he wench? why drink? and why do you Allow him money to afford all this? You let him dress too fine. 'Tis idle in you. â'Tis hard in him, unjust, and out of reason. And he, I think, deceives himself indeed, Who fancies that authority more firm Founded on force, than what is built on friendship; For thus I reason, thus persuade myself: He who performs his duty, driven to't By fear of punishment, while he believes His actions are observ'd, so long he's wary; But if he hopes for secrecy, returns To his own ways again: But he whom kindness, Him also inclination makes your own: He burns to make a due return, and acts, Present or absent, evermore the same. 'Tis this then is the duty of a father. To make a son embrace a life of virtue, Rather from choice, than terror or constraint. Here lies the mighty difference between A father and a master. He who knows not How to do this, let him confess he knows not How to rule children.âBut is this the man, Whom I was speaking of? Yes, yes, 'tis he. He seems uneasy too, I know not why, And I suppose, as usual, comes to wrangle. There are several fine passages in this speech, and good observations on human life; yet it is too long a soliloquy. Cooke. SCENE II. Enter DEMEA. Micio. Demea, I'm glad to see you well. Demea. Oho! The Poet has in this place improved on Menander, in representing Demea as more ready to wrangle with his brother, than to return his compliments. Donatus. Well met: the very man I came to seek. Micio. But you appear uneasy: What's the matter? Demea. Is it a question, when there's Ãschinus To trouble us, what makes me so uneasy? Micio. I said it wou'd be so.âWhat has he done? Demea. What has he done? a wretch, whom neither ties Of shame, nor fear, nor any law can bind! For not to speak of all his former pranks, What has he been about but even now? Micio. What has he done? Demea. Burst open doors, and forc'd The character and passion of Demea is finely marked in the account which he gives of the riot; in which he dwells on every minute particular, endeavouring to multiply and exaggerate the offences of Ãschinus, and concealing every palliating circumstance. Donatus. His way into another's house, and beat The master and his family half-dead; And carried off a wench whom he was fond of. The whole town cries out shame upon him, Micio. I have been told of it a hundred times Since my arrival. 'Tis the common talk.â There is much humour in this passage, when it appears that the son so much commended is the most in fault. Donatus.And if we needs must draw comparisons, Does not he see his brother, thrifty, sober, Attentive to his business in the country? Not given to these practices? and when I say all this to Him, to You I say it. You are his ruin, Micio. Micio. How unjust Is he, who wants experience! who believes Nothing is right, but what he does himself! Demea. Why d'ye say that? Micio. Because you, Demea, Judge wrongly of these matters. 'Tis no crime For a young man to wench, or drink.â'Tis not, Believe me!ânor to force doors open.âThis If neither you nor I have done, it was That poverty allow'd us not. And now You claim a merit to yourself, from that Which want constrain'd you to. It is not fair. For had there been but wherewithall to do't, We likewise should have done thus. Wherefore You, Were you a man, would let your younger son, Now, while it suits his age, persue his pleasures; Rather than, when it less becomes his years, When, after wishing long, he shall at last Be rid of you, he should run riot then. Demea. Oh Jupiter! the man will drive me mad. Is it no crime, d'ye say, for a young man To take these courses? Micio. Nay, nay; do but hear me, Nor stun me with the self same thing for ever! Your elder son you gave me for adoption: He's mine then, Demea; and if he offends, 'Tis an offence to me, and I must bear The burden. The mild character of Micio is contrasted by Tully to that of a furious, severe father, as drawn by the famous comick poet CÃ¦cilius. Both writers are quoted in the oration for CÃ¦lius, in the composition of which it is plain that the orator kept his eye pretty constantly on our poet.âThe passages from CÃ¦cilius contain all that vehemence and severity, which, as Horace tells us, was accounted the common character of the stile of that author. Nunc demum mihi animus ardet, nunc meum cor cumulatur irÃ¢. âO infelix, O scelus!â Egone quid dicam? egone quid velim? quÃ¦ tu omnia tuis fÅdis factis facis, ut nequidquam velim. Cur te in istam vicinitatem meretriciam contulisti? cur illecebris cognitis non refugisti? cur alienam ullam mulierem nosti? dide ac dissice, per me licebit. Si egebis, tibi dolebit: mihi sat est, qui Ã¦tatis quod reliquum est, oblectem meÃ¦. Now my soul burns, now my heart swells with anger. âOh wretch, oh monster!â What can I say? what can I wish? when you By your vile deeds make all my wishes vain? Why did you go into that neighbourhood? Why, knowing her allurements, not avoid them? And why maintain an intercourse so vile? âSpend, squander, dissipate, I give you leave. If want o'ertakes you, you alone will feel it: For my remains of life I've yet enough. Does he treat? or drink? or dress? 'Tis at my cost.âOr wench? I will supply him, While 'tis convenient to me; when 'tis not, Fortasse excludetur foras. I once understood this passage thus: perhaps I may turn him out of doors: but on further consideration I think the sense which I have followed more agreeable to the character of Micio. The fondness he expresses in this sentiment is very remarkable: he does not absolutely say, Ãschinus's mistresses will turn him out of doors, excludetur foras, but fortasse excludetur foras, PERHAPS they MAY turn him out of doors. He is so extremely partial to his adopted son, that he thinks his mistresses would certainly caress him, even though he made them no presents. This expression fortasse has an admirable effect, as was observed by Donatus. Dacier.His mistresses perhaps will shut him out. âHas he broke open doors? we'll make them good. Or torn a coat? it shall be mended. I, Thank heaven, have enough to do all this, And 'tis as yet not irksome.âIn a word, Or cease, or chuse some arbiter between us: I'll prove that you are more in fault than I. Demea. Ah, learn to be a father; learn from those, Who know what 'tis to be indeed a parent! Micio. By nature you're his father, I by counsel. Demea. You! do you counsel any thing? Micio. Nay, nay; If you persist, I'm gone. Demea. Is't thus you treat me? Micio. Must I still hear the same thing o'er and o'er? Demea. It touches me. Micio. And me it touches too. But, Demea, let us each look to our own; Let me take care of one, and mind you t'other. For to concern yourself with both, appears As if you'd redemand the boy you gave. Demea. Ah, Micio! Micio. So it seems to me. Demea. Well, well; Let him, if 'tis your pleasure, waste, destroy, And squander; it is no concern of mine. If henceforth I e'er say one wordâ Micio. Again? Angry again, good Demea? Demea. You may trust me. Do I demand him back again I gave you? âIt hurts me. I am not a stranger to him. âBut if I once opposeâWell, well, I've done. You wish I should take care of One. I do Take special care of him; and he, thank heav'n, Is as I wish he should be: which your ward, I warrant, shall find out one time or other. I will not say ought worse of him at present. [Exit. SCENE III. MICIO alone. Terence seems inclined to favour the part of mild fathers. He represents Micio as affected at his son's irregularities; lest, if he should appear wholly unmoved, he might seem to corrupt his son, rather than to treat him with a proper indulgence. Wherefore, through all his moderation, he still betrays a fatherly emotion. Donatus. Though what he says be not entirely true, There's something in it, and it touches me. But I dissembled my concern with him, Because the nature of the man is such, To pacify, I must oppose and thwart him; And even thus I scarce can teach him patience. But were I to inflame, or aid his anger, I were as great a madman as himself. Yet Ãschinus, 'tis true, has been to blame. What wench is there he has not lov'd? to whom He has not made some present?âAnd but lately (Tir'd, I suppose, and sick of wantonness) The art of Terence in preparing his incidents is wonderful. He contrives that even ignorant persons shall open the plot: as in the present instance, which gives us to understand that Ãschinus had mentioned to Micio his intentions of taking a wife, though he had not entered into particulars. This naturally leads us to the ensuing part of the fable, without forestalling any of the circumstances. Donatus.He told me he propos'd to take a wife. I hop'd the hey-day of the blood was over, And was rejoyc'd: but his intemperance Breaks out afresh.âWell, be it what it may, I'll find him out; and know it instantly, If he is to be met with at the Forum. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter ÃSCHINUS, SANNIO, PARMENO, the Musick Girl, and a Croud of People. San. Help, help, dear countrymen, for heaven's sake! Assist a miserable harmless man! Help the distrest! Ãsch. to the Girl.] Fear nothing: stand just there! Why d'ye look back? you're in no danger. Never, While I am by, shall he lay hands upon you. San. Ay, but I will, in spite of all the world. Ãsch. Rogue as he is, he'll scarce do any thing To make me cudgel him again to-day. San. One word, Sir Ãschinus! that you may not Pretend to ignorance of my profession; I'm a Procurer. He says this to Ãschinus to intimidate him, alluding to the privileges allowed to the Procurers at Athens, on account of the profit accruing to the republick from their traffick in slaves. It was forbid to abuse them, on pain of disinheritance. Hence in Lucian a young man, complaining of being disinherited by his father, says, ??? ??????????? ????????; âwhat slave-merchant accuses me of having mal-treated him?â Dacier. Ãsch. True. San. And in my way Of as good faith as any man alive. Hereafter, to absolve yourself, you'll cry, That you repent of having wrong'd me thus. I shan't care that for your excuse. [snapping his fingers.] Be sure, I'll prosecute my right; nor shall fine words Atone for evil deeds. I know your way. ââI'm sorry that I did it: and I'll swear âYou are unworthy of this injuryââ Though all the while I'm us'd most scurvily. Ãsch. to Par.] Do you go forwards, Parmeno, and throw The door wide open. San. That sha'n't signify. Ãsch. to Parmeno.] Now in with her! San. stepping between.] I'll not allow it. Ãsch. to Parmeno.] Here! Come hither, Parmeno!âyou're too far off.â Stand close to that Pimp's sideâThereâthereâjust there! And now be sure you always keep your eyes Stedfastly fix'd on mine; and when I wink, To drive your fist directly in his face. San. Ay, if he dare. Ãsch. to Par.] Now mind!â[to Sannio.] Let go the girl! [Sannio still struggling with the Girl, Ãschinus winks, and Parmeno strikes Sannio. San. Oh monstrous! Ãsch. He shall double it, unless You mend your manners. [Parmeno strikes Sannio again. San. Help, help: murder, murder! Ãsch. to Parmeno.] I did not wink: but you had better err That way than t'other.âNow go in with her. [Parmeno leads the Girl into Micio's House. San. How's this?âDo you reign King here, Ãschinus? Ãsch. Did I reign King, you should be recompens'd According to your virtues, I assure you. San. What business have you with me? Ãsch. None. San. D'ye know Nostin' qui sim? A law term, signifying, âDo I owe you any thing?â Donatus. Who I am, Ãschinus? Ãsch. Nor want to know. San. Have I touch'd ought of your's, Sir? Ãsch. If you had, You should have suffer'd for't. San. What greater right Have you to take away my slave, for whom I paid my money? answer me! Ãsch. 'Twere best, You'd leave off bellowing before our door: If you continue to be troublesome, I'll have you dragg'd into the house, and there Lash'd without mercy. San. How, a freeman lash'd! Ãsch. Ev'n so. San. O monstrous tyranny! Is this, Is this the liberty they boast of here, Common to all? Ãsch. If you have brawl'd enough, Please to indulge me with one word, you Pimp. San. Who has brawl'd most, yourself, or I? Ãsch. Well, well! No more of that, but to the point! San. What point? What wou'd you have? Ãsch. Will you allow me then To speak of what concerns you? San. Willingly: Speak but in justice. Ãsch. Very fine! a Pimp, And talks of justice! San. Well, I am a Pimp; This seems to be a translation from Diphilus, from whom this part of the fable was taken. ??? ????? ???? ??????? ??????????? ??? ???????????. No calling is more baneful and pernicious, Than that of a Procurer. Westerhovious. The Procurer was a common character in the comedy of the antients; but if we may pronounce from their remains, we may venture to say that the character was never so finely painted in any part of their works, as in the following lines of Shakespeare. Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd! The evil that thou causest to be done, That is thy means to live. Dost thou but think, What 'tis to cram a maw, or cloath a back From such a filthy vice? Say to thyself, From their abominable and beastly touches I drink, I eat, array myself, and live. Canst thou believe thy living is a life, So stinkingly depending! Go mend, mend. Measure for Measure. The common bane of youth, a perjurer, A publick nuisance, I confess it: yet I never did You wrong. Ãsch. No, that's to come. San. Prithee return to whence you first set out, Sir! Ãsch. You, plague upon you for it! bought the girl For twenty MinÃ¦; which sum we will give you. San. What if I do not chuse to sell the girl? Will you oblige me? Ãsch. No. San. I fear'd you would. Ãsch. She's a free-woman, and should not be sold, And, as such, Ego liberali illam assero causÃ¢ manu. Law terms. The defenders of the liberty of another were called Assertores, and the suit commenced on that account called Liberalis causa, an action of freedom. Donatus. by due course of law I claim her. Now then consider which you like the best, To take the money, or maintain your action. Think on this, Pimp, till I come back again. [Exit. SCENE II. SANNIO alone. Oh Jupiter! I do not wonder now That men run mad with injuries. He drags me Out of my own house; cudgels me most soundly; And carries off my slave against my will: And after this ill treatment, he demands The Musick-Girl to be made over to him, At the same price I bought her.âHe has pour'd His blows upon me, thick as hail; for which, Since he deserves so nobly at my hands, He should no doubt be gratified.âNay, nay, Let me but touch the cash, I'm still content. But this I guess will be the case: as soon As I shall have agreed to take his price, He'll produce witnesses immediately, To prove that I have sold her.âAnd the money Will be mere moon-shine.ââBy and by.âââTo morrow.â âYet I could bear that too, tho' much wrong, Might I but get the money after all: For thus it is, friend Sannio; when a man Has taken up this trade, he must receive, And pocket the affronts of young gallants. âBut nobody will pay me, and I draw Conclusions to no purpose. SCENE III. Enter SYRUS. Syrus. to Ãsch. within.] Say no more! Let me alone to talk with him! I warrant I'll make him take the money; ay, and own That he's well treated too. [coming forward. Why how now, Sannio? What's the dispute I overheard just now 'Twixt you and my young master? San. Never was Any dispute conducted more unfairly, Than that between us two to-day! Poor I With being drubb'd, and he with drubbing me, 'Till we were both quite weary. Syrus. All your fault. San. What could I do? Syrus. Give a young man his way. San. What could I give him more, who gave my face? Syrus. Nay, but d'ye know my meaning, Sannio? To seem upon occasion to slight money, Proves in the end, sometimes, the greatest gain. Why prithee, blockhead, could you be afraid, Had you abated somewhat of your right, And humour'd the young gentleman, he would not Have paid you back again with interest? San. I never purchase hope with ready money. Syrus. Away! you'll never thrive. You do not know How to ensnare men, Sannio. San. Well, perhaps, Your way were best: yet I was ne'er so crafty But I had rather, when 'twas in my power, Receive prompt payment. Syrus. Pshaw! I know your spirit: As if you valued Twenty MinÃ¦ now, So you might do a kindness to my master! âBesides they say you're setting out for Cyprus. [carelessly. San. Ha! [alarm'd. Syrus. âAnd have bought up a large stock of goods To carry over thither.âHir'd a vessel. That 'tis, I know, which keeps you in suspence: When you return, I hope, you'll settle this. San. I shall not budge a foot.âUndone, by heav'n! Urg'd by these hopes they've undertaken this. [aside. Syrus. He fears. I've thrown a small rub in his way. [aside. San. to himself.] Confusion! they have nick'd me to a hair! In ipso articulo oppressit. Literally, âhit me in the very jointâ. I've bought up sev'ral slaves, and other wares, For exportation; and to miss my time The merchants used to buy up slaves in all parts of Greece, to sell them at Cyprus, where a celebrated fair was kept for that purpose. Dacier.At Cyprus-fair would be a heavy loss. Then if I leave this business broken thus, All's over with me; and at my return 'Twill come to nothing, grown quite cold and stale. ââWhat! come at last?âWhy did you stay so long? âWhere have you been?ââthat it were better lose it, Than wait for it so long, or sue for't then. Syrus, coming up to him.] Jamne enumerasti id, quod ad te rediturum putes? I have translated these words according to the interpretation of Donatus. Madam Dacier puts another sense upon them, and thinks they rather mean Sannio's calculation of his profits at Cyprus. The subsequent conversation between Syrus and Sannio inclined me rather to adopt the former opinion.Well, have you calculated what's your due? San. Monstrous oppression! Is this honourable, Or just in Ãschinus, to take away My property by force? Syrus. So, so! he comes. [aside. âI have but one word more to say to you. See, how you like it.âRather, Sannio, Than run the risk to get or lose the whole, E'en halve the matter: and he shall contrive To scrape together by some means Syrus knew very well that Ãschinus was ready to pay the whole, but offers Sannio half, that he might be glad to take his bare principal, and think himself well off into the bargain. Donatus. Ten MinÃ¦. San. Alas, alas! am I in danger then Of losing ev'n my very principal? Shame on him! he has loosen'd all my teeth: My head is swell'd all over like a mushroom: And will he cheat me too?âI'm going no where. Syrus. Just as you please.âHave you ought else to say, Before I go? San. Yes, one word, prithee Syrus! However things have happen'd, rather than I should be driven to commence a suit, Let him return me my bare due at least; The sum she cost me, Syrus.âI'm convinc'd You've had no tokens of my friendship yet; But you shall find I will not be ungrateful. Syrus. I'll do my best. But I see Ctesipho. He is rejoic'd about his mistress. San. Say, Will you remember me? Syrus. Hold, hold a little! [Syrus and Sannio retire. SCENE IV. Enter CTESIPHO at another part of the Stage. Ctes. Favours are welcome in the hour of need From any hand; but doubly welcome, when Conferr'd by those, from whom we most expect them. O brother, brother, how shall I applaud thee? Ne'er can I rise to such a height of praise But your deservings will out-top me still: For in this point I am supremely blest, That none can boast so excellent a brother, So rich in all good qualities, as I. Syrus, coming forward.] O Ctesipho! Ctes. turning round.] O Syrus! where's my brother? Syrus. At home, where he expects you. Ctes. Ha! [joyfully.] Syrus. What now? Ctes. What now!âBy his assistance I live, Syrus. Ah, he's a friend indeed! who disregarding All his own interests for my advantage, The scandal, infamy, intrigue, and blame, All due to me, has drawn upon himself! What could exceed it?âBut who's there?âThe door Creaks on the hinges. [offering to go off. Syrus. Hold! 'tis Ãschinus. SCENE V. Enter ÃSCHINUS. Ãsch. Where is that rascal? The character of Sannio is well sustained. He immediately takes to himself the infamous name of rascal, and acknowleges it with joy, thinking he is enquired after, in order to be paid; and droops afterwards, not on account of hard words and ill usage, but only for fear he should not get his money. Donatus. San. behind.] He enquires for me. Has he brought out the cash with him?âConfusion! I see none. Ãsch. to Ctesipho.] Ha! well met: I long'd to see you. How is it, Ctesipho? All's safe. Away With melancholy! Ctes. Melancholy! I Be melancholy, who have such a brother? Oh my dear Ãschinus! thou best of brothers, âAh, I'm asham'd to praise you to your face, Lest it appear to come from flattery, Rather than gratitude. Ãsch. Away, you fool! As if we did not know each other, Ctesipho. It only grieves me, we so lately knew this, When things were almost come to such a pass, That all the world, had they desir'd to do it, Could not assist you. Ctes. 'Twas my modesty. Ãsch. Pshaw! it was folly, and not modesty. For such a trifle, almost In Menander the young man was on the point of killing himself. Terence has softened this circumstance. Donatus. We know that the circumstance of carrying off the Musick-Girl was borrowed from Diphilus: yet it is plain that there was also an intrigue of Ctesipho's in the play of Menander: which gives another proof of the manner in which Terence used the Greek Comedies. fly your country? Heaven forbid it!âfie, fie, Ctesipho! Ctes. I've been to blame. Ãsch. Well, what says Sannio? Syrus. He's pacified at last. Ãsch. I'll to the Forum, And pay him off.âYou, Ctesipho, go in To the poor girl. San. Now urge the matter, Syrus! [apart to Syrus. Syrus. Let's go; for Sannio wants to be at Cyprus. A piece of arch malice in Syrus, in order to teaze Sannio. Donatus. San. Not in such haste: tho' truly I've no cause To loiter here. Syrus. You shall be paid: ne'er fear! San. But all? Syrus. Yes, all: so hold your tongue, and follow! San. I will. [Exit after ÃschinusâSyrus going. Ctes. Hist! hark ye, Syrus! Syrus, turning back.] Well, what now? Ctes. For heaven's sake discharge that scurvy fellow Immediately; for fear, if further urg'd, This tale should reach my father's ears: and then I am undone for ever. Syrus. It sha'n't be. Be of good courage! meanwhile, get you in, And entertain yourself with Her; and order The couches to be spread, and all prepar'd. For, these preliminaries once dispatch'd, I shall march homewards with provisions. Ctes. Do! And since this business has turn'd out so well, Let's spend the day in mirth and jollity! [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SOSTRATA, CANTHARA. Sos. Prithee, good nurse, how will it go with her? Can. How go with her? Why well, I warrant you. Sos. Her pains begin to come upon her, nurse. Can. You're as much frighten'd at your time of day, As if you ne'er was present at a labour, Or never had been brought to bed yourself. Sos. Alas, I've no soul here: we're all alone. Geta is absent; nor is there a creature To fetch a midwife, or call Ãschinus. Can. He'll be here presently, I promise you: For he, good man, ne'er lets a single day Go by, but he is sure to visit us. Sos. He is my only comfort in my sorrows. Can. Troth, as the case stands, madam, circumstances Could not have happen'd better than they have: And since your daughter suffer'd violence, 'Twas well she met with such a man as this; A man of honour, rank, and family. Sos. He is, indeed, a worthy gentleman: The Gods preserve him to us! SCENE II. Enter GETA hastily at another part of the Stage. Geta. We are now So absolutely lost, that all the world Joining in consultation to apply Relief to the misfortune, that has fallen On me, my mistress, and her daughter, all Wou'd not avail.âAh me! so many troubles Environ us at once, we sink beneath them. Rape, poverty, oppression, solitude, And infamy! oh, what an age is this! O wicked, oh vile race!âoh impious man! Sos. to Canthara.] Ah, why should Geta seem thus terrified, And agitated? Geta, to himself.] Wretch! whom neither honour, Nor oaths, nor pity could controul or move! Nor her approaching labour; her, on whom He shamefully committed violation! Sos. I don't well understand him. Can. Prithee then Let us draw nearer, Sostrata! Geta, to himself.] Alas, I'm scarcely in my perfect mind, I burn With such fierce anger.âOh, that I had all That villain-family before me now, That I might vent my indignation on them, While yet it boils within me.âThere is nothing I'd not endure to be reveng'd on them. First I'd tread out the stinking snuff his father, Who gave the monster being.âAnd then, Syrus, Who urg'd him to it,âhow I'd tear him!âFirst, I'd seize him round the waist, and lift him high, Then dash his head against the ground, and strew The pavement with his brains.âFor Ãschinus, I'd tear his eyes out, and then tumble him, Headforemost down some precipice.âThe rest I'd rush on, drag, crush, trample underfoot. But why do I delay to tell my mistress This heavy news as soon as possible? [going. Sos. Let's call him back.âHo, Geta! Geta. Whosoe'er You are, excuse me. Geta's reply is founded on a frolicksome, but ill-natured custom, which prevailed in Greece; to stop the slaves in the streets, and designedly keep them in chat, so that they might be lashed when they came home, for staying out so long. Dacier. Sos. I am Sostrata. Geta. Where, where is Sostrata? [turns about.] I sought you, Madam; Impatiently I fought you: and am glad To have encounter'd you thus readily. Sos. What is the matter? why d'ye tremble thus? Geta. Alas! Sos. Take breath!âBut why thus mov'd, good Geta? Geta. We're quiteâ Sos. Quite what? Geta. Undone: We're ruin'd, Madam. Sos. Explain, for heaven's sake! Geta. Ev'n nowâ Sos. What now? Geta. Ãschinusâ Sos. What of Ãschinus? Geta. Has quite Estrang'd himself from all our family. Sos. How's that? confusion! why? Geta. He loves another. Sos. Wretch that I am! Geta. Nor that clandestinely; But snatch'd her in the face of all the world From a procurer. Sos. Are you sure of this? Geta. Sure? With these very eyes I saw it, Madam. Sos. Alas, alas! What then can we believe? To whom give credit?âWhat? our Ãschinus! Nostrumne Ãschinum? &amp;c. There is something extremely touching in this manner of speaking. Shakespeare, whose works contain examples of every species of beauty in poetry, affords us a very elegant instance of this irregular manner, which, addressing itself to the passions, affects us more sensibly than set forms of speech. The turn of phrase, in which Desdemona pleads for Cassio, is a good deal similar to the way in which Sostrata here speaks of Ãschinus. ?What? Michael Cassio?â That came a wooing with you, and many a time, When I have spoke of you dispraisingly, Hath ta'en your part, to have so much to do To bring him in! Othello. Our very life, our sole support, and hope! Who swore he could not live one day without her, And promis'd he would place the new-born babe Upon his father's lap, The Grecians, as soon as they had a child born, immediately put it on the grandfather's knee if he were living. PhÅnix in the ninth Iliad says that his father loaded him with curses, and invoked the Furies, conjuring them that no child of his son might be placed on his knees. ? ????? ??????, ?????? ???????, ????? ????????, ???????? ???????????? ???????, ?? ???? ???????? ????? ?????????? ????? ???? ?? ?????? ???????. Iliad, l. ix. v. 453. Mr. Pope's translation not having preserved that idea, the liberty has been taken, of adding two lines. My sire with curses loads my hated head, And cries, âYe Furies! barren be his bed.â Never, dread sisters, never may I see A child, his offspring, plac'd upon my knee! See Pope's Iliad, b. 9. v. 582. This custom did not prevail among the Romans: our author, notwithstanding, as he translated his play from the Greek, judiciously preserves that usage. Dacier. and in that way Wring from him his consent to marry her! Geta. Nay, weep not, mistress; but consider rather What course were best to follow: to conceal. This wrong, or to disclose it to some friend? Can. Disclose it! Are you mad? Is this a thing To be disclos'd, d'ye think? Geta. I'd not advise it. For first, that he has quite abandon'd us, The thing itself declares. If we then make The story known, no doubt but he'll deny it. Your reputation, and your daughter's life Will be endanger'd: or if he confess, Since he affects another, 'twere not good That he should wed your daughter.âFor which reasons, Silence is requisite. Sos. Ah, no: not I. Geta. What mean you? Sos. To disclose the whole. Geta. How, Madam! Think what you are about. Sos. Whatever happens, The thing can't be in a worse state than now. In the first place my daughter has no portion, And that which should have been her second dowry, Is also lost; and she can ne'er be giv'n In marriage as a virgin. For the rest, If he denies his former commerce with her, I have the ring he lost to vouch the fact. In short, since I am conscious to myself, That I am not to blame in this proceeding, And that no sordid love of gain, nor aught, Unworthy of my daughter or myself, Has mixt in this affair, I'll try it, Geta. Geta. Well, I agree, 'twere better to disclose it. Accedo, ut melius dicas. Nothing can be plainer than these words. Yet they have been the occasion of great perplexity to commentators and translators. Madam Dacier gives them a sense directly opposite to that which I have followed. Ah, qu'allez vous faire? je vous en prie changez de sentiment. Echard, who keeps his eye more constantly on the French translation, than on the original, says, much to the same purpose, D'ye think so? Pray think on't again. Cooke has it, How? let me advise you to think better of it. Westerhovius supposes Sostrata to have seemed angry with Geta, and therefore explains ut melius dicas to signify ut bona verba loquarisâthat you may speak mildly. Patrick justly thinking that this is too strained, and no satisfying answer to Sostrata; and, from what follows, seeing the necessity of explaining Geta's answer, so as to make it imply an assent, supposes an elleipsis, and supplies it thus. Accedo tibi, ut qui melius dicas.âI submit to you, as you seem to speak with more justice. All these interpretations are founded on the supposition that melius is the accusative governed by dicas. I have no doubt but that melius is here used adverbially, which will lead us to this easy construction, Accedo, melius ut dicas;âI agree, that you may better tell it; implying Geta's coming into her opinion on the point in dispute. The remark of Donatus on this passage, ut consentiam, velut qui melius possim dicere, is certainly corrupted; but if we read, as we are told it stands in some copies, veluti melius potens sis dicere, it will give the same sense that I have followed. Eugraphius in his long note on the words Hera, lacrumas mitte! weep not, mistress! plainly understands them in this manner. But, as a greater authority than all commentators, I shall appeal to Terence himself; and submit the whole context, as it stands in the original, to the judgment of the learned reader.âThese verbal criticisms are dry and unpleasant both to the writer and reader. I very frequently avoid them: but in a controverted passage, where the sense is materially concerned, it would seem indolence or arrogance not to submit to them. G. Hera, lacrumas mitte, ac potius, quod ad hanc rem opu', porro prospice. Patiamurne, an narremus cuipiam? C. au, au mi homo, san un' es? An hoc proferendum tibi usquam esse videtur? G. mihi quidem non placet. Jam primum, illum alieno animo Ã  nobis esse, res ipsa indicat. Nunc si hoc palam proferimus, ille inficias ibit, sat scio; Tua fama, &amp; gnatÃ¦ vita in dubium veniet. tum si maxume Fateatur, cum ametaliam, non est utile hanc illi dari. Quapropter, quoquo pacto tacito est opus. S. ah, minime gentium: Non faciam. G. quid ages? S. proferam. G. hem, mea Sostrata, vide quam rem agas. S. Pejore res loco non potis est esse, quam in hoc, quo nunc sita est. Primum indotata est: tum prÃ¦terea, quÃ¦ secunda ei dos erat, Periit: pro virgine dari nuptum non potest: hoc relliquum est, Si inficias ibit, testis mecum est annulus, quem amiserat. Postremo, quando ego conscia mÃ® sum, Ã  me culpam hanc procul esse, nec Pretium, neque rem ullam intercesse illa aut me indignam; experiar, Geta. G. Quid istic? accedo, ut melius dicas. S. tu, quantum potest, abi, &amp;c. Sos. You then away, as fast as possible, And run to Hegio our good friend and kinsman, To let him know the whole affair: for He Was the chief friend of my dear Simulus, And ever shew'd a great regard for Us. Geta. And well he does, for no one else cares for us. Sos. And you, good Canthara, away with haste, And call a midwife; that we may be sure Of her assistance in the time of need. [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. Enter DEMEA. Dem. Confusion! I have heard that Ctesipho Was present with his brother at this riot. This is the sum of all my miseries, If He, even He, a sober, hopeful, lad, May be seduc'd into debaucheries. âBut where shall I enquire for him? I warrant They have decoy'd him into some vile brothel. That profligate persuaded him, I'm sure. âBut here comes Syrus; He can tell me all. And yet this slave is of the gang; and if He once perceives that I'm enquiring for him, He'll never tell me any thing, a rogue! I'll not discover my design. SCENE IV. Enter SYRUS at another part of the Stage. Syrus, to himself.] We've just Disclos'd the whole of this affair to Micio, Exactly as it happen'd. I ne'er saw The good old gentleman more pleas'd. Dem. Oh heav'n, The folly of the man! [listening. Syrus, to himself.] He prais'd his son; Me, who concerted the whole scheme, he thank'd. Dem. I burst with rage. [listening. Syrus, to himself.] He told the money down Immediately, and threw us in beside, To make an entertainment, a Half-Mina: Which I've laid out according to my liking. Dem. So! if you'd have your business well ta'en care of, Commit it to this fellow! Syrus, overhearing.] Who's there? Demea! I did not see you, Sir. How goes it? Dem. How? I can't sufficiently admire your conduct. Syrus, negligently.] Silly enough, to say the truth, and idle To servants within.]âCleanse you the rest of those fish, Dromo: Let That large eel play a little in the water. When I return it shall be bon'd; till then It must not be. Dem. Are crimes like theseâ Syrus, to Demea.] Indeed I like them not, and oft cry shame upon them. âTo servants within.] See that those salt fish are well soak'd, Stephanio. Dem. Gods, is this done on purpose? Does he think 'Tis laudable to spoil his son? Alas! I think I see the day, when Ãschinus Shall fly for want, and list himself a soldier. Syrus. O Demea! That is to be wise: To see, Not that alone which lies before your feet, But ev'n to pry into futurity. Dem. What? is the Musick-Girl at your house? Syrus. Ay, Madam's within. Dem. What! and is Ãschinus To keep her at home with him? Syrus. I believe so; Such is their madness. Dem. Is it possible? Syrus. A fond, and foolish father! Dem. I'm asham'd To own my brother. I'm griev'd for him. Syrus. Ah! There is a deal of diff'rence, Demea, âNor is't, because you're present, that I say thisâ There is a mighty difference between you! You are, from top to toe, all over wisdom: He, a mere dotard.âWould you e'er permit Your boy to do such things? Dem. Permit him? I? Or should I not much rather smell him out Six months before he did but dream of it? Syrus. Pshaw! do you boast your vigilance to Me? Dem. Heav'n keep him ever, as he is at present! Syrus. As fathers form their children, so they prove. Dem. But now we're speaking of him, have you seen The lad to-day? [with an affected carelessness. Syrus. Your son d'ye mean?âI'll drive him Into the country. [aside.]âHe is hard at work Upon your grounds by this time. [to Demea. Dem. Are you sure on't? Syrus. Sure? I set out with him myself. Dem. Good! good! I was afraid he loiter'd here. [aside. Syrus. And much Enrag'd, I promise you. Dem. On what account? Syrus. A quarrel with his Brother at the Forum, About the Musick-Girl. Dem. Indeed? Syrus. Ay, faith: He did not mince the matter: he spoke out. For as the cash was telling down, in pops, All unexpected, Master Ctesipho: Cries out,ââOh Ãschinus, are these your courses? âDo you commit these crimes; and do you bring âSuch a disgrace upon our family?â Dem. Oh, oh, I weep for joy. Syrus. ââYou squander not âThe money only, but your life, your honour.â Dem. Heav'n bless him! He is like his ancestors. [weeping. Syrus. Father's own son, I warrant him. Dem. Oh, Syrus! He's full of all those precepts, He! Syrus. No doubt on't: He need not go from home for good instruction. Dem. I spare no pains; neglect no means: I train him. âIn short I bid him look into the lives Of all, as in a mirror, and thence draw From others an example for himself. ââDo this.ââ Syrus. Good! Dem. âFly that.â Syrus. Very good! Dem. âThis deed âIs commendable.â Syrus. That's the thing! Dem. âThat's reprehensible.â Syrus. Most excellent! Dem. âAnd then moreoverâ Syrus. Faith, I have not time To give you further audience just at present. I've got an admirable dish of fish; And I must take good care they are not spoilt. For that were an offence as grievous, Demea, In Us, as 'twere in You to leave undone The things you just now mention'd: and I try, According to my weak abilities, To teach my fellow-slaves the self-same way. ââThis is too salt.âThis is burnt-up too much. ââThat is not nice and cleanly.âThat's well done. âMind, and do so again.ââI spare no pains, And give them the best precepts that I can. In short, I bid them look into the dishes, As in a mirror, Demea, and thence learn The duty of a cook.âThis school of our's, I own, is idle: but what can you do? According to the man must be the lesson. âWould you aught else with us? Dem. Your reformation. Syrus. Do you go hence into the country? Dem. Strait. Syrus. For what should you do here, where nobody, However good your precepts, cares to mind them? [Exit. SCENE V. DEMEA alone. I then will hence, since he, on whose account I hither came, is gone into the country. He is my only care, He's my concern, My Brother, since he needs will have it so, May look to Ãschinus himself.âBut who Is coming yonder? Hegio, of our tribe? We are told that the Athenians were divided into tribes, but writers are not agreed as to their number. Some say twelve, in imitation of the Jewish tribes: but what connection was there between the Athenians and Jews? It is probable that this number was derived from the twelve months of the year: for we find that there were also in every tribe thirty subdivisions, alluding to the number of days in a month. Patrick. If I see plainly, beyond doubt 'tis he. Ah, we've been old acquaintance quite from boys; And such men now-a-days are wondrous scarce. A citizen of ancient faith and virtue! The commonwealth will ne'er reap harm from Him. How I rejoice to see but the remains Of this old stock! Ah, life's a pleasure now. I'll wait, that I may ask about his health, And have a little conversation with him. SCENE VI. Enter HEGIO, GETA conversing at a distance. Hegio. Good heaven! a most unworthy action, Geta! Can it be true? Geta. Ev'n so. Hegio. A deed so base Sprung from that family?âOh Ãschinus, I'm sure this was not acting like your father. Demea, behind.] So! he has heard about this Musick-Girl, And is affected at it, tho' a stranger, While his good father truly thinks it nothing. Oh monstrous! wou'd that he were somewhere nigh, And heard all this! Hegio. Unless they do what's just, They shall not carry off the matter thus. Geta. Our only hope is in you, Hegio. You're our sole friend, our guardian, and our father. The good old Simulus, on his death-bed, Bequeath'd us to your care. If you desert us, We are undone indeed. Hegio. Ah, name it not! I will not, and, with honesty, I cannot. Dem. I'll go up to him.âSave you, Hegio! Hegio. The man I look'd for.âSave you, Demea! Dem. Your pleasure! Hegio. Ãschinus, your elder son, Adopted by your brother, has committed A deed unworthy of an honest man, And of a gentleman. Dem. How so? Hegio. You knew Our friend and good acquaintance, Simulus? Dem. Ay, sure. Hegio. He has debauch'd his daughter. Dem. How! Hegio. Hold, Demea; for the worst is still to come. Dem. Is there aught worse? Hegio. Much worse: for this perhaps Might be excus'd. The night, love, wine, and youth Might prompt him. 'Tis the frailty of our nature. âSoon as his sense returning made him conscious Of his rash outrage, of his own accord He came to the girl's mother, weeping, praying, Intreating, vowing constancy, and swearing That he would take her home.âHe was forgiven; The thing conceal'd; and his vows credited. The girl from that encounter prov'd with child: This is the tenth month. Lunar months: the common method of computation before Julius CÃ¦sar. Westerhovius.âHe, good gentleman, Has got a Musick-Girl, heav'n bless the mark! With whom he means to live, and quit the other. Dem. And are you well assur'd of this? Hegio. The mother, The girl, the fact itself, are all before you, Joining to vouch the truth on't. And besides, This Geta hereâas servants go, no bad one, Nor given up to idlenessâmaintains them; The sole support of all the family. Here take him, bind him, force the truth from him. Geta. Ay, torture me, if 'tis not so, good Demea! Nay, Ãschinus, I'm sure, will not deny it. Bring me before him. Dem. aside.] I'm asham'd: and what To do, or what to say to him, I know not. Pamphila, within.] Ah me! I'm torn in pieces!âRacking pains! This is the second instance in our author of the outcries of a woman in labour: a circumstance not easily to be reconciled to modern notions of decency, though certainly considered as no indecorum in those days. I shall not defend the practice; but cannot help observing, that allowing such an incident, Terence in the present instance makes a most pathetick and oratorical use of it. Juno Lucina, help me! save, I pray thee! Hegio. Ha! Is she then in labour, Geta? Geta. Yes, Sir. Hegio. Hark! she now calls upon your justice, Demea! Grant her then freely, what law else will claim. And heaven send, that you may rather do What honour bids! But if you mean it not, Be sure of this; that with my utmost force I'll vindicate the girl, and her dead father. He was my kinsman: In Menander, Hegio was the brother of Sostrata. Westerhovius. we were bred together From children; and our fortunes twin'd together In war, and peace, and bitter poverty. Wherefore I'll try, endeavour, strive, nay lose My life itself, before I will forsake them. âWhat is your answer? Dem. I'll find out my brother: What he advises, I will follow, Hegio. Quod mihi de hÃ¢c re dederit consilium, id sequar. Madam Dacier rejects this line, because it is also to be found in the Phormio. But it is no uncommon thing with our author to use the same expression or verse in different places, especially on familiar occasions. There is no impropriety in it here, and the foregoing hemistich is rather lame without it. The propriety of consulting Micio, or Demea's present ill-humour with him, are of no consequence. The old man is surprized at Hegio's story, does not know what to do or to say, and means to evade giving a positive answer, by saying that he would consult his brother. Hegio. But still remember, Demea, that the more You live at ease; the more your pow'r, your wealth, Your riches, and nobility; the more It is your duty to act honourably, If you regard the name of honest men. Dem. Go to: we'll do you justice. Hegio. 'Twill become you. Geta, conduct me into Sostrata. [Exit with Geta. SCENE VII. DEMEA alone. This is no more than I foretold: and well If his intemperance wou'd stop here!âBut this Immoderate indulgence must produce Some terrible misfortune in the end. âI'll hence, find out my brother, tell my news, And empty all my indignation on him. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Re-enter HEGIO, speaking to Sostrata at the Door. Be of good cheer, my Sostrata; and comfort, As much as in your pow'r, poor Pamphila! I'll find out Micio, if he's at the Forum, And tell him the whole story: if he'll act With honour in it, why 'tis well; if not, Let him but speak his mind to me, and then I shall know how to act accordingly. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. CTESIPHO, SYRUS. Ctes. My father gone into the country, say you? Syrus. Long since. Ctes. Nay; speak the truth! Syrus. He's at his farm, And hard at work, I warrant you. Ctes. I wish, So that his health were not the worse for it, He might so heartily fatigue himself, As to be forc'd to keep his bed these three days! Syrus. I wish so too; and more, if possible. Ctes. With all my heart: for I wou'd fain consume, As I've begun, the live-long day in pleasure. Nor do I hate that farm of our's so much For any thing, as that it is so near. For if 'twas at a greater distance, night Would come upon him, ere he could return. But now, not finding me, I'm very sure He'll hobble back again immediately; Question me where I've been, that I've not seen him All the day long; and what shall I reply? Syrus. What? can you think of nothing? Ctes. No, not I. Syrus. So much the worse.âHave you no client, friend, Or guest? Ctes. I have. What then? Syrus. You've been engag'd With them. Ctes. When not engag'd? It cannot be. Syrus. It may. Ctes. Ay marry, for the day I grant you. But if I pass the night here, what excuse Then, Syrus? Syrus. Ah! I would it were the custom To be engag'd at night too with one's friends! âBut be at ease! I know his mind so well, That when he raves the loudest, I can make him As gentle as a lamb. Ctes. How so? Syrus. He loves To hear you prais'd. I sing your praises to him, And make you out a little God. Ctes. Me! Syrus. You. And then the old man blubbers like a child, For very joy.âBut have a care! [looking out. Ctes. What now? Syrus. The wolf i'th'fable! Lupus in fabulÃ¢. A proverb, signifying that the person, of whom we are speaking, is at hand. Ctes. What, my father? Syrus. He. Ctes. What's the best, Syrus? Syrus. In! fly! I'll take care. Ctes. You have not seen me, if he asks: d'ye hear? Syrus. Can't you be quiet? [pushes out Ctesipho. SCENE II. Enter DEMEA at another part of the Stage. Dem. Verily, I am A most unhappy man! for first of all, I cannot find my brother any where: And then besides, in looking after him, I chanc'd on one of my day-labourers, The poet artfully contrives to detain Demea in town, his presence being necessary in the subsequent part of the fable. Donatus. Who had but newly left my farm, and told me Ctesipho was not there. What shall I do? Ctesipho, (apart.) peeping out.] Syrus? Syrus. (apart.) What? Ctes. (apart.) Does he seek me? Syrus. (apart.) Yes. Ctes. (apart.) Undone! Syrus. (apart.) Courage! Demea, to himself.] Plague on it, what ill luck is this! I can't account for it: but I believe That I was born for nothing but misfortunes. I am the first who feels our woes; the first Who knows of them; the first who tells the news; And come what may, I bear the weight alone. Syrus, behind.] Ridiculous! he says he knows all first; And he alone is ignorant of all. Dem. I'm now return'd to see if Micio Be yet come home again. Ctes. (apart.) peeping out.] Take care, good Syrus, He don't rush in upon us unawares! Syrus. (apart.) Peace! I'll take care. Ctes. (apart.) 'Faith, I'll not trust to you, But shut myself and her in some bye place Together: that's the safest. Syrus. (apart.) Well, away! [Ctesipho disappears. I'll drive the old man hence, I warrant you. Dem. seeing Syrus.] But see that rascal Syrus coming hither! Syrus, advancing hastily, and pretending not to see Demea.] By Hercules, there is no living here, For any one, at this rate.âI'd fain know How many masters I'm to have.âOh monstrous! Dem. What does he howl for? what's the meaning on't? Hark ye, my good Sir! prithee tell me, if My brother is at home. Syrus. My good Sir! Plague! Why do you come with your Good Sirs to me? I'm half kill'd. Dem. What's the matter? Syrus. What's the matter! Ctesipho, vengeance on him, fell upon me, And cudgel'd me and the poor Musick-Girl Almost to death. Dem. Indeed? Syrus. Indeed. Nay see How he has cut my lip! [pretending to shew it. Dem. On what account? Syrus. The girl, he says, was bought by my advice. Dem. Did not you say you saw him out of town A little while ago? Syrus. And so I did. But he came back soon after, like a madman. He had no mercy.âWas not he asham'd To beat a poor old fellow? to beat Me; Who bore him in my arms but t'other day, An urchin thus high? [shewing. Dem. Oh rare, Ctesipho! Father's own son! A man, I warrant him. Syrus. Oh rare, d'ye cry? I'faith if he is wise, He'll hold his hands another time. Dem. Oh brave! Syrus. Oh mighty brave, indeed!âBecause he beat A helpless girl, and me a wretched slave, Who durst not strike again;âoh, to be sure, Mighty brave truly! Dem. Oh, most exquisite! My Ctesipho perceiv'd, as well as I, That you was the contriver of this business. âBut is my brother here? Syrus. Not he. [sulkily. Dem. I'm thinking Where I shall seek him. Syrus. I know where he is: But I'll not tell. Dem. How, sirrah? Syrus. Even so. Dem. I'll break your head. Syrus. I cannot tell the name Of him he's gone to, but I know the place. Dem. Well, where's the place? Syrus. D'ye know the Portico Just by the market, down this way? [pointing. Dem. I do. Syrus. Go up that street; keep strait along: and then You'll see a hill; go strait down that: and then On this hand, there's a chapel; and just by A narrow lane. [pointing. Dem. Where? [looking. Syrus. There; by the great wild fig-tree. D'ye know it, Sir? Dem. I do. Syrus. Go through that lane. Dem. That lane's no thoroughfare. Syrus. Ay, very true: No more it is, Sir.âWhat a fool I am! I was mistaken.âYou must go quite back Into the Portico; and after all, This is the nearest and the safest way. âD'ye know Cratinus' house? the rich man? Dem. Ay. Syrus. It is observed by Theobald in his edition of Shakespeare, that the perplext direction given by Lancelot seems to be copied from this of Syrus. âTurn up, on your right hand at the next turning, but, at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next turning of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house.â Merchant of Venice.When you've pass'd that, turn short upon the left. Keep strait along that street, and when you reach Diana's Temple, turn upon the right. And then, on this side of the city-gate, This gives us to understand that Demea would be sent quite to the further part of the town.âThe pond also is naturally mentioned, for Varro tells us that near the gate was always a large pond, to water the horses, and supply the inhabitants in case of fire. Donatus. Just by the pond, there is a baker's shop, And opposite a joiner's.âThere he is. Dem. What business has he there? Syrus. He has bespoke Some tables to be made with oaken legs It was usual with the GrÃ¦cians to sit and drink in the sun. Syrus therefore being asked a sudden question, is supposed to have sufficient presence of mind to give this circumstantial answer, that he might the better impose on Demea. Donatus. To stand the sun. Dem. For you to drink upon. Oh brave!âBut I lose time. I'll after him. [Exit hastily. SCENE III. SYRUS alone. Ay, go your ways! I'll work your old shrunk shanks As you deserve, old Drybones!âÃschinus Loiters intolerably. Dinner's spoil'd. The Greeks and the Romans generally had but one repast a day, which was their supper. The dinner here mentioned was therefore an instance of luxury and debauch. Dacier. Ctesipho thinks of nothing but his girl. 'Tis time for me to look to myself too. Faith, then I'll in immediately; pick out All the tid-bits, and tossing off my cups, In lazy leisure lengthen out the day. [Exit. SCENE IV. Enter MICIO, and HEGIO. Micio. I can see nothing in this matter, Hegio, Wherein I merit so much commendation. 'Tis but my duty, to redress the wrongs, That we have caus'd: unless perhaps you took me For one of those, who, having injur'd you, Term fair expostulation an affront; And having first offended, are the first To turn accusers.âI've not acted thus: And is't for this that I am thank'd? Hegio. Ah, no; I never thought you other than you are. But let me beg you, Micio, go with me To the young woman's mother, and repeat Yourself to Her what you have just told Me: âThat the suspicion, fall'n on Ãschinus, Sprung from his brother and the Musick-Girl. Micio. If you believe I ought, or think it needful, Let's go! Hegio. 'Tis very kind in you: for thus You'll raise her spirit drooping with the load Of grief and misery, and have perform'd Ev'ry good office of benevolence. But if you like it not, I'll go myself, And tell her the whole story. Micio. No, I'll go. Hegio. 'Tis good and tender in your nature, Micio. This fine sentiment is supposed to be built on the following lines of Menander. If so, I think our poet has improved on his original. ???? ?????? ?????? ? ????? ???? ????????, ??? ?????? ????? ??????????? ???????????. ? ?? ??????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????, ???????, ?????. The poor man in all things acts fearfully, Suspecting all despise him. But the man Who's more at ease, with greater constancy Bears up against misfortunes, Lamprias!For they, whose fortunes are less prosperous, Are all, I know not how, the more suspicious; And think themselves neglected and contemn'd, Because of their distress and poverty. Wherefore I think 'twould satisfy them more, If you would clear up this affair yourself. Micio. What you have said is just, and very true. Hegio. Let me conduct you in! Micio. With all my heart. [Exeunt. SCENE V. ÃSCHINUS alone. Oh torture to my mind! that this misfortune Should come thus unexpectedly upon me! I know not what to do, which way to turn. Fear shakes my limbs, amazement fills my soul, And in my breast despair shuts out all counsel. Ah, by what means can I acquit myself? Such a suspicion is now fallen on me; And that so grounded on appearances. Sostrata thinks that on my own account I bought the Musick-Girl. That's plain enough From the old nurse. For meeting her by chance, As she was sent from hence to call a midwife, I ran, and ask'd her of my Pamphila. ââIs she in labour? are you going now âTo call a midwife?âââGo, go, Ãschinus! âAway, you have deceiv'd us long enough, âFool'd us enough with your fine promises,â Cried she.ââWhat now?â says I.ââFarewel, enjoy âThe girl that you're so taken with!ââI saw Immediately their cause of jealousy: Yet I contain'd myself, nor would disclose My brother's business to a tattling gossip, By whom the knowledge on't might be betray'd. âBut what shall I do now? shall I confess The girl to be my brother's; an affair Which should by no means be reveal'd?âBut not To dwell on that.âPerhaps they'd not disclose it: Nay I much doubt if they would credit it: So many proofs concur against Myself.â I bore her off; I paid the money down; She was brought home to Me.âAll this, I own, Is my own fault. For should I not have told My father, be it as it might, the whole? I shou'd, I doubt not, have obtain'd his leave To marry Pamphila.âWhat indolence, Ev'n till this hour! now, Ãschinus, awake! âBut first I'll go, and clear myself to Them. I'll to the door. [goes up.]âConfusion! how I tremble! How guilty like I seem, when I approach This house! [knocks.] Hola! within! 'Tis L; 'Tis Ãschinus. Come, open somebody The door immediately!âWho's here? A stranger! I'll step aside. [retires. SCENE VI. Enter MICIO. Micio, to Sostrata within.] Do as I've told you, Sostrata. I'll find out Ãschinus, and tell him all. âBut who knock'd at the door? [coming forward. Ãsch. behind.] By heav'n, my father! Confusion! Micio, seeing him.] Ãschinus! Ãsch. What does he here? [aside. Micio. Was't you that knock'd?âWhat, not a word! I banter him a little. He deserves it, [Suppose For never trusting this affair to me. [aside. âWhy don't you speak? Ãsch. Not I, as I remember. [disorder'd. Micio. No, I dare say, not you: for I was wond'ring What business could have brought you here.âHe blushes. All's safe, I find. [aside. Ãsch. recovering.] But prithee, tell me, Sir, What brought you here? Micio. No business of my own. But a friend drew me hither from the Forum, To be his advocate. Ãsch. In what? Micio. I'll tell you. This house is tenanted by some poor women, Whom, I believe, you know not;âNay, I'm sure on't, For 'twas but lately they came over hither. Ãsch. Well? Micio. A young woman and her mother. Ãsch. Well? Micio. The father's dead.âThis friend of mine, it seems, Being her next relation, by the law Is forc'd to marry her. This appears in many instances to have been a law in force with the Athenians, and was probably handed down to them by the PhÅnicians, who originally received it from the Jews. And every daughter that possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers. Numbers, Chap. xxxvi. v. 8. Dacier. Ãsch. Confusion! [aside. Micio. How? Ãsch. Nothing.âWell?âpray go on, Sir!â Micio. He's now come To take her home, for he is of Miletus. A colony of the Athenians in Pontus. Donatus. Ãsch. How! take her home with him? Micio. Yes, take her home. Ãsch. What! to Miletus? Micio. Ay. Ãsch. Oh torture! [aside]âWell? What say the women? Micio. Why, what shou'd they? Nothing. Indeed the mother has devis'd a tale About her daughter's having had a child By some one else, but never mentions whom: His claim, she says, is prior; and my friend Ought not to have her. Ãsch. Well? and did not this Seem a sufficient reason? Micio. No. Ãsch. No, Sir? And shall this next relation take her off? Micio. Ay, to be sure: why not? Ãsch. Oh barbarous, cruel! Andâto speak plainly, Sir,âungenerous! Micio. Why so? Ãsch. Why so, Sir?âWhat d'ye think Will come of Him, the poor unhappy youth Who was connected with her first;âwho still Loves her, perhaps, as dearly as his life;â When he shall see her torn out of his arms, And born away for ever?âOh shame, shame! Micio. Where is the shame on't?â These questions, which enumerate all the proofs requisite to a marriage, are an indirect, and very delicate reproof of Ãschinus for the irregular and clandestine manner in which he had conducted this affair. Donatus. Who betroth'd, who gave her? When was she married? and to whom? Where is he, And wherefore did he wed another's right? Ãsch. Was it for Her, a girl of such an age, To sit at home, expecting till a kinsman Came, nobody knows whence, to marry her? âThis, Sir, it was your business to have said, And to have dwelt on it. Micio. Ridiculous! Should I have pleaded against Him, to whom I came an advocate?âBut after all, What's this affair to Us? or, what have we To do with them? let's go!âHa! why those tears? Ãsch. Father, beseech you, hear me! Micio. Ãschinus, I have heard all, and I know all, already: For I do love you; wherefore all your actions Touch me the more. Ãsch. So may you ever love me, And so may I deserve your love, my father, As I am sorry to have done this fault, And am asham'd to see you! Micio. I believe it; For well I know you have a liberal mind: But I'm afraid you are too negligent. For in what city do you think you live? You have abus'd a virgin, whom the law Forbad your touching.â'Twas a fault, a great one; But yet a natural failing. Many others, Some not bad men, have often done the same. âBut after this event, can you pretend You took the least precaution? or consider'd What shou'd be done, or how?âIf shame forbad Your telling me Yourself, you shou'd have found Some other means to let me know of it. Lost in these doubts, ten months have slipt away. You have betray'd, as far as in you lay, Yourself, the poor young woman, and your child. What! did you think the Gods wou'd bring about This business in your sleep; and that your wife, Without your stir, would be convey'd to you Into your bed-chamber?âI wou'd not have you Thus negligent in other matters.âCome, Cheer up, son! you shall wed her. Ãsch. How! Micio. Cheer up, I say! Ãsch. Nay, prithee, do not mock me, father! Micio. Mock you? I? wherefore? We may very innocently banter a friend, and frighten him with false alarms, when it is in our power to undeceive him immediately, and to surprise him with good news. But none but an enemy would buoy one up with false hopes, in order to dash them with bitterness and trouble. Micio therefore discovers a benevolent emotion at even being supposed to trifle with him in this respect. Donatus. Ãsch. I don't know; unless That I so much desire it may be true, I therefore fear it more. Micio. âAway; go home; And pray the Gods, that you may call your wife. Away! Ãsch. How's that? my wife? what! now? Micio. Now. Ãsch. Now? Micio. Ev'n now, as soon as possible. Ãsch. May all The Gods desert me, Sir, but I do love you, More than my eyes! Micio. Than her? Ãsch. As well. Micio. That's much. Ãsch. But where is that Milesian? Micio. Gone: Vanish'd: on board the ship.âBut why d'ye loiter? Ãsch. Ah, Sir, you rather go, and pray the Gods; For, being a much better man than I, They will the sooner hear your pray'rs. Donatus observes that there is great delicacy in this compliment of Ãschinus to Micio, which, though made to his face, does not carry in it the least appearance of flattery. Madam Dacier imagines Terence refers here to a line in Hesiod, which says that it is the business of old men to pray. I should rather imagine our author had an eye to the following fine lines of Menander, which have already been recommended to the publick notice by the learned critick in the Adventurer, No. 105. ????? ?? ?????? ?????????, ? ???????, ?????? ?? ?????? ? ??????, ?, ?? ???, ?????? ????????, ? ?????????????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ???? ????????, ? ??? ?????????, ? ????????? ?????, ?????? ??????? ??? ???? ?????????, ??????? ???????, ??? ?????? ?????? ????. ??? ??? ??? ????? ???????? ?????????, ?? ????????? ?????????, ?? ??????????, ????????? ??? ????????? ???????? ?????. ???? ??????? ?????? ????????, ???????, ? ??? ???? ?????? ?? ??????? ?????. The man who sacrifices, Pamphilus, A multitude of bulls, or goats, or sheep; Or prepares golden vestments, purple raiment, Figures of ivory, or precious gems; Thinking to render God propitious to him, Most grosly errs, and bears an empty mind. Let him be good and charitable rather, No doer of uncleanness, no corrupter Of virgin innocence, no murd'rer, robber, In quest of gain. Covet not, Pamphilus, This seems to have been a proverbial expression, as we find it occur in another fragment of Menander.Even a needleful of thread, for God, Who's always near thee, always sees thy deeds. Micio. I'll in, To see the needful preparations made. You, if you're wise, do as I said. [Exit. SCENE VII. ÃSCHINUS alone. How's this? Is this to be a father? Or is this To be a son?âWere he my friend or brother, Could he be more complacent to my wish? Should I not love him? bear him in my bosom? Ah! his great kindness has so wrought upon me, That it shall be the study of my life To shun all follies, Donatus justly observes, that it is plain from this soliloquy, that Terence takes the part of mild fathers, meaning to shew that gentle reproofs, mingled with tenderness, will have more effect on an ingenuous mind than railing and severity. That critick also is more minute than usual in pointing out the great beauties of the foregoing scene; commenting on almost every speech, and observing how finely the two characters of Micio and Ãschinus are sustained throughout their whole conversation. It was impossible to lay before the English reader all the little particularities dwelt upon by Donatus: and indeed the reader must have very little sensibility, who cannot of himself discern, even through the medium of this translation, the many amiable touches of good-humour, mildness, and affection that distinguish Micio's character, as well as the natural strokes of passion, and ingenuous shame in Ãschinus. The whole scene is remarkably beautiful, and perhaps more characteristick of the genius of Terence than any other in his works. lest they give him pain. âBut I'll in strait, that I may not retard My marriage by my own delay. [Exit. SCENE VIII. DEMEA alone. I'm tir'd With walking.âNow great Jove confound you, Syrus; You and your blind directions! I have crawl'd All the town over: to the gate; the pond; Where not? No sign of any shop was there, Nor any person who had seen my brother. âNow I'll in therefore and set up my rest In his own house, till he comes home again. [going. SCENE IX. Enter MICIO. Micio. I'll go and let the women know we're ready. Dem. But here he is.âI have long sought you, Micio. Micio. What now? Dem. I bring you more offences; great ones; Of that sweet youthâ Micio. See there! Dem. New; capital! Micio. Nay, nay, no more! Dem. Ah, you don't knowâ Micio. I do. Dem. O fool, you think I mean the Musick-Girl. This is a rape upon a citizen. Micio. I know it. Dem. How? d'ye know it, and endure it? Micio. Why not endure it? Dem. Tell me, don't you rave? Don't you go mad? Micio. No; to be sure I'd ratherâ Dem. There's a child born. Micio. Heav'n bless it! Dem. And the girl Has nothing. Micio. I have heard so. Dem. And is He To marry her without a fortune? Micio. Ay. Dem. What's to be done then? Micio. What the case requires. The girl shall be brought over here. Dem. Oh Jove! Can that be proper? Micio. What can I do else? Dem. What can you do?âIf you're not really griev'd, It were at least your duty to appear so. Micio. I have contracted the young woman to him: The thing is settled: 'tis their wedding-day: And all their apprehensions I've remov'd. This is still more my duty. Dem. Are you pleas'd then With this adventure, Micio? Micio. Not at all, If I could help it: now 'tis past all cure, I bear it patiently. The life of man Menander might possibly borrow this moral maxim from a passage in the tenth book of Plato's Republick, where it is said, âThat we should take counsel from accidents, and, as in a game at dice, act according to what has fallen, in that manner which reason directs us to be the best.â Dacier. Is like a game at tables. If the cast Which is most necessary, be not thrown, That, which chance sends, you must correct by art. Dem. Oh rare Corrector!âBy your art no less Than Twenty MinÃ¦ have been thrown away On yonder Musick-Wench; who, out of hand, Must be sent packing; if no buyer, gratis. Micio. Not in the least; nor do I mean to sell her. Micio is here involved in a ridiculous dilemma, in which he had rather appear absurd, than betray Ctesipho. Donatus. Dem. What will you do then! Micio. Keep her in my house. Dem. Oh heav'n and earth! a harlot and a wife In the same house! Micio. Why not? Dem. Have you your wits? Micio. Truly I think so. Dem. Now, so help me heav'n, Seeing your folly, I believe you keep her To sing with you. Micio. Why not? Dem. And the young bride Shall be her pupil? Micio. To be sure. Dem. And you Dance hand in hand with them? Restim ductans saltabis. Restim ducere; literally, to lead the cord: which would induce one to imagine that when many persons were dancing together in those days, they held a cordâbut why a cord? might they not as well take hold of each other's hands? I am persuaded that they did, and agree with Donatus that the expression is merely metaphorical. Dacier. Micio. Ay. Dem. Ay? Micio. And you Make one amongst us too upon occasion. Dem. Ah! are you not asham'd on't? Micio. Patience, Demea! Lay by your wrath, and seem, as it becomes you, Chearful and free of heart at your son's wedding. âI'll but speak with the bride and Sostrata, And then return to you immediately. [Exit. SCENE X. DEMEA alone. Jove, what a life! what manners! what distraction! A Bride just coming home without a portion; A Musick-Girl already there in keeping; A house of waste; the youth, a libertine; Th'old man, a dotard!â'Tis not in the pow'r Of Providence herself, howe'er desirous, To save from ruin such a family. SCENE XI. Enter at a distance SYRUS drunk. Syrus, to himself.] Faith, little Syrus, you've ta'en special care Of your sweet self, and play'd your part most rarely. âWell, go your ways:âbut having had my fill Of ev'ry thing within, I've now march'd forth To take a turn or two abroad. Dem. behind.] Look there! A pattern of instruction! Syrus, seeing him.] But see there: Yonder's old Demea. [going up to him.] What's the matter now? And why so melancholy? Dem. Oh thou villain! Syrus. What! are you spouting sentences, old Wisdom? Dem. Were you my servantâ Syrus. You'd be plaguy rich, And settle your affairs most wonderfully. Dem. I'd make you an example. Syrus. Why? for what? Dem. Why, sirrah?â The gravity of Demea and drunkenness of Syrus create a very humourous contrast, and are admirably calculated to excite mirth in the spectators. Donatus. In the midst of this disturbance, And in the heat of a most heavy crime, While all is yet confusion, you've got drunk, As if for joy, you rascal! Syrus. Why the plague Did not I keep within? [aside. SCENE XII. Enter DROMO hastily. Dromo. Here! hark ye, Syrus! Ctesipho begs that you'd come back. Syrus. Away! [pushing him off. Dem. What's this he says of Ctesipho? Syrus. Pshaw! nothing. Dem. How, dog, is Ctesipho within? Syrus. Not he. Dem. Why does he name him then? Syrus. It is another Of the same nameâa little parasiteâ D'ye know him? Dem. But I will immediately. [going. Syrus, stopping him.] What now? where now? Dem. Let me alone. (struggling.) Syrus. Don't go! (struggling.) Dem. Hands off! what won't you? must I brain you, rascal? [disengages himself from Syrus, and Exit. SCENE XIII. SYRUS alone. He's goneâgone inâand faith no welcome roarerâ Comissatorem haud sane commodum. The chief beauty lies in the word Comissator, which signified one who came to join a jovial party, bursting in upon them unexpectedly with much noise and clamour. Donatus. Dacier. âEspecially to Ctesipho.âBut what Can I do now; unless till this blows over, I sneak into some corner, and sleep off This wine that lies upon my head?âI'll do't. [Exit reeling. SCENE XIV. Enter MICIO from Sostrata. Micio, to Sostrata within.] All is prepar'd: and we are ready, Sostrata, As I've already told you, when you please. [comes forward. But who's this I forgot to observe before, that in Athens the street-doors were made to open outwards; so that when any one was coming out, the noise of the door (which is often mentioned in these comedies) served to give notice to those in the street, that they might escape being hurt, and make way for the opening of the door. Dacier. forces open our street-door With so much violence? Enter DEMEA on t'other side. Dem. Confusion! death! What shall I do? or how resolve? where vent My cries and exclamations?âHeav'n! Earth! Sea! Micio, behind.] So! all's discover'd: that's the thing he raves at. âNow for a quarrel!â The character of Micio appears extremely amiable through the four first acts of this comedy, and his behaviour is in many respects worthy imitation. But his conduct in conniving at the irregularities of Ctesipho, and even assisting him to support them, is certainly reprehensible. Perhaps the Poet threw this shade over his virtues, on purpose to shew that mildness and good-humour might be carried to an excess. I must help the boy. Dem. seeing him.] Oh, there's the grand corrupter of our children! Micio. Appease your wrath, and be yourself again! Dem. Well, I've appeas'd it; I'm myself again; I spare reproaches; let us to the point! It was agreed between us, and it was Your own proposal too, that you shou'd never Concern yourself with Ctesipho, nor I With Ãschinus. Say, was't not so? Micio. It was: I don't deny it. Dem. Why does Ctesipho Revel with you then? Why do you receive him? Buy him a mistress, Micio?âIs not justice My due from you, as well as your's from me? Since I do not concern myself with your's, Meddle not you with mine! Micio. This is not fair; Indeed it is not. Think on the old saying, âAll things are common among friends.â Dem. How smart! Put off with quips and sentences at last? Micio. Nay, hear me, if you can have patience, Demea. âFirst, if you're griev'd at their extravagance, Let this reflexion calm you! Formerly, You bred them both according to your fortune, Supposing it sufficient for them both: Then too you thought that I shou'd take a wife. Still follow the old rule you then laid down: Hoard, scrape, and save; do ev'ry thing you can To leave them nobly! Be that glory your's. My fortune, fall'n beyond their hopes upon them, Let them use freely! As your capital Will not be wasted, what addition comes From mine, consider as clear gain: and thus, Weighing all this impartially, you'll spare Yourself, and me, and them, a world of trouble. Dem. Money is not the thing: their moralsâ Micio. Hold! I understand; and meant to speak of that. Madam Dacier makes an observation on this speech something like that of Donatus on one of Micio's above; and says that Micio, being hard put to it by the real circumstances of the case, thinks to confound Demea by a nonsensical galimatia. I cannot be of the ingenious lady's opinion in this matter: for I think a more sensible speech could not be made, nor a better plea offered in favour of the young men, than that of Micio in the present instance.There are in nature sundry marks, good Demea, By which you may conjecture easily, That when two persons do the self-same thing, It oftentimes falls out, that in the one 'Tis criminal, in t'other 'tis not so: Not that the thing itself is different, But he who does it.âIn these youths I see The marks of virtue; and, I trust, they'll prove Such as we wish them. They have sense, I know; Attention; in its season, liberal shame; And fondness for each other; all sure signs Of an ingenuous mind and noble nature: And tho' they stray, you may at any time Reclaim them.âBut perhaps you fear, they'll prove Too inattentive to their interest. Oh my dear Demea, in all matters else Increase of years increases wisdom in us: This only vice age brings along with it; âWe're all more worldly-minded, than there's need:â Which passion age, that kills all passions else, Will ripen in your sons too. Dem. Have a care That these fine arguments, and this great mildness Don't prove the ruin of us, Micio! Micio. Peace! It shall not be: away with all your fears! This day be rul'd by me: come, smooth your brow. Dem. Well, since at present things are so, I must. But then I'll to the country with my son To-morrow, at first peep of day. Micio. At midnight, So you'll but smile to-day. Dem. And that wench too I'll drag away with me. Micio. Ay; there you've hit it. For by that means you'll keep your son at home; Do but secure her. Dem. I'll see that: for there I'll put her in the kitchen and the mill, And make her full of ashes, smoak, and meal: Nay at high noon too she shall gather stubble. I'll burn her up, and make her black as coal. Micio. Right! now you're wise.âAnd then I'd make my son Go to bed to her, tho' against his will. Dem. D'ye laugh at me? how happy in your temper! I feelâ Micio. Ah! that again? Dem. I've done. Micio. In then! And let us suit our humour to the time. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. This scene, which I have placed the first of the fifth act, stands in Madam Dacier's translation, and in all those editions and translations who have followed her, as the second. I think it is plain from the end of the foregoing scene, that Micio and Demea quitted the stage, and entered the house together; and it seems to be equally evident, from the message that Syrus brings to Demea in the scene immediately succeeding this, that Demea had left the company withinâRogat frater, ne abeas longiusâyour brother begs, you'd not go further off. But what had still more weight with me, and was a more forcible motive to induce me to begin the fifth act with this soliloquy, was the propriety, and indeed necessity of an interval in this place. The total change of character, whether real or affected, is in itself so extraordinary, that it required all the art of Terence to bring it about; and the only probable method of effecting it, is to suppose it the result at least of some little deliberation, and reflexion on the inconveniencies he had experienced from a contrary temper. Donatus observes the great art with which Terence has preserved the gradation of Demea's anger and distresses, which can be pushed no further than the discovery of Ctesipho; and this admirable climax of incidents, if I may hazard the expression, is finely completed in the scene with which I have closed the fourth act. To say the truth, the fable itself in a manner ends there; and though there is much humour and pleasantry in the remaining part of the play, yet many good criticks have objected to it. Terence however, or rather Menander, must be allowed to have shewn an uncommon effort of genius, if not of judgment, in these adscititious scenes, which he has founded on the conversion of Demea: a circumstance which grows out of the foregoing incidents, and supplies the materials for a pleasant fifth act, like the Giving away the Rings in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, in which play also, as well as this of Terence, the main business of the plot is concluded in the fourth act. DEMEA alone. Never did man lay down so fair a plan, So wife a rule of life, but fortune, age, Or long experience made some change in it; And taught him, that those things he thought he knew, He did not know, and what he held as best, In practice he threw by. The very thing That happens to myself. For that hard life Which I have ever led, my race near run, Now in the last stage, I renounce: and why? But that by dear experience I've been told, There's nothing so advantages a man, As mildness and complacency. Of this My brother and myself are living proofs: He always led an easy, chearful life; Good-humour'd, mild, offending nobody, Smiling on all; a jovial batchelor, His whole expences center'd in himself. I, on the contrary, rough, rigid, cross, Saving, morose, and thrifty, took a wife: âWhat miseries did marriage bring!âhad children; âA new uneasiness!âand then besides, Striving all ways to make a fortune for them, I have worn out my prime of life and health: And now, my course near finish'd, what return Do I receive for all my toil? Their hate. Meanwhile my brother, without any care, Reaps all a father's comforts. Him they love, Me they avoid: to him they open all Their secret counsels; doat on him; and both Repair to him; while I am quite forsaken. His life they pray for, but expect my death. Thus those, brought up by my exceeding labour, He, at a small expence, has made his own: The care all mine, and all the pleasure his. âWell then, let Me endeavour in my turn To teach my tongue civility, to give With open-handed generosity, Since I am challeng'd to't!âand let Me too Obtain the love and reverence of my children! And if 'tis bought by bounty and indulgence, I will not be behind-hand.âCash will fail: What's that to me, who am the eldest-born? SCENE II. Enter SYRUS. Syrus. Oh Sir! your brother has dispatch'd me to you To beg you'd not go further off. Dem. Who's there?â Here the Poet shews how aukwardly a man of an opposite disposition endeavours to be complaisant; and that a miser, meaning to be generous, runs into profusion. Donatus.What, honest Syrus! save you: how is't with you? How goes it? Syrus. Very well, Sir. Demea, aside.] Excellent! Now for the first time I, against my nature, Have added these three phrases, âHonest Syrus! âHow is't?âHow goes it?ââ[to Syrus.] You have prov'd yourself A worthy servant. I'll reward you for it. Syrus. I thank you, Sir. Dem. I will, I promise you; And you shall be convinc'd on't very soon. SCENE III. Enter GETA. Geta, to Sostrata within.] Madam, I'm going to look after them, That they may call the bride immediately. âBut here is Demea. Save you! Dem. Oh! your name? Geta. Geta, Sir. Dem. Geta, I this day have found you To be a fellow of uncommon worth: For sure that servant's faith is well approv'd Who holds his master's interest at heart, As I perceiv'd that you did, Geta! wherefore, Soon as occasion offers, I'll reward you. âI am endeavouring to be affable, And not without success. [aside. Geta. 'Tis kind in you To think of your poor slave, Sir. Dem. aside.] First of all I court the mob, and win them by degrees. SCENE IV. Enter ÃSCHINUS. Ãsch. They murder me with their delays; and while They lavish all this pomp upon the nuptials, They waste the live-long day in preparation. Dem. How does my son? Ãsch. My father! Are you here? Dem. Ay, by affection, and by blood your father, Who love you better than my eyes.âBut why Do you not call the bride? Ãsch. 'Tis what I long for: But wait the musick and the singers. Dem. Pshaw! Will you for once be rul'd by an old fellow? Ãsch. Well? Dem. The bride was usually thus attended, and Lucian speaks of this retinue, and I believe took the passage from Menander, where he says, ??? ??????????, ??? ???????, ??? ???????? ??????? ?????, &amp;c. âthe players on the flute, the company, and singers of the nuptial song.â Dacier.Ne'er mind singers, company, lights, musick; But tell them to throw down the garden-wall, As soon as possible. Convey the bride That way, and lay both houses into one. Bring too the mother, and whole family, Over to us. Ãsch. I will. Oh charming father! Dem. aside.] Charming! See there! He calls me charming now. âMy brother's house will be a thorough-fare; Throng'd with whole crouds of people; much expence Will follow; very much: what's that to me? I am call'd charming, and get into favour. âHo! order Babylo immediately Jube nunc jam dinumeret illi Babylo viginti minas. All the commentators and translators have been extremely puzzled at this passage. It does not become the last comer to be positive, where so many conjectures have already been offered and rejected. But if one may determine from the context, which is commonly the best way as well as the most natural and obvious, it should seem that Demea means to give an order to one of his servants to give Ãschinus Twenty MinÃ¦. He has already determined to be very generous, and another instance of his bounty occurs in the last scene, where he pays down the money for the freedom of Phrygia.âIn this very speech he is pleasantly considering within himself the expence, which he disregards so as he can but get into favour. In consequence of which resolution it is natural to suppose that he immediately gives an order for issuing money to defray the charges of pulling down walls, entertaining company, &amp;c. To pay him Twenty MinÃ¦.âPrithee, Syrus, Why don't you execute your orders? Syrus. What? Dem. Down with the wall!â[Exit Syrus.]âYou Geta, go, and bring The ladies over. Geta. Heaven bless you, Demea, For all your friendship to our family! [Exit Geta. Dem. They're worthy of it.âWhat say You to this? [to Ãsch. Ãsch. I think it admirable. Dem. 'Tis much better, Than for a poor soul, sick, and lying-in, To be conducted thro' the street. Ãsch. I never Saw any thing concerted better, Sir. Dem. 'Tis just my way.âBut here comes Micio. SCENE V. Enter MICIO. Micio, at entering.] My brother order it, d'ye say? where is he? âWas this your order, Demea? Dem. 'Twas my order; And by this means, and every other way, I would unite, serve, cherish, and oblige, And join the family to our's! Ãsch. Pray do, Sir! [to Micio. Micio. I don't oppose it. Dem. Nay, but 'tis our duty. First, there's the mother of the brideâ Micio. What then? Dem. Worthy and modest. Micio. So they say. Dem. In years. Micio. True. Dem. And so far advanc'd, that she is long Past child-bearing, a poor lone woman too, With none to comfort her. Micio. What means all this? Dem. This woman 'tis your place to marry, brother; âAnd your's [to Ãsch.] to bring him to't. Micio. I marry her? Dem. You. Micio. I? Dem. Yes, you I say. Micio. Ridiculous! Dem. to Ãsch.] If you're a man, he'll do't. Ãsch. to Micio.] Dear father! Micio. How! Do you then join him, fool? Dem. Nay, don't deny. It can't be otherwise. Micio. You've lost your senses! Ãsch. Let me prevail upon you, Sir! Micio. You're mad. Away! Dem. Oblige your son. Micio. Have you your wits? I a new-married man at sixty-five! And marry a decrepid poor old woman! Is that what you advise me? Ãsch. Do it, Sir! I've promis'd them. Micio. You've promis'd them indeed! Prithee, boy, promise for yourself. Dem. Come, come! What if he ask'd still more of you? Micio. As if This was not ev'n the utmost. Dem. Nay, comply! Ãsch. Be not obdurate! Dem. Come, come, promise him. Micio. Won't you desist? Ãsch. No, not till I prevail. Micio. This is mere force. Dem. Nay, nay, comply, good Micio! Micio. Tho' this appears to me absurd, wrong, foolish, And quite repugnant to my scheme of life, Yet, if you're so much bent on't, let it be! Ãsch. Obliging indeed! The Poet's conduct here is justly liable to censure: the only consideration that can be urged in his defence is, that he meant to shew the inconveniencies arising from too unbounded a good-nature. But Micio has all along been represented so agreeable, and possessed of so much judgment, good sense, and knowledge of the world, that this last piece of extravagance must shock probability, and offend the delicacy of the spectator. Patrick. Apud Menandrum senex de nuptiis non gravatur. Ergo Terentius ?????????. Donatus. It is surprising that none of the criticks on this passage have taken notice of this observation of Donatus, especially as our loss of Menander makes it rather curious. It is plain that Terence in the plan of this last act followed Menander: and in the present circumstance though he has adopted the absurdity of marrying Micio to the old lady, yet we learn from Donatus that he rather improved on his original by making Micio express a repugnance to suchâa match, which it seems he did not in the play of Menander.Obliging father, worthy my best love!

He has been Father to Her; a good man; our relation. It will be given worthily. In short, That saying, Micio, I now make my own, Which you so lately and so wisely quoted; âIt is the common failing of old men, âTo be too much intent on worldly matters.â Let us wipe off that stain. The saying's true, And should be practis'd. Micio. Well, well; be it so, If he requires it. [pointing to Ãsch. Ãsch. I beseech it, father. Dem. Now you're indeed my brother, soul and body. Micio.

I've taken care of both your sons from boys; Taught them, instructed them, and given them The wholesomest advice, that I was able. Dem. The thing's apparent: and these offices, To cater;âbring a wench in, safe and snug; âOr Apparare de die convivium. The force of this passage consists in the words de die, because, as has been observed in another place, the chief meal of the GrÃ¦cians was at supper, and an entertainment in the day-time was considered as a debauch. Dacier. in mid-day prepare an entertainment;â âAll these are talents of no common man. Syrus. Oh most delightful gentleman! Dem. Besides, He has been instrumental too this day In purchasing the Musick-Girl. He manag'd The whole affair. We shou'd reward him for it. It will encourage others. The grave irony of this passage is extremely humourous. Donatus.âIn a word, Your Ãschinus would have it so. Micio. Do you Desire it? Ãsch. Yes, Sir. Micio. Well if you desire itâ Come hither, Syrus!âBe thou free! [Syrus kneels; Micio strikes him, being the ceremony of manumission, or giving a Slave his freedom.] Syrus. I thank you: Thanks to you all; but most of all, to Demea! Dem. I'm glad of your good fortune. Ãsch. So am I. Syrus. I do believe it; and I wish this joy Were quite complete, and I might see my wife, My Phrygia too, made free as well as I. Dem. The very best of women! Syrus.

What means this? Whence comes this hasty change of manners, Brother? Quad proluvium? quÃ¦ istÃ¦c subita est largitas? A passage borrowed from the comick poet CÃ¦cilius. Dacier.Whence flows all this extravagance? and whence This sudden prodigality? Dem. I'll tell you: I would have characters separated from each other; but I must own that a direct contrast displeases me. But the most sure method to spoil a play, and to render it quite insupportable, would be to multiply such contrasts. See what would be the result of these antitheses. I call them Antitheses; for the contrast of character is, in the plan of the drama, what that figure is in conversation. It is happy; but it must be used with moderation; and in an elevated stile, totally excluded. What is the most common state of society, that where characters are contrasted, or where they are only different? What is the intention of contrast in character? Doubtless to render one of the two more striking. But that effect can only be obtained, where they both appear together. What a monotony will this create in the dialogue? what a constraint will it impose on the conduct of the fable? How can I attend to the natural chain of events, and proper succession of scenes, if I am engaged by the necessity of always bringing the two opposite characters together? How often will it happen that the contrast will require one scene, and the true course of the fable another? Besides, if the two contrasted characters are both drawn with equal force, the intention of the drama will be rendered equivocal. To conceive the whole force of this reasoning, open the Brothers of Terence. There you will see two brothers contrasted, both drawn with equal force; and you may challenge the most subtle critick to tell you which is the principal character, Micio or Demea? If he ventures to pronounce before the last scene, he will find to his astonishment, that He, whom he has taken, during five acts, for a man of sense, is a fool; and that He, whom he has taken for a fool, may be a very sensible man. One would suppose at the beginning of the fifth act, that the Author, embarrassed by the contrast which he had established, was obliged to abandon his design, and to turn the interest of his piece topsy-turvy. But what is the consequence? That we no longer know which side to take; and after having been all along for Micio against Demea, we conclude without knowing, whether we are for one, or the other. One would almost desire a third father to preserve the golden mean between the two characters, and to point out the faults of each of them. Diderot. Here Demea returns to his own character, and the conduct of Terence is admirable in the lesson given to Micio. The opposite characters of these two brothers, and the inconveniencies resulting from each, perfectly point out to fathers the middle way which they ought to persue in the education of their children, between the too great severity of the one, and the unlimited indulgence of the other. Dacier.To shew you, that the reason, why our sons Think you so pleasant and agreeable, Is not from your deserts, or truth, or justice, But your compliance, bounty, and indulgence. âNow, therefore, if I'm odious to you, son, Because I'm not subservient to your humour, In all things, right, or wrong; away with care! Spend, squander, and do what you will!âBut if, In those affairs where youth has made you blind, Eager, and thoughtless, you will suffer me To counsel and correctâand in due season Indulge youâI am at your service. Ãsch. Father, In all things we submit ourselves to you. What's fit and proper, you know best.âBut what Shall come of my poor brother? Dem. This complaisance of Demea in allowing Ctesipho to retain the Musick-Girl, would be very criminal in a modern father; but the Greeks and Romans were not sufficiently enlightened to be sensible of the sin. Dacier.I consent That he shall have her: let him finish there. Ãsch. It has been said that l'Ecole des Maris [The School for Husbands] was a copy of the Brothers of Terence: if so, Moliere deserves more praise for having brought the taste of ancient Rome into France, than reproach for having stolen his piece. But the Brothers furnished nothing more than the bare idea of the Ecole des Maris. There are in the Brothers two old men of opposite humours, who give each of them a different education to the children that they educate; there are in like manner in the Ecole des Maris two guardians, of which one is severe, and the other indulgent; there lies the whole resemblance. There is scarce any intrigue in the Brothers; that of the Ecole des Maris is delicate, interesting, and comick. One of the women in Terence's piece, who ought to be the principal character, is never seen or heard except in her lying-in. The Isabella of Moliere is almost for ever on the stage full of grace and spirit, and sometimes mingles a decency, even in the tricks which she plays her guardian. There is no probability in the catastrophe of the Brothers: It is not in nature, that a morose, severe, covetous old fellow of sixty should become all at once gay, complaisant, and liberal. The catastrophe of the Ecole des Maris is the best of all the pieces of Moliere. It is probable, natural, grounded on the plot; and what is of full as much consequence, extremely comick. The stile of Terence is pure, sententious, but a little cold; as CÃ¦sar, who excelled in all, has reproached him. The stile of Moliere in this piece is more chaste than in any of his others. The French Author almost equals the purity of the diction of Terence; and goes far beyond him in the intrigue, the characters, the catastrophe, and humour. Voltaire's Contes de Guillaume VadÃ©. It is impossible for any reader, who is come fresh from the perusal of the Brothers of Terence, and the Ecole des Maris of Moliere to acquiesce in the above decision, and I would venture to appeal from Mons. Voltaire to any member of the French academy for a reversal of it. The reputation of Moliere has taken too deep root to be rendered more flourishing by blasting that of Terence; nor can such an attempt ever be made with a worse grace than when the imitation is blindly preferred to the original. Moliere, so far from having taken only the idea of his piece from the Brothers, has translated some passages almost literally, and the latter part of the second scene of the Ecole des Maris is a very close imitation of one in the fourth act of the Brothers. In point of fable, I make no scruple to prefer the piece of Terence to that of Moliere. The intrigue of the four first acts of the Brothers is more artfully conducted than that of any other of Terence's pieces. In the Andrian, was all the Episode of Charinus to be omitted, the play would be the better for it. In the Eunuch, as has been before observed, there is a lameness in the catastrophe, and the conclusion of Thraso's business in the last scene becomes episodical. In the Self-Tormentor the intrigue in a manner ends with the third act. In the Phormio, the loves of Antipho and PhÃ¦dria have no further relation to each other, than that Phormio is used as an engine in both. The plot of the Step-Mother, so admired by the moderns for its simplicity, shall be examined in another place. But in the play before us, the interest which Ãschinus takes in Ctesipho's affairs, combines their several amours so naturally, that they reciprocally put each other in motion. I cannot think the fable of the Ecole des Maris quite so happy. In Terence we see a good-humoured uncle adopting one of his nephews, while the other lad remains under the tuition of the severe father. This is natural enough; but in Moliere we have two young women left by their father's will as the intended wives of their antiquated guardians. Is there not some absurdity in such an idea? Micio and Demea are confessedly the archetypes of Ariste and Sganarelle; but in my mind infinitely superiour, and exhibited in a greater variety of situations: nor do the two sisters, Isabelle and Leonor, play into each others hands, like Ãschinus and Ctesipho. In the Brothers, the business and the play open together; in Moliere the first scene is a mere conversation-piece. In Moliere, the plot is thin, seems to have been only calculated for the intrigue of a petite piece, and the circumstance of Isabelle's embracing Sganarelle and giving her hand to Eraste is purely farcical. In Terence the fable is more important, and the incidents naturally unfold themselves one after another; and the manner in which Demea gradually arrives at the knowledge of them is extremely artful and comick. What then is intrigue? If it be the Dramatick Narration of a story, so laid out as to produce pleasant situations, I will not scruple to pronounce, that there is more intrigue in the Brothers than in the Ecole des Maris. The reader has already seen several strictures on the fifth act, but the particular objection made by Mons. de Voltaire to the catastrophe is founded on a mistake: the complaisance, gaiety, and liberality of Demea being merely assumed; and his aukwardness in affecting those qualities full as comick as the admired catastrophe of the Ecole des Maris; which being produced in a forced manner by the disguise of Isabelle, and the broad cheat put upon Sganarelle before his face, is certainly deficient in the probability necessary to the incidents of legitimate comedy.âIt is not without reluctance that I have been drawn into an examination of the comparative merits of these two excellent pieces: nor do I think there is in general a more invidious method of extolling one writer, than by depreciating the productions of another. Baron, the author of the Andriene, has also written a comedy called l'Ecole des PÃ©res, [the School for Fathers] built on this play of Terence. The piece opens with a very elegant, though pretty close version, of the first act of the Brothers; but on the whole I think this attempt less happy than his first. The bringing Clarice and Pamphile on the stage has no better effect, than his introduction of Glicerie in the Andrian. Telamon and AlcÃ©e are drawn with neither the strength nor delicacy of Micio and Demea; and the old man's change of character in the fifth act is neither rejected nor retained, but rather mangled and deformed. On the whole, it were to be wished, that Baron had adhered still more closely to Terence, or, like Moliere, deviated still further from him: for, as the play now stands, his attention to the Roman Poet seems to have thrown a constraint on his genius, and taken off the air of an original; while his alterations have rendered the Ecole des PÃ©res but a lame imitation, and imperfect image of the Brothers of Terence. In our own language, the Squire of Alsatia of Shadwell is also founded on this play: But the Muse of White Friars has but little right to the praises due to that of Athens and Rome. Shadwell's play, though drawn from so pure a source, is rather a farce of five acts than a comedy; nor has it the least comparative merit either in the plan or execution, except in the intention to give the character of Ctesipho more at large than it is drawn in the original.All now is as it shou'd be.â[to the audience.] Clap your hands!</field>
