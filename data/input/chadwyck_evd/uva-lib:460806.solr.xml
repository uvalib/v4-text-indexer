      <field name="fulltext">The Curtain rises, discovering the Act Drop. Enter Public Opinion. Pub. O. Who am I? One to whose supreme dominion E'en monarchs sometimes bow—Public Opinion! Therefore, I'm—what I well may boast aloud of— Your own Opinion—which, of course, you're proud of; Every one thinks his own opinion best; I'm everyone's, so never mind the rest. At once, then, to the business before us. On this occasion I enact the Chorus. There's not an urchin, in this learned age, But knows that on the old Hellenic stage The Chorus told the audience all the plot, Whether there was one in the play, or not. And explained what, with common observation, They'd understand without an explanation. But in these days of progress, I admit, Dramas there are might puzzle folks a bit. Plots which are twisted with such sleight of hand, They're things “which no fellah can understand,” As Lord Dundreary says. Our simple bard Won't give you nuts to crack so very hard; But as the piece imported is from France, Morality demands my surveillance. So let the wife who would her spouse aggrieve, Beware! And let the husband who'd deceive His better half, tremble! Don't move, sir, pray— I'm speaking of the people in the play, Not those who come to see it. Heaven forbid I should do so—and help me if I did! (bell rings) But there's the bell that bids the curtain rise, (curtain rises) And shew a Grecian landscape to your eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tableau First. —A Corn Field—The House of Orpheus, over the door a large board, on which is written: “Orpheus, Doctor of Music and Professor of Poetry. Director of the Grecian Philharmonic Society. Ladies' Schools attended. Orchestras provided for Public Balls or Private Parties”—The Cottage of Aristæus, over the door a board, on which is written: “Aristæus, Dealer in Honey, wholesale and retail. Here and at the principal manufactory, Mount Hymettus. N.B.—The Trade supplied. Honeymoons made to order at the shortest notice”—Behind the standing corn, view of a Grecian temple and the sea-shore. Enter Eurydice. Pub. O. And here advances fair Eurydice, As unlike Virgil's as she well can be; But that is not the fault of the adapter. He's ta'en the envelope in which they've wrapt her, And sticking pretty closely to the letter, Hopes he's not made her worse, if not much better. The music—heard so oft in music-halls, Where, naturally, one looks out for squalls— Will take the town by storm, his hope and trust is. No words of his, he feels, can do it justice; And flying in the face of all mythology, Not e'en Apollo could make his apolo-gy. (to Eurydice) Now, madam, without fear, approach and quaver, Public Opinion's always in your favour. I go—but not a step beyond yon wing— As “Deus ex machina,” thence to spring. (Exit) (Eurydice advances with basket of flowers) Air—Eurydice. Since Love has set my heart a-dreaming, No rest can I take; When Sol is on the hills first beaming, My couch I forsake; For 'tis then the meads and bowers All their beauty display; But for whom seek I the flowers, Must I truly say? Must I? Then mind you tell it not again— I cull them for a charming swain, Who dwells hard by. The fairest blossoms that Aurora Bespangles each morn, I gather from the lap of Flora, His porch to adorn; My poor heart, I feel, is fleeting Too quickly away: For whom it is so wildly beating Must I truly say? Must I? Then mind you tell it not again, 'Tis beating for a charming swain, Who dwells hard by. Eury. (opening door of the Cottage of Aristæus, and finding no one within) Not in! He must be somewhere here about. How sad it is to find one's lover out! Sweet flow'rets, be my witness that I came And called—alas, how vainly! on his name. My Aristæus, on the floor I strew These gifts of Flora! (flings the flowers into Cottage) Enter Orpheus, from his house. Orph. (aside) Gods! what meets my view? The lovely nymph whom I've so long adored! Alone, too. Let me touch a tender chord. (plays on his violin) Eury. My husband! Orph. (aside) Fiends! my wife! at me she'll fly out; The only way's to be the first to cry out! The injured husband I must grandly act. (aloud) So, madam, I have caught you in the fact. Eury. Caught me! In what fact, sir, I beg you'll say? Orph. To whom that floral tribute did you pay? Eury. To whom? The winds! And you, sweet spouse, explain, To whom did you address that dying strain? Orph. The moon! Eury. At sunrise? to the dear departed! All moonshine, I've no doubt—ugh! you false-hearted— Orph. Eurydice! Eury. Oh! come, no more of this! I've seen you running after every miss, Who'll listen to your scraping. Orph. Scraping—mine! Eury. You think your fiddling, don't you, mighty fine; Its execrable—there! Orph. The woman's mad! Eury. And what you call your poetry's as bad. Orph. My Argonautics that all Greece enchant! Eury. You didn't write 'em. Orph. Didn't! Eury. Couldn't—can't! Ask Aristotle. Orph. Why, the man's not born! Eury. Well, ask him when he is then. I should scorn Such mean evasions. Orph. She is quite demented! And the hexameters that I've invented? Eury. Six feet of stuff! that's just two yards of fustian. Orph. I shall expire of spontaneous combustion! Six feet—two yards! Madam, you'll please to measure Your language, and not mine. Eury. 'Tis not my pleasure. And since extremities you drive me to, I hate your verse—your violin—and you! Another sun together shall not see us— I'll be divorced, and marry Aristæus! Duo—Orpheus and Eurydice. Orph. Ah, say you so? Eury. I don't say no. Orph. You prefer him your husband to? Eury. Yes, sir, I do—it is quite true! Orph. My violin's your detestation? Eury. Exactly so! exactly so! Orph. I have no genius in your estimation? Eury. No, surely no! no, surely no! Your fiddle playing Is most distressing; A donkey braying Is not so bad! Your violin Not worth a pin; The sound's enough to drive me mad. Orph. For this offence flagitious, I'll vengeance take delicious. Eury. In what way? Tell me pray! In what way, I pray you? Orph. I now intend to play you, My dear Eurydice, My latest composition, My concerto in E. Eury. Mercy mercy! I implore Orph. No; vainly you petition. A treat you have in store; It lasts an hour and more. Eury. Oh, grant me patience! An hour or more? Not a note will I hear! Orph. Indeed you shall, my dear. (plays) Eury. It is too frightful! Of horrors quite full It is too bad! It drives me mad. Orph. It is delightful! Oh genius quite full; Expression fine, And tone divine! To this movement listen now; “Linkèd sweetness” 'tis I vow. (playing) Eury. Like a saw upon a fender! Orph. Oh, so sweet! Oh, so tender! Now tremelo—pizzicato— Presto, presto! agitato! (playing) Eury. Oh, torture past enduring; I can hear no more! Oh pity me! Love and Fate in vain conjuring To set me free! to set me free! Eury. O, Jove! relieve me from this spouse of mine, And doubly wilt thou seem to me divine. Orph. Great Jove! unwife me in a quiet way, And your petitioner will ever pray. Eury. What should prevent our instant separation? Orph. For me, one serious consideration. From our United States, such bold secession Would greatly injure me in my profession. Parents and guardians would at me be preaching; At ladies' schools I should lose all my teaching; The Philharmonic would no more elect me; The Wandering Minstrels even would eject me. An artist can't afford the world to brave. Appearances we must contrive to save. Till death do part us I with you must bear, But let your precious bee-master beware! He's been a serpent in my path long known. Perchance he soon may find one in his own! Eury. What do you mean? Orph. No matter! Just you warn Him not to tread too hard upon my corn. (Exit Orpheus) Eury. Upon his corn? I seize his double sense! The monster's malice is no doubt prepense. He's found out that the field he grows his wheat in Is one my love and I are wont to meet in. Some man-trap or spring gun, no doubt he's put in it In hopes my charming swain may put his foot in it. Quick! Let me Aristæus fly to find. He must be somewhere yonder scenes behind. Enter Public Opinion. Pub. O. Of course; but now to see him would be wrong, He has to enter first and sing a song. This way, and patiently await your cue. Eury. I'd quite forgot—I'm much obliged to you. (Public Opinion leads Eurydice to wing—They bow, curtsey, and exeunt separately) Enter Aristæus. Recitative. Aristæus is my name—for my honey combs noted, A bee-master of fame—to melody devoted. Contented here I dwell, exempt from rent and tax. By the nymphs all esteemed, a lad of wax—(beeswax). Air. Neath the broad shade of trees, To sit in gardens sunny, Watching my pretty bees, So busy gathering honey. Or mark the morning, O'er earth and sky dispense her treasures, With gold the clouds adorning, With diamonds the plain, Oh, these are the pleasures Of an innocent swain. In the green fields to gaze On snow-white ewe and wether, Watching them gravely graze, Or gaily frisk together! Or in the clover The shepherdess reclined, who measures The moments till her lover Will greet her sight again. Oh, these are the pleasures Of an innocent swain. Aris. Before the world thus innocent I seem, But who I really am you little dream; Or what infernal mischief I'm projecting, If Orpheus but acts as I'm expecting, To-night I fancy we shall make a coup, And some one I won't name will get his due. But mum, for hither hastes my charming fair. Enter Eurydice, behind the corn field. Eury. In vain I seek! Ah, no! Behold him there! Aris. Eurydice! Eury. My Aristæus—stay! Not one step further if you love me, pray! Aris. Wherefore! Eury. Your life's in danger! Aris. Danger! Nay! You don't say so! Eury. I do! My jealous spouse On you the most terrific vengeance vows. Within this wheat he's set some horrid snare, And bade me bid you of it to beware! Aris. That's generous of him, I must admit, And so—I don't believe a word of it! In proof of which— Eury. Advance not, I implore— Go round— Aris. 'Twould go against the grain much more— Thus to my sweet Eurydice I fly! (enters corn field) Eury. Nay, then, with Aristæus let me die!— (enters corn field from back, and suddenly stops) Ah! Aris. What's the matter? Eury. Something's bitten me! There's a snake in the grass! (he leads her forward—she sinks on a rocky seat by house) Aris. And I am he! Pluto! become thy godlike self again! One! Two! Three! Presto! Pass! (changes to Pluto) Now for my train— The down express!—and come thou “black bat, Night,” As by a son of song thou hast been hight, In language more poetic than polite, Fly in the face of Day, and hide our flight! (the stage becomes dark, excepting a circle of limelight around Eurydice). Eury. What ails me? I am losing all sensation! Plu. Then for the modern stage you've no vocation! Air—Eurydice. Farewell! beloved Aristæus, Across the Styx I'm doomed to row; The cruel Fates will further see us, Than I alone now wish to go. Yet I should think myself their debtor, If they would only take you too— I feel I should be a shade better, If to the Shades I went with you. Eury. Adieu! I am no more! (dies) Plu. No more you are! But ere I pack you in my funeral car, You must a last word for your husband leave— You liked to have the last word I conceive? And you shall write it, as you've lost your breath, And shew the ruling passion strong in death; Although not quite consistent with chronology, I'll try a little electro-biology. (a fiery car rises, as a row of corn sinks—Pluto extends his bident over Eurydice; she rises as under a spell, and moves according to his direction round to the door of Orpheus's house) Fancy a pen—for characters ethereal Writing materials are not material. (she writes on door with her finger the following lines, which appear in letters of fire) “I'm dead; but my loss You will scarce think an evil; Aristæus was Pluto— I'm going to the—” Enter Public Opinion. Pub. O. Stop! The word's neither classic nor correct, And there's the Licenser, who might object. There can be no doubt of your destination. And “kind friends will accept this intimation.” Sad dogg'rel! But she's dead, you know, and I've Seen quite as bad by folks who are alive. Plu. Now for the realms below. The short cut there Is viâ Paris! Barriere D'Enfer! (Pluto lifts Eurydice into car, and sinks with her) Pub. O. Now the fun of all this, if there's any fun in it, Consists in the fact you may learn in a minute, Which is simply, that neither in fiction nor fact Can be found any grounds for the plot we enact. Neither husband nor wife ever gave the least handle, As far as we know, to so open a scandal. To her spouse fair Eurydice lived most devoted, And Orpheus on his Eurydice doated; And went for his own wife as quickly the deuce to, As though she'd been somebody else's. But truce to These comments for here comes our man, and you'll see What a job I shall have to make him follow me; But he must! for I'm here to control every action, And Public Opinion will have satisfaction. (stands aside) Enter Orpheus. Orph. Who has turned off the gas in the sky borders? Can Jupiter have given Nox new orders? It can't be noon, and yet day has shut up. I haven't dined, and it is time to sup! This is a very early closing movement, And only for one reason an improvement. I with my wife shall take but one repast Instead of two, and it will be the last. (approaches his door and sees the fiery inscription) What have we here? What demon has been scrawling Upon my door these characters appalling? My wife's handwriting! dead—and gone to—Well If ever! Pooh! Pshaw! this must be a sell! The news is too good to be true—yet no— She must be dead, or else she couldn't go— No matter—she is gone somewhere—and I Am free. Somebody coming—let me fly These unexpected tidings to impart To the divine possessor of my heart! (going—Public Opinion advances and stops him) Pub. O. Stop! I can't suffer this to pass—or you. Orph. Public Opinion! What would'st have me do? My wife is gone—whither, you here may learn, If not from “thoughts that breathe,” from “words that burn.” Pub. O. Follow me to Olympus, and implore Great Jove your bosom's partner to restore. Orph. Restore! my partner!—after dissolution Has been gazetted thus! Of elocution. Through a professor, I should language lack In such a cause. Why should I take her back? Pub. O. To edify posterity—to shew There was at least one husband who would go So far his cara-sposa to recover. Orph. But she is not my cara—I don't love her— Nay, if the plain truth must be told, I hate her. Pub. O. That will but make the great example greater. Posterity will— Orph. Hang posterity! What has posterity e'er done for me, That I should such consideration shew it? Pub. O. Despise Posterity! and you a poet! Orph. A poet! if there be a soul on earth To whom Posterity is nothing worth It is the poet. Left 'mongst fellow-men To live, that is—to starve upon his pen; And when in death his glorious eyes are dim, Leaving Posterity to feast on him; To crown with laurel his unconscious bust, To raise a pompous marble o'er his dust, Out of the harvest by his genius sown, Giving to him who wanted bread, a stone. Thanks to Apollo, I the fiddle play; And, let me tell you, that's the thing to pay! Pub. O. All very fine—and, may be, very true, But with our business it has nought to do. Will you to Jupiter with your petition? Orph. No! I will bear my fate with due submission. Pub. O. Then you defy Public Opinion? Orph. Nay; I but— Pub. O. No buts—but instantly obey, (shaking scourge) Or of my fury dread the flagellation! I'll ruin you in purse and reputation. Orph. Mercy! Pub. O. No mercy—yield upon the spot Assume a virtue, if you have it not. Public Opinion has sufficient gumption To comprehend the homage of assumption, And in all suits which claim its interference, Insists that you shall “put in an appearance.” Decide! Orph. 'Twixt Scylla and Charybdis! How? (aside) Well, to the world's opinion I must bow. (aloud) Sir, to be led by you I am content, And my petition humbly will present To the Upper House as soon as I am able, Praying it may be—(aside) laid upon the table. (aloud) But how ascend Olympus?—that's the rub; I'm not a member of the Alpine Club. Pub. O. Public Opinion will give you lift; The rise of those whom I take up is swift. Duet. Pub. O. Come, come, come, 'tis honour that calls you, and honour must be obeyed, So follow your leader and don't be afraid; I will be your companion, protector, and guide, Wherever you go, you'll have me on your side Orph. (aside) The honour that calls me, no way can I see to evade; So follow my leader I must I'm afraid; My companion he will be, whatever betide; Public Opinion must not be defied; (Public Opinion leads off Orpheus, who attempts to turn back, but is prevented by Public Opinion, and compelled to follow) END OF TABLEAU (OR ACT) FIRST.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Tableau (or Act) Second. —The Stage represents the summit of Olympus, but covered with clouds, in which Jupiter and other Deities are discovered asleep— Morpheus is pacing the stage and scattering poppies over them—a tripod, with fire. Chorus of Deities in their sleep. Strew on! strew on! His poppies o'er us Would Morpheus might for ever strew; For here to sleep and snore in chorus Appears the best thing we can do. Enter Cupid—Solo. Cupid. I'm Cupid, you see, God of Love, Adored in every clime and nation; I've flown back to the realms above To 'scape from Psyche's observation. Soundly here they slumber, All Olympus through! Why should not Love Sometimes sleep too? (lies down and sleeps) Enter Venus—Solo. Ven. I, Venus am—Beauty's Queen! To Paphos, where my earthly throne is, Upon an errand I have been, Which veiled in mystery, I own, is. Soundly here they slumber, All Olympus through! Some beauty sleep, Let me take too. (lies down and sleeps—hunting horns heard in the distance —Jupiter awakes, rises, and advances) Solo. Jup. What is all that noise that I hear? Who is making that uproar below? 'Tis Diana, my daughter dear, With her horns in very full blow. Up deities!—arise!—what ho! (all the Gods and Goddesses awake, arise, and come forward, stretching and yawning) And don't stand idly gaping there! With cheerful voice prepare To bid the huntress queen good morrow, The goddess of the silver bow! (throne descends—clouds clear off and shew the peak of the mountain by sunrise) Enter Diana, attended by Nymphs. Chorus. All hail, Diana! chaste as charming, Goddess of the silver bow! But what mean these looks of sorrow? What mean these symptoms alarming? Di. Oh, nothing can exceed my woe! Air. Whene'er Diana left the mountain, Tan, tan, tantivy, tan, tan, Actæon came Diana to see, Tan, tan, tantivy, tivee. Close hid in a bush beside a fountain, Tan, tan, tantivy, tan, tan, There was Actæon sure to be, Tan, tan, tantivy, tivee. Chorus. There was Actæon sure to be. Di. But when this morn I left the mountain, Tan, tan, tantivy, tan, tan! Hoping Actæon I should see, Tan, tan tantivy, tivee! Close hid in the bush beside the fountain, Tan, tan, tantivy, tan, tan, No Actæon was there to see me, Tantivy, tantivy, tivee. Chorus. No Actæon was there to see. Di. My poor Actæon! I can't sleep a wink! What has become of him I cannot think! He who each day behind the bushes hid. He thought I didn't see him—but I did. Jup. What has become of him d'ye wish to know? His conduct was by no means comme il faut! And would have compromised you soon, Diana. So I've relieved you of him. Di. In what manner? Jup. Into a stag transformed him—nothing more. He was, you know, a smart young buck before. And to preserve on earth your reputation, I've said 'twas done at your solicitation. Di. At mine! Jup. At yours. The whole world has been told You thought his curiousity too bold. Di. Why? Jup. For the honour of Mythology. Mortals begin into our acts to pry If we would put a check on their impiety, We must pay some attention to propriety. Di. You pay it great attention—don't you? Juno. Eh? Has he again been gallivanting? Jup. Nay! Juno, my dear! indeed, mere circulations Of the old stories in cheap publications. It's those vile poets! rot 'em! 'Pon my word it is. Who sing about me all sorts of absurdities! Juno. No, no! I'm sure there must be something new. If you know, tell me, dear Diana, do? Jup. Madam, no scenes in public I desire. And silence all! I now have to inquire Into a matter delicate to mention. But justice must be done. Mars! Mars. (saluting) Here! Jup. Attention! You're charged by Vulcan with— Ven. It isn't true! Jup. Hah! then you know you're inculpated too? But true or not, henceforward I expect Your conduct, Venus, will be more correct. Nor yours alone—as the sky's censor morum, I charge you all to observe more decorum. Ven. Tyrant! (general murmurs) Jup. Where's Cupid? him this much concerns. Juno. There, kissing Hebe. (at the fire-tripod) Jup. While the ambrosia burns! (brings Cupid forward by the ear) You graceless scamp! if here you play your tricks, I'll beat you black and blue! I will by Styx! Cupid. Let go my ear! See if I don't tell mother! Jup. There's six of one, and half a dozen of t'other! Arn't you content with driving mortals mad, That you must try to make the gods as bad? Cupid. (to Venus) Mamma, I won't put up with this much longer; I'll let him know which of the two is stronger. Mars. That's right! let's all rebel! Sound Love's alarms, And every deity will fly to arms. Di. 'Pa 'Piter's really getting too despotic! Ven. To talk of beating Love is idiotic. Jup. Murmurs! Begone! And see you're all more steady. Ganymede, tell me when my nectar's ready. (all the Deities exeunt, grumbling) Now, by myself! They're actually grumbling! I must begin to set my thunder rumbling. I've been too easy with these brats of mine— They'll be disputing soon my right divine. And in addition I have got to bear That jealous termagant's— Re-enter Juno. Ahem, she's there! Sticks to me like a leech! (aloud) Ah, dearest wife! Anything new? Juno. I'm tired of my life! Jup. That is a pity, as you cannot end it. But what's amiss, my dear? and can I mend it? Juno. “A miss, my dear!” There always is a miss, Or else a mistress—as, I hear, is this. Jup. This what? I swear that causeless are your fears. Juno. From earth a fresh report has reached my ears; By some licentious god, a female—married, Off from her husband yesterday was carried. Beautiful— Jup. “As a butterfly, and proud “As— A line from a popular song of the day—“Pretty Polly Perkins, of Paddington Green.” Juno. Silence! My wrongs for justice cry aloud. I've all the facts—I know the woman's name! Jup. Polly? Juno. Ah, try to hide your little game By this indifference; but it won't do. Her name's Eurydice—the god was you! Jup. I? Come, that's capital! Juno. Who else would dare? Jup. Of this abduction I was quite aware. Juno. Of course! Jup. And have sent Mercury to learn The truth, and am expecting his return. For your suspicions there is no foundation, But mine, I think, will meet with confirmation. He comes! I hear the rustle of his wings; Now we shall know the real state of things. Enter Mercury. Mer. Hail to the mighty king of gods and— Jup. Use No ceremony. Briefly, what's your news? Mer. Back at full speed from Tartarus I come. Jup. Where you found Pluto? Mer. He was not at home! Jup. Out for the day? Mer. For fourteen days— Juno. And nights? Jup. You didn't see him then? Mer. Between the lights An hour ago he came back to his throne. Jup. From whence? Mer. The earth. Jup. Alone? No, not alone. He brought a lady with him, a fair dame He'd taken from her husband. Jup. And her name? Mer. Eurydice. Jup. (to Juno) I hope you're satisfied? Juno. I am; this time it cannot be denied. But what says Pluto's wife to this affair? Will Proserpine this insult tamely bear? Mer. She's with her mother, Ceres, gone to stay Six months as usual. Jup. (aside) What a holiday For Pluto! would my wife would do the same. Juno. What are you saying? Jup. I say what a shame That Pluto should advantage take so base Of his wife's absence. Juno. Say it to his face! Jup. I will! (to Mercury) You called the lady fair—d'ye mean Really—she's handsome? Mer. Sire, as beauty's queen. Jup. (aside) Lucky dog, Pluto! Juno. What d'ye say, my dear? Jup. I say 'tis lucky Pluto is not here. Just at this moment my wrath so intense is I wouldn't answer for the consequences! Mer. I told him you required his presence. Jup. Good. Juno. And will he come? Mer. He promised that he would. I think I hear the wheels now of his carriage! Jup. I'll teach him to respect the bonds of marriage! Juno. By setting him a good example, Jove? Jup. Of course; but go and get your breakfast, love— I'll punish him, if you'll to me just leave him. He comes! Fly, Mercury—do you receive him. (Exeunt Juno and Mercury) And so this woman really is a beauty! Then, as a judge, 'twill be my painful duty To see her. Enter Mercury, preceeding Pluto, who is followed by two Demons bearing a large hamper. Mer. (announcing) His Infernal Majesty! (Exit Mercury) Plu. Hail, Jupiter, great king of earth and sky; Father of gods and men— Jup. That's quite enough! We'll spare you more preamble. Plu. (aside) Rather gruff; And looks at me askance. Does he suspect? To find his palace splendid I'll affect. (aloud) Oh, happy Jove! Upon Olympus fair To live amongst the clouds, in the pure air! While I am doom'd my dark abode to fix Upon the gloomy banks of stagnant Styx. Here all is light, and melody, and bloom. Of everlasting flowers the perfume Each zephyr bears. Nor not alone of flowers, The perfume of the Graces, and the Hours, The perfume of the— Jup. Cease this flowery flummery! Talk sense, if possible, and not perfumery! Plu. Why that is scents! Jup. Pluto! Don't incense me! I've sent for you, and if I chance to be Upon the right scent, such is your offence, You'll have hard work to prove your innocence! But first one question, if I'm free to ask it, Who are those ugly beggars with a basket? Plu. My cook and butler, with my usual fare. I cannot live on food so light and rare As nectar and ambrosia; I require Something that has more strength in it and fire. (to 1st Demon) Hand the “menu.” (to Jupiter) There, tell me what you think. Jup. (looking at bill of fare) Think! that you well know what to eat and drink. Plu. And what to avoid, most potent grandpapa! Jup. Why, zooks! you live like a three-tailed bashaw! If thus you banquet in the realms below, It's almost an inducement there to go. This is exactly what the earth complains of: That rogues, when sent a jail to feel the pains of, Lead jolly idle lives, and cut their jokes, And fare much better than poor honest folks. Plu. But I'm the governor, and in my station Are you surprised I seek some consolation? Jup. Seek consolation! yes, and find it too In fruit forbidden, worse than this I view. Where have you been this fortnight? Plu. Frying on The sulph'rous shores of fiery Phlegethon. Jup. Not so! By the report of my police, You have been frying other fish—in Greece! Not far from Thebes—in a suburban cottage. Plu. Sire, I— Jup. Oh, spare your breath to cool your pottage! You with a fiddler's wife have run away, And swingeing damages will have to pay. Plu. 'Tis false! the scandal soon can be refuted. Jup. Silence! my word is not to be disputed. When Jove speaks, heaven and earth obedient bow! (uproar within) Holloa! what mean those shouts? Plu. They mean a row. Enter Juno, alarmed, followed by all the Deities, tumultuously. Chorus of the Revolt. To arms! each god and demi-god! Endure no longer this subjection! Break at once the tyrant's rod! Jup. (on throne) A revolution—an insurrection! Olympus, Jove defies! Plu. An insurrection in the skies! Out of Jove this is taking a rise! Cupid. No more nectar, no more ambrosia! Chorus. Nectar we hate! Di. It is a liquor makes me sick! Chorus. Yes, makes us sick! Ven. Ambrosia, too, I abominate! Chorus. No more ambrosia! Plu. You're right enough; 'Tis mawkish stuff. Ambrosia Is not for gods the fare. Come and share My symposia! Chorus. To arms! each god and demi-god, &amp;c. Jup. What do I hear! This is downright sedition! To my commands do you refuse submission? All. We do! Ven. We mean to act just as we choose! Min. This everlasting sky gives me the blues! All. We're starved! Jup. On nectar and ambrosia? Mars. Oh! We're sick of them! Plu. You're right! Bravo! Bravo! Here—share my prog—there's plenty of it—see! A boar's head! (Demons open basket and take out provisions and wine) Ven. Oh! give some of that to me! Cupid. In memory of Adonis? Ven. Hold your tongue! How dare you twit your ma! you saucy—young— Plu. A venison pasty! Di. Oh, Actæon, dear! If you have been cut up, and put in here, I couldn't touch a bit—and yet I must; Give me a small piece of the kissing crust! Plu. Wine and liqueurs! To help yourselves you're free! Ven. Champagne! Cupid. Parfait amour! Mars. And eau de vie! Jup. Revolt!—rebellion! And to be your chief You do not blush to take that sensual thief! All. Thief! Plu. I am not a thief! Jup. You are—you stole The wife of Orpheus—poor pretty soul! Ven. Is that all? Jup. All! Is it not verbum sat? Plu. And what have you done, if you come to that? Juno. There—there! I was too sure— Plu. Before you tax Others with being in their morals lax, Just look at home. I know a thing or two, Good Master Jove, that I could tell of you. Di. And I. Ven. And I. All. And all! Cupid. We've made a song About you. You shall hear it; it's not long. Jup. I've an appointment with my lawyer. (going) Juno. (turning him back) Nay; You stir not till I've heard all they've to say. Couplets. Min. To captivate the proud Alcmena, Her husband's form you took one day; With some wives that would not have been a Successful game at all to play. Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! These fine airs with us won't do; We know you better, Mr. Ju! Chorus. Ha, ha, ha, &amp;c. Di. It must have been the same disguise, sir, Which you assumed, of mischief full, When fair Europa to surprise, sir, The horns your sported of a bull. Ha, ha, ha, &amp;c. Cupid. To Danäe, from love defended By brazen walls about her built, You in a shower of gold descended, Which proved your gold was only gilt. Ha, ha, ha, &amp;c. Ven. The swan who, from an eagle flying. In Leda's arms sweet refuge took— That swan was you, there's no denying, Though now more like a goose you look. Ha, ha, ha, &amp;c. Plu. 'Tis clear from all this transformation, You are so ugly that you know Your only chance of fascination Is in some other shape to go. Ha, ha, ha, &amp;c. (goes up) Chorus. Ha, ha, ha, &amp;c. Juno. Then 'twas all true. O traitor—O, deceiver! I've been by far too easy a believer. Somebody catch me; I am going to faint! (falls in Pluto arms) Jup. Don't be alarmed! it is her old complaint. She'll come to presently. Plu. Take your wife, do! Juno. Oh! Jup. This was all before I married you. Juno. Oh! Plu. Take your wife. Jup. A little if I've roved, You are the only one I ever loved. These scandalmongers— Plu. Will you take your wife? Jup. These arch disturbers of connubial— Ven. Strife! Plu. If you don't take your wife, I'll drop her! Enter Mercury. Mer. Sire! Jup. What now? Mer. Two strangers for great Jove inquire. Jup. Their names! Mer. One—Orpheus. (Juno jumps up and arranges her hair and drapery) Plu. (aside) Orpheus! It grows hotter. (aloud) Will you take—(missing Juno) Holloa! Why I haven't got her! Jup. (to Pluto) Now, infidel, I have thee on the hip! Mer. The other's a young fellow with a whip, He calls himself Public Opinion. Jup. Zounds! Public Opinion seems to set no bounds To his audacity. My friends, (to Deities) you know Of this I warned you not an hour ago. Public Opinion is progressing fast, And as you see has reached our doors at last. Plu. Don't let him in—the prying, meddling scout! Jup. Don't let him in? Who is to shut him out? Our policy's to pay him all attention And sink before him family dissension. Hither he comes on public grounds alone, Bring my best thunder and set out my throne. When mortals plead, Jove justice out must deal 'em. Ahem! Fiat justitia! Ruat Cælum! Plu. Admit him! Who's afraid? Jup. Ha, so defiant! Go! (to Mercury) Introduce Opinion and his client. (Exit Mercury—throne and seats brought on) Now let him nothing see about our Court Which may discredit us in his report To men below. Take all your godlike stand About my throne—Wisdom on my right hand. (to Minerva) Juno. And I? Jup. My wife—my queen! Beside me seated. (leads Juno to throne) (aside) Public Opinion has been oft so cheated. You, Venus, on my left, in smiles arrayed; Opinion by good looks is vastly swayed. Plu. And where am I to stand? Jup. Why, where you are! To take your trial; prisoner at the bar! You others, where you please; but for effect, In attitudes most classic and correct. They come! (Ganymede hands Jupiter a thunderbolt) What's this I see?—a dingy every day bolt! Quick! my best thunder, didn't you hear me say, dolt? (Ganymede gives him another) Ha! so! (looking round him) Well grouped! To mortal eyes disclosing Nothing beyond a tableau, most—imposing! Finale to Second Tableau. Enter Mercury, introducing Public Opinion and Orpheus. Plu. He approaches—he advances! Yes no doubt 'tis he! 'tis he! Plague upon him! Now the chances May be turning against me. Di. Venus. and Chorus. He approaches—he advances! Yes, no doubt 'tis he! 'tis he! Pluto looks as though the chances Were against him very like to be. Jup. He approaches—he advances! Yes, no doubt 'tis he! 'tis he! Much against him were the chances, But a friend he now shall find in me! Pub. O. With reluctance he advances, But obedient he must be; (to Orpheus) Jove awaits you; all the chance is In your favour I can plainly see! Orph. (aside) 'Gainst my will each foot advances; But my fate I cannot flee! To escape there now no chance is. I'm in for it, I can plainly see! Chorus. Let us hear! let us see! Pub. O. (to Oprheus) Go on—go on! your course pursue. I will see justice done to you. Orph. Ah! this is too!— Too kind of you! Pub. O. Obedient be. These scourges view. My anger dread; my vengeance fear. Remember who Has eyes on you! Jup. (to Orpheus) Mortal, what is to Jove thy prayer? Pub. O. (to Orpheus) The moment is come for you now, In tones would melt the hardest hearted, To implore great Jove will allow You down to the Shades to repair, And recover your dear departed! Orph. What must be, must—heigho! (to Jupiter) My Eurydice is stolen from me. (plays on his violin) Di., Ven., and Cupid. Well that charming air I know! Oh, how touching is his woe! Orph. And the robber's name? Jup. Is— Orph. Is Pluto! Chorus. 'Tis Pluto! Jup. To punish I am bound, Whoe'er be the offender. Pluto guilty if found Shall Eurydice surrender. Orph. (aside) Alas! alas! he grants my prayer! Plu. (aside) Alas! alas! I lose my fair! Jup. And to see my decree Is obeyed as it should be To the regions below, Pluto, with thee I go. Chorus. Oh, Jupiter, pray do Let us all go with you. Oh do! pray do! Good Ju! dear Ju! Jup. Agreed! It will be something new For us to do. Chorus. All hail to mighty Jove! To the monarch kind and gay! Who all petty revenge above, Gives us this glorious holiday. Away! away! Hurrah! hurrah! Awhile adieu, dull vaults of blue, Fresh spirit vault, with spirits new, We seek with you, most jovial Ju!

      <field name="fulltext">Tableau (or Act) Third. —The Palace of Pluto—In the centre his throne—on either side grated gates of bronze, through which is seen at a distance the Infernal Regions, and the river Styx, and the Elysian Fields. Enter Eurydice. Eury. Not yet returned!—no news!—and not a soul To speak to in this sulphurous black hole Except a horrible three-headed cur, Who won't allow me out of doors to stir. Not that I've any wish that way to wander, (pointing) Nor even on the banks of Styx to ponder; But if I'd only somebody to talk with, Or in the Elysian Fields to take a walk with— When I say body, I, of course, mean shade. If this much longer lasts I am afraid I to regret my husband shall begin. And almost wish to hear his violin! Nothing can stronger prove my desperation, Than the idea of such an inclination. Enter Cerberus. Cer. Did you call, madam? Eury. Call? good gracious! no! You ugly dog! what do you want here? go! Cer. I thought I heard you call. Eury. Then you thought wrong. Cer. (aside) She sets my heart a-beating like a gong. She is so lovely! I ne'er saw a shade With such a colour, nor so sweetly made! (aloud) I'm very sorry that you didn't call. Eury. Wherefore? Cer. Because you want nothing at all! If you did—oh! 'twould give me such great pleasure To come—to go—to fetch—to carry— Eury. Eh! Sure The dog's gone mad! Cer. He has, with love for you! You've turned my three heads, until what to do I know not! Eury. Turn out, instantly! or you Shall have your three heads knocked against each other Soon as your master comes. Cer. My master! Smother My master in his own dun smoke. I weary Of being porter in this palace dreary. I who once had a palace of my own! Aye, madam! and who sat upon a throne Compared to which this is a shabby stool! Yes! I! This mongrel hound!—Let me be cool, If it be possible in such a place— Was once a king! Eury. Really! is that the case? Cer. King of Bœotia! Hear what me befell; No dog had ever such a tale to tell. Song—Cerberus. When I was monarch of Bœtia, I'd slaves and soldiers at my call; But 'gainst a stronger having striven, I lost my life, and so lost all; And by stern Fate down here was driven, To keep dog-watches in this hall, Where these three heads were to me given. Because I had no head at all. When I was monarch of Bœotia. Were I still monarch of Bœotia, My hand I'd offer on my knee, But as I've neither crown nor coffer, Your lap-dog I but crave to be. The prettiest dog can only proffer, As the French song says, “ce quil'à,” So as I have no hand to offer. I humbly beg you'll take the paw Of an ex-monarch of Bœotia. Eury. 'Tis strange; but no doubt true! I've a strong notion There's much about you yet that is Bœotian. Out of respect, sir, for your former state, I beg on me you will no longer wait. Cer. (aside) She treats me like a dog! (aloud) Oh, madam! Eury. Hark! (Pluto and Jupiter appear at gate) There's some one at the gate? and you don't bark? Cer. No! 'Tis my master, and though full of spite, I'm not the dog to bark when I can't bite. Eury. Pluto! And who seeks with him this dark clime? Cer. Jupiter. Eury. Oh, by Jupiter, how prime! I've always heard he is so fond of ladies; Perhaps he'll kindly take one out of Hades. Enter Jupiter and Pluto. Eury. and Cer. Hail, mighty Jove! Plu. (to Cerberus) What do you here about? Jup. Rise, fair Eurydice. Pluto. (to Cerberus) And you—get out! (Exit Cerberus) Jup. (aside) Faith! she is positively quite bewitching! To think of such a gem this rogue enriching. Plu. Now ask her; let her say it if she can, That I ran off with her from any man, She trod upon an adder, 'twas her fate; She must have walked down here at any rate. For Tartarus I happened to be bound, And was just starting by the Underground, So took compassion on her pretty feet, And in my carriage offered her a seat! Now, I should like to know how I'm to blame. I ask you—wouldn't you have done the same? Jup. All very specious, sir; but to arrive at The truth, I must examine her in private. Plu. In private? Jup. Yes, she may say that to me, She wouldn't say to you. Plu. (aside) Zounds! that may be. (to Eurydice) Eurydice, I'm very ill at ease— Jup. No tampering with the witness, if you please. Go play the host to each Olympic visitor, And leave me here to play the Grand Inquisitor. Plu. (aside) Inquisitor indeed! I'm on the rack! (aloud) I go! (aside) But, trust me—I will soon be back! (Exit Pluto) Jup. Now, madam! freely make to Jove your prayer. Eury. I'm sighing for a little change of air. Jup. You would not longer here with Pluto stay? Eury. Oh, no, indeed—not for a single day. Pluto re-enters behind and listens. Jup. You do not love him, then? Eury. Love Pluto! No! Jup. Delightful! Who on earth then was your beau? Eury. As Aristæus, he with honeyed tongue Won my poor heart—for he was handsome—young. How could I fancy one so sweet and civil Would turn out, when at home—the very devil! Jup. The case is much too common—I could name Hundreds of women who've said just the same! Not that it mends his case the least in life— The vile impostor! And with such a wife! Eury. A wife! And is he married too? The wretch! Jup. My grand-daughter—whom he'd the luck to catch Much as he did you, and down here to carry her. But, faith, I punished him—I made him marry her! I'm glad I cannot make him marry you. Eury. I'm very glad of it, I'm sure, sir, too! Jup. But Jove will do you justice—never fear! You shall not tarry in these regions drear; Up to Olympus I will bear thee, sweet, And lap thee in Elysium! Eury. What a treat! Let's fly this minute! Mercy! Who are these? (Pluto flings open door of banquet chamber, and enter Juno and all the Gods and Goddesses, crowned with flowers, and bearing goblets) Jup. My wife, with all the rout of Deities! Chorus. Fill bumpers up!—pour bumpers down! Here's to our royal host, The King who wears the iron crown! Do honour to the toast! Instead of melancholy, He makes us awful jolly! His spicy wines inspire us, His ardent spirits fire us! 'Tis he rules the roast. Fill bumpers up! pour bumpers down, &amp;c. The realm where he obeyed is For us exactly made is. All care in Lethe drown, And drink the King of Hades, Who wears the iron crown! (Jupiter introduces Eurydice to Juno and the principal Deities, who enter) Jup. (to Juno) My dear—the lady you have heard so much of. Juno. (drawing herself up) She's no great sight. Here there are plenty such of! Eury. Madam! Jup. (aside to Eurydice) Don't mind her; she means nothing wrong; But Pluto's coffee's evidently strong. Plu. (aside) It's strong enough to keep me wide awake, As you shall both find out, and no mistake! Recitative. Jup. Now, by way of change, with the fair Eurydice A minuet I'll dance, like the great King Louis. (Jupiter leads out Eurydice, and Mercury, Hebe) Minuet. Diana, Venus, Minerva, and Cupid. With what an easy air he bows and glides; Really, when you see him dance-a, Had he but the wig besides, You'd take him for the King of France-a! None can surely walk a minuet With such perfect elegance-a! Of the ballet he's the pet; Jupiter is the vrai Dieu de la danse-a! Vestris, in his greatest day, Never moved with more grace; E'en Terpsichore might say, “I to Jove give place.” With what an easy air, &amp;c. Chorus. The ball now to finish let us all, Both great and small, dance, in this hall, A galopade fantastical! This ball now to finish, let us all, Both great and small, dance, in this hall, A “Galop Infernal!” La, la, la, &amp;c. Galop—at the end of which, all except Jupiter, Eurydice, and Pluto, who watches them, appear completely exhausted and out of breath) Jup. This favourable moment let me seize, And gallop off. Plu. (advancing) No further if you please. Jup. Plague take him! Pluto! If Jove pleases, who Shall stop him? Plu. Jove himself! Come, master Ju, No swaggering. I'm up to all your tricks. Have you forgotten what you swore by Styx? Her husband's coming, to whom you are bound To give her up, if guilty I was found. Eury. My husband! Jup. Burn the Styx! Eury. Coming for me? Oh no, he never would! Plu. Well, we shall see. (violin heard in distance) Hark! Eury. Yes, that is the sound of his Cremona, Of which he is so proud to be the owner, He must be mad! Plu. If not, you'll make him so. Eury. Great Jupiter! and will you let me go? Plu. He can't avoid it. It is now, false shade, My turn to triumph! Jup. (to Eurydice) Don't you be afraid. I've hit upon a plan. (aloud) Ho! all ye Deities! Resume your gravities, and leave your gaieties. The plaintiff in this case now comes to pray The Court for judgment on an early day. Behold him yonder, with my learned brother; Call, “Orpheus versus Pluto and another.” (Orpheus and Public Opinion are seen arriving in the boat of Charon, on the river Styx—Jupiter takes his seat on Pluto's throne—Orpheus and Public Opinion land and advance) Orph. Great King of— (addressing Jupiter) Jup. That will do! The case we've heard, And judgment longer shall not be deferred. Pluto, the Court now orders to restore To your fond arms the wife whom you adore. Orph. My joy o'erwhelms me. Jove is far too good. Jup. On one condition be it understood, For reasons perfectly inexplicable, And which no mortal ever will be able To comprehend. It is our high decree— To earth you must precede Eurydice, Who in your steps will follow close; but mind you Whate'er may hap you must not look behind you. Though you have now evinced most rare affection, Your antecedents won't bear retrospection. So take fair warning—ere you reach yon shore Look once behind—you're where you were before! Plu. But I don't understand! Jup. Who said you did? Orpheus, forward! March as you are bid! Concerted Piece. Pub. O. (to Orpheus) Not one glance must you cast behind you. Upon the ground your eyes now fix. The stakes are not won, mind you, Till you have gained the Styx. (Public Opinion turns Orpheus round with his face to the gate, and precedes him slowly— Eurydice follows Orpheus reluctantly at the command of Jupiter. Di., Ven., Min. and Cupid. Poor husband! What will be his lot? He will look back! He will not! He will! He will not! Of coffee I will bet a pot! He will look back! He will not! He will! He will not! Jup. Upon his curiosity have I in vain relied? Pub. O. (passing the gate) We triumph! Oh, what joy! What pride! Jup. (as Orpheus approaches the gate) He will not look back! Then thunder-bolt Fly! Crush the dolt! (brandishes his thunder-bolt, and at the same moment flings out his right foot energetically, a stream of electric light issues from it, and strikes Orpheus just as he is passing the gate —he turns suddenly—Eurydice disappears) All. Ah! Pub. O. Wretched man! A look behind, you've cast one! Orph. 'Twas such a kick! I thought it was my last one. Plu. (to Orpheus) You've lost her now, for good and all, She's mine beyond recall! Jup. No—no—not yours. Plu. How so? Jup. No! for I made her a Bacchante! All. A Bacchante! Plu. But there's no sense in— Jup. I'm of that quite sensible. I told you it was quite incomprehensible. Plu. I say in Hades she must stay with me. Jup. No, she to Bacchus shall high priestess be. Pub. O. Peace, and attention all. 'Tis now the hour For me to exercise my boundless power. Eurydice to earth I shall restore, The wife of Orpheus to be once more, To live in love and perfect harmony; His music shall again enchanting be— Throughout the world assert its old dominion, Stamped by the verdict of Public Opinion! Jup. What, shall he neither lose his wife nor wits? Plu. Nor be by Thracian women torn to bits? Jup. Mythology that's not according to. Pub. O. It is my theology, and quite as true. When history is being all re-made, Can Fable hope the movement to evade? Ye silly, sensual, sham deities! Ye'd ne'er been gods if mortals had been wise; They're growing wiser daily, and soon I Shall have to sweep ye all out of the sky. Cupid. All! you forget this little fellow here. Pub. O. I beg your pardon, so I did, my dear. Cupid will never be without a shrine; But would you honours really own divine, Use your power but for good, and not for evil— Be a great god, and not a little devil! When off his fickle pinions he shall shake, Win hearts to make them happy—not to break, Yield less to passion—never stoop to greed, Then Love will be a deity indeed! Ven. Strip Cupid of his pinions! Well, I'm sure He'd make of my poor boy a perfect cure! Orph. And what about the piece, sir, if you please? Pub. O, Ah, there I pause! In matters such as these Public Opinion is, I must confess, Very much guided by the public press— So as the Judge says when his wig he's shook at 'em, I'll take the papers home with me and look at 'em. Jup. And what is to become of the last scene? Pub. O. Shew it exactly as it would have been If you had had your way instead of me; And I'll request the fair Eurydice, As Offenbach has done, without more parley, To sing, as a Bacchante, the finale! Scene changes to the Temple of Bacchus—Bacchus enters in a car drawn by Panthers, and attended by Nymphs, —Fairies, Satyrs. &amp;c.—Eurydice as a Bacchante. Air—Eurydice. I see the god of wine! Ever fair and ever young! Beneath a golden vine With purple grapes hung! The Fawns with cloven feet, The Nymphs with their flowing hair, His praises repeat— Evoë! Evoë! Glory to Bacchus! king of the vine! Glory to Bacchus! god of wine! Filled is my soul with his frenzy divine! Glory to Bacchus! god of wine! “O leave!” he gaily cries, “Sorrow, suffering, and despair, To those whom Fate denies My bounty to share, And quaff this juice divine, And own that for every care The true Lethe is wine!” Evoë! Evoë! Glory to Bacchus! king of the vine! Glory to Bacchus! god of wine! Filled is my soul with his frenzy divine! Glory to Bacchus! god of wine! (advancing to the front and to Audience) In France, I, as a Bacchante, Took to drinking—sad result of sorrow, as you often see; But here as a merry Offenbach-ante, I hope you will often back repair to sing with me! La! la! la! la! &amp;c. Chorus. La! la! la! la! &amp;c. (picture) CURTAIN.</field>
