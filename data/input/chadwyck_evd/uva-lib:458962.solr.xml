      <field name="fulltext">TO MY WORTHILY RESPECTED FRIENDS, Nathaniel Finch, Iohn Ford, Esquires; Mr. Henry Blvnt, Mr. Robert Ellice, and all the rest of the Noble Society of Grayes Inne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my Honour'd Friend, Master Iohn Ford, on his Louers Melancholy. If that thou think'st these lines thy worth can raise, Thou do'st mistake; my liking is no prayse: Nor can I thinke thy Iudgement is so ill, To seeke for Bayes from such a barraine Quill: Let your true Critick, that can iudge and mend, Allow thy Sceanes and Stile: I, as a friend That knowes thy worth, doe onely sticke my Name, To shew my Loue, not to aduance thy Fame. George Donne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his worthy Friend, the Author, Master Iohn Ford. I write not to thy Play: Ile not begin To throw a censure vpon what hath been By th'Best approu'd; It can nor feare, nor want The Rage, or Liking of the Ignorant. Nor seeke I Fame for Thee, when thine owne Pen Hath forc'd a praise long since, from knowing Men. I speake my thoughts, and wish vnto the Stage A glory from thy studies; that the Age May be indebted to Thee, for Reprieue Of purer language, and that Spight may grieue To see It selfe out-done. When Thou art read, The Theater may hope Arts are not dead, Though long conceal'd; that Poet-Apes may feare To vent their weaknesse, mend, or quite forbeare. This I dare promise; and keepe this in store; As thou hast done enough, Thou canst doe more. William Singleton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Author, Master Iohn Ford. Blacke choler, Reasons ouer-flowing Spring, Where thirsty Louers drinke, or any Thing, Passion, the restlesse current of dull plaints Affords their thoughts, who deeme lost beauties, Saints: Here their best Lectures read, collect, and see Various conditions of Humanitie Highly enlighten'd by thy Muses rage; Yet all so coucht, that they adorn'd the Stage. Shun Phocions blushes thou; for sure to please It is no sinne, then what is thy disease? Iudgements applause? effeminated smiles? Studie's delight? thy wit mistrust beguiles: Establisht Fame will thy Physicion be, (Write but againe) to cure thy Iealousie. Hum. Howorth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of the Louers Melancholy. Tis not the Language, nor the fore-plac'd Rimes Of Friends, that shall commend to after-times The Louers Melancholy: Its owne worth Without a borrowed prayse, shall set it forth. ? ?????.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGVE. To tell yee (Gentlemen) in what true sense The Writer, Actors, or the audience Should mold their Iudgem?ts for a Play, might draw Truth into Rules, but we haue no such law. Our Writer, for himselfe would haue yee know, That in his following Sceanes, he doth not owe To others Fancies, nor hath layne in wait For any stolne Inuention, from whose height He might commend his owne, more then the right A Scholer claimes, may warrant for delight. It is Arts scorne, that some of late haue made The Noble vse of Poetry a Trade. For your parts (Gentlemen) to quite his paines, Yet you will please, that as you meet with straines Of lighter mixtures, but to cast your eye Rather vpon the maine, then on the bye. His hopes stand firme, and we shall find it true, The Louers Melancholy cur'd by you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus I. Scena I. Enter Menaphon and Pelias. Menaphon. Dangers? How meane you dangers? that so courtly You gratulate my safe returne from dangers? Pel. From Trauailes (noble Sir.) Men. These are delights, If my experience hath not Trewant-like Mis-spent the time, which I haue stroue to vse, For bettering my mind with obseruation. Pel. As I am modest, I protest 'tis strange: But is it possible? Men. What? Pel. To bestride The frothy fomes of Neptunes surging waues, When blustring Boreas tosseth vp the deepe, And thumps a thunder bounce? Men. Sweet Sir, 'tis nothing, Straight comes a Dolphin playing neere your ship, Heauing his crooked backe vp, and presents A Feather-bed, to waft'ee to the shoare, As easily as if you slept i'th' Court. Pel. Indeed, is't true, I pray? Men. I will not stretch Your Faith vpon the Teinters, prethee Pelias, Where didst thou learne this language? Pel. I this language? Alas, Sir, we that study words and formes Of complement, must fashion all discourse, According to the nature of the subiect. Enter Amethus, Sophronos, and Attendants. But I am silent, now appeares a Sunne, Whose shadow I adore. Men. My honour'd Father. Soph. From mine eyes, son, son of my care, my loue, The ioyes that bid thee welcome, doe too much speake me a child. Men. O Princely Sir, your hand. Amet. Performe your duties where you owe them first, I dare not be so sudden in the pleasures, Thy presence hath brought home. Soph. Here thou still findest A Friend as noble (Menaphon) as when Thou left'st at thy departure. Men. Yes, I know it, To him I owe more seruice.â Amet. Pray giue leaue, He shall attend your intertainements soone, Next day, and next day, for an houre or two, I would engrosse him onely. Soph. Noble Lord. Ame. Y'are both dismist. Pel. Your creature, and your Seruant. Exeunt all but Ameth. Menap. Ame. Giue me thy hand, I will not say, Th'art welcome, That is the common roade of c?mon friends, I am glad I haue thee hereâO, I want words To let thee know my heart. Men. 'Tis peec'd to mine. Ame. Yes, 'tis, as firmely, as that holy thing Call'd Friendship can vnite it. Menaphon, My Menaphon: now all the goodly blessings, That can create a Heauen on earth, dwell with thee. Twelue monthes we haue been sundred, but henceforth We neuer more will part, till that sad houre, In which death leaues the one of vs behind, To see the others funerals perform'd. Let's now a while be free. How haue thy trauailes Disburth'ned thee abroad of discontents? Men. Such cure as sicke men find in changing beds, I found in change of Ayres; the fancy flatter'd My hopes with ease, as theirs doe, but the griefe Is still the same. Ame. Such is my case at home. Cleophyla, thy Kinswoman, that Maide Of sweetnesse and humility, more pities Her Fathers poore afflictions, then the tide Of my complaints. Men. Thamasta, my great Mistris, Your Princely Sister, hath, I hope ere this, Confirm'd affection on some worthy choice. Ame. Not any, Menaphon. Her bosome yet Is intermur'd with Ice, though by the truth Of loue, no day hath euer past, wherein I haue not mention'd thy deserts, thy constancy ThyâCome, in troth I dare not tell thee what, Lest thou mightst thinke I fawnd vpon a sinne Friendship was neuer guilty of; for flattery Is monstrous in a true friend. Men. Does the Court Weare the old lookcs too? Ame. If thou mean'st the Prince, It does, hee's the same melancholy man, He was at's Fathers death, sometimes speakes sence, But seldome mirth; will smile, but seldome laugh; Will lend an eare to businesse, deale in none; Gaze vpon Reuels, Anticke Fopperies, But is not mou'd; will sparingly discourse, Heare musicke; but what most he takes delight in, Are handsome pictures; one so young, and goodly, So sweet in his owne nature, any Story Hath seldome mentioned. Men. Why should such as I am, Groane vnder the light burthens of small sorrowes, When as a Prince, so potent, cannot shun Motions of passion? To be man (my Lord) Is to be but the exercise of cares In seuerall shapes; as miseries doe grow, They alter as mens formes; but how, none know. Ame. This little Ile of Cyprus sure abounds In greater wonders, both for change and fortune, Then any you haue seene abroad. Men. Then any I haue obseru'd abroad: all Countries else To a free eye and mind yeeld something rare; And I for my part, haue brought home one Iewell Of admirable value. Ame. Iewell, Menaphon? Men. A Iewell, my Amethus, a faire Youth; A Youth, whom if I were but superstitious, I should repute an Excellence more high, Then meere creations are, to adde delight. I'le tell yee how I found him. Ame. Prethee doe. Men. Passing from Italy to Greece, the Tales Which Poets of an elder time haue fain'd To glorifie their Tempe, bred in me Desire of visiting that Paradise. To Thessaly I came, and liuing priuate, Without acquaintance of more sweet companions, Then the old In-mates to my loue, my thoughts; I day by day frequented silent Groues, And solitarie Walkes. One morning early Vide Fami. stradam. lib. 2. Prolus. 6. Acad. 2. Imitat. Claudian. This accident incountred me: I heard The sweetest and most rauishing contention, That Art of Nature euer were at strife in. Ame. I cannot yet conceiue, what you inferre By Art and Nature. Men. I shall soone resolue yee. A sound of musicke toucht mine eares, or rather Indeed intranc'd my soule: as I stole neerer, Inuited by the melody, I saw This Youth, this faire-fac'd Youth, vpon his Lute With straines of strange variety and harmony, Proclaiming (as it seem'd) so bold a challenge To the cleare Quiristers of the Woods, the Birds, That as they flockt about him, all stood silent, Wondring at what they heard. I wondred too. Ame. And so doe I, good,âon. Men. A Nightingale. Natures best skill'd Musicion vndertakes The challenge, and for euery seuerall straine The wel-shapt Youth could touch, she sung her down; He coo'd not run Diuision with more Art Vpon his quaking Instrument, then she, The Nightingale did with her various notes Reply too, for a voyce, and for a sound, Amethus, tis much easier to beleeue That such they were, then hope to heare againe. Amet. How did the Riuals part? Mena. You terme them rightly, For they were Riuals, and their Mistris harmony. Some time thus spent, the young man grew at last Into a pretty anger, that a bird Whom Art had neuer taught Cliffs, Moods, or Notes, Should vie with him for mastery, whose study Had busied many houres to perfit practise: To end the controuersie, in a rapture, Vpon his Instrument he playes so swiftly, So many voluntaries, and so quicke, That there was curiositie and cunning, Concord in discord, lines of diffring method Meeting in one full Center of delight. Amet. Now for the bird. Mena. The bird ordain'd to be Musicks first Martyr, stroue to imitate These seuerall sounds: which, when her warbling throat Fail'd in, for griefe, downe dropt she on his Lute, And brake her heart; it was the quaintest sadnesse, To see the Conquerour vpon her Hearse, To weepe a funerall Elegy of teares, That trust me (my Amethus) I coo'd chide Mine owne vnmanly weakenesse, that made me A fellow-mourner with him. Amet. I beleeue thee. Mena. He lookes vpon the trophies of his Art, Then sigh'd, then wip'd his eyes, then sigh'd, and cride, Alas poore creature: I will soone reuenge This cruelty vpon the Author of it; Henceforth this Lute guilty of innocent blood, Shall neuer more betray a harmelesse peace To an vntimely end: and in that sorrow, As he was pashing it against a tree, I suddenly stept in. Amet. Thou hast discourst A truth of mirth and pitie. Mena. I reprieu'd Th'intended execution with intreaties, And interruption: but (my Princely friend) It was not strange, the musicke of his hand Did ouer-match birds, when his voyce and beauty, Youth, carriage and discretion, must, from men Indu'd with reason, rauish admiration: From me they did. Amet. But is this miracle Not to be seene? Men. I won him by degrees To chuse me his Companion whence he is, Or who, as I durst modestly inquire, So gently hee would woo not to make knowne: Onely for reasons to himselfe reseru'd. He told me, that some remnant of his life Was to be spent in Trauaile; for his fortunes, They were nor meane, nor riotous, his friends Not publisht to the world, though not obscure: His Countrey, Athens; and his name, Parthenophill. Amet. Came he with you to Cyprus? Men. Willingly. The fame of our young melancholy Prince, Meleanders rare distractions, the obedience Of young Cleophila, Thamasta's glory, Your matchlesse friendship, and my desperate loue Preuail'd with him, and I haue lodg'd him priuately In Famagosta. Amet. Now th'art doubly welcome: I will not lose the sight of such a rarity For one part of my hopes. When d'ee intend To visit my great-spirited Sister. Mena. May I Without offence? Amet. Without offence? Parthenophill Shall find a worthy intertainement too. Thou art not still a coward. Mena. Shee's too excellent, And I too low in merit. Amet. Ile prepare A noble welcome. And (friend) ere we part, Vnloade to thee an ouer-charged heart. Exeunt. Enter Rhetius carelesly attyr'd. Rhet. I will not court the madnesse of the times, Nor fawne vpon the Riots that embalme Our wanton Gentry, to preserue the dust Of their affected vanities in coffins Of memorable shame; when Common-wealths Totter and reele from that nobilitie And ancient vertue, which renownes the great, Who steere the Helme of gouernment, while Mushrooms Grow vp, &amp; make new lawes to licence folly: Why should not I, a May-game, scorne the weight Of my sunke fortunes? snarle at the vices Which rot the Land, and without feare or wit Be mine owne Anticke? Tis a sport to liue When life is irkesome, if we will not hug Prosperity in others, and contemne Affliction in our selues. This Rule is certaine, âHe that pursues his safety from the Schoole âOf State, must learne to be mad man, or foole. Ambition, wealth, ease, I renounce the diuell That damns yee here on earth, or I will beâ Mine owne mirth, or mine owne tormentor,âSo, Enter Pelius. Here comes intelligence, a Buz o'the Court. Pel. Rhetias, I sought thee out to tell thee newes, New, excellent new newes. Cucolus, Sirra, That Gull, that young old Gull, is comming this way. Rhet. And thou art his forerunner? Pel. Prethee heare me: In stead of a fine guarded Page, We haue got him A Boy, trickt vp in neat and handsome Fashion; Perswaded him, that tis indeed a Wench; And he has entertain'd him, he does follow him, Carries his sword and buckler, waits on his trencher, Filles him his Wine, Tobacco, whets his knife, Lackeyes his letters, does what seruice else He would imploy his man in: being askt, Why he is so irregular in Courtship? His answer is, that since great Ladies vse Gentlemen Vshers to goe bare before them, He knowes no reason, but he may reduce The Courtiers to haue women waite on them, And he begins the fashion; he is laught at Most complementally. Thou't burst to see him. Rhet. Agelastus, so surnamed for his grauity, Was a very wise fellow, kept his countenance All dayes of his life as demurely, as a Iudge that Pronounceth sentence of death, on a poore Roague, For stealing as much bacon, as would serue at a meale With a Calues head. Yet he smil'd once, And neuer but once: Thou art no Scholler? Pel. I haue read Pamphlets dedicated to me: Dost call him Agelastus? why did he laugh? Rhet. To see an Asse eate Thistles. Puppy, go study to be a singular Coxcomb. Cuculus is an Ordinary Ape, but thou art an Ape of an Ape. Enter Cuculus and Grilla. Pel. Thou hast a Patent to abuse thy friends: Looke, looke, he comes, obserue him seriously. Cucul. Reach me my sword and buckler. Grill. They are here, forsooth. Cucul. How now (Minkes) how now? Where is your duty, your distance? Let me haue seruice methodically tendred; you are now One of vs. Your cursey; good: remember that you are To practise Courtship: was thy father a Piper, saist thou? Grill. A sounder of some such wind instrum?t forsooth. Cucull. Was he so? hold vp thy head; be thou musicall To me, and I will marry thee to a dancer: one That shall ryde on his Foot-cloth, and maintaine thee In thy Muffe and Hood. Grill. That will be fine indeed. Cucul. Thou art yet but simple. Grill. Dee thinke so? Cucul. I haue a braine; I haue a head-piece; O my conscience, if I take paines with thee, I shood Raise thy vnderstanding (Girle) to the height of a nurse, Or a Court-midwife at least, I will make thee big In time, wench. Grill. E'en doe your pleasure with me, Sir. Pel. Noble accomplisht Cuculus. Rhet. Giue me thy fist, Innocent. Cucul. Would 'twere in thy belly, there tis. Pel. That's well, hee's an honest blade, though he be blunt. Cucul. Who cares? we can be as blunt as he for's life. Rhet. Cuculus, there is within a mile or two, a Sow-pig Hath suckt a Brach, and now hunts the Deere, the Hare, Nay, most vnnaturally the wilde Bore, Aswell as any Hound in Cyprus. Cucul. Monstrous Sow-pig! ist true? Pel. Ile be at charge of a banket on thee for a sight of her. Rhet. Euery thing takes after the dam that gaue it suck: Where hadst thou thy milke? Cucul. I? Why, my nurses husband was a most excellent maker Of Shittle-cocks. Pel. My nurse was a woman-surgeon. Rhet. And who gaue thee pap, Mouse? Gril. I neuer suckt that I remember. Rhet. La now, a Shittle-cock-maker, all thy braines are stucke with corke and feather. Cuculus, this learned Courtier takes after the nurse too, a she-surgeon, which is in effect a meere matter of colours. Goe, learne to paint and dawbe complements, tis the next step to run into a new suit; my Lady Periwinckle here neuer suckt; suck thy Master, and bring forth Moone-calues, Fop, doe; This is good Philosophy, Sirs, make vse on't. Grill. Blesse vs, what a strange Creature this is? Cucul. A Gull, an arrant Gull by Proclamation. Enter Corax passing ouer. Pel. Corax, the Princes chiefe Physicion; What businesse speeds his hasteâ Are all things well, Sir? Cor. Yes, yes, yes. Rhet. Phew, you may wheele about, man, wee know y'are proud of your slouenry and practice, tis your vertue; the Princes melancholy fit I presume holds still. Cora. So doe thy knauery and desperate beggery. Cucul. Aha: here's one will tickle the ban-dog. Rhet. You must not goe yet. Cora. Ile stay in spight of thy teeth. There lyes my grauity: Casts off his gowne. Doe what thou darest, I stand thee. Rhet. Mountebanck, Empricks, Quacksaluers, Mineralists, Wizards, Alchimists, cast-Apothecaries, old Wiues and Barbers, are all suppositors to the right Worshipfull Doctor, as I take it. Some of yee are the head of your Art, &amp; the hornes too, but they come by nature, thou liuest single for no other end, but that thou fearest to be a Cuckold. Cora. Haue at thee; thou affect'st railing onely for thy health, thy miseries are so thicke and so lasting that thou hast not one poore denier to bestow on opening a veine. Wherefore to auoide a Plurisie, thou't be sure to prate thy selfe once a month into a whipping, and bleed in the breech in stead of the arme. Rhet. Haue at thee agen. Cora. Come. Cucul. There, there, there; O braue Doctor. Pel. Let 'em alone. Rhet. Thou art in thy Religion an Atheist, in thy condition a Curre, in thy dyet an Epicure, in thy lust a Goate, in thy sleepe a Hogge; thou tak'st vpon thee the habit of a graue Phisition, but art indeed an impostrous Emperike. Physicions are the bodies Coblers, rather the Botchers of mens bodies; as the one patches our tatterd clothes, so the other solders our diseased flesh. Come on. Cuc. Tot, tot, hold him tot, hold him toot, tot, tot, tot. Cora. The best worth in thee, is the corruption of thy minde, for that onely intitles thee to the dignity of a lowse: a thing bred out of the filth and superfluity of ill humours: Thou byt'st any where; and any man who defends not himselfe with the cleane linnen of secure honesty; him thou darest not come neere. Thou art Fortunes Ideot, Vertues Bankrupt, Times Dunghil, Manhoods Scandall, and thine owne scourge. Thou wouldst hang thy selfe, so wretchedly miserable thou art; but that no man will trust thee with as much money as will buy a halter: and all thy stocke to be sold, is not worth halfe as much as may procure it. Rhet. Ha, ha, ha; this is flattery, grosse flattery. Cora. I haue imployment for thee, and for yee all, Tut, these are but good morrowes betweene vs. Rhet. Are thy bottles full? Cor. Of rich wine, lets all sucke together. Rhet. Like so many Swine in a trough. Cora. Ile shape yee all for a deuise before the Prince, Wee'le trie how that can moue him. Rhet. He shall fret or laugh. Cucul. Must I make one? Cora. Yes, and your feminine Page too. Gril. Thankes most egregiously. Pel. I will not slacke my part. Cucul. Wench, take my buckler. Cora. Come all vnto my chamber, the proiect is cast, The time onely we must attend. Rhet. The melody must agree well, and yeeld sport, When such as these are, Knaues and Fooles consort. Exeunt. Enter Amethus, Thamasta and Kala. Amet. Does this shew well? Tham. What would you haue me doe? Amet. Not like a Lady of the trim, new crept Out of the shell of sluttish sweat and labour, Into the glittering pompe of ease and wantonnesse, Imbroideries, and all these antike fashions, That shape a woman monstrous; to transforme Your education, and a Noble birth Into contempt and laughter. Sister, Sister, She who deriues her blood from Princes, ought To glorifie her greatnesse by humility. Tham. Then you conclude me proud. Amet. Young Menaphon, My worthy friend, has lou'd you long, and truly, To witnesse his obedience to your scorne, Twelue moneths (wrong'd Gentleman) he vndertooke A voluntary exile. Wherefore (Sister) In this time of his absence, haue you not Dispos'd of your affections on some Monarch? Or sent Embassadors to some neighbouring King With fawning protestations of your graces? Your rare perfections, admirable beauty? This had been a new piece of modesty, Would haue deseru'd a Chronicle! Tham. You are bitter; And brother, by your leaue, not kindly wise. My freedome is my births, I am not bound To fancy your approuements, but my owne. Indeed you are an humble youth, I heare of Your visits, and your louing commendation To your hearts Saint, Cleophila, a Virgin Of a rare excellence: what though she want A portion to maintaine a portly greatnesse? Yet tis your gracious sweetnesse to descend So low, the meeknesse of your pity leades yee. She is your deare friends Sister, a good soule, An Innocent. Amet. Thamasta. Tham. I haue giuen Your Menaphon a welcome home as fits me; For his sake entertain'd Parthenophill, The handsome Stranger, more familiarly Then (I may feare) becomes me; yet for his part, I not repent my courtesies, but youâ Amet. No more, no more; be affable to both: Time may reclaime your cruelty. Tham. I pitty The youth, and trust me (brother) loue his sadnesse: He talkes the prettiest stories, he deliuers His tales so gracefully, that I coo'd sit And listen, nay forget my meales and sleepe, To heare his neat discourses. Menaphon Was well aduis'd in chusing such a friend, For pleading his true loue. Amet. Now I commend thee, Thou't change at last, I hope. Enter Menaphon and Eroclea in mans attire. Tham. I feare I shall. Amet. Haue ye suruaid the Garden? Men. Tis a curious, A pleasantly contriu'd delight. Tham. Your eye (Sir) Hath in your trauailes, often met contents Of more variety. Eroc. Not any (Lady.) Men. It were impossible, since your faire presence Makes euery place where it vouchsafes to shine, More louely then all other helpes of Art Can equall. Tham. What you meane by helpes of Art, You know your selfe best, be they as they are: You need none I am sure to set me forth. Men. 'Twould argue want of manners, more then skill, Not to praise praise itselfe. Tham. For your reward, Henceforth Ile call you Seruant. Amet. Excellent Sister. Men. 'Tis my first step to honour: May I fall Lower then shame, when I neglect all seruice That may confirme this fauour. Tham. Are you well, Sir? Eroc. Great Princesse, I am well, to see a League Betweene an humble loue, such as my Friends is, And a commanding vertue, such as yours is, Are sure restoratiues. Tham. You speake ingeniously. Brother, be pleas'd to shew the Gallery To this young stranger, vse the time a while, And we will altogether to the Court. I will present yee (Sir) vnto the Prince. Eroc. Y'are all compos'd of fairenesse, and true bounty. Amet. Come, come, wee'l wait thee, Sister: this beginning Doth rellish happy processe. Mena. You haue blest me. Exeunt all but Thamasta and Kala. Tham. Kala, O Kala, Kala. Lady. Tham. We are priuate, thou art my Closet. Kala. Locke your secrets close then: I am not to be forc'd. Tham. Neuer till now, Coo'd I be sensible of being traytor To honour and to shame. Kala. You are in loue. Tham. I am growne baseâParthenophillâ Kala. Hee's handsome, Richly indow'd; he hath a louely face, A winning tongue. Tham. If euer I must fall, In him my greatnesse sinkes. Loue is a Tyrant Resisted; whisper in his eare, how gladly I would steale time, to talke with him one houre; But doe it honourably; preth'ee Kala Doe not betray me. Kala. Madame, I will make it Mine owne case; he shall thinke I am in loue with him. Tham. I hope thou art not Kala. Kala. Tis for your sake: Ile tell him so; but Faith I am not, Lady. Tham. Pray vse me kindly; let me not too soone Be lost in my new follyes. Tis a Fate That ouer-rules our wisdomes, whil'st we striue To liue most free, wee'r caught in our owne toyles. Diamonds cut Diamonds: they who will proue To thriue in cunning, must cure loue with loue. Exit. Finis Actus Primi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus II. Scena I. Enter Sophronos and Aretus. Sophronos. Ovr Common-wealth is sick: tis more then time That wee should wake the Head thereof, who sleepes In the dull Lethargy of lost security. The Commons murmur, and the Nobles grieue, The Court is now turn'd Anticke, and growes wilde, Whiles all the neighb'ring Nations stand at gaze, And watch fit oportunity, to wreake Their iust conceiued fury, on such iniuries, As the late Prince, our liuing Masters Father, Committed against Lawes of truth or honour. Intelligence comes flying in on all sides, Whilest the vnsteady multitude presume, How that you, Aretus, and I, ingrosse (Out of particular Ambition) Th'affaires of gouernment, which I for my part, Groane vnder, and am weary of. Aret. Sophronos, I am as zealous too of shaking of My gay State fetters, that I haue bethought Of speedy remedy; and to that end As I haue told yee, haue concluded with Corax, the Princes chiefe Physician. Soph. You should haue done this sooner, Aretus; You were his Tutor, and could best discerne His dispositions to informe them rightly. Aret. Passions of violent nature, by degrees Are easili'st reclaim'd. There's something hid Of his distemper, which wee'l now find out. Enter Corax, Rhetias, Pelias, Cuculus and Grilla. You come on iust appointment: welcome, Gentlemen, Haue you won Rhetias (Corax?) Cora. Most sincerely. Cucul. Saue yee, Nobilities: doe your Lordships take notice of my Page? Tis a fashion of the newest edition, spick and span new, without example. Doe your honour, Houswife. Grill. There's a cursey for you, and a cursey for you. Soph. Tis excellent: we must all follow fashion, and entertaine Shee-waiters. Aret. 'Twill be Courtly. Cucul. I thinke so; I hope the Chronicles will reare me one day for a head-pieceâ Rhet. Of Woodcocke without braines in't; Barbers shall weare thee on their Citternes, and Hucksters set thee out in Ginger-bread. Cucul. Deuill take thee: I say nothing to thee now; canst let me be quiet? Gril. Y'are too perstreperous, Sauce-box. Cucul. Good Girle, if we begin to puffe once. Pel. Prethee hold thy tongue, the Lords are in the presence. Rhet. Mum, Butterflye. Pel. O the Prince: stand and keepe silence. Cucul. O the Prince: Wench, thou shalt see the Prince now. Soft Musicke. Enter Pallador, the Prince, with a Booke in his hand. Soph., Aret. Sir; Gracious Sir. Prince. Why all this Company? Cora. A Booke! is this the early exercise I did prescribe? in stead of following health, Which all m? couet, you pursue your disease. Where's your great Horse, your Hounds, your set at Tennis, Your Balloone ball, the practice of your dancing, Your casting of the sledge, or learning how To tosse a Pike; all chang'd into a Sonnet? Pray Sir grant me free liberty to leaue The Court, it do's infect me with the sloth Of sleepe and surfet: In the Vniuersity I haue imployments, which to my profession Adde profit and report: Here I am lost, And in your wilfull dulnesse held a man Of neither Art nor honesty: you may Command my head; pray take it, doe; 'twere better For me to lose it, then to lose my wits, And liue in Bedlam: you will force me too't, I am almost mad already. Prince. I beleeue it. Soph. Letters are come from Creete, which do require A speedy restitution of such ships, As by your Father were long since detain'd; If not; defiance threatned. Aret. These neere parts Of Syria that adioyne, muster their friends: And by intelligence we learne for certaine, The Syrian will pretend an ancient interest Of tribute intermitted. Soph. Through your Land Your subiects mutter strangely, and imagine More then they dare speake publikely. Cora. And yet They talke but odly of you. Cucul. Hang 'em Mungrels. Prince. Of me? my subiects talke of me? Cora. Yes, scuruily, And thinke worse (Prince.) Prince. Ile borrow patience A little time to listen to these wrongs, And from the few of you which are here present, Conceiue the generall voyce. Cora. So, now he is nettled. Prince. By all your loues I charge ye, without feare Or flattery, to let me know your thoughts, And how I am interpreted: Speake boldly. Soph. For my part (Sir) I will be plaine, and briefe: I thinke you are of Nature milde and easie, Not willingly prouokt, but withall head-strong In any passion that misleades your Iudgement. I thinke you too indulgent to such motions, As spring out of your owne affections, To old to be reform'd, and yet too young To take fit councell from your selfe, of what Is most amisse. Prince. SoâTutor, your conceit? Aret. I think you doate (with pardon let me speak it) Too much vpon your pleasures, and these pleasures Are so wrapt vp in selfe-loue, that you couet No other change of fortune: would be still What your birth makes you, but are loth to toyle In such affaires of State as breake your sleepes. Cora. I thinke you would be by the world, reputed A man in euery point compleat, but are In manners and effect indeed a childe, A boy, a very boy. Pel. May it please your Grace, I thinke you doe containe within your selfe The great Elixer, soule and quintessence Of all diuine perfections: are the glory Of mankind, and the onely strict example For earthly Monarchies to square out their liues by: Times miracle, Fames pride, in Knowledge, Wit, Sweetnesse, Discourse, Armes, Artsâ Prince. You are a Courtier. Cucul. But not of the ancient fashion, an't like your Highnesse. Tis I; I, that am the credit of the Court, Noble Prince: and if thou would'st by Proclamation or Patent, create me Ouerseer of all the Taylers in thy Dominions; then, then the golden dayes should appeare againe; bread should be cheaper; fooles should haue more wit; knaues more honesty; and beggers more money. Gril. I thinke nowâ Cucul. Peace you Squall. Prince. You haue not spoken yet. Cucul. Hang him, hee'l nothing but raile. Gril. Most abominable: out vpon him. Cora. Away Cuculus; follow the Lords. Cucul. Close Page, close. They all fall backe, and steale out. Manet Prince and Rhetias. Prince. You are somewhat long a thinking. Rhet. I doe not thinke at all. Prince. Am I not worthy of your thought? Rhet. My pitty you areâ But not my reprehension. Prince. Pitty? Rhet. Yes, for I pitty such to whom I owe seruice, who exchange their happinesse for a misery. Prince. Is it a misery to be a Prince? Rhet. Princes who forget their soueraignty, and yeeld to affected passion, are weary of command. You had a Father, Sir. Prince. Your Soueraigne whiles he liu'd. But what of him? Rhet. Nothing. I onely dar'd to name him; that's all. Prince. I charge thee by the duty that thou ow'st vs, be plaine in what thou meanest to speake: there's something that we must know: be free, our eares are open. Rhet. O Sir, I had rather hold a Wolfe by the eares, then stroake a Lyon, the greatest danger is the last. Prince. This is meere triflingâHa? are all stollen hence? We are alone: Thou hast an honest looke, Thou hast a tongue, I hope, that is not oyld With flattery. Be open, though tis true, That in my younger dayes I oft haue heard Agenors name, my Father, more traduc'd, Then I could then obserue; yet I protest, I neuer had a friend, a certaine friend, That would informe me throughly of such errors, As oftentimes are incident to Princes. Rhet. All this may be. I haue seene a man so curious in feeling of the edge of a keene knife, that he has cut his fingers. My flesh is not of proofe against the metall I am to handle; the one is tenderer then the other. Prince. I see then I must court thee. Take the word Of a iust Prince for any thing thou speakest. I haue more then a Pardon, thankes and loue. Rhet. I will remember you of an old Tale that somthing concernes you. Meleander, the great (but vnfortunate Statesman, was by your Father treated with for a Match betweene you and his eldest daughter, the Lady Eroclea. You were both neere of an age. I presume you remember a Contract, and cannot forget Her. Prince. She was a louely beauty: Prethee forward. Rhet. To Court was Eroclea brought, was courted by your Father, not for Prince Palador, as it followed, but to be made a prey to some lesse noble designe.â With your fauour I haue forgot the rest. Prince. Good call it backe agen into thy memory, Else losing the remainder, I am lost too. Rhet. You charme me. In briefe, a Rape, by some bad Agents, was attempted; by the Lord Meleander her father rescude, she conuay'd away, Meleander accus'd of treason, his Land seized, he himselfe distracted and confined to the Castle where he yet liues. What had ensude was doubtfull. But your Father shortly after dyed. Prince. But what became of faire Eroclea? Rhet. She neuer since was heard of. Prince. No hope liues then Of euer, euer seeing her againe. Rhet. Sir, I feare I should anger yee. There was, as I said, an old Tale; I haue now a new one, which may perhaps season the first with a more delightfull rellish. Prince. I am prepar'd to heare, say what you please. Rhet. My Lord Meleander falling, on whose fauour my fortunes relyde, I furnisht my selfe for trauaile, and bent my course to Athens, where a pretty accident after a while came to my knowledge. Prince. My eare is open to thee. Rhet. A young Lady contracted to a noble Gentleman, as the Lady we last mentioned, and your Highnes were, being hindred by their iarring Parents, stole from her home, and was conueyed like a Ship-boy in a Merchant, from the Countrey where she liu'd, into Corinth first, and afterwards to Athens; where in much solitarinesse she liu'd like a Youth almost two yeeres, courted by all for acquaintance, but friend to none by familiaritie. Prince. In habit of a man? Rhet. A handsome young man, till within these three moneths, or lesse, her sweet hearty Father dying some yeere before, or more, shee had notice of it, and with much ioy returned home, and as report voyced it, at Athens enioyed her happinesse: she was long an exile: For now Noble Sir, if you did loue the Lady Eroclea, why may not such safety and fate direct her, as directed the other? tis not impossible. Prince. If I did loue her, Rhetias: yes I did. Giue me thy hand: As thou didst serue Meleander, And art still true to these, henceforth serue me. Rhet. My duty and my obedience are my suretie, But I haue been too bold. Prince. Forget the sadder story of my Father, And onely Rhetias, learne to reade me well, For I must euer thanke thee; th'ast vnlockt A tongue was vow'd to silence, for requitall Open my bosome, Rhetias. Rhet. What's your meaning? Prince. To tye thee to an oath of secrecyâ Vnloose the buttons, man, thou dost it faintly, What findst thou there? Rhet. A picture in a Tablet. Prince. Looke well vpon't. Rhet. I doeâyesâlet me obserue itâ Tis hers, the Ladies. Prince. Whose! Rhet. Erocleas. Prince. Hers that was once Eroclea: for her sake Haue I aduanst Sophronos to the Helme Of gouernment; for her sake will restore Meleanders Honours to him; will for her sake Beg friendship from thee, Rhetias. O be faithfull, And let no politicke Lord worke from thy bosome My griefes: I know thou wert put on to sift me: But be not too secure. Rhet. I am your Creature. Prince. Continue still thy discontented fashion: Humour the Lords, as they would humour me; Ile not liue in thy debt.âWe are discouer'd. Enter Amethus, Menaphon, Thamasta, Kala, Eroclea, as before. Amet. Honour and health still wait vpon the Prince. Sir, I am bold with fauour to present Vnto your Highnes, Menaphon my friend, Return'd from trauaile. Mena. Humbly on my knees I kisse your gracious hand. Prince. It is our duty To loue the vertuous. Mena. If my prayers or seruice Holdâany value, they are vow'd yours euer. Rhet. I haue a fist for thee too (Strippling) th'art started vp prettily since I saw thee. Hast learned any wit abroad? Canst tell newes, and sweare lyes with a grace like a true Traueller? What new Owzle's this? Tham. Your Highnesse shall doe right to your owne iudgement, In taking more then common notice of This stranger, an Athenian, nam'd Parthenophill. One, (whom if mine opinion doe not sooth me Too grossely) for the fashion of his minde, Deserues a deare respect. Prince. Your commendations, Sweet Cousin, speakes him Nobly. Eroc. All the powers That centinell iust Thrones, double these guards About your sacred Excellence. Prince. What fortune led him to Cyprus! Men. My perswasions won him. Amet. And if your Highnesse please to heare the entrance Into their first aquaintance, you will sayâ Tham. It was the newest, sweetest, prettiest accident, That ere delighted your attention. I can discourse it, Sir. Prince. Some other time. How is a cald? Tham. Parthenophill. Prince. Parthenophill? Wee shall sort time to take more notice of him. Exit. Prince. Men. His wonted melancholy still pursues him. Amet. I told you so. Tham. You must not wonder at it. Eroc. I doe not, Lady. Amet. Shall we to the Castle? Men. Wee will attend yee both. Rhet. All threeâIle goe too. Hark in thine eare, Gallant: Ile keep the old mad man in chat, whilest thou gabblest to the girle: my thumb's vpon my lips, not a word. Amet. I neede not feare thee, Rhetias.âSister, soone Expect vs: this day wee will range the City. Tham. Well, soone I shall expect yee.âKala? Kala. Trust mee. Rhet. Troope onâLoue, Loue, what a wonder thou art? Exeunt. Kala and Eroclea stayes. Kala. May I not be offensiue, Sir? Ero. Your pleasure; yet pray be briefe. Kala. Then briefly, good, resolue mee: Haue you a Mistris, or a Wife? Ero. I haue neither. Kala. Nor did you euer loue in earnest any Faire Lady, whom you wisht to make your owne? Ero. Not any truly. Kala. What your friends or meanes are I will not be inquisitiue to know, Nor doe I care to hope for. But admit A dowre were throwne downe before your choyce, Of Beauty, Noble birth, and sincere affection, How gladly would you intertaine it? (Young man) I doe not tempt you idly. Ero. I shall thanke you, When my vnsettled thoughts can make me sensible Of what tis to be happy: for the present I am your debtor: and faire Gentlewoman, Pray giue me leaue as yet to study ignorance, For my weake braines conceiue not what concerne me. âAnother time.â Enter Thamasta. Tham. Doe I breake off your Parley That you are parting? Sure my woman loues you. Can she speake well, Parthenophill? Ero. Yes, Madame: Discreetly chaste she can: she hath much won On my beliefe, and in few words, but pithy, Much moou'd my thankfulnesse. You are her Lady, Your goodnesse aimes (I know) at her preferment: Therefore I may be bold to make confession Of truth, if euer I desire to thriue In womans fauour. Kala is the first Whom my ambition shall bend to. Tham. Indeed. But say a Nobler Loue should interpose? Eroc. Where reall worth, and constancy first settle A hearty truth, there greatnesse cannot shake it, Nor shall it mine: yet I am but an Infant In that construction, which must giue cleare light To Kala's merit: riper houres hereafter Must learne me how to grow rich in deserts. Madame, my duty waits on you. Exit Eroclea. Tham. Come hither. If euer henceforth I desire to thriue In womans fauours, Kala is the first Whom my ambition shall bend toâ'twas so. Kal. These very words he spake. Tham. These very words Curse thee, vnfaithfull creature, to thy graue: Thou wood'st him for thy selfe? Kala. You said I should. Tham. My name was neuer mentioned! Kala. Madame, no: We were not come to that. Tham. Not come to that? Art thou a Riuall fit to crosse my Fate? Now pouerty and a dishonest fame, The waiting-womans wages, be thy payment. False, faithlesse, wanton beast, Ile spoile your carriage; There's not a Page, a Groome, nay, not a Citizen That shall be cast vpon yee. Kala, Ile keepe thee in my seruice all thy life time, Without hope of a husband or a suter. Kala. I haue not verily deseru'd this cruelty. Tham. Parthenophill shall know, if he respect My birth, the danger of a fond neglect. Exit Tham. Kala. Are you so quick? Well, I may chance to crosse Your peeuishnesse. Now though I neuer meant The young man for my selfe; yet if he loue me, Ile haue him, or Ile run away with him, And let her doe her worst then: what, we are all But flesh and blood; the same thing that will doe My Lady good, will please her woman too. Exit. Enter Cleophila and Trollio. Cleo. Tread softly (Trollio) my Father sleepes still. Troll. I forsooth: but he sleepes like a Hare with his eyes open, and that's no good signe. Cleo. Sure thou art weary of this sullen liuing, But I am not; for I take more content In my obedience here, then all delights The time presents elsewhere. Menander within. Oh! Cleo. Do'st heare that groane? Troll. Heare it? I shudder, it was a strong blast, young Mistris, able to roote vp heart, liuer, lungs and all. Cleo. My much-wrong'd Father: let me view his face. Drawes the Arras, Meleander discouered in a chaire sleeping. Troll. Lady Mistris, shall I fetch a Barbour to steale away his rough beard, whiles he sleepes in's naps? He neuer lookes in a glasse, and tis high time on conscience for him to bee trimd, has not been vnder the Shauers hand almost these foure yeeres. Cleo. Peace, foole. Trol. I could clip the old Ruffian, there's haire enough to stuffe all the great Codpieces in Switzerland. A begins to stirre, a stirres. Blesse vs how his eyes rowle. A good yeere keepe your Lordship in your right wits, I beseech yee. Mel. Cleophila? Cleo. Sir, I am here, how d'ee Sir? Troll. Sir, is your stomacke vp yet? get some warme porredge in your belly, 'tis a very good settle-braine. Mel. The Rauen croakt, and hollow shreeks of Owles Sung Dirges at her funerall; I laugh'd The whiles: for twas no boot to weepe. The Girle Was fresh and full of youth: but, O the cunning Of Tyrants that looke bigge, their very frownes Doome poore soules guilty, ere their cause be heard. Good. What art thou, and thou? Cleo. I am Cleophila, Your wofull daughter. Troll. I am Trollia your honest implement. Mel. I know yee both. 'las, why d'ee vse me thus! Thy Sister, my Eroclea, was so gentle, That Turtles in their Downe doe feed more gall, Then her spleene mixt with: yet when winds and storme Driue dirt and dust on banks of spotlesse snow, The purest whitenesse is no such defence Against the sullying foulenesse of that fury. So rau'd Agenor, that great man, mischiefe Against the Girleâ'twas a politick tricke, We were too old in Honour.âI am leane And falne away extremely; most assuredly I haue not dyn'd these three dayes. Cleo. Will you now, Sir? Troll. I beseech yee heartily Sir. I feele a horrible puking my selfe. Mel. Am I starke mad? Troll. No, no, you are but a little staring.âthere's difference betweene staring and starke mad. You are but whymsed, yet crotchetted, conundroun'd, or so. Mel. Here's all my care: and I doe often sigh For thee, Cleophyla: we are secluded From all good people. But take heed, Amethus Was sonne to Doryla, Agenors Sister. There's some ill blood about him, if the Surgeon Haue not been very skilfull to let all out. Cleo. I am (alas) too grieu'd to thinke of loue, That must concerne me least. Mel. Sirra, be wise, be wise. Enter Amethus, Menaphon, Eroclea (as before) and Rhetias. Troll. Who I? I will be monstrous and wise immediately. Welcome, Gentlemen, the more the merrier, Ile lay the cloth, and set the stooles in a readinesse, for I see here is some hope of dinner now. Exit Trollio. Amet. My Lord Meleander, Menaphon your Kinsman Newly return'd from trauaile, comes to tender His duty t'ee: to you his loue, faire Mistris. Men. I would I could as easily remoue Sadnesse from your remembrance, Sir, as study To doe you faithfull seruiceâmy deare Cousin, All best of comforts blesse your sweet obedience. Clo. One chiefe of 'em (worthy Cousin) liues In you, and your well-doing. Men. This young stranger Will well deserue your knowledge. Amet. For my friends sake, Lady pray giue him welcome. Cleo. He has met it, if sorrowes can looke kindly. Eroc. You much honour me. Rhet. How a eyes the company: sure my passion will betray my weakenesseâO my Master, my Noble Master, doe not forget me, I am still the humblest, and the most faithfull in heart of those that serue you. Mel. Ha, ha, ha. Rhet. There's wormewood in that laughter, tis the vsher to a violent extremity. Mel. I am a weake old man. All these are come To ieere my ripe calamities. Mena. Good Vncle! Mel. But Ile out-stare 'ee all, fooles, desperate fooles, You are cheated, grossely cheated, range, range on, And rowle about the world to gather mosse, The mosse of honour, gay reports, gay clothes, Gay wiues, huge empty buildings, whose proud roofes, Shall with their pinacles, euen reach the starres. Ye worke and worke like Moles, blind in the paths, That are bor'd through the crannies of the earth, To charge your hungry soules with such full surfets, As being gorg'd once, make 'ee leane with plenty. And when ye haue skimd the vomit of your riots, Y'are fat in no felicity but folly, Then your last sleepes seize on 'ee. Then the troopes Of wormes crawle round, &amp;, feast, good cheare, rich fare, Dainty deliciousâhere's Cleophyla: All the poore stocke of my remaining thrift; You, you, the Princes Cousin: how d'ee like her? (Amethus) how d'ee like her? Amet. My intents are iust and honourable. Men. Sir, beleeue him. Mel. Take her.âwe two must part, go to him, doe. Ero. This sight is full of horror. Rhet. This is sence yet in this distraction. Mel. In this Iewell I haue giuen away, All what I can call mine. When I am dead, Saue charge; let me be buried in a nooke. No guns, no pompous whining: these are fooleries. If whiles we liue, we stalke about the streets, Iustled by Carmen, Foot-poasts, and fine Apes, In silken coates, vnminded, and scarce thought on; It is not comely to be hal'd to the earth, Like high fed lades vpon a Tilting-day, In antique trappings: scorne to vse-lesse teares. Eroclea was not coffind so: she perisht, And no eye dropt saue mine, and I am childish. I talke like one that doates; laugh at me, Rhetias, Or raile at me: they will not giue me meate: They haue staru'd me: but Ile henceforth be mine owne Cook. Good morrow: tis too early for my cares To reuell. I will breake my heart a little, And tell yee more hereafter. Pray be merry. Exit Meleander. Rhet. Ile follow him. My Lord Amethus, vse your time Respectiuely. Few words to purpose soon'st preuaile: Study no long Orations; be plaine and short, Ile follow him. Exit Rhetias. Amet. Cleophyla, although these blacker clouds Of sadnes, thicken and make darke the sky Of thy faire eyes, yet giue me leaue to follow The streame of my affections: they are pure, Without all mixture of vnnoble thoughts. Can you be euer mine? Cleo. I am so low In mine owne fortunes, and my Fathers woes, That I want words to tell yee, you deserue A worthier choice. Amet. But giue me leaue to hope. Men. My friend is serious. Cleo. Sir, this for answer: If I euer thriue In an earthly happinesse, the next To my good Fathers wisht recouery, Must be my thankfulnesse to your great merit; Which I dare promise for the present time: You cannot vrge more from me. Mel. Ho, Cleophyla? Cleo. This Gentleman is moou'd. Ame. Your eyes, Parthenophill, Are guilty of some passion. Men. Friend, what ailes thee? Eroc. All is not well within me, Sir. Meleander within. Cleophyla? Ame. Sweet Maid, forget me not; we now must part. Cleo. Still you shall haue my prayer. Ame. Still you my truth. Exeunt omnes. Finis Actus secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus III. Scena I. Enter Cuculus and Grilla, Cuculus in a blacke veluet Cap, and a white Feather, with a paper in his hand. Cuculus. Doe not I looke freshly, and like a Youth of the Trim? Gril. As rare an old Youth as euer walkt crosse-gartered. Cucul. Here are my Mistrisses mustred in white and blacke. Kala the Waiting-woman. I will first begin at the soote: stand thou for Kala. Gril. I stand for Kala, doe your best and your worst. Cucul. I must looke bigge, and care little or nothing for her, because shee is a creature that stands at liuery. Thus I talke wisely, and to no purpose. Wench, as it is not fit that thou should'st be either faire or honest; so considering thy seruice, thou art as thou art, and so are thy betters, let them bee what they can bee. Thus in despite and defiance of all thy good parts, if I cannot indure thy basenesse, tis more out of thy courtesie, then my deseruing, and so I expect thy answer. Grill. I must confesseâ Cucul. Well said. Gril. You areâ Cucul. That's true too. Gril. To speake you right, a very scuruy fellow.â Cucul. Away, away, do'st thinke so? Grill. A very foule-mouth'd, and misshapen Cockscombe. Cucul. Ile neuer beleeue it by this hand. Grill. A Magot, most vnworthy to creepe inâ âTo the least wrinckle of a Gentlewomans (What d'ee call) good conceit, or so, or what You will else.âWere you not refin'd by Courtship And education, which in my bleare eyes Makes you appeare as sweet as any nosegay, Or sauory cod of Muske new fall'n from th'Cat. Cucul. This shall serue well enough for the Waiting-woman. My next Mistris is Cleophyla, the old mad-mans daughter: I must come to her in whining tune, sigh, wipe mine eyes, fold my Armes, and blubber out my speech as thus: Euen as a Kennell of Hounds (sweet Lady) cannot catch a Hare, when they are full pauncht on the Carrion of a dead Horse: so, euen so the gorge of my affections being full cramm'd with the garboyles of your condolements, doth tickle me with the prick (as it were) about mee, and fellow-feeling of howling outright. Grill. This will doo't, if we will heare. Cucul. Thou seest I am crying ripe, I am such another tender-hearted foole. Grill. Euen as the snuffe of a candle that is burnt in the socket, goes out, and leaues a strong perfume behind it; or as a piece of toasted cheese next the heart in a morning is a restoratiue for a sweet breath: so, euen so the odoriferous sauour of your loue doth perfume my heart, (Hay ho) with the pure sent of an intolerable content, and not to be indur'd. Cucul. By this hand tis excellent. Haue at thee last of all: for the Princesse Thamasta, she that is my Mistris indeed, she is abominably proud. A Lady of a damnable, high, turbulent, and generous spirit. But I haue a loud-mouth'd Cannon of mine owne to batter her, and a pen'd speech of purpose; obserue it. Grill. Thus I walke by, heare and minde you not. Cucul. Though haughty as the Diuell or his Dam, Thou dost appeare, great Mistris: yet I am Like to an vgly fire-worke, and can mount Aboue the Region of thy sweet Acâcount. Wert thou the Moone her selfe, yet hauing seene thee, Behold the man ordain'd to mooue within thee. âLooke to your selfe, Houswife; answer me In strong Lines y'are best. Gril. Keepe off, poore foole, my beames will strike thee blinde: Else if thou touch me, touch me but behind. In Palaces, such as passe in before, Must be great Princes; for at the backe dore Tatter-demallains waite, who know not how To get admittance: such a oneâart Thou. Cucul. S'foot, this is downe-right roaring. Grill. I know how to present a big Lady in her owne cue. But pray in earnest, are you in loue with all these? Cucul. Pish, I haue not a ragge of loue about me. Tis only a foolish humour I am possest with, to be surnam'd the Conquerour. I will court any thing; be in loue with nothing, nor noâthing. Grill. A rare man you are, I protest. Cucul. Yes, I know I am a rare man, and I euer held my selfe so. Enter Pelias and Corax. Pel. In amorous contemplation on my life; Courting his Page by Helicon. Cucul. Tis false. Grill. A grosse vntruth; Ile iustifie it, Sir, At any time, place, weapon. Cucul. Marry shall she. Cora. No quarrels, good'ee Whiske. Lay by your Trumperies, and fall to your practice. Instructions are ready for you all. Pelias is your Leader, follow him. Get credit now or neuer. Vanish, Doodles, vanish. Cucul. For the Deuice. Cora. The same, get'ee gone, and make no bawling. Exeunt. To waste my time thus Droane-like in the Court, And lose so many houres, as my studies Haue horded vp, is to be like a man That creepes both on his hands and knees, to climbe A mountaines top, where when he is ascended, One carelesse slip downe, tumbles him againe Into the bottome whence a first began. I need no Princes fauour: Princes need My Art. Then Corax, be no more a Gull, The best of'em cannot foole thee, nay, they shall not. Enter Sophronos and Aretus. Soph. We find him timely now, let's learne the cause. Aret. Tis fit we shouldâSir, we approue you learn'd, And since your skill can best discerne the humours That are predominant, in bodies subiect To alteration: tell vs (pray) what diuell This Melancholy is, which can transforme Men into Monsters. Cora. Y'ar your selfe a Scholer, And quicke of apprehension: Melancholy Is not as you conceiue. Indisposition Of body, but the mindes disease. So Extasie, Fantastick Dotage, Madnesse, Phrenzey, Rupture, Of meere imagination differ partly Vid. Democrit. Iunior.From Melancholy, which is briefly this, A meere commotion of the minde, o're-charg'd With feare and sorrow; first begot i'th' braine, The Seate of Reason, and from thence deriu'd As suddenly into the Heart, the Seate Of our Affection. Aret. There are sundry kinds Of this disturbance. Cora. Infinite, it were More easie to coniecture euery houre We haue to liue, then reckon vp the kinds, Or causes of this anguish of the minde. Soph. Thus you conclude, that as the cause is doubtfull, The cure must be impossible; and then Our Prince (poore Gentleman) is lost for euer, As well vnto himselfe, as to his subiects. Cora. My Lord, you are too quick; thus much I dare Promise, and doe, ere many minutes passe, I will discouer whence his sadnesse is, Or vndergoe the censure of my ignorance. Aret. You are a Noble Scholer. Soph. For reward, You shall make your owne demand. Cora. May I be sure? Aret. We both will pledge our truth. Cora. Tis soone perform'd, That I may be discharg'd from my attendance At Court, and neuer more be sent for after: Or if I be, may Rats gnaw all my bookes, If I get home once, and come here againe, Though my necke stretch a halter for't, I care not. Soph. Come, come, you shall not feare it. Cora. Ile acquaint yee With what is to be done, and you shall fashion it. Exeunt omnes. Enter Kala and Eroclea, as before. Kala. My Lady do's expect'ee, thinks all time Too slow till you come to her: wherefore young man, If you intend to loue me, and me onely, Before we part, without more circumstance Let vs betroth ourselues. Eroc. I dare not wrong'ee; You are too violent. Kala. Wrong me no more Then I wrong you: be mine, and I am yours: I cannot stand on points. Eroc. Then to resolue All further hopes, you neuer can be mine, Must not, (and pardon though I say) you shall not. Kala. The thing is sure a GeldingâShal not? well, Y'are best to prate vnto my Lady now, What proffer I haue made. Eroc. Neuer, I vow. Kala. Doe, doe, tis but a kind heart of mine owne, And ill lucke can vndoe me.âBe refus'd? Of sciruy.âPray walke on, Ile ouertake'ee. What a greene sicknesse-liuer'd Boy is this! Exit Ero. My Maiden-head will shortly grow so stale, That 'twill be mouldy: but Ile marre her market. Enter Menaphon. Men. Parthenophill past the way; prethee Kala Direct me to him. Kala. Yes, I can direct'ee: But you (Sir) must forbeare. Men. Forbeare! Kala. I said so. Your bounty h'as ingag'd my truth; receiue A secret, that will, as you are a man, Startle your Reason: tis but meere respect Of what I owe to thankfulnesse. (Deare Sir) The Stranger whom your courtesie receiued For Friend, is made your Riuall. Men. Riuall, Kala. Take heed, thou art too credulous. Kala. My Lady Doates on him: I will place you in a roome, Where, though you cannot heare, yet you shall see Such passages as will confirme the truth Of my intelligence. Men. Twill make me mad. Kala. Yes, yes: it makes me mad too, that a Gentleman So excellently sweet, so liberall, So kind, so proper, should be so betray'd By a young smooth-chind straggler: but for loues sake Beare all with manly courage.âNot a word, I am vndone then. Mena. That were too much pity: Honest, most honest Kala; tis thy care, Thy seruiceable care. Kal. You haue euen spoken all can be said or thought. Men. I will reward thee: But as for him, vngentle Boy, Ile whip His falshood with a vengeance.â Kala. O speake little. Walke vp these staires, and take this key, it opens A Chamber doore, where at that window yonder, You may see all their courtship. Men. I am silent. Exit Menap. Kala. As little noyse as may be, I beseech yee; There is a backe-staire to conuey yee forth Vnseene or vnsuspected.âHe that cheates A Waiting-woman of a free good turne She longs for, must expect a shrewd reuenge. Sheepe-spirited Boy, although he had not married me, He might haue proferd kindnesse in a corner, And ne'er haue been the worse for't. They are come; On goes my set of Faces most demurely. Enter Thamasta and Eroclea. Tham. Forbeare the roome. Kala. Yes, Madame. Tham. Whosoeuer requires accesse to me, deny him entrance till I call thee, and wait without. Kala. I shall. Sweet Venus, turne his courage to a Snow-ball, I heartily beseech it. Exit. Tham. I expose The Honour of my Birth, my Fame, my Youth, To hazard of much hard construction, In seeking an aduenture of a parley So priuate with a Stranger; if your thoughts Censure me not with mercy, you may soone Conceiue, I haue laid by that modesty, Which should preserue a vertuous name vnstain'd. Eroc. Lady, to shorten long excuses; time And safe experience haue so throughly arm'd My apprehension, with a reall taste Of your most Noble nature, that to question The least part of your bounties, or that freedome Which Heauen hath with a plenty made you rich in, Would argue me vnciuill, which is more, Base-bred, and which is most of all, vnthankefull. Tham. The constant Loadstone, and the Steele are found In seuerall Mines: yet is there such a league Betweene these Minerals, as if one Veine Of earth had nourisht both. The gentle Mirtle Is not ingraft vpon an Oliues stocke: Yet nature hath betweene them lockt a secret Of Sympathy, that being planted neere, They will both in their branches, and their rootes Imbrace each other; twines of Iuie round The well growne Oake; the Vine doth court the Elme; Yet these are different Plants. Parthenophill, Consider this aright, then these sleight creatures, Will fortifie the reasons I should frame For that vngrounded (as thou think'st) affection, Which is submitted to a strangers pitie. True loue may blush, when shame repents too late, But in all actions, Nature yeelds to Fate. Eroc. Great Lady, 'twere a dulnesse must exceed The grossest and most sottish kind of ignorance, Not to be sensible of your intents: I clearely vnderstand them. Yet so much The difference betweene that height and lownesse, Which doth distinguish our vnequall fortunes, Disswades me from ambition; that I am Humbler in my desires, then Loues owne power Can any way raise vp. Tham. I am a Princesse, And know no law of slauery, to sue, Yet be denied? Ero. I am so much a subiect To euery law of Noble honesty, That to transgresse the vowes of perfect friendship, I hold a sacriledge as foule, and curs'd, As if some holy Temple had bin robd, And I the thiefe. Tham. Thou art vnwise, young man, To inrage a Lyonesse. Eroc. It were vniust To falsifie a faith, and euer after Disroab'd of that faire ornament, liue naked, A scorne to time and truth. Tham. Remember well who I am, and what thou art. Ero. That remembrance Prompts me to worthy duty, O great Lady. If some few dayes haue tempted your free heart, To cast away affection on a stranger: If that affection haue so ouersway'd Your Iudgement, that it in a manner hath Declyn'd your soueraignty of birth and spirit: How can yee turne your eyes off from that glasse, Wherein you may new Trim, and settle right A memorable name? Tham. The Youth is idle. Ero. Dayes, months and yeeres are past, since Menaphon Hath lou'd and seru'd you truly: Menaphon; A man of no large distance in his bloud, From yours; in qualities desertfull, grac't With Youth, Experience; euery happy gift That can by nature, or by Education Improue a Gentleman: for him (great Lady) Let me preuaile, that you will yet at last, Vnlocke the bounty, which your loue and care Haue wisely treasur'd vp, t'inrich his life. Tha. Thou hast a moouing eloquence; Parthenophill, Parthenophill, in vaine we striue to crosse The destiny that guides vs. My great heart Is stoopt so much beneath that wonted pride That first disguiz'd it, that I now preferre A miserable life with thee, before All other earthly comforts. Eroc. Menaphon, by me, repeates the selfe-same words to you: You are too cruell, if you can distrust His truth, or my report. Tham. Goe where thou wilt, Ile be an exile with thee, I will learne To beare all change of fortunes. Ero. For my friend, I pleade with grounds of reason. Tham. For thy loue, Hard-hearted youth, I here renounce all thoughts Of other hopes, of other intertainements,â Eroc. Stay, as you honour Vertue. Tham. When the proffers of other greatnesseâ Eroc. Lady. Tham. When intreats of friends;â Eroc. Ile ease your griefe. Tham. Respect of kindred; Eroc. Pray giue me hearing. Tham. Losse of Fame; Eroc. I craue but some few minutes. Tham. Shall infringe my vowes, let Heauenâ Eroc. My loue speake t'ee; heare then, goe on. Tham. Thy loue, why, tis a Charme to stop a vow In its most violent course. Eroc. Cupid has broke His Arrowes here; and like a child vnarm'd, Comes to make sport betweene vs with no weapon, But feathers stolne from his mothers Doues. Tham. This is meere trifling. Eroc. Lady, take a secret. I am as you are, in a lower ranke Else of the selfe same sexe, a maide, a virgine. And now to vse your owne words, if your thoughts Censure me not with mercy, you may soone Conceiue, I haue laid by that modesty, Which should preserue a vertuous name vnstain'd. Tham. Are you not mankind then? Eroc. When you shall reade The story of my sorrowes, with the change Of my misfortunes, in a letter printed From my vnforg'd relation; I beleeue You will not thinke the sheading of one teare, A prodigality that misbecomes Your pitie and my fortune. Tham. Pray conceale the errors of my passions. Eroc. Would I had Much more of honour (as for life I value't not) To venture on your secrecy. Tham. It will be A hard taske for my Reason, to relinquish The affection which was once deuoted thine, I shall a while repute thee still the youth I lou'd so dearely. Eroc. You shall find mee euer, your ready faithfull seruant. Tham. O the powers Who doe direct our hearts, laugh at our follies! We must not part yet. Ero. Let not my vnworthines alter your good opinion. Tham. I shall henceforth Be iealous of thy company with any; My feares are strong and many. Kala enters. Kala. Did your Ladiship call me? Tham. For what? Kala. Your seruant Menaphon desires admittance. Enter Menaphon. Men. With your leaue, great Mistris! I comeâ So priuate: is this well, Parthenophill? Eroc. Sir, Noble Sir. Men. You are vnkind and treacherous. This tis to trust a straggler. Tham. Prethee seruant. Men. I dare not question you, you are my Mistris; My Princes neerest Kinswoman, but heâ Tham. Come, you are angry. Mena. Henceforth I will bury Vnmanly passion in perpetuall silence. Ile court mine owne distraction, dote on folly, Creepe to the mirth and madnesse of the age, Rather then be so slau'd againe to woman, Which in her best of constancy is steddist In change and scorne. Tham. How dare ye talke to me thus? Men. Dare? Were you not owne Sister to my friend, Sister to my Amethus; I would hurle ye As farre off from mine eyes, as from my heart; For I would neuer more looke on yee. Take Your Iewell t'ee. And Youth, keepe vnder wing, OrâBoyâBoy. Tham. If commands be of no force, Let me intreat thee, Menaphon. Men. Tis naught, fye, fye, Parthenophill, haue I deseru'd To be thus vs'd? Eroc. I doe protestâ Men. You shall not, Henceforth I will be free, and hate my bondage. Enter Amethus. Amet. Away, away to Court, the Prince is pleas'd To see a Maske to night, we must attend him: Tis neere vpon the time.âHow thriues your suit? Men. The Iudge, your Sister, will decide it shortly. Tham. Parthenophill, I will not trust you from me. Enter Prince, Aretas, Corax (with a Paper-plot) seruants with torches. Cor. Lights and attendance, I will shew your highnes, A trifle of mine owne braine. If you can, Imagine you were now in the Vniuersity, You'll take it well enough, a Schollers fancy, A quab. Tis nothing else a very quab. Prince. We will obserue it. Soph. Yes, and grace it too Sir. For Corax else is humorous and testy. Aret. By any meanes, men singular in Art, Haue alwayes some odde whimsey more then vsuall. Prince. The name of this conceit. Cora. Sir, it is called the Maske of Melancholy. Aret. We must looke for nothing but sadnesse, here then. Cora. Madnesse rather In seuerall changes: Melancholy is The Roote aswell of euery Apish Phrensey, Laughter and mirth, as dulnesse. Pray my Lord Hold and obserue the plot, tis there exprest In kind, what shall be now exprest in action. Enter Amethus, Menaphon, Thamasta, Eroclea. No interpretation, take your places quickly. Nay, nay, leaue ceremony: sound to the entrance. Florish. Enter Rhetias, his face whited, blacke shag haire, long nailes, a piece of raw meate. Rhet. Bow, Bow, wow, wow; the Moone's eclipsed, Ile to the Church-yard and sup: Since I turn'd Wolfe, I bark and howle, and digge vp graues, I will neuer haue the Sunne shine againe, tis midnight, deepe darke midnight, get a prey, and fall too, I haue catcht thee now. Arre. Cora. This kind is called, Lycanthropia, Sir, When men conceiue themselues Wolues. Prince. Here I finde it. Enter Pelias. A Crowne of feathers on, Antickly rich. Pel. I will hang 'em all, and burne my wife: was I not an Emperour; my hand was kist, and Ladies lay downe before me. In triumph did I ride with my Nobles about me, till the mad-dog bit mee, I fell, and I fell, and I fell. It shall be treason by Statute for any man to name water, or wash his hands throughout all my Dominions; breake all the looking-glasses, I will not see my hornes; my wife Cuckolds me, she is a whore, a whore, a whore, a whore. Prince. Hydrophobia terme you this? Cora. And men possest so, shun all sight of water: Sometimes, if mixt with iealousie, it renders them Incurable, and oftentimes brings death. Enter Philosopher in blacke rags, a copper chaine on, an old Gowne halfe off, and Booke. Phi. Philosophers dwel in the Moone Speculation and Theory girdle the world about like a wall. Ignorance like an Atheist, must bee damn'd in the pit. I am very, very poore, and pouerty is the phisicke for the soule: my opinions are pure and perfect. Enuy is a monster, and I defie the beast. Cora. Delirium this is call'd, which is meere dotage, Sprung from Ambition first, and singularity, Selfe loue, and blind opinion of true merit. Prince. I not dislike the course. Enter Grilla in a rich Gowne, great Vardingale, great Ruffe, Muffe, Fan, and Coxcombe on her head. Grill. Yes forsooth, and no forsooth, is not this fine, I pray, your blessing Gaffer, here, here, here did hee giue me a shough, and cut offs taile: busse, busse Nuncle, and ther's a pum for Daddee. Cora. You find this noted there, Phrenitis. Prince. True. Cora. Pride is the ground on't; It raignes most in women. Enter Cuculus like a Bedlam singing. Cucul. They that will learne to drinke a health in Hell, Must learne on earth to take Tobacco well, To take Tobacco well, to take Tobacco well: For in Hell they drink nor Wine, nor Ale, nor Beere, But fire, and smoake, and stench, as we do heere. Rhet. Ile soope thee vp. Pel. Thou'st straight to execution. Gril. Foole, Foole, Foole, catch me and thou canst. Philos. Expell him the house, tis a Dunce. Cuculus sings. Harke, did yee not heare a rumbling, The Gobblings are now a tumbling: Ile teare 'em, Ile seare 'em, Ile roare 'em, Ile goare 'em: Now, now, now, my braines are a Iumbling,â Bounce, the gun's off. Prince. You name this here, Hypocondriacall. Cora. Which is a windy flattuous humour stuffing The head, and thence deriu'd to th'animall parts To be too ouer-curious, losse of goods, Or friends, excesse of feare, or sorrowes cause it. Enter a Sea-nimph big-bellied, singing and dancing. Good your Honours, Pray your Worships, Deare your Beauties, Cucul. Hang thee. To lash your sides, To tame your hides, To scourge your prides, And bang thee. Nym. Were pretty and dainty, and I will begin, See how they doe Ieere me, deride me, and grin: Come sport me, come court me, your Topsaile aduance, And let vs conclude our delights in a Dance. All. A Dance, a Dance, a Dance. Cora. This is the Wanton Melancholy; women With child possest with this strange fury often, Haue danc'd three dayes together without ceasing. Prince. Tis very strange: but Heau'n is full of miracles. The Dance:â Which ended, they all run out in couples. Prince. We are thy debtor (Corax) for the gift Of this inuention: but the plot deceiues vs; What meanes this empty space. Cora. One kind of Melancholy Is onely left vntouch'd; twas not in Art To personate the shadow of that Fancy. Tis nam'd Loue-Melancholy. As for instance, Admit this stranger here (Young man, stand forth) Intangled by the beauty of this Lady, The great Thamasta, cherisht in his heart The waight of hopes and feares: it were impossible, To lymne his passions in such liuely colours, As his owne proper sufferance coo'd expresse. Ero. You are not modest Sir. Tham. Am I your mirth? Cora. Loue is the Tyrant of the heart, it darkens Reason, confounds discretion, deafe to counsell: It runnes a headlong course to desperate madnesse. O were your Highnes but toucht home, and throughly, With this (what shall I call it) Diuellâ Prince. Hold, let no man henceforth name the word agen Wait you my pleasure, Youth; tis late, to rest. Cora. My Lordsâ Soph. Enough, thou art a perfect Arts-man. Cora. Panthers may hide their heads, not change the skin: And loue pent ne're so close yet will be seene. Exeunt.

Seruilely; and pardon me, if I say basely. Amet. Women in their passions, Like false fiers flash, to fright our trembling sences; Yet in themselues containe nor light nor heate. My Sister doe this? Shee, whose pride did scorne All thoughts that were not busied on a Crowne? To fall so farre beneath her fortunes now? You are my friend. Mena. What I confirme, is truth. Amet. Truth, Menaphon? Mena. If I conceiu'd you were Iealous of my sincerity and plainnesse, Then Sirâ Amet. What then, Sir? Mena. I would then resolue, You were as changeable in vowes of friendship, As is Thamasta in her choice of loue. That sinne is double, running in a blood, Which iustifies another being worse. Amet. My Menaphon, excuse me, I grow wilde, And would not willingly beleeue the truth Of my dishonour: She shall know how much I am a debtor to thy noble goodnesse, By checking the contempt, her poore desires Haue sunke her fame in. Prethee tell me (friend) How did the Youth receiue her? Mena. With a coldnesse, As modest and as hopelesse, as the trust I did repose in him, coo'd wish, or merit. Enter Thamasta and Kala. Ame. I will esteeme him dearely. Men. Sir, your Sister. Tha. Seruant, I haue imployment for yee. Amet. Harke yee: The maske of your ambition is fallen off, Your pride hath stoop't to such an abiect lownesse, That you haue now discouer'd to report Your nakednesse in vertue, honors, shameâ Tham. You are turn'd Satyre. Ame. All the flatteries Of greatnesse haue expos'd yee to contempt. Tham. This is meere rayling. Amet. You haue sold your birth, for lust. Tham. Lust? Amet. Yes, and at a deare expence Purchast the onely glories of a Wanton. Tham. A Wanton? Amet. Let repentance stop your mouth. Learne to redeeme your fault. Kal. I hope your tongue ha's not betrayd my honesty. Men. Feare nothing. Tham. If (Menaphon,) I hitherto haue stroue; To keepe a wary guard about my fame; If I haue vsed a womans skill to sift The constancy of your protested loue; You cannot in the Iustice of your iudgment, Impute that to a Coynesse, or neglect, Which my discretion and your seruice aym'd For noble purposes. Mena. Great Mistris, no: I rather quarrell with mine owne ambition, That durst to soare so high, as to feed hope Of any least desert, that might intitle My duty, to a pension from your fauours. Ame. And therefore Lady (pray obserue him well) He henceforth couers playne equality; Indeuouring to rancke his fortunes low, With some fit partner, whom without presumption, Without offence, or danger, he may cherish; Yes and command too, as a Wife; a Wife; A Wife, my most great Lady Kala. all will out. Tham. Now I perceiue the league of Amitye, Which you haue long betweene yee, vow'd and kept, Is sacred and inuiolable, secrets Of euery nature are in common t'ee: I haue trespass'd, and I haue been faulty: Let not too rude a Censure doome me guilty, Or iudge my errour wilfull without pardon. Men. Gracious and vertuous Mistris. Ame. Tis a tricke, There is no trust in female cunning (friend) Let her first purge her follies past, and cleere The wrongs done to her honor, by some sure Apparant testimony of her constancy: Or wee will not beleeue these childish plots; As you respect my friendship, lend no eare To a reply. Thinke on't. Men. Pray loue your fame. Exeunt Men. Amet. Tham. Gon! I am sure awakt. Kala I finde, You haue not been so trusty as the duty You ow'd, requir'd. Kala. Not I?

Thar't an excellent fellow. Diabolo, O this lousie close-stoole Empricks, that will vndertake all Cures, yet know not the causes of any disease. Dog-leaches. By the foure Elements I honor thee, coo'd finde in my heart to turne knaue, and bee thy flatterer. Cora. Sirra, tis pitty th'ast not been a Scholer; Th'art honest, blunt, and rude enough. O Conscience! But for thy Lord now, I haue put him too't. Rhet. He chafes hugely, fumes like a stew-pot; Is he not monstrously ouergone in frenzy? Cora. Rhetias, tis not a madnesse, but his sorrow's Close griping griefe, and anguish of the soule That torture him: he carries Hell on earth Within his bosome, 'twas a Princes tyranny Caus'd his distraction, and a Princes sweetnes Must qualifie that tempest of his minde. Rhet. Corax, to prayse thy Art, were to assure The misbeleeuing world, that the Sunne shines, When tis in th'full Meridian of his beauty. No cloud of blacke detraction can eclipse The light of thy rare knowledge; henceforth casting All poore disguises off, that play in rudenesse, Call me your seruant: onely for the present, I wish a happy blessing to your Labours; Heauen crowne your vndertakings; and beleeue me, Ere many houres can passe, at our next meeting, The bonds my duty owes, shall be full cancelled. Exit. Cora. Farwellâa shrewd-braine Whorson, there's pith In his vntoward plainenesse.â Enter Trollio with a Murrion on. Now, the newes! Troll. Worshipfull Master Doctor, I haue a great deale of I cannot tell what, to say t'ee: My Lord thunders: euery word that comes out of his mouth, roares like a Cannon: the house shooke once, my young Lady dares not be seene. Cora. We will roare with him, Trollio, if he roare. Trol. He has got a great Poll-axe in his hand, and fences it vp and downe the house, as if he were to make roome for the Pageants. I haue prouided me a Murrion for feare of a clap on the Coxcombe. Cora. No matter for the Murrion, here's my Cap: Thus I will pull it downe; and thus out-stare him. Trol. The Physicion is got as mad as my Lord.â O braue, a man of Worship. Cor. Let him come, Trollio, I will firke his Trangdido, And bounce, and bounce in metall, honest Trollio. Trol. Hee vapours like a Tinker, and struts like a Iuggler. Menander within. So ho. So ho. Troll. There, there, there; looke to your Right Worshipfull, looke to your selfe. Enter Meleander with a poll-axe. Mel. Show me the Dog, whose triple throated noyse, Hath rowzd a Lyon from his vncoth den, To teare the Curre in pieces. Cor. Stay thy pawes, Couragious beast, else lo, the gorgeous skull, That shall transforme thee, to that restlesse stone, Which Sysiphus roules vp against the hill; Whence tumbling downe againe, it, with his waight Shall crush thy bones, and puffe thee into Ayre. Mel. Hold, hold thy conqu'ring breath, tis stronger far Then Gun-powder and Garlike. If the Fates Haue spun my thred, and my spent-clue of life Be now vntwisted, let vs part like friends. Lay vp my weapon, Trollio, and be gone. Trol. Yes Sir, with all my heart.â Exit. Trollio Mel. This friend and I will walke, and gabble wisely. Cor. I allow the motion: On. Mel. So Polititians thriue, That with their crabbed faces, and sly tricks Legerdemayne, ducks, cringes, formall beards, Crisp'd haires, and punctuall cheats, do wriggle in Their heads first, like a Foxe, to roomes of State, Then the whole body followes. Cor. Then they fill Lordships, steale womens hearts: with them and their's the world runnes round, yet these are square men still. Mel. There are none poore, but such as ingrosse offices. Cor. None wise; but vnthrifts, bankrupts, beggers, Rascals. Mel. The hangman is a rare Phisician. Cor. Thats not so good, it shalbe granted. Mel. All the buz of Drugs, and Myneralls and Simples, Bloud-lettings, Vomits, Purges, or what else Is coniur'd vp by men of Art, to gull Liege-people, and reare golden piles, are trash To a well-strong-wrought halter; there the Goute, The stone, yes and the Melancholy deuill, Are cur'd in lesse time then a paire of minutes. Build me a Gallows in this very plot, And Ile dispatch your businesse. Cora. Fix the knot right vnder the left eare. Mel. Sirra, make ready. Cora. Yet doe not be too sudden, grant me leaue, To giue a farewell to a creature long Absented from me, tis a daughter (Sir) Snatcht from me in her youth, a handsome girle, Shee comes to aske a blessing. Mel. Pray where is shee? I cannot see her yet. Cora. Shee makes more haste In her quicke prayers then her trembling steppes, Which many griefes haue weakened. Mel. Cruell man! How canst thou rip a heart, that's cleft already With iniuries of time? whilst I am franticke, Whilst throngs of rude diuisions huddle on, And doe difranke my braines from peace, and sleepe; So long I am insensible of cares. As balls of wild-fire may be safely toucht, Not violently sundred, and throwne vp; So my distemper'd thoughts rest in their rage, Not hurryed in the Ayre of repetition, Or memory of my misfortunes past. Then are my griefes strooke home, When they are reclaym'd, To their owne pitty of themseluesâProceed; What of your daughter now? Cor. I cannot tell yee, Tis now out of my head againe; my braines Are crazie; I haue scarce slept one sound sleepe These twelue moneths. Mel. 'las poore man; canst thou imagine To prosper in the taske thou tak'st in hand, By practising a cure vpon my weakenesse, And yet be no Physician for thy selfe? Goe, goe, turne ouer all thy bookes once more, And learne to thriue in modesty; for impudence Does least become a Scholer. Thou art a foole, A kind of learned foole. Cor. I doe confesse it. Mel. If thou canst wake with me, forget to eate, Renounce the thought of Greatnesse; tread on Fate; Sigh out a lamentable tale of things Done long agoe, and ill done; and when sighes Are wearied, piece vp what remaines behind, With weeping eyes, and hearts that bleed to death: Thou shalt be a companion fit for me, And we will sit together like true friends, And neuer be deuided. With what greedinesse Doe I hug my afflictions? there's no mirth Which is not truly season'd with some madnesse. As for example.â Exit. Cora. What new Crochet next? There is so much sence in this wilde distraction, That I am almost out of my wits too, To see and heare him: some few houres more Spent here, would turne me Apish, if not frantick. Enter Meleander and Cleophyla. In all the volumes thou hast turn'd, thou Man Of knowledge, hast thou met with any rarity, Worthy thy contemplation like to this? The modell of the Heauens, the Earth, the Waters, The harmony, and sweet consent of times, Are not of such an excellence, in forme Of their Creation, as the infinite wonder That dwelles within the compasse of this face: And yet I tell thee, Scholer, vnder this Well-ord'red signe, is lodg'd such an obedience, As will hereafter in another age, Strike all comparison into a silence. She had a Sister too: but as for her, If I were giuen to talke, I coo'd describe A pretty piece of goodnesse: let that passeâ We must be wise somtimes: What would you with her? Cor. I with her! nothing by your leaue, Sir, I: It is not my profession. Mel. You are sawcy, And as I take it, scuruy in your sawcinesse, To vse no more respectâgood soule, be patient: We are a paire of things the world doth laugh at: Yet be content, Cleophila; those clouds Which barre the Sunne from shining on our miseries, Will neuer be chac'd off till I am dead; And then some charitable soule will take thee Into protection. I am hasting on, The time cannot be long. Cleo. I doe beseech yee, Sir, as you loue your health, as you respect My safety, let not passion ouerrule you. Mel. It shall not, I am friends with all the world. Get me some wine, to witnesse that I will be An absolute good fellow, I will drinke with thee. Cora. Haue you prepar'd his Cup? Cleo. Tis in readinesse. Enter Cuculus and Grilla. Cucul. By your leaue, Gallants, I come to speake with a young Lady, as they say, the old Troianes daughter of the house. Mel. Your businesse with my Lady daughter, Tosse-pot? Gril. Tosse-pot? O base! Tosse-pot? Cucul. Peace; do'st not see in what case he is? I would doe my owne commendations to her; that's all. Mel. Doe, come my Genius, we will quaffe in wine Till we grow wise. Cora. True Nectar is diuine. Exit Mel. &amp; Cora. Cucul. So, I am glad he is gone. Page, walke aside. Sweet Beauty, I am sent Embassadour from the Mistris of my thoughts, to you, the Mistris of my desires. Cleo. So Sir, I pray be briefe. Cucul. That you may know, I am not as they say, an Animall; which is as they say, a kinde of Cokes, which is as the learned terme, an Asse, a Puppy, a Widgin, a Dolt, a Noddy, aâ Cleo. As you please. Cucul. Pardon me for that, it shall be as you please indeed. Forsooth I loue to be courtly, and in fashion. Cleo. Well, to your Embasie; what, or from whom? Cucul. Marry what is more then I know? for to know what's what, is to know what's what, and for what's what: but these are foolish figures, and to little purpose. Cleo. From whom then are you sent? Cucul. There you come to me agen: O, to bee in the fauour of great Ladies, is asmuch to say, as to be great in Ladies fauours. Cleo. Good time a day t'ee; I can stay no longer. Cucul. By this light but you must, for now I come toot. The most excellent, most wise, most dainty, precious, louing, kinde, sweet, intolerably faire Lady Thamasta commends to your little hands, this letter of importance. By your leaue, let me first kisse and then deliuer it in fashion, to your owne proper beauty. Cleo. To me from her? Tis strange; I dare peruse it. Cucul. Good, O that I had not resolu'd to liue a single life! Heer's temptation able to coniure vp a spirit with a witnesse. So so: she has read it. Cleo. Is't possible? Heauen, thou art great and bountiful. Sir, I much thanke your paines: and to the Princesse, Let my loue, duty, seruice, be remembred. Cucul. They shall Mad-dame. Cleo. When we of hopes, or helpes, are quite bereauen, Our humble pray'rs haue entrance into heau'n. Cucul. Thats my opinion cleerely and without doubt. Exit. Enter Aretas and Sophronos. Aret. The Prince is throughly mou'd. Sophron. I neuer saw him so much distemp'red. Aret. What should this young man bee, Or whither can he be conuay'd? Sophr. Tis to me a mystery, I vnderstand it not. Aret. Nor I. Enter Prince Amethus and Pelias. Prince. Yee haue consented all to worke vpon The softnesse of my nature; but take heede: Though I can sleepe in silence, and looke on The mockery yee make of my dull patience; Yet'ee shall know, the best of yee, that in mee There is a masculin, a stirring spirit; Which prouokt, shall like a bearded Comet Set yee at gaze, and threaten horrour. Pel. Good Sir. Prin. Good Sir. Tis not your actiue wit or language, Nor your graue politicke wisdomes (Lords) shall dare To check-mate and controle my iust commands. Enter Menaphon. Where is the Youth your friend? is he found yet? Men. Not to be heard of. Prince. Flye then to the desart, Where thou didst first encounter this Fantasticke, This airie apparition; come no more In sight: Get yee all from me; he that stayes, Is not my friend. Amet. Tis strange. Aret., Soph. We must obey. Exeunt all but the Prince. Prince. Some angry power, cheates with rare delusions, My credulous sense: the very soule of Reason Is troubled in meâthe Physician Presented a strange Maske, the view of it Puzzl'd my vnderstanding: but the Boyâ Enter Rhetias. Rhetias, thou art acquainted with my griefes, Parthenophill is lost, and I would see him; For he is like to some thing I remember A great while since, a long, long time agoe. Rhet. I haue been diligent (Sir) to pry into euery corner for discouery, but cannot meet with him: There is some tricke I am confident. Prin. There is, there is some practice, sleight or plot. Rhet. I haue apprehended a faire Wench, in an odde Priuate lodging in the Citie, as like the Youth In face, as can by possibility be discern'd. Prince. How Rhetias! Rhet. If it be not Parthenophill in long coates, Tis a spirit in his likenesse; answer I can get none from her; you shall see her. Prince. The young man in disguise vpon my life, To steale out of the Land. Rhet. Ile send him t'ee. Exit Rhet. Enter Eroclea in womans attire, and listens. Prince. Doe, doe my Rhetias. As there is by nature In euery thing created contrarietie: So likewise is there vnity and league Betweene them in their kind; but Man, the abstract Of all perfection, which the workmanship Of Heauen hath model'd, in himselfe containes Passions of seuerall qualitie, the musicke Of mans faire composition best accords, When tis in consort, not in single straines. My heart has been vntun'd these many moneths, Wanting her presence, in whose equall loue True harmony consisted; liuing here We are Heau'ns bounty all, but Fortunes exercise. Eroc. Minutes are numbred by the fall of Sands; As by an houre-glasse, the span of time Doth waste vs to our graues, and we looke on it. An age of pleasures reuel'd out, comes home At last, and ends in sorrow, but the life Weary of ryot, numbers euery Sand, Wayling in sighes, vntill the last drop downe, So to conclude calamity in rest. Prince. What Eccho yeelds a voyce to my complaints? Can I be no where priuate? Eroc. Let the substance As suddenly be hurried from your eyes, As the vaine sound can passe your eare, If no impression of a troth vow'd yours, Kneeles. Retaine a constant memory. Prince. Stand vp; tis not the figure stampt vpon thy cheekes, The coozenage of thy beauty, grace, or tongue, Can draw from me a secret, that hath been The onely Iewell of my speechlesse thoughts. Eroc. I am so worne away with feares and sorrowes, So wintred with the tempests of affliction, That the bright Sunne of your life-quickning presence Hath scarce one beame of force, to warme againe That spring of chearefull comfort, which youth once Apparel'd in fresh lookes. Prince. Cunning Impostor, Vntruth hath made thee subtle in thy trade: If any neighbouring Greatnesse hath seduc'd A free-borne resolution, to attempt Some bolder act of treachery, by cutting My weary dayes off. Wherefore (Cruell-mercy) Hast thou assum'd a shape, that would make treason A piety, guilt pardonable, blood-shed As holy as the sacrifice of peace? Eroc. The Incense of my loue-desires, are flam'd Vpon an Altar of more constant proofe. Sir, O Sir, turne me backe into the world, Command me to forget my name, my birth, My Fathers sadnesse, and my death aliue, If all remembrance of my Faith hath found A buriall, without pitie in your scorne. Prince. My scorne (disdainefull Boy) shall soone vnweaue The web thy Art hath twisted: cast thy shape off, Disroabe the mantle of a fained Sex, And so I may be gentle; as thou art, There's witch-craft in thy language, in thy face, In thy demeanors; turne, turne from me (prethee) For my beliefe is arm'd else. Yet (faire subtilty) Before we part (for part we must) be true, Tell me thy Countrey. Eroc. Cyprus. Prince. Ha: thy Father. Eroc. Meleander. Prince. Hast a name? Eroc. A name of misery, the vnfortunate Eroclea. Prince. There is danger In this seducing counterfeit, great goodnesse! Hath honesty and vertue left the time? Are we become so impious, that to tread The path of impudence, is Law and Iustice? Thou vizard of a beauty euer sacred, Giue me thy name. Eroc. Whil'st I was lost to memory, Parthenophill did shrowd my shame in change Of sundry rare misfortunes: but since now I am, before I dye, return'd to claime A Conuoy to my graue, I must not blush To let Prince Pallador (if I offend,) Know when he doomes me, that he doomes Eroclea. I am that wofull Maid. Prince. Ioyne not too fast Thy penance, with the story of my suffrings. So dwelt simplicity with virgin truth; So Martyrdome and holinesse are twins, As innocence and sweetnesse on thy tongue. But let me by degrees collect my senses, I may abuse my trust. Tell me, what ayre Hast thou perfum'd, since Tyranny first rauisht The contract of our hearts? Eroc. Deare Sir, in Athens haue I been buried. Prince. Buried! Right, as I In Cyprus.âCome to triall, if thou beest Eroclea, in my bosome I can finde thee. Eroc. As I, Prince Palador, in mine: This gift She shewes him a Tablet. His bounty blest me with, the onely physicke My solitary cares haue hourely tooke, To keepe me from despaire. Prince. We are but Fooles To trifle in disputes, or vainely struggle With that eternall mercy which protects vs. Come home, home to my heart, thou banisht-peace, My extasie of ioyes would speake in passion, But that I would not lose that part of man, Which is reseru'd to intertaine content. Eroclea, I am thine; O let me seize thee As my inheritance. Hymen shall now Set all his Torches burning, to giue light Throughout this Land, new settled in thy welcome. Eroc. You are still gracious. Sir, how I haue liu'd, By what meanes been conuey'd, by what preseru'd, By what return'd; Rhetias, my trusty seruant, Directed by the wisdome of my Vncle, The good Sophronos, can informe at large. Prince. Enough, in stead of Musicke, euery night To make our sleepes delightfull, thou shalt cloze Our weary eyes with some part of thy story. Eroc. O but my Father! Prince. Feare not: to behold Eroclea safe, will make him young againe; It shall be our first taske. Blush sensuall follies, Which are not guarded with thoughts chastly pure. âThere is no faith in lust, but baytes of Artes; âTis vertuous loue keepes cleare contracted hearts.</field>

Tis well, tis well, the houre is at hand, Which must conclude the busines, that no Art Coo'd al this while make ripe for wisht content. O Lady, in the turmoyles of our liues, Men are like politike States, or troubled Seas, Tost vp and downe with seuerall stormes and tempests, Change, and varietie of wracks, and fortunes, Till labouring to the Hauens of our homes, We struggle for the Calme that crownes our ends. Cleo. A happy end Heauen blesse vs with. Cora. Tis well said, the old man sleepes still soundly? Cleo. May soft dreames Play in his fancy, that when he awakes, With comfort, he may by degrees, digest The present blessings in a moderate Ioy. Cora. I drencht his cup to purpose; he ne're stir'd At Barber or at Taylor: a will laugh At his owne Metamorphosis, and wonder. We must be watchfull. Does the Coach stand ready? Enter Trollio. Cleo. All as you commanded. What's your haste for? Trol. A brace of bigge women, vsher'd by the young old Ape, with his shee-clog at his bum, are enterd the Castle; Shall they come on? Cora. By any meanes, the time is precious now; Lady, be quick and carefull, follow, Trollio. Trol. I owe all Sir-Reuerence to your Right Worshipfulnesse. Cleo. So many feares, so many ioyes, encounter My doubtfull expectations, that I wauer Betweene the resolution of my hopes And my obedience; tis not (O my Fate) The apprehension of a timely blessing In pleasures, shakes my weakenesse; but the danger Of a mistaken duty, that confines The limits of my reason; let me liue, Vertue, to thee as chaste, as Truth to time. Enter Thamasta. Tham. Attend me till I call.âMy sweet Cleophila. Cleo. Great Princesseâ Tham. I bring peace, to sue a Pardon For my neglect, of all those noble vertues Thy minde and duty are apparel'd with. I haue deseru'd ill from thee, and must say, Thou art too gentle, if thou canst forget it. Cleo. Alas, you haue not wrong'd me; for indeed, Acquaintance with my sorrowes, and my fortune, Were growne to such familiarity, That twas an impudence, more then presumption, To wish so great a Lady as you are, Should lose affection on my Vncles Sonne, But that your Brother, equall in your blood, Should stoope to such a lownesse, as to loue A Cast-away, a poore despised Maid, Onely for me to hope was almost sinne, Yet troth I neuer tempted him. Tha. Chide not the grossenes of my trespasse (louely Sweetnes) In such an humble language, I haue smarted Already in the wounds, my pride hath made Vpon thy sufferings. Henceforth tis in you To worke my happinesse. Cleo. Call any seruice Of mine a debt, for such it is; the Letter You lately sent me, in the blest contents It made me priuy to, hath largely quitted Euery suspition of your Grace or goodnesse. Tham. Let me imbrace thee with a Sisters loue, A Sisters loue, Cleophila: for should My Brother henceforth study to forget The vowes that he hath made thee, I would euer Sollicite thy deserts. Enter Amethus and Menaphon. Ame. We must haue entrance. Tham. Must? Who are they say, must? you are vnmannerly. Brother is't you, and you too, Sir? Ame. Your Ladiship has had a time of Scolding to your humour: Does the storme hold still? Cleo. Neuer fell a showre More seasonably gentle on the barren Parcht thirsty earth, then showres of courtesie Haue from this Princesse been distilled on me, To make my growth in quiet of my mind Secure and lasting. Tham. You may both beleeue that I was not vnciuill. Ame. Pish, I know her spirit, and her enuy. Cleo. Now in troth, Sir, Pray credit me, I doe not vse to sweare; The vertuous Princesse hath in words and carriage Been kind, so ouer-kind, that I doe blush: I am not rich enough in thankes sufficient For her vnequall'd bounty.âMy good Cousin, I haue a suite to you. Men. It shall be granted. Cleo. That no time, no perswasion, no respects Of Iealousies past, present, or hereafter By possibilitie to be conceiued, Draw you from that sincerity and purenesse Of loue, which you haue oftentimes protested To this great worthy Lady, she deserues A duty more, then what the tyes of Marriage Can claime, or warrant: be for euer hers, As she is yours, and Heauen increase your comforts.

You lou'd her; For sure you swore you did: else if you did not Here fixe your heart, and thus resolue, if now You misse this Heauen on earth, you cannot find In any other choice ought but a hell. Ame. The Ladies are turn'd Lawyers, and pleade handsomely Their Clients cases. I am an easie Iudge, And so shalt thou be, Menaphon. I giue thee My Sister for a wife; a good one, friend. Men. Lady, will you confirme the gift? Tham. The errors of my mistaken iudgement being lost, To your remembrance, I shall euer striue In my obedience to deserue your pity. Men. My loue, my care, my all. Amet. What rests for me? I'm still a Batchelor: Sweet Maid, resolue me, May I yet call you mine? Cleo. My Lord Amethus, Blame not my plainenesse, I am young and simple, And haue not any power to dispose Mine owne will without warrant from my father: That purchast, I am yours. Amet. It shall suffice me. Enter Cuculus, Pelias, Trollio and Grilla pluckt in by 'em. Cucul. Reuenge, I must haue reuenge; I will haue reuenge, bitter and abominable reuenge; I will haue reuenge. This vnfashionable Mungrill, this Linsey-woolsey of mortality, by this hand, Mistris, this shee-Roague is drunke, and clapper-clawd me without any reuerence to my person, or good garments, why d'ee not speake, Gentlemen. Pel. Some certaine blowes haue past, and't like your Highnesse. Troll. Some few knocks of Friendship, some loue-toyes, some Cuffes in kindnesse, or so. Gril. Ile turne him away, he shall bee my Master no longer. Men. Is this your she-Page, Cuculus? tis a Boy, sure. Cucul. A Boy, an arrant Boy in long coates. Troll. He has mumbled his nose, that tis as big as a great Cod peece. Cucul. Oh thou Cock vermine of iniquity. Tha. Pelias, take hence the wag, and schoole him for't. For your part, seruant, Ile intreate the Prince To grant you some fit place about his Wardrobe. Cucul. Euer after a bloody nose do I dreame of good lucke. I horribly thanke your Ladiship. Whil'st I'm in office, the old garbe shall agen Grow in request, and Taylors shall be men. Come Trollio, helpe to wash my face, prethee. Trol. Yes, and to scowre it too.â Exit Cuculus, Trollio, Pelias, Grill. Enter Rhetias, Corax. Rhet. The Prince and Princesse are at hand, giue ouer your amorous Dialogues. Most honor'd Lady, henceforth forbeare your sadnesse: are you ready to practise your instructions? Cleo. I haue studied My part with care, and will performe it (Rhetias) With all the skill I can. Cor. Ile passe my word for her. Florish. Enter Prince, Sophronus, Aretius, and Eroclea. Prince. Thus Princes should be circled with a guard Of truly noble friends, and watchfull subiects. O Rhetias, thou art iust; the Youth thou told'st me, That liu'd at Athens, is returnd at last To her owne fortunes, and contracted Loue. Rhet. My knowledge made me sure of my report, Sir. Prince. Eroclea, cleare thy feares, when the Sun shines, Clouds must not dare to muster in the skie, Nor shal they hereâWhy do they kneele? Stand vp, The day and place is priuiledg'd. Soph. Your presence, Great Sir, makes euery roome a Sanctuary. Prince. Wherefore does this young virgin vse such circumstance, In duty to vs? Rise. Eroc. Tis I must raise her. Forgiue me, Sister, I haue been too priuate, In hiding from your knowledge any secret That should haue been in common twixt our soules: But I was rul'd by councell. Cleo. That I shew my selfe a Girle (Sister) and bewray Ioy in too soft a passion 'fore all these, I hope you cannot blame me. Prince. We must part: The sudden meeting of these two faire Riuolets With th'Iland of our armes, Cleophila, The custome of thy piety hath built Euen to thy younger yeeres a Monument Of memorable Fame; some great reward Must wait on thy desert. Soph. The Prince speakes t'ee, Neece. Cor. Chat low, I pray; let's about our businesse. The good old man awakes; my Lord, with-draw; Rhetias, let's settle here the Coach. Prince. Away then. Exit. Soft Musicke. Enter Melander (in a Coach) his haire and beard trimd, habit and gowne chang'd. Rhetias and Corax, and Boy that sings. The Song. Fly hence, shadowes, that doe keep Watchfull sorrowes, charm'd in sleepe; Though the Eyes be ouertaken, Yet the Heart doth euer waken Thoughts, chain'd vp in busie snares Of continuall woes and cares: Loue and griefes are so exprest, As they rather sigh then rest. Fly hence, shadowes, that doe keepe Watchfull sorrowes, charm'd in sleepe. Mel. Where am I? Ha? What sounds are these? Tis day, sure. Oh, I haue slept belike: tis but the foolery Of some beguiling dreame. So, so, I will not Trouble the play of my delighted Fancy But dreame my dreame out. Cor. Morrow to your Lordship: You tooke a iolly nap, and slept it soundly. Mel. Away, beast, let me alone. Cease musicke. Cora. O, by your leaue, Sir. I must be bold to raise yee, else your Phisicke Will turne to further sicknes. Mel. Phisick, Beare-leech? Cor. Yes phisick, you are mad. Mel. Trollio, Cleophila. Rhet. Sir, I am here. Mel. I know thee, Rhetias, prethee rid the roome Of this tormenting noyse. He tells me, sirra. I haue tooke phisick, Rhetias, phisicke, phisicke. Rhet. Sir true, you haue; and this most learned Scholer Apply'd t'ee. O you were in dangerous plight Before he tooke ye hand. Mel. These things are drunke, Directly drunke. Where did you get your liquor? Cor. I neuer saw a body in the wane Of age, so ouer spred with seuerall sorts Of such diseases as the strength of Youth Would groane vnder and sinke. Rhet. The more your glory in the miraculous cure. Cor. Bring me the Cordiall Prepar'd for him to take after his sleepe, Twill doe him good at heart. Rhet. I hope it will, Sir. Exit. Mel. What do'st think I am, that thou should'st fiddle So much vpon my patience? Foole, the waight Of my disease sits on my heart so heauy, That all the hands of Art cannot remoue One graine to ease my griefe. If thou cood'st poyson My memory, or wrap my senses vp Into a dulnesse, hard and cold as Flints? If thou cood'st make me walke, speake, eate and laugh Without a sense or knowledge of my faculties, Why then perhaps at Marts thou might'st make benefit Of such an Anticke motion, and get credit From credulous gazers, but not profit me. Study to gull the wise; I am too simple To be wrought on. Cor. Ile burne my bookes (old man) But I will doe thee good, and quickly too. Enter Aretus with a Patent. Aret. Most honor'd Lord Meleander, our great Master, Prince Palador of Cyprus, hath by me Sent you this Patent, in which is contain'd Not onely confirmation of the Honors You formerly enioyed, but the addition Of the Marshalship of Cyprus, and ere long He meanes to visit you. Excuse my haste, I must attend the Prince.â Exit. Cor. There's one Pill workes. Mel. Do'st know that spirit? tis a graue familiar, And talkt I know not what. Cor. Hee's like, me thinks, the Prince his Tutor, Aretus. Mel. Yes, yes; it may be I haue seene such a formality; No matter where, or when. Enter Amethus with a Staffe. Amet. The Prince hath sent ye (My Lord) this Staffe of Office, and withall Salutes you Grand Commander of the Ports Throughout his Principalities. He shortly Will visit you himselfe: I must attend him.â Exit. Cor. D'ee feele your physick stirring yet? Mel. A Diuell is a rare Iuggler, and can cheate the eye, But not corrupt the reason in the Throne Of a pure soule.âAnother? I will stand thee, Be what thou canst, I care not. Enter Sophronus with a Tablet. Soph. From the Prince, deare Brother, I present you this rich Relique, A Iewell he hath long worne in his bosome: Henceforth he bade mee say, he does beseech you To call him sonne, for he will call you Father. It is an honor (brother) that a subiect Cannot but intertaine with thankfull pray'rs. Be moderate in your Ioyes, he will in person Confirme my errand, but commands my seruice. Exit. Cora. What hope now of your Cure? Mel. Stay, stayâWhat Earthquakes Roule in my flesh? here's Prince, and Prince and Prince; Prince vpon Prince: the dotage of my sorrowes Reuells in magick of ambitious scorne, Be they Inchantments deadly (as the graue) Ile looke vpon 'em: Patent, staffe, and Relick To the last first. Round me, ye guarding ministers And euer keepe me waking till the Cliffes That ouer hang my sight fall off, and leaue These hollow spaces to be cram'd with dust. Cor. Tis time I see to fetch the Cordiall. Prethee Sit downe: Ile instantly be here againeâ Exit. Mel. Good, giue me leaue, I will sit downe indeed: Here's Company enough for me to prate to, Eroclea. Tis the same, the cunning Artsman Faultred not in a line. Coo'd he haue fashen'd A little hollow space here, and blowne breath To haue made it moue, and whisper, 't had bin excellent. But faith, tis well, tis very well as tis. Passing, most passing well. Enter Cleophila, Eroclea, Rhetias. Cleo. The soueraigne Greatnesse, Who, by Commission from the powers of heauen, Swayes both this Land and vs, our gracious Prince, By me presents you (Sir) with this large bounty, A gift more precious to him then his birth-right. Here let your cares take end; now set at liberty Your long imprison'd heart, and welcome home The solace of your soule, too long kept from you. Eroc. Deare Sir, you know me. Mel. Yes, thou art my Daughter: My eldest blessing. Know thee? Why Eroclea, I neuer did forget thee in thy absence. Poore soule, how do'st? Eroc. The best of my well-being consists in yours. Mel. Stand vp: the gods who hitherto Haue kept vs both aliue, preserue thee euer. Cleophila, I thanke thee and the Prince, I thanke thee too, Eroclea, that thou would'st In pitie of my age, take so much paines To liue, till I might once more looke vpon thee, Before I broke my heart: O twas a piece Of piety and duty vnexampled. Rhet. The good-man rellisheth his comforts strangely, The sight doth turne me child. Eroc. I haue not words that can expresse my ioyes. Cleo. Nor I. Mel. Nor I: yet let vs gaze on one another freely, And surfet with our eyes; let me be plaine, If I should speake as much as I should speake, I should talke of a thousand things at once, And all of thee, of thee (my child) of thee: My teares like ruffling winds lockt vp in Caues, Doe bustle for a ventâon t'other side, To flye out into mirth were not so comely. Come hither, let me kisse theeâwith a pride, Strength, courage, and fresh blood, which now thy presence Hath stor'd me with, I kneele before their Altars, Whose soueraignty kept guard about thy safety. Aske, aske thy Sister (prethee) shee'le tell thee How I haue been much mad. Cleo. Much discontented, Shunning all meanes that might procure him comfort. Eroc. Heauen ha's at last been gracious. Mel. So say I but wherefore drop thy words in such a sloth, As if thou wert afraid to mingle truth With thy misfortunes? Vnderstand me throughly, I would not haue thee to report at large From point to point, a Iournall of thy absence: Twill take vp too much time, I would securely Ingrosse the little remnant of my life, That thou might'st euery day be telling somewhat, Which might conuay me to my rest with comfort. Let me bethinke me, how we parted first: Puzzles my faint remembranceâBut soft, Cleophila, thou toldst me, that the Prince Sent me this present. Cleo. From his own faire hands I did receiue my Sister. Mel. To requite him, we will not dig his Fathers graue anew, Although the mention of him much concernes The businesse we inquire ofâas I said, We parted in a hurry at the Court, I to this Castle, after made my Iayle: But whither thou, deare heart? Rhet. Now they fall too't, I lookt for this. Eroc. I by my Vncles care (Sophronos, my good Vncle) suddenly was like a Saylers Boy conuey'd a shipboord that very night. Mel. A policie quicke and strange. Eroc. The ship was bound for Corinth, whither first Attended onely with your seruant Rhetias, And all fit necessaries, we arriu'd: From thence in habit of a youth we iourney'd To Athens, where till our returne of late, Haue we liu'd safe. Mel. Oh what a thing is man, To bandy factions of distemp'red passions, Against the sacred prouidence aboue him? Here in the Legend of thy two yeeres exile, Rare pity and delight are sweetly mixt, And still thou wert a Boy. Eroc. So I obey'd my Vncles wise command. Mel. Twas safely carried, I humbly thanke thy Fate. Eroc. If earthly treasures Are powr'd in plenty downe from Heau'n on mortals; They reigne amongst those Oracles, that flow In Scholes of sacred knowledge; such is Athens: Yet Athens was to me but a faire prison: The thoughts of you, my Sister, Country, Fortunes, And something of the Prince, barr'd all contents, Which else might rauish sence: for had not, Rhetias, Been alwaies comfortable to me, certainely Things had gone worse. Mel. Speake low Eroclea; That something of the Prince beares danger in it: Yet thou hast trauayl'd (Wench) for such Indowments, As might create a Prince a wife fit for him, Had he the World to guide: but touch not there; How cam'st thou home? Rhet. Sir, with your Noble sauour, Kissing your hand first, that point I can answer. Mel. Honest, right honest Rhetias. Rhet. Your graue Brother Perceiu'd with what a hopelesse loue his sonne, Lord Menaphon, too eagerly pursu'd Thamasta, Cousin to our present Prince; And to remoue the violence of affection, Sent him to Athens, where for twelue moneths space Your daughter, my young Lady and her Cousin Enioy'd each others griefes, till by his Father The Lord Sophronos we were all call'd home. Mel. Enough, enough, the world shall henceforth witnesse My thankfulnes to Heauen, and those people Who haue been pitifull to me and mine. Lend me a Looking-glasseâHow now? How came I So courtly in fresh rayments? Rhet. Here's the Glasse, Sir. Mel. I'm in the trim too.âO Cleophila, This was the goodnesse of thy care and cunning.â Whence comes this noyse? Loud Musicke. Rhet. The Prince my Lord in person. Enter Prince, Sophronos, Aretas, Amethus, Menaphon, Thamasta, Corax, Kala. Prince. Ye shall not kneele to vs; rise all, I charge ye: Father, you wrong your age, henceforth my armes And heart shall be your guard; we haue o're-heard All passages of your vnited loues. Be young againe, Meleander, liue to number A happy generation, and dye old In comforts as in yeeres. The Offices And Honours which I late on thee conferr'd, Are not fantasticke bounties, but thy merit; Enioy them liberally. Mel. My teares must thanke ye, for my tongue cannot. Cor. I haue kept my promise, &amp; giuen you a sure cordial. Mel. O, a rare one. Prince. Good man, wee both haue shar'd enough of sadnes: Though thine ha's tasted deeper of th'extreme; Let vs forget it henceforth. Where's the picture I sent yee? Keepe it, tis a counterfeit, And in exchange of that, I ceaze on this, The reall substance: with this other hand I giue away before her Fathers face His younger ioy, Cleophila, to thee Cousin Amethus: take her, and be to her More then a Father, a deseruing husband. Thus rob'd of both thy children in a minute, Thy cares are taken off. Mel. My braines are dull'd; I am intranc'd, and know not what you meane: Great, gracious Sir, alas, why do you mocke me? I am a weake old man, so poore and feeble, That my vntoward ioynts can scarcely creepe Vnto the graue, where I must seeke my rest. Prince. Eroclea was, you know, contracted mine; Cleophila, my Cousins by consent Of both their hearts: We both now claime our owne; It onely rests in you to giue a blessing For confirmation. Rhetias. Sir, tis truth and iustice. Mel. The gods that lent ye to me, blesse your vowes: O Children, children, pay your prayers to Heauen, For they haue shew'd much mercy. But Sophronos, Thou art my Brother: I can say no more: A good, good Brother. Prince. Leaue the rest to time. Cousin Thamasta, I must giue you too: She's thy wife, Menaphon. Rhetias, for thee And Corax, I haue more then common thanks. On, to the Temple; there all solemne Rites Perform'd, a generall Feast shall be proclaim'd. The Louers Melancholy hath found cure; Sorrowes are chang'd to Bride-songs. So they thriue, Whom Fate in spite of stormes hath kept aliue. Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
