      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene: Paris. A Hall in the Royal Palace. Carloman is pacing backward and forward: he pauses by a crucifix set up at the further end of the hall. CARLOMAN. Thou sayest truly that I amâa King He said Who laid His life down on the Cross: So will I be, a King. I will possess The great reality. I war and govern, I can strike hard as Charles the Hammerer; Men say I have my father's qualities, And in the brief months of my sovereignty The infidel has recognised my blood: But this is nothing! Phantom-Emperors Have made the throne phantasmal. I have felt In Zacharias, the great Pope, a force That spreads like spring across the world. No more Will I be petty marshal to a crew That hack and murder, while the royal faces Of wandering martyrs scintillate and thrill. There is a glorious Betterness at work Amid the highways and the solitudes; I would be with itâin obscurity, No matter!âwith the river as it shapes Its cisterns in the hills or where the wind First draws its silver volumes to a voice: Behind, at the beginning, from within: A cry, a pangâwhat shall respond to it, Who help me? I have fiery thoughts of God, I would attempt Him. In the wilderness Maybe He will unbosom. [Enter a Servant.] SERVANT. The Archbishop Of Mentz would see you. CARLOMAN. BlessÃ¨d Boniface! He brings me my enfranchisement. [As Boniface enters the Servant withdraws.] Great Angel, My spirit leaps within me to be born, Beholding you. BONIFACE. My son, the Holy Father Receives you joyously. CARLOMAN. [kissing Boniface] To go to God Living, unscathed, to give Him everything One has, to pour one's soul into His lap, To let Him play upon one as the wind, To feel His alternations . . .! BONIFACE. Carloman, Your childlike transport shall be surely blessed: Yet in the convent there are bitter hours Of exile from God's presence, penancesâ CARLOMAN. But will they choke my solitude with prayers? BONIFACE. The holy brethren chant in unison For hours within the chapel; there is buzz About the cloister like a hive of bees. CARLOMAN. There have been hermits! Might I live alone, I could breathe unrepiningly the while It pleased God to keep silence. I would tame Some wistful, kingly beast to roam with me, And we would wait His pleasure. Boniface, Oh, tell me of His coming! It is plain He has been with youâYou became His friend? BONIFACE. His servant rather. CARLOMAN. That I cannot be; I am a Knight free-born; I come as those Great nobles of the East, and all my service Is adoration. You may have some converts, Brute-tribes, who give allegiance to His name, As those who do not speak the Emperor's tongue May rank his subjects. I am not of these. BONIFACE. Thou speakest truth, my son; there are some souls Loved of the Lord as Paul in Araby With whom one must not meddle. In good time You will exalt the Church; meanwhile your brother Who has a tighter grip of circumstance Than youâ CARLOMAN. He is short-sighted, politic, External in his bent. I lead the charge In battle, I foresee the combinations Of foreign forces; he is good at siege, And all the hectoring process of delay. He is not like my father. That great fight At Tours! I feel the onslaught in my blood; It never can run sluggish. BONIFACE. Had you seen King Chilperic's flower-wreathed waggon in the street!â You should have looked a last time on the world Ere you renounced it. CARLOMAN. Scanned the heir of Clovis Drawn like a senseless idol in his car! You judge unworthily. God bade me come Up higher to Him on a battlefield Where I was victor. It was in the nightâ I moved about among my sleeping men, I heard them shout for triumph in their dreams: It was enough! BONIFACE. Yes, all is vanity; The pride of life, its splendour, vanitas! CARLOMAN. There is no vanity in life; life utters Unsparing truth to us,âthere is no line Or record in our body of her printing That stamps a falsehood. Do not so confound, Father, life's transience and sincerity. What makes the show out in the streets so vile Is that it blazons forth the lie that youth, Kingship and power are ineffectual. A show of death where life should radiate Is vanity. And if I now fling off The honourable titles of my state, Consul and Patriarch, it is not because I have not nobly borne them; by my sword The Church has been defended, and the corn That bows in shocks about your monasteries Bows down above the battlefields I won. You misconceive. BONIFACE. A sweep of piety Beyond my censure! [half-aside] Will he thrive at Rome? CARLOMAN. Why should you look so fearful? I have chosen The path of life, choosing to be a monk, And I have wisely chosen. BONIFACE. Ah, beloved! CARLOMAN. Now I must face my brother. Would he come By chance! I dare not crave a conference. I am arrested at the lips if ever We speak of anything beyond affairs. He will not understandâat least to-day, When fresh from the procession of that cursed Do-nothing Chilperic. BONIFACE. Set your purpose forth At once, and let him freely misconceive: You must not cloud for that. CARLOMAN. These mighty thoughts, Mingled with God, how put them to the shame Of the world's censure! What you call my soul Flees as a shy girl that escapes pursuit. BONIFACE. Take your shame meekly. Do not let your eyes Grow wild and hostile! [Boniface, who has seen Pepin approaching, withdraws to the back of the hall, stands before the Crucifix in mute prayer, and then passes out, looking back at the brothers. Pepin is a short, stout man, with florid complexion and much vehemence of manner. He wipes the perspiration from his face and addresses Carloman without looking at him.] PEPIN. Woden, what a sight! This Chilperic is an idol that the people No longer worship as his car rolls on. Contempt, indifference! A few more months Will rid us of the calf. We pull together In right good part, fraternal, taking pride Each in the other's excellence: ere long The Pope will pour his oil upon our heads To nourish our short curls. CARLOMAN. He has the power Of making Kings? PEPIN. Liutbrand the Lombard winced Before him and resigned the Exarchite: And he who can impoverish may endow. CARLOMAN. [with a sudden movement] Pepin, we have not looked upon the face Of Zacharias: I am bound for Rome. PEPIN. A pilgrimage? Stay where you are! Tut, tut! Wait till he seek us. Frankland is his hope Against the Lombard: when he seeks us then We twain will offer him our dutiful, Strong swords, and keep St. Peter's realm intact; While, in return, that gracious influence, That something that we lack to give our strength Supremacy, shall be poured down on us. CARLOMAN. Something we lack! I dream of a possessionâ Pepin, the world if I became a monk Would recognise that I lay down my rights, None wrests them from me. PEPIN. Are you clean gone mad! Become a monk, you, Consul, Patriarch! Our mother had been Christian scarce a year Before your birth, and haply took the priest Too much into her privacy. By Thorâ CARLOMAN. [taking him by the throat] No, but by God Incarnate, you shall swear You own me son of Christendom's great guard Ere you again draw unimperilled breath! I, Carloman, your elder, the first-born Of Charles Martel, of my own choice renounce My portion in his honours. Own my birthright! PEPIN. Plague take you! CARLOMAN. Own it! PEPIN. Give a fellow breath, Don't . . . You have your father's temper, that's the test! I loved you as a boy and set my teeth Against a rare, sweet craziness that takes you In certain moodsâyou need a keeper then: You need one now. Hold fast your birthright, man; Don't trust me with temptation. Geneviva Will relish this new folly less than Iâ Chuck her beneath the chin and threaten her With your design! She is too young a widow For me to govern. CARLOMAN. [apart] Deaf down to the soul! PEPIN. That flush across your forehead like a scar At mention of your wife! Her lovers!âThink If you withdrew protection . . . CARLOMAN. Purity, In woman the ideal and the dream, Has its firm seat amid the altitudes Of manhood's natureâThere alone are seats Of holy contemplation, sexless thoughts, Love that in God finds goal, a loneliness That truth, not sympathy, can cure. 'Tis vain The hope that woman, made to minister To momentary passion, can provide Solace and inspiration to her mate. She breeds no hope; she cannot offer us A clime for our ideals and our dreams, Or plant a footstep soft as memory's Across futurity's unimpressed sands. PEPIN. You speak from fact, I own. But Boniface, What does he say? CARLOMAN. He aids me. PEPIN. [slapping him on the shoulder] Carloman, 'Twould be cold work without you. CARLOMAN. But my sonâ PEPIN. Nay, nay, no substitute! You are my brother, I know the secret how to humour you, I weave your projects in our policy, And now and then you marshal us the way Of an archangel . . . but no substitute! CARLOMAN. Yet love him for my sake; give him free training In war and letters. PEPIN. Fie, fie! Geneviva Will put you from this project. In the cloister What would you see but men who dig and pray?â No royal pageants. [King Chilperic is borne in a litter with great pomp. His golden hair sweeps over the sides of the litter; his face is nerveless and exhausted.] CARLOMAN. [with an ironic smile] Such as this. The King! Tell him I have transferred the Mayoralty To you, and do not taunt me any more. PEPIN. [to Chilperic] Sire, you are weary, yet we crave the grace Of a brief audience. CHILPERIC. Business! I can brook No more of these distractions. Your good brother Relieves me of all business. I can hear Scarcely the people's clamour when they shout, And I am shy at facing them. To know There is a god indifferent to its whims Gives the world courage of its natural awe; So I expose these curls; that duty done, Leave me at ease, an idol in his niche. PEPIN. But, sire, my brother has persuaded me, If you consent, to take on me his burthens, His duties and his honours; being summoned, He holds, by God to a monastic life. CHILPERIC. [with passing animation] This interests us. After so brief a term Of dignity! But I applaud his sense: The convent is a place for peace of mind; One has no interruption, one may watch The gold-fish in the fountain half a day, If so one will; and, though the prayers are long, One grows accustomed to them as to meals And looks for their recurrence. [suspiciously] But, my Consul, With you it cannot be the luxury Of doing nothing that attracts. For us It is the happy and predestined lot; But for an untamed youth whose pleasures still Are running in the current of his blood, Such choice is of ill-omen. CARLOMAN. Courage, sire, Is constant industry for happiness. When I become a monkâ CHILPERIC. Nay, no confession, No putting reasons to your Overlord. [to his nobles] You need not shake your spears so stormily, We leave you a stout leader for your wars, [to Carloman] And you, your liberty. What use of it You make is of no moment to the world, And does not raise my curiosity, Who for myself have found in meat and drink, In sleep and long, long abstinence from care The pleasure proper to me. Pepin, come! [Exeunt Chilperic, Pepin and the Frankish Nobles.] CARLOMAN. He has no sight of God, is imbecile And dropping into clay. I should not let This show dishearten me; but I have suffered A vulgar tongue to tell what from my lips Alone is truthâthat as the hidden spring, Restless at touch of the diviner's rod Is dragged through to the surface by his spells, I am discovered and borne upward, made The answer to some perilous appeal: And for my folly I must be dismissed By a mere dotard with a passing sigh Of envy, who forego the battlefield, The Council-chamber, the sweet clang of arms For just a pricking wonder at my heart, A knowledge I would give to secrecy Plunging it headlong in the ear of God. Oh for the cloister! I will make escape At once, in silence, without taking leave: My joy is in the consciousness that Time Will never draw me back to any wish To any fondness I am flinging off. . . . [Enter Geneviva.] My wife! Is Geneviva come to me? GENEVIVA. Now the dull monk has left you. Rouse your head! I have been taking thought how best to trim My beauty for you. Boniface was slow In giving counsel; slowly I took up, Handled and dropt my jewels. Of a sudden, When Pepin's voice was heard upon the stair, I laid these blossoms in a ruddy knot Thus hasty on my bosom. Come to me. My lord, you owe me many hours of love, So many hours I have been beautiful In vain. You do not see me when I sing, You miss the marks of music in my face, You do not love the hunt, and you have never Ridden beside me in the morning light. You see me but as now when I am vexed And haughty for caresses. CARLOMAN. [after a pause] Geneviva, You are a Christian? GENEVIVA. Dear my lord, you speak As if I were laid sick. CARLOMAN. You were baptised? GENEVIVA. Assuredly, but the cold font has left No chill upon my heart. Think not of that, Think of our marriage-day. You leave me lonely While Boniface enthralls you. CARLOMAN. [with hesitation] Women even Have put aside their pomps and vanities . . . GENEVIVA. Oh, leave me, you are insupportable! You bring me word of kingdoms and of monks, And thoughts of things that have not come to pass, Or should be quite forgotten. We could spend So sweet a moment now, for you are loved, My CarlomanâWhat need is there of talk Concerning other matters?âloved of me, Dreamed of when I am dreaming, when I wake Wept for, sighed after. I have never cared To listen to the minstrels, for the praise My beauty covets most is in your eyes. How wild they look and solemn! [Carloman folds her in his arms quietly. Then with great effort bends over her and speaks] CARLOMAN. Marcomir Is restless for a pilgrimage to Rome. I think we shall be starting presently: And afterward . . . If I am long away . . . GENEVIVA. [breaking from him] Oh, think a little! Can you leave this hair So crisp and burnished? When the sun is bright Across your shield, it has no livelier flashâ Confess, it has not? But you come to me Stale, weary from your dreams and abstinence, And tingle my suspicion. CARLOMAN. If these dreams Were growing all the world to me!âYou start, You turn away, you will not understand. The fear of hurting you has made me keep So distant from you lately, and my eyes You thought were worn with vigil and with books Have burnt with tears at night for many a month To think you have not known the tyrant-joy That moves a soul to change and severance, Except upon the day when for my sake You parted from your home: but by the rapture That made such tumult in the daughter's grief When she became a bride, your husband now Implores your comprehension. All thou hast, So the Church teaches, family and spouse, The child thou hast begotten, thine own life Thou must abhor, if thou would'st have new days Of blessing on the Earth. I feel this law Is written in my very heart of hearts, There is such haunting freshness deep below The sorrow of farewell. GENEVIVA. [defiantly] My God is Loveâ The God who made a bower in Paradise, Who wedded Eve and Adam, who abode In the sweet incense of His Church to bless My marriage. [Carloman stretches out his hand to support her.] Have no fear that I shall fall, I cannot swoon while I remember itâ How in the songful hush a restless hand Grew tight about my fingers, and a vow Thrilled all the girl in me to womanhood, And stung the future lying at my heart To joy and frankness. That was years ago . . . [She breaks into a bitter laugh] O Carloman, you know not what you do, You know not what I am, nor what a blank Of mercy there is in you! CARLOMAN. Were I dead, You would not be so violent: in a trance Of resignation you would think of me, With tears, not gasping laughter. GENEVIVA. [pacing the room excitedly] Pilgrimage! Did you say, pilgrimage? To think of you Growing each day more cramped about the mouth, More full of resolution in the eyes. What shall I do? Pray for youâbut the dead, You have just told me, should be left unmourned, Forgotten as last summer's autumn-leaves. [facing him coldly] My lord, I am no reliquary-urn; There is no widow in me. [with still greater change of manner] If you leave Your Kingdom, there are certain things to do Before you start. There is that Gothic King, The captive Hermannâyou must break his chains. CARLOMAN. Hermann is dead. Count Marcomir reports Last night he found him lifeless. GENEVIVA. [gasping] Late last night? Marcomir!âTake your fingers from my sleeve; But summon Marcomir, and if again There is intelligence to break to me Likely to hurt, give him the charge of it. CARLOMAN. No, Geneviva. I have little speech; But when the secret crept into my soul I loved you, it was not to Marcomir I spoke: and if another secret now Is breaking through my nature, do not think That he will be the spokesman. [noticing her agitation] Hermann died I think by his own hand; he courted death. What can a man prize in captivity? [as Geneviva grows more agitated] There! I will speak no more of him. Your maidsâ [turning to summon her attendants]. GENEVIVA. Weave the great arras. They have no concern With me, except in silence to array. You thought I cared to gossip with my maids! But summon Marcomir. [She looks after Carloman, who walks out, stroking his chin]. To think he dared To lean above me with those burning eyes Unconscious what they glassed. I did not learn From him the magic that was born in me, I learnt it when great Hermann passed in chains, And he is dead. I promised I would go To-day and visit him. How could he die? [Marcomir enters.] Why, you are deadly pale! [She recoils, and says in a faint voice] It is the hour Fixed for our visit. MARCOMIR. But the man is dead. GENEVIVA. What does he look like now? Is he so changed I must not see him? MARCOMIR. Death is not a fact To touch with simile. What looks he like? All men in moonlight mind one of the moon, All dead men look like death. GENEVIVA. He lies in chains? Are the brows restful? MARCOMIR. Had you been a man You would have asked me how he came to die, No more! GENEVIVA. I had forgotten . . . then he perished As Carloman reports? [Marcomir turns away.] You cannot bear That I should mourn him? MARCOMIR. [facing her again] Oh, a lifetime, if It please you! I am going to a place Where love is held of little consequence. GENEVIVA. Then you are bound for hell. MARCOMIR. [between his teeth] But you are safe! GENEVIVA. Keep me recluse from love, as men from war, You spoil my faculties. Where will you go? MARCOMIR. To any coast you have not trod, wherever The flowers are different from the flowers you wear, To some Italian convent. Geneviva, I am not framed to see you minister To other men; but when long years are passed, It may be in a fresco, I shall find Some figure of a lady breaking bread To mendicants, and kneel and pray to her That she may bless me also: but till then . . . [covering his eyes] O God, you shall not tempt me, though I feel Just how your hair burns in a fiery wreath Above your brow, and how your eyes are soft With blue, and deeper blue, as through the hills The valley stretches azure to the close. You shall not tempt me, though I almost hear Your bosom taking record of your breath, And I could sit and watch that tide of life Rising and falling through the lovely curves, Till I was lost in ecstasy. GENEVIVA. Oh, hush! But then you love me. It was in a fit . . .? MARCOMIR. Of devilish malice. GENEVIVA. In a jealous fit? You shall remain. [She goes up to him: he takes her hands in his, kisses them coldly, and puts them away.] MARCOMIR. I did not answer youâ His face was drawn. GENEVIVA. And I had given you charge Of the great restive soldier. MARCOMIR. True, I swerved; I have confessed my sin, and now must bear The settling of my spirit on the Cross. GENEVIVA. So many favours! MARCOMIR. But you kissed his browsâ What need was there of that? GENEVIVA. You love me then, You love me! Would you murder him again If I again should touch him with my breath? MARCOMIR. Again, again. GENEVIVA. And Carloman complains I am indifferent to him! MARCOMIR. He forgets; But, Geneviva, if a thousand years Broke over me, when Time had cleared his storms I should look up and know your face by heart. GENEVIVA. Then stay, stay, stay with me! Have you once thought Through the long years how it will fare with meâ Nothing to watch except the sullen waste Of my own beauty? Marcomir, I hold If there be judgment it shall be required Of women what delight their golden hair Has yieldedâhave they put its wealth to use, Or suffered it to lie by unenjoyed? I rather would die spendthrift, nothing left Of my rich heritage, save memory Of the wild, passing pleasure it conferred Than keep it untransmuted. And you choose To take from me the only eyes that care To mirror mine! I have so often thought That some day I shall drown myself: the water Reflects me with desire. MARCOMIR. [bitterly, as he turns away] A soul so wide In innocence, so regal, on the day He wedded, he appointed me your squire! GENEVIVA. [following him] He keeps you with him, you can read his heart, You know what way he travels, when his soul Flies homeward. Tell meâ'tis the only knowledge I crave for in the worldâdoes Carloman Still hold me in affection? I beseech, Tell me the truth. He loves youâ MARCOMIR. Yes, he loves, He does not use me for his purposes. [perceiving PEPIN] Not Carlomanâhis brother on the stair Laughs at your light behaviour. So you lose One last poor opportunity. [Re-enter Pepin.] PEPIN. Good even. Well, my fair sister, you have heard the news, Wept [glancing at Marcomir] and found consolation. But to think The son of Charles Martel should be a monk! GENEVIVA. A monk!âa pilgrim? PEPIN. No, a cloistered monk. MARCOMIR. What is his crime? PEPIN. Oh, no impiety; A crazy fit: he must get near to God, So puts away all intercourse with man: And while I rule he thinks to thrill the world With some convulsive movement from his prayers. Ha, ha! But you shall queen it as before. GENEVIVA. Go fetch my husband and remain without, For he alone can speak to me of this. [Exit Pepin.] [turning to Marcomir] You are a murderer: this act of yours Will leave me very lonely. MARCOMIR. I repent. GENEVIVA. There is no sin like that of looking back When one has sinned. Whatever one attempts If perfected in patience brings reward. My Carloman will prosper: his whole heart Is gone away from me. Why there he is, Passing in zealous talk with Boniface. [Carloman and Boniface cross from right to left at the back of the hall. Geneviva intercepts them.] Farewell! CARLOMAN. [arrested] O Geneviva! GENEVIVA. Not my name, Never my name again. Say, holy fatherâ They take new titles who renounce the world? CARLOMAN. [with flushing eagerness] Then you too will renounce it? oh, the joy! There is a strange new passion in your eyes. Speak to me . . . but you cannot! I could take No leave of you in your fierce, worldly mood; Now all is changed. GENEVIVA. Yes, all. How long ago It seems since we were married! CARLOMAN. Think the day Is yet to come, the joy is all before. [taking her face between his hands] O Boniface, this is no temptress' face! God has been with her, and she starts as I Free in the great endeavour. BONIFACE. Do you choose, Lady, a mere retreat among the nuns, Or, like your husband, do you break all ties That bind you to the earth? GENEVIVA. They all are broken: Except . . . oh, I forgot! I have a son. CARLOMAN. [nervously] Pepin will guard him. GENEVIVA. Are you dreaming still? Fool, fool! I tell you Pepin shall decide What robes I wear, and haply suffer me Sometimes at entertainments to look on, And see young Charlemagne praised. But for my child He shall remain with me. [Re-enter Pepin]. All is confirmed. I shall not quit the world. How easily A man is duped with God upon the brain! I shall continue in my womanhood, Giving, receiving pleasure. I have heard So much and suddenly; for Marcomir Is to become a monk. [to Carloman] Give him no welcome. He takes the cowl a penitent; he is not, Like you, a white-souled wayfarer. [to Pepin] How strange That we must pair together, you and I; I know so little of your tastes and now I must be often in your company. MARCOMIR. My lord, speak to her. PEPIN. Come, an end to this! Brother, if you are wise you will not leave This woman in the world. Convents are made To tame the pride of such and keep them cool. CARLOMAN. O Geneviva, for my sake, and yet . . . Not so, belovÃ¨d. [He turns away and covers his face.] GENEVIVA. Marcomir, farewell! You will be monks together. When my husband Forgets me, you must bring me to his thoughts Recall that day we hunted and you fell; I stayed to tend you; but the whole live day My voice rang through the woods for Carloman Until I wearied you; he was not found; But you remember how I cried for him. MARCOMIR. Consul, have pity on her. I am free, But she has need of love. GENEVIVA. O insolence!â The virginal chill heart!âNo intercession! [to Carloman] Our marriage is dissolved. How great a stranger You have become to me! I should grow mad To breathe by you another single hour. [to Boniface] And you, old man, who stand with such meek eyes, Though you have robbed me of my name of wife, And made my boy an orphanâgo your way! I cannot curse you, but I prophesy: Dishonour motherhood, plant virgin homes, Give to religion the sole charge of love, And you will rear up lust of such an ice As Death himself will shiver at. [to Pepin] Lead on! Now there is hope you may become a King, There should be some high festival to keep To-night in everlasting memory. Lead me away. PEPIN. Brother, in allâgood luck! And may the Convent's fare be angels' food. Your wife's tears soon will dry. [Exeunt Pepin and Geneviva.] CARLOMAN. The thing to do Is simply just the sole thing to be done. There should have been no tears, no taking leave; A freeman can do anything he will. MARCOMIR. Take me along with you. CARLOMAN. Ah whereâto God? Why would you come with me? MARCOMIR. You must not ask. Some rival slain in hasteâthe ebbing back Of hatred that has left the face exposed Of a dead foe I spared not. I have struck On something in my nature that is foul, That goes on breeding in me, that will taint My fellows: I must purify my heart With lonely fasting and continual prayers. My hope is all in Time: though Time defaces So much of what is fair, it dims the spots: I who am just a murderer to myself, Who close my eyes upon a sleeping guilt And waking, answer to the bloody name, Have some faint courage that a transformation Will come . . . CARLOMAN. Oh, do not put your trust in Time; Put on at once forever, leap to God! Have done with age and death and faltering friends, Assailing circumstance, the change of front That one is always meeting in oneself, The plans, the vacillationsâlet them go! And you will put on immortality As simply as a vesture. MARCOMIR. And you think Of startingâwhen? CARLOMAN. Now: we are on the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene: An audience-chamber in the old Lateran Palace, Rome. [Enter Zacharias and Damiani.] DAMIANI. And so the Lombard yielded . . .? ZACHARIAS. Not to me, But to my God. Each man of woman born Is fashioned in God's outer image: few Are so compact of Him they feel His strength Within their body as a force that pushes Its way and dissipates the hollow crowd Of godless men; but from my youth I prayed I might be like Him in my inward parts As in my form of dust: and there was nothing That stood against me. It was simple joy To meet the opposition of my foes, To meet triumphant wickedness, to meet The deadliest torpor; for they had an end As night and mist are ended by the sun. DAMIANI. You act on a dread thought. ZACHARIAS. The thought conceived, Life has no terrors. It is emptiness Alone that makes us timid and inert: Fill up the void, we go from strength to strength In our possession. When I worship God, The pyx upon the altar where He dwells Has not a closer hold on Him than I. DAMIANI. No wonder that men fear you in their hearts, And yield when you approach them! ZACHARIAS. But you questioned About my recent journey to the hills, That I might save Perugia from the craft Of Rachis, the vile Lombard King. I went And faced him . . . all his treachery gave way, The town was mine again; and more than this, All his ambition vanishedâat my feet He promised to renounce the world itself,â Like Carloman, the Consul of the Franks, Who left his wife, his honours and his home To dwell on Mount Soracte. DAMIANI. Carlomanâ His fame spreads every day. ZACHARIAS. I felt a warmth Myself to see the man, and when he came A welcome rushed out from my soul, such life Tempered the resolution of his face. God dwelt in himâyet fitfully it seemed, A fever in his blood, not constant health, Unalterable habit, as with those To whom God is the same now, yesterday, And always. As I blessed him I became Disquietedâhis long hands were never still. He needed discipline, such changeless hours As make the spirit stable. Now he seeks Another meeting, so this letter says, To ask me some petition for himself, And for his friend. DAMIANI. He leaves a noble brother, Religious and undaunted, in his place, Pepin the Mayor. ZACHARIAS. On whom I build my trust. I would that Rachis left upon his throne A brother who could stand by Carloman's: But Astolph has a rebel's countenance, The only eyes that never bent to mine. He looked upon me as a robber might Who saw in God's own altar but a setting To jewels that he coveted. And when Rachis knelt down and vowed to leave the world, And there was silence in the Lombard host, I heard a ringing laugh, and Astolph shook His yellow hair with joy. I never saw So mad a gestureâGod will strike him down! [Enter a Cardinal.] CARDINAL. The Lombard King would see you. ZACHARIAS. Lead him in, We will receive our penitent. [Exit Cardinal.] This Rachis Shall make your Convent famous: Mount Casino Shall have its royal monk. DAMIANI. A gracious thought. [Enter Rachis with two Cardinals.] ZACHARIAS. Welcome! You come to Rome to take your vow. RACHIS. I come to ask your counsel first. My father, I have no trust in Astolph, he is stubborn, Heretical, and will bewitch my people From all allegiance to your holy throne. I speak of certain danger. ZACHARIAS. Ah! RACHIS. I love you, I love the peaceful service of the cell, And each affection tears me bitterly: Yet for the sake of keeping my wild hordes Your servants, I am willing to renounce The pleasure of the cloister, if your wisdom Absolve me from my promise and restore me To Kingship over Astolph. [He watches Zacharias with the utmost anxiety.] ZACHARIAS. What you plead Is politic . . . but, stay, I rob the Church Of glory if I think of what is safe; God can protect His ownâthe fiercer battle, The heavenlier triumph. He received your oath, Not I. RACHIS. You are His Pope, you can remit . . . And you would rule in peace. ZACHARIAS. How dare you tempt The Lord your God, upon whose earthly throne I sit? Get from me! One short month ago You were yourself blaspheming in the land, A heretic like Astolph and a slave To your own lust. Begone! The convent walls Alone can save you. If you drop away There is no limit to the punishment God deals to such backslider; you become Perjured for all eternity. RACHIS. Alas, Is there no service that will soften God, Except the cloister? ZACHARIAS. Fool and hypocrite, There is no way to Him except the path A man's best moment finds, and you are lost If you regret your vowâto break from it Is utterly impossible: a star Can no more leave the music of its course Than any mortal break his word to God. Your soul is bound for ever. [Enter Carloman and Marcomir with another Cardinal.] Dearest son, I greet you with God's blessing, [to Marcomir] And on you Confer the same. How prospers Carloman? CARLOMAN. Oh, well, dear father. ZACHARIAS. He who keeps his knees Is Rachis, King of Lombardy. He takes Like you the fearful vow to be a monk. RACHIS. [to Carloman] Protect me, help me, holy Carloman; Let me return with you. I am distracted . . . A perjured man God will destroy in hate. CARLOMAN. Come with me, come . . . but not to make confession, To tabulate your crimes; come to the cloister, To solitude, the simple light of God. You must not dream, because your wickedness Has waked you to disgust, that you are called. The trouble is not betwixt God and sin; Sin does not shut God out, it is the lantern Flashing across the dark void of the worldâ Most penetrative pulses; use the flare For such poor revelation as it yields. But this new life . . . you must arise and go Toward it as disencumbered as of old Abraham went up to Ur, all his possessions Kept for him in a mystery out of sight. To dream of them is faith, and to forget All one has touched and handled, loved or wrought Of sin or righteousness, the perfect sign The new man is begotten. RACHIS. Pray for me, If you are in God's favour. Teach me how To win a better throne than I have lost, Safe from my brother, a perpetual seat High in the heavens. CARLOMAN. [with a ringing laugh] If that is your ambition, Oh then, how clear it is that you are damned, Wherever you may lodge! RACHIS. Haâterrible! You must not curse me; as the meanest slave I am content to cringe . . . CARLOMAN. And heaven detests A beggar's whining. God is made for Kings, Who need no favours, come to Him for nothing Except Himself. RACHIS. But does that satisfy? You who have borne the Convent many monthsâ ZACHARIAS. Yes, you can now bear witness to this poor Mistrusting wretch that you have no regrets. Speak out your true experience. CARLOMAN. [catching his breath] I am sad. [to Zacharias] I cannot speak with this petitioner Trembling beside me: give him judgment first, And then hear my complaint. ZACHARIAS. [sternly] No: let him hearâ What have you against God? CARLOMAN. I have not found Him. ZACHARIAS. You fast? You have been diligent in prayer? CARLOMAN. [more excitedly] I cannot prayâscarcely at Angelusâ The sun so flares and changes . . . in the cold East clouds there is such witness to His strength Ere he lay him down: the life, the passion Arrest me and I weep. ZACHARIAS. You cannot pray! But in the cloister. . . . CARLOMAN. Oh, those other prayers That I am set, I say them when I must, I sing within the chapel, dig and plant, And eat my portion; then there comes an hour, For which my heart has saved itself all day, When I can be aloneâsole preparation The spirit makes when she would be with Godâ I turn from Time's small dues of speech and habit To serve Eternity, the joy is coming That has no moment: and a noise is made, A monk approaches me, and I am summoned To visitors who seek me as a marvel To gaze upon. O father, when they look I reel with shame. ZACHARIAS. What would you? Such example As yours confounds the foolish. CARLOMAN. Grant my prayerâ Our prayers, for Marcomir's are joined to mineâ That we may leave Soracte and retire To some far convent hidden in the hills. ZACHARIAS. Wisely you ask the natural medicine Your state requires. Good prior Damiani, The brothers Carloman and Marcomir Together with King Rachis join your rule. Let them obey you, leading tranquil lives. [apart to Damiani] Firm discipline! RACHIS. [from the ground] O holy pontiff, grant That I may change with CarlomanâSoracte For me, if you are merciful. ZACHARIAS. Not so. This zealous son of ours has felt the poison Of worldly visits trouble him. MARCOMIR. [sharply] Sin needs A tomb in which to die. RACHIS. Fool! I am lost! [He throws himself again on the ground in despair.] CARLOMAN. We thank you, father, for we bound our hearts And brains and bodies with the fearful oath To live in God, and the great TempterâTimeâ Has thwarted us persistently with bondage Of interruption. Claims and trifles hinder Our worship of what passes not away; [vehemently] And I am chafed, my father. ZACHARIAS. There is something Terribly painful in your eyesâpray much, And think but seldom. [Enter another Cardinal.] CARDINAL. Saintly Boniface Comes from the Frankish Court. [He ushers Boniface in.] ZACHARIAS. A triple blessing On this most reverend head. You come from Pepin Or Chilperic? Here is Carloman. BONIFACE. Beloved, Why have you left Soracte? CARLOMAN. Visitors Wasted my leisure: I became a sight, Like some caged animal. ZACHARIAS. He leaves to-day For Mount Casino. BONIFACE. [to Carloman] You are happy? CARLOMAN. Yes . . . Oh, no, not happy; it is different: Not as you feel when you have won the goal, But as you feel when racing. BONIFACE. Do you care To ask no news of Pepin or . . . of . . .? CARLOMAN. No. [he turns away.] ZACHARIAS. What is your mission, good Archbishop? BONIFACE. Pepin Sends me to ask your blessing and to pray That you would place upon his head the crown That Chilperic seems to wear, but which, in truth, He, Pepin, owns unworn! ZACHARIAS. We have considered This matter on our knees before our God, And questioned what the power He lodged with us Might in such case attempt: we have been taught A glorious lessonâthat as Samuel made And unmade Kings, because God ruled in him, So we can put away the fainÃ©ant, Disgraceful Chilperic, and proclaim as King Pepin, our doughty servant. CARLOMAN. [starting] PepinâKing! [turning aside again] Why should this news so knock to enterâwhy? It seems to make me open a shut door: I see the Rhone, I see my father's roof, The gay French faces!âPepin, King! BONIFACE. I hear Your will with joy. It is a deadly peril To France that she is governed by a man No better than an image, golden-haired But lifeless as a stone. The very people Laugh at the word, a King. But all will change When Pepin's bulk of character extends The meaning of his office. CARLOMAN. Pepin, King! O Marcomir, you have heard it? MARCOMIR. Yes, I heard . . . No matter! He has ruled so long, the title Will fall on him as new years follow old. ZACHARIAS. [to Boniface.] We bid you see he is proclaimed; ourself Have hope to crown him when occasion brings Either the Frank to us or us to him. Although he want our oil, we give him grace To exercise all sovereignty, immuring Chilperic within the cloister where he dwells. CARLOMAN. [suddenly to Zacharias.] Oh, you can act for God, and I must pray; There is a distance from Him in my life Since I can only pray: while there is nearness Between your life and His creative Be! ZACHARIAS. [astonished] My son, what do you mean? BONIFACE. O Carloman! CARLOMAN. Pardon. I spoke aloud a scudding thought That filled my head one moment. So divine It is to act God's Counsel. ZACHARIAS. We can serve Him Only if stable, for the life of life Is calm as the untroubled sea and changeless. Go, follow Damiani, dearest son! BONIFACE Peace be to you, belovÃ¨d Carloman. My prayers, though often offered on the earth Of heathen lands, are yours at morn and night. I never can forget you. CARLOMAN. Pepin, King!â O Boniface, I think you said farewell. You journey far and far; you see strange faces, And woods where idols live in solitude, Hamlets and forges, feasts, the glare of arms, And great unpeopled plains so full of wind It seems the owner, while the little trees And grass are slaves: and thus you wander on God's messenger . . . Ha, ha! The little trees And grass! . . . Good-bye! BONIFACE. My childâ CARLOMAN. [gently] Yes, Boniface? BONIFACE. Nothing. I can but bless you. Go, in peace. [As Carloman moves away, Marcomir bends forward.] MARCOMIR. Is the Queen well? BONIFACE. Ask not; he has not asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III Scene: The Garden and Cloisters of Monte Casino. MARCOMIR. [striking himself with a stone] What tides of rapture spring at every stroke! Have mercy, God! Such agony of pleasure I felt when she came near. Oh, can it be I have not yet inflicted utter pain? Is there some chaste and vigorous suffering Beyond the shameful wiles, with which the lash Unnerves me? Pain, more pain! [He strikes himself without pity; then, seeing Damiani enter the court, he hurriedly drops the shard.] DAMIANI. Your hand is bleeding. I see!âAlthough I took away your silex You yet have braved my will. MARCOMIR. I need the rod. DAMIANI. You need obedience. Flog yourself again, You will be locked in prison like your friend. MARCOMIR. [in a low voice] He has no guilt. DAMIANI. No guilt! You have not heard I caught him flushed with triumph at the news That Astolph in defiance of the Pope Is laying siege to Rome. Good Rachis wept As well he might, but Carloman blasphemed Would I were with your brother! and for this I had him shut in darkness fourteen days. The term is over, and to change your sullen, Ascetic moodâit is a festivalâ You shall restore your friend to liberty. You err through over-discipline, a fault, But one that brings us honour; stubbornness Like his disgraces the whole brotherhood. Admonish him! If he is quite subdued He shall be suffered to resume his rank Among his fellows: for yourself, remember Humility is satisfied with penance The Church inflicts. No private luxury! Do not offend again. [Exit.] MARCOMIR. Not use the rod! Not use it when I feel incitements rapid As points of fire awake me to the knowledge That all my flesh is burning! Every flint Becomes a new temptation. How confess To him I love his wife, and guiltily! O Geneviva, do the swans still crowd Round you to feed them? Are you mistress still In the old palace? Can there be a doubt? If Pepin dare insult youâO this frock, This girdle, not a sword belt! And your husband Who brought you to such peril with his dreams, Let the light wake him! [Marcomir unlocks the prison-door, flings it open and draws back behind the trellis of vines.] CARLOMAN. What has struck my eyes? Is it the air, the sun, an open door? Oh, it is dark with brightness, and half-blinds, So rushing in! I would have been with God When the light broke in answer to His cry; I would have seen it pushing its broad leaves Through Chaos as it travelled!â MARCOMIR. [advancing] I am come To give you freedom. CARLOMAN. [seizing his hand like a boy] Are the throstles fledged I left within the orchard? MARCOMIR. They are gone . . . Besides, we must not wanderârecollect! CARLOMAN. I do; I was a goatherd on those hills Before my punishment [pointing to the prison]. How sad you look! Come with me; I will show you The flock of goats leaping from crag to cragâ And have you ever drunk their milk? It foams; Its thousand little bubbles seem themselves Full of an airy life, and in the smack Of the warm draught something exhilarates And carries one along. Come to the hills! MARCOMIR. Dear Carlomanâ CARLOMAN. These cloisters are so dull Where you sit brooding morn and eve; beyond One sees the clouds laying their restless fingers Across the scaurs. MARCOMIR. But is that meditation, And does one so find peace? CARLOMAN. The dew is there In the green hollows; when I see those steeped And shining fields, my heart fills to the brim, And, though I yearn, my yearning satisfies. Come with me: fast as I attain, with you I share the secret. MARCOMIR. But you strike me dumb. You have forgotten, we are bound by vows, By our obedience. CARLOMAN. Are we bound by hopes, By yesterday's lost hopes? MARCOMIR. But promisesâ CARLOMAN. I promised to be God's, ah yes, I promised, As two on earth agree to be together For evermore, vowed lovers. Is the marriage In the companionship or in the vow? Why, Geneviva is still vowed my wife. MARCOMIR. But we must keep our troth. CARLOMAN. We must escape From anything that is become a bond, No matter who has forged the chain,âourselves, An enemy, a friend: and this escape, This readjustment is the penitence, The sole that I will practise. [looking more narrowly at Marcomir] But your eyes Are witheringly remorseful. One would say That you had been some sunshines in the dark, You, and not I. Open your heart to me. MARCOMIR. I hate you. CARLOMAN. Hate me, why? For heresy? MARCOMIR. No, for your blindness: think what you have done, Think of . . . at least, think of your only child Mewed within convent walls. CARLOMAN. There is escape. MARCOMIR. What, for a child? CARLOMAN. [clenching his hand] Per Baccho, but my son Shall never wear a tonsure. MARCOMIR. Time will prove! You stand so free and noble in the light Yet it is you who brought me to despair. One cannot be a fool, one of God's fools, Unconscious of the ill in others' hearts, And not breed deadly mischief. CARLOMAN. I entreated You would not come with me. MARCOMIR. You drew me on; You cannot help it, you make life so royal Men follow you and think they will be Kings, And thenâ CARLOMAN. What ails you? MARCOMIR. Have you watched the lepers? Waiting outside the churches to be blest?â They pray, they linger, they receive their God, And yet depart uncleansed. Do not continue To question me, but listen. Bend your eyes Full on me! I have never told the Prior, I cannot; and I would not breathe it now But for her sake. The lady Geneviva Is spotless; but my thoughts have been defiled. I love her, I have never won her love, Must never strive to win it. It is hell To think of her. CARLOMAN. You never won her love? MARCOMIR. Never. CARLOMAN. She had so many favourites, Poor boy! and you were thwarted. MARCOMIR. But her bond, My deep disloyalty! CARLOMAN. No more of thisâ MARCOMIR. If I were in the world, it is to her I should return. CARLOMAN. The doors are strongly barred: There is no other hindrance. MARCOMIR. They are come The brethren and the prior: you must kneel And then be reinstated. I forgot. [Enter Damiani and a number of monks.] DAMIANI. Brother, we have great joy in your release, And hasten to embrace you. Own your fault Submissively, then rise and take your place In our rejoicing band. CARLOMAN. I will not kneel. DAMIANI. Respect your vow. CARLOMAN. But there is no such thingâ A vow! as well respect the case that sheathes The chrysalis, when the live creature stirs! We make these fetters for ourselves, and then We grow and burst them. It is clear no man Can so forecast the changes of his course That he can promise so I will remain, Such, and no other. Words like these are straws The current plays with as it moves along. DAMIANI. My brethren, do not listen; he is mad. CARLOMAN. No, you are mad; you cannot see that Time Is God's own movement, all that He can do Between the day a man is born and dies. Listen a little: is there one of you Who looks upon the sunlight and the buds That moss the vines in March, and does not feel Now I am living with these changeful things; The instant is so golden for us all, And this is life? Think what the vines would be If they were glued forever, and one month Gave them a lawâthe richness that would cease, The flower, the shade, the ripening. We are men, With fourscore years for season, and we alter So exquisitely often on our way To harvest and the end. It must be so. DAMIANI. Is this what darkness and strict punishment Have wrought in the corruption of your mind? CARLOMAN. I lay as seeds lie in the prison-house, Dying and livingâliving evermore, Pushed by a spark of time to join the hours, To go along with them. A MONK. But, brother, this Is overwhelming. MARCOMIR. Sin, can that be dropped? CARLOMAN. Never, there is no need. Life seizes all Its own vile refuse, hurries it along To something different; religion makes The master-change, turning our black to white; But so, as from earth's foulness, the stem drains Corruption upward, and the cleanly flower Waves like a flame at last. MARCOMIR. O Carloman, My brother, I am saved! [The monks press round Carloman tumultuously.] CARLOMAN. But all of you Be saved, and on the instant! Yes, the prior, You all of you, do not believe me mad. It is your misery, I think, that more, More than the urgent torment of my soul Has brought me to the truth, the healing truth That we must give our natures to the air, To light and liberty, suppressing nothing, Freeing each passion: we have slaves within, So many slaves, and I have learnt that saints Have dungeons that they dare not look into, The horror is so deadly. Force the locks, Let the fierce captives ravage. Better far Murder and rapine in the city-streets, Than lust and hatred's unfulfilled desires! Be saved; strike free into the worldâcome out! Oh, you can do itâI have spoken truth, I see that by your faces. OLD MONK. [touching Damiani's shoulder] Surely, prior, We must arrest this traitor. DAMIANI. [in a whisper] Half the brethren Are in the chapel: I will bring them down In mass on these insurgent novices. [aloud] Children, I leave you: wrestle with temptation; I now can only aid you with my prayers. When you have heard him through, decide; and either Lead him in chains to me; or if his lies Prevail with you, then put me in your prisons, And let the devil rule. [to Carloman] Now do your worst With your blaspheming tongue. [Exit.] OLD MONK. We should be fools To listen to himâit is mutiny; And there are walled-up dungeons. CARLOMAN. No, the hills For all, if all are reckless; it is just The one that fears who is the traitor-foe Imperilling brave men. 1st MONK. But how break free? CARLOMAN. How? All of us march with a single mind Making a strong procession from the gates. 2nd MONK. The Church has soldiers: whither could we go Unarmed and with an angry multitude . . . 1st MONK. Whither? 3rd MONK. Besides we are not of one mind Now he stops preaching; it was like a spell. 4th MONK. The heretic! OLD MONK. Tush! 'Tis the kind of frenzy That seizes every novice. Carloman, Will you not hear my voice? CARLOMAN. No, good old monk, God's servants must not listen but to Him. You have grown comfortable as the years Rolled on,âno matter. What the novice suffers, What every novice suffers, speak of that. OLD MONK. I have forgotten it. CARLOMAN. You can forget What you have suffered; then 'tis waste of time To listen to you. What we suffer once In youthâin childhood and our secret youth, We suffer to our grave. [turning to another monk] Have you forgotten? 1st MONK. No, but the pain is numb, so long ago My parents spoilt my life to have their will; I must endure the best they could conceive, And save their souls. CARLOMAN. If you should lose your own! A curse on parents! The one truth that led me To seek the cloister was my certitude A man's existence lodges in himself And is not owned by kindred. OLD MONK. Gently, brother, You had your way, and made yourself a monk; Now you are all for changeâso is the world For bitter change. 1st MONK. My mistress has been married, And would but laugh at me. OLD MONK. Time works such wonders If we will give him time to work them in. 1st MONK. It is too late. CARLOMAN. A maxim for the dead. It never is too late for any seeing, For any recognition we are wrong. It is a man's despair, not his confession Proves him contemptible. Too late, you say, Too lateâbut there are countries where 'tis spring And harvest many times within the year. Besides, we must not tarry in a place The moments do not wash with dew; we wither, Death has his secret will with us. Believe! Act on the instant. OLD MONK. The high gates are barred, And yonder is the Prior. [Damiani, with Rachis and a large troop of monks, is seen coming from the Chapel.] CARLOMAN. The gates are strong; But you and I and all of us can pass Through them in simple triumph if we willâ With one consent. Why, they are opening now! How gloriously! Armed riders! [Enter Astolph with a band of Lombard soldiers.] MONKS. Miracle! A sign from God. CARLOMAN. Not one of you shall come. What, flocking to my side because a door Turns on its hingesâshame! ASTOLPH. Where's Carloman? DAMIANI. [advancing] Who asks? ASTOLPH. The King of Lombardy. Give place! CARLOMAN. My saviour! ASTOLPH. Are you Carloman the Frank? I like youâyes, your face is eloquent. You do not keep your eyes upon the ground, Like this dear relative. CARLOMAN. [staring fixedly at Astolph] You glitter so, You glitter like the golden Vines, your hair Is gold, your armour full of spokes and rays. ASTOLPH. And you are muffled in a sackcloth-bag; The contrast strikes you. [to Damiani] Lunatic? DAMIANI. And worseâ A rebel, an apostate, noble prince, For whom I bring these manacles. ASTOLPH. And I An extra horse; for, lunatic or sane, I must have speech withâ [turning to Carloman with a laugh] Do you know your name? We who are kings and soldiers know it well, And Christendom remembers. Ah, I see! You are not happy, so they call you mad. RACHIS. Have you no word for me? I am a King, A King discrownedâand more, you have my crown. Are you grown sick of it? ASTOLPH. My dear old Rachis, Do not look covetous! I am not come To take you from your prayers. RACHIS. You think you triumph, But when you roll your thirsty tongue in hell, And see me in the peace of Abraham's bosom, Watching your painâ ASTOLPH. To every dog his day! [with a shudder] Ah, thenâmeanwhile there is a blowing wind, And all the world to ravish . . . Carloman, We are the brothers now . . . [to Damiani] Yes, I and this [Rachis sneaks off, hissing curses.] Fraternal soul, your madman. DAMIANI. Do you need An interview? ASTOLPH. I take it, thank you. Glance A moment at my soldiersâand retire. [They all withdraw.] Come to the well, where we can sit and talk, And I can have a draught. [He looses his helmet and dips it in the well. Carloman puts both hands round it as soon as it is full of water.] CARLOMAN. Wait! [drinking] Cool and strong! That prison-stuff was stagnant. Sunshine's warmth, The cool of water, how they both refresh! [looking up with a smile] Now, brilliant one, your business? ASTOLPH. Will you leave The Monastery? CARLOMAN. At once. ASTOLPH. You have no terror? You will not creep back, conscience in your nerves? CARLOMAN. Let me but pass the door. ASTOLPH. [laughing] You see it swings. I left it open. CARLOMAN. Then we start at once. ASTOLPH. [checking him] No, stay a little. Are you still the friend Of Zacharias? CARLOMAN. He is great. ASTOLPH. No doubtâ And most sagacious, for he seeks your brother To win him with the bribe of sacred oil As vassal and ally against myself. I started here from Rome the hour I heard That Zacharias had crept out by night To travel northward and defeat my hopes. You must arrive before him! I am come Sure, from report, that you will help my cause, You, who have been a ruler. I contend No supernatural power should have control Of lands and cities, troops and civil rights, Matters distinct from God, as from the world The service he requires. Life is so easy If we will keep it humanâquarrel, murder, And then make friends: we have so short a time To sin together . . . but this hate deferred, These pestilential menaces!â CARLOMAN. The Pope Shall never injure France! ASTOLPH. It lies with you To break the threatened treaty. You have owned Power over Pepin? CARLOMAN. Yes; tho' tardily, He followed all my counsels. ASTOLPH. Ride, and stop This treaty. If you ride you will forestall The Pontiff's slower march; and I meantime Will press the siege of Rome . . . you must not mind The ache of stiffened muscles. CARLOMAN. Hills and plains And treesâthe olives, cypresses and vines; Then France with nuts and poplars! But you keep me In one great palpitation. ASTOLPH. Zacharias, Besetting me from north and southward, crushes My strongest forces. What a splendid thing For the old man to travel in the heat So far to work my ruin! CARLOMAN. But the world Is for the young, my Astolph. ASTOLPH. Carloman, I love you. Why, I feel a lad, eighteen, When looking on you. Come, we two must kiss; We may not burn together, flame in flame, Againâso we must kiss. CARLOMAN. My blessed one, Would I could cleave to you! You give me freedom, A gift so rarely thought of. ASTOLPH. [calling a monk] Fetch the Prior, The brethren, nowâthis instant. We must start. CARLOMAN. Grant me beside the freedom for myself Salvation for another. ASTOLPH. What, a monk Still half of you! Such trouble for men's soulsâ But have your wish. Once on the battlefield, Men will become your prey. This solid jaw Means grip you will not loose. O Carloman, If I can circumvent the Pope, and then Stretch him a bleeding quarry at my feetâ CARLOMAN. What, Zacharias! But I plead for France; Popes must not meddle with her. ASTOLPH. [as the Prior and Monks re-enter] I require The services of Carloman: another Whom he will choose attends him. DAMIANI. Impious wretch, You steal from God His servants! [Astolph laughs and moves up the courtyard to summon his men: Damiani and Rachis talk to each other; the monks listen in a scared group.] CARLOMAN. [drawing Marcomir to the front] Marcomir, Come from this graveyard. MARCOMIR. No, I must not come, I dare not; she is yours. CARLOMAN. Is mine? You wrong herâ Not yours nor mine. Earth's wisdom will begin When all relationships are put away, With their dull pack of duties, and we look Curious, benignant, with a great compassion Into each other's lives. MARCOMIR. It is not so I look; I have a lust to gratify, A lust for very shame I loathe to mix With Geneviva's image. CARLOMAN. Faugh! because You think that I possess her! Cursed bonds, Cursed law that makes this riot in the heart! Come forth; all will be gentle out of doors. Gird up your habit. MARCOMIR. She?â CARLOMAN. Is but herself, O Marcomir, we tarryâand the leaves Are tossing through the airâ [Astolph throws his scarlet riding-cloak over Carloman, who seizes Marcomir with an impetuous movement and draws him toward the horses that champ at the gate.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV Scene: The Hall of the Frankish Palace. Early morning; the remains of a banquet on the table, drinking-cups, wine bottles, faded leaves. [A Servant is wiping away the stains of wine from the floor.] SERVANT. It is a cheerful thing to make all clean When one is brisk and cool: this early air Before the sun gets up is fit for men To breathe when they are working. Spot on spot! A stranger to the revel of last night Would take it there had been a massacre To daub the floor so thickly. [Enter another Servant.] 2ND SERVANT. What a strew Of glass and muddy wine-drops! Come up close And listen. There's a curious monk outside Who asks to see the Kingâalmost a beggar, And yet a red embroidered riding-cloak Flaunts round his ragged sackcloth; while his voice Has such a wanton ring we need not trouble Lest he should take the scandal of this room Too much to heart. The jolly soul can pipe! [A voice is heard richly humming.] Wine is for drinking, Glasses for chinkingâ Fellowship, pleasure, Of the full cup: Lift it up, lift it up! And let us be gay and be friends without measure. 1ST SERVANT. A monk indeed! Why we must drink again! A minstrel! 2ND SERVANT. And his comrade took the horses As he had been a squire. 1ST SERVANT. Oh, but the song! I never heard another one like this. 2ND SERVANT. Man, they are all the same: but then he sings it As if he had just learnt that grapes have juice, That makes it sound so well. You're pouring wine? 1ST SERVANT. Yes, he must drink for that. Ho, there again! Have you not caught the line? [They join in as the voice sings] These are the treasure Of the full cup; Lift it up, lift it up! And let us be gay and be friends without measure. Ha, ha! 2ND SERVANT. Come in! [Enter Carloman.] You praise deep drinkingâyou . . . For shame! A churchman! But . . . How thin! 1ST SERVANT. What eyes! CARLOMAN. Shall I have long to wait? Is Pepin ill, Or is he grown luxurious? I would say That I remember how your King is famed For industry. He does not lie abed? 1ST SERVANT. No, father. CARLOMAN. Call me brother if you will. Why do you choke with laughter? I am ready To laugh with you, to laugh to very tears At what I am and have been. Do not hide A thing so good and bright as laughterâEh? 2ND SERVANT. Mad! It were best to leave him to himself. [They draw back.] CARLOMAN. [Looking round the room] Throw the door wide open. Here we need Fresh air even more than water. How the wine Cries from the groundâshut in with walls, and cast Below men's feet, a slough where animals Might wallow, and so sour! Let in the breeze. Let in the dawn outside there! 1ST SERVANT. [propping the door] After all He is abstemious and sad at sin. Look how profoundly sad! 2ND SERVANT. Such twins of temper Are frequent with the crazy. Now he drops His mantle, have you ever seen such limbsâ A very scare-crow's! 1ST SERVANT. But a kindly smile. 2ND SERVANT. He touches things and lifts them up and down Just like an idiot. We must warn the King. [Exeunt. CARLOMAN. A feast, how nasty! Dabbled vine-leaves, vessels Broken to shivers, the inspiring juice Black on the boardsâa feast! Can happiness Leave refuse such as this? It visits slaves, And then its track is loathsome. Ah, the air Has entered like a wedge, keen, reaching me Through all the mustiness . . . and now I breathe! The door is not enough, the windows too . . . [opening one] There! How it enters! [turning toward another window] In this room I lived; It is not altered? No, the fireplace, east; My chair in front, and hers . . . but they are crowned At present; and my name upon that bench. It is more terrible than nightmareâthis Besieging of one's life by chairs and walls And memories. Ah yes, the walls, the walls, They do the mischief; and this reek of age From every corner sickens worse than stale Imprisoned fumes of wine. More air! [He throws wide all the windows: then leans out of the last. While his back is turned, Geneviva staggers drowsily in, reels to the board, tries to drink, then flings herself against the throne sleeping.] O Earth, How beautiful to think I travelled on And on, yet rode against no wall, so freely The outworks of your sky gave up their space. My brain is tired with interest: what men do Or speak enthrals me, I who often paced This room as blind to anything alive As if a child unborn. [Impulsively beginning to pace.] And yet, my God, How great a Captain thou wilt have in me If this bond-King, this Pepin can be freed; If I can do this thing, while Astolph batters The very gates of Rome. [pausing at sight of Geneviva.] But who is this Strange, beautiful, wild woman? Oh, how delicious Her arms, her bosom! Through the sodden hair, Trailing the ground, what glitter, and how clean This naked shoulder lies against the floor. Why, this is Sleep itself! [He comes close.] O Geneviva, So you too have learnt freedom, and are grown How marvellous in beauty!âMarcomir!â [Marcomir stands at the door.] He must not see her drunken and so flushed; He shall not. [moving quickly to the door] I am looking every moment For Pepin; do not enter. [Marcomir turns and goes out.] Oh, my shame, If she should open her gray eyes on me, And find me frocked and tonsured . . . for the sun Strikes sheer across her face. [He bends over her; she wakes, looks up, laughs in his face, and then speaks.] GENEVIVA. So young a guardian! Most holy father, but I am not dead; Do not bring rosemary, or sprinkle me With holy drops. [rubbing her eyes] They call this morning sleep A beauty sleep. You must not stare so hard. CARLOMAN. But do not laugh. GENEVIVA. I must; you are a monk Shame-faced and awkward. [rising] Have you travelled far? CARLOMAN. I came on embassy: the Lombard King . . . GENEVIVA. These kings and princes! But whoever rules Young men must have their pleasure. You and Iâ Shall we not drink together? [She pours wine into a gobletâhe drinks] God, what thirst! Now you must rest awhile. CARLOMAN. Who are you, lady? GENEVIVA. So should a novice lisp. I am a woman. CARLOMAN. Glorious! GENEVIVA. And you? [she laughs.] CARLOMAN. Oh, do not jest with me; You bring a devil to the paradise It is to gaze on you. I am escaped From convent-walls, the wrong, the bitterness! GENEVIVA. These monks are cruel, cruel, and I shudder At their embrace; yet if I have a joy It is to bring their manhood back to them. Ha, ha! To see them look the murderer's guilt After a moment's pleasure in my arms. You shall not slip me. CARLOMAN. I have left the convent A novice, as you say. But who are you So terrible in pity that you touch My hand and draw me to you, though my habit And shaven hair insult you worse, more grossly Than the most wanton bearing you have met In any other man? I am ashamed That you should see me thus. GENEVIVA. My dearest lovers Forsook me to be monks. You are as one That comes to bring me tidings of the dead, The holy dead who have no evil thoughts Or trouble from temptation. [She laughs bitterly] For their sakes You are beloved. CARLOMAN. Then put away all speech: When love draws on me put it by as scholars Their task when night falls thick upon the page. Bend over me and kiss me. Do not laughâ I love you. GENEVIVA. Did you ever love before? CARLOMAN. Never. GENEVIVA. Then I must tell you who I am: A harlot . . . in my palaceâDo not wince! [she looks at him doubtfully] I had a husband counted me a temptress And fled: I laugh now to remember it. I loved once; he I loved became a monk, And therefore I make sport of holy men. I would not scoff at you, not tempt you even. You have deep, burning eyes. CARLOMAN. He was a monk? His name, who fled you? Would you have your pleasure With me, his name! GENEVIVA. [to herself, shaking her head] He had oblivious eyes! [vindictively] My lover's name was Marcomir. CARLOMAN. The monk Who journeys with me on this embassy Is Marcomir. If you are amorous still Of him . . . GENEVIVA. Not nowâno more. I am afraid . . . Who are you? You are surely of my race, Have known me in my youth. A flushing shame Breaks on meâ CARLOMAN. And to find you are beloved Moves you? GENEVIVA. Not that! I hear it every day. It is too stale a story. Could I loveâ CARLOMAN. [Observing Marcomir passing and re-passing 'the windows] How dare he watch us! But I recollect You told me he had been your paramour. GENEVIVA. You come . . . he comes, I mean, from Mount Soracteâ Then . . . yes, I will have speech with him. CARLOMAN. [bitterly] Oh, gossip, The convent's gossip. I can furnish that. If you desire him carnally, I yield; But if . . . GENEVIVA. He knows so much of long ago. CARLOMAN. [impulsively] Then he shall speak. GENEVIVA. Not now; you must not call! Not now; for he remembersâ CARLOMAN. Ay, the harlot Was once a girl, the monk was once a man. If you would speak of life Before it was apprenticed to these tradesâ Of life and youth, virginity and love, My ear will be as ripe for your confession As his. We all remember; but our wisdom Is to forget: our powers of penitence Must be enfranchised, sin itself set free, No clog or fetter on us! GENEVIVA. Carloman, My husband! CARLOMAN. Your free lover. Oh, I burn, Burn toward your beauty! How can you forgive The years I simply owned you! GENEVIVA. Am I sweet, So sweet to youâthese lips so many men Have kissed, this body. . . . But you bid me speak Of life and youth, virginity and love, And by a miracle I can. We two Can argue of such matters. [As Marcomir passes she calls] Marcomir! [She restrains Carloman and goes to the door.] No, I must summon him. [Marcomir enters.] Were we not happy, Those days we sat together quite alone Praising and talking of him? We adored, We each adored him, but we had no part In that lone heart of his. Now all is changed He loves meâ MARCOMIR. Lady Geneviva! GENEVIVA. Noâ The harlot, loves the harlot. You can tell me So much of him. What, with him every day!â All through the golden summer and no rain, All through the autumn and its violence! Did he fall sick of fever? MARCOMIR. I have known So little of the seasons. Day and night I prayed that God would keep you chaste. No prayer Of mine was ever answered. CARLOMAN. [to Marcomir] Dare you pray That this should be or that? The only prayer That is not futile in impiety Is like a plunge beneath a river's flow To feel the strength and pureness of the life That courses through the world. GENEVIVA. Ah, yes, to bathe, And then to rise up clean. [to Marcomir] The very moment He spoke of youth, virginity and love I prayed: I am alive. O Marcomir, And there are other words of fellowship, Of joy and youth-time. Let us hold him dear Because he has delivered us; together Let us give thanks, give courage each to each Unenvious; let us talk of him once more, Though with a differenceâI will not use Your comradeship profanely as I did, To set you up against him in caprice, Then leave you wild and empty. He has much To pardon; you have more. MARCOMIR. No, no! CARLOMAN. Ah, noâ Not pardon. Where's the need? We mortal men Are brought to riot, brought to abstinence That we may grow on either ready soil The mustard-seed of pleasure, that is filled With wings and sunny leaves. As time goes by We shall have true relations each with each, And with clean hearts receive the usufruct Of what is best, and growing better still In every soul among us. [leading her up to Marcomir] Geneviva, His kiss will free your penitence, and teach you He never could regret the past, because It made to-day. MARCOMIR. [kissing her] Now, and beyond, beyond Your friendâand lover. I have prayed, like you, The difficult is possible as once. O life, O Geneviva, I were doomed Indeed, if I should dare to rob myself Of all the joy it is to be with you; That were to die forever. What, reject The gift you have for me, because for him You have a different gift! But take my passion, As I shall learn to take your friendshipâeach Accepting what the other has to give, All will be well between us. [Enter Pepin.] PEPIN. Holy brothers, At last I join you. Come, this is unseemly . . . A pleasant dameâbut not within my palace Shall you be tempted to forsake your vows. [to Geneviva.] Go, get your lovers on the highway; here You bring disgrace. [to Carloman in a low voice) A courtesan. CARLOMAN. My wife. PEPIN. Thor! are you crazy? CARLOMAN. And I trusted you, I left her in your charge. Where is my child? PEPIN. Dead in the cloister half a year ago . . . That was no fault of mine. As for your wifeâ CARLOMAN. [to Marcomir] Take Lady Geneviva to her rooms, Her rooms within the palace. [to Geneviva, as she goes from him] So our boy Is dead! Can you forgive me? [He shudders and bows his head. Exeunt Marcomir and Geneviva.] PEPIN. On my oath, I could not be her keeper, Carloman. CARLOMAN. No, that is no man's office. Of herself She was what she has been, and each of us Should say no word against her to our shame, Nor any word to one another more Than what we just have said. These fearful things Should be within a fosse below all speech; While we live sound above them and forget. I come to you. . . . PEPIN. The same, magnanimous, My brother, as of old. [laying his hand on Carloman's shoulder] What bones! CARLOMAN. Ah, yes. I have not flesh as full of life as yours; Why, your mere touch can warm one like the sun. PEPIN. Six years ago! You come as if the dead Could rise and make a visit. CARLOMAN. [gasping] Pepin, hush! I have been dead, and yet I am no ghost; You strike me through with anguish. PEPIN. But you suffer Unnecessary pain. I give you welcome With all my heart; yet you yourself must know Your presence in the place where once you ruled Isâwell, unlooked for. CARLOMAN. [vehemently] Brother, I can prove I am no spectre, outcast from the fortunes Of breathing men,âthat I too have a part Once more in worldly business. I am come. . . . PEPIN. [close to him] What are you come for? CARLOMAN. I am come to live, To share again your counsels. PEPIN. You are come For what? CARLOMAN. Once more to think of France, and act As you and I determine. PEPIN. Willingly I hear advice; but now the throne is mine Decision rests with me and not with you, Who have been shut away from everything But prayers and convent-policy. Forgive, We are no longer equalsâyou a Saint, I a mere statesman. But you have not said One word about the cloister. CARLOMAN. Do we waste Much talk on vaults, we men who are alive? PEPIN. And yet you chose it! CARLOMAN. Now I choose again. PEPIN. You cannot. Are you mad? Who sent you here? CARLOMAN. Astolph the Lombard. PEPIN. Humph! What prelate gave Authority to him? He could not use Your services by force. CARLOMAN. I left the convent At his request alone, in opposition To bishop Damiani. I am free! I proved it, acting freely. PEPIN. Whew!âthis Astolph . . .? CARLOMAN. Would save you from alliance with the Pope, Alliance with a foreign tyranny, Opposed to human life and thwarting it. Astolph is on your borders, and a King Is more your natural fellow than this Pope, Who seizes on the natural power of Kings, Confusing his tiara with their crowns. I speak the truth, for Zacharias travels In haste to put his yoke on France and you. Before he can arrive . . . PEPIN. The Pope is here. CARLOMAN. Impossible! PEPIN. He reached us yesterday. CARLOMAN. Pepin, you are in league with him? PEPIN. I am. CARLOMAN. As you are wise and manly, break your promise; It injures France, the freedom-loving plains, The aweless stock we come of. Will you give The future of your people to a priest, You who profess the tonsure round my head Disables for a crown? PEPIN. I, break my treaty, And ruin my whole scheme! CARLOMAN. The Pope is gray, And Astolph young and sound in force as you. Which is the deadlier foe? PEPIN. The Pope and I Are age and youth together. Carloman, I love you still; you take me at the heart Now that your face is glowing: I must speak, For either you are mad, or have forgotten How deeds are judged here in the actual world. You are a monk, a runaway, and worseâ A heretic blasphemer, one who tempts Both to rebellion and to perjury, Yourself as disobedient as forsworn. You must go back and bear your punishment Without the least delay; for you are lost If Zacharias find you here. CARLOMAN. Go back! Go back! PEPIN. You are a danger to yourself Remaining, and a danger to my throne. All I have said is true. Have you not broken Your vow? CARLOMAN. I have. PEPIN. And are you not a rebel? CARLOMAN. I am, I am, because I am aliveâ And not a slave who sleeps through Time, unable To share its agitation. What, go back! You might as well dismiss me to the womb From which I was delivered. PEPIN. Of yourself You left the world. CARLOMAN. [trembling] O Pepin, the same mother, Gave us our lives, and we had worked and thought And breathed in common till I went awayâ PEPIN. We cannot any more. Why will you fix A look so obstinate and hot? By heaven, you are a fool. I cannot change Myself, nor you, nor what has come to pass I soon shall hate you, wish that you were dead. CARLOMAN. How horrible! I never will go back; But I can live without my brother's love, For ties are not existence. PEPIN. Will you raise Divisions in my kingdom? CARLOMAN. I must live. [Enter Pope Zacharias, Boniface and a number of Churchmen and nobles.] PEPIN. [to Zacharias.] There stands my brother and your enemy. ZACHARIAS. Who?âCarloman? You wrong him. But what mission Has brought him to the palace? PEPIN. He has left His convent, and is here to plead the cause Of Astolph, the arch-heretic. ZACHARIAS. My son, Defend yourself. CARLOMAN. [putting his hands over his brow as if in confusion] But I can never say What he could comprehend. How strange to feel So slow, as if I walked without the light, Deep in a valley. [Boniface touches him] Ah! BONIFACE. You do not listen! Beloved, the Pope is speaking. CARLOMAN. [to Boniface] But you know What drove you forth to wander foreign lands, With joy in every limb and faculty: That drove me from the convent. BONIFACE. As a monk I left the English cloister, with a blessing From him who ruled me. Is it as a monk, Oh, is itâthat we see you in our midst? CARLOMAN. No, no, enfranchised! [suddenly standing forth] Hear me! The I am Has sent me to you and has given me power To rend your idols, for you have not known The God I worship. He is just to-dayâ Not dreaming of the future,âin itself, Breath after breath divine! Oh, He becomes! He cannot be of yesterday, for youth Could not then walk beside Him, and the young Must walk with God: and He is most alive Wherever life is of each living thing. To-morrow and to-morrowâthose to-days Of unborn generations; the I am To none of them a memory or a hope, To each the thirst, the wine-cup and the wine, The craving, the satietyâmy God! O Holy Father, you who sway the world Through Him, must not deny Him. ZACHARIAS. I deny! God does not alter; you have changed to Him Who is Eternal. CARLOMAN. Yes, in change, and free As we are free who move within His life, And shape ourselves by what is moulding Earth And men and ages. In my cell I lost The motion of His presence. I was dead. ZACHARIAS. No, you are dead to what you dare blaspheme, To what the cloister holds, if any place Can hold it, the immutability Of God's inherent nature, while without His words are trying men by chance and change And manifold desires. You left His works Behind, you chose Himself: your oath was taken To His deep heart; and now you would forswear That oath, you cannot. No one who blasphemes The light of God shall see the light of day: For him the darkness and for him the grave. I am no more your father, but your judge, Who represents the God you have disowned, Insulted and forgotten. He requitesâ And you shall answer to the uttermost. CARLOMAN. I can. ZACHARIAS. You still persist in carnal thoughts, Confounding Deity with things that pass? CARLOMAN. God is the Movement, if He is the Life Of allâI live in Him. ZACHARIAS. You left the convent Against command? CARLOMAN. Against command of men. ZACHARIAS. And leagued with Astolph? CARLOMAN. In fast brotherhood. ZACHARIAS. You hear his full confession. O apostate In vain, weep at your sentence. PEPIN. Holy Father, I pray you send him back, but spare his lifeâ Spare him, if I have power with you. ZACHARIAS. His doom Is but his choice made permanent on earth. [to Carloman] O fallen from blessedness of will, become The friend of heretics, the false of word To everlasting Truth, you are condemned Life-long to be a prisoner in your cell, Life-long to watch the scourge and crucifix. You chose them, as the God whom you abjure Chose them, forever; you have lapsed and they Become tormentors, till they force contrition At last and save you. CARLOMAN. [with a low, panting moan] Prison! ZACHARIAS. At Vienne, There till you die the prison you have made Of an eternal vow shall compass you. CARLOMAN. Think what it isâby God Himself, remember What you would do to me. The very dead Rise . . . Everything must have escape to live, And I shall still be living. [He throws both arms over his face, then suddenly removing them, makes a frenzied movement closer to the Pope.] Let me die Here, now! It is most impious, horrible To bury me, full to the lips with life. Sharpness-of-death, give that, but not to feel The prison walls close on an energy Beating its claim to worlds. ZACHARIAS. What I have spoken Is and remains irrevocable. BONIFACE. [gently to Carloman] Yield,â Yield to a God Who compasses you round With love so strong it binds you. CARLOMAN. And is hellâ But I reject such love. O Pepin, listen! I see so far! Your pact with Rome undoes Long centuries, and yields your country up To spiritless restriction, and a future Entombed alive, as mine will be, in night. Simply renounce your promise, bid your soldiers Seize the old man who numbs us. You and I Could set to music that would never end The forces of our people. PEPIN. You are crazy Or worse, and I disown you. [to Zacharias] On his head Let fall what curse you will. ZACHARIAS. Then he shall see The sacred pact between us re-confirmed. [to Monks] Fetch Chilperic! [Exeunt Monks.] And meanwhile bring fetters in To bind this renegade. [moving up to the royal board that crosses the hall at the further end] The treatyâsign! [Pepin and his nobles follow Zacharias: Attendants bring in fetters. Carloman submits mechanically to be bound, staring at Pepin, who affixes his signature to the treaty.] [Boniface goes round to Carloman.] BONIFACE. Son, you do well to take your shame so meekly, And bear in patience. CARLOMAN. [sharply] Have they bound me then? Look, Boniface! And Pepin is a slave. Nothing remains now in the world. That treaty, That pact! [Chilperic is taken before Zacharias and Pepin; they appear to address him, to consult with each other: then a monk advances and cuts off Chilperic's long hair, while he weeps bitterly. Geneviva and Marcomir re-enter hurriedly as if they had heard bad news and see Carloman bound.] GENEVIVA. Be true to him. MARCOMIR. I will. GENEVIVA. Then share His prisonâsay you left his monastery, Step forth and save him from his loneliness, My Marcomir, his friend. This is the moment; And, as you love him, speak. MARCOMIR. [drawing his cowl closer] No! Once before I went along with him: I went to hell. Renew that pain and foulness for his sake, Because I love himâ? GENEVIVA. Then because I love, If nothing else will urge youâfor my sake, Only for mine. MARCOMIR. And would you be a harlot Again, for him? GENEVIVA. Hush, never! MARCOMIR. No, we two Should understand each other, for we dare not Become what we have been. For my own sake I will not leave the world. GENEVIVA. He watches us . . . O agony! And he is turned away, And casts me off for ever. Go to himâ I cannot; for he sees me as I am, The glory dropt away. [Marcomir makes a forward movement] You shall not go! What do I say? I should not have the strength, Not all alone. Stay with me! It is plain What I must do to win him, and so hardâ It smiles so in the stream. Oh, hush! Look there! That is worse dying. How they pass before him, There, standing in his chains. And Pepin looks And hurries on, but all his gaze is fixed On Chilperic's shorn head. See, how they pass! Now Zachariasâ And he curses him: The earth is trembling. CARLOMAN. [making a movement as if to curse Zacharias] But I have no God To curse you with. I cannot do you harm. I have no God, no friend, no glowing hate: You all will pass before me in procession Day after day as shadows. ZACHARIAS. To his cell!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V Scene: The Prison at Vienne. [Carloman lying on a plank bed.] CARLOMAN. Though Time has played me falseâit is not that: It is the fading colours in my soul, And all the brilliant darkness through that chink; It isâ [The door opens and a Warder enters.] O Warder, put the food away; But come and chat with me. WARDER. I have instructions I must not speak a word. CARLOMAN. Is that the sentence? Sit down. WARDER. But I must see you drink this wine. The Pope, King Pepin tooâthey all are anxious Your life should be preserved. CARLOMAN. Sit down and drink. Now you will chat with me! WARDER. [drinking, and speaking always in an undertone] How do you feel? Here's to your health. CARLOMAN. Why, that is like a prayerâ Warmed by your voice. They who would shut men up, And bar them from their fellows' kindly voices, God cripple every motion of their soul! So I am here for ever. Take that bread: I like to see you eat. Now talk again. WARDER. But you will eat some too? CARLOMAN. No, my good jailer, You shall not forge that chain. You know I'm dying; Bring me my food and eat it here and talk, Then you will stay a little longer. Tell me, How is it with the sky to-day, the winds And the flowers crying after them? O God! [He buries his face in his hand.] WARDER. Sir, it's a south wind. CARLOMAN. Do the birds fly high? I watched them in great circles as I travelledâ WARDER. I have not noticed them. CARLOMAN. In wheeling flocks They mounted . . . Have you nothing more to say? It must be early morning in the world Where all is changing. WARDER. Ah, you'd know the time; Most prisoners get confused. CARLOMAN. No night nor day; God promised them foreverâmorn and eve, The gathering of the shadows, the decline, The darkness with no footfall: then the day And all things reappearing. That's for allâ Most for the prisoners, if you'd have them gentle. Throw down this shutter! WARDER. [shaking his head] That is just the pointâ In prison you get thwarted every way; You won't ask that to-morrow. [He rises, shakes the crumbs from his lap, sets the half-empty wine-bottle on a ledge within Carloman's reach and goes out.] CARLOMAN. Is he gone? [Carloman drags himself up and props himself by the wall with his ear against it.] I hear the river rushing past the walls, Rushing and rushing, and through all my dreams I labour to keep pace with it: awake, I give myself to rest. It comforts me, To hear the bounding current pass along, To think of the far travel of the drops, Crisping the tiny waves. Away, away! It is great peace to follow: to pursue Is misery. And if I kneel down here, I can just catch the glitter of the sun A-tumble down the stream. . . . [He crouches and looks through the chinks.] [Enter Zacharias and two Monks.] ZACHARIAS. Where is he? MONK. There, Peering between the loosened stones. CARLOMAN. [turning] The Pope! Leave me in peace. You promised me seclusion. I told you I would be alone with God. Leave me! ZACHARIAS. But you are shut up with the devil! Deep as you lie, you dare not make pretence That you have found your God. CARLOMAN. [laughing nervously] The seeker lost More than the thing to find. Leave me aloneâ You break the thread, you break it! O the stream, It flows and flows, and there are waterfalls Somewhere, great, heaving torrents . . . ZACHARIAS. [bending over him] To Vienne Pilate, they say, was banishedâhere to die. CARLOMAN. What, Pilate! ZACHARIAS. Do you tremble at the name? CARLOMAN. O God, he saw the light and knew it not, He had worse memories than Iscariot had Misusing his great office. He had power, Power to avert even Calvary . . . and yet We owe salvation to him. [lifting himself up from the ground] Can it be My blunder, my effacement shall prevail? [to Zacharias] So he was banished and came here to dieâ As you have banished me; it is enough; In chains and soon to die. There, hear them rattle; Now you have done your part. ZACHARIAS. Not till you yield, Not till I see you suffer. [aside] Are hell's rings Of fire prepared in vain for him?âRepent! CARLOMAN. Leave me! ZACHARIAS. No sinner has withstood me yet. You shall repent. CARLOMAN. But I am strong as you: I will not. ZACHARIAS. Oh, you must, for God's own sake, His MajestyâHe cannot strive and fail; His heart is set on you and He must have you, If but to bind in hell. Repent the past, Repent, repent! CARLOMAN. Not anythingâthe whole Strange journey and its perils that have brought me Here to the brink of Death: and all will come And touch that wonder, all will enter in, And rest and be revived. Why should one trouble? Death comes to all, you cannot banish him, And Death has all we seek for! ZACHARIAS. These are words For men the Church has blessed: but if you die Without the holy Sacraments, unshriven, And unabsolved, you will be flung away To yonder stream, shroudless and like a dog. Thus heretics are judged. CARLOMAN. [excitedly] Be borne along, Borne with the current. Is that possible? Borne deadâwell, each man takes his full desertâ Mine . . . is it possible? And further on Past towns and cities . . . then at last the sea. ZACHARIAS. Vain hope! You are God's prisoner. No escape, No waves to hide you and no help of man; For prayer itself like hope is quenched before The everlasting Prison-house. Farewell! [Exit with the Monks.] CARLOMAN. Ha! ha! He shuts the doorâso blank a sound! And now the river comes about my brain, And now the music foams incessantly, The music of my funeral. Enough For me that I shall lie against the heart Of that on-pouring volume . . . I am left By every creature I have breathed besideâ They do not want me. GodâHe least of all! He has a King to crown. All's well, all are provided for. . . . My brother Is in my place; my friend will take my wife. How Geneviva shuddered at my chains And clung to her old paramour! So easy The world's wounds are to heal. A little time, Ten years, a yearâand all is found defeat In any life, all turned to ridicule. [Enter Marcomir in lay dress.] MARCOMIR. I have great news for you. CARLOMAN. But I am dying! And now if all the doors were open wide I should not move to pass through any one. You cannot bring great news; I know it all, All that must come now: I can alter nothing. Rome will be succoured. MARCOMIR. Yes, the siege is raised, And Astolph in retreat. I am not come To talk of politics. CARLOMAN. Of private matters? My Astolph, Lombardy . . . MARCOMIR. To say farewell, To bless you. I am here as from the King; I showed the monks a parchment with the seal You used when you were ruler: it was found Among her jewels . . . CARLOMAN. Ah, I see, a gift. So you too play the King. My signet yours, Ay, and all else that ever bore my name. Keep it. MARCOMIR. But Carlomanâ CARLOMAN. I cannot wait To hear; I have so very little time To speak in and such hatred; hate that burns My heart through to the core. You, all of you, So glad that I am sunk here; Geneviva Moving no step to me; and that great Pope, I gave my soul to in a wondering love, Vexed that he cannot tame me, not desiring My help, my pardon. You must hear it allâ I am not in despair: I have a treasure, A burthen at my heartâwhere it belongs I do not know. I have tried many names, Tried God's . . . You see me dying, that may be; But not till I have cast my burthen down Can I be certain of my journey's end. How very still your face is! Are you dreaming, You look so happy? And that scarlet cloakâ Where is your habit? MARCOMIR. I have cast it off Forever; all my oaths are pushed aside, With all my penitence, by something holy, And the world seems new-born about me now; I live as in a kind of bliss,âsuch joy, Such fresh, warm sorrow. CARLOMAN. Genevivaâyes I know she loves you. Wait till I am dead. MARCOMIR. O Carloman, I dare not break my news, Not yet, you are not worthy. Do you hear How the Rhone sings outside? CARLOMAN. Beyond these shuttersâ The light, the lightning music! MARCOMIR. So life sweeps Down through my blood; at last I have its secret. CARLOMAN. Go, dash yourself into the Rhone and die! There is no secret hid in lifeâillusion, That is the great discovery. MARCOMIR. O listen! I am left poor and lonely in the world, So poor, so lonely, not a soul that needs, That ever can have need of me! Unloved And undesired, with just the sun to hail, The spring to welcome till I die, no more. And yetâ If they should thrust me in a prison-cell I should sing on in rapture. CARLOMAN. Undesired! She desires no one . . . but you dote on her, And that will set you singing. MARCOMIR. On my lips Already there is savour of rich song. That is the joy I spoke of. Oh, to spread The fame of my dead lady through the lands, To sing of Geneviva! CARLOMAN. She is dead? Come closer. Chafe my handsâ MARCOMIR. They mocked at her: âIf the Monk-King should ask now for his wife, And we presented him the prostitute, Would he not feel the ribaldry!â She stood Quite silent, and the ashen lines turned black On cheek and forehead; and they mocked her more: âThe harlot and the monk!â Then suddenly A young, wild, girlish glory crossed her face, She grasped me by the handâbut how we went Through the hot streets I know not. On the bridge She turned to meââTell Carloman his wife Is deadââand looking down, I saw her stretched Across the buoyant waters: from my sight Sucked under by the current 'neath the bridge, She did not rise. CARLOMAN. [triumphantly] And Marcomir, they promise To cast my body to the river there, And let it sweep along. MARCOMIR. But I shall sing Of life and youth, virginity and love. You leave me in the world; O Carloman, You leave me here delivered. CARLOMAN. We shall meet; And yet such life wells up in me I fear Lest I should not be dying. Geneviva! [turning to Marcomir] And you will sing to me? [He lies back, wrapt in ecstasy.] MARCOMIR. To you, to all. A tax is laid upon my very heart To sing the sweeping music of the Rhone, That rushes through my ears, that chants of her, Of all you have delivered. In its depths You will be buried, but the very burthen You die to utter, far away in France Will be caught up; Love will be free, and life Free to make change as childhood. Someone comesâ Hush, very softly, do not be afraid. [Boniface enters and steals up to Carloman.] BONIFACE. Belovedâ CARLOMAN. [putting his hand on the lips of Boniface] No more! Dear voice, end with that word: Beloved is not a prelude, it is all A dying man can bear. BONIFACE. [blessing him] All that I go To publish to the folk in heathen lands. Tho' very often it means martyrdom To listen to my story, I am blest Proclaiming it. CARLOMAN. [opening his eyes wide and raising himself] O Boniface, before I saw you as an angel. Is that wine Still on the stony ledge? [Marcomir brings the wine-bottle] Now let us drink, Drink all of us. [to Boniface] Go to your heathen lands With that great lay of love. This is a poet, And he too has a burthen, but more sadâ Men love so fitfully. I for myself Drink deep to life here in my prison-cell. I had a song . . . O Marcomir, the wordsâ Why do you stumble? Once again the cup! Fellowship, pleasure These are the treasureâ So I believe, so in the name of Time . . . [He sinks back and dies.]</field>
