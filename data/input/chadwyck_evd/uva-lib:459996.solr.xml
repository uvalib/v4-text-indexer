      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDY OF MEDÃA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, spoken by Mr. WILKS. From Age to Age, MedÃ¦a's Wrongs have been The moving Business of the tragick Scene. Athens and Rome, both listned to her Cares, And the lov'd Matron's Cause approv'd in Tears. To British Eyes she weeps, in British Strains To Night, this haughty, injur'd Wife complains. If she too delicately feels her Woe Or deals swift Vengeance on her hated Foe, Consider,â'twas two thousand Years ago. Those good old Folks distinguish'd Right from Wrong, And when the Heart dissented from the Tongue, They call'd it Fraud;âev'n violated Faith Was punish'd in those barbarous Climes with Death. The Rites of sacred Love by Love were made, And Marriage was not then become a Trade. No midnight Masquerades, no Hackney Coaches, Assemblys, Gaming, Tea-table debauches Seduc'd the faithful Husband or the Wife, Each led an honest, careful, virtuous Life; They rais'd their Children for the publick Weal, In Arms and Arts they taught them to to excel; And he was thought most wealthy and most wise, In those odd Days, who farthest was from Vice. If then this old and learned Tale succeeds, If the good Heart for suffering Virtue bleeds, If your Breasts heave with Sorrows not your own, While you attend Creusa's plaintive Moan, Check not with conscious Shame the pious Tear, 'Tis consecrated to the Brave and Fair; The Drops, which thus for injur'd Virtue flow, Must fall from virtuous Eyes, and Hearts that know The pleasing Pains of sympathetick Woe. Such soft descending Rain, such social Dews Support and dignify the tragick Muse.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Apartment of MedÃ¦a in the Palace of Creon. ÃgÃ¦us, Ethra. ÃgÃ¦us. Ethra, thou know'st my Soul, thou know'st the Fires, That slowly waste, and prey upon my Vitals; Time, Absence, Reason, and th'uncommon Warmth, With which MedÃ¦a doats on perjur'd Jason, Ought to convince me she can ne'er be mine; Yet still my thoughtless Passion hurries on; From Realm to Realm, and Sea to Sea, I drag The Chain of Hope; and wait upon her Fortunes. ETHRA. O Prince! with what a wild and distant View Thy generous Soul pursues the fairy Prospect. You see her Wrongs from Jason but inflame And manifest her Passion in Extremes. Not the most smiling Hour can make her thine. Thy Love, ÃgÃ¦us, may produce Esteem; Esteem a cold Return; yet all that she Can grant, or you expect. ÃGÃUS. Yet still my Heart Delights in Hope; and, reasonless and lost, To every other Comfort, feeds on Air; And while I thus attend her Hours of Sorrow, I very vainly fancy that I merit, Because I wish to merit from MedÃ¦a. Yes, Ethra, yes, thou knowst my Soul sincere (E're this her Favourite Jason sail'd for Cholchis) Was all MedÃ¦a's, was thy Sister's wholly. Curs'd be the Day, when first this Ship, this Argo, Cut thro' the liquid Plain her Way to Cholchis. Accurs'd be Pelion, whose aspiring Brow First nourish'd the tall Pine that bound her Wings. O that the generous Band of noble Youth, Who sail'd within her under Jason's Conduct, Had ne're return'd loaden with fleecy Gold To Pelea's Shores; MedÃ¦a then unknowing Of Love, or Guilt, of Jealousy or Jason, Had rul'd perhaps in Peace Minerva's City, My happy Consort.âEthra, these are Visions, Elizian Dreamsâan Interval of Hope That points Despair and quickens every Pain. ETHRA. You know, ÃgÃ¦us, wise and equal Creon, Who rules this happy Land, the King of Corinth, Adopted Jason as the worthiest Heir, And gave his only Daughter to his Arms. He chose him to secure, by this Allyance, As far as human Foresight can secure, A Race of future Princes wise and valiant. ÃGÃUS. This Usage may estrange MedÃ¦a's Heart. ETHRA. Yes, there is still this Hope; Creon resolves, As Fame reports, to banish her from Corinth; MedÃ¦a and her Children. Athens then May prove a happy Refuge for that Princess, A blest Assylum; and ÃgÃ¦us then May claim a Debt, a Debt of Gratitude. ÃGÃUS. O thou hast fir'd my Soul; a pleasing Warmth Runs thro' my Veins. And is it possible? This Hour, they say, the Nuptials were perform'd, And Jason's and Creusa's Hands were join'd. ETHRA. 'Tis true the Chariots are but now return'd From Hymen's Temple. I observ'd the Croud; The catching Joy ran thro' the giddy Populace; Pleas'd and displeas'd they know not why; they shouted; They hugg'd the gilded Spokes, and bore aloft The Chariot Wheels. All Eyes were fix'd on Jason And the fair Bride. They gaz'd and gap'd and swallow'd With Joy the Showâthe neighing Prancer's paw'd; They rais'd their Crests, and beat the sparkling Pavement; They shook their Mains, proud of their gilded Trappings; With Veins inflam'd, and Nostrils breathing Fire They likewise seem'd to share the general Triumph. ÃGÃUS. And did MedÃ¦a see this Sacrifice? ETHRA. She saw her Jason, crown'd with nuptial Garlands, Lead his new Wife Creusa to the Temple; She saw them mount the golden Throne together; She saw the Priests perform the nuptial Sacrifice. ÃGÃUS. How did MedÃ¦a bear this stabbing Sight? ETHRA. As Seas opposing Winds; as the torn Earth Convulsive fires, At first she strove to check Her swelling Heart; she feign'd to seem unmov'd And smiled contemptuously; but yet her Smiles Were mark'd with Horror.âWhen a sudden Shivering Seiz'd every Limb, and a dead Paleness spread Her beauteous Face, she sunk into my Arms A Weight of Death. Her Servants bore her hither Intranc'd, and by her Sorrows overwhelm'd. As she revives, her Pains revive again, Again she feels, she rages, she complains. ÃGÃUS. Her Sufferings touch my sympathizing Soul. ETHRA. Now she beholds MedÃ¦a lost, neglected, Her Beauties scorn'd. What Woman tamely bears Contempt and slighted Love? She upbraids her Lord, Her perjur'd Lord; she calls upon the Gods And injur'd Justice, deprecates the Vengeance Of Heav'n and Earth;âthen desolate and mourning Refuses Food and Sleep, while Drop by Drop The Sorrows down her fading Features fall, Nor lifts her Eyes to Heav'n, nor listens she To Friends Advice, or wishes for her Health, Deaf as the Rocks or Waves; then raves again, Raises her bloodshot Eyes, with Sorrow swoln; Deplores her Country lost, her Father's House Abandon'd all for an ungrateful Husband. ÃGÃUS. Ungrateful! yes a vile unworthy Traitor. ETHRA. But when she sees the Children of this Husband, The dearest Pledges, once, of mutual Love, Redoubled Wrath tortures her aking Heart, Her Soul impetuous, violent and rash, Hardly supports her Wrongs; she suffers them Indignant and enflam'd; I see the swellings Of her tempestuous Mind, and every Hour Expect to see the pointed Dagger plung'd Deep in her Heart, stung with Despair and Jealousy. ÃGÃUS. Ye Gods! Propitious all to injur'd Virtue, Ease her torn Mind; and mitigate her Pains. ETHRA. Jason perhaps, tho' her Soul doats to Death On this ungrateful Man, may feel her Rage; Or, when her Eye beholds the nuptial Bed Of her false Lord, will she restrain her Hand From Violence and Blood;âwith Vehemence She loves and hates. [Flourish of Trumpets. ÃGÃUS. Attend, these Chariots speak the King's Approach. The solemn, great Procession now has reach'd The Palace Gates. Ethra, let us retire; Endeavour with thy Council to support Thy much wrong'd Sister, desolate MedÃ¦a. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Palace of CREON. CREON, JASON, CREUSA, with Attendants, From the Temple of Hymen. Hymen in a flame-coloured Vest, with a Chaplet of Roses, a large waxen Taper in his right Hand, a golden Heart in his left Hand, and a Cornucopia by his Side. He is attended by six Priests of Hymen, with Olive Branches in their right Hands, and crown'd with Laurel and waxen Tapers in their left Hands; several Officers of the Palace in flame-coloured Robes. Jason and Creusa both crowned with the Greek Diadem, intermixed with Flowers. The King alone on the Throne, Jason and Creusa are seated on his right and left Hand, solemn Musick by the whole OrchÃ¦stra; the HymenÃ¦al Dance. Creon descends. CREON, JASON, CREUSA. CREON. Jason, thy Virtue shall deliver down To late Posterity the Name of Creon. JASON. When you bestow, like Heav'n, beyond the Hope Or Power of meriting, what can we pay But the poor Sacrifice of Thanks? I feel My Heart now swelling into Words to utter What you with Pain would hear. My Benefactor, My Royal Master, let me add, my Father, By every Title dost thou hold my Heart; I am thy Child, thy Servant, and thy Friend. CREON. Bending with Age, and looking to my Grave, My Spirits rekindle at this wish'd Alliance; They start again into a Blaze of Youth. Here I take Root once more, I spring in thee; I see arising from this wish'd Alliance A Line of Heroes, valiant, wise and just, The future Benefactors of Mankind. I see them sink deep in the Lengths of Time, And spreading wide. Ages unborn shall bless This Union. All the Temples of our Gods Shall yearly sound repeated IÃ´ PÃ¦ans, From Age to Age, as this great Day returns. JASON. Oh sweeter than the spicy Breath of Morning, Best Gift of Heav'n and Creon, my Creusa; Why are those Lights, whose Beams vyed with the Day, Cast in a Shade? Why drops this pearly Dew? Now, blushing like Aurora, the warm Blood Crimsons thy Cheek, now pale as Cynthia's Rays. Hence with these maiden Fears. Jason is thine; If that be pleasing to thee; wholly thine. CREUSA. That you are mine, it covers me with Shame When I confess so much, and fills my Soul With Joy, with Transport not to be related. Oh that you were, that you were wholly mine! [Aside. CREON. Thy Sex, Creusa, is by Nature weak, Made up of Tenderness and soft Compassion, Unapt to combat with the Cares of Life. The Gods have form'd you in the Arts of Peace, To sweeten and reward the Hero's Toils. The Warrior is the fair One's strong Defence, Her Bulwark 'gainst Adversity and Violence. What better Guardian of my Realms and thee Cou'd I provide than Jason, fam'd and honour'd, The Pride of wond'ring Greece, inur'd to Dangers, Taught in Adversity's hard School to bend, To break his Passions and subdue himself? CREUSA. (If there are Creatures of superior Excellence, Who cover with their Wings the weak and innocent) Thou art my guardian God. Yes, I look up With Honour towards my glorious, great Protector. Rever'd and lov'd, thus let me pay my Thanks, [kneeling. Yet let my Soul open her Fears before thee. [rising. MedÃ¦a, Sir,âshe claims a Right above me; She threatens, rages, jealous and revengeful. A jealous Woman's Hate is to be feared. MedÃ¦a too is skill'd in dreadful Knowledge, In Nature's Secrets learn'd; the magian Arts Are all her own; she draws from Drugs and Simples Distracting Poisons and inchanting Powers. These Fears, forgive me, do a little cloud The Joys of this bright Day. CREON. Creusa, fear not, I have provided well. Retire, my Child; The ceremonious Labours of the Day Demand repose. Forms of thy tender Make Are hurt and weary'd with the least Disorder. [Jason leads Creusa to the Door and returns. [Exeunt Creusa and Attendants. [Remain only Creon and Jason. SCENE III. CREON. Jason, thou know'st our Council have advis'd To drive this Woman into Banishment, This most unhappy Source of all thy Sufferings, Cruel MedÃ¦a; Wisdom, Justice, Reason, The publick Safety, all demand her Exile. JASON. My Soul, yet conscious of the Wrongs I suffer, Forgives MedÃ¦a, as her Guilt was caus'd By Love, by her unhappy Love for Jason. I know her haughty and ungovern'd Spirit Will ne'er forgive me; yet my Soul relenting Begs you wou'd suffer her to end her Days, They cannot now be long, in your Protection. CREON. I would not probe too deep thy wounded Mind, Nor set again before thee, what thy Soul With Horror saw, the Misery and Bloodshed, With which this lawless Woman has dishonour'd Thee and thy House; yet let us well provide Against those Evils she yet meditates, And then for ever lose her in Oblivion; For Policy requires that publick Mischiefs Should rather be prevented than deplor'd. Let me speak plain; these Children of MedÃ¦a (Whose guiltless Innocence now move our Pity) With envious and ambitious Eyes may see The House of Creon. Seeds of civil Discord May flame in future Times and interrupt The publick Peace. JASON. Yet what can she attempt! Friendless and weak, and subject to thy Power, Let her imbitter'd Jealousy have Scope, Give Freedom to her Rage and her Invectives. The Nations have already thrown her out For Crimes too black to mention; all but Athens. There good ÃgÃ¦us, govern'd by his Passion, Leaves one Assylum open to her Crimes. Wou'd it not look like Fear, mingled with Malice, To cast her out thus destitute and weak, Unable to assault us but with Weapons To be depis'd; her Malice and her Tongue. CREON. You plead her Cause with much Humanity; There's some Impression of your antient Flame Left on your Heart. Nor do I blame thee, Jason; A generous Warmth opens the Hero's Soul, And soft Compassion flows where Courage dwells. Yet let us wisely learn t'oppose our Passions And check the softer Dictates of our Nature, Where both the publick and the private Weal Demand the Magistrate to guard the State. JASON. How is the Magistrate concern'd to guard Against a weak, defenseless Woman's Threats? CREON. True; were she number'd with the common Mass Of Females, who complain of broken Vows And wedlock Bonds dissolv'd, her Threats might pass As Trifles of no Consequence or Danger. MedÃ¦a's Soul is form'd above the Vulgar. The World with Wonder and with Horror view Her Learning and Command of Nature's Powers; Her Arts are known thro' all the Realms of Greece; Her Magick fear'd; Ruin attends her Threats, And Desolation waits on her Commands; A daring Hand, a knowing Mind, a Heart Burning and prompt to execute her Will, By jealous Furies haunted. Wild MedÃ¦a Gives us no Room to think her Menaces Deserve to be contemn'dâNo, let her go To Exile; let her Children too attend her. JASON. Oh! Sir, my Children. CREON. âYes, I said her Children. I know how tenderly this touches thee; Not to have treated with thee, on this Subject, Might have been less indecent, not so generous; Yet will I not oblige thy Tongue to utter A forc'd Consent, lest Reason, urg'd too home, Shou'd look like Violence. JASON. O Prince, thy Justice Thus temper'd with Humanity and Sweetness Forces the Criminal to bless the Mouth, From whence the Words that sentence him proceed. CREON. Jason, this done, MedÃ¦a thus remov'd, And those who may in future Times create The Seeds of civil Discord, I retire, A satisfy'd and well-pleas'd Guest, from Life. If I have ruled, by Laws the Gods have given, A willing People, and not made my Power The Rule of Right and Wrong; if yet my Soul Endeavours to deliver down this Trust To Hands for Valour and for Justice fam'd, Farther to bless the People thus committed To my peculiar Care; Oh! may my Memory Smell sweet when I am Dust, and good Men say, He was an upright and a just Protector; Such as the Rulers of the Earth shou'd be. JASON. O Prince, thy Soul is sway'd by equal Justice; Thy People from their Benefits alone Perceive thou art their King; glorious and good; Known by superior Excellence a Prince, The first among Mankind, as first in Virtue. May the just Powers lengthen thy Days a little; A little longer yet continue to us The Bounty of thy Reign. A righteous King Is like the God of Day, a general Parent. CREON. Too much of this;âMen, who delight in Virtue, Feel in themselves the great Reward they seek; We want not, but our Nature is so weak We covet Praise. Jason, this very Hour I will my self in Person see MedÃ¦a; 'Twou'd be indecent Treatment by a Herald To send her Sentence; to her Dignity, Her Rank and Character, we owe Respect. I will endeavour by my Words to soften The hard Necessity that drives her hence. She shall at least be satisfy'd, my Jason, There is no Malice mingled with the Punishment. JASON. Her Punishment! whatever she may merit, My Soul is wounded when I think she suffers; I see my self divided from my self, And one half torn away. The Children, Creon! I see the rising Billows swell; the Wreck Dwells on my Eyes and beats my troubled Mind. Thus human Joys are leaven'd with Misfortunes; The Storm succeeds the Sun-shine. Now soft Etesian Gales and smiling Rays Flatter our wanton Hopes with happy Days; While yet we hope, the Shepherd views afar Black gathering Waters load the bending Air; The dreadful Column bursts, breaks o'er the Plain, Lays waste the Land, and swells the foamy Main. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. MedÃ¦a, Ethra. MedÃ¦a. Ill shall we judge, if from the Mouth of Fame We mark the Characters of Vice, and Virtue. Here Pageants rise, made by Tradition Heroes, Form'd by the Poet, or the loose Historian; There you behold imaginary Gods Rais'd by the venal Breath of Slaves to Heaven, Swoln with the Praise of Fools, ignobly great, By Lust, Ambition, Tyranny or Rapine; While the good Prince, whose soft indulgent Nature Delights in Peace, and blesses all with Plenty Who smile beneath him, is revil'd and censur'd, As an inactive, useless, idle Drone. The wayward Eye of Man sees all Things wrong. ETHRA. You too severely judge. Virtue and Vice Have their Rewards; and all the good and wise, Do with impartial Votes, applaud and censure. MEDÃA. I try to reason, Ethra, to compare; But if my sorrow-beaten Mind, impair'd Perhaps by my Misfortunes, measures wrong, Impute it to a Wretch, weary of Day-light, Whose wild, disorder'd Thoughts no more are sway'd By Reason's Guidance.âJason then is wedded, To fair Creusa wedded.âHappy she! What do the World conceive? How do they judge? Do they not censure Him, and pity Me? ETHRA. He is, and by the World is judg'd to be The worst and most perfidious of his Sex. MEDÃA. Oh wretched Woman! Oh defenceless Sex! Of the whole animated Race most helpless. We purchase Slavery with Wealth and Honours; And when we take a Husband, buy a Tyrant; A stern, domestick Foe, morose, unjust; Bound by no Law himself; and yet demanding A strict Obedience from the frail and weak. ETHRA. Too oft, by Parents joyn'd, unknowing, innocent, Artless and young the tender Virgin takes A Master, not a Lover to her Arms; The momentary Transports soon decay; A dull and sullen Servitude succeeds; For Life succeeds. Honour forbids Divorce, And every Creature hopes for Liberty, But the poor Captive of the Marriage Bed. MEDÃA. Ye Gods! why were we form'd with Souls of Fire; Ãtherial Minds! Why did you trust your Work, Your Master-work, even Man, to us to form; To us to nourish if you meant us Slaves? Yet, Ethra, what is This to thee? Thy Wisdom Has sav'd thee from the Chain; and virgin Honours Shall bloom round thy chaste Urn, when thou art Ashes. Yes, happy Maid; thou must return to Cholchis, Thy native City, and thy Father's House; While I, thrown out a Vagabond on Earth, Deserted, helpless, injur'd, innocent, Behold no Mother, Brother, Kinsman, Friend. No Port is open. All a barren wild And waste of MiseryâHah! tell me, Ethra? Am I to suffer unreveng'd? My Heart Swells with Resentment.âIs there then no Way, No Means to punish this adulterous Man? Nor him, who durst, (Dishonour on his Name!) In Violation of all civil Rites, Bestow Creusa on my wedded Husband. Why art thou silent? Is a Woman's Vengeance, An injur'd, jealous Woman, to be slighted? Weak in the Field, unable to contend With warring Hosts, we sink, appal'd, unnerv'd; But when we feel the Pangs of Love contemn'd, Let the Wrong-doer stand aghast and know, Not the red Fire from Jove's unerring Arm Strikes surer than a jealous Woman's Rage. THERAPION. The King of Corinth asks Admittance, Creon; Demands immediate Audience of MedÃ¦a. The Features of the good old King, inflam'd With Anger and Concern, declare his Business Is of Importanceâ MEDÃA. âWellâ'tis well, Therapion; I'll see the good old King;âmy Servants too Are lost, corrupted allâNow, Ethra, now, MedÃ¦a is no more.âBehold the King. Enter Creon. CREON , MEDÃA, ETHRA. MedÃ¦a, to thy Fortune and thy Birth I owe this last, this decent Visitation, And am the Herald of my own Decree. Stern is thy Mind, inflexible and hard, Not yielding to thy Lot; therefore, MedÃ¦a, Thou must no longer breathe in happy Corinth; And Exile is thy Doom; thou and thy Children Must go to Banishment;âthe Chariots wait; The Horsemen stand prepar'd to give you Conduct To the extreamest Limits of our Land. MEDÃA. Ills follow one another, and my Foes Are most industrious, diligent in Ruin; And yet however I am treated, Creon, Instruct me, how have I deserv'd my Sentence? What Wrongs have I committed? Whom offended? If to have suffer'd Wrongs be deem'd a Crime, I am the most offending Wretch alive. CREON. I'll give thee then the Reasons of thy Exile, And in few Words. MedÃ¦a, Thee I fear; Fear for Creusa; for the Life of Jason; Nor is th'Occasion of my Fear ill grounded. A subtile, learned, artful, angry Woman Bemoans her widow'd Bed, and breathes Revenge. Loudly she threatens, and denounces Vengeance On me, my Daughter, and her once lov'd Husband; Nor is her Power inferior to her Passion; She looks all Nature thro' with piercing Eyes, Discerns her Principles, and Laws and Powers, And (like a God) acts with superior Knowledge O'er the unlearned Crowd. This, This is she, Whom I confess I fear. I banish thee For my own Safety, and 'tis better much I should incur thy Hatred than thy Vengeance. MEDÃA. Alas! Alas! how hard is evil Fame? And how unjustly does she load the innocent? Is Knowledge criminal? Is Wisdom Guilt? Perish all Learning then. Ye tender Parents, Avoid with Care to cultivate your Children. Let the wild Mind grow waste. The learned all Beset by Ignorance or Envy live Despis'd or hated; while the vulgar laugh At what they know not; Educated Pedants Burn with the Hatred of superior Merit. Must I too, a weak Woman, undeserving, Share the hard Fortune of the envy'd wise; CREON. Knowledge, in virtuous Minds, is as a Light Set up on high, the Guide of wand'ring Error; But, when by Passion govern'd, is a Meteor Much to be dreaded.â MEDÃA. Pacify thy Fears; My Husband is the Object of my Hatred; Not Creon. Creon has not wrong'd MedÃ¦a. You have bestow'd your Daughter, where your Mind, Benevolent to her, and to your People, Counsel'd you well. Yes, Jason is a Heroe, Belov'd, or fear'd by all; from me alone Deserving Hate; and wisely have you done; Nor do I see the Glories of your House With envious EyesâEnjoy your Blessings long. This only Good I ask; worn out with Sorrows, Permit me, thus with suppliant Hands I beg, Oh suffer me within your Realms, though injur'd, To waste in peaceful Quiet the Remains, This Ebb of a low miserable Life, And learn Humility to my Superiors. CREON. Thy Words, tho' softer than the Dew that nurses The blooming Infants of the Spring, avail not; Inchanting is thy Speech and might have Power To shake a Mind less exercis'd and constant; But the more zealously thou pray'st, my Trust Grows less; I know thy Soul is charg'd with Fires, And when I see thee thus conceal with Art, And govern thy wild Mind, I fear thee much. Those Hearts, that start at once into a Blaze And open all their Rage, like Summer Storms At once discharg'd, grow cool again and calm. Therefore you must prepare for Banishment; This Instant must you go; so 'tis decreed. MEDÃA. Oh Creon, bending to thy royal Knee In fair Creusa's Name, the Virgin Bride, Let me intreat the Mercy of the King. CREON. It must not be,âThe Guards, the Chariots wait; Learn to submit, where you cannot oppose; They will conduct you, with Respect and Care, To the extreamest Limit of our Land. MEDÃA. I do not ask thee to repeal my Banishment I would intreat the Kingâ CREON. Speak; I attend, MedÃ¦a. MEDÃA. I am a Mother, Creon; two small Orphans, (Such I may call them now) their Parents lost, The Sons of Jason once, they too must share Their Mothers Destiny, guilty and punish'd, Unable and unknowing to offend; 'Tis not decreed that They should suffer Want; And since their Father means not to provide, Indulge a Mother's Fondness; suffer me But one Day more to breathe Corinthian Air, One only Day, it is not much, to furnish The necessary Means for their Support. You are a Father, Creon, and you know The Yearnings of a Father to his Children. When I behold my Children suffer, Creon, Wand'ring in unknown Lands, forlorn and innocent, And punish'd for my Sake, my Heart drops Blood. CREON. Thou hast obtain'd thy Prayer. I do consent Thou shalt remain within our Realm one Day, One only Day. Provide for thee and thine; I err in this Indulgence; but remember, If when To-morrow's Sun has left the Horizon Thou shalt be found in Corinth, thou shalt die; Thou and thy Children; 'tis the King's Decree, Nor shall the greatest Power on Earth reverse it. MedÃ¦a, may the mighty Gods of Greece Protect and help thee. [Exit Creon. ETHRA. Indignant Joy Crimsons your Cheek; your Features rise in Raptures Mix'd with Despair; your Eyes dart baleful Fires. What fills your Mind? What is it you revolve? MEDÃA. My Soul exults, dilated; the big Hope Of Vengeance is in View.âOne only Day! Between the rising, and the setting Sun, Three of my Foes must die; the guilty Husband, The Father, and the Bride. How shall I end them? Ten thousand Ways croud on my raptur'd Brain, And each demands Precedence. Oh! my Heart Bounds lightly, and springs forward to the Work, Disburthen'd of her Anguish;âGodlike Vengeance! ETHRA. The boiling Passions torture your swoln Heart And rack it with imaginary Joy; The burning Nerves of your sick Brain conceive Delusive Pleasures. MEDÃA. Tell me, tell me, Ethra, Shall I collect into one Point the Beams Of my immortal Sire, and strike at once This House of Creon, and dislolve togther And mingle in one Mass the adulterate Race. Or shall I rush upon their secret Transports; In dead of Night break on their curs'd Indearments And stab these Lovers in each others Arms. No, this may not succeed; and if I fail They may deride my disappointed Rage! What hinders thee, MedÃ¦a, thou art skill'd In all the various Poisons of the Earth! Be it so thenâby Poison let them perish. ETHRA. Retire, and think of Rest; think of your Children. Let us consult how best we may provide For thee and thine in Exile. Waste not now The precious Moments with the flattering Hopes Of Vengeance. Think what Land, what Country; where Wou't thou direct thy Steps? MEDÃA. Oh where indeed? What hospitable Hand will now relieve Me and my Children?âEthra, there is none; No Hand will now relieve me; therefore here, Here let us stay, and Act by Policy What Force denies. ETHRA. What Policy, what Art Can a weak Woman, unbefriended, single, Contrive against a wise and powerful Prince? MEDÃA. However, Ethra I will not fall alone. This Bride and Bridegroom! Their nuptial Sweets I'll dash with Gall and Bitterness. Then, when they Feast; then, when the Blood boils high! Blooming with Joys to come, when the soft Flute Nurses the genial Wishâthenâthen MedÃ¦a Darts her avenging Bolt.âTheir odious Joys Have broke my Strings of Life; nor shall MedÃ¦a Fall unaveng'd. My Exile, their Alliance, Commence in Blood. Haste then, MedÃ¦a; haste; Use all thy Arts; deliberate; contrive; Dare all Things; stimulate thy Godlike Mind, And suffer not this House of Sysiphus To mock thy Wrongs; sprung from the Source of Day, The Sun thy Sire, Inheritrix of Light And godlike Knowledge; rise on thy own Virtues. Exit MedÃ¦a. ETHRA alone. Alas! her wounded Mind warmly enjoys A pleasing Vengeance, which the Gods deny; A short, a painful, and delusive Pleasure. Man is by Nature false and vows of Love And Gratitude and Truth, like the warm Breath That utters them, at once are heard and lost. Exit Ethra. SCENE II. The Palace of Creon. JASON, CREUSA. JASON. The Day salutes thee, fairest of thy Sex And best belov'd; the chearful Day salutes thee. Creusa rises like the Morn in Blushes, Diffusing Joy and Warmth o'er every Heart. Oh may this Day, the whitest in the Circle Of rolling Time, be mark'd for ever happy! And may the bounteous Gods, who thus ingraft The House of Pelias and our Father Neptune On Creon's Stock, inrich with every Virtue, And form my Mind, aspiring still to merit What I possess. CREUSA. Oh! Jason! may the Gods, If they have will'd it so, erase the Memory Of poor MedÃ¦a's Wrongs; or calm her Mind And let her feel no more, what now she feels. Alas! were I to lose, what I possess By a less Title, Jason's Faith, and Love, How wou'd my Soul endure it?âWhen we pity, We pity thus ourselves, and Mercy lives In every Heart, that merits to receive it. JASON. Oh! think no more of that unhappy Woman, Creusa. Little do we know of Fate; Perhaps our Fortune is not in our Power. We are the Sport and Play-things of high Heaven, And while this second Cause presumes to act, Think, and reflect, is acted by the First; As the great Mover sets us so we go. But thou wert form'd by Heav'n when all Things smil'd, And Nature joy'd to hear the aspicious Gods, As they had wrought this Work, pronounce it happy. Enjoy the present, look into the length Of Days to come, and bless the beauteous Prospect. Thy Doubts, thy Fears, my tender Bride, accuse The righteous Gods, who with a lavish Hand Endow'd thy finish'd Form, and heavenly Mind. CREUSA. It is the Mark of a dishonest Mind Not to commiserate ev'n the most guilty. He, who unmov'd beholds the Wretch's Pains, Is such a Wretch, as may deserve our Pity. Forgive me, Jason, my reflecting Soul Will feel the Sufferings of poor MedÃ¦a. This Day she goes into eternal Exile; The Guards, the Chariots stand prepar'd; my Father With his own Mouth pronounces the Decree; The hard Decree; still must I think it so; For tho' her Crimes were many, all the Guilt was caus'd by Love; 'twou'd be unjust in me, Who know not what I cou'd not do or suffer For Jason's sake, not to forgive MedÃ¦a. JASON. Oh! thou all Goodness! How thy beauteous Mind Beams forth in every Word! Thy great Example Enlightens, warms, and animates to Virtue. Enter Messenger. MESSENGER. Jason, the King of Corinth is return'd; The Guards, appointed to attend MedÃ¦a, Return with him; a Smile sits on his Cheek, As he were pleas'd with some Benevolence Done to his Fellow Creature. He advances To this Apartment. JASON. hah! Return'd! Has he then alter'd the severe Decree? CREUSA. Yes, he has pardon'd her; I know his Mind Enjoys the sacred Pleasure. Creon's Soul, When he forgives alone, is truely happy. CREON Enters. My Children, I have added to the Morn, That crowns my Bliss, the Pleasure of a Bounty To the most wretched; and my Soul rejoices. JASON. Well have you doneâthe Rulers of the World Unmercifully just, who punish all To the severest Rigour of the Laws, Are most unjust themselves, and violate The Laws they seem to guard. There is a Justice Due to Humanity. MedÃ¦a lives; In Corinth lives; thou hast thyself revers'd Thy own Decree. CREON. Not so my Son; MedÃ¦a May live, but not in Corinth. To her Prayers, Moving and just, one only Day is granted, To guard against the Wants of Banishment, And to support those little faultless Exiles, Who suffer for their Mothers Crimesâ MEDÃA. Alas! Must They too wander; must They taste the Woes; And Wants of Banishment; severe Decree! How will their tender Feet support the Travel, And beat the burning Desert!âSoften, Creon, Part of thy Sentence; suffer yet the Children To breathe in Corinth; let them undisturb'd Enjoy the Indulgence of a Father's Love; Their plaintive Innocence demands thy Mercy, Their Wants thy Charity, their Youth support. JASON. Creon, attend this beauteous Oratrix; She pleads in Virtue's Cause; let every Word Sink deep into thy Heart and rise in Mercy. Oh! Did thy Soul but feelâ CREON. Jason, no more! My sympathising Soul now feels thy Pangs, Yet must we not indulge our Nature's Weakness So far to oppose the great unerring Laws Of Policy and Wisdom. 'Tis the Office, 'Tis the first Duty of the Magistrate To guard the People's Welfare, and secure, As far as human Wisdom can secure, Their future Peace.âOur Council have advis'd; The Law is sworn and publish'd. Urge no more, Lest my fond Heart turn Rebel to my Reason And I offend against the publick Good. Let not one Act of Passion blot my Reign. JASON, Thy Wisdom strikes me with resistless Force, Makes Sorrow mute; yet Oh! Permit me, Creon, To visit my sad Family and take One parting Kiss; let me provide the Means For their Support, and guard against those Evils, That Want and a laborious Exile threaten. CREON. 'Tis well; perform thy Duty to thy Children. I am a Father too, and well, I hope, My People know and feel I am their Father. A worthy Prince must be the common Parent, And, like the Powers above generous and good, Shower down his godlike Virtues on Mankind; Whilst the vain Tyrant, in a cringing Herd Of dissolute and servile Courtiers, blazes; Pride, Luxury, Profusion and Expence Surround the giddy Thing; drunk with the Breath Of Parasites and SlavesâO Jason, Jason, When shortly, as they must, the Reins of Government Fall to thy Hand, avoid the smooth tongu'd Villain; He is the Bane of every royal Virtue. JASON. My Heart attends, and I wou'd emulate Thy Virtues, tho' they soar so far above me. But, Creon, now my Soulâ CREON. Controul thy Passions, Thou hast awaken'd Dangers, and been arm'd By strong Adversity to combat Perils; The Hero works thro' Storms his Way to Glory. Virtue like purest Gold is prov'd in Fire. The sinewy Cyclops his rough Metal steel'd, And Arms on adamantine Anvils neal'd; With Heat and Strength harden'd the massy Bar, And cloath'd th'immortal Leader of the War; Arm'd with impenetrable Mail, the God Triumphant o'er gygantick Squadrons rode. Our Passions are the Legions we shou'd quell, And solid Virtue is the temper'd Steel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. JASON, MEDÃA. JASON. Rage is a sharp, unmanageable Evil, Preys on itself, is a devoted Foe To Truth and Virtue; yet without a Rein You give a Loose to every Gust of Passion. You might have breath'd here, in a fruitful Soil, With Decency and Honour; but your Words Vain and Invective banish you for ever. MEDÃA. Behold the steddy, smooth tongu'd Orator, Who knows to varnish Crimes and colour Guilt. JASON. For me, accustom'd to indure your Wrath, Inur'd to your Reproaches, when you say How bad a Man this Jason is, it hurts not; But when sharp Words attack your Benefactors, When they with Bitterness and taunting Stings Strike your Superiors; then, MedÃ¦a, Banishment May be accounted Mercy; I have long From angry and unreasonable Men Learnt to restrain my Tongue and found it useful; This Jason yet, your last and only Friend, Unweary'd in your Service, still is yours; I come to offer you a Guard, and Guides, That you and those unhappy little Ones, Who suffer for your sake, may not be destitute. Exile has many Wants. Altho' you hate me Yet my Benevolence, my warm Affection, And Wishes will attend you thro' the World. MEDÃA. âWith a sedate and unrelenting Brow Calmly to look upon the wrong'd, and cover Thy Crimes with Temper, is the certain Mark Of an abandon'd Mind, cool even in Guilt. âYet art thou Welcome; now my swelling Beast Shall ease its Weight and, if thy Heart can feel, Bleed with my Words. JASON. MedÃ¦a, I'll attend Thy just Complaints; but Words in Wrath are useless. MEDÃA. First then I sav'd thy Life; the golden Fleece Redeem'd from Cholchis by my Care and Art; By me, by my Assistance did you conquer The Monster breathing Fire, the scaly Dragon Wreathing in endless Folds his dreadful Form, A breathing Pestilence; I lent the Clue, That guided thee in Safety thro' the Labarinth; Betray'd my royal Father, fled with thee, And sav'd thee by my Love from every Danger; I gave thee Life and Honour.âThis the World, Th'astonish'd World, who saw my unequal'd Passion Working thro' Miracles thy Safety, witness. JASON. My Heart, MedÃ¦a, is a grateful Witness; You need no farther Evidence. MEDÃA. Impeach'd By thy own Words, say, how hast thou return'd The Benefits receiv'd? Repeat thy Gratitude. Hast thou not violated every Bond Of Love, and Friendship? Quite estrang'd thy Mind, Tho' bless'd with beauteous Children, tho' belov'd, Tho' doated onâOh my wrong'd Heart;âto Death, To more than Death?âWedded another Woman? Dost thou believe that there are Powers, who rule The human Race? Or dost thou think, weak Man, The Gods, who govern'd once, are now no more? JASON. I find my Presence but enflames your Rage When you are fit to hear and to receive Assistance and Advice, I will return. MEDÃA. Stay;âyou shall hear me; yes, I'll talk as cooly As if I had receiv'd some Benefit From thee; as unconcern'd, as tamely reason As thou dost, who hast wrong'd me. Say! Advise! Where shall I go? My Father is betray'd, For thee betray'd; my Country too for thee Is lost; shall I return to Pelias Daughters? They slew their Father for thy sake and safety By my Intreaty. Hated by the World, Forsaking all for thee, I priz'd thy Love Beyond the lesser Ties of Blood, or Friendship, Or Faith, or Honour; am I not rewarded? JASON. Accuse thy Fate; accuse the Gods, MedÃ¦a. MEDÃA. Well then, I go, expell'd, a Wanderer, Deserted, helpless, and in want; thy Children Those guiltless Innocents attend my Flight, They share my Miseries and ask their Bread In Climes unknown. Great is thy Fame, O Jason! Thy Glory will resound from Pole to Pole. O Jove, why didst thou fix thy unerring Stamp On Gold to mark the adulterate from the true, And gavest no Token to distinguish Man From Man; the righteous from the base Allay. JASON. It is my Duty, as a skilful Pilot, To guide thee, toss'd in these Extreams of Passion; Thou dost upbraid me with thy Obligations. 'Tis true thy Passion hurry'd thee to pass Numberless Labours in my Cause and Safety, And Gratitude is due to thee and Venus. 'Tis well; yet let us too recount the Blessings Thou hast receiv'd, great as the Debt I owe. MEDÃA. The Blessings! Perjur'd and ungrateful Man! Is Love contemn'd a Blessing? Jason, Jason! Are Exile, Want, and all the Indignities And Pangs a wounded Heart can suffer, Blessings? JASON. Hear me and then with Temper judge my Reasons. Thou dost object this Marriage here in Corinth; The strong Necessity that urg'd thus answers; 'Twas Friendship, Wisdom, and the chaste Desire Of saving thee and thine from instant Evils, When first we left, abandon'd by our Friends, The Shores of Cholchis, destitute, forlorn; What more cou'd an unhappy Exile wish, Than thus to make Allyance with a Prince, Honour'd and lov'd? Do not unjustly think That the Desire of Change, or a new Passion Seduced my Soul. Thy Beauties warm me still; Thy fruitful Bed hath honour'd me with Children; Nor cou'd my tender Mind support a Thought That thee and thine shou'd suffer any Want. That I might raise thy Name and House again, Therefore I wedded Creon's Daughter. Say, Does not the Circumstance excuse the Crime. MEDÃA. Excuse thy Crime! O lawless, impious Man! JASON. MedÃ¦a, wou'd thy jealous Rage subside, I say thy Reason must extenuate, Perhaps applaud my Care. MEDÃA. I think the Man, who dares to dress Misdeeds And colour them with Virtue's Name, deserves A double Punishment from Gods and Men. If you intended these Corinthian Nuptials A Blessing to your Family, declare Why was not I consulted? Was my Right Or Leave unworthy once to be demanded? Why was this Contract huddl'd in the Dark? I'll tell thee, 'twas a black, clandestine Deed, And wou'd not bear the Light. JASON. I will no longer litigate in Words. If from my Hand you will receive a Boon, I come to offer you Support, and Guards, And Treasure to sustain you and the Children. It is not Wisdom to refuse Assistance, Tho' from a hated Hand; tho' you unjustly Believe me still your Foe, receive my Aid. MEDÃA. Away! My Soul disdains to commune with thee; No, let us perish all; In Want and Exile perish by Degrees, Rather than owe the smallest Obligation To Creon's Son. JASON. Immortal Gods! I call your sacred Deities to witness I wou'd relieve my Children, I wou'd help MedÃ¦a's Sufferings, but her haughty Mind, With contumacious Pride, scorns my Benevolence. [Exit Jason. MEDÃA alone. Haste to your new made Spouse; go, cherish Her. Oh! my tortured Breast! It burns! ten thousand Scorpions sting my Bosom! All other Evils intermit and feel Some interval of Ease. âBut the forsaken Lover's Pangs remain A lasting and unutterable Pain; There Anger, Fear, Distraction, Horror, Rage The torn, tumultuous Soul at once engage, Forlorn like me, for ever doom'd to prove (Relentless Gods!) the Pangs of jealous Love. [Exit MedÃ¦a. ETHRA, ÃGÃUS. ETHRA. Behold, ÃgÃ¦us, Jason has left her, stung with jealous Pangs, And now she seeks Repose, seeks it in vain; Soon she'll be here again, her whirling Brain Gives her no Peace or Rest. ÃGÃUS. Let me behold her. ETHRA. Behold her; but alas! how wan, how chang'd From what she was, when first her magick Beauties Stole all ÃgÃ¦us from himself in Cholchis. ÃGÃUS. Oh I remember well the Day, the Hour; I saw her then, the Daughter of the King, Amidst her Virgins eminently fair, Blazing in Jewels, and magnifick Vestments, Proceed to sacrifice; the holy Path Cover'd with Roses; vocal Harmony And solemn Instruments proclaim'd the March; She look't and walk'd a Goddess. Oh that Day! ETHRA. Enough ÃgÃ¦us! When you see MedÃ¦a Let her believe you are but late arriv'd In Corinth, that imperfect you have heard Her Wrongs from Jason; she'll repeat her Wrongs, Warmly repeat them; That Occasion take; Your Friendship then, and not too hotly offer'd, May be receiv'd, for tho' she wants a Friend, I know her haughty Soul will weigh and ponder, And much she trusts the Man from whom she takes A Benefit, 'tis a high Mark of her Esteem Where she receives a Favour. ÃGÃUS. Well I know her. ETHRA. She comes, I will retire and hear your Conference. ÃGÃUS, MEDÃA, ETHRA. All hail, MedÃ¦a! Let me thus salute The Daughter of the Sun. MEDÃA. Health to ÃgÃ¦us; Health to the generous Son of wise Pandion. Why does the King of Athens tread this Soil? ÃgÃ¦us, you behold a banish'd Wretch, Proscrib'd, a Fugitive; and yet unknowing Whither to flyâ You once was pleas'd to stile yourself my Friend. ÃGÃUS. Witness it Heaven, I glory in the Title. MEDÃA. Then I may hope your Aid in my Misfortunes. ÃGÃUS. Curs'd be that Wretch! And hated let him perish; Who dares refuse Assistance to his Friend; Who does not freely open all his Breast, And manifest his honest, candid Heart. MEDÃA. I do not supplicate, nor bend my Knee; For know, when Kings, our earthly Deities, Assist and guard the weak and innocent They taste immortal Joys. This is thy Blessing; The Gods have cast before thy Throne an Object, Worthy thy royal Care, thy royal Mercy, An injur'd Woman, and two helpless Infants. In honour to him, they command ÃgÃ¦us To save, and keep us in Minerva's City, And Gods and Men, and Heav'n and Earth will sound The Glory of this Act, reserv'd for thee, ÃGÃUS. The Love of Virtue Now fires my Soul, uplifting it to Heaven; You have indeed confer'd a Blessing on me, Yes, Athens shall protect thee, Thee and Thine; The Gods, thy Children, thy Misfortunes, Justice, All plead thy Cause; yet is there somewhat more An Oratorâ MEDÃA. I know it well, ÃgÃ¦us; Humanity, the Pride of doing Good, Swells thy great Heart. ÃGÃUS. Alas! Alas! MedÃ¦a. MEDÃA. You say you will protect within your Realms Me and my Children. ÃGÃUS. Thee and Thine, MedÃ¦a. MEDÃA. 'Tis well; but plight thy Faith, thy holy Faith, Thou wou't perfom thy Promise. ÃGÃUS. Why thus diffident? Oh! Cou'dst thou read my Heart! MEDÃA. I do believe thee; But when I see the powerful House of Pelias And Creon both my Foes, I think thy Vows Would well become the Cause, and justify Thy Conduct; when the future Claims of Pelias Or Creon may demand me at at thy Hand; When Wealth, and Power, and strong Allyances May tempt thee to shake off the expensive Load. ÃGÃUS. For ever wise and provident MedÃ¦a, Oblige me to thee by the strongest Bonds. (Aside ...) Alas! she knows not, or she will not know How much I am her Slave. (... Aside) MEDÃA. Swear by the Earth; swear by the Sun, my Parent; Swear by the Synod of the assembled Gods.â ÃGÃUS. In thy own Words, MedÃ¦a. MEDÃA. To protect, To guard within thy Realm me and my Children; Never to give us up by Fraud, or Force, By publick Treaties, or clandestine Leagues. ÃGÃUS. Thou ever sacred Earth, our common Parent, And thou great Source of Light attest my Vow; Witness ye Gods in general Council met, I will protect MedÃ¦a and her Children. MEDÃA. Enough!âAnd if thou breakst this solemn Oathâ ÃGÃUS. Then may I taste those Pains, to which the Gods Doom an inhospitable, impious Man. MEDÃA. 'Tis done!âTherapion shall attend the King, And give him Notice when I pass the Limits Of this Corinthian Tyrant. ÃGÃUS. Every God, Auspicious, comfort and assist MedÃ¦a. [Exit ÃgÃ¦us. MEDÃA, ETHRA. MEDÃA. Oh Thunder-bearing Jove, most ancient Cause; And thou diffusive Good, Parent of Truth, Eternal Light! My glorious, great Avengers, Behold I bend before youâLo my Soul Pours forth her grateful Vows.âThe rising Hopes Advance and are enlarg'dâThe Prince is come; The Haven of this Weather-beaten Bark Is in our View; the Daughter of high Jove Will yet protect, and guard her Votary. ETHRA. This generous Prince has with heroick Warmth Espous'd thy Causeâand here the equal Gods Seem to have fix'd a Period to thy Sufferings; Here too perhaps their Justice may begin, And Jason feelâ MEDÃA. Hah! Yes, 'tis true my Heart Repeats the warm Idea;âlet me tell thee, This Greecian has deceiv'd me, but he shall, Yes, if the Gods consent, he shall have Justice. Returning Life bounds thro' my azure Veins And quickens every PulseâI will reveal My Soul to thee. Great Joys as well as Griefs Are social, Ethra;âI will send to Jason; Once more I will intreat to see the Man, And humble all my haughty Soul before him; He'll find that I can counterfeit a Calm As well as He, dissemble and be mean. ETHRA. I see thro' all thy feign'd Humility; Thy swelling Heart now drives thee on to Vengeance. MEDÃA. I will intreat Jason to interceed With fair Creusa, with his lovely Bride, That my two Children may remain in Corinth, Under their Father's Care. He will instruct them In the great useful Arts of living well With their Superiors, of dissembling well. ETHRA. This has been mov'd already and refus'd. MEDÃA. 'Tis said the Gods themselves are to be bribed. A Diadem of purest Gold, adorn'd With precious Gems, blazing in Eastern Day, A Robe lighter then Down, and thin as Air, Wrought by the sacred Nine, the mystick Web Inwove with Characters that circumscribe Yon planetary Worlds that move around us, The Sun's eternal Path and Cynthia's Circle. ETHRA. And if she grants their Prayer, if she receives Thy valuable Presents. MEDÃA. Hah! Receives them! I am content;âSister, they shall not say MedÃ¦a listless and insensible Droned out a Life inglorious and inactive. ETHRA. I know not whether you wou'd tend; I see Your Eyes enflam'd. Oh! Sister! Oh MedÃ¦a! Take, as you ought, this hospitable Blessing, And thank Minerva, who inspired the Prince. Think you will live in Athens, where ÃgÃ¦us, Royal and generous ÃgÃ¦us rules, A People, wise, invincible and free; Athens the Seat of Demi-Gods and Heroes, For Wisdom, and for Virtue far renown'd, There the Pierian Maids, as Fame reports, First planted golden Harmony, and there, On the smooth Surface of the fair Cephesus, The Cyprian Goddess fans the yeilding Waters With sweetest Odours, as she gently glides Down the soft silver Flood, to warm the Sons Of Wisdom and relieve their Cares with Love; Love the great Aid and Nurse of every Virtue. MEDÃA. The Business of this World is now no more, Knowledge, and Love, and every Charm in Life Fix'd to one single Point. Yet, Ethra, Sister, Yet let me mourn my Loss, and speak my Wrongs; It is the Wretches Comfort. Sad Philomela thus with plaintive Strain, Moaning her ravish'd little Ones in vain, Sings nightly sweet; the Woods her warbling Song Repeat;ârepeat the sadly moving Wrong, Inamour'd with the Musick of her Tongue. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Jason, MedÃ¦a, Ethra, Therapion and the Children of MedÃ¦a. JASON. Once more I wait upon your Will, tho' hated; Altho' an Object painful to your Eye, I do attend your Order; let him know What you command, and Jason will obey. MEDÃA. Jason, I wish the Folly of my Words May be forgot, may die, no more remember'd. Anger with Friends, like Obligations past, Should never be rehears'd. We have been Friends, And mutual Benefits receiv'd and given; Reason now governs here; a Penitent And self-convicted, lo I stand before thee; Yet pity me, since from a Brain unsound I err'd, and quarrel'd with my Benefactors. JASON. O Woman! Cou'dst thou now review thyself As in a Mirrour, and behold the Charms Chaste Manners give, thy Passions wou'd be held For ever in the Rein of godlike Reason. Thou know'st when we from Thessaly arriv'd In Corinth, friendless and a Prey to Wantâ MEDÃA. I know that we were Exiles then, and friendless; I have condemn'd, and censur'd with Imprudence; I own my Rage was ignorant and vain, Useless, unjust, injurious to myself And to my Friends; now, better taught, MedÃ¦a Blesses thy providential Care, and thanks The ever equal Gods for this Allyance. Fool that I was! I should have bent my Knee, My stubborn Heart, and, yielding to my Lot, Have learnt Humility from my Condition. But as we are, we are;âwith too much Fire My Soul inform'd consumes and wastes itself. âOh may my Sex from this Example learn To govern the wild Sallies of the Mind, Never returning Ill, for what their Passions Misguided, call an Ill; but in the Ballance Of holy Truth weigh every Word and Deed. JASON. Oh! had thy Soul been always temper'd thus, The World had envy'd Jason, and thy Sex Ambitiously aspir'd to copy from thee The fair Ideas of exalted Virtue. MEDÃA. My Children, good Therapion, let my Children Attend and witness this auspicious Hour; [Exit Therapion. That they too, when the Year revolving brings This Hour again, which reconcil'd their Parents, Enter Children. May bless the Light, and pay the Gods their Duty. Come near, ye little Ones, and kneel and thank Your Father Jason, that benign and good He has remitted all your Mother's Crimes. Give me thy Hand, and thine my younger Charm. How long shall I be able thus to hold you! How long embrace, and live upon your Features!â You must forgive me if the Tears now flow. My Children do in every Line confess Their Father Jason; I am used to bathe Their tender Bosoms with maternal Sorrow. JASON. The Passions of the Fair will have their way. For you, my Children, I have labour'd long To fix the Basis of your future Welfare, And, with the Favour of the Gods, I hope One Day to make you great, belov'd and powerful; That many Ages hence my Race may bless These happy Realms with wise, and virtuous Princes; Increase in Strength and Years, and leave the rest To those auspicious Gods, the Guards of Virtue, And an indulgent Father's wakeful Care; O that my Eyes may see you, ripe in Manhood, Superior to your Foes, in Strength and Wisdom! Hah! Wherefore dost thou weep, MedÃ¦a? Why Flow thus again thy Tears? Why dost thou turn Thy lilly Cheek? Does what I say displease? MEDÃA. No, no; these Objects busy'd all my Thoughts. JASON. Trust me, I will provide with Honour. MEDÃA. Jason, Forgive me; 'tis my Nature, 'tis the Failing Of our weak Sex, and Tears unbid will flow. But when I see my little Family Collected thus, a Blessing which my Eyes Can never hope again, these pious Drops May be excused;âOh think I bore them, Jason: Now I have doneâI did intend to say Wherefore we met, (but Grief broke in upon me.) The Princes of this Land have sentenc'd me To Banishment, and I applaud their Wisdom. I go a willing Exile, I obey The just Decree; but Oh! beseech the King My Children may remain; thy Care, thy Wisdom Will guide them in the Paths of sacred Knowledge. JASON. The King, with Reasons not to be refuted, Prevents my Prayer. MEDÃA. Then let Creusa plead; She will not be deny'd; the good old King Will listen to his Child, his Pride and Joy. JASON. Her Mind is happy when employ'd in Mercy. MEDÃA. I too will aid thy pious Supplication. The Gods themselves are pleas'd with Offerings; Creusa shall receive immortal Bribes, A Robe Ã¦therial, wrought by Hands divine, A Diadem of purest Gold; my Children Shall bear these Gifts; a hallow'd, magick Treasure Left by our Sire the Sun to bless his Race. JASON. For Gold, They want it most, who have it most; Yet is it known a smooth-tongu'd Orator; All the Gods second those, whom Fortune blesses. MEDÃA. Here will I trust my Cause; Creusa governs; A favourite Beauty, like Creusa, Jason, Reigns independent both of Gods and Men. [The Diadem and Robe brought on velvet Cushions. Take thou this Robe, and thou this Diadem; My Children, bear these nuptial Offerings Unto Creusa's Hands, your Father's Bride. Let us commute for Crimes by costly Victims Attone th'offended Deity by Prayer, By Sacrifice; may she receive auspicious This Incense which we offer at her Altar. JASON. No more of this, MedÃ¦a, tho' your Heart O'erflows; remember Praise may be offensive. MEDÃA. Thus then, my Children, when you enter first The Palace of the Princess, of Creusa, Your Father's new made Bride, my royal Mistress; Suppliant intreat, and on the bended Knee Ask the Remission of your Exile, then Into her Hands alone deliver lowly These hallow'd Gifts; returning then with Joy Bring me the happy Tidings of Success. JASON. Thy pious Care for these our other-selves Dilates and warms my Heart, and I forgive, Forget the past; I too will bear my Part; I will conduct them to Creusa's Hand. I think their Looks alone will plead their Cause; Creusa too prejudges in their Favour, And every Hour solicits this Remission. MEDÃA. 'Tis wellâTherapion, wait upon your Charge; Thus let the Children bear the Gifts themselves, And let no strange, unhallow'd Hand prophane them. [Jason goes off first, the Children together, and Therapion follows. MEDÃA, ETHRA. MEDÃA. Now Vengeance to Work. Lo pale Erynnis From black Cocytus leads a Band of Furies; They clink their Chains of Adamant, they howl, And, grinning ghastly Joy, demand the Sacrifice. Behold she comes, Creusa, Pluto's Bride, His Diadem now binds her Head, his Robe Infolds herâ ETHRA. Wherefore are you thus convuls'd? Your mystick Word conceal some dreadful Meaning. MEDÃA. Ethra, we go; to Pluto's Realms descend; My Children too, cut in their early Bloom, Fall by the Tyrant's Hand. ETHRA. Thy Brain o'erwrought, Hath broke at length the reas'ning Chain. MEDÃA. Alas! Thou know'st it not, we will philosophise; The Distance of an Age, or of an Hour, Is in eternal Records not remember'd; Then whether we die now, and let all pass As in a Dream; no, let us live one Hour, And stand erect on the triumphant Ruin. Hah! Dost thou hear that Noise? Does not that Shreik Sound from old Creon's Palace? All Confusion, Amazement, Horror, Howling, and a Cry Of Treason! Murther!âGlorious Harmony! [Exit Ethra. MedÃ¦a runs off. The Apartment of the Women in the Palace of Creon. CREUSA, IRIS. CREUSA. The morning Light, serenely beautiful, Chears every Form; the whole Creation smiles, Benign and good; the genial Blessing, Iris, Gives equal Warmth, and Nourishment to all. IRIS, Bless'd be the Day, Creusa, bless'd the Morn Next in Succession to the bridal Light, Nor was there one fair Hour in all the Waste Of circling Time deserv'd so well the White. CREUSA, Away! No more of Adulation, Iris; Truth is the fairest Ornament of Thrones. Princes should like the God of Day dispense To all within their Shine.âBe that Day lost, Unnumber'd with my happier Hours of Life, Wherein my idle Hand has done no Benefit. My Father, ever good, and gracious to me, Consents that Jason's Children shall remain; The Sentence of their Exile is remitted; This warms my Heart, this fills my Soul with Joy. Jason, Therapion, the Children of MedÃ¦a, Iris; Jason introducing the Children. Behold this Remnant of the House of Peleas, The last Descendants of old Ãson's Race; Behold the Children of thy Servant Jason. CREUSA. [to Iris. His Children Iris! Did he say his Children? Something, alas! now sickens in my Blood, A thrilling Chilness creeps along my Veins. [Leaning on Iris. JASON. Why dost thou turn away thy Eyes? Oh why Dost thou avoid the Children of thy Friend? CREUSA. Yes, I am hurt;âa tender blushing Sorrow, A Fear, I never knew before this Hour, And mix'd with Guilt, appales me; tell me, Jason, Have we done well? Say, will the Gods approve This Work of human Policy? JASON. The Gods Have by the Priests, their Servants, all approv'd, And hallow'd in their Auspices our Nuptials; But Fear is Superstition. Why, Creusa, Why dost thou weep? These little Innocents Intreat thy Favour; look thou kindly on them, And they are happy. CREUSA. Oh my trembling Heart! What is it that I wou'd not do to bless them? Somewhat within me tells me I am wrong, And I methinks shou'd kneel and pray to them. JASGN. The tender Supplicants behold in Pain Thy Fears, Creusa; with a Smile relieve them. CREUSA. Come hither, Child; thy Father's little Image; O cou'dst thou, Jason, cou'dst thou ever mean To part with these two Models of Thyself? Behold this Boy,âeach blooming Feature speaks; A knowing Eye, an open, manly Front; Neither a daring, nor a suppliant Brow; A comely Form, that gives Regard and Pleasure, As in a noble Building, Harmony, Awes, and delights at once the pleas'd Spectator. JASON. No more MedÃ¦a bears that lawless Will, Wont to controul and menace and insult, She prays, intreats and supplicates in Terms Low as her Fortune, and deserves Compassion. CREUSA. I thought that Mind, undisciplin'd and fiery, Cou'd never be reduced. JASON. She much condemns The Folly of her Ways, and as a Proof At what a Price she wishes to attone Her Errors past, sends these immortal Gifts; The God of Day (tho' cloath'd in purest Light,) Disdain'd not from the Muses to receive Those sacred Boons, (that Diadem and Robe) And to his Children left th'Ã¦therial Treasure, Indued with many Virtues. [The Children kneel and Creusa receives the Presents, and places them near her. CREUSA. I receive them; With Joy receive them. Tell MedÃ¦a, Children, I am her Friend, I never was her Foe; And when she deigns, and by such Orators To send, I blush I've nothing to return; But when I hear MedÃ¦a's Soul is touch'd, And that she greatly condescends to think Her Conduct has been wrong, it gives me Joy; For self Conviction is the Path to Virtue. An honourable Candor thus adorns Ingenuous Minds; the hard and ignorant, As 'tis with Pain they look into themselves, But little feel, and less reform their Errors. JASON. Behold once more your pious Supplicants; Now, my Creusa, for themselves they plead, Let me, who am their Father, be their Advocate; They are condemn'd to wander thro' the World, A wide tempestuous World without a Pilot; Without one favourable Star to guide Their tender Feet across the pathless Desart. CREUSA. The Sentence of their Exile is repeal'd; My Father, ever gracious and benevolent, At length has granted my Request. JASON. Oh, Creon! May every God show'r down his Blessings on thee, As thou art merciful, and good to all! CREUSA. These Boys are now my Charge, I will supply, Well as I may, the mourning Mother's Loss; It is a great one; and my Trust is great. In Arms and Arts, let Jason far renown'd Instruct his Sons, and form their Minds to Glory; Be it my Care indulgently to nurse Their tender Bloom, and guard from every Blight The royal Scyons.âCome, my little Wards, Give me your Hands; thus do I plight my Faith, [Kisses the Children. And when I cease to cherish these Remains Of Ãson's House, then Childless let me fall, Nor know the Joy that Mothers only know, When the Heart leaps to see an Infant smile. JASON. This is the great Deposit of the Gods; Well have they delegated thee their Guardian. Ingrafted thus, th'enobled Fruit shall take New Honours from Adoption, and arise The Pleasure and the Pride of wondring Greece. CREUSA. Say to your Mother, to my Friend MedÃ¦a, That I had long solicited her Cause, And e're these Presents reach'd me, was successful. Tell her I often mourn her hapless Fate, And drop a Tear, and sigh, and pray the Gods To mitigate her Pains, and aid her Virtues. Say, I receive with Joy and Gratitude Her godlike Gifts, and long as Life will hold These Tokens of returning Amity. Tell her, for so you shall e're you depart, You saw my Maids invest me with these Honours, And that I glory'd in the friendly Offerings, More than the Garlands of my bridal Bed. Friendship restor'd is the sincerest Joy. Iris, attend.âTherapion, let the Children Behold Creusa bind the golden Cincture Around her Temples, and observe this Veil, The Muses hallow'd Work, adorn their Servant. [Exeunt omnes. The Apartment of MedÃ¦a. MEDÃA, ETHRA. MEDÃA. Giddy and vain, fond of exterior Pomp, Th'ambrosial Veil will tempt her, and the blaze Of the rich Diadem inchant her Eye; âShe wears them now. Daughter of lawless Creon, This is the gaudy Garniture of Death; These are the Robes of Fate. ETHRA. Oh most unhappy! Has thy nefarious Hand ruin'd at once Thy self and thy whole Race? Flagrant Iniquity! Weak, wicked, thoughtless Woman! both thy Children Will suffer Death in Tortures. MEDÃA. Both my Children! That hurts indeed, when once the living Pulse Ceases to strike, nor Herbs, nor Arts restore; Then what avail thy Powers? Thy Pow'rs grow weak And sicken with thee. Once the Sons of Knowledge Astonish'd saw the Wonders of my Hand. The silver Queen of Night, aw'd by my Charms, Check'd her Career, now struck with other Passions Than when on Latmos Top th'enamour'd Goddess Embrac'd her favourite Boy.âMy Art restor'd Old Ãson's Youth, soften'd the hard Canals Of rigid Age, and fill'd his sinking Veins With milky Chyle; while Nature shook to see Her Laws revers'd, and human Matter circling In the same Form beyond her fix'd Decree. And what is all this Knowledge? Oh thou Trifler! Hath thy vain Wisdom taught thee to controul One idle Passion?â ETHRA. Therapion and your Children are return'd, A smiling Joy triumphant in their Looks Sits, the glad Messenger of happy Tidings. Enter Therapion and the Children. Hail to MedÃ¦a, lo, your Children live Free and in Health, no longer doom'd to Exile, The royal Bride, divinely good, receiv'd Your Gifts with humble Grace, her humid Eyes Spoke Gratitude sincere, while Tears of Joy Bedew'd her smiling Features.âwhen her Handâ MEDÃA. âHahâ! THERAPION. Why dost thou turn aside thy troubled Face? Are then my Words ungrateful to thy Ear? MEDÃA. Alas! alas! THERAPION. How ill does this agree With the good Tidings that I bring! MEDÃA. away! THERAPION. Indeed I thought to gladden thy pleas'd Ear With Words of Joy, but somewhat inauspicious Drops from my fatal Tongue, unwitting, ignorant MEDÃA. What thou hast said, is said;âI blame not thee. THERAPION. Then wherefore are thy Eyes cast down? Oh why Loaden with heavy Waters, do they droop? MEDÃA. Old Man, the various Passions of my Soul Are not in Words to paint. THERAPION. Trust to the Gods; Thy Children live protected, free, in Corinth. MEDÃA. Tis right,âyet first we sacrifice to Pluto. THERAPION. Nor art thou yet the first unhappy Mother, Divided from her Children. Think, MedÃ¦a, It is the Duty of the wise and good To bear the Burthen of their Woes with Patience MEDÃA. You say the royal Bride was pleas'd, Therapion. Doubting and anxious for the great Event, My trembling Blood retires [Aside âYou say Creusaâ THERAPION. In tender Words and most indearing Looks She promis'd to supply their Mother's Loss. Her royal House, she said, should be their Refuge, And her own careful Hand protect and serve them; She bless'd the Tokens of your Love restor'd, Nor would she suffer us to leave her Presence, Till we beheld her dress'd in the gay Robe And royal Diadem. MEDÃA. Say that again. THERAPION. Yes, we beheld the shining Diadem Inshrine her Temples, and the Robe her Limbs. MEDÃA. The Work is done! Thou tell'st me pleasing News; Henceforth Therapion, lose the Name of Servant; Thou art my Benefactor and my Friend. THERAPION. Now in the polish'd Mirrour she survey'd Her Charms improv'd, a conscious Smile arose And heighten'd every Feature, MEDÃA. Enough! the Debts of injur'd Love are satisfy'd; The noisy Business of this Life is done. Draw near, my Children, my lov'd better Parts; Still the dear precious Partners of my Woe. In vain a royal House, a princely Refuge Is offer'd you, Fate has ordain'd it otherwise; Sudden the great Calamity is come, And we must die together; fall at once A solemn Sacrifice to Love and Vengeance. Fondly I once believ'd my Eyes should see you Increase in Strength and Years, two blooming Heroes, In Arms and Virtue great; I vainly wish'd To adorn your nuptial Beds and bear a Torch Before the solemn Rites; alas! alas! How has my obdurate Folly ruin'd all? THERAPION. Behold the Mother's Love now fills her Soul And her maternal Piety alone Obliges every Passion to recede. No more indulge your Griess; leave to the Gods The Care of Virtue; many Years may waste, And you may meet again, when these dark Clouds Are pass'd, and long enjoy a happy Calm. MEDÃA. You know not then, that now we part for ever, Nor in what Manner. Hear me, good Therapion. Fate is approachingâHah! 'tis well; we'll meet him Gay as young Bridegrooms, as the wounded Victor After a Conquest gain'd. They weep, bless'd Innocents! They look into my Eyes and beg for Mercy; This Burthen is not light.âSupport me, Ãthra. ETHRA. Perhaps Creusa (may the Gods permit it!) Has scap'd thy magick Toils; perhaps she lives. MEDÃA. No, no, the Diadem now binds her Brow, And in my Robes Jason's new Wife expires. I am prepar'd for Death, nor is that hard; Death is a long and an inconscious Sleep, And every Passion conquers and contemns it; But it is more, much more than Death to part With these dear Pledges, once of mutual Love. Once more, my Boys, a parting Kiss and then Farewel for ever.âOh the sweet Embrace! Thus have I held you oft in happier Moments, Scan'd every Feature, liv'd upon your Smiles; O the dear tender Babes! farewel, farewel! May all the Gods protect you, and may Jason Remember you are his. [Medea carried off. THERAPION. Ethra, she sinks. ETHRA. Support her to her CouchâImmortal Gods! How various are our Passions and how violent. THERAPION. What mean MedÃ¦a's Words? Why talks she thus Of Death, and of her Children; tell me, Ethra? ETHRA. The Presents, oh Therapion, those envenom'd And deadly Presents have destroy'd us all; The poison'd Web, the fatal Diadem; Creusa! hapless Bride! THERAPION. I might have mark'd, Too late I do, a baleful Joy, a Smile, With Vengeance mingled, sat upon her Brow. Why are our Passions suffer'd to subdue And thus lay waste.â ETHRA. Why all these Things are thus Is hard to say; the smiling Sun beholds The wide Creation preying on it self, And the frail Creature breathes and lives on Ruin. ArachnÃ© thus unwinds her silken Threads, And Webs unseen th'insidious Insect spreads; The royal Bee, Queen of the Rosy Bower, Collects her precious Sweets from every Flower; Now loads her little Limbs with anxious Care, Now trys her slender Pinions in the Air; Then homeward as she wings her fragrant Way, Rich in the thymy Labours of the Day. Sudden she strikes at once th'invenom'd Loom, And finds a dreadful, and lamented Doom. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Womens Apartment, Creon's Palace. Euriale, Melyssa, Eumelus, Servants in the Train of Creusa. EURIALE. O most flagitious Woman! Curs'd MedÃ¦a! MELYSSA. What Ravage has her jealous Phrensy caus'd! What Desolation in the House of Creon! But yester Sun beheld the smiling Bride In gratulating Circles, joyous, happy; And now in agonizing Pains she dies, The Victim of a jealous Woman's Vengeance. EURIALE. Torn from her Father's, from her Husband's Arms, The hymenÃ¦al Feasts but just begun, Lo she descends to Pluto's Realms a Victim. EUMELUS. The poison'd Crown now cleaves around her Temples, Boils in her Veins, and in her Eye-balls blazes; She mourns, she raves, and throws her Eyes to Heaven, And now, depriv'd of Words, or Strength to utter, The silent Anguish streaming down her Cheek Pleads her Distress; the Snares of Death surround her; The raging Phrensy doubles all her Strength, And, midst the Tortures she endures, exerts A Vigour more than human. O Creusa, Unhappy Bride, divinely fair and good, Was there a Mind so pure, guileless, and tender; Imbitter'd with no Gaul, swoln with no Pride; Her Rank, her Birth, her Beauties took no Teint From the mean Praise of Courts, to Truth devoted; Her Manners, like her Form, chast and harmonious. Immortal Gods! Man will believe your Vengeance Led by the Hand of Chance, when thus he sees Your Fires lay waste your own most hallow'd Temples. She comes, most piteous Sight; how painful 'tis But to behold her Sufferings! Poor Creusa! Creusa and Iris, Creusa led in by Servants. IRIS. Soft let us tread, and lead her gently on; Here, the refreshing Breezes from the Sea May for a while perhaps releive her Pains. Look down, ye Gods, with pity on her Sufferings. CREUSA. Iris, my faithful Iris to the last, I thank thee for thy Care, I trouble thee; It will not now be long, I feel my Strength Abates, and the malignant Fires increase. Ye righteous Powers, to whose eternal Justice This Creature of your Will submissive bends, I ask not why I sufferâwretched Outcast! Elate with Blessings, overweening, vain, I saw the springing Glories blosom round me, My Speech descended as refreshing Dews, Silent amid my virgin Choir I pass'd, Rever'd and lov'd.âYet what I fear'd is come; The Terrors of the Gods set in array Attack my Soul; 'twas wrong; it was Adultery; And thus I satisfy, as 'tis most just, The violated Laws of injur'd Wedlock. EUMELUS. Thy Father, and the Sages of the Realm, The sacred Servants of the Gods, the Priests, Have all pronounc'd thy Marriage, just, and lawful. Wou't thou impeach the Wisdom of the Land? CREUSA. Where, tell me, where is Wisdom to be found? Priests barter it for Gold;âthe Polititian Mistakes his little crafty Guile for Wisdom. [Raving] âO hold me, Iris, bind me fast; I burn; âConsuming Flames surround and eat my Sinews; âLet all the Ionian and ÃgÃ¦an Seas âPass o'er my Head; hide me in mountain Snow; âLook in those Clouds, behold MedÃ¦a yonder; âThe soaring Eagle mounts upon the Rocks, âFar off she seeks her Prey, she stoops, her Pounces âDart Jove's appointed Thunder; in my Bosom âThe Bolts are lodg'd. Iris, thy Hand, thy Hand; âDraw forth these bearded Arrows. EUMELUS. How her Pains Disturb her Reason! as they abate and lessen Reflection comes again; and thus her Woes Are pointed with severe Variety. CREUSA. Wherefore is Life bestow'd upon the wretched? The Slave, when the hard Labours of the Day Are pass'd, enjoys refreshing Shade and Rest; I am the Daughter of a King and want it. Oh! let me sleep for ever in the Womb Of dark Oblivion; there the wicked cease To think, and there the weary find Repose. EUMELUS. Ye pitying Gods, look down and grant her Prayer. CREUSA. The Gods can tell, nor do I boast my Virtues. Once I was happy, when my liberal Hand Releiv'd Necessity, or cherish'd Merit; The Ear that heard me bles'd me; and the Heart Of the poor Fatherless and Widow joy'd. EUMELUS. O were thy Virtues weigh'd against thy Errors, This great Calamity wou'd cease, Creusa. âShe sighs; her Bosom swells; the scalding Tears Flow down her Cheeks; her Pains return and double. CREUSA. [Ravings return] âThe Aspick's Poison, and the Viper's Tongue âNow riot here.âTake my Advice, my Girl; âInvade not thou thy Neighbour's Bed, her sworn âAnd hallow'd Property,âthe jealous Matron âInvokes the Gods, and calls up every Fury. âMedÃ¦a will pursue thee, fiery Scorpions âDevour thy Flesh, and burning Calentures âDrink up thy Blood.âSoftlyâlet me reposes âOn Beds of Roses, Lillies, Amaranths, âThe purple Hyacinth, and fair Narcissus âSelf-loving Daffadil, breathe round my Head, âAnd with refreshing Odours cool my Brain. ââHide me, ye Virgins, lo she comes, she is here! âFlagrant Alecto shakes her snaky Locks; âO cover me, amidst the Sweets of Nature âHide me for ever. EUMELUS. Her boiling Brain consumes, Oh! What a Sight will Creon here behold! Where is the King? IRIS. When he receiv'd this News, He sunk o'ercharg'd with Grief; the deep learn'd Leeches Around him wait his slow Return to Life. EUMELUS. Thrice happy if the Gods had now dismiss'd him, That this calamitous and touching Sight Might not oppress his Soul with heavier Woes, And more acute than he can feel in Death. CREUSA. Said you my Father, did I hear his Voice? ââBring Aromaticks, let the PhÅnix here âLight all her funeral Spices at this Bosom. âThe Palace is in FlamesâO Jason, Creon! âCreon once lov'd his Child, and Jason swore, âBut he is used to swearâMedÃ¦a knows âWith how much Truth.âMy Father slain! Alas! âBehold the good old Man weltering in Blood; âThe Guards there.âNay this Crimson is too faint, âThe tyrian Dye does betterâyet it sits âUneasy here, this heavy Weight of Empire. EUMELUS. Euryale, her Breath grows short, her Eyes Are clos'd! Convulsions tear her trembling Nerves; Now raise her Head, and lay her gently down; Thanks to the Gods her Dissolution comes. [Iris and Euryale repose her on a Couch on the right Side of the Stage from the Audience. Enter Creon. CREON. Yet, ere I die, let me hehold my Child; Yet let my Arms infold her, let my Eyes In Tears of Blood bemoan thee, poor Creusa! Thou dear Oblation for thy Father's Crimes, The Follies of thy Father and thy Husband; Dost thou not know me? Is my Voice a Stranger? Lift up thy Eyes, the Cheer of Day, the Light In which I joy'dâOh sadly moving Object! How heavily they beam their dying Fires. CREUSA. I thought my Pains cou'd never be augmented. My Father,ânow I feel thy Sorrows too; âYour Handâwill you remember your Creusa, And learn from her, that neither Wealth nor Honours Nor Policy,âbut Justiceâmakes us happy. Creusa dies. CREON. She's gone, for ever goneâis then this Heart Of Adamant, and has old Age so dry'd And wither'd me, that not one Tear will fall. Farewel my GirlâO 'tis too much, too much; I thought I cou'd resignâmy stubborn Heart RebelsâYe Gods I merited your Jugdments; In Follies old, and practis'd in the Ways Of foolish Policy and human Foresight; How cou'd this Innocent provoke your Wrath? Hah Creon! Cou'd there be a surer Way To shake thy Peace than Thisâmy Senses staggerâ The Sky's o'ercast,âlo the pale Lightening's flash; The tottering Earth unfolds her yawning Graves; The Flowers all wither, and the Verdure fades; The Raven and the Owl shreik in my Ear. âThere, there she lies, speechless and pale Creusa. Creon after this Speech stands motionless at some Distance from Creusa, pointing to her, till Jason's Speech is ended. Enter Jason. JASON, CREON. Iris with her Face to the Earth and the other Servants in still and mourning Attitudes. [Jason advancing to Creusa. It is too true; Creusa! Oh Creusa! Silent and pale, the tuneful Soul is fled; She is as she had never been; her Words No more shall chear; those beauteous Eyes no more Shall bless me with their Light; for ever clos'd; Heart breaking Sight! Oh miserable Jason! Why did the Gods permit this Sacrilege? 'Tis well, this Mourning and this Silence add A decent Horror; let eternal Darkness For ever mark this Day; the conscious Sun Should blush to view the Crimes of his Descendent. Hah! Good old Creon, petrify'd with Grief, His own sad Monument.âI do not ask thee, Thou venerable Worthy, not to greive; Thou art a Father; and a Man;âand what Creusa wasâmy Heart's too full to say. CREON. Jason, thou seest a poor, infirm, old Man, Oppress'd with sudden Grief; if Tears descend Fast down my furrow'd Cheek, or if my Words Idle and incoherent fall, forgive me; Pardon the Weakness of grey Hairs, and think How much I lov'd my Child; old Age will doat, Nor can I bear my Sorrows like a Man. JASON. Thou dost not bear thy Sorrows like a Man, But as a Being of superior Nature, Still foremost in the Ranks, the Guide of Virtue. CREON. Look there, the Grave has level'd all Distinction; Yet a few Moments dedicate to Truth; Too much already has that Toy, Ambition, The Child of Vanity and Ignorance, Deluded and betray'd us both to Folly. JASON. It is too true, the Bubble breaks in Air, And all our Arts are vain, vain and destructive. Cholchis, thou art aveng'd; behold I sink Beneath a complicated Load of Woe, And thro' Creusa's, and the Breast of Creon Thy Arrows peirce.â Naked and desolate amid the Flames I stand, abandon'd to Despair and Death; A sad Spectator of the mighty Ruin. Canst thou behold me Creon? Canst thou bear To commune with a Wretch, thy House's Bane? Source of all Ill; Oh join with me and curse, Curse this ill chosen, and unhappy Friend. CREON. Jason, amidst the Woes that press us hard, Let us collect our Virtues to a Point; Tho' cover'd with a Host of Foes, retain Our Strength and Honour while we may;âour Passions Are evil Counsellors; their Rule is done; But if you wou'd have Vengeanceâ JASON. Hah! 'tis true, What wou'd my Prince; command, and be confirm'd My Heart is thine; shall I then place a Dagger Before your Eyes in curs'd MedÃ¦a's Bosom? Or wou'd you that my Children bleed to expiate This most inhuman Deed?âI am prepar'd. CREON. Has then my Soul discover'd any Rancour? Or does my loud-tongu'd Rage demand Revenge? Say, will the Punishment we give MedÃ¦a Restore again the Life of lov'd Creusa? MedÃ¦a has been wrong'd; wrong'd in Excess; And when no human Power cou'd do her Right, Her Hand did (Oh severe Remembrance!) punish. If with Impatience, and without a Warrant, She snatch'd a Debt due to the Gods alone, Let her Temerity instruct us, Jason, Not so to act. JASON. Oh godlike, worthy Prince! CREON. Since it hath pleas'd high Heaven, my Race no more Shall rule this Land. To thee I recommend My brave Achaians, Sons of ancient Virtue. Seek not to govern by the Lust of Power; Make not thy Will the Law; believe thy People Thy Children all; so shalt thou kindly mix Their Interests with thy own, and fix the Basis Of future Happiness in godlike Justice. JASON. Let me look up and learn, From this Example, what is great and good. CREON. Learn then, no Happiness can be secure, Placed in whatever lies beyond our Power. How vainly did I striveâ(senseless Ambition!) To lengthen out a Name to future Ages, And in a Race of Heroes found my Glories; As if the Gods had granted to the Sons Of virtuous Men, hereditary Virtues, Or that amidst the Transports of Elysium, These trifling Cares cou'd give us Pain or Pleasure. JASON. Thy Words, sweetly descending, drop as Oil, The Balm of wounded Minds. CREON. Now I have done; But narrative old Age will have its Way. I have liv'd enough to Nature and to Glory, Let my grey Hairs and Wounds plead my Discharge. Driven to the Verge of Life, I ask the Gods Their Leave to quit; a worn and aged Chiefâ Creon stabs himself. 'Tis done! My faithful Hand hath aim'd aright. Jason, farewel,âwhen next we meet, my Friend, 'Twill be in Fields of Joy, where no false Glories Delude us with imaginary Good. Rest on the Wing, Creusa; check thy Flight; Await thy aged Sire;âthis Flesh shook off, He mounts with thee to empyrÃ¦al Skies, And thinner Air. [Creon is led by the Servants, and dies in a Chair near Creusa. JASON, alone The noble Pillar sinks!âMajestick Ruin! Behold an upright Being! Just and wise; Just Princes must be wise;âthe most unknowing May be a Tyrant, as he rules by Force; His little Politicks are Chains and Axes, And Force alone, superior to Resistance, Requires his Hand to govern, not his Head. To rule by their own Laws a happy People, To found the Power and Grandeur of the Prince In the Prosperity and Wealth of Millions, This is the Art of Empire; this is Wisdom; This is to rule like Creon.âO my Prince!â [Here the Servants bear off the Bodies of Creusa and Creon. Methinks I stand as when the Darts of Heaven Lay waste the Earth, and pestilential Fires Consume Mankind. I see my dearest Friends Drop by my Side, and with a stupid Eye [Enter ETHRA. Survey the wild and desolate Creation, Inactive and unfeelingâEthra, where, Where is this curs'd Inchantress? This Destroyer? ETHRA. When she receiv'd the News of Creon's Death, And fair Creusa's most untimely Fate, She bade the Priests do present Sacrifice, And strait their Incense rose in Flames auspicious; Her agonizing Soul was torn and shook As she address'd in Prayer the God her Sire; When lo! Far as our aking Eye can peirce The solar Day; a Ball of living Light, Self-pois'd in Air, shot from its fiery Circle, And, passing swift thro' yon unfathom'd Ãther, Parted the level Azure in its Course; As nearer it descended, my weak Eye Cou'd mark no more.âMedÃ¦a dissappear'd. JASON. Hah! Ethra, where! Where are the Children? Say? ETHRA. Her anxious Mind, now jealous of their Fate, Since her perfidious Arts have prov'd successful, Hath guarded them with an uncommon Care; But where, she only knows. JASON. Ethra, my Children Are now my only Care; I fear the Citizens; Oh shou'd they punish on the guiltless Children The Mother's Crimes! haste then and and let us search, And give her up to Justice, to the Citizens; Relentless Woman! Tho' one partial God Protects her, Themis, in her equal Ballance, The Daughter of high Jove, will judge her Crimes. Where is this Sorceress? This faithless Friend? This complicated Evil? Hah! Thunder and Coruscations in the Air, when the flat Scene opens and a Cloud appears, which disperses; then MedÃ¦a is discovered descending from the Chariot of the Sun described with golden Rays &amp;c. MedÃ¦a advancing toward Jason. MEDÃA. Well are you come The Inquisitors of Death! If here you seek The Minister of Fate, behold MedÃ¦a! No nearer! Lo the God, from whose high Lineage Injur'd MedÃ¦a did descend to honour Thy mortal Bed, protects and owns his Race. Weak and misguided Man, MedÃ¦a's Guards, Beyond thy reach, deride thy feeble Rage. Say, wherefore did thy Voice demand, in Threats, To see MedÃ¦a.? JASON. To require my Children; Where are they; speak? MEDÃA. Dost thou not know, weak Man? Sprung from thy mortal Loins, they cou'd not bear The Glories that surround and guard their Mother; Unable to sustain etherial Day. Therefore I fear'd and did expect each Moment To see them dragg'd by the unthinking Populace To Tortures and to Death; when good ÃgÃ¦us Receiv'd them like a Prince, their guardian God; The silver Prows part the cerulean Plain, And now, ev'n now, they steer their Course for Athens. JASON. It is too much! I wou'd have seen my Children; now bereft Of every Comfort, every Joy in Life. MEDÃA. 'Tis true, Calamities are fall'n upon thee. Where are the shouting Crowds, who press'd to see Thy Chariot pass, and scatter'd Roses round thee? Where are the Minstrels now, who sounded high The bridal Song? Where is the gilded Circle, That bent the flattering Knee and bless'd thy Bed? Where are the Priests, who sanctify'd thy Nuptials? Where are the Gods, who gave their lucky Auspices? Where is thy royal Father, fam'd for Politicks, And wicked Wiles? And lastly tell me, Jason, Where is thy blooming Bride? JASON. Oh cease, MedÃ¦a, cease, nefarious Woman, Thus to insult me with thy own bad Deeds; I sink beneath the Woes thy Hand has caus'd. MEDÃA. He falls!âThis Sight strikes yet a deeper Wound Than all my Wrongs;âmy Triumph is no more Jason, thou art a Victor still!âBehold, Oh see this bleeding Heart, submissive, bending, The lowest Slave of Love!âAll Nature once, Each Element submitted to my Laws, Yet have my powerless Charms in vain attempted To move the Heart of one relentless Man. I goâ[Wounds herself] Let the pure Elements divide This hapless Form, and reassume their own; And thou bright Essence, from whose Source I sprung, Receive this Particle of Fire immortal; Which has, perhaps with too severe Resentment, Enflam'd an injur'd Wife. [MedÃ¦a dies. ETHRA. From this Example We learn, all Power or Wealth, acquir'd by Rapine, Will moulder in the Hand, or rob the Soul Of sweet Repose. Behold the House of Creon; Place this sad Monument before thy Eyes, And know; he only, who is Just, is Wise. The End of the fifth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue; by a Friend. You've seen how terribly, in Days of Yore, Resentful Dames a Husband's Falshood bore! Sure! Those same Ancients were a dreadful Nation, Where a wrong'd Wife's Revengeâwas Desolation? But I suppose the Comforts they were robb'd of, Were other Things than those, with which we're fob'd of. At least our Christian Patience is much better; We have milder Ways of making up the Matter. We, if a Discount in our Dues we find, Make up the Sum andâpay our Dears in kind. While Spouse with Miss believes he sups much better, We treat Sir Harry snugâtwo Plates, and one Dumbwaiter. In our Revenge, you see, we have some Remorse; Nay, when the Wife's the Aggressor 'teen't much worse. For, say, in her Amour, the Fair's found out, We've still a Way to hush the Husband's Rout. 'Tis but to catch the Lover by Consent, Cast him at Law, and Spouse has full Content. Make but the Attorney once his Undertaker, Then twelve fat Cuckolds souse the Cuckold-maker. Thus while the Lover for his peeping pays, Good Madam brings home Meat whene'ere she strays; Then Back to Back the happy-dear ones lie, And dreamâof mutual Infidelity. Now, tho' when wrong'd, we make but little pother, 'Tis for both Parties easier much than t'other. What cou'd our Author mean, to shew a Wife So furious, for a common Case in Life! Could be suppose 'twould mend this modish Age, To draw down Terrors from the Greecian Stage! As well our zealous Justices might try To scourge old Drury into Chastity! Yet, we must own Both right i'th'Resolution, To put good wholesome Laws in Execution. And if mad Miss, nor Spouse will mend their Lives, Turn loose the Lawsâand Vengeance of their Wives.</field>
