      <field name="fulltext">To his worthy friend Mr. Philip Massinger, vpon his TragÃ¦comÃ¦die stiled, The Picture. Methinges I heere some busy Criticke say Who's this that singly vshers on this Play? 'Tis boldnes I confesse, and yet perchance It may be constur'd loue, not arrogance. I do not heere vpon this leafe intrude By praysing one, to wrong a multitude. Nor do I thinke that all are tyed to be (Forc'd by my vote) in the same creed with me. Each man hath liberty to iudge; free will, At his owne pleasure to speake good, or ill. But yet your Muse alreadie's knowne so well Her worth will hardly find an infidell. Heere she hath drawne a picture, which shall lye Safe for all future times to practisse by. What ere shall follow are but Coppies, some Preceding workes were types of this to come. 'Tis your owne liuely image, and setts forth When we are dust the beauty of your worth. He that shall dully read and not aduance Ought that is heere betrayes his ignorance. Yet whosoeuer beyond desert commends Errs more by much then he that reprehends, For prayse misplac'd, and honor set vpon A worthlesse subiect is detraction. I cannot sin so heere vnlesse I went About, to stile you only excellent. Apollo's guifts are not confind alone To your dispose, He hath more heires then one, And such as do deriue from this blest hand A large inheritance in the Poets land As well as you, nor are you I assure My selfe so enuious, but you can endure To heere their praise, whose worth long since was knowne And Iustly to, prefer'd before your owne. I know yon would take it for an iniury, (And 'tis a well becomming modesty) To be paraleld with Beaumont, or to heare Your name by some to partiall friend write neere Vnequal'd Ionson: being men whose fire At distance and with reuerence you admir'd. Do so and you shall find your gaine will bee Much more by yeelding them prioritie Then with a certainety of losse to hould A foolish competition; Tis to bould. A tasque, and to be shunde, nor shall my prayse With to much waight ruine, what it would rayse. Thomas Iay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PICTVRE, A true Hungarian History. Actus primi Scena prima. Enter Mathias in armour, Sophia in a riding sute, Corisca, Hilario with other seruants. Mathias. Since we must part Sophia, to passe further. Is not alone impertinent but dangerous. We are not distant from the Turkesh campe Aboue fiue leagues, and who knowes but some partie Of his Timariots that scoure the countrey May fall vpon vs, be now as thy name Truely interpreted hath euer spoke thee, Wise, and discreete, and to thy vnderstanding Marrie thy constant pacience. Sophia. Yow put me Sir, To the vtmost triall of it. Mathias, Nay noe melting, Since the necessity that now seperates vs, We haue long since disputed, and the reasons Forcing me to it, too oft wash'd in teares, I grant that you in birth were farre aboue mee, And great men my superiours riualls for you, But mutuall consent of heart, as hands Ioynde by true loue hath made vs one, and equall; Nor is it in me meere desire of fame, Or to be cride vp by the publike voyce For a braue souldier that puts on my armour, Such aerie tumours take not me you know How narrow our demeanes are, and whats more Hauing as yet no charge of children on vs We hardly can subsist. Sophia. In you alone sir I haue all abundance. Mathias. For my minds content In your owne language I could answere you You haue beene an obedient wise, a right one, And to my power, though short of your desert I haue beene euer an indulgent husband. we haue long inioyd the sweets of loue, and though Not to satisfie, or lothing, yet We must not liue such dotardes on our pleasures As still to hugge them to the certaine losse Of profit, and preferment, competent meanes Maintaines aquiet bed, want breeds dissention Euen in good women. Sophia. Haue you found in me sir Any distast, or signe of discontent For want of whats superfiuous? Mathias, No Sophia. Nor shalt thou euer haue cause to repent Thy constant course in goodnes if heauen blesse My honest vndertakings: 'tis for thee That I turne souldier, and put forth deerest Vpon this sea of action as a factor To trade for rich materialls to adorne Thy noble parts, and show'em in full lustre. I blush that other ladies lesse in beauty And outward forme, but in the harmonie Of the soules rauishing musicke the same age Not to be nam'd with thee, should so out shine thee In iewels, and variety of wardrobes, While you (to whose sweet innocence both Indies Compar'd are of no value) wanting these Passe vnregarded. Sophia. If I am so rich or In your opinion, why should you borrow Additions for me? Mathias. Why? I should be censur'd Of ignorance possessing such a Iewell Aboue all price, if I forbeare to giue it The best of ornaments. Therefore Sophia In few words know my pleasure and obey me, As you haue euer done to your discretion, I leaue the gouernment of my family And our poore fortunes, and from these command Obedienoe to you as to my selfe, To the vtmost of what's mine liue plentifully, And ere the remnant of our store be spent, With my good sword I hope I shall reape for you A haruest in such full abundance, as Shall make a merry winter. Sophia. Since you are not To be diuerted Sir from what you purpose All arguments to stay you heere are vselesse. Goe when you please Sir, Eyes I charge you waste not One drop of sorrow, looke you hoord all vp Till in my widdowed bed I call vpon you, But then be sure you faile not. You blest Angels Guardians of humanelife, I at this instant Forbeare t'inuoke you, at our parting 'twere To personate deuotion. My soule Shall goe along with you, and when you are Circl'd with death and horrour seeke and finde you: And then I will not leaue a Saint vnsu'd to For your protection. To tell you what I will doe in your absence, would shew poorely, My actions shall speake me, 'twere to doubt you To begge I may heere from you, where you are, You cannot liue obscure nor shall one post By night, or day passe vnexamined by me. If I dwell long vpon your lips, consider After this feast the griping fast that followes And it will be excusable, pray turne from mee. All that I can is spoken. Exit Sophia. Mathias. Follow your mistersse. Forbeare your wishes for me, let mee finde'em, At my returne in your prompt will to serue her. Hilario. For my part sir I will grow leane with study To make her merry. Corisca. Though you are my Lord, Yet being her gentlewoman, by my place I may take my leaue, your hand or if you please To haue me fight so high, ile not be coy But stande a tiptoe for't; Mathias. O farewell gyrle. Hilario. A kisse well begg'd Corisca, Corisca. Twas my fee, Loue how he melts! I cannot blame my ladies Vnwillingnesse to part with such marmulade lips. There will be scrambling for'em in the campe, And were it not for my honesty I could wish now I were his leager landresse I would finde Sope of mine owne, enough to wash his linnen Or I would straine hard for't Hilario. How the mammet'twitters! Come, come my ladie staies for vs. Corisca. Would I had beene Her ladiship the last night. Hilario. Noe more of that wench. Exunt Hilario. Mathias. I am strangely troubled: yet why I should nourish A furie heere, and with imagind foode. Hauing no reall grounds on which to raise, A buildings of suspition, she was euer Or can be false heereafter I in this But foolishly inquire the knowledge of A future sorrow, which if I find out, My present ignorance were a cheape purchase Though with my losse of beeing, I haue already Dealt with a friend of mine, a generall scholler One deepely read in natures hidden secrets, And though with much vnwillingnesse haue wone him To doe as much as Art can to resolue me My fate that followes to my wish, Hee's come. Enter Baptista. Iulio Baptista, now I may affirme Your promise, and performance walke together. And therefore without circumstance to the point, Instruct me what I am. Baptista. I could wish you had Made triall of my loue some other way. Mathias. Nay this is from the purpose. Baptista. If you can, Proportion your desire to any meane I do pronounce you happy I haue found By certaine rules of Art your matchlesse wife Is to this present hower from all pollution Free and vntainted. Mathias. Good. Baptista. In reason therefore You should fixe heere, and make no farther serach Of what may fall heereafter. Mathias. O Baptista Tis not in me to master so my passions, I must know farther, or you haue made good But halfe your promise while my loue stood by, Holding her vpright, and my presence was A watch vpon her; her desires being met to with equall ardor from me; what one proofe Could she giue of her constancy being vntempted? But when I am absent, and my comming backe Vncertaine, and those wanton heates in women Not to be quench'd by lawfull meanes, and shee The absolute disposer of her selfe, Without, controule, or curbe nay more inuited By opportunity and all strong temptations It then she hold out. Baptista. As no doubt she will, Mathias. Those doubts must be made certainties Baptista By your assurance, or your boasted Art Deserues no admiration, how you trifle And play with my affliction? I am on The wracke till you confirme mee. Baptista. Sure Mathias. I am no God, nor can I diue into Her hidden thoughts, or know what her intents are That is deni'd to art, and kept conceald euen from the diuels themselues: they can but guesse Out of long obseruation what is likely, But positiuely to foretell that this shall be You may conclude impossible, all I can I will doe for you when you are distant from her A thousand leauges as if you then were with her You shall know truly when she is solicited, And how far wrought on. Mathias. I desire no more. Baptista. Take then this little modell of Sophia With more then humane skill limde to the life Each line, and lenament of it in the drawing Soe punctually obserued that had it motion In so much'twere her selfe. Mathias, It is indeede An admirable peece, but if it haue not Some hidden vertue that I cannot guesse at In what can it aduantage me? Baptista. Ile instruct you, Carry it still about you and as oft As you desire to know how shee's affected With curious eyes peruse it while it keepes The figure it now has intire, and perfit She is not onely innocent in fact But vnattempted: but if once it varie From the true forme, and what's now white, and red Incline to yellow rest most confident Shees with all violence courted but vnconquerd. But if it turne all blacke 'tis an assurance The fort by composition, or surprize Is forc'd or with her free consent surrenderd. Mathias. How much you haue ingag'd me for this fauour, The seruice of my whole life shall make good Baptista. We will not part so, Ile along with you And it is needfull with the rising Sun The armies meete yet ere the fight begun In spite of oposition I will place you In the head of the Hungarian Generals troope And neere his person. Mathias. As my better Angel You shall direct and guide mee. Baptista. As we ride Ile tell you more. Mathias. In all things Ile obey you. Exeunt. scÃ¦na secunda, Enter Vbaldo, Ricardo. Ricardo. When came the post? Vbaldo. The last night. Ricardo. From the campe? Vbaldo. Yes as 'tis said, and the letter writ and signd By the generall Ferdinand Ricardo. Nay then sans question It is of moment. Vbaldo. It concernes the liues Of two great armies, Ricardo. Was it cherfully Receiued by the King? Vbaldo. Yes, for being assured The armies were in view of one another Hauing proclaimed a publicke fast, and prayer For the good successe, dispatch'd a gentleman Of his priuy chamber to the generall With absolute authority from him To trie the fortune of a day. Ricardo. No doubt then The Generall will come on and fight it brauely, Heauen Prosper him, this militarie art I grant to be the noblest of professions And yet I thanke my stars fort I was neuer Inclin'd to learne it, since this bubble honour, (Which is indeede the nothing souldiers fight for With the losse of limbes, or life) is in my iudgement Too deare a purchase. Vbaldo. Giue me our Court-warfare, The danger is not great in the encounter Of a faire Mistresse. Ricardo. Faire and sound together Doe very well Vbaldo. But such are With difficulty to be found out, and whe they know Their value prizde too high. By thy owne report Thou wast at twelue a gamester, and since that Studied all kinds of females, from the night-trader I'the streete with certaine danger to thy pocket, To the great Lady in her Cabinet, That spent vpon thee more in cullises To strengthen thy weake backe, then would maintaine Twelue Flanders mares, and as many running horses: Besides Apothecaries and Chirurgeons bills Payd vpon all occasions, and those frequent. Vbaldo. You talke Ricardo, as if yet you were A nouice in those misteries. Ricardo. By no meanes, My Doctor can assure the contrary, I loose no time. I haue felt the paine and pleasure As he that is a gamester, and playes often Must sometimes be a looser. Ubaldo. Wherefore then Doe you enuy me? Ricardo. It growes not from my want, Nor thy abundance, but being as I am The likelier man, and of much more experience, My good parts, are my cursies, there's no beauty But yeeldes ere it be summon'd, and as nature Had sign'd me the monopolie of maidenheads, There's none can buy till I haue made my market, Satiety cloyes me, as I liue I would part with Halfe my estate, nay trauaile ore the world To finde that onely PhÃ¦nix in my search That could hold out against me. Ubaldo. Be not rapp'd so: You may spare that labour, as she is a woman What thinke you of the Queene? Ricardo. I dare not aime at The petticoate royall, that is still excepted: Yet were she not my Kings, being the abstract Of all that's rare, or to be wish'd in woman, To write her in my catalogue, hauing inioy'd her I would venter my necke to a halter, but we talke of Impossibilities, as she hath a beauty Would make old Nestor young, such maiesty Drawes foorth a sword of terrour to defend it, As would fright Paris, though the Queene of loue Vow'd her best furtherance to him. Ubaldo. Haue you obseru'd The grauity of her language mix'd with sweetnesse? Ricardo. Then at what distance she reserues her selfe When the King himselfe makes his approaches to her, Ubaldo. As she were still a virgine, and his life But one continued wooing. Ricardo. She well knowes Her worth, and values it. Ubaldo. And so farre the King is Indulgent to her humors, that he forbeares The duety of a husband, bxt when she calles for't. Ricardo. All his imaginations and thoughts Are buried in her, the lowd noyse of warre Cannot awake him. Ubaldo. At this very instant. When both his life and Crowne are at the stake, He onely studies her content, and when She's pleas'd to shew her selfe, musicke and masques Are with all care and cost prouided for her. Ricardo. This night she promis'd to appeare. Ubaldo. You may heleeue it by the diligence of the King As if he were her harbinger. Enter Ladislaus, Eubulus, and attendants with perfumes. Ladislaus. These roomes Are not perfum'd as we directed. Eubulus. Not Sir, I know not what you would haue, I am sure the smoke Cost treble the price of the whole weekes prouision Spent in your Maiesties kitchins. Ladislaus. How! I scorne Thy grosse comparison. When my Honoria Th'amazement of the present time, and enuy Of all succeeding ages does descend To sanctifie a place, and in her presence Makes it a Temple to me, can I be Too curious, much lesse prodigall to receiue her? But that the splendour of her beames of beauty Hath strucke thee blinde? Eubulus. As dotage hath done yon. Ladislaus. Dotage, O blasphemy! is it in me To serue her to her merit? is she not The daughter of a King? Eubulus. And you the sonne Of ours I take it, by what priuiledge else Doe you reigne ouer vs? for my part I know not Where the dispairity lyes. Ladislaus. Her birth old man, Old in the Kingdomes seruice which protects thee, Is the least grace in her: and though her beauties Might make the thunderer a riuall for her, They are but superficiall ornaments And faintly speake her, from her heauenly mind Were all antiquity and fiction lost Our moderne Poets could not in their fancie But fashion a Minerua farre transcending Th'imagin'd one, whom Homer onely dreamt of, But then adde this, she's mine, mine Eubulus. And though she know one glance from her faire eyes Must make all gazers her idolaters, Shee is so sparing of their influence That to shunsuperstition in others, Shee shootes her powerfull beames onely at me. And can I then, whom she desires to hold Her Kingly captiue aboue all the world, Whose Nations and Empires if she pleas'd Shee might command as slaues, but gladly pay The humble tribute of my loue and seruice, Nay if I sayd of adoration to her I did not erre? Eubulus. Well, since you hugge your fetters In loues name weare'em. You are a King, and that Concludes you wise. Your will a powerfull reason, Which we that are foolish Subiects must not argue. And what in a meane man I should call folly, Is in your Maiesty remarkable wisedome. But for me I subscribe. Ladislaus. Doe, and loooke vp: Vpon this wonder. Lowd musicke, Honoria in state vnder a Canopy, her traine borne vp by Siluia and Acanthe. Ricardo. Wonder? it is more Sir. Vbaldo. A rapture, an astonishment. Ricardo. What thinke you Sir? Eubulus. As the King thinkes, that is the surest guard We Courtiers euer lie at. Was Prince euer So drownd in dotage? Without spectacles I can see a hansome woman, and she is so: But yet to admiration looke not on her. Heauen how he fawnes; and as it were his duty, With what assured grauity she receiues it! Her hand againe! O she at length vouchsafes Her Lip, and as he had suck'd Nectar from it How he's exalted! Women in their natures Affect command, but this humility In a husband and a King markes her the way To absolute tyranie. So, Inno's plac'd In loues Tribunall, and like Mercurie Forgetting his owne greatnesse, he attends For her imployments. She prepares to speake, What Oracles shall we heare now? Honoria. That you please Sir, With such assurances of loue and fauour, To grace your handmaid, but in being yours Sir, A matchlesse Queene, and one that knowes herselfe so, Bindes me in retribution to deserue The grace conferd vpon me. Ladislaus. You transcend In all things excellent, and it is my glory, Your worth weigh'd truly to depose my selfe From absolute command, surrendring vp My will and faculties to your disposure: And heere I vow, not for a day or yeere, But my whole life, which I wish long to serue you: That whatsoeuer I in iustice may Exact from these my subiects, you from me May boldly challenge. And when you require it, In signe of my subiection, as your vassall, Thus I will pay my homage. Honoria. O forbeare Sir, Let not my Lips enuie my Robe: on them Print your alegiance often. I desire No other fealtie. Ladislaus. Gracious Soueraigne, Boundlesse in bounty! Eubulus. Is not heere fine fooling? He's questionlesse bewitch'd. would I were gelt So that would disenchant him. Though I forfeit My life for it I must speake. By your good leaue sir, I haue no sute to you, nor can you grant one Hauing no Power. You are like me a subiect. Her more then serene Maiesty being present. And I must tell you, 'tis ill manners in you, Hauing depos'd your selfe to keepe your hat on, And not stand bare as we doe, being no King, But a fellow subiect with vs. Gentlemen vshers It does belong to your place, see it reform'd, He has giuen his Crowne, and cannot challenge The priuiledge of his bonnet. Ladislaus. Doe no tempt me. Eubulus. Tempt you, in what? in following your example If you are angry question me heereafter, As Ladislaus should do Eubulus On equall termes, you were of late my soueraigne But weary of it, I now bend my knee To her diuinity, and desire a boone From her more then magnificence. Honoria. Take it freely. Nay be not mou'd, for our mirth sake let vs heare him, Eubulus, 'Tis but to aske a question, haue you ne're read The story of Semiramis and Ninus? Honoria. Not as I remember. Eubulus. I will then instruct you, And tis to the purpose, this Ninus was a King, And such an impotent louing King as this was But now hee's none, this Ninus (pray you obserue me) Doted on this Semiramis, a smiths wife, (I must confesse there the comparison holdes not, You are a Kings daughter, yet vnder your correction Like her a woman) this Assirian monarch (Of whom this is a patterne) to expresse His loue, and seruice, seated her as you are, In his regall throne, and bound by oth his Nobles For getting all alleageance to himselfe One day to be her subiects, and to put In execution what euer shee Pleas'd to impose vpon 'em, pray you command him To minister the like to vs and then You shall heare what follow'd. Ladislaus. Well sir to your story. Eubulus. You haue no warrant, stand by, Let me know Your pleasure Goddesse. Honoria. Let this nod assure you. Eubulus. Goddesse like indeede, as I liue a pretty Idoll, She knowing her power wisely made vse of it And fearing his inconstancy, and repentance Of what he had granted (as in reason Madam, Yo may doe his) that hee might neuer haue Power to recall his grant, or question her For her short gouernment, instantly gaue order To haue his head strucke off. Ladislaus. I'st possible? Eubulus. The story sayes so and commends her wisedome For making vse of her authority: And it is worth your imitation Madam, He loues subiection, and you are no Queene Vnlesse you make him feele the waight of it. You are more then all the world to him, and that, He may be foe to you, and not seeke change, When his delights are sated, mew him vp In some close prison, if you let him liue (Which is no policy) and there dyet him As you thinke fit to feede your appetite Since there ends his ambition. Ubaldo. Diuelish counsaile. Ricardo. The King's amaz'd. Vbaldo. The Queene appeares too full Of deepe imaginations, Eubulus Hath put both to it. Ricardo. Now she seemes resolu'd I long to know the issue. Honoria descends. Honoria. Giue me leaue, Deare sir to reprehend you for appearing Perplex'd with what this old man out of enuy Of your vnequal'd graces showr'd vpon me, Hath in his fabulous story sawcily Applide to me, sir that you onely nourish One doubt Honoria dares abuse the power With which shee is inuested by your fauour, Or that she euer can make vse of it To the iniury of you the great bestower, Takes from your iudgement, it was your delight To seeke to me with more obsequiousnesse, Then I desir'd. And stood it with my duety Not to receiue what you were pleas'd to offer? I doe but act the Part you put vpon me, And though you make me Personate a Queene, And you my subiect, when the play your pleasure Is at a period, I am what I was Before I enter'd, still your humble wife, And you my royall Soueraigne. Ricardo. Admirable! Honoria. I haue heard of Captains taken more with danger Then the rewards, and if in your approches To those delights which are your owne, and freely To heighten your desire, you make the passage Narrow and difficult, shall I prescribe you? Or blame your fondnesse? Or can that swell me Beyond my iust proportion? Ubaldo. Aboue wonder! Ladisluus. Heauen make me thankefull for such goodnesse. Honoria. Now Sir, The state I tooke to satisfie your pleasure I change to this humility, and the oath You made to me of homage, I thus cancell, And seate you in your owne. Ladisluus. I am transported Beyond my selfe. Honoria. And now to your wise Lordship, Am I prou'd a Semiramis? or hath My Ninus, as maliciously you made him, Cause to repent th'excesse of fauour to me, Which you call dotage? Ladisluus. Answere wretch. Eubulus. I dare Sir, And say how euer the euent may pleade In your defence, you had a guilty cause; Nor was it wisedome in you (I repeate it) To teach a Lady, humble in her selfe With the ridiculous dotage of a louer To be ambitious. Honoria. Eubulus, I am so, Tis rooted in me, you mistake my temper. I do professe my selfe to be the most Ambitious of my sex, but not to hould Command ouer my Lord, such a proud torrent Would sincke me in my wishes; not that I Am ignorant how much I can deserue And may with iustice challenge. Eubulus. This I look'd for; After this seeming humble ebbe I knew A gushing tide would follow. Honoria. By my birth, And liberall giftes of nature, as of fortune, From you, as things beneath me, I expect What's due to maiesty, in which I am A sharer with your soueraigne. Eubulus. Good againe! Honoria. And as I am most eminent in place, In all my actions I would appeere so. Ladislaus. You need not feare a riuall. Honoria. I hope not; And till finde one, I disdaine to know What enuie is. Ladislaus. You are aboue it Madam. Honoria. For beauty without art, discourse, and free From affectation, with what graces else Can in the wife and daughter of a King Be wish'd, I dare prefer my selfe. Eubulus. As I Blush for you lady, trumpet your owne prayses? This spoken by the people had beene heard With honour to you; does the court afford No oyle-tongu'd parasite, that you are forc'd To be your owne grosse flatterer? Ladislaus. Bee dumbe, Thou spirit of contradiction. Honoria. The wolfe But barkes against the Moone, and I contemne it. The masque you promis'd. A horne. Enter a Post. Ladislaus. Let'em enter. How! Eubulus. Heere's one, I feare vnlook'd for. Ladislaus. From the Campe? Post. The Generall victorious in your fortune, Kisses your hand in this Sir. Ladislaus. That great Power, Who at his pleasure does dispose of battailes, Be euer prais'd for't. Read sweet, and pertake it: The Turke is vanquish'd, and with little losse Vpon our part, in which our ioy is doubl'd. Eubulus. But let it not exalt you, beare it Sir With moderation, and pay what you owe for't. Ladislaus. I vnderstand thee Eubulus. Ile not now Enquire particulars. Our delights deferr'd, With reuerence to the Temples, there wee'l tender Our Soules deuotions to his dread might, Who edg'd our swords, and taught vs how to fight. Exeunt omnes. The end of the first Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundi ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Hilario, Corisca. Hilario. You like my speech? Corisca. Yes, if you giue it action In the deliuerie. Hilario. If? I pitty you. I haue plaide the foole before, this is not the first time, Nor shall be I hope the last. Corisca. Nay I thinke so to. Hila. And if I put her not out of her dumps with laughter, Ile make her howle for anger. Corisca. Not too much Of that good fellow Hilario. Our sad Lady Hath dranke too often of that bitter cup, A pleasant one must restore her. With what patience Would she indure to heare of the death of my Lord, That meerely out of doubt he may miscary Afflicts her selfe thus? Hilario. Vm, 'tis a question A widdow onely can resolue. There be some That in their husbands sicknesses haue wep'd Their pottle of teares a day: but being once certaine At midnight he was dead, haue in the morning Dri'd vp their handkerchers, and thought no more on't. Corisca. Tush, shee is none of that race, if her sorrow Be not true and perfit, I against my sex Will take my oath woman nere wep'd in earnest. She has made her selfe a prisoner to her chamber, Darke as a dungeon, in which no beame Of comfort enters. She admits no visits; Eares little, and her nightly musicke is Of sighes and groanes tun'd to such harmonie Of feeling greefe, that I against my nature Am made one of the consort. This houre onely She takes the aire, a custome euery day She sollemnly obserues, with greedy hopes From some that passe by to receiue assurance Of the successe, and safety of her Lord: Now if that your deuice will take Hilario. Nere feare it: I am prouided cap a pe, and haue My properties in readinesse. Sophia within. Bring my vaile there. Corisca. Be gone, I heare her comming. Hilario. If I doe not Appeare, and what's more, appeare perfit, hisse me. Exit Hilario. Enter Sophia. Sophia. I was flatter'd once I was a Star, but now Turn'd a prodigious meteor, and like one Hang in the aire betweene my hopes, and feares, And euery howre the little stuffe burnt out That yeelds a waning light to dying comfort, I doe expect my fall and certaine ruine. In wretched things more wretched is delay, And hope a parasite to me, being vnmasqu'd Appeares more horrid then despaire, and my Distraction worse then madnesse: eu'n my prayers When with most zeale sent vpward, are pull'd downe, With strong imaginary doubts and feares, And in their suddaine precipice orewhelme me. Dreames, and phantastick evisions walke the round About my widdowed bed, and euery slumber Broken with lowd alarms: can these be then But sad presages girle? Corisca. You mak 'em so, And antedate a losse shall ne're fall on you. Such pure affection, such mutuall loue, A bed, and vndefil'd on either part, A house without contention, in two bodies One will, and Soule like to the rod of concord, Kissing each other, cannot be short liu'd Or end in barrennesse: if all these deare Madam (Sweet in your sadnesse) should produce no fruite, Or leaue the age no models of your selues, To witnesse to posterity what you were Succeeding times frighted with the example But hearing of your story, would instruct Their fairest issue to meete sensually, Like other creatures, and forbeare to raise True loue, or Himen Altars. Sophia. O Corisca, I know thy reasons are like to thy wishes, And they are built vpon a weake foundation, To raise me comfort. Ten long dayes are past, Ten long dayes my Corisca, since my Lord Embarqu'd himselfe vpon a Sea of danger, In his deare care of me. And if his life Had not beene ship wrack'd on the rocke of war, His tendernesse of me (knowing how much I languish for his absence) had prouided Some trusty friend from wohm I might receiue Assurance of his safety. Corisca. Ill newes Madam, Are swallow-wing'd, but what's good walkes on crutches: With patience expect it, and ere long No doubt you shall heare from him. A sowgelders horne blowne. A Post. Sophia. Ha! What's that? Corisca. The foole has got a sowgelders horne As I take it Madam. Sophia. It makes this way still, Neerer and neerer. Corisca. From the Campe I hope. Enter Hilario, with a long white hayre and beard, in an anticke armour, one with a horne before him. Sophia. The messenger appeares, and in strange armour. Heauen if it be thy will! Hilario. It is no boote To striue, our horses tir'd let's walke on foot, And that the Castle which is very neere vs, To giue vs entertainment may soone heare vs, Blow lustily my Lad, and drawing nigh a, Aske for a Lady which is clep'd Sophia. Corisca. He names you Madam. Hilario. For to her I bring, Thus clad in in armes, newes of a pretty thing, By name Mathias. Sophia. From my Lord? O Sir, I am Sophia, that Mathias wife. So may Mars fauour you in all your battailes, As you with speede vnloade me of the burthen I labour vnder, till I am confirm'd Both where, and how you left him. Hilario. If thou art As I beleeue, the pigs-ney of his heart, Know hee's in health, and what's more full of glee, And so much I was will'd to say to thee. Sophia. Haue you no letters from him? Hilario. No more words. In the Campe we vse no pens, but write with swords: Yet as I am inioyn'd, by word of mouth I will proclaime his deeds from North to South. But tremble not while I relate the wonder, Though my eyes like lightning shine, and my voyce thunder. Sophia. This is some counterfeit bragart. Corisca. Heare him Madam. Hila. The Reere march'd first, which follow'd by the Van, And wing'd with the Battalia, no man Durst stay to shift a shirt or louze himselfe; Yet ere the armies ioyn'd, that hopefull elfe, Thy deere my dainty duckling, bold Mathias Aduanc'd, and star'd like Hercules or Golias. A hundred thousand Turkes, it is no vaunt, Assail'd him, euery one a Termagaunt, But what did he then? with his keene edge speare He cut, and Carbonadode 'em, heere, and there, Lay leggs and armes, and as 'tis sayd truely Of Beuis, some he quarter'd all in three. Sophia. This is ridiculous. Hilario. I must take breath Then like a Nightingale i'le sing his death; Sophia. His death? Hilario. I am out. Corisca. Recouer dunder-head. Hilario. How he escap'd I should haue sung, not dide For, though a knight, when I said so I lide Weary he was, and scarse could stand vpright And looking round for some couragious Knight To reskue him, as one perplex'd in woe He cald to me, helpe, helpe Hilario, My valiant seruant helpe. Corisca. He has spoyld all. Sophia. Are you the man of armes then? ile make bold To take of your martiall beard, you had fooles hayre Enough without it. Slaue, how durst thou make Thy sport of what concernes me more then life, In such an anticke fashion? am I growne Contemptible to those I feed? you mignion Had a hand in it to, as it appeares, Your petticote serues for bases to this warrior. Corisca. We did it for your mirth. Hilario. For my selfe I hope, I haue spoke like a souldier. Sophia. Hence you rascall. I neuer but with reuerence name my Lord And can I heere it by thy tongue prophain'd And not correct thy folly? but you are Transform'd, and turnd Knight errant, take your course And wander where you please, for heere I vow By my Lords life (an oath I will not breake) Till his returne, or certainty of his safety, My doores are shut against thee. Exit Sophia. Corisca. You haue made A fine peece of worke on't: how do you like the quality? You had a foolish itch to be an actor, And may strowle where you please. Hilario. Will you buy my share? Corisca. No certainely, I feare I haue already Too much of mine owne, I'le onely as a damsell (As the bookes say) thus far helpe to disarme you, And so deere Don Quixote taking my leaue, I leaue you to your fortune. Exit Corisca. Hilario. Haue I sweate My braines out for this quaint and rare inuention, And am I thus rewarded? I could turne? TragÅdian, and rore now, but that I feare 'Twould get me too great a stomacke hauing no meat To pacifie Colon, what will become of me? I cannot begge in armor, and steale I dare not: My end must bee to stand in a corne feild And fright away the crowes for bread, and cheese, Or finde some hollow tree in the high way, And there vntill my Lord returne sell switches No more Hilario, but Dolorio now. Ile weepe my eyes out, and bee blind of purpose To moue compassion, and so I vanish, Exit Hilario. ScÃ¦na secunda. Enter Eubulus, Vbaldo, Ricardo, and others. Eubulus. Are the gentlemen sent before as it was order'd By the Kings direction to entertaine The Generall? Ricardo. Long since, they by this haue met him, And giu'n him the beinvenue. Eubulus. I hope I neede not Instruct you in your parts. Vbaldo. How! vs my Lord! Feare not, we know our distances and degrees To the very inch where we are to salute him. Ricardo. The state were miserable if the Court had none Of her owne breede, familiar with all garbes. Gracious in England, Italie, Spaine or France, With forme, and punctuallity to receiue Sranger Embassadours. For the Generall Hee's a meere natiue, and it matters not Which way we doe accost him. Vbaldo. 'Tis great pitty That such as sit at the helme prouide no better For the tiraning vp of the Gentry. In my iudgement An Academie erected, with large pensions To such as in a table could set downe The congees, cringes, postures, methods, phrase, Proper to euery Nation. Ricardo. O it were An admirable piece of worke! Vbaldo. And yet rich fooles Throw away their charity on Hospitals For beggers, and lame souldiers, and nere study The due regard to complement and court-ship, Matters of more import, and are indeed The glories of a Monarchie. Eubulus. These no doubt Are state, points, gallants, I confesse, but sure, Our court needs no aydes this way, since it is A schoole of nothing else: there are some of you Whom I forbeare to name, whose coyning heads Are the mints of all new fashions, that haue donne More hurt to the Kingdome by superfluous brauerie Which the foolish gentry imitate then a war Or a long famine, all the treasure by This soule excesse, is got into the marchants, Embroiderers, silkemans, Iewellers, Taylors hand, And the third part of the land to, the nobility Ingrossing titles onely. Ricardo. My lord you are bitter. Enter a seruant. a trumpet, Ser. the Generall is alighted, and now entred. Ricardo. Were he ten Generals I am prepard And know what I will doe. Eubulus. Pray you what Ricardo? Ricardo. Ile fight at complement with him. Ubaldo. Ile charge home to. Eubulus. And thats a desperate seruice if you come off well. Enter Ferdinand, Mathias, Baptista, two captaines. Ferdinand. Captaine command the officers to keepe The souldier as he march'd in ranke and file Till they heare farther from me. Eubulus. Heer's one speakes In another keye, this is no canting language Taught in your Academie. Ferdinand. Nay I will present you To the King my selfe. Mathias. A grace beyond my merit, Ferdinand. You vndervalew what I cannot set Too high a price on, Eubulus. With a friends true heart I gratulate your returne. Ferdinando: Next to the fauour Of the great King I am happy in your friendship: Ubaldo. By courtship, course on both sides, Ferdinando. pray you receiue This stranger to your knowledge, on my credit At all parts hee deserues it. Eubulus. Your report Is a strong assurance to mee, sir most welcome Mathias. This sayd by you, the reuerence of your age Commands mee to beleeue it. Ricardo. this was pretty. But second mee now, I cannot stoope too lowe To doe your excellence that due obseruance Your fortune claimes. Eubulus. Hee nere thinks on his vertue. Ricardo. For beeing, as you are, the soule of souldiers, And bulwarke of Bellona, Vbaldo. The protection Both of the court and King. Ricardo. and the sole mignion Of mighty Mars Ubaldo. One that with iustice may Increase the number of the worthies. Eubulus. hoye day. Ricardo. It beeing impossible in my armes to circle Such giant worth. Ubaldo. At distance wee presume To kisse your honored gauntlet. Eubulus. What replie now Can he make to this fopperie? Ferdinand. You haue sayd Gallants, so much, and hitherto done soe little, That 't ill I learne to speake, and you to doe I must take time to thanke you. Eubulus. As I liue Answer'd as I could wish. How the fops gape now! Ricardo. This was harsh, and scuruie. Vbaldo. We will be reueng'd When he comes to court the ladies, and laugh at him. Eubulus. Nay doe your offices gentlemen, and conduct The Generall to the presence. Ricardo. Keepe your order. Ubaldo. Make way for the Generall. Exeunt omnes prÃ¦ter Eubulum. Eubulus. What wise man That with iudicious eyes lookes one a souldier But must confesse that fortunes swinge is more Ore that profession, then all kinds else Of life pursu'd by man, they in a state Are but as chirurgions to wounded men Euen desperate in their hopes, while paine and anguish Make them blaspheme, and call in vaine for death; Their wiues and children kisse the chirurgions knees Promise him mountaines, if his sauing hand Restore the tortur'd wretch to former strength. But when grimme death by Ãsculapius art Is frighted from the house, and health appeares In sanguin colours on the sicke mansface, All is forgot, and asking his reward Hee's payd with curses, often receaues wounds From him whose woundes hee curde, so souldiers Though of more worth and vse, meete the same fate, As it is too apparent. I haue obseru'd In one hue. When horrid Mars the touch of whose rough hand With Palsies shakes a kingdome, hath put on His dreadfull Helmet, and with terror fills The place where helike an vnwelcome guest Resolue to reuell, how the Lords of her, like The tradesman, marchant, and litigious pleader (And such like Scarabes bred'ith dung of peace) In hope of their protection humbly offer Their daughters to their beds, heyres to their seruice, And wash with teares, their sweate their dust, their scars, But when those clouds of war that menaced A bloudy deluge to th'affrighted state, Are by their breath dispers'd, and ouer blowne, And famine, bloud, and death Bellona's pages Whip'd from the quiet continent to Thrace Souldiers, that like the foolish hedge sparrow To their owne ruine hatch this Cucckow peace, Are straight thought burdensome, Since want of meanes Growing from want of action breedes contempt, And that the worst of ills fall to their lot Their seruice with the danger soone forgot. Enter a seruant. Ser. The Queene, my Lord, hath made choyce of this roome. To see the masque. Eubulus. Ile be looker on My dancing dayes are past. Loud musicke as they passe, a song in the praise of war, Vbaldo, Ricardo, Ladislaus. Ferdin. and Honoriu, Mathias, Silua, Acanthe, Baptista, and others. Ladislaus. This courtesie To a stranger My Honoria, keepe faire ranke With all your rarities, after your trauaile Looke on our court delights; but first from your Relation, with erected eares i'll heare The musicke of your war which must be sweet Ending in victory. Ferdinand Not to trouble Your maiesties with description of a battaile To full of horror for the place, and to Avoyd perticulers which I should deliuer I must trench longer on your pacience then My manner will gieue way to, in a word sir It was well fought on both sides, and almost With equall fortune, it continuing doubtfull Vpon whose tents plum'd victory would take Her glorious stands, impatient of delay With the flower of our prime gentlemen I charg'd Their maine Bartalia, and with their assistance Brake in, but when I was almost assur'd That they were routed, by a Stratagem Of the subtill Turke, who opening his grosse body, And ralyng vp his troopes on either side, I found my selfe so far ingag'd (for I Must not conceale my errors) that I knew not Which way with honor to come off. Eubulus. I like A Generall that tells his faults, and is not Ambitious to ingrosse vnto himselfe All honour as some haue, in which with iustice They could not claime a share. Ferdinand. Being thus hem'd in Their Cimitars rag'd among vs, and my horse Kil'd vnder me, I euery minute look'd for An honourable end, and that was all My hope could fashion to me, circl'd thus With death and horror, as one sent from heauen This man of men with some choise horse that followed His braue example, did pursue the tract His sword cut for'em, and but that I see him, Already blush to heare what he being present, I know would wish vnspoken, I should say sir By what hee did, we bouldly may beleeue All that is writ of Hector. Mathias. Generall Pray spare these strange Hyperboles. Eubulus. Do not blush To heare a truth, heere are a payre of Monsiuers Had they beene in your place would haue run away And nere chang'd countenance. Vbaldo. We haue your good word still. Eubulus. And shall while you deserue it. Ladislaus. Silence, on. Ferdinand. He as I sayd, like dreadfull lightning throwne From Iupiters shield dispersd the armed Gire With which I was enuirond horse and man, Shruncke vnder his strong arme more with his lookes Frighted, the valiant fled with which encourag'd My souldiers (like young Eglets praying vnder The wings of their fierce dame) as if from him They tooke both spirit, and fire brauely came on. By him I was remounted, and inspir'd Wiih trebble courage, and such as fled before Bouldly made head againe, and to confirme 'em It suddainely was apparent, that the fortune Of the day was ours, each souldier and commander Performd his part, but this was the great wheele By which the lesser mou'd, and all rewards And signes of honour, as the Ciuicke garland, The murall wreath, the enemies prime horse, With the Generals sword, and armour (the old honors With which the Roman crowne their seueral leaders) To him alone are proper. Ladislaus. And they shall Deseruedly fall on him, sit, tis our pleasure, Ferdinand. Which I must serue, not argue, Honoria. You are a stranger, But in your seruice for the King, a natiue. And though a free Queene, I am bound in duty To cherish vertue wheresoere I find it: This place is yours. Mathias. It were presumption in me To sit so neere you. Honoria. Not hauing our warrant Ladislaus. Let the masquers enter by the preparation Tis a French brawle, an apish imitation Of what you really performe in battaile, And Pallas bound vp in a little volume Apollo with his lute attending on her Song and dance: Serue for the induction. Enter the two Boyes, one with his lute, the other like Pallas, A song in the prayse of souldiers, especially being victorious: the song ended the King goes on. Song by Pallas. Though we contemplate to expresse The glory of your happinesse, That by your powerfull arme haue binne So true a victor, that no sinne Could euer taint you with a blame To lessen your deserued fame. Or though we contend to set Your worth in the full height, or get Calestiall singers (crownd with bayes With florishes to dresse your praise) You know your conquest, but your story Liues in your triumphant glory. Ladislaus. Our thanks to all To the banquet thats prepard to entertaine 'em, What would my best Honoria? Honoria. May it please My King that I who by his suffrage euer Haue had power to command, may now intreat An honor from him. Ladislaus. Why should you desire What is your owne, what ere it be you are The mistris of it. Honoria. I am happy in Your grant: my sute sir is, that your commanders Especially this stranger, may as I In my discretion shall thinke good, receiue What's due to their deserts. Ladislaus. What you determine Shall know no alteration. Eubulus. The souldier Is like to haue good vsage when he depends Vpon her pleasure? are all the men so bad That to giue satisfaction we must A woman threasourer, heauen helpe all. Honoria. With you sir I will begin, and as in my esteeme You are most eminent expect to haue, What's fit for me to giue, and you to take; The fauour in the quicke dispatch being double Goe fetch my casket, and with speed. Eubulus. The Kingdome Exit Acanthe. Is very bare of mony: when rewards Issue from the Queenes iewell house, giue him gold And store, no question the gentleman wants it. Good Madam what shall he doe with a hoop ring, And a sparke of diamond in it, though you tooke it Enter Acanthe. For the greater honor from your maiesties finger, 'Twill not increase the value. He must purchase Rich suites, the gay comparison of court-shipp, Reuell, and feast, which the war ended is A souldiers glory, and tis fit that way Your bountie should prouide for him Honoria. You are rude, And by your narrow thoughts proportion mine. What I will doe now, shall be worth the enuie Of Cleopatra open it, see heere Honoria descends The Lapidares Idol gold is trash And a poore salarie fit for groomes, weare these As studded stars in your armour, and make the Sun Looke with iealousie of a greater light Then his beames guild the day with: when it is Expos'd to view, call it Honorias guift, The Queene Honorias guift that loues a soulder, And to giue ornament, and lustre to him Parts freely with her owne, yet not to take From the magnificence of the King, I will Dispence his bounty to but as a page To wait on mine, for other tosses take A hundred thousand crownes, your hand deere sir, And this shall be thy warrant. Takes of the Kings signes. Eubulus. I perceiue I was cheated in this woman now she is I th'giruing veine to souldiers, let her be proud And the King dote, soe she goe on, I care not Honoria. This done, our pleasure is that all arrearages Be payd into the Captaines, and their troopes With a large donatiue to increase their Zeale For the seruice of the kingdome. Eubulus. Better still, Let men of armes be vsd thus, if they do not Charge desperately vpon the Cannons mouth Though the Diuell ror'd, and fight like dragons, hang me. Now they may drinke sacke, but small beere, with a pasport To begge with as they trauaile, and no money, Turnes their red blood to buttermilke. Honoria. Are you pleas'd sir With what I haue done? Ladislaus. Yes, and thus confirme it, With this addition of mine owne, you haue sir From our lou'd Queene receaued some recompence For your life hazarded in the late action, And that we may follow her great example In cherishing valor without limit, aske What you from vs can wish Mathias. If it be true, Dread sir as 'tis affirmd, that euery soyle Where he is well, is to a valiant man His naturall country, reason may assure me I should fix heere, where blessings beyond hope From you the spring like riuers flow vnto me. If wealth were my ambition, by the Queene I am made rich already, to the amazment Of all that see, or shall hereafter read The story of her bounty, if to spend The remnant of my life in deedes of armes No 'region is more fertill of good knights from whom my knowledg that way may be beterd Then this your warlike Hungary; if fauour, Or grace in court could take me, by your grant Far far beyond my merrit, I may make In yours a free election, but alas sir I am not mind owne, but by my destiny (Which I cannot resist) forc'd to prefer My countries smoke before the glorious fire With which your bounties warme me all I aske sir Though I cannot be ignorant it must rellish Of foule ingratitud is your gracious licence For my departure. Ladislaus. Whether? Mathias. To my owne home sir My owne poore home, which will at my returne Grow rich by your magnificence, I am heere But a body without a soule, and till I finde it In the embraces of my constant wife, &amp; to set of that constancy In her beauty and matchlesse excellencies without a riuall I am but halfe my selfe. Honoria. And is shethen So chast, and faire as you infer? Mathias. O Madam Thoug it must argue weakenes in a rich man To show his gold before an armed thiefe, And I in praysing of my wife, but seed, The fire of lust in others to attempt her, Such is my full sayld confidence in her vertue Though in my absence She were now beseeg'd By a strong army of lasciuious wooers, And euery one more expert in his art, Then those that tempted chast Penelope, Though they raisd batteries by Prodigall guifts, By admorous letters, vowes made for her seruice With all the Engins wanton appetite Could mount to shake the fortresse of her honor, Heere, heere is my assurance she holdes out kisse the picture. And is impregnable, Honoria. What's that? Mathias. Her faire figure. Ladislaus. As I liue an excellent face! Honoria. You haue seene a better. Ladislaus. I euer except yours, nay frowne not sweetest, The Cyprian Queene compard to you, in my Opinion is a Negro, as you orderd I'll see the souldier payd, and in my absence Pray you vse your powerfull arguments to stay This gentleman in our seruice. Honoria. I will doe My parts. Ladislaus. On to the campe. Exeunt Ladislaus, Ferdinand, Eubulus, Baptista, Captaines. Honoria. I am full of thoughts. And something there is heere I must giue forme to Though yet an Embrion, you Signiers Haue no businesse with the souldier, as I take it, You are for other warfare, quit the place, But be within call. Ricardo. Imployment on my life boy. Ubaldo. If it lie in our road we are made foreuer. Exeunt Ubaldo, Ricardo Honoria. You may perceiue the King is no way tainted With the disease of iealousie, since he leaues mee Thus priuate with you. Mathias. It were in him Madam A sinne vnpardonable to distrust such purenesse, Though I were an Adonis. Honoria. I presume He neither does, nor dares: and yet the story Deliuered of you by the Generall With your Herc'nk courage (which sinckes deepely Into a knowing womans heart) besides Your promising presence might beget some scruple, In a meaner man, but more of this heereafter I'll take another Theme now and coniure you By the honors you haue woone, and by the loue Sacred to your deere wife, to answere truely To what I shall demand. Mathias. You need not vse Charmes to this purpose Madam. Honoria. Tell me then Being your selfe assur'd 'tis not in man To sully with one sport th'immaculate whitenes Of your wifes honor, if you haue not since The Gordion of your loue was tide by marriage Playd false with her? Mathias. By the hopes of mercy neuer. Honoria. It may be, not frequenting the conuerse Of handsome ladies, you were neuer tempted And so your faith's vntride yet. Mathias. Surely Madam, I am no woman hater, I haue beene, Receiued to the society of the best, And fairest of our climate, and haue met with No common entertainement, yet nere felt The least heat that way, Honoria. Strange; and doe you thinke still The earth can show no beauty that can drench In Lethe all remembrance of the fauour Your now beare to your owne? Mathias. Nature must find out Some other mold to fashon a new creature Fairer then her Pandora, ere I proue Guilty or in my wishes, or my thoughts, To my Sophia. Honorio. Sir consider better Not one in our whole sex? Mathias. I am constant to My resolution. Honoria. But dare you stand The oposition, and bind your selfe By oath for the performance? Mathias. My faith else Had but a weake foundation. Honoria. I take hold Vpon your promise, and inioyne your stay For one month heere Mathias. I am caught. Honoria. And if I do not Produce a lady in that time that shall Make you confesse your error I submit My selfe to any penualtie you shall please T'impose vpon me, in the meane space write To your chast wife, acquainte her with your fortune The iewells that were mine you may send to her, For better confirmation, I'll prouide you Of trusty messengers, but how far distant is she? Mathias. A dayes hard riding. Honoria. Thers no retiring I'll bind you to your word. Mathias. Wel since there is, Noe way to shun it I will stand the hazard And instantly make ready my dispatch 'Till then, I'll leaue your maiesty. Exit Mathias. Honoria. How I burst With enuie that there liues besides my selfe One faire, and loyall woman, 'twas the end Of my ambition to be recorded The onely wonder of the age, and shall I Giue way to a competitor? nay more To adde to my affliction, the assurances That I plac'd in my beautie haue deceau'd me I thought one amorous glance of mine could bring All hearts to my subiection, but this stranger Vnmoud as rockes contemnes me, but I cannot Sit downe so with any honor, I will gaine A double victory by working him To my desire, and tainte her in her honor Or loose my selfe, I haue read that sometime poyson Is vsefull, to suplant her ile imploy With any cost Vbaldo, and Ricardo Two noted courtiers of approued cunning In all the windings of lusts labirinthe, And in corrupting him I will our goe Nerbs PoppÃ¦a, if he shut his eares, Against my Siren notes, le boldly sweare Vlysses liues againe, or that I haue found A frozen Cynike, cold in spite of all Allurements, one, whom beauty cannot mone Nor softest blandishments entice to loue.

Ladislaus. Out of my sight. Eubulus. I will sir Giue way to your furious passion, but when reason Hath got the better of it I much hope The counsaile that offends now, will deserue Your royall thankes, tranquillity of mind Stay with you sir. I do begin to doubt Ther's something more in the Queenes strangnes, then Is yet disclosd, and i'll find it out Or loose my selfe in the serch. Ferdinand.

Mathias. If I am in a prison 'tis a neat one, What O edipus can resolue this riddle? Ha! I neuer gaue iust cause to any man Basely to plot against my life, but what is Become of my true friend? for him I suffer More then my selfe. Acanthe. Remoue that idlefeare Hee's safe as you are. Mathias. Whoso'ere thou art For him I thanke thee, I cannot imagine Where I should be, though I haue read the table Or errant knighthood, stuff'd, with the relations Of magicall enchantments, yet I am not So sottishly credulous, to beleeue the diuell Hath that way power, Ha? musicke! Musicke aboue, a song of pleasure. The blushing rose and purple flower, Let grow to long are soonest blasted. Dainty fruites, though sweete, will sower And rot in ripenes, left vntasted. Yet here is one more sweete then these The more you tast, the more shee'l please. Beauty thotgh inclos'd with ice, Is A shadow chast as rare, Then how much those sweetes intice. That haue issue full as faire, Earth cannot yeeld from all her powers One equall, for Dame Venus bowers. [Mathias.] A song too, certainely be it he, or she That owes this voyce, it hath not bene acquainted With much affliction, whosoere you are That doe inhabit heere, if you haue bodies And are not meere aeriall formes appeare Enter Honoria. And make me know your end with me, most strange What haue I coiur'd vp? sure if this be, A spirit 'tis no damn'd one what a shapes heere; Then with what maiesty it moues. If Inno Were now to keepe her state among the Gods, And Hercules to be made againe her ghest She could not put on a more glorious habit Though her handmaid Iris lent her various colours Or ould Oceanus rauishd from the deepe All iewels shipwrack'd in it, as you haue Thus far made knowne your selfe, if that your face Haue not too much diuinity about it For mortall eies to gaze on, perfit what You haue begun with wonder, and amazement To my ashonish'd senses, how! the Queene! kneeles she puls of her masque. Honoria. Rise sir, and heare my reasons in defence Of the rape for so you may conceaue, which I By my instruments made vpon you, you perhaps May thinke, what you haue suffer'd for my lust Is a common practise with me, but I call Those euer shining lamps, and their great maker As witnesses of my inocence, I nere look'd on A man but your best selfe, on whom I euer (Except the King) vouchsaf'd an eie of fauour Mathias. The King indeed, and onely such a King Deserues your rarities Madam, and but hee 'Twere gyant like ambition in any In his wishes onely to presume to tast The nectar of your kisses; or to feed His appetite with that ambrosia, due And proper to a prince, and what bind mores A lawfull husband, for my selfe great Queene I am a thing obscure, disfurnish'd of All merit, that can rayse me higher then In my most humble thankefulnes for your bounty To hazard my life for you, and that way I am most ambitious. Honoria. I desire no more Then what you promise, if you dare expose Your life as you professe to doe me seruice, How can it better be imployd, then in Preseruing mine? which onely you can doe. And must doe with the danger of your owne. A desperate danger to, if priuate men Can brooke no riuals in what they affect But to the death pursue such as inuade What law makes their inheritance, the King To whom you know I am deerer then his crowne His health his eies his after-hopes with all His present blessings must fall on that man Like dreadfull lightning that is won by prayers, Threates, or rewards to staine his bed, or make His hop'd for issue doubtfull. Mathias. If you aime At what I more then feare you doe, the reasons Which you deliuer should in iudgement rather Deter me, then invite a grant, with my Assured ruine. Honoria. True if that you were Of a cold temper one whom doubt, or feare, In the most horrid formes they could put on Might teach to be ingratefull, your deniall To me, that haue deseru'd so much, is more If it can haue addition. Mathias. I know not What your commandes are. Honoria. Haue you fought so well Among armi'd men, yet cannot ghesse what lists You are to enter when you are in priuate With a willingly ladie, one, that to inioye Your company this night deni'd the King Accesse, to what's his owne, if you will presse me To speake in playner language. Mathias. Pray you forbeare, I would I did not vnderstand too much Already, by your words I am instructed To credite that, which not confirmd by you, Had bred suspition in me of vntruth Though an Angell had affirm'd it, but suppose That cloyd with happines (which is euer builte On vertuous chastity, in the wantonnesse Of appetite, you desire to make triall Of the false delights propos'd by vitious lust: Among ten thousand euery way moreable And apter to be wrought on, such as owe you Obedience being your subiects, why should you Make choice of me a stranger? Honoria. Though yet reason Was nere admitted in the court of loue, I'll yeeld you one vnanswerable, as I vrg'd In our last priuate conference, you haue A pretty promising presence, but there are Many in limbes, and feature who may take That way the right hand file of you, besides Your May of youth is pas'd, and the blood spent By woundes, though brauely taken, render you Disabld for loues seruice, and that valour Set off with better fortune, which it may be Swels you aboue your boundes' is not the hooke That hath caught me good sir I need no champion With his sword to guard my honor, or my beauty, In both I can defend my selfe, and liue My owne protection. Mathias. If these aduocates The best that can plead for me, haue no power? What can you find in me else, that may tempt you With irrecouerable losse vnto your selfe To be a gayner from me? Honoria. You haue Sir A iewell of such matchlesse worth and lustre, As does disdaine comparison, and darkens All that is rare in other men, and that I must or win, or lessen. Mathias. You heape more Amazement on me, what am I posses'd of That you can couet? make me vnderstand it, If it haue a name? Honoria. Yes an imagin'd one, But is in substance nothing, being a garment Worne out of fashion, and long since giuen ore By the court and country, tis your loyalty, And constancy to your wife, 'tis that I dote on, And does deserue my enuy, and that iewell Or by faire play, or foule, I must winne from you. Mathias. These are meere contraries, if you loue me Madam For my constancy, why seeke yo to destroy it? In my keeping it preserue me worth your fauour, Or if it be a iewell of that value, As you with labour'd rhetorick would perswad me What can you stake against it? Honoria. A Queenes fame, And equall honor. Mathias. So whoeuer wins Both shall be loosers. Honoria. That is that I aime at Yet on the by I lay my youth, my beauty This moist palme, this soft lippe, and those delights Darkenesse should onely iudge of, do you find 'em Infectious in the tryall, that you start As frighted with their touch? Mathias. Is it in man To resist such strong temptations? Honoria. He begins To wauer. Mathias. Madam as you are gracious Grant this short nights deliberation to me, And with the rising sum from me you shall Receiue full satisfaction. Honoria. Though extreames Hate all delay, I will denie you nothing, This key will bring you to your friend you are safe both And all things vsefull that could be prepar'd For one I loue and honor waite vpon you, Take counsaile of your pillow, such a fortune (As with affections swiftest wings flies to you Will not be often tendred. Exit Honoria. Mathias. How my blood Rebels! I now could call her backe and yet Ther's something stayes me, if the King had tenderd Such fauours to my wife 'tis to be doubted They had not bene refus'd, but being a man I should not yeeld first, or proue an example For her defence of fraylty, by this sans question She's tempted too, and heere I may examine looke on the picture. How shee holds out, she's still the same, the same Pure Christan rocke of chastity perish all Allurements that may alter me, the snow Of her sweete coldnes, hath extinguished quite The fire that but euen now began to flame! And I by her confirm'd, rewards, nor titles, Nor certaine death from the refused Queene Shall shake my faith, since I resolue to be Loyall to her, as she is true to me. Exit Mathias. ScÃ¦na secunda. Enter Ubaldo, Ricardo. Ubaldo. What we spake on the voley begins to worke, We haue layd a good foundation Ricardo. Build it vp Or else tis nothing, you haue by lot the honor Of the first assault, but as it is condition'd Obserue the time proportion'd, I'll not part with My share in the atchieuement, when I whistle, Or hemme fall off. Enter Sophia. Vbaldo. She comes Stand by, I'll watch My oportunity. Sophia. I find my selfe Strangely distracted with the various stories Now wel, now ill, then boubtfully by my ghests Deliuer'd of my Lord: and like poore beggers That in their dreames find treasure, by reflection Of a wounded fancie, make it questionable Whither they sleepe, or not; yet teickl'd with Such a phantasticke hope of happinesse, Wish they may neuer wake in some such measure, Incredulous of what I see, and touch As 'twere a fading apparition, I Am still perplex'd, and troubled, and when most Confirm'd tis true a curious iealousie To be assur'd, by what meanes, and from whom Such a masse of welth, was first deseru'd, then gotten Cunningly steale into me, I haue practis'd For my certaine resolution with these courtiers Promising priuate conference to either, And at this hower, if in search of the truth I heare or say more, then becomes my vertue For giue me my Mathias. Vbaldo. Now I make in, Maddam as you commanded I attend Your pleasure. Sophia. I must thanke you for the fauour. Ubaldo. I am no ghostly father, yet if you haue Some scruples, touching your Lord, you would be resolu'd of I am prepar'd. Sophia. But will you take your oath To answere truely? Vbaldo. On the hemme of your smocke if you please A vow I dare not breake it beeing a booke I would gladly swere on. Sophia. To spare sir that trouble I'll take your word which in a gentleman Should be of equall value, is my Lord then In such grace with the Queene? Vbaldo. You should best know By what you haue found from him, whether he can Deserue a grace or noe. Sophia. What grace do you meane? Ubaldo. That speciall grace (if you'l haue it) He laboured so hard for betweene a paire of sheets On your wedding night When your Ladiship lost you know what. Sophia. Fie be more modest Or I must leaue you. Vbaldo. I would tell a truth As cleanely as I could, and yet the subiecte Makes me run out a little. Sophia. You would put now A foolish ielousie in my head my Lord Hath gotten a new mistris. Vbaldo. One? a hundred But vnder seale I speake it, I presume Vpon your silence, it being for your profit, They talke of Hercules, backe for fifty in a night 'Twas well but yet to yours he was a pidler Such a souldier, and a courtier neuer came To Alba regalis, the ladies run mad for him, And there is such contention among 'em Who shall ingrosse him wholy, that the like Was neuer hard of. Sophia. Are they handsome women? Vbal. Fie noe course mammets, and whats worse they are old to Some fifty, some threescore, and they pay deere fort Beleeuing, that he carries a powder in his breeches Will make 'em young againe, and these sucke shrewdly, Ricardo. Sir I must fetch you off. Whistles. Vbaldo. I could tell you wonders Of the cures he has done, but a buisnesse of import Calls me away, but that dispatch'd I will Be with you presently. steps aside. Sophia. There is something more In this then bare suspition. Ricardo. Saue you lady Now you looke like your selfe! I haue not look'd on A lady more compleat yet haue seene a Madam Were a garment of this fashion, of the same stuffe to, One iust of your dimensions, sate the wind there boy. Sophia. What lady sir? Ricardo. Nay nothing, and me thinkes I should know this rubie very good? tis the same This chaine of orient pearle, and this diamond to Haue beene worne before, but much good may they do you Strengh to the gentlemans backe he toyld hard for 'em, Before he got 'em Sophia. Why? how were they gotten? Vbaldo hemms. Ricardo. Not in the feeld with his sword vpon my life He may thanke his close stilletto, plage vpon it Run the minutes so fast, pray you excuse my manners I left a letter in my chamber window, Which I would not haue seene on any termes, fye on it Forgetfull as I am, but I strayt attend you Ricardo steps aside. Sophia. This is strange his letters sayd these iewels were Presented him by the Queene, as a reward For his good seruice, and the trunckes of clothes That followd them this last night, with hast made vp By his direction. Enter Ubaldo. Ubaldo. I was telling you Of wonders Maddam. Sophia. If you are soe skilfull Without premeditation answere me, Know you this gowne, and these rich iewels? Ubaldo. Heauen. How things will come out, but that I should offend you, And wrong my more then noble friend Your husband for we are sworne brothers, in the discouery Of his neerest secrets I could. Sophia. By the hope of fauour That you haue from me out with it. Ubaldo. Tis a potent spell I cannot resist, why I will tell you Madam, And to how many seuerall women you are Beholding for your brauerie, this was The Wedding gowne of Paulina a rich strumpet Worme but a day when she married ould Gonzage, And left of trading. Sophia. O my hart. Ubaldo. This chaine Of pearle was a great widdowes, that inuited Your Lord to the masque, and the wether prouing foule He lodg'd in her house all night, and merry they were, But how he came by it I know not. Sophia. Periurd man! Ubaldo. This ring was Iuliettas, a fine peece But very good at the sport, this diamond Was Madam Acanthes giuen him for a song prick'd in a priuate arbor, as she sayd When the Queene askd for it, and she hard him sing to, And danc'd to his hornepipe or there are lyers abroad There are other toyes about you The same way purchas'd but paraleld With these not worth the relation. You are happy in a husband neuer man Made better vse of his strength, would you haue him wast, His body away for nothing? If he holds out, Thers not an Embrodered peticote in the court But shall be at your seruice. Sophia. I commend him It is a thriuing trade, but pray you leaue me A little to my selfe. Vbaldo. You may command Your seruant madam, she stung vnto the quicke ladd. Ricardo. I did my part if this potion worke not hang me Let her sleepe as well as she can to night, to morrow Wee'll mount new batteries, Ubaldo. And till then leaue her? Exeunt Vbaldo, Ricardo Sophia. You powers that take into your care, the gard Of inocence ayd me, for I am a creature, Soe forfeyted to dispaire, hope cannot fancie A ransome to redeeme me, I begin To wauer in my faith and marke it doubtfull Whither the Saints that were canoniz'd for Their holines of life find not in secret. Since my Mathias is falne from his vertue In such an open fashion, could it be else That such a husband so deuoted to me, so vow'd to temperance, for laciuious hire Should prostitute himselfe to common harlots Ould, and deform'd to wast for this he left me? And in a faind pretence for want of meanes To giue me ornament? or to bring home Diseases to me? suppose these are false, And lustfull goates if he were true and right Why stayes he so long from me? being made rich And that the onely reason why he left me. No he is lost; and shall I weare the spoiles. And Salaries of lust? they cleaue vnto me Like Nessus poyson'd shirt? no in my rage I'll teare 'em of, and from my body wash The venome with my teares, haue I no spleene Nor anger of a woman? shall he build Vpon my ruins and I vureueng'd Deplore his falshood? no? with the same trash For which he hath dishonor'd me, I'll purchase A iust reuenge, I am not yet so much In debt to yeares, nor so misshap'd that all Should flie from my Embraces, chastity Thou onely art a name, and I renounce thee, I am now a seruant to voluptuousnesse, Wantons of all degrees and fashions welcome You shall be entertain'd, and if I stray Let him condemne himselfe, that lead the way.

We are in a desperat straight, ther's no euasion Nor hope left to come of, but by your yeelding To the necessity, you must faine a grant To her violent passion, or Mathias. What my Baptista? Baptista. We are but dead else. Mathias. Were the sword now heau'd vp, And my necke vpon the blocke, I would not buy An howers repriue with the losse of faith and vertue To be made immortall heere, art thou a scholler Nay almost without paralell, and yet feare To dye which is incuitable you may vrge The many yeeres that by the course of nature We may trauaile in this tedious pilgrimage, And hou'd it as a blessing, as it is When innocence is our guid, yet know Baptista Our vertues are preferu'd before our yeeres By the great iudge to dye vntaynted in Our fame, and reputation is the greatest And to loose that can we desire to liue? Or shall I for a momentary pleasure Which soone comes to a period, to all times Haue breach of faith and periury remembred In a still liuing Epitath, no Baptist, Since my Sophia will go to her graue Vnspotted in her faith, I'll follow her With equall loyalty, but looke on this your owne great worke, your masterpeese, and then She being still the same teach me to alter. Ha! sure I doe not sleepe! or if I dreame, The picture altred. This is a terrible vision! I will cleare My eiesight, perhaps melancholly makes me See that which is not. Baptista. It is to apparent. I grieue to looke vpon't, besides the yellow That does assure she's tempted there are lines Of a darke colour, that disperse themselues Ore euery miniature of her face, and those Confirme. Mathias. She is turnd whore. Baptista. I must not say so. Yet as a friend to truth if you will haue me Interpret it, in her consent, and wishes She's false but not in fact yet. Mathias. Fact Baptista? Make not your selfe a pandar to her loosenes, In labouring to palliate what a vizard Of impudence cannot couer did ere woman In her will decline from chastety, but found meanes To giue her hot lust fukll? it is more Impossible in nature for grosse bodies Descending of themselues, to hang in the ayre, Or with my single arme to vnderprop A falling tower, nay in its violent course To stoppe the lightning then to stay a woman Hurried by two furies lust and falshood In her full carier to wickednes. Baptista. Pray you tempter The violence of your passion. Mathias. In extreames Of this condition, can it be in man To vse a moderation? I am throwne From a steepe rocke headlong into a gulph Of misery, and find my selfe past hope In the same moment that I aprehend That I am falling and this the figure of My Idoll few howers since, while she cotinued In her perfection that was late a mirror In which I saw miracules shapes of duty, Stayd manners with all excellency a husband Could wish in a chast wife, is on the suddaine Turnd to a magicall glasse, and does present Nothing but hornes, and horror Baptista. You may yet And 'tis the best foundation, build vp comfort On your owne goodnes. Mathias. Noe, that hath vndone me For now I hold my temperance a sinne Worse then excesse, and what was vice a vertue, Haue I refus'd a Queene, and such a Queene Whose rauishing beauties at the first sight had tempted A hermit from his beades, and chang'd his prayers To amorous Sonets, to preserue my faith Inuiolate to thee, with the hazard of My death with tortrne, since she could inflict No lesse for my contempt, and haue I made Such a returne from thee? I will not curse thee, Nor for thy falshood raile against the sex 'Tis poore, and common, Ile onely with wise men Whisper vnto my selfe, howere they seeme Nor present, nor past times, nor the age to come Hath heeretofore, can now, or euer shall Produce on constant woman. Baptista. This is more Then the Satirists wrot against 'em. Mathias. Ther's no language That can expresse the poyson of these Aspicks, These weeping Crocadiles, and all to little That hath beeing sayd against 'em but I'll mould My thoughts into another forme, and if She can out-liue the report of what I haue donne This hand when next she comes within my reach Shall be her executioner.

Honoria. Haue you taken Good rest in your new lodgings? I expect now Your resolute answere, but aduise maturely Before I heare it, Mathias. Let my actions Madam, For no words can dilate my ioy in all You can command with cherefulnes to serue you, Assure your highnes, and in signe of my Submission, and contrition for my error. My lipps, that but the last night shund the touch Of yours as poyson, taught humility now Thus on your foot, and that too great an honor For such an vndeseruer seales my duty, A cloudy mist of ignorance equall to Cimmerian darkenes, would not let me see then What now with adoration, and wonder With reuerence I looke vp to: but those foggs Dispersd and scatterd by the powerfull beames With which your selfe the Sun of all perfection, Vouchsafe to cure my blindnes like a suppliant As low as I can kneele I humbly begge What you once pleasd to tender. Honoria. This is more Then I could hope, what find you so attractiue Vpon my face in so short time to make This suddaine Metamorphosis? pray you rise; I for your late neglect thus signe your pardon. I now you kisse like a louer, and not as brothers Coldly salute their sisters. Mathias. I am turnd All spirit and fire. Honoria. Yet to giue some allay To this hot feruor 'twere good to remember The King, whose eies and eares are euery where With the danger to that followes, this discouer'd. Mathias. Danger? a bugge beare Maddam let ride once Like Phaeton in the the Chariot of your fauour, And I contemne Ioues thunder though the King In our embraces stood a looker on, His hang-men and with studied cruelty ready To dragge me from your armes, it should not fright me From the inioying that, a single life is Too poore a price for, O that now all vigour Of my youth were recollected for an hower That my desire might meete with yours and draw The enuy of all men in the Encounter Vpon my head, I should, but we loose time, Be gratious mighty Queene Honoria. Pause yet a little The bounties of the King, and what weighs more Your boasted constancie to your machlesse wife, Should not soone be shaken. Mathias. The whole fabricke When I but looke on you, is in a moment Oreturnd, and ruind, and as riuer's loose Their names, when they are swalloed by the Ocean In you alone all faculties of my soule Are wholy taken vp, my wife, and King At the best as things forgotten. Honoria. Can this be? I haue gaynd my end now. Mathias. Wherefore stay you Madam? Honoria. In my consideration what a nothing Man's constancy is. Mathias. Your beauties make it so, In me sweet lady. Honoria. And it is my glory: I could be coy now as you were, but I Am of a gentler temper, howsoeuer, And in a iust returne of what I haue suffer'd In your disdaine, with the same measure graunt me Equall deliberation I ere long Will visite you againe and when I next Appeare, as conquerd by it, slauelike wayt On my triumphant beauty. Exit Honoria. Mathias. What a change Is heere beyond my feare but by thy falshood Sophia not her beauty is it deni'd me To sinne but in my wishes? what a frowne In scorne at her departure she threw on me? I am both waies lost; stormes of Contempt, and scorne Are ready to breake on me, and all hope Of shelter doubtfull I can neither be Disloyall, nor yet honest, I stand guilty On either part, at the worst death will end all, And he must be my iudge to right my wrong, Since I haue lou'd too much and liu'd too long. Exit Mathias. ScÃ¦na secunda. Enter Sophia sola with a booke and a note. Sophia. Nor custome nor example, nor vast numbers Of such as doe offend make lesse the sinne, For each particular crime a strict accompt Will be exacted, and that comfort which The damnd pretend, fellowes in misery, Takes nothing from their torments, euery one Must suffer in himselfe the measure of His wickednes, if so, as I must grant It being vnrefutable in reason, Howere my Lord offend, it is no warrant For me to walke in his forbidden paths, What penance then can expiate my guilte For my consent (transported then with passion) To wantonnesse? the woundes I giue my fame Cannot recouer his and though I haue fedd These courtiers with promises and hopes I am yet in fact vntainted and I trust My sorrow for it with my purity And loue to goodnes for it selfe, made powerfull Though all they haue alleadg'd proue true or false, Will be such exorcisines as shall command This furie iealousie from me, what I haue Determind touching them I am resolu'd To put in execution, Within there?

I warant you, I am sound as a bell, a tough Old blade, and steele to the backe, as you shall find me In the triall on your anuill. Sophia. So, but how sir Shall I satisfie your friend to whom by promise I am equally ingag'd? Vbaldo. I must confesse The more the merier, but of all men liuing Take heed of him you may safer run vpon The mouth of a cannon, when it is vnlading And come off colder. Sophia. How! is he not holsome? Vbaldo. Holsome? I'll tell you for your good, he is A spittle of diseases and indeed More lothsome and infections, the tubbe is His weekely bath; He hath not dranke this seauen yeare Before he came to your house, but compositions Of Sassafras, and Guacum, and drie mutton His daily portion; name what scratch soeuer Can be got by women and the Surgeons will resolue you At this time or at that Ricardo had it. Sophia. Blesse me from him. Vbaldo. 'Tis a good prayer Lady, It being a degree vnto the pox. Onely to mention him, if my tongue burne not hange me When I but namd Ricardo. Sophia. Sir this caution Must be rewarded. Vbaldo. I hope I haue marrd his market. But when? Sophia. Why presently follow my woman She knowes where to conduct you, and will serue To night for a page, let the wast cote I apointed With the cambricq shirt perfumd, and the rich cappe Be brought into his chamber.

Take purse and all Hilario. If this company would come often. I should make a pretty terme on't, Sophia. For your sake I haue put him off, he only begd a kisse I gaue it and so parted. Ricardo. I hope better He did not touch your lipps? Sophia. Yes I assure you. There was no danger in it. Ricardo. No? eate presently These lozenges, of forty crownes an ounce, Or you are vndone. Sophia. What is the vertue of 'em. Ricardo. They are preseruatiues against stinking breath Rising from rotten lungs. Sophia, If so your carriage Of such deere antidotes in my opinion May render yours suspected. Ricardo. Fie no I vse 'em When I talke with him I should be poysond else. But I'll be free with you. Hee was once a creature It may be of Gods making, but long since He is turnd to a druggists shoppe, the spring and fall Hold all the yeere with him that he liues he owes To art not nature, she has giuen him ore. He moues like the faery King, on serues and wheeles Made by his Doctors recipes, and yet still They are out of ioynt, and euery day reparing He has a regiment of whores he keepes At his owne charge in a lazar house but the best is There's not arose among 'em: Hee's acquainted With the greene water and the spitting pill Familiar to him, in a frosty morning You may thrust him in a pottle pot his bones Rattle in his Skinne like beanes tos'd in a bladder If he but heere a coche the fomentation The Friction with funigation cannot saue him From the chine euill in a word he is Not on disease but all, yet being my friend I wil forbeare his caracter, for I would not Wrong him in your opinion. Sophia, The best is The vertues you bestow on him to me Are mistries I know not but howeuer I am at your seruice. Sirrha let it be your care T'vncloth the gentleman, and with speed, delay Takes from delight. Ricardo. Good, there's my hat, sword, cloke, A vengeance on these buttons, off with my dublet I dare show my Skinne, in the touch you will like it better Prethe cut my codpeese poynt, and for this seruice When I leaue them off they are thine. Hilario. I'll take your word sir. Ricardo. Deere lady stay not long. Sophia. I may come too soone sir Ricardo. No, no I am ready now, Hilario. This is the way sir. Exeunt Hilario, and Ricardo. Sophia. I was much too blame to credit their reports Touching my Lord that so traduce each other And with such virulent malice, though I presume They are bad enough, but I haue studied for 'em A way for their recouerie.

The other birds i'th cage too let him flutter. Ricardo. Whither am I falne into Hell? Vbaldo. Who makes that noyse there? Helpe me if thou art a friend? Ricardo. A friend? I am where I cannot helpe my selfe, let me see thy face. Vbaldo. How Ricardo! prethe throw me Thy cloke, if thou canst to couer me I am almost Frozen to death. Ricardo.

Noe but soundly punish'd To your diserts. Ricardo. You are not in earnest Madam? Sophia. Iudge as you find, and feele it, and now heere What I irreuocablie purpose to you. Being receau'd as ghests into my house And with all it afforded entertaind You haue forgot all hospitable duties, And with the defamation of my Lord Wrought on my woman weakenesse in reuenge Of his iniuries, as you fashiond 'em to me, To yeeld my honor to your lawlesse lust. Hilario. Marke that poore fellowes. Sophia. And so far you haue Transgres'd against the dignity of men (who should, bound to it by vertue, still defend Chast ladies honors) that it was your trade To make 'em in famous, but you are caught In your owne toiles like lustfull beasts, and therfore Hope not to find the vsage of men from me Such mercie you haue forfeited, and shall suffer Like the most slauish women. Vbaldo. How will you vse vs? Sophia. Ease and excesse in feeding made you wanton A plurisie of ill blood you must let out. By labour, and spare diet, that way got to, Or perish for hunger, reach him vp that distaffe With the flax vpon it, though no Omphale Nor you a second Hercules, as I take it As you spinne well at my command, and please me Your wages in the coursest bread, and water, Shall be proportionable. Vbaldo. I will starue first. Sophia. That's as you please. Ricardo. What will become of me now? Sophia. You shall haue gentler worke I haue oft obseru'd You were proud to show the finenesse of your hands, And softnes of your fingers, you should reele well What he spins if you giue your mind to it, as ill force you Deliuer him his materialls.

Let me haue my clothes yet, I was bountifull to thee. Hilario. They are past your wearing And mine by promise, as all these can witnes You haue no holydaies comming, nor will I worke While these, and this lasts and so when you please You may shut vp your shoppe windowes.

But let vs rest aswell as we can to night But not ore sleepe our selues, least we fast to morrow. They drew the curtaines. ScÃ¦na tertij. Enter Ladislaus, Honoria, Eubulus, Ferdinand, Acanthe, attendance. Honoria. Now you know all sir with the motiues why I forc'd him to my lodging. Ladislaus. I desire No more such trials Lady. Honoria. I presume sir You do not doubt my chastity. Ladislaus. I would not, But these are strange inducements. Eubulus. By no meanes sir Why though he were with violence ceasd vpon, And still detaynd the man sir being no souldier Nor vsd to charge his pike when the breach is open There was no danger in't: you must conceiue sir, Being relligious, she Chose him for a Chaplaine To read old Homelies to her in the darke, Shee's bound to it by her Cannons. Ladislaus. Still tormented With thy impertinence. Honoria. By your selfe deere sir. I was ambitious onely to ouer throw His boasted constancy in his consent, But for fact I contemne him, I was neuer Vnchast in thought, I laboured to giue proofe What power dwels in this beauty you admire so, And when you see how soone it hath transform'd him, And with what superstition hee addores it, Determine as you please. Ladislaus. I will looke on This pageant but. Honoria. When you haue seene and hard sir. The passages, which I my selfe discouer'd, And could haue kept conceal'd had I meant basely Iudge as you please. Ladislaus. well Ill obserue the issue. Eubulus. How had you tooke this Generall in your wife? Ferdinand. As a strange curiosity, but Queenes Are priuiledgd aboue subiects, and tis fit sir. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na quarti. Enter Mathias, Batista. Baptista. You are much alterd sir since the last night When the Queene left you, and looke cheerefully Your dulnesse quite blowne ouer. Mathias. I haue seene a vision This morning makes it good, and neuer was In such security as at this instant, Fall what can fall, and when the Queene appeares Whose shortest absence now is tedious to me, Obserue 'th incounter. Enter Honoria, Ladislaus, Eubulus, Ferdinand Acanthe, with others aboue. Baptista. She already is Entred the lists. Mathias. And I prepard to meete her. Baptista. I know my duty. Honoria. Not so you may stay now As a witnes of our contract. Baptista. I obey In all things Madam. Honoria. Wher's that reuerence, Or rather superstitious addoration, Which captiue like to my triumphant beauty You payd last night? no humble knee? nor signe Of vassall duty? sure this is the foote, To whose proud couer, and then happy in it, Your lipps were glewd; and that the necke then offer'd To witnes your subiection to be trod on Your certaine losse of life in the Kings anger Was then to meane a price to buy my fauour. And that false glowe worme fire of constancie To your wife, extinguished by a greater light Shot from our eyes; and that it may be (being To glorious to be look'd on) hath depriu'd you Of speech, and motion: but I will take off A little from the splendor, and descend From my owne height, and in your lownesse heere you Plead as a suppliant. Mathias. I do remember I once saw such a woman. Honoria. How! Mathias. And then She did appeare a most magnificent Queene And what's more vertuous though somewhat darkned With pride and selfe oppinion. Eubulus. Call you this courtship? Mathias. And she was happy in a royall husband, Whom enuie could not tax, vnlesse it were For his too much indulgence to her humors. Eubulus. Pray you sir obserue that touch, 'tis to the purpose I like the play the better for't. Mathias. And she liu'd Worthy her birth, and fortune; you retayne yet Some part of her angelicall forme, but when Enuie to the beauty of another woman Inferior to hers, (one she neuer Had seene but in her picture) had dispers'd Infection through her veines and loyaltie Which a great Queene as shee was should haue nourish'd Grew odious to her Honoria. I am thunderstrocke. Mathias. And lust in all the brauery it could borrow From maiesty, howere disguisde had tooke Sure footing in the kingdome of her heart (The throne of chastity once,) how in a moment All that was gratious, great, and glorious in her And woone vpon all hearts, like seeming shadowes Wanting true substance vanish'd. Honoria. How his reasons Worke on my Soule. Mathias. Retire into your selfe. Your owne strengths Madam, strongly man'd with vertue And be but as you were, and there's no offence. So base beneath the slauery, that men Impose on beasts, but I will gladly bow to. But as you play, and iuggle with a stranger Varying your shapes like Thetis though the beauties Of all that are by Poets raptures Sainted Were now in you vnited, you should passe Pittied by me perhaps, but not regarded. Eubulus. If this take not I am cheated. Mathias. To slip once Is incident, and excusde by humane fraylty, But to fall euer damnable we were both Guilty I grant in tendering our affection, But, as I hope you will doe, I repented. When we are growne vp to ripenesse, our life is Like to this picture. While we runne A constant race in goodnesse, it retaines The iust proportion. But the iourneyes being Tedious and sweet temptations in the way, That may in some degree diuert vs from The rode that we put forth in, ere we end Our pilgrimage, it may like this turne yellow Or be with blacknesse clouded. But when we Finde we haue gone astray, and labour to Returne vnto our neuer fayling guide Vertue, contrition with vnfained teares, The spots of vice wash'd off will soone restore it To the first purenesse. Honoria. I am disenchanted Mercy, O mercy heauens? kneeles Ladislaus. I am rauished with What I haue seene and hard. Ferdinand. Let vs descend and heere The rest below. Eubulus. This hath falne out beyond My expectation. they descend. Honoria. How haue I wandred Out of the tract of piety and misled By ouerweening pride, and flattery Of fawning sycophants (the bane of greatnes) Could neuer meete till now a passenger That in his charity would set me right, Or stay me in my precipice to ruine. How ill haue I return'd your goodnes to me? The horror in my thought oft turnes me marble. Enter the King and others, But if it may be yet preuented, O sir, What can I do to shew my sorrow or With what brow aske your pardon? Ladislaus. Pray you rise. Honoria. Neuer, till you forgiue me, and receiue Vnto your loue, and fauour a chang'd woman. My state, and pride turn'd to humility henceforth Shall waite on your commands, and my obedience Steer'd only by your will. Ladislaus, And that will proue A second and a better marriage to me, all is forgot Honoria. Sir I must not rise yet Till with a free confession of a crime, Vnknowne to you yet, and a following suite Which thus I beg be granted. Ladislaus. I melt with you. Tis pardon'd, and confirm'd thus. Honoria. Know then sir. In malice to this good knights wife I practis'd Ubaldo, and Ricardo, to corrupt her. Baptista. Thence grew the change of the picture. Honoria. And how far They haue preuaild I am ignorant now if you sir Or the honor of this goodman, may be intreated To trauaile thither, it being but a dayes iourney To fetch 'em off, Ladislaus. We will put on to night. Baptista. I if you please your harbinger. Ladislaus. I thanke you. Let me embrace you in my armes, your seruice Donne on the Turke compard with this waighs nothing. Mathias. I am still your humble creature. Ladslaius. My true friend Ferdinand. And so you are bound to hold him. Eubulus. Such a plante Imported to your Kingdome, and heere grafted Would yeeld more fruit then all the idle weedes That sucke vp your raigne of fauour. Ladislaus. In my will Ill not be wanting, prepare for our iourney. In acte be my Honoria now, not name, And to all after times preserue thy fame. Exeunt. The end of the fourth Act.</field>

It may appeare prepostrous in women Soe to encounter, 'tis your pleasure Madam And not my proud ambition, do you heere sir. Without a magicall picture in the touch, I find your printe of close and wanton kisses On the Queenes lipps Mathias. Vpon your life be silent. And now salute these Lords. Sophia. Since you'll haue me You shall see I am experienc'd at the game And can play it titely, you are a braue man sir And do deserue a free and harty welcome Be this the prologe to it. Eubulus.

Mathias. Forbeare. Or you will rayse my anger to a height, That will descend in fury. Sophia. Whie? you know How to resolue your selfe what my intents are, By the helpe of Mephostophiles, and your picture, Pray you looke vpon't againe, I humbly thanke The Queenes great care of me, while you were absent. She knew how tedious 'twas for a young wife, And being for that time a kind of widdow, To passe away her melancholly howers Without good company, and in charity therefore Prouided for me, out of her owne store She culd the Lords Ubaldo, and Ricardo, Two principall courtiers for Ladies seruice, To do me all good offices, and as such Imployd by her, I hope I'haue receaud, And entertaind 'em, nor shall they depart Without the effect arissing from the cause That brought 'em hither. Mathias. Thou dost be-lye thy selfe, I know that in my absence thou wer't honest, Howeuer now turnd monster. Sophia. The truth is We did not deale like you in speculations On cheating pictures; we knew shadowes were No substances and actuall performance The best assurance, I will bring 'em hither To make good in this presence so much for me. Some minutes space I begge your maiesties pardon You are mou'd now champe vpon this bit a little Anon you shall haue another, waite me Hilario. Exeunt Sophia, &amp; Hilario. Ladislaus. How now? turnd statue sir? Mathias. Flie, and flie quicklie From this cursed habitation, or this Gorgon Will make you all as I am, in her tongue Millions of adders hisse, and euery hayre Vpon her wicked head a snake more dreadfull Then that Tisiphon, threw on Athamas, Which in his madnes forc'd him to dismember His proper issue O that euer I Repos'd my trust in magicke, or beleeud Impossiblities, or that charmes had power Eubulus. These are the fruites Of marriage, and old batchelor, as I am, And what's more will continue so, is not troublde With these fine fagaries. Ferdinand. Till you are resolu'd sir, Forsake not hope. Baptista. Vpon my life this is Dissimulation. Ladislaus. And it sutes not with Your fortitude and wisdome to be thus Transported with your passion. Honoria. You were once Deceaud in me sir as I was in you, Yet the deceipte please both. Mathias. She hath confes'd all, What further proofe should I aske? Honoria. Yet remember The distance that is interpos'd betweene A womans tongue, and her hart, and you must grant You build vpon no certaineties. Enter Sophia, Corisca, Hilario, Ubaldo, &amp; Ricardo, as before. Eubulus. What haue we heere? Sophia. You must come on and show you selues. Vbaldo. The King! Ricardo. And Queene too, would I were as far vnder the earth As I am aboue it. Vbaldo. Some Poet will Prom this relation, or in verse, or proofe, Or both together blended render vs Ridiculous to all ages, Ladislaus. I remember This face when it was in a better plight Are not you Ricardo? Honoria. And this thing I take it Was once Vbaldo. Vbaldo. I am now I know not what. Ricardo. We thanke your maiesty for imploying vs To this subiill Circe. Eubulus. How my Lord? turnd spinster. Do you worke by the day or by the great? Ferdinand. Is your Theorbo Turnd to a distaffe Signior, and your voyce With which you chanted rome for a lusty gallant Turnd to the note of lacreymÃ¦? Eubulus. Prethee tell me For I know thou art free, how often and to the purpose Haue you beene merry with this lady. Ricardo. Neuer, neuer. Ladislaus. Howsoeuer you should say so, for your credit Being the only court bull. Vbaldo. O that euer I saw this kicking heyfer, Sophia. You see Madam How I haue curd your seruants, and what fauours They with their rampaht valour haue woone from me. You may as they are phisickd, I presume Trust a faire virgine with 'em, they haue learnd Their seuerall trades to liue by, and payd nothing But cold, and hunger for 'em, and may now Set vp for them selues for heere I giue 'em ouer, And now to you sir, why doe you not againe, Peruse your picture? and take the aduice Of your learned consort? these are the men, or none That made you, as the Italian sayes a beco. Mathias. I know not which way to intreat your pardon Nor am I worthy of it my Sophia, My best Sophia, heere before the king, The Queene, these Lords, and all the lookers on I do renounce my error, and embrace you As the great example to all after times For such as would dye chast, and noble wiues With reuerence to immitate. Sophia. Not so sir. I yet hold of, howeuer I haue purg'd My doubted innocence, the foule aspertions In your vnmanly doubts cast on my honor Cannot so soone be washd of. Eubulus. Shall we haue More ijggobobs yet? Sophia. When you went to the warrs I set no spie vpon you to obserue which way you wandred, though our sex by nature Is subiect to suspitions and feares, My confidence in your loyalty freed me from 'em. But to deale as you did gainst your religion With this inchanter to suruey my actions Was more then womans weaknes, therefore know And tis my boone vnto the King, I doe Desire a seperation from your bed For I will spend the remnant of my life In prayer, and meditation. Mathias. O take pitty Vpon my weake condition, or I am More wretched in your innocence, then if I had found you guilty, haue you showne a iewell Out of the cabinet of your rich mind To locke it vp againe? She turnes away Will none speake for me? shame, and sinne hath robd me Of the vse of my tongue. Ladislaus. Since you haue conquerd Maddam You wrong the glory of your victory If you vse it not with mercy. Ferdinand. Any penance You please to impose vpon him I dare warrant He will gladly suffer. Eubulus. Haue I liu'd to see But on good woman, and shall we for a trifle Haue her returne nun? I will first pull downe the cloyster To the ould sport againe with a good lucke to you 'Tis not alone enough that you are good, We must haue some of the breed of you, will you destroy The kind, and race of goodnesse? I am conuerted And aske your pardon Madam for my ill opinion Against the sex, and show me but two such more I'll marry yet, and loue em. Honoria. She that yet Nere knew what 'twas to bend but to the King Thus begge remission for him. Sophia. O deere Madam Wrong not your greatnesse so. Omnes. We all are sutors. Vbaldo. I do deserue to bee hard among the rest. Ricardo. And we haue sufferd for it Sophia. I perceiue Thers no resistance but suppose I pardon What's past, who can secure me, He'll be free From iealousie heereafter. Mathias. I will be My owne security, go ride where you please, Feast, reuele, banquet, and make choise with whom I'll set no watch vpon you, and for proofe, oft This cursed picture I surrender vp To a consuming fire, Baptista. As I abuire The practise of my art. Sophia. Vpon this termes. I am reconcil'd and for these that haue payd The price of their folly, I desire your mercy. Ladislaus. At your request they haue it. Vbaldo. Hang all trades now. Ricardo. I will find a new one, and that is to liue honest. Hilario. These are my fee's. Ubaldo. Pray you take 'em with a mischeefe. Ladislaus. So all ends in peace now And to all married men be this a caution. Which they should duly tender as their life Neither to dote to much nor doubt a wife. Exeunt Omnes. FINIS.</field>
