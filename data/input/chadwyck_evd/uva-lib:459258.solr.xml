If chyldren be noseled in idlenes and yll, And brought vp therin, it is hard to restrayne, And draw them from naturall wont euyll, As here in thys Interlude, ye shall se playne. By two chyldren brought vp wantonly in play, Whom ye mother doth excuse, wh? she should chastise They delyte in daliaunce and mischief alway, At last they ende theyr lyues in miserable wyse. The mother perswaded by worldly shame, That she was the cause of theyr wretched lyfe, So pensife, so sorowfull, for theyr death, she became, That in despaire she would slea her self with a knife Then her sonne Barnabas, (by interpretacyon, The sonne of comfort,) her yll purpose do stay, By the scriptures he geueth her godly consolation And so concludeth, all these partes wyll we playe.</field>

If I go before, they do me threate, To complayne to my mother, she for theyr sake, Being her tender tidlynges, wyll me beate: Lorde, in thys perplexit ye, what way shall I take? What wyl become of them? grace god them sende, To apply their learnyng, and theyr maners amend. Ismael and Dalila come in syngyng. Here we comen, and here we louen, And here we will abide abyde ay.

Alas wretched wretche that I am, Most miserable caitife that euer was borne, Full of payne and sorow, croked and lome. Stuft with diseases in this world forlorne. My senowes be shronken, my flesh eaten wt pocks My bones ful of ache, &amp; great payne, My head is bald, that bare yelowe lockes, Croked I crepe to the earth agayne, Mine eie sigth is dimme, my hands tremble &amp; shake My stomake abhorreth all kynd of meate: For lacke of clothes, great colde I take, When appetide serueth, I can get no meate. Where I was fayre and amiable of face, Now am I foule and horrible to se, Al this I haue I deserued for lacke of grace, Iustly for my sinnes god doth plague me. My parentes did tidle me, they were to blame, In steade of correction, in yll did me maintain: I fell no naught, and shall dye with shame Yet all thys is not halfe of my greife and payne. The worme of my conscience yt shall neuer dye, Accuseth me dayly more and more: So oft haue I sinned wilfully, That I feare to be damned for euermore. Barnabas. What wofull wight art thou? tell me, That here most greuously doest lament, Confesse the truth, and I wil comfort the, By the word of god omnipotent: Although your tyme ye haue mispent, Repent and amend while ye haue space, And god wyll restore you to health and grace. Dalila. To tell you who I am I dare not for shame, But my filthy liuing hath brought me in this case, Full oft for my wantonnes you dyd me blame, yet to take your councel I had not the grace, To be restored to health, alas it is past, Disease hath brought me into suche decay, Helpe me with your almose, while my lyfe doth laste That like a wretche as I am, I may go my way. Barnabas. Shewe me your name sister I you pray, And I wil helpe you now at your nede, Both body and soule wyl I fede. Dalila. your haue named me already, if I dust be so bold you sister Dalila, that wreche I am, My wanton nice toyes ye knew of olde, Alas brother they haue brought me to thys shame, Wh? you went to scole, my brother &amp; I wold play Sweare, chide, &amp; scodle weth man and woman, To do shrewde turnes, our delyte was alwaye, Yet were we tidled, and you beaten now &amp; than, Thus our parentes let vs do what we woulde, And you by correction they kepthe vnder awe: When we grewe bigge, we were sturdye and bolde By father and mother we set not a strawe, Small matter for me, I am past, But your brother and mine is in gread ieoperdy: In daunger to come to shame at the last, He frameth hys liuyng so wyckedly. Barnabas. Well siker, I euer feared ye would be nought, your lewde behauiours sore greue my hart: to trayn you to goodnes, al meanes haue I sought, But in vaine, yet wyl I play a brotherly part. For ye the soul is more precyous, most derely bought with the bloud of Christe, dying therfore: To saue it first, a meane must be sought, At gods hand by Chryste, mannes onely sauior. Consider Dalila, goddes fatherly godnes, Which for your good, hath brought you in thys case. Scourged you with hys rod of pure loue doubtles. that ones knowing your self, ye might cal for grace, Ye seme to repent, but I doubt whater, For your sinnes, or for the misery ye be in: Earnestly repent for your synne rather, For these plagues be but the reward of sinne, But so repent that ye sinne no more, And then beleue with stedfast faith: That god wyll forgeue you for euermore, For Chrystes sake, as the scripture sayth. As for your bodye, if it be curable, I wyll cause to be healed, or duryng your life: I wyl clothe you, and fete you as I am able, Come sister, go with me, ye haue nede of relief. Thei go out Daniel ye Iudge &amp; Iniqui. ye Bayly errand come in the Iudge sitteth As a iudge of the countrey, here am I come, Sent by the kynges Maiestye, Iustyce to do: Chiefly to procede in iudgement of a Felon, I tary for the verdite of the quest ere I go. Go baily, know whether they be all a greed or no If they be so, byd them come away And bring their prisoner, I wold hear what they say Iniqui. I go my Lord, I go, to soone for one, He is lyke to play a cast, wil breake his necke bone, I beseche your lorshyp be good to hym, The man is come of good kynne, If your Lordshyp would be so good to me, As for my sake to set hym free, He telleth hym in hys eare the all may heare I could haue .xx. pount in a purse, Yea, and your Lordshyp a right faire horse, Well worth ten pound. Daniel the iudge. Get the away thou hell hound, Iniquitye goeth oute ye iudge speaketh styll, If ye were well examined and tried, Perchaunce a false knaue ye would be spyed, Brybes (saith Salomon) blind ye wise mans sight That he can not se to geue iudgement right, Should I be a bribar? nay, he shall haue the law As I owe to god and the kyng obedience and awe. Iniqui. Ye be tyed fayre ynough for runnyng away They bring Ismael in bound lyke a prysoner. If ye do not after me, ye wyll be hanged I dare say If thou tell no tales, but holde thy toungue, I wyl set the at lybertye ere it be longe, Though thou be iudged to dye anon, Iudge. Come on firs, I pray you come on, Be you all agreed in one? one of th? speketh for ye quest. yea my Lord, euery chone, Iudge. Where Ismael was intided by .xii. men, Of Felony, burglary, and murdre, As thinditement declareth, howe, where, and when ye heard it read to you lately in ordre: you with the rest, I trust all true men, Be charged vp? your othes to gyue verdyte directly, Whether Ismael therof be gilty or not gilty, One for ye quest Gilty (my Lord) and most gilty, Iniqui. Wilt thou hange my Lord, horeson noddy? Iudge. The lorde haue mercy vpon the, Iniqui. Tusshe, holde thy tonge and I warrant the Iudge. Thou shalt go to the place thou camst fro, Tyl to morow .ix. of the clocke, there to remain, To the place of execution then shalt thou go. There be hanged to death, and after again, Being dead, for ensample, to be hanged in a chain. Take hym away, and se it be done, At your perill that may fall thereupon. Ismael. Though I be iudged to dye, I require respite, For the kinges aduantage in thinges I can recite, Iniqui. A way with him he wyll speake but of spyte, Iudge. well, we will heare you say what you can. But se that ye wrongfully accuse no man, Ismael I wyll be lye no man, but thys I may say, Here standeth he that brought me to thys waye: Iniqui. My Lorde, he lyeth like a dampned knaue, The feare of death doth make hym raue, Ismael His naughtye company and playe at dice, Dyd me first to stealyng entice. He was wt me at roberies, I say it to his face, yet can I say more in tyme &amp; space, Iniqui. Thou hast said to much, I beshrew thi horsons face Hange him my Lord, out of the way, The thief careth not what he doth say Let me be hangman, I wil teathe him a sleight, For feare of talkyng I wil strangle him streight, Tary here that lyst, for I wyl go. he would go. Iudge. No no my frend, not so, I thought alwayes ye should not be good, And now it wil proue, I se by the rood, They take h? in a halter &amp; he fighteth wt them Take him and lay him in yrons stronge, We wil talke with you more ere it be longe, Iniqui. He that layeth handes on me in this place, Iche lay my brawlyng yron on his face: By gogs bloud I defye thy worst, If thou shouldest hange me I were a curst. I haue bene at as low an ebbe as this, And quyckely a loft again by gisse: I haue mo frendes then ye thynke I haue, I am entertained of all men lyke no slaue: Yea, within this moneth I may say to you, I wyl be your seruaunt, and your maister to, ye, crepe into your brest, wyl ye haue it so? Iudge. A way with them both, leade them away, At his death tell me what he doth say, For then be lyke he wyll not lye, Iniqui. I care not for you both, no not a sly: they lead th? out. Iudge. If no man haue here, more matter to say I must go hence some other way. he goeth out. worldly shame. Hah ha, though I come in rudely be not agast, I must worke a feate in al the hast, I haue caught two byrdes, I wyll set for the dame, If I catche her in my clutche, I wyl her tame. Of all thys while know ye not my name? I am right worshipfull maister wordly shame, The matter that I come now about, Is euen thys, I put you out of dought. There is none Xantippe, a curst shrew, I thynke al the world doth her knowe, Suche a iade she is, and so curst a quene, She would out scold the deuils dame I wene. Sirs thys fine woman, had babes three, Twayne the derest darlinges that might be, Ismael and faire Dalila, these two, With the loute Barnabas, I haue nothyng to do. Al was good, that these tidlynges do might, Sweare, lye, steale, scolde or fight: Cardes, dyce, kysse, clippe and so furth, All this our Mammy would take in good worth. Now sir, Dalila my daughter is dead of ye pockes And my son hanged in chaynes, &amp; waueth his lockes These newes wil I tel her, and the matter so frame That she shal be thyne owne mayster worldly shame, Hah ha ha. X?tippe commeth in Peace, peace, she comweth hereby, I spoke no word of her, no not I, Oh Mestres Xantippe, I can tell you nedes, The fayre wenche your dere daughter Dalila, Is dead of the pockes, taken at the stewes, And thy sonne Ismael, that preaty boy Whom I dare say you loued very well, Is hanged in chaynes, euer man can tell. Euery man saith thy daughter was a strong whore And thy sonne a strong thief, &amp; a murderer to It must nedes greue you wonderous sero, That they died so shamefully both two: Men wyl taunt you and mock you, for they say now The cause of their death, was euen verye you, X?tippe. I the cause of their death? She wold sowne worldly shame. Will ye sowne, the deuyl stop thy breath? Thou shalt die (I trow) with more shame I wyl get me hence out of the way, If the whore should dye, men would me blame, That I killed her, knaues should say. Exit. X?tippe. Alas alas, and weale away, I may curse the time that I was borne, Neuer woman had suche fortune, I dare say, Alas two of my chyldren be forlorne. My faire daughter Dalila is dead of the pockes, My dere sonne Ismael hanged vp in chaynes, Alas the wynd waueth his yelow lockes, It fleaeth my heart, and breaketh my braynes. Why should god punish &amp; plague me so sore? To se my children dye so shamefully, I wil neuer eate bread in this world more wt this knife wyl A sley my self by &amp; by. She wold stick her self a with a knife. Barnabas. Beware what ye do, fye mother fye, Wyl ye spyl your selfe for your own offence And seme for euer to exclude gods mercy, God doth punysh you for your negligence: Wherfore take his correction with pacience, And thanke him hertely, that of his godnes He bringeth you in knowledge of your trespas. For when my brother &amp; sister were of yonge age, You saw they were geuen to ydlenes and play, would apply no learnyng, but liue in outrage, And men complagned on them euery day. Ye winked at theyr faultes, and tidled them alway. By maintenaunce they grew to mischief and yll, So at last gods Iustice did them both spill. In that god preseruerued me, small thanke to you If god had not geuen me speciall grace, To auoyd euil, and do good, this is true, I had liued and dyed in as wretched case: As they did, for I had both suffraunce and space, But it is an olde prouerke, you haue herd it I think That god wyl haue se, shall not wynke. Yet in this we may al take comfort, They toke great repentaunce I heard say, And as for my sister, I am able to report, She lamented for her sinnes, to her dyng day: To repent and beleue I exorthed her alway, Before her death she beleued that god of his mercy For Christes sake, would saue her eternally. If you do euen so, ye nede not despaire, For god will frely remitte your sinnes all, Christe hath payed the raunsom, why shuld ye fear. To beleue this and do well, to god for grace call. All worldly cares let passe and fall, And thus comfort my father, I pray you hertely, I haue a lytle to say, I wyl come by and by. X?tippe goeth oute, Right gentle audience, by thys Interlude ye mayse How daungerous it is, for the frailtye of youth, Without good gouernaunce, to lyue at libertye, Suche chaunces as these, oft happen of truth Many miscary, it is the more ruth, By negligence of their elders, &amp; not taking payne, In tyme good learnyng &amp; qualities to attayne. Therfore exhortyng al parentes to be diligent, In bringing vp their children, yea to be circumspect Least they fall to euill, be not negligent, But chastice them before they be sore infect: Accept their well doing in yll them reiect, A yonge plant ye may platte &amp; bowe as ye wyll, Where it groweth strong, there wyll it abyde styll Euen so by chyldren, in theyr tender age, Ye may worke them like waxe, to your own entent But if ye suffer them longe to liue in outrage, They wil be sturdy and stiffe, and will not relent: O ye chyldren, let your tyme be well spent, Applye your learnyng and your elders obey, It wil be your profit an other day. Now, for the Quenes Royal maiestie let vs pray, He kneleth downe That god (in whose handes is ye hert of al Quenes,) Maye endue her highnes wt godly puissance alwaye that her grace may long raign &amp; prosper in al things In gods word &amp; iustice may giue light to al Quenes Let vs pray for the honorable councel &amp; nobilitie, He maketh curtesy and goeth out that they may alwayes co?sel in wisd? wt tr?quility, God saue the Quene, the Realme and cominaltie.
