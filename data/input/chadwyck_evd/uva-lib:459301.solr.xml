      <field name="fulltext">Ate Prologus. Condemned soule Ate, from lowest hell, And deadlie riuers of the infernall loue, Where bloodles ghostes in paines of endles date Fill ruthles cares with neuer ceasing cries, Beholde I come in place, and bring beside The bane of Troie: beholde the fatall frute Raught from the golden tree of Proserpine. Proude Troy must fall, so bidde the gods aboue, And statelie Iliums loftie towers be racet By conquering handes of the victorious foe: King Priams pallace waste with flaming fire, Whose thicke and foggie smoake peircing the skie, Must serue for messenger of sacrifice T'appeaze the anger of the angrie heeuens, And Priams younger sonne, the sheepeherde swaine, Paris th'unhappie organ of the Greekes. So loath and weerie of her heauie loade The Earth complaynes vnto the hellish prince, Surcharged with the burden that she nill sustaine. Th'unpartiall daughters of Necessitie Bin aydes in her sute: and so the twine That holdes olde Priams house, the threede of Troie Dame Atrops with knife in sunder cuttes. Done be the pleasure of the powers aboue, Whose hestes men must obey: and I my parte Performe in Ida vales: Lordinges adieu, Imposing silence for your taske, I ende, Till iust assemblie of the goddesses Make me beginne the Tragedie of Troie. Exit Ate cum aureo pomo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. SCENA I. Pan, Faunus, and Siluanus with their attendants enter to giue welcome to the goddesses: Pans sheepeherd hath a lambe, Faunus hunter hath a faune, Siluanus woodman with an oken bowe laden with acornes. Pan incipit. Pan. Silvanus, either Flora doth vs wronge, Or Faunus made vs tarrie all to longe, For by this morning mirth it shoulde appeere, The Muses or the goddesses be neer. Faun. My faune was nimble, Pan, and whipt apace, Twas happie that we caught him vp at last, The fairest fairest fawne in all the chace I wonder how the knaue could skip so fast: Pan. And I haue brought a twagger for the nonce. A bunting lambe: nay, pray you feele no bones. Beleeue me now, my cunning much I misse, If euer Pan felt fatter lambe then this. Sil. Sirs, you may boast your flockes &amp; herdes that bin both fresh &amp; faire, Yet hath Siluanus walkes ywis that stand in holsome ayre. And loe the honor of the woodes, the gallant Oken-bowe, Do I bestowe laden with Acornes &amp; with mast enough. Pan. Peace man for shame, shalt haue both lambes &amp; dames &amp; flockes and herdes &amp; al, And all my pipes to make the glee, we meete not now to brawle. Faun. Theres no such matter, Pan, we are all friendes assembled hether, To bid Queene Iuno and her pheeres most humblie welcome hether. Diana mistresse of our woodes, her presence will not want, Her curtesie to all her friendes we wot is nothing skant. SCENA. II. Pomona entereth with her fruite. Manentibus Pan cum reliquis. Pom. Yee Par, no farther yet, &amp; had the starte of me, Why then Pomona with her fruite comes time enough I see: Come on a while, with countrie store like friendes we enter forth, Thinkest Faunus that these goddesses will take our giftes in woorth. Faun. Yea doubtles, for shall tell thee dame, twere better giue a thing, A signe of loue, vnto a mightie person, or a king: Then to a rude and barbarous swayne but bad and baselie borne, For gentlie takes the gentleman that oft the clowne will scorne. Pan. Saist trulie Faunus, I my selfe haue giuen good tidie lambes, To Mercurie may saie to thee, to PhÅbus and to Ioue: When to a countrie mops forsooth, chaue offred all their dames, And pypt and prayed for little worth and raunged about the groue. Pom. God Pan that makes your flocke so thin, &amp; makes you looke so leane, To kisse in corners. Pan. wel-sed wech some other thing you meane. Pom. Yea iest it out till it goe alone, but maruell where we mysse Faire Flora all this merrie morne. Faun. some newes see where she is. SCENA. III. Flora entereth to the countrie gods. Pan. Flora well met, and for thy taken payne, Poore countrie gods city debters we remaine. Flor. Beleeue me, Pan, not all thy lambes and yoes, Nor, Faunus, all thy lustie buckes and does, (But that I am instructed well to knowe, What seruice to the hills and dales lowe,) Could haue enforced me to so straunge a toyle, Thus to enrich this gaudie gallant soyle. Faun. But tell me wench hast don't so trick in deede, That heauen it selfe may wonder at the deede. Flor. Not Iris in her pride and brauerie, Adornes her arche with such varietie: Nor doth the milke white way in frostie night, Appeare so faire and beautifull in sight. As done these fieldes, and groues, and sweetest bowres, Bestrewed and deckt with partie collord flowers. Alonge the bubling brookes &amp; siluer glyde, that at the bottome doth in sylence slyde, The waterie flowers and lillies on the bankes, Like blazing cometes burgen all in rankes. Vnder the Hathorne and the Poplar tree, Where sacred PhÅbe may delight to be: The Primerose and the purple Hyacinthe, The dayntie Uiolet and the holsome Minthe. The dooble Daisie, and the Couslip queene Of sommer floures, do ouer peere the greene: And rounde about the valley as ye passe, Yee may ne see for peeping flowers the grasse: That well the mightie Iono and the rest, May boldlie thinke to be a welcome guest On Ida hills, when to approue the thing, The queene of flowers prepares a second spring. Sil. Thou gentle Nymphe, what thankes shall we repaie To thee, that makest our fieldes and woodes so gaie? Flo. Siluanus, when it is thy hap to see, My workemanship, in portraying all the three, First stately Iuno with her porte and grace, Her roobes, her lawnes, her crounet and her mace: Would make thee muse this picture to beholde, Of yellow Oxstips bright as burnisht golde. Pom. A rare deuice, and Flora, well perdie, Did painte her yellow for her iellozie. Flo. Pallas in flowers of hue and collowers red, Her plumes, her helme, her launce, her Gorgous head, Her trayling tresses that hang flaring rounde, Of Iulie-flowers so graffed in the grounde, That trust me Sirs, who did the cunning see, Would at a blush suppose it to be shee. Pan. Good Flora, by my flocke twere verie good, To dight her all in red resembling blood. Flo. Faire Venus of sweete Violetts in blue. With other flowers infixt for chaunge of hue, Her plumes, her pendants, bracelets and her ringes, Her dayntie fan and twentie other thinges: Her lustie mantle wauing in the winde, And euerie part in collor and in kinde: And for her wreath of roses she nil dare, With Floras cunning counterfet compare So that what lvuing whight shall chaunce to see, These goddesses, eche placed in her degree, Portrayed by Floraes workemanshipe alone, Must say that Arte and nature met in one. Sil. A deintie draught to lay her downe in blue, The collour commonlie betokening true. Flo. This peece of worke compact with many a flowre, And well layde in at entraunce of the bowre, Where PhÅbe meanes to make this meeting royall, Haue I prepared to welcome them withall. Pom. And are they yet dismounted, Flora, saie: That we may wende to meete them one the way. Flo. That shall not neede: they are at hand by this, And the conductor of the trayne hight Rhanis. Iuno hath left her chariot longe agoe, And hath returned her Peacocks by her rainebowe. And brauelie as becommes the wife of Ioue, Doth honour by her presence to our groue. Faire Uenus shee hath let her sparrowes flie, To tende on her and make her melodie: Her turtles and her swannes vnyoked bee, And flicker neere her side for companie. Pallas hath set her Tygers loose to feede, Commaunding them to waite when shee hath neede. And Hitherward with proude and statelie pace, To doe vs honor in the Siluan chace They marche like to the pompe of heauen aboue, Iuno the wife and sister of king Ioue, The warlicke Pallas, and the Queene of loue. Pan. Pipe Pan for ioy and let thy sheepeherdes sing, Shall neuer age forget this memorable thing. Flo. Clio the sagest of the sisters nine, To do obseruaunce to this dame deuine, ladie of learning and of chyualrie, Is here aryued in faire assemble, And wandring vp and downe th'unbeaten wayes, Ringe through the wood sweete songes of Pallas prayse. Pom. Harke Flora, Faunus, here is melodie, A charme of birdes and more then ordinarie. An artificiall charme of birdes being harde within, Pan speakes. Pan. The sillie birdes make mirth, then shoulde we doe them wronge, Pomona, if we nil bestowe an Eccho to their songe. An Eccho to their song. The songe. A quier within and without. Gods. OIda, oIda, oIda happie hill, This honour done to oIda may it continue still. Mus. Yee countrie gods, that in this Ida wonne, Bring downe your giftes of welcome: For honor done to Ida. Gods. Beholde in signe of love we sing, And signes of ioyfull wel come bring. For honor done to Ida. Mus. The Muses giue you melodie to gratulate this chaunce, And PhÅbe cheife of siluan chace commaundes you all to daunce. Gods. The rounde in a circle our sportance must must be, da?ce. Holde handes in a hornepype all gallant in glee. Mus. Reuerence, reuerence, most humble reuerence. Gods. Most humble reuerence. SCENA. IIII. Pallas, Iuno, and Venus enter, Rhanis leading the way,Pan alone sings. The songe. The God of sheepeheardes and his mates, With countrie chere salutes your states: Faire, wise, and worthie as you bee, And thanke the gracious Ladies three, For honour done to Ida. The birdes singe. The songe being done, Iuno speakes. Iuno. Venus, what shall I saie, for though I be a dame deuine, This welcome and this melodie exceedes these wittes of mine. Ven. Beleeue me, Iuno, as I hight thee soueraigne of Loue, These rare delightes in pleasures passe the banquets of king Ioue. Pall. Then, Venus, I conclude, it easelie may be seene, That in her chaste and pleasant walkes fayre PhÅbe is a Queene. Rha. Diuine Pallas, and you sacred dames, Iuno and Venus, honoured by your names: Iuno, the wife and sister of kinge Ioue, Faire Venus, Ladie president of loue: If any entertaynment in this place, That can afford but homely, rude and base, It pleaze your godheads to accept in gree, That gratious thought our happinesse shalbe. My mistresse Dian, this right well I know, For loue that to this presence shee doth owe, Accountes more honoure done to her this day, Then euer whilom in these woods of Ida. And for our countrey gods, I dare bee bolde, They make such cheere, your presence to beholde, Such iouysaunce, such myrth and merryment, As nothing els their minde might more content: And that you doe beleeue it to bee so, Fayre goddesses, your louely lookes doe showe. It rests in fine, for to confirme my talke, Yee dayne to passe alonge to Dians walke: Where shee amonge her troupe of maydes attends The fayre aryuall of her vvelcome friends. Flora. And vvee vvill vvayte vvith all obseruance due, And doe iust honour to this heauenly crue. Pan. The god of sheepheardes, Iuno, ere thou goe, Intends a lambe on thee for to bestovve. Faun. Faunus, high raunger in Dianas chace, Presents a favvne to lady Uenus grace. Sylu. Syluanus giues to Pallas deitye, This gallant bovve raught from the Oken tree. Pom. To them that doth this honour to our fieldes, Her mellovve apples poore Pomona yeildes. Iuno. And gentle gods, these signes of your goodvvill Wee take in vvorth, and shall accept them still. Uen. And Flora, this to thee amonge the rest, Thy vvorkmanship comparinge vvith the best, Let it suffize thy cunninge to haue, To call kinge Ioue from forth his heauenly bovvre: Hadst thou a louer, Flora, credit mee, I thinke thou vvouldst beedecke him gallantly. But vvende vve on, and, Rhanis, leade the vvay, That kens the paynted pathes of pleasunt Ida. Exeunt omnes. SCENA. V. Paris and Oenone. Par. Oenone, while we bin disposed to walke, Tell me what shall be subiect of our talke: Thou hast a sorte of pretie tales in stoore, Dare saye no Nymphe in Ida woods hath more: Againe, beside thy sweete alluring face, In telling them thou hast a speciall grace Then preethee sweete, afforde some pretie thing, Some toie that from thy pleasaunt witte doth springe. Oen. Paris, my hartes contentment, and my choice, Vse thou thy pype, and I will vse my voyce, So shall thy iust request not be denyed. And time well spent and both be satisfied. Par. Well gentle Nymphe although thou do me wrong, That can ne tune my pype vnto a songe, Me list this once, Oenone, for thy sake, This idle taske ort me to vndertake. They sit vnder aires togeather. Oen. And whereon then shall be my Roundelay: For thou hast harde my stoore long since, dare say, Fabu. How Saturne did deuide his kingdome tho, la. 1. To Ioue, to Neptune, and to Dis below. 2 How mightie men made foule successes warre, Against the gods and state of Iupiter: 3 How Phorcias ympe that was so tricke and fayre, That tangled Neptune in her golden haire, Became a Gorgon for her lewde misdeede, A pretie fable Paris for to reade, A peece of cunnig trust me for the nonce, That wealth and beautie alter men to stoones. 4 Howe Salmacis resembling ydlenes, Turnes men to women all through wantonnes. 5 How Pluto raught Queene Ceres daughter thence, And what did followe of that Ioue offence. 6 Of Daphne turned into the laurell tree, That shevves a myror of virginitie. 7 How faire Narcissus tooting on his shade, Reproues disdayne, and tells how forme doth vade. 8 How cunning Philomelaes needle tells, What force in loue, what wit in sorrow dwelles. 9 What paynes vnhappie soules abyde in hell, They say because on earth they liued not well. 10 Ixions wheele, proude Tantals pyning woe. 11 Prometheus torment, and a many moe. 12 How Danaus daughters plie their endles taske. 13 What toyle the toyle of Sysiphus doth aske. All these are olde and knowne I knowe, yet if thou wilt haue anie, Chuse some of these, for trust me else Oenone hath not manie. Par. Nay what thou wilt: but sith my cunning not compares with thine, Beginne some Toy, that I can play vpon this pipe of mine. Oen. There is a pretie sonnet then, we call it Cupids curse: They that do chaunge olde loue for new, pray gods they chaunge for worse. The note is fine and quicke withall, the dittie will agree, Paris, With that same vowe of thine vpon our Poplar tree. Par. No better thing, begine it then, Oenone thou shalt see Our musicke, figure of the loue that growes twixt thee and me. They sing: and while Oenone singeth, he pypeth. Incipit Oenone. Faire and fayre and twise so faire, As fayre as any may be: Oenone. The fayrest sheepeherd on our grene, A loue for anie Ladie. Paris. Faire and faire and twise so fayre, As fayre as anie may bee: Thy loue is fayre for thee alone, And for no other Ladie. Oenone. My loue is faire, my loue is gaie, As fresh as bine the flowers in May, And of my loue my roundylaye, My merrie merrie merrie roundelaie Concludes with Cupids curse: They that do chaunge olde loue for newe, Pray Gods they chaunge for worse. Ambo simul. They that do chaunge, &amp;c. Oenone. Faire and faire, &amp;c, Paris. Faire and faire, &amp;c. Thy loue is faire &amp;c. Oenone. My loue can pype, my loue can sing, My loue can manie a pretie thing, And of his louelie prayses ring My merry merry roundelayes: Amen to Cupids curse: They that do chaunge, &amp;c. Paris. They that do chaunge, &amp;c. Ambo. Faire and fayre, &amp;c. Finis CamÅne. The songe being ended they rise, and Oenone speakes. Oen. Swete sheepeherd, for Oenones sake be cunning in this songe, And kepe thy loue, and loue thy choice, or else thou doest her wrong. Par. My vowe is made and witnessed, the Poplar will not starte, Nor shall the nymphe Oenones loue from forth my breathing hart. I will goe bring the one thy way, my flocke are here behinde, And I will haue a louers fee: they saie, vnkist, vnkinde. Exeunt ambo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCENA I. Venus, Iuno, Pallas. Ven. ex abrupto. But pray you tell me, Iuno, was it so, As Pallas tolde me here the tale of Eccho. Iun. Shee was a nympe indeede, as Pallas tels, A walker, such as in these thickets dwells: And as shee tolde what subtill iugling prankes Shee playde with Iuno, so she tolde her thankes: A tatling trull to come at euerie call, And now foresooth not tongue nor life at all. And though perhaps shee was a helpe to Ioue, And held me chat, while he might court his loue: Beleeue me, dames, I am of this opinion, He tooke but little pleasure in the minion. And what so ere his scapes haue bene beside, Dare saie for him a neuer strayed so wyde: A louely nutbrowne lasse, or lustie trull, Haue power perhaps to make a god a bull. Ven. Gramercie gentle Iuno for that iest, Ifaith that item was worth all the rest. Pal. No matter, Venus, how so ere you skorne, My father Ioue at that time ware the horne. Iun. Had euerie wanton god aboue, Venus, not better lucke, Then heauen would be a pleasaunt parcke, &amp; Mars a lustie bucke. Ven. Tut Mars hath hornes to butte withall although no bull a showes, A neuer needes to maske in nets, a feares no iellous froes. Iun. Forsooth the better is his turne, for if a speake to loude, Must finde some shifte to shadowe him, a net, or else a cloude. Pal. No more of this, fayre goddesses, vnrip not so your shames, To stand all naked to the world, that bene such heauenly dames. Iun. Nay, Pallas, that's a common tricke with Venus well we knowe, And all the Gods in heauen haue seene her naked, long agoe. Ven. And then she was so faire and bright, and louelie and so trim, As Mars is but for Venus tooth, and shee will sporte with him. And but me list not here to make comparison with Ioue, Mars is no raunger, Iuno, he in euerie open groue. Pal. To much of this: we wander farre, the skies begine to skowle, Retire we to Dianas bowre, the weather will be soule. The storme being past of thunder &amp; lightning, &amp; Ate hauing tr?dled the ball into place, crying Fatum Troie, Iuno taketh the bal vp &amp; speaketh. Iun. Pallas, the storme is past and gon, and PhÅbus cleares the skies, And loe, beholde a ball of golde, a faire and worthie prize. Ven. This posie wils, the apple to the fayrest giuen be, Then is it mine: for Venus hight the fayrest of the three. Pal. The fayrest here as fayre is ment, am I, ye do me wronge: And if the fayrest haue it must, to me it doth belong Iun. Then Iuno may it not enioy, so euery one sayes no, But I will proue my selfe the fayrest, er I lose it so. They reade the posie. The breyfe is this, Detur PulcherrimÃ¦ Let this vnto the fayrest gyven bee, The fayrest of the three and I am shee. Pallas reades. Detur PulcherrimÃ¦. Let this vnto the fayrest gyuen be, The fayrest of the three, and I am shee. Venus reades. Detur PulcherrimÃ¦. Let this vnto the fayrest giuen bee The fayrest of the thre, and I am shee. Iun. My face is fayre, but yet the maiestie That all the gods in heauen haue seene in me, Haue made them chuse me of the Planetes seaven; To bee the wyfe of Ioue, and Queene of heauen. Yf then this prize be but bequeathed to beautye, The only shee that wins this prize am I. Ven. That Venus is the fayrest, this dothe proue, That Venus is the louely Queen of loue. The name of Venus is in deede but bautye, And men me fayrest call, per excellencye. Yf then this prize be but bequeathed to beautye, The only shee that wins this prize, am I. Pall. To stand on tearmes of beautye as yow take it, Beeleue me, Ladies, is but to mystake it: The beautye that this subtill prize must vvin, No outvvarde beautye highte, but dvvels vvithin. And syftest as yovv please, and yovv shall finde, This beautye, is the beautye of the minde. This fayrenes, Vertue highte, in generall, That many braunches hathe in speciall: This beauty vvysdom hight, vvhereof am I, By heauen appointed, goddesse vvorthelye. And looke hovv muche the minde, the better parte, Doth ouerpasse the bodye in deserte: So much the mistris of those guyfts devine, Excells thy beautie, and that state of thine. Then yf this prize bee thus bequeathed to beautye, The only she that vvins this prize, am I. Ven. Nay, Pallas, by your leaue, yovv vvander cleane, Wee must not conster heereof as yovv meane: But take the sense as it is plainly ment, And let the fayrest hate, I am content. Pal. Our reasons wilbe infinite, I trowe, Vnles vnto some other point we grow. For first heres none mee thinkes disposed to yeelde, And none but will with wordes maintaine the fielde. Iun. Then if you will to auoyde a tedious grudge, Refer it to the sentence of a iudge, Who ere he be that commeth next in place, Let him bestowe the ball, and ende the case. Uen. So can it not go wronge with me not at al. Pal. I am agreed how euer it befall. And yet by common doome, so may it bee, I may be sayde the fayrest of the three. Iun. Then yonder loe that sheepeherde swaine is he, That must be vmpter in this controuersie. SCENA II. Paris alone. Manentibus Pal. Iunone, Venere. Ven. Iuno, in happie time, I do accept the man, It seemeth by his lookes, some skill of loue he can. Par. The nymphe is gone, and I all solitarie, Must wend to tend my charge, opprest with melancholy. This day (or else me fayles my sheepeherdes skill) Will tide me passing good, or passing ill. Iun. Sheepeherd, abash not, though, at sudden thus, Thou be aryued by ignorance among vs, Not earthlie but deuine, and goddesses all three, Iuno, Pallas, Venus, these our titles be. Nor feare to speake, for reuerence of the place, Chosen to ende a harde and doubtfull case. This apple loe (nor aske thou whence it came) Is to be giuen vnto the fayrest dame. And fayrest is, nor shee, nor shee, but shee, Whom, sheepeherd, thou shalt fayrest name to be. This is thy charge, fulfill without offence, And shee that winnes shall giue thee recompence. Pal. Dreade not to speake for we haue chosen thee, Sith in this case, we can no iudges be. Ven. And, sheepeherd, say that I the fayrest ame, And thou shalt win good guerdon for the same. Iun. Nay, shepherde, looke vppon my stately grace, Because the pompe that longs to Iunoes mace, They mayst not see: and thincke Queene Iunoes name, To vvhome olde shepherds title vvorkes of fame, Is mightye, and may easily suffize, At Phebus hande to gaine a golden prize. And for thy meede, sythe I ame Queene of riches, Shepherde, I vvill revvarde thee vvith greate monarchies, Empires, and kingdomes, heapes of massye golde, Scepters and diadems, curious to beholde, Riche robes, of sumpteous vvorkmanship and cost, And thovvsand thinges vvhereof I make no boast The moulde vvhereon thovve treadest shall be of Tagus sandes, And Xanthus shall runne liquid golde for the to vvash thy handes: And yf thou lyke to tend thy flock, and not from them to flie, Their fleeces shalbe curled gold to please their masters eye. And last, to sett thy harte one fire, gyue this one fruite to me, And, shepherd, lo this Tree of Golde vvill I bestovve on thee. IVNOES SHOWE. Heereuppon did rise a Tree of gold laden with Diadems &amp; Crownes of golde.

The Tree sinketh. Pall. Me Ivst not tempt thee vvith decayinge vvealthe, Which is embaset by vvant of lusty healthe: But yf thou haue a minde to fly aboue, Ycrovvned vvith fame neere to the feate of Ioue: Yf thou aspire to vvysdomes vvorthines. Where of thovv mayst not see the brightnes Yf thou desyre honor of chyuallrye, To bee renouned for happy victorie, To fighte it out, and in the clumpaine feilde, To shrovvde thee vnder pallas vvarlike sheilde, To praunce on barbed steedes, this honor loe, My selfe for guerdon shall on thee bestowe. And for encouragement, that thou mayst see, What famous knightes dame Pallas warriors be, Beholde in Pallas honour here they come, Marching alonge with sounde of thundring drom. PALLAS SHOW.

And if the fayrest face deserue the ball, Fayre Venus, Ladyes, beares it from yee all. Ven. And in this ball dothe Venus more delight, Then in her louely boy faire Cupids sighte. Come shepherd comme, sweete Venus is thy frend, No matter how thow other gods offend. Venus taketh paris with her. Exeunt. Iun.

This beinge so, it rests he go from hence, Before the gods to answere his offence. Ven. What tale is this, dothe Iuno and her mate Pursue this shepherde with such deadly hate.

Bring forth the man of Troie that he may heare, Whereof he is to be araigned here. Nep. Lo where a comes prepared to pleade his case, vnder conduct of louely Venus grace. Mer. I haue not seene a more alluring boy. Apol. So beautie hight the wracke of Priams Troy. The gods being set in Dianaes bower: Inno, Pallas, Diana, Uenus and Paris stand on sides before them. Ven. Loe sacred Ioue, at Iunoes proude complaynte, As erst I gaue my pledge to Mercurie, I bring the man whom he did late attaint, To aunswere his inditement orderlie: And craue this grace of this immortall senate, That yee allowe the man his aduocate. Pal. That may not be, the lawes of heauen denie, A man to pleade or answere by atturney. Ven. Pallas, thy doome is all too peremptorie. Apol. Venus, that fauour is denyed him flatlie, He is a man and therefore by our lawes, Him selfe, without his ayd, must plead his cause. Ven. Then bashe not, sheepeherde, in so good a case, And friendes thou hast as well as foes in place. Iun. Why, Mercurie, why doe yee not indite him. Ven. Softe gentle, Iuno, I pray you do not bite him. Iun. Nay, gods, I troe you are like to haue great silence, Vnles this parrot be commaunded hence. Iou. Venus, forbeare, be still: speake, Mercurie. Ven. If Iuno iangle, Venus will replie. Mer. Paris, king Priams sonne, thou art araygned of parciallitie, Of sentence partiall and vniust, for that without indifferencie, Beyonde desert or merit far, as thine accusers say, From them, to Lady Venus here, thou gauest the pryze away. What is thine answere? Paris oration to the Councell of the gods. Sacred and iust, thou great and dreadfull Ioue, And you thrise reuerende powers, whom loue nor hate, May wrest awry, if this to me a man, This fortune fatall bee, that I must pleade, For safe excusall of my giltles thought, The honour more makes my mishap the lesse, That I a man must pleade before the gods, Gratious forbearers of the worldes amisse, For her, whose beautie how it hath enticet, This heauenly senate may with me auer. But sith nor that, nor this may doe me boote, And for my selfe, my selfe must speaker bee, A mortall man, amidst this heauenlie presence. Let me not shape a longe defence, to them, That ben beholders of my giltles thoughtes. Then for the deede, that I may not denie, Wherein consists the full of myne offence, I did vpon commaunde: if then I erde, I did no more then to a man belong'd. And if in verdit of their formes deuine, My dazled eye did swarue or surfet more On Venus face, then anie face of theirs: It was no partiall fault, but fault of his Belike, whose eysight not so perfect was, As might decerne the brightnes of the rest. And if it were permitted vnto men (Ye gods) to parle with your secret thoughtes, There ben that sit vpon that sacred seate, That woulde with Paris erre in Venus prayse. But let me cease to speake of errour here: Sith what my hande, the organ of my harte, Did giue with good agreement of myne eye, My tongue is voyde with processe to maintaine. Plut. A iolly sheepeherde, wise and eloquent. Par. First then arraign'de of parciallitie. Paris replyes vnguiltie of the fact His reason is, because he knewe no more Faire Uenus Ceston, then dame Iunoes mace, Nor neuer sawe wise Pallas cristall shielde. Then as I looked I loued and likte attonce, And as it was referd from them to me, To giue the pryze to her, whose beautie best My fancie did commend, so did I prayse And iudge as might my dazled eye decerne. Nep. A peece of art, that, cunninglie pardie, Refers the blame to weakenes of his eye. Par. Now (for I must adde reason for my deede) Why Uenus rather pleased me of the three: First, in the intrayles of my mortall eares, The question standing vpon beauties blaze, The name of her that height the queene of loue, My thought in beautie should not be exceld. Had it bene destyned to maiestie, (Yet will I not rob Uenus of her grace.) Then stately Iuno might haue borne the ball. Had it to wisedome bine entituled, My humaine wit had giuen it Pallas then. But sith vnto the fayrest of the three, That power, that threw it for my farther ill, Did dedicate this ball: and safest durst My sheepeherdes skill aduenture, as I thought, To iudge of forme and beautie, rather then Of Iunos state, or Pallas worthynes, That learnd token the fayrest of the flocke, And praysed beautie but by natures ayme: Behold to Venus Paris gaue this fruite, A dayesman chosen there by full consent, And heauenly powers should not repent their deedes. Where it is sayde, beyonde desert of hers, I honoured Uenus with this golden prize: (Yee gods) alas what can a mortall man Decerne, betwixt the sacred guiftes of heauen. Or, if I may with reuerence reason thus: Suppose I gaue, and iudgd corruptly then, For hope of that, that best did please my thought, This apple not for beauties prayse alone: I might offende, sithe I was pardoned, And tempted, more then euer creature was, With wealth, with beautie and with chiualrie: And so preferred beautie before them all, The thing that hath enchaunted heauen it selfe. And for the one, contentment is my wealth: A shell of salte will serue a sheepeherde swayne, A slender banquet in a homely skrip, And water running from the siluer spring. For armes, they dreade no foes that sit so lowe, A thorne can keepe the wind from off my backe, A sheepe-coate thatcht, a sheepherdes pallace hight. Of tragicke Muses sheepeherdes con no skill, Enough is them, if Cupid ben displeased, To sing his prayse on slender oten pipe. And thus, thryse reuerend, haue I tolde my tale, And craue the torment of my guiltles soule To be measured by my faultles thought. If warlicke Pallas, or the queene of heauen Sue to reuerse my sentence by appeale, Be it as please your maiesties deuine, The wronge, the hurte not mine, if anie be, But hers whose beautie claymed the prize of me. Paris hauing ended, Iupiter speaketh. Iup. Venus, withdrawe your sheepeherde for aspace, Till he againe be called for into place. Exeunt Venus &amp; Paris. Iuno, what will ye after this reply But doome with sentence of indifferencie. And if you will but iustice in the cause, The man must quited be by heauens lawes. Iun. Yea gentle Ioue, when Iunoes sutes are mooued, Then heauen may see how well shee is beloued. Apol. But, Madam, fits it maiestie deuine, In anie sorte from iustice to decline? Pal. Whether the man be guiltie yea or noe, That doth not hinder our appeale, I troe? Iun. PhÅbus, I wot, amid this heauenly crue, There be that haue to say as well as you Apol. And Iuno, I with them, and they with me, In lawe and right, must needefully agree: Pal. I graunt ye may agree, but be content To doubt vpon regarde of your agrement. Plu. And if yee markt, the man in his defence. Saide thereof as a might with reuerence. Vul. And did yee verie well I promise yee. Inn. No doubt, sir, you could note it cunninglie. Sat. Well, Iuno, if ye will appeale yee may, But first dispatch the sheepeherde hence away. Mar. Then Vulcans dame is like to haue the wronge. Iun. And that in passion doth to Mars belonge. Iup. Call Uenus and the sheepeherde in againe. Bac. And rid the man that he may knowe his payne. Apol. His payne, his payne, his neuer dying payne, A cause to make a many moe complaine. Mercurie bringeth in Uenus and Paris. Iup. Sheepeherd, thou hast ben harde with equitie and law, And for thy stars do thee to other calling drawe, We here dismisse thee hence, by order of our senate: Goe take thy way to Troie, and there abide thy fate. Ven. Sweete shepherde, with such luck in loue while thow dost liue, As may the Queene of Loue to any Louer giue. Par. My lucke is losse howe ere my loue do speede, I feare me Paris shall but rue his deede. Paris exit. Apo. From Ida woods now wends the shepherds boye, That in his bosome caries fire to Troy. Iup. Venus, these Ladies do appeale yow see, And that they may appeale the gods agree, It resteth then that yow be well content To stande in this vnto our finall iudgment: And if king Priams sonne did well in this, The Lawe of heauen will not leade amysse. Ven. But, sacred Iupiter, might thy daughter chuse, Shee might with reason this appeale refuse: Yet, if they bee vnmoued in their shames, Bee it a staine and blemysh to their names: A deede to far vnworthy of the place, Vnworthy Pallas Launce, or Iunoes mace: And, if to beauty it bequeathed be, I doubte not but it will returne to me. She layeth Down the ball. Pall. Venus, there is no more adoe then soe, It restethe where the gods doe it bestowe. Nep. But, Ladies, vnder fauour of your rage, How ere it be, yow play vppon the vauntage. Iup. Then dames, that wee more freely may debate, And heere th'indifferent sentence of this senate, Withdrawe yow from this presence for a space, Till wee haue throughly questioned of the cace: Dian shalbe your guyde, not shall yow neede Your selues t'enquire how things do heere succeede, Wee will, as wee resolue giue yow to knowe, By generall doome, how euery thinge doth goe. Dia. Thy will, my wish, faire Ladies, will yee wende? Iuno Beshrewe her whome this sentence doth offende. Ven. Now Ioue be iust, and gods you that bee Venus freindes, Yf yow haue ever donne her wronge, then may yow make amends. Manent Dij. Exeunt Diana, Pallas, Iuno, Venus. Iup. Venus is faire, Pallas and Iuno toe. Vulc But tell me now without some more adoe, Who is the fairest shee, and do not flatter. Plu. Vulcan, vppon comparison hanges all the matter: That donne the quarrell and the stryfe were ended. Mar. Because tis knowne, the quarrell is pretended. Vul. Mars, you haue reason for your speeche perdie: My dame (I troe) is fairest in your eye. Mar. Or (Vulcan) I shold do her doble wronge. Sat. About a toy wee tary heere so longe. Gyue it by voices, voices giue the odds: A trifle so to troble all the gods. Nep. Beleue me, Saturne, be it so for me. Bac. For me. Pluto. for me Mars. for me, yf Ioue agre. Mer. And gentle gods, I am indifferent: But then I knowe whoose lykely to be shent. Ap. Thryse reuerend gods, and thow immortall Ioue. Yf PhÅbus may, as him doth much behoue, Be licensed, accordinge to our Lawes, To speake vprightly in this doubted cause, (Sythe womens witts woorke mens vnceasinge woes) To make them freindes, that now bin frendles foes, And peace to keepe with them, with vs, and all That make their title to this golden ball: (Nor thincke yee gods my speeche doth derogate From sacred powre of this immortall senate,) Refer this sentence where it doth belonge, In this say I fayre PhÅbe hathe the wronge. Not that (I meane) her beautye beares the prize: But that the holly Lawe of heauen denies, One god to medle in an others powre. And this befell so neere Dianas bowre, As for thappeazinge this vnplesant grudge, (In my conceyte) shee hight the fittest iudge. Yf Ioue comptroll not Plutoes hell with charmes, Yf Mars haue souraigne powre to manage armes: Yf Bacchus beare no rule in Neptune sea Not Vulcans fire dothe Saturnes sythe obay: Suppresse not then, 'gainst lawe and equitie, Dianas power in her owne territorie: Whose regiment, amid her sacred bowers, As proper height as anie rule of yours. Well may we so wipe all the speeche awaie, That Pallas, Iuno, Venus hath to say, And aunswere that by iustice of our lawes, We were not suffred to conclude the cause. And this to me most egall doome appeares, A woman to be iudge amonge her pheeres. Mer. Apollo hath founde out the onely meane, To rid the blame from vs and trouble cleane. Vul. We are beholding to his sacred wit. Iup. I can commend and well allow of it. And so deriue the matter from vs all, That Dian haue the giuing of the ball. Vul. So Ioue may clearly excuse him in the case, Where Iuno else woulde chide and braule apace. All they rise and goe foorth. Mer. And now, it were some cunning to deuine, To whom Diana will this pryze resigne. Vul. Suffizeth me, it shall be none of mine. Bac. Uulcan, though thou be blacke, thart nothing fine. Vul. Goe bathe thee, Bacchus, in a tub of wine, The balls as likely to be mine as thine. Exeunt omnes: explicit. Act. 4.</field>

Lo, Ladyes, farre beyonde my hope and will, you see, This thankles office is imposd to me: Wherein if you will rest aswell content, As Dian wil be iudge indifferent, My egall doome shall none of you offende, And of this quarrell make a finall ende: And therefore, whether you be liefe of loath, Confirme your promise with some sacred othe. Pal. PhÅbe, chiefe Mistresse of this siluan chace, Whom gods haue chosen to conclude the case, That yet in ballance vndecyded lies. Touching bestowing of this golden prize. I giue my promise and mine othe withall, By Stix, by heauens power imperiall, By all that longes to Pallas deytie, Her shilde, her launce, ensignes of chiuallrie, Her sacred wreath of Oliue, and of Baye, Her crested helme, and else what Pallas may, That where so ere this ball of purest golde, That chast Diana here in hande doth holde, Vnpartially her wisedome shall bestowe, Without mislike or quarrell any moe, Pallas shall rest content and satisfied, And say the best desert doth there abide. Iun. And here I promise and protest withall, By Stix, by heauens power imperiall, By all that longes to Iunoes deitie, Her crowne, her mace, ensignes of maiestie: Her spotles mariage-rites, her league diuine, And by that holy name of Proserpine, That wheresoere, this ball of purest golde, That chast Diana here in hande doth holde, Vnpartially her wisedome shall bestowe, Without mislike or quarrell anie moe, Iuno shall rest content and satisfied, And say the best desert doth there abyde. Ven. And louely PhÅbe, for I knowe thy dome Wilbe no other then shall thee become, Beholde I take thy daintie hande to kisse, And with my solemne othe confirme my promise, By Stix, by Ioues immortall emperie, By Cupids bowe, by Venus mirtle-tree, By Vulcans gifte, my Ceston, and my fan, By this red rose, whose colour first began, When erst my wanton boy (the more his blame) Did drawe his bowe awry and hurt his dame, By all the honour and the sacrifice, That from CithÃ¦ron and from Paphos rise: The conclusion aboue. That wheresoere, &amp;c. Venus shall rest, &amp;c. vt supra. Diana hauing taken their othes speaketh. Diana describeth the Nymphe Eliza a figure of the Queene. Dian. It is enough, and goddesses attende: There wons within these pleasaunt shady woods, Where neither storme nor Suns distemperature Haue power to hurte by cruell heate or colde, Vnder the clymate of the milder heauen, Where seldome lights Ioues angrie thunderbolt, For fauour of that soueraygne earthly peere: Where whystling windes make musick 'mong the trees, Far from disturbance of our countrie gods, Amids the Cypres springes a gratious Nymphe, That honour Dian for her chastitie, And likes the labours well of PhÅbes groues: The place Elizium hight, and of the place, Her name that gouernes there Eliza is, A kingdome that may well compare with mine. An auncient seat of kinges, a seconde Troie, Ycompast rounde with a commodious sea: Her people are ycleeped Angeli, Or if I misse a lettre is the most. She giueth lawes of iustice and of peace, And on her heade as fits her fortune best, She weares a wreath of laurell, golde, and palme: Her robes of purple and of scarlet die, Her vayle of white, as best befits a mayde. Her auncestors liue in the house of fame, Shee giueth armes of happie victorie, And flowers to decke her lyons crowned with golde. This peereles nymphe whom heauen and earth beloues, This Paragon, this onely this is shee, In whom do meete so manie giftes in one, On whom our countrie gods so often gaze, In honour of whose name the Muses singe. In state Queene Iunos peere, for power in armes, And vertues of the minde Mineruaes mate. As fayre and louely as the queene of loue: As chast as Dian in her chast desires. The same is shee, if PhÅbe doe no wronge, To whom this ball in merit doth belonge. Pal. If this be shee whom some Zabeta call, To whom thy wisedome well bequeathes the ball I can remember at her day of birthe, Howe Flora with her flowers strewed the Earth, How euerie power with heauenlie maiestie, In person honored that solemnitie. Iun. The louely graces were not farre away, They threw their balme for triumph of the day. Ven. The fates against their kinde beganne a cheerefull songe, And vowed her life with fauour to prolonge. Then first gan Cupids eysight wexen dim, Belike Elisas beautie blinded him. To this fayre Nymphe, not earthly but deuine: Contents it me my honour to resigne. Pal. To this fayre Queene so beautifull and wise, Pallas bequeathes her title in the prize. Iun. To her whom Iunoes lookes so well become, The queene of heauen yeildes at PhÅbus doome. And glad I am Diana found the arte, Without offence so well to please desart. Dian. Then marke my tale the vsuall time is nie, When wont the dames of life and destinie, In robes of cheerfull collours to repayre, To this renowned Queene so wise and fayre, With pleasaunt songes this peereles nimphe to greete, Clotho layes downe her distaffe at her feete. And Lachesis doth pull the threed at length, The thirde with fauour giues it stuffe and strength And for contrarie kinde affordes her leaue, As her best likes her web of life to weaue This time we will attend, and in the meane while With some sweete songe the tediousnes beguile. The Musicke sounde and the Nimphes within singe or solfa with voyces and instrumentes awhile. Then enter Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos singing as followeth: The state being in place. The songe. Cloth.
