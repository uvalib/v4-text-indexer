      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, WRITTEN BY CHARLES PHILLIPS, ESQ. SPOKEN BY MR. EGERTON. When erst in Eden's solitary bowers, The primal Man beheld his world of flowers, Eternal sunshine tinged the glorious sky, Alternate beauties wooed his wandering eye; While infant Love, waving its odorous wing, Woke the wild spirit of the breathing Spring. Yet still through Paradise he restless strayed, Its bower was songless, and its sun was shade; E'en as the Bard of Albany has sung, In strains that live for age, and yet are young, Creation bloom'd, a decorated wild,â It was not Paradiseâtill Woman smiled. Fair on his view the Paragon arose, Source of his bliss, and solace of his woes. By bounteous Heaven ordain'd to sooth his fall, And sole survive, a recompense for all. Who has not felt her chaste and charmed power Beguile his sad, and raise his raptur'd hour? If such there beâOh! let him bend his sight Far from the hallowed vision of to-night. To-night, our Bard, in lovely woman's cause, Alone from manly bosoms asks applause; From British bosoms asks, without a fear, Assured that such a cause is sacred here. And you, ye fair, see young Evadne prove Her vestal honour, and her plighted love; See her, the light and joy of every eye, Veil all her charms in spotless chastity; And, 'mid the fires and phantasies of youth, Turn strong temptations to the cause of truth! Oh! may each maid Evadne's virtue share, With heart as faithful though with form less fair. You, too, who hope ambition's height to climb, Toiling to fortune through the maze of crime, Behold, as in the daring âfool of Crete.â Of such design, the lesson, and the fate: Behold the wing that lifts it to the skies Melt in the sun to which it sought to rise. Such is the strain by which the moral bard Seeks from a moral people his reward: Seeks in simplicity, without one aid From scenic pomp, or pasteboard cavalcade. Britons, be just, and as our âStatueâ stands, Like Memnon's image from its master's hands, With one bright ray illume the sculptured toil, And bid it breatheâthe creature of your smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âThe Palace of the King of Naples. The King, Spalatro, and ten Courtiers, two Banners, and six Guards, discovered. King. Didst say the Marquis of Colonna prays Admission to our presence? Spal. Aye, my liege, He stands in the anti-chamber, with a brow As stern as e'er was knitted in the folds Of ranc'rous discontent. King. I have noted oft (Comes forward.) His absence from the court, the which I deem His envy of our true Ludovico. Spal. Deem it no little benefit, my liege; His deep and murky smile, his gather'd arms, In whose close pride he folds himselfâhis raw And pithy apothegms of scorn have made him Our laughter and our hatred; we are all Grown weary of this new Diogenes, Who rolls his hard and new philosophy Against all innocent usage of the court. King. We must not bid him henceâhe has a sisterâ Spal. The fair Evadne!â King. Fairer than the morn; Who has not seen her, knows of beauty less Than blind men of Aurora. For her sake We give him ample scope, and we are glad He comes to visit us. Col. (Without, L. H.) I'll hear no more. Colonna does not often importune With his unwelcome presence. Let me passâ For once I must be heard. Enter Two Courtiers and Colonna, L. H. My liege!â 1st Court. Hold back! What right hast thou to rush before the sight Of sacred royalty? Col. The right that all Good subjects ought to haveâto do him service. My liegeâ(Courtiers retire L. H. and Spalatro crosses behind to R. H.) King. You are welcomeâ And would you had brought your lovely sister too. Col. My sister, did you say? My sister, sir? She is not fit for courts; she would be called (For she has something left of nature still) A simple creature here; She is not fit for courts, and I have hope She never will: but let it passâI come To implore a favour of you. King. Whatsoe'er Colonna prays, sure cannot be refus'd. Col. The favour that I ask is one, my liege, That princes often find it hard to grant. 'Tis simply thisâthat you will hear the truth. King. Proceed, and play the monitor, my lord. Col. I see your courtiers here do stand amazed. Of them I first would speakâThere is not one Of this wide troop of glittering parasites, That circle you, but in soul Is your base foe. These smilers here, my liege,â These sweet melodious flatterers, my liege,â That flourish on the flexibility Of their soft countenances,âare the vermin That haunt a prince's ear with the false buzz Of villanous assentation.âThese are they Who from your mind have flouted every thought Of the great weal of the people. These are they Who from your ears have shut the public cry, And with the poisoned gales of flattery Create around you a foul atmosphere Of unresounding denseness, thro' the which Their loud complaints cannot reverberate, And perish ere they reach you. King. Who complains,â Who dares complain of us? Col. All dare complain Behind youâI before you. Do not think Because you load your people with the weight Of camels, they possess the camel's patience. A deep groan labours in the nation's heart: The very calm and stillness of the day Gives augury of the earthquake. All without Is as the marble smooth, and all within Is rotten as the carcase it contains; Tho' ruin knock not at the palace-gate, Yet will the palace-gate unfold itself To ruin's felt-shod tread. King. (Aside.) Insolent villain! Col. Your gorgeous banquetsâyour luxuriesâyour pomps, Your palaces, and all the sumptuousness Of painted royalty will melt away, As in a theatre the glittering scene Doth vanish with the shifter's magic hand, And the mock pageant perishes. My liege, A single virtuous action hath more worth Than all the pyramids, and glory writes A more enduring epitaph upon One generous deed, than the sarcophagus In which Sesostris meant to sleep. Spal. (Coming forward.) Forbear! It is a subject's duty to arrest Thy rash and blasphemous speech. King. Let him speak onâ The monarch who can listen to Colonna, Is not the worthless tyrant he would make me. (Spalatro retires.) Col. I deem not you that tyrantâif I didâ No!âNature framing you, did kindly mean, And o'er your heart hath sprinkled many drops Of her best charities. But you are led From virtue and from wisdom far away, By men whose every look's a lieâwhose hearts Are a large heap of cankers, and of whom The chief is a rank traitor! King. Traitor! whom meanest thou? Col. Your favourite, your minister, my liege. That smooth-faced hypocriteâthatâ King. Here he comes! Col. It is the traitor's selfâI am glad of it, That to his face I may confront.â Enter Ludovico, R. H.âhe advances rapidly to the king. Lud. My liege, I hasten to your presence, to inform youâ Colonna here! (Starting.) Col. The sameâColonna's here! And if you wish to learn his theme of speech, Learn that he spoke of treason and of you. Lud. Did I not stand before the hallowed eye Of majesty, I would teach thee with my sword How to reform thy phraseâBut I am now In my king's presence, and with awe-struck soul, As if within religion's peaceful shrine, Humbly I bend before him. What, my liege, Hath this professor of austerity, And practiser of slander, uttered Against your servant's honour? King. He hath called youâ Col. A traitor! and I warn you to beware Of the false viper nurtured in your heart. He has filled the city with a band of men, By fell allegiance sworn unto himself. There are a thousand ruffians at his word Prepared to cut our throats. The city swarms With murderers' faces, and tho' treason now Moves like a muffled dwarf, 'twill speedily Swell to a blood-robed giant!âIf my liege, What I have said doth not unfilm your eye, 'Twere vain to tell you more. I have said, my liege, And tried to interrupt security Upon her purple cushionâhe, perhaps, Will find some drowsy syrup to lay down Her opening eye-lids into sleep again, And call back slumber with a lullaby Of sweetest adulation.âFare you well! Lud. Hold back! Col. Not for your summons, my good lord The courtly air doth not agree with me, And I respire it painfully. My lord, Hear my last wordsâBeware, Ludovico! Lud. Villain, come back! Col. I wear a sword, my lord. [Exit, L. H. Lud. He flies before meâand the sight of him He dares accuse, came like the morning sun On the night-walking enemy of mankind, That shrinks before the day-lightâyes, he fled, And I would straight pursue him, and send back, On my sword's point, his falsehoods to his heartâ But that I here before the assembled court Would vindicate myselfâa traitor!âwho In any action of Ludovico Finds echo to that word? King. I cannot think Thou hast repaid me with ingratitude. Lud. I do not love to make a boisterous boast Of my past services, and marshal forth In glittering array the benefit That I have done my sovereignâwhat I did Was but my duty. Yet would I inquire If he who has fought your battles, and hath made A very thrall of victoryâwho oft Has back to Naples from the field of fight, Led your triumphant armies,â He whose hand Hath lined the oppressive diadem with down, And ta'en its pressure from the golden roundâ If he whose cheek hath at the midnight lamp Grown pale with study of his prince's weal Is like to be a traitor?âwho, my liege, Hath often like the daylight's god transpierced The hydra-headed monster of rebellion, And streched it bleeding at your feet? who oft Hath from the infuriate people exorcised The talking dÃ¦mon, âliberty,â and choaked The voice of clamorous demagogues?âI dare To tell you 'twas Ludovico! King. It was. Lud. Who calls me traitor? He whose breath doth taint Whate'er it blows uponâheâ But ask yourself, my lord, if I be mad? For were I that, that he would make Ludovico, The cells of frenzy, not the scaffold's plank, Would best beseem my treason. In your love My fortunes grow and flourish unto heaven; And I should win by treason but the load Of the world's execration, while the fierce And ravenous vulture of remorse would tear The vitals of my soul, and make my heart Its black immortal banquet! I a traitor! At first, I only meant to scorn. But now, The bursting passion hath o'ermastered me, And my voice choaks in anguish! Oh, my liege, Your giving audience to this rancourous man, Who envies me the greatness of your smile, Hath done me wrong, and stabs me thro' and thro'. A traitor!âyour Ludovico! King. My lord. Lud. (Kneels.) Here is my heart! If you have any mercy, Strike thro' that heart, and as the blood flows forth, Drown your suspicions in the purple stream. King. Arise, Ludovico, and do not think I have harboured in my breast a single thought That could dishonour thee. (Raises and embraces him.) Lud. My royal master! The power of gratitude mounts from my heart, And rushes to mine eyes, that are too apt To play the woman with me. See, they are fallingâ Oh! let them not profane your sacred cheek, But bathe my prince's feet. King. Ludovico, We have wrong'd thee, not by doubt, But by our sufferance of Colonna's daringâ Whom from my sight into the dungeon's depth I had flung, but that I hopeâLet us apartâ (Draws Ludovico aside in front, L. H.) But that I hope, Ludovico, that yet I may possess me of his sister's charms. Lud. There you have struck upon the inmost spring Of all Colonna's hate; for in obedience To your high will, I humbly made myself Your pleasure's minister, and to her ear I bore your proffered love, which he discovering Hath tried to root me from my prince's heartâ King. Where thou shalt ever flourish! But, Ludovico, But thou hast told her!âIs there hope, my friend? Lud. She shall be yoursânay, moreâand well you know That you may trust your servantânot alone Colonna's lovely sister shall be yours: But, mark my speech, Colonna's self shall draw The chaste white curtains from her virgin-bed, And lead you to her arms! King. What! her fierce brother Yield his consent? Lud. Inquire not how, my liege, I would accomplish thisâtrust to my pledgeâ This very night. King. To-night! Am I so near To heaven, Ludovico? Lud. You are, my liege, To-night upon the breast of paradise You shall most soundly sleep. (Aside.) King. My faithful friend! And dost thou say, Colonna will himselfâ? Lud. Colonna's self shall bear her to your arms, And bid her on to dalliance. King. Oh, my friend, Thou art the truest servant that e'er yet Tended his sovereign's wish: but dost not fear, Her purposed marriage with Vicentio May make some obstacle? Lud. I have recalled him From Florence, whither as ambassador, In honourable exile he was sent. King. Recalled him! 'Twas to interrupt his love That he was sent. Lud. My projects need his coming. For I intend to make Vicentio An instrument to crown you with her charms! King. How shall I bless thee, my Ludovico? Dost thou think 'Tis strange I pine for herâbut why inquire Of thee, who once wert kindled by her charms. Lud. My liege! (A little disturbed.) King. She did prefer Vicentio. Lud. She shall prefer you to Vicentio. King. My dear Ludovico, within my soul More closely will I wear thee!â Tell her we'll shower all honour on her head. And here, Ludovico, to testify That we have given ourselves, bear to her heart This image of her king! Lud. I am in all your servant. King. My Ludovico, We never can reward thee! Come, my friends, (Crosses to R. H.) Let's to some fresh-imagined sport, and wile The languid hours in some device of joy, To help along the lazy flight of time, And quicken him with pleasure. My Ludovico! Remember! [Exeunt King and ten of the Courtiers, R. H. Banners and Guards, R. H. U. E.; Spalatro, and four other Conspirators remain behind with Ludovico. Lud. He is gone, And my unloosened spirit dares again To heave within my bosom!âOh, Colonna, With an usurious vengeance I'll repay thee, And cure the talking devil in thy tongue! (To Spalatro.)âGive me thy hand, and let thy pulse again Beat with a temperate and healthful motion, Of full security. We are safe, my friends, And in the genius of Ludovico, An enterprise shall triumph. Spal. We began to tremble when you enteredâbut full soon With admiration we beheld you tread Secure the steeps of ruin, and preserve us. Lud. That damn'd Colonna!âby the glorious star Of my nativity, I do not burn For empire, with a more infuriate thirst, Than for revenge! Spal. My poniard's at your service. (First and Second Conspirators half draw their daggers.) Lud. Not for the world, my friends! I'll turn my vengeance to utility, And must economize my hateâWhom think you Have I marked out assassin of the king? Spal. Piero, perchanceâhe strikes the poniard deep. Lud. A better hand at it. Spal. Bartolo, thenâ He pushes the stiletto to the heart. Lud. No! Spal. Then yourself will undertake the deed. Lud. That were against all wisdomâNo, my friends, Colonnaâ Spal. What, Colonna?âhe that now Accused you here? Lud. Colonna!â Spal. 'Tis impossible!â From his great father he inherited A sort of passion in his loyalty: In him it mounts to folly. Lud. Yet Spalatro, I'll make a murderer of himâknow you not He has a sister? Spal. Yes, the fair Evadne, You once did love yourself. Lud. There thou hast touched me. And I am weak enough to love her yet, If that indeed be love that doth consume me; It is a sort of monster in my heart, Made up of horrid contrarieties! She scorns me for that smooth Vicentioâ Not only does he thwart me in my love, But, well I know his influence in the state Would, when the king is sent to paradise, Be cast between me and the throneâhe dies!â Colonna too shall perish, and the crown Shall with Evadne's love be mine. Enter Officer, L. H. How now? Officer. My lord, the lady Olivia Waits on your highness. Lud. I desired her here, And straight I will attend her. [Exit Officer, L. H. With a straw A town may be consumed, and I employ This woman's passion for Vicentio, As I would use a poison'd pin, to kill. Spal. She long hath lov'd Vicentio. Lud. He shall wed herâ And from the hand of Hymen, death shall snatch The nuptial torch, and use it for his own! I haste me to her presence. (Takes out the King's picture.) Come! fair bauble, Thou now must be employed.â(To Spal.)âDost thou not think, Even in this image, that he bears the soft And wanton aspect with the which he bid me To cater for his villanous appetiteâ And with what luxury?âEvadne's charms!â Evadne that I love?â Spal. But, didst thou not Thyself evoke that passion in his breast? Lud. I did, 'tis trueâbut for mine own success. I hate him!â There is the very face with which he first Pour'd his unholy wishes in mine earâ Ha! dost thou smile upon me?âI will turn Those glittering eyes, where love doth now inhabit, To two dark hollow palaces, for death To keep his mouldering state in. He dares to hope that I will make myself The wretched officer of his desires, And smooth the bed for his lascivious pleasuresâ But I full soon will teach his royalty, The beds I make are lasting ones, and lie In the dark chambers of eternity!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âA Room in the Palace. Enter Olivia and Ludovico, R. H. Lud. Dispose of it as I instructed you; (Giving her the king's picture.) You know that I have pledged myself to make Vicentio yours. To-day yourself have given The means to turn that promise into deed. Oliv. My own heart Tells me, 'tis a bad office I have ta'en; But this unhappy passion drives me on, And makes my soul your thrallâThus I have crept Obedient to your counsels, meanly crept Into Evadne's soft, and trusting heart, And coiled myself around herâThus, my lord, Have I obtained the page of amorous sighs That you enjoined me to secureâI own 'Twas a false deed, but I am gone too far To seek retreat, and will obey you still. Lud. And I will crown your passion with the flowers Of Hymen's yellow garlandâTrust me, Olivia, That once dissevered from Evadne's love, He will soon be taught to prize your nobler frame, And more enkindled beautyâWell, 'tis known Ere he beheld the sorceress He deemed you fairest of created things, And would have proffered love, had notâ Oliv. I pray you, With gems of flattery do not disturb The fount of bitterness within my soul;â For dropped tho' ne'er so nicely, they but stir The poisoned waters as they fall.âI have said I will obey you. Lud. With this innocent page Will I light up a fire within Vicentio,â But you must keep it flaming;âI have ta'en Apt means to drive him into jealousy. By scattering rumours (which have reached his ear) Before he comes to Naples,âe'en in Florence Have I prepared his soft and yielding mind To take the seal that I would fix upon it. I do expect him with the fleeting hour,â For, to my presence he must come to bear His embassy's commission, and be sure He leaves me with a poison in his heart, Evadne's lips shall never suck away. Oliv. Then will I hence, and if 'tis possible, Your bidding shall be done.âVicentio! Enter Vicentio, R. H. Vic. Hail to my lord! Lud. Welcome, Vicentio! I have not clasp'd your hand this many a day! Welcome from Florence. In your absence, sir, Time seemed to have lost his feathers. Vic. It was kind To waste a thought upon me.âFair Olivia, Florence hath dimmed mine eyes, or I must else Have seen a sun-beam sooner.â(Crosses to centre.)âFair Olivia, How does your lovely friend? Oliv. What friend, my lord? Vic. I trust nought evil hath befallen Evadne, That you should feign to understand me not How does my beautiful and plighted love? Oliv. How does she, sir? I pray you, my good lord To ask such tender question of the king. [Exit, L. H. Vic. What meant she by the king? (Aside.) Lud. You seem, Vicentio, O'ershadowed with reflectionâshould you Not have used some soft detaining phrase to one, Who should at least be pitied? Vic. I came here To re-deliver to your hands, my lord, The high commission of mine embassy, That long delayed my marriage. You, I deem My creditor, in having used your sway In my recall to Naples. Lud. In return for such small service, I hope That you will not forget Ludovico, When in the troop of thronging worshippers, At distance you behold his stooping plume Bend in humility. Vic. What means my lord? Lud. Act not this ignoranceâyour glorious fortune Hath filled the common mouthâ Your image stands already in the mart Of pictured ridicule.âCome, do not wear The look of studied wondermentâyou know Howe'er I stand upon the highest place In the king's favour, that you will full soon Supplant the poor Ludovico. Vic. I am no Ådipus. Lud. You would have me speak in simpler phrase; Vicentio, You are to be the favourite of the king. Vic. The favourite of the king! Lud. Certes, Vicentio. In our Italian courts, the generous husband Receives his monarch's recompensing smile, That with alchymic power, can turn the mass Of dull opprobrious shame, to one bright heap Of honour and emolument. I bid you joy, my lordâwhy, how is this? Do you not yet conceive me? Know you not You are to wed the mistress of the king? Colonna's sisterâaye, I have said it, sir,â Now, do you understand me? Vic. Villain, thou liest! Lud. What? are you not to marry her? Vic. Thou liest; Tho' thou wert ten times what thou art already, Not all the laurels heaped upon thy head Should save thee from the lightnings of my wrath! Lud. If it were my will, The movement of my hand should beckon death To thy presumption. But I have proved too oft I bore a fearless heart, to think you dare To call me cowardâand I am too wise To think I can revenge an injury By giving you my life. But I compassionate, Nay, I have learned to esteem thee for a wrath, That speaks thy noble nature. Fare thee well! (Crosses to L. H.) Thy pulse is now too fevered for the cure I honestly intendedâyet, before I part, here take this satisfying proof Of what a woman's made of. (Gives him a letter.) Vic. It is her character! Hast thou shed phosphor on the innocent page, That it has turned to fire? Lud. Thou hast thy fate. Vic. 'Tis signed, âEvadne.â Lud. Yes, it isâfarewell! Vic. For heaven's sake, hear me.âStay.âOh, pardon me For the rash utterance of a frantic manâ Speak! in mercy speak! Lud. I will, In mercy speak, indeed.âIn mercy to That fervid generosity of heart That I behold within thee. Vic. From whom is this? Lud. From whom? look there! Vic. Evadne! Lud. 'Tis written to the king and to my hand. For he is proud of it, as if it were A banner of high victory, he bore it, To evidence his valour.âIt is grown His cup-theme now, and your Evadne's name Is lisped with all the insolence on his tongue Of satiated triumphâhe exclaimsâ The poor Vicentio! Vic. The poor Vicentio! Lud. What! shall he murder him?â(Aside.)âno, no,âColonna! The poor Vicentio!âand he oftentimes Cries, that he pities you! Vic. He pities me! Lud. I own that some time I was infidel To all the bombast vaunting of the king, Butâ Vic. 'Tis Evadne!âI have gazed upon it, In hope that with the glaring of mine eyes I might burn out the false and treacherous wordâ But, still 'tis thereâno moreâelse will it turn My brain to a red furnace,âLook you, my lordâ Thus as I rend the cursed evidence Of that vile woman's falsehoodâthus I cast My love into the winds, and as I tread Upon the poisoned fragments of the snake That stings me into madness, thus, Ludovico, Thus do I trample on her! Lud. Have you ne'er heard, For 'twas so widely scattered in the voice Of common rumour, that the very wind, If it blew fair for Florenceâ Vic. I have heard Some whispers, which I long had flung away With an incredulous hatred from my heartâ But now, this testimony has conjured All other circumstances in one vast heap Of damned certainty!âFarewell, my lordâ (Crosses to L. H.) Lud. Hear me, Vicentio, Vengeance is left you stillâthe deadliest too That a false woman can be made to feel: Take her exampleâbe not satisfied With casting her for ever from your heart, But to the place that she has forfeited, Exalt a lovelier thanâbut I perceive You are not in a mood to hear me nowâ Some other time, Vicentioâand, meanwhile, Despite your first tempestuous suddenness, You will think that I but meant your honour well In this proceeding. Vic. I believe I owe you That sort of desperate gratitude, my lord, The dying patient owes the barbarous knife, That delves in throes of mortal agony, And tears the rooted cancer from his heart! [Exeunt, L. H. SCENE II. âA Room in Colonna's Palace. Enter Evadne, M. D. looking at a picture. Evad. 'Tis strange he comes not! thro' the city's gates His panting courser passed before the sun Had climbed to his meridian, yet he comes not!â Ah! Vicentio, To know thee near me, yet behold thee not, Is sadder than to think thee far away; For I had rather that a thousand leagues Of mountain ocean should dissever us, Than thine own heart, Vicentio.âSure, Vicentio, If thou didst know with what a pining gaze I feed mine eyes upon thine image here, Thou wouldst not now leave thine Evadne's love To this same cold idolatry. Enter Olivia, unperceived, L. H. U. E. I will swear That smile's a false one, for it sweetly tells No tarrying indifference.âOlivia! Oliv. I have stolen unperceived upon your hours Of lonely meditation, and surprised Your soft soliloquies to that fair face.â Nay, do not blushâreserve that rosy dawn For the soft pressure of Vicentio's lips. Evad. You mock me, fair Olivia,âI confess That musing on my cold Vicentio's absence, I quarrelled with the blameless ivory. Oliv. He was compelled as soon as he arrived, To wait upon the great Ludovico; Meanwhile your soft, expecting moments flow In tender meditation on the face, You dare to gaze upon in ivory With fonder aspect, than when you behold Its bright original; for then 'tis meet Your pensive brows be bent upon the ground, And sighs as soft as zephyrs on the wave Should gently heave your heart.âIs it not so? Nay, do not now rehearse your part, I pray;â Reserve those downcast lookings for Vicentio; That's a fair pictureâlet me, if you dare Entrust the treasure to another's hand, Let me look on it. (Takes Vicentio's picture.) What a sweetness plays On those half-opened lips!âHe gazed on you When those bright eyes were painted. Evad. You have got A heart so free of care, that you can mock Your pensive friend with such light merriment. But hark! I hear a step. Oliv. (Aside.) Now fortune aid me In her precipitation. Evad. It is himself!â Olivia, he is coming.âWell I know My Lord Vicentio hastens to mine eyes! The pictureâpr'ythee give it back to meâ I must constrain you to it. Oliv. (Who has substituted the picture of the king.) It is in vain To struggle with you thenâwith what a grasp You rend it from my hand, as if it were Vicentio that I had stolen away. (Gives her the king's picture, which Evadne places in her bosom.) I triumph!â(Aside.)âHe is comingâI must leave you, Nor interrupt the meeting of your hearts By my officious presence. [Exit, L. H. Evad. It is himself! Swiftly he passes through the colonnade, Oh! Vicentio, Thy coming bears me joy as bright as e'er Beat thro' the heart of woman, that was made For suffering, and for transport!âOh, Vicentio! Enter Vicentio, R. H. Are you then come at last?âdo I once more Behold my bosom's lord, whose tender sight Is necessary for my happiness As light for heaven!âMy lord!âVicentio!â I blush to speak the transport in my heart, But I am rapt to see you. Vic. Dissembling woman! (Aside.) Evad. How is this, my lord? You look altered. Vic. But you do not look alteredâwould you did! Let me peruse the face where loveliness Stays, like the light after the sun is set. Sphered in the stillness of those heaven-blue eyes, The soul sits beautiful; the high white front, Smooth as the brow of Pallas, seems a temple Sacred to holy thinking! and those lips Wear the sweet smile of sleeping infancy, They are so innocent.âOh! Evadne, Thou art not alteredâwould thou wert! Evad. Vicentio, This strangeness I scarce hoped for.âSay, Vicentio, Has any ill befallen you?âI perceive That its warm bloom hath parted from your cheek, Ah me! you are not well, Vicentio. Vic. In sooth, I am not.âThere is in my breast A wound that mocks all cureâno salve, nor anodyne, Nor medicinal herb, can e'er allay The festering of that agonizing wound You have driven into my heart! Evad. I? Vic. Why, Evadne, Why did you ever tell me that you loved me? Why was I not in mercy spurned away, Scorned, like Ludovico? for unto him You dealt in honour, and despised his love: But me you soothed and flatteredâsighed and blushedâ And smiled and wept, for you can weep; (even now Your tears flow by volition, and your eyes Convenient fountains have begun to gush,) To stab me with a falsehood yet unknown In falsest woman's perfidy? Evad. Vicentio, Why am I thus accused? What have I done? Vic. What!âare you grown already an adept In cold dissimulation? Have you stopped All access from your heart into your face? Do you not blush? Evad. I do, indeed, for you! Vic. The king? Evad. The king? Vic. Come, come, confess at once, and wear it high Upon your towering foreheadâswell your portâ Away with this unseemly bashfulness, That will be deemed a savageness at courtâ Confront the talking of the busy worldâ Tell them you are the mistress of the king, Tell them you are Colonna's sister too; But hark you, madamâprithee do not say You are Vicentio's wife! (Crosses to L. H.) Evad. Injurious man! Vic. The very winds from the four parts of heaven Blew it throughout the cityâ Evad. And if angels Cried, trumpet-tongued, that I was false to you, You should not have believed it.âYou forget Who dares to stain a woman's honesty, Does her a wrong, as deadly as the brand He fears upon himself.âGo, go, Vicentioâ You are not what I deemed you!âMistress? fie! Go, go, Vicentio! let me not behold The man who has reviled me with a thought Dishonouring as that one!â(Crosses to L. H.)âOh! Vicentio, Do I deserve this of you? Vic. If I had wronged her!â Evad. I will not descend To vindicate myselfâdare to suspect meâ My lord, I am to guess that you came here, To speak your soul's revolt, and to demand Your plighted vows again.âIf for this You tarry here, I freely give you back Your late repented faithâFarewell for ever! (As she is going out, L. H.) Vic. Evadne! Evad. Well, my lord?â Vic. Evadne, stay!â Evad. Vicentio! (With a look of reproaching remonstrance.) Vic. Let me look in thy faceâ Oh! 'tis impossible!âI was bemocked, And cheated by that villain!ânothing false Sure ever looked like thee, and yet wilt thou But swearâ Evad. What should I swear?â Vic. That you did not Betray me to the king Evad. Never!â Vic. Nor e'er Didst write in love to him! Evad. Oh! never, never!âI perceive, Vicentio, Some villain hath abused thy credulous earâ But no!âI will not now inquire it of theeâ When I am calmerâI must hence betimes, To chase these blots of sorrow from my face,â For if Colonna should behold me weep, So tenderly he loves me, that I fear His hot, tempestuous natureâWhy, Vicentio, Do you still wrong me with a wildered eye That sheds suspicion? Vic. I now remember Another circumstance, Ludovico Did tell me as I cameâI do not see My picture on her bosom. (Aside.) Evad. Well, Vicentio? Vic. When I departed hence, about your neck I hung my pictured likeness, which mine eyes, Made keen by jealous vigilance, perchance Desire upon your breast. Evad. And, is that all? And in such fond and petty circumstance Seek you suspicion's nourishment?âVicentio, I must disclose my weaknessâhere, Vicentio, I have pillowed your dear image on a heart You should not have distrusted. (She draws the king's picture from her bosom.) Here it isâ And now, my lord, suspect me, if you can. Vic. (Starting.) A horrid phantom, more accursed than e'er Yet crossed the sleep of frenzy, stares upon meâ Speakâspeak at onceâ Orâlet it blast thee too. Evad. Sure some dark spell, Some fearful witchery; I am struck to ashes,â Amazement, like the lightningâgive it me, And I will fix it in my very eyes, Clasp it against my sightâ'Tis not Vicentio!â Vic. It is the king!â Evad. Oh! do not yield it faith,â Give not thy senses credence! Oh, Vicentio, I am confounded, maddened, lost, Vicentio! Some dÃ¦mon paints it on the coloured airâ 'Tis not reality that stares upon me!â Oh! hide it from my sight!â Vic. Chance has betrayed thee, And saves my periled honourâHere, thou all fraud, Thou mass of painted perjury,âthou woman!â And now I have done with thee, and pray to heaven I ne'er may see thee moreâBut, hold!â Recall that wish againâThe time will come When I would look on theeâthen, Evadne, then, When the world's scorn is on thee, let me see Thee, old in youth, and bending 'neath the load Of sorrow, not of timeâthen let me see thee, And mayest thou, as I pass, lift up thy head But once from the sad earth, and then Evadne, Look down again for ever! [Exit, R. H. Enter Colonna, M. D. in time to see Vicentio go off. (Evadne at first not perceiving that he is gone, and recovering from her stupefaction.) Evad. I will swearâ Give it back to meâOh! I am innocent! (She rushes up to Colonna, who advances to R. H. mistaking him for a moment for Vicentio.) By heaven, I am innocent! Col. Who dares to doubt it,â Who knows thee of that noble family That cowardice in man, or wantonness In woman never tarnished?â Evad. He is gone!â (Aside.) Col. But how is this, Evadne? In your face I read a wildered air has ta'en the place Of that placidity that used to shine For ever on thy holy countenance. Evad. Now, as I value my Vicentio's lifeâ Col. One of love's summer clouds, I doubt me, sister, Hath floated o'er you, tho' 'twere better far That it had left no rain drops.âWhat has happened? Evad. There's nothing has befallen, onlyâ Col. What, only? Evad. I pray your pardon meâI must begone! Col. Evadne, stay! let me behold you wellâ Why do you stand at distance? nearer still, Evadne!â Evad. Well? Col. Vicentioâ Evad. (Assuming an affected lightness of manner.) Why, Colonnaâ Think you that I'm without my sex's arts, And did not practise all the torturings That make a woman's triumph? Col. 'Twas not well. I hoped thee raised above all artifice That makes thy sex but infancy matured. I was at first inclined to follow him, And ask what this might mean? Evad. Then he had told That I had played the tyrant.âHad you seen How like my peevish lap-dog he appeared Just beaten with a fan.âHa! ha! Colonna, You will find us all alike.âHa! ha! my heart Will break. (Bursts into tears.) Col. Farewell! Evad. What would you do? Col. Let all the world Hold me a slave, and hoard upon my head Its gathered infamyâbe all who bear Colonna's name scorn-blightedâmay disgrace Gnaw off all honour from my family, If I permit an injury to thee To 'scape Colonna's vengeance!â Evad. Hold, my brother! I will not leave thy sight! Col. Then follow me, And if thou art abandoned, after all Vicentio's plighted faith, thou shalt beholdâ By heavens, an emperor should not do thee wrong, Or if he did, tho' I had a thousand lives, I had given them all to avenge thee.âI'll inquire Into this business; and if I find Thou hast lost a lover, I will give him proof, I've my right arm, and thou thy brother still.

Thou hast resolved me. I thank thee for thy counsel, and at once (Crosses to R. H.) Speed to its dreadful performance. (He raps R. H. D. F.) Enter a Servant, R. H. D. F. 'Bides the lady Olivia in her home? Serv. She does, my lord. [Exit, R. H. D. F. Vic. Farewell, Ludovico! thou seest, my friend, For such I ever hold thee, that I pass The stream of destiny. Thou sayest, Ludovico, 'Tis necessary for my fame. Lud. No less.â By marrying Olivia you disperse The noises that abroad did sully you, Of having given consent to play the cloak To the king's dalliance. Vic. Oh, speak of it No more, Ludovicoâfarewell, my friend, I will obey your counsels.â[Exit into Olivia's house. Lud. Fare you well, My passionate, obsequious instrument, Whom now I scorn so much, I scarcely let thee Reach to the dignity of being hated. Enter the King, L. H. disguised. King. My faithful servant, my Ludovico! Lud. My prince! I did not hope to meet you here! What, in this masqued attire, has made you veil The dazzling brightness of your royalty, And led you from your palace? King. I have ta'en Concealment's wonted habit, to escape The hundred eyes of curiosity, And, wearied with the rotatory course Of dull unchanging pleasure, sought for thee. Shall she be mine, Ludovico? Lud. My liege, I marvel not at the impatient throb Of restless expectation in your heart. And know, my liege, that not in vain I toil, To waft you to her bosom, for Vicentio Renounces her for ever! and but moved By my wise counsels, hath already prayed The fair Olivia's hand. King. How, my Ludovico, Didst thou accomplish it? Lud. I turned to use The passion of Olivia; while Evadne traced A letter to Vicentio, suddenly The news of his expected coming reached Her panting breast, and in the rush of joy, Unfinished on her table did she leave The page of amorous wishes, which the care Of unperceived Olivia, haply seized, And bore unto my hand.âVicentio's name Was drowned in hurried vocatives of love, As thusââMy lordâmy lifeâmy soul,ââthe which I made advantage of, and did persuade him 'Twas written to your highness,âand with lights Caught from the very torch of truest love, I fired the furies' brandsâ King. My faithful friend! Lud. Then with your picture did Olivia work Suspicion into frenzyâwhen he came From your Evadne's house, I threw myself, As if by fortune, in his path:âI urged His heated passions to my purposes, And bade him ask Olivia's hand, to prove How much he scorned her falsehood.âEven now He makes his suit, for there Olivia dwells, And as you came, he entered. King. But wherein Will this promote the crowning of my love? Lud. I said Colonna's self should be the first To lead you to her armsâ King. Thou didst, Ludovico, The which perform'd, I'll give thee half my realm. (Crosses to R. H.) Lud. (Aside.) You shall give all! King. Accomplish this, my friend, Thou art my great Apollo! Lud. No, my liege, You shall be Jove, and in her arms to-night, Will taste more joys than the Olympian did In golden showers in DanaÃ«'s yielding heartâ King. Ludovico, thou art as dear to me As the rich circle of my royalty. Farewell, Ludovico, I shall expect Some speedy tidings from theeâfare thee well! To-night, Ludovico. [Exit, R. H. Lud. To-night, you perish! Colonna's dagger shall let out your blood, And lance your wanton, and high-swelling veins.â That I should stoop to such an infamy! Evadne here! Enter Evadne, L. H. Not for the king, but for myself I mean, A feast fit for the gods! Evad. (With some agitation.) My Lord Ludovicoâ Lud. The beautiful Evadne! What would the brightest maid of Italy Of her poor servant? Evad. Sir, may I entreat Your knowledge where the Count Vicentio 'Bides at this present instant? I have been informed He 'companied you here. Lud. It grieves me sore He hath done you so much wrong. Evad. What may you mean? Lud. 'Tis talked of in the whispering gallery, Where envy holds her court: Who would have thought Vicentio's heart was like A play-thing stuck with Cupid's lightest plumes Thus to be tossed from one heart to another? Or rather, who had thought that you were made For such abandonment? Evad. I scarce can guessâ Lud. I did not mean to touch so nice a wound. If you desire to learn where now he 'bides, I can inform you. Evad. Where, Ludovico? Lud. Yonder, Evadne, in Olivia's house. Evad. Olivia's house? what would he there? Lud. You know Vicentio and Olivia are to-dayâ Evad. My lord? Lud. Are to be marriedâ Evad. Married, my lord? Vicentio and Olivia to be married?â Lud. I am sorry that it moves you thusâEvadne; Had I been used as that ingrate, be sure I ne'er had proved like himâI would not thus Have flung thee like a poppy from my heart, A drowsy sleep-provoking flower:âEvadne, I had not thus deserted you! [Exit, R. H. Evad. Vicentio, Olivia and Vicentio to be married? I heard itâyesâI am sure I didâVicentio! Olivia to be married!âand Evadne, Whose heart was made of adorationâ Vicentio in her house? thereâunderneath That woman's roofâbehind the door that looks To shut me out from hope.âI will myselfâ (Advancing, then checking herself.) I do not dare to do itâbut he could notâ He could not use me thusâhe could not.âHa! Enter Vicentio, from Olivia's house, R. H. D. F. Vic. Evadne here? Evad. Would I had been born blind, Not to behold the fatal evidence Of my abandonment!âAm I condemned Even by the ocular proof, to be made sure That I'm a wretch for ever!â Vic. (Advances R. H.) Does she come To bate me with reproaches? or does she dare To think that she can angle me again To the vile pool wherein she meant to catch me? I'll pass her with the bitterness of scorn, Nor seem to know her present to my sight. (Crosses to L. H. and passes Evadne.) Now I am at least revenged. (Going, L. H.) Evad. My lord, I pray youâ My lord, I dare entreatâVicentioâ Vic. Who calls upon Vicentio? Was it you? What would you with him, for I bear the name. Evad. Sir, Iâ Vic. Go on.âI'll taunt her to the quick.â(Aside.) Evad. My lord, Iâ Vic. I pray you speakâI cannot guess By such wild broken phrase what you would have Of one who knows you not. Evad. Not know me? Vic. Noâ Let me look in your faceâthere is indeed Some faint resemblance to a countenance Once much familiar to Vicentio's eyes, But 'tis a shadowy one;âshe that I speak of Was full of virtues as the milky way Upon a frozen night is thick with stars. She was as pure as an untasted fountain, Fresh as an April blossom, kind as love, And good as infants giving charity!â Such was Evadne:âfare you well! Evad. My lord, Is't true what I've heard?â Vic. What have you heard? Evad. Speakâare you to be marriedâlet me hear itâ Thank heav'n I've strength to hear it. Vic. I scarce guess What interest you find in one that deems Himself a stranger to you. Evad. Sirâ Vic. But if You are indeed solicitous to learn Aught that imports me, learn that I to-day Have asked the fair Olivia's hand, in place of oneâ Evad. You have bedewed with tears, and that henceforth Will feel no lack of tears, though they may fall From other eyes than yours.âSo then, Vicentio, Fame did not wrong you.âYou are to be married?â Vic. To one within whose heart as pure a fire As in the shrine of Vesta long has burned. Not the coarse flame of a corrupted heart, To every worship dedicate alike, A false perfidious seeming.â Evad. I implore you To spare your accusations.âI am comeâ Vic. Doubtless, to vindicate yourself.â Evad. Oh, no!â An angel now would vainly plead my cause Within Vincentio's heartâtherefore, my lord, I have no intent to interrupt the rite That makes that lady yours; but I am come Thus breathless as you see meâwould to heav'n I could be tearless too!âyou will think, perhaps, That 'gainst the trembling fearfulness I sin, That best becomes a woman, and that most Becomes a sad abandoned one.â Vic. Evadneâ Evadne, you deceive yourself. Evad. I knew I should encounter thisâ But I will endure itânay, more, my lord, Hear all the vengeance I intend.â Vic. Go on.â Evad. May you be happy with that happier maid That never could have loved you more than I do, But may deserve you better!âMay your days, Like a long stormless summer, glide away, And peace and trust be with you!â And when at last you close your gentle lives, Blameless as they were blessed, may you fall Into the grave as softly, as the leaves Of two sweet roses on an autumn eve, Beneath the soft sighs of the western wind, Drop to the earth together!âfor myselfâ I will but prayâ(Sobbing.)âI will but pray, my lord. Vic. (Aside.) I must begone, else she may soon regain A mastery o'er my nature. Evad. Oh, Vicentio, I see that I am doomed a trouble to you. I shall not long be so. There's but one trouble I shall ever give To any one again. I will but pray The maker of the lonely beds of peace To open one of his deep hollow ones, Where misery goes to sleep, and let me in;â If ever you chance to pass beside my grave, I am sure you'll not refuse a little sigh, And if my friend, (I still will call her so) My friend, Olivia, chide you, pr'ythee tell her Not to be jealous of me in my grave. Vic. The picture! in your bosomânear your heartâ There on the very swellings of your breast, The very shrine of chastity, you raised A foul and cursed idol! Evad. You did not give me timeânoânot a moment To think what villainy was wrought, to make me So hateful to your eyes.âIt is too late, You are Olivia's, I have no claim to youâ You have renounced meâ Vic. Come, confessâconfessâ Evad. What then should I confess? that you, that heaven, That all the world seem to conspire against me, And that I am accursed.âBut let me holdâ I waste me in the selfishness of woe, While life perchance is periled.âOh, Vicentio, Prithee avoid Colonna's sight! Vic. Evadne?â You do not think to frighten me with his name? Evad. Vicentio, do not take away from me All that I've left to love in all the world! Avoid Colonna's sight to-day.âVicentio, Only to-day avoid him,âI will find Some way to reconcile him to my fateâ I'll lay the blame upon my hapless head!â Only to-day, Vicentio. Enter Colonna, R. H. S. E. Col. (R. H.) Ha! my sister! Where is thy dignity? Where is the pride Meet for Colonna's sister?âhence!âMy lordâ Vic. (L. H.) What would you, sir? Col. Your life:âyou are briefly answered. Look here, sir.âTo this lady you preferred Your despicable love! Long did you woo, And when at last by constant adoration, Her sigh revealed that you were heard, you gained Her brother's cold assent.âWell thenâno moreâ For I've no patience to repeat by cause The wrong that thou hast done her. It has reached Colonna's ear that you have abandoned herâ It rings thro' Naples, my good lordânow, mark meâ I am her brotherâ Vic. Wellâ Evad. (In centre.) Forbear! forbear! I have no injury you should resent In such a fearful fashion.âIâmy brotherâ I am sure I never uttered a complaint Heaved with one sigh, nor shed a single tear. Look at me, good Colonna!ânow, Colonna Can you discern a sorrow in my face? I do not weepâI do notâlook upon meâ Why I can smile, Colonna. (Bursts into tears.) Oh! my brother!â Col. You weep, Evadne! but I'll mix your tears With a false villain's blood.âIf you have left A sense of aught that's noble in you stillâ Vic. My lord, you do mistake, if you have hope Vicentio's name was e'er designed to be The cloak of such vile purposeâ Col. How? explainâ I understand you not. Evad. Forbear, Colonna; Before your face, and in the face of heaven, I do resign him;âI forgive him, And may heaven follow my example too! Col. But I will not, Evadne.âI shall deal In briefest phrase with you.âIs't true, my lord, You have abandoned her? Vic. Is't true, my lord, That to the kingâ Col. The king? Vic. And could you think That I am to be made an instrument For such a foul advancement? do you think That I would turn my name into a cloak?â Evad. Colonna, my dear brother. Oh, Vicentio! My love, my life, myâpardon me, my lord, I had forgotâI have no right to use Words that were once familiar to my lips: But, for heaven's sake, I do implore you hereâ Col. Sir, you said something, if I heard aright, Touching the king;âexplain yourself. Vic. I will! I will not wed his mistress! Evad. (With reproach.) Oh, Vicentio! Col. Whom mean you, sir? Vic. Look there! Col. Evadne! ha? Vic. Evadne! Col. (Crosses to centre, and strikes him with his glove.) Here's my answer! follow me! Beyond the city's gates, I shall expect you. [Exit, L. H. Evad. (Clinging to Vicentio, who has his sword drawn, and kneeling to him.) You shall not stir! Vic. If from his heart I poured A sea of blood, it would not now content me. Insolent villain! dost thou stay me back? Away! unloose me! Evad. Olivia, hear meâlisten to my cryâ It is thy husband's life that now I plead for; Save, oh, save him! Vic. Then must I fling thee from me.âNow I am free, And swift as lightning on the whirlwind's wings, I rush to my revenge! [Exit, L. H. Evad. (Who has fallen upon her knees in her struggle with Vicentio.) Oh! my poor heart! Choak not, thou struggling spirit, in my breast, Hear me, Olivia!âOlivia, hear me! Enter Olivia from her house, M. D. Oliv. (R. H.) Is't Evadne calls Like one that with a frantic energy In fire cries out for life? Evad. (L. H.) I cry for lifeâ Vicentio's lifeâColonna's lifeâOlivia, I beg thee to preserve him! Oliv. Whom dost talk of? Evad. You have power o'er him that I no more possess, Had he e'er loved me as he loves thee now, I had been stronger when around his neck I flung me to preserve him.âOh, my friend! Colonna, maddened at my miseries, And I confess that I am miserable, Hath vowed a horrid vengeance, and even now He smote Vicentio! Oliv. Heaven! Evad. I prithee, look not Misdoubtingly upon meâ Hast thou not wings to save him? Oliv. Thou art avenged, Evadne!âTo himself I dare not own itâbut to thee reveal The vileness I have practised. Evad. Speak! Oliv. In the wild rapturous tremor of thy joy, I seized advantage of Vicentio's coming, And placed within thine unsuspecting handâ Evad. That horrid image that appeared to fill My bosom with perdition, and did make me Unto myself so horribleâ'twas youâ It was my friend Olivia! Oliv. I myself, Will to the king, and bid him send his power To interpose between themâthou, Evadne, Wilt speak my guilt. [Exit, R. H. Evad. Oh, my Vicentio! I fly to save and comfort you! [Exit, L. H.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âThe Bay, and View of Naples. Enter Colonna and Vicentio, L. H. with their swords drawn;âpassing across to R. H. Col. Yonder, my lord, beside the cypress grove Fast by the church-yardâthere's a place, methinks, Where we may 'scape the eye of observation. Vic. I follow, sirâthe neighbourhood of the grave Will suit our purpose well, for you or I Must take its measure ere the sun be set. [Exeunt, R. H. Enter Ludovico, L. H. S. E. as they go off. Lud. Ha! there they go!âthe furies, with their whips Of hissing serpents, lash you to your fateâ My dull and passionate foolsâyou fall at last Into the pit I have dug for youâthe grave.â You grasp the murdering hilt, while I, in thought, Already clench the glorious staff of empire. I hate you both!âOne of you has denounced meâ The other, robbed me of a woman's love. They have already entered in the grove Of funeral cypress.âNow they are lost Amid the crowded trunksâand yet a moment And they will be about it!âNow, Vicentio, Thy fate is sealed.âColonna's armâ Ha! who comes here? Evadne!âyesâmy eyes deceive me notâ 'Twas happiest chance that led me to the fieldâ She must be interruptedâlet me thinkâ I have it.â Enter Evadne, L. H. Evad. For heaven's sake, whoe'er you are, Tell me which way they passedâdoth not this lead To the eastern gate of the city.âHa! Ludovico! My lord, my lordâmy brother, and Vicentioâ Lud. I know it allâand I shall thank the fate That made Ludovico the messenger Of such blest tidings to Evadne's earâ Your brother and Vicentio. Evad. Speak, my lordâ For heaven's sake, speak! Lud. They are secureâthank heaven, Their purpose is prevented.â Evad. Secure! My brother and Vicentio are secure. Lud. By providential circumstance, before Their purpose was accomplished, both were seized, And all their furious passions are as hushed As the still waters of yon peaceful bay. Evad. Ludovico, I cannot speak how much Thou has bound me to thee, by the holy sounds Thou hast breathed upon mine ear!âBut, tell me, sir, Where, how, and when was this? What blessed handâ Speak, my lord. Lud. 'Twas I! Evad. 'Twas you, Ludovico? Lud. The same! Hearing Olivia's marriage with Vicentio, I saw the dreadful issue, and I flew With the strong arm of power to intercept them. Evad. 'Twas you, Ludovicoâwhat shall I say? I know not what to tell you.âBut, heav'n bless you! A thousand times heav'n bless you!âOn my knees, And at your feet I thank you. (Kneels.) Lud. Beautiful Evadne! Loveliest beneath the skies, where every thing Grows lovely as themselvesâNay do not bend Your eyes, and hide beneath these fleecy clouds Stars beaming as the evening one, nor turn That cheek away, that, like a cold rose, seems Besprankt with snow!ânor strive to win from me Those hands, which he who formed the lily, formed With imitative whitenessâI will presume, For your dear sight hath made a madman of me, To press my rapture hereâ (Kisses her hand.) Evad. My lord, I own, That you surprise me, and were I not bound By strenuous obligation, I should say, Perchance you did offend meâBut I will not! Accept my gratitude, and be you sure These thanks are from a warm and honest heart. FarewellâI do forgiveâ Lud. You fly me then! Evad. I do not fly your presence, but I go To seek my brother's bosomâ Lud. And Vicentio's! Evad. You would be merry, sir. Lud. I have not causeâ Nor shall you, madamâYou would fly me thus, To rush at once into my rival's armsâ Nay, do not startâhe well deserves the nameâ I know him by no other. Evad. Sir, I hope You will not revive a subject that has long Between us been forgotten. Lud. What! forgotten? I did not think to hear itâsaid you forgotten? Nay, do not think you leave meâin return For such small service as I have done to-day, I beg your audienceâtell me what's forgotten? I would hear it from your lips. Evad. I did not meanâ Forgive, and let me go. (Crosses to R. H.) Lud. What? what forgotten? Your heartlessness to all the maddening power Of the tumultuous passions in my heart! What? what forgotten? all the injuries You have cast upon my headâthe stings of fire You have driven into my soulâmy agonies, My tears, my supplications, and the groans Of my indignant spirit! I can hold My curbed soul no moreâit rushes out! What? what forgotten?âmeâLudovico? Evad. I pray you, my good lord, for heaven's sake, hear me. Lud. What! to behold him, like a pilferer, With his smooth face of meanless infancy, And his soft moulded body, steal away That feathered thing, thy heart. Evad. Ludovico, What may this sudden fury mean?âyou do But act these horrid passions to affright me! For you to-day preserved him, did you not? Did you not say you saved Vicentio? Lud. I will permit you shortly to embrace himâ I will not long detain you from his armsâ But you will find him grown as cold a lover As moonlight statuesâhis fond arms will hang In loosened idleness about your form,â And from those lips where you were wont t'imbibe The fiery respiration of the heart, You will touch the coldness of the unsunned snow, Without its purity. Evad. I now perceive What you would hint, my lord;âdoubtless you deem Vicentio hath preferred Olivia's love? Lud. If you can wake his heart to love again, I'll hold you for a sorceressâno, Evadne, You ne'er shall be Vicentio'sâbut mine! Evad. Yours! Lud. Mine!âI have said it, and before to-night I'll verify the prophecy. Evad. I know not What lies within the dark and horrid cave Of your imagination; but be sure I had rather clasp Vicentio deadâI see That you recoil with passion. Lud. By the firesâ Down, down, my burning heart!âSo you would rather Within Vicentio's cold and mouldering shroud Warm into love, than on this beating heart? But, be it soâyou will have occasion soon To try the experimentâand then, Evadne, You will more aptly judge. Evad. Ha! a strong glare, Like the last flash from sinking ships, has poured A horrid radiance on meâHa! Ludovicoâ Let it be frenzy that before my face Spreads out that sheet of bloodâ Lud. Well, my Evadne? Evad. DÃ¦mon, hast thou mocked me? Lud. Didst thou not scornâdidst thou not madden me? Didst thou notâHa! (Seeing Colonna, crosses to R. H.) By heavens, it is himself!â All is accomplishedâand upon my front Methinks I clasp the round of royalty! Already do I clasp thee in mine arms!â Evadne!âThereâlook thereâColonna comes, (Crosses to L. H.) And on that weapon flaming from afar He bears the vengeance of Ludovico. [Exit, L. H. Enter Colonna, R. H., with his sword bloody. Col. Evadne here! Evad. My brother! Col. Call me soâ For I have proved myself to be thy brother. Look here!â Evad. There's blood upon it! Col. And there should be. Evad. Thou hastâ Col. I have revenged thee! Evad. Thou hast slainâ Villain, thou hast slain Vicentio? Col. I have revenged theeâ For any wrong done to my single self, I should, perhaps, repent me of the deed; But, for a wrong to theeâWhy dost thou look Up to the heavens with such a bewildered gaze? Evad. To curse thee, and myself, and all the world! Villain, thou hast slain Vicentio!âthou hast slain him Who was as dear unto my frantic heart, As thou art horrible!âand 'tis to me Thou comest to tell it tooâthou comest to bear That weapon weltering with my lover's blood, And stab these blasted eye-ballsâHide thee, villain! Hide thee within the centre of the earth!â Thou art all made of bloodâand to the sun Art grown detestableâ(Crosses to R. H.)âVicentio! My lord! my bosom's throb!âmy pulse of life! My soul! my joyâmy love!âmy all the world! Vicentio! Vicentio!â (Crosses to L. H.) Col. Thy passionate grief Doth touch me more than it beseems mine honour. Evad. Strike that infernal weapon through my heart! Colonna, kill me! Kill me, my brother! Col. Prithee, my Evadne, Let me conduct thy grief to secresyâ I must from hence prepare my speedy flight, For now my head is forfeit to the law! Enter Spalatro, with Officer and eight Guards, R. H. Spal. Behold him here. Sir, I am sorry for The duty which mine office hath prescribed! You are my prisoner. Col. Sir, there is need Of little words to excuse youâI was talking Of speeding me from Naples, as you came, But I scarce grieve you interrupt my flight,â Here is my sword. Spal. You are doomed to death! Evad. To death! Spal. The king himself, Hearing your combat with Vicentio, Hath sworn, that who survived, shall by the axeâ Col. You speak before a womanâI was well Acquainted with my fate before you spoke it. Evad. Death! must you die, Colonna! must you die? Oh! noânoâno! not die, sir,âsay not dieâ (Crosses to centre.) Col. Retire, my sisterâsir, I follow youâ Evad. Oh, not die, Colonna! no Colonna, They shall not take thee from me! Col. My sweet sister! I pray you, gentlemen, one moment moreâ This lady is my sister, and indeed Is now my only kin in all the world, And I must die for her sakeâmy sweet sister! Evad. No, no, not die, my brotherâOh! not die! Col. Evadne! sweet Evadne! Let me hear (Evadne becomes gradually insensible.) Thy voice before I goâI prithee, speakâ That even in death I may remember me Of its sweet sounds, EvadneâShe has fainted! Sir, I have a prayer to you.â Spal. It shall be granted. Col. My palace is hard byâlet some of these Good guardians of the law attend me thither. Evadne, for thy sake, I am almost loth To leave a world, the which, when I am gone Thou wilt find, I fear, a solitary one! [Exit, bearing Evadne, and followed by Spalatro and Guards, L. H. SCENE II. âA Prison. Enter Ludovico, R. H. meeting Spalatro, L. H. Lud. Where is Colonna?âNot yet arrived? Spal. Guarded he bore His sister to his palace, from the which He will be soon led here.â Lud. Spalatro, as I passed, a rumour came, Colonna's sword had but half done the work, And that Vicentio was not stabbed to deathâ If he still livesâbut till I am sure of it, No need to speak my resolution,â Thou art his friendâ Spal. Such I'm indeed accounted, But, save yourself, none doth deserve the name. Lud. Then, hie thee hence, Spalatro, to inform me, If yet Vicentio breathesâ(Spalatro crosses to R. H.âand afterwards, I'll make some trial of thy love to me. [Exit Spalatro, R. H. Enter Colonna, Officer, and eight Guards, L. H. Col. Conduct me to my dungeon!âI have parted From all that bound my bosom to the worldâ Ludovico!â Lud. The same. Col. Come you, my lord, To swill with drunken thirst, the poor revenge That makes a little mind's ignoble joy? Lud. Guards! I discharge Colonna from your care; He is no more your prisonerâHence! [Exeunt Officer and Guards, L. H. My lord, Such is the vengeance of Ludovico! Col. What is a man doomed to the stroke of death To understand by this? Lud. That I am his friend Who called me traitor! Col. Such I call you still. Lud. Well then, I am a traitor. Col. There is here A kind of marvellous honesty, my lord. Lud. In you 'twas nobleness to bear the charge, And yet 'twas glory to deserve it too. Your father was the tutor of the king, And loyalty is your inheritanceâ I am not blind to such exalted virtue, And I resolved to win Colonna's heart, As hearts like his are won!âUnto the king Soon as Vicentio's fate had reached mine ear, I hastened and implored your life. Col. My life!â Well, sir, my life?â (With indifference.) Lud. Upon my knees I fell, Nor can I speak the joy that in my heartâ Leaped, when I heard him say, that thou shouldst live. Col. I am loth to owe you gratitude, my lord, But, for my sister's sake, whom I would not Leave unprotected on the earth, I thank you! Lud. You have no cause to thank me; for, Colonna, He did pronounce your death, e'en as he said He gave you life. Col. I understand you not. Lud. Your honour's death, Colonna, which I hold The fountain of vitality. Col. Go on! I scarce did hear what did concern my life, But aught that touches honourâ Lud. Oh! Colonna, I almost dread to tell thee! Col. Prithee, speak! You put me on the rack! Lud. Wilt thou promise me,â I will not ask thee to be calm, Colonna,â Wilt promise me, that thou wilt not be mad? Col. Whate'er it be, I will contain myself. You said 'twas something that concern'd mine honour, The honour of mine houseâhe did not dare To say my blood should by a foul attaint Be in my veins corrupted; from their height The mouldering banners of my family, Flung to the earth; the 'scutcheons of my fame Trod by dishonour's foot, and my great race Struck from the list of nobles? Lud. No, Colonna, Struck from the list of men!âhe dared to ask As a condition for thy life, (my tongue Doth falter as I speak it, and my heart Can scarcely heave) by heavens he dared to ask That, to his foul and impious clasp, thou shouldst Yield up thy sisterâ Col. Ha! Lud. The king doth set a price Upon thy life, and 'tis thy sister's honour. Col. My sister! Lud. Aye, thy sister! Col. What!âmy sister! Lud. Yes!âyour sister, sir,âEvadne! Col. By yon heaven, Tho' he were born with immortality, I will find some way to kill him! My sister! Lud. Do not waste in idle wrathâ Col. My fathers! do you hear it in the tomb? Do not your mouldering remnants of the earth Feel horrid animation in the grave, And strive to burst the ponderous sepulchre, And throw it off?âMy sister! oh! yon heavens! Was this reserved for me? for me!âthe son Of that great man that tutored him in arms, And loved him as myself?âI know you wonder That tears are dropping from my flaming eye-lids; But 'tis the streaming of a burning heart, And these are drops of fireâmy sister! Lud. Nowâ Do you now call me traitor? Do you think 'Twas such a crime from off my country's heart To fling this incubus of royalty?â Am I a traitor? is't a sin, my lord, To think a dagger were of use in Naples? Col. Thou shalt not touch a solitary hair Upon the villain's head!âhis life is mine; His heart is grown my propertyâLudovico, None kills him but myself!âI will, this moment, Amid the assembled court, in face of day, Rush on the monster, and without a sword Tear him to pieces!â(Going, L. H.) Lud. Nay, Colonna, Within his court he might perchance escape you,â But, if you do incline to do a deed Antiquity would envy,âwith the means He hath furnished you himself!âHe means, Colonna, In your own house that you should hold to-night A glorious revelry, to celebrate Your sovereign's sacred presence; and so soon As all the guests are parted, you yourself Should lead your sister to himâ Col. That I should Convert the palace of mine ancestors Into a place of brothelryâmyself!â Tell me no more, I prithee, if thou wouldst I should be fit for death!â Lud. In honour be A Roman, an Italian in revenge. Waste not in idle or tempestuous sound Thy great resolve. The king intends to bear The honour of his presence to your house,â Nay, hold!âI'll tell him you consentâhe straight Will fall into the snare, and then, Colonna, Make offering of his blood to thy revenge! Col. I thank thee for thy warningâ'tis well thought onâ I'll make my vengeance certain, and commend Thy wisdom in the counselling. Lud. Then, hie thee hence! And make meet preparation for the banquet. I'll straight return, and tell him you're all joy In the honour of his coming. Col. The rigourous muscles of my clenched hand Already feel impatience for the blow That strikes the crowned monster to the heart. [Exeunt; Col. L. H. Lud. R. H. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âA vast hall in Colonna's palace, filled with statues.âThe moon streams in through the gothic windows, and appears to fall upon the statues. A chamber-door at the back. Enter Ludovico and the King, R. H. D. Lud. This is the way, my liege. Colonna bade me Conduct you to your chamber, while he went To seek the fair Evadne, and conduct Her soft reluctance to your highness' arms. King. Ludovico, thou hast proved thyself to-day The genius of my happier destiny: Thee must I thank, for 'twas thy rarer wit Did guide me on to heaven. Lud. I'll send you there. (Aside.) King. When first I heard Vicentio fell beneath The hot Colonna's sword, I do confess It smote me sore, but now 'tis told abroad That he hath passed all peril. Lud. I am glad His death doth not conduct you to your joysâ Vicentio bears a slight unharming wound, That sheds his blood, but perils not his life: But let him passâlet not a thought of him Flit round the couch of love. King. Good night, my friend, And prithee, bid Colonna swiftly lead her To the expecting transports of my heart. Lud. I will bid him speed her coyness. King. Hie thee, Ludovico, For every moment seems an age. [Exit into chamber, M. D. Lud. An age! For you, nor minute, hour, nor day, nor year, Nor age, shall shortly be. 'Tis now the dead of nightâThat sounds to me Like an apt word,âfor nature doth to me Shew like a giant corse.âThis mighty world, Its wide and highly-vaulted sepulchre, And yonder moon a tomb-lamp! when the king Lies dead to boot, all things will then appear In a more full proportion.âHa! he comes! My dull and unconscious instrument!âColonna! Enter Colonna with a dagger, R. H. D. Welcome, my friend, for such I dare to call you.â The king's already to his bed retired, Where death will be his paramour. Col. I have heard Vicentio was not wounded unto deathâ Would this were sooner known! Lud. Why, my good lord? Col. Because the king would not have offered me Such an indignity, nor should I now Tread into murder. Lud. MurderâI had hoped, You would not on the threshold of the deed Stay tottering thusâOne would deem It was a deed of sin, and not of honour, That you had undertaken. Col. By you heaven, I cannot stab him like a slave that's hired To be a blood-shedder! I cannot clench This hand, accustomed to a soldier's sword, Around this treacherous hilt, and with the other Squeeze the choked spirit from the gasping throatâ Then kneel upon his bosom, and press out The last faint sigh of life! Down, damned steel! Fit instrument for cowardsâ(Throws down the dagger near R. H.)âI will play A warrior's part, and arm him for the fight!â Give me thy sword, that I may put defence Into the tyrant's hand, and nobly kill him.â Come forth! (Going to D. F.) Lud. Hold, madman, hold!âwhat wouldst thou do? Col. Bravely encounter himânot take his life Like a mercenary stabber. Lud. Hast thou thought That he may be the victor too? Col. My death Will not be thought inglorious. Lud. There's some praise In falling by the hand of royalty; But when you are laid within your sepulchre, And rot most honourably, then I fear me, A lesser shame will not befall your house For all the graven marbles on your tomb! Your sisterâ Col. Ha! Lud. Your sister will not find, When you are dead, a bulwark in your grave, Where will she find a guardian armâthine arm Will be the food of the consuming worm, While in the hot embraces of the kingâ Col. I did not think on that. Lud. But I perhaps mistake you all this whileâ You had better thought upon the dignity He means your house. Col. You do not dareâ Lud. I dare to tell you thisâ Who can forgive such injury as thine, Hath half consented to it.âHow is it The glorious resolve hath cooled within thee? Hath any thing befallen that should have blown On the red iron of thy heated wrath, And steeped thee back to meekness?âWas the touch Of his warm amorous hand, wherein he palmed Her struggling fingers, ice upon your rage? When he did tread upon her yielding foot Beneath the cloth of goldâ Col. If I had seen it, He had not lived an instant! Lud. When you turned, He flung his arms around, and on her cheek He pressed his ravenous lips!â'Sdeath, sir, considerâ You pray the King of Naples to your roof,â You hail his coming in a feast that kings Could scarce exceed in gloryâIt is blown Thro' all the city that he sleeps to-night Within your sister's bed; and, it is said, That you, yourself, have smoothed the pillow down. Col. Where is he? let me see him who presumes To think the blasphemy. Lud. Behold him here! I, sirâyes, IâLudovico, dare think With every man in Naples, if the king Should leave your roof with life, that he has tasted The fruit he came to pluck. Col. No moreâno moreâ He perishes, Ludovico! Lud. That's wellâ I am glad to see you pull into your heart (Crosses and takes up the dagger.) Its brave resolve againâand if there be Aught wanting to confirm thee, think, Colonna, Think that you give your country liberty, While you revenge yourself!âGo, my Colonnaâ Yonder's the fated chamberâplunge the steel (Gives the dagger to Colonna.) Into his inmost heart, and let the blood Flow largely. Col. I'll call to thee when it is done. Lud. Hark thee! he'll cry for lifeâand well I know The pleading for existence may have power Upon thy noble natureâthen, Colonna, Drown every shriek with chaste Evadne's name, And stab him as thou criest it! [Exit, R. H. D. (Colonna advances towards the chamber-door in centre.) Col. I will do it!â (He pushes the door, and finds, from his agitated condition it is difficult to move.) I can scarce move the doorâit will not yield! It seems as if some mighty hand were laid Against it to repel me. (Voice exclaims, L. H. U. E.) Hold! Col. (Starting.) It was only My thought informed the air with voice around meâ Why should I feel as if I walked in guilt And trod to common murderâhe shall die! Come then, enraging thought, into my breast And turn it into iron! (Voice, L. H. U. E.) Hold! Col. It shot With keen reality into mine ear. A figure in the shadow of the moon, Moves slowly on my sight. What art thou? Evadne advances, L. H. U. E. from behind the Statues. Evad. My brother! Col. How, my sister! Come you across my purpose? Evad. From my chamber That to the great hall leads, I did behold you, In dreadful converse with Ludovico.â Your looks at the banquet did unto my fears Forbode no blessed issue, for your smiles Seemed veils of death, and underneath your brows I saw the silent furiesâOh, Colonna,â Thank heaven, the safety of Vicentio Has given me power to watch your dangerous steps! What would you do? Col. Get thee to rest. Evad. Is that high front, Colonna, One to write Cain upon?âAlas, Colonna, I did behold you with Ludovico, By yonder moon, and I as soon had seen thee Commune with the great foe of all mankindâ What wouldst thou do? Col. Murder! Evad. What else, Colonna, Couldst thou have learned from Ludovico? Col. In yonder chamber lies the kingâI go To stab him to the heart! Evad. 'Tis nobly done! I will not call him kingâbut guest, Colonnaâ Remember, you have called him hereâremember You have pledged him in your father's golden cup; Have broken bread with himâthe man, Colonna,â Col. Who dares to set a price upon my lifeâ What think'st thou 'twas? Evad. I think there's nought too dear To buy Colonna's life. Col. 'Twas a vast price He asked me thenâyou were to pay it tooâ It was my Evadne's honour. Evad. Ha! Col. He gives my life upon conditionâOh, my sister, I am ashamed to tell thee what he asked. Evad. What! did he?â Col. Thou dost understand me now?â Nowâif thou wilt, abide thee here, Evadne, Where thou mayest hear his groan. (Going in.) Evad. Forbear, Colonna! For heaven's sake, stayâthis was the price he asked thee? He asked thee for thy life?âthy life?âbut, noâ Vicentio lives, andâ Col. (Aside.) How is this? She seems To bear too much of woman in her heart; She tremblesâyet she does not shrinkâher cheek Is not inflamed with anger, and her eye Darts not the lightning!â Evad. Oh! my dearest brother, Let not this hand, this pure, this white fair hand, Be blotted o'er with blood. Col. (Aside.) Why, is it possible, She has ta'en the sinful wish into her heart? By heaven, her pride is dazzled at the thought Of having this same purple villain kneel, And bend his crown before herâShe's a woman Evadne! Evad. Well? Col. The king expects me to Conduct you to his chamberâShall I do so? Evad. I prithee, be not angry at my prayerâ But bid him come to me. Col. What! bid him come to thee? Evad. And leave me with him here. Col. What! leave thee with him? Evad. YesâI implore it of theeâprithee, Colonna, Conduct my sovereign here. Col. YesâI will try herâ I know not what she means, but, hitherto, I deemed her virtuous. If she fall, she dies. I'll here conceal myself, and if in word She give consent, I'll rush upon them both And strike one heart thro' the other.â(Aside.) Evad. Send him to me. Col. There's a wild purpose in her solemn eyeâ I know not if 'tis sin, but I will make A terrible experiment.â(Aside.)âWhat, ho! My liege, I bear fulfilment of my promiseâ Colonna bears Evadne to your arms! Enter the King from the chamber, M. D. King. Colonna, my best friend, how shall I thank thee? But where is my Evadne? Col. There, my lord! King. Colonna, I not only give thee life, But place thee near myself; henceforth thou wilt wear A nobler title in thy family,â And to thy great posterity we'll send My granted dukedom. Col. Sir you honour me. My presence is no longer needed here. (Aside.)âA word's consent despatches them! (Conceals himself behind the pillars, R. H. U. E.) King. My fair Evadne! lay aside thy sad And drooping aspect in this hour of joy! Stoop not thy head, that like a pale rose bends Upon its yielding stalkâthou hast no cause For such a soft abashment, for be sure I'll place thee high in honour. Evad. (L. H.) Honour, sir!â King. (R. H.) Yes; I'll exalt thee into dignity, Adorn thy name with titlesâAll my court Shall watch the movement of thy countenance, Riches and power shall wait upon thy smile, And in the lightest bending of thy brow Death and disgrace inhabit. Evad. And, my liege, That will inhabit my own heart! King. My love! Come, my Evadneâwhat a form is here? The imaginers of beauty did of old O'er three rich forms of sculptured excellence Scatter the naked graces; but the hand Of mightier nature hath in thee combined All varied charms together. Evad. You were speaking Of sculpture, sirâI do remember me, You are deemed a worshipper of that high art, Here, my lord, (Pointing to the statues.) Is matter for your transports! King. Fair Evadne! Do you not mean to mock me? Not to gaze On yonder lifeless marbles did I come To visit you to-night, but in the pure, And blue-veined alabaster of a breast, Richer than heaves the Parian that has wed The Florentine to immortality. Evad. You deem me of a light capricious mood, But it were hard if, (woman as I am) I could not use my sex's privilegeâ Tho' I should ask you for yon orb of light, That shines so brightly, and so sadly there, And fills the ambient air with purityâ Should you not fain, as 'tis the wont of those Who cheat a wayward child, to draw it down, And in the sheeted splendour of a stream To catch its shivering brightness!âIt is my pleasure That you should look upon these reverend forms, That keep the likeness of mine ancestryâ I must enforce you to it!â King. Wayward woman! What arts does she intend to captivate My soul more deeply in her toils? Evad. Behold! (Going to a statue, R. H. S. E.) The glorious founder of my family! It is the great Rodolpho!âCharlemagne Did fix that sun upon his shield, to be His glory's blazoned emblem; for at noon, When the astronomer cannot discern A spot upon the full-orbed disk of light, 'Tis not more bright than his immaculate name! With what austere, and dignified regard He lifts the type of purity, and seems Indignantly to ask, if aught that springs From blood of his, shall dare to sully it With a vapour of the morning! King. It is well; His frown has been attempered in the lapse Of generations, to thy lovely smile.â I swear, he seems not of thy family. My fair Evadne, I confess, I hoped Another sort of entertainment here. Evad. Another of mine ancestors, my liegeâ (Pointing to a statue, L. H. U. E.) Guelfo the murderer! King. The murderer! I knew not that your family was stained With the reproach of blood. Evad. We are not wont To blush, tho' we may sorrow for his sin, If sin indeed it be. His castle walls Were circled by the siege of Saracens,â He had an only daughter whom he prized More than you hold your diadem; but when He saw the fury of the infidels Burst through his shattered gates, and on his child Dishonour's hand was lifted, with one blow He struck her to the heart, and with the other, He stretched himself beside her. King. Fair Evadne, I must no more indulge you, else I fear You would scorn me for my patience; prithee, love, No more of this wild phantasy! Evad. My liege, But one remains, and when you have looked upon it, And thus complied with my request, you will find me Submissive to your own. Look here, my lord,â Know you this statue? (Pointing to a statue, L. H. S. E. King. No, in sooth, I do not. Evad. Nayâlook againâfor I shall think but ill Of princely memories, if you can find Within the inmost chambers of your heart No image like to thisâlook at that smileâ That smile, my liegeâlook at it! King. It is your father! Evad. (Breaking into exultation.) Aye!â'tis indeed my father!â'tis my good, Exalted, generous, and god-like father! Whose memory, though he had left his child A naked, houseless roamer through the world, Were an inheritance a princess might Be proud of for her dower! Who was my father? (With a proud and conscious interrogatory.) King. One, whom I confess Of high and many virtues. Evad. Is that all? I will help your memory, and tell you first, That the late King of Naples looked among The noblest in his realm for that good man, To whom he might intrust your opening youth, And found him worthiest. In the eagle's nest Early he placed you, and beside his wing You learned to mount to glory! Underneath His precious care you grew, and were once Thought grateful for his service. His whole life Was given to your uses, and his deathâ Ha! do you start, my lord? On Milan's plain He fought beside you, and when he beheld A sword thrust at your bosom, rushedâit pierced him! He fell down at your feet,âhe did, my lord! He perished to preserve you!â(Rushes to the statue.)âBreathless image, Altho' no heart doth beat within that breast, No blood is in those veins, let me enclasp thee, And feel thee at my bosom.âNow, sir, I am readyâ Come and unloose these feeble arms, and take me!â Aye, take me from this neck of senseless stone,â And to reward the father with the meet And wonted recompense that princes giveâ Make me as foul as bloated pestilence, As black as darkest midnight, and as vile As guilt and shame can make me. King. She has smitten Compunction thro' my soul! Evad. Approach, my lord! Come in the midst of all mine ancestry, Come and unloose me from my father's armsâ Come, if you dare, and in his daughter's shame Reward him for the last drops of the blood Shed for his prince's life!â King. Thou hast wrought A miracle upon thy prince's heart, And lifted up a vestal lamp, to shew My soul its own deformityâmy guilt! Evad. (Disengaging herself from the statue.) Ha! have you got a soul?âhave you yet left, Prince as you are, one relic of a man? Have you a soul?âhe tremblesâhe relentsâ I read it in the glimmering of his face; And there's a tear, the bursting evidence Of nature's holy working in the heart! Oh, heav'n! he weeps! my sovereign, my liege Heart! do not burst in ecstacy too soon! My brother! my Colonna!âhear meâhear! In all the wildering triumph of my soul, I call upon thee! (Turning, she perceives Colonna advancing from among the statues, R. H. U. E.) There he isâmy brother! Col. (In centre.) Let me behold thee, Let me compress thee here!âOh! my dear sister! A thousand times mine own!âI glory in thee, More than in all the heroes of my name!â I overheard your converse, and methought It was a blessed spirit that had ta'en Thy heavenly form, to shew the wondering world How beautiful was virtue!âSir,â (To the king.) Evad. (L. H.) Colonna, There is your king! Col. Thou hast made him so again! Thy virtue hath re-crowned himâand I kneel His faithful subject here! King. (R. H.) Arise, Colonna! You take the attitude that more befits The man who would have wrong'd you, but whose heart, Was by a seraph call'd again to heaven! Forgive me! Col. Yes, with all my soul I do! And I will give you proof how suddenly You are grown my Prince again.âDo not inquire What I intend, but let me lead you here Behind these statues.â (Places the king behind the statues, R. H. U. E.) Retire, my best Evadne! [Exit Evadne, L. H. Ho! Ludovico! What ho! there!âHere he comes! Enter Ludovico, R. H. Ludovico, I have done the deed.â Lud. He is dead? Col. Thro' his heart E'en as thou badest me, did I drive the steel, And as he cried for life, Evadne's name Drowned his last shriek! Lud. So! Col. Why, Ludovico, Stand you thus rapt? Why does your bosom heave In such wild tumult? Why is it you place Your hand upon your front? What hath possessed you? Lud. (With a strong laugh of irony.) Fool! Col. How is this? Lud. So, thou hast slain the king? Col. I did but follow your advice, my lord. Lud. Therefore, I call yeâfool!âFrom the king's head Thou hast ta'en the crown, to place it on mine own! Therefore I touched my front, for I did think That palpably, I felt the diadem Wreathing its golden round about my brow! But, by yon heaven, scarce do I feel more joy In climbing up to empire, than I do In knowing thee my dupe! Col. I know, my lord, You bade me kill the king. Lud. And since thou hast slain him, Know moreâ'twas I that first within his heart Lighted impurity;â'twas I, Colonna,â Hear itâ'twas I that did persuade the king To ask thy sister's honour, as the price Of thine accorded life! Col. You?â Lud. Wouldst hear more?â To-morrow sees me king! I have already Prepared three thousand of my followers To call me to the throneâand when I am there, I'll try thee for the murdering of the king,â And thenâWhat ho, there! Guards!âthen, my good lord, When the good trenchant axe hath struck away That dull, and passionate head of thineâWhat ho!â Enter Officer and Eight Guards, R. H. D. I'll take the fair Evadne to mine arms, And thusâ On yonder traitor seize!â With sacrilegious hand he has ta'en away The consecrated life of majesty, Andâ The King comes forward in centre, R. H. U. E. What do I behold? is not my sense Mocked with this horrid vision? That hath started up To make an idiot of me;âis it not The vapour of the senses that has framed The only spectacle that ever yet Appalled Ludovico?â King. Behold thy king! Lud. He lives!âI am betrayedâbut let me not Play traitor to myself:âbefriend me still Thou guarding genius of Ludovico!â My liege, my royal master, do I see you Safe from the plots of yon accursed traitor? And throwing thus myself around your knees Do I clasp reality? King. Traitor, arise! Nor dare pollute my garment with a touch! I know thee for a villain!âSeize him, guards! Lud. (Drawing his sword.) By this right arm they dare notâthis right arm That to the battle oft hath led them on, Whose power to kill they know, but would not feel!â I am betrayedâbut who will dare to leap Into the pit wherein the lion's caught, And hug with him for death? Not one of this Vile herd of trembling wretches! (To the King.) Thou art meet alone to encounter me, And thus in the wild bravery of despair, I rush into thy life! Col. (Intercepts and stabs him.âLudovico falls.) Lud. Colonna, thou hast conquered. Oh! that I could, Like an expiring dragon, spit upon you!â That I couldâthus I fling the drops of life In showers of poison on youâMay it fall Like Centaur-blood, and fester you to madness! Oh! that I couldâ(He grasps his sword, and, in an effort to rise, dies.) Enter Evadne, L. H. and crosses to Colonna. Evad. Oh! my brother! King. Thou hast a second time preserv'd thy prince! Fair Evadne, We will repair our injuries to thee, And wait in all the pomp of royalty Upon the sacred day that gives thy hand To thy beloved Vicentio! Col. And the nuptials Shall at the pedestal be solemnized Of our great father! Evad. And ever, as in this blest moment, may His guardian spirit, with celestial love Spread its bright wings to shelter us from ill, With nature's tenderest feelings looking down Benignant on the fortunes of his child!

      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, SPOKEN BY MRS. FAUCIT. Drop Scene.âThe Hall of Dramatic Statues. Sent hither by our bard, no pleasant jauntâ In epilogue a timorous debutante, I ask your favour, like a prudent elf, One word for him, and one word for myself! Cut off, like Crusoe, from the social walk, With no Man Friday to keep up the talk Frown'd on by yonder monumental sagesâ(Pointing to the Drop.) In marble. What an awful thing the stage is! Of Thespian bards yon Alpha and Omega, From mighty Shakspeare down to Lope de Vega; Each shakes his awful curls, and seems to say,â âSurely the author means to damn his play; What! send an actress out, the town t'implore, Who never spoke an epilogue before! Olivia for Evadne,âmighty clever! Woman for woman! that is new, however!â Peace, ye monopolists, on marble shelves, You want to damn all statues but yourselves. Avaunt! âI've caught the speaker's eyeâ before ye, Rear-rank, attention! while I tell a story. Pygmalion once, to ape the turner's trade, With curious labour carved an ivory maid, But as immortal grace each limb unfolds, He glows with passion for the maid he moulds, And cries, (how vain were artists e'en in Greece) âCome! that's a statue! that's art's masterpiece!â Long he adores her with a lover's mien, And thus, at length, petitions beauty's queen; âOh, Venus, bid me taste of Hymen's bliss, And âbone of my boneâ make yon ivory miss! Hush! foolish youth!â (aside thus Momus sung) âLeave well alone! a statue has no tongue!â Vain was the hint; the silliest of the Greeks Repeats his vow, and gains the boon he seeks. The statue woke to life, with eager spring Pygmalion changed his chisel for a ring; And as no parent lived to thwart his plans, Of course no cross papa forbade the banns. From that time forth, unwarmed by lover's breath, Statues, or bone, or stone, have slept in death. But if to-night, you bid Evadne thrive, We hope to see the miracle revive. To beauty's queen the Grecian poured his vow, Our poet bends to beauty's daughters now; Oh! may they waken his dramatic wife, And, smiling, warm his statue into life!</field>
