      <field name="fulltext">Actus prim?????? Philogones. E[up]???? Phi. The vnfayned frendshippe and honest demenior Which I in yow dere Eupelas haue always p[r]oved, To render vnto yow some parte of the tenoure Of my mynde at this tyme espetiallye hath moved. Hopinge therby that some what I shall fynde By your godly counsayle and lovinge exhortation, Wherof presently my pensive hart and mynde May feele some comforte and consolation. Good counsayle yow knowe to a minde wt h care oppreste Is like to holsome medicine taken at nede, Which helpeth the stomacke evell humoures to digest Lest therof at any tyme some malledey may brede. Wherfore I request yow o trusty frende Eupelas To minister to my greife such medicine as yow may, Promisinge the like to yow in like case Yf at anye tyme yow nede in any assay. Eu. Right [wor]thy Philogonvs my trusty fidelitye And frendly behaviour to yow from my youth, Hath not bene so great as your curtuous humanity To me warde hath ever deserved of a truth. For your demerites hath always bene such To pleasure me in any thinge that possibly yow might, That I can thinke no payne or laboure to much To pleasure yow agayne by day or by nig[ht] And woulde to god I knewe that cordiall confection were it never so costlye in Italye to be soulde, wc h woulde ease yow of this dolorous affection Yow shoulde haue it thoughe the price were a talent of goulde. Otherwise to giue yow good counsayle and advise Is a harde thinge to him which hath no such science Tis the part yow knowe of philosophers that be wise Which study for the same with great care and diligens. Wher albeit how muche as my abillitie doth wante So much true amitye the lake shall supply My loue is perfett thoughe my cuninge be but scant Say one therfore I will answere accordinglye. Phi. With condinge thankes for your gentle oration Your modesty herin I doe greatly commende Refusinge those titles wherof the probation Even the denial it selfe doth extende. Wherfore to be short I will shewe yow my grevaun[ce] &amp; what is the drifte and intente of my reason Desiringe yow a while to giue hedy attenda[unce] A ?? then as shalbe meete to aunswer in ?????? ???????????? [man] hath in this mortall life ???????[ng]e the ioyes wc h in Christe we obtayne [C]onsisteth in true lovinge children and wife wc h lovingly at all tymes together should remayne. And so by the contrary always doth arise By discordes I meane and dissention in thos Such peteous harte breakes as none can devise No pen can discrive no tounge can disclose. I had one I speake by experience to trewe So faythfull a mate and so honest a spouse The lake wherof often pore wretch I doe rewe As not whole Laurentum a better can house. But hir crwell death sith thence longe hath slayne And me of my trwe loue the fates hath bereft Who yet for my comfort with me to remayne A motherles infante of ther curtesye left. Whome first in his youth I did fatherly tender The more bycause hir he did much represente I cokred and dandled him a great while the lenger Wherof like a foole to late I repente. I coulde not suffer the coulde winde to blowe Without happing and lappinge my younglinge to much What correction was he never did knowe No man durst skars this wagge wanton tuch An vnwise man I was for thus then I thoughte what nede he tuters or masters to haue for larninge &amp; discipline he shall not care oughte he shall learne to looke bigge stand stoute &amp; go braue. What shoulde I doe wt h my landes and possessions I am able to kepe him gentleman wise I esteme not gr?mer and thes latine lessones let them studye such which of meaner sort rise And as for his conditions I am sure they will be both honest and gentle as all his kinne were the like bredes the like (eche man sayd) to me his nature to be good yow nede not to feare With thes fonnde perswations I flattered my selfe nuslinge him wt h libertye in youth like a dawe Til in prossis of tyme the malipert elfe [Este]med me not the vallue of a strawe And the more he percevyd I loved him [th]?? the lesse he regarded my w[ordes] everye day the gentler I vsed him the m[ore he] begann stubbernly to contemne me for all I coulde say. And nowe since he is groune to stripplinge yeares he is waxt so stomackfull and hautye of mynde that nether god nor mann nor anye thinge he feares he settes me as light as a fether in the wynde A company of knaves he hath also on his hande wc h leades him to all manner leaudnes apace wt h harlottes and varlottes and baudes he is mande to the gallouce I feare me he is treaddinge the trace. Eu. Alas good Philogonvs it pittyeth me sore to see yow my dere frende in this heavye plight comforte your selfe I pray yow wepe no more the worst is I warrent yow but a litle frite. And consider I beseche yow the comfortable wordes wc h Christ our savioure hath left vs in store: who all gripinge greifes his testament recordes, will mitigate in thos wc h followe his lore. And what thoughe your sonne doth spende his youthfull days in dulishe delightes and riatous excesse he will not continue in that trade allways in tyme he him selfe will his manners redresse. He goeth farr that never tournes agayne as folke say I coulde tell yow of many that haue gone as wyde the best of vs all before god goeth astraye and he that stande surest may fortune to slyde. Wherfore be not dismaide all oute righte but comforte your selfe and hope still the best plucke vp your hart man recover your mighte to doe for yow what I can I will not rest. Phi. Lorde how my spirites by your talke are appeased nothinge I see well to a frende may be counted my stomacke is lightned my minde is well eased all treasures trwe frendshipp I perceve fare sermounted. And if I mighte see that thinge come to passe wc h yow as yow woulde haue deuinid er[e whi]le no man how much happier so ever he was woulde sowner all pensivenes &amp; cares qu[it]e exile. ???????? [I] doubt that [such] depnes of route ??????? [an]d idlenes i[n his] mind hath framed ???? [sel]dome or nea[r they] will cleane be pluckt out [I fea]re me I feare me he will near be reclamed. [Eu.] And why should yow so doubt. declare me the cause is his yeares so far spent that no good can be done he will not (if yow say) is no reasonable clause I hope t[o] persuade him and that right sone. Phi. Perswade him (quoth yow) nay if he had that grace by persuation to amend his leude behaveoure my persuation I trowe woulde haue taken some place wc h alwayes I vttered wt h lenitye and favour Eu. With to to much favour I thinke a great dele which caused him so lightly yow to esteme. but what thoughe with favourable meanes I will fele Yf yet I can make him the tyme to redeme. Phi. Your sayinge is to trwe but what yf in fine he neglecteth your wordes with contempt and disdayne as often tymes heretofore he hath done myne when I would with gentle meanes haue wone him full fayne. Eu. It is not likly that he shoulde obbrayde. a man wc h exhortes him to such a good thinge yf he should perhaps I would make him afrayde with conscience and dewty &amp; lawes of the kinge. Phi. This devise Eupelas I like best of all but vse your discretion in everye attempt he is a sturdy marchant sticke not to brawle if he doe misvse with any contempt Eu. But tell me I pray yow what age is he nowe is he so headstronge that he can not be tamed I warrant yow weil make him both bend &amp; bowe we wil in deede (feare not) or weil make him ashamed. Phi. An endlesse laboure you then go aboute can you bende a bigge tree wc h is sappy &amp; sound he is to olde I tell yow to stubberne &amp; to stoute take hede what yow say lest he lay yow on ye ground.
