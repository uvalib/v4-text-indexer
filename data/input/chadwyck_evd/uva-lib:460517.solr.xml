      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. Enter Marlowe and Heywood. Hey. Be sure of it. Mar. I am; but not by your light. Hey. I speak it not in malice, nor in envy Of your good fortune with so bright a beauty; But I have heard such things! Mar. Good Master Heywood, I prithee plague me not with what thou'st heard; I've seen, and I do love herâand, for hearing, The music of her voice is in my soul, And holds a rapturous jubilee 'midst dreams That melt the day and night into one bliss. Hey. Beware the waking hour! Mar. In lovely glory, Like all that's fabled of Olympus' queen, She movesâas if the earth were undulant clouds, And all its flowers her subject stars. Hey. Proceed. Mar. Smile not; for 'tis most true: the very air With her sweet presence is impregnate richly. As in a mead, that's fresh with youngest green, Some fragrant shrub, some secret herb, exhales Ambrosial odours; or in lonely bower, Where one may find the musk-plant, heliotrope, Geranium, or grape-hyacinth, confers A ruling influence, charming present sense, And sure of memory; so, her person bears A natural balm, obedient to the rays Of heavenâor to her own, which glow within, Distilling incense by their own sweet power. The dew at sun-rise on a ripen'd peach Was never more delicious than her neck. Such forms are Nature's favorites. Hey. Come, comeâ Pygmalion and Prometheus dwell within you! You poetize her rarely, and exalt With goddess-attributes, and chastity Beyond most goddesses: be not thus serious! If for a passing paramour thou'dst love her, Why, so, it may be well; but never place Thy full heart in her hand. Mar. I haveâI doâ And I will lay it bleeding at her feet. Reason no more, for I do love this woman: To me she's chaste, whatever thou hast heard. Whatever I may hear, know, find, or fancy, I must possess her constantly, or die. Hey. Nay, if't be thus, I'll fret thine ear no more With raven voice; but aid thee all I can. Mar. Cecilia!âgo, dear friendâgood Master Heywood, Leave me aloneâI see her coming hither. Hey. Bliss wait thy wooing; peace of mind its end! (Aside.) His knees shake, and his face and hands are wet, As with a sudden fall of dewâGod speed him! This is a desperate fancy! [Exit. Enter Cecilia. Cec. Thoughtful sir, How fare you? thou'st been reading much of late By the moon's light, I fear me? Mar. Why so, lady? Cec. The reflex of the page is on thy face. Mar. But in my heart the spirit of a shrine Burns, with immortal radiation crown'd. Cec. Nay, primrose gentleman, think'st me a saint? Mar. I feel thy power. Cec. I exercise no artsâ Whence is my influence? Mar. From heaven, I think. Madam, I love youâere to-day you've seen it, Although my lips ne'er breathed the word before; And seldom as we've met, and briefly spoken, There are such spiritual passings to and fro 'Twixt thee and meâtho' I alone may sufferâ As make me know this love blends with my life; Must branch with it, bud, blossom, put forth fruit, Nor end e'en when its last husks strew the grave, Whence we together shall ascend to bliss. Cec. Continued from this world. Mar. Thy handâboth hands; I kiss them from my soul. Cec. Nay, sirâyou burn meâ Let loose my hands. Mar. I loose themâhalf my life has thus gone from meâ That which is left can scarce sustain my heart, Now grown too full with the high tide of joy, Whose ebb, retiring, fills the caves of sorrow, Where Syrens sing beneath their dripping hair And raise the mirror'd fate. Cec. Then, gaze not in it, Lest thou should'st see thy passing funeral. I would notâI might chance to see far worse. Mar. Thou art too beautiful ever to die! I look upon thee, and can ne'er believe it. Cec. O, sirâbut passion, circumstance and fate Can do far worse than killâthey can dig graves, And make the future owners dance above them, Well knowing how 'twill end. Why look you sad? 'Tis not your case: you are a man in loveâ At least you say soâand should therefore feel A constant sunshine, wheresoe'er you tread, Nor think of what's beneath. But speak no more: I see a volume gathering in your eye Which you would fain have printed in my heart; But you were better cast it in the fire. Enough you've said, and I enough have listened. Mar. I have said nought. Cec. You have spoken very plainâ So, Master Marlowe, please you break we off; And, since your mind is now relievedâgood day! Mar. Leave me not thus!âforgive me! Cec. For what offence? Mar. The expression of my love. Cec. Tut! that's a trifle. Think'st thou I ne'er saw men in love before? Unto the summer of beauty they are as common As grasshoppers. Mar. And to its winter, lady? Cec. There is no winter in my thoughtsâadieu! [Exit. Mar. She's gone!âHow leafless is my life!âMy strength Seems meltedâmy breast vacantâand in my brain I hear the sound of a retiring sea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. Enter Heywood and Middleton. Mid. And yet it may end well, after his fit is over. Hey. But he is earnest in it. Mid. 'Tis his habit: a little thunder clears the atmosphere. At present he is spell-bound, and smouldereth in a hot cloud of passion; but when he once makes his way, he will soon again disperse his free spirit abroad over the inspired heavens. Hey. I fear me she will sow a train of feverish fancies in his mind that may go near to drive him mad. Mid. How so?âhe knoweth her for a courtezan, and Master Marlowe hath too deep a reading i'the books of nature to nail his heart upon a gilded weather-cock. He is only desperate after the fashion of a pearl-diver. When he hath enough he will desistâbreathe freely, polish the shells, and build grottoes. Hey. Nay, he persisteth in not knowing her for a courtezan âtalks of her purity in burning words, that seem to glow and enhance his love from his convictions of her virtue; then suddenly falls into silent abstraction, looking like a man whose eyes are filled with visions of paradise. No pains takes she to deceive him; for he supersedes the chance by deceiving himself beyond measure. He either listens not at all to intimation, or insists the contrary. Mid. This is his passionate aggravation or self-will: he must know it. Hey. 'Tis my belief; but her beauty blinds him with its beams, and drives his exiled reason into darkness. Mid. Here comes one that could enlighten his perception, methinks. Hey. Who's he? Oh, Jack-o'-night, the tavern-pimp. Enter Jacconot. Jac. Save ye, my masters; lusty thoughts go with ye, and a jovial full cup wait on your steps: so shall your blood rise, and honest women pledge ye in their dreams! Mid. Your weighty-pursed knowledge of women, balanced against your squinting knowledge of honesty, Master Jack-o'-night, would come down to earth, methinks, as rapid as a fall from a gallows-tree. Jac. Well said, Master Middletonâa merry devil and a long-lived one run monkey-wise up your back-bone! May your days be as happy as they're sober, and your nights full of applause! May no brawling mob pelt you when throned, nor hoot down your plays when your soul's pinned like a cock-chafer on public opinion! May no learned or unlearned calf write against your knowledge and wit, and no brother paper-stainer pilfer your pages, and then call you a general thief! Am I the only rogue and vagabond in the world? Mid. I'faith, not: nay, an' thou wert, there would be no lack of them i'the next generation. Thou might'st be the father of the race, being now the bodily type of it. Jac. That, for your type! [Exit Jacconot, hastily. Mid. Look!âsaid I not so? See whom 'tis he meets; And with a lounging, loose, familiar air, Cocking his cap, and setting his hand on's hip, Salutes with such free language as his action And attitude explain! Hey. I grieve for Marlowe: The more, since 'tis as certain he must have Full course of passion, as that its object's full Of most unworthy elements. Mid. Unworthy, Indeed, of such a form, if all be base. Nature, methinks, doth seldom so belie The inward by the outward; seldom frame A cheat so finish'd to ensnare the senses, And break our faith in all substantial truth. [Exeunt. Enter Cecilia, followed by Jacconot. Jac. Well, well, Mistress St Cecil; the money is all well enoughâI object nothing to the money. Cec. Then, go your ways. Jac. My ways are your waysâa murrain on your beauties! âhas your brain shot forth sky-larks as your eyes do sparks. Cec. Go!âhere is my purse. Jac. I'll no more of't!âI have a mind to fling back what thou'st already given me for my services. Cec. Master Jacconot, I would have no further services from thee. If thou art not yet satisfied, fetch the weight and scales, and I will cast my gold into it, and my dross besidesâ so shall I be doubly relieved. Jac. I say again, and the devil bear me fierce witness! it is not gold I want, but rightful favour; not silver, but sweet civility; not dross, but due respect to my nonpareil value! Bethink thee, Cecilâbethink thee of many things! Ay! am not I the true gallant of my time? the great Glow-worm and Will-o'-the-whispâthe life, the fortune, and the favorite of the brightest among ye! Cec. Go! Jac. Go!âa death's-head crown your pillow! May you dream of love, and wake and see that! Cec. I had rather see't than you. Jac. What's i'the wind?ânobleman, or gentleman, or a brain-fancyâam not I at hand? Are you mad? Cec. I'd gladly believe I have been so. Jac. Good. I'm content you see me aright once more, and acknowledge yourself wrong. And to me too! Bethink thee, I say, when last year after the dance at Hampton thou wert enraged against the noble that slighted thee; and, flushed with wine, thou took'st me by the ear, and mad'st me hand thee into thy coach, and get in beside thee, with a drawn sword in my hand and a dripping trencher on my head, singing such songs, untilâ Cec. Earth-worms and stone walls! Jac. Hey! what of them? Cec. I would that as the corporal Past they cover, They could, at earnest bidding of the will, Entomb in walls of darkness and devour The hated retrospections of the mind. Jac. (aside) Oho!âthe lamps and saw-dust!âHere's foul play And mischief in the market. Preaching varlet! I'll find him out. [Exit. Cec. Self-disgust Gnaws at the roots of being, and doth hang A heavy sickness on the beams of day, Making the atmosphere, which should exalt Our contemplations, press us down to earth, As though our breath had made it thick with plague. Cursed! accursed be the freaks of Nature, That mar us from ourselves, and make our acts The scorn and loathing of our after-thoughtsâ The finger-mark of Conscience, who, most treacherous, Wakes to accuse, but slumber'd o'er the sin. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. A room in a tavern: Marlowe, Heywood, Middleton, and Gentlemen. A Gent. I do rejoice to find myself among The choicest spirits of the age: health, sirs! I would commend your fame to future years, But that I know ere this ye must be old In the conviction, and that ye full oft With sure posterity have shaken hands Over the unstable bridge of present time. Mar. Not so: we write from the full heart within, And leave posterity to find her own. Health, sir!âyour good deeds laurel you in heaven! Mid. 'Twere best men left their fame to chance and fashion As birds bequeath their eggs to the sun's hatching, Since genius can make no will. Mar. Troth, can it! But, for the consequences of the deed, What fires of blind fatality may catch them! Say, you do love a womanâdo adore herâ You may embalm the memory of her worth And chronicle her beauty to all time, In words whereat great Jove himself might flush, And feel Olympus tremble at his thoughts; Yet where is your security? Some clerk Wanting a fool's-cap, or some boy a kite, Some housewife fuel, or some sportsman wadding To wrap a ball (which hits the poet's brain By merest accident) seizes your record, And to the winds thus scatters all your will, Or, rather, your will's object. Thus, our pride Swings like a planet by a single hair, Obedient to God's breath. More wine! more wine! I preachâand I grow melancholyâwine! Enter Drawer, with a tankard. A Gent. (rising). We're wending homewardâgentlemen, good night! Mar. Not yetânot yetâthe night has scarce begunâ Nay, Master HeywoodâMiddleton, you'll stay! Bright skies to those who goâhigh thoughts go with ye, And constant youth! Gent. We thank you, sirâgood night! [Exeunt Gentlemen. Hey. Let's followâ'tis near morning. Mar. Do not go. I'm ill at ease, touching a certain matter I've taken to heartâdon't speak of'tâand besides I have a sort of horror of my bed. Last night a squadron charged me in a dream, With Isis and Osiris at the flanks, Towering and waving their colossal arms, While in the van a fiery chariot roll'd, Wherein a woman stoodâI knew her wellâ Who seem'd but newly risen from the grave. She whirl'd a javelin at me, and methought I woke; when, slowly at the foot o'the bed The mist-like curtains parted, and upon me Did learned Faustus look! He shook his head With grave reproof, but more of sympathy, As though his past humanity came o'er himâ Then went away with a low, gushing sigh, That startled e'en his own cold breast, and seem'd As from a marble urn where passion's ashes Their sleepless vigil keep. Hey. Pray you, no more. Mar. Lived he not greatly! think what was his power! All knowledge at his beckâthe very Devil His common slave. And, oh! brought he not back, Through the thick-million'd catacombs of ages, Helen's unsullied loveliness to his arms! Mid. Wellâlet us have more wine then! Hey. Spirit enough Springs from thee, Master Marloweâwhat need more? Mar. Drawer! lift up thy slumberous poppy-head! Up, man!âwhere art? Hey. I hear his steps approach. Jacconot, singing outside, Ram up the link, boys; ho, boys! The inverted iron horns or tubes, a few of which still remain on lamp-posts and gates, were formerly used as extinguishers to the torches, which were thrust into them. There's day-light in the sky! While the trenchers strew the floor, And the worn-out grey-beards snore, Jolly throats continue dry! Ram up the link, boys, &amp;c. Enter Jacconot, with a full tankard. Jac. Ever awake and shining, my masters; and here am I, your twin lustre, always ready to herald and anoint your pleasures like a true Master of the Revels. I ha' just stepped over the drawer's body, laid nose and heels together on the doormat asleep, and here's wherewith to continue the glory. Mid. We need not your help. Hey. We thank you, Jack-o'-night: we would be alone. Jac. What say you, Master Marlowe? you look as grim as a sign-painter's first sketch on a tavern-bill after his ninth tankard. Mid. Cease your death-rattle, night-hawk! Mar. That's well said. Jac. Is it! so 'tis, my gallantsâa night-bird like yourselves, am I. Mar. Beast!âwe know you. Jac. Your merry health, Master Kit Marlowe! I'll bring a loud pair of palms to cheer your soul the next time you strut in red paint with a wooden weapon at your thigh. Mar. Who sent for you, dorr-hawk?âgo! Jac. Go! aha!âI remember the wordâsame tone, same gestureâor as like as the two profiles of a monkey, or as two squeaks for one pinch. Go!ânot Iâhere's to all your healths! One pull more! There, I've doneâtake it, Master Marlowe; and pledge me as the true knight of London's rarest beauties! Mar. I will! [Dashes the tankard at his head. Jac. (stooping quickly). A miss, 'fore-gad!âthe wall has got it! See, where it trickles down like the long robe of some dainty fair one. And look you hereâand there again, look youâwhat make you of the picture he hath presented? Mar. O subtle Nature! who hath so compounded Our senses, playing into each other's wheels, That feeling oft acts substitute for sight, As sight becomes obedient to the thoughtâ How can'st thou place such wonders at the mercy Of every wretch that crawls! I feelâI see! Jac. (singing). Ram up the link, boys; ho, boys! The blear-eyed morning's here; Let us wander through the streets, And kiss whoe'er one meets; St Cecil is my dear! Ram up the link, boys, &amp;c. Mar. (drawing). Lightning come up from hell and strangle thee! Mid. and Hey. Nay, Marlowe! Marlowe! [They hold him back. Mid. Away, thou bestial villain! Jac. (singing). St Cecil is my dear! Mar. (furiously). Blast! blast and scatter Thy body to ashes! Off! I'll have his ghost! [Rushes at Jacconot. They fight. Marlowe disarms him; but Jacconot wrests Marlowe's own sword from his hand, and stabs him. Marlowe falls. Mid. See! see! Mar. Who's down?âanswer me, friendsâIs't I?â Or in the maze of some delirious trance, Some realm unknown, or passion newly bornâ Ne'er felt beforeâam I transported thus? My fingers paddle too, in bloodâis't mine? Jac. Oh, content you, Master Marplotâit's you that's down, drunk or sober; and that's your own blood on your fingers, running from a three-inch groove in your ribs for the devil's imps to slide into you. Ugh! cry grammercy! for its all over with your rhyming! Hey. Oh, heartless mischief! Mid. Hence, thou rabid cur! Mar. What demon in the air with unseen arm Hath turn'd my unchain'd fury 'gainst myself! Recoiling dragon! thy resistless force Scatters thy mortal master in his pride, To teach him, with self-knowledge, to fear thee. Forgetful of all corporal conditions, My passion hath destroy'd me! Jac. No such matter; it was my doing. You shouldn't ha' ran at me in that fashion with a real swordâI thought it had been one o'your sham ones. Mid. Away! Hey. See! his face changesâlift him up. [They raise and support him. Hereâplace your hand upon his side, Close over mine, and stanch the flowing wound. Mar. Bright is the dayâthe air with glory teemsâ And eagles wanton in the smile of Jove: Can these things be, and Marlowe live no more! Oh, Heywood! Heywood! I had a world of hopes About that womanânow in my heart they rise Confused, as flames from my life's coloured map, That burns until with wrinkling agony Its ashes flatten, separate, and drift Thro' gusty Darkness. Hold me fast by the arm! A little aid will save me:âsee! she's here: I clasp thy formâI feel thy breath, my love; And know thee for a sweet saint come to save me! Save!âis it death I feelâit cannot be death? Jac. (half aside). Marry, but it can!âor else your sword's a foolish dog that dar'n't bite his owner. Mar. Oh, friendsâdear friendsâthis is a sorry endâ A most unworthy end! To thinkâoh, God! To think that I should fall by the hand of one Whose office, like his nature, is all baseness, Gives death ten thousand stings, and to the grave A damning victory! Fame sinks with life! A gallingâshamefulâignominious end! [Sinks down. Oh, mighty heart! Oh, full and orbed heart, Flee to thy kindred sun, rolling on high! Or let the hoary and eternal sea Sweep me away, and swallow body and soul! Jac. There'll be no âencoreâ to either, I wot; for thou'st led an ill life, Master Marlowe; and so the sweet saint thou spok'st of will remain my fair gameâbehind the scenes. Mar. Liar! slave! slaâKind Master Heywood, You will not see me die thus!âthus by the hand And maddening tongue of such a beast as that! Haste if you love meâfetch a leech to help meâ HereâMiddletonâsweet friendâa bandage hereâ I cannot die by such a handâI will notâ I say I will not die by that vile hand! Go bring Cecilia to meâbring the leechâ Closeâclose this woundâyou know I did it myselfâ Bring sweet Ceciliaâhasteâhasteâinstantlyâ Bring life and timeâbring HeavenâOh, I am dyingâ Some waterâstay beside meâmaddening death, By such a hand! Oh, villain! from the grave I constantly will riseâto curse! curse! curse thee! [Risesâand falls dead. Mid. Terrible end! Hey. Oh, God!âhe is quite gone! Jac. 'Twas dreadfulâ'twas. Christ help us! and lull him to sleep in's grave. I stand up for mine own nature none the less. What noise was that? Enter Officers. Chief Offi. This is our manâha! murder has been here! You are our prisonerâthe gallows waits you. Jac. What have I done to be hung up like a pear? The hemp's not sown, nor the ladder-wood grown, that shall help fools to finish me! He did it himself! He said so with his last words!âthere stand his friends and brother playersâput them to their Testament if he said not he did it himself? Ch. Offi. Who is it lies here?âmethinks that I should know him, But for the fierce distortion of his face! Mid. He who erewhile wrote with a brand of fire, Now, in his passionate blood, floats tow'rds the grave! The present time is ever ignorantâ We lack clear vision in our self-love's maze; But Marlowe in the future will stand great, Whom thisâthe lowest caitiff in the worldâ A nothing, save in grossness, hath destroy'd. Jac. âCaitiffâ back again in your throat! and âgross nothingâ to bootâmay you have it to live upon for a month, and die mad and starving! Would'st swear my life away so lightly! Tut! who was he? I could always find the soundings of a quart tankard, or empty a pasty in half his time, and swear as rare oaths between whilesâwho was he? I too ha' writ my odes and Pindar-jigs with the twinkling of a bed-post, to the sound of the harp and hurdy-gurdy, while Capricornus wagged his fiery beard; I ha' sung songs to the faint moon's echoes at day-break, and danced here away and there away, like the lightning though a forest! As to your sword and dagger-play, I've got the trick o'the eye and wristâwho was he? What's all his godsâhis goddesses and lies?âthe first a'nt worth a word; and for the latter, I was always a prince of both! Caitiff! and beast! and nothing!âwho was he? Ch. Offi. You're ours, for sundry villanies committed, Sufficient each to bring your vice to an end: The law hath got you safely in its grasp. Jac. Then may Vice and I sit crown'd in heavenâwhile Law and Honesty stalk damned through hell! Now do I see the thing very plain!âtreacheryâtreachery, my masters! I know the jade that hath betrayed meâI know her. 'Slud! who cares? She was a fine woman, tooâa rare personâand a good spirit; but there's an end of all nowâshe's turned foolish and virtuous, and a tell-tale, and I am to be turned to dust through itâlong, long before my time; and these princely limbs must go make a dirt-pieâbuild up a mud-hutâor fatten an alderman's garden! There! calf-headsâthere's a lemon for your mouths! Heard'st ever such a last dying speech and confession! Write it in red ocre on a sheet of Irish, and send it to Mistress Cecily for a death-winder. I know what you've got against meâand I know you all deserve just the same yourselvesâbut lead on, my masters! [Exeunt Jacconot and Officers. Mid. Oh, Marlowe! can'st thou rise with power no more? Can greatness die thus? Hey. Miserable sight! (A shriek outside the house.) Mid. That cry!âwhat may that mean? Hey. I hear no cry. Mid. What is't comes hither, like a gust of wind? Cecilia rushes in. Cec. Whereâwhere? Oh, then, 'tis trueâand he is dead! All's over nowâthere's nothing in the worldâ For he who raised my heart up from the dust, And show'd me noble lights in mine own soul, Has fled my gratitude and growing loveâ I never knew how deep it was till now! Through me, too!âdo not curse me!âI was the causeâ Yet do not curse meâNo! no! not the cause, But that it happen'd so. This the reward Of Marlowe's love!âwhy, why did I delay? Oh, gentlemen, pray for me! I have been Lifted in heavenly airâand suddenly The arm that placed me, and with strength sustain'd me, Is snatch'd up, star-ward: I can neither follow, Nor can I touch the gross earth any more! Pray for me, gentlemen!âbut breathe no blessingsâ Let not a blessing sweeten your dread prayersâ I wish no blessingsânor could bear their weight; For I am left I know not where or how: But, pray for meâmy soul is buried here. [Sinks down upon the body. Mid. âCut is the branch that might have grown full straight, âAnd burned is Apollo's laurel bough!â</field>
