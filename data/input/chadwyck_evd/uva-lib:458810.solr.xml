      <field name="fulltext">OBERON, THE FAERY PRINCE. A MASQVE of Prince Henries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first face of the Scene appeared all obscure, &amp; nothing perceiu'd but a darke Rocke, with trees beyond it; and all wildnesse, that could be presented: Till, at one corner of the cliffe, aboue the Horizon, the Moone began to shew, and rising, a Satyre was seene (by her light) to put forth his head, and call. Satyre. I. They are the names of two yong Satyres, I find in Vir. Eclog. 6. that took Silanus sleeping; who is fain'd to bee the Pædagoge of Bacchus: As the Satyres are his Collusores, or Play-fellowes. So doth Diodor. Siculus, Synesius, Julian. in Cæsarib. report them. Chromis, Mnasyl? None appeare? See you not, who riseth here? A prouerbiall speech, when they will taxe one the other of drinking, or sleepinesse; alluding to that former place, in Uirgil. Chromis &amp; Mnasylus in antro Silenum, pueri, somno videre iacentem, Inflatum hesterno venas, vt semper Iaccho.You saw Silenvs, late, I feare! I'le proue, if this can reach your eare. He wound his Cornet, and thought himselfe answer'd; but was deceiued by the Echo. O, you wake then: Come away, Times be short, are made for play; The hum'rous Moone too will not stay: What doth make you thus delay? Silenus is euery where made a louer of wine, as in Cyclope Eurip and known by that notable ensigne, his tankard: out of the same place of Virg. Et granis attritâ pendebat cantharus ansâ. As also out of that famous piece of sculpture, in a little gem or piece of Iasper, obseru'd by Monsieur Causabon, in his tract de Saty.ricâ poësi, from Rascasius Bagarrius; wherein is described the whole manner of the Scene, and Ohori, of Bacchus, with Silenus, and the Satyres. An elegant an curious antiquitie, both for the subtiltie and labour: where, in so small a compasse, (to vse his words) there is Rerum, Personarum, Actionum plane stupenda varietas.Hath his tankard touch'd your braine? Sure, they'ar falne asleepe againe: Or I doubt it was the vaine Echo, did me entertaine. Proue, againe. I thought 'twas shee. He wound the second time, and found it. Idle Nymph, I pray thee, bee Modest, and not follow me: Respecting that knowne fable of Echo's following Narcissus; and his selfe-Loue.I nor loue my selfe, nor thee. Here he wound the third time, and was answer'd by another Satyre, who likewise shewed himselfe. To which he spoke. I, this sound I better know: List! I would I could heare mo. At this they came running forth seuerally, from diuers parts of the Rocke, leaping, and making antique action, and gestures, to the number of tenne; some of them speaking, some admiring. And amongst them a Silene, who is euer the Præfect of the Satyres, and so presented in all their Chori, and meetings. Satyre. 2. Thanke vs, and you shall doe so. Satyre. 3. I, our number soone will grow. Satyre. 2. See In the pomps of Dyonysius, or Bacchus, to euery Companie of Satyres, there was stil giuen a Silene, for their ouer-seer, or gouernour. And in that which is describ'd by Athenæus, in his fifth Booke, Bini Sileni non semel commemorantur, qui totidem plurtum Satyrorum gregibus præfint. Erant enim corum Epistatæ, Præsules, &amp; Coryphæi, propter grandem ætatem. He was also purpureo pallio vestitus, cum albis soleis, &amp; petasatus anreum caduceum paruum ferens. Vid. Athenæ, Deignos. lib. 5. de pompâ Ptolomæieâ. Silenvs! Satyre. 3. CERCOPS, too! Satyre 4. Yes. What is there now to doe? Satyre 5. Are there any Nymphes to woo? Satyre 4. The nature of the Satyres the wise Horace express'd wel, in the word, when hee called them Risores &amp; Dicaces, as the Greeke Poets, Nonnus, &amp;c. stile them ?????????????. Nec solùm dicaces, sed &amp; proni in venerem, &amp; saltatores assidui &amp; credebantur, &amp; fingebantur. Vnde Satyrica saltatio, quæ ???????? dicebatur, &amp; à quâ Satyri ipsi ???????????. Vel à Sicino inuentore; vel ??? ???????????, id est, à motu saltationis Satyror?, qui est concitatissimus.If there bee, let mee haue two. SILENVS. But in the Silenes, was nothing of this petulance, and lightnesse; but on the contrarie, all grauitie, and profound knowledge, of most secret mysteries. Insomuch as the most learned of Poets, Virgil, when he would write a Poeme of the beginnings, and hidden nature of things, with other great Antiquities, attributed the parts of disputing them, to Silenus, rather then any other. Which whosoeuer thinkes to bee easily, or by chance, done by the most prudent writer, will easily betray his owne ignorance, or folly. To this see the testimonies of Plato, Synesius, Herodotus, Strabo, Philostratus, Tertullian, &amp;c.Chaster language. These are nights Solemne, to the shining rites Of the Fayrie Prince, and Knights: While the Moone their Orgies lights. Satyre 2. Will they come abroad, anon? Satyre. 3. Shall wee see yong Oberon? Satyre 4. Is hee such a princely one, As you speake him long agone? SILENVS. Satyres, he doth fill with grace, Euery season, eu'ry place; Beautie dwels, but in his face: Among the ancients, the kind, both of the Centaures, and Satyres, is confounded; and common with eyther. As sometimes the Satyres are said to come of the Centaures, and againe the Centaures of them. Eyther of th? are ??????, but after a diuers manner. And Galen obserues out of Hippocrat. Comment. 3. in 6. Epidemior: that both the Athenians and Ionians, call'd the Satyres ?????, or ??????; which name the Centaures haue with Homer: from whence, it were no vnlikely coniecture, to thinke our word Faêries to come. Viderint Critici.H'is the height of all our race. Our Pan's father, Mercurie, who for the loue of Penelope, while she was keeping her father Icarius heards on the mountaine Taygetan, turn'd himselfe into a faire Buck-Goat; with whose sports and flatteries, the nymph being taken, he begat, on her, Pan: who was borne, capite cornuto, barbâque, ac pedibus hircints. As Homer hath it, in Hymnis: and Lucian, in dialogo Panis &amp; Mercurÿ. He was call'd the Giuer of Grace, ?????????, ???????, ??? ??????. Hilaris, &amp; albus, nitens Cyllenius alis. As Bacchus was call'd ??????, floridus: and Hebo, à lanugine &amp; molli ætate, semper virens. god of tongue, Bacchvs, though he still be yong, Phœbvs, Apollo is said, after Iupiter had put Saturne to flight, to haue sung his fathers victorie to the Harpe, Purpureâ togâ decorus, &amp; lauro coronatus, mirificeque does omnes qui accubuerant, in conviuio delectauisse. Which Tibullus, in lib. 2. Elegiar. points to. Sed nitidus, pulcer?, veni. Nunc indue vestem Purpuream, longas nunc bene necte comas. Qualem te memorant Saturno rege fugato Victoris laudes tunc cecinisse Iouis. when he crowned sung, Nor Mars, He was then louely, as being not yet stayn'd with bloud, and call'd ????????? ????, quasi aureum flagellum (vel rectius) auream galeam habens. when first his armor rung, Might with him be nam'd, that day. He is louelier, then in May Is the Spring, and there can stay As little, as he can decay. CHORVS. O, that he would come away! Satyre 3. In Iulius Pollux, lib. 4. cap. 19. in that part, which he entitles de Satyricis personis, we reade, that Silenus is called ??????, that is, auus, to note his great age: as amongst the comick persons, the reuerenced for their yeares, we called ??????: and with Iulian, in Cæs. Bacchus, when he speakes him faire, calls him ?????????. Grandsire, we shall leaue to play With A name of Bacchus, Lyæus, of freeing mens mindes from cares: ???? ?? ???, soluo. Lyævs now; and serue Only Ob'ron? SILENVS. Hee'le deserue All you can, and more, my boyes. Satyre 4. Will he giue vs prettie toyes, To beguile the girles withall? Satyre 3. And to make 'hem quickly fall? SILENVS. Peace my wantons: he will doe More, then you can ayme vnto. Satyre 4. Will he build vs larger caues? SILENVS. Yes, and giue you yuorie staues, When you hunt; and better wine: Satyre I. Then the master of the Vine? Satyre 2. And rich prizes, to be wunne, When we leape, or when we runne? Satyre I. I, and gild our clouen feet? Satyre 3. Strew our heads with poulders sweet? Satyre I. Bind our crooked legges in hoopes Made of shells, with siluer loopes? Satyre 2. Tie about our tawnie wrists Bracelets of the Fairie twists? Satyre 4. And, to spight the coy Nymphes scornes, Hang vpon our stubbed hornes, Garlands, ribbands, and fine poesies; Satyre 3. Fresh, as when the flower discloses? Satyre I. Yes, and stick our pricking eares With the pearle that Tethys weares. Satyre 2. And to answere all things els, Trap our shaggie thighs with bels; That as we do strike a time, In our daunce, shall make a chime Satyre 3. Lowder, then the rattling pipes Of the wood-gods; Satyre I. Or the stripes Erat solenne Baccho in pomo. tencrorum more purorum gestlaui à Sileno, &amp; Satyris, Bacchis præcedentibus, quarum vna semper erat Tympanistria, altera Tibicina, &amp;c. vide Athenæ.Of the Taber; when we carrie Bacchvs vp, his pompe to varie. CHORVS. O, that he so long doth tarrie! SILENVS. See, the rocke begins to ope, Now you shall enioy your hope; 'Tis about the houre, I know. There the whole Scene opened; and within was discouer'd the Frontispice of a bright and glorious Palace, whose gates and walls were transparent. Before the gates lay two Syluanes, armed with their clubs, and drest in leaues, asleepe. At this, the Satyres wondering, Silenvs proceedes. Looke! Do's not his Palace show Like another Skie of lights? Yonder, with him, liue the knights, Once, the noblest of the earth, Quick'ned by a second birth; Who, for prowesse, and for truth, There are crownd with lasting youth: And do hold, by Fates command, Seats of blisse in Fairie land. But their guards (me thinks) do sleep! Let vs wake 'hem. Sirs, you keepe Proper watch, that thus doe lye Drown'd in sloth. Satyre I. They'ha'ne're an eye To wake withall. Satyre 2. Nor sence, I feare; For they sleepe in either eare. Satyre 3. Holla, Syluanes! Sure, they'ar' caues Of sleepe, these; or els they'ar'graues! Satyre 4. Heare you, friends, who keepes the keepers? Satyre I. They'are the eight &amp; ninth sleepers? Satyre 2. Shall we crampe 'hem? SILENVS. Satyres, no. Satyre 3. Would we'had Boreas here, to blow Off their leauie coats, and strip 'hem. Satyre 4. I, I, I; that we might whip 'hem. Satyre 3. Or, that w' had a waspe, or two For their nostrills. Satyre I. Hayres will doe Euen as well: Take my tayle. Satyre 2. What do'you say t'a good nayle Through their temples? Satyre 3. Or an eele, In their guts, to make 'hem feele? Satyre 4. Shall wee steale away their beards? Satyre 3. For Pans goat, that leads the herds? Satyre 2. Or trie, whether is more dead, His club, or the'others head. SILENVS. Wags, no more: you grow too bold. Satyre I. I would faine, now, see 'hem rol'd Downe a hill, or from a bridge Headlong cast, to break their ridge- Bones: or to some riuer take 'hem; Plump: and see, if that would wake 'hem. Satyre 2. There no motion, yet, appeares. SILENVS. Strike a charme into their cares. At which the Satyres fell sodainely into this catch. Buz, quoth the blue Flie, Hum, quoth the Bee: Buz, and hum, they crie, And so doe wee. In his eare, in his nose, Thus, doe you see? He eat the dormouse, Else it was hee. The two Syluanes starting vp amazed, and betaking themselues to their armes, were thus question'd by Silenvs. How now, Syluanes! can you wake? I commend the care you take I'your watch. Is this your guise. To haue both your eares, and eyes Seal'd so fast; as these mine Elues Might haue stolne you, from your selues? Satyre 3. We had thought we must haue got Stakes, and heated 'hem red-hot, And haue bor'd you, thrugh the eies (With the Vid. Cyc. Euripid. vbi Satyri Vlyssi auxilio sint ad amburendum oculum Cyclopis. Cyclops) e're you'ld rise. Satyre 2. Or haue fetch'd some trees, to heaue Vp your bulkes, that so did cleaue To the ground, there. Satyre 4. Are you free Yet of sleepe, and can you see Who is yonder vp, aloofe? Satyre I. Be your eyes, yet, Moone-proofe? SYLVANE. Satyres, leaue your petulance; And goe friske about, and dance; Or else raile vpon the moone: Your expectance is too soone. For before the second cock Crow, the gates will not vnlock. And, till then, we know we keepe Guard enough, although we sleepe. Satyre I. Say you so? then let vs fall To a song, or to a brawle: Shall we, grand-sire? Let vs sport, And make expectation short. SILENVS. Doe my wantons, what you please. Ile lie downe, and take mine ease. Satyre I. Brothers, sing then, and vpbraid (As we vse) yond' seeming maid. Song. Now, my cunning lady; Moone, C? you leaue the side, so soone, Of the boy, you keepe so hid? Mid-wife Ivno sure will say, This is not the proper way Of your palenesse to be rid. But, perhaps, it is your grace To weare sicknesse i' your face, That there might be wagers laid, Still, by fooles, you are a maid. Come, your changes ouerthrow, What your looke would carry so; Moone, c?fesse then, what you are. And be wise, and free to vse Pleasures, that you now doe loose; Let vs Satyres haue a share. Though our forms be rough, &amp; rude Yet our acts may be endew'd With more vertue: Euery one Cannot be Endymion. The song ended: They fell sodainely into an antique dance, full of gesture, and swift motion, and continued it, till the crowing of the cock: At which they were interrupted by Silenvs. SILENVS. Stay, the cheerefull Chanticleere. Tells you, that the time is neere: See, the gates alreadie spread! Euery Satyre bow his head. There the whole palace open'd, and the nation of Faies were discouer'd, some with instruments, some bearing lights; others singing; and within a farre off in perspectiue, the knights masquers sitting in their seuerall sieges: At the further end of all Oberon, in a chariot, which to a lowd triumphant musique began to moue forward, drawne by two white beares, and on either side guarded by three Syluanes, with one going in front. Song. [FAIES.] Melt earth to sea, sea flow to ayre, And ayre flie into fire, Whilst we, in tunes, to Arthvrs chayre Beare Oberons desire; Then which there nothing can be higher, Saue IAMES, to whom it flyes: But he the wonder is of tongues, of eares, of eyes. Who hath not heard, who hath not seene, Who hath not sung his name? The soule, that hath not, hath not beene; But is the very same With buryed sloth, and knowes not fame, Which doth him best comprise: For he the wonder is of tongues, of eares, of eyes. By this time, the chariot was come as far forth as the face of the scene. And the Satyres beginning to leape, and expresse their ioy, for the vn-vsed state, and solemnitie, the formost Syluane began to speake. SYLVANE. Giue place, and silence; you were rude too late: This is a night of greatnesse, and of state; Not to be mixt with light, and skipping sport: A night of homage to the British court, And ceremony, due to Arthvrs chaire, From our bright master, Oberon the faire: Who, with these knights, attendants, here preseru'd In Faery land, for good they haue deseru'd Of yond' high throne, are come of right to pay Their annuall vowes; and all their glories lay At feet, and tender to this only great, True maiestie, restored in this seate: To whose sole power, and magick they doe giue The honor of their being; that they liue Sustayn'd in forme, fame, and felicitie, From rage of fortune, or the feare to die. SILENVS. And may they well. For this indeed is hee, My boyes, whom you must quake at, when you see. He is aboue your reach; and neither doth, Nor can he thinke, within a Satyres tooth: Before his presence, you must fall, or flie. He is the matter of vertue, and plac'd high. His meditations, to his height, are euen: And all their issue is a kin to heauen. He is a god, o're kings; yet stoupes he then Neerest a man, when he doth gouerne men; To teach them by the sweetnesse of his sway, And not by force. H'is such a king, as thay, Who'are tyrannes subiects, or ne're tasted peace, Would, in their wishes, forme, for their release. 'Tis he, that stayes the time from turning old, And keepes the age vp in a head of gold. That in his owne true circle, still doth runne; And holds his course, as certayne as the sunne. He makes it euer day, and euer spring, Where he doth shine, and quickens euery thing Like a new nature: so, that true to call Him, by his title, is to say, Hee's all. SYLVANE. I thanke, the wise Silenvs, for this prayse. Stand forth, bright Faies, and Elues, and tune your layes Vnto his name: Then let your nimble feet Tread subtle circles, that may alwayes meet In point to him; and figures, to expresse The grace of him, and his great empresse. That All, that shall to night behold the rites, Perform'd by princely Oberon, and these knights, May, without stop, point out the proper hayre Design'd so long to Arthvrs crownes, and chayre. The Song, by two Faies. 1., 2. Seeke you maiestie, to strike? Bid the world produce his like. Seeke you glorie, to amaze? Here, let all eyes stand at gaze. 1. Seeke you wisedome, to inspire? 2. Touch, then, at no others fire. 1. Seeke you knowledge, to direct? Trust to his, without suspect. 2. Seeke you pietie, to lead? In his foot-steps, only, tread. Cho. Euery vertue of a king, And of all, in him, we sing. Then, the lesser Faies dance forth their dance; which ended, A full song followes, by all the voyces. Song. The solemne rites are well begunne; And, though but lighted by the moone, They shew as rich, as if the sunne Had made this night his noone. But may none wonder, that they are so bright, The moone now borrowes from a greater light: Then, princely Oberon, Goe on, This is not euery night. There Oberon, and the knights dance out the first masque-dance: which was follow'd with this song. Song. Nay, nay, You must not stay, Nor be weary, yet; This 's no time to cast away; Or, for Faies so to forget The vertue of their feet. Knottie legs, and plants of clay Seeke for ease, or loue delay. But with you it still should fare As, with the ayre of which you are. After which, they danced forth their second masque-dance, and were againe excited by a song. Song. 1. Nor yet, nor yet, O you in this night blest, Must you haue will, or hope to rest. 2. If you vse the smallest stay, You'll be ouertane by day. 1. And these beauties will suspect That their formes you doe neglect, If you doe not call them forth: 2. Or that you haue no more worth Then the course, and countrey Faery, That doth haunt the harth, or dairy. Then follow'd the measures, coranto's, galliards, &amp;c. till Phosphorvs, the day-starre appear'd, and call'd them away; but first they were inuited home, by one of the Syluanes, with his song. [SYLUANE.] Song. Gentle knights, Know some measure of your nights. Tell the high-grac'd Oberon, It is time, that we were gone. Here be formes, so bright, and acry, And their motions so they vary As they will enchant the Faery, If you longer, here, should tarry. PHOSPHORVS. To rest, to rest; The Herald of the day, Bright Phosphorvs commands you hence; Obay. The Moone is pale, and spent; and winged night Makes head-long haste, to flie the mornings sight: Who, now, is rising from her blushing warres, And, with her rosie hand, puts backe the starres. Of which my selfe, the last, her harbinger, But stay, to warne you, that you not defer Your parting longer. Then, doe I giue way, As night hath done, and so must you, to day. After this, they danc'd their last dance, into the worke. And with a full song, the starre vanish'd, and the whole machine clos'd. Song. O yet, how early, and before her time, The enuious Morning vp doth clime, Though shee not loue her bed! What haste the iealous Sunne doth make, His fiery horses vp to take, And once more shew his head! Lest, taken with the brightnesse of this night, The world should wish it last, and neuer misse his light.</field>
