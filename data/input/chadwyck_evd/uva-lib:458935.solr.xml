      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus ScÃ¦na prima. Enter King Frederick, Sorano, Valerio, Camillo, Cleanthes, Menallo, and Attendants. Sor. Will your Grace speak? Fre. Let me alone Sorano, Although my thoughts seeme sad, they are welcome to me. Sor. You know I am private as your secret wishes, Ready to fling my soule upon your service, Ere your command be on't. Fre. Bid those depart. Sor. You must retire my Lords. Cam. What new design is hammering in his head now? Cle. Lets pray heartily None of our heads meet with it, my wife's old, That's all my comfort. Men. Mine's ugly, that I am sure on, And I think honest too, 'twould make me start else. Cam. Mine's troubled in the Country with a feaver, And some few infirmities else; he looks againe, Come let's retire, certaine 'tis some she businesse, This new Lord is imployed. Val. I'le not be far off, because I doubt the cause. Ex. Lords. Fre. Are they all gone? Sor. All but your faithfull servant. Fred. I would tell thee, But 'tis a thing thou canst not like. Sor. Pray ye speak it, is it my head? I have it ready for ye, Sir: Is't any action in my powre? my wit? I care not of what nature, nor what followes. Fre. I am in love. Sor. That's the least thing of a thousand, The easiest to atchieve. Fre. But with whom Sorano? Sor. With whom you please, you must not be deny'd, Sir. Fred. Say it be with one of thy Kinswomen. Sor. Say withall, I shall more love your Grace, I shall more honour ye, And would I had enough to serve your pleasure. Fred. Why 'tis thy Sister then, the faire Evanthe, Ile be plaine with thee. Sor. Ile be as plaine with you Sir, She brought not her perfections to the world, To lock them in a case, or hang 'em by her, The use is all she breeds 'em for, she is yours, Sir. Fred. Dost thou meane seriously? Sor. I meane my Sister, And if I had a dozen more, they were all yours: Some Aunts I have, they have been handsome women, My mother's dead indeed, and some few cozens That are now shooting up, we shall see shortly. Fred. No, 'tis Evanthe. Sor. I have sent my man unto her, Upon some businesse to come presently Hither, she shall come; Your Grace dare speak unto her? Large golden promises, and sweet language, Sir, You know what they worke, she is a compleat Courtier, Besides Ile set in. Fred. She waights upon my Queene, What jealousie and anger may arise, Incensing her? Sora. You have a good sweet Lady, A woman of so even and still a temper, She knows not anger; say she were a fury, I had thought you had been absolute the great King, The fountaine of all honours, playes and pleasures, Your will and your commands unbounded also, Go get a paire of beads and learne to pray, Sir. Enter Servant. Ser. My Lord, your servant staies. Sor. Bid him come hither, and bring the Lady with him. Fred. I will wooe her, And either lose my selfe, or win her favour. Sor. She is comming in. Fre. Thy eyes shoot through the doore, They are so piercing, that the beames they dart Give new light to the roome. Enter Podramo and Evanthe. Eva. Whether dost thou go? This is the Kings side, and his private lodgings, What businesse have I here? Pod. My Lord sent for ye. Eva. His lodgings are below, you are mistaken, We left them at the staire-foot. Pod. Good sweet Madam, Evan. I am no Counsellor, nor important Sutor. Nor have no private businesse through these Chambers, To seek him this way, o' my life thou art drunke, Or worse then drunke, hir'd to convey me hither To some base end; now I looke on thee better, Thou hast a bawdy face, and I abhor thee, A beastly bawdy face, Ile go no further. Sor. Nay shrink not back, indeed you shall good Sister, Why do you blush? the good King will not hurt ye, He honours ye, and loves ye. Eva. Is this the businesse? Sor. Yes, and the best you ever will arive at, if you be wise. Eva. My Father was no bawd Sir, Nor of that worshipfull stock as I remember. Sor. You are a foole. Eva. You are that I shame to tell ye. Fred. Gentle Evanthe. Eva. The gracious Queen Sir Is well and merry, heaven be thanked for it, And as I think she waites you in the Garden. Fred. Let her wait there, I talk not of her Garden, I talk of thee sweet flower. Eva. Your Grace is pleasant, To mistake a nettle for a rose. Fred. No Rose, nor Lilly, nor no glorious Hyacinth Are of that sweetnesse, whitenesse, tendernesse, Softnesse, and satisfying blessednesse As my Evanthe. Eva. Your Grace speakes very feelingly, I would not be a hansome wench in your way Sir, For a new gowne. Fred. Thou art all hansomnesse, Nature will be asham'd to frame another Now thou art made, thou hast rob'd her of her cunning, Each severall part about thee is a beauty. Sor. Do you heare this Sister? Eva. Yes unworthy Brother, but all this will not do. Fred. But love Evanthe, Thou shalt have more then words, wealth, ease, and honors My tender wench. Eva. Be tender of my credit, And I shall love you Sir, and I shall honour ye. Fred. I love thee to injoy thee my Evanthe, To give thee the content of love. Eva. Hold, hold Sir, ye are to fleet, I have some businesse this way, your Grace can nere content. Sor. You stubborne toy. Eva. Good my Lord Bawd I thank ye. Fred. Thou shalt not go, beleeve me sweet Evanthe, So high I will advance thee for this favour, So rich and potent I will raise thy fortune, And thy friends mighty. Eva. Good your Grace be patient, I shall make the worst honourable wench that ever was, Shame your discretion, and your choyce. Fred. Thou shalt not. Eva. Shall I be rich do you say, and glorious, And shine above the rest, and scorne all beauties, And mighty in command? Fred. Thou shalt be any thing. Eva. Let me be honest too, and then ile thank ye. Have you not such a title to bestow too? If I prove otherwise, I would know but this Sir; Can all the power you have or all the riches, But tye mens tongues up from discoursing of me, Their eyes from gazing at my glorious folly, Time that shall come from wondering at my impudence, And they that read my wanton life from curses? Can you do this? have ye this magick in ye? This is not in your powre, though you be a Prince Sir, No more then evill is in holy Angels, Nor I, I hope; get wantonnesse confirm'd By Act of Parliament an honesty, And so receiv'd by all, ile hearken to ye. Heaven guide your Grace. Fred. Evanthe, stay a little, Ile no more wantonnesse, ile marry thee. Eva. What shall the Queene do? Fred. Ile be divorsed from her. Eva. Can you tell why? what has she done against ye? Has she contrived a treason gainst your Person? Abus'd your bed? does disobedience urge ye? Fre. That's all one, 'tis my will. Eva. 'Tis a most wicked one, A most absurd one, and will show a Monster; I had rather be a Whore, and with lesse sin, To your present lust, then Queen to your unjustice. Yours is no love, Faith and Religion fly it, Nor has no taste of faire affection in it, Some hellish flame abuses your faire body, And hellish furies blow it; looke behinde ye, Divorse ye from a woman of her beauty, Of her integrity, her piety? Her love to you, to all that honours ye, Her chast and vertuous love, are these fit causes? What will you do to me, when I have cloyd ye? You may finde time out in eternity, Deceit and violence in heavenly Justice, Life in the grave, and death among the blessed, Ere staine or brack in her sweet reputation. Sor. You have fool'd enough, be wise now, and a woman, You have shew'd a modesty sufficient, If not too much for Court. Eva. You have shew'd an impudence, A more experienc'd bawd would blush and shake at; You will make my kindred mighty. Fred. Prethee heare me. Evan. I do Sir, and I count it a great offer. Fre. Any of thine. Eva. 'Tis like enough you may clap honour on them, But how 'twill sit, and how men will adore it, Is still the question. Ile tell you what they'l say Sir, What the report will be, and 'twill be true too, And it must needs be comfort to your Master, These are the issues of her impudence: Ile tell your Grace, so deare I hold the Queene, So deare that honour that she nurs'd me up in, I would first take to me, for my lust, a Moore, One of your Gally-slaves, that cold and hunger, Decrepid misery, had made a mock-man, Then be your Queene. Fred. You are bravely resolute. Evan. I had rather be a Leopar, and be shun'd, And dye by peeces, rot into my grave, Leaving no memory behind to know me, Then be a high Whore to eternity. Fred. You have another Gamster I perceive by ye, You durst not slight me else. Sor. Ile finde him out, Though he lye next thy heart hid, Ile discover him, And ye proud peat, Ile make you curse your insolence. Val. Tongue of an Angell, and the truth of Heaven, How am I blest? Exit Val. Sor. Podramo go in hast To my Sisters Gentlewoman, you know her well, And bid her send her Mistris presently The lesser Cabinet she keeps her Letters in, And such like toyes, and bring it to me Instantly. Away. Pod. I am gone. Exit. Enter the Queene with two Ladies. Sora. The Queene. Fre. Lets quit the place, she may grow jealous. Exit. Fred. Soran. Mar. So suddenly departed, what's the reason? Doe's my approach displease his Grace? are my eyes So hatefull to him? or my conversation Infected, that he flies me? faire Evanthe, Are you there? then I see his shame. Eva. 'Tis true Madam, 'Thas pleas'd his Goodnesse to be pleasant with me, Mar. 'Tis strange to finde thy modesty in this place, Doe's the King offer faire? doe's thy face take him? Nere blush Evanthe, 'tis a very sweet one, Doe's he raine gold, and precious promises Into thy lap? will he advance thy fortunes? Shalt thou be mighty wench? Evan. Never mock Madam; 'Tis rather on your part to be lamented, At least reveng'd, I can be mighty Lady, And glorious too, glorious and great, as you are. Mar. He will marry thee. Evan. Who would not be a Queene, Madam? Mar. 'Tis true Evanthe, 'tis a brave ambition, A golden dreame, that may delude a good minde, What shall become of me? Evan. You must learne to pray, Your age and honour will become a Nunnery. Mar. Wilt thou remember me? Weeps. Evan. She weeps. Sweet Lady Upon my knees I aske your sacred pardon, For my rude boldnesse; and know, my sweet Mistris, If e're there were ambition in Evanthe, It was and is to do you faithfull duties; 'Tis true I have been tempted by the King, And with no few and potent charmes, to wrong ye, To violate the chaste joyes of your bed; And those not taking hold, to usurpe your state, But she that has been bred up under ye, And daily fed upon your vertuous precepts, Still growing strong by example of your goodnesse, Having no errant motion from obedience, Flyes from these vanities, as meere illusions; And arm'd with honesty, defies all promises. In token of this truth, I lay my life downe Under your sacred foot, to do you service. Mar. Rise my true friend, thou vertuous, bud of beauty, Thou Virgins honour, sweetly blow and flourish, And that rude nipping winde, that seeks to blast thee, Or taint thy root, be curst to all posterity; To my protection from this houre I take ye, Yes, and the King shall knowâ Evan. Give his heat way, Madam, And 'twill go out againe, he may forget all. Exeunt. Enter Camillo, Cleanthes, and Menallo. Cam. What have we to do with the times? we cannot cure 'em; Let 'em go on, when they are swolne with surfets They'le burst and stink, then all the world shall smell 'em Cle. A man may live a bawd, and be an honest man. Men. Yes, and a wise man too, 'tis a vertuous calling. Cam. To his owne wife especially, or to his sister, The neerer to his owne blood, still the honester; There want such honest men, would we had more of 'em. Men. To be a villaine is no such rude matter. Cam. No, if he be a neat one, and a perfect, Art makes all excellent, what is it Gentl. In a good cause to kill a dozen coxcombs? That blunt rude fellowes call good Patriots? Nothing, nor ne're look'd after. Men. 'Tis ene as much, as easie too, as honest, &amp; as cleer, To ravish Matrons, and deflowre coy wenches, But here they are so willing, 'tis a complement. Cle. To pull downe Churches with pretention, To build 'em fairer, may be done with honour, And all this time beleeve no God. Cam. I think so, 'tis faith enough if they name him in their angers, Or on their rotten Tombs ingrave an Angell; Well, brave Alphonso, how happy had we been, If thou had'st rain'd? Men. Would I had his disease, Tyed like a Leprosie to my posterity, So he were right againe. Cle. What is his Melady? Cam. Nothing but sad and silent melancholly, Laden with griefes and thoughts, no man knows why neither; The good brandino. Father to the Princesse, Used all the art and industry that might be, To free Alphonso from this dull calamity, And seat him in his rule, he was his eldest And noblest too, had not faire nature stopt in him, For which cause this was chosen to inherit, Frederick the yonger. Cle. Doe's he use his brother With that respect and honour that befits him? Cam. He is kept privately, as they pretend, To give more ease and comfort to his sicknesse; But he has honest servants, the grave Rugio, And Fryer Marco, that waight upon his Person, And in a Monastery he lives. Men. 'Tis full of sadnesse, To see him when he comes to his fathers Tombe, As once a day that is his Pilgrimage, Whilst in devotion the Quire sings an Antheme: How piously he kneeles, and like a Virgin That some crosse fate had cozen'd of her Love, Weeps till the stubborne Marble sweats with pitty, And to his grones the whole Quire beares a Chorus. Enter Frederick, Sorano with the Cabinet. Pod. So do I too. The King with his contrivers, This is no place for us. Exeunt Lords. Fred. This is a Jewell, Lay it aside, what Paper's that? Pod. A Letter, But 'tis a womans, Sir, I know by the hand, And the false authography, they write old Saxon. Fred. May be her ghostly mothers, that instructs her. Sor. No, 'tis a cozens, and came up with a great Cake. Fred. What's that? Sora. A paire of Gloves the Duchesse gave her, For so the outside saies. Fred. That other Paper? Sor. A charme for the tooth-ach, here's nothing but Saints and Crosses. Fre. Look in that box, me thinks that should hold secrets, Pod. 'Tis paint and curles of haire, she begins to exercise. A glasse of water too, I would faine taste it, But I am wickedly afraid 'twill silence me, Never a Conduit Pipe to convey this water. Sor. These are all Rings, deaths heads, and such momentoe. Her Grandmother, and worme-eaten Aunts left to her, To tell her what her beauty must arive at. Fred. That, that. Pod. They are written Songs Sir, to provoke young Ladies; Lord, here's a prayer booke, how these agree? Here's a strange Union. Sor. Ever by a sufeit you have a julip set to coole the Patient. Fred. Those, those. Sor. They are Verses to the blest Evanthe. Fred. Those may discover, Reade them out Sorano. To the blest Evanthe, Let those complaine, that feeles Loves cruelty, And in sad Legents write their woes, With Roses gently 'has corrected me; My war is without rage or blowes; My Mistris eyes shine faire on my desires, And hope springs up inflam'd with her new fires. No more an Exile will I dwell, With folded armes, and sighs all day, Reckoning the torments of my hell, And flinging my sweet joyes away; I am call'd home againe to quiet peace, My Mistris smiles, and all my sorrowes cease. Yet what is living in her eyes? Or being blest with her sweet tongue, If these no other joyes imply? A golden Give, a pleasing wrong: To be your owne but one poore Moneth, I'd give My youth, my fortune, and then leave to live. Fred. This is my rivall, that I knew the hand now. Sor. I know it, I have seene it, 'tis Valerio's, That hopefull Gentlemans that was brought up with ye, And by your charge nourisht and fed At the same Table, with the same allowance. Fred. And all this curtesie to ruine me? Crosse my desires? had better have fed humblier, And stood at greater distance from my fury: Go for him quickly, finde him instantly, Whilst my impatient heart swells high with choller; Better have lov'd despaire, and safer kist her. Exit Lords. Enter Evanthe and Cassandra. Eva. Thou old weak foole, dost thou know to what end, To what betraying end he got this Casket? Durst thou deliver him without my Ring? Or a command from mine own mouth? that Cabinet That holds my heart, you unconsiderate asse, Thou brainlesse Ideot. Cas. I saw you go with him, At their first word commit your person to him, And made no scruple; he is your brothers Gentleman, And for any thing I know, an honest man; And might not I upon the same security deliver him a box? Evan. A Bottle-head. Fred. You shall have cause to chafe, as I will handle it. Eva. I had rather thou hadst delivered me to Pirats, Betraid me to uncurable diseases, Hung up my Picture in a Market place, And sold me to wilde bawds. Cassan. As I take it Madam, Your Maidenhead lyes not in that Cabinet, You have a Closet, and you keep the key too, Why are you vext thus? Eva. I could curse thee wickedly, And wish thee more deformed then age can make thee, Perpetuall hunger, and no teeth to satisfie it, Waight on thee still, nor sleep be found to ease it: Those hands that gave the Casket, may the Palfie For ever make unusefull, even to feed thee; Long winters, that thy bones may turne to Isicles No Hell can thaw againe, inhabit by thee. Is thy care like thy body, all on crookednesse? How scurvily thou criest now? like a drunkard, Ile have as pure teares from a durty spout: Do, sweare thou didst this ignorantly, sweare it, Sweare and be damn'd, thou halfe witch. Cassan. These are fine words, well Madam, Madam. Evan. 'Tis not well thou mummy, 'Tis impudently, basely done, thou durtyâ Fred. Has your young sanctity done railing, Madam, Against your innocent Squire? do you see this Sonnet? This loving Script? do you know from whence it came too? Eva. I do, and dare a vouch it pure and honest. Fred. You have private Visitants, my noble Lady, That in sweet numbers court your goodly vertues, And to the height of adoration. Evan. Well Sir, There's neither Heresie nor Treason in it. Fred. A Prince may beg at the doore; whilst these feast with ye; A favour or a grace, from such as I am. Enter Valerio, and Podrano. Course, common things. You are welcome; pray come neer, Sir, Do you know this paper? Val. I am betray'd; I do Sir, 'Tis mine, my hand and heart, if I die for her, I am thy Martyr, Love, and time shall honour me. Cass. You sawcy Sir, that came in my Ladies name, For her guilt Cabinet, you cheating Sir too, You scurvy Usher, with as scurvy leggs, And a worse face, thou poore base hanging holder, How durst thou come to me with a lye in thy mouth? An impudent lye? Pod. Hollow, good Jill, you hobble. Cass. A stinking lye, more stinking then the teller, To play the pilfring knave, there have been rascals Brought up to fetch and carry like your Worship, That have been hang'd for lesse, whipt there are daily And if the Law will do me rightâ Pod. What then old Maggot? Cass. Thy mother was carted younger; Ile have thy hide, Thy mangy hide, embroder'd with a dog-whip, As it is now with potent Pox, and thicker. Fred. Peace, good antiquity, Ile have your bones else Ground into Gunpowder to shoot at Cats with; One word more, and Ile blanch thee like an Almond, There's no such cure for the she-falling-sicknesse, As the powder of a dried bawds skin, be silent, You are very prodigall of your service here, Sir, Of your life more it seemes. Val. I repent neither, Because Your Grace shall understand it comes From the best part of love, my pure affection, And kindled with chaste flame, I will not fly from it, If it be error to desire to marry, And marry her that sanctity would dote on, I have done amisse; if it be a Treason To graft my soule to vertue, and to grow there, To love the tree thar beares such happinesse; Conceive me, Sir, this fruit was ne're forbidden; Nay, to desire to taste too, I am Traytor; Had you but plants enough of this blest Tree, Sir, Set round about your Court to beautifie it, Deaths twice so many, to dismay the aproachers, The ground would scarce yeeld graves to noble Lovers. Fred. 'Tis well maintain'd, you wish and pray to fortune, Here in your Sonnet, and she has heard your prayers, So much you dote upon your owne undoing, But one Month to injoy her as your wife, Though at the expiring of that time you die for't. Val. I could wish many, many ages Sir, To grow as old as time in her imbraces, If heaven would grant it, and you smile upon it; But if my choice were two houres, and then perish, I would not pull my heart back. Fred. You have your wish, To morrow I will see you nobly married, Your Month take out in all content and pleasure; The first day of the following Month you dye for't; Kneele not, not all your prayers can divert me; Now marke your sentence, mark it scornfull Lady, If when Valerio's dead, within twelve houres, For that's your latest time, you finde not out Another husband on the same condition To marry you againe, you dye your self too. Evan. Now you are mercifull, I thank your Grace. Fre. If when you are married, you but seek to scape Out of the Kingdome, you, or she, or both, Or to infect mens minds with hot commotions, You dye both instantly; will you love me now Lady? My tale will now be heard, but now I scorne ye. Exe. Manent, Valerio, and Evanthe. Eva. Is our faire love, our honest, our intire, Come to this hazard? Val. 'Tis a noble one, and I am much in love with malice for it, Envy could not have studied me a way, Nor fortune pointed out a path to honour, Straighter and nobler, if she had her eyes: When I have once injoyed my sweet Evanthe, And blest my youth with her most deere Imbraces, I have done my journey here, my day is out, All that the world has else is foolery, Labour, and losse of time, what should I live for? Think but mans life a moneth, and we are happy. I would not have my joyes grow old for any thing; A paradise, as thou art my Evanthe, Is only made to wonder at a little, Enough for humane eyes, and then to wander from. Come do not weep, sweet, you dishonour me, Your teares and griefes but question my ability, Whether I dare dye: Do you love intirely? Eva. You know I do. Val. Then grudge not my felicity. Eva. Ile to the Queene. Val. Do any thing that's honest, But if you sue to him in death, I hate you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Camillo, Cleanthes, and Menallo Cam. Was there ever heard of such a marriage? Men. Marriage and hanging go by destiny, 'Tis the old proverb, now they come together. Cle. But a month married, then to lose his life for't? I would have a long month sure that payes the Souldiers, Ent Tony with Urinall. Cam. Or get all the Almanacks burnt, that were a rare trick, And have no month remembred. How now Tony? Whose water are you casting? Tony. A sick Gentlemans, Is very sick, much troubled with the stone, He should not live above a month by his Urine, About Saint Davids day it will go hard with him, He will then be troubled with a paine in his neck too. Men. A pestilent foole; when wilt thou marry Tony? Ton. When I mean to be hangd, &amp; 'tis the surer contract. Cle. What think you of this marriage of Valerios? Tony. They have given him a hot custard, and meane to burne his mouth with it; had I knowne he had been given to die honourably, I would have helpt him to a wench, a rare one, should have kill'd him in three weeks, and sav'd the sentence. Cam. There be them would have spared ten daies of that too. Ton. It may be so, you have women of all vertues; There be some Guns that I could bring him too, Some Morter-peeces that are plac'd i'th Suburbs, Would teare him into quartets in two houres; There be also of the race of the old Cockatrices, That would dispatch him with once looking on him. Men. What Month wouldst thou chuse Tony, if thou hadst the like fortune? Ton. I would chuse a mull'd Sack month, to comfort my belly, for sure my back would ake for't, and at the months end I would be most dismally drunk, &amp; scorn the gallows. Me. I would chuse March, for I would come in like a Lion. To. But you'ld go out like a Lamb, when you went to hanging. Ca. I would take April, take the sweet o'th year, And kisse my wench upon the tender flowrets, Tumble on every Greene, and as the birds sung, Embrace and melt away my soule in pleasure. Ton. You would go a Maying gayly to the gallowes. Clean. Prethee tell us some newes. Tony. Ile tell ye all I know, You may be honest and poore fooles, as I am, And blow your fingers ends. Cam. That's no newes foole. Ton. You may be knaves then, when you please, starke knaves, And build faire houses, but your heires shall have none of 'em. Men. These are undoubted. Ton. Truth is not worth the hearing, Ile tell you newes then, There was a drunken Saylor, That got a Marmaid with childe as she went a milking, And now she sues him in the bawdy Court for it, The infant Monster is brought up in fish-street. Cam. I, this is somthing. Ton. Ile tell you more, There was a fish taken, A monstrous fish, with a sword by his side, a long sword, A pike in's neck, and a gun in's nose, a huge gun, And letters of Mart in's mouth, from the Duke of Florence. Cle. This is a monstrous lye. Ton. I do confesse it; Do you think I would tell you truths, that dare not heare 'em? You are honest things, we Courtiers scorn to converse with. Exit. Cam. A plaguy foole, but lets consider Gentl. Why the Queen strives not to oppose this sentence, The Kingdomes honour suffers in this cruelty. Men. No doubt the Queen, though she be vertuous, Winks at the marriage, for by that only meanes The Kings flame lessens to the youthfull Lady, If not goes out, within this month, I doubt not, She hopes to rock a sleep his anger also; Shall we go see the preparation? 'Tis time, for strangers come to view the wonder. Cam. Come, lets away, send my friends happier weddings. Exe. Enter Queen and Evanthe. Que. You shall be merry, come, Ile have it so, Can there be any nature so unnoble? Oranger so unhumane to pursue this? Eva. I feare there is. Que. Your feares are poore and foolish, Though he be hasty, and his anger death, His will like torrents, not to be resisted, Yet Law and Justice go along to guide him; And what Law or what Justice can he finde To justifie his will? what Act or Statute, By Humane or Divine establishment, Left to direct us, that makes marriage death? Honest faire wedlock? 'twas given for increase, For preservation of mankinde I take it; He must be more then man then, that dare break it; Come dresse ye handsomly, you shall have my Jewels, And put a face on that contemnes base fortune, 'T will make him more insult to see you fearfull, Outlooke his anger. Eva. O my Valerio! Be witnesse my pure minde, 'tis thee I grieve for. Que. But shew it not, I would so crucifie him With an innocent neglect of what he can do, A brave strong pious scorne, that I would shake him; Put all the wanton Cupids in thine eyes, And all the graces on that nature gave thee, Make up thy beauty to that height of excellence, Ile help thee, and forgive thee, as if Venus Were now againe to catch the God of Warre, In his most rugged anger, when thou hast him (As 'tis impossible he should resist thee) And kneeling at thy conquering feet for mercy, Then shew thy vertue, then againe despise him And all his power, then with a looke of honour, Mingled with noble chastity, strike him dead. Eva. Good Madam dresse me, You arme me bravely. Que. Make him know his cruelty Begins with him first, he must suffer for it, And that thy sentence is so welcome to thee, And to thy noble Lord, You long to meet it. Stamp such a deep impression of thy beauty Into his soule, and of thy worthinesse, That when Valerio and Evanthe sleep In one rich earth, hung round about with blessings, He may run mad, and curse his act; be lusty, Ile teach thee how to die too, if thou fear'st it. Evan. I thank your Grace, you have prepar'd me strongly, And my weak minde. Que. Death is unwelcome never, Unlesse it be to tortur'd mindes and sick soules, That make their own Hells; 'tis such a benefit When it comes crown'd with honour, shews so sweet too, Though they paint it ugly, that's but to restraine us, For every living thing would love it else, Fly boldly to their peace, ere nature call'd 'em; The rest we have from labour, and from trouble, Is some incitement, every thing alike, The poore slave that lies private has his liberty, As amply as his Master, in that Tombe, The earth as light upon him, and the flowers That grow about him, smell as sweet, and flourish, But when we love with honour to our ends, When memory and vertues are our mourners, What pleasure's there? they are infinite Evanthe; Onely, my vertuous wench, we want our sences, That benefit we are barr'd, 'twould make us proud else, And lazy to look up to happier life, The blessings of the people would so swell us. Evan. Good Madam dresse me, you have drest my soul, The merriest Bride ile be for all this misery, The proudest to some eyes too. Que. 'T will do better, come shrink no more. Evan. I am too confident. Exeunt. Enter Frederick and Sorano. Sora. You are too remisse and wanton in your angers, You mold things hansomly, and then neglect 'em; A powerfull Prince should be constant to his power still, And hold up what he builds, then people feare him; When he lets loose his hand, it shewes a weaknesse, And men examine or contemne his greatnesse; A scorne of this high kinde should have cal'd up A revenge equall, not a pitty in you. Fred. She is thy sister. Sor. And she were my mother, Whilst I conceive she has you wrong'd, I hate her, And shake her neernesse off; I study, Sir, To satisfie your angers that are just, Before your pleasures. Fred. I have done that already, I feare has pull'd to many curses on me. Sora. Curses or envies, on Valerio's head, Would you take my counsell, Sir, they should all light, And with the weight, not only crack his scull, But his faire credit; the exquisite vexation I have devis'd, so please you give way in't, And let it worke, shall more afflict his soule, And trench upon that honour that he brags of, Then feare of death in all the frights he carries; If you sit downe here they will both abuse ye, Laugh at your poore relenting powre, and scorne ye; What satisfaction can their deaths bring to you, That are prepar'd and proud to dye, and willingly, And at their ends will thank you for that honour? How are you nearer the desire you aim at? Or if it be revenge your anger covets, How can their single deaths give you content, Sir? Petty revenges end in blood, sleight angers, A Princes rage should finde out new diseases, Death were a pleasure too, to pay proud fooles with. Fred. What should I do? Sor. Adde but your power unto me, Make me but strong by your protection, And you shall see what joy, and what delight, What infinite pleasure this poore mouth shall yeeld him, Ile make him wish he were dead on's marriage day, Or bedrid with old age, ile make him curse, And cry and curse, give me but power. Fred. You have it, Here take my Ring, I am content he pay for't. Sor. It shall be now revenge, as I will handle it, He shall live after this to beg his life too, Twenty to one by this thread, as ile weave it, Evanthe shall be yours. Fred. Take all authority, and be most happy. Sor. Good Sir, no more pitty. Exeunt. Enter Tony, three Citizens, and three Wives. 1. Wife. Good Master Tony, put me in. Ton. Where do you dwell? 1. Wife. Forsooth, at the sign of the great shoulder of Mutton, To. A hungry man would hunt your house out instantly, Keep the dogs from your doore; Is this Lettice Ruffe your husband? a fine sharp sallet to your signe. 2. Wife. Will you put me in too? 3. Wife. And me, good Master Tony. Tony. Put ye all in? you had best come twenty more; you Think 'tis easie, a trick of legerdomaine, to put ye all in, 'Twould pose a fellow that had twice my body, Though it were all made into chines and sillets. 2. W. Puts into'th wedding, Sir, we would fain see that. 1. W. And the brave Masque too. To. You two are pretty women, are you their husbands? 2. Citiz. Yes, for want of better. Ton. I think so too, you would not be so mad else To turne 'em loose to a company of young Courtiers, That swarme like Bees in May, when they see young wenches; You must not squeak. 3. W. No Sir, we are better tutor'd. Ton. Nor if a young Lord offer you the curtesieâ 2. W. We know what 'tis, Sir. Ton. Nor you must not grumble, If you be thrust up hard, we thrust most furiously. 1. W. We know the worst. Ton. Get you two in then quietly, And shift for your selves; we must have no old women, They are out of use, unlesse they have petitions, Besides they cough so loud they drown the Musick, You would go in too, but there is no place for ye, I am sorry for't, go and forget your wives, Or pray they may be able to suffer patiently. You may have Heires may prove wise Aldermen, Go, or ile call the Guard. 3 Citi. We will get in, wee'l venture broken pates else. Exit Citiz. and Women. Ton. 'Tis impossible, You are too securely arm'd; how they flock hether, And with what joy the women run by heapes To see this Marriage? they tickle to think of it, They hope for every moneth a husband too; Still how they run, and how the wittals follow 'em, The weake things that are worne between the leggs, That brushing, dressing, nor new naps can mende, How they post to see their owne confusion? This is a merry world. Enter Frederick. Fred. Looke to the doore sirra, Thou art a foole, and may'st do mischiefe lawfully. Ton. Give me your hand, you are my brother Foole, You may both make the Law, and mar it presently. Do you love a wench? Fred. Who does not foole? Ton. Not I, unlesse you will give me a longer lease to marry her. Fred. What are all these that come, what businesse have they? Ton. Some come to gape, those are my fellow fooles; Some to get home theit wives, those be their own fooles; Some to rejoyce with thee, those be the times fooles; And some I feare to curse thee, those are poore fooles. Enter Cassandra, an old Lady passing over. A set people calls them honest. Looke, looke King, look, A weather-beaten Lady new carin'd. Fred. An old one. Ton. The glasses of her eyes are new rub'd over, And the worme-eaten records in her face are daub'd up neatly; She layes her breasts out too, like to poch'd eggs That had the yelkes suckt out; they get new heads also, New teeth, new tongues, for the old are all worne-out, And as 'tis hoped, new tayles. Fred. For what? Ton. For old Courtiers, The young ones are too stirring for their travells. Fred. Go leave your knavery, and helpe to keepe the doore well, I will have no such presse. Ton. Lay thy hand a thy heart King. Fred. Ile have ye whipt. Ton. The Foole and thou are parted. Exit. Fred. Sorano work, and free me from this spell, 'Twixt love and scorne there's nothing felt but hell. Exit. Enter Valerio, Camillo, Cleanthes, Menallo, and Servants. Val. Tye on my Scarfe, you are so long about me, Good my Lords help, give me my other Cloke, That Hat and Feather, Lord what a Taylor's this, To make me up thus straight, one sigh would burst me, I have not roome to breath, come button, button, Button, apace. Cam. I am glad to see you merry Sir. Val. 'T would make you merry had you such a wife, And such an age to injoy her in. Men. An age Sir? Val. A moneth's an age to him that is contented, What should I seeke for more? give me my sword. Ha my good Lords, that every one of you now Had but a Lady of that youth and beauty To blesse yourselves this night with, would ye not? Pray ye speak uprightly. Cle. We confesse ye happy, And we could well wish such another Banquet, But on that price my Lordâ Val. 'Twere nothing else, No man can ever come to aime at Heaven, But by the knowledge of a Hell. These shooes are heavy, And if I should be call'd to dance they'l clog me, Get me some pumps; ile tell ye brave Camillo, And you deare friends, the King has honour'd me, Out of his gracious favour has much honour'd me, To limit me my time, for who would live long? Who would be old? 'tis such a wearinesse, Such a disease, that hangs like lead upon us As it increases, so vexations, Griefes of the minde, paines of the feeble body, Rhumes, coughs, catarrs, we are but our living coffines; Beside, the faire soules old too, it growes covetous, Which shewes all honour is departed from us, And we are earth againe. Cle. You make faire use Sir. Val. I would not live to learne to lye Cleanthes For all the world, old men are prone to that too; Thou that hast been a Souldier, Menallo A noble Souldier, and defied all danger, Adopted thy brave arme the heire to victory, Would'st thou live so long till thy strength forsooke thee? Till thou grew'st only a long tedious story Of what thou hadst been? till thy sword hang by, And lazie Spiders fill'd the hilt with cobwebs? Men: No sure, I would not. Val. 'Tis not fit ye should, To dye a young man is to be an Angell, Our great good parts, put wings to our soules: Wee'l have a rouse before we go to bed friends, Pray ye tell me, ist a hansome Maske we have? Cam. We understand so. Val. And the young gent. dance? Cle. They do Sir, and some dance well. Val. They must before the Ladies, Wee'l have a rouse before we go to bed friends, A lusty one, 'twill make my blood dance too. Musick Cam. Ten if you please. Val. And wee'l be wondrous merry, They stay sure, come, I heare the Musick forward, You shall have all Gloves presently. Exit. Men. We attend Sir, but first we must looke to'th Doores. Knocking within. The King has charged us. Exeunt. Enter two Servants. 1 Serv. What a noyse do you keepe there, call my fellowes A the Guard; you must cease now untill the King be Enter'd, he is gone to'th Temple now. 2 Serv. Looke to that back doore, and keep it fast, They swarme like Bees about it, Enter Camillo, Cleanthes, Menallo, Tony following, and Foole following. Cam. Keepe back those Citizens, and let their wives in, Their hansome wives. Ton. They have crowded me to Vergis, I sweat like a Butter-box. 1 Serv. Stand further off there. Men. Take the women aside, and talk with 'em in privat, Give 'em that they came for. Ton. The whole Court cannot do it; Besides, the next Maske if we use 'em so, They'l come by millious to expect our largesse; We have broke a hundred heads. Cle. Are they so tender? Ton. But 'twas behinde, before they have all murrions. Cam. Let in those Ladies, make 'em roome for shame there. Ton. They are no Ladies, there's one bald before 'em, A gent. bald, they are curtall'd queanes in hired clothes, They come out of Spaine I think, they are very sultry. Men. Keep 'em in breath for an Embassadour. Knocks within. Me thinks my nose shakes at their memories, What bounsing's that? Within. I am one of the Musick Sir. Within. I have sweet-meats for the banquet. Cam. Let 'em in. Ton. They lye my Lord, they come to seeke their wives, Two broken Citizens. Cam. Breake 'em more, they are but brusled yet. Bold Rascalls, offer to disturbe your wives. Clea. Lock the doores fast, the Musick, hark, the King comes. A Curtaine drawne. The King, Queene, Valerio, Evanthe, Ladies, Attendants, Camillo, Cleanthes, Sorano, Menallo. A Maske. Cupid descends, the Graces sitting by him, Cupid being bound the Graces unbinde him, he speakes. Cup. Unbinde me, my delight, this night is mine, Now let me looke upon what Stars here shine, Let me behold the beauties, then clap high My cullor'd wings, proud of my Deity; I am satisfied, binde me agen, and fast, My angry Bow will make too great a waste Of beauty else, now call my Maskers in, Call with a Song, and let the sports begin; Call all my servants the effects of love, And to a measure let them nobly move. Come you servants of proud love, Come away: Fairely, nobly, gently move, Too long, too long you make us stay; Fancy, Desire, Delight, Hope, Feare, Distrust and Jealousie, be you too here; Consuming Care, and raging Ire, And Poverty in poore attire, March fairely in, and last Despaire; Now full Musick strike the Aire. Enter the Maskers, Fancy, Desire, Delight, Hope, Feare, Distrust, Jealousie, Care, Ire, Despaire, they dance, after which Cupid speakes. Cup. Away, I have done, the day begins to light, Lovers, you know your fate, good night, good night. Cupid and the Graces ascend in the Chariot. King. Come to the Banquet, when that's ended Sir, Ile see you a bed, and so good night; be merry, You have a sweet bed-fellow. Val. I thanke your Grace, And ever shall be bound unto your noblenesse. King. I pray I may deserve your thankes, set forward. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter divers Monkes, Alphonso going to the Tombe, Rugio and Frier Marco discover the Tombe and a Chaire. Mar. The night growes on, lead softly to the Tombe, And sing not till I bid ye; let the Musick Play gently as he passes. Rug. O faire picture, That wert the living hope of all our honours; How are we banisht from the joy we dreamt of? Will he ne're speak more? Mar. 'Tis full three moneths Lord Rugio, Since any articulate sound came from his tongue, Set him downe gently. Sits in a Chaire. Rug. What should the reason be Sir? Mar. As 'tis in nature with those loving Husbands, That sympathize their wives paines, and their throwes When they are breeding, and 'tis usuall too, We have it by experience so in him Sir, In this most noble spirit that now suffers; For when his honour'd Father good Brandino Fell sick, he felt the griefes, and labour'd with them, His sits and his disease he still inherited, Grew the same thing, and had not nature check'd him, Strength, and ability, he had dyed that houre too. Rug. Embleme of noble love! Mar. That very minute His fathers breath forsooke him, that same instant, A rare example of his piety, And love paternall, the Organ of his tongue Was never heard to sound againe; so neare death He seekes to waite upon his worthy Father, But that we force his meat, he were one body. Rug. He points toth' Tombe. Mar. That is the place he honours, A house I feare he will not be long out of. He will toth' Tombe, good my Lord lend your hand; Now sing the Funerall Song, and let him kneele, For then he is pleas'd. A Song. Rug. Heaven lend thy powerfull hand, And ease this Prince. Mar. He will passe back againe. Exeunt. Enter Valerio. Val. They drink abundantly, I am hot with wine too, Lustily warme, ile steale now to my happinesse, 'Tis midnight, and the silent houre invites me, But she is up still, and attends the Queene; Thou dew of wine and sleep hang on their eye-lids, Steep their dull sences in the healths they drink, That I may quickly finde my lov'd Evanthe. The King is merry too, and dranke unto me, Signe of faire peace, O this nights blessednesse! If I had forty heads I would give all for it. Is not the end of our ambitions, Of all our humane studies, and our travells, Of our desires, the obtaining of our wishes? Certaine it is, and there man makes his Center. I have obtain'd Enanthe, I have married her, Can any fortune keep me from injoying her? Enter Sorano. I have my wish, what's left me to accuse now? I am friends with all the world, but thy base malice; Go glory in thy mischiefes thou proud man, And cry it to the world thou hast ruin'd vertue; How I contemne thee and thy petty malice, And with what scorne I looke downe on thy practice. Sor. You'l sing me a new Song anon Ualerio, And wish these hot wordsâ Val. I despise thee fellow, Thy threats, or flatteries, all I fling behinde me; I have my end, I have thy noble Sister, A name too worthy of thy blood; I have married her, And will injoy her too. Sor. 'Tis very likely. Val. And that short moneth I have to blesse me with her Ile make an age, ile reckon each embrace A yeare of pleasure, and each night a Jubilee, Every quick kisse a Spring; and when I meane To lose my selfe in all delightfulnesse, Twenty sweet Summers I will tye together In spight of thee, and thy malignant Master: I will dye old in love, though young in pleasure. Sor. But that I hate thee deadly, I could pitty thee, Thou art the poorest miserable thing This day on earth; ile tell thee why Valerio, All thou esteemest, and build'st upon for happinesse, For joy, for pleasure, for delight is past thee, And like a wanton dreame already vanisht. Val. Is my love false? Sor. No, she is constant to thee, Constant to all thy misery she shall be, And curse thee too. Val. Is my strong body weakn'd, Charm'd, or abus'd with subtle drink? speak villaine. Sor. Neither, I dare speake, thou art still as lusty As when thou lovsdst her first, as strong and hopefull, The month thou hast given thee is a month of misery, And where thou think'st each hower shall yeeld a pleasure Looke for a killing paine, for thou shalt finde it Before thou dyest, each minute shall prepare it, And ring so many knells to sad afflictions; The King has given thee a long moneth to dye in, And miserably dye. Val. Undo thy Riddle, I am prepar'd what ever fate shall follow. Sor. Dost thou see this Ring? Val. I know it too. Sor. Then marke me, By vertue of this Ring this I pronounce to thee, 'Tis the Kings will. Val. Let me know it suddenly. Sor. If thou dost offer to touch Evanthes body Beyond a kisse, though thou art married to her, And lawfully as thou think'st may'st injoy her, That minute she shall dye. Val. O Devillâ Sor. If thou discover this command unto her, Or to a friend that shall importune thee, And why thou abstainest, and from whose will, ye all perish, Upon the self-same forfeit are ye fitted Sir, Now if ye love her, ye may preserve her life still, If not, you know the worst, how falls your month out? Val. This tyranny could never be invented But in the schoole of Hell, earth is too innocent; Not to injoy her when she is my wife? When she is willing too? Sor. She is most willing, And will run mad to misse; but if you hit her, Be sure you bit her home, and kill her with it; There are such women that will dye with pleasure: The Axe will follow else, that will not faile To fetch her Maiden-head, and dispatch her quickly; Then shall the world know you are the cause of Murther, And as 'tis requisite your life shall pay for't. Val. Thou dost but jest, thou canst not be so moostrous As thou proclaim'st thy selfe; thou art her Brother, and there must be a feeling heart within thee Of her afflictions; wert thou a stranger to us, And bred amongst wilde rocks, thy nature wilde too, Affection in thee as thy breeding, cold, And unrelenting as the rocks that nourisht thee, Yet thou must shake to tell me this; they tremble When the rude sea threatens divorce amongst 'em, They that are sencelesse things shake at a tempest; Thou art a manâ Sor. Be thou too then, 'twill try thee, And patience now will best become thy noblenesse. Val. Invent some other torment to afflict me, All, if thou please, put all afflictions on me, Study thy braines out for 'em, so this be none I care not of what nature, nor what cruelty, Nor of what length. Sor. This is enough to vex ye. Val. The tale of Tantalus is now prov'd true, And from me shall be registred Authentick; To have my joyes within my armes, and lawfull, Mine owne delights, yet dare not touch. Even as thou hatest me Brother, let no young man know this, As thou shalt hope for peace when thou most needest it, Peace in thy soule, desire the King to kill me, Make me a traitor, any thing, ile yeeld to it, And give thee cause so I may dye immediatly; Lock me in Prison where no Sun may see me, In walls so thick no hope may ere come at me; Keep me from meat, and drink, and sleep, ile blesse thee; Give me some damned potion to deliver me, That I may never know my selfe againe, forget My Country kindred, name and fortune; last, That my chaste love may never appeare before me, This were some comfort. Sor. All I have I have brought ye, And much may it do ye with it my deare Brother, See ye observe it well; you will finde about ye Many eyes set, that shall o're-looke your actions, If you transgresse ye know, and so I leave ye, Val. Heaven be not angry, and I have some hope yet, And when you please, and how allay my miseries. Enter Frederick. To whom I kneele be mercifull unto me, Looke on my harmelesse youth Angels of pitty, And from my bleeding heart wipe off my sorrowes, The power, the pride, the malice and injustice Of cruell men are bent against mine innocence. You that controwle the mighty wills of Princes, And bow their stubborne arms, look on my weaknesse, And when you please, and how, allay my miseries. Exit. Fred. Hast thou been with him? Sor. Yes, and given him that Sir Will make him curse his Birth; I told ye which way, Did you but see him Sir, but look upon him, With what a troubled and dejected nature He walkes now in a mist, with what a silence, As if he were the shrowd he wrapt himselfe in, And no more of Valerio but his shadow, He seekes obscurity to hide his thoughts in, You would wonder and admire for all you know it, His jollity is downe, valed to the ground Sir, And his high hopes of full delights and pleasures Are turn'd tormenters to him, strong diseases. Fred. But is there hope of her? Sor. It must fall necessary She must dislike him, quarrell with his person, For women once deluded are next Devills, And in the height of that opinion Sir, You shall put on againe, and she must meet ye, Fred. I am glad of this. Sor. Ile tell ye all the circumstance Within this houre, but sure I heard your Grace To day as I attended, make some stops, Some broken speeches, and some sighs between, And then your Brothers name I heard distinctly, And some sad wishes after. Fred. Ye are i'th right Sir, I would he were as sad as I could wish him, Sad as the earth. Sor. Would ye have it so? Fred. Thou hearest me, Though he be sick with small hope of recovery, That hope still lives, and mens eyes live upon it, And in their eyes their wishes; my Sorano, Were he but cold once in the tombe he dotes on, As 'tis the fittest place for melancholly, My Court should be another Paradice, And flow with all delights. Sor. Go to your pleasures, let me alone with this, Hope shall not trouble ye, nor he three dayes. Fred. I shall be bound unto thee. Enter Valerio, Camillo, Cleanthas, Menallo. Sor. Ile do it neatly too, no doubt shall catch me. Fred. Be gone, they are going to bed, ile bid good night to 'em. Sor. And mark the man, you'le scarce know 'tis Valerio. Exit. Cam. Cheere up my noble Lord, the minutes come; You shall injoy the abstract of all sweetnesse, We did you wrong you need no wine to warme ye, Desire shoots through your eyes like sudden wild-fires. Val. Beshrew me Lords, the wine has made me dull, I am I know not what. Fred. Good pleasure to ye, Good night and long too, as you finde your appetite You may fall too. Val. I do beseech your Grace, For which of all my loves and services Have I deserved this: Fred. I am not bound to answer ye. Val. Nor I bound to obey in unjust actions. Fred. Do as you please, you know the penalty, And as I have a soule it shall be executed; Nay look not pale, I am not used to feare Sir, If you respect your Lady, good night to ye Exit. Val. But for respect to her and to my duty, That reverent duty that I owe my Soveraigne, Which anger has no power to snatch me from, The good night should be thine; good night for ever, The King is wanton Lords, he would needs know of me How many nick chases I would make to night. Men. My Lord, no doubt you'l prove a perfect gamester. Val. Faith no, I am unacquainted with the pleasure, Bungle a set I may, how my heart trembles, And beats my breast as it would breake his way out Good night my noble friends. Cle. Nay we must see you toward your bed my Lord: Val. Good faith it needs not, 'Tis late, and I shall trouble you. Cam. No, no, till the Bride come Sir. Val. I beseech you leave me, You will make me bashfull else, I am so foolish, Besides, I have some few devotions Lords, And he that can pray with such a book in's armesâ Cam. Wee'l leave ye then, and a sweet night wait upon ye. Men. And a sweet issue of this sweet night crown ye. Cle. All nights and dayes be such till you grow old Sir. Exeunt Lords. Val. I thanke ye, 'tis a curse sufficient for me, A labour'd one too, though you meane a blessing. What shall I do, I am like a wretched Debtor, That has a summe to tender on the forfeit Of all he is worth, yet dare not offer it. Other men see the Sun, yet I must wink at it; And though I know 'tis perfect day, deny it: My veines are all on fire, and burne like Ãtna, Youth and desire beat larums to my blood, And adde fresh fuell to my warme affections. I must injoy her, yet when I consider, When I collect my selfe, and weigh her danger, The Tyrants will, and his powre taught to murther, My tender care controlls my blood within me, And like a cold fit of a peevish Ague Creepes to my soule, and flings an Ice upon me. Enter Queene, Evanthe, Ladies, and Foole. That locks all powres of youth up but prevention; O what a blessednesse 'twere to be old now, To be unable, bed-rid with diseases, Or halt on Crutches to meet holy Hymen; What a rare benefit, but I am curst That that speakes other men most freely happy, And makes all eyes hang on their expectations, Must prove the bane of me youth, and ability. She comes to bed, how shall I entertaine her? Ton. Nay I come after too, take the foole with ye, For lightly he is ever one at Weddings. Quee. Evanthe, make ye unready, your Lord staies for ye, And prethee be merry. Ton. Be very merry, Chicken, Thy Lord will pipe to thee anon, and make thee dance too. Lady. Will he so, good-man asse. Ton. Yes goody silly, And you had such a Pipe, that piped so sweetly, You would dance to death, you have learnt your singue a pace. Evan. Your Grace desires that that is too free in me, I am merry at the heart. Ton. Thou wilt be anon, the young smug Boy will give thee a sweet cordiall. Evan. I am so taken up in all my thoughts, So possest Madam with the lawfull sweets I shall this night partake of with my Lord, So far transported (pardon my immmodesty) Val. Alas poore wench, how shall I recompence thee? Evan. That though they must be short, and snatcht away too, E're they grow ripe, yet I shall far prefer 'em Before a tedious pleasure with repentance. Val. O how my heart takes. Evan. Take off my Jewells Ladies, And let my Ruffe loose, I shall bid good night to ye, My Lord staies here. Quee. My wench, I thank thee heartily, For learning how to use thy few houres hansomly, They will be yeares I hope; off with your Gowne now, Lay downe the bed there? Ton. Shall I get into it and warme it for thee, a Fooles fire is a fine thing, And I'll so busse thee. Quee. Ile have ye whipt ye rascall. Ton. That will provoke me more, ile talke with thy husband, He's a wise man I hope. Evan. Good night deare Madam, Ladies, no further service, I am well, I do beseech your Grace to give us this leave, My Lord and I to one another freely, And privately, may do all other Ceremonies, Women and Page wee'l be to one another, And trouble you no farther. Ton. Art thou a wife man? Val. I cannot tell thee Tony, aske my neighbours. Ton. If thou beest so, go lye with me to night, The old foole will lye quieter then the young one, And give thee more sleep, thou wilt looke to morrow else Worse then the prodigall foole the Ballad speakes of, That was sqeez'd through a horne. Val. I shall take thy counsell. Quee. Why then good night, good night my best Evanthe, My worthy maid, and as that name shall vanish, A worthy wife, a long and happy; follow sirra. Evan. That shall be my care, Goodnesse rest with your Grace. Quee. Be lusty Lord, and take your Lady to ye, And that power that shall part ye be unhappy. Val. Sweet rest unto ye, to ye all sweet Ladies; Tony good night. Ton. Shall not the Foole stay with thee? Quee. Come away Sirra. Exeunt Queene, Ladies. Ton. How the Foole is sought for, sweet Malt is made of easie fire, A hasty horse will quickly tire, a sudden leaper sticks i'th mire, Phlebotomy and the word lye nier, take heed of friend I thee require; This from an Almanack I stole, and learnt this Lesson from a foole. Good night my Bird. Exit Tony Evan. Good night wise Master Tony; Will ye to bed my Lord? Come, let me help ye. Val. To bed Evanthe, art thou sleepy? Evan. No, I shall be worse if you look sad upon me, Pray ye let's to bed. Val. I am not well my love. Evan. Ile make ye well, there's no such Phisick for ye As your warme Mistris armes. Val. Art thou so cunning? Evan. I speake not by experience, pray ye mistake not; But if you love meâ Ual. I do love so dearely, So much above the base bent of desire I know not how to answer thee. Evan. To bed then, There I shall better credit yea; sie my Lord, Will ye put a maid too't, to teach ye what to do? An innocent maid? Are ye so cold a Lover? Intruth you make me blush, 'tis midnight too, And 'tis no stolne love, but authorised openly, No sin we covet, pray let me undresse ye, You shall help me; prethee sweet Valerio; Be not so sad, the King will be more mercifull. Val. May not I love thy minde? Evan. And I yours too, 'Tis a most noble one, adorn'd with vertue; But if we love not one another really, And put our bodies and our mindes together, And so make up the concord of affection, Our love will prove but a blinde superstition: This is no schoole to argue in my Lord, Nor have we time to talke away allow'd us, Pray let's dispatch, if any one should come And finde us at this distance, what would they think? Come, kisse me and to bed. Val. That I dare do, and kisse againe. Evan. Spare not, they are your owne Sir. Val. But to injoy thee is to be luxurious, Too sensuall in my love, and too ambitious; O how I burne! to pluck thee from the stalke, Where now thou grow'st a sweet bud and a beauteous, And bear'st the prime and honour of the Garden, Is but to violate thy spring, and spoile thee. Evan. To let me blow, and fall alone would anger ye. Val. Let's sit together thus, and as we sit Feed on the sweets of one anothers soules, The happinesse of love is contemplation, The blessednesse of love is pure affection, Where no allay of actuall dull desire, Of pleasure that partakes with wantonnesse, Of humane fire that burnes out as it kindles, And leaves the body but a poore repentance, Can ever mix, let's sixe on that Evanthe, That's everlasting, the tother casuall; Eternity breeds one, the other Fortune, Blinde as her selfe, and full of all afflictions. Shall we love vertuously? Evan. I ever loved so. Val. And only think our love; the rarest pleasure, And that we most desire, let it be humane, If once injoyed growes stale, and cloyes our appetites; I would not lessen in my love for any thing, Nor finde thee but the same in my short journey, For my loves safety. Evan. Now I see I am old Sir, Old and ill-favour'd too, poore and despis'd, And am not worth your noble Fellowship, Your fellowship in Love, you would not else Thus cunningly seeke to betray a maid, A maid that honours you thus piously; Strive to abuse the pious love she brings ye. Farewell my Lord, since ye have a better Mistris, For it must seeme so, or ye are no man, A younger, happier, I shall give her roome, So much I love ye still. Val. Stay my Evanthe, Heaven beare me witnesse, thou art all I love, All I desire, and now have pitty on me, I never lyed before; forgive me Justice, Youth and affection stop your eares unto me. Evan. Why do you weep? if I have spoke too harshly, And unbeseeming my beloved Lord, My care and duty, pardon me. Val. O heare me, Heare me Evanthe; I am all on torture And this lye tears my conscience as I vent it; I am no man. Evan. How Sir? Val. No man for pleasure, no womans man, Evan. Goodnesse forbid my Lord, sure you abuse your selfe: Val. 'Tis true Evanthe; I shame to say you will finde it. Weepes. Evan. He weepes bitterly, 'Tis my hard fortune, blesse all young maids from it; Is there no help my Lord in Art will comfort ye? Val. I hope there is. Evan. How long have you been destitute? Val. Since I was young. Evan. 'Tis hard to dye for nothing, Now you shall know 'tis not the pleasure Sir, (For I am compell'd to love you spiritually) That women aime at I affect ye for, 'Tis for your worth; and kisse me, be at peace, Because I ever loved ye I still honour'd ye, And with all duty to my Husband follow ye; Will ye to bed now? ye are asham'd it seemes; Pigmalion prayed and his cold stone took life, You do not know with what zeale I shall aske Sir, And what rare miracle that may worke upon ye; Still blush? prescribe your Law. Val. I prethee pardon me, To bed, and ile sit by thee, and mourne with thee, Mourne both our fortunes, our unhappy ones: Do not despise me, make me not more wretched, I pray to heaven when I am gone Evanthe, As my poore date is but a span of time now, To recompence thy noble patience, Thy love and vertue with a fruitfull husband, Honest and honourable. Evan. Come, you have made me weep now, All fond desire dye here, and welcome chastity, Honour and chastity, do what you please Sir. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter at one doore Rugio, and Frier Marco, at the other doore Sorano, with a little glasse violl. Rug. What ailes this peece of mischief to looke sad? He seemes to weep too. Mar. Something is a hatching, And of some bloody nature too Lord Rugio, This Crocadile mournes thus cunningly. Sor. Haile holy Father, And good day to the good Lord Rugio, How fares the sad Prince I beseech ye Sir? Rug. 'Tis like you know, you need not aske that question, You have your eyes, and watches on his miseries As neare as ours, I would they were as tender. Mar. Can you do him good? as the King and you appointed him, So he is still, as you desir'd I think too, For every day he is worse (Heaven pardon all) Put off your sorrow, you may laugh now Lord, He cannot last long to disturbe your Master, You have done worthy service to his Brother, And he most memorable love. Sor. You do not know Sir With what remorse I aske, nor with what wearinesse I grone and bow under this load of honour, And how my soule sighs for the beastly services, I have done his pleasures, these be witnesse with me, And from your piety beleeve me Father, I would as willingly unclothe my selfe Of title, that becomes me not I know; Good men, and great names best agree together; Cast off the glorious favours, and the trappings Of sound and honour, wealth and promises, His wanton pleasures have flung on my weaknesse, And chuse to serve my Countries cause and vertues, Poorely and honestly, and redeeme my rulnes, As I would hope remission of my mischiefes. Rug. Old and experienc'd men my Lord Sorano, Are not so quickly caught with gilt hypocrisie, You pull your clawes in now and fawne upon us, As Lyons do to intice poore foolish beasts; And beasts we should be too if we beleeved ye, Go exercise your Art. Sor. For heaven sake scorne me not, Nor adde more hell to my afflicted soule Then I feele here; as you are honourable, As you are charitable looke gently on me, I will no more to Court, be no more Devill, I know I must be hated even of him That was my Love now, and the more he loves me For his foule ends, when they shall once appeare to him, Muster before his conscience and accuse him, The fouler and the more falls his displeasure, Princes are fading things, so are their favours. Mar. He weeps agen, his heart is toucht sure with remorce. Sor. See this, and give me faire attention good my Lord, And worthy Father see, within this violl The remedy and cure of all my honour, And of the sad Prince lyes. Rug. What new trick's this? Sor. 'Tis true, I have done Offices abundantly Ill, and prodigious to the Prince Alphonso, And whilst I was a knave I sought his death too. Rug. You are too late convicted to be good yet. Sor. But Father, when I felt this part afflict me, This inward, and call'd me to an audit Of my misdeeds and mischiefesâ Mar. Well, go on Sir. Sor. O then, then, then, what was my glory then Father? The favour of the King, what did that ease me? What was it to be bow'd to by all creatures? Worshipt, and courted, what did this availe me? I was a wretch, a poore lost wretch. Mar. Still better. Sor. Till in the midst of all my griefe I found Repentance, and a learned man to give the meanes to it, A Jew, an honest and a rare Phisition, Of him I had this Jewell; 'tis a Jewell, And at the price of all my wealth I bought it: If the King knew it I must lose my head, And willingly, most willingly I would suffer, A childe may take it, 'tis so sweet in working. Mar. To whom would you apply it too? Sor. To the sick Prince, It will in halfe a day dissolve his melancholly. Rug. I do beleeve, and give him sleep for ever. What impudence is this, and what base malice, To make us instruments of thy abuses? Are we set here to poison him? Sor. Mistake not, yet I must needs say, 'tis a noble care, And worthy vertuous servants; if you will see A flourishing estate againe in Naples, And great Alphonso reigne that's truly good, And like himselfe able to make all excellent; Give him this drink, &amp; this good health unto him. Drinks I am not so desperate yet to kill my selfe, Never looke on me as a guilty man, Nor on the water as a speedy poison: I am not mad, nor laid out all my treasure, My conscience and my credit to abuse ye; How nimbly and how cheerefully it workes now Upon my heart and head, sure I am a new man There is no sadnesse that I feele within me, But as it meets it like a lazie vapour How it flyes off. Here, give it him with speed, You are more guilty then I ever was, And worthier of the name of evill subjects: If but an houre you hold this from his health. Rug. 'Tis some rare vertuous thing sure, he is a good man, It must be so, come, let's apply it presently, And may it sweetly work. Sor. Pray let me heare on't, and carry it close my Lords. Mar. Yes, good Sorano. Exit Rugio, Marco. Sor. Do my good fooles, my honest pious coxcombs, My wary fooles too, have I caught your wisedomes, You never dream't I knew an Antidote, Nor how to take it to secure mine owne life; I am an asse, go, give him the fine cordiall, And when you have done go dig his grave, good Frier, Some two houres hence we shall have such a bawling, And roaring up and downe for AquavitÃ¦, Such rubbing, and such nointing, and such cooling, I have sent him that will make a bonefire in's belly, If he recover it, there is no heat in Hell sure. Exit. Enter Frederick and Podrano. Fred. Podrano? Pod. Sir. Fred. Call hither Lord Valerio, and let none trouble us. Pod. It shall be done Sir. Exit. Enter Cassandra. Fred. I know he wants no additions to his tortures, He has enough for humane blood to carry, Yet I must vex him further; So many that I wonder his hot youth And high-bred spirit breakes not into fury; I must yet torture him a little further, And make my selfe sport with his miseries, My anger is too poore else. Here he comes, Valerio. Now my young married Lord, how do you feele your self? You have the happinesse you ever aimed at The joy and pleasure. Val. Would you had the like Sir. Fred. You tumble in delights with your sweet Lady, And draw the minutes out in deare embraces, You live a right Lords life. Val. Would you had tryed it, That you might know the vertue but to suffer, Your anger though it be unjust and insolent, Sits hansomer upon you then your scorne, To do a wilfull ill and glory in it, Is to do it double, double to be damn'd too. Fred. Hast thou not found a loving and free Prince, High in his favours too; that has confer'd Such hearts ease, and such heapes of comfort on thee, All thou coudest aske. Val. You are too growne a tyrant Upon so suffering, and so still a subject; You have put upon me such a punishment, That if your youth were honest it would blush at: But you are a shame to nature, as to vertue. Pull not my rage upon ye, 'tis so just, It will give way to no respect; my life, My innocent life, I dare maintaine it Sir, Like a wanton prodigall you have flung away, Had I a thousand more I would allow 'em, And be as carelesse of 'em as your will is; But to deny those rights the Law has given me, The holy Law, and make her life the pennance, Is such a studied and unheard of malice, No heart that is not hyred from Hell dare think of; To do it then too, when my hopes were high, High as my blood, all my desires upon me, My free affections ready to embrace her, And she mine owne; do you smile at this, ist done well? Is there not heaven above you that sees all? Come hither Time, how does your noble Mistris? Cass. As a Gentlewoman may do in her case that's newly married Sir: Sickly sometimes, and fond on't, like your Majesty. Fred. She is breeding then? Cass. She wants much of her cullour, And has her qualmes as Ladies use to have Sir, And her disgusts. Fred. And keeps her chamber? Cass. Yes Sir. Fred. And eats good Brooths and Jellies. Cass. I am sure she sighs Sir, and weepes, good Lady. Fred. Alas good Lady for it, She should have one could comfort her Cassandra, Could turne those teares to joyes, a lusty comforter. Cass. A comfortable man does well at all houres, For he brings comfortable things. Fred. Come hither, &amp; hold your face between, you have eaten Onions, Her breath stinks like a Fox, her teeth are contagious, These old women are all Elder-pipes, do ye mark me. Gives a Purse. Cass. Yes Sir, but does your Grace think I am fit, That am both old and vertuous. Fred. Therefore the fitter, the older still the better, I know thou art as holy as an old Cope, Yet upon necessary use. Cass. 'Tis true Sir. Fred. Her feeling sence is fierce still, speake unto her, You are familiar; speake I say unto her, Speake to the purpose; tell her this, and this. Cass. Alas, she is honest, Sir, she is very honest, And would you have my gravityâ Fred. I, I, your gravity will become the cause the better, Ile looke thee out a Knight shall make thee a Lady too, A lusty Knight, and one that shall be ruled by her; And adde to these, ile make 'em good, no mincing, Nor ducking out of nicity good Lady, But do it home, wee'l all be friends to tell her; And such a joyâ Cass. That's it that stirs me up Sir, I would not for the world attempt her chastity, But that they may live lovingly hereafter. Fred. For that I urge it too. Cass. A little evill may well be suffered for a generall good, Sir, Ile take my leave of your Majesty. Exit. Enter Valerio. Fred. Go fortunately, be speedy too, here comes Valerio, If his affliction have allayed his spirit My work has end. Come hither Lord Valerio, How do you now? Val. Your Majesty may ghesse, Not so well, nor so fortunate as you are, That can tye up mens honest wills and actions. Fred. You have the happinesse you ever aim'd at, The joy, and pleasure. Val. Would you had the like Sir. Fred. You tumble in delights with your sweet Lady, And draw the minutes out in deare embraces, You lead a right Lords life. Val. Would you had tryed it, That you might know the vertue but to suffer, If anger, though it be unjust and insolent Sits hansomer upon you then your scorne, Sir. Fred. You cleerly see now brave Valerio What 'tis to be the rivall to a Prince, To interpose against a raging Lion; I know you have suffer'd, infinitely suffer'd, And with a kinde of pitty I behold it, And if you dare be worthy of my mercy, I can yet heale you; yeeld up your Evanthe, Take off my sentence also. Val. I fall thus low Sir, My poore sad heart under your feet I lay, And all the service of my life. Fred. Do this then, for without this 'twill be impossible, Part with her for a while. Val. You have parted us, What should I do with that I cannot use Sir? Fred. 'Tis well consider'd, let me have the Lady, And thou shalt see how nobly ile befriend thee, How all this difference. Val. Will she come, do you think Sir? Fred. She must be wrought, I know she is too modest, And gently wrought, and cunningly. Val. 'I is fit Sir. Fred. And secretly it must be done. Val. As thought. Fred. Ile warrant ye, her honour shall be faire still, No soyle nor staine shall appeare on that, Valerio, You see a thousand that beare sober faces, And shew of as in-imitable modesties; You would be sworn to that, they were pure Matrons, And most chaste maids; and yet to augment their fortunes And get them noble friendsâ Val. They are content Sir, In private to bestow their beauties on 'em. Fred. They are so, and they are wise, they know no want for't, Nor no eye sees they want their honesties. Val. If it might be carried thus. Fred. It shall be Sir. Val. Ile see you dead first, with this caution, Why sure I think it might be done. Fred. Yes, easily. Val. For what time would your Grace desire her body? Fred. A moneth or two, it shall be carried still As if she kept with you, and were a stranger, Rather a hater of the Grace I offer: And then I will returne her with such honourâ Val. 'Tis very like I dote much on your honour. Fred. And load her with such favour to Valerioâ Val. She never shall claw off, I humbly thank ye. Fred. Ile make ye both the happiest, and the richest, And the mightiest tooâ Val. But who shall work her Sir, For on my conscience she is very honest, And will be hard to cut as a rough Diamond? Fred. Why you must work her, any thing from your tongue, Set off with golden and periwasive language, Urging your dangers too. Val. But all this time Have you the conscience Sir to leave me nothing, Nothing to play withall? Fred. There be a thousand, take where thou wilt. Ual. May I make bold with your Queene, She is uselesse to your Grace as it appeares Sir, And but a loyall wife that may be lost too; I have a minde to her, and then 'tis equall? Fred. How Sir? Val. 'Tis so Sir, thou most glorious impudence, Have I not wrongs enow to suffer under, But thou must pick me out to make a monster? A hated wonder to the world? Do you start At my intrenching on your private liberty, And would you force a hye-way through mine honour, And make me pave it too? but that thy Queene Is of that excellence in honesty, And guarded with Divinity about her, No loose thought can come neare, nor flame unhollowed, I would so right my selfe. Fred. Why take her to ye, I am not vext at this, thou shalt injoy her, Ile be thy friend if that may win thy courtesie. Val. I will not be your Bawd though for your Royalty. Was I brought up, and nourisht in the Court, With thy most Royall Brother and thy selfe, Upon thy Fathers charge, thy happy Fathers, And suckt the sweetnesse of all humane Arts, Learnt armes and honour to become a rascall; Was this the expectation of my youth, My growth of honour? Do ye speak this truly, Or do ye try me Sir? for I beleeve not, At least I would not, and me thinks 'tis impossible There should be such a Devill in a Kings shape, Such a malignant Fiend. Fred. I thank ye Sir, To morrow is your last day, and looke to it, Get from my sight, away. Val. Ye are, Oh, my heart's too high and full to think upon ye. Exeunt. Enter Evanthe and Cassandra. Evan. You think it fit then mortified Cassandra, That I should be a Whore? Cass. Why a whore, Madam? If every woman that upon necessity Did a good turne, for there's the maine point, mark it, Were term'd a whore, who would be honest, Madam? Your Lords life and your owne are now in hazard, Two precious lives may be redeem'd with nothing, Little or nothing; say an houres or dayes sport, Or such a toy, the end to it is wantonnesse. (That we call lust that maidens lose their fame for) But a compell'd necessity of honour, Faire as the day, and cleare as innocence, Upon my life and conscience a direct way.â Evan. To be a rascall. Cass. 'Tis a kinde of Rape too, That keeps you cleare, for where your will's compell'd, Though you yeeld up your body you are safe still. Evan. Thou art grown a learned Bawd, I ever look'd Thy great sufficiency would breake out. Cass. You may, You that are young and faire scorne us old creatures, But you must know my yeares ere you be wise Lady, And my experience too; say the King loved ye? Say it were nothing else? Evan. I marry wench, now thou comest to me. Cass. Doe you thinke Princes favours are such sleight things, To fling away when you please? there be young Ladies Both faire and honourable, that would leap to reach 'em, And leap aloft too. Evan. Such are light enough; I am no Valter, wench, but canst thou tell me, Though he be a King, whether he be sound or no? I would not give my youth up to infection. Cass. As sound as honour ought to be, I think Lady; Go too, be wise, I do not bid you try him; But if he love you well, and you neglect him, Your Lords life hanging on the hazard of it, If you be so wilfull proud. Evan. Thou speakest to the point still; But when I have lyen with him, what am I then, Gentlewoman? Cass. What are you? why the same you are now, a Woman, A vertuous woman, and a noble woman, Touching at what is noble, you become so. Had Lucrece e're been thought of, but for Tarquin? She was before a simple unknowne woman, When she was ravisht, she was a reverent Saint; And do you think she yeelded not a little? And had a kinde of will to have been re-ravisht? Believe it yes: There are a thousand stories Of wondrous loyall women, that have slipt, But it has been on the ice of tender honour, That kept 'em coole still to the world, I think you are blest, That have such an occasion in your hands to beget a Chronicle, A faithfull one. Evan. It must needs be much honour. Cass. As you may make it, infinite and safe too, And when 'tis done, your Lord and you may live So quietly and peaceably together, And be what you please. Evan. But suppose this, wench, The King should so delight me with his company, I should forget my Lord, and no more look on him. Cass. That's the maine hazard, for I tell you truly, I have heard report speak, is an infinite pleasure, Almost above beliefe: there be some Ladies, And modest to the world too, wondrous modest, That have had the blessednesse to try his body, That I have heard proclaime him a new Hercules. Evan. So strongly able? Cassan. There will be the danger, You being but a young and tender Lady, Although your minde be good, yet your weak body, At first encounter too, to meet with one Of his unconquer'd strength. Evan. Peace thou rude bawde, Thou studied old corruptnesse, tye thy tongue up, Your hired base tongue; is this your timely counsell? Dost thou seeke to make me dote on wickednesse? Because 'tis ten times worse then thou deliver'st it? To be a whore, because he has sufficiency. To make a hundred? O thou impudence, Have I relieved thy age to mine owne ruine? And worne thee in my bosome to betray me? Can yeares and impotence win nothing on thee That's good and honest, but thou must go on still? And where thy blood wants heat to sin thy selfe, Force thy decreped will to make me wicked. Cass. I did but tell ye. Evan. What the damned'st woman, The cunning'st and the skillful'st bawd comes short of: If thou had'st liv'd ten ages to be dam'd in, And exercised this art the Devill taught thee, Thou could'st not have exprest it more exactly. Cass. I did not bid you sin. Evan. Thou wood'st me to it, Thou that art fit for prayer and the grave, Thy body earth already, and corruption, Thou taught'st the way; go follow your fine function, There are houses of delight, that want good Matrons, Such grave instructors, get thee thither monster, And read variety of sins to wantons, And when they rore with paines, learne to make playsters. Cass. This we have for our good wills. Evan. If e're I see thee more, Or any thing that's like thee, to affright me, By this faire light ile spoile thy bawdery, Ile leave thee neither eyes nor nose to grace thee, When thou wantest bread, and common pitty towards thee, Enter Frederick. And art a starving in a ditch, think of me, Then die, and let the wandering bawds lament thee; Be gone, I charge thee, leave me. Cass. You'l repent this. Exit. Fred. She's angry, and t'other crying too, my suit's cold; Ile make your heart ake, stubborne wench, for this; Turne not so angry from me, I will speak to you, Are you growne proud with your delight, good Lady, So pamper'd with your sport, you scorne to know me? Evan. I scorne ye not, I would you scorn'd not me, Sir, And forc't me to be weary of my duty, I know your Grace, would I had never seene ye. Fred. Because I love you, because I dote upon ye, Because I am a man that seeke to please ye. Evan. I have man enough already to content me, As much, as noble, and as worthy of me, As all the world can yeeld. Fred. That's but your modesty, You have no man, nay never look upon me, I know it Lady, no man to content ye, No man that can, or at the least that dare, Which is a poorer man, and neerer nothing. Evan. Be nobler, Sir, inform'd. Fred. Ile tell thee, wench, The poore condition of this poorer fellow, And make thee blush for shame at thine owne errour, He never tendred yet a husbands duty, To thy warme longing bed. Evan. How should he know that? Fred. I am sure he did not, for I charg'd him no, Upon his life I charg'd him, but to try him; Could any brave or noble spirit stop here? Was life to be prefer'd before affection? Lawfull, and long'd for too? Evan. Did you command him? Fred. I did in policy to try his spirit. Evan. And could he be so dead cold to observe it? Brought I no beauty? nor no love along with me? Fred. Why what is it that makes me scorne to name him? I should have lov'd him, if he had venter'd for't, Nay, doted on his bravery. Evan. Onely charg'd? And with that spell sit downe? dare men fight bravely For poore slight things, for drink or ostentation? And there indanger both their lives and fortunes, And for their lawfull Loves fly off with feare? Fred. 'Tis true, and with a cunning base feare too to abuse thee; Made thee believe, poore innocent Evanthe, Wretched young girle, it was his impotency; Was it not so? deny it. Evan. O my anger, at my yeares to be cozen'd with a young man! Fred, A strong man too, certaine he lov'd ye deerly. Evan. To have my shame and love mingled together, And both flung on me like a wait to sinke me, I would have dyed a thousand times. Fred. So would any, Any that had the spirit of a man; I would have been kill'd in your armes. Evan. I would he had been, And buried in mine armes, that had been noble, And what a monument would I have made him? Upon this breast he should have slept in peace, Honour, and everlasting love his mourners; And I still weeping till old time had turn'd me, And pittying powers above into pure christall. Fred. Hadst thou lov'd me, and had my way been stuck With deaths, as thick as frosty nights with stars, I would have ventur'd. Evan. Sure there is some trick in't; Valerio ne're was coward. Fred. Worse then this too, Tamer, and seasoning of a baser nature, He set your woman on ye to betray ye, Your bawdy woman, or your sin solicitor: I pray but think what this man may deserve now, I know he did, and did it to please me too. Evan. Good Sir afflict me not too fast, I feele I am a woman, and a wrong'd one too, And sensible I am of my abuses, Sir, you have loved me. Fred. And I love thee still, pitty thy wrongs, and dote upon thy person. Evan. To set my woman on me 'twas too base Sir. Fred. Abominable vilde. Evan. But I shall fit him. Fred. All reason and all Law allowes it to ye, And ye are a foole, a tame foole, if you spare him. Evan. You may speake now, and happily prevaile too, And I beseech your Grace be angry with me. Fred. I am at heart. She staggers in her faith, And will fall off I hope, Ile ply her still. Thou abused innocence, I suffer with thee If I should give him life, he would still betray thee; That foole that feares to dye for such a beauty, Would for the same feare sell thee unto misery? I do not say he would have been bawd himself too. Evan. Follow'd thus far? nay then I smell the malice, It tasts too hot of practis'd wickednesse, There can be no such man, I am sure no Gentleman: Shall my anger make me whore, and not my pleasure? My sudden unconsiderate rage abuse me? Come home againe, my frighted faith, my vertue, Home to my heart againe: he be a bawd too? Fred. I will not say, he offered faire Evanthe. Evan. Nor do not dare, 'twill be an impudence, And not an honour for a Prince to lye; Fie Sir, a person of your ranke to trifle, I know you do lye. Fred. How? Evan. Lye shamefully, and I could wish my selfe a man but one day, To tell you openly you lye too, basely. Fred. Take heed wilde foole. Evan. Take thou heed thou tame Devill, Thou all Pandora's box in a Kings figure, Thou hast almost whor'd my weake beliefe already, And like an Engineer blowne up mine honour; But I shall countermine, and catch your mischiefe, This little Fort you seeke, I shall man nobly, And strongly too, with chaste obedience To my deere Lord, with vertuous thoughts that scorne ye. Victorious Tameris nere won more honour In cutting off the Royall head of Cyrus, Then I shall do in conquering thee; farewell, And if thou canst be wise, learne to be good too, 'Twill give thee nobler lights then both thine eyes do; My poore Lord and my selfe are bound to suffer, And when I see him faint under your sentence, Ile tell ye more, it may be then Ile yeeld too. Fred. Foole, unexampled, shall my anger follow thee? Exeunt. Enter Rugio, and Fryer Marco, amazed. Rugio. Curst on our sights, our fond credulities, A thousand curses on the slave that cheated us. The damn'd slave. Mar. We have e'ne sham'd our service, Brought our best care and loyalties to nothing, 'Tis the most fearefull poyson, the most potent, Heaven give him patience; oh it works most strongly, And teares him Lord. Rug. That we should be so stupid, To trust the arrant'st villaine that e're flatter'd, The bloodiest too, to believe a few soft words from him, And give way to his prepar'd teares. Within Alphonso. Oh, oh, oh. Rug. Harke Fryer Marco, harke, the poore Prince, that we should be such blockheads, As to be taken with his drinking first? And never think what Antidotes are made for? Two wooden sculls we have, and we deserve to be hang'd for't; For certainly it will be laid to our charge; As certaine too, it will dispatch him speedily, Which way to turne, or what to.â Mar. Lets pray, Heavens hand is strong. Rug. The Poysons strong, you would say. Enter Alphonso, carried in a Coach by two Fryers. Would any thingâHe comes, let's give him comfort. Alphon. Give me more ayre, ayre, more ayre, blow, blow, Open thou Easterne gate, and blow upon me, Distill thy cold dewes, O thou icy Moone, And rivers run through my afflicted spirit, I am all fire, fire, fire, the raging dog star Raines in my blood, oh which way shall I turne me? Ãtna and all his flames burne in my head, Fling me into the Ocean or I perish: Dig, dig, dig, till the springs fly up, The cold, cold springs, that I may leap into 'em, And bathe my scorcht limbs in their purling pleasures; Or shoot me up into the higher Region, Where treasures of delicious snow are nourisht, And banquets of sweet haile. Rug. Hold him fast Fryer, O how he burnes! Alph. What will ye sacrifice me? Upon the Altar lay my willing body? And pile your wood up, fling your holy incense? And as I turne me you shall see all flame, Consuming flame, stand off me, or you are ashes. Both. Most miserable wretches. Alph. Bring hither charity And let me hug her, Fryer, they say she's cold, Infinite cold, devotion cannot warme her; Draw me a river of false lovers teares Cleane through my brest, they are dull, cold, and forgetfull, And will give ease, let Virgins sigh upon me, Forsaken soules, the sighs are precious, Let them all sigh: oh hell, hell, hell, oh horror. Mar. To bed, good Sir. Alpho. My bed will burne about me, Like Phaeton, in all consuming flashes I am in closed, let me fly, let me fly, give roome; Betwixt the cold beare, and the raging Lyon Lyes my safe way; O for a cake of ice now, To clap unto my heart to comfort me; Decrepid winter hang upon my sholders, And let me weare thy frozen Isicles Like Jewels round about my head, to coole me; My eyes burne out, and sinke into their sockets, And my infected braine like brimstone boyles, I live in hell, and severall furies vex me; O carry me where no Sun ever shew'd yet A face of comfort, where the earth is christall, Never to be dissolv'd, where nought inhabits But night and cold, and nipping frosts, and winds That cut the stubborne rocks, and make them shiver; Set me there friends. Rug. Hold fast, he must to bed Fryer, what scalding sweats he has? Mar. He'le scalld in hell for't, that was the cause. Alph. Drinke, drinke, a world of drinke, Fill all the cups, and all the antick vessels, And borrow pots, let me have drinke enough, Bring all the worthy drunkards of the time, The experienc'd drunkards, let me have them all, And let them drinke their worst, Ile make them Ideots, Ile lye upon my Back and swallow Vessels; Have Rivers made of cooling wine run through me, Not stay for this mans health, or this great Princes, But take an Ocean, and begin to all; oh, oh. Mar. He cooles a little, now away with him, And to his warme bed presently. Alph. No drinke? no winde? no cooling aire? Rug. You shall have any thing. His hot fit lessens, Heaven put in a hand now, And save his life; there's drink Sir in your chamber, And all coole things. Alpb. Away, away, lets fly to 'em. Exeunt. Enter Valerio and Evanthe. Evan. To say you were impotent, I am asham'd on't, To make your self no man, to a fresh maid too, A longing maid, upon her wedding night also, To give her such a dor. Val. I prethee pardon me. Evan. Had you been drunke, 'thad been excusable, Or like a Gentleman under the Surgeons hands, And so not able, there had been some colour, But wretchedly to take a weaknesse to ye, A fearefull weaknesse, to abuse your body, And let a lye worke like a spell upon ye, A lye, to save your life. Val. Will you give me leave sweet? Evan. You have taken too much leave, and too base leave too, To wrong your Love; hast thou a noble spirit? And canst thou looke up to the peoples loves, That call thee worthy, and not blush Valerio? Canst thou behold me that thou hast betraid thus? And no shame touch thee? Val. Shame attend the sinfull, I know my innocence. Evan. Ne're think to face it, that's a double weaknesse, And shewes thee falser still; the King himselfe, Though he be wicked, and our Enemy, But juster then thine, in pitty of my injuries, Told me the truth. Val. What did he tell Evanthe? Evan. That but to gaine thy life a fortnight longer, Thy lov'd poore life, thou gav'st up all my duties. Val. I sweare 'tis false, my life and death are equall, I have weigh'd 'em both, and finde 'em but one fortune, But Kings are men, and live as men, and dye too, Have the affections men have, and their falsehoods; Indeed they have more power to make 'em good; The King's to blame, it was to save thy life wench, Thy innocent life, that I forbore thy bed, For if I had toucht thee thou hadst dyed, he swore it. Evan. And was not I as worthy to dye nobly? To make a story for the times that follows, As he that married me? what weaknesse, Sir, Or dissability do you see in me, Either in minde or body? to defraud me Of Such an opportunity? Do you think I married you Only for pleasure, or content in lust? To lull you in mine armes, and kisse you hourely? Was this my end? I might have been a Queen, Sir, If that had caught me, and have knowne all delicates; There's few that would have shun'd so faire an offer, O thou unfaithfull fearefull man, thou hast kill'd me, In saving me this way, thou hast destroy'd me, Rob'd me of that thy love can never give more; To be unable to save me? O misery! Had I been my Valerio, thou Evanthe, I would have lyen with thee under a Gallowes, Though the Hangman had been my Hymen, and the furies With iron whips and forks, ready to torter me, I would have hug'd thee too, though hell had gap'd at me; Save my life! that expected to dye bravely, That would have woo'd it too? Would I had married An Eunuch, that had truly no ability, Then such a fearefull lyar, thou hast done me A scurvy curtesie, that has undone me. Val. Ile do no more, since you are so nobly fashion'd, Made up so strongly, Ile take my share with ye, Nay Deere, Ile learne of you. Evan. He weeps too tenderly; My angers gone, good my Lord pardon me, And if I have offended, be more angry, It was a womans flash, a sudden valour, That could not lye conceal'd. Val. I honour ye by all the rights of holy marriage, And pleasures of chaste love, I wonder at ye, You appeare the vision of a Heaven unto me, Stuck all with stars of honour shining cleerly, And all the motions of your minde celestiall; Man is a lumpe of earth, the best man spiritlesse, To such a woman; all our lives and actions But counterfeits in Arras to this vertue; Chide me againe, you have so brave an anger, And flowes so nobly from you, thus deliver'd, That I could suffer like a childe to heare ye, Nay make my self guilty of some faults to honour ye. Evan. Ile chide no more, you have rob'd me of my courage. And with a cunning patience checkt my impudence; Once more forgivenesse? She kneeles. Val. Will this serve Evanthe? Kisses her. And this my love? Heavens mercy be upon us; But did he tell no more? Evan. Only this trifle: You set my woman on me, to betray me; 'Tis true, she did her best, a bad old woman, It stir'd me Sir. Val. I cannot blame thee, Jewell. Evan. And me thought when your name was sounded that wayâ Val. He that will spare no fame, will spare no name Sweet; Though as I am a man, I am full of weaknesse, And may slip happily into some ignorance, Yet at my yeeres to be a bawd, and cozen Mine owne hopes with my Doctrineâ Evan. I beleeve not, nor never shall; our time is out to morrow. Val. Let's be too night then full of fruitfulnesse, Now we are both of one minde, let's be happy, I am no more a wanting man Evanthe, Thy warme embraces shall dissolve that impotence, And my cold lye shall vanish with thy kisses; You houres of night be long, 'as when Alemena Lay by the lusty side of Jupiter; Keep back the day, and hide his golden beames, Where the chaste watchfull morning may not finde 'em; Old doting Tython hold Aurora fast, And though she blush the day-break from her cheeks, Conceale her still; thou heavy Walne stand firme, And stop the quicker revolutions; Or if the day must come, to spoile our happinesse, Thou envious Sunne peepe not upon our pleasure, Thou that all Lovers curse, be farre off from us. Enter Castruchio with Guard. Evan. Then let's to bed, and this night in all joyes And chaste delightsâ Cast. Stay, I must part ye both; It is the Kings command, who bids me tell ye, To morrow is your last houre. Val. I obey, Sir, In Heaven we shall meet, Captaine, where King Frederick Dare not appeare to part us. Cast. Mistake me not, though I am rough in doing of my Office, You shall finde, Sir, you have a friend to honour ye. Val. I thank ye Sir. Evan. Pray Captaine tell the King, They that are sad on Earth, in Heaven shall sing. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Fryer Marco, and Rugio. Rug. Have you writ to the Captaine of the Castle? Mar. Yes, and charged him Upon his soules health, that he be not cruell, Told him Valerio's worth among the people, And how it must be punisht in posterity, Though he scape now. Rug. But will not he, Fryer Marco, betray this to the King? Mar. Though he be stubborne, and of a rugged nature, yet he is honest, And honours much Valerio. Rug. How doe's Alphonso? For now me thinks my heart is light againe, And pale feare fled. Mar. He is as well as I am; The Rogue against his will has sav'd his life, A desperate poyson has re-cur'd the Prince. Rug. To me 'tis most miraculous. Mar. To me too, till I consider why it should do so, And now I have found it a most excellent Physick, It wrought upon the dull cold misty parts, That clog'd his soule, which was another poyson, A desperate too, and found such matter there, And such abundance also to resist it, And weare away the dangerous heat it brought with it, The pure blood and the spirits scap'd untainted. Rug, 'Twas Heavens high hand, none of Sorano's pitty. Mar. Most certaine 'twas, had the malitious villaine Enter Castruchio Given him a cooling poyson, he had paid him. Rug. The Captain of the Castle. Mar. O ye are welcome, how doe's your Prisoner? Cast. He must go for dead; But when I do a deed of so much villany, Ile have my skin pull'd o're mine eares, my Lord, Enter Alphonso, and Fryers, Though I am the Kings, I am none of his abuses; How doe's your Royall Charge? that I might see once. Mar. I pray see now, you are a trusty Gentleman. Alph. Good Fathers, I thanke Heaven, I feele no sicknesse, Cast. He speaks againe. Alph. Nothing that barres the free use of my spirit, Me thinks the ayre's sweet to me, and company A thing I covet now Castruchio. Cast. Sir, he speaks, and knowes, for Heaven sake break my pate Lord, That I may be sure I sleep not. Alph. Thou wert honest. Ever among the rank of good men counted, I have been absent long out of the world, A dreame I have lived, how doe's it looke Castruchio? What wonders are abroad? Cast. I fling off duty to your dead Brother, for he is dead in goodnesse, And to the living hope of brave Alphonso, The noble heire of nature, and of honour, I fasten my Allegeance. Mar, Softly Captaine, we dare not trust the ayre with this blest secret, Good Sir, be close againe, heaven has restor'd ye, And by miraculous meanes, to your faire health, And made the instrument your enemies malice, Which doe's prognosticate your noble fortune; Let not our carelesse joy lose you againe, Sir, Help to deliver ye to a further danger, I pray you passe in, and rest a while forgotten, For if your brother come to know you are well againe, And ready to inherit as your right, Before we have strength enough to assure your life, What will become of you? and what shall we Deserve in all opinions that are honest, For our losse of judgement, care, and loyalty? Rug. Deere Sir, passe in, Heaven has begun the worke, And blest us all, let our indeavours follow, To preserve this blessing to our timely uses, And bring it to the noble end we aime at; Let our cares worke now, and our eyes pick out An houre to shew ye safely to your Subjects, A secure houre. Alph. I am counsell'd; ye are faithfull. Cast. Which houre shall not be long, as we shall handle it. Once more the tender of my duty. Alph. Thank ye. Castr. Keep you the Monastery. Rug. Strong enough Ile warrant ye. Exeunt. Enter the Foole, and Podrano. Pod. Who are all these that crowde about the Court Foole? Those strange new faces? Foole. They are Suitors Coxcombe, Dainty fine Suitors to the widow Lady, Thou hadst best make one of 'em, thou wilt be hang'd as handsomly At the Moneths end, and with as much joy follow'd, And 'twere to morrow; as many mourning bawds for thee, And holy Nuns, whose vestall fire ne're vanishes, In sackcloth smocks, as if thou wert Heire apparent To all the impious Suburbs, and the sink-holes. Pod. Out you base rogue. Foole. Why dost abuse thy selfe, Thou art to blame, I take thee for a Gentleman, But why doe's not thy Lord and Master marry her? Pod. Why, she is his sister. Foole. 'Tis the better Foole, He may make bold with his owne flesh and blood, For a my conscience there's none else will trust him, Then he may pleasure the King at a dead pinch too, Without a Mephestophilus, such as thou art, And ingrosse the royall disease like a true Subject. Pod. Thou wilt be whipt. Foole. I am sure thou wilt be hangd, I have lost a Ducket else, which I would be loath to venter Without certainty. They appeare. Pod. Why these are rascals. Foole. They were meant to be so, doo's thy Master deserve better kinred? Pod. Ther's an old Lawyer, Trim'd up like a Gally Foist, what would he do with her? Foole. As Userers do with their Gold, he would looke on her, And read her over once a day, like a hard report, Feed his dull eye, and keepe his fingers itching; For any thing else, she may appeale to a Parliament, Sub PÃ¦na's and Post Kaes have spoil'd his Codpeece; There's a Physitian too, older then he, And Gallen Gallenatius, but he has lost his spurres, He would be nibling too. Pod. I marked the man, if he be a man. Foole. Has much a do to be so, Searecloths and Sirrops glew him close together, He would fall a peeces else; mending of she patients, And then trying whether they be right or no, In his owne person, there's the honest care an't, Has mollifi'd the man; if he do marry her, And come but to warme him well at Cupids bonfire, He will bulge so subtilly and suddenly, You may snatch him up by parcels, like a Sea Rack: Will your Worship go, and looke upon the rest, Sir? And heare what they can say for themselves. Pod. I'le follow thee. Exeunt. Enter Camillo, Menallo, Cleanthes, Castruchio. Cam. You tell us wonders. Cast. But I tell you truths, they are both well. Men. Why are not we in Armes then? And all the Island given to knowâ Cast. Discreetly and privately it must be done, 'twill misse else, And prove our ruines; most of the noble Citizens Know it by me, and stay the houre to attend it, Prepare your hearts and friends, let their's be right too, And keepe about the King to avoid suspition; Enter Frederick and Sorano. When you shall heare the Castle Bell, take courage, And stand like men, away, the King is comming. Exeunt Lords. Fre. Now Captain, what have you done with your Prisoner? Cast. He is dead, Sir, and his body flung i'th Sea, To feed the fishes, 'twas your will, I take it, I did it from a strong Commission, And stood not to capitulate. Fred. 'Tis well done, And I shall love you for your faith. What anger Or sorrow did he utter at his end? Castr. Faith little, Sir, that I gave any eare to, He would have spoke, but I had no Commission To argue with him, so I flung him off; His Lady would have seene, but I lockt her up, For feare her womans teares should hinder us. Fred. 'Twas trusty still. I wonder, my Sorano, We heare not from the Monastery; I believe They gave it not, or else it wrought not fully. Cast. Did you name the Monastery? Fred. Yes, I did Captaine. Cast. I saw the Fryer this morning, and Lord Rugio, Bitterly weeping, and wringing of their hands, And all the holy men hung downe their heads. Sora. 'Tis done, Ile warrant ye. Cast. I asked the reason. Fred. What answer hadst thou? Cast. This in few words, Sir, Your Brothers dead, this morning he deceased, I was your servant, and I wept not, Sir, I knew 'twas for your good. Fred. It shall be for thine too, Captaine, indeed it shall. O my Sorano, Now we shall live. Sor. I, now there's none to trouble ye. Fred. Captaine, bring out the woman, and give way To any Suitor that shall come to marry her, Of what degree soever. Cast. It shall be done, Sir. Exit Cap. Fre. O let me have a lusty Banquet after it, Enter Evanthe, Camillo, Cleanthes, Menallo, Foole, Castruchio. I will be high and merry. Sor. There be some Lords That I could counsell ye to fling from Court, Sir, They pry into our actions, they are such The foolish people call their Countries honours, Honest brave things, and stile them with such Titles; As if they were the patternes of the Kingdome, Which makes them proud, and prone to looke into us, And talk at randome of our actions, They should be your lovers of your commands; And followers of your will; bridles and curbs To the hard headed Commons that maligne us, They come here to do honour to my sister, To laugh at your severity, and fright us; If they had power, what would these men do? Do you heare, Sir, how privily they whisper? Fred. I shall silence 'em, And to their shames within this weeke Sorano; In the meane time have patience. Sor. How they jeere, and looke upon me as I were a Monster? And talk and jeere, How I shall pull your plumes, Lords How I shall humble ye within these two daies, Your great names, nor your Country cannot save ye. Fred. Let in the Suitors. Yet submit, Ile pardon ye, You are halfe undone already, do not winde My anger to that height, it may consume ye. Enter Lawyer, Physitian, Captain Cutpurse. And utterly destroy thee, faire Evanthe: yet I have mercy. Evan. Use it to your bawds, To me use cruelty, it best becomes ye, And shewes more Kingly: I contemne your mercy, It is a cozening, and a bawdy mercy; Can any thing be hoped for, to relieve me? Or is it fit? I thank you for a pitty, when you have kill'd my Lord. Fred. Who will have her? Evan. My teares are gone, My teares of love to my deere Valerio, But I have fill'd mine eyes againe with anger; O were it but so powerfull to consume ye, My tongue with curses I have arm'd against ye, With Maiden curses, that Heaven crownes with horrors, My heart set round with hate against thy tyranny; O would my hands could hold the fire of Heaven, Wrapt in the thunder that the Gods revenge with, That like sterne Justice I might fling it on thee; Thou art a King of Monsters, not of men, And shortly thou wilt turne this Land to Devills. Fred. Ile make you one first, and a wretched Devill, Come, who will have her? Law. I an't like your Majesty, I am a Lawyer, I can make her a Joynter of any mans Land in Naples, And she shall keepe it too, I have a trick for it. Foole. Canst thou make her a Joynter of thine honesty? Or thy ability, thou lewd abridgement? Those are non-suted and flung o're the barre. Physitian. An't please your Majesty to give me leave, I dare accept her; and though old I seeme, Lady, Like Eason, by my art I can renew youth and ability. Foole. In a powdring Tub Stew thy selfe tender againe, like a Cock Chicken, The broth may be good, but the flesh is not fit for doggs sure; Capt. Lady, take me, and Ile maintaine thine honour, I am a poore Captaine, as poore people call me, Very poore people, for my Souldiers They are quartered in the outsides of the City, Men of ability, to make good a high way; We have but two grand Enemies that oppose us, The Don Gout, and the Gallowes. Foole. I believe ye, and both these you will binde her for a Joynter; Now Signior firke. Cut-purse. Madam, take me and be wise, I am rich and nimble, and those are rare in one man, Every mans pocket is my Treasury, And no man weares a Sute but fits me neatly; Clothes you shall have, and weare the purest Linnen, I have a tribute out of every Shop, Lady, Meat you shall eat, I have my Caters out too, The best and lustiest, and drinke good Wine, good Lady, Good quickening Wine, Wine that will make you caper, And at the worstâ Foole. It is but capring short, Sir, You seldome stay for Agues or for Surfets, A shaking fit of a whip sometimes o're takes ye, Marry you dye most commonly of chokings, Obstructions of the halter are your ends ever; Pray leave your horne and your knife for her to live on. Evan. Poore wretched people, why do you wrong your selves? Though I fear'd death, I should fear you ten times more, You are every one a new death, and an odious, The earth will purifie corrupted bodies, You'le make us worse, and stinke eternally. Go home, go home, and get good Nerces for you, Dreame not of wives. Fred. You shall have one of 'em, if they dare venter for ye. Evan. They are dead already, Crawling diseases that must creep into The next grave they finde open, are these fit husbands For her you have loved Sir, though you hate me now, And hate me mortally, as I hate you, Your noblenesse in that you have done otherwise, And named Evanthe once as your poore Mistris, Might offer worthier choice. Fred. Speake, who dare take her for one moneth, and then dye? Phi. Dye Sir? Fred. I, dye Sir, that's the condition. Phi. One moneth is too little For me to repent in for my former pleasure, To go still on, unlesse I were sure she would kill me, And kill me delicately before my day, Make it up a yeare, for by that time I must dye, My body will hold out no longer. Fred. No Sir, it must be but a moneth. Lawy. Then farewell Madam, This is like to be great yeare of dissention Among good people, and I dare not lose it, There will be money got. Capt. Blesse your good Ladiship, there's nothing in the grave but bones and ashes, In Tavernes there's good wine, and excellent wenches, And Surgeons while we live. Cutp. Adieu sweet Lady, Lay me when I am dead neare a rich Alderman, I cannot pick his Purse, no, ile no dying, Though I steale Linnen, ile not steale my shrowde yet. All. Send ye a happy march. Exeunt. Foole. And you all halters, you have deserved 'em richly These do all Villanies, an mischiefes of all sorts, yet those they feare not To flinch where a faire wench is at the stake. Evan. Come, your sentence, let me dye, you see Sir, None of your valiant men dare venture on me, A moneth's a dangerous thing. Enter Valerio disguis'd. Fred. Away with her, let her dye instantly. Evan. Will you then be willing To dye at the time prefixt, that I must know too, And know it beyond doubt. Fred. What if I did wench? Evan. On that condition if I had it certaine, I would be your any thing, and you should injoy me, How ever in my nature I abhor you, Yet as I live I would be obedient to you; But when your time came how I should rejoyce, How then I should bestir my selfe to thanke ye To see your throat cut, how my heart would leap Sir, I would dye with you, but first I would so torter ye, And cow you in your end, so dispise you, For a weak and wretched coward, you must end sure; Still make ye feare, and shake, dispised, still laugh at ye. Fred. Away with her, let her dye instantly. Cam. Stay, there's another, and a Gentleman, His habit shewes no lesse, may be his businesse Is for this Ladies love. Fred. Say why ye come Sir, and what you are. Val. I am discended nobly, a Prince by birth, and by my trade a Souldier, A Princes fellow, Abidig brought me forth, My Parents Duke Agenor, and faire Egla, My Parents Duke Agenor and faire Egla, My businesse hither to renew my love With a young noble spirit, call'd Valerio; Our first acquiantance was at Sea, in fight Against a Turkish man of War, a stout one, Where Lyon-like I saw him shew his valour, And as he had been made of compleat vertue, Spirit, and sire, no dreggs of dull earth in him. Evan. Thou art a brave Gentleman, and bravely speakest him. Val. The Vessell dancing under him for joy, And the rough whisling winds becalm'd to view him; I saw the childe of honour, for he was young, Deale such an Almes amongst the spightfull pagans, His towring sword flew like an eager Falcon, And round about his reach invade the Turks, He had intrencht himselfe in his dead quarryes; The silver Cressents on the tops they carried Shranke in their heads to see his rage so bloody, And from his fury suffered sad ecclipses; The game of death was never plaid more nobly, The meager theefe grew wanton in his mishchiefes, And his shrunke hollow eyes smil'd on his ruines. Evan. Heaven keepe this Gentleman from being a Suitor, For I shall ne're deny him, he's so noble. Val. But what can last long? strength and spirit wasted, And fresh supplies flew on upon this Gentleman, Breathlesse and weary with oppression, And almost kill'd with killing, 'twas my chance In a tall Ship I had to view the fight; I set into him, entertain'd the Turke. And for an houre gave him so hot a breakfast, He clapt all linnen up he had to save him, And like a Lovers thought he fled our fury; There first I saw the man I lov'd, Valerio, There was acquainted, there my soul grew to him, And his to me, we were the twins of friendship. Eva. Fortune protect this man, or I shall ruine him. Val. I made this voyage to behold my friend, To warme my love a new at his affection; But since I landed, I have heard his fate: My Fathers had not been to me more cruell, I have lamented too, and yet I keepe The treasure of a few teares for you Lady, For by description you were his Evanthe. Evan. Can he weep that's a stranger to my story? And I stand still and looke on? Sir, I thank ye; If noble spirits after their departure, Can know, and wish, certaine his soule gives thanks too; There are your teares againe, and when yours faile Sir, Pray ye call to me, I have some store to lende ye. Your name? Val. Urbino. Evan. That, I may remember, That little time I have to live, your friendships, My tongue shall study both. Fred. Do you come hither, only to tell this story Prince Urbino? Val. My businesse now is, Sir, to wooe this Lady. Evan. Blessing defend ye; Do you know the danger? Val. Yes, and I feare it not, danger's my play-fellow, Since I was man 'thas been my best companion, I know your doome, 'tis for a Moneth you give her, And then his life you take that marries her. Fred. 'Tis true, nor can your being borne a Prince, If you accept the offer, free you from it. Val. I not desire it, I have cast the worst, And even that worst to me is many blessings; I lov'd my friend, not measur'd out by time, Nor hired by circumstance of place and honour, But for his wealthy selfe and worth I lov'd him, His minde and noble mold he ever mov'd in, And woe his friend because she was worthy of him, The only relick that he left behinde, Sir; To give his ashes honour, Lady take me, And in me keepe Valerio's love alive still, When I am gone, take those that shall succeed me, Heaven must want light, before you want a husband, To raise up Heires of love and noble memory, To your unfortunateâ Evan. Am I still hated? hast thou no end, O fate, of my affliction? Was I ordained to be a common Murdresse? And of the best men too? Good Sir. Val. Peace Sweet, looke on my hand. Evan. I do accept the Gentleman, I faint with joy. Fred. I stop it, none shall have her, convey this stranger hence. Val. I am no stranger.âHarke to the bell, that rings, Harke, harke, proud Frederick, that was King of mischief. Harke, thou abhorred man, dost thou heare thy sentence? Doe's not this bell ring in thine eares thy ruine? Fred. What bell is this? Cam. The Castle bell: Stand sure Sir, and move not, if you do you perish. Men. It rings your knell; Alphonso, King Alphonso. All. Alphonso, King Alphonso. Fred. I am betraid, lock fast the Palace. Cam. We have all the keyes, Sir. And no doore here shall shut without our Licence. Cle. Do you shake now Lord Sorano? no new trick? Nor speedy poyson to prevent this businesse? No bawdy meditation now to fly to? Fred. Treason, Treason, Treason. Cam. Yes, we heare ye, Enter Alphonso, Rugio, Marco, Castruchio, Queene, with Guard. And we have found the Traytor in your shape, Sir, Wee'l keep him fast too. Fred. recover'd! then I am gone, The Sun of all my pompe is set and vanisht. Alp. Have you not forgot this face of mine, King Frederick? Brother I am come to see you, and have brought A Banquet to be merry with your Grace; I pray sit downe, I do beseech your Majesty And eat, eat freely, Sir, why do you start? Have you no stomack to the meat I bring you? Dare you not taste? have ye no Antidotes? You need not feare; Sorano's a good Apothecary, Me thinks you looke not well, some fresh wine for him, Some of the same he sent me by Sorano; I thank you for't, it sav'd my life, I am bound to ye, But how 'twill worke on youâI hope your Lordship Will pledge him too, me thinks you looke but scurvily, And would be put into a better colour, But I have a canded Toad for your good Lordship. Sor. Would I had any thing that would dispatch me, So it were downe, and I out of this feare once. Fred. Sir, Thus low as my duty now compells me, I do confesse my unbounded sinnes, my errours, And feele within my soule the smarts already; Hide not the noble nature of a brother, The pitty of a friend, from my afflictions; Let me a while lament my misery, And cast the load off of my wantonnesse, Before I finde your fury, then strike home, I do deserve the deepest blow of Justice, And then how willingly, O death, Ile meet thee. Alp. Rise, Madam, those sweet tears are potent speakers, And brother live, but in the Monastery, Where I lived, with the selfe same silence too, Ile teach you to be good against your will brother, Your tongue has done much harme, that must be dumbe now; The daily pilgrimage to my fathers Tombe, Teares, sighs, and groanes, you shall weare out your daies with, And true ones too, you shall performe deare brother; Your diet shall be slender to inforce these; to light a pennance, Sir. Fred. I do confesse it. Alph. Sorano you shallâ Sor. How he studies for it, Hanging's the least part of my pennance certaine. Evanthe kneeles. Alph. What Lady's that that kneeles? Cast. The chaste Evanthe. Alph. Sweet, your petition? Evan. 'Tis for this bad man, Sir, Abominable bad, but yet my brother. Alph. The bad man shall attend as bad a Master, And both shall be confin'd within the Monastery; His ranke flesh shall be pull'd with daily fasting, But once a week he shall smell meat, he will surfet else, And his immodest minde compell'd to prayer; On the bare bords he shall lye, to remember The wantonnesse he did commit in beds; And drinke faire water, that will ne're inflame him; He sav'd my life, though he purpos'd to destroy me, For which Ile save his, though I make it miserable: Madam, at Court I shall desire your company, You are wise and vertuous, when you please to visit My brother Frederick, you shall have our Licence, My deere best friend, Valerio. Val. Save Alphonso. Omn. Long live Alphonso, King of us, and Naples. Alph. Is this the Lady that the wonder goes on? Honour'd sweet maid, here take her my Valerio, The King now gives her, she is thine owne without feare: Brother, have you so much provision that is good? Not season'd by Sorano and his Cooks? That we may venture on with honest safety, We and our friends? Fred. All that I have is yours, Sir. Alph. Come then, let's in, and end this Nuptiall, Then to our Coronation with all speed: My vertuous maid, this day Ile be your Bride-man, And see you bedded to your owne desires too; Beshrew me Lords, who is not merry hates me, Onely Sorano shall not beare my cup: Come, now forget old paines and injuries, As I must do, and drowne all in faire healths; That Kingdom's blessed, where the King begins His true love first, for there all loves are twins. Exeunt Omnes,</field>
