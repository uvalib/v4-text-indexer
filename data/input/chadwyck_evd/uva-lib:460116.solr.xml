      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÆ. Sir Walter Scroop. The Earl of Leicester. Sir Hugh de Lacy. Ambrose, a monk. Andrew, servant to Sir Walter. Peter, a soldier. Sir Reginald, sirnamed De Tours. Griffith, squire to Sir Hugh de Lacy. Lady Scroop. Lady Adela de Bellamont, daughter to the Earl of Leicester. Knights, Monks, &amp;c.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene, a Grove of Trees, under which Sir Walter Scroop is discovered sitting and reading. Lady Scroop enters, and after observing him some little time, approaches and addresses him. Lady S. Aye! there he sits—a melancholy man, feeding on what consumes him—I'll accost him—Sir Walter Scroop, Sir Walter Scroop, what are you about? Sir W. Reading my offices. Lady S. I would you were performing them. All, all is lost, and you sit reading—what will that do for you? Sir W. Teach me to bear my loss—but that is a lesson you won't let me learn—so farewell to my book! Now, Lady Scroop, what would you have me do? Lady S. Go to your castle, and convoke your people, to make a thorough search amongst the ruins. Good chance but something may be yet recover'd; and though 'twere little, where so much is lost that little will be welcome. Sir W. What can be lost when Adela is sav'd? Lady S. And whom have we to thank for that? Sir W. Heaven's providence. Lady S. Well, that is first of all; who can deny it? But when you are so thankful for her safety, can you forget the gallant youth, who risk'd his life to snatch her from the flames? Sir W. No! I do not forget that Adela was sav'd by Reginald. Lady S. Then why not give him what he sav'd? Sir W. Away! you are mad. Lady S. Give him but what his courage has preserv'd, his virtues merit, and his heart adores; and that is Adela. Sir W. And who is Adela? and who am I, to give the daughter of the Earl of Leicester to Reginald, an unknown, nameless foundling? my Lady Scroop, my Lady Scroop, let me hear no more of this, as you respect my honour, conscience, and my peace of mind. Lady S. Well! I have done. Sir W. See that you have; and never let that wish or pass your lips, or harbour in your heart, whilst you have life. Lady S. We'll drop the subject. Only be content. I do not wish to press into your secrets. Sir W. You know that Adela is Leicester's daughter; you know that nothing more is known of Reginald, but as the child of parents, who through shame or poverty expos'd him as a foundling, and threw him on my pity for support. What is there else to know? what other secrets have I conceal'd? Lady S. That is for you to answer, not for me. What secrets you entrust to me I keep, what you withhold I do not seek to know—Let that suffice—but look! here comes the good father Ambrose. I'll leave you with him. May his holy comfort lighten your heavy heart! [Exit Lady S. Friar Ambrose enters to Sir Walter. Sir W. Hail, father! Amb. Peace be with you!—Sir Walter Scroop, here is a holy man upon his pilgrimage, and late from France, who brings you tidings of the Earl of Leicester—He would be private with you. Sir W. Let him come. I am alone: no one shall interrupt us. [Exit Ambrose. Sir Walter Scroop alone. Tidings of Leicester! Ah, ill-fated Earl, Why, why art thou not here to save thy daughter, Whose heart unconscious feeds a hapless passion For Reginald—Oh horror—for the son Of her own mother. Heaven avert the crime Hateful to God and man! Ungrateful Queen, 'Tis in your cause the noble Leicester suffers; Oh, Richard, Cœur-de-lion truly nam'd, Why do you not restore your exil'd friend? But see, the pilgrim comes—Heaven's grace defend me, He comes in likeness of the Earl himself; His air, his step—'Tis he! my honour'd lord!— Enter of Leicester enters habited like a Pilgrim. Earl of L. Hah! is it so, my old and valued friend, Am I so little chang'd by ten years exile, That, soon as seen, I'm known, ev'n in this garb? Well, be it so! Justice at length relents, And Leicester soon will be himself again. But more of this hereafter—My fond heart, A father's heart, yearns to embrace my child. Sir W. You'll find her fair and good as she is lovely. Earl of L. I met her on my way. I found her fair, Blooming, and full of grace. I could not speak And she, who knew me only as a pilgrim, Turn'd, bow'd, and bade God bless me as I pass'd. The reverend father stood in mute amaze To see my bosom labour, and the tears Gush from my eyes, yet modestly forbore Enquiry of the cause; so on we pass'd To this umbrageous grove, where the cool breeze Hath fann'd my fainting spirits into life. Sir W. You met the Lady Adela, my lord? 'Twas not with my connivance she went forth. Was she alone, or how was she attended? Earl of L. Of her own sex attendant she had none; A youth, who on his mantle wore the cross, Walk'd by her side— Sir W. Oh, my thrice honour'd lord, For Heaven's sweet sake, command her to avoid That dangerous youth, ere love ensnares her heart; Chaste as the unsunn'd snow your daughter is, But Leicester's heiress must not so descend From her high privilege, to waste a thought On him, whose unknown parent, when she dropt Her infant at my door, gave him indeed The name of Reginald, but left his birth A secret wrapt in mystery and darkness. Earl of L. What you relate of this mysterious youth Is not entirely new; much I have heard, That does you honour, for the noble breeding Which you have giv'n him. I have heard withal That at the seige of Tours, this Reginald, Whom you have father'd, was the first to mount The desperate breach; for which heroic act Prince Richard knighted him upon the field. Sir W. Upon the very breach— Earl of L. And this brave Knight, Belov'd by Adela, by you approv'd, And for his valour honour'd by his King, Is your own son—Avow him, and receive My child, the dearest object of my love, And the best gift my friendship can bestow. Sir W. Not for ten thousand worlds—Forbid it, Heaven! Conscience, and truth, and nature, cry against it. By every blessed saint in Heav'n I swear He's not my son; if I should say he were, 'Twould be a perjury as deep as hell. Brave though he be and virtuous, (for I scorn To set him forth for other than he is) Sooner than give my sanction to that crime, This hand should lodge this dagger in my heart. Earl of L. Patience, good friend! you are by much too warm. Sir W. Can friendship be too warm? Till it be known What parents gave this nameless foundling birth, The Earl of Leicester cannot call him son. The kingly sword may with a touch confer A title on the merest son of earth, But true nobility is of itself, And holds its honours, not by grace or sufferance, But by inherent property and right. Earl of L. True, an appeal like this, when calmly urg'd, Weighs more with me than vehemence of words. Now, if you guess where these young lovers haunt, Conduct me thither. Sir W. This way we shall meet them. [Exeunt. Peter and Andrew enter. And. Come hither, Peter; did you note that stranger, who pass'd us but this minute with Sir Walter? Peter. Yes, he is a pilgrim. And. No more a pilgrim than yourself. I've said it. Peter. He is dress'd like a pilgrim. And. Pooh, how you babble! hold your tongue and listen. Which is the fitter person, do you think, to treat of matters secret and profound, I, or your silly self? Peter. You, master Andrew, you. Talk on, I pray you; I dearly love to hear you talk. And. Humph! I don't much dislike to hear myself. You must perceive there is a certain thing, which I possess in reasonable abundance, and you stand much in need of—I mean wisdom. Now there are three ways of acquiring wisdom: experience is the first—you have none of that: books are the next—but them you cannot read: the third and last, and best of all the three, is genius; of that, friend Peter, you have not one grain. How lucky then for you that I am here, to drop a little sense into your noddle! Peter. Pray, master Andrew, hav'nt you just now a drop or two in your own? And. No matter. Open both your ears, and edify. I told you that the stranger was no pilgrim; and why? because I knew him for the Earl of Leicester. Now there's a secret; see you keep it close. Peter. And why is it a secret? And. Hav'nt I said enough? Must I explain to you, that old King Henry banish'd the Earl of Leicester for good cause; and young King Richard, for no cause at all, unless it be to pillage his estates, keeps him in banishment? Now there you have it; and what are you the wiser for all this? Peter. Not much, in troth. 'Tis no concern of mine. And. There you are out. It is concern of your's, for you shall find the Earl will make short work with your Sir Reginald, and drive him out to those same holy wars, of which thou can'st discuss the why and wherefore, about as learnedly as thou can'st calculate eclipses, or chop logic. Peter. Well; I can fight; will not that serve? And. Yes, it will serve to prove thou art a dolt, to run thy head against a Saracen, and ask him civilly to knock thy brains out. Peter. But how if I knock his? And. He'll thank you for it; for then you waft him in a whiff to Paradise; you give him black-eyed girls, and beds of roses, where he quaffs coffee, that flows by in rivers, under the branches of pistachio trees. Peter. Ah, master, you're too eloquent for me; but this I know, if my young master, brave Sir Reginald, is to be turn'd adrift, there will be water shed by some bright eyes, that shall be nameless. And. Torrents of tears, and hurricanes of sighs: You may quote me for that. Bad times are coming on; sorrowful times. Peter. Oh lud, how I hate sorrow! 'Tis so dull; I never could abide it. And. No, nor will ever feel it. Now I hate sorrow too; but what do I? Ev'n what a wise man should—comfort myself, as you perceive, in time, that I may have wherewith to comfort others. Peter. Aye, you find all your comfort in the cellar. And. Well, and a blessing on his heart who built it! he must have known the worth of wine, who rear'd such sturdy arches to protect his liquor. Peter. You was there all the time the castle was on fire. And. Where could I be so well? I quench'd my thirst, and others burnt their fingers—Hold! who comes here? Sir Hugh de Lacy enters. Sir H. The good-day to you, worthy gentlemen! if you have knowledge of a certain knight, Sir Walter Scroop by name, I shall esteem it an act of courtesy to bring me to him. And. Puissant sir, I am the man to serve you, being familiar with the knightly person of Sir Walter Scroop, whereas this honest soldier only waits upon his horse. Sir H. Adjust your own precedencies, only be pleas'd to give me quick dispatch, as bearing from the Queen commands of no small moment. And. I am her highness's obsequious slave, and will incontinently give dispatch to you, being a man as loyally dispos'd, though I say it of myself, as any subject in the realm of England. Sir, I perceive you're for the holy wars; truly a most praise-worthy enterprize, for which his holiness the Pope will bless you, being a mortal foe to Mahomet, although himself a preacher up of peace. Sir H. At present, with your leave, we'll quit the Pope, and go in search of Sir Walter. And. This way, so please you. The grove is intricate; I'll be your guide.—Peter, you know your place. [Exeunt. Scene changes and discovers the Castle of Sir Walter Scroop in ruins, by fire. Adela is standing in a pensive posture, contemplating the ruins. The Earl of Leicester, preceded by Sir Walter Scroop, enters, and upon seeing his daughter stops short. Sir W. Lo, where your daughter stands. Earl of L. Hush, hush, be still. Adela advances towards the Castle, and kneels. Lady A. All gracious Providence, whose mercy sav'd me from these devouring flames, which, but for thy vouchsafement, and the courage of my deliverer, had amidst these ruins mingled my ashes, deign to accept my praises! and oh! whilst here thy rescued creature, kneeling, calls to mind the horrors of that moment, may I not, without offence, put up a prayer for him, who was thy timely messenger to save me? And, as it was the hand of Reginald that snatch'd me from these fires, so shall no other hand but his e'er lead me to thy sacred altar— Sir W. [advancing.] Stop!— Lady A. [rises and turns to Sir Walter.] Why should I stop? To him, and him alone, I plight my faith, and call on Heaven to register my vow. Sir W. Recall it! Supplicate to be absolv'd from that rash vow, and fall upon your knees once more to Heaven, or you are lost for ever. Lady A. I had been lost, inevitably lost, And left my reliques in that flaming mass, Had not the generous Reginald preserv'd me. This your own eyes beheld, your lips confess'd, Your conscience witnesses. What is my crime? If chaste affection, purity of heart, And the full sense of honour, be no crimes, How am I lost? Sir W. 'Tis not to me alone You vent these warm effusions. Be advis'd: Look round, examine before whom you speak, Ere you speak that, of which you may repent. Lady A. Your warning comes too late; you brought this stranger, A pilgrim, as it seems, unseen of me, To steal upon my privacy, and catch The secret aspirations of my soul, Whilst I pour'd forth my conscious vows to him, With whom alone its inmost thoughts repose. Was that fair dealing? Though disastrous times Made me your charge, and threw me on your care, I am the daughter of the Earl of Leicester: My noble father would not treat me thus. Sir W. You are the daughter of the Earl of Leicester— That is confest; but what is Reginald? Lady A. What is he? By his virtues more ennobled Than all, who, in themselves obscure and mean, Have nothing but an ancestry to boast of. He on the splendour of his own achievements Erects his title, in despight of birth; They wear their lazy honours by descent. Earl of L. Urge her no more—I know your father well, His thoughts are open to me as my own. Would you persist in what you now have vow'd, If he were present? Lady A. 'Tis a strong appeal To one, who would not grieve his wounded heart For the world's worth; yet could I not depart From what I've pledg'd in hearing of high Heaven, Though his thrice-honour'd person stood before me. Earl of L. Do you retain no memory of his person? Lady A. Alas, alas! when fortune tore him from me, So young was I, that in my mind I kept No register of forms, however dear. My father, from his country long estrang'd, Is lost to my remembrance. Earl of L. This will help it. [Produces a picture. Here is his portraiture—Not as he was, When in his happier days, but as he is; An exile, and a pilgrim, like to me. Take it; compare it! Lady A. Like to you—Oh Heaven!— If this be Leicester's likeness, you—oh you Are Leicester's self—You are my long-lost father— [She sinks gradually on her knee, as she speaks. Let me not kneel in error—Oh declare! Are you indeed my father? Earl of L. To my heart, My throbbing heart, I press thee; oh my child! I am, I am thy father— Sir W. Cease, my lord; Break off!—We are observ'd. [Sir Hugh de Lacy appears at the side scene, brought in by Andrew. They speak apart. And. There is Sir Wlater Scroop; you can't mistake him. He in the pilgrim's habit is no pilgrim; he is the banish'd Earl of Leicester; I tell you that, so it remains a secret. The lady is Adela de Bellamont, his daughter, a piece of rare humanity, worthy your notice—farewell! [Exit. Sir Hugh de Lacy advances. Sir H. Sir Walter Scroop, the Queen, our gracious regent, Sends you kind greeting; and whereas she holds Your faithful services in high regard, In her free bounty to repair the loss Of this fair castle, she bestows upon you Her house of Feversham to hold in fee, With all that it contains. Sir W. A princely boon, For which I do remain her humble beadsman, To the last hour of life. Sir H. I have besides, News not less welcome to your friendly ear For the brave Earl of Leicester—a full pardon, With restitution of his manors, rents, Castles, and royalties; to the extent Of all that he enjoy'd, when, in defence Of the attainted honour of the Queen, Enrag'd he drew his sword: for which the King, Our second Henry, banish'd and despoil'd him. If now he hears me, and in doubt conceals His noble person in the homely garb Of a poor pilgrim, he will cast it off, And let an old true friend, who shares his joy, Enfold him in his arms. Earl of L. Come to my heart! Thus, thus enfolded, Leicester lives again. Brave Knight, throughout all Christendom acknowledg'd Mirror of chivalry, behold I cast, At thy command, these pilgrim weeds away; And to my queen, the gracious Eleanor, Devote myself her ever-bounden knight: Again to draw my sword in her defence, If slander calls it forth, in her good cause Content to suffer banishment or death. Sir H. Then buckle on your armour, gallant lord, And join your peers at Vergelay, where France Holds friendly congress with our English king. There you shall find us; thither we are bound, And good Sir Walter Scroop must be content To part from Reginald. Sir W. Heav'n knows how gladly: Now, now I live again. [Aside. Sir H. His king expects The youthful hero, whom, from helm to spur All bath'd in gore, he knighted on the breach. The gallant Richard in the blood, that flow'd From his gash'd cuirass, dipt his sword, and drew Across his buckler thrice the streaming blade; Then bade him rise, Sir Reginald de Tours, And gave him licence evermore to wear That brave device emblazon'd on his shield. Lady A. Do you note that, my father? Sir H. Now to you, Most fair and noble lady, I am charg'd With a commission from our gracious Queen— A broider'd scarf, by her own fingers wrought, She sends by me, commanding you to invest With that her princely gift your own true knight; Who, when the savage flames embay'd you round, Bravely to save your life expos'd his own, As did your father his, when evil tongues, Than fire more fierce, conspir'd to blast her fame. Lady A. To the commands of my benignant Queen, Her humble handmaid, I profoundly bow. But if, when summon'd to invest her knight, My quivering nerves disgrace the awful task, Let this reflection mitigate my fault— The hands will tremble when the heart dissolves. Sir W. Enough!—and hark, the convent bell proclaims An hour past noon—[A distant clock strikes one.] Whilst, issuing from the gate, An armed warrior this way bends his steps. Sir H. 'Tis he; 'tis Reginald!—he turns aside; My soul's in arms to greet him—Let us follow! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Chamber. Sir Hugh de Lacy, and Reginald. Sir H. To part from those, who well deserve our love, Is no slight task, no trivial sacrifice; But we are soldiers, and when duty calls, All those fine chords, that twine about the heart, In honour's grasp are feeble as the threads, Which the light spider weaves upon the grass: Therefore, my hero, let us live to day As for ourselves, to-morrow for our fame. Sir R. Oh brave De Lacy, oh my more than father, To-morrow, and as many more to-morrows As in the book of fate are number'd out For my allotment, I devote as due To him, whose badge I wear, and to my King, Who bought me at a price so far beyond The measure of my worth; but as the soldier, Who never heard the trumpet sound to battle, At the first charge may tremble, even so, In love a novice, I approach the hour, That takes me hence, with terror and dismay. Sir H. Love is no hero's passion. Sir R. Virtuous love, And such is mine to Adela, inspires Virtuous ambition. Sir H. In the warrior's eye The fire should never languish; to his heart, Wrapt in its iron case, no fond desire, No soft unmanly passion should approach: The feeble darts that love's weak urchin throws, Pierce not that bosom from whose temper'd mail The blunted spear rebounds, and, if it pants, It pants for glory, or with anger swells. Sir R. Illustrious chief, I know it is not here, In Feversham's soft shades, that glory dwells, But in the dusty plains of Palestine, Where Saladin draws out his turban'd host. The soldier's music is the battle's shout, The clashing cymbal and the neighing steed; To see a wood of spears uprear'd in air, Their broad blades glittering in the golden sun, As they were tipt with fire; whilst over all The red-cross banner waves, and victory soars. If these are objects glorious in his eyes Who never lov'd, how must they fire my soul, Whose great ambition is to earn a name, That Leicester's daughter may not blush to share? Sir H. Leicester, indeed, might boast as high descent As any subject in our English realm; If Leicester, so illustrious in himself, For valour and for virtue so renown'd, Had need of such poor aids; but when you say Your great ambition is to earn a name, Have you forgot De Tours? Is that a name Which any noble maid might blush to share? Sir R. The hunter names his hounds, so may the King His soldiers: chance, that gave, may take away That fleeting favour, and the day may come, That some ignoble mother, when she sees Her beggar's brat a prosperous gentleman, May let her vanity outrun her shame, And claim me as her base-born progeny. Sir H. No, no, that claim will never rise to light; Seal'd to perpetual silence, it must sleep, Under the guard of honour. If the name Of her, who gave you being, were pronounc'd, The blood, that circles in your veins, would stop, And cause the pulses of your heart to cease With wonder and amaze. Sir R. I now perceive You, that have been the patron of my fame, My father let me call you, are possess'd Of the important secret, which to impart If prayers could move you, I would kneel to know. Look at this cross! the symbol of my faith, Is this dishonour's badge? Why am I held Worthy to wear it; if unworthy deem'd To hold in trust a circumstance, on which My every hope of happiness, perhaps The very safety of my soul depends? Sir H. Urge me no more; nor time nor place accord, Nor is thy heart prepar'd to entertain The awful wonder, till, at distance thrown From all that here surround us, seas shall roll, And mountains rise, and nations intervene 'Twixt thee and Adela; then, as we pace The sacred soil, which our Redeemer trod, I will unfold: 'Till then forbear thy suit, Avoid conjecture, 'twill destroy thy peace; And above all, beware Sir Walter Scroop! [Exit. Sir R. How awfully those warning words confirm What Nature hath impress'd upon my heart— Beware Sir Walter Scroop—And see, he comes! Sir Walter and Lady Scroop enter. Sir W. My son, since all-disposing fate ordains That we must part, my consolation is, Your virtues have repaid me all the cares That your whole life hath cost me: you go forth Grac'd with the royal favour of your Queen, Nobly appointed in a cause as noble. New scenes of glory wait you in the East, Where the prime spirits of the Christian world With rival zeal will wage their holy war. Lady S. Can any war be holy? Men may wage war for plunder, for revenge, For their ambition; but to fight for Him, Who fought not for himself, to my humble reason Cannot be reconcil'd. Sir R. Had Heav'n endow'd Its creatures with benevolence like your's, War never had been known; the sword had slept. But if God gives me victory in the battle, For your dear sake I will remember mercy, And spare my fallen foe. So, when withdrawn, Perhaps for ever, to far distant climes, I still shall keep your image in my sight, Still lay your bright example to my heart, And profit by the lessons you have taught. Lady S. Child of my love, my pray'rs shall tell to Heaven What my tongue dare not, what it cannot speak. Go, and if just the cause in which you fight, Conquest will follow your triumphant arms; But if the fathers of the Church mistake The peaceful spirit of our meek religion, And draw the sword to slaughter guiltless men, Whose only error springs from education, Vain will be all your efforts. But I've done— 'Tis not a woman's province to discuss Questions of this high import. Sir W. Truly said. So, even so, my good old mother talk'd, When for the first time I went forth to battle; And mothers so will talk to the world's end; Yet nations will fall out, and men will fight, In spite of all that peacemakers can say. A Messenger enters. Mess. Sir Knight, you are expected at the convent: The Earl of Leicester waits. Sir R. I shall attend. [Exit Messenger. To both my generous friends at once—farewell! I now anticipate that painful word, Lest, when to-morrow comes, and brave De Lacy Points to the harbour, where our galley rides, My tongue should fail me, and the fervent thanks, Which my full heart conceives, die on my lips. [Exit. Sir Walter and Lady Scroop. Sir W. Weep not, my gentle Margaret; dry your tears! For mark how happy fortune smiles upon us. Thanks to the bounty of our Queen, we change A ruin'd castle for a royal palace. To-morrow Reginald embarks for France; To-morrow we to Feversham repair, Therefore farewell to all my cares to-morrow. I keep it as a double holiday, A day the whitest in the calendar. Lady S. So you are happy, I shall be content. Sir W. I know your goodness, and severely feel My temper's past defects. Oh, 'twas unkind, It was inhuman, with remorse I own it, To hurt a heart so tender and so true. Why did I not confide to you the secret, That sour'd my nature, and destroy'd my peace? Lady S. Ah, why indeed? I am your wife, and scorn To be the base betrayer of your trust. Sir W. Then hear my story, and let that atone— You may remember, more than twenty years Have pass'd, since Henry, in despite of Rome, Drove the arch-prelate Becket from his see: 'Twas then the Earl of Leicester was dispatch'd To calm the angry Pontiff—hard the task, And twelve long months of absence had elaps'd, Whilst here at Feversham his countess liv'd In solitude with the neglected Queen, Our royal Eleanor— Lady S. I well remember, Whilst faithless Henry haunted Woodstock bower, His slighted consort pass'd the dreary time Unnotic'd and forlorn. Sir W. It was the hour Of midnight, when a summons from the palace Rous'd me from sleep; I follow'd my conductress, Who led me to the chamber of a lady, Within whose arms a smiling cherub lay: 'Twas Leicester's consort, and her new-born babe, Our darling Reginald— Lady S. Oh, horror, horror! Brother of Adela—Unhappy son Of her, whom living we esteem'd a saint, Whom Leicester follow'd to the grave with tears And sighs, that melted the beholders hearts. But say, what further evidence of guilt?— Did she confess it? Sir W. Hear the rest, and judge.— Languid and faint, with trembling voice she said— “If ever pity touch'd your manly heart, As a true knight, I do conjure you take This helpless innocent, protect his life, And save a wretched mother from disgrace!” What need of words? I took the lovely babe, Bound to concealment, rear'd him as you know, And never hath the secret pass'd my lips, Till now that in your bosom I repose it. Lady S. This could not be a secret from the Queen, For they were fast and undivided friends. Sir W. Right sure she knows it, and I put the favours Now shower'd on us to Reginald's account. Lady S. So it should seem, and yet 'tis somewhat strange The Queen should be so lenient to a crime, And so indignant of the imputation, When pointed at herself—One question more— Who is the father? Sir W. That eludes conjecture: There I am wholly lost. Lady S. Turn, turn the hearts Of these unconscious lovers, gracious Heaven! Now bear him hence, ye waves! waft him, ye winds, Till on the shores of Palestine he lands, There in the blood of infidels to quench The incestuous flame, that demons, who delight In Virtue's fall, have kindled in his breast. Sir W. Enough! 'tis done. To-morrow he departs. Retire, my love, and calm your troubled thoughts. [Exeunt. Scene changes to a Hall in the Convent of Feversham. The Earl of Leicester alone. Ye sacred walls, by my forefathers rear'd In the first William's day, with filial awe Once more I visit you. Amongst their tombs Silent I walk, as fearing to offend With my rude steps their venerable shades. Ambrose enters with Adela. Amb. Illustrious patron of our ancient house, Behold this noble maid, whose inmost thoughts I've search'd, and find them pure, though sorely rent With agony for loss of him she loves. You were a husband once, your heart hath felt Those strong affections, which, if rudely cross'd, Bear down the soul with overwhelming woe, Ev'n to the loss of reason, you can judge With candour, you with mercy can decide. Her conscience is my charge, her choice is yours. [Exit. Leicester and Adela. Earl of L. Come hither, Adela! that holy man Speaks as he feels, but he is not a father. To him the world is nothing; names, degrees, And titles, are but feathers in his scale; Virtue alone he weighs— Lady A. What else is worthy? Earl of L. Beware, my child, how you indulge such thoughts, As bear a show of metaphysic truth, But, when applied to practice, mock your reason. We, that are call'd to fill distinguish'd parts On the world's stage, must so deport ourselves As not to languish in the world's esteem. You are my only stay: on you devolves The fortune of my house: you have a name; What name hath Reginald? Lady A. De Tours. A name Above all names, ennobled by his king, Earn'd by his sword, emblazon'd in his blood, And written on his shield in characters So legible, that all the world may read. Earl of L. True; these are honours that his valour won, And worthily he wears. These you record In glowing language; why not add to these The royal trophy by De Lacy brought, The scarf, by which you must prepare to deck The knight, whom kings applaud and queens adorn? With all these honours grac'd, let him go forth, Let Palestine be sav'd, and he is yours. Lady A. Ere Palestine is sav'd, I shall be lost. Earl of L. Your mother was as precious to my sight As Reginald to yours, yet at the call Of honour, I left all my heart held dear. Lady A. You did, my father; but you carried with you The consciousness of having left to chance No power to cancel that heart-binding bond, Which holy church had seal'd. Earl of L. She lov'd my fame; She was Lord Pembroke's daughter, nobly born. Lady A. And yet you lov'd her from a nobler motive— Her virtues and endowments. Earl of L. Ah my child, Now as I turn my tearful eyes upon thee, Methinks I see her. Lady A. Would to Heaven you did! Her gentle shade would plead with such a look Of soft seraphic pity, you would melt, And own that he alone, who sav'd the life Of your poor Adela, deserves her love. Reginald enters to them. Earl of L. Welcome, brave Reginald! at length we meet, And face to face I see the valiant knight, Who to his followers, in the breach at Tours, Trac'd out the road to conquest in his blood. Sir R. Praise from the man, who is himself adorn'd With glory's brightest wreath, is praise indeed. Earl of L. I hear the King has called a gallant band Of chosen knights, to be his body's guard, And fellows in the field. Sir R. I hear the same. Earl of L. I'm told withal that you are nam'd as one In this heroic list, and that the scarf By the queen-mother sent you, is the badge Of your election. Sir R. When that sacred scarf, Is wrapt around me by an angel's hand, If my heart so enfolded, does not feel A hero's fire, I must be less than man. Earl of L. Go then, and tear the charmed standard down Of haughty Saladin; go, make his moons Stoop in the dust before the conqu'ring cross. Like a true knight, in danger's front oppose Your new-emblazon'd shield before the breast Of your brave King; while infidels, who dream The gates of Paradise are opening to them, Infuriate rush to meet predestin'd death. Then come with all your laurels blooming fresh, And by the honour that is in me—Hah! Ambrose the Monk enters. We are prevented— Lady A. No—upon my knees I do implore you, fill the sentence up, Complete the promise; let not honour's name Be pledg'd, to vanish like an idle word; But, in the hearing of this holy man, Oh, speak your purpose, speak! Amb. If I offend, Let me depart. Lady A. No, no, you can't offend. My father is not angry; he is kind, Generous, and full of pity— Earl of L. Cease, my child; Give me your hand—And now, if Reginald, With heart affianc'd to this noble maid, Upon the faith of a true knight, will swear To do her loyal service in the wars, Keeping his honour pure, his love entire, And so returning shall demand her hand In holy wedlock, solemnly I pledge My sacred word, on him I will bestow her. The word has pass'd; the holy man has heard it; Now let him witness and record my vow. Sir R. Oh, lead me to the altar; let me swear In hearing of high Heaven— Amb. Be patient, son! The church is occupied, the choir attends To chant their office as the form directs, Whilst Adela invests you with the scarf, Thereto deputed by the royal sender. Lady A. Ah, cruel father, why with this delay Torture my throbbing heart? Why interpose To dash my hope, just springing to the birth? Take me, oh take me to some darkling cell, There in conventual-gloom let me abide, Till light and life and Reginald return. Earl of L. No, Adela, the father counsels well. 'Twere fit that vows so solemn should be pledg'd Before the altar; first array your knight With all the forms that chivalry prescribes; Then, by the hand of his dear mistress deckt With honour's brightest trophy, let him kiss The sacred shrine, and with the double tie Of love and of religion bind his oath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Sir Walter and Lady Scroop. Lady S. Certain it is he has pledg'd himself to Reginald to give him Adela to wife, when he returns from Palestine, and the war shall be over. Sir W. Who tells you this? Lady S. Adela herself. Sir W. Well, let that pass. So long as the Earl of Leicester confines himself to promises, I shall be silent. Nothing short of the last necessity, nothing less than the irresistible call upon my conscience to prevent the horror of an incestuous marriage, shall force the secret from me. I have had dispatches from the Queen within this hour. Lady S. I understand a courier has been with you. Sir W. Yes, and with fresh injunctions to observe the strictest secrecy from all the parties, she adds fresh bounties to ensure my silence. She graciously informs me, it is in contemplation to create me Lord Scroop of Feversham, in consideration of my loyalty, and the care I have bestow'd upon the education of Reginald; and to this she subjoins, that “whatever may be my conjectures as to the authors of his birth, let them on no account transpire, as I regard her favour.” Lady S. There is a mystery in all her Majesty's proceedings with respect to Reginald, that I cannot fathom. The eagerness with which she recommends this marriage, is what I cannot find a motive for. Sir W. I only know what motives govern me; of her's I cannot judge. Promises, such as Leicester has referr'd to the termination of the war, will not force me upon discovery; but, if melted by the entreaties of his daughter, dazzled by the graces of Reginald, or deluded by the sophistry of Father Ambrose, he should desperately attempt to join their hands in holy wedlock; I will rescue the altar from prophanation, and my own conscience from responsibility, at whatever peril. Lady S. To execute that duty faithfully, you must closely watch the motions of the monk; I know how much he has at heart the consummation of this dreadful match. Adela has access to him on the plea of confession at all hours; Reginald has been lodg'd in the convent, ever since we were reduc'd to take refuge in this small habitation. Recollect that Adela is to give the scarf to her knight this very evening—a dangerous ceremony. What could possess the Queen to impose that upon a sister, which is only the office of a mistress to her lover? Sir W. That is with the queen to answer— Andrew enters, followed by Peter. Sir W. How now, Andrew! why this interruption? And. So please you, Sir Walter, this poor fellow, Peter by name, son of your old servant Deborah, who acts as dry nurse to your hens and chickens, has conceiv'd a most pious inclination for the holy wars, and hopes you will be pleas'd to dispense with his vassalage, and favour him with a discharge. Peter, stand forward and make your bow. Sir W. I recollect him now about the castle. Peter. Yes, I have been about the castle, man and boy, ever since I was born. Lady S. And what has put it into your head, Peter, to turn soldier? And. Ever since he notic'd a Saracen's head upon a sign-post he has been seiz'd with a most inveterate resolution to drive them out of Palestine. Peter. Yes, I should like to drive them out, and list myself under Sir Reginald. I'll fight for him whilst I have breath in my body. Sir W. Make out his discharge, and give him a noble in his pocket to drink the health of his brave commander. And. Oh lord, sir, give him nothing to drink. Peter is an honest fellow, and knows by experience that honesty is its own reward. He is quite satisfied of that, having had the honour of working for you, without pay, these many years past. Sir W. Do as you are order'd, and let me not be troubled with your foolish comments.—Come, Lady Scroop; we have business of another sort. [Exeunt Sir Walter and Lady Scroop. Manent Andrew and Peter. Peter. Master Andrew, a word with you, under favour. And. Say on, my lad of valour; speak thy mind, thou terrible antagonist of the Sultan Saladin. Peter. Aye, there you've hit upon it; that's the pinch. I would fain know the right of it, that I may have wherewith to talk a bit to mother, who is cruelly set against that Holy Land. And. Out upon her, foolish woman, she little knows what comforts wait you in that charming country. Peter. I pray you let me know of what sort they are, for I dearly love to have my comforts about me. You have been amongst those same Saracens, master Andrew, and have the gift of describing; I beseech you, make me a little acquainted with them. And. Oh, as for that, you'll soon get acquainted with them, friend Peter; they are not at all ceremonious; they have a familiar way of saluting you with their battle-axes, and few Christian sculls are obdurate enough to stand out against them. Peter. If that be all, let 'em come on. I can handle the battle-axe perhaps as well as they can. And. They have also a way of handling the sabre, which chops off the head at a stroke. When that happens, the man who has lost his head, seldom makes any use of his body afterwards. Peter. No, he dies, we'll suppose. Well, be it so: a man can die but once, that's my comfort. And. If a Saracen takes you prisoner, he will allow you the honour of making your public entry, sitting upon the back of a scurvy ass, with your face towards the crupper, and your ignoble parts towards Mecca; in this posture he will entertain you with a flogging, during which you cut capers, to the infinite recreation of all true believers in their false prophet. Peter. Let 'em flog; let 'em flay me; they can do no more, and I dare say I can bear it. When I run, they are welcome to catch me; whilst I stand still, they shall not have me for a little—so no more of that. Whilst we fare well, our hearts won't fail, and soldiers make their quarters good: please God and the king, we shall live upon the fat of the land. And. Yes, upon fat crows, and fat kites; you will live sumptuously upon rats and mice; dine deliciously upon frogs and newts, and rotten biscuit, that the weevils have mumbled into dust, with water soup out of the ditches, to wash it down, and pig-nuts for a desert, if you have the luck to find 'em. Peter. Never fear me; I am one of those that love to live well, but, if provisions run short, there is nothing like content. And. Then for lodging; you have the earth for your bed, a stone for your pillow, and the sand for your coverlid. Peter. And that is altogether as good as a blanket; so I shall lie warm at least, which is a luxury I delight in; so now, master Andrew, I thank you heartily for your good news, and if you have any commands where I am going, let me know 'em, for I shall be off to-morrow. Now let us look out for the Saracen's head, take a parting flaggon to our next merry meeting, and keep it up till we have turn'd our noble into nine-pence. And. Well said, my honest fellow; thou hast the spirit of a true man of Kent, and let Saladin and his Saracens look to it. Come on! [Exeunt arm in arm. Scene changes to the Convent. Sir Hugh de Lacy and Ambrose the Monk. Sir H. Father, we know what care you have bestow'd On our young hero, Reginal de Tours, From infancy to manhood, training on His ductile mind to Virtue's full expanse. Nor I, alone, who love him as a son, But Eleanor, our gracious Queen, has kept A faithful register of your deservings, Which will not pass without their due reward. Amb. They are rewarded, sir, when nam'd by you; They also are repaid by the delight, With which I see my pupil rise to fame, Right nobly won and royally bestow'd: But when you tell me that my gracious Queen Deigns to remember me, a poor recluse, That has renounc'd the world, and by the world Conceives himself forgotten, I must wonder, That midst so many great and public cares, Object so mean can occupy a thought. Sir H. You must not say you have renounc'd the world, Whilst it has claims upon you. You have made Your pupil virtuous, you must make him happy. Amb. Oh that I could! behold me grey with years: What is my life, unless I live for him? Why beats this heart, why toils this aching brain, But for his sake? I am a man of peace, And boasting ill becomes an humble monk; But, in the cause of that beloved youth, Place me in danger's front, I'll not go back. Sir H. Do you not see how ardently he loves The peerless daughter of the Earl of Leicester? Did he not snatch her from the blazing ruins Of yonder castle? does he not deserve her? Amb. He does deserve her, and she meets his love. Sir H. Who then forbids their union? does the pride Of Leicester rouse at his mysterious birth? Amb. The Earl of Leicester, with a noble candour, Has promis'd him his daughter, when the war, In Palestine now kindled, shall be quench'd. Sir H. But who can promise when that time shall be? None but the great Disposer of events. Torrents of Christian blood shall first be spilt, Ere that fierce conflagration shall be quench'd. I know the power of Saladin how vast; Though all the kings of Europe shall combine To shake his mighty empire, their own thrones Shall be the first to tremble with the shock. Where is the period then of war like this, And what is happiness delay'd but pain? Why does not Leicester join their hands this night? Amb. That is at once my council and my wish. Sir H. Then might the wedded Adela embark With other noble matrons for Messina, Where Richard's fleet and army will repose Till the confederates shall collect their force. Amb. Propose the marriage then; who like yourself, With influence only second to the Queen's, Can so persuade; or, if occasion need, Who with such high authority control? Sir H. If then the Queen through me should speak the word, Would you obey it? Amb. I could not refuse, Knowing the honour of Sir Hugh de Lacy. Sir H. But if herself should speak— Amb. Behold me ready! Sir H. Be ready then—for in this scroll she speaks. Take it, peruse it; 'tis address'd to you; By her own hand 'tis written; on the wax Her royal seal is stampt—And know withal, When the contents are satisfied, I hail you Abbot of Tewkesbury, and mitred lord. [Exit. Ambrose alone. Abbot of Tewkesbury!—a princely boon, And doubly grateful as my native spot. But on what terms? A Queen not over chaste, A lady once divorc'd and twice arraign'd, May dictate terms to make my conscience start, My holy function blush—Why then at once, Guilty ambition, hence!—Now to the test— [Opens the packet and reads. “To the Right Holy Father Ambrose of Tewkesbury, greeting— “When this shall be delivered to you by my faithful servant, Sir Hugh de Lacy, let it be your warrant forthwith to join the hands of Reginald de Tours, my knight at arms, and Adela de Bellamont, my well-belov'd, in holy wedlock, without let or gainsay, such being my pleasure, and their lawful inclinations. If Leicester, who owes me for no less than life and fortune, becomes contentious upon the matter of Reginald's mysterious birth, so as to be no otherwise appeas'd, deliver to him in secrecy the letter herein enclos'd; if not, forbear, as you respect my favour, to violate the seal— Your's, in all honourable service, ELEANOR, Regent.” It shall be so! I spy no flaw in this, No just impediment, that should arrest The consecration of their mutual love. Reginald enters. How now, my son! why that disorder'd brow? Sir R. As I was passing hither, in the cloister I met Sir Walter Scroop. He seiz'd my hand, And bade me stop: silent awhile he stood, And gaz'd upon me; then, as one surpriz'd By sudden transport, threw his arms around me, And press'd me to his heart. At length he cried— Let me not seem unkind, when I confess, Such are the terrors that alarm my soul For one so justly dear, so truly good, That I shall bless the hour that takes you hence. Amb. His reason wanders; many a time he has talk'd In the same strain to me. Did you reply? Sir R. I simply ask'd him to disclose the cause, That so disturb'd his peace. Amb. 'Tis all in vain. I've made the same enquiry o'er and o'er, It only feeds his phrenzy. Sir R. So it seem'd; For on my question, with disorder'd look, He wildly answer'd—Would I know the cause That rais'd the storm of passions in his heart, I must betake me to the silent vault Where sleeps the wife of Leicester, and invoke Her spirit to awake and find a voice. This said, an instant horror seem'd to strike His trembling frame; he started, and was gone. Amb. Let this suffice. You need no other proof. I saw him when his castle was on fire: Congeal'd with horror and amaze he stood, And in those moments, whilst you rush'd through flames To save the dying Adela, despair, That fixt him motionless, had seiz'd his brain; And now, when fearful recollection strikes His shatter'd senses, he conceals himself Amongst the tombs, and communes with the dead Therefore it is he raves of Leicester's wife; For there he mostly haunts. Sir R. I think, indeed, It is the horror of that dismal night That has derang'd his mind; for sure till then A kinder gentleman there did not live, To me at least the best and warmest friend; But now how chang'd, how sullen and morose To all around him! Most of all to me; For now, when even Leicester smiles upon me, He, still professing friendship, still opposes All that my most inveterate foe could urge To thwart my hopes of Adela. Amb. Your hopes Shall become certainties this very night. Sir R. Father, what mean you? Amb. To obey the voice Of Nature, and to circumvent the plots, That now are hatching to defeat those hopes, Which, built on promises, are built on air. But Heav'n, whilst I keep guard upon its altar, Shall not be mock'd by promises, or plots, Man's weak devices—Adela, come forth!— Sir R. Hah, Adela! Amb. Be calm! and see, she comes. Adela enters. Lady A. Father, what cause so urgent?—Gracious Heaven, Is it for him, for him that I am summon'd? What has befallen him? Oh, quickly speak! Amb. Be not alarm'd—Sir Reginald de Tours, By that heroic title, greater far Than any from inheritance deriv'd, By the resplendent trophies that you wear On your emblazon'd shield, and, more than all, By that your sacred Cross I do adjure you, Look on this noble maiden; and declare If in true faith and purity of soul, By chaste and holy love alone inspir'd, You have assail'd and won her virgin heart. Sir R. Need I reply? To Heav'n and you are known Each secret thought within my heart conceiv'd; And, as I've lodg'd her heav'nly image there, What foulness can inhabit where she dwells? Amb. Enough! now hear me.—Holy Church, whose rites My part is to administer, in me Speaks; and by me consents to join your hands In the pure bond of wedlock. Let not doubt Perplex your minds: upon myself I take The peril of the act. This night you wed, This hour, this instant— [A short but solemn strain is heard as at a distance. But I'm summon'd. Hark! They have begun to celebrate their mass For Leicester's safe return. That service past, Come to the private chapel, and be secret. [Exit. Reginald and Adela. Sir R. My Adela, my soul's supreme delight, How I respect thee, honour and adore thee, Words are too weak to tell. Thou'st heard the monk; A man too wise to sport with idle words, Too just to deal in fallacies and plots, Yet I conjure thee weigh what he proposes With what thy father promis'd, and decide As fits the dignity of Leicester's daughter. Lady A. What is my father's promise? Can I weigh A vapour, a deceitful, distant spark, Glimmering, but not with hope; a treacherous light, That only serves to lure me to my grave? If in my father's promise I confide, To-morrow we must part; you to the east, Where every morning's sun will rise in blood; I to a convent's solitary gloom, Nightly to wander by the moon's pale beam Midst hollow vaults, that echo to my groans, Till melancholy and despair shall end me. Sir R. Then let the holy father join our hands And honour's plea stand by till love be heard. Then shall my wedded Adela ascend The vessel, that transports her husband hence; And noble Leicester, when upon our knees Suppliant we fall, and with our mingling tears Bathe his paternal feet, shall feel his heart Melt to forgiveness, and confess thy life Was worth preserving, though with honour's loss Lady A. He is a hero; he has been a husband We shall not part unblest; he will forgive us: By his own sufferings taught, he knows to feel When others suffer. I have pray'd for mercy; Before the shrine of my protecting saint I sent up my petition, when the voice Of the good Ambrose rais'd me from my knees. That mercy I had ask'd of Heav'n, through him, My earthly saint, descending, was transfus'd, And reach'd me in the hour of my affliction. Sir R. Prepare to meet him then—for, hark! he comes— Sir Walter Scroop enters. Sir Walter Scroop!— Sir W. Unwelcome though I am, Once more I seek you— Sir R. You have found me, sir. Sir W. I have; and still shall haunt you, still shall walk My ghostly rounds within these hallow'd walls, At once to guard the living and the dead From the unseen destruction, that will burst Like thunder, if, though warn'd, you still persist To feed and cherish a forbidden flame. Sir R. Sir Walter, with some trouble I forbear To notice your intrusion as I might, Were not my anger temper'd by compassion For the sad state to which your mind, of late So luminously furnish'd, is reduc'd. But tempt me not. I am no more than man, And these are dangerous trials. Sir W. Threaten not; For that is insult, which I never answer But with defiance and contempt. Behold! Here is my bosom—strike! Lady A. Forbid it, Heaven! My generous, kind protector, fear him not: He would not harm you for the worth of worlds. Cover that honour'd bosom. Let me breathe My peace into it; oh! let me allay The storm that ruffles it, and thus protect Him, whose unwearied care protected me. Sir W. Angelic innocence, sweet pitying saint, For your compassion, thanks. But let him strike; Let his sword pierce my heart! It will be mercy, For then thou wilt not, can'st not take a hand Dipt in my blood, but must abhor the monster, Who stabb'd his benefactor in revenge For his too anxious effort to preserve him. Sir R. You give too hard a name to my offence. I never struck an enemy unarm'd, How should I stab a friend? within this hour Twice you have come upon me by surprise. Your talk has been mysterious, wild, abrupt; No argument, nor method of discourse. And now you break into those sacred moments, Too few to waste, too precious to be lost. If aught is doing that you wish undone, Or aught neglected you would have me do, Speak your full mind; discharge your troubled thoughts, And be yourself again. Sir W. Lo, I am calm; And now, the whilst our noble Leicester makes His votive offerings at Saint George's shrine, If my sweet Adela will recollect There is a poor deserted thing at home, Who nurs'd her as a mother, and now longs To embrace her darling, I should fondly hope She will not think the minutes much mispent, Which she devotes to one, who dearly loves her. Lady A. Your gentle lady merits all my love, And all my gratitude: with every wish, That she conceives, my duty shall comply. Proceed! I follow—Reginald, remember! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. A Sacristy, or Chapel, in the Convent of Feversham. Leicester enters. Once more I've visited the house of death, Where sleep the ancient fathers of my race, Patriots and heroes great in peace and war. There, o'er the tomb of the departed chief, The plumed casque that brac'd his conqu'ring brow, And time-worn banner, once so proudly borne, (Their tatter'd remnants now with dust besprent) Serve but to shew how death's terrific power Mocks at our frail memorials. Oh, thou King! The last which Time shall conquer, why so awful Here in thy dark domain, where silence reigns, When in the battle's din I've heard thy screams Rending the air, and fac'd thee undismay'd? As I pass'd onwards through the vaulted aisles, A chilly horror seiz'd on all my frame; Cold damps bedew'd my brow: methought I felt The marble pavement, upon which I stood, Tremble beneath my feet. I look'd, and lo! I was then treading on the very stone, That cover'd the remains of my dead wife. Oh horror, horror! her beloved name Was trampled by my sacrilegious feet. Instant I knelt, I sunk upon the spot, I hid my face between my hands, my tears Water'd the pavement, my whole heart dissolv'd In agonizing woe— Ambrose the Monk appears. Earl of L. How now! why this? Who and whence art thou? Amb. My thrice-honour'd lord, The brethren of the convent have perform'd Their solemn service for your blest return. Earl of L. Where are your masses for her soul, who was The very soul, that gave this body life, And dying carried with her all its joys? Why have you buried her in silent earth? Where is the epitaph, that speaks her praise And my affliction? Where the stately tomb, Around whose sculptur'd sides, angels attend With wings outspread to waft her soul to bliss? Is this your care for the lamented wife Of him, who, though in exile, would have risk'd The forfeit of his life to close her eyes, Had not Death struck her with so swift an arrow, That, ere I knew the danger, all was lost? Amb. My lord, your humble beadsmen have not ceas'd To chaunt their requiems o'er your lady's grave; Nor have they scrupled, from their public stock, To rear a costly cœnotaph, the which, Far in advance, but waits the master's hand To perfect its adornments, and record To all posterity the honour'd name Of Leicester's consort, noble Pembroke's daughter. Earl of L. In honouring her they take the surest course To bind me to their service, and I blush For my unjust complaint. It now remains To ask their gracious leave for the investment Of our young Knight, within these sacred walls, In form and order, as may best become The wearer and the donor of the scarf. Amb. The holy brotherhood are all prepar'd To give the ceremony such display As may evince their duty to the Queen, And grace the hero, destin'd to obtain The beauteous hand that decks him for the fight. Earl of L. You were his teacher, you array'd his mind In that rich clothing, which so far outshines The borrow'd splendour of exterior show. But zeal for those we love sometimes regards The claims of others with too little care; And friendship cunningly inclines the beam, Whilst hood-wink'd justice cannot spy the fraud. Now tell me, if you were as much my friend As you are his, would you not pause in doubt Upon the measure, which you now promote? Would you, as counsel to the Earl of Leicester, Advise him to bestow his only child, The heiress of his honours, on that youth Mysterious and unknown? Nay, let me add, Denounc'd by Scroop in such emphatic terms, As seem to indicate a conscious dread Of some tremendous secret unreveal'd. Amb. To these in order—I admit my zeal In its full force, but I deny its power To warp my mind against the truth and you. For Reginald, I hold him so ennobled In his own virtue, that I know no name Or title, which, although by birth obscure, He by his character would not exalt; Therefore I hold him worthy to obtain That hand in marriage, which your promise gives. As for Sir Walter Scroop and his protest, I think him either wandering in his reason, Or dark in his designs, and what is dark I've rarely fail'd to find is foul withal. If he knows aught, that should forbid the marriage, Why does he hide it; if not, wherefore hint it? Earl of L. You've said it, and I close with your reply; Determin'd that if Reginald returns From Palestine, his honour unimpeach'd, He weds my daughter. Amb. Bear with me awhile— Have you consider'd how, by this delay, You risque the health, the happiness, the life Of your beloved daughter? Earl of L. Hah! the life?— Amb. Hear me with patience!—I did say the life; And, knowing all the force of her affection, I do repeat, and seriously affirm My full conviction, that I've us'd no word Too strong for the occasion. Earl of L. That she loves him I cannot doubt. Amb. Her's is no common love, Be sure of that; no momentary passion. The blood of Leicester and of Pembroke glows In her high-swelling heart, and ere it bends To the strong gust of sorrow, it will break. But see! they come—I could have spar'd them now. [Aside. Reginald and Adela enter. Lady A. My father here! We are betray'd, my Reginald. The monk, the monk, has fail'd us. [Apart. Sir R. Be compos'd!— Illustrious lord, we are not unprepar'd For this encounter, nor have far to seek For him, whom we must thank for the occasion. As for myself, my course of life is known; But where to search for those, who gave me life, If there be one that knows, I am not he. Lost to all filial feelings, nature still Speaks in my heart, alive to all the claims That man is heir to: beauty charms my sight, Virtue my soul; but when they both unite In this fair creature, should I be a man, If I did not confess and feel their power? This is at once my crime and my defence. Conscious of my obscurity, I strive, I struggle with my passion, but in vain; Destin'd at once to love and to despair. Earl of L. Now, daughter, on your part pursue the strain Of fair confession. I am turn'd to hear. Lady A. My part is easy, for my plea is short. As by his courage I was sav'd from death, So, if bereft of him, it had been well That I had died at once, nor been reserv'd For torments worse than those which I escap'd. Earl of L. But you agnize in me a father's right To guide your judgment, and approve your choice. Lady A. When banishment bereft me of your care, I was an orphan with a living father: My mother too was lost; Heav'n claim'd its saint, And took her up from this bad world to bliss. The Lady Scroop (may blessings light upon her!) Was kind and tender—She was humble also; She taught me where to place my just regards, And virtue for its own sake how to prize. Then, then it was this noble hero came, With all his laurels clustering on his brow, And, with the love of glory at my heart, (To which, as Leicester's daughter, I was born,) I gave that heart to him, who, if the world Had been the prize for valour, would have won it. Earl of L. And he shall win fresh laurels to adorn The nuptial couch, that waits his glad return. Sir R. Here I must claim your patience, and demand Of that good father if he has divulg'd The secret purpose that has brought us hither. Amb. No, no, my son. Where would your question point? Sir R. To that tribunal, which in every heart Conscience erects, and at whose bar arraigns The meditation of each guilty thought. My lord, I have no claim upon your promise, For I came hither to espouse your daughter, Thereto encourag'd by this pious man. He'll not deny it. Amb. No; I meet the charge, And trust the motive justifies the deed. Earl of L. Can any motive justify a fraud? Amb. Was it in Reginald a fraud to save Your daughter from the flames? By the like fraud I purpos'd to preserve and bless her life. If nothing but your promise were oppos'd 'Twixt life and death, death would have been her lot. I search'd her heart, was inmost with her thoughts; You only scann'd her with a stranger's eye. If more there needs for my defence, the Queen Stands in the peril, and avows the fraud, If such it can be call'd when own'd by her. Earl of L. Have you the proof of this? Amb. I have the proof Imperative, by noble Lacy vouch'd. Earl of L. If this Sir Hugh de Lacy shall attest, And the Queen wills it so, so let it be! I am content: in me is no delay. But first in order let the fair betroth'd Fulfil the royal mandate, and array Her Knight, or e'er she weds him. That perform'd, Prepare the altar; let the rites proceed. [Exit. Sir R. Now, Adela, with honour unimpeach'd, And a clear conscience, I embrace my blessing. Lady A. Thus twice by Heav'n and you preserv'd, I claim The right, which other loyal wives enjoy, To share the voyage with my wedded knight. Sir R. Father, your pardon! I confess I wrong'd you, When, on the sight of Leicester, I believ'd You had disclos'd the purpose of our meeting. Amb. No more of that: your error has been happy, And I forgive it; but on this condition, That you attend me to the oratory; That so, with hearts prepar'd, you may approach The sacred altar, there to join your hands. [Exeunt. Scene, as at the opening of the play. Andrew and Griffith meeting. Grif. I pray you, honest friend, am I in my right way to the convent? And. Truly, sir, I should doubt it. You are in your right way to the Holy Land, I perceive, but whether that will lead you to the convent may deserve some pause. Grif. My question was a simple one. Don't let me spend more time upon your answer than I should save by your information. And. You shall lose neither time nor patience by me, sir; for I will attend you to the very convent's gate. I have been a soldier myself, and the very sight of a soldier exhilarates my heart. May I request the communication of your name and rank? Grif. My name is Griffith, at your service: I have the honour to be attach'd to Sir Hugh de Lacy, as his body-squire, and my business is with him. And. Sir Hugh de Lacy is a valorous gentleman; a more accomplish'd knight Christendom does not boast. He was governor of Ireland, and I remember to be told, that when O Ruark, the Irish chieftain, drew him to a parley, and treacherously attempted to knock out his brains with his battle-axe, a gallant Welshman of your name thrust his rapier through the body of the assassin, and laid him dead at his feet. Grif. He did. That Welshman was my father! And. Blessed be Saint David for his sake! Sir, I kiss the very hem of your garment with the most profound respect. Grif. By no means: only put me in my way to the convent; we can discourse as we walk. And. We can so, and truly I shall be happy to know your sentiments of this war, that is about to be set on foot in Palestine. Grif. The war in Palestine will be a bloody war. And. You are right, perfectly right. Wars are apt to be bloody. I have been in Palestine; these eyes have seen Jerusalem. Grif. I almost doubt if mine will see the convent. And. They need not, sir, for look! your knight is coming. I told you you would lose no time with me. Sir Hugh de Lacy and Sir Walter Scroop. Sir H. Griffith, well met! What tidings of our knights? Grif. All ready, all accoutred bright in arms, To grace the ceremony, that invests Their brave associate with the royal scarf; They only wait till you shall give the word. Sir H. Bear them my greetings back, and say the hour Is now at hand to put themselves in march. Tell them withal, that for their courtesy I render them my thanks with all my heart, In brotherly regard, and will report This their kind service, as it well deserves, To the Queen-regent, my most gracious mistress. Grif. This I shall do. What farther? Sir H. Nothing more. Farewell, brave Griffith!—Use your best dispatch. [Exit Grif. And. Most puissant and magnanimous knight, I humbly crave your pardon, upon the very knees of my heart, for the deficiency of my respect, when you were pleas'd to command my services to conduct you to Sir Walter Scroop; at which time I had not cognizance of your illustrious and princely person. Sir H. Friend, your behaviour needed no apology. And. Oh, my thrice-honour'd sir, if I had known it was Sir Hugh de Lacy I was speaking to, I would have strove to put my language into better trim; for I may say without offence to any, there is not in the realm a man, who holds your excellency in more true respect. Sir W. Silence that foolish tongue, and know your distance! you have said enough. Depart! And. That you should think I have said enough, I do not marvel, having yourself said nothing till this moment. But I depart, and humbly take my leave. [Exit. Sir H. Sir Walter Scroop, it moves my wonder much, Whilst all these honours fall so thick upon you, You are not happy? what's the cause of this? Sir W. Our spirits rise and fall without a cause. Sir H. The health indeed is out of fortune's reach. But you are thankful to the bounteous Queen. Sir W. Heaven knows my heart. Sir H. Lord Scroop of Feversham— A princely mansion and a rich domain— These are no trivial boons— Sir W. Far, far above My mean deservings. Sir H. I wo'nt call them such. Your loyalty has stood the test of time In various trials; but I'll not disguise How much her Highness holds you in esteem For your paternal care of the young knight, Whose fortune she espouses. Sir W. What I've done For him, in Christian charity I've done As for a creature thrown upon my mercy. I look'd not to her favour for reward. Sir H. And yet, without expecting it, you find Your charity is no unfruitful virtue. This creature, that was thrown upon your mercy, Has brought good fortune with him to your house, And gives no less protection than he finds. Sir W. The Queen is wondrous kind. Were she his mother, She could not be more zealous. Sir H. Hah! his mother? You say that by the way of illustration; But 'tis too bold a figure. Such a word, Dropt in the ears of babblers, might induce Dangerous conjectures. Sir W. Misconceive me not, Where the deep secret of his birth is buried, There I have left it. Sir H. Let it there abide Till his great deeds shall throw concealment off, And he stand forth confest in all his fame. Sir W. That day will never come. Sir H. That day is come; If Leicester makes conditions for his daughter, And states his high nobility debas'd. Sir W. He must not dare to think of Leicester's daughter. Sir H. Not dare to think! Let me not meet the man, Yourself excepted, who dares tell me that. Sir W. Be witness for me, truth, I did not court This painful subject: It was forc'd upon me. But if the Earl of Leicester gives his daughter To the mysterious youth, whom I have foster'd, He is disgrac'd, undone, and lost for ever. Sir H. I'll hear no more. You neither know of whom You speak these words, nor who I am that hear them. The Earl of Leicester enters. Earl of L. How now, my friends! why do your eyes exchange Those angry glances? what has pass'd between you? Sir H. Whate'er it was, your coming has dispers'd it, For in the presence of an honour'd friend Anger has time to cool. Earl of L. Heaven's grace forbid The falling out of friends, each to the other So dear, and both to me so truly kind. In you, Sir Walter, and your worthy Lady, I see the guardians of my long-lost child; You nurs'd her native virtues, but you left Her gentle heart accessible to love. From you, Sir Hugh de Lacy, I receiv'd The first impressions, that dispos'd my mind Towards the young hero, of whose gallant deeds You made such fair report. In him I saw That courtly 'haviour and becoming grace, That mark the august and sacred character Of chivalry, and when I heard my child With artless innocence confess her love, I listen'd without anger, and forgave her; Nay, more—I promis'd, when the war was over, I would confirm her choice, and join their hands. Sir H. And where's the man, who will presume to say, That Leicester is degraded by that choice? You're silent, sir— [To Sir Walter. Earl of L. Be patient, my good friend! No man will say it; 'twould be now too late. My sacred word is pledg'd—They wed this night. Sir W. Angels of mercy, interpose to save them! Sir H. There is my gage! I hurl it to the ground With indignation, and demand the lists Against the man, who dares to breathe a word Injurious to Sir Reginald de Tours; Whom I pronounce a true and noble knight, In all points worthy of great Leicester's choice— [Sir Walter Scroop turns away and exit. Lo where he goes! 'Tis so detraction shrinks When truth provokes the appeal. Earl of L. Redoubted knight, If you regard me, take your gauntlet up. Let us not stain our festival with blood. Sir H. My heart goes with my hand in what I've done; Why should I draw it back? Not I alone, The Queen herself, who by her scarf creates Sir Reginald the Servant of her love, Is pledg'd in honour to defend her knight. Earl of L. And who but Leicester shall defend the Queen? I hold that right as mine. Leave Scroop to me. If, as report suggests, he is infirm Of mind and craz'd, he may demand your pity, He cannot stir your anger. Sir H. On that plea I take my gauntlet up. And now, my lord, Confiding in your word, (as who may not?) I shall convoke our knights, who wait my call, To grace the nuptials of your noble daughter With their companion, Reginald de Tours. [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. A Cloister belonging to the Convent. Sir Walter and Lady Scroop. Sir W. I'll not be follow'd. Leave me. Lady S. Oh, for mercy Hear me, direct me, save me from despair. This dreadful secret weighs my nature down; My soul sinks under it. Sir W. You wrung it from me; In an unguarded moment you surpriz'd me. Sorrow had seal'd my bosom, till the news Of Reginald's departure burst upon me In one short gleam of joy; then, then it was You sooth'd me into folly, and betray'd me. Lady S. You do me wrong. Your secret is secure. I've had the poor devoted victims with me; Witness'd their fond endearments, seen their transports, Heard them announce their now-impending doom, And not betray'd you. Sir W. That avails me nothing: Whilst I forbore to speak, I had my choice Still to be dumb, but when I let you share My secrets, I compell'd you to partake The horrors of concealment, and embark'd Your conscience in like peril with my own. Single in guilt, perhaps I had preferr'd Remorse to ruin, splendid misery To honourable death. But now 'tis done; All shall come out. I will not sink your soul To save my wretched life: therefore away! I wait for Leicester here: I stand to guard This passage to the altar, and present My bosom to De Lacy's fierce assault. Lady S. What do you tell me? oh, too much, too much! Or fly your danger, or let me partake it. Sir W. No; I've already done the fatal deed, That draws inevitable ruin on us. Farewell to all our honours, all our hopes! To the stern dictates of imperious conscience I sacrifice the world and all its joys. Lady S. I will not, cannot leave you thus distress'd. Sir W. This last, this fond embrace, and then—no more. I have now strung my spirit to the pitch, And will not suffer weakness to approach me In the soft form of woman. Fare thee well! Begone at once, for by my soul I swear, If you persist, 'twill be to see me fall By my own sword. Lady S. Heaven's mercy be your guard! [Exit. Sir Walter Scroop alone. Nature, religion, laws divine and human, Cry out on incest, and denounce these nuptials. What then, what then? They know not their offence; And where there is no consciousness of guilt, No punishment can follow the commission. There's hope for them; but hope includes not me. Man cannot penetrate the thoughts of man, But there is one, to whom all thoughts are known, And in whose sight all secrets stand confest. He, ere pollution shall approach his altar, Can call the self-accusing spirit up, Give insubstantial air a shadowy form, And rescue nature from the impending curse. Rise then, dead Adela, awake from sleep, Thou, that art here entomb'd, ascend to sight, Shade of a conscious mother— Lady Scroop appears. Hah! begone! Have I not warn'd you hence? why do you come To fright imagination, and enhance The terror of my thoughts? Lady S. Be not amaz'd. I come not to alarm you, but to guard; To give your spirit time for recollection, And wake you from your trance—Leicester approaches. [Exit Lady S. Sir Walter Scroop. Now then, my heart, be firm! vain terrors, hence! And thou, my evil genius, that art busy With thy accurst temptations to seduce My conscience from its properties, avaunt! Yes, thou unsparing monitor, thou just But merciless remembrancer, I know Not all the world can bribe thee to withdraw Thine arrows from my bosom, and allow Sweet sleep to enter, till I have fulfill'd Thy strict commandment; nor can I acquit My account with Heaven till I am clear with thee. Now, Leicester, I am ready—Lo, he comes— Earl of Leicester enters. Earl of L. You're happily encounter'd, good Sir Walter. I've much desir'd this meeting—Ah, my friend, Give me your hand—All is not well, I fear; You are not chearful as you wont to be. When every face is lighted up with smiles, You damp our joys with sullenness and sorrow. Sir W. It is not that I've lost the sense of joy, Or ceas'd to sympathize in what concerns you, If I am sad: not so, my honour'd lord; Your happiness is dear to me as ever; Believe me on my word. But above all, Let not De Lacy, or the Monk, persuade you That I have lost possession of my mind, And gone astray from reason. They will tell you That I am mad; it is themselves are mad, When they would tempt you to this fatal act. Earl of L. Though I could well conjecture what you mean By fatal act, yet, if you mean me well, Deal fairly with me. I am sick of hints; I abhor mystery. Honesty disclaims it. Sir W. Then arm yourself with patience; good my lord, As I am mov'd by friendship, when I tell you You must adjourn these inauspicious nuptials To future time, and some far-distant chance, That never shall take place. Earl of L. Away! you're mad. Sir W. Unless 'tis madness for your sake to suffer These pangs, with which you wring confession from me, And sacrifice my peace of mind to yours, I am not mad. I know I must abide De Lacy's vengeance, Eleanor's displeasure, With loss of all my hopes, my friends, my fortune, Perhaps my life itself; and yet I swear You must not, shall not wed your Adela To Reginald de Tours. Earl of L. Is he not worthy; Is he not virtuous, brave? did not the sword Of Richard knight him in the breach at Tours? Doth not the Queen array him with her scarf? Do not De Lacy, Ambrose, press the nuptials? Though of mysterious birth, does he not carry The mark of true nobility upon him? Sir W. All, all, that can compose and build him up To human excellence, he does contain And centre in himself. Virtuous and brave He surely is; and nobly born withal, Alas, too nobly—There the sorrow lurks, There the deep secret lies, which to uproot Unseats my very heart. 'Twas in the year, When you were on your embassy to Rome, That Reginald was born. Earl of L. Go on: proceed! Sir W. The Queen, our regent, then was in disgrace; And Henry, who was moving for divorce, Kept her imprison'd here at Feversham. Earl of L. 'Tis fresh in my remembrance. Pass that over! Sir W. The Lady Leicester, your departed wife, Shar'd her confinement, chear'd her solitude, And liv'd an inmate with her in the castle. Earl of L. They were the truest, dearest friends on earth; It seem'd as if one heart inspir'd them both. Eighteen long months my Adela remain'd In solitude, and led a widow'd life, Whilst at the sovereign Pontiff's court I plied My long depending inauspicious suit. Sir W. 'Twas then that Reginald first saw the light. In the mid-hour of night I was awaken'd, And secretly conducted to the palace. A female, whom I knew not, led me on By various turnings to a lady's chamber: She held her new-born infant in her arms, And fervently implor'd me to protect him. I took him, rear'd him, lov'd him as my own; 'Twas Reginald, 'twas this unconscious son Of a mysterious mother— Earl of L. Stop! 'Tis she, In whose defence, on my anointed King Furious I drew my sacrilegious sword. Oh my prophetic soul, it is confirm'd! What need of words? For tell-tale nature speaks, And in a mother's fondness finds the source Of all the multitude of honours shower'd On this descendant from a race of kings. No more—These vaulted cloisters shall not catch The echo of a name, that should be sacred. Sir W. No, you must seek a name more sacred still, More hard for me to speak, and you to hear. Think only what your horror would have been, Had you permitted them to join their hands, And found one common mother of them both. Earl of L. Why that is she that lies in holy earth; That is dead Adela— Sir W. Oh fatal truth! She was the mother— Earl of L. I will have conviction. Tear up the pavement; drag her from her coffin, And let me see her heart. I will be satisfied. Where is the wretch, the villain that seduc'd her? Sir W. My lord, my lord, these transports will unfit you For that immediate duty, which demands Your instant presence to forbid the nuptials. Earl of L. Are they not married? That impatient monk, Hath he not solemniz'd th' incestuous rites? Sir W. No, be assur'd. Let us not waste the time, But haste, and save them. Earl of L. Oh, my heart, my heart! [Exeunt. Scene draws off, and discovers the Abbey Church of the Convent. Sir Hugh de Lacy and Reginald. Sir H. Here, whilst our brave companions of the cross Dispose themselves in march, I must arrest Your fond impatience for a few short minutes, And call your best attention to the matter, Which I shall now unfold. Sir R. I have an ear For ever open to your sage advice, A heart for ever ready to obey you. Sir H. You see these knights, the noblest in the realm, What honours they intend you. 'Tis the Queen That prompts them to this service; 'tis for her They deign to move in a dependent sphere, Like satellites around your splendid orb. Was ever knight so graced as you will be, When, by the hands of love and beauty deck'd, Upon your mailed cuirass you display In glittering folds the favours of a queen? Sir R. I'm lost in wonder, nor can trace a cause Why all these bounties should descend on me, But that our gracious Queen is mov'd with pity For a deserted creature. Sir H. Let your reason Resolve these questions, ere you talk of pity— Why are you now permitted to espouse The wealthiest heiress in the realm of England? Why, but because the Queen protects your suit? Leicester's recall'd from exile, all his honours Restor'd, his fines and forfeitures revers'd, What are they but the price for his consent? The princely largess she bestows on Scroop, And Ambrose from an humble monk become A mitred abbot—can you fail to find The source of all these bounties in yourself? How can affection speak in plainer terms, And what more can the fondest mother do For a beloved son? Sir R. What can I say? I will not talk of gratitude; I feel it. Sir H. There is yet more—Scroop will oppose your marriage; But Scroop's deceiv'd, and does not know your parents. She, that impos'd you on him for her son, Is long since dead; but she, that bore you, lives, And will avow you. Sir R. Oh, reveal her to me, And be my more than father! Sir H. Were I less, Or other than by nature what I am, I should be much unworthy such a son. Sir R. Sir!—I must hope you cannot mean to mock me. How must I understand those awful words? Sir H. I am your father, but you must reserve Your knees for her, who has the better claim: Stand not as one amaz'd; but hear me further— Dear to my soul thou art, and whilst these arms Enfold and press thee to a father's bosom, Oh! recollect 'twas virtue made thee great. Keep her, my son, for ever in thy sight!— When fortune in full splendour bursts upon thee, Undazzled by the blaze, recal to mind, When first adventuring forth into the world, There was a path to lazy pride unknown, A path, which none but virtuous heroes trod, That led thee up to fame. Sir R. Oh, guard me still! And, if the false lights of a treacherous world Mislead and puzzle my uncertain course, Then, then come forth, recal my devious steps, And put me in the glorious track again! Sir H. Be sure of that, my son; and, as this arm, Whilst at thy side I fought, hath thrown my shield Before thy gallant breast, and on its orb Receiv'd the javelin, that was hurl'd at thee, So to temptation's shafts will I oppose My counsel, and protect thee from disgrace. Sir R. I feel my danger. When I was obscure, A thing whom no one own'd, I was as proud As conscience would allow of, and aspir'd To make myself a station with the best. But now, when brought from darkness into light, I see that fame is no inheritance, That honour can't descend, but must be earn'd; And in proportion as the name you give Is loftier far than any I could gain, So is my task the harder to deserve it. Sir H. Break off, my son. Behold where Leicester comes. Leicester followed by Scroop. Earl of L. Where is my daughter? I forbid the nuptials: They are profane, unnatural, and accurst. Avoid the altar; fly!—What dost thou here? Begone, thou son of an adulterous mother; Begone, and never let me see thee more! Sir H. Leicester, forbear! You know not what you say. You are deceiv'd. Scroop is himself deceiv'd. Both are in error. With a single word I could convince you—but the monk approaches— Ambrose enters, and after him Lady Scroop with Adela follow. Father, deliver what you have in charge From the Queen-mother to the Earl of Leicester, And let her speak— [Ambrose delivers a seal'd paper to Leicester. Leicester opens and reads. Earl of L. Oh Heaven and earth! This paper superscribed, The Confession Of the unhappy, guilty Eleanor— Brings with it peace to me and all. Attend, whilst I unfold the important scroll. “Let none persuade you to suspect your wife: “She is a saint in bliss. I am the mother “Of Reginald de Tours—Lacy the father. “The wrongs I suffer'd from the faithless King, “If judg'd with candour, might extenuate, “But Heaven alone can pardon my offence.” Oh! bless'd confession! which gives happiness To those whose virtues merit the heav'n-born gift! Join, join your hands, ye consecrated pair! Father and son, thrice welcome to my arms. O, Scroop, when now all mystery is dispell'd, Let all mistakes be buried in oblivion. From deepest sorrow I emerge to joy: Darkness is banish'd, and a glorious light Beams from the throne on this illustrious youth Amb. Joy to my Reginald! We've seen him rise To honours nobly earn'd, and ere he knew The greatness he was born to, make himself, By his own virtues great, till he became The founder of his own nobility. Sir W. O Reginald, what bliss will now be mine, When at the nuptial altar I behold That happy union, which I blindly strove, In conscience, though in error, to prevent. Sir R. So many are my blessings, and so vast My debt of gratitude, I must entreat That you will judge me not by my professions, But by the test of actions, and believe me In words alone defective, not in heart. Here is my guardian angel; whilst I keep And merit this protection, I am safe. Lady S. Oh, my beloved Adela, to tell What agonies have rent this tortur'd heart For your dear sake, exceeds the power of words But all is past; the sorrows that bedew'd Those beauteous eyes with tears, are now dispers'd Like clouds, that flit before the uprising sun, When Nature bursts in all her charms upon us. Lady A. That you, so gentle and so full of pity, Have not to witness and bewail my fate, I am most happy: much it glads me also, That now my noble father will confess His daughter is not humbled by her choice: But it was Reginald, obscure, unknown, The virtuous hero, whom I lov'd and honour'd For merits all his own. Crowns could not add One atom to the stature of his fame, One feather to his weight in my esteem. Had he been conscious of his high descent, He might have been less humble, I less fond, And each o'erlook'd by each, had never met. Earl of L. Enough, my friends! for now the altar waits; Its holy ministers prepare to chant Their choral strains, as chivalry directs. That ceremony past, the Knight, array'd In all his royal honours, shall from me Receive his blooming bride, and whilst the priest His nuptial benediction shall pronounce, The attendant warriors shall attest that none But hand so brave should join with hand so fair.</field>
