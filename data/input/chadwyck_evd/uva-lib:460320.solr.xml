      <field name="fulltext">This Prologue was undoubtedly not written by Plautus, as is apparent from V. 16, &amp;c. but probably, many years after his death, on the revival of some of his pieces; and in particular of this Comedy, in compliance with the taste of the age; or as it is expressed in the original, V. 11. ad populi rumorem.PROLOGUE. Most excellent spectators! Ye who honour Above all other things the goddess Faith, As above all her other votaries She is best pleas'd with you; I bid you welcomeâ If I have spoke your sentiments, declare, By giving me some mark of approbation, That I may know, you're from the very opening Candid and favourable to meâThose Who chuse old wine to drink, I esteem wise; So I do those, who come through choice to see Old comediesâIf antique works and words To modern ye prefer, with equal reason Ye should prefer old comedies to new onesâ For the new comedies that now come out, Are baser far than is our new coin'd moneyâ We, therefore, having heard from public rumour How earnestly ye long'd to have presented Before you on the stage, some plays of Plautus, Revive this antique comedy of his; Which heretofore by those of the elder class, Had been receiv'd with approbation. As to the younger part of this our audience, They, I'm assur'd, know nothing of the matter; But I'll endeavour to inform them of it. When first this comedy was represented, It far surpass'd all others of that time: Yet, at that time, liv'd many famous poets, Who now are gone from hence into that place Common to all men; but who, though departed, Continue still to please, and to instruct us, Better than those now with us.âTherefore I Most earnestly intreat you all to give A strict attention to our present scenesâ Cast from your thoughts all care for getting money, Nor let the debtor fear his creditor. 'Tis a red letter'd day: no business done, Or at the forum or amongst the bankers. All's quiet now, and these are halcyon daysâ And when the publick games are going forward, There is no paying or receiving money. If then your ears are in a cue to hear, Give your attention. First I will explain to you The name of this our comedyâ'Tis call'd In Greek Clerumene; which means a wife Drawn for by lotsâ'Twas in that language written By DiphilusâOur Plautus afterwards Translated it, and brought it on our stage, Calling it Casina, a name betokening That dog-like barking you shall hear anonâ A married man in years lives in this houseâ He has a son, which son lives with him hereâ He also has a slave here, who is now In sickness down, and to his bed confin'dâ But heretofore, some sixteen years now past, This slave, at break of day, beheld a girl Carried to be expos'd; he to the woman Who was exposing her, directly went, And beg'd her she would give the girl to him; He by entreaty got her, bore her off, Carried her home directly; to Cleostrata, His mistress, gave her; beg'd her to take care of her, And bring her upâCleostrata complies; And of her education takes great care; Scarce less, than if she had been indeed her daughter. When she grew up to be a woman, Stalino, For that's the old man's name, fell desperately In love with her; as did his son, Euthynicus. Father and son, each muster now their forces, Unknown howe'er to each otherâNow the father, His bailiff in the country has deputed To ask her for his wife, in hopes thereby, Should he succeed, he might then have from home A friend to toy away an idle hour with, And his own wife know nothing of the matter. The son deputes his armour-bearer, bids him Demand her for his wife; as knowing, should His deputy obtain her, he himself Would have the girl he loves in his possession. The wife begins to smell a rat; and finding The old man is in love, joins with her son To make a dupe of himâBut he, perceiving His son to be in love with the same girl, And that he'd be a hindrance to his passion, Sends the young man abroad upon his travels. His mother, conscious of the whole affair, Takes her son's part, tho' absentâBut expect not To see him make a part of this our comedy; He'll not return as yet into the city. Our author did not choose he shouldâAnd so Has broken down the bridge, that as he journey'd Lay in his wayâBut it is not improbable Some of you may be saying 'mongst yourselves, What is all this about? Marriage with slaves! Can slaves or ask a wife, or marry one? This doctrine's new, it never has been practis'd. But I'll maintain, that both at Greece and Carthage, And in this very country here, Apulia, The thing is doneâAnd that the marriages Of slaves are celebrated with more care Than those of freemen. Who will wager with me A jug of wine? and I'll refer it to A Grecian, Carthaginian, or Apulian. What now? I find none here will take my betâ You none of you are thirstyâI return To the young foundling, her whom the two slaves, Each by his various arts contends to wedâ She shall be found to be an honest girl, Free born, and an Athenian: nor shall she In this our comedy act ought immodestly. But when the play is ended, if, by Hercules! Some one among you'll give her a round sum, She'll marry you, nor wait at all for omens: I have said what I'd to say. And now farewell: Attend to what you are about with care, And, as you've ever done, with your true valour Prevail over your enemies, and ours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter OLYMPIO. CHALINUS following him. OLYMPIO. Can't I take care of my affairs myself, Speak as I will, and think too as I will, And you not put your finger in the pye? Why ever at my tail, you scoundrel you? Chal. Because it is with me a thing determin'd, Where'er you go, to follow like your shadow: Nay farther yet, go you even to the gallows, By Pollux' temple! thither will I follow. Now, rascal, you may judge if e'er henceforward, Make use of every artifice you can, You can deprive me of my Casina Without my privity, as 'tis your scheme. Olym. What business have you to concern yourself With me? Chal. How! impudence! what's that you say? What dost thou creeping in the city here, Thou reptile clown, 'mongst those that are thy betters? Olym. Why, 'cause I chuse it. Chal. Why not in the country, Presiding o'er the farm, and taking care Of what you are intrusted with?âTake care Of that, nor meddle with our town affairs. What! are you come here to bear off my mistress? Back to the country, hence! go and be hang'd! You there are in your province. Olym. I know well What I'm about, Chalinus; nor do I Forget my dutyâI've left charge at home, All in the country will be taken care of. As to my being here in town, when I Have for my wife obtain'd, and made secure The fair, the tender Casina, your flame And fellow slave in the same house with you; I say, when I shall bring her home with me, Into the country as my wife, I'll then Enjoy myself in quiet in my province. Chal. You marry her? Ere that shall be, by Hercules! And you enjoy her love, my end shall be A halter. Olym. She already is my plunder. Tuck yourself up directly thenâ Chal. Go dig In your own dunghill; there your plunder lies. Olym. Fye, fye upon you! Yet you soon shall know That this is so; and know how many ways My wedding, if I live, shall make you miserable. Chal. Why, what will you do to me? Olym. What do to you? First you shall bear the lighted torch yourself Before my new espoused bride: and then You'll afterward be held in no esteem. And next, when you're arrived at the farm, You'll have a pitcher given you, and be shewn One way which leads directly to the spring, One spring, one kettle, and eight casks: all which, If they're not always full, you may be sure You'll have your belly full of lashes: nay, Your back shall be so bent with drawing water, 'Twill serve to make a crupper of. And then When in the country you are got, unless You live on fodder like the cattle, or, Just as an earth-worm fed upon the soil; If you but ask to taste of ought besides, Fasting itself shan't be more thin with fasting, Than you shall be, by Pollux' temple! Then When you are tired out, and starv'd with hunger, You'll have at night the bed you've merited. Cha. What shall it be? Olym. Why, thou shalt be shut up In a small nook within my room, from whence, Thou may'st hear all she says, when I caress her: May'st hear her say, my soul! my dear Olympio, My life, my joy, my love, my dearest pleasure, My darling husband! let me kiss those eyes, Let me thus shew I love thee, and give loose To every fond desire, and fond embrace. May'st hear her call me, her sweet love, her chick, Her dove, her dear cock sparrow, and her leveret. While thus she cooes upon me, thou, poor wretch! Shalt wriggle like a mouse, pent up within The middle of thy crannyâThat thou may'st not Seek how to answer now to what I've said, I get me goneâI'll talk to thee no longerâ [Exit. Chal. Go when thou wilt, I'll follow like thy shadow; Thou shalt do nothing here without my company. [Exit after him. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter CLEOSTRATA and PARDALISCA. CLEOSTRATA [to PARDALISCA.] Lock up the store-room, and bring me the key. I'll just step to my neighbour here hard by, And if my husband should want ought with me, Let me be hither call'd immediately. Par. He had order'd to have dinner got for himâ Cle. 'Stâhold your tongue, and get you gone. [Exit Par.] I've not Provided any dinner, nor to-day Shall one be dress'dâsince he, to gratify His passion, sets him 'gainst his son and me. Infamous man! I'll punish him with hunger, And thirst; in word, in deed I'll be reveng'd, And say, and do him all the spite I'm able. In love forsooth! I'll plague him with my tongue, By Pollux! and I'll make him lead the life He well deserves; food for the grave, debauch'd, Stable of filth! I'll pour out my complaints Here to my neighbourâThe door creaksâHerself Is coming out. Troth, I've ill nick'd the time. SCENE II. Enter MYRRINA, [speaking to her servants within.] Myr. You, my attendants, follow me just byâ You there!âDoes any of you hear my orders? I'm to be found in this place, if my husband, Or any one besides should ask for me. When I'm at home alone, I am so drowsy, My work drops from my hands. Did I not order My distaff to be brought? Cle. Good day, Myrrina. Myr. The same to you, by Castor! But why sad, My dear? Cle. No more so than those use to be Who've got bad husbandsâAt home or abroad, They always have enough to make them sadâ I was just going to your house. Myr. In troth! And I was going too to yours. But what is't That vexes you? whatever discontent You feel, I feel the same. Cle. Troth I believe it. For there's not any neighbour I love more, Nor who deserves it better than yourself; Nor one with whom I'd wish to be more intimateâ Myr. I thank youâLet me know then what it is? Cle. My husband in a most unworthy manner Has acted towards me; nor have I the advantage To enjoy what is my own. Myr. How! What is that You say? Repeat it once again. By Pollux! I can't conceive the cause of your complaints. Cle. My husband in a most unworthy manner Has acted towards me. Myr. Wonderful indeed! If what you say is true. For husbands scarce Can from their wives obtain what is their due. Cle. Well then, he wants a waiting-maid that's mine, Brought up at my expence, to give his bailiff, Spite of my teeth too. But he is in love With her himself. Myr. No more of that, I beg you. Cle. Here we may say our pleasure: for we areâ Myr. True, so we are: But say, how came you by This waiting-maid? You know, a modest wife Should never be possest of any property Her husband knows not of; and if she is, She can't make use of it, but she must pilfer From him, or else obtain it by bad means. Whatever is your own, in my opinion, Is all your husband's property. Cle. All this You speak against your friend. Myr. You simpleton, No more, but list to meâOppose him not. Let him love on: let him do what he likes, So he but gives you all your rights at home. Cle. Have you your senses? Why you speak against Your proper interest. Myr. 'Tis you are a fool. Take care your husband make you not that compliment. Cle. What compliment? Myr. Divorce you. Cle. 'St! no more. Myr. The matter? Cle. 'St. Myr. Why, whom d'you see? Cle. My husband Is coming back, look there. Myr. Go in, make haste. I begâ Cle. I willingly complyâI'm goneâ Myr. We shall be more at leisure by and by, I then will talk with you: adieu! Cle. Adieu! [stands apart. [Exit Myrrina. SCENE III. Enter STALINO. Stal. In my opinion love's to be preferr'd To all things; and of every excellency 'Tis the most excellent. Nor is there aught That can be mention'd, has a higher relish, Or more of sweetness in it. I much wonder, Your cooks, who use so many different sorts Of seasoning, should never in their sauces Put some of this, which so excells them all. The sauce that has the seasoning of love Must please all palates. And without a mixture, A little dash of love, no sauce will have A relish, nor taste sweet upon the palate. Love changes gall to honey, to sweet, bitter; Clears up the gloom, and renders strait the man Agreeable and pleasant. This opinion, I from my own experience rather form Than what I hear without doors. For, e'er since I've been in love with Casina, I surpass Neatness itself in neatness. Now I visit All the perfumers; and where'er I meet A perfume that is excellent, I use it, That I may please her. And it seems to me That I succeedâBut there's one thing torments me, My wife's aliveâI see her standing there, And gloomy too. However disagreeable, I must be civil to herânotwithstandingâ My wife! my joy, how do'st thou? [to Cle. Cle. Get you gone, And touch me not. Sta. O fie! O fie! my Juno, It don't become thee to behave so peevishly To thine own JupiterâWhere art going now? Cle. Let me alone. Sta. Nay stay. Cle. I will not stay. Sta. By Pollux! then I'll follow thee. Cle. I prithee! Have you your wits? Sta. Yes sure, when I love thee. Cle. I do not want your love. Sta. You'll have it tho'. Cle. I'm plagu'd to death w'you. Sta. Would that you spoke truth. Cle. There I believe youâ Sta. But look back upon me, My sweetingâ Cle. Yes, as much as you are mine. But whence this stink of perfumes? Sta. I'm undone! Plainly discover'd. Why not with my cloak Strait wipe them of? May Mercury confound thee, Thou vile perfumer, that hast given them me! Cle. Thou good for nothing grey old gnat; I scarce Refrain from calling you what you deserve. One of your age to walk the streets, perfum'd so! Sta. By Pollux! I was only with a friend Who bought some. Cle. See, how soon he has hammer'd out An answer! Are you then asham'd of nothing? Sta. Yes, I'm asham'd of ev'ry thing you'd have. Cle. What brothel, say, have you been lying in? Sta. I, in a brothel! Cle. Yes, I know more of you Than you imagine. Stal. Well, what is't you know? Cle. That you're of all old fellows the most sneaking. Thou thing of nothing, whence art thou now come? Where hast thou been? What whore hast thou been lying with? Where is it thou'st been drinking? Yes, 'tis so, By Castor's temple! look but at his cloak, How wrinkled 'tis. Sta. The gods confound us both! If I have touch'd a drop of wine to-day. Cle. Well, well, do what you like: drink, eat, consume Your substance. Sta. Hold, wife, now there is enough. Restrain your tongue, you din my ears too much. Be sparing of your chattering, leave some To scold at me to-morrow. But what say you? Has't so far got the better of thy temper, To do the thing thy husband has desir'd, Rather than contradict him? Cle. About what? Sta. A pretty question that? why touching Casina Your handmaid, to bestow her as a wife On our Olympio here, an honest servant; With him all will be well: she'll have her wood, Bath, food, and cloathing; she will have wherewith To bring up any children she may have; Rather than give her to that armour-bearer, That good for nothing sorry fellow there, Who is not worth a single doit; unless It is a leaden one. Cle. By Castor's temple! I wonder much, that at your time of life You should not know your duty. Sta. How! Why so? Cle. For if you did what's right and reasonable, You'd leave to me the care of my maid-servants; It is my proper business. Sta. So you'd give her, (A mischief on you!) to that 'squire at armes? Cle. We should do something for our only son. Sta. Tho' he's my only son, he is not more My only son, than I'm his only father. And 'tis more just that to my will he should Conform himself, than I to his.â Cle. Good man, You're only seeking evil for yourself, By Castor's temple! Sta. Yes, she smells a rat, [aside. I find 'tis soâ[to her] What! I, do you say? Cle. Yes, you. Why that impatient air else? why desire This thing so vehemently? Sta. Because I'd rather She should be given to an honest servant Than a dishonest one. Cle. Suppose I should Intreat, nay more, engage Olympio, On my account, to give her up to him? Sta. Suppose I from Chalinus should obtain His free consent to take her? Why, then I Should gain my point. Cle. We stand on even ground then. Shall I, in your name, call Chalinus hither? You'll talk with him, as I will with Olympio. Sta. With all my heart. Cle. He'll soon be hereâAnd now Let's try, which of us two can best persuade. [Exit. Sta. May Hercules! and all the gods confound her! Now I'm at liberty to say as much. This love torments me, and in my opinion My wife makes it a point to make me angry. She has some mistrust of what I am contriving, And for that reason she assists Chalinus. SCENE IV. Enter CHALINUS. Sta. May all the gods and goddesses confound him! [aside, and seeing Chal. entering. Chal. Your wife, sir, told me that you wanted me. Sta. 'Tis true, I order'd her to send you to me. Cha. Tell me your pleasure. Sta. First, I'd have you speak With a more open countenance. Cha. 'Twould be A folly to be gloomy in his presence, Who has such power o'er me. Sta. Long ago I've look'd upon thee as an honest fellow. Cha. I know so. Yet if that was your opinion, Why have you not before this time bestow'd My freedom on me? Sta. I have wish'd to do it. But my intention will not signify, Unless you now assist me with your actions. Cha. I should be glad to know what you'd command me. Sta. AttendâI'll tell youâI have promised To marry Casina to our Olympio. Cha. But both your wife and son have promised To marry her to me. Sta. I know it well. But would you rather live a single man, And have your freedom giv'n you; or be married, And you and all your children still be slaves? You have your choice; so take which likes you best. Cha. I must preserve my life at my own peril, Should I be free; 'tis now preserv'd at yours. For Casina, to no man born I'll yield her. Sta. Go in, and call my wife directly hither. And bring the urn, some water, and the lotsâ Cha. Contentâ Sta. Her plot I some how will defeat. For if I can get nothing by persuasion, At least I'll try my fate by lot. And there I may avenge myself on your abettors. Cha. Yet for all that the lot may fall on me. Sta. That with vexation you may burst yourself. Cha. Yet I will marry her, plot what you will, And in whatever wayâ Sta. Hence from my sight! Cha. I know you look at me against your will: Yet notwithstanding I may live the longer. [Exit. Sta. And am not I a wretch! All things go contrary. I am afraid my wife may have prevail'd Upon Olympio not to marry Casina. 'Tis over with me then in my old age. If she has not prevail'd, I have some hope In the decision of my fate by lot. If too the lot deceives me, I've no more To do, but make a pillow of my sword, And lay me down upon'tâThings howe'er Go well; for see, Olympio coming hither. [stands apart. SCENE V. Enter OLYMPIO, speaking to CLEOSTRATA within. Olym. By Pollux' temple! rather shut me up At once in a hot oven, and there bake me Like a sea-biscuit, rather than gain of me What you requireâ Sta. [aside.] So, safe's the wordâFrom what I hear, my hope's secure. Olym. Why frighten me With mentioning my liberty? which, if Neither yourself, nor yet your son will give me, In spite of both your teeth I can obtain it; And that too for a trifle. Sta. What is this? [to him. Who is it you are wrangling with, Olympio? Olym. The same you're ever wrangling with yourself. Sta. What, with my wife? Olym. Why tell me of your wife? You're as it were a hunter; pass your life, Your days and nights too, with a cur that is Howling perpetually. Sta. What is she about? What is she talking to you of? Olym. She begs, Intreats I would not marry Casina. Sta. What have you said to that? Olym. Why I have told her I would not give her up to Jove himself, If he should beg her of me. Sta. May the gods preserve you! To be assisting to me. Olym. Now, her blood Is altogether in a ferment; she's In such a chafe against me. Sta. I could wish By Pollux' temple! she would burst asunder. Olym. Troth! if you manage well, I think she has. But your affection, sir, has made me enemies. Your wife's my enemy, your son's the same; The same my fellow slaves. Sta. What's that to you? So Jupiter is but propitious to you, No matter for the lesser gods, despise them. Olym. Meer empty words!âAs if you did not know Our Jupiters below may die, when least They think of, or expect it. And at length If you, who are my Jupiter, should die, And to the lesser gods your empire pass, Who'll of my back take care, my head, my legs? Sta. Affairs, I tell you, will go better with you Than you imagine, if I can obtain This of you, that I may enjoy my Casina. Olym. By Hercules! I think that ne'er can be, Because your wife's so earnest to prevent My having her. Sta. But thus I'll manage it. I'll throw the lots into the urn, and draw For you and for Chalinus. Thus it stands. 'Tis necessary, now the sword is drawn, To throw away the scabbard. Olym. But suppose The lot should not turn out what you would have it? Sta. Speak words of better omenâI rely On my good fortune; let us hope in that. Olym. I would not give a farthing for such hopes. All mortal men rely upon good fortune, Yet many of them have I seen deceiv'd. Sta. Peace, peace a little. Olym. What's the matter, sir? Sta. See, there's Chalinus coming from the house Both with the urn and lots. For open war then. [stands apart. SCENE VI. Enter CLEOSTRATA and CHALINUS with an urn, and lots. Cle. Give me to know, Chalinus, what my husband Would have with meâ Cha. Have?âwhy, by Castor's temple! To see you burning on the funeral pile Without the Metian gate. Cle. I well believe it. Cha. 'Tis more than my belief, I know 'tis certain. Sta. I've in my house more artists than I thought for. This man, I find, is a divinerâWell, Suppose we hoist our standards, and go meet him. Follow me.âWell, the matter? Cha. See, I've brought All that you order'd me; your wife, the lots, The urn, ay, and myself into the bargain. Sta. That last is what I did not want. Cha. I thought so. I'm in your sides a thorn, I seeâI say This to you, for I see you're in a sweat. Hark ye! does not your dear heart pant thro' fear? Sta. A scoundrel!â Cle. Peace, and hold your tongue, Chalinus. Correct him there. Olym. Nay, rather him, who dares Put in his oar. Sta. Now hither bring the urn, Give me the lots: and lend me your attention. I've ever thought [to Cle.] my dear, to have ow'd to you And to your importunity, that Casina Should have been yielded up to my disposal, To be my wife: and still I think the same. Cle. What! given up to you? Sta. Yes sure, to me. Psha! that is not the thing I'd sayâNo, not To him, to me I meant: thro' eagerness To have her for myself, by Hercules! I've long been chattering amiss, meer prattle. Cle. By Pollux! so you have; and still do soâ Sta. For him! no! for myself, by Hercules! Ah! now at length, with much ado, I'm gotten Into the right roadâ Cle. Very frequently By Pollux! you get out of 'tâ Sta. So it happens Whene'er we long for any thing with earnestnessâ But both of us, both he and I now sue To you for each our right. Cle. How's that? Sta. My honey! I'll tell thee: 'tis to give our bailiff here Our Casina for a wife. Cle. By Pollux! no; Nor do I think it should be done. Sta. Well then We'll draw the lots. Cle. Who hinders you from doing it? Sta. I think it is the best and fairest way. In one word, if it happens as we wish, We shall rejoice: if not, why then, we must Bear it with patience.âHere's a lot for you. [giving a lot to Olympio. See what's the mark upon it. Olym. Number one. Cha. It is not fair to give a lot to him [pointing to Olympio. Before you've given one to me. Sta. Take thisâ [giving a lot to Cha. Cha. Well, give it meâBut hold, there is a thing Comes now into my mindâLook in the urn, And see there is no other lot beneath The water. Sta. Rascal! think you that I am Like youâThere's none I tell youâSo be quiet. Cha. O may the chance be mine, to thy destruction! Olym. By Pollux' temple! I suppose it will: I know your piety; 'twill well deserve it. HoldâIs your lot of poplar wood, or sir? Cha. What's that to you? Olym. Because I am afraid Lest it should float upon the water. Sta. Brave! Take care nowâCast the lots for bothâ No cheating, wife, by Ceres! no. Olym. To her I do not chuse to trust. Sta. Come, courage, man! Olym. She'll lay a spell upon the lot, by Hercules! If once she touches it. Cha. No words. Olym. I've done; And pray the gods to be propitious to me! Cha. So be it, and make you bear along with you The handcuff and the gibbet. Olym. No, I tell you, Not so, but that the lot may fall to me. Cha. And that you strait be hang'd up by the feet, By Hercules! Olym. And when you snuff your nose, Your eyes may through it fall from out your head. But why afraid? Ay, there's no more to do, But to prepare the ropeâ'Tis over with you. Sta. Prithee, attend to what you are about. Olym. Well, I have done. Sta. Now, you, Cleostrata, Lest you should think that I in this affair Have acted with deceit, I give you leave. Draw you the lotâ Olym. You ruin me. Cha. No, no. It will be an advantage. Cle. You do well. Cha. I pray the gods, your lot may run away From out the urn. Olym. How's that? Because you are Yourself a runaway; you'd have all else Be like you. No, I rather wish your lot May, as you're drawing it, dissolve within The water, in like manner, as 'tis said That did of Hercules' descendantâ Cha. No, Rather, that you be made so hot with lashes, That you shall melt yourself. Sta. Have done, Olympio. Olym. I will, if that mark'd rascal would but let me. Sta. Now may the gods be favourable to me! Olym. With all my heart; and to me too! Cha. Not so. Olym. By Hercules! Yes. Cha. By Hercules! I say To me. Stal. He'll win, and you will live a wretch. Give him a good round slap i'th'chops for me. Do as I bid you. Cle. Lift not up your hand. Olym. What with my open hand, or with it clench'd? Sta. Which you like best. Olym. Then take it; that's for you. [strikes him. Cle. What right have you to touch him? Olym. Why, my master, My Jupiter, commanded me to do it. Cle. [to Chalinus.] Return the blowâ [Chalinus strikes Olympio. Olym. My Jupiter, assist me! I shall be murder'dâ Sta. [to Chal.] How dare you to strike him? Cha. Because my Juno here commanded me. Sta. I must have patience since my wife is pleas'd While I'm alive to be my mistress. Cle. Why, I've the same right to speak to him, as you To speak to your Olympio. Olym. Why do you sully This my good omen? Sta. Of yourself take care, Chalinusâ Cha. Yes, when he has beat my teeth out. Sta. Come on, my dear, now let us draw our lots. You, be attentive thereâAnd you [to Cleostrata.] the same. Olym. I know not where I am! I can no more! My heart goes pit-a-pat: it dances so, 'Twill make its way, I fear, from out my breast. Cle. [putting her hand into the urn.] I've got hold of a lot. Sta. Well, draw it out then. Cha. Am I alive or dead? Olym. Come, shew it usâ 'Tis mine. Cha. That's a choak pear indeed. Cle. You've lost, Chalinusâ Sta. I rejoice, Olympio, That then we're to live longerâ Olym. Ay, that's owing To my own piety, added to that Of all my ancestorsâ Sta. Go in, my dear, And make all ready for the wedding. Cle. Yes, I'll do what you command me. Sta. You remember The village where he is to marry her, Is far off in the country. Cle. Yes, I know it. Sta. Go in, and tho' 'twill be concern to you, See it be done with care. Cle. It shall be so. [Exit. Sta. And let us too go in, and hasten them. Olym. Do I detain you, sir? Sta. When she was by, I did not chuse to say another wordâ [Exeunt Stalino and Olympio. Cha. 'Twould be lost labour now to hang myself; And more, would put me, too, to the expence Of purchasing a rope; and, add to all, 'Twould be a pleasure to my enemies. Why should a man, already dead as I am, Go hang himself? 'Tis fortune's fault, not mine, That I have lost. And now our Casina Is to be married to Olympio. Nor does it give me now so much concern That he has won, as to see Stalino So vehemently desire that I should miss her; And that Olympio should marry her. In what a fright he put himself! the wretch! What hurry was he in! And when Olympio Had won, how did he leap for joy! But hold, I'll go this way apartâI hear the door Opening; and forth are coming my good friends, [ironically.] And those who assist me wellâFrom this sly corner I will contrive some plot against them both. [goes apart. SCENE VII. Re-enter OLYMPIO and STALINO. Olym. Let him but once come to us in the country. [meaning Chalinus. I'll send the fellow back to you to town, Bearing his furca; and with stripes as black As any collier. Sta. That will be but right. Olym. I'll see it done. Sta. And, if he is at home, I fain would send him off to sup with you; And thus distress our enemy the more, By making this addition to his sorrow. Cha. [apart:] I'll, like a river crab, retire to the wall, And lie in wait to catch at their discourse. For one of them torments and tortures me, The other makes me pine and waste with envyâ The rascal's got his wedding-garment on, For stripes that receptacleâI defer My own deathâFor I am resolv'd to send Him first before me to the shades below. Olym. How I am found obsequious to your will! I have procur'd for you what most of all things You coveted.âThis day you will be blest, With the dear company of her you love; And that, without the knowledge of your wifeâ Sta. No moreâMay all the gods for ever be Propitious to me! but my lips will scarce Refrain from kissing you for these your services, My joy, my pleasure! Cha. [apart.] What is it that he means By kissing? What is this? What is't you mean By calling him your joy, your pleasure? Olym. What! You love me then? Sta. More than myself, I swear. Let me embrace thee. Olym. What! embrace me, sir? Chal. [apart.] By Hercules! he'll smother him I think. Olym. Stand off, sir lover, I am not your mistressâ You'll own how well I have obey'd your orders, And made myself subservient to your pleasure! Sta. So much so, I shall ever while I live Wish for your happiness, more than for my own. How happy shall I be this day with Casina! How many pleasures shall I now partake of, Without the knowledge of my wife! Cha. [apart.] Hah! Hah! I'm got at last in the right track I find. He is in love with Casina. Yes, yes, I have them both. Sta. By Hercules! I long, Earnestly long to kiss, and to embrace her. Olym. But let her first be brought out of the house, You're in a plaguy hurry sure! Sta. Why, I'm In love. Olym. I think it can't be done to-day. Sta. It can; if you but think 'tis in my power To-morrow to bestow your freedom on you. Cha. [apart.] Hah! I must listen now with both my ears. I now shall catch two boars in the same thicket. Sta. There's a place ready at a friend and neighbour's, I've trusted him with all my love, and he Has promis'd me a room convenient. Olym. But His wife? Where will his wife bestow herself? Sta. That too I've cleverly contriv'dâMy wife Will strait invite her hither to the wedding, To keep her company, to share her labour, And sleep with herâSuch orders have I given, And my wife too has told me, she'd complyâ She'll lie here at our house; and I'll take care Her husband shall not be at homeâDo you Pretend to take your wife into the country, His house shall be the country for so long, Until I've here consummated with Casina; And you to-morrow morn by break of day, Shall bear her off indeed into the country. Is it not well contriv'd? Olym. Oh! skilfully. Cha. [apart.] Go on thenâPlot, contriveâBy Hercules! Your stratagems shall turn to your confusion. Sta. Attend to what I now would have you do. Olym. Say onâ Sta. Here, take my purseâBegone, and haste To buy provisions for our entertainment. But I would have them nice and delicate, For she herself is delicate and nice. Olym. It shall be done. Sta. Be sure to buy some lobsters, Oysters and smeltsâ Cha. [apart.] And add some furmity If you are wise, and know what you're about. Sta. Some soles. Cha. [apart.] Or rather some old soles of shoes, To slap you in the face, filthy old fellow. Olym. Suppose some tongues? Sta. Not when my wife's at home: We want no tongue then, her's will ne'er be silent. Olym. When I'm upon the spot, I then can pick And chuse, and buy what seems to me the best. Sta. You're rightâAway! spare for no cost, provide In plentyâI must now go to my neighbour, And see that he takes care of what I've order'd. Olym. Shall I go now? Sta. Yes, now, away directly. [Exeunt Olympio and Chalino severally. CHALINUS comes forward. Cha. Had I three freedoms offer'd me directly, I'd not accept them, were I to forego The plot I'm planning 'gainst them, and not lay This whole affair quite open to my mistress. My foes I've plainly taken in the toilâ Now if my mistress will but do her duty, Our cause is all our ownâI now shall be Fairly before my chaps; the omens all Are on our side to-day: tho' just now conquer'd, We yet shall come off victors. I'll go in, And 'stead of what the other cook's provided, Dress in my turn another kind of dishâ The dish that's ready shan't be done enough; And what's not yet prepar'd, shall soon be ready. [Exit. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter STALINO and ALCESIMUS. STALINO. Now is the time that I shall know, Alcesimus, Whether you represent a friend or foe. The tryal's now on proof, the battle's join'd. Why do I love, you say? nay, blame me not: But cut that matter shortâMy head's too grey! Advanc'd in years! Besides, a married man! Cut short those matters too. Alc. I never saw A man in love, in a worse plight than you. Sta. Take care your house be empty. Alc. Troth, I'm fix'd To send my servants, men and maids, to you. Sta. You're perfectly adroit! But now remember The injunction given by Colax in the comedyâ Let each one hither bring his dish, as if To Sutrium he was goingâ Alc. I'll remember. Sta. Ordinance ne'er was better order'd; to you I leave itâI'm just going to the forum, And shall be back i'th'instantâ Alc. A good walk to you! Sta. See that your doors too have a tongue. Alc. Why so? Sta. When I come back, that they may ask me in. Alc. Strange that! you are a man to be corrected, You say your pleasure of us. Sta. Of what use Is it to be in love, unless we can Banter a little? But do you take care You're in the way when wanted. Alc. I shall be At home. [Exit Stalino. Alcesimus stands apart. SCENE II. Enter CLEOSTRATA. Cle. And was it then for this, by Castor! My husband press'd me with such earnestness To invite my neighbour to my house directly, That her's might be at liberty for him To introduce his Casina into? But I shan't press the invitation, Nor be the means of giving such old bell-weathers An opportunity to indulge their lusts. But see! look there, the pillar of the state, The prop of the republick coming hither, My neighbour, who would make an offer of His house, my husband to accommodate. That wit he has, was bought at no cheap rate. Alc. [coming forward.] I wonder much what can the reason be They have not yet sent over for my wife. She is at home quite dress'd, and waiting for them. But see! I think they now are come to call her. Good day, Cleostrataâ Cle. The like to you, AlcesimusâWhere is your wife? Alc. Within; And waiting your commandsâYour husband begg'd I'd send her to your house, in order that She might assist youâShall I call her to you? Cle. No matter: by no means, if she is busy. Alc. She is at leisure. Cle. Well, it is no matter. I would not willingly be troublesome. I'll call upon her at some future time. Alc. Are you not here preparing for a wedding? Cle. We're now about it. Alc. Do you then not want Assistance? Cle. No, we have enough at home. When every thing is ready for the ceremony, I'll call upon herâNow farewell, and pay My compliments unto her. Alc. Well, what now Is to be done? Unhappy as I am! I have embark'd me in a base affair, Only to oblige this vile, old, toothless goat, Who has engag'd me in'tâI've promis'd too, My wife to assist abroad, as puppies do. Then this old debauchee! who told me too His wife would ask mine over to his house: And now she tells me, she does not expect her. I should not be surpriz'd, by Pollux' temple! If after all, my neighbour here, Cleostrata, Should smell a ratâBut yet, on t'other side, When I consider this affair, should it Be so, she would apply herself to me. Well, I'll go in, and privily convey My vessel once more into dock. [Exit. Cle. In troth! He has been most finely play'd upon. How fast These pitiful old fellows hurry on, And to no purposeâNow I well could wish My good for nothing, old decrepid husband Would come along this way, that I might make A fool of him, just as I've done of t'other. 'Twould give me pleasure could I make them quarrel. But see, he's comingâLook upon his gravity, And you would take him for a sober man. [stands apart. SCENE III. Enter STALINO. Sta. In my opinion, 'tis a mighty folly For one who is in love, to think of going To any publick place, the very day His mistress is drest out in all her trim, And ready to receive him. Yet this folly Have I been guilty ofâI've spent the day, Standing to plead the cause of a relation; And I, by Hercules! am glad he has lost it, To teach him to chuse me another time To be his advocate. 'Tis necessary, When you would ask a friend to plead your cause, First to enquire, if his mind's at home, Or gone abroadâAnd, if the last, to send And fetch it home againâBut see, my wife Standing before our door! Wretch that I am! I'm desperately afraid she is not deaf, But has o'erheard what I've been talking of. Cle. [apart.] By Castor's temple! I have heard it all, And you shall find it to your cost. Sta. I'll go A little nearerâWhat are you about, [to her.] My joy? Cle. Waiting for you. Sta. All's ready then? What have you brought our neighbour to assist you? Cle. I have, as you desir'd, invited her. But this your crony, this best friend of yours, Why he should be so angry with his wife, I can't conceiveâWhen I invited her, He said he could not let her come to me. Sta. Ay, 'tis your greatest fault, you speak not mildlyâ Cle. 'Tis not the business of a virtuous wife, But of a courtezan, my dear, to wheedle. Do you go fetch her. I'll go in, and see What's to be done within, my soul. Sta. Make haste then. Cle. I willâI'll now throw in some fears, and make This goatish suitor here compleatly miserable. [Exit. SCENE IV. Enter ALCESIMUS. Alc. I'll now go see if this mad-headed lover, Who would bamboozle both my wife and me, Is come home from the forum. But behold, He's there before the doorâBy Hercules! Most opportunely am I coming to you. Sta. And so, by Hercules! am I to you. But what, unworthy man, have you to say? What was't I gave in charge to you? What was't I beg'd of you to do? Alc. Why, what's the matter? Sta. How well you've taken care your house should be Free for my use? How well you've sent your wife Home to our house? And are you not the cause I've lost so fair an opportunity? Alc. Go hang yourself. You said yourself, your wife Should call on me, and fetch mine over to you. Sta. She said she had done so: but you refus'd To let her come. Alc. And yet Cleostrata Herself declar'd she did not want her aid. Sta. But she herself has sent me to desire That she would come. Alc. I do not mind your but. Sta. But notwithstanding that, you ruin me. Alc. But that is well thenâBut I shall not part With this same but as yetâBut I'd be glad To make you angryâBut, and if I knew The way to do itâbut I'd do it freely. Yes, I will have as many buts as you; And now to sum up all your buts in one, But may the gods confound you! Sta. After all, Will you at last send your wife over to us? Alc. You may yourself conduct her; and may you, My wife and yours, nay, and your mistress too, Go and be hang'd togetherâNow march off, And let's attend to businessâI'll go order My wife to cross the garden, and give yours The meetingâ Sta. Now you are a friend indeed. [Exit Alc. Under what ill star'd omen, shall I say, This love has ta'en possession of my heartâ Or 'gainst the goddess Venus, what offence Have I committed, that so many crosses, Such accidents should thus obstruct my love? But what's that noise I hear within the house? SCENE V. Enter PARDALISCA. Par. Undone! undone! I'm ruin'd utterly! Frightned to death! my limbs sink under me. Where shall I find assistance or protection, Refuge or succour! What surprizing things Have I just seen within! such desperateness New and unusualâTake good care, Cleostrata, Care of yourself, keep from her, I beseech you; Lest in the transport of her rage, she do Some mischief to youâForce from her the sword; She is distractedâ Sta. What's the matter? why Does she run out, in such a fright, and seemingly Half dead with fear?âHola! there, Pardalisca. Par. I'm ruin'd! whence that voice which strikes my ears? Sta. Look on me thenâ Par. What, is it you, my master! Sta. What is the matter? What is't frightens you? Par. Oh! I'm quite spent. Sta. How spent? Par. Undone! And you're the same. Sta. What is the matter with you? Unfoldâ Par. Ah! woe be to youâ Sta. And the like To youâ Par. O dear! Support me, I shall fall. Sta. What can this be? Explain to me directly. Par. Oh! my heart fails me; be so good to make A little air, and fan me with your cloak. Sta. How this affair alarms me! I can't think What it can be; perhaps she may have put Too little water to her wine. Par. I beg you Hold tight my templesâ Sta. To the gallows with you! Your temples, head and heart, and all of you May the gods crush! For if you don't quick tell me What is the matter, I myself, you serpent, Will knock your brains out, who thus play upon me. Par. My master! Sta. Well, what would you have, my girl? Par. You are too angry. Sta. And you prate too much. But say what is this matterâSpeak in few: What's this disturbance here within the house? Par. Well, you shall know: attend then to this evil, This bad affair, this prank that your slave Casina Is playing in the house; and what is not According to the laws of the republick. Sta. What is it? Par. Fear does quite prevent my utterance. Sta. Of what? Can I not learn from you what sort Of business 'tis? Par. I'll tell you thenâThis Casina Whom you would marry to your bailiffâshe Within doorsâ Sta. What within doors? tell me what? Par. Is following the example of bad wives; And threats her husband. Sta. How is that? Par. Alas! Sta. What's that? Par. She says she'll take away his life. A swordâ Sta. Ha! Par. Yes, a swordâ Sta. What of that sword? Par. Holds in her handâ Sta. Ah! wretched me!âFor what! Par. Why she pursues all who're within the house, Won't let a soul come near her; so that all, Silent for fear, conceal themselves in chests, Or under beds.â Sta. Undone! without resource. What sudden ill is this befallen her? Par. She has lost her reasonâ Sta. I am the most wretched Of men. Par. Ah! if you knew what she has said To day. Sta. Why tell me then; what is't she said? Par. Attend: she swore by all the gods and goddesses, She'd this night murder him who was to lie with her. Sta. Murder me! Par. You! why how are you concern'd? Sta. Psha! psha! Par. Why what have you to do with her? Sta. 'Twas a mistake. I should have said my bailiff. Par. From the high road you turn out knowingly Into bye pathsâ Sta. But does she threaten me? Par. She's more averse to you than any body. Sta. Why so? Par. Because you'd marry her to Olympio. She swears nor you, nor he, nor she herself, Shall be alive to-morrow. I'm sent hither To tell you this; and caution you to guard Against her. [runs off. Sta. I am ruin'd quite! by Hercules! And sure there is not an old man in love, Nor ever was, so wretched as myself. Re-enter PARDALISCA. Par. [aside.] I play upon him cleverly; for all I've said has not one word of truth in it. My mistress and her neighbour here, concerted This scheme together, and dispatch'd me hither To play it off. Sta. Hola! there, Pardalisca! Par. Well, what's the matter now? Sta. There isâ Par. What is there? Sta. Something I want to examine you about. Par. You're only throwing hindrance in my way. Sta. And you, sorrow and grief in mineâBut say Has Casina still got a sword? Par. A sword?â Yes, twoâ Sta. How? two! Par. Yes, one to do your business; The other for your bailiffâ Sta. I'm a dead man, More so than any man that now is living. A coat of mail would be a proper thing To wrap myself up inâWhat did my wife? Did not she go, and take away her sword? Par. There's no one dar'd go near her. Sta. Yet she should Have spoke her fair. Par. She did so: but in vain; She would not part with it, unless she knew That she should not be married to the bailiff. Sta. Spite of her teeth, and for she does not chuse it, She shall be married, and this very day too. Why should I not compleat my undertaking, And get her married to me?âNot to me I meant; but to our bailiffâ Par. Very often You blunder thusâ Sta. All owing to my frightâ But prithee tell my wife, I beg she would Intreat her to lay down the sword, that I May go into my house. Par. I'll tell her so. Sta. Do you yourself intreat her too. Par. I will. Sta. But use soft words, as you are us'd to do. And do you mind me, if you should effect it, I will present you with a pair of slippers; Give you a gold ring for your finger too, And many more good things. Par. I'll do my best. Sta. Endeavour to succeed. Sta. I'll go directly, Unless ought should detain me. Sta. Get you gone then, And take good careâBut see, our eaterer [Exit Pardalisca. Comes with provisions, and his followers with him. SCENE VI. Enter OLYMPIO, a COOK, and his assistants. Olym. [to the Cook.] Take care, you thief, and see that your assistants, These briars here, march well under your banner. Cook. Why are they briars? Olym. Why, because whate'er They touch they bear away; and tear it strait To piecesâTo whatever place they come, Or wheresoe'er they are, with double loss They mulct their masters. Cook. Fie upon you! fie! Olym. But while I'm chattering here, I never think To meet my master, and put on an air Of some importance, as of quality; And with familiarity accost him. Sta. Good day to you, good man. Olym. Ay, very true. Sta. Well, what's the news? Olym. The news? Why you're in love; And I am hungry, and am thirsty too. Sta. You're marching well attended. Olym. Yes, to-dayâ Sta. But stay, however full you are of scorn. Olym. Foh! foh! your speeches smell unsavoury. Sta. What business urges you? Olym. This business, sirâ [pointing to the provisions. Sta. What, won't you stop a bit? Olym. I've other things To mindâYou're troublesomeâ Sta. If you do not stop I shall bestow upon you what you'll like not. Olym. Great Jove! I prithee get thee farther off, Unless you'd wish to have me take a puke. Sta. Stop thenâ Olym. The matter? say, Who is this man? Sta. I am your master. Olym. You? What master, fellow? Sta. Why him to whom you're slave. Olym. How, I a slave? Sta. Yes, and my slave. Olym. What, am I then not free? Call that to mind again; have you forgot? Sta. Stop, and stay here. Olym. Let me alone. Sta. I am Your slave. Olym. Ay, there's some sense in thatâ Sta. I beg My little dear Olympio, father! patron! Olym. That's good! you now in troth have found your wisdom. Sta. I'm at your service quite. Olym. What need have I Of so untoward a servantâBut what now? Sta. What dainty fare you'll give me by-and-by? Olym. If supper was but drest. Sta. Let 'em go in then. Olym. Quick, haste, go in directly, and dispatchâ Sta. I'll presently be with youâSee, at supper That there be wine enoughâFor I would fare Deliciously, not imitate barbarians. Go inâ[to the Cook.] I'll stay a little longer here. 'Tis said, that Casina has got a sword Within, to take away my life and yoursâ [to Olympio. Olym. I know itâLet her have oneâ'Tis no more Than a meer jokeâI know them both, I tell you, A pretty piece of goods they are. However, Do you go in with me. Sta. Yet notwithstanding, By Pollux! I am fearful of some mischief. Do you go first, and see what's doing there. Olym. My life's as dear to me, as yours to you. Sta. But I desire you'd only go alongâ Olym. I'll go along with you, if you command me. [Exeunt. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter PARDALISCA. PARDALISCA. In troth I think that neither at Nemea, Olympia, nor elsewhere, were e'er exhibited Such pleasant games as we have had within With our old gentleman and our Olympio. The house is all in motionâThe old man Making a bawling in the kitchen, and Urging the cooksâWhat is it you're about All day?âWhy don't you serve us something up? If you have any thing to serve, be quick; The supper ought to have been quite ready nowâ Then here on t'other side, Olympio; A wreath upon his head, and cloath'd in white, Strutting about like some one of importance. And then the women in the bed-chamber, Dressing Chalinus up in women's cloaths, To make him pass for Casina; and give him To our Olympio as a bride. But then They very cleverly dissemble, and Conceal from him how this affair's to endâ Mean time the cooks are worthily employ'd, Ingeniously contrive, and do their utmost To hinder the old gentleman from suppingâ They throw the pots down, and upon the fire Pour waterâThis is done at the request Of our two mistresses, whose wish it is To turn the old man out of doors, without His supper, that they may be left alone To stuff themselves; for I well know them both For gluttons; and that when they have to eat They gormandize. But some one opes the door. SCENE II. Enter STALINO [speaking to CLEOSTRATA within.] Sta. You and the rest, my dear, I think had best, When it is ready, sit you down to supper. I, for my part, shall eat mine in the country; For I'm desirous to attend the bride And bridegroom, lest some evil minded persons Should bear her off: in such an age as this, I know that men have bad designs. Indulge Your appetitesâBe merry; but be sure You send away Olympio and Casina In time, in order that we may get there While it is lightâI will be back to-morrow, And then, my dear, I'll have a feast with you. Par. [aside.] 'Tis as I said it would beâThey have turn'd The old man out of doors without his supper. Sta. [to Par.] What is it you are doing here? Par. I'm going Whither my mistress sent meâ Sta. Really? Par. Yes, really. Sta. What are you looking for? Par. I look for nothing, troth! Sta. Well get you gone. You're loitering here, when all within are busy. Par. I'm gone. Sta. Avaunt! begone, you jade of jades! [Exit Pardalisca. Sta. Is she quite gone? She isâThen I may have My tongue at liberty. A man in love, Tho' he is hungry, does not think of eating, By Hercules! But see there my companion, My new associate, brother married man Is coming hither; on his head, a wreath; And in his hand, a torchâ SCENE III. Enter OLYMPIO, as STALINO had described him, with MINSTRELS. Olym. Pipers, come on; And, while they hither lead the new made bride, Play a soft hymenÃ¦al, nuptial air; Make the whole street resound. Sing, Io, Hymen! Io, Hymen! HymenÃ¦e! Io, Hymen! [singing.] Sta. How fare you, my preserver? Olym. Very hungry, By Hercules! and therefore not so thirsty. Sta. But I am in love. Olym. I shall do nought, O love, To bring your empire into danger; no, My inwards grumble; and with emptiness. Sta. Why this delay within? 'tis done on purpose: The more I haste myself, the slower are they. Olym. Suppose I serenade them with a song? Sing HymenÃ¦e to them? Sta. 'Twould not be AmissâI'll join you, as we both are married. Olym. and Sta. Io, Hymen! HymenÃ¦e! Io, Hymen! [singing. Sta. Oh! I am gone; poor I have burst my lungs With singing Hymen! Hymen! HymenÃ¦e! If I was running now the race I'd wish To run, I never could hold outâ Olym. By Pollux! Was you a horse, you never would be tam'd. Sta. Why so? and for what reason? Olym. You're too resty. But the door creaksâOh! ho! they're coming out. Sta. The gods preserve me! all goes very well. I at a distance smell out Casina. SCENE IV. Enter two WOMEN SLAVES leading out CHALINUS dress'd in women's cloaths for CASINA. Wom. Over the threshold lift your feet a little, New married bride, and prosperously begin Your journey, that you may survive your husband; In power be his superior, get the better, And come off conqueror. May you still maintain Your empire over him: And may your husband Find you in cloaths, and may you plunder him Both night and day, behave to him with cunning. Remember that, I pray you. Olym. Yes, by Hercules! If she does so, she'll do it to her cost. [aside.] Sta. Peace! hold your tongue. Olym. I will not hold my tongue. Sta. What is the matter? Olym. Why those cursed jades there, Are teaching her such wicked lessons, sir. Sta. Undone! When all is ready, they're for making Each thing as if it was not done at all. Ay, that's their aim: they'd undo all again. Wom. Olympio, when you please, receive your wife From these our hands. [presenting Chalinus to him for Casina.] Olym. If you've a wife to give, Why give her me. Sta. Return into the house. [to the women. Wom. Prithee for goodness sake, deal gently with her, She's but a novice. Olym. I'll take care. Adieu! Sta. Begone. Wom. Adieu! [Exeunt. Sta. Well, are they gone at last? Olym. Your wife's at home: fear nothing. Sta. Then, huzza! By Pollux! I'm now free at lastâMy honey! [to Cha. supposing him Casina. My little flower! Olym. Hola! there, take care If you are wiseâShe's mineâ Sta. I know it well, But I may first be kind to her. Olym. Hold this torch. Sta. I'd rather much hold her within my arms. [embracing the pretended Casina. Venus, all powerful goddess, you have made My life quite happy, by bestowing on me The enjoyment of so delicate a charmer. Olym. My pretty little wife hereâ [embracing her. Sta. What's the matter? Olym. âHas trod upon my toes. Sta. As 'twere jocoselyâ No falling dew feels half so soft as she. Olym. By Pollux' temple, what a handsome neck! Undone! Undone! [Cha. strikes him. Sta. Why, what's the matter now? Olym. She strikes me with her elbow on my breast. Sta. Why do you handle her so roughly then? I touch her gently, so she strikes not me. Olym. Ah, ah! Sta. The matter! Olym. Plague! how strong she is! She has with her elbow almost knock'd me downâ Sta. That's but a sign she would retire to rest. Olym. Then let's go inâ Sta. My pretty, precious dear! [Exeunt. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter MYRRINA and PARDALISCA. PARDALISCA. Now that we've well been entertain'd within, Let's see this wedding sport here out of doors. Myr. I swear by Castor's temple, I ne'er laugh'd More heartily in all my days; and think, In those to come, I never shall exceed itâ I'd fain know how Chalinus acts his part Of bride with his new bridegroomâSure no poet Did e'er contrive so crafty a device, As this contriv'd by usâPleas'd shall I be To see the old fellow, with his chaps well beaten, Come sallying forth; than he is, one more wicked Ne'er liv'd I think: and yet that other too, Who so officiously lent him his house, Is pretty near as badâHere, Pardalisca, Stand here; that when he sallies forth, we may Have our own sport with him. Par. I will, with pleasure, As I am wont to doâ Myr. Observe from hence What's going on within doors. Par. Stand behind me, I beg you. Myr. Speak then freely and with confidence Whatever comes into your head. Par. Peace, peace! Your door creaksâ [they stand apart. SCENE II. This Scene we have been obliged to curtail very much; and to omit several passages which could not even be imitated, much less translated, with the least regard to propriety or decency. Enter OLYMPIO and CLEOSTRATA, following him at a distance. Olym. Whither to fly, or where to hide myself, Or how I shall conceal this vile disgrace I know notâCan my master, or can I Survive the infamy of these our nuptialsâ I'm so asham'd, am so beside myself, To think we both shall be the common town talkâ Attend and you shall hear my wedding feats; [to the spectators. They're worth your hearing, and will make you laugh Most heartily, I fancy! when you know All that has past within; 'tis so ridiculous That you must burst with laughter at the taleâ As soon as I had brought this spouse of mine Into the chamber, first I bolt the doorâ Myr. [to Cleo.] See there Olympio isâAccost him strait. Cle. Where's your new bride? For heaven's sake inform me. Olym. [aside.] I'm lostâAll's blownâ Cle. Come, tell us all in order, As it has pass'd within: You'll give us pleasure. Olym. I can't for shame relate it. Cle. We must have it Exactly as it pass'dâ Olym. I cannot, shame forbids To tell such privaciesâ Cle. Come, tell us roundly All, and begin your story from the time You and your bride were bolted in together. Olym. When then I call'd her Casina, my Casina, My darling bride, why do you spurn your husband? Indeed 'tis not well done, to treat me thus, Me, who to all have given you the preferenceâ She answers not a wordâI then attempted To kiss her, mark ye; but I find a beard Against my lips, quite prickly, stiff as bristles. At length she kicks my stomach with such force, I tumble backward from the bed; and she Jumps out upon me, and bemauls my face With both her fists most heartilyâAt last I steal away in silence, in this trim You see me inâHeaven grant! at least, my master May drink of the same cup that I have tasted. Cle. 'Tis excellent indeed! But where's your cloak? Olym. My cloak's within doorsâYes, I left it there. Cle. Well, think you not our business well conducted? Olym. Yes truly, I deserve it. Cle. Hark! The doors Are opening surelyâ Olym. Sure she will not follow me. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Enter STALINO. Sta. A pretty business this! I know not what To say to this same wife; or how to look Upon herâQuite undone! The matter's all Come out beyond evasion. I am fairly Hook'dâhook'd fast How to patch up a story to my wifeâ My cloak too gone 'sdeath! these clandestine pranks I judge it best Yes, she indeed might calm my wife's resentment. But who would undertake this task I know not. I know not what to do: except I follow The example of bad slaves, and fly the house: If I return, no safety for my shoulders. I may frame sham excuses there: but all In vain; for she'll see thro' them in an instant. I shall smart for't deservedly, 'tis true; But sore against my willâYes, I'll be gone, Take to my heelsâ Olym. [from within.] Ho! Stalino, you lover! Sta. I'll make as if I heard not, and march offâ [Exit. SCENE IV. Enter CLEOSTRATA, MYRRINA, CHALINUS in women's cloaths disguis'd like CASINA, OLYMPIO, and the two women slaves. Cha. Where are you, you who aim at strict severity Of morals, you philosopher? By Hercules! 'Tis over with youâHere, come here, approach. Sta. Yes, I'll go this wayâ'Twere a better omen To have an o'ergrown puppy barking at me. Cle. What art thee doing here, my precious love, My little dear! and why too in this dress? Where is the stick, and where the cloak thee had'st? Wom. Lost in the battle both of them, I trow, When he was making love to Casina. Sta. 'Tis over with me! Cha. What, shall we to bed? 'Tis I am Casinaâ [discovering himself. Sta. Go and be hang'd, You scoundrel you!â Cha. Do you not love me then? Cle. Why don't you answer me? Where is your cloak? Sta. Bacchant! A Bacchant! Yes, by Hercules! You are a Bacchant, wife. Wom. He jokes on purpose. 'Tis not the feast of Bacchus now. Sta. 'Tis true, I had forgotâYet notwithstanding that You are a Bacchant. Cle. What d'you mean by Bacchant? That cannot beâ Olym. Yet you are in a fright, By Castor's temple! Sta. I in a fright, d'you say? Olym. Don't tell a lyeâThe matter's very plain. Sta. And won't you hold your tongue? Olym. By Hercules! I won't. Yourself most earnestly conjur'd me To ask for Casina to be my wife. Sta. That was an instance of the love I bore you. Cle. Rather an instance of your love to her. You're fairly caught. Sta. What, am I guilty then Of what you say? Cle. And do you ask that question? Sta. If I've done so, I've been to blame, by Hercules! Cle. Come in with me then; if you have forgot, I will refresh your memory. Sta. By Hercules! I think you rather are to be believ'd. Forgive your husband then, my dearâMyrrina, Intreat Cleostrata to pardon me. If, from this time I e'er love Casina, Or ever offer to seduce her more, Or ever more attempt to do the like, There is no cause, but you shall tuck me up, And with your own hands scourge me heartily. Myr. 'Tis my opinion that you should forgive him. Cle. I'll do as you would have meâAnd I pardon This folly in you, the more willingly, In order not to lengthen out the Comedy, Too long already. Sta. You're not angry then? Cle. No, I am not. Sta. May I depend upon it? Cle. You mayâ Sta. And can there in the world be found A wife more amiable than mine? Cha. Then take her. Cle.
