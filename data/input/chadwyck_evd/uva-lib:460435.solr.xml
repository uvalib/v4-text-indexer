      <field name="fulltext">? Pudicum Perdidit Hippolytum non fœlix cura Pudoris. Ausonius Edyll. 15.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis Personæ. Hippolytus, Son to Theseus by Antiope or Hippolyta Queen of the Amazons. Theseus, King of Athens, Father of Hippolytus. Phædra, Queen of Athens, Wife to Theseus, Mother-in-law to Hippolytus. Nurse to Phædra. Nuncius. Chorus. MUTES. Huntsmen. Maids to Phædra. Servants. SCENE Athens, and the Country adjoining.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGUMENT. Hippolytus, averse to Venus Joys, In Sylvan Pleasures his chast Life employs. Phædra his Bed incestuously desires, Plots to enjoy it, is rejected. Fires Of Love then turn'd to Hate. A Rape she feigns, Lays to his charge. This Faith with Theseus gains. Young Hippolyte flies, rash Curses after sent, The flying Youth with a sad Death prevent. Which known to Phædra, struck with deep Remorse, She with his Sword Life from her Breast doth force.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. Enter HIPPOLYTUS with Huntsmen, preparing for the Chace. HIPPOLYTUS. Go, you the shady Woods beset, You tall Cecropius Summit beat With nimble Feet; those Plains some try Which under stony Parnes lie. And those the River with swift Waves Roll'd through Thriasian Vallies laves. Climb you those lofty Hills still white With cold Riphæan Snows, their Flight Some others take, where stands the Grove With spreading Alders interwove, Where ly the Fields which the Spring's Sire, The soft'ring Zephyre, doth inspire With balmy Breath, when to appear He calls the Vernal Flowers, and where Meander-like, 'bove Agra's Plains, Through Pebbles calm Ilissus strains His Course, whose hungry Waters eat Away his barren Banks. You beat On the Left-hand, where Marathon The way does open to the Down. Where nightly the wild Herds along Unto their Forage lead their young. You tow'rd the rough Acharnans run, Seated against the Southern Sun, Whose warm Beams Winter's Rigour slack. For sweet Hymetius Quarries make Some others. You pursue the path To small Aphidnæ, that part hath Been long untrac'd, where to a Reach Sunion th'Embayed Shore doth stretch. Whom Sylvan Glories do excite, Lo, Phibalis doth him invite: There by many a Wound well known, The Terror of the labouring Clown, Lodges a Boar: slack you the Line To those still Hounds there, but confine Those fierce Molossians to their Chain. Those Cretan Bitches, let them strain Their tougher Leash, with Necks whose Hair Is worn, by frequent struggling, bare. Those fiery Spartans ('tis a bold Race, and greedy of their Prey) hold Shorter up; the hollow Rocks shall round E'er long with their full Cries resound: Now with sagacious Nose inclin'd Snuff they the Air, and seek to find Their Game, whilst yet the Scent lies hot, And the dew'd Earth retains the Slought Of Feet, ere Day-light 'gins t'appear. Some one on charged Shoulders bear The corded Toils some help to set With nimble Speed the close-maesh'd Net. Some, with vain Terror to confine The rowz'd Game, pitch the red-plum'd Line. Take you a light Dart; you a large Boar-Spear, and that with both hands charge. You close conceal'd in Ambush lie, And fright with Noise the Beasts that fly Into the Toils. You of the Prey, When we have kill'd, shall take the 'Say. To thy Companion, O Divine Virago! now Success assign. Thou, who Earth's solitary parts Thy Empire mak'st: whose sure aim'd Darts Those Beasts feel cold Araxis drink, Those sport on frozen Ister's Brink. Getulian Lions who subdues, Whose Hand Cretæan Harts pursues; And now does slighter Wounds impose Upon the swiftly flying Roes. Tygers to thee present their Breasts; Swift-footed Elgs, with shaggy Crests, To thee their Backs: and fiercer Bulls Arm'd with large Horns on their rough Sculls. What Beast soever there remains, Whether in the deserted Plains, Which the poor Garamantian knows. Those the rich Arabs Woods inclose, Or Pyrenæan Hills conceal, Whome'er Hyrcanian Lawns reveal, Or those the wand'ring Sarmats see, Great Goddess! dread thy Shafts and Thee. If with due Rites thy Sylvan Pow'r The grateful Votary implore, The Toils retain th'intangled Prey, Nor strugling Feet through Nets break way; But home he comes, whilst his Wain's Back Does with the loaded Quarry crack, And every Hound up to the Eyes In Blood his greedy Snout bedies. Whilst to their Homes the Rural Train Return in Triumph back again. Lo! the kind Goddess proves our Friend! The Hounds, I hear, their loud Mouths spend; The Huntsmen call. This way I'll take, That I the shorter Cut may make. Scene II. Enter Phædra and her Nurse. PHÆDRA. O Crete! thou mighty Empress of the Main, Whose num'rous Fleets the charged Seas sustain. Along each Coast; far as with pervious Tides Unto Assyrian Lands blue Nereus glides. Why in a hated home? Wise to my Foe, A wretched Life, drawn out in Tears and Wo, Compell'st thou me to lead? my wand'ring Spouse Hath left me; still his old Faith Theseus shows. Who to irremeable Styx is gone With bold Pirithous a Companion, And an Assistant to his mad Design, From Pluto's Throne to ravish Proserpine. Nor Fear nor Shame could hold him, but he must In Hell go seek new matter for his Lust. A greater Grief does yet my Soul oppress, Nor silent Night nor Slumber can release My Heart from Cares; the nourisht Ill still grows, And burns within; as that Fire's Tide that flows In Ætna's Caves. My curious Web no more Affects me now: my Spindle, which before Ius'd, now 'twixt my careless Hands falls down: Nor do my votive Gifts the Altars crown: Nor with Athenian Dames in mixed Quires, Toss I in silent Rites the conscious Fires: Nor Sacrifice, nor my chast Pray'rs present Unto the Land's adjudged President. All my Joys now to course the rowzed Deer, And with my soft Hand dart a rugged Spear. O whither tend'st thou, my besotted Mind? Why madly lov'st the Woods? Ah! now I find My wretched Mother's fatal Curse: now we Have learn'd to sin in Woods as well as she. I pity thee, poor Mother! that did'st prove The uncouth Fury of so strange a Love As that of a Wild Bull: he fierce disdain'd The Yoke, and o'er th'untam'd Herd proudly reign'd; Yet he lov'd something: but these Flame of ours What Dædalus, or what Celestial Pow'rs Can e'er befriend? Not if again that fam'd Mopsopian Artist, who the Labyrinth fram'd T'inclose the Minotaur should hither fly, Could he t'our Woes a Remedy apply. Venus, incens'd against Sol's hated Race, Seeks to revenge on us that known Disgrace Of Mars and her insnar'd; with Infamy Still loading the whole Stock, none e'er scap'd free Of Minos Race: their Loves have ever been, Notorious by the Adjunct of some Sin. Nu. O Theseus Royal Consort! Jove's bright Seed! This Ill from thy chast Breast expel with speed, These Flames extinguish; nor to Hopes accurst Give up thy yielding Soul: who at the first Resists Love's Charge, comes off a Victor still; But he who sooths and nurses the sweet Ill Too late, alas! the Yoke denies to bear Himself assum'd: and how averse to hear Truth told are Princes, we well know, and find With what Reluctancy to right inclin'd. Fall yet what may, I'll bear't, nor Truth disguise: Freedom at hand my weak Age fortifies. “'Tis the first step from Sin, to have the Will, “T'oppose, next Shame, to know a mean in Ill. Wretch whither tendst thou? why dost aggavate Thy House's Shame? and and foil thy Mother's Fate, By Crimes 'bove Monsters? for to our Manners we “Our Ills impute; Monsters to Destiny. If 'cause thy Husband breaths not this World's Air, Thou think'st thy Faults from Fears secured are, Thou art deceiv'd: say Pluto Theseus keeps Perpetual Prisoner in Lethæan Deeps; Think'st thou that he who o'er the wide-stretch'd Main Extends his Empire, and beneath whose Reign An hundred Cities stoop, thy Father, will Let undetected pass so great an Ill? Believe it not; “Parents are quicker Ey'd, “More wisely careful: say yet we could hide By subtil Craft thy Crime; yet what shall he By whose bright Beams all thing enlight'ned be, Thy radiant Grandsire? or what he who shakes The Heav'ns, and with Ætnæan Thunder rakes, The Gods great Father? canst thou draw a Skreen 'Twixt these all-seeing Judges and thy Sin? Suppose yet they should with thy Crime dispense, And Faith assur'd (deny'd each great Offence) Wait on thy' incestuous Pleasures; yet what Pain Is't, of a guilty Conscience to sustain The waking Horror! and a Soul o'er-laid With its own Crimes, and of it self afraid! “Some safely may, none e'er secure did sin. Repress this impious Love: a Crime ne'er seen, In the most barbarous Lands: a Sin unknown To wand'ring Getes, to those who Taurus crown Inhabit, or wild Scythians that dwell In scatter'd Tents. This horrid Guilt expel From thy chast Breast; and of thy Mothers Fires Mindful, abhor such new and strange Desires. Would'st by the Son's the Father's Bed pollute? Swell thy curst Womb with some mishapen Fruit? With thy foul Lust, go, invert Nature then. Why want there Monsters? or thy Brother's Den Why unsupply'd? so oft the World shall hear Of Prodigies, so often Nature bear The breach of her own Laws, as Cretan Dames Shall feel their Hearts incens'd with amorous Flames. Phæ. I must confess 'tis true thou tell'st me, Nurse, But forc'd by Passion, I pursue the worse. Headlong to Ruine runs my knowing Mind, Which oft turns back, but vainly, Help to find. So when against the Tide the Sailor toils To force his loaded Bark, the Current foils His Pains, down Stream the master'd Vessel's drove. My Reason's conquer'd by more powerful Love, Who rules as Tyrant in my captiv'd Breast. This winged God does Heav'n and Earth infest. With all-o'er-mast'ring Flames Jove's self he scorches, Mars more than Fire-Pikes dreads his little Torches. The God who three-fork'd Thunder frames, who toils, Unswelter'd in Ætnæan Forges, broils In his small Fires. Phœbus who bears the Fame For Archery, this Boy with surer Aim Tranfixes: through the Earth and ample Skies A winged Plague to Men and Gods, he flies. Nur. Depraved Appetite, that Bawd to Vice, Made Love a God: and for his freer Rise, Did to this Fury a false Pow'r assign Fancying, o'er all the World how Erycine Her wand'ring Boy sends, how to Heav'n he flies, There shoots his Shafts; among the Deities Greatest tho least; “Wild Heads these Follies feign'd, “So Love his Bow, her Pow'r so Venus gain'd. “Whoe'er too great Prosperity enjoys, “Floating in Luxury, vain Novelties “Affecting, him dire Lust (that never fails “T'attend on ample Fortunes) soon assails. “No common Dainties, nor no House, tho neat, “If meanly built, can please, nor courser Treat. “O why from homely Cottages abstains “This Plague, and in our princely Mansions reigns? “Or why alone in poor and humble Cells, “And not in Courts, religious Venus dwells? “Why do the common sort of People prove “Honest Affections and restrained Love? “When those with Riches and with Empire crown'd “Unto their vast Desires prescribe no bound; “Above their Pow'rs the Great in Pow'r aspire, “Would by their Wills Impossibles acquire. Thou seest what for thy Royal State is best; Fear thy returning Husband's Pow'r at least. Phæ. In me Love's greater Tyranny does reign. I fear no Man's Return: none e'er again Trod the Earth's Convex, or return'd to Light From those still Deeps where dwells eternal Night. Nur. Believe not this: tho Dis shut up his Court, And Stygian Cerberus watch at the Port, Theseus can Ways deny'd to others find. Phæ. Perhaps he'll pardon this our Love. Nur. Unkind To a chast Wise he was; Antiope His cruel Hand felt; but suppose that he Should be appeas'd; yet who can e'er reclaim The other's Mind? that hates the very Name Of Woman; leads a single Life; does shun The Marriage-Bed; born of an Amazon You may perceive he was. Phæ. Yet him o'er Hills Topt with the Snow, and with his nimble Heels Beating rough Crags, thro' Woods, o'er Mountains, I With Joy could follow. Nur. Think'st he'll e'er apply Himself to thee, or Love's Caresses know, For unchast Venus his chast Rites forego; Hop'st thou he'll e'er love thee, who for thy sake Perhaps hates all thy Sex? Phæ. Will not Pray'rs make His Mind relent? Nur. He's fierce. Phæ. Fierce things have been Yet tam'd by Love. Nur. He'll fly. Phæ. We'll follow him. Tho through the Seas. Nur. To mind thy Father call. Phæ. And Mother too. Nur. He hates your Sex. Phæ. We shall Then fear no Rival. Nur. Thy returning Spouse. Phæ. Who? the Companion of Pirithous. Nur. Thy Father too. Phæ. Kind Ariadne's Sire. Nur. By these Hairs Age hath silver'd, I desire, This Bosom worn with Cares, these Breasts once dear To thee, give check unto thy wild Career, And thy own Succour prove: “'tis to the Mind “Some part of Cure, to be for Cure inclin'd. Phæ. No more, good Nurse, I yeild: nor hath my Breast All Shame abandon'd. Love! I'll do my best If thou'lt not bow, to break thee. No Defame Shall ever blemish my unspotted Name. There's but one Remedy; on that we're bent: Follow thy Spouse; thy Sin by Death prevent. Nur. Suppress these Thoughts: th'art worthy to enjoy Life, 'cause thou think'st thy self worthy to die. Phæ. No, Nurse; my Death's unalterably set: Only the kind is undetermin'd yet. Whether Sword, Halter, Precipice, shall be My End, is unresolv'd: but, Chastity, We'll fall thy Sacrifice. Nur. And shall I see And suffer thee to perish willfully? O check this wilder Fury. Phæ. “To restrain Death, that's decreed and due, all Reason's vain. Nur. If then (thou only Comfort of my Age!) Thy Soul be master'd with so strong a Rage, Regard not Fame: “Fame's but a Liar still, “Bad to the Good, and good unto the Ill. Let's try this froward Youth: the Task be mine To work his stubborn Will to yield to thine. CHORUS. Goddess! whose Birth from rough Seas came, Whom Mother the Twin Cupids name: His powerful Flames subduing Hearts, How sure that childish Wanton darts, And with an Aim unerring deals! Into the melting Marrow steals The theivish Fire, and of their Food Robs th'Azure Conduits of the Blood; No sign the secret Wound betrays, But on the wasted Spirits prays. No Truce there is 'twixt him and Hearts, O'er the whole World he flings his Darts. Who the Sun's Rise, who his Set sees, Whom the South scorcheth, North does freeze, All feel the Fervour of his Fires. He Youth with wilder Flames inspires, And in decrepid Age repeats The Ardor of their languish'd Heats. He Virgins immaturer Breasts With strange unknown Desires infests: And Gods constrains, leaving the Skies, To trace the Earth in a Disguise; Sol Herdsman turn'd, in Thessaly Fed Cattel, and, his Harp laid by, With Pipe of Reeds uneven made His Bullocks to their Pasture plaid. How oft yet under meaner Shrouds Mask'd hath he been, who Heav'ns and Clouds Guides with his Hand? with Silver Wings Now like a Swan he seems, and sings More sweetly than they dying use. Now he a Bull's fierce shape indues, And his smooth Back, whilst one ascends, Unto the sportive Virgins bends. Then through his Brother's Waves, untry'd Before, (whilst Oars his Feet supply'd) He Victor swims; with fearful Eyes Regarding still his beauteous Prize. Dark Night's bright Goddess fir'd, her Sphere Forsaking, to her Brother's Care Her Silver Chariot leaves to guide: He in a less Round learns to ride, And drive the Two hors'd Coach of Night, Which now no due Course keeps; the Light Slowlier returning, 'cause that feels A Weight too heavy for its Wheels. Alcmena's Great Son threw aside His Shafts, and threatning Lion's Hide. With Em'rauld Rings his Fingers grac'd, His rough Hairs in due order plac'd. On's Legs did Gold-wrought Buskins try, On's Feet did yellow Sandals tie, And with that Hand, which us'd to ply His conqu'ring Mace, that Monsters slew, He Threads with quick-turn'd Spindle drew. The Persian, and the fertile Land Of Lydia, pow'rful in Command. (Disrob'd of his fierce Lion's Skin) Hath on his mighty Shoulders seen (On which Heaven's Fabrick once was born) A slight-weav'd Tyrian Mantle worn. These Fires, if wounded Hearts say true, Are sacred, and do all subdue. The Earth which the salt Seas imbrace, The Heavens which glittering Stars inchace, Under the cruel Tyranny Of this blind Boy subjected lie. Whose Shafts, inevitable, seize Upon the blue Nereides; Nor can the Waters of the Main The Fervour of his Fires restrain. The winged People of the Sky No less his powerful Flames do try. When Venus does their Bloods excite, How Bulls do for their Heifers fight! Faint Harts, when their Hinds Love they doubt, To Combat call their Rivals out, And signs, by braying, to their Foe Of their conceived Fury show. The swarthy Indian then no more Dares spotted Tygers chase; the Boar Whetting his angry Tusks, does roam, And froths his Jaws with a white Foam. The Libyan Lions shake their Manes, When in their Breast his Fury reigns. And with their fiercer Roarings make The Forests groan, the Ground to quake. The Horror of the Sea, the Whale; And Elephant his Fires assail. All bow to Natures Laws, there's none Exempt. All Enmity's o'erthrown At Love's Command, in whose kind Fires Hate, tho inveterate, expires. What need we instance more, when Love Can Hearts of cruel Stepdames move.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Scene I. Enter CHORUS and NURSE. CHORUS. O speak, dear Nurse, what News? where is the Queen? Is no Abatement of her Passion seen? Nur. No Hope as yet appears, or to asswage, Or put an end to her Distempers Rage. She fries in secret Fires, and tho she'd hide Her smother'd Grief, 'tis by her Looks descry'd. Her Eyes shoot Flames; she loaths the Light should see Her meagre Cheeks, with nothing pleas'd can be, Perplex'd with Passions strange Variety. In fainting Fits she often falls as dead, Scarce can her feeble Neck support her Head. To Rest she goes, yet Sleep she cannot taste, But in Complaints the tedious Night does waste. Commands to be set up, then in her Bed Laid down again: now bids them dress her Head, Anon undress the same; unapt to bear With Patience ought; likes nothing long to wear. No Care or of her Food or Health retains; Feebly she creeps about; nor now remains Her former Vigour, nor that blushing Grace Which gave a beauteous Tincture to her Face. Care macerates her Limbs; trembling she goes; Her comely Mein and Port quite lost: nor does Her Eye, which late with Lustre, as a Sign Of her bright Race, now ought Phœbeian shine. Tears trickle down her pallid Cheeks, still wet With a continual Show'r; as when the Heat Assails high Taurus Crown, the Mountain flows With tepid Currents of dissolved Snows. But see the Royal Palace is displaid, Where on her golden Couch behold her laid, Leaning upon her Arm: whilst her own Cloaths And Princely Habits her sick Fancy loaths. PHÆDRA lying on a Couch. Maids, take those Richer Garments from my Eye; Hence with those Robes that shine with Tyrian Dye; And Vests of Silk by Eastern Seres wrought On Boughs of Trees, from Lands far distant brought. A shorter Zone my tuckt up Garments bind, No Carcanet my Neck, nor Pearls of Inde Adorn my charged Ears; No Odors spread Or rich Assyrian Perfumes on my Head. So 'bout my Neck let my loose Hairs hang down In careless order, and my Shoulders crown; That as I run they with the Wind may play: My Left-hand shall my shogging Quiver stay, My Right shall brandish a Thessalian Spear, Such my stern Love's fair Mother did appear, When she, forsaking the cold Pontick Strands, With Tanaitick and Mæotick Bands, Made Cavalcado's o'er the Attick Lands. A crescent Shield flanking her tender side, Her Hair now loose, in knotted Curls now ty'd. Drest in this manner to the Woods I'll fly. Nur. Cease these sad Plaints; “Grief cures not Misery. Phæ. Can ought my cruel Griefs or ease, or end! Nur. Let's pray the Virgin Huntress would befriend. [Exit Phædra. Manet Nurse, who, on the behalf of Phædra, offers Supplications and Sacrifice to Diana or Hecate. NURSE. Hail the Woods Queen! the only Deitie Honour'st the Hills, which only honour thee; These sad and threatning Omens of her Heart, Great Goddess of the Groves! to good convert. Bright Lamp of Heav'n! thou Ornament of Night! That chear'st the World with thy alternate Light. Three-formed Hecate! O be inclin'd T'our Pray'rs! and bow Hippolytus stern Mind. To love now let him learn, and be inflam'd With mutual Fires; be his fierce Heart reclaim'd, And stoop to Venus Laws; to this wish'd End, Adored Goddess! all thy Pow'rs intend. So shine thy Looks with Lustre ever bright, And break through the obscuring Clouds by Night With Silver Horns. So Charms thee never force To leave thy Sphere, nor interupt thy Course. So never Shepherd boast thee for his Prize. Come, O invok'd! and this our Sacrifice Accept. Behold the Goddess does assent. [Enter Hippolytus. I see him, with religious Intent, His sacred Rites performing all alone. What doubt'st? see Fortune Time and Place hath shown. Now to our Arts.—What? do we trembling stand? “'Tis hard to execute an ill Command. “Who Royal Mandates serve yet, must lay by “All Sense of Just and Honest: Modesty “Is an ill Agent for a Prince's Ends. Hip. Kind Nurse, why com'st thou with a Look portends Sadness and Care? I hope no News o'th'King, Queen, or my Brothers, that is bad, you bring. Nur. Remit these Fears: thy Father's Court and State Flourish at present with a Prosp'rous Fate. Would'st thou for happier Fortune be inclin'd; The Care of thee afflicts my aged Mind, Who to thy self art rigorously unkind. Whom Fates have made so, may live wretched; those Who uncompell'd themselves to Ills expose, And their own Tort'rers prove, deserve to lose Those Joys, like Fools, they know not how to use. Thy Years remembring, give thy Mind the rein, And in the solemn Feasts, with sportive vein, Brandish thy Torch: drown all thy Cares in Wine, And, while thou may'st, enjoy this Life of thine, Which quickly flies away. An am'rous Breast, And gentle Venus suit a Young-man best. Cheer up! why ly'st thou all alone a Nights? This Sadness quit, and revel in Delights. Let not thy Youth thus Perish in its Prime; God hath a Duty set for every Time, And does our Life through its Degrees extend, And to our Age proportions a fit End. Mirth is the Ornament of youthful Years, Sad Looks and Gravity become Grey Hairs. Why dost thy pregnant Genius thus restrain? That Corn does yield the Plowman ample Gain, Which in unvexed Furrows freely grows; And 'bove the Wood that Tree extends its Boughs Which no malignant Hand does lop: Wits be “Apt to rise high, cherish'd by Liberty. Thou like a churlish Huntsman lead'st thy Life, Nor, young, wilt know the Pleasures of a Wife. Think'st thou that Nature Men for this did frame, To suffer Hardship, and wild Beasts to tame? Or manage bloody Wars? Ah no: that great And wise Disposer of this All, hath set This Law, that since Fates so rapacious are, We with successive Issue should repair Nature's Decays. Venus this World exclude, (Venus, by whom our human Stock's renew'd) And all the Beauty of this World decay, No Ships will Sails on empty Seas display; Skies will want Birds; Woods will want Game to kill, And nought but Wind will Air's vast Region fill. Alas! how many kinds of Death there be Attending Man! Seas, Sword and Treachery. Say we were subject to no Laws of Fate, Yet of our selves we haste to our Lives Date, To Styx dark shades; should barren Youth then lead A single Life, nor know the Marriage Bed, All that thou seest, in one short Age of Man, Would come to Ruine; follow Nature then, The Guide of Life: thy Time in Towns be spent, And Jovial Society frequent. Hip. No Life so happy, none from Ill so free, So near the elder Times Integrity. As that which, leaving Towns in Fields is led: No avaricious Fury fills his Head, Who lives the harmless Guest of Hills and Wood. No Breath of People, faithless to the Good, Nor rancorous Spleen, nor Favour's fickle Grace, Nor fleeting Riches, nor vain Honour's Chace, Affect his Soul.— He's no Court Vassal: gapes not for a Crown, Nor toils to compass it: fears no man's Frown, Ne'er couzen'd is with flatt'ring Hopes; nor yet By the base Tooth of black-mouth'd Envy bit. Nor of those Ills which reign in Cities knows. Nor conscious fears how the loud Rumour goes. Studies no Lies: nor seeks his House to build Upon a thousand Collumns; or begil'd His carved Roofs: nor sacrificing, drowns In Blood the Altar: nor slays Hecatombs Of Snow-white Oxen with Meal-sprinkled Crowns. But harmless wand'ring in the open Air, The Solitary Country's Sweets dos share. No cunning Subtleties or Craft he knows, But to intrap wild Beasts; and when he grows Weary with Toil, his tired Limbs he laves In cool Ilissus pure refreshing Waves. Now by the Banks of swift Alphæus strays, And the thick Coverts of the Woods surveys. Where Lerna's Streams with chilling Waters pass, Clear and pellucid as transparent Glass. His Seat oft changes: from their warbling Throats The querelous Birds here strain a thousand Notes. Whilst through the Leaves the whisp'ring Zephyre blows, And wags the aged Beaches spreading Boughs. There, by the Current of some silver Spring, Upon a Turf behold him slumbering; Whilst the licentious Stream through new-sprung Flow'rs With pleasing Murmurs its sweet Water pours, Red-sided Apples, falling from the Trees, And Straw-berries, new-gather'd, do appease His Hunger with soon purchas'd Food, who flies Th'abhor'd Excess of Princely Luxuries. In Gold let fearful Tyrants quaff: his Cup's His Hand, whence he with greater Gusto sups Some fresh cool Spring: he sleeps more sound and sure On a hard Bed, than they who do secure Their Thefts in dark Receptacles; afraid, Tho under multiplicious shelter laid. He seeks the Light, and makes the Heav'n and Skies To witness how he lives. Sure on this wise The first Age liv'd, when Gods convers'd with Men. No blind Desire of Gold possess'd them then. Nor did there any Sacred Land-mark bound Unto the People the unmeasur'd Ground. No credulous Ships as yet did plough the Flood, Each knew his own Seas; as yet Cities stood Ungirt with a deep Trench and flanked Line; The Soldier did not yet to Arms incline His fiercer Hands; as yet no bar'd up Ports By the Balista's weighty Shot were Forc'd. Beneath no Lords Commands the Earth did bow, Nor did yoak'd Oxen draw the furrowing Plough. But then the free and self-impregned Field Did Food to the contented People yield: The Woods on them their native Wealth bestow'd, Their Native Houses to dark Caves they ow'd. Rash Anger, and the wicked Love of Gain, Unbounded Lust, and bloody Thirst of Reign, This sacred League first broke: the Strong then o'er The Weak began to prey, Right then was Pow'r. At first the Combat by bare Fists was try'd, Then Stones, and ruder Staves their Arms supply'd. The lighter Cornet was not tipt with Steel; No Sword adorn'd the Thigh; no Head did feel The weight of plumed Casque. Rage first made Arms, And furious Mars invented unknown Harms, And thousand Forms of Death: hence Blood did stain The Face of Earth, and the Seas wat'ry Plain. Then Ills through each House ran without restraint, Nor was there Crime without a Precedent. Brothers by Brothers, Fathers were of Life By Sons depriv'd, the Husband by the Wife; And wicked Mothers their own Children slew. (Not to name Step-Mothers; that cursed Crew, Than Beasts more merciless;) But Woman kind, First mover of all horrid Crimes, inclin'd Mens Thoughts to ill; whose wicked Lusts and Dire Incests have set so many Towns on fire. So many Nations rais'd to Arms, o'erthrown So many Empires; wave all else, alone Ægeus Wife, Medea can declare How great a Curse and Mischief Women are. Nur. Why should the Faults of some on all be prest? Hipp. Out! I abhor the Sex, abjure, detest; Whether by Reason, Nature, Rage inclin'd, I hate 'em all. Floods shall with Flames be joyn'd, And Ships secure in swallowing Quick-Sands ride, Phœbus from Tethys Western Lap be spy'd To take his rise; Wolves to young Kids be kind, Ere Woman Place in my Affections find. Nur. The most perverse have yet been tam'd by Love, Whose Power, from Hearts, all Hatred can remove; The truth of this thy Mothers Kingdoms prove. Those fierce Virago's Venus Yoke sustain, Thou sole-born of thy Mother mak'st this plain. Hipp. My Mothers death does me this help allow, That I can freely hate all Women now. Nur. As the firm Rock does the Waves Charge sustain, And beats th'assailing Surges back again; So he my words repels—But Phædra, see Hurrying with Speed, and wild Impatiencie! What wills she? Whether tends her furious Race? Alas! She's fall'n into a Swoon, her Face Is pale as Death.—Look up! Speak Phædra! See Thy dear Hippolytus embraces thee. Phæ. O who recalls my Sorrows with my Breath! And my fierce Flames renews? How sweetly Death Had took me from my self and them! Yet why Should'st thou the sweeter Joys Life offers, fly? Take courage; freely act thy own Command. Speak boldly. “They who timorously stand “T'intreat, teach to deny. The greatest part Of my Crime's past. Shame comes too late; my Heart By Love nefandous foil'd. Yet, it may be, (If e'er their wished Ends my Wishes see) The name of Marriage may my Shame suppress. “Some Crimes have been made honest by success. On then, begin.—Let me intreat your Ear A while in private; if there be any near, Withdraw— Hipp. The place is free from Ear or Eye. Phæd. My Tongue doth utterance to my Words deny. A great Force strives my bashful Speech t'eject, Which by a greater Force again is checkt. Be witness, O ye Gods! The thing I would— —Is 'gainst my Will. Hipp. What does thy Tongue withold? Phæd. “Small Griefs can speak, the great are stupifi'd. Hipp. Fear not, dear Mother, in my Breast to hide Thy Cares. Phæd. That Name of Mother is too proud A stile, an humbler Title would b'allow'd Our Loves; Or Sister me, or Servant call, But Servant rather: For whose sake I shall Refuse no kind of Service; bid me go, And Ill climb Pindus, crown'd with Ice and Snow; Through Fire I'll pass, or (if thou say't) upon Arm'd Troops, and the drawn Swords of Foes I'll run. To thee, m' intrusted Scepter, I resign, With that, my self; accept of me as thine. It thee becomes to rule, me to obey, Thy Fathers Realms suit not a Womans Sway. Do thou, adorn'd with vigorous Youth, this Land And People govern under thy command; And me, thy Suppliant and thy Servant, take Into thy Bosom; and for Pity's sake, Pity a Widow. Hipp. Heav'ns make the Omen vain! My Father safe will soon return again. Phæd. The King who Hell's tenacious Empire sways, And silent Styx, made no retreating ways To Light again. Think'st thou he'll e'er let scape Him, who intended to his Bed a Rape? Unless his sterner Mind do gentle prove, And pardon his Offence, since caus'd by Love. Hipp. The righteous Gods will his Return befriend. But whilst our Wishes those high Powers suspend, I shall my Brothers with that Love affect, As fits a Brother, and shall thee protect. Think not thy self a Widow; I'll to thee A Husband in my Father's absence be. Phæd. How credulous are Lovers Hopes! O vain Delusive Love! Is this enough, and plain H' hath spoke? I'll try him further yet with Pray'rs. O pity me, and bow thy gentle Ears To my Complaints; fain would I speak, yet loth I am— Hipp. What is thy Grief? Phæd. Such as, in troth, Thou'l't scarce believe, should e'er a Step-Dame vex. Hipp. Thy words are still ambiguous, and perplex. Speak plainer. Phæd. Know then, Loves fierce Flames my Breast Do scorch, and on my inmost Marrow feast; The Flame within my Bowels hid, doth fly Through all my Veins, and every Artery. As when a Fire some House hath seiz'd upon, The nimble Flame from Beam to Beam does run. Hipp. The Love of Theseus these chast Flames does move; Phæd. 'Tis true, my dear Hippolytus, I love Those former Looks of Theseus, that young Face, When first the budding Down his Cheeks did grace. When from the Gnossian Monster's Den, b' a Thred He through the winding Labyrinth was led. How shone he then, his Locks with Ribbands ty'd, Whilst his pure Looks a Scarlet Tincture dy'd. Strong Arms! His Face did like thy Phœbe's shine, Or like my Phœbus looks, or rather thine. Such, such he seem'd then, when he pleas'd the Eye Ev'n of his Foe: So bare his Head on high. Thy Looks are free from all adulterate Grace, Thy very Father's Looks; yet in thy Face Part of thy Mothers Sternness, with a sweet And a becoming Mixture seems to meet. A Scythian Rigour in a Grecian Look. Hadst thou that Voyage with thy Father took, When to the Cretan Monster he was sent, My Sister thee, not him, the Clue had lent. Oh Sister, wheresoe'er in Heav'n you shine, Help me, now plung'd in a Distress like thine! To one House both of us our Ruin owe, Thou to the Father, I the Son. See, low, As to thy Knees, a royal Suppliant bows, And her unblemish'd Fame and Honour vows To thy sole Will: With this resolved Mind, Or of my Grief or Life an end to find. Pity a Lover then. Hipp. Dread Sovereign Of Heav'n-thron'd Deities! Crimes thus profane Dost thou so slowly see; so slowly hear! Sleeps thy just Vengeance? When will thy severe Hand Thunder dart, if now the Heavens be clear? Now let the forced Skies descend, and Clouds The day invellop in dark pitchy Shrouds. Stars retrograde their Course obliquely run! O thou sidereal Head, thou radiant Sun! Seest thou these horrid Crimes of thy bright Race? Fly, fly for shame, and hide in Night thy Face. Why is thy Hand thus idle, O thou Sire Of Gods and Men? Why scapes the World the Fire Of thy three-forked Thunder? At my Head Level; let thy quick Lightning strike me dead. I guilty am, and well deserve, since I This wicked Stepmother did please, to dye. Was I for thy foul Incest worthy thought? Seem'd I alone fit matter to be wrought To thy base Ends? Has my Austerity Merited this? O thou, who dost outvy Thy impious Sex in high Impiety? That dar'st a more abominable Fact, Than did thy Monster-bearing Mother act. Far worse than she that bare thee: She with plain Whoredom alone her Marriage-Bed did stain; Yet was her Crime at last, tho' long conceal'd, By her strange Issues double shape, reveal'd. When the ambiguous Infant did proclaim, With a fierce savage Look, its Mothers shame. The Womb that bare that Monster, brought forth thee. Thrice, oh, thrice happy, who by Treacherie Or Hate, their Lives have lost. Father thy Fate I envy, and deplore my own sad State. A greater Mischief far is mine to me, Than was thy Colchian Stepdame unto thee. Phæd. O now our wretched Houses Fate we find! What we should fly we follow: Of my mind All Rule is lost. Yet thee, through Fire, through Seas, O'er Rocks, through Torrents threatning Deluges, Fearless I'll follow: Wheresoe'er thou go'st, Like to a Frantick, after thee I'll post. Disdainful Youth! See! I again decline My prostrate Limbs, and on my Knees hug thine. Hipp. Take off thy Hands, nor my chast Limbs pollute. How's this? Like a lascivious Prostitute, Into Embraces rushing? Then my Sword Unto her Crime due Punishment afford. See! In the Tresses of the impudent My Hand I've wound; and her Head backward bent. No juster Sacrifice, thou bow-arm'd Maid, Was ever on thy Virgin-Altars laid. Phæd. Now thou art kind; thou grant'st me my Desires, Hippolytus, and cur'st my raging Fires. 'Tis 'bove my Wish that slain by thee I dye Without a Wrong unto my Chastity. Hipp. Hence! Live; lest to thy Pray'rs I seem to yield. This Sword too, by thy lustful Touch defil'd, Quit my chast side. What Tanais, from this Stain, Or what Mœotis, near the Pontic Main, Can wash me clean? Not Neptune with his whole Ocean can ever expiate so foul, So great a Guilt.—O Woods! O Beasts! [Exit. Nur. Her Crime Detected is.—What dull'd my Wits? No Time Is to be lost: Turn back the Crime we must. And charge Hippolytus with horrid Lust. “Mischief with Mischief must be veil'd: We see't, “'Tis safest, Dangers that are fear'd, to meet. We may be Sufferers, not Aggressors thought, Who knows? Since there's no Witness of the Fault. Help! Help Athenians! Servants, help your Queen: Behold Hippolytus (O horrid Sin!) Attemps a Rape upon his Fathers Wife, Threatning to force her Honour or her Life. Now hence he's fled, swift as the Wings of Wind, Yet in his Fear, hath left his Sword behind. Which, as the Witness of his soul intent, We keep; but first, be your Endeavours bent To comfort the sad Queen. Let her torn Hair Hang as it does; into the City bear The Marks of this unparallel'd Offence. Madam, cheer up, recover your lost Sence. Tear not your self; or to be seen distast. “Not Fortune makes us, but the Mind, unchast. CHORUS. Declaring the Flight, and praising the comely Person of Hippolytus. Swift as a raging Storm he flies, Or Hurricano through the Skies. Swifter than Meteors rapid course, Which the impulsive Winds do force, When hurry'd through the airy Main, They glide with a long fiery Train. Let wand'ring Fame those Beauties praise, That were the Grace of elder days. Compar'd with thee, by so much thine Their boasted Beauties would out-shine, By how much greater Light adorns Bright Phœbe, when she joyns her Horns In a full Orb, and with swift Race, Drives through the Skies with blushing Face, When every lesser Star retires Dim'd by the Splendor of her Fires. Such the bright Usher of dark Night Rises from Seas with new-bath'd Light, Hesper; the same, Night chac'd away Lucifer, Herald of the Day. Not Indian Liber still unshorn, Whom Youth unfading does adorn, Who does with Vine-bound Spear enforce His restife Tygers in their Course. Whose Brows with Honrs Majestick crown'd Are with a golden Mitre bound, Can boast his curled Locks more fair Than thy unordered Tresses are. Nor yet let him too much be took With self-conceit of his own Look, Whom Fame says Ariadne's Eyes Before great Bromio's self did prize. Beauty, which few a Good can stile, Thou Gift enjoy'd but a short while, How swiftly dost thou fly away! Not so the Sun's Meridian Ray, Spoils the fresh Meadows of the Green Which the late Spring had cloath'd them in; When Earth beneath the Solstice fries, And the short Night before him flies. Pale Lillies languish, Roses shed Their sweet Leaves, grateful to the Head. So soon that radiant Tincture dies, That does soft Cheeks vermilionize, Rapt in a moment: Every day From Beauty bears some Spoil away. None wise then such a fleeting Toy Will trust; but while they may, enjoy; Time does with silent motion hast, Succeeding Hours are worse than past. Why seek'st thy self in Woods t'obscure? Beauty's in Desarts not more sure. Thee in some shady Covert laid, When Phœbus his mid-Course hath made, Will wanton Naïad's close in Rings, Fair Youths imprisoning in their Springs. Lascivious Wood-Nymphs, Mountain-Fawns, Rude Satyrs that frequent the Lawns, Will subtle Ambushes devise, How they may, sleeping, thee surprize. Should'st thou be by the Night's bright Queen (Younger than the Arcadians) seen, In star-deckt Skies as she does ride, Her Chariot she'd forget to guide. And late she blush'd, tho no dark Cloud Did her bright Looks obscurely shroud. When we imputing her chang'd Light To some Thessalian Charmer's Spight, Did make the hollow Brass resound. But thou, the only Cause wert found, And Charm, that did her stay enforce; For seeing thee she stopt her Course. On thy fair Looks let seldom beat The Winter's Cold or Summer's Heat; Their White the Marble shall outvy, That does in Parian Quarries ly. How lovely shews thy manly Face? How sweet thy Brows majestick Grace? Thy Ivory Neck thou may'st compare With Phœbus, whose loose-flowing Hair Beneath his Shoulders reaches down; Thee thy rough Front, and curled Crown, And shorter Tresses grace; which fly, Whiskt by the Wind disorderly. Thou may'st with warlike Deities For Strength contend; and gain the Prize. Thy Arms, like Hercules; thy Breast Ample as Mars his broad-spread Chest. When mounted on some bounding Steed, Castor for Horsemanship exceed Thou do'st; and canst, with nimble Hand His Spartan Cyllarus command. Unto thy Fingers fit thy Dart, And throw with all thy Strength and Art, Cretans, whose Skill we so commend, Shall not their Arrows further send. Or would'st thou, Parthian like, let fly Thy winged Shafts into the Sky; None shall return again unsped, But in warm Entrails hide its Head, And from the Clouds (thy Art to crown) Its fleeting Mark, trasfix'd bring down. Beauty in Men (Time's Annals see) 'Scapes rarely with Impunity, May thine yet meet no Powers severe, But safe as deform'd Age appear. What is't that Women when they are Incenst with Fury will not dare? The guiltless Youth must now be made Guilty of Rape: And to perswade That horrid Fact, with Tresses rent, And Head despoil'd of Ornament, Mad Phædra runs, and weeps, and cries, And all that Womans Wit can, tries To make her Mischief take.—But see! Who's this that bears such Majesty In lofty Looks, and struts it thus? How like to young Hippolytus! Were not his Looks so wan, or Hair All foul'd, did not so rudely stare. Sure, if I not mistaken be, 'Tis Theseus new return'd; 'tis he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. Scene I. Enter THESEUS return'd from Hell. THESEUS. From Bounds of endless Night, and that vast Deep, In whose dark Horrours Souls imprison'd keep, At length w' are fled.—My Eyes the Light scarce brook, Four times the Eleusinian Plowman's Hook The Bounties of Triptolemus hath cut. As oft in equal Scales hath Libra put The Day and Night, since I my doubtful Breath, Drew 'twixt the sad Extreams of Life and Death. Yet in that Death-like state some Life remain'd, My Sence in my Afflictions still retain'd; These Ills their End from great Alcides found; Who, when from Hell he dragg'd th'infernal Hound, Me from my Adamantine Chains set free, And brought along once more his Light to see. My Limbs not now their former Strength retain, My Legs beneath me tremble: O what Pain Was it from the Abyss of Hell to climb. To this Ætherial World, and at one time Retreat from Death, and with unequal Pace The mighty Strides of Hercules to trace! What sadder Cries are these that strike mine Ears? Declare some one; what mean these Plaints, these Tears And mixed Lamentations in our Ports? Well t'an infernal Guest this Mansion sorts. Enter NURSE, in haste.

Open the Palace Doors there, oh My Dear! is this the Welcome thou do'st show? Thus thy long-lookt-for Spouse do'st entertain. Throw by that Sword; restore to me again My frighted Senses, and the Cause relate Would force thee thus by Death t'anticipate. Phæd. By thy imperial Sceptre, by the Grace And springing Glory of thy hopeful Race, By thy return, and my determin'd Death, Permit me to resign my hated Breath. Thes. What Cause constrains thee to't? Phæd. Should I disclose The Cause of Death, I should Death's Comfort lose. Thes. None but my self shall hear it; dost thou doubt To trust it to thy Husband's Ear? Speak out; Close in my faithful Breast thy Words shall sleep. Phæd. “If Silence you'd expect, first, Silence keep. Thes. I'll take from thee Death's Opportunity. Phæd. None can, from one that is resolv'd to dy. Thes. The Crime, whose Expiation Death must prove, Declare. Phæd. 'Tis 'cause I live. Thes. Do these Tears move No whit thy harder Heart? Phæd. “She happy dies “Whose Death is waited on by weeping Eyes. Thes. She still persists in silence: yet what she Denies to utter, from her Nurse shall be By Whips, and clogging Chains enforc'd; in Bands Of Iron quickly bind her guilty Hands, And on her Back redoubled Stripes impose, 'Till she this Secret of her Mind disclose. Phæd. Hold! I'll confess't my self. Thes. Why turn'st aside Thy sadder Looks? And with thy Veil do'st hide Thy Tear-dew'd Cheeks? Phæd. Be Witness, O thou, Sire, Of Heaven-thron'd Gods, and thou, whose radiant Fire Ætherial Light begets: On whose bright Ray Depends the Lustre of our House and Day. By no Temptations could we be inclin'd, Nor could or Threats, or Steel inforce my Mind, Although my Body suffer'd Violence: Whose Shame's Pollution now my Blood shall cleanse. Thes. What Villain was't durst thus our Honour wrong? Phæd. One whom you least imagin should. Thes. I long To hear him nam'd. Phæd. This Sword will tell, which by Thy brutish Ravisher (with the loud Cry Of People that came passing to our aid, Frighted) was left, as hence his Flight he made. Thes. What see I, Wretch! what Prodigy behold! The Royal Ivory markt with Studs of Gold, Grace of th'Actæan Name; but of his Guilt, The cursed Evidence, shines in the Hilt. Where is the Villain fled? Thæd. These Servants here Beheld him swiftly flying, wing'd with Fear. Thes. O sacred Piety? O Jove! Who bears The Rule, and guid'st the Motions of the Sphears. And thou, who hold'st in Seas the second Reign, Whence springs the Taint of this accursed Strain? Seems he in Greece? Or near the Desart Head Of Taurus? Or the Banks of Phasis bred! “A vicious Kind to its first Rise turns back, “And base Blood shews of its foul Spring the Track. Those fierce Viragoes Venus chaster ties, And the strict Laws of Wedlock do despise. Their Virgin Shames exposing to the rude Embraces of a lustful Multitude. O the curst Fate of such a vicious Race! Whose Manners better by no change of Place. Even Beasts incestuous Coiture disclaim, The Laws of Kind preserv'd by inbred Shame. Where's that feign'd manly Look that seem'd t'affect The Antient Garb and Manners? Grave Aspect? “Deceitful Life! Who thy hid Sense can find? “That mask'st with a fair Face, a deform'd Mind. “The impudent Shames modest Blushes wears, “The Ruffian Meekness; Irreligion bears “The shew of Piety; and Truth, Deceit “Seems to affect; Hardship th'Effeminate Didst thou reserve thy self for me, thou rude, And undefil'd Inhabitant o'th' Wood? And seem'd it fit thy Manhood to begin, By wronging of my Bed? By such a Sin? Now, now, I gladly thank the Heavenly Powers, Antiope fell by this Hand of ours. That while for Stygian Deeps we were design'd, We thy own Mother left thee not behind. Go where thou wilt, to unknown Nations fly, Get thee to Lands the most remote, that ly From all the World divided by huge Seas; Though thou descend to the Antipodes, Or climb (to find thee out some obscure Hole To hide thee in) above the high-rais'd Pole. And see Snows, Storms, and the fierce Northern Wind. Beneath thee bluster; Vengeance yet shall find Thee out; through all thy lurking Holes I'll trace Thee Fugitive, to the most distant place Where yet no wandring Foot e'er found Access. Although immur'd within some Rocks Recess; Dark and abstruse; I'll search and find thee there, No place shall hinder my Pursuit: And where Arms cannot reach thee, Curses shall. Do'st know From whence we came?—Dread Neptune did bestow This Boon on us, that we Three Pray'rs should make, To which he'd sign; and by th'adjur'd Lake Of Styx, confirm'd his Vow. O now make good This thy sad Gift, thou Ruler of the Flood! No longer let Hippolytus the Light Of Day behold; but to the Shades of Night, Curst by his Father, in Youth's Prime descend. To me this execrable Aid extend! Had we not been by weighty Ills opprest, We never had enforc'd this last Request. When in Tartarian Deeps by Dis inchain'd, This Vow we spar'd, from this last Wish abstain'd. Kind Father, now thy promis'd Boon fulfil. Why tarry'st thou? Why are the Seas yet still? Let Cloud-compelling Winds blow Night on Day, And take the sight of Heav'n and Stars away. Unsluce the Main, and let the watery Flood Rise high, and swell; big with a monstrous Brood. [Exit. CHORUS. Great Parent of the Deities, Nature! And thou who rul'st the Skies! By whom the Star-imbellish'd Heaven Is with a rapid Motion driven; Who guid'st the Planets, and the Poles On nimble-turning Hinges rowls. So great a Care why do'st thou prove T'inform those restless Spheres above! That now the hoary Frost bereaves The Woods and Forests of their Leaves. Now Shade to every Shrub returns; Now fiery Leo Ceres burns; Now milder Autumn does asswage The Rigour of his scorching Rage. And yet great Monarch of this World (By whom the just-pois'd Orbs are hurl'd Round 'bout their Centres) seem alone Of Mortals so neglectful grown, As if by thee no Thought were had, To help the Good or plague the Bad! “Chance without Order does command “Th'Affairs of Men; and with blind Hand “Her ill-plac'd Bounties does dispence, “Whilst Lust triumphs o'er Innocence. “Fraud does in Courts of Princes reign, “And 'tis the Peoples giddy vain “With Power base Abjects to invest, “And whom they honour, soon detest. “Sad Virtue reaps an unjust Meed, “And Chastity's opprest with Need. “Whilst viciously potent grown, “Th'Adulterer does climb a Throne. Vain Modesty! Deceitful Grace! But stay; what News with nimble pace, Is this the hasty Nuncius bears? His sad Cheeks stain'd with falling Tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IV. Scene I. Enter NUNCIUS and THESEUS. NUNCIUS. O the hard Fortune of a servile state! Forc'd to be Nuncius of so sad a Fate. Thes. Fear not the worst of Crosses to disclose, I have a Breast not un-inur'd to Woes. Nunc. Voice to so great a Grief my Tongue denies. Thes. On our crush'd State what heavier Burthen lies? Nunc. Hippolytus, ah me! Is dead—dead— Thes. He Long since hath been as a Son dead to me. Now, as a Ravisher, at length he's dead. But say the manner how. Nunc. As hence he fled With nimble steps, his harness'd Steeds he fits Unto his Chariot, rein'd with curbing Bits. When muttering much unto himself, the Land That bred him cursing; oft with heav'd up Hand, He cries, O Father! Then with Whip constrains His Horses speed, and slacks their checking Reins. When strait, the Sea, like a huge Mountain swelling, Rose to the Stars, no breath of Wind compelling. No Storm in any part of Heav'n was heard, The Waters, with a self-rais'd Tempest stir'd. Not so Sicilias storm-vex'd Ocean raves, Nor work the Seas with such high-going Waves At Corus Blasts, when Rocks their Fury dread, And their white Spry strikes Leucad's misty Head. The Sea a watry Pelion now appears, Big with a Monster, which to shoar she bears. Nor to wreck Ships is this wild Tempest meant, The Land it threatens: Billows thither bent Roll swiftly: Nor know we with what strange Birth They labour; or what Miracle the Earth Would shew the Stars. The toiled Waves appear, Prest with a Burthen which they groan to bear. That seems some Island from the troubled Seas, Rais'd to augment the numerous Cyclades. In Waves the Epidaurian Fane lies drown'd, The Rocks, by Scyron's Villanies, renown'd, And Isthmos, which two Seas imbrace; whilst we This with Amazement view, behold the Sea Begins with horrid Bellowings to resound, Which the remugient Rocks do eccho round. A big-swol'n Head, froath'd with a briny Spry, Vomits the Sea's salt Charge alternately. As some huge Whorlpool rowl'd through Deeps about; From whistling Trunk the gulped Stream does spout. And now the Waters, breaking with a Roar, Discharge the dreadful Monster on the Shore. Our Fears exceeding: the Waves rushing on, Threat to the Land an Inundation, Following their monstrous Birth: We shook for fear. Thes. Say yet what shape did this strange Monster bear? Like to a Bull he seem'd above the Breast, Advancing his green Front and curled Crest, With bristled Ears, and party-colour'd Horn, Such as the Ruler of the Herd adorn; Or those that live in Seas; who from his dire Throat vomits Flames, as his Eyes sparkle Fire. His Neck, distinguished with azure Spots, Swelling with brawny Rolls, and fleshy Knots. His wide-stretch'd Nostrils snort; green Moss his Brest, And, Dulaps like, a Pectoral invest. His Sides with red distain'd: and where they end, The rest does in a monstrous Fish descend, Big as a mighty Whale, which in the Main Swallows down Ships, and casts them up again. The Land shook; Cattel, at the Noise afeard, Ran 'bout the Fields; the Shepherd left his Herd. Wild Beasts forsook their Coverts; Fear possest With chilling Cold each Hunter's bloodless Brest. Hippolytus undaunted yet remains, Curbing his Horses in with hard-born Reins; And to their Fears exciting Words applies. A way through broken Rocks to Argos lies A long the Shore. The Monster here makes halt, Whets his keen Rage, and arms for the Assault. When after a short Prelude with his Ire, Finding his chafed Courage to aspire; The Ground scarce touching, forth he swiftly flies, And fronts the trembling Steeds with glaring Eyes. Whom the brave Youth thus charges, undismaid, With thundring Voice, and Looks that Wrath display'd. Vain Fears my manly Mind can ne'er surprize, To foyl Bulls, was my Fathers Exercise. With that the frighted Horses hurry on The whirling Chariot, and distracted run, Where e'er their Fear their wilder Fury drives: Quitting the Road, they climb the rocky Clives. But, as a Pilot, lest rough Seas o'erwhelm His Bark, with all his strength belays the Helm, And breaks with Art the swelling Waves; so here, In rugged ways does he his Chariot steer. Now holds his Horses in, now as they skip, And fling about, corrects them with his Whip. His Foe pursues him still with equal pace, Now siding him, now charging Face to Face; Provoking Fear on every Hand: And now Further he could not go; for with fierce Brow Confronting him, the Sea-born Monster stands. His frighted Horses breaking all Commands, Plunge to get loose; and rearing bolt upright, Throw to the ground their Master, who (sad Sight!) Falling, lies fetter'd in th'intangling Reins, Which bind him faster still the more he strains. His Steeds perceiv'd the sad Disaster strait, And with the Chariot (wanting now its Weight, And wonted Driver) where Fear spurs them, run. So the illustrious Chariot of the Sun. (Missing its proper Guide) disdaining Day Should know the Rule of an usurped Sway, Threw from the Skies the erring Charioteer. His Blood the Fields distains; rough Briars tear His Hair away; dasht 'gainst the Rock, his Head Rebounds; with many Wounds disfigured. The hurry'd Wheels his dying Members rake, At length his trailed Corps on a burnt Stake Caught by the Groin, stuck fast; the Chariot found A stop a while; its Lord transfix'd: the Wound The Horses checkt: at length, at once, Delay And their poor Lord, straining, they tear away. His half-dead Flesh the thorny Brambles scratch, And every Shrub some piece of him does catch. His mournful Servants running every way About the Fields, about the Thickets stray, And follow where they see their Master trail'd With a long bloody Track the Earth ingrail'd. His tyr'd Hounds howling, trace his Limbs; nor yet With all their Search could his sad Mates complete His mangled Corps. Meets Beauty with such Grace? He who but lately held the Second Place With thee in Empire, thy Crown's Heir design'd, Who, like the Stars, in glorious Lustre shin'd, With recollected Limbs, defac'd and torn, Now piece-meal to his Funeral-Fire is born. Thes. How strongly powerful Nature dost thou bind The Hearts of Parents! How by thee inclin'd, Though 'gainst our Wills! For him, whose guilty Head I lately doom'd to Death; I grieve now dead. Nunc. “For what he wish'd done, none grieves honestly. Thes. “It is the height of Infelicity, “When ev'n our Wishes prove our Curses. Nunc. But Why griev'st thou for him, if thou lov'st him not? Thes. Not that I've lost him grieve I, but that I The Cause should be, he such a Death should dye. CHORUS. What turns th'Affairs of Mortals Wheel About! Small things do hardly feel The Rage of Fortune; what is low, Heavens high Hand strikes with a slight Blow. Sweet Peace in obscure Mansions keeps, A Cottage yields untroubled Sleeps. When Turrets that to Clouds aspire, Feel the rough Tempests storming Ire. Moist Vallies dread not Thunders Stroke, When Caucasus high Crown is broke With Heaven's Artillery; great Hights Jove in a jealous Anger smites. No Storms Plebeian Roofs do rock, Courts only feel the Thunders Shock. Fortune, with doubtful Wings, still flies, And Faith with all Men falsifies. He who lare fled the Shades of Night, And now enjoys the Day's clear Light, Wails his return; finds his own Court Worse Hell than his sad Stygian Port. Great Goddess of th'Athenian State! That Theseus with unwonted Fate Reviews the Heav'ns (the Stygian shore Declin'd) thou ow'st no Soul the more To thy rapacious Unkle; he His Number still complete does see. What mournful Voice invades my Ear? What means mad Phædra with a drawn Sword here?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. Scene I. THESEUS, PHÆDRA, CHORUS, and Servants. THESEUS. What Fury to thy grief-pierc'd Soul adds Stings? Why this drawn Sword? Whence is't this Passion springs? What mean these Outcries? And these Tears you shed Over the hated Reliques of the dead? Phæd. Me, me, thou King of Waves, invade 'gainst me Send forth the horrid Monsters of the Sea. Whatever Thetis in her inmost Deeps, Or in its utmost Waves the Ocean keeps. Unlucky Theseus! Thou, who to thy own, Still fatally revert'st! Father and Son, By thy return, both suffering; born to prove Thy House's Ruine! In thy Hates or Love Unto thy Wives equally hurtful; thus Do I behold thee, dear Hippolytus! And did I make thee such? These Limbs of thine What Scinis or Procrustes did disjoyn? Or hath the Cretan Bull (that makes the round Of the Dædalian Labyrinth resound With horrid Bellowings) mangled thus, and torn Thy tender Body with his goring Horn? Ah me! Where is thy Beauty fled? the Light Of thy fair Eyes, my Stars! Set in dark Night? And art thou dead? Yet let thy Soul a while Here hover, and my last Words hear: Nought vile Will we now speak: This Hand, and 'tis but right, Shall with due Punishment thy Wrongs requite. And this revenging Steel strike through my Brest, And me, at once, of Life and Crime devest. Then through Tartarean Lakes, dark Styx, and through The flaming Phlegeton we'll thee pursue. —But first thy Ghost appease we; thus I spread My Hairs on thee, thus tear them from my Head. It was not lawful that we Souls should joyn, But sure we may joyn Fates: Thus I'll be thine. If then thou'rt chast, unto thy Husband dye, If not, unto thy Love.—Shall ever I Guiltless and innocent again be led To Theseus impiously defiled Bed? O Death, of my unhappy Love the sure Redress, and my Shame's expiating Cure! To thee I fly; receive me in thy wide- Stretch'd Arms, and in thy peaceful Bosom hide. Hear you, Athenians! And thou, Theseus, hear! Worse Father far than I a Stepmother. Whate'er I told you were abhorred Lies, Which from despis'd Affection did arise. And poor Hippolytus is innocent Of all those Crimes my Malice did invent. To charge him with, and punish'd wrongfully. Receive this Truth due to thy Chastity, And see my bared Breast ready to take The just-deserved Steel; whose Blood shall make Atonement for thy Death.—Now learn by us What thou shouldst do for thy lost Son,—dye thus. [Falls upon the Sword. Thes. Thou pale Avernus! You Tenarian Caves! And thou, dark Lethe! from whose grateful Waves, The wretched Souls drink sweet Oblivion: And ye dull Lakes, that with dead Currents run. In Plagues eternal plunge this impious Head. Now rise, thou Monster, from thy wavy Bed, With all those numerous Fries, that Proteus keeps In lowest Seas; into your gulphy Deeps Hurry a Wretch that boasts a Crime so dire, And thou too easily assenting Sire To my rash Vows: Hear! I an Act have done, That merits more than Death, murther'd my Son. Whilst I with Vengence a feign'd Crime pursue, I wickedly am fall'n into a true. Seas, Hell, and Heaven alike our Mischiefs share; What rests? Notorious to Three Realms we are. For this returned we? Scap'd we from Hell free, That we on Earth might double Slaughters see? That Widower, and childless, both, I might At once my Wife's and my Son's Funerals light. O great Alcides! T'whom the Benefit Of this sad Light we owe, to Disremit Thy Gift again.—But on our impious Head In vain do we invoke the Death we fled. Thou bloody Murderer! That could'st devise So many strange unheard of Cruelties. Now on thy self just Vengeance irrogate. May'st thou by Pines forc'd down; by Strength and Weight Upward recoyling, torn asunder be, Or cast from Scyron's Cliffs into the Sea. More horrid Torments yet, where Phlegeton With streams of Fire surrounds the damn'd, are known, And we have seen: Those Plagues, that place full well To us belong: Make room ye Ghosts of Hell. On me the weighty Stone impose; and ease The wearied Hands of old Æolides. Let cousening Streams my thirsty Lips deceive, Now let the greedy Vulture Titius leave, And on my growing Liver ever feast! Rest, dear Perithous his Parent, rest; Unto thy torturing Wheel let me be bound, And with perpetual motion hurried round: Cleave Earth! And swallow me, thou dark Abyss Of Night! This way to Hell more fitting is For Theseus. Son! I follow thee. Nor fear Thou King of Souls! Not as a Ravisher Do I now come, but as thy peaceful Guest, In thy eternal Mansions still to rest. Receive me then!—But 'lass! These Pray'rs of mine Are fruitless; nor relentless Gods incline; Were it some Mischief we implor'd, our Pray'r How soon would they then grant, how quickly hear! Chor. Time for thy Tears, enough rests: Theseus! now Unto thy Son his Funeral Rites allow; And decently his Limbs disjoyn'd and torn, Quickly compose! Thes. O give me leave to mourn! Hither the sad Remainders of his dear Lov'd Body bring; here lay 'em, lay 'em here. Is this Hippolytus?—My own dire Act I now acknowledg; detestable Fact! I murther'd thee, Hippolytus! 'twas I, And lest my Guilt should want a double Dy; Or I an Accessory to my Sin, Unto my Aid I call'd my Father in. Now see for what thou didst his Help engage! O what a Cross is Orbity to Age Broken with Sorrows! In thy Arms imbrace His mangled Limbs, and groveling on thy Face, A miserable Wretch, what yet does rest Of thy Sons Limbs now cherish in thy Brest. His torn and scatter'd Members recompose, And every Limb in its due place dispose. Here, as I take it, this stout Arm should stand; Here, that so well could guide the Reins, this Hand; This sure a Part of his Left Side appears: How much of him yet's wanting to our Tears! Hold, trembling Hands, till this sad Work be done; And stay my parched Cheeks these Tears that run From my swoln Eyes, whilst I recount my slain Son's Limbs, and piece his Body up again. Here's a torn shapeless Lump: What Part of thee It is, I know not, but some Part 't must be; Here lay't, in this void place; there let it lie, And that, though not its own, since void, supply. Is this that bright sydereal Face of thine, That could thy Enemy to Love incline? And is thy Beauty come to this? Dire Fate! More cruel Love! But far more cruel Hate! Thus at thy Father's Wish return'st thou, Son! Of my great Parent, loe! The last kind Boon Afforded me! That with repeated Cries I thus should pay thee piece-meal Obsequies. But now commit these Reliques to the Fire. Set open wide our Palace by so dire A Slaughter stain'd; and let sad Athens round With Plaints of mournful Citizens resound. You, whilst these here search for his Limbs that are Yet unretriev'd; the Funeral Pile prepare. For her, the Grave afford her Bones a Bed. But lye Earth heavy on her impious Head. FINIS.</field>
