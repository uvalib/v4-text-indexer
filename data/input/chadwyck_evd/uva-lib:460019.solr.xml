      <field name="fulltext">JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN. A SACRED DRAMA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To His GRACE the DUKE of MONTAGUE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. Jacob had Twelve Children, whereof Joseph and Benjamin were the two youngest, and were born to him of Rachel. The superior Affection which Jacob shewed towards Joseph, and the Account which the latter gave his Brethren of some of his Dreams denoting his own future Grandeur and their Subjection to him, raised their Jealousy and Hatred against him. Hereupon they take an Opportunity, when they were one Day in the Field together, to throw him first into a Pit, and afterwards to draw him out again, and sell him to a Company of mercantile Ishmaelites who were going down to Egypt, persuading their Father Jacob, by the Stratagem of dipping a Coat which they had strip'd him of, in Blood, that he was devoured by a wild Beast. The Ishmaelites being arrived with Joseph in Egypt, sold him to Potiphar, a principal Officer in Pharaoh's Court, with whom he lived in high Favour a considerable time, 'till at length, upon the false Accusation of Potiphar's Wife, he was disgraced and cast into Prison. During his Confinement, the chief Butler, and chief Baker of Pharaoh's Court, were thrown into the same Place by the King's Order, both of whom having a Dream in the same Night, receiv'd an Interpretation of them from Joseph, which proved true, the chief Baker being within three Days hanged on a Tree, and the chief Butler restored to his Employment as was foretold; but being taken into Favour again thought no more of his Interpreter, as he had promised to do. Here then our Drama finds Joseph, two Years after this Incident had happened. At this Time Pharaoh himself having had two Dreams in the same Night, the First, of Seven fat Kine coming out of the River, which were devoured by Seven other lean Kine which came up after them; and the Second, of Seven full Ears of Corn devoured by Seven thin ones, the Wisemen of Egypt could not interpret them. The chief Butler calling Joseph to Remembrance upon this Occasion, spoke of him to the King, who immediately order'd that he should be brought before him; of whom having received a satisfactory Explication of his Dreams, as they were both of the same Purport, and pointed out Seven Years of Plenty, and Seven of Famine to succeed them, Pharaoh appointed him Ruler over the Land of Egypt, to lay up in the Years of Plenty a Store for a Supply in those of Dearth; at the same time giving him to Wife Asenath the Daughter of Potiphera, High-Priest of On, by whom, during the Years of Plenty, he had two Sons. The Famine having at length spread itself into all Countries, Jacob hearing there was Corn in Egypt, sent his ten elder Sons thither to purchase some, keeping Benjamin the youngest with him for fear some Accident should befal him. Joseph immediately knew his Brethren, and seeing them at his Feet, he remembred his former Dreams, but did not make himself known to them, speaking roughly, treating them as Spies, and ordering them to return and bring down their younger Brother whom they spoke of, as a Proof of their Veracity. Having detained one of them in Prison, by way of a Hostage, he commanded his Officers privately, to restore every one of the others his Money into his Sack, and to send them away with their Corn, for the Land of Canaan. Having, after a long time, prevailed on Jacob to let Benjamin go with them, they returned to Egypt and presented him before Joseph, who tenderly embraced him, and was so sensibly affected by the Interview, that, not being able to refrain from Tears, he was obliged to leave the Room. After this he made a grand Entertainment for them, giving at the same time a secret Order to his Officers to put his Silver Cup into Benjamin's Sack. They had no sooner left the Town the next Morning but they were sent after, brought before Joseph again, and charged with stealing this Cup, when, their Sacks being examined, and the Cup found in that belonging to Benjamin, he was doom'd to continue a Slave to Joseph. The rest of the Brethren refusing to return to their Father without Benjamin with them, and one of them passionately requesting to become a Bondman in his stead, Joseph could refrain no longer, but with Tears gushing from his Eyes, discovered himself to them. This News coming soon to Pharaoh, he order'd Joseph to send immediately, and bring down his Father and whole Family into Egypt, appointing one of the most fruitful Parts of the Country for their Habitation.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">PART I. SCENE I. SCENE, a PRISON. Joseph reclining in a melancholy Posture. AIR. Be firm, my Soul, nor faint beneath Affliction's galling Chains; When crown'd with conscious Virtue's wreath, The shackled Captive reigns. [Starting up. Recitative accompany'd. Jos. But wherefore thus? Whence Heav'n these bitter Bonds? Are these the just Rewards of stubborn Virtue? Is this contagious Cell the due Abode Of too much Innocence?âDown, down, proud Heart, Nor blindly question the Behest of Heaven! These Chastisements are justâfor some wise End Are all the partial Ills allotted Man. AIR repeated. Be firm, my Soul, nor faint beneath Affliction's galling Chains; When crown'd with conscious Virtue's Wreath, The shackled Captive reigns. SCENE II. To Joseph, Phanor. Phan. Joseph, thy Fame has reach'd great Pharaoh's Ear; Who late in Dreams perturb'd, and taught by me The wond'rous Power of thy experienc'd Art, Demands thy instant Presence to unfold Their mystick Purport. Jos. Blest Vicissitude! Jehovah, whom I serve, bears witness to me; And from the Horrors of the Pit, once more, Will deign Deliverance to his Servant's Soul. AIR. Come, divine Inspirer, come, Make my humble Breast thy Home, Draw the Curtain from mine Eye, And present place Futurity. Thus, whilst I o'er Pharaoh's Dream, Bright Interpretation beam, Pharaoh's Self shall Temples raise, And Egypt Incense to thy Praise. [Da Capo. Phan. Pardon that I so long forgot thee, Joseph; My Heart upbraids me with Ingratitude. Jos. Pardon thyselfâIngratitude's a Vice That bears its Scorpions with itâThe dire Mildew Which makes a Desert of the human Mind, And merits more of Pity than Resentmentâ But instant I'll with duteous Step attend My Lord the King, and bow myself before him. [Exit Jos. SCENE III. Phanor. Fell Monster! base Ingratitude! avaunt; No longer in this Breast I'll give thee Harbour. AIR. Ingratitude's the Queen of Crimes, For all the rest are of her Train, Her sure Attendants at all Times, The great Supporters of her Reign: If One you then ungrateful call, You crown him Monarch of them all. SCENE IV. A Room of State in Pharaoh's Palace. Pharaoh, High-Priest of On; Asenath, Chorus of Egyptians, &amp;c. Phar. Thus, Stranger! I have laid my troubled Thoughts, The midnight Visions of my Bed before thee, Which all the Skill of Egypt can't unfoldâ Come then, interpret to the King his Dreams. Jos. O mighty Pharaoh, it is not in me; Interpretation does belong to Heav'n; And may the Lord Jehovah give the King A gracious Answer! [Invocation.] âBy that O'erflowing of the Nile, âWhich makes the careful Tiller smile; âBy those glad Rays that swell the Grain, âAnd pay with Sheaves the Reaper's Pain; âBy all the Blessings ev'ry Day, âWhich Egypt tastes from Pharaoh's Sway, âThy dark Resolves, kind Heav'n! display. Chorus of Egyptians. O God of Joseph, gracious, shed Thy spirit on thy Servant's Head; That to the King he may reveal The Truths his Mystick Dreams conceal. Recitative accompany'd. Jos. Pharaoh, thy Dreams are oneâthe Lord Jehovah In Vision shews what he's about to do. The Seven fat Cattle, and full Ears of Corn, Denote Seven Years of PlentyâThe like Seven Of meagre Kine, and unreplenish'd Grain, Mark the same Years of Famine to succeed. Embrace this Warning, and with studious Search Look out a Man of Providence and Wisdom, To garner up in the redundant Years, A Store for Comfort in the Days of Dearth. Phar. Divine Interpreter! What Oracle Could thus have solv'd my Doubts?âWhere can we find A Man like thee, in whom God's Spirit dwells? Be this Day Ruler o'er my House and People, And by thy Word let all the Land be govern'd; But only in the Throne will I be greater. Jos. These are thy Workings, Infinite Jehovah! AIR. Asen. [Aside.] O lovely Youth, with Wisdom crown'd, Where ev'ry Charm has Place! What Breast so firm was ever found, As could resist such Grace? If thou hast stoln my Virgin Heart, To me in change thy own impart. [Pharaoh putting his Ring on Joseph's Finger.] Phar. Wear, worthy Man! this Royal Signet wear, Pledge of thy boundless Dignity and Power; Whilst in our Second Chariot thou shalt ride, And Heralds cry before thee, Bow the Knee: Then henceforth, as the Saviour of the World, Let Zaphnath-Paaneah signifies Saviour of the World. Zaphnath-Paaneah be thy Name. CHORUS. Joyful sounds! melodious Strains! Health to Egypt is the Theme! Zaphnath rules, and Pharaoh reignsâ Happy Nation! Bliss supreme! [Exunt. SCENE V. Asenath alone. Whence this unwonted Ardour in my Breast? These new-born Sighsâ'Tis true that he is Wiseâ MajestickâgracefulâAh! I fear this Stranger Has trespass'd on my unsuspecting Bosom. AIR. I feel a spreading Flame within my Veins, Which all my Arts will not avail to quench; With fruitless Toil from Place to Place I range, No Toil, no Place gives Respite to my Pains. SCENE VI. To Asenath, Joseph. Jos. Struck, beauteous Damsel, with thy modest Charms, I've ask'd thee of thy Father and the King, To help allay the anxious Toils of Grandeur, And smooth the rugged Brow of Publick Care. Yet, authoris'd by both, I dread my Fate, 'Till thy own Voice has fix'd my Destiny. SCENE VII. To them Pharaoh and Potiphera. Phar. Zaphnath, I grant thy SuitâBehold thy Bride! Potiph. Approach, my AsenathâBehold thy Husband! DUET. Jos. O! canst thou, Fair Perfection! say? O! canst thou bless me with thy Love? Asen. My Father's Will I must obey; My Monarch's Pleasure must approve. Jos. Celestial Virgin! Asen. âGodlike Youth! Both. Renown'd for Innocence and Truth; Propitious Heav'n has thus in Thee Compleated my Felicity. Jos. âO Pharaoh! all the Dignity and Splendor, âWhich thou hast deign'd to robe thy Servant in, âAre nothing to the Gift of this fair Jewel. Phar. âLong mayst thou live to wear her at thy Heart. Now, Potiphera, instant to the Temple In joyous Pomp, and whilst the Rite's perform'd, Let our loud Clarions tell it to the Skies. [Exeunt. A Grand March during the Procession. SCENE VIII. A TEMPLE. The High-Priest joining the Hands of Joseph and Asenath at the Altar, Pharaoh, Attendants, and Chorus of Egyptians. High-Priest. 'Tis doneâthe sacred Knot is ty'd, Which Death alone can e'er divide. CHORUS. Immortal Pleasures crown the Pair, Who thus by Heav'n high-favour'd are, Joys ever round them wait; May these below, like those above, Contend who most and longest love, And be as Blest, as Great. Phar. Glorious and happy is thy Lot, O Zaphnath, Join'd to such Sweetness, Dignity, and Virtue. AIR. Since the Race of Time begun, Since the Birth-Day of the Sun, Ne'er was so much Wisdom found, With such matchless Wisdom crown'd. CHORUS. Swift our Numbers, swiftly roll, Waft the News from Pole to Pole; Asenath with Zaphnath's join'd, Joy and Peace to all Mankind!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. SCENE I. Asenath, Phanor, and Chorus of Egyptians. CHORUS. Hail, thou Youth by Heav'n belov'd! Now thy wond'rous Wisdom's prov'd! Zaphnath Egypt's Fate foresaw, And snatch'd her from the Famine's Jaw. Pha. How vast a Theme has Egypt for Applause! O Asenath, behold thy mighty Lord! High on his gilded Car triumphant ride, Whilst prostrate Multitudes that do him Honours, Obstruct his Passage through the Streets of Memphis. The raptur'd Virgins hail him in their Lays, And gazing Matrons lift their grateful Hands, Whilst hoary Sages rise, and bow the Head, And Infants half articulate his Name. Asen. These Honours flow not from the Flatterers Lips, Like those that lavish Stream in Fortune's Lap; But from Sincere Benevolence, and Love, And Bosoms glowing with a grateful Transport. AIR. Phan. Our Fruits, whilst yet in Blossom, die, Our Harvest's in the new-sown Seed; Barren the mournful Ridges lie, Undeck'd the once enamell'd Mead. But Zaphnath's Providential Care Retaliates for the niggard Soil; Through him in Dearth we Plenty share, Nor heed th'inexorable Nile. [Phan.] He's Egypt's common Parent, gives her Bread; He's Egypt's only Safety, only Hope; Whilst Egypt's Welfare is his only Care. CHORUS. Blest be the Man by Pow'r unstain'd, Virtue there itself rewarding! Blest be the Man to Wealth unchain'd, Treasure for the Publick hoarding! Asen. Phanor, we mention not his highest Glory, Mark midst his Grandeur what Humility, The Gift of that great God whom he adores. Yet something seems of late to bear upon him, And cloud his wonted Smile; not all his Splendor, Th'Applause of Millions, or my studious Love, Can yield him Comfort, or asswage his Grief. Phan. Perchance he wants to view his native Land, Whose God and Laws are the Reverse of Egypt's. Asen. Phanor, 'tis true, he calls it oft' to mind, And oft' in Silence sighs, and mourns his Absence; Nor finds he Peace, save when his smiling Infants, The Pledges of our Love, are in his Arms: There will he grasp themâthere, with ardent Look, He eyes themâwhile, from 'midst his struggling Sighs, Words burst like theseâ AIR. Together, lovely Innocents, grow up, Link'd in eternal Chains of Brother-Love; For you mayn't Envy bear her pois'nous Cup, Nor Hate her unrelenting Armour prove. He then is silent, then again exclaimsâ Inhuman Brethren! O unhappy Father! What Anguish too much Love for me has cost thee! Such are his Cares, nor have I yet discover'd The fatal CauseâBut once more I'll attempt it. Phan. âThese Men of Canaan too, pretended Brethren, âWho come to purchase Corn, give him Disquiet: âOne of them he detain'd in Bonds as Hostage âFor their Return with Proof they were not Spies; âBut their long Absence makes him doubt their Faith. âI'll to my Lord, and learn this Prisoner's Fate. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. Simeon in Prison. Recitative accompany'd. Where are these BrethrenâWhy this base Delay! To let me languish a whole Year in Dungeons! But are not Brethren base? O Joseph! Joseph! That Thought is HellâRemembrance scorches with it! But was it I alone?âO no!âThen Heav'n Has been at 'compt perchance with my Confederates, Whilst the wild Beast, false-tax'd with Joseph's Death, Has met 'em on the way, and ta'en his Vengeance. AIR. Remorse, Confusion, Horror, Fear, Ye Vultures of the guilty Breast! Now, Furies! now she feels you here, Who gnaw her most, when most distrest. [Exit. SCENE III. Joseph and Phanor. Phan. This Hebrew Prisonerâ Jos. Hither bring him, Phanor. [Exit Phanor. The wide Circumference of Egypt's Regions, The vast Extent betwixt the Nile and Ocean Given me to rule, is Slav'ry, not an Honour; Not Rest, but Travelâ ââYe departed Hours, âWhat happier Moments have I seen!âO Hebron! âWhat Peace enjoy'd amidst thy smiling Valleys! âMight I review thee! might I careless tend âThy fleecy Herd; might I once more embrace âMy good old Sire; list to his sacred Lessons âOf God's Creation, of Man's fatal Fall, âThe Race-preserving Ark, the Heaven-hung Bow, âAnd Hope Divine of Abraham and his Seedâ âIt cannot beâTyrant, enslaving Greatness! âWho'd languish in thy gilded Chains an Hour, âThat in the Courts of Quietness could dwell? AIR. The Peasant tastes the Sweets of Life, Unwounded by its Cares; No courtly Craft, no publick Strife His humble Soul insnares. But Grandeur's bulky noisy Joys No true Contentment give; Whilst Fancy craves Possession cloys, We die thus whilst we live. But Simeon comes, Treach'rous blood-thirsty Brother! Fain wouldst thou had my Life! Cruel! but holdâ I fear, O Heav'n! that some disastrous Death Has snatch'd the other from me, and perhaps Simeon's the only Brother left me now; I'll touch thee notâthe Image of our Father Sits on thy Browânor shall thy Perfidy Dissolve the sacred Ties of Love and Nature. But I will speak such Daggers to thy Soul!â SCENE IV. To Joseph, Simeon. Sim. I tremble at his Presence. Jos. Thou Impostor! Com'st thou before me, but to dare my Fury? Where are thy BrethrenâBrother-Traitors? Ha! Did I not say it? Did I not foresee it? Ye Serpent-Spies! under Pretext of Famine Ye came to see the Nakedness of Egypt. One Year has run its Courseânot yet return'd! Where is their Faith? Impostor, thou shalt pay The Forfeit of their Guilt. Sim. My gracious Lord, Our Testimony's trueâBy Famine driv'n, We hither fled for SuccourâWe're Twelve Brethren, Sons of one Father in the Land of Canaan. Ten thou hast seen, and one is not; the youngest Was to the Care of his old Father left. Jos. The Sight of him might dissipate my Doubtsâ But where's your Promise?âWhy is he not come? Sim. Paternal Love, my Lord, alone detains him. What Anguish must it give the good old Sire, To have this only Hope torn from his Bosom, The Prop and Comfort of his falling Years? How would it shake his poor old tott'ring Frame? How wring his bleeding Heart! Jos. Peace, Nature, Peace! [Aside. Sim. Grief for the Loss of his beloved Joseph, Already reigns too cruel in his Heart; No Sun or sets, or rises on the Earth, That doth not find, and leave him too in Tears. Jos. [Aside.] Great God sustain my Fortitude!â[To Sim.] This Joseph, How died he? Sim. A wild Beast, my Lord, devour'd him. Jos. Devour'd by a wild Beast! Have, have a care! Didst thou then see his bleeding Arteries? His mangled Limbs? Now, by the Life of Pharaoh, I spy some TreacheryâThere are Men on Earth More cruel, Simeon, than the wildest Beast. Sim. Dreadful Discourse! [Aside. Jos. He trembles! [Aside. Sim. Thy Suspicionâ Jos. âIs justâknow you not yet I can divine, And view the dark Recesses of the Soul? In vain from me you'd hide the Truth, Impostor! [Ex. Jos. AIR. Sim. Impostor! Ah! my foul Offence, Wrote in my Face, O dire Disgrace! Admits, admits of no Defence. Tho' treach'rous Hearts from mortal Sight May veil a while Their impious Guile, Heav'n sees, and brings dark Deeds to light. [Exit. SCENE V. Joseph, Asenath. Jos. Whence, Asenath, this Grief that hangs upon thee, And like a Morning Mist which hovers o'er The Violet's Bed, bedews thy lovely Cheeks? Asen. Life of my Life, and Source of all my Bliss, It is but to resemble thee the more. When Zaphnath sighs can Asenath be gay? Can Asenath enjoy, when Zaphnath suffers? AIR. The silver Stream, that all its way Transparent to the Ocean flows, Mix'd with the turbid Surges grows As ruffled and impure as they. Thus glided I through Life's serene, But now dire Griefs thy Breast inflame, My mingling Bosom Shares the same, And I, like thee, am wretched seen. Da Capo. Recitative. Tell me, O tell me thy Heart's Malady, That I may steal it from thee if I can. Jos. A slight Disorderâpublick Caresâ Enter Phanor. Phan. My Lord, The long-expected Strangers are arriv'd, And with them comes a Youth of matchless Beauty. Jos. [Aside.] My Benjamin! Thanks Heav'n! Straight make them enter. [To Phan. My Love, retire a whileâSoon thou shalt know The Business of my HeartâPermit me only Some Moments moreâ Asen. Your Will, my Lord, is mine. [Exit. SCENE VI. Phanor and Joseph's Brethren. Phan. Fear notâPeace be unto youâ'twas your God, That gave you Treasure in your Sacks, for me I had your Money, and declare you Guiltless, Nor think that Zaphnath bears so base a Soul As to condemn you wrongfullyânor one So cruel to refuse you farther Succour. Judah. Thy gracious Words revive my drooping Spirits; And kindly Hope of being guiltless thought Glows in my Heart, and kindles Life anew. AIR. To keep afar from all Offence, And conscious of its Innocence, Is not enough for the Defence Of an unspotted Heart. A light Suspicion oftentimes Of uncommitted unthought Crimes Its Purity with Slander limes, And gives it the Delinquent's Part. Chorus of the Brethren. Thus one with ev'ry Virtue crown'd, For ev'ry Vice may be renown'd. SCENE VII. To them, Joseph, and Attendants. Reuben. Once more, O pious Zaphnath! at thy Feet We pay due Homage, and implore thy Succour. Judah. Our Reverend Sire intreats thee to accept A humble Off'ring of our Country's Fruits; Not such as with thy Grandeur suits, but what Our present wretched State hath leftâO Zaphnath! Our Fields lie desolate, and cover'd o'er With naught but Horror, Barrenness and Drought, Menacing the distress'd Inhabitant With Death inevitable, whose pale Herald Sits on his pining CheeksâO Pity, Pity! Our good old Father sues for Pity from thee; For Pity we implore thee, and for Pity Our youngest Brother lowly bows to kiss Thy bounteous Hand. Benj. This Kiss, my gracious Lord, Comes wash'd with TearsâO save my Country, save My dear, dear Fatherâand may Abraham's God For ever save my Lord. Jos. [Aside.] How his Discourse Melts down my SoulâRiseâis your-Father well? [Aside.] I had almost said MineâThe good old Man Of whom ye spakeâsay, is he living still? Judah. My Lord, thy Servant lives, and lives in Health. Jos. And this his youngest Son? Benj. It is, my Lord, My Name is Benjamin. Jos. Let me embrace theeâ And may that God, my Son, whom thou invok'st, Watch o'er, and ever shed his Blessings on thee! AIR. Benj. Thou deign'st to call thy Servant, Son, And O, methinks, my Lord, I see, With an amazing Semblance shown, My Father's Image stamp'd on thee: Thee, therefore, would I Father call; But the Similitude of Face Is not enoughâthe Soul is allâ O may his Soul thy Bosom grace! Jos. [Aside.] Sweet Innocence! Divine Simplicity! Tears, by your Leaveâ[To Servants.] Attend, prepare our Tableâ âInstantâThese Men shall eat with me to-day. Benj. Let not thy Mercy lingerâGrief and Famine Oppress our aged FatherâAught Delay May fatal proveâWe left him desolate. Jos. [Weeping.] Nature will through the VailâAnguish and Joy Jointly demand my Tears. [Exeunt Jos. Phan. and Attendants. Reuben. Didst thou observe him, Judah?âMark his Looks! Judah. I didâcanst thou interpret them? Reuben. I cannot. Profound and inaccessible, O Judah, Are all the inward Movements of the Great, And never by the Countenance are known. Judah. May great Jehovah turn his Heart to Pity! CHORUS. O God, who in thy heav'nly Hand Dost hold the Hearts of mighty Kings, O take thy Jacob, and his Land, Beneath the Shadow of thy Wings. Thou know'st our Wants before our Pray'r, Then let us not confounded be; Thy tender Mercies let us share, O Lord, we trust alone in thee!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. SCENE I. Asenath, Phanor. Asen. What say'st thou, Phanor! Prove these Strangers then Such base Ingrates? Bore off the silver Cup, That's sacred to my Lord's peculiar Use! Phan. They haveâbut shall not long enjoy their Rapine; Already they are taken, and in Bonds Await their Doom. Asen. Ungrateful impious Men! âWhat Gifts, what Favours did the gen'rous Zaphnath âShow'r down upon them; Honours so unwonted, âYou'd thought this Hebrew Family his own. Phan. âAt his chief Table I beheld them plac'd, âExalted above all the Lords of Egypt; âWhilst from the richest Viands his own Hand âDealt Delicacies to them. Asen. ââOften, Phanor, âThe Bounties and Indulgence of the Great âFall from their Hands by Chance, and, falling, light âAs oft' on the DesertlessâWhy then wonder âTo find them with Ingratitude repaid? AIR. Phan. The wanton Favours of the Great, Are like the scatter'd Seed when sown; A grateful Harvest they create, Whene'er on gen'rous Acres thrown. But, if, as O! too oft', they fall, Where Weeds and Briers the Soil prophane: Or lost, they bear no Fruit at all, Or, bearing, yield a worthless Grain. SCENE II. To them, Joseph. Asen. Whence so disturb'd, my LordâLet not the Crime Of others be inflicted on thyself. Jos. My Sorrows have a deeper, deadlier Root. Asen. Why dost thou hide them then from me?âO Zaphnath, This Diffidence does wrong to faithful Love. Wherefore that Look? Those Sighs?âMuch, much I fear That Asenath's the Source of this Disquietâ Why from her else conceal'dâDire Jealousy, That baneful Viper, rankles in thy Breast. AIR. Ah Jealousy, thou Pelican, That prey'st upon thy Parent's bleeding Heart; Though born of Love, Love's greatest Bane, Still cruel! wounding her with her own Dart. Jos. O wrong me not, thy Zaphnath never harbour'd A Thought that wayâEach Hour I gaze upon thee I view some new Perfections in thy Soul, And find with Transport something more to love. One Moment longer, and I'll lay before thee This only Secret of my anxious Bosom. At present know, my dear old Father lives, Still lives, but inconsolable and wretched. Asen. Whence springs his Misery? Jos. From this cruel Famine, E'en griping Penury, my Love, has seiz'd him; No Succour leftâWhilst, for his dire Affliction, I only shed unprofitable Tears. Asen. But why, my Lord, hast thou not Egypt's Stores, The Wealth of Nations?â Jos. Pharaoh made me not Dispenser, only Keeper of his Treasures; Nor should Corruption cleave unto these Hands, Or would I touch what's sacred to the Publick, To save myself and Race from instant Ruin. Asen. Then call them into Egypt!âWhence, my Lord, This criminal Delay? Jos. I fear the Kingâ Fear Egypt too. Asen. Such Fears are but ungen'rous; You've all the Hearts of Pharaoh and his People. AIR. Jos. The People's Favour, and the Smiles of Pow'r, Are no more than the Sun-shine of an Hour; There Envy, with her Snakes, assails, Here cank'ring Slander still prevails, 'Till Love begins to wain; Oblivion then invelopes all, Our Merits past, and straight our Fall Is stil'd the Publick Gain. [Da Capo. Asen. Art thou not Zaphnath? Is not Egypt sav'd All thy own Work? And won't her Sons with Transport Give a new Life to him who gave thee Life? Jos. âHow could his pious Zeal endure in Egypt âThe impious Adoration paid to Idols, âAnd ev'ry Monster bred beneath the Sky? âWhen all this fair and ample Universe âHas one sole Cause, sole Mover, and sole Good, âThe Source of Truth, Felicity, and Virtue, âWorthy alone to be ador'd and lov'd. Asen. âThat awful Being, with whose sacred Praises âI've heard thy grateful Lips so oft' resound, âI likewise sing!âHere then, secure with us, âThy pious Sire may mingle in the Concert, âNor hear of Egypt's visionary Godsâ I'll instant to the King, and supplicate With Laud for Bounties past, this farther Boon. AIR. Prophetick Raptures swell my Breast, And whisper we shall still be blest; That this black Gloom shall break away, And leave more heav'nly bright the Day. Da Capo. [Exit Asen. Jos. âNow for these BrethrenâWill their smother'd Envy âBreak out anew on the peculiar Favours âI deign'd the Youth?âWill they, with brutal Gripe, âSeize on his seeming Guilt to work his Ruin? âPerfidious Men! I'll prove ye ere I trust ye. âThis Cup shall, like the gen'rous Juice it serves, âLay ope' the Mark, and Bias of your Hearts.â They comeâand Indignation in their Looksâ My Bosom beats with an unusual Pulse. SCENE III. To Joseph, Phanor with the Brethren in Chains. Sim. Whence this vile Treatment! these injurious Chains? For what Transgression are we shackled thus, Like Thieves and Traitors? Phan. That's like what ye are. You've stol'n the sacred Cup that's set apart, For my Lord's Use.â Why have ye thus rewarded Ill for Good? [Exit. Sim. Imposture!âFury!âIf the Sacred Vessel Be found with us, rain Vengeance on our Heads. Jos. Straight we shall seeâand then let the Delinquent Alone receive the Wages of his Guilt. Sim. âIn one we all are guiltyâwith him join'd âBy Blood and Country, with him we'll divide âGrief, Infamy, and Death. Jos. âAh! had you always but pursu'd the Steps âOf pious Jacob, you'd had nought to fear: âBut I can read a Story in your Hearts âThat Time cannot obliterateâa Youth âMost barb'rously betray'd!âan Innocent âTo Strangers sold!âHah! are ye struck!âEnoughâ Heav'n may delay to punish guilty Men, But won't forget them. Reuben., Simeon., Judah. [Aside.] âAh! he surely knows âOur Perfidy. SCENE IV. To them Phanor. Phan. At length the Cup is found. Jos. Where? Phan. Hid, my Lord, amidst thy gen'rous Presents. Benjamin had it. Jos. Benjamin! Benj. I had it! Phan. Behold his Sack, and in it view the Theft. Benj. Am I a Robber? Shield me, righteous Heav'n! Jos. Seize him. Benj. O Heav'n! thou know'st my Innocence! Jos. No moreâ Leave him alone to sufferâAs for you, Go, get you up in Peace unto your Father. Recitative accompany'd. Benj. What! without me? Ah! how return in Peace! What can you say? What Comfort can you yield To the distracted Parent? O unhappy! Unhappy Benjamin! Thou at thy Birth. Gav'st Death unto thy Motherâand now dying, Thou likewise tak'st thy tender Father's Life. ARIOSO. Benj. O Pity!â Jos. [Aside.] âAh! I must not hear. Benj. Not to myselfâ Jos. [Aside.] âBe blind, my Eyes. Benj. My sinking Father!â Jos. [Aside.] âTrait'rous Tear! Benj. O pity him!â Jos. [Aside.] âBe still, ye Sighs. AIR. Benj. Remember, at the first Embrace You call'd me SonâO view this Face; I still as much deserve the Name; Thy Heart alone is not the same. Jos. To Prison with him. Sim. O illustrious Zaphnath, Give room to Pity; thou who rulest Kingdoms, Rule, to thy greater Glory, thy own Spirit: Or to his Father render back the Youth, Or Death to us. Jos. [Roughly.] On whom the Cup was found, him I retain. [Exit. Sim. What, gone! not hear us! Judah. âYet methoughts I saw Some Marks of Pity on his Faceâ Sim. What Pity! Recitative accompany'd. The Man who flies the Wretched, nor will hear them, For fear of yielding to their piercing Cries, Has only Pity for himself. Recitative accompany'd. Judah. Peace, Simeon; Remember Dothan's Fields, the horrid Pit! And Joseph's Cries!âWere we not deaf to them? Then we'd not hearâand now we are not heard. Reuben. What Counsel can we take?âIf we return, Our Father dies with GriefâIf here we stay, With FamineâDeath is either way his Lotâ And black Despair is oursâ Recitative accompany'd. Sim. O gracious God, We merit well this Scourge, but thou art He, Whose Property is ever to have Mercy. Chorus of the Brethren. Eternal Monarch of the Sky, Our cruel Crime thou didst descry, O! with the same all-piercing Eye Our melting Penitence observe. Thou, the Beginning and the End! Creator! Father! Guardian! Friend! Returning Prodigals attend, And grant us Aid we don't deserve. Sim. But Peace, Zaphnath returnsâ SCENE V. To them Joseph. Jos. How! not departed! Ye insolent! away! What foolish Hope?â Judah. Though Fear, my Lord, and Anguish Have nigh lock'd up our Lips, yet would I crave To offer one Word moreâand O! my Lord, Let not thine Anger burn against thy Servant. When drove by dire Necessity to wrest From the reluctant Bosom of our Father, (Ah! with what Force! but such was thy Command) His youngest, dearest Son, his Heart's first Joy! He weeping, thus bespake usâWell you know, This Child's the Prop and Succour of my Age, The only Relick of my Rachel's Bed; Joseph, alas! my much lamented Joseph, In a sad Hour went out, and fell a Prey, As oft' you've told me, to the Tiger's Rage; If then you tear this also from my Arms, And Mischief shall befal himâmy gray Hairs Ye will bring down with Sorrow to the Grave. Jos. [Aside.] My Soul itself now weeps. AIR. Sim. Thou hadst, my Lord, A Father onceâperhaps hast nowâO feel, Feel then for usâas thou didst love thy own, O pity oursâFeel then our Anguish, feel. [Sim.] Give, give him up the Lad In whom his Life is boundâ O let me suffer, Whatever Punishment is doom'd for him; He is too young for Slavery or Stripes; Labour and Years have render'd me more hardy. Recitative accompany'd. Lay all on me, Imprisonment, Chains, Scourges, All, all I can endureâBut to my Father, To be the Messenger of Death I cannot. Jos. [Aside.] I can no longerâPhanor, bring the Youthâ [Exit Phanor, and returns with Benjamin. Far off, ye Guards and Servantsâfrom my Presence Let ev'ry Man departâ[To the Brethren.] Know, I am Joseph. Doth my dear Father live?âI am your Brother; Your long-lost BrotherâI am Joseph. The Brethren. Joseph! Sim. O Heav'n! Judah. Joseph! Sim. Wretched We! [Aside. Jos. Arise: And banish Fearâmy Benjamin, come hither; And let me press thee to my yearning Bosom. Brethren, receive and give a kind Embrace. Benj. âMy Brother Joseph living! Ah! my Father! âWhat Floods of joyous Tears at this glad Tale, âWill wash the Furrows of thy hoary Cheeks? Jos. [To Benj.] Forgive this harmless Stratagem. [To the Brethren.] and ye, Pardon my groundless JealousyâI fear'd You now to Benjamin might prove perfidious, As erst to meâBut I have try'd your Faith. âVirtue's your Guide, Fraternal Love unites ye, âAnd Joseph was your last Offenceâ Sim. O Joseph! Just, yet mysterious, are the Ways of Heav'n. Jos. âSo now, it was not you that sent me hither, âBut God; to be a Father unto Pharaoh, âAnd Ruler of his Land; your Envy thus âConverting to my Grandeur, and the Good âOf half Mankindâ âBut haste ye to our Father, and relieve âHis anxious Spirits. SCENE the LAST. To them, Asenath. Asen. âWhilst the Nile and Memphis, To him and his are destin'd for a Country; Thus Pharaoh has ordain'dâ[To Jos.] Now, my dear Lord, Cast Sorrow from thy Breast. Jos. And thou, my Fair, Disclaim thy Doubts, and no more breathe Suspicion. Asen. Trust me, O Zaphnath, 'twas the Breath of Love. Zaph. Mine too, O Asenath, was still the same. DUETTO. Asen. What's sweeter than the new-blown Rose, Or Breezes from the new-mown Close? What's sweeter than an April-Morn, Or May-Day's silver fragrant Thorn? What than Arabia's spicy Groveâ âO sweeter far the Breath of Love. Hence, Gen'rous Lovers! scorn Alarm, Away Suspicion cast; Beauty and Wit begin the Charmâ âBut Kindness makes it last. Da Capo. Jos. âMy Bliss is now at full, and swells a Tide âOf multiply'd Delights; Wife, Father, Brethren! âAnd thou, my Benjamin! all, all partake âThe glowing fond Affections of my Soul. âSoon we'll resort, and pay our due Obeisance âAt gracious Pharaoh's FeetâBut first of all, With Songs of ardent Gratitude and Praise, Let us approach the high Eternal's Throne, The Fountain of all Joy, all Peace, all Honour. CHORUS. âJehovah, Lord, who from thy Mercy-Seat âDost mark the Movements of this lower World; âThe Virtuous still at last thy Bounties meet, âWhilst from her Pinnacle proud Vice is hurl'd. âTherefore with Angels, and the heav'nly Throng, âLet Man give Laud to thy tremendous Name; âThee seek in ev'ry Prayerâin ev'ry Song, âThy Justice, as thy Goodness, still proclaim. ANTHEM. We will rejoice in thy Salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God. Hallelujah! FINIS.</field>
