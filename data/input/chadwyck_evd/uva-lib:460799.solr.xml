      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene First. —The Port of Rantipolis, the Capital City of the Kingdom of Rumantica—Periwigulus, King of Rumantica, Courtiers, Guards, and Populace discovered. Enter Perfidius, who advances and kneels to the King. Per. Hail, Periwigulus! Brave news I bring! Prince Brutus greets Rumantica's great King. King. Thou comest from the Isles of Peace, which are, In these disjointed times, the seat of war. Per. The war is ended; up the tyrant blown; His crown is crack'd; his throne is overthrown. Prince Brutus fell on him without more fuss, And, to conclude, the victory fell on us. King. Great news! for bringing which this chain receive; Upon the quay we're all on the qui vive. When may we hope to see our son? Per. Before The sun you see goes down he'll be ashore. (gun fires at a distance) King. That signal! Enter an Officer. Officer. Sire, the royal fleet's in sight! King. Run to the ramparts—bid as quick as light The cannonier to fire the cannon there; And let the cannon bid the trumpet blare; And let the trumpet to the kettle shout, The kettle to the ophicleide without; The ophicleide inform the fifes and drums That they should play “the conquering hero comes.” Music—The Fleet is seen approaching the port—cannon, shouts. The barge of Prince Brutus appears, steps are placed, and the Prince lands with his Suite. King. Welcome! thrice welcome! our victorious son, Who for his father a new crown hath won. Prince. Father, you go much farther than is fair; The crown I've won I mean myself to wear. King. How? Prince. On my head! how else d'ye think I'd wear it? King. Ha! have a care! don't joke, for I can't bear it! I am a King who stands no nonsense! none! So don't attempt upon my words to pun, Or you will find you're one of those rash fools Who cut their fingers jesting with edged tools. Prince. (aside) So sharp with me! I'll soon be blunt with you, And make you cut, and in a hurry, too. Music—Princess Carpillona and Dandelina are conducted as prisoners from the galley. King. Who's yon fair foreigner? Prince. A captive maid, Whom I made captive, and am much afraid That she's returned the compliment—for oh, I feel all over—somehow—I don't know! King. A prisoner possessed of such great charms Is very dangerous to take—in arms. Prince. Soon, as my wife, I'll take her, sir, in mine. King. Thy wife! then comes she of a royal line? Prince. She is a princess, distantly related To the usurper I have spifflicated; And who deposed her father years ago, King Placid, called the Easy. King. Say you so? Humph! then, if she consent, we do approve. Prince. If she consent! She'd better, or, by Jove— King. Swear'st thou? Irreverent boy! Peace! thou hadst best. The licence of thy tongue must be suppressed. I shall consult the lady's pleasure first. Prince. (aside) If I don't soon boil over I shall burst! King. Approach, fair Princess, and dismiss your fear; Say, can you love our son, Prince Brutus, here? Princess. Love Brutus! King. Well enough to wed him? Princess. I? King. Many would jump to do so. Princess. Jump! oh, my! Rather than marry Brutus bid me jump From off yon tower, into the ocean plump; Or walk through Smithfield on a market morn, And take the air upon a bullock's horn; Or print a kiss on the unmuzzled mug Of the black bear, that ate the lady's pug; Or the big boa constrictor's cage inhabit, Who took a blanket for a large Welsh rabbit; A fact which many may still remember. It occurred at the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park. Or in a bone-yard with some knacker dwell, And madly play upon the bones, like Pell! The first popular “Bones” of the Ethiopian Serenaders. Things that to hear them told have made me freeze— And I'll much sooner do it, if you please. King. As far as maiden delicacy may Permit a timid maid her mind to say, I think, from what she hints, we can discern Your passion does not meet with much return. Prince. My passion!—oh, my passion she shall feel! Slave! on your marrow-bones for mercy kneel! King. She shall not kneel to thee!—thy slave!—how thine? The army thou hast conquered with is mine! Thou art my officer—my servant—son; And all is mine that's in my service won. Therefore my slave this beauteous maid must be, And I at once make free to make her free! You're your own mistress, and need fear no master! Princess. O, sire! to you I feel I'm bound but faster. Prince. (aside) My prisoner, too! With fury how I frizzle! Out of his prey the tiger who would chizzle, The tiger up may chop! King. What's that you mutter? Mind how you quarrel with your bread and butter. My will is law!—to cross it have a care, Or, in my rage, I may cut off my heir With less e'en than the fifth part of a crown; So gulp your luckless passion quickly down, And henceforth love this maid but as a brother. Prince. (aside) Wouldn't this make a Quaker kick his mother? King. (to Princess) We have not yet heard what thy name is, dear one. Princess. My name is Carpillona. King. What a queer one! Princess. What's in a name? Yours, sir, is Periwigulus, But can that make you any more ridiculous? King. Certainly not! (aside) As wise as she is fair! If I were not turned eighty, I declare I'd offer her my hand; but at my age, To offer her my arm will be more sage. (aloud) Come, Princess, to our palace; you shall be Our guest—your most obedient servant we. Princess. I have a most obedient servant here— My faithful nurse and foster-mother dear. To follow me will you give her the freedom? King. Bring fifty nurses with you if you need 'em! Son Brutus, bear what we have said in mind, Or at our death we'll leave thee but—behind. March—Exeunt King, Princess, Dandelina, and Attendants. Prince. I'll make all right before I'm left behind! The time is apt this business up to wind, And set up for myself against my father. Perfidius! Per. Prince, you appear ruffled! Prince. Rather! Harkye, the King, my governor, must lay down This very night the burden of his crown. Per. He always does, sir, when he goes to bed, And puts a nightcap on his royal head. Prince. Don't to misunderstand my words pretend. Perfidius, I consider you my friend; You must give me a hand that crown to gain. Per. His Majesty has, with this golden chain, Attached me to him, before all beholders! It would lay double guilt upon my shoulders, And dye me of the deepest black ingratitude, If I assumed to him a hostile attitude. Prince. Serve me, and I will pay thee for thy pains, When I am king, by loading thee with chains; About our person thou shalt have the head post, Choose which thou wilt—the lamp-post, door-post, bed-post! First favourite, we'll upon thee put the pot, And make thee our Great Grand High Lord—knows what. Per. Upon your honour? Prince. Bright as pewter platter! Per. That puts a different colour on the matter. The black ingratitude it softens down; I only do one benefactor brown To give the royal purple to a greater; To pause, were to myself to be a traitor. I'm yours, sir! body, soul, and—pantaloons. Prince. Go, sound the troops, then—horse, foot, and dragoons; Offer them double pay and treble rations! Placard the town with flaming proclamations! Spare not for promises, by bushels make 'em, When we are king, 'tis time enough to break 'em. Duet—Brutus and Perfidius—“Pop goes the Weasel.” Per. Promise I'll on promise heap, Easy 'tis to make 'em— Prince. When the time arrives to keep, Easier still to break 'em. Per. “First catch your hare”—for that your tools Amuse with hopes of fees well; Prince. But, having caught it, let the fools Asleep catch a weasel! Prince. Father's reigned quite long enough, Mizzle now I'll make him— Per. He's a king who us will huff, If we do not take him. Prince. He fancies he's uncommonly keen, A bargain he would me sell; But when he thinks it's “all serene,” Pop goes the weasel! (Exeunt Prince and Perfidius) Scene Second. —Interior of a Pavilion in the Royal Gardens—Pages enter and place a regal chair at back. Enter King and Princess Carpillona, attended. King. Sweet Carpillona—while our Court you grace, This poor pavilion we are proud to place At your disposal; call for what you please, My pages shall all serve you on their knees. To you I turn them over. Princess. Can it be? Turn over all your pages, sir, to me! I couldn't have a title to for ages, The dedication of so many pages. King. I've told the cook to serve up a collation, Would make the Lord Mayor lick the Corporation. Princess. A dinner far surpassing my desert. King. If you don't take it, I shall feel quite hurt. Princess. How have I merited so much affection? King. Your features bring back to my recollection A spouse I loved—a child I lost. Princess. Ah me! A daughter? King. No, a son. Princess. Then I'm not he! No matter—pray proceed as you've begun, Tell me the story of your wife and son. King. I will, although my sorrow it revives. I was the husband of two lovely wives. Princess. Two at a time! King. No, one after the other. My first Queen of Prince Brutus was the mother. My second bore me a most beauteous boy. But short— Princess. The child? King. No; short the mother's joy. Stolen, while she slumbered, from her fond embrace, Some demon put a cat in the child's place! She bit the Queen, and on that fatal night She died— Princess. The cat? King. The Queen, of the cat's bite! Princess. Was e'er catastrophe to equal that? King. We hunted for the child— Princess. And hanged the cat? King. Of course! but never found it to this day! Princess. The cat you hanged? King. The child they stole away. Princess. Take comfort, then, perhaps 'tis living still. King. In that fond hope, though faint, I've made my will. Should he turn up— Princess. He's safe to be a trump! And out of joint put his half brother's—hump. King. Half-brothers! they must halve my kingdom too! Princess. Will two half sovereigns be full change for you? King. If both be good. Princess. But should one be a bad one? King. If't comes to pass, the pass will be a sad one— Shouts, crash, uproar, without. Princess. Hark! what is passing now! By all that crashing, I fear already there's a case of smashing! Enter Officer. Officer. My liege, they cry “to arms!” and some queer blades Are blocking up the streets with barricades! We shall not know the city in a minute, They're making such a revolution in it! King. A revolution! Oh, the fact's too plain! The son is breaking out before the reign Is over of his father—though so near up, He couldn't wait with decency to clear up; But I will prove myself a brave old fellow, And brave this tempest—without an umbrella! Enter Prince Brutus and others, armed with blunderbusses, &amp;c. King. Unnatural son! for natural thou wert ne'er! Dost thou so hunger for our empty chair That thou would turn us out when, turned fourscore, Time has so nearly wheeled it to death's door? Prince. Why should you look upon with such alarms A son who comes to you with open arms? King. O, stab me with thy weapons, not thy puns. These arms of thine befit but sons of guns! Why do they threaten here a parent's life? Prince. Because you've seized your heir apparent's wife. Give up my slave, and the new crown I've won, And you may keep your old one. King. May I? done! Princess. Done! Did you say done? Oh, then, I'm done too! King. I couldn't help it! How could I? could you? Princess. And will you give me up to that great brute? King. (corrects her) Brut-us. Princess. Without “us!” King. With us don't dispute! The bargain's struck; be a good child, don't fret; As the bard says, “We may be happy yet.” Prince. Well! Is that foolish girl still contumacious? King. Quite the contrary. Princess. (aside) Oh, my goodness gracious! Prince. Oho! she's to her senses come at last! Then we'll be generous and forgive the past. Let her prepare forthwith to be our bride, To-morrow shall the nuptial knot be tied! Princess. (aside) The nuptial knot be tied! O Fate, than what Worse can betide me if the nuptial's not? March—Exeunt King, Prince, and all but Princess. Enter Dandelina. Princess. My faithful nurse! my dear old foster-mother, Now we're at last alone with one another. Take thou that easy chair, while I sit here And pour my sorrows in thy friendly ear. Dan. Alack, my child, while those sad tears I see No chair can be an easy one to me. Music—She seats herself—The chair turns round, Dandelina disappears, and in her place is seen the Fairy Amazona, dressed precisely like Dandelina. Fairy. (aside) I'll take your place, then—turn about's fair play; I grieve to turn so good a nurse away! But I've turned nurse; for, a good turn to do, There's nothing a good fairy won't turn to. (aloud and imitating Dandelina's voice) Speak, child, I'm listening. Princess. (sitting) I can't for crying! Fairy. Things look a little black, there's no denying, But when they're at the worst perhaps they'll mend. Princess. But what, alas, will be the worst, dear friend? Before I'll be the wife of Brutus made, I'll to my bosom take this truer blade! (drawing dagger) Fairy. That point is one I trust you'll never press. Princess. Then shew me some way out of this sad mess. Fairy. I will. There's one! Music—The scene opens and shews Scene Third. —The Brink of a Precipice—Moonlight—The entrance to a Pine Forest—A large bank. Princess. (as the scene opens) The parting walls recede! “Where there's your will there is a way” indeed. What may this mean? are you a fairy, nurse? Or, mercy on me! are you something worse? Fairy. (appearing in a brilliant Amazonian costume) Fear not! I'm not your nurse, fair Carpillona, But a true friend—the Fairy Amazona. Take this enchanted bunch of gilliflowers; On hostile eyes it has such magic powers, The Prince you fear would not know you from Adam, Or, more correctly, Eve. Princess. But oh, dear madam, You will not leave me here? for still I think I stand upon a precipice's brink! Fairy. You do, I own; but hold fast that bouquet; 'Twill guard and guide you safely on your way Through yonder forest to the verdant meads, In which his flocks the sage Sublimus feeds. Go, look him up! and tell the dear old codger You've come to be a boarder and a lodger; Mention my name and he'll at once believe you, And with his wife, like their own child receive you. Air—Amazona—“Cheer, boys, cheer.” Cheer, child, cheer! those magic flowers retaining, Fearless the dark and tangled forest roam; Cheer, child, cheer! the verdant valley gaining! There you'll find friends out as well as at home. Should hostile eyes behold you on your journey, Press that bouquet, culled by a cunning elf, Its power will, like a power of attorney, Save you the trouble of appearing yourself. Cheer, child, cheer, &amp;c. (Exit Fairy) Princess. So strange does everything around me seem, I can't help fancying I'm in a dream. But if my way lie through yon forest deep, I'd best be walking through it in my sleep. If fays speak truth I needn't care a rush For any beast that may be in the bush. I bear a charm that parry an attack would Of the most savage article in Blackwood. Air—Carpillona—“The Heather Bell.” I'm free to wander o'er the hill, To pass the forest through I'm free; To go, in short, just where I will, I feel myself at liberty. A cottage home I go to share, And through the wood my way I'll wind; I needn't fear a boar or bear, Or any creature of that kind! So with a merry mountain lay, I'll to the verdant valley go; Like Cockney out for holiday— Beyond the sound of bells of Bow! Happy go lucky! I'll take wing, E'en while no pinions me can stay; Nor anxious watch, lest some one spring On me in some uncivil way. These flowers were plucked by fairy stream, And will so change my face and form, That greater pluck from them I seem To pluck to face the coming storm! So with a merry, &amp;c. Prince. (without) This way; I spied a petticoat, I swear! Princess. O mercy! worse than any boar or bear, Fierce Brutus comes! Oh, now or never, gilliflowers, Save me, and prove you're not a bunch of silly flowers. Music—Her dress changes to that of a peasant—Part of the bank changes to a Cow—a milking pail and stool rise near her. Enter Prince Brutus, Perfidius, and Soldiers. Prince. Here she is!—no, she isn't! Naught, I vow, But an old country woman and her cow. Princess. (aside) Old! My kind nosegay, then, has worked a wonder— I'll take the hint. Prince. What a confounded blunder! Harkye! old Bess of Bedlam! Have you seen A Princess pass this way? (she curtsies to him several times but doesn't answer) Speak! what d'ye mean By all that bobbing? Find your tongue and wag That, or I'll find and tear it out, vile hag! Princess. Good, noble gentleman, your pardon, pray! But I can't hear a single word you say. I am stone deaf. Prince. Deaf! hang the stupid dunny! Per. Yes, let us—on this tree. Prince. It would be funny; But I've no time to stop and see her sprawl. Per. Suppose we send her rolling like a ball Down yonder precipice? Prince. Still more amusing, But in the meantime I should risk the losing All chance of catching this ungrateful rover. Per. 'Twon't take a minute, sir, to lift her over That bit of rock. Prince. Then lift her, and be swift. Princess. Colly, my cow, just give that calf a lift. Music—As Perfidius attempts to seize Princess the Cow tosses him over the rock—Thunder and lightning—Prince Brutus and party fly in terror—Princess runs into the wood, Cow sinks, and scene changes to Scene Fourth. —The Verdant Valley—On one side the cottage ornée of Sublimus—A brook runs along the centre, in which Chloe and Phillis are fishing. Chloe. I think we've well performed our morning task, it Has furnished us of fish a pretty basket. If I'd not managed so many to settle, There might have been, of fish, a pretty kettle. Air—Chloe—“La Donna è mobile.” Here to the melody Of Signor Verdi, So often heard I— Fish under hedges, And sometimes all the day Without a nibble, Hear dribble, dribble, The brook through the sedges; And see the little Perch, dace, and tittle- —Bats come and twittle About their trails there. Pleasures so innocent, Who would be changing For the bush-ranging, Washing and dishing? Of those, love of Tin has sent Rambling creation On speculation, In nugget gold-fishing, Where dirty diggers Toiling like niggers, Who fail to cut figures, Cut throats in despair. Enter Sublimus. Sub. Girls, where's your mother? Pastora sings without “Under the Greenwood Tree.” Chloe. Coming at a wish. Sub. She is—and all alive O! like your fish. Enter Pastora from cottage. Sub. Now, my co-partners, in this blest retreat, Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than t'other? Don't it beat, for sport and use, The royal game, as it is called, of goose? Pas. I wouldn't change it. Happy is your grace. Can snap your royal fingers in the face Of fickle Fortune in so sweet a style. Sub. See! I have nearly made this basket while Our daughters here are catching fish for dinner. Pas. And I have been a most industrious spinner; So hand me over all the fish you can, And I'll go fry 'em in the frying pan. Sub. Ennobling sight! upon a Queen to look Who from her throne can thus come down to cook! Pas. Example bright! to see a King forsaking The craft of Courts for that of basket-making. Chloe. Not to say anything of two Princesses Catching the fish their royal mother dresses! Sub. What has become of Corin, by-the-bye? Pas. He's found, perhaps, some other fish to fry. Sub. He has been absent longer than he ought. Pas. He's absent, probably, from want of thought. Sub. I don't know what's come to the boy of late. Pas. What he'll come to it's hard to calculate. Sub. He won't be quiet in the verdant valley, But out of bounds the silly youth will sally Into the wild woods, against brutes much wilder Drawing his bow. Pas. I wish he'd draw it milder. Sub. Well, thank the stars! he never draws the long one! He's truth itself! and that praise is a strong one. Phil. He comes! Chloe. No! some young woman, I declare! Sub. What a fair stranger! Pas. What a strange affair. Enter Princess, as a peasant girl. Princess. Pray pardon this intrusion, but I'm told This is “the Verdant Valley.” Pas. To behold This scene and doubt it, child, would prove that you Are what the vulgar would call verdant too. Princess. Another question, then, to ask I'm bound— Where is an ancient shepherd to be found They call Sublimus? Sub. That's what they call me— My wife, my daughters, and my house you see. Princess. You, sir, a shepherd! and those ladies fair Your wife and daughters—all so rich and rare! I should have thought you gentlefolks! Pas. My dear, All things and folks are gentle you see here. Lo, here the gentle lark, with gentle lay, Gently salutes the gentle dawn of day; The gentle shepherd with his gentle fair Here tend their gentle flocks with gentle care, Or gently stray among the gentle trees, 'Mid gentle flowers that woo the gentle breeze. We even fish with gentles—and we feel To be ungentle would be ungenteel. Princess. “Com' è gentil!”—such exquisite gentility Induces me to say, with all humility, That, if you please, I'm come to board and lodge here. Sub. The deuce you are! (aside) She comes some artful dodge here. Pas. And pray by whom, miss, are you recommended? Princess. A dame by whom I have been much befriended, The Fairy Amazona. Sub. Amazona! As our friend, also, we are proud to own her, And place full confidence in her discretion. Pas. What is your name, young woman, and profession? Princess. My name is Carpillona. I profess Nothing at all. Pas. Then you'll perform no less. I'm not displeased to light upon one such— Young people now-a-days profess so much. Chloe. Then you can't brew or bake? Phil. Or spin or churn? Princess. No; but I shall be very glad to learn. Sub. She can't speak fairer—nor more fair appear, And so, fair maid, you're fairly welcome here. We'll teach you to tend sheep— Chloe. For fish to angle— Phil. Milk cows, feed chickens— Pas. Cook, and wash, and mangle. And not to sell your mangle, mind, to pay For a piano you're not born to play. Oh, there be misses, I have here and there heard, Play in a style that quite out Erard's Erard. Pray you avoid it— Chloe. Corin comes. Sub. At last! Phil. How fast he runs! Pas. I fear he'll get too fast! Music—Enter Corin, with a young roe on his shoulders. Sub. Why, Corin! What a heat the boy is in! Sirrah, where have you all the morning been? Cor. Hunting. Pas. (crosses) What's that you've on your shoulder got? Cor. A roe, that with an arrow I have shot— I know my father is so fond of venison. Sub. Such pious care demands a father's benison! Chloe. Here's a young person come with us to live. (introducing Princess) Cor. (starting) Oh, murder! All. (but Princess) What's the matter? Cor. Pray forgive The sudden transport—something went right through My heart— Princess. (aside) And something went right through mine, too. Pas. You've got the rheumatism, I've no doubt, Rambling those nasty cold damp rocks about. I've known a pic-nic in such horrid chasms Give the whole party an attack of spasms; Of course they laid it to the lobster salad, But I am certain when, in book or ballad, You authors praise such spots in words ecstatic, That for romantic we should read rheumatic. Princess. (aside) If mine of rheumatism was a touch, I don't think I should mind it very much. Cor. (aside) Whate'er the pain, I caught it from that face, And feel 'tis like to be a chronic case. Princess. (aside) Though of young noblemen I've seen so many, This noble young man's handsomer than any. Cor. (aside) Take all the black and blue eyed beauties round, She'd beat 'em black and blue, I'd bet a pound! Pas. But, bless me, I've been talking, and forgot I'd never put the dumplings in the pot! And here's the fish to fry, the cloth to lay. Come, help me, girls, or we shan't dine to-day. And, Corin, mind, now, if you feel that pain About the region of your heart again, I've got some opodeldoc, and desire You'll rub your side with it before the fire; If that will not at once the mischief master, I shall insist upon a mustard plaster. Sestette—Pastora, Princess, Chloe, Phillis, Sublimus, Corin—“Kitty Katty Kino.” Pas. If once it gets into your bones, With a rubdum rum rheumatic kino, It grinds 'em worse than grinding stones, With a rubdum rum rheumatic kino. Prin., Cor., Sub. Sad disaster! Mustard plaster! Won't do much good, I know! All. The cloth go/come and lay, Or we shan't dine to-day. With a rubdum Kitty Katty Kino, Kitty Katty, Kitty Katty Kino! Exeunt Pastora, Chloe, Phillis, and Princess, into cottage. Cor. (aside) A mustard plaster! Oh my heart! I vow Something much hotter's drawing it just now Towards that rustic beauty! Sir, pray who Is our new lodger? Sub. Sir, what's that to you? Cor. I beg your pardon, sir, if I'm to blame, I simply wished to know the lady's name! Sub. 'Tis Carpillona—so upon that score Pray don't be simply wishing any more, Cor. (aside) Oh, Carpillona! I am a gone 'coon! You are the medicine, I am but the spoon! (Exit) Sub. Humph! If my Latin I've not quite lived out, I think old Ovid something says about A pain that very difficult to curb is, And “Nullis medicabilis est herbis.” That's his disease, and one that 'twould be curst hard To cure with opodeldoc or with mustard. Rubbing his side won't touch the peccant part; 'Tis a confirmed affection of the heart. And young miss seems as poorly as young mister; “Aye, there's the rub,” and a perpetual blister For me—for what on earth is to be done? The boy is only my adopted son; And if I suffered him this girl to wed, I might bring—heaven knows what upon my head. Well, as they both were sent by the same fairy, She's bound to get us out of this quandary; So I'll write to her by next magic post. Re-enter Pastora from house. Well, is the dinner ready, wife? Pas. Almost— But I've to shew you such a curious thing; That strange young woman's given me a ring To buy her better clothes—such as we wear. And I suspect her habits need repair; For I'm afraid, and so I think will you be, She couldn't honestly come by this ruby. (shews a ring) Sub. This ruby! Bless my stars! can such things be? Pas. Can you cast any light on what you see? Sub. You make me stare, to think, by any light, That you can on this ruby cast your sight, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, While mine are blanched like almonds! Pas. What wild freaks Are these, sir? Blanched like almonds! For what reasons? Here we are out of reach of plots and treasons; When all is done, you look but on a ring. Sub. Look in it, madam! when I touch this spring, Up, you perceive, the jewel flies, and shews— Pas. A miniature!—ah! sure one knows that nose. Sub. 'Tis mine—so were those curls ere sorrow brought My gray hairs to a wig!—too dearly bought At such a price! And oh, my precious eyes! In them again I feel the waters rise. Pas. I too!—for oh, if mine believe I may, This ring you gave me on our wedding day! And round the neck 'twas fastened of our daughter, When the poor infant perished in the water! Sub. How came that strange young woman by a jewel Which conjures up such recollections cruel? Pas. She says she found it. Sub. She must all declare— Enter Princess from cottage. Pas. She comes; we'll make her tell us when and where. Duet—Pastora and Sublimus—“Oh, tell me when, and tell me where.” Oh, tell me when, and tell me where You found this ruby ring so rare, Or into trouble this affair Is likely you to bring; For it has given us both a shock, To think a girl, in such a frock, Not only at our door should knock, But come with such a ring! Princess. Madam, my story in few words is told; When quite a baby—only six months old— I had the great misfortune to be washed— Sub. Misfortune! to be washed? Pas. You would say squashed. Princess. No, washed, ma'am, overboard and drown'd. Pas. And drown'd! Sub. Where? Princess. In the water. Pas. How, then, above ground, Have we the pleasure of your conversation? Princess. I was indebted for resuscitation To fishermen for carp, who threw a net in; But thought all fish whatever they could get in. They took me for a carp at first—but that As they had saved me—one must not carp at; And, as they couldn't either sell or cook me, Back to the palace, I am told, they took me. Sub. How came you on the water? Princess. O'er a lake My parents their escape were forced to make. The night was dark, the lake was like a sea, And a big billow roll'd o'er little me. Pas. Who were your parents? speak! Princess. The King and Queen Of the Pacific Isles they once had been; But too pacific, of their throne were tricked out, By a usurper—now in his turn kicked out. Pas. It is! it is! with joy I shall go wild! Sub. Away disguise! behold us here, my child! Princess. Us, madam! Sir! Oh, you don't mean— you can't—ah! Sub. I am King Placid! Pas. I, Queen Dominanta! Princess. (embracing them) Ma! Pa! Sub. O, nature!—wondrous is thy power! I feel—it must be past the usual hour At which we dine; and this sweet child, my dear, Has not had bit or sup since she's been here. Enter Phillis and Chloe from cottage. Phil. and Chloe. Dinner's on table. Pas. They, too, must be told. Daughters, your eldest sister here behold! Chloe. Our eldest sister! Phil. Who was food for fishes! Pas. Now to return the compliment she wishes, And feed on some of them. Chloe. Oh, this is prime! Sister, you have just come in pudding time. Princess. (kissing them) I have supped full of happiness so sweet, I only feel that all you I could eat, Nor have for pudding left the smallest corner. Where is my brother? All. Brother! Sub. (to Pastora) We must warn her. Princess. Yes! Brother! Oh, I long to kiss him too! Pas. Kiss him! ahem! No, darling, that won't do. He's not your brother, save by our adoption, Therefore, to kiss him you have not the option. Sub. Nor does he know our real names or quality, So don't imprudently upset our polity. Pas. You've only to remember just at present You're a Princess, and he is but a peasant. Princess. (aside) Not my own brother! Well, it's curious, though I almost think I like him better so. Quintette—Princess, Pastora, Sublimus, Chloe, Phillis—“Summer Flowers.” Princess. With joy the hours too fast will fly! Pas. Our darling cast up high and dry! All. O, such a happy family Who wouldn't pay to view? Princess. Would I four pairs of arms had got, To hug at once the whole dear lot! But, as it happens I have not, My best with these I'll do. Papa! mamma! With joy the hours, &amp;c. (Exeunt into cottage) Scene Fifth. —A Willow Glen. Enter Corin, with paper in his hand. Cor. There runs a rustic rhyme, that “Exercis Is the best thing as is for rheumatis,” And, therefore, I have run like wild to-day, To try if I could make mine run away; But I'm not better—nay, I'm rather worse, For I have had a fit of writing verse. And that's a symptom there is no mistaking— 'Tis love alone has set my heart an aching. Song—Corin—“O give me the girl.” O give me the girl with the blue dress on Papa calls Carpillona; She's stole my heart—away it's gone, Or of no use to the owner! Ye rocks and trees, I'll sing to you About sweet Carpillona. The Bona Roba's stole my heart— A downright robber!—boner! A gem she is without a flaw, As beautiful as Venus, The fairest flower I ever saw Of the Bella-Dona genus. O give me the girl, &amp;c. Her voice to me is sweeter far Than the finest-toned Cremona, Her eyes are each a large loadstar, And draw like a loadstone—Ah! I love her more than Romeo Did Juliet of Verona, Who'd look as black as any crow Beside fair Carpillona! O give me the girl, &amp;c. (sticks paper on tree) Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love! Oh, Carpillona, throughout every grove, With tender compositions, such as these, I'll paper all the trunks of all the trees, And on their barks I'll carve thy dear initial, And register my vows with care official, Deep as my love, to make 'em last the longer— As bark is strengthening, it may make 'em stronger. Cut, Corin, cut! and carve on ev'ry tree A large, a capital, expressive C. Music—He carves the letter C on the bark of a tree—The Fairy Amazona appears—She waves her lance over Corin's head, and he falls asleep on a bank. Fairy. Sleep, thou fond shepherd, by this haunted stream, And of thy lovely Carpillona dream; While here, to counsel on your fate, I wave Aqua Marina from her ocean cave! (waves her lance—Music—Aqua Marina appears) Aqua. 'Gainst wind and tide, all up the stream, and in it, I've floated in the third part of a minute. Fairy. Thanks for your speed. This youth, of course, you know? Aqua. Corin, the younger son of King— Fairy. Just so. He's fallen deep in love, as I intended, With a young Princess, whom you once befriended. Aqua. Ah! I remember, in my arms I caught her When I went to the Lakes for change of—water! Fairy. An angry planet threatens them to part— Aid me to baffle it. Aqua. With all my heart! If to pay me a visit you consent, For here I feel out of my element. Fairy. Agreed! Aqua. We'll gently down the river fall To my marine pavilion—Seaweed Hall. Music—She waves her wand—Water Nymphs appear, and encircle Corin, who sinks, and the scene changes to Seaweed Hall, the marine abode of Aqua Marina. Grand Ballet by Coralina and Sea Nymphs. Tableau.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene First. —The River Side. Enter Princess with a paper in her hand, and in the attire of a shepherdess. Song—Princess—“The deep deep Sea.” O, somebody in love With me must surely be, For the trees where'er I rove Are all carved with C, With a deep, deep C, And it must mean me. For with verses in my praise He the trunks has papered too, And in rhymes all sorts of ways, My poor name contrived to screw. The unhappy man I fear, Is quite himself beside, A shepherd off would shear, With a princess for his bride! O, yes! he must in love Undoubtedly with me Very deep, deep be, Very deep, deep be. I believe, to speak the truth, I'm in love, too, over ears, With that very same fond youth Who so struck with me appears; But, alas! I'm doomed to prove— Truth must not be always told, And his ardent flame above I'm forced to throw water cold. Forced to throw water cold; But, oh! he must in love Undoubtedly with me Very deep, deep be, &amp;c. Princess. Of these strange sights that must the meaning be, On every tree I see—I see a C; And one had got this paper stuck upon it, On which some swain has written a love sonnet; Cupid must surely have bereft of reason The youth who my poor name made rhymes like these on. (reads paper) “Ne'er did Indian nabob own a Jewel like to Carpillona; But as hard as any stone, ah! Is the heart of Carpillona. Either let my heart alone, ah! If you can, fair Carpillona; Or if you can't, give me your own, ah! Which will be fairer, Carpillona.” This is young Corin's lay, I have no doubt, And all these C's of his own cutting out. I'd no idea he was a man of letters; He'd really cut out many of his betters. He knows not of my rank, so this temerity I mustn't censure with too much asperity. Oh! why was I a princess born, or he Not of a line to form a tie with me? He comes! I really think I'll tell him, then. Enter Corin. Pray, shepherd, are these verses from your pen? Cor. Would you were not averse from him who penned 'em! Princess. By such a post how could you think to send 'em? Cor. A poor unhappy shepherd you behold, By love made sheepish, who was once so bold; To her he loves he posts his billet doux, And by a cypher says—I sigh for you! Princess. Shepherd, in love with me you mustn't fall; I'm very sorry for you, and that's all! My heart already has enough to trouble it! Cor. Mine would that trouble share! Princess. More likely double it! Cor. Double it!—then a rival I have got! Princess. You have a rival, shepherd, and you've not— Cor. Oh, speak not in conundrums; I detest 'em! Princess. I've given 'em up—because I never guessed 'em. It is a simple fact—I soon can prove You have no rival, for no man I love; But you've a rival who loves me—the fear Of whom occasioned my arrival here. Cor. Sweet shepherdess, then, why to hope deny me? Princess. Say—can you keep a secret? Cor. Just you try me! Princess. Well, if you'll promise— Cor. By those eyes I swear! Princess. I'll tell you something, then, shall make yours stare! I'm a Princess!—my father was a King! Cor. Oh, mercy!—pray don't tell me such a thing! Princess. It's true—and in Sublimus here, sub rosa, I've found him out—and, in his cara sposa, My royal mother—who, compelled to jog From their own kingdom, settled here incog. Cor. Oh, then, indeed, it is all up with Corin!— Born to a crown, you wouldn't give a florin To be the sweetheart of a poor clodhopper! Princess. You must admit it would be quite improper, For one who boasts of a descent so regal. Cor. Alack, I'm but descended from an eagle! Princess. An eagle! Cor. Yes—found in an eagle's nest, To bring me up there who had done her best; Until, brought down by some intrepid rover, I was brought here to live with cows—in clover. Princess. Then you may be of royal line as well! For if you do not know, how can you tell? Cor. There's much philosophy in that remark— But oh! of Hope I haven't got a spark. Princess. I haven't got a spark myself, but you, Whom my poor heart must not be tinder to. The old quotation now reversed I find, For not so much as kin, you're more than kind. Cor. Can you, then, see my heart thus rent and racked? Princess. Well, no, then, I just can't—and that's the fact! Cor. What do I hear!—roast not a poor lost mutton!— Is't possible for me you care a button? Princess. I have a soul all buttons far above! Murder will out, they say—and so will love; Therefore I own my own, whate'er the onus, And sink pa's policy to save your bonus! Cor. Such an assurance to my heart secures The principal and interest of yours; And on a premium I so highly rate, No duty I can pay will be too great! Princess. In witness whereof to Love's bond this day We each do set our hand— Cor. And our bouquet. (presenting her with his) Duet—Corin and Princess—“La ci darem la mano.” Cor. Mind you don't let your ma know, Or she'll fly out at me, And make your pa say “ah, no!” Which would unpleasant be. Princess. Should chance our love betray, I Tremble! for on that score, What pa and ma will say, I Should really have thought before. Cor. If they object, why, let 'em! Princess. I fear 'twould sadly fret 'em. Cor. They shouldn't be so haughty! Princess. We shouldn't be so naughty! Cor. Away, away! Both. Away with thoughts alarming; The present is so charming! We'll care for nothing more! Enter Pastora. Princess. (quickly, and aside to Corin) My mother! (Exit Corin) Mercy on me!—if she heard— Pas. A vastly pretty duo, 'pon my word! To sing at sight have you been taught the art? Or was that something you have learned by heart? Princess. It's an old air. Pas. And not worth repetition. I don't approve, child, of the composition. 'Twixt you and Corin well it cannot go,— You are too high, and he by far too low. Air—Pastora—“Far, far upon the sea.” As far as I can see, Master Corin makes too free, He's from all that I can gather been so bold As to tell you the same tale Which, throughout the Verdant Vale, I'll be bound to every girl in turn he's told! I watch'd the slyboots glide Through the willows to your side. When a wild young man thus follows you, beware! He'll soft nonsense to you sing, And you, like a silly thing, Believe the words are true to that tender air. Far, far too low is he A maid of your degree To flirt with, as I found him doing here; And if to you he bring Any more duets to sing O.P.H., he shall skip with a flea in his ear. Your cipher here I see He has carved on every tree, And rosy posies all about 'em strung, And posies, too, in rhyme, Which, no doubt, you think sublime, He by their leaves, and yours, I fear, has hung. It will cut me to the core; But, I vow, if any more Of this writing and this cyphering I hear, His letters I shall stop; And in my account you'll drop To a cypher, which, you know, goes for nought, my dear, For, far too low is he A maid of your degree, &amp;c., &amp;c. Princess. Oh, madam, you've discovered all, I find, And so I will confess. Pas. You're very kind— Folks, when discovered, generally do. Oh, Carpillona, I'm ashamed of you!— A girl who in a Court has made a stir To let a shepherd come a courting her!— A Princess who might some day marry some king, To let her heart go bumping for a bumpkin! Princess. Indeed I did my best to choke him quite off, Gave him our true position here a sight of, Explained the distance between him and me, And begged he'd keep his distance—civilly. Pas. What! trusted our state secret to that lad! Despite my warning! this is far too bad! Here comes your father! Oh! what will he say When he hears how you've flung yourself away? Enter Sublimus. Air—Pastora—“Our Polly is a sad slut.” Our policy is upset Completely by our daughter; I almost wish the fishermen Had left her in the water! For she has told about us all We told her not to say— And on a bumpkin all but gone And flung herself away. O, husband, how can this sad blow be parried? Here's Carpillona all but gone and married! Sub. To whom? Pas. To Corin she's herself contracted, And as if bent to drive us quite distracted, After of caution she had such a dose To keep the tale of our misfortunes close, To him, whose bump of caution is so small, She's gone and let the cat out—tale and all! Sub. How!—let the cat out of the bag!—I wonder, So shrewd a girl should make so great a blunder; Not to perceive you should—to 'scape scanmag— Have kept the cat and given him the bag! Princess. Alas! while hearing him his passion plead I quite forgot myself. Pas. You did indeed!— Go tell him we forbid the banns—refuse A licence— Sub. Yes, because— Pas. Because we choose! Kings give no reasons—subjects must submit. “Sic volo sic”—what? (to Sublimus) Sub. “Jubeo.” Pas. That's it! Princess. 'Twill break his heart and mine! Pas. Romantic stuff! Sub. Suppose it should—time mends 'em fast enough; And, as your common sense with age increases, Of both your hearts you'll find you've saved the peaces! Pas. Begone! Princess. It is my duty to obey. (Exit Princess) Sub. Another moment I had given way! I can't resist a pretty woman's tears! Pas. Fie! for shame, sir—a person of your years! But thus it ever was, when on your throne, To resist anything you ne'er were known. King of the Peaceful Isles—you hoped to stay so, And thought to keep the peace you'd but to say so! No army—we were quite out of harm's way, No navy—if it wasn't spelt with K. Let me honestly own this joke was the late Baron Alderson's So when from off the throne your cousin shook us, Our own peace officers to prison took us! Sub. How could I dream— Pas. Because you went to sleep, And not one eye would even open keep. There is no terror in a monarch's nod, Who isn't wide awake; and now the rod You'd spare and spoil the child—I know you would! You'd patch this matter up as best you could, And let our daughter marry this young foundling, Rather than stand your ground against this groundling! (she turns away) Sub. Hear me! one word! my love—indeed, you'll find In this affair I have not been so blind. I saw the boy was struck with Carpillona, And posted off a note to Amazona, Her own opinion on the case to learn. The Fairy Amazona appears from tree. Fairy. And Amazona answers by return. Is't thus you would repay the obligation You're under for your daughter's restoration, By forcing her with tears her love to wipe out, And putting thus her faithful shepherd's pipe out? Pas. You wouldn't have us, sure, the piper pay For our dear daughter in so dear a way? Bestow the pet lamb of our royal flock On a mere rustic found upon a rock! A girl who can a king her father call, On the poor son of nobody at all! I'll tell him to his head, if he provoke it, To put that in his shepherd's pipe, and smoke it! Fairy. Ha! Sub. Madam! Great Fairy—I am sure—the Queen— Your Fairyship must feel—she didn't mean— Pas. I did— Sub. Not! no—of course! just so! I knew— (aside) There'll be a scrimmage now, between the two. (aloud to Fairy) A mother's anxious feelings got the better, They ran away with her—and so—upset her— That she—that is—that I—I mean, that you— You understand—at least, I hope you do! Fairy. Short-sighted mortal, with your poor weak eyeglass, Peering through mists which mock the longest spyglass! What if the noble-minded youth you scorn Should be as nobly as your daughter born? Pas. Ah! then, indeed— Fairy. I don't assert the fact, But I command you instantly retract Your cruel mandate! Corin is my care As much as Carpillona—they're a pair Not to be matched again, if one be lost, And sure as fate you'd have to pay the cost. Pas. Madam, with due submission— Sub. Yes; submission, We bow, most potent Fay, to your decision. It shall be done, I say— (aside and looking at Pastora) She don't object! (aloud) I say it shall be done as you direct. Fairy. Enough! one planet still appears malignant; But that escaped, the rest are all benignant; So quickly as 'twas made this rent repair, For I perceive you've not much time to spare. (music—Fairy Amazona disappears in tree) Sub. You—we've been in the wrong—a little bit. Pas. (aside) I may have been, but catch me owning it! (aloud) “The King can do no wrong.” If true that be, How can his better half do worse than he? Besides, if Corin be of high condition, There's no occasion for our prohibition. Why didn't she drop such a hint before, When he was dropped an infant at our door; Found in an eagle's nest amongst the rocks, Without as much on as a pair of—socks. I think I see him now! Sub. And so do I! And I remember seeing, by-the-bye, Upon his arm a mark, of crimson red. Pas. There was—the semblance of an arrow-head. Sub. Upon which head I said, by way of lark, He certainly was somebody of mark! And you replied you hoped we shouldn't find An arrow-head mark of a narrow mind! Pas. I perpetrate so vile a pun, sir? Never! Sub. You did indeed! We all thought it so clever, And laughed excessively. Pas. I don't dispute I said I'd bring him up on arrow-root; But not in joke, nor did the child so take it, But seriously as fast as I could make it. Sub. However, with that arrow now our aim Must be to hit the mark; an archer game We have to play than that of yore we played, When for Fate's arrows we the butts were made, And should have been like rubbish shot full soon, If we had not that fine night shot the moon. Enter Phillis and Chloe. Phillis and Chloe, you come apropos, To find your sister and young Corin go. Pas. Say we would speak with them. Sub. I say, suppose Corin should be a king! Chloe. A king! Sub. Who knows? And then suppose— Pas. Suppose you cease supposing! It's like the song the niggers in a row sing. Quartette—Pastora, Sublimus, Chloe, Phillis—“Commence you darkies all.” I'm such a puzzle in Supposing so and so; I almost to doubt begin Whether I'm myself or no. To know ourselves, they say, It's very hard to do, So suppose we only may Have supposed ourselves we knew! So much in the dark we're all, It really out may fall Ourselves, ourselves we have no right to call. Suppose that I was you, Suppose that you was me, Suppose we all were somebody else, I wonder who we should be! (Exeunt) Scene Second. —A Wood. Enter Prince Brutus and Soldiers bearing a dead bear. Prince. “Another fine bear slaughtered,” as they say At all the barbers' shops from day to day. I've had great sport, and yet I don't feel sportful; In vain with riot I have filled the Court full. In vain throughout the realm I rule the roast, And mind my father no more than a post. I can't get rid of a sensation queer— Of something always whispering in my ear. “What did you with your baby brother do?” It's no use answering, “What's that to you?” I am so bored with the eternal query, That I'm not jolly even when I'm beery. Song—Prince—“I'm a Gent, I'm a Gent.” The original words were sung by Mr. Wright in a piece by Stirling Coyne. I'm a prince, I'm a prince, though I'm not so well made As some I have seen in full puff on parade. If I'm not quite a swell from the top to the toe, I've a bend in my back that should make me a beau! And although I've a sort of a cast in my eye, Wherever I cast it, in terror folks fly! Then thus to be bullied by conscience 'tis hard; I might just as well be a common blackguard! I'm a prince, I'm a prince and vice regal my style! Yet bored with the blues like a villain so vile. If like vulgar rogues I at conscience must wince, What the deuce is the use of one's being a prince! I of my stepmother got cleverly rid, I kidnapped my brother when quite a young kid! By a pal I could trust he was artfully bagged; And I've reason to hope he was decently—scragged! I now of my father have bothered the gig, And left him with scarcely a crown to his wig! And after all this, ain't it rather too bad I should ever feel even approaching to sad? I'm a prince, I'm a prince, and vice regal my style! Yet bored with the blues like a villain most vile. If like vulgar rogues I at conscience must wince, What the deuce is the use of one's being a prince! Enter Perfidius cautiously. Per. Your—Highness! Prince. Well, what fresh game have you started? Per. Fair game—the dear— Prince. What deer? Per. Your dear departed. Prince. What do you mean by this mysterious mumbling? Per. The Princess Carpillona— Prince. I feel—tumbling! Art sure? Per. Cock sure! Prince. And not made sure of her? Per. I was alone—she with a lover, sir. Prince. A lover! and you've left her with him living! Per. That you might have the pleasure, sir, of giving The coup de grace; they follow close at hand, So please your Highness here to take your stand, And seize the deer—on the young fox we'll rush Behind, and so be ready for a brush. Music—Prince and two of the Huntsmen retire behind trees—Perfidius steals off with the rest, as Princess enters, followed by Corin. Princess. Follow me not—I've told you my relations Forbid our following our inclinations. Cor. You lead this heart, and I must follow suit. Princess. My father's will you'd not have me dispute? Cor. Yes, for he couldn't have been compos mentis When such a will he made! Princess. That argument is Opposed to every sense of filial duty! Urge me no more. Cor. (passionately) Thus, then, too cruel beauty, I cast from out my breast the flow'ry token Of promise made, like pie-crust, to be broken! (taking nosegay of gilliflowers from his vest and flinging it from him) Princess. Rash Corin! Do not fling those flowers away, There is a charm in them. (as she runs to pick them up the Prince picks them up, intercepts, and seizes her) Prince. My charmer! stay. Princess. Brutus! Oh, Corin! I am lost! Cor. (fiercely) Unhand her! Prince. (to his Men) Seize him! the sauce for goose is sauce for gander: Princess. Fly! Corin, save yourself! Cor. Yes, with a hook! (branaishing his sheep-hook) As I will you. Prince. (to the Men, who fall back) Shrink from a shepherd's crook? Look to the girl! This rascal's skull I'll crack. (advancing on Corin) Cor. A crook in hand is worth two in the back. (knocks down the Prince and belabours him) Prince. Oh! I'm an ass—assassinated man! Cor. One syllable of that believe I can. Release her (to the Hunters who have seized Princess), or I'll serve you both the same. Enter Perfidius and his party behind Corin—They seize and disarm him. Per. Will you? Cor. Ah, knaves! Per. The last trick wins the game. (to Prince, while raising him) How fares your Highness? Prince. In a shocking state. Head-broken and back beaten almost straight; But joint from joint I'll have the traitor torn, Or burnt alive, as sure as he is born. And feast my ears in turn upon his groans— (two Attendants support Prince) Oh! gently, gently, pray! over the stones. Music—They carry out Prince, followed by Perfidius with Corin and Princess, prisoners. Enter Sublimus and Pastora. Sub. For help I heard a cry. Pas. Ah! woe on woe! Our daughter carried off by Corin! Sub. No! Pas. I tell you yes; there they both go together. Sub. They do; but 'pon my life I can't tell whether He's carried her off, or she's carried him, For he is bound, and led by ruffians grim. Pas. And she's bound too; but whither she's bound to, Who knows? and you stand there— Sub. What can I do? Pas. What can you do? Run after them, and stop 'em. Sub. It's easy to say run—(calling) Ho! you, sirs, drop 'em. Pas. They mock our agony. Sub. They laugh outright at us. Pas. And see, one low-bred fellow takes a sight at us. Oh! that I were a man! Sub. I wish you were, For his sake only—not for mine. Pas. Despair Inspire me now with forty-lion power! And railroad speed of forty miles an hour! I'll follow them in spite of all resistance! Sub. I'll follow you—at a respectful distance! (Exeunt) Scene Third. —A Room in the Palace of King Periwigulus —Guards enter and place chairs, then exeunt. Enter King. King. So shaken as we are—so wan with care, We're but the shadow of the King we were; Though still a crown upon our wig is worn, Though still a sceptre in our hand is borne, We're but the satellite of our own son— A sort of Twelfth Night King—without the fun. A monarch on his subjects forced to wait; A ruler ruled himself by far too straight; A sovereign clipped so close, he scarce can ring; A poor old gentleman, whose name is King, And might as well be Brown, or Jones or Smith, For all the reverence he's treated with. Oh, had my second son to me been spared, My first to treat me so had never dared! My second then had been my first, and sole Proprietor, my crown had been my whole. It's quite a riddle! Time must be the solver, Who's riddled my poor heart with his revolver! Flourish without—Enter Officer. What means that flourish, sir? Officer. Prince Brutus comes! King. That trumpet of my ears offends the drums! Nothing now flourishes, alas! for me! Enter Prince leaning on Perfidius. King. Brutus! Prince. O dear! King. What can the matter be? Prince. A matter of high treason!—I've been struck, Received a topper, which was not for luck, From a vile villager—a shepherd slave! King. How came the man so badly to behave? Prince. He dared to step between me and my prey. King. What, pray? Prince. The false, ungrateful runaway! King. The Princess Carpillona! Prince. Yes, I've caught her; And catch me giving her the slightest quarter! If she my fingers can again slip through, It won't be in her skin, I promise you; For I will strip it off her back! King. You wouldn't Be so indelicate! I'm sure you couldn't! Prince. Bring in the prisoners, sir! (to King) You'll please to try And find 'em guilty—death! King. I please? not I! Prince. You're King, and must on traitors justice do. King. But you are viceroy over me. Prince. That's true; And, therefore, I command you, in your name, To play the king, or to give up the game; And I will take your hand, and vengeance deal On the whole pack of you! King. Then I must steel My heart to pity—up to aid me summon All the stern virtue of an ancient Rum-'un! Prince. In both the cases I am prosecutor— But of the judge I'm also coadjutor; So on the bench I sit to see the sport. (they sit) King. Here come the prisoners! Music—Enter Princess and Corin, guarded. Prince. Silence in the court! King. Which case stands first? Prince. As one's a lady's case, Of course the other must to hers give place. King (to Princess) What is your name? Princess. Oh, sire! you know me well. King. Justice is blind!—I can't see—so can't tell. Princess. 'Tis Carpillona! Hear me, sire, I pray! Prince. Justice is deaf to all that you can say. King. With what offence do you charge this young woman? Prince. Being found out. King. One not at all uncommon! But very serious; for, as she's found out, That she is guilty there can't be a doubt; And so we sentence her at once to go Where she can't be found out again! Prince. No, no! That sentence may not pass—no more shall she. Convict! but leave her punishment to me! King. Arrest of judgment in this cause is prayed; The judge has no discretion, I'm afraid. Princess. 'Tis not, alas, the only Quarter Session In which I've found the judge had no discretion! King. Call on the next case. Prince. The King versus Corin! Cor. He, versus! What on earth's the King brought for in? King. A legal form, of which I'd waive the flattery. Prince. This case, my lord's, one of assault and battery. The indictment sets forth said defendant Corin Did wilfully and malice thought afore in With a stick in his hand value one bob Strike, beat and damage seriously the nob Of plaintiff, and said stick around him swing Against the peace of our said Lord the King! King. How say you, pris'ner at the bar—are you Guilty or not guilty? Cor. It's all quite true— Just loose this hand, and give me a stick in it, I'll shew you how I did it in a minute! Prince. No need of such a proof—he owns his crime, And of the Court we'll not take up the time. His doom is death! King. The deed can't be defended— (rising) But he's to mercy strongly recommended. Prince. Leave him to mine! that's all the law I crave. Princess. O, spare him, sir, and I will be your slave! Prince. You are my slave! and as my slave shall share His punishment! (Enter Perfidius) Perfidius, in the square, Before the palace—quick; a pile and stake. A bonfire of both spark and flame I'll make. (Exit Perfidius) King. What, Carpillona! sure you won't have roasted, A beauty whom so lately you'd have toasted? Prince. I will. Princess. And you, sir, (to King) will stand by and view it? King. Oh no! I'll go to supper while they do it. Prince. You shan't! I order you to see it done. King. No, burn me if I do! Prince. That may be one Of those true words, spoken sometimes in jest, Therefore obey, without one more—you'd best! King. (aside) Of horrors was there ever such a tissue? Prince. A writ of fiery facias I issue, So take their bodies, officer, and bring Them after—with our Sovereign Lord the King. Quartette—Princess, King Periwigulus, Corin, and Prince— “On yonder rock reclining”—“Fra Diavolo.” Princess. (to King) To interfere declining, Can you our frizzling forms behold, And their hands not bid them hold, You, my best friend of old? To pity, sir, inclining, Cold water on this project throw. And your petitioner, you know, Ever shall pray—just so! Prince. Tremble! E'en now the logs they're piling, On which you'll soon be briling. King and Cor. The devil, O! the devil, O! the devil, O. Cor. (to Prince) Your ill-got power abusing, Although on me you spit your spite, Towards this royal fair you might Be rather more polite. It may be most amusing To roast a man who basted you; But sure to fry this sweet soul, too, Is not the thing to do. Prince. Tremble! Well pepper'd for her sake, In turn of her broil'd bones I'll make A devil, O! a devil, O! a devil, O! King, Corin, and Princess. The devil, O! the devil, O the devil, O! (Exeunt) Scene Fourth. —The Square before the Palace, a terrace of which commands a view of the place—Night—In the centre a pile of faggots and a stake—Guards, commanded by Perfidius, are discovered completing the preparations for the execution by torchlight. Enter Pastora and Sublimus. Pas. Thus far, beneath the blanket of the dark, We've crept into the town without remark; But on the hope our daughter back to get, The blanket fortune throws is very wet. What's going forward in this public square? Sub. To ask that officer d'ye think we dare? Pas. I think I dare. (to Perfidius) Sir, will you be so civil As to say what you're at? Per. Go to the devil! Pas. Thank you! I feel assured, from all I see, No one knows more about your work than he. Per. Ha! ha! the woman thinks herself a wit. Well, if you want to know, just wait a bit. These faggots soon will throw sufficient light Upon the subject of our work to-night. Sub. (aside to Pastora) What is to-day? I really don't remember; Perhaps the fifth, it may be, of November, And they're about to burn a guy. Pas. If true, My dearest husband, don't let them see you! Sub. Don't be alarmed! for look, they've two guys greater. Enter King Periwigulus, Prince, and Guards. Prince. Is all prepared? Per. All, sir. Prince. Drag forth the traitor! He shall fry first, before the false one's eyes! Enter Corin, guarded. Sub. 'Tis Corin! Pas. Oh! then—horrible surmise! The other victim is our daughter! Enter Princess, guarded. Yes! Oh! but they don't suppose that I'll stand this! (advancing) Hold! Prince. Who says, Hold? Pas. I do! Prince. Take hold of her! Princess. My mother! Prince. How! Queen Dominanta! Pas. Sir! I am that injured individual; And with my royal husband here now call Upon the Sovereign of this mighty State For his protection. King. You have called too late! I'm not at home—I say it to my sorrow— In my own palace! Prince. Call again to-morrow! Quick to the stake with him! Sub. All right he spurns! Pas. Is there no justice in this land? Prince. Yes, “Burns!” Cor. (as they bind him to the stake, raising his bare arm towards Prince) Base tyrant, mark me! King. Ha! stand so! keep steady!— Mark thee!—some one has marked thee, boy, already! What mark is that upon thine arm I see? Cor. An arrow-head. King. Oh, Fortune! can it be? Pas. It can! though what it can be I've no notion. King. One question—I can't ask it for emotion— Young man!—thy father!—who and what was he? Cor. I never had one! King. Then it must be me! Prince. What stuff is this? King. A fact no stuff can smother! Release my son! Brutus, behold thy brother! Prince. 'Tis false! the brat was strangled when a baby. King. How do you know? Pas. Because he did it, may be! Sub. Or tried to do it! King. Ha! he's conscious smitten! Who dress'd up in long clothes a nasty kitten, And stole his little brother? All. (groaning) Oh, oh, fie! Prince. Well, if you come to that, then—know 'twas I! And of my birthright ere I moult one feather, I'll see you all—burned in a lump together! Perfidius! while the iron's hot let's strike it! (music—Guards and Perfidius seize King and all the party—Fairy Amazona appears) Fairy. Burn first yourself, and just see how you like it. Prince and Perfidius sink in flames, together with the pile, &amp;c. King. (to Fairy) For this relief, much thanks. Upon our knees— Pas. That's what I call “Burns' Justice,” if you please! Fairy. Great King, receive your son—from ruffian hands Snatched by an eagle—and, by my commands, Brought up in in safety by this royal pair!— To whom I now restore their kingdom fair— The Peaceful Isles. Pas. Our reign will never cease So long as your kind hands preserve this piece! (music—Change to last scene) Finale—“Summer Flowers.” 'Mid all the bright and pleasant things That merry Christmas round you brings, “Once on a Time there were Two Kings,” We trust a place may gain. If they in aught to your delight, Have ministered this trial-night, Oh, give the royal pair a right In triumph long to reign. CURTAIN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Song—Princess—“The deep deep Sea.” O, somebody in love With me must surely be, For the trees where'er I rove Are all carved with C, With a deep, deep C, And it must mean me. For with verses in my praise He the trunks has papered too, And in rhymes all sorts of ways, My poor name contrived to screw. The unhappy man I fear, Is quite himself beside, A shepherd off would shear, With a princess for his bride! O, yes! he must in love Undoubtedly with me Very deep, deep be, Very deep, deep be. I believe, to speak the truth, I'm in love, too, over ears, With that very same fond youth Who so struck with me appears; But, alas! I'm doomed to prove— Truth must not be always told, And his ardent flame above I'm forced to throw water cold. Forced to throw water cold; But, oh! he must in love Undoubtedly with me Very deep, deep be, &amp;c. Princess. Of these strange sights that must the meaning be, On every tree I see—I see a C; And one had got this paper stuck upon it, On which some swain has written a love sonnet; Cupid must surely have bereft of reason The youth who my poor name made rhymes like these on. (reads paper) “Ne'er did Indian nabob own a Jewel like to Carpillona; But as hard as any stone, ah! Is the heart of Carpillona. Either let my heart alone, ah! If you can, fair Carpillona; Or if you can't, give me your own, ah! Which will be fairer, Carpillona.” This is young Corin's lay, I have no doubt, And all these C's of his own cutting out. I'd no idea he was a man of letters; He'd really cut out many of his betters. He knows not of my rank, so this temerity I mustn't censure with too much asperity. Oh! why was I a princess born, or he Not of a line to form a tie with me? He comes! I really think I'll tell him, then. Enter Corin. Pray, shepherd, are these verses from your pen?</field>
