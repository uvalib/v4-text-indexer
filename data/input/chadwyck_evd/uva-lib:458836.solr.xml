      <field name="fulltext">Enter King Edward, the Dutches of Yorke, the Queen, the Lord Howard, and Sir Thomas Sellinger. Dutchesse. Sonne, I tell ye you haue done you know not what: King: I haue married a woman, else I am deceaued mother. Dutch. Married a woman? married indeed, Here is a marriage that befittes a king: It is no maruaile it was done in haste, Here is a Bridall and with hell to boote, You haue made worke? King. Faith mother some we haue indeede, but ere long you shall see vs make worke for an heyre apparant I doubt not, nay, nay; come, come, Gods will what chiding still? Dutch. O God that ere I liude to see this day. King. By my faith mother, I hope you shall see the night too, and in the morning I will bee bolde to bidde you to the Christning, Grandmother, and Godmother to a Prince of Wales, tutte mother, tis a stirring world. Dutch. Haue you sent Warwicke into France for this? King. No by my faith mother I sent Warwicke into France for an other, but this by chance being nearer hand, and comming in the way I cannot tell how, we concluded, and now (as you see) are going about to get a young king. Dutch. But tell me sonne how will you answere this? Ist possible your rash vnlawful act, Should not breed mortall hate betwixt the Realmes? What may the French king thinke when he shall heare That whilst you send to entreate about his daughter, Basely to take a subiect of your owne? What may the Princesse Bona thinke of this? Our noble Cosin Warwicke that great Lord, That Center-shaking thunderclap of warre, That like a Colum propt the house of Yorke: And boare our white Rose brauely in his top, When he shall heare his embassage abusde, In this but made an instrument by you, I know his soule will blush within his bosome, And shame will sit in Scarlet on his Brow, To haue his honor toucht with this foule blemish, Sonne, Sonne I tell you that is done by you, Which yet the child that is vnborne shall rue. King. Tush mother you are deceiude, all true subiectes shall haue cause to thanke God, to haue their king borne of a true Englishwoman, I tell you it was neuer well since wee matched with strangers, so our children haue beene still like Chickens of the half kind, but where the cocke and the hen be both of one breed, there is like to be birdes of the game: heare you mother, heare you, had I gone to it by fortune, I had made your sonnes George and Dicke to haue stood gaping after the crowne: this wench mother is a widdow, and hath made proofe of her valour, and for anything I know I am as like to doe the deed as Iohn Gray her husband was, I had rather the people prayd to blesse mine heyre, then send me an heyre: hold your peace, if you can see, there was neuer mother had a towarder sonne, why Cosen Howard and Tom Sellingere heard you euer, such a coyle about a wife. How. My soueraign Lord with patience beare her spleen Your princely mothers zeale is like a riuer, That from the free aboundance of the waters, Breakes out into this inundation, From her aboundant care this rage proceedes, O'er swolne with the extremity of loue. Sellin. My Lord, my Lord, auoide a womans humor, If you resist this tumor of her will, Here you shall haue her dwell vpon this passion, Untill shee iade and dull our eares againe: Seeme you but sory for what you haue done, And straight sheele put the finger in the eye, With comfort now, since it cannot be helpt: But make you show to iustifie the act If euer other language in her lips, Then out vpon it, it is abhominable, I dare be hangde, Say any thing it makes no matter what, Then thus be wearied with a womans chat. Dutch. I, I, you are the spaniels of the Court, And thus you fawne and sooth your wanton king, But Edward hadst thou prizde thy maiesty, Thou neuer wouldst haue stainde thy princely state, With the base leauings of a Subiects bed: Nor borne the blemish of her Bigamy. A widdow, ist not a goooly thing? Grayes children come aske blessing of the king, Queen. Nay I beseech your Grace my Lady Yorke, Euen as you are a Princesse and a widdow, Thinke not so meanely of my widdowhoode, A spotlesse virgin came I first to Gray, With him I liude a true and faithfull wife: And since his hie emperiall maiestie, Hath pleasd to blesse my poore deiected state With the high Soueraigne title of his Queene, I here protest before the host of heauen, I came as chaste a widow to his bedde, As when a virgin I to Gray was wed. King Come, come haue done, now you haue chid inough, Gods foote, we were as merrie ere shee came, as any people in Christendome, I with the mistris, &amp; these with the maids: onely wee had no fidlers at our feast, but mother you haue made a fit of mirth: welcome to Grafton mother, by my troth you are euen iust come as I wished you here, let vs to supper, and in Charitie giue vs your blessing ere wee goe to Bedde. Duch. O Edward, Edward, flie and leaue this place, Wherein poore sillie king thou art inchaunted, This is her dam of Bedfords worke her mother, That hath bewitcht thee Edward my poore childe, Dishonour not the Princes of thy land, To make them kneele with reuerence at her feete, That ere thou didst empale with soueraintie, They would haue scorned to haue looked vpon, Theres no such difference twixt the greatest Peere, And the poore silliest kitchin maide that liues, As is betwixt thy worthines and hers. Queene I do confesse it, yet my Lady Yorke, My mother is a Duchesse as you are, A Princesse borne, the Duke of Bedfords wife, And as you know, a daughter and a sister, Unto the royall bloud of Burgundie. But you cannot so basely thinke on me, As I do thinke of these vaine worldly titles, God from my soule my sinne as farre deuide. As I am farre from boasting this in pride. Selling. Madam, she is the mirror of her kind, Had she but so much spleene as hath a gnatte, Her spirits would startle to abide your taunts, She is a Saint, and Madam you blaspheme, To wrong so sweete a Lady. Duch. Thou art a minion and a flatterer. Sellen. Madam but that you are my soueraigns mother, I would let you knowe you wrong a gentleman. Howard Good Cosin Sellinger haue patience, Her Graces rage by so much violence, Hath spent it selfe alreadie into aire, Deere Madam I beseech you on my knee, Tender that louing kindnes to the Queene, That I dare sweare she doth in soule to you, Edw. Wel said good Cose, I pray thee make them friends: why how now Besse, what weep? nay then Ile chide you, what sodaine newes comes by this messenger? Enter a Messenger. Mes. My soueraigne Lord, the bastard Falconbridge, Of late hath stird rebellion in the South, Incouraging his forces to deliuer, King Henrie late deposde out of the Tower, To him the malcontented commons flocke, From eueries part of Sussex, Kent, and Essex, His armie waxed twentie thousand strong, And as it is supposde by circumstance, Meane to take London, if not well defended. Edward Well let this Phaeton that is mounted thus, Looke he sit surely, or by Englands George, Ile breake his necke, this is no new euasion, I surely thought that one day I should see, That bastard Falcon take his wings to mount, Into our Eagle airy, me thought I saw, Blacke discontent sit euer on his brow, And now I see I calculated well, Good Cosin Howard, and Tom Sellinger, This night weele spend in feast and iollitie, With our new Queene, and our beloued mother, To morrow you shall haue commission, To raise vp powre against this haughtie rebell: Sirra depart not till you know our pleasure, You shall conuey vs letters backe to London, Unto the Mayor, Recorder, and our friends, Is Supper readie? come by my bonnie Besse, Welcome mother, we are all your guests. Exeunt. Enter Falconbridge with his troupes marching, Spicing, Smoke, Chub, and others. Fal. Hold drumme, 1 Spi. Hold drumme and be hangde, 2 Smoke Hold drumme hold, peace then ho, silence to the 3 proclamation. 1 Spi. You lie you rogue, tis to the oration. Chub. Nay then you all lie, it is to the coblication, Fal. True hearted English and our valiant friends, all Ho braue general yfaith. Spi. Peace there you rogues, or I will splitte your chaps: Fal. Deare countrimen, I publikely proclaime, If any wronged discontented English, Toucht with true feeling of King Henries wrongs, Henrie the sixt the lawfull King of England, who by that Tyrant Edward the Usurper, Is held a wretched prisoner in the Towre, If any man that faine would bee enfranchisde, From the sad yoake of Yorkish seruitude, Under which we toyle like naked Gallyslaues, Know he that Thomas Neuill the Lord Falconbridge, all I I a Faconbridge a Faconbridge: Spici. Peace ye clamorous rogues, on Generall, on with your oration, peace there, Fal. Pittying King Henries poore distressed case, Armde with his title, and a subiects zeale, Takes vp iust armes against the house of Yorke: And do proclaime our auncient libertie: all Libertie, libertie, libertie, generall libertie, Fal. We do not rise like Tiler, Cade, and Straw, Blewbeard, and other of that rascall route, Basely like Tinkers, or such muddie slaues, For mending measures, or the price of corne, Or for some common in the wilde of Kent, Thats by some greedy Cormorant inclosde, But in the true and ancient lawfull right, Of the redoubted house of Lancaster. Our bloud is noble, by our birth a Neuill, And by our lawfull line Lord Falconbridge, Whose heere thats of so dull a leaden temper, That is not fired with a Neuils name? All. A Neuill, a Neuill, a Neuill, Fa. Our quarrell like our selfe is honorable, The law our warrant. Smoke I, I, the law is on our side. Chub. I, the law is in our owne handes. Spicing. Peace you Rogues. Fa. And more, a blessing by the word proposde, To those that aide a true annointed king, Corage braue spirits and crie a Falconbridge, All. A Falconbridge, a Falconbridge, Fal. We will be maisters of the mint our selues, And set our own stampe on the golden coyne: Weele shooe our neighing Coursers with no worse, Then the purest siluer that is sold in Cheape. At Leaden hall weele sell pearles by the pecke, As now the mealemen vse to sell their meale: In Westminster weele keepe a solemne Courte, And build it bigger to receiue our men, Crie Falconbridge my harts liberty, All. Falconbridge and liberty &amp;c. Smoke. Peace ye slaues, or I will smoke ye else, Chub. Peace ye slaues, or I will chub your chappes, but indeed thou maiest well smoke them, because thy name is Smoke. Smoke. Why Sirra, I hope Smoke the Smith of Chepsted, is as good a man as Chub the Chandler of Sandwich. Spicing. Peace ye Rogues, what are you quarrilling? and now list to Captaine Spicing. You know Cheapeside there are the Mercers shops, Where we will measure veluet by our pikes: And Silkes and Sattens by the streetes whole bredth: Weele take the Tankardes from the Conduit cockes, To fill with Ipocras and drinke carowse. Where chaines of gold and plate shall be as plentie, As wodden dishes in the wild of Kent: Smoke. Oh brauely said Ned Spicing, the honestest Lad that euer pund spice in a morter, now speakes Captaine Smoke. Looke lads for from this hill ye may discerne, The louely towne which we are marching to, That same is London Lads ye looke vpon, Raunge all arow my heartes and stand at gaze, As doe the heardes of Deere at some strange sight: Or as a troupe of hungrie trauellers, That fix their eyes vpon a furnish'd feast, Looke how the Tower doth tise vs to come on, To take out Henry the sixt there prisoner, See how S. Katherines smokes, wipe slaues your eyes And whet your stomackes for the good mault pies. Chub. Why then belike I am no body: roome and auoidance, for now speakes Captain Chub: No sooner in London will we be, But the Bakers for you, the Brewers for me, Birchin lane shall sute vs, the Costermongers fruite vs: The Poulters send vs in Fowle, And Butchers meat without controule: And euer when we sup or dine: The Uintners freely bring vs in wine: If any body aske who shall pay, Cut off his head and send him away, This is Captaine Chubs law whosoeuer say nay. Fal. Brauely resolude, so march we forward all, And boldly say, good lucke shall vs befall. Exeunt. Enter the Lord Maior, M. Shoare, M. Iosseline, in their veluet coates, and gorgets, and leading staues. Mai. This is well done, thus should good Cittizens, Fashion themselues as well for warre as peace: Haue ye commanded that in euery streete, They hang foorth lights as soone as night comes on? Say Cosen Shoare, that was referd to you. Shoare We haue my Lord, besides from euery hall There is at least two hundred men in armes. Maior. It cheares my heart to heare this readines, Let neuer rebels put true Subiectes downe, Come when they wil, theyr welcome shal be such, As they had better kept them further off. But where is M. Recorder? his aduise, Must not be wanting in these high affaires. Sho. About an houre agoe, and somewhat more, I left him fortifying the bridge my Lord, Which done he purposed to meete you here: Mai. A discreet painefull Gentleman he is, And we must all of vs be so inclinde: If we entend to haue the Cittie safe, Or looke for thankes, and credit with the king, I tell ye maisters, aged though I be, I (for my part) will to no bed this night. Ioss. Why is it thought the Bastard is so neare? Maior. How meane ye M. Iosseline by neare? He neither comes from Italy nor Spaine: But out of Kent, and Essex which you know, Are both so neare, as nearer cannot be. Ioss. Nay, by your patience good my Lord a word, Simple though I am, yet I must confesse, A mischiefe further off, would, and so foorth, You know my meaning, thinges not seene before, Are, and so foorth, yet in good sadnes, I would that all were well, and perchance, It may be so, what, were it not for hope, The hart, and so foorth, but to the matter, You meane and purpose, I, I, am sure ye doe? M. Well M. Iosseline, we are sure ye mean wel Although somewhat defectiue in your vtterance. Io. I, I, my Lord Maior, I am you know, Willing, ready, and so foorth, tut, tut, for me, ha, ha My Mansion is at Ham, and thence you know, I come to helpe you in this needfull time: When rebels are so busie, and so foorth, What Maisters age must neuer be despisde, You shall finde me my Lord, still, and so foorth, Enter Vrswicke the Recorder. Sh. My Lord, now here comes M. Recorder. Re. Good euen my good L. Maior, the streets are chainde, The Bridge well manned &amp; euery place preparde, Shall we now goe together and consult, What else there is to be determinde of? M. Your comming M. Recorder was the thing We all desired therefore let vs consult, And now what say ye, if with halfe our power, We issue foorth, and giue the rebels fight? Recor. Before they doe prouoke vs nearer hand There were no way to that, if all be pleasde, Whats your opinion M. Iosseline? Ioss. Good sooth my L. Maior, and M. Recorder, You may take your choice, but in my conceite, Issue if you will, or else stay if you will, A man can neuer be too warie and so foorth, Yet as to issue will not be the worst, Euen so to tarrie, well, you may thinke more on t, But all is one, we shall be sure to fight, And you are wise inough, to see your time, I, I, a Gods name. Recor. My Lord accept his meaning better then his counsel. Mai. I, so we do, or else we were to blame, What if wee stoppe the passage of the Thames, With such prouision as we haue of shippes? Recor. Its doubtfull yet my Lord, whether the rebelles, Purpose that way to seeke our detriment, Rather me seemeth they will come by land, And either make assault at London bridge, Or else at Algate, both which enterances, Were good they should be strongly fortified. Ios. Well said maister Recor. you do, I I, I warrant ye. Re. As for the other, the whole companies Of Mercers, Grocers, Drapers, and the rest, Are drawne togither for their best defence, Beside the Tower, a neighbour to that place, As on the one side it will cleere the riuer, So on the other with their Ordenance, It may repulse and beate them from the gate. Mai. What noyse is this? prouide ye sodainly: A noyse within. And euerie man betake him to his charge. Enter a Messenger. Shore Soft who is this, how now my friend what news? Mes. My maister the Lieutenant of the Towre, giues ye to vnderstand, he hath descride the armie of the rebels. Recor. Which way come they? Mes. From Essexward, and therefore tis his mind, You guard both Algate well, and Bishopsgate. Mai. Saint George away, and let vs all resolue, Either to vanquish this rebellious rout, Preserue our goods, our children and our wiues, Or seale our resolution with our liues. Exeunt. Enter Falconbridge, Spicing, with his troups. Fal. Summon the Cittie, and commaund our entrance, Which if we shall be stubburnly denide, Our power shall rush like thunder through the walles, Spi. Open your gates slaues when I c?mand ye, Spicing beates on the gates, and then enters the L. Maior and his associates with prentises. M. Whats he that beates thus at the Cittie gates, Commanding entrance as he were a king? Fa. He that will haue releasment for a king: I Thomas Neuell the Lord Falconbridge. Sp. Ho Sirra, you, claperdudgen, vnlock, vnbolt, Or Ile bolt you if I get in, stand you preaching with a pox? M. We haue no warrant Tho. Falconbridge, To let your armed troupes into our Cittie, Considering you haue taken vp these armes, Against our soueraigne and our countries peace. Fa. I tell the Maior, and know he tels thee so, That commeth armed in a kings defence, That I craue entrance in Kings Henries name, In right of the true line of Lankaster, Me thinks that word spoke from a Neuils mouth Should like an earthquake rend your chained gates, And teare in peeces your portcullises, I thunder it againe into your eares, You stout and braue couragious Londoners, In Henries name I craue my entrance in, R. Should Henries name c?mand thee entrance here, We should denie aleageance vnto Edward, Whose true and faithfull subiects we are sworne, And in whose presence is our sword vp borne. Fa. I tell thee traitor then thou bearst thy sword Against thy true vndoubted king, S ho. Nay then I tell thee bastard Falconbridge, My Lord Maior beares his sword in his defence, That put the sword into the armes of London, Made the Lord Maiors for euer after knights, Richard, deposde by Henrie Bullingbrooke, From whom the house of Yorke doth claime their right. Fa. Whats he that answeres vs thus saucily? Smo. Sirra your name, that we may know ye hereafter, Sho. My name is Shoare, a Goldsmith by my trade, Fal. What not that Shoare that hath the daintie wife, Shoares wife, the flowre of London for her beautie. Sho. Yes rebell euen the verie same. Spy. Runne rascall and fetch thy wife to our Generall presently, or else all the Gold in Cheapside cannot ransome her: wilt thou not stirre when I bidde thee. Fa. Shoare listen me, thy wife is mine thats flatte, This night in thine owne house shee sleepes with mee, Nowe Crosebie Lord Maior shall wee enter in? Ma. Crosebie the Lord Maior tels thee proud rebell no. Fal. No Crosbie shall I not: then doating Lord, I cramme the name of rebell downe thy throate, Theres not the poorest rascall in my campe, But if hee chance to meete thee in Cheapside Upon thy footecloath, he shall make thee light, And hold his stirrop while he mount thy horse, Then lackie him which way he please to goe, Crosebie Ile make the Cittizens be gladde, To send thee and the Aldermen thy brethren, All manacled, and chainde like Gally slaues, To ransom them, and to redeeme the Cittie. M. Nay then proud rebell, pause &amp; heare me speak, Theres not the poorest and meanest Cittizen, That is a faithfull subiect to the king, But in despight of thy rebellious route, Shall walke to Bowe, a small wand in his hand, Although thou lie encamped at Mileend Greene, And not the proudest rebell of you all, Shall dare to touch him for his damned soule. Come, we will pull vp our portcullises, And let me see thee enter if thou dare, Fa. Spoken like a man, and true veluet iacket, And we will enter or sticke by the way. Exeunt. Enter Lord Maior, Recorder, and Iosseline. M. Wheres maister Recorder, and master Iosseline? Recor. Here my Lord Maior, wee nowe haue mande the walles, and fortified such places as were needfull, Mai. Why it is well, brothers and Cittizens, Sticke to your Cittie as good men should do, Thinke that in Richards time euen such a rebell, Was then by Walworth the Lord Maior of London, Stabd dead in Smithfield: Then shew your selues as it befits the time, And let this find a hundreth Walworths now, Dare stabbe a rebell were he made of brasse, And Prentises sticke to your officers, For you may come to be as we are now, God and our King against an arrant rebell, Brothers away, let vs defend our walles: 1 Pren. My Lord your words are able to infuse, A double courage in a cowards breast, Then feare not vs although our chinnes be bare, Our hearts are good, the triall shall be seene, Against these rebels on this champion greene. 2 Pren. we haue no tricks nor pollicies of warre, But by the ancient custome of our Fathers, Weele soundly lay it on, takte off that wil. And London Prentises be rulde by me, Die ere ye loose faire Londons libertie: S. How now my flatcaps, are ye grown so braue? Tis but your words, when matters come to proofe, Youle scudde as twere a companie of sheepe, My counsaile therefore is to keepe your shoppes, What lacke you, better will beseeme your mouths, Then termes of warre, in sooth you are too yong: Pr. Sirra go too, you shall not find it so, Flatcappes thou calst vs, wee scorne not the name, And shortly by the vertue of our swords, Weele make your cappe so sit vnto your crowne, As sconce and cappe and all kisse the ground. 2 P. You are those desperat idle swaggering mates, That haunt the subburbs in the time of peace, And raise vp ale-house braules in the streete, And when the rumor of the war beginnes, You hide your heades, and are not to be found, Thou termest it better that we keepe our shops, It's good indeed we should haue such a care, But yet for all our keeping now and then, Your Pelfring fingers breake into our lockes, Untill at Tyborne you acquite the fault: Go to, albeit by custome we are milde, As those that doe professe ciuility, Yet being moude a nest of angrie hornets Shall not be more offensiue then we will, Weele flie about your eares and sting your harts. Ioss. He tels you truth my frends, and so foorth. Fa. Who can endure to be so braude by boyes? 1 Pr. Nay scorne vs not that we are Prentises, The Chronicles of England can report, What memorable actions we haue done, To which this dayes atchiuement shall be knit, To make the volume larger then it is. Ma. Now of mine honor, yee do cheare my heart Braue English ofspringes, valiantly resolude, 2 Pre. My Lord returne you backe, let vs alone, You are our Maisters, giue vs leaue to worke, And if we do not vanquish them in sight, Let vs go supperles to bed at night. Exeunt all but Spicing, Smoke, and their crew. Spi. Sm. get thee vp on the top of S. Buttolphes steeple, and make a proclamation. Smoke What a plague should I proclaime there? Spi. That the bels be rung backewarde, And cutting of throates be cride hauoke, No more calling of lanthorne and candlelight, That maidenheades be valued at iust nothing: And Sacke be solde by the Sallet. That no pidling slaue stand to picke a locke, but slash me off the hinges, as one would slit vp a Cowes paunch. Spicing. Let no man haue lesse then a warehouse to his wardrope: crie a figge for a Sergeant, and walke by the Counter like a Lord, plucke out the Clapper of Bow bell, and hang vp all the Sextons in the Cittie. Smoke. Rantam Scantam, Rogues follow your Leader, Caualero Spicing the maddest slaue that ere pund spice in a morter. Spi. Take me an Usurer by the greasie pouch, and shake out his Crownes, as a hungrie dog would shake a Haggas, Barre foule play Rogues, and liue by honest filching and stealing, he that hath a true finger, let him forfaite his face to the fryingpan. Follow your Leader Rogues, follow your Leader. Smoke. Assault, Assault, and crie a Falconbridge. Iosseline on the walles cries to them. Ioss. Sirra Spicing, if Spicing bee thy name, wee are here for matters and causes as it might seeme for the king, therefore it were good, and so foorth. Spi. Open the gates, or if we be the Picklockes, ye Rogues weele play the Mastiffe dogs amongst you: If I wory not a thousand of you wth my teeth, let mee bee hangde in a packethreed, and so foorth. Ioss. Fond fellow, iustice is to be vsed I marie is it, and law in some sort as it were is to be followed, oh God forbid else, this our Magistrate hath power as it might seeme, and so foorth, for dutie is to be obserued, &amp; Officers must be obeyed, in sort and calling, and so foorth. Spi. Weele talke more anone, good M. and so foorth. Here is a very fierce assault on all sides, wherein the Prentises do great seruice. Enter Falconbridge angrie with his men. Fal. Why this it is to trust to these base Rogues. This durty scum of rascall pesantrie: This hartles rout of base rascalitie, A plague vpon you all, you cowardly Rogues; You crauand Curres, you slimy muddy clownes, Whose courage but consistes in multitude, Like sheepe and neat that follow one an other, Which if one runne away, all follow after: This hedge-bred Rascall, this filthy frie of ditches, A vengeance take you all, this t'is to leade you, Now doe you crie and shrike at euery shocke, A hot consuming mischiefe follow you. Spi. Swoundes scale Rogues, scale, a Falconbridge, a Falconbridge. Enter Lord Maior and his traine. Ma. Set open the gates, nay then weell sally out, It neuer shall be said when I was Maior, The Londoners were shut vp in the Cittie, Then crie king Edward, and lets issue out. Fal. Now if you be true hearted Englishmen, The Gat'es set open and the portcullise vp: Lets Pell Mell in, to stop their passage out, He that first enters, be possest of Cheape, I giue it him freely, and the chiefest wench. Spi. That he can finde, let that lie in the bargaine. Exeunt The Lord Maior and the Cittizens hauing valiantly repulsed the Rebels from the Cittie: Enters Falconbridge and Spicing and their traine wounded and dismaied. Spi. Hear'st thou Generall, theres hote drinking at the Mouth at Bishopsgate, for our souldiers are all Mouth, they lie like Rascals with their Braines beaten out, therefore since we are all like to feed hogges in Houndsditch, let vs retire our troups, and saue our maimed men, or if we issue further, we are put to the sword euery mothers sonne of vs. Fal. Art thou that villaine in whose damned mouth, Was neuer heard of any word but woundes? Whose recreant limbes are nocht with gaping scarres, Thicker then any carking craft-mans skore, Whose very skalpe is scratcht and crasde and broken, Like an old mazzer beaten on the stones, And standst thou now to saue our maimed men? A plague vppon thee coward. Spi. Why how now base Thomas? Swoundes, wert thou a base Uiall, thou art but a rascall and a rebel as I am, hearst thou, if I do not turne true Subiect and leaue thee, let me be wurried with dogs, Swoundes dost thou impeach my manhood? Tom Neuill thou hadst as good to haue damd thy selfe as vtterd such a word, flatly I forsake thee, and all y t loue Ned Spicing follow me. Here the rest offer to follow him. Fal. Come come yee teastie foole, thou seest me greeude, Yet canst not beare with mine infirmity, Thou knowest I holde thee for as tall a man As any liues or breathes our English aire, I know there liues not a more fierie spirite, A more resolued valiant, a plague vpon it, Thou knowest I loue thee, yet if a word escape My lips in anger, how teastie then thou art? I had rather all men left me then thy selfe, Thou art my soule, thou art my Genius: I cannot liue without thee not an hower, Thus must I still be forc'd against my will, aside, To sooth this durty slaue, this cowardly rascall. Come, come be friendes, ye teastie firebrand, We must retire there is no remedy. Spi. Nay Tom, if thou wilt haue me mount on the walles And cast my selfe downe headlong on their pikes, Ile do it, but to impeach my valour, Had any man but thou spoke halfe so much, I would haue split his heart, still beware My valour, such words go hardly downe, Wel, I am friends, thou thoughtest not as thou spakest Fal. No on my soule, thou thinkst not that I did, Sound a retrait there I command ye straite, But whither shall wee retire? Spi. To Mileend Greene, theres no fitter place, Fal. Then let vs back retire to Mileend Greene, And there expect fresh succour from our friendes, With such supply as shall ere long assure The Citie is our own, march on, away. Exeunt. Enter the L. Maior with his train and prentises. Maior Ye haue bestird yee like good Cittizens, And shewne your selues true subiects to your king, You worthily prentises bestirde your selues, That it did cheere my heart to see your valour, The rebels are retirde to Mileende Greene. Re. Where so we may not suffer them to rest. But issue forth vpon them with fresh force. Ios. My L. Maior, diligence doth wel, &amp; so forth. Matters must be looked into as they ought, indeed should they, when things are well done, they are, and so forth, for causes and things must indeede be lookt into. M. Wel sir, we very wel conceiue your meaning, And you haue shewn your self a worthy gentlem?: See that our wals be kept with courts of guard, And wel defended against the enemie, For we wil now withdraw vs to Guild hall, To take aduise what further must be don. Exeunt Enter maister Shoare and Iane his wife. Shore Be not afraid (sweete heart) the worst is past, God haue the praise, the victorie is ours, We haue preuailde, the rebels are repulsde, And euerie streete of London soundeth ioy, Canst thou then (gentle Iane) be sad alone? Iane I am not sad now you are here with me, My ioy, my hope, my comfort, and my loue, My deere, deere husband, kindest Mathew Shoare, But when these armes the circles of my soule, Were in the fight so forward as I heard, How could I choose, sweete heart, but be afraid? Sho. Why dost thou tremble now, when perils past? Ia. I thinke vpon the horror of the time, But tel me why you fought so desperately? Sho. First to maintaine King Edwards royaltie, Next to defend the Citties libertie, But cheefely Iane to keepe thee from the foyle, Of him that to my face did vow thy spoyle, Had he preuailde, where then had beene our liues, Dishonored our daughters, rauished our faire wiues, Possest our goods, and set our seruants free, Yet al this nothing to the losse of thee. Ia. Of me sweete heart? why howe should I be lost? UUere I by thousand stormes of fortune tost, And should endure the poorest wretched life, yet Iane will be thy honest loyall wife, The greatest Prince the sunne did euer see, Shall neuer make me proue vntrue to thee: Sh. I feare not faire meanes, but a rebels force, Ia. These hands shal make this bodie a dead corse, Ere force or flatterie shal mine honour staine, Sh. True fame suruiues, when death the flesh hath slaine. Enter an Officer from the Lord Maior. Of. God saue ye maister Shoare, &amp; mistris by your leaue, Sir my L. Maior sends for ye by mee, And praies your speedie presence at Guyld hall, Theres newes the rebels haue made head againe, And haue ensconcde themselues vpon Mileend, And presently our armed men must out, You being Captaine of two companies In honour of your valour and your skill, Must leade the vaward, God &amp; right stand with yee. Sh. Friend tel my Lord Ile waite vpon him strait. Ia. Friend tel my Lord he does my husband wrong, To set him formost in the daunger still, ye shall not go if I may haue my will, S. Peace wife, no more, friend I will follow ye, Exit. Ia. Ifaith ye shall not, prethee do not go. Sh. Not go sweete heart? that were a cowards trick, A traitors part to shrinke when others fight, Enuie shall neuer say that Mathew Shore The Goldsmith staid, when other men went out, To meete his Kings and countries enemie, No Iane, gainst al the rebels on Mileend, I dare alone K. Edwards right defend. Ia. If you be slaine, what shall become of mee? Sh. Right well my wench, inowe wil marrie thee, I leaue thee worth at least fiue thousand pound. Ia. Marrie again? that word my heart doth wound, Ile neuer marrie, nor I wil not liue, She weepes. If thou be kild, let me go with thee Mat. Sh. Tis idle talke good Iane, no more of that, Go to my Ladie Maioresse and the rest, As you are stil companion with the best, UUith them be merrie, and pray for our good speede, Ia. To part from thee my verie heart doth bleed. Exeunt. Enter Falconbridge with his troupes marching, as being at Mileend. Fa. Yet stand we in the sight of vprearde Troy, And sucke the aire she drawes: our verie breath Flies from our nostrils warme vnto the walles, UUe beard her bristling spires, her battled towres, And proudly stand and gaze her in the face, Looke on me, and I doubt not ye imagine, My worth as great as any one of yours, My fortunes, would I basely fawne on Edward, To be as faire as any mans in England, But he that keepes your soueraigne in the Towre, Hath seazde my land, and robd me of my right, I am a Gentleman as well as hee, What he hath got, he holdes by tyrannie, Now if you faint or cowardly should flie, There is no hope for any one to liue, We heare the Londoners will leaue the Cittie, And bidde vs battaile here on Mileend Greene, Whom if we vanquish, then we take the towne, And ride in triumph thorow Cheape to Paules, The Mint is ours, Cheap, Lumbard street our own The meanest souldier wealthier then a King. Spi. March faire ye rogues, all kings or cap-knitters: dost thou heare Tom Falconbridge? I pre thee grant me one boone I shal aske thee. Fa. What is it Ned? its hard I should denie thee. Spi. Why that when we haue wonne the Cittie, as wee cannot choose but winne it, that I may haue the knighting of all these rogues and rascalles. Fal. What then? Sp. What then? Zounds I scorne your scuruie wry mouthed, what then? now a poxe take me if I fight a blow. Fal. why this is fine, go to, knight whom thou wilt: Spi. Who, I knight any of them? Ile see them hangde first for a companie of tattred ragged rascalles, if I were a king, I would not knight one of them? Chub. What not mee Caualero Chub? Spi. Yes, I care not if I knight thee: and yet Ile see thee hangd ere ile honour thee so much: I care not so much for the matter, but I would not be denide my humour. Fal. Why what a peruerse fellow art thou Ned? Spi. Ho my fine Tom, my braue Falconbridge, my mad Greeke, my lustie Neuill: thou art a king, a Cesar, A plague on thee, I loue thee not, and yet Ile die with thee. Enter the Lord Maior, Recorder, Iosseline, Shoare, and their Souldiours marching. Maior. See how rebellion can exalte it selfe, Pruning the feathers of sicke discipline. Recor. They think they can outlook our truer looks. S. Marke but the scornefull eie of Falconbridge. M. I rather thinke tis feare vpon his cheeke, Decyphers pale disturbance in his heart. Ios. Our comming forth hath, wel, I say no more, But shall we take occasion, and so forth, Rebellion should haue no respite, oh my Lord, The time hath beene, but all is one for that. Spi. How like a troupe of rank ore ridden Iades, You bushie bearded Cittizens appeare? Chub. Nay, rather so many men in the Moone, And euerie one a furzen bush in his mouth. Spi. The foure &amp; twentie wards? now faire befal them, UUould any one haue thought before this houre, There had beene such increase of muddie slaues? Spi. Peace souldiours, they are resolute you see, And not to flatter vs, nor fauour them, Such haughtie stomacks seldome haue been seene, Imbodyed in the breasts of Cittizens, How sternely in their owne peculiar strength, UUithout the assistance of their lingering king, Did they of late repulse vs from their walles? And now againe how expeditiously, And vnexpected they haue met vs here? were we more deadly incensed then we are, I would not but commend their chiualrie. Spi. Captaine, shal we go challenge them to fight? Sbloud we burne daylight, theile thinke anon, we are afraid to see their glittering swords. Ch. Tell them they come in steed of pudding pies, And Stratford cakes to makes a banquet here. Fal. Soft giue me leaue, I wil deuise with words, To weaken and abash their fortitude, Re. The Bastard offers to come forth my Lord. Ma. I am the man intend to answere him. Fa. Crosbie. Ma. Traytor. all Traitour? zounds downe with him. Fa. Be patient, giue me leaue I say to speake, I doubt not but the traitors name shall rest With those that keeps their lawful K. in bondes: Meane time ye men of London once againe, Behold my warlike colours are displaide, which I haue vowd shall neuer be wrapt vp, Untill your loftie buildings kisse our feet, Unlesse you grant me passage throgh your streets. Re. Passage, sayst thou? that must be ore our breasts, If any passage thou art like to haue. Fa. Why then vpon your bodies will I tread, And wade through standing pooles of your lost bloud. Sh. We know thy threats, and recken them as wind, Not of sufficient powre to shake a reede. Spi. But we shooke your gates not long agoe, And made your walles to shake like yrish bogges. Chub. I, and so terrified ye, that not one of ye durst come to fetch a pinte of sacke at the mouth at Bishopsgate, no not for your liues. Ios. I but you know what followed, and so forth. Spi. Et cetera? are you there? mee thinks the sight of the dun Bull, the Neuels honord crest, should make you leaue your broken sentences, and quite forgette euer to speake at a l. Sho. Nay then looke thou vpon our Citties armes, Wherein is a bloudie dagger, that is it, Wherewith a rebell like to Falconbridge, Had his desert, meete for his trecherie, Can you behold that, and not quake for feare? Re. Since when, it is successiuely decreed, Traitours with vs shal neuer better speede. Sp. Captaine and fellow souldiours talke no more, But draw your meaning forth in down right blowes. Falcon. Sound then alarum. Maior, Do the like for vs, and where the right is, there attend successe. Ios. Stay and be better aduisde, why countrimen, What is this Falconbridge you follow so? I could instruct you, but you know my mind. And Falconbridge what are these rusticalles, Thou shouldst repose such confidence in glasse, Shall I informe thee? no, thou art wise inough, Edward of Yorke delaies the time you say, Therefore hee will not come, imagine so, The Citties weake, hold that opinion stil, And your pretence king Henries libertie. True, but as how? shall I declare you? no. what then? youle fight, a gods name take your choise, I can no more but giue you mine aduise. Fal. Away with this parenthises of words, Crosbie courage thy men, and on this greene, whose cause is right, let it be quickly seene. Maior I am as readie as thou canst desire, On then a Gods name. They fight, the rebels driue them backe: then enter Falconbridge and Spicing. Fa. This was well fought, now Spicing list to me, The Cittizens thus hauing giuen vs ground, And therefore somewhat daunted, take a band Of Essex souldiours, and with all the speede Thou possibly canst make, withdraw thy selfe, And get betweene the Cittie gates and them. Spi. Oh braue Tom Neuill, gallant Falconbridge, I ayme at thy intended pollicie, This is thy meaning, while thou art imployde, And holdst them battaile here on Mileend Greene, I must prouide as harbenger before, There be not onely cleere and open passage, But the best marchants houses to receiue Us and our retinew, I am proud of that, And will not sleepe vpon thy iust command. Fal. Away then I will follow as I may, And doubt not but that ours will be the day. After some excursions, enter Lord Maior and maister Shoare. Ma. We haue recouered what before we lost, And heauen stands with the iustice of our cause, But this I noted in the fight euen now, That part of this rebellious crewe is sent, By what direction, or for what intent, I cannot ghesse, but may suspect the worst, And as it seemes, they compasse it about, To hemme vs in, or get the gate of vs, And therefore Cosin Shoare, as I repose Trust in thy valour and thy loyaltie, Draw forth three hundred bowmen, &amp; some pikes. And presently encounter their assault. Shoare. I haue your meaning, and effect my Lord, I trust shall dissappoynt them of their hope. After an alarum, Enter Spicing with drum and certaine Souldiours. Spi. Come on my harts, we wil be kings to night, Carowse in Gold, and sleep with marchants wiues, While their poore husbands loose their liues abroad, We are now quite behind our enemies backs, And theres no let or hindrance in the way, But we may take possession of the towne, Ah you mad rogues, this is the wished houre, Follow your leader, and be resolute. As he marcheth, thinking to enter, Shoare and his souldiers issue foorth and repulse him, after excursions, wherein the rebels are disperst. Enter Maior, Recor. Shoare, Iosseline, and a Messenger talking with the Maior. Maior. I, my good frend, so certifie his grace, The Rebels are dispersed all and fled, And now his Highnes meetes with victorie. Exit Mess. Marshall your selues, and keepe in good aray: To adde more glorie to this victory: The king in person commeth to this place, How great an honor haue you gainde to day? And how much is this Cittie famde for euer, That twise without the helpe, eyther of king, Or any, but of God, and our owne selues, We haue preuailde against our countries foes? Thankes to his maiestie assisted vs, Who alwaies helps true Subiectes in their need. The Trumpets sound, then enters king Edward, L. How. Sellinger and the traine, King. Where is my Lord Maior? Maior. Here dread Soueraigne. I hold no Lordship nor no dignitie, In presence of my gratious Lord the king, But all I humble at your highnes feet, With the most happie conquest of proud rebels, Dispearst and fled, that now remaines no doubt, Of euer making head to vex vs more. K. You haue not tane the bastard Falconbridge: Or is he slaine? M. Neither my gratious Lord. Although we labourd to our vttermost, Yet all our care came ouer short, For apprehending him or Spicing eyther, But some are taken, others on proffered grace, Yeelded themselues, and at your mercy stand. K. Thanks good L. Maior, you may condemn vs Of too much slacknes in such vrgent need: But we assure you on our royall word, So soone as we had gathered vs a power, We dallied not, but made all haste we could, What order haue ye tane for Falconbridge, And his confederates in this rebellion? Maior. Under your leaue my Liedge, we haue proclaimd Who bringeth Falconbridge aliue or dead, Shall be requited with a thousand markes, As much for Spicing, others of lesse worth At easier rates are set. K. Well haue ye done, And wee will see it paid from our Exchequer. Now leaue we this and come to you, That haue so well deserude in these affaires, Affaires, I meane of so maine consequence. Kneele downe and all of you receiue in field, The honor you haue merited in field. There he drawes his sword and knightes them. Arise Sir Iohn Crosbie, L. Maior of London and knight. Arise vp Sir Ralph Iosseline knight. Arise Sir Thomas Vrswicke our Recorder of London, and knight. Now tell me which is M. Shoare. Ma. This same my Lord, And hand to hand he fought with Falconbridge. King. Shoare kneele thou downe. What call yee else his name? Recor. His name is Mathew Shoare my Lord. K. Shoare, why kneelest thou not, and at thy Soueraignes hand receiue thy right? Shoare. Pardon me gratious Lord, I do not stand contemptuous or despising, Such royall fauour of my Soueraigne, But to acknowledge mine vnworthines: Far be it from the thought of Mathew Shoare, That he should be aduanc'de with Aldermen, With our L. Maior, &amp; our right graue Recorder. If any thing hath beene performde by me, That may deserue your Highnes mean'st respect, I haue inough, and I desire no more, Then let me craue that I may haue no more. King. Well, be it as thou wilt, some other way We will deuise to quittance thy desertes, And not to faile therein vpon my word. Now let me tell ye all my frendes at once, Your king is married, since you saw him last, And haste, to helpe you in this needfull time, Made me on sudden to forsake my bride. But seeing all thinges are fallen out so well, And there remaines no further doubt of ill, Let me entreate you would goe boote your selues, And bring your king a little on his way. How say you my Lord, shal it be so? M. Now God forbid but that my Lord the king Should alwaies haue his Subiectes at command. Ioss. Forbid quotha? I in good sadnes, your maiestie shall finde vs alwaies readie, and so foorth. King. Why then set forward Gentlemen, And come L. Maior, I must conferre with you. Exeunt Enter Falconbridge and Spicing with their weapons in their handes. Spi. Art thou the man whose victories drawn at sea, Fild euery heart with terror of thy name? Art thou that Neuill whome we tooke thee for? Thou art a lowse, thou bastard Falconbridge? Thou baser then a bastard, in whose birth The very dregges of seruitude appeares, Why tel me, liuer of some rotten sheepe, After by thy allurements we are brought, To vndertake this course, after thy promises Of many golden mountaines to ensue, Is this the greatest comfort thou canst giue? Hast thou insnarde our heedles feet with death, And brought vs to the Iibbet of defame, And now dost bid vs shift and saue our selues? No crauen were I sure I should be tane, I would not stirre my feet, vntill this hand Had venged me on thee for misguiding vs. Fal. Opprobrious villaine, stable excrement, That neuer dreamst of other manhood yet, But how to ierke a horse, vntill my wordes Infusde into thee resolutions fire. Controlst thou me for that wherein thy selfe, Art onely the occasion of mishap? Hadst thou and they stoode to it aswell as I, The day had beene our owne, and London now, That laughes in triumph, should haue wept in teares But being backt by such faint harted slaues No maruaile if the Lyon go to wracke, As though it were not incident to kinges, Somet me to take repulse, mine is no more: Nor is not for that muddy braine of thine To tutor me how to disgest my losse, Then flie with those that are alreadie fled, Or stay behinde, and hang all but the head. Spi. Oh preiudice to Spicinges conquering name, Whose valour eu? the hacks this sword has made Upon the flint, and iron barres at Aldgate: Like mouthes wil publish whiles the Citty stands That I shrunke backe? that I was neuer seene To shew my manly spleene, but with a whip? I tell thee Falconbridge the least of these, Do challenge bloud before they be appeasde, Fal. Away ye scoundrell, tempt not my resolue, The courage that suruiues in Falconbridge, Scornes the incounter of so base a drudge. Spi. By the pure temper of this sword of mine, By this true flesh and bloud that gripes the same, And by the honour I did winne of late, Against those frostie bearded Cittizens, It shall be tride before we do depart, Whether accuseth other wrongfully, Or which of vs two is the better man. Fal. I shall but quit the Hangman of a labour, Yet rather then to be vpbraided thus, The Eagle once will stoope to feede on carrion. They fight, enter Chub. Ch. Hold if ye be men, if not, hold as ye are: rebels &amp; strong theeues: I bring you newes of a proclamation, the King hath promised that whosoeuer can bring the head of Falconbridge, or Spicing, shall haue for his labour a thousande crownes, what meane you then to swagger? saue your selues. Spi. This proclamations come in happie time, Ile vanquish Falconbridge, and with this sword, Cutte off his head, and beare it to the king, So not alone shall I be pardoned, But haue the thousand crownes is promised. Fal. This rascall was ordainde to saue my life, For now when I haue ouerthrowne the wretch, Euen with his head Ile yeeld me to the king, His princely word is past to pardon mee, And though I were the cheefe in this rebellion, Yet this will be a meanes to make my peace. Chub. Oh that I knew how to betray them both. Fal. How sayst thou Spi. wilt thou yeeld thy selfe? For I haue vowde either aliue or dead To bring thee to King Edward? Sp. And I haue vowde the like by thee. How will these two bad contraryes agree? Chub. And I the same by both of you. Fal. Come sir, ile quickly rid you of that care. Spi. And what thou lottest me, shall be my share. Chub. Here comes a miller, helpe to part the fray, These are the rebelles Falconbridge and Spicing, The worst of them is worth a thousand crownes. Mill. Marrie and such a bootie would I haue, Submit, submit, it is in vaine to striue, exit. Fal. Spi. Why what art thou? Mill. One that wil hamper you, But whats the other that is fledde away? Chub. Oh miller, that was Falconbridge, And this is Spicing his companion. Spi. I tell thee Miller thou hast been the means, To hinder the most charitable deede, That euer honest Christian vndertooke. Chub. thou canst beare me witnesse I had tane That most notorious rebell but for him, M. But I haue taken thee, and the world knows, That Spicing is as badde as who is best. Spi. Why thou mistakst, I am a true subiect. Chub. Miller hee lies, be sure to hold him fast. Spicing. Dost thou accuse me? apprehend him too, For hees as guiltie as any of vs. Miller. Come you shall both togither answere it, Before my Lord Maior, and here hee comes. Enter Lord Maior, Iosseline, and other attendants. Ma. Sir Ralph Iosseline, haue you euer seene a Prince more affable then Edward is? what merrie talke he had vpon the way. Ios. Dubtlesse my Lord heele proue a royall King, But how now what are these? Miller. God saue your honour, Here I present vnto you my lord Maior, A paire of rebelles, whom I did espie As I was busie grinding at my mill, And taking them for vagrant idle knaues, That had beset some trueman from his house, I came to keepe the peace, but afterward, Found that it was the bastard Falconbridge, And this his mate together by the eares, The one, for al that I could doo, escapte, The other standeth at your mercie here. Maior. It is the rebell Spicing. Spicing. It is indeed? I see you are not blind you know mee then. Mai. Well miller, thou hast done a subiects part, And worthily deserust that recompence Is publikely proclaimed by the King, But whats this other? I haue seene his face, And as I take it, he is one of them. Mil. I must confesse, I took them both togither, Hee ayded me to apprehend the rest. Chub. A telles you true my Lord, I am Chub the Chaundler, and I curse the time that euer I saw their faces, for if they had not beene, I had liude an honest man in mine owne countrie, and neuer come to this. Sp. Out rogue, dost thou recant for feare of death? I Maior, I am he that sought to cut your throate, And since I haue miscarried in the fact, Ile nere denie it, do the worst you can. Ma. Bring him away, he shal haue martial law, and at the next tree we do come vnto, be hangde to rid the world of such a wretch, Miller thy dutie is a thousand marks, which must be sharde betwixt thee and this poore fellow, that did reueale him. And Sirra, your life is saude, on this condition, that you hang vp Spicing, how sayst thou, wilt thou do it? Chub. Will I doo it? what a question is that? I would hang him if he were my Father, to saue mine owne life. Maior. Then when yee haue done it, come home to my house, and there ye truely shall haue your reward. Spi. Well sirra, then thou must be my hangman? Chub. I by my troth sir, for fault of a better. Spi. Well, commend me to little Pim, and pray her to redeeme my pande hose, they lie at the blew Bore for eleuen pence, and if my hostesse will haue the other odde penie, tell her she is a damned bawde, and there is no truth in her score. Chub. Take no thought sir for your pande hose, they are lousie, and not worth the redeeming. Spi. There is a Constable sticks in my mind, hee got my sword from me, that night I should haue killed black Ralph, if I had liude, I would haue beene meete with him. Chub. I sir, but heres a thing shall take an order for that. Spi. Commend me to blacke Luce, bounsing Besse, and lustie Kate, &amp; al the other pretie morsels of mans flesh. Farewell Pinke and Pinnesse, Fliboate, and Caruell, Turnbull, and Spittle, I die like a man. Chub. Oh Captaine Spicing, thy vaine inticing, brought mee from my trade, From good candles making, to this paines taking, a rebell to be made, Therefore Ned Spicing, to quit thy enticing, this must be thy hope, By one of thy fellowes, to be led to the Gallowes, to end in a rope. Exeunt Enter Hobs the Tanner of Tamworth. Hobs. Dudgeon, dost thou heare, look wel to Brocke my mare, driue Dunne and her faire and softly downe the hill, and take heede the thornes teare not the hornes of my Cowe hides, as thou goest neere the hedges: ha, what saist thou knaue? is the Bulles hide downe? why lay it vp again, what care I? Ile meete thee at the stile, and help to set all straight, And yet God helpe, its a crooked world, and an vnthriftie, for some that haue nere a shoe, had rather go barefoote, then by clout-leather to mend the old, when they can buy no new, for they haue time inough to mend al, they sit so long between the cuppe and the wall, well God amend them, God amende them. Lette me see by my executor here, my leather pouch, what I haue taken, what I haue spent, what I haue gained, what I haue lost, and what I haue laide out: my taking is more then my spending, for heres store left. I haue spent but a groate, a pennie for my two Iades, a pennie to the poore, a pennie pot of ale, and a pennie cake for my man and me, A dicker of Cowhides cost mee Here enter the Queene and Duchesse with their riding roddes, vnpinning their masks, Hobs goes forward. Snailes who comes here? mistris Ferries, or mistris what call ye her? Put vppe Iohn Hobs, money tempts beautie. Du. Well met good fellow, sawst thou not the hart? Ho. My heart? God blesse me from seeing my heart. Du. Thy heart? the deere man, we demaund the deere. Hobs.

Camst thou not downe the woodde? Hobs Yes mistris that I did. Duch. And sawst thou not the deere imbost. Hobs. By my hood ye make me laugh, what the dickens is it loue that makes ye prate to me so fondly, by my fathers soule I would I had iobd faces with you. Huntsm. Why how now Hobs, so saucie with the Duchesse and the Queene? Hobs. much Queene I trow, these be but women, and one of them is like my wench, I would she had her ragges, I would giue a loade of heare and hornes, and a fat of leather, to match her to some Iustice, by the meg hollie. 2 Hunts. Be silent Tanner, and aske pardon of the Queen, Hobs. And ye bee the Queene, I crie ye mercie good mistris Queene. Q. No fault my friend, Madam lets take our bowes, And in the standing seeke to get a shoote. Du. Come bend our bowes, and bring the herd of deere. Exeunt. Hobs. God send yee good standing, and good striking, and fat flesh, see if all Gentlewomen be not alike when theyr blacke faces be on, I took the Queene, as I am true Tanner, for mistris Ferris. Enter Sellenger and Howard in Greene. Hobs. Soft, who comes here, more knaues yet? Sel. Ho, good fellow, sawst thou not the King? Hobs. No good fellow, I saw no king, which king doost thou aske for. How. Why King Edward, what king is there else? Hob. Theres another King and ye could hit on him, one Harrie, one Harrie, and by our Ladie they say, hees the honester man of the two. Sellen. Sirra beware you speake not treason. Hobs. What if I do? Sellen. Then thoult be hangde. Hobs. A dogges death, ile not meddle with it, for by my troth I know not when I speake treason, when I do not, theres such halting betwixt two kings, that a man cannot go vpright, but he shall offend tone of them, I would God had them both for me. How. Well, thou sawst not the king? Hobs. No, is he in the countrie? How. Hees Hunting here at Drayton Basset. Hobs. The deuill he is, God blesse his mastership: I sawe a woman here that they said was the Queene, shees as like my daughter, but my daughter is the fairer, as euer I see. Sel. Farewell fellow, speake well of the King, Exeunt. Hobs. God make him an honest man, I hope thats well spoken, for byth mouse foote, some giue him hard woords, whether he zerues vm or not, let him looke to that, Ile meddle of my cow hide, and let the world slide. Enter the king disguisde. The Diuell in a dung cart, howe these roysters swarme in the Countrie now the King is so neere? God liuer me from this, for this lookes like a theefe, but a man cannot tell amongst these Courtnoles whoes true. K. Ed. Holla my friend, good fellow pre thee stay, Hob. No such matter, I haue more haste of my way. K. Ed. If thou be a good fellow, let me borrow a word. Hobs. My purse thou meanest, I am no good fellow, and I pray God thou beest not one. K. Edward. Why? dost thou not loue a good fellow? Hobs. No, good fellowes bee theeues. K. Edw. Dost thou thinke I am one? Hobs. Thought is free, and thou art not my ghostly father. K. Ed. I meane thee no harme.

Why for King Edward, knowst thou any more Kings then one? Hobs. I know not so many, for I tell thee I know none, marie I heare of King Edward. K. Ed. Didst thou see his Highnesse? Hobs. By my hollidame, thats the best tearme thou gaust him yet, hees high inough, but hee has put poore King Harrie low inough. K. Ed. How low hath he put him? Nay, I cannot tell, but he has put him downe, for hee has got the crowne, much good doot him with it. K. Ed. Amen, I like thy talke so well, I would I knew thy name. Hobs. Dost thou not know mee? K. Ed. No. Hobs. Then thou knowst no bodie: didst neuer heare of Iohn Hobs the Tanner of Tamworth. K. Ed. Not till now I promise thee, but now I like thee well. Hobs. So do not I thee, I feare thou art some out-rider, that liues by taking of purses here on Bassets heath, but I feare thee not, for I haue wared all my money in Cowhides, at Colesil market, and my man and my mare are hard by at the hill foote. Ki. Ed. Is that thy Grey mare thats tide at the stile with the hides on her backe. Hobs. Thats Brocke my mare, and theres dunne my nag, and Dudgeon my man. K. Ed.

Enter King Edward againe, and Hobs. K. Ed. How saist thou Tanner, wilt thou take my courser for thy mare? Hobs. Courser callst thou him? so ill mought I fare, thy skittish Iade will neuer abide, to carrie my lether, my hornes nor hide. K. Ed. But if I were so mad to scorse, what boote wouldst thou giue mee? Hobs. Nay boote, thats boote woorthie, I looke for boot of thee. Hob. Ha, ha, a merrie Iigge, why man, Brocke my mare knowes ha and Ree, and will stand when I crie ho, and let me get vp and downe, and make water when I doe. Ed. Ile giue thee a Noble if I like her pace, lay thy Cowhydes in my saddle, and lets iog towardes Drayton. Hob. Ti's out of my way, but I begin to like thee well. Ed. Thou wilt like me better before wee doe parte, I pray thee tell mee, what say they of the king? Hob. Of the kinges thou mean'st, art thou no blab if I tel thee? Ed. If the king know't not now, hee shall neuer know it for mee. Hob. Masse they say king Harrie's a very aduowtrie man. King. A deuout man, and whats king Edward? Hobs. Hees a Franke Franion, a merie companion and loues a wench well, they say he has married a poore widdow because shees faire. King. Dost thou like him the worse for that? Hob. No by my Feckens, but the better, for though I bee a plaine Tanner, I loue a faire lasse my selfe. King. Pree thee tel mee, how loue they king Edward? Hob. Faith as poore folkes loue hollidaies, glad to haue them now and then, but to haue them come too often, will vndoo them, so to see the king now and then ti's comfort, but euerie day would begger vs, and I may to thee, we fear wee shalbe troubled to lend him money, for wee doubt hees but needy. King. Wouldst thou lend him no money if he should neede? Hob. By my hallydome yes, he shall haue halfe my store, and ile sell sole leather to helpe him to more. King. Faith whether louest thou better Harrie or Edward. Hob. Nay, thats counsell, and two may keepe it, if one be away. King. Shall I say my conscience? I think Harrie is the true king. Hob. Art aduisde of that? Harrie's of the old house of Lancaster, and that progenitie do I loue. K And thou dost not hate the house of Yorke? H. Why no, for I am iust a kin to Sutton Wind-mill, I can grinde which way so ere the wind blow, if it bee Harrie I can say well fare Lancaster, if it bee Edward I can sing Yorke, Yorke for my money. King. Thou art of my mind, but I say Harrie is the lawfull king, Edward is but an vsurper, and a foole and a Coward. H. Nay there thou lyest, he has wit inough, and courage inough, dost thou not speake treason? King. I, but I know to whome I speake it. H. Dost thou? well if I were Constable, I should be forsworne if I set thee not in the stockes for it. K. Well let it goe no further, for I did serue king Harrie and I loue him best, though now I serue king Edward. H. Thou art the arranter knaue to speake ill of thy maister, but sirra whats thy name, what office hast thou? and what will the king doe for thee? K. My name is Ned, I am the kinges Butler, and he wil do more for me, then for any Noble man in the Court. Hob. The Diuell hee will, hees the more foole, and so ile tell him, if ere I see him, and I wuld I might see him in my poore house at Tamwoorth. K. Goe with me to the Court and ile bring thee to the king and what sute so ere thou haue to him, ile warrant thee to speede. H. I ha nothing to do at Court, ile home with my Cowhides, and if the king will come to me he shall be welcome. K. Haste thou no sute touching thy trade, to transport hydes or sell leather onely in a certaine circuite, or about Barke, or such like, to haue Letters pattents? H. By the Masse and the Mattens I like not those Pattens, sirra they that haue them, do as the Priestes did in olde time, buy and sell the sinnes of the people, so they make the king belieue they mend whats amisse, and for money they make the thing worse then it is, theres another thing int too, the more is the pitie? K. What pittie Iohn Hobs? I pree thee say all. H. Faith ti's pittie that one subiect should haue in his hand that might do good to many through the land. K. Saiest thou me so Tanner? well lets cast lots whether thou shalt goe with me to Draiton, or I goe home with thee to Tamwoorth. H. Lot me no lotting, ile not goe with thee, if thou wilt go with me, cause thart my Lieges man (and yet I thinke hee has many honester) thou shalt bee welcome to Iohn Hobs, thou shalt bee welcome to biefe and bacon, and perhappes a bagpudding, and my daughter Nell shall pop a possel vpon thee when thou gost to bed. K. Heres my hand, ile but goe and see the king seru'de, and and ile be at home as soone as thy selfe. H. Dost thou here me Ned? if I shalbe thy host, Make haste thou art best for feare thou kisse the Post. K. Farewell Iohn Hobs, the honest true Tanner I see plaine men by obseruation, Of thinges that alter in the chaunge of times, Do gather knowledge, and the meanest life, Proportiond with content sufficiencie, Is merier then the mighty state of kings. Enters How and Selling. How now? what newes bring ye sirs, Wheres the Queene? Sel. Her Highnes and your mother my dread Lord, Are both inuited by Sir Humphrey Bowes, Where they entend to feast and lodge this night, And do expect your Graces presence there. K.

Well, God be with good King Henrie, faith the Commons will take it as a common thing, deaths an honest man, for he spares not the king: for as one comes, anothers tane away, and seldome comes the better, thats all wee say. Sellenger. Shrewdly spoken Tanner by my fay. Hobs. Come fill me a cuppe of mother Whetstones ale, I may drinke to my friendes, and driue downe my tale. Here Ned and Tom I drinke to ye: and yet if I come to the court, I doubt youle not know mee. King. Yes, Tom shal be my suretie Tanner, I wil know thee. Sel. If thou doost not Ned, by my troth I beshrewe thee. King. I drinke to my wife that may be. Sellen. Faith Ned thou maist liue to make her a Ladie. King. Tush, her father offers nothing, hauing no more children but her. Hobs. I would I had not, condicion shee had all. But I haue a knaue to my son, I remember him by you, euen such an vnthrift as one of you two, that spends all on gay clothes and new fashions, and no worke will downe with him, that I feare heele be hangde, God blesse you from a better fortune, yet you weare such filthie breekes, Lord, were not this a good fashion? yes, and would saue many a faire penie. King. Let that passe, and let vs heare your song. Hobs. Agreede, agreede, come, sol, sol, sol, fa, fa, fa, say Dudgeon. Here they Sing the threemans Song. Agencourt, Agencourt, know ye not Agencourt, Where the English slew and hurt, all the French foemen: With our Gunnes and billes browne, O the French were beaten downe, Morrys pikes and bowmen, &amp;c. Sellenger. Well sung good fellowes, I would the King heard yee. Hobs. So would I faith, I would straine a noate for him: Come take away, and lets to bedde, yee shall haue cleane sheetes Ned, but they bee course, good strong hempe, of my daughters owne spinning, and I tell thee, your Chamber pot must bee a faire horne, a badge of our occupation, for we buy no bending peauter, nor bending earth. King. No matter Hobs, wee will not goe to bedde. Hobs. What then? King. Euen what thou wilt, for it is neere day. Tanner Gramercies for our heartie cheere, If ere it be thy chance to come to court, Enquire for mee Ned the kings Butler, Or Tom of the kings chamber my companion, And see what welcome wee will giue thee there. Hobs. I haue heard of courtiers haue sayd as much as you, and when they haue beene tride, would not bidde their friends drinke. Sel. We are none such, let our horses bee brought out, For wee must away, and so with thankes farewell. Hobs. Farewell to ye both, commend me to the king, and tell him I would haue beene glad to haue seene his worship heere. exit. King. Come Tom for London, horse, and hence away. Enter the Vice-admirall and the Captaine of the Ile of Wight, with Falconbridge bound, the headsman bearing the axe before him. Mor. Thomas Neuill, yet hast thou gracious time, Of deere repentance, nowe discharge thy conscience, Lay open thine offences to the world, That wee may witnesse thou doost die a Christian. Fal. Why Sir Harrie Moorton haue you arraignde, Condemnde, and brought me to this place, Of bloudie execution, and nowe aske, If I be guiltie, therein doth appeare, What iustice you haue vsed, call you this law? Cap. Thou dost mistake our meaning Falconbridge, Wee do not aske as being ignorant, Of thy transgression, but as vrging thee, To heartie sorrow for thy vile misdeedes, That heauen may take compassion on thy soule, Fal. How charitable you would seeme to bee? I feare anon youle say it is for loue, You bind me thus, and bring me to the blocke, And that of meere affection you are mooude, To cut my head off, cunning pollicie: Such butchers as your selues do neuer want, A colour to excuse your slaughterous mindes. Mor. We butcher thee? canst thou deny thy selfe, But thou hast beene a pyrate on the sea? Canst thou denie but with the communaltie Of Kent and Essex, thou didst rise in armes, And twise assault the Cittie London, where Thou twise didst take repulse, and since that time, Canst thou denie, that being fled from thence, Thou ioynedst in confederacy with France, And camest with them to burne Southhampton here, Are these no faults thou shouldst so much presume, To cleere thy selfe, and lay thy bloud on vs? Fal. Heare me Sir Harrie, since we must dispute. Cap. Dispute vnciuil wretch, what needs dispute, Did not the Uiceadmirall heere, and I Incountring with the Nauie of the French, Attach thee in a shippe of Normandie, And wilt thou stand vpon thine innocence? Dispatch, thou art as rightfully condemnde As euer rebell was. And thou shalt die. Fal. I make no question of it, I must die, But let me tell you how I scorne your threates, So little doo I reckon of the name, Of ougly death, as were hee visible, I'lde wrastle with him for the victorie, And tugge the slaue, and teare him with my teeth, But I would make him stoope to Falconbridge, And for this life, this paltrie brittle life, This blast of winde which you haue labourde so, By iuries, sessions, and I know not what, To rob me off, is of so vile repute: That to attaine that I might liue mine age, I would not giue the value of a poynt, You cannot be so cruell to afflict, But I will be as forward to indure. Mor. Go to, leaue off these idle braues of thine: And thinke vpon thy soules health Falconbridge. Cap. Submit and aske forgiuenesse of thy King. Fal. What King? Mor. Why Edward of the house of Yorke. Fal. He is no King of mine, he does vsurpe, And if the destenies had giuen mee leaue, I would haue told him so before this time, And puld the Diademe from off his head. Mor. Thou art a traitor, stop thy traitors mouth. Fal. I am no traitor Lancaster is King, If that be treason to defende his right, What ist for them that do imprison him? If insurrection to aduaunce his scepter, What fault is theirs that step into his throane? Oh God, thou pourdst the balme vpon his head, Can that pure vnction be wipte off againe? Thou once did crowne him in his infancie, Shall wicked men now in his age depose him? Oh pardon me, if I expostulate, More then becomes a sinfull man to doo, England I feare thou wilt thy follie rue. Cap. Thou triflest time, and dost but wearie vs With dilatorie questions, make an ende, Fal. Indeede the end of all kingdomes must end, Honour and riches, all must haue an end, And he that thinks he doth the most preuaile, His head once laide, there resteth but a tale: Come fellow, do thy office, what me thinks, Thou lookest as if thy heart were in thy hose, Pull vp thy spirits, it will be quickly doone, A blow or two at most will serue the turne. Head. Forgiue me sir your death, Fal. Forgiue thee? I and giue thee too, Hold, there is some few crownes for thee to drinke, Tush weepe not man, giue loosers leaue to plaine, And yet ifaith my losse I count a gaine, First let me see, is thy axe sharpe inough, I am indifferent, wel a Gods name to this geare, Head. Come &amp; yeeld your head gently to the blocke, Fal. Gently sayst thou? thou wilt not vse mee so: But all is one for that, what strength hast thou: Throughout the whole proportion of thy limbes, Reuoke it all into thy manly armes, And spare me not, I am a Gentleman, A Neuill and a Falconbridge beside, Then do thy work, thou maist get credit by it, For if thou dost not, I must tell thee plaine, I shall be passing angrie when tis doone. Head. I warrant you sir, none in the land shall do it better. Fal. Why now thou pleasest me, England farewel, And old Plantagenet, if thou suruiue, Thinke on my loue, although it did not thriue. He is led forth. Mor. As for his head, it shall be sent with speed To London, and the promised reward, Allotted for the apprehending him, Be giuen vnto the poore of Southhampton here: How say you Captaine, are you so content? Cap. With all my heart, but I do maruel much We heare not of the messenger wee sent, To giue the King intelligence of this? M. Take truce with your surmises, here he comes. Enter a Messenger. Fellow it seemes that thou art slow of gate, Or very negligent in our affayres, What saies King Edward to our seruice done? Mes. To answere you directly and as breefely, I spoke not with him, for when I was come, To Drayton Basset, where they said hee was, Twas told me there, that euen the night before, His highnes in al haste, was rid towards London: The occasion, Henries death within the Tower, Of which the people are in sundry tales, Some thinking he was murdred, some againe Supposing that he dyed a naturall death. Mor. Well how so ere, that concernes not vs, We haue to doe with no mans death, but his, That for his treason here hath lost his head. Come let vs giue direction as before, And afterward make backe vnto the shore. Exeunt. Enter the Lord Maior in his scarlet gowne, with a guilded rapier by his side. Ma. I marie Crosbie this befittes thee well, But some will meruaile that with a scarlet gowne, I weare a guilded rapier by my side: Why let them know, I was knighted in the field, For my good seruice to my Lord the king, And therefore I may weare it lawfully, In Court, in Cittie, or at any royall banquet. But soft Iohn Crosbie, thou forgetst thy selfe, And dost not mind thy birth and parentage, Where thou wast borne, and whence thou art deriu'de, I doo not shame to say, the Hospitall Of London was my chiefest fostering place, There did I learne, that neare vnto a Crosse, Commonly called Cow Crosse neare Islington, An honest Cittizen did chaunce to find me, A poore Shoemaker by trade he was, And doubting of my Christendome or no, Calde me according to the place he found me, Iohn Crosby, finding me so by a Crosse. The Maisters of the Hospitall at further yeares, Bound me apprentise to the Grocers trade, Wherein God pleasde to blesse my poor endeuours That by his blessinges I am come to this. The man that found me I haue well requited, And to the Hospitall my fostering place, An hundred pound a yeare I giue for euer, Likewise in memorie of me Iohn Crosby In Bishopsgate streete a poore house haue I built, And as my name haue called it Crosbie house, And when as God shall take me from this life, In little S. Hellens will I be buried: All this declares, I boast not of my birth, But found on earth, I must returne to earth. But God for his pittie I forget my selfe, The king my soueraigne Lord will come anone, And nothing is as yet in readines. Where are ye Cosin Shoar? nay where is Mistresse Shoare? Oh I am sory that shee stayes so long, See what it is to be a widower, And lacke a Lady Maioresse in such need. Enter M. Shoare, and Mistresse Shoare. Oh are ye come? welcome good Cosin Shoare, But you indeed are welcome gentle Niece. Needes must you be our Lady Maioresse now, And helpe vs, or else we are shamde for euer, Good Cosin still thus am I bolde with you. Sh. With al my hart my Lord, and thank ye too, That you do please to vse our homely helpe. Ma. Why see how neatly shee bestirres her selfe, And in good sooth makes huswifery to shine? Ah had my Lady Maioresse liu'de to see Faire Mistresse Shoar thus beautifie her house, She would haue beene not little proud thereof. Iane. Well my Lord Maior I thanke you for that flout, But let his Highnesse now come when he please, All thinges are in a perfect readines. They bring foorth a Table, and serue in the Banquet. Maior. The more am I beholding Niece to you, That take such paines to saue our credit now: My seruantes are so slacke, his Maiestie, Might haue been here before we were preparde, But peace here comes his Highnes. The Trumpets sound, and enters king Edward, How. Sellinger, and the traine. K. Now my Lord Maior, haue we not kept our word? Because we could not stay to dine with you: At our departure hence, we promised, First food we tasted at our backe returne, Should be with you, still yeelding hearty thankes, To you and all our London Cittizens, For the great seruice which you did performe Against that bold facde rebel Falconbridge. M. My gratious Lord what then we did, We did account no more then was our duty, Thereto obliged by true Subiectes zeale, And may he neuer liue that not defendes, The honor of his king and Countrie: Next thank I God, it likes your Maiestie, To blesse my poor roofe with your royal presence, To me could come no greater happines. K. Thankes good Lord Maior, but wheres my Lady Maioresse, I hope that shee will bid vs welcome too? M. Shee would my Liedge, and with no little ioy, Had shee but liu'd to see this blessed day, But in her steed this Gentlewoman here, My Cosins wife, that office will supply: How say you Mistresse Shoare? K. How? mistresse Shoare? what not his wife That did refuse his knighthood at our hand? Ma. The very same my Lord and here hee is. K. What M. Shoare, we are your debter still, But by Gods grace entend not so to die: And Gentlewoman, now before your face, I must condemne him of discourtesie, Yea, and of great wrong that he hath offred you, For you had been a Lady but for him, He was in fault, trust me he was to blame, To hinder vertue of her due by right. Iane. My gratious L. my poor &amp; humble thoghts, Nere had an eye to such vnworthines, And though some hold it as a Maxime, That womens mindes by nature doo aspire, Yet how both God and M. Shoare I thanke For my continuance in this humble state, And likewise how I loue your Maiestie: For gratious sufferance that it may be so: Heauen beare true record of my inward soule, Now it remaines, on my Lord Maiors behalfe, I doe such duty as becommeth me, To bid your Highnes welcome to his house, Were welcomes vertue powerfull in my word, The king of England should not doubt thereof. Ki. Nor do I Mistresse Shoar, now my L. Maior Edward dare boldly sweare that he is welcome, You spake the word well, very well yfaith, But Mistresse Shoare her tongue hath guilded it, Tell me Cosin Howard and Tom Sellinger, Had euer Citizen so faire a wife? How. Of flesh and bloud I neuer did behold, A woman euery way so absolute. Sel. Nor I my Liedge, were Sellinger a king, He could afforde Shoares wife to be a Queene. K. Why how now Tom? Nay rather how now Ned? What change is this? proud, saucie roauing eye, What whisperst in my braine, that shee is faire? I know it, I see it, fayrer then my Queene? Wilt thou maintaine it,? what and thou traitor hart, UUouldst thou shake hands in this conspiracie? Downe rebell, backe base trecherous conceite, I will not credite thee, my Besse is faire, And Shoares wife but a blouze, comparde to her, Come let vs sit, here will I take my place. And my Lord Maior, fill me a bowle of wine, That I may drinke to your elected Maioresse, And M. Shoare tell me how like you this, My L. Maior makes your wife his L. Maioresse? Sho. So well my Lord as better cannot be, All in the honor of your Maiestie. The Lord Maior bringes a bowle of wine, and humbly on his knees offers it to the king. Ki. Nay drinke to vs L. Maior, weele haue it so, Go to I say, you are our Taster now, Drinke then, and we will pledge yee. Ma. All health and happines to my Soueraign. he drinkes K. Fill full our cup, and Lady Maioresse, This full carowse we meane to drinke to you, And you must pledge vs, but yet no more, Then you shall please to answere vs withall. He drinkes, &amp; the Trumpets sound, then wine is brought to her, and shee offers to drinke. Nay you must drinke to some body, yea Tom to thee? Well sirra, see you doe her right: For Edward would, oh would to God he might. Yet idle eye, wilt thou be gadding still? Keepe home, keepe home, for feare of further ill. Enter a Messenger with letters. How now? letters to vs, from whome? Mes. My Liedge, this from the D. of Burgundie. And this is from the Constable of France. K. What newes from them? He opens the letter and reades. To claime our right in France? And they will aide vs, yea, will ye so? But other aide must aide vs ere we goe. He seemes to reade the letters but glaunces on Mistresse Shoare in his reading. A womans aid that hath more power th? France To crowne vs or to kill vs with mischance. If chast resolue be to such beautie tyed, Sue how thou canst, thou wilt be still denied, Her husband hath deserued well of thee, Tut, loue makes no respect where ere it be, Thou wrongst thy Queen: Euery enforced ill, Must be endurde where beautie seekes to kill: Thou seemst to reade, onely to blind their eyes, Who knowing it, thy follie would despise. He startes from the Table. Thanks for my cheare L. Maior, I am not well, I know not how to take these newes. This fit I meane, That hath bereft me of all reason cleane. M. God shield my Soueraigne. K. Nay nothing I shall be well anone. Ian. May it please your Highnes sit. K. I, faine with thee, nay we must needs be gon, Cosin Howard conuey these letters to our Councell, And bid them giue vs their aduise of them, Thankes for my cheare L. Maior, farewell to you And farewel Mistresse Shoare, La. Maioresse I should say, Tis you haue causde our parting at this time. Farewell M. Shoare, farewell to all, Weele meet once more to make amends for this. Exeunt King. How. and Sel. M. Oh God here to be ill? My house to cause my Soueraignes discontent? Cosin Shoare I had rather spent. Sho. Content your selfe my L. kinges haue their humors, The letters did containe somewhat no doubt, That did displease him. Ia. So my Lord thinke I, But by Gods helpe he will be well againe. M. I hope so too, well Cosin for your paines, I can but thanke ye, chiefely you faire Niece, At night I pray ye both come sup with me, How say ye? will yee? Sh. Yes my Lord wee will. So for this time we humbly take our leaue. Exeunt Shoare and his wife. M. Oh how the sudden sicknesse of my Liedge, Afflictes my soule with many passions? His Highnes did entend to be right merie, And God he knowes how it would glad my soule, If I had seene his Highness satisfied With the poore entertainement of his Maior, His humble vassaile, whose lands, whose life and al Are, and in dutie must be alwaies his. Well, God I trust will blesse his Graces health, And quicklie ease him of his sudden fit. Take away there ho, rid this place, And God of heauen blesse my Soueraigns Grace. Exit Enter two prentizes preparing the Goldsmiths Shop with plate. 1. Pren. Sirra Iacke, come set out. 2. Pr. You are the elder Prentise, I pray you do it, least my Mistresse talke with you when shee comes downe, what is it a clocke? 1. P. Six by Allhallowes. 2. Pre. Lying and stealing will bring ye to the Gallowes. Is here all the plate? 1. P. I that must serue to day. Where is the weightes and ballance? 2. Pr. All readie, harke my Mistresse comes. Exit 1. Pren. Enter Mistresse Shoare with her worke in her hand. Ia. Sir Boy, while I attend the shop my selfe, See if the workeman haue dispatcht the Cup, How many ounces weighes it? 2 Pr. Twenty forsooth. Ia. What said the Gentleman to the fashion? 2. P. He told my Maister, I was not within. I. Goe Sir make haste, your M. is in Cheapside: Take heed ye were best your loitring be not spide. The boy departs, and shee sits sowing in her shop. Enter the king disguised. Ki. UUell fare a Case to put a king in yet, Good Mistris Shoar this doth your loue procure, This shape is secret, and I hope ti's sure, The UUatermen that daylie vse the Court, And see me often, knew me not in this, At Lyon key I landed in their view, Yet none of them tooke knowledge of the king, If anie gallant striue to haue the wall, Ile yeeld it gentlie: Soft here must I turne, Heres Lumbard streete, and heres the Pellican, And theres the Phenix in the Pellicans nest, O rare perfection of rich natures worke, Bright twinckling sparke of pretious Diamond, Of greater value then all India, Were there no Sunne, by whose kind louelie heat The earth bringes forth those stones wee holde of prize, Her radient eyes deiected to the ground, UUould turne each peble to a Diamond. Gaze greedie eyes and be not satisfied, Till you find rest, where harts desire doth bide. I. What wold you buy Sir that you looke on here? K. Your fairest Iewel, be it not too deare. First how this Saphire Mistresse that you weare? I. Sir it is right that will I warrant yee, No Ieweller in London showes a better. K. Ed. No, nor the like, you praise it passing well. Iane. Do I? no, if some Lapidarie had the stone, more would not buy it then I can demaund. Tis as wel set I think as ere yee saw. K. Ed. Tis set indeed vpon the fairest hand, that ere I saw. Iane. You are disposde to iest, but for the value, his maiestie might weare it. King Ed. Might hee ifaith? Iane. Sir tis the ring I meane. Ki. Ed. I meant the hand. Iane. You are a merrie man, I see you come to cheape, and not to buy. King Ed. Yet hee that offers fairer then Ile doe, shal hardly find a partner in his bargaine. Iane. Perhaps in buying things of so small value? K. Rather because no wealth can purchase it. Iane. Hee were too fond, that would so highly prize, The thing which once was giuen away for loue. K. His hap was good that came so easily by it. Iane. The gift so small, that askte, who could denie it? King. Oh she gaue more, that such a gift then gaue, Then earth ere had, or world shall euer haue. Iane. His hap is ill, should it be as you say, That hauing giuen him what you rate so high, And yet is still the poorer by the match. King. That easily prooues he doth not know the woorth. Iane. Yet hauing had the vse of it so long, It rather prooues you ouer-rate the thing, He beeing a chapman, as it seemes you are. King. Indeede none should aduenture on the thing, Thats to bee purchaste onely by a King. Iane. If kings loue that, which no man else respects, It may be so, else do I see small reason, A king should take delight in such course stuffe. King. Liues there a king, that would not giue his crowne, To purchase such a kingdom of content? Iane. In my conceit, right well you aske that question, The world I thinke containes not such fond king. King. Why mistris Shoare, I am the man will do it. Iane. Its proudelie spoke, although I not beleeue it. Were he King Edward that should offer it. King. But shall I haue it? Iane. Uppon what acqaintance? King. Why since I saw thee last. Iane. Where was that? King. At the Lord Maiors, in the presence of the King. Iane. I haue forgotten that I sawe you there, For there were many that I tooke small note of. King. Of me you did, and we had some discourse. Iane. You are deceiued Sir, I had then no time, For my attendance on his maiestie. King. Ile gage my hand vnto your hand of that, Looke well vppon me. He discouers himselfe. Iane. Now I beseech you let this strange disguise, Excuse my boldnesse to your maiestie. (she kneeles What euer we possesse is al your highnesse, Onely mine honour, which I cannot graunt, K. Onely thy loue (bright angell) Edward craues, For which I thus aduentured to see thee. Enter maister Shoare. Iane. But here comes one, to whom I onely gaue it, And he I doubt wil say you shall not haue it. King. Am I so soone cut off? oh spight. How say ye mistris, will ye take my offer? Iane. Indeede I cannot sir afford it so King. Youle not be offered fairlier I beleeue. Iane. Indeede you offer like a Gentleman. But yet the Iewell will not so bee left. Sho. Sir, if you bid not too much vnder-foot. Ile driue the bargaine twixt you and my wife. Ki. Alas good Shoare, my self dare answere no. King aside. Nothing can make thee such a Iewell forgoe. Shee saith you shall be too much looser by it. Sho. See in the rowe then, if you can speede better, Ki. See many worlds arow, affoords not like. As he goes forth, Shoare lookes earnestly, and perceiues it is the king, whereat he seemeth greatly discontented. I. Why lookst thou Mat? knowst thou the gentlem?? Alas what ailes thee that thou lookst so pale? What cheere sweet heart? alas, where hast thou been? Sho. Nay nothing Iane, know you the Gentleman? Iane. Not I sweete heart, alas why do you aske? Is he thine enemie? Shore. I cannot tell, What came hee here to cheapen at our shoppe? Iane. This Iewell loue. Sho. Well I pray God he came for nothing else. Iane. Why who is it? I do suspect him Shoare. That you demaund thus doubtfully of me. Sho. Ah Iane, it is the King. Iane. The king? what then? is it for that thou sighst? Were he a thousand kings thou hast no cause To feare his presence, or suspect my loue. Sho. I knowe I haue not, see hee comes againe. The king enters againe, muffled in his cloke. King. Still is my hindrer there? be patient heart, Some fitter season must asswage the smart, What will ye take that mistrisse whic I offred ye? I come againe sir, as one willing to buy. Iane. Indeede I cannot sir, I pray ye Deale with my husband, heare what hee will say. Sho. Ile sell it worth your money, if you please, I pray ye come neere sir. King. I am too neere alreadie, thou so neere. Nay, nay, she knowes what I did offer her, And in good sadnesse, I can giue no more, So fare ye well sir, I will not deale with you. Exit. Iane. You are deceiude (sweet hart) tis not the king, Thinke you hee would aduenture thus alone? Sho. I do assure thee Iane it is the king. Oh God, twixt the extreames of loue and feare, In what a shiuering ague sits my soule? Keepe wee our treasure secret, yet so fond, As set so rich a beautie as this is, In the wide viewe of euerie gazers eye. Oh traitor beautie, Oh deceitfull good, That dost conspire against thy selfe and loue, No sooner got, but wisht againe of others, In thine owne selfe, iniurious to thy selfe, Oh rich poore portion, thou good euill thing? How many ioyfull woes still dost thou bring, Ia. I pray thee come, sweete loue, and sit by mee, No King thats vnder heau? I loue like thee. exit. Enter sir Humphrey Bowes, and master Aston, being two Iustices, Harrie Grudgen, Robert Goodfellow, and Iohn Hobs the Tanner. Bowes. Neighbours &amp; friends, the cause that you are called, Concerns the Kings most excellent maiestie, Whose right you know by his progenitors, Unto the Crowne and soueraignty of France, Is wrongfullie detained by the French, Which to reuenge and royallie regaine. His Highnes meanes to put himselfe in Armes, And in his princely person to conduct His warlicke troupes against the enemie. But for his Coffers are vnfurnished, Through ciuill discord and intestine warre, (Whose bleeding scarres our eyes may yet behold) He prayes his faithfull louing subiectes helpe, To further this his iust great enterprize. Hob. So the fecke and meaning, whereby as it were of all your long purgation Sir Humphrey is no more in some respect, but the king wants money, &amp; would haue some of his Comentie. Bo. Tanner you rightly vnderstand the matter. Ast. Note this withall, where his dread Maiesty, (Our lawfull soueraigne, and most royall king) Might haue exacted or imposde a Taxe, Or borrowed greater summes then we can spare, (For all we haue is at his dread commande,) He doth not so, but mildly doth entreat Our kind beneuolence, what we wil giue, With willing minds towards this mighty charge. Enter Lord Howard. Which to receiue, his noble Counsellor And kinsman the Lord Howard here is come. H. Now good Sir Humphrey Bowes &amp; M. Aston, Haue yee declared the kings most gratious pleasure? Bowes. We haue my Lord. How. His Highnes will not force. As loane or tribute, but will take your gift, In gratefull part and recompence your loue. B.

Aston, you both shew your loue, Now aske your neighbours what they will bestow? Bow. Come M. Hadland your beneuolence. Had. O good Sir Humphrey do not racke my purse, You know my state I latelie sold my land. Aston. Then you haue money, let the king haue part. Hob. I, do M. Hadland do, they say you sold a foule deale of durty land for faire gold and siluer, let the king haue some now while you haue it, for if yee bee forborne a while, all will be spent, for he that cannot keepe land that lyes fast, will haue much a do to hold money, its slipperie ware, tis melting ware, tis melting ware. How. Gramercy Tanner. Bowes. Say, what shall we haue? Hadland. My forty shillinges. Aston. Robert Goodfellow. I know you will be liberall to the king. Good. O M. Aston be content I pray ye, You know my charge, my household very great, And my housekeeping holdes me very bare: Threescore vprising, and downe lying Sir, Spendes no small store of vittailes in a yeare, Two brace of Greyhounds xx. couple of houndes, And then my Iades deuoure a deale of Corne, My Christmas cost and then my frends that come Amounts to charge, I am Robin Goodfellow, That welcomes all and keepes a frolicke house, I haue no money pray ye pardon me. How. Heeres a plaine Tanner can teach ye how to thriue Keepe fewer dogs, and then ye may feede men: Yet feede no idle men, tis needles charge, You that on Hounds &amp; hunting mates will spend, No doubt but something to your king youl send.

Grudgen. Gep goodman Tanner, are yee so round? your prolicatenes has brought your sonne to the Gallowes almost, you can be franke of an other mans cost. Hob.

His benegligence? hang him heele not giue a penny willingly. Gr. I care not much to cast away forty pence. Ho. Out grudging pesant, base il nurturd groome, Is this the loue thou bearest vnto the king? Gentlemen take notice of the slaue, And if he fault let him be soundly plagude? Now frolicke Tanner, what wilt thou affoorde? Hob. Twenty old Aungels and a score of hydes, if that be too little, take twentie Nobles more, while I haue it my king shall spend of my store. How. The king shall know thy louing liberall hart. Hob. Shall hee yfaith, I thanke ye hartely, but heare yee Gentleman you come from the Court? How. I doe. Hob.

Ile wean Brocke my mares fole, and come vp to the king, and it shall go hard but two fat hennes for your paines I will bring. Bowes. My Lord this fellow gladly now will giue, fiue poundes so you will pardon his rude speech. How. For fiue and fiue I cannot brooke the beast. Grud. UUhat giues the Tanner, I am as wel able as he?

UUhat haue ye sau'de now goodman Grudgen, by your hinching and your pinching, not the worth of a blacke pudding. Exeunt. Enter mistris Shoare, and mistris Blage. M. Bla. Now mistris Shoare, what vrgent cause is that, Which made ye send for me in such great haste? I promise ye it made me halfe afraide, you were not wel. Iane. Trust me, nor sicke, nor well, but troubled still with the disease I told yee: heere is another letter from the King, was neuer poore soule so importuned. M. Blage. But will no answere serue? Iane. No mistresse Blage, no answere will suffize. He, he it is, that with a violent siedge Labours to breake into my plighted faith, Oh what am I, he should so much forget His Royall State, and his High Maiestie? Still doth he come disguised to my house, And in most humble termes bewrayes his loue, My husband greeues, alas how can he choose, Fearing the dispossessment of his Iane? And when he cannot come (for him) he writes, Offering beside incomparable gifts, And all to winne me to his princely will. M. Bla. Beleeue me M. Shoare, a dangerous case, And euerie way repleate with doubtfull feare, If you should yeeld, your vertuous name were foylde, And your beloued husband made a scorn. And if not yeeld, its likely that his loue, Which now admires ye, will conuert to hate, And who knowes not a princes hate is death? Yet I will not be she shall counsaile yee, Good mistris Shoare do what ye will for me. Iane. Then counsaile me what I were best to doe: M. B. You know his greatnesse can dispense with ill, Making the sinne seeme lesser by his worth, And you your selfe, your children and your friendes, Be all aduaunced to worldly dignitie, And this worlds pompe you know is a goodly thing. Yet I will not be shee shall counsaile ye, Good mistris Shoare do what ye will for mee. Iane. Alas I know that I was bound by oath, To keepe the promise that I made at first, And vertue liues, when pompe consumes to dust. M. Blage. So we do say, dishonour is no shame, When slaunder does not touch th'offenders name, You shall be folded in a princes armes, Whose becke disperseth euen the greatest harmes, Many that sit themselues in high degree, Will then be glad to stoope, and bende the knee, And who ist, hauing plentie in the hand, Neuer commaunded, but doth still command, That cannot worke in such excesse of things, To quit the guilt, one small transgression brings? Yet I wil not be shee shal counsaile ye, Good mistris Shoare do what ye wil for mee. Iane. Here do I liue, although in meane estate, Yet with a conscience free from al debate, Where higher footing may in time procure, A sudden fal, and mixe my sweete with sowre. Mi. Blage. True, I confesse a priuately life is good, Nor would I otherwise be vnderstood, To be a Goldsmiths wife is some content, But daies in court more pleasantly are spent, A housholds gouernment deserues renowne, But what is a companion to a crowne? The name of mistresse is a prettie thing, But Madam at each word doth glorie bring Yet I wil not be shee shall counsell yee, Good mistris Shoare do what ye will for mee. Ia. Oh that I knew which were the best of twaine, Which for I do not, I am sicke with paine. Enter her Boy. How now Sir boy, what is the newes with you? Boy. The Gentleman forsooth the other day, That would haue bought the Iewell at our stall, Is here to speake with yee. Iane. Oh God it is the king. Good mistris Blague withdraw ye from this place, Ile come anon, so soone as hee is gone, And sirra get you to the shoppe againe. Exit Boy. M. Bla. Now mistris Shoare bethinke ye what to doo, Such suters come not euerie day to wooe. Mistris Blague departs, and the King enters in his former disguise K. Thou maist conuict me (beauties pride) of boldnesse, That I intrude like an vnbidden guest, But loue being guide, my fault will seeme the lesse. Iane. Most welcome to your subiects homely roofe, The foote, my Soueraigne, seldome doth offend, Unlesse the heart some other hurt intende. King. The most thou seest is hurt vnto my selfe, How for thy sake, is maiestie disroabde? Riches made poore, and dignitie brought lowe, Onelie that thou mightst our affection knowe. Iane. The more the pittie, that within the skie, The sunne that should all other vapours drie, And guide the world with his most glorious light, Is muffled vp himselfe in wilfull night. K. The want of thee, faire Cinthia is the cause, Spread thou thy siluer-brightnesse in the aire, And strait the gladsome morning will appeare. Iane. I may not wander, hee that guides my carre, Is an immooued constant, fixed starre, King. But I wil giue that starre a comets name, And shield both thee and him from further blame. Iane. How if the host of heauen at this abuse Repine? who can the prodigie excuse? King. It lies within the compasse of my powre, To dim their enuious eies, dare seeme to lowre, But leauing this our Enigmatike talke, Thou must sweete Iane repaire vnto the court, His tongue intreates, controles the greatest peere, His hand plights loue, a royal scepter holdes, And in his heart hee hath confirmde thy good, Which may not, must not, shal not be withstood. Iane. If you enforce me, I haue nought to say, But wish I had not liude to see this day. K. Blame not the time, thou shalt haue cause to ioy. Iane in the euening I wil send for thee, And thou and thine shall bee aduancde by mee. In signe whereof receiue this true-loue kisse, Nothing ill meant, there can bee no amisse. Exit. Iane. Well I wil in, and ere the time beginne, Learne how to be repentant for my sinne. Exit. Enter Lord Maior, maister Shoare, and Fraunces Emersley. Maior. But Cosin Shoare, are yee assurde it was the King you sawe in such disguise? Sho. Do I know you the vncle to my wife? know I Franke Emersley her brother here? so surely doo I know that counterfeit to bee King. Frances. Well, admitte al this. And that his Maiestie in such disguise, please to suruey the manners of our Cittie, or what occasion else may like himselfe. Mee thinks you haue small reason brother Shoare, to be displeasde thereat. Mai. Oh I haue found him nowe. Because my niece his wife is beautifull, And well reputed for her vertuous partes: He in his fond conceit misdoubtes the King, Doth doate on her in his affection. I know not Cosin how shee may be changde, By any cause in you procuring it: From the faire cariage of her wonted course: But well I wot, I haue oft heard you say, Shee merited no scruple of mislike. If now some gyddy fancie in your braine, Make you conceiue sinisterly of her, And with a person of such difference. I tell you Cosin, more for her respect, Then to sooth you in such a sottishnes, I would reueale yee open to the world, And let your follie iusty plague your selfe. Sh. Unckle you are too forward in your rage, And much mistake me in this suddennes, Your Nieces reputation haue I prizde, And shrined as deuoutely in my soule As you, or any that it can concerne. For when I tell you that it is the king, Comes muffled like a common Seruingman, Doe I inferre thereby my wife is false? Or swerues one iot from wonted modestie. Though in my shop shee sit, more to respect, Her seruantes dutie, then for any skill, Shee doth, or can pretend in what we trade, Is it not strange, that euer when hee comes, It is to her, and will not deale with me? Ah Unckle Franke, nay, would all her kin, Were here to censure of my cause aright: Though I misdeeme not her, yet giue me leaue, To doubt what his slie walking may entend. And let me tell yee, he that is possest, Of such a beautie, feares vndermining guestes: Especiallie a mightie one, like him, Whose greatnes may guilde ouer vglie sinne. But say his comming is not to my wife, Then hath he some slie aiming at my life, By false compounded mettalles, or light gold, Or else some other trifle to be solde. When kinges themselues so narrowly do prie Into the world, men feare, and why not I? Fran. Belieue me brother in this doubtfull case I know not wel how I should answere yee, I wonder in this serious busie time, Of this great gathered beneuolence, For his regaining of his right in France, The day and nightly turmoile of his Lordes, Yea of the whole estate in generall, He can be spared from these great affaires, And wander here disguised in this sort. But is not this your boy? Enter the Boy. Sho. Yes marie is it: how now, what newes with thee? Boy. Maister, my Mistresse by a Nobleman, Is sent for to the king in a close Coach, Shees gon with him, these are the newes I bring. Ma. How? my Niece sent for to the king? By a Nobleman, and she is gone with him? Nay, then I like it not? Frank. How, gone saiest thou? S. Be patient Unckle, storme not gentle Frank: The wrong is mine, by whome? a king, To talke of such it is no common thing, She is gone thou saiest? Boy. Yes truely Sir, tis so. Sh. I cannot helpe it, a Gods name let her goe, You cannot helpe it Unckle, no, nor you, Where kinges are medlers, meaner men must rue I storme against it? no, farewell Iane Shoare, Once thou wast mine, but must be so no more. Maior. Gone to the Court? Exit Maior. Shoar. Yet vnkle will ye rage? Let mine example your high heate asswage. To note offences in a mightie man It is enough, amend it he that can, Franke Emersley, my wife thy sister was, Lands, goods and all I haue to thee I passe, Saue that poore portion must along with me, To beare me from this badge of obloquie, It neuer shall be said that Mathew Shoare, A kinges dishonour in his bonnet wore. Fran. Good Brother. Sh. Striue not to change me, for I am resolude, And will not tarrie. England fare thou well, And Edward, for requiting me so well, But dare I speake of him? forbeare, forbeare. Come Franke I will surrender all to thee, And then abroade, where ere my fortunes be. Exeunt. Enter king Edward, Howard, Sellinger, &amp;c. K. And haue our Countrie subiects been so franke And bountifull in their beneuolence: Toward our present expedition? Thankes Cosin Howard for thy paines herein: We will haue letters sent to euery Shire Of thankeful gratitude, that they may know, How highly we respect their gentlenes. How. One thing my L. I had well neer forgot, Your pleasant hoast the Tanner of Tamwoorth. Kin. What of him Cosin? Ho. Hee was right liberall, Twenty old Angels did he send your Grace, And others seeing him so bountifull, Stretcht further then otherwise they had done. K. Trust me I must requite that honest Tanner. Oh had he kept his word, and come to Court, Then in good sadnesse we had had good sport. How. That is not long my L. which comes at last Hees come to London, on an earnest cause, His sonne lies prisoner in Stafford Iayle, And is condemned for a robberie. Your Highnes pardoning his sonnes offence, May yeeld the Tanner no meane recompence. K. But who hath seen him since he came to town? Sel. My Lord in Holborn twas my hap to see him Gazing about, I sent away my men, And clapping on one of their liuerie cloakes, Came to him, and the Tanner knew me straite, How dost thou Tom? and how doth Ned quoth he That honest merie Hangman, how doth he? I knowing that your Maiestie entended This day in person to come to the Tower, There bad him meete me, where Ned and I, Would bring him to the presence of the King, And there procure a pardon for his sonne. Ki. Haue then a care we be not seene of him, Untill we be prouided for the purpose, Because once more weele haue a little sport, Tom Sellinger, let that care be yours. Sel. I warrant yee my Lord let me alone. Enter the Lord Maior. K. Welcome L. Maior, what haue you signifyed, Our thankefulnes vnto our Citizens, For their late gathered beneuolence? Ma. Before the Cittizens in our Guildhall, Maister Recorder made a good oration, Of thankefull gratitude vnto them all, Which they receyued with so kind respect, And loue vnto your roiall maiestie, As it appearde to vs they sorrowed, Their bountie to your Highnes was no more, King. Lord Maior, thanks to your selfe and them, And goe ye with vs nowe into the Towre, To see the order that wee shall obserue, In this so needfull preparation, The better may you signifie to them, What neede there was of their beneuolence. Mai. Ile waite vpon your gracious maiestie, Yet there is one thing that much grieueth me. aside. Exeunt. Enter Shoare, and two watermen bearing his trunkes. Sho. Go honest fellow, beare my trunkes aboord, And tell the maister ile come presently. Enter mistris Shoare Lady-like attired, with diuers supplications in her hand, she vnpinning her mask, and attended on by many sutors. 1 Wa. We wil sir, but what Lady haue we here? Belike she is of no meane countenance, That hath so many sutors waiting on her. Sho. Go one of you I pray ye, enquire her name, 1. Wa. My honest friend, what Ladie cal ye this? Aire. Her name is mistris Shoare, the kings beloued A special friend to sutors at the court. S. Her name is mistris Shore the kings beloued, Where shall I hide my head, or stoppe mine eares, But like an owle I shall be wondred at? When she with me was wont to walk the streets, The people then as she did passe along, Would say, there goes faire modest mistris Shore, When she attended like a Cittie Dame, Was praised of Matrons, So that Cittizens, when they would speak of ought vnto their wiues Fetcht their example still from mistris Shoare, But now she goes deckt in her courtly robes, This is not shee, that once in seemely blacke, Was the chaste, sober wife of Mathew Shoare, For now shee is King Edwards Concubine, Oh great ill title, honourable shame, Her good I had, but king her ill is thine, Once Shoares true wife, now Edwards concubine. Amongst the rest Ile note her new behauiour. All this while shee standes conferring priuately with her sutors, and looking on their billes. Aier. Good mistresse Shoare remember my sonnes life. Iane. What is thy name? Aire. My name is Thomas Aire. Iane. There is his pardon signed by the King. Aire. In signe of humble heartie thankfulnes, Take this in Angels twentie pound. Iane. What thinke ye, that I buy and sell for bribes, His highnesse fauour, or his subiects bloud? No, without gifts God grant I may do good, For al my good cannot redeeme my ill, Yet to do good I will endeuour still. Sho. Yet all this good doth but guild ore thy ill. aside. Palmer. Mistris the restitution of my landes. Taken perforce by his highnesse officers. Iane. The King is content your goods shall bee restorde, But the officers will hardly yeeld thereto, Yet bee content, Ile see yee haue no wrong. Sho. Thou canst not say to mee so, I haue wrong. Iockie. Mistresse gude faith gin yeele help me til my laund, whilk the fause loune Billie Grime of Glendale haudz wr?fully frea me: Ile white your gudenes with a bonnie nag, sal swum away so deftly as the winde. Iane. Your sute my friend, requires a longer time, Yet since you dwell so farre off, to ease your charge, Your diet with my seruants you may take, And some releefe Ile get thee of the king. Shoare. Its cold releefe thou getst mee from the King. Iockie. Now Gods blessing light on that gudely faire face, ise be your true beadsman mistresse, I indeed, sall I. Pal. God blesse the care you haue of dooing good. Aire. Pittie she should miscarrie in her life, That beares so sweete a mind in dooing good. Shoare. So say I too, ah Iane this killes my heart, That thou recks others, and not ru'st my smart. Rufford. Mistresse I feare you haue forgot my sute? Iane. Oh, tis for a licence to transport Corne from this land, and lead to forraigne Realmes, I had your bill, but I haue torne your bill, and twere no shame I thinke, to teare your eares, that care not howe you wound the common wealth. The poore must starue for foode to fill your purse, And the enemie bandie bullets of our lead. No Maister Rufford, Ile not speake for you, except it be to haue you punished. Iockie. By the messe a deft lasse, Christ benison light on her. She espies her husband walking aloofe off, and not knowing him, takes him for another Sutor. Iane. Is that another sutor? I haue no bill of his, Go one of you, and knowe what hee would haue. Sho. Yes Iane, the bill of my obliged faith, And I had thine, but thou hast canceld it. Here she knowes him, and lamenting, comes to him. Iane. Oh God it is my husband, kind Mathew Shoare. Shoare. Ah Iane, whats he dare say he is thy husband? Thou wast a wife, but now thou art not so, Thou wast a maide, a maide when thou wast wife, Thou wast a wife, euen when thou wast a maide, So good, so modest, and so chaste thou wast, But now thou art diuorcde, whiles yet hee liues, That was thy husband, while thou wast his wife. Thy wifehood stainde, by thy dishonoured life, For now thou art nor widdow, maide, nor wife. Iane. I must confesse I yeelded vp the Forte, Wherein lay all the riches of thy ioy, But yet sweete Shoare, before I yeelded it, I did endure the longst and greatest siege, That euer battred on poore chastitie, And but to him that did assault the same, For euer it had beene inuincible, But I will yeeld it backe againe to thee. He cannot blame me, though it bee so done, To loose by me, what first by me was wonne. Sho. No Iane, there is no place allowde for mee, Where once a King hath tane possession, Meane men brook not a Riuall in their loue, Much lesse so High vnriuallde Maiestie, A concubine to one so great as Edward, Is farre too great to bee the wife of Shoare, Iane. I will refuse the pleasures of the Court, Let me go with thee Shoare, though not as a wife, Yet as thy slaue, since I haue lost that name, I will redeeme the wrong that I haue done thee, With my true seruice, if thou wilt accept it. Sho. Thou go with mee Iane, oh God forbid, That I should be a traitour to my King, Shal I become a fellon to his pleasures, And flie away as guiltie of the theft? No my deere Iane, I say it may not bee, Oh what haue subiects that is not their kings, Ile not examine his prerogatiue. Ia. Why then sweet Mat, let me intreat thee stay, What ist with Edward that I cannot do? Ile make thee wealthier then ere Richard was, That entertainde the three greatst kinges in Europe, And feasted them in London on a daie Aske what thou wilt, were it a million, That may content thee, thou shalt haue it Shoare. Sho. Indeede this were some comfort to a man, That tasted want or worldlie miserie, But I haue lost what wealth cannot returne, Al worldlie losses are but toyes to mine, Oh, al my wealth, the losse of thee was more, Then euer time or Fortune can restore. Therefore sweete Iane farewel, once thou wast mine, Too rich for me, and that King Edward knewe, Adiew, Oh world, he shall deceiued bee, That puts his trust in women or in thee. Ia. Ah Shoar farewel, poore heart in death Ile tell, I euer loude thee Shoare, farewel, farewell. Exit. Enter King Edward, Lord Maior, Howard, Sellenger, and the traine. King. Hauing awakte forth of their sleepie dennes, Our drouzie Cannons, which ere long shall charme, The watchful French, with deaths eternal sleepe, And al things else in readinesse for Fraunce, A while we wil giue truce vnto our care, There is a merrie Tanner neere at hand, With whom we meane to be a little merrie. Therefore Lord Maior, and you my other friendes, I must intreate you not to knowledge me, No man stand bare, all as companions, Giue me a Cloake, that I may be disguisde, Tom Sellenger, go thou and take another, So Tanner, now come when yee please, we are prouided.

What Ned? a plague found thee, how dost thou for a villaine? how dost thou madde rogue, and how, and howe? King. In health Iohn Hobs, and verie glad to see thee, But say, what winde droue thee to London. Hobs. Ah Ned, I was brought hither with a whirlwinde man, my sonne, my sonne, did I not tell thee I had a knaue to my sonne? King. Yes Tanner, what of him? Hobs. Faith hees in Caperdoche Ned, in Stafford Gaole, for a robberie, and is like to be hangde, except thou gette the King to be more miserable to him. King. If that bee all Tanner, Ile warrant him, I will procure his pardon of the King. Hobs. Wilt thou Ned? for those good words, see what my Daughter Nell hath sent thee, a handkercher wrought with as good Couentrie silke blewe threed, as euer thou sawest. King. And I perhaps may weare it for her sake, In better presence then thou art aware off. Hobs. How Ned, a better present? that canst thou not haue for silke, cloath, and workmanshippe, why Nell made it man. But Ned? is not the King in this companie, whats he in the long beard and the redde petticoate? before God I misdoubte Ned that is the King, I knowe it by my Lord what ye cals players. King. Howe by them Tanner? Hobs. Euer when they play an Enterloute or a Commoditie at Tamwoorth, the King alwaies is in a long beard, &amp; a red gowne like him, therefore I spekt him to be the king. King. No trust me Tanner, this is not the King, but thou shalt see the King before thou goest, and haue a pardon for thy sonne too with thee. This man is the Lord Maior, Lord Maior of London, heere was the Recorder too, but hee is gone. Hobs. What Nicnames these courtnoles haue? Mare and Corder quotha? we haue no such at Liechfield, there is the honest Bayliffe and his brethren, such words gree best with vs. King. My Lord Maior, I pray ye for my sake, to bidde this honest Tanner welcome. Maior. You are welcome my honest friend, In signe whereof I pray you see my house, And suppe with mee this night. Hobs. I thanke ye good goodman Maior, but I care not for no meate, my stomacke is like to a sicke swines, that will neither eate nor drinke, till shee know what shall become of her pigge. Ned and Tom, you promisde me a good turne when I came to Court, either doo it now, or go hang your selues. King. No sooner comes the King, but I will doo it. Sel. I warrant thee Tanner, feare not thy sonnes life. Hobs. Nay, I feare not his life, I feare his death. Enter Maister of Saint Katherines, and Widdow Norton. Maister. All health and happinesse to my soueraigne. King. The Master of Saint Katherines hath marde all. Hobs. Out alas that euer I was borne. The Tanner falles in a swound, they labour to reuiue him, meane while the King puts on his royall robes. King. Looke to the Tanner there, he takes no harme, I would not haue him (for my crowne) miscarrie, Wid. Let me come to him by my kings good leaue Heres ginger honest man, bite it. Hobs. Bite ginger, bite ginger, bite a dogs date, I am but a dead man, ah my Leige, that you should deale so with a poore well meaning man, but it makes no matter, I can but die. King. But when Tanner canst thou tell? Hobs. Nay euen when you please, for I haue so defended ye, by calling ye plaine Ned, mad rogue and rascall, that I know youle haue me hangde. Therefore make no more adoe, but send me downe to Stafford, and there a Gods name hang me with my son. And heres another as honest as your selfe, you made me call him plain Tom, I warrant his name is Thomas, and some man of worshippe too, therefore lets to it, euen when and where ye will. King. Tanner attende, not onely doo we pardon thee, But in all princely kindnesse welcome thee, And thy sonnes trespasse doe we pardon too, Ore goe and see that forthwith it bee drawne, Under our seale of England, as it ought, And fortie poundes wee giue thee to defray Thy charges in thy comming vp to London. Now Tanner, what sai'st thou to vs? Hobs. Marrie you speake like an honest man, if You meane as you say. King. Wee meane it Tanner, on our royall word. Now maister of S. Katherines, what would you? M. My gracious Lord, the great beneuolence, (Though small to that your subiects could affoord, Of poore Saint Katherines do I bring your grace,) Fiue hundred pounds here haue they sent by me. For the easier portage, all in Angell gold, What this good widdow Mistresse Norton will, Shee comes her selfe, and brings her gift with her. Wid. Pardon me gratious Lord, presumption, Nor ouerweening in my owne conceite, Makes me thus bold to come before your Grace, But loue and duty to your maiestie: And great desire to see my Lord the king, Our Maister here spake of beneuolence, And said my twenty Nobles was inough, I thought not so, but at your Highnes feet, A widdowes mite, a token of her zeale, In humble dutie giues you twentie pound. K. Now by my Crowne, a gallant lusty Gyrle, Of all the exhibition yet bestowed, This womans liberality likes me best. Is thy name Norton? Wid. I my gratious Liedge. K. How long hast thou beene a Widdow? Wid. It is my Lord, Since I did burie VVilkin my goodman, At Shrouetide next euen iust a dozen yeares. K. In all which space, couldst thou not find a man, On whome thou mightst bestow thy selfe againe? Wid. Not any like my Wilkin whose dear loue, I know is matchlesse, in respect of whome, I thinke not any worthy of a kisse. K. No widdow? that ile trie, how like you this? He kisseth her. Wid. Beshrew my hart, it was a honnie kisse, Able to make an aged woman young: And for the same most sweet and louely prince, See what the widdow giues you from her store, Forty olde Angels but for one kisse more. K. Marie Widdow and thou shalt haue it, Iohn Hobs thou art a widdower, Lackst thou such a wife? Hobs.
