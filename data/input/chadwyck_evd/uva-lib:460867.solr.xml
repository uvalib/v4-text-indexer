      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. To a Publication of this kind little can with propriety be prefixed: The Reader, if it have one, will peruse it with the Candour of a Gentleman and a Scholar: He will consider whether it may not be of some Use at present in a political View by shewing the Absurdity of modern Innovation; and determine whether, by endeavouring to repress the Rage of conjectural Emendation and Criticism, it may not render a small Service to the Cause of Literature. It is therefore unnecessary to deprecate the Inference, which was at first apprehended from the Disproportion of the Text and Notes, that the former was framed as a Vehicle for the latter; or, supposing it really the Case, to suggest the poetical Structure of the Rolliad and the Botanic Garden as a sufficient Authority. The Writer does not deny that in some of his Observations he has been anticipated (for there is but the same plain Tale to tell) and that others perhaps owe their Novelty to their Insignificance: He neither hints at his own Age nor that of the Poem in Justification of its Juvenilities and Mistakes; but without the Possibility of being read by the past, or the Probability of being remembered by the future, would feel himself happy in the Prospect of being relished by the present, Generation.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. That Prophecies are seldom rightly interpreted till their Completion, must always be less the Fault of the Prophet than of the Commentator; who, being more sparingly gifted with the Spirit of Vaticination, is left to supply the Defect by Conjecture. It was Kuster's Misfortune to publish Aristophanes before the End of the eighteenth Century; and, as he could not with equal Certainty anticipate the mysterious History of that eventful Period, we need not be surprised that he has totally mistaken his Author. Of the NOMINAL Reformers of the Constitution, few have not already, in one Way or another, attained public Notoriety: To discriminate minutely the small Shades of Difference, and to mark the strong Resemblances ?Facies non omnibus una, Nec diversa tamen? Ovid, by which they are distinguished from their Fellow-Citizens and from each other, would be a very idle as well as ill-natured Employment It may be sufficient to remark in general that, if — as the Society for Constitutional Information (Morning Chronicle, May 25, 1792) declares — “Virtues and Vices have been described by a Geographical Chart” with Accuracy, the Morality, like the Politics, of these Visionaries will be found in Utopia.. Let the Authors of the Jockey-Club As those Gentlemen are “not conversant in the Language of Panegyric,” the extorted Praises, which they bestow, wear well: The Line, which couples the Names of Savile and Frederick Montagu, will escape the Contempt and Infamy which overwhelm the rest of that Publication. —with whom we have neither Style, Subject, nor End in common—persecute the Man: For us it is sufficient to expose the Patriot We wish to effect in Politics what has already been so happily accomplished in Poetry: Qui BAVIAD non odit, amet mea Carmina?. Without condescending to mention the wretched Plagiarism, by which (as appears from the Proceedings of political Dramatists) the Impieties of the old Greek Comedian have been revived for modern Exhibition, we may observe, that Innovation is often bold Animus paratus ad periculum, si suâ CUPIDITATE non UTILITATE COMMUNI impellitur, audaciæ potiùs nomen habeat quam fortitudinis. Cic., impertinent, and puerile ??????, ???? ?????? ??? ????? ????? ??????(Hes. ???. ??? ???? I.40) Whatever Euclid (1 Elem. Ax. 9.) may say to the contrary. “?? ??? ??? ??????? ??????????? ?? ???????? ??? ????????? ??? ?????????? ????????????? ?????? ?? ??? ??? ??????? ??????· ?? ?? ?????? ????, ??????????? ???????, ????? ????????????. Herod. [ADOLESCENTEM etiam ERRARE cum excusatione posse (Mat. ad Cic. Ep. 28. lib. II. ad Fam.) is no Apology for Errors which arise from the premature Anticipation of Manhood and a Disavowal of the Age of Venialness.] Fuerunt &amp; alii similis amentiæ cives: Multi enim OMNIS ÆTATIS, OMNIS ORDINIS, UTRIUSQUE SEXUS etiam vocantur in periculum (v.49) &amp; vocabuntur. Plin. Ep. X. 97. These disinterested Cosmopolities generously offer their Service to the Arch Engineer: Tu quoscunque voles in planum effundere MUROS, (v. 46.) His aries actus disperget saxa lacertis; Illa licèt, penitus tolli quam jusseris urbem, ROMA sit? Lucan I. 381., and at the present Moment unseasonable “Omnibus ferè COMITIBUS &amp; DUCIBUS non solum tacitè mussantibus, sed etiam apertè timentibus; contra consilia hominum, contra haruspicum monita ipsi, per semet liberandæ gentis tempus venisse sentiunt.” Paneg. Vet. VIII. II. 4. Qui autum TEMPUS quid postulet non vident, aut PLURA LOQUUNTUR, aut SE OSTENTANT, aut EORUM QUIBUSCUM SUNT rationem non habent, ii INEPTI esse dicuntur.” Cic. “The Purpose you undertake, is dangerous; the Friends you have named, uncertain; the Time itself unsorted; and your whole plot too light for the Counterpoise of so great an Opposition”(Shakes. I. Henry IV. II. 3.) was formerly objected to the Son ofNorthumberland, and may be repeated at present without deservingPercy's Charge of Cowardice and Falsehood. Proximus à tectis ignis defenditur ægrè. OV. Rem. Am. v. 625.. In order to simplify the Dialogue we have introduced only two Speakers, assigning to Chremylus whatever is not appropriate to Plutus: On this Principle the Alterations and Omissions, which the classical Reader will observe to be neither many nor material, are justified. Besides, by thus accumulating many Characters in one, it is implied that Variety of Acting is as frequent in the State as upon the Stage, “Where one Man in his Time plays many Parts:” In both, unless the Popularity of the Farce require Repetition, new Features are put on, new Sentiments uttered, and all the Proteism of Hypocrisy exhibited every Evening; Tears and Triumph alternately occupying the same Face, and disguising the same Heart The Observation of Junius on the Sorrows of a good Man does not render it necessary to expunge this Passage, or disavow the Allusion which it contains: If he had confined his Remark to a great Man, from habitual Deference to his Opinion it would have been omitted.. In translating Chremylus and Plutus by the modern Names of Thomas Paine Of That Man it may be observed, in conformity to the adage, Cœlum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt, that ?? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ????? ????? ????????? Æsch. In compliment to the Virtues of Chremylus it is admitted that the Parallel MIGHT have been more complete. and John Bull we are fully warranted by the corresponding Poverty of the first, and the Opulence of the latter Character. Finally and seriously, let us not by the hasty Adoption of any crude Proposal justify the Charge of national Credulity, nor realize the Character by which we are pronounced to be “Of Schemes enamour'd and of Schemes the Gull:” (Rolliad.) Let us not risque the Possibility of deteriorating our Condition by the rash Application of empirical Nostrums and Elixirs: Ægrescere medendo (Virg. Æn. xii. 46.) was the Misfortune of the Italian who, as a Warning to others, ordered the following Epitaph to be inscribed on his Tomb: ‘I was well: I endeavoured to be better; and here I lie.’ Concerning the personal Satire, into which I have been betrayed in the Translation, I think it sufficient to observe that I am only the Interpreter of Aristophanes: and for the digressive Variety of Correction which prevails throughout the Commentary I can plead the great modern Authority of Wakefield “Vitiata proculdubiò loca venia concedi debet variè tentanti:” Ita Wakefieldus iste, omnium in his (quos vocat) commentariis philologis facilè princeps, de quo quid sentiamus ut uno verbo dicamus; ?Nil fuit unquam Tam dispar sibi? Qui enim lectorem “nunquam sibi de se vel in alios verbum esse aliquid dictum arrogantius” admonuit, suamque mediocritatem “exigui Muris, regium Leonem (si Æsoposides) è plagis extricantis” similitudine illustravit; idem se “difficultatem, cui enodandæ &amp; Vett. &amp; zecentiores incassos conatus impenderunt, commodissimè &amp; nullo etiam negotio solvisse” in eâdem paginâ gloriatur. Nec illi satis suit cæcutientes Commentt. convicisse: “assirmare nullus dubitat, securus etiam lectoris consentientis, secum sæpius Auctores ipsos scribere debuisse, si scripta verè nobilissima voluissent contexere.”.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THOMAS PAINE. JOHN BULL. THOMAS PAINE. Now learn what Advantages, if you take fire, Will straightway attend you:—Tom Paine is no Liar No Doubts have been entertained either of Thomas Paine's Veracity or Loyalty since the Publication of his Book: Though he forgets, in announcing himself as Secretary for Foreign Affairs to Congress in the American War, to mention that he only held this Office under a Committee during TWO Years (after which he resigned)—“Omittance is no Quittance.”! I soon shall a Cure for your Blinking This Metaphor did not escape the Observation of the Scholiast: ??? ???????? ?????? ?? ?????, ?? ?????.—Blinking differs from Blindness, as ???????? (???? ??? ??????? ?????) from ????????. devise, And furnish your Head with regenerate i. e. Eyes anxious to “enjoy the Happiness of seeing the new world regenerate the old.”—Paine's Attachment to this Term, which he seems every where to consider as opposed to Degeneracy, appears from his frequent Use of it. Rights of Man, Part I. pp. 58, 62, 63, 81, 122, &amp;c. 8th Edit. Eyes. JOHN BULL. No, no; whether Blinking or Blindness it be, It shall rest.— T. Paine. “None so blind are, as those that won't see.” Why, you cowardly D?v?l Since Paine has “declared War against the whole Hell of Monarchy,” there can be no Impropriety in translating the Word ????????, which is descriptive of the English as Inhabitants of that Pandæmonium, D?v?ls.! the K??g and his Crown, If you but look up and reclaim what's your own, Are not worth three farthings The Greek Word ????????? expresses the Money paid for parliamentary Attendance: Hence we may infer the true Meaning of the Passage, that the K??g would be in a more wretched Situation than any Member of the Assemblée Nationale..— [The Artifice by which His M?????y is represented as a negative Character, reducing the Value of a Crown to less than Three Farthings, will not escape the Animadversion of the algebraical Reader. Cantab.] J. Bull. Cease, cease to pretend By these impious— T. Paine. Nay prithee have patience, my Friend “The Wicked have only Accomplices; the Designing have Associates; Men of Business have Partners; Politicians form a factious Band; the Bulk of idle Men have Connections, and Princes have Courtiers: but virtuous Men alone have Friends.—Cethegus was Catiline's Accomplice; Mecœnas was Octavius' Courtier: but Cicero was Atticus' Friend.”— (Extr. from Sermons preached in K? Abbey on Is. i. 23.) Sir B. Boothby's Answer however to honest Thomas Paine abounds with Instances of this vulgar Appellation.; And soon you shall own that Supremacy springs From Yourself Vid. Declaration of the sacred Rights of Men and of Citizens, by the National Assembly of France, Art. iii., and that you make and can unmake Kings: For whence does the Royal Authority rise O'er your Jura Divina “These natural, imperscriptible, and unalienable Rights, Liberty, Property, Security, and Resistance of Oppression” (Art. ii.) are violated by Arrest, Excise, (Othello's Occupation's gone!) Existence of Privileged Orders, and Public Prosecution for State Libels. T. P. Above Price must here allude, not to the Honesty of the Proprietors, but to the Value of the Property; for, whatever the Rights may be, Paine himself admits that the right Owner is not (like Pericles) ????????? ?? ??? ???????? ????????., those Rights above Price? From what John abundantly raises, Supplies: To the Civil List Monarchy owes its Support; To the Civil List rises the Incense of Court “Notwithstanding Appearances, there is not any Description of Men that despise Monarchy so much as Courtiers:” &amp;c. Thus Paine EQUALIZES our Courtiers with the wisest Philosophers of Antiquity, who acquiesced in the Observance of Pagan Rites and Ceremonies on the same Principle; and, since Philosophy flourishes at Court, we may truly be said to have attained the Summit of National Felicity; tum demum enim Homines beatissimi agunt, cum aut Philosophi regnent aut Reges philosophentur!: For Places and Pensions the Laity fawn, The Clergy creep, cringe, and crawl forward for Lawn It is hoped that the Reader will not omit to notice the Ingenuity with which “Apt Alliteration's artful Aid” (vid. also v. 52) is applied to support the Latitude of the Paraphrase in this Place: It is scarcely necessary to add, that Paine has a rooted Aversion to Oligarchy, Hierarchy, and “omne quod exit in Archy, præter Anarchy.” ???????? ?? ?????? ??? ????? ?????.. To John these Abuses are owing, and He Might correct them with Ease, if he would.— J. Bull. Can it be? T. Paine. No Off'rings would George from his Subjects receive, Unless in return He had something to give: No Bulses— J. Bull. How, Wretch?— T. Paine. I say, certainly none; Unless you gave him Money and Power, Friend John: And thus, “for Misconduct cashiered,” 'tis plain, You From the ????? of the Original, and Paine's Assertion that, “whilst the Nation is disposed to continue its present trinitarian Form of Government, the three Parts have a national Standing, independent of each other”—any one, who disputed that Writer's Consistency, might be led to suppose that (notwithstanding his Zeal for the Rights of the Nation) he addressed himself to one Part only, into which he seems to absorb the Rights of the other two. “Omninò verò qui reip. præfuturi sunt, duo Platonis præcepta teneant: Unum, ut utilitatem Civium sic tueantur, ut quidquid agant ad eam referant, OBLITI COMMODORUM SUORUM; alterum, ut TOTUM corpus reip. curent, nè, dum PARTEM ALIQUAM tuentur, RELIQUAS deserant.—Qui enim parti civium consulunt, partem negligunt, rem perniciosissimam in civitatem inducunt, Seditionem atque Discordiam.” Cic. de Off. i. 25. might send him to H?n?v?r packing again. But Riches have now alas! absolute Sway, And subjugate England:—'Twas but t'other Day Even I for a pitiful Sum was made Prize: For Money the Journeymen-Shoemakers rise: For Money T?m Ersk?ne exposes his Brass It is not easy, I confess, To baffle such a Plate of BRASS: For, in my Days, I ne'er did hear So impudent a Sophister. C. Cotton's Scoffer scoff'd.: For Money the Treasury governs D?nd?s The Reader will observe the happy Ambiguity of this Passage, which may either mean that Mr. D? governs, or is governed by, the Treasury: It not being however Paine's general Plan —Spargere voces In Vulgum AMBIGUAS, Some People have had the Ill-nature to interpret this ???? ????? to his Disadvantage, as if he wished to reserve to himself the Power of Recantation; and his own Partizans cry out “Dispatch; this Knave's (corr. Slave's) Tongue begins to double.”— Shakesp. 2 Henry VI. 2. 3.—Others, in Consideration of his classical Style, with greater Candour refer the apparent Duplicity to an Imitation of Thucydides, “who has more Deviations than almost any other ancient Writer from what we should apprehend to be regular Syntax, such as the many elliptical, others pleonastic Expressions; Transitions from one Number to another; Substitutions of one Tense for another; Actives for Passives, and Passives for Actives;”—“His very Ambiguities add Lustre to the Composition; inasmuch as EACH of the Senses, which the Words are capable of bearing, are manifestly to the Purpose, and consequently MIGHT have been intended by the Writer.” (Bentham de Thucyd.) The beautiful Anaphora of this Part of the Version, “For Money,” &amp;c. deserves Notice.: For Money, at Durham does B?rr?ngt?n pray In this Couplet there are great Variations: Those, who agree in retaining pray, differ on the Subject of the Petitions; and forgetting the “??? ??????” of the Original, or conceiving it to be implied in the Change of Situation, for which their common Prayers are supposed to be directed to the Throne of Grace, by a bold Emendation read. For Durham at London does B?rr?ngt?n pray; For London his Namesake at Botany-Bay:— Others, without disputing their Piety, observe that the formal Act of Praying is not very fashionable with either of those Classes (whom by a very illiberal Antithesis they denominate active and inactive Citizens) and therefore, in consideration of the close Residence of both at the Places to which they have been respectively transferred, for pray correct stay.; His modester Namesake at Botany-Bay: For Money M?nd?za tans H?mphr?ys' Hide, And C?t with Razors the Freshmen supplied This Piece of University History is well known to J?hnians: A brief Account however is added in usum Tyronum. The Rev. Mr. C?, “a Gentleman by a thousand Pretensions, a Scholar, a Senior Fellow, a Dean, B. D.” with unexampled Generosity made it his Practice for several Years to furnish the newly-admitted Members of his own Society with Razors, and was seldom known to clog the Present with any other Obligation than the trifling Condition of paying Seven Shillings and Sixpence for a Strap! CANTAB.. By Money the Grand Monarque “?????? ??? ?????? ????? ??? ?? ??????? ??????? ???????” (Schol.)—Paine speaks of this Fascination, as of a Thing past, with great Exultation: He seems to treat the Royal Family of France with as much Asperity and Virulence, as if he had been a Custom-house Officer by their Appointment, and owed his Subsistence to their Favour: This Vox &amp; præterea nihil, ? qui nec reticere loquenti, Nec prior ipse loqui potuit— Ovid. (Vid. Pref. to Rights of Man, II. p. vii.) under the Pretext of answering Mr. Burke, misrepresents and traduces all that he has said—“Nihil tamen illum magis penetravit quam studia Burkii accensa in Antoniettam; cum decus Patriæ, SOROREM CÆSARUM, antiquitatis specimen appellaret, versusque ad cœlum ac Deos integram illi subolem ac superstitem iniquorum precaretur.” (Tac. Ann. iii. 4.)—To him the “bon jour” of M. Bailly, “Dies modò per silentium vastus, modò ploratibus inquies: plena Urbis Itinera, conlucentes per Campum Martis faces: Miles cum armis, sine insignibus Magistratus, Populus per tribus— clamitantes promptius apertiusque quàm ut meminisse IMPERITANTIUM crederes,” (Tac. ibid.) are congenial and grateful— “He likes this Rocking of the Battlements: —“Horrors are not unpleasing to him; “They suit the gloomy Habit of his Soul.” (Revenge.) We are presented by Sir B. Boothby with very different Reflections: —“In the Contemplation of the despoiled and desolated Grandeur (of Versailles), its silent Halls and solitary State-Rooms, its dried-up Fountains and mouldering Sculptures, the Joys of Freedom will be suspended and absorbed in sad Reflections on the Vanity of human Greatness, and the Instability of human Institutions. —The Silence will be disturbed by Sounds of Triumph that are no longer heard, and the Solitude peopled with the brilliant Forms that shall no more glide over its polished Floors.”, à la distance, Enchanted and HUMBLED the People of France: For Money the National Synods assemble: J. Bull. And by Money our Armaments made mad Some read lewd (supposing mad to have crept in, by the Hallucination of the Transcriber, from the Repetition of the preceding Word made) as an Epithet more appropriate to this Mesalina of the North, and, without any personal Reference to Mr. W?h, quote Tacitus in Confirmation of this Conjecture—“Modestâ juventâ sed corpore insigni acciti ultrò, noctemque intra umam proturbati; paribus LASCIVIIS ad cupidinem &amp; fastidia.” (Ann. xi. 36.) Others however, observing the few Instances of this Oscitancy, and the great Number and Variety of Figures occurring in the Original and Version, by a happier Correction read Maid ??? ??????????. With less Acuteness the same Critics reject both the Emendations of v. 34. in favour of prey, which they endeavour to justify by the same Figure. Kate tremble. T. Paine. Polemical Politics own it their Sword Not such an one as that made use of by Alexander the Great to cut the Gordian Knot; but of that more peaceable and safer Kind which may be girt round an Ass (A. D. 1770–1783), and by which Philip disentangled the Intricacies of the Athenian Coalition and the Federation of Greece. Money has long been considered as the most effective Agent in Wars of all Kinds—the Nervi Bellorum, ?? ?? ??????? ? ??????? ??????? —and its decisive Influence is proverbially notorious; ???????? ???????? ????? ??? ????? ?????????., And Victory follows the Treasury Lord The Variation, “And Victory SITS ON the Treasury Board,” seems at first Sight preferable, as implying a Vindication of those Characters, who stand aloof from the Weakness of personal Attachment and with an unvarying Consistency of Conduct adhere to the Vicarage of Bray: But it is rejected, as the other Reading admits the same Interpretation, on account of the Misapplication of the Metaphor included in ????????? ??.. J. Bull. In Compassion to the Lais, Timotheus, &amp;c. of modern Times, the Parody of the next eight Lines (from v. 161–168 of the Original) is omitted. You seem to speak plausibly “If I were to precognize ‘Rights of Man’ in a few Words, I should say that it is the Work of a shrewd Empiric, written in a Kind of specious Jargon, well enough calculated to impose upon the Vulgar, but containing nothing new, or ingenious, or deserving of serious Attention. The great Secret of Quackery is to address the Passions of Men while they are made to believe that their Understandings only are engaged; to work upon their Hopes and Fears under the Mask of Reason. Religion and Politics and Medicine are abundant and never-failing Sources of empirical Frauds.—When a Mountebank comes to the Door of a sensible, discreet Housekeeper, he will say to him, ‘Friend, go about your Business, unless you have a Mind to be taken up as a Vagrant, and whipped and passed to your Parish: I and my Family are, thank God, in good Health; and, when any of us are ill, we will use such known and tried Remedies as the Physician shall prescribe. In the mean Time, take away your impudent lying Bills and Advertisements, designed to impose upon our Simplicity in an Art of which we are wholly ignorant, that you may pick our Pockets: You shall not fill our Heads with vain Fears and idle Apprehensions, that you may vend your poisonous Drugs, which, if we were Fools enough to take, might occasion real Maladies.” Sir B.

That no one believes; But when I'm assail'd by Republican Thieves (Whom extravagant Prospects of Plunder allure) In a good Constitution The Words Republican and Constitution, in the Version, are better adapted to the declaratory Lines which attend them, than to the individual and private Character allotted to John Bull in this Dialogue. “A Constitution, as the Word implies, means any Thing constituted of Parts making a Whole; as we say the Constitution of a Borough, or the Constitution of a Horse: When applied particularly to Government, it means the Aggregate of the Laws and Institutions and Establishments, whether they have ever been collected in a WRITTEN Code or not, by which the Country or Nation referred to is governed.” Sir B. Boothby.— By way of Illustration he adds, “Descartes says, ‘I think, therefore I am:’ England is governed by known and established Law, therefore it has a Constitution.” they find me secure: Then my Care is call'd Cowardice— T.

Bull. Such sneaking Associates I ne'er can endure: T. Paine. The R?gues will be honest with Money and Pow'r Of which Articles Royalty, v. 25. is to be divested.—The Machinations, by which the Monarchy of France has been disrobed of its Splendour, began in the personal Ridicule of Majesty. The Crimen impudicitiæ Adulterque were fabricated against the Queen, and of her Consort it was scandalously said by those, who are not at present ashamed of acting under the Auspices of the Royal Puppet, that “Umbraculis Hortorum abditus ut IGNAVA ANIMALIA, quibus si cibum suggeras jacent torpentque, præterita, instantia, futura pari oblivione dimiserat:” With greater Justice it might be pronounced of his Conduct in the Beginning of the present Disturbances that “Remedia malorum potius quàm mala differebat.”—MONITI CAVEANT!.

Accomplices some one call in (Who wretchedly live upon P??ching and G?n) That by EQUAL Partition This Distribution of Property many are anxious to introduce: (vid. v. 50.)—Of one of them Quem tulit ad SCENAM ventoso Gloria curru the Reader will accept the following accurate Character from Tacitus: “Dux THEATRALIUM OPERARUM, procax linguâ, &amp; miscere cœtus HISTRIONALI studio doctus;” (Ann. 1. 16.) Falsò autem LIBERTATIS vocabulum obtenditur ab iis, qui privatim degeneres, in publicum exitiosi, nihil spei nisi per DISCORDIAS habent.” (Ib. v. 17.) Of his dramatic Talents Fame does not permit us to doubt—Ah! si sic omnia—Fortunate had it been for his Character if he had confined his Ambition to the Plausus sui Theatri, without encountering the Angry Boy; to whom we may honestly apply Cicero's Character of Lucullus— “Incredibilis quædam Ingenii magnitudo non desideravit indocilem usûs disciplinam.” “Put no Trust,” says Rousseau, “in those Cosmopolites, who seek for Duties at a Distance, while they neglect such as are their immediate Concern: a Philosopher of this Kind loves the Tartars by way of Excuse for hating his Neighbours.” the Feast they may share: And some Member take in our REFORM'D Bill of Fare.
