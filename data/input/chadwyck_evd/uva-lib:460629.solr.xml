      <field name="fulltext">ACT I The Election Scene.âThe outskirts of Pavia. A grassy knoll rises near the centre of the stage, and is crowned by a moss-grown rock which has been rudely squared. At the back and left and right are clumps of old chestnut trees in flower. The walled city is behind. It is towards noon in the beginning of summer. Lord, ladies, citizens, etc., pass and repass among the trees. It is evident that a crowd is gathering. Philadelphus and Junipert enter right and left. Philadelphus is bearded; his hair, unkempt. He is stout, ruddy, and cheerful-looking; dressed in a ragged brown robe and wearing sandals; he carries a stout stick. Junipert is slender, with long dark hair. He is dressed in rusty black, and carries tablets in which he is writing. Phil. (intercepting Junipert). Have I imagined it, or did we meet? You prey on faded wardrobes; and the rust Of ancient armour is your condiment: A vamper of archaic vocables, Extinct mythologies, illicit lore, And general obsolescence: poet still, Courageously, and in contempt of time. Juni. And I know you, sir: a philosopher; One that has given in to fate; that bows The knee to the inevitable; ass Of the world's old burden, thought; and turnspit, wheeled To reason in a circle endlessly. Phil. Believe it, since you must. I deem myself Intelligence essential.âWhat is that? Juni. The coronation-stone of Lombardy, As every crow can tell. Phil. And do you know That here, within the hour, the Lombards meet To choose their king? Juni. Of course I know! Phil. And waste Your brain on longs and shorts? You cannot know! Think: to be king!âAt some time in his life The aim of every mother's son. Juni. Not so! The poet ranks above the highest king. Phil. Believe it, if you can. But I profess Philosophyâthe cult of good and ill. Being, as I am, a representative, A packed compendium, of humanity, My pulses, nervesâmy whole assembly aches With antepastoral jealousy of him Who shall be crowned to-day; and I am come To breed, in the locality and air Of this event, a project I have hatched, Whereby to seize a notoriety That shall eclipse the firmament of fame About to open on a royal head Unknown as yet. Juni. Foolish philosopher! Look: I indite a poem as I walk. Behold erasure and a threshing-floor; A strife, a granary, a monument! Phil. But yours is the appeal to aftertimes. Who ever heard posterity applaud! No; I must have my name dance on the tongues Of all men in my hearing. [compels Junipert to sit on the coronation-stone.] Aribert, King of the Lombards, died a week ago, And sepulchred in royal state he lies. On the same day died Martin Rustyblade, The headsman, and was shovelled into earthâ A furtive burial. Now, you are kingâ But think so!âcrowned, enthroned. I, with my staff And sandalsâ Juni. Look who comes! [rises and is about to go out.] Phil. Old Thrasimund! No room for us where he perambulates! This wayâwith me. I must rehearse the part I'll act at the election of the king. [They go out together.] Enter from the right Thrasimund, Almeric, Adalbert, Ludolf, and Ulric. Thrasimund is an old man with grey beard and scanty locks well trimmed. He enters quickly in advance of the others, looking about on all sides. Adalbert and Ludolf are between fifty and sixty years of age: officials. Almeric and Ulric are young and handsome. Thra. Where is my wife? [goes out testily.] Adal. He should, indeed, be told. His dotage undermines his old renown: Our party suffers. Shall we bluntly say, âNow, Thrasimund, your wife the world knows well Is deep in love with Urban. She has sent Apparent missives; she has flung him looks. True, Urban's passion for Saturnia Absorbs him wholly; but at twenty-five Love is a rambler. Heed it, Thrasimund.â Lud. Explicit. And commend his own repute To his best care; for when an oldster weds A lusty girl he pawns his character, And seldom is the shabby pledge redeemed Even by the most heroic wariness. Alm. And be derided for your wittolhood! Best leave December and the fateful May To thaw and freeze and make a season out With weather of their own. Ulr. The climate there Is treacherous, I've heard, for come-betweens.â Have you seen Lucian yet?âAh, Hildebrand! Enter Hildebrand from the left. He is about sixty years old, but looks younger. His face is powerful and eager, its original frankness obscured by craft, long thwarted but still alive and hopeful. Hild. (indignantly as he enters). Men are more obstinate, more volatile, More rash, more pusillanimous than flies! Alm. Some men, my lord. Hild. Six that I know of, sir! But where is Lucian? Alm. None of us can tell. Hild. He left his house before the dawn, they say. Where can he be? And Thrasimund? [Almeric points out Thrasimund.] Antique Afflictive amorist, with honeyed wine That only youth can carry, love I mean, Unnerved and sodden! [Re-enter Thrasimund with Violante. Violante is about twenty-five years old; a harebrained, voluptuous woman.] All our skill that joined Inveterate enmitiesâI greet you, madamâ Our drudgery in herding fools, our high Elaborate hopes are squandered and engulfed As in a quicksand, never to be found. Viol. How! Have the waverers abandoned you? Hild. Not one! Not one! But six false lords we deemed Securely rooted in our interests. Viol. Six! You lose the election, then. What are their names? Hild. Perish their names! Viol. How were the traitors bribed? Hild. By Urban's subtle charm, by that alone. Viol. He has I know not what of careless grace; A look, a toneâ Thra. Effeminate, I say! Unstable, wanton, glib, and arrogant. He jests at worth and age; andâ Hild. What you say Is certain. Lucian is the nobler man; But our emergency could overlook In him his rival's fortune that converts Six enemies at supper with a word. Lud. Is there no scheme to countervail this blow? Enter from the left a Messenger running at a measured pace. Thra. One never knows. Hild. What messenger is that? Quick, bring him here! He may have news for us. [Almeric and Ulric follow the Messenger and return with him.] Viol. Or for your enemies. Thra. For us then still; And more significantly too. Hild. (to the Messenger). The letter. Mess. (affecting stupidity). O sir, my lord, your excellencyâpray, Which is the way to Pavia, here or there? Hild. The letter that you carry! Mess. Thanks, my lord! [tries to escape.] Hild. Search him! [The Messenger is searched, and a letter taken from the breast of his tunic.] Thra. (seizing the letter). For Urban! Hild. Who commissioned you? Mess. What have they found? Who says I stole it? Shame! Hild. A rogue that serves his master as he can! Thra. From the Duke of Garda! [reading.] âIt is rumoured hereââhe writes from RavennaââIt is rumoured here that the more potent voice of the nobility will support Lucian. I and my company are at your disposal. The Exarch of Ravenna offers aid. Be king by right of conquest. Lombardy remains a mere scaffold, an untied faggot until the monarchy becomes absolute.â Hild. This to Urban from the Duke of Garda, known A base self-seeker, who would set the world At war, so he might gather odds and ends Dropped in the scuffle! Thra. If we publish now That Urban is in league with one endured Only by those who need him; if we taint His name with treason! Viol. But we know not that; Because had Lucian stood in Urban's shoes He might have had this letter. Thra. Gently urged! You have the grace so to suppose; but men Will think the worstâand very vilely too, As I intend. This letter, closed again, Must be delivered in the public sight, While I harangue the assembly. Bitterly I shall accuse him: âLet the letter speak!â Shall be my cry. When this is read aloud The six recalcitrants are ours once more! Hild. If he decline to have his letter read? Thra. He stands confessed a traitor obvious! Better for us if he decline to read! I shall so press it home that either way He loses the election. I am deft At these contrivances. A little heat Will mend this seal, and shiver Urban's luck.â Ludolf, your house is scarce a stone's throw hence. [Thrasimund, Violante, Adalbert, Ludolf, and the Messenger go out] Alm. (looking to the right). They have left the city. The Bishop brings the crown. Hild. Lucian is with the Bishop, I suppose. Alm. He should have been with us. Hild. Where is my daughter? I see her, now. Ask her to come to me. Alm. She comes unbidden.âLet us meet them, Ulric. [Almeric and Ulric go out together.] Enter Osmunda. She is in her twentieth year, but looks younger; is tall and fair. Her face, in repose almost expressionless, becomes exceedingly mobile when her attention is aroused. Osm. I felt you wished me. Hild. You have understoodâ I think, Osmunda, you have understood My purposes. [Osmunda shrinks from her father.] You would be spared. I, too, Have spared myself and weakly left unsaid, When every omen beckoned me to speak, This that I stammer now, though time and place Are most unapt. Not less than sacrilege It seems to pry into my daughter's heart. Now most I wish your mother were alive!â Has Lucian spoken yet? Osm. Of love, sir? No. Hild. He loves you? Osm. Sir, I cannot truly tell. Hild. But you love him? Osm. I love you and this land The Lombards won from the false Roman. Hild. Yes; The Lombards first! I taught you that; and great It is to throne the nation we are of Above ourselves, our lovers, kindred, friends. But Lucian after Lombardy?âMy thought Is stamped upon the realm. King Aribert, A brave and loyal nature, was to me A sceptre and a sword wherewith I ruled The Lombards, carved the figure of the state, And lopped its enemies. The name of King I cannot compass: I am hated, feared, As all just rulers are. Wherefore, because I deem myself the man most competent To guide the destinies of Lombardy, I would make Lucian king, a youth I love, And sometimes have instructed in my craft, My government and scheme of policy. Although to neither have I told my hope, (with hesitation) Still, he and youâ Osm. He has not spoken yet! Hild. That may not be amiss. I will believe He loves you; and you him: but Lombardy O'ermasters every passion in your heart. Were Urban to be chosenâ [Osmunda shrinks further away from her father.] If chance, that trips The heels of purposes no skill can throw, Should make this Urban king, could youâ The thing being possibleâgive him your hand? Osm. Give him my hand! Urban my hand!âHe asked Me once to marry himâ Hild. (eagerly). Did he, indeed! He loves you, then? Osm. Oh no! I was, he said, The sweetest lady in the land; and so He must have me to wife. Insolent fop! (impulsively) Oh, father, Lucian, since by heart awoke, Is king of me! Hild. (in a tone of menace, but quietly). If the great future I have prepared for Lombardy requires My daughter to be queenâand should the lot Be cast for Urban, chief of those that thwart My policy, who else can save the state?â She would not stand upon a girlish plea Of personal affection. Osm. Save the state By marrying Urban! Hild. Just by marrying Urban. Osm. (in a low voice). The lover of Saturnia! Hild. As Urban's wife My daughter could impart my influence, Turn enmity to friendship, reinstall The fulness of my power, should I be thrown From my high office. (pleasantly) But this is to forecast A most unlikely order of events. Our Lucianâlet us meet himâshall be king; Osmunda, queen; and I, old drudge of state, Shall bear the blame of all their tyranny. Osm. I pray you let me stay here by myself, Until they come. I would consider this. Hild. Consider most the weal of Lombardy. [goes out.] Osm. The weal of Lombardy!âTo be the wife Of Urban; him, whose presence, whose approach Fills me with dark misgiving; whom I hateâ If I hate any one. For Lombardy, And for my father, could I bear such woe? Enter Lucian. He is about thirty years old; handsome and in free moments graceful; but bashful and awkward as a rule. He is in deep thought on his entrance. Osm. Lucian! Luc. Osmunda! Osm. Why alone, my lord? Luc. To think! to think! I have been abroad since morn. Am I the man who should be king? The doubt That hampers me admonishes my soul Of most unkingly weakness. In myself Unchosen and uncrowned, am I the king? Osm. (with a certain degree of abandonment, rebelling at her father's harsh control.) You are the king; and all your shifting doubts Are jewels in your native diadem Of perfect truth. Luc. That is your inmost thought? Osm. The deep conviction of my very soul. Luc. It helps! it helps! And yet I need some sign, Else at the fateful moment when the lords Acclaim my coronation, I may cry, âI am unworthy, for I doubt myself,â And fling the crown away. Osm. A sign, my lord? Luc. From you. I have another torturing doubt Deeper than my vocation to the throne. Osm. And I, my lord, can set that doubt at rest? Luc. You only. Osm. It is dead and buried, then! Luc. Buried and festering here! If you can find This wound, probe it, and draw the ragged shaft That rankles in my heart; it shall denote That my unkingly doubt is fantasy. Osm. You ask a miracle. Luc. Can love perform No wonders now? Osm. (faintly). Love! Luc. Speak! Uproot my doubt! Osm. Oh, my lord Lucian! but I love you well. Luc. (triumphantly). Then am I king! For since you love me well It cannot beâit cannot surely be That I am all unworthy of your love; And having that shall I demur and dread To wear the lesser glory of the crown? Osm. Fear not the highest destiny! Luc. For you! It is for you! How could I offer her Who gives me love less than the name of queen? Osm. (suddenly recollecting her father's suggestion). If you should not be chosen king! Luc. Not king? But it is sure! They never can elect The ruffling Urban, petulant and vain, The minion of his pleasures. Hildebrand, Your father, knows that I am to be king. Osm. If Urban should be chosen! Luc. Never at all Have I imagined that! It must not be! I could not marry you, I could not live Were UrbanâUrban!âto be chosen king! Osm. Behold I have revealed you to yourself! Before your proud ideal you are in doubt; Against your rival, strong and resolute. Luc. Against a thousand rivals! [takes Osmunda's hand.] Osm. But, my lord, My father and your friends are seeking you. Luc. I had to be alone. And it was well Because of this encounter. Osm. Wellâand ill. [Lucian releases her hand and stares at her blankly. Osmunda offers him a pomander that hangs at her girdle.] What is thatâdo you know? Luc. (handling the pomander.) Why, what it seems, An exquisite pomander. Osm. It is besides A desperate comfort; poison, smelling sweet As violets rooted by a sepulchre. [Lucian takes her hand with great solicitude.] Ask nothing of meânothing. [goes out quickly.] Luc. Still the doubt! [goes out after Osmunda.] Re-enter Thrasimund, Adalbert, Ludolf, Violante, and the Messenger. Thra. Yes; but it must be opportunely done. [to the Messenger.] Your post is near my lady. On the spur Of her mute prompting this deliver straight. [gives the letter to the Messenger.] Mess. To whom shall I deliver it? Thra. To one That least expects it. Lud. Do you leave him here? Alone? Viol. The man is human at the best. His patience and obedience need some help. Let me remain while you rejoin your friends. Thra. Sweetheart, it shall be so.âFootman, attend! [Violante sits on the coronation-stone, and the Messenger stands by her side.] Is she not infinitely adorable, Immaculately beautiful and chaste? [Thrasimund, Adalbert, and Ludolf go out. Viol. Your mask of dulness fits you badly. Quick, Your hand! It's broad, but scarcely deep enough. Join them and make a chalice. Pocket that. [fills his hands with money.] Give me the letter. [The Messenger gives her the letter, which she tears into small pieces and scatters in a clump of chestnuts.] Now indeed, you look A genuine fool! [takes a letter from her bosom and hands it to the Messenger.] When the election's over Give Urban this. Mess. Is it not hazardous? Viol. Most hazardous; we trip the shifting sand Between the devil and the deep sea. Hang About my skirts. Be docile and you're made. Enter the Rabble, crying âLucian! Lucian!â After them Citizens, including Philadelphus and Junipert. Then Lords and Ladies, preceding Lucian, Osmunda, Hildebrand, Thrasimund, Violante, Ludolf, Adalbert, Almeric, and Ulric, who stand on the left. These are followed by a body of Soldiers, who march the Citizens and the Rabble to the back of the stage and guard a passage from the right to the coronation-stone. Violante and the Messenger have come down to the front on the right. Hild. (whispering). The matter of the letter, Thrasimund? Thra. (whispering). Placed in the safest hands in Lombardy. My wife shall at a passage in my speech, Discharge the courier with his tell-tale news At Urban's head. Hild. (to himself). Old fool! His wife? His bosom-enemy! I'll set a watch. [whispers to Ludolf, who crosses and stands beside Messenger.] Enter the Bishop of Pavia, attended by Acolytes swinging censers, a Priest carrying the Iron Crown on a cushion, and Servants with a cloth of gold which they fling over the coronation-stone. The Bishop stands on the right of the knoll, Acolytes on one hand, and the Priest on the other. Adal. (looking out right). He loiters, talking idly with his friends. Lud. His fate is on the anvil and he laughs. Thra. Begin, my lord, the business of the hour. Bish. Although this Urban be unmannerly, Our conduct must become us. Enter Urban, with Pasqual on his right; a little behind him five other Lords and a Falconer with hawks. Urban is about twenty-five, with yellow curls hanging to his shoulders. His moustache is trimmed to give him a juvenile appearance. He has a hooded hawk on his gauntletted left hand, and carries a hawking-pole in his right. He is dressed in a richly ornamented hawking-costume. His presence makes the air electric; all are wondering what he will do, what he will say. Pasqual is about Urban's age; dark-haired; devoted to Urban. On the entrance of Urban, Lucian shrinks behind Osmunda. Urb. Lucian! Whereâ Where is my princely rival? [Osmunda pushes Lucian forward. Urban throws his hawking-pole to Pasqual, and crossing quickly to Lucian takes his hand.] Good-day, my lord! (radiantly) Whether I win or lose, my pride is throned As high as my desire because of this:â I was found worthy to contest with you The iron crown of Lombardy. Luc. (stiffly). My lord, I thank you. Urb. I have often thought it strange We meet so seldom. Luc. I frequent the past More than the dazzling tumult of the hour. Urb. Where silence reigns and thought may wander free! I love the past; but there no deeds are done; And I would act. Deeds, deeds, my lord! Luc. And thoughts. Urb. It is a deed to think as I intend. To dream, to mope in cloisters with a book; To argue with one's selfâan easy fight, The practised dexter brandishing a sword Against the awkward dagger of the left . . . [interrupting himself, as his gesture brings his hawk to mind.] My merlin with the russet-velvet wing, The birds of heaven shall fall beneath your feet! . . . I say, to think in solitude at home Is not to think but to be lunatic. Pale-hearted is the thought that dare not be As kindred to its deed as sound and light When heaven is masked and wields the thunderbolt. Luc. One must command the world to think that way. Urb. Assuredly; scarce one man in an age Can think his meaning out. Luc. You force the word. Urb. Words are my toys. I swear all other thought Than that which works in things, not signs; and moves Abreast with action to the happy close Is like a headless spear, a wooden sword. Bish. My lord Urban, you have delayed the act For which we are met; further, it fits you ill Upon this solemn business to appear With hawk on fist. Thra. A merlin too, we noteâ The imperial bird. Urb. (to Thrasimund). It is your rightful wish That I should lose the election; if I do, Would you withhold such pure oblivion Of my defeat as may immediately Befriend me, when I watch my merlin, belled With Milan silver, climb the tingling air? [gives his hawk to the Falconer.] Hild. My lord, your gaiety would gild the world Were daylight done. Our Lucian here is set To graver music; not a wink of sleep Had he all night, revolving desperately The issue of to-day. Urb. And did I rest? A watch devout of sleepless nightingales Attended in my garden where I paced Till morn; above the meadows now the larks Enwreath the sky with sound; but neither night Nor day, nor nature's timely melody Could tune my mind to any constant mood. Here only, at the moment of my fate, My soul at last reposes, and I know, Howe'er it ends, I shall be satisfied.â Come, my lord bishop, let the vote be cast. Thra. One word. You see, and many, I believe, Proscribe in silence Urban's arrogance; Though some, corrupted by the spell, so-called, Of his reputed charm, excuse, nay praise, That wanton style, which in another, all Would censure and chastise. Beneath this trick, This brilliant ambush of indifferent pride, There lurks, believe me, a tyrannic soul. Lud. (whispering). Now is your time. Mess. Not yet! Viol. (whispering). Leave him alone! Voices. Silence there; silence! Thra. It is known, at last, That Urban is in league with traitors. Lud. Back! [thrusting the Messenger forward while seeming to restrain him.] Come back! He will not be withheld. He bears, He says, post-haste, a letter from Ravenna. Thra. A letter from Ravenna, that forcing-house Of enmity to Lombard rule! For whom? Lud. For Urban. Adal. In the very nick of time! Urb. The devil's children have the devil's luck. Give me this letter that arrives so pat. [takes the letter.] I know the writing. [fans himself with the letter.âViolante looks imploringly at Urban, but his glance never turns her way.] Thra. It is hot, my lord; And will be warmer, presently, for you.â Nobles and men of Lombardy, our king Has ever been the servant of his people, Obedient to the laws. If you elect This traitorous lord, you choose a malcontent Whose aim will be to overturn the state, To rule as despot and enslave us all. Bish. Your accusation would be weightier Did you advance some proof. Thra. What further proof Is needed than the message now received? Urb. This is a private letterâfrom a friend. Thra. Will you permit the letter to be read? Urb. If I refuse? Thra. Your treason is confessed. Voices. The letter! Read the letter! Urb. Very well. But first, be warned. A lifelong memory Of what you now demand will gnaw your heart With exquisite regret. Thra. My heart? For shame! A paltry ruse to turn the tables! Read! If that is not of treasonable mark, Some outlaw's message, I'll unpack my brains To feed a housewife's poultry. Me, regret! Urb. (with a glance of compassion). The seal is yet unbroken. Thra. Break it now. Bish. Give me the letter. Should the charge be true, Nothing were simpler than to read a note Of invitation or a friendly wish, And leave our doubt silenced but unresolved. [Violante with a smothered exclamation hurries out.] Thra. A pregnant counsel! Urb. Read it then, my lord. [gives the letter to the Bishop.] A moment! Do you fear to find my name Blighted for ever? Bish. No; some strange abuse Is here at work. Thra. Some strange abuse, indeed! Urb. It may be so. Bish. (having opened the letter and glanced at the signature). I am sorry, Thrasimund. This comes from Violante. [All look towards the place where Violante had been standing, and many nod their heads knowingly.] Thra. What! Voices. Read! Read! Bish. (reading.) âMay it please your majesty. My hope had made you king already, my most dear Urban, and if now you wear the crown you owe it to me. This letter is in place of one which, by my husband's arrangement, should have lost you the kingship. Oh, my lord, your constant scorn maddens me! For this service, what reward?âViolante.â Thra. Give it me! [The Bishop gives Thrasimund the letter.] How is this? Where is she? Where! Alm. Gone home to hang herself! Thra. I can explainâ Ulr. Explain a byeword old as time itself! Upon your face the truth is wrinkled deep. Thra. I mean to sayâ Hild. Mean silence, and go home. [Thrasimund, becoming more and more confused, half stumbles, and is half pushed from one to the other of several lords, who address him in turn.] 1st L. Some men, if marriages be made in heaven, Have few friends there. 2nd L. This was a vulgar trick! 3rd L. The fox that hastens forth to buy a knife Lands often in the furrier's. 4th L. You trudge home shorn. 5th L. And stuck with proverbs like an archer's mark. [Thrasimund is about to fall, when Urban supports him and leads him out, returning immediately.] Voice (from the rabble). Hey! Keep your brains for your own poultry-yard! 6th L. I vote for Urban now! Other Lords. And I, and I. Bish. The memory of this disgrace must fret High hearts the longest; but the tongues of all Who love the state will leave the thing untouched Henceforth for ever, garbage for gossipers.â By our old wont we are assembled here To choose a king. Two names are offered you: Urban and Lucian. I commend them both. Who vote for Lucian? Lucian's Party (with drawn swords in air). Lucian! [Lucian half draws his sword and drives it back into the scabbard disdainfully.] Bish. Now, for Urban? Urban's Party (an evident majority, with drawn swords in air). Urban! [Urban, having no sword, takes one before he has time to resheath it from a supporter of Lucian's, and is the first to vote for himself.] Lords, Ladies, Citizens. Urban! Rabble. Urban, king of the Lombards! Bish. (to Lucian). Do you demand a poll? It is your right. Luc. I thank you. It is needless now, my lord. (stiffly, nerving himself to say it; to Urban.) The crown is yours, I am your majesty's: Command my loyalty. Urb. Oh, noble Lombard! To-night, I hope to welcome you, my guest, Most honoured, most illustrious. Luc. Pardon me; I wish to be alone. [moves towards Osmunda, then turns away and goes out hastily. Osmunda, deeply distressed, is about to follow Lucian, but Hildebrand withholds her.] Phil. (bursts through the guard and falls at Urban's feet). A boon! a boon! Urb. What suitor have we here? Phil. Your majesty, I am, so please you, a philosopher. Urb. And what is that? Phil. A thinker, who adopts His proper attitude. Urb. Adopt another. Rise and define yourself. Phil. (rises). I do not ask That men should see themselves as others do. I am concerned that I myself should see My fellow-creatures as they see themselves. Urb. A most magnanimous philosophy! How do you like it, Pasqual? Pasq. I should hold Such conscious magnanimity suspect. Urb. A thing put on? Good; magnanimity Can never be acquired, and nothing shows More feeble than its affectation. Phil. True; Yet hear me out. Magnanimous I am; But like the meanest and the greatest here, Envy of your great fortune sears my soul. Urb. Envy of me! Phil. As long as life shall last! Nothing to me is of significance Between your station and nonentity. And since I cannot be the king alone Upon the apex of the pyramid, Make me the headsman to frequent its base, Expelled and banned, a being less than nought. Urb. The headsman? Phil. Yes. My predecessor died Upon the same day as king Aribert. Urb. How does this chime with your professed good-will? Phil. In tune! A headsman there must always beâ Urb. Must there indeed! I am the foe of âmustâ In things that men control. If need arise I will appoint a headsman, not before. Phil. Three men await the axe, your majesty. Urb. They shall be pardoned, then, to grace this day. Begone, sir; you have dimmed a burnished hour, And like a death's-head o'er my shoulder peered, Forecasting woe. [Philadelphus is thrust back among the Rabble.] Phil. I shall be headsmen yet! Juni. You feel that? In my ears a singing keeps, âYou, too, shall serve the great ones of the earth.â Bish. (laying his hand on the crown). My lord, and king electâ Urb. Not yet. (to Hildebrand.) I wish, Before the hallowed crown of Lombardy Convinces me of kingship, to atone The factions, that the state itself And my dominion may be based and reared On one united heart and will. Hild. I moved The world against you, jealous of my right As a free Lombard; but since fate decides For you, I bury in the past all doubt, Antipathy, and malice, there to die And moulder into dustâif you prove true To Lombardy, and the impartial rule Of law-abiding kings. Urb. This for yourself, And those who follow you of every rank? Hild. I undertake for all. Lords and Citizens. For all! Rabble. For all! Urb. And now, my lord, I beg your daughter's hand As sign and seal of this new amity. [All are well pleased.] Pasq. A perfect match! It would delight the world. Hild. Proudly I welcome it! But she is here, A free maid, and must answer for herself. [fixing his eyes on Osmunda, he leads her to Urban.] Urb. (loftily, but sweetly enough). Will you be mine, most high, most beautiful? In sight of men, beneath the eye of heaven, As monarchs may, I woo; but for myself, Lady, I woo you not; nor yet as king: I woo you in the name of Lombardy, Because you are most worthy to be queen. Osm. (looks to her father, whose eyes are fixed on her; then quickly to Urban). Not worthyâoh, not worthy! but in the name Of Lombardy, and to unite the state, I think, my lord, I could bestow my hand. [Urban kisses Osmunda's right hand; Hildebrand presses her left. Osmunda sighs heavily, and cannot conceal her distress.] Voice (high and clear at the back of the stage). Saturnia! Voice (deep and strong at the back). Ay, ay! Saturnia! Urb. (faintly). Who speaks? Voice (like an echo). Saturnia! [Osmunda shrinks away. Hildebrand is much dismayed. Urban looks with menacing glance at various lords whom he seems to suspect.] Bish. These airy calls Assail your conscience, king elect. The world Has watched your amour with the Roman slave Who rules your heart; the market-haunters jest Of Urban and Saturnia; lovers brood And hatch a legend for them. Pride of life, Most rank, most salient, speak to me of power And a great nature idling by the way. Is it not so? The king will leave behind The sins of manhood? Urb. Else were he no king! Of manhood's sins and of its virtues too, Outworn apparel, kings divest themselves. Saturnia, I renounce. Hild. A high resolve! Adal. And sudden! Pasq. Not so sudden, as I know. Three days ago, expecting to be king, He left Saturnia. Voice. Saturnia! [Urban having doffed his hat, has approached the Bishop for the coronation, but starts and turns at the word âSaturnia.â Many voices join in the cry; it is first taken up by the Rabble, then by the Lords and Citizens.] Enter Saturnia. She is in her twenty-first year, but looks older. Her face is full; the features large, and in repose somewhat harsh; the eyes are dark grey, gentle in expression, and with the depth and significance of youth and passion. Her dark brown hair hangs to her waist. Her voice is deep and sweet. She wears a white robe girt with a belt of gold. Saturnia goes at once to Urban, heeding none of the bystanders, who are intensely interested. Sat. The terror of the night has driven me here. Urb. You should have stayed at home. Sat. At home! Why did my home forsake me silently For three long suns and moons? Urb. You shall be told; But leave me now. Sat. I dare not leave you now, Lest I should never see your face again. Urb. Some idle fancy has distressed you. Sat. No! Three times I dreamt you were about to die. A frightened woman clung to you, her arms Entwined in such a lover's knot as this. [clasps her arms about Urban's neck.] She cried out, âMercy! mercy!â [withdraws her arms from Urban's neck.] Desperately I strained my sight, and watched for her to turn; But still her countenance was hidden. Urb. Pooh! A nursery tale of second-sight! [turns from Saturnia to Pasqual.] Sat. (laying her hand on Urban's arm). Attend! [Urban faces Saturnia.] Trailing his burnished axe that on the floor Rasped as he strode, the headsman came behind, And touched your shoulder. I could see his eyes Like blood-stained jewels sparkling in his mask. And there they stood, these three; more visible Than all this company, and so assigned To terror and the sundering of love, That though the way had been inlaid with fire, I should have trod a passage to my lord To reassure my heart. Urb. (pointing to the crown). A headsman waits Behind me; but the iron which he wields Augments the stature, sanctifies the life Of him on whom it falls. You find me well, And at the summit of my hopes. (placing Saturnia's hand in Pasqual's). Conduct This lady home. Sat. No! No!âThen you are king! [She withdraws her hand from Pasqual, and looks about her with bent brows, thinking it out.] The meaning of my dream? Oh! It was I That hung about your neck! The iron crown Is the broad axe to cut you off from me! But you will never leave me? Never? Never? Hild. Drag her away! Bish. Let not this evil thing Disturb the sweetness of our new accord. [Two Soldiers lay hands on Saturnia.] Sat. Oh! [twists herself out of the Soldiers' hands.] I will go aloneâif he commands. Urb. Go! Sat. (starts; shudders; then mournfully). Go! Once it was âcome,â and always âcome.â (whispering in Urban's ear). One wordâone secret word; then I will go. [Urban and Saturnia come down to the front.] Dear love, I understand. Before the world You must deny me; and chastise me too With bitterness and anger, since I came Uncalled, unwelcome, urged by foolish fears. But afterwards; to-nightâ Urb. (withdraws from Saturnia. Aloud). No; not to-night; Nor any night. I dare not. Here we part. The house you have, and half my private wealth, I give you that a soul so exquisite May live delightfully; thus I enshrine My past, endow my youth, and bury love, Even at its clustered prime and fragrant strength, Illustrious in a living tomb, engraved With happy memories for epitaph. Sat. The epitaph of love? Our love? No; no! I cannot live without you! Urb. Jealousy And every hatefulness would gnaw your life After to-day's event. I honour love, And the sweet spirit of the universe; I honour you, myself, and the true hearts That have exalted me to monarchy, By ending our communion in its flower. Sat. But you will see me once alone, my lord! Urb. Not once! I am the king of Lombardy. [turns his back on Saturnia.] Above all love and hate, and good and ill, The monarch, like the sun, on high designs With perfect will intent, moves in his sphere Dispensing light, alone. He cherishes Nothing but his dominion. Saturnia, Whom more than all the world I loved, I tear For ever from my heart. [A general murmur of admiration.] Sat. (seems about to fall; rejects the aid of a Soldier and goes out muttering). He dare not come, He said. I have his love. I hold him yet. [Urban takes Osmunda's hand and leads her to the coronation-stone, on which he seats her. Then he lifts the crown from the cushion and crowns himself.] Fate has bestowed it on me. Woe to him That touches it! I, who shall rule, adore This envied land, in purple vintages And golden harvests clad; adorned and veiled With braided rivers; thickly studded o'er With hearths that glow; with famous cities zoned From sea to sea, from Alp to Apennine. I am become this land, this Lombardy; Its azure waters seem to me my blood; Its snowy crests my crown; and in my heart The Lombards have their homeâthe quick, the dead, The ancient story and the flying days We'll fill with noble deeds. All. Long live the king! A YEAR ELAPSES</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Elixir VitÃ¦ Scene.âThe hall of the Royal Palace, Pavia. A large door at the back leads to the city. A similar door on the right opens on the Council-room. On the left are the entrances to the private apartments. At the back of the hall on the left is a curtained-off recess. Windows at the back look on a garden terrace, behind which in the distance the city appears. Tapestries and trophies of arms hang on the walls. Near the front on the left a table with several chairs. On the table a chess-board and men; a wine-jar, and goblets of gold and crystal. It is late in the afternoon when the act begins. The sun, setting behind the city, has disappeared by the end of the act; and the new moon, deeply coloured by the sunset, rises just above the sun. When the curtain rises Almeric and Ulric are discovered playing chess; and Thrasimund entering from the city in the dress of a pilgrim. Thrasimund has aged greatly; stoops; walks with a shuffling gait; smiles often; his voice quavers; he is on the verge of dotage. Ulr. A pilgrim! Alm. Check. [Ulric studies the game.] Thra. I wish to see the king. Alm. The king receives all comers, scallop-shell. But you must wait a while; the council sits. Ulr. That passed pawn spoiled my game. I give it up.â What news from Jericho and Istambul? [Almeric and Ulric rise from the table, and saunter towards Thrasimund.] Alm. Come, we are idle here. Embroider time With marvels for us. Did you see the eale Whose horns revolve like axle-fitted scythes; Satyrs and centaurs; sphinxes; pigmies; folk That never die, silent and adder-fed? Ulr. And how did you escape the leucrocotta, His cavern mouth, his single jaw-wide tooth, His human voice that cheats the vagabond? Or that heroic beast the antelope, Who saws down trees and conquers regiments With serried horns, woodman and warrior too? Thra. (takes off his hat, and peers at them). Young Almeric, andâUlric! Alm. and Ulr. Thrasimund! Alm. Your garb, your absence, your reported death Deceived us both. Ulr. Where have you travelled, sojourned, Slept and fed, risked life and limb, this year past? Thra. Back from Jerusalem and many a shrine I come to crave the mercy of the king. Consider: I have pardoned Violante. Alm. Why, then, indeed, the king may pardon you! Thra. I found her in seclusion, where she wore A novice's attire. She let me see The scourge she used. Time lapses; fancy shifts; Impressions wither; we are reconciled. Alm. A ballad-ending! Very wisely done! Thra. You think the king will see me? Alm. Certainly. Thra. I wear my pilgrim's garb to fetch his fancy. Alm. Good! Thra. If humility and penance fail, I have a secret to persuade his grace. Alm. A jewel? Thra. No; an odd discovery. The Pyramid of Life I call the thing, Or the Coeval Angle. Alm. What is that? [Thrasimund takes a burnished triangular shield from a trophy, and erects it, broad end down, on the table. Ulric leans against the wall watching Thrasimund with an amused smile. Almeric attends gravely.] Thra. Here is the symbol of the life of man. [touching one point of the base.] Birth. . . . Let me see now. [silently measures off four equal spaces on either side of the shield.] Yes; this point is birth. [striking the shield at regular intervals one side after the other.] The tenth, the twentieth, thirtieth, fortieth, year. The apex of the pyramid divides The fortieth from the fiftieth, you observe. Then fifty files with thirty; sixtyâtwenty; And seventy equals ten; while fourscore meets The point opposing birth. And now you know The Pyramid of Life. [lays down the shield.] Alm. By this you mean? Thra. The second half of life is sweeter far Than earlier years. [re-erects the shield and illustrates.] In climbing up the hill Your back is to the world; in coming down You take it leisurely and overlook A wide horizon. There is no such thing As old age, therefore. Alm. No! Thra. That is the soul Of my discovery. Look here, again. Eighty to seventy; one to ten: you seeâ The childhoods, first and second. Watch me well. Next: sixtyâtwenty; fiftyâthirty: youth And early manhood, first and second still. Fifty. . . . There should be properly a plain From thirty on to fifty; a plateau, The spacious, fertile, double prime of life. Where is old age? I cannot find its place: Old age is jostled from the Pyramid; The angle's sides are, as it were, coeval; There is not, never was, and cannot be The living phantom men have called old age. Alm. The true Elixir VitÃ¦ known at last! Thra. Elixir VitÃ¦? Ah, if that were found! Alm. To what end since senility is nought. Thra. But there is death! Aha, boys! Death chops in. [restores the shield to its place on the wall.] Still my Coeval Angle pleases you. You see the solace of it; and you think It may amuse the king? Experience proves That quaint originalities like this Avail with potentates, while solemn views Protract the musty tedium of life. Alm. Courtly discrimination! Thra. Tell me, now: How does my sorry reputation do? Has my misfortune on the election day Worn to a myth? Alm. No; it is talked of still. Thra. I'll live it down. By heaven, I'll live it down! Alm. Your reputation will be ruined then. Even for the thing you mourn your name is now The most renowned in Lombardy. Thra. My name! Alm. As patriot and prophet. Words of yours Ignite their hearts wherever men discuss:â âIn Urban you elect a malcontent, Whose aim will be to overturn the state, To rule as despot, and enslave us all.â It was a true prediction. In himself Urban has centred all authority, Defiantly and frankly, like a king! Thra. But Ludolf, Adalbert, and Hildebrand? Alm. Dismissed, impoverished, and mad with hate. Thra. And you are for the king? Alm. Yes; king's men both. Thra. Is the king's party strong? Alm. The king is strong. Thra. And popular? Alm. Adored by all his friends. Thra. Ay, but unpopular, you mean to say? Alm. He tithes the very blades of grass. Thra. For what? an army? Alm. Yes. Thra. Whom will he fight? Alm. That we may know to-day. Thra. The world goes on! How does he manage, wanting Hildebrand, A warrior of a thousand? Alm. Garda leads. Thra. The rebel! Then the world is upside down! And Lucian heads the opposition now? Alm. No; Hildebrand. Self-exiled on the day Osmunda married Urban, Lucian eats His heart out in Ravenna. Thra. Urban's wife, Daughter to Hildebrand, Urban's enemy! A diplomat may thrive!âAn heir? Alm. An heiress. Three weeks ago the queen was brought to bed. Thra. Well; well.âAnd so they talk of me. Alm. Oh yes! Your name's a watchword. [Ulric beckons to Almeric, and they talk apart.] Thra. (to himself). To abase myself Might prove a wanton waste of self-respect Since fame has so exalted me. This garb Misfits a popular leader. With the king I must be dignified.âGood-day, young men. My purpose changes; I shall wash away The stains of travel ere I come to court. [about to go.] Ulr. (detaining Thrasimund). A moment! How if we could supplement Your famous angle with the Elixir VitÃ¦! Thra. Elixir VitÃ¦! My old mouth waters at it! In Mesopotamia there lived a man Who found it out; but he by some strange chance Had passed away before I reached his town. Ulr. Mesopotamia calls for no regret. We have it here in Pavia. Thra. The Elixir! Ulr. I can procure a draught of the Elixir. Thra. My hearing sometimes falters. What? Ulr. I say I can procure a draught of the Elixir. Thra. Ha, ha! Jocose young man!âHave you it here? Ulr. It shall be at your service when you choose. Thra. I am not the man I was. Something played snap Inside my skull when Violante's letter Was read before the world. I cannot now, As with my former promptitude, detect Whether your grave demeanour cloaks a jest Or bares an honest purpose. Ulr. Oh, the proof Of puddings and elixirs is the same! Thra. Why, then I will be credulous till the proof! Procure the draught. The experiment at least May stir my pulse.âI live across the way. Expect me back as soon as I demit My chrysalis. [opens his pilgrim's gown and shows a courtier's dress beneath as he goes out.] Alm. He thinks, to change old age, You turn it like a mantle inside out. Ulr. As vapid truths revive by paradox. Alm. How will you compass this? Ulr. My scheme matures. [Enter Philadelphus from the city.] The very broker that the business wants! Phil. Are there no heads too hot yet for their shoulders? No executioner required to-night? Ulr. The old errand still! You never seem to tire. Phil. I haunt the palace like an evil genius. Ulr. And prosecute your canvas every day? Phil. Save holidays and Sundays every day Since Urban's coronation! I become An institution: legend marks me out. I revel in a more redoubted name, As indefatigable candidate For the unholy ultimate career Of headsmanship, than if I had cut off Six traitors every week. Ulr. The king remits The final doom. Alm. As despot he does well. His prisons are a nursery of arms; Out of the criminal he hews the soldier: So trims a ragged edge. Ulr. The murderer Can slaughter or be slaughtered, one would think, Like any other; and the thief may shine When plunder is the order of the day. Phil. I bide my time. Beside the armoury, In a dark cupboard that the cobwebs drape, The axe, the block, the headsman's dress await me. Ulr. How would you care to play a part meanwhileâ Turn a dishonest penny by the hire Of your loquacity? Phil. I never look At two sides of a coin; for I can make The false go farther than most men the trueâ Or I were no philosopher! Ulr. You rogue! Come after me. You are to personate A wizard, and exhibit life's elixir. Phil. I will exhibit any nostrum, pill, Or panacea men insist upon; And I can personate any one you like, Being a compendium of humanity. [Ulric and Philadelphus leave the hall by a private door.] Enter from the Council-room a number of Lords. They go out at the back in twos and threes, talking as they go. 1st L. He drills us like a drift of dunces; talks Engaging generalities; and laughs Behind our backs. 2nd L. We have a king, my lord; We have a king! 3rd L. Who's for the wars, then, who? 4th L. I follow still the crowd. 3rd L. Wise man. 4th L. I've held Before to-day a candle to the devil. 5th L. I wish it was this time next year, I do! 6th L. A coward's wish! Say rather, well begun! 5th L. You'll find a puddle in the smoothest road. 6th L. Fear you no puddles. Little wit will serve; Women and fortune worship fools, you know. [Laughter and all out.] Enter from the Council-room Urban, reading a paper. After him Pasqual and the Duke of Garda. Almeric salutes and goes out. Pasq. Will you not give me leave to speak my mind? Urb. Why so demure? I ask for nothing else. You never found your friend intolerant. Gar. Let me speak mine. The word is, up and march! I know the Ãmilian way's a Roman road, And excellent travelling too; nevertheless His majesty may mean Ravenna-wards. But if his purpose were the end of the earth And headlong to the abyss, I am the man To lead his army on! Urb. Without such men Kings were impossible. Gar. And wanting kings Such men as I are ineffectual. Urb. (giving Garda the paper.) All is set down. Good speed. Until to-morrow. [Garda goes out.] Now, Pasqual, the perplexed, what malady Afflicts your fancy? [sits at the table.] Pasq. You are my disease. Ambition like a robe of flame has girt You, shutting out the wholesome world; and I Am sick to think my comrade and my king May blaze to ashes in his own desire. Urb. That is the end of all men, whether they be Of wood or adamant; for in themselves Resides the fire that burns them at the stake Appointedâavarice, ambition, love. Pasq. But you admit no counsel, share your thought With no man. Urb. Ah! jealous of my design! Well; you shall know it first, I swear, old friend. Pasq. Are you not somewhat selfish with your friend? Urb. Selfish? Yes! When I weary of myself And take no joy in Urban, then the world Has ceased to be! Accept me, for I like you; But never hope that you shall understand Me, or the meanest being that can think. And love yourself! Oh, learn to love yourself! Consider how the silent sun is rapt In self-devotion! All things work for good To them that love themselves.âHow shall we spend Our happiness till supper-time? [picks up a chessman.] Pasq. Oh no! You always win. Re-enter Ulric and Philadelphus. Philadelphus wears a long gown, and is disguised in long grey beard and hair. He carries a bag. Urb. Ulric, what masker's this? He has purloined, it seems, the very gait Of Philadelphus. Ulr. He, your majesty! He personates an Ãthiopian mage, And means to doctor Thrasimund with drops Of the Elixir VitÃ¦. Urb. Thrasimund! Ulr. Returned to-day, a dotard from the East, Affecting youth offensively; our aim, To make him entertaining, if we may. Urb. Pursue it. I shall watch. Phil. Your majesty Detected my disguise; but notwithstanding, I think it could beguile a shrewder wit Than his whose vanity we'll titivate. Urb. Try Almeric. He waits without. [Ulric goes to the door at the back and beckons Almeric.] Phil. (goes up stage humming). I am the alchemist you wot of; I couple the antipodes; My skill is vaster and more thought of Than Hermes Trismegistus's. [stands at the back.] Ulr. He comes. Re-enter Almeric. Urb. Have you seen Thrasimund? Alm. Yes, your majesty. Urb. What word of Violante? Alm. Reconciled. Urb. Better and better! [Philadelphus comes down stage slowly, describing a pentacle in the air to the right.] Michael of Pavia! Whom have we here? Alm. He scribbles in the air. Some fortune-teller, some eccentric cheat. [Philadelphus describes a pentacle in the air to the left.] Expert in gesture, his aÃ«rial script Prefiguresâmendicancy. Phil. (describing a pentacle in the air in front). Watch me score The mystic pentacle that purges space. Alm. I had forgotten! Philadelphus! Well! Phil. âI am the alchemist you wot of.â Ulr. Hush!âThrasimund! Alm. Your tackle's ready? Phil. (opens the bag). See, Every appliance for renewing youth! Re-enter Thrasimund, dressed in an extravagantly youthful style. Urb. Welcome, my lord. Thra. Your majesty! Have I Your gracious pardon? Urb. All the past is dead. Thra. Then am I young already. Urb. True; But not so young as you will shortly be. We are prepared, my lord. Greet the renowned Egyptian necromancerâwhat's his name?â Amen Psammeticus, in exile here By malice of incompetent rivalry. Thra. You know of my experiment, it seems. Urb. I know, approve, admire. Thra. There's no such thing As old age, I maintain; yet bones grow stiff; Brains, tender; pulses domptable. Urb. Old age Is doubtless a satirical report Which inexperience foists upon mankind. Nevertheless it may not be amiss That magic should avert such accidents As shedding of the lovelocks and the teeth, And pale dilution of the sober blood; For all these things give plausibility To slanders put about by wanton youth. Pasq. It is a shameful thing for age to eke The filthy dregs of stale incontinence. Urb. Yes; but it's bravery in the breed of men That all should want to live their lives again. Thra. Ah, to be young and fresh, your majesty, With all one's own experience engraved Upon a fertile brain and thumping heart! Urb. Or even without one's own experience. Saint And sinner willingly would be once more Just what they have been; in our children too We happily recur to the end of time. Phil. (has filled a crystal goblet with wine and holds a phial in his hand). Now, all is ready. Urb. Let me see the Elixir. [takes the phial from Philadelphus, and walks up stage with it, looking at it against the light. Philadelphus follows him, and they talk in whispers.] What action on the wine? Phil. 'Twill turn it blue. Urb. On him? Phil. He'll sleep like twenty for a space. [They return to Thrasimund.] Urb. These are the last drops of the Elixir VitÃ¦ Remaining on the earth: never again Will any haggard alchemist compound Potable life; the secret of it died With the discoverer. What cause, what whim Ordains this dew of youth for you, ask not. Give thanks, and drink. [Philadelphus holds the goblet, and Urban empties the phial into it. The wine immediately becomes blue. Thrasimund is about to take it, but Urban snatches it away.] Urb. Cerulean cordial! If I were certain that this crystal held A freehold tenure of time with energy Instant and inexhaustible! Thra. (clasping and unclasping his hands). My liege, You will not surely take it from me now! Urb. (ignoring Thrasimund). Never to know decay of appetiteâ Thra. Ah! Urb. The ineffectual nerves, the crumbling thought, The feeble pulses of senility! Thra. Ay! Urb. But to be tensely strung and give response Full-souled to every pang of pleasure and pain; To be impassioned always and not to die! Thra. You said it was ordained by fate for me! Urb. (gives the goblet to Thrasimund, who gulps the contents). For you! Drink to the dregs, credulity! Thra. (nauseates the draught, and looks ruefully from one to the other). This is a draught of death! You have poisoned me! [He becomes unconscious. Ulric and Almeric place him in a chair, and Philadelphus operates immediately, Ulric and Almeric handing him from the bag, scissors, razor, soap, rouge, and everything necessary for the change.] Pasq. How pitiful! And how can you permit Your leisure so invidious a sport? Urb. Why, this is nothing! When Medea turned An old man young again she chopped him up, And boiled him in a caldron for a week. Pasq. Pardon my thinking it is idly done: You will regret it. Urb. Never, friend of mine, Even if it were iniquity. Regrets Of all remorseful people in the world, What are they when the morning comes again, And every heart-beat wakes a virgin future! I hear the moments fathom the abyss, From which no power can ever haul them up. Why lug about the memory of the past? Make a clean mind of it! Say, alchemist, Do you indulge in vain regrets? Phil. (busy with Thrasimund's face). Not I! Pasq. Have you endured no bitter grief? Phil. Oh yes! Pasq. Done anything to be called wrong? Phil. I have. Pasq. And played the fool perhaps? Phil. More than enough. Pasq. How can you say, then, you have no regrets! Urb. He has another use for his mishaps Than to regret them. Pasq. What may that be? Urb. Why, To digest them, Pasqual. Hence have we brains! A mental mastication, slow and sure, Eupeptic consciences and wilful blood Transform our blunders to experience, sinew And staple of all wisdom. [Philadelphus stands aside and reveals the rejuvenated Thrasimund. His beard has been shaved off; his hair and moustache dyed red; his eyebrows soaped; and his cheeks rouged.] Urb. Handsome youth! A shade too florid; but colour is convincing. Send for his wife and we shall see them meet. [Philadelphus and Almeric carry Thrasimund in his chair to the recess at the back, and he is hidden behind the curtain. Ulric takes the message to Violante.] [Enter Junipert, gaily dressed. Juni. Salute, your majesty! Alm. What is your name, And business? Phil. An astucity of ours, Magicians, necromancers, is to know The names of chance-companions. His, I think, Is Junipert. Juni. It is. My business, now? Alm. Come, sorcerer. Phil. His business? That profane Unprofitable art of poem-making. Juni. My business with the king, I mean. Phil. Oh, that! You come upon Saturnia's behalf, Who saved you from a beggary more base By making you her laureate, Junipert. Juni. All this the world may hear from envious tongues. Can you announce my mistress's affair? Phil. That you are here to tellâand luckily; For my prophetic frenzy ends at once. Urb. Well, sir? Juni. I have the honour to appear For the forlorn, divine Saturnia, Queen of the Lombards. Having newly learned That Lombardy is on the eve of war, She craves an audience of your majesty To bid farewell. Urb. When did Saturnia Become a queen? Juni. Upon your wedding-day. Phil. Very poetical! Pasq. My lord? Urb. Yes, friend. Pasq. Give her no audience. Urb. Did you know of this? Pasq. I did. Indoors she keeps a pagan state, But never moves abroad. Urb. And I, untold! I must have spies, it seems!âspies, and a headsman! Say to Saturnia Urban grants her wish. Pasq. Your majestyâ Urb. Now, you are meddlesome. Not since we parted has she brought herself In any way at all to my remembrance. Doubt not, since now she does so, she obeys Some clear necessity. Juni. I humbly thank Your majesty. My mistress will set out As soon as I return. Urb. (softly to himself). Saturnia, Queen of the Lombards. [goes out by a private door. Pasqual goes out towards the city.] Juni. Have you by any chance A brother in the town, called Philadelphus? Phil. Augmenting daily a prodigious fame By diligent pursuit of what he wants; A great philosopher? Juni. He calls himself Philosopher; notorious too, he is, For some absurdity. Phil. Notorious be it. I know him very well; a noble fellow. Juni. I never liked the man at all. Phil. No? Well; I shall go with you, and tell you certain truths About yourself will make you like him less. [They go out together.] Enter Hildebrand. Alm. (astonished to see him). Good day, my lord. Hild. Does the queen leave her room? Alm. I cannot tell; but here is nurse who can. Enter Nurse. Hild. How is my grandchild? Nurse. Very well, my lord. Heaven bless your lordship! You are a stranger here; But births compose old quarrels. [Hildebrand shows displeasure.] For her eyesâ As like her father's as a pair of beads; And such a handsome nose! I think we know From whom your lordship's grandchild takes her nose! And noticing already! Enter two Men-servants with cushions and shawls. They cross the hall to the back, the Nurse nodding approval. Hild. And the queen's health? Nurse. Oh, wonderful! Her grace will take the air To-day for the first time. Servant. Where shall we put them? Nurse. Under the chestnut, by the bed of pinks, Beside the carp-pond. I must see myself! The queen will come immediately, my lord. [goes out, preceded by the Men-servants.] Hild. Go after them. Alm. I am in attendance here. Hild. Attend without, then! I would be alone With the king's wife, my daughter. [Almeric goes out sullenly.] Enter Osmunda, attended by Ladies, one of whom carries Sybil. Osm. (surprised and gratified). Happilyâ Most happily! My first encounter, father! Hild. Sweet peace betide you; joy and all delight! [They are both embarrassed. At last Osmunda leads her father by the hand to the Lady who carries Sybil.] Your child, my dear? Osm. My child! She is asleep. Oh, you should see her eyes! like sapphire lamps Burning with sacred fire! They laugh at me; But I am sure she knew me yesterday. [accompanies the Ladies out, and returns immediately.] You wish to see the king? You will be friends? Hild. Do you desire it? Osm. Why am I his wife? Hild. That was my fault and folly. And I come To beg my daughter's pardon, now, at last. Osm. Oh, sir, beg no one's pardon! Be yourself! Hild. I am myself now truly; and what amends May yet be wrung from destiny, I mean To gladden you withal. [They sit.] The king has thrust The state aside like useless lumber; rears Himself alone in front of Lombardy, Dazzling the foolish world. Furbished, equipped, And amply manned, by stealth and unprovoked, Against the Franks he marches forth tomorrow. Osm. Against the Franks! Hild. It is reported so. Their new king, Pepin, has made a name in war, And Urban is envious. But some of us Who cherish peace and reverence law, will choke This outrage ere it issue to the light. Osm. What do you mean? Hild. You must know all in time; This, now: We shall proclaim our Lucian king; You, regent. Osm. Regentâking! while Urban lives? Hild. (rises; deliberately). No. Osm. (rises, and withdraws from her father). You would not murder him! Hild. We shall do No murder. Urban is the rebel; we, His peers, have sat in judgment. All my friends Await us at my house. Thither I go. Come after with your daughter, openly. Osm. My father plots against my husband's life! Hild. What! would you spare a husband you abhor? [grasps her hand.] Do what I say. Osm. I will not do this thing. Hild. Will not! Osmunda! [releases her hand, and speaks persuasively, imploringly.] But I hide the heart Of my desire. Not for a jealous clique, Not to crown Lucian, nor avenge your wrongs Or my defeat, have I in prudent age And the dispassionate temper time implants, Belied my judgment, strangled every birth Of conscience, fertile yet as the fresh ground In times Saturnian, though blood be stale And life at ebb; but I have gagged my thought, Tarnished the silver of the years myself In reverence held, for you and for your child, My blood, that it may reign in Lombardy. Lucian?âa stalking-horse! And step by step, Ruse upon ruse, as studied and secure As any gambit, have I planned it out To make my grandchild queen. This perfect plot Was nurtured in my brain while in your womb Your daughter grew; and their affinity Is indestructible: the plot, the child, Are one; my blood, my brain. Throughout these months Of impotence, dishonour, nothingness, The infamy and canker of defeat, By this design transmuted, seemed to me Renown and health. My daughter dare not thwart me! Osm. I am a wife; and to the king, my husband, I will be loyal: a mother, and Urban's child Shall never say that I deceived her father Even for my father's sake. [sits again, trembling at the direct conflict with her father.] Hild. You will not come! Osm. (rises; beseechingly). Oh, escape This cruel goad of power! Stay here by me: The plot will melt away if you withdraw. Stay by me all the evening; sleep here to-night; And in the morning this will be a dream. Hild. And leave my daughter, whom I offered up On the stained altar of a loveless bed, A nightly victim, while my stricken soul Discerns its guilt, and grasps expedient means Of reparation and deliverance! Osm. I am contentedâhappy, as I am. Hild. It is your weakness speaks! When Urban dies, Your true love Lucian, for a time, perhapsâ Osm. This is to temptâto tempt! The king must know! [runs to the door of the Council-room, and opening it, looks in.] Not here!âWhat shall I do? Hild. (to himself). At fault! at fault! Now must I act at once! Leave her in doubtâ I know her natureâshe will fear to speak.â Truly, Osmunda, my conspiracy Is rooted in your will. You cast it out; It dies, and as I say it, disappears Into the limbo of abortive things. If I have hurt you yet it was for you I chiefly wrought. Forget it. Osm. You will stay? Hild. Stay? Osm. Yes, with me until to-morrow. Hild. No; I must instruct my friends, or they may move Without me to disaster. Osm. Stay by me! Hild. I cannot. Rest in peace. All shall be well. [goes out.] Osm. All shall be well!âDo I misjudge this manâ My father?âwho would pander to my dream, And tear from heaven a memory insphered Among the stars, as distant and as sweet! Re-enter Nurse. Nurse. Madam!âmadam! Osm. Bring me my baby, nurse. Nurse. But, madam, weâ Osm. And bid them all return. [Nurse goes out in a huff.] My heart has quite forgotten Lucian, now! Only the spirit of my early love Is vigilant above me in the skies.â To tell my husband? To accuse my father! How if my father means to stay his hand? Were I to tell of it, and he repent!â I know what I shall do; I see a way! How glad I am the king had gone!â [goes to the door at the back.] Quick, nurse! Re-enter Nurse, Servants, and Ladies with Sybil. Osm. (taking Sybil in her arms). Poor mite!âpoor little woman. Had you been A boyâI had not loved you better! No!â Go in. [gives Sybil to the Nurse.] Nurse. Already, madam? Why the air Is like a cup of hippocras! Osm. A cup Is brewing, nurse, I hope we may set by. Get all of you into the turret-room; stay there Till I return. Nurse. Oh, madamâ Osm. Not a word! [detaining one of her Ladies.] You come with me. I am going to the camp; Out by the garden gate and through the city, To see the Duke of Garda, or to take Command myself. I have a thing to do.â No; arm in arm. Cover your face. [Osmunda and one of her Ladies veil their faces and go out by a private door, while the Nurse, etc., return to their apartments. Re-enter Almeric. He draws aside the curtain and shows Thrasimund still asleep. Ulric re-enters at the same time. Ulr. How is the patient? Alm. Judging by his hue In a high fever. Is Violante coming? Ulr. She follows me. Alm. The ruddy-cheeked Adonis Begins to stir. See! . . . You must tell the king. [Ulric goes out, while Thrasimund opens his eyes, blinks, sits up, twists about his head, and rubs his neck.] Thra. Been sleeping in a draught? and with a draught In me, now I remember. Filthy stuff! Something has happened. I have been asleepâ That's certainty. Was it rejuvenescence? The beauty sleep? I wonder. [rises and comes down, endeavouring to walk with a youthful stride, but soon drops into the old man's shuffle.] Elixir VitÃ¦ Is not a remedy for rheumatism. Alm. (affecting not to know Thrasimund). You wish to see the king? Thra. Yes . . . you . . . . Alm. What name Shall I announce? Re-enter Ulric. Thra. And you? Do you not know me? Ulr. Know you? Not from Adam! Alm. Where's Thrasimund? Ulr. His chair is empty! Alm. (professing to recognize him). Thrasimund! By heaven! Ulr. Not a day older now than Almeric! Alm. Frankly, my lord, I thought the mage a quack; But such a sprightly eye, such lustrous looks, And the whole juvenility and joy Of life, your effluence and aureole Proclaim the matchless virtue of the elixir. Thra. (feeling his chin). My beard! It seems to have removed my beard. Alm. It has a powerâ Thra. And left me my moustache! Alm. And subtlety beyond belief. Ulr. (whispering). The king, Until Saturnia has been and gone, Sees no one, Almeric. Astounding news! [They talk apart.] Thra. (to himself). This, my moustache, which once was grey, is now A very brilliant auburnâand my hair. When I was youngâthe first timeâI believe The hue was mousy-brown. A potent draught! An impotent old fool! If it had turned My ancient rheumatism to muscle now, And made me feel a youth! Perhaps the feeling Develops later on. I took the thing Internally; but medicine so occult May start its operation from without. I am in process of renovation. Faith Is always half the cure. I will behave, Despite delusion, youthfully, and help The magic potion. Re-enter Philadelphus and Junipert. The latter, endeavouring to shake off Philadelphus, walks quickly round the hall; but the philosopher sticks to him. Phil. So my philosophy In character is altogether new; The essence of a personal experience Not to be brought to book by culture; butâ Thra. (catching Philadelphus's sleeve). The sorcerer himself! It was no dream! You gave me of the Elixir VitÃ¦? Phil. Yes. [takes Thrasimund by the shoulders and gravely examines his appearance.] The pupilâthirty; irisâtwenty-five. The agency has not been equable. Show me your tongue. A little pallid; that, Indubitably constitutional. Your pulse?âUmph!âSixty-six, but regular. Complexion sanguine; the moustache and hair A goodly red. In spite of certain faults, Irregularities that mark in you The assimilation of rejuvenescence, I honestly pronounce you, let us say, A healthy, capable courageous man Of twenty-eight. Thra. But then my rheumatism? Phil. The pain of that may trouble you for long, Just as the soldier who has lost a foot May feel its corns in rainy weather shoot. But I assure you it is gone, quite gone. Thra. I see. Phil. And were you certain of your health Already, you were less or more than man. But you can test and prove your youth at once And most decisively. Saturnia, The Queen of Lombardyâ Thra. Osmunda! Phil. No; Saturnia. The Elixir innovates Not the imbiber only, but the whole Condition of the world. Have patience, now. The mystery will unfold itself in time. You must approach Saturnia when she comes; Address her gallantly; recall your youth; Employ your fascination; play the man; Observe how your appearance and your talk Enchant the queen, and be convinced for good. Thra. What shall I talk about? Phil. A traveller asks A subject of discourse! Thra. Why, to be sure! Enter two Girls garlanded, playing on pipes. After them young Men and Maidens representing Eros and Psyche, Maia, Flora, Vertumnus and Pomona, Sylvanus, Faunus, Pan, Nymphs and Shepherds with thyrsi and crooks. After these Saturnia, wearing a gold crown and a rich robe of state, followed by her Seneschal, Chamberlain, and other Officers fantastically dressed. Junipert joins the group. Ulric goes out quickly. Sat. The kingâwhere is he? Phil. (whispering). Briskly now, my lord. Thra. The king is busy in his chamber, madam. Sat. Who is this lord? [sits in a chair which has been placed for her in the centre of the hall.] Thra. My name is Thrasimund, Fresh from Jerusalem. Beneath the hills Of Lombardy I went by Danube's banks! And to behold that river would surprise you: Out of the land it bursts with such a force, Such volume that for thirty miles the sea Is sweet as mountain springs. Jerusalem? A marvellous city! This astonished me: It has no river; now I always thought It stood upon the Jordan. Not at all: The Jordan rolls its waves a long way off. Were you aware of that? Sat. Why this to me? Thra. I wish to entertain you with my travels. Sat. Indeed you entertain me wondrously! Thra. Why, that consoles and gratifies me, madam. And if you knew the reason of my wish To please, to entertain, to fascinate, You would be highly pleased, and entertained, And fascinated, I make bold to say. Enter Violante. She comes slowly down the hall, unseen by Thrasimund. Ulr. (whispering to Philadelphus). Look; Violante and the crisis comes! Sat. Pray, fascinate me, then. Thra. In me behold, If men be true and alchemy no lie, The most astounding creature in the world. Sat. Indeed I think you are! Thra. My lustrous looks Have drawn remark already; but the source, The secret of my beautyâ Sat. I understand At last! You are a treasure to the king, A constant solace, doubtless.âJunipert, I have no court fool. See that you get me one. Could he be lent me for a day or two? Thra. Magician! [looks about for Philadelphus, who has hidden himself at the back of the hall.] Court fool! lend me! Viol. It is I Who have the lending of this gentleman. Thra. (much dismayed). My dearâ Viol. Come home with me, sir. We are quits! Thra. (becoming intensely excited). I'm not the old uxorious fool I was; A young man, Violante! I have drained The last known drops of the Elixir VitÃ¦. It may be I shall never die. Viol. Come home! Thra. The world's my home; doomsday my only fear! Re-enter Ulric, ushering Urban. In the beginning of the act Urban had been carelessly dressed; he has now donned a magnificent costume. Your majesty! [Urban ignores Thrasimund, and advances gravely to Saturnia, who rises, curtsies, and before Urban can prevent her, kisses his hand. Thrasimund continues in a loud voice to Violante.] It was the king himself Who dropped the Elixir VitÃ¦ in the cup. It made it blue; he saw me drink: the king Is art and part in my rejuvenescence! Urb. You have a fair Saturnian following. Sat. My life is empty; and it feeds my thought To make a pageant of my retinue. [Urban gives Saturnia his hand across the hall to the door of the Council-room, where Ulric leads her out.] Urb. Await me in the presence-room. Thra. Now then! Urb. Show him a mirror. [Almeric takes from the wall the burnished shield which Thrasimund had used, and holds it before him.] The Coeval Angle! Thra. (stares at the shield; thrusts his face into it; with his handkerchief he wipes his cheek and sees the rouge. He strikes the shield with his fist; braces himself and stands very stiffly amid the subdued laughter of the bystanders). But I will be avenged for this; I will, Somehow, be speedily avenged for this. [goes out at a measured pace.] Urb. The thirst for vengeance has renewed his strength, And thus the Elixir Vitae operates. Viol. (demurely). Have you no mercy for a penitent? Urb. Attend your husband, madam; treat him well. (To Saturnia's retinue, gaily). What we can offer you in lieu of nectar, What mortal viands least worthy the disdain Of your immortal palates, shall be placed Before you. Pleasure at your table wait. [goes out through the Council-room. Almeric and Ulric are ushering Saturnia's retinue by a private door as the curtain falls.] NO INTERVAL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III The Conspiracy Scene.âThe Presence-room in the Royal Palace, Pavia. A throne stands near the centre. There are windows at the back overlooking a garden, and large doors right and left. Lamps are lit. The new moon, at first golden in the light of the fading sunset, shines over the city. As the act proceeds the stars come out, and the moon goes down. On the rising of the curtain Saturnia is discovered in her robe and crown, seated on the throne. Sat. Shall I have courage? Lofty and cold he seemed. [rises, and listens at the door on the right.] He comesâand comes alone! A challenge! Oh, I know him! He would prove his self-command. [returns to the throne, but remains standing.] What shall I do? How shall I conquer him? With my true love! Only with my true love! Enter Urban. He sits at once on the throne. Urb. Why have you come? Sat. To hear you speak to me. I see you every day when you ride forth; I watch you in the evening riding home. Last night the sun behind you set in pomp; And the new moon rode out beside the sun, A silver bride, gold-stained, the pageant's queenâ Close to the sun, a token, richly lit With triumph and intolerable joy. And all the night I wept: I wept all night, Because I never may ride out with you. Then in the morning I began to know Unless I heard your voice that I should die.â Oh! speak to me. Urb. You have soiled the name of queen, Tarnished the crown, and forfeited your life. Sat. Tarnished the crown? I have not tarnished it. I crowned myself upon your wedding-day, And bade my people call me queen, to know In fancy the embroidery of love That should be mine. Urb. That should be yours? Sat. Mine! mine! The crown was tarnished when you cast me off. Such love as ours!âRemember . . . [Urban rises, impatient with himself, as he feels his resolution shaken.] But remember! I was Saturnia, the golden age Incarnate; one inspired by innocence And beauty to annul the use and wont Of musty centuries. They were your words! [Urban sinks down on the throne.] Urb. I set you free and made of you a friend; Taught you to know, and watched your loveliness Increase and deepen as your spirit grew In apprehension and accomplishment. Then I . . . (hesitates). Sat. What then? Why, when our lives had knit Themselves in one, you hacked me off as men In frenzies cut and hew their limbs; and all To please the Lombard nobles, to exalt Your glory as a self-denying king! Urb. All that was dearest I severed from my heart: The votary of empire dare not spend His idlest moment on a passionate love. Sat. Empire! What is empire? Where is Rome That sat above the nations? Power and state Are dust and ashes to a love like mine! [takes off her crown, and drops it on the floor.] Fall, shadow of a shadow! Foolish gown! [unfastens her robe. It slips from her shoulders, and she appears as in the first act.] I know now that I cannot live again As I have lived. Take back the queenly wealth You gave me. I am Urban's slave, and happy. I have thrown the burden off. [kneels at his feet.] What will you do? Urb. (looks at her long; rises irresolutely. At last, standing beside her, he replies). I will go on with what I have decreed. [is about to leave her; but she seizes his hand and rises, drawing closer to him as she speaks, until she has her hands in his hair, and her cheek on his breast.] Sat. And I from woe to woe! I bleed to death, Cut off from you. I am a part of you: Kill me outright, if that will help; if not, Leave me no longer a phantasmal thing To fade alone, but make me your delight, And bid me crown your glory with my love. Urb. (taking her fingers from his hair.) My fate is in my hands! Were I to make You mine again, the conduct of my life Would pass from my control. I will go on King of myself. I tore you from my heart: That sacrifice accomplished, is there a deed Between me and my aim to make me shrink? Sat. But whyâwhy tear me from your heart? Urb. (angrily). Is that A mystery still? My love for you engulfed My blood and thought: I had to be Your lover only, or a king of men; And to be king is greater than to love! Sat. But I could be contented with a look, A word between your triumphs. Urb. I love myself Too well to overthrow the edifice And fair proportion of my youth; and you Too well to change the soul that opened heaven For me, and made me man, into the stale And fashionable mistress of a king. Power is my chosen bride! Voices (from the Council-room). The king! the king! [He draws his sword, and holding Saturnia behind him with his left hand, crosses to the door on the left. This bursts open as he reaches it, and Thrasimund, Ludolf, Adalbert, and Soldiers enter armed. Urban leaps back with Saturnia, making for the other door; but by it Pasqual, Almeric, and Ulric are driven in, fighting with Hildebrand and other Lords and Soldiers. Some of the Rabble and a few Citizens crowd in; among them Philadelphus and Junipert. Lastly the Bishop enters. Urban, overpowered by Hildebrand and others, is in danger of his life.] Bish. Take him alive! [Urban is seized from behind and his hands tied. Pasqual, Almeric, and Ulric are driven out fighting.] Thra. (fiercely, pointing to Saturnia). Truss up this wanton here! [Soldiers tie Saturnia's hands.] Now, madam queen, that would have me for fool! Hild. (to the Bishop). For whom are you? Bish. For justice! Hild. So am I! Thra. So are we all! Hild. Urban, you are deposed. Urb. For what offence? Hild. The crimes that kings commit When power corrupts them into enemies Of law and of their country. You must die. Thra. (raising his sword). And I shall be his executioner! Urb. You will not mend the laws you say I broke By killing me off-hand. My peers must hear Me speak in my defence. Bish. It is most just. Hild. Time pinches us, my lord. He has many friends. Bish. He must have justice, though he be unjust. Hild. Brief justice, then! Here in the presence-room. Urb. (to Thrasimund, indicating Saturnia). What has this gentle prisoner done, my lord? Thra. I have both hands full of my vengeance, now! Urb. (smiling). It ill becomes your juvenility To cherish hate, so rapidly matured, Against Saturnia, the golden age. Thra. Lewd mocker!âTake her hence! Her turn will come. [Saturnia is led out.] Lud. Let Thrasimund preside. Adal. The wisest head In Lombardy, the true-divining brain That first unmasked this subtle tyrant. Thra. No, Too partial friends; I play another rÃ´le. It is the bishop's place. Sit here, my lord. [The Bishop takes the throne.] Hild. Now, Urban, your defence. Bish. Let him first know Of what he stands accused. Hild. (to the Bishop). You shall preside; But we, my lord, who risk our lives and lands, Stealing what is the world's due, justice, mean Our purpose to achieve with all despatch.â (to Urban).] Speak. Urb. Give me matter; formulate a charge. Discourses hung on nothing squander time, Of which you seem so chary. Thra. Answer me, then! Why are Duke Hildebrand and my good friends, Ludolf and Adalbert, and every mind Grounded in policy and capable of rule, Dismissed from office, power, emolument? Voices. Ay! ay! Lud. Power, privilege, and fortune gone! Thra. Why do you levy war without advice And secretly?âTo sum up all, my lords, The King of Lombardy, a judge in peace, In war a leader, has deposed himself By heedless usurpation of the powers That rest in law alone. Let him show cause Why he should not be haled to instant death. Hild. What need? Why should he speak? It maddens me To see him standing there, a felon, bound, Mature for death, disdaining all of us! I will not hear him! Death, and no word more! Voices. Death! death! Bish. It must not be. You may undo Injustice by injustice, but the right Can be established only by the right.â My lord and king, for such you are, we wait Your pleasure. Urb. Most reverend, and my lords, My pleasure is to bid you think.âWith man Abides an instinct unsubduable To utter and make good what in him lies Of power and greatness. Hild. Oh! we know this plea! So reasoned Lucifer when he rebelled. Urb. Lucifer claimed a place which was not his. How, if I have, as I believe I have, A natural right to do as I have done? Hild. Shall we hear more? Lud. The man's a nincompoop! Urb. Your anger vindicates my secret way. No hero publishes what he intends, Because to tell of deeds that are undone Is to distemper them in paltry minds, And blunt their edge against the world's ill-will. Thra. A hero! you! It was heroicâyes!â To give an old man in a cup of wine A sleep like death that ribald mountebanks And mocking boys might load him with contempt! It is a sort of parricide for youth To bring age to derision: that alone Deserves an instant, ignominious death! Voices. Death! instant death! Bish. Urban, if you can show How in your hidden counsel the commonweal Might reap peculiar benefit, the law May yet be set aside. Urb. Is that my choice? Death or to tell my purpose? Bish. No, my lord; To tell your purpose will not save your life, Unless your purpose and its secrecy Receive our sanction. Urb. I am too young to dieâ To reach the welcome threshold of renown, Then step into an unremembered grave! Here's for my life!âThe empire of the world, No less, is my ambition. Marauding hordes Have made the earth a byword. Without a head, The peoples now become each other's prey; And the imperial throne awaits the king Who knows himself its destined occupant. My passion and my dream replenished me With self-faith absolute. Of Lombardy I had forged a blade to reap the nations with. The centred might of all humanity I meant to grasp, as CÃ¦sar did before, And hear the astonished world hail me divine. Voices (laughing scornfully). Ha! ha! ha! ha! Bish. You have condemned yourself. Hild. A cut-throat king, who of his countrymen Would make a knife to rob upon the highway! Urb. My lords, it is with nations as with men: One must be first. We are the mightiest, The heirs of Rome; and with the power there lies A ruthless obligation on our souls To be despotic for the world's behoof. Ruthless, I say; because the destinies Admit no compromise: we must be first, Though everlasting war cement each course Of empire with our blood; or cease to be, Our very name and language in dispute. I am your king. Untie my bonds, and say, âBe great, and make us great!â Hild. We'll have no wars! Adal. There are our lands to till, our towns to build. Bish. God grant us peace in our time! You must die. The empire of the sword has passed away; The world is now the City of God; in Rome His great vicegerent reigns. Hild. Strike off his head! Lud. Who shall behead him? Bish. True; we have no headsman. Hild. That strange, half-crazy fellow Philadelphus, Give him the place he seeks. [Philadelphus comes forward, rubbing his hands.] Urb. No headsmanâ Hild. No; Thanks to your imbecile humanity! Urb. No king to make one either, I being deposed! But it is common law in Lombardy That, if there be no headsman, one condemned To death may take the officeâwhich, indeed, Is civil death. Even at so great a cost I'll save my life, loving it as I do. [Incredulous murmurs.] Bish. You will be headsman! Adal. You, the pardoner, The ape of mercy! Urb. Life is sweet, my lords. Bish. How pitiful a thing a tyrant is! Hild. He punishes himself more terribly Than our just sentence. Bish. But it is the law, Which you are here in arms to vindicate. Phil. Your cowardice, my lord, your tragic-farce Is tragedy for me: I had grasped the axe Almost.âWell, I shall be your acolyte. Hild. Off with him! Clad him in the headsman's dress, And bring him quickly back. Phil. Come, master mine. I know where all is kept. Thra. The emperor Of the world! Urb. Emperor? Viceroy, the headsman isâ Death's deputy. Bish. Though such a bloodless change Is not ungrateful, yet it grieves my soul To find you out a craven at the core. [Urban is about to retort, but refrains; bows gravely, and is led out, followed officiously by Philadelphus.] Bish. To-morrow we shall meet to choose a king. [goes out.] Lud. Our king is chosen: Lucian! All. Lucian! Lucian! Thra. Resource is coiled in Urban's brain, a swarm Of snakes; he'll dupe us yet. Adal. Impossible! Lud. Nothing can make atonement for the shame He volunteers to suffer. Hild. Who can tell? Should he by chance or craft return to power, The foolish folk may weave it in his legend, And idolize the king who chose disgrace To save them from a batch of oligarchs. Thra. So will it work, unless . . . [chuckles.] Hild. Unless . . . Go on! Thra. Unless he were to dip his hands in blood. If once he wields the headsman's axe! Hild. By heaven! That puts him out of court! This very day He shall be notified to do his office. There is a famous robber now condemnedâ Thra. Yes, but a craftier way were to require Our princely headsman's duty on a friend, That he might show in full his loyalty To his new masters. Hild. Make him execute A friend of his? There he will halt, I think. Thra. And forfeit so his life. Hild. Which is our aim. Thra. Let me bring this to pass. A moment, friends. [goes out.] Lud. What will he do? Hild. Doubtless he means to yoke A private purpose with his patriotism. Lud. So statesmen work; an interest in the crop Makes ploughing easy. Adal. That's where the bishop fails: He takes a superficial artless view Of what's apparent. Hild. The complex heart of things Is never understood, till one is led To do wrong cheerfully that good may come. Re-enter Thrasimund with Saturnia, bound, and a Soldier carrying Saturnia's robe and crown. Thra. This is a woman who has lived too long. [places the crown on Saturnia's head, while the Soldier throws the robe round her.] You saw they were together when we came: I saw her seated in the scorner's chair, A Roman slave, a creature calling herself Queen of the Lombards. Hild. She it was who sowed Licence and levity in Urban's mind: It is as though I were beaten on the mouth To think she should be chosen before my daughter! Thra. Her most presumptuous treason and her life Of sin condemn her. Hild. And the law says death. Thra. God's law and man's! Hild. Are we agreed? Voices. Death! death! Thra. Hail, Queen of the Lombards! How do you like the fool? Sat. What have you done with Urban? Thra. He is dead. Sat. O cruel men! Did he not on his knees Entreat to see me? Thra. No; he killed himself. Sat. (straining her bonds). My hands are tied, or I would follow him! And did he leave no word? Thra. No; but be sure You'll see him when you come to die. Sat. May be; For love is stronger than the gates of death; And this I know, he loved me. Thra. (opening the door on her right). But his ghost, Remember, will be quaintly dressed in black, [Re-enter Urban in the headsman's dress, followed by Philadelphus.] Just like this apparition! Urb. Saturnia! [He has a premonition of what is coming.] Sat. It is my lord! They tortured me with lies! And I shall hear you say you love me! Hild. Headsman, Saturnia, mistress of the king dethroned, Queen of the Lombards by her own decree, To-day will expiate her spotted life; And you shall flesh your maiden axe in blood That beat with guilty passion for a fool. Get ready. Urb. (looks steadily at Hildebrand, then turns to Saturnia). They are subtler than I thought. This is the end, Saturnia. We must die. Sat. Together? Urb. Together. Hild. So, your headsmanship Was but a sorry ruse to purchase time. Urb. (to Saturnia). A desperate hope. This is the headsman's dress. Sat. Oh, my dear love! [closes her eyes and leans her head on his shoulder. The robe falls from her.] Urb. (to Philadelphus). You have your heart's desire, Philosopher. Hild. Will you be headsman? Phil. Yes, Since I may not be king. Hild. About it, then. Phil. The handsomest heads in Lombardy! A pair! He has my dress, though! Hild. No more toilets now! The dress is yours when you have earned it. Quick! [Philadelphus goes out.] Adalbert, come with me. We must in haste To the army and displace the Duke of Garda. (to Urban). No last appeal? No high reproof? No taunt? Thra. (to Urban and Saturnia). You keep your countenances still; but death Is downstairs, in the courtyardâthe axe, the block; By torchlight too! Some dozen heart-beats henceâ Count it in blood!âyou shall be lopped and spilt Upon the stones, as dead as carrion. I shall be there to mark your tears, your pallor. [All go out except Urban, Saturnia and Junipert.] Juni. Madam, if I could die for you! Sat. Alas! Urb. Your knife. Juni. Not that way! Urb. Fool! To cut her bonds. Juni. Ah, fool indeed, dreaming impossibles While this is in my power! [cuts Saturnia's bonds.] Sat. How can I thank you! I loved your poems, sir. I think of one Beginning, âDeath, the sweetest friend of man, Redeems the world.â . . . Yes, but I have my crown! [gives her crown to Junipert.] And if I had a kingdom it were yours For this rich freedom. [embraces Urban.] Juni. Madam, what must . . . [Urban presses Junipert's hand, and takes his dagger.] But . . . [Soldiers enter and Junipert is led out.] Sat. Say that you love me. Say it till they come. [As Urban speaks, Saturnia is gradually overpowered by fear.] Urb. I love you only. Empire, power, renown, Have passed away; time and the world are stripped To one sole heart of being, you and me. Let us not hope, not dream, but only live In this new ecstasy; or think how soon Together, undismayed, we two shall ford The shrouded stream that every soul must cross: [clasping her close.] And measure thus the moments, pulse by pulse, Till death shall make us one eternally. Sat. Yes, yes! But it is sickening to die With all our life unlived, our love unloved! Urb. Not all! not all! Remember purple hours When eager stars hung low to reach the earth; When through our open casement robber winds With pillage of the roses blew all night, And in your hair the scented spoil was caught. Sat. (frantically). Oh, Urban, save me! save me! Urb. Death will save us! A thousand lives rebel within me, bent On liberty and happinessâ Sat. My heart cries out for life and love. Urb. This travail means A world beyond the world; it heralds heaven; Establishes our immortality. Sat. But I am mad with fearâthe axe, the block, The hideous blow! [she breaks from him.] Oh! it is dark already! [shrilly.] Ah! I am falling, down below the grave Where devils writhe! Urb. (clasping her again). Hush! we shall fall asleep As soon as death has spread our bridal couch. How will you greet me when the morning comes? Sat. The morning? Urb. Yes; the morning after death. What will you say to me? Sat. Do you believe That we shall be together after death? Urb. For ever after death. Sat. And I shall be Your bride? Urb. My bride. What will you say to me? How will Saturnia greet me when we wake? Sat. Oh, I will greet you with a kiss, and say Good morning in the land beyond the grave! [A distant noise of arms is heard; then rapid footsteps.] Sat. Death comes! Urb. To open wide the door of life! [The noise becomes a tumult. Enter Hildebrand, running with his sword drawn; Thrasimund with a dagger; Adalbert and Ludolf unarmed. Hildebrand strikes at Urban as he passes through the room. Urban wards off the blow with his dagger and shelters himself behind the throne. Hildebrand is about to strike again, but the noise of shouts and fighting approaches rapidly, and he desists. In the mean time Thrasimund has got behind Urban.] Hild. (as he goes out). To-day the dice have fallen awry for me; But from Ravenna I will come in arms, And drag you from the throne you desecrate. Thra. (stabbing Urban). I'll jag him from it now! [runs out after Hildebrand.] Urb. Only a glance. [places Saturnia behind the open door.] Stand here, Saturnia. Here you will be safe From knaves and frantic blows. Gard. (calling from the Council-room). Urban! My lord! Urb. The Duke of Garda! I am king again! [Enter the Duke of Garda. Soldiers fill up the doorway.] The glorious world that death had swallowed up Rises about me like a thronging tide. I stand upon the summit: life begins Anew, heroic deeds and high renown! Gard. And your delivererâ [The Soldiers open a passage, and Osmunda enters, dishevelled and pale.] This heroine! Urb. (pressing his wound and speaking with difficulty). Osmunda! Osm. (to Garda). No, my lord! 'tis you have saved My husband's life. Sat. (stepping from behind the door). This is my husband; death united us. [Urban looks from Osmunda to Saturnia, from Saturnia to Osmunda; seems about to speak; staggers and falls.] Sat. (kneeling beside Urban). He is wounded! Thrasimund Poniarded him. Help me! [As the curtain falls Osmunda is staring at Saturnia, who supports Urban's head on her bosom.] THREE WEEKS ELAPSE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV Osmunda's Pomander Scene.âUrban's study in the Palace of Pavia. At the back a large two-leaved window, brushed by the branches of a tall lime tree. The window is draped. On the left, in a high and deep fireplace, a fire of wood burns. An oaken screen extends from the upper side of the fireplace, across a portion of the room. A curtain, on a rod joined to the screen, shuts off the fireplace except in front; but when the act opens this is folded back. In front of the screen, a couch and small table with reading-lamp. On the right is a table with documents and writing materials; beside it a large chair; against the wall a sideboard with glasses, etc. There are four alcoves in the wall, containing parchments, scrolls, etc.; and above the alcoves, niches with busts of Alexander the Great, CÃ¦sar, Hannibal, and Alboin. There are doors right and left; and an unseen entrance behind the screen. It is night when the act begins; the window is open; and the waning moon shines through the branches of the lime tree. Osmunda, worn out with nursing Urban, is lying on the couch. She has been reading, and has laid her book open on the table. The physician enters as the curtain rises. Osm. The king is dressing. Phy. What! Osm. He says he must. Phy. It means his life! Delirious strength will waste Him in an hour. His wound will recrudesce And suppurate. Why am I not obeyed? Osm. (rises). You have been obeyed. The king's delirium Is spent; his thought coherent; and his eyes, That roamed like ruined light, become again The sentinels of reason. Phy. Then he slept At last? Osm. I was beside him when he fell Asleep, my little Sybil in my arms. Which was the gentler sleeper, more at home In the benighted land of slumber, I Essayed in vain to tell. [steps are heard behind the screen.] Here is the king. I shall not see him unless he asks for me. [goes out.] Enter Urban, leaning on Pasqual's shoulder. He is haggard and weak. Phy. I trust your majesty, debating well Ability and inclination, found Your strength to rise equal to your desire: To leave your bed so soon is perilous. Urb. The peril is my own, the praise is yours If I resume the hardihood to risk Relapse; but I adventure nothing; weak [sits in the large chair.] As water, yet I feel the founts of life Break out again, with murmured prophesies Of dazzling days and nights of wonderment. I must have music! Bid the minstrels play. Phy. I shall instruct them. Music is the stalk And flower of health, and most remedial. [about to go.] Pasq. (whispering). He presses me for news. What shall I say? Phy. (whispering). Say all, judiciously. 'Twill fret him more To mark evasion than to know the worst. [goes out.] Urb. Three weeks, you say, at death's door. Pasq. I maintain The blade was poisoned. Urb. Oh, impossible! Pasq. But so inept a wound itself approached Your life no nearer than a thorn-prick would. Urb. I am sure there was no poison: simplest wounds That miss the first intention smoulder long. And now the news. Three weeks behind the times! The news! This unknown remnant of the past Is like a caul about me. Till I know The best and worst I am as one unborn Why do you not begin and tell me all? You said I must not think till I had strength To rise. I have risen. [Music is heard.] Ah! the minstrelsy! To such a melody a soul might sing In torment, smiling and at ease.âThe news! I have a sure presentiment of ill: Rehearse your story while the music lasts. Why are you silent? Where is Saturnia? Pasq. Saturnia? It was the queen who plucked You, bleeding, from a ring of thirsty swords, And with her tender and importunate care Recaptured for the world your fleeting life. Urb. She is a noble lady, certainly. Where is Saturnia? Pasq. I cannot tell. But I have baffling news of Lombardy. Saturnia's fate is insignificant. Urb. (starting from his seat). Saturnia's fate! What have you done with her? [crosses the room hastily and opens a door.] Give over there! The strings are raw; the tune Insane. [Music ceases suddenly.] What is her fate? Pasq. I cannot tell. Urb. You cannot tell? You mean that she is dead! Whoever dared to touch the life of her Who was to me the hallowed shrine of youth, Of love, of beauty, the ethereal part Of the world's delicacy, shall be killed By some new death of Eastern cruelty Exceeding fancy.âIs Saturnia dead? Pasq. I cannot tell. Urb. Who can? Who knows her fate? Answer me on your life. Pasq. The queen. Urb. The queen! A woman's vengeance. Bid her come to me. No; she shall be unprepared. [opens the door.] Desire the queenâ [Re-enter Osmunda.] Ah! you have overheard. Osm. No, as I live! I kept in call lest you should need my help. Urb. Give me your arm. Look at meâin the eyes. Where is Saturnia? Osm. In a nunnery. Urb. Not dead? Osm. Oh no! Urb. The convent of St. Ann's? [Osmunda assents.] Who placed her there? Osm. I did. Urb. Why did you so? Osm. In the name of justice, and for my own weal, And my daughter's. Urb. Yes. . . . Give order now For her release. Osm. I cannot. Urb. Cannot! Why? Osm. (to Pasqual). Have you not told? Pasq. He would not listen to me. Urb. I listen now. Pasq. Hildebrand and his gang Of malcontents fled to Ravenna. . . . [hesitates.] Urb. Well? Go on! These timorous delays are wounds Deeper than steel can trench. Say all; strike home. Pasq. To say it all it to strike home indeed! Lucian is King of Lombardy. Urb. Lucian! I understand you very well. I know. You say worse than the worst by the world's width To make the ill seem good. Pasq. I have said the truth. Lucian with allies of Ravenna, and all The Lombard rebels, overthrew your men, Followed the Duke of Garda to the gates Of Pavia, which he now besieges; took The royal title, and like a gamester sets A tempting price upon your head. Urb. A price Upon my head! How much? Pasq. Ten thousand crowns. Urb. My helmet cost me more!âBut is it true? Is Pavia besieged? Pasq. I said besieged; But our defeat is heavier than that: Pavia is taken. Nothing remains to us Except the palace. Urb. (rises, staggers, and clutches the screen). Nothing. Pasq. And our hearts. Urb. Once on a time the broad earth was my room. Between the curtains of the day and night I strode from east to west, and hourly held Communion with my great imaginings; And now this prison is the only space That's left me in a universe of worlds! A dying rat is happier in his hole! Had I a star to go to, even a waste Abandoned orb, that fallen spirits shun, My soul could live at ease. Nothing is mine Without my kingdom! [sinks on couch.âA knocking is heard.] Enter, herald! Cry The news that's knocking at my heart! Enter Philadelphus and Junipert. Junipert has been drinking, and walks unsteadily. He keeps behind Philadelphus. Phil. The king! Pasq. Why are you in the palace, Philadelphus? Phil. We came this morning, Junipert and I, The last to enter ere the gates were closed. I am playing cicerone to the poet.â Come, Junipert. The lobby was our way. Pasq. But why desert the winning side? Phil. Which side Is that, my lord? The palace will endure A three months' siege at least; and chance and change Are most empirical philosophers. Urb. (rises from the couch). Three months! Why, in three months I could create A kingdom! All is wellâbetter than well! These golden drops of time, good alchemist, Are the elixir of our immortal fame. Phil. Time is the elixir of all mundane things. Urb. I shall command in person. [crosses the room, maintaining with difficulty an erect carriage.] Pasq. You cannot go! Urb. (thrusting away Pasqual, who has offered help). I need no arm to lean on. I am king: Disease and death are subject to me. Come! To-night an onslaught in the dark shall sweep Our hasty rebels over Pavia's walls, Like blood-stained leaves before the whirling north. [goes out, followed anxiously by Osmunda and Pasqual. Junipert takes a leathern bottle from under his cloak and drinks. He lays the bottle on the window-sill, removes his cloak, and steps out on the ledge. Then he gets into the branches of the tree, shakes it, and peers down.] Phil. I'm not a gymnast! If you fall, remember, There's no one here to dive and fetch you up. Air is to breathe, not swim in. (to himself). Drunken ape! But something's in his head besides the wine. [Junipert tumbles into the room.] You have escaped! Then clearly you were born To die in bed. [Junipert gets up, secures his bottle, drinks from it, and hands it to Philadelphus, who replaces the stopper before putting it to his mouth.] Phil. This is the way to drinkâ The philosophic way. [seems to take a long pull.] Juni. Stupendous lungs! Stop, selfish drunkard! Phil. Oh, there's some left yet! [returns the bottle to Junipert.] Juni. I'll soon test that. [puts the bottle to his mouth, expecting only a few drops, and is almost choked. The wine pours over his face and clothes. He looks at, and into the bottle, mystified.] I drank the half of it; You drank the other half, and yet it seemed Half full and more just now! The devil's in it! [flings the bottle out of window.] Phil. It was, indeed, a bottle and a half! Juni. (sits in the chair). Sit, Philadelphusâhere in the chair beside me. [Philadelphus sits beside him.] You know I am a poet; now, a poet Is all things to all menâ Phil. No, Junipert. Juni. And nothing to himself. Phil. No, Junipert; That's the philosopher. Juni. Philosopher? But what I want to say I'm aiming at. True, I've been drinkingânot without a motive; Not for the sake of drinking, understand. No, my objective as a drunkard isâ Courage. Phil. What need have you for extra courage? Juni. I have invented a prodigious plot Which I am executing now. Phil. I see. Juni. Being what I am I need a confidant. Why should a man be burdened with a gift Of utterance if he's not to utter,âhey? Phil. Or with the gift of thirst and not to drink. Juni. Veracity intact! I'll write it down. [takes out his tablets and writes. Then turns over a leaf or two.] Here is the draft of it. Phil. Of what? Juni. The letter. Phil. What letter? Juni. Read itâread it out aloud. Phil. (reading from Junipert's tablets). âCome to me to-night. My heartâ . . . Who is the subscriber? (turns over a leaf). Osmunda!â âCome to me to-night. My heartâ my pride is broken. I suffer every misery a husband can inflict upon a wife he hates. I shall die long before the palace yields if I am not delivered from this hourly torture.â . . . What follows here, all interlined? Juni. (in vain endeavours to decipher his own writing). Minute Instructions how to enter by the tree At midnight. Phil. Yes, but who? Juni. Lucian, of course. I copied it in scripture feminine, And Lucian had it yesterday. I climbed Into the tree to try its wooden strength, Half hoping he might fall and break his neck: 'Twill bear him sober since it bore me drunk. So here I hide, and when he entersâplump, [taking a knife from his bosom.] This dagger's in his heart! Phil. Oh, well contrived! Juni. Poor Lucian dead, the rebels slink away; Osmunda's infidelity appears By my epistle; Urban divorces her, And marries his beloved Saturniaâ My muse and goddess who ascends the throne Across my lost soul, damn you, Philadelphus! Consummate plot! As certain as the dawn! Oho! the poet's always misconceived! The poet's eminently practical! [falls out of the chair and rolls over asleep.] Phil. Friend Junipert, your plot is beautiful; You forge and kill that she whom you adore May marry some one else. Most practical! Observe my plot now, the philosopher's. Oh, I've a plot! More intimate am I With this old palace, dungeon and battlement, Than all its deepest denizens, the rats, Or long-lived crows that whet their beaks above: Day in, day out, I searched it for a year. To-night, in secret, by a way I know, Enter, who?âHildebrand and Thrasimund! A philosophical conspiracy! You grant humanity consists of men? I am a man; so when I serve myself I serve humanity. To-morrow, freed By Urban's death, the Lombards toss their caps For despotism o'erthrownâhumanity In the abstract served by me; while I receive Ten thousand golden crownsâhumanity In substance served supremely by itself. I think my name is fixed in history now! (at the door). Help, here! Enter Soldier. Sol. What's this? Phil. You see. [Philadelphus and the Soldier raise Junipert.] Juni. Saturnia! [They take Junipert out between them.] Re-enter Urban, supported by the Duke of Garda and Pasqual, and followed by Osmunda. Urb. Here, on the couch. I am stronger than I seem. [lies down on the couch.] To-morrow I will head a sortie. Garda, The scheme of your defence is masterly. But go to bed: you have most need of rest. I too shall sleep an hour. Pasqual can watch; Then, I: so shall your mind have full repose. Good night. [Garda and Pasqual go out.] Osmunda. Osm. Yes. Urb. What is the hour? Osm. Midnight, or near it. Urb. Time to sleep. Good night. Sleepâyou must sleep. To-morrow we shall talk. [Osmunda is reluctant to leave him. She lifts the lamp as if to take it with her.] No; leave the light. [Osmunda replaces the lamp.] What were you reading? [takes up the book.] Ah! The life of Agis: genius against the world. Something of me, there; something of my fate. To-morrowâwe shall try to understand. [Osmunda goes out slowly.] Genius against the world. . . . I should have made Saturnia my wife. There was a gauntlet In the brazen face of custom! . . . But I feared . . . Is this my body's weakness? No; great men Betray no fault of instinct, no distress Of soul, no doubt of self in their infirmities: But here am I, confronted with my heart At last, a simpleton, maybe a knave! To laugh at policy, to over-ride Wisdom, authority, experience, To break with all the ragged past, and be The demiurge of order and a time Stamped with my imageâis to chafe Mankind, and mark my power and daring, carved In deep amazement and a world-wide frown, Is to read triumph in a storm of hate. But to espouse my mother's maid, a slave, Already mine, as everybody knew? Oh, no! the hero dreads a meaning smile, The lifted shoulder and the current jestâ âThe king? Our Urban? What can you expect? He took to wife his mistress!â There I am! There is the specious magnanimity That tossed away a fortune; impotence Pretending royal immunityâto lull The inward sting, and shirk the stress of life. I should have married her I love, because I love as lovers and as women love; No pastime, but my life. Then had my strength Been matched with loyal fate on equal terms; But having done dishonour to myself In the great passion by which the world endures, A bridge without a keystone, all my hopes Crumble to dust and vanish in the gulf. . . . To-morrow in the battle I can die. [sleeps.] Re-enter Osmunda. She looks about interrogatively; crosses to the couch and bends over Urban. Then she unfolds the curtain and sits on the chair. Lucian appears in the tree. Osm. He must have spoken in his sleep. [A clock strikes. She counts the hour listlessly.] One . . . twelve. [Lucian enters by the window. His appearance, manner, voice are now those of a man of resolution and hardihood. Osmunda utters a smothered scream on seeing Lucian, and signs to him to be silent. Lucian takes her hand and leads her to the window.] Urb. (dreaming.) A hideous blow! . . . Saturnia! Luc. (giving Osmunda a letter). It is not Your writing; but I came because a way Was shown me. Osm. (reading the letter.) Traitors in the palace! Luc. No; A deliverer! [puts his arm about her, and draws her nearer the window.] Osm. Lucian! so tyrannous! Luc. No way for me but to be tyrannous; 'Tis cowardly to say, âThus fate ordained!â Defeated men must fester in disgrace, Or cut their throats, or die contending still: I learnt that verdict in the bitter loss Of you: yet by a miracle I now Revoke it, and outroot the tangled wrong My vacillation wrought.âCome. Osm. (returning the letter). But you know This writing is not mine! Luc. It says the truth, Whoever wrote it. Oh, I heard the whole Iliad of misery; the petty spite, The indignities, the mortifying scorn Your husband deals you. Osm. Not one word is true! Luc. Your father told me all. Osm. He lied who said My husband scorned me. Luc. Then your father lied, And laced the lie with oaths.âYou love your husband? Do you love Urban? Urb. (dreaming). Her neck is like a lily. Luc. This is no time to stand on wooing terms! Answer directly. Did you marry Urban To please your father, or did your father lie In that confession too? Osm. That was no lie. Luc. You loved me when you married Urban? Speak! I was disloyal to myself and you. Were you unfaithful? Osm. (faintly). To myself and you. Luc. Then must we end this infamy, and break The prison of our love. Your father's roof Shall shelter you; and you shall be my wife, When I have dragged this Urban from his hold, And thrust him headless in unhallowed ground. [with one foot on the window-ledge, one hand on the tree, and the other on Osmunda's arm.] Fear nothing: 'tis the tree of life! Osm. (recoiling). No! no! Urb. (dreaming). Remember, headsman; together, with one stroke. [starts up awake; and, hearing Osmunda's voice, listens motionless.] Osm. Oh, Lucian, leave me to make up my mind Alone! My father's ill-used power compelled My spirit once; and now you and my love Drive me beyond myself. I must assure My heart, unmoved by the profound control Of yours beside me beating, that my choice To-night is my own will. Leave me alone. Luc. And if I do, how shall I know your choice? Osm. The windowâI shall open it again. Luc. But you have grown in power! . . . Decide alone. [goes out by the window, which Osmunda immediately closes. She then fills a glass with water, places it on the table, and drops into it the poison from her pomander, which, after dissolving, leaves the water colourless. Urban watches her.] Osm. This is the choiceâmy husband, death, or love. Not life; I thought I chose that once, but found Only a husband: women have no life. I was, I am my husband's: shall I pass From one man to another like a slave That must belong to somebody? Blind love Would have me Lucian's: were Lucian by my side I could not bid him go again without me! That was a conquest! [raises the glass.] And should I so decide This will maintain my victory over love! [replaces the glass; sits.] Now, let me choose. My husband, death, or love? [rises slowly; crosses the room, and lays her hand on the curtain. Urban keeps out of sight.] I will not, dare not leave this beaten man; Conspire his downfall, triumph in his death, And reign his conqueror's bride. Here lies my fate, My woman's duty; here, my peace of mind! [flings the curtain aside and starts back with a cry on seeing Urban.] Urb. What poison's this? What tragedy, bestowed And slumbering in your marriage-bed, awakes Uncoils and wonders where to strike? How long Has death been consort of your thoughts? I deemed You still the tender woman men are taught To prize most for a mate; whose love takes heart With marriage only; and whose child acquits The pensive shame that haunts her sweet desires. Osm. The woman never jealous, who forgives The unrepentant, loves the sinner more; The fabulous sweet monster men solace Their self-conceit with! There are none such, Urban! I, least of all, approach the inhuman thing Your fancy fondled. . . . Shall I say it all? Urb. Though it should flay my soul. Osm. (handling her pomander). This venom, fetched By castaways from shores beyond the dawn Where all the region is a labyrinth Of wonders, Hildebrand gave to his wife Upon her wedding-morn; for then the fate Of Lombard women shook in the rough scales Of war. My mother passed the gift to me; And at my girdle it has always hung, A treasured keepsake and the shrine of death. At your election when you donned the crown, And spoke your well-considered speech, I grasped This fragrant casket, and beheld myself Dead in my smooth and stainless wedding-sheets, A virgin bride beyond the bridegroom's power To waken with a whisper. Lucian's love And mine seemed greater than the world, than life, Power and the name of queen; marriage with you, Warm from a harlot's bedâa common shame That women undergoâappeared as foul As to be shackled to a leper maimed And mildewed with his malady. And yet I was so weak I did not dare to die. Urb. So strong, I think.âYou hid your hate of me? Osm. It vanished with your kisses, Urban. Why Are we poor women made so! Urb. That the world May never cease.âYou learned to love me then? Osm. I thought so; you were gentle and abashed; Observed my moods; and so devoutly begged Where you might take, that with my body soon I worshipped you. How could I help it, Urban? Urb. But it was not love? Osm. No; not like my love For Lucianânow, I know. Urb. How came he here? Osm. I scarcely understand. Not with my will! Urban! You cannot thinkâ Urb. Nothing of you I think except divinely. Enter Nurse from behind the screen. Osm. What do you want? Nurse. I'm sure the child's bewitched; It tosses, sobs, and knits its brows and stares. [Osmunda motions her away.] You bade me call you if it would not rest. Urb. Go to our child. Osm. And come again to you When she has fallen asleep? Urb. Yes, come to me. [Osmunda and the Nurse go out. Urban, fascinated by the poison, raises the glass.] Was this poured out for me? A draught of death, The only true elixir! I have filled The land with woeâcarnage, and fire and mourning; And for a dream troubled the lives of women Who gave me love and duty! That I, who left My foes unwatched, and made a laughing-stock Of him I should have won at any cost, Or promptly killedâ [laughs ruefully.] That I must set about To reconstruct the world!âIf I drink this It shall appear I overtaxed my strength And died expectedly. . . . [takes a glass from the sideboard; pours water into it, and places it instead of the poisoned one.] She must not know, were I to do this thing. . . . [opens the window.] That was her signal. Lucian. . . . What is best? Saturnia. . . . I must not think of her. [is standing behind the leaf of the window, looking at the glass against the light. Lucian, re-entering by the window, thrusts the leaf against Urban's arm, and the glass falls. Lucian does not hear the crash, as his sword clanks on the window-sill; he goes a few steps into the room, and meets Osmunda, who re-enters from behind the screen, alarmed by the noise.] Luc. Osmunda, mine in love and deed! Osm. No! No! Luc. Why is your window open? You shall not Repent! Osm. I did not open it. But where Is Urban? Have you killed him? Urb. (stepping from the window). I am here. Luc. Mine, and the world's rash enemy! Urb. The world Will never beat a better-tempered foe. [Lucian attacks. Urban is powerless to resist him.] Osm. Lucian! For shame! Look, he can hardly stand. Re-enter Philadelphus ushering Hildebrand, Thrasimund, Ludolf, Adalbert, Lords and Soldiers. Except Philadelphus, all stare astonished at Lucian, who is equally surprised. Voices. The king! Urb. (under his breath). The king. Luc. What mystery is this? Phil. I know the origin of both your wonders. Thra. That can be told again. Now, Lombards, strike For liberty! [Urban is attacked.] Osm. (hanging on Hildebrand's arm). Oh, father, spare his life! Hild. (flinging Osmunda aside). I have no child until his blood be shed. Osm. No child! [lifts the glass and holds it up. All look at her inquiringly.] This is my weapon! I hold a poison here That kills like lightning. If one blow be struck I drink and die. (to Lucian). Give me my husband's life! Urb. Oh tenderest conscience, there your poison lies! [points to the broken glass and then to that in her hand.] That is as innocent as your fail soulâ Think what you please. Have at me! This is best! I shall die fighting with my back to the wall. [Urban is again attacked, and his sword struck from his hand at once. He steps forward to meet their points. Osmunda, desperate, drags Lucian between Urban and the Lords.] Osm. Save him! save him! Luc. But he wishes death. Osm. He is ill and weak; he left his bed to-day Against all counsel. (on her knees). Lucian, save my husband. Luc. Stand back! [All the Lords fall back except Hildebrand.] Stand back! [Hildebrand also steps back.] I spare your husband's life If you consent never to see him more. Osm. (still on her knees). I . . . Luc. Silence! Yes or no is life or death. Osm. (faintly). Yes. [rises, watching Urban intently.] Hild. (fiercely). Then there is no peace in Lombardy! Luc. The peace of Lombardy shall be secured By Urban's exile. Urb. (mournfully). Exile! [sees his sword on the ground, and with a joyful cry stoops for it; but Osmunda picks it up before he can reach it.] Osm. You must live! Urb. (looks fixedly at Osmunda. Then including Lucian and Hildebrand in a haughty glance). The world is wide. Beyond the Adrian sea I'll carve an eastern kingdom for myself. TWENTY YEARS ELAPSE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V Nil Nisi Bonum Scene.âSt. Michael's Square, Pavia. A narrow street of lofty houses enters the square at the back of the stage. The Royal Palace is on the right of the square; on the left the Church of St. Michael with lofty porch. Near the centre of the square is a veiled statue. From the door of the Royal Palace a draped gangway leads to a platform beside the statue. Steps ascend to the platform in front and behind. The houses in the square and in the street are decorated with flags, banners and garlands. Two streets enter the square on either side. It is summer time, about an hour after noon. When the curtain rises the platform is guarded by soldiers, a crowd is entering leisurely from all sides, the people are taking their places at the windows. From the back a Vinedresser, a Shepherd carrying his crook, and a Blacksmith with a leather bag, rush down to the front where a street enters on the right. Vine. This is the stand! Shep. Ay, here they pass in throngs. Black. (holding out the bag to the people entering). Money, money! hand it out! Golden crowns or copper groats! Though we're poor our hearts are stout, The Three. And our stomachs and our throats. Merc. (giving money). What lusty lungs! You're sorry rogues, I fear. Black. Your humble servants, sir! Servants of all Exalted citizens who can themselves Be merry, and who think it sin to see A poor man sober on a day like this. [singly and in groups people enter, and most of them contribute.] Enter Urban by a street on the left. His beard and hair are white, his cheeks sunken, his eyes hollow. He is dressed like a beggar with wallet and staff. No one regards him and he heeds no one. He looks at the statue indifferently; at the Palace long and earnestly. Then he seeks a place to rest, and at last, by permission of one of the soldiers, sits on the steps to the gangway. He takes from his wallet a crust of bread and uncovers his head. Urb. Our daily bread! Remember, âYou must live.â Enter Junipert, old, dishevelled, dressed as in the first act, but with some incongruous attempts at finery, and a conspicuous rent or two in his cloak. Shep. Golden crowns, or copper groats! Juni. (feeling his pockets). I had . . . why, gentlemen, no greater joy . . . Ah, here! I've chased it home. Drink the Queen's health, Queen Sybil. Yes, I knew her father well. Black. You knew King Urban? Juni. Did I? I was there When Urban donned the headsman's dress to change The luck of Lombardy. Black. (looking closely at Junipert). Youâlet me see: For twenty years, horseman and footman, rich And poor, I've known in Pavia every face. Why, you are Junipert, the ballad-monger! Where have you been this many and many a year? Juni. Ill, sir. But not to-day. I would have rent My grave to see King Urban's brat unveil Her father's statue; and I meant besides To toss my old cap at her coronation; But that was past my strength. Have you been there? Black. And back again, not half an hour ago. [giving Junipert money.] Take it, man! Not a mite; no, not from you! Our old cloak must be clouted against the winter. In your own way, you are a craftsman too, And pipers don't pay fiddlers. Juni. Poverty, By right of proverb, parts good company; Butâ The Three. Though we're poor our hearts are stout, And our stomachs and our throats. Enter Philadelphus, hardly older in appearance, handsomely dressed. Phil. Money? I give it only when it's earned. Shep. (catching Philadelphus by the neck with his crook). Come, come! Pay toll, old grumbler. Phil. Nasty villains! You fail in common sense; it's ruinous For able-bodied men to beg in public. Black. Pay, pay! Phil. As a philosopher, I pay; But as a man, I . . . [gives money.] Juni. Well, old enemy. Phil. Above ground still! What savoury salt preserves So frail a body and so light a mind? Juni. Still hypercritical! I'm kept alive By sheer sincerity, which often saves More sinful limbs and scantier brains than mine. Phil. Sincerity? a wanton-virtuous word; A pitiful petitionary word; A mere excuse! I'll tell you what it is: It's crass stupidity; a strength of mind; A root of character that grows the fool, The beggar and the outcast. Poetry, Divine sincerity, is undeveloped Craftiness, intelligence in the rough. And I maintain that as sincerity Is to stupidity, so intelligence Must always be to insincerity. There, the philosopher's golden rule of three! Black. You prating liar! [flings a coin in Philadelphus's face.] Take your dross again! We've no blood-drinkers here! Vine. Blood money! How? Black. Look at him! Know him yet? That's Philadelphus. Shep. What! Him that sold King Urban? Phil. An ancient story! Black. But we remember it to-day! Phil. Good fellowsâ Voices. Hi! Beat him; stone him; strip him; hang him, dog! [Philadelphus runs out, pursued by the crowd.] Juni. Fate of philosophy! Poetic justice! Urb. (approaching Junipert). Is this some kind of masqueâsome play? Juni. A play? Urb. You spoke of SybilâQueen Sybil. Who is she? Juni. The daughter of our Lombard hero, Urban. Now, where have you been gathering ignorance? Urb. I came across the world to die at home. Juni. To die! Not yet a while! Urb. But this is Pavia? Juni. The very Pavia Urban lovedâmy friend, King Urban. Urb. Who are you? Juni. One Junipert. I was King Urban's friend, and laureate To the divine Saturnia. Urb. What?âwho? Juni. She that is now the Abbess of St. Anne's, The wealthiest nun in Lombardy; you know King Urban gave her half his patrimony. I have a treasure hidden in my houseâ A crown she gave me once, a golden crown. Urb. And Lucian? Juni. Lucian! Five years beneath the sod. You are a stranger! Urb. I forsook this land Long before Lucian's death. Juni. Then you must know That Lucian died of disappointment; nibbled To death by slow chagrin, the Lombards think, Because Osmunda would never marry him. Urb. She would not marry him. Juni. Osmunda would not. Urb. Osmunda. Juni. Yes; she died a year ago. Urb. Osmunda died. Juni. Osmunda, Urban's wife. Her latter days were happy.âPeople say Urban himself is dead; but I believe He sleeps somewhere enchanted in the east. Mark me; our army starts to-day to fight The conquering FranksâOh, these are high-strung times! Well, if you live it out, you'll hear of this, Or I'm no prophet. When the battle bends Against us, and the Lombard banners droop, Upon a warhorse, thundershod, behold In burning mail, a godlike champion, Whose single arm shall stem discomfitureâ Urban, come back again! Urb. Come back again. Juni. Well, as I told you, Lucian in the grave, Old Hildebrandâ Urb. Hildebrand! Thrasimund! Juni. Thrasimund! Worm's meat ages since! His wife Married a ruffling knave who ruined her.â So Hildebrand, the toughest statesman known, He named his grandchild queen, and crowns her now, War being at our doors, to give the state Stability. With filial tenderness She on her coronation day unveils This statue of her father, Urban the Great. Urb. Urban the Great. [The door of the Palace is thrown open, and Trumpeters enter, sounding a flourish. Urban hangs inertly on his staff, then seeking support, leans in the angle between the platform and the steps. At the sound of the trumpets the crowd pours into the square, the windows fill with spectators, and a number of men climb to the top of the church porch. The Royal Procession then enters from the Palace, including Hildebrand, very old and withered, but still erect; Almeric, Ulric, Pasqual, and the Duke of Garda, now arrived at middle age; Sybil wearing the iron crown of Lombardy, her royal train borne by pages, and attended by ladies, and by Saturnia in the dress of an abbess, and two nuns. Sybil pauses as she crosses the threshold of the Palace, and the crowd bursts into a roar of welcome. Urban staggers out of the corner, and shading his eyes with his hand, looks at his daughter. His intelligence quickens; he moves towards her. Soldiers attempt to intercept him. Struggling with them mechanically, he endeavours to reach the gangway.] Syb. (impulsively to the Soldiers). Oh, let the old man be; he seems wayworn. Voices. Long live the queen! Juni. Heaven help her tender heart! [With the exception of Sybil, Saturnia, Hildebrand, the Duke of Garda, and one or two ladies, the members of the Royal party descend to a portion of the square, in front of the platform reserved for them. Urban, Junipert, the Blacksmith, the Shepherd, and the Vinedresser, with a few others, are pressed by the throng into this reserved space. Hild. May it please your majesty. My lords, and folk Of all degrees, when we in wrath expelled The world-embracing aim, the patient love Of all things human, and the mastery Of men and motives that in Urban formed A power, prevailing now more than the whole Precedent fame of our unconquered race, We blindly wrought the heaviest sin that time Has yet recorded against Lombardy. To-day repairs as far as afterthought Can make amends for past misdeeds, the ill We did ourselves and him. His soul is young Again in our young queen; his prophecy Directs our arms though late; and in the midst Of Pavia, his image shall remain, A public inspiration, as in our hearts The poignant savour of his memory dwells. Urb. (to himself). Old Hildebrand. [Sybil unveils the statue.] Voices. God save the queen! Syb. My people, [pointing to the statue], He is your captain, and through me he speaks Once more the message none who heard believed, Though all remembered it because the words Were branded on their hearts. My father said, Appealing for his life: âWe must be first, Though everlasting war cement each course Of empire with our blood; or cease to be, Our very name and language in dispute.â Help me, my father, lest I break down and weep!â That which he bade the Lombards do, the Franks Have done; and we against their empire fight For power, for life itself. We have a soldier Worthy to lead the Lombardsâmy father's friend; [gives her hand to Garda.] I say to you, âBe great, and make us great!â Oh, I have garnered all my father's words, And wear them like a rosary in my thought. He said, and reverently I say it tooâ âI am become this land, this Lombardy, With famous cities zoned from sea to sea, From Alp to Apennine; and in my heart The Lombards have their homeâthe quick, the dead; The ancient story, and the flying days, We'll fill with noble deeds!â Voices. God save the queen! [While his daughter speaks Urban gradually acquires a proud attitude like that of his statue.] Voice. Saturnia! 2nd Voice. Ay, ay, Saturnia! [Urban shrinks into himself.] A Man (rising suddenly on the top of the church porch). Yes; some of us keep things in mind. It's well To have a hero; and we need one too! But who can worship him who cast aside His noble wife; and, when his enterprise Was ripe for action, wantoned time away In masques and childish tricks and revelry? [The Man sinks down immediately and is not seen again.] Black. That's a bold fellow. Why, he's gone already! (to Urban). Father, this Urban had his faults and flaws. Urb. He had one fault. Black. One only? What was that? Urb. Himself. Shep. Right! Something nibbled at the root. Vine. All said and done, a wolf among the flock. Urb. She leads a holy lifeâSaturnia? Black. Ay, now she leads a holy life. Voices. The queen! Syb. (having spoken with Saturnia). You call on one who is most dear to me. My mother in her agony when death Became impatient, and she too, longed to go, Accepted not the hand that beckoned her Till she had seen Saturnia. Then these two Forgave each other silently with tears, For neither found an apter eloquence To spend the treasure of their burdened hearts. And since that time I know no closer friend Than she who now will wind the tangle up Of that old lie no honest heart believed. Voices. Saturnia! The Abbess! Hear the Abbess! Sat. It is to clear King Urban's fame I speak. [Urban listens with bent head.] Her gracious majesty, Queen Sybil, knows Her father's reign was spotless. Not more true To Lombardy than to his marriage vow, By day or night, he never sought me once; Nor met me; nor with any deed or gift Approached my memory. The guilt was mine: I, unrepentant, desperate, sent him word, And plausibly secured an audience; Where he rebuked me, even when my craft of love That had ensnared my own desire, intrigued Most cunningly for his. Relentless foes Interpreted our meeting impiously; But I would have the whole world know at last, Although my name be therefore held in scorn, That he was loftier than menâin love, In triumph, in defeat, a deity. Urb. (crying out). No! No! Hild. What now? Soldier. My lord, the vagabond The queen protected. Syb. Would he speak with me? Urb. Come nearerânearer yet. [Sybil comes to the verge of the platform immediately above Urban.] Whose child are you? Your father's imageâso the flatterers say? Hild. Off with him! Scourge him! Syb. Gently, Hildebrand.â They say I have my father's look and poise. Urb. Osmunda's mouth; and that's a gracious gift. Syb. You knew my father? Urb. I knew himâimpotent, In poverty, alone; an exile gnawed Remorselessly by dogged memories. Discrowned and hopeless, like a star unsphered He sank beneath the nadir to the abyss And noisome dregs of being, with the madman, The outlaw and the rat, ere Lombardy Had well begun to wonder at his fall. Pasq. Insane old man! He had the highest heart That ever beat with life. Urb. I doubt it not; But that was broken. For his head, 'twas warped With waste ambition; and he saw the world Misshapen like a semblance in a pool The wind perturbs. He that was stuck by chance A flaunting feather in the age's cap, Essayed to be the sword of destiny, And with the dust and straw was swept aside, A bitten quill used once to write a name. Pasq. Ignoble, envious wretch! Voices. Pluck out his tongue! Trample him in the dirt! Tear him in bits! [Urban is set upon and maltreated by the crowd.] Syb. Deliver him! No blood must stain to-day! [Soldiers rescue Urban from the crowd. He is unconscious and bleeding.] Sat. They've mauled him pitilessly. Come down with me. [Saturnia and the Nuns assist Urban.] Gard. Slanders die hard, but here has one been killed By a brave woman. As for this new lie Of Urban's life in exile, I can count A score at least before it, spread abroad By beggars, palmers, jugglers, mountebanks, All circumstantial, opportunely launched To startle fancy, or elicit alms; All equally authentic.âForward there, Or time will beat us.âMadam, your soldiers wait To greet King Urban's daughter and their queen. Syb. Lead on, my father's friend! Gard. To victory! King Urban's spirit shall triumph in our arms. [The Royal procession descends from the platform by the steps behind, and goes out accompanied and followed by the cheering crowd. The spectators leave the windows, and Saturnia and the Nuns are left with Urban.] Sat. (supporting Urban's head). He lives. Go quickly and prepare a room. [The Nuns go out.] Urb. (opening his eyes). Saturnia! [Saturnia draws away from him; but looking again into his eyes she recognizes him, and with a low cry hear head sinks beside his. A passage of triumphal music is heard in the distance. Urban gets up on his knees, and listens eagerly, one hand on the ground, the other on Saturnia's shoulder.] Urb. The war is over now! My daughter, Sybil, Queen of the Lombards, rides Victorious into Pavia.âAsk me not What I have been! My life went swiftly down Beneath the harrow: I came home to die; Let no one know; bury me in your heart. [The music comes nearer.] My daughter Sybil rides victoriously! The gates of death are open! Have no fear! How will Saturnia greet me when we wake? Sat. Oh, I will greet you with a kiss and say Good morning in the land beyond the grave! Urb. Where is that lying fellow on the porch? Urban was nobleâdo you hear?âand great. Take this from me: Learn to forgive yourself; Though you were Judas, learn to forgive yourself.â Saturnia, help me up! [Saturnia helps him to his feet.] I cannot die Beneath the harrow nailed into the earth. I would . . . die . . . standing. [His head falls on Saturnia's shoulder, and he dies.] Enter, crossing the street at the back, the van of the Lombard army with the crowd shouting joyfully. THE END</field>
