      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Herodian. Alcanor. Barzilla. Halak. Sameas. Serapion, an Egyptian Slave. Affghar, an Arab. Augusta. Mariamne. Glaphyra.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Night. The Entrance of a Prison. Augusta enters, attended by Sameas, with a Guard bearing Torches. Aug. Advance your torches to the dungeon's mouthâ And is it here my beauteous rival dwells? Is it within these melancholy walls That Mariamne, Herod's matchless queen, Once the bright wonder of the gazing world, Ambition's victim, now despairing pines? Sam. Such was the will of Herod, and, though dead, Yet, whilst his stern decree stands unrevok'd, Here she must dwell, nor view the light of heaven, Till mercy beams upon her. Aug. I would see How gracefully the heroine wears her chains: Twice seven long years she triumph'd on my throne. I would fain see, if those all-conquering eyes, Whose fires extinguish'd mine, maintain their lustre. Sam. Is this a triumph worthy of Augusta? What joy can it reflect on Judah's queen To mark the faded cheek, the languid eye, And trace the furrows of corroding grief In that fair face, whence every charm is fled? Aug. If there be comfort to a wounded spirit In a proud rival's fall, give my revenge What name you may, it must be nature still: Therefore no more, but lead me to the dungeon. Sam. Herod is laid in earth, your princely son Is destin'd to possess JudÃ¦a's throne; Rome crowns your wishes, fortune smiles upon you; But, if your happiness is not complete, Until contrasted with the gloomy scene That here awaits you, enter, and enjoy All the delights that horror can bestow. [They enter the prison. Halak enters, followed by Herodian. Her. Stop, venerable stranger, and be pleas'd In courtesy to tell me, if 'tis here, Within this gloomy mansion, that your queen, The royal Mariamne, is imprison'd. Hal. Sir, though in prudence I might stand excus'd From a reply, I shall not treat your question With that contempt; nor you with such mistrustâ 'Tis here that Mariamne is imprison'd. Her. Oh, heav'n and earth!âbut sure, or I mistake, Or in those features, spite of all the change, That time has wrought, my memory still can trace An ancient valued friendâAre you not Halak? Hal. I am, and if my old eyes don't betray me, I now behold Herodian, and the son Of that dear saint, whom these dark cells entomb. Her. I am Herodianâthis full heart can witness I am the son of that ill-fated mother, And the excluded heir of Judah's throne. Hal. Thou art the heir; the covenant of heaven Is with the house of DavidâOh, my prince, Let me embrace thy kneesâ Her. Rise, rise and say If I may enter here, and vent my sorrows On that maternal bosom, where I hung In helpless infancyâOh, what is nature, If son forgets the mother, that has fed him? Hal. Alas, my prince, if here you seek to enter, The walls shall answer to your suit, as soon As those who guard them; fruitless were the time, And full of danger, spent in that attempt: Better it were, in this important crisis, To seek those loyal friends, whose sage advice Might guide your counsels, and protect your person, Or e'er your brother, slave-born, base Alcanor, From his Arabian desarts shall return, As shagged Esau from his chase of old, And claim an elder birthright. Her. Will heaven suffer That exil'd Ishmaelite to reign in Judah, And let the bondman lord it o'er the free? Hal. Alas, the will of CÃ¦sar is our law. What is JudÃ¦a, what is all the world But one vast province of imperial Rome? And though I doubt not but our Sanhedrim Would, with once voice, decree the throne to you, Yet now, so venal are the Roman tyrants, Line but an Ãthiop's sooty hand with gold, And he shall buy the diadem of Herod. Her. Where is the record of my elder claim? Unjust and cruel as my father was To the unhappy tenant of that dungeon, Yet I must think, he never would prefer Augusta's Idumean son to me, A prince descended from the loins of David. Hal. So swift, so instant was the mortal shaft, That struck your father's heart, death gave no warning, But sprung at once with fury on his victim, As 'twere his purpose to preclude repentance. Her. Horrible consummation!âWere you present? If so, relate the manner. Hal. Words would fail me; The feelings of a son could ill endure it. High on his throne he sate in regal state, His proud heart swelling, whilst applauding crowds, With impious acclamation, criedâA God! A present God!âWhen on the word behold! Down fell this idol god, gasping, convuls'd, With dreadful agonies, down from his throne Death-struck he fell, and lay outstretch'd, a corpse Welt'ring in blood, too terrible for sight. Her. It was the hand of heav'nâthere lies the sin; There dwells the cause, that drew this judgment down; It was the wailing of my wretched mother In bitterness of soul, that cried against him; It was the spirit of that hermit-saint, Whose sacred blood bedew'd these impious walls, That his dissever'd head might grace the revels Of a lewd capering minstrelâHe it was, That, from the quiver of unerring death, His swiftest arrow drew, and bade him strike. Sameas comes forth from the prison. Sam. Guards, to your posts! Whoe'er you are, withdraw, And stand at distance till the queen has pass'd! Her. Oh, my foreboding heart! Hal. No more: retire! This cloister will conceal usâNay, be quick! [Halak and Herodian withdraw. Augusta comes forth with Attendants. Sam. Well, royal lady, you have seen your prisonerâ And let me hope, the pitiable sight Has mov'd your heart to mitigate her sufferings. Aug. Sameas, I rather should have thought your office Was more concern'd with justice than with pity; But I perceive Herod mistook your nature, When he impos'd this cruel task on one, Whose yielding heart is turn'd with every tear, That a fair woman sheds. Sam. I can be firm, Though not unfeeling: you have seen the dungeon, In which the wreck of all, that once was great, And beautiful, and happy, is ingulf'd: There was no preparation on our part; Your visit was unlook'd for: did you find One secret solace in that dismal dwelling, One ray of light, by charitable stealth, Let in to cheer the darkling wretch within it? If in your vengeance you could reap delight, From contemplation of a suffering creature In the last stage of misery, sure I am You have enjoy'd that transport in perfection. Aug. How else should perishable nature stand A siege of woes, so numberless as mine, If dreams of dear revenge, and one faint spark Of hope still glimmering through the dreary void, Had not upheld me? Six years I had reign'd In Herod's heart, his consort and a queen; When Mariamne's arts seduc'd him from me: Me he repudiates, and espouses herâ Nor is this allâShe rises in her power, And, unrelenting, bars me in a prison For twice sev'n yearsâMy infant son meanwhile Driv'n to Arabia's desertsâWhat are wrongs, If these are not? Sam. In their full force I own them, I feel them to be wrongs, and do admit, Not to retaliate injuries like these Would be an instance of such rare forbearance, A virtue so sublime, as few have reach'd. Aug. Yet, sure I had some sense of that forbearance, When as I enter'd, and in silence stood Contemplating her melancholy state, The tear of pity trickled down my cheek, And all the woman rush'd into my heart: The glimmering lamp shone faintly on her face, And ghastly pale it seem'dâAdvancing then I was about to speak, when lifting up Her heavy eyes, she fix'd a look upon me, That chok'd my swelling throat, and stopp'd my speech. Sam. Ah, who that so can picture human woes, And had the power, would want the will to heal them? Aug. What would you have me do? Sam. Would it be much, If you indulge her with the common blessingsâ Air, and the light of heaven? Aug. Let her enjoy them. I grant your suit for both. Sam. Herod is dead; What danger can accrue, if, to relieve Her solitary hours, some gentle friend Were suffer'd to approach herâ'Twould be cheering, And with my life I'll answer for her safe-guard. Aug. On that condition, be it as you wish! Sam. Humbly I give you thanks. I've been importunate, But mercy is the brightest ornament That royalty can wear. Serapion enters, and kneels to Augusta. Ser. Hail, gracious queen, Imperial lady, I have joyful tidings; Your princely son Alcanor is arriv'd In health and safety. Aug. Hah, my son, my sonâ Saw you the princeâComes good Barzilla with him? Ser. I saw him enter CÃ¦sarea's gates, Barzilla by his side; his Arab guard On their fleet coursers rang'd, their lances couch'd, In moony phalanx follow'dâ'Twas a sight To draw all eyes upon themâ Aug. Is he comely, Gallant, and graceful? Doth he wear a look High and beseeming of his royal birth? Ser. All that your heart can wish Alcanor is. Sam. There, now you see the blessed fruits of mercyâ How quick the recompense succeeds the act. Aug. Yes, Sameas, now the bright'ning prospect cheers me, Now the sun smiles, the land in view looks joyful, And happily we ride before the gale, O'er swelling seas with full and fav'ring tide, Into the haven of prosperityâ Sameas, farewell! Be watchful of your prisoner, But temper caution with what grace you may. [Exit attended. Halak brings Herodian forth. Hal. You may come forthâShe's gone. Sam. Stand!âWho are these? Whence come you, and how dare you here intrude, On this forbidden ground?âHalak! Amazement! Hal. Regard us not as spiesâWe are in truth Lovers of mercy, and as such your friends. Sam. Why did you hide yourselves within that cloister? Was it to listen to our conference? Hal. Not for that purposeâyet I own we heard it. Her. We heardâthe son of Mariamne heard Your intercession for his suffering mother, And will record it in his grateful heart, So long as life and memory are vouchsaf'd him. Sam. The son of Mariamne! Can it be? Halak, you should be honestâIs this so? In solemn truth declare! Hal. You know me well; No conscious falsehood ever stain'd my lips: In very truth, the rightful heir of Herod, The son of Mariamne, stands before you. Sam. With soul affianc'd to his sacred right, I pay my homage on my bended knee. Her. Had I the pow'r, I'd bid thee rise to honour, But take my thanksâ'Tis all I can bestow. Sam. Prince, have you fortitude to meet the sight, That I can shew youâyour imprison'd mother? Her. I have; I feel that heav'n will give me strength To kneel and ask a blessingâ Sam. Oh, forbear; You must not speak to her, you must stand off At distance, where her feeble sight can't reach you. This is my counsel, prince, and in regard Of your mind's peace, I urge you to observe it. Now, Halak, mark meâFrom this door she'll issue, And when I give the signal of her coming, Draw off and stand apart. [Enters the prison. Her. Ah, my good friend, He must know little of the human heart, Who thus requires me to control its feelings. Hal. Yet t'would be well to arm yourself, my prince, With as much constancy as you can summon. Her. I'm fully arm'dâbut what can fence off nature? Had heaven decreed me to a private station, I might have seen my parents, full of years, Yield their last breath, and close their eyes in peace; That had been triumph in the conscious trust Of their election to a happier state: But what is now my lot? A father there, Venting his impious vaunts, struck down by heaven, A god this moment, and the next a corpseâ Here, at the dungeon's mouth, the living tomb Of an imprison'd mother, whilst I stand, Waiting the ghastly vision to appear, Where is the son, who, in a scene like this, If he has human feelings, can foreknow Where passion may transport him the next moment? Uphold me, heaven! She comesâHe gives the signal. Hal. Here, here! this over-hanging roof will hide usâ Her. No, I'll not stirâSpell-bound, I'm rooted here. Sameas leads Mariamne from the Prison. Sam. Fear nothingâwe are now without the walls; A little further on you'll meet the breeze! 'Tis now the evening hour, when the pale shades Of near approaching night have melted down Day's gaudy tints, for sight like yours too strongâ Lift up your eyes, and tell me what you see. Mar. Nothing distinctly: all is mist around me: But I perceive a stream of air so subtle, It penetrates each pore, and though I shrink, As if immers'd in water, it revives me. Whom must I thank for this? Sam. The queen permits it, In pity for your sufferings. Mar. Has she pity? Is it not rather you that have persuasion? You have a feeling heart, and many a time, When you have brought me food, I have look'd up, And, by the lamp's pale light, have seen the tear Drop on the bread you gave meâOh, that drop Made sacred what it fell on, and methought, Whilst there was one kind heart that pitied me, Life was not totally bereft of comfort. Her. Halak, give way! I can refrain no longer. Mar. What voice is that? I heard the name of Halakâ Sam. Lo, he is present! Mar. Let me hear him speak. Hal. My ever-honour'd mistress, I am Halak, Your poor old servant, who has never fail'd To visit this sad mansion day by day, Sueing for leave to pay his mournful dutyâ But all in vainâ Mar. Yes, yes, the voice is Halak's; My ear is faithful to its friendly tonesâ Your goodness too I know, worthiest of men, And now my eyes recover their lost function, And I can see youâOh this, this is comfort!â I see another there, I see a form Familiar to my dreams, a kind of spirit, Which in the midnight horrors of my cell, When all was dark around me, self-illumin'd, As the blest angels are, has beam'd upon me, In likeness of a sonâ Her. That son is present, And, kneeling at your feet, implores a blessing. Mar. Beloved of my soulâWould heav'n that now Thus sinking in these arms I might expire! [She falls upon his neck as he kneels. Her. Help me to raise her! Mar. No; they'll take me from thee, And shut me up in darknessâOh, my son, A little longer the death-dealing angel Will free this spirit, whilst I hang upon thee, And let thy filial bosom be my grave. Her. Call not on death! The power, that gives us life, Can make that gift a blessing, and permit us To build our best deservings upon patience Under the trials of his chast'ning grace. Mar. Enough! thou'st said it; thy inspiring words Have arm'd me to endureâSameas, where art thou? Behold me ready: Lead me to my dungeon! Sam. Not to your dungeon; though I may not set Your person free, your comforts are enlarg'd; Nor am I limited in time so strictly, But that you may enjoy some minutes more Of converse with your sonâbut longer stay Here would incur remarks, that might impede Your farther privilege; therefore be ready To follow where I lead; these friends so dearâ They shall support you, and have leave to enter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene, a Chamber. Herodian meeting Halak. Her. Welcome, my friend, I've waited your return With anxious expectationâHave you seen This new-discover'd star that all men gaze at, This wonder of the timeâmy Arab brother, And, as report proclaims, my king that shall be? Hal. I have not seen him. Her. What do you collect From those who have been happily advanc'd To that high honour? Hal. All agree in thisâ His form is manly, his demeanour bold, His language very nature, and his manners Those of the savage hordes with whom he liv'd. Her. Such is AlcanorâNow resolve me, you That have such long experience of mankind, And have been train'd in courts, what do you counsel? Shall I oppose myself to this barbarian, Whom the strong hand of Rome, and his base mother Have rais'd to sudden power, or meanly fly, And leave my wretched parent at his mercy? Hal. Here to abide were absolute destruction, Yet to desert a title, sacred deem'd For endless generations, would be treason Against yourself and heav'nâMy counsel is, That you repair to Rome, and at the foot Of CÃ¦sar's throne, where kings are fain to kneel, Put up your suit, and urge your ancient right. Her. Well you advise, and reason must approve; But in the weakness of my heart I waver; For know, my friend, in this distracted bosom, There is a tyrant passion holds command, And I am beauty's slave. In my late exile, It was my chance to harbour with a Syrian, Philotas nam'd, a hospitable man; He, when Seleucus, his unhappy monarch, Died, as you know, in wretchedness and want, Took to his charge the daughter of his master, An orphan relict, my ador'd Glaphyra: To her my vows are pledg'd, to her I promis'd Instant return. How then can I abandon All that my heart holds dear? Hal. Alas, my prince, What can I say? Love is no hero's passion; But if your word is pass'd, behold me ready To execute your will, whether it be That I should go to Rome in your behalf, Or to the Syrian beauty that enslaves you: Nor toils, nor dangers, no, not death itself, Can shake my constancy, when you demand it. Her. Thus to my heart, my grateful heart I press you, Bravest and best of friends! And now in candour Hear and forgive my weakness, whilst I own, That, haunted as my fancy is with horrors, I would not fail my promise to Glaphyra, And go to Rome were I to gain its empire, Such agonizing dreams, such dreadful visions Have haunted me this nightâMethought I saw Glaphyra struggling in the brutal arms Of that false Syrian, in whose charge I left her; Methought I heard her screams, by which awaken'd, And, leaping from my couch, I seiz'd my sword, And in my frenzy rush'd to her defence, Whilst terror shook each joint, and even now, So strong the impression dwells upon my mind, I cannot shake it from me. Hal. 'Twas the shock Of last night's scene with your imprison'd mother, That bred these fearful and distemper'd thoughts; But come with meâYour person is unknown, We will devote an hour to observation, And then prepare for what we may resolve on. [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Palace.âA State Apartment. Augusta enters, and is met by Barzilla, who attempts to kneel and is prevented. Guards attend. Aug. Welcome, Barzilla!âHold; no knees to meâ Give me your hand!âAh! my old friend, is't so? Twenty long years gone round since last we parted Have left, methinks, some tracks of winter here. Avoid the chamberâ [The Guards withdraw. Am I yet to tell you What place you keep in this recording heart, How inmost you are here? No, good Barzilla, The trust, which in your bosom I have lodg'd, The dearest secret of my life, to you Alone confided, witness my regard. Bar. And I have kept your trust religiously. Aug. I will not doubt it. Bar. I have hope you do not. Aug. No, on my life! I know you to be faithful; Let that suffice! Is the young man here with you? Bar. He waits your pleasureâ Aug. Why that downcast look, That melancholy toneâReveal thy thoughts! Art not content? If my preventive bounty Hath left thee nothing for thyself to wish, Adopt another's wants, invent desires; Be satisfaction henceforth turn'd to surfeit, And let imagination weary out Thy tongue with asking, ere my hand with giving. Bar. Below ambition, yet above caprice; Thy servant seeks not to obtrude a wish. Aug. Why then thou art content; but art thou also Mindful of former days, and that sad state Of mournful want, in which my bounty found thee? Is it still present to thy mind, how low Misfortune's leading hand had press'd thee down In life's profound decline, when I confided Alcanor, then an infant, to thy care? Set him before me. Bar. I obeyâbut look To see the merest child of nature, one As void of courtly manners, as of craft; For never yet in cities hath he dwelt, But with the wand'ring Ishmaelite in camps, And what should he of this great world have learnt More than a shepherd's boy, or how can I Train up a prince for empire and Augusta? Aug. Talk not to me in this desponding style; Look, look! is that Alcanor whom I see Clad in his Arab mantle?âHah! he comesâ Is this your shepherd-boy, your child of nature? Art cannot mend such natureâ Alcanor enters. Speak, Barzilla! Tell him to pay his homage to his mother. Bar. Son, you are now in presence of the queen. Alc. Well, if I am, what do your forms require Of him that is in presence of a queen? Aug. When, for the first time, you approach a mother, What does your nature dictate? Alc. To inquire Why I have been deserted by that mother, From infancy till nowâthis nature dictates. Aug. Imperious fate forbade that I should pay thee The duties of a mother: fourteen years I was immur'd in prison. Alc. 'Twas my father, Herod, the king now dead, that sent you thither, And do you mourn for him?âSo would not I. Bar. Check your bold tongue! You speak you know not what. Alc. I speak what nature dictates, as she bade me; Such are not apt to err. Your modes I know not, But we, the world's free denizens, who range With flocks and herds in common, where fresh pasture And welcome springs invite, must keep men honest By rendering wrong for wrong, and death for death, Our law and our religion is revenge. Aug. If, as you speak, you act, you'll find full cause, When you come forth into this faithless world, To put your Arab maxims into practice. Alc. Barzilla, tell the queen how I chastis'd The wretch, that would have forc'd the Syrian damsel. Aug. Tell it thyself. Alc. I'm ill at such relationsâ Aug. I'll hear it from none other. Alc. So it chanc'd, We harbour'd by the way with one Philotasâ Barzilla knew the manâAt dead of night, When all but villainly was laid to rest, A female scream awaken'd me from sleep; Instant I snatcht my sword, and quick, as thought, Ran where the cry directed; there I found A damsel struggling in the lustful arms Of that old caitiffâTo his heart, at once, I drove my rapier, and redeem'd the maid: 'Tis so we children of the desert actâ Barzilla knows the rest. Aug. Relate the rest. Bar. The prince hath briefly told, what briefly pass'd. I deem'd it needful to resume our march Without a moment's loss; nor could I leave, In that extremity, the rescued damsel, Half dead with terror, to abide the dangers, That needs would follow that intemperate act. Aug. You brought her with you? Alc. Yes, that charge was his; The women and the camels were his care; I and my Arab horsemen kept aloof. Beauty, like hers, was only to be trusted With purity and continence like his. Aug. Of what condition is she, slave or free? Bar. Of royal birth, the daughter of Seleucus, That hapless prince, who, when dethron'd by CÃ¦sar, Was fain to labour for his bread in Rome. Her name Glaphyraâ Aug. Set her in my sight! A maid so father'd claims our best protection. [Exit Barzilla. Alc. Did I not well? Aug. Thou didst. Alc. Barzilla chided; But why should vengeance pause when virtue suffers? He was as swift to sin, as I to punish: I'll not repent the deed. Aug. To rescue innocence Needs no repentance; but beware of love, It is not beauty, 'tis ambition now With bridal smiles, that weds thee to a throne. Alc. I know not what love isâI never felt it; But this I know, no object half so lovely Ere met my sight beforeâLo, where she comes! Barzilla conducts Glaphyra. Aug. Why 'tis a form compounded of all beauty, Simplicity with elegance combin'd, And virgin dignityâIllustrious maid; With pity we have heard the sad recital Of your misfortunes, and with all respect Due to your high descent, we bid you welcome; And much it glads us, happy fortune brought Our princely son so timely to your rescue. Alc. Speak not of thatâbanish that painful subject! Gla. 'Tis delicate, 'tis generous on your part To spare me the recital; but if words Could speak my gratitude, I'd not be silent. Aug. Barzilla, I would speak with you apart. [They withdraw. Gla. Prince, I perceive in thy sequester'd haunts Thou hast convers'd with virtueâOh, persist; Keep her for ever near, loose not her hand, Lead her to courts, to councils, on the throne Make her thy consort, and, when night comes on, Place that one faithful centinel beside thee, And thou shalt sleep secure. Alc. Rude though I am, So thou wilt teach me, I will strive to please thee. What have I seen amongst thy sex but thee? External shapes of things, that walk and move With nature's due proportions, but unpolish'd And barbarous as myself: they catch the eye, Thou ear, eye, heart; they are but earthly beings, Thou art all soul, a purifying spirit, And mak'st me a new creature. Gla. Oh, no more: I must not hear this language. Alc. Tell me then How I must speak; teach me a purer language, That, when I put up prayers for thee in absence, I may adopt it. Gla. Friendship. Alc. Ah! what's friendship? To my own sex 'tis proper and apportion'd; I've pledg'd it to Barzilla, the wild tribes, Hundreds of wandering Arabs have my friendship; The very brutes, in some degree, possess it; But thou, fair maid, for whom my heart conceives A new sensation, thou should'st so describe it, That other object may not claim or share it. Aug. Break off their conference! His heart is caught. [Apart to Barzilla. Bar. Lady, the queen invites you to retire; Considerate of your health, she has provided To entertain you in the private chamber. Alc. She has done wellâGlaphyra's spirit needs, And my repose demands itâLeave me, leave me! [To Glaphyra, who directs a look of acknowledgment to him, and departs. Exeunt Augusta and Glaphyra. Alcanor and Barzilla remain. Alc. Friend of my life, protector of my honour, I know it is to thee I owe this rescue; But have a care! The conquest was not easy, And courage, brought too often to the test, At last may failâthen I am lost for ever, And all thy cares have been bestow'd in vain. Bar. Child of my hopes, I trust thou wilt not yield To baseness, which thy noble heart abhors. Yet (I will own it to thee) when I saw The crimson tumult rush into thy cheeks, And thy fond eyes drink streams of soft desire From the fair Syrian, my heart trembled for thee. Alc. No, if her form, though fair, could so defile The sanctuary of my honour, by my soul, This weapon, which I wear, should rip it out, Though it entwin'd my heart. Bar. Yet take this cautionâ Some vices in their infancy usurp A virtuous semblance; hell-born lust awhile Its goatish ugliness can varnish o'er With cherub smiles of love; by soft approach And playful dalliance spreads its lurking fires; Then, like the infuriate Syrian, whom you slew, Bursts into flame and deals destruction round. Alc. Truly you speak my fears; I look about This new-found world with horrorâBeauty here, With tempting smiles, allures me to dishonourâ There gaunt ambition's spectre haunts my sight, Rapine and lust and murder howl around me, Those fiends that lurk beneath a throneâFarewell To those calm hours, when each returning day On Amram's banks, we call'd the golden sun Up to the east, and met the dewy breath Of morning issuing from the flowery valeâ These are for ever gone. Bar. And what can empire Give in exchange, for these so peaceful scenes? Alc. Power to dispense my mercies to mankind, And blessings dealt me by approving heaven. Bar. Then hear me, heaven! And if my breath has fann'd The native spark of this etherial fire, That burns within him, grant my earnest prayerâ Nourish the sacred flame, and as thy hand Hath rais'd it high, oh, keep it ever bright, That, like a beacon on the mountain's top, His high-enthroned virtue may be seen Clear and unsullied by a guilty world! Alc. Oh, still be near me, still direct my course, And, what you've rais'd, support! Bar. I'll not forsake thee; And should the false lights of this treach'rous world Divert (which heaven forbid!) thy youthful course From the warm chase of glory, in that moment I will come forth, recal thy devious steps Back to the saving point, from which they stray'd, And put thee in the glorious track again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Augusta, Barzilla. Bar. Now, royal lady, Rome has crown'd your wishes; I saw Alcanor mount the throne of Judah, And where your labours end, his cares commence. Aug. How was the edict relish'd by our elders, When it was publish'd in the Sanhedrim? Bar. There was a question stirr'd, if Herod's son By Mariamne was not yet alive, And Sameas, keeper of the royal prison, Was call'd upon to give in evidence His knowledge of the matter. Aug. What said he? Bar. He said, that, holding office confidential Under the king, he'd answer to none else. Aug. And well he saidâBehold, the king approachesâ Alcanor in his royal robes, followed by his Guards, Arabs, Sameas, and after them Halak and Herodian, who stand apart. Aug. Long life and glorious to JudÃ¦a's king! Alc. Health, and as many years of calm content As may please heaven, to our much-honour'd mother! Your forms have wearied me; but though no time Nor ancient use can dignify such trifles, They harm not me, so let them take their course. Now, soldier, you, that to the bearded elders, When question'd of your prison'r, gave for answer, That you would plead to none, but to the king, Know that the king commends your bold reply, And now requires you to disclose to him, What you withheld from themâThe question is, If Mariamne hath a son alive? Sam. The queen, my prisoner, hath a living son. Aug. Sameas, correct yourselfâ'tis known to all Herodian died in Syria. Alc. Hear you this? Upon what proof do you assert he's living? Sam. Upon the evidence of my own senses. I should be much-unwilling, in this presence, To stake my credit upon proof less certain. Alc. The man is confident. Let him proceed. Sam. It had been long, oh king, my painful duty To hold, in strict and solitary durance, The wretched Mariamne; once the consort Of your late royal father; till last night, So harsh were my instructions, none approach'd her, Myself excepted; the sun's cheering light Ne'er visited her dungeon, when it pleas'd My gracious queen, here present, to inspect Her dying state with pity, and allow me To abate the rigour of my former treatment. Alc. Go on, tell all the horrors of your prison; I blush for human nature whilst I hear you. Sam. Arm'd with authority, so grateful to me, I did not lose a moment to impart These mercies to my pris'ner, I releas'd her From her dark cell, let her inhale the air, Then balmy soft, and reconcile her sight To evening's sober shades: here, while she stood, A man, well known to her in former time, Halak by name, who, at the prison gates, Day after day had come, with fruitless suit, Craving my leave to pay his mournful duty, Unseen of me till then, address'd my pris'ner, And much delight his welcome greeting gave her. Thus far I suffer'd, when behold a stranger, Young, and of aspect dignified and noble, Instant appears, and kneeling at her feet, Proclaims himself Herodian, and her son: She starts, surveys him, falls upon his neck, And whilst he clasps her fainting in his arms, She, with maternal ecstacy entranc'd, Calls upon heaven to let her die at once, And breathe out her sad spirit on his bosom. Alc. For ever sacred be the rights of nature! Who shall withhold the mother from her child? You, madam, are a mother, you have felt All the soul-rending pangs your pris'ner feels; Recal these horrors to your thoughts, and say How you would wish your son to think and act. Aug. I wish my son to think this specious tale A plot, concerted with the medling elders, To impose a false Herodian on the world, And conjure up a rival to dethrone you. Let Sameas, who describes this tender meeting, Say, if he held this stranger for the son Of MariamneâIf he did, I tell him He is a traitor not to have secur'd him. Alc. Have you done this? Sam. I have not. Alc. Could you do it? Had you a guard? Sam. I do acknowledge it. Aug. Here then at once I put you to the testâ Either confess that all you have been telling Is a mere fable, or avow the truth, And own yourself accomplice in the plot. Sam. No, I stand here at issue for the truth, And, be it what it may, I will abide it. He whom I saw, and suffer'd to escape, I then believ'd, and hold to that belief, Was true Herodian, Mariamne's son: But if, because I had not heart to tear him From the embraces of a dying mother, I am to suffer, let the axe fall on me! If I'm a traitor, 'tis of mercy's making; You may condemn meâI appeal to heaven. Aug. He braves our vengeance. Guards, arrest the traitor! Alc. Hold, madam, though short counsels suit me well, A man's life may demand a moment's pause. Let it be known that Sameas is in peril, And if the man he sav'd be the true prince, He will stand forth in honour, and avow it. Herodian comes from behind the Guards. Her. Behold him present! He you seek, am I. The true Herodian, son of Mariamneâ If you require a witness, here is one, A friend that knows me, and is known of all. [Addressing himself to Halak, who stands beside him. Alc. 'Tis well! I doubt you not: your manly bearing Bespeaks your royal birth, and needs no voucher. How did you pass our guard, and for what purpose Are you here present? Her. At the call of honour I came to justify this generous man, Knowing the danger I had drawn upon him. If 'tis in him a crime not to have seiz'd me, Behold I am his pris'nerâhe has seiz'd me, And holds me faster, bound by my own sense Of justice, gratitude, and conscious honour, Than all the fetters you can pile upon me. Alc. Fetters and prisons are a coward's weapons, A tyrant's mean resource; let the laws shackle Robbers and thieves, but my ambition's rival, If such you are, go forth, erect your standard, And strike for empire! I'll not hold your person. Aug. My son, beware.âHerodian is your rival; You have him in your powerâDid you not say Your law and your religion is revenge? Alc. True; but what is there to revenge in him? How am I wrong'd, because he is my brother, My father's son? Is it offence to me That the affections of his heart impell'd him To visit an imprison'd, dying mother, At risk of his own liberty and life? Put me in his place, and yourself in hers, How would you then exclaim, if I were seiz'd For visiting your cell, or this good man Traduc'd and menac'd for permitting it? Speak, those that hear me, do I judge aright? What says Barzilla? Bar. Oh, persist in mercy! If yon have hope of happiness in heaven, Or heart's content on earth, I do conjure you Lift not your hand against Herodian's life. Aug. Enough; you've said itâYour all-powerful voice Is law: Barzilla is JudÃ¦a's king. Alc. Affghar! Aff. What says my king? Alc. Draw out your guard, My faithful Arabs; I am going forth. Aug. Whither, with what intent? Alc. To teach Herodian How he should act to you, if giddy fortune Should raise him to the throne, and hurl me down. My nature is not made to war with women; If Herod's frenzy threw his wives in prison, The son of Herod will not hold them there. Brother, your handâLet Sameas lead the way. [Exit with the Guards, and all but Augusta. Augusta alone. Go, get thee hence, thou honourable madman! Open the prison gates, make clear the dungeon, Which thou thyself shalt be the next to enter. Dupe of Barzilla's virtues, I predict This vanity of mercy will undo thee; Death will cut short thy triumphsâAs a meteor Gives one bright flash, and then is seen no more. So will thy gloryâHah, Glaphyra comesâ If there is any power to counteract The influence of Barzilla, it is love, And her bright eyes already have inspir'd it. Glaphyra enters. Gla. Health to Augusta! Aug. Health and happiest hours, With ever-circling joys, to fair Glaphyra! I have a friendly claim upon your patience For a few private moments. Gla. I attend, With due devotion, to your royal pleasure. Aug. Come, you must put aside this distant air, And hear a woman to a woman speak, Without reserve, the language of the heartâ If each fair form, which this wide world contains, Could here assemble, you alone, Glaphyra, Daughter of Syria's monarch, have my voice, Were I to choose a consort for Alcanor. Gla. I am the child of solitude; your throne Is circled with ambitious beautyâchoose From that fair circle some less humble maid. Aug. Why this reserve. You cannot but perceive Our son adores you. Gla. I take heaven to witness, That never, from the sad distressful moment, In which your son first found me, to this hour, Have I, by word, or look, or female art, Attempted his affections. Aug. Can I doubt it? Your high-born dignity, your conscious pride And self-respect would never so descend. Nor could Alcanor's generous heart be won By arts like theseâYour honour he has rescued, Your person snatcht from ruin worse than deathâ This you will not denyâ Gla. Reward him, heaven, With never-fading glory! May his throne In wisdom and in mercy be establish'd, And, in the arms of some superior fair, Endear'd by beauty and by truth ennobled, Whilst I am distant far, may he forget That e'er Glaphyra's name provok'd a sigh! Aug. Now I can read your heart and solve its doubts: You see a rude unpractis'd son of nature, Encompass'd with temptations, and you paint Youth's giddy bark, with swelling sails outspread, Driv'n by the breath of flattery on the rocks Of pleasure's faithless shore; you see our son Press, with a trembling weight, the unsteady throne: Save him, Glaphyra; let not your preserver Be made the victim of romantic honour: Ev'n now he's gone against my strong protest To set the imprison'd Mariamne freeâ 'Tis madness, and not mercy. Gla. Oh, 'tis great, 'Tis glorious. Aug. Child, you say you know not what; That Mariamne is his rival's mother, That rival is Herodian; whilst he lives Rome may give kings, peace she can never give To vext JudÃ¦a, for in him the line Of David centers, and with him would ceaseâ Well may you start and be amaz'dâfor know, Here in this very spot, just ere you enter'd, Herodian stoodâdefenceless, self-surrender'd, SingleâMy son surrounded by his guardsâ What did he?âWond'rous to relate, he spar'd him, Call'd him his brother, took him by the hand, And led him forth, Barzilla at his side, To witness the deliverance of his motherâ And see he comesâNow, now be firm, and save him! Alcanor enters hastily. Alc. I've freed your pris'ner. Chide me not, good mother, For I am mercifulâBy him that made me, I would not wear your crown on other terms. Hah! what is this? Why does Glaphyra kneel? Why stream those beauteous eyes? Aug. She has a suit; Hear her, my son; so shall her wisdom guard The throne, her beauty well deserves to share. Gla. No, no, I covet not to share his throne; You much mistake my suit. Not to the king, But to the godlike attribute, which deals Such mercies to mankind, to that I kneel. O prince, the prayers that gratitude shall breathe From the full hearts of mothers and of sons, By thee redeem'd, shall be to heaven more welcome, Than the rich incense of a hundred altars Steaming with sacrifice, and thou, for whom Those prayers are offer'd, shalt be crown'd with blessings. Now, royal sir, permit me to depart: [She rises. My longer stay will but offend the queen. Alc. If it offends the queen, the queen can take A ready method to avoid the offence. Aug. I understand you, sir, and am as ready To take, as you are to suggest, that method: But have a care how you provoke the vengeance Of an insulted mother; what much time And pains have made, a moment can unmake. [Exit. Alcanor, Glaphyra. Gla. Alas, I tremble: she is greatly mov'd; For pity's sake dismiss me. Alc. No; I will not. Mysteries I hate, and menaces I laugh at. Gla. You will not!âis it thus Alcanor speaks? Alc. I pray you pardon me; I am not yet practis'd, Like the tame sons of idleness and ease, In the smooth phrase of courts. My tuneless voice, Crack'd with the shoutings of the clamorous chase, Ne'er sounded love's soft pitch; some happier lips Pour those melodious accents in your ear, Whilst mine grate harsh and hateful. Gla. Were this so, Were it forbidden by our destiny That we should meet, I'm sure your noble nature Would not attempt to arrest my plighted heart From its allegiance. Alc. Be not sure of that; I know not yet what nature I am of. Gla. Let Mariamne, let Herodian say What nature you are of. Alc. They know but little; And nothing to the point of my forbearance. When I show mercy to a fallen enemy, I do not thwart my nature, I indulge it. But, if I saw you in the exulting arms Of a successful rivalâheaven and earth! Let not that rival meet me in my wrath. Gla. Might I not hope, if pity were too feeble, Pride and your inborn dignity would check you? Alc. No, were Barzilla's self to cross me then, What might befal my friend, my more than father, I tremble to conjecture. Oft I've driven The spotted panther to his desperate bay, Yet never brook'd I a companion's spear To strike my destin'd victim, and arrest The savage trophies I had held in chase. Gla. Spare me, in pity spare me, let me pay My grateful thanks and part. Alc. Stay yet a moment!â You bade me, if I e'er became a king, That I should take fair virtue by the hand, Lead her to courts, to councils, on the throne Make her my consort?âThus behold I take Fair virtue by the handâAscend my throne! There sit enshrin'd, like a protecting angel, With guardian wings outspread and fostering smiles Sheltering the frighted tribes, that start aghast From my fierce manners and coarse rugged looks. Gla. Talk not of looks or manners; all is noble, In every feature, every word and act Alcanor's soul impressively appears; And sure I am, the guardian of my honour Will not expose me longer to the chance Of what the queen in anger may devise, But let me fly for refuge to Barzilla. Alc. 'Tis granted; if there be one human heart, Where virtue may repose, it is Barzilla's. Approach, my faithful Affghar!âTo your care I give a sacred trust, defenceless beauty And virgin innocenceâthe test of friendshipâ Conduct this lady to Barzilla's castle, Where I have lodg'd Herodian and his mother; You know the placeâSay I have sent her to him For refuge from the malice of Augustaâ There needs no moreâFarewell!âStay not to thank me; But part at onceâMy Arabs will protect you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Alcanor, Herodian. Her. Alcanor, when we parted at the prison, Such was the scene, so powerful were my feelings, I could not speak to you, and even now, Conscious you look not to the praise of men, I'll not oppress your ear, or waste your time With a display of wordsâYou have done nobly; Henceforth I am your brother, not your rival. Alc. I know not what I've done, that should demand That sacrifice from you: I found you here Under my roof, a brotherâHad I found My direst enemy, could I have harm'd him? I found a hapless woman in my prison, I let her outâCould any man do less? If, in pursuit of what my heart inspir'd, My heart has led me right, why praise me for it? When virtue seeks more than its own reward, It becomes vanityâI will not hear you. Her. Oh, blessed solitudes, oh, sacred haunts Of uncorrupted nature, where the eye, Ranging the interminable wild, discovers Nor fence, nor landmark to confine its scope, But all it sees possesses, till the soul, Expanding with the space it contemplates, Grows like the scene, magnificent and vast. Alc. Yes, in the desert, which has been my school, We think and act at large; but like the plant, That, shrinking at the touch, folds up its leaves, So, in its contact with a guilty world, The soul collects and draws within itself Its wide-expanded feelingsâTherefore fly, Before my mother's policy prevents it; Whilst yet my power protects you, speak your wishes, And speak your wantsâMy hand is open to you. Her. 'Tis nobly offer'dâBy my father's bounty, Whilst Mariamne reign'd, I was endow'd With fair possessions in the vale of Sharon: Thither, so you confirm the royal grant, My wishes pointâAmbition I renounce. Alc. If that contents you, I confirm the grant. What have you more to ask? Her. Illustrious youth, By virtue more exalted than by fortune, Of heaven I've much to ask on your behalf, Of you my benefactor nothing more, But simply your permission and safe conduct For my departure hence. Alc. Whither to go? Her. I have a friend some two days journey off, Beside the Merom lakeâhis name Philotasâ Alc. Well, what of him? Her. I lay my heart before youâ Philotas has in trust its dearest treasureâ An orphan maidâ Alc. Go on!âHer name?â Her. Glaphyra. Alc. You love her, and you left her with Philotas?â Her. I did. Alc. Why then you left her with a villain. Her. Uphold me, heaven! has he betray'd his trust? Alc. He was in act to do it, when I sav'd her; Whilst she was struggling in his arms I kill'd him, I struck him to the heart, and sav'd Glaphyra. Her. Oh, let me kneel, and call on heaven to bless you! [Is about to kneel. Alc. Forbear! Man was not born to be ador'd, And you, perhaps, are kneeling to a demon: Stand up! you know not what is passing here. Answer me trulyâAre you married to her? Her. I am not married, but our faith is pledg'd. Alc. Leave me; escape! begone upon the moment, Before the fire that's kindling shall consume youâ Oh, through my head, my heart! Lost, lost for ever! [Exit abruptly. Barzilla enters. Bar. Hah! what is this? Her. Oh, good Barzilla, save him! He rages with a passion for Glaphyra, And I, unhappily for his repose, Have own'd myself possess'd of her affections. Bar. Away! you'll find Glaphyra at the castle; She's with the queen your motherâbe prepar'd For instant flight. Lose not a moment's time; But leave your cause to me. Her. Angels inspire you With powers of soft persuasion to appease him! [Exit. Alcanor re-enters. Alc. Where is he going? Call him back, Barzilla! Bar. Why; for what purpose? Alc. I revoke my mercy: He tempts me past my bearingâStay me not: The vessel of my peace is tempest-torn, Whelm'd by conflicting passions, rack'd with love, And gulf'd in deep despair. Bar. Are you a man? Alc. Away! I never will resign Glaphyra: He shall not live, that dares dispute my title. Bar. Your title! What's your title to Glaphyra, If she has pledg'd her heartâthe tyrant's title, The title of the wolf to seize the lamb? I tell you, sir, you are about to do The very deed, for which you kill'd Philotas. Alc. 'Tis false. Who dares to call my love a crime? Recal the odious word! Bar. No, I avow it: Commit what crime you may, I'm not afraid To give it its true name. Alc. Down on your knees, Beg for your life! Hence from my heart for ever! All memory of your friendship I cast off. Lo, I am arm'd: escape whilst yet you can: You tread upon your graveâ Bar. I care not; strike! Here is my heartâStrike, parricide, but know You kill your father. Alc. Hah! my father?âYes; I've call'd you fatherâ Bar. By the eternal truth, I am your father: your intemperate rage Has wrung the secret out: Augusta's son, Whose princely name you bear, died in his birth, And poverty corrupted my weak virtue To substitute my infant in his place. Alc. Did you do this? Bar. I did this guilty deed: Unseen of all, in the dead hour of night, Tempted by dire necessity, I took thee, A smiling infant, from thy mother's breast, And gave thee to Augusta, in the place Of her lost hope expiring at her side. Alc. I'll hear no more; the fable is too gross: There cannot be in nature such a parent, Or, if there were, it cannot be Barzilla. Could I believe that you had been this monster, Who sold your child, barter'd your blood for shekels, And brooded o'er a lie for twenty years, By the Great Power that made me, I'd not live To meet the direful curse, that must pursue And overtake the son of such a father. Bar. Your sword was in your hand, your visage wild; I trembled at the sightâ Alc. Lo, I am calm: The horror that hangs o'er me, has subdued And made all lesser passions sink before it. If truth you told, few hours are left for me, And, when I drop the sceptre, death receives me; There I shall meet my judgeâHere then I pause Upon the awful interim, prepar'd So to employ it, as shall best atone To him, whose right, unconscious, I usurp'd. [Exit. Augusta enters. Aug. Ah! have I found you? Do you turn aside And hang your head? What sullen discontent Has seiz'd the sage philosopher of Shinar, The great Gamaliel of the wilderness? Does your boy-king rebel, and has the Syrian Conjur'd another passion up, to rival Your fine new-fangled maxims of forbearance And self-denial? Have Glaphyra's eyes, Arm'd with almighty love, taught him a lesson Not to be found in your morality? Bar. Oh, most unnatural father that I am! Lost, hopeless wretch! for ever be accurs'd The hour in which, by sordid bribes allur'd, (Like the base Canaanites who sold their brother) I took your dead Alcanor, and impos'd My living babe upon the credulous king. Now, now the dreadful retribution falls On my devoted headâNever again Shall I enfold him in these aged arms: I have disclos'd the fatal secret to him; He knows me for his father, and I sink Under his filial curses to the grave, The murderer of my son. Aug. Oh, where was then Heav'n's vengeance? Why did not the lightning strike Or e'er that word had pass'd thy perjur'd lips, Bound by so many and such solemn oaths To an eternal secresy? Thou traitor!â To thine ownself as faithless as to meâ To thine own sonâDost think he will believe thee? No, he shall not; I'll out-face thy confession, And thou shalt find, that I have still the power To punish the betrayer of my trustâ Away! begone! I hold no talk with traitors. [Exit Barzilla. As Barzilla goes out, Serapion appears. Aug. Approach, Serapion! Ser. Behold your slave! I live but to obey you. Aug. Slave, methinks Thou'rt an Egyptian. When our royal Herod Met Antony and his imperial mistress At Samosata, thou wast in the train Of that fair revellerâ'Twas then, Serapion, Thy better stars preferr'd thee to my service. Ser. Blest be the time! If you, my royal lady, Bear it in mind, how should your slave forget it? Aug. Men of thy cast, they say, will promise fair, And shrink from the performanceâTell me now, If I were haunted with a walking spirit, Whom I would lay to rest, dar'st thou administer A spell to quiet it? Ser. I dare do any thing, That thou dar'st counsel. Aug. Nay, thou shalt not feed On airy promisesâHere, take this jewelâ What, man, accept it! Ser. My thrice-bounteous lady, There needs not this to bind me to thy service. Aug. That stone might grace the diadem of CÃ¦sar, Yet is it but a foretaste of my bounty. Be faithful, and thou shalt be drench'd in gold, Steep'd to the lips in treasure, blazing bright, Like Mammon's altar, pil'd with glittering ore, The offerings of idolatry to sin. Ser. Who bleeds for this? Aug. Barzilla. Ser. Hah! Barzilla?â Aug. Doth it revolt thee? In the western tower He sleeps this night: thou art most private there; Know'st every passage, and can'st thread the maze, That darkling winds around the vaulted pile, Commodious for the deed thou tak'st in hand. Ser. Say'st thou this night? He sleeps his lastâ Aug. But swear, Swear to perform it! Ser. By each sacred thing, That can record or sanctify my oath, I swearâ Aug. 'Tis well! You med'cine my sick soul, Pouring the balm of comfort on the wounds Ingratitude has madeâHe falls; he diesâ But see the king!âremember, and be faithful. [Exit Serapion. Alcanor enters to Augusta. Aug. Welcome, my son! you come upon a wish. Alc. I come to call your conscience to account. It has been told me I am not your son. Aug. And who is he that dares avow that falsehood? Alc. Barzilla. Aug. Yes; Barzilla has his motives: You may ev'n thank yourself for that deception: You've turn'd the brain of that old doting man, Who having foster'd you these twenty years, Now fain would father you. 'Tis all a plot, To sink your high-born energy of soul By peasant principles, and to melt down The bright imperial ore, of which I form'd you, To his base dross. Some sudden start of passion, Some gust, that gave his apathy alarm, Drove him to this resource. Alc. I do confess 'Twas when he urg'd me to resign Glaphyra, And had so gall'd my spirit by reproaches, That in my rage I was about to kill him. Aug. There, there the artifice convicts itself. Why did he feign himself to be your father? He trembled for his life. When I advis'd The seizure of your rival, and prepar'd Glaphyra to receive you in her arms, Why, but to keep your noble mind in bondage, Did he oppose my counsels, and persuade you To enlarge Herodian, and renounce Glaphyra? But you shall still possess herâThe true parent Gives joy, gives rapture; the false father chills Your generous passion with the freezing maxims Of cold forbearanceârules unfit for kings. Alc. Is he a king, within whose bosom reigns A tyrant passion, that enslaves his reason? Aug. Is he a man, who lends his easy faith To fictions, that would not deceive a child? And what does he deserve, who would degrade The son of Herod to a peasant's brat? Were you his son, would he conspire against you? No, 'tis because he knows you to be mine, That, in his malice against me your mother, He leagues with those, who call JudÃ¦a's throne The throne of David, and would pull you from it. Strike then, while yet you may, oh, strike these traitors; Live, reign, be happy, know me for thy mother, Or fly with him, and be a wretch for ever! Alc. No, 'tis too late for flight; having advanc'd, I never can go back: all that I am I must for ever be, or cease to be: Having once been a king, I will not live Detected, an impostor, at the mercy Of my triumphant rival, and behold Oh, worse than death! Glaphyra in his arms. Aug. Hah! is it so? Does she reject Alcanor, Her brave defender, and prefer Herodian? Alc. Oh, fatal truth! I have preserv'd her honour, He has possess'd her heart. Aug. Where is your spirit? Where is that brave revenge, of which you boasted? Alc. Ah, if I am thy son, forbear to tempt me: Should not a mother turn my heart to mercy, Not to revenge? Aug. Should not a mother save Her son from madness, from despair and death? Take nature's answer from a mother's lipsâ I wouldâCan mercy point that saving way? 'Tis not in mercy's power: to justice then Turn thy revolving thoughts; inquire of reason, Ask if 'tis fitting to supplant a son, To give a son's fair birthright to his rival, And sacrifice thy life to save Herodian's: Does heav'n prescribe such mercy to a mother? I'll not believe it does: I, like thyself, Was once weak pity's dupe, and mark what follow'dâ Twice sev'n long years of dark imprisonmentâ If the example terrifies, avoid it, And profit by experience dearly purchas'd. Alc. Urge me no farther. Leave me to reflection. What you have said has sunk into my heart; I do believe Barzilla has deceiv'd me. Aug. Be confident of that. He is a traitor: Think no more of him. Alc. Had I never left Arabia's deserts, never seen Glaphyra, Love and ambition had been harmless passions, And I been happy. Aug. Be advis'd by me, And you shall still be happy. Alc. Oh, too much, Too much alreadyâI will hear no more. Aug. Farewell! remember, in the western tower Herodian sleepsâ [Exit Augusta. Alcanor alone. What then? There let him sleep! Avaunt, seducer! let my virtue struggle. Strengthen my soul, just heav'n! Let him awake To-morrow, and be blestâOn him the sun Laughing shall rise; round him the dancing hours Shall tread their sportive measuresâhis the day And every dayâNight and despair are mine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Herodian, Glaphyra. Her. Yes, my Glaphyra, 'twas a dreadful moment, And even so as you describe its terrors My fancy drew it in my last night's dream. Methought I saw the accursed Syrian seize you, No saving angel came, no brave Alcanor Flew to your rescueâHorror froze my blood. Gla. Pierc'd to the heart at once Philotas fell; So sudden was the stroke, I saw it not, Nor knew the hand that sav'd me. Her. Heaven reward him! Were the world's empire mine, I'd yield it to him. But what is empire? Fond, unhappy youth, His heart, alas! is sensible as mine To beauty's fair perfectionâHe adores you. Gla. With pity I behold his painful struggle. Her. And do you not behold his virtues too With admiration? If he now should claim Your gratitude, your loveâcould you reject him. Gla. Where would your question lead me? Her. What am I? What have I done? He sav'd you, I forsook you: With me you sink into a private station, With him you mount a throne. Gla. No more of this, You say it but to prove if thrones would tempt me; Therein you wrong the daughter of Seleucus, Whose glories once, though now eclips'd and lost, Dazzled the nations. To Alcanor's virtues I bend with reverence, from his love I shrink With terror and affright. Her. And cause there is For terror and affright: I've seen him rage Fierce as the gust, that tears his sandy wilds, And fiery as the sun, whose burning orb Withers parch'd nature up. Oh, my soul's treasure, That we could fly from hence!â Halak enters. My friend, what tidings? Hal. Alcanor comes; I pass'd him on the way. Her. Comes he in peace and mercy to release us? Hal. I know not that: he stopp'd and briefly ask'd me If Mariamne liv'dâere I could answer, Go tell your prince, he cried, that I am coming To fix his fortune and my own for ever. Her. How look'd he when he spoke those awful words? Hal. Fatally wild, and, as a shadow, pale; And, whilst with quiv'ring lips and hurried speech He bade me warn you to the western tower, The very scene inspir'd my soul with horror; For there no ray of heav'n's blest light is seen, Hope, cheerful offspring of the morn, ne'er enters, But murder, ambush'd in those gloomy cells, With list'ning ear, in midnight silence, sits Watching the hour, that tolls her victim's knell. Her. Break off! I never will suspect Alcanor, And if he wrongs my confidence, behold! I have a weaponâLook, our mother comesâ Mariamne enters. Mar. Once more, my son, with feeble step and slow, As fits a wretch just sinking to her grave, Trembling I come to take a last farewell. The prince, who wrongfully usurps your throne, Has, in his mercy, deign'd to set me free, And though too late that mercy comes, I thank him, I bless him for the deed. With this fair princess, To whom you are affianc'd, you may live Secure, nor envy him a crown of cares. Thus let me join your handsâIn sight of heaven Here kneeling interchange your nuptial vows, So shall I breathe a blessing on you both, And die content. [They kneel. Her. Recording angels, hear me! And, whilst I press to my devoted heart This virgin hand, witness my wedded oath! Sow say, Glaphyra, if thy soul accords To this my solemn vow. Gla. To every word, Conscious what judgments would await the breach Of this our mutual oath, I do accord. Mar. Rise, rise, ye wedded pair! Offspring of kings, To great achievements born, now arm your hearts To meet the dangerous trial that awaits you. In courts like this, floated with human blood And peopled with assassins, whilst you stand With only truth and justice on your side, Both naked, both unarm'd, you well may doubt How long Alcanor's mercy shall withstand The vengeful precepts of his cruel mother. Her. A few short minutes will decide on that; Ev'n now I'm summon'dâHark, I hear his trumpet. [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Western Tower. Alcanor with Guards, meets Sameas. Alc. How now, whence come you? Why that bloody sword? Sam. 'Tis an assassin's blood. Barzilla's stabb'd By an Egyptian slave, whom in the act I seiz'd and slewâ Alc. Oh, lead me, lead me to him! A Chamber in the interior. Barzilla is discovered wounded. Alcanor enters. Alc. My friend, my father!âOh, accursed deed, Soul-rending sight! What can I do to save thee? Bar. Nothing: 'tis all in vain. The slave has kill'd me. The queen, the queen suborn'd himâhe confess'd it. Alc. Oh, horror, horror! Then am I thy murderer; For I inform'd the queen of all that pass'd, When, to arrest my hand uprais'd to strike, You feign'd yourself my fatherâ'Twas a fault, But grievously, alas! you have aton'd. Bar. It was indeed a sin, a crying sin, But not against the truthâI am thy father. Alc. Stop; have a care! Thou'rt dyingâDo not load Thy parting soul. Bar. I know that I am dying; I feel it, and with my expiring breath I take it on my soulâI am thy father. Alc. Augusta vouches stronglyâ Bar. Yes, and kills me For having told the truthâSurely, my son, Thou wilt not curse me. Alc. Mark, if I will curse theeâ Judge of all human hearts, absolve my father! Blanch with his contrite tears this crimson sin, And, white as snow, record him in the book Of life eternal!âGive me now thy blessing! Bar. Ye interceding angels, who address The throne of mercy for imperfect man, Make this dear youth your care, confirm his virtue, And grant him lifeâif life be innocenceâ But if dishonour, infamy await him, Waft him yet guiltless on your wings to glory! Alc. Help then to fit me for this tow'ring flight, And with parental firmness point this sword Against this recreant bosomâ'Tis not me, 'Tis guilt you killâOh, stab it to my heart! Bar. What do you mean? Declare! Alc. This midnight hour, This solitary silence, mad desires, And prompt occasion, aided by the counsels Of my seducing mother, all assail'd And shook my constancy; with ready sword I came prepar'd to call my rival forth To equal combatâ Bar. Oh, my son, forbear! With my last breath, I warn you to forbearâ And now I can no moreâreach out your handâ Farewell for ever!âOh! I faintâI die! [Dies. Alc. My father, oh, my fatherâlook upon me! Lift up your eyes awhile, and ere you close Their trembling lids, behold a deed of justice! Ah no, he's deadâHis spirit has escap'd, And all his troubles cease. He's gone for ever. One false, one fatal step, and only one, Marr'd a whole life of virtueâAffghar, Arabs! Stand by the body, and with reverence guard itâ Now lead me to HerodianâHah, who comes? Augusta enters. Remorseless woman, is it not enough To kill by proxy, must you come in person To feast upon the sight of human blood? Arrest that murderess! She is not my mother. Aug. Hah! say'st thou? Stop these ruffians! Pause a moment, And hear me speak apartâI yet will save theeâ There is no plea in nature, that should urge thee To spare Herodian: he is not thy brother. Thou art Barzilla's son, a peasant born, Rais'd by my bounty to a kingly throne. Wilt thou resign Glaphyra? Art thou mad To sacrifice revenge, ambition, love? The secret of thy birth dies with thy father; Send but Herodian where Barzilla is, And thou shalt reign secureâ Alc. Avaunt, seducer! Tempt me no moreâa father's dying words Are sacredâLook! his wound bursts out afresh; Though dead, his blood cries out on me for justice! Seize her, arrest her! drag her to her dungeon! [The Arab guard forces Augusta off. Alcanor exit. Herodian and Glaphyra. Her. Be comforted, my love! though I must leave thee, I will not doubt but that commission'd spirit, Which o'er the sleep of virgin innocence Keeps his angelic watch, will here be present, As heretofore he was in greater need. Gla. I fear not for myself; Alcanor's nature Is far too noble to conceive such baseness; It is for thee I tremble; 'tis the malice Of his revengeful mother, and the effects Of this expected interview I dread. The pangs of jealousy are new to him; Mild to submission, dreadful when oppos'd, His fiery passions ill endure restraint. Her. In this, and through our lives in every trial, 'Tis on heaven's providence we must depend; And ah! if now we part to meet no more, Dear to my soul, farewell! There was a moment, A fond weak momentâbut it was a short oneâ When, in my anxious care to guard your life, I had foregone your love. That now is past; Our faith is plighted by an oath in heaven, And we must fall, if such our fateâtogether. Gla. Behold me ready! Her. Peace; break off! I'm summon'd. Sameas enters. Sam. Prince, 'tis the king's command that you repair, Without a moment's loss, under my guard To attend the Sanhedrim, that now is met. To you, fair princess, like command I bear, And the same quick obedience is enjoin'd; Be pleas'd to followâNo excuse will serve. [Exeunt. Scene draws off, and discovers a magnificent Hall, in which the Sandhedrim is assembled in their proper Habiliments. A Throne in the centre for the King, and on each side barriers to prevent intrusion upon the space devoted to the Elders, &amp;c. Chief Eld. [Rising.] Why with such haste, at this late hour of night, Our Arab king hath summon'd us to council, Brethren, I am yet to learn; but this I know, And you, ye sages of the law, can witness, The right of Mariamne's son to reign, As heir of David's lineage, stands enroll'd, With dire denunciation of heav'n's wrath On all opposersâThis premis'd, I yield To Rome's decree, and call on this assembly To rise with one accord, and greet Alcanor Their king, now entering to ascend his throne. Alcanor enters; the Elders all rise, and salute him as he passes, by laying their hands across upon their breasts, and bowing their heads. He ascends the steps of the Throne, bows to the Sanhedrim, and seats himself upon itâThen, after a pause, speaks as follows. Alc. Elders of Judah, with no better speech Than nature dictates, I shall tax your patience. Exil'd and driv'n to range Arabia's deserts From infancy till now, your laws and records Are undivulg'd to me: I neither question, Nor can acknowledge what I never saw. Call'd to this throne, I hold it for a duty To let you know how I have us'd the power Intrusted to me for your general good, Within the period of this one short day Which I have pass'd amongst you. Ch. Eld. Royal sir, The Sanhedrim are honour'd in this pledge Of your most princely candour, and we hail it As an auspicious omen, that a reign, Which so commences, will be long and glorious. Alc. Grave sirs, I pray you, treat me not with flattery; Other applause than my own conscience gives Will be but lost upon me. Your late king, Upon what cause concerns me not to inquire, Left an imprison'd lady at my mercy, His queen, and mother of his son. By heaven, It mov'd my indignation to be heir Of such a legacyâI set her freeâ Do you approve? Ch. Eld. With heart and soul, we thank you, And 'tis no flattery to declare such mercy In you, the son of Herod and Augusta, Is truly great, beneficent, and noble. Alc. Then nature must be thank'd, that put within me A heart that never could oppress the fallen. Now, sirs, I know there are amongst you some, Who look'd with evil eyes on my electionâ I care not which they are; let them avow it; I bear no malice to sincerity: Herodian has their wishâI have his person Now in my powerâI would not touch his life For the world's worth: I've summon'd him before you. Let him assert his right, and let all those, Who hold the covenant of heaven in honour, Speak for the son of David, and uphold him Against the specious claims of an assassin, For with that name I brand my seeming mother. Ch. Eld. In wonder and amazement we are lost; Abash'd, confounded: such a dreadful charge, And with such dignity of soul enforc'd, By one so interested to suppress it, Deprives us of all speechâ Alc. Produce your prisoner! Affghar and the Arabs enter, bringing in Augusta under guard, as Prisoner. Ch. Eld. Oh, heaven and earth!âThe queen?â Alc. Aye, sirs, the queenâ But call not upon heaven when she is present, For in heav'n's peace a murderess has no part. Stand from before her!âThat remorseless woman, When foil'd and mourning o'er her dying child, Seduc'd Barzilla (the best man on earth That fatal act excepted) to impose Me, me his new-born infant, on the king, And father her dead princeâOh, shame to nature! This fatal secret, twenty years conceal'd, He, in his agony, confess'd to me, When dying from the stab of an assassin, By her suborn'd to kill himâLet her answer If this be not the truth. Aug. I will not answer A base impostor. What is truth to thee, Thou peasant slave, whose whole life is a lie? Till I can find language, that may express My hatred, my contempt, I will be dumb. Alc. You have heard enough. To your hands I commit her: My power draws to an end: take her away! [They take Augusta off. Say, is it fitting such a wretch should live? Ch. Eld. With grief of heart, we say it is not fitting. Alc. Now, sirs, you've heard the sum of my short annals; I reign'd in ignorance, but I reign'd in mercy. Here comes your rightful kingâ Herodian and Glaphyra, with Sameas, Halak, &amp;c. Approach, Herodian, And you, the fair enslaver of my heart! The Sanhedrim have heard my full confession, And how betray'd to think myself a prince, The son of Herod, I have press'd your throne With an usurper's, not a tyrant's, weight. Had I remain'd unconscious of my birth, I should have held my seat, and sent you hence To find redress where you had chose to seek it. But now assume your right, ascend your throne, And place beside you that angelic maid, Whose innocence it was my happiest lot to save, Whose love my first ambition to deserve, But my sad fortune never to obtain. Her. Heroic youth, in virtue more sublime Than thrones can make you, oh, be near me still, And teach me how to reign! Alc. Your heart will teach you; That must be virtue, which Glaphyra loves. Gla. And thou art virtueâ Alc. Oh, no more! Too late, Too late those pitying eyes are turn'd upon me. My spirit is too proud to be imprison'd In an ignoble case: it bends its flight To realms, where disappointment never dwells, And love is universal as the day, That brightens through eternityâBehold! Thus, thus I set it freeâ [Stabs himself. Her. Oh, horror, horror! [The Sanhedrim rises. Rise, fathers, rise! Support him, save him! Ah! He diesâthe fatal point has reach'd his heart; 'Tis finish'dâHe expires! What noble fruit Of growing virtue with its native trunk, Is now cut down and strew'd upon the grave! Gla. Judge him with mercy, heav'n! He was not taught Thy precepts of submissionâNature's child Will, with the God of Nature, meet forgiveness. [Curtain falls.</field>
