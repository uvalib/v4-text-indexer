      <field name="fulltext">To his truly Noble Friend Tho: Stanley Esq;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Troth Gentlemen, I know not what to say Now I am here, but you shall have a play; I hope there are none met but freinds if you Be pleas'd to hear me first, I'le tell you true, I doe not like the Prologue, 'tis not smart, Not aery, then the play is not worth aâ What witty Prologues have we heard? how keen Upon the tyme, how tickling o'the spleen? But that wits gone, and wee in these sad dayes In corse dull fleam, must preface to our playes, I'le shew you what our Author meant should be His Prologue,âGentlemen, he shall pardon me I dare not speak a line, not that you need To fear a satire in't, or wit in deed. He would have you beleeve no language good, And artfull, but what's cleerly understood, And then he robs you of much mirth, that lyes I'th' wonder, why you laugh at Comedies. He saies the tymes are dangerous, who knowes What treason may be wrapt in giant prose, Or swelling verse, at least to sense? nay then Have at you Mr. Poet, Gentlemen, Though he pretend fair, I dissemble not, Y'are all betray'd here to a Spanish plot But doe not you seem fearfull; as you were Shooting the bridge, let no man shift, or stir, I'le fetch you of, and two houres hence you may (If not before) laugh at the plot, and play.</field>

Thodoro, brother to Don Carlos Jacinta daughter to Don Carlos. Alsimira, a Noble Widdow. Felisarda, Teodoros Daughter. Physicians. Notary. Confessor. Servants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Madrid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Enter Francisco, Jacinta, Felisarda. Francisco. I take my leave Jacinta, and cannot wish you More happiness than you possess. Jacin. You must Dissemble, or it is within your wishes To make your self, Francisco, mine, which would be A fair addition to me, in my faith Of that most noble love you have profest. Fran. When you but dare to own me, I am past The fear of any destiny that can Enter Don Carlos and Servant Divide usâbut your Father. Your own virtue Be still your guard. I do not like this watch Upon our meeting, pretty Felisarda. Exit Car. Tel Signior Francisco I would speak with him I do not like his frequent visites: though His birth and generous parts deserve to march With men of honorable name, I am Without ambition to sacrifise My daughter to his pension for life. Enter Francisco Fran. Your pleasure sir? Car. Hath hitherto Francisco Been to affect you in the list of those I held my freinds. Fra. I hope no forfeit made By me, hath lost that good opinion You plac'd upon me. Car. I cannot tell How you may be transported with desires Above my thoughts t'allow, I would not have My silence, and the free access y'have had To my house, (which still is open to wise guests,) Betray me, or my Daughter to the mirth And talk of men i'th' Plassa, My estate Doth walk upon sound Feet, and though I make No exception to your blood, or person, sir, The portion I have fixt upon Jacinta, Beside the wealth her liberall Aunt bequeath'd her, Is more than your thin Younger brother's fortune Should lay a siege, or hope to. I am plain. Fr. And something passionate (if I understand you) Without a cause. I am a gentleman, With as much sense of honor, as the proudest Don that doth ride on's foot cloth, and can drop Gold to the numerous minutes of his age And let me not be lost for want of that, Deserves not to be nam'd to fill the ballance Against true honourâlet me tell you sir, Virtue and blood are weigh'd against themselves, You cannot know the price of these, when either Scale is not poiz'd with things of the same nature Car. Y'are very right, and therefore I do weigh My Daughters wealth against your fortunes sir, I take it they are things in the same specie, And find it easie to distinguish, yours Can hold small competition, and by A consequence that Fathers use t'inferre, As little hope to equall in affections. Sir I must tell you I esteem Jacinta Fit every way to meet your Elder Brother, Whose Birth will intrest him so much in that Full fortune which your Father now is Lord of, Your expectations may prompt you look Without much curiositie for a Bride, Fran. I shall believe thy soul is made of Atomes, That placeth so much happiness in Dust. aside Sir, I can quit your Jealousie, my thoughts Levell beneath your Daughter, and shall be Happie if you consent I may devote My applications to Felisarda, your Neece. Car. Is it my Neece? I ask your pardon. Nay then be welcome, and t'encourage you, Although her Father a poor Gentleman My brother, by the malice of the sea And winds, have lost what might have rank'd him even With some that ride upon their reverend mules, I'l find a portion for her, if you strike Affectionate heartes, and joy to call you Nephew. Pray be not angry, that I take a care To place my own, where I may see it answerd With State, as well as Family. Fran. You shew A provident Father. I shall not then B' indanger'd to your scruple, if I address My services to her, whose humble fortune, In the relation to your blood, and nobleness, Is wealth enough to me? Car. I wish it prosper. Fra. You have much honor'd me. Exit, Car. That scruple's vanish'd. These are considerings, with which Parents must Timely prevent the folly, and the fall Of Children, apt to lose themselves in shadowes And gaudy apparitions. Enter Servant. Ser. Your Son Is come from Salamanca Sir. Car. I hope Philosophy hath by this time tam'd his wildness, I have been carefull not to feed his riots. Hee's welcome; my next studie is to choose A wife for him, Servant, With him a Gentleman. That seems of noble quality. Enter Luys and Alberto. Luys. Your blessing, Next which 'tvvil be a happiness, if you Embrace this noble Gentleman Don, Alberto, To whose affection I have been engag'd. Alber. Our studies grew together, and our loves. Car. You do an honour to us. Lu. If he thrive Upon his fair intents sir to my Sister, Whose character he ha's took delight to hear From me sometimes, it will enlarge our honor. Car. He has improved in languageâhis estate? Lu. Six thousand ducats sir per Annum clear In his possession, beside The legacie of a Granam when she dyes That ha's outliv'd 6. cats within their family. Car. This tasts again of the old humor, hee's Not setled yet. Lu. Your pardon sir, I cannot With any patience think of an old woman, They are agues to my nature, she that lives To three score is a witch, and fit for fuell By the Civill law. I hope my mother's well. Sir I beseech you, be not you mistaken, I am not what I was, I'm strangely alter'd From the wild garbe, and can discourse most gravely Of any thing but old and toothless women. Do not you think it fit, she should be burn'd sir, That lives within an Hospitall till the roof Consume to dust, and no more left for covering Than is kept up in one continued Cobweb, Through which the birds may see her when she creeps Under a spiders canopie; what think you? Speak your own conscience. Car. A young wife will cure This angry heat of blood. You are most welcome, Command my house, and if you can affect My Daughter, for whose love (as my Son here Prepares me) you took this paines, I shall Make equall propositions. I knew Your Father well, Don Roderigo, who Gave up his life with honor 'gainst the Moores. Once more y' are welcome: Son Luys shew The way to your Sister, and bid her entertain Your friend with all the love her modesty, And my commands may prompt her to. Alber. You much oblige my services. Lu. Remember Don Conditions, if my Sister and you join Your coppiholds, I have a life must be Maintain'd till the old man dye, hang his pension, Two' not keep me in salads. I'le conduct you. Exe. Alb. &amp; Luys. Car. I like his person well, and his calm gesture Speakes for his other composition. The estate is competent, my Daughter is Obedient, which rich Parents call a blessing, Whose wisdom is to advance their name, and fortunes. Enter Don Ramyres My Son is all my studie now. My noble Don Ramyres, you look cheerfull. Ramy. 'Tis a good omen, I ha' buisnese w'ee Such as cannot despair your entertaiment; You have a Daughter. Car. I would you had one; I should be willing to translate a Son, And by his mariage be most proud to call Your Daughter mine. Ramy. You are next a Prophet, Signior, And but the Sexes differ, speak my thoughts; Tis harmony on both sides; to be short For let our gravities not waste time, and breath In our affaires, give the Young leave to court And spin out dayes in amorous circumstance; My Son Fernando, I need not call him Heir, His birth concludes it, I would commend To fair Jacinta: 't can be no dishonour To your Family to mix with mine. Car. Tis an addition Will add a luster rather to our blood. Ramy. Tis my affection to you Daughter, which confirm'd My observation of her virtue, makes Me with this tye between 'em; I may safely Expect you will assure a portion that His Fortunes will deserve, who must enjoy What I possess, unless you disaffect His person, or decline his education, Which hath not spar'd my coffers to advance him In the best form of Gentleman. Car. I want Abilities of tongue to answer this Your freedome, and the bounty of your nature, Towards my Daughter, and so far am from Exception to Fernando, there's no Cavalliero In Spain I wish to thrive so well in her opinion. Ramy. Twill be his encouragement, If he entrench upon no'others interest, I mean not to except, how well he can Deserve her nobly from a Rivall, if Her heart be not contracted, this were to Engage'em both to loss of Peace, and Honor, Perhaps betray a Life. Car. You argue nobly, She is yet Mistris of her thoughts, and free, While her Obedience doth keep in trust Her heart; till I direct it, which shall be To love, and choose your Son to live within it. Have I said home? Ramy. You have. When they have met We may conclude the Doury, and confirm Our mutuall assurances, till then farewel. Exit. Car. I like this well; Ramyres has A fortune for a Grande. Don Alberto Must now excuse me, if my vote preferre Fernando, whom my Daughter must accept Or forfeit me. The new guest is not warm In his access, and sha'not feel with what Soft art, and subtle wayes, I steer her passion; Yet were Alberto's state ten Maravides Above Ramyre's, I should place him first. Fame is an empty noise, Virtue a word There's not a Jew will lend two Ducate; on. He is return'd, I must prepare Jacinta. Exit. Enter Ramyres and Fernando. Fer. I hope my past life hath not sir so ill Deserv'd, you should be jealous of my duty When you command, although in things of this High nature, man being nothing more concern'd, Next the divine considerations, Than in the choyce of her that must divide The joyes and sufferings of his life, a Son May modestly insist upon the privilege That Love by his great charter hath conferr'd On every heart, not to be forc'd, yet I Freely resign my will, and what men call Affection, to that object you present me. Ramyr. Apply your self then to Don Carlo's daughter Shee's young, fair, rich, and virtuous, and I've had Full treatie with her Father, who expects Your visit. Fer. Young, fair, rich, and virtuous, Four excellencies seldom met in one; She cannot sure want servants, that commands Under so many titles. I could wish, (So much I have ambition to be thought Obedient sir,) she were but one of those. Ramy. She is all, and one. Fer. My duty were not less If I forgave my self a happiness To perfect your commands; sir, I am ready, To try my fortune. Ramy. There is no fear of thy repulse, and when Thou dost confirm her gain'd to thy affection, My greatest act, and care of life is over. Go on and prosper. Exit Fer. He is passionate, And like the fury of the winds, more loud By opposition; such a providence May be mine one day when I am a Father, And he for whose advance my cares are meant, Like me, may with a fair and formall shew Disguise his thoughts too, yet I am to blame, For my affection to a dream, a thing With which my eyes only converst, to hazard A Fathers love, and the rich peace it brings; Enter Francisco. I'l uncreate the face I dote upon And be my self, orâwhat? my brother? Now Francisco, you met my father? Fran. Yes, and he Lookes as some newes had much exalted him. You are not so merry in the face, what Is't? Ferd. Nothing. Fran. You held no controversies with him? Ferd. no. Fran. I cannot guess he was angry by his smiles; How did you part? Ferd. exceding kindly. Fran. What changes your complexion? Ferd. Th'art deceived. Pre'the' how do men look that are in love? Fran. Why? as they did before; what alteration Have you observ'd in me? Ferd. You have then a Mistris, And thrive upon her favours; but thou art My brother, I'l deliver thee a secret, I was at St. Sebastians last Sunday At Vespers. Fran. Is it a secret that you went to church? You need not blush to tell your ghostly Father. Ferd. I pre'thee leave thy impertinence; there I saw So sweet a face, so harmless, so intent Upon her prayers, it frosted my devotion To gaze on her, till by degrees I took Her fair Idea through my covetous eye, Into my heart, and know not how to ease It since of the impression. Fran. So, proceed. Fer. Her eye did seem to labour with a tear, Which suddenly took birth, but overweigh'd With it's own swelling, drop'd upon her bosome, Which by reflexion of her light, appear'd As nature meant her sorrrw for an ornament; After her looks grew chearfull, and I saw A smile shoot gracefull upward from her eyes, As if they had gain'd a victory o'r grief, And with it many beames twisted themselves, Upon whose golden threads the Angells walk To and again from heaven. Fran. I do beleeve By all these metaphors, you are in love; I see you have a fancie, but proceed, And be not melancholy. Ferd. I have told thee all. Fran. This is indeed a vision; you have But seen her all this while, if I may counsell you You should proceed, her face is nothing when You have perus'd the rest. Ferd. Tis dangerous. Fran. You must excuse me Brother, There can be no hurt in a handsome woman, For if her face delight so much, what will The enjoying of so sweet a pile of beauty? Ferd. Thou hast infus'd a confidence, I will Embrace this counsell, you shall with me Brother, And see how I behave my self, the Lady Is not far off. Fran. With all my heart, I'e pawn My life you shall enjoy her; what is she Of flesh, and blood, that will deny, when she Is fairly courted? may I know the name Of this lov'd Mrs? you may clear your thoughts, I dare have no design to wrong your love. Ferd. What think you Brother of the fair Jacinta? Fran. Don Carlo's Daughter? Ferd. To that happy coast I now am sayling; we lose time, clap on More wings thou feather'd God; thou hast put fire Francisco into my drooping thoughts, and as They had already bargaind with the wind, They are aloft, and chide loves lazie motion. Fran. A word before you fly; but is Jacinta Your Mistris then? Ferd. The beautifull Jacinta. Dost think I sha'not prosper? what is she Of flesh and blood, that can deny, when she Is fairly courted? add to this my happiness, That shee's the Mistris, whom, from all her sex My Father hath made choice of for my courtship; He hath already treated with Don Carlos, And 'twas his last command, I should address My present visit to her. Fran. Very well; If this be truth, you need not trouble wings To overtake this Lady, to my knowledge (I'm serious now) she has bestowd her heart Vpon a friend, who has already fortified Himself against the world, that would oppose His title to't. Ferd. From what intelligence Have you gaind this? her Father knows it not. Come, these are but subtle pretences scattered By some, who cunningly thus hope to make Themselves a victory, by cutting off More fruitfull expectations, this must Not disingage me, prithee walk. Fran. I can produce my Author, here, Fernando. And with my blood defend that interest She gave me, with intent I should preserve it. Ferd. How, is she yours Francisco? Fran. Mine, if hearts Have power to make assurance. Ferd. Tis some happiness I have no stranger to oppose, whose high And stubborn soul would not release this treasure But make me force it through his blood. Francisco And Fernando are two rillets from one Spring, I will not doubt he will resigne, to make Me fortunate; or should his will be cold And some close thoughts suggest I had no privilege By Eldest birth, but came a slie Intruder Upon his right of love, there is a tye Of Nature and Obedience to a Father Will make him give this blessing from his bosom, And strip his amorous soul of all his wealth That may Invest my wishes. Fran. I read not this In any of the reverend Casuists; No inequality being in our blood The law of nature meant we should be equal; It was first tyranny, then partiall custome, Made you more capable of Land. Would you Be lord of us, because you are first born, And make our souls your tenants too? when I've Nam'd you my Elder brother, I exclude All servitude; Justice that makes me love you Carries an equall law to both; Nay I can love you more if I consider you (Without the chain of blood) a freind, than all The bonds of nature can enforce me to; In both relations give me leave to love you As much as man, but not resign my Mistris. You ascend higher, and perswade by what Obedience is owing to a Father, They give us life, a good Son keepes it for him, And every drop bled in their cause, a glory; I can acknowledge this, and sacrifise Life, Fortunes, a poor recompence to lose (Were they all multipli'd) to shew my duty; But these are things may be resign'd, a Mistris Is not a wealth in ballance with the world, But much above the poize of all it's happiness, And equall with our honor, riveted Into our soul, it leaves her not, when death Hath shook this body off, but flies with it More swift, to love it in the other world. Ferd. You are very passionate. Fran. I am very just, And you shall find it brother e'r you twine With my Jacinta, mine, if vowes may give Possession of each other's soul. Ferd. No more May she be worthy of thy heart, till mine Do entertain a treason to divide you; But I, to satisfie my Father, must Present my self, and trust me, will so manage My love to her, as thou shalt have no cause To Interpret me a rivall. O Francisco Our loves are of a kindred, for mine is Devote to Felisarda, to her Cosen Poor Felisarda. Fran. Theodoros Daughter? Ferd. We never yet chang'd language, nor doth she Imagin with what thoughts I honour her; But here is the distraction, thou canst not Expect more opposition from Don Carlos, Than I must from my Father, if he knew Where I have plac'd my heart. Fran. Let us assist Each other then, till time, and some kind starres Mature our love. Ferd. Let Fathers look at wealth, tis all their Saint: Hearts are freeborn, and love knows no constraint.

I cannot Judge his Intellectualls, But we have plentie of more proper men In Spain. Luys He is an excellent Scholar, He was still Emperour in the Schooles, and since He studied Logick and Philosophy, He was the flow'r of's time at Salamanca. Iacin. Tis pittie he should be gather'd then. Lu. What be gather'd? Ja. The flower you talk on. Lu. If you affect him Sister, he may grow, And you may keep him still for seed please you. Ja. And sell him out at sowing time to Gardners. Lu. Come, you must love him. Ja. Ha's he the Black-art? I know not how Magick or Philters may Prevail, and yet he lookes suspitiously. Lu. You think y' are witty now, d'ee hear, you must Affect him for my sake. Ja. Now you speak reason; I may for your sake dote upon him, Brother, This is a conjuration may do much. Lu. Well said, Thou art my Sister, this good nature shews it. And now I'le tell thee, I ha' promis'd him As much as mariage comes too, and I lose My honor, if my Don receive the canvas. He ha's a good estate, and I have borrow'd Considerable monies of him Sister, Peeces of eight, and transitory Ducats. Ja. Which must be paid. Lu. Not if you marry him; Conditions have been thought on. Ja. How? conditions? Lu. And some revenew was convenient To do things like a Gentleman, I may Tell you, my Father is a little costive, Purse-bound, his pension cannot find me tooth-picks, I must live till he dye 'tis fit you know; Alberto ha's an Exchequer, which upon Thy smiles will still be open. Ja. Very good; Then you upon the matter have sold me to him To find you spending money? Lu. No, not sold; W' are at no certain price; summes have been lent In expectation, or so, and may again. Ja. You deserve Brother I should hate you now. Lu. 'Tis all one to me, so you love him; For my part I desire but my expences. Ja. What if another man supply your want: Upon the same conditions of my love? Lu. I am indifferent, so I have my charges, My necessary wine and women paid for, Love where you please your self; I am but one, I would not see him want that's all, because My Father is not yet resolv'd about His going to heaven. Ja. Well sir, for Don Alberto, You shall be his advocate no more, and there's A Fee to bribe your silence in his cause. Lu. Why, thank you sister,âwill you dye a virgin? Ja. Why do you ask? Lu. I would speak for somebody, tell me but whom You have a mind to, and I'le plead for him, And if he be a Don he will consider it; You may give me what you will, besides. Ja. When I Resolve, You shall be acquainted. Lu. But d'ee hear, Untill you do resolve, I would lose no time, 'Tis good keeping a freind, and a warm client; You may look lovingly upon Alberto, And let him hope at all adventures, in Two moneths you may be otherwise provided And he may hang himself, i'th meane time Some favours now and then to the poor Gentleman Will doe him good, and me no hurt, besides You'l please my Father in't, whose vote is for him, And that's a thing materiall. I am To meet with Don Alberto, and some Gentlemen, I will preserve his confidence, and tell him I ha' talkd with thee. Have you any more Of this complexion? cause I know not what Occasions I may have to keep my credit With men of mark and honour, vvhere I am going; You are my Fathers darling, and command His yellovv Ingots; tother Doblon D'oro. Ja. So I may bring a rent-charge upon my self. Lu. The tother drop of orient mercie, come. Ja. You care not vvhat accounts I give my Father. Lu. Thou hast tvventy vvayes to cosen him, vvedge it Into the next Bill, he vvears Spectacles, And loves to readâItem for pious uses. Can it be less to help a brother? well said. Ja. Let not this feed your riot. Luys. By no means. I am for no Carthusians to day. Enter Carlos, Fernando, Francisco, and Felisarda. Farewell dear Sisterâwho is that? Ja. My Father Lu. I cannot indure that old mans company. Exit Car. I am past complement, and must acknowledge Your fair intentions honor us, she is no Goddess Of beauty Sir, but let me without pride Boast my self blest, Fernando, in her virtues, And that which crowns em all, obedience: Jacinta, Entertain this Gentleman With all becoming thoughts of Love, his merit (Out of no rash, but mature judgement,) hath Prevaild with me, to name him to the first And noblest place within your heart. Ferd. Untill this hour I never had the confidence More than to think of love, and hide a flame That almost hath consum'd me. You may think It worth a smile, and that I only flourish To shew my vanity of wit or language, But when you understand that I bring hither No young affection, but a love took in Long since at my ambitious eye, it may Beget your gentle thought, or will, to cure me. Jac. Pardon me, if the more you strive to print A truth on this short story of your passion, The more I find my self inclin'd to wonder, Since you seem to inferre, You took in the Disease at sight of me, I cannot be So ignorant, as not to have receiv'd Your Name and Character, but never knew Before, when you did grace us with a visit, And how then at such distance you contracted A danger so consuming, is above My knowledge, not my pittie, if you could Direct me to the cure with Virgin honor. Car. So, so, I leave you to the amorous Dialogue, Presume you have my voice. Jac. Sir, with your pardon, You lead me to a Wilderness, and take Your self away, that should be guide; do you Engage me to affect this Don Fernando In earnest? Car. Yes. Jac. You did direct my love To Don Alberto. Car. I dispence with that Command; you may by fair degrees, and honor, Quit his addresses, and dispose your self Mistris and Bride to Don Ramyres heir. Felis. It does not thus become you sir, to mock A Virgin never injur'd you; he is Your elder Brother, I am here beneath The levell of his thoughts, i'th' nature of A servant to my Cosen, and depend Upon my Uncles charity. Fran. May I be Curst in my own affections, if I Delude thee, though to atchieve our best desires We seem to dissemble thus before Don Carlos. This is a secret yet to poor Jacinta. Car. You have my will; obey it. Ja. Hath Francisco broken his faith already? Car. May you both joy, where you have plac'd your loves. You apply close Francisco. Exit Fran. With your good favour, I fairly hope. Ferd. Your Father's gone Jacinta. Ja. I should be Equally pleas'd if you would leave me too. Felis. This is a change. Ja. Unkind Francisco hear me. Fran. Tis my meaning. Brother I ha' prepard Your story there with Felisarda; lose No time. Ferd. Jacinta, clear your thoughts agen, And pardon that I took a shape to fright you; I shall not grieve to see Francisco prosper, And merit all your favours, since my hopes Must thrive, or have their Funerall here. Ja. Are we So blest Francisco? th'ast a noble Brother. Ferd. I may suppose my Brother, Felisarda, Hath made it now no secret, that I love you; And since our stars have so contriv'd, that we Have means to assist our mutuall ambitions, Do not you make their influence unprofitable; Tis the first boldness I ere tooke to visit you, Although my eyes have often with delight And satisfaction to my heart observ'd you: Felis. You seem a noble Gentleman, and can take But litle glory to undo a Maid, Whose Fortunes cannot bring you any triumph. Ferd. How mean you fairest? Felis. Not to be flattered Sir Into a sin, to cure my poverty; For men whose expectations are like yours, Come not with honour to court such as I am, (Lost to the World for want of portion) But with some untam'd heat of blood. Fer. I dare With conscience of my pure intent, try what Rudeness you find upon my lip, tis chast As the desires that breath upon my language. I began Felisarda to affect thee By seeing thee at Prayers, thy vertue wing'd Loves Arrow first, and 'twere a sacrilege To choose thee now for sin, that hast a power To make this place a Temple by thy Innocence. I know thy poverty, and came not to Bribe it against thy chastity; if thou Vouchsafe thy fair and honest love, it shall Adorn my fortunes, which shall stoop to serve it In spight of friends or destiny. Fran. My Brother Knows my whole Interest in thee, to whom My Fathers care directed him, but we Thus mutually resolve to aid each other. Ja. This must be wisely manag'd of all sides; Parents have narrow eyes. Fran. Our meeting thus Will happily secure us from their Jealousie; Our Fathers must not know this countermarch. Enter Carlos. Car. Ha; I like not this; Fernando at busie courtship With Felisarda, and Francisco so Close with my Daughter. Jac. Las we are betrai'd. Felis. My Unkle. Ferd. You are her Kinswoman, and of her bosom, I prethee in my absence, plead to fair Jacinta for me; as an earnest of My gratitude, accept this trifle from me. Car. Ha, 'tis a Jewell. Felis. Without this reward I should solicite sir your cause, and do My duty to Don Carlos, who desires it. Ferd. I take my leave. Fran. Madam, I shall be proud To call you Sister, but you will prepare Another happiness if you vouchsafe To speak for me to pretty Felisarda, She's bound to hear your counsel and obey it, If I may owe this favour to your charity. Jacin. Your goodness will deserve more. Fran. I must follow him. Exit. Car. Do you take notice Felisarda, that You live here on the bounty of an Unkle? Your Father had but ill news from the Indies. Felis. Sir, as your goodness wants no testimony, I shall attend it with all humble services. Car. How durst you in the presence of my Daughter, Maintain such whispers with Fernando, ha? Felis. Sir, he was pleas'dâ Car. No more, I here discharge you. Jacinta, I'l provide one to attend you With less relation to your blood. I'l hear Of no defence, awayâout of my dores. Go to your Father Signior Teodoro: His ships may rise agen were sunk by th'Hollander, And Fleet from St. Thome, he may prefer you To some Rich Don, or who knows but you may, Born on the Plumes of his estate, be made In time a proud Condessa, so adios Mai illustre Sennora Felisarda. Exit. Ja. Thus have I heard a tall ship has been wrack'd By some strange gust within the Bay: his passion Admits of no dispute. O my poor Cose, I fear my turn is next to be an exile, Thy absence must deprive me of Francisco, Who can no more glad his Jacinta's eyes, With a pretence to visit thee. Felis. Tis not My fear to suffer want so much afflicts me, As that I must lose you, but he returnes. Enter Carlos with a Letter, and Servant. Car. Don Pedro de Fuente Calada comming hither, With Don Alberto, and my Son? Serv. Yes sir, the Count desires to see Jacinta Whom your Son has so commended, and sent me To give you notice. Car. Ha Iacinta, retire To your closet, and put on your richest Jewels, A Count is come to visit you; Felisarda There may be some more art us'd in her dress, To take the eyes of greatness. Iac. Sir you speak As I were meant for sacrifice, or sale; The Count Don Pedroâ Car. No reply; be carefull, And humble in your office Felisarda, And you may live, and eat here, till Iacinta Provide another servant to attend her, Which may be three whole dayes; my anger is Not everlasting; bid my Wife come to me. Enter Alsimira. I expect an honourable guest, the Count Don Pedro, To see our Daughter, whom I have commanded To appear with all her riches to attract him. Alsi. If his Intents be honourable, I have heard Don Pedro loves a hansom Donna. Car. He had better cool his hot blood i'the frosen Sea, and rise thence a rock of Adamant To draw more wonder to the North, than but Attempt to wrong her chastity. Enter Don Pedro, Luys and Alberto. This from Don Pedro is an honor binds The service of our lives. Ped. Noble Don Carlos. Alsi. If we had been prepar'd, we should have met This grace with more becoming Entertainment. Ped. Tis fair, and equall to my wishes,âshe He kisses Alsi Does smel of rosted Garlick; this your Sister? Enter Jacinta and Ferlisarda. Luys. That is my Mother, here is Jacinta Sir. Ped. She has a tempting shape, I now am pleas'd. I Use to kiss all; hum a pretty thing? To Phelis. Car. I like not his busie eyes on Felisarda. Alber. You will be faithfull to me? Luys. Who, I faithfull? how shall I live else? Car. Son Luys. Alber. Madam. Ped. Will you be pleas'd admit Don Pedro, by The Title of your servant, to presume Somtime to wait upon you. Jacin. It were pride And sawcy ambition sir in me, to think You can descend so much from your great birth, To own a name, and office so beneath you. Ped. I that before thought women easie trifles, And things which nature meant only to quench High flames in man, am taken with this Lady. Luys thou hast wrong'd the fair Jacinta, Thy praise was thyn, and cold, Spain is not rich Enough to boast her equall: and I love her. Luys. Oh she will be to proud to know it Sir. Ped. Proud, she must be, whose eyes have such command. She has a pretty servant too, Luys, I like 'em both. Luys. How, both? Ped. They will do well, One for a Wife, the other for a Concubine. Luys. It will becom your high blood. Ped. Say I kiss Her white hand, and present her with these Pearls? Luys. Your honor shall command. Ped. Your Daughter has a most magnetick face, And I pronounce her happy, your consent Confirmes her mine. Car. Ther's nothing in my blood, or fortune, but Don Pedro shall command. I was Propheticall? Come hither Alsimira, wouldst imagine? Hee's taken with Jacinta, and hath praid Already my consent. Alis. Believe not all That great men speak are Oracles, our Daughterâ Car. If she be stubborn, uncreates her self, Be you wise, and counsell her to this ambition, Or thus I loose you all; ha turn away, That Faery shees a Witch, the Count talks with her. Alb. I hope you hold me not Sir less deserving Than when you gave me free access to plead My service to your Daughterâif that Donâ Car. Sir you too much prejudicate my thoughts I must give due respects to men of honor, Nor is it fit I should impose upon The Freedom of Jacintas love. Alb. Y'are noble. Car. My Lord. Alb. I do not like this Don. Luys. Th'art of my mind, I do not like him neither, And yet the blackbirds in the bush, see what present he would give my sister. Alb. Did she refuse it? Luys. I never mean she shall, what wrong my friend? Yet I'l take all, and let him hang himself; (embraces him: If he would send his eyes, I would undertake To carry 'em to the Ieweller, they would off, For pretty toadstones. Have no fear, my Mother Is for you too, you must fee both your Advocates. Car. Jacinta. Jacin. Sir. Luys. She takes her self much honor'd. Ped. You oblige. Luys. Let me alone to carry things. Be confident to trust me with your honor, If it would pawn for any thing. [aside] Iac. I'm not perfect How to neglect Alberto yet, and must I Throw off Fernando, but new Entertain'd By your command? the World will censure strangely. Car. The World will praise thy wisdom, &amp; my care; Or if some giddy tongues condemn what's good, Must wee be servile to that fear, and lose That which will make us Judges of their folly, And damn it with a frown of state? they'r fooles That dote upon those shaddowes, Idle talk, The slime of Earth-worms, that doth shine to cosen Infants, 'tis fit wee raise our thoughts to substances. Jac. Let modesty and nature plead a little, If I appear not fond to Entertain him. I may collect more strength by time and counsell, And for your satisfaction dare profess My Lord hath too much grac'd the low Jacinta With a pretence so noble, but I should Be held not worth his person, and too light At his first breath of courtship to fall from, My Virgin strength, and give my self his captive. Car. I shall alow that ceremony; the Count Makes an address. Ex Alsi. Felisard. Ped. I must use thrift in my delight, my eyes Are prowd, and must be taught by absence how To value such a Mistris. I do miss the chambermaid. Car. It will become me to attend. Ex. Albex. &amp; Jacin. Ped. Your pardon. I'l take it for an honor, if your Sonne Be pleas'dâbut to my coach? Luys. Oh my good Lord! So much I am your creature, if you knew But where to match me, I would be your coach-horse. Exe. Pedro &amp; Luys. Car. So, so, Iacinta's starres do smile upon her, 'Twil be a match, were but my Son as fair In expectation of a bride, I'd write Nil ultra to my cares, he is to aery And volatile, a wife would timely fix him, And make him fit to manage my estate. Enter Luys. But he returnes, I'l feel his pulse. Luys, thou seest how near Iacinta is to happiness. Luys. I did some office in't, she may thank me. I first inspir'd his Lordship. Car. Such a providence To build thy self a Fortune by some brave And noble mariage would become thy study, And make thy Father willingly resign His breath, with confidence to know thee wise To govern what my Industry hath gatherd; What think'st thou of a wife? Luys. I think little sir. What should I do with a Wife? Car. Imitate me, and study fame, and wealth To thy posterity. Have I with care Acquir'd such an estate, that must not last Two Generations? Luys. The way to make it Last, is not to think of Wiving; for my part (Sir with your pardon, if I may speak freely) I had opinion once I was your Son, But fearing by your narrow exhibition You lov'd me not, I had a controversie Within my thoughts, whether I should resolve To geld my self, or turn a begging Frier. Car. A begging Frier? Luys. Tis as I tell you Sir; This last I fixt upon, and ha' been studying Where I conveniently might raise a sum To compass a hair shirt Sir, To make triall before I thrust my self Point blank into the Order. Car. Thus wild Sons interpret still A prudent Father; but you may discharge Your Jealousies, unless it be your own Devotion to be chast, and live a recluse. Luys. For that I can be ruld; I ha' not liv'd After the rate of hating any women But I can hear of Mariage, if it be Your pleasure: but these Wives Sir are such tickle Things, not one hardly staid amongst a thousand; Beside, unless you finde one very rich A man may cast a way himself, and get A bundle of Beggeries, Mouths, that day and night, Are open like Hell Gates, to feed; I would not Hazard my Freedom, and the blessings Heaven Has lent you Sir, upon a Wife with nothing. Car. Thy pension doubles for that word; in Earnest, How much I like this wisdom; take this Purse, I will have no account, and find me out A wealthy Maid or Widdow, but not ugly. Luys. No? not ilfavourd Sir, if she be rich? A little old or crippel'd? Car. I wo'not ha' thee Mary a crooked, deform'd thing, because She may have childrenâ Luys. Not, unless she have An Infinit wealth to make 'em strait sir; I'le marry a witch so she have mony sir. Car. No, on no terms a Monster. Luys. Then I wo'not. And now it comes into my mind, they talk of A young rich Widdow, Donna Estifaniar, What do you think of her? Car. Thou hast nam'd one To my own desires, she lives a Widdow still, But she has refus'd many brave Dons. Luys. No matter, I like her sir the better. Car. She gives good entertainment. Luys. I will have her If you but say the word. I wear a charm To catch a Widdow; but this Purse will hardly Last till we finish, I must do things with honor. Car. Thou shalt be furnish'd like my Son; kneel down And ask me blessing, I do long to give it thee. Luys. I have your blessing here. Car. Ile find thee out Some Jewells to present thy Mistris too. Luys. 'Two 'not be much amiss, the Gold will go The farther Sir. I know not how this Exit Car. Came about, unless Don Pedros coming to My Sister ha' made him mad, &amp; wrought this miracle. How carefull he was I should not mary one Deform'd, I ha' chose the hansomest things thus far, And I mary with a Witch at these years, let the Devill Ride my wild Mare to death; and now I Consider on't I wo'not have the Widdow For fear o'th' worst, yet I'l to her, And make a business on't to keep the old Mans Baggs in motion; this with some good Husbandry, and no play, may last a Fortnight, Tis very Gold: yes, it will pay some scores, Maintaine my Negro, and a brace of Whores. Now fiddles do your worst. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Enter Ramyres, Fernando. Ramy. How, no success? where lies the opposition? Don Carlos equall with my self profest His free desires, and to dispose his Daughter To meet thee with all loving entertainments. What can she argue to thy birth, or person, Attended with so plentifull a fortune? I must believe thy courtship dull and faulty: When I was at thy years and spring of blood I wound my self like air among the Ladies, Commanding every bosom, and could dwell Upon their lips like their own breath, their eyes Doubled their Beams on me, and she that was Of hardest composition, whom no love Could soften, when I came with charm of language, Her Frost would strait dissolve, and from her eyes Her heart came weeping forth to woo me take it. Ferd. Yet you that did with a Magnetick Chain Attract so many, could possess but one; I came not to Don Carlos house with cold Or lukewarm thoughts, but arm'd with active fire That would have melted any heart but hers, Bound up with ribs of treble Ice against me, By which I found there is another fate That governs love, against whose secret doom In vain is eloquence or force. Ra. So Obstinate? Ferd. Nothing that I could say In my own cause, could make her tongue or looks Promise an expectation to thrive By any after service, this disdain I did resent, as it became my honor, And now confirm'd against her pride, have thought Of somthing, that with your consent, may tame Her scorn, or punish it to her repentance. Ra. Name it. Ferd. She has a Kinswoman lives with her, Felisarda Daughter to Signior Teodoro, A trade fall'n Merchant, Brother to Don Carlos, This Felis. that now lives on the charity of her Uncle, Half servant, half companion to Iacinta, And fair, I would pretend to love, observe me sir, And in their presence court her as my Mistris; Me thinks I see already how Iacinta Doth fret and frown. Ra. I like it well. Ferd. To see her Cosen so prefer'd, it is The nature sir of women to be vext When they know any of their servants court Another, and that love they thought not worth Their own reward, will sting 'em to the soul, When ti's translated where it meets with love, And this will either break her stubborn heart, Or humble her. Ra. But what if this pretence, By such degrees convay away your heart, That when Jacinta comes to sense, you cannot Retrive your passion from the last, or say Felisarda should believe you, and give up Her heart to your possession, when you Are by your first desires invited back, What cure for Felisardas wound, if you Affect her not? although I like that part Of your revenge, I would not have my Son Carry the hated brand of cruelty, Or hear Fernando broke a Ladies heart; But live upon his clear, and honest truth, And if Jacinta have not valued him, Find his own estimation in some other By fair and noble Courtship; Virtue is Above the gaudy shine of Gold; and if My Son love where his honor cannot suffer, The want of Dower, I can forgive. Ferd. You now, read exc'lent charity, and like a Father, It is the harmony I would hear, I chide My fears that did suspect you would prefer Wealth in a Bride; there is no beauty, or estate, compar'd To that resulteth from the soul; I dare Now ope this narrow Closet, and present The name I love above the World, it is Sir Felisarda, equall in her blood, Within whose vertuous poverty More Treasures are containd, than in those veins Of earth, which opend by our slaves, do bleed Such floods of Gold into the lap of Spain. Pardon my long concealment of her name, Twas sin against your virtue, and once more Speak in that blessed Language, I may hope To call this Virgin mine. Ra. How long have you Been taken with this female holiness? Ferd. Before Jacinta was propounded, this Took firm possession of my faith. Ra. Thou hast discoverd thy destruction, foolish Boy. Was this your policy to be reveng'd Upon Jacinta, whom my providence Elected to preserve our name and family, To dote upon a Begger? thou hast flung A fire into my brain; either resolve To perfect my commands, and throwing off That crifle thou hast prais'd, prefer Jacinta To the best seat within thy hart, and marry her Or live a stranger to me, and divested Of all those rights, which nature, and thy Birth Have flatter'd thee with hope to find; expect not Alive, the slipend of a Groom to feed thee, Nor dead, the naked charity of a shroud To hide thee from the Worms. Ferd. O sir, call back That murdering sentence, it were sin to let This passion dwell upon you, nor would Heaven, Whose eyes survey our frailty, suffer So wild a rage possesse you. Ra. Tis within thy own obedience to divert it. Ferd. When you have heard what I can say more, You will chide your fierce command. Ra. What Riddles this? Ferd. Jacinta is already made anothers, and my force Upon her vowes, can be no less than sacrilege. Ra. This is some new pretence. Ferd. Sir, not to wast your patience, she hath given Her self by holy contract to Francisco. Ra. Thy younger Brother? Ferd. This I know will calm Your fury, and those eyes that threatend lightning With smiles applaud Franciscos fate, and praise My disobedience. Ra. Franciscos Mistris? Ferd. His wife confirm'd by vows, &amp; change of hearts, I had it from themselves, when either strove Whose circumstance should credit most their story, Her tear or his conclusive groan, to seal Their mariage, but both were equall sir, What curse had I deserv'd, that should divorce This Innocent pair of lovers? Ra. All this talk Which foolish thou interpret'st thy defence, Hath but inlarg'd thy folly, and that act Which in Francisco I commend, upbraides Thy own degenerate baseness: shall thy brother Who carries all his portion in his blood Look high, and carefull of his honor aim At fortunes, and with confidence atchieve His glorious end, and shall his Elder brother Ingag'd by nearest tye to advance his name, Lye beating in the common tract of guls, And sacrifice his birth and expectations To a cozening face, and poverty? instead Of adding mon'ments, that to the world Should be his living Chronicle, to bury His own, and all the antique honors (he Ne'r sweat for, but were cast into his blood) Within a dunghill? thou hast forfeited Thy birthright, which Francisco shall inherit, Nor shall the loss of my Estate be all Thy punishment; hear and believe with horror, If thou renounce not her that hath bewitch'd Thy heart, Felisarda, and by such a choice I shall affect, redeem this scandall nobly, Fernando from this minute I pronounce Heir to his Fathers curse; be wise or perish. Exit. Ra. Ferd. Why does not all the stock of thunder fall? Enter Francisco. Or the fierce winds from their close Caves, let loose, Now shake me into Atoms? Fran. Fy noble Brother, what can so deject Your Masculine thoughts? is this don like Fernando! Whose resolute soul so late was arm'd to fight With all the miseries of man, and triumph With patience of a Martyr? I observ'd My Father late come from you. Ferd. Yes Francisco, He hath left his curse upon me. Fran. How? Ferd. His curse, dost comprehend what that word caryes Shot from a Fathers angry breath? unless I tear poor Felisarda from my heart, He hath pronounc'd me heir to all his curses. Does this fright thee Francisco? thou hast cause To dance in soul for this, tis only I Must lose, and mourn, thou shalt have all, I am Degraded from my birth, while he affects Thy forward youth, and only calls thee Son, Son of his active spirit, and applauds Thy progress with Jacinta, in whose smiles Thou maist see all thy wishes waiting for thee, Whilst poor Fernando for her sake must stand An excommunicate from every blessing, A thing that dare not give my self a name, But flung into the Worlds necessities, Untill in time with wonder of my wants I turn a ragged statue, on whose forehead Each clown may carve his motto. Fran. Will it call His blessing back if you can quit your love To Felisarda? she is now a stranger To her Unkles house, I met one of his servants Who told me on some Jealous apprehension, Don Carlos had discharg'd and banish'd her. Ferd. He could not be so barbarous. Fran. You know her Fathers Poverty. Ferd. And her Wealth of Virtue. Fran. It is worth your Counsell, To examin what you may preserve, if wisely You could perswade your heart to love some notherâ Ferd. What was't Francisco said? Fran. Whose equall Birth, And Virtues, may invite a noble change. Ferd. Do not you love Jacinta? Fran. Most religiously. Ferd. If you can but contrive your hearts at distance, And in contempt of honor, and your faith Sacred to Heaven, and love, disclaim your Mistris, I may be happy yet, what say? I know Jacinta's Wise, and when she understands How much it will advance, her charityâ Fra. Our case is not the same with your's good brother; Wee have been long acquainted, to contract Affections, if I understand, your loves Are young, and had no time for growth. Ferd. Do not wound me. Tis false, by Love it self thou hast deserv'd I should forget thee now; dost thou consider Love, (that doth make all harmony in our soul, And seated in that noblest place of life, The heart) with things that are the slaves of time, And that like common seedes, thrown into Earth, It must have leisure to corrupt, and after Much expectation, rise to name and vigor. Love is not like the child that grows, and gets By slow degrees perfection, but created Like the first man, at full strength the first minute, It makes a noble choice, and gains from time To be call'd only constant, not increas'd. Preserve thy own affections, and think mine Noble as they, I shall suspect thy love To me else; prethee leave me. Fran. I'l obey, And study how to serve you. Exit. Enter Felisarda. Ferd. Ha, tis Felisarda. Felis. Turnd out like one that had been false, where shall Poor Felisarda wander? were it not To ask a Fathers blessing, I would visit Some Wilderness, e'r thus present my self His burden and his sorrow. Enter Pedro. Ped. Had you no relation to Jacinta pretty one? Felis. I was her servant. Ped. Come, you shall be my Mistris; they have us'd Thee scurvily, I will provide thee a lodging. Felis. I shall not use your bounty sir for that. Ped. Thou art a hansom Dona, here's a Pistolet, Meet me i'th' evening, wot? Felis. Where, and for what? Ped. The where, at thy own choice, the what, thy honor. Felis. You are not noble. Ped. Don Pedro will Embrace thy buxom body. Ferd. You must unhand this Virgin. Felis. For goodness Sir, Add not your anger to my sufferings. Unhappy Felisarda. Ped. Is she a friend of yours Signior? Ferd. She is not for your sinfull knowledge Don. Ped. Baser los manos, adios Signiora. Diabolo! My blood is high and hot, unless I marry timely, I must seek out a Female Julip. Exit. Felis. Don Carlo's fear of you was my first error, But I accept my banishment, and shall Humble my self to my poor Fathers Fortune; You will be sir dishonour'd to be seen With such a walking misery. Ferd. Thy Unkle Hath plaid the Tyrant with thee, but lose not Thy vertuous courage; how our stories meet And challenge kindred in affliction! Oh Felisarda! I do suffer too, And for thy sake, thou shalt know more; til I Salute thee at thy Fathers house, preserve Good thoughts of thy Fernando, and accept This litle Gold, no bribe against thy honor. Felis. My best return must be, my Prayers. Exit. Ferd. Farewell. Tis not impossible my Father may Retract his cruelty, and by time, and some Discreet wayes yet be wrought to like, what now His passion wo'not let him see, her virtue. How many Seas are met to wrastle here? Exit. Enter Jacinta and Alberto. Iac. I love you sir so well, that I could wish You were a Witch; Alb. A Witch, your reason Lady? Ja. Then twere within the circle of your art By some device to rid me of Don Pedro, Or if you could by any spell but get My Father disaffect himâ Alber. A Witch? thats a way about, I were best cut his Throat a little. Jac You're much beholding to my Brother sir, He still commends you; such an Advocate Deserves his fee. Alb. Unles my cause succeed He has been feed too much; your Brother, Lady, Preserves a noble friendship; if I were sure You would be mine Jacinta, I could tarry Till your Father dye. Iac. But how can you procure Don Pedro to have patience so long, Whom my Father pleads for and prefers? Alber. There, ther's the mischief, I must poison him; One Fig sends him to Erebus, tis in Your power and wit to spin out time, I may Invent a means for his conveyance. Ha! Enter Carlos, Estefania, Luys. Ia. The Lady Estefania. Car. Welcome again, This is an honour to us, where's Iacinta? Salute this noble Lady. Ha, Luys, Hast thou prevail'd already? Luys. I'm i'th' way you see, She has not been observ'd they say to walk So freely with some men that boast more favour. Enter Pedro. Ped. What makes the Lady Estefania here? I like not their converse, this day is ominous. Exit. Car. Was't not the Count Don Pedro that retird? What object here displeas'd him? Alber. Ha, ha, didst see the Don? Car. Preserve your mirthâI must be satisfied. Exit. Luys. I'l lay a thousand Ducats that my costive Don has been tampering with my VViddow, I Observ'd (when I by chance let fall discourse) How much he was an amorous servant to Iacinta, she chang'd her colour and did make Such business how my Sister did affect him, That I may guess, though I make use on't, otherwise To the old man, to keep the pulses of His Purse in play, she came to examin chiefly How matters here proceeded; well, if she love himâ Alber. Shee is thy Mistris. Luys. My Mistris? yes, but any man shall mary her. Alb. How? Luys. She is a Widdovv, Don, consider that, Has buried one was thought a Hercules, Two cubits taller, and a man that cut Three Inches deeper in the say, than I, consider that too, She may be cock a tvventy, nay for ought I know she is Immortall. Alb. What dost with her? Luys. Faith nothing yet, And have but little hope, I think shee's honest. Alb. Do's she love thee? Luys. At her ovvn perill, vv'are not come to articles; There is no vvit in vviving, give me a vvhore; But that I ovv thee money, thou shouldst never Marry my Sister neither? Alb. Not Jacinta? Luys. No, nor any other simpering piece of honesty, If I might counsell thee, while any wench Were extant, and the stewes inhabited; Is't fit, a Freeborn Gentleman should be chain'd Tenant for life to one? Hang mariage shackles, Ty the Tovvn Buls to'th' stake, vve must have concubins. Jac. Don Pedro was too blame, and trust me Madam He shall find nothing here t'advance his triumph. Estef. You are Virtuous Jacinta; I presum'd When I should land my sufferings on your knowledge, You vvould excuse my unexpected visit. Jac. My Brother has been Just in the relation Hovv he pursues my love, but I shall be Happy to serve your Justice, and must tell The noble Estefania, my heart, By all that love can teach to bind a faith, Is plac'd vvhere it shall never injure vvhat Your mutuall vovvs contracted; I smile not With mine ovvn eyes upon him, 'tis my Fathers Severe command to love him, but this story Cleer'd to my Father would secure us both. Estef. If any faith or service in me can Deserve this goodness, cheerfully employ it. Jac. I will be confident to use your Virtue. Enter Carlos. Estef. I will refuse no office. Jac. My Father comes most aptly. Alb. Ha, ha, ha, have pitty on my spleen, I shall crack a rib else, ha, ha, ha. Car. You are very mery, Don Alberto; Son, You may be of the counsell too, this house Is mine I take it, I advise you would Frequent it less. Alb. How Sir? Car. I do not like your visits, And to remove the cause, my Daughter is Already sir dispos'd, to one above Your birth and fortune, so fare-you-well. You understand, now laugh and pick your teeth. Daughterâ Alb. Did you hear this Luys? Luys. I, the old man raves. Alber. Must not frequent his house. Luys. Would 'twere in a flame, so his mony and I Were out on't. Alb. But thy Sisterâ Luys. Would be refin'd i'th' fire, let her burn too. Alb. My friend, if I have not Jacinta, There are certain sums of moneyâ Luys. I am not of your mind Don, the sums are most uncertain. Come, you did laugh too loud, my Father is A Stoick, but despair not; go to your lodging, I'l see thee anon, and either bring thee money Or else some reasons why I do not bring it, We won't go to Law, I'l pawn the widdow Rather than thou shalt want; go say thy prayers, And shew thy teeth no more, till I come to thee. Now the business here? Exit Alber. Car. Wee have agreed Jacinta, And he to morrow privately Will at the Church expect thee; tis an age Till I salute the Bride to this great Don, Whose thoughts are wing'd t'enjoy thee, and resolve No more delay, prepare to meet this Honor. Luys. To morrow? this must be crost. Car. My next ambition Madam will be perfect. To call you by some nearer name, my Sonâ Est. Is a most noble Gentleman, I know not Where lives so clear a merit. Luys. Oh sweet Madam. Car. Jacinta. Luys. I have a sute to you. Est. To me? Luys. Only that you would not dote too much upon me, A gentle easie sober pace in love Goes far, and is much better than a gallop; if you please We may hold one another in hand, and love This seaven yeares, without sealing and delivering. Est. Withall my heart. Luys. You'l do me a pleasure Madam. Est. You instruct well. Luys. This Courtship is not common. Est. I confess it. Car. Son Luys. Luys. Sir. Car. Let her not cool. Luys. And she do, I know the way to heat her again. Est. I will not yet reveal my abuse Iacinta, And if you please to favor a design, I have a plot may serve to both our happiness. Jac. I'l obey. There is a trembling in my heart. Car. You must not leave us yet Madam. Est. You may command me. Luys. My Don so rampart, ther's somthing in this pannier Shall spoil your match to morow; Don Alberto, When I disclose, shall worship me: be drunk, Cancell arreers, and beg to lend more money. Exe:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter Ramyres, Francisco &amp; Notarie. Ra. 'Tis most exactly done, and firm. Notar. I could, Omiting or inserting but a word, or particle, Trouble the whole conveyance, And make work for the law till doom's-day: butâ Fran. Is't possible? Notar You do not know the quirks of a Scrivano, A dash undoes a Family, a point, An artificiall accent i't'h wrong place, Shall poyson an Estate, translate your Land In Spain now into either of both Indies, In less time than our Gallions of Plate Are sayling hither; but you are my friend, And noble benefactor. Ramy. Ther's more for your reward. Notar. I humbly thank you Signior. Su Criado. Fran. Farewell. Notar. Su Servidor. Exit. Ramy. This deed makes thee my Heir Francisco, and Will like a powerfull spell upon Don Carlos, Whose soul is superstitious upon Wealth, Win his consent to make Iacinta thine. Fran. Sir, I cannot say my duty shall deserve it Since nature, and religion, without all This bounty challenges my best obedience. Enter Fernando. Ramy. Away, thy sight Is my disease. Fer. Your blessing sir I kneel for. Ramy. What Impudence is this? wilt thou subscribe To take off mine, thy curse on Felisarda? For I do hate her heartily; disclaim All promise, contract, or converse for ever, I'm else inexorable. Fer. Sir. Ramy. His eyes shoot poyson at me, ha? he has Bewitched me sure, what coldness thus invades me? Ther's somthing creeping to my heart. Franscisco? ha? Possess this gift of thy Inheritance; Convey me to my chamber, ohâFernando, If thou dost hope I should take off my curse, Do not approach my sight, unless I send for thee. Fran. Forbear good Brother; Diego, Roderigo, Your hands t'assist my Father, one go for his Physician. Enter two Servants. Fer. This turn is fatall, and affrights me, but Heaven has more charity than to let him die With such a hard heart, 'twere a sin, next his Want of compassion, to suspect he can Take his Eternall flight and leave Fernando This desperate Legacie, he will change The curse into some little prayer I hope, And thenâ Enter Servant and Physician. Serv. Make hast I beseech you Doctor. Phys. Noble Fernando. Fer. As you would have men think your art is mean Not to abuse mankind, employ it all To cure my poorsick Father. Phis. Fear it not sir. Ex. Phys. Serv. Fer. But there is more than your thin skill requir'd To state a health, your Recipes perplex't With tough names, are but mockeries, and noise, Without some dew from Heaven, to mix and make 'em Enter Servant. Thrive, in the application: what now? Ser. Oh sir, I am sent for the Confessor, The Doctor fears him much, your Brother saies You must have patience, and not Enter Sir; Your Father is a going, good old man, And having made him Heir, is loth your presence Should interrupt his Journey. Exit. Fer. Francisco may be honest, yet me think; It would become his love to interpose For my access, at such a needfull hour, And mediate for my blessing, not assist Unkindly thus my banishment. I'l not Be lost so tamely, shall my Father dye And not Fernando take his leaveâI dare not. If thou dost hope I should take off this curse, Do not approach untill I sendâ'twas so, And 'tis a law that binds above my blood. Enter Confessor and Servant. Make hast good Father, and if heaven deny Him life, let not his charity dye too. One curse may sink us both, say how I kneel And beg he would bequeath me but his blessing; Then though Francisco be his Heir, I shall Live happy, and take comfort in my tears, When I remember him so kind a Father. Confes. It is my duty. Exit. Fer. Do your holy office. Those fond Philosophers that magnifie Our human nature, and did boast wee had Such a prerogative in our rationall soul, Converst but little with the World, confin'd To cells, and unfrequented woods, they knew not The fierce vexation of community, Else they had taught, our reason is our loss, And but a priviledge that exceedeth sense, By nearer apprehension, of what wounds, To know our selves most miserable. My heart Enter Physician and Francisco. Is teeming with new fearsâHa, is he dead? Phy. Not dead, but in a desperate condition, And so that little breath remaines wee have Remitted to his Confessor, whose Office Is all that's left. Fran. Is there no hope of life then? Phys. None. Fer. Is he not mercifull to Fernando yet? no talk of me? Phys. I find he takes no pleasure To hear you nam'd: Francisco to us all He did confirm his Heir, with many blessings. Fer. And not one left for me? oh take me in Thou gentle Earth, and let me creep through all Thy dark and hollow crannies, till I find Another way to come into the World, For all the Air I breath-in here is poyson'd. Fran. Wee must have patience Brother, it was no Ambitious thought of mine to supplant you; He may live yet, and you be reconcil'd. Fer. That was some kindness yet Francisco; but I charge thee by the nearness of our blood, When I am made this mockery, and wonder, I know not where to find out charity, If unawares a chance direct my weary And wither'd Feet to some fair House of thine, Where plenty with full blessings crowns thy table, If my thin face betray my want of food, Do not despise me, cause 'I was thy Brother. Enter Confessor. Fran. Leave these imagin'd horrors, I must not Live when my Brother is thus miserable. Fer. Ther's somthing in that face looks comfortably. Confes. Your Father sir is dead, his will to make Francisco the sole Master of his Fortunes Is now irrevocable, a small Pension He hath given you for life, which with his blessing Is all the benefit I bring. Fer. Ha, blessing; speak it agen good Father. Confes. I did apply some lenitives to soften His anger, and prevail'd; your Father hath Revers'd that heavy censure of his curse, And in the place bequeath'd his prayer and blessing. Fer. I am new created by his charity. Confes. Some, ceremonies are behind, he did Desire to be interi'd within our Covent, And left his Sepulture to me, I am confident, Your pieties will give me leaveâ Fran. His will in all things I obey, and yours Most reverend Father; order as you please His Body; wee may after celebrate With all due obsequies his Funerall. Fer. Why you alone obey? I am your Brother: My Fathers Eldest Son, though not his Heir. Fran. It pleas'd my Father sir to think me worthy Of such a title, you shall find me kind, If you can look on matters without Envie. Fer. If I can look on matters without Envie? Fran. You may live here still. Per. I may live here Francisco? Enter a Gentleman with a letter Conditions? I would not understand This Dialect. Fran. With me, from Madam Estefania? Gent. If you be Signior Francisco. Fer. Sleighted? I find my Father was not dead till now. Croud not you Jealous thoughts so thick into My Brain, lest you do tempt me to an Act Will forfeit all agen. Fran. This is Jacintas character [Reads]âFail not to meet As you timely will prevent the danger of my rape. My soul! Estefania can instruct you all particularsâ My service to your Lady, say I shall obey her commands. Exit Gent. Fer. Is that an Inventory you peruse? Fran. Fernando you must pardon me, ther's somthing Of Essence to my life, exacts my care, And person, I must leave you, we may seasonably Confer of things at my return. Jacinta. Exit. Fer. Tis clear I am neglected, he did name Jacinta too, in triumph, and is gone, Big with his glories to divide 'em there, And laugh at what my constant love hath made-me. My heart is in a storm, and day growes black, Ther's not a star in Heaven will lend a beam To light me to my ruine. Felisarda! That name is both my haven, and my shipwrack. Exit. Enter Alberto and Luys. Alb. Excellent. Luys. You'l give me now a generall release For all the sums I ow you? Alb. Thou hast blest me. Luys. I was born to do you good; about it presently Now you know where to ambush, away I say And get comrads: Jacinta and my Mother Is all the carriage, you may know the coach By the old womans cough ere it come neer you, She has a desperate malice to one tooth left Still in her gums, till she has shook that out; You wo'not need a warning peece, farewell. Alb. Farewel, why whats the matter? you shanot leave me; Thy Mother wo'not know thee in a Visard. Luys. You must excuse me friend, I would Joyn w'ee I'th' surprise, but thatâ Alb. What I prethee? Luys. I have extraordinary business, that concerns me As neer as life. Alb. May not I know't? thou art going To the Widdow now, thy Mistris. Lu. Tis a business of more consequence; Dost think I would leave thee, and there were not Such a necessity? Alb. For what? Luys. And there were no more Sisters in the World, You must excuse me. Alb. Nay, nay, we must not part, unless I know This mystery, some reason vvhy you leave me. Luys. If you will needs knovv, there's a vvench staies for me, The toy I told thee on; farewell Alberto. Alb. But vvill you leave such business and a friend? Luys. Business? art thou a Gentleman &amp; vvouldst have Me leave a Ladie I ha'not seen this three year For business or a friend? I must to her; if I had a heart Ten Tun of Iron, This Female Adamant vvould dravv it to her, I feel it going; I do tell thee Don, There is no business so materiall In nature as a vvench, and if thou art my friend Thou vvouldst leave my Sister novv in such a cause And bear me company, I must be drunk, And she must pick my pocket too, that is Another secret vvhen vve meet together That never failes. Alb. Why art thou desperate? Dost not thou fear thy body? Luys. A wench is Physick My body has been us'd too, leave thy prating, And let me take my course. Alb. And you be so resoluteâ Luys. I must give you one advice before you go; When my Sister's in thy custody, observe The time and place, and things convenient, And stand not fooling about ceremonies But put her to't. Alb. Thou wouldst not have me ravish her? Luys. Yes but I would, Shee's no Sister of mine if she cry out For such a business, she has more wit. Alb. Was ever such a mad-cap. Luys. I'l not pray for thee. Alb. I sha'not prosper if thou dost. Luys. Thy hand, Ile drink thy health, &amp; hang thy self. Farewell. Exeunt. Enter Iacinta and Estefania. Iac. You tell me wonders Madam, Don Ramyres Dead, his Son Fernando disinherited, And young Francisco made his heir? Estef. I took Franciscos word. Jac. Tis strange. Estef. Your stars smile on you. Iac. Yet I much pitty the poor Gentleman. Est. Busie your thought about your own, Franciscoâ Ia. Hath promis'd not to fail? Est. He waits where he can easily observe How soon the coast is clear to visit you. Ja. So, so, thus hooded The day cannot distinguish our two faces, And for your voice, you know how to disguize it By imitation of my cold and hoarseness, And when you come to Churchâ Este. Let me alone, there I'l produce the Contract, Which will surprise Don Pedro, and your Father, To see me challenge him, I ha' prepar'd the Priest too, Whose holy Eloquence may assist, how ever This will give you opportunity to perfect Your wishes with your servant, put the rest To fate Jacinta. Jac. I hear some approach, retire into my Closet.â Enter Carlos and Pedro. Car. Jacinta. Jac. Sir. Car. Not thy voice recover'd? Ja. A violent coldâ. Car. Count Pedro must salute you ere we go. Pedro. Impute it to devotion, that I make Such hast to be within thy armes, One kiss and I shall carry with me Another soul, and count with Joy the minutes I am to expect this happiness. Car. Jacinta you follow with your Mother in the Coach; My Lord I wait you. Ped. Ther's Heaven upon her lip. Iac. He has kist, and took his leave I hope. Enter Estefania. I must owe all my happiness to you sweet Madam, I had been lost without your art to help me. Este. Love wo'not leave his votaries. Cough within. Iac. I hear my Mothers cough, I ha' finish'd And you must act your part: Exit. Enter Alsimira. Als. Come are you ready Daughter? the Coach stayes. Esty. I attend Alsi. Don Pedro will cure your cold before the morning. Enter Francisco and takes away Iacinta. Enter Teodoro and Felisarda. Teo. What duty Felisarda shall we pay To Heaven for this last care of us? Let not thy eyes, Although thy grief become 'em, be in love With tears, I Prophesie a joy shall weigh Down all our sufferings, I see comfort break Like day, whose forehead chears the world; if Don Fernando love thee, he is a Gentleman, Confirm'd in all that's honorable, and cannot Forget whom his own vertue hath made choice To shine upon. Felis. Unless my Innocence, Apt to believe a flattering tongue, see not The Serpent couch, and hide his speckled brest Among the flowers; but it were sin to think He can dissemble, Father, and I know not, Since I was first the object of his charity, I find a pious gratitude disperse Within my soul; and every thought of him Engenders a warm sigh within me, which Like curles of holy Incense overtake Each other in my bosom, and enlarge With their Embrace his sweet remembrance. Teo. Cherish Those thoughts, and where such noble worth invites, Be bold to call it love. Felis. It is too much Ambition to hope he should be just To me, or keep his honor, when I look on The pale complexion of my wants; and yet Vnless he loves me dearly, I am lost, And if he have but mock'd me into faith, He might as well have murdered me, for I Shall have no heart to live, if his neglect Deface what my affection printed there. Teo. There is no feare of his revolt, lose not His character. I must attend some business. If Don Fernando visit thee, preserve His fair opinion, and thou maist live Above thy Uncles pitty. Felis. Will you leave me? Teo. My stay shall not be long; the Garden will With smiling flowres encourage thee to walk, And raise thy drooping eyes, with hope to see A spring like theirs, upon thee. Exit. Felis. Why should I Give any entertainment to my fears? Suspicions are but like the shape of clouds, And idle forms i'th' air, we make to fright us. I will admit no jealous thought to wound Fernandos truth, but with that chearfullness, My own first clear intents to honour him Can arm me with, expect to meet his faith As noble as he promis'dâHa! tis he. Enter Fernando. My poor heart trembles like a timerous leaf, Which the wind shakes upon his sickly stalk, And frights into a Palsey. Fer. Felisarda! Felis. Shall I want fortitude to bid him welcome? Sir, if you think there is a heart alive That can be gratefull, and with humble thoughts, And Prayers reward your piety, despise not The offer of it here; you have not cast Your bounty on a Rock, while the seeds thrive Where you did place your Charity; my joy May seem ill drest to come like sorrow thus, But you may see through every tear, and find My eyes meant Innocence, and your hearty welcome. Fer. Who did prepare thee Felisarda thus To entertain me weeping? sure our soules Meet and converse, and we not know't; there is Such beauty in that watry circle, I Am fearfull to come neer, and breath a kiss Upon thy cheek, lest I pollute that Cristall, And yet I must salute thee, and I dare With one warm sigh meet, and dry up this sorrow. Felis. I shall forget all misery; for when I look upon the World, and race of men, I find 'em proud, and all so unacquainted With pitty to such miserable things As poverty hath made us, that I must Conclude you sent from Heaven. Fer. Oh do not Flatter Thy self poor Felisarda; I'm Mortall, The life I bear about me is not mine, But borrow'd to come to thee once again, And ere I go, to clear how much I love theeâ But first I have a story to deliver, A tale will make thee sad, but I must tell it, There is one dead that lov'd thee not. Felis. One dead That lov'd not me? this carries sir in nature No killing sound; I shall be sad to know I did deserve an Enemy, or he want A Charity at death. Fer. Thy cruell Enemy, And my best friend, hath took Eternall leave And's gone, to heaven I hope, excuse my tears, It is a tribute I must pay his memory, For I did love my Father. Felis. Ha! your Father? Fer. Yes Felisarda, he is gone, that in The morning promis'd many years, but death Hath in few hours made him as stiff, as all The winds, and winter, had thrown cold upon him, And wisper'd him to marble. Felis. Now trust me, My heart weepes for him, but I understand Not how I was concern'd in his displeasure; And in such height as you profess. Fer. He did Command me on his blessing to forsake thee; Was't not a cruell precept, to inforce The soul, and curse his Son for honest love? Felis. This is a wound indeed. Fer. But not so mortall; For his last breath was Balsom pour'd upon it, By which he did reverse his malediction; And I that groan'd beneath the weight of that Anathema, sunk almost to despair, Where night and heavy shades hung round about me, Found my self rising like the morning Star To view the World. Felis. Never I hope to be Eclips'd agen. Fer. This was a welcom blessing. Fe. Heaven had a care of both; my joyes are mighty. Vouchsafe me sir your pardon if I blush And say I love, but rather than the peace That should preserve your bosom, suffer for My sake, 'twere better I were dead. Fer. No, live. And live for ever happy, thou deserved'st it. It is Fernando doth make hast to sleep In his forgotten dust. Felis. Those accents did Not sound so cheerfully. Fer. dost love me? Felis. Sir. Fer. Do not, I prethee do not, I am lost, Alas I am no more Fernando, there Is nothing but the Empty name of him That did betray thee, place a guard about Thy heart betime, I am not worth this sweetness. Felis. Did not Fernando speak all this? alas He knew that I was poor before, and needed not Despise me now for that. Fer. Desert me goodness When I upbraid thy wants. 'Tis I am poor, For I ha' not a stock in all the World Of so much dust, as would contrive one narrow, Cabin to shroud a worm; my dying Father Hath given away my Birthright to Francisco, I'm disinherited, thrown out of all, But the small Earth I borrow, thus to walk on; And having nothing left, I come to kiss thee, And take my everlasting leave of thee too. Farewell, this will perswade thee to consent To my Eternall absence. Felis. I must beseech you stay a little sir, And clear my faith. Hath your displeased Father Depriv'd you then of all, and made Francisco The Lord of your Inheritance, without hope To be repair'd in Fortune? Fer. 'Tis sad truth. Felis. This is a happiness I did not look for. Fer. A happiness? Felis. Yes Sir, a happiness. Fer. Can Felisarda take delight to hear What hath undone her servant? Felis. Heaven avert it. But 'tis not worth my grief to be assur'd That this will bring me nearer now to him Whom I most honor of the World; and tis My pride, if you exceed me not in Fortune, That I can boast my heart, as high, and rich, With noble flame, and every way your equall, And if you be as poor as I Fernando, I can deserve you now, and love you more Than when your expectation carried all The pride and blossoms of the spring upon it. Fer. Those shadowes will not feed more than our fancies; Two poverties will keep but a thin table; And while wee dream of this high nourishment, Wee do but starve more gloriously. Felis. 'Tis ease. And wealth first taught us art to surfet by; Nature is wise, not costly, and will spread A table for us in the Wilderness; And the kind Earth keep us alive, and healthfull, With what her bosom doth invite us to; The brooks, not there suspected as the Wine That somtime Princes quaff, are all transparent, And with their pretty murmurs call to tast 'em. In every tree a Chorister to sing Health to our loves, our lives shall there be free As the first knowledge was from sin, and all Our dreams as Innocent. Fer. Oh Felisarda? If thou didst own less Virtue, I might prove Unkind and marry thee, but being so rich In goodness, it becomes me not to bring One that is poor, in every worth, to wast So excellent a Dower, be free, and meet One that hath Wealth to cherish it, I shall Undo thee quite, but pray for me, as I, That thou maist change for a more happy Bridgroom; I dare as soon be guilty of my death, As make thee miserable by expecting me. Farwell, and do not wrong my soul, to think That any storm could separate us two, But that I have no fortune now to serve thee. Felis. This will be no exception sir, I hope, When wee are both dead, yet our bodies may Be cold, and strangers in the Winding sheet; We shall be married when our spirits meets. Exeunt.</field>

Enter Alberto and Estefania. Alb. Pardon my dear Jacinta, It was love That threw me on this act, I had no patience To see thee forc'd into a mariage By a covetous Father, whose devotion Is only Wealth and Title; I esteem No danger, if at last the fair Jacinta Smile and allow this duty; let not silence Deprive me longer of thy voice, whose every Accent will please, though it pronounce my sentence; There's death in this Eclipss too, sweet dismiss Thy ungentle veil, and let thy eyes make bright This melancholy air, that droops and dies For want of thy restoring beams.

I come to seek one, that I late call'd Brother, But he hath forfeted that Name, and Justice Weary of such a prodigy in nature Hath arm'd me thus in her revenge, Don Carlos, Obscure him not, no darkness can protect him, My sword shall forrage every room like lightning, No Cave but it shall visit, and through ribs Of steel compell my passage to his heart, Although I meet him in his Mistris Armes, The lovers Sanctuary, I dare force Francisco, And vvith my Sword cut the Embrace that chains him, Rather then he shall glory in my ruines, And revell out, those honors, vvith her, he Took from my blood. Enter Francisco with a Parchment. Fra. It shall not need Fernando. Ped. Hum, here is like to be a bloody business, I'l not disturb 'em. Exit. Car. As you are Brothers, by your Fathers dust That should sleep quiet in his Urne, by her Dear name that gave you life, that novv prayes for you, Chide this unnaturall furie. Fra. VVhat demands Fernando? Fer. My inheritance wrought from me By thy slie creeping to supplant my birth, And cheat our Fathers easie soul, unworthily Betraying to his anger for thy lust Of wealth, the love and promise of two hearts, Poor Felisarda and Fernando now Wither at soul, and rob'd by thee of that Should cherish virtue, like to rifled Pilgrims Met on the way, and having told their story, And drop'd their even teares for both their loss, Wander from one another. Fra. Tis not sure Fernando, but his pasion (that obeys not The counsel of his reason) would accuse me, And if my Father now, since spirits lose not Intelligence, but more active when they have Shook off their chains of flesh, would leave his dwelling, And visit this course orbe agen: my Innocence Should dare the appeal, and make Fernando see His empty accusations. Fer. He that thrives By wicked art, has confidence to dress His action with simplicity, and shapes To cheat our credulous natures, tis my wonder Thou durst do so much injury Francisco As must provoke my Justice, to revenge, Yet wear no Sword. Fra. I need no guard, I know Thou darst not kill me. Fer. Dare I not? Fra. And name thy cause, tis thy suspition not Francisco Hath wrought thee high and passionate, to assure it, If you dare violate, I dare possess you Withall my title to your Land. Car. How is that? Will you resign the interest to such A fair Estate, and wrong my Daughter sir? Fra. Let him receive it at his perill. Fer. Ha! Fra. It was my Fathers act, not mine, he trembled To hear his curse alive, what horror will His conscience feel, when he shall spurn his dust, And call the reverend shade from his blest seat, To this bad World again, to walk and fright him? Car. I am abus'd Fer. Can this be more than dream? Fra. Sir you may cancell it, but think withall How you can answer him that's dead, when he Shall charge your timorous soul for this contempt To nature and Religion, to break His last bequest, and breath, that seal'd your blessings? Car. These are fine fancies. Fer. Here, and may it prosper, Where my good Father meant it, I'm orecome. Forgive me, and enjoy it, I may find Some Earth that is not thine, where I may dy And take up a dark Chamber, love Jacinta, And while I seek out where to be forgotten Live happy, and devide the spring between you, Enter Ramires, Felisarda, and Teodoro, a loof. Fra. So, so, all's well agen. Ram. Fernando stay. Fer. Ha, my Father and Felisarda? Car. Don Ramyres and my Neece? Fer. Are they both dead? [Fer. Kneels. I dare kneel too, they do converse. Don Carlos! Do not you know that shape? 'tis wondrous like Your Neece. Car. And that your Father, ha! Fer. How long hath Felisarda been a sad Companion to the shades? I did not think To find thee in this pale society, Of ghosts so soon. Felisar. I am alive Fernando, And Don Ramires still, thy living Father. Fra. You may believe it sir, I was o'th' counsell. Fer. It is a joy will tempt me, wish to live Here, without more ambition to change For blessings of the other World; and is My Father willing that wee both should live? Car. Men thought you dead. Ramir. It lay within the knowledge of Francisco and some few By this device to advance my younger Son To a Mariage with Jacinta sir, and try Fernando's Piety and his Mistris Vertue, Which I have found worth him, and my acceptance, With her I give thee what thy birth did challenge. Receive thy Felisarda. Fer. 'Tis a joy, So flowing, it drowns all my faculties, My soul will not contain I fear, but lose And leave me in this extasie. Car. I am cheated. Ra. Not so, what dower you add above that fortune, Descends upon her by your Sisters Legacie Francisco shall deserve, with a proportion Enter Francisco and Jacinta. Out of my state; live, and be happy both, You shall not want a Father in my care. Our children thus increas'd Don Carlos, 'tis Our shame if we neglect 'em; Teodoro You now may call me Brother. Thes. I'm honor'd. Car. Well, take my blessing too, love her Francisco. My bounty is to come, and if my Son But finish with his Mistrisâhee's return'd, Enter Luys. Where is the Widdow? Lu. Sure enough. Car. And Don Alberto. Lu. I ha made him sure too, I ha pepper'd him. Car. How? Lu. In your ear, I ha cut his throat, do none persue me? Car. I hope thou hast not kil'd him? ha! Lu. You hope to late, I could not help it, you said He was my Rivall. Car. Not to loud. Lu. Where, where shall I obscure me, the Alcaides Will be here presently, and search for me. I left him giving up the ghost, at a cranny I made into his side, through which a man Might see into his midriff. Car. Art thou desperate? Lu. Beside one window that did look into his lungs, From whence his wind came strong enough, In six hours sail to dispatch a Carrack to the straightes. Car. I'm mad. Lu. I should neglect my life, but 'twould not sound well With your honor that Don Carlos Son was hang'd, Or put into the Gallies; are they not come yet? Car. I am undone, there is no safety here, Make fast those doors, and by the Postern gate Thou maist escape, take the best Horse, away. Lu. I shall want money sir. Car. Come follow me? This accident I fear will quite distract me. Lu. You must dispatch me quickly sir, there is No staying to tell the money, gee't me in lump, I'l count it afterwards, good sir make hast. Exit. Lu. &amp; Car. Ra. Something hath hapned that doth fresh Perplex him. Fra. Where is Don Pedro? Enter Pedro. Fer. Hee's here. Ped. The storm is over sure, I hear no noise, Toledos are asleep, Jacinta? have I found my love? Fran. Here 'twas lost indeed, I must allow no such Familiarity With my Wife. Ped. How? married? Ja. 'Tis most true my Lord. Ped. You have not us'd me thus? Fra. It had been Impious to divorce your heart From Estefania; My good Lord, wee know Your Lordship is religious in your promises. Ped. I defy all Estefanias, Lady you are civill. To Felis. Fer. It will become my care so to preserve her My Honorable Count. Ped. Honorable? It appeares not by these contempts. Ramyr. Your Lordship cannot want a Female Furniture. Enter Alberto and Estefania. Ped. I must have some body now I'm prepar'd, my blood Will take it ill, would I had Estefania; Shee's here, Madam I hope you have A better faith than to believe I was in Earnest, Don Pedro is only at your service. Este. 'Tis too late sir, this Gent. is witness, Of your surrender, and is now possest Of all that's mine. Al. It was your Noble bounty, For which I cannot study a return More apt than to resign to your good Lordship, My Interest in Jacinta, give you joy Count. Such a rich Widdow serves my turn. Ped. So so, If I consider well this is but Justice. Enter Carlos. Car. Ha, are not you Don Alberto: fetch back Luys. Al. The very same sir, and this Lady is my Wife, Please you salute her. Enter Luys. Luys. Sir for the credit of your wisdom talk not, The man you see's alive and married too, With my consent, alas I ow'd him mony, That Widdow has paid all, I must be honest, I had no heart to leave you so unsatisfied, These sums must go for other debts, My debts do clog my conscience, and are better When they are timely paid sir, then let run With their long Teeth to bite your state hereafter, And if when I am free you dare but trust meâ Car. Was ever Father cheated thus, come hither, How darst thou be so impudent? Lu. I cannot help it sir, unless you dye Or give me better means, I shall make bold With these devices, you are my Father sir, And I am boundâ Car. To cosen me? Lu. All must be mine, and if I pay my self a little before the day, You shall be no loser when you come to reckon, This sha'not make a breach twixt you and I, They are honest men I ow this money too, When I am cleer prescribe me any method And rank me like your son, I will deserve You shall forget my wildness, and acknowledge me A convert without blemish to your family. Rami. I must be Intercessor. Jacin. And we all. Car. I'l think upon't. Ped. Since I cannot have Jacinta, I desire I may have her Brother. Lu. Not in marriage. Fed. I like his wit, his spirit, and his humor, Do not you love a wench? Lu. Yes sir. Ped. Thou sha't never want. Lu. Wenches? Ped. Wee'l live together, and, if thy Father Be not bountifull, thou shalt command my fortune. Lu. You speak nobly. Ped. Ladies, I ask your pardon Unless you hold me desperate, disdaine not That I may this day wait upon your triumph, And to each Bride offer some guift to expiate My folly and offence. Rami. You are too bountifull. Car. Y'are all my guests to day. Rami.
