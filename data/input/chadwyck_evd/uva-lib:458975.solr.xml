      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, THE LADY Dorothea Shirley. Madame, who make the glory of your blood No priviledge at all to be lesse good; Pardon the rudenesse of a Comedy, That (taught too great ambition) would fly To kisse your white hand, and receive from thence Both an authority, and innocence. 'Tis not this great man, nor that Prince, whose fame Can more advance a Poem, than your name, To whose cleere vertue truth is bound, and we, That there is so much left for History. I doe acknowledge custome, that to men Such Poems are presented; but my pen Is not engag'd nor can allow too farre A Salick Law in Poetry, to barre Ladies th'inheritance of wit, whose soule Is active, and as able to controule, As some 'usurpe the Chaire, which write a stile To breath the Reader better than a mile; But no such empty titles buy my flame; Nor will I sinne so much, to shew their name In print; some servile Muses be their drudge, That sweat to finde a Patron, not a Iudge. To you, great Lady, then, in whom doe meet Candor and Iudgement, humble as your feet I vow these Papers, wishing you may see Ioyes multiplied, to your eternitie. Your Honors devoted Seruant, Ia. Shirley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologus. That Muse whose Song within another Spheare Hath pleased some, and of the best, whose eare Js able to distinguish straines that are Cleare, and Phebean, from the popular; And sinfull dregs of the adulterate braine, By mee salutes your Candor once againe; And begs this noble favour, that this place. And weake performances may not disgrace His fresh Thalia; 'las our Poet knowes Wee have no name, a torrent overflowes Our little Iland, miserable wee, Doe every day play our owne Tragedy: But 'tis more noble to create than kill, Hee saies, and if but with his flame, your will Would fayne, wee may obtaine some Warmth, and prove Next them that now doe surfeit with your love. Encourage our beginning, nothing grow Famous at first, and Gentlemen, if you Smile on this barren Mountaine, soone it will, Become both fruitfull and the Muses hill.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus Scena primas. Enter at one doore Sir Iohn Wood-hamore, and Master Goldsworth, at the other M. Gerard, and Master Yongrave. Golds. I heard your Neece, Sir, was not well, you should incourage her to take the aire some times. Woo. Indeed shee's somewhat melancholy, and keepes Her chamber: Gol. 'T may prove inconvenient for Her health, does she not languish for a husband? Take heed oth'greene disease. Woo. I'le finde a cure, If that will doe't; your daughters are not yet Dispos'd of? Gol. No, but we have clients daily That visit their affections; and while We are speaking, here is one. Woo. Ha, which of them? I hope not Master Yongrave. Hee would engage his service to my Neece, I shall not thinke him worthy if he have Two Hares afoot. Gol. He is a stranger to me, But Master Gerard that holds conference with him, Maintaines some correspondence with my daughters: Pray let's observe. Ge. Prethee come, venter in. Yon. No farther, you have obligation, Excuse me, I have affaires, some other time Ile waite on you. Ge. What needes this ceremony? The faire ones will not blast you. Yon. 'Twere a sinne, To thinke their beames could hurt. Ge. Faith, I could wish Thy affection not ingag'd, there's so much beauty And goodnesse in this paire of sisters. Yon. Doe not Make me suspect your friendship, you would wish Me miserable, not that I dispute Their merit, but I must not yeeld to that Will bring my faith and honour into question; I have a Mistris, be you happy Sir in yours. Woo. I like this well lets interrupt e'm; Good fortune Master Yongrave. Yon. You are Sir, Most opportunely met. Gol. Kinde Master Gerard. Yon. I had a present resolution, To visit you at home, and your faire kind woman. Ge. I shall be bold. Gol. Pray enter. Woo. Wee'l together I take my leave. Go. I am your humble servant, Woo. Come Master Yongrave. Exeunt. Go. This Gerard is a Gentleman of handsome parts, And they say fortun'd, diligent in's courtship: But it concernes me to be carefull in Disposing of my children. Enter Servant. Ser. Sir Gervace Simple Sir, is newly entred, Gol. His wisdome must be welcome: there's a Knight With Lordships, but no mannors, one that has But newly cast his country skin, came up To see the fashions of the Towne, has crept Into a Knight-hood which he paid for heartily And in his best clothes is suspected for A Gentleman. Enter Sir Ger. Simple, and his man Thumpe. Sim. Thumpe, I have not yet the face to speake to her, but 'Tis no matter, and I can get her fathers and mothers good will. Thu. You have her mothers already. Sim. I, I, shee's a Matron as they lay, I came over her with My Knight-hood, and begot a consent upon her quickly: I Perceive 'tis an advantage for a man to weare spurres, The rowell of Knight-hood does gingle in the care of their Vnderstanding. Thu. I doe wonder Sir, that you speake so well now, and Want the audacity as they say to talke to your Mistresse. Sim. So do I too, but I cannot help it: I was a Gentleman Thou knowest but tother day, I have yet but a few Complements, within a while I shall get more impudence And then have at her. Thu. The father. Sim. Pray heaven you may be sav'd, Sir. Go. Y'are charitable. Sim. I am come Sir to doe my businesse. Go. How Sir? Sim. You may imagine as they say, and so forth your Daughter is a very fine Gentlewoman and may in due time be a Lady, For I doe love her by this Mullet, there's a touch of my Heraldry. Gol. Have you acquainted her, How much you meane to honour us, how farre Have you engaged her liking? Sim. Nay, I n'er spoke to her in my life, nor do not meane in hast. Gol. How Sir? Sim. Not in hast Sir, 'twere no good manners to speake hastily to a Gentlewoman, to talke post (as they say) to his Mistresse; I am resolv'd to have your consent first, and then. Gol. It argues your discretion; Sim. I think so, some wiser than some, faith how doe y'like my face. Gol. I have seene worse in a beard, Sim. Oh, ho, I tooke my choise of forty, this morning. Gol. Did you so? Sim. My man knowes I broke a Looking-glasse into forty pieces, I am sure, and this was the best face I could finde among 'Em all, look in my forehead, hast any skill in Palmistry? Gol. Not I, Sir. Sim. But this is nothing to the purpose (as they say,) Where is my beautifull Mistresse, your Daughter? Gol. Which of e'm? Sim. No matter which. Gol. They are both within. Sim. Oh, 'tis well, I will not speake with her, I told you Before, but I hope I shall have your good Will. Gol. You meane to marry her. Sim. My Chaplaine shall. Gol. You are witty; I hope Sir, you will give me leave (as They say) to deliberate, for after your example, I would Doe nothing rushly, I will not give you my consent in Hast Sir. Sim. 'Tis wisdome, I can tarry, 'tis fit I should, commend Me to the Virgin. As he goes forth he meetes Mistris Goldsworth. Mis. What, leaving us already, noble Sir? Why husband, what doe y'meane? no more respect To a man honorable? y'are not going Sir? Sim. Yes faith, I love to be going, I cannot abide to stand Still, Thumpe, take off my cloake; does my Rapier become Me? Thu. Excellent well. Sim. This 'tis to be a compleat Gentleman, what a coxcombe was I before I came to towne, the countrey breeds so many Clownes; dost thinke my tenants will know mee now I am disguised Go. But what assurance can he give me, wife, That he is able to get children? For that's a thing materiall; I would not Willingly sacrifice my daughter to An Eunuch, and such a one may that Knight be, For ought I know. Mis. What doe you talke of children? Is he not honorable, a proper Knight? Sim. She does commend mee; doe not put on my cloke yet, let her survey my person. Mis. Shall not our daughter be a Lady, and I a Ladies mother? And the Heralds know That is some priviledge; you have seene many Eunuches With a blacke beard; he is a man I warrant him, He has the right haire, Husband, for a woman, I know it by experience; tell not me, Suppose he were an Eunuch, he I say Is honorable, and any body can get children, That's the least thing of a hundred And the woman be but fruitfull. Sim. Now Ile take my leave. Mis. Wil't please you Sir, to walke in, and speake to my daughter? Sim. No, I thinke it not the best way to speake to her, as I said, In hast, what if I had an inventory of my good parts First drawne to prepare her. Gol. And his father had not left him more land than braine, His worship had beene but a poore foole. Sim. Well, if she understand signes, have at her. Mis. Come, I will direct you. Exeunt. Gol. My wife is passionate and affects this Knight For's title, but I hope my daughter will Enter Servant. Submit to my election: how now: Ser. Here is a Gentleman desires accesse to you. Gol. A Gentleman? Ser. He may be a Lord by his traine, A Page waites on him. Gol. Some fresh Inamorato. Enter Caperwit, and his Page. Cap. Save you Sir. Gol. And you Sir. Cap. You doe not know me? Gol. Not I Sir. Cap. 'Tis very likely: you have a daughter. Gol. I have two: Cap. Two? the better, there is more choise, They want husbands. Gol. 'Twill become my care to provide'm good ones. Cap. You say well, what doe y'thinke of me? Gol. I know you not. Cap. You told me that afore: may I see'm? Gol. They are not to be let out Sir by lease, Or yeerely rent. Cap. You mistake me; I come not for a lodging. Gol. Nor to lye with them? Cap. I come to take'm Sir, another way: What portions have they? Go. You should be a purse-taker, by your enquirie After their mony, they have a round portion, Sir. Cap. What's that? Go. A cipher. Cap. How? Go. Nothing, I hope you have no mind to marry. Cap. Ex nihilo nihil fit. I came to offer my selfe a Servant in affection to one of your daughters, but Nothing has converted me. Go. Doe y'heare Sir, a fine humorist: if they marry with My consent, I can make figures, which added to Their ciphers, may make up 2000.pound apiece: what Is your name? Cap. My name is Caperwit. Go. Y'ave a dancing Name, I doe not thinke, but you Write all the Coranto's. Ca. Wit! wit by Mercury! I shall loue thy daughters the Better for that: doe they affect Poetry? Go. They reade nothing else. Ca. Then they are wise; 'tis a Seraphicke contemplation; I'le furnish them with the most excellent Poems— Go. Of your owne composition? Ca. That is intimated, when I say excellent; Your daughters shall be judge, let'm vouchsafe A subject to my muse, and prove the height Of my imaginations. Go. They are entring. Enter Gerard, Chrisolina, Aurelia. Cap. Thus breakes Aurora from the Easterne hills, And chaseth night away, let me salute Your rosie cheeke— Ch. Good morrow to you Sir, there is but one Aurora, What doe y'make my Sister pray? Cap. She is the Sun it selfe. Au. No Sir, I am the daughter of that Gentleman, No sunne Ile assure you. Ca. Whose golden beames doe gild this lower world, Transfixing hearts, converting ribs of ice Into a flame. Ge. What buffonry is this? Ch. Lets heare his speech out, and my Sister be the Sunne, Wee shall have day enough: a pretty Pageant! Au. Prethee doe not minde him. Cap. Virgins, that equall all the graces, and Only in this, that you are two, beneath them. The miracles of beauty! for whose eyes The Persians might forsake their god, and pay Religious honour to this flame—whats he? Go. A Gentleman, that would endeare himselfe. Cap. Has he any fancies in him? Can he ravish The Ladies? Go. Ravish Ladies Sir? that's a dangerous matter. Ca. How many raptures does he talke a day? Is he transported with Poeticke rage? When was he stil'd Imperiall wit? who are The Prince Electors in his Monarchy? Can he like Celtick Hercules, with chaines Of his divine tongue, draw the gallant tribe Through every streete, whilst the grave senator Points at him; as he walkes in triumph, and Doth wish, with halfe his wealth, he might be young, To spend it all in Sack, to heare him talke Eternall Sonnets to his Mistris? ha? Who loves not verse is damn'd— Go. How Sir? This Gentleman dares fight. Cap. Who will fight with him? Go. You doe not know his disposition. Cap. But I will, Sir; I have a great ambition to be of your acquaintance, I hope you will excuse these fancies of mine, though I were borne a Poet I will study to be your servant in Prose, yet if now and then my braines doe sparkle, I cannot helpe it, raptures will out; my Motto is Quicquid conabor, the midwife wrapt my head up in a sheer of Sir Philip Sidney that inspired me, and my nurse descended from old Chaucer, my conversation has beene among the furies, and if I meete you in Apollo, a pottle of the best Ambrosia in the house, shall waite upon you. Enter Sir Gervase Simple, and Mistris Goldsworth. Mis. They are here Sir, at full view. Cap. What's he? Mis. A Knight Ile assure you. Cap. Does he come A wooing to the Ladies? Gol. After the Spanish fashion— A farre off. Mis. Daughter, I must counsell you to respect This honorable man, you doe not know What tis to be a Lady, and take place, Such titles come not every day, observe With what a comely garbe he walkes, and how He bends his subtle body, take him a my word, A man of his complection loves a woman naturally. Cap. A pretty motion. Mis. Pray come neerer Sir. Sim. You shall pardon me for that, I know My distance. Cap. Will he not speake to her? Gol. You should doe well to furnish him with an oration, a spoonefull of Aganippe's well, and a little of your Salt, would season, if not pickle him. Cap. Should I so wast the bright Minerva's dew, to pickle a Mushrome? Sim. Thumpe, she lookes upon me, to say truth, I am but a bashfull puppy. Thu. Your worship is more than a puppy. Sim. I, I know I am an old dog at her mother, but and I should be hang'd, I have not impudence enough to speak to her: does not that Gentleman laugh at mee? Thu. He is very merry with her father. Sim. 'Tis very suspitious, would I had a good jest to get of withall. Au. You shall command the duty of a daughter, But I hope mother, you will give me leave To love before I marry. I have yet No argument of his affection, But what you please to bring me, it becomes not My modesty to court him, and give up My heart before I heare him say, he meanes To meete and entertaine it. Mis. 'Tis a fault, and I must blame him, that he is no forwarder. Ca. I will accuse him?— Gol. Doe so. Au. Love, forgive me this excuse, my heart is fixt, I finde another written here. Ca. I doe salute you, venerable Sir. Sim. You may salute me at your pleasures, but you are mistaken, I am no more venerable than your selfe; my name is Sir Gervace Simple. Thu. And I am one of his Gentleman Vshers, Sir, that follow him. Ca. Heroick Sir, I doe adore your physnomy. Now by the dust of my Progenitors— Sim. There's a fine oath! Ca. You looke like the Nine Worthies. Sim. I have been taken for 'em a hundred times. Cap. Fairer than Plutos selfe king of the shades. Sim. That King was a poore kinsman of mine, and indeed Wee had one complexion. Ca. The Divell you had? Sim. Sir, I am sorry, I cannot stay wi'y, but pray if you meete any of the nine Worthies, or my Cosen Pluto, commend me to 'em, I shall be glad to meete you, or them, at any Taverne, betweene Cheape and Charingcrosse, and so I remaine yours, or not his owne, sau's complement. Mis. When will you please Sir Gervace, to visit us agen? Nay, it shall be yours. He complements, Sim. Now my foot's in. Exeunt. Ca. But that I see't, I should not have beleeved there were such a foole in nature. Ge. In this variety of servants, I Acknowledge you greatly honour me, and in the presence Of both your parents to vouchsafe this favour, Doubly obliges me. Ch. You are most welcome. Au. You may beleeve my sister, she n'er speakes But by direction of her heart. Ger. I am confident, Nor hath she any vertue, which you doe not Divide with her; your twins in birth and goodnesse! Au. Y'are bountifull in character. Gol. Ile not oppose you Sir, and you can winne their opinion. Cap. 'Tis enough, I shall be proud to serve you; But at this present, with your noble licence, I take my leave, there is a Lord expects To meete me at a Taverne, that has come Fourscore and nineteene mile, to heare an elegy of My composition Gol. He deserves to enjoy you. Cap. Ile attend the Ladies, when my starres will be more propitious, ith'interim wearing your beautifull figures in my heart, I kisse your white hand— Exit. Ger. I thinke the stocke of his discourse be wasted, And he returnes to take up more on's credit, Vntill he breake agen, the Towne is full Of these vaine glorious flashes. Gol. Chrisolina, You see what store of servants yee attract, Plenty of louers but I hope you will Be ruld, and take my counsell: which of all And be plaine wi'mee, hold you best opinion of? Ch. You will not Sir, be angry, if I answer you justly. Gol. No no, tell me. Ch. I confesse, I now doe feele the power of love, untill That Gentleman— Gol. Which, which Gentleman? Ch. By his faire merit, won my hearts consent, I had my freedome. Gol. Master Gerard? Ch. The same, oh Sir, there's no comparison With him and those that proffer us their service: Sir Gervace is but title, tother noise, Empty of all reality and worth, There is my choise, more pretious to my thoughts, Pointing to Ger. Than all mankind without him, and I hope You will be kind in your allowance Sir. Gol. You might have us'd lesse haste in your election, Or first acquainted me, you shall doe well To keepe possession of your heart awhile; But Ile consider; send your sister to me: What say you daughter to Sir Gervace? Au. Nothing, as much as he hath said to me. I affect worth, not shew; and in my choise I hope your judgement Sir will meete. Gol. I like this well, be obedient. Au. What thinke you Sir, of Master Gerard? Gol. You doe not love him? Au. I should then bely My heart when I deny him my best love, He needes not boast his worth, like those whom Nature And Art have left unfurnish'd, hee's a man For birth, for education, for his fortune, Worthy a nobler wife, than shee that now Commends him to you. Gol. Would you marry him? Au. I know not that man in the world beside, I would call husband, in my soule I am Already his, and if you will not be Held cruell to your daughter— Gol. How's this? Both in love with the same man? my care will be To a great purpose, this is very strange; Send your sister to me; come hither, come hither, You are not yet contracted to that Gentleman. Ch. No such thing has past. Go. But you are content to take him for your bridegroome, I meane Master Gerard. Ch. And call it happinesse; Go. Your mother calls: so, so, doe you heare? Aurelia, doe you love that Gentleman? Au. Yes. Gol. Very good, when your wedding clothes come home, pray give me leave to pay for 'em, and the dinner too. I say nothing of a portion, goe after your sister: hum, this is very pretty, faith, let me be bold to aske you a question Sir. Ger. My answer shall be just, and free. Gol. Which of my daughters doe you love best? As y'are a Gentleman the truth, if you affect either, it Is quickly answered. Ge. The truth is, as you aske, I love neither. Gol. How, doe you love none of 'em both, they are very well rewarded. Ge. Love neither of them best, they are so equall in beauty, and desert, by both I sweare, I cannot preferre any. Gol. You'd not have two wives against the Statute? Ge. When I have the happinesse to speak with one alone, Theres so much sweetnesse in her, such a troope Of graces waiting on her words and actions, I love her infinitely, and thinke it blessing To see her smile, but when the tother comes In presence, in her eie she brings a charme To make me dote on her; I am divided, And like the trembling Needle of a Dyall, My heart's afraid to fixe, in such a plenty I have no starre to sayle by. Gol. This is stranger. Than all the rest, but doe you love e'm both? Ger. I dare not call it my misfortune Sir, And yet I know not.— Gol. What will become o'this? I'st possible? My daughter will be mad if this humor Hold, and I am little better while I thinke on't. Ile to e'm agen. Exit. Ger. On whom shall I complaine for my hard fate? Love is not innocent enough to bee A child, yet Poets give him Deity, Fond men! prove it in me, thou quiverd Boy, That love with equall flame two Mistresses, I will beleeve thee a god, and kisse thy dart, Furnish my bosome with another heart.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Sir Iohn Woodhamore, Master Yongrave. Woodhamore. I am her Keeper; expect here a while, And Ile prepare her. Exit. Yon. Ile attend; poore Gentlewoman, Borne with more freedome than thou livest, thy parents Left thee not rich to be a prisoner, Nay worse, a prey to this hard man, who hath Sold thee already, for if I obtaine Thy love—I heare e'm comming. Enter Eugenia. Woodham. Wood. Gentle Neece, Misconster not my actions, 'tis my care Of thee, and to satisfie the duty I owe to my dead Brother, thy kinde parent: I thus restraine thee, thou art young, and canst not, Being so good thy selfe, suspect the world Hath any false men in't; I know there are Gallants, that study to undoe such Virgins As thou art, that will flatter and betray Thy fortunes to their riot, this unhappinesse I would prevent, and have new found a man, Into whose armes I may deliver up The wealth that I am trusted with. Eug. Hee's welcome: Pray what's your businesse? Yon. You may understand, partly by what your Vncle hath delivered. Eug. You come a wooing doe ye not? Heigho! Yon. How's this? Woo. I'le leave you at opportunity. Exit. Eug. Troth, if you be a good man, bee not tedious, I doe not love set speeches not long praises, I hope y'ave made no verses o'my haire, Acrosticks o'my name, I hate them worse Than witchcraft, or the place I live in: if You be a sutor, put me out of my paine, Quickly I beseech you. Yon. I am one would be your servant. Eug. My servant? what can you doe? Yon. I can love you. Eug. I cannot helpe it, 'tis none of my fault. Yon. Your beauty makes me, Which cannot bee without as faire a soule. I dare beleeve my eyes, which till this present, Could never reach more than your face, and that At too unkind a distance, from your window; I have enquired your fortune, and lamenting With loving pitty, such a noble creature Should be confind to narrow limits, come To bring you freedome, make you mistresse of Your liberty, and my selfe, if you can thinke Me worthy of your love; I doe not court Your fortune, but your selfe, and if I urge With too much haste, what great ones might be proud To expect, after much sute, and that you cannot Finde in your tongue consent, encourage me, But for the present with one smile. Eug. I cannot, Vnlesse I counterfeit, I have not smil'd These ten moneths; if a sigh will pleasure you, I can afford enough to breake your heart, And yet I live. Walke into the other roome, You'l find an alteration in the ayre, And thinke you come into a mist, which I Made all with my owne sighes, but I would not Infect you so; you seeme an honest Gentleman. Yon. Her sorrowes helpe the growth of my affection; What will she be in peace, that is so lovely In her distresse; I wish you would impose Something on me, to settle your sad thoughts, I would imbrace a danger, to assure The quiet of your minde. Eug. 'Tis in the power Of one, that would be kinde to helpe me, but— Yon. Make me that friend. Eug. You may love me too much, To undertake that taske. Yon. Too much I cannot. Eug.

To mocke my honest heart with this cheape service. I was in earnest, when I promisd more, Than carriage of a letter. Eug. If you please To make it then a perfect act of Noblenesse, You may take notice, that I long have loved him, And if you finde him cold, in the perusall: Tell him I had the promise of his faith, When I gave up my heart, i'th presence of A thousand Angels, that will witnesse it: If yet hee bee not soft to stirre up his Compassion, tell him how I live, and languish, You may report you saw mee weepe, I have not Much more to say, if you will doe this favour, Twill be an argument of your respect, I see your resolution cooles already. Yon. Tis a severe imployment, but Ile doe Something, pray honour mee to kisse your hand, I have not yet deserv'd to reach your lippe: Content dwell in your bosome. Enter Woodhamore. Wood. What successe? Yon. I hope well, some affaires Call mee away. Exit. Wood. Good Master Yongrave: how doe you like this Gentleman. Eug. I shall desire to see him agen, my heart Is light upon sudden, please you Vncle Ile in, and play a lesson o'my Lute. Exit. Wood. Doe what you please, I rellish not your ayre, Thats onely sweet to mee that profit brings, There is no musicke without golden strings. Enter Chrisolina, Aurelia. Ch. Was ever Maid so miserable in her affection? Au. Is not my fate as cruell? Cannot wee love him still, and yet bee sisters? I hope we may; the love I beare to him Shall not destroy my piety to you: Nature hath fram'd us two in person, but wee are both one in heart. Ch. Indeed we are; Wee are too much one, And both love one too much, for either to enjoy him. Au. Say not so, give me a little time and I will try How I can give him you; I will perswade My heart to let him goe. Ch. Alas poore sister, Why should you give him me? it is no argument; Because I came one minute into life Before you, therefore you should render first To me, what is so pretious to your selfe; Rather let me begin, that was first made Acquainted to the world, resigne to thee, And make thee happy by enjoying him. Au. But doe you know the miserable consequence? For if you love him with that truth, and fervour You speake of, (as it were a sinne in me Not to beleeve it,) can you looke for lesse Than death, to see mee mistresse of his faith, And lead in nuptiall triumph to the Church? Ch. I cannot tell— Au. Or if it did not kill you So soone, I know the sorrow would distract you, How can I smile to see my sister weepe, Away her eyes, and tell the jarring minutes With hasty sighes to know her selfe forsaken? Ch. And can it be, you could doe lesse, that love him As well as I, to see him made my husband, Would it not make you melancholy sister, And ofte retire into the darke to weepe, Could you behold us freely kisse, embrace And goe to bed together, remembring that You gave this friend to me from your owne Heart, and live? Au. Why let me dye then, Rather than you, I shall perhaps obtaine Some charitable Epitaph, to tell The world, I died to save my sisters life; Tis no such thing to dye. Ch. This is agen Our misery, it is not in our power Be resignation, to assure to either His love, he only must determine it. Wee cannot guide his passion. Au. Nor himselfe Direct it, as he now appeares divided, May be, it would be fortunate for both, Would he be more particular. Ch. That makes Our flame increase, that he protests he loves Vs both, so equally. Au. 'Tis very strange. Ch. Let us then joyne our argument to perswade him, To point out one of us to be his Bride, Tother in time, may hope to gaine her freedome; I know not what I say—we both must plead Enter Gerard. Against our selves: see, he is come already. Ge. The scales are even still, that one had lesse Perfection, to make the doubtfull ballance Give difference in their value; but I wrong Their vertues to wish either any want, That equally incline my soule to love 'em. Iustice I now consent, thou shouldst be blinde, My eyes are but the cause I cannot see, And will not give my judgement leave to make Distinction of these two Democritus, I doe allow thy rashnesse, ad confesse Then thou didst rectifie thy contemplation When thou didst lose thy sight. Which of these two Instruct me love, that tother? both? what fate Hovers about my choice? Were it not sinne I would be blind, as Poets fancie love, Into whom now I am transform'd, that then My soule not looking through these glasses, might With inward speculation ayme at her, That is the happiest, if one can be so. Ch. Sir, if wee be not troublesome—. Ge. You cannot. Au. To interrupt your meditations, wee have a sute. Ge. Both? it must needes be granted, Ch. Nor let us suffer in our modesties, If our request seeme strange. Ge. Tis a command, And I must needes obey; you two divide this Empire: Ch. You prepare; we dispute not The strangenesse of your love, but pitty it, And are so ready in our owne affection To answer your opinion of us both, That if you can collect, what devide On two, and place it fairely upon one, Choose whom you will make happie. Au. We expect not Your hasty answer, though wee both desire A swift end to your trouble. Ge. I pray stay, Exit. I would determine now, but cannot—faire ones, Was ever lover so perplext? I must resolve. Enter Master Thornay. Tho. Why how now Franke? what melancholy? Ger. How came you hither? Tho. Why o'my feet: I was at your lodging to enquire for you, And here they told me I should finde you. Ge. Yes, Here I am lost indeed; prethee excuse my dulnesse. Tho. What's the matter, come I ghesse The cause, which of these Gentlewomen is't? I saw 'em. Ge. Didst? and how dost like 'em prethee? Tho. I doe like 'em so well, that I could wish— Ge. Which, which of them? Tho. Faith I cannot tell, the worst of 'em both a-bed wi'me. Ge. Thy wishes are Not modest: couldst thou love one of them nobly? Ha? thou hast a person and fortune to invite thy Entertainement, come let me counsell you. Tho. To what? Ge. To love, and to a blessing couldst thou see So sweet a paire, and feele no burning shaft? Hast thou a soule about thee, that is capable Of knowledge and delight? didst ever love? Tho. Yes once, and I thinke heartily, for the time, But I ha' drowned her. Ge. How? Tho. In Sacke, I thinke as gallants lose their Mistresses, By drinking their health too often. Ge. Prethee doe not trifle. Tho. What wouldst have me answer? I can love. Ge. A woman? Tho. What dost make of mee? Ge. With honour? Tho. And honesty, if I see cause. Ge. Enough; thou shalt have cause Within two minutes, shalt but see agen These sisters, and be proud to be a servant, I prophesie already; oh my friend! Tho. Pray take me wi'you. Ge. Yes, thou shalt goe with me And speake to 'em, and be amaz'd as I am, To know there are such creatures. Tho. I ha'seene a multitude of faire ones. Ge. All other women Are but like pictures in a gallery, Set off to th'eye, and have no excellency But in their distance; but these two, farre off Shall tempt thee to just wonder, and drawne neere Can satisfie thy narrowest curiosity: The stocke of woman hath not two more left, To rivall them in graces. Tho. You speake for 'em, I may goe farther, and fare worse,—. Ile not Consider more on't, lets to 'em, stay— Which of these two's your mistresse? let me know Where to direct my service. Ge. That question Hath puzled mee already. Tho. Say, which is't you best affect? Ge. I love em both, so equally, I know not which to name. Tho. How, both? what thou Should I doe with em? art thou mad? Ge. A little, Containe thy selfe, and call thy reason to thee, Although it be the cruelty of my fate, I can be no barre to thee; I can enjoy But one, and yet thou shalt have choice Of both, thou art not thus my rivall, But my friend, reliefe of my distraction, for shee Whom thou refusest, if thou canst endeare thy selfe to either, In my heart shall meet a cleere and perfect entertainment. Tho. Hum. Ger. Canst thou resolve? winne either, And we both grow happy at once. Tho. You say well, this is faire— Ger. They are here. Enter Simple and M. Golds. at one doore, and Thump, Chris. and Aurel. at the other. Mis. With your favour I must chide yon Sir, not once speak to My daughter, she expects to be courted with kisses and imbraces. Sim. I, I, I could kisse her all over, and imbrace her too, but I have an imperfediment, I cannot speake as I would doe; but let mee alone a little, Ile try, let me see, and I hanot forgot my verses. Mis. Here they are, Ile not trouble you. Exit. Ger. I will leave this Gentleman; Hee is my best friend Ladies. Ch. You oblige us more to respect him. Ger. I hope you will be just, At my returne, when I declare my selfe. Au. Sir, you sh'anot need to urge it. Ger. I am your honourer. Exit. Sim. Now Thump, I am resolv'd to speak to her, whatsoever Come on't; hum, hum. Enter Mr. Goldsworth. Gol. What another sutor? I were best locke up my daughters, they'l be smothered with Gentlemen: Sir Gervace you are a welcome man. Sim. You shall see, if I doe not speake to her, now Now, and to the purpose, in spight of the divell. Thump Stroke me o'th back. He plucks Aur. by the gowne. There's something in my head, and t'were out. Thu. I hope you doe not meane your braines. Sim. Would somebody lov'd me, but as well, as I loved Somebody. Au. Now 'tis out. Sim. La you there, I thinke I talked to her. Gol. But in my opinion you were quickly daunted. Sim. Was I so? well marke me now, now, I will wincke As hard as I can, and then I'me sure she cannot put me out. Enter Caperwit. Sim. takes Cap. by the hand. Sim. Beauty— Cap. How now? what meanes this? Sim. Let me but kisse thy hand, and tell How much I love thee; I know very well Thou art a Phenix, beautious and bright, And dost burne every man for thy delight Thy eyes are Sunne and Moone, not to be match'd. Ch. This was intended for you sister. Sim. Thy haire is fine as gold, thy chin is hatch'd With silver, needs must brazen be my face, That cannot come into thee with a grace. Cap. Before or after meat. Sim. Sweet, heare me out. But this I know, I am thy faithfull Lover, Oh quench my fire. Cap. Or else the pot run's over. Sim. Y'are in the right: Accept me for thy servant, not thy foe, For I doe love thee better than any man in the whole world can doe. Cap. Come kisse me then, and open thy faire eyne. Sim. With all my heart. Om. Ha, ha. Sim. Gentlemen, rest you merry; Thump, By this hand Ile bee drunke presently. Thu. And you had taken my counsell, you had done so Before you came hither: Wine is armour of proofe. Exeunt. Cap. Ladies I am sorry, this rude fellow has Abus'd your eare, with harsh, and untun'd numbers. Gol. Your verses have a tune belike Cap. I came a purpose, to present a copie Of verses that should make your genius stand O'th tip-toe, list to me, and grow immortall. Ch. We shall be troubled now. Tho. If please you Lady Weel walke a side, I have something of more weight I would impart. Ex. Au. Ile leave him too. Exit. Gol. Master Caperwit, before you read, pray tell me, Have your verses any adjectives? Cap. Adjectives, would you have a Poem without Adjectives? they are the flowers, the grace of al our language: A well chosen Epithete doth give new soule To fainting Poesie, and makes every verse A bride, with Adjectives we baite our lines, When we doe fish for Gentlewomens loves, And with their sweetnesse catch the nibling eare Of amorous Ladies, with the musicke of These ravishing Nownes, we charme the silken Tribe, And make the Gallant melt with apprehension Of the rare word: I will maintain't against A bundle of Grammarians, in Poetry, The Substantive it selfe, cannot subsist Without an Adjective. Gol. But for all that, Those words would sound more full, me thinks, that are not. So larded; and if I might counsell you, You should compose a Sonnet cleane without e'm: A row of stately Substantives, would march Like Switzers, and beare all the field before e'm; Carry their weight, shew faire like Deeds enrold, Not Writs, that are first made, and after fild. Thence first came up the title of blancke verse, You know Sir, what blancke signifies? when the sense First framed, is tyed with Adjectives like points, And could not hold together without wedges: Hang't tis pedanticke, vulgar Poetry, Let children when they versifie, sticke here, And there these pidling words for want of matter: Poets write Masculine numbers. Cap. You have given me a pretty hint, tis new. Gol. And will bee gratefull, My daughter will affect it much the better, And twill be honour, if shee be the first, To whom so choice a Poem is presented. I wish you well Sir. Exit. Cap. You oblige my service, I will bestow these verses o'my footman; They'l serve a Chambermaid, let me see I want a little quickning, two or three Infusions of sacke will heighten mee, And make my Genius dance, then Lady, Lady—Gone? Shee's hard of Soule, but I must supple her, And there's a conceit new strucke upon my braine Will doo't, ????? forces united conquer, Lady grow soft, if merit cannot prove Happy, wee must use policie in love. Exit. Enter Chrisalina and Thornay. Ch. No more; you doe not well to wrong your friend, That trusts you with his bosome. Tho. Faire one, heare mee. Ch. He gave you welcome hither, and you practise Vnworthily to supplant him. Tho. You are too Severe, I have no thought so wicked Lady, Deny me not that liberty, which all The Creatures have, to wish their owne felicity; Which cannot bee without you, hee will not Repine to see mee happy in your love. Ch. In seeming to extenuate your error, You thus enlarge it, and bring into question The honour of your friend, for whom I must Though weake, rise up a Champion for his vertue, And to beate off all argument, on your part To move for my affection, know, he is next heaven, The onely object of my heart, nor can it know a change. Tho. And yet if you collect your selfe, you are not The onely Mistresse of his heart, your sister hee loves As well as you; your pardon fairest, tis possible, Hee may preferre her too, since neither piety nor law allowes, Hee can bee husband at one time, to both. Then let discretion guide you first to freedome, I love you not with halfe a heart, but all; Heaven knowes with all, at every looke you doe Transfixe me, and can onely cure the wound With the same eyes, if they but smile upon it. Ch. I must not heare you plead thus, you appeare Nor friend to him, nor me; so fare you well. Exit. Thor. I am caught, by this good day I am, and know not How now to helpe my selfe: a hansome thing! What a blind buzzard is this Iackanapes Cupid? Pox of his bird-bolt, Ile not leave her: Yet I may be too forward; I am punish'd: Uenus, thy pardon, I beseech thee, If thou beest not hard-hearted, as the Poets feine, Speake to thy Boy to fetch his Arrow backe, Or strike her with a sharpe one, make her squeake, And Ile allow thee a Goddesse. Ha, 'tis he. Enter Gerard. Ger. Before thou speak'st to me, let me peruse Thy face, Ile tell my selfe how thou hast sped: Well? is't not so? Yet doe not answer me, That smile does not shew cleere, there is some cloud Ith'corner of thy forehead, that would spread, And darken all thy face. Thor. Your Physiognomy is quite discredited. Ger. Hast prevail'd? With which? why now thou art to tedious. Thor. With the eldest, Chrysolina. Ger. Ha, what sound was that? With Chrysolina? I prethee what of her; I love her deerely; Thou hast not filcht away her heart, it grew with mine. Thor. How's this? Ger. Hast thou not seene the Woodbine, That honey-dropping tree, and the lov'd Bryer, Embrace with their chaste boughs, twisting themselves, And weaving a greene net to catch the birds, Till it doe seeme one body, while the flowers Wantonly runne to meet and kisse each other? So 'twas betwixt us two. Thor. I meane the yongest. Ger. What my Aurelia? Thou canst not rob me so: the amorous Turtles Have but their imitation from our love; The Pelican loves not her yong so well, That digs upon her brest an hundred springs, When in her blood she bathes the innocent birds, As I doe my Aurelia. Thor. Godbewi'y',—I know not how to please you, nor to answer. Ger. I prethee stay. Thor. Engage me in a businesse? Nay, thrust me oth'lime-twigs, to set you At liberty, when your owne wings were glu'd Toth'bush, and d'ye reward me a this fashion? And I had knowne it, you shou'd ha'fluttered. Ger. I forgot my selfe, I prethee pardon me, I will excuse thee when thou art in love. Thor. Then doe so now, and you'l be temperate and heare me. Ger. Speake, I am recollected. Thor. And I am in love. Ger. Thou didst name both, thou art so unhappy. Thor. Your humors lead me to't, but I shall tell you? Ger. Which, which of them did most encourage thee? Thor. Be not you passionate still, but give me thanks, And call me fortunate, she has halfe consented. Ger. I shall be lost ith'darke: declare which. Thor. Which? why the eldest; which? Chrysolina. Now be you advised, and court the other. Ger. Halfe consenting. Thor. I may say three quarters, and not lye. Ger. Tis false; and such a staine thou throwest upon that Virgin, Thy blood deserves to purge. Thor. You doe not meane to play the foole thus: Pox upon this madnesse: I wo'not fight with you, And I will love that Gentlewoman: I thought I had done you a courtesie. Ger. So thou hast, if it be true. Thor. Have you a mind to be the everlasting madcap? And you can couple with both, I can resigne; Poore Gentlewoman, she'l ha' the worst on't. Ger. But I prethee tell me, With what Art didst thou so soone win her to thee? It was some moneths 'ere I prevail'd; and were I not Confident of thy honesty, I should Suspect some witchcraft. Thor. There is an Art In wooing, not reveal'd to every man, Which he that knowes, shall doe more with a Maid In some minute, than others in a twelve-moneth. Ger. 'Tmust be a luckie minute. Thor. I, he must take her ith'nicke; and court her In the precise minute: yet it may be, she In pitty of my sufferings or mistrusting She might not be the first in your election, Inclin'd the sooner: Now would I have you, Without more ceremony, neglect the wench That I have chosed: D'ye marke? neglect her, And addresse all your courtship to the yongest, Your meaning will be cleerely understood A both sides; so you shall with ease, enlarge Your owne heart, fixe on one whose armes already Are open to yee, and make my path direct, Without any rub to the other. Is this sense? Obey it then; set on afore with your Mistris A hand gallop, if I overtake you not, let me swing I'th bridle, and set a saddle o'my backe, and let all the Fooles in the Towne ride me. Ger. Wee must not bee too rash, lets walke, and thinke on't. Exeunt. Sic explicit Actus secundus.</field>

An honourable Lady, I confesse, and hath a fortune Noble like her birth, tis the rich Aldermans widdow, The great Bird that dyed at's Country house, a Kinsman To the Ravens of the City; by no meanes admit her, Shee'le betray her foolish Passion. Gol. What is the matter? Cap. Some few dayes agoe I did by chance, but drop a complement, How much I was her servant, and she tooke it To'th heart, and ever since hath sought occasion To expresse her love to mee, poore Gentlewoman.

Cap. Sheele tire all patience: But Lady, be assur'd my heart is dedicate To you, and were all womenkind in ballance With your divinest person, their light scale Would kicke the Firmament, or comming downe, Bee lost i'th middle Region of the ayre, Or bee converted to a Cloud to weepe Vpon the earth, for being so much exceld.

Tis in your way to aske if my Cosin Bulfinch, The Steward of my Land, bee come to Towne, Hee lies in Fleetstreet betweene Hawke and Buzzard. I'th afternoone, remember Sirrah, that You goe to Master Kite, that lives i'th Poultry, And say I shall expect the thousand pound, Was lent him upon morgage: Sir, beseech your Noblenesse excuse mee, The affaires so neerely doe concerne mee, with A Gentleman, (now your guest,) that I presumed It should not bee offence, if I tooke hold Of this occasion, to speake with him. Gol. Madame, you need plead no excuse for that, Command your freedome here: Daughters, my Lady Would have some private conference. Bir. By no meanes Let me appeare so troublesome, your presence Will be no hurt to my desigue, you shall Command a great deale more. Cap. 'Twas cunningly prepared. Bi. Sir, after all, let me obtaine your priviledge. Ca. Proceed.— Bi. I shall accuse my selfe of too much boldnesse, If you neglect mee Sir before all these; I come not to disturbe you, nor to publish What you have taken from mee. Go. I hope shee will lay some felony to his charge. Bi. But Sir, you might have been so kind, to have seene your friend once in three dayes. Ca. I must be pardon'd Widow, The glasse that tells the hower, hath not more sands, Than there be Ladies waite to catch me up To spend my time with 'em, they breake my dreames, With importunity, and allow me but One minute in a weeke, to say my prayers. Bi. Among them all, there is not one That more desires your happinesse. Ca. Tis more your goodnesse Lady, than desert, Or provocation in me. Bi. Y'are modest, And thus increase your value. Ca. Your favours are acknowledg'd, and take up Much of my studies, how I may be active In service to reward 'em, still preserving My liberty, I must not be confind Or wedg'd in; all that's good in nature ought To be communicable, if you have Promis'd your selfe more of me, than as you are Allowd, an excellent part o'th commonwealth, Tis justice you correct the imagination, Perhaps you'l say, you love me. Go. A fine Dialogue: Bi. My blushes speake me guilty, and I feare Betray my frailty to these Gentlewomen: You'l sinne against your knowledge Sir, to make A question how much I esteeme you, be not A tyrant, if my opinion of your worth Prevaile against my modesty, to say I cannot choose but love you, tis my fate, My breeding never suffred, but in this, That I should lose my selfe to court a man, Ambitious of my favour; 'tis in vaine To tell you, with what art, my eyes have beene Courted by great ones for their smile, for you Will turne them all to teares. Chr. Alas poore Lady. I pitty her, what doth she see in him, To draw this passion? Cap. May be, I am engag'd To another beauty. Bir. That's my feare indeed; For who can looke with eyes like mine upon you, And not be tempted to the same desires? But be not Sir deceived, all forheads are not True glasses of the minde, and beauty alone Deserves not such a blessing, young men doe Too hastily betray themselves to miserie, That thinke no heaven but in their Mistresse face, Looke on my fortune, which doth spread more riches, Than pleasure can instruct thee wayes to spend, Delights shall streame themselves into thy bosome, Honour and titles of the state shall woe Thy name to put them on and not be thine But thou their ornament. Cap. Affection must Flow uncompeld, you may be pleas'd to take Some other time, to finish this discourse. Bir. I may suspect I have offended these; But pray interpret fairely, noble Sir, to Simple. I doe beseech you pardon The errors that you finde in us fraile women, Yet I beleeve you would not use me so Neglectfully: tis time, I take my leave. Gol. Wee are your humble servants. Sim. Sir, if you will not affect this Ladie, I hope some other may. Ca. And write himselfe the happiest man alive; She is Widow for a Lord; but I am fixt, I would you had her Sir, I say no more; She has an estate of twenty Exchequers, and Is of so gentle soule. Bir. I leave you to repent Your cruelty, my Coach— Sim. Please you Madam, Doe me the grace to let me waite upon you. Cap. Now do I expect shee'l dote upon me: Ex. Gol. Bird, Simple. Ladies, you see what fortunes I neglect, She is a pretty handsome creature too. Aur. In my opinion Sir, you have not beene So kind as shee deserves, and for my part I have so much compassion of her sufferings, Were all the wit of younger brothers in you, And could you make me joynture of a Province, I would rather marry my fathers serving man And stand at livery my selfe than be Wife to a man so ingratefull. Ex. Au. Cap. How, sweet Lady? Chr. My sister, Sir, is just, can you expect An entertainement here after your scorne Of one that nobly loves you? Ex. Chr. Cap. I have usd a pretious policie to supplant my selfe, She has a scruple in her conscience, And will not wrong the Lady Bird, a pox Vpon his Rhetoricke. Enter Goldsworth. Gol. Your Lady Bird is Coach'd, and she hath tooke Sir Gervace with her. Ca. How? Gol. Their legs doe justle In the same boote. Cap. Ha, ha, ha. Gol. Why doe you laugh? What humor's this? Cap. Sir Gervace: Ha, ha, he thinkes, ha, ha— Gol. You have a merry spleene, I know not what He thinkes, but if he meane to retrive the Lady Bird. Cap. Ha, ha. Gol. Pray let me know, whence springs this suddaine mirth; I will laugh wi'yee. Cap. Hold my sides, my buttons! Gol. Tis well your doublet's slash'd Cap. Ha, ha, next time I come, Ile discover—I sha'not Containe my selfe i'th'streete, ha, ha. Gol. The Poet's mad indeed, farewell Democritus. Ex. Enter Thornay, Yongrave. Yon. By your favour Sir. Tho.

Although I am confident You thinke it not my office to convey Letters so much respect I beare the Gentlewoman That sent it, I would thinke it Sir no burden To carry an answer to her. Tho. It requires none. Yon. Shall I returne, you'l visit her in person? Tho. I cannot promise. Yon. Why? Tho. I may forget it. Yon. With your pardon Sir, she did impose on me. To know some resolution. Tho. She did? Are you acquainted with her? Yon. I doe beare No great age in her knowledge. Tho. Perhaps she has imparted the contents. Yon. I could conjecture By circumstance shee much desires to see you. Tho. Cannot come; that's all— Yon. I must have more. Tho. How Sir? Yon. Tis a neglect becomes you not. Tho. You are not sent a Champion to defie me. Yon. I have no title from her blood, and yet Her vertue is so neere me, I must tell you, She hath deserv'd your best esteeme. Tho. She has told you belike some story. Yon. I pray see her, Ile waite upon you. Tho. To what purpose? Yon. To love and cherish her, that claimes your heart, The office of your soule to honour her, Does not your conscience tremble yet? what reason Can you alledge you should not love her? Tho. Reason? Ile shew you a reason, walk a little further. Yon. I shall expect it. Ex. Enter Gerard. Ger. It must be so, and yet methinkes I move Without a soule, she is the first apostate From loves religion, in that my honour Is safe, and it is justice, my Aurelia, This heart to thee, should now alone be sacred. Enter Chrysolina. Ch. Sir, you are welcome, what not speake to me? This is a strange neglect; I have newes for you: Your friend— Ger. Tis so, he has prevaild with her, And she will boast her change. Chr. He cannot be So fixt in meditation; with your favour. Ger. Reserve your newes, I doe not thirst to heare it. Chr. Sure he mistakes me all this while, tis I. Ge. But tis not I, I see you are a woman, I have nothing else to say. Exit. Ch. I have not us'd him so: was there no way to expresse his purpose, without this scorne? tis not discreetly done, I could be very angry he returnes, Enter Gerard, Aurelia. With him Aurelia. Aur. I am ignorant With what words I should meet this noble love. Ger. I was created for this happinesse, To these embraces which doe more than twist Our bodies, every circle of thy armes Enchaines my soule, that doth forget all freedome, And willingly submit to be thy prisoner. Chr. It doe not grieve me that he loves my sister, Ge. I am too little to containe my joy, It slowes above the narrow banks Aurelia: What shall I say let me bath here eternally, And study new Arithmetick, to count Our blessings. Au. Can you Sir be constant? Chr. I, touch him there Aurelia. Ger. You doe ill To interrupt our joyes upon this lip That deserves all should open to commend it, I seale the contract of my heart for ever, I wil be nothing when I am not thine: Suspect the starres may lose themselves in heaven, But never I this vow, thy sister has No part in my affection; she usurp'd Some title, but I now have canceld all The thoughts of her, and offer thee my selfe, My selfe thy perfect honourer. Ex. Ger. Aur. Chr. Wherein have I deserv'd to be thus slighted? Is there no conflict in my blood? Can love I beare a sister, take away all sense Of this indignity? Enter Thornay and Yongrave. Tho. Looke you Sir, I promis'd you a reason, why I could Not love Eugenia; there's my reason, I Doe love that Gentlewoman. Chr. Tis Master Thornay: I am resolv'd, I have no other way To punish his disdaine, than to pretend I love this Gentleman, that he may see I have the freedome of my soule, to mocke His triumph, and with as much facility Meet his neglect. Oh Master Thornay, You are very welcome, I was wishing for you. Thor. Hum? this entertainment is a little better Than I expected. Chr. You absent your selfe too much beleeve, your visits shall not be more frequent, than your person gratefull hither. Thor. doe y'heare, you may returne, and tell this story Vnto the Lady i'th inchanted Castle: You see my fate, I cannot come; Godbe-wi'y'. Yon. You shall acquit your selfe more Nobly Sir, And better satisfie her in your person. Thor. I wo'not take the paines to see her, and Shee were a dying. Yon. How? Thor. Not to recover her. Chr. Shall you and I Sir, walke a turne i'th Garden. Thor. Yes Lady, Heaven vouchsafe I grow not mad Wi'my good fortune. Yon. With your pardon Mistresse, I must take priviledge to tell this man Hee is not worthy of your favours. Thor. How Sir? You doe not know my temper: Yon. Nor regard it. draw. Chr. Hold as you beare respect to mee. Thor. I am charm'd. Yon. I should be guilty of some sinne to you Not to reveale, this Gentleman has made A forfeit of his honor. Thor. Will you heare him? Pox o'my dulnesse, what meant I to bring Him hither? doe not credit any thing, Wee are old enemies, and he has studied this Device to poison your opinion of me, A meere trick; doe not beleeve a word sweet Lady. Ch. I am not easie Sir to entertaine Malicious accusation of your fame, Your vertue in my thoughts, is not so soone Shaken with one report. Thor. That's comfort yet. Yon. Then you provoke me to be plaine, know Lady, Y'are i'th way to be most miserable, Abus'd by this false man, that will betray Your innocent beauty to so great a shame, Repentance is not able to restore you; He has a wife already. Ch. How a wife? Yon. A wife, if holy vowes have power to bind you; Tho. Doe you beleeve this? were you by When I was married. Yon. No, but heaven and Angels Are witnesses you did exchange a faith With one that mournes a Virgin, and a Widdow: Have you no earthquake in you? does thy soule It selfe not feele an ague, to remember How many kisses seald the amorous contract? Shee meant it so, and every day her eyes Weepe in the memory of her selfe forsaken: And cause her griefe will not at once destroy her, Despairing of your love, to shew how willing Shee is to dye, doth every houre distill Part of her soule in teares. Chr. This cannot bee. Thor. Be: no, no, 'tis impossible: shall we walk sweet Lady? Yon. Will not this excite your pitty, mercy shines bright in women. Chr. I have heard you Sir, And doubt not, when hee comes to answer These imputations, hee may quit himselfe. Thor. Would wee were both on's but to skirmish in A saw-pit, I must cut his throat. Chr. Admit he promis'd love, Oblig'd himselfe by oath to her you plead for, This binds him not to undoe himselfe for ever. Yon. Vndoe himselfe. Chr. Yes, marriage is an act, That doth concerne his whole life, and in something May marre, or profit his eternity: Perhaps the Gentlewoman, since hee gave His faith is falne from vertue. Thor. I have heard so. Chr. May be turn'd prostitute. Thor. I, who'l sweare for her? Yon. I must not heare her nam'd with the suspition Of such a staine. Chr. Wee doe not Sir accuse her. Thor. Not absolutely. Yon. Did you but know the Creature, it would call A blush into your face, for talking thus; Shee has purity enough for all her sex, And this attended with so many vertues, As but to wish her more, it selfe were sinne. Chr. This Gentleman pleades for her. Thor. Will you please to walke? Chr. Dismisse him first. Thor. Doe y'heare; this Lady Is weary of your company; you have Not us'd me like a Gentleman, indeed Scurvily, tis no time nor place to expostulate, But wee shall meet agen; in the meane time, Returne, and tell the Virgin you so magnifie, I doe not finde my selfe in any humour To see her agen; pray her neglect no fortune, For my sake, there be many yonger brothers I'th Towne, will bee content to marry her: You may resolve her what's become of me, There is no wrastling with our fate. Yon. Thou art not worth my answer. Exit Yon. Chr. Ile not question Sir, this Gentlemans relation. Tho. You are wise. Chr. But in my confidence, hee hath spoke all truth: I must desire you visit mee no more. Thor. You doe but jest I hope. Chr. Ingratefull man! how are poore women coozen'd? With what impudence couldst thou desire my favour? Goe and make a satisfaction to the injur'd Maid, Borne the dishonour of a man. Exit. Thor. Am I awake? Or doe I dreame, I am made a Coxcombe thus? I am a Raskall, and deserve no mercy, For abusing that poore Gentlewoman, that sent So kindly to me; wo'd the Messenger were here agen. Enter Gerard and Aurelia. Tis Master Gerard, how hath hee sped? Ger. You are sad Aurelia; what on the sudden Can beget this change? Are you in health? Aur. Yes Sir. Ger. Your blood me thinkes Is wandring from your cheeke, your eyes have lost Their lightning too, call backe your smiles, and blesse Him that is now your creature. Aur. Mine? excuse me if I suspect. Ger. Ha. Aur. I have heard you Sir. And have considered all that you have said To make me thinke you are now wholly mine: I must confesse you have exprest a Lover, Wanted no Art to flourish your warme passion: But language is no clew to guide us to The knowledge of your heart. Ge. Nor is suspition a cause enough in justice to condemn. Aur. It is not; but where circumstances meet, They may be thought on. Ger. By your beauty, By those faire eyes, that never kil'd till now, Make me so happy, but to know what cause Inclines you to suspect, and I will take it The greatest argument of love, that ever A Virgin shew'd to man; then Ile be bold, And with the whitenesse of my soule make such Assurance of you, that not malice, aided With all the devils cunning, shall be able To interpose one scruple more against me. Aur. You lov'd my Sister. Ger. I did once, my Aurelia. Aur. And you declare you can neglect her now, Looke on her like a stranger. Ger. 'Tis most true. Aur. She lov'd you well, most nobly, with as much Fervour as ever I did or can love; Should I thinke to be more secure than she? Promise that firme to me, which in so fresh A sight and memory you have violated To her, that plac'd you in as deare a bosome? Discretion bids me pause, I may be rash, Either you lov'd her not at all, and so You may play false with both, or loving her With as much levity, I suppose you may Forsake me too. Therfore I bid you first farewell. Exit. Ge. I am blasted. Thor. We are both undone, I dare not see him. Exit. Ger. Was ever man so miserably lost? Is there a balme can cure me? Oh, I bleed: The sword wounds gently but love kils indeed. Exit. Sic explicit Actus Tertius.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Enter Eugenia and her Maid. Eug. Has truth forsooke mankind? or is it my Fate onely to converse with those that are So cruell and neglectfull of our sexe? Vnhappy Maid! is he not yet return'd? Maid. None yet appeares. Eug. Then I despaire to see him: And when I thinke indeed of the imployment, That 'tis against himselfe, I may with justice Accuse my want of judgement, to expect He should performe so hard an imposition: I would I could not thinke of any man, They rob me of my peace: I prethee try Thy voyce, to put my heart in better tune; There is a power in harmony, some say, To charme the unruly motions of the braine: Love is it selfe a melancholy madnesse: Why should not Musicke cure the wound of love? Melancholy hence, goe get Some piece of earth to be thy seat, Here the ayre and nimble fire, Would shoot up to meet desire: Sullen humour, leave her blood, Mix not with the purer floud, But let pleasures swelling there, Make a Spring-tide all the yeere. Enter Chrysolina. Chry. How does my deare Eugenia? Eug. As well As this restraint will give me leave, and yet It does appeare a part of my enlargement To have your company: I hope your sister Enjoyes her health. Chry. And more felicity Than I can boast mine owne, shee's halfe a Bride. Happy ith'embraces of her wished servant; You know our story; he ha's chosen her, And most uncivilly neglecteth me. Thus laden with his scorne, I come to practise A scene of sorrow w'ye; sure thy fate Hath spun a thread for me, we are so like In our misfortunes: Have you heard no newes Of your ingratefull servant, for I know No other name, and he indeed deserves To have no other memory, that takes A pride in his disdaine. Eug. Nothing as yet. But I have met occasion to convey A Letter to him, yet I cannot promise: Enter Yongrave. But here's the messenger. Chr. That Gentleman? I know the man you love then, is't not Thornay? Eug. The same, I did conceale him for his shame. Chr. Why hee's a zealous suiter for my love. Yon. It makes for me that he continues cruell; I was not able to command his passion. But will she not mistrust I have not beene So carefull in advancing her desires, But satisfied my selfe with any answer, As knowing what must bring comfort to her, Must needs be killing to my hopes? In what A narrow path I tread; her spring must be My frost, and when her tree carries the pride And bloome of summer, I retaine no sap, But wither and creepe backward into earth, Like a forsaken plant. Chr. Here Ile obscure. Chrysolina withdrawes. Eug. You are welcome, Sir. Yon. I would I were. Eug. Shall I beleeve you have beene faithfull to My griefes request? Yon. Yes, and bring comfort backe. Chrys. How's that? Eug. Pronounce those words agen. Yon. I bring you comfort. Eug. He did say so: What meant she To mocke me with another sad relation? Was't a device in her to increase my joy At meeting, he did talke of comfort; is it A thing restor'd in nature? Oh, before You blesse my eare agen with that wished sound, Excuse my modesty, if my heart present A kisse to thanke you. Yon. I drinke in my poyson. Eug. Now let your comforts flow. Yon. I have returned you As true a lover as yet ever Mistris Could boast possession of, one so resolved To honour you. Eug. Can this be possible? Yon. I have examined every secret thought Within his soule, concerning you, and dare Thus boldly justifie, he is your owne. Eug. Let me but live to see him, and I write My ambition satisfied Yon. He's here. Eug. Where? Yo. Here. In me your truest servant is return'd. Chr. Does he affect her? Yon. I call all that's good To witnesse with me, I discharg'd with zeale The unkind office to my selfe, but could not Incline him to returne to any softnesse: In briefe, he has unworthily engag'd That heart belonging to you, and would not be Provoked to see you agen. Chr. Eugenia. Chr. leads in Eug. Yon. Is all this waking? Have I seene her faint? And did not she that cherishes her enemy, Haste to her reliefe, and seeme to suffer with her? While I, as one had growne here, did not move? I did not well, to exalt her with a hope: To meet a blessing, and then ruine her. If death hath whisper'd her aside, I shall Be accused, and I will take my preferment To be sent after her to tell her ghost I lov'd her best, when wee are both immortall She'l understand me better. Enter Chrysolina. Is Eugenia alive agen? Chr, There is no danger to be fear'd; a qualme. Pray let me aske you Sir one question, Doe you affect this Virgin really? I move it not for any harme. Yon. Would she had sent you hither, But with desire to be resolv'd. Chr. May be she has. Yon. Then tell her I doe love her better— Than I can expresse, but when she has Numbred all things are excellent on earth She is to me above 'em infinitely. Chr. This carries no probability. Yon. Would thou wert a man Then I durst tell thee, I doe love her so I durst be wicked for her, and kill thee. Chr. With all this, it does not appeare you love her so And be an instrument, nay plead to put another in possession Of your lov'd treasure; for if I mistake not You late did urge a man, whom shee esteemed Better, to returne and marry her: Can any man that loves a woman truly, Strive to supplant himselfe and give away His comfort? Yon. There's the honour of my service, When I am dead, the story shall remember I lov'd a maid so well that I prefer'd Whatever she desired above my selfe, And cause she lou'd one better, was content, To serve her wishes with my banishment: He does not love a Virgin nobly, whose Affection walkes not just to her desires, To like e'm 'bove his owne. Chr. If this can be, Thou art the noblest lover in the world, With what affection shall shee be blest That loves him, when the mistresse that esteemes Him not, is thus rewarded? Enter Eugenia. Eug. Indeed I love him still and shall doe ever, Nor had I now returnd to life, but that I had not tooke my leave of him. Yon. More corrosive. Eug. If you'l oblige a Virgin, For ever to you once more visit him, Tell him I lye like one thats desperate sicke, Opprest with griefe of body, and of mind, But cannot be so fortunate to quit The world till he vouchsafe to visit me. Bid him not feare I will detaine him long With idle talke, sixe words and I am dead. Although he love me not, he may doe this: If you will adde this to your other worke, I will impose no more, indeed I will not: So farewell noble Sir. Exit. Chr. If you will please to joyne with me, I doubt not To effect her wishes. Yon. No. Chr. You doe not know what power I have with him. Yon. You have too much Chr. Ile undertake— Yon. You sha'not rob me of the reward. Chr. What reward? Yon. Perhaps another kisse; pray tell her, I Went cheerefully to finish her command. Exit. Chr. I doe admire and love this noble temper, What flames are these? Suppresse 'em, they grow high, If he affect her so, what hope have I? Ex. Enter Gerard and Thornay. Tho. Mad? why you still enjoy discourse. Ger. What then? may not a man be mad, and yet talke wisely? Tho. But few in my experience. Ger. Doe not abuse thy knowledge, at the worst Thou canst but say, our senses are deprav'd, Throwne off o'th'hinge; the tongue is none I hope, Though some would have the titillation Ioynd to make up a sixth in the grave Synode: Beleeve then I am mad; Ile prov't by reason. Thor. By reason? that's a new way to prove it; But Ile heare no reason. Ger. Then thou art mad thy selfe. Thor. Nay, I thinke I am madder o'th two, And have as much reason, if there bee reason Able to make one mad; but let's be wise: Or if it must be that y'ave lost your wits, Let's see and wee can recover e'm by drinking; For hee that is not sober after drunkennesse, Is no man of this world. Ger. Now thou talkest wildly. Thor. I talke wildly, that would justifie my selfe to bee in my wits, and you that talk reason and sense wo'not beleeve y'ave any. Ger. If it bee so, that may conclude I ha' lost 'em, And doe not understand my selfe. Thor. So, so, I should beleeve another in that argument, But not you, for in knowing that, you prove You are no mad-man. Ger. Prethee tell mee, thou art a peece of a Philosopher, And knowest the naturall causes. Thor. Hold in that; I must confesse, you are little Beside your selfe: I a Philosopher? I studied Titelman sometimes i'th College, As others did, and wanting Epictetus Lanthorne, slept alwaies with a watching Candle In my study window, and might very well Dreame over learning o'my Deske, or so; What Aristotle might infuse into My sleepes I know not, but waking I nere troubled My selfe to understand him; true I lov'd His Booke De Cœlo, for the heavenly Title, And made my Father buy it, for my study Of Divinity, told him I would be a Bishop; That brought me threescore pound a yeere for sacke: I prethee doe not talke of learning. Ger. Why then acknowledge, I am mad, and I have done. Thor. Well for this once I will allow it, th'art mad. Ger. But wherefore doe y'allow it, what's the cause? Thor. Nay, nay, I know not that. Ger. Ile tell thee then. Thor. Tis come about agen. Ger. And let thy judgement censure mee If I produce not able reasons— Thor. To prove madnesse, he makes me mad to heare him: Now I consider better on't, I confesse You have some cause to be a little mad, The losse of such a Mistresse. Ger. But of one? Did they not both affect mee, and I them With such equality of honour. Thor. Grant it. Ger. And I to lose 'em both? faith speake but honestly; Is't not a wonder that I doe not rave And kill my selfe? how many have runne mad For one that never lov'd 'em? and shall I Bee so unmannerly not to lose my wits For two and two such creatures? twere a Solecisme In love: I prethee doe not flatter mee With an opinion that I have my reason; It cannot bee, it is against all sense, I should haue any; such an expectation Lost, is enough to make the genius Of all the world runne mad, and I will straight. Thor. Whither? Ger. To Bedlem, whether should I goe? I must not live in this community of fooles and wisemen. Thor. There be Knaves among us. Ger. Here all are happy, there I sha'not meet With lovers that are fortunate, but with men Of my complexion, that looke twenty wayes At once, that sigh and curse, and sing mad Carols: If I can get to bee their Prince, Ile make A law it shall bee death to smile or kisse A woman. Thor. Now I feare him. Ger. Nay, wee'le have An excellent well governd Common wealth, A delicate Eutopia, there shall be Lectures and publike readings shall put downe Grissame foundation for the liberall Arts, And make the Citizens bring their Shop-bookes hither To take fine notes, how to bee paid their debts, And yet trust none but younger brothers: then Wee will have penall Statutes against eating, Live all by the ayre of commendations. No idle man shall live within our State: Doe y'marke? they are the mouthes of the Republike: And therefore hee that has no other worke To prevent slothfulnesse, may imploy his time In picking strawes, there will be a great plenty. Here will wee live together, and bee mad Perpetually, wee wo'not bee recovered; For if at any time wee incline to bee Sober, and comming to our wits againe, The lash will whip us into new distempers And mad fugaries. Thor. Doe y'know all this while What you have said, you correct me for speaking Extravagantly, and yet talke wilde your selfe. Ger. I prethee pardon and instruct me better; I am not well. Thor. Will you walke to your Chamber, Ile beare you company. Ger. No, I am well againe. Vpon condition you will tell Aurelia Shee did not use me kindly. Thor. I will. Ger. She did not use me kindly, nothing else, Farewell. Exit. Thor. I know not what to thinke on him, The unhappinesse was so sudden, and unlook'd for, It might disturbe his fancy, but I hope The worst is past, a little rest will settle him. But which way shall I recompence the injury: I ha' done him? and I had not been ungratefull To Eugenia, wee might have both beene happy. Enter Yongrave. Ha? 'tis hee: Save you most Noble Sir; Ift please you now, Ile goe along with you Toth'Gentlewoman. Yon. What Gentlewoman? Thor. Eugenia, that wrote the Letter to me, I meane her. Yon. For what? Tho. I ha' considered better, &amp; doe meane To make her satisfaction. Yon. 'Tis too late; You might have done this earlier, your love Will appeare now unseasonable, I assure you. Thor. Pray give me a reason. Yon. D'ye not blush to aske it? I told her what you said, and now we are Resolv'd; you cannot blame her, she was covetous To embrace you; but your answer being return'd So peremptorily in her neglect, we both agreed. Thor. You both? Why what was that to you? Yon. That doubt will cleere it selfe when we are married. Tho. Why, did you love her? Yon. And deserve her best Of all the world: and yet shee'd give me no Assurance till she knew your resolution, Which I was able to informe her, and 'Tis now a bargaine; upon munday next.— Thor. Your wedding day. Yon. Right. Thor. In very good time. You weare a sword. Yon. What then? Thor. Ile only try how you can fence, I must not lose her so. Yon. You lose her? you despis'd her, wo'd not see her, Not to recover her from death. D'yee not Remember such a saying, In the Towne Were many yonger brothers, that might be Content to marry her; let her use her fortune, For your owne part, you were engag'd, there was No wrestling with your fate: Was it not so? Thor. 'Tis all one for that, my mind is altred, I'm of another humour now, and will Maintaine, I love her better than you dare. Yo. Then I must tell you. Tho. Tell me no tellings: Either resigne her to me againe, or— Yon. Resolve me, pray, can you affect her heartily? Thor. Else let me perish on your sword. Yon. I heard You court another Mistris, that did answer it with entertainment. Thor. She was a very Gipsie. You were no sooner parted, but she us'd me Basely; 'tis true, I did sufficiently Deserve it, for my breach of vow to her I now alone doe honour, and for whom, (Chang'd into honesty) I will rather dye Than live without her. Yo. Heaven do's heare all this. Thor. I make no doubt, and while my heart to hee Is reconcil'd, cannot despaire of mercie. Yon. You shall have her. Thor. Shall I? then Ile love thee too. Yon. And know, she ha's no thought but to be yours, There ha's no obligation past betwixt us two. I came for this: yet I must tell you, Sir, I love her too, and shall doe ever. Thor. How? not when She is my wife, I hope. Yon. Yes then. Thor. If you have cut her up, and left her cold meat, I shall lose my stomacke. Yon. With a holy flame, Her vertue keeps a Vestall fire within me, But she affects not me, yet I might challenge her: Nor can you ever, but in right of me, Glory your selfe possest; I have bought her. Thor. I hope she ha's not sold her maidenhead. Yo. Her vncle (Whose aime is onely profit) hath concluded With me a price for her, and therefore gives Accesse to none, till I ha' prov'd my fortune; But I finde her devoted to you onely, And have conform'd my wishes unto hers: She loves you best, and I preferre you too, Returne, and be her husband, Ile direct you. Enter Caperwit and Dancer. Cap. You understand my purpose, you shall make The Dance, let me alone to write the songs. Dan. A Maske will be delightfull to the Ladies. Cap. Oh Sir, what Playes are taking without these Pretty devices? Many Gentlemen Are not, as in the dayes of understanding. Now satisfied without a Iigge, which since They cannot, with their honour, call for, after The play, they looke to be serv'd up ith'middle: Your dance is the best language of some Comedies, And footing runnes away with all; a Scene Exprest with life of Art, and squar'd to nature, Is dull and flegmatick Poetry. Tho. Enough; I am bound to honour thee, command my life, Thou excellent young man. Yon. I wish you happinesse and never after her will love a woman. Cap. You know my lodging. Dan. Ile attend you Sir. Exit. Cap. I wonder what's become of my hermaphrodyte? Yongrave, how is't man? what art melancholy? What hath hung plummets on thy nimble soule, What sleepie rod hath charmd thy mounting spirit? Yon. Prethee enjoy thy selfe. Cap. By Parnassus You must not be so headhung, why dost peep— Vnder thy cloake as thou didst feare a Serjeant? Enter Simple and Lady Bird. Who are these? my wish! fortune hath sent thee a cure, The rarest mirth! you sha'not lose it, ha, ha. Bir. You have strangely wonne me to obey you Sir, I refuse nothing you command. Sim. Shalt go, And heare how I will talke, and baffle 'em. But what if wee meet Caperwit? Bir. No matter. Sim. No: w'y then let him goe hang himselfe in his owne verses, if the line be strong enough, come my Nightingale, my Bird of Paradise. Exit. Cap. If ever thou didst love me, lets follow 'em; Feede not this sullen humour, Ile promise excellent sport. Yon. You shall prevaile. Ex. Enter Chrysolina, Aurelia. Chr. It was not kindly done, beleeve me sister, He did performe but our request. Aur. Tis granted; But his neglect of you afflicted me. Chr. He could not make you happy, and remaine Servant to me. Aur. Nor make me blest, while you Seem'd discontented. Chr. Doe not thinke I was, I did but carry trouble in my face, When he declared himselfe, withdrew my smiles, For your sake, to make you appeare most lovely, And worthy of his choice; and could you be So cruell to reject him, when he came To be confirm'd your owne without a rivall? It seemes he did not know who lov'd him best. Aur. Best? Chr. Yes, and I in this, will mak't appeare, That now you have exild him from your love, Ile sue for his affection. Aur. He is mine. Chr. But you Aurelia are not his; I will Appeale to his modest reason, that shall guide His eye to looke on both agen, I doe not See what in me should not invite him hither, With as much ardor, rather more, since he Hath prov'd already your too much unkindnesse; What if this noble Gentleman should lose His wits upon't, will all your beautie call His straggling senses to their seate agen? Ile seeke him out betimes and comfort him. Aur. Tis more than will become you sister. Chr. How? Aur. And it must bring your modesty in question, To follow one that cares not for you. Chr. Thus I may awake his noble flame, nor is it Any dishonor when the world shall know How you have us'd him, if I make returne, To what I lov'd so deerely. Aur. Not while I may challeng interest; here are company Enter Simple, Bird, Yongrave, Caperwit aloofe. Let us withdraw, I have something more to tell you. Chr. Deferre it rather now; here comes my hope. Aur. How's this? nay then Ile stay a little longer. Sim. By your leave Gentlewomen, I should mock you To call you Ladies; perhaps you may wonder at me. Chr. I see no cause. Sim. Have you no eyes? Aur. Such as you see? Sim. Oh eyes no eies but Mountaines fraught with teares! Chr. Hee's turnd Ieronymo. Sim. Goe by, Ieronymo, goe by, goe by. He passeth by them with disdaine. Chr. Doe y'know where you are? Sim. Yes, and to whom I speake I hope. Aur. Noble Sir, I hope you doe not scorne us. Sim. Scorne you, no, but I doe not care a rush for you, you might have had me when I was offered, tis none of my fault, and you doe fall to eating of chalke, and dye oth'black jaundise, I cannot helpe it now for I proclaime, here is the what doe y'call it, of my heart. Aur. Has he wonne this Lady? I suspect her: I hope you have not quite forsaken me; Virgins for custome sake, sometimes deny, Beleeve me Sir, when you did plead for love My heart did not so much as think on't. Sim. Nay tis no matter, I ha' tooke my course, yet I Have a sute to you that you would not breake your heart, Nor yon, to see us kisse. Nectar! immortall nectar! He kisses Bird. Oh let this Diamond purchase such another, Tis pitty that my lips should ever open, To let the breath she gave me, out agen. Chr. Doe y'pay so much for every kisse? a Diamond? Sim. I never offer lesse to touch her lip; marry her hand, or her a—or foote or so, I may salute for a ruby, or an emrode or a satire; or so, but I have stones—now doe thou speake a little for their further mortification. Bir. I did not thinke to have returnd so soone A trouble to you but the importunity Of this most worthy Gentleman prevail'd, I thinke there was some Magick in his tongue. Sim. Nay you may sweare that, the wisest in the country, thought my mother a Witch. Bir. He did no sooner open his desires, But he did wound my heart, you see his bounty, What jewels hee has given mee. Sim. All thine owne; somebody else might ha' been wise and had 'em. Cap. Somebody else might have been wise, and kept 'em. Bir. I must confesse, I lov'd another lately, but his affection's frozen up— Cap. Blesse you bevy of Ladies. Bir. Sir, you are come most seasonably, before These Gentlewomen, I release your promise, My thoughts are fixt upon this Noble Knight, Affect now where you please; here is my husband. Cap. You are not married? Sim. No, but I came to bid you all to my wedding, I have Bespoke Gloves, and Points, and knacks, and knaveries. Cap. I will dye Hymens Saffron robe in blood, Put out the Torches with the teares of Virgins, And make the Temple quake. Sim. Will you so Sir? Cap. Excellent Rascall! Bir. There is no way but to acknowledge it, It is no shame in love, there's no disgrace, For else by Law he may recover mee. Sim. Doe y'heare Sir, you may take her if you please, but if she be troubled with a timpany, there is a man within a mile of an Oke. I name no body, that has hell,—some earnest of her body. Cap. I hope you doe but Iest. Sim. Ile make all sure. What a loving Lady is this? Cap. Then I require you give me back this Diamond, The token once I gave of my devotion. Sim. Why that's mine, I gave it her but how before all this company. Bir. Be wild and let him have it, 'tis like his within my Cabinet, let's be quit on him, this will secure our marriage. Sim. Let him have it there bee more in Cheapeside, but let's not tarry, any longer Bird, hee'le challenge all the rest of thy fathers. Bir. I will obey you Sir. Sim. Farewell beauties and kind Gentleman, if you come to my wedding, I name no time, nor place, wee'l be very merry, excellent cheere Ile promise you, your belly full of Fidlers. Cap. Ha, ha. Exit Sim. and Bir. Aur. What did you meane? that Ring was his. Cap. The Boy shall ha't agen: ha, ha, you do not know the mysterie, this Lady is a boy, a very crackrope boy. Au. Is't possible? Cap. I made him first disguise himselfe. Aur. Indeed? Cap. Yes faith, to come to you. Aur. Then I must tell you Sir, you have not us'd us civilly, to make our conversation ridiculous, To talke and complement with a Boy. Cap. Sweet Lady, by Hyppocrene— Aur. Doe y'not thinke your wit found out a precious device to make me love you by a president; is this your great Lady? Cap. Doe but heare mee speake. Aur. Not now, I know you have art enough to excuse it, Yet I am not mercilesse, let mee entreate Your absence, without ceremony, when You come agen, your talke will bee more musicall. Cap. Doe's shee not prophesie the conceit, I goe The Maske will doo't, more musicall? tis so. Exit. Chr. Then hee's gone to her Yon. Hee did promise mee. Chr. Let other Virgins when they heare this story Wonder, but give mee leave to love you for it, Indeed I doe; looke not so strange, your vertue Compels mee to reveale it, tis no shame To owne a passion, kindled by such goodnesse. Yon. If I doe understand you, give mee pardon, To thinke you are not perfectly advis'd; I am a prisoner still to my Eugenia. Chr. Shee is satisfied, and you are disingaged. Yon. But shee has not yet resignd the heart I gave, Nor can I thinke of any other Mistresse; Choose in a plenty of more happy men, I gave too much away to love agen. Exit. Chr. I will retire to blush and weepe. Aur. Not so. Alas poore sister, now I feare you not, I see your purpose was to make mee kinde: I wo'd hee were my brother, but let's in And joyne our heads, some counsell would doe well, Tis pitty wee two should leade Apes in hell.

Are these my Thornays armes? are those his lips? Can hee repent his cruelty and love? How soone are all my teares dryed up? I doe Forgive my griefes, and thinke they have been modest, And gentle sufferings, who can merit such A joy, that has not felt a world of sorrow? Let us imbrace agen, and if thou canst Confirme mee yet more, that I am awake, And taste my true delight. Thor. By this, and this: Kisses. Through which, if it were possible, I durst Conuey my soule, I am for ever thine, Created new to bee made worthy of thee, I have beene dead too long to thee, and vertue, Committed sinne enough, in my neglect Of thee, to plant a fierce, and deepe antipathy In every womans heart against mankind; But you are mercifull, and imitate The eternall nature.

What and we should set some on's house a-fire, Doe y'thinke he would stay to quench it? how has he Liv'd all this while, and has no more diseases? No honest Gout to keepe him warme at home, In furres, no charitable Ague, fall Into his legges to stay him, no Sciatica? He is no Gentleman he scapes so well. Eugenia reades. I love him above my life, but you have only his heart, he sayes; for which I languish, if you have power to dispose it, I will cherish some hope, he will love me, at least for your sake. Tho. If he should with us, is't not possible He may have a fall, and breake a leg, and t'were but his neck, why may not some prentice throw a stone, and put an eye out, that he may goe to th'Surgeons, or some horse, or cart-wheele squeeze his toe, and stay his journey?

Nay, never blush, but haste and meet the Gentleman. You have no reason to distrust me, Lady, After this circumstance. Chr. Can I be so happy? Thor. Have a strong faith, and finde it so, Though once I was guilty of some wrong to thee. Chry. Never to me: or if you had, this newes Is recompence enough. Thor. Ile tell thee now: I was the cause that Gerard did neglect thee, In hope to gaine thee for my selfe; I told him Thou had'st halfe consented to be mine. Chr. This truth? Thor. Bade him direct his Courtship to Aurelia, And so be sure of one: poore Gentleman Beleev'd, and after lost thy sister too: But if no cure be seasonably apply'd, Gerard, I feare, will sinke beneath his losse. Chr. Was this the cause? Thor. I must accuse my selfe. Chr. Ile tell Aurelia this. Tho. Doe so. Chr. She meant to visit him, but this wil give her wings. Thor.

I know y'ave heard wherein consists my excellence. Th. You are a Prince in Poetry, &amp; please your Excellence. Cap. The phrase in Latine's modest, use no reverence, To tell you true, you are a friend, I am upon a Maske.— Tho. That made you aske if I could dance. Cap. 'Tis right, and you should doe me honour To lend your person to it, but I wo'd Have it this night, before my Mistris, whose Mention perfum'd your lips so late. Thor. Sweet language! Wy'your favour, Mr. Caperwit, who are the Principall Maskers? Cap. Faith I have none yet, Beside my selfe, but a foolish Knight, one Sir Gervace, And's Lady, I want persons. Thor. Let me furnish you. Cap. And tye my everlasting friendship to you. Th. They shall be of quality, most of your acquaintance. What if Aurelia be one? she loves you, I ha' discovered that; I know shee'l do't, Her Sister for another, and my selfe, Frank Gerard and Iack Yongrave, with his Mistris. Cap. The number I desire. Thor. I know your lodging, say no more, Ile bring 'em, This afternoone to practise, we may soone Perfect a dance. Cap. Shall I trust to you? Thor. Here's my hand. Cap. I kisse it. Thor. I may give you a hint perhaps for the device too. Cap. I have no other gratitude but this, Live but a weeke, Ile send you an Ode; or dye, Ile write your Epitaph. Exit. Thor.

Enter Gerard in his gowne and cap. Ger.

Enter servant. Ser. Sir, tis done. Ger. I prethee let it be vndone, as I am. Ser. The Song, Ger. I gave to be taught Musicke? Ile hear't anon: I prethee goe— Ser. Whither? Ger. To Prison. Ser. How Sir? Ger. Yes, and aske when are the Sessions. Ser. They are every moneth. Ger. I would 'twere execution day to morrow. Ser. Why, with your pardon, doe you wish it, Sir? Ger. I would intreat the Surgeons to beg Some Woman for Anatomy, nothing else: I have heard their Lectures very much commended, And I'd be present when they read upon Her heart: for sure there is much difference Betweene a Woman and a Man, in that Same thing we call a heart, they doe not love As we doe; we are fooles, indeed we are, To dote so much upon 'em, and betray The glory of our creation, to serve A female pride; we were borne free, and had From the great Maker Royall priviledge, Most brave immunities: but since have made Tame forfeit of our Charter. Let me see't, It is the same, first read it, reach the chaire: Tis yet no Song, infuse a soule into it. Song. If Love his Arrowes shoot so fast, Soone his feathered stocke will waste: But I mistake in thinking so, Love's Arrowes in his Quiver grow: How can he want Artillery? That appeares too true in mee: Two shafts feed upon my brest, Oh, make it Quiver for the rest, Kill me with love, thou angry sonne Of Cytherea, or let one, One sharpe golden Arrow flye, To wound her heart for whom J dye. Cupid, if thou bee'st a Childe, Be no god, or be more milde. Enter Aurelia and Servant. Ser. I have not, since I serv'd him, knowne him so Opprest with melancholy; hee's a sleepe, I dare not wake him. Aur. Ile expect a while. Ser. This quiet will much benefit him, hee Began to talke idly. Aur. Heaven preserve the temper of his braine. Ser. He wakes. Ger. Ha, tis not shee, doe I dreame still; Come hither, dost thou see nothing? Ser. Yes, a Gentlewoman that came to visit you. Ger. Doe not abuse thy master, 'tis not possible Aurelia Will doe me so much honour; in my sleepe Me thought I parled with her, and my fancy Hath not yet lost her shape; Oh my Aurelia! Aur. I come to aske thy pardon. Ger. Doe not mocke me. Thou wo't bee cruell when I wake agen; And then I shall repent I dream't so sweetly. Aur. Y'are now awake, and I am your Aurelia, That if you can forgive her past neglect, Will give you proofe of her repentance, By these teares— Ger. Let not the ground be hallowed with Such water, I have a heart to drinke this Balsome: Enough Aurelia, doe not make thy eyes Poore, to enrich thy bosome, where the drops Shew like a Carkanet of Pearle upon it, Thou hast enough restor'd mee. Aur. Oh my Gerard! Thou art too mercifull, and dost forgive Too soone the injury I did thy love; But I am come to make thee satisfaction; And this is but a shadow of those joyes, Wee must divide, if you vouchsafe to follow, As I direct. Ger. Tis sinne not to obey. Aur. You must walk then. Ger. It is to heaven thou goest. Convey mee swiftly thither. Aur. Nay, tis hast is now required. Ger. What blisse can bee deny'd, A man that followes such an Angell-guide? Exeunt. Enter Thumpe. Thum. Where in the name of simplicity, should my Master be all this while?

Enter Thornay, Chrysol. Here is another youth, and his commodity, I'le enquire of him, Pray did you see my Master? Thor. Thy Master, what's he. Thum.
