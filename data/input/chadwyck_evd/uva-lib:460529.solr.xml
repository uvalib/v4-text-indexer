      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âLaurel grove beneath the temple at Delphi. Enter Sextus, Aruns, and Brutus. Sextus. Who kisses first his mother shall be king: So said the priestess. Oh, for sovereignty, Goal of my disposition! I will run A vehement, hot race for it. Away! Aruns. I am the elder-born, and prophecy Dare not prevail against me. Fortune's name! The Dullard tumbles. [To Brutus.] Find thy feet again When we are out of sight! [Exeunt, running in rivalry. Brutus. Smoke of Cassotis, thou art in my brain! I reel to think of it,âvile Tullia's lips Shall give supremacy? The groaning hordes Of the Cloaca, the dulled labourers, Learn no interpretation of their doom: The Lycian king forgets he was a slave; The gods are despots. Thou deep, dewy grass, Thou hast my kiss. [Kneels, and passionately kisses the earth.] Is this the mystery? Then would I be a dullard! Yet, O Earth, Thy children shall be precious in my sight, Their sweat remembered, and their blood avenged. Now will I slowly home. My cherry-staff Is gone, but I stand firm upon my feet: I have received the messageâLord of Rome! [Exit. Scene II. âThe Roman Camp before Ardea. A tent: revelry and feasting. Sextus, Aruns, Collatinus, and Brutus. Sextus. Let us wreathe the mighty cup, Then with song we'll lift it up, And, before we drain the glow Of the juice that foams below Flowers and cool leaves round the brim, Let us swell the praise of him Who is tyrant of the heart, Cupid with his flaming dart. Pride before his face is bowed, Strength and heedless beauty cowed; Underneath his fatal wings Bend, discrowned, the heads of kings; Maidens blanch beneath his eye, And its laughing mastery; Through each land his arrows sound; By his fetters all are bound. Aruns. Brother, I drink; yet verily I swear You are so bent on empire that you praise The monarchy of love with jealous tones. Yet is your rule assured, for you were first To take the seal of Delphic prophecy From pressure of our mother's startled mouth. You hold the bond of Fate, and yet you cherish A grudging humour in your very worship Of lordly Cupid. Sextus. I would have all things Mine to their centre. Aruns. Dullard, do you hear? He'd reach the core of your stupidity, And call it his. Brutus. My common, homely pith, Like that within the votive cherry-wand I gave the god at Delphi! It is stuff Scarce worth a prince's grasp. [Aside.] I filled the wood With gold, confessing, in Apollo's sight, My inner nature brutishly involved, And covered up with folly. Aruns. Collatine, He laid a knotted staff upon the altar. 'Twas richly clownish. Brutus. [Aside.] As it ever is To dedicate oneself. Collatinus. Fantastic friend, What meant thy deed? Brutus. I could not cheat the god With dazzling show, who am a simpletonâ [Aside] A mask I wear to save my forfeit life From royal sentence, and I fear its weight Presses my brain. I shall grow imbecile. Sextus. He fell among the laurels of the temple, Tripped by his stumbling feet. 'Tis piteous How chance for ever treats him as her slave. [To Brutus.] Hast been to watch the workmen in the fosse, Hast balanced every sigh against each lash, And registered the spadefuls of red earth, As it were dyed with blood? Comrades, I've seen Our lack-brain Lucius stand an hour in silence Watching the filthy toil. Brutus. [Aside.] Because I share The dumb, subservient, despairing life Of these degraded thousands, and my heart Beats slowly to their sluggish pulses, I Am made a beast by kingly wickedness, Derided and unpitied; I, as they, Have hints of mighty faculties within, Dim, terrible, august. Sextus. Leave muttering! These herds who found our palaces, and raise Our temple on the Capitol, are born As cattle for their labour; stripes alone Can teach the rout activity. Enough! Such slavish vermin are no festal theme. We'll serve these delicates. Ho! bring wild figs, A dish of honey! While our appetites Are tempted by the choicest viands, such As luxury is sage enough to relish, Our Dullard in his pot of humble sweet Shall dip his sorry fruit. We'll watch him feed To give conviviality an edge. Yet pleasure languishes. Let's drink our wives. Here's to my Lesbia! She's dark as night, And, like the night, is amorous; her breast Pillows my triumph; for my sake she breathes, Desires, adorns her beauty. Aruns. So her husband Dreams with unstinted confidence. I drink Lucilia, my white, adoring wife, With jewelled face so shine her sapphire-glances To meet me, and her lips unloose their bud, Parting a rose of welcome for endearments Of summer breath. Sextus. [Aside.] She gives the rosy greeting To all who dare to visit her. Collatinus. My turn! Lucretia, to thy perfect self I drink, And feel my homage injury. Sextus. Declare Her beauties, her complexion, and her virtue. Collatinus. Blithe modesty, free honour, loveliness That hath its sweet protection in itself,â These are her praise, her holy wealth, and glory. The flush of vernal bloom is on her cheek, If she but breathe her heartfelt thoughts; her brows Are golden as the pure moon's youngest curve, Golden her hair; as unclosed marigolds, Her brown, unfaltering eyes meet gracious looks, And take them for the sun; her lips, like shells, Bear music round their rims, and in her voice The ear hath all her beauty o'er again. So young she is, I feel a happy boy, And yet a tender husband, when we kiss. Sextus. [Aside.] He kindles me, I'm angry at his prize; It is too much for any but a king. [Aloud.] You boast. Collatinus. No, Sextus, 'tis the blessÃ¨d truth. Aruns. You wrong our spouses with such shameless vaunts. Sextus. Let us to Rome and settle our dispute. Now in the unsuspecting midnight watches, We'll spy our wives, and learn what cheer they keep, Making comparison of rival claims, Who shall be titled perfect. Aruns. Let's away. Come, Brutus, stutter forth thy Publia's praise, Then will we visit her, and laugh to find Our honest soldier's place hath been supplied By some less warlike Roman. Brutus. Ride alone! For Publia is waiting my return. There would be no surprise, if that's the drift Of your strange talk. She makes a ruddy hearth, And runs to meet me when she hears my step. That's all I boast of. [Exit. Aruns. Heavy-witted speech! He has no care for beauty. Sextus. [Aside.] Am I mad? Anticipation and a hungry pain, Like joy, are in me at the very thought Of meeting this Lucretia. She is chaste!â A word to rouse the king that's absolute Within my breast. Shall Collatinus rule, And brag as he were owner of a realm Unconquerably his? [Aloud.] Let horses wait! [Aside.] Impatience swells against my heart, and stirs Imagination's wild fecundity, Begetting hopes and possibilities Of exultation. Collatinus. 'Tis a moving sky, That casts a solemn veil o'er Dian's face, As she were robed for death. Sextus. Mount, mount! Collatinus. I win. [Exeunt. Scene III. âA chamber in the house of Collatinus at Collatia. Girls spinning; Lucretia at the door, looking toward the camp fires of Ardea. Lucretia. The stars Do not now entertain me. All my thoughts Are of my lord. How gracious are the gods To give us women, in our lonely hours, The very secret joy and company Of our too distant loves! How could I bear These parted months, save for this mystery, This urgent, throbbing triumph at my heart, This something that shall tell him how Lucrece Doth in her bosom rate her Collatine, This living message! O my child, my son, Thy father must return that I may break The joyous news; and yet I'll keep it close; It is not for the lips. O thou and I What welcome we will weave for him! I prate. We who are mothers must be diligent, And live by pious rule, that, in the womb, Our sons may feel the discipline of law, Restraining even such sweet impulses As carry us to Ardea. Girls, we'll spin Till midnight, for to-day we have not wrought Our measured task. We must repair our sloth, And force our too impatient drowsiness To wait our pleasure. Merrily to work! Virgilia,âah, you must not be o'ertasked. [Aside.] A little orphan maid. [Aloud.] Go, child, to bed, At break of morning to your work again, With swifter shuttle. I will take your wheel. [Exit Virgilia. [Aside.] It irks me, for I'm restless. 1st Maid. Mistress, stay! There's noise without of soldiers, and they come Closer, as they were drawing to the house. I tremble, lest perchance an enemyâ 2nd Maid. Nay, that is Roman laughter. Lady, list! It may be from the camp. Lucretia. A messenger. Your lord comes not with drunken revelry; I never yet have heard him, ere I saw. [Enter Collatinus and the Princes.] Ah, he has guests, and hospitality Raises this clamour. Dear my lord, I find You're giving welcome. May I to your side As hostess? [Goes up to Collatinus caressingly; greets the princes.] 'Tis most gracious thus to steal An hour from camp. As cousins it were kind, As princes 'tis a favour. Aruns. Ah, design Is in our visit; we have made the round Of our wives' chambers; the fair enemy Was taken unawares. But Collatine Insisted, with a bridegroom's arrogance, Wisdom and circumspection would be found Guarding his walls. Lucretia. It is most natural He should be fearless, coming to his home. Sweet princes, that betwixt my lord and you There should be disputation, I must grieve; But bless ye heartily for bringing him Homeward, on any pretext. Collatinus. [Pointing to the maidens spinning.] Look within. Sextus. [Aside.] I cannot speak to her. Shame's on my lips. She should have been my captive. Oh, how swift The order to my tent! What works in me? Ye gods, she is no stranger to my eyes; I oft encountered her at feasts, a girl So unambitious that I slighted her, Courting disdainful Lesbia for my wife. How is she changed! Is it the marriage rite That thus hath sweetly wrought on her? Oh then, The lady Juno can invest with charm Out-matching Venus' lures. She is superb, Radiant and free, and doth confer her face Frankly as PhÅbus his gold-dropping rays. Have I no manners that I follow her With stupid stare soon as she moves away, And through my burning, hidden temples feel Near me her queenly step? Were we alone, . . . Aruns. [To Collatinus.] I must commend the beaming diligence Of this fair company. You've won the wage; Yet on one's slighter hours such industry Would pall. Lucretia, do you play the lute? Lucretia. Yes, to myself, until I quite forget Who makes the music. I must have sweet sounds About my ears; the fountain and my bees Content me in the garden, but within There must be tunes. Aruns. Well, play to us. Lucretia. [Looking toward Collatinus.] Another must command. Sextus. [Aside.] Nothing in common! [Aloud.] Yet if we entreat . . . Lucretia. O cousin Sextus, there's no singing-match Betwixt us. Tidings of the oracle? I burn to hear. Sextus. I shall be lord of Rome. Lucretia. Did the gods presage that? Aruns. He's impudent. Delphi foretold Rome's rulership to him Who first embraced his mother. He out-ran, Being superstitious. Lucretia. There were three of you. What said our Dullard to the prophecy? Aruns. He was left grovelling on the earth. Lucretia. Beware How you interpret! Yet to rule our Rome . . . Sextus. [Aside.] Ah, what a sigh! She would have empery. [Aloud.] When I am tyrant . . . Lucretia. O Tarquinius, Use not that word. As Roman soldier earn Your civic triumph. See the oak-leaves crown Deservedly your brow. Come to our home; 'Tis still as Numa's grove; and here, methinks, Some whispers reach us from the heavenly powers, I will interpret to you. Collatine, Give our young cousin welcome. Collatinus. To my house I turn as to a temple, and the doors Are open to all comers. Aruns. I shall bring Lucilia hither. Sextus. I shall come alone. Collatinus. Each as ye list. We part in amity? Aruns. Owning that you possess the perfect wife. Sextus. [Aside.] I love her; she is tempting me away From my dishonour, and her soft reproach Reminds me of my virtue. [Aloud.] You would make A hero of me? Lucretia. Or the gods forbid Fulfilment of the Delphic augury! Good-night, fair cousins. Aruns. Lady, take your rest. You have brought fame to Collatine. Collatinus. Farewell. [Exeunt princes. Lucretia. They're full of compliment. Ah me, 'tis strange That any can speak lightly, or make jest Of their deep, nuptial blisses, and not feel What awe we owe each other when we love. Collatinus. Rebuke me, dear; among the rioters I boasted of my wife. Lucretia. Dear Collatine, Shall we keep chastely each for other's joy Our bodies, and let common fame defile The holy intercourse of wedded love? That which a man can boast of is not his; He shares it with the vulgar. We possess What the All-ruling One holds secretly Shut in His hand,âour votive offerings, The things that we can never touch again, This hearth that is the gods', this dear, dear bond, That Juno blesses. Closer must I wind Round you my guardian arms. When we are thus Together, every care creeps from my heart. You'll play to me? Collatinus. And we will praise the gods. Scene IV. âRome, house of Brutus. Publia, Vindex feeding a lamp. Publia. They mock their father! Is it possible? Vindex. Why, he's dull outside; it vexes them. He walks to the forum, with his face working. He doesn't mind folk when he's anxious. All the same, it's not right he should be jeered at by his boys. Mistress, you must speak to them. They used to have a fear of their father. I've carried them up squalling; they grew quiet when he took them. Now they're all duty to his face; but to hear them laugh at him behind his back! Oh, it grates on the ear, that crisp, light laugh of a youngster, who does not know the meaning of things, never guesses where a groan comes from, and yet will jeer at the jerks and tremour of one who has a weight of cares on his shoulders. It's curious to watch Master; he doesn't seem like a freeman. He's under some great patron in his thoughts; for he never takes his pleasure as others do; it's must, must with him all day. I thought it was the scourge taught one the habit of saying must. Publia. They call him Brutus; he indeed affects A dulness; but his boys to mock at him! Vindex. Affects a dulness! Yes, yes; and it takes a man of sense to play the fool. Whatever he does, there is a must behind. There's no chance in his circumstance. If one has a heap of gold, the best way to keep envy off is to protest it's in the charge of a simpleton. Master might have been in bondage, he's learnt so many shifts. But I take it ill his own children should mis-judge him. It's just lightness. Publia. I'll speak to them. [Aside.] Ah me, beshrew my heart, But I, when I was young, oft laughed at him. Yet, when I laughed at him, 'twas to prevent The gravity of loving; for his moods Were each most precious to me, and his faults Right welcome, 'twas so sweet to pardon them. [Aloud.] I will reprove the boys, and smartly too. Vindex, go, fetch me these unduteous sons. You've cut me to the heart. Vindex. Tiberius is at the palace; he stalks in like a lord. And he doesn't learn there to think much of his parents. They're so masterful, these princes. But as for the younger one, he'll come, if you want him. He never refuses any one, and his mother!â [Goes to summon Titus. Publia. Oh, she just dotes on him! It's wonderful! In all his pranks there is an innocence. I never could rebuke him. [Enter Titus.] Titus. What a brow! Mother, you never fetch me but to scold. You trade on my sweet temper. Now, confess, You dare not trouble your Tiberius; Whilst I, who cannot suffer the least crease Of this white forehead, must endure the frown Of your displeasure. What's the new offence? Too boisterous at the banquet yester-eve? And idle? Well, when the great pedagogue Has turned his backâ Publia. Titus, you shall not thus Speak of your father; 'tis undutiful. You love him, and he bears with you, because, Like your mother, you are foolish, gay, and yet, Like her, most loving, Titus. Titus. Loving? Yes. Mother, he puts us to too great a strain, Forgetting that you gave us suck, and not A grisly wolf that reared up Romulus. He's no compassion. Publia. But you must be brave, Being his son. Titus. Whew! I am sensitive; I'm not made all of armour; underneath I have a woman's skin. I'm just like you. Tiberius can bear things; but I wish Father would not o'er-task us past our years In the way of our behaviour. We must have Carouses, ay, and liberty. Publia. To-night, 'Tis pity you're abroad, he will return; [You smile,âI say the priestess at my heart Foretells his entry] he will look around, And yet not ask for you. I dread that look. Titus. The age is past we clambered on his knee. Sweet mother, you grow dearer to your sons Each day; and father is so hard to reach. Farewell. [Kisses Publia and goes out hastily. Publia. [Aside.] I am not wifely in my love To dote upon the boy resembling me, And yet 'tis not my fault.âThis saucy slave Has quite unsettled me. He's meddlesome, And needs reproof. [Aloud.] Vindex, I will to rest, For there's no comfort in your company. You're full of evil omens. [Exit Publia. Vindex. Pretty lady! She's in the sulks, and doubtless to-morrow Vindex will be whipt. They look so tender, these ladies, but they never treat one fair. Master would not hurt a messenger for bringing ill news. Why, there's knocking. Two hours after supper-time, and our young masters under starlight! [He unbars the door. [Enter Brutus.] Brutus. Good Vindex, is the household gone to rest? Your mistress,âbut my sons? Vindex. They're both without. I fear me, master, they are something worse For all this liberty; they're much abroad; I dodge about and keep an eye on them. Brutus. You had no order; they will soon be men, And must be practised in self-government. Doubtless they are detained. You're not a spy; You are my trusted servant. Get you hence, And fetch your mistress hither, for my time Is short; I must, ere dawning, to the camp. [Exit Vindex. I dare not tell her all,âshe would be filled With a too great ambition. Lord of Rome! 'Twould take a woman's fancyâand the cost: These princes, who are kinsmen, torn from power; The slaves, who should be citizensâWhat change! What woe! for, when I strike, the Thunderer Takes not a truer aim. Ah me! ah me! Let the great Strangers see that right be done! They are not of a race that giveth suck; No urns are in their houses; they possess; They have no words for welcome and farewell; No tombs where frailty and transgression couch; They have not grown gray hairs. Sweetheart, she comes! [Re-enter Publia.] Publia. Dear, dear my lord, what kept you on the road? Brutus. The gods, my Publia. All, I trust, is well? Our sons are duteous? Publia. Who is lord of Rome? You come from Delphi. Love, disburthen straight, And ease my curiosity. All swear Our city's fortune hangs upon a kiss. Brutus. O Publia, you do not apprehend. Heaven is not wanton with its yea and nay; It lets men bear the issue of their deeds. Hear what befell. I lay down on the earth, In the grass, as it had been my mother's tombâ Publia. Then, Brutus, do you think the gods meant that, And after all my Dullard caught the sense Swifter than flying princes? It may be. Brutus. No, Publia; I had no thought at all Save one of wonder. 'Tis a miracle The Lord of eloquence should put my dumb Beast-mouth to music; yet a god himself Must stutter when he breaks the truth to men. Publia. But you will win great honour, if you speak. Silvius the oratorâ Brutus. A flaccid man, Of large, loose body, and ungirdled mind! Not so doth Heaven purpose. Dear, be still: There's much to bear. Publia. You do not tell me all. Brutus. I cannot, love. Think o'er my broken words, While you are weaving for us. May the gods Look kindly on our household peace. Farewell. [Exit. Scene V. âThe Camp before Ardea. Enter Sextus. Sextus. I never can defile her. Did she quake, Did my eye bring suspicion of her doom, There were high exultation in my act. But sink in her esteem, who finds the prince In the bottom of my nature! Can it be That women have no traffic in this sin, That they can take us by the yellow hair, As the goddess caught Achilles, and desire Simply our noblest manhood and the prayers Of our pure worship? Thus it seems with her: She has no craving to be satisfied, No lust to glut, no chafing appetite, No prying, vile ambition. She is formed, Through nature's cunning, unapproachable Save by religious love or foul surprise, That trembles at its hurry, knowing well A pause forbids attempt. I am resolved To visit her, and breathe her household air That tempers greedy passion; her fresh laugh Will ease my shameful pangs. I'll make her face A remedy, for when I meet her looks, I think of knighthood, princely faith, the bond Of kinship with her husband, all that keeps Her loveliness in trust from thriftless rape, And fraudulent spoliation. You are here! [Enter Aruns, hastily.] Aruns. With doubtful news. You must return to Rome. What think you of an emptied treasury For three imperfect parchments? Scarce returned From Delphi to allay my father's fears, Because a serpent lapped the altar food, I find him the meek victim of a maid, With something of a beggar in her mien, And yet, confound her! an authority That makes me cringe. Sextus. What are you jabbering of? We must not rule by augury, nor let A woman meddle with our destinies. Who brought these scrolls? Aruns. The girl who offered themâ Most wonderful, with tremulous, wild lips, And solemn eyes clear as the Alban lake,â Bore nine within her bosom's fold when first She stood before the king; a second time She sought him with six volumes in her hand, Their covers charred, and for these threatened leaves Claimed the unbated price. This morn, with face Wan as a shade, hasty, uneven step, And floating scroll half parted to the wind, She made fresh proffer of her heavenly wares. Her gesture was significant; we seized The fluttering, precious palm-leaves, and possess The third, the fragment of the holy books, For the grudged cost of the continuous nine. Sextus. A virgin sways the future of our race, Dominates Rome, erects her prophecies Above our power, takes gold and reverence! By heaven, my pride Will suffer not these women to control The fortunes of the state, or even crush The private bosom 'neath their government. I'll not be fooled, lose treasure and delight Through fear of their imperious chastity. I'll break their power, revenge this sibyl's deed, Hold to my will's design, nor abdicate One jot of manhood's despotism. Soon I'll be supreme. Aruns. What mean you? Sextus. To obtain The crown of womanhood. I'll see my sire As I ride homeward from Collatia. To-night I journey thither. Aruns. Nay, desist. Though you are younger, the king hath an awe Of your displeasure; you can urge him back To majesty. And for your private whim, I never knew you fail of your desire. Sextus. Nor will I. Aruns. Sextus, you are something rash To use your kinsman's rights for interview With fair Lucrece; though galling, I confess, Our cousin's triumph in his perfect spouse. The summer fruits yield not a cooler glow Than Lesbia's cheek. What need you in a wife Save colour, welcome, softness, and repose? All these are yours; the diligent Lucrece Would waken you with early morning thoughts. Take counsel: leave poor Collatine the guide He needsâa young Minerva for the fool. Sextus. A wager on my enterprise! Aruns. I hold No doubt of the issue; but, success attained, I see no vantage in the victory. Come with me to the temple. Sextus. Not to-day. To-morrow meet me at the Capitol Ere I return to camp . . . [Exit Aruns] my business done. O Alban sibyl, in the costly books, Heavy with auspices of endless note, Is my dominion celebrated, sung In ancient verses? On the very eve When Rome receives her written destiny From virgin hands, I shall inscribe my rule Deep in the honour of a Roman wife. I'll no more trifle, hesitate, refer Desire to conscience, stoop to self-raised fear, But like an unswayed monarch singly do The chief conception of my urgent mood. Lucretia, do you feel the coming storm? The sultriness of lust is in the air; It chokes me as it rises in foul fume From my embroilÃ¨d nature. I am sick Of this suppression, and the courtesy That I must feign. The lion shall be loosed To-night, and all the secrets of his rage Expounded to the prey,âthat gives me force. To-night! to-night! Meanwhile I'm circumspect. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âCollatia. A terrace-garden. Enter Lucretia through a myrtle bower. Lucretia. I know not if 'tis wholesome to escape From my dark chamber out into the sun. My tiny terrace-garden is my joy; And often to escape I make excuse The bees require my wisdom to direct Their honey-traffic, lest my busy maids Should charge their mistress with rank idleness. [Looking at the bees.] Would I were like them! for they toil and toil With a gay diligence, and never sigh. I spin all day when Collatine's at home; When he's away I come to think of him, For two brief moments, in the ilex-walk, Alone, amid the happy outside things. How it refreshes! [To Virgilia, who approaches.] Do you love the flowers, Virgilia? Virgilia. The roses, and those curling finger-leavesâ Lucretia. The acanthus-bed. I love the stately trees, Here under the great plane to lie and watch The tide o' the wind flow in among the boughs, And peep too at the sky without distress. Virgilia. I like best where the gardener clips the yew; He's shaping it into a funny beast, I think, a hog. Lucretia. He should not sculpture here, In my own shady walk. He's made the swine Snuffing a myrtle! Ah, my summer-house Of fragrant light, my bonnie bower of bloom, None shall look in on us. [Lies down in the myrtle bower. Virgilia. They're little stars. Lucretia. Then they watch those in heaven, and, methinks, A child should love them,âsteady, shining flowers; And the blood-berry,âone has dropt on me. Go, girl, our wreaths are drooping; bind me one Of any creeping cluster from the hedge. [Exit Virgilia. When my dear lord returns, I will be gay, Meanwhile I'll mourn for him in weeds and briars. My husband! How the moment I'm alone I must be speaking with him. [Drawing tablets from her bosom.] From my heart I'll draw these warmÃ¨d tablets, and set down My thousand little fondnesses and loves, That cannot reach him;âthere's no messenger. [Re-enter Virgilia.] Virgilia. Lady, one asks for you, a kinsman, andâ Lucretia. A kinsman! Nay, it is my Collatine; There is no other man in all the world That holds me in his thought. Thou foolish child, Dost thou not know thy master? Virgilia. [Aside.] It's a prince; I think he's proud. Lucretia. Oh look! my hair has strayed. He cannot suffer the least negligence. [Kissing Virgilia.] Virgilia, my little girl, O joy! I needs must kiss thee for the gaiety That springs up in my heart. Ye tablets, hence, My tongue shall now be my interpreter; Rather my lips with their dumb, kissing speech. Virgilia, My braids are duly set; how slow thou art! [Enter Sextus.] Let's to the house with welcome on our brows. Sextus. Sweet lady, an ambassador I come From your most worthy husband. You look faint And startled. Your good lord is well in health. Lucretia. I thought you were my lord; I must entreatâ Sextus. I would I were your lord! but, as a frost, Why should I chase these roses from your cheek, Who yet am kinsman, cousin? Ah, the glow Returns; it is the blush of bashfulness, Not that first radiant herald of delight, And journeying rapture, that made speed to me. I must return to Ardea with the news I have discomforted Lucrece, who came To tell her of her hero, and confirmâ Lucretia. There's no camp-gossip can confirm my faith In Tarquin's valour. Sextus. I am glad my name Is one with his; for, when you speak him fair, I'll take advantage of the happy chance To win the only favour that I prize, That of my honoured hostess. Lucretia. You mistake; You have a welcome of your own. My prince, Most royally you keep your word to spend Your passing leisure with us. [To Virgilia.] Go, prepare The guest-room; gather the fresh, ripening gourd, The early figs, and prettily bedeck Our simple dishes. [Exit Virgilia. The child's ignorant, Yet of sweet, courteous nature. And, forsooth, Her mistress lacks not hospitality, Though from its fair, initiatory rites An instant frightened. Let me take your hand. Sextus. [Detaining it.] Too dear a gift to part with. Lucretia. [Aside.] How his eyes Swarm on me! Doubtless it is thus at court, Where ladies must be flattered. [Aloud.] Do you look For further conflict on my cheeks? My fears Are wholly overcome. You've much to tell. Sextus. Much to report. I swear that Collatine Is a true Roman thus to leave his gods, His heaven, his wifeâ Lucretia. To gird a stubborn town. Rightly you rate his patience. Sextus. All his thoughts, And his affections centre on the state. Lucretia, little did my heart conceive He owned such paradise. Lucretia. He doth not brag, In the city, of Collatia, nor, at home, Of his fair chivalry. I burn to know, From warlike lips, how he becomes the camp, What hope he crowns, what honours flock to him, How he is served. This glowing afternoon You will unfold the story? I forget; You're heated from fast travel. Then we'll wait Till the small winds of evening slack the heat, And all your powers are fresh. Come in, my lord. [Exeunt. Scene II. âThe Camp before Ardea. Enter Lucretius. Lucretius. A restlessness is on me! As the sun Sinks down,âI know not why,âI hope my girl Is happy; as the clouds rise, that she's safe; These wenches! Ay, and mine is much alone Of late, and needing cheerful companyâ I'd like to chat with her. Now she is gone, I've found my mateless days again, albeit No youth to sweeten them. Well, well, I hope To-night she's blithe, and busy at her wheel. I'll set the watch. [Enter Brutus.] Brutus, your sons are grown. I saw them in the market-place last week; They bore their heads high. Brutus. As I came along I thought of them. Lucretius. Your Titus has a gait Too careless for his years; Tiberius An insolent demeanour; 'mid the group Of anxious faces these young citizens Flaunted their new attire. Brutus. I fear they know But little of the gravity that breathes In the sweet verses of the oracle Through which life speaks to youth. A father's part Is somewhat an interpreter's. Lucretius. My child Was rather priestess to my daily life, Than I her seer. Brutus, I thought of her Soon as I saw 'twas sunset on the tents. Brutus. Your hand! My thoughts were also fatherly. Lucretius. Come, we must find a soldier, who can fill Prince Sextus' place. He's ridden towards the north, Starting some hours ago. Here come the workers, Who dig the mines beneath the eastern wall. Brutus. Stupid they tramp on, like o'erdriven herds, But worse tire on their faces. [Aside.] And of these The Dullard may be the Deliverer! [Exeunt. Scene III. âThe house of Collatinus. Sextus sitting alone. After an interval, Lucretia enters, with tablets in her hand. Sextus. Lucretia, I must very early rise To-morrow for the camp, ere any stir. Most cruelly you've left me to myself Since supper-time. Remember, I am come To learn the secret of your happiness. Lucretia. Have you no friends, my prince, among your thoughts, That thus you languish? What! no counsellors, No grave instructors of a charmed discourse, Whom you can summon to your solitude? I, in my quiet hours, have learned to cull My meditations from a motley rout Of cravings, importunities, and fears; And the few bosom-thoughts I entertain, O'er-grateful for my hospitality, Come to my side, unsought, when I am sick, Sullen, or dull, and nurse me to content. Sextus. What thoughts, Lucretia? Lucretia. Oh, of simple things. How we can bless each other, what deep hopes The gods build in our people. I can see The temple rising on the Capitol, By the Sabines' holy places. On the throne Sacred to youth Rome was forbid to build; Her deity May not be overborne; high Jupiter Respects her altars. It is wonderful To think Juventas should remain eterne In majesty, and, by her votaries, Stablish the city, and o'ercome the world. Doth it not thrill your heart, Tarquinius? Sextus. Youth is a power,âah! Lucrece, you divine,â A tyranny hoar Jupiter reveres, Nor in her precincts dares define the site Of his triumphant rule. Youth shall prevail, When pontifex and silent vestal cease Their journey up the steep. Lucretia. I rather hold It means religion would not violate Nature's fair bounds, but rear her holy walls Beside them neighbourly, nor aught transgress, Save by intrusion of her solemn shade. But, sooth, my cousin, I do owe excuse For my withdrawal. The whole afternoon You kept me a spelled listener on your lips, And, for requital, won no counter tales Of emulous enchantment; for my heart Was gag upon my tongue. Some broken words I have set down in secret to my lord, And now may best commend your eloquence By making you the convoy of my love. [Presenting the tablets. Bear these to Collatine. This genial hour, Tell your dear camp-mate, hath revived my soul. Thanks for your courteous journey, and farewell. Sextus. Good-night, fair cousin. In my bosom these. [Taking the tablets. There rest the ivory scriptures; but, your hand,â A moment's gift; we're parting. You will dream To-night of Sextus, and his colloquy? Lucretia. In simple frankness, no; my constant dream Is of the camp. I have a faithful fancy, and can trust The flock of my unguarded thoughts to feed Secure, as they were folded by the tent Of Collatinus. Fare you well, my lord. [Exit. Sextus. Farewell, farewell; from my dear worship's gaze She's ravished;âI shall look on her no more, No more revere her, feel her happy voice Sway my insurgent thoughts no more. [Pressing the tablets.] How cold Her words! Oh, she is warm, enchanting, fond, And soon to be enjoyed. She shall repay Each pang she cost me, in my wanton hour, Or death will ravage me. It is the end, The purpose of these women; to deny Is for the plighted vestal with her dread Of the sealed chamber, and the waning lamp In the entrails of the Capitol. I'll tear [Taking out the tablets] Now from her breast its secrets. Let us see How fared she ere she came 'neath Sextus' rule. [Reads.] One golden hour with Tarquin have I sped: Ay, and another shall be thine. Lucrece, If I may be thy lover, we'll not speak, Strive, nor reproach, but, with enwinding arms, Mingle our silent passions in an act. Let me read further. O my love, come quick, For I grow faint to hear my soldier's praise, And give him no reward. It is enough. I will enact her Collatine, and reap The pleasure he commands. The house grows dead. I'll to my chamber. [Stumbling.] She has left her lute; I've crushed it, but no matter. She'll not need To sing again. She'll weep and hold her peace. [Exit. Scene IV. âPassage leading to Lucretia's room. Enter Sextus stealthily. Sextus. Say, shall I rouse her as a conqueror, And teach how women, in beleaguered towns, Must hurry to the door when soldiers knock? Not so; my jealousy hath finer sense. From Collatine I'll ravish her, from dream Of his close, nuptial kiss. Is she asleep? [Enter Virgilia, closing Lucretia's door.] I'll ask the child. Virgilia, what ho! Hast sung thy mistress to her rest? Some word I would have spoken. Virgilia. Sir, she does not sleep, But stays awake most happy; and the moon Lies right across her; though her eyes are wide, I scarce should dare to go to her again. She's like a statue. Sextus. But she'll rest anon. Tread softly; bring me word she's fast asleep, And I'll determine further. [Exit Virgilia. What! the moon! I'll pause till Dian's watch be passed, and take The guard at early morning. I will put The offer to her of a murdered slave For bed-fellow at Collatine's return, Or absolute compliance to my will, And the conditionâsecresy. Suppose She risk her lord's displeasure to die chaste;â I'll stab her to the heart, and violate Simply her reputation. She shall choose, Consent to all: 'twixt infamy and rape I'll learn the odds. She has a voice that creeps Like a warm dove to one's bosom; but all's weighed, No clamour, no entreaty,âthe bare termsâ Death, or surrender! [Re-enter Virgilia.] Virgilia. It had grown quite dark: I heard the breathâ Sextus. Begone! [Exit Virgilia.] It is the hour. Whom shall I call, what gods shall I invoke, What ancestor will multiply my powers Till I grow superhuman? Tullia, Give me thy tiger-heart, that I may drive The steeds of my ambition past the spot They rear at in recoil! Let me transgress The bounds that circumscribe humanity, And grow indefinite and huge in crime! My mother, comeâimperialâto my aid, Gibe me with cowardice:ââWhat, Lord of Rome! And shudder at a woman's chastity?â Thou know'st the trick; it spurred me as a boy.â Why, now 'tis dark,âI cannot feel the door. [Sextus passes in the early light, looking back at the door of Lucretia's chamber.] I need not lock it; there's no treasure there, No chastity, no secret. All her maids Lie quiet. Will she rise and bid them spin, And bear the heavy burthen of the day? I heard some early notes of singing birds, And broke away from her. She's lying dumb, And murdered, murdered at the heart. O Death, Take her to thy corruption,âshe is vile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âLucretia's bed-chamber. Lucretia. I think it is the light, and, if I watch, My senses will return. I know the sun Fell in a streak so on the little nook Where I piled up my needlework: it's thereâ I'm in a stupor; for I do not mind. I used to be so joyous at the sight Of the small fleecy wraps. It's gone from me; Tarquin hath ravished all. Oh, I could sink Inward to Lethe: but I must not sleep, There must be no more negligence. Some words I had to write. [Motions to summon Virgilia.] I will not rouse the child, She'd stare at me. I must bear well in mind Where I belong. By chance I learnt the name, Though I ne'er uttered it for modesty. I amâ The thing, my body is a brothel-house. [Taking tablets.] Here are the ivory slips. What shall I write? I cannot feel. I will put on my gown, And try to rouse myself. [Turns from it shuddering.] Lucretia's . . . I Am Tarquin's . . . What the wife Of Collatine hath worn is not for me. Hang there. . . . I must be liveried In death. [Puts on black raiment.] Alack, how cold they lie on me, These mourning clothes! [Writes silently.] I can unfold it now. [Summons, and despatches the messenger. Six hours! He cannot come to me ere noon. How shall I bar my spirit from the past? This falchion I will lay beside its sheath, [Hiding the knife in her bosom. And on the slaughter of mine enemy Bend my concentred will. The time will pass. Scene II. âHigh ground before Ardea; the besieging army in sight. Enter Sextus: he looks back toward Rome. Sextus. What holds me from the town? I'd business there, And made straight for the gates; it was the hour Of opening, and I stood and watched them swing, Yet could not stir a foot. Doubtless success Hath somewhat weakened me; the branching road Hath borne me hither, and I do not doubt War's noisy traffic will best block my ears From certain sounds the wind bears after me In harassing pursuit. Why must I pause To watch the sun rise? On Collatia's roofs He glistens; the young doves were cooing low, In the first light, when I set out for Rome. What purple clouds beset the Capitol! The temple's dark; but on the lower ground, The Regia flares: 'twill be a stormy day; I'll back to drill and discipline; two hours Of the accustomed will recover me. [Enter Brutus.] There's Brutusâwell, that's better, in the sun, Than to encounter Collatine. [Observing Brutus.] He loves To mutter to himself. Brutus. [Climbing the hill.] There is a way Of life, a good for men, a shapely world, Though all is black confusion. [He gains the summit, and sees the city lying in sunlight.] God of day, Thou hold'st the city, all her seven hills Crowd for thy golden kiss! Apollo, rule My Rome; thou hast the great assuaging art Of eloquence; I, in my blurting rage, Should move men to derision. 'Tis my blood Revolts; that palace flaunting to the skyâ About its base the city strews her dead, It is unclean, it savours of offence. Thou punishest, thine arrows speed to hell,â Send forth thy darts; for now, if heaven fail, By crime, contagious wrath, conspiracy, Must come the retribution. [Observing Sextus.] Back to camp! Surveying Ardea from this vantage-ground, You counsel an assault? Sextus. Assuredly. The town will yield, our engines at her walls. We have been slack, and compassed her without The press of resolution. Let her feel Our will is in her overthrow, she'll ope Her gates, and tremble. Think you there is aught I could attempt, and fail in? Brutus. I am dull. At Gabii you found guile answer best, Who now are all for force,âat Gabii. I cannot give advice; my head's a field On which contending armies intermix; I cannot clear a space for policy. Sextus. 'Tis well, my cousin, that you keep a fool. To be a prince, Warm, lustful, arrogant, without respect Of prejudice or person, is to learn There's no opposing virtue in the world. One need not sweat at one's iniquity; All's slab to one's desire. [Collatinus approaches. Brutus. There's Collatine! Sextus. Your nearest friend. [Aside, as he retires.] Fools love such intercourse; They trust each other. [Glancing at Collatinus.] Now, for one quick breath, I triumph; you at least are dispossessed, And I am quit of envy. Everything Is common and unclean. From Lucrece' couch Where shall I go? 'Twas folly to survive! [Exit Sextus. Brutus. Welcome, my Collatine! How went the wage? [Aside.] Yet am I scarcely curious. Collatinus. She won! Proud Sextus fastened on her his great eyes, In a very stare of wonder. The young prince Hath seldom looked upon true modesty. Brutus. And must not; 'tis a sight too reverend For one so impious. Collatinus. Brutus, there you err; Our cousin Tarquin hath an open soul, Boyish, and quickly moved. Soon as he saw Lucrece, he quite forgot his angry fit, And prayed to visit us. Methinks, e'en now He lodges at Collatia. Brutus. Then he left At very early dawn; for on the hill We talked together, as you climbed to us; And in the ruddy sunlight he grew pale, As you approached. Collatinus. A shyness, it is true, I've noted in him. Brutus. It were natural He should have brought you tidings of your home. I would not have you trust its sacred walls To foreign soldiership. Take holiday; And give Lucretia the most blest surprise, And comfort of your presence. Go alone. The dew of your first bridal privacy Enter, and balm your soul! Our dusty camp Hath something harmed you. [A messenger enters, with letter. Collatinus. Here's a messenger! Brutus, you come fresh from the oracle. Interpret this. Brutus. [Reading.] Rome harbours traitors;âit hath reached my ears; Great glory shall you have delivering her, Through my betrayal, from her enemies. Speed with my father, and two trusty friends; Brutus is worthy of thy faith. Collatinus. You've caught The stare of the fixed priestess. Brutus. She's betrayed. Collatinus. Nay, Dullard, she betrays Rome's enemies. Brutus. We will avenge her. Collatinus. She shall have great fame. Rome harbours traitors; she discovers this; And saves her city: come! Brutus. Go, seek her father. Yonder is his tent. [Exit Collatinus. How it breaks on me! I can bear it all. Ye gods, re-mark the city's boundaries; Fling in my nature's ditch the holy fruits Of man's religion, furrow deep in me The piercing share that shall define the wall Exiling tyranny. [Re-enter Collatinus, with Lucretius.] To-day are laid, Lucrece, the deep foundations of thy Rome. Thou'lt give thy blood? Her father,âCollatine,â (Aloud.) Friends, are you ready? Do not start in haste. [Exeunt. Scene III. âA room in Collatinus' house. Enter Lucretia, flowers in her hand. Lucretia. I've roamed the garden; all the house is stillâ I sent the girls to wash beside the stream; We'll have all clean ere eventide. I plucked A branch of myrtle; it is all for him I suffered it. I could not lie stone dead, And leave false Sextus to pollute his ear. Besides, I had not looked on him my last: Oh, how I love him! I have said farewell To all our tender moments in the past; And kissed his wedding-gifts, and laid them by. The time has quickly sped; for I am full Of the great honour I shall bring to him. Had I died stainless, he had crept about Disgraced and fearful; now Lucretia's spouse Shall have a reverend name, and Roman wives Rate by my deed the measure of my love. It must be soon. [She looks out.] They're coming up the hill. He lags behind. I'll run and comfort him; For never, never was I more his wife. I cannot die. Gods, he is looking up, And I back in my guilt . . . Fair human law Awards the sentence: in his righteous sight The body, yielded to base Tarquin's lust, Be scourged by blushing record of its crime To faintness, and then smitten by the knife. Can I not now be executioner? [Enter Collatinus, Brutus, Lucretius, and Publius; they all remain speechless.] My father, thou hast never had a son To bear thine honour to the battle-field; To me, thy trembling daughter, thou didst tell Stories of heroes, and my woman's heart Hath caught the martial touch. I call to arms; Those swords must all be bloody ere we part. Give me your blessing; let me feel your hand. [She stretches her hands to her father. Lucretius. My child, speak to us. I command you, speak! Publius. It is some private wrong; she cannot force Her craven words to her will's summoning. Brutus. She's deadly hurt; speak to her, Collatine, Before it is too late. Collatinus. What ails thee? Dear, If thou name not the traitor, Rome is wronged, And I robbed of my fame. Lucretia. [Wildly.] Tarquinius . . . Oh, I mistake . . . My husband, hadst thou heard, By strongest proof, had one brought word to thee, That he had found me lying with a slave And slaughtered us, thou hadst believed this thing, And lived dishonoured of thy countrymen, Loathing thyself,âbelieved this? Collatinus. Of my wife? As I should credit Roman infamy From a bribed slave. [Lucretia swoons: they gather round her.] Let's scrutinize her brow. She's guilty. [To Lucretius.] . . . There, look to't, she is your child. [He thrusts Lucretia from him; her body falls at her father's feet. Brutus. Peace! patience! She will revive; see, her scathed father stands Mustering an army of his ancient loves To gather round him, and to strike for her. [To Lucretius.] Spurius Lucretius, blush not at your name; This lady does it honour. Oh believe, And give her comfort, that her modesty Yield not its life in travail of the words That are its lawful issue. [Lucretia revives.] We attend. Lucretius. Lucretia, we are armed. Where is't to strike? Lucretia. Father! [She kisses him and stands erect.] Where is he? [Seeing Collatine.] Thou, O my wrecked love, Take heart; believe, I did but swoon for joy That thou wouldst ever hold Lucretia chaste; And for remorse that I, mistrusting thee, Have borne the manners of unholy lust In this my bodyâthy dear temple, spoilt For any sacred use. I will be briefâ . . . In the night's inmost close A creeping creature came to me, and swore To make my lord an obloquy to Rome. . . . He waited answer at my beating heart With his compressing sword. . . . Alack! I live. Collatinus. [Unsheathing his sword.] He livesâthe name? [They all unsheath. Lucretia. Swear to me, every one, You will avenge me. All. We all take the oath. Lucretia. On Sextus; you are solemnly enrolled. [They turn to the door. A moment:âtell me, for my mind misgives, What is the quality of my offence? Can I be ever cleared, though you return With reeking blades? Lucretius. My child, we will revenge. You're safe. Brutus. We honour you. Publius. Lady, your woes You've writ on Roman hearts, they there are graved Eternally. Lucretia. My husband, you are dumb. [Aside.] A widowed face, but I, like Hercules, Will fetch his bride back to him from the dead. [Aloud.] I'm glad you cannot so forget Lucrece. One word more: I have told you all my crime; There is no lurking witness in my heart Not heaved up to my tongue, save this resolveâ [She feels for the knife. Which, when 'tis done, I will bequeath to you, The one thing worthy of you from your wife. [Turns to the others.] Now, Romans, to your work; my sword be first To drink the expiation of my guilt. [She stabs herself, and falls dead at Collatine's feet. Lucretius. Why, here's a Roman death! And the young lass I scarce would give a blessing to; the nurse Swore she would breed strong boysâa healthy babe. Lucretiaâbut I reared her tenderly, Had well-nigh made her vestal, for she seemed Too heavenly To learn her mortal use. . . . Thou liest there Full of the secrets of a prince's lust, The knowledge of a harlot 'neath the clasps Of that pale parchment, and thou art not marred: I kiss thee, I . . . Collatinus. Leave meâO gods!âmy wife. Lucretius. You spurned her; she is Tarquin's sated lust To you; I have begotten her,âher soul Shines crystalline in its virginity. [Turning to Brutus and Publius.] Mine honourable friends, I charge you, join me to avenge my child, If you do hold her flawless; let no hand Be raised for her that doth esteem her vile; She's of my blood; I will not suffer it. Brutus. I draw the sword. [Taking the weapon from Lucretia's breast.] Let's swear a bloody oath That none hereafter shall be king in Rome. Give me your blades. [They dip them in Lucretia's blood. We all will lift her up. Cover her, Collatine; her funeral We'll talk of in the forum. You are dumb; For me, I can speak plain. O Publius, Speech hath a holy use. Ye all shall hear My praises of my kinswoman; attend. [Exeunt, bearing Lucretia's body. Scene IV. âRome. The Forum. Enter Brutus, Lucretius, Publius, and Collatinus, carrying Lucretia's body: Citizens. 1st Citizen. Up, up! there is a march, and many folk Are pouring in. 2nd Citizen. It matters not to me. They bring no food, they will not ease our toil, And pay us for our labour. There's no hope That any feet can bear. 1st Citizen. From every house The neighbours join the crowd. 2nd Citizen. It is the king. Ardea is ta'en: they shout. 1st Citizen. Nay; see what comes! Who is this lady with the golden brows? Her blood upon her breast, in sable dress, A corpse and yet a mourner? She is borne By Brutus, Publius, and other two Whose names I know not. 3rd Citizen. From Collatia They carried her this morning, and they shout, No kings, no Tarquins. 1st Citizen. Flavius, no kings! You heard it? Let us out and listen. There! Citizens of Collatia. No kings, no Tarquins! 1st Citizen. Heigh! the Dullard's face Glows like new-minted coin. 2nd Citizen. They put her down. 1st Citizen. [Pointing to Brutus.] He grasps a knife, as Roman Jupiter The lightning of his rule. 2nd Citizen. He speaks, he speaks! The dumb becomes an orator. Brutus. You all Know me a man of silence: it is well Only a tongue unused to state discourse, Whose speech is as a virgin to affairs Of common interchange and festal cheer, Could speak of that which I am bold to say. My mute division from the public voice Hath been the preparation for this hour. Romans, hard by is Vesta's honoured shrine; If man dared mould the goddess of the hearth, Here is her statue [uncovering Lucretia], fearful, intimate, Provoking holy thoughts. I cannot leave This spotless witness to proclaim the truth; Her spirit spreads lustration o'er the sin That hath polluted her: she is defiled. 3rd Citizen. A monstrous, vile assault! 1st Citizen. Who did the deed? Brutus. A princeâa ruler, one Who, lawless in his blood, would bind the state To the mere statutes of his tyrant will. Lucretius. Stay!âlet me give her name. All. Old man, declare! Lucretius. I'm Spurius Lucretius, and her name Lucretia. Brutus. HisâSextus Tarquinius. Collatinus. He lives. All. He dies. [Tumult among the citizens. Brutus. Pause, Romans; think not to avenge this wrong With ignorant impetuosity; They spread the targe of purpose o'er their wrath Who take the field for retribution. Think! Death's syllables fall slow. Ye must attend Lucretia's pleasure. Tarquin swore to spread Report that he had found her with a slave, And slain her: this to Collatine, her spouse, To Spurius Lucretius, her great sire, To Rome, her countrymen: the girlish wife, In pity of our manhood's tarnished brows, Bore for an hour the harlot's burning name Then poured her blood upon it, that henceforth Death and dishonour be one word in Rome. 1st Citizen. O noble lady, you have made your land A glory to the peoples! Brutus. While it bows To Tarquin's race, and yields its sacred soil To impress of his lustful tyranny? All. We will destroy the brood. 3rd Citizen. His cursÃ¨d feet Shall never cross the borders of the state. All. Never! On him, his father, and his race, We will pronounce perpetual banishment. Brutus. We will. Who rule in wickedness and force Are anarchy's own offspring in disguise Of sacred government. The son of Mars Who drew these walls, Quirinus, in his rule, Wielded the dual might of law and arms. Dark with the wrath of heaven were the years Of Tullus, disobedient to the rites And ceremonial by Numa learnt From heavenly Egeria. The code Of Servius in murder was annulled By the proud father of this ravisher. 1st Citizen. We will avenge. Brutus. We will enforce the doom Of princes who are malefactors. Speak Calmly, Quirites, the just punishment. All. Exile for ever. Brutus. Let the gates be closed. Spurius Lucretius, to your charge I leave Our people's city. All. You shall govern us; Brutus is Lord of Rome! Brutus. AccursÃ¨d speech. There shall be no more tyrants: we will seek The camp; the king already speeds to Rome; I will avoid him on the route: meanwhile Defy him from the city's fast-barred gates. With Ardea's soldiers I will straight return, And, pressing on his rear, force him to flee Or perish. Then, we on the Field of Mars, Will gather: ye shall choose your magistrates, Men who as brothers shall protect the state, Give you their blood on battle-field, in peace Their serviceable wisdom. Publius. We will choose Great Brutus for our leader; he himself Shall find a mate. Brutus. Then I choose Collatine With me to bear imperial command, Till Tarquin be expelled. 1st Citizen. Ye both shall rule. 2nd Citizen. I like not Collatinus;âhe is mum And cold. But Brutusâ 1st Citizen. You could lay the crown On his wide brow,âhe'd never notice it. We must not show reluctance at his choice. Hail, Lucius Brutus, noble Collatine, Our Rome's deliverers. [A shout. Collatinus. I would bespeak Some post of danger. Brutus. From Lucretia's side You stir not: you are lawful treasurer Of our new city's wealth. With younger Rome, I'll march to Ardea. Publius. We will follow him. Collatinus. Ye who are husbands and are fathers stay For the defence. Elder Citizens. We'll gird the Capitol, And force them from the walls. Brutus. Each to his rule. [To the young men.] You must not look again upon that face [pointing to Lucretia] Till you are freemen. [Exit, with band of young Romans. 2nd Citizen. I am faint, my heart Swells,âtake me to my hovel, to my wife; Send out the children, let them hear the word, Freemen,âO joy! I'm dying. [He falls. Elder Citizens. Lady, hail! Lucretius. [To Collatinus.] You hear the shout; you shudder; here in sight Of these most reverend elders, you shall clear My child of blame, or shall declare her guilt. Plain words: no reservation. Collatinus. She is clean Now she is dead: I spurned her to your face Before the expiation. Lucretius. Son, to you I leave the corpse: to you, fair citizens, My daughter's memory. You've reared no maid Is like to prove her equal. These the breasts To suckle freedom! Elders. We will honour her For ever, and elect her noble spouse Our city's youngest ruler. Lucretius. Man the gates. [Collatinus silently salutes the elders: exeunt, Lucretius leading them.] Collatinus. My wife: now I can cover thee; thou'st served The vulgar purpose. I have seen thee borne A trophy to the people. It was dark, The hour of thy dishonour, and thy hand Plucked down death's seamless curtain for its pall. Here, in the forum, in the glaring crowd, I've borne the profanation of our love. There is no privacy Longer between us. Lucrece, no man's lust Could put thee to the poise of agony I've suffered tongueless from the mouths of men. Thou canst be cleansed;âdeath hath a bleaching ground For crimes o' the dye that stain thee. I am vile Past remedy. [Rising.] That in her very heart She thought I could have doubted her! 'Twas rash To praise her so,âshe lived for good report; [Enter a train of matrons.] Doubtless she will have fame. A noble train Of matrons comes to wash and garland her. I cannot meet them. [Retires. The matrons gather round Lucretia: a young Roman wife unveils her. Young Roman Wife. Claudia, she is young! Claudia. She should have been a mother. Elder Matron. She's a wife. I have borne many sons, and testify No stirring of my first-born in the womb, No joy in the man-child who proves his blood, Can bear comparison with nuptial bliss. Cleave to your spouses, ye young, wedded girls; Grow wise to be their counsellors; fulfil Still higher office 'neath their sovereignty As years increase; then, if their rule is mocked, Perish proclaiming it. This sacred bride, Our Juno's youngest nursling, shall be decked As fair as for her spousals: and for aye Rome's sweetest-natured women bear her name. Touch her devoutly. Claudia. It is wonderful How she could kill herself. Young Roman Wife. Nay, Claudia, I think I could. Claudia. Now you have seen her face. [Exeunt the matrons, bearing the body of Lucretia. Scene V. âA desolate part of the Campagna. Enter Sextus and Nobles. Sextus. I scarcely hear your voices in the blast; Nearer, good friends, or I must fulminate To this unpeopled plain my deep design. My father is undone; as outcasts, we Endure the weather, and the infamy Of vanquished arms. Attend me!âgo to Rome, And with slack knee and pliant countenance, Entreat permission to remove the goods And treasure of the king. There'll be delay: Use it to rouse the loyal; steal within The homes where licence flaunted 'neath our rule; Then Rome is ours. Oh, vengeance! Swift, to horse! Nobles. 'Twere well we built a fire and dried our robes, Ere hurling to the city. Sextus. Ride to-night, Ride fresh in your discomfiture; recall How for my ends I went to Gabii, The traitor city, with blood-dripping back, And glory so impaired; my enemies, Indignant at my father's cruelty, Which thus, I swore, deformed me, took me in As guest, then leader: easy as the lash Of a light wand that, lifted carelessly, Sunders the spurting poppy-heads, I clove Their nobles' skulls. Nobles. No more: we're on our way, And shall prepare your entry. [Exeunt, riding swiftly. Sextus. Foul disgrace! She whom I forced hath done it; I'm o'erthrown By her who lay subjected to my will; I'm ravished of my honour and my kingdom, Defamed in Roman annals for all time. She even rules my vision, for at night She sits beside my bed, and guides a wheelâ Methinks it is my destiny she spins Before my giddy eyesâand as she works She sings; her voice is like a brook that wails In a dark valley. When the dawn awakes, Pale, weak, and shuddering as if by night Insulted, then she gives one fearful cry, And, pointing to the red scar on her breast, Leaves me more abject, weary, desperate, Than she herself, when I stole out from her That hour. I thought my knife so moved her fear She'd never tamper with a biting blade. But I will lay her spectre by the press Of action; rouse the neighbouring tribes to pour Converging, irrepressible, on Rome. Will the wrecked creature haunt me when I house Once more upon the Capitol, above The palpitating city? All my sports Shall be blood-dashed; these crowned republicans Shall draw my chariot, and be as slaves Imbruted for my pleasure. In the art Of degradation I will plant my fame, Till the pale spirit quivering retire, And I sleep dreamless, or revolve new schemes Of rapine, unfatigued. Discrowning night Of lustful triumph, how I curse thy shade! [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. âRome. Court of Brutus' house. Enter Publia, Titus, and Tiberius. Tiberius. Republic! May it perish! Titus. Heigh-ho! Pleasure Is killed, no dances, feasts, and laughing pomp. Publia. And so you hang about my huswifery, Till I am spoiled for duty with my girls; The slaves are listless with perpetual calls From harassed toil, the very dogs enraged With teazing by the fountain, where you lie And borrow its lament. Titus. Our friends are gone; Gay banquets are no more. Tiberius. I'd rather drowse In stalest privacy than mix my rank With farmers and mechanics. Titus. Perish birth, High place, and honour, so that revelry Once more would tune her instruments, and lift Her leisure-killing cups. Publia. Hush! [Enter Brutus.] Brutus. None at work, No, nor at play. Go forth to bath or games, But hang not round this idle fount. Tiberius. 'Tis hot. Brutus. To fainting girls. Publia. The sun is high. Brutus. Nay, nay. No weak excuse. Titus, your sprawling limbs Shame Roman discipline. Put by my scrolls. [Exeunt Titus and Tiberius. Brutus. Wife, I am dazed. Publia. You sought the public voice, None made you foe of kings, and orator. You were a man so private. Brutus. Now my thoughts Are coins in every hand, and reticence Is plundered. The republic!âin our home, Sweet wife, we must retain our royalties, Or piety will wane. Is Titus well? I miss his laugh. Good wife, be less aghast,â I may misread in the strange mood that flows From alterationâthere's a sullen frown I've noted in Tiberius. Is that The fancy of my strangeness? Publia. Oh, you dream. Yet is he dull and wearied, for he kept Much company with the old, royal house, And finds the times are changed, as you confess. [Enter Vindex.] Vindex. Master, they call you to the senate. The old king sends for his goods that lie in the city. They debate whether the chattels and raiment shall be yielded to the messengers. Brutus. Tell them I come. And fetch my sons. Exit Vindex. Publia. They are good children. Brutus. Wife, You need not hold my arm. Publia. Youth's golden hours Are PhÅbus' wilful horses, and they keep The paces of his pleasure. Be not stern With Titus; he is young. Brutus. Think, Publia; Is it not piteous to see our youth Like waxen figures melting in the sun? And for the royal houseâdear wife, the blood Rome boasts pours through the fiery veins of Mars That consanguinity is proved in arms. Princes may languish, but our citizens Inherit duties. Publia. Gently deal rebuke. [Exit. Brutus. A magistrate, chief governor!âand all My nature fashioned votive to express The perilous ambitions and desires Of the dull, weary, struggling multitude. I would have been a sacred messenger, Chosen from its very ranks. I feel its wrongs, Its wantonness, its imbecility, The deep fidelity of its despair, Even to my inmost blood-drop. And my place Is with authority; the lictors stand About me. I must deal with punishment, Repression, and the lips I thought were loosed For freedom's service, now must only move To the slow terms of law. The senators Confirm me in my powers, and sever me From the common people. Yet the time will come They shall have heralds of their own. Meanwhile I am made absolute o'er life and death; I legislate, command. Ye holy gods, Arraign me if I rule in insolence, With arbitrary choice. Come hither, sons! [Re-enter Titus and Tiberius.] Your mother tells me that your days are changed; You miss your wonted company,âthe hours Misspent with haughty princes, and the youth Who scorn the laws that, in the ilex-grove, The Muse, religious-voiced, to Numa taught, The later mandates Servius decreed, And that great natural awe that guards the heart From brutish degradation. Tiberius. Needless fear! I miss them not the least. Titus. Oh, but I do! And father, who can chat with empty air, Or with the fountain keep good fellowship? For one complains, the other answers not. Brutus. Better discourse with the god-haunted airs, Or the cool genius stirring in the well, Than deal with godless tyrants. Give your minds Noble companionship. Have you no friends, That you with Vindex must be closeted; No thoughts to ripen into enterprise; No hallowed sighs that need interpreting From youth's own augurs? Youth with youth is quick At divination of the holy things That make mysterious passage through its sky. Take counsel with your fellows; they I trust, Are honourable youths? Tiberius. Sir, we attend Your admonition. Titus. Gods, we must be grave! Brutus. Nay, Titus, nay. You have your mother's brows, Candid and blithe: do not suppress yourself. Now tyranny is dead, there is no need Of any slavish habit, and to feign Is not a Roman art. Farewell, and guard Your breasts from discontent. [Exit. Tiberius. I'll never learn That lesson under consuls. Titus. Sport is killed. Here comes our moody uncle. [Enter an Aquilius.] Aquilius. Listen, boys, I may not use my voice except to breathe A whisper of deliverance. The king Hath sent to claim his goods; the deputies, Our kinsmen, lodge with us, and share our board, Filling our ears with hope. A band of friends To monarchy will meet this very hour, In a dim chamber of our palace. There I'll take you, for you love the courtly days And pleasures that are banished. Tiberius. Titus, come. We shall be princes, if we bring the crown Back to our monarch's brow. Titus. Throw wide the gates, And feasts, pomp, gaieties, and majesty Will enter like the golden age. We come. [Exeunt. Scene II. âOutside the Senate. Enter Publius and Vindex. Vindex. Thus it befell. My mistress sent me to her brother's house to look for the young masters. I'm familiar there, and I ran from chamber to chamber. Winded and shaking, I stoppedâI'm old now, and my breath goes. It was all empty in the great hall; but just in the recess, where the parchments lie by, there were feet, and whispering. I listened; it's a habit I've got, when folk drop their voices, to make up to them. I'd not been behind the black chest for a moment, before I heard such words! I peeped out; there were only seven men, butâoh!âclose to me, so that his robe brushed my face, was Titus, and he laughed. It went through meâ and a cup passing round; he would not drink, I noted that, though he jested; Tiberius took it.âIt was slave's blood, but the vileness was in their hearts. I just hid myself in the dark, and trembled. There was an oath, and the scratch of writing. When I looked out again, they were gone. Publius. Titus, Tiberiusâhis very sons! Vindex. I lay dazed and groaning. Then a hurry fell on me. I sprang to my feet. The master, so noble, so betrayed, the city, the happy folk! I thought of the comely boys, and was torn like a lion's prey. I knew not what to do; I wept and fled. In the street the people were singing, and I reached your door. Publius. No time to lose! Vindex. But the master!âwhat will he do? I'm a wine-pourer;âbut I cannot pour out the blood of their young lives. It's no business of mine. Oh, it's murderous! See, he comes . . . and he's smiling. [Senators pass. [Enter Brutus, attended by Lictors.] Brutus. [To Senator.] Greatly I rejoice That in this matter justice hath been done, And the king's wealth restored. Senator. You won the grace. [They part. Publius. He darkens as he sees us. Vindex, speak! Vindex. My tongue's cut to the rootsâI've told you allâI can't remember. Publius. Slave, no skulking back. [Holds Vindex. Brutus. What ails you? Danger to the state, a foe? Publius. Both. Brutus. From what quarter? Publius. Yours. Brutus. I dwell against The northern wall. Etruscans? Publius. In your home The danger hides. Brutus. Vindex, be brief, my man. What does he mean? Vindex. Master, forgive me, master! Brutus. Not my old slave a traitor! 'Tis not so. Vindex. I am a traitor, not to you, my dearest lord; not to the city; but, forgive me, forgive me, I'm betraying the young masters. Brutus. Titus, Tiberius? 'Tis womanish So long to speak of nothing. I demand What brings you here. Publius. They plot against the State. Brutus. Who?â'Tis impossible. Publius. Your sons. Brutus. Come forth, Lictors!âThis month I'm consul.âGo, arrest At their own homeâyou said?âthe two young men, My sons, and bear to prison. Publius. Not alone They have offended. The Aquilian house Hath urged them to rebellion. Brutus. Seize the band, And save the city. Publius, go forth. [Exeunt Publius and Lictors. Vindex. Look not like that, master. They'll escape, because of their age and foolishness. Yet I saw them sign the papers. Slay me! Brutus. Vindex, run home,âtheir mother. . . . Vindex, run! Tell her . . . You know . . . run! I am consul! Quick! Vindex. Where are you going, master? What shall you do? Brutus. Stand, stand! Vindex. I think he's witless, but I must be gone. There's no compression about his lips, that makes him look so strange. Oh, that I might die this moment! [Looking after him.] May the gods aid him! Exit. Brutus. The last lictors sway Round the street cornerâthey are out of sight, And . . . this is terror. I've not known before What makes the coward fly. I'll walk alone, Down by the Tiber; yon's a quiet path. [Walks by the river. What counsel one can take in solitude, What resolution! I must suffer all Before I see her; it must all be past. Here, by the river-side, I will estrange My heart from Publia, and subdue my wrath Against the traitors;â'tis their mother's looks I fear. Thou cradle of young Romulus, How often I have brought my lads to learn, Here, by the yellow mud, our hero's birth. Tiber, I will not now pollute thy stream Even with their ashes. I would hurl them down The Capitol, to rot With other refuse, but the law forbids. For them, the fasces and the axe; for me, The infamy of fatherhood. The curse That rises in me will obliterate All memory, design, intelligence: Lave me, O Tiber, lave me from my blood! Genii of the River. Waves ever streaming, Stream never gone, Tranquilly gleaming, Tiber rolls on.â Storm and distraction Dye deep its tides, Bursting contraction Of root-guarded sides; Terror and anguish Swell high its crests, Crops rot and languish, Vines are depressed. Wait:âall its raving Stoops to our will; Old channels laving, Tiber is still. Brutus. There's order, iteration, in these tides, Storm, and tranquillity. . . . Were it enough To banish them, efface them from the realm, And afterward have hope, in mine old age, Their country would recall them for fair deeds Of distant honour? Is it possible They yet might rank as honourable men? I thought not so when yesterday I doomed A stripling, though his father, weak and old, Shook with entreating sobs. My sons, my own, Ye have no father left to plead for you; I'm consul for this monthâand, see, the rods Flash blindingly betwixt us! I may weep. Genii of the Trees. With gently-heavÃ¨d branches green, With rustling airs, and doves remote, That sigh and chaunt, The woods lie peaceful; none may note, In their still haunt, Sign of the stress and whirlwind that have been.â Yet winter bows them down, Blasting them with his frown, And breaking with his lash; And storm and thunder crash Through alleys, wild with sound, Trampling the leafy ground. Pause:âand with foliage re-dressed, And honour by the milder winds allowed, The trees rejoice; Again the sunbeams through the shadows crowd; With soothÃ¨d voice, Again the boughs harmoniously rest. Brutus. What means this secret comfort and control, That gathers in my beating agony? 'Tis Earth's. She gave to me the rule of Rome; I kissed her fragrant sod. She kisses me Now with her deep, cool breath, and would confide To me another trustâto rule myself. 'Tis like my mother's eyes that day I knew How in her heart she felt I should not fail In doing some boy's duty that I shunned, Yet never told me, and I did it straight. Genii of the Air. Sunset shines across the air, Clouds are furled; Breezes hardly touch the fair, Outstretched world.â Yet oft through vales Of night, dark-faced, It rains and hails; From arm unbraced, The anger of the wrathful god is hurled. Stay:âthe heaven is clear, White, serene; Tempests disappear, Calm is seen. Brutus. [Looking up.] O stream, O earth, O air, there is a song Born in my heart that answers ye, a strain From high Olympus: 'tis the peace of law Fulfilled, the blessedness of destiny Embraced, the apprehension of that joy That plants the gods above vicissitude. 'Tis from the deep, clear ether. I am calm. [Re-enter Publius. Brutus rises to meet him.] You bring me further tidings, Publius, Of this conspiracy. Publius. The parchment signed With all the traitors' names. The truth is here. O Brutus, look and weep! Brutus. No, you mistake. Anger, not tears; deep, operative wrath! I'll read the scroll. [Exit. Publius. âHow changed! A dreadful face, Like the wax-moulded features of our sires We carry at a funeral. Alas, He surely cannot dream . . . . Nay, I'm a fool. [Exit. Scene III. âThe house of Brutus. Enter Publia and Titus. Publia. My Titus, you are restless. What is ill? Why do you glance so often up the street? Titus. Tiberius is yonder. Publia. [Aside.] Only see How, in the sun, the down gleams on his lip! He's growing such a man, and, by my faith, His little mother scarce can reach his face. [Aloud.] Ah, Titus, you are still my boy despite The toga on your shoulder, and your mouth As childish as when first I held you up To show your father it was made like mine. I think he smiled, and kissed it for my sake. You ever were a pet. Titus. Unwillingly. I used to fight your kisses. Publia. Yes, with smiles. My proud Tiberius would frown and mope, If I were over-loving. Titus. Is not that A crowd, at yon street-corner? Publia. What! you tremble. [Enter Tiberius.] Titus. They are our father's lictors. Tiberius. At their head He does not walk . . . Titus! Titus. Not so . . . Publia. My boys, You're white as ghosts. Tiberius. I'm curious, because The lictors pause. Titus. They come. O mother, mother! [Enter Lictors.] Lictor. Upon a charge of treason you're condemned To prison. We arrest you. Publia. Give the lie! Oh, tell them it is false. Titus. Plead, plead for us. Our father is so cruel. Tiberius. Titus, come. We stood up for our King. Publia. [To Lictors.] Let go your hold; Leave them alone, you have no right with them, They are the consul's sons. Lictor. Against his life They have conspired. Publia. He never will believe it. Children, speak! They falter. Titus. Kiss me. Tiberius. We are bound. Farewell. [Exeunt with Lictors. Publia. They looked on me, a lingering, strange look,â Distant, and tremulous. With misery My pulses throb, for Brutus will return, With that set mouth that speaks not punishment, But means the very deed. I run away When he is chiding them; and they have never Offended in so deep a way as now. He will not soon forgive them. I must bear So many wretched days, their harsh disgrace Afflicting every moment; not a word To pass, or harder still, a smile; apart, Yet near to them; and they so cowed and pale, I cannot sleep till I have stolen away, And reached their beds, and heard their tired complaining, And promised to entreat for speedy pardon. [Enter Vindex.] O Brutus . . . Nay! Slave, you are panting, and you look alarmed, Your eyes are wet. New misery? O speak! Vindex. I met them, and they looked so lonely, unowned in a way. And there's no knowing what master may do. He told me to say to you he is consul this month. Publia. What can he mean? Vindex, what could he do? Vindex. Why, there's exile, and they seemed as if they were banished, had nothing more to do with the street and people. It was dreadful. Yes, there's exile . . . Publia. To lose my children from my side, to think They're growing older in another land, And no one cares to see it:âthere's no pang More bitter. O my sons! It cannot be. [Weeps. Vindex. And then there's . . . Publia. What? Vindex. O lady, they do not often banish traitors. 'Tis worse what they do. But the young masters are safe. Their father is their judge, and your brothers are fellow-prisoners. They banished the old king, and they'll overlook this business after a few years away from the city. They'd never kill . . . Publia. Vindex! Oh! Kill! [Faints. Vindex. Water! That will bring her back. Why, she's sprinkled her own cheeks. Poor little mistress! and I have done all this, and split their hearts. For the master looks like a tree that's well-nigh sawn from its roots. Knave that I was! Publia. Their blood! you were a knave to speak like that, When they've a father powerful in the state. I shudder. Help me up. Their blood, their blood! You are a wicked, savage brute. Go hence! Vindex. âYou speak truly. I hear him coming, and I cannot bear the sight. I'll creep to the corner where the dust is thrown. I am a skulking wretch. Publia. Vindex, are those the only penaltiesâ Death, banishment? [Seeing that Vindex is gone.] Why should I need to learn? My hapless children I will save from both; A mother's knees can ask what he will grant Who gave her home and offspring. He is here. [Enter Brutus.] My husband, Brutus! Brutus. Ah, my Publia, I scarce can speak thy pure, unspotted name, And call thy children traitors. What, you kneel? Publia. For them, and for my brothers. [Aside.] Oh, his lips! Brutus. Rise, wife, this is unworthy. Would you bribe My justice with my love? Stand up by me, Let us be wedded with a stronger bond Than child or home, the link of duty done Though every joy should fail. Publia. I'll bear all grief, Though it should turn my hair to withered grey, If you will save my children. Brutus. Sit you down, And let me take your hand. Think of Lucrece, Married and happy, younger by some years Than you, a bride of some few, fleeting months, Who, forced to sin, was mighty for the good, And dared to judge herself, condemn her life To bleed for law transgressed. Oh, think of it! She judged her own life, all that beat in it, The honoured years of motherhood, the sweet Cares of the loving future. O my wife, She was the judge, and that deep agony Was given to no other. You are called Simply to acquiesce. Publia. You make me mad. Loose me! I know not anything but this:â I am their mother, and I will not go, Till you have promised that the lives are safe You kindled in my womb. Vow! Brutus. Wife, be still. Publia. You'll banish them? Brutus. Yes. Publia. And not kill? Brutus. Send them away, away . . . Publia. For many years? Brutus. I know not, but I hope For me they will be short. Publia. Oh, promise fast, What you have said, that you will banish them. Brutus. No binding words. Love, fortify yourself, Be humble in your misery. Publia. I fear. O Brutus, be not false. I am your wife, Who truly bore them, who has ever been Faithful to you. If they should come to harm, You would have seemed to give them me to take Your gift away, to have feigned the father's part, Begetting to destroy, and mocked my breast With planting to uproot; your spousal words Would be a liar's, and your acted love Deep-laid hypocrisy and long deceit. Brutus. Say nothing more. I'll wander out of doors, With the black night and stars. Go you to rest, And think of me more truly. Publia. But the boys! Twice have my pale, rejoicing hands raised up The new-born child to fill your eyes. O Brutus, Then you were ever tender. Why, the nurse, The crabbed-speaking midwife, used to say You were a very woman in the room. Brutus. Then is no more. Go in! Lift not your hands! Publia. I will not leave you. Brutus, once you knelt, I gave you all, a virgin of sixteen; And you with fifty years to make you kind, Turn from my knees. Brutus. Love, I have said. The past Hath lost its truth. Shall I arraign that too? What! judge, condemn, our early, wedded years, Their childhood, our first hopes! Let such retreat Beyond the borders of our memory, Where there is no recall. Publia. O cruel man, I'll go and sob against your pillow, Brutus, That you may think of nights, long years ago, When you have loved me. Brutus. Not as now I love, Seeking the shelter of your fortitude, In this great hour of peril. O my wife, Draw to me, be my help-mate! Publia. Save my sons! Brutus. Is that the end? Have you learnt nothing else? Publia, a moment: think of the great bond That knit our lives; henceforth our married state Is disannulled, and in my wandering thoughts I shall walk lonely; yet I cannot weep. My heart's a damp, cold cavernâtears and rock; But the firm stone hath swallowed up the drops That waste its substance: there is no remorse. [Exit. Publia sinks on the ground by the hearth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. âThe Forum. The curule chair placed for judgment. Enter Publius, Collatinus, and Lucretius. Publius. O Collatine, I fear. Men bring me word That all last night he paced about the city, Round every sacred place where altars rise, And incense loads the air. At dawn he stood Upon the Field of Mars, whence Romulus, By storm embraced, was carried to the gods. Some shepherds tell me how the consul stayed His lonely steps, and lifted up his head; They say the mighty apparition came, With splendour of the sun, as once before To Proclus Julius, who heard the charge: Be brave, and ye shall make my city great In all the earth. If thus it spake again, Brutus will not be moved. Lucretius. Nor meet he should. Collatinus. We're bound by ties of our humanity To rescue him from any such offence As murder of his children. Lucretius. There's no spice Of the wolf's nurture now-a-days. Our girls Are fiercer than their husbands. Collatinus. O my sire, Her death was cruel. Do not urge a deed Of iterated anguish. My Lucrece, Lay silence on his tongue, come from the shades, And hold him back! It is impiety To press a parent to destroy his sons; The gods abhor such crime. Restrain your mouth, You who have have been a father, I beseech, From counsel so unnatural. Lucretius. Ha, ha! What should you know of fatherhood? We men Who breed the nation, rather would we live Unwedded, or die childless, than affront Our ancestors with infamous descent, And stained posterity. A noble sire Must call strong death to overthrow disgrace, As Brutus will to-day. I had no need. She died, and proved her parentage. Collatinus. They come,â The lictors with the downcast criminals, The consul, with fixed eyes, and at his side, A flinching shape, a slavish countenance. Who is the man? Lucretius. 'Twill be a day for Rome! [Enter Brutus, Vindex, the Prisoners, attended by Lictors.] Brutus. [To Lictors.] Place the accused before me. Vindex, rise! Give me your hand. See, fellow-citizens, The saviour of your freedom, this old slave. He, in the chamber where the traitors met, Heard, without treachery, by god-made chance, All that they, vile, imagined, and with oath Swore as a man to dare. They went their way, Leaving him unseen guardian of the scroll Scored with their crime. Long while he weighed his course, Betraying them by speech, by silence you, Me, and our bondless city. [Holding up the scroll.] This declares The choice he made. He went to Publius, He spake to save our liberties. Shall he, Who so conceived of freedom's nobleness, Be longer deemed a bondsman, a mere serf, With thralled imagination? All. Nay, he stands Emancipated, and we praise his deed With grateful voices lifted in acclaim. Titus. What, Vindex! Brutus. Thou art free, thy chains are loosed. I never was thy master with such joy As now thy fellow-citizen. Look up, And greet thy honour. Fall'st thou at my feet? Vindex. I thank your worships, I thank you; but 'tis bred in the bone. Master, I'll never leave you. O gentles, O good Roman senators, O my dear master, if I am deserving, if I have served, if ye hold to rewarding me, I ask but one thing, and I pray you to have mercy on my prayers. Spare them, spare the young masters; strike away their chains, and I'll be old Vindex for ever; no disrespect to the freedom you've given me. But they're born to it. Fetters on their white wrists!âit makes me dead ashamed and frantic. They are not many to spare, and I'll remain your faithful slave. Brutus. I hear thee not, and must command thee hence. Vindex. O master, think again; forgive them. Your worships look moved; help me to my reward. It's all naught what you've done at me; I'm not changed by a hair's-breadth. But, oh! they are changed. Their eyes do not tell me what to do; there's a fear in them as they dared not look about. It sickens me. I've no chattels; they're all that I have in the world. Brutus. Remove this man; he doth not know his place. Vindex. [Aside.] Ay, he does, and he'll set your little light this evening, come what will. But we can never speak together; there'll be no matter, and such guilt on us. For the wonderful, great deed is worse than wickedness. We shall never over-get it. [Goes behind a pillar. Brutus. Now must I turn to judgment. These you see Are traitors proved. I hold the very deed That seals their condemnation. They have signed Their sentence with their names,âbehold. For this, The darkest crime within our city's code, Death is the righteous penalty. Titus. Not death! Brutus. What can you urge against the doom? Aquilius. Our faith To Rome's old kings, the line of Romulus, The makers of this city, of the laws By which ye would condemn us. We defy Your reading of their import. Brutus. [To his sons.] Have ye aught To say? Tiberius. I have not spoken. Brutus. Titus, you? Titus. Put me away from you, but not from life. It is too soon. O father, let me live. I did it all in play, in very sport; I ever honoured you. You cannot kill. O the blue sky!ânot death! Brutus. Ye patient gods . . . Titus. You called me to the earth. I hardly knew Its earliest joys that I should have the pain Of going where they weep through dayless time. O father, on all sides are axes, rods, Like groves about the way to death; their shade Gathers. Oh help me! Brutus. Senators, I now Would finish. Titus. All who know me as his son, All fathers here, beseech for us to live. Collatinus. Consul, there is a milder banishment Than that to dusk Avernus. O'er the bounds Of Rome the sorrows of the exile wait Those who are proved unworthy of her faith. Let these young countrymen no more consort With us, frequent the shrines and hilly ways; The hearth no longer glow for their return, The household gods no longer watch their steps. Publius. O Brutus, we are men; thy mood extreme Forces our nature overmuch. Relent! Titus. I hardly feel that I am on my knees, I am so mad to hear you bid me live. Brutus. I do not bid you die; I sentence you To death. Titus. O gods infernal! Like the rush Of under water through a riven ship, A hopeless darkness soaks into my life. I sink, I'm lost. Save me! Tiberius. I ever felt That I was born for some great cruelty, To learn how pitiless a father is Who never loved his children. Brutus. For your life You also ask? Tiberius. No; that to give or take Is yours, but as you judge, so must we learn How meagrely you rate us, though your breath Is housed within us. Titus. Dearest father, once You caught my hand upon the Tiber's bank, Because the mud was slipping towards the stream. Then I was ignorant, and death was naught. Publius. He rises. Brutus. Lictors! Titus. Speak not to these men, Unless to tell them we are not to die. Think of our mother. Round about our birth Was love, thy smiling brow, soft tendance, care, The waiting nurses, gentle-handed. These Relentless visages, these bitter rods, Their unexpended anguish, the fierce axe, Thy front like metalâround our death are these! Is this the end of nurture? this? O gods! Would I had died before I knew thy face, Or thought thou wert my father, long before My mother formed the title on my lips. Collatinus. Our tears entreat for them. Publius. From Roman eyes Drops this demand for pity. Brutus, turn. Lucretius. My daughter casts the shield of her great act 'Tween him and your entreaties. He'll not budge. I read his valour in the steady eyes With which he met her blood. Brutus. I bid you keep The lawful silence, while I speak the doom. Titus. O Father of the Capitol, great Jove, Hold him from speech, forbid his tongue! Tiberius. In vain. Would all the shame were ended! Titus. Save me, save! Vindex. [Aside.] I can bear it no longer, to hear them fight with their voices for life. [He kneels at the feet of Brutus.] Master, for very pity's sake, strive not to be as the gods. 'Tis an infamy. See, there's rain from your children's eyes, and not a Roman cheek unwashed. Let the waters of our misery soften you! Publius. He speaks what fills our silence. Collatinus. For our breasts Are heavy with compassion. All. Spare their lives. Collatinus. Let them be banished. Brutus, spare yourself. Titus. Let us not perish. Father, keep your name, Kill not its meaning! Brutus. Lictors, to your work! Scene II. âThe house of Brutus. By the hearth, Publia. Publia. The fire is out, cinders on everything, Yet a fierce hope within me. I have tried To pass the door, to look into the street; It's like the brink of a great precipice, That dizzies to behold. Here on the spot, Where he has left me by the hearth, I'm held, A stricken thing. . . . The silence seems to grow A little colder every breath I draw; It bars the air from me, and no one comes,â Not Vindex. . . . Hark, I hear the cooing doves, The life, the wail, the love! They shall not die. Life, life! It is impossible. They come. [Enter Brutus.] Where are my sons? [He starts, then points downwards. I cannot faint. I rise Against you. All my womanhood detests, And faces you. My sons! You saw them die Naked and torn? You were a monster then! Brutus. Nay, Publia, not monster, more a man, Though one that's hurt for ever, with a wound That Lethe could not heal. But yet the law Is without hurt, it's sacred body shows No scar of violence, no red assault, No desecrating stab of treachery, And base exception. What though this poor flesh Is hewn with murder, though my fatherhood Hath died beneath the fasces, if there stand Perfect and unattempted that great form That rules the deeds of men! Publia. Child-murderer! Brutus. And thou didst yield thee to the servitude And yoke of marriage simply for the boon Of offspring! Slavish, mercenary lust! How worthless is the woman when her name Of mother is withdrawn! Publia. [Aside.] I'm dumb afraid. I would that I were far away on wastes, Where I might call my children back, and shriek. Brutus. [Turning away.] Is this my house? 'Tis after some great change Things alter thus. I would assure myself I am where I have lived. Let's look about. No fireâand bread unbroken. . . . O gods, gods! This is the little tablet where the boys First learnt to write their letters. Publia, Put it away. Mine eyes have borne enough. Publia, you must not break the news again; Vile traitors! . . . but to doom the little lads Scratching their alphabet! I shall become Brute, idiot, childish, raving, imbecile, If you will force me to condemn my sons. [Sinking on a seat with groans. Publia. He raves. [Going to the door.] Your master! Vindex!âAll the house Echoes, yet no one comes. I think I hear My name upon his breath. I could not go, Nor touch him.âVindex!âIn this solitude Is fate. I must returnâHelp!ânot to him, But to the icy hearth. [In low tones.] I have no home. Brutus. [Frantically rising.] Vindex, come in! He should have lien with you, Being a slave. . . . You are Co-mated. . . . I have cast her off; 'twere well To have my wife debased before mine eyes; It were a lighter thing Than in the forum to pour forth my blood At lictors' bidding. In Avernus' dusk, I will stretch hands to them: they are my deed, My act, my infamy, my viler part. Thorough the throngs of Hades we will pace, And I will bear them garlanded about As some triumphal spoil. Think not that e'er I will resign them to you: they are mine. You have no home, for here, upon the hearth, I leave you unespoused, and comfortless, No Roman matron, a degraded wife, A stranger, a conspirator, a slave. [Publia swoons. [Enter Vindex.] O Vindex, hither! You have lost your charge. Take you this woman to your custody, Treat her in pupilage; 'tis my command You tend her, Vindex. I shall look on her No more: it may be you will find her dead; Bring not her ashes to me. Cling to her. You have been ever faithful. Vindex. Ay, to you. It's brought us to this pass. [Aside.] Oh, he's a man Too fearful to consort with womankind.â My pretty mistress. Brutus. [Turning to look on her as she lies.] But Tiberius Had nothing of her looks: he died a man. [Exit. Scene III. âThe Senate. Brutus, Collatinus, Publius, and Senators. Publius. The Tarquins are in arms. Collatinus. They press on Rome. Sextus and Aruns lead Etruscan bands, That devastate and hasten. Publius. In the city The people harness for the coming fray, And burn to strike for freedom. Let all swear The oath that nevermore a king shall rule, Nor anything remain within our walls That threatens liberty. Collatinus. Lo! Brutus speaks. Brutus. Consul, to you I turn, not willingly, But with firm trust. I love you, yet for Rome I speak what seems like hatred. All the folk Chafe at the name you bearâTarquiniusâ It binds them to the memory of wrongs; Its syllables enslave them. Collatine, Quit us for ever, of your own accord, In amity; complete the benefit Of building up a state, forego your place, And leave Rome a republic. Collatinus. As ye will. Brutus, you called me to the government, And now dismiss me,âfor an accident. This is your justice? Brutus. Friend, the people's dread Is groundless, yet they hold you bear the taint Of tyranny: endure the ignorance That blunders for the common weal. Senators. Depart, Crowned by your country's love. Collatinus. Your jealousy Procures this exile. Am I treasonous? Read my offence. Brutus. [Aside.] By heaven, his consulship Is dearer than a child! [Aloud.] Reluctance shows The people's fear well augured. You resist? Senators. Take all your wealth. Collatinus. I'll travel to the home, Among Collatia's vines, where once I lived Not lonely. Fare ye well. Brutus. Peace! let us rise, And mutely do him honour. In his stead [Exit Collatinus. One must be chosen to conduct the war, That straightly must engage us. Senators. Publius. Interprets best the citizens' desires. Brutus. And, for my part, I should confirm their choice, Which must be made in haste. Let messengers Summon the centuries; at early dawn Rome marches with her consuls to the field. Despatch this business, and return to me. I crave a second wisdom, for my friend [Exeunt Publius and Senators. Is gone from me; 'tis the last severance; I have divorced them all. No private love Remains to me; my spirit, forced to wait On the slow lips of deity, hath need Of leisure absolute from base affairs Of place, of honour, and of precedence. Yet is my heart constrained for room to hold Its joys, its aspirations, its belief:â Mine eyes are hindered from their goal. Oh, fast As fore-lived things crowd through the musing brain, The wide, delivering ages press on me, And all my wasting passions of regret Put on virility and seek to serve. What mans one like to-morrow? [Looks down on the crowd, mustering in the Field of Mars.] Goodly sight! O Romulus, they muster on thy plain, They dominate; and in this general joy, This buzz of liberty, I find release From my o'erpressing heart. My hope is built Upon the multitude; in them are hid The treasures of the commonwealth, and as They grow into a people, from the source And fountain-head of freedom they will frame The laws that shall exalt. Lo! Publius Is chosen. [Advances to meet him as he re-enters, with Senators.] Hail, my brother! Publius. Dearest bond! Brutus, I feel an army in myself From those acclaiming voices. Senators. Victory Attend your holy war! Brutus. [To Publius.] Our day is won. [Exeunt. Scene IV. âHouse of Brutus. Publia, hanging round an urn; Vindex by her. Vindex. Nay, come out, mistress, and let the old slave reach you some food. You've tasted not a bit, and your cheeks wax as white as the ashes you dote on. Publia. Ashesâthe strong, young limbs, the joyous hearts, The comely faces! Ashesâall my toil, My child-bed labour, and my nursing cares! My pride, and all my motherhood burnt out; And this the casket of my wedded loveâ This urn? The icy metal strikes within, And kills my feeble heart. Cold death, make haste. Vindex. [Aside.] It all comes of that eaves-dropping. I'm punished, for it never leaves my earsâtheir shrieks, their cries for life, and the rods harrying themâit never stops. Yet she bade me dodge about and follow them. To think that they could touch their father's life. I'd have winked at lesser villanies. And she does not see how he misses them; that's worse. He's no pity for himself, and he gets none. [Aloud.] Lady, you think not of your husband. You'll not die and leave him untended? I could but wait on him, and all the while he'd be alone. A wife can find her way within a man. Publia. I know no entrance. I could only reach His distant being as his matron-wife, The mother of his children. He hath shut That gate, and barred it. I can never more Come back to him. I'm banished, and must die. Vindex. Mistress, he is so tender about your health and sorrows. He sent me to watch you, and stroked the head of a little music-girl, urging her to play you back into comfort. But the child is frightened. Publia. Brutus, I feel itâBrutus, thou art great. But I am weak, and have no part at all In what remains, now thou hast slain my sons, And all my spousal brought to thee is gone. Vindex. She pants and clings to the bronze as she'd press her heart through it. Her head droops. Mistress! Publia. My children, I will journey to attest You have a mother still, who dies to keep Her boys about her. Titus, do you moan, Lost on the dull strand, shivering, condemned? I'll come and play with you unearthly games Around the mournful willows. I belong Wholly to you, my sons. I brought ye forth, And cherished. Now I'll fend for ye in hell. Vindex. [Looking doubtfully at her.] I'll fetch master. She'll not mind him now. He's kept away, for she never spoke to him, and her look was like a dumb creature's. Yet she's not hurt like him; she'll recover, when she gets to her boys. They may be a bit changed; but no matter; they're hers, and she'll own them. The lord Jupiter must look to his case; it's a mystery for the gods. Now, I wonder, shall I let be, or make believe she asked for him at the last. Nay, nay, I'll just beckon him. I'm a free man, and must leave off my slave's juggleries. [Exit Vindex. Publia. Together come and meet me. You are mine, Not his, not his! Gods! they are shuddering, As though a spectre beckoned them. I'll keep My flesh and blood;âboys, it is just the same. There's a dark river rushing past my eyes; Don't wail so on the banks. A lullaby, For ye are children still. Ah, I forget. [A strain of timid music. Hades is tongueless, Death hath no lyre; Deep, deep the rest he gives From life's long tire, Laying the fevered heart Far from desire. He with oblivion Comes as a charm, Nought that hath chanced to us Further can harm; Passion, vicissitude, Break not our calm. Fear of the future Ageing to-day, Terrors of clinging love, Presage, dismay, Senseless, distorting hope, Death puts away. He is the Helper; What can transcend His care that provideth For grief, an end, For rest, eternity? Death is our friend. [It stops; she dies. [Enter Brutus and Vindex.] Brutus. Nay, Vindex, back! Before I enter in I know what is. [Exit Vindex.] O death, how soft Thou work'st thy sentence! The reproach is gone, And these young lips, that I have never touched Since her sons' kiss, recoil from me no more. Farewell, farewell! I have no part in ye; My murderer's work is done. Now, when the Lars Are wreathed, on happy days of festival, When families are gathered round the hearth, What worship shall I bring? Before the gods I stand abhorred and monstrous. Shall I hope To found a state upon a rifled home, A murdered matron, a polluted house? Can chastity and justice win no awe Save by such sacrifice? Ah me! What guilt It takes to breed one virtue. Would that heaven Might judge me in the midst of my remorse, And, by this urn and slowly-blanching corpse, Assign my doom. I would feel punishment, For in myself I cannot suffer more; I grow a blank, and shall be imbecile Unless I am afflicted. What! a stir, A message in the air, a company Of blessÃ¨d spirits, a triumphant strain! Lares. [Whispering.] Brutus, Brutus! Soon shall we meet thee; Thy ancestors, fathers, Loftily greet thee; We of high influence The guardians sublime, With memory lighting Indifferent time; We who at festivals Silently trod, Each served, unbeholden, An intimate god. Soon shall thy glorious, Terrible fame, Wake young futurity, Awed by thy name. Lemures. [Sighing.] Woe, Woe! We have no part nor lot In honour's state, We are remembered not, Or cursed by hate. Thy children, we shall crouch Far from thy shade, In uncheered company, Dumb and dismayed. No willing feasts of joy To us are made, Only propitiations desolate From men afraid. Alas, Alas! Lares. Joy and eternal praise. Scene V. âThe battle-field. Enter Aruns, Sextus, and Etruscans. Aruns. Advance, the light yet tarries, clear and full. At night-fall we are victors. Sextus. Grant, O Mars, I meet this Brutus in his borrowed mantle, And strike him down beneath his lictors' feet! The lust of battle scorches me. Aruns. Lead on The troops of Veii; the Tarquinian band, Follow my voice and guidance! Sextus. I will sweep Round to the left wing of the enemy. Our wrongs! Revenge! [Exit with Veientines. Aruns. Here tramps the Roman front. [Enter Brutus and Romans.] Gods of my fathers, purple-robÃ¨d shades Of rod-encircled kings, avert your gaze; Wail in dishonoured tombs, your state and garb Consigned to yon plebeian. Regal blood Within my veins, be tameless; fire my breast, Ancestral splendours! I will slay the thief, Or join the plundered spectres. Brutus. Yonder rush The hireling soldiers of a broken cause; The king's most royal son is at their head, Aruns. He seeks us. Romans, prove your birth, Show how free swords can vanquish. Face them! March. A Roman Soldier. The generals! Behold! Each bears on each, Like meeting eagles, and the very dust They raise conflicts before-hand. Roman gods, Keep the great consul! Aruns. Brutus, in your heart My spear demands atonement. Brutus. And in yours Mine will complete its labours. [They engage and fall, transfixed each with the other's dart. Aruns. Here we end. Thus our blood mixes! Brutus, thus we dieâ I cannot leave thy side. Air! air!âThe kings Come up from Dis to meet me. [Dies. Brutus. Earth, thy son Resigns his rule, and faints back to thy arms. Mother, I kiss thee not; my parting breath More noiselessly shall greet thee. [Dies. Romans. Let us close, And crush these hateful strangers. He is slain, Our consul, our deliverer. Etruscans. The prince! Avenge his bleeding corpse! March on! Romans. Attack! [Exeunt fighting. [Enter Vindex.] Vindex. Where is he? I'm wounded, yet I cannot die till I've found him. I'm not a slave now, and can follow to the wars. But it's a strange place this battle-field, and it dazes one. Or, it may be, I'm faint. [Coming on the body of Brutus.] He's turned to earth, and the red blood in the dust. I'm dying; I cannot raise him. O master, this is the freedom, and the gods give it to us all. . . . It grows dark and rains. Tears end our story. [Dies. [Enter Romans.] Romans. We conquer the Veientines, but the Tarquins Press hardly on our comrades. Haste to help! [Exeunt. [Enter Sextus.] Sextus. A hateful sight!âmy brother and this man By their death-dealing spears thus locked together. Aruns, I grudge thy place, thy streaming blood, Ennobled for all ages. Here I stand, Marked for a death obscure. My raging pride Yearned to be quenched in this avenger's heart; It groans denied: my brother is preferred. The Fates are women, and my end will be Poor with their petty malice; yet their spite Shall reach not to the generation's goal. There's in me what is fatal, what shall kill, When I am dead and swordless. If this man Is Roman, so am I; my burning lust, My appetite for domination, greed Demanding for its ease a universe, Abashed and sycophantâare these not powers Of Roman birth, immortal tendencies? Empire shall triumph. Coldly go the years 'Neath the chaste rule of consuls, but the flame Is rising with the centuries, until, Above the city's prostrate purity, Will breathe compelling lust. Ha, ha! Lucrece, The Rome that thou didst deem so virgin-like, Whose gates I cannot force with all my war, Shall bear the imprint of the ravisher. I've nature with me; Brutus had the gods; He trusted to allies: I trust the race, The ardour of the brood, the burning sky, The bitter, trampling pride. He drove me forth From home and rule, he branded me with shame, He lies with lips to earth, as when I turned And looked on him at Delphi. Thou didst well, Thou some-time Lord of Rome, to kiss the ground. Back to thy mother's arms! Thy destiny Hath been fulfilled: and mine hath yet to come. [Exit. [Enter Publius and Romans.] Publius. The sacred groundâÃsuvian meadow-land, And Arsian grove,âis deluged; rain and blood Blind us; we cannot see the enemy; We can but feel, with blundering steps, the slain. [Enter more Romans.] How stands the foe? Soldier. The wind so baffled us, It tore away our sight; we dared not pierce The dark; it stood against us as a host, And we were driven backward. 2nd Soldier. Let us pray The heavens to enlighten us, our case Is desperate. [Enter Marcus with Soldiers.] Publius. How fares the Etruscan band? Marcus. They shriek and count the dead confusedly, Uncertain of the triumph; here and there The fight continues 'mid the struggling troops. We came upon a Tuscan in retreat, Who groped about, and cursed the elements. On him we drew; but in a deadly grip He hugged us, shouting, Sextus has his day, Then leapt with shrilling laughter in the night. What after chanced none knows; the hurricane Spread her fell targe betwixt us; much we fear He has escaped. Publius. And better thus than slain; Let no free Roman touch him. A Soldier. He is dread. I fear the Tarquins will return to Rome. Another. The hateful race! They will enslave the land. Thus is Lucretia righted? Publius. Romans, hear! Night is upon us, and our destiny Uncertain; not to-day shall be the end, Nor I myself shall see the tyrants' blood Dabbling your fields; but I shall rear ye up A people of such honour that my rods Shall be avaled before you. Ye, yourselves, Shall brave the Latins by Regillus' lake,â Your youths, so fair a cavalry, the gods Shall ride beside them, and with them, transfix The Tarquins on their spears, and over-tramp Vile, slinking Sextus. When the fight is o'er, At Vesta's holy temple, where the spring Gushes, two horsemen shall wash off the stains Of battle, and when men shall crowd around For tidings of the field, say how 'twas won. And a new fane shall rise where Lucrece lay, In the centre of the forum. I would live To see that day; I shall not, but 'twill be. All. Publius Valerius, our Publicola, The people's friend! Publius. As the deep shadows grow, Let us all gather where our Brutus lies. 1st Soldier. We'll raise his statue in our midst. 2nd Soldier. Our wives Will never dry their tears for him, he stood So mightily their friend. Marcus. He felt the wrongs Of women as they'd natures of their own, And use beyond child-bearing. Publius. Sacred use Is theirs: the State will find her councillors In creatures that have known no touch of man. Our pious Numa felt the mystery Of Vesta's service could not be divined By families in worship round the hearth, And to six spotless virgins gave the charge Of her undying fire. They guard for us The pledge of fate, the awful, sealÃ¨d jar Of Rome's supremacy. O Marcus, fear That part of womanhood that's like a shrine: Methinks as sons we sometimes enter it, As spouses never. Marcus. And you deem Lucrece Changed all? Publius. She changed our Brutus from a baulked, Uncertain creature to a steadfast man. [Lifting Brutus.] Marcus, look long at our dead consul's face. Shall Tarquin over-live it? Marcus. Till the brood Be wholly extirpate, I cannot die. Publius. [Still looking on Brutus.] Oh, 'tis a further vision, it transcends! He's dropt a secret in the common ear Will never be forgotten. Lo, the moon Shines clear above the tempest, and reveals Our enemy. [Enter Etruscans.] Etruscans. We claim the day. One man We've struck beyond the number of your slain. Voice (from the Arsian grove). Rome hath the victory, She that obeys. Nature from dewy groves, High forest ways, Lifts her mysterious, Subjugate voice, Breathing dominion. Hear, Rome, and rejoice! Marcus. Meseemed across the twilight came a sound, Scarce audible, from out the ancient wood, Sighing great things that heave tumultuously 'Gainst my enthrallÃ¨d heart. Publius. Etruscans, say, Heard ye a solemn, rustling oracle? Etruscans. With fear we heard, we throw away our arms, The powers of earth declare against our strife; We are your suppliants. Publius. Amity and grace We grant to you for ever, who submit To law and our Republic. We will keep This joyful peace with all solemnity. But first, within the shadow of the trees, We'll lay great Brutus in his silent tomb, Where evening winds shall stir the many boughs That chose uncrownÃ¨d Rome to rule the world.</field>
