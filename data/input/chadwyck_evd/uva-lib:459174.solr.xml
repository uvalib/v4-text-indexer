      <field name="fulltext">THE JEALOUS LOVERS. A Comedie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">?Valeat res ludicra, sime Palma negata macrum, donata reducit opimum.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Worshipfull Mr. Dr. COMBER, Dean of Carleil, Vicechancellour of the Universitie of Cambridge, and Master of Trinity-Colledge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To that compleat and noble Knight, Sir Kenellam Digbie. Sir, when I look on you, me thinks I see To the full height, how perfect man may be. Sure all the Arts did court you, and you were So courteous as to give to each their share, While we lie lock'd in darknesse, night and day Wasting our fruitlesse oyl and time away, Perchance for skill in Grammar, and to know Whether this word be thus declin'd or no, Another cheats himself, perchance to be A prety youth, forsooth, in fallacie: This on Arithmetick doth hourely lie, To learn the first great blessing,âMultiply. That travels in Geometry, and tires, And he above the world a map admires. This dotes on Musicks most harmonious chime, And studying how to keep it, loses time. One turns o're histories, and he can show All that has been, but knows not what is now. Many in Physick labour, most of these Lose health, to know the name of a disease. Some (too high wise) are gazing at a starre, And if they call it by his name, they are In heaven already. And another one That cries Melpomene, and drinks Helicon, At Poetrie throws wit and wealth away, And makes it all his work to write a play. Nay, on Divinity many spend their powres, That scarce learn any thing, but to stand two houres. How must we, Sir, admire you then, that know All Arts, and all the best of these can show? For your deep skill in State, I cannot say, My knowledge there is onely to obey: But I beleeve 'tis known to our best Peeres, Amaz'd to see a Nestor at your yeares. Mars claims you too, witnesse the Gallion, That felt your thunder-bolts at Scanderon, When Neptune frighted let his Trident fall, And bid his waves call you their Generall. How many men might you divide your store Of vertues to, and yet not leave you poore, Though enrich them? Stay here. How dare I then To such an able judgement show my pen? But 'tis, Sir, from a Muse that humbly prayes, You'le let her ivie wait upon your bayes. Your admiring servant, T. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the truely noble Knight Sir Christopher Hatton. To you (whose recreations, Sir, might be Others imployments, whose quick soul can see There may, besides a hawk, good sport be found, And musick heard, although without a hound) I send my Muse. Be pleas'd to heare her strain When y' are at truce with time. 'Tis a low vein. But were her breast inrag'd with holier fire, That she could force, when she but touch'd her lyre, The waves to leap above their clifts, dull earth Dance round the centre, and create new birth In every Element, and out-charm each Spheare, 'Twere but a lesson worthy such an eare. T. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his honoured Friend, Mr. Anthony Stafford. Sir, had my Muse gain'd leisure to conferre With your sharp judgement, e're I ventur'd her On such an audience, that my Comedie Had suffer'd by thy Obelisk, and thee: It needed not of just applause despair, Because those many blots had made it fair. I now implore your mercy to my pen, That should have rather begg'd your rigour then. T. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Colendissimo viro, &amp; juris municipalis peritissimo, Magistro Richardo Lane. Sir, if the Term be done, and you can finde Leisure to heare my suit, pray be so kinde To give this toy such courteous acceptation, As to be made your client ith' vacation. Then if they say I break the Comick laws, I have an advocate can plead my cause. T. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his deare friend, Thomas Riley. I will not say I on our stage have seen A second Roscius; that too poore had been: But I have seen a Proteus, that can take What shape he please, and in an instant make Himself to any thing; be that, or this, By voluntary metamorphosis. When thou dost act, men think it not a play; But all they see is reall: O that day, (When I had cause to blush that this poore thing Did kisse a queens hand, and salute a king) How often had I lost thee? I could finde One of thy stature, but in every kinde Alter'd from him I knew; nay, I in thee Could all professions, and all passions see. When thou art pleas'd to act an angry part, Thou fright'st the audience; and with nimble art Turn'd Lover, thou dost that so lively too, Men think that Cupid taught thee how to wooe. T'expresse thee all would ask a better pen; Thou art, though little, the whole mappe of men. In deeper knowledge and Philosophie Thou truely art what others seem to be, Whose learning is all face: as 'twere thy fate There not to act, where most do personate. All this in one so small; nature made thee To show her cunning in epitomie; While others (that seem giants in the arts, Such as have stronger limbes, but weaker parts) Are like a volume, that contains lesse in't, And yet looks big, 'cause 'tis a larger print. I should my self have too ungratefull shown, Sent I not thee my book:âTake't, 'tis thine own. For thus farre my confession shall be free, I writ this Comedie, but 'twas made by thee. Thy true friend, T. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Amico suo charissimo, ingeniosissimo, T. Randolpho, liberum de ejus ComÅdia judicium. Desert keeps close, when they that write by guesse, Scatter their scribbles, and invade the presse. Stage Poets ('tis their hard, yet common hap) Break out like thunder, though without a clap. Here 'tis not so; there's nothing now comes forth, Which hath not for a licence its own worth. No swagg'ring tearms, no taunts; for 'tis not right, To think that onely toothsome which can bite. See how the Lovers come in Virgin die, And Rosie blush, ensignes of modestie, Though once beheld by such with that content, They need not fear others disparagement. But I'le not tell their fortune, what e're't be, Thou must needs know't, if skil'd in Palmestrie. Thus much, where King applauds, I dare be bold To say, 'Tis Pettie-treason to withhold. Edward Hide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his dearest friend the Author, after he had revised his Comedie. The more I this thy master-piece peruse, The more thou seem'st to wrong thy noble Muse, And thy free Genius: If this were mine, A modest envie would bid me confine It to my studie, or the Criticks court, And not make that the vulgar peoples sport, Which gave such sweet delight unto the King, Who censur'd it not as a common thing, Though thou hast made it publick to the view Of self-love, malice, and that other crue. It were more fit it should impaled lie Within the walls of some great librarie; That if by chance through injurie of time, Plautus, and Terence, and that Aristophanes. fragrant thyme Of Attick wit should perish; we might see All those reviv'd in this one comedie. The Jealous Lovers, Pander, Gull, and Whore, The doting Father, Shark, and many more Thy scene doth represent unto the life, Beside the character of a curst wife: So truly given, in so proper stile, As if thy active soul had dwelt a while In each mans body; and at length had seen How in their humours they themselves demean. I could commend thy jests, thy lines, thy plot, Had I but tongues enow, thy names; what not? But if our Poets, praising other men, Wish for an hundred tongues; what want we then When we praise Poets? This I'le onely say, This work doth crown thee Laureat to day. In other things how all, we all know well, Onely in this thou dost thy self excell. Edward Fraunces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his deare friend Mr. Thomas Randolph, on his Comedy called, The Jealous Lovers. Friend, I must grieve your poems injur'd be By that rare vice in poets, Modestie. If you dislike the issues of your pen, You have invention, but no judgement then You able are to write, but 'tis as true, Those that were there can judge as well as you. You onely think your gold adulterate, When every scale of judgement findes it weight, And every touchstone perfect. This I'le say, You contradict the name of your own play: You are no lover of the lines you writ, Yet you are jealous still of your own wit. Rich. Benefield, T. C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his ingenuous friend, the Author, concerning his Comedy. The Muses (Tom) thy Jealous Lovers be, Striving which has the greatest share in thee. Euterpe calls thee hers, such is thy skill In pastorall sonnets, and in rurall quill. Melpomene claims thee for her own, and cries, Thou hast an excellent vein for elegies. 'Tis true; but then Calliope disdains, Urging thy fancy in heroick strains. Thus all the nine: Apollo by his laws Sits judge in person to decide the cause: Beholds thy Comedy, approves thy art, And so gives sentence on Thalia's part. To her he dooms thee onely of the nine; What though the rest with jealousie repine? Then let thy Comedie, Thalia's daughter, Begin to know her mother Muse by laughter. Out with't, I say, smother not this thy birth, But publish to the world thy harmlesse mirth. No fretting frontispece, nor biting Satyre Needs usher't forth: born tooth'd? fie, 'tis 'gainst nature. Thou hadst th' applause of all: King, Queen, and Court, And University, all lik't thy sport. No blunt preamble in a Cynick humour Need quarrell at dislike, and spight of rumour Force a more candid censure, and extort An approbation, maugre all the court. Such rude and snarling prefaces suit not thee, They are superfluous: for thy Comedie, Backt with it's own worth, and the authours name, Will finde sufficient welcome, credit, fame.

      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS I. SCENA I. Simo, Asotus, Ballio. Simo. How thrives my boy Asotus? is he capable Of your grave precepts? Ball. Sir, I never met A quicker brain, a wit so neat and spruce. Well,âget thee home old Simo: go and kneel: Fall on thy aged knees, and thank the gods Th'hast got a boy of wax, fit to receive. Any impressions. Asot. As I am a Gentleman, And first of all our family, you wrong me, Dad, To take me for a dunce. Sim. No, good Asotus; It is thy fathers care, a provident care, That wakes him from his sleeps to think of thee: And when I brooding sit upon my bags, And every day turn o're my heaps of gold, Each piece I finger makes me start, and cry, This, this, and this, and this is for Asotus. Asot. Take this, and this, and this, and this again: Can you not be content to give me money, But you must hit me in the teeth with't?âS'lid. Ball. Nay, good Asotus, such a loving father That does not blesse you with a sweaty palm Clap't on your head, or some unfruitfull prayer; But layes his blessings out in gold and silver, Fine white and yellow blessings. Asot. Prithee Ballio, I could endure his white and yellow blessings, If he would leave his prating. Sim. Do you heare him? How sharp and tart his answers are? Old Simo, Th'hast got a witty witty wagge, yet deare one, When I behold the vastnesse of my treasure, How large my coffers, yet how cramb'd with wealth, That every talent sweats as in a crowd, And grieves not at the prison, but the narrownesse. Asot. If I make not room for 'um, ne're trust me. Simo. When I see this, I cannot choose but fear Thou canst not finde out wayes enow to spend it: They will out-vie thy pleasures. Ball. Few such fathers! I cannot choose but stroke your beard, and wonder, That having so much wealth, you have the wit To understand for whom you got it. Asot. True: And I have so much wit to understand It must be spent, and shall boyes. Sim. Pray heaven it may! Asot. I'le live to spend it all; and thenâperhaps I'le die, And will not leave the purchase of a sheet, Or buy a rotten coffin. Ball. Yes, deare Pupill, Buy me an urn, while yet we laugh and live; It shall contain our drink, and when we die It may preserve our dust: 'tis fit our ashes Should take a nap there, where they took their liquour. Sim. Sage counsell thisâObserve in boyâobserve it. Asot. I live in Thebes, yet I dare sweare all Athens Affords not such a Tutour: thou mayst read To all the young heiresâin town or citie. Sim. Ah Ballio! I have lived a dunghill wretch, Grown poore by getting riches, mine own torture, A rust unto my self, as to my gold: To pile up idle treasure starv'd my body Thus, to a wrinckled skin, and rotten bones, And spider-like have spun a web of gold Out of my bowels; onely knew the care, But not the use of gold.âNow, gentle Ballio, I would not have my sonne so loath'd a thing: No, let him live and spend, and buy his pleasures At any rate. Reade to him, gentle Ballio, Where are the daintiest meats, the briskest wines, The costliest garments. Let him dice and wench; But with the fairest, be she wife or daughter To our best Burgesse: and if Thebes be scarce, Buy me all Corinth for him:âWhen I sleep Within my quiet grave, I shall have dreams, Fine pleasant dreams, to think with how much pleasure Asotus spends what I with care have got. Asot. Sure I were a most ungracious childe now, If I should spoil the dreams of a dead Father. Sleep when thou wilt within thy quiet urn, And thou shalt dream thou seest me drink Sack plentie, Incircled round with Doxies plumpâand daintie. Sim. How thrives my boy?âHow forward in his studies? Ball. Trothâwith much industryâI have brought him now That he is grownâpast drinking. Sim. How man? past drinking? Ball. I mean, he is grown perfect in that science. Sim. But will he not forget? Asot. No, I warrant you, I know I shan't forget, because i'th morning I ne're remember what I did o're night. Sim. How feeds my boy? Ball. Troth well: I never met A stomack of more valour, or a tooth Of such judicious knowledge. Sim. Can he wench? ha? Ball. To say the truthâbut rawly. Asot. Rawly?âI'me sure I have already made my Dad a Grandsire To five and twentyâand if I do not Out of meere charity people all the Hospitalls With my stray babes, then geld meâWo to the Parish That bribes me not to spare it. Ball. Then for the Die, He throws it with such art, so poys'd a hand, That had you left him nothing, that one mysterie Were a sufficient portion. Asot. Will you see me? Set me a bag. These were an Usurers bones. Ball. In this behold what frailty lives in man: He that rub'd out a life to gather trash, Is after death turn'd prodigall. Sim. Throw, Asotus. Asot. Then have at all,âand 'twere a million.âAll! Fortune was kinde, the precious dirt is mine. Sim. And take it boy, and thisâand this beside. And 'cause desert may challenge a reward, This for your pains, deare Ballio. Ball. My endeavours, Although to my best power,âalasâcome short Of any merit; Sir you make me blush, And this reward but chides my insufficiency. Pray urge it not. Sim. A modestâhonestâhonest man: I'le double itâin faith I willâI am The joyfull'st father! Ball. See how the goodman weeps! Asot. So he will weep his gold away, no matter. Sim. Come hither deare, come, let me kisse my sonne. Asot. There's a sweet kisse indeed, this 'tis to want A Tutour; had you had my education, You would have ta'ne me by the lilie hand, Then gaz'd a while upon my flaming eyes, As wondring at the lustre of their orbes; Then humbly beg in language strow'd with flowers, To taste the cherries of my ruby lippe. God-a-mercy for this, Tutour. Sim. I am orejoy'd, I am orejoy'd. Exit Simo. SCEN. II. Asotus, Ballio. Asot. VVell, go thy waies, I may have a thousand fathers, And never have the like:âWell pockets, well, Be not so sad; though you are heavy now, You shall be lighter. Ball. Pupill, I must tell you, I do repent the losse of those good houres, And would call back the study I have ta'ne In morall Alchymie, to extract a Gentleman Almost out of a dunghill. Still do I see So much of peasant in you? Asot. Angry, Tutour? Ball. Teem'd my Invention all this while for this? No better issue of my labouring brain, After so many and such painfull throe's? Another sinne like this, and be transform'd Meere clown again. Asot. The reason, deare Instructour. Ball. Have I not open'd to you all the mysteries, The precise rules, and axiomes of Gentilitie? And all methodicall? Yet you still so dull, As not to know you print eternall stains Upon your honour, and corrupt your bloud (That cost me many a minute the refining) By carrying your own money? See these Breeches, A pair of worthy, rich, and reverent Breeches, Lost to the fashion by a lump of drosse. I'le be your bailiffe rather. Asot. Out infection. Ball. Who, that beheld those hose, could e're suspect They would be guilty of mechanick mettall? What's your vocation? Trade you for your self? Or else whose Journeyman, or Prentice are you? Asot. Pardon me, Tutour: for I do repent, And do protest hereafter I will never Weare any thing that jinglesâbut my spurres. Ball. This is gentile. Asot. Away mechanick trash: I'le kick thee sonne of earth:âThus will I kick thee,â For torturing my poore fatherâDirt avantâ I do abandon thee. Ball. Blest be thy generous tongue. But who comes here? This office must be mine: I'le make you fair account of every drachme. Asot. I'le not endure the trouble of account: Say all is spent,âand then we must have more. SCEN. III. Tyndarus, Asotus, Ballio. Tyn. What Fury shot a viper through my soul To poison all my thoughts? Civill dissension Warres in my bloud: here Love with thousand bowes And twenty thousand arrows layes his siege To my poore heart; which, man'd with nought but fear, Denies the great god entrance. O Evadne! Canst thou that risest fairer then the morn, Set blacker then the evening?âWeak jealousie!â Did e're thy prying and suspicious sight Finde her lippe guilty of a wanton smile? Or one lascivious glance dart from her eye? The blushes of her cheeks are innocent, Her carriage sober, her discourse all chaste; No toyish gesture, no desire to see The publick shows, or haunt the Theatre. She is no popular Mistresse, all her kisses Do speak her Virgin, such a bashfull heat At severall tides ebbes, flowes; flowes, ebbes again, As 'twere afraid to meet our wilder flame. But if all this be cunning, (as who knows The sleights of Sirens?) and I credulous fool Train'd by her songs to sink in her embraces; I were undone for everâwretched Tyndarus! Asot. Ha, ha, ha, he. This is an arrant Coxcombe, That's jealous of his wife ere he has got her, And thinks himself a Cuckold before marriage. Ballio. Want of a Tutour makes unbridled youth Run wildely into passions. You have got A skilfull Pilot (though I say it, Pupill) One that will steer both you, and your estate Into safe harbour.âPray, observe his humour. Tyn. Away foul sin.â'Tis Atheisme to suspect A devil lodg'd in such divinity. Call snow unchaste, and say the ice is wanton, If she be so. No, my Evadne, no, I know thy soul as beauteous as thy face. That glorious outside which all eyes adore, Is but the fair shrine of a fairer saint. O pardon me thy penitent infidell: By thy fair eyes (from whom this little world Borrows that light it has) I henceforth vow, Never to think sinne can be grown so bold As to assault thy soul. Asot. This fellow, Tutour, Waxes and wanes a hundred times in a minute: In my conscience he was got in the change o'th' Moon. SCEN. IIII. Chremylus, Dypsas, Asotus, Ballio, Tyndarus. Dyp. Rot in thy grave, thou dotard, I defie thee. Curst be our day of marriage: shall I nurse And play the mother to anothers brat? And she to nose my daughter?âTake Evadne Your prety-precious-by-blow-fair Evadne, The minion of the town: goâand provide her A place i'th' Spittle. Chrem. Gentle wife, have patience. Dyps. Let them have patience that can have patience. For I will have no patienceâS'lid. Patience? patience? Chrem. You know her daughter to our dearest friend: And should my sonne committed to his care Thus suffer as the poore Evadne does: The gods were just so to revenge her wrong. Dyp. I will not have my house afflicted with her, She ha's more suitours then a prety wench in an Universitie, While my daughter ha's leisure enough to follow her needle. Chrem. Wife, I must tell you y'are a peevish woman. Dyp. And I must tell you y'are an arrant Coxcombe To tell me so. My daughter nos'd by a slut? Asot. There will be a quarrell, Tutour: do you take The old mans part, I am o'th' womans side. Chrem. Were every vein in poore Evadne fill'd With bloud deriv'd from those, whose ancestours Transmitted in that bloud a hate to us, A lineall hate to all our family; Yet trusted to my care she is my daughter, And shall share equall blessings with mine own. Dyp. Then a perpetuall noise shall fill thy house, I will not let thee sleep, nor ear, nor drink, But I will torture thee with a peal of chiding. Thou shalt confesse the troubled sea more calm: That thunder with lesse violence cleaves the aire: The ravens, schreech-owls, and the mandrakes voice Shall be thy constant musickâI can talk. Thy friends that come to see thee, shall grow deaf With my loud clamours. Heaven be prais'd for tongue, No woman in all Thebes is better weapon'd: And 't shall be sharper; or were any member Not dead besides my tongue, I would employ it In thy just torment. I am vext to think, My best revenge age hath prevented now, Else every man should read it in thy brow. Chrem. I will not winde you up, deare larum: Go, Run out your line at length, and so be quiet. Exit Chremylus. SCEN. V. Dypsas, Tyndarus, Asotus, Ballio. Tyn. Here is an argument, Tyndarus, to incite And tempt thy free neck to the yoke of Love. Are these the joyes we reap i'th' nuptiall bed? First in thy bosome warm the snake, and call The viper to thy armsâO gentle death, There is no sleep blest and secure but thine. Wives are but fair afflictions: sure this woman Was woo'd with protestations, oaths, and vows As well as my Evadne, thought as fair, As wise and vertuous as my soul speaks her: And may not she or play the hypocrite now? Or after turn Apostate?âGuilty thoughts Disturb me not. For were the sex a sinne, Her goodnesse were sufficient to redeem And ransome all from slander. Dyp. Gentle Sir, I pity the unripenesse of your age. That cast your love upon a dangerous rock. My daughter!âBut I blush to owne the birth, And curse the wombe so fruitfull to my shame. You may be wise and happyâor repent. Exit Dypsas. SCEN. VI. Tyndarus, Asotus, Ballio. Asot. This woman is a devil, for she hates her own children. Ball. In what an extasie stands that grieved wight? Asot. In troth I shall into compunction melt. Will not a cup of Lesbian liquour rowze His frozen spirits to agilitie? Ball. Spoke like a sonne of Ãsculapius! Asot. My fathers angels guard thee. We have gold To cure thy dumps, although we do not mean It should profane these breeches. Sure his soul Is gone upon some errand, and has left The corps in pawn till it come back again. Tyn. Cold jealousie, I shall account thee now No idle passion, when the wombe that bare her Shall plead her guilt, I must forget her name. Fly from my memory, I will drink oblivion To loose the loath'd Evadne. Asot. Generous Sir, A pottle of Elixar at the Pegasus Bravely carouz'd is more restorative. My Tutour shall disburse. Tyn. Good impertinent. Asot. Impertinent? Impertinent in thy face. Danger accrues upon the word Impertinent! Tutour, draw forth thy fatall steel, and slash Till he devoure the word Impertinent. Ball. The word Impertinent will not beare a quarrell: The Epithite of Good hath mollified it. Asot. We are appeas'd.âBe safeâI sayâBe safe. Tyn. Be not rash, Tyndarus. This malicious woman May as well hate her daughter, as her husband. I am too suddain to conclude her false On such sleight witnesse. Shall I think the Sunne Has lost his crown of light, because a cloud Or envious night hath cast a robe of darknesse 'Twixt the worlds eye and mine? Asot. Canst thou, royall boy, Burn out the remnant of a day with us? Tyn. I am resolv'd upon a safer triall. Sir, you are Courtly, and no doubt the Ladies Fall out about you: for those rare perfections Can do no lesse then ravish. Asot. I confesseâ I cannot walk the streets, but straight the females Are in a tumultâI must leave thee, Thebes, Lest I occasion civill warres to rage Within thy wallsâI would be loth to ruine My native soil. Ball. Sir, what with my instructions, He has the wooing character. Tyn. Could you now But pull the maiden-blossomes of a rose Sweet as the spring it buds in, fair Evadne; Or gain her promise, and that grant confirm'd By some sleight jewell, I shall vow my self Indebted to the service, and live yours. Asot. She cannot stand the fury of my siege. Ball. At first assault he takes the female fort. Aso. And ride, loves conquerour, through the streets of Thebes. I'le tell you, Sir: You would not think how many gentlemen- ushers have, and daily do endanger their little legs, by walking early and late to bring me visits from this Ladie, and that Countesse. Heaven pardon the sinne! Ne're a man in this city has made so many chambermaids loose their voices, as I ha' done. Tyn. As how, I pray? Asot. By rising in the cold night to let me in to their Madam. If you heare a waiting-woman coughing, follow her: she will infallibly direct you to some that has been a mistresse of mine. Ball. I have read loves tactiques to him, and he knows The military discipline of wooing. To rank and file his kisses: How to muster His troops of complements, andâ Tyn. I do beleeve you. Go onâreturn victorious. O poore heart, What sorrows dost thou teem with! Here she comes. SCEN. VII. Tyndarus, Asotus, Ballio, Evadne. Tyn. And is it possible so divine a goddesse Should fall from heaven to wallow here in sinne With a Babion as this is?âMy Evadne, Why should a sadnesse dwell upon this cheek To blast the tender roses? spare those teares To pitie others, thy unspotted soul Has not a stain in't to be wash't away With penitent waters. Do not grieve, thy sorrows Have forc'd mine eyes too to this womanish weaknesse. Asot. A prety enemie. I long for an encounter. Who would not be valiant to fight under such colours? Evad. My lord, 'tis guilt enough in me to challenge A sea of teares, that you suspect me guilty. I would your just sword would so courteous be As to unrip my heart; there you shall read In characters sad lovers use to write, Nothing but innocence and true faith to you. Tyn. I have lost all distrust, seal me my pardon In a chaste turtles kisse. The doves that draw The rosie chariot of the Queen of love, Shall not be link't in whiter yokes then we. Come let us kisse, Evadne.âOut temptation! There was too much, and that too wanton heat In thy lascivious lipâGo to the stews, I may perchance be now and then a customer, But do abjure thee from my chaster sheets. Exit Tyndarus. SCEN. VIII. Evadne, Ballio, Asotus. Evad. Then from the world abjure thy self, Evadne, And in thy quiet death secure the thoughts Of troubled Tyndarus.âMy womanish courage Could prompt me on to die, were not that death Doubled in loosing him. Th' Elysian fields Can be no paradise while he's not there: The walks are dull without him. Asot. Such a qualm O'th' sudden. Ball. Fie, turn'd coward? Resolution Is the best sword in warre. Asot. Then I will on, And boldly.âYetâ Ball. What? will you lose the day E're you begin the battell? Asot. Truely, Tutour, I have an ague takes me every day, And now the cold fit's on me. Ball. Go home and blush, Thou sonne of fear. Asot. Nay, then I'le venture on Were she ten thousand strong. Hail heavenly Queen Of beauty, most illustrious Cupids daughter Was not so fair. Ball. His mother. Asot. 'Tis no matter. The silly damsell understands no Poetrie. Daigne me thy lippe as blue as azure bright. Ball. As red as ruby bright. Asot. What's that to th' purpose? Is not azure blue, as good as ruby red? Evad. It is not charitable mirth to mock A wretched Ladies griefs. The gods are just, And may requite you with a scorn as great, As that you throw on me. Asot. Not kisse a Gentleman? And my father worth thousands?âResolution Spurre me to brave atchievements. Evad. Such a rudenesse Some Ladies by the valour of their servants Could have redeem'd.âUngentle god of love, Write not me down among the happier names, I onely live a martyr in thy flames. Exit. Asot. This is such a masculine feminine gender! Ball. She is an Amazon both stout and tall. Asot. Yet I got this by strugling. If I fit you not, (a diamound ring out of her eare. Proud squeamish coynesse! Tutour, such an itch Of kissing runnes all o're me. I'le to Phryne, And fool away an houre or two in dalliance. Ball. Go, I must stay to wait on fair Techmessa, Who is as jealous of young Pamphilus, As Tyndarus of Evadne, Asot. Surely, Tutour, I must provide me a suit of jealousie: It will be all the fashion. SCEN. IX. Techmessa, Ballio. Tech. Blesse me! what uncouth fancies tosse my brain? As in yon' arbour sleep had cloz'd mine eies, Me thought within a flowrie plain were met A troup of Ladies, and my self was one. Amongst them rose a challenge, whose soft foot Should gentliest presse the grasse and quickest run. The prize for which they strove, the heart of Pamphilus. The victory was doubtfull. All perform'd Their course with equall speed, and Pamphilus Was chosen judge to end the controversie. Me thought he shar'd his heart, and dealt a piece To every Lady of the troup, but me: It was unkindly done. Ball. I have descried Tech. What, Ballio? Ball. A frost in his affections To you,âbut heat above the rage of Dog-dayes To any other peticoat in Thebes. I do not think but were the pox a woman, He would not stick to court it. Tech. O my soul! Thou hast descried too much.âHow sweet it is To live in ignorance? Ball. I did sound him home. And with such words profan'd your reputation, Would whet a cowards sword. One that ne're saw you Rebuk'd my slanderous tongue. I feel the crab-tree still, While he sat still unmov'd. Tech. It cannot be. Ball. I'le undertake he shall resigne his weapon, And forsweare steel in any thing but knives, Rather then venture one small scratch to salve Your wounded honour: or to prove you chaste, Encounter with a pin. Tech. I am no common mistresse, nor have need To entertain a multitude of champions To draw in my defence.âYet had he lov'd me, He could not heare me injur'd with such patience. Ballio, one triall more: bring me his sword Rather resign'd then drawn in my defence, And I shall rest confirm'd. Ball. Here's a fine businesse. What shall I do? go to a cutlers shop, And buy a sword like that. O 'twill not do. Tech. Will you do this? Ball. It is resolv'd. I will One way or other. Wit, at a dead lift help me. SCEN. X. PÃ¦gnium, Techmessa, Ballio. PÃ¦g. Madam, the wretched Pamphilus! Tech. What of him? PÃ¦g. Is through your cruelty and suspicion dead. Ball. That news revives me. Tech. Haste, Techmessa then: What dost thou here when Pamphilus is dead? Cast off this robe of clay my soul, and flie To overtake him, bear him company To the Elysian groves: the journey thither Is dark and melancholy: do not suffer him To go alone. PÃ¦g. Madam, I joy to see With how much sorrow you receive his death. I will restore you comfort: Pamphilus lives. Ball. If Pamphilus live, then Ballio's dead again. Tech. Do you put tricks upon me? we shall have you On a little counterfeit sorrow, and a few drops Of womans teares, go and perswade your master I am deeply in love with him. PÃ¦g. If you be not, You ought in justice. Tech. I'le give thee a new feather And tell me what were those three Ladies names Your master entertain'd last night. PÃ¦g. Three Ladies! Tech. You make it strange now. PÃ¦g. Madam, by all oaths My master bears a love so firmly constant To you, and onely you; he talks, thinks, dreams Of nothing but Techmessa. When he heares The sound of your blest name, he turns ChamÃ¦leon, And lives on that sweet aire. Here he has sent me (he layes down his sword, to pull out his letters. With letters to you; which I should deliver I know not, nor himself: for first he writes, And when that letter likes him not, begins A second stile, and so a third and fourth, And thus proceeds, then reades 'um over all, And knows not which to send: perchance tears all. The paper was not fair enough to kisse So white a hand, that letter was too big, A line uneven, all excuse prevail'd, Language, or phrase, or word, or syllable, That he thought harsh and rough. I have heard him wish Above all blessings heaven can bestow (So strange a fancie has affection taught him) That he might have a quill from Cupids wing Dipt in the milk of Venus, to record Your praises and his love. I have brought you here Whole packets of affection. Ball. Blessed occasion! (he steals away the sword. Here is a conquest purchas'd without bloud. Though strength and valour fail us, yet we see There may a field be won by policie. Exit. Tech. Go, PÃ¦gnium, tell your master I could wish That I was his, but bid him choose another. Tell him he has no hope e're to enjoy me, Yet bid him not despair. I do not doubt His constant love to me. Yet I suspect His zeal more fervent to some other saint. Say I receive his letters with all joy. But will not take the pains to read a syllable. Exit. PÃ¦g. If I do not think women were got with ridling, whippe me: Hocas, pocas, here you shall have me, and there you shall have me. A man cannot finde out their meaning without the sieve, and sheers. I conceive 'um now to be engendred of nothing but the winde and the weather-cock. What? my sword gone? Ha! Well. This same pandarly-rogue Ballio has got it; he sows suspicions of my master here, because he cudgels him into manners. And that old scold Dypsas hires him to it. How could such a devil bring forth such an Angel as my Lady Techmessa? unlesse it were before her fall. I know all their plots, and yet they cannot see 'um. Heaven keep me from love, and preserve my eyesight. Go plot Enginners, plot on: I'le work a countermine, and 'twill be brave, An old rogue over-reach'd by a young knave. Exit</field>

Proud, proud Evadne Shall know what 'tis to make a wit her foe, And such a wit as can give overthrow To male or female, be theyâman or woman. This can my Tutour do, and I, orâno man. Ball. And Pamphilus shall learn by this deare knock His liberall valour late bestowed upon me, Invention lies at safer ward then wit: This sword shall teach not to provoke the cruell. Asot. And by this jemme shall I confound a jewell. S'lid, Tutour, I have a wit too, there was a jest ex tempore. SCEN. II. Asotus, Ballio, Tyndarus. Tyn. Physicians say, there's no disease so dangerous As when the Patient knows not he is sick. Such, such is mine. I could not be so ill, Did I but know I were not well. The fear Of dangers but suspected, is more horrid Then present misery. I have seen a man During the storm, shake at the thoughts of death: Who when his eyes beheld a certain ruine, Died hugging of the wave. Were Evadne true I were too blest; or could I say she's false, I could no more be wretched.âI am well: My pulse beats musick, and my lively bloud Dances a healthfull measure.âHa! What's this Gnaws at my heart? what viperous shirt of Nessus Cleaves to my skin, and eats away my flesh? 'Tis some infection.â Asot. Tutour, let's be gone. O' my life we are dead men else. Tyn. My Asotus? Asot. Keep your infection to your self. Tyn. 'Tis love Is my infection. Asot. Nay, then I care not, Tyndarus: For that is an epidemicall disease, And is the finest sicknesse in the world When it takes two together. Tyn. Deare, deare self! How fares the darling of the age? Say, what successe? Asot. Did not I tell you, Sir, that I was born With a caul upon my face? My mother wrapt me In her own smock. The females fall before me Like trembling doves before the towring hawk, While o're the spoils in triumph thus I walk. Ball. So he takes virgins with his amorous eye, As spiders web intraps the tender flie. Asot. True, Tutour, true: for I wooe 'um with cobweb-lawn. Tyn. I know the rest of women may be frail, Brittle as glasses: but my Evadne stands A rock of Parian marble, firm and pure. The crystall may be tainted, and rude feet Profane the milkie way: The PhÅnix self, Although but one,âno virgin: E're I harbour Dishonourable thoughts of that bright maid! No Tyndarus, reflect upon thy self, Turn thine eyes inward, see thine own unworthinesse That does thy thoughts to this suspicion move: She loves thee not, 'cause thou deserv'st no love. Asot. I do not know where the inchantment lies, Whether it be the magick of mine eyes, Or lip, or cheek, or brow:âbut I suppose The conjuration chiefly in my nose. Evadne, Sir, is mine, and woo'd me first. Troth 'tis a pretie lasse; and for a woman She courts in handsome words, and now and then A polite phrase, and such a feeling appetite, That having not a heart of flint or steel, As mine's an easier temper,âI consented To give her, in the way of almes, a night Or so:âYou guesse the meaning. Tyn. Too too well. And must her lust break into open flames, To lend the world a light to view her shames? Could not she taste her Page? or secretly Admit a tuft-back'd Groom into her arms? Or practise with her Doctour, and take Physick In a close room? But thus, good heavens, to take Her stallions up i'th' streets! While sin is modest It may be healed; but if it once grow impudent, The fester spreads above all hopes of cure. I never could observe so strange a boldnesse In my Evadne. I have seen her cheeks Blush, as if modesty her self had there Layn in a bed of corall.âBut how soon Is vertue lost in women! Ball. Mistake us not, Deare Tyndarus, Evadne may be chaste To all the worldâbut him. And as for him, Diana's self, or any stricter goddesse Would loose the Virgin-zone. I have instill'd Magnetique force into him, that attracts Their iron hearts, and fashions them like steel Upon the anvile, to what shape he please. He knows the minute, the precise one minute, No woman can hold out in. Come to me, Sir, I'le teach you in one fortnight by Astrologie To make each Burgesse in all Thebesâyour cuckold. Asot. As sillie lambes do fill the wolves black jaw, And fearfull harts the generous lions paw, As whales eat lesser fries; so may you see The matrons, maids, and widows stoop to mee. Tyn. O do not hold me longer in suspence: The prisoner at the barre may with lesse fear Heare the sad sentence of his death pronounc'd, Then stand the doubfull triall. Pray confirm me. Asot. Know you this Jewel? Tyn. O my sad heart-strings crack! Asot. If your Evadne be a PhÅnix, Tyndarus, Some ten moneths hence you may have more o'th' breed. Tyn. This did I give her, and she vow'd to keep it By all the oaths religion knew. No Deity In all the court of heaven but highly suffers In this one perjurie. The diamond Keeps his chaste lustre still, when she has foiled A glorie of more worth then all those toyes Proud folly gave such price to. Asot. This? a prety toy; But of no value to my other trophies That the frail tribe has sent me. Your best jewels Are to be found, Sir, in the weaker vessels, And that's a mysterie. I have sweat out such Variety of trifles, their severall kindes Would pose a learned lapidary: my closet, By some that knew me not for Cupids favourite, Has been mistaken for a Jewellers shop. Ball. And then for ribbands, points, for knots and shoe-strings, Or to slip higher, garters, no Exchange Affords such choice of wares. Asot. PhÅbus whip Thy lazy team, run headlong to the West, I long to taste the banquet of the night. Sir, if you please, when I am surfetted To take a prety breakfast of my leavings,â Tyn. Where art thou patience? Hence contagious mists That would infect the aire of her pure fame: My sword shall purge you forth, base drosse of men, From her refined metall. Asot. Blesse me, Tutour, This is not the precise minute. Tyn. Why should I Afflict my self for her? No, let her vanish. Shall I retain my love, when she has lost The treasure of her vertue? Stay, perchance Her innocence may be wronged. Said I, perchance? That doubt will call a curse upon my head To plague my unbelief.âBut here's a witnesse Of too too certain truth stands up against her. Me thinks the flame that burnt so bright dies in me. I am no more a captive, I have shak'd My fetters off, and broke those gyves of steel That bound me to my thraldome.âMy fair prison Adiew.âHow sweetly breaths this open aire? My feet grown wanton with their libertie, Could dance and caper till I knockt at heaven With my advanced head. Come deare Asotus, There are no pleasures but they shall be ours. We will dispeople all the elements To please our palates. Midnight shall behold Our nightly cups, and weare a blacker mask, As envious of our jollities. The whole sex Of women shall be ours. Merchants shall proffer Their tender brides. Mothers shall run and fetch Their daughters (e're they yet be ripe) to satisfie Our liquorish lusts. Then Tityrus happy call, That loosing one fair maid has purchas'd all. Asot. You have an admirable methode, Tutour, If this fellow has not been i' my heart, I'le be hang'd, He speaks my minde so pat. Ha, boon couragioâ Ball. You see what more then miracles art can do. Tyn. And when we have runne o're the catalogue Of former pleasures, thou, and I, and Ballio Will sit and study new ones. I will raise A sect of new and rare Philosophers, Shall from my name be call'd Tyndarides. Asot. And I will raise another sect like these, That shall from me be call'dâAsotides. Tutour, my fellow Pupil here and I Must quaffe a bowl of rare philosophie, To pledge the health of his Tyndarides. Tyn. Come, blest restorer of my libertie. Asot. If any friend of yours want libertie In such a kinde as this, you may command me. For if the brave Tyndarides be not free, Th' Asotides shall grant them libertie. Tyn. We will be frolick, boy; and e're we part, Remember thee, Thou mighty man of art. Exeunt Tyndar, &amp; Asot. SCEN. III. Ballio, Techmessa. Ball. There is besides revenge a kinde of sweetnesse In acting mischief. I could hug my head, And kisse the brain that hatches such deare rogueries, Such loving loving rogueries.âSilly Pamphilus, With thine own sword I'le kill thee, and then trample On the poore foolish carcase. Techmessa here? Then fortune wait on my designes, and crown 'um With a successe as high as they deserve. Tech. Me thinks sometimes I view my Pamphilus Cloth'd Angel-like in white, and spotlesse robes, And straight upon a sudden my chang'd fancy Presents him black and horrid, all a stain, More loathsome then a leper. Ball. And that fancy Presents him in his likenesse. All the sinks And common shores in Thebes are cleanly to him. Tech. Peace, thou foul tongue. Ball. Nay, if you be so squeamish, I ha' no womanish itch to prate.âFarewell. Tech. Nay, do not leave me unresolv'd, good Ballio. Ball. Why, I did set you out in more vile colours Then ever cunning pencill us'd to limbe, Witch, hag, or fury with. Tech. Thou couldst not do't, And live. Ball. I am no ghost, flesh and bloud still. I said you had a prety head of hair, And such as might do service to the State, Made into halters: that you had a brow Hung o're your eyes like flie-flaps: that your eyes Were like two powdring-tubs, either running o're, Or full of standing brine: your cheeks were sunk So low and hollow, they might serve the boyes For cherripits.â Tech. Could Pamphilus heare all this, And not his bloud turn choler? Ball. This? and more. I said your nose was like a hunters horn, And stood so bending up a man might hang His hat upon't: that I mistook the yeare, And alwayes thought it Winter, when I saw Two icicles at your nostrils. Tech. Have I lost All woman, that I can with patience heare My self thus injur'd? Ball. I could beat my self For speaking it, but 'twas to sound him, Madam. I said you had no neck: your chin and shoulders Were so good friends, they would ha' nothing part 'um: I vow'd your breasts, for colour and proportion, Were like a writheld pair of o'reworn footballs: Your waste was slender, but th' ambitious buttock Climbes up so high about, who sees you naked Might sweare you had been born with a vardingal. Tech. I am e'ne frighted with thy strange description. Ball. I left, asham'd and weary: he goes on, There be more chops and wrinckles in her lips, Then on the earth in heat of Dog-dayes: and her teeth Look like an old park-pale: She has a tongue Would make the deaf man blesse his imperfection That frees him from the plague of so much noise: And such a breath (heaven shield us) as out-vies The shambles and bear-garden for a sent. Tech. Was ever such a fury? Ball. For your shoulders, He thinks they were ordain'd to underprop Some beam o'th' Temple, and that's all the use Religion can make of you: Then your feet, For I am loth to give the full description, He vowes they both are cloven. Tech. Had all malice Dwelt in one tongue, it could not scandall more. Is this the man adores me as his saint? And payes his morning orisons at my window Duly as at the Temple? Is there such hypocrisie In loves religion too? Are Venus doves But white dissemblers? Is this that Pamphilus That shakes and trembles at a frown of mine, More then at thunder? I must have more argument Of his apostasie, or suspect you false. Ball. Whose sword is this? Tech. 'Tis his. And this I tied About the hilt, and heard him sweare to fight Under those colours, the most faithfull souldier The fields of Mars or tents of Cupid knew. False men, resigne your arms. Let us go forth Like bands of Amazons: for your valours be Not upright fortitude, but treacherie. Ball. I urg'd him in a language of that boldnesse, As would have fir'd the chillest veins in Thebes, To stand in your defence, or els resigne The fruitlesse steel he wore. He bid me take it. He had not so much of Knight errant in him, To vow himself champion to such a doxie. Tech. Then Love, I shoot thy arrows back again, Return 'um to thy quiver, guide thy arm To wound a breast will say the dart is welcome, And kisse the golden pile. I am possest With a just anger, Pamphilus shall know My scorn as high as his. Ball. Bravely resolv'd. Madam, report not me to Pamphilus Authour of this: for valour should not talk, And fortitude would loose it self in words. Tech. I need no other witnesse then his sword. SCEN. IIII. Ballio, Asotus, Tyndarus, Techmessa. Tyn. Techmessa? never did I understand The sweets of life till now. I will pronounce This for my birth-day. Tech. And this happy minute Has clear'd my soul too of the same disease. Asot. Then do as Tyndarus did, and go with me, Wee'l drink a pottle to Libertie, and another Pottle to th' Asotides, and a pottle to the Tyndarides, And a fourth to the She-philosophers yclepedâTechmessides. SCEN. V. Ballio, Asotus, Tyndarus, Techmessa, Pamphilus. Tyn. Pamphilus, welcome: Shake thy sorrows off, Why in this age of freedome dost thou sit A captiv'd wretch? I do not feel the weight Of clay about me. Am I not all aire? Or of some quicker element? I have purg'd out All that was earth about me, and walk now As free a soul as in the separation. Pam. Brother, if any stream of joy can mix With such a sea of grief as mine, and loose not His native sweetnesse, 'tis a joy for you. But I am all bitternesse. Ball. Now, Asotus, The Comedie begins. Pam. When will my sufferings Make my atonement with my angry goddesse? Do you celestiall sorms retain an anger Eternall as your substance? Tech. O fine hair! An amorous brow, a prety lovely eye, A most delicious cheek, a handsome nose! How Nectar-sweet his lips are? and his teeth, Like two fair ivory pales, inclose a tongue Made up of harmonie. Then he has a chin So full of ravishing dimples, it were pity A beard should overgrow it: and his feet Past all expression comely. Pam. Do not adde Contempt to cruelty. Madam, to insult Upon a prostrate wretch, is harder tyranny Then to have made him so. Tech. And then a shoulder Straight as the pine or cedar. Pam. Courteous death Take wings, thou art too slow. Tech. I could not heare Those precious parts defam'd, but I durst fight In the just quarrell. Tyn. 'Tis a touchy Tiger. How happy am I that have scap't the dens Of these she-wolves! Ball. Now my safetie lies Upon a ticklish pointâa womans secrecie. Madam, my reputation is deare to me. Pam. In what a maze I wander! how my sorrows Run in a labyrinth! Tech. I'le unriddle it. Ball. St, St. The honour of a man at arms. Tech. Then know, thou perjur'd Pamphilus, I have learnt Neglect from thee. Pam. Madam, I am all love: And if the violence of my flame had met With any heart but marble, I had taught it Some spark of my affection. Ball. Now it heats. Tech. No doubt the flame is violent, and must work Upon a breast so capable as mine. Asot. I think Cupid be turn'd jugler. Here's nothing but Hocas pocas, PrÃ¦sto be gon, Come again Jack; and such feats of activitie. Tech. But I must tell you, you are false and perjur'd, Or, what is more, a coward. Tell me, Sir, (To Asotus. For I suppose you of a noblersoul. If you should heare your mistresse by rude tongues Wrong'd in the graces both of minde and beauty, Could you have suffered it? Asot. Madam, were you made From bones of Hercules, and brawn of Atlas, And daughter were to Gargantua great, And wrong my mistresse: you should heare my rage Provoke my blade, and cry, Blade, canst thou sleep In peacefull scabbard? Out thou beast of terrour, And lion-like roar this disdainfull wight To Plutoes shades and ghosts of Erebus. Tech. Yet you, my valiant champion, could resigne This (if you know it) rather then endure The terrour of your own steel, to redeem My bleeding honours. Pam. How am I betray'd, And fall'n into the toyles of treacherie! Give me a man bold as that earth-born race That bid Jove battell, and besieg'd the gods; And if I make him not creep like a worm Upon his belly, and with reverence Lick up the dust you scatter from your shoe, May I for ever loose the light I live in, The sight of you. Tec. I'le try your spirits, Phronesium, (Enter Phrone. &amp; exit rursus, &amp; statim intrat cum gladio Tyn. That bloud of goats should soften Adamant! And poore weak woman with an idle face Should make the souldier to forget his valour, And man his sex! Enter Phronesium. SCEN. VI. Ballio, Tyndarus, Asotus, Techmessa, Pamphilus, Phronesium. Tech. Here's a champion for you. Phron. Come, Sir, this sword be yours, and if you dare Maintain the lists against me, as I fear Your bloud is whey by this time, by your valour You may redeem your honour, and your sword. Asot. This is another Hercules come from the distaff. Phron. If not, I do proclaim thee here, no Knight, But meane to post thee up for a vile varlet, And the disgrace of Chivalrie. Pam. O my shame! Asot. A dainty Lady errant. Ball. A fine piece Of female fortitude. Phron. If this stirre thee not, Thy mistresse is the blemish of her sex, A dirtie filthy huswife. Pam. Would it were not Dishonour now to kill thee! Phron. If your valour Lie in your back-parts, I will make experience (Whether a kick will raise it. Pray go fetch him Some aqua vitÃ¦: for the thought of steel Has put him in a swound: Nothing revive you? Then will I keep thy sword, and hang it up Amongst my busk-points, pins, and curling-irons. Bodkins, and vardingals, a perpetuall trophie Exit Phron. How brave a Knight you are. Pam. Where shall I run And finde a desert, that the foot of man Nere wandred in, to hide from the worlds eyes My shame! S'death, every Page, and sweaty Footman, And sopie chambermaid will point and laugh at me. Tyn. I joy to think that I shall meet Evadne Turn'd on the sudden Moor. How black and vile She will appeare! SCEN. VII. Ballio, Tyndarus, Asotus, Techmessa, Pamphilus, Evadne. Tyn. O heavens! who will not dare Henceforth to scorn your powers, and call sacriledge Merit and pietie? I do not see A hair deform'd, no tooth or nail sustain The brand of her deserved shame. You punish't The Queen of beauty with a mole; but certainly Her perjury hath added to her form, And that the abused gods bribe her with beauty, As th' wrack'd tenant strives to buy the favour Of his imperious Landlord. Evad. Gentle Tyndarus, Load not weak shoulders with too great a burthen. Tyn. O lust! on what bright altars blaze thy flames, While chastity lets her cold fires glow out In deform'd temples, and on ruin'd altars! Tempt me not strumpet, you that have your hirelings, And can with jewels, rings, and other toyes Purchase your journeymen-letchers. Evad. My chaste eare Has been a stranger to such words as these, I have not sinne enough to understand 'um, And wonder where my Tyndarus learnt that language. Tyn. I am turn'd eagle now, and have an eye Dares boldly gaze on that adulterate sunne. I must be short. Who must this ring direct Into your guilty sheets? Evad. I do not know How I should lose that pledge of my Lords love: But 'tis not in the power of any thief To steal away the heart I have vowed yours: And would to all the gods I had kept it there! Asot. Come, blush not bashfull bellipieceâI will meet thee. I ever keep my word with a fair lady. I will requite that jewell with a richer. The glorious heavens arayd in all their starres Shall not outshine thee. Be not, girle, asham'd. These are acquainted with it. I would vex 'um To night with the remembrance of those sports We shall enjoy, then pleasures double rise When both we feed, and they shall Tantalize. Evad. It is not manly in you, Sir, to ruine A virgins fame, with hazard of your own. Asot. Tut, lasse, no matter, we'le be manly anon. Tyn. A fine dissembler! ha! what tumults here? Enter PÃ¦gnium and officers. SCEN. VIII. Ballio, Tyndarus, Asotus, Techmessa, Evadne, Pamphilus, Tyndarus, PÃ¦gnium, and officers. Pag. That's he, I charge you apprehend the villain. 1. Offic. Villain, we reprehend thee. Ball. Slaves, for what? 2. Offic. For an arrant cutpurse: you stole away this little Gentlemans sword; and being done by chance-medly, 'tis flat felony by statute. Pam. I thank thee Innocence. Though earth disclaim Thy title, heaven denies thee not protection. PÃ¦g. Confesse, or I will have thee instantly Hang'd for a signe on thine own post. Ball. Well, villany Thou wilt not thrive. Sir, for 'twas you I wrong'd: I do confesse the sword by which I rais'd So strange a scandal on you, was by me Stoln from your Page, as he delivered letters From you to your Techmessa; and the plot Was fashion'd by her mother, though ill fortune Made me th' unlucky instrument. Asot. Cursed Tutour, Thou hast read nothing to me worth the learning, But the high-way to th' gallows. There shall we Hang up like vermine. Little did I think To make the women weep and sob to see Th' untimely end of two such proper men. This mouth was never made to stand awry, And sure my neck was long enough before. Lady, upon my humbled knees I beg Pardon for faults committed, I acknowledge That striving with fellonious intent To steal a kisse or two from your sweet lips, From your sweet care I stole a ring away. PÃ¦g. For which your sweet neck must endure the halter. Tyn. I am again thy servant, mighty love! O my Evadne, how shall I appeare So bold as but to plead in mine own cause? It is so foul that none can seal my pardon, But you that should condemne me. Evad. Sir, you know The power I have is yours: be your own judge, And seal your pardon here. Tyn. 'Tis double life Granted by such a seal. Tech. What punishment Shall we inflict on these? Asot. Gentle Ladie, E'ne what you please,âbut hanging,âthat's a death My enemies will hit me in the teeth with. Besides, it makes a man look like a Cat When she cries mew. Ball. I'le bark and bite awhile Before the dogs death choak me. Asot. Pray dismisse This pack of hounds: and since we both are guilty, Let us bestow on one anothers shoulders The good and wholsome counsell of a cudgell. PÃ¦g. Pray let me intercede. Asot. Thanks, prety little Gentleman. Tyn. Officers, you are discharged. Asot. Are the madde dogs gone? Exeunt officers. Come Tutour, I must read awhile to you Under correction.âNot so hard, good Tutour. Tyn. Enough. Asot. Nay, one bout I beseech you more To make up satisfaction. Ball. Well for this I'le have one engine more, my bad intents Mend not, but gather strength by punishments. Tyn. Your satisfaction now is full and ample. Asot. Nay, we must have the health i'th' crabtree-cup too: One to th' Tyndarides, another to th' Asotides, And one, my deare instructour, to the Techmessides. Pam. Nay, now your penance doth exceed your crime. Asot. Say you so? nay, then here's a health to the Pamphilides too: And for his noble sake, to the Evadnides, And all Philosophy sects what e're they be. Evad. Your justice to your selves is too severe. Asot. Then I ha' done: farewell, and hearty thanks. But, Tutour, stay, this little Gentleman Has been forgot:âPray, Sir, what may I call you? PÃ¦g. My name is PÃ¦gnium.â Asot. I were most unthankfull To passe o're you.âTo the PÃ¦gniades, Tutour: You have brought us to a fair passe, Tutour. Ball. Tush, 'Twas but to exercise your passive valour. Asot. Your passive valour? give me your active valour: I do not like your black and blue valour, When bones shall ake with magnanimity. Exeunt Asot. Ball. PÃ¦g. SCEN. IX. Tyndarus, Pamphilus, Evadne, Techmessa. Tyn. Brother, I finde my soul a troubled sea Whose billows are not fully quieted, Although the storm be over. Therefore, Pamphilus, By the same wombe that bred us, and the breasts Of our dead mother Lalage, I conjure thee, With all the charms that love can teach thee, Assault Evadnies faith: if thou report her Constant, I end my jealousie: if frail, The torrent of my love shall bend his course To finde some other chanel. Pam. By that love That made us twins, though born at severall births, That grew along with us in height and strength, I will be true. Farewell. Tyn. Be sudden, Pamphilus. Exit Tyn. Evad. Me thinks this should confirm you. Tech. That he was not Guilty of this, acquits him not of all: To prove a man free from an act of theft, Assoils him not of murder. No, no, sister, Tempt him with kisses, and what other dalliance Craft and indulgent nature hath taught woman To raise hot youth to appetite; if he yeeld not, I will put off distrust. I do not know Whom I durst trust but you. Evad. Though mine own love Finde me enough of businesse, yet in hope That you will second me in my occasions, I undertake the task. Tech. Take heed Evadne, Lest while you counterfeit a flame, you kindle A reall fire.âI dare not be too confident. Hence will I closely pry into their actions, And overheare their language; for if my sister See with my eyes, she cannot choose but love him In the same height with me. SCEN. X. Pamphilus, Evadne, Techmessa in insidiis. Pam. It grieves me that a Lady of your worth, Young, soft, and active as the spring, the starre And glory of our nation, should be prodigall Of your affections, and misplace your love On a regardlesse boy. Evad. Sir, the same pitie I must return on you. Were I a man Whom all the Ladies might grow rivals for (As lesse you cannot be) I would not lose My service to a Mistresse of so coy And proud an humour:âTrue, she is my sister, But the same wombe produces severall natures. I should have entertain'd so great a blessing With greater thankfulnesse. Pam. That my starres should be So crosse unto my happinesse! Evad. And my fate So cruell to me! Pam. Sweet, it is in us To turn the wheel of Fortune; she's a goddesse That has no deity where discretion reignes. Evad. But shall I wrong my sister? Pam. Do not I Give just exchange, and lose a brother for her? Our sufferings have been equall, and their prides. They must be equall necks that can draw even In the same yoke. Evad. I have observ'd, the chariot Of the great Cyprian Queen links not together The dove with sparrows; but the turtle joynes With turtles, and the sparrow has his mate. Pam. See if one softnesse kisse not in our lips. Evad. One lip not meets the other with more sympathy, Then yours met mine. Pam. Let's make the second triall. SCEN. XI. Techmessa, Pamphilus, Evadne. Tech. I can endure no longer,âGentle sister. Evad. I cannot blame your jealousie: for I findeâ Tech. Too much of sweetnesse in his amorous lips. There is no tie in nature, faith in bloud Is but a thing that should be. Brothers, sisters, Fathers, and mothers are but specious names Of love and dutie: you and I have been But guests in the same wombe, that at first meeting Change kinde and friendly language, and next morning Fall out before they part, or at least ride Contrary rodes. Evad. Will you then misconster The service I perform'd at your request? Tech. Henceforth I'le set the Kite to keep my chickens, And make the Wolf my shepheard. SCEN. XII. Evadne, Techmessa, Pamphilus, Tyndarus. Tyn. Pamphilus, how is't? Pam. I know not how to answer thee. She met me with more courtship then I tender'd. Tech. Sir we are both abus'd, and the same wombe That gave us life was fruitfull to our ruine. Your traitour weares the mask call'd Brother: mine As cunning a disguise, the name of Sister. These eyes are witnesse that descried 'um kissing Closer then cockles, and in lustfull twines Outbid the ivy, or the circling arms Of winding vines. Their hot embraces met So neare, and folded in so close a knot, As if they would incorporate, and grow one. Tyn. Then farewell all respect of bloud and friendship, I do pronounce thee stranger. If there can be Valour in treachery, put thy trust in steel As I do, not in brothers.âDraw, or die. Pam. Brother. Tyn. I hate the name, it is a word Whets my just anger to a sharper edge. Pam. Heare me. Tyn. I will no pleading but the sword. Wert thou protected by Apollo's temple, Or hadst the altar for security, Religion should not binde me from thy death. Couldst thou retreat into my mothers wombe, There my revenge should finde thee. I am sudden, And talk is tedious. Pam. Beare me witnesse heaven, This action is unwilling. SCEN. XIII. Pamphilus, Tyndarus, Techmessa, Evadne, Chremylus, Dypsas. Chrem. Put up for shame those rude unhallowed blades, And let not rash opinion of a valour Perswade you to be Parricides. Pray remember You thirst but your own bloud. He that o'recomes Loses the one half of himself. Tynd. Deare Chremylus, The reverence to your age hath tied my hands: But were my threed of life measur'd by his, I'de cut it off, though we both fell together; That my incensed soul might follow his, And to eternity prosecute my revenge. Pam. Brother, at your intreaty I adventured To court Evadne; and because I found her Against my minde, too easie to my suit, Your rage falls heavie on me. Tech. On my knees I beg, deare father, cloyster me in darknesse, Or send me to the desert to converse With nothing but a wildernesse, or expose me To the cold mercy of the winde and wave, So you will free me from the company Of a false sister. Evad. Sir, with much perswasion She wrought on me to personate a love To Pamphilus, to finde if I could stagger The faith he vow'd to her. This have I done, And this so much hath moved her. Chrem. Here you see The fruits of rashnesse. Do you finde your errour? But the foul spring from whence these bitter streams Had their first head, I fear, is from you Dypsas. Dyp. I will no more denie it, I have sown Those seeds of doubt, wishing to see dissension Ripe for the sickleâFor what cause I now Forbeare to speakâbut henceforth I will strive To cleare those jealousies, and conclude their loves In a blest nuptiall. Tyn. O how frail is man! One Sunny day the exhalation reares Into a cloud: at night it falls in teares. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS III. SCEN. I. Dypsas, Tyndarus. Tyn. If it be not immodesty to demaund So bold a question; I would be resolv'd Of one doubt yet. Dyps. Speak boldly, by all holinesse My answer shall be true. Tyn. When you were young, And lively appetite revelled in your bloud, Did you not finde rebellion in your veins? Did not the same embraces tedious grow? And cause a longing in your thoughts to taste Varieties of men? Dyps. I blush, I cannot answer With a deniall; not a proper Gentleman But forc'd my goatish eye to follow him: And when I had survey'd his parts, I would With any losse of honour, wealth, and friendship, Have bought him to my bed: and truely, Sir, 'Twas cheap at any rate. Tyn. Steel'd impudence! What fruit can I expect the bough should beare That grows from such a stock? Dyps. I had of late A moneths minde Sir to you: Y'ave the right make To please a Lady. Tyn. Sure this old piece of lust When she is dead will make her grave a brothell, And tempt the worms to adulterate her carcasse. Dyps. And that's the reason I have cross'd my daughter To further mine own love. Pity me, Sir, For though the fewel's spent, there is a spark Rak'd up ith' embers.âBut I now desist. Please you to go to Ballios house, my daughter Shall meet you thereâI hope that out of duty She will not grutch her mother a good turn When she is marriedânow and then. Tyn. Is there no house To meet at, but this Ballios? Is Evadne Acquainted there? is that the rendevous Of her hot meetings?âyet I still suspect This womans malice to her childe not lost. I will bestow some time, and go to see The strange event of this dark mysterie. Exit Tyndarus. SCEN. II. Dypsas, Ballio. Dyps. Ballio. Ball. Madam. Dyps. See your house be stor'd With the deboisest Rorers in the city Let every room be fill'd with noise and quarrelling, For Tyndarus is to meet Evadne there. You guesse the rest; if not, this purse of gold Better inform you. Exit Dypsas. Ball. Most celestiall Lady, Though I have practised villany from my cradle And from my dugge suckt mischief more then milk, This fury still out-does me.âI am vext, Vext to the heart to see a silly woman Carry more devils in her then my self. And yet I love theeâthou she-rogue, I love thee. Had I but such a wife, what a fine brood Of toads could I beget! SCEN. III. Ballio, Simo. Ball. Here comes my mole, The sonne of earth, that digs his mothers entrals To turn up treasure for his boy and me. That with industrious eyes searches to hell To buy us heaven on earth. Welcome, welcome Thou age of gold: how do the bags at home? Are all the chests in health? thrives the purse still? And sayes it to the talents, Multiply? Sim. Thanks to my providence like a swarm! Wealth falls Not in small drops upon me, (as at first) But like a torrent overthrows the bank As it would threat a deluge. Were it not pity My boy should not invent sluces enow To drain the copious stream. Ball. A thousand pities! That you should lose the fruits of so much care. Sim. True Ballio, true. Ball. Trust me, what art can do Shall not be wanting. Sim. I'le not be ungratefull. It lies in you to turn these silver hairs To a fresh black again, and by one favour Cut fortie yeares away from the gray summe. Ball. I had rather cut off all, and be our own carvers:âAside Sir, if I had Medea's charms to boyl An aged lambe in some inchaunted caldron Till he start up a lambe, I would recall Your youth, and make you like the aged snake Cast off this wrinckled skin, and skip up fresh As at fifteen. Sim. All this you may and more. If you will place me where I may unseen Make my eye witnesse of my sonnes delight, I shall enjoy the pleasures by beholding 'um. Ball. True Sir, you know he's but your second self, The same you might have been at one and twenty: The blisse is both's alike. Sim. Most Philosophicall! Ball. Place your self there. Sim.

Come forth my Rascalls: Let the thriving Lord Confine his family unto half a man I cleept aâPage. Our honour be attended With men of arts and arms. Captains and Poets Shall with the Bilbow blade and Gray goose quill Grace our RetinueâAnd when we grow surly, Valour and wit fall prostrate at our frown; Crouch imps of Mars, and frogs of Helicon. Sim. How they adore him! and the perilous wagge Becomes his state: To see what wealth can do, To those that have the blessing how to spend it! Ball. Your blessing was the wealth: the art of spending He had from me. Sim. Once more I give thee thanks. Thras. Who dares offend thee, Lord of fortitude, And not pay homage to thy potent toe, Shall be a morsell for the dogs. Asot. Stoutly deliver'd, My brave ThrasymachusâThou for this shalt feed. I will not suffer valour to grow lean, And march like famine. I have seen an army Of such a meagre troop, such thin-chapt starvelings, Their barking stomacks hardly could refrain From swallowing up the foe, ere they had slain him. Hyper. If thou command our service, we will die Dull earth with crimson, till the teares of orphanes, Widows and mothers wash it white again: Wee'le strow thy walks with legs, and arms, and thighes, And pay thee tribute thousand heads a day, Fresh bleeding from the trunck: and panting hearts Not dead shall leap in thy victorious paw. Asot. Then say thou too to HungerâFriend adieu! Ballio condemne a bagge, let trash away, See'um both arm'd in scarlet cap-a-pea, Strike top-sail, men of warre. Ball. We must divide: We that serve great men have no other shifts To thrive our selves but guelding our Lords guifts. Sim. Now I am rich indeed, this is true treasure. Asot. Ha! has Melpomene ta'ne cold of late, That you are silent, my Parnassian beagles? Is Clio dumbe? or has Apollos Jewes-trump By sad disaster lost her melodious tongue? ChÃ¦r. Your praise all tongues desire to speak: but some, Nay all I fear, for want of art grow dumbe: The harp of Orpheus blushes for to sing, And sweet Amphions voice hath crack't a string. Asot. A witty solecisme reward the errour! harp and sing, voice and string. Bom. Give me a breath of thunder, let me speak Sonorous accents, till their clamours break Rocks with the noise obstreperous. I will warble Such bounsing notes shall cleave obdurate marble Upon mount Caucasus heavens knocking head, Boreas shall blow my trumpet, till I spread Thy fame, grand Patron of the thrice three sisters, Till envies eares shall heare it and have blisters. Asot. O rare close, a high sublime conceit! For this I'le sheath thee in a new serge scabbard Blade of the fount Pegasean. Sim. What an honour Will our bloud come to!âI have satisfied For all the Orphanes, Widows, and what others My sacred hunger hath devour'd. Asot. Ballio Blesse him with twentie drachmesâyet forbeare: Money may spoyl his Poetry. Give's some wine, Here is a whetstone both for wit and valour. A health to all my beads-men of the sword. Thr. Hyp. This will ingage the men of arms to fight. Asot. This to the Muses, and their threed-bare tribe. Char. Bom. Thou dost ingage the learned troops to write. Asot. Go sonnes of Mars, with young Apollos brood, And usher in my Venus: wine hath warm'd My bloud, and wak'd it to an itch of sporting. (Exeunt Bom. Hyp. ChÃ¦r. Thr. for to fetch in Phr. Asot, the while is putting on his armour. Ball. Some twentie ages hence 'twill be a question Which of the two the world will reverence more: You for a thriving father, or Asotus So liberall a sonne. Sim. Good, Ballio, good: But which will they preferre? Ball. They cannot, Sir, But most admire your fist, which grip'd so much That made his hand so open. Sim. Gracious starres, How blest shall I be twentie ages hence! Some twentie ages hence. Ball. You shall be call'd A doting Coxcombe twentie ages hence. SCEN. III. ChÃ¦rilus, Bomolochus before personating 2 Mercuries, Phrine in an antique robe and coronet guarded in by Hyperbolus and Thrasimachus. Asot. How bright and glorious are the beams my starre Darts from her eye! Lead up, my Queen of beauty! But in a softer march, sound a retreat: Lead on again, I'le meet her in that state The god of warre puts on, when he salutes The Cyprian Queenâthese that were once the postures Of horrid battells, are become the muster Of love and beauty. Say sweet brace of Mercuries, Is she th'âOlympique or the Paphian goddesse? Ball. Where are you Sir, where are you? Sim. In Elysium, in Elysium. ChÃ¦r. This is no goddesse of th'âOlympique hall Bom. Nor may you her of Neptunes issue call. ChÃ¦r. For she nor Siren is nor Amphitrite. Bom. Nor wood-nymph that in forrest takes delight. ChÃ¦r. Nor is she Muse. Bom. Nor Grace. ChÃ¦r. Nor is she one of these That haunt the springs the beauteous Naiades. Bom. Nor Flora, Lady of the field is she. ChÃ¦r. Nor bright Pomona the Orchard's deitie. Bom. No, she is none of these. ChÃ¦r. Oh then prepare To heare her blessed name. Both. 'Tis Phryne fair. Asot. Phryne the fair? Oh peace! if this be she, Go forth, and sing the world a lullabie. For thy deare sake in whom is all delight, I will no more the trembling nations fright With bellowing drummes, and grones of slaughter'd men. My father brings the golden age again. Phryn. Pardon me, dreadful deitie of warre, 'Twas love of you that forc'd me from my sphere, And made me leave my Orbe without her influence, To meet you in the fury of the fight Sweating with rage, and reeking in the bloud Of wretches sacrific'd to the Stygian floud. Asot. Come forth thou horrid instrument of death. Ball. Do you heare him, Sir? Sim. I, to my comfort Ballio. Asot. I will dispeople earth, and drown the world In crimson flouds, and purple deluges. The old, the young, the weak, the lusty wight, Souldiers and scholars, fair and foul together, Men, women, children, infants, all shall die. I will have none survive that shall have left Above one eye, three quarters of a face, And half a nose. I will carve legs and arms As at a feast. Henceforth to all posteritie Mankinde shall walk on crutches. Phryn. Cruell Mars! Let the conjunction of my milder starre Temper the too malignant force of thine. The drumme, the fife, and trumpet shall be turn'd To lutes, and citherns. We will drink in helmets, And cause the souldier turn his blade to knives To conquer capons, and the stubble goose: No weapons in the age to come be known, But sword of Bacon, and the shield of Brawn. Daigne me a kisse, great Warriour. Asot. Hogsheads of Nectar Are treasur'd in the warehouse of her worth. That kisse hath ransom'd thousands from the grave. Phryn. Let me redeem more thousands with a second. Asot. Rage melts away. I pardon half the world. Phryn. O let me kisse away all rigour from thee. Asot. Live mortalls, live. Death has no more to do. And yet me thinks a little rigour's left. Phryn. Thus shall it vanish. Asot. Vanish rigour, vanish. Harnesse the lions, make my chariot ready: Venus and I will ride. Phryn. How? drawn by lions? Asot. I, thou shalt kisse 'um till their rigour vanish (As mine has) into aire. I will have these play With Ounces, Tigers, and the Panthers whelp, As with a Squirrel. Beares shall wait on thee, And spotted Leopards shall thy Monkies be. Sit down my Queen, and let us quaff a bowl: Seest thou, my Phryne, what a fair retinue I have provided thee? These for thy defence 'Gainst any Lady rivals thee in beauty. And these on all occasions shall vent forth Swelling Encomiums.âSay Bomolochus, How sings my Mistresse? Bom. The Grashopper chaunts not his Autumne quite So sweet, nor Cricket by the chimney fire. Asot. They'le make thee any thing. Thou art already Cricket and Grashopper.âChÃ¦rilus, how does she dance? ChÃ¦r. Have you beheld the little sable beast Clad in an Ebon mantle, hight a flea, Whose supple joynts so nimbly skip and caper From hemme to sleeve, from sleeve to hemme again, Dancing a measure o're a Ladies smock, With motion quick, and courtly equipage? So trips fair Phryne o're the flowry stage. Asot. Now thou art a flea.âHow snorts she as she sleeps! Bom. Zephyrus breaths not with a sweeter gale Through a grove of sycomore. The soft spring Chides not the pebles that disturb his course With sweeter murmure. Let Amphions lute (That built our Theban walls) be henceforth mute. Orpheus shall break his harp, and silent be, The reed of Pan, and pipe of Mercury: Yea, though the spheres be dumbe, I care not for't: No musick such as her melodious snort. Asot. Melodious snort! With what decorum spits she! ChÃ¦r. Like the sweet gummes that from Electar trees Distill, or honey of the labouring bees: Like morning dew that in a pleasant showre Drops pearls into the bosome of a flowre; Cupid with acorn cups close by her sits, To snatch away the Nectar that she spits. Asot. Ballio, present me with the crowns of laurell. Thus I drop wine the best of Helicon On your learn'd heads, and crown you thus with bayes. Rise Poets laureat both! Favour Apollo! Both. The Muses and Asotus be propitious! Asot. I will not have you henceforth sneak to Taverns. And peep like fidlers into Gentlemens rooms, To shark for wine and radishes: nor Ile sentinell At Ordinaries, nor take up at playes Some novice for a supper: you shall deal No more in ballads to bewail an execution In lamentable rythmes: nor beg in Elegies: Nor counterfeit a sicknesse to draw in A contribution: nor work journey-work Under some play-house post, that deals in Wit by retail: nor shall you task your brains To grace a Burgesse new post with a Rebus: Or furnish a young suitour with an Anagram Upon his mistresse name: nor studie posies For rings and bracelets.âInjure not the bough Of Daphne: know that you are laureat now. Ball. How like you this discourse? Sim. Excellent well. It is a handsome lasse. If I were young (As I am not decrepit) I would give A talent for a kisse. Phryn. Come beauteous Mars, I'le kembe thy hair smooth as the ravens feather, And weave those stubborn locks to amorous bracelets; Then call a livelier red into thy face, And soften with a kisse thy rugged lips. I must not have this beard so rudely grow, But with my needle I will set each hair In decent order, as you rank your squadrons. Asot. Here's a full bowl to beauteous Phrynes health. What durst thou do, Thrasymachus, to the man That should deny it? Thras. Dissect him into atomes. Hyper. I durst do more for beauteous Phrynes sake. Thras. What, more then I? Hyperbolus, thou art mortall. Hyper. Yeeld, or I see a breakfast for the crows. Thras. Death to my lungs, I spit upon thy fame. Hyper. Then with my steel I whip thy rash contempt. Asot. Brawling you mastives.âKeep the peace at home And joyn your forces 'gainst the common foe. Phryn. You sha'nt be angry: by this kisse you sha' not. Asot. I will, unlesse you swear again. Phryn. You sha'not. Sim. Ah, Ballio! Age has made me dry as tinder, And I have taken fire. I burn, I burn. The spark rak'd up in ashes is broke forth, And will consume me, Ballio. Ball. What's the matter? Sim. Love, cruel love. I must enjoy that lady What ever price it cost me. Ball. Your sonnes mistresse? Sim. Sonne, or not sonne.âLet this intreat, and this. Ball. This will perswade. I must remove your sonne, His fury else will surely stand 'twixt us And our designes.âOld letcher, I will fit you, And geld your bags for this. You shall be milk'd, Emptied, and pumpt. Spunge, we will squeeze you spunge, And send you to suck more.âInvincible Mars. Asot. What sayes the governour of our younger yeares? Ball. You have worn this plot of Mars too stale already. O shift your self into all shapes of love. Women are taken with varietie. What think you of Oberon the king of Fayries? I know 'twill strike her fancie. Asot. Businesse calls. Drink on, for our return shall sudden be. SCEN. VI. Ballio, Simo, Thrasymachus, Hyperbolus, ChÃ¦rilus, Bomolochus, Phryne. Ball. Phryne, here is a boy of wealth, my girle, The golden bull that got this golden calf Deeply in love with thee. Phryn. Let me alone, I'le fleece him.â Ball. Melt him, Phryne, melt him: We must not leave this mine till we have found The largenesse of the vein.âSuck like an horse-leach. Come, Sir, and boldly enter: I have choak't out An easie path to tread in; 'twill direct you To your wished journeys end, and lodge you safe In her soft arms. Sim. Thou art my better Angel. Wilt thou eat gold, drink gold, lie in gold, I have it for thee. Old men are twice children, And so was I, but I am grown again Up to right man.âThou shalt be my Tutour too. Is there no stools, or tables? Ball. What to doe? Sim. I would vault over them, to shew the strength And courage of my back. Ball. Strike boldly in, Sir. Sim. Save you, Gentlemen. If you want gold, here's for you. Give me some wine: Mistresse, a health to you: Pledge me, and spice the cup with these and these. Thou shalt have better gowns. Thras. A brave old boy. Hyper. There's mettall in him. ChÃ¦r. I will sing thy praise In lines heroick. Bom. I will tune my lyre, And chaunt an ode that shall eternize thee. Phryn. Of what a sweet aspect! how lovely look'd Is this fine Gentleman!âI hope you know It is in Thebes the custome to salute Fair ladies with a kisse.â Sim. She is enamour'd. Sure I am younger then I thought my self. Fair Lady, health and wealth attend thee. Phryn. Good Sir, another kisse: you have a breath Compos'd of odours. Sim. Buy thee toyes with this: I'le send thee more. Phryn. How ravishing is his face? Sim. That I should have so ravishing a face, And never know it!âMiser that I was! I will go home and buy a looking glasse, To be acquainted with my parts hereafter. Phryn. Come, lie thee down by me; here we will sit. How comely are these silver hairs? This hand Is e'ne as right to my own minde, as if I had the making of it. Let me throw My arms about thee. Ball. How the burre cleaves to him! Sim. This remnant of my age will make amends For all the time that I have spent in care. Phryn. Give me thy hand. How smooth a palm he has! How with a touch it melts! Ball. The rogue abuses him With his greasie fists. Phryn. Let us score kisses up On one anothers lips. Thou shalt not speak, But I will suck thy words e're they have felt The open aire.â Sim. That I should live so long, And ignorant of such a wealth as this! SCEN. VII. Simo, Thrasymachus, Hyperbolus, ChÃ¦rilus, Bomolochus, Phryne, Asotus. Asot. Now am I Oberon prince of Fairy land, And Phryne shall be Mab my Empresse fair: My souldiers two I'le instantly transform To Will-with-a-wisp, and Robin-goodfellow, And make my brace of Poets transmigrate Into Pigwiggin and Sir Peppercorn. It were a pretty whimsy now to counterfeit That I were jealous of my Phrynes love. The humour would be excellent, and become me Better then either Tyndarus or Techmessa. Thus will I walk as one in deadly dumps. Sim. When shall we marry? Phryn. I can hardly stay Till morning. Asot. O what Fury shot A viper through my soul! Here Love with twenty bows And twenty thousand arrows layes his siege To my poore heart.âO Phryne, Phryne! I have no cause why to suspect thy love. But if all this be cunning, as who knows! Away foul sinne. O eyes, what mischief do you see! Ball. O, I could burst with laughter. Here will be A prety scene of mirth. Sim. Thou dost not love me. My boy Asotus, my young sprightly boy Has stoln thy heart away. Phryn. He? a poore mushrum! Your boy? I should have guess'd him for your father. He has a skin as wrinckled as a Tortoyse. I have mista'ne him often for a hedge-hog Crept out on's skin. Pray keep the fool at home. Asot. Patience go live with cuckolds. I defie thee. Villain, rogue, traitour, do not touch my deare So to unsanctifie her tender skin, Nor cast a goatish eye upon a hair, To make that little threed of gold profaned, Or gaze but on her shoe-string that springs up A reall rose, from vertue of her foot, To blast the odours: grim-fac'd death shall hurry thee To Styx, Cocytus, and fell Phlegeton. Sim. Asotus, good Asotus, I am thy father. Asot. I no Asotus am, nor thou my fire, But angry and incensed Oberon. Sim. All that I have is thine, though I could vie For every silver hair upon my head A piece in gold.â Asot. I should send you to the barbours. Sim. All, all is thine: let me but share A little in thy pleasures: onely relish The sweetnesse of 'um. Asot. No, I will not have Two spenders in a house. Go you and revell, I will go home and live a drudges life, As you ha' done, to scrape up pelf together: And then forsweare all Tutours, Souldiers, Poets, Women, and wine. I will forget to eat, And starve my self to the bignesse of a polecat. I will disclaim his faith that can beleeve There is a Taverne, or a Religious place For holy Nunnes that vow incontinence, And have their beads to sin by.âGet you home. You kisse a Gentlewoman to endanger Your chattering teeth?âGo, you have done your share In getting me: to furnish the next age Must be my province. Go, look you to yours. Lie with your mustie bags, and get more gold. S'lid, anger me, and I'le turn drudge for certain. Sim. Asotus, good Asotus pardon me. Asot. I wonder you are not asham'd to ask pardon. Sim. It was the dotage of my age, Asotus. Asot. Who bid you live untill this age of dotage? Sim. I will abjure all pleasures but in thee. Asot. This something qualifies. Sim. It shall be my sport To maintain thine. Thou shalt eat for both, And drink for both.â Asot. Good: this will qualifie more. Sim. And here I promise thee to make a joynture Of half the land I have to this fair Lady. Asot. This qualifies all. You have your pardon, Sir! But heare you, Sir, it must be paid for too. To morrow Mab I thee mine Empresse crown. Ball. All friends. A merry cup go round. What? Captains And Poets here, and leave the sack for flies? SCEN. VIII. Ballio, Asotus, Phryne, Simo, Thrasimachus, Hyperb. ChÃ¦rilus, Bomolochus, Tyndarus. Hyp. Thrasimachus, a whole one. Thras. Done: I'le pledge thee Though 'twere a deluge.âBy my steel you have left Enough to drown an island, ChÃ¦rilus. ChÃ¦r. And 'twere the famous fount of Hyppocrene, I'de quaffe it off all, though the great Apollo And all the Muses died for thirst, Bomolochus. Bom. Come boy, as deep as is Pamassus high. Tyn. What nurserie of sinne is this? what temple Of lust and riot? Was this place alone Thought a fit witnesse for the knitting up Chaste and religious love? Deeds dark as hell, Incest and murder might be acted here. The holy god of Marriage never lighted His sacred torch at so profane a den. It is a cage for schreetch-owls, bats, and ravens, For crows and kites, and such like birds of prey. But the chaste turtle, the indulgent pelican, And pious stork, flie hence as from infection. Evadne meet me here? Is she a parcell Of the damn'd family? Are there such white devils Among their Succuba's? No, thou art wrong'd, Evadne: And there be some that scatter snakes amongst us, Have stung too deep already. SCEN. IX. Ballio, Asotus, ChÃ¦rilus, Simo, Hyperbolus, Thrasimachus, Tyndarus, Evadne. Tyn. Blesse me eyes! My troubled fancie fools me. I am lost In a distracted dream. It is not she. Awake thee Tyndarus: what strange sleeps are these! Me thinks I am in hell, and yet behold A glorious Angel there. Or have these devils Broke into Paradise! for the place is such, She blesses with her presence.âMeere contradictions, ChimÃ¦ras, of a restlesse brain. Evad. Diana, And whatsoever Goddesse else protects Untouch'd virginity, shield me with your powers. To what a wildernesse have my wandring steps Betray'd me! sure this cannot be a place To meet my Tyndarus in. Tyn. 'Tis Evadne, 'Tis the fair-foul Evadne. Now my sword, That hadst a good edge to defend this woman, Go send her soul into another mansion Black as it self. It is too foul a tenant For this fair palace. Stay yet, too forward steel, Take her incircled in her stallions arms, And kill two sinnes together.âLet 'um be At hell to beare the punishment of lust E're it be fully acted. Evad. What strange fancies My maiden fears present me! Why, I know not: But this suspicion seldome bodeth good. Thras. A handsome Bona Roba, and my prize. Hyper. I do deny't, she's my monopoly. ChÃ¦r. Perchance she may one of the Muses be, And then claim I a share for Poetrie. Evad. If ever silly lambe thus stray'd before Into a flock of wolves; or harmlesse dove Not onely made the prey, but the contention Of ravenous eagles; such poore soul am I. Thras. Give me a busse, my girle. Evad. If there be here A Gentleman in whom there lives a spark Of vertue not yet out; I do beseech him, By all the ashes of his ancestours, And by the constant love he beares his mistresse, To rescue innocence and virginity From these base monsters. I for him will pay A thousand prayers a morning, all as pure And free from earthly thought, as e're found passage Through the strict gate of heav'n. Tyn. That's a task for me. Away fowl ravishers, I will teach my sword Justice to punish you. Such a troup of Harpyes To force a Ladies honour! I will quench With your own bloud the rage of that hot lust That spurr'd you on to base and bold attempts. Asot. Flie, Phryne, flie, for dangers do surround. Sim. This is a pleasure that I care not for. Exeunt. SCEN. X. Tyndarus, Evadne. Tyn. Lady be safe. Evad. Sir, may this favour done An injur'd maid call blessings on your head In plenteous showres! Tyn. This courtesie deserves Some fair requitall. Evad. May plum'd victory Wait on your sword: and if you have a mistresse, May she be fair as lilies, and as chaste As the sweet morning dew that loads the heads Of drooping flowres: may you have fair children To propagate your vertues to posterity And blesse succeeding times.â Tyn. Heaven be not deaf! Evad. May you and plenty never live asunder. Peace make your bed,âandâ Tyn. Prayer is cheap reward. And nothing now bought at a rate so easie As that same highway ware.âHeaven blesse your worship. In plain words Lady (I can use no language But what is blunt) I must do what they would ha' done. Evad. Call back your words, and lose not that reward Heaven is ingag'd to pay you. Tyn. Come: no circumstance. Your answer? quick. Evad. I beg it on my knees, Have a respect to your own soul, that sinks In this dishonour, Sir, as deep as mine. Tyn. You are discourteous, Lady! Evad. Let these teares Plead for me: did you rescue me from theeves, To rob me of the jewell you preserv'd? Tyn. Why do I trifle time away in begging That may command.âProud Damsel, I will force thee. Evad. I thank thee blest occasion:âNow I dare She snatches a stilletto out of his pocket. Defy thee devil: here is that shall keep My chastity secure, and arm a maid, To scorn your strength. Tyn. Be not too masculine, Lady. Evad. Stand off, or I will search my heart with this, And force my bloud a passage, that in anger Shall flie into thy face, and tell thee boldly Thou art a villain. Tyn. Incomparable Lady! By all those powers that the blest-men adore, And the worst fear, I have no black designe Upon your honour; onely as a souldier I did desire to prove whether my sword Had a deserving cause: I would be loth To quarrell for light ware. Now I have found you Full weight, I'le weare his life upon my point That injures so much goodnesse. Evad. You speak honour. Tyn. Blest be this minute, sanctifie it, Time, 'Bove all thy calendar. Now I finde her gold. This touchstone gives her perfect. The discovery Of ne're found kingdomes, where the plow turns up Rich oare in every furrow, is to this A poore successe. Now all my doubts are clear'd, And I dare boldly say, Be happy Tyndarus! SCEN. II. Tyndarus, Evadne, Pamphilus. Pam. Great Queen of love, sure when the labouring sea Did bring forth thee, before she was deliver'd; Her violent throws had rais'd a thousand storms. Yet now, I hope after so many wrecks That I have suffer'd in thy troubled waves, Thou now wilt land me safe. Tyn. Pamphilus here? He comes to meet Evadne. This is their house Of toleration. She had spied me out Through my disguise: and with what studied art, What cunning language, how well acted gesture, How much of that unbounded store of teares She wrought on my credulity! The Fox, HyÃ¦na, Crocodile, and all beasts of craft, Have been distill'd to make one woman up. Exit. Evad. And has he left me in this dragons den! A spoil to rapine! what defence, poore maid, Hast thou against these wilde and salvage beasts? My starres were cruell: If you be courteous eyes, Weep me a floud of teares, and drown me in't, And be Physicians to my sorrows now, That have too long been Heraulds of my grief. My thread of life has hitherto drawn out More woes then minutes. Pam. Health to the fair Evadne. Evad. Is any left so courteous to wish health To the distress'd Evadne? Pamphilus? Pam. Is my Techmessa here? Evad. Now all the Gods Preserve her hence, there is in hell more safety Among the FuriesâMischief built this house For all her family. Gentle Pamphilus, See me delivered from this jayl, this dungeon, This horrid vault of lust. SCEN. XII. Pamphilus, Tyndarus, Techmessa, Evadne. Pam. Take comfort, Lady. Your honour stands safe on his guard, while I Can use a sword. Evad. You have confirmed me, Sir. Tyn. How close they winde, like glutinous snakes ingendring, Tech. Well sister, I shall study to requite This courteous treachery. Evad. Pamphilus, in me All starres conspire to make affliction perfect. Pam. Wait on heavens pleasure, Madam: such a one The heavens ne're made for misery, they but give you These crosses as sharp sauce to whet your appetite For some choice banquet. Or they mean to lead you Through a vault dark and obscure as hell, To make your paradise a sweeter prospect. âThus I feed Others with hopes, while mine own wounds do bleed. Exeunt Evadne, Pamphilus. SCEN. XIII. Tyndarus, Techmessa. Tech. Why should we toil thus in an endlesse search Of what we now behold?âLet us grow wise. I loath false Pamphilusâyet I could have lov'd him: And if he were but faithfull, could do still. Tyn. Sure were Evadne false, yet Pamphilus Would not be made the instrument to wrong me. Or suppose Pamphilus were a treacherous brother; Me thinks Evadne should be kinder to me. Techmessa joyn with me in one search more, Ballio. SCEN. XIIII. Tyndarus, Techmessa, Ballio, Asotus. Tyn. O Ballio, 'tis in you and deare Asotus To make two wretches happy. Asot. Then be happy. Tyn. 'Ile make you two joynt heirs of my estate, And you shall give it out: we two are dead By our own hands. And beare us both this night To church in coffins. Whence we'le make escape, And bid farewell to Thebes. Asot. Would you not both Be buried in one coffin? then the grave Would have her tenants multiply:âheare you Tutour, Shall not we be suspected for the murder, And choke with a hempen squincy? Tyn. To secure you, We'le write before what we intend to act: Our hands shall witnesse with your innocence. Ball. Well: Come the worst, I'le venture;âand perchance You shall not die in jest again o'th' suddain. Tyn. What strange MÃ¦anders Cupid leads us through! When most we forward go, we backward move. There is no path so intricate as Love!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS IIII. SCEN. I. Ballio, Asotus, ChÃ¦rilus, and Bomolochus, bearing the coffin of Techmessa; Hyperocus, Thrasimachus bearing the coffin of Tyndarus, a servant. Ball. Carry these letters unto Chremylus house. Give this to Pamphilus, to Evadne that, And certifie 'um of this sad event. It will draw teares from theirsâAs from my eyes, Because they are not reall obsequies. Asot. So great my grief, so dolorous my disaster, I know not in what language to expresse it, Unlesse I should be dumbe!âSobâsob Asotus, Sob till thy buttons break, and crack thy bandstrings With lamentation, and distress'd condoling, With blubberd eyes behold this spectacle Of mans mortality.âO my dearest Tyndarus! Thras. Learn of us Captains to outface grimme death, And gaze the lean-chapt monster in the face. Asot. I, and I could but come to see his face, I'de scratch his eyes out.âO the ugly Rogue! Could none but Tyndarus and fair Techmessa Serve the vile varlet to lead apes in hell? Hyper. I have seen thousands sigh out souls in grones And yet have laugh'd:âit has been sport to see, A mangled carcasse broach'd with so many wounds That life has been in doubt which to get out at. Asot. Are crawling vermine of so choice a diet? Would I were then a worm, freely to feed On such a delicate and Ambrosian dish: Fit to be serv'd a banquet to my bed! But OâTechmessa death has swallowed thee, Too sweet a sop for such a fiend as he. ChÃ¦. Chase hence these showres, for since they both were dead, Teares will not bribe the fates for a new thread. Bom. Inexorable sisters,âBe not sorry: For Clotho's distaffe will be peremptory! Asot. Go then, and dip your pens in gall and vineger To rail on Mors, cruelâimpartiall Mors: The salvage Tyrantâall-devouring Mors: The envious, wicked, and malicious Mors: Mors that respects not valour, Mors that cares not For wit or learning, Mors that spares not honour: Mors whom wealth bribes not, Mors whom beauty tempts not. Thus loudly rail on Mors, that Mors may know it To be reveng'd on Mors I keep a Poet. Thras. If Mors were here, the Skeleton should know I'de cut his charnell bones to dice, for grieving Our noble GenerallâCourage bon chevalier! SCEN. II. Simo, Asotus, Ballio, Thrasimachus, Hyperbolus, ChÃ¦rilus, Bomolochus. Sim. Why is my boy so sad?âTell me Asotus: If dissolv'd gold will cure thee, melt a Treasure. Asot. O sad mischance! Sim. What grieves my hopeâmy joy. My staff, my comfort? Asot. Wofull accident! Sim. Have I not barricadoed all my doores, And stop't each chink and cranny in my house, To keep out poverty and lean misfortune? Where crept this sorrow in? Asot. Here, through my heart. O father, I will tell you such a story Of such a sad and lamentable nature, 'Twill crack your purse-strings. Sim. Ha? what story, boy? My friend, my deare friend Tyndarus, Sir, is dead. âAnd, to augment my sorrow,âkill'd himself. And yet to adde more to my heap of griefs, Left me and Ballioâhis estateâ Sim. Alas! Is not this counterfeit sorrow well exprest? Ball. But I grieve truely that I grieve in jest: Sim. Half his estate to thee, and half to Ballio? A thousand pities.âGently rest his bones. I cannot but weep with thee. Ball. Sir, you see If you had left him nothing, my instructions Can draw in patrimonies. Sim. He is rich In nothing but a Tutour.âGood Asotus, Though sorrow be a debt due to the herse Of a dead friend, and we must wet the turf Under whose roof he lodges: yet we must not Be too immoderate. Asot. Beare me witnesse, heaven! I us'd no force of Rhetorick, no perswasions (What e're the wicked and malicious world May rashly censure) to instigate these two To their own deaths. I knew not of the plot, All of you know that I am ignorant. Phryn. Where is my love? shall sorrow rivall me, Enter Phryne. And hang about thy neck? If grief be got Into thy cheeks, I'le clap it out.âDeare chicken, You sha'not be so sad, indeed you sha' not. Be merry: by this kisse I'le make you merry. Asot. Then wipe my eyes.âThus when the clouds are gone, The day again is gilded by the sunne. SCEN. III. Ballio, Asotus, Simo, Phryne, Thrasimachus, Hyperb. ChÃ¦rilus, Bomolochus, Sexton. Asot. VVho's within here? Sext. What's the matter without there? Asot. Ha! What art thou? Sext. The last of tailours, Sir, that ne're take measure of you, while you have hope to weare a new suit. Asot. How dost thou live? Sext. As worms do:âby the dead. Asot. A witty rascall. Let's have some discourse with him. Thras. Are any souldiers bones in garrison here? Sext. Faith, Sir, but few: they like poore travellers Take up their inne by chance: but some there be. Thras. Do not those warlike bones in dead of night Rise up in arms, and with tumultuous broyls Waken the dormise that dull peace hath lull'd Into a lethargie?âDost not heare 'um knock Against their coffins, till they crack and break The marble into shivers that intombes 'um? Making the temple shake as with an earthquake, And all the statues of the gods grow pale, Affrighted with the horrour? Sext. No such matter. Hyper. Do they not call for arms? and fright thee, mortall, Out of thy wits? Do they not break the legs, And crush the skuls that dare approach too neare Their honour'd graves?âWhen I shall come to dwell In your dark family, if a noysome carcase Offend my nostrils with too ranck a sent, KnowâI shall rageâand quarrell,âtill I fright The poore inhabitants of the charnell house: That here shall run a toe, a shin-bone there: Here creeps a hand, there trowles an arm away. One way a crooked rib shall halting hie, Another you shall trundling finde a skull. Like the distracted citizens of a town Beleaguer'd,âand in danger to be taken. Asot. For heavens sake, Sexton, lay my quiet bones By some precise religious officer, One that will keep the peace.âThese roaring captains, With blustring words and language full of dread, Will make me quit my tombe, and run away Wrap't in my winding sheet,âas if grim Minos, Stern Ãacus, and horrid Rhadamanth Enjoyn'd the corps a penance. Sext. Never fear it. This was a captains skull, one that carried a storm in his countenance, and a tempest in his tongue. The great bug-beare of the citie, that threw drawers down the stairs as familiarly as quartpots; and had a pension from the Barbour-chirurgeons for breaking of pates. A fellow that had ruin'd the noses of more bawds and pandars, then the disease belonging to the trade.âAnd yet I remember when he went to buriall, another corse took the wall of him, and the ban-dog ne're grumbled. Asot. Then skull (although thou be a captains skull) I say thou art a coward,âand no Gentleman; Thy mother was a whore,âand thou liest in thy throat. Hyper. Do not, live hare, pull the dead lions beard. Asot. No, good Hyperbolus, I but make a jest To show my reading in moralitie. ChÃ¦r. Do not the ashes of deceased Poets Inspir'd with sacred fury, carroll forth Enthusiastick raptures? Dost not heare 'um Sing mysteries, and talk of things conceal'd The rest of mortall judgements? Dost not see Apollo and the Muses every night Dance rings about their tombes? Bom. Do not roses, Lilies, and violets grow upon their graves? Shoots not the laurell that impal'd their brows Into a tree, to shadow their blest marble? Do they not rise out of their shrowds to read Their Epitaphs? and if they like 'um not, Expunge 'um, and write new ones? Do they not Rore in caliginous terms, and vapour forth From reeking entrals fogs Egyptian, To puzzle even an oculate intellect? Prate they not cataracts of insensible noise, That with obstreperous cadence cracks the organs Acroamatick, till the deaf auditor Admires the words he heares not? Sext. This was a poeticall noddle. O the sweet lines, choice language, eloquent figures, besides the jests, half jests, quarter jests, and quibbles that have come out o'these chaps that yawn so! He has not now so much as a new-coyn'd-complement to procure him a supper. The best friend he has may walk by him now, and yet have ne're a jeere put upon him. His mistresse had a little dog deceased the other day, and all the wit in this noddle could not pump our an Elegie to bewail it. He has been my tenant this seven yeares, and in all that while I never heard him rail against the times, or complain of the neglect of learning. Melpomene and the rest of the Muses have a good time on't that he is dead: for while he lived, he ne're left calling upon 'um. He was buried (as most of the tribe) at the charge of the parish, and is happier dead then alive: for he has now as much money as the best in the company,âand yet has left off the poeticall way of begging, call'd Borrowing. Asot. I scorn thy Lyrick and Heroick strain, Thy tart Iambick, and Satyrick vein. Where be thy querks and tricks? show me again The strange conundrums of thy frisking brain, Thou Poets skull, and say, What's rime to chimney? Sext. Alas! Sir, you ha' pos'd him: he cannot speak to give you an answer, though his mouth be alwayes open. A man may safely converse with him now, and never fear stifling in a crowd of verses. And now a Play of his may be freely censur'd, without a libel upon the audience. The boyes may be bold to cry it down. Ball. I cannot yet contrive it handsomely. Me thinks the darknesse of the night should prompt me To a plot of that complexion.âRuminate, Ruminate Ballio. Phryn. Pray, Sir, how does death Deal with the Ladies? Is he so unmannerly As not to make distinction of degrees? I hope the rougher bones of men have had More education, then to trouble theirs That are of gentler stuffe. Sext. Death is a blunt villain, Madam: he makes no distinction betwixt Jone and my Lady. This was the prime Madam in Thebes, the generall mistresse, the onely adored beauty. Little would you think there were a couple of starres in these two augur-holes: or that this pit had been arch'd over with a handsome nose, that had been at the charges to maintain half a dozen of severall silver arches to uphold the bridge. It had been a mighty favour once, to have kiss'd these lips that grin so. This mouth out of all the Madams boxes cannot now be furnished with a set of teeth. She was the coyest overcurious dame in all the city: her chambermaids misplacing of a hair, was as much as her place came to.âOh! if that Lady now could but behold this physnomie of hers in a looking-glasse, what a monster would she imagine her self! Will all her perrukes, tyres and dresses, with her chargeable teeth, with her cerusse and pomatum, and the benefit of her painter and doctor, make this idol up again? Paint Ladies while you live, and plaister fair, But when the house is fallne 'tis past repair. Phryn. No matter, my Asotus: Let death do His pleasure then, we'le do our pleasures now. Each minute that is lost is past recall. This is the time alotted for our sports, 'Twere sinne to passe it. While our lips are soft, And our embraces warm, we'le twine and kisse. When we shall be such things as these, let worms Crawl through our eyes, and eat our noses off, It is no matter. While we liv'd, we liv'd. Asot. And when we die, we die. We will be both embalm'd In precious unguents to delight our sense, And in our grave we'le busse, and hug, and dally As we do here: for death can nothing be To him that after death shall lie with thee. Sexton, receive these coffins to the temple; But not interre them,âfor they both are guilty Of their own bloud,âtill we make expiation T'assoyl the fact.âTutour reward the Sexton. I'le come sometimes and talk moralitie with him. Ball. This, Sir, my Pupill gives you:âbut hereafter I'le more then treble it, if you be no enemie To your own profit. Sext. Profit's my religion. Asot. Now you that bore my dead friends to the grave, Usher my living mistresse home again. Thus joy with grief alternate courses shares, Fortune, I see thy wheel in all affairs. Exeunt omnes prÃ¦ter Sexton. SCEN. IIII. Sexton, and his wife Staphyla. Sext. Staphyla, why Staphyla: I hope she has ta'ne her last sleep. Why when, Staphyla? Staph. What a life have I? I, that can never be quiet. I can no sooner lie down to take my rest, but presently Staphyla, Staphyla. What's the news? Sext. A prize, my rogue, a prize. Staph. Where? or from whom? Sext. Why, thou knowest I rob no where but on the highway to heaven, such as are upon their last journey thither. Thou and I have been land-pyrats this six and thirty yeares, and have pillaged our share of Charons passengers. Here are a couple of sound sleepers, and perchance their clothes will fit us. Then will I walk like a Lord, and thou shalt be my Madam, Staphyla. Staph. Truely, husband, I have had such fearfull dreams to night, that I am perswaded (though I think I shall never turn truely honest again) to rob the dead no more. For, me thought, as you and I were robbing the dead, the dead took heart, and rob'd us. Sex. Tush, dreams are idle things. There is no felonie warrantable but ours, for it is grounded on rules of charity. Is it fitting the dead should be cloath'd, and the living go naked? Besides, what is it to them whether they lie in sheets or no? Did you ever heare of any that caught cold in his coffin? Moreover, there is safety and security in these attempts: What inhabitant of the grave that had his house broke open, accus'd the thief of Burglarie? Look here: This is a Lawyers skull. There was a tongue in't once, a damnable eloquent tongue, that would almost have perswaded any man to the gallows. This was a turbulent busie fellow, till death gave him his Quietus est. And yet I ventured to rob him of his gown, and the rest of his habillements, to the very buckrum-bag, not leaving him so much as a poore half-peny to pay for his waftage: and yet the good man ne're repin'd at it. Had he been alive, and were to have pleaded against me, how would he have thundred it?âBehold (most grave Judges) a fact of that horrour and height in sinne, so abominable, so detestable in the eyes of heaven and earth, that never any but this dayes cause presented to the admiration of your eares. I cannot speak it without trembling, 'tis so new, so unus'd, so unheard of a villanie! But that I know your Lordships confident of the honestie of your poore Oratour, I should not hope by all my reasons, grounds, testimonies, arguments, and perswasions to gain your belief. This man, said I man? this monster rather: but monster is too easie a name: this devil, this incarnate devil, having lost all honesty, and abjur'd the profession of vertue, Rob'd, (a sinne in the action.) But who? The dead. What need I) aggravate the fault? the naming the action is sufficient to condemne him. I say, he rob'd the dead. The dead! Had he rob'd the living, it had been more pardonable: but to rob the dead of their clothes, the poore impotent dead, that can neither card, nor spin, nor make new ones, O 'tis most audacious and intolerable! âNow you have well spoke, why do you not after all this Rhetorick, put your hand behinde you, to receive some more instructions backward? Now a man may clappe you o'th' coxcombe with his spade, and never stand in fear of an action of batterie. Staph. For this one time, husband, I am induced; but insooth I will not make a common practise of it. Knock you up that coffin, and I'le knock up this.âRich and glorious! Sex. Bright as the sunne! Come, we must strip you Gallants, the worms care not for having the dishes serv'd up to their table cover'd. O, O, O! Tyndarus, and Techmessa rise from the coffins, and the Sexton and his wife affrighted, fall into a swoon. Staph. Heaven shield me! O, O, O! SCEN. V. Tyndarus and Techmessa. Tyn. How poore a thing is man, whom death it self Cannot protect from injuries! O ye gods! Is't not enough our wretched lives are toss'd On dangerous seas, but we must stand in fear Of Pyrates in the haven too? Heaven made us So many buts of clay, at which the gods In cruell sport shoot miseries.âYet, I hope, Their spleen's grown milder, and this blest occasion Offers it self an earnest of their mercy. Their sinnes have furnisht us with fit disguises To quiet our perplexed souls. Techmessa, Let me aray you in this womans robes. I'le weare the Sextons garments in exchange. Our sheets and coffins shall be theirs. Tech. Deare Tyndarus! In all my life I never found such peace As in this coffin: it presented me The sweets that death affords.âMan has no libertie But in this prison.âBeing once lodg'd here, He's fortified in an impregnable fort, Through which no doubts, suspicions, jealousies, No sorrows, cares, or wilde distractions Can force an entrance to disturb our sleeps. Tyn. Yet to those prisons will we now commit These two offenders. Tech. But what benefit Shall we enjoy by this disguise? Tyn. A great one: If my Evadne, or thy Pamphilus E're lov'd us living, they will haste to make Atonement for our souls, stain'd with the guilt Of our own bloud: if not, they will rejoyce Our deaths have opened them so cleare a passage To their close loves: and with those thoughts possess'd, They will forget the torments hell provides For those, that leave the warfare of this life Without a passe from the great Generall. Tech. I hope they may prove constant! Tyn. So pray I. I will desire yon statue, be so courteous To part with's beard a while.âSo we are now Beyond discovery. Sex. O, O, O! Staph. O, O, O! Tyn. Let's use a charm for these. [Tyn.] Quiet sleep, or I will make Erinnys whip thee with a snake. And cruell Rhadaman thus take Thy body to the boyling lake, Where fire and brimstone never slake. Thy heart shall burn, thy head shall ake, And every joynt about thee quake. And therefore dare not yet to wake. Tech. Quiet sleep, or thou shalt see The horrid hags of Tartarie. Whose tresses ugly serpents he, And Cerberus shall bark at thee. And all the Furies that are three, The worst is call'd Tisiphone, Shall lash thee to eternitie. And therefore sleep thou peacefully. Tyn. But who comes hither? Ballio, what's his businesse? SCEN. VI. Ballio, Tyndarus, Techmessa. Ball. Sexton, I'le open first thine eares with these, To make 'um fit to let perswasions in. Tyn. These, Sir, will cure my deafnesse. Ball. Art thou mine? Tyn. Sir, you have bought me. Ball. I'le pay double for thee. Shall I prevail in my request? Tyn. Ask these.â Ball. Th'art apprehensive, to the purpose then; Have you not in the temple some deep vault Ordain'd for buriall? Tyn. Yes. Ball. Then I proceed: We have to night perform'd the last of service That piety can pay to our dead friends. Tyn. 'Twas charitably done. Ball. We brought 'um hither To their last home.âNow Sir, they both being guilty Of their own deaths, I fear the laws of Thebes Deny 'um buriall. It would grieve me, Sir, (For friendship cannot be so soon forgot; Especially, so firm a one as ours) To have 'um cast a prey to Wolves and Eagles. Sir, these religious thoughts have brought me hither Now at the dead of night; to intreat you, To cast their coffins into some deep vault, And to interre 'um.âO my Tyndarus, All memory shall fail me, e're my thoughts Can leave th' impression of that love I beare thee. Thou left'st me half of all the land thou hadst; And should I not provide thee so much earth As I can measure by thy length, heaven curse me! Tyn. Sir, if your courtesie had not bound me yours, This act of goodnesse had. Ball. So true a friend No age records.âFarewell.âThis work succeeds! Posterity, that shall this story get, May learn from hence an art to counterfeit. Exit Ball. SCEN. VII. Tyndarus, Techmessa. Tyn. Here was a strange deliverance! who can be So confident of fortune, as to say, I now am safe? Tech. This villain has reveal'd All our designes to Pamphilus and Evadne: And they with bribes and hopes of an inheritance, If you were dead indeed, have won this rascall To this black treason.âWhat foul crimes can Lust Prompt her base vassals to!âHere let us end Our busie search, and travell o're the world, To see if any cold and Northern climat Have entertain'd lost Vertue, long since fled Our warmer countrey. Tyn. Ha!â'Tis so!â'Tis so! I see it with cleare eyes.âO cursed plot! And are you brooding crocodiles? I may chance To break the serpents egge, e're you have hatch'd The viper to perfection. Come Techmessa, My anger will no longer be confin'd To patient silence: Tedious expectation Is but a foolish fire by night, that leads The traveller out on's way.âBreak forth, my wrath: Break like a deluge of consuming fire, And scorch 'um both to ashes, in a flame Hot as their lust.âNo:â'Tis too base a bloud For me to spill.âLet 'um e'ne live t' ingender A brood of monsters:âMay perpetuall jealousie Wait on their beds, and poyson their embraces With just suspicions: may their children be Deform'd, and fright the mother at the birth: May they live long, and wretched; all mens hate, And yet have misery enough for pity: May they be long a dyingâof diseases Painfull, and loathsome:âPassion, do not hurrie me To this unmanly womanish revenge. Wilt thou curse Tyndarus when thou wear'st a sword? But ha, heark, observe!â SCEN. VIII. Pamphilus, Evadne, Tyndarus, Techmessa. Pam. VVait till we call. Heaven, if thou hast not emptied all thy treasury Of wrath upon me; here I challenge thee To lay on more. What torments hast thou left, In which thou hast not exercis'd my patience? Yet cast up all th' accounts of all my sorrows, And the whole summe is trebled in the losse Of deare Techmessa. Tech. If this grief were reall! Tyn. Be not too credulous. Pam. I have stood the rest Of your afflictions, with this one I fell, Fell like a rock that had repell'd the rage Of thousand violent billows, and withstood Their fierce assaults, untill the working Tide Had undermin'd him: then he falls, and draws Part of the mountain with him. Evad. Pamphilus, When did you see my sweet-heart? prithee tell me, Is he not gone a maying?âhe will bring me Some pincks and daysies home to morrow morning. Pray heaven he meet no theeves. Pam. Alas Evadne! Thy Tyndarus is dead. Evad. What shall I do? I cannot live without him. Tyn. I am mov'd: Yet I will make this triall full and perfect. What, at this dismall houre, when nothing walks But souls tormented, calls you from your sheets To visit our dark cells, inhabited By death and melancholy? Evad. I am come To seek my true-love here. Did you not see him? He's come to dwell with you, pray use him well, He was a proper Gentleman. Tech. Sir, what cause Inforc'd you hither? Pam. I am come to pay The tribute of my eyes to a dead Love. Tyn. Fair Lady, may I ask one question of you? Did you admit no love into your bosome But onely his? Evad. Alas! you make me weep. Could any woman love a man, but him! No Tyndarus, I will not long outlive thee: We will be married in Elysium, And arm in arm walk through th'-blessed groves, And change a thousand kisses,âyou sha'nt see us. Tyn. I know not whether it be joy or grief Forces teares from me. Tech. Were you constant, Sir, To her whose death you now so much lament? For by those prodigies and apparitions That have to night shak'd the foundations Of the whole temple, your inconstancy Hath caus'd your Mistresses untimely end. Pam. The Sunne shall change his course, and finde new paths To drive his chariot in: The Load-stone leave His faith unto the North:âThe Vine withdraw Those strict embraces that infold the Elme In her kinde arms:âBut, if I change my love From my Techmessa, may I be recorded To all posterity, Loves great Apostate In Cupids annalls. Evad. If you see my Tyndarus, Pray tell him I will make all haste to meet him. I will but weep a while first. Tyn. Pretie sorrow! Tech. Sir, you may veil your falshood in smooth language, And gild it o're with fair hypocrisie: But here has been such grones: Ghosts that have cried In hollow voices, Pamphilus, O false Pamphilus! Revenge on Pamphilus! Such complaints as these The gods ne're make in vain. Pam. Then there is witch-craft in't. And are the gods Made parties too against me?âPardon then If I grow stubborn.âWhile they prest my shoulders No more then I could beare, they willingly Submitted to the burden.âNow they wish To cast it off.âWhat treacherie has brib'd you, Celestiall forms, to be my false accusers? I chalenge you (for you can view my thoughts, And reade the secret characters of my heart.) Give in your verdict, did you ever finde Another image graven in my soul Besides Techmessa? No! 'Tis hell has forg'd These flie impostures! all these plots are coyn'd Out of the devils mintage? Tech. Certainly There's no false fire in this. Tyn. There cannot be. Evad. Pray, Sir, direct me where I may embalm My Tyndarus with my teares. Tyn. There gentle Lady. Evad. Is this a casket fit to entertain A jewell of such value? Pam. Where must I Pay my devotions? Tech. There your dead Saint lies. Evad. Hail Tyndarus, may earth but lightly presse thee: And mayst thou finde those joyes thou art gone to taste, As true as my affection. Now I know Thou canst not choose but love me, and with longing Expect my quick arrivall: for the soul Freed from the cloud of flesh, clearely discerns Forms in their perfect nature. If there be A guilt upon thy bloud, thus I'le redeem it, (offers to kill herself. And lay it all on mine. Tyn. What mean you, Lady? Evad. Stay not my pious hand. Tyn. Your impious rather. If you were dead, who then were left to make Lustration for his crime? shall foolish zeal Perswade you to a hasty death, and so Leave Tyndarus to eternity of flames? Evad. Pardon me, Tyndarus, I will onely see That office done, and then I'le follow thee. Pam. Thou gentle soul of my deceased love, If thou still hoverst here abouts, accept The vows of Pamphilus.âIf I ever think Of woman with affection, but Techmessa, Or keep the least spark of a love alive But in her ashes: let me never see Those blessed fields where gentle lovers walk In endlesse joyes.âWhy do I idlely weep! I'le write my grief in bloud. Tech. What do you mean? Pam. Techmessa, I am yet withheld; but suddenly I'le make escape to finde thee. Tech. O blest minute! SCEN. IX. Dypsas, Tyndarus, Evadne, Pamphilus, Techmessa. Dyps. Where shall I flie to hide me from my guilt? It follows me, like those that run away From their own shadows: that which I would shun I beare about me.âWhom shall I appease? The living, or the dead? for I have injur'd Both you, and them.âO Tyndarus, here I kneel, And do confesse my self thy cruel murdresse; And thine, Techmessa.âGentle daughter, pardon me. But how shall I make satisfaction, That have but one poore life, and have lost two? Oh Pamphilus! my malice ruin'd thee, But most Evadne: for at her I aim'd, Because she is no issue of my wombe, But trusted by her father to my care. Her have I followed with a stepdames hate, As envious that her beauty should eclipse My daughters honour.âBut the gods in justice Have ta'ne her hence to punish me.âMy sinnes March up in troops against me.âBut this potion Shall purge out life and them. Tyn. Be not too rash: I will revive Techmessa. Dyps. O sweet daughter! Pam. Thou hast reviv'd two lives at once. Evad. But I Still live a widowed virgin. Tyn. No, Evadne, Receive me new created, of a clay Purg'd from all dregs; my thoughts do all run cleare. Take hence those coffins. I will have them born Trophies before me, when we come to tie The nuptiall knot: for death has brought us life. Suspicion made us confident, and weak jealousie Hath added strength to our resolved love. Cupid hath run his maze, this was his day: But the next part Hymen intends to play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS V. SCEN. I. Demetrius solus. Hail sacred Thebes, I kisse thy blessed soil, And on my knees salute thy seven gates. Some twentie winters now have glaz'd thy flouds Since I beheld thy turrets, batter'd then With warre, that sought the ruine of those walls Which musick built, when Minos cruell tribute Rob'd mothers of their dearest babes, to glut His ravenous Minotaure, I for safety fled With my young sonnes, but call'd my countryes hate Upon my head, whom miserie made malicious. Each father had a curse in store for me, Because I shar'd not in the common losse: Yet would have willingly chang'd fortunes with me. I dare not meet the vulgars violent rage Eager against me. I will therefore study Some means to live conceal'd. SCEN. II. Demetrius, Asotus. Asot. I have heard my mother, Who had more proverbs in her mouth then teeth, (Peace with her soul where e're it be) affirm, Marry too soon, and you'le repent too late. A sentence worth my meditation: For marriage is a serious thing, perchance Fair Phryne is no maid: for women may Be beauteous, yet no virgins. Fair and chaste Are not of necessary consequence. Or being both fair and chaste, she may be barren; And then when I am old, I shall not have A boyâto dote on, as my father does. Dem. Kinde fortune fan you with a courteous wing. Asot. A prety complement. What art thou fellow? Dem. A Register of heaven, a privie Counsellour To all the planets, one that has been tenant To the twelve houses, Tutour to the Fates, That taught 'um th'art of spinning, a live Almanack, One that by speculation in the starres Can foretell any thing. Asot. How? foretell any thing? How many yeares are past since Thebes was built? Dem. That is not to foretell: you state the question Of times already past. Asot. And cannot you As well foretell things past, as things to come? Say, Register of heaven, and Privy-counsellour To all the planets, with the rest of your titles, (For I shall ne're be able to repeat 'um all) Shall I, as I intend, to day be married? Dem. Th' Almutes, or the Lord of the Ascendent, I finde with Luna corporally joyn'd To the Almutes of the seventh house, Which is the matrimoniall family: And therefore I conclude the nuptialls hold. And yet th' Aspect is not in Trine, or Sextile, But in the Quartile radiation, Or Tetragon, which showes an inclination Averse, and yet admitting of reception. It will, although encountred with impediment, At last succeed. Asot. Ha? What bold impediment Is so audacious to encounter me? Be he Almutes of what house he please; Let his Aspect be Sextile, Trine, or Quartile; I do not fear him with his radiations, His Tetragons, and inclinations: If he provoke my spleen, I'le have him know I souldiers feed shall mince him, and my Poets Shall with a satyre steep'd in gall and vineger, Rime 'um to death, as they do rats in Ireland. Dem. Good words. There's no resistance to the laws of Fate. This sublunary world must yeeld obedience To the celestiall vertues. Asot. One thing more I would desire to know: Whether my spouse That shall be, be immaculate. I'de be loth To marry an Advowsion that has had Other incumbents. Dem. I'le resolve you instantly. The Dragons-tail stands where the head should be: A shrew'd suspicion,âshe has been strongly tempted. Asot. The Dragons-tail puts me in a horrible fear. I feel a kinde of a sting in my head already. Dem. And Mars being landlord of th'eleventh house, Plac'd in the Ram and Scorpion, plainly signifies The maid has been in love; but the Aspect Being without reception, layes no guilt Of act upon her. Asot. I shall be jealous presently: For the Ram is but an ill signe in the head; And you know what Scorpio aims at in the Almanack. Dem. But when I see th' Ascendent and his Lord, With the good Moon in angles and fixt signes, I do conclude her virgin pure and spotlesse. Asot. I thank th' Ascendent, and his noble Lord; He shall be welcome to my house at any time, And so shall mistresse Moon, with all her angles, And her fixt signes. But how come you to know All this for certain? Dem. Sir, the learned Cabalists. And all the Chaldees do conclude it lawfull: As Asla, Baruch, and Abobalt, Caucaph, Toz, Arcaphan, and Albuas, Gafar, with Hali, Hippocras, and Lencuo, With Ben, Benesaphan, and Albubetes. Asot. Are Asta, Baruch, and Abohali, With all the rest o'th' Jury, men of credit? Dem. Their words shall go as farre i'th' Zodiack, Sir, As anothers bond. Asot. I am beholding to 'um. Another scruple yet,âI would have children too, Children to dote on, Sir, when I grow old, Such as will spend when I am dead and gone, And make me have such fine dreams in my grave. Dem. Sir, y'are a happy man. I do not see In all your horoscope one signe masculine; For such portend sterility. Asot. How's that man? Is't possible for any man to ha' children Without a signe masculine? Dem. Sir, you mistake me: You are not yet initiate. The Almutes Of the Ascendent is not elevated, Above the Almutes of the filial house. Venus is free, and Jove not yet combust: And then the signifier being lodg'd In watry signes, the Scorpion, Crab, and Fish, Foreshow a numerous issue of both sexes. And Mercury in's exaltations Plac'd in their angles, and their points successive, Beholds the Lords of the Triplicity Unhindered in their influence. You were born Under a getting constellation, A fructifying starre.âSir, I pronounce you A joyfull father. Asot. Happy be the houre I met with thee. I'le ha' thee live with me. Thou shalt be my domesticall Astronomer. I have a brace of Poets as fit as may be, To furnish thee with verses for each moneth. Sir, since the gracious starres do promise me So numerous a troup of sonnes and daughters, 'Tis fit I should have my means in my own hands To provide for 'um all: therefore I fain would know Whether my father beâlong-liv'd, or no. Dem. The planet Mars is Orientall now To Saturn; but in reference to the Sun He beares a Westerly position. Which Ylem linking Saturn with the Sun In opposition, both sinisterly Fallne from their corners, plainly signifies He cannot long survive. Asot. Why, who can help it? There's no resistance to the laws of Fate: This sublunary world must yeeld obedience To the celestiall vertues.âWert not providence To bespeak mourning clokes against the funerall? Dem. 'Tis good to be in readines. Asot. If thou be So cunning a prophet, tell me; Do I mean To entertain thee for my wizard? Dem. Sir, I do not see the least Azymenes, Or planetary hindrance. Alcocoden Tells me you will. Asot. Tell Alcocoden then He is ith' right. Thrasimachus, Hyperbolus! (Enter Thrasim. Hyperb. We have increas'd our family, see him enroll'd. He is a man of merit, and can prophesie. Thrasim. We'le drench him in the welcome of the celler, And trie if he can prophesie who falls first. Asot. How will the world admire me, when they see My house an Academie, all the arts Wait at my table, every man of quality Take sanctuary here! I will be patron To twenty liberall sciences. SCEN. III. Asotus, Ballio. Ball. A fair sunne Shine on the happy bridegroom. Asot. Quondam Tutour, (For I am past all tuition but my wifes) Thanks for your wishes; have you studied yet How with one charge (for ceremonious charge I care not for) I may expresse my grief At the sad funerals of my friends deceas'd, And yet proclaim with how much joy I wed The beauteous Phryne? Ball. I have beat my brain To finde out a right garb: weare these two clokes. This sable garment, sorrows Liverie, Speaks funerall: this richer robe of joy, Sayes 'tis a nuptiall solemnitie. Asot. A choice device:âI'le practise. Ball. Rarely well. SCEN. IIII. Asotus, Ballio, Simo. Sim. Good morrow boy: how flows thy bloud, Asotus, Upon thy wedding day? is it spring-tide? Find'st thou an active courage in thy bones? Wilt thou at night create me Grandsire? ha? O, I remember with what sprightly courage I bedded thy old mother, and that night Bid fair for thee boy: how I curst the ceremonies, And thought the yongsters scrambled for my points Too slowly: 'Twas a happy night, Asotus. Asot. How sad a day is this! methinks the sunne Affrighted with our sorrows, should run back Into his Eastern palace, and for ever Sleep in the lap of Thetis. Can he show A glorious beam when Tyndarus is dead, And fair Techmessa? I will weep a floud Deep as Deucalions; and again the Chaos Shall mufle up the lamentable world In sable clokes of grief and black confusion! Sim. What ailes my boy? unseasonable grief Shall not disturb thy nuptialls.âGood Asotus, Be not so passionate. Ball. What incomparable mirth Would such a dotard and his humorous sonne Make in a Comedie, if a learned pen Had the expression! Asot. Now the tother cloke. In what a verdant weed the spring arayes Fresh Tellus in! how Flora decks the fields With all her tapestry! and the Choristers Of every grove chaunt Carrolls! Mirth is come To visit mortalls. Every thing is blithe, Jocund, and joviall. All the gods arrive To grace our nuptialls. Let us sing and dance, That heaven may see our revells, and send down The planets in a Masque, the more to grace This dayes solemnitie. Sim. I, this Asotus, There's musick boy in this. Asot. Now this cloke again, You Gods, you overload mortalitie, And presse our shoulders with too great a weight Of dismall miseries. All content is fled With Tyndarus and Techmessa. Ravens croak About my house ill-boding schreech-owls sing Epithalamiums to my spouse and me. Can I dream pleasures, or expect to taste The comforts of the married bed, when Tyndarus And fair Techmessa from the world are gone! No, pardon me you gentle ghosts; I vow To cloister up my grief in some dark cell: And there till grief shall close my blubber'd eyes, Weep forth repentance. Sim. Sure he is distracted! Asotus, do not grieve so, all thy sorrows Are doubled in thy father: Pity me, If not thy self; O pity these gray hairs, Pity my age, Asotus. Asot. What a silly fellow My father is, that knows not which cloke speaks? Father, you do forget this is our nuptiall. Cast off those trophies of your wealthy beggerie, And clad your self in rich and splendent weeds, Such as become my father: Do not blemish Our dignity with rags. Appeare to day As glorious as the sunne. Set forth your self In your bright lustre. Sim. So I will, my boy: Was there ever father so fortunate in a childe? Exit Sim. Asot. Do not I vary with decorum, Ballio? Ball. I do not think but Proteus, Sir, begot you On a ChamÃ¦leon. Asot. Nay, I know my mother Was a ChamÃ¦leon, for my father allowed her Nothing but aire to feed on. SCEN. V. Ballio, Asotus, Phryne. Phryn. Rises Aurora with a happy light On my Asotus? Asot. Beauteous Phryne, welcome: Although the dragons tail may scandall thee, And Mars corrupt the Scorpion and the Ramme; Yet the good Moon in angles and fixt signes Gives thee a good report. Phryn. What means my deare? Asot. Thy deare, my beauteous Phryne, means the same With Hali, Baruch and Abohali, Caucaph, Toz, Archaphan, and Albuas, Gafar, with Afla, Hippocras, and Lencuo, With Ben, Benesaphan, and Albubetez. Phryn. I fear you ha' studied the black art of late. Asot. Ah Girle! Th'âAlmutes of the filiall house Is not depress'd, Venus is free, and Jove Not yet combust: the signes are watry signes, And Mercury beholds the trine aspect Unhinder'd in his influence. Phryn. What of all this? Asot. We shall have babies plenty: I am grown Learned of late. Go Phryne, be in readinesse, I long to tie the knot: at night we'le make A young Asotus. Phryn. Health attend you, Sir. Exit Phryn. SCEN. VI. Dypsas, Tyndarus, Evadne, Pamphilus, Techmessa, Asotus, Ballio, Phronesium, Priests and sacrifice, and Hymens statue discovered. Asot. Tyndarus living? here take this cloke away, Ballio: We have no use on't. Ball. The more sorrow's mine. Tyn. How does my friend Asotus? Asot. You are welcome From the dead, Sir: I hope our friends in Elysium Are in good health. Tyn. Ballio, I thank you heartily You had an honest and religious care To see us both well buried. Ball. I shall be hang'd. Exit. The song and sacrifice. Priest. Hymen, thou God of union, with smooth brow Accept our pious Orgies. Thou that tiest Hearts in a knot, and link'st in sacred chains (He presents Tyndarus and Evadne. The mutuall souls of Lovers, may it please Thy Deitie, to admit into the number Of thy chaste votaries this blessed pair. Mercy you Gods, the statue turns away. Tyn. Why should this be? The reason is apparent: Evadne has been false, and the chaste deitie Abhorres the sacrifice of a spotted soul. Go thou dissembler, mask thy self in modesty, Weare vertue for a veil, and paint false blushes On thy adulterate cheek. Though thou mayst cozen The eyes of man, and cheat the purblinde world, Heaven has a piercing sight. Hymen, I thank thee; Thou stoppedst my foot stepping into the gulf. How neare was I damnation! Evad. Gentle Hymen, What sinne have I unwillingly committed To call heavens anger on me? Priest. If there be A secret guilt in these that hath offended Thy mighty godhead, wilt thou please to prove He presents Pamphil. &amp; Techmessa This other knot? The Statue turns again! What prodigies are these! Pam. Celestiall powers, You tyrannize o're man: and yet 'tis sinne To ask you why you wrong us. Tech. Cunning Pamphilus, Though, like a snake, you couch your self in flowers, The gods can finde your lurking, and betray The spotted skin. Priest. Above this twenty yeares Have I attended on thy sacred Temple, Yet never saw thee so incens'd, dread Hymen. Tyn. To search the reason, will you please to proffer These to his godhead? Priest. Will thy godhead daigne These two the blessings of the geniall sheet? He presents Pamphilus and Evadne He beckens 'um. Tyn. I, there the faith is plighted. False Pamphilus, the honour of the temple, And the respect I beare religion, Cannot protect thee. I will stain the altars, And sprinkle every statue in the shrine With treacherous bloud. Priest. Provoke not Joves just thunder. Tyn. Well, you may take Evadne; heaven give you joy. Pamp. Religion is meere juggling. This is nothing But the Priests knaverie: a kinde of holy trick To gain their superstition credit. Hymen, Why dost thou turn away thy head? I fear Thy bashfull deitie is asham'd to look A woman in the face. If so, I pardon thee: If out of spight thou crosse me, know, weak godhead, I'le teach mankinde a custome that shall bring Thy altars to neglect. Lovers shall couple, As other creatures,âfreely, and ne're stand Upon the tedious ceremonieâMarriage: And then thou Priest mayst starve. Who in your temple Will light aâCere-candle, or for incense burn A grain of frankincense? Chrem. Heaven instruct our souls To finde the secret mysterie! Asot. I have entertain'd One that by Ylem and Aldeboran, With the Almutes, can tell any thing. I'le fetch him hither: he shall resolve you. Exit Asot. Chrem. Man is a ship that sails with adverse windes, And has no haven till he land at death. Then when he thinks his hands fast grasp the bank, Comes a rude billow betwixt him and safetie, And beats him back into the deep again. SCEN. VIII. Enter Asotus, Demetrius: manent cÃ¦teri. Asot. Here's another figure to cast, Sir. These two Gentlemen Dem. A sudden joy o'recomes me. Asot. Are to marry Old Chremylus daughters. This is Tyndarus, And he should have Evadne: and this Pamphilus, That has a moneths-minde to Techmessa; but that Hymen Looks with a wry-neck at 'um. If the Ascendent With all his radiations and aspects Know any thing,âhere's one that can unfold it. I must go fit my self for mine own wedding. Exit. Dem. Flie from the temple you unhallowed troup, That dare present your sinnes for sacrifice Before the gods! Chrem. What should this language mean? Dem. Think you that heaven will ever signe a grant To your incestuous matches? Chrem. How incestuous? Dem. This is not Tyndarus, but Demetrius sonne, Call'd Clinias, and fair Evadnes brother. Evadne trusted in exchange to Chremylus, For young Timarchus, whom Demetrius took With him to Athens, when he fled from Thebes To save the infants from the monsters jaws, The cruel Minotaur. Marvell not the gods Forbid the banes, when in each match is incest. Chr. I wonder he should know this. Tyn. I am amaz'd. Dem. I will confirm your faith. Tyn. My father? He puls off his disguise Pam. My father? Dem. No, good Timarchus, ask thy blessing there. Sir, if I not mistake me, you are Chremylus. Pray let me see that ring.âSir, I must challenge it, And in requitall will return you this. Chrem. Demetrius! Welcome. Now my joyes are full, When I behold my sonne and my old friend. Dem. Which is Evadne? Blessings on thy head. Now Chremylus, let us conclude a marriage As we at first intended; my Clinias With your Techmessa, and your sonne Timarchus With my Evadne. Chrem. Heaven has decreed it so. Dem. Are the young people pleas'd? Pam., Evad., Tyn., Tech. The will of heaven Must be obey'd. Dem. Now try if Hymen please To end all troubles in a happy marriage. Priest. Hymen, we thank thee, and will crown thy head With all the glorious chaplets of the Spring, The first-born kid, and fattest of our bullocks Shall bleed upon thy altars (if it be Lawfull to sacrifice in bloud to thee, That art the means to life) 'cause thy provident mercie Prevented this incestuous match. Daigne now Propitious looks to this more holy knot. This virgin offers up her untouch'd zone, And vows chaste love to Clinias. All joy to you. The fair Evadne too is come to hang Her maiden-girdle at thy sacred shrine, And vows her self constant to the embraces Of young Timarchus.âHappinesse wait on both! Tyn. I see our jealous thoughts were not in vain. Nature abhorring from so foul a sinne, Infus'd those doubts into us. SCEN. VIII. Enter Asotus in arms with a drum and trumpet, attended by Thrasimachus, Hyperb. Bom. ChÃ¦r. Simo. Phryne. Asot. If there be any Knight that dares lay claim To beauteous Phryne,â(as I hope there's none) I dare him to th' encounter; let him meet me Here in the lists:âIf he be wise he dare not, But will consider danger in the action. I'le winne her with my sword:âmistake me not, I challenge no man. He who dares pretend A title to a hair,âshall sup with Pluto: 'Twere cooler supping in another place. No champion yet appeare?âI would fain fight. Phron. Sir, if you want a champion, I am for you. Asot. I ha' no quarrell to thee, Amazon. Phron. I must have a husband too, and I will have a husband; I, and I will have you: I can hold out no longer: I am weary of eating choak and coals, and begin to dislike the feeding on oat-meal. The thought of so many marriages together has almost lost my maiden-head. Asot. Why, thou shalt have my father: though he be old, He's rich, and will maintain thee bravely. Dad, What think you on't? Sim. Thou'lt make me, boy, too hap She shall have any thing. Phron. You will let me make My own conditions. Sim. What thou wilt, my girle. Phron. I will feed high, go rich, have my six horses, And my embroyder'd coach, ride where I list, Have all the gallants in the town to visit me, Maintain a pair of little legs to go On idle messages to all the Madams. You shall deny no Gentleman entertainment. And when we kisse and toy, be it your cue To nod and fall asleep. Sim. With all my heart. Asot. Then take him Girle, he will not trouble thee long. For Mars being orientall unto Saturn, And occidentall to the Sunne, proclaims He is short-liv'd. Phryn. Well Sir, for want of a better, I am content to take you. Asot. Joyn 'um, Priest. Priest. Thus I conjoyn you in religious bands. Asot. Now usher Phryne to my amorous arms. Priest. The generous Asotus and fair Phryne Present their vows unto thee, gracious Hymen. Sext. I forbid the banes. Staph. I forbid the banes. (They speak out of the coffin. As. And can there be no weddings without prodigies? This is th' impediment, the Azymenes Or Planetary hindrance threatned me. By the Almutes of the seventh house, In an aspect of Tetragon radiation, If Luna now be corporally joyn'd, I may o'recome th' aversenesse of my starres. Tyn. Sir, as you clear'd our doubts, I will cleare yours. See you these ghosts? Well Sexton, take heed hereafter How you rob the dead; some of 'um may cozen you. Sext. Pardon me, Sir; I seriously vow Henceforth to rob no creature but the living. Tyn. Well, you shall both fast to night, and take penance at the lower end of the table in these sheets, and that shall be your punishment. Asot. Phryne, I take thee for my loving spouse. Phryn. And I take you for my obedient husband. Priest. And I conclude the tie. Asot. Ha, you sweet rogue! SCEN. IX. Enter Ballio with a halter about his neck. Asot. Why how now Tutour, a rope about your neck? I have heard, that hanging and marrying go by destiny; But I never thought they had come together before. Ball. I have cast a serious thought upon my guilt, And finde my self an arrant rogue. The gallows Was all the inheritance I was ever born to. E'ne use me as you please. Asot. Pray, Sir, let me beg my Tutours pardon.â Spare him to day: for when the night comes on, There's sweeter executions to be done. Tyn. You have prevail'd. No man be sad to day. Come, you shall dine with mee. Asot. Pardon me, Sir: I will not have it said by the malicious, that I eat at another mans table the first day I set up house-keeping. No, you shall all go home and dine with me. Tyn. Come then: our joyes are ripen'd to perfection. Let us give heaven the praise, and all confesse, There is a difference 'twixt the jealousie Of those that wooe, and those that wedded be. This will hatch vipers in the nuptiall bed, But that prevents the aking of the head. Exeunt cum choro cantantium in laud. Hym.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogus. Asotus, Astrologer. Asot. How now? Will our endeavours give satisfaction? Astrol. I finde by the horoscope, and the elevation of the bright Aldeboran, a Sextile opposition; and that th'Almutes is inclining to the enemies house. Asot. Away with your Almutes, Horoscopes, Elevations, Aldeborans, Sextiles, and Oppositions. I have an art of mine own to cast this figure by. The Lovers now Jealous of nothing be But your acceptance of their Comedie. I question not heavens influence: for here I behold Angels of as high a Sphere. You are the starres I gaze at, we shall finde Our labours blest, if your Aspects be kinde, FINIS.</field>
