      <field name="fulltext">Enter Tota Mullishegs wife. Tota. It must not, may not, shall not be indur'd: Left we for this our Countrey? to be made A meere neglected Lady here in Fesse, A slave to others, but a scorne to all? Can womanish ambition, heat of blood, Or height of birth brooke this, and not revenge? Revenge? on whom? on mighty Mullisheg? We are not safe then; On the English stranger? And why on her, when thers no apprehension That can in thought pollute her innocence? Yet something I must doe. What? nothing yet? Nor must we live neglected; I should doubt I were a perfect woman, but degenerate From mine owne sex if I should suffer this: I have a thousand projects in my braine, But can bring none to purpose. Enter Bashaw Ioffer. Ioff. Cal'd your Majestie? Tota. No, yet I thinke I did; be gone, yet stay. Will not this mishapt Embrion grow to forme? Not yet? nor yet? Ioff. I attend your highnesse pleasure. Tota. 'Tis perfect, and I ha'te, I am ambitious but to thinke upon't, And if it prove as I have fashiond it, I shall be trophide ever. Ioff. I wait still. Tota. The King no way in perill, she secure, None harm'd, all pleas'd, I sweetly satisfied, And yet reveng'd at full. Braine, I for this Will wreathe thee in a glorious arch of gold, stuck full of Indian gemmes. But Tota, whom Wilt thou imploy in this? the Moores are treacherous, And them we dare not trust. Ioff. You neede not mee. Tot. Say, wher's the King? Ioff. I'th Presence. Tot. How? Ioff. Distempered late, and strangely humerous, The cause none can conjecture. Tot. Send in his sweet heart, And were his owne heart double rib'd with brasse, Yet she would search the inmost of his thoughts. No, 'tis not her on whom I build my project. Is the King upon his entrance? Ioff. 'Tis thought he is, If so, this sudden strange distemperature Hath not his purpose altered. Tot. You have now leave To leave us and attend the King, Ioff. I shall. Tot. If any of the English Ladies traine Come in your way, you may request them hither, Say, we would question some things of their countrey. Ioff. Madam, I shall. Tot. Then on to your attendance, what we must, Weele worke by th'English, these we dare not trust. Enter Clem meeting Ioffer. Ioff. 'Tis the Queenes pleasure you attend her. Clem. The Queene speake with me? Can you tell the businesse? A murren of these barbers of Barberie, they have given me a receipt, that scape the collicke as well as I can, I shall be sure never to be troubled with the stone. Ioff. Yonder she walkes. I leave ye. Tot. Now sir, you are of England? Clem. And I thinke you are a witch. Tot. How sirrah? Clem. A foolish proverbe we use in our countrey, which to give you in other words, is as much as to say, You have hit the naile on the head. Tot. And servant to the English Elizabeth, So great in Court by mighty Mullisheg, You follow her? Clem. I must confesse I am not her Gentleman usher to goe before her, for that way as the case stands with mee now, I can doe her but small pleasure, I doe follow her. Tot. You have seene both nations, England and our Fesse, how doe our people differ? Clem. Our countreymen eate and drinke as yours doe for all the world, open their eyes when they would see, and shut them againe when they would sleepe: when they goe they set one leg before another, and gape when their mouthes open, as yours eate when they have stomacks, scratch when it itcheth: onely I hold our nation to be the cleanlier. Tot. Cleanlier, wherein? Clem. Because they never sit downe to meat with such foule hands and faces. Tot. But how your Ladies and choice Gentlewomen? Clem. You shall meete some of them sometimes as fresh as flowers in May, and as faire as my Mistrisse, and within an hower the same Gentlewoman as blacke as your selfe, or any of your Morians. Tot. Can they change faces so? not possible: shew me some reason for't. Clem. When they put on their maskes. Tot. Maskes, what are they? Clem. Please you to put off yours, and Ile tell you. Tot. We weare none but that which nature hath bestowed on us, and our births give us freely. Clem. And our Ladies weare none but what the shops yeeld, and they buy for their money. Tot. Canst thou be secret to me Englishman? Clem. Yes, and chast too, I have tane a medicine for't. Tot. Be fixt to me in what I shall employ thee, Constant and private unto my designes, More grace and honour I will do to thee, Then ere thou didst receive from Mullisheg. Clem. Grace and honour? his grace and honour was to take away some part, and she would honour me to take away all: Ile see you damn'd as deep as the black father of your generation the devill first. Tot. Mistake me not. Clem. Nay if you were with childe with a young princely devill, and had a minde to any thing that's here, Ide make you lose your longing. Tot. Sure this fellow is some sot. Clem. Grace and honour, quotha. Enter Ruffman. Ruff. How now Clem, whither in such post hast? Clem. There, if you will have any grace and honour, you may pay fort as deare as I have done; 'sfoot I have little enough left, I would faine carry home something into my own countrey. Ruff. Why, what's the matter? I prethee stay. Clem. No, Lieutenant you shall pardon me, not I, the room is too hot for me: Ile be gone, do you stay at your own perill: Ile be no longer a prodigall, Ile keep what I have. Exit Clem. Tot. This should have better sense, Ile next prove him. Ruff. Excuse me mighty Princesse, that my boldnesse Hath prest thus far into your privacies. Tot. You no way have offended; nay, come neare, We love to grace a stranger. Ruff. 'Twas my ignorance, And no pretended boldnesse. Tot. I have observed you To be of some command amongst the English, Nor make I question but that you may be Of fair revennues. Ruff. A poore Gentleman. Tot. Weel make thee rich; spend that. Ruff. Your graces bounty Exceeds what merit can make good in me: I am your highnesse servant. Tot. Let that jewell be worne as our high favour. Ruff. 'Sfoot I think This Queen's in love with me. Madam, I shall. Tot. If any favour I can do in Court Can make you further gracious, speak it freely; What power we have is yours. Ruff. Doubtlesse it is so, and I am made for ever. Tot. Nay wee shall take it ill To give our selves so amply to your knowledge, And you not use us. Ruff. Vse us, now upon my life shee's caught: What, courted by a Queene? a royall Princesse; Where were your eyes Besse, that you could not see These hidden parts and misteries, which this Queene Hath in my shape observed? 'tis but a fortune That I was borne to, and I thanke heaven fort. Tot. May I trust you? Ruff. With your life, with your honour. Ile be as private to you as your heart Within your bosome, close as your owne thoughts. Ile bragge of this in England, that I once Was favourite to a Queene, my royall mistris. Tot. If what you have already promised youle make good, Ile prove so. Ruff. Madam, let this, Tot. What? Ruff. This kisse. Tot. This foole, this asse, this insolent gull. Ruff. Why, did not your grace meane plainely? Tot. In what, sir? Ruff. Did you not court me? Tot. How, that face? Thinkest thou I could love a Monkey, a Babone? Know, were I mounted in the height of lust, And a mere prostitute, rather then thee Ide imbrace, one, name but that creature That thou dost thinke most odious. Ruff. Pardon me Lady, I humbly take my leave. Tot. Have I given you your description I pray, sir, Be secret in't. Ruff. I shall be loath to tell it, Or publish it to any. Tot. Yet you are not gone: Know then you have incur'd The Kings wrath first, our high displeasure next, The least of which is death; yet will you grow More neare to us, and prove loyall unto my present purposes. I will not onely pardon you what's past. But multiply my bounties. Ruff. I am your prisoner. Tot. Be free, ther's nothing can be cal'd offence, But that in thee we pardon. Ruff. I am fast. Tot. And yet a free man: I am injur'd highly, And thou must aide me in my just revenge. Ruff. Were it to combate the most valiantst Moore, That ever Fesse, Morocko, or Argiers bred, I for your sake would doe it. Tot. We seeke nor blood, Nor to expose thee to the least of danger: I am modest, and what I dare not trust my owne tongue with, Or thoughts, Ile bouldly give unto thine eares, List: Do you shake your head, say, Is't done already? Ruff. Wrong my friend? Tot. Doe you cast doubts or dangers? Is not our life, Our honour all in your hand, and will you lavish us. Or scant that bounty should crowne you with excesse. Ruff. Ile pause upon't. Tot. Is not your life ours by your insolence? have not we power to take it? Ruff. Say no more, Ile doe it. Tot. But may I hope. Ruff. I have cast all doubts, and know how it may be compast. Tot. Ther's more gold, your secresie that's all I crave. Ruff. To prove my selfe in this just cause I have, An honest man, or a pernicious knave. Tot. Take the advantage of this night. Ruff. I shall expect faire end, All doubts are cast. Tot. So make a Queen thy friend. Recorders. Enter Mullisheg, Ioffer, and Alcade, Spencer, Goodlack, Besse, and the rest. Mul. All musick's harsh, command these discords cease, For we have war within us. Besse. Mighty King, What is't offends your highnesse? Mul. Nothing Besse: Yet all things do: Oh, what did I bestow, When I gave her away. Besse. The Queen attends you. Mull. Let her attend. Tot. I, King, neglected still, My just revenge shall wound, although not kill. Mull. I was a traitor to my own desires, To part with her so sleightly: what, no means To alter these proceedings? Spenc. Strange disturbances. Goodl. What might the project be? Alc. May it please your Highnesse, shall the Mask go forward, That was intended to grace this joviall night? Mull. Wee'll have none, Let it be treason held To any man that shall but name our pleasure, Or that vain word, delight: The more I gaze, The more I surfet; and the more I strive To free me from these fires, I am deeper wrapt: In flames I burne. Spenc. Your discontent, great Prince, takes from us all The edge of mirth: these nuptiall joyes that should Have sweld our souls with all the sweet varieties Of apprehensive wishes, with your sadnesse Grows dull and leaden: they have lost their taste In this your discontent all pleasures lose their sweetnesse. Bess. Mighty Fesse, Hath any ignorant neglect in us Bred these disturbances? Mull. Offence and you Are like the warring elements, oppos'd. And Fesse, why a king, and not command thy pleasure? Is she not within our kingdome? nay, within our palace, And therefore in our power: is she alone That happinesse that I desire on earth? Which since the heavens have given up to mine hands, Shall I despise their bounty? and not rather Run through a thousand dangers, to enjoy Their prodigall favours? dangers? tush, ther's none: We are here amidst our people, wall'd with subjects round, And danger is our slave: besides, our war Is with weak woman. Oh, but I have sworn And seal'd to her safe conduct; What of that? Can a king sweare against his own desires, Whose welfare is the sinews of his Realm? I should commit high treason gainst my self, Not to do that might give my soul content, And satisfie my appetite with fulnesse. Alcade. Alcad. My lord. Mull. Rides the English Negro still within the harbour? Alcad. Some league from land. Mull. Lest that these English should attempt escape, Now they are laden fully with our bounties, Cast thou a watchfull eye upon these two. Alcad. I shall. Mul. I know their loves so fervent and entire, They will not part asunder, she leave him, Or he without her make escape to sea. Then while the one's in sight our hopes are safe. Be that thy charge. Alcad. Ile be an Argus o're them. Goodl. Vnlesse the King be still in love with Besse, Repenting him of their late mariage, 'Tis beyond wonder to calculate these stormes. Mull. How goes the hower? Alcad. About some fower. Mul. We rose too soon Besse from your nuptiall feasts, Something we tasted made us stomack-sick, But now we finde a more contentfull change. Bess. Your sunshine is our day. Mul. Dispose your selves All to your free desires; to dancing some, Others to mount our stately Barberie horse, So famous through the world for swift carere, Stomack, and fierie pace. Those that love arms, Mount for the tilt: this day is yours, to you tis consecrate. He commits treason in the highest degree, Whose cloudy brow dares the least tempest shew To crosse what we intend: pleasure shall spring From us to flow on you. All. Long live the King: Exeunt, Manet Goodlack. Mull. To your free pastimes; leave us. Captain, stay Captain, I read a fortune in thy brow, More then the slight presage of augurie, Which tells me thou, and onely thou art mark't To make me earthly blest. Goodl. That I can do't? Mull. It lies in thee to raise thy ruin'd fortunes As high as is a Viceroy's, wreathe thy front Within a circled piramis of gold, And to command in all our territories, Next to our person. Goodl. Golden promises. Mull. Our words are acts, our promises are deeds, We do not feed with ayre: it lies in thee, We two may grapple souls, be friends and brothers. Goodl. Teach me how. Mull. I do not finde thee comming: in thy looks I cannot spie that fresh alacritie, Which with a glad and sprightfull forwardnesse, Should meet our love half way. Goodl. You wonder me. Mull. No, thou art dull, or fearfull, fare thee well, Thou hadst a fate lade up to make thee chronicled In thy own Countrey, but thou wilt basely lose it, Even by thine own neglect. Goodl. Forespeak me not, The Sun nere met the summer with more joy Then I'de embrace my fortunes; but to you, Great king, to whom I am so greatly bound, I'de purchas't with a danger should fright earth, Astonish heaven, and make all hell to tremble; I am of no shrinking temper. Mull. Prove but as wise as thou art bould and valiant, And gain me wholly to thee, half thou hast already Purchast by this bold answer; but perform The rest, and we are all and onely thine. Goodl. Shew me the way to gain this royall purchase, If I do't not, divide me from your presence, From your grace, and all those glorious hopes you have propos'd Turne into scorns and scandalls. Mull. I am dull, And drowsie on the sudden: whilst I sleep, Captain, read there. He countersets sleep, and gives him a letter. Goodl. To make Besse mine some secret means devise, To thy own height and heart Ile make thee rise. Is not this ink the blood of Basilisks, That kills me in the eies, and blindes me so, That I can read no further: 'twas compos'd Of Dragons poyson, and the gall of Aspes, Of Serpents venome, or of Vipers stings, It could not read so harsh else: Oh my fate; Nothing but this? this? Had a parliament Of fiends and furies in a synod sat, And devis'd, plotted, parlied, and contriv'd, They scarce could second this; This? 'tis unparallel'd: To strumpet a chast Lady, injure him That rates her honour dearer then his life. T'imploy a friend in treasons gainst his friend, And put that friend to do't: t'impose on me The hatefull stile and blot of pandarisme, That am a Gentleman: nay, worse then this, Make me in this a traytor to my countrey, In giving up their honours: Who but a Moor, Of all that beares mans shape, likest a devill, Could have devis'd this horrour? Possible That he should mark out me? What does my face Prognosticate, that he should finde writ there An index of such treasons? But beware, 'Twas his own plot, I, and his cunning too: Ile adde that to his project: but a Viceroy, And a kings Minion, titles that will shadow Ills the most base and branded. Not to do it May purchase his displeasure, which can be No lesse then death or bondage: heer's propos'd Honour and perill. But what writes he further; We are impatient of delayes, this night Let it be done. I am doubtfull of my purpose, And can resolve of nothing. Mullisheg starts out of his chaire as from a dream. Mull. If he fail, Ile have his flesh cut small as winters snow Or summers attoms. Goodl. Ha, was that by us? Mull. Where was I? Oh, I dream't upon the sudden, How fast was I. Goodl. A fair warning 'twas, have you the cunning To speak your thoughts in dreams? Mull. Who's i'th next room? Goodl. My lord. Mull. My Captain, was it thou? Sleep did surprise my senses, worthy friend, And in my dreams I did remember thee. Goodl. How, me my lord? Mull. Me thought I had emploid thee in a businesse, In which thou wert or fearfull, or else false, At which I was so overcome with rage, That from my dreams I started. Goodl. Seamen say, When Halcions sing, look for a storme that day, Ther's death in my deniall. Mull. Did you read, That scrowl we gave you Captain, ther's wrapt up A thousand honours for thee, and more gold Then shouldst thou live a double Nestors age, Thou couldst finde waies to lavish. Goodl. Add to your work a businesse of more danger, That I may think me worthy, otherwise This sleight employment will but prize me low And of desertlesse merit. Mull. Think'st thou Captain It may be easily compast? Goodl. Dare you trust me? Mull. I dare. Goodl. Then know, besides to dare and can, I will, though work beyond the power of man, Ile set my brains in action. Mull. Noble friend, Above thy thoughts our honours shall extend. Goodl. I am not to be shaken. Mull. Where be our Eunuchs? Wee'l crown our hopes and wishes with more pomp And sumptuous cost, then Priam did his sons, That night he bosom'd Hellen; shee's as fair, And wee'l command our pomp to be as rare. Wee will have torches shall exceed the stars In number and in brightnesse: we will have Rare change of musick shrill and high, That shall exceed the spheres in harmonie. The jewels of her habit shall reflect, To daze all eyes that shall behold her state. Our treasure shall like to a torrent rush Streams of rewards, richer then Tagus sands, To make these English strangers swim in gold. In wilde Moriskoes we will lead the bride: And when with full satieties of pleasures We are dull and satiate, at her radiant eyes Kindle fresh appetite, since they aspire, T'exceed in brightnesse the high orbs of fire. Make this Night mine, as we are King of Fesse, Th'art Viceroy, Captain. Exit Mullisheg. Goodl. Make my estate much lesse, And my attempts more honourable: honour and vertue, To me seem things in opposition: Nor can we with small danger catch at one, But we must lose the other. Oh my brain, In what a labyrinth art thou? Say I could Be false, as he would make me; what device? What plot? what train have I to compasse it? Or with what face can I sollicite her, In treason towards my friend? Enter Ruffman. Ruff. I am to sollicite Spencer To lie with the Moors Queen; a businesse, Besse Will hardly thank me for: but howsoever I have undertane it. Goodl. Impossibilities all; the more I wade, The more I drown in weaknesse. Ruff. Captain. Goodl. Oh Lieutenant, Never was man perplext thus. Ruff. What, as you? Had you but my disturbance in your brain, 'Twould tax a Stoicks wit, or Oedipus. Why Captain, a whole school of Sophisters Could not unriddle me. Goodl. I would we might change businesse. Ruff. I would give boot so to be rid of mine. Goodl. Shall we be free and open breasted? Ruff. How? Goodl. As thus; Tell me thy grievances, and unto thee I will unvail my bosome: both disclos'd Ile beg in mine thy counsell and assistance, Thy cause shall mine command. Ruff. A heart, a hand. Goodl. I am to woo fair Besse to lie with Mullisheg. Ruff. And I woo Spencer to embrace the Queen. Goodl. Is't possible? Ruff. 'Tis more then possible, 'tis absolutely past. Goodl. Ther's not a hair to chose, canst counsell me? Ruff. Can you advise me? Goodl. I am past my wits. Ruff. And I beyond all sense. Goodl. Wouldst thou do't, here lay the way plain before thee. Ruff. What, for gold Betray my friend and countrey, would you Captain? Goodl. What and wear a sword To guard my honour and a Christians faith, I'de flesh it here first. Ruff. Nobly resolved. Goodl. We are not safe Lieutenant, Moors are trecherous. Nay come, thy counsell, Fesse hath proferd me The honour of a Viceroy; and withall, If I should fail performance, cunningly Hath threatned me with death. Ruff. You still propose The danger, but you shew no way to clear them. Goodl. Brain, let me waken thee, 'sfoot hast thou no project? dost thou pertake my dulnesse? Ruff. The more I strive, the more I am intangled. Goodl. And I too. Not yet? Ruff. Nor yet, nor ever. Goodl. 'Twas comming here, &amp; now again 'tis vanisht. Ruff. Cal't back again for heavens sake. Goodl. Again. Ruff. Thanks heaven. Goodl. And now again 'tis gone. Ruff. Can you not catch fast hold on't? Goodl. Give me way, Let's walk Lieutenant: Could a man propose A stratagem to gull this lustfull Moor, To supply him, and then to satiate her? Ruff. Good. Goodl. Next, out of all these dangers secure us, And keep our treasure safe. Ruff. 'Twere excellent. Goodl. But how shall this be done? Ruff. Why Captain, know not you? Goodl. Think'st thou it in the power of man to work it? Yet come, Ile try, I owe my fate a death, Be swaid by me in all things. Ruff. Noble Captain, I do not wish to outlive thee.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundus. Scena prima. Enter Spencer, Besse, and Clem. Spencer. The King was wondrous pleasant: Oh my Besse, How much am I indebted to his highnesse, Onely for gracing thee. Besse. Could my Spencer Think that a barbarous Moor could be so train'd In humain vertues? Clem. Fie upon't: I am so tir'd with dancing with these same black shee-chimney-sweepers, that I can scarce set the best leg forward, they have so tir'd me with their Moriscoes, and I have so tickled them with our Countrey dances, Sellengers round, and Tom Tiler: we have so fidled it. Spenc. Sirrah, what news will you tell to your friends when you return into England. Clem. Brave news, which though I can neither write nor read, yet I have committed them to my tables and the rest of my memory. Spenc. Let's heare some of your novelties. Clem. First and foremost I have observed the wisdome of these Moors, for some two dayes since being invited to one of the chief Bashaws to dinner, after meat, sitting by a huge fire, and feeling his shins to burn, I requested him to pull back his chaire, but he very understandingly sent for three or four Masons and removed the chimney: the same Morian intreated me to lie with him, and I according to the state of my travells, willing to have a candle burning by, but he by no meanes would grant it; I ask't him why? No, sayes he, wee'll put out the light that the fleas may not know where to finde us. Enter Goodlack and Ruffman. Spenc. No storm at sea could be so tyranous, Nor half th'affright beare in his forehead bare, As I spie in that look. Besse. Let not your looks presage more terrours then Your tongues can speak; out with't at once Lieutenant. Spenc. Captain speak. Goodl. W'are all lost. Ruff. All shipwrak't. Clem. Are we ashore, and shall wee be cast away? Spenc. Great Mullisheg is royall. Goodl. False to you. Besse. Gratious and kinde. Ruff. Disloyall to us all. Spenc. Wrap me not in these wonders worthy friend, The very doubt of what the danger is, Is more then danger can be. Bess. Be it death, So we may dye together: heer's a heart Fear never could affright. Goodl. The king still loves your Besse. Spenc. Ha? Ruff. The Queen your Spencer. Bess. How? Goodl. This night he must enjoy her. Ruff. And she him. Spenc. A thousand deaths are in that word contriv'd. Ile make my passage through the blood of kings, Rather then suffer this. Bess. I through hell, Or were there place more dangerous. Goodl. Else all die. Clem. Die, 'sfoot this is worse then being made an Eunuch as I was. Spenc. We have yet life, and therefore cherish hope. Goodl. All hopes are banisht in the deep abysse Of our perplexed thoughts. Ruff. All things run retrograde. Bess. Why Captain? why Lieutenant? had you the skill To bring my ship thus far, to wrack her here? Past you the Ocean, to perish in the harbour? Thou, Tom Goodlack Wert ever true and just to my designes, And canst thou fail me now? Goodl. I studie for you. Bess. Hast thou brought me but to see my Spencers shadow, And not enjoy the substance: for what more Have I yet had from him, then from his picture, That once hung in my Chamber. Gentlemen, amongst you all Rescue an innocent maid from violence: Or do but say it cannot be prevented. I begin, he that best loves me follow. Spenc. What means Besse? Goodl. If it could be fashion'd to my thoughts, And have successe, 'twere brave. Spenc. What, noble friend? Goodl. To thrive but as we purpose. Spenc. Have you way? Goodl. 'Tis but a desperate course; and if it fail The worst can be but death: and I, even I, That laid the plot, will teach them how to dye. Ile lead them on. Spenc. If thou hast any project. Bess. Ioy or comfort. Ruff. And if not comfort, counsell. Goodl. Say it thrive? Spenc. What Captain? what? Goodl. You'l rip it from the wombe Ere it be fully hatch't now: If it prosper but to my desire And wishes, 'twere admirable. Spenc. No longer hold us in suspence, good Captain. But free us from these fears. Goodl. You noble friend, This night cast gracious eyes upon the Queen: Bess. And prove to me disloyall? Goodl. Still you crosse me, And make the birth abortive. You fair Besse, With amourous favours entertain the King. Spenc. And yeeld her self to his intemperate lust? Goodl. You still prevent me; either give me way To shew you light unto your liberties, Or still remain in darknesse. Ruff. Heare him out. Goodl. You sooth the Queen, Ile flatter with the King, Let's promise fayre on both sides; say, 'tis done All to their own desires. Spenc. The event of this? Goodl. A happy freedome, with a safe escape Vnto our ship this night. Bess. Oh, could this be. Goodl. Fortune assists the valiant and the bold, Wee'll bid fare for't. I had forgot my self, Wher's Clem? Clem. Noble Captain. Goodl. Post to the ship, bid Forset man the long Boat With ten good Musketiers, and at a watchword, If we can free our passage, take us in. Nay, make haste, one minuts stay is death. Clem. I am gone in a twinkling. Goodl. To compasse the Kings signet; then to command Our passage, scape the gates and watches too: For that I have brain. The King's upon his entrance; Howers wast, revells come on, a thousand projects Of death, hopes, and fears, are warring In my bosome, and at once. Eye you the Queen, and humour you the King; Let no distast nor discontented brow Appeare in you: their lust Ile make the ground, To set all free, or keep your honour sound. Disperse, the King's on comming. Flourish. Enter Mullisheg, Tota, Ioffer, and Alcade. Mull. We consecrate this evening, beautious Bride, To'th honour of your nuptialls.âIs all done? Goodl. Done. Tot. Is he ours? Ruff. Yours. Tot. And wee ever thine. Goodl. I, and so cast, that she shall grasp you freely; And think she hugs her Spencer. Ruff. And when he bosoms you, thinkes he infolds His lovely Besse. Tot. Thou mak'st a Queen thy servant. Goodl. Your highnesse Signet to command our passage from chamber to chamber. Mull. 'Tis there. Goodl. The word. Mull. 'Tis Mullisheg. Goodl. This must bring us safe aboard. Mull. We keep the Bride Too long from rest now, she is free for bed. Tot. Please her to accept it, In honour of her beauty, this night Ile do her any service. Besse. Mighty princesse, Excuse my breeding from such arrogance, And overbold presumption, you nor yours Can owe me any duty: 'tis besides The fashion of our countrey, not to trust The secrets of a nuptiall night like this, To the eyes of any stranger. Tot. At your pleasure, Bess. With our first nights unlacing, mighty Queen, We dare not trust our husbands, 'tis a modestie Our English maids professe. Mull. Keep your own customes as you shall think best, So for this night we leave you to your rest. Tot. Remember. Ruff. 'Tis writ here. Mull. Captain, Exeunt. Manet Goodlack. Goodl. I am fast, Now is my task in labour, and is plung'd In thousand throes of childebirth, dangerous it is To deal where kings affaires are questiond, Or may be parled. But what's he so base, That would not all his utmost powers extend, For freedome of his countrey and his friend. When all the Court is silent, sunk in dreams, Then must my spirits awake. By this the King H'as tane his leave of bride and bridegrome too: And th'amorous Queen longs for some happy news From Ruffman, as great Fesse expects from us. My friend and Besse wrapt in a thousand fears, To finde my plot in action: and it now Must take new life: auspitious fate thy aide, To guard the honour of this English maid. Exit. Enter Ruffman ushuring the Queen. Ruff. Tread soft, good Madam. Tot. Is this the Chamber. Ruff. Ile bring him instantly. He thinks this bed provided for his Besse, And that she lodges here, while she poore soul Embraceth nought but ayre. Tot. Thou mak'st a Queen thy servant. Ruff. Beware, be not too loud lest that your tongue Betraies you. Tot. Mute as night, As silent and as secret. Wrongs should be Paid with wrongs, for so indeed 'tis meet, My just revenge, though secret yet 'tis sweet. Haste time, and hast our bounty. Ruff. Queen I shall. So now were we all safe and in our Negro shipt, Might'st thou lie there till dooms day, lustfull Queen. Exit. Enter Goodlack and the King. Goodl. My lord the custome is in England still For maids to go to bed before their husbands, It saves their cheek from many a modest blush. King. And in the dark. Goodl. We use it for the most part. King. Soft may their bones lie in their beds of ashes That brought this custome into England first. Goodl. This the place where Besse expects her Spencer. King. Thou Viceroy of Argiers, for Captain, that Is now thy title: thou hast won a King, To be thy breast companion. Goodl. Not too loud. Why enters not your highnesse? you are safe. King. With as much joy as to our prophets rest. But what thinks Spencer of this? Goodl. I have shifted in her place A certain Moor, whom I have hir'd for money, Which (poore soul) he entertains for Besse. King. My excellent friend. Goodl. Beware of conference, lest your tongue reveals What this safe darknesse hides. King. I am all silent. Oh, thou contentfull night, into thy arms, Of all that ere I tasted, sweetest and best, I throw me, more for pleasure then for rest. Exit King. Goodl. One fury claspe another, and there beget Young devills between you: so fair Besse be safe. I have here the kings signet, this will yeeld us Way through the court and city, Besse being mask't, How can she be discride, when none suspect, Our flight this day not dream't on: now to execute What was before purpos'd, which if it speed, Ile say the heavens have in our fates agreed. Exit. Enter Besse, Spencer, and Ruffman. Spenc. How goes the night? Ruff. Tis some two howers from day. Besse. Yet no news from the Captain. Ruff. I have done a Midwives part, I have brought the Queen to bed, I could do no more. Enter Goodlack. Spenc. The Captain is come. Besse. Thy news. Goodl. All safe, faith wench, I have put them to it for a single combate, I have left them at it. Besse. King and Queen. Goodl. The same. Ruff. Now for us. Goodl. I, ther's all the danger, ther's one Bashaw Whose eyes is fixt on Spencer, and he now Walks e'ne before our lodging. Besse. Then what's past, Is all yet to no purpose. Goodl. He and I May freely passe the Court: and you fair Besse, I would disguise: but then for Spencer? Besse Why that's the main of all: all without his freedome That we can aime at's, nothing. Spenc. It shall be thus, which alter none that loves me. With this signet you three shall passe to'th ship Whil'st I'me in sight she will not be suspected: My escape, leaue to my own fair fortunes. Besse. How that? Spenc. Through twenty Bashaws I will hew my way, But I will see thee e're morning. Besse. Think'st thou Spencer That I will leave thee? thinkst thou that I can? Thou maist as well part body from the soul, As part us now: It is our wedding night, Would'st now divide us? Spenc. Yeeld to times necessities, and to our strict disasters. Goodl. Words are vain, We now must cleave to action: our stay's death, And if we be not quick in expedition, We all perish. Spenc. Besse, be swaid. Besse. To go to sea without thee, And leave thee subject unto a tyrants cruelty? Ile dye a thousand deaths first. Spenc. First save one, And by degrees the rest. When thou hast past The perills of this night, I am half safe, But whilst thou art still invirond, more then better Half of my part's indanger'd. Goodl. Talk your selves To your deaths, do: will you venter forth? Leave me to the Bashaw. Ruff. Or me, Ile buffet with him for my passage. Spenc. Neither, in what I purpose I am constant. Conduct her safe; th'advantage of the night Ile take for my escape: and my sweet Besse, If in the morning I behold thee not Safe within my Negro, be assur'd I am dead. Nay, now delaies are vain. Besse. Sir, did you love Me, you would not stay behinde me. Spenc. Ile ha't so. Gentlemen, be charie of this jewell That throws her self into the armes of night, Vnder your conduct. If I live, my Besse, To morrow Ile not fail thee. Besse. And if thou diest to morrow, be assur'd To morrow Ile be with thee. Spenc. Shall thy love Betray us all to death. Besse. Well, I will go, But if thou dost miscary, think the Ocean To be my Bride-bed. Spenc. Heaven for us, That power that hath preserv'd us hitherto, Will not let's sink now. And, brave gentlemen, Of the Moors bounty beare not any thing Vnto our ship, lest they report of us, We fled by night and rob'd them. Goodl. Nobly resolv'd. Spenc. Now embrace and part; and my sweet Besse, This be thy comfort gainst all future fears, To meet in mirth that now divide in tears: Farewell Besse, Ile back into my chamber. Besse. Can I part with life In more distracted horrour? Goodl. You spoil all. That we before have plotted. Will you mask your self, and to the Porter first. Ho, Porter. Enter Porter. Porter. Who calls? Goodl. One from the King. Porter. How shall I know that? Goodl. This token be your warrnt, behold his signet. That's not enough, the Word. Goodl. Mullisheg. Port. Passe freely: some weighty buisinesse is in hand That the kings signet is abroad so late; But no matter, this is my discharge, Ile to my rest. Exit Porter. Enter Alcade. Alcad. I much suspect, These English 'mongst themselves are treacherous: I have observ'd, the king had conference with the Captain: many whisperings and passages I have observed, but that which makes me most suspect is, because the king hath removed his lodging, and it may be to prostitude the English Maid: Ha, suspect said I; nay, examine things exactly, and 'tmust needs be so, the king is wondrous bountifull, and what i'st gold cannot. Troth I could even pitty the poore forlorn Englishman, who this night must be forc't lie alone, and have the king taste to him. Enter Spencer. Spenc. Sure this Moore hath been made private to the Kings intents, which if I finde, Ile make him the instrument for me to passe the Court gates. This man, whose office was to keep me, shall be the onely means to free me. Alcad. On his marriage night, and up at this hower? nay, if I once suspect, 'tis as firme as if it were confirmed by Alkaron, or Mahomet himself had sworn it: Ile sport my self with his distast and sorrow. Spenc. Thus abus'd. Alcad. What up so late and on your bridall night When you should lie lul'd in the fast imbrace Of your fair Mistrisse. I hope I have given't him soundly. Spenc. s'possible, To lodge my bride in one place, and dispose me To a wrong chamber: she not once send to me, That I might know to finde her. Alcad. Excellent. Nay, if I once suspect, it never fails. Spenc. Ile not tak't At th'hands of an Empresse, much lesse at hers. Alcad. Why, what's the businesse, Sir? Oh, I guesse the cause of your griefe. Spenc. And Sir, you may, but Ile be reveng'd. Alcad. Troth and I would. Spenc. Ile bosome some body, Be it the common'st Curtezan in Fesse, If not for love, to vex her. Alcad. Can you do lesse? Spenc. To leave me the first night. Alcad. Oh, 'twas a signe she never dearly lov'd you. Spenc. I perceive Bashaw Alcade you understand my wrongs. Alcad. In part, though not in whol. Spenc. Your word is warrant, passe me the court gate, Ile to some loose Burdello, and tell her when I have done. Alcad. Were it my cause, Ide do this, and more. Spenc. Make me wait thus! Alcad. Oh Sir, 'tis insufferable. Spenc. Troth I dally my revenge too long, what ho, Port. How now, who calls? Porter. Alcad. Her's Bashaw Alcade, turn the key. Port. His name commands my gate, passe freely. Spenc. Sir, I am bound to you, To take this wrong I should be held no man. Now to the watch, scape there as I can. Exit. Alcad. Ha, ha, so long as she sleeps in the arms of Fesse, let him pack where he pleases: Porter, now hee's without, let him command his entrance no more, neither for reward nor intreaty, till day breaks. Port. Sir, he shall not. Alcad. 'Tis well we are so rid of him: Mullisheg will give me great thanks for this. Ile to his chamber, there attend without, Till he shall waken from his drowsie rest, And then acquaint him with this fortunate jest. Alarum. Enter Ioffer, Lieutenant, Spencer prisoner and wounded. Ioff. Sir, though we wonder at your noble deeds, Yet I must do the office of a subject, And take you prisoner: by that noble blood That runs in these my veins, when I behold The slaughter you have made, which wonders me, I wish you had escapt, and not been made captive To him, who though he may admire and love you, Yet cannot help you. Spenc. Your stile is like your birth, for you are Ioffer, Chief Bashaw to the king, and him I know Lord of most noble thoughts. Speak, what's my danger? Ioff. Know Sir, a double forfeit of your life: Your outrage first is death, being in the night, And gainst the watch; but those that you have slain In this fierce conflict, brings 'em without all bounds Of pardon. Spenc. I was born too't, and I embrace my fortune. Ioff. Sir, now I know you To be that brave and worthy Englishman, So highly grac't in court, which more amazeth me That you should thus requite him with the slaughter Of his lou'd subjects. Spenc. I intreat you Sir, As you are noble question me no further, I have many private thoughts that trouble me, And not the fear of death. Ioff. We know your name, and now have prov'd your courage, Both these moves us to give you as easie bondage as our loyalty To the king can suffer, you are free From irons. Spenc. When this news shall come to her, Ioff. Lieutenant, lead the watch some distance of, Bid them remove these bodies lately slain, I must have private conference with this prisoner, Leave him to my charge. Sir think me though a Moore, A nation strange unto you Christians, Yet that I can be noble: but in you I have observ'd strange contrarieties, Which I would be resolv'd in. Spenc. Speak your thoughts. Ioff. When I confer'd the noblenesse of your blood, With this your present passion, I much muse, Why either such a small effuse of blood, These your sleight wounds, or the pale fear of death, Should have the power to force a teare from such A noble eye. Spenc. Why thinkst thou Bashaw That wounds, blood, or death Could force a teare from me, thou noblest of thy nation, Do not so farre misprise me: I tell thee Bashaw, The rack, strapado, or the scalding oyl, The burning pincers, or the boyling lead, The stakes, the pikes, the caldron, or the wheel, Were all these tortures to be felt an once, Could not draw water hence. Ioff. Whence comes it then? Spenc. From that whose pains as far surmounts all those As whips of furies do the Ladies fans, Made of the plumes o'th Estridge: this like the Sunne, Extracts the dew from my declining soul, And swims mine eyes in moist effeminacie. O Besse, Besse, Besse, Besse. Ioff. Dead pitty you have wakened in my bosome, And made me with you like compassionate. Freely relate your sorrows. Spenc. Sir, I shall: If you have ever loved, or such a maid, So fair, so constant, and so chast as mine, And should fortune to lamentable fortune, Betray her to a black abortive fate, How would it wring you? Or if you had a heart, Made of that mettall that we white men have, How would it melt in you? Ioff. Sir, you confound me. Spenc. I will be brief; the travells of my Besse, To finde me out, you have pertook at full, In presence of the King, these I omit. Now when we came to summe up all our joy, And this night were entring to our hoped blisse, The king, Oh most unworthy of that name, He quite fell off from goodnesse. Ioff. Who Mullisheg? Spenc. His lust out-waid his honour: and as if his soul Were blacker then his face, he laid plots To take this sweet night from me: but prevented, I have convai'd my beautious bride aboard, My Captain and Lieutenant. Ioff. Are they escapt? Spenc. Safe to my Negro. Thus farre fortune led me Through many dangers till I past this bridge, The last of all your watches. And muse not Bashaw, that I thus single durst oppose my self, I wore my Mistris here, and she, not I, Made me midway a conquerour. Ioff. She being at sea, And safe, why should your own fates trouble you? Spenc. Renowned Moor, there is your greatest errour; When, we parted, I swore by the honour of a Gentleman, And as I ever was her constant friend, If I surviv'd, to visit her aboard By such an houre: but if I fail, that she Should think me dead: now, if I break one minute, She leaps into the sea: 'tis this, great Bashaw, That from a souldiers eyes draws pearly tears: For my own person I despise all fears. Ioff. You have deeply touch't me: and to let you know All morrall vertues are not solely grounded In th'hearts of Christians, go and passe free; Keep your appointed houre, preserve her life: I will conduct you past all danger: but withall Remember my head's left to answer it. Spenc. Is honour fled from Christians unto Moors, That I may say in Barbarie I found This rare black Swan. Ioff. And when you are at sea, The winde no question may blow fair, your ankors They are soon waid, and you have sea-roome free To passe unto your countrey: 'tis but my life, And I shall think it nobly spent to save you, Her, and your train from many sad disasters. Spenc. Sir, I thank you, Appoint me a fixt hower, if I return not, May I be held a scorn to Christendome, And recreant to my countrey. Ioff. By three to morrow. Spenc. Binde me by some oath. Ioff. Onely your hand and word. Spenc. Which if I break. What my heart thinks, my tongue forbears to speak. Ioff. Ile bear you past all watches. Exeunt. Explicit Actus secundus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus tertius. Scena prima. Enter Mullisheg. Mull. Through satiate with the pleasures of this night, The morning calls me from the sweet embraces Of the fair English Damsell. Tot. The English stranger Is stoln from forth mine arms. I am at full revenged: Were I again to match, Ide marry one Of this brave nation, if a Gentleman, Before the greatest Monarch of the world, They are such sweet and loving bedfellows. Now to my chamber, darknesse guid my way, Lest what none yet suspect, the night betray. Let all like me wrong'd in their nuptiall bed, Not aim at th'heart, but rather strike at th'head. Mul. Venetian Ladies, nor the Persian Girles, The French, the Spanish, nor the Turkish Dames, Ethiope nor Greece can kisse with half that art These English can, nor entertain their friends With 'tenth part of that ample willingnesse Within their arms. Alcad. Your highnesse cal'd? Mul. To tell thee that none shall pertake but thou. Oh, I have had the sweetest nights content That ever king enjoy'd. Alcad. With the fair English bride. Mull. Nor envy if I raise the Captain for't, For he shall mount. Alcad. And he deserves it: but to me you owe Part of that honour, I had a hand in't too, Although perhaps you thought me ignorant In what is past. Mul. Hadst thou no more Then half a finger in this nights content, It shall not be forgot, but thou as he Shalt be rais'd one step higher. Alc. Observing what had past, I spide the bridegroom. As still mine eies were fixt on him, up and late, Then by a trick, a pretty sleight, a fine fetch of mine own, I past him forth the gates, and gave command, He should not have his entrance back again, Neither for reward nor intreaties, till day broke. Mull. Your aim in that? Alc. For fear lest he by some suspitious jealousie Should have disturb'd your rest. Mull. Thy providence Shall not die unrewarded: shift him hence, And with his will too, this makes thee Of our counsell. Alcad. 'Tis an honour My wisedome haih long aim'd at, and I hope Now shall receive his merit. Enter a Negro. Negr. Pardon great king that I thus rudely presse Into your private bed-chamber. Mull. Speak, thy news. Negr. The English Captain, with the lovely Bride, With her Lieutenant hath secretly this night, With your highnesse signet and the word past the Court-gates, past all the watches, and got aboard their Negro, and I was sent to know your highnesse pleasure. Mull. Ha, this night? Alcade, seek, search, I left her sleeping in our royall bed. Alcad. I shall my lord, I half suspect. Mull. But was not Spencer with them? Negr. Onely they three: and we, by vertue of your highnesse signet, past them the court-gates without trouble. Enter Alcad. Mull. We are amazed: Alcade, whom find'st thou there? Alcad. Nothing, my lord, but empty sheets, A bed new tost; but neither English Lady, nor any Lady else. Mul. We stand astonish't, Not knowing what to answer. Enter a second messenger. Mess. Pardon great king if I relate the news That will offend you highly. Mull. That the English Captain, Lady, and Lieutenant are escapt. Mess. But that's not all. Mull. Can there be worse behinde? Mess. Yes, if the losse of your dear subjects lives Be worse then their escape: Spencer, without The signet or the word, being left behinde. Mull. You cal'd the porter up And let him after. Alcad. Pardon great King. Mull. Was this your trick, your sleight, your stratagem? As we are king of Fesse, thy life shall pay The forfet, thine own tongue shall sentence thee. But to the rest. Mess. Then past he to the bridge, Where stood armed men, in number fourty: Maugre all their strength, with his good sword He would have made through all: And in this fierce conflict, six, to the maze Of all the rest, were slain: nor would he yeeld, Till suddenly we rais'd a loud alarm, At which the Captain of the watch came down, And so there surpriz'd him. Mul. Is he prisoner then? Mess. In custody of the great Bashaw Ioffer, With whom we left him. Mull. Command our Bashaw To bring him clog'd in irons. These English Pirates Have rob'd us of much treasure: and for that His traiterous life shall answer. But for thee, traitor, That had'st a hand in his escape, Thou shalt be sure to pay for't. Alcad. Alas, my lord, What I did was meerly ignorance. Mull. Nay bribes, And I shall finde it so: bear him to guard. What dissolute strumpet did that traitrous Captain Send to our sheets; but all our injuries, Vpon that English prisoner wee'll revenge, As we in state and fortune hope to rise, A never heard of death that traitour dies. Enter Captain, Besse, Ruffman, Clem. Besse. No news from Forset yet that waits for Spencer, The long boat's not return'd? Goodl. Not yet? Besse. Clem. to the main top Clem, and give us notice if thou seest any (like them) make from the shore; the day is broke already. Clem. With all my heart, so you will give me warning before the Gunner shoots, lest I tumble down again, and put my neck a second time in danger. Besse. Prethee be gon, let's have no jesting now. Clem. Then Ile to the main top in earnest. Goodl. How fares it with you Besse? Besse. Like a hartlesse creature, a body without motion. How can I chose when I am come to sea, And left my heart ashore? What, no news yet? Goodl. None. Bess. I prethee Ruffman step into my Cabin, and bring me here my houre glasse. Ruff. That I shall. Goodl. To what end would you use it? Bess. Shall I tell thee Captain, I would know how long I have to live: That glasse once turn'd, the sandy houre quite run, I know my Spencer's dead, and my life's donne. Enter Ruffman with the glasse. Ruff. Your glasse. Besse. Gramercy good Lieutenant: 'Tis better then a gaudy looking glasse, To deck our faces in; that shews our pride, But this our ends those glasses seek to hide. Have you been all at prayers? Both. We have. Besse. I thank you Gentlemen, never more need: and you would say As I do, did you but know how near our ends some are. Dost thou not think, Captain, my Spencer's slain? Goodl. Yet hope the best. Besse. This is the hower he promist: Captain, look, For I have not the heart, and truely tell me How farre 'tis spent Some fifteen minutes. Besse. Alas, no more; I prethee tak't away, Even just so many haue I left to pray, And then to break my heart strings: None that loves me Speake one word to me of him, or any thing: If in your secret cabbins you'l bestow Of him and me some tears and hearty prayers, We, if we live shall thank you. Good Gentlemen Ingage me so far to you. Enter Clem. Clem. News, news, news. Besse. Ha, good or bad. Clem. Excellent, most excellent, nay, super excellent, Forset and all his companions are rowing hither like mad men; and there is one that sits i'th stern and does not row at all, and that is, let me see who is it? I am sure 'tis he, noble Spencer. Besse. Spencer? Heart, let me keep thee; thou wast up to heaven Half way in rapture. Art thou sure? Clem. I think you'l make a man swear his heart out. Besse. Teach me but how I shall receive him when he comes aboard; How shall I beare me, Captain, that my joy Do not transcend my soul out of this earth, Into the aire with passionate extasie: Enter Spencer. Goodl. Now farewell Barbarie, king Mullisheg, We have sea room, and winde at will, not ten Of thy best Gallies arm'd with Moors, Can fetch us back. Ruff. For England Gentlemen. Bess. Oh, wher's the Gunner: See all the ordnance be straight discharged For joy my Spencer lives; let's mist our selves In a thick cloud of smoak, and speak our joyes Vnto the highest heavens in fire, and thunder. Ruff. To make the Queen vex and torment her self. Besse. To make the King tear his contorted locks, Curl'd like the knots of furies: Oh this musick Doth please me better then th'effeminate strings, Tun'd to their wilde Moriskoes: dance my soul, And caper in my bosome, joyfull heart, That I have here my Spencer. Goodl. Come, waigh Anchor, Hoist sail, we have a fair and gentle gale To beare us to our countrey. Spenc. Captain, stay. Besse. I did not heare my Spencer speak till now, Nor would my sudden joy give me that judgement To spie that sadnesse in thee I now see; Good, what's the cause, canst thou conceal't from me? What, from thy Besse? Whence came that sigh? You will not tell me; no, do not: I am not worthy to partake your thoughts. Do you repent you that you see us safe Imbar'kt for England to enjoy me there: Is there some other whom you better love? Let me but know her, and for your sweet sake Ile serve her too: come, I will know the cause. Spenc. Know all in one: Now I have seen you, I must leave you Besse. Besse. Leave me? Oh, fatall. Spenc. Speak, my Besse, it is thy Spencer tells thee. Besse. That he will leave me: if the same tongue That wounded me, gives me no present cure, It will again intrance me. Spenc. Arm your self, It must be spoke again, for I must leave you. My honour, faith, and countrey are ingag'd, The reputation of a Christian's pawn'd; And all that weare that sacred livery, Shall in my breach be scandal'd. Moors will say, We boast of faith, none does good works but they. Besse. I am nor sleep nor waking, but my senses All in a confus'd slumber. Goodl. Sir, resolve us; You wrap us in a Labyrinth of doubts, From which I pray unloose us. Spenc. I shall; I made my way through slaughter; but at length The watch came down and took me prisoner Vnto a noble Bashaw: for my valour, It pleas'd him to admire me: but when sorrow To disappoint my Besse, strok me in passion, He urg'd me freely to relate my griefs, Which took in him such deep impression, That on my word and promise to return By such an hower, he left himself in hostage, To give me my desires. Goodl. 'Twas nobly done. But what's the lives of twenty thousand Moors, To one that is a Christian? Ruff. We have liberty, and free way to our countrey, Shall not we take th'advantage that the heavens Have lent us: but now, as if we scorn'd Their gracious bounty, give up our selves To voluntary bondage. Bess. Prize you my love no better, then to rate it Beneath the friendship of a barbarous Moor? Can you, to save him, leave me to my death? Is this The just reward of all my travells? Spenc. I prize my honour, and a Christians faith, Above what earth can yeeld: shall Fesse report, Vnto our countreys shame, and to the scandall Of our religion, that a barbarous Moor Can exceed us in noblenesse? no, Ile die A hundred thousand deaths first. Besse. Oh, my fate, was ever maid thus crost, That have so oft been brought to see my blisse, And never taste it? to meet my Spencer living after death, To joyn with him in marriage, not enjoy him? To have him here free from the barbarous Moors, And now to lose him? being so oft rais'd Vnto the height of all felicity To make my ruine greater. If you needs Will hazzard your own person, make me partner In this thy present danger; take me with thee. Spenc. Not for the world, no living soul shall bleed One drop for me. Besse. Canst thou be so unkinde? then false man know, That thou hast taught me harshnesse. I without Thee came to Momarah, and to my countrey back, I will return without thee: I am here In mine own vessell, mine own train about me: And since thou wilt forsake me, to embrace The Queen of Moors: though coyning strange excuse. E'ne at thy pleasure be it, my waie's into my countrey, Farewell, Ile not shed one tear more. Spenc. My partings death, But honour wakens me, the hower draws nigh, And if I fail one minut, he must die. The long boat now. Farewell Besse. Exit. Besse. Why, farewell Spencer, I alwaies lov'd thee but too well, Captain, thine eare, This I have vow'd, and this you all shall swear. Exeunt. Enter Mullisheg, Queen, Ioffer, Headsman. Mull. Produce your prisoner, Bashaw. Ioff. Mighty King, Had you beheld his prowesse, and withall, But seen his passions, you would then like me, Have pittied his diasters. Mull. We know no pitty for an injury Of that high nature, more then our revenge, We have vow'd his death, and he shall therefore die. Go, bring him forth. Ioff. Spare me, my lord; but some few howers, I shall. Mull. The least delay is death. Ioff. Then know, my lord, he was my prisoner. Mull. How, was? and is not? Ioff. By promise. Mull. Not in gyves. Ioff. Hee's gyv'd to me by faith, but else at liberty. Mull. I pray unriddle us, and teach us that Which we desire to know, where is the English prisoner? Ioff. I presum'd, my lord, Such noble valour could not be log'd alone, Without some other vertues, faith and honour, Therefore I gave him freedome to his ship, Onely upon his promise to return; Now if there be such noblenesse in a Christian, Which being a Moor, I have exprest to him, He will not see me perish. Mull. Foolish Bashaw To jeast away thy head: you are all conspiratours Against our person: and you all shall die. Why? canst thou think a stranger so remote, Both in countrey and religion, being imbark't At sea, and under sail, free from our bands In the arms of his fair bride, His Captain and his saylors all aboard, Sea room and winde at will, and will return To expose all these to voluntary dangers, For a bare verball promise? Ioff. If he comes nor, Be this mine honour, King, that though I bleed, A Moor a Christian thus far did exceed. Mull. The hower is past, The Christian hath broke faith. Off with his head. Enter Spencer. Spenc. Yet come at last. Mull. Ist possible? Can England so farre distant harbour such noble vertues? Ioff. I beshrow you, Sir, You come unto your death, and you have tane Much honour from me, and ingrost it all To your own fame; 'twould have lived longer by me, Then any monument can last, to have lost My life for such a noble stranger, Whose vertue even in this last act appears, I wish this blood, which now are friendly tears. You are come unto your death. Spenc. Why, 'twas my purpose; And by that death, to make my honour shine. Great Mullisheg, cherish this noble Moor, Whom all thy confines cannot parallell For vertue and true noblenesse. Ere my ship Should with such black dishonour beare me safe Into my countrey by thy Bashaws death, I would have bent my ordnance gainst her keel, And sunk her in the harbour. Mull. Thou hast slain Six of our subjects. Ioff. Oh, had you seen But with what eminent valour. Mull. Nought that's ill Can be well done: then Bashaw, speake no more, His life is meerly forfeit, and he shall pay it. Spenc. I am proud, Fesse, that I now owe thee nothing, But have in me ability to pay. If it be forfeit, take it, lay all on me, Ile pay the debt, then set the Bashaw free. Mull. Besides, misprising all our gracious favours, To violate our laws, infringe our peace, Disturbe our watch by night, and now perhaps Having rob'd us of much treasure, stoln to sea. Spenc. In that thou art not royall, Mullisheg. Of all thy gold and jewels lately given us, Ther's not a doit imbark't, For finding thee dishonourably unkinde, Scorning thy gold, we left it all behinde. Tot. If private men be lords of such brave spirits, How royall should their Princes be! Mull. Englishman, Ther's but one way for thee to save thy life, From eminent death. Spenc. Well, propose it. Mull. Instantly Send to thy Negro, and surrender up Thy Captain and thy fair Bride; otherwise, By all the holy rights of our great Prophet, Thou shalt not live an hower. Spenc. Alas, good King, I pitty and despise thy tyranny: Not live an hower? And when my head is off, What canst thou do then? Call'st thou that revenge, To ease me of a thousand turbulent griefs, And throw my soul in glory for my honour. Why, thou striv'st to make me happy but for her; Wert thou the King of all the kings on earth. Couldst thou lay all their scepters, roabs, and crowns, Here at my feet, and hadst power to install me Emperour of th'universall Emperie, Rather then yeeld my basest ship-boy up, To become thy slave; much lesse betray my Bride To thee and to thy bruitish lust, know king Of Fesse, I'de die a hundred thousand deaths first. Mull. Ile try your patience: Off with his head. Enter Besse, Goodlack, Ruffman. Besse. Her's more worke, stay. Spenc. What make you here? You wrong me above injury. Besse. If you loue blood, That river spare, and for him take a flood, Be but so gracious as save him alone, And great King see I bring thee three for one: Spare him, thou shalt have more, The lives of all my train, what saiest thou to't? And with their lives my ship and all to boot. Spenc. I could be angry with you above measure, In your four deaths I die, that had before Tasted but one. Mull. Captain, art thou there? how e're these fare, Thou shalt be sure to pay for't. Goodl. 'Tis my least care, What's done is mine, I here confes't, Then seize my life in ransome of the rest. Tot. Lieutenant, you are a base villane, What groom betrai'd you to our sheets? Ruff. Please keep your tongue, I did you no dishonour. Tot. Whom did you bring to our free embraces? Ruff. 'Twas the King, conceal what's past. Tot. How e're my minde, then yet my bodie's chast. Ruff. Make use on't. Spenc. Dismisse, great King, these to their ship again, My life is solely forfeit, take but that, I shall report thee mercifull. Besse. It were no justice, King, to forfeit his, And to spare mine, I am as deep as he, Since what my Spencer did was all for me. Goodl. Great King, if any faulted, then 'twas I, I led them on, and therefore first should die. Ruff. I am as deep as any. Ioff. Oh, had my head Excus'd all these, I had been nobly dead. Bess. Why pause you king? Is't by our noble vertes, That you have lost the use of speech? or can you think That Spencer dead, you might inherit me. No, first with Roman Portia I'de eate fire, Or with Lucretia character thy lust 'Twixt these two breasts. Stood I ingag'd to death. I'd scorn for life to bend a servile knee: But 'tis for thee, my Spencer, what was his fault? 'Twas but to saue his own, rescue his dear Bride From adulterate sheets, and must he die for this? Mull. Shall lust in me have chief predominance? And vertuous deeds, for which in Fesse I have been long renown'd, be quite exilde? Shall Christians have the honour To be sole heirs of goodnesse, and we Moors, Barbarous and bloody. Captain, resolve me, What common Curtezan didst thou convey Into our royall bed. Tot. I can excuse him, pardon me great King, I having private notice of your plots, Wrought him unto my purpose, and 'twas I lodg'd in your arms that night. Mull. These English ere in all things honourable, Nor can we tax their waies in any thing, Vnlesse we blame their vertues. English maid, We give thee once more back unto thy husband, Whom likewise freely we receive to grace: And as amends for our pretended wrongs, With her wee'll tender such an ample dower, As shall renown our bounty: but we fear We cannot recompence the injurious losse, Of your last nights expectations. Besse. 'Tis full amends, Where but the least part of your grace extends. Mull. Captain, we prize thy vertues to thy friends, Thy faith to us, and zeal unto our Queen. And Bashaw, for thy noblenesse to a Gentleman Of such approved valour and renown, We here create thee Viceroy of Argiers, And do esteem thee next our Queen in grace. Y'have quench't in me all lust, by which shall grow, Vertues which Fesse, and all the world shall know. Spenc. We shall report your bounties, and your royalties Shall flie through all the parts of Christendome. Bess. Whilst Besse has gold, which is the meed of baies, Shee'l make our English Poets tune thy praise. And now my Spencer, after all our troubles, Crosses and threatnings of the seas rough brow, I ne're could say thou wert mine own till now. Mull. Call this your harbour, and your haven of joy, For so wee'll strive to make it, noble strangers, Those vertues you have taught us by your deeds, We futurely will strive to imitate. And for the wrongs done to the hop't delights Of your lost nights divorce, double the magazine VVith which our larges should have sweld your ship. A golden Girl th'art cal'd, And wench, be bold, Thy lading back shall be with pearl and gold. Exeunt. Enter Chorus. Chor. Imagine Besse and Spencer under sail: But the intelligence of their great wealth, Being bruited 'mongst the Merchants, comes to'th eares Of a French Pirate, who with two ships well rig'd, Way laies them in their voyage: long they fought, And many slain on both sides; but the Frenchmen, Proud of their hopefull conquest, boarding twice, Are twice blown up, which addes courage to the English; But to the Frenchmen fear: just as they buckeld, Spencer and Goodlack, with two proofe Targets arm'd, Into the French ship leap, and on the hatches, There make a bloody slaughter: but at that instant, The billows swel'd, the windes grew high, and loud, And as the soul and body use to part, With no lesse force these lovers are divided, He wafts to her, and she makes signes to him: He calls, and she replies:âthey both grow hoarse, With shriking out their last farewell.ânow she swound: And sinks beneath the arms of Ruffman. Spencer, Vpon a Chest gets hold and safe arives I'th Marquis of Farara's countrey: the like adventure Chanc'd Goodlack, upon a Mast he pierces Italie, Where these two Dukes were then at ods. Spencer is chosen Farara's Champion: Mantua makes Goodlack his. What happen'd them if you desire to know, To cut off words, wee'll act it in dumb show. Dumb Show. The Dukes by them atton'd, they graced and prefer'd, Take their next way towards Florence. What of Besse, Ruffman, and Clem becomes, must next succeed. The seas to them like cruell proves, and wracks Their Negro on the coast of Florence, where They wander up and down 'mongst the Bandetties. More of their fortunes we will next pursue, In which we mean to be as brief as true. Exit. Explicit Actus tertius.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quartus. Scena prima. Enter Besse, Ruffman, and Clem. Besse. All is lost. Ruff. Save these our selves. Clem. For my part I have not so much left as a clean Shirt. Besse. And Spencer too, had the seas left me him, I should have thought them kinde, but in his fate, All wishes, fortunes, hopes of better daies Expire. Ruff. Spencer may live. Clem. I, that he may, if it be but in a sea-water green suit, as I was, among the haddocks. Besse. How many bitter plunges have I past, Ere I could win my Spencer? who no sooner Maried, but quite divorst, possest for some few daies, Then rent asunder, as soon a widow as I was a Bride: This day the mistris of many thousands, And a begger now, not worth the clothes I wear. Ruff. At the lowest ebbe The tides still flow, besides, being on the ground, Lower we cannot fall. Besse. Yes, into the ground, the grave. Ruffman, would I were there; till then I never Shall have true rest: I fain would know VVhat greater misery heaven can inflict, I have not yet Indur'd: if there be such, I dare it, let it come. Enter Captain Bandetties, and others. Band. Cease, and surprise the prisoners: thou art mine. Ruff. Villain, hands off, knowst thou whom thou offendest? Band. Binde her fast, and after captive him. Ruff. I will rather die Then suffer her sustein least injury. Ruffman is beaten off. Besse. VVhat's thy purpose? Band. In all my travells, and my quest of blood, I ne're encountred such a beauteous prize: Heavens, if I thought you would accept his thanks That trades in deeds of hell, I would acknowledge My self in debt to you. Besse. VVhat's thy intent, Bold villein, that thou mak'st this preparation? Band. I intend to ravish thee. Besse. All goodnesse pardon me, and you blest heavens, VVhom I too boldly challeng'd for a misery Beyond my Spencers losse. VVhat, rape intended? I had not thought there had been such a mischief, Devis'd for wretched woman: ravish me? 'Tis beyond shipwrack, poverty, or death: It is a word invented first in hell, And by the devills first spew'd upon earth: Man could not have invented to have given Such letters sound. Band. I trifle howers too long, And now to my black purpose. Envious day, Gaze with thy open eyes on this nights work, For thus the Prologue to my lust begins. Besse. Help, murther, rape, murther. Band. Ile stop your mouth from bawling. Enter Duke of Florence, and a train, and Merchant. Flor. This way the cry came: rescue for the Lady, Hold thy desperate fury, and arm thy self For my encounter. Band. Hell prevented. Flor. Vnbinde that beautious Lady, and pursue The Ruffin; he that can bring his head shall have A thousand crowns propos'd for his reward: He should be Captain of those bloody theevs, That haunts our mountains, and of our dear subjects Hath oft made outrage. Go, see this proclaim'd. Besse. E're I, the happy wishes of my soul, My orizons to heaven, or make free tender Of a most bounden duty, grace my misery, To let me know, unto what worthy person, Of what degree or state, I owe the service Of a most wretched life, lest in my ignorance, I prove an heretick to all good manners, And harshly so offend. Flor. Fairest of thy sex, I need not question thine, Because I read a noblenesse in thy forehead; But to resolve thee, know, I am stil'd, The Duke Of Florence, and of this countrey Prince. Besse. Then from my knees I fall flat on my face, In bound obeysance. Flor. Rise, That earth's too base for such pure lips to kisse. They should rather joyn with a Princes, as at first Made for such use: nay, we will have it so. Merch. That Lady, if my memory be faithfull Vnto my judgement, I should have seen e're now, But where, what place, or in what countrey, now I cannot call to minde. Flor. Where were you bred? Besse. In England, royall Sir. Merch. In England? Flor. By what strange adventure then Happened you on these coasts? Besse. By shipwrack. Flor. Then churlish were the waves t'expose you to Such danger. Whence disimbark't you last? Besse. From Barberie. Flor. From Barberie? our Merchant, you came lately thence. Merch. 'Tis she, I now remember her, She did me a great curtesie, and I am proud, Fortune, how ever enemy to her, Has given me opportunity to make A just requitall. Flor. What occasion Fair Lady, being of such state and beauty, Drew you from your own countrey, to expose you To so long travell. Merch. Mighty Soveraign, Pardon my interuption, if I make bold To put your grace in minde of an English Virgin, So highly grac't by mighty Mullisheg. Flor. A legend, worthy to be writ in gold, Whose strangenesse seem'd at first to exceed belief; And had not thy approved honesty Commanded our attention, we should have doubted That thou therein hadst much hyperboliz'd. Merch. What would your grace give, To see that miracle of constancie, Shee who reliev'd so many Christian captives, Redeem'd so many of the Merchants goods, Beg'd of the king so many forfetures, Kept from the Gallies some, and some from slaughter, She whom the king of Fesse never denied, But she deni'd him love; whose chastity Conquer'd his lust, and maugre his incontinence, Made him admire hir vertues. Flor. The report Strikes us with wonder and amazement too: But to behold the creature were a project, Worthy a theatre of Emperours; Nay, gods themselves to be spectatours. March. Behold that wonder. Lady, know you me? Besse. Not I, I can assure you, Sir. March. Ile give you instance then; I was that Florentine: Who being in Fesse; for a strange outrage there, Six of my men were to the Gallies doom'd: But at your intercession to the king, Freely releast: for which, in this dejection, I pray accept these thousand crowns, to raise Your ruin'd fortunes. Besse. You are gratefull, Sir, beyond my merit Flor. I cannot blame great Fesse To become inamour'd on so fair a creature. You had a friend much grac'd by that same Moor, Whom, as our Merchant told us, you were espous'd to In the Court of Fesse, wher's he? Besse. I cannot speak it without tears. Flor. Why, is he dead? Besse. I cannot say he lives. Flor. How were you sever'd? Besse. It asks a sad relation. Flor. Wee'll finde a fitter time to hear't. But now, Augment your griefs no further: on what coast Pray, were you shipwrack't? Bess. Vpon these neighbouring shoars; where all the wealth I had from Barbarie is perish't in the sea. I that this morn commanded half a million, Have nothing now but this good merchants bounty. Flor. You are richer In our high favour, then all the royalty, Fesse could have crown'd your pearlesse beauty with: He gave you gold; but we your almost forfeit chastitie. Bess. A gift above the wealth of Barbarie. Flor. Conduct this Ladie to the City streight, And bear this our signet to our treasurer, Command for her ten thousand crowns immediately. Next to our wardrobe, and what choise of habit Best likes her, 'tis her own; Onely for all this grace, daign beauteous Lady, That I may call you servant. Besse. Pardon me, Sir, You are a Prince, and I am here your vassall. Flor. Merchant, As you respect our favour see this done. Besse. What must my next fall be? I that this morning Was rich in wealth and servants, and e're noon Commanded neither: and next doom'd to death; Not death alone, but death with infamy. But what's all this unto my Spencers losse? Flor. You to the City, wee'll pursue the chase. Madam, be comforted, wee'll send, or see you; All your fortunes are not extinct in shipwrack, The land affords you better if you'l be swai'd by us. As first you finde us, wee'll be still the same: Oft have I chac't nere found so fair a game. Exeunt. Enter Clem solus. Clem. Where are my Bashaw's now? Let me see, what shall I do? I have left my Mistrisse, where shall I have my wages? shee's peper'd by this: but if the Captain of the Bandetties had had but that grace and honour that I had when I was in Barbarie, he would not have been so lusty. She scapt drowning, which is the way of all fish, and by this is gone the way of all flesh. My Lieutenant hee's sure cut to pieces among the Bandetties, and so had I been, had not my Bakers legs stept a little aside. My noble Captain and Spencer, they are either drowned i'th tempest, or murthered by the Pirates, and none is left alive but I Clem, poor Clem: but poor Clem, how wilt thou do now? what trick have you to satisfie Colon, here in a strange Countrey? It is not now with me as when Andrea liv'd. Now I bethink me, I have a trade, and that, they say, will stick by a man when his friends fail him: the City is hard by, and Ile see and I can be entertained to my old trade of drawing wine: if't be but an under skinker, I care not, better do so then like a prodigall feed upon husks and acorns. Well, if I chance to lead my life under some happy signe, To my Countreymen still Ile fill the best wine. Exit. Enter Ruffman bleeding. Ruff. Wounded, but scapt with life: but Besses losse, that's it that grieves me inward: ravish't, perhaps, and murthered. Oh, if Spencer and Goodlack survive, how would they blame my cowardice? a threed spun, may be untwined, but things in nature done, undone can never be. Shee's lost, they are perish't, they are happy in their deaths, and I surviving left to the earth most miserable. No means to raise my self? I met a Pursuivant even now, proclaiming to the man could bring the head of the Bandetties Captain, for his reward a thousand crowns: If not for gain of gold, yet for he injur'd Besse, that shall be my next task: What though I die? Be this my comfort, that it chanc't me well, To perish by his hand by whom she fell. Exit. Enter Duke of Florence. Merchant. Flor. Our Merchant, have you done to'th English Lady As we commanded, did she take the gold? Merc. After many complements, circumstances, Modest refusalls, sometimes with repulse, I forc't on her your bounty: Had you seen What a bewitching art she striv'd to use, Betwixt deniall, and disdain; contempt and thankfulnesse, You would have said, that out of a meer scorn T'accept your gift, she exprest such gratitude, As would demand a double donative. Flor. And it has don't, it shall be doubl'd straight, Arising thence unto an infinite, If shee'll but grant us love. How for her habit? March. With an inforst will, wilfull constraint, And a meer kinde of glad necessity, She put it on but to lament the death Of her lost husband. Flor. Why, is he lost? Merch. By all conjectures never to be found. Flor. The lesse her hope is to recover him, The more our hopes remains to conquer her: Bear her from us this jewell, and withall Provide a banquet, bid her leave all mourning, This night in person we will visit her. Merch. I shall. Flor. Withall more gold. And if thou canst by way of conference, Get from her how she stands affected towards us: It shall not be the furthest way about To thy preferment and our speciall favour. Enter a messenger. Mess. The two bold Dukes of Mantua and Farara, after many bloody garboils have entred league: and within these two daies mean to visit Florence, to make your Court a witnesse of their late concluded amity. Flor. Wee'll receive them, As Princes that in this would honour us. Mess. These letters will speak further. Flor. Bear them streight Vnto our Secretarie, and withall, give order, That all our Court may shine in gold and pearl, They never could have come in a happier season, Then when the great and high magnificence, Without suspect we would have shown to her, Will be accounted honour done to them. In fates despight, we will not lose the honour of this night. Exit. Enter Spencer, Goodlack. Spenc. Farara was exceeding bountifull. Goodl. So was the Duke of Mantua. Had we staid Within their confines, we might even till death Have liv'd in their high favour. Spenc. Oh, but Captain, What would their Dukedomes gain me without Besse, Or all the world t'injoy it without her: Each passage of content or pleasing fortune, VVhen I record she has no part in it, Seems rather as an augmentation Of a more great disease. Goodl. This be your comfort, that by this Shee's best part of her way for England, whither She is richly bound, then where she is most hopelesse Of this your safety, VVith your survivall to receive us gladly VVith an abundant treasure. Spenc. But for that, I had sunk e're this beneath the weight of war. And chus'd an obscure death, before the glorie Of a renowned souldier. But we are now As farre as Florence onward of our way, VVere it best that we made tender of our service To the grand Duke? Goodl. 'Tis the greatest benefits of all our travells, to see forraigne Courts, and to discourse their fashions: let us by no means neglect that duty. Spenc. Where were we best to lodge? Goodl. Hard by is a Tavern, let's first drink there, and after make inquirie who's the best host for strangers. Spenc. Come ho, where be these Drawers? Enter a Drawer. Draw. Gentlemen, I draw none my self, but Ile send some. Enter Clem with wine. Clem. Welcome Gentlemen. Score a quart. Spenc. Ha? Goodl. How? Clem. No, no, I am an asse, a very animall, it cannot be. Spenc. Why dost thou bear the wine back, the slave thinks belike we have no money? Goodl. What dost thou think us to be such casher'd soldiers that we have no cash. Tush, it cannot be he. Spenc. How should he come here, set down the wine. Clem. I will, I will, sir. Score a quart ofâTricks, meer fantasmes. Shall I draw wine to shadows? so I might runne o'th score, and finde no substance to pay for it. Spenc. Left we not him a shipboard on his voyage towards England with my Goodl. With Besse, true, Sirra, set down the wine. Clem. Some Italian Mountebanks, upon my life, meer jugling. Goodl. Vpon my life 'tis Clem. Clem. Ca, Ca, Cap. Captain? Maister Spencer? Spenc. Clem? Clem. I am Clem. Spenc. And I am Spencer. Goodl. And I Goodlack, but cannot think thee Clem. Clem. Yes, I am Clem of Foy, the Bashaw of Barbarie, who from a Courtier of Fesse, am turn'd a Drawer in Florence: but let me clear my eies better; now I know you to be the same whose throats the Pirates would have cut, and have spoiled your drinkings. Spenc. Oh, tell us, and be brief in thy relation, What hapened you, after the sudden tempest Sever'd our ships? or what's become of Besse? Goodl. Where did our Negro touch? Clem. Ile give you a touch, take it as you will: The Negro and all that was in her was wrack't on the coast of of Florence, her, and all the wealth that was in her, all drownd i'th bottome of the sea. Spenc. No matter for the riches, wher's she, worth More then ship or goods? Goodl. Wher's Ruffman? for thou we see art safe. Spenc. Nay speak, wher's Besse? How my heart quails within me? Clem. She, Ruffman, and I were all cast ashore safe, like so many drowned Rats, where we were no sooner landed, but we were set upon by the Bandetties; where she was bound to a tree, and ready to be ravish't by the Captain of the Out-laws. Spenc. Oh, worse then shipwrack could be. Clem. I see Ruffman half cut in pieces with rescuing her, but whether the other half be alive or no, I cannot tell. For my one part, I made shift for one, my heels doing me better service then my hands: and comming to the City, having no other means to live by, got me to my old trade to draw wine, where I have the best wine in Florence for you Gentlemen. Spenc. Ravish't. Goodl. And Ruffman slain. Spenc. Oh, hard news: It frets all my blood, and strikes me stiffe with Horrour and amazement. Goodl. It strikes me Into a marble statue, for with such I have like sense and feeling. Spenc. Tell me Captain, Wilt thou give me leave at length to despair And kill my self: I will disclaim all further Friendship with thee, if thou perswad'st me live. Ravish't! Goodl. Perhaps attempted but prevented, Will you before you know the utmost certainty, Destroy your self? Spenc. What is this world? what's man? are we created Out of flint or iron, that we are made to bear this? Goodl. Comfort, Sir. Clem. Your onely way is to drink wine if you be in grief, for that's the onely way, the old proverb saies, to comfort the heart. Goodl. Hark where we lie, and I prethee Clem lets hear from thee, but now leave us. Clem. I will make bould inquire you out, and if you want mony (as many travellers may) as long as I have either credit, wages, or any coyne i'th world, you shall not want, as I am a true Eunuch. Exit Clem. Enter Florence ushuring Besse, Train. Goodl. Let's stand aside and suffer these Gallants passe, that with their state take a whol street before them. Flor. Our Coach, stay, wee'll back some half houre hence, Onely conduct this Lady to her lodging. Ha, started you, Sweet, whence fetcht You that sigh. Our train lead on, W'have other businesse now to think upon. Exeunt. Besse casts a jewell. Goodl. Sure this was some great Lady. Spenc. But observ'd you not this jewell that shee cast me? 'tis a rich one. Goodl. Believe me, worthy your wearing. Spenc. What might she be to whom I am thus bound? I'me here a stranger, never till this day Beheld I Florence, nor acquaintance, friend: Especially of Ladies. Goodl. By their train, The man that did support her by the arm Was of some speciall note; and she a Lady Nobly descended. Why should she throw you this, Being a meer stranger? Spenc. Ther's some mystery in't, If we could finde the depth on't, sure there is. Goodl. Perhaps some newly faln in love with you, Now at first sight, and hurl'd that as a favour. Spencer. Yet neither of us had or the wit or sense to enquire her name: Ile weare it openly and see if any Will challenge it: the way to know her best. Goodl. And I would so. Spenc. Ile truce a while with sorrow for my Besse, Till I finde th'event. Goodl. And at best leasure Tender our service to the Duke, Whom same reports to be a bounteous prince, And liberall to all strangers. Spenc. 'Tis decreedâ But howsoe're his favours he impart, My Besses losse will still sit near my heart. Exeunt. Flourish. Enter Florence, Mantua, Farara. Flo. This honour you have done me, worthy Princes, In leaving of your Courts to visit me, We reckon as a trophe of your loves, And shall remain a future monument, Of a more firme and perfect amitie. Mant. To you, as to the greatest, most honour'd, And most esteemed Prince of Italy, After a tedious opposition, And much effuse of blood, this Prince and I, Late reconcil'd, make a most happy tender Of our united league. Farar. Selecting you A royall witnesse of this union, Which to expresse, we come to feast with you, To sport and revell, and in full largesse, To spread our royall bounty through your Court. Flor. What neither letters nor Ambassadours, Solliciting by factions, or by friends, Heavens hand hath done by your more calmer temper. Mant. All resist alls, Quarells, and ripping up of injuries, Are smother'd in the ashes of our wrath, Whose fire is now extinct. Ferar. Which who so kindles, Let him be held a new Herostratus, Who was so hated throughout Ephesus, They held it death to name him. Flor. Nobly spoke. And now confederate Princes, you shall finde, By our rich entertainment, how w'esteem Your friendship. Speak, have we no Ladies here To entertain these princes? Enter Besse. Mant. Me thinks I spie one beauty in this place, Worth all the sights that I have seen before. I thinke, survay the spatious world abroad, You scarce can finde her equall. Farar. Had not wonder, And deep amazement curb'd my speech in, I had forestall'd this Prince in approbation Of her comparelesse beauty. Flor. Taste her Princes. This surfets me, and ads unto my love, That they should thus admire her. Matua. Beautious Lady, It is not my least honour to be first In this most wish'd sollicite. Besse. I stand a statue, And cannot move but by anothers will, And as I am commanded. Farar. I should have wrastled for priority, But that I hold it as a blessing, To take off that kisse which he so late laid on. Flor. Now tell me Princes, How do you like my judgement in the choice Of a fair mistrisse? Mant. You shall choose for me. Farar. More happy in this beauty, I account you, Then in your richest treasure. Flor. Wer't not clouded o're With such a melancholly sadnesse, I'de Not change it for the wealth of Italy. Sweet, cheer this brow whereon no frown can sit, But it will ill become you. Besse. Sir, I bleed. Flor. Ha, bleed? I would not have a sad and ominous fate Hang o're thee for a million: Perhaps 'tis custome with you. Besse. I have observed Even from my childehood, never fell from hence One crimson drop, but either my greatest enemy, Or my dearest friend was near. Flor. Why, we are here, First to thy side thy dearest friend on earth. If that be all, fear nothing. Besse. Pardon, Sir, Both modesty and manners pleads for me And I must needs retire. Flor. Our train attend her, Let her have all observance. By my royalty, I would not have her taste the least disaster For more then we can promise. Exit: Ferar. You have onely shewed us a rich Iewell, Sir, And put it in a casket. Mant. Of what countrey, Fortune, or birth doth she proclaim her self? For by her garb and language we may guesse, She was not bred in Florence. Flor. Seat you Princes, Ile tell you a strange project. Enter Spencer and Goodlack. Spenc. I have walk't the streets, but finde not any that will make challenge of this jewell. Captain, now wee'll try the Court. Goodl. Beware of these Italians, They are by nature jealous and revengefull, Not sparing the most basest opportunity, That may procure your danger. Spencer. Innocence Is bold and cannot fear. But see the Duke, Wee'll tender him the solemnst reverence Of travellers and strangers. Peace, prosperitie, And all good fates attend your royalty. Goodl. Behold, w'are two poor English Gentlemen, Whom travell hath enforc't through your Dukedome, As next way to our countrey, prostrate you Our lives and service: 'tis not for reward, Or hope of gain we make this tender to you, But our free loves. Flor. That which so freely comes, How can we scorn? what are you Gentlemen? Mant. Ile speak for this. Farar. And I for him, Well met renowned Englishman Here in the Court of Florence: this was he, Great Duke, whom fame hath for his valour blazon'd; Not onely through Mantua, But through the spatious bounds of Italie, Where 'twas shown. Ferar. Hath fame been so injurious to thy merit, That this great Court is not already fil'd With rumour of their matchlesse chevalrie. Flor. If these be they, as by their outward semblance, They promise not much lesse: fame hath been harbinger To speak their praise before hand. Noble Gentlemen, You have much grac't our Court; we thank you for't: And though no way according to your merits, Yet will we strive to cherish such brave spirits. Spenc. Th'acceptance of our smallest service, Sir, Is bounty above gold: w'are poor Gentlemen, And though we cannot, gladly would deserve. Goodl. 'Tas pleas'd these princes to bestow on us Too great a character: and gild our praises Far above our deserts. Flor. That's but your modesty. English Gentlemen, let fame speak for you. Farar. Gentlemen of England, we pardon you all duty, We accept you as our friends and our companions: Such you are, and such we do esteem you. Spencer. Mighty Prince, Such boldnesse wants excuse. Flor. Come wee'll ha't so. Amazement, can it be? Sure 'tis the self same jewell I gave the English Lady: more I view it, More it confirmes my knowledge: now is no time To question it, once more renowned Englishmen, Welcome to us and to these Princes. Enter Ruffman. Ruff. Can any man shew mee the great Duke of Florence? March. Behold the Prince. Ruff. Daigne, thou renowned Duke, to cast thy eyes Vpon a poor dejected Gentleman, Whom fortune hath dejected even to nothing. I have nor meat nor money; these rags are all my riches; Onely necessity compells me claim A debt owing by you. Flor. By us? Let's know the summe, and how the debt acrues. Ruff. You have proclaim'd to him could bring the head Of the Bandetties Captain, for his reward, A thousand crowns. Now I being a Gentleman, A traveller, and in want, made this my way To raise my ruin'd hope: I singled him, Fought with him hand to hand, and from his bloody shoulders Lopt this head. Flor. Boldly and bravely done: what e're thou be Thou shalt receive it from our treasurie. Ruff. You shew your self as fame reports you, A bounteous Prince, and liberall to all strangers. Flor. From what countrey Do you claim your birth? Ruff. From England, royall Sir! Flor. These bold Englishmen, I think are all compos'd of spirit and fire, The element of earth hath no part in them. Mant. If, as you say, from England, we retein Some of your Countreymen; know you these Gentlemen? Ruff. Let me no longer live in extasie, This wonder will confound me: Noble friends, Bootlesse it were to ask you why, because I finde you here. Illustrious Duke, you owe Me nothing now, to shew me these, is reward Beyond what you proclaim'd: the rest I pardon. Flor. What these are we know, And what thou art we need not question much, That head though mute can speak it. Princes, once more receive our royall welcome. Oh, but the jewell: but of that at leasure Now we cannot stay. Our train, lead on. Florish. Exeunt Dukes. Spenc. Oh, that we three so happily should meet, And want the fourth. Ruff. I left her in the hands of rape and murther, Whence, except some deity, 'Twas not in the power of man to rescue her; How ever, a good office I have done her, Which even in death her soul will thank me for, Reveng'd her on that villain. Goodl. It hath exprest the noblenesse of thy Spirit. For it we still shall owe thee. Ruff. But what adventure hath prefer'd you And brought you thus in grace? Goodl. You shall hereafter Pertake of that at large. But leaving this discourse, With our joynt perswasions let's strive to comfort him, That's nothing but discomfort. Ruff. Would I had brought him news of that rare vertue. Yet you have never heard of our late shipwrack. Goodl. Clem reported it. Ruff. How Clem, wher's he? Goodl. He has got a service hard by, and draws wine. Ruff. His master may well trust him with his maids, For since the Beshaws gelded him, he has learn'd To run exceeding nimbly. Enter Merchant. Merch. Sir, 'tis to you, I take it, My message is directed. The Duke would have some conference with you, but it must be in private. Spenc. I am his servant, still at his command. Where shall's meet anon. Goodl. At Clems. Spencer. Content. Goodl. Where wee'll make a due relation of all our desperate fortunes. Ruff. 'Tis concluded. Exeunt Explicit Actus quartus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quintus. Scena prima. Enter Duke of Florence and Spencer. Flor. I cannot rest till I am fully resolv'd About this jewell. Sir, we sent to stay you, And wean you some small season from your friends: And you above the rest, because your presence Doth promise good discourse. Spenc. Sir, I am all yours. Flor. How long hath been your sojourn here in Florence? Spencer. Two daies, no more. Flor. Have you since your arivall Retain'd no beauteous Mistrisse? Pardon me, Sir, that I am come thus near you. Spencer. On my soul Not any, royall Sir. Flor. Think it my love that I presume thus farre To question you. Have you observ'd no Ladie Of speciall note, courted or discourst with any Within these two daies. Spenc. Vpon my honour, none. Flor. You are a souldier and a Gentleman, And should speak all truth. Spenc. If otherwise, I should disclaim my gentry. Flor. I beleev you, Sir. You have a rich jewell here, Worthy a Princes wearing: twere not modestie To ask how you came by it, or from whom. Spenc. Nor can I, Sir, resolve you, if you did: But it was cast me by a Lady, of whom As then I took small notice of, my minde Being troubled. Flor. 'Tis even so. Spenc. Perhaps your grace by knowing of this jewell, May know the beauteous flinger, and so You might engage me deeply to acquaint me with her, To prove her gratefull debtor. Flor. No such thing, You know none in this Citie? Spenc. Worse then scorn, Or foul disgrace befall me if I know Any you can call woman. Flor. Be not moved, I spoke but this in sport. Sure this strange Lady, Casting her eye upon this Gentleman, Grew straight if him inamour'd, which makes her Keep off from my embraces: but Ile sound all, Yet my own wrongs prevent. Sir, I staid you, But to another purpose, to commit A weighty secret to you. Spenc. Wer't of millions, Ide prove your faithfull steward. Flor. I have a Mistrisse that I tender dearer Then mine own eyes. Observe me, dearer Sir, Whom neither courtship moves, favours can work, Nor no preferment tempt. Spenc. How rich were he Could call himself lord of such a jewell. Flor. My intreaties, friends, perswasions, importunities Of my chast Ladies cannot prevail at all. Now would I chose a stranger, selecting thee, To bear to her these few lines which contein The substance of my minde. Spencer. And Sir, I shall. Flor. In thy aspect I read a fortune that should destine me To strange felicities. Wilt thou be faithfull? Spenc. As to my soul. Flor. But thou shalt swear before thou undertak'st it, (Though I suspect not falshood in thy visage) Not once to cast on her an amourous look, Speak to her no familiar syllable, Not to embrace her, nor to kisse her hand, Nor her free lip by no means. Spenc. Well, I swear. Flor. But that's not all, Swear by thy faith and thy religion. Not to taste the least small fauour for thy self, Touch or come near her bosome; for, fair stranger, I love her above measure, and that love Makes me thus jealous. Spenc. By my honesty, Faith, and religion, without free release From your own lips, all this will I perform. Flor. And so return the richest Englishman, That ever pierst our Dukedome. Instantly Thou shalt about thy task. Exeunt. Enter Besse, Merchant. Besse. You have tir'd our ears with your long discourse Leave us to rest. Merch. Dream on your best desires. Besse. If at some half houre hence you visit us, We shall be free for language. Merch. Soft rest with you. Besse. If my soft sleeps presents me any shadow Oh, let it be my Spencers, him whom waking I cannot see, I may in dreams perhaps Converse with, my sudden bleeding and my drowsinesse, Should not presage me good: pray heaven the Duke Prove loyall to mine honour: howsoever Death will end all: and I presume on this 'Tis way to Spencer, and my haven of blisse. Shee lies to sleep. Enter Spencer. Spenc. What beauty should this be, on whom the Duke Is grown so jealous: sure 'tis some rare piece; He tould me she was fairer then I could either Iudge, Or yet imagine. Would Besse were here to wager beauties with her, For all my hopes in England. This is the Chamber: Ha, thus far off she seems to promise well, Ile take a nearer and more free survay, This taper shall assist me: fail my eies? Or meet I nothing else but prodigies? Oh heavens, it is my Besse; Oh, sudden rapture! Let me retire to more considerate thoughts. What should I think, but presently to wake her? And being mine, to seize her where I finde her. Oh, but mine oath, that I should never, never Lie with her being my wife, nor kisse her, touch her, Speak to her one familiar syllable. Can oaths binde thus? My honesty, faith, and Religion are all ingag'd, ther's no dispence for them. And yet in all this conflict to remember How the Duke prais'd her vertu, chastitie, And constancie, whom nothing could corrupt, Ads to my joyes. But on the neck of this, It laies a double torture on my life. First to forsweare, then leave so fair a wife. She starts. Besse. I am all distraction. In my sleep I saw him, could I but behold him waking. That were a heaven. Ha, do I dream still? Or was I born to see Nothing but strange illusions. Spencer: Love. Spencer. I am neither. Besse. Thou hast his shape, his gate, his face, his language: Onely these words of thine and strange behaviour, Never came from him. Let me imbrace thee. Spenc. No. Besse. Then kisse me. Spenc. No. Besse. Yet speak me fair. Spenc. I cannot. Bess. Look on me. Spenc. I must not, I will not, fare thee well: Yet first read that. Besse. I have read too much already within thy change of looks. Spenc. Oh me my oath; Ide chop off this right hand to cancell it. Besse. But if not now, when then? Spenc. Never. Besse. Not kisse me? Spenc. No. Besse. Not fold mee in thine arms? Spenc. Not. Besse. Nor cast a gratious look upon thy Besse? Spenc. I dare not. Besse. Never. Spenc. No never. Besse. Oh, I shall die. She swounds. Spenc. She faints, and yet I dare not for my oath Once to support her. Dies before mine eies. And yet I must not call her back to life. Where is the Duke? some help, no Ladies nigh? Are you all, all asleep or dead, Ther's no more noise in Court? Enter Duke and his train. Flor. Ha, what's the buisinesse, noble friend, what newes How speed you with my Mistrisse? Spenc. You may see there on the ground, half In the grave already. So fare you well, What grief mine is, those that love best can tell. Flor. Support her. Speak love, look up divinest Mistrisse. Bess. You said you would not speak, nor look, nor touch your Besse. Flor. Who I? By all my hopes I ne're had such a thought. Besse. Oh, I mistook. Flor. Why do you look so gastly about the room? Whom do's your eyes enquire for? Besse. Nothing, nay, no body. Flor. Why do you weep? Besse. Hath some new love possest him, and excluded Me from his bosome? can it be possible? Flor. All leave the chamber. Besse. But Ile be so reveng'd as never woman was: Ile be a president to all wives hereafter, How to pay home their proud neglectfull husbands; 'Tis in my way, I've power, and Ile do it. Flor. What is't offends you? Besse. 'Tis you have don't. Flor. Wee? Besse. If you be the Prince: Ther's but one man I hate above all the world, And you have sent him to torment me here. Flor. What satisfaction shall I make thee for't? Besse. This, and this onely; If you have any interest In him, or power above him: if you be a Prince In your own countrey, have command and rule In your own dominions, freely resigne his person And his state solely to my disposure. Flor. But whence grows The ground of such inveterate hate? Bess. All circumstance to omit, He, and onely he ravish't me from my countrey, He was the cause of all my afflictions, Tempests, shipwrack, fears. I never had just cause Of care and grief but he was author of it. Speak, is he mine? Flor. What interest I can claim, either by oath Or promise, thou art Commandresse of. Besse. Then I am yours; And to morrow in the publike view of all The stranger Princes, Courtiers, and Ladies, I will expresse my self. This night I intreat I may repose my self in my own lodging For private meditations. Flor. What we have promist, Is in our purpose most irrevocable, And so we hope is yours. Besse. You may presume, my lord. Flor. Conduct this Lady to her chamber, Let her have all observance: we will lay Our strict command on him, lest he should leave Our City before our summons, 'tis to morrow, then, Shall happy thee, make us most blest of men. Exit Duke. Besse. Now shall I quite him home, Th'ingrate shall know, 'Tis above patience to be injur'd so. Merch. Will you walk Lady, or take your coach? Besse That we the streets more freely may survay, Wee'll walk along. Exeunt. Enter Clem with his pots. Clem. Let me see, three quarts, two pottles, one gallon and a pinte, one pinte, two quarts more, then I have my load: thus are we that are under-journeymen put too't. Oh the fortune of the seas; never did any man that marries a whore, so cast himself away, as I had been like i'th last tempest: yet nothing vexes me so much, that after all my travells, no man that meets me but may say, and say very truely, I am now no better then a pot companion. Enter Besse, Merchant. Besse. That should be Clem my man, give me some gold, Here, Sirra, drink this to the health Of thy old Mistris. Vsher on, We have more serious things to think upon. Clem. Mistris Besse, Mistris Elizabeth, 'tis shee: ha, gold: hence pewter pots, Ile be a pewter porter no longer: my Mistris turn'd Gallant, and shall I do nothing but run up stares and down stares with, Anon, anon, Sir? no, I have gold, and anon will be as gallant as the proudest of them. Shall I stand at the Bar to bar any mans casting that drinks hard? no, Ile send these pots home by some porter or other, put my self into a better habit, and say, The case is alter'd; then will I go home to the bush where I drew wine, and buy out my time, and take up my Chamber, be served in pomp by my fellow prentises: I will presently thither, Where I will flaunt it in my Cap and my Feather. Enter Goodlack, Spencer, Ruffman. Goodl. You tell us of the strangest wonderment that ever came within the compasse of my knowledge. Spenc. I tell you but what's true. Goodl. It cannot finde example. Did you leave her those extremities of passion? Spenc. I think dying, or the next way to death. Goodl. To chear you, The Dukes own witnesse of her constancy, And vertue, arm'd against all temptations, Part of your griefs should lessen. Spenc. Rather friend, Augment my passions, to be forc'd to lose, And quite abjure so sweet a bedfellow. Oh, it breeds more distraction. Goodl. VVer't my cause, I'de to the Duke and claim her, beg for justice, And through the populous court clamor my wrongs, If he detein her from you. Spenc. But my oath Ties me from that, I have quite abjur'd her, I have renounc'd her freely, cast her off, Disclaim'd her quite: I can no more Interest claim in her, then Goodlack Thou, or Ruffman thou. Goodl. 'Tis most strange, let's examine all our brains How this may be avoided. Ruff. How now Clem, you loyter here, the house is full of guests, and you are extreamly call'd for. Clem. You are deceived my Lieutenant, Ile assure you, you speak to as good a man as my self: Do you want any money? Goodl. Canst thou lend me any? Clem. Look, I am the lord of these mines, of these Indies. Ruff. How camest thou by them? Clem. A delicate sweet Lady, meeting me i'th street, like an Asse groaning under my heavy burthen, and being inamour'd of my good parts, gave me this gold: if you think I lie, examine all these pots, whose mouthes, if they could speak, would say as much in my behalf. But if you want any money, speak in time, for if I once turn Courtier again, I will scorn my poor friends, look scurvily upon my acquaintance, borrow of all men, be beholding to any man, and acknowledge no man: and my Motto shall be, Base is the man that paies. Ruff. But Clem, how camest thou by this gold? Clem. News, news, though not the lost sheep, yet the lost shrew is found, my Mistris, Mistris Elizabeth, 'tis she, she meeting me 'ith street, seeing I had a pot or two too much, gave me ten pounds in a purse to pay for it, Ecce signum. Enter a Lord. Lord. The Duke hath summond your appearance, Gentlemen, And laies his power of love, not of command, To visit him in Court. Clem. I am put into the number too, if he be a tall man, tell him we will attend his highnesse. Lord. Fellow, my language was not aim'd at you. Clem. But Sir, Ile make bold to come at first bidding. Lord. Sir, your reward staies for you at Court, For bringing of the out-law'd Captains head, Ther's order tane for't from the treasurie. Ruff. The Duke is just and royall. VVee'll attend you. Clem. And Ile go furnish my self with some better accoutriments, and Ile be with you to bring presently. Enter Florence, Mantua, and Farara. Mant. There is not in your looks renowned Florence, That sommers calme, and sweet alacritie That was wont there to shine, a winters storm Sits threatning on your discontented brow. May we desire the cause. Flor. VVhich you shall know. Princes, the fierce and bloody moors, have late Committed outrage on our seas, especially, One mightie Bashaw, 'gainst whom w'have sent Petro Deventuro, one of our best Sea Captains, And, till we hear of his successe, w'are bard Of much content. Enter Merchant. Merc. My lord, good news, Petro Deventuro is return'd With happy victory, and many noble prisoners, And humbly laies his conquest at your feet. Enter Petro, Bashaw. Flor. Petro, welcome. This thy service shall not die unrewarded. Freely relate The manner of thy Sea fight. Petro. Then thus, great Duke. This noble Bashaw: noble I must call him, For he deserves that worthy attribute, Did lord o're these our seas, appointed well; Laden with many a rich and golden spoil, Not weak to us in number; being in ken, We had him and his Gallies straight in chase: He ne're set sail or fled: afar our ordnance plaid; Comming more near, our muskets and our small shot, Like showers of hail begun the slaughter; There this Bashaw then perceiving straight That he must either yeeld or die: his Semiter He pointed to his breast, thinking thereon To perish, had not my coming staid him. Ioffer. Nor think, bold Christian, That I can commend, or thank thee for't, For who that's noble will not prize brave death Before a slavish bondage: had I died By mine own hand, 'thad been a soldiers pride. Flor. Although a prisoner captive and a Moor, Yet use him like the noblest of his nation. And now withdraw with him, till wee Determine of his ransome. Exit. Enter Merchant and Besse: also Spencer, Ruffman, Goodlack. Merch. Way there for the Dukes Mistrisse. Spenc. Ha, the Dukes Mistris, said he: Goodl. It was harsh. Besse. Keep off, we would have no such rubs as these, Trouble our way? but have them swept aside, A company of base companions, to do no reverence To a Princes Mistris. Spenc. Heare you that? Merch. Give back, you trouble the presence. Goodl. This cannot be Besse, but some Furie hath stoln her shape. Ruff. It seems strange. Spenc. But unto me most horrid. Besse. Great Duk, I come to keep my promise with you, if you keep your word with me. Flor. These kinde regreets are unto me more welcome Then my late victory got at Sea: Will't please you take your seat? Merc. Is not yon Spencer, and that the Captain of the Negro? Spenc. What shall we next behold? Flor. Yet are you mine? Besse. From all the world, great Florence, witnesse this, You ne're had yet a voluntary kisse. Spenc. 'Sfoot I could tear my hair off. Flor. Second your kindnesse, let these Princes see Your tempting lips solely belongs to me. Besse. Ther's one again, it surfets me 'bove measure, To be a Princes darling, and choice treasure. Spencer. Hold me Goodlack, or I shall break out, Into some dangerous outrage. Goodl. Shew in this your wisdome, and quite suppresse your fury. Flor. Princes, I fear you have mistook your selves In these two strangers, for I have little hope To finde them worthy your great character. Mant. There must be great presumption that must force belief to that. Farar. Nay more then presumptions, proofs, Or they will win small credit. Flor. You had from us Lady, a costly jewell, It cost ten thousand crowns, speak, can you shew it? Besse. I kept it chary As mine own heart, because it came from you; But hurrying through the street, some cheating fellow, Snatcht it from my arm, therefore my suit is With whomsoe're the jewell may be found, The slave may die. Flor. His sentence thine, we never will revoke it. Our Merchant, search all our Courtiers and such Strangers as are within our Court. Merch. Her's one of no mean lustre that this Gentleman wears in his hat. Flor. Reach it the Lady. Goodl. This cannot be Besse Bridges, but some Medusa, Chang'd into her lively portrature. Besse. Princes, the thief is found: what e're he be That's guilty of this felony, I beg That I may be his sentencer. Flor. Thou shalt. Besse. If you have any intrest in his blood, His oaths or vows, freely resigne them, him, And all at my dispose. Flor. Have we not don't? Farar. Who can with the least honour speak for him, The theft being so apparant? Clem. Now if she should challenge me with the purse she gave me, and hang me up for my labour, I should curse the time that ever I was a courtier. Besse. Let me descend, and e're I judge the Fellon, Survay him first. 'Tis pitty, for it seems He hath an honest face. The word was never. Goodl. What Besse, forget your self? Besse. An indifferent proper man, and take these courses. You said you would not speak, nor look upon, nor touch your Besse. Spenc. I could be a new Sinon and betray A second Troy, rather then suffer this. Besse Good outward parts, but in a forraign clime Shame your own countrey. Never think of that. Spencer I fear my heart will break, It doth so struggle for eruption forth. Flor. When do you speak his sentence, Lady? Bess. You'l confirm't what e're it be. Flor. As we are Prince we will. Besse. Set forth the prisoner. Merch. Stand forward Englishman. Besse Then hear thy doom, I give thee back thy life, And in thy arms throw a most constant wife; If Thou hast rashly sworn, thy oaths are free, Th'art mine by gift, I give my self to thee. Flor. Lady, we understand not this. Bess. Shall I make it plain? This is, great Duke, my husband, Whose vertues even the barbarous Moors admir'd. This the man for whom a thousand dangers I've endur'd, Of whom the best approved Croniclers, Might write a golden legend. Merch. My lord, I know that Gentleman For Spencer, and her husband, for mine eyes Saw them espous'd in Fesse: that Gentleman, As I take it, was Captain of the Negro, Th'other his Lieutenant. Clem. And do not you know me? Merch. Not I, Sir. Clem. I am Bashaw of Barbarie, by the same token I sould certain precious stones to purchase the place. Flo. Lady, you told us he was the author Of all your troubles, cares, and fears. Besse. I told true, his love was cause of all, It drew me from my Countrey in his quest, When I despair'd: and finding him in Fesse, Oh do but think great Duke if e're you lov'd, What might have bought him from you. Had my Spencer been an Euridice, I would have plaid the Orpheus, And found him out in hell. Flor. We now perceive, The cause of all these errours his unkindnesse, Grounded on his rash oath, which we release; And all those vertues, honours, and renowns, Which e'ne the barbarous Moors seem'd to admire, Wee'll dignifie and raise their suffrage higher, All. Florence is honourable. Enter Ioffer, Venturo. Flor. Bring in the Bashaw, call Venturo forth. Ioffer Duke, I am prisoner, Put me to ransome or to death: But to death rather; For me thinks, a Souldier should not outlive bondage. Spenc. Bashaw Ioffer? Leave my embraces, Besse, for I of force am cast Into his arms. My noble friend? Ioff. I know you not, and I could wish you did not know me, now I am a prisoner, a wretch, a captive, and such a one as I would not have my friends to know. I pray stand off. Spenc. Because you are in durance, Should I not know you? no: For then the noblest mindes should friends best know. Have you forgot me, Sir? Ioff. No; were I in freedome and my princely honours, I should then be proud to call you Spencer, And my friend, but now Spenc. An English vertue thou shalt try, That for my life once didst not fear to die. That for his noble office done to me, Embrace him Besse, dear Goodlack, and the rest, Whilst to this Prince I kneel. This was the Bashaw, King Mullisheg made him great Viceroy of Argiers. I know not, Prince, how he is faln so low, But if my self, my friends, and all my fortunes May redeem him home, unto my naked skin Ile sell my self: and if my wealth Will not amount so much, Ile leave my self in hostage. Farar. 'Tis the part Of a most noble friend. Mant. And in these times worthy admiration Flor. I wonder not the Moors so grac'd this nation, If all the English equall their vertues. For this brave Stranger so indear'd to thee, Passe to thy countrey ransomlesse and free. All Royall in all things is the duke of Florence. Ioff. Such honour is not found in Barbarie. The vertue in these Christians hath converted me, Which to the world I can no longer smother, Accept me then a Christian and a brother. Flor. Princes, These unexpected novelties, Shall ad unto the high solemnity Of your best welcome. Worthy Englishman, And you, the mirrour of your sex and nation, Fair English Elizabeth, as well for vertue As admired beautie, wee'll give you cause, ere You depart our Court, to say great Fesse Was either poor, or else not bountifull. Bashaw, wee'll honour your conversion, With all due rites. But for you beauteous Lady, Thus much in your behalf we do proclaim, The fairest Maid were pattern'd in her life, So fair a Virgin, and so chast a wife.</field>
