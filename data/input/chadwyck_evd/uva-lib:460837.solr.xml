      <field name="fulltext">MYRRHA. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNET. TO THE NOBLE LADY THE COUNTESS LOUISA STOLBERG OF ALBANY. Sometimes regretting that thy gentle name Is yet suppress'd by me, in front of these To thee too-oft repeated tragedies, Whence I of folly p'rhaps shall reap the blame; Now would I grace with thee the one whose frame The least displeases thee; though all my ease, Though all the pleasure which gave power to please, From thee, sole source of inspiration, came. The at once innocent and horrid love Of the unhappy maid from Cinyras sprung, Always caused tears from thy bright eyes to flow; These tears imperiously my bosom move To consecrate to thee, (who heard'st it sung With sympathetic feeling,) Myrrha's woe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Cinyras. Cecris. Myrrha. Pereus. Euryclea. Chorus. Priests. People.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Palace in Cyprus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Cecris, Euryclea. Ce. Come, faithful Euryclea: now the dawn Scarce glimmers; and to me so soon as this My royal consort is not wont to come. Now thou canst tell me all that thou dost know Of our afflicted daughter: even now Thy troubled countenance and half-stifled sighs Announce to me ... Eu. Oh queen! ... Unhappy Myrrha Drags on a life far worse than any death. I dare not to the monarch represent Her horrible state: the troubles of a maid Ill could a father understand; thou canst, A mother. Hence to thee I come; and pray That thou wilt hear me. Ce. It is true, that I For a long time have seen the lustre languish Of her rare beauty: obstinate and mute, A mortal melancholy dims in her That fascinating look: and, could she weep! ... But before me she's silent; evermore Her eyes are, with tears never shed, suffused. In vain do I embrace her; and in vain Request, entreat her, to divulge her grief; Her grief she contradicts; while day by day I see her by that grief consumed. Eu. A daughter To you she is by blood, to me by love; Thou that I brought her up know'st well: and I Exist in her alone; and almost half Of the fourth lustre is already spent Since every day I've clasp'd her to my breast In my fond arms ... And now, can it be true, That towards me, to whom she was accustom'd From earliest childhood to speak all her thoughts, E'en towards me she now appears reserved? And if I speak to her of her distress, To me too she denies it, and insists, And seems displeased with me ... But yet she oft, Spite of herself, bursts into tears before me. Ce. Such vehement sadness, in so young a heart, At first I deem'd to be the consequence Of the irresolution which she felt In the oft-urged selection of a consort. The most illustrious, powerful potentates Of Greece and Asia, all in rivalry From the wide-spreading rumour of her beauty, To Cyprus flock'd: and, as respected us, She was the perfect mistress of her choice. These various impulses, unknown, discordant, Might in a youthful bosom well excite No slight disturbance. She his valour praised In one; his courteous manners in another; This was endow'd with ampler territories; In that were majesty and comeliness Blended consummately; and he who caught Her eyes the most, she fear'd the least perchance Might gratify her father. Thoroughly I, as a mother and a woman, know What conflicts, in the young unpractised heart Of a timid virgin, might be well excited By such incertitude. But when by Pereus, Heir of Epirus, every doubt seem'd banish'd; To whom for power, nobility, and youth, Valour, and comeliness, and sense, no one Could be compared; then, when the lofty choice Of Myrrha gain'd the sanction of her parents; When she, on this account, ought to exult With self-congratulation, we behold The storm more furiously arise in her, And more insufferable agonies Consume her every day ... At such a sight I feel my heart as if asunder torn. Eu. Ah, had she never made that fatal choice! From that day forth her anguish has increased: This very night, the last one that precedes Her lofty nuptial rites, (oh heaven!) I fear'd That it had been to her the last of life!â Motionless, silent, I lay in my bed, From her's not far remote; and, still intent On all her movements, made pretence to sleep: But months and months have past, that I have seen her In such extremity, that all repose Flies from my aged limbs. I for my daughter Th' assistance of benignant sleep invoked Most silently within myself; o'er her For many, many nights he has not spread His downy wings. Her sobs and sighs at first Were almost smother'd; they were few, were broken; Then (hearing me no longer) they increased To such ungovernable agony, That, at the last, against her will, they changed To passionate tears, to sobs, to piercing screams. Amid her agitation, from her lips One word alone escaped, âDeath! ... death!â and oft, In broken accents, she repeated it. I started from my couch; precipitous I ran to her; and scarce had she beheld me, Ere, in the midst, she suddenly repress'd Each tear, each sigh, each word, and, recomposed In royal stateliness, as if almost Incensed with me, in a firm voice she cried, âWhy comest thou to me? What would'st thou? Hence!â ... I could not answer her; I wept, embraced her, Then wept again ... At length my speech return'd. Oh how did I implore her, how conjure her To tell me her affliction, that, at last, Thus in her bosom pent, would, with her life, My life destroy ... Thou surely, though a mother, Could'st not have spoken to her with more fond, And more persuasive love.âShe knows it well How much I love her; and, at my discourse, Once more the torrents from her eyes gush'd forth, And she embraced me, and with tenderness To my fond importunities replied. But still, inflexibly reserved, she said, That every virgin, when the nuptial day Approaches, is oppress'd with transient grief; And she commanded me not to divulge Her anguish to her parents. But, alas! So deeply rooted is her malady, So fearful are its inward ravages, That I run tremblingly to thee; and beg That, by thy means, these rites may be delay'd: To death the virgin goes, be sure of this.â Thou art a mother; ... I say nothing more. Ce. ... Ah! ... choak'd by weeping, ... scarcely ... can I speak.â Whence can this malady arise, ah whence? ... What other suffering, at her youthful age, Is there, except the suffering of love? But if by Pereus she is inflamed, By her spontaneously chosen, whence, When on the point of gaining him, this grief? And if another flame feed on her heart, Why hath she chosen Pereus herself Among so many others? Eu. ... Her fierce grief Doth not, I swear to thee, arise from love. She always was observed by me; nor could she, Without my seeing it, resign her heart To any passion: and she would, be sure, Have told it me, her mother as to years, But, in her love, a sister. Her deportment, Her countenance, her sighs, her very silence, Ah! all convince me that she loves not Pereus. She, if not joyous, was, before she chose, Tranquil at least; and thou know'st well how she Delay'd to chuse. But yet, assuredly No other man pleased her ere she saw Pereus: 'Tis true, she seem'd to give to him the preference, Because it was, or so at least she deem'd it, Her duty to chuse one. She loves him not; To me it seems so: yet what other suitor, Compared with noble Pereus, can she love? I know her to possess a lofty heart; A heart in which a flame that were not lofty Could never enter. This can I safely swear: The man that she could love ... of royal blood That man must be, or he were not her lover. Now, who of these have ye admitted here, Whom at her will she could not with her hand Make happy? Then her grief is not from love. Love, though it feed itself with tears and sighs, Yet still it leaves I know not what of hope, That vivifies the centre of the heart; But in her deep impenetrable gloom There glimmers no coy radiance: in her wound, Festering and irremediable, there lurks No sanative balsamic antidote! ... Ah, could the death that she invokes for ever Be granted first to me! I should at least Not see her thus by a slow fire consumed! ... Ce. Thou dost distract me! ... To these marriage rites Never will I consent, if they are destin'd To take from us our only daughter ... Go; Return to her; and do not say to her That thou hast spoken with me. I myself, Soon as the tears are from my eyes dispersed, And my face recomposed, will thither come. Eu. Ah, quickly come. I will return to her; I am impatient once more to behold her. Oh heaven! who knows if she has not once more Been with these frantic paroxysms seized, While I have thus at length with thee conversed? Alas! what pity do I feel for thee, Unhappy mother! ... I fly hence; but thou, Ah, linger not! ... The less thou dost delay, The more good wilt thou do ... Ce. How much delay Costs me, thou may'st conceive: but I will not Call her at such an unaccustom'd hour, Nor go to her, much less present myself With visage incomposed. It is not fit To impress her either with distress or fear: So modest, timid, pliable is she, That no means with that noble temper can Be too indulgent. Quickly, go; repose In me, as I in thee alone repose. SCENE THE SECOND. Cecris. Ce. From whence can this originate? Already The year is almost spent, which I've consumed With Euryclea in surmises vain; And yet no trace whence Myrrha's sorrow springs Can I discern!âPerhaps the gods themselves, Envious of our prosperity, would snatch From us so rare a daughter, the sole comfort, Sole hope of both her parents. Oh ye gods, 'Twere better never to have given her to us! Oh Venus! thou sublime divinity Of this devoted isle, sacred to thee, Perchance her too great beauty moves thy envy! And hence perchance thou, equally with her, Reducest me to this distracted state. Ah! yes, thou wilt that I should thus atone In tears of blood, for my inordinate, Presumptuous transports of a partial mother. SCENE THE THIRD. Cinyras, Cecris. Cin. Weep not, oh lady. I have briefly heard The painful narrative; to this disclosure I prompted Euryclea. Ah! believe me, Sooner a thousand times would I expire, Than with our idolized and only daughter Adopt coercive means. Who could have thought That by this marriage, which was once her choice, She could be brought to such extremity? But let it be dissolved. My life, my realm, And even my glory vanishes to nothing, If I see not our only daughter happy. Ce. Yet Myrrha ne'er was versatile. We saw her In understanding far surpass her years; Discreet in every wish; constant and eager Our smallest wishes to anticipate. She knows full well, that in her noble choice We deem'd ourselves most fortunate: she cannot, No, never, hence repent of it. Cin. But yet If she in heart repent of it!âOh, lady, Hear her: all the soft pleadings of a mother Do thou adopt with her; do thou at length Compel her to unfold her heart to thee, Since there is time for this. Myself meanwhile Will unfold mine to thee; and I assure thee, Nay, e'en I swear, that of my heart's first thoughts My daughter is the object. It is true, I pleased myself in thinking I should form Alliance with the monarch of Epirus: And the young Pereus, his noble son, Adds, to the future hope of a rich kingdom, Other advantages, in my esteem More precious far. A character humane, A heart no less compassionate than lofty, Doth he evince. Besides, he seems to me By Myrrha's beauties fervently inflamed.â I never could select a worthier consort To ensure my daughter happiness; no doubts Of these pledged marriage rites torment his heart; His father's indignation and his own, If we renounced our covenanted faith, Would be most just; and their rage might to us Be not informidable: thus behold Many and potent reasons in the eyes Of almost every prince, but none in mine; Nature made me a father; chance a king. Those which are deem'd by others of my rank, Reasons of state, to which they are accustom'd To make all natural affections yield, In my paternal bosom would not weigh Against a solitary sigh of Myrrha's. I, by her happiness alone, can be Myself made happy. Go; say this to her; Assure her also that she need not fear Displeasing me in telling me the truth: Nought let her fear, except to make ourselves, Through her own means, unhappy. I meanwhile, By questions artfully proposed, will learn From Pereus if he deem his love return'd; And thus will I prepare him for the issue, No less afflictive to himself than me. But yet the time is brief for doing this, If fate decree that we retract our purpose. Ce. Thou speakest well: I fly to her.âIt brings Great solace to me, in our grief, to see That one accordant will, one love, is ours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Cinyras, Pereus. Pe. Behold me here, obedient to thy wishes. I hope, oh king, the hour is not far distant When with th' endearing epithet of father I may accost thee ... Cin. Listen to me, Pereus.â If thou well know thyself, thou canst not fail To be convinced how much a partial father Must be transported with exceeding joy In th' expectation that his only daughter Would find in thee a consort. Without doubt, Had I myself been destined to select A spouse for Myrrha, I had chosen thee Among the many and illustrious rivals That, with thyself, contended for her hand. Thence thou thyself may'st judge how doubly dear Thou wert to me when by herself elected. Thou, in the judgment of impartial men, In all pretensions wert unparagon'd; But, in my judgment, more than for thy blood, And thy hereditary realm, wert thou Unparagon'd for other qualities Intrinsically thine, whence thou must be, Although a private man, eternally Greater than any king ... Pe. Ah father! ... (I E'en now exult to call thee by this name) Father, my greatest, nay, my only value, Consists in pleasing thee. I have presumed To interrupt thee; pardon me; but I Cannot, or ere I merit them, receive From thee so many praises. To my heart Thy speech will be a high encouragement To make me that which thou believ'st me now, Or wishest me to be. Thy son-in-law, And Myrrha's consort, largely should I be With every lofty quality endow'd: And I accept from thee the augury Of virtue. Cin. Ah, thou speakest as thou art! And since thou art such, I shall dare to speak To thee as to a son.âI clearly see Thou lovest Myrrha with a genuine love; And I should wrong thee most unworthily Could I e'en doubt of this. But ... tell me, Pereus, ... If my request is not too indiscreet, Art thou as much beloved? Pe. ... I ought to hide Nothing from thee.âAh, Myrrha would, methinks, Love me again, and yet it seems she cannot. I cherish'd once a hope of her regard, And yet I hope t'obtain it; or, at least, My flattering wishes still prolong the dream. 'Tis true, that, most inexplicably, she Persists in her reserve. Thou, Cinyras, Although thou be a father, still retainest Thy youthful vigour, and rememberest love. Know then, that evermore with trembling steps, And as if by compulsion, she accosts me; A deathly paleness o'er her countenance steals; And her fine eyes towards me are never turn'd. A few irresolute and broken words She faulters out, involved in mortal coldness; Her eyes, eternally suffused with tears, She fixes on the ground; in speechless grief Her soul is buried; a pale sickliness Dims, not annihilates, her wond'rous charms:â Behold her state. Yet of connubial rites She speaks; and now thou would'st pronounce, that she Desired those rites; now, that, far worse than death, She dreaded them; now she herself assigns The day for these, and now she puts it off. If I enquire the reason of her grief, Her lip denies it; but her countenance ... Of agony expressive, and of death, Proclaims incurable despair.â Me she assures, and each returning day Renews the assurance, that I am her choice; She says not that she loves me; high of heart, She knows not how to feign. I wish and fear To hear from her the truth: I check my tears; I burn, I languish, and I dare not speak. Now from her faith, reluctantly bestow'd, Would I myself release her; now again I fain would die, since to resign her quite I have no power; yet, unpossess'd her heart, Her person would I not possess ... Alas! ... I scarcely know whether I live or die.â Thus, both oppress'd, and though, with different griefs, Both with affliction equally weigh'd down, We to the fatal day at last are come, Th' irrevocable day which she herself Hath chosen for our marriage ... Ah, were I The only victim of so much distress! Cin. As much as she, dost thou excite my pity ... Thy frank and fervid eloquence bespeaks A soul humane and lofty: such a soul Did I ascribe to thee: hence to thyself I will not less ingenuously speak.â I tremble for my child. I share with thee A lover's grief; ah, prince! do thou too share A father's grief with me. Ah, if she were Unhappy by my means! ... 'Tis true, that none Constrain'd her ... But yet, if timidity, Or virgin bashfulness ... If finally Myrrha should now capriciously repent! ... Pe. No more; I understand thee. To a lover, Who loves as I do, canst thou represent The beloved object wretched for his sake? Could I, though innocently, deem myself The origin of all her wretchedness, And not expire with grief?âAh, Myrrha, now Pronounce on me, and on my destiny, A final sentence; fearlessly pronounce it, If Pereus' love be irksome; yet for this Never shall I regret that I have loved thee. Oh, could I make her joyful with my tears! ... To me 'twould be a blessing e'en to die, So that she might be happy. Cin. Pereus, who Can hear thee without weeping? ... No, a heart More faithful, more impassion'd than thine own, There cannot be. Ah! as thou hast to me, Could'st thou disclose it also to my daughter: She could not hear thee, and refuse t'unfold To thee with equal confidence her own. I do not think that she repents her choice; (Who, knowing thee, could do this?) but perchance Thou may'st solicit from her heart the source Of her conceal'd distress.âBehold, she comes; I had already summon'd her. With her I leave thee. To the interview of lovers Fathers are ever a restraint. Now, prince, Fully reveal to her thy lofty heart, A heart by which all others must be sway'd. SCENE THE SECOND. Myrrha, Pereus. My. With Pereus he leaves me ... Fatal trial! This rends my heart indeed. Pe. At length, oh Myrrha, The day is come, that which, if thou wert so, Is destined to make me supremely happy. Thy hair with nuptial coronals adorn'd, Thy form enveloped in a pompous robe, I see indeed: but on thy countenance, Thy looks, thy gestures, and in every step, Pale melancholy lours. Oh Myrrha, he Who loves thee far more than his proper life, Cannot behold thee with a mien like this To an indissoluble tie approach. This is the hour, th' important hour is this, When 'tis no more allowable for thee To pass delusions on thyself or others. Thou should'st divulge to me (whate'er it be) The cause of thy distress; or should'st at least Confess to me that thou dost not repose Thy confidence in me; that I bewray Thy injudicious choice, and that at heart Thou art repentant, and would'st fain retract. I shall not hence account that I am wrong'd; Oh no! though this sad heart will be surcharged With mortal wretchedness. But what car'st thou For the distraction of a man not loved, And slenderly esteem'd? It too much now Imports to me not to make thee unhappy. Then speak to me explicitly and boldly. But thou art mute and motionless? ... Thy silence Breathes disaffection, ... death. Thy silence is An answer too decisive: ... thou dost hate me; And dar'st not say it ... Now resume thy faith: I instantly prepare myself to fly For ever from thine eyes, since I am thus An object of aversion ... But if I Was always so, how deserved I thy choice? If I became so afterwards, ah, tell me In what I have offended thee? My. ... Oh prince! ... Thy overweening love depicts my grief More poignant than it is. Beyond the bounds Of truth thy heated phantasy impels thee. With silence thy unprecedented words I hear; what wonder? unexpected things, Unacceptable, and e'en more than this, Not true, dost thou express: how can I then Reply to thee?âThis, for our nuptial rites, Is the appointed day; I hither come To accomplish them: and doth he meanwhile doubt, The consort chosen by myself, of me? 'Tis true, perchance my spirits are not buoyant, As her's should be who doth obtain a spouse Distinguish'd like thyself: but pensiveness In some is nature's cast; and ill could he Whose spirits stagnate in a constant ebb, Trace the dim cause that interdicts their flow: And often an officious questioning, Instead of making manifest the cause, Redoubles the effect. Pe. I'm irksome to thee; I see it by unquestionable symptoms. Alas! I knew that thou could'st never love me; Yet in my infirm heart I had caress'd At least the flattering hope thou didst not hate me: In time, for thine and my peace, I perceive That I deceived myself!â'Tis not (alas!) Within my power to make thee hate me not: But on myself doth it alone depend To make thee not despise me. Now art thou Freed, and released from all thy promised faith. Against thy will illicitly I gain'd it:â Not by thy parents, ... and still less by me, ... By a false shame thou art restrain'd. Thou would'st, Not to incur the blame of versatile, Thine own worst enemy, render thyself The victim of thy error: and dost thou Hope I should suffer this? Ah no!âThat I Love thee, that I deserve thee, now I ought To prove this to thee by refusing thee ... My. Thou dost delight to exasperate my grief ... Ah! how can I be joyous in thy presence, If I am destined always to behold Thy love ill-pleased with mine? Can I assign The causes of a grief, for the most part In me supposititious, which, indeed, If true in part, perhaps has no other cause Than the new state which I'm about to enter, And the obligation to divide myself From my beloved parents; and the words So oft repeated to myself, âPerhaps âI never more shall see them ... never more?â The long, long pilgrimage to other realms; The change of manners and the change of place; The long farewell to all familiar objects, And all familiar friends, from childhood loved; And other thoughts, by thousands and by thousands, All passionate and tender, and all sad, And all indisputably better known, And felt more keenly, than by any other, By thy humane, courteous, and lofty heart.â I gave myself spontaneously to thee; Nor have I ever with repentant thoughts, I swear to thee, look'd back on this resolve. If it were so, I would have told it to thee: Thee, above all men, I esteem; from thee Nothing would I conceal, ... that I would not Likewise, from my own consciousness, conceal.â Now I implore, let him who loves me best, Speak to me least of this my wretchedness, And 'twill in time, I feel assured, depart. Could I, not prizing thee, give thee my hand, I should despise myself: and how not prize thee? My lip knows not to speak that which my heart Doth not first dictate: yet that lip assures thee, Swears to thee, that I never will belong To any one but thee.âWhat more can I Profess to thee? Pe. ... Myrrha, I venture not To ask of thee one thing, which, could'st thou say it, Would give me life indeed! Fatal demand! 'Twere death, I fear, to be resolved on this ... Thou to be mine then dost not now disdain? Dost not repent of it, and no delay? My. No, none; this is the day; I will be thine.â But let our sails be hoisted to the winds To-morrow, and for ever let us leave These shores behind us. Pe. Do I hear thee rightly? With such abrupt transition how canst thou Thus differ from thyself? It tortures thee So much to abandon thy beloved parents, Thy native country, yet would'st thou depart Speedily thus for ever ... My. I, ... for ever ... Would ... thus abandon them; ... and die of ... grief ... Pe. What do I hear? Thy anguish hath betray'd thee; ... Thy words and looks are prompted by despair. I swear that I will never be the means Of thy destruction; never ... of my own Too certainly ... My. ... 'Tis true ... 'tis too, too true; ... I am distracted by a mighty woe ... But no, believe me not.âInflexibly I to my purpose keepâWhile I have thus My bosom harden'd as it were with grief, My parting hence will be less keenly felt: A solace in thyself ... Pe. ... No, Myrrha, no: ... I am the cause, I am, (though innocent) Of the dire conflict, which thus lacerates, And agitates thy heart.âI will not now Longer prevent with my importunate presence Needful alleviation of thy grief.â Do thou thyself, oh Myrrha, to thy parents Propose some means that may deliver thee From ties so inauspicious; or from them Thou'lt hear to-day of Pereus' violent death. SCENE THE THIRD. Myrrha. My. Ah, go not to my parents! ... Hear me, ... hear me! ... He flies from me ... Oh heaven! what have I said? Let me to Euryclea quickly run: No, not one instant would I with myself Remain alone ... SCENE THE FOURTH. Myrrha, Euryclea. Eu. Oh whither dost thou fly Thus with such breathless haste, beloved daughter? My. Where can I find, if not in thee, some solace? To thee I came ... Eu. I, from a distance, long Have watch'd thee carefully. Thou knowest well I never can abandon thee: I hope That thou wilt pardon me. From thence I saw Pereus rush troubled forth; and I find thee With heavier grief oppress'd: ah, dearest daughter, Thy tears at least may freely have a vent Within my breast. My. Ah yes, dear Euryclea, With thee I may at least shed tears ... I feel As if my heart would burst from checking them. Eu. And wilt thou, in a state like this, persist, Oh daughter, in these hymeneal rites? My. I hope my agonies may kill me first ... But no; that cannot be; the time's too short; ... They afterwards will kill me, kill me soon ... Death, ... death, ... I have no other wish ... but death ... No other destiny, save death ... deserve ... Eu. âMyrrha, no other furies can assail With such barbarity thy youthful breast, Save those of love ... My. What dar'st thou say to me? What cruel falsehood? ... Eu. Ah, do not, I beseech thee, Be grieved with me. For a long time I have thought so: But if it thus displease thee, I will dare No more to say it to thee. Ah, may'st thou Preserve with me the confidence of weeping! Neither do I know well if I believe What I have said; moreover, to thy mother I hitherto have strenuously denied it ... My. What do I hear? Oh heaven! does she perchance Also suspect it? ... Eu. And who, seeing thus A tender virgin in excessive grief, And grief apparently without a cause, Would not deem love the origin of this? Ah! were thy grief from love alone! at least Some remedy might then be found.âImmersed In this perplexing doubt for a long time, I to the altar dared one day to go Of Venus, our sublime divinity; With tears, with incense, and persuasive prayers, With labouring heart, before her sacred image Prostrate, I ventured to pronounce thy name ... My. Ah! what audacity! What hast thou done? Venus! ... Oh heaven! ... inimical to me ... The force of her implacable revenge ... What do I say? ... Alas! ... I shudder, ... tremble ... Eu. 'Tis true, I was audaciously officious: The angry deity disdain'd my vows; The incense, in a smouldering gloom involved, With difficulty burn'd; and, downwards driven, The smoke collected round my hoary head. Would'st thou hear further? I presumed to raise To the stern image my afflicted eyes, And horribly incensed with indignation, With threatening looks the goddess seem'd to me Herself to drive me from her sacred feet. With trembling steps I totter'd from the temple, Palsied with fear ... In telling this, I feel My hair with horror once more stand on end ... My. And thou with terror mak'st me also shudder. What hast thou dared to do? By Myrrha now Must no celestial power, and much less that Of our tremendous goddess, be invoked. I am abandon'd by the gods; my breast Opens its chambers to the ravening furies; There they alone authority possess, And residence.âAh! if there still remains In thee the shadow of a genuine pity, My faithful Euryclea, (thou alone Canst do it,) save me from despair: 'tis slow, Too slow, although 'tis infinite, my grief. Eu. Thou mak'st me tremble ... What can I? ... My. ... I ask thee To abridge my woes. By little and by little Thou seest my o'er-worn, o'er-task'd frame decay; My lingering agonies destroy my parents; A burden to myself, a curse to others, I never can escape: 'twere pity, love, To expedite my death; from thee I ask it ... Eu. Oh heaven! ... from me? ... My very utterance fails, ... My breath, ... my thought ... My. Ah no, thou lov'st me not! I weakly deem'd that in thy aged breast There dwelt a comprehensive tenderness ... Yet thou thyself didst in my tender years Exhort me to nobility of thought: Oft have I heard from thee that virtuous souls Should prefer death to infamy. Alas! ... What do I say? ... But thou dost hear me not ... Motionless, ... mute, ... thou scarcely breath'st! Oh heaven! ... What have I said? Distracted with my pangs ... I know not what I've said: Ah, pardon me; My second mother, be once more thyselfe ... Eu. ... Oh daughter, daughter! ... Thou ask death from me? Thou death from me? ... My. Esteem me not ungrateful; Nor that the anguish of my own despair Robs me of pity for the pangs of others.â Wilt thou not see me then extinct in Cyprus? Thou must perforce, ere it be long, be told, That ere the vessel reach Epirus' shore, Myrrha had breathed her last. Eu. In vain dost thou Presume to yield to these abhorred nuptials. I to thy parents fly to tell the whole ... My. Ah, do it not, or irretrievably Thou forfeitest my love: ah, do it not, I pray thee; in the name of thy true love I do conjure thee. From a troubled heart Accents escape which should not be recorded.â An ample solace (one which hitherto I've not allow'd) hath been my tears with thee, The speaking of my grief: in me already My courage hence is doubled.âA few hours Are wanting to my solemn nuptial rite. Be ever near me: let us go. Meanwhile It is thy province to confirm me more In my inevitable lofty purpose. Thou by thy faithful council, and thy more Than mother's love, at once should'st strengthen me; Thou should'st so act, that firmly I pursue The sole remaining honourable track.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Cinyras, Cecris. Ce. There is no doubt that Pereus, though he be Not yet return'd to us, by Myrrha's words Was wholly mortified. She loves him not; I am convinced of this; and 'tis too certain That perseverance in these purposed nuptials Will in the end conduct her to the tomb. Cin. For the last trial now, will we ourselves Hear from her lips the truth. I, in thy name, Have summon'd her to meet thee in this place. None of us, lastly, would compel her choice: She knows how much we love her; we, to whom Ourselves are not more dear. To me it seems Now utterly impossible, that she, In this respect, should close to us her heart; To us, who have made her the arbitress Not only of herself, but of ourselves. Ce. Behold, she comes! ... and oh! she seems to me Somewhat more joyful, and her step more firm ... Ah! could she be again what once she was! At the sole reappearance in her face E'en of a smile of joy, I quickly seem Restored once more to life. SCENE THE SECOND. Myrrha, Cinyras, Cecris. Ce. Beloved daughter, Ah, come to us! ah come! My. What do I see? Oh heaven! my father also! ... Cin. Haste, advance; Our only hope and life, advance securely; And apprehend not my paternal aspect More than thou fear'st thy mother's. We are both Ready to hear thee. Now, if thou art pleased The cause to tell us of thy cruel state, Thou giv'st us life; but if it rather please thee, Or spare thy apprehensive delicacy More, to conceal it, thou may'st also, daughter, Conceal it; for thy pleasure will be ours. To eternize the matrimonial tie One hour alone is wanting: every one Deems it a thing decided: but, if yet Thy will is changed; if thy committed faith Be irksome to thy heart; if thy free choice, Though once spontaneous, be no longer such; Be bold; fear nothing in the world; reveal All the misgivings of thy heart to us. Thou art by nothing bound; and we ourselves The first release thee; and thy generous lover, Worthy of thee, confirms this liberty. Nor will we tax thee with inconstancy: Rather will we admit, that thoughts mature, Though unforeseen, constrain thee to this change. By base regards thou never canst be moved; Thy noble character, thy lofty thoughts, Thy love for us, full well we know them all: A step of thee, and of thy blood unworthy, Thou never could'st e'en think it. Freely then Do thou fulfil thy wish. Provided thou Art once more happy, with that happiness Thou renderest thy parents happy also. Now, this thy present will whate'er it be, Do thou to us reveal it as to brothers. Ce. Ah yes, thou seest, Myrrha! Never didst thou Hear words of more persuasive tenderness, More mild, more tender, from thy mother's lips Than these. My. ... Is there a torment in the world That can compare with mine! ... Ce. But what is this? Sighing, thou mutterest to thyself? Cin. Ah let, Ah let thy heart speak to us: we will use No other language with theeâQuick, reply. My. ... My lord ... Cin. Ah Myrrha, 'tis a sad beginning: To thee I am a father, not a lord: Canst thou invoke me with another name, Oh daughter? My. Myrrha, this is the last conflict.â Be strong, my soul ... Ce. Oh heaven! ... The hues of death Upon her countenance ... My. On mine? ... Cin. But whence Tremblest thou thus? At me? ... My. ... I tremble not ... Methinksâor I, at least, no more shall tremble, Since ye now so compassionately hear me.â Your only, your too well beloved daughter, I well know that I am. I see you always, My joys enjoying, grieving in my griefs; E'en this my grief increases. Mine, alas! Passes the confines of a natural sorrow; In vain I hide it; and to you would speak it, ... If I knew it myself.âMy fatal sadness With growing years augmented every day, Long ere, amid the illustrious company Of noble lovers, Pereus I selected. Within my breast an angry deity, Unknown, inexorable, dwells; and hence, All power of mine is vain against his power ... Mother, believe me; though I be but young, My mind, e'en passing ordinary strength, Was, and is, strong: but my distemper'd frame, That yields o'er-burthen'd; ... and I feel myself With slow, though sure steps, tottering to the tomb ... All food, though scanty, and though only touch'd At distant intervals, to me is poison: Sleep everlastingly forsakes my pillow; Or dreams, with horrid images of death, My frame enervate more than sleepless nights. I do not find, throughout the day or night, A moment's peace, an instant of repose, A place that seems a resting place to me. Yet nothing in the shape of human comfort Do I presume to covet; death I deem, Expect, solicit as, my only cure. But, for my punishment, does Nature yet, With her tenacious and invisible bands, Protract my lingering life. I pity now, And now I hate, myself: I weep, and rave, And weep again. This, this is the incessant, Insufferable, fierce vicissitude, In which I drag along my heavy days.â But what? ... Do you too at my horrid state Shed tears? ... Beloved mother! ... let me then, ... To thy breast clinging, ... drinking in thy tears, ... Forego the sense of suffering for a moment! ... Ce. Beloved daughter, at a tale like this, Who could refrain from weeping? ... Cin. At her words I feel my bosom rent ... But finally, What ought we now to do? ... My. But finally, (Ah! trust to what I say) I ne'er conceived The wish to afflict you, or to extort from you Vain pity for myself, describing thus, Or trying to describe what mocks description, My fierce unutterable pangs.âWhen I, By chusing Pereus, had fix'd my fate, At first, 'tis true, I to myself appear'd Somewhat less troubled; but within my heart Proportionably fierce my grief return'd, As nearer and more near the day approach'd For forming the indissoluble tie. So much so, that three times indeed I dared To beg you to procrastinate the day. In these delays I somewhat calm'd myself; But, as the time diminish'd, all my pangs Resumed their wonted fierceness. To their height, To my consummate shame, consummate grief, Are they to-day arrived: but something tells me That they, to-day, are giving in my breast, The last proof of their strength. This day shall see me Consort to Pereus, or ... a breathless corse.â Ce. What do I hear? ... Oh daughter! ... Wilt thou thus In these lugubrious nuptials persevere? ... Cin. No, this shall never be. Thou lov'st not Pereus; And, spite of inclination, thou, in vain, Would'st give thyself to him. My. Ah, do not ye Take me from him; or quickly give me death ... 'Tis true, perhaps, I love him not as much As he loves me; ... and yet, of this I doubt ... Believe, that I sufficiently esteem him; And that no other man in all the world, If he have not, shall have my hand. I hope That Pereus, one day, as he ought to be, Will to my heart be dear; living with him In constant and inseparable faith, I hope that, by his means, peace will return, Joy will return to me; that life may be Still dear to me, and peradventrue happy. Ah! if I hitherto have loved him not As he deserves, 'tis not a fault of mine, But rather of my state; which makes me first Abhor myself ... Him have I chosen once: And now again I chuse him: wish for him, Solicit him, and him alone. My choice Beyond expression to yourselves was grateful: Be then, as ye will'd, and as now I will, The whole accomplish'd. Do ye try to rise Above your daughter's grief too, since that daughter Who suffers it, rises above that grief. I will, ere long, as much as in me lies, Come to these nuptials cheerfully; and ye, Perchance, will hold yourselves indebted to them For days of future peace. Ce. Oh matchless daughter! How many rare perfections thou unitest! Cin. Thy words a little calm me; but I tremble ... My. I feel, while thus in conference with you, My strength return. I may again perchance Wholly become the mistress of myself, If the gods will, provided ye will lend Me your assistance. Cin. What assistance? Ce. Speak! We will do every thing. My. I am constrain'd Once more to grieve you. Hear.âTo my worn breast, And to my troubled, weak, distemper'd mind, The sight of objects new to me will prove A potent remedy; and this will be Effectual in proportion as 'tis speedy. What it will cost me to abandon you, Oh heaven! I cannot say; my tears will tell it, When I give you the terrible farewell: If without falling lifeless ... in thy arms, I can, ... oh mother, ... do it ... But, if yet I can abandon you, the day will come, When, to this generous effort, I shall owe Life, peace, and happiness. Ce. Dost thou thus speak Of leaving us? Would'st do it instantly? At once dost fear and wish to do it? Whence Such inconsistency? ... Cin. T'abandon us? ... And what remains to us deprived of thee? Thou may'st at leisure afterwards depart To Pereus' father; but meanwhile ere this With us enjoy protracted happiness ... My. But if 'tis now impossible for me Here to be happy, would ye rather see me In Cyprus dead, than, from a foreign shore, Hear tidings of my full felicity?â Sooner, or later, to Epirus' realm My destiny invites me: there should I With Pereus finally abide. To you, When Pereus the paternal sceptre sways, One day will we return. Ye shall again In Cyprus see me, if the gods so grant, The joyful mother of a numerous offspring: And we will leave to you, of all our children The one which ye love best, to be the prop Of your declining years. Thus of your blood Shall ye possess an heir to this rich realm; Since offspring of the stronger sex, the gods Have hitherto denied to you. Then first, The day on which ye suffer'd me to go, Will ye commemorate with blessings.âAh, Grant that to-morrow Pereus and I Spread to the wind our sails. Within my heart I feel a certain and tremendous presage, That I, if ye prohibit my departure, Alas! within this inauspicious palace, Remain to-day th' inevitable victim Of an inscrutable and unknown power: That ye will lose me everlastingly ... Do you, I pray, compassionately yield To my fantastic presage; or be pleased, Indulging my distemper'd phantasy, To second what perchance ye deem an error. My life, my destiny, and also (Heavens! I shudder as I speak) your destiny, All, all, too much depend on my departure. Ce. Oh daughter! ... Cin. Ah! ... thy accents make me tremble ... But yet, if such thy will, so be it done. Whate'er may be my grief, I would prefer Never to see thee, than to see thee thus.â And thou, sweet consort, mute, and motionless, In tears? ... Consentest thou to her desire? Ce. Ah! could her absence kill me, as (alas!) I feel assured that I shall hence be doomed To languish in immitigable tears! ... Ah! might the augury one day prove true Which she suggested of her precious offspring; ... But yet, since such is her fantastic wish, So that she live, let it be gratified. My. Beloved mother, now thou givest me Life for the second time.âWithin an hour Shall I be ready for the nuptial rites.â Whether I love you, time will prove to you; Though now I seem impatient to forsake you.â Now, for a little while, do I retire To my apartments: fain would I appear With tearless eyes before the sacred altar; And worthy of acceptance, and approved, With brow serene my noble consort meet. SCENE THE THIRD. Cinyras, Cecris. Ce. Unhappy that we are! ... Unhappy daughter! ... Cin. Yet to behold her every day more sad, My heart hath not the firmness. 'Twere in vain To oppose ourselves ... Ce. Oh spouse! ... A thousand fears Invade my heart, lest her excess of grief, When she is gone from hence, should cause her death. Cin. From her expressions, from her looks, and gestures, And also from her sighs, it seems to me That by some superhuman agency She's fearfully possess'd. Ce. ... Ah! well I know, Implacable, vindictive Venus, well, Thy rigorous revenge. Thus dost thou make me Atone for my irreverent arrogance. But ah! my child was innocent; I only Was the delinquent; I alone the culprit ... Cin. Oh heaven! what hast thou dared against the goddess? ... Ce. Unhappy me! ... Oh Cinyras, hear my fault; When I beheld myself the spouse adored Of the most winning and attaching husband, A man for captivating grace unequall'd, And by him mother of an only daughter, (For beauty, modesty, and sense, and grace Throughout the world unrivall'd) I confess, Intoxicate with my distinguish'd lot, I dared deny to Venus, I alone, Her tributary incense.âWould'st thou more? Insensate, and extravagant, at last To such a pitch (alas infatuate!) Of madness I arrived, that from my lips I suffer'd the imprudent vaunt to escape, That by the illustrious, celebrated beauty Of Myrrha, now more votaries were drawn From Asia and from Greece, than heretofore Were e'er attracted to her sacred isle By warm devotion to the Cyprian queen. Cin. Oh! what is this thou sayest? ... Ce. From that day Henceforward, Myrrha lost her peace; her life, Her beauty, like frail wax before the fire, Slowly consumed; and nothing in our hands From that time seem'd to prosper. Afterwards What did I not attempt to appease the goddess? What prayers, what tears, what penitential rites Have I not lavish'd?âEvermore in vain!â Cin. Ill hast thou done, oh lady; and still worse Hath been thy guilt, in keeping it from me. A father wholly innocent, perchance, I might by means of mediatorial rites The pardon of the goddess impetrate: And yet perchance (I hope) I may succeed.â But meanwhile, now indeed do I concur In Myrrha's judgment, that of force we must, And with what promptitude we can effect it, Remove her from this desecrated isle. Who knows? Perchance the anger of the goddess Will not to other climes pursue her? Hence Our wretched daughter feeling in her breast Such an imperative and unknown presage, Perhaps hence alone, so much desires to go, And builds on this departure such warm hopes.â But Pereus comes; welcome he comes: he only, By taking her away from us, can now For us our daughter save. Ce. Oh destiny! SCENE THE FOURTH. Cinyras, Pereus, Cecris. Pe. Tardy, irresolute, and apprehensive, And full of mortal wretchedness, ye see me. A bitter conflict lacerates my heart: Me, pity, and disinterested love Of others, have subdued. This sacrifice Will cost my life. No otherwise this grieves me Than that I thus have forfeited the power To spend it in your service: but I will not, No, I will never drag t'untimely death My adored Myrrha! The disastrous tie Shall now be torn asunder; and with that The thread of my existence. Cin. ... Oh my son! ... Yet by this name I call thee; and I hope That thou ere long more than in name will be so. We, since thyself, have heard explicitly The secret thoughts of Myrrha: I have taken, As a true father, every means with her, To encourage her with absolute free will Her own unbiass'd judgment to pursue. But 'mid the winds the rock is not more firm, Than she is firm to thee: thee, thee, alone She wills, and she solicits; and she fears Lest thou be taken from her. She knows not Herself how to adduce to us a cause For her despondency: her infirm health, Which was at first the effect of this, perchance Is now its only cause. But her deep grief Deserves much pity, be it what it may; Nor should she wake in thee, more than in us, Any dissatisfaction. A sweet solace Thou wilt be of her ills: on thy firm love Her hopes are founded all. What stronger proof Would'st thou require than this? She will herself At all events abandon us to-morrow; (Us, who so dearly love her) and for this Th' assign'd inducement is to be with thee More uniformly; to become more thine. Pe. Ah, could I trust to this? but 'specially This her abrupt departure ... Ah, I tremble, Lest she designs in secret to make me Th' instrument of her death. Ce. Pereus, to thee Do we confide her: fate to-day decrees it. Too certainly before our very eyes Here would she fall extinct, if to her will Our hearts permitted us to persevere In opposition. Change of place and scene Potently operates on youthful minds. Then lay aside all inauspicious thoughts; And think alone of making her more happy. Bring to thy countenance its wonted cheer; And by avoiding mention of her grief, Soon wilt thou see that grief itself subside. Pe. May I believe then, certainly believe, That Myrrha hates me not? Cin. From me thou may'st Believe it, yes! What heretofore I said Remember! by her words I'm now convinced, That far from being the source of her distress, She deems these nuptials her sole remedy. She must be treated with indulgence; thus She will submit to any thing. Go thou; Quickly prepare thyself for festive pomp; And at the same time every thing dispose For taking from us by to-morrow's dawn Our only daughter. We will not assemble Before the altar of the public temple In sight of all the inhabitants of Cyprus; For the long rite would be an obstacle To your abrupt departure. We will chaunt The hymeneal anthems in this palace. Pe. Thou hast restored me suddenly to life. I fly; and here will instantly return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Euryclea, Myrrha. My. Yes, Euryclea, thou beholdest me Completely tranquillized; and almost joyous, At my resolved departure. Eu. Can this be? ... Alone with Pereus wilt thou hence depart? ... Nor of so many of thy faithful hand-maids Wilt thou select even one? Not even me Wilt thou distinguish from this wide neglect? ... What will become of me, my dearest child, If thou abandon me? alas, I feel Ready to die at the mere thought of this ... My. Ah! hold thy peace ... One day I shall return ... Eu. Ah! may the Heavens grant this! Beloved daughter! ... I did not think that thou wert capable Of such a stern resolve: I always hoped That thou at last would'st close my dying eyes ... My. I should have chosen thee, and thee alone, If I, by any means, could have resolved To take an inmate of this palace with me ... But against this am I inflexible ... Eu. And at to-morrow's dawn thou go'st from hence? ... My. I from my parents have at length obtain'd Permission to do this; the rising sun Will see our vessel wafted from this shore. Eu. Auspicious be the day to thee! ... Could I Know thou wert really happy! ... 'Tis in truth, A cruel and a mortifying joy, That thou dost manifest in leaving us ... Yet, if it please thee, I will weep, though mute, With thy aflicted mother ... My. Wherefore thus My heart already too assailable Dost thou assail? Why force me thus to weep? ... Eu. Oh! how can I suppress my bursting tears ... This is the last time that I shall behold, And shall embrace thee. Thou forsakest me With many years bow'd down, and still more bow'd With wretchedness. I shall be in my grave At thy return, if that should ever be: Some tears, I hope that, ... thou at least wilt give ... To the remembrance ... of thy Euryclea ... My. For pity's sake ... oh! ... quit me; ... or at least Be silent.âI command thee, hold thy peace. It is my duty now to be to all Inflexible; and chiefly to myself.â This is a day sacred to nuptial joy. Oh, if thou e'er hast loved me, I require Of thee to-day the last hard proof of this; Restrain thy tears, ... and mine.âI see already My consort coming.âLet all grief be mute. SCENE THE SECOND. Pereus, Myrrha, Euryclea. Pe. Thy father, Myrrha, hath transported me With unexpected joy: my destiny, Which I expected trembling, he himself Hath cheerfully announced to me as happy. Since thou wilt have it so, by morrow's dawn, At thy command, my sails shall be unfurl'd. It pleases me at least, thy parents yield Contentedly and placidly to this: For me no other pleasure there can be Save that of satisfying thy desires. My. Yes, much-loved consort; for by this fond name Already I accost thee; if a wish My bosom ever fervently inspired, Now do I wish intensely, nay I will, To-morrow, at the break of day, to part From hence with thee. To find myself at once With thee alone; no longer to behold One of the many objects in my sight So long the witnesses, and perhaps the cause, Of my distress; to sail in unknown seas; To land in countries hitherto unseen; To breathe a fresh invigorating air; And evermore to witness at my side, Beaming with exultation, and with love, A spouse like thee; all this, I am convinced, Will renovate me soon a second time To be what once I was. Less irksome, then, I trust that I shall be to thee. Meanwhile My state will stand in need of some indulgence; But, be assured that this will not last long. My grief, if never to my mind recall'd, Will be eradicated soon. Do thou, Of my abandon'd and paternal realm, Of my disconsolate and childless parents, In short, of nothing, that was once my own, Once precious to my heart, ever remind me, Nor even breathe to me their thrilling names. This, this will be the only remedy That will for ever staunch the bitter fount Of my perpetual and horrible tears. Pe. Strange and unparallel'd is thy design, Oh Myrrha: ah may heaven in mercy grant That thou may'st not, when 'tis too late, repent it! Yet though my heart the flattering thought admits not Of being dear to thee, I am resolved Blindly t'accomplish every wish of thine. Provided that my destiny decree That I should ne'er be worthy of thy love, My life, which only for thy sake I keep, (That life which I had sacrificed already With my own hand, if I had been to-day Forced to relinquish thee) this life of mine, Since for this sacred purpose thou hast deign'd To make a choice of me, I consecrate For ever to thy grief.âTo weep with thee, If thou desire it; with festivity, And mirthful sports, to make the time pass by With lighter wings, and cheat thee of thy cares; With strenuous watchfulness, t'anticipate All thy desires; to shew myself at all times, Whichever most thou wishest me to be, Consort, protector, brother, friend, or servant; Behold, to what I pledge myself: in this, And this alone, my glory and my life Will all be centred. Yet, by this unmoved, If thou canst never love me, still, methinks, I cannot be the object of thy hate. My. What say'st thou? Learn, ah learn better to know, Better to appreciate thyself and Myrrha! To thy so various endowments, thou Addest such boundless love, that thou deservest A far, far different object to myself. Love in my bosom will enshrine his fires, When he has clear'd it of its blighting tears. And oh, to-day, be pleased to accept it, thou, An ample and indubitable proof Of this, that I select thyself alone As with medicinable power endow'd To heal my bosom's festering malady; That I esteem thee, that with lofty voice I hail thee as my only true deliverer. Pe. Thou dost inflame me with excessive joy: Never till now did accents sweet as these Flow from thy beauteous lips: within my heart Engraved in characters of fire they live.â Behold the priests, and the hymeneal train, And our dear parents, hitherward advance. Ah! may this moment be to thee propitious, As it hath been the brightest of my life. SCENE THE THIRD. Priests, Chorus of Children, Virgins, and old Men, Cinyras, Cecris, People, Myrrha, Pereus, Euryclea. Cin. Beloved children, I infer, at least, A joyful augury from seeing you Precede us thus to the hymeneal rite. On thy face Pereus transport is express'd; And I behold my daughter's countenance Serene and resolute. The immortal gods With looks benign assuredly regard us, With copious incense be the altars heap'd; While the full choir with pealing harmony Propitiates the gods, and to the skies Breathed acceptably forth from hearts devout Our loud, and long resounding hymns ascend. CHORUS. Hymen, benignant god, brother of Love, Of frail humanity the soothing friend, On us propitiously do thou descend;â And bid henceforth these happy votaries prove A flame so pure from thy inspiring breath, That nothing may extinguish it but death. CHILDREN. Come to us, Hymen, with triumphant joy, Borne on thy brother's wings descend below; VIRGINS. With his own craft deceive the treacherous boy Both of his darts, his quiver, and his bow. OLD MEN. But do thou come exempt from all his arts, His soft caprices, and insidious sighs: CHORUS. And deign, oh Hymen, to unite two hearts, In mutual love unmatch'd, with thy firm ties. Eu. Daughter, what ails thee? How thou tremblest? ... Ah ... My. Peace ... peace ... Eu. But yet ... My. No, no; ... I do not tremble. CHORUS. Mother sublime of Hymen, and of Love, A goddess e'en among the gods art thou; Whose high supremacy in heaven above, Or in the earth, none dare to disavow; From old Olympus' heights, oh Venus, deign Upon this pair propitiously to smile; If e'er the rites of this thy sacred isle Thy kind protection haply might obtain. CHILDREN. Those peerless charms from thee derive their birth, Bestow'd on Myrrha with such lavish wealth; VIRGINS. Restoring her once more to joy and health, Be pleased to leave thy image on the earth; OLD MEN. Lastly, make her the mother of a race So noble, that their father may confess, Grandsires, and subjects, that past wretchedness Is all forgotten in their matchless grace. CHORUS. Benignant goddess, gloriously unfold, From the pure empyrean's azure height,â Drawn by thy swans with plumes of downy white, Throned in thy chariot of translucent gold,â Thy form majestical:âand by thy side Conduct thy son:âthy veil of roseate bloomâ Cast o'er thy votaries,âpregnant with perfume;â And let one spirit o'er two forms preside.â Ce. Yes, daughter, yes, with meek subserviency Thou always soughtest to secure the favour Of our all-powerful goddess ... But, alas! ... Thy countenance changes? ... Thou art faint, and trembling? ... And scarce thy faltering knees ... My. For pity's sake, Do not, oh mother, with thy accents bring My constancy to too severe a test. I cannot answer for my countenance; ... But this I know, the purpose of my heart Is steady and immutable. Eu. For her I feel as if my very life would fail. Pe. Ah! more and more her countenance is troubled? ... Whence is this tremor which assaults my frame?â CHORUS. Pure faith, and concord lasting and benign, Have in the bosom of this lofty pair Irrevocably placed their sacred shrine; And fell Alecto would in vain repair To trouble with her torch's lurid glare The lovely bride's firm and unswerving heart; And deadly Discord, frantic with despair, Himself consumes, and curses his weak art, And from the noble pair all powers malign depart. My. What is it that ye say? My heart already By all the baneful furies is assaulted. See them; the rabid sisters round me glare With sable torches, and with snaky scourge; Behold such torches as this Hymen merits ... Cin. Oh heaven! what do I hear? Ce. My child, thou ravest ... Pe. Oh fatal rites! ye ne'er shall be perform'd ... My. But what? The hymns have ceased? ... Who to his breast Thus clasps me? Where am I? What have I said? Am I a spouse already? ... Pe. Thou art not, Myrrha, espoused; nor shalt thou ever be The spouse of Pereus, to thee I swear. Not less intense, but different to thine, The execrable furies tear my heart. Thou hast made me a derision to the world, And to myself, e'en more than I'm to thee, An object of abhorrence: I for this Will not make thee unhappy. Thou hast now, Though 'gainst thy will, fully betray'd thyself: And thou hast finally beyond all doubt Divulged the invincible and long aversion Which thou hast cherish'd towards me. We are happy, That thou hast thus betray'd thyself in time. Now from the self-imposed and hated yoke Art thou released for ever. Safe art thou, And from all ties exempt. Henceforth will I Remove for ever from thy troubled sight My odious presence ... Satisfied, and happy, Thou by my means shalt be ... and thou ere long Shalt learn the last resource that did remain For one, who, hoping to obtain thee, lost thee. SCENE THE FOURTH. Cinyras, Myrrha, Cecris, Euryclea, Priests, Chorus, People. Cin. The rite is now profaned; hence, hence this pomp, This ineffectual pomp: let the hymns cease. Meanwhile, oh priests, withdraw elsewhere.âI will, (A wretched father) weep at least unseen. SCENE THE FIFTH. Cinyras, Myrrha, Cecris, Euryclea. Eu. Ah! far more dead than living Myrrha stands: Behold, I scarcely can support her form. Oh daughter! ... Cin. Ladies, leave her to herself A prey, and to her own flagitious furies. She, with her unexampled waywardness, Spite of myself, at last hath render'd me Inflexible and cruel: for her state No more I feel compassion. She herself, Almost against the wishes of her parents, Would to the altar come: and this alone To o'erwhelm us with her own disgrace and ours? ... Thou too compassionate, deluded mother, Leave her: if hitherto we were not stern, The day at length is come to be so. My. Yes. 'Tis as it should be: Cinyras, be thou With me inexorable: for nought else I wish; nought else I will. He, he alone Can terminate all the disquietudes Of an unhappy and unworthy daughter.â That which is now dependent at thy side ... That vengeful sword ... plunge it within my breast ... Thou gav'st to me this wretched hated life, Take thou it from me: lo! the last, last gift For which I supplicate thee ... Ah, reflect, That if thyself, and with thy own right hand, Do not destroy me, thou reservest me ... ... And for nought else ... to perish by my own. Cin. O daughter! ... Ce. Oh unutterable anguish! ... Ah! thou'rt a father; thou a father art; ... Wherefore exasperate her? ... Is she not Sufficiently afflicted? ... Thou seest clearly That she is scarce the mistress of herself; Her reason sinks beneath her mighty anguish ... Eu. Oh Myrrha ... daughter ... dost thou hear me not? My tears ... prevent ... my utterance ... Cin. Oh state! ... By such a terrible sight I am o'ercome ... Ah yes, I am e'en yet too much a father: And of all fathers most unfortunate ... Already by compassion more than rage Am I possess'd. I will betake myself Elsewhere to weep. Watch ye meanwhile o'er her.â When she has regain'd her reason, speedily, She afterwards must hear her father speak. SCENE THE SIXTH. Cecris, Myrrha, Euryclea. Eu. Ah see, once more her senses she resumes ... Ce. Leave me alone with her, good Euryclea; I would speak to her. SCENE THE SEVENTH. Cecris, Myrrha. My. Is my father gone? ... He then, he will not kill me? Ah, do thou In pity, mother, give to me a sword; Ah yes, if there indeed remains in thee The shadow of regard for me, a sword, Give me thyself without delay. I am In full possession of my faculties; And well I know the mighty consequence Of this my fervent prayer: ah trust for once My judgment; trust it while there yet is time: Thou wilt repent hereafter, but in vain, If thou to-day grantest me not a sword. Ce. Beloved child, ... oh heaven! ... assuredly From grief thou ravest.âFrom thy mother thou Would'st never ask a sword ...âNow, let us speak No more of nuptial rites: a strength of mind Not to be parallel'd, hath led thee on To accomplish what thou promisedst; but, ah! Stronger than thou was nature: fervently For this I thank the gods. Thou e'er shalt be Clasp'd in the arms of thy indulgent mother: And if to eternal tears thou'rt self-condemn'd, I will weep also evermore with thee, Nor ever, even for an instant, leave thee: We will be one in all things; e'en thy grief, Since it will not abandon thee, will I Appropriate to myself. And thou shalt find In me a sister, rather than a mother ... But what, oh heaven, is this? ... Beloved child, ... Art thou incensed 'gainst me? ... repellest me? ... Refusest to embrace me? ... and dost dart Indignant and exasperated looks ... Alas! ... oh daughter, ... e'en towards thy mother? ... My. Ah! too much it increases my despair, Even the seeing thee: thou, more and more, Rendest my heart when thou embracest me ... Alas! ... what do I say? ... Beloved mother! ... A vile, flagitious, and unworthy daughter Am I, who love deserve not. Leave thou me To my dire destiny; or if thou feel For me true pity, I repeat it to thee, Kill me.â Ce. Ah, rather I should kill myself, If I were doom'd to lose thee: cruel daughter! Canst thou speak to me, and repeat to me So horrible a wish?âRather, will I From this hour forth perpetually watch Over thy life. My. Thou, thou o'er my life watch? Must I, at every instant, I, behold thee? Thou evermore before my eyes? Ah first, I will that these same eyes of mine be closed In everlasting darkness: I myself With these my very hands would pluck them first From my own forehead ... Ce. What say'st thou? ... oh heaven! ... Thou mak'st me shudder. Then thou hatest me? ... My. Thou first, thou sole, fatal, eternal cause Of all my wretchedness ... Ce. What words are these? ... Oh daughter! ... I the cause? ... But see thy tears Gush forth in torrents ... My. Pardon, pardon me! ... It is not I that speak; an unknown power Rules my distemper'd organs ... Dearest mother! Too much thou lovest me; and I ... Ce. Dost thou Deem me the cause? My. Yes, thou, alas! hast been In giving life to such an impious wretch The cause of all my woes; and art so still, If thou refusest now to take it from me; Now that I importune thee for this deed So fervently. There yet is time for this; Yet I am innocent ... almost ...âBut oh! Against such agonies ... my languid frame ... No more bears up ...âMy strength, ... my senses fail ... Ce. To thy apartments suffer me to lead thee. Thou need'st some cordial to restore thy strength. This transient frenzy, trust me, hath arisen From too long fasting. Ah, come thou; in me Fully confide; I, I alone will serve thee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Cinyras. Cin. Oh, ill-starr'd, wretched Pereus! Too true lover! ... Ah, had I been more swift in my arrival, Thou hadst not then perchance against thy breast The fatal weapon aim'd.âWhen he knows this, What will become of his disconsolate father? Espoused and joyful he expected him; Now will he see him brought before his eyes, Slain by his own hands, an inanimate corse.â But I, alas! am I then less than he Disconsolate as a father? And is this life, This state, in which, amid atrocious furies, The frantic Myrrha languishes? This life, To which we're doom'd by her mysterious pangs?â Yet will I question her; and I have arm'd My heart in iron mail. She well deserves (And this she knows) my anger; as a proof She tardily obeys my summons hither: Yet my command hath she already heard By the third messenger.âAssuredly Beneath these pangs of her's there is conceal'd Some mystery no less dreadful than important. I, from her lips, will now hear all the truth, Or never, never more will I henceforth Admit her to my presence ... But, oh heaven, If she's condemn'd to everlasting tears, Though innocent, by force of destiny, And by the anger of offended gods, Should I to such calamities as these Add the displeasure of a father? ... Should I, Despairing, and despised, abandon her To lingering death? ... Alas, at such a thought My heart would break ... But, yet, in part, at least, 'Tis indispensable that I should hide, From her, in this my last experiment, My boundless fondness. Never hath she yet Heard me address her in reproachful terms: No maiden surely hath a heart so firm As may suffice to hear without emotion The unaccustom'd menace of a father.â At length she comes.âAlas, how she approaches With tardy and reluctant steps! It seems As if she came to expire before my eyes. SCENE THE SECOND. Cinyras, Myrrha. Cin. âMyrrha, I never, never could have thought That thou regardedst not thy father's honour; Thou hast too certainly of this convinced me On this day fatal to us all: but yet That thou should'st now reluctantly obey Th'express repeated summons of thy father, E'en this was less expected than the other. My. ... Thou of my life art arbiter supreme ... I did implore from thee ... myself ... erewhile ... And on this very spot, ... the punishment ... Of my so many, ... and enormous faults ... In the presence of my mother; ... wherefore then Didst thou not kill me? ... Cin. It is time, oh Myrrha, Yes it is time to alter thy deportment. In vain thou utterest accents of despair; In vain despairing, and confounded looks Thou fixest on the ground. Through all thy grief Alas, too evidently shame appears; Guilty thou feel'st thyself. Thy heaviest fault Is thy concealment with thy father: hence His anger thoroughly thou meritest; And that the partial and indulgent love I bore to thee, my dear and only daughter, Henceforth should cease.âBut what? thy tears gush forth! Thou tremblest! shudderest! ... and thou art silent! Would then thy father's anger be to thee An insupportable infliction? My. Ah! ... Worse, ... than the worst of deaths ... Cin. Hear me.âThou hast Render'd thy parents, as thou hast thyself, A fable to the world, by th'untoward issue To which thou'st brought these rites desired by thee. Thy cruel insult has cut short already The days of wretched Pereus ... My. What do I hear? Cin. Yes, Pereus dies; and thou hast murder'd him. Soon as he left our presence, he withdrew, Alone, and by mute anguish overwhelm'd, To his apartments: no man durst pursue him; And I arrived too late ... He lay, transfix'd By his own dagger, in a sea of blood: To me, his eyes bedimm'd with tears, and death, He raised; ... and, 'mid his latest sighs, he breathed The name of Myrrha from his lips.âUngrateful ... My. Ah, say no more to me ... I, I alone Deserve to breathe my last ... And yet I live? ... Cin. The horrid anguish of the wretched sire Of Pereus, I alone can comprehend, I who at once am wretched and a father: Hence I'm aware what now must be his rage, His hatred, and his thirst to wreak on us A just and bitter vengeance.âHence, not moved By terror of his arms, but by a just Compassion for his son, I am resolved To know from thee, as doth befit a father Offended and deceived, (and at all risks Do I insist on this) the real cause Of such a horrible catastrophe.â Myrrha, in vain would'st thou conceal it from me: Thou by thy each least gesture art betray'd.â Thy broken words; the changes of thy face, Now dyed with scarlet, and with hues of death Now blanch'd; thy mute and bosom-heaving sighs; The lingering hectic that consumes thy frame; Thy restless glances stol'n and indirect; Thy dumb confusion; and the cleaving shame, Th'instinctive consciousness that ne'er forsakes thee: ... Ah! all that I behold in thee persuades me, And ineffectually would'st thou deny it, That these thy furies are th'effects of love. My. Of love? ... Ah, think it not! ... Thou art deceived. Cin. The more that thou deniest it, the more I am convinced of this. And I, alas! Am but too well assured, that this thy flame, Which thou so pertinaciously dost hide, To some degrading object owes its birth. My. Alas! ... why thus deliberate? ... Thou wilt not Destroy me with thy sword; ... and thou meanwhile ... Destroyest me with words ... Cin. And darest thou Assert to me that thou'rt untouch'd by love? And should'st thou say it to me, and e'en dare Also to swear it, I should deem thee perjured.â And who is ever worthy of thy heart, If Pereus, true, incomparable lover, Could not indeed obtain it?âBut so fierce Are thy emotions; ... such thy agitation; So conscious and so passionate thy shame; And in such terrible vicissitudes The conflict of these passions is engraved Upon thy countenance, that all in vain Thy lips deny the charge ... My. Ah, would'st thou then ... E'en in thy presence ... make me ... die ... of shame? ... And thou art a father? ... Cin. And would'st thou with cruel, Inflexible, and unavailing silence, Poison, and prematurely terminate The days of a fond father who loves thee Far better than himselfâI'm yet a father: Banish thy fear; whatever be thy love, (So that I once might see thee happy) I, If thou confess it to me, for thy sake, Am capable of any sacrifice. I have seen, and I still see (wretched daughter) The struggle generous and horrible Which tears thy heart to pieces betwixt love And duty. Thou hast done too much already, To sense of right self-sacrificed, but love, More powerful than thyself, forbids the offering. Passion may be excused; its impulses Oft foil our best endeavours to resist them; But to withhold thy secret from thy father, Who prays for, who commands, thy confidence, Admits of no excuse. My. âOh death! oh death! Whom I so much invoke, wilt thou still be Deaf to my grief? ... Cin. Ah daughter, try to calm, Ah try to calm thy heart: if thou wilt not Make me hereafter more incensed against thee, I am already almost pacified; Provided thou wilt speak to me.âAh speak To me, as to a brother. Even I Love by experience know: ... The name ... My. Oh heaven! ... I love, yes; since thou forcest me to say it; I desperately love, and love in vain. But who's the object of that hopeless passion, Nor thou, nor any one, shall ever know: He knows it not himself ... and even I To my own consciousness almost deny The fatal secret. Cin. And I will, and ought To wrest it from thy keeping. Nor canst thou Be cruel to thyself, except thou be At the same time still more so to thy parents, Who thee adore, thee only.âSpeak, ah speak.â Thou seest already from an angry father That I become a weeping, kneeling suppliant: Thou canst not die without condemning us To share thy tomb.âHe, whosoe'er he be, Whom thou dost love, I will that he be thine. A monarch's foolish pride can never tear The affection of a father from my breast. Thy love, thy hand, my realm, may well convert The lowest individual to a rank Lofty and noble: and I feel assured That he whom thou could'st love, could never be Wholly unworthy, though of humble birth. I do conjure thee, speak: at all events, I wish thee saved. My. Saved? ... Of what dost thou dream? ... These very words accelerate my death ... Let me, for pity's sake, ah let me quickly For ever ... drag myself ... from thee ... Cin. Oh daughter Sole, and beloved; Oh what say'st thou? Ah! Come to thy father's arms.âOh heaven! Like one Distract, and frantic, thou repellest me? Thou then dost hate thy father? and dost thou Burn with so vile a passion that thou fearest ... My. Ah no, it is not vile; ... my flame is guilty; Nor ever ... Cin. What is this thou sayest? ... Guilty? Provided that thy sire condemn it not, It cannot be: reveal it. My. Thou would'st see Even that sire himself with horror shudder, If it were known to ... Cinyras ... Cin. What do I hear? My. What have I said? ... Alas! ... I know not what I say ... I do not love ... Ah, think it not; oh no! ... Ah, suffer me, I for the last time fervently conjure thee To hasten from thy presence. Cin. Hard of heart! ... Now, by exasperating thus my rage With thy fantastic moods, by trifling thus With my excessive grief, eternally Now hast thou forfeited thy father's love. My. Oh cruel, bitter, and ferocious menace! ... Now in the anguish of my dying gasp, Swiftly approaching ... to my pangs so dire, So various, and so fierce, will now be added The cruel execration of a father! ... I shall die frar from thee ... and die unpitied! ... How fortunate my mother! ... She, at least, Press'd in thy arms ... may breathe ... her latest sigh ... Cin. What would'st thou say to me? ... What dreadful light Breaks from these words! ... Thou impious, perchance ... My. Oh heaven! ... what have I said indeed? ... Alas! Oh wretched me! ... Where am I? ... Whither now Shall I betake myself? Where shall I die?â But now thy dagger may bestead me! ... She suddenly seizes the dagger of her father, and stabs herself with it. Cin. Daughter! ... What hast thou done? My dagger ... My. Lo! ... to thee ... I now restore it ... I at least possess'd A hand as swift and desperate as my tongue. Cin. I'm petrified ... with fear ... and agony, With pity ... and with rage ... My. Oh Cinyras! ... Thou ... seest me ... now ... expiring ... in thy presence ... I have ... at once ... succeeded ... to avenge Thee ... and myself ... to punish ... âThou thyself, ... By dint of violence, ... from my heart ... didst wrest ... The horrid secret ... But since ... with my life ... It parted ... from my lips, ... I die ... less guilty ... Cin. Oh crime! ... oh agony!âTo whom my tears?â My. Ah, weep not thou; ... I merit not thy tears ... Shun my contagious presence; ... and conceal ... Form Cecris ... ever ... Cin. Wretchedest of fathers! ... And does the gaping earth not burst asunder To swallow me alive? ... I dare not now Approach the dying and flagitious damsel; ... Yet how can I abandon utterly My immolated daughter? ... SCENE THE THIRD. Cecris, Euryclea, Cinyras, Myrrha. Ce. By the shrieks Of death brought hither ... Cin. Do not thou advance ... He runs to meet Cecris, and preventing her from advancing, he intercepts from her the sight of Myrrha dying. Oh heaven! ... Ce. To my daughter's side ... My. Oh voice! ... Eu. Ah spectacle of horror! On the earth Myrrha lies weltering in her blood! ... Ce. My daughter! ... Cen. Stop. Ce. Murder'd! ... How? By who? ... I will behold her ... Cin. Ah stop, ... and hear with terror ... By my dagger She, with her own hand, has transpierced herself ... Ce. And dost thou thus desert thy daughter? ... Ah! I will myself ... Cin. She is no more our daughter. With an incestuous and horrid love She burn'd for ... Cinyras ... Ce. What do I hear?â Oh crime! ... Cin. Ah come! I pray thee let us go, To die with agony and shame elsewhere. Ce. Impious! ...âOh daughter! Cin. Ah come! ... Ce. Ah unhappy! ... Nor ever more embrace her! ... She is dragged away by Cinyras. SCENE THE FOURTH. Myrrha, Euryclea. My. When I ask'd ... It ... of thee, ... thou, ... oh Euryclea, ... then ... Shouldest ... have given ... to my hands ... a sword: ... I had died ... guiltless; ... guilty ... now ... I die!</field>
