      <field name="fulltext">THE DOWNFALL AND DEATH OF KING ŒDIPUS A Drama in Two Parts CHIEFLY TAKEN FROM THE ŒDIPUS TYRANNUS AND COLONEUS OF SOPHOCLES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Charles Eliot Norton. My dear Norton, Some while ago you asked me to complete a version of the Œdipus Tyrannus and Coloneus of Sophocles, which had been lying by me some years. Here they are at last, the two Tragedies united into one Drama under the ponderous alliteration which figures on the Title-page; for which, however, I could hit on no so comprehensive a substitute. If you can, pray do so. There also, you see that my Drama professes to be neither a Translation, nor a Paraphrase of Sophocles, but “chiefly taken” from him: I need scarcely add, only intended for those who do not read the Greek. As you, however, to whom I send it, are a Scholar, who not only knows, but reveres the original, I shall try to excuse some of the liberties which I have taken with it. For my very free treatment of what I have retained you are already sufficiently prepared; not so, perhaps, for the much I have omitted: still less for one audacious substitution of my own work for that of Sophocles in what I may call the Second Act in the Second Part of my Play. Well, then, to begin with the more venial sins of omission. You will see that I have dispensed with all (including what I belive is called the Kommos) which follows the narration of the catastrophe as related by the several witnesses; as I think is the case in some of the Tragedies of Euripides. What Professor Paley says of the Kommos which terminates the Persæof Æchylus must, I think, be true of all: that, whatever effect the vehement recitation might add to it, the Dialogue is secondary to the Spectacle—by which I understand him to mean those outward signs of woe which are implied in the name. Even as I venture to believe—proh Scholasticus!—that in most of the Lyric Chorus (unless in the case of Æschylus) the words are secondary to the Lyre: are; in fact, a kind of better Libretto for the Music. However this may be with Ode or Kommos, I think no English reader will care to have the horror of the catastrophe in the first Play increased, even to his Mind's eye, by the exhibition of the poor self-blinded King staggering into the public street, whither his two daughters have been summoned to weep, and be wept over by him. In the original, you know, the spectacle he presents is much more revolting—a spectacle indeed of royal degradation surely worse than any which Aristophanes satirised in Euripides. And is not the catastrophe when told of as being accomplished within doors, more terrible, though less horrible, than when exhibited without? And, on the other hand, does not a reader find the impression left on him by the grand catastrophe of the Coloneus dissipated rather than enhanced by the Lamentations which follow, and conclude the Tragedy? Thus far I do not think you will much differ from me: but what will you say to the disappearance of two principal Characters from the Dramatis Personæ—that of Creon from the first Play, and that of Ismene from the second? Œdipus, you know, has involved Creon in the same groundless charge of Treason which he brings against Teiresias; and, after much and violent altercation with the Prophet, turns with yet more vindictive fury upon the Prince, who comes to vindicate himself from the charge. From all which little results except to show that the Creon of this Play (the Tyrannus) proves himself by his temperate self-defence, and subsequent forbearance toward his accuser, very unlike the Creon of the two after Tragedies, which Goethe thought should be regarded as parts of a connected Trilogy—a theory which is not favoured either by this dissimilarity of character in the several Tragedies, or by the dates usually assigned to the composition of each; the Antigone being reputed as among the earlier, and the Coloneus, as tradition tells, the very last of all the Poet's works. As for Ismene—her cautious refusal to help in burying her revolted brother may not be inconsistent with her singular exploit of riding alone to Athens to acquaint her banished father with what is plotting against him in Thebes. But her arrival brings with it more of paternal and filial effusion than comes within the compass of my Play. So I pretend that some loyal Theban—she, if you please, on her Sicilian filly—had told all that was to be told previously to the opening of the Play: and thus Ismene ‘disappears from my Playbill’ altogether. And Œdipus seems to me to present us a no less pathetic figure when accompanied only by the one daughter who is traditionally associated with him as the type of filial, as afterward of sisterly, devotion. The disappearance of the two sisters along with that Kommos from the first Play helps to connect it with the second in point of Time, without, I think, diminishing the interest of either. In the Tyrannus, you know, Œdipus appears as a man little, if at all, beyond the prime of life. He came quite young, he tells us, to Thebes; his unlucky marriage, by which the State thought to confirm his other claims to the throne, would, for the same reasons, be not long delayed; those two daughters of his are scarce in their teens—certainly not marriageable—when brought in to him just before his expulsion; which, as the life of Thebes depended on it, must have followed immediately on his conviction. Creon, at any rate, must have been, by his ill-starr'd relation with Œdipus, considerably the older of the two; and he, we see, is capable of very active service both in the Coloneus and Antigone. And certainly if Oedipus became an old man between the time of his leaving Thebes, and that of his arrival at Athens, Antigone, who figures along with him in both the original Tragedies, may, on her subsequent return to Thebes, have been a suitable bride in point of years to Creon's son Hæmon, but scarcely such as he would have been so much enamoured of as to sacrifice himself at her side. Nevertheless, in the original Coloneus, Œdipus has become an old—I think, a very old man. Our own Theatre—our own Shakespeare—has ‘jumped the life’ of his people over as wide an interval in the compass of a single Play as Sophocles has done in two several Tragedies: but, especially if considering them as parts of a Trilogy, one cannot help asking one's self where, in all the little world of Greece, Œdipus could have found Space to wander in all the Time. Perhaps, however, so ran the Legend; or Sophocles considered that, as usual, I think, in ancient Tragedy—the ‘Pity of it“ was increased by adding the weight of old age to blindness and calamity. I do not question that: but is it so with the grandeur of his præternatural ‘taking off,’ if determined to a time of life when death in some way or other is inevitable? So much for omission. And now for my capital act of treason committed against Sophocles, amounting to nothing less than the re-casting of the whole Second Act (as I call it) of the Coloneus, including Creon's bootless expedition to Athens. I never understood, though I doubt not the Athenian audience approved, that coming of his with a consdierable force (as in the original he does) unprevented—uninterrupted, and apparently unobserved, under the very walls of their City, and seizing on those who were taking refuge there. Insomuch that, when King Theseus, alarmed by the outcries of the Chorus, comes to the rescue, Antigone and Ismene have already been forced away by some of Creon's people, and Œdipus only just escapes being carried off by Creon himself. In re-casting all this, I hope that whatever wrong I may have done Sophocles, King Theseus, at any rate, has not suffered indignity at my hands, if Creon be made to regard him of sufficient account as to apprize him before advancing to his walls; not with the rash design of seizing and carrying off those who are under his protection; but to prevail on them, if he can, by fair argument, to return to Thebes: Theseus standing between the two parties to hear, if not to judge, what has to be said on either side. And on that score also I have something to say. Up to this visit of Creon's, I could never see any just ground for the rancorous hate which Œdipus entertains and exhibits toward Creon or toward his own sons, which occupies so much of the coloneus with imprecations, that remind one of Lear's against his daughters, but without as much reason, and therefore without engaging our sympathy on his behalf. For how stands the case? Phœbus had announced that, until the murder of King Laius were avanged, Thebes would not rid herself of the Plague that was devouring her: Œdipus denounces Excommunication on the Criminal; convicts himself For, so far as I see, the sole surviving witness of the deed whom he has ultimately—(not immediately, as would Justice Shallow)—sent for to decide the question, had not yet arrived; or, being, as the Chorus surmises, the same who convicts (Œdipus of his fatal parentage, is not interrogated at all as to his Father's murder.; and, after putting out his own eyes, calls aloud for Thebes to execute the sentence he had called down upon himself, whether by banishment or death. Creon, however, who is now left in charge of the City, decides, with the concurrence of Œdipus' two sons, that banishment will be sufficient accomplishment of the Oracle; and Œdipus is accordingly banished. He soon indeed repents of his rash self-denunciation, and prays to be restored to Thebes: but how could that be until the God, by Oracle or Augury, should sanction his return, without danger of bringing back the Plague which he took away with him? And when the Oracle at last declares that Thebes can only secure herself from her enemies by repossessing herself of her old King, it is on the strange condition that she is to keep her treasure, whether alive or dead, upon neighbouring territory, for the very reason that he is polluted by his father's blood. Not a satisfactory arrangement for him, whatever it might be for Thebes. But for this, and for all thus far, the Gods were responsible, not Creon and the sons upon whom he fulminates his wrath. But when Creon appears, and afterward Polynices, to persuade, if not to force him home, he being apprised of their ulterior intentions regarding him, we do not wonder at his blazing up against their selfish duplicity. But still it is, I think, their previous ill-usage (as he thinks it), rather than their present design upon him, which mainly supplies the fuel of his wrath. Now, had his first expulsion been aggravated by unnecessary cruelty and insult on their part; and had they persisted in keeping him out when the Gods, under some favourable auspices, might have been suposed to license his return to Thebes, polluted as he might still be with the blood which had not prevented his reigning there for so many years before: I think he would have been furnished with such reason for his Fury as would have carried our feelings along with him. And, whatever ancient Legend or Mythology might say, neither of them was very impracticable, had the Poet chosen to deal with them as I have ventured on doing with him. While doing, as well as saying all this, I am sure you will understand that I am not pretending to improve on Sophocles whether as a Poet or a Dramatist. As for Poetry, I pretend to very little more than representing the old Greek in sufficiently readable English verse: and whatever I have omitted, added, or altered, has been with a view to the English reader of To-day, without questioning what was fittest for an Athenian theatre more than two thousand years ago. Those great ancient Tragedians were not, any more than their audiences, nice about such consistencies and probabilities as any modern playwright would provide for, and, so far, be the better for it. One modification of the original not even the English Scholar—I do not mean, Scholastic—would resent; namely, leaving the terrible story to develope itself no further than needs it must to be intelligible, without being descanted, dwelt, and dilated on, after the fashion of Greek Tragedy. As I thought I should do no better with the Choruses than old Potter, I have left them, as you see, in his hands, though worthy of a better Interpreter than either of us; all of them, I say, excepting the two fragments which might otherwise be imputed to him: one at page 388 of the First Part during which Iocasta is supposed to be making her oblations at the altar before the Corinthian Herald interrupts her: secondly, at page 455 of the Second Part, by way of giving Theseus a little while before he enters on the scene to which he has been so hastily summoned: and, lastly, the little Choral morality which ends each play. You say that good literal Prose translation would be better than Potter. So think I too in some respects; but with Potter the Lyric Form, so essential to the conception of Greek Tragedy, is retained, if nothing else: though some grand piece of appropriate organ music would answer the purpose much better. What I meant for a written letter has grown to such a length—and long-windedness, I fear—that it shall even go to the printer along with the play which it prates about, and, at any rate, give you no trouble in deciphering. Pray mark down what you see amiss in both: and belive me yours, as ever, sincerely, Littlegrange. [February, 1880.]</field>

You, whose grave aspect and investiture Announce the chosen oracle of all, Tell me the purport: I am here, you see, As King, and Father of his people too, To listen and what in me lies to do; For surely mine were but a heart of stone Not to be moved by such an embassy, Nor feel my people's sorrows as my own. Priest. O Œdipus, our Father, and our King! Of what a mingled company you see This Supplication gather'd at your door; Ev'n from the child who scarce has learn'd to creep, Down to old age that little further can, With all the strength of life that breathes between. You know how all the shatter'd city lies Reeling a-wreck, and cannot right herself Under the tempest of this pestilence, That nips the fruitful growth within the bud, Strangles the struggling blossom in the womb, With sudden death infects the living man, Until the realm of Cadmus wastes, and Thebes With her depopulation Hades feeds. Therefore, myself and this mute company In supplication at your altar sit, Looking to you for succour; looking not As to a God, but to the Man of men, Most like the God in man's extremity: Who, coming here a stranger to the land, Didst overcome the Witch who with her song Seduced, and slew the wisest and the best; For which all but divine deliverance Thebes Call'd the strange man who saved her to the throne Left void by her hereditary king. And now the kingdom looks to you once more— To you, the Master of the master-mind, To save her in a worse extremity: When men, not one by one, but troop by troop, Fall by a plague more deadly than the Sphinx, Till Thebes herself is left to foreign arms Assailable—for what are wall and tower, Divinely built and founded as they be, Without the rampart of the man within?— And let not what of Cadmus yet survives From this time forth regard you as the man Who saved them once, by worse to perish now. Œd. Alas, my children! telling me of that My people groans with, knowing not yourselves How more than any man among you, I, Who bear the accumulated woes of all; So that you find me, coming when you may, Restlessly all day pacing up and down, Tossing all night upon a sleepless bed, Endeavouring all that of myself I can, And all of Heaven implore—thus far in vain. But if your King have seem'd to pause awhile, 'Tis that I wait the issue of one hope, Which, if accomplish'd, will accomplish all. Creon, my brother, and my second self Beside the throne I sit on, to the shrine Of Delphian Phœbus, man's assured appeal In all his exigence, I have despatch'd: And long before you gather'd at my door Within my soul was fretting, lest To-day That should have lighted him from Delphi back Pass over into night, and bring him not. But come he must, and will; and when he comes, Do I not all, so far as man may do, To follow where the God shall point the way, Denounce me traitor to the State I saved And to the people who proclaim'd me King. Cho. Your words are as a breath from Delphi, King, Prophetic of itself; for even now Fore-running Rumour buzzes in our ear That he whose coming all await is here. Œd. And as before the advent of a God, The moving multitude divides—O Phœbus! Be but the word he carries back to me Auspicious as well-timed! Chorus. And shall no less; For look! the laurel wreath about his brow Can but announce the herald of Success. Œdipus, Creon, Chorus. Œd. Son of Menœceus! Brother! Brother-king!— Oh, let impatience for the word you bring Excuse brief welcome to the messenger! Be but the word as welcome!— Cre. As it shall, Have you your ancient cunning to divine The darker word in which the God of Light Enshrines his answer. Œd. Speak! for till I hear, I know not whether most to hope or fear. Cre. Am I to speak before the people here, Or to yourself within? Œd. Here, before all, Whose common cause it is. Cre. To all then thus: When Delphi reach'd, and at the sacred shrine Lustration, sacrifice, and offering made, I put the question I was charged withal, The Prophetess of the three-footed throne, Conceiving with the vapour of the God Which wrapt her, rising from Earth's centre, round, At length convulsed to sudden answer broke: ‘O seven-gated City, by the Lyre Compact, and peopled from a Dragon Sire! Thebes feeds the Plague that slays her nourishing Within her walls the slayer of her King.’ Œd. The slayer of her King? What king? Cre. None else I know than Laius, son of Labdacus, Who occupied the throne before you came; That much of Oracle, methinks, is plain. Œd. A story rises on me from the past. Laius, the son of Labdacus—of whom I know indeed, but him I never saw. Cre. No; he was slain before you set your foot Over the country's threshold. Œd. Slain! By whom? Cre. That to divine were to interpret all That Œdipus himself is call'd to answer. Thus much is all we know, The King was murder'd by some roving band Of outlaws, who waylaid him on his road To that same Delphi, whither he had gone On some such sacred mission as myself. Œd. Yet of those roving outlaws, one at least Yet breathes among us in the heart of Thebes. Cre. So saith the Oracle. Œd. In the midst of all The citizens and subjects of the King He slew? Cre. So saith the Oracle. Œd. But hold! The story of this treason—all, you say, Now known of it, how first made known in Thebes? Cre. By the one man of the King's retinue, Who having 'scaped the fate which took the rest, As if the assassin's foot were at his heels, Half dead with fear, just reach'd the city gates With breath to tell the story. Œd. And breathes still To tell it once again? Cre. I know not that: For having told it, the bewilder'd man, As fast as hither he had fled, fled hence, Where, if the assassin's foot not on him then, His eye, the God declares, were on him now— So fled he to his native field again Among his flocks and fellow-husbandmen. Œd. And thus the single witness you let slip, Whose eye might ev'n have singled out the man, As him the man's!—Oh, had I but been by, I would have driv'n interrogation home, Would the bewilder'd memory so have sifted Of each minutest grain of circumstance— How many, accoutred how, what people like— Now by the lapse of time and memory, Beyond recall into oblivion pass'd! But not to lose what yet of hope there is— Let him be sent for, sought for, found and brought. Cre. Meanwhile, default of him for whom you send, Or of uncertain memory when he comes, Were it not well, if still the God withhold His revelation of the word we need, To question it of his Interpreter? Œd. Of his Interpreter! Cre. Of whom so well, As of Teiresias, the blind Seer of Thebes, Whose years the God hath in his service counted Beyond all reach of human memory? Œd. So be it. But I marvel yet why Thebes, Letting the witness slip, then unpursued, Or undetected, left the criminal, Whom the King's blood, by whomsoever spilt, Cried out aloud to be revenged upon. Cre. What might be done we did. But how detect The roving robber, in whatever land, Of friend or foe alike, outlaw'd of all, Where ever prey to pounce on on the wing, Or housed in rock or forest, save to him Unknown, or inaccessible? Besides, Thebes soon had other business on her hand. Œd. Why, what of business to engage her more Than to revenge the murder of her King? Cre. None other than the riddle-singing Sphinx Who, till you came to silence her, held Thebes From thinking of the dead to save herself. Œd. And leaving this which then you might have guess'd, To guess at that which none of you could solve, You have brought home a riddle on your heads Inextricable and more fatal far! But I, who put the riddling Witch to rest, This fatal riddle will unravel too, And by swift execution following The revelation, once more save the realm, And wipe away the impiety and shame Of Laius' yet unexpiated death. For were no expiation to the God, And to the welfare of this people due, Were't not a shame thus unrevenged so long To leave the slaughter of so great a King— King Laius, the son of Labdacus, Who from his father Polydore his blood Direct from Cadmus and Agenor drew? Shame to myself, who, sitting on the throne He sat on, wedded to the very Queen Who should have borne him children, as to me She bore them, had not an assassin's hand Divorced them ere their wedded life bore fruit! Therefore to this as 'twere my father's cause, As of my people's—nay, why not my own, Who in his death am threaten'd by the hand Of him, whose eye now follows me about?— With the Gods' aid do I devote myself. And hereto let the city's Herald all Her population summon, from my lips To hear and help in what I shall devise: And you, that with bow'd head and olive wand, Have since the dawn been gather'd at my door, Beseeching me with piteous silence, rise, And by their altars supplicate the Gods, And Phœbus chief of all, that he may turn His yet half-clouded word into full light, And with one shaft of his unerring bow Smite dead the Plague which back into the dust Whence Cadmus raised them lays the People low, Chorus. Thou oracle of Jove, what fate From Pytho's golden shrine Brings to th' illustrious Theban state Thy sweet-breathed voice divine? My trembling heart what terror rends, While dread suspense on thee attends, O Delian Pæan, healing pow'r! Daughter of golden Hope, to me, Blest voice, what now dost thou decree, Or in time's future hour? Daughter of heav'n's almighty lord, Immortal Pallas, hear! And thou, Diana, queen adored, Whose tutelary care Protects these walls, this favour'd state, Amidst the forum 'round whose seat Sublime encircling pillars stand! God of the distant-wounding bow, Apollo, hear; avert our woe, And save the sick'ning land! This realm when former ills opprest, If your propitious pow'r In mercy crush'd the baleful pest, Outrageous to devour; In mercy now extend your care, For all is misery and despair, And vain the counsels of the wise. No fruit, no grain to ripeness grows; The matron feels untimely throes, The birth abortive dies. The Shades, as birds of rapid flight, In quick succession go, Quick as the flames that flash through night, To Pluto's realms below. Th' unpeopled town beholds the dead Wide o'er her putrid pavements spread, Nor graced with tear or obsequy. The altars round a mournful band, The wives, the hoary matrons, stand, And heave the suppliant sigh. With deep sighs mix'd the hallow'd strain Bursts fervent to the skies: Deign then, O radiant Pallas, deign In all thy might to rise. From this fierce pow'r, which raging round Unarm'd inflicts the fiery wound, Daughter of Jove, my country save; Hence, goddess, hence the fury sweep To Amphitrite's chambers deep, Or the rough Euxine wave! Doth aught the Night from ruin spare? The Morning's sickly ray, Pregnant with death, inflames the air, And gives disease its prey. Father of gods, whose matchless force Wings the red lightning's vengeful course, With all thy thunders crush this foe! Potent to aid, Lycéan king, Thy shafts secure of conquest wing, And bend thy golden bow! Thy beams around, Diana, throw, And pierce this gloom of night, As on Lycæum's moss-clad brow Thou pour'st thy silver light! Thy nymphs, O Theban Bacchus, lead, The golden mitre round thy head, Grief-soothing God of wine and joy; Wave thy bright torch, and with its flame This god, to gods an odious name, This lurid Pest destroy! Œdipus, Chorus. Œd. You came to me for counsel; hearken then, And do as well as hearken, like myself Following the pointed finger of the God Which thus far leads us, all may yet be well. I, Œdipus, albeit no Theban born, By Thebes herself enthroned her sovereign King, Thus to the citizens of Thebes proclaim; That whosoever of them knows by whom King Laius, son of Labdacus, was slain, Forthwith let him disclose it undismay'd; Yea, though the criminal himself he were, Let not the dread of deadly consequence Revolt him from confession of the crime; For he shall suffer nothing worse than this, Instant departure from the city, but Uninjured, uninsulted, unpursued; For though feloniously a King he slew Yet haply as a stranger unaware That king was Laius; and thus the crime Half-clear'd of treason, half absolved by time. Nor, on the other hand, if any knows Another guilty, let him not for love, Or fear, or whatsoever else regard, Flinch from a revelation that shall win More from myself than aught he fears to lose— Nay, as a second saviour of the State Shall after me be call'd; and who should not Save a whole people at the cost of one? But Him—that one—who would not at the cost Of self-confession save himself and all— Him—were he nearest to my heart and hearth— Nearest and dearest—thus do I denounce; That from the very moment that he stands, By whatsoever, or by whom, reveal'd, No man shall him bespeak, at home, abroad, Sit with at table, nor by altar stand, But, as the very Pestilence he were Incarnate which this people now devours, Him slay at once, or hoot and hunt him forth, With execration from the city walls. But if, in spite of promise or of threat, The man who did, or knows who did, this deed, Still hold it in his bosom unreveal'd— That man—and he is here among us now— Man's vengeance may escape when he forswears Participation in the crime, but not The Gods', himself involving in the Curse Which, with myself and every man in Thebes, He shall denounce upon the criminal, The Gods invoking to withhold from him That issue of the earth by which he lives, That issue of the womb by which himself Lives after him; that in the deadly curse By which his fellows perish he and his May perish, or, if worse there be, by worse! Cho. Beside Apollo's altar standing here, That oath I swear, that neither I myself Nor did myself, nor know who did this deed: And in the curse I join on him who did, Or, knowing him who did, will not reveal. Œd. 'Tis well: and, all the city's seven gates closed, Thus solemnly shall every man in Thebes Before the altars of his country swear. Cho. Well have you done, O Master, in so far As human hand and wit may reach; and lo! The sacred Seer of Thebes, Teiresias, To whom, next to the God himself, we look For Heaven's assistance, at your summons comes, In his prophetic raiment, staff in hand, Approaching, gravely guided as his wont, But with a step, methinks, unwonted slow. Œdipus, Teiresias, Chorus. Teiresias, Minister and Seer of God, Who, blind to all that others see without, See that within to which all else are blind; Sequester'd as you are with Deity, You know, what others only know too well, The mortal sickness that confounds us all; But you alone can tell the remedy. For since the God whose Minister you are Bids us, if Thebes would be herself again, Revenge the murder of King Laius By retribution on the murderer, Who undetected walks among us now; Unless by you, Teiresias, to whose lips, As Phœbus his Interpreter we cling, To catch the single word that he withholds, And without which what he reveals is vain— Therefore to you, Teiresias, you alone, Do look this people and their Ruler—look, Imploring you, by that same inward light Which sees, to name the man who lurks unseen, And whose live presence is the death of all. Tei. Alas! how worse than vain to be well arm'd When the man's weapon turns upon himself! Œd. I know not upon whom that arrow lights. Tei. If not on him that summon'd, then on him Who, summon'd, came. There is one remedy; Let those who hither led me lead me hence. Œd. Before the single word—which you alone Can speak—be spoken? How is this, Teiresias, That to your King on such a summons come, You come so much distemper'd? Tei. For the King, With all his wisdom, knows not what he asks. Œd. And therefore asks that he may know from you, Seeing the God hath folded up his word From human eyesight. Tei. Why should I reveal What He I serve has chosen to conceal? Œd. Is't not your office to interpret that To man which he for man vouchsafes from Heaven? Tei. What Fate hath fix'd to come to pass come will, Whether reveal'd or not. Œd. I know it must; But Fate may cancel Fate, foretelling that Which, unpredicted, else would come to pass. Tei. Yet none the less I tell you, Œdipus, That you, though wise, not knowing what you ask, I, knowing, shall not answer. Œd. You will not! Inexorable to the people's cries— Plague-pitiless, disloyal to your King— Tei. Oh! you forsooth were taunting me but now With my distemper'd humour— Œd. Who would not, When but a word, which you pretend to know, Would save a people? Tei. One of them at least It would not. Œd. Oh, scarce any man, methinks, But would himself, though guiltless, sacrifice, If that would ransom all. Tei. Yet one, you see, Obdurate as myself— Œd. You have not heard, perchance, Teiresias, (Unless from that prophetic voice within,) How through the city, by my herald's voice, With excommunication, death, or banishment, I have denounced, not him alone who did, But him who, knowing who, will not reveal? Tei. I hear it now. Œd. And are inflexible To Fear as Pity? Tei. It might be, to Fear Inflexible by Pity; else, why fear Invulnerable as I am in Truth, And by the God I serve inviolate? Œd. Is not your King a Minister of Zeus, As you of Phœbus, and the King of Thebes Not more to be insulted or defied Than any Priest or Augur in his realm? Tei. Implore, denounce, and threaten as you may, What unreveal'd I would, I will not say. Œd. You will not! Mark then how, default of your Interpretation, I interpret you: Either not knowing what you feign to know, You lock your tongue in baffled ignorance; Or, knowing that which you will not reveal, I do suspect—Suspect! why, stand you not Self-accused, self-convicted, and by me Denounced as he, that knowing him who did, Will not reveal—nay, might yourself have done The deed that you with some accomplice plann'd, Could those blind eyes have aim'd the murderous hand? Tei. You say so! Now then, listen in your turn To that one word which, as it leaves my lips, By your own Curse upon the Criminal Denounced, should be your last in Thebes to hear. For by the unerring insight of the God You question, Zeus his delegate though you be Who lay this Theban people under curse Of revelation of the murderer Whose undiscover'd presence eats away The people's life—I tell you—You are he! Cho. Forbear, old man, forbear! And you, my King, Heed not the passion of provoked old age. Œd. And thus, in your blind passion of revenge, You think to 'scape contempt or punishment By tossing accusation back on me Under Apollo's mantle. Tei. Ay, and more, Dared you but listen. Cho. Peace, O peace, old man! Œd. Nay, let him shoot his poison'd arrows out; They fall far short of me. Tei. Not mine, but those Which Fate had fill'd my Master's quiver with, And you have drawn upon yourself. Œd. Your Master's? Your Master's; but assuredly not His To whom you point, albeit you see him not, In his meridian dazzling overhead, Who is the God of Truth as well as Light, And knows as I within myself must know If Memory be not false as Augury, The words you put into his lips a Lie! Not He, but Self—Self only—in revenge Of self-convicted ignorance—Self alone, Or with some self whom Self would profit by— As were it—Creon, say—smooth, subtle Creon, Moving by rule and weighing every word As in the scales of Justice—but of whom Whispers of late have reach'd me—Creon, ha! Methinks I scent another Master here! Who, wearied of but secondary power Under an alien King, and would belike Exalt his Prophet for good service done Higher than ever by my throne he stood— And, now I think on't, bade me send for you Under the mask of Phœbus— Cho. Oh, forbear— Forbear, in turn, my lord and master! Tei. Nay, Let him, in turn, his poison'd arrows, not From Phœbus' quiver, shoot, but to recoil When his mad Passion having pass'd— Œd. O vain Prerogative of human majesty, That one poor mortal from his fellows takes, And, with false pomp and honour dressing up, Lifts idol-like to what men call a Throne, For all below to worship and assail! That even the power which unsolicited By aught but salutary service done The men of Thebes committed to my hands, Some, restless under just authority, Or jealous of not wielding it themselves, Ev'n with the altar and the priest collude, And tamper with, to ruin or to seize! Prophet and Seer forsooth and Soothsayer! Why, when the singing Witch contrived the noose Which strangled all who tried and none could loose, Where was the Prophet of Apollo then? 'Twas not for one who poring purblind down Over the reeking entrail of the beast, Nor gaping to the wandering bird in air, Nor in the empty silence of his soul Feigning a voice of God inaudible, Not he, nor any of his tribe—but I— I, Œdipus, a stranger in the land, And uninspired by all but mother-wit, Silenced and slew the monster against whom Divine and human cunning strove in vain. And now again when tried, and foil'd again, This Prophet—whether to revenge the past, And to prevent discomfiture to come, Or by some traitor aiming at my throne Suborn'd to stand a greater at his side Than peradventure e'er he stood at mine, Would drag me to destruction! But beware! Beware lest, blind and agèd as you are, Wrapt in supposititious sanctity, You, and whoever he that leagues with you, Meet a worse doom than you for me prepare. Tei. Quick to your vengeance, then; for this same day That under Phœbus' fiery rein flies fast Over the field of heaven, shall be the last That you shall play the tyrant in. Œd. O Thebes, You never called me Tyrant, from the day Since first I saved you! Tei. And shall save again; As then by coming, by departing now. Enough: before the day that judges both Decide between us, let them lead me home. Œd. Ay, lead him hence—home—Hades—anywhere! Blind in his inward as his outward eye. Tei. Poor man! that in your inward vision blind, Know not, as I, that ere this day go down, By your own hand yourself shall be consign'd To deeper night than now you taunt me with; When, not the King and Prophet that you were, But a detested outcast of the land, With other eyes and hands you feel your way To wander through the world, begging the bread Of execration from the stranger's hand Denied you here, and thrust from door to door, As though yourself the Plague you brought from Thebes; A wretch, self-branded with the double curse Of such unheard, unnatural infamy, As shall confound a son in the embrace Of her who bore him to the sire he slew! Chorus Strophe 1 All yet is dark. What wretch abhorr'd, Grasping with blood-stain'd hand his ruthless sword, From Delphi's high rock-seated shrine Declares the voice divine The author of this horrid deed? Now let him wing his swiftest speed; The son of Jove upon him flies, Arm'd with the flames and lightnings of the skies: Dreadful, resistless in their force The Fates attend his course. Antistrophe 1 The oracle divinely bright To drag the latent murderer into light Shone forth, Parnassus, from thy brow White with eternal snow: For, like a bull, to secret shades, To rocks, to caves, to sylvan glades, Far from the Pythian prophecies Mournful the solitary wanderer flies: In vain: they hover round his head, And ceaseless terrors spread. Strophe 2 Dreadful, dreadful things to hear Utters the prophetic Seer. Him doth truth, doth falsehood guide? Fear and hope my soul divide; Painful suspense! The present and the past Darkening clouds alike o'ercast. Was wrong by Laius done of old, That made the son of Polybus his foe? Such in no record is enroll'd; Nought at this hour of proof I know, Decreeing as the Seer decreed, To charge on Œdipus the secret deed. Antistrophe 2 Jove, high ruler of the skies, And the Pythian god are wise; They the deeds of mortals know, All whate'er is done below: Of knowledge doth the Seer a brighter ray, Than illumines me, display? Some deeper drink of wisdom's spring; But proofs, that flash conviction I demand. The Sphinx display'd her dreadful wing, His wisdom saved the sinking land; Then let my grateful soul disdain To rank the hero with the murderer's train. Iocasta, Chorus, then Œdipus. Ioc. A noise has reach'd me through the palace-wall Of words between Teiresias and the King, In which my brother's name was all misused. You who were here, and heard, can tell me all. Cho. Words there have been indeed on either side, By provocation into passion blown, Which after-thought as likely will disown. Ioc. But to what purport? Cho. I would not repeat What those who utter'd now may wish unsaid, Much more, unheard. But look! the King himself To answer for himself. Ioc. As one who dreams. In Heaven's name, husband, tell me what has fired This wrath between you and Teiresias, So fierce that e'en my brother Creon's name Was scorcht withal, and in its ashes now Still smoulders in your face? Œd. That has been said On either side that should not; but on his, Relying on protection from his God, Treason so foul against his King— Ioc. But what? Œd. Why need tell now, if, as the Prophet says, This very day shall not go down without To Thebes, as you, revealing?—What if I— If I, that have with banishment or death Denounced the assassin of King Laius— Myself am he? Ioc. You! Œdipus? Œd. So says Apollo's prophet. Ioc. You!—Teiresias!—You! On what presumption, Human or Divine? Œd. On His whose chariot shall not cross the sky, But dragging me to Night along with it. Ioc. Which cannot be—we know, which cannot be Of the God's self—you of yourself more sure Than any mortal Prophet sure of Him. Œd. So might I think. But if not from the God, From whom then, Iocasta? Ioc. Only not From Creon—Whosoever else, not he!— My brother, and your brother, being mine! Œd. Yet brother against brother, son 'gainst sire, Such things have been between them, and shall be, For things of less ambition than a throne. Ioc. Oh, strangle such suspicion in its birth Of one more innocent than babe unborn! Why, had he minded empire, could he not Have seized it for his own before you came, And Thebes was looking for a sovereign? Or, after-minded to unseat you King, Would have contrived and hatch'd his priestly plot Ere you so firmly seated on the throne, And life with him at least so much for-spent As makes ev'n just possession—and much more, Unjust—of little moment unto all! Œd. So be it. From the God of Light and Truth Less likely than from him of Sleep and Dream, Whose-ever be the Prophet. Ioc. Had you not Provoked the Prophet first? Œd. As who would not, Who either knowing would withhold the word On which a people's whole salvation hung, Then, taunted into malice by just wrath, Or to collusion with some traitor leagued, Belied his God, and me. Ioc. The man is old, And testy, and perhaps incensed by you, Mere human passion with the lees Of Divination mixing— Œd. Be it so; And so, methinks, I might have let it pass, But for a parting threat, which though in wrath And malice, like the rest it may have been, Woke up the echo of another Word Told me by Delphi's self, so long ago As with its unfulfilment to have died Almost from memory. Ioc. What Oracle Which, if the Prophet fail'd, has fail'd as well? Œd. You know I am the son of Polybus, Of Corinth King, and Merope his Queen, And till a chance, of which you may not know, Slight as it seem'd, but fraught with grave result, Methought the first in Corinth after them. One day at table, when the cup went round, One of the company whom I, belike Flushed with the wine and youthful insolence, Had twitted with his meaner parentage, Bade me beware; for, proudly as I sate Above them all beside the royal twain A superstition linger'd, that because Of some ill-omen'd accident of birth Their son should never to their throne succeed. The word awhile sank in the flowing wine, But when the wine went off the word was there, And all night long kept stirring in my brain. So that, with morning when I woke again, Unable to endure it unsuppress'd, I challenged King and Queen to answer me The challenge thrown out by the nameless guest. Indignantly they heard; denounced the man Whoever it might be, for false or fool, And with endearing re-assurances Recomforted me awhile. Nevertheless, Spite re-assurance and redoubled love, That random word still rankled in my heart, And I resolved on quenching all misdoubt From the head fountain of all truth at Delphi. Thither, without a word of whither gone, I went, and put my question. But the God Vouchsafed no revelation of the past, But prophesied far worse for me to come; That I should slay my father: then with her Who bore me wed, and bring into the world A race the world would loathe to look upon. Whereat affrighted—as what man were not?— From Corinth and from those I was to wrong I fled—I scarce knew whither, so from them— Fled hither; and in spite of prophecies, All that I lost regain'd, except the bliss Of prospering in a loving mother's eyes. Ioc. And see! the father whom you were to slay, With that Queen-mother whom you were to wed, Lives to a ripe old age in Corinth, far Beyond his reach who should have wrong'd them both, Himself fast wedded and enthroned in Thebes! Œd. And yet this blunted shaft of long ago, And rusted with oblivion, had the Seer Snatch'd from his Master's armoury To-day, For malediction's last and master blow! Ioc. Which from his Master's hand had fail'd before! And would you listen to a woman's voice I could requite your story, Œdipus, With one so like as almost to be one, Save that in mine the Sire it was who foil'd Predestination, as in yours the Son. Œd. In this dumb pause between despair and hope, Whose voice to me more welcome than your own? Ioc. When first I wedded with King Laius, Whose murder now perplexes Thebes and you, A Prophecy from Delphi reached his ears— But whether from the God, or from his Priest, I know not—but there went the Prophecy; That he should die slain by the hand of him Who should be born between himself and me. Whereat, like you, affrighted, when the child But three days born had seen the light of day, He had him, spite of all a mother's cries, Not slain, but left in some such desert place As where with cold and hunger, he must die. So, at the sacrifice of that poor life Saving his own, he lived himself in peace, Till slain, not as the Oracle foretold Slain by the son himself had slain before, But by that undetected alien hand Which the fond Prophet pointed at in you. Of such account are such vaticinations, Whether from Phœbus, or his Minister; Of which take you no heed. For, surely, what Fate has determined, Fate shall bring to pass, Whether by prophecy foretold or not. Œd. So seems it. Ioc. Nay, beyond denial is. And yet you seem to hesitate as one Who in broad daylight cannot see his way. Œd. Was it not said that Laius your King Upon some sacred errand by the road Was set upon and murder'd? Ioc. Even so; To that same Delphi where yourself had been, As much to be misled. Œd. And whereabout? Ioc. Somewhere in Phocis which his road went through; As went the story. Œd. And how long ago? Ioc. Nay, just before you came to Thebes yourself To save us from the Sphinx, and occupy The throne left empty by my husband's death. What makes you muse? Œd. And this King Laius About what age, and what to look upon? Ioc. Lofty and large of stature, and of port And aspect that becomes a King; his hair Just whitening with the earliest frost of age— Œd. And how accompanied? Ioc. With such a train Accompanied as may become a King Upon a peaceful errand of his own, And through a friendly people travelling. Œd. And, as the story went, but one of those Who, witnessing, escaped to tell the tale. Ioc. Ev'n so it was. Œd. And him they let depart With half his tale untold? Ioc. Nay, all he could, Half dead with terror. Meanwhile Œdipus, What is't that, when I thought to clear your brow With dissipation of prophetic fear, Darkens it more and more? Œd. Is it not strange— Strange—that your second husband, like your first, With such a cross-related Prophecy Threaten'd, like him should have defeated it? Ioc. Strange as it is, but most assuredly. Œd. O Iocasta, what if secret Fate Avenged the God, who sometimes speaks for her, Two thwarted utterances by one blow On Laius and myself unprophesied? Ioc. I know not what this aims at. Œd. You shall hear. When, as I told you, in my youth at Corinth, I had resolved to cross that Prophecy Which from the God's own lips myself had heard, By flying those I was foredoom'd to wrong— Nay, from the very country of my birth, Leaving them all behind me for the stars Alone to tell me of their whereabout, I fled: and flying as at random on, I came—now mark me, Iocasta, came— Whether in Phocis, or elsewhere, I know not— Where two main roads which lead two nations on To Delphi, shrink into a narrow gorge; When, coming up the narrow road, Behold! A Herald first, and then a chariot, In which, erect beside his charioteer, There rode the stately semblance of a King, And so came on, not swerving left or right, As if the road were but for them, and I A cur, to slink aside and let them by. Whereat, no cur, but a King's son, enraged, With the stout staff I carried in my hand I smote the charioteer; on which the King Struck me with his—for which he paid too dear With such a fatal counter-blow from mine As roll'd him headlong dead into the dust: And, after him, his Herald, and all his Who came against me one by one I slew. Now if the royal man—for such he was— Were—as by such consent of circumstance I scarce dare think were not— Ioc. Oh, many a King Of a like presence, and like retinue, Has been that road to learn the word of Fate Which he, like you, had vainly learn'd before. Œd. But one escaped, they say; and if he live— And if maintain the tale that first he told, That Laius, not by one, but many men, Was in his chariot set upon and slain, Then was it surely not King Laius Whom single-handed, and alone, I slew. But if he falter from that first report— Ioc. How should he? Œd. Whether out of present fear, Or after, to excuse a coward flight, One man to numbers multiply he might— Ioc. He cannot—whether by device or fear, He cannot falter from his first report— Unless the sudden presence of his King, And the disquiet of your looks affright him Into the confirmation of false fear. But meanwhile, Œdipus, come in with me, And let not troubled Thebes new troubles see Writ in your brows, augmenting present ill, And Prophecy that Fate shall not fulfil. Chorus. Strophe 1. Fair Fortune deign with me to dwell, My soul if holy reverence awes, By thinking, speaking, acting well, To bow obedient to the Laws. From heav'n they draw their lineage high, And tread with stately step the sky: Their father the Olympian king; No mixture of man's mortal mould; Nor shall Oblivion's sable wing In shades their active virtues fold. In them the god is great, nor fears The withering waste of years. Antistrophe 1. The tyrant Pride engenders. Pride With wealth o'erfill'd, with greatness vain, Mounting with Outrage at her side, The splendid summit if she gain, Falls headlong from the dangerous brow, Down dash'd to ruin's gulf below. Not so our monarch: for of old, His contest glorious to the state, In her own blood the Fury roll'd: So may the god now guide his fate! Still be the god's protection mine, Strong in his power divine! Strophe 2. But should some wretch, contemptuous, bold, Brave the just gods, his hands with slaughter stain, The vengeful pow'rs of heav'n disdain, Nor their pure seats in holy reverence hold, Him may Perdition sweep away, And thus his wanton pride repay; Him too, whom wild Ambition prompts to seize, Though Justice cries aloud, forbear. Can all his vaunts, who dares attempts like these, Guard his proud heart from guilty fear? Such deeds if glory waits, in vain I lead this choral train. Antistrophe 2. No more at Delphi's central cell, At Abæ, or Olympia's hallow'd shrine, Attendant pay I rites divine, Till the god deigns this darkness to dispel. O Jove, if thee we rightly call The sovereign lord, the king of all, Let not concealment this in shades enfold From thee, and thy immortal reign! The oracles, to Laius giv'n of old, They spurn with insolent disdain, No more to Phœbus honours pay; And things divine decay. Iocasta, Chorus. Ioc. Ancients of Thebes, in this extremity When ev'n the very steersman of the realm, To whom we look for our deliverance, Veering himself with every wind that blows Of rumour, helplessly resigns the helm, I come, albeit with these poor woman's hands, To offer wreath and incense on the shrines And altars of our tutelary Gods: And first to thee, Apollo, first to thee, Whose altar nearest to the palace stands, And on whose word depends the life of Thebes, Lest any unconsider'd word against Thy Minister, revolt thy face from us; Imploring thee with all the Gods in Heav'n To help where all of human help is vain. Chorus Barb'd with Death, there are among The gold-enquiver'd arrows hung About Apollo's shoulder; whence, As over heav'n his chariot burns The land he loves to harvest turns, And cities swell with opulence; Ev'n so, where yet unexpiated sin Cries out, or undetected lurks within, The God his lustre turns to pestilence; And contrite man must worship and abide, Till, Nemesis and Justice satisfied, When men least dream it, one relenting ray— Oh grant, Apollo, grant it as we pray!— Strikes through sheer midnight, and lets in the day. Herald, Iocasta, Chorus. Her. Tell me who will among you, men of Thebes, Which is the palace of King Œdipus, And, further, if the King himself within. Cho. This is the palace; and the King himself Within; and she that by that altar stands Offering her garland to the God, his Queen. Her. Oh, to the prayer she offers at the shrine She lays the wreath on, be the God benign! Ioc. A Herald! whence, and on what embassy? Her. From Corinth, as the message that I bring. Ioc. Good may the tidings be where all goes ill. Her. If, as things human, not unmix'd with pain, To you and yours auspicious in the main. Ioc. So far so well; but tell me— Her. This in sum— The citizens of Corinth, by my voice, Proclaim King Œdipus of Thebes their King Ioc. Œdipus King of Corinth? Her. Even so. Ioc. But does not Polybus in Corinth reign? Her. No; the long years that kept him on the Throne, At length have laid him in his father's tomb. Ioc. The King of Corinth dead! Polybus dead! Summon the King! You Oracles of Heaven, Of what account shall men hereafter hold Your Ministers—or you? This was the Sire Whom Œdipus, for fear of slaying, fled, Now by the common course of Nature dead! Œdipus, Iocasta, Herald, Chorus. Œd. What tidings? Is the man I sent for here? Ioc. Not he, but one whose coming shall go far To make his coming needless. Herald, speak. Her. I come from Corinth, by the people there Charged with a mission to King Œdipus, Whom, in the room of Polybus now dead, They call upon to fill the sovereign chair. Œd. My father dead? Ioc. And by no hand of yours! Her. No, nor by any hand but Nature's own, That lightly rocks, you know, old age to sleep. Œd. And this is he whom by the Oracle From Phœbus his own lips, myself I heard Foredoom'd to slay— Yet with whose death I have no more to do Than leaving him to languish for the son Whose hand was to have slain him had he stay'd! Ioc. Did not I say? Œd. But who would not be scared By such prediction from the God himself— Of which yet half hangs dark above my head! Ioc. This word from Corinth is a Signal-fire Assuring us that Oracle, half slain, Must all lie buried in your father's tomb. Œd. The agèd King is dead, you tell me, Herald— But Merope, his Queen? Her. Lives, and may live As one that hath not reached her winter yet; And longer yet to live if you return, Whose sudden flight from Corinth neither she Nor Corinth cease to wonder at, and mourn. Œd. Yet, Herald, she herself it was whose love, That would have held me there, thence banish'd me. Her. If one, a simple subject as I am, Might ask of him he now salutes for King— Œd. A Prophecy of Phœbus, from the lips Of Phœbus' self, and utter'd in these ears, Involving me in worse calamity With Merope, my mother, who survives, Than by my father's death I have escaped. Her. I understand not wholly, but thus much, That 'twas the fear of some mysterious wrong Against them both which drove you from their side And from your country. Œd. That, and that alone. Her. I know not if for better or for worse, But certainly for strangest, Œdipus, If now for the first time, and from my lips, You learn that you are not indeed the son Of those you fled from in what two-fold fear. Œd. You seem a loyal as well-season'd man, As near in age to him you lately served As trusted, and I think to me and mine Well-minded now. Her. If not, I had not told What told I have. Œd. And would reiterate? Her. By the most solemn oath by which mankind Adjure the Gods to witness human word. Œd. That I am not in very deed the son Of Polybus, and Merope his Queen? Her. No more their son than—might I so dare say— Than son of mine—and that is, not at all. Œd. But was this known in Corinth? Her. To none else Save to the King and Queen themselves, and me. Œd. Yet 'twas in Corinth when the cup went round At table, that a guest once startled me With a light taunt of somewhat like to that Which now you gravely tell. Her. The random shot Of idleness, or malice freed by wine, That sometimes nears the mark. Œd. But how was it That only you beside the King and Queen Knew for a truth? Her. Would Œdipus know all? Œd. Yea—on the allegiance you profess to him, Whom now you have saluted as your King. Her. Thus then I know it: for that I alone Laid you a new-born babe into their hands Who, childless as they were, and like to be, Ev'n took what fortune sent them for their own. Cho. This man bears stranger tidings from himself Than from his country he was charged withal. Œd. You—and you solely—brought me to their hands— From whose received me then? Ioc. O Œdipus, When all, beyond all hope, has ended well, Why tempt the God, still jealous of success, By questioning the means? Œd. I bid you speak! Her. You charge me for an answer, Œdipus, Which, were you not my King who bids me speak, Yet might resent when spoken— Œd. But one word Of ev'n unwelcome truth from human lip Were welcome in the night of mystery That Fate has gather'd round me. Her. Listen, then. Long ere in favour of these whitening locks, And recompence of faithful service done, King Polybus had made me what I am, I was his shepherd; and, upon a time Keeping my flock upon Kithæron's side, One of like calling with myself, though not Of the same country, who that summer through Had fed his sheep beside me, came one day, And listening first, and looking all about, With those rough hands of his he laid in mine As tenderly as any mother might, A naked infant—say, some three days born— And fasten'd foot to foot, like some poor lamb, Which some one of the land from which he came, Warm from the bosom of its mother took To perish on the barren mountain's side, Of cold and hunger. Which the kindly man Not finding in himself the heart to do, But yet as fearful if he left undone, Gave you—for you, King Œdipus, it was— The very name you bear, remembering The pitiful condition of the babe— Gave you to me, to carry far away And pitifully cherish for my own Beyond all search of those who wish'd you dead. So to his country he, and I to mine: Which when I reach'd, and to my King and Queen Show'd them the prettiest lamb of all my flock, They, whether by some instinct of their own Inspired, or somewhat royal in the Child Prophetic of the Man that was to be, Took, nursed, and rear'd to manhood for their own, And set beside themselves upon the throne. Cho. The Gods upon the mountain-top, men tell, Do sometimes light, and through the tangled dell, And forest-shade— Œd. A shepherd like yourself, But not of Corinth. Whence then? Her. Thebes, he said, To which your destiny recall'd you. Œd. Thebes! Ioc. O Œdipus, by all the Gods in heav'n, And all that upon earth you hold most dear, Heed not these stories of the past, patch'd up By the fallacious memory of old age! Œd. He were by nature baser than base-born Who would not find and follow to its source The current of the blood by which he lives. This Shepherd—and from whom took he the child— Charged with that ruthless errand? Her. Either I With mine own duty busied did not ask, Or he not answer. Œd. But to answer lives? Her. Those of his country best can answer that. Œd. Does any man of all the people here Remember such a man? Cho. May be the same Already sent for, who, as I remember, Like this good Herald, shepherded the flocks Of Laius, then our Master. But the Queen— Ioc. No more! No more! For your sake, Œdipus, If not for mine—no more! Œd. Whatever shame My birth betray, your blood it cannot taint; Not were I proved the issue of a sire Three generations deep in slavery. Ioc. Forbear! once more, for one last time, forbear! Œd. If aught you know—and your wild looks and words But argue somewhat than conjecture worse— At once reveal it all: for ask I will Till all be answered. Ioc. Wretched man! the last These lips shall ever utter you have heard! Cho. She is gone as one distracted. O my Lord, What should this sudden passion of the Queen Forbode of ill! Œd. Forbode what ill it may, But I will solve the riddle of my birth. The Queen belike, of royal birth herself And haughty-minded as such women are, Resents her husband's baser parentage; But I, regardless of the accident That oft from royal blood provokes a slave, I do account myself the royal heir Of Destiny, who found me where I lay, By man's blind foresight which defeats itself Cradled to perish on Kithæron's side, And taking from a simple shepherd's hand, So laid me in the lap of Royalty, And through the days and years of human growth Rear'd to the kingly stature that I am. And when, affrighted by vain prophecies, From Corinth, and the throne prepared me there, I fled, inalienable Destiny Pursuing drove me but from throne to throne, Till, doubling back my course to reach my height, Now Thebes and Corinth claim me for their own. Chorus. Strophe. If a prophet's soul be mine Aught illumed with skill divine, By Olympus' sacred height, Ere the morning's streaming light, Thou, Kithæron, shalt unfold All this mystery round thee roll'd, And with pride and triumph own Œdipus thy foster'd son. Then with joy would we advance, Leading light the festive dance; Teach thy woods with joy to ring, And with transport hail our king. Glorious with thy silver bow Phœbus, these our joys allow! Antistrophe. Who, of all the heav'nly pow'rs, Gave thee birth in these close bow'rs? Some bright Nymph of sylvan race Did the frolic Pan embrace, Wand'ring o'er the mountain's brow? Or to Phœbus dost thou owe Thy birth? For him the craggy height, Him the pastured dales delight. Or to him, the god who roves Through Cyllene's cypress groves? Or did Bacchus, wont to tread His loved haunt, the mountain's head, Thee receive, confess'd his son, From the Nymphs of Helicon? Raptured with their tuneful strain Sportive oft he joins their train. Œdipus, Shepherd, Herald, Chorus. Œd. Whether or not the man we have so long Been looking after, one at least whose age Evens with his whose story we have heard. Cho. Whether the same of whom the stranger tells I know not, but the man himself I know For an old shepherd of King Laius. Her. And I for him with whom I shepherded Upon Kithæron's side so long ago. Œd. Approach, old man—still nearer—unafraid; For nothing but my favour need you fear, If, looking straight at me, as I at you, Straightforwardly you answer what I ask. You, in the days gone by, and long ere Time Had strewn his silver honour on your head— You were a servant of King Laius? Shep. His servant—not his slave—no less than he, Myself a freeman of the soil of Thebes. Œd. As such I understand; and in that wise, As a free servant of King Laius, You kept his flocks? Shep. Upon a time I might. Œd. And folding them at home in winter-time, Led them in Summer forth? Shep. So shepherds use, Where'er the more and sweeter pasture grew. Œd. And ever on Kithæron's grassy sides In summer-time, remember you this man, Old as yourself, keeping his flock with yours? Shep. Time that has silver'd, as you say, my locks, Has somewhat dimm'd both eyes and memory. Œd. None older than your fellow-shepherd here, Who with his locks as silver-touch'd as yours, Sees, and recalls in you the man of yore. Shep. May be; but all men are not all alike, And he may err as well remembering me, As I forgetting him. Her. Listen to me, And let my voice, and what it has to tell, Recall to you the man your eyes do not. Can you not call to mind, though long ago, Keeping your flock with one whose flock, like yours, Grazed on Kithæron, one long summer through— Shep. With more than one, may be. Her. Nay, but with one To whom, just as that same long summer closed, And cold Arcturus warn'd the shepherd home, You brought a naked infant— Shep. Brought? who brought? Her. Tied by the feet— Shep. What should one know of that? Her. Being myself the man you gave it to. Shep. Methinks this man, whoever he may be, And howsoever gifted with good eyes, Is something weaker in his wits than I, Recounting all such idle rhapsody. Œd. And you, sharp-witted as you are, methinks Seem looking round about you for escape In hesitation—but escape shall not. Look you! Beware! Shep. What have I said amiss? Œd. Not said, but will not say. Shep. What would you have? Œd. The babe your fellow-shepherd asks about— That naked, new-born, ankle-fetter'd babe, Did not you bring and put into his hands? Shep. And would to Heaven had died before I did! Œd. And death you shall not have to pray for long, If, knowing what prevarication proves You know, you not reveal. Shep. And if reveal! Have you not heard enough? Œd. No, if not all. The babe you put into this shepherd's hands Was not your own? Shep. Oh, not mine own! Œd. Then whose? Shep. O Œdipus, my master, and my lord! In mercy question me no more! Œd. No more In mercy if you answer not at once. Shep. O me! The terror of your countenance Scatters what little memory age has left! What if I found the little helpless thing There laid alone and none to tell me whose? Or he from whom I took it knew no more Than he to whom I gave it? Œd. Bind his hands: The lash must loose the tongue. Shep. O Œdipus, Shame not white hairs! Œd. Nay, shame them not yourself By false prevarication with your King. That helpless babe—me—Œdipus—your King— Who gave into your hands? Shep. Alas! alas! One of the household of the King that was!— Œd. Slave? Servant? Who? Shep. Alas! one now within Can answer all! Œd. Answer yourself then, who? Shep. Woe's me! I drift into destruction's mouth! Œd. And I with you. But who? Shep. Alas! The Queen! Œd. The Queen! Shep. Ev'n Iocasta's sacred self! Œd. But not her own? Shep. I said not that— Œd. Her own? Shep. Yourself have said. Cho. The man is turn'd to stone! [After a silence.] Œd. The God of Delphi has revenged himself! His oracle defied of long ago, And his insulted prophet's of to-day, Break in one judgment o'er my head, who now, Myself sole witness and interpreter, Divine that half reveal'd is all fulfill'd, In the original, if I mistake not, Œdipus convicts himself of murdering his Father without asking the Evidence of the Witness he had sent for. And on myself myself pronounce my doom. Cho. O Œdipus, my lord— Œd. Speak to me not, Approach me not, unless at once to slay, Or thrust with execration from the walls, The wretch convicted of the double crime Of parricide, and—Ha! the prophet said That, ere the Day which all beholds go down, I shall have look'd my last upon the Sun Which all accomplishes—and, ere we pass To darkness, somewhat yet is to be done. Chorus. Strophe. Ye race of mortals, what your state? Life I an airy nothing deem. For what, ah! what your happiest fate, More than light fancy's high-wrought dream? How soon those baseless dreams decay, And all the glittering visions melt away! Whilst thy example, hapless king, Thy life, thy fortune I bewail, Happy no man of mortal birth I hail. Thine was no vulgar fate: its tow'ring wing To wealth, and empire's splendid summit soar'd: When, silenced her mysterious lore, The harpy-talon'd monster scream'd no more, Our bulwark thou against that pest abhorr'd, Thebes gave her sceptre to thy honour'd hand, And hail'd thee monarch of a mighty land. Antistrophe. Who now is pierced with keener pain? To all thy glories bid farewell: They fly, and in their stead a train Of miseries crowd with thee to dwell. To one great port, illustrious king, Their gallant barks the son and father bring; But sink in wild waves roaring round. How could thy father's bed so long, Ah, how in silence bear the horrid wrong! But thee th' all-seeing eye of time hath found, And these unhallow'd rites abhorrent shows. Oh son of Laius, ne'er again, Ne'er could my sorrowing heart thy sight sustain: Yet I lament in mournful strains thy woes, By thee 'twas mine to life, to light, to rise; By thee in dark despair to close my eyes. Messenger, Chorus. Mess. O venerable Senators of Thebes, O liege-men of the house of Labdacus, What shall you hear—what not behold—of such Pollution in the Palace of your Kings, Which all the waters in one volume drown'd Of Nile and Ister could not wash away! Cho. What we already have beheld and heard Were but prophetic of yet worse to come; Tell us the worst. Mess. If breath I have to tell, If not the worst, the worse that first befell. The light of Iocasta's life is quench'd! Cho. Alas, not strange as terrible! But how? Mess. By her own hand; as by my eyes indeed I cannot, but from others can, avouch, With such bewilder'd senses as I may— When, as you witness'd for yourselves, from hence She fled, and flew distractedly within, Shrieking, and tearing her grey locks, she ran Along the echoing walls until she reach'd The nuptial chamber, shot the bolt within, And by the affrighted women lock'd without Was heard calling on ‘Laius, Laius! Her husband Laius, father of the Son Who slew, and worse dishonour'd him when dead!’ This, and much more, and much more terrible, They heard: and then a silence as of death, Through all the house; till with the sudden yell As of some wild beast closing on his prey, King Œdipus along the corridor With imprecations half articulate, Fearful to hear—too fearful to relate— With thrice the force of the mad Herakles He flung himself against the chamber-door, And bursting in, to all who dared to look Disclosed the wretched woman hanging dead. Whom when he saw, roaring, he sprang upon, And tearing from the beam flung down aheap, And spurn'd; and then, most horrible of all, Wide open tore the raiment from her breast, From which himself recoiling with a shriek, He struck the golden clasp into his eyes, Which having seen such things, henceforth, he said, Should in the light of Day behold no more Those whom he loved, nor, in the after-dark Of Hades, those he loathed, to look upon. Then rising, blind, and bleeding as he was, He groped and stagger'd back the way he came, Vociferating as he went along That none who would not share the curse with him Should touch unless to slay him—till he reach'd The palace-door, and would, methinks, have that, As of the nuptial chamber, open burst, Had not King Creon bid them lead him in Where none henceforth should hear, and none behold, Till Thebes his fate determine.—All is told. Chorus. Oh men of Thebes, this famous man behold, Who coming here a stranger to the gate, The Sphinx's fatal riddle did unfold, And chosen King, as Saviour of the State So greatly ruled, and rose to such Renown As not a King but envied: now by Fate To such a Depth precipitated down As not a Wretch but may commiserate. Beholding which, and counsell'd by the wise, That Nemesis regards with jealous eyes Man's over-much, and at his elbow stands To shake the full cup in the steadiest hands, Deem not the wisest of To-morrow sure, Nor fortunate account him till he dies.</field>
