      <field name="fulltext">ŒDIPUS AT ATHENS PART II Œdipus, Antigone Œd. The dawn which breaks not on my sightless eyes Salutes my forehead with reviving warmth: Here let us rest awhile, Antigone, From this brief travel stol'n by fear from night. But know you whither it hath led us, and Among what strangers, who from charity Shall with sufficient for the day provide For one with less than little satisfied? Ant. I know from one who cross'd us in the dusk, With steps as hurried as our own, the land Is Attica. Œd. Ay, I remember now. Ant. And not far off I see the shining walls And marble temple-fronts, and citadel, As of some stately city: and the place We stand on, as for some peculiar use Sequester'd from the daily track of men, Where a pure rill of water rambles through Untrampled herbage, overshaded all With laurel, and with olive, poplar-topt, As you may guess from many a nightingale About us warbling, well assured of home. Œd. And might not, haply, some poor hunted thing, With but a sorry burden for his song, Here, too, some breathing-while of refuge find? Ant. And in good time comes of the country one Who shall advise us, lest, as strangers here, We trespass on the usages of those To whom we look for shelter and support. Enter an Athenian. O stranger— Ath. Hush! Before another word— Where ev'n a word unlawful—how much more With the soil'd foot of Travel trespassing On consecrated ground! Œd. I yet dare ask Whether to Deity, or Demigod, Thus consecrate? Ath. To Deity, and such As least of all will Men's intrusion brook Within their hallow'd precincts. Œd. Who be they? Ath. None other but those awful Sisters Three, Daughters of Earth and Darkness. Œd. By what name Invoked of men? Ath. By whatsoever name Elsewhere invoked, here, with averted eyes, And with an inward whisper—‘The Benign.’ Œd. Benign then, as their name and nature is To those who suffer and who do no wrong, May they receive the sightless suppliant, who, By no false Insight, howbeit unaware, Within their Sanctuary first setting foot, Alive shall never leave it but to die. Ath. Your words I understand not; but I know, Whether to live or die, depart you must. Œd. But what, if rather fearing unjust Man Than the just God, and those same awful Three, If stern to guilt, not unbenign to me, I leave their hallow'd refuge? Ath. Nay, for that The land itself is dedicated all To God or Demigod, who, Just themselves, Protect and vindicate the Just: for here Poseidon rules, the Master of the Seas, And there Prometheus, with his torch of Life; The ground about us glories in the name Of King Colonus of the Horse; and this Same highway running by the Sacred Grove Leads to the City and the Citadel Surnamed of Her who keeps them for her own. Œd. As such I do salute her!—And the King That, under her, her chosen people rules— Ath. Theseus, the son of Ægeus, and, like him, Though mortal yet, almost the Demigod. Œd. Theseus, the son of Ægeus,—ay, I know And know indeed that no delusive light Led me to him with whom I have to do. Shall one among your fellow-citizens Bear your King word from one who once was King, And who, unkinglike as his presence now, Can tell him that which, if he hearken to, Shall, for a little service done to me, Do to his kingdom and himself much more? Ath. Strange as the message from so strange a man, Yet shall King Theseus hear of it. Meanwhile, If in despite of warning and advice You still refuse to leave this holy ground, I, that am but a simple citizen, Dare not enforce; but forthwith shall apprize Those of the City who shall deal with you, As in their wisdom best they shall advise. Œdipus, Antigone. Œd. Is he departed? Ant. We are all alone. Œd. Daughters of Earth and Darkness! In whose womb Unborn till Sovereign Order the new World From Chaos woke, yourselves you still secrete, With those three Fatal Sisters who the thread Of Human Life do spin among the Dead, While you the scourge of human Wrong prepare; If peradventure with unlicensed feet The consecrated earth I have profaned, That veils your Presence from this upper air, Renounce me not: no, nor in me the God Who destined, nor the God who prophesied, That, after drifting the blind wreck I am About the world, a Horror to Mankind, Within the Temple of that Triple wrath That Nemesis unyoked to scourge me down, At last the haven of my rest should find; If satisfied at last be wrath Divine, And men err not who name its ministers, Though not without a shudder—‘The Benign,’ Let your avenging Justice, that so long Hath chased the guiltless instrument of Wrong, Here grant him rest until the Power whose throne You dwell beside in Darkness give the sign. Chorus, Œdipus, Antigone. Cho. These are the strangers—this the sightless man, And this the maiden that he told us of, Who impiously this consecrated ground Have ventured to profane. Œd. Not impiously, But ignorantly, who first setting foot Upon this alien soil— Cho. But impiously, When warn'd upon what consecrated ground, With honey-flowing waters running through The inviolable herbage still persist— A stranger too, where no Athenian born, Not only dares not enter, but pass by Save with averted eyes, and inward prayer, That holy lips scarce dare articulate. Ant. We must obey them, Father, as we should, Œd. You will not, if I quit the Sanctuary, Do, nor let others do me violence? Cho. Fear not the wrath of men, but that of those Who watch you through the soil which you profane. Œd. But who, if of their counsel more you knew, As sooner than you look for know you may, Would not resent, as you, the wrong I do them. Meanwhile, on no worse usage than from them Relying when committed to your hands— Lead me, Antigone. Cho. Till you have pass'd The bound of sequestration—further yet— And yet a little further—so, enough. There, travel-wearied, and, perchance, in years Well stricken, rest upon the bank awhile. But, ere I bid you welcome to the land Whose sanctity your foot at first profaned, Tell who you are, and whence. Œd. To tell you ‘Who’ Would tell you all: and if I hesitate— Cho. Not to declare your country and your name Augurs but evil for yourself or it. Œd. You of that City have heard tell, whose walls To Music rose, and whose Inhabitants, From the sown Dragon's teeth sprung up arm'd men? Cho. Of Thebes? Ay, much of olden times, and of The worse than Dragon Sphinx that in our day The Dragon seed devour'd. Œd. And of the man Who slew that worse than Dragon— Cho. Œdipus! As by the signal of those sightless eyes, And lingering self-avowal, I divine— Œd. Revolt not from me. Cho. And for You! for You— May be, the monster most unnatural— To set your foot upon the holiest spot Of this all-consecrated Athens! You! Who, were your very presence not enow Contamination to the land, and shame, May bring on us the plague you left at Thebes! I should not wrong a promise half implied If with these hands I tore you from the Land Your impious presence doubly violates, Where e'en the guiltless dare not enter—Hence! Begone! Pollute our land no more! Begone! Ant. O men of Athens! if you will not hear My Father pleading for himself, hear me, Not for myself, but for my Father pleading, As to a Father, by the love you bear The Daughter by yon Altar-hearth at home, And by the Gods we worship as yourselves. Cho. Daughter, the Gods whom you adjure us by, Repudiating Œdipus from Thebes, From Athens also do repudiate. Œd. O then of Fame that blows about the world The praise of men and nations, what the worth, If Athens—Athens, through the world renown'd For hospitable generosity— Athens, who boasts the power as much as will To save and succour the misfortunate— If she that honour forfeit at your hands, Who, from the very horror of my name, And shapeless rumour of the terrible things Which I have suffer'd, rather than have done, Would thrust me from the Sanctuary forth Of those whose law you violate no less By broken Faith, than with unwary foot Did I their consecrated soil transgress? One, too, that howsoe'er you know it not, Ev'n with the Ban that drives him from his own Carries a Blessing with him to the Land That shall accept him, and a Curse to those Who, being his, henceforth shall be their foes. All which, unto my inward eye as clear As yonder Sun that shines in Heav'n to yours, I shall reveal to him who governs here, If hearing he deny me not. Meanwhile, I do adjure you, by those Deities Whose Sanctuary you have drawn me from, Do me no violence; remembering That, if Benign they be, Avengers too, As of all outraged Law, so not the less Of violated hospitality. Cho. We have discharged ourselves in warning you, And to King Theseus, whom you summon'd here, Your cause and self henceforward we commit To deal with, and adjudge as seems him fit. Theseus, Œdipus, Antigone, Chorus Thes. I have been hither summon'd at the call Of one from whom, 'twas said, the light of Day Together with his Kingdom pass'd away: And, knowing of one such, and one alone, Reported in the roll of living men, Nor uninstructed in the destiny Which from the glory it had raised him to Precipitated to a depth so low, Amid the ruin of this fallen man I know that Œdipus of Thebes is he. I too remember when like him forlorn, I wandered friendless in a foreign land, And with an alien people much endured: And, had I always been what now I am, Yet none the less by what myself have known Than by the records of Mankind, aware That, howsoever great a King To-day, No surer of To-morrow than yourself; Therefore whatever Athens or her King Of hospitable service can supply, Let him demand: for much indeed it were For Œdipus to ask and me withhold. Œd. O Theseus, if indeed the King I was Look through the ruin of the wretch I am, No less doth full assurance of a King, Although to these quench'd eyes insensible, Breathe through the generous welcome of your word, And ere of my necessities I tell, Assure me of the boon as yet unask'd. For the detested story of my life, Unask'd, you know it—whence, and what I was, To what catastrophe reserved you see— Yet not so ignominious to myself, No, nor to Athens so unprofitable, Will you but listen, and do that for me, Which, howsoever strange from lips like mine, Is sure as Fate itself, as Fate it is. Thes. Doubt not, however strange, whether or not To Athens profitable, if to you, What Œdipus demands shall Theseus do. Œd. But profitable shall it be to both, Unless the Spokesman of Futurity From Delphi shall have prophesied a lie: For this unsightly remnant of a king— Though while it breathes a burden to us both, But when the breath is out of it, to be More serviceable to you than good looks— I do consign to you for sepulture Under the walls that, as they shelter'd me While living, after death will I defend. Thes. But of the life you have to live between This hour and that why take you no account? Œd. No; for the life between this hour and that In that sepulture is provided for. Thes. You ask an easy favour at my hands, Whether for life or death. Œd. Nevertheless, May be, to promise easier than to do. Thes. How so? Œd. Those loving friends of mine in Thebes, Who would not when I pray'd them, now, perforce, If not per-suasion, when myself would not, Will have me back with them. Thes. And what if Thebes, Relenting, or repenting, Œdipus— Œd. O, not repenting or relenting, Thebes, But by an Oracle of Phœbus scared, Which told them that unless they get me home, To live what Life they leave me, and, when dead, Lie tomb'd outside—outside, I say—their Gates They shall not thrive in war against the foe, Whose walls shall overshadow what they lose. As Thebes shall find should ever strife arise Between herself and Athens, if their King Vouchsafe me that which I have ask'd of him. Thes. But Thebes and Athens, friendly powers of old, What quarrel should arise to make them foes? Œd. O Son of Ægeus! to the Gods alone Belongs immunity from Change and Death: All else doth all controlling Time confound. Earth waxes old: and all that from her womb She brings to light upon her bosom dies, And all is mutability between. Ev'n so with Man, who never at one stay, No less in mind than body changeable, Likes what he liked not, loathes where once he loved, And then perchance to liking turns again. And as with man, with Nation none the less. If now with Thebes and Athens all look fair, Yet Time his furrow'd track of Night and Day Pursues, wherein some grain of Discord dropt, Perhaps no bigger than an idle word, That shall infect his kindly Brotherhood, And ripen'd Amity to rancour turn. As one day—for I prophesy—shall be, When my cold ashes underneath these walls Shall drink the warm blood of my enemies— Ev'n as they might upon this quarrel now, Had Thebes not other foe to deal withal. Thes. Rumour hath reach'd us of some warlike stir. But on what quarrel— Œd. Thebes against herself. For those two sons of mine, who for so long In the Egyptian fashion, as I thought, Kept house, and did the women's work within, Now, full adult in arrogance and pride, Assert their sex to quarrel for the throne From which they banish'd me: Eteocles The younger, with the subtle Creon's aid, Not only seizes first, but yet withholds The sceptre from his elder brother's hand; Who, as by sure intelligence I learn, Hath fled to Argos, and so cunningly Made good his cause, that King Adrastus there Gives him his daughter's hand in marriage, and Along with her, by way of royal dower, A host in arms that shall reconquer Thebes, And set my elder son upon—my Throne. And now by Phœbus' Oracle forewarn'd That Victory no less within my Tomb Shall live than in what now survives of me, And fearful now of what they wish'd before, Lest any day should find, where they might not, Their victim, less by years than by the load Of shame and woe they laid upon him, dead, They dog my steps like vultures on the track Of gathering battle, and the sharpest scent May even now be close upon my heels. Cho. Whether with Argos Thebes for war prepares, Behold a Herald, from whatever land I know not, as a messenger of Peace To Athens, with that Olive in his hand. Enter Herald from Thebes. Her. Creon of Thebes by mine his Herald's voice To Theseus, King of Athens, greeting sends, Craving from him due licence to confer With Œdipus, the King of Thebes that was, Now by report upon Athenian soil— Œd. Oh, I forefelt his coming in the wind!— Her. Until which licence granted by the King, With a small retinue he waits aloof Before advancing to the City's wall. Thes. Your King does well; and to his courtesy With a like greeting Athens shall reply. Œd. Oh, let no greeting made to him impeach What first vouchsafed to me! Thes. Fear not for that: The courtesy which courtesy returns No less leaves Œdipus sole arbiter To grant or to refuse what Thebes demands. Œd. If so, this Herald need not tarry long, Nor overtax his memory with the word That I shall freight him with. Thes. And yet methinks That e'en from lips he loves not Œdipus Might hear a word that should send up the scale Which now so down against his Country weighs. What once you heard, if when you heard it true May, by the changing Time and Circumstance Of which you tell me, now be Truth no more. Œd. More false than Creon Falsehood cannot be. O Theseus, one of heart and speech yourself, You know not what the double tongue can do. Thes. Nay, but the tongue which you so much distrust Will have to deal not with myself but you, Who know the man, and how to sift the word, As once of one more cunning than himself. And for all other argument than word, Myself and Athens are engaged for that. Œd. Be't so—vouchsafe but to be here yourself, As Witness and as Judge between us both, And you shall hear the Truth from those false lips Wrung out, which had been told you by the true, Had not that busy Herald interposed His olive leaf between yourself and me. Thes. Witness I may be, but of neither Judge In that which but concerns yourself and Thebes. But, whichsoever way the scale may turn, Not Judgment's self, save from the God's own lip, Against your will shall move you from my side. Meanwhile, within the City, Œdipus, With such observance as becomes myself With me abide this meeting. Œd. Ill beseems The mendicant demurring at the hand That but too generously deals with him. But the prophetic voice of Destiny, That led me hither, will not let me hence, Till he have giv'n the signal to be gone. Thes. Be't as you will; with these good men abide Secure, as in my promise, which I call The Power beside whose sacred grove we stand To witness, as I pledge it with my hand. Œd. Theseus, ere this the Gods whom you adjure Themselves had sworn by Fate the fore-decreed Requital of that generosity Which no requital looks for; and I know That even now, escaping through their hands, The Blessing strives to anticipate the Deed. Cho. But, that no evil influence thwart its way, And to propitiate that jealous Power Whose Sanctuary you at first profaned— You, Œdipus, and you, whose pious hand Leading him wrong, like expiation need— Returning to the consecrated shade Of one that in its inmost shadow dwells, Its dedicated Priest and Minister, The ceremonial he enjoins obey, First, by lustration in the sacred stream; Then to the sacred Earth, whereunder keep Those Three Benign ones ever on the watch, Thrice three libations from three vessels pour— Or honey mix'd with water, but no wine: Which when the forest-shaded Earth has supp'd, Upon her bosom olive wands thrice three Lay with a prayer within the lips suppress'd; And then, with unreverting eyes to us Returning, wait in confidence the rest. Chorus. Strophe 1. Well, stranger, to these rural seats Thou comest, this region's blest retreats, Where white Colonus lifts his head, And glories in the bounding steed. Where sadly sweet the frequent nightingale Impassion'd pours her evening song, And charms with varied notes each verdant vale, The ivy's dark-green boughs among; Or shelter'd 'midst the cluster'd vine, Which high above, to form a bow'r Safe from the sun or stormy show'r, Loves its thick branches to entwine; Where frolic Bacchus always roves, And visits with his fost'ring Nymphs the groves. Antistrophe 1. Bathed in the dew of heav'n each morn Fresh is the fair Narcissus born, Of these great pow'rs the crown of old: The Crocus glitters robed in gold. Here restless fountains ever murm'ring glide, And as their crisped streamlets stray To feed, Cephisus, thy unfailing tide, Fresh verdure marks their winding way; And as their pure streams roll along O'er the rich bosom of the ground, Quick spring the plants, the flow'rs around. Here oft to raise the tuneful song The virgin band of Muses deigns; And car-borne Venus guides her golden reins. Strophe 2. What nor rich Asia's wide domain, Nor all that sea-encircled land From Doric Pelops named, contain, Here, unrequired the cult'ring hand, The hallow'd plant spontaneous grows, Striking cold terror through our foes. Here blooms, this favour'd region round, The fertile Olive's hoary head; The young, the old behold it spread, Nor dare with impious hand to wound: For Morian Jove with guardian care Delights to see it flourish fair; And Pallas, fav'ring, from the skies Rolls the blue lustre of her eyes. Antistrophe 2. My voice yet once more let me raise, Yet other glories to relate: A potent god for these we praise, His presents to this favour'd state; The Steed obedient to the rein, And safe to plough the subject main. Our highest vaunt is this, thy grace, Saturnian Neptune, we behold The ruling curb emboss'd with gold Control the courser's managed pace. Though loud, O King, thy billows roar, Our strong hands grasp the well-form'd oar; And, while the Nereids round it play, Light cuts our bounding bark its way. Theseus, Œdipus, Creon, Antigone, Chorus. Thes. Son of Menœceus, of the realm of Thebes, A Ruler, and its Representative; Your peaceful advent by your Herald's voice Duly proclaim'd as much from me demands Of courteous welcome and acknowledgment. The purport of your mission to this Land Yourself have told me, as foretold by him, Who, till to-day a stranger like yourself, And by no Herald like yourself announced, Yet once a King, is still a King to me. And at his bidding am I present now, Not as a Judge between you to decide A question that concerns yourselves alone, But to hear that which, though he needs it not, Should justify that honour at my hands Which his ill Fate has forfeited in Thebes; And as a King in Athens to remain, If by persuasion or just argument You fail to move him ev'n to reign with you. Cre. O Theseus, Son of Ægeus, and still more Than Ægeus' self about the world proclaim'd, Slayer of the fiery-breathing Minotaur, And hordes of Men than one such monster worse: The Monarch of a State, if any in Greece, In men and means abounding, of the Gods Observant, and of Justice to Mankind, With your world-famous Areopagus, No less for Wisdom than for Arms renown'd, Like Her whose tutelary name you boast. On what a peaceful mission I am come, My Herald first, and the small retinue That follows me, sufficiently declare: To trespass not on foreign Land or Law— No, nor on his who, having found his way, Hath found a home on this Athenian soil; But whom, with what fair argument I may Of Kindred and of Country, I would fain, However royally entreated here, Persuade with me back to his home again. Cho. You know the man, though, haply, not the man He was, whom now you are to deal withal. Cre. Therefore to him will I address myself, In words as few and unrhetorical As simple Truth needs to be clothed withal In summing a momentous question up: Praying the Goddess underneath whose shade We here are standing to direct them home. O Œdipus! my Brother—once my King— And King once more to be, will you but hear What for myself, and with me Thebes, I speak; Sore wearied both under this long divorce From one that once the Saviour was of all, Under a judgment which your evil Fate Prepared, yourself invoked on your own head, And Thebes must execute if Thebes would live. But as no judgment wrought by human hand, And most to him that suffers from the blow, But of the shaking hand that dealt it tells— What of misdeed, or of misfortune what, Suffer'd or done—unwittingly by you Done, and by Thebes unwillingly redress'd— Behold at last, by Fate's accomplishment, The Oracles of Phœbus justified, The Gods by expiation of the Curse Appeased, and Thebes once more herself again, Like one recover'd from a mortal throe, And fain to fold him to her heart once more Who saved her once, and yet a second time Who sacrificed himself that she might live; Your Country reaches out beseeching arms, Land over land, until she finds you here, Among a People, with a King alike In hospitality renown'd as arms, But, welcome and entreat you as they may, Who cannot be to you, nor you to them, As Œdipus to Thebes, or Thebes to him. Wherefore I do beseech you, Œdipus, By all the ties that man to man endear Of kindred and of country; by all those That King to People bind, as them to him: Yea, by the God, who, for a secret end That Man not fathoms, having parted them, Now, reconciled himself, would reconcile; Be all that erring Man on either side Hath done amiss forgotten as forgiv'n, And Œdipus and Thebes as one again. Look! I, more burden'd than yourself by years; And, little as you think it, like yourself Bow'd down with execution of the Doom Whereunder you now labour self-condemn'd, With long and weary travel have I come, Half fearful of less prosperous return, Imploring you, if I cannot persuade With argument that shall commend itself, If not to you, to those you trust in here, Yet in the eyes of Athens shame me not By sending empty-handed back to Thebes. Cho. The Man has spoken: and to us it seems In well-consider'd word, King Œdipus, And temper that invites a like reply. Œd. Temper and word so well consider'd, friends, That, unaccustom'd as I long have been To civil greeting till I lighted here, And haply not the man I was to guess The well-consider'd word—But thus it runs: That, satisfied at length with all the shame And beggary Thebes condemn'd and left me to, To expiate the crime— Cre. I said not that— Œd. On which just Judgment done—though, by the way, Granting the Judgment just, I yet might ask If you, my kinsman, and those sons of mine, Must needs become its executioner? Cre. To Greece do I appeal if you yourself On your own head drew not the Judgment down Which Fate decreed and Phœbus prophesied, And upon which the People's Being hung; And which who but the People's Magistrate, Kinsman or other, needs must execute? Œd. By setting on the rabble pack of Thebes To yelp me through the gates? But let that pass: For now the rabble pack, to make amends, Send those who set them on to hunt me back. Cre. If you will have it so, so must it be: So but to good result on either side. Œd. Yet somewhat late amends on yours, I think, Whether by People or by Magistrate: Who, when the Plague by ceasing long ago Proved Expiation duly made by me, And I myself, worn with the load of shame I bore about with me among strange men, Cried out to lay my weary burden down— Were't with my life—among mine own once more, Then would you not to my entreaty grant What, unbesought, you come beseeching now. Cre. The People, panic-stricken with the storm That, having made such havoc in their ranks, Had scarcely pass'd, still dreaded its return. Œd. And prithee, Creon, how recomforted, And to my presence reconciled at last? Cre. The Magistrates whom you so much distrust, Adding the voice of their authority To theirs who by their sacred ministry The will of Heaven divine— Œd. Teiresias still! Whose refluent years against the base itself Of Delphi breaking shiver out of sight? Ay, he it was who with its breath surcharged, First trumpeted me forth; and now perhaps, When other Augury and Omen fail'd People and Magistrate to reassure, By some new summons from the Delphian shrine, Hath quicken'd Thebes to reconciliation By something stronger than regretful Love. Cre. What mean you, Œdipus? Œd. No more but this; That, as I wander'd—not so long ago— About the world begging my daily bread, A little wind from Delphi wandering too Came up with me, and whisper'd in my ears That, unless Thebes should have me back again, She would not thrive in arms against the foe That even then was knocking at her doors. Cre. I scarcely thought the selfsame Œdipus, Who scarce would heed Apollo's Prophet once, Should for a Prophet's take the wandering voice Of rumour in the wind. Œd. And, did I not, As, spite of taunt, now better taught, I do, The pious Creon never fail'd in faith, And by his presence here and now attests That wandering voice from Delphi told me true: And somewhat more. For, to be plain with you, Another wind, that not from Delphi blew, But somehow slipping through your city gates, Whisper'd how Thebes, of that same Oracle From Delphi self-assured, but not the less, Despite of Augur and of Soothsayer, Still apprehensive of my presence there, Would have me back—would have me back indeed, Not while I lived to fold me to her heart With those beseeching arms you tell me of, But at arm's length—outside the city walls— Like some infectious leper there to bide Till Death, which surely could not come too fast, And might perchance be quicken'd if too slow, Even in death dishonour'd as in life, Should safely hide me in the ground below. Cre. What! has some traitor been deluding you With some swoll'n rumour of the market-place? Œd. Traitor to you, as true to me, but not To you more traitor than to you yourself, If, as I think, who cannot see your face— I thank the Gods I cannot—but those here Shall witness where the startled countenance Convicts the false denial of the tongue. Cre. Ev'n were that babbling traitor's word as true As he is false, I see not Œdipus Much otherwise among his new friends here, Than among those he counts for foes at home. Œd. You see not, for you know not how ere long— How soon I know not, but not long, I know— What others here now witness, standing round, And some you see not watching underground, Why from this spot, by which I first set foot, I would not—no, not to be seated by King Theseus' side in his Acropolis, I would not move until I went to die. Whether or no you guess my mystery, Enough! you see I have unravell'd yours. Begone! You lose but time and tongue—Begone! And tell your people this on your return: That, were the word from Delphi, and the word From Thebes as false as you pretend it—yea, False as yourself—I would not back with you; No—not were all the Dragon brood of Thebes, From the first armèd harvest of the teeth That ancient Cadmus sow'd the field withal Raised from the dust to join the living host Who yell'd me forth—all these, and all the way From Thebes to Athens grovelling at your heels Back would I not with you—no, not to reign Enthroned among them as I was before, Much less a tainted leper like to lie Outside your walls while living, and, when dead, There huddled under as a thing accursed, Save for the Victory that within me lies, And shall but quicken as the body dies. No; the same answer that I make to you, Take home with you to all: on this same spot Of earth, which now I stand a beggar on, Beside this consecrated Grove, in which By no delusive Inspiration drawn I first set foot—I say, my Throne is here, Deep-based as Hades, fix'd as Fate itself; And this poor staff I long have lean'd upon The Sceptre, wherewith from the world beneath I shall direct the issues of the war That shall determine wingèd Victory To settle on the Land where tomb'd I lie. Cre. Theseus, in vain to reason with a man, Still more the slave that evermore he was Of Passion which inveterates with years; Suspecting even those who mean him well, As once myself; and when, to his own cost, Falsely he found, as with such men it fares, He first injustice justifies by worse. Therefore to you, King Theseus, and to these Grave Councillors of Athens, I appeal: And, irrespective of the ties that bind All men to kith and country, but which he, Despite all loving offer on their side, Irreconcilably repudiates—ask, If that same Oracle which he pretends By some vague rumour reach'd his ears say true, And that victorious power, as he pretends, Be lodged in him, whether alive or dead— Is he not bound, reluctant though he be, With his returning presence to requite The deadly mischief which it wrought before?— A Pestilence so terrible to Thebes As almost to extermination thinn'd Her people, and yet leaves but half array'd Against the foe now knocking at her doors. For such a foe we have to deal withal— Adrastus, King of Argos, who, by this Man's son, and by his own ambition, led, Has, with some several powers allied with him, Raised such a Force as threatens to destroy What little life the Father left in Thebes, And either to reconquer and there reign, Or raze our sacred ramparts to the dust. And on that second count I ask again— Whether, if that wing'd Victory do indeed Abide with him, he be not doubly bound, By now submission to his country's will To counter-expiate his son's revolt, While for past wrong atoning for himself? And furthermore I ask, would it beseem A King and People wise and just as this, If not with Thebes confederate, not her Foe, Who, disregarding, as I know you do, All visionary profit for yourselves, Would not escape that censure in men's eyes, Withholding—nay, before those jealous eyes Upholding—one who, for his sake—still more For hers who innocently shares the shame— Were better in the bosom of his own To veil the remnant of a life defaced If not by Crime—yet by Calamity So crime-akin—so terrible—twofold— Of Parricide and— Œd. Shameless villain, hold Who in the compass of this brief appeal Before these reverend Elders and their King, Dare show the double face and double tongue For which of old you were notorious: First with fair honey-sweet cajoling words Seeking to entice; and, when the honey fail'd, Intimidating with unsheathèd sting, As impotent to wound as that to win. Intimidate, I say—not me alone, But this great People and their Sovereign, Who dare, forsooth, who dare between us stand With talk—O not of Crime forsooth—but of Calamity so crime-like—'twas the word— So cunningly confused, that when at first You came, propitiation on your tongue, The word of pity floated on the top, But when that fail'd, then Crime came uppermost, And Crime left ringing in this people's ears. Lest which—albeit but empty breath, I know, To good King Theseus, and his Councillors, But with the Citizens, less well advised, Ring out the old alarm that shall again— And let it!—rouse the cry of baffled Thebes, I will arrest, and from denial false, Or the less guilty silence of consent, Convict you once for all, and let you go. Was't not predicted, ev'n before my birth, By Phœbus, Fate's unerring Oracle, That I should slay my father? And the God Provided for his own accomplishment, Ev'n by the very means that father took To wrench out of my hands his destiny, As old Kithæron wots of to this hour. For Fate, that was not to be baffled thus, And Phœbus, that was not to be forsworn, There found and rear'd me till my arm was strong To do the execution they fore-doom'd. Yea, on the very road King Laius Again was going to that Oracle He fondly dream'd—as afterward his son More vainly bragg'd—of having foil'd before, I met—I smote—I slew—my Father—yes— And you, before this presence, answer me! If one you knew not save that King he were, Upon the public thoroughfare of men Had struck you, no less royal than himself; Would you, sedate and pious as you are, In youth and courage strong as I was then— Would you have paused to think whether, in all The roll of human possibility The man who smote you might not in his veins Have running blood akin to that in yours, Or, in the sudden wrath of self-defence, Retaliated with a counter-blow? Yea! as the very Father whom I slew, Could his voice reach us though the earth between, Would ev'n now bear me witness, as he shall When I rejoin him in the world below; That, howsoever for the world's behoof, The Gods, albeit with pitying eyes from heaven, Chastise the guiltless instruments of crime For which they know that Fate is chargeable, They look not with a like compassion down Upon those mortal agents of their doom Who, with a vengeance more implacable, Pursue and persecute—ay, let it be The Parricide!—The Parricide!— And for that yet more terrible mischance That follow'd—and for which yourselves in Thebes Were, under Destiny, responsible— All shameless as thou art, art not ashamed Before an alien People and their King To breathe—as breathe thou wert about to do Had not I swept it from thy lips unsaid The Word which not myself alone involves, But one—whose Memory Thou least of all Shouldst have untomb'd—involves, I say, in that Which unaware to have done is less shame Than with aforethought malice to proclaim! Cho. If to King Creon Reason heretofore Seem'd choked in wrath, 'tis not to wonder now That, with this burst of Fury overwhelm'd, He leaves in silence Theseus to reply. Thes. Albeit on either side appeal'd to now, And whichsoever way myself inclined, I shall not from my former purpose swerve; To stand as Witness, not as Arbiter, Between two Princes of an alien land, Whereof one yet is Ruler, and though fall'n From rule the other, still a King to me. To whom, first coming to the land I rule, I pledged an oath by those Eumenides Beside whose sanctuary e'en now we stand, That if Persuasion and fair Argument Should fail with him,—as fail'd it has, you see, Nor less with her, who, wedded to his fate, Clings all the closer to her father's side— No power but Heav'n's should move him from my land. And therefore, heedless what the world may say, Well knowing that my hospitality To no remoter self-advantage looks, I should not—even if not engaged by oath— I should not from my plighted promise swerve. Cre. I may not, were I minded—I, with these Few followers—in the teeth of Athens arm'd, Arraign the adverse judgment of their King; But to the courteous welcome I have met, Reciprocating with a like farewell, Must to my people leave on my return How minded, and how temper'd, to receive This unforeseen denial of their right. Thes. That you shall settle with your friends at home; And in what temper and to what result Among yourselves decided and declared, Thebes shall not find our Athens unprepared. Chorus Strophe 1 Were I where the dauntless train Swells the battle's brazen roar; On the hallow'd Pythian plain; Or the torch-illumined shore, Where for men their holy flame O'er the sacred Mysteries wakes, And 'mongst Priests of honour'd name Where his station Silence takes, Wont his golden key to bear In his firm tongue-locking hand! There the warrior Theseus, there Join'd the virgin sisters stand; There they shall soon the conflict share, And pour the torrent rage of war. Antistrophe 1. Westward haply on the plain, Where the white and rocky steep Tow'rs o'er Oia's rich domain, May th' ensanguined battle sweep: Where impetuous in their speed, Glowing with the flames of war, Warriors spur the foaming steed, Other warriors roll the car. Brave the youths who here reside, Brave th' Athenian troops in fight; Shine their reins with martial pride, All their trappings glitter bright; These honours in their rich array To Pallas all and Neptune pay. Strophe 2. Is the dreadful work begun? Or does ought their force delay? O let me give the glad presages way! Soon shall yon bright ethereal sun Behold him, vaunting now no more, Compell'd th' afflicted virgin to restore, Afflicted through her father's woes. Each day some deed effected shows, The ruling hand of righteous Jove. I am the prophet of a prosperous fight. Had I the pennons of a dove High o'er the clouds to whirl my flight, Then should my raptured eyes behold The victory my thoughts foretold. Antistrophe 2. Thou in heav'n's high throne adored, Sovereign of the gods above, Give strength, O pow'rful all-beholding Jove, Give conquest to my country's lord; With glory mark his purple way, And make the ambush'd foe an easy prey! Pallas, propitious hear my pray'r, And show that Athens is thy care! Thee, Hunter Phœbus, skill'd to trace The sylvan savage in his rapid flight; Thee, whom the pleasures in the chase Of the fleet, spotted hind delight, Thee I implore, chaste Huntress Maid, Aid her brave sons, our country aid! Œdipus, Antigone, Messenger, Chorus. Mes. Where is King Œdipus? Cho. Behold him here. Mes. King Œdipus, Theseus, of Athens King, Hath sent me back with this report full speed: That Creon with a cloud of armèd men Whom we found ambush'd on a neighbouring height, Without encounter, but with lowering brows, And muttered thunder of Revenge to come, Broke up and blew away the way they came. Œd. The Gods be praised, and Theseus blest withal! Mes. Who bids me tell you further what myself Did also witness; that, as we returned, Before Poseidon's Altar by the way, Whereat we stay'd to sacrifice and pray, A strange man, as with distant travel worn, And low beneath a load of sorrow bow'd, By that same Altar they both worshipp'd at Besought a boon of Theseus; and, when ask'd His country, name, and parentage replied, From Argos— Œd. Argos! Mes. But himself, he said, The Son of Œdipus, once King of Thebes, Whom, ere he went to conquer and retrieve By arms the throne usurp'd from both in Thebes, With many tears King Theseus he besought To see, perchance before he went to die: And Theseus, moved by pity for the man, And reverence for the shrine by which he pray'd— Œd. I will not see him! Cho. Nay, consider yet; As by the sacred earth you stand beside From Theseus welcome for yourself you found, So by the shrine at which with Theseus pray'd Your son, refuse not what to Creon granted Of hearing and reply. Mes. So pray'd the King. Ant. Oh, Father, young and maiden as I am, Unfit to lift my voice among these men, Yet hear me—if not for my brother's sake, May be less guilty than you now believe, Or if yet guilty, not impenitent, Who comes to plead forgiveness at your feet— If not for his sake, Father, yet for mine— Let me but see my brother's face once more, And hear his voice, before he goes to die. Œd. You know not what you ask, Antigone; But thus by Theseus at the altar's side Entreated, let what has to be be done, And leave me to such peace as may be mine. Cho. And yonder, lo! the solitary man Comes slowly weeping hither. Ant. Oh, my brother! Cho. Approach, unhappy man, approach, and plead Your sorrows, and, as you deserve, succeed. Polynices, Œdipus, Antigone, Chorus. Pol. Appeal! Alas, how scarcely dare approach, Who scarce aloof dare contemplate through tears That Vision of paternal majesty, Or his misfortune like my own deplore! Beholding him an outcast like myself, In sorry raiment—travel-torn as mine— With that bow'd head, those tangled locks that fall O'er the benighted temple of his brows; And her, who, like my father, loved me once, And even now whose falling tears confess That ev'n the eternal love she bears to him Hath not yet quencht the Sister in her heart— Oh, wretched, and part-guilty as I am, Albeit the judgment on yourself you brought, Of living worse than death that Thebes might live, Had I but known—but heard—much more had seen, What now I see, and know, had never been; Never had been—much less so long endured, And shall no longer, now I witness, be, Despite of those who drown'd my single voice, As now their treason has confounded me. No word? No sign? revolted from me still?— For, were I guilty as you guilty deem, Yet not so guilty as Eteocles, Who proves himself arch-criminal tow'rd you By after treason to your elder-born, Seizing the Throne which, if you leave, devolves Upon your first-born second self in me. This hath Eteocles, my Brother, done, By subornation of the Citizens, With the connivance of the subtle Creon, Who spins his web within the City walls To catch the Sons, their Father as he caught, Involving us in that unnatural strife By which he purposes, when rid of one, To rule the other; or, destroying both, Himself in title as in deed to reign. Thus me, who least came easy to his hand, Hath he like you driv'n out, like you to seek And find a country and a home elsewhere; You, on this hospitable soil, with this Great Sovereign and his generous people here; Whom, without asking further service from, Nor wishing to dissever from your side, Unless by restoration to your own To sweeten separation from themselves, I do implore you, Father, were it but With one relenting gesture of the hand, One speechless inclination of the head, Vouchsafe your wretched son some dawning sign Of that forgiveness, wherewith fully arm'd, I may for more than past misdeed atone, By vengeance upon those who wrong us both. For when, so foully by those two betray'd, I fled to Argos, King Adrastus there Gave me not only welcome when I came, But after, when possess'd of all my wrongs, His daughter's hand in wedlock; and with that, By way of dowry, such an Host in Arms, As, with the favour of the Gods, which your Forgiveness, oh my Father! shall secure, Shall Thebes recover, and re-throne us both. For look! for us a seven-fold Armament By seven such Champions headed and array'd As yet the world has not together seen, Leagued in our cause; Amphiaraus first, For Divination famous as for Arms, Knowing the issue of the War he joins; Ætolian Tydeus next; and next to him Eteoclus of Argos; and the fourth, Hippomedon: then Capaneus, who boasts Of bringing down the walls of Thebes by Fire: Parthenopæus next of Arcady, So from his mother Atalanta named: And seventh, and last, myself, your elder-born, And right successor to your dynasty. With sev'n such Champions, and with such an Host, One need we yet to consecrate our arms And triumph in the cause which is your own. Wherefore, repenting what unfilial wrong, By others wrought on, I have done to you, Hither on foot from Argos am I come, A contrite suppliant at my Father's feet; Imploring him, by all those Household Gods Whose statues are before our palace door— Yea, by the faithful men within the walls, Who, to a statue-like inaction cow'd, Stand mutely wondering for their absent lord— And for her sake who, having shared so long Your sorrow, now your triumph shall partake— Remit your righteous wrath against a son, Who, tow'rd you guilty as he may have been, And all distasteful in your eyes as now, Shall now for more than past misdeed atone, Or, in just retribution failing, fall. (After a long pause.) Œd. Hath this man said all he came charged to say? Cho. So from the unruffled silence into which His words have fall'n and vanish'd I conceive. Œd. But that the Sovereign Ruler of this Land Had sent this man to me, and thought it well That I should hear and answer, hear I might, But not a word of answer from my lips: No, nor a sign, save with averted face, And one blind warning of the hand—‘Begone!’ But thus entreated, by the word of one Whose word should be the law of Love to me, And of the friendly Council here beside, I will not only hear, but will reply— Such a reply as he that asks for it Shall wish he had not come so far to hear. Who—Wretch!—who when thou hadst the sovereign power, Which now thy Brother to himself usurps, Then—not cajoled nor forced, as you pretend— For was not I, the Victim, Witness too?— But, one with them, didst set the rabble on To hoot me forth to shame and beggary; Yea, when, not like yourselves implacable, The God allow'd and I besought return, Still shut me out, and, but to serve your ends, Still would have let me linger till I died In a strange country, and in such a plight As now, forsooth, you weep to look upon! Thou hypocrite! with those pretended tears Of false contrition, which, were't true, too late, Think'st to cajole me with a show of Love— Ay, of such Love wherewith a man regards The tool he needs to work his purpose with, And forthwith fling regardlessly away, Laying on those the load of infamy Thou sharèdst with them of the royal spoil They stole from me, and now, like other thieves, Would keep between themselves, outwitting thee, Who, them outwitting, to thyself wouldst keep? Oh Fool as Hypocrite! suspecting not How that most cunning rogue of all the three Has been before you, and the mask you wear, But that, behind it playing such a part In his mid passion he was forced to drop, And, as he fled discomfited away, Left you to wear, and to a like result. Fools both, as Hypocrites! suspecting not That he you would deceive your errand knows, Each to win back the stolen stakes you lost— The Kingdom once without the King, but now The King himself to bring the Kingdom back; Who, flung before as offal from your walls, Is now become a treasure of such price As each of you would fain get home again, Like stolen treasure—to be buried there. You see I know your errand: if you fail To guess my answer— One way lies Argos, and another Thebes, Which those tired feet might fail to reach in time; But could you borrow Hermes' feather'd heel Might catch your Rival ere the Sun goes down, And from his lip learn all. If not from him, Then somewhat later, from your brother there, When you shall meet him, arm to arm, in arms, Under the wall where you would bury me. Then might you tell him in return, were not The story swallow'd up enacting it, How, as he speaks, your living Father's Ghost Foresees you both, up-looking from the tomb In which your hopes of conquest die with him, You, not the Champion leading, lance-erect, Your Argive Host to sack your native Thebes; Nor him within it in mock majesty Posting his people to defend the Gates: Not thus, but in your golden feathers both, Where one another challenging you stood, Stretch'd in the dust, slain by each other's hand. This, standing on the consecrated ground Of those avenging Sisters underneath Who hear, and even as I speak prepare To do their destined work, I prophesy; You never to reconquer or regain The Kingdom lost where he shall never reign; But ev'n before the walls that you contest, Die, slaying him by whom yourself are slain! Cho. Terrible words from human lip to hear! And by what witness from what other world Attested, as methought heard once before, While this man spoke, and heav'n and earth look'd clear! Ant. Alas! Alas! for my belovèd Brother! Pol. Ay, and Alas! not for myself alone, But for all those arm'd in my cause, Alas! To whom returning I may not reveal The doom of death to me, to them defeat! Ant. Oh then by all you worship, and hold dear, Return to Argos not; or, if return, Revealing that you carry back with you, Revolt them from your fatal Enterprise, And, leaving graceless Thebes to go her way, With those you loved, and you are loved by, live! Pol. Love me they would no more, Antigone, If, having roused them at the trumpet's sound To arms, both Men and Champions, in my cause, Then to dissuade them, if dissuade I could, By rumour of uncertain Prophecies, And Malediction that to them would seem But empty raving of impotent wrath. Or, ev'n would they retreat, as will they not, Could I endure in Argos to survive My younger brother's laughing-stock in Thebes? Ant. Oh, better that than this unnatural war, Which cannot end, which cannot end, I know, But with the fatal consequence that leads Or haunts my Father's footsteps where he goes! While the false Creon, who has set you on, Shall mock you both, who die that he may win! Pol. Too late, too late, Antigone, too late! And when that comes which is foredoom'd, and I Lie stark and cold before the walls of Thebes, With him whom slaying I am doom'd to die, Shall not one pious hand, Antigone, Protect your lifeless brother from the dog With some few handfuls of his Mother Earth? Ant. Oh, but it shall not need! You shall not go! If not for Love, in Pity, for you both, My Father shall relent! Pol. But Fate shall not. Œd. No, by that other roll of thunder, no! Cho. Again! Yet not a cloud in Heav'n above— Œd. These are no thunders from the hand of Zeus, But the dark Ruler of the World below, Reverberating from the vault of Heav'n— Shall some one here go straightway to your King, And bid him, whatsoever busied with— Yea, were it by the Altar worshipping, Forthwith unworshipp'd leave it; for the God Who links the Fate of Athens with mine own, By those three thunders hence has summon'd me. Gather no dust upon the feet of him Who goes this errand: for the God, I know, Who, brandishing aloft his Oracles Accomplish'd, in one compass of the sky From my meridian drove me to my fall, And, as himself he sank behind the Night, Into the hands of those who therein rule My destiny resign'd—the God, I say, Whose rising found me here, with his descent Shall take me down with him, and leave me there. Chorus. Strange things hath this day witness'd and heard tell By the strange man whom Phœbus from the stream Of Ocean rising with his levell'd beam Surprised, as with a cloud of Oracle Encompass'd, in the consecrated shade Of those who underneath more darkly dwell, Whose more propitious name scarce daring we To whisper, he—seemingly not unheard— No, nor unanswer'd—calls on undismay'd. Strange things—and if the word of presage hold, Not unattested by those thunders three, Yet stranger are we likely to behold, Prophetical of Evil if to some, To Athens, and her People and her Kings, Auspicious all, and for all time to come. Theseus, Œdipus, Antigone, Chorus. Thes. Look, at your bidding, Œdipus, once more I come, prepared to do as I have done Of hospitable service all I may. Œd. Yea, once more, Theseus, and for one last time, Before the God recalls me to himself, Have I recall'd you, to solicit nought, But the good service of a single day, Which, were life longer, were, I know, life-long, With Death's eternal blessing to repay: Which when I prophesied as soon to be, Not knowing then how soon; but knowing now. Thes. By what assurance, Œdipus? Œd. By those Three subterranean thunders summon'd hence. Thes. From Athens? Œd. From the eyes of Athens, ay; And yet nowhither else: a mystery Whose peremptory resolution The God who loves you but for you delays. Thes. I must believe that one whom destiny Hath step by step oracularly led, Reads and interprets right the wondrous Signs Which others but attest and wonder at. Œd. And for a further witness and a last— Blind as I am, and hitherto so long Compell'd to find my way with others' eyes, Myself shall those who led me forthwith lead Along the road where that shall have to be Which other eyes than Theseus' none may see. Which having seen, King Theseus, in your heart Keep unreveal'd; and when you come to die, To him alone who after you the Throne Of Athens mounts reveal it; he in turn To him who him shall follow; and so forth, From hand to hand, until the end of Time: Not trusting that into the People's hand, Who, loyal, wise, and pious, let them be, Seducible by those seditious few That still infest the soundest Commonweal, Abuse the power committed to their hands, And by disorder and revolt at home Lay bare your bosom to the foe without. And now the Powers to you and yours Benign, Who thrice have call'd me from the world below, Now that the word of vantage in your heart Is register'd, will brook no more delay, And the mute Hermes of the lower world, Ev'n as I speak, prepares to lead the way. Chorus. Strophe. If I may thee, infernal Queen, Thou gloomy pow'r by mortal eyes unseen, With holy awe revere; And thee, stern Monarch, whose terrific sway The dreary realms of night obey, Hear Pluto, Pluto hear! Let not pangs of tort'ring pow'r Rack the stranger's dying hour, While the cheerless path he treads To the Stygian house that leads.— Guiltless thou wast doom'd to know Various ills and bitter woe: May the god with just regard Grace thee with a bright reward! Antistrophe. Ye awful pow'rs, from realms of night Who vengeful rise the guilty to affright! And thou, grim Dog of Hell, Before the iron gates of Pluto spread Enormous on thy horrid bed, With many a hideous yell Whilst thy echoing cave resounds, Guarding fierce those dismal bounds; Thou, whom Earth to Tartarus bore, Cease, oh cease thy dreaded roar; Gentle meet him in those glades; When he joins the silent shades; Ever wakeful, cease t'appal; Dog of Hell on thee I call! Messenger, Chorus. Mes. O citizens of Athens, to sum up In fewest words what, to be told at large, Would need an apter tongue than mine to tell— King Œdipus— Cho. Is dead— Mes. I say not that; From human eyes departed, I will say; And with such circumstance as, could I tell All that myself I saw, who saw not all— Cho. But, if not all, yet what you saw, recount. Mes. How the blind King, by what interior light Guided himself we know not, guided us, You that were present witness for yourselves; And how with Theseus and the woeful Maid Beside him, and some wondering few behind, Straightforward, with unhesitating step, That needed not his staff to feel the way, Led on; till, reach'd the threshold of the road Which leads, they say, down to the nether world, Beside the monumental stone that marks Where our King Theseus and Peirithous, After long warfare, plighted hands of peace, He stopp'd, sat down, his tatter'd raiment loosed, And bade his daughter from the running brook Bring him wherewith himself to purify. Which she, resorting to the nearest field Of Ceres, with what decent haste she might, Return'd, and wash'd him, and in raiment clean Reclothed, as to the rite of Burial due. And when all this was done, as for the Dead, Weeping himself, he folded in his arms His weeping child, and told her, from that hour, She that so long had suffer'd for his sake, With but the love between them to requite, The face of him she loved must see no more. And so they wept together for a while, Together folded in each other's arms, And all was silent else; when suddenly, A thunder-speaking voice, as from the jaws Of earth that yawn'd beneath us, call'd aloud: ‘Ho! Thou there! Why so long a-coming? Come!’ Then Œdipus, who knew the word, and whence, Relax'd his folding arms, and, rising up, Took Theseus' hand, and, in it laying hers, Besought him never to desert the child, Nor yield her up to any against her will, But be to her the Father whom she lost. To which King Theseus having pledged his word, The other, folding in one last embrace, With one last kiss, his daughter to his heart, Bade her return with us and never once Look back on what was not for any one But for King Theseus and himself to know. Which said, and all in awful wonder hush'd, The weeping Daughter turn'd away with us, Slowly, like those who leave a funeral pyre, With us our way re-tracing; until I, Seized with a longing I could not control, Despite the word yet ringing in my ears, Look'd back—and saw King Theseus standing there, Stock-still, his hands before his eyes, like one Smit with a sudden blaze: but Œdipus There—anywhere—there was not—vanish'd—gone— But, whether by someflash from Heav'n despatch'd, Or by His hand who through the shatter'd Earth Had summon'd him in thunder, drawn below, No living man but Theseus' self may know. Chorus. Let not the Man by Man be deem'd unblest, Who, howsoever in the midnight gloom Encompass'd of inexorable Doom That shrouds him from his Zenith to the West, Not till he sink below the Verge redeems His unexpected Lustre in such beams As reaching Heav'n-aloft enshrine his Tomb. (or as follows) Strange Destinies of Man! But in the range Of Destiny recorded none more strange Than his, who, from his Sovereign Glory hurl'd, Among strange men a Spectacle became Of Horror and Reproach about the World: Till by the Left blank in MS.M hand That drove him forth and forward to the land Of sacred Athens led, he did repay The hospitable Welcome of one day With such Farewell of Welfare as on those Who serve him some departing God bestows, His tutelary care bequeathing—yea, Himself bequeathing albeit pass'd away. Nor let the Man by Man be deem'd unblest Who, howsoever in the midnight gloom Eclipsed of some inexorable Doom That shrouds him from his Zenith to the West, Not till he sinks below the Earth redeems His unextinguish'd lustre in such beams As rising Zenith-high enshrine his Tomb.</field>
