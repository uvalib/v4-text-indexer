      <field name="fulltext">? Nos hÃ¦c Novimus esse nihil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable Roger Earl of ORRERY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE To the Rival-ladies. 'Tis much Desir'd, you Judges of the Town Would pass a Vote to put all Prologues down; For who can show me, since they first were Writ, They e'r Converted one hard-hearted Wit? Yet the World's mended well; in former Days Good Prologues were as scarce, as now good Plays. For the reforming Poets of our Age, In this first Charge, spend their Poetique rage: Expect no more when once the Prologue's done; The Wit is ended e'r the Play's begun. You now have Habits, Dances, Scenes, and Rhymes; High Language often; I, and Sense, sometimes: As for a clear Contrivance doubt it not; They blow out Candles to give Light to th'Plot. And for Surprize, two Bloody-minded Men Fight till they Dye, then rise and Dance agen: Such deep Intrigues you'r welcome to this Day: But blame your Selves, not him who writ the Play; Though his Plot's Dull, as can be well desir'd, Wit stiff as any you have e'r admir'd: He's bound to please, not to Write well; and knows There is a Mode in Plays as well as Cloaths: Therefore kind Judgesâ</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A SECOND PROLOGUE Enters. 2. âHold; Would you admit For Judges all you see within the Pit? 1. Whom would he then Except, or on what Score? 2. All, who (like him) have Writ ill Plays before: For they, like Thieves condemn'd, are Hang-men made, To execute the Members of their Trade. All that are Writing now he would disown; But then he must Except, ev'n all the Town. All Chol'rique, losing Gamesters, who in spight Will Damn to Day, because they lost last Night. All Servants whom their Mistress's scorn upbraids; All Maudlin Lovers, and all Slighted Maids: All who are out of Humour, or Severe; All, that want Wit, or hope to find it here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PersonÃ¦ Dramatis. Don Gonsalvo de Peralta, A young Gentleman, newly arriv'd from the Indies; In love with Julia. Don Rhodorigo de Sylva; In love with the same Lady. Don Manuel de Torres. Brother to Julia. Julia, Elder Sister to Don Manuel; Promis'd to Rhodorigo. Honoria, younger Sister to Don Manuel, disguis'd in the Habit of a Man, and going by the Name of Hippolito; In love with Gonsalvo. Angellina, Sister to Don Rhodorigo, in Man's Habit; Likewise in Love with Gonsalvo, and going by the Name of Amideo. Servants. Robbers. Sea-men. Masquers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scene Alicant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act First. Scene First. Enter Gonsalvo, Servant. The Scene a Wood. Gons. Nay, 'twas a strange as well as cruel Storm, To take us almost in the Port of Sevil, And drive us up as far as Barcellona; The whole Plate-Fleet was scatter'd, some part wrack'd; There one might see the Sailors diligent To cast o'r-board the Merchants envy'd Wealth, While he, all Pale, and Dying, stood in doubt Whether to ease the Burden of the Ship By Drowning of his Ingots, or himself. Serv. Fortune is a Woman every where, But most upon the Sea. Gons. Had that been all I should not have Complain'd but ere we could Repair our Ship, to drive us back again Was such a Crueltyâ Serv. Yet that short time you staid at Barcellona You Husbanded so well, I think you left A Mistress there. Gons. I made some small Essays Of Love, what might have been I cannot tell: But to leave that, upon what part of Spain Are we now cast? Serv. Sir, I take that City to be Alicante. Gons. Some days must of necessity be spent In looking to our Ship; then back again For Sevil. Serv. There you'r sure you shall be welcome. Gons. I, if my Brother Rodorick be return'd From Flanders; but 'tis now three Years since I Have heard from him, and since I saw him twelve. Serv. Your growth, and your long absence in the Indies Have alter'd you so much, he'l scarcely know you. Gons. I'm sure I should not him, and less my Sister; Who, when I with my Uncle went this Voyage, Was then one of those little prating Girls Of whom fond Parents tell such tedious stories: Well, go you back. Serv. I go Sir. Gons. And take care None of the Sea-men slip ashore. Serv. I shall Sir; [Exit Servant. Gons. Ile walk a little while among these Trees, Now the fresh Evening air blows from the Hills, And breaths the sweetness of the Orange flowers Upon me, from the Gardens neer the City. Robbers within. 1 Rob. I say, make sure, and Kill him; Hip. For Heaven's dear sake have pity on my Youth; [Within. Gons. Some violence is offer'd in the Wood By Robbers to a Traveller: Who ere Thou art, humanity obliges me To give thee succour. Hip. Help! Ah cruel men! [Within. Gons. This way I think the Voice came, 'tis not far. [Exit. The Scene draws, and discovers Hippolito bound to a Tree, and two Robbers by him with drawn Swords. 2 Rob. Strip him, and let him go: 1 Rob. Dispatch him quite; off with his Doublet quickly. Hip. Ah me unfortunate! Enter Gonsalvo, seizes the Sword of one of them, and runs him through; then after a little resistance Disarms the other. 2 Rob. If you have mercy in you spare my Life; I never was consenting to a Deed So black as Murder, though my Fellow urg'd me: I only meant to Rob, and I am punisht Enough, in missing of my wicked aim. Gons. Do they rob Angels here? This sweet Youth has A Face so like one which I lately saw It makes your Crime of Kin to Sacrilege: But Live; and henceforth Take nobler Courses to maintain your Life: Here's something that will rescue you from want, Till you can find employment. [Gives him Gold, and unbinds Hippolito. Hip. What strange adventure's this! How little hop'd I, When thus Disguis'd I stole from Barcellona, To be reliev'd by brave Gonsalvo here? [Aside. 2 Rob. That Life you have preserv'd shall still be yours; And that you may perceive, how much my Nature Is wrought upon by this your generous Act; That goodness you have shown to me, Ile use To others for your Sake, if you dare trust me A moment from your Sight. Gons. Nay, take your Sword, I will not so much crush a Budding virtue As to suspect. [Gives him his Sword. [Exit Robber. âSweet Youth, you shall not leave me Till I have seen you safe. Hip. You need not doubt it: Alas! I find I cannot if I would; I am but freed to be a greater Slave: [Aside. How much am I oblig'd, Sir, to your Valour? Gons. Rather to your own Sweetness, pretty Youth; You must have been some way preserv'd, though I Had not been neer; my Aid did but prevent Some Miracle more slowly setting out To save such Excellence. Hip. How much more gladly could I hear those words, If he that Spoke them knew he Spoke to me! [Aside. Enter the Robber again with Don Manuel, and Julia bound. My Brother and my Sister Pris'ners too! They cannot sure discover me through this Disguise; however Ile not Venture it. [Steps behind the Trees. 2 Rob. This Gentleman and Lady [To Gonsalvo privately. My Fellows bound. [Exit Robber. Man. We must prepare to Dye; This is the Captain of the Picarons. Jul. Me-thinks he looks like one; I have a strange Aversion to that Man; He's fatal to me. Gons. I ne'r saw Excellence in Woman-kind [Stares on her. Till now, and yet discern it at the first: Perfection is discover'd in a moment. He that ne'r saw the Sun before, yet knows him. Jul. How the Villain stares upon me! Gons. Wonder prepares my Soul, and then Love enters: But wonder is so close pursu'd by Love, That like a Fire it warms as soon as born. Man. If we must Dye, what need these Circumstances? Jul. Heav'n defend me from him. Gons. Why Madam, can you doubt a Rudeness from me? Your very Fears and Griefs create an awe, Such Majesty they bear; me-thinks I see Your Soul retir'd within her inmost Chamber, Like a fair Mourner sit in State, with all The silent Pomp of Sorrow round about her. Man. Your Language does express a Man bred up To worthier ways than those you follow now: Gons. What does he mean? [Aside, Man. If (as it seems) you Love; Love is a passion Which kindles honour into noble Acts: Restore my Sisters liberty; oblige her, And see what Gratitude will work. Gons. All this is stranger yet. Man. What ere a Brothers power To morrow can do for you, claim it boldly. Gons. I know not why you think your selves my Pris'ners; This Ladies freedome is a thing too precious To be dispos'd by any but her Self: But value this small Service as you please, Which you reward too Prodigally, Ly Permitting me to Pay her more. Jul. Love from an Out-law? from a Villain love? If I have that pow'r on thee thou pretend'st, Go and persue thy Mischiefs, but presume not To follow me:âcome Brother. [Exeunt Julia, Manuel. Gons. Those foul names of Out-law, and of Villain, I never did deserve: They raise my wonder. [Walks. Dull that I was, not to find this before? She took me for the Captain of the Robbers: It must be so; Ile tell her her mistake. Goes out hastily, and returns immediately. She's gone, She's gone, and who or whence she is I cannot tell; me-thinks she should have left A Track so bright I might have follow'd her; Like setting Suns that Vanish in a Glory. O Villain that I am! O hated Villain! Enter Hippolito again. Hip. I cannot suffer you to wrong your self So much; for though I do not know your Person, Your Actions are too fair, too noble, Sir, To merit that foul Name: Gons. Prithee do not flatter me, I am a Villain, That admirable Lady said I was. Hip. I fear you Love her, Sir. Gons. No, no; not Love her: Love is the name of some more gentle passion; Mine is a Fury grown up in a moment To an extremity, and lasting in it: An heap of Powder set on Fire, and burning As long as any ordinary Fewel. Hip. How could he Love so soon? and yet alas! What cause have I to ask that question? Who lov'd him the first Minute that I saw him: I cannot leave him thus, though I perceive His heart ingag'd another way. [Aside. Sir, can you have such pity on my Youth, [To him. On my forsaken, and my helpless Youth, To take me to your Service? Gons. Would'st thou serve A Mad-man? how can he take care of thee Whom Fortune and his Reason have abandon'd? A Man that saw, and Lov'd, and disoblig'd, Is Banish'd, and is Mad, all in a moment. Hip. Yet you alone have Title to my Service; You make me Yours by your preserving me: And that's the title Heav'n has to Mankind. Gons. Prithee no more. Hip. I know your Mistriss too: Gons. Ha! dost thou know the person I adore? Answer me quickly; Speak, and Ile receive thee: Hast thou no Tongue? Hip. Why, Did I say I knew her? All I can hope for, if I have my wish To Live with-him, is but to be Unhappy. [Aside. Gons. Thou false and lying Boy, to say thou knewst her; Prethee say something, though thou Cosen'st me. Hip. Since you will know, her name is Julia, Sir, And that young Gentleman you saw, her Brother, Don Manuel de Torres. Gons. Say I should take thee, Boy, and should employ thee To that fair Lady, wouldst thou serve me faithfully? Hip. You ask me an hard question; I can Dye For you, perhaps I cannot Woo so well. Gons. I knew thou wouldst not do't. Hip. I swear I would: But, Sir, I grieve to be the Messenger Of more unhappy News; She must be Married This Day to one Don Rodorick de Sylva, Betwixt whom and her Brother there has been A long (and it was thought a mortal) Quarrel, But now it must for ever end in Peace: For hapning both to Love each others Sisters, They have concluded it in a cross Marriage; Which, in the Pallace of Don Rodorick, They went to Celebrate from their Country-house, When, taken by the Thieves, you rescu'd them. Gons. Me-thinks I am grown patient on a suddain; And all my Rage is gone: Like losing Gamesters Who fret and storm, and swear at little Losses: But, when they see all hope of Fortune vanish'd, Submit and gain a Temper by their Ruine. Hip. Would you could cast this Love, which troubles you Out of your mind. Gons. I cannot Boy; but since Her Brother, with intent to Cozen me, Made me the promise of his best assistance; Ile take some course to be reveng'd of him. Is going out, But stay, I charge thee, Boy, discover not To any who I am; Hip. Alas, I cannot, Sir, I know you not. Gons. Why, there's it; I am Mad again; Oh Love! Hip. Oh Love! [Exeunt ambo. Scene the Second. Enter two Servants of Don Rodorick's, placing Chairs, and Talking as they place them. 1 Serv. Make ready quickly there; Don Manuel And his fair Sister, that must be our Lady, Are coming in. 2. They have been long expected; 'Tis Evening now, and the Canonique hours For Marriage are past. 1. The nearer Bed-time The better still; my Lord will not deferr it: He swears the Clergy are no fit Judges Of our Necessities. 2. Where is my Lord? 1. Gone out to meet his Bride. 2. I wonder that my Lady Angellina Went not with him, She's to be Married too. 1. I do not think she Fancies much the Man; Only, to make the Reconcilement perfect Betwixt the Families, she's Passive in it; The choice being but her Brother's, not her Own. 2. Troth, wer't my case, I car'd not who chose for me: 1. Nor I; 'twould save the Process of a tedious Passion, A long Law-suit of Love, which quite consumes An honest Lover ere he gets of Possession: I would come plump, and fresh, and all my Self, Serv'd up to my Brides Bed like a fat Fowl, Before the Frost of Love had nipt me through. I look on Wives as on good dull Companions, For elder Brothers to Sleep out their time with; All we can hope for in the Marriage-bed, Is but to take our Rest; and what care I Who lays my Pillow for me. Enter a Poet with Verses. 2. Now, what's your business Friend? Poet. An Epithalamium, to the Noble Bridegrooms. 1. Let me see; Whats here? as I live [Takes it. Nothing but down-right Bawdry: Sirrah, Rascal, Is this an Age for Ribaldry in Verse? When every Gentleman in Town, speaks it With so much better grace, than thou canst write it: I'le beat thee with a staff of thy own own Rhimes. Poet. Nay, Good Sir? [Runs off, and Exit. 2. Peace, They are here. Enter Don Rodorick, Don Manuel, Julia, and Company. 1. My Lord looks sullenly, and fain would hide it. 2. Howe'r he weds Don Manuels Sister, yet I fear he's hardly reconcil'd to him. Jul. I tremble at it still. Rod. I must confess Your danger great: But, Madam, since 'tis past To speak of it were to renew your Fears. My noble Brother, welcome to my Breast. Some call my Sister; say, Don Manuel Her Bridegroom waits. Man. Tell her, in both the Houses There now remains no Enemy but she. Rod. In the mean time lets Dance; Madam, I hope You'l grace me with your Hand:â Enter Leonora, Woman to Angellina; Takes the two Men aside. Leon. O Sir, my Lady Angellina! Rod. Why comes she not? Leon. Is fall'n extreamly Sick. Both. How! Leon. Nay, Trouble not your selves too much, These Fits are usual with Her; and not Dangerous. Rod. O rarely Counterfeited. [Aside. Man. May not I see her? Leon. She does by me, deny her Self that honour. [As she Speaks steals a Note into his hand. I shall return, I hope, with better News; In the mean time she prays, you'l not disturb The Company. [Exit Leonora. Rod. This troubles me exceedingly. Man. A Note put privately into my hand By Angellina's Woman? She's my Creature: There's something in't; I'l read it to my Self.â [Aside. Rod. Brother, what Paper's that? Man. Some begging Verses Deliver'd me this Morning on my Wedding. Rod. Pray let me see 'um: Man. I have many Copies, Please you to entertain your Self with these. [Gives him another Paper. [Manuel reads. Sir, My Lady feigns this Sickness to delude you: Her Brother hates you still; and the Plot is, That he shall Marry first your Sister, And then deny you his.â Yours Leonora.â Postcript. Since I writ this, I have so wrought upon her, (Who of her Self, is Timorous enough) That she believes her Brother will betray her, Or else be forc'd to give her up to You; Therefore, unknown to him, she means to Fly: Come to the Garden door at seven this Evening, And there you may Surprize her; mean time I Will keep her ignorant of all things, that Her fear may still Increase. Enter Leonora again. Rod. How now? how does your Lady? Leon. So ill, she cannot possibly wait on you. Man. Kind Heav'n give me her Sickness. Rod. Those are wishes: What's to be done? Man. We must deferr our Marriages. Rod. Leonora, now! [Aside to her. Leon. My Lady, Sir, has absolutely charg'd Her Brother's should go forward. Rod. Absolutely! Leon. Expresly, Sir, because she says there are So many honourable Persons here, Whom to Defraud of their intended Mirth, And of each others Company, were rude: So hoping your Excuse. [Exit Leonora. Rod. That privilege of Pow'r which Brothers have In Spain, I never us'd: Therefore submit My Will to hers, but with much sorrow, Sir; My happiness should go before, not wait On yours: Lead on. Man. Stay, Sir, though your fair Sister in respect To this Assembly seems to be content Your Marriage should proceed, we must not want So much good Manners as to suffer it. Rod. So much good manners, Brother? Man. âI have said it. Should we to show our Sorrow for her Sickness, Provoke our easie Souls to careless Mirth, As if our drunken Revels were design'd For joy of what she Suffers? Rod. 'Twill be over In a few Days. Man. Your stay will be the less. Rod. All things are now in Readiness, and must not Be put off, for a peevish Humour thus. Man. They must; or I shall think you mean not fairly: Rod. Explain your Self. Man. That you would Marry first, And afterwards refuse me Angellina. Rod. âThink so. Man. You are Rod. Speak softly. Man. A foul Villain. Rod. Thenâ Man. Speak softly. Rod. I'l find a time to tell you, you are one. Man. 'Tis well. Ladies, you wonder at our private Whispers, [To the company. But more will wonder when you know the cause; The Beauteous Angellina is fall'n Ill; And since she cannot with her presence grace This days Solemnity, the Noble Rodorick Thinks fit it be Deferr'd, till she recover; Then, we both hope to have your Companies. Lad. Wishing her Health, we take our Leaves. [Exeunt company. Rod. Your Sister yet will Marry me. Man. She will not: come hither Julia: Jul. What strange afflicting News is this you tell us? Man. 'Twas all this false Man's Plot, that when he had Possest you, he might cheat me of his Sister? Jul. Is this true, Rodorick? Alas his silence Does but too much confess it: How I blush To own that Love I cannot yet take from thee! Yet for my Sake be Friends. Man. 'Tis now too late: I am by honour hinder'd. Rod. I by hate. Jul. What shall I do? Man. Leave him, and come away; Thy Virtue bids thee. Jul. But Love bids me stay. Man. Her Love's so like my Own, that I should blame The Brothers passion in the Sisters flame. Rodorick, we shall meetâHe little thinks I am as sure this Night of Angellina, As he of Julia. [Aside. [Exit Manuel. Rod. Madam, To what an Extasie of Joy Your Goodness raises me! This was an act Of Kindness which no Service e'r can pay. Jul. Yes, Rodorick, 'tis in your Pow'r to quit The Debt you owe me. Rod. Do but name the way. Jul. Then briefly thus, 'tis to be just to me As I have been to you. Rod. You cannot doubt it. Jul. You know I have adventur'd for your sake A Brothers anger, and the Worlds opinion: I Value neither; for a setled Virtue Makes it self Judge, and satisfy'd within, Smiles at that common Enemy, the World. I am no more affraid of flying Censures, Than Heav'n of being Fir'd with mounting Sparkles. Rod. But wherein must my Gratitude consist? Jul. Answer your Self, by thinking what is fit For me to do. Rod. By Marriage, to confirm Our mutual Love. Jul. Ingratefull Rodorick! Canst thou name Marriage, while thou entertain'st A Hatred so unjust against my Brother? Rod. But, unkind Julia, you know the causes Of Love and Hate are hid deep in our Stars, And none but Heav'n can give account of both. Jul. Too well, I know it; for my Love to thee Is Born by Inclination, not by Judgment; And makes my Virtue shrink within my heart, As loath to leave it, and as loath to mingle. Rod. What would you have me do? Jul. Since I must tell thee, Lead me to some near Monastery; there, (Till Heav'n find out some way to make us Happy) I shall be kept in safety from my Brother: Rod. But more from me; What hopes can Rodorick have, That she who leaves him freely, and unforc'd, Should ever of her own accord return? Jul. Thou hast too great assurance of my Faith, That in despight of my own Self I love thee; Be friends with Manuel, I am thine, till when My Honour's;âLead me. [Exeunt. Scene the Third. Enter Don Manuel, Solus. The Scene is the Representation of a Street discover'd by Twilight. Man. This is the time and place where I expect My fugitive Mistress; if I meet with her I may forget the wrongs her Brother did me: If otherwise, his Blood shall expiate them. I hope her Woman keeps her Ignorant How all things pass'd, according to her promise. A door opensâEnter Angellina in Boys Cloaths. Leonora behind at the Door. Leon. I had forgot to tell him of this Habit She has put on; but sure hee'l know her in it. [Aside. Man. Who goes there? Ang. 'Tis Don Manuels Voice; I must run back: The Door shut on me? Leonora, Where? Does she not follow me?âI am betray'd. Man. What are you? Ang. A poor Boy. Man. Do you belong to Rodorick? Ang. Yes, I do. Man. Here's Money for you, tell me where's his Sister: Ang. Just now I met her coming down the stairs, Which lead into the Garden. Man. 'Tis well, leave me In silence. Ang. With all my heart; Was ever such a scape! [Exit. running. Man. She cannot now be long; sure by the Moon-shine I shall discover her: Enter Rodorick, and Julia. This must be she; Ile seize her. Jul. Help me, Rodorick; Rod. Unhand the Lady, Villain. Man. Rodorick! I'm glad we meet alone; now is the time To end our Difference. Rod. I cannot stay. Man. You must. Rod. I will not: Man. 'Tis base to injure any Man; but yet 'Tis far more base, once done not to defend it. Rod. Is this an hour for Valiant Men to Fight? They love the Sun should witness what they do; Cowards have Courage when they see not Death: And fearfull Hares, that sculk in forms all Day, Yet Fight their feeble Quarrels by the Moon-light. Man. No, Light and Darkness are but poor distinctions Of such, whose Courage comes by fits and starts. Rod. Thou urgest me above my patience: This minute of my Life was not my own, But hers I love beyond it: They draw, and Fight. Jul. Help, help; none hear me! Heav'n I think is Deaf too: O Rodorick! O Brother!â Enter Gonsalvo, and Hippolito. Jul. Who ere you are, if you have honour part 'um.â [Manuel stumbles, and falls. Gons. Hold, Sir, you are too Cruel; he that Kills At such advantage fears to Fight again. [Holds Rodorick. Man. Cavalier, I may Live to thank you for this favour. [Rises. Rod. I will not quit you so. Man. Ile breath, and thenâ Jul. Is there no way to save their Lives? Hip. Run out of sight, If 'tis concerning you they Quarrel. [Julia retires to a Corner. Hip. Help, help, as you are Cavaliers; the Lady For whom you thus contend, is seiz'd by some Night-robbing Villains. All. Which way took they? Hip. 'Twas so dark I could not see distinctly: Rod. Let us divide; I this way. [Exit. Gons. Down yonder street Ile take. Man. And I down that. [Exeunt severally. Hip. Now, Madam, may we not lay by our fear? They are all gone. Jul. 'Tis true, but we are here, Expos'd to Darkness without guide or aid, But of our selves. Hip. And of our selves affraid. Jul. These dangers while 'twas Light I could despise, Then I was Bold; but watch'd by many Eyes: Ah! could not Heav'n for Lovers find a way, That prying People still might sleep by Day. Enter Angellina. Hip. Me-thinks I'm certain I discover some; Jul. This was your speaking of 'um made 'um come. Hip. There is but one, perhaps he may go by. Ang. Where had I courage for this bold disguise, Which more my Nature than my Sex belies? Alas! I am betraid to darkness here; Darkness which Virtue hates, and Maids most fear: Silence and Solitude dwell every where: Doggs cease to bark; the Waves more faintly roar, And rowl themselves asleep upon the Shore: No noise but what my Foot-steps make, and they Sound dreadfully, and Louder than by Day: They double too, and every step I take Sounds thick me-thinks, and more than one could make. Ha! Who are these? I wish'd for Company, and now I fear. Who are you gentle People that go there? Jul. His Voice is soft as is the upper Air, Or dying Lovers words: O pity us. Ang. O pity me! Take freely as your own My Gold, my Jewels; spare my Life alone. Hip. Alas he fears as much as we. Jul. What say you Sir, Will you joyn with us. Amid. Yes Madam, but If you would take my Sword, you'l use it better. Hip. I, But you are a Man. Amid. Why, so are you: Hip. Truly my fear had made me quite forget it. Enter Gonsalvo. Gons. Hippolito! How barbarous was I To leave my Boy! Hippolito! Hip. Here, here. Now Madam fear not, you are safe: Jul. What is become Sir, of those Gentlemen? Gons. Madam, They all went several ways; not like To meet. Jul. What will become of me! Gons. 'Tis late, And I a stranger in the Town: yet all Your dangers shall be mine. Jul. You'r noble, Sir. Gons. I'l pawn the hopes of all my Love, to see You safe. Jul. Who ere your Mistress be, she has My curses if, she prove not Kind. Ang. And mine. Hip. My Sister will repent her when she knows For whom she makes that Wish; but I'l say nothing Till Day discovers it: A Door opens, [Aside. I hope it is some Inn. [A Door opens, at which a Servant appears. Ang. Friend, can you Lodge us here? Serv. Yes Friend, we can: Jul. How shall we be dispos'd? Serv. As Nature would; The Gentleman and you: I have a rule, That when a Man and Woman ask for Lodging They are ever Husband and Wife. Jul. Rude and Unmanner'd: Gons. Sir, this Lady must be Lodged apart: Serv. Then the two Boys that are good for nothing But one another, they shall go together. Ang. Lye with a Man? sweet Heav'n defend me! Hip. Alas, friend, I ever lye alone. Serv. Then to save trouble, Sir, because 'tis late One of the Youths shall be dispos'd with you. Ang. Who I! not for the World. Hip. Neither of us; for though I would not Lodge with you My self; I never can indure he should. Ang. Why then, to end the difference, if you please I and that Lady will be Bed-fellows; Hip. No, She and I will Lodge together rather. Serv. You are sweet Youths indeed; not for the World You would not Lodge with Men! none but the Lady Would serve your turn. Ang. Alas I had forgot I am a Boy; I am so lately one. [Aside. Serv. Well, well; all shall be Lodg'd apart. Gons. to Hip. I did not think you Harbour'd wanton thoughts: So young, so Bad! Hip. I can make no defence But must be sham'd by my own Innocence. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act the Second. Enter Gonsalvo, Hippolito, Amideo at a distance. The Scene is a Chamber. Gons. Hippolito, what is this pretty Youth That follows us? Hip. I know not much of him: Handsome you see, and of a gracefull Fashion; Of noble Blood, he says, and I believe him; But in some deep Distress; he'l tell no more, And I could cry for that which he has told, So much I pity him. Gons. My pretty Youth; Would I could do thee any Service. Ang. Sir, The greatest you can do me, is accepting mine. Hip. How's this? me-thinks already I begin To hate this Boy, whom but ev'n now I moan'd. You serve my Master? Do you think I cannot Perform all Duties of a Servant better And with more care than you? Ang. Better you may, But never with more care: Heav'n which is serv'd with Angels, yet admits Poor man to pay his Duty, and receives it. Hip. Mark but, my Lord, how ill behav'd a Youth, How very ugly, what a Dwarf he is. Ang. My Lord, I yet am Young enough to grow, And 'tis the commendation of a Boy That he is little. [Cries. Gons. Prithee do not cry; Hippolito, 'twas but just now you prais'd him, And are you chang'd so soon? Hip. On better View. Gons. What is your Name, sweet heart. Hip. Sweet heart! since I Have serv'd you, you ne'r call'd me so. Ang. O, ever, Ever call me by that kind name, I'l own No other, because I would still have that. Hip. He told me, Sir, his name was Amideo, Pray call him by't. Gons. Come, I'l employ you both; Reach me my Belt, and help to put it on. Amid. I run my Lord. Hip. You run? it is my Office. They both take it up, and strive for it; Hippolito gets it, and puts it on. Amid. Look you, my Lord, he puts it on so awkardly; [Crying. The Sword does not sit right. Hip. Why, where's the fault? Amid. I know not that; but I am sure 'tis wrong. Gons. The fault is plain, 'tis put on the wrong Shoulder. Hip. That cannot be, I look'd on Amideo's, And hung it on that Shoulder his is on. Amid. Then I doubt mine is so. Gons. It is indeed: You'r both good Boys, and both will learn in time: Hippolito, go you and bring me word, Whether that Lady we brought in last Night Be willing to receive a Visit from me. Hip. Now Amideo, since you are so forward To do all Service, you shall to the Lady. Amid. No, I'l stay with my Master, he bid you. Hip. It Mads me to the heart to leave him here: But I will be reveng'd. [Aside. My Lord, I beg You would not trust this Boy with any thing Till my return; pray know him better first. [Exit Hippolito. Gons. 'Twas my unhappiness to meet this Lady Last night; because it ruin'd my design Of walking by the House of Rodorick: Who knows but through some Window I had spy'd Fair Julia's shaddow passing by the Glass; Or if some others, I would think it hers; Or if not any, yet to see the place Where Julia Lives: O Heav'n, how small a blessing Will serve to make despairing Lovers happy! Amid. Unhappy Angellina, thou art lost: Thy Lord loves Julia. [Aside. Enter Hippolito, and Julia. Jul. âWhere is thy Master? I long to give him my acknowledgments For my own safety, and my Brothers both. Ha! Is it he? [Looks. Gons. Can it be Julia? Could Night so far disguise her from my Knowledge! Jul. I would not think thee him I see thou art: Prithee disown thy Self in pity to me: Why should I be oblig'd by one I hate? Gons. I could say something in my own defence; But it were half a Crime to plead my cause When you would have me Guilty. Amid. How I fear The sweetness of those words will move her pity: I'm sure they would do mine. Gons. You took me for a Robber, but so farr I am from that.â Jul. O prithee be one still, That I may know some cause for my Aversion. Gons. I freed you from them, and more gladly did it;â Jul. Be what thou wilt, 'tis how too late to tell me: The Blackness of that Image I first fancy'd, Has so Infected me, I still must hate thee. Hip. Though (if she Loves him) all my hopes are ruin'd, It makes me Mad to see her thus unkind. [Aside. Madam, what see you in this Gentleman, Deserves your scorn, or hatred; Love him, or Expect just Heav'n should strangely punish you. Gons. No more: what ere she does is best; and if You would be mine, you must like me submit Without dispute. Hip. How can I love you, Sir, and suffer this? She has forgot that which last Night you did In her defence. Jul. O call that Night again; Pitch her with all her Darkness round; then set me In some farr Desart, hemm'd with Mountain Wolves To howl about me: This I would indure, And more, to Cancel my Obligements to him. Gons. You owe me nothing, Madam, if you do I make it Void; and only ask your leave To love you still; for to be Lov'd again I never hope. Jul. If that will clear my Debt, enjoy thy wish; Love me, and long, and Desperately love me. I hope thou wilt, that I may Plague thee more: Mean time take from me that Detested object; Conveigh thy much loath'd Person from my Sight. Gons. Madam, you are Obey'd. Hippolito, and Amideo, wait Upon fair Julia; Look upon her for me With dying Eyes, but do not Speak one word In my behalf; for to disquiet her, Ev'n happiness it self were bought too dear. [Goes farther off, towards the end of the Stage. My passion swells too high: And like a Vessel struggling in a Storm, Requires more hands than one to Steer her upright; I'l find her Brother out. [Exit Gonsalvo. Jul. That Boy, I see he trusts above the other: He has a strange resemblance with a Face That I have seen, but when, or where, I know not. I'l watch till they are parted; then perhaps I may corrupt that little one to free me. [Aside. [Exit Julia. Amid. Sweet Hippolito, let me speak with you; Hip. What would you with me? Amid. Nay, you are so fierce; By all that's good I love and honour you. And would you do but one poor thing I'l ask you, In all things else you ever shall command me. Look you, Hippolito, here's Gold, and Jewels, These may be yours. Hip. To what end dost thou show These trifles to me? or how cam'st thou by them? Not honestly, I fear. Amid. I swear I did: And you shall have 'um; but you always press Before me in my Masters service so:â Hip. And always will. Amid. But dear Hippolito, Why will you not give way, that I may be First in his favour, and be still imploy'd? Why do you Frown? 'tis not for gain I ask it; What ever he shall give me shall be yours, Except it be some Toy, you would not care for, Which I should keep for his dear sake that gave it. Hip. If thou wouldst offer both the Indies to me, The Eastern Quarries, and the Western Mines, They should not Buy one look, one gentle smile Of his from me: assure thy Soul they should not, I hate thee so. Amid. Henceforth I'l hate you worse. But yet there is a Woman whom he Loves, A certain Julia, who will steal his heart From both of us; wee'l joyn at least against The common Enemy: Hip. Why does he fear my Lord should love a Woman? The passion of this Boy is so like mine That it amazes me. Enter a Servant. Piet. Young Gentleman, Your Master calls for you. Hip. I'l think upon't.â [Exit Hippolito, cum Pietro. Enter Julia to Amideo. Jul. Now is the time, he is alone. Amid. Here comes The Saint my Lord adores; Love, pardon me The fault I must commit. Jul. Fair Youth, I am A Suitor to you. Amid. So am I to you. Jul. You see me here a Pris'ner. Amid. My request Is, I may set you free; make haste sweet Madam: Which way would you go? Jul. To the next Religious House. Amid. Here through the Garden, Madam; How I commend your holy Resolution! Exeunt ambo. Enter Don Manuel in the Streets, and a Servant with him. Man. Angellina fled to a Monastery say you? Serv. So 'tis giv'n out: I could not see her Woman: But for your Sister, what you heard is true: I saw her at the Inn: They told me she was brought in late last Night, By a young Cavalier they show'd me there. Man. This must be he that Rescu'd me: What would I give to see him. Serv. Fortune is Obedient to your wishes; He was coming To find out you; I waited on him to The turning of the Street; and stept before To tell you of it. Man. You o'r-joy me. Serv. This, Sir, is he.â Enter Gonsalvo. Don Manuel is running to Embrace him, and stops. Man. âThe Captain of the Robbers! Gons. As such indeed you promis'd me your Sister. Man. I promis'd all the int'rest I should have, Because I thought before you came to claim it, A Husbands right would take my Title from me. Gons. I come to see if any Manly virtue Can dwell with falshood: Draw, thou'st injur'd me. Man. You say already I have done you wrong, And yet would have me right you by a greater. Gons. Poor abject thing! Man. Who doubts another's Courage Wants it himself; but I who know my own, Will not receive a Law from you to Fight, Or to forbear: for then I grant your Courage To master mine, when I am forc'd to do What of my self I would not. Gons. Your reason? Man. You sav'd my Life. Gons. I'l quit that Debt to be In a capacity of forcing you To keep your promise with me; for I come To learn, your Sister is not yet dispos'd. Man. I've lost all privilege to defend my Life; And if you take it now, 'tis no new Conquest; Like Fish, first taken in a River, then Bestow'd in Ponds to catch a second time. Gons. Mark but how partially you plead your cause, Pretending breach of honour if you Fight; Yet think it none to Violate your word. Man. I cannot give my Sister to a Robber. Gons. You shall not; I am none, but Born of Blood As noble as your Self; my Fortunes, equal At least with Yours; my Reputation, yet I think unstain'd. Man. I wish, Sir, it may prove so; I never had so strong an Inclination To believe any Man as you:âbut yet.â Gons. All things shall be so clear, there shall be left No room for any scruple: I was Born In Sevil, of the best House in that City; My name Gonsalvo de Peralta: being A younger Brother, 'twas my Uncles care To take me with him in a Voyage to The Indies, where since Dying, he has left me A Fortune not Contemptible; returning From thence with all my Wealth in the Plate-fleet, A furious Storm almost within the Port Of Sevil, took us, scatter'd all the Navy: My Ship, by the unruly Tempest born Quite through the Streights, as far as Barcellona; There first cast Anchor; there I stept Ashore: Three Days I staid, in which small time I made A little Love, which Vanish'd as it came. Man. But were you not Ingag'd to her your Courted? Gons. Upon my Honour, no; what might have been I cannot tell: But ere I could repair My beaten Ship, or take fresh Water in, One night, when there by chance I lay Aboard, A Wind tore up my Anchor from the bottom, And with that Violence it brought me thither; Has thrown me in this Port:â Man. But yet our meeting in the Wood was strange. Gons. For that I'l satisfie you as we walk. Enter Hippolito. Hip. O Sir, how glad I am to find youâ [Whispers. Man. That Boy I have seen some where, or one like him, But where, I cannot call to mind:â Hip. I found it out, and got before 'um.â And here they are.â Enter Amideo, and Julia. Man. My Sister! as I could have wish'd it:â Amid. O! we are caught? Jul. I did expect as much: Fortune has not forgot that I am Julia: Man. Sister, I'm glad you'r happily return'd; 'Twas kindly done of you thus to prevent The trouble of my search. Jul. I would not have you Mistake my Love to Rodorick so much, To think I meant to fall into your hands. My purpose is for the next Nunnery; There I'l pray for you: So farewell. Man. Stay, Julia you must go with me. Jul. Lead, lead; You think I am your Pris'ner now:â Gons. If you will needs to a Religious house, Leave that fair Face behind; a worse will serve To spoil with Watching, and with Fasting there. Man. 'Prithee no more of this; the only way To make her happy is to force it on her. Julia, prepare your self strait to be Married: Jul. To whom? Man. You see your Bridegroom: and you know My Fathers will, who with his Dying breath Commanded, you should pay as strict Obedience To me, as formerly to him: if not, Your Dowry is at my dispose. Jul. O would The loss of that dispense with Duty in me, How gladly would I suffer it! and yet If I durst question it, me-thinks 'tis hard! What right have Parents over Children, more Than Birds have o'r their Young; yet they impose No rich Plum'd Mistriss on their Feather'd Sons; But leave their Love, more open yet and free Than all the Fields of Air, their spacious Birth-right. [Gonsalvo seems to beg Manuel not to be harsh. Man. Nay, good Gonsalvo trouble not your self, There is no other way, when 'tis once done She'l thank me for't. Jul. I ne'r expected other usage from you; A kind Brother you have been to me, And to my Sister: you have sent they say To Barcellona, that my Aunt should force her To marry the old Don you brought her; Hip. Who could! that once had seen Gonsalvo's Face? Alas she little thinks I am so near!â [Aside. Man. Mind not what she says;â A word with youâ [To Gonsalvo. Amid. Don Manuel eyes me strangely; the best is He never saw me yet but at a distance: My Brothers Jealousie (who ne'r intended I should be his) restrain'd our neer Converse. (Aside. Jul. My pretty Youth, I am inforc'd to trust thee [To Amid. With my most neer concerns; Friend I have none, If thou deny'st to help me. Amid. Any thing To break your Marriage with my Master. Jul. Go to Rodorick, and tell him my condition: But tell it him as from thy self, not me. Amid. That you are forc'd to Marry. Jul. But do not ask him To succour me; if of himself he will not: I scorn a Love that must be taught its Duty. Man. What Youth is that? I mean the little one? Gons. I took him up last Night. Man. A sweet fac'd Boy, I like him strangely: would you part with him? Amid. Alas, Sir, I am good for no Body But for my Master. Hip. Sir, I'l do your Errand Another time for letting Julia go. [To Amideo. Man. Come, Sir; Gons. I beg your pardon for a moment, I'l but dispatch some business in my Ship, And wait you presently. Man. Wee'l go before. I'l make sure Rodorick shall never have her; And 'tis at least some Pleasure to destroy His happiness, who ruin'd first my Joy. Exeunt all but Gonsalvo; who before he goes, whispers Hippolito. Gons. Against her will fair Julia to possess, Is not t'enjoy but Ravish happiness: Yet Women pardon force, because they find The Violence of Love is still most kind: Just like the Plots of well built Comedies, Which then please most, when most they do surprize: But yet constraint Love's noblest end destroys, Whose highest Joy is in anothers Joys: Where Passion rules, how weak does Reason prove! I yield my Cause, but cannot yield my Love. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act the Third. The Scene a great Room in Don Manuels House. Hippolito Solus. My Master bid me speak for him to Julia: Hard fate that I am made a confident Against my Self;â Yet though unwillingly I took the Office, I would perform it well: But how can I Prove lucky to his Love, who to my own Am so unfortunate! He trusts his passion Like him that Ventures all his Stock at once On an unlucky hand: Enter Amideo. Amid. Where is the Lady Julia? Hip. What new Treason Against my Masters Love have you contriv'd With her? Amid. I shall not render you account. Enter Julia. Jul. I sent for him; yet if he comes there's danger; Yet if he does not, I for ever lose him. What can I wish? and yet I wish him here! Only to take the care of me from me. Weary with sitting out a Losing hand, 'Twill be some ease to see another Play it. Yesterday I refus'd to Marry him, To day I run into his Arms unask'd; Like a mild Prince inchroach'd upon by Rebels, Love yielded much, till Honour ask'd for all. [Sees Hippolito. How now, where's Rodorick? (sees Amideo)âI mean Gonsalvo? Hip. You would do well to meet him:â Amid. Meet him! you shall not do't: I'l throw my self Like a young fawning Spaniel in your way So often, you shall never move a step But you shall tread on me. Jul. You need not beg me: I would as soon meet a Serene, as see him. Hip. His sweetness for those Frowns no subject finds: Seas are the Field of Combat for the Winds: But when they sweep along some flowry Coast, Their wings move Mildly, and their Rage is lost. Jul. 'Tis that which makes me more unfortunate: Because his sweetness must upbraid my hate. The wounds of Fortune touch me not so near; I can my Fate, but not his Virtue bear. For my disdain with my esteem is rais'd; He most is hated when he most is prais'd: Such an esteem, as like a Storm appears, Which rises but to Ship-wrack what it bears. Hip. Infection dwells upon my Kindness sure, Since it destroys ev'n those whom it would cure. [Cries, and Exit Hippolito. Amid. Still weep Hippolito; to me thy Tears Are soveraign, as those drops the Balm-tree sweats.â âBut, Madam, are you sure your shall not love him! I still fear.â Jul. Thy fear will never let thee be a Man. Amid. Indeed I think it won't. Jul. We are now Alone; What news from Rodorick? Amid. Madam, he beggs you not to fear; He has A way, which when you think all desperate Will set you free. Jul. If not, I will not Live A moment after it. Amid. Why! there's some comfort. Jul. I strongly wish, for what I faintly hope: Like the Day-dreams of melancholy Men, I think and think on things impossible, Yet love to wander in that Golden maze. Enter Don Manuel, Hippolito, and Company. Amid. Madam, your Brother's here. Man. Where is the Bridegroom? Hip. Not yet return'd, Sir, from his Ship. Man. Sister, all this good Company is met To give you Joy. Jul. While I am compass'd round With mirth, my Soul lies hid in shades of Grief, Whence, like the Bird of Night, with half shut Eyes She peeps, and sickens at the sight of Day. [Aside. Enter Servant. Serv. Sir, some Gentlemen and Ladies are without, Who to do honour to this Wedding come To present a Masque. Man. 'Tis well; desire 'um They would leave out the words, and fall to Dancing; The Poetry of the Foot takes most of late: Serv. The Poet, Sir, will take that very ill, He's at the Door, with th'Argument o'th' Masque In Verse. Man. Which of the Wits is it that made it? Serv. None of the Wits, Sir; 'tis one of the Poets. Man. What subject has he chose. Serv. The Rape of Proserpine. Enter Gonsalvo. Man. Welcome, welcome, you have been long expected. Gons. I staid to see th'Unlading of some Rarities Which are within:â Madam, your pardon that I was so long absent. Jul. You need not ask it for your absence, Sir. Gons. Still cruel, Julia:â Jul. The danger's here, and Rodorick not here: I am not griev'd to Dye; but I am griev'd To think him false. [Aside. Man. Bid 'um begin. The Musique Plays. A Cupid descends in swift Motion, and Speaks these Verses. Cup. Thy Conquests, Proserpine, have stretch'd too far; Amidst Heav'ns peace thy Beauty makes a War: For when, last Night, I to Joves Pallace went, (The brightest part of all the Firmament) Instead of all those Gods, whose thick resort Fill'd up the presence of the Thund'rer's Court; There Jove and Juno all forsaken sate, Pensive, like Kings in their declining State: Yet (wanting Pow'r) they would preserve the show, By hearing Pray'rs from some few Men below: Mortals to Jove may their Devotions pay; The Gods themselves to Proserpine do Pray. To Sicily the Rival pow'rs resort; 'Tis Heav'n where ever Ceres keeps her Court. PhÅbus and Mercury are both at strife, The Courtliest of our Gods who want a Wife: But Venus, what ere Kindness she pretends, Yet, (like all Females, envious of their Friends,) Has, by my Aid, contriv'd a black design, The God of Hell should Ravish Proserpine: Beauties, beware; Venus will never bear Another Venus shining in her Sphere. After Cupids, Speech, Venus and Ceres descend in the slow Machines; Ceres drawn by Dragons, Venus by Swans. After them PhÅbus and Mercury descend in swift Motion. Then Cupid turns to Julia, and Speaks; Cup. The Rival Deities are come to woo A Proserpine, who must be found below: Would you (fair Nymph) become this happy hour, In name a Goddess as you are in pow'r, Then to this change the King of Shades will owe A fairer Proserpine than Heav'n can show. Julia, first whisper'd by Amideo, goes into the Dance, perform'd by Cupid, PhÅbus, Mercury, Ceres, Venus, Julia. Towards the end of the Dance, Rodorick in the Habit of Pluto, rises from below in a black Chariot all Flaming, and drawn by black Horses; he Ravishes Julia, who personated Proserpine, and as he is Carrying her away, his Vizard falls off: Hippolito first discovers him. Hip. A Rape, A Rape; 'tis Rodorick, 'tis Rodorick. Rod. Then I must have recourse to this:â [Draws. Jul. Oh Heav'ns. Don Manuel and Gonsalvo draw, and a Servant; the two that Acted PhÅbus and Mercury return to assist Rodorick, and are beat back by Manuel and a Servant, while Gonsalvo attacques Rodorick. Gons. Unloose thy hold, foul Villain; Rod. No, I'l grasp her Ev'n after Death. Jul. Spare him, or I'l Dye with him: Gons. Must Ravishes and Villains Live, while I In Vain implore her Mercy?â [Thrusts at him, and hurts Julia in the Arm. Jul. Oh, I am Murther'd! Gons. Wretched that I am What have I done? To what strange Punishment Will you condem this guilty Hand? and yet My Eyes were guilty first: for they could look On nothing else but you; and my Unlucky hand Too closely follow'd them!â Enter Manuel again. Man. The Pow'rs above are just that thou still Liv'st For me to Kill. Rod. You'l find no easie task on't Alone; come both together, I defie you: Curse on this Disguise, that has betray'd me Thus cheaply to my Death.â Man. Under a Devils shape thou could'st not be Disguis'd.â Jul. Then must he Dye? Yet I'l not bid my Rodorick farewell; For they take leave, who mean to be long absent. Gons. Hold Sir; I have had Blood enough already, And must not murder Julia again In him she loves: Live, Sir, and thank this Lady. Rod. Take my Life, and spare my Thanks. Man. Though you Forgive him, let me take my just Revenge. Gons. Leave that Distinction to our dull Divines; That ill I suffer to be done, I do. Hip. My heart bleeds Tears for him; to see his Virtue O'rcome so fatally against such Odds Of Fortune and of Love!â Man. Permit his Death, and Julia will be yours: Jul. Permit it not, and Julia will thank you. Gons. Who ere could think that one kind word from Julia Should be preferr'd to Julia her self! Could any Man think it a greater good To save a Rival, than possess a Mistress: Yet this I do; these are thy riddles Love. What Fortune gives me I my self Destroy; And feed my Virtue, but to starve my Joy. Honour sits on me like some heavy Armour, And with its stiff Defence incumbers me. And yet when I would put it off, it sticks Like Hercules his Shirt; heats me at once, And Poysons me!â Man. I find my self grow Calm by thy example; My panting Heart heaves less and less each Pulse; And all the boyling Spirits scatter from it. Since thou desir'st he should not Dye, he shall not Till I on Nobler terms can take his Life. Rod. The next turn my be Yours: Remember Julia, I ow'd this Danger to your Wilfulness; Once you might easily have been mine, and would not. [Exit Rodorick. Man. Lead out my Sister, Friend, her hurt's so small 'Twill scarce disturb the Ceremony: Ladies once more your pardons. [Leads out the Company, Exeunt. Manent Julia, Gonsalvo, Amideo: Gonsalvo offers his hand, Julia pulls back hers. Jul. This hand would rise in Blisters should'st thou touch it: My Rodorick's displeas'd with me, and thou Unlucky Man the cause; dare not so much As once to follow me.â [Exit Julia. Gons. Not follow her! alas she need not bid me! O how could I presume to take that hand To which mine prov'd so Fatal! Nay, if I might, Should I not fear to touch it? A Murd'rers touch would make it bleed afresh. Amid. I think, Sir, I could Kill her for your sake. Gons. Repent that word, or I shall hate thee strangely: Harsh words from her, like blows from angry Kings, Though they are meant Affronts, are construed Favours. Hip. Her Inclinations and Aversions Are both alike unjust; and both, I hope, Too violent to last, chear up your Self; For if I Live (I hope I shall not long) [Aside. She shall be yours. Amid. 'Twere much more Noble in him To make a Conquest of himself than her. She ne'r can merit him, and had'st not thou A mean low Soul, thou would'st not name her to him. Hip. Poor child, who would'st be Wise above thy Years, Why dost thou talk, like a Philosopher, Of conquering Love, who art not yet Grown up To try the force of any Manly passion? The sweetness of thy Mothers milk is yet: Within thy Veins, not sowr'd and turn'd by Love. Gons. Thou hast not Field enough in thy Young breast, To entertain such Storms to struggle in. Amid. Young as I am, I know the pow'r of Love; Its less Disquiets, and its greater Cares, And all that's in it, but the Happiness. Trust a Boys word, Sir, if you please, and take My Innocence for Wisdome; Leave this Lady; Cease to perswade you Self you are in Love, And you will soon be freed: Not that I wish A thing so noble as your Passion, lost To all the Sex: bestow it on some other; You'l find many as Fair, though none so Cruel. Would I could be a Lady for your sake. Hip. If I could be a Woman with a wish, You should not be without a Rival long. Amid. A Cedar of your Stature would not cause Much Jealousie. Hip. More than a Shrub of yours. Gons. How eagerly these Boys fall out for nothing! Tell me Hippolito, wert thou a Woman, Who would'st thou be? Hip. I would be Julia, Sir, Because you Love her. Amid. I would not be She, Because she Loves not you. Hip. True, Amideo: And therefore I would wish my self a Lady, Who I am sure does Infinitely love him. Amid. I hope that Lady has a Name:â Hip. She has; And she is call'd Honoria, Sister to This Julia, and bred up at Barcellona. Who loves him with a Flame so pure and noble, That did she know his Love to Julia, She would beg Julia to make him happy. Gons. This startles me! Amid. Oh Sir, believe him not; They Love not truly, who on any terms Can part with what they Love. Gons. I saw a Lady At Barcellona, of what Name I know not, Who next to Julia was the fairest Creature My Eyes did ere behold: but how cam'st thou To know her? Hip. Sir, some other time I'l tell you. Amid. It could not be Honoria whom you saw. For, Sir, she has a Face so very Ugly, That if she were a Saint for Holiness, Yet no Man would seek Virtue there. Hip. This is the lying'st Boy, Sir; I am sure He never saw Honoria; for her Face 'Tis not so bad to right any Man; None of the Wits have Libell'd it. Amid. Don Rodoricks Sister, Angellina, does So far exceed her in the Ornaments Of Wit and Beauty, though now hid from sight, That like the Sun (ev'n while Eclips'd) she casts A Yellowness upon all other Faces. Hip. I'l not say much of her; but only this, Don Manuel saw not with my Eyes, if e'r He Lov'd that Flanders shape, that Lump of Earth And Flegm together. Amid. You have often seen her. It seems by your Description of her Person: But I'l maintain on any Spanish ground, What ere she be, yet she is far more worthy To have my Lord her Servant, than Honoria. Hip. And I'l maintain Honoria's right against her In any part of all the World. Gons. You go Too far, to Quarrel on so slight a Ground. Hip. O pardon me, my Lord, it is not slight: I must confess I am so much concern'd I shall not beat it long. Amid. Nor I, assure you. Gons. I will believe what both of you have said, That Honoria, and Angellina Both equally are Fair. Amid. Why did you name Honoria first? Gons. And since you take their parts so eagerly, Henceforth I'l call you by those Ladies names: You, my Hippolito, shall be Honoria; And you, my Amidea, Angelina. Amid. Then all my Services, I wish, may make You kind to Angellina, for my sake. Hip. Put all my Merits on Honoria's score, And think no Maid could ever Love you more. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act the Fourth. Scene First. Manuel, Solus. Thus I provide for others Happiness, And lose my Own: 'Tis true, I cannot blame Thy hatred Angellina, but thy silence. Thy Brother's hatred made thine just; but yet 'Twas cruel in thee not to tell me so, Conquest is noble when an Heart stands out; But mine which yielded, how could'st thou betray? That heart of which thou could'st not be depriv'd, By any force or pow'r beside thy own; Like Empires to that Fatal height arriv'd, They must be Ruin'd by themselves alone. My guarded Freedome cannot be a prize To any scornfull Face a second time; For thy Idea like a Ghost would rise, And fright my Thoughts from such another Crime. Enter a Servant with a Letter. Man. From whom? 2 Ser. Sir, the Contents will soon resolve you. [He reads. Man. Tell Rodorick he has prevented me In my Design of sending to him first. I'l meet him Single at the time and place; But for my Friend tell him he must excuse me: I'l hazard no Man in my Quarrel, but [Exit Mess. My self alone:âWho's within there? Enter a Servant. Go call my Sister, and Gonsalvo hither. [Exit Servant. 'Twas push'd so far, that like two Armies, we Were drawn so closely up, we could not part Without ingagement:âBut they must not know it. Enter Julia, Gonsalvo, Amideo. I have some Business calls me hence, and know not When I shall return: But e'r I go, That pow'r I have by my Dead Fathers will Over my Sister, I bequeath to you: (To Gonsalvo. She and her Fortunes both be firmly Yours; And this when I Revoke, let Cowardise Blast all my Youth, and Treason taint my Age. Gons. Sir,â Man. Nay, good, no thanks, I cannot stay.â [Exit Manuel. Gons. There's something more than ordinary in this: Go Amideo, quickly follow him, And bring me word which way he takes. Amid. I go Sir. [Exit Amideo. [Julia Kneels. Gons. Madam, When you implore the Pow'rs divine, You have no Pray'rs, in which I will not joyn, Though made against my Self. [Kneels with her. Jul. âIn vain I sue, Unless my Vows maybe Conveigh'd by you. Gons. Conveigh'd by me?âMy ill success in Love Shews me too sure I have few Friends above. How can you fear your just desires to want? When the Gods pray, they both request and grant. Jul. Heav'n has resign'd my Fortune to your hand, If you, like Heav'n, th'Afflicted understand. Gons. The Language of th'Afflicted is not new; Too well I learnt it when I first saw you. Jul. In spight of me, you now command my Fate; And yet the Vanquish'd seeks the Victors hate: Ev'n in this low Submission, I declare, That had I Pow'r, I would renew the Warr. I'm forc'd to stoop, and 'twere too great a blow To bend my Pride, and to deny me too. Gons. You have my Heart; dispose it to your will; If not, you know the way to use it ill. Jul. Cruel to me, though Kind to your desert, My Brother gives my Person, not my Heart: And I have left no other means to sue, But to you only to be freed from you. Gons. From such a Sute how can you hope success, Which giv'n, destroys the Givers happiness? Jul. You think it equal you should not resign That pow'r you have; yet will not leave me mine: Yet on my will I have the Pow'r alone, And since you cannot move it, move your Own. Your Worth and Virtue my esteem may win, But Womens passions from themselves begin; Merit may be, but Force still is in vain. Gons. I would but Love you, not your Love constrain; And though your Brother left me to command, He plac'd his Thunder in a gentle hand. Jul. Your Favour from constraint has set me free, But that secures not my Felicity; Slaves, who, before, did cruel Masters serve, May fly to Desarts, and in Freedome starve. The noblest part of Liberty they loose, Who can but shun, and want the Pow'r to choose. Gons. O whither would your Fatal reasons move! You court my Kindness to destroy my Love. Jul. You have the Pow'r to make my Happiness, By giving that which you can ne'r possess: Gons. Give you to Rodorick? there wanted yet That Curse to make my Miseries compleat. Jul. Departing Misers bear a Nobler mind; They, when they can enjoy no more, are Kind: You, when your Love is Dying in despair, Yet want the Charity to make an Heir. Gons. Though hope be Dying, yet it is not Dead; And Dying people with small Food are fed. Jul. The greatest kindness Dying friends can have, Is to dispatch them when we cannot save. Gons. Those Dying people, could they Speak at all, That pity of their Friends would Murder call. For Men with Horrour dissolution meet; The Minutes, ev'n of painfull Life are sweet. Jul. But I'm by Pow'rfull inclination led; And Streams turn seldome to their Fountain head. Gons. No, 'tis a Tide which carries you away; And Tides may turn though they can never stay. Jul. Can you pretend to Love, and see my Grief Caus'd by your Self, yet give me no relief? Gons. Where's my Reward? Jul. The honour of the Flame. Gons. I loose the Substance then, to gain the Name. Jul. I do too much a Mistress's pow'r betray; Must Slaves be won by Courtship to Obey? Thy Disobedience does to Treason rise, Which thou, like Rebells, would'st with Love disguise. I'l Kill my Self, and if thou can'st deny To see me Happy, thou shalt see me Dye. Gons. O stay! I can with less Regret bequeath My love to Rodorick, than you to Death: And yet.â Jul. What new Objections can you find? Gons. But are you sure you never shall be Kind? Jul. Never. Gons. What never? Jul. Never to remove. Gons. Oh fatal Never to Souls damn'd in Love! Jul. Lead me to Rodorick. Gons. If it must be so! Jul. Here, take me Hand, swear on it thou wilt go. He kisses her Hand. Gons. Oh balmy Sweetness! but 'tis lost to me, Like Food upon a Wretch condemn'd to Dye: Another, and I Vow to go:âone more; If I Swear often I shall be forswore. Others against their Wills may haste their Fate; I only Toyl to be unfortunate: More my own Foe than all my Stars could prove; They give her Person, but I give her Love. I must not trust my Self.âHippolito. Enter Hippolito. Hip. My Lord! Gons. Quickly go find Don Rodorick out: Tell him the Lady Julia will be Walking On the broad Rock that lies beside the Port, And there expects to see him instantly. In the mean time I'l call for Amideo. Jul. You'l keep your promise to Don Rodorick. Gons. Madam, Since you bring Death I welcome it; But to his Fortune not his Love submit.â [Exit Gonsalvo. Hip. I dare not ask what I too Fain would hear: But, like a tender Mother, Hope and Fear; My equal Twins, my equal care I make; [Aside. And keep Hope quiet least that Fear should wake. [Exit Hippolito. Jul. So, now I'm firmly at my own Dispose; And all the Lets, my Virtue cans'd, remov'd: Now Rodorick I come.â Enter Gonsalvo again. Gons. Madam, My Boy's not yet return'd. Jul. No matter, wee'l not stay for him. Gons. Pray make not too much haste. [Exeunt Julia, Gonsalvo. Scene the Second. Enter Don Rodorick, and Servant. Rod. Have you bespoke a Vessel as I bid you? 1 Serv. I have done better; for I have employ'd Some, whom I know, this Day to seize a Ship; Which they have done; Clapping the Men within her All under Hatches, with such speed and silence, That though she Rides at Anchor in the Port Among the rest, the Change is not discover'd. Rod. Let my best Goods and Jewels be Embarqued With secrecy: wee'l put to Sea this Night. Have you yet found my Sister, or her Woman? Serv. Neither Sir; but in all probability She is with Manuel. Rod. Would God the meanest Man in Alicante Had Angellina rather than Don Manuel: I never can forgive, much less forget How he (the younger Souldier) was preferr'd To that Command of Horse which was my due; Serv. And after that, by force Disseiz'd you of Your Quarters.â Rod. Should I meet him sev'n Years hence At th'Altar, I would Kill him there:âI had Forgot to tell you the Design we had; To carry Julia by force away Will now be needless; Shee'l come to the Rock To see me, you unseen shall stand behind, And carry her into the Vessel. Serv. Shall I not help you to dispatch Don Manuel? Rod. I neither doubt my Valour, nor my Fortune: But if I Dye, revenge me: presently About your business; I must to the Rock For fear I come too late. [Exeunt severally. Scene the Third. Through a Rock is discover'd a Navy of Ships Riding at a distance. Enter Amideo. Amid. Thus far unseen by Manuel, I have trac'd him: He can be gone no farther than the Walk Behind the Rock; I'l back and tell my Master. Enter Hippolito at the other end. Hip. This is the place where Rod'rick must expect His Julia:âHow! Amideo here! Amid. Hippolito! Hip. This were so fit a time For my Revenge; had I the Courage, now: My Heart swells at him, and my Breath grows short, But whether Fear or Anger choaks it up, I cannot tell. Amid. He looks so Ghastfully, Would I were past him; yet I fear to try it, Because my mind mis-gives me he will stop me. B' your leave Hippolito. Hip. Whether so fast? Amid. You'l not presume to hinder my Lords business? He shall know it. Hip. I'l make you sure, before, For telling any Tales: Do you remember Since you defended Angellina's Beauty Against Honoria's; nay, and would maintain it. Amid. And so I will do still; (I must feign Courage [Aside. There is no other way.) Hip. I'l so revenge That Injury (if my Heart fails me not.) Amid. Come, confess truly, for I know it fails you. What would you give to avoid Fighting now? Hip. No, 'tis your Heart that fails. Amid. I scorn the Danger; Yet, what Compassion on your Youth might do I cannot tell; and therefore do not work Upon my Pity; for I feel already My stout Heart melts. Hip. Oh! Are you thereabout? Now I am sure you fear; and you shall Fight. Amid. I will not Fight. Hip. Confess then Angellina Is not so Fair as is Honoria: Amid. I do confess; now are you satisfied? Hip. There's more behind; confess her not so worthy To be belov'd; nor to possess Gonsalvo As Fair Honoria is. Amid. That's somewhat hard: Hip. But you must do't or Dye. Amid. Well, Life is sweet; She's not so worthy: now let me be gone. Hip. No, never to my Master; Swear to quit His Service, and no more to see his Face. Amid. I fain would save my Life, but that which you Propose, is but another Name to Dye. I cannot Live without my Master's Sight. Hip. Then you must Fight with me for him. Amid. I would Do any thing with you, but Fighting for him. Hip. Nothing but what will serve. Amid. Lay by our Swords And I'l scratch with you for him. Hip. That's not Manly. Amid. Well, since it must be so, I'l Fight:âUnbutton. [Hippolito unbuttons slowly. How many Buttons has he? I'l be one Behind him still. [Aside. [Unbuttons one by one after him. Hippolito makes more haste. You are so Prodigal; if you Lov'd my Master You would not tear his Doubtlet so:âHow's this! Two swelling Breasts! a Woman, and my Rival! The Stings of Jealousie have giv'n me Courage Which Nature never gave me: Come on thou vile Dissembler of thy Sex; Expect no mercy; either thou or I Must Dye upon this Spot: Now for Gonsalvo.â Sa.âSa.â Hip. This courage is not counterfeit; Ah me! What shall I do? for pity, gentle Boy.â Amid. No pity; such a Cause as ours Can neither give nor take it: If thou yield'st I will not spare thee, therefore Fight it out. [Tears open his Doublet. Hip. Death to my Hopes! a Woman! and so rare A Beauty that my Lord must needs Doat on her. I should my Self if I had been a Man: But as I am, her Eyes shoot Death at me. Amid. Come, have you said your Pray'rs? Hip. For thy Confusion Thou Ravenous Harpy, with an Angel's face; Thou art Discover'd, thou too Charming Rival; I'l be Reveng'd upon those fatal Eyes. Amid. I'l tear out thine. Hip. I'l bite out hungry Morsels From those plump Cheeks, but I will make 'um thinner. Amid. I'd beat thee to the Blackness of a Moor, But that the Features of thy Face are such; Such Damnable, invincible good Features, That as an Ethiop thou would'st still be Lov'd. Hip. I'l quite unbend that black Bow o'r thine Eyes; I'l Murther thee, and Julia shall have him, Rather than thou. Amid. I'l Kill both thee and her Rather than any one but I shall have him. Hip. Come on, thou Witch. Amid. Have at thy Heart thou Syren. They draw, and Fight awkardly, not coming near one another. Amid. I think I paid you there. Hip. O stay a little And tell me in what Corner of thy Heart Gonsalvo lies, that I may spare that place: Amid. He lies in the last drop of all my Blood, And never will come out, but with my Soul. Hip. Come, come, we Dally; Would one of us were Dead, no matter which. [They Fight nearer. Enter Don Manuel. Man. The pretty Boys that serve Gonsalvo, Fighting! I come in time to save the Life of one. Hippolito gets Amideo down in Closing: Manuel takes away the Swords. Hip. For goodness sake hinder not my Revenge. Amid. The Noble Manuel has sav'd my Life: Heav'ns, how unjustly have I hated him! [Aside. Man. What is it, gentle Youths that moves you thus? I cannot tell what Causes you may find; But trust me, all the World, in so much Sweetness, Would be to seek where to begin a Quarrel: You seem the little Cupids in the Song, Contending for the Honey-bagg. Hip. 'Tis well You'r come; you may prevent a greater mischief: Here 'tis Gonsalvo has appointed Rodorick.â Man. To Fight? Hip. What's worse; to give your Sister to him. Won by her Tears, he means to leave her free, And to redeem her Misery with his: At least I so Conjecture. Man. 'Tis a doubtfull Problem; either he Loves her Violently, Or not at all. Amid. You have betray'd my Master:â [To Hippolito, Aside. Hip. If I have Injur'd you, I mean to give you The satisfaction of a Gentlewoman.â Enter Gonsalvo, and Julia. Man. Oh they are here; now I shall be resolv'd. Jul. My Brother Manuel! what Fortune's this! Man. I'm glad I have prevented you. Gons. With what Variety my Fate torments me still! Never was Man so Dragg'd along by Virtue; But I must follow her. Jul. Noble Gonsalvo, Protect me from my Brother. Gons. Tell me, Sir, When you bestow'd your Sister on me, did not You give her freely up to my dispose? Man. 'Tis true, I did; but never with intent You should restore her to my Enemy. Gons. 'Tis past; 'tis done: She undermin'd my Soul With tears; as Banks are Sapp'd away by streams. Man. I wonder what strange Blessing she expects From the harsh Nature of this Rodorick; A Man made up of Malice and Revenge. Jul. If I possess him I may be unhappy; But if I loose him I am surely so. Had you a Friend so desperately Sick, That all Physitians had forsook his Cure; All Scorch'd without, and all Parch'd up within, The Moisture that maintain'd consuming Nature Lick'd up, and in a Feaver fry'd away; Could you behold him Beg, with Dying eyes A glass of Water, and refuse it him Because you knew it Ill for his Disease? When he would Dye without it, How could you Deny to make his Death more easie to him? Man. Talk not to me of Love, when Honour suffers, The Boys will Hiss at me. Gons. I suffer most Had there been choice, what would I not have chose? To save my Honour I my Love must lose: But promises once made are past debate, And Truth's of more necessity than Fate. Man. I scarce can think your Promise absolute; There might some way be thought on, if you would To keep both her, and it. Gons. No, no, my promise was no trick of State: I meant to be made truly Wretched first, And then to Dye; and I'l perform them both. Man. Then that Revenge I meant on Rodorick I'l take on you. [Draws. Gons. âI draw with such Regret As Merchants throw their Wealth into the Sea, To save their sinking Vessels from a Wrack. Man. I find I cannot lift my Hand against thee: Do what thou wilt; but let not me behold it. Goes off a little way. I'l cut this Gordian Knot I cannot loose: To keep his promise, Rodorick shall have her, But I'l return and rescue her by force; Then giving back what he so Franckly gave, At once my Honour and his Love I'l save. [Exit Manuel. Enter Rodorick. Rod. How! Julia brought by him?âWho sent for me? Gons. 'Twas I. Rod. I know your business then; 'tis Fighting. Gons. You'r mistaken; 'tis something that I fear: Rod. What is't? Gons. Why,â'twill not out: Here take her; And deserve her; but no thanks; For fear I should consider what I give, And call it back.â Jul. O my dear Rodorick! Gons. O cruel Julia! For pity shew not all your Joy before me; Stifle some part of it one Minute longer Till I am Dead. Jul. My Rodorick shall know He ows his Julia to you; thank him, Love; In faith I take it Ill you are so slow. Rod. You know he has forbid me; and beside Hee'l take it better from your Mouth than mine; All that you do must needs be pleasing to him: Jul. Still sullen and unkind! Rod. Why then in short, I do not understand the benefit: Gons. Not, to have Julia in thy free Possession? Rod. Not brought by you; not of another's leaving: Jul. Speak softly Rodorick: let not these hear thee; But spare my Shame for the ill Choice I made In loving thee. Rod. I will speak Loud, and tell thee, Thou com'st, all Cloy'd and tyr'd with his Embraces, To profer thy pall'd Love to me: his Kisses Do yet bedew thy Lips; the very Print His Arms made round thy Body, yet remains. Gons. O Barb'rous Jealousie! Jul. 'Tis an harsh word, I am too Pure for thee; but yet I Love thee: Offers to take his Hand. Rod. Away, foul Impudence. Gons. Madam, you wrong Your Virtue thus to clear it by Submission. Jul. Whence grows this boldness, Sir? did I ask you To be my Champion? Rod. He chose to be your Friend, and not your Husband: Left that Dull part of Dignity to me; As often the worst Actors play the Kings. Jul. This Jealousie is but excess of Passion, Which grows up, Wild, in every Lovers breast; But changes Kind when Planted in an Husband. Rod. Well, what I am, I am; and what I will be, When you are mine, my Pleasure shall determine. I will receive no Law from any Man. Jul. This strange unkindness of my Rodorick, I owe to thee, and thy unlucky Love; Henceforth go Lock it up within thy Breast; 'Tis only harmless while it is conceal'd, But opened spreads Infection like a Vault. Go, and my Curse go with thee:â Gons. I cannot go till I behold you Happy:â âHere, Rodorick, receive her on thy Knees; Use her with that respect which thou would'st pay Thy Guardian Angel if he could be seen. âDo not provoke my Anger by refusing.â I'l watch thy least Offence to her; each Word, Nay, every sullen Look:â And as the Devils, who are Damn'd to Torments, Yet have the Guilty Souls their Slaves to punish: So under me, while I am Wretched, thou Shalt be Tormented.â Rod. Would'st thou make me the Tenant of thy Lust; To Toyl, and for my Labour take the Dreggs, The Juicy Vintage being left for thee? No; She's an Infamous, leud Prostitute; I loath her at my Soul; Gons. I can forbear No longer; Swallow down thy Lye, foul Villain. [They Fight, off the Stage, Exeunt. Jul. Help, Help! Amid. Here is that Witch whose fatal Beauty Began the Mischief; She shall pay for all. [Goes to Kill Julia. Hip. I hate her for it more than thou can'st do; But cannot see her Dye my Master loves. [Goes between with her Sword. Enter Gonsalvo, following Rodorick; who Falls. Rod. So, now I am at rest:â I feel Death rising higher still, and higher, Within my Bosom; every Breath I fetch Shuts up my Life within a shorter compass: And like the Vanishing sound of Bells, grows less And less each Pulse, till it be lost in Air. [Swoons away. Gons. Down at your Feet, much injur'd Innocence, I lay that Sword, whichâ Jul. Take it up again, It has not done its work till I am Kill'd: For ever, ever, thou hast Robb'd me of That Man, that only Man, whom I could Love: Dost thou thus Court thy Mistress? thus Oblige her? All thy Obligements have been Fatal yet, Yet the most Fatal now would most Oblige me. Kill me:âyet I am Kill'd before in him. I lye there on the Ground; Cold, cold, and Pale: That Death I Dye in Rodorick is far More pleasant than that Life I live in Julia.â âSee how he standsâwhen he is bid dispatch me! How Dull! how Spiritless! that Sloath possest Thee not, when thou didst Kill my Rodorick. Gons. I'm too Unlucky to Converse with Men: I'l pack together all my Mischiefs up, Gather with care each little remnant of 'um That none of 'um be left behind: Thus loaded, Fly to some Desart, and there let them loose, Where they may never prey upon Mankind. But you may make my Journey shorter:âTake This Sword; 'twill show you how:â Jul. I'l gladly set you on your way:â [Takes his Sword. Enter three of Rodoricks Servants. 1. Make haste; He's now Unarm'd; we may with ease Revenge my Masters Death. Jul. Now these shall do it. Gons. I'l Dye by none but you.â Hip. O here, take my Sword, Sir. Amid. He shall have mine. [Both give their Swords to Gonsalvo. Enter Manuel. Man. Think not of Death, Wee'l Live and Conquer. [They beat them off. Man. These Fellows, though beat off, will strait return With more; we must make haste to save our selves. Hip. 'Tis far to th'Town, And ere you reach it you will be Discover'd. Gons. My Life's a burden to me, were not Julia's Concern'd; but as it is, she being present Will be found accessary to his Death. Man. See where a Vessel lies, not far from Shore; And near at hand a Boat belonging to her; Let's haste Aboard, and what with Pray'rs and Gifts Buy our Concealment there:âCome Julia. Gons. Alas, She Swoons away upon the Body. Man. The Night grows on apace; Wee'l take her in Our Arms and bear her hence. Exeunt Gonsalvo, and the Boys with Manuel, carrying Julia. The Servants enter again. 1. They are all gone, we may return with Safety: Help me to bear the Body to the Town. 2. He Stirs, and Breaths a little; there may be Some hope. 3. The Town's far off, and th'Evening cold, Let's carry him to th'Ship. 1. Hast then away: Things once resolv'd are ruin'd by Delay. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act the Fifth. Enter a Pyrat, and the Captain. The Scene lying in a Carrack. Pyr. Welcome a Ship-board, Captain, you staid long: Capt. No longer than was necessary for shifting Trades; To change me from a Robber to a Pyrat. Pyr. There's a fair Change wrought in you since Yester-day Morning; then you Talk't of nothing but Repentance, and Amendment of Life. Capt. 'Faith I have consider'd better on't: For conversing a whole Day together with honest Men, I found 'um all so Poor and Beggarly, that a civil Person would be asham'd to be seen with 'um. But you come from Don Rodorick's Cabin; what Hopes have you of his Life? Pyr. No danger of it, only loss of Bood Had made him Faint away; he call'd for you: Capt. Well, are his Jewels and his Plate brought in? Pyr. They are; when Hoyst we Sails? Capt. At the first break Of Day: When we are got out clear, wee'l seize On Rod'rick and his Men: They are not many, But fear may make 'um Desp'rate. Pyr. We may take 'um, When they are laid to Sleep. Capt. 'Tis well advis'd. Pyr. I forgot to tell you, Sir, that a little before Don Rod'rick Was brought in, a company ef Gentlemen (pursu'd It seems by Justice) procur'd our Boat to Row 'um Hither: Two of 'um carried a very fair Lady betwixt 'um, Who was either Dead, or Swoonded. Capt. Wee'l Sell 'um altogether to the Turk, (At least I'l tell him so.) [Aside. Pyr. Pray, Sir, let us reserve the Lady to our own uses; It were a shame to good Catholiques to give her up To Infidells. Capt. Don Rod'ricks Door opens, I'l speak to him.â The Scene draws, and discovers the Captains Cabin; Rodorick on a Bed, and two Servants by him. Capt. How is it with the brave Don Rodorick? Do you want any thing? Rod. I have too much Of that I would not, Love; And what I would have, that I want, Revenge. I must be set Ashore. Capt. That you may, Sir; But our own Safety must be thought on first. [One enters, and Whispers the Captain. Capt. I come:âSennor, think you are Lord here, and command All freely. [Exit Captain and Pyrat. Rod. He does well to bid me think so: I am of opinion We are fallen into Hucksters hands. 1 Serv. Indeed he talk'd Suspitiously enough; He half denied to Land us. Rod. These, Pedro, Are your Confiding men.â 2. Serv. I think 'um still so. Rod. Would I were from 'um. 2. 'Tis impossible T'attempt it now; you have not Strength enough To Walk. Rod. That Venture must be mine; wee'r lost If we stay here to morrow. 2. I hope better. 1. One whom I saw among 'um, to my knowledge, Is a notorious Robber. 2. He look'd so like a Gentleman, I could not know him then. Rod. What became of Julia when I fell? 1. We left her Weeping over you, till we Were beaten off; but She, and those with her Were gone when we return'd. Rod. Too late I find I wrong'd her in my Thoughts; I'm every way A wretched Man:â Something we must resolve on e'r we Sleep; Draw in the Bed, I feel the Cold. [Bed drawn in, Exeunt. Scene the Second. Enter Gonsalvo, Manuel, Hippolito, Amideo. Hip. Nay, 'tis too true; for Peeping through a Chink, I saw Don Rod'rick lying on a Bed, Not Dead, as we suppos'd, but only Hurt; So waited on as spoke him Master here. Man. Was there ever so Fatal an adventure? To fly into that very Ship for refuge Where th'only Person we would shun, Commands! This Mischief is so strange it could not happen, But was the Plot and Juggle of our Fate To free it Self, and cast the Blame on us. Gons. This is not yet our Fortune's utmost Malice; The Gall-remains behind: This Ship was that Which Yester-day was mine; I can see nothing Round me, but what's familiar to my Eyes, Only the Persons new; which makes me think 'Twas seiz'd upon by Rod'rick, to revenge Himself on me. Man. 'Tis wonderfull indeed. Amid. The only comfort is, we are not known, For when we Enter'd it was Dark. Hip. That comfort Is of as short continuance as the Night, The Day will soon discover us. Man. Some way must be invented to get out. Hip. Fair Julia, sadly pining by her Self, Sits on her Bed; Tears falling from her Eyes As silently as Dews in dead of Night. All we consult of must be kept from her: That moment that she knows of Rodorick's Life Dooms us to certain Death. Man. 'Tis well consider'd. Gons. For my part, were not you and she concern'd, I look on my own Life, like an Estate So charg'd with Debts, it is not worth the keeping. We cannot long be undiscover'd by them; Let us then Rush upon them on the suddain, (All hope of Safety plac'd in our despair) And gain quick Victory, or speedy Death. Man. Consider first th'impossibility Of the attempt; four Men, and two poor Boys (Which added to our Number make us Weaker) Against ten Villains, more resolv'd for Death Than any ten among our Holiest Priests. Stay but a little longer, till they all Disperse to rest within their several Cabins, Then more securely we may Set upon them, And Kill them half before the rest can Wake: By this means too, the Boys are usefull for us; For they can cut the Throats of Sleeping men. Hip. Now have I the greatest Temptation in the World to reveal Thou art a Woman. [To Amideo. Amid. If 'twere not for thy Beauty, my Master should know What a Man he keeps. [To her. Hip. Why should we have Recourse to desp'rate ways, When safer may be thought on? 'Tis like giving the extream Unction In the beginning of a Sickness: Can you imagine to find all Asleep? The wicked Joy of having such a Booty In their Possession, will keep some Awake: And some, no doubt, will watch with Wounded Rod'rick. Amid. What would your Wisdome now propose? Hip. To say That some of us are Sea-sick; (your Complexion Will make th'excuse for us who are less Fair:) So by good words and promises procure We may be set Ashore, e'r Morning come. Amid. O the deep Reasons of the grave Hippolito! As if 'twere likely in so Calm a Season We should be Sick so soon; or if we were, Whom should we choose among us to go tell it? For who ere Ventures out must needs be known; Or if none knew us, can you think that Pyrats Will let us go upon such easie terms As promising Rewards?âLet me advise you. Hip. Now we expect an Oracle. Amid. Here are Bundles Of Canvas and of Cloath you see lye by us, In which one of us shall Sow up the rest, Only some Breathing place, for Air, and Food; Then call the Pyrats in, and tell them, we For fear had Drown'd our selves: And when we come To the next Port, find means to bring us out. Hip. Pithily spoken! As if you were to bind up Marble Statutes, Which only bore the shapes of Men without, And had no need of ever easing Nature. Gons. There's but one way left, that's this: You know the Rope by which the Cock-boat's ty'd, Goes down by th'Stern, and now we are at Anchor, There sits no Pylot to discover us; My Counsel is, to go down by the Ladder, And being once there, unloose, and Row to Shore. Man. This, without doubt, were best; but there lies ever Some one or more within the Boat to watch it. Gons. I'l slide down first, and run the Venture of it; You shall come after me, if there be need, To give me Succour. Man. 'Tis the only way. Gons. Go into Julia then, and first prepare her With knowledge of the Pyrats, and the danger Her Honour's in among such Barb'rous people. Man. Leave it to me. Amid. Hippolito and Julia, My Rivals, like two pointed Rocks appear; And I through both must to Gonsalvo steer. [Aside. [Exeunt all but Hippolito. Hip. As from some steep and dreadfull Precipice, The frighted Travellour casts down his Eyes, And sees the Ocean at so great a distance, It looks as if the Skies were sunk below him; Yet if some Neighb'ring shrub (how weak soe'r) Peeps up, his willing Eyes stop gladly there, And seem to ease themselves, and rest upon it: So in my Desp'rate state, each little comfort Preserves me from despair: Gonsalvo strove not With greater care to give away his Julia, Than I have done to part with my Gonsalvo, Yet neither brought to pass our hatefull wish: Then we may meet, since different ways we move, Chasing each other in the Maze of Love. [Exit Hippolito. Scene the Third. Enter Don Rodorick, carried by two Servants. 1 Serv. It was the only way that could be thought on, To get down by the Ladder to the Boat. 2. You may thank me for that Invention. Rod. What a Noise is herd! when the least Breath's As Dang'rous as a Tempest. 2. If any of those Rogues should hear him talk, In what a case were we? Rod. O Patience, patience! This Ass brays out for Silence. Enter at the other end, Manuel, leading Julia; Gonsalvo, Hippolito, Amideo. Gons. Hark! what Noise is that? go softly. They meet on the middle of the Stage. Rod. Who's here! I am betray'd; and nothing grieves me But I want strength to Dye with honour. Jul. Rod'rick! Is it thy Voice my Love? Speak and resolve me Whither thou Liv'st, or I am Dead with thee? Man. Kill him, and force our way. Rod. Is Manuel there? Hold up my Arm that I may make one thrust At him before I Dye. Gons. Since we must fall, Wee'l Sell our Lives as dearly as we can. 1. Serv. And wee'l defend our Master to the last. [Fight. Enter Pyrats, without their Captain. 1 Pyr. What's the meaning of this Uproar? Quarrelling Amongst your selves at Midnight? 2 Pyr. We are come in a fit time to decide the difference. Man. Hold Gentlemen, wee'r equally concern'd, To Rodorick's Servants. We for our own, you for your Masters safety; If we joyn Forces we may then resist 'um, If not, both Sides are ruin'd. 1 Serv. We agree; Gons. Come o'r on our Side then. [They joyn. 1 Pyr. A Mischief on our Captain's Drowsiness; Wee'r lost for want of him. [They Fight. Gons. Dear Madam, get behind, while you are safe [To Julia. We cannot be o'rcome. [They drive off the Pyrats, and follow them off. Rodorick remains on the Ground. Rod. I had much rather my own Life were lost Than Manuel's were preserv'd.â Enter the Pyrat's retreating before Gonsalvo, &amp;c. 1 Pyr. All's lost; they Fight like Devils, and our Captain Yet Sleeping in his Bed. 2. Here lies Don Rod'rick; If we must Dye, wee'l not leave him behind. [Goes to Kill him. Jul. O spare my Rod'rick's Life, and in exchange Take mine; I put my Self within your Pow'r, To Save or Kill. 1 Pyr. So, here's another Pawn For all our Safeties. Man. Heav'n! What has she done? Gons. Let go the Lady, or expect no mercy: The least drop of her Blood is worth all yours And mine together. 1 Pyr. I am glad you think so: Either deliver up your Sword, or mine Shall pierce her Heart this moment. Gons. Here, here, take it. Man. You are not Mad to give away all hopes Manuel holds him. Of safety and defence, from us, from her, And from your Self at once! Gons. When she is Dead What is there worth Defending? Man. Will you trust A Pyrat's promise sooner than your Valour? Gons. Any thing, rather than see her in Danger. 1 Pyr. Nay, if you dispute the matter! [Holds his Sword to her Breast. Gons. I yield, I yield; Reason to Love must bow: Love, that gives Courage, can make Cowards too. [Gives his Sword. Jul. O strange effect of a most Generous passion! Rod. His Enemies themselves must needs admire it. Man. Nay, if Gonsalvo makes a Fashion of it, 'Twill be Valour to Dye tamely. [Gives his. Hip. I am for Dying too with my dear Master. Amid. My Life will go as eas'ly as a Flies, The least Fillip does it in this Fright. 1 Pyr. One call our Captain up: Tell him, he deserves little of the Booty. Jul. It has so much prevail'd upon my Soul, I ever must acknowledge it. [To Gonsalvo. Rod. Julia has reason, if she Love him; yet I find I cannot bear it. [Aside. Gons. Say but you Love me; I am more than Paid. Jul. You ask that only thing I cannot give; Were I not Rod'ricks first, I should be Yours; My violent Love for him, I know is faulty, Yet Passion never can be plac'd so ill, But that to change it is the greater Crime: Inconstancy is such a Guilt, as makes That very Love suspected which it brings; It brings a Gift, but 'tis of ill-got Wealth, The spoils of some forsaken Lovers heart: Love alter'd once, like Blood let out before, Will lose its Virtue, and can Cure no more. Gons. In those few Minutes which I have to Live, To be call'd yours is all I can enjoy; Rodorick receives no Prejudice by that; I would but make some small Acquaintance here, For fear I never should enquire you out In that new World which we are going to. Amid. Then I can hold no longer;âyou desire In Death to be call'd Hers; and all I wish Is Dying to be Yours. Hip. You'l not discover? [Aside. Amid. See here the most unfortunate of Women, That Angellina, whom you all thought lost; And lost she was indeed; when she beheld Gonsalvo first. All. How! Angellina! Rod. Ha! My Sister? Amid. I thought to have fled Love in flying Manuel, But Love pursu'd me in Gonsalvo's Shape; For him I Ventur'd all that Maids hold dear, Th'opinion of my Modesty, and Virtue, My loss of Fortune, and my Brothers love. For him I have expos'd my Self to Dangers, Which, (great themselves, yet) greater would appear, If you could see them through a Womans fear: But why do I my Right by Dangers prove? The greatest Argument for Love, is Love: That passion, Julia, while he Lives, denies, He should refuse to give her when he Dyes: Yet grant he did his Life to her bequeath, May I not claim my share of him in Death? I only begg, when all the Glory's gone, The heatless Beams of a departing Sun. Gons. Never was Passion hid so modestly, So generously reveal'd. Man. Wee'r now a chain of Lovers linck'd in Death; Julia goes first, Gonsalvo hangs on her, And Angellina holds upon Gonsalvo, As I on Angellina. Hip. Nay, here's Honoria too:â You look on me with wonder in your Eyes, To see me here, and in this strange disguise. Jul. What new Miracle is this? Honoria! Man. I left you with my Aunt at Barcellona, And thought ere this you had been Married to The old Rich man, Don Estevan de Gama: Hip. I ever had a strange Aversion for him; But when Gonsalvo Landed there, and made A kind of Courtship, (though it seems in Jeast) It serv'd to Conquer me, which Estevan Perceiving, prest my Aunt to haste the Marriage. What should I do? my Aunt importun'd me For the next Day: Gonsalvo, though I Lov'd him, Knew not my Love; nor was I sure his Courtship Was not th'effect of a bare Gallantry. Gons. Alas! how griev'd I am, that slight address Should make so deep Impressions on your Mind In three Days time. Hip. That accident in which You sav'd my Life, when first you saw me, caus'd it. Though now the Story be too long to tell; Howe'r it was, hearing that Night you lay Aboard your Ship, thus as you see Disguis'd, In Cloaths belong to my Youngest Nephew, I Rose e'r Day, resolv'd to find you out, And, if I could, procure to wait on you Without discovery of my Self; but Fortune Crost all my Hopes. Gons. It was that dismal Night Which tore my Anchor up, and tost my Ship Past hope of Safety, many Days together, Untill at length it threw me on this Port. Hip. I will not tell you what my Sorrows were To find you gone; but there was now no help. Go back again I durst not: But, in fine, Thought best, as fast as my weak Leggs would bear me To come to Alicant, and find my Sister, Unknown to any else: But being neer The City, I was seiz'd upon by Thieves, From whom you Rescu'd me; the rest you know. Gons. I know too much indeed for my Repose. Enter Captain. Capt. Do you know me? Gons. Now I look better on thee, Thou seem'st a greater Villain than I thought thee. Jul. 'Tis he. Hip. That Bloody wretch who Robb'd us in The Woods. Gons. Slave! Dar'st thou lift thy Hand against me? Dar'st thou touch any one whom he protects; Who gave thee Life? But I accuse my self, Not thee: The Death of all these Guiltless persons Became my Crime that Minute when I spar'd thee. Capt. It is not all your Threats can alter me From what I have resolv'd. Gons. Begin then first With me. Capt. I will, by laying here my Sword. Lays his Sword at Gonsalvo's feet. All. What means this suddain Change? Capt. 'Tis neither new, nor suddain: from that time You gave me Life, I watch'd how to Repay it; And Rod'rick's Servant gave me speedy means T'effect my Wish: For telling me, his Master Meant a Revenge on you, and on Don Manuel, And then to seize on Julia, and depart: I proffer'd him my Aid to seize a Vessel; And having by Enquiry found out Yours, Acquainted first the Captain with my purpose, To make a seeming Mast'ry of the Ship. Man. How durst he take your Word? Capt. That I secur'd By letting him give notice to the Ships That lay about: This done, knowing the place You were to Fight on was behind the Rock; Not far from thence, I, and some chosen Men Lay out of Sight, that if foul Play were offer'd, We might prevent it. But came not in; because when there was need, Don Manuel, who was nearer, stept before me. Gons. Then the Boat which seem'd To lye by chance; Hulling not far from Shore, Was plac'd by your Direction there? Capt. It was. Gons. You'r truly Noble; and I owe much more Than my own Life and Fortunes to your worth. Capt. 'Tis time I should restore their Liberty To such of Yours as yet are seeming Pris'ners. I'l wait on you again. [Exit Captain. Rod. My Enemies are happy, and the Storm Prepar'd for them, must break upon my Head. Gons. So far am I from Happiness, Heav'n knows My Griefs are Doubled:â I stand Ingag'd in hopeless Love to Julia; In Gratitude to these: Here I have giv'n my Heart, and here I owe it. Hip. Dear Master, trouble not your Self for me; I ever made your Happiness my own; Let Julia witness with what Faith I serv'd you, When you employ'd me in your Love to her. I gave your Noble heart away, as if It had been some light Gallant's, little worth: Not that I Lov'd you less than Angellina, But my Self less than You. Gons. Wonder of Honour, Of which my Own was but a fainter Shadow, When I gave Julia, whom I could not keep. You fed a Fire within, with too rich Fuel, In giving it your Heart to Prey upon; The sweetest-Off'ring that was ever Burnt Since last the PhÃ¦nix Dy'd. Hip. If Angellina, knew like me, the Pride Of Noble minds, which is to give, not take; Like me she would be Satisfy'd, her Heart Was well bestow'd, and ask for no return. Amid. Pray let my Heart alone; you'l use it as The Gipsies do our Money; If they once Touch it, they have Pow'r upon't. Enter the Servant, who appear'd in the first Act with Gonsalvo. Serv. O my dear Lord, Gonsalvo de Peralta! Rod. De Peralta said you? You amaze me! Gons. Why, Do you know that Family in Sevil? Rod. I am my Self the elder Brother of it. Gons. Don Rod'rick de Peralta! Rod. I was so, Untill my Mother Dy'd, whose Name de Sylva I chose, (our Custom not forbidding it) Three Years ago, when I return'd from Flanders: I came here to possess a fair Estate Left by an Aunt; her Sister, for whose sake, I take that Name, and lik'd the place so well, That never since I have return'd to Sevil. Gons. 'Twas then that change of Name which caus'd my Letters All to miscarry: What an happy Tempest Was this, which would not let me rest at Sevil, But Blew me farther on to see you here. Amid. Brother, I come to claim a Sister's share; But you'r too near me, to be nearer now. Gons. In my room let me beg you to receive Don Manuel. Amid. I take it half unkindly, You give me from your Self so soon; Don Manuel I know is Worthy, and but Yester-day Preserv'd my Life; but it will take some time To change my Heart; Man. I'l watch it patiently, as Chymists do Their golden Birth; and when 'tis Chang'd, receive it With greater care than they their rich Elyxir, Just passing from one Vial to another. Rod. Julia is still my Brother's, though I loose her. Gons. You shall not loose her; Julia was Born For none but you; And I for none but my Honoria: Julia is Yours by Inclination; And I by Conquest am Honoria's. Hon. 'Tis the most Glorious one that e'r was made: And I no longer will dispute my Happiness. Rod. Julia, you know my peevish Jealousies; I cannot promise you a better Husband Than you have had a Servant. Jul. I receive you With all your Faults. Rod. And think, when I am Froward, My sullen Humour punishes it self; I'm like a Day in March, sometimes o'r-cast With Storms, but then the after Clearness is The greater: The worst is, where I Love most, The Tempest falls most heavy. Jul. Ah! What a little time to Love is Lent? Yet half that time is in Unkindness spent. Rod. That you may see some hope of my Amendment, I give my Friendship to Don Manuel, ere My Brother asks, or he himself desires it. Man. I'l ever Cherish it. Gons. Since for my Sake you become Friends, my care Shall be to keep you so: You, Captain, shall Command this Carrack, and with her my Fortunes: You, my Honoria, though you have an Heart Which Julia left, yet think it not the worse; 'Tis not worn out, but Polish'd by the wearing. Your merit shall her Beauties pow'r remove; Beauty but gains, Obligement keeps our Love. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
