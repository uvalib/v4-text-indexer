      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. The story of the following Tragedy is fictitious; the event may without impropriety be supposed to have happened on the coast of Ireland, which the Northern nations were accustomed to plunder before its conversion to Christianity. The Greek form of dramatic writing has been adopted as affording in its choruses the most favourable opportunity for the display of mythological imagery. Rhyme has not been used in the choral odes, both because it was less comformable to the model imitated, and because it appeared unnecessary, if not prejudicial in this species of poetry.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE. A Saxon Castle in the Possession of Harold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. MOINA. Full fifty nights have cast their gloom around me Since first the hated Saxon tore me trembling From parents, kindred, and a much lov'd land— Yet loss of parents, kindred, and my country Scarce move a soul opprest with keener grief; In the loud strife of arms, in fields of blood, My Carril fighting with a lover's fury Fell—fell by Harold's arm, and smiling hope For ever fled my breast—here, here he lives, And while my eyes behold this hated light He still shall live, and still with sullen pleasure I'll dwell on other times, when all was hope, When all was love and joy—accursed beauty! Would that the god of Fura's sacred wood Had blasted this fair form—the Saxon then Had seen and hated me.—Wife?—wife?— Yes—'tis a murderer's arm embraces me, A murderer calls me his, the murderer Of Carril!—Would this hand— But hark! the sound of song, the morning greeting Of aged bards.— BARDS. (Entering.) CHORUS. Hail to her whom Frea loves, Moina, hail: When first thy infant eyes beheld The blushing beam of orient day Frea from Valhalla's groves Mark'd thy birth in silent joy; From Valhalla's groves she sent The swift-wing'd messenger of love Gna is the name of Frea's messenger; Fulla and Gnossa also attended her., Bearing in her rosy hand The gold-tipt horn of gods; From this thy infant lips imbib'd Three lingering drops of mead divine The common beverage of the Northern deities., Thro' thy tender frame distilling, They form'd thy snowy limbs to grace, They gloss'd thy raven hair, Illum'd thy sparkling eyes, And flush'd thy cheek with crimson hue Unfading. Hail to her whom Frea loves, Moina, hail. MOINA. Ye venerable men, my grief-worn soul Scarce heeds your salutation: child of sorrow The soothing voice of flattery passes by me, Like feeble gales which fan a warring host, Unnotic'd.—Is your chief return'd? BARD. As yet No messenger of victory has reach'd us. MOINA. To slay, to conquer, these are Harold's pleasures, To stain his dark-blue steel with human gore; Cannot the glad repast, the song of bards, The vigor-giving chace, the solemn council, Withdraw the savage hero from the battle? No—these are vain.—To stab the faithful lover, To shed the blood of brothers and of sons, To deal the dole of misery to thousands, These are the only joys a Saxon feels.— God of my fathers, strike the fell destroyers, Blunt, blunt their steel, benumb their hardy sinews, Pour out their red heart's blood, that peace again May bless my country. BARD. E'en the gods themselves Edda Sæmundar. Vafthrudnismal, xli., Who dwell above in happiness and glory, Delight in shining arms and fierce encounter; From fair Valhalla's halls they rush with joy To meet each other in the strife of spears, They fight but for their sport; when tir'd of battle Again they seek the banquet, quaff again From gold-encircled horn the sparkling mead, And joyful feast upon Serimner's flesh The name of the wild boar which was the food of the gods: though they were constantly feasting on it its flesh was never consumed.; Such is their happy life; and can'st thou wonder That man should imitate the gods? that man Should laugh at fear, and dauntless die to claim A glorious seat All those who died bravely in battle were immediately received by Odin into his palace, and joined the society of the other deities. at Odin's splendid board? MOINA. And may Valhalla's halls be quickly fill'd With Saxon souls— Thou unseen power, who in my country's woods In awful silence dwell'st, whom trembling druids With hallow'd rites invoke, arise, arise, And wing the hissing dart to Harold's bosom.— BARD. Beware—nor call the vengeance of thy gods Upon a husband's head; should Harold fall, Shuddering I see what follows.— MOINA. What can follow? What keener woes than those I know already? A breathless lover and an aged parent In sorrow sinking to the narrow house? The breast of Moina fears no greater anguish. BARD. No more—our words distress you, and you lose The pleasant freshness of the morning air. MOINA. Ye aged bards, farewell. CHORUS OF BARDS. King of gods on shining throne Lidskialsa was the name of Odin's throne whence the whole world was supposed to be visible to him., Thou, who with a single glance Piercest Nature's wide extent, Thou, who from the spring of Mimer Quaffest liquid lore divine, Odin, hear. King of gods, whom Hydrasil With sacred shadow veils, Whilst around thee sit cœlestials, Whilst beneath thee Fates attend, Odin, hear. King of men, on coal-black steed, Brave in battle, brave in death, Pierc'd with arrows nine Odin, whilst he was yet on earth, is recorded to have stabbed himself at an advanced period of age in nine different places. The Gothic nations esteemed it dishonorable not to die a violent death. In agony thou smil'st; King of men, whose dark-blue steel No foe unconquer'd saw, Soon his heart's blood smok'd around, Soon his fainting soul retir'd. Odin, hear.— In Harold's breast thy spirit pour, String his nerves, his eyes inflame, Direct his brawny arm to deal The darts of death around, In the tempest of the battle Throw thy shield of safety round him, Protect him with thy mighty hand, And send him back with victory. But should the Fatal Sisters mark Our chieftain's soul to grace thy halls, Should the keen arrow pierce his side And Harold perish in the fight, When death shall hover round his heart, When his firm knees shall tottering fail, When shades of night shall gloom his eyes And sinking nature yield, Then may no groan of woe escape Our hardy chieftain's fainting lips, Then may no writhing agony Deform the hero's face, Joyful to fall in fields of blood To him may death's cold steel be welcome, And may he laughing die. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. CARRIL. (In the Habit of a Bard.) Under the cover of these sacred garments, A sure protection from the hand of insult, I yet may hope to find my much-lov'd Moina; Since first these wounded limbs recover'd strength I've vainly wander'd; many a stately castle Has hospitably cheer'd my fainting body, But on my mind forlorn no gleam of joy Has yet arisen—perhaps within these walls— Ah no—my tortures must not finish yet— Would that the pious hands which found me bleeding 'Midst heaps of slain had left me there to perish, Then had the long calm sleep of death opprest me, Nor had I woke to anguish.— (Bards enter.) Ye aged bards, have pity on a brother, Receive me to your hospitable halls An unbounded hospitality was one of the most prominent and amiable features in the character of our Northern ancestors.—Quemcunque mortalium arcere tecto, nefas, monstrator hospitii et comes proximam domum non invitati adeunt, nec interest, pari humanitate accipiuntur. Notum ignotumque quantum ad jus hospitii nemo discernit. Tacitus de Mor. German. S. 21., Weary and faint I ask but some refreshment, Shut not your doors against a helpless man.— BARD. Accurst be he who 'gainst the suppliant stranger Shall bolt his massy iron gates, unmindful Of misery's voice.—These halls have ever offer'd Food and repose to weary travellers. CARRIL. I thank ye venerable men—but say, What warlike chieftain calls this castle his? BARD. 'Tis Harold's castle, urg'd by restless valour He seeks the strife of spears and quits his home. CARRIL. And does no beauty weep for his return? BARD. A beauty weeps but not for his return; Another cause of woe has pal'd her cheeks, Has shrunk her comely form and dimm'd The lustre of her eyes; she weeps her home. CARRIL. Speak, holy man, her name? BARD. Her name is Moina— Why does the red-blood leave thy cheek? why does The cold dew damp thy face? Thy feeble knees Can scarce support thee.— CARRIL. (After a pause.) 'Tis a sudden fainting, Worn with fatigue and hunger, this weak frame Sinks under me. BARD. Retire, and take refreshment. CHORUS OF BARDS. 'Tis not he whose arched halls Resound with revelry and song That tastes the purest joy, But he who from his ample stores Feeds the hungry, cheers the faint, On languid features casts the smile And lights up radiance in the eye; Him the traveller shall bless, Him the gods will love. When the noon-tide sun has scorch'd The sickly plants on parched hills, The dews of eve restore their vigor; When the sultry summer's heat Has dried the torrents on the rocks, The falling rain renews their springs And verdure spreads around. CARRIL. (Returning.) My strength is now renew'd, I fain would meet The lady of these halls, to offer thanks For such a kind reception. BARD. See, she comes, Returning from her morning walk, she passes Towards her chamber, haste, accost her. CARILL. Lady, A stranger whom your stately halls receiv'd Fatigu'd and hungry, humbly offers thanks For food and rest: and if 'tis your good pleasure The wandering bard will raise the sound of song, The grateful sound of praise. MOINA. Thou holy man, The flattering song is hateful to my ear, But if thou know'st to raise the mournful voice, And softly sound the melancholy tale, My sickly soul could listen with delight. CARRIL. Please you to sit, fair lady, while I pour The melting strains of woe. Peace, winds of night, ye roaring tempests, peace, Soft glide, ye torrents, from the echoing hills, Walk thro' dark clouds, pale moon, and dimly shoot From time to time a mournful beam, skriek not Ye famish'd eagles, wolves, forget your howlings, Let all be silent, dark. Ghosts of my fathers, bend your shadowy forms To hear the tale of woe— The tale of woe which Mornac thus began. Fair was my daughter on the hills of Fura, Fair as the moon-beam, white as drifted snow, Sweet as the gale of spring—why starts the tear? Why heaves the sigh in Mornac's aged bosom? No more my Lora meets me on the heath, No more she cheers my soul with pleasant song, My echoing halls are silent— The soft mist rises from the lakes, and fills The flowers with dew, the cheering sun returns, The mist is gone—no beam of joy dispells The mist of Mornac's soul, but lasting sorrow Cleaves to my aged heart—my child, where art thou? Dark is thy bed, O Lora, grief has crush'd Thy tender form, far from a parent's bosom The hand of rapine snatch'd thee, and thy sleep Ere this is deep—accursed be the chief Who fought on Fura's plains, my feeble arm Benumb'd with age's winter struck in vain; In vain did Carril fight, the much-lov'd Carril; Swift was his step, full rose his sinewy limbs, As a dark cloud he mov'd, and shook his glittering spear— The steel deep pierc'd his side, death's gloom o'erspread him, And mid'st the slain he fell.—Fear seiz'd our soldiers, They fled the strife of spears; the conquering Saxons Enter'd our halls defenceless, thence they bore My Lora, but the blue-eyed chief disdain'd To smear his dark-blue steel with aged blood. Cruel he spar'd me to lament my woes And sink in anguish to the narrow house. When the huge mass of snow from lofty hills Descends impetuous on the cottage roof, And buries in its fall the father, mother, And infant offspring, then no sound of woe Is heard, no parent weeping for a child, No child deep-sobbing for a tender parent, All find a common grave and sleep in peace— But when the roaring torrent rushes down From dark-brown rocks, and from the mountain-deer Snatches her sportive fawn, the hapless mother Rejects her food, forgets the wonted spring And quits the joyous herd, to hide Her tear-worn face in gloomy dells.—Thus Mornac Rejects the joys of life to weep in secret. And now, the conquering enemy retir'd, The white rob'd druids from their sacred woods, Come forth, they haste to bear our fallen friends To their dark home—when Carril they espied Yet breathing.— BARD. Aged man, thy mournful tale Has deeply touch'd our lady—she retires— Finish thy song. CARRIL. In Carril's wounds they pour The healing balm, recall his fainting soul And raise him up to misery.—And now O'er Fura's plains the lover wanders mourning, In Fura's mossy towers the father weeps.— Rise, winds of night, ye raging tempests, rise, Roar loud ye torrents from the echoing hills, Shriek, shriek, ye eagles, howl, ye hungry wolves, Ye black clouds gather round and swiftly dart The tined lightening to encrease the horror— Ghosts of my fathers, hasten to your clouds— The solemn song is sung. A MESSENGER. (Entering.) Moina, old man, commands you to attend her. Follow.— CHORUS OF BARDS. What sounds cœlestial float Upon the liquid air And charm the listening gods? Is it the rustling breeze 'Midst Glasor's golden boughs Glasor was a forest in Valhalla; the trees which composed it shot forth golden branches.? Is it the white-neck'd swan's The Scandinavians had the same opinion of the musical powers of this bird as the Greeks and Romans. Melodious strains? No—'tis Braga's harp, Braga sweeps the sounding strings, Fair Iduna's golden hair There is a tradition that Braga, the god of poetry and music, strung his harp with the flaxen locks of his wife Iduna., Mimer's stream inspires the god, With swimming eyes And soul of fire He pours the tide of harmony.— He whom Braga loves Can swell the solemn sound, Can raise the notes of joy, And tune the softest shell. He whom Braga loves Can sound the warlike lay, Inflame the chieftain's soul, And send him in his glittering arms To fields of blood. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. CARRIL AND MOINA. MOINA. In vain you urge my flight—tho' force compell'd me To share the bed of Harold, whilst he breathes I'm his alone, nor shall my sacred honour Be ever blasted, then e'en Carril's self Would hate me, faithless—should some nervous arm Transfix the Saxon, joy again might burst Upon the cloud of grief which veils us round, Then might I fly and rest in Carril's arms. CARRIL. Then is there one way left, when Harold's step Resounds within his halls, this hand shall— MOINA. No, Carril, no—I love thy daring spirit, Yet should the chieftain bleed within these walls, A sure destruction waits upon us both. Calm thy fierce courage—on the road which leads O'er yonder hills, a gloomy forest borders, The sun-beams never pierce its sides, the wolf, The hissing snake possess it; there resides A prophetess deep skill'd That these prophetesses or witches were held in great veneration among the Northern nations is confirmed by the testimony of various authors.—Inesse quin etiam, (says Tacitus, de Mor.

Thy hasty step forebodes us good, thou com'st To tell the victory of Harold? SOLDIER. No, Our chief is fallen in the strife of spears, Bravely he fought by multitudes opprest, His blows were death; at length a hissing dart Pierc'd his brave side; his heart's blood follow'd gushing; Death dimm'd his eyes; he feebly rais'd his arm As if to strike again; his sinews fail'd him; He fell: in death's last agonies he grasp'd His weapon; cold and bloody, yet he looks The hero— BARD. Thus should a Saxon fall. SOLDIER. His faithful people With fury rush'd around him, tore his body From the surrounding warriors—now they bear him In mournful silence to his lofty halls, And haste to lay him 'midst his brave forefathers. BARD. Soldier, let Moina hear the fate of Harold. CHORUS OF BARDS. Softly strike the harp And swell the sounds of woe, Harold falls, His blue eyes close, His golden hair is red, He falls in blood. See at the festive board His faithful warriors sit, In vain they cast their eyes around To meet their chieftain's looks; Sorrow glooms their souls And dashes from their lips The sparkling shell. The hunter's horn resounds, The stout dogs leap around And seek their chief, No more shall Harold's voice Be heard the woods among. The famish'd eagle screams And asks his wonted food, No more shall Harold's arm Prepare the bloody feast. Yet not to Hela's dark abode Our chieftain's soul is fled, He rises on the rushing blast And seeks Valhalla's halls. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter Moina, Carril meeting her. MOINA. Welcome my Carril to thy Moina's arms, Now am I thine, my love; this joyful night Shall shade us flying to our native country; Again my aged father shall behold His happy daughter, and the white rob'd druid Shall hear our holy vows.—The chief is fall'n.— CARRIL. Thou unseen power, when deep despair surrounds us, When the dark night of woe o'ershades the soul, Sudden thou shin'st amidst surrounding horrors, The cloud is gone, and keenest joy bursts in Upon the darken'd mind.—The prophetess Foreboded Harold's death— MOINA. And 'tis accomplish'd, Bless'd be the arm which pierc'd his hated heart; Say, Carril, did the prophetess foretell A happy issue to our flight, and promise Long days of joy and love?—tell, tell me all. CARRIL. My hasty steps soon reach'd the gloomy wood I sought; and struggling thro' the thorny paths To find the dwelling of the prophetess, I mark'd a craggy rock whose broken summit Was veil'd by creeping shrubs—it's bottom yawn'd And shew'd a deep dark gulph—I fearless enter'd, And with extended arms I trac'd my way, For there no beam of light was seen to glimmer Save that which rose from magic incantations; While thus advancing slow, a dead cold hand Caught mine, a hoarse voice thus address'd me, Who art thou, man, that dar'st with impious step Disturb my silent dwelling? Speak or perish.— Mildly I answer'd, prophetess, a stranger, A miserable stranger seeks thy aid; O tell me, I conjure you by your gods, If Harold's doom be seal'd, if grief-worn Moina Shall e'er behold again her native home And dwell with Carril?—Hence, away, she cries, I know thee now, thyself art Carril, hence, I hate the foes of Harold.— With that I forward rush'd, and in my arms Seizing the prophetess, I cried aloud Unfeeling woman, tell me what I ask, Or these firm arms shall from thy feeble body Set loose thy cursed soul.—My son, she said, Forbear, I yield, thy bravery has won me, Approach—within my cave a new slain corse, Born by my spirits from the field of slaughter, Yet bleeds, by Harold's arm this day transfix'd, The soul is seated in Valhalla's halls, But by my potent art I'll call it back, Force it to animate the bloody limbs, And truly answer thy demands.—She spake, And blue light flash'd around me; I beheld The bleeding man—with hoarse rough voice she 'gan To sound the Runic rhyme, and singing still, The corse uprear'd his head and clotted hair, And slowly cast his ghastly eyes around, Then sunk again, as if the soul had fear'd To animate a hateful mangl'd body; The prophetess observ'd him, and in wrath She seiz'd a living snake and lash'd his limbs— Uprose the corse, his languid eyes he fix'd On me, thus speaking—Tell me, Carril, quickly, For well I know thee, Carril, what's thy pleasure? Dismiss me hence with speed to halls of joy. Warrior, I said, is Harold's death decreed?— He bleeds, he bleeds, I see him fall On the corse-spread plain— Send me back to halls of joy. Yet speak, shall Moina with her Carril dwell? E'er the setting sun shall shoot His reddest rays across the waves Moina's woes shall be at peace— I go, I go to halls of joy— He said, and smiling sullenly, fell lifeless. Then from the cave with joyous steps I hasten'd To bear the glad forebodings to my Moina. MOINA. Again the sun of joy bursts forth and gilds Our future days.—But now retire, my Carril, Instantly quit the castle and attend me In the dark dell which borders on the wood Some two miles off.—The followers of Harold, Bearing his body to the narrow house, Are near at hand, and when the chief is laid At peace, I'll steal unnotic'd from the walls, And fly on love-wing'd step to Carril's arms. [Carril goes out. Now, haste ye tardy minutes, till the dews Of evening fall, arise ye floating clouds, And shroud the silver moon in welcome darkness;— Enter a Bard. BARD. Lady, the soldiers bear our chieftain's body Within our castle gates, the grave is ready, The holy rites prepar'd, we wait thy presence. MOINA. My presence, venerable man, and wherefore? BARD. Know'st thou not then the custom of our land? The laws which ages past have render'd sacred? Know'st thou not, lady, with her husband's body The wife is buried This is a custom recorded in Mallet's Northern Antiquities. Vol I. p. 342. The authorities quoted for it are—Edda Mythol. 43.—Hist.

Lib. 4. S. 17. As Moina was a Celt and but lately a prisoner, she may very well be supposed ignorant of this barbarous law., that in other worlds He still may share her fond embraces, still May dwell with her in joy? MOINA. Buried?— BARD. Our laws have so decreed it, lady, And their decrees unalterably stand; Haste then with Harold to the halls of joy, Haste to the feast of gods— MOINA. Have pity on me— Spare, spare my life—O save me, save me— Hadst thou but offer'd death when Harold led me A weeping captive from my native shore, With joy I'd follow'd to the grave—but now— Horror, horror—curses, curses fall Upon thy nation—was it not enough To drag me from a father's arms, to force me All-shudd'ring to the conqueror's hated bed? Must the same grave receive us?—Save me, save me. BARD. Lady, the law must be obeyed, I cannot. MOINA. Is there no help?— Is there no arm to save, no breast to pity? BARD. Death cannot be avoided. MOINA. Carril, Carril, Is this our promis'd joy? accurst forebodings, And did ye raise our souls to plunge them deeper In horror's night?—Father, father—no more— Soon wilt thou meet me—soon will Carril hail His faithful Moina in the cloudy hall Of ghosts—haste, haste beloved men.— God of my fathers, rise and aid my soul, Revenge, revenge my blood, and— BARD. Lady, no more, I must command obedience. [Leads her off. Harold's body is carried by his soldiers across the stage, Moina follows; the Bards stop and sing the funeral song. CHORUS. Who steps on the glittering bridge That leads to the mansion of gods? 'Tis Harold—undaunted in fight, He smil'd at the shivering of spears, He fell in the clashing of arms. Rise, Odin, rise, See, he enters thy shining abodes And terrible sits by thy side. Who lifts the gold-tipp'd horn Of sparkling mead? Harold lifts the gold-tipp'd horn Of sparkling mead. Andrimner's bubbling cauldron Andrimner was perpetually employed in boiling Serimner's flesh. feeds The happy gods, Harold joins the joyous band And feasts on food divine. Happy he who fighting falls, Happy in the battle's clangor To feel the quivering dart. When the hunter's spear has pierc'd The roe-buck's mottled side, Down from the summit of the rock He falls, and falling dies; His dark grey eyes for ever close, No more he sees the grassy hill, No more he seeks the gushing spring, But sinks to endless night. When Vithri A name of Hela, or Death. drives the singing spear Deep in the hero's steel-clad breast, His soul immortal mounts on high And climbs the airy hall of gods; There in Pleasure's lap he lies 'Till Surtur's flames consume the world. From the four regions of the sky The most striking parts of the following description of the twilight of the gods are taken from Mallet's Northern Antiquities. Vol. II. p. 159. and Sæmund's Edda Vafthrudnismal. liii. The white snow falls, And Winter binds in thick ribb'd ice The floating world— Who rears the bloody hand? A brother in his brother's heart Has plung'd the spear. Who rears the bloody hand? A father in his daughter's heart Has plung'd the spear. Where are thy beams, O sun? Where is thy silver shield, O moon? The glittering stars fall from the cope of heav'n— 'Tis darkness all—the firm earth shakes, The lofty mountains crashing rush Upon the plains below— Old Ocean heaves his waves, And tempests howl around. See Fenris bursts his chain Fenris was an enormous and terrible wolf bound in chains till the last day, when he was to escape and attack the gods. His eye-balls flash, His nostrils breathe Consuming fire. From the Serpent's iron jaws The serpent's name was Midgard, he was twisted round the whole earth, and was to break loose at the last day as well as Fenris. Floods of poison roll— Hark—the crash of heav'n, It cleaves, it cleaves, Spirits of fire arise And hurl their burning brands, Surtur at their head, Before him flash his dazzling arms, Behind him flies resistless flame. Heimdal lifts the brazen trump Heimdal was the centinal of Valhalla, and god of the sky. And blows a war denouncing blast, Heaven's solid pillars shake— Odin hears—he grasps his spear And rears his golden shield— Heimdal sounds the brazen trump— The gods start up and seize their glittering arms. Heimdal sounds the brazen trump— Odin's heros rush to battle, And clash their sounding shields. Them among shall Harold stand Foremost in their glittering ranks, His arm shall wing the hissing dart Nor dread the flames around; Then shall he fighting fall again, And sink amid the war of gods, Amid the crush of worlds.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Enter Bards returning from the Grave. CHORUS. Dark, dark is Moina's bed, On earth's cold lap she lies; Where is the beauteous form Which heroes lov'd? Where is the sparkling eye, The blushing cheek? Cold, cold is Moina's bed. And shall no mournful lay With solemn murmurs sooth Her parted soul? Shall beauty fall unmourn'd? Shall no tear wet the grave Where Moina lies? The bards shall raise the solemn song, The bards shall sooth her parted soul, And drop the tear of grief On Moina's grave. The lily bows its head Before the passing gale, The green earth kissing, But swift the passing gale is fled, Again the fair flower rears her snowy pride And drinks the air serene.— Before the breath of woe The soul of Moina bow'd, It bow'd and rose no more. High o'er its banks the rapid river swells And flows impetuous on the plain— The poplar meets its rushing waves And bows its tender stem— The waters pass, The plant uprears its bended trunk And shoots aloft; The plant uprears its verdant tufts, And spreads its light green leaves To meet the warmth of heav'n. Before the tide of woe The soul of Moina bow'd, It bow'd and rose no more. Frea from Valhalla's groves Mark'd the grief of Moina's soul And dropp'd the golden tear Frea's tears were sabled to be drops of gold., Now she quits the groves of bliss, And hastes to meet her favour'd child Habebat, says Keyster, etiam Frea palatia sua quibus defunctas excipiebat. To this palace of Frea virgins, and wives who had died with their husbands, were admitted. See also Edda Sæmundar. Grimnismal xiv. At heav'n's lofty gates. With her rosy hand she grasps Moina's clay-cold palm, Swift thro' her frame cœlestial vigour shoots, Cœlestial beauty beams In Moina's eyes. Fair flower, no more the blasts of woe Shall shake thy tender form, Secure in Frea's groves Thy bloom shall fade no more. FIRST BARD. Did'st thou not notice, e'er the grave was clos'd On Moina, that she beckon'd to her servant And whisper'd him? Quick thro' the crowd he struggl'd And vanish'd from our sight— SECOND BARD. I did, and wonder'd much what care intruding Could for a moment draw her thoughts from death; 'Till then in silent grief she stood, her eyes Fast rooted on the ground. FIRST BARD. And when the earth Was cast upon her as we held her struggling By Harold's side, she call'd aloud on Carril— CARRIL. (Entering in haste.) Who calls on Carril? speak, ye wretches, speak, Where is my Moina? BARD. Moina is no more, She lies by Harold's side.— CARRIL. Inhuman monsters— Lightnings, lightnings blast thy cursed nation— Lead me to Moina's grave, haste, haste, perhaps She yet may breathe, her bosom yet— BARD. Be calm. CARRIL. Ye wretches lead me to the grave, once more I'll clasp her cold cold breast, kiss her pale lips, And perish with my Moina. BARD. With thy Moina? CARRIL. Yes, she was mine, till thy accursed chief. God of my fathers, thou hast slain the robber— Till thy accursed chief in sorrow dragg'd her To these detested walls—I am her lover— I am Carril— BARD. Carril! CARRIL. Yes, wretches, yes— Moina, Moina, think not to fall alone, I haste to meet thee, Carril hastes to join Thy gloomy ghost; soon shall our airy forms A mournful conference hold, ride on the blast And hover o'er our country—there we'll trace Thy father's steps—together will we haunt The well known hills, and listen to the torrent— The aged bards shall sing our mournful tale— We'll bend our feeble forms and listening catch The soothing sounds of woe.—I come, my Moina, With steps of speed I'll seek the rock's high summit And plunge to death below The practice of suicide was neither unfrequent, nor dishonourable among the Northern nations. Mortem accersunt et voluntario interitu castigant obeundi tarditatem: quos satietas tenet vitæ de rupe nota præcipitem casum in maria destinant. Hoc sepulturæ genus optimum arbitrantur. Solinus, de Hyperboreis. Cap. 16. Both Pliny and Pomponius Mela agree with this account of Solinus.. CHORUS OF BARDS. When from the foe's bright spear The soldier trembling turns, When cold fear shakes his frame And blasts his strength, No more he'll hear the song of praise, No more he'll tell his listening child The bloody tale of war; The gloomy vale receives His slow and sullen steps; He hates the warrior's eye, He hates the maiden's look. Then let shame his bosom fire, Lead him to the lofty rock, And plunge him from the airy height. To death below. When the hero's hardy frame Neque senibus neque morbidis permissum vivere: sed ubi gravis ætas, aut valetudo deterior, tenebantur ipsi supplicare propinquis ut se ærumnis eximerent. Procopius Goth. Hist. Lib. 2. Mirus amor populo, cum pigra incanuit ætas, Imbellos jamdudum annos prævertere saxo. Sil. Italicus. Lib. 3. With lingering sickness droops, When his broad and sinewy arm Shrunk and trembling fails, When that firm breast which dar'd the dart The sighs of languor heaves, When those bold knees which rush'd to war Tottering sink beneath his weight, When death has rais'd his clay-cold hand To touch the warrior's heart, Then let him drag his feeble limbs To some high rock's projecting cliff, And from the airy summit plunge To death below. When from the aged father's arms The blooming child is torn, Forlorn he wanders on the heath, His white hair waving in the wind— Forlorn he seeks the hill His child has trod, And wipes the falling tear; Anguish gnaws his heart, And slowly drags his feeble frame To Hela's halls— Haste, haste and seek the lofty rock, There from its airy summit plunge To death below. When the lover clasps His mistress dead, Cleaves to her cold cold breast Her pale lips kissing, No more her blue eyes tell The tale of love, No more her silver-sounding voice Shall murmur in his ear— In speechless agony he hangs upon her— Awake, awake, and from that form belov'd Snatch thy distracted soul, Haste, haste and seek the lofty rock, There from its airy summit plunge To death below.
