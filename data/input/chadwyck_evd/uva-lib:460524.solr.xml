      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. —The Temple of Bacchus, Calydon. Anaitis and other Mænads asleep on the steps. Enter Coresus. Coresus. She sleeps: what wearied wildness in that arm That crowns the head above the twisted vine's Noon-faded leaves! Spent agitation gives Strange calmness to her face. There is no calm Like that upon the sea after the wind Hath frenzied its blue breast,—as prophecy The bosom of a Pythoness,—and passed. She wakes and gathers up diffused dark limbs, Springing from slumber as a wild beast springs Forth from its lair. Anaitis. Coresus! Coresus. Snatch not up The thyrsus with so tremulous a grasp! To-night there is high revel in the hills, Mystic assembly in the deep recess Of cloven altitudes; meanwhile, for rest The women lie in heaps about the court, Their dappled fawn skins laid aside for heat, Their ruined wreaths of scarlet briony And fennel-staves lying athwart the limbs, That gleam the clearer in the glow of sleep. So shall they stay till eventide. What dream, Anaitis, thus hath broken thy repose? Anaitis. A dream I had—the altar!—Drops of gore! Coresus. Ay, thou rememberest how the hinds were torn In the last chase. Dione cried to see The fleecy fringes of her nebris dyed In blood, and fled. Then didst thou catch her hair, And fling her, as a slender ivy-wand, Amid the bloody fragments. Thought of this,— Her horror, thy o'erhasty violence,— Hath trampled with rough footstep on thy rest. Anaitis. It was the altar: one for sacrifice Was kneeling. Coresus. Yea, Dione, suppliant Beneath thy chastening hand. Anaitis. Dione! No. It was thy blood, Coresus, was the priest's! Coresus. Would the god suffer it? Anaitis, wake, Be sober; I have work for thee to do! Go forth, and to the maids of Calydon Break the rich tidings that I bore to thee. Anaitis. Whom dost thou seek to gather to our band? Coresus. I know two maidens. One is Nephele, The daughter of Megillus, a fleet roe, Tethered, as goat, to graze, pulling the cord, Not pasturing. Go, loose, and bring her here. Anaitis. An easy task. . . . Coresus. Not therefore meet for thee. There is a girl: beside the sycamore, Once when a mighty storm was gathering, She came alone for water to the brook. Her water-pot was rested on a ledge Of stone, and she, her large arms rounding it, Was looking up. From the cerulean The glittering fire outbroke. It played on her; I caught her face tempestuous with delight. But momently I looked on her; the crowd was gathering, The swarthy bull was waiting for the knife, And, ere the heavier thunder shook the shrine, Its neck was severed. O Anaitis, there Is the true Mænad! The wide difference 'Twixt love and love, and oh! the wider room 'Twixt pieties! from the profaner sort That wreathes its victim as it roasts its flesh, With the same hands, same temper; then the stir, The flutter of fresh life religion brings To common youthful ardour! but the few, Who learn it not from custom, suddenly Behold it, as Narcissus his fair form; Would peril all for its embrace, discern In it the image of the unknown self, And leap to it adoring. Even thus Will that still girl feel the entrancing awe Of the great mysteries. And dare I dream To-night, beneath the silver firs, in sight Of the full-breathing heavens, she shall clasp The thyrsus, loose the honey-golden locks, Give her fair bosom to the breeze, her soul . . . ? Anaitis, win her! Anaitis. Win her for yourself. Coresus. Till now the highest favour I could grant Was to make known my will. Five wandering years As faithful comrade of my rest and march Thou hast been with me, not incapable Of lofty energies, needs, sympathies, Beyond thy sex. Now I behold thee shrink, Shrink to mere woman in thy jealousy. No helpful comrade, a base sycophant, Whom one must bribe. Anaitis. 'Tis false. My thyrsus bears A steely summit and my breast is soft; Thus will I slay Coresus' sycophant! Coresus. Mad fury! stay thine hand! Anaitis. And dost thou care, Care that Anaitis bleed not? Coresus. Well, that day The panther caught thee in his hungry paw, I slew him; but I do not care to herd With beasts as fierce as he, perfidious! Anaitis [crouching at his feet]. My master, pardon! thou didst rescue me. Dost keep still the great scar. Coresus. Look not so wild! Thou shalt not seek to move Callirrhoë, Who wouldst but fright her with thy maniac face, The sweetly-ordered one! But if to-night The bright-cheek'd Nephele join not the dance, Thou shalt endure still harder words of me. Anaitis. And if I bring her? Coresus. I will consecrate To Dionysus. That is thy reward. [Exeunt. Scene II. —Callirrhoë's Home. She is spinning. Callirrhoë (sings). Ay, twirl the spindle, twirl it round, The spindle with the dark wool wound! But, maiden, if too well you spin, Or twist the threaded purple thin With deftest finger, think, oh! think Of her whose web of snowy link, Deject Arachne, hangs above. See that the gods thy spinning love. [Enter Nephele.] What mean these crimson vine-leaves round thy feet, My Nephele? Why is thy hair unbound, Thy polished cheek rent with the bramble scar, And thy bright lips discoloured? What! In tears? Nephele. Callirrhoë, oh! hide me in thy gown; It is so perilous a grief, a shame So wild and strange that I must tell thee of; I tremble to remember it, and more To tell it open-faced. To the red bower Of oleander, by the forest-stream, Where thou and I in girlish solitude So oft have hidden for sweet conference, I went, and looking up, saw—not thy clear Calm brows, Callirrhoë—a face as bright As burnished shield, with hair that looked alive, And cloak of shining hide. I lay as still As if a leopard couched there; but she came, The wondrous creature, threw her spells on me, And emptied my young heart as easily As from a pomegranate one plucks the seeds. And then she drew me, in caressing arms, By secret pathways, to the temple-gates, Where stood Coresus. Callirrhoë. The new Bacchic priest? My father likes him not, thinks that the gods, In scorn of mortal insolence, connive At this chaotic fury in men's wits. Nephele. Callirrhoë, had you been there I think You would have saved me. It seemed different When great Coresus turned and looked on me. He is himself a god. He beckoned me, As the mild bull Agenor's child. We drank; I let him loose and wreathe my hair alone. He asked me—had I strength to dedicate Myself to the delivering god. I felt The Mænads gather round me. I was doomed, And as a bride, half-swooning in the flare Of Hymen's torches is borne blindly off, I was caught up by the great choric throng, And in a daze of wonder found myself Whirling the thyrsus. . . . It may be I swooned. When I awoke it was quite still. I thought To creep home quietly, but my strange dress, And a deep shame and wonder at myself, Made me seek shelter with thee. Callirrhoë. Yes, thou shalt Rest thee in mine own bed, and afterwards I will anoint thy cheeks and braid thy hair, Thou foolish child; and when less piteous Thine aspect, I will give thee thy full due Of blame. Now to my room. [Exeunt. [Re-enter Callirrhoë.] (Sings.) Ah, Eros does not always smite With cruel shining dart, Whose bitter point with sudden might Rends the unhappy heart,— Not thus for ever purple-stained, And sore with steely touch, Else were its living fountain drained Too oft, and overmuch. O'er it sometimes the boy will deign Sweep the shaft's feathered end:— And friendship rises, without pain, Where the white plumes descend. Well, I must scold her for her wilfulness, And take her back, in penitence and tears, To her old tasks. My spindle strikes the ground. How strong of brain and heart perforce must be The Fates who spin our lives, from the confused And tangled mass of Destiny withdrawing Fibres that form the web of our existence. Oh! work terrific, solemn! Yet I'd be A kind fate to my brother and my sire. This thread should be the love of Nephele. For when Emathion tells her father's praise, “Not Omphale more cunning at the loom.” And when I question archly—“Thou the god Caught in her toils?” he turns from me and laughs. And for my father. . . . But necessity Dominates fate! Then is it well, indeed, I cannot spin their lives for those I love; Else had I died sooner than twist the black, Thick thread of blindness through my father's days. I wish Emathion would come! 'Tis late. “See that the gods thy spinning love.” [Noise without.] 'Tis he, my glorious brother, radiant From the palæstra. [Enter Emathion.] Emathion. At the spindle still, My nimble-fingered, grave Callirrhoë? Like feast day, I put by the work. The gods Love not late spinning. Callirrhoë. I have nearly done. Be patient, for I'm spinning you your life. Twisting such threads of deep-dyed happiness, As might inspire with proud impiety, And ruin you. Emathion. What doom hangs in this thread? Say, does the fibre run along with gold? Callirrhoë. A thing more precious. Emathion. Health, strong-sighted age, Still beautiful? Callirrhoë. Nay, will you urge me still? Emathion. I'll threaten you ere long. Callirrhoë. Well, 'tis the love Of Nephele. Good brother, you were warned, And now!—But where's our father, for at noon Your careful hand was guardian to his steps That would to town? You have not left him lone, Sightless among the crowd of seeing men? Emathion. I left him chatting with a hoary friend Of tedious, ancient days, of unknown wars, And men, whose names were but a link of sounds Unto my recent ears. 'Tis wonderful How old men when together will re-thrash The out-thrashed past! Callirrhoë. I know that age's tardy converse, dull With iterated stale experience, Chafes youth's hot-blooded moods as station'd rock The running stream. 'Tis easier far for me, Who lead so still a life, to keep from fret; The lake is always quiet round the stone. Emathion, forgive; but the old man Complains he rarely sees you with his hand, Who wast his eyes' great object. Oftener Be near to him. . . . Emathion. Poor father, I will sit My hand in his when next he fills the hearth. Callirrhoë. My kind Emathion! I dare not pass The door, now darkness mixes with the light, Like dark wine spreading through clear water, yet I'm ill at ease. Our father should be here. 'Tis growing dark, oh, not for him! But still 'Tis late. Emathion, step out and look. Emathion. Callirrhoë, He told me I might leave him. Callirrhoë. Yes, I know. [Exit Emathion. So beautiful, So gentle and so kind! I'm glad I told About my father's plaint. Poor old blind eyes, That cannot see him in his loveliness, Most pity-worthy is your lack of sight! I'm tired of spinning! In the viny sweeps Of sunshine on the hills, if a god lurk, Deliverer of women from their toil In household darkness to the broad sweet light, Do they so ill to flee to him for joy? “Can it be meant,” I often ask myself, “Callirrhoë, that thou shouldst simply spin, Be borne of torches to the bridal-bed, Still a babe's hunger, and then simply die, Or wither at the distaff, who hast felt A longing for the hills and ecstasy?” The fair twinned sister of the Delian Must empty the rich passions of her heart Where purple arbute-boughs encompass her, In safest silence, or the bosky oak Lets not a sigh escape. She must be mute, The fair twinned sister of the Delian. For him, the sunshine and the song; for her, The virgin lip and the inviolate shade. Hear me, thou holy Huntress, and protect My thoughts from lawless wandering beyond bound Of thy own sacred precincts. Steps! of two! Dear father! [Enter Machaon and Emathion.] Machaon. He is safe at Cleitophon's. I came lest you should fear, and on my way I met my friend. Callirrhoë. My kind Machaon, thanks! I own that anxious fear had just looked in At door o' my heart. But enter. Emathion. Yes, I'd have These Mænads cleared away. I hate their cries. Machaon. As peacock-shrieks at night. Emathion. I hate their wild Contorted forms. Machaon. Like pines on Cithæron. Your sister goes for water to the stream That makes your doorway pleasant at all hours. A rare and lusty maiden! Why, the jar Sits on her head with firmer majesty Than Rhea's towery crown. Lo, she returns, With red and watery fingers, and a pot Filled justly to the brim. Callirrhoë, Give me a draught! Callirrhoë. The little twy-eared bowl— Emathion, fetch it. Emathion. I don't know its place. Callirrhoë. I'll go. [Exit. Machaon. 'Tis pity you're too old to learn (To Callirrhoë, who re-enters). A cup-bearer to whom the gods should rise. And now I've risen, I must straightway home. My mother had my supper on the board— A quail! I have not told you that I met Megillus—in his head a thunder-storm, Of which the lightning flashed from out his eyes. It seems his daughter's made off to the hills. Emathion. Never! Machaon. Why, cheeks are Tyrian in a trice, Emathion? Well, well! good-bye, fair friend. [Exit. Callirrhoë. Brother, 'tis true. She lies upon my bed. She was deceived, is sorry. Take her home. If you would take her home, she might be spared From punishment and tears—two gloomy blights You should protect your rose from. Emathion. She has thorns. I will not meet her parents. Callirrhoë. Fetch her nurse. Emathion. She ill deserves protection, yet in this I'll be her slave to-night. Callirrhoë, I threw the discus far beyond the rest. Callirrhoë. I'm very glad. Emathion. You only love too much Your idle brother. I must have a kiss! You were too dread for touch of mortal lip While you were spinning Fate. [Exit. Callirrhoë. The twilight falls In showers of darkness. She will tell me all The mystery of the effulgent night, Up in the bluer dark among the stars, Will Nephele. They say the new god shares Pan's maziest secrets in deep fellowship; That the birds speak and even the brooks reveal The thoughts of their clear currents. Every day I fill my pitcher by the bubbling stream, Close to the sycamore. It seems a girl Full of sweet impulse. I would gather her To my still bosom, and receive her love; But we are sundered. What if this new god Of the warm vineyards and the budding trees Could draw her trembling spirit to the brink? It cannot be; Else had our fathers known and worshipped him. I reverence my father's old grey head; I reverence antiquity, the hoar Aspect of Time. What folly to revere The headstrong, blustering present, Time's untrained, Immodest youth! The elder age alone, With Nestor-like authority, can hush To-day's rough disputants. I hear its voice Proclaiming the eternal pieties These Mænads have be-mocked. I'll wake the child, Ere my thoughts grow too angry; strip from her The ivy meshes, cleanse her lips from stain, And dress her in white vesture meet for maid. [Exit Scene III. —Beneath a sycamore tree. Callirrhoë resting. Enter Coresus at a distance. Coresus. How beautiful The face, how fixed in its forlorness, wan As Ariadne, when she kept the coast Of Naxos, ever straining for a sail. Ay, but Eleleus sought her with acclaim, Crowned her, and set her bride-wreath in the stars. Oh, how I love her! how I burn for her! And yet I fear her obstinate as him From whom as from the grape its purple coat Iacchus tore the skin. Heaven ravish her! Coresus is too weak. Callirrhoë, I seek for a strayed maiden, Nephele Her name, a bearer of the Bacchic reed, Lost on the hills last night. I oft have seen Ye two together on the temple-steps Or washing at the brook. Where is she fled? Callirrhoë. She's safe within her father's house, ashamed Of her wild yester-revel and revolt From seemliness and maiden modesty. Seek not again to capture her! Coresus. I seek To ransom, not enslave, Callirrhoë, Calling all men to the Deliverer. Look in mine eyes, and say if servitude Be not your daily portion. Can you set Your limbs free to the rhythm of your soul? Is there a passion in you that dare speak? Are not your bosom's offspring, young desires, Served to you mutilate, a sick'ning food By the world's impious custom? Spurn the feast As the Divinity the Libyan dish! Callirrhoë. These are wild words, bewildering to the brain. Coresus. As heaven's inrush. Be brave, Callirrhoë; Ask yourself have you not a deeper need Than the stale rites of customary gods Can satisfy? and speak in earnestness. Tell me about yourself! Callirrhoë. I oft have longed For speech with the dark sea and glittering hills, For stories of the world, for wider care And love of creatures other than myself. Can your god give me these? Coresus. He came to bring Life, more abundant life, into a world That doled its joys as a starved city doles Its miserable scraps of mummying bread. He came to gladden and exalt, all such Must suffer. Call men to the battle, swords Clash the response; bid them arouse themselves From foolish habit, customary sloth, In bestial ignorance of your intent, They trample, tear you. Dionysus thus Suffered; he still endures at Calydon Men's insolence in his rejected priest— Though founder of fair laws, of citied life, And guide to the untrodden paths of peace. Callirrhoë. The potent rioter! Of old the gods Gave culture by the harp, the helm, the plough, Not by the ivy-wand. Coresus. Seems it so strange That Semele's sublime audacity Should be the origin of life urbane? We must be fools; all art is ecstasy, All literature expression of intense Enthusiasm: be beside yourself. If a god violate your shrinking soul, Suffer sublimely. Callirrhoë. Yet I hold it true, Divinity oft comes with quiet foot. Coresus. To give a moment's counsel or to guard From instant peril. When a god forsakes Olympus to infuse divinity In man's mean soul, he must confound, incite, O'erwhelm, intoxicate, break up fresh paths To unremembered sympathies. Nay, more, Accompany me further in my thought,— Callirrhoë, I tell you there are hours When the Hereafter comes and touches me O' the cheek. I see the triumph of the King, The gleaming crag of the Acropolis, The mustered city spectatorial Of vast emotion on the hollowed hill. In the midst the Bromian altars. Oh, he sways That peopled amplitude, that press of life, With so intense a tyranny he holds The reins of its very breath. Men may not stand Beholding, when the conflict's at the heat; The event's cold ere it reaches them. There, there They watch as mothers watch their wrestling sons, Fell Mora with humanity in clutch, The dying hero with the victor lip, The lordless creature, dominant and lone. Callirrhoë. I tremble at your god, for terrible In wrath I fear him; though you speak him fair. I surely know That he provokes men to unnatural deeds, And once stirred frenzied mother as a fell Tigress to murder her deluded son. Coresus. More shalt thou hear; more horrible detail Of the avenger. Of a churlish king Sudden he seized the recreant body, lashed Its members severally limb by limb To horses fleeter than strong Phœbus reins; Nor shuddered when the dull Edonian Left a mere sputtering trail behind the hoofs. Callirrhoë. Peace, peace, Coresus; he will bring us woes, Woes on my father, on Emathion, On Calydon, my city, if he bears A breast so ruthless. I will hear no more. Coresus. Turn not away, Callirrhoë; by goads The ox-souled must be driven; yield response To Heaven's desire of thee; love humanly. Love is the frenzy that unfolds ourselves; Before it seize us we are ignorant Of our own power as reed-bed of the pipe. The rushes sang not; from Pan's burning lips Syrinx sucked music. Wert thou lute to love There were a new song of the heaven and earth. I have been foolish frighting thee with things Too wonderful for a soul-snooded girl To bear the thought of; think of them no more; Think but of me, no veiled divinity, Coresus, a mere man, a suppliant Clasping your knees in his extremity; Craving the alms of your great love, and yet Withal so ravenous at heart, he scarce Can bide the time of his petitioning. Callirrhoë. I have not loved— Coresus. Till now. You cannot say You love not. Callirrhoë. That I will not yield my love To Bacchic priest, I can. From earliest days I have been trained in the old pieties; And oft 'mid common household work have smiled To think how like the blessèd gods my hands From chaos could educe a tiny world Of perfect order. My dear father's peace I will not wreck, as Nephele; he ne'er Shall miss his daughter at the evening board, Nor sadder, find her truant to herself, Indocile, indolent. It cannot be That any but a mocking messenger Can come in Heaven's name to set the child Against the parent. Coresus. As unseasoned wood That smokes and will not kindle is flung by For any refuse purpose, while the train Of torchlight sinuous winds among the hills, A starry serpent, so art thou cast out, An apathetic slave of commonplace, Sluggish and irreceptive of true life, From all high company of heavenly things. Go to your home. Callirrhoë. Oh Heaven shelter it! Coresus. Go home, Callirrhoë; ask if all be well Within the city: do not fear men's looks, Or any whispering about the streets. The temple-rites reclaim me; from your loom You have been too long absent. Go in peace. [Exeunt severally. Scene IV. —A Bower in a Garden. Enter Emathion. Emathion. How beautiful is life and youth and love; How fair are girls and boys—how more than fair My Nephele! Her brow is of as clear and warm a whiteness As a young egg that lies in the dove's nest! She comes! I'll hide! [Hides. [Enter Nephele.] Nephele. He is not here. Naughty Emathion. Emathion [apart]. But only just outside. Nephele. It is unkind! He vow'd to keep his time. Emathion [aloud]. And only kept his vow. Nephele. You naughty boy! Emathion. If you will call him good, he'll break his vow, And run away directly. Nephele. Naughty boy! Emathion. If you will call him good, he'll keep his vow, And come and sit by you. Nephele. He's a good boy. Emathion. Look at those roses, they are near each other, And what do they keep doing? Nephele. Nothing much. Emathion. Why, lightly touching. Nephele. There's a wind that makes them. Emathion. Love be our wind! [Kisses her. Nephele. There's some one stepping past. 'Tis Hylia and her father. Hylia. He hath asked, Hath asked my love. Acephalus. He is an amorous youth! Go wed—but don't forget old father, girl. Hylia. Oh no, nor mother. I will come across And kiss you every morning. Acephalus. Do not cry. Astynous, if he saw, would think I said You should not marry him, and yet he'd see It was not rain of grief, but the first dew O' the dawn of joy. [They pass on. Nephele. I wish my father loved me. He beats me; you won't? Emathion. Beat you! Horrible! I cannot beat a dog. Don't talk of it. Look at that cyclamen!— The little flowery satyr, all white ears. It must not hear of anything but love. I love you—let it hear that you love me. Nephele. I love you. Emathion. Nephele, Thus should life be one chord of youth, love, joy! Scene V. —Temple of Dionysus. Before the Altar. Enter Coresus and Anaitis. Coresus. Gall thrown in sweetest wine will make the cup As bitter as 'twas sweet. Throw poison in, And it is venomous as cockatrice. The goblet of my love holds now a draught 'Twere death to wet the lips with. She has scorned My god, my passion, as she might refuse A gift of oleander some light boy Would lay in her pale bosom. So she spurned The human gift of my man's utter love, So great, it grew Titanic in its bulk, With swelling sinews of immense desire, And laid its own magnificent excess At her feet for her to wonder at and scorn. Woe, woe to her! About the columns booms a shout of woe, Responsive to my menace. 'Tis the god Sealing my malediction. Now instead Of that grand prostrate love, hate's feller form Encounters her—a Herculean power Equipped for vengeance. I will make her quail, Anaitis! Those proud lips that scorned my love Shall blanch and quiver. Dost thou think of it, My love, Anaitis? Anaitis. Ay, an icy girl, With veins that knew not summer. Coresus. With a heart Colder than coldest marble in a vault. Anaitis. Thou hatest her? Coresus. As light-bereaving death. Anaitis. Then let me spread my hair upon her! Coresus. Nay. To tear the lovely branches of her limbs From their white trunk were suffering too small, Too easy. Anaitis. Let me tear her. 'Tis enough. I'm hungry for her. Coresus. Woman-tiger, nay! Thou shalt not tear her. Anaitis. Let me curse her then— Call madness, bid it plunge its scarlet brand Within her brain to burn as stubble. Coresus. Nay. On her no curse; but on her city set Long-famished plague. That curse as flicker cast Athwart the mourner's face from glaring pyre That feeds on what is precious, will evoke Worse agonies than the sharp pangs of death. Anaitis. My arms are lifted upward. Lift up thine. Coresus. I lift them to a god who can chastise. Anaitis. Speak, call, nay shout to Heaven! Coresus. Bacchus, hear Thine injured priest, thou great Revenger, hear! Throughout the city let quick murrain breed; Drive Sleep away from his grim brother Death, And then let Death pass single through the gates. Let hardy limbs grow slack, crook up and fall— Then burn and stiffen. Populate the streets With Hades' ghosts, long, fleshless, pallid men. Let the foul body know no laving hand; And let no flowers touch the hideous face; The mouth receive no coin; no bed be dressed; No jar of water stand before the door. Let the whole city be one house of death, The gates its theshold, and humanity Its single corpse. Be Vesta's flame extinct, While ravening funereal fires leap high Fierce from consuming corpses. Let strange fear Flap wings unseen that beat upon the heart Bestilling it with terror. Thus revenge! Anaitis. Hear! Coresus. Hear! [Thunder and lightning. Anaitis. The lightning flares, the thunder rolls! Coresus. Our prayer is heard! Anaitis. And granted by the god. Coresus. Dreadful the “yes” of the omnipotent. Anaitis. Silence, not thunder, were a dreadful thing. Coresus. The tomb is wide as mouth of tragic mask. Anaitis. Wide for the god's and for thine enemies. Coresus. Io triumphe! Io! for the sign! Anaitis. The silence is as dreadful as when corpse With all the wailing women hath been borne Away, and the house echoes to no step Or voice. Coresus. And in this silence it may be That Destiny receives within her womb Plague; and ere night descend— The rapid birth may be accomplish'd—Doom Rent by Fulfilment, and, 'mid human shrieks, The slaughterous child of wrath be recognised. During the throes of the great birth, my brain Is restless. I must rove, I cannot rest. Anaitis. Woe to the arms that first receive the child. Coresus. Woe to the city of whose life 'tis heir! [Exeunt severally. Scene VI. —A Wood. Enter Dione. Dione. Oh, the deep woods! I feel they hide within their inmost hearts Some strange and thrilling secret, mighty, dark, Unshared by mountain, sea, or Heaven's self. My childhood felt its burthen when the shade Of the green darkness grew about the path I followed for dropt nut or lonely bloom. Oh, to be friend to the great forest, earn Its trust, and penetrate its green reserve! Within the bosky dells, And breathless gloom of the dense leaves, I've grown Familiar with the gentle happy fauns, And mystic dryads with dun crowns of oak. Yet these too share the mystery of their woods, They feel it, round their simple lips it lurks, But cannot take expression.—Angry steps Crack the curled arbute-leaves upon the ground. The feet are brown! I'm very lonely here! Coresus! but I tremble at his brow. Coresus. Ye gods! A hurricane is raging in my heart, And shaking the foundations of my life Almost to ruin. Round me all is still, So still, I could throw up my arms and beat The bushes till they whirled, only to make What is without me more like that within. To think the vaulted world holds not a breeze, And all its winds are packed into this heart! Come, storm; come, crackling gale and tempest, come! I'd bear the wild contention of my breast. But outer calm, dark green serenity, Coo of a ring-dove; it is maddening, Provocative of torment and impatience That makes the torment worse! Dione [aside]. It is a song! Who sings thus timely? 'Tis a little faun Coresus loves, with buoyant happiness Almost in flight. I'll slip away and watch. [Hides at a distance. Faun (singing). Down the forest-path I fled, And follow'd a buzzing bee, Till he clomb a foxglove red. He filled full the nodding cup; I stood and I laughed to see; Then closed it and shut him up, Till I laughed and set him free. O master, master, I have had great game, And I have laughed and laughed until I cried, And laughed again, to have him safely there, The bee within a blossom; for I tried To catch him, and he flew so fast before, I could not, till he dropt his wings and crept Up the tubed foxglove. Master, you are glad? Coresus. My silly faun, glad that thou hadst thy wish; Would that a flower encompassed mine, and not A stricken city! A blossom holds a bee, a city plague. My childish faun immures the murmuring bee, I the malignant plague. How far apart, How sundered by such difference of choice, Are he and I! Faun. I'm tired. Coresus. And yesterday We gathered chestnuts and our laughter mixed! Faun. Listen, you do not listen; I am tired. Coresus. I hear! Ha, boy, thine eyes agaze! Laugh, boy! Thou wilt not laugh? Thy face was cut for smiles. Faun. I love you. Coresus. Pretty faun, methinks thou dost. Faun. I had a little heap o' hazel nuts I counted underneath the silver fir. A squirrel came, his tail along his back, And looked at me until I gave him half. Coresus. 'Twas a bold squirrel!—O my god, my god! Scatter my wild prayer, even as the wind Disperses foam the wrathful sea uplifts. Scatter it thus! Oh, I was deeply moved! Had I no cause?—no cause? That could not be. I suffered scorn, insufferable wrong, Shame ineffaceable! I marked her mouth, I saw it push out as a bud of rose; It parted into blossom, and for scent I got a taunt, still in my nostrils rank. I'll give her fragrance, smell of rotting friends; She shall draw in the odours of sweet death. She shall—But tell me of the pigeon's nest. Faun. Why, yester-morn an egg lay on the twigs, On the hard twigs. I pitied it, and laid it on the moss At foot o' the tree. This morning it was cold; And so I pitied it again, and put It back. To-morrow I shall find it warm. Shall I not, master? Coresus. Yes.—She would not love A Bacchic priest, she said. Because I serve Religion am I then unfit for Love? What! does religion blurr the face or dwarf The stature, lame the feet, or make one shoulder O'ertop the other? Because I strike with sacrificial knife, A woman stabs my honour with her tongue. Because I pour libations to the god, A woman empties all her scorn on me. A priest's love, like a sinewless old hound, Is kicked aside! My office is a brand That stamps me despicable in the eyes Of the one being I have ever loved To my love's height and stretch of my heart's arms.— And is the ant-hill busy? Faun. Yes, indeed. The ants are busy day and night, and yet I think they're sometimes idle, for they run About my hand and to and fro; I call That play, and laugh at them. Coresus. She scorned the priest, Then did she scorn the god. My wrath is holy, Sacred and priestly. Ay, Callirrhoë, Priestly, I say. Faun. You're dull as the old owl, Who, when I dance, looks straight before his beak, And, when I laugh, turns round his eye on me! I do not like the owl. Coresus. Be still, be still. It's growing dark. My heart's a cataract Of whirling blood; my veins are furious channels Of crimson passion. I am drunk with wrath, I stagger, and the trees appear to writhe. What, have they got the plague? And all the people Will writhe their arms like that? Faun. I wonder if the woodpecker would cease His knocking to the dryad in the tree If I ran up? Coresus. I wonder if the first Blue corpse is carried out in Calydon. Faun. I'll try his true love for the hidden girl. Coresus. And I will see if any yet be dead. [Exit wildly. Dione [advancing.]. Weep not. He's sad, and doth not love thee less. I'll with thee to the ant-hill. Show the way, And dance along. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. —A Bridal Chamber. Astynous and Hylia. Astynous. O Hylia, my dark and shapely maid, New bound to me as wife—a bliss too great For me to grasp, discovered gold in mass My eager arms are hopeless to contain— O Hylia, thy silence slits my heart With cruel edge. A vague, dark horror rolls Thine eyes, like hunted doe's, and thy touch leaves Hot impress on my sense. My Hylia, Is married love thus fearful, feverous, still? Then curse I Hymen, and would have my wife Maiden once more, that I might woo again. Hylia. Astynous, dear husband! Astynous. Ah, that's well. Speak thus deliciously again. Thy words, Though few, are each a red-ripe, perfect fruit Of speech. A smile! but a mere ghost of such As live where now I kiss! Is it so strange, So fearful to be mine forever? Hylia. Nay, Astynous; in sooth I'm very gay And joyous. Astynous. With sad face; an oracle That hides its import. Hylia. O—h! I'm falling! Astynous. Nay, Requesting an embrace! Ye gods! her head Hangs loose with backward chin! My Hylia, Speak to Astynous! O my bride, my bride! I cannot hold her longer, she must drop, So weighty grows her delicate, slight form. Mother, O mother! Nay, she cannot hear. I'll bear my dreadful burden to her room. O bridal-bed, that will not hold the bride To-night! I shall go mad! It yet may be She faints and will revive to fill these arms Less heavily than now! Ha! I have crushed The myrtle wreath that's tumbled from her hair! I dread the omen! Nay, she'll soon be well. [Exit, carrying her. Scene II. —Callirrhoë's Home. Cephalus before the door. [Enter Callirrhoë.] Callirrhoë. What, lonely, my dear father? When I left Emathion was with you. Cephalus. Hastily He broke from me, my child; that busy youth Evamon, passing by, took hold of him, Swearing he must not miss the eloquence Of Periander, the new sage, who draws, Machaon says, our city's idle youth. The beamy breeze hath grown a little chill, Or loneliness hath something damp'd my heart; Almost I seem in Hades, from the sun Cut off as those sore-sighing ones below. Soothe me, Callirrhoë; thou know'st a strain Of Eos' love. Sing me that song of light! Callirrhoë. If he could see me! Can I trust my voice? That cloud that swift as lizard to its hole Made for the city; it pursued me fast— Is with me here, and on my father's head In gathering volume tarries. (Sings.) To the gods doth Eos bright Bear the tidings of the light; Catching, as the morning steals, At swift Helius' chariot-wheels. But to-day she doth not care What the clouds for livery wear; Dark and dewful are her eyes When the morning sun doth rise; And she sheds still heavier tears As his glory disappears. Smitten by Scamander's bed, Her bright warrior-boy lies dead. She hath washed him in the wave, Deck'd him in a garment brave; But his eyelids, sunk more deep, Settle into marble sleep. She must to the father go With her life-bedark'ning woe. Cephalus. Dear child, there is a trouble in thy voice. Say, art thou weary climbing the long hill? Callirrhoë. Nay, father; for the song is sorrowful.— Oh, could he see! now it is like a web, A mesh of tempest, tangling all the streets In blinding toils!—But listen, I will try The happy end, and we shall both be cheer'd. (Sings.) Clasping the great knees in prayer, She beseeches, “Oh, if e'er, When the shrouding night-clouds flee, Rosy from the reddened sea Sprang thine Eos, grant me this— Leave not my pale boy in Dis.” Then the father faltered—smiled; Eos' blushes saved her child. Cephalus. Oh, the young light! how goldenly it stole In May-time 'mid the glade of budding oaks, When thou did'st gather flowers for Artemis— Thou mindest?—that spring-day six years ago. Callirrhoë. Yes. O my father, let me lead thee back; I fear some great calamity—a cloud Hangs over Calydon. Cephalus. Then will we in, I felt the air unwholesome. Callirrhoë. Father, stay! The heavens press on us, and I dare not move. Cephalus. These sudden showers make the young vineyards swell. Kindly it thunders, we shall have soft rain. Callirrhoë. Nay, there is deadly hurricane, a stir After the stillness, like the whirring wings Of swooping eagle. Let me hide thee! So! Cling close to me. [Enter Demophile.] Demophile. Haste! Little Nephele Is struck with sudden sickness. Come to her. Cephalus. Quickly, my daughter. Callirrhoë. Can I leave him now? My father, trust me, for I know the sign; We lie 'neath Heaven's curse. I have been summoned by the Bacchic priest To worship and to love; rejecting him, He burst upon me with strange threats. Demophile. More woe. Callirrhoë, haste! Sweet Hylia is dead. [Exit. Callirrhoë. Father, I Thy child am wholly subject to thy will. Our Calydon is smitten for my pride; This brood of dreadful cloud—this black descent Of feverous wind. Let me to Bacchus' shrine! I will deny no more Coresus' love, I will entreat him supplicate the god For my dear city, for Emathion, thee, My father. Oh, command me speedily! Cephalus. Nay, child, we suffer for the foolishness That has bewitched this city; drunken heaps Of maddened women have infected it. The babe hath perished, while the mother's breast Has suckled the young panther on the hills. Men, of their wives forsaken, have grown wild, Disordered, hungry, and uncivilized. Apollo sees his sister's shrine desert, Her virgin followers flocking to the hills For all unseemly revel. He descends, Branding the irreligion with the scathe Of Heaven. Fear not, my child, for me; I fear My father's gods, and to their care commend My daughter. Hark! Another urging foot Is here! [Re-enter Demophile.] Demophile. Haste, ere the little one be dead. [Exeunt. Scene III. —The Market Place. Cleitophon, Megillus Acephalus, Machaon, Emathion, citizens. Machaon. Idle i' the market-place! 'Tis no time for talk. We must all work. Our wealth in dead cannot be counted, so fast and faster does Plague's impress give them currency. 1st Cit. Ay, but the elders meet. Peace. Peace! He continues— Cleitophon. For all along the way my course was choked With issue—thick as concourse, when the crowd Gathers for some high festal sacrifice— Of black'ning corpses. Men cried out to me: “You who have wisdom, dwelling near the gods, Learn if neglected hecatomb or rite, In ignorance polluted, is revenged By this strange glare of sanguine ulcerous death, That sudden paints our bodies, burns, and spreads, And, heating as it travels onward, lights A raging furnace, till the chilly gust Of death creep after and put out the flame. Help us, and we— 2nd Cit. No oration—no periods! Acephalus. Already the corpses drop like birds on the snows of Scythia. 3rd Cit. And death feeds the flames as an eagle her eaglets. Cleitophon. Woe to us! 'Tis the forsaken shrine of Artemis, the withered flowers stretched on the dusty marble, that hath wrought this evil. Acephalus. Fire-brands! Flint, wood, flame! To the temple of the Barbarian! Burn, kill, ravage! Megillus. Now it may just be that the fault is not in the place of your condemnation, that you're beating the grass while the snake's yonder. I would say that the new god may be a god; and then where are we,—aye, and the fruit too! I'm for the Bromian! 4th Cit. Evœ! I'll straight home, chaplet my brow and— Machaon. Be your own corpse-adorner. He falls. Can gentle gods thus disfigure their friends? I'll bear him hence. 4th Cit. Carrion for the flames! [Exit Mac. with Cit. Cleitophon. My words are the streak of light on the dial-plate of council; they mark the course of the time most expressly. [Re-enter Machaon.] Machaon. [to Emath.] You dog me like an avenger. How now? Emathion. Machaon, I am sick. Machaon. As the girl turned pale when Hymen on his marriage-day fell from his house much hurt. Keep from the north side the town, where the wind blows, and you'll live to in-urn us. Emathion. Oh, it blows ill all quarters. Megillus. I've heard it told, by whom I know not, in an impersonal whisper as it were, that Cephalus' tall daughter refused the love of the Bacchic priest, knocked it flat with the hand of her scorn, and 'twas hinted the city is plagued for this behaviour. Acephalus. Then let us give her to his desire! We'll not die that she may pick lovers. Cleitophon. The maid is of my kin, devout and chaste. I'll not have her infamously espoused. He's a brown vine-pole. [Enter Demophile.] Demophile [to Emath.]. Nephele prays you come to her. She's dying, fluttering in the very breast of death, that sorely hurt the little thing in catching it. Come! Machaon. Dost hear, Megillus? Megillus. Business, business! [Exit. Emathion. Don't touch me; go away! Machaon. His light orbs are black, eclipsed with panic, and he's white as ass's milk. Go, forward, nurse. [exit Demophile] Emathion must protect the threatened honour of his sister. Music! [Enter Astynous and a band of revellers.] Astynous. Hail, friends! Death is a glutton we've sworn to pamper with a honeyed dish. We cram us with pleasure to sweeten its gullet. Ivy and ribbons! 'Tis a rare garnish! My bride was snatched from the marriage chamber, a pleasant morsel! I'll not be behind her in flavour when I'm swallowed up. Give me a cymbal! Who'll join us—dance—sing—shout! Strike up, comrades! Eat and drink and twine your flowers, Till we make a feast—not ours! [Exit with revellers. 1st Cit. Choicest bullocks, wide-streaming wine, let us kill and pour before heaven, and call on Artemis for help. 2nd Cit. Nay, let us confess the Bromian with groans and orgies. Machaon. My good friends, counsel is hydra-headed, 'tis authority alone hath unity of brain-power. Seek ye the voice of the godhead that fulfils the oaks of Dodona. 1st Cit. An oracle, an oracle! 2nd Cit. 'Tis wisely spoken; but the way is long. Pestilence keeps not Time's tardy paces. The city will be still ere we receive the message. Cleitophon. Ye are deaf to my words, so 'twere best to seek the Holy Oracle. Emathion [to Mac.]. Methinks I cannot breathe again till I get beyond the gate. Machaon [pointing to Emath.]. Here is a windy-heeled messenger—Hermes-shod. Two years ago his feet swept the way to Dodona; he knows each turn of the road, each ford, bridge, and bye-path. Emathion. I'll go to the very tether of my life to serve you. 2nd Cit. Spoken like a patriot. 1st Cit. 'Tis settled, he goes. Acephalus. At once. No leave-takings! Emathion. Now. [Re-enter Demophile.] Demophile [to Emath.]. You've stayed too long. She's quite still. But your father lies and asks for you as he grips at his vitals. Emathion. Is it the plague? Demophile. I should think it is the plague, if you were to see his face, hot as the dog-star. Emathion [gasping]. No more—go away! [to Mac.] Have you anything to smell? Machaon. Here's a sweet burnt herb for you. Emathion. I can't go to my father. I've promised to seek the oracle, and I've promised to start now, and my father taught me to love my country. Demophile. Very well. You've a milky look for a patriot. There will nowhere be a father for you when you return, you'll be an orphan. I'll get some healthy woman from a clean house to put a little food in a scrip for you. An' to think he'll be an oprhan! [Going. Emathion. Nurse, say I love him—let him know that I love him. And say, nurse, that I was bound to my country. Poor old father, say that his pangs torture me. Say that you saw me go—now. [Exit. All. Zeus be our helper! 1st Cit. A noble youth! 2nd Cit. He slew nature at the foot of his country. He's the boast of Calydon for beauty. Machaon. There's suffusion in the eye of that man's judgment—though the boy's loveliness captivates. His golden head is perfect as Cytherea's apple.—What is it, my good nurse? Demophile. Ægle is restless— Machaon. What! your dear child that makes such trim wreaths? Demophile. Her lap was full o' white violets that kept twitching off. Machaon. I'll with you.—Disperse, friends. Plague, like the wolf, loves a flock. Scatter yourselves, and let confidence rule your pulses. [Exeunt omnes. Scene IV. —Nephele's Home. Callirrhoë with Nephele's body. Callirrhoë. How different from that fair Bacchic sleep From which thou once did'st wake, my Nephele, This hideous lifelessness! Ye gods! instead Of the bright laughter of the dreaming lips A grin is on the sharp, shrunk mouth; the cheek, Moist with the balmy warmth of its own blush, Now glistens beaded with a chilly sweat. Once in delirium, when her speech came thick As blood-clot through the edges of a wound, Some memory of dewy morning-hills I caught in her hot voice. Oh, I must hide thee, bury thee; but first My lips shall touch the cheek that lies against My white robe like a tawny withered rose. She'd cry to think my lips Loathed her that once delighted in her mouth. There, there! [kisses the corpse] Love and the vultures are the only things Death cannot sicken. All are gone from her; Her parents, sisters; and Emathion Came not to comfort her. What could it be Delayed him? Now I need his help. But first I will wind round thee my long veil; he ne'er Shall see thee thus. [Enter Demophile. Demophile. Oh, home, Callirrhoë; Thy father sickens; he may now be dead. [Exeunt hurriedly. Scene V. —Dodona: the sanctuary on an eminence; at some distance the sacred grove of oaks and beeches. Enter Timarete, Nicandra, and Promeneia, who walks apart. Timarete. Observe! Our sister mumbles; nods, and mumbles on. As drivers shake the rein when horses lag, So do we ancient women, with the head Urge our slow tongues. She mumbles to herself. Mark that! Nicandra. I do. Timarete. Observe, her yellow cheek Is bronzy with the mixture of a blush. Nicandra. I've marked it, sister! Timarete. Chew'd it over? Nicandra. Ay. Timarete. Methinks there are unseemly diamond-sparks A-turning in her eyes. Nicandra. I've seen 'em, sister. Like points of light they twinkle in the rheum. Timarete. What is the meaning of 'em? Nicandra. Folly. Timarete. Ha, ha, hi! Nicandra. She never was As ancient, grave, and inaccesible In nature as appearance. Timarete. Say'st thou so? Nicandra. We caught her once in weakness, two years gone. She stood, her dry, old hands so tight, I wondered They broke not into powder; her grey locks Whirled, like the strips of bark when peels the birch, I' the wind! She watch'd a man who left the shrine. I laughed. Timarete. And I. Nicandra. Thou can'st remember it? Timarete. Ay! how she made as she did watch a bird That swept the sky above him. Ha! ha! hi! Nicandra. Methinks it was this boy she watch'd! Timarete. Hi, sister? Nicandra. I say, methinks it was this boy she watch'd. Timarete. Ay, an' he was a boy; light, curling hair Did rib his head all over. Nicandra. An' he came From Calydon to question o' the famine. Timarete. It is the same. Nicandra. Art sure? Timarete. Ay. Promeneia. Would to heaven He'd seen me when my brow was flat and white As cleanly, folded linen! Now 'tis dirty And crumpled up; And there's no washing more for it, no well To make it white; no press to make it flat. Nicandra. 'Tis shameful thus to see the girl peep through The casement of old womanhood. I fain Would cuff the impudent wench in yon old face. Timarete. Ye ancient gods! laugh not, nor jig my sides! Promeneia. This mouth of mine,—its edges now turn back Like those o' withered leaves! He'd kiss my lips? He could not find 'em, they are down my throat. Nicandra. Her dotage doth wax passionate. Timarete. Hi, sister? Nicandra. I say, her dotage doth wax passionate. Timarete. E'en so. Promeneia. Last night he shuddered when Nicandra's Brown immense bosom pushed through its white wraps; Timarete with blue-nailed finger-tip Pointed. He hath not shuddered to my face! Not yet! Nicandra. 'Tis certain we must seek the shrine, Get the response, and thus despatch her boy! Timarete. She puts it off from day to day. Nicandra. Poor crone! So old and light; we'll do't! Timarete. Well said; we'll do't. Promeneia. Youth is the prodigal of golden wealth; The middle term of life becomes a miser, And clutches at the coins which still remain. But old age is a lack-all and a beggar Too foul for pity. Oh, he comes! I blush For my peaked, leathery visage as for sin! He's looking at my straggling chin,—O god! And his so beautiful! [Enter Emathion.] Emathion. My reverend dames, Whose holy mouths make verbal Heaven's will, Again I do entreat that with high Zeus, Th'omniscient Father, ye will hold converse; And learn the cause of the dread pestilence Engulfing human life; what angry god Must be appeased; what hostile altars smoke; What lamentations weary heaven's vault. Ten days I wait; no oracle is given. I shall be cursed, be followed like a child, And found here playing truant, my good name Dishonoured and my faith discredited. I shall be ruined if the god is dumb. Upon my knees I supplicate for grace. Promeneia. What doth he say? Timarete. Turn round thine other ear. Emathion. O venerable sisters, grant my prayer! Promeneia. The day is not auspicious. Nicandra. False you speak. Timarete. 'Twas yesterday. Promeneia. Wrongly you calculate. Timarete. Why, yesterday you said was not auspicious! Promeneia. I did mistake, it was to-day. Timarete. She dates According to her wish. Within an hour We will declare the oracles of Zeus. Promeneia. Oh, not to-day! Oh, not to-day! Good youth Be ruled, and force not heaven! Dreadful things Will be declared; no comfortable word Will issue from the beeches, they will groan Hair-raising horrors, grisly messages. Timarete. Give her no heed, or thou wilt be undone! Nicandra. Be obdurate! Promeneia. He wavers! [clutching him] Dearest youth, I love you, and they hate!—Now he hath shuddered! Emathion. O—h! loose me, hag! Nay, venerable maid, Thy sacred grasp appalled me. I am honoured. Promeneia [aside]. Contemptible old woman! never mutter Love with thy hollow gums and ragged mouth; For love must pass through gates of marbly teeth, And open the red curtains o' young lips! Timarete. A tear is hanging from her peaky nose. Nicandra. I see, I see! Promeneia. I'm jealous of my sisters. At them he shuddered; but he shrieked at me. [She paces apart. Timarete. Young man, Thou did'st not like her skinny fingering? Then seek the oracle! Nicandra. Thou did'st not like her mumble in thine ear? Then seek the oracle! Promeneia What will he say? Emathion. I'll gladly seek it. Timarete. Bring your woolly bough This time an hour. Nicandra. Tremble, and kneel, and pray. Timarete. Come, Promeneia, since your leg is stiff, Here is my hand to help. Promeneia. Malignity. I walk as well as you. [They descend the steps; Prom. falls. Timarete. She's on her shins! Ha! ha! hi! I knew her leg was stiff! Nicandra. Why, any one could see it! Let me rub 'em! Timarete. She wants to rise. [To Emath.] I pray you pick her up. Emathion. Is she hurt? Nicandra. She's crying. Are you hurt, good sister? Promeneia. Hurt, hurt. And yet he cares! Laughable age! Your arm, and let me go! Nicandra. You're humbler, sister! [Exeunt. Emathion. I laugh and curse. Faugh! they are filthy hags! I'm sick at their great feet stuck round with corns, And livid chins which seem to chew their breath. They make me cold; I never was so cold. Good heavens blast me Before I grow like them! One says she loves me! Keep down, disgust! O execrable hag! I shall be ill with thought of her; and then Her filmy eyes will mind me of my father's. I promised once to close them, but 'tis certain Our private promises must snap in twain For country; and my sister Would close them, ('twould have been most horrible To drape the lid over the muddled orb!) He always loved her best. That execrable beldam! If she works Upon me thus, I'm sure to have the plague. I'll think not on her; yet, within an hour I meet her! I'll be firm, get the response And never seek an oracle again! [Exit. Scene VI. Callirrhoë's Home. Callirrhoë. There are who think that ignorance is sin Past pardon, since it is incurable As blindness, when no faculty of sight Is native to the eyes. I thus have err'd Unconsciously, or wherefore could he die, My father? They are mine, these dead. [Enter Machaon.] Machaon. I come With tidings of Emathion. Callirrhoë. He was missed, And missing, at two death-beds. Machaon. I was near Your brother when the word from Nephele Was brought; he shrivelled and turned white, so white I put my arm in his and drew him off. Callirrhoë. And little Nephele, you let her die Without her lover. Machaon. That is aptly said. One coin less to old Chiron. Callirrhoë. Afterwards Did not Emathion hear that suddenly. My father had been stricken? Machaon. Ay, he heard. But there was that about him made me know That if I let him look much on the sick You would be brotherless. Callirrhoë. Why, so I am, Since my dear father on his death-bed found That he was sonless. Silently he lay; But after any stirring at the door,— The neighbours coming in with anxious step,— He felt about among the fleecy wraps For his boy's hand, and being baffled, died. Machaon. Be not too harsh; it is no cowardice, Save on the battle-field, to shrink from death. Fleet-limb'd Emathion from Dodona soon Will fetch the remedy Æsclepiads Are fools at mixing. Had I not prevailed In urging the bewildered silly folk To seek the oracle, you had been led Ere now to Bacchus' altar, to allay The jealous anger of the genial god For scorn of young Coresus. You divine? Callirrhoë. Would they had come and carried me away To be their victim! Machaon. Oh, leave me to choose If there be sacrifice. There's Agatha,— I pass her where she piles her pomegranates Each day, and daily as I pass repent I deal not, save for health, with poison-herbs. Her crooked shadow is detestable; A thing the sun must draw reluctantly. Now, she would make A pretty offering for the amorous god, And the fair marble wall She sets her fruit by be no more deformed By the uncomely darkness of her shape. Callirrhoë. Speak not profanely; they are mine, these dead. Machaon. The air hath been unwholesome many weeks. Women, disordered and intoxicate Returning from their revel on the hills, Have filled their homes with fever, and increased A sickness that, without this irritant, Had not exceeded in fatality The plague of the great feast ten years ago. Men were not then half frenzied, and a few, Yielding to counsel, were restored to health. Now all essay to heal is idleness, Though one persuade and argue till one's hoarse, So resolutely they refuse to touch What has not magic in it. I deceive No man, and so they die. Callirrhoë. Oh, surely those Whom the gods love live prosperous and blest. Machaon. Love! The cow, with a pleasant consciousness of offspring, may feed the better her calf by her side. Such complacency my mother feels in my presence. 'Tis the sole definition of love my experience warrants. For my part, I've noted Heaven's best lovers are fortune's most cruel sport. Truly the enigma crumples one's eyebrows. Nay, crease not yours. They're not bristly enough to wrestle with the brain's pugnacious problems. Keep smooth-browed. [Enter Demophile.] Demophile. Oh, my child, A fury rises 'gainst the Mænads. Some By their dishevelled hair are haled about, Trampled and wounded. Machaon [restraining Callirhoë]. Mine shall be the task. I hate these Mænads, and can therefore keep The crowd in check. [To Demophile.] Ægle, the saffron-haired, With my own hands I carried to the pyre. So rest her ghost. Now for the angry crowd. [Exit. Callirrhoë. And is your Ægle dead? Demophile. Nay, never mind. You must not tilt my tears over like this. I carried my grief straight until you spoke. An' do not look such struggles—let the eyes Throw down their silver shields and go to sleep. Under the sycamore I'll settle you, Where none have died, and there are many bees. [Exeunt. Scene VII. The City, Anaitis, Dione, Mænads, Citizens. Anaitis [dancing on a heap of cinders]. Behold the remnants of the feast of death! These little heaps, flame-bitten, in my hand, Once comprehended tall and mighty men Who scorned our god. The heavens make no sound, Their laughter's in events. Thy raillery, My god, these light feet shall commemorate, Shall dance before thy presence in this town Upon this carpet of transformèd men Grey as a wolf-skin. [Shouts. Woman [rushing from the crowd]. She is trampling down My little girl! 1st Cit. Why, then we'll dance on her! Ye gods!—the cinders of a smiling child She tosses up like Ætna! Hark ye, fathers, An' will ye bear the sight? 2nd Cit. We'll act our answer. Down with the jackal laughing on our dead! Anaitis. Evœ! Evœ! 3rd Cit. We'll trample her to death. 1st Cit. Ay, an' we'll force the lock of every joint And strain the hinge of every sinew in This hateful, impious body! Drag her on! To the temple! Here's another. Break her up! [They seize Dione. Enter Machaon. Machaon. They'll kill her! Truly, as you love your lives, I counsel you, good citizens, refrain From this mad conduct. Look to it, my friends. Just leave these crazy Mænads to their cubs; Or if you will, drive them without the town; Let them grow hungry on the hills, and feed On quivering goat's flesh, but don't massacre, Lest each slain Mænad cost a hecatomb Of your best oxen, when Zeus' will is known. 1st Cit. The choice white breed! Methinks it were not ill To wait the oracle. If we should err— Machaon. A little injury done to the gods, If measured by the expiatory vow, Is worth avoiding. [Aside.] See, Dione, through That alley there is safety. [Dione escapes. [To Citizens.] Hence with you. To work; unceasing toil alone can dam This pestilence from pouring on your air Till but to breathe is death. Bestir yourselves. [Exeunt Citizens. [Enter Coresus at a distance.] Ah! the mad priest! A most unsteady gait, The face so lean you'd think those rolling eyes Fed on't, as thriving twins Suck thin the mother; cast of countenance Livid, with sudden flare that purples it! Poor fool! Coresus. Self-pity, prudent accusation! Machaon. I spoke in comment, though soliloquy. Coresus. I care not for your sneer, let it be tossed, A petty fire-brand, to the heap of wrongs On which this plague is fed. Insult again. Machaon. His face is flaming! How combustible Some faces are!—You've wrought a noble work, If it be yours—this art of dyeing skins And giving flesh the odour of stale fish. Coresus. I hate the plague, And you. Machon. More rational, I merely hate The sickness; you my science deprecates A madman, dreaming that the heavens note His anger of chafed passion, when a girl Looks coldly on him. Coresus. 'Tis insuff'rable, The taunt! Speech weeps its impotence to quell Such insult, as a stripling sees his sire Murdered, and simply sobs upon his sword. You dream I drew great Bacchus to suffuse This many-peopled town in agony At baulk'd desire? [Mach. nods.] No; for the thanklessness, The triple-hided hebitude that pain Alone can penetrate. A dog will take The bone you throw to him; a mortal stares In obstinate hostility if one, Longing to swell the number of his joys, From laden hand beseech him to be blest. Teach men to suffer, and the slaves are apt; Give them fresh hope, entreat them to delight They grow as stubbornly insensible, As miser to a beggar's eloquence, Clutching their clownish imbecility As the gods grudged them that. Machaon. Men's hopes, desires Are difficult of transport; you must take The mule's path up the customary pass. Coresus. Cursed be the brain that sees the waking light And keeps by Hecate's besmearèd tombs; Accursed the heart that at dithyrambic rush Of chorus keeps its measured Doric beat; And cursed the palsied who, at cymbal's clash, Forget not age. Machaon. Nay, modesty avers It is not decent for old men to dance. Coresus. Cursed the lame creature, custom, that should go 'Mong men a laughter for its hobbling gait, And sets them all a-hobbling, emulous. Cursed be the piety— Machaon. I counsel you Restrain your votaries, their irony Of mirth is hateful in the midst of woe Such as our Calydon bemoans. I fear You'll find a broken form, the life blood spilt, Against your shrine. Coresus. He will put all to rights. [Callirrhoë passes with a band of mourners. [Exit Coresus suddenly. Machaon. I'm fain to envy these god-beset mortals. Those above may be but indifferent judges of our actions; yet the immense stimulus of spectators! One cannot always pluck a man by the gown to force him listen, and thinking's such a rare gymnastic o' the brain, 'tis pity none note it. What a public we have if our pates are verily unroofed to divinity! And yet mortals take it, the gods know no more than what they tell 'em in their prayers. This praying, how shall we define it, if it be not to take a god by the chin tenderly and detain him with the small gossip of one's wishes, fears, and expectations? There's my mother! Her whole religion is an anthology of Olympic scandal. My contempt of her hath brought me to this cynicism. Pah! I was surely wrapt in the cradle-flame of immortality; then pried my maternal parent, and spoilt all. [Exit. Scene VIII. —Dodona: the sacred grove. Timarete, Nicandra, and Promeneia under three oaks, with their arms lifted. A smoking altar at some distance. Emathion advances to the confines of the grove and kneels. Emathion. I hear a sound as if the branches snored, Hollow and peaceful! What if I should die, Die suddenly? 'Tis possible, for terror Oft kills at once. My heart's a stone That doth depress my side most grievously. [The wind keeps rising. The trees wake up. The air is full of noise. Those ancient women have their hour of grandeur; Their wrinkles now become them. I shall die! This shrieking wind will kill me! All the leaves Stretch out their tongues at me! Why don't they speak? They move them up and down, and make a noise As dumb men do, and struggle hideously. I listen, but there's nothing, nothing, nothing! [A whirlwind. Oh, see! The wind is flaring round the dreadful sisters; They're twisting spirally! Their hair, their hair! The wind is carrying it all away Like whisps of straw! I think their scarfs will strike against my head, They seem to grow so long and come so near; And that I feel would kill me. Heaven help! What myriad tongues wag at me from the trees! Would I could hold them still, or tear them out; But that would want a million hands! O gods! There's something in the wind which is not noise. A voice, a voice! Timarete. Yes! Promeneia. Yes! Nicandra. Yes! Timarete. Vainly the tomb-fires flashed where the lightning-flame was the midwife Rending from Semele's womb the boy Zeus had gotten in godhead: Cephalus' daughter hath scorned the Mænad-cares and Coresus. Promeneia. Therefore Zeus will grant no pause from plague ere the maiden Haughty to Evius' priest shall try the feel of his altars,— Knife through the milkless breast or riving the throat's spouting vessel. [Emathion shrieks and falls senseless. Nicandra. Keen as the famished for bread, a god in his vengeance claims victims. Yet will heaven receive the life laid down for another: Who for Callirrhoë dies, atones her sin of rejection. Timarete. Hear! Promeneia. Hear! Nicandra. Hear! [The wind slowly goes down and they come out of the grove. Promeneia. Where is he? Gone so soon! Timarete. What doth she say? Nicandra. Hi, sister? Timarete. What doth she say? Nicandra. Asks where he is. Timarete. Along the road—good boy! Promeneia. Emathion, Emathion, Emathion! Timarete. Her voice—the very squeaking of a mouse! Nicandra. Could not be heard the other side o' the bush. Promeneia. Emathion, Emathion, Emathion! Timarete. She's got it up now to the shriek of an owl. Nicandra. Give her an echo; he'll not answer her. “Emathion.” Promeneia. He must be far away! I shout so loud. Nicandra [stumbling against Emathion]. Why what is this? The stripling; and stone dead! Timarete. Nicandra, help me down upon my knee. He hath but fainted. I can feel his heart. He'll soon come round, and here's a nurse for him. [Showing Promeneia. My back! Nicandra, help me up! My back! Oh, oh! my back! There—gently, sister!—ho! Come, Promeneia, squat beside your boy, Crook up your squeaking knee-joints till he wake. [To Nicandra.] That lunge you gave me, sister, might a' loosen'd The roots o' my back; it almost feels torn up. I'll thank thee for my stick; it's by the altar. Nicandra. I'll fetch it, stay! [Exit. Timarete. And, Promeneia, hold me up a bit. Promeneia. I will not. I must light the lamp o' this face. Gone out completely. Timarete. Do, and let me fall. [Re-enter Nicandra. Here's my Nicandra, with her harder heart, Hath brought my stick. We'll shake along together Who know that we are old and relative. [To Promeneia.] Paint, dress in wanton robes! The interim of this swoon cries out for use; He'll wake and worship. Thank me, and we'll go. [Exeunt. Promeneia. There's something in it. I have a pot whose red conserve would dye The very tint of nature, and a robe Of richest grain—my mother's—with a hem That shines as if the sun was underneath And edged it, as I've often seen a cloud, And . . . I will do 't! . . . No, no! I will not do it. If he can love, he loves me as I am, A brown old woman, shrivelled till her veins Stand out like those in a mare's side. He's long In coming to himself. I am a fool! [She sits by his head, her arms round her knees and her chin on them. Now I can use him as I will; can gloat Upon him till my eyes are gorged; can take His hair up in my hand, thus, thus! A curl Has caught my finger. He would give to me A golden ring, a ring; and I will have it If my one tooth must go. Nay, I have scissors To cut away this precious bit of him Which loves me. There! And I can kiss him too. Can pluck the kisses from his lips as feathers From strangled birds: and so I will, I will. I'll pull them from his lips, thus—thus, and thus! [Kisses him. He stirs!—Emathion!—and he looks at me! Emathion. Are you my grandmother! Promeneia. Even so. Now he will love me. Emathion. Yet she died, I know. How old am I? She watched me when a child. 'Tis very strange! Where am I? Who are you? Promeneia. Your grandmother, who never really died, But went to keep the oracle of Zeus. Emathion, you are very like your mother; I watch'd you as you slept, and that revealed it! Kiss me! I hope you'll love me. Emathion. I am not like my mother. I am told No son was so unlike! Callirrhoë Is like her! Oh! Callirrhoë—the oracle! There's something weighs upon me—just as if A foot was on my heart. Oh, I remember! You are that damned old woman, and you lie To call yourself my grandmother! I live To bear the anguish of my sister's death. 'Twas you said she must die. Promeneia. 'Twas I that warned you from the oracle; I, even I. You would not listen then, Deaf as an adder. Ah! I see, you think That I'm too old a purse to have within The golden coins o' kindness. Emathion. No help, no help! She'll make a beautiful corpse. But she must die first, and all the pain of it, the bleeding, the struggles; there's what makes me shudder, and I must tell them to do it; and there's no hope, no help! Promeneia. But there is. Emathion. What! Help? Promeneia. Will you kiss me to tell you? Emathion. Kiss you! No!—Yes. Promeneia. Thus further spake the oracle: Yet will heaven receive the life laid down for another; Who for Callirrhoë dies atones her sin of rejection. Emathion. Some one may die for her, die instead of my sister. She has many lovers—and old Cleitophon— and— Promeneia. You— Emathion. Promised . . . I must give it, although I heave. I can't descend her mouth; it's a valley. There! [kisses her] A—ho! Promeneia. He's erased it from his lips like a blot! He's rubbing it off still. Oh, the full, fleshy mouth, it was like a bee coming down a dried-up flower,—the roundness, the softness, the warmth came down my hard crevice, and there was no honey for 't. Emathion. This place hath given me a sickness for life. I'll away. I'm going with my horrible news to catch the plague and die. Oh, I can't go home! Promeneia. Then stay, stay, oh, stay with me! I'll ask for no more kisses again,—never again, I swear. Emathion. Better the plague, for 'tis a short sickness. I must go home, for I should be tracked if I went elsewhere; I should be killed if I stayed here,— and some one will die for her! I'm going. Promeneia. Never! I'll have you seized; you must return. Emathion. I'll return if I die not; on my faith, I'll return, for I mislike you not so much now I discover your great love, which makes the scale of my favour heavy. [Aside.] I'll lie my breath away to escape, for I'll never, never, never return; and I loathe her as the smell of a goat. [Aloud.] I'll but take the oracle to my city, and then return, so the plague pleases. Promeneia. You will? Emathion. I will. Promeneia. I hope You are as true as you are beautiful! Emathion. Trust me! Farewell. Promeneia. Do you affect me enough to— Emathion. Shake your kind and honest hand. Promeneia. To— Emathion. You swore. There's my hand. I'll return. There's flutter in the beeches! And they'll speak. There's a wind rising, and they'll speak, and I could not bear it. They'll say I must die! They're beginning! But I'll not hear! [Rushes off.] Oh, I am leaving hell! [Exit. Promeneia. He's torn my vital parts from out o' me And carried them away. Yet he'll give back My life to me. He said he would return: He said it twice. He also said he liked me— The dun old woman, with my bits o' hair That hang like sheep's wool on a wither'd thorn. He said it! Look, he's on the distant road, A precious bead that rolls down a white thread. He drops, and there's the thread without the jewel! Yet he'll return. He said so! I am mad to think he will. He would not kiss me, would not look at me. He never will return. Then will I go to him, though bowed with age, Bowed almost double as a sail with wind. I'll go to-morrow; nay, to-night; nay, now. My stick, and kindly lifts in car and waggon Will help me on. And here I cannot stay. I'm not an owl or bat that hates the light; I love it, and the light is in his face. [Exit: on the other side re-enter Timarete and Nicandra pointing after her. Timarete. Ha! ha! Nicandra. Hi, hi! Timarete. Ha, ha! Nicandra. Hi, hi! Light crone! Timarete. Sister, she's good to make me cry a bit. There's nothing touches me, and I must laugh To find a use for tears. Upon my jowl There's one that tickles me. Nicandra. It is a flea. I've got it! Ay, for laughter I could sob. Timarete. It's comforting, the moisture, when your eyes Are dry as beetle-cases. Her's are damp, So damp I wonder that there are no frogs Within 'em; yet she thinks that men can love Peer in their dank enclosures. Nicandra. Naughty sister! You'll force me to a crying bout o' mirth. Hi! hi! Timarete. Ha! ha! [Exeunt. Scene IX. —A room in Aglauria's house. Machaon is discovered sitting meditatively with some manuscripts before him. Machaon. 'Tis strange what it costs to make people attend. Now, I can consider this disease with as great intensity as Tantalus his o'er-hanging fruit. To ensure eager scrutiny, you must put an object out o' reach. That's why men are so fond of religion. It ever eludes them, and yet looks graspable. Ay, and there's some natural hunger in the heart too. Thin-stomach'd Tantalus and the bonnie golden gourd splitting open! 'Tis a pathetic sight! But here's the Augean stable to cleanse, and the dung must be carried shoulder-wise. My friends join the exploring party in search of the river Alpheus, to turn into it. I am left to toil by shovelfuls. If men had patience, and would not look away from life, I could make their existence tolerable. [Goes to a cupboard and looks for something, singing.] Have mortals then found that life goes so well With gods to follow? I have cracked the world as a walnut-shell, And found it hollow. They must be bored who never are alone, It can't be pleasing; Yet with one's self for ever to be thrown Is not heart-easing. [Draws out a child's hand for dissection. Oh, I turn to my scalpel as a girl to her spindle! Here's a bit of dissecting to help me recover my temper. What delicate work is this! What fineness of texture. I will keep the secret of it, though. The arts of introspection are not for the crowd, nor the tunesome comment of my throat on its follies. [Sings.] I with the tedious Machaon walk: It does not strike me That we shall have much philosophic talk, He is so like me. Yet they who fondly with the gods debate, In tittle-tattle Are heard, or rather on their pate Hear thunder rattle. [Begins dissecting. A pretty hand! The little Ægle's dead— Hers was more dimpled. How she loved to pat My cheeks! Of late she grew a little shy— For childhood's calyx shrivels when 'tis time For bright-leaved girlhood. Little Ægle's dead! [Knocking. Away my hand and scalpel! [Puts them carefully away; enter Aglauria. Ah, the briony! But you look, for all the world, like a Mænad, mother, with those dangling trails about you. These berries will be serviceable; yet I would not have my gentle mother put in peril of her life when I covet an extract. Since the rage has set in against these flower-filleted lassies, one can scarce crown one's wine- cup unsuspected. Aglauria [laying down the briony]. There, child, for thy fancy! And I know not the peril I would shrink from to please thee; so only thou wilt be wary thyself, and not scuffle in the street for the rescue of these vile foreign women. Does report say true, thou did'st stand by some Mænad, whose flesh the crowd was about to strip off with her ivy? Machaon. Ay. For the case grew semi-surgical. Aglauria. Well, if you're chief physician to that band, Old Cleitophon will trouble you no more With stories of his ague. Machaon. Then he'll die. Aglauria. Thine is unruly babble. Cephalus, If thou had'st talked more softly of the gods, Had doubtless chosen thee his son-in-law. And the girl's dowry— Machaon. Had been recompense More than a hundred Cleitophons for cure Of their particular infirmities Could e'er enrich me with. Oh, I will sigh, “Doubtless we have offended heaven,” when next Blight falls upon the land. There is no trick Like sighing. Mother, in the mimicry I will be perfect. Aglauria. Fie, you cunning boy; 'Twill be Callirrhoë you're sighing for; But if you'd win her, never more be seen Saving of Mænads. Machaon. Mother, do you know It was Dione that I saved from death? Aglauria. You speak as she were mine—a wayward girl Her father could not curb—a restless sprig. And not thy sister. Mark, Machaon, this— If thou befriend the witless thing, the crowd Will turn on thee. Just let them have their way. But do thou keep to the old gods, and soon I'll deck thee a fair bride-bed. Machaon. So—so-ho! Aglauria. I'll get thy supper. Machaon. Let it be a quail; And melons, mother, melons! [Exit Aglauria. Ay, she's fair, the strong, lithe, shapely girl, yet not for me. And I marvel not the women of Lemnos slew fathers, husbands, brothers, and put an end to population till they could furnish their brats with heroic fatherhood. Oh, we fail not in the stuff of motherhood; but the heroes—the heroes! There's Emathion, a beautiful greyhound at the heels of Circumstance. Yet his sister dotes on him. It enrages me. I'll back to my work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. —Citadel of Calydon: Acephalus, Megillus; Machaon on a higher level. Machaon. Truly this is to affect the god. Thus the Olympians, choosing a vauntage-ground above the field, watch men's passions interact. Well, I can do it, and play the god. 'Tis all I can. There's Acephalus, retributive, alert, with tight lips where no breath passes. [Enter Cleitophon.] Here's old Cleitophon! He makes the hill-brow his afternoon stroll—nothing perturbed; for the pious have buzzings from their own bosoms they interpret oracularly, —a small Dodonic grove in the rocky region of their prejudices that knows which way the wind blows. How now, Megillus? Those rosy cheeks belie the rueful visage. Megillus. Why, doctor, I shall be a poor man if the young fruits keep shrivelling. There's a blight in nature; something offends. Could you counsel me? Machaon. You remember that round the temple of Æsclepius some folks are stationed, with brains, to be referred to if the divinity be not curative. Why, man, you are the only mortal, not half-crazed by sorrow, who has had sense to apply to me. Now I'll tell you, the gods hate inhuman parents. Don't tremble so; the destruction of a few figs is light punishment! I advise you be patient—Ah! [starting]—and go help my mother up the hill; the steepness distresses her. [Exit Megillus. Yes, truly, 'mid the dotted dark of yon patch of vine something stirred. Then I lost it in the cypress grove; yet I'll fasten my eye on the near edge of the black trees. If he keep the path he cannot issue un-noted. Meanwhile, I'll divert these watchers and myself by learning their unofficial predictions; if these clash with the oracle, how the fools will be crest-fallen! [Enter Megillus with Aglauria.] Aglauria. I see you climb Daily the hill as I; 'tis well to learn How thinks the oracle before one thinks. Acephalus. You're curious. The plague has harmed you not; but should you care—that son you have so doted on—to leave his clammy corpse, and learn how the winds blew over Dodona's oaks? An' though it felled the Titan branches, could it trouble you? Hard woman, I say Chiron must crowd his boat for the return passage he ever makes in solitude, ere this calamity be repaired. Machaon. Well, if we're all bid straight get drunk and dance, My comely mother, will you lead the step? Aglauria. I shall do what is best. Machaon. Time-serving is the true elastic mean Between devoutness and rank blasphemy. I err in the defect. Old Cleitophon Is piety stone-blind. [To Cleito.] What will you do If faun-skins become ordinary wear In Calydon; will you be singular? Cleitophon. We need no oracle to show our deeds Clear heinousness. We know where lies the guilt— By Artemis' lone altars. [Enter Demophile. Machaon. My good nurse, What brings you to the brow? Demophile. Care of my child. Dear heart! But yester-night a mother brought A dead stark babe and threw it at her feet. Since then she has not cried at all. She sits And spins, and sometimes in an altered voice Sings snatches of her songs. Acephalus. He comes! he comes! All. Where, where? Acephalus. Out o' the cypress-grove, and he brings death. Aglauria. Machaon, he is here! Machaon. Hum! Would you make my knowledge know? Aglauria. Knew you? Machaon. Ay, you begot a prophet. Megillus. We'll make him answer for his sloth. Acephalus. Sharply. Machaon. Now to this people in extreme distress The gods will give some riddle; it diverts The pain of heart-ache to perplex men's heads; I have oft tried it. How divinity Is imitative of my ways, or I At heart oracular of the divine! Aglauria. Oh, see, he comes! Let each man shut his mouth; Now shall we learn where lies the safest way. Acephalus. The safest way! I'll learn where lies the guilt. [Rushes to meet Emathion. Demophile. Oh, now my girl will have her fears relieved! Cleitophon. Now will the Bacchic worship be supprest; The land made clean! Megillus. Haply by sacrifice. Whatever may be asked for we must give. Machaon. Truth, father! thinking little of thy life, If the gods fancy that. Megillus. My life! Let those who have begot this plague Die to allay it, if 'tis so decreed. Machaon. Great zeal for justice! Now I think of it, That very day you beat poor Nephele, The pestilence— Before it was a summer sickness—grew Deadly in force. That I distinctly marked. The gods, discriminative, will adjust— Aglauria. Peace! [Enter Acephalus, dragging Emathion. Good Emathion, why so haggardly Approachest? Speak, for the plague rages still. Acephalus. They are all ashes in the city. Give A victim to our vengeance. Demophile. Speak, she dies, Callirrhoë, if you delay— Emathion. She dies! Gods, ye said truly. Why, what need of me. Oh, is she dying fast? Machaon. How dare you tax A man o'er-heated, unrefreshed? He raves. Give him some drink. Rest on my arm awhile, And then interpret what the doves and oaks In concert with Dodona's breezes spoke. Emathion. What! Have you heard it, the great clashing wind? Machaon. You see, the prophet's vacancy disturbs brain's normal action. [Enter a crowd of Citizens.] 1st Cit. Speak! the oracle. 2nd Cit. Speak, or we'll tear your throat to find the words! 3rd Cit. What is it? What's to do? Machaon. Emathion, make a clean breast of it. Emathion. Oh, the burthen of the oracle! the wind seemed in labour of it, and moaned heavily. 1st Cit. Do you think, man, we care for its mumbling? [They lay hold on Emath. Emathion. She's to die, do you hear? And the oracle—though the wind could not bring it to the birth, —you shall have it—as the women tore the sobs out. Callirrhoë herself, so she find none to die for her, must die for scorn of Evius' priest. It said the knife— It said—through her milkless—Oh, Machaon! Machaon. I'm a favourite with the babies; they're always for my shoulder. You see here's a big one requesting it. You're too old for a ride. What shall I do with you? I'd laugh him into manhood. Demophile. But we will die. I will die gladly, and who would not die? Machaon. Oh, doubtless many will give votes for death, Writing a comrade's name upon the shell, Never their own, for that were insolent Self-choice in privilege. Nurse, not so fast. Think you Emathion will not joyfully Prevent you to preserve Callirrhoë. Emathion. Who—I? Why must it be her very blood. Is there not one who loves her in this town Would succour her? [Silence.] Or if indeed her blood, My uncle Cleitophon, I know your care And scrupulous observance towards the gods. You have been foremost in misguided zeal; And now will doubtlessly desire to bear The chiefest penalty. Machaon (aside). He dug his nails Into my hand as vulture in its corpse. But I'll not be the still prey of his fears. Let him look to't. Cleitophon. Except one die for her! Were not obedience most precise if she Herself should die? Aglauria [looking anxiously at Machaon]. Well said; a substitute Will never satisfy. Thalia asked This onyx ring of me. I prize the hoop, And gave instead chalcedony fair set; But ever on my finger jealously She hath kept watch. Is it not laughable To think the gods would take a shrunken thing As you, or me, or indeed any one But just the dainty creature of their choice? Machaon. Try them, Emathion; you are young and fair. Emathion. She never would consent. You, all of you Refuse? Why, uncle, I ne'er had a doubt You would not by a decade forestall death. Cleitophon. It is a pious maiden! Shall we learn How lies her will before we intervene With fond, precipitate suggestion? 1st Cit. Her will! 'Tis settled she must die for us. She dies! She must! she shall! Machaon. And you speak reason. We must not waver; yet an instant pause. Hold a brief council 'mong yourselves; meanwhile I'll learn the exact conditions, truth's details, From this poor boy. Soon as we clearly know Th'ordained victim, we'll go fetch the priest. Misread a word o' the oracle, we lay Fresh miseries upon us. [Citizens talk apart. [To Emathion.] Look you here! She must not die,— Why, I would die to save her. Save I will, But never pander to a priestly fool. Go, bid her fly by the far entrance, And fly yourself,—there! Change your feet to wings. And, nurse, prepare and have in readiness Old garments fitted to dress up escape. [Exit Demophile. Stare not so aimlessly; address the crowd One moment, ere you flee. Emathion. I cannot tell—I—I will die for her! Machaon. You! till the knife gleams,—but presumably— Come, exercise your rhetoric; the crowd Will tear you if you tender not the word, And promise instant reparation. Offer to die for her! I'll see you safe. Emathion. Good citizens, Behold me here a wretched, doomèd man, You thought to welcome a deliverer; Suppliant I clasp your knees. Most faithfully I served you, not neglecting any rite, And for reward Learn that this city must be purified By blood—my sister's or— Machaon. He'll choke to death. Emathion. My own,— If none whom life abuses takes this means Of ridding him of all its miseries. 1st Cit. We will not listen, we have died enough. Come, we will bind you. Machaon. Softly, gentle friends. Emathion misinterprets in his haste To save his sister. 'Tis the girl must die, If she accept not one to die for her. Most manifestly she will never choose Her only brother; me she would but flaunt As somewhat liberal in my censorship Of certain phases of Olympic life. A victim must be passive as a sheep, Ba-minded, or he'll irritate. You all Are well content Callirrhoë should die. She will be well content. Yet ruffianly To fright and bind her were inhuman. Pause, [To Emath.] Keep from her doors a moment's interim. Prepare your sister. We will keep the brow. [Exit Emath. Scene II. —Callirrhoë's Home. Enter Callirrhoë and Emathion. Callirrhoë. What says the oracle? Emathion. The word is you must die, ere Calydon Be saved—except . . . Callirrhoë. Why pause you? Give me all. Emathion. One die for her. My uncle Cleitophon Refuses, holding precious his grey hair. Callirrhoë. My brother, what said he? Emathion. Callirrhoë, if you would have it so . . . If so . . . but yet . . . 'Twas your peculiar impiety, Slighting Coresus' love, that brought the town To this great pass. . . But if you'd have it so . . . Callirrhoë, have it . . . Callirrhoë. None will die for me? Emathion. Not Cleitophon; the elders were all mute. Callirrhoë. It is not that. You will not die for me. Indeed, I thought The city loved me. Emathion. My dear sister, think. Men love their lives. You know not how it hurts— The spectral crowd and the grim ferryman— Sharp from the burning sunshine and blithe youth. Come to Demophile's. My dearest, fly, and we shall both be saved. Callirrhoë. My city—I will save it! Oh, be soothed Poor mother, bending o'er thy tortured babe;— It will recover. You, Emathion, Say to this people I in ignorance Have wrought them evil, let them flock to see The expiation. Emathion. No, I'll never see Knife near your breast. Callirrhoë. Although you pierced it through, Emathion, when I knew you could not die To save me. Think'st thou I had suffered it, My beautiful, so amorous of the light? What, give my mother's only boy to death! Not so. I was a little grieved you failed, But so you failed at the palæstra once, Itys proved stronger—was it possible? And so I kissed you. Now I add farewell! Emathion. Farewell, farewell! What would you have me do? What do you mean? To leave me raving mad, To wander round the temple? Stay with me, Stay with me, succour, teach me to escape! I shall go mad. I'm like a lighted torch— There's fire upon my head. Deliver me! Callirrhoë. Vex not my few last breaths. Be serious. Demophile will tend you faithfully, Nay, dote on you. Think of Callirrhoë Where she hath been most happy, by the brook; And of my father, raising to his lips My little twy-eared bowl. Emathion. No, not like that;— Lying in bestial death i' the midst of blood. Well, you must love this taste o' the shambles, love it, To choose it. There, they'll drag me. From the hill I hear them shriek Emathion. 'Tis like Actæon with the hounds about his heart! Pull them away! Callirrhoë. Emathion, be calm. Fear not this people; 'tis for me they cry. You, by this secret portal shall escape And take the narrow cliff stairs to the home Of good Demophile, who ever watches Her children's blanching faces. Stay with her Till you see health's bright tincture on their cheeks; That is the sign that Calydon is saved, And all at peace. Emathion. You . . .? Callirrhoë. Think you have left me at the spinning-wheel. [Shuts and bolts the door behind him. And that is true. A few more fateful threads! The scissors blink on me. How very still It is. They're waiting me. My little bed Looks dreary, as they'd newly borne away A corpse from it; ay, and a maiden corpse, No children crowd to kiss. To give one's body, with its great desire For love—the very love it's fashioned for, As firebrand for the flame-tip—to be cut Away from sense, so that unlovingly Men will behold it! Oh, my Hylia! Death caught you sudden in a husband's arms! He hath mistook his place—the rear of love, Never the vanward. Shame on me! They come! [Exit. SCENE III. —A hill-side, Calydon; on the opposite height a troop of Mænads. Enter Coresus. Coresus. These lovely ranks I've marshalled for the god, And the plague-heaps o' the city! Oh, it's vile, That work; it crazes me. All sights are turned To madness; all the deep tenacious loves Drop from my life. Anaitis dead; the faun— And I had sought for him the whole night through— My faun. I found him in a moony nook; So deep his slumber, an arbutus-bell, Fallen on his lid, there lay; a woodmouse curled Asleep upon his breast; the topmost lock On's head hung loose as aspen-leaf to the wind. Save for that little touch Of life's disorder, I had feared, he lay In stillness so deep settled.—Were she hurt, Hurt to the very quick! All's well with her, I'm left with my torn Mænads. I'd not live To be the butt of my malediction, But for the oracle, The oracle, that yet may ruin her. It's a way of tracking guilt down to the seed, And the guilt's her's. My hands are stained with it As the dyer's with the Tyrian—she's the stuff Red to the fibre. (Enter Dione.) What o' the oracle? Dione. Oh, nothing of the oracle? Coresus. Then, indeed, Nothing of note. Dione. The bleating children come Up here. I find them wet-faced i' the cold. Coresus. It's nothing; it's the plague. Dione. No; the flesh was sound, but the face had a sort of cry in it. Methinks it died for its mother. [Enter Messenger.] Messenger. Oh, quick, Coresus, for from the oracle Emathion hath returned, and the word is, Cephalus' daughter must die for the insult done to Evius' priest. They've brought her to the altars. None will die for her. She's waiting. Quick! or she'll not feel it, if you're laggard. Coresus. Will she faint? Messenger. No; her face grows sharp and hard as sculpture. She must bleed. Oh, come to her! The plague will not budge while she's breathing. Coresus. What! No quiver till the knife-thrust? Dionysus, I thank thee for this rare victim. All things to my hand. Yet 'tis possible she escape me. All's marred if one die for her. How said you? Messenger. None will die for her; she, Callirrhoë, stands at the altar steps. Dione. Callirrhoë! It's the girl with the blind father, that sings. Coresus. Sings! Have you heard her of late, have you marked her? Dione. To bring all this death! No marvel they'l not die for her. Coresus. Peace, fool! The plague's mine. I own it. Did you say none would die for her? Deaf, deaf, the whole city full. O Dionysus, thou tormentest as a god! Dione. The people perish. Think! they're innocent. Save them. Coresus. The plague's mine; her blood's mine. I thirst for it. To uncistern her very heart! And to think one must get at it as at a beast's heart!—her heart —Callirrhoë's. See the great knife be sharp. To the altars! [Exeunt. Scene IV. —Demophile's house. A child in a cradle. Enter Demophile with some clothes. Demophile. There they be—ancient hoods and coarse old wraps. This will hang about my girl; and there's a gown will sit on the sturdy doctor to the very life; an' this will muffle up the boy. I've kept the dingiest for the boy; he's so much beauty to hide. May they all prosper! The babe sleeps My babes were all restless; but they rest now. [Knocking.] Who's there? Emathion [without]. Nurse, nurse, nurse! Demophile [opening the door]. All right, it is all right. Everything's ready.—But what haps that you look so wild and ashy? Is it well with her? Emathion. No; ill, ill! Demophile. Would she not fly? Emathion No, no. She wanted to die. It's against nature, but she wanted to die. Demophile. Is she gone? Emathion. Yes, yes! Shut the door! She's no hinges like that! You can't move her. Demophile. 'Tis a brave lass, an' I'm glad my milk went to her making. An' you've left her to die, you wretched, puny brother? Why, she'd have given you her blood like a pelican—the tender white thing she is! When you slapt her in the face and I cuffed you, how she flushed up and coddled you with her cooing “There then.” Yes, hang your head and set your lips a-trembling! I'm glad on 't. An' let me tell you, I never liked you, and to-day I think you're nothing but offal. I've a good mind to throw you out o' doors. Emathion. O nurse, have pity! Let me stay. She will die, and she sent me here. Demophile. There's no time to spare. Be a good boy, a good, loving boy, and come wi' me to die for her. As the kernel's in the hard nut, is happiness in this hard death. If not . . . Will you come? Emathion. I dare not—I cannot; and she sent me here. Demophile. Then stay, and rock the babe—it's all you're good for. If I return not, take it to it's mother. Theron's wife. Mind what I say, and rock it. [Exit. Emathion [dropping on a stool and rocking mechanically]. Oh, I'm unspeakably wretched. And this hateful child knows not, cares not, with its even humming breath and its eyes, like two doves' nests with sleep on them. I can't bear it! I must pinch the child to make it feel a little, feel pain with me. It shall not mock me; it shall be hurt like me, be miserable. [Pinches it.] There! But it does not content. I must out. I must, I must, I must see all! Her blood draws me like a cord to my ankle. They won't note me if I crouch down. And I must go, wretched, wretched Emathion! [Exit stealthily. Scene V. —Without, afterwards within, the Temple. Enter Callirrhoë, Machaon, Megillus, and Citizens. Callirrhoë. My people, I am come to die for you; Curse me no more. To-night in Calydon There shall be health and sleep. 1st Cit. Hurry her on! My children peak and pine, and I must watch My own good flesh I gave 'em drop away Like the patrimony of a prodigal. 2nd Cit. My father's eye was red As embers on the hearth. Oh! let her die Before it is a cinder in his head. Old Man. My arm's hot. Let her die Before my stomach burn, and then my pyre! Soldier. Push on, push on, ye sluggards! Swords and knives! I'd make a quicker business. Sculptor. Ah! superb Her attitude! With thong of her own fingers She's bound her arms back from surrendered breast. I've got a subject that will make me great. Woman. The child is hot and purple as a fig; It is my only child, and I am old. Oh, save it! Callirrhoë I am ready. [Enter Demophile]. 1st Cit. What a face! Sickness and hurry do alternately Pinch and dilate its features. Let her pass. Here, woman, drop beneath my arm, just so! What news? Demophile. None, none . . . Oh, stop! for I am come To die, d'ye hear; to die instead of her. Dear heart! she's never had upon her skin Aught red but sticky bits o' sycamore— That she should have it dabbled with her blood! Machaon. 'Tis the wet nurse! Callirrhoë. It shall not be. Your milk Feeds the weak human grafts, the stranger shoots They put within your bosom. Mine's a fountain Which never hath received within its basin That it was formed to hold. Demophile, You taught me first to walk, and now good nurse, You'll see how nicely I can walk to death. Demophile. Her blood, her blood! [Faints. Callirrhoë. This hand hath often held my clothes for me. It must not hold them now. You do no service, Poor kindly fingers—loose. Machaon. Your eyes are tearful. Callirrhoë. It is giddiness. Machaon. You stooped. Callirrhoë. I'm straight. They crush me? Machaon. Off! stand off! Acephalus. The priest, where is the priest? Callirrhoë. He keeps me waiting! Machaon. Brute! Callirrhoë. Comfort my brother. I used to nurse him when he cried. Machaon, Comfort him; he hath need. Machaon. 'Twere better far Blister the inflammation of his terror Than pacify with lenatives. Nay, nay! I'll do it for your sake, Callirrhoë. Cleitophon. Hail, my dear kinswoman, so glorified of the gods, so honoured in death, so dignified as a patriot, so sanctified as a mortal, so beatified as a maid! [Enter Promeneia among the crowd.] Promeneia. I'm sick and full of pain; a fever runs Beneath my skin that's dried upon my veins Stiff as a bat's wing; and my eyes—they feel To bubble in the burning caldrons O' the sockets. I'm o'er tired; and yet, be brave, Old sinews! I will beat ye on no more When I have seen Emathion. His sister! I thought she'd all the graces o' the world To be his sister. 1st Cit. By my word o' faith, This is a cruel waiting. 2nd Cit. She looks sick. He's never kept a beast so long. [Enter Emathion, creeping behind the crowd. Promeneia. 'Tis he! How like a god he looks! Emathion, I am here. Emathion. Oh, horror, horror! Woman. Why don't her brother die? [To the child. Hush-a-hush! Mother will blow on thy hot little head. Curse the slow priest! [Exit Emath. 1st Cit. Well said, dame. Let's haul up her brother to the altar. We must pull him as an ox, for he will walk not as a man. Promeneia. You want to kill Emathion? Kill me! 'Tis all the same, because of love! 1st Cit. Ho! ho! 2nd Cit. Ha! ha! 3rd Cit. Just listen! An' he wants to live To fondle her!—the beautiful Emathion! Would marble mate with dung? 1st Cit. 'Tis a strange world! 2nd Cit. Well, we must give him up; but we'll not speak with him henceforth—only hoot at him, mock, howl, gibber, jeer, and execrate till his flesh shall be sore with shame, as a bull's hide with gad flies. [To Prom.] Come, you said you'd die. Promeneia. For him. I will not move a step for her.— With agony my gums butt at each other. I cannot stand.—Die you for her. She's nothing. 2nd Cit. Come on! Promeneia. I will not die, I will not die! Oh! oh! [Falls. 2nd Cit. A case of plague! 1st Cit. Away! We're pressed on her. 3rd Cit. Let us be gone. 1st Cit. The priest! He comes at last; He'll stop infection! [Enter Coresus. [Pointing to Callirrhoë] See, her pallor's red As painted ivory of a goddess' cheek. 2nd Cit. But the brown priest is pale. Promeneia. Lonely and dying! Hateful death, to steal This weight of love away from my lock'd heart. Old chests are strong! You shall not; for I'll fight your each essay To turn the key! And, oh, it is a fight Tears me to shreds! Coresus [to Callirrhoë]. And will none die for you? Have you no lover? Callirrhoë. For my people, I Come joyfully to die; each breath I draw Delays deliv'rance; choose where thou wilt strike. Coresus. It is the heart hath sinned. Bare the right breast. [Aside. Oh, lovely, snowy summit to the rock Of her hard heart!—Come near. Behold, ye people, This maiden-victim. Ye have sorely sinned, And so hath she, more deeply than you all. Your sins and hers are blacker than the soles Of a slave's feet, more vile. Then wonder not Heav'n sent this hungry-jawed voracious plague, This tiger of its wrath, to tear your flesh With teeth of maddening pangs. Promeneia. Oh! oh! Coresus. Ye hear the cries That mark its savage feast. Repent! repent! [Emathion glides behind Promeneia, who seizes him by the foot. Promeneia. Emathion, water! My tongue's leather! For you I'd drain the well o' my body. A little water! Emathion. There's for your thirst, and curse you! [Strikes her dead with a blow on the temple. They'll have me; they're after me. I'm the pole to a tent of horror. It's all round me. [Exit running. Callirrhoë [aside]. My brother! Has he repented? Does he comes at last? Gone, gone! Coresus. Impenitence is man's foolhardiness Toward God. Citizens. We do confess the Bromian; Have mercy, Dionysus! Callirrhoë. And forgive. [Coresus turns and looks at her. Coresus. Behold, great god, this people's humbled mind, Forgive, and on their sacrifice be pleased To look with favour. They will worship thee As I have worshipped. They will drink thy wine As I have drunk; will know and prophesy. [Aside.] Oh, I unanchor—I must die—leave her. [Aloud.] Callirrhoë, you are ready? Callirrhoë. Yes. Coresus [raising the knife]. Accept The sacrifice! My god, my god! she's white as holy milk They pour on other altars; thine must have Wine. I am dark, and liker wine than she. I'll keep thy ritual! Behold, I pour! [Stabs himself. 1st Cit. He struck wrong, see!—the priest! 2nd Cit. He struck himself. 3rd Cit. Yes, yes; he'll bleed to death, dry up the stream Of blood; tis from his heart. Callirrhoë. Nay, touch him not, I am his Mænad, I alone believe; Go quickly to your homes; the god accepts The sacrifice. Cry Io for the god! Citizens. Io! Io! Io! Callirrhoë. He heard the cry, Coresus, your great priest. A rapture crossed him. Now he hears no more. I may a little praise him. Calydon, Bear in your heart your high deliverer. Swear ye will live no more to common ends Of food and toil and habit. Swear that here In condemnation of your petty lives There shall be mighty passions solemnized By masque and chorus, that all men may learn The wealth of such emotion as empowers To deed like this. All hail, Coresus, hail! Citizens. We swear. All hail, Coresus, our deliverer! Callirrhoë. Now go home. Go all of you, and see how fare the sick. 1st Cit. Let's see if they are mended. 2nd Cit. Run, run home. 3rd Cit. We'll go. Perchance the sick who died last night, Will presently recover. 1st Cit. Ay, we'll see. 2nd Cit. And do you think my wife will live again? 1st Cit. Who knows! Woman. Oh! the child's cooler. All. Dionysus, hail! [Exeunt. [Machaon goes up and looks at the corpse.] Callirrhoë. No hope to staunch that blood. Machaon, seek Dione, tell her that I come to her In the deep woods. Oh, tell her—break it soft— The Mænads have no priest. [Exit Machaon. Ah me! ah me! How thou did'st ope thine eyes wide at the shout; And I looked down on thee and drank thy love. I am a Mænad; I must have love's wine, Coresus, and you die before my face, Leaving me here to thirst. I dare not mar Thy holy death, mixing my fruitless blood With this most precious, sacrificial stream. Thine be this day's full glory. Oh, my dead, [taking the knife] Thus I despoil thee! [Exit. [Enter Emathion, creeping round the pillars; advances to Promeneia's body.] Emathion. Hath she moved? Oh! she looks but a heap of wrinkled marl! I thought not a corpse was so like soil. I had it in my mind to kiss her; but she's so earthy, she'd crumble into my lips and choke me! I meant but to say, “Be quiet”—no more; but she took it so seriously. She's too brown! But my sister is white. 'Twill be fair to see. [Advances to Coresus' body.] What! Brown too—but smooth as clay? Brown, and it looks not like her. I'm going mad, going mad; for it looks brown and strange. Oh! I'm mad; for my sister looks not like my sister, and I'm her brother and should know; and I say it's not she, which proves me mad. Oh! I am mad, mad, mad! [Re-enter Citizens. 1st Cit. Who's this wolf that smells the dead? 2nd Cit. Stone him off! 'Tis her brother! 3rd Cit. The coward! 1st Cit. Clap him, clap him; he's the hero of the day. Emathion [with a warning movement of his hand]. Plague! Plague! Plague! Plague! Plague! [Exit. 1st Cit. He says “Plague!” Perchance the god hath shut it up in him. 2nd Cit. Well, I'm for Bacchus. 3rd Cit. The knife's gone. 1st Cit. Oh, he's ta'en it. 3rd Cit. He'd best use it! Death would be better than life now, if you'd give him the scales to weigh 'em. 1st Cit. O noble priest! 2nd Cit. O brave deliverer! [Exeunt with the body of Coresus. 3rd Cit. [re-entering]. We'd best burn the old stranger. No fear to touch her now. What's this on her finger? Hair!—a strange ring, i' faith! I know nothing about her. [Exit with the body of Promeneia. Scene VI A Plot of Grass in a Wood. [Faun dancing and singing]. Faun I dance and dance! Another faun, A black one, dances on the lawn. He moves with me, and when I lift My heels, his feet directly shift. I can't out-dance him, though I try; He dances nimbler than I. I toss my head, and so does he; What tricks he dares to play on me! I touch the ivy in my hair; Ivy he has and finger there. The spiteful thing to mock me so! I will outdance him! Ho! ho! ho! Machaon [behind the trees]. A sight to shake the stiffest sides on earth! 'Twould force a misanthorpe to hang a smile Upon his lip, as dew-drop on a thorn. Plutus beholding this would fill with noise Of laughter all the hollow of his voice, So exquisitely laughable it is. 'Tis one of nature's jokes she's mistress of. The little fool Tries to outcaper his own shadow. Ha! With what a pettish energy he springs, His forelock nodding to his sportive heels. Thus man toils oft for the Impossible With earnest foolishness and sorry end. But here's a jocund close to hopeless toil! He's lying all a-grin because he lies Upon his shadow, which he reckons caught. Ha! ha! The very sediments of mirth Are stirred throughout my nature. This gay knave I'll question. [Parting the trees. Faun. Ha! ha! ha! Machaon. What have you caught? Something philosophers themselves can't seize With all their definitions. We'll revere One who has caught himself, and at his feet Sit like small scholars. [Faun offers to run away. Nay, you shall not go. I'll make you talk first. You're a funny thing! Faun. Oh, let me go! I'll bite! Oh, let me go! Machaon. A natural philosopher, I see, Apt with his mouth. I want to hear you talk. For lies you are not keen enough. Methinks The innocence of truth hath never fled This simple mouth, though like a nested bird It soon gets feathers, and betakes itself Even from infant lips. Come, sit you down. Faun. No! no! Machaon. Down with you. Why, you're on the shade That danced with you. He's under you! Sit firm! There's my good knave; you see I mean no harm; And when you've told me all I want to hear, Then dance away within the sun again! Faun. I will not dance. Machaon. No sulks, I'll have no sulks. Come, tell me what you are, whether a boy Or but a boyish creature. Faun. I'm a faun. Machaon. And what is that? Faun. Why, 'tis a faun! Machaon. Just so. But then you're not a boy? Faun. I am a faun. Machaon. His slow conception blocks my questions up. Well, can you tell me how you were begot? Dropt from the womb of Nature, I should say; Or had you once a mother? Faun. I'm a faun. Machaon. A truism, my rustic sage! But how Did you become a faun?—I'll try plain phrase.— Cannot you tell Aught of your childhood,—of the time, I mean, When you were smaller? Faun. Oh, I danced as now, And crushed the acorn-cups, and ran the deer, Sucked the ripe mulberries, tossed the chestnuts up, As I do now, and . . . Machaon. Yes, I understand. —O Eloquence, the tongue of Love, appeal To cherished memories of simple things, And thou art on the silliest of lips That never move to reason!—Then you've lived Your life in woods; or is this very wood Its one green limit? Faun. Once I found the trees Grow few, so few, like hyacinths in June, Which made me very sorry; then, I saw Grass without any shade on which I ran. But then did I grow frightened, for I'm sure The shade cares for me, and will keep me safe. And I ran back. Machaon. Poor little fool! I shrink Thus from a new aspect of life, before Unknown. I cannot run away, like you, To shades of ignorance to hide amaze. Have you got any human qualities? Speak, are you quite inhuman? Faun. I'm a faun. Machaon. —Like all the world, he doth repeat himself, Making an adage stuff the holes of thought. Yet I'm too rough, through grief's ill-timed assault.— You dance and talk, both actions of the man, And yet there's something in you I can't fit Into humanity. I can't tell what. Faun [offering to jump up]. Now I may go! Machaon. Stop! Tell me, can you love? Faun. I love Coresus. Machaon. Ah! and you love him! What do you know of him? Faun. He's kind to me. Machaon. The knowledge of a brute. I hoped for more. What! from this simpleton.—He loved your wood? Faun. He loves it, and he often plays with me, . . . Machaon. How dull are the unfearing to suspect! Faun. And bends the bough of the high fir for reach Of my hand wanting cones, and then he strokes The smooth back of a deer, and binds its neck With ivy-leaves, at which, oh, how I laugh! And then he laughs, and then I clap my hands. Machaon. Hast thou seen any in the woods to-day? Faun. Two, with their noses on a mossy root, That looked at me, and . . . Machaon. I meant any man. Hast thou seen man or maiden in these glades? Faun. No! no! He has not come so long a time. When will he come again? Machaon. No more, no more. —I'd better spell the manuscript of Death To these untutored ears. This ignorance So blessèd in the present may afflict The future, with its wonder unallayed, That growing drearily, at last becomes The brutish misery that never knows. —He's dead. Faun. Does that mean that he's angry with me? Oh, I'll be good, If he will come again, and not be dead! Machaon. —He'll melt my manhood! It is strange most strange; The tongue of knowledge wags with sounding phrase: Set ignorance to question, and it straight Declines to lisping. I am childish-mouthed Before this unschooled creature.—Come to me. You will not? Nay, but I must have you near If I'm to tell you what we mean by dead. —I make too solemn preparations, (Oh, cruel priestcraft of my tender dread!) He's frightened. Brevity but cuts the flesh Of our anxieties; prolixity Tears it. So I'll be brief.— You said that you were sorry when in June The hyacinths drop away? Faun. Yes. Machaon. When they're gone. You cannot get them back again? Faun. I can. Not for a while, but then their streaky buds Shoot up, and soon they're all with me again. Machaon. —Ah! I must give a better rendering From Death's old bone-grey parchment.—Right, you're right! The hyacinths blue the ground spring after spring, Although with different flowers from those you bunched In grasp too small last year. For oft your hands Are greedy with the flowers? Faun. No, for they look Long-faced and tired, and do not smile at me As when they stick straight up out of the ground. Machaon. —A thread to guide me, through the labyrinth Of his simplicity and ignorance, To the mid-chamber, dark and windowless, Where understanding lies!—The tired flowers Grow ugly, lose All likeness to the bells you jerked about So merrily when they were purple? Faun. Yes. When they grow tired, I lay them on the grass; I love to lie upon the grass when tired, And then they go. Machaon. That going I call Death. Faun. But then they come again, quite fresh and gay. But I am tired, tired, tired! Machaon. —The thread is snapt, the labyrinthine way Blocked up with dulness.—Yet you want to know Wherefore Coresus cannot play with you? Faun. Oh yes! Machaon. Then tell me, did you ever love One deer above the rest? Faun. Oh yes! Machaon. —His yawn Is to my heart's pain most medicinal. Tire often blunts the edge of sorrow's sword.— And did it ever cease to follow you? Faun. One day it followed; then lay down; then up It got, and followed as I ran before. At last it lay, and would not stir, for all I tickled its soft skin with chestnut-leaves. It lay, and . . . Machaon. It was dead! Faun [shuddering]. It grew a heap More nasty than an ant-hill, for it smelt! Machaon. He knows the alphabet of Death; my task To make the grim idea creep through the signs As snake through blades of grass. Yes, I must form The sentence of man's doom, and teach to him. Faun. I hate the wood about it; never dance, Or even go there. Machaon. It was dead. Faun. Perhaps It's right again; I never go to see. Machaon. I tell you it was dead. Faun. Then it was dead. Machaon. —How shall I lift the lid of his mind's chest, And empty it of Hope's sweet silver form That's been its tenant and glad prisoner?— Coresus thus is dead: Just like your deer; dead, dead, just like your deer. —He's all a-tremble; yet his frightened thought Still dares a vain resistance, like a girl Who whips the captor's arms. Ah me, ah me! I dare not comfort him while still he doubts; Silence is unbelief's best battle-field.— Faun [in a whisper]. And is he brown and nasty, like the deer? Machaon. —I can't pollute his memory with Yes!— No, no. But he can talk no more, nor move, Nor ever come to play with you again. Faun. He'll come with the next hyacinths? Machaon. No, no! You never, never will be with him more, Or play with him again. Faun. Oh—o—h—h! Machaon. Belief At last fills up the doorway of his doubt.— My boy!—A sob is coming, and the face Looks older now its lines of joy are bent To sorrow's converse will.— [Faun rolls on the grass and sobs. Nay, do not cry. Look, here's a cone. I'll pick you cones, and play. —O Death, how, like a cruel step-mother, You always put your spite in every joy! You've torn a great hole in the happiness Of this quite happy creature, which no stitch Of Time will mend completely. Faun. Dead, dead, dead! Coresus, don't be dead! Machaon. I've got a cone; I'll give it you. There! Try to love me, boy! Faun. Coresus dead! Oh, oh! Dead like the deer. The horrid deer that lay and smelt! Oh, oh! Coresus, dead like that? Machaon. You'll love me? Faun. No. Perhaps the deer's all right! I'll see! I'll see! For then Coresus will be all right too! [Exit. Machaon. Go, have thy foolish way. Thy tears are dry; I will not raise their flood-gate for the world. Deception is the ivy of the mind: I've cut Its roots at his small brain, and it may hang Greenly about it for a little while Before it withers. I must budge, must hence. Poor youngster! Here's the very place his back Made in the moss. Would he could lie and laugh The shadow o' Death uncaught! So Truth can curse: I thought not it could put its sacred tongue To such a use. Heigh-ho! From this time forth He'll have a different laugh. I must be gone! [Exit. Scene VII. —The Market Place in Calydon. Megillus and Acephalus meeting. Megillus. Good-day, these better times. Acephalus. Better times do you call them?—when the pyre-flames have threshed out our hopes, and left us but a chaff of cinders, whence the grain is gone to fatten Death. Better times, you say? Megillus. Beshrew they are! We've apples, till the apple-trees look as if they were the work of Dædalus, that cunning worker in bronze! Pears! Why they are worthy to be ear-drops unto Cybele; and so numerous are they, she might change her ornaments a second. Many fruits, and few mouths. I would not wish to live in better times. Acephalus. You might have borne no fruit yourself, in that you decline so to pears and apples. Megillus. Forsooth, neighbour, the honey of prosperity will soon correct thy sourness. Look you! The town is clean. Yester-night the fiery teeth of Death consumed, save one, their latest corpse. In youth I never snuffed the air with keener enjoyment, nor knew it of so sweet a quality. Thanks to the great god, whose devout worshipper will I ever be! Acephalus. And yet, Megillus, I'm an unbarbed arrow, with no children to carry me into the future. Megillus. Pooh, man! To drive you through a body, and make you the parent of murder, rather than direct you to the bull's eye of your expectations. Our children sow not in our hopes; rather they take the spade and dig them up. Acephalus. They may turn them o'er first; but in the end they fail not to throw the seed by twos or hundreds. I hold not with you; but you only had a girl! Megillus. Leave we this. To-night they burn the priest who killed himself to 'scape killing a comely woman. Acephalus. He did it in a fit. Megillus. A most likely condition for so mad a deed. Acephalus. Let us move on. Here comes a crowd. [Enter Emathion followed by citizens.] Megillus. On my faith, this is Emathion. I'll have a word with him.—How do you, Runaway? Emathion. I shall roll, and tear up the ground; and I shall become all over like yellow clay. But don't mistake. I haven't got the plague! Pray you, do not go away from me, for no one's at home. I can't think where all are gone. Oh no, I haven't got the plague! You're running away! Acephalus. Nay, only you do that. Emathion [pointing at a woman]. She's there! Plague take her. Look! Did you ever see such a flat mouth! Was it made to swallow water, like a fish's? And she's trying to puff it forward for a kiss. Heaven help me! Woman. Why should the young man insult me? I swear I'm not for kissing him, as he impudently asserts. Emathion. I only struck as you might pat a horse— so, so, so! She's there! Water, water, water! Mark her! She's the locust o' my flower of life. So I pinched her—very gently;—so! And I got the plague; and they're all running after. What an eye she's got! When 'twas on the ground 'twas a glow-worm. You think me mad, but I know it's she. There's her one tooth, like a yellow stalactite hanging from the cave o' the face! 1st Citizen. He's lunatic. Young fellow, you need not mow at him; he's senseless to your faces, and methinks it's blasphemous. 2nd Citizen. Just look how he stares at yon olive-tree! It might be a grey ghost from his desperate countenance. Emathion. Listen there! Hark! It's in the trees! They're moving! See! and they say she must die! Hark! It's quite clear now. Oh, the cursèd trees! And they will cut her throat. Oh, no, no, no, no! They'll cut mine! They've got hold on me. Good people, I've the plague! Megillus. He raves of the oracle I should say. Emathion. It's all about my ears; it's in the trees; it says that she must die. Again! But I'll not hear it! Yet the wind's everywhere! and they want to make me die! 1st Citizen. They drove him from the palæstra with hoots and mouthings. He cried as if he were a child again, till the breeze got up; and then he fell into a frenzy such as you behold. Emathion. I'll fly to the Libyan desert, for there are no trees! To the desert! To the desert, before I've got the plague! I hope the people won't run after me— the wind would flap their clothes! To the desert! To the desert, where there are no trees! [Emathion and citizens exeunt. Acephalus. Where are his kin, that he wanders thus at large? Megillus. They say his eyes like sullen comets shoot menace at Cleitophon, and the old man hides from their malignity. Of his sister naught is known. She was not found at home, and the doctor Machaon is missed. Whoever would sail safely over this mystery, let him plumb it first. The young man was comely. But his beauty is the mere skull of itself; and I'll swear I saw grey hairs on his uncombed head. Acephalus. Beauty is a stuff the moths of ill soon fray. They eat it ravenously, and leave it shameful rags. Why, my boy lay on the bed with the tatters of beauty hanging all about his face; his mother screamed at him. And he did not deserve it as doth this madman. Oh, misery lays its eggs in loveliness. Itself eats, and bequeaths the remainder to its progeny—waste and decay, and wrinkles, and grey hair. Faith, Megillus, they be mighty big waves that capsize the mind; for billows have gone over mine, and yet it is afloat. Megillus. The boat sinks sooner than the vessel. There is the danger of these small minds; over they tilt on a sudden. But ours are better built than such small craft. Acephalus. Thine is a tough piece of shipwright's work. A sea of affliction would not affect its sailing. I'll home. Good-day, these better times. Munch your apples, and look at your daughter's urn. 'Twill give you an appetite. [Exit. Megillus. That man's gall is spilt all over his body. The day's still early, and the air is sweet as the breath of Europa's bull. I'll walk on with its fresh companionship. [Exit. Scene VIII. —A Wood. Enter Callirrhoë, hiding some thing in her robe. Callirrhoë. Alone at last; deep in the shady hills, The dark heights I have yearned for. Far below A pyre is burning. Leap, ye glowing flames, Leap up to me! Coresus, it avails Nothing to heap thee with my proffered love. Do we lay food and wine about the dead, When the stiff lips are barred, to make amends For past refusal to the trembling mouth? Had I done evil deeds, I might atone; The gods are gracious, and make clean from guilt. But simply to have lived my summer through And borne no roses! Nothing compensates For dearth, for failure, when the season's past. Ah me, ah me! and he besought my love As wildly, passionately, as the dead Beseech their burial. My heart aches with tears. What do I see? Far down that alley'd green Glimmers the statue of a human form; Immovable it sits. The aspect is Machaon's; yet I scarce Dare give him speech, so inaccessible He looks; aloof in spirit, like a god Hardened against his suppliants Machaon (to himself). The plague Had spent itself; I clearly marked its course, Tracked and predicted the returning health, Dependent on no priestly sacrifice. And yet what glory rested on the girl Who could put life by for her people's peace. And when he lay—Coresus—at her feet:— I have watched many death-beds, seen where Death Was the chief ministrant about the face, Washing, and laying out the spirit's corse;— With him it was quite otherwise; life there Laid death to rest. It was rare dying, that! Life uppermost at end of the hard strife; Death forced to terms in the ensuing peace Involving full subjection. I have brought Word to Dione of that death. Poor child, I think she loved him; when I said he died To save Callirrhoë, she grew as white As the white sheep-skin of her nebris-fringe, And cried, “She was not worthy of his love; She never loved him!” Callirrhoë. False, false; oh! she lied And bore true witness to me all in one. I never loved him, never. Confession is the bitterest penalty When wrongèd Love is plaintiff. I confess; With this addition, that I love him now With woman's rapture, when the man she loves Is god for adoration. I am come Humbly to supplicate I may receive Initiation in the Bacchic rites, And die his Mænad. Machaon. It would please him best You should declare allegiance to the god, And make all Calydon subservient To the strange worship. Men acclimatize To new emotion rapidly; it takes Time to develop custom. Clear the truth By uproar of the Asiatic band Concealed, and overclamoured. Callirrhoë. You discern There is a truth? Machaon. Rather a mystery I would unravel. I have looked abroad, And learnt to use life deftly as a tool Keen-edged to execute my purposes. I had no pleasure; I just won my ends, Toiled and was served; there was no music born. Whereas these Mænads, eager as hot Pan, Catch up all life as the peculiar reed To make sweet passage for their spirit's breath; And Nature leaves her shyness, shows her mind, This sullen Nature, laughing in my face, Like an idiot, his imbecility Made resonant By shrieking echo from the void within. Deep in the forest here, I found a faun Coresus loved; I captured him, and tried To tame his wildness; he would none of me, Was stubborn, restive; when I made him feel His master could not come to him again, The creature blanched and shivered, and fled scared, As though the news were mortal. Callirrhoë. Can it be! A little, wizen body lies along Yon root o' hazel; and a powdery heap Of bones is close about; the hand still grips A horny cone that purple-patches it. Machaon. Oh, bring me there! He went to the dead deer. [They come to the hazel.] 'Tis he; and Death is spread all over him, Death that looks startled at itself, as if It had mis-settled, falling on a prey Unnatural to its appetite. Ah me! How brutal, coarse, and ignorant I stand Beside this sweet stray in humanity; A thing so passionately gay, it seemed The fresh, warm juice that fills the hyacinth, And pulses sudden verdure through the pines, Leapt in his veins; the laughter of the spring Flowed through him; Nature's vehemence and Youth's Met in his rapture. Now I see him wear Death's hoary aspect, shrunken and defaced, The youth o' the world is gone. Callirrhoë. You say he loved Coresus. I have never looked on one Who loved him, and I never loved him—Oh! Dione, you shall yet efface that word! Machaon. Here is another sacrifice. For me, I taught this boy mortality, an art Of which he was most innocent. Callirrhoë. Machaon, it is natural to die Wherever love is; and Coresus gave To this poor faun the faculty of love That stirs the mortal craving. Be content! Machaon. Coresus killed him! Callirrhoë. If you'd have it so. Machaon. Better a plagueful of the city dead Than this strange life miscarried; 'tis as if A part of Nature were herself extinct Coresus cursed all Calydon; here, here, Machaon, is thy work! Callirrhoë. Most surely here, Where Love hath made the great discovery Of Death, a grey coast she must civilize. Machaon. Oh, never, never can man carry there The Hestian flames; ne'er in the mother-shores Of our humanity include that realm. Callirrhoë. Who dwell but with themselves grow impotent; They have no Past; the Past is what hath been Other than now; the Future is a guest Comes not to them Who will admit no novel influence. Such can but iterate themselves. It needs Heaven to transmute our days to yesterdays, And touch our morrows with the mystery Of hope; when men remembered and desired, Straightway they worshippèd. Machaon, be The priest of Dionysus. Machaon. You forget; They would reject me, mindful of my scoffs. Callirrhoë. I know a way to win obedience. Go quickly; gather the great scattered band. I will await you; but the oath is sworn. Machaon. I would not leave that little corpse, except To learn the secret how he came to die. I am Machaon, and still curious. [Exit. Callirrhoë. Dead of Coresus' love, poor little one; Dead, dead for him? And he but stroked thy head, And showed thee kindness; while for me, oh, see! I bring this from him. [Stabs herself with the sacrificial knife. We will both be dead, Dead with Coresus! [Dies. [Re-enter Machaon with Dione.] Machaon. Dione, come to her; look not so hard. She was the stillest girl in Calydon, Shy, and a little proud; be pitiful. [Discovering Callirrhoë's body. Fool that I was to leave her to herself, And not divine she bound me to that oath, To steal to her Coresus! Oh, my boy, Thou dost not lie so orphanlike; 'tis well. Mænads (within). Swiftly, ye Mænads, come to see this girl Who brought the curse on Calydon; leap down The rocks, encompass her! 1st Mænad. Yonder's his pyre! That mounting flame! She lit it; murder her! Machaon. Shriek on; the quiet of the dead is safe As a babe's innocence. 2nd Mænad. She is our prey. Machaon. A heap of leaves will shroud Safe from espial any woodland thing. [Covers faun. Fair vot'ries of the civilizing god, What delicate urbanity ye need! Dione! Dione. He was our deliverer. See, there! From that high ridge above the pyre, A flitting form—no bat's wing!—there again A Mænad tightens round her neck the coils Of a live serpent, pressing in the fangs Fiercely her finger-tips;—these will not live Without Coresus. Machaon. Bare her corpse and speak. For me, I'll watch them till the fever falls— I have great patience with delirium. [Hides. [Enter Mænads.] Dione. This is a Mænad, see! 1st Mænad. Her hair is tressed. This face hath known no workings of the god; It is an unsacked city. Ye are fools, Duped by a stolen nebris. Dione. She came here To join our company; she would not die Till she had owned the Bromian, and bound One who was witness of the sacrifice, A mighty novice, to proclaim the king. 2nd Mænad. Where is he? Where? All men have mocked at us. We have come back half-murdered from the town, Coresus hath forsaken us; he thought No more of the barbarian women when The Greek's white bosom glistened Woe to us! Far are our homes across the sea, our priest Is slain. Woe, woe! Our god delivers not. Machaon [advancing]. Most mightily he succours. Shame on ye, Doubting your great divinity, the while Cursed Calydon breathes the young spring-tide air. I saw Coresus die; your great priest fell, As Semele sank glowing with the god; Life flooded him; he was immersed in life. The power That draws the white milk bubbling to your mouths From the hard scaurs, brake out munificent From kindled lips: this girl stayed not to weep, Stooped not to kiss her lover; she stood up Pleading, inspired, prophetic, eloquent, Inciting the great multitude to praise The city's saviour and Coresus dead. 1st Mænad. She is a Mænad; she is one of us! Machaon. She would not slay herself where the great life Had been laid down, though passionate to die. She came here to the woods, and finding me, Bound me to be your leader. Solemnly I swore to bear true witness to the deeds I had beheld. Believe me, I have looked, Looked deep into your secret things, and own The rustic deity who pressed the grape A god that makes humanity august, Fulfilling it with mystery and joy. Mænad. We take you, we accept you as our priest. Dione. The holy ritual . . . Machaon. Shall be observed. If man need god as his ideal self, He needs the picture of his life sublimed; And we will put Before men's eyes the picture of high deeds, Their hearts will emulate. They shall see acts Like hers, who poured her unpolluted life A frank libation; shall again behold Coresus, with the sacrificial knife, And how he sheathed it. We will praise the god By sculpture of the deeds he hath inspired; Yet not in fixity, for you shall track Each passion from its quick'ning to its pyre;— Desires that momently disclose themselves, In chasmic shock, as the Symplegades Rift to the Euxine, must be held apart, As by Athene's cleaving arms, access Forced to the inmost heart. In you I see Human emotion, action in the rough; Your agitated gestures shall become Rhythmic in tidal refluence, your hoarse shrieks Sonorous intonations. Ye shall dance And thunder in your mighty mountain hymns, While I recount The Evian conflicts, victories, and ye, With glorious inroad of irruptive praise, In chorus shall conclude the chronicle. Do ye accept the doom, ye Bacchanals? Mænads. Take us, your garland-bearing company, Adown the heights; their echoes shall resound With flute and timbrel, and triumphant shout. Machaon. Soon as the sunrise vexes your closed eyes, Spring from your coverts; rouse the sisterhood, And, parting into ordered ranks your band, Assemble here, that we, in solemn train, May bear this maiden down the wooded steeps Of Calydon for burial. Dione. The faun? Machaon. Hush, hush! I'll bury him at day-break in the wood While the dew keeps all quiet. Now, begone. [Exeunt Dione and Mænads. The white troops through the moonlight steal away; The last pale nebris glimmers on the hills. Now can I bare myself To the white skin o' my spirit unto thee, Great Evius!—finding not the wherewithal To worship by the altar, but in life. As I am Bacchanal, I will relax No effort till mankind be broken in By discipline of pleasure to true want In commerce and in dream.—There is a stir I' the heap of leaves. A few more silver hours, And I must put them both away from me;— Callirrhoë Must go to her Coresus; and the boy— I'll lay him in the sunny grass-plot, where No other faun shall vex him with its dance.</field>
