      <field name="fulltext">THE SACRIFICE. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honorable CHARLES EARL of Dorset and Middlesex, &amp;c. Lord Lieutenant of the County of Sussex. My Lord, Having long since devoted my self to a Country Life, and wanting Patience to attend the leisure of the Stage, I have adventur'd to expose this Tragedy, without Action; but I shall never be much ashamed of it, since it has had the Honor of your Lordships Approbation, whose admirable Genius in Poetry, has long since given you a just Title to preside over all Causes of that kind, and whose Judgement never Errs, but when 'tis seduc'd by your Extraordinary Candor. Yet to have a share in your Lordship's Mercy, rather than all the Clamorous Applauses of the Vulgar, shall ever be esteemed a greater Honor to, My Lord, Your Lordships most Obliged and Humble Servant, FRANCIS FANE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE AUTHOR. When o'r the World the mild Augustus reign'd, Wit's Empire too the Roman Poets gain'd: So when the first auspicious James possest Our Brittish World, and in Possessing blest; Our Poets wore the Lawrels of the Age, While Shakespear, Fletcher, Johnson Crown'd the Stage. And tho our CÅsars since have rais'd the State, Our Poetry sustains the Roman Fate. In less Essays successful we have been, But lost the Nobler Province of the Scene: Perverters, not Reformers of the Stage, Deprav'd to Farce, or more fantastick Rage. How therefore shall we Celebrate thy Name, Whose Genius has so well retriev'd our Fame? Whose happy Muse such Wonders can impart, And temper Shakespear's Flame with Johnson's Art. Whose Characters set just Examples forth; Mix Humane Frailties with Heroick Worth: Shunning th'Extreams in Modern Heroes seen, Than God's more perfect, or more frail than Men. With Reason, Nature, Truth our Minds you treat, And shew a Prince irregularly Great. A generous Soul storm'd by impetuous Love, Which yet from Virtue's Centre scorns to move. Thus while the Hero does himself defeat, Your Tamerlane is rendred truly GREAT, When by his Troops whole Empires were o'rthrown, 'Twas Fortune's Work, this Conquest was his own. Your Monarch rages in Othello's Strein, Iago in Ragalzan lives again. Not Hecuba like your Despina Rag'd, Like Her, for Empire and a Monarchs Fate engag'd: With Iphigene your Fair Irene vies, And falls a more lamented Sacrifice. Your Stile, tho just, subservient to the Thought; So Milton, by Aonian Muses taught, His Numbers in Majestic Plainness wrought. Methinks I see the Pyrat-Wits of France Already to this Noble Prize advance: An Artifice in which they most excel, But still, the Sense they steal, they Husband well: Thus Sir, they'll melt your Oar, tho not Refine; While each rich Thought of yours, each massey Line, Drawn to French Wire shall through whole Volumes shine. Accept our Thanks, tho you decline the Stage, That yet you condescend the Press t'engage: For while we thus possess the precious Store, Our Benefit's the same, your Glory more; Thus, for a Theatre the World you find, And your Applauding Audience, All Mankind. N. TATE.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Pavilion, with the prospect of a besieg'd Fort. Enter Tamerlane, Ragalzan, Axalla. Tam. Has Europe, Afric, Asia felt the Charms Of my Victorious, but Indulgent Arms, And shall a soft Chinese Prince still dare Not to seek out his Glory by despair, Shake off those gracious Fetters, which were sent By me, from Heav'n, to be his Ornament, Which his great King puts on, and wears with pride? Rag. At unknown Virtues Salvages are frighted. Tam. The Conquerors of Persia, Macedon, The Lords of CÅsars reverence my Throne; Clear from the rising, to the setting Sun: What Alexander ne'r cou'd reach, I won: Had he subdu'd to the Chinensian Shore, Then with some reason he had wept for more; But, like a froward Child, at Meals too great, He cry'd for want of Stomach, not of Meat. Rag. Sir, from Japan, to the Atlantic Main, The World lies fetter'd in your glorious Chain: Whose Light and Influence in the Heav'ns is felt, As upon Earth the spangled Milky Belt. Tam. Soft, good Ragalzan; we are mortal too: Heav'n cuts out work, which I alone can do. Axal. I'm glad the Emperor swallows not the Pill: Who offers too much Good, contrives some Ill. [aside. Tam. Had CÅsar liv'd, I had taught that Rebel-Peace; And lash'd the stragling Demy-God to Greece, Whose bus'ness was t'enslave, but not Reform; I've cleans'd the World, and brush'd it like a Storm. To purge the World from Sots, and simp'ring Knaves, To chain Vile Monarchs, and Crown worthy Slaves, Is my great Task on the reversed Earth. Axal. Thanks to your Great, but Heav'n-befriended Birth. Tam. Right, brave Axalla. Think not that I swell, Or have out-grown the Robes Heav'n dress'd me in: If I in terms so high my Conquests raise, It is not mine, but my Inspirer's praise. Enter a Chancellor with a Seal, takes his Seat; then a Master of Ceremonies, ushering in Embassadors with Presents. Mr. Cer. The Grecian Emperor kisses your Foot-stool. Chan. The mighty Tamerlane accepts his Offering. Mr. Cer. The Persian Emperor, &amp;c. Chan. The mighty, &amp;c. Mr. Cer. The Emperor of China, &amp;c. Chan. The mighty, &amp;c. Mr. Cer. The Russian Emperor, &amp;c. Chan. The mighty, &amp;c. Mr. Cer. Two and Twenty African Kings beg admission. 22 Kings appear. Tam. Let the Kings wait till the Afternoon. Where's the Memorial? Read it on, Axalla. Ax. Daramnes, Tigranel, and Crantor. Tam. My Father's old Captains. Let 'em have considerable Pensions, besides Pay; and the first Commands that fall. Ax. Isfendiar, Tachretin, and Germean Ogli. Tam. Rich Noblemen: Let 'em be employ'd in places of Honor and Magnificence, they may support themselves. Ax. Haly Mordecai. Tam. Ha! A man that opposes me; not for the publick good, but to be taken off by preferment: let him be advanc'd to the Gallows. Ax. Burranes and Garrulan. Tam. Men of more Sail than Ballast; Impudent, shallow Intruders: Let 'em be banish'd the Court. Princes, for the most part, keep the worst Company. Ax. Close waiting argues no sufficiency, but rather still For want of other merits, they pay you with Offensive diligence. Tam. Right, Fools are fittest for Dumb-shows: While wiser men grow faint to feed on Glances. Ax. Arcanes, Cardamel, and Rozarno. Tam. Persons of great Wit, Honor, and Integrity: Let 'em be advanc'd immediately; there can be no places too good for 'em. I love not to force Grounds; but sow my Favors In fertil Soils, and my returns ne'r fail me: 'Tis pity Virtue shou'd want stuff to work on, Or languish with Ignoble Aliments. Ax. Comets at first are but Terrestrial Vapors: But, when prefer'd into the upper Region, They shine out bright, and there turn glorious Wonders, Because they 're of a pure and fiery substance: While the dull Clouds ungratefully obscure The Sun that rais'd 'em. Tam. Are there no more men that I can do good to? Ax. The Prince of Tanais. Tam. Let him Command o're all, next to thy self: A man of great Conduct, Courage, and Clemency. Give me the man that's made up like a CÅsar, And he shall be one; but no Tamerlane. The Scene opens to Bajazet's Cage: Tamerlane goes to him. Why will you still afflict me, Sir, to see Your malice frustrate all my Clemency? Like a soft Ball against a stony ground, My benefits back to my self rebound. Heav'n knows, your Brother's Blood, your Subjects Tears, Call'd loud for Vengeance to my tender Ears: Heav'n turn'd the Scales; and order'd for your share That punishment you did for me prepare. Reign with more Justice, and resume your Throne. Baj. Now, others Scorn; then I shou'd be my own, Shou'd I, proud wand'ring Tartar, take from Thee One Inch of Ground, one Thought of Liberty: Cou'd I be ground to Atoms, and each grain Might have a Soul made up to dye again; Thy Terrors shou'd not make me own thy Laws, Nor owe Contentment to so vile a Cause. I live for my own sake, and thee Defie: When I think fit, I'll cheat thy Pride, and Dye. (Stamps.) Tam. 'Tis strange, he should not seek to ease his Fate! He cannot bear, and yet desires the weight. Enter Irene. Here, my Axalla, take my fair Irene: Now pay thy self for all thy services, Out of this Treasury of Excellence. 'Tis a reward assign'd thee from above, For firm Allegiance, and Seraphic Love. Ax. Shou'd bounteous Heav'n such Presents often make, It wou'd more largely give, than Man cou'd take: Nor cou'd my Earthy Soul bear such delight, But that, like Heav'n, you rais'd it to that Height. Iren. Just Heav'ns forbid, that I shou'd leave so soon The serene pleasures of a Virgin life, For all the Joys of that unknown Condition. Tam. I know, dear Saint, Axalla does instill The Christian Faith, which mortifies the Will, And sets the Mind above all Earthly care; But, 'tis not fit the World shou'd want an Heir. Iren, Nor is it fit, we shou'd devote our selves To those, by vulgar Error, Nuptial Joys, Till all the World lies prostrate at your Feet, And spurns no more at your illustrious Yoke. Tam. The World is car'd for; but Axalla dyes, My sweet Irene: Wou'dst thou have me lose My worthiest General, for want of such An easie Medicine? These doubts, Axalla, In private must be clear'd by you, or none: Reasons for Love, are best when Love's alone. [Exeunt. Rag. Solus. 'Tis as I thought: She's lost: 'Twas well divin'd, And to the Foe the Letter not ill sent. Zeylan will sound a point of War, to grace The worthy Nuptials of this well-pair'd Hero. What Soul can bear such upheap'd loads of Scorn? Gods, lend me patience for some drowsie minutes, By your revengeful selves, I'll send the Drug back With full career, lest your vext Powers shou'd want it, And from my Fingers snatch the long'd-for Prey. My Love rejected, and my Service slighted, And the great Heiress of the World bestow'd Upon an Infidel, a fugitive Italian; Because, forsooth, he can tell Stories of one CÅsar, A Servant to the petty State of Rome! Indeed, this CÅsar was a pretty Fellow To make a Bridge of Boats, or pick a hole In an old mouldring Wall, and sling the Stones On the besieg'd: to give him 's due, he might Have made a pretty Scout for our Tartarian Army. But shall such puny Lessons give directions To him that leads Twelve hundred Thousand men, And has destroy'd a Hundred nobler Towns Than babbling Rome, in the Celestial China, While I conducted his Victorious Troops? And is this my Reward? The great Destroyer Therefore will I destroy, and in his Ruine Revenge the Conquer'd World, and therein found my Fame; If not the best, yet in the loudest Name. Ex. The Scene the inner part of a Fort. Zeylan, attended with Officers. Zey. Are the Men all drawn up? Cap. Ready to March, And pressing to engage; as eager Lovers After long delays, or Hypocrites After a formal Fast, that whets more than Subdues, urging to pay with sinful Int'rest The mortify'd Receiver of Life's Rents. Zey. 'Tis well. But let me read this once again. Enter Philarmia. The mighty Tamerlane lyes at your mercy. Nothing is weaker than secure Greatness. On the South side of his Camp you may break in, up to his own Pavilion. Make use of this sudden opportunity, by the advice of Your unknown Friend. Phil. What Stratagem, what wonderful Device, My worthy, frowning, speechless General, That I am not thought worthy to partake of? Are Women then presum'd to keep no secrets, Because they never yet confess'd the Truth, And, with a thousand little Arts, conceal, The Friend of Nature, Love, from silly searching Man With an Heroic impudent Modesty? Can they be secret still to curb their Pleasures, And cannot hold their Tongues to save their Lives? Come, Sir, you have receiv'd a Letter from the Enemy: I see your Men prepar'd; I'll sally with you. Zey. Go, dearest, go, and leave me to my Fate; The Sword has no Commission to destroy Thy sacred Sex, but feeds on courser fare: Dangers and bus'ness were cut out for Men; Women are spar'd, to stock the world agen. Phil. Shall I out-live thee then? or can I do it? Are not our Threds so closely spun together, The same hand breaks 'em? Dost thou love thy Fame And envy mine? Are Women only made To stock the Dunghill Earth; pull high-born Souls From native Seats and give 'em Fleshly Dungeons? No, no: thou may'st as easily divorce The loving Elements from each others sides, As me from thine. Go bid the churlish Earth Shake off the Amorous, Sea, that clings so close About her flinty Brest: Go bid the Female Air, That is incorporate with Litigious Fire, Withdraw her temp'rate alimental Aid In his Victorious unresisted marches. Zey. But, my Philarmia, shou'd some boistrous hand Pluck up this lovely Flower, where dwells all sweetness, Beauty in abstract, Light original; Shou'd some rough Mortals, with their Impious arms, Deface this well-drawn Image of Divinity, To which all others are but Counterfeits; Or with rude Weapons force the Ivory doors Of this thy sacred Temple, to let out The fair Inhabitant, thy precious Soul, With her bright Handmaids, Beauty, Wit, and Virtue: The Sun, that borrows Beams of thee, wou'd lose Its Light and Influence, and the World go blindfold, Nature wou'd sicken, the Creation dye. Alas! thou canst not ward a fatal blow, Nor force thy way through woods of walking Steel: Why wilt thou wound me, through thy feeble sides? Phil. Oh, but you are too bold! I can foresee Those dangers, through the perspective of Fear, Which blinding Valor, like a hot Catarrh, Deprives your sight of: Honor betrays you To perilous steps, which Womens cold Complexion And frightful apprehensions are aware of. But if, inspight of all my watchful cares, You are involv'd amidst your desperate Foes; I'll interpose, like Clouds before the Sun, And steal thee from 'em. If I drop to Earth, Dissolv'd in Tears &amp; Blood; 'twas but a useless vapor: If I am lost; a Fond, but worthless Female: No Fate to me can too untimely come; Who may be kill'd abroad, must dye at home. (Weeps.) Zey. Oh, stop those Tears, lest thou unman me too, Till I'm expos'd to hissing Contumelies Of Maids and Matrons, and abhor'd by thee That caus'd my Shame. Alas! thy Honor lies In seeking safety, more than ours in Danger: Nor can the greatest Acts, Atchiev'd by thy Unnatural Valor, wipe off half the Stains That rude Mankind will cast on thy white Innocence For herding with 'em. Phil. Why art thou then so good, so gently kind? Thy Soul's not made up of such course materials. If thou refuse me, I'll to th'other side: I'll kill all those that offer to kill thee, Till I have quite destroy'd th'unnumber'd Armies Of the Earth-covering and confounding Tamerlane, And all the World his Subjects, but thy self; Then I will fight with thee, and thou shalt kill me, And, if thou canst forbear to dye, live after. Zey. Thou hast o'rcome: Reason has lost the day, That useless part of Man, till Love's away. [Exeunt. The Scene Tamerlane's Tents. Ragl. Now is the time: Prince Zeylan's on the Wing, And he shall seize his Prey; thanks to his unknown Friend. A lesser loss than her's, cou'd ne'r have rais'd Revenge so high as his Ingratitude. Honor, that wavering Judge, here interposes, Which turns to every Tale: Honor, that spins Fine curious Paralels, that never meet: What says she then? First, I must right my self; And then, not wrong the Public. Rare distinction Public! fine Canting word, the Public! Are my Arms, Or Legs, joyn'd to the Public? Am I in pain When this Man's hang'd, that Tortur'd? Do I eat The less, when this Man starves? Or when he's Froze Or burnt, do I feel that by my Fire side or Grotto? But, each man's private good lurks in the Public? Then, each man take his part, and where's the Public? Oh, but the Public is the Store-house! No: Rather the Jayl, that keeps mens private goods Confin'd. I'll get mine out, and set the rest on fire. My private Pleasure is my well-known Soveraign good: T'obey and gratifie each strong Impulse Of Friendly Nature. What makes the Public? Power. And what destroys the Public? Why, Power again, Then let this Power dispose the Public still; My private Will shall rule that angry Power. Enter Tamerlane, Axalla, Irene. Alarm within, and Clashing of Swords. Tam. What means this noise! Mess. The Enemy is entred, And has repuls'd your Guards. Prince Zeylan's coming to This Tent. Iren, For Heav'ns sake, Sir, Be gone into this inner Room: there's a back-door to't. Tam. Is Zeylan come? I'll to my coward Guards, And teach th'advent'rous Rebel to be tamer. [Exeunt. Alarm without, Fighting on the Stage. Zeylan is beat off. Re-enter Tamerlane, Axalla, Ragalzan. Tam. What a bold Rebel's this! No more of mercy, Since 'tis despis'd; Axalla, Give order for a General Assault: I'll to the Temple, and give thanks to Heav'n For this success. [Ex. with Axalla. Rag. But I'll be there before you; To just Revenge, one disappointment shall Not stop my progress: Now I'll trust my self. I know the Mummy Priest, a cunning fellow; By's Nature much, but by's Profession more: He's one of those that deal 'twixt Gods and Men, A Commerce never yet well understood, And so they Cheat accordingly. But has Revenge such pow'rful pleasing Charms? Receiving Good, 's a Toy to doing Harms. Revenge, the Gods best Dish, their close-kept Dainty, 'Tis their Ambrosia, not to be tasted By groveling Mortals; and forbid to all, But bold Promethean Souls; borrowing, because Able to re-imburse the Gods again. With lofty Passions of immortal Wrath. Equally powerful still are Contraries: Hate's the reverse of Love; Revenge is Hate's fruition: Nor do I know what's sweetest, or to have My Mistress in my Bed, my Foe in's Grave. The Scene the outer part of a Temple. Enter Tamerlane, Axalla, Ragalzan. Tam. I like their Temples, but I loath their Idols: To all those Beings, that our Senses reach not, Forms are injurious; much more to the Greatest. Ax. I hate no less weak Superstitious Fools; Who, with fond Attributes, th'eternal Being Reproach, and make more Antic than Mankind. Like Boys, they fear the Bugbears that they dress. Tam. True. Heav'n delights more in the sweet variety And liberty of thought, than Slanderous Piety: As a great Monarch him to Favour chuses Who pleasant, but well-manner'd freedom uses, But hates a sowre, tho an obedient Clown Who loves his Smiles, less than he fears his Frown; So Heav'n's great Soul, dress'd in impervious Rayes, The object of our Wonder and our Praise, Laughs at our holy Gambols from above: But those do chiefly his affection move Who play in's Beams with a well-guessing Love, For the Great Nature takes delight, to see The Foot-ball play of Human Sophistry, Nor willing to be known, loves Men shou'd doubt, Guess at his Riddles, but not find 'em out. Music. Ragalzan appears at a corner of the Stage, with a Priest. Rag. What, am I well disguis'd? Priest. Mummy it self, Sir. Here is a Vault, and here's the Trap-door to't; It has a thousand Labyrinths within, Not made for nothing: Let 'em search till Doomsday, They'l never find you. Pugh! the Western Priests Are not the only Laughers at Mankind. [Exit, with Ragalzan, who takes his Place among the Mummies. The Scene opens, and discovers an Amphitheatre of Crown'd Mummies. Iren. These Mummies are more Curious and Magnificent Than those we saw at Cairo. Ax. And much more numerous: Which answers not amiss, to the prodigious space Of time, suppos'd by their Chronology. Tam. Of all the Arts that short-breath'd Man affects To patch, and piece up ruinous Humanity, Aping of Immortality in Dust Sure is the noblest. Ax. Yet they are Death's Trophies. 'Tis strange, that Man shou'd glory to be Conquer'd, And boast his losses to all after Ages. Tam. Proud of his pickled Principality, When Fame finds nothing in his life, to blow. Her Trumpet for, and wake the list'ning World. Ax. And Fame's as false: Cheats us of present Sums, The daily Rents of Pleasure and of Ease, To pay in Honor's Airy dry Reversion, And disputable Titles; Good, or ill, By dead men unperceiv'd, by th'living undistinguish'd. Enter Mummy Priest, habited like a Conjurer, &amp;c. Priest. Greatest of Emperors, draw near, and see The richest Wardrobe of Mortality The World affords: Here stand Time-daring Mummies Of China Monarchs for ten Thousand years. Shou'd I relate you all, their Deaths and Lives, Their Arms, their Arts, their Children, and their Wives; 'Twou'd tire your patience, or to hear, or see, And Conquer, Sir, your Magnanimity. Tam. Troth, I believe thee. What a horrid Tone, And what a monstrous Tale! Ax. They 've long Traditions; And Lye by old Records, as well as Hear-says. Tam. No, no. Printing has been here in use some Thousands of years, no wonder they have so many Lyes. Whose Mummy's this? Priest. This is Viteio, The builder of an University, Who liv'd one Hundred and Fifty years. Iren. And whose is this? Priest. Ochanti; the Inventer of Printing. Iren. And this? Priest. Tzinzummey. The Inventer of Gun-powder: that frighted hence a certain rambling Prince, Call'd Alexander, from the Oxidrace; Which he, good Man, mistook for Thunder, and For Lightning. Tam. A small excuse wou'd serve a Western Conqueror. This crook-back'd Prince here? Priest. Huy Hannon. He that found out the Philosophers Stone. Tam. And this? Priest. Pintatei: his unfortunate Successor, that lost it. Ax. This fellow Drolls. Tam. No; 'tis their Tradition. Iren. Who is this here? Priest. Auchosan. He that Invented. Wagons, to Sail with the Wind. Tam. Are all your Princes then Philosophers? Axalla walks forward. Priest. No. But whoever finds an admirable Art, Is strait made Governor of some wealthy Province, And his Invention is ascrib'd unto The King, whose Reign he liv'd in. Tam. Hansome exchange, and nourishment for Virtue! Priest. Here stands the great Tzionzon, builder of the Wall. Iren. He stares, and turns about his head. Oh horrid! Tam. 'Tis strange! Priest. Marvel not, Sir; 'tis usual with him: He seems offended at your Conquests here. Ragalzan leaps down, Stabs at Tamerlane: Irene interposes. He and the Priest leap down the Trap-door. Tam. Treason! My Guards! What, vanish'd through this door? Ax. Ha! What's the matter? where's the Mummy-shower? Tam. Ah, Generous Girl! Art thou not hurt, Irene? Iren. No, not at all. The Dagger struck upon this Bracelet Here, of Beads. Tam. A piece of Piety well plac'd: Thanks be to Heav'n. Enter Guards. The fellow was in hast. Ax. Where is the Villain? Guards, go search him out, Tam. 'Tis to no purpose: they have endless Vaults. Excellent Maid! how durst thou interpose Thy tender Limbs, that elsewhere art afraid Of thy own Shadow? Iren. It was my Duty, Sir, and my Desire To save your Life, tho ransom'd by my own. Tam. Never was Child so fond, and so indearing! When, at the Siege of Bagdat, in my Tents A Saracen, with an invenom'd Knife, Had Stabb'd me in the Arm, the subtil Poyson Hasting through all the Crimson Salliports To reach the Throne of Life: She strait, with greedy kindness, suck'd the Poyson, And with her Balmy breath heal'd up the part, Which all the helps of bold, but needy, Art Had ne'r effected. Ax. I have heard the Story; And she untainted. Who can hurt an Angel? I know, I feel her Virtues. But, what mean you? Shall I not fetch more Soldiers? Tam. 'Tis work for a whole Regiment: go call 'em, And let 'em scour the Vaults for many Miles, And seize on all those wretched Priests they meet with. I'll turn their Idol Temples all to Mosques, Or Christian Churches: The Devil here is Worship'd In greater State, than elsewhere his Creator. All Impious Priests are vile, but weak dissemblers; They brave the Gods, but purblind Mortals fear, Yet play at Hide and Seek with the All-seer: Juglers, that in Sear'd Mouths take holy Fire, In whom Religion, Physic of the Mind, By which true Souls are purged, and refin'd, Grows so familiar that it never works, But feeds ill Humors, and like Venom lurks. Enter Soldiers. 1 Sol. We shall have brave Plund'ring and Firing here! Heigh Boyes! 2 Sol. I; and hanging up these Conjuring Priests. 3 Sol. For my part, I do not like this Sacrilege. 4 Sol. Why, is it Sacrilege, to take away That which was given in God's name, to the Devil's use? The Soldiers search; Devils meet 'em at one hole, and fright 'em, then another: then flashes of Lightning and Smoak. The Scene shuts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE II. The out-part of the Fort: Tamerlane's Tents on the other side. Enter Philarmia, Zeylan. Phil. 'Twas bravely done! one of your worthy Spoils, To catch the Scythian Lion in your Toils, Then let him go! Seem'd it to your great Mind So small a Prize, Great Tamerlane t'have joyn'd To Bajazet, and in one Cage confin'd? The Scourge and Terror of the World t'have tam'd, And for his Conquest of the Globe been fam'd? All for a Complement! a Barbarous glance From a She-Tartar! Zeyl. 'Twas th'effect of Chance: For, while I paid Irene short Respects, For thy sake only, honoring thy Sex, The Emperor escap'd. But, is't not Jealousie, That envious Dream, that avaritious Monster, That wou'd have more than all, that fills thy Mind With such unkind expostulations? Tell me. By Heav'ns thou wound'st me with ten Thousand Arrows Sharper than Death, Dishonor, Pains Infernal! How can my heart, brim full of thee, receive Another in? Can the whole World, with all It's glittering Trifles, and Deluding Joys, Add ought to my possession, having thee? Or can the Gods, with unexhausted Stocks Of Benefits, reach down a greater blessing To Charm my Soul, or pull up my Ambition Into a higher Sphere, than thy Embraces? What have I more to wish or pray for? Speak. Phil. I Jealous! what of you? For which of your Perfections; Your Valor, or your Prudence? No, no; but I'm asham'd To own so false a Creature. Farewell, You Man of War: I'll try your mettle. [Exit. He strives to stay her: she breaks from him. Zeyl. Nay, stay, and hear me. Pray Heav'n our Loves prove not unfortunate; This Girl's so rash and daring, and so Jealous, So easily provok'd, headstrong, and sudden: Tho soft as Prayers when pleas'd, and passionately Tender, when she perceives her error. My Soul akes for thee, tho I cannot guide thee. [Exit. Enter Ragalzan. Rag. Strange disappointment this too! yet I find There's no suspicion of my Treason. Nothing To Holy Villany! Am I a Saint, or not? The Saint and Devil differ in Man so little, Those open bare-fac'd Mortals look as simply As naked Dogs, or new-shorn Sheep, expos'd To th'Injuries and Scorn of all Mankind: While I, like visiting Angels, kill unseen. Here I lye round, and close, as sleeping Serpents: He that treads on me, feels before he sees me. Enter Tamerlane. Now to my post: I must draw near, and flatter. Tam. 'Tis time my bus'ness of the World were done; Or this Cameleon Fortune may change colours, And Tarnish all my Glories. Why was I Now so unhappy to escape this blow? Then I had dy'd in time, and ripe for Fate, With all my Triumphs waiting on my Herse. Rag. aside. I'm sorry for't indeed, Sir. Tam. Methinks, I find a boding of some mischief, Which threatens, more than Thousand Lives, my Fame. Enter Axalla. Ax. The fair Despina is arriv'd, and begs to be Admitted: And I hear, she hates Th'unfortunate, like Cleopatra; hoping To be the object of your choice. Your late Severity to her harsh Husband, she Counts as a piece of Courtship done to her. Tam. Hast thou now known me, Friend, so many years, And didst thou ever find my easie heart Melt at a Woman's Face? Those many Thousand Wives, Virgins, Widows, all my Supplicants, Mov'd me no more, than Pictures do a Statue That stands upon its Basis. No; I am Beauty-proof: Bring in the little Image, Made up of little Arts, and lesser Charms; I'll blow 'em off. Ax. This Conquest o're your self Out-does the CÅsars, more than all your Triumphs. Tam. Why talk'st thou of those petty Lords of Rome? What is their Carthage, or Numantia, To Nanquin, Pequin, Mosco, Cambalu, Casbin, and Cairo, and Constantinople, Quinzay, and Babylon, Dehli, and Agra? And canst thou think my Soul can yield to Charms Which wrought upon those idle-headed CÅsars, Who in Triumphant Cars, like Flies on wheels, Assum'd the glory of that little dust Which their Crampt Empire rais'd in several Ages? When I alone have won more Worlds, than e're They knew or thought of. Rag. They set some Scriblers to out-lye the World, And drest their Roman Eagles up, to Soar Like Paper Kites, t'amuse the wondring Vulgar: And yet the very Plat-forms of your Conquests Wou'd cover all the Earth they ever Fought for. Tam. My actions are too great for all Records, They tire Narrations, baffle formal Words. Ax. Right, Sir; but own the Cause. This vanity Sticks close, like Ivy to the noblest Plants. Tam. True, my Axalla; but shou'd I speak less, I shou'd detract from Heav'n, that threw these Favors Upon my worthless Person. Enter Despina. Ax. Here she comes: Now be your self, and His that made you great. Tam. Ha! What flash of Lightning's this, that strikes my Brest? Then Fame has once spoke true; a Glorious Form! But I must be my self; nay, more, appear Churlish and Cruel, to keep off vain hopes. Desp. Great Sir, to whom wise Heav'n the World design'd, kneeling. As a just Tribute to your greater Mind; Long may you Reign, if Bajazet may live: A Grant which Heav'n alone, and You, can give. We cancel all the Rights that Fortune gave, And Life alone, the gift of Nature, crave: Show the same mercy you had wish'd to find If Fortune had to Him, not You, been kind. Tam. Do as you wou'd be done to, Rules no State; Nor yet is Nature's Law: for in close competitions Where Life's at Stake, if you do not destroy Your Rival's life, your own you can't enjoy; Yet none wou'd grant to let himself be slain, Tho by his death another life did gain. My Case is clearer, just in all mens Sence, To kill your Husband in my own defence: Which is no more than he wou'd do by me, Or ought to do, if he secure wou'd be. Desp. High Confidence o're Policy prevails; When great Souls meet, low-founded Reason fails: Brave Sympathy does Interest disdain; Or 'tis an Int'rest of a nobler Strain, To please themselves by pleasing's all their gain. Tam. You talk of Friends, or Lovers, lukewarm mortals That have not heat enough t'inflame themselves With high-flown Thoughts, and Self-determin'd Actions: Give me Ambition that is ne'r extinguish'd, Yet feeds upon it self; burns like the Sun In its own Centre unconsum'd, And warms or Scorches, whom it please, at distance. Souls that are inaccessible, and high, Are strictest followers of the Deity: Humble Mankind copies the Low Creation, And makes the tamest Animals their Guides; Out-done still by the Strong and wise ones. Desp. Shou'd Gods destroy all Men that them provoke, They must Create, to make their Altars Smoke; If all were kill'd that do affect your Throne, King without Subjects, you wou'd Reign alone A Monarch wrapt in Contemplation: Freed from your Rivals, you expose your Life To a hast'ning Son, or nature-urging Wife, To some brave Brutes, or King-contemning Flies, And Death will come by Siege, if not Surprise. Was all the World for your vain Self design'd? Or, if it be the Int'rest of Mankind To have you dye, why do you wish to live, When Social Joys you neither take nor give? Tam. How bold her Reason! how Divine her Face! What do I feel? some strange, but Cordial heat: Some Passion shakes my Reason from her Seat. Desp. The road to Fame's to try unpractic'd ways; From common Methods, rises common Praise: Blood has to Glory ever been a Cheat; Let Mercy make you Famous, Safe, and Great. When Fortune shares so much in each event, Distraining Mortals goods for Heav'nly Rent, Prudence in vain a Monarch's life protects: Counsels Inspir'd produce the best effects. Tam. 'Tis time to fly! Madam, you argue well: Let time digest My thoughts, and ripen them for your request. [Ex. severally. Rag. If I remember well my former frailties, This discomposure in the Prince, is Love: If it be so, there is enough to work on. Other attempts are Dangerous, Rash, Uncertain: This flattering Distemper works as sure Destruction: he shall be his own Tormentor; His Life and Fame shall languish e're he dyes. I'll strait to Bajazet, who loves this Wife More than his Empire; tell him, She's already In Tamerlane's embraces: That in him, Will work some fatal Passion; and in her, Revenge as desperate. [Exit. Re-enter Tamerlane. Tam. To Arms, to Arms, my Soul; and stop the passage To this weak Enemy. Love, thou poor trifle of Unactive Minds, drowsie Divinity, Music for Maids or Madmen, School-boy's Toy, Thou pinching Play-fellow, tickling Tormentor; Thou fawning Cut-throat Begger, hence, be gone, My Brest affords no settlement for Vagrants: Go to some Silken Persian, soft Italian, To limber Courtiers, callow beardless Boys; Go find some lazie Epicure, whose Soul Lives in his Dish, and thence by Transmigration, Lives in his Wench, and when that short-liv'd pleasure Expires, is born anew to Wine and Surfeits. How darest thou seek for room in my full Mind, In which the Universe lies cram'd with all its cares, Where every Virtue harbors for protection, And every Vice waits for a Reformation? And yet, methinks I see the blind ragg'd Boy Laughing the tott'ring Globe out of my hand: It must not, shall not be. He comes, he comes Again, and warms my Brest with his false Fires. Captains, let loose the World, that I may once more Conquer't; Strike off the Chains from all my fetter'd Princes, Let 'em Rebel, and find out Manly troubles To shake off these: Let Bus'ness out-do Reason. Go build more Ships, search out some Savage Corner That Nature hides, or evil Spirits guard, From Manners, or Religion; there I'll go, Subdue, Reform: Let Mankind once more prove How much my Reason does out-weigh my Love. The Scene a Prison. Bajazet in his Cage; Ragalzan, Jaylor. Rag. It is too true: The Emperor has deny'd her to come near you. Baj. And did I live so long, only to see her? Rag. Nay, more than that, This night She is design'd For his Embraces. Baj. Death! Furies! Hell! Damnation! Fires! and Flames! You Sacred Bugbears, false invented names, To fright Mankind into Religious Fits; Where is the Justice of the Sacred Writs? You Rascal Mahomet, am I thus requited? My Prayers, my Services, my Off'rings slighted? Is this your thanks? I scorn thee, thou'rt a Cheat; I made thee Holy, but to make me Great: Thou brok'st the Contract first. Where is thy Love? Where is thy Int'rest with the Powers above? If such there be, what cross events they give, That I, who scorn to Reign, am forc'd to live? Rag. Majestic Blasphemy! It works most bravely. Jayl. What says the Prince? Rag. He does Blaspheme and Rave, Talks something that is Wicked, and is Brave: Like modern Heroes. Baj. See, see! She comes all glorious to the Bed Of dirty Tamerlane, design'd to breed A race of running Tartars! Merciless Gods, I cannot, will not bear it. [Knocks his head against the Cage. Rag. So I'll be gone. Jaylor, go help him forwards, I'll prefer thee: 'Tis time his mouth were stopt; the vile Blasphemer! It is the Emperor wills it. Jayl. Then 'tis done, Sir. Rag. 'Twill make mad work, i'faith! Now She'l abhor Great Tamerlane, and do some worthy Mischief, And I shall be her Confident; for, if The Emperor Loves, Axalla will decline The scandalous Office: I shall guide th'Intrigue: For still I sooth his proud o'rweening Spirit To his Destruction. Fool, to think such blows Can be forgot, or salv'd with Balmy Flattery! Injuries are Immortal; kept alive By those that give, no less than those that take 'em: One justly hopes, the other fears Revenge, Purchasing Safety by a second blow. Tame Christians court Affronts: Let him not live, And Worship Mahomet, that can forgive. [Exit. Axalla, Irene. Ax. D'ye hear the news? Iren. What, of my Father's Love? Ax. Nay, more than that; The death of Bajazet: Just now found dead in's Cage, wallowing in's Blood. Iren. 'Tis strange! I'm sure 'twas not my Father's act. Ax. I cannot tell: this Love will change a man As much as a new Faith; and Proselytes At their admission are injoyn'd great Tasks. Enter Despina weeping, and Ragalzan. Here comes the Mourner, and the Mischief-maker: I like not their acquaintance. Iren. I wonder that he finds such Favor with the Emperor! Ax. That his quick Eye sees not his bungling Flattery, The Seam's so visible and gross! Desp. Oh sad, sad Story! Rag. 'Twas as I told you; and your Dream confirms it. Iren. Oh, they come near! How can I bear with patience The sight of her, that gives so great disquiet To my great Father; blasts his glorious Name? Rag. Madam, did you observe? Desp. What makes the Princess fly me? Am I brought hither to be scorn'd, as well as injur'd? These are your Tartarian manners! Rag. 'Tis not her Education, but Religion; She's bred a Christian, and betroth'd to this Axalla: 'Twas they perswaded th'Emperor to this Murder. Desp. Did they? a wondrous Act! Oh, my dear Sultan! Just Heav'ns lend me the Power to vindicate his wrongs; Send me the Furies, I will turn 'em Saints By this my holy Justice. Oh, oh, oh! (Weeps.) Rag. And, since this peevish Girl has heard her Father's Passion, She Vows she'l never see you; tho you shou'd stoop To be her Father's Wife. Desp. A pretty Spark! But I will see her, tho I walk through Flames To meet her. Enter Tamerlane. Tam. Bless me, 'tis sad! I was to blame, to urge His patience to that height: and yet he scorn'd All offers at my hands, and had design'd For me, the self-same Cage, taken at Tauris. 'Tis true, I order'd that Despina shou'd Not yet come near him; but that was not well. Ha! there she is, and I begin to change; In vain I struggle with Love's mighty Yoke, And the contention 'twixt two powerful Passions Layes wast my Mind. This Soultry heat of Love has scorch'd up quite The temperate Climes of Virtue: I'm become Like the Arabian Desart, dry, unfruitful, Where nothing grows for Mankind's use, 'Tis all but horrid Rocks, and Precipices, And Tempest-beaten Sands to blind Mens eyes, And bury 'em alive. How can I give Account of my great Charge? Rag. He's in his Passion: now I'll give him counsel. Might I presume to guess your Royal troubles, The beauteous Captive gives you some disquiet. Tam. Audacious Wretch! how dar'st thou search into Thy Sovereign's Brest, and rudely touch his Sores? Rag. You pity, Sir, her Husband's dismal Fate. Tam. True: with unfeigned Sorrow. Rag. But, Sir, may I proceed a little farther? And 'tis my humble care for your contentment, And the continuance of your spotless Fame, Tho for my duty I shou'd meet my death By my too forward Zeal: yet I will speak My Conscience for the Public. Tam. Speak thy Grievance. Rag. The death of Friends is but a Skin-deep wound To tough Mankind: The Earth is over-stock'd, The Feeding's bare; the less the Herd, the fatter. What then of Foes, or Rivals? Love's a Passion No Hero ought to blush for; 'tis their own: It is the noblest error of great Minds, Or a perfection rather; born of the Same Parent Valor is, excess of Heat: 'Tis a Majestic Madness, Heav'nly Fury; None ever scap'd it of the Gods, or Heroes. Tam. What then? Speak out. Rag. Why then, 'tis strongly rumor'd That you are touch'd with that Celestial frailty. Tam. Is it divulg'd so soon? Well then, since thou Hast guess'd so well, I'll tell thee my Disease. She is the first of all that trivial Sex That ever gain'd the out-works of my Heart, A kind Esteem; but more, S'has fir'd the Fort, And turn'd out all the vigorous Defendants, The Manly Virtues that secur'd the Place: I ne'r knew Love before, but for State Int'rest, Which pawns the Prince's Body for the Public. Rag. So much the worse. The first Loves are most dangerous: The rest are flashes, Sparkles of the former, Doubly reflected Rainbows, dying Ecchoes; Diseases of the Brain are seldom cur'd, And their first Fits most fatal, if delay'd. What fills the World with Madmen? Is't not Love? Tam. My Reasoning faculty, that was my guide, Is so bewildred in this Hellish Fog, That I do often grope for't, seldom find it. Is there no Cure for this? Rag. One, very natural: Breathing of a Vein in Fevers, Or giving Vent to Vessels that wou'd break. Tam. Oh; but Discourse and Time, may Conquer Passion. Rag. Stay till a tickling Cough turns a Consumption, For want of taking such a Sugar'd Medicine. Statesmen in Love begin their Alphabet, 'Tis a new World, an undiscover'd Coast. I've lov'd, Enjoy'd; and Lov'd, and lost: There is No Rock, nor Shelf, in all the dangerous Road Of Woman, but I am your Pilot for't. Take it from me, tho Honor gets the better, 'Tis a most costly Victory: puts you to Th'expence of many thoughtful hours, and wasts A wise Man's Brain, that's fit for nobler uses. Love lyes in Ambush; when you think the least on't, Rallies again, and routs th'unsetled Victor: And, tho 'tis oft pluck'd up with endless labor, The rank Weed still appears. But think I, you shou'd make a Life of Passion, To whine, and dally, and to truck for hearts. Some Months, or Years, like other common Mortals? A Prince's Love's to like, and to enjoy; And then at once away with Love, and puling Passion. Tam. Are there no limits then for Princes Passions? Rag. There may be; yet 'twere better to be eas'd At any rate, than leave the World neglected: Millions of Souls draw vital breath from yours. The Soldiers murmur that you stop your Progress; Pausing upon such Toys; yet take this Cordial: Fortune has made her free, without your guilt. Attempt to gain her Love by fair persuasion, And take her to your Wife. Tam. 'Twere not unlawful; But; oh, 'tis Rash, 'tis Base, 'tis out of Season. Rag. Then will you still expose this worthy Passion To your deriding Foes, and grieving Friends; Carry the Baby Love about the Army, And ask the Soldiers how it does become you? Ta. Thy Reasons have som weight: my Thoughts are wandred, And blown about with every gust of Passion, For want of Reason's Ballast.âHere she comes, Enter Despina. And turns thy Problems all to Demonstrations! Rag. I, and she comes to court you: pray make use on't. Desp. Down, down proud Billows of my Stormy Brest, Be calm one moment, till I search a little The great Disturber of my injur'd Soul: Then rage again till Fury bids you cease. Sir, can you spare no Cordial for my Fears? No Balm, to stop this issue of my Tears? Or must I be the Fountain of your Court, To weep in Artful forms, to make you Sport? Tam. Dry Clouds, and empty Griefs long hide the day; The Dismal'st Vapors weep themselves away: Those Eyes will shine again, or Heav'n decay. Desp. Talk not of Lustre, Sir; restore my Light, And give me the lov'd object of my Sight. Tam. (Aside ... ) She knows not of his death; what need I name it? By the quick notice on't, and his hard usage, She'l think I caus'd it: but I will prepare her, As if she made the most severe Conjectures. ( ... Aside) Well, Madam, none with Reason can deny Their own request: Suppose adjudg'd to dye A Prisoner was, at whose obnoxious birth The Squint-ey'd Stars shot vengeance on the Earth Heav'ns Fiery Flail, the Whip for restive Mortals, To make'm draw through Flames and Yokes of Iron, The Mildew of your Hopes, Seed of your Fear; And wou'd you in exchange that Prisoner spare? Desp. Were he the greatest Monster Nature teem'd From her erronious Womb; Satan redeem'd, And once again relapsing to his Nature, Plotting to cheat the winking wise Creator; The Plague-sore of the World, Factor to Fate, Bloody as reason of Usurping State Or, if to save his Life, I lost my own My Bajazet should live; nay live without a Throne. But, oh! Tam. Then here your Captive stands, Chain'd fast in Cupids thin, but glutenous Bands; Strong, tho unseen; like those of Fate, I feel Love's Airy Nets, those Cobwebs made of Steel: Pity the Wretch whom all extreams do move, Who cannot hope for, live without your Love. Desp. Dost thou abuse me too! thou needst not wear Such study'd Cruelty to mock Despair. I came to tast, not swallow Candyed Poysons; Curious to know, how many Sulphurous Devils That weak and Leaky Vessel Man, Hoop'd with Hypocrisie, might hold, who is A Pastboard Cask, a very Sieve to Virtue. Tyrant, I come not to divert my Fate, But to chafe on, and scarifie thy Hate. Phlegmatick Fiend, Dull Devil, dost thou think Thy Murders can be stifled, Gods can Wink, When such great Stars as Bajazet add Light To Heav'n, &amp; make thy Crimson'd Earth more bright? Hid in their blackness dost thou think thy Deeds? Thy Cloven Foot peeps through thy Hermits Weeds. Tam. How quickly she had notice of his death! Desp. Curs'd be thy ill-got Empire, curs'd thy Race, Live to its own destruction, thy disgrace: And when thy Rebel Offspring is subdu'd, Thy trembling Hand in thy own Blood embru'd; Then may thy Passions war against each other, Tear out the Bowels of their wretched Mother: May Lust and Pride, the Idols of the Great, Command still contraries, and mock thy Prayers; Torn with wild Horses of cross-drawing Cares, Those Brazen Bulls due to their Ingineers; May hopes spring up, and still be choak'd with Fears, And may'st thou always aym, and ever miss: I wish thee a long life; but such as this. Tam. Pray give me leaveâ Desp. Nor dye thou by thy Sorrows, Sword or Laws; For I would have thee live, without a Cause. May still some Clouds of hopeless Passion blind When Honour, with its Sunshine, cheers thy Mind: Ne'r mayest thou Love, but find the Women chast; Nor e'r be proud, but by scorn'd love abas'd: And when thy slie misfortunes flatter most, May each nak'd Beauty prove a rotten Ghost. May Schreech Owls make thy Musick, Toads thy Pictures, Thorns and ill Conscience stuff thy Beds of down: And may thy Torments never find a date, Till Heav'n wants power to Plague, or Hell to hate. Ex. Tam. Bless me! what Thunder, and what Lightning too! Rag. Oh, Sir, she is the haughtiest, and the wyliest Dame, That ever liv'd. Tam. Yet she appear'd so sweet, so innocent, Who look'd for Storms from so serene a Sky? Good Gods, what Charms! Her very Frowns are Philtres. Her Treaty undermin'd my tender part; This noble Rage fires and blows up my heart. Rag. And 'twas a just one too. Have you not us'd Her Husband like a wild Beast, and incag'd him, Made him your Footstool, worse Indignities Than Death it self, deny'd her to come near him, And since, as she thinks, caus'd him to be murder'd? Tam. Heav'n knows, I knew not of his death, but greive for't. Rag. And I know too; but what can salve the wild Objections of a blear-ey'd Jealous mind, To whom well polish'd Truth looks most like Varnish, And Arguments serve but for Aggravations? Most Men believe you caus'd it; and 'tis talk'd of; For 'tis the Fate of wise Men, to be thought To act what Interest, not Justice bids them: And Histories do oftner palliate Crimes, Than publish 'em: There is more Wickedness Than all the Worlds aware of, (or you either. Aside.) To clear the Truth is now impossible, Since she has found you love her; which she'l judge To be the cause, more than State-Rivalship. But, wou'd you take my Judgement, Sir, I'de own it, And say, I did it for her Love, not Empire. Tam. What! Shall I own a Lye, and wound my Honor? Rag. What, by a little Love-talk, blown away With the next Wind? Ten Lyes to every Truth; Where he that talks the most, still thinks the least on't. Love is a Lye it self; there's no such Passion: And Truth to Women makes men most suspected, Because 'tis rarely practic'd. No Woman takes her self to be a Monster; Yet she wou'd be so, if her Eyes were Stars, Her Lips of Roses, and her Face of Lillies: Why, Traps were made for Foxes, Gins for Hares, Limetwigs for Birds, and Lyes and Oaths for Women. Tam. Thou'rt a rare Artist in Love's Mysteries! But then, suppose this shou'd incense her more? Rag. Why, then 'tis but t'unswear the same things o'r Again: How can a credulous Woman Discern a Truth, from Falshood; Her Reason yields, and Passion takes the Sway? Then swear there are no Stars, because 'tis Day That hides them all; Truth is asham'd to stay, And dares not show her naked open brest To an excuse that's rich, and finely drest. Tam. Oh brave Ragalzan! thou canst turn and wind A Woman, like an Engine. Rag. They're no more; Manag'd as easily by dexterous Men: Work up their Passions, then they are on Horseback Without a Bridle; drive 'em where you please. As we are to the Gods, so they to us Are meer Machines. Tam. I, such Machines, as Ships, that drown their Sailors; Such Brutes, as break their Masters Necks. Well, I may use some Art, yet cannot travel Far from the Road of Honor: But I am rough, and ne'r was made for Courtship. Rag. Great Souls are fit for all things; Try your Rhetoric, Which never fail'd you yet to win Mankind: Woman is easier gain'd; Nature's your Party, And lays 'em open to the least attacks. Exit Tam. 'Tis hard, when a Man's own Wit runs so low, that he is forc'd to let in the Tide of another Mans Counsel; 'tis as fatal and slavish, as borrowing of Money. Now will Despina, when she's a little cooler, tell him that formal Tale I told her; How, that upon very high, and opprobious Language to the Emperor, one of the Keepers, by his order, struck Bajazet,that he dyed on't: which is not so very Barbarous, but Tamerlane perhaps will own it a little to try her temper; but he shall never be believed, if he unswear it a Thousand times. He is a Man of so much Honor, that a Lye of his is more credible than a Verdict of Twelve Men. 'Tis not good to use a Man's self to be too punctual: 'tis too like an Engine; Every Man knows where to have him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Tamerlane, Despina, Ragalzan following. Rag. So, so, the works is doing, and my Pupil Is strong in Argument against himself. What neither Hate nor Reason could suggest, Nor Malice hope for, Beauty has supply'd; What all the Universe could ne'r have shaken, One Female has subverted: That great Mind, That thought the World too little, creeps and fawns Like a well-beaten Spaniel. Now's the time, Now he lies open, bare from the protection Of his own Virtues, by the Gods forsaken, Bound hand and foot by Woman, and deliver'd To my Correction: But I'le use him gently, Gently as Bears the Robbers of their Whelps, as Lions The Men that stick their Javelins in their sides, As Clowns their Plunderers, Thieves broke loose their Judges, As Lawyers Clyents, or Electors Ale, As Brokers Bankrupts, Senates needy Princes, Trustees a Minor, Priests a sinful Purse, Mad Dogs their Mates, and Wives their Husbands Whores. Tam. Dreams are but Vapors of some Thoughts mislay'd, Still'd and retorted without Reasons Aid, Poysons of Quiet by ill mixtures made. Desp. Awake I saw and heard his bleeding Ghost, And of this Barbarous Fact thy Tartars boast: And didst not thou strive to conceal it most? Tam. aside. Too strong Presumptions make Denyals vain; Truth is not seen by Judgements prepossest, No more than Light by Eyes with Rheume opprest: I'll try what use of Fiction may be made. Then tell me, Madam, how has Fame traduced me? Desp. Fierce Hypocrite, when thou hadst him deny'd The sight of me, whom he lov'd more than Life, Or Health, or Fame; tho at thy mercy Cag'd, A Generous disdain fill'd his brave mind, He call'd thee wandring Tartar, Conquering Begger, That Want, not Honor, forc'd thy starveling Soul To prey abroad, and urge thee to a Fortune Thou ne'r desir'dst, nor dream'd of: strait his Keeper, By thy fierce Frowns incourag'd, gave the Prince A fatal blow. Who falling down, Is this thy Zeal, he cry'd? This thy Devotion, Tamerlane? and dy'd. Tam. It was my Zeal, and my Devotion too, If not to Heav'n, or Nature, yet to You: Fame, the forerunner of your Conquering Eyes, That wand'ring Tell-tale, made my Heart your Prize. What Interest or Safety ne'r cou'd woo, The dawning of your Light forc'd me to do; What may your Form, full Risen, tempt me to? Rivals on Earthly Thrones may claim a Station, But Violence for Heav'n is soft Persuasion: Beauty belongs to him that Worships best, Exalts her Deity above the rest, Tramples on Law, Religion for her sake. Desp. Impious wretch! must I thy Crimes partake? No, Tyrant, 'twas Ambition mov'd the Wheel, And ground those Reasons, back'd and Edg'd with Steel. Tam. Accuse Tyrannic Heav'n, that made you bright, Accuse those killing Eyes; not my weak Sight. I did a Crime, without my own consent; And Justice pardons, where there's no intent: When Love commands, who dare's be Innocent? Blame not the Ship that falls foul on another; But blame the Winds that blow it: Neighborly Streams Keep in their Destin'd bounds, till Showers from Heav'n Constrain 'em to invade the Friendly Earth With as unquestion'd Power As that which gives it from the highest Cause; Celestial Visions cancel written Laws. Desp. If Man may act what e'r he's mov'd to do, The same Man is both Judge and Party too: Bodies and Souls are so in Marriage ty'd, Their distinct Issues hardly can be try'd; But well known Body is the surer side. Inspired thoughts may flow from Heav'n or Hell, But Ãthiop's Bastards will their Fathers tell: Charge not the Gods with thy Infernal Sins; Murder and Piety cannot pass for Twins. Tam. I urg'd their Power, but now defend their Justice. Impartial Heav'n, not robbing all the rest, Cou'd not permit by one to be possest So great a Joy so long. Too happy Bajazet's compendious youth, Which bath'd in Blisses, envy'd by the Gods, When for one hour of Heav'n in your fair Arms I'de forfeit all my Right to endless Ages. But, if you call a Crime what Heav'n commands, Tho clear'd above, yet I have lost my Cause: In vain that Prisoner pleads his Innocence, Who'd rather dye, than anger his Accuser. Then, if my death can expiate that Act, That controverted Crime 'twixt Heav'n and you, Here, take this Sword; Come, pierce this Amorous brest: Th'Impression made by your fair hand, will be Softer than down of Swans, than Showers of Roses, Softer than Rain on Wool, whose patient Fleeces Take without noise, or murmur, Heavenly Blows; Softer than gentle Air, that breaths from any Lips, but yours, Returns of Passion, Sighs and mutual Vows, Joys and Confessions of Intranced Lovers. Desp. I'll keep thee for a greater punishment; Nor the slow Tortures of just Heaven prevent. Tam. Assume Heav'ns power once more, and punish Laws, Correct the Crime of which you was the Cause: In you 'tis Justice, and I'll ne'r repine To Love, to Sin, to Dye, by Power Divine. Ah, sweet occasion of my Pains! Cou'd all my Pleasures, all my Gains, Empire surrendred, but contract Pardon for one resistless Act: Cou'd my afflicted Soul but have One Tear, to sanctifie my Grave; I'de leave the World, and dying boast That drop in vain, not Asia lost. Desp. Who can believe so false, and fierce a Creature, Blood-purpled Prince of Hypocrites? Tam. She's greater, Who kills and tramples Mankind at her Feet, And yet appears so harmless and so sweet. Desp. No, Tyrant, live; because I loath thy Offering; Repent, and wash thy Venom out with Tears: I wou'd not send the Gods a Present out of season, An unclean Sacrifice, the worst of all the Herd. Thy Sorrow seems the truer, 'cause 'tis just, And Penitence prevails with Powers above: I can afford my Pity, not my Love. Tam. That is to bid me Live, deny me Food, To cure a bleeding Wound with Cordials, or A Fainting Fit with Plaisters. Then Life is given me, but Love deny'd! A wondrous motive for that daring Deed! Dy'd Bajazet for this? that I might Reign. Then I am guilty: take o'r rated Life, Since Villany is grown so poor and cheap To take a Bribe for any thing but Love. Clense not a House on purpose to pull down, Wash not a Bloody Garment, but to wear it; Nor let a Sully'd Coyn, that wears the th'Impression of Your Heav'nly Face, be scour'd and brightned, only To throw away. By Mahomet, and by his Master too, Give me thy Love, and the whole World is thine; That great share I possess: that lesser, left unconquer'd To exercise my Arms, inspir'd by thee; My Fifty Realms, with all the Lives within 'em, Men, Women, Children, Beasts, and every Inch Of ground they feed on in that Spacious Pasture, My Seas with all their Fish, my Air, my Birds, my Clouds; And if the Sun, and Moon, and Stars receive Their Aliment from my exhaled Empire, Then they are mine, and them I'll give thee too: And thou shall call me Niggard when I've done, Unless I gain more Crowns to strow thy feet with. Desp. Well, I'll consider twice, 'fore I undo thee, And All the World, by this large Donative: If you are Real, you may hope for Love. Tam. Wy Word on Earth, my Oath's a Law Above. [Ex. leading her. The Scene the outside of the Fort. Alarms, and Fighting behind the Scenes. Enter Zeylan. Zey. All's lost; but thus far I've escaped: 'Twere better T'have left all to the mercy of Generous Tamerlane; But now't's too late. Yet I am more concern'd for my Philarmia, Than Life, or Fame, or Liberty, or Country. Enter Six or Seven Soldiers. Ha! what, surpriz'd! 1. Sold. Stand, Traytor; yield. 2. Sold. Deliver. Zey. Lives are not sold so cheaply. (Fights, and is disarm'd.) Enter Philarmia, Amazon-like disguis'd. Phil. What shall I do? there is no quarter given, My Zeylan will be slain! Cou'd I but meet him! Oh Heav'ns! he's yonder, ready to be Butcher'd! [Runs upon the Soldiers. Hold, Soldiers, hold; I've Orders from Axalla To save his Life: Hold, hold; he is my Prisoner. Now, with a Fiction, will I try his Faith. Is your name Zeylan? Zey. Yes. Phil. Then, Sir, you own this Favor to a Lady, Whose Interest prevail'd above the Orders of the Emperor The fair Irene; who commanded me To seek you out, and save you. Zey. That life so spar'd, shall be enjoy'd no longer Than till she calls it back, and still employ'd In the most rigorous of her Commands. Phil. But, Sir, such Favors come not, but on Terms: The Princess loves you. Zey. It is her Mercy, sure, but not her Love. Phil. No, no; she Loves you: and with Justice asks Your Love, without a Rival. Zey. Nor is it fit, that so Divine a Princess Shou'd be the sharer only of a Heart, But the intire Possessor. Alass, my humble Thoughts durst never aim At such high flights; but if I ever fix 'em, My Faithful Heart is not to be divided In worthlass Rags, and made a sport for Winds, But Consecrated to one Diety: Love and Religion both admit no more. Phil. So, so; he yields: Oh, the perfidious Wretch! Then shall I bring her back the welcom message Of your true Love? Zey. That's too presumptuous; But of Gratitude, Of unrestrain'd Devotion to her Service, Which neither Death, nor Dangers, shall deter From Desperate Obedience. Phil. Crafty Traytor! He dares not say he loves her; but 'tis plain. I'll probe him deeper: She hears you have a Mistress, call'd Philarmia. Zey. I had; but Heav'n alone can tell, if now I have her. Phil. And did not she deserve your dearest Thoughts? Zey. She was, or is, what nothing can be more. Phil. And is this all? False man! Now to the quick. You must renounce her, or your Life: Be brief. Zey. Renounce her! What, shall I renounce the Gods, Forswear Eternal Joys, and blessed Mansions, Cut off my hopes from Heav'ns Seraphick Pleasures? Then, here, resume your mighty Gift again, My Life has ever been a Slave to Honor; Shall it not serve a Nobler Master, Love? Not all the Tortures, Crosses, Scourges, Chains, Those double Deaths, all the refin'd Inventions That Witty Malice makes for Misery; Not all the Thunders, Lightnings, Earthquakes, Floods, Terrestrial Terrors, or Celestial Fits, The frowns of angry Heav'n, or Smiles of Beauty, Shall force me to abjure such glorious hopes, Or turn Apostate to Divine Philarmia. Phil. Then take thy Life, and thy Philarmia too, [Discovers her self. Thou justest, dearest Soul. Zey. Blest Image! art thou here? Oh, may I trust My Senses, or thy Word? My dear Deceiver! Dear, desperate self-destroyer! Phil. But thy Preserver. Why, did not I foresee that I shou'd save thee? Which is the better Soldier now? Rey. Philarmia. Oh thou art full of Fame; thou may'st retire, Like a rich lazy General. Phil. I'll consider; But here's no time to pour our Passions out, The Army's coming this way: I'll go back, And stop the Soldiers from pursuing thee. Go seek thy safety in some lonesom Cave; Then send me word, and I will find thee out: I'll take my leave of the Victorious World, To share in thy Distresses. Zey. Stay a little: Oh, stay awhile. Who knows when we shall meet? The envious World, with its ill-natur'd Tricks, And Accidental Crosses, may divide us: The Gods themselves desire not, men shou'd have Such filling Joys, as thou and I possess; Lest they should slight eternal Happiness. Oh, let us part no more! how can I leave thee? Phil. Well, well, then I'm content; let me be caught In conference with thee; let me be slaughter'd, Let me be torn alive, since Zeylan wills it: Come let's begin to talk. [Trumpets sound. Zey. Oh, hark, the Trumpet! Hast thou hence like Lightning: Why should I make thee loose thy precious Life, For saving mine? Farewel, Farewel, my Dearest: If I go with thee, we shall both be slain. Phil. Parting, or Death, which is the greater Pain. [Ex. severally. Tamerlane, and Despina, sitting upon Thrones. An Antick Dance, and a SONG. Greatness, I give thee my my excuse, For thee I have no leisure; Nor care what Bus'ness can produce, For Life's too short for Pleasure: Count Griefs, Diseases, Lov's disdains, What need these Artificial Pains? Nature invites us to a Treat, And gives us but short time to stay; While Coxcombs Carve, and Wise Men Eat, Death, the close Waiter, takes away. Count Griefs, &amp;c. Tam. Now, Madam, I'm in Heav'n, my Soul rides high, And treads th'unyielding Air: nothing can sink What you have rais'd so vastly. Where have I slept all those deluding years, And dream'd of Joys, but never tasted any Till this Transporting, Deifying minute? How have I toil'd, turn'd upside down the World, Begging Mens Voices to be counted happy, And at this Fairy Feast have still rose hungry! Drunk with Ambition, I saw all things double; But, when I came to tast the Aery Joys, They fled the feeling. now, my Soul runs over, I am all Joy, all Plenty, all Abundance. Desp. But these imagin'd Joys may come far short Of expectation, cloy you to repentance; And then you'l curse th'Inchantress, and the Syren. Tam. Oh, never, never; I cou'd gaze away My Life, upon these over-powring Charms, This all-supplying Face, till Death did fix me In this Triumphant posture, far more glorious Than all the Statues of the Ancient Heroes, Who fool'd away their Lives for less rewards: Oh, I am all Content, all Wealth, all Pleasure! Well, Madam, have you thought of your demand: That I may pay my Vows; and that great Bond, Drawn betwixt Love and Beauty, that's Recorded In the Eternal Registers, be cancel'd? Desp. I have, Sir; but you'l think it is too much To grant: Alass! my humble, worthless Person Can never merit such a mighty Gift. What is there in me, that could prompt you to So kind, so rash a Vow? You only meant To Conquer, and delude a credulous Woman. Tam. By all the Oaths that I have sworn before, And, if thou urgest, by ten Thousand more, There's nothing in my power that I'le refuse thee. Desp. Then, Sir, deliver up to me your Daughter Bound in Chains; your dear, and fair Irene. Tam. My Daughter, bound in Chains! She is no Thief, Nor Murderer: what Offence has she committed Against your Self, or Me? Pray ask again: Command th'Assyrian, Persian, Grecian Empires, I have enough besides; I'll make thee Greater Than Ninus, Cyrus, or than Alexander, All three united, and yet less than me; But, having me, thou'rt greater than us all: The Emperors of the World are but thy Slaves, When I am thine. But why this vain request? Take the four Monarchs Lands; They are Confiscated, and given to me, For Treason 'gainst their Maker: But why my Pious, dearest Child? What is she guilty of, that can deserve Such Ignominious, fatal reparation? Desp. I see, great Monarchs can dispence with Vows; Such Fetters are not made for boundless Souls, They struggle through 'em: Farewell, mighty Prince; Live long, and fortunate, without Despina. [Exit. Tam. Ha! what a change is this? How soon my Joy's Unravel'd, and my Soul from topmost Stories Sunk to the bottom of most damn'd Despair; Wound up so high, to make her fall the greater! Oh, Senceless, Barbarous, Blindfold, Bestial Wretch! What have I done? deliver'd up my Daughter To certain Death. Heav'n, what a Conflict's this! Not all the Beauties of the Universe shall make me yield to so abhorr'd an Act. But I have Vow'd: But 'twas a Lover's Vow, Whose Perjuries are laugh'd at. No; there is No jesting with Divinity. But how Comes Tamerlane reduced to this necessity? Why, Tamerlane's in Love. A goodly Precedent For envious Posterity to discant on! A fine conclusion of a Glorious Life! Oh Heav'n, the Guide and Prospect of my Actions, Let thy kind Thunder end the shameful doubt: Destroy me at this moment; let me tread No longer these inglorious steps, nor dash Thy unexampled Favors on the Ground By such a childish Act. Love, keep thy distance. But Love now fights under Religion's Banner, And makes it's Folly Sacred. Death must prevent This loathed Act, and expiate th'Intent. [Exit. An Astrologer, Axalla, Irene, a Captain. Thunder, Lightning, Rainbows inverted, a bloody Arm, Comet, &amp;c. Iren. Oh Heav'ns, the dreadful sight! 'Tis Doomsday coming! Ax. Ha! Nocturnal Rainbows! Inverted too! Reflexions answering not the form of Luminous Bodies, And such a Comet as puts out the Stars! Cease, you bold peepers into Nature's bowels, To give the World glossie but fading Reasons: Nature this day has made a Fool of Art. Cap. Methinks the Sky wears a more gaudy Dress Than her old glistering Garniture of Stars; There is some mighty Revel sure above Stairs: Hark how they stamp, as if they were Dancing Jigs! Ax. How dare you make such Comments on these Wonders? Cap. Faith, Innocence is fearless, as 'tis free; Tho the Frame crack, the Splinters shall not fright me. Shou'd the great Gods, that toss these Fiery Orbs Like Tennis-balls for Heav'nly recreation, Let slip some weighty Globe through careless Fingers, Upon this Head; the Accident's prepar'd for. Ax. Well said, brave youth, if with respect to Heav'n. Ha! what means this? A bloody Hand, and Writing! Cap. Scriveners in Heav'n! then there's some hopes for Usurers. Ax. The hand of Heav'n is drawing some Indentures, Altering Estates in the poor under-World. Of all the sights, this does perplex me most. Pray, Sir, your Judgement: 'Tis an Ancient Hand, I cannot read. Astro. No wonder, Sir; 't has not been us'd In China these ten Thousand years. Ax. Noble tradition! Astro. But the Words are these, Kiungsi Honan; Which is Interpreted, Death, Division. Some Great Man dyes, and leaves his vast Dominions To dubious Heirs. Ax. Nothing more likely, Sir; He that grasps more than's Handful, loses all. A lucky Guess turns to a Prophesie. Enter Tamerlane. Tam. I've urg'd to have my Sentence chang'd in vain, Told her the Truth; But why shou'd she believe me? Shou'd the Sun change his Course, men might suspect The Day-light. The Pole Star, if unfix'd, absolves the Sailor From farther Faith. Oh, the vile Rogue Ragalzan! Ha! what a glorious Night after the Storm! I think a Comet, and an Arm from Heav'n! Come, Vengeance, come; 'tis time that thou wert come; Welcom, dear Comet, welcom bloody Paw: Cou'd I but reach thee, I'de shake hands with thee. Why all this noise, and ne'r a flaming Dart To fix me dead? I thought the Gods durst strike When they did threaten. Was there ever Mortal That more abus'd their Favors, study'd Acts More vile, to rouse up Heavenly Indignation? By your Immortal Selves; if you neglect Your Office, I will snatch away Revenge, The Jewel of your Crown, and put an end With my own hands to this Inglorious Life. Ire. Strange Sights i'th'Air, they say, foretel great Changes: What, will these Rebels never make an end? Good Father, stay at home, and tell the stories Of your great Deeds, to your admiring Friends; But go to Wars no more: Leave off a winning Gamester. One day, you take a Town, and make a Governour; The next, you win a Country, make a King: These pay some little Chief-rent to their Lord, Enjoy the rest themselves. You take from some, And give it back to others. Why might not less Than all the World serve one Man's turn? Tam. How wisely thou dost weigh the Trifles of the World! Ire. And now you sigh, the Earth lies heavy on you: Conquer no more; or let the weighty Ball. Roll off, as it came on. Tam. Oh, my Irene! 'Tis thou dost cause my grief, my dear disturber. Ire. Alas! wherein have I offended you? Perhaps, my want of Duty was the cause; But sure I meant it not. If to rejoyce at all your Victories; If to fall out, with all that lessen you; If to dissolve in Tears, when you're not well, Or have your Peace disturb'd with Martial Cares: If to fall into Swoons when you'r in danger, Be not to love you; then I love you not. [Weeps. Tam. Ah, cruel Girl, begon, I cannot bear thee, For every look from thee strikes Death into me: How much more happy art thou now, than I! Short-sighted Innocence! thou hast no Prospect Of this thy Danger; the sad thought of which Racks my poor Soul, and cuts me up alive, And tears my Bowels out before my Face! Ire. Good Sir, what moves you to this Fatal sadness? Tam. Ah! were it fit that thou shoul'dst know my Sorrows, Yet Children should not know their Parents Shame. Ire. I know your Troubles, and have hear'd your Vow, And I can satisfie your nicest Scruples: Heav'n be my Witness, I Had rather go to death, to give you ease, Than to th'Embraces of a dear-lov'd Hero, Whose Wit cou'd charm, whose Valor cou'd secure me, Whose Beauty cou'd inflame my frozen Brest; Rather than to my Nuptials with Axalla. My resignation will be your discharge To Heav'n, and Earth: Injuries are Rewards When they are begg'd for. Tam. Greater then wou'd be Thy kindness, and my shame, shou'd I desert thee. Ire. But, Sir, consider how the World's Amaz'd, And Nature's frighted, to see you disorder'd: Do we not blow up worthless Cottages, To save contiguous Pallaces, from bold And disrespectful Flames? And shall the World want Order, and direction From your great Soul, if mine can stop its passage To other Orbs, and make the Earth my Debtor? Tam. So young, so wise! Why sure thou art Inspir'd; Thy Soul's upon the Wing, and sees much farther, Than the unfledg'd Companions of her years, Ill Omen of thy Fate: Thy Soul's too ripe To stay long in the Shell. Oh, now I fear. Ire. What if I might have liv'd some harmless years Of Ignorance, and Youth? Yet if you please To pluck off this green Fruit (I will not say Untimely, when you call for't) to content Some longing Palate, 'Twill not be harsh to me, if not to you. You gave me Life, and 'tis but to restore it, To pay a debt which you contracted for me; Let me be just to Nature, if not you. Tam. No more, no more, sweet merciful Redeemer: Why art thou come, to scrue up my Afflictions? Oh, every Word from thee, against thy self, Does wound my Soul, more than ten Thousand Daggers. Dear, cruel Orator, why dost thou plead Against the Innocent, to save the Guilty? He that does spare my life's the worst of Murderers; And thou deserv'st to dye, by speaking for me: I cannot bear thy sinful Eloquence; Let not so sweet an Angel plead for Satan. Oh, leave me to the Furies: they're my Council. [Exeunt. Re-enter Tamerlane, with Axalla. Tam. In what condition is the Enemy? Ax. Now you speak like your self, a watchful Monarch. Tam. May not Prince Zeylan once again surprize us, Before the general Assault be given? Ax. He may; Sir; but I have intrench'd the Army With greater safety, doubled all the Guards About your Sacred Person. Tam. Wondrous well. But then give order strait to all the Rounds To keep a stricter Watch, that whosoever Dares stir abroad to hight, be shot at without mercy; And let it be proclaim'd without delays: Secureness, more than Cowardise, betrays. [Exit. Ax. And yet, pray Heav'n he meditate no mischief In mighty Souls Passion's not soon supprest: Like wounded Whales, they struggle till they dye; By their impatience they increase the smart, Provoke their Pains, and vex a harmless Dart, Tossing the mighty Mass till they're on ground, Their rage more fatal, than the little Wound.

Slave to my Passions, Scandal to my self, Here stand the Ruines of great Tamerlane, Right reverend Remains! Fine mouldring Statue! Poor Thunder-blasted Oak; sometime the Glory, now The just reproach of all the neighb'ring Shrubs. Fine Quirk, to salve the Conscience, to let others kill me! Well, 'tis all one, as if I kill'd my self: And that's no harm, since I'm no more myself: The Magistrate in me destroys the Malefactor; And this form pleases best, a comlier shape Of Death. Ax. 'Tis as I guess'd; I know 'tis he, by his Majestic Meen, His piercing Eyes that use to strike men speechless; Tho Suns are Clouded, yet the Day-light shows When they're ascended in our Hemisphere. Ire. Oh Heav'ns! It is the Emperor: I'll go to him. Ax. Oh, by no means, I've told the Guards already. Enter Zeylan disguiz'd. Zey. I hope 'tis not too late, tho time is precious, Now my Philarmia's acting her last part; My Trumpet saw her led away to Judgement, By this time she's condemned, perhaps led out To Execution: yet if it were so, How comes the World to be no more disorder'd, No Earthquake, no Eclips, Convulsion, Blindness? Can Nature keep an equal Pulse, or have A healthful look in such an Agony, When she that is the Life of Nature's dying? Ah, poor Philarmia! must thou lose thy Life For sparing mine? Unhappy headstrong Girl! Well, thus far I have got into their Camp With this Disguise: I'll find some other means To see this high and mighty God-like Man, And with this Dagger search his haughty Heart, And try if it be mortal; so prevent Her Death by the Confusion, tho I lose My Life to do't, or perish all together. Tam. All my Commands are lost, ther's none will shoot: I, whom so many Millions late obey'd, Am slighted, scorn'd. Have I no Friend, nor Foe, To put a stop to my declining Honor? 'Tis hard. Rogues, Traitors, fawning Slaves To the Coward Tamerlane: Now I cou'd wish For raging Bajazet, to be my Orator. 1 Sold. 'Tis the Emperor, as the General told us. 2. Sold. My Life, 'tis he by's Voice; Camrade, my Powder's wet. 3. Sold. And my hand shakes, I cannot hold my Arms Tam. What, Am I yet contemned? Slaves, Cowards, Dogs, Whom do you guard here, wandring Tamerlane, That Renegade, Cut-throat, glorious Thief, Whom Fortune meant the Gallows, gave the Throne to? Zey. What a bold Fellow's this, that rails against His Prince, and no man shoots him? sure 'tis some Discontented Votary of China that contemns The Conqueror's Laws. This Fellow may assist me in my design. (Goes up to Tam.) Tam. Ha! a Spy o'th'Enemy's! Zey. Methinks, I see Some discontent writ on thy brow: Art thou So weary of thy Life, to rail upon The Emperor to his Guards? Tam. I, that I am: And I would have him kill'd. Zey. And so wou'd I, For stronger Reasons, cou'd I pass his Guards. Tam. Merciful Providence that brought thee hither, My dear chance Friend! I will assist thee in thy brave design, And bring thee where he is. But, since thou'rt in A killing mood, thou shalt kill me: not that I love him dearer than I do my self; But 'tis more Charity to kill a Man prepar'd, To ease a Wretch opprest, And groaning under Loads of weighty Sorrows. Zey. Why shou'd I kill an Innocent that ne'r provok'd me? Tam. Alass, I'm not so harmless; I have done many vile and barbarous Murders, Committed Sacrilege, unpeopled Cities: Here stands the Man, that has destroy'd more of Mankind, than ever Mortal did, since the Creation. Zey. Alass, poor Frantick Wretch! Tam. Mistake me not, I've been a General, And am guilty of all Crimes, committed By my Command: Then, if a man deserves To dye for single Murders, can the greater Number excuse him? Men Duel for Revenge, A hasty piece of Justice, and do freely Exchange each others Lives, which each man has a right to: We murder Thousands that did ne'r provoke us With wrongful Deed, or Sharper Contumelies. Zey. In that thou hast some Reason. Tam. Nay, lately I have done the most abhorr'd And Hellish Act, that History e'r spoke of: I have condemn'd a guiltless Person, twice Has sav'd my Life, only to please my Lust. Don't I deserve Damnation? May not I Obtain from thy kind Hand, that longs to do Some great Heroic mischief, The lovely Death-stroke? Zey. Alass, I pity thee; And have no cognizance of these thy Crimes, Half wash'd away by Penitence. Tam. Well then, Suppose that I was Tamerlane; wou'dst thou not kill me? Zey. I, that I wou'd, with much more eager hast Than quench my thirst with Nectar, or my Love With Venus, or with Helen, or with her Whom above all my longing Soul holds dearest; Lov'd at first sight, and never after chang'd. Tam. I see 'tis Love that makes us Madmen all. Then I am Tamerlane, the Terror of the World. Zey. Rather it's Scorn, or Pity. Alass, poor Madman! Wrought up by idle Fumes t'affect to dye For such a Mighty Monarch. Tam. I tell thee, I Am he; the Wrath of Heav'n, the Scourge of Mortals: 'Tis I that have enslav'd thy native Soil, My Sword has Widow'd half the Universe, Turn'd the World wrongside outwards, in the toss Broke all the brittle Laws, that e'r Mankind Compos'd, their paltry Earthen Wares of Justice: And all for Glory, damn'd eternal Fame. Take thy Revenge. Zey. Vain madman, hold thy Peace. Tam. Why then, by Mahomet, I am. Zey. Falsly Thou swear'st by thy false Prophet, who can take No vengeance for thy Perjury, nor hears it: Nor will I e'r believe thee. Tam. aside. Double Infidel: It is impossible here to convince him Well, well, I long to dye, 'cause Life's a burthen; But if I show thee Tamerlane, in all His glory, compass'd in with Guards, and circled With prostrate Princes in his bright Pavilion, And like the mid-day Sun with all his Rayes about him, And after find out means to have him single, And then a way for thee t'escape when thou Hast kill'd him: Will that merit Thanks, or Friendship? Zey. Why, now thou speak'st: and cou'dst thou make it good, Were I the greatest Man that trod on Earth, And with my hand cou'd reach the spangled Spheres, And distribute mens Fortunes with their Stars; I wou'd Depose my self, to be thy Slave, And lick the Dust before thee. Tam. If I betray thee, Heav'n revenge the Falshood. Zey. Come then, my Perjur'd Madman, I will trust thee, And thou shalt Steer me in this unknown Coast; For what have I to save, Philarmia lost? [Exeunt. Enter Ragalzan, Despina. Rag. This was a rare request, a Master-piece of Malice: There's nothing but a Woman cou'd have thought on't. How cou'd you work him to this height? Desp. With ease: Lovers will wind themselves by Words to Passion, Their Airy talk turns Fire by agitation: Thus, sometimes yielding, sometimes aggravating, 'Twixt Hope and Fear, like Ships betray'd by Calms To greater Storms; I then extorted from him Such monstrous Oaths, such wild and Impious offers, The Gods might be asham'd to be so Hector'd. Rag. Oh, good, good, good! But did not he deny What he affirm'd, as soon as he had heard Your admirable Suit? Desp. Oh, yes, most fiercely. But cou'd I think such mean things of a Hero, A double CÅsar, triple Alexander? And you had told me all the Truth before. Rag. It was too true. How cou'd he be secure Had Bajazet escap'd? The Turkish Garrisons Had all revolted. But I've found a way To make him constant to his Vow, and swallow't glibly. The Mufti's here, and the Dervises too, About Petitions from their several Churches. The Mufti's supler than a new oyl'd Tumbler, When you have greas'd his Fist: give him a colour, To make things doubtful, then throw Dice for Justice. They all shall find it Lawful, and require him To offer up his Daughter. Desp. That's enough: Let me alone to give the fatal Period. But how does he digest this Compound Passion? Rag. I come not near him; but he raves Divinely: Love and Ambition fiercely fight within him; When Nature steps to part them, both fall on him: Love pities her at last, and takes her part, Then both go to't again, and fight for ever; Those Mastiffs are too keen to loose their hold. Desp. Oh, thou refreshest me with cheerful Sounds, With all the Music of sublime Revenge! Oh, thou hast given me Spirit of Joy to drink! Rag. Nay, then take t'other Dram. His pretty Daughter Came to him since, and with her Innocent Prate Has so betwich'd him, that he went out strait And told his Passion to the gaping Army: And wou'd have kill'd himself, if not prevented. Desp. I wou'd have hindred him: I wou'd not have him dye so unprepar'd His Life and Fame shall perish both together. Rag. But yet some easier way might have been found. Desp. This is the nobler method. I'll wound him in his Fame, his tender'st part, To which his Life has ever been a Drudge, And run of errands over all the World: I'll make the angry Lyon scourge himself With his own Tail; and then give him his Fate As certain, as unlook'd for. When he has offer'd up his bloody Victim To my great Shrine, his dear and dutiful Irene, The Saviour of his Life, Age's Supporter; Abhor'd by all his Friends, by's Foes contemn'd, Deserted by Mankind, by Heav'n rejected, Then let him dye with all his Shames about him. Petty Revengess, are for Petty Crimes; And pardon me, great Soul of Bajazet, If th'Earth afford no greater an Atonement For thy dear Blood. Pray give me an account of all proceedings, That we may feast our selves on his Afflictions. Rag. I Will not lose my share of the least morsel. [Exeunt. Tamerlane in his Pavilion: Princes and Servants about him. Tam. giving a Ring to one of his Guards. Go tell the Countryman, that sits without At the Pavilion Gate, that by this Token, The man that left him there, desires him to Come In: not a word more, upon your duty. [Exit Guard. Now is the time, to put a period to This languishing Distemper, flattering Fever, This merry Madness, this Apulian Sting, That makes men rage in measures: now I'le shake off This rude Companion, Love, that blinds Men first, Then gives them blows in jest, that smart in earnest. Enter Guard, with Zeylan disguis'd. Zey. Am I betray'd, or no? Here stands the Prince; But where's my Guide, I know not! 'Tis no matter, I'll make a bold Attack, and lose my Life in't. Tam. Let all withdraw, and leave me with this Stranger. Come, Friend, draw nearer, view me more exactly, And tell me, if your Partner in Affliction Has kept his Word. Am I forsworn, or no? Am not I Tamerlane? Zey. Death, 'tis the same; Shining in all his Glory! What means this Riddle? Tam. Nay, fear not to come near me. Zey. 'Tis not Fear, but Wonder. Tam. Here, take this Dagger, strike this open Brest; But yet, before you do this welcom Act, Here is the Door you must escape at, to The River's side; where lies a Boat prepar'd to take in the next Comer, which will strait Row you to Zeylan's Citadel, before The Deed be known: and here's a Cabinet Not very weighty, but worth many Millions, The Spoils of Turky, Persia, Ãgypt, China, Muscovy, Syria, Afric, Indostan; If thou get'st clear from hence, thou hast enough To purchase thee a Kingdom. Zey. Sure Fame has Not flatter'd him: he's a Man of wondrous Virtue! But Thrones are not exempt from fatal Sorrows. Can I consent to kill my Benefactor? Tam. There's nothing thou canst do, that can deserve So great Rewards, but this. Alass! I'm weary Of Life, my Empire is too great a Burden, Without the over-weight of private Griefs: I never yet refus'd the thing was ask'd me, Nor ever sent a sad Man from my presence; And shall I be deny'd so small, so just a Favor? Zey. My Vengeance fails me. Most Heroic Prince, I cannot guide this Dagger to your Brest; I beg but one Request, in satisfaction Of all the Wrongs, the World, or you have done me. Tam. Refuse not this to me, and I'll refuse thee Nothing, that my unbounded Empire yields. Zey. Here on my knees I'll try your Virtue first: I beg, Sir, a young Beardless Captain's Life, That is condemn'd to dye, for letting Zeylan Escape, that was his Prisoner. Tam. I grant it freely. Zey. Why, then as freely here I give you Zeylan, [pulls off his disguise. With all my Forces, all my Reputation Acquir'd in Arms, and lye still at your Mercy; But, know the weighty Reason: she's my Mistress In that disguise. No smothering Revenge, Nor over-looking Envy, nor vile Treason, Mov'd me to this; but her dear Life endanger'd Urg'd me to undertake your Death, my own, The ruine of the World, that my fair Saint Might fly out in the merciful Confusion. Tam. But art thou Zeylan? Welcom noble Prince, [Embraces him. Prop to thy falling Country, China's Redeemer! Can there be so much Virtue in the World? And Love the Cause, dire Love, that monstrous Passion? 'Tis I that am thy Prisoner: here I yield thee My Sword, with all its Conquests, all its Glories, With more serene, and unconcern'd a Freedom Than Virgins do their Beauties, Saints their Souls, To Heaven, or Hymen: but be sure thou give me No Quarter; take my Life; for if thou spare it, Perhaps I may resume the rest. Thou art The fittest Man to execute this Sacred Act: Oh, now 'tis Justice, that before was Fury. Zey. Pray, Sir, be pleased to call first to your Guards; Her precious Life's at Stake. Tam. Guards, make hast; Carry my Pardon to the sentenc'd Captain That let Prince Zeylan scape. Now, Sir, To my Request: be speedy, and begon With all your Treasure, lest the Soldiers Fury O'rwhelm you. Come, ease me quickly. Zey. I have not, Sir, been bred in Foreign Courts, Nor can I talk of high-flown Rules of Honor, Those nice distinctions, fram'd in Virtue's School; But I have some rude Sparks of Nature, show me, By their dim light, How great a Monster is Ingratitude. Tam. Thou art ungrateful then, if thou deny me this So just Request, since I have answer'd thine: Death is to me a greater Gift, than Life Is to thy Mistress. Is there a greater good Than to be lull'd asleep from endless griefs, And wake no more to find 'em? Thou art unjust too to thy Native Country; Nor canst thou answer this to Heav'n, or Earth: Nor will the Ghosts of all thy slaughter'd Friends Let thee sleep quiet, till they are Reveng'd; They'l haunt thee, tear thee in ten Thousand pieces, And send a Sampler of thee to each Corner Of the wide mischief-studying Earth, to teach The World the Fate of Traytors to their Country. Zey. I never heard Great. Tamerlane abus'd Heav'ns favors to Excess; but his well-temper'd Sword Still carv'd out work for his diffusive Mercy; The petty Wranglers of the Universe Chose rather to submit to his Just Sceptre, Than to subdue each other: Shall I deprive the World of all its Lustre, The Ornament of Story, Task of Fame, Extinguish the great Light graces and guides it, And by your Glory raise my Infamy? Urge me not to a Crime your self would fly from. Tam. Is there such Honor in the World besides? How many Climates have I pass'd, and now At last have found it in this Savage Corner? Sure 'tis instill'd by Nature, not by Precept. 'Tis time to dye now, for a weighty Reason: Thou hast out-done me in my own Pretensions, And rais'd the price of Honor to that rate, 'Twou'd ruine me, and all my Conquer'd Earth To rise to the vast Purchase. Oh, the Mark's too high For me to reach; I'll quit the Field In Virtue, and return to Tyranny: Kill me, or else thy Mistress dyes. Zey. kneeling. The Gods forbid. Oh, look upon her first, and she will melt you: You cannot hurt so sweet an Innocence. I know you cannot, Nature will not bear it: She'l smile away your Anger; or she'l thaw Your frozen heart t'a Torrent, with her Tears. She is the Joy of Nature, Pride of Heav'n, The Idol of all Eyes that e'r beheld her: Tygers wou'd lose their fierceness at her sight, And can Mankind hold Weapons to destroy her? Oh, save her, save her, save her, Virtuous Prince, And let my Life redeem her. Tam. Rise, brave Friend. No; both shall live together, and live happy: I take delight in the content of all men, Less dear than thee, tho I have none my Self. Well, I'll not press thee 'gainst the sense of Honor, And Nature too: I know too well the weight They bear, in well-born Souls. A Thousand ways There are, to the great Joy that thou deny'st me: I'll wait a little longer, spread my Sails To the next Wind, to waft me to my Port, Where I will Anchor, and Lanch out no more. But, to return th'Heroic Resignation, I make thee King of China. Zey. Vice-Roy rather, When I have Conquer'd the remaining Rebels. Tam. Then, by my last Will I bequeath it Thee; My death shall soon confirm it. Let's go out, And strait declare it to the wondring Army. The World's my own: let's leave it in full Light; That Sun makes no fair Day, that sets not Bright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Tamerlane on a Couch asleep. SONG. Reason and Time had once agreed, My Heart from Loving shou'd be freed; But Cupid swore, he'd lay a Snare Shou'd catch my Reason, Time repair. Sylvia appear'd with all the Charms And Witchcrafts of a Face, Able to do all Mankind harms, And Womankind disgrace: Reason strait fled, Time wou'd have stay'd, Mistaking for the Sun, The glories of the brighter Maid, By those his course to run. Jove saw, and fear'd some strange surprise, Lest all the World shou'd be Immortal made by her bright Eyes, And Scorn his Deity: So Time was forc'd to fly, old Age remain; But, Ah! poor Reason ne'r came back again. Enter in Dumb-show, Time with his Hour-glass, The ParcÅ, Death, speckled Fame drawn in a Chariot by Cerberus, follow'd by Furies and Infernal Spirits. Scene opens, and discovers Mount Atlas, with a Face and Beard like a Man made by Trees, which sinks down by degrees with soft Music; and at the top of him appear Angels with flaming Swords, and the Fiends begin to withdraw. 1 Ang. Be gone, Infernal Spirits; leave this Hero, Whose Virtues none of Human Race e'r equal'd. Be calm, Great Monarch: Let no Fiends molest, With frightful Dreams, thy too afflicted Brest. No mortal Beauty does deserve thy Passion; A brighter Object claims thy Admiration: Thou hast a Share in thy Creator's Love, Thy Soul, thy Fame, are both secure above. Tam. Where have I been, in Hell and Heav'n at once? Was this a Dream? Or did I waking see? My Senses were not lock't, sure: Had the doors Been shut, such Visions never cou'd have enter'd. At first, 'twas horrid; after, most Serene: Oh, let me ever tast such Tranquil Joys As this last moment Heav'n infus'd into me! What need I care how near I am the Haven, If I must land in Bliss? Enter Guard. Guard. Ragalzan begs admittance to your Presence. Tam. How dares the cause of all my Woes come near me? He will disturb my Thoughts again: no matter; Why shou'd I hope for Peace? Enter Ragalzan. Villain, what hast thou done? Thou hast betray'd me, And brought me to the Suburbs of Damnation: I'm on the top of Ãtna, scorch'd already With all the Sulphurous Flames, and Hellish Vapors That Pride, and Lust, and dire Ingratitude, With all the black Ingredients that are boiling Within that baleful Furnace, can cast up; And still thy treacherous Counsels push me forwards Into the dreadful Gulph. Traytor, be sure Thou bring me off this Rock, and place me once again Into the tranquil Plains of cheerful Peace, And unreproaching Conscience; or, by the Justice Of all those watchful Powers that threaten my destruction, I'll bury thee alive, and cover thee with Kingdoms, That thou shalt never see the Light again. Rag. Good Sir, have Patience: here I come with Cordials, And you reproach my Zeal. Was I the cause Of your great Passion? but did strive to ease you With proper Remedies: A civil Rape, Which Women count the highest Obligation, And does at once serve to excuse both Parties. If by rash Oaths you put your self in Streights, 'Twas not my fault. Besides, I think you need not fear th'event; Shee will release your Vow, for less than half the World; which in your Prodigal Love-talk You laid down at her Feet. Tam. Oh, I have try'd her, And told her, I was guiltless of his death; Yet she persists deaf, and inexorable, As Adders sung to; as unmov'd, as Rocks To th'Importunities of Winds and Waves. Rag. 'Tis but to try the temper of your Passion, A Stale device, the Womens common place Book. But I have found a Salvo to your Conscience, Which all the great Divines o'th'Universe, Tho diff'ring in all other Points, approve of: Why, Sir, your dreadful Vow extends no farther Than to the Princess's delivery; You may secure her from all further danger. Tam. Ha! say'st thou so? I thought of this before; But weigh'd it not so throughly. Rag. More than this; Because you love variety of Faiths, I have enquir'd the opinion of the Mufftee, The Calif, Patriarch of Antioch, and brought A Writing here under their Hands and Seals. Tam. Oh, let me see those Heav'nly Lines. Rag. Look to that Paragraph. Tam. reads. An unjust Vow is better broke than kept: This Vow is not unjust, nor needs be broke; For tho the intent of the Demander might Extend to free disposal of her Person To Death, or long Captivity; yet since 'Tis not exprest, the Emperor's oblig'd No farther than to literal performance, And all means may be used to save her harmless Person. Rag. Is not this Sence? Tam. Reason peeps out again, O'rcast with Shame and Passion: Thanks, dear Friend. Oh, thou hast scatter'd Life through my dead Veins, And pour'd such Flouds of Joy into my bosom, The sudden Heav'nly Showrs will cause an Inundation! Oh, how my wrinkled heart, shrunk up with Sorrows, Dilates it self, to let the ruddy Rivers Have their free course throw all the Azure Channels! Go, tell Despina she shall be obey'd, (To the Guard.) I'll see it done my self: then bring my Daughter (Since it must be so) bound; but hark you, Friends, Guard her, as you wou'd do your Lives, or, more than yours, My own: Let no bold Sacrilegious hand Dare to profane the Temple of all Virtues; By Heav'n, he dyes, that suffers any hand To touch that Holy Maid. Oh, I'm asham'd, That such a blot shou'd rest upon my Glory; But Heav'n must be obey'd, tho to my blushes. Bring her, I say; But then besure you suffer none to touch her, Or, by the Price of all my Conquer'd Globe, Which is not worth one hair of her bright Head, I'll crumble you to dust, and blow you round The mournful Universe; which I'll hang round with black, If her dear Life's invaded; if she dyes, And leaves me not an Heir to rule the World, I'll Massacre Mankind, and root out all That race of busie intellectual Monsters, Half Angels, and half Brutes, and worse than either: Or turn them all to Eunuchs, who shall howl In pious Dirges for her hovering Soul, Till it is fixt in foremost ranks of Glory, Weep out their Lives, and leave the empty World. Alarm without, Trumpet and Drums. Enter Axalla, with Captains. Ax. Sir, your Triumphant Arms have crush'd the Rebels: China, and all the World is now your own. Tam. Oh, my Axalla, oh, there was a time I cou'd have heard such Sounds with raging Joys; But now it comes too late: Give blind men Beauty, Musick to the deaf, Give Prosperous Winds to Ships that have no Sails; Their Joys will be like mine. Ax. What, not in temper yet, Sir? I must acquaint you with a just occasion, To intermix some sorrows with your Joys: The Noble Zeylan and Philarmia's slain, Whose Gratitude to you, love to each other Wou'd not excuse 'em from this dangerous Action. Tam. Then Honor's out of fashion, Tears in Tune. Alass, poor Rival in that lofty Science, Ther's no man left alive that can keep up That Beautiful Contention: I've out-liv'd it. Tell me how that Heroic Pair expir'd. Ax. The Rebels were dispers'd, their Leaders taken, Yet rash Philarmia follow'd the pursuit, Tho rescu'd twice by Zeylan, we retreated; But anxious Zeylan went back to secure her, And in a Skirmish with the flying Rebels Receiv'd a dangerous Wound: which caus'd a Rumor Through all the Camp that he was slain. At last, Philarmia comes Victorious, hears the news; Then strait like Lightning, Arm'd with bright Destruction, Flew in the thickest Troops, and flash'd, and Shin'd, Struck dead whole Ranks before her; till she was Extinguish'd by some Envious hand that drew Death's dismal Curtain o'r her Glorious Face: Zeylan comes back, and missing her, tho faint, And bloody, Lanches out again, and finds A crimson heap of newly slaughter'd Bodies, Their Souls yet flutt'ring o'r their ruin'd Mansions: And there too soon he spy'd A Diamond in the Dust, sparkling Philarmia Pale, and yet glimmering, in the Shades of Death; Then strait tears up his Wounds, and with his Dagger probes 'em, Till he falls dead upon her. Tam. Happy Pair! Enter Despina. Ax. What, Love affairs yet! Friends, let us retire. [Exit with Soldiers. Tam. Here comes the sole Disturber of my peaceful Thoughts. Desp. Thanks, most indulgent Conqueror: Now I find There are some Monarchs that do own the Gods, That unrestrained Power, allay'd With Piety, can bound it self like th'Ocean, Whose uphil Waves hang o'r the threat'ned Earth; Might overflow its humble Friend, but will not. Trumpets, and Cornets; the Procession enters, Virgins in Mourning. Tam. So, so; here comes the Stateliest piece of Shame That ever Monarch groan'd for: Now I feel Honor and Piety return again. I'll keep my purpose Close to Religion, Laws, to Heav'n, to Nature. Irene is brought in like Sacrifice. Drest like a Sacrifice! Ah, poor Irene, Art thou prepar'd then for a sudden Fate? Ire. A sudden Fate! There's no such thing in Nature: We're dying from our Cradles: Heav'n can send No greater Mercy, when't has predispos'd Men for the Blessing. Re-enter Axalla. Ha! what Pageant's this? Great Gods, can this be true? or do I see A Lover's Oath, an over-acted Rant, A Fugitive Word, that has out-run a Thought Forc'd by the violence of self-urging Passion, Which the Gods laugh at, other men despise, And scatter to the Wind; become so sacred, So indispensible, that she must dye for't? Nay, she by whom thou Liv'st, thy Angel, thy Redemer? Are there such things as Gods? Or are they over-busy'd? Or is the World become so rankly Wicked Ne'r a spare Thunderbolt is left for Thee? Tam. Oh, spare me, spare me; let me dye Axalla. Ax. Canst thou devote that Life, that sav'd thy own? See that Blood spilt, that sprung from thy own Fountain; And kept thy own from shedding? Canst thou hear Her dying Groans, by whose sweet Prayers the Heav'ns Have been inclin'd to thy Success, and softned to Thy Failings? By whose dear Murmurs, and Celestial Sounds Thy Life has been refresh'd more than by Glory? Whose Tears wou'd melt the Earth into an Ocean, Whose Sighs wou'd cleave an Universe of Adamants, And make a Palsy shake the guilty Earth To Shreds, to Atoms, to a Second Chaos, Tho it were Crampt with Unrelenting Irons; And Hearts, as hard as thine. Tam. Axalla, Oh Axalla, cou'dst thou see My Heart, thou woud'st not chide, but pity me: Here stands a Saint, and there methinks an Angel Peeps from the Clouds, to call me to performance Of Sacred Vows. Is Heaven divided Against it self, and shall frail Man be constant! Nay, more than that; I'm satisfi'd by all The Oracles of Heav'n, the Mystic Priests Of several Churches, that my Vow's perform'd In her delivery: But, oh! I've done too much. Desp. Ha! is't come to this? [Aside. Ax. Too much indeed, and more than Heav'n requires: What 'tis a Sin to keep, 's no Sin to break. Fy, Sir; for shame grasp your loese Thoughts together, Bind up your shatter'd Soul, that it may piece again, And Grow the stronger by this Amorous Fracture: Oh, let me never live, to see The Glory of all Ages basely bury'd Thus in a Woman's Arms. Desp. Sir, I percieve I breed a Faction in your Family; Your Slaves are angry, and you must obey: Unbind the Princess; but unlose me too From my rash Contract; 'Tis better for us both. Tam. No, Fairest, no: Let me not lose that Heav'n, after assurance. Think of some Nobler, less afflicting Tryal, Some desperate, never yet attempted Action, Nor ever thought of: Bid me drain the Ocean, Make Mountains Navigable, transplant a Climate, Unhindge the Globe; Bid me obscure the Sun; Name that impossible that shan't be done: But urge me not to tear out my own Bowels, To be alive Dissected, doubly Martyr'd. Desp. Are Vows made only to be broke; and Women The Stales, to cheat the Gods by? Is this your Love? That I must keep my Word, and you be free: I'll try if I shall be obey'd: Strangle the Princess. Ax. kneeling. Hold, Madam, hold: Here, take my guilty Head: 'Twas I that councel'd Bajazet's Destruction, Contriv'd the Murder, urg'd the doubtful Prince. Cou'd her soft Heart contrive so harsh a Deed? Her Pious Soul consent to such black Crimes? Cou'd she the fatal Laws of Empire know, The hard necessities of Jealous Greatness? Let me, the Author, expiate the Crime: Let not this spotless Lamb redeem a Tyger, Deep in your Husband's Blood. Desp. You are her Lover; Then I must punish you, and set her free. Ire. Oh, Madam, hear him not: his cruel Love Betrays his Life, but never will save mine; For sure, I neither can, nor will out-live him. Ah, generous Innocent! why wilt thou rob me Of Martyrdom, in such a Glorious Cause, To save my Father's Life, and ease his Sorrows, That weigh too heavy on the afflicted World. Desp. What Game of Glory's this; where Death's the Prize, And Life the odious Blank? When Appetites Are too irregular, pity they shou'd be humour'd. Tam. He wrongs himself to save his guiltless Mistress: No Truth is half so Holy, as this Falsehood. Despair urg'd Bajazet to self-Destruction; Heav'n be my Judge, 'twas no Command of mine, Nor yet their Counsel, to substract one minute From his Heroic Life. Desp. So you have told me, Sir; and I begin To think you real: well, 'tis time The Vail were off, lest Passion work some mischief. Forgive me, mighty Sir, this bold Request, [kneeling. 'Twas but to try the firmness of your Love: You have discharg'd your Promise to the utmost, And put upon the Rack your own indulgent Nature. Sir, cou'd you think this was the way to win you, And make my self the Empress of the World; To come to your Majestick bed, all reeking In your dear Daughters Blood? I'm satisfy'd You never order'd Bajazets Destruction, As you convinc'd me since. Tam. 'Tis a Sacred Truth; No more, than by hard usage, and denying To him the sight of you, which was his Life. Desp. That well might move me, Sir, but not so highly. Tam. I had your temper show'd me in false Glasses, Which made me Amorously own in part What you believ'd by many weighty Reasons. Ax. This may end well: I've seldom heard of Women Stand upon terms with all-commanding Emperors. Rag. If these two piece again, what will become Of me, the Engineer? I shall be crush'd 'Twixt these two mighty Wheels, that I have put In motion. Perhaps, the Emperor is not poyson'd: Who knows the walks of wily Womankind? Desp. Now, Sir, by Virtue of your former Grant, I'll add but one request, you'l not deny me: 'Tis to release your admirable Daughter, And beg the Friendship of the fair Irene. Tam. Now you revive me, Madam; all my Sorrows Vanish like Dreams, or like the gloomy Shades, They steal away insensibly from Day-light: And unperceiv'd, like well-bred Courtiers, slide Out of their Prince's Presence. Oh, how my Heart's Enlarg'd! the spacious Room left open For Aery, lightsom thoughts, there's nothing left That can disturb my Peace. Strike off her Chains, And bring her to the Empress. Ax. The Gods forbid: What, give her Sacred Life Into the hands of one that Vows her Death! Trust not to cover'd Flames, nor Furies reconcil'd. Tam. Ha! hold a little. (To the Guards.) Desp. Am I suspected? Then my Faith's discharg'd, And my Revenge, chain'd up by unjust Pity, Breaks loose again; my darling, dear Revenge, And rages for its Prey. Perform your Vow, Great Sir. Ax. Oh, hear a little! May you not accept A meaner Offering for this mighty Princess; As Deities of old took worthless Brutes To save Heroic Lives; and give the Emperor A full discharge of his rash Vow? Desp. If either of you dye, Heav'n be my Witness I freely clear the Emperor of his Vow. The other dyes of Grief by course. [Aside. Ax. One, Life, to save a better, 'tis no Crime, But an exchange, to the advantage of All the surviving World: Then thus, Sir, I absolve you. [Stabs himself. Guard her dear Life, or let just Vengeance shake Your Guilty Throne. Tam. Oh desperate Fondness! Ire. Oh Heavens! Irene swoons. Tam. and Ragal. run to her. Tam. What ails Irene? Ire. Nothing but Dying. Rag. Sure 'tis not Grief alone; I fear she's Poyson'd, By some corrupted Servant: and I've heard Some mutt'ring on't. Tam. Hast thou indeed? Rag. But here I have a Cordial-Antidote, will expel Both Grief, and Poyson too. Tam. Give it her quickly. (Ragal. gives it her.) Ha! She revives. Rag. to Desp. But she'l as soon relapse: I've poyson'd her, without that State and Pomp, Which I knew wou'd not take. Desp. What needed that rash hast? Rag. Ha! She relents, and longs to be our Soveraign; But I'le secure her, For fear of squeamish penitential Tales: Then say, 'twas Justice for my murder'd Friend. Goes to Ax. &amp; embraces him. Ah, my poor dying Friend! dear fellow Soldier! Have we out-liv'd all dangers from our Foes, To dye thus tamely? Sir, can you bear these wrongs? Just Heav'ns, I cannot. False Murdress! [Stabs Despina. Desp. What thou, Ragalzan! Oh, thou double Traytor! Didst not thou blow the Coals of my revenge, Accuse them all of Bajazet's Destruction? Tam. Guards, seize the Villain. Rag. Can you believe her, Sir? She spits her Venom, now she's trod upon. Tam. Hold me up, Crantor, I am faint with Sorrow. Desp. I, and with Poyson too. Here was the Dagger kept To vindicate my wrongs upon thy Daughter, Whom now Ragalzan poyson'd: Thou hast not many minutes left to live, Nor I, to tell thee how. [Dies. Tam. Blest be the hand that did it: hadst thou spar'd One Life, more precious than my own, thou might'st Have bustled with the briskest Female Saints For place in Glory. Ire. Oh, generous Soul! Oh, my belov'd Axalla! Kneeling by him. Oh, tell thy poor Irene, why thou wast So kindly cruel to thy self and me? Ax. Live, Princess, live; live to thy Father's Joy, The Empire's quiet, and the Age's Glory: Oh, live, to teach the World more Innocence, And let this Wretch expire; who might have stay'd T'have lov'd you longer, not have serv'd you better. [Dies Ire. What, woud'st thou have me live an Age of Sorrows, When the first moment of thy Fate has kill'd me? I faint apace! Kind Heav'n has hear'd my Prayers: Oh, I come after thee! nothing on Earth shall stop me. Two Angels are my Bridemen, Saints my Singers, The Clouds my Chariot, and the Skies my Shrine; Where I for ever will joyn hands with thine. Oh! 'tis too much to have both Heav'n and Thee. (Dyes.) Tam. She's gone; the sweetest Saint Heav'n ever shin'd with! Guards, bear the guilty Wretch to Death and Torture. Rag. Bear me in Triumph, Guards; I've won the day, And dye a greater Conqueror than thy self, Most Mighty Tamerlane: thou, and my lesser Foes, About my Feet. Tam. Away with the vile Traytor. Ex. with Rag. He urg'd my Patience: now I'le dye in Peace. Oh, now I'm safe! Now the kind Poyson comes To end the Quarrel betwixt Love and Honor, To satisfie my Friends, secure my Fame. You Gods, that make unchangeable Decrees, And lead Mankind in strong, but unseen Lines; If you assume us hence to nobler Seats, Receive me quickly, with a generous freedom, For no man's Works deserve so great Rewards: The powers we have, come from you; And what Thanks Can they deserve, who only pay what's lent, And have no power to Cheat? Perhaps, you scorn The beggarly return of Benefits, Like Trafficking Mankind: If these be your Resolves, My hopes I Anchor on his generous Doctrine, Whose Sepulcher in Jewry I paid Vows to, Who gives Rewards, yet Suffer'd to obtain 'em. And now I find voluptuous death steal on me, And I begin to dream before I sleep: Green Meadows, Silver Streams, and warbling Winds. All the whole Sky a Rainbow. Lovely Sight! Who wou'd not dye for this? Now I'm i'th'Dark; And there I leave thee, World, just as I ever found thee. [Dyes. FINIS.</field>
