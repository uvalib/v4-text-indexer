      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. The Danish Fleet at Gainsborough. Enter Canute, Thororin, and Hardegon. Canute. My father dead! O Skulda, not in sight! At eve among our slaughtered warriors The fierce Valkyries missed him. On his couch He groaned and died ignoble. Hardegon. With no scar, And yet he swore he bled. Thororin. In health and valour He stood among his men, a mighty man, Straight as a fir-tree on Norwegian hills, When of a sudden limb and eye were cowed; He shivered as a trunk before the axe; And crying,âHelp! St. Edmund comes to slay! He fell to earth a madman. All night through He called the surgeon to his uncut flesh In torment and despair. At early dawn He started and turned quivering to the light, Then broke into a shriek, He comes again! And, pulling up the skins about his eyes, Sank breathless. Canute. O my father, hadst thou lain Within thy lighted ship upon the sea, And felt the gnawing of thy funeral fire In every failing member, I, thy son, Had joyously beheld. But on thy pillow!â Hardegon. Would he had left St. Edmund's town in peace! He saw a spectre. Well I deem the dead A people by themselves; come of what stock They will, it's in a ghost to freeze the blood. I doubt not that St. Edmund wore a frock White like a girl's, and yet was bright as Baldur About the head. These Christians have a way Of shining that dumbfounders. I have stopped Hacking the bald-heads, frighted by that clear, Fixed smiling. There is magic in these monks; They must not be insulted; and our king Sneered at the dead man's altar. Canute. Thororinâ These saints we slay, these peaceful priories We burn to blackness in their green retreats, Have deep, compelling power and ordered sway, That trouble and subdue me. I have stood Among the smouldering orchards, and a sound Of strange, invisible woe has struck my ear, Wandering around the ruins. When I leap On board my dragon-vessel, loose my soul To the dark blast, scent the accustomed foam, I call on Odin; when the sea grows calm, I think of those still churches, their grey priests, With gracious, learnÃ¨d faces. They rebuke My lawless blood, yet satisfy a want That lurks within my brain. Hardegon. What is this folly? It is the things of old that keep us men. Thororin. A gentle worship is not for a people Whose mothers nurse them in a shaggy land Of pines, and scarpÃ¨d rocks, and howling wolves; Whose fathers row their children out to sea, And make the waves their playfellows, the storm Their foster-sire; who all their after days Dwell in the whirl of nature. Canute. I am back With my old gods when there's a mighty wind, That sets my locks a-sail. O Hardegon, I am a Viking still. I, as my sires, Worship All-father's Raven, as I mow My way through corpses underneath its pinions; Yet with a curious dread I pause to hear The monks chant in the vales. Thororin. I know the music; It cannot match the short sweep of our verse, That hath a wind behind it. Canute. I shall live To be the grandest theme, my Thororin, Harp ever sounded. Hardegon, take cheer; I will hold sway in all the northern lands, And in this well-loved England base a throne That Cerdic's race shall shake not. Hardegon. Sense at last! Thororin. And inspiration. Oh, he fires my heart! Canute. Who enters? [Enter Edric.] Hardegon. Edric, the sly alderman That overtops all England. Canute. Then a fellow To use with skill and caution. Edric. On my knees I greet the king. I have vast influence, Am husband to the princess, own a store Of schemes and secret counsels. Verily In me you have a God-send. Canute. Whom we greet. Edric. I come to tell of treason. Hardegon. Let us hear Your lies. Edric. I bring a mouthful of sour news; But if the Northmen cannot brook the truthâ Canute. Speak openly. Edric. Then let them not believe. The English Witan, breaking every oath Sworn to the Dane, despatch their messengers To Ethelred, entreating his return From Normandy, his refuge and retreat. They will receive him, so he govern better; You they will outlaw. Canute. Yet with hostages They sealed a compact to obey King Swend. Traitors! Edric. Heyday! This whelp has deadly ire. Canute. I pant for vengeance on the perjurers. No honour, and no faith! Hardegon. The viking spirit! This is the ancient mood. Edric. What means his silence? Thororin. His eyes are sharp with lightning, and his forehead Like a black sea-cliff on which nods the corn. Canute. It was a bond, they gave us hostages. By Odin, Thor, and Frey, I swear I will exact the penalty Of broken faith. As they have lost my trust, Their children now shall lose hands, noses, all That tempts the knife. Forth with the prisoners! Hack, Lop them like saplings, make them bare of features As woodmen leave their trees. [Thororin sweeps his harp.] Hardegon. I hear the order With joy;âso like old Gorm's commands, right manly, Just, pitiless! [Exit Hardegon.] Canute. [To Thororin.] Look on. There will be moods When, with your harp, you must rehearse this scene; My nature will require it. They are boys; YetâThororin, I will not take their lives; Let them learn horror of their fathers' sin, Return them branded to their infamous Begetters. [Exit Thororin.] Englishman, a bond with you To work my cause with honesty and skill. This Edmundâ Edric. Is a foe to circumvent. The stripling is already on his way, Sent by his exiled father to the Witan With promises;âspeeches will have small weight Spoken for Ethelred, who lolls his tongue Which way is best for scraping off the flies; But this young prince has something in his look So prompt and trustyâcomely-faced like you, And fresh, but more the bearing of a man. Canute. He seeks the Witan; let him come to me, And I will make him captain of a band Of most efficient youths. Edric. No menaces! We must have patience; when he heads the army, I promise you to draw his forces off Under his very nose. I simply ask A twelvemonth for his ruin. Give me time. [A deep cry is heard.] Canute. They suffer, Edricâyour young countrymen. Edric. A shifty folk, these English. Canute. Traitors' ways! Mine is the land; I will reconquer it, Will ravage, leave these waving, marshy flats, These crumbling bays, and strike into the corn. The horse-hoof gives possession. I will ride. Edric. Your father fell a victim to a saint; Best get him under ground. Canute. King Swend shall rest At Roskild with his ancestors. Declare Among your countrymen his death was caused By stumbling of his horse. Edric. Ah, no more lies, All honesty, and yetâA vicious brute, That flung his rider, kicked his skull, the rest Was all delirium from injury. I have the cue. Canute [pacing excitedly]. It is my father's land: Hath it not felt his mutilating mark From north to south? Hath the corn e'er been reaped He hath not trampled? Is there town or hamlet Unblackened by his fires? Hath he not quelled These English hinds? I will lay siege to London, And snatch his fame from Edmund. As a tempest Travels the kingdoms of a mighty plain, Then breaks on one doomed spot, I will descend On him in sudden ruin. He shall feel In me the power and pressure of the North; The strength of fighting Asi; all that happened In Gorm's fierce bosom when he eyed a coast, And the lust seized him for its ravaging. A taunt, a challenge, and the waves are black With dragon-fleets. I summon to my blood The terrors of dead sea-kings. [Re-enter Thororin and Hardegon.] Hardegon. They are ready, This English band. Will you not look on them? As useless as old women, these fine youths. They felt it when we lopped away their hands. Canute [laying his hand on his sword]. Did I say that? . . . I was infuriate. You are not in the service of King Swend; Wait till I cool ere you obey my orders. Where lies my father? I will learn the truth, Handle, and scan his body. Oh, to think That there should be no wounds, no gory issue For his tremendous soul! Hardegon. They covered him Most carefully, such fear was in his eye. Canute. But I will cow this Edmund, this young Christian Who bribes his saint for executioner. Pull down your harp, my Thororin, the chords May bring some colour to the dead man's cheek. [Aside.] And, Hardegon, learn the full policy Of yon ill-spoken, braggart Englishman. When you have brought me to my father's corpse, Look to his motives. [Exeunt Canute, Thororin, and Hardegon. Edric, having overheard Canute's last words, stretches himself on the royal chair vacated by him.] Edric. Look to his motives. They will be clever who get at them. I haven't a brain to hatch them. Wide-awake and no scruplesâa man can do wonders by just keeping an eye on the weather-cock. Motives! They think I married the king's daughter for the sake of the blood royalâand I took her to bring down her pride with low jokes, for she once curled her lip at me. To pour one's ribaldry on a delicate princess, with the Church to tell her all is innocent in wedlock, it has been a rare pastime! But last year I had better company, the king sent me to escort his Old Lady, as they call her, to Normandy. She has the wit of the couple and a graceâ 'tis a pleasure to be near her, for she bows over your ear as softly as she would with the fellows at court. If I could but have her for my mistress when King Ethelred has done languishing. But she is too keen and lofty. I could never cure her of her condescension, and besides I am not amorous. I like to play with fools and turn them round my fingers. There is nothing to appeal to in me âno conjuring by Odinâor our Lady. I am careful to scrape away association from fact. Significance, suggestion! âthey are the bane of life. That banner floating there, they have worked a raven on it, and they worship the black image like an idol. Flap a bit of cloth in the wind, and you can lead men like sheep to the slaughter. But I am not gulled. That banner is to me an indifferent shred of cloth,âand everything is what it seems. I care no more for a parchment than for the leather on my shield. And this young Prince Edmund, with his open face and hope of redeeming his father's honour! He is full of superstition and cannot thrive. [Re-enter Hardegon.] Well, you wonder what has brought me to your master? Old statesman, it is this: your master is going to win; and I am the only Englishman who can bring my own prophecy to pass, for he will not conquer without artifice. The English prince hates cunning, so I hate him; every man likes to have employment for his faculties. Hardegon [aside]. He is as ugly as foul weather at sea. Report to your young prince how we served his hostages, but don't brag you sat sprawling in my master's royal seat. It is unnatural to see you here at all. You are by rights our enemy. Edric [rising and yawning]. Oh, you will not have me long a spy on your tactics. I have no particular ambition. I just rode over here as a friend to let you know what was chancing. I am indolent by nature; you must take my time; but you will find it worth your while to make me comfortable. Just give me fodder for my nag, and your best flavoured Danish dishes. Hardegon. My own lads shall serve you [aside], and keep a watch on you too, till you turn your reins southward. Here, Harold, Ralf, an English alderman wants feeding. These youngsters will be your squires; but have a care. Return to your own folk. English faces will have to suffer now for their saint turning murderer. [Exit Edric attended.] They were fine boys we hacked; that is a fellow wants pelting with the bones one has gnawed, till he is punched in. I would do it myself, if it were not for orders. Orders, forsooth, from my young Viking! I shall have hard times with him; he is uncertain and masterful. [Exit.] Scene II. Malmesbury. The Orchard. Enter Edmund and Elgiva. Edmund. Elgiva, I am come for you, my wife. Kiss me! You come out in the orchard, sweet, Lest envious nuns should leer at our encounter, As the unclean at innocence. That woman Who can bear witness of a stolen kiss I would abandon to the rosary's Perpetual toil; but who should brag of lovers, New-mating lovers, as we twain, should never Look on the sun again. Dear, we are free; It is the summer morning of our love; And now my little, flushing, English rose Can open all the treasures of her breast To the benignant air. Give me your lips. Elgiva. I will not, Edmund; in my very sight My lord was basely murdered. There he sat Haughty and awkward, my great, trustful Dane, At Edric's board. I noted that the princess Was pale, she twitched her hand, she beckoned me Aside, and looking up, I saw the room Full of armed men, my husband in the midst, Astonished, fighting with tremendous fists, The lady pressed me to her bosom close To hide me from the slaughter, but I broke Away, and climbing to the casement saw The chapel blazing where the hunted guests Had fled for sanctuary. It is reported That Edric is the Atheling's counsellor, Edricâthe lying tongue, the false, false lip. I am an Englishwoman, and I cherish My country to this plot of orchard-ground: I would not cede an inch of English earth, No, nor the seas, they should be English too, With cities of strong ships. And I would love The line of Cerdic; but I must abhor The fitful, shifty, dismal, obstinate, Untoward Ethelred, who damps the hopes Of his stout, rallying subjects, who at Council, Where men should meet for justice, planned the murder Of my great Danish earl: and if his son Knew of the vile intentâO Edmund, Edmund! Edmund [walking apart]. Arraigned a traitor by the girl I love, I cannot speak. I will return to her When the last Dane is driven to his ship. And yet, without her woman's faith, I go Unharnessed to the field. [Approaching her.] Then you dismiss me, Uncomforted, to raise an English band, That will grow sullen, and refuse to fight, As you refuse to love, because I bear The name of Ethelred the Redeless' son? Yet, lady, you have seen me in the midst Of strong temptation play no miscreant's part. That day you looked up from your wedding-veil, I knew I was beloved. A deadly wrench! I saw you yielded to the Danish earl, Your precious body, the pure maidenhood, I would have crowned with queenship, and I swore Never again to look upon your face; I banished you my heart's realm, nor revoked The sentence, till this day a messenger Told of your husband's death, and how you fled To seek protection in these holy walls. Elgiva. O Edmund, my great lover, my dear prince, Speak to me, pardon me, ask o'er again For what you asked. Edmund. Give me those honest eyes, Where there is nothing hidden. What a mirror! Love, I would look down in the golden depths, And find reflection. Elgiva. Dearest heart, believe, As in the orchard every part o' the tree Is apple, from the blossom to the drooping O' the rosy, laden branches,âyou will find No part of me, my first, girlish joy In your young, royal face, that is not worship. Give me the freedom of your brow, my kisses Long to set record there. Edmund. The lips, the lips! [passionately kissing her.] Elgiva, we are lord and lady here I' the flecking sunlight; but Canute would rend Our England from us. Elgiva. He shall be repulsed; For I have great possessions, and have suffered To see my goodly acres in the hands Of a sea-farer and a foreigner. Edmund. Heir to your husband's confiscated fiefsâ Then I will seek my father, and demand The lordships. Elgiva. Edmund, let them be my gift; Exact no rights. Why should men force a boon, Grasp masterful, and take from us our joyâ To give, to give? My lands are yours for ever, Yours with their wealth of stalwart fighting-men, Yours for the muster, for the battlefield, The bloodshed, and the triumph; yours at last For pasture, blessÃ¨d as this golden sward, When you are England's king. [Enter messenger.] Edmund. A messenger! Elgiva. And from his aspect I believe he bears Some weighty news. [Edmund meets the messenger. They converse apart.] To lie down on the grass, Look up to him, and feel he is my own! His face grows solemn, and a majesty Darkens his quiet eyes. [Exit messenger.] Edmund. King Ethelred Hath died in London. My true-hearted city, Thee I possess; but of my ravaged kingdom What part beside? The bishops, aldermen, Are all without the walls, and will elect The valiant young Dane who rules the north, And 'gainst the stronghold of our English life Presses his splendid fleet. Elgiva. But you are king; Shire will help shire now you are in command, And render you their services as freely As I confer my love; for I am England, Who, when I doubted, would have none of you, Who pleaded that the Dane had qualities Meet for men's reverence; and rally now All native forces in me to proclaim Edmund my lord. Oh, there are faithful souls; Trust in your people, give your heart to them, And put for ever from your side the churl, False-speaking Edric. Edmund. Let him come and go; He is ill-governed. Doubtless he fulfilled, Murdering the Danish earl, some infamous Plot of my father's. I shall treat him well; The reign of vile suspicion is at end, And honour to the fore. Elgiva. O happy country! I never saw this level orchard-ground So full of gleams and shades. I am right glad That you made love beneath the apple-trees; They are so English, and their rosy fruit Is plucked in tranquil, happy, autumn days, Such as our Edmund will restore to us, When the great wars are ended. A sweet spot! [Exeunt.] Scene III. London. Ethelred's corpse, on a great bed, in a large room. Enter Emma. Emma. Thou infamy, the harlots found thee fair! Vindictive, mercenary, treacherous, vile, A laggard, and a waverer; how well Did nature fit thee for thine enemies, Thy mistresses, and all corrupting things. The worm that eats thy body will revolt At the unvirgin soil. Yea, I will speak. Death gives us widows opportunity To put such questions as at judgment-day Will rise in accusation. From my anger Thou canst not hide; thy face is bare and fixed Before my eyes and lips. Didst thou not sport With other women, while I bore thee sons With Saxon faces, boys so like their father I loathed to give them suck, young heritors Of thy unfeatured kingship, timid lads, For whom I begged a refuge at the table Of my great Norman brother? Dost thou hear? Wilt thou not bribe me from my inquisition? Nay, but thy Danish foe shall take thy place, In my own inmost bower. Ah me, ah me! Bride to the Viking! What deep modesty Restrains me from the thought? I grew a girl, When, from the walls of London, I looked down On his young, glittering, tempestuous face, And blushed, and gave him all the terms he sought To win one smile. I look about the chamber; Do I resign my queenship? I am fair, My finger-tips can thrill men to their doom, And my whole body is for empery. I do not crave to rule; I crave to spend The flower o' my years, my faculties, my grace, In service of a simple, king-like man, Clean as the ocean, and as terrible I' the day of tempest. [Going up to the corpse.] Redeless thing, thou'rt dead. My soul peals to the echoâdead, dead, dead! [Enter Edric.] What brings you hither, my fair son-in-law? Has faithful London looked upon your face, And suffered quiet passage through her streets? You leave the Dane? Edric. Since you would have me give My services to this young cub of Swend, I give them; and report in Edmund's ear That I am rallying forces in the north. But for my presenceâdo not feign surprise; You summoned me to bear you to the court Of Normandy. I am obedient To your least whim, but fear that I have journeyed O'er hastily. I find you at your vigils. Emma. Weeping the man who has dishonoured me. Edric. There is a sure revenge. Now is your time For freedom and for pleasure. Emma. Insolence! [Aside, glancing toward the bed.] I would not be his mate in anything, Nor re-enact his lewdness. I am free, Free, till I love.âHow fares the Danish monarch? We met once. Edric, does he speak my name In the same way as yours? Edric. 'Tis never breathed Within my hearing. Emma. Time is in my hair. [Aside, taking a mirror.] I am a matron and a queen, and yet There is a starving girlhood in this face, That bitterly contrasts. Edric. Now cheerly! Once I named you, and he started to his feet, Calling his men to vanquish Ethelred; That day the foe was routed. Emma. Thane, on you I build my future and my blessedness. Let not his ears forget my syllables; Picture my destiny. Edric. I'll make it ring. Emma. You shall not mention meâexcept my pride. Edric. A young man soon forgets. Emma. False, false; in youth There is a warm fidelity; all's cold When greybeards hug the past. [Aside.] Oh, my beloved! Edric. Lady, take heart. I am a counsellor The raw, young soldier may not well despise; And I will show him the advantage. What! You blench; I mean I will extol the beauty Of my fair mistress. Yet I claim reward. Come now, a kiss. Emma. My lips are put away For some high festival. Edric. You yield your hand? Emma. As I were still a queen. It costs some pangs To part with royalty. My blessÃ¨d crown, My fond, familiar circlet. Ah, alas! My hair falls unsupported by this wreath Of gold. Edric. A fair decline. Put this aside, [Touching the crown.] Or rather, press it to your lips, and swear To give me of your widowhood some hours, Ere you again are royal. Emma. Edric, hush! 'Tis my ambition makes me amorous; And I will give you sweeter recompense Than any woman's favour may confer. Share this my royal passion; make me queen, And I will win for you the highest place In the young Viking's trust. You will not sway My second husband as you swayed my first; But I have tracked allegiance in your eyes, You feel he is your master. Edric. Ironsides Has valour. Emma. And a child's simplicity; A melancholy, brave, clear-purposed man, Whom any knave may cozen. Let it be Your part to circumvent him. Love the Dane, And you shall rise in honour. Edric. Well, I swearâ Give me your hand to print my oath upon. Emma. Edric, refrain! My step-son at the door, Must not behold us in close colloquy. [Edric advances to the door, and greets Edmund.] Safe, safe! He has not touched me. [Looking toward the bed.] Safe from him, The licensed to defile. And now how sweet My maidenhood returns on me. To fill Some narrow convent bed in Normandy, Dream of Canute, and all day say my prayers! But that is not so cleansing. Oh, this love Is a diviner power than holiness; It puts all evil past imagining, And crowds the soul as full as Paradise With rapturous desires. Ah me, they come, And I must to my tears. [Drooping over the corpse.] Edric [to Edmund]. You give consent, Most noble Atheling, that I bear away Your lady-mother to Duke Richard's court? Edmund. She doubtless will be welcome there, and here Adds to confusion. Take her oversea. Emma [half-aside]. I cannot leave him, such a proper man He looks, with that great brow and curling hair. He has won many hearts. [Enter Edith and the child.] Edmund. My sister comes To pray for the great dead. Disturb her not By more than briefest parting. Edric. My sweet wife, You bring our boy to look upon your sire; May he repeat his virtues! [Edith shudders.] Edmund [to the child, drawing him away from the bed]. Ah, my man, Your grandsire was so loved, when wicked Swend Was smitten by St. Edmund, whose dear name I bear, the English people called him home To govern them again. They rally now Round me, his son, your king. Down on your knees; You rascal, do me homage! Child [glancing fearfully at the corpse]. Who has made him Like that? O father! Edric. See the lad! He thinks That I have power of life and death. [Aside.] I train him To wither at a look. Though terrified, He shall be forced to creep up to the corpse, And toucn it.â[Aloud.] Come now, kiss your grandfather. He cannot hurt you. Never be afraid. [The child goes straight up to the king's body, and shrieks.] [To Edmund.] He does whate'er I tell him; I can count On that.âNow, sirrah, down upon your knees; You must learn all your duty. Swear to fight For good King Edmund. Child. I shall be a priest, But I will bless your armies. I am glad That you will rule. Edric [to Edith]. I go to Normandy, My saintly princess. To your brother's care And your just grief I leave you. But our boyâ Edmund. I will instruct my nephew. Emma [embracing the child]. Dearest child, My infant Ethelred, thy living cheek Shall take the print of my last English kiss; For, oh, I cannot give my lips again To that cold, marble brow. [To Edmund.] Our elder son, Recover our lost kingdom. Edric. Noble prince, I shall make haste to hear the proclamation Of your new royalties, when this fair lady Is rendered to her kinsman. [Aside.] Mark my purpose; To rid you of the dowager means friendship,â No step-dame on the throne! Edmund. Lady, farewell. [Exeunt Emma and Edric.] Edith. My brother! What, together and alone By this dear bedâto clasp you in my arms, To feel that you are here, our country's lord And saviour, and that no usurper's hand Will tear our father's crown! Edmund. Dear, send the boy Away; his eyes are wandering fearfully, Too shy to look upon this stranger, Death, That puts us from our ease, who every day Encounter him. Edith. Go, darling, to your prayers In the near chamber. [Exit child.] All the Londoners Are staunchly yours? Edmund. Edith, all Englishmen Are mine; they lack a leader, but their faith Is without flaw. Edith. You think there will be peace? Edmund. Hard fighting rather. We will give our blood To these invaders, and our gold shall feed The sick and hungry. Glorious battlefields Shall glow upon our southern pasture plains; Where the sheep graze such victories shall be won As shall not need the cairn to chronicle. Edith, I bear my people in my heart As bard his unbreathed song. Edith. Yet stay to mourn Our father; he is desolate and cold. Let me draw back the curtain. Edmund [looking steadfastly at Ethelred]. Ah, no bribes, No hostages, thyself, To pay the penalty when death exacts. No more evasion, the straight road to hell, And Judas' bag for thy blood-rusted gold. Away, to the true miser! Edith. Edmund, Edmund! Give him your prayers; we may redeem him still. Edmund. From his deserts? Then I shake off religion. Heaven looks facts in the face; he sold his country, Which in a king is as he sold his God. He made all fearful, for he put no trust In any man, and he has died a stranger To life's sweet faiths and holy confidence. He leaves a Danish heir, but honest Edric Makes secret preparation for my rule. Edith [nervously caressing him]. When we were children, and your play-fellows Would cheat at games, you let me counsel you, And show who played you false. As king, beware; Lean not on Edric's love. Edmund. Edith, your husband! I never will be warned the damnÃ¨d way Of vile suspicion. You misjudge the thane, And irritate his plain, outspoken nature With timid reticence. Edith. One cannot love A stranger as one loves the face one knows As early as the sky. Edmund. Dear heart, although The pompous Emma from our mother's tomb Hath turned the people's thoughts, we two possess, Each in the other, a fair gift of hers For keepsake and remembrance. Hast thou heard Of my great joy? Elgiva is my wife, And of her frank, sweet nature I will get A race clear as the stars. Your pretty lad, For his sake I could wish a brood of girls; All Cerdic's majesty is in his face; Though he is sickly. . . Alfred as a child Was fragile, loved his missal. Never fear But he will make a man, though full of thought, And blue-eyed as an angel. Comfort, love! Will you not come along? The priests attend. Then I must bid farewell. [They kiss. Exit Edmund.] Edith. How angrily They all turn from his pillow! In the midst Of the great winter storms I often sighed To be with those whom the encircling sea, When it blew inward on our isle, submerged. I think they will lie quiet in the deep, Unharassed by the Judgment: no account Is left of them; their villages and towns Have all escaped taxation and distress; They are no more bewildered by the dread Of an invader;âwhilst, alas! these kings Can lay no hold upon oblivion. There is great beauty still upon his face; It hath not been beloved. Infirmity Sows sorer rancour in men's hearts than crime: I know not why. He shall have many prayers. [She kneels by the bed. Enter monks chanting.] Scene IV. Southampton. Enter Canute, Hardegon, English and Danes. Canute. Ye have proclaimed me king! 'Tis said at London The citizens choose otherwise; no more In terror of my girding troops, they give Oaths to the untried son of Ethelred. Where lies your loyalty? Has Ironsides Your secret love? Or do you give your hearts To me, receive me as your rightful lord, Trust me to cleanse the country of all robbers, Liars and cheats, and ever doom just dooms Alike to rich and poor? Will ye exalt My dignity, and follow my command, As mindful all ye do in faithfulness Is to your own behoof? English. We will maintain Our choice, and with a strict fidelity Cleave to our King Canute. Canute. Now ye are mine I will re-knit your virtue, make your throne A seat of glory. Think not whence I am; Let Danes and Englishmen beneath my sway Become a world-known race. Bear witness all How I love England,âher enfolding seas, Her woods, her valley-hayfields, river-sheds Where cattle graze the meadows. I was born In haunts of desolation; here abides A sense of times gone by, of ancient law, Religious benediction. My wild home Seems but mere earth on which to breathe and eat; This island has a human, blessÃ¨d bond Between itself and men. English. 'Tis yours to hold, And govern as you will; we bow beneath The dictates of your pleasure; there is nought On earth that may resist you. Canute [aside]. Flattery! They think me a dull savage.âYe have spoken Beyond the truth. I bid you turn and look Upon those billows sweeping to the shore, With augment, arch, depression. Do you tell me That they would stay their muster, check their onslaught And fury of defiance at my bidding? If you would love me, give me faithful tongues In all you sayâI have no appetite For adulation. Go ye hence, and gather An army meet to grapple with great Edmund: For ye have chosen me, but your election Hard fighting must confirm. English. Long live the king! [Exeunt.] Hardegon. We gave these pretty Englishmen the breath of flames and the smoke of homesteads. Now it is all excellent England. Enemies, I take it, are as natural to a man as babes to a woman. Ghosts of the Vikings! Would our mothers know our voices? Canute. I am king now in a country where there is corn-growing and the sound of bells. I must be a Christian. Hardegon. And you know not a word of the mystery. You a Christian! Ay, stick your great hands in your hair and redden. They'll have the laugh of you. Canute. I will learn, I must alter. I am not simply the grand-child of Gorm. These battle-fields are just the beginning. Afterwards. . . . Hardegon. The folly! Rob a man of his ancestors, you take all. My best hope is to become an ancestor âno hold on posterity, if you be not a god to it. Then just think what a time it takes a bit of coast to vary! When I sail up the fiords, the water-falls drop from the same cliff, the walls of the white steeps have not budged. And we reckon on these things. If they fail, there is no stability. I ask you, are not the gods changeless, must not divinity dwell among the old ways? Canute. O Hardegon, there are answers to these questions; they are coming on the waves to me. [Looking out on the sea abstractedly.] [Enter Thororin.] Thororin. Listen! my harp is tuned; it shivers to praise you. I have had a great madness to sing as I saw the warriors gather, and heard the blast take your name inland. Canute [unheeding]. No wisdom near me,âa dunce and a ruler! Oh, this shame of ignorance, that will not hide itself; that must come out, and suffer, and be mocked! I sob all night for the misery. 'Tis a secret that cannot be kept, yet the breaking it. . . If one loved me! [seeing Thororin.] Oh, how horrible! More praise of my big sinews. I'll be sullen. [Turns away.] Thororin. Deaf to my exaltation, no ear for a poet! Let me beg, Sire, you listen to my song; it is short. Canute. And I am the subject. The insolence of these verse-makers! They would have all life a general ear for their bit of piping breath, or they stare and begin to rail. Off with you, minstrel! Thirty strophes more of your theme, or you lose your head to-morrow. Thororin. Pshaw!âbut the threat is nothing. The wind, a sand-hill, and a cry for dreams, and I am full of singing that instant. Canute. Thirty strophes, and stuffed with comparisons and reverence. [Exit Thororin.] Hardegon. How he twirls his finger round the flames on his lip, all impatience for me to go. He has a sea- bred face. 'Tis a shame for the true, old things to lose him. I will bring one who can speakâwith a voice that is like the rush of water from amid the foam of her hairâGunhild, the prophetess. [To Canute.] Strange, you should have taken to fretting, and all since the siege of London! [Exit.] Canute. All, all since then. Ah, yes! Above me bent A sweet, soft-shouldered woman, with supreme, Abashing eyes, and such maturityâ The perfect flower of yearsâsuch June of face . . . So ceremonious, and yet so fearless In passionate grace, that I was struck with shame, And knew not where I was, nor how to speak, Confounded to the heart. She made me feel That I was lawless and uncivilized,â Barbarian! In all my brave array I shrank from her, as she had caught me stripped For some brute pastime. Is this womanhood? There's more to see each time one looks at her, There's music in her; she has listened much, Pored o'er the lustrous missals, learnt how soft One speaks to God, with silky filaments Woven weird pictures of the fates of men. Her smile is not a new-born thing, 'tis old, And mellow as the uncut, timeless jewel. Her forehead's runic,âit is just to-day On other faces, but this lady's brows Are full of fond tradition and romance. I'll be her scholar, she shall teach me all, And changeâyea, as I love her, I am changed In my ambition, in my appetites, In my blood, and aspiration. [Turning to some parchments.] For her sake I wrestle with these laws. My eyes are dim, Worn out with gazing, and my brain is slow To take the import. Sometimes on my vessel When my dull brain is drowsy with the salt, I muse on this new wisdom, till its weight Oppresses me with slumber, as it rises In such great bulk before me. [Reads the parchments, sitting.] [Re-enter Hardegon with Gunhild.] Hardegon. At his learning! Deal with him, spare him not. Canute. Whom hast thou brought? A brooding face, with windy sea of hair, And eyes whose ample vision ebbs no more Than waters from a fiord. I conceive A dread of things familiar as she breathes. Gunhild. O king. Canute. Ay, Scandinavia. Gunhild. He sees How with a country's might I cross his door; How in me all his youth was spent, in me His ancestors are buried; on my brows Inscribed in his religion; through my frame Press the great, goading forces of the waves. Canute. Art thou a woman? Gunhild. Not to thee. I am Thy past. Canute. Her arms are knotted in her bosom Like ivy-stems. What does she here, so fixed Before my seat? Gunhild. Hearken! I wandered out Among the brake-fern, and the upright flags, And snatching brambles, when the sun was gone, And the west yellow underneath the night. A fir-bough rolled its mass athwart my way, With a black fowl thereon. All eve I stood And gathered in your fate. You raise your hands To other gods, you speak another tongue, You learn strange things on which is Odin's seal That men should know them not, you cast the billows Behind your back, and leap upon the horse. You love no more the North that fashioned you, The ancestors whose blood is in your heart:â These things you have forgotten. Canute. Yes. Gunhild. But they Will have a longer memory. Alas, The mournfulness that draws about my breasts! Woe, Woe! There is a justice of the Norn, Who sings about the cradle. Canute. Speak thy worst. [Aside, rising and pacing apart.] How different my queen! How liberal The splendour of her smile! This woman's frown Is tyrannous. So will my country look, When I sail back next year; for I shall feel A dread, a disappointment, and a love I loathe, it comes up from so deep a well, Where I am sod and darkness. Gunhild. At thy birth Sang Urd of foregone things, of thy wild race, Of rocks and fir-trees that for ages past Stood in thy native bounds, of creeping seas, That call thy countrymen to journey forth Among strange people; and her song went on As flesh was woven for thee in the womb; It cannot be forgotten, for she sang Beginnings. Canute. O grey-headed tyrannies Of yore, I will escape you. Gunhild. Verily, They have requital. Thou wilt get a child: Will it not draw from the deep parts of life; Will it not take of thee that disposition, Old as the hills, and as the waterfall, Whose foam alone was ever seen by man? Thou wilt produce a being of thy past, And all thy change avail not. Hardegon. How these women Can sing foundations! Canute. If in those I breed It work no blessing, to myself this new, Unsettled energy within my brain Is worth all odds. I cannot understand Half that is meeting me. Go hence, your face Is sheer confusion to me; it brings back The load of ignorance, the brutishness, The fetters of nativity. Gunhild. I go: But wrathful leave behind me what was told When the crow bent from the swirled plume of fir, And held me like a statue. Canute. O my past, I loved thine aspect once, but now my mind Drives thee away. It seems to me that thought Is as a moving on along the airâ I cannot yet find language. You oppress, And hinder me; but when I brood alone, Hope stirs, and there is tumult of a joy, That flashes through my nature, like a sword, Cutting the knots. Gunhild. Oh, indestructible Are the first bonds of living. Fare thee well. Thou wilt engender thine own ancestry; Nature will have her permanence. Canute. And I Will have my impulse. Gunhild. Oh, the blue fir-bough, The bird, the fern, and iris at my feet! The whole world talks of birth, it is the secret That shudders through all sap. [Exit.] Canute. She turns away With rigid shoulders, and is vanishing For ever. 'Tis in wrestles with her like We are transformed. [To Hardegon.] Call Edric, do you hear! And say no other word as you would live; My temper will not bear it. [Exit Hardegon] Winsome queen, Emma, great lady, could I reach thy feet, Thou hadst ne'er known such homage. It is youth, Youth in its awful kindling; it is love, When all the body is possessed by want Of what it would be worthy of;âsuch youth, Such love I give thee. Deeper than my race, Deeper than all my past thy sway is set; So able are thy brows, such strength is thine, Thou art beneath all other elements, They are no more the same. Oh, wonderful! For I have clipped a woman in my arms, The silent Elfgifu, my Danish wife; And I have known the pleasures, but they passed; I was not altered; in my head no light, No current through my faculties, no whirl Of giddy charm. [Enter Edric.] Edric, you are the man; You have the opportunity that chance Withholds from me. Edric. [aside]. He tramps about and catches His garment's hem, a burning in his eyes.â Speak out, and plainly. Canute. Ha!âThe troops come in? Do they not muster? I am thinking, Edric, 'Tis time now for my tactics, for the plan Of conquest and repulse. You'll find me keen, And ready as a captain. Edric. I could swear You have resource. You are a soldier's son, And know how valid is the right of craft Toward foemen. Canute. Yes, to take them unawares By artifice and ambush. Look you, thane, I must possess this kingdom. I am moved To actions of vast consequence, and need Space for great laws, the power to mould a nation To flawless homage. What the means you choose I care not; anything I hold as just That will establish justice. Edric. So I think. Canute [aside]. My breath draws back her name from off my tongue; I cannot utter it. Edric. The army grows, The Raven flaps for victory, my pate Teems with its stratagems. Soon will you be A single ruler; though perchance you'll ask Another for her company. [Aside.] He's red, As if the northern light leapt through his face; Ho, ho! Can't keep his counsel.âIs your mind Set on the empire of a bachelor? You own too hot a pulse. Canute. I have no doubt But I shall marry. Edric. Where's the wife to match An eagle of your plumage? Canute. All the world Is full of stately women. Edric. I have seen But one, the late king's widow. She is prime Among all dames. Canute. You think that you have seen her, Because you know she has a radiant skin, And strange, proud eyes! Edric. Ah, you are touched, young man! But she is twice your age. Canute. She is beloved Past any other woman, who was dear In former times. She holds her century's Most choice attainments. Edric. Will it flatter you To learn that she would throw away her veil, Her husband being buried but a week, To kiss that lip of yours? Canute. Impossible! A brute like me, a child in all but strength, A Christian but in name, her enemy, A spoiler, temple-burner, pirate,âshe, Wise, excellent in grace. Edric. Yet she is yours, With all a woman's haste; you are the theme On which she spends her wisdom. Canute. Such a momentâ My futureâ Edric. He is deaf to what I say. All fire and trembling, ho! Canute. My fate is turned Like a great river from its primal bed Round by new thorpes and fields. My thankfulness Is this: she stoops to love me, but a man Grows up within me she may proudly call Her lover. Edric, I will never ask The honour of her fairest hand, will never Take from her lips the glory of a kiss, Till I am firmly king. Edric. I'll drop some words To keep her merry, she will bide her time; Women can wait by nature. Canute. Scheme, have ready Arms and provision. I will go elsewhere, And study. Read this passage from the scroll; The language puzzles me. It runsâ Edric. Like thisâ If a man be slain, we estimate all equally dear at forty talents of pure gold. Canute. These laws will I remodel, when I read The meanings plainly. They shall be enforced Through the land's length and breadth; and he who kills Pay the due sum. [Aside.] I must out to the air, And splash of the full tide. My joy as yet Is lightning, thunder in my sense, a storm Knit up to break in fury.âGive me this, That parchment, and let no one follow me. Edric. A word of dalliance, a sugared speech To carry to the widow, come! Canute [aside]. The fool! I cannot speak.âTake her my silence, thane. [Exeunt severally.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. Assandun. The English army on high ground above the river Crouch. The Danish army on lower ground, moving with booty toward their ships. Enter Edmund. Edmund. Under the royal ensign I await The Danish onslaught; but I fear the cowards Refuse to grapple, and with robber-stealth Are slinking to their ships. Can I remain Here in my strong position on the hill, And see the wealth of ravaged Mercia borne To pirate vessels? [Enter Edric.] Edric, you mistake The English keep the heights; your Danish chieftain Is skulking with his booty to the shore. Edric. Now what a temper! I have grown so artful In tactics that you take me for a spy; Yet in your six great battles I have helped, As if I stood beside you,âveered about, Given your foes false hope, and spurred them on, Then back to my true post. As for my motive In joining you to-day, I tell you plainly, I acted from a passion in my veins That drove me hither. In the foreign herd I could not tarry. Edmund. It was natural, Your country in such peril. I rejoice To have you by my side, and thus to turn you From action that discomforted my mind, And often stained your honour. Look below. Canute is marching by the river-bed, Laden with plunder: we must intercept: He shall not carry my dear England's wealth Of corn and cattle to the fallow ocean. In proof of trust I give you your old troops, The stalwart Mercian bands; but, Streona, Let there be honest fighting. All my soul Abhors deceit. It ill becomes a Christian, And Englishman, to play his wits against A rude, untutored warrior. Edric. To-day I show you my true colours; you shall learn My inner disposition. Edmund [to his army]. Englishmen, Attack those recreants hastening to the sea; Hard hand-play give the robbers, beat them off From shelter of their boats. Your fathers' spirit Make ye defenders of the land, its fame, Its homes, its ancient crown. Think of the days When Alfred rose among ye, how he smote The northern hosts, and drove them from his fields. Ye have been faithful to me, and have followed The hurry of my marches, borne scant fare, Tempest, and cold, and weariness. Together Six times have we encountered on the plain Yon scowling mariners, and God has given A measure of success. With rush of banners, Descend, and strike them as a thunder-bolt. [Exeunt.] [On the lower ground enter Canute, Hardegon, Thororin, and Danes.] Hardegon. The enemy is on us and our ranks Waver and break; they would not thus have faltered If Swend had marshalled them; he stood so tall, And bellowed out his orders. Thororin [waving the Danish flag]. Let them see The glorious signâour Raven's open beak, And wings that flap triumphant in the wind! Good is the omen; when those plumes are stirred The hour is come for fated warriors To fall beneath the battle-axe. Canute. Stand firm! Give them no inch of ground. Though young in years, My father trained my hands to slaughter, filled me With great ambition for the raging field, Its noble chances. In this valley's breadth Free space is given. Manfully resist. [Re-enter Edmund, and English.] Edmund. I sought you through the ranks. I know your helm, And fierce, bright eyes. You are the Danish chief. Canute. The king of England. Edmund. I deny the name To any stranger in whose alien veins The blood of Cerdic flows not. The great title Is mine by birthright and election. Canute. I Have half the country's voice; my father swayed These lands before me. I will have my own. We'll speak together with the noise of swords; That talk may have an issue. Edmund. So it shall. [Strikes at Canute vehemently. Exit.] Hardegon. Danes, to your king! His shield is cut in twain. Canute. Back, fools; must I be cheated of revenge! He goes, and I am left with cloven arms, Abased and powerless. Hardegon. Odin, how they press us! Retreat, or we are lost. Canute. God only knows Which shall be master; I will wait the end, And then myself cut down my clouded youth, If I am vanquished. Curse that heavy blow; It stunned me like a giant. Down it crashed, And brought a darkness after it. Thororin. My king, A cruel fortune works against our powers; Our fighting men, who struggle with set teeth, Are beaten. I am weary, sick of war. To see the hostile folk upon our track, Hewing behind our fugitives! Canute. The English Are now disturbed; for, with a whirlpool's sweep, Half of their army swings round to our side. Ah, it is Edric! He will save the day; He has deserted. Shout your welcome loud; Pour forth your darts, and speed your death-spears 'gainst The trapped and yielding English. [Re-enter Edric.] Edric. You may fight, But I defeat them with my trickery. They cannot stand against me. All is lost For them; for you, all gained. Canute. Hack, slay, o'erwhelm! [Exit.] [The English and Danes fight desperately.] An Englishman [pointing to Edric]. There is the traitor, the deceiver. Shame! The curse of ignominy take the wretch; May his own snares entrap him! Another. As we fall Our race disowns him. See, from our last glances The devil shrinks, and turns. Comrades, farewell. Another. Farewell, for we must perish, if we stand. [The English are slain. Exeunt Danes and Edric.] [Enter Edmund.] Edmund. Late, and so many slain! A narrow kingdom, But yet of honest souls. Oh, I could stoop, And kiss them, as a woman, one by one. The brave, blue eyes! Each step a recognition. Ulfcytel, Wulfsige! My Ethelweard! I would keep watch beside you, did no remnant Wander the darkness for King Edmund's voice. Brave hearts still ache for me. It is enough! I will divide my kingdom with my foe; We will rule neighbour chieftains. And Canute Shall feel the virtue of my severed lands Pass through his blood? It is impossible; What barrier could divide us? If a river Were made the confine, I would breast the current; Or if the pleasant ranges of clear down Defined my border I should clamber them, And look forth coveting the golden tracts O' the other side. Impenetrable forest Must block me from the view. God's hand hath set The limit of my empire in the sea;â I bear His finger-mark across the sand, It chafes not;âbut wherever English voices Gladden the breeze, there should be deep accord In custom, purpose, hope. [Turning to the dead.] I have a people Will none of the invader; all my best Are here. How simply they laid down their lives! An Englishman sleeps soundly in his death, As fearing no ill vision. Not a man Found faithless; this is Heaven's great reward. [Exit.] [Re-enter by torchlight Canute, Edric, Hardegon, Thororin, and Danes.] Edric. Pooh, pooh! You say 'tis no clear victory: Look at this heap of Edmund's subjectsâall Of note about the court. Canute [looking wistfully at the dead]. And goodly faces! Here is a churchman. What a noble brow, So full of thought and sweetness! These are creatures To stand about a throne. Hardegon. The soil breeds English, And Edmund lives. Canute [impetuously]. This day shall end the war; Peace, treaty, or division of the landâ Soldier [behind]. Hark ye! Edmund gave our king a drubbing; the place hurts, so no more encounters. He's meek as a beaten man; yet we sweated all day for him. Canute [striking him]. And duly Receive your wage, you braggart,âa king's blow To strike you into silence. Hardegon. Bravely done! Thororin. He is stone-dead. This deed shall be recounted. Down sank the dastard, He the defamer; Fierce Canute felled him, Fearful in might. There lies he lifeless, Lost to his mother; Bloodless on battle-field, Branded with shame. Canute. This blinding flicker of the torch! Sweep down The flame across his face, so!âHe is stunned. God! but his look has hardened. Thororin, Stoop, find the breath. Thororin. It will not come again; The blow was fatal,âa swift punishment. Canute [muttering]. Punishment, punishment! and the crime faithful speaking; it is the false tongue wants stopping. [Edric moves away, examining the corpses.] That Edricâfaugh!âI hate to see him fingering the dead. Once he laid his impudent hand on my shoulder. I have no pleasure in these victories; they are the gift of his treachery; I have not won them. All the great English are here, dead and loyal; and the knave spoke true, I am no match for their king. [Aside.] You talk of punishment. By English law A mulct of forty talents is the sum Due from a man who murders in hot blood; But from a king, thrice guilty, triple fine Shall be exacted. I will make amends; We are no more barbarian. Give this fellow An honourable burial; recount, My Thororin, the sequel of my passion. I will to meditation. [Exit.] [As Canute retires, an English messenger is seen approaching his tent.] Thororin. Write the end! Impossible! The Viking is a Christian, And the great virtue of revenge is dead. I sing the fiery current of the blood, Its rapids, its revulsions. Let him learn The mournful metres of tear-dropping women, And mourn each mighty deed. Hardegon. I give him up. Great men can get the virtue out of good And wickedness; they know that right and wrong Work well together. I have seen old Gorm Cry like a baby, but no whit the worse Next day, and ready for a massacre. This lad is hopeless; he will come to terms. [Re-enter Edric.] Here is his enemy, a man to crumble, And eat into his soul.âWhat brings you here? You seek for your old master 'mong the dead? You will not find him, so best spare your pains. Edric. Well, it would have saved trouble; he will scarcely take me into favour again,âbut it is with my new master I must parley. I am the hero of the day. He owes everything to me; and I and my Mercian troops look for reward. I want money and dignities. Ah, there is the royal tent. Just tell our young conqueror I must break on his privacy. [Exit Hardegon.] The dogged, old creature!âbut I sent him trudging on my errand. Now I come to a bit of work I shall relish. This high-bred sea-king thinks he can use me contemptuously. He shall be my dependent. He has a notion of keeping faith; and the oaths he shall break! Oh, it rejoices me to dye folks my own colour, and to see them wince at the discovery of their vileness. You can do it easily with a woman. But it is difficult to menace a keen man, with a conscience, and intrepid. I must convince him he owes everything to me; and a just king rewards his servants; ingratitude is the part of a barbarian. He shall set me in the rank and place I like to name, and then I can degrade him step by step. I will force him to look inwards when he feels contempt. That is how I dominate. [Re-enter Hardegon.] Hardegon. The king is musing; you would interrupt. Edric. The king! He must wait for that title. Then you tell him, if he does not choose to converse with meâ [Re-enter Canute wildly.] Canute. Edric, come hither; I shall need your service. King Edmund has sent to propose that we divide the land. I could win it back for myself with my sword; but your hireling soldiers damp enterprise. There would be no more honour in the war; I could never trust my men again, after they had been in the company of your vile, flattering Mercians. There would be nothing but ill-luck and treachery, so we had best make a covenant, and keep that. Within a week we meet at Olney. I do not know the country. Where lies the fosse? Edric. Ha, ha! Again at fault! I must fight his battles, then prescribe his policy. Wanted at every turn. But thanks first, and wages. Let us wipe off the old score. Canute. Stop that bluster, you recreant! The day would have been ours without your knavery. Our men had begun to rally, and the Raven gave the sign. Edric. Just fancy! the gods were favourable. What a pity I passed into your ranks with weapons. I forgot what a young one you are. If the banner floated right, you did not need recruits. Well, Edmund is a man; if I had kept firm to him, to-night we should have divided the spoil. And the Mercian booty too your pirates were making off withâthat would all have been mine! Canute. You shall be well rewarded. But, Edric, I would have proved myself a soldier. I did not conquer. The field is mine through an artifice. Edric. The result pleases you,âthe issue. Scarcely anything is fit to look at in the process. I am preparing for your glory; leave me a little to myself. As for the boundary-line, we will not hurt our brains with calculations; they are all artificial. A bit of blue sea is the border of our empire, and, if I recollect, it is the royal Danish colour. But come in, come in! I must look to your affairs. If I had not wheeled round to your ranksâ [Moving towards the royal tent.] Canute. There lie your people. Be careful: do not trample friends' faces on your way to my tent. These are all English we are passing; you should know every man by name. Edric. As I was saying, if I had not given you my forces, young man, I should have been saved this business of halving the kingdom. I am indispensable. So no retort. [Exeunt.] Scene II. Olney. The historical meeting took place at Olneyâan island in the Severn. An island in the Ouse. Enter Canute, Edric, Hardegon, Thororin, and Danes. Canute. Edmund is late in coming. It is grey O'er head, and sluggishly the river swims, And laps up its own sound into itself, As cattle are contented with their cud. The noises of these English streams are low After the cry of torrents. Thororin, Yon willow-roots grow in fat peace along, Not like the striving pines. Edric, I own To some rejoicing I am here the first; It gives me sense of full possession. Mind you, I do not think this treaty will endure; Our hosts are tired, and we consent to slumber Till one of us awakes. Edric. Or not.âHe stares Across the river. Did he take the hint? His swift glance was uncertain. Canute [apart]. Now they shout; The boat is launched: it is a hateful moment. [To Edric.] Why do you slip behind me? Edric. But to show I am your servant. Hardegon. 'Tis to hide that face. Canute. He is not yet in sight, no glimpse,âyon isle Of waving grass so blocks the view. My Danes In rows are grimly silent. Thororin, You love the headlong rapids of the North: They fall too sudden; one could never build Beside them, never stablish governments In their rude neighbourhood. Edric, he comes; I see vast shoulders moving through the rushes. Would I might never meet him! Edric. Why? Canute. No matter. Edric. Something has caught your eye among the Danes. Vexed? Canute. 'Tis that woman sitting on the slope, With streaming locks and wind-distended raiment: One fierce hand tugs the grass, the other draws A tress of hair through her uncertain mouth; Her narrowed, eager eyes are fixed on me; They call her Gunhild; long have I defied her. Why is she here? Edric. To see the spectacle; All women love to gape at pageants. Now Edmund is on the stream; the oars are splashing Among the weeds. Heigh! He has got my child Against his side. Canute. Noble to glance at, worn, Though stronger built than I! He cleft my shield; It has not been avenged. A placid look: Much like his country's. Ah, the hateful thought, It makes me feel a stranger, though I call Half England mine. He smiles at that fair boy Dipping his palm,âan honest, brightening pleasure Straight from the eyes. He sees me, and the king Comes forward on his face. I must prepare A welcome. Edric [aside, glancing at Canute]. Ho, his pride! At handy-dandy He cares not to be first. My Dane's full lip Is sulky, in his eyes a sullen gleam. I cannot reach his mood. Best keep behind. [Enter Edmund, the child, and an English train.] Edmund. Hail, brave Canute. That you have met my terms I thank your generosity; forget The strife between us. With clear boundaries, And heavy payment to your fleet, I settle Beside you as a brother in this isle. I am an Englishman, and, once at peace, All grudge and wrath are over. There's my hand. Canute. I like your speech, King Edmund. There is mine. All England lying southward of the Thames, East Anglia and Essex are your realm; Mine what is left. Edmund. A mighty stretch of kingdom! Such the agreement. Now, before all men, Clear-hearted before God, I swear an oath Of friendship and of brotherhood to one Whom I have tried in battle as a man, And would, as king, be bound to. Edric. In a trice Canute is clearing, and a sudden touch Of sun lights up his scowl. Canute. I, too, will swear With a good heart; the heavens seal a vow That I will live your brother. [Aside.] In his grasp There is such amity. Edmund. My arms and mantle Take as a pledge that I am wholly yours In purpose and affection. Canute. Take my shield, My sword, my robe, great Edmund. [They exchange clothes and weapons.] Edric. It is time I gave my brat a kiss, and showed myself With insolent composure. Well, young pup! [The child recoils, and clings to Edmund's hand.] Canute. Is this your son? [Aside.] Who shrinks away from him, As culprit from the touch of burning shares. It makes me hate the man. Edmund. Ah, Edric, you! To-day annuls offences, and you chose To serve the better master. Edric. With your pardon, I venture to declare I was your friend When I forsook you; I discerned the future Must be a compromise, and how to hasten This reconciling hour. Edmund. My ears are shut. [To Canute.] Brother, farewell. May we so grave the vows Which we have made deep in our memory, That God may call us faithful when we join Before His face hereafter. Canute. Let me take King Edmund to his boat. Edmund. A gracious offer. Thororin. Hateful to see him by his enemy, In this flat place, amid rank grass, and mud, And sated, yellow lilies. Edmund [to the child]. Come, my boy. Child. Look, uncle Edmund, at the bulrushes; How huge they stand. Edmund. Here is a goodly spike; I'll cut it down, and arm you with a lance. Child. My father gives me weapons; let it drop. Edmund. Nay, grasp it like a man! This noble king Will think our little English boys are cravens, If a reed makes them tremble. Canute. Edric's child!â Not featured like his father. Edmund. In each trait His mother's gentle self. [To the child.] Now jump aboard. [To Canute.] Good-bye, this honour pleases me, so well I love my valiant compeer. I am staunch, Canute, when I may trust. Canute. Brother, farewell. [Exeunt Edmund, the child, and English.] A king in sooth, he looks imperial, And royal London owns him as her lord. Edric [stealing up behind] My liege, your eye moves wistfully across To Edmund's train: there cannot be two kings; There shall not. Canute. Edric, put no evil thoughts Into my heart. He is a goodly man, This Edmund, sworn my brother; in his robe I stand. Edric. Invested in his majesty? Canute. For I have none to give him in exchange. How grew he thus? His father was a fool. Edric. His step-dame counts him as her enemy; Your crown were well established, she at home Once more in her old place. Canute. I feel the time Is come to knot our passion. Seek her presence, Ask her by all she loves in England, all She covets, by her solitude, her beauty, Wreathless and disenthroned, to cross the sea, And take back everything. Edric. A husband, yes; But her old kingdom also? Canute. Thororin, Carry this borrowed cloak; it fits me ill. Edric. It hampers you; it is too large. Canute. His arms,â Rid me of all. And half the land is mine: I am not king to eastward and to south, And that clear ocean-marge my father's right, And heritage by conquest shall be his? [Pacing apart.] How if I whisper murder to this vile, Mean-hearted alderman? . . . My word, my oath! If that great lady would come back, she is So fearful an enchantress, might I take her To wifeâthen, as the lucky figure-head, That speeds the sea-king to his victory, She would ensure me monarch absolute. I noted how she kept her smile alit When she was thwartedâand her ancient hate For Edmund! But with him my faith is sworn. [Turning.] Why do you cast your leg along that willow, As if to ponder, Edric? Edric. I would sleep, And dream your dreams. Canute. What? Edric. Nay, your face knows all. Canute. Where is that woman? Thororin. When she saw you leave Edmund for Edric's company, she bounded, And plucked the grass, and threw it on the stream, And turned home full of smiles. Canute. I almost think I hate this river-bed. Quick, ferryman! We'll pass these segs and flowering rushes by, And reach the stable pastures. Edric, come; Brown-study wastes your time. Edric. At my good pleasure. Thanks, thanks! Canute [to Thororin]. My bard, be ready with your harp; I need the sound of seas and cataracts. [Exit, with his followers.] Edric. As for me, I will just look about. Providence will direct me. I am lazy; I must have leisure, and to plot murders is a real toil to the brain. Yon heron drops by instinct his long neck into the water, when the fish is under his bill. Meanwhile he is contemplative. But the Old Lady will never rest till she has King Edmund's head in a charger. Though it be fine sport to inveigle him, the decoy-duck is not yet found. There is no chance of my luring him into a gin; and his kinsfolk and acquaintance, followers, friends, sister, wife, nephew, all dote on him. I have it!ânice, tame, and such an innocent. Eh, the lad can draw him to the cage. But slow, slow, my sludge-river; we need time. Scene III. The Danish quarters at Northampton. Enter Canute and Emma. A crowd of Normans and Danes is seen retiring. Emma seats herself in the royal chair. Canute stands abashed before her. Emma. And now we are together.âO my king, Is it not I that crowned thee? Streona, Whom I, in all things, have the shaping of, Hath thrice at my command waylaid the life Of Edmund, thine arch-enemy. He drew The English from their leader, left thee lord, And victor of the field. Did I not first See thee in London, at the siege? We took Counsel together, you and I apart; That day we settled kingdoms. Dear my lord, Now tell me wherefore thou would'st mate with me, Who am a wife, and mother of young kings, To whom the crown upon this brow is but A jewel repossessed, who must enact The past in all things, unto whom you can Reveal no wonder, give no morning gift I shall not smile at as familiar? Say, My handsome Dane, my sea-king, O my love, Bright as the prow-head of thy fairest fleets, Why did you choose me, when Duke Richard's girls, My brother's children, stitch their broidery, And sigh for lovers,âwhy? Am I not old, The ancient lady of these realms, and thou A rank invader, who hast exiled me, Distressed my husband, driven out my bairns, Ravaged my lands? There should be enmity Between us. Wherefore dost thou bring me here, Where naturally, from long habitude, I take the throne, as grand-dame by the fire Her honoured corner in the ingle-nook? What wilt thou with me, young barbarian, Who with so many wiles of courtesy Hast brought me over seas? The rumour is Thou wilt espouse me,âif for policy, Thou'lt rue it; if, Canute, it be for love. . . . Why would'st thou wed me? Canute. Lady, I have lived A ruthless warrior, but love the things Of peace and order. I have slain, and burnt, And mutilated, and have loathed myself, Yea, loathed the savagery. I would restore To England all her holy usages, Her laws, her Church, the treasures of her shrines, And, chief, the lady who has gemmed her crown, Her ever-honoured Lady Elfgifu. Emma [aside]. It is not then my beauty.âWhy, there is, I hear, another Elfgifu, the child Of murdered Aldhelm. Thou hast sons by her. Oh, tell me, are they like thee? Do they stamp In spring's eternity thy radiant brows; Is there young kingship in them? I have children So like their father, I have flung them off, For they recall the great misgovernance Of Ethelred the Redeless past the term Of my maternal patience. I am true In marriage, fair usurper. My two lads Will bear the characters of Cerdic's line, If they inherit. But this Elfgifu, The lady of Northampton, speak of her. Say, will you cast away the things she calls Your sons, and trust the future sole to me, Who, for your sake, relinquish all my right In well-begotten Edward and the young Alfred his brother? What of Elfgifu? You hesitate. Canute. Her name shall be forgotten; Her boys shall rule the far, barbarian lands; But for this England, that I love as mine, I will beget, lady, a kingly son, And you shall be his mother. Emma [sobbing]. Oh, my lord, I would I could unearth the buried past, To look it in the face and mock at it, Then fling it out as refuse. I, for you, Do so obliterate my loathÃ¨d days; They are dark to me, imageless, unknown, As the nine months before I saw the light, And I in heart a virgin come to you, A queenly virgin, Gem of Normandyâ So say the writers. Dost thou find it so? Canute, had I been ta'en thy spoil in war, How had'st thou served me? Had'st thou said, She's fair, But worn, I'll give her to my eldest chief; And turned to some soft, dimpled child, with eyes That stare at love as at a pageantry, That awes and dulls them; or, more circumspect, Had'st thou espoused me, and with Elfgifu Spent thy unlawful hours? Canute. Had'st thou been brought In all thy dazzling beauty to my knees, I had not given thee thy liberty; I had commanded thou should'st braid thy hair In wifely coronets; and thou with me Had'st made strong covenant thou would'st keep faith Till death should part us. Emma. When I bear a boyâ As doubt not this my joy in thee shall take Its form in flesh, that thou may'st see how deep It enters in my nature, spite my years;â When our young Dane is born, thou wilt confer On him all English royalties? Canute [throwing himself at her feet and clasping her hand]. All, all. Yet, my enchanting queen, see that he show Some traces of his mother. If you crave That I should dote on him, he must not be A simple warrior, but of courtly grace, Compelling charm, accomplished in all arts, Loving the harp, a gentle-mannered king, Lavish to learning. Emma. Mother to a monk! Is child-bed labour for the tonsure? Whew! My Danish son shall war, burn, ravage, slay, Never break faith, never buy off with gold His country's enemies, despise all guile, And, like a man, sin, harry, and pursue, Till all is under foot. Canute. Then must you give A daughter to me, that these clear, keen eyes A second time subdue a conqueror, And give us broad dominion. Noble lady, How bountiful and blessÃ¨d you must be, Thus to forget my many injuries, And give me promise of an empire, rich In heirs and kingdoms,ârich to me in this [passionately embracing her], My Norman gem, Emma, my Elfgifu. My stately England. Come, thou art my queen. Emma. And beautiful? Canute [drawing back]. You must not sting my blood. Oh, you will learn.âI struggle with my awe; I have known sack and pillage. Should I take you As a man takes the woman he desiresâ I cannot speak. Mine, mine! Emma. You are afraid To touch me. What, you tremble! Canute. Emma, think! I hold back by the jaws a savageness Of inbred nature. And a fear of shame, Of uttering dishonour to my love, My worship of you, makes me almost stone, And courteous like a host. You should not ask me If you are beautiful. All charms of earth, All that draws waves to shore, all influence Of stars or sun are in your face, and quiver In me as I behold it. Emma. You should woo Trusting my courage. Speak to me of fear In loveâ Canute. The taunt is perilous. Emma. As well Face a great warrior with dissuasive words: We will not meet; we are not matched in skill. From stripling's mouth such words are vanity, They show the arrant craven. Canute. For your sake I wrestled to become a Christian lover; You challenge my fierce past; you have no mercy. I'm made of primal stuff. You do not know. Emma. My heart is like the magnet, unalarmed At its completest triumph. Canute. Cruel queen, You go the way to make me cold with terror, And powerless to approach you. Give your voice Its softest resonance; 'twill win me back To love, to warmth, and confidence. O Emma, It was your sovereign culture, and your tones, Almost religious in their loveliness, That bound my passion to you. Emma. Ah, forgive. I glory in your mettle, in the flash Of bright desire that hurries from your eyes. Canute, I have been mated with a creature Who took my favours with a weary face, Whose hands were soft, whose lips were treacherous. It injures me to think of him; he's naught. In you I greet a manâwhose sex stands up Within him, ruling every element; 'Tis captain of his body. When 'tis so, And those who wed us bear the virile stamp, What can we do but worship? Canute. Nay, my part Is to revere. I ponder on your grace, Your state in movement: why, your very smile Tames like a lyre. Great lady, shall my love Be sacrilegious? I have seen them burn The lovely missals in the libraries, And a hot flush has come into my face; 'Twas all that they could do with them, but thereâ The pictures, and the story, the bright words Of Godâall wasted: let me be your scholar, Instruct me, make me worshipful, be patient, And you will fashion me a king so great That you yourself shall tremble at my fame; For I will raise an empire and excel In every princely art. I have ambition, But there is something that I lack that sways The conduct of the world. That hour we met At London, how I loved to watch your face Wrinkling in state-craft, and in policy So subtle 'mid the blundering warriors! I could not let the beauty simply stir Desire, that may redeem the negligence Of my untempered youth, raise me to honour, Benignity, and wisdom. Emma. But the toil! One must not dim these glittering, blue eyes With the thick-lettered pages. Woo me, woo! Be amorous; a woman best imparts Her knowledge and her mysteries to one Adoringly receptive. Ahâthe Redeless Had not been christened so, had he relied On my illuming sense, my intellect, My temper, and discretion. All are yours, So you will be my lover. Canute. Now I feel Strength to found kingdoms. Emma [embracing him]. For thou art a king. Scene IV. A dimly-lighted room; in a smaller room, the child sleeping. Enter Edith. Edith. They bound me to a traitor and a churl, And yet my grandsire had eight under-kings For vassals. He will weary of me soon, And I at Romsey, or some royal house, Shall dwell where there is diligence and peace. How beautiful this loneliness! It seems, At balmy evening, like that holy time Spent in the cloister, with this differenceâ My son lies in my sight; and I who ever Have loved men's souls, and prayed for their redemption,â But coldly, as God loved the world before The Bethlehem Babe lay in His cradle,ânow Faint in my importunity to save. For I have learnt how terrible the strength Of evil, and how great infirmity Besets soft, striving natures. When I kneel And offer supplication for the child, I feel him press and vibrate in the chords O' my inmost being. Ghostly premonitions Enhance my restless care and terror, portents No stretch of happy days could quite expunge: For I had vision of him, ere his birth, Lifting a gory hand half-full of flowers; It seemed while he lay slumbering on my knee, One came and whispered to him, and he laughed, And did not know me any more. I shudder When his remorseless father forces him To lash his favourite hound, or blind the falcon He cherished from the nest. A messenger Says Edric comes to-night; and I have known The child turn cold, yea, stammer, and tell lies If he but heard his footfall on the stairs. There is one way to save him; as he sleeps Gently to part him from his enemies: I have so often tried, but he will lie With soft, wide lips, as when I suckled him, And he fell dreaming from the breast. Alas! He never has outgrown his infancy. How I must pray! [Enter Edric, unperceived.] Edric. She looks a lady born, And I am proud to own her; slender hands, And hair down to the knees! Her eyes are fresh With constant tears,âa dew that shall not dry,â And the thin, curving lips are beautiful, Though worn with ceaseless prayers. My pretty saint! I love her, and must now, in jealousy, Purge her of earthly passion. Will she yield To the proposal I shall make to-night? How long ago she would have lost her wits, Save for the chapel and confessional! [Edith perceives him, and starts back.] Edith, sit down by me. I ride at dawn, And need some hours of rest. Watch by my couch, And waken me at midnight, when I start For Edmund's quarters; for your brother sends A chamberlain to beg that he may borrow Our Alfgarâa month's play and bed-fellow; And the request is opportune. My king Is sick of semi-governance. I know An easy death to keep the murderer Clean of suspicion;âa few, pregnant words To our meek offspring, and, without offence, Canute is well-established on his throne, And heavily my debtor. You are mute; My plan commends itself? Edith. If it must be, Why did you tell me of it? Edric. To bespeak Heaven's blessing on the scheme and execution. Give me a kiss;âa face of ivory To match yon crucifix. Now get within. [Motioning to the child's room. Exit Edith.] Unearthly creature! She will win forgiveness Of my vile sin before it is committed; While Edmund lies at peace upon his bed, She will have prayed me guiltless of his murder. She was revolted when I married her By my dull lewdness; in our wedded hours, As I unfolded to her my atrocious And unimagined culpability, She grew the guardian angel of my spirit; And now, asleep or waking, I am certain Of pardon for my most appalling crimes, And, trusting to her saintly vigilance, Can close my eyes and fall asleep without A pater-noster. [Lies downâcloses his eyes.] [Re-enter Edith, with a dagger.] Edith. I will not suborn Any poor, guilty wretch to do the deed, But ope for him myself the door of Hell, And close it on the instant. And the childâ This is an easy deed, and, unforbidden, I lift my arm to slay. His time is come! [She strikes his breast, and swoons. He rises in armour, unhurt.] Edric. A simple scratch, but sly and treacherous; She must not go unpunished. How to hurt? If I should leave her thus, she will wake dazed, And stutter forth my deed. By heaven, such hate Comes on me I could kill her.âWhat, revived! You woke me roughly, and an hour too soon. Now we can talk of my design. Edith. Oh, if Edmund must dieâ As there may be state reasons, do it thusâ Let him not suffer. You had never known. Take, take the sword. Edric. Here is my instrument. [Turning to the child, who watches from his bed.] Awake! Ha, ha, awake! What, sirrah, staring? You have not slept. Get ready for a journey. You watched, I know it by your face, the way Your mother raised her arm to murder me. Get up; I want you to do that again On uncle Edmund, when he lies asleep. I'll teach you. [The child trembles, and dresses himself, his eyes fixed on his mother. Edric puts a dagger in his bosom.] Edith. There are voicesâit begins. God! God! the dagger gleams from out his vest, And his white, witless eyes are fixed on me; There is no speech upon his lips, he wanders As the fiend to and fro. Come to me, Alfgar; I cannot lift myself. My boy, be brave, Put that way [pointing to the dagger], and though he torture you. . . . O God! I cannot speak, it grows confused; I feel the fetters on my brain struck off. No matter, you can play about the same; I feel so happy. Edric. He shall promise me Entire obedience. If he disobey, He knows his punishment: I blind his eyes, And leave him shut up in the dark for ever. [The child utters a wild scream.] Edith. Ah, ah! an idiot laugh. How pleasantly He'll spend the days, and mutter in the grass. 'Tis sweet as death, this madness. Up and down I' the sunshine, and to laugh the whole long day. Child. I could not see to do it! Edith. No; he's blind! Give me the dagger. I am free at lastâ Free, free. And now I'll tell you something strange; I never shall remember any more. Come, we are play-fellows, and you must hide In the deep water. None will find you there, Down in the moat, by the neglected wellâ The sedges keep a-rocking. [She seizes the child, and sways to and fro with him in her arms.] Though he's drowsy, I cannot close his eyes; but never mind, We are quite happy. [Edric snatches the child, and strikes Edith down.] Child. Father, let us go: I cannot bear the feel of her,âher arms Are snakyâtake me where it must be done: I will not flinch Edric [setting the child before him]. With this young innocent To cloak my purpose, I will set aside The royal line, and push up to the throne. [Glancing at Edith.] Will it not gall her? I foresaw this raving, And brought a nun to take her to her cell At Malmesbury; after my sore discipline, The cordials of religion. [To the child.] Come along. [Exit, with the child.] [Edith rises, and looks carefully round the room.] Edith. An orphan! I shall find him hereabouts. They said I must go searching in the tombs; But there are madmen in the rocks, and one Has struck me on the brow. A pretty boy, And his poor mother crying. I am fearful That she has lost her wits. I will be bold, And face the peril. Prioress. Lady, come with me. Edith. No, no! that is the way to Paradise; I will not be your dupe. If you can lead To the black moat, by the neglected well, Down in the rushes, I will whisper you Where he is hidden. Softly step along. [Exeunt.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. A room on the northern bank of the Thames, overlooking the Danish fleet. Enter Canute. Canute. Sunset! The air is ominous. I muse On Danish majesty, my splendid fleet, England's great city-river, and my Ravens Flapping across; yet by King Edmund's favour I winter in the Thames. [Enter Thororin.] O Thororin, Be near me, play to me; I am beset By terrible temptations. Thororin. English priests Should teach you their religion; or your lady, Your Christian queen, can she not give instruction, And settle you in conduct? We are friends, Love binds us; she is satisfied to listen Hour after hour to the triumphant verse I sang when you were pagan. Look at her! [Emma and Edric are seen landing.] She gives her hand to Streona. Confess Your misery to that fine, goading face, And it will cure despondency. [Thororin withdraws as Emma and Edric approach.] Canute. He hurts Deep, deep,âfor he has visions, and should know That I was crying out in mortal pain For divination, insight, such as poets Should draw from open gazing on the world. What means my queen? Although her lips are rigid, A stormy secret plays about her brows, And, passing Edric's hand, she speeds to me, Urgent, despotic. Emma. King of England, hail! My all-possessing, worshipful, young lord. Ah, ah, a regal flush! Wilt thou to London? It is an air I love. Come, a behaviour Less frank in its disclosures; feign surprise! Canute. What means this greeting? Edmund is not dead? Emma. All, all his lands are joined this day to yours; I give you half a kingdom, for you took me Without a dowry. Canute. Did he die by nature? His cheek was withered when I saw him last; Six battles had he fought, and swept like fire Now here, now there, calling slow country-folk To gather to his wars. A noble ruler! [To Edric.] He died at peace,âwith housel? Edric. What a question! When I sit down to feast, I know a sheep Has bled for my repast. Canute [seizing Edric]. What, you have slain Your very lord, who pardoned you your vileness, Who trusted you? Edric. Ay, ay, he was a fool; He trusted everybody, even you; He treated you like one of the old stock, Who knew the strength of covenant. [Canute relaxes his hold.] We settled At Olney I should do this bit of work; And now perform your part; the Mercian earldom, And that respect you pay a man who serves At some great crisis! Canute. Caitiff, did I give you A word or a command that day I swore? Edric. The solemn oaths were all for Edmund's ears; With me connivance was enough. Come, come, No temper! There is sunset on the towers Of London; all those gilded battlements Are yours, and no suspicion: in a fit Of lunacy my lad, while bedfellow To his good uncle, stabbed him as he slept. The childish actor had been ably prompted, And terror made him perfect at the art; His guilt is palpable. He roams the fields, A jabbering little devil, full of secrets To make Beelzebub an eaves-dropper. [Aside.] I waste my breath; a change is on his features. I know this quiet; it arrests the sense, Like the appeasing movement of a storm, That paralyses, ere it devastate. Best let her feel its fury. [Turns to Emma, who remains breathlessly staring at Canute.] 'Tis a sickness Needs the domestic touch; I take my leave. When it is opportune recall my service, Urge my desert. Canute. I fear to deal the blow, And make a lightning end. I would call forth My feasting jarlsâthey would bespatter him With such disgraces, ridicule, and flaunts, That he would die, unstruck, of countless gibes, And feel by prophecy his corpse would serve For next day's merriment. [Seizing Edric suddenly.] Thou hast offended Beyond the bounds of nature, and the darkness Shall never cover thee; for thee no grave, But infinite exposure in the sun; Corruption blazon thee the thing thou art, Abhorred and dissolute! [Canute strangles Edric, flings his body into the stream, and gazes out.] Emma. To look at it The male's fierce nature in its nakedness, With passions that dumb creatures in their lairs Conceive in solitude! How break it in? Wild as the waters that engulfed the world, It rages in its hour of dominance, And all familiar outlines are destroyed; There is no sky, no comfort, no relief, No streak in the great wilderness. O God, Thou gavest us our beauty and our guile To win these creatures. I will try a touch,â 'Tis softer than the voice, more powerful. Canute. I teem with memory. Old Gorm would glare Above his cupâWhose hand is this? Emma. My king, You are a murderer. Canute. I slew him not, The great lord Edmund; if indeed I slew, I loved his kingdom, loved his people, all The other side, the hills beyond the stream; I loved him yea, I hugged him to my heart, I felt him royal. Emma. O Canute, you murdered The faithful Edric. Canute. God what I have done Is bloody round my brain; I cannot see. I'm dazed to find my wife, and this close room Behind me, when I leave the boundless wind, And my far childhood. Emma. Spend your senseless wrath On me, your Emma, who exalted you To your most dear ambition. Yet you slew The faithful servant who fulfilled the deed. Canute. Did you not lay a hand on me and weep? Emma. He love'd you trulyâas your queen doth love, And therefore I must weep him. Did you fear Alfred, my eldest born of Ethelred, I would myself with my own hands destroy His sight, his life, whatever you should crave; For all that derogates from your estate Is fitted for destruction. Canute [unheeding]. Is it thus That Hell begins? and can God make damnation With just a little shifting of the days? When me the live hour brings its transient tale, I look it in the face: but shall the past Ride down and meet me on the open plain? Can nothing grow obscure,âthe mighty figure, Erect and kindly,âthe reproachful glance On skulking Edric? Am I forced to feel Again the pressure of the great, warm hands, And mutter words of feigning amity? Nay, crowd the English people on the bank, Unveil the hypocrite, call me by names Shall strip me bare of majestyâa coward, A cunning, sleek barbarian. Supreme Above me thou shalt sit a king and judgeâ Ah, I bethink me there are tears and prayers, And drops of blood fall from the crucifix, Or the great agony would overcome, And I should fail of penitence; it works Like death within me. Emma. Desolate, abandoned! Oh, I must rally him.âMy dearest lord, Do not grow pale as one in guiltiness. Never till now have I beheld you blench. The deed was my conception; you are free. I could not suffer you a demi-king, Nor make you present of a demi-heir; Therefore I ordered Edmund should be slain; I gave command upon our marriage day, And Edric nodded. Canute [unheeling]. I have seen a fox Steal round a yard to snatch; a prowling dog Creep for a bone. Ah, Edric, you and I Are mates, the fiends will couple us in hell, To hunt down the unwary. I repent I plunged you in the cold;âmy flaming cheek Must bear the shame, while cool oblivion Washes you o'er and o'er. Emma. He sickens me With his dull raving.âMy exceeding love Moved me to hint to Edric . . . Canute [leaping to the window]. Has he sunk? The moon has spread a sheet upon the stream, And hidden all that's fatal. Treacheryâ Ay, here, and my own act. Emma. He is intent On self-reproach and bitterness. Canute. The stars Have steadfast faces, and prefix our doom; It is the wandering comets lead astray With unsteered courses. What is permanent Is god-like, and the shifty things a flaw And a discredit to the universe. Heaven hath so honoured man that he can bring His word to pass, and make a feeble promise, A breath, and an endeavour, more assured Than rise or set of sun. That majesty Being disowned, there is no use in kings, No purpose to accomplish. [Turning to Emma.] Edmund's sons Shall have their portion; I can make amends. But that's not large enough! I would be rid Of degradation, of the filching nature, The vilenÃ©ss in the blood. Emma [aside]. God pardon me! Until I hear that Edmund's babes are slain, I have no strength for travail.âOh, I faint. 'Twas thoughtless 'fore a woman in my state To hack and murder. You are terrible; Your wrath, I fear, has cost your land an heir. For him, for you, I sinned. Canute, I die; Pardon and pray for me. Canute. She's deadly white. O Lady, have I hurt you? Emma. Ay, to death. A mailed voice!âI am used to minstrel's tones; And the reproach cut. I shall surely die Barren and cursed, but on my failing knees I pray you nurse these children as your own, Adopt them both, and for your unborn babe Harbour no guilty thought. Canute. You madden me. Emma, you cannot meanâ Emma. Nay, give my child A third of your possessions, be untrue To your great, bridal oath. What is a woman, A mother, that your word to her should bind, Though sealed with bridegroom's kisses. At my knees You swore such thingsâa promise that the fruit Of our embrace should own as heritage All English royalties. Be false, dear king, Add broken vows to deeds of faithlessness, And take advantage of my sex; all men Write truth to wives and maidens on a tablet Of running water. They are Edmund's sons; And you repent. Canute. My lot is tied to yours, Fell tigress, temptress. Would you have your den Bloody with slaughtered babes? Emma. I cannot bear The sight of blood, the talk of butchery. These children, let me never hear their names; But bring me word they are not in the land. We have removed the trouble of two kings; No rival princes should encumber us; For if you hold to the legitimate And lawful issue, there are royal lads, The two I pushed back from the throne to set My young usurper there. I'd rather see The boys I bore, than these step-grandchildren, Mounting my daÃ¯s-steps. I must entreat You keep good faith with me. Canute. You hold me bound To that wild oath? Emma. Your lips were hot and ready; Your hands embraced my fingers. Ah, but then I had not stooped from my great widowhood. I was so amorous, I forgot my lover Was not of gentle mould; like kingly Edmund, I trusted the barbarian. Ay, strike me! Your viking humour is not void of charm. King Ethelred was sorry oftentimes, Exceeding sorry, he had bribed the Danes; A while ago you brought him to my mind; Do not be sorry. . . Canute. Have you no remorse? Emma. That you are England's king? Impossible! Go, and prevent mischance. Remove these babes, All will be well. Canute. They never shall be slain, But harboured safely where I cannot lay My cruel hands about them. Over-sea, Olaf, my brother, shall be foster nurse; You shall not look on them [starting up]. I will give orders They presently set sail. Emma [intercepting him]. King Edmund's widow May trust your tenderness; I bow a victim To your most killing hate. How opportune The river flows beneath! I cannot live, Yet, queenly, choose the manner of my death. Lift me, my lord, once more into your arms, Then fling me from you. [He pushes her away, and she falls.] Canute. God! no more! temptation! Let me not touch you, for my pulses dance With murderous fever. All my promises I will perform, and then I shall breathe free To pour on you the measure of my hate, To punish, to divorce you. [Exit.] Emma. Gone His wrath Has left me smittenâsuch huge, manly rage; I'm shaken to the heart. So it should be. One cannot love a man whose hands show not As clearly they were made to deal stout blows, As his smooth lips for kisses' tender use. But yet my child,âhe should not peril him,â And, oh, the hatred in his quivering breath As he forsook me. I have suffered treatment Worthy of lamentation, and a sea Heaves at my bosom; but I loose no weeping. Without him all is tearless, desperate; I have a headlong wish to die. Alas! We cannot look each other in the face, When there is jar between us; so accursed Are quarrels of true love. I do not doubt But my inextricable charm will keep This boy in adoration. I will rest me Upon our marriage-bed, on the dear couch, Till I have strength, and beauty soothed enough Simply to rise and draw him to my feet. [Exit.] Scene II. The same; later. Enter Canute. Canute. She dared not wait my coming, and shall look No more upon my face.âA vacancy, A blank! that scarf left trailing on the floor, A shred too of her robe,âI must have trampled, Have hurt her, as I thrust her off. A shred, A tag, and is it thus that women suffer? We can inflict so little on such natures; We cannot make reprisals. Slavish tears For Edric, and,âO Hel!âa bloody gleam Across her eyes, when I proclaimed the rights Of Edmund's children. I am cut adrift, Far, far from the great, civilizing God,â Dull, speechless, unappraised. [A voice singing.] Is that a child At babble with his vespers?âSilver sweet! It minds me of the holy brotherhood, Chanting adown the banks. As yesterday I see all clear, how as they moved they chanted, And made a mute procession in the stream. [Gazing abstractedly on the water.] Merrily sang the monks of Ely, As Canute the king passed by. Row to the shore, knights, said the king, And let us hear these Churchmen sing. Still are they singing? It was Candlemas, My queen sat splendid at the prow and listened With heaving breast. 'Twas then the passion seized me To emulate, to let her know my ear Had common pleasure with her, and I trilled The story out. The look she turned on me! The choir shall sing this music. I resolved In the glory of the verse to civilize My blood, to sweeten it, to give it law, To curb my wild thoughts with the rein of metre. Row to the shore! So pleasantly it ran, A ripple on the wave. I grew ambitious To be a scholar like King Alfred, gather Wise men about me, in myself possess A treasure, an enchantment. For an instant I looked round royally, and felt a king. The abbey-chant, the stream, the meadow-land, The willows glimmering in the sun;âa poet Wins things to come so close. A plash, a gurgle! There's a black memory for the river now; And hark! strange, solemn, Latin words that toll, And move on slowly to me. . . . Up the stair.â Without the door. A wail, a litany! [Enter Child singing.] Child. Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam misericordiam tuam; Et secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarum, dele iniquitatem meam. Canute. How perfectly he sings the music! Child, Who art thou with that voice, those dying cheeks? Art thou an angel sent to wring my heart, Or is it mortal woe? Thine arms are full. Child. Green, country herbs, they say, will staunch a wound; And I have run about the fields and gathered Those I could catch up quickly:âfor the blood Was leaping all the while. But here is clary, The blessÃ¨d thistle, yarrow, sicklewort, And all-heal red as gore. I knew a wood So dark and cool, I crept for lily-leaves; Then it grew lonely, and I lost the way. But, oh, you must not beat me; it is done. Father, I stabbed him, throw away the whip! Now God will scourge me. So I plucked the flowers, And sang for mercy in the holy words Priest Sampson taught me, Miserere! Canute. This Is Edric's child, the little murderer, Who did my deed of treason. Edmund, turn Those trustful eyes from off me. Child. Take me back. He will be dead . . . He fell, O father, fell, And when I put my cheek against his side, Gave a great pant. Let's pray for him together. Can you sing Miserere? For I did it, And then he looked . . . Once in the ivy-tod I caught an owl, and hurt its wing. 'Twas so He looked. Oh, quickly tell me where he liesâ Next room? or down the passage? Do you know He was my uncle, and was kissing me, One, two, three, on my head. Canute. Cease! From these lips, White, childish penitents, how awful sounds The wild avowal of their treachery. Child, it was I who struck your uncle's side, Who falsely kissed him; it was I who set Your father on this wickedness; 'twas I Who drove your frantic innocence to work The sin of my conception. Can you learn That I alone am guilty, and God's wrath Will visit me with judgment? Child. Come along, And take me where he is. How can I go? I do not know the path or time of day. The leaves are fading. Can the blood flow long Before it kills? I saw it spirit and jump; I could not see it now. I ran and ran . . . Perchance I stayed too long about the fields. 'Tis dark; no trees and hedges. He is gone, And I am damned for ever; the fresh herbs Could once have saved me. Canute. He is chill and fainting; Give me these hands. Child. I am not much afraid. Before I struck at him my skin was hot; Now dew is falling on me; it is cool. Let me lie in your arms where I can look Up at the sky. There's some one . . . and he grows So kindly. Oh, he smiles down all the way, Quite golden in my eyes. Canute. He sees the moon. How pale and cold he's growing! All the flowers Are slipping down. I cannot bear his weight. 'Tis condemnation. There is just a spot Here on his garment, one bright drop of blood, Sprinkling his spirit; he is saved; on him It is the very mark of Christ; on me The blot that makes illegible my name I' the book of life. Child. If I should fall asleep, It will not matter, for I could not see The healing plants by night; besides my eyes Will open wide at morning. I must hold The blessÃ¨d thistle in my hand, and pray; And God may so forgive me. Miserere! Canute. The child is dying on my breast. He closes His frightened eyes; the notes are on his lips, His arm still round my shoulder. Sharply flows The Thames now he is dead; the rush, the hum, Are like a conscience haunting me without. I cannot bear it. I will fling him forth To the engulfing river, and forget him. Rank, pagan impulse! I would learn the prayer, Recall the gracious song,âand stormy sagas Come hurtling through my brain. I am a stranger To our sweet Saviour Christ; I cannot pray; I love the slaughter of my enemies, And to exact full vengeance. Little one, Thou shalt have fair, white sere-cloth, and a circlet Of purest gold. Now that I look on thee, It grows soft in my heart as when they chanted Across the stream.âCanute the king passed by, And listened.âThey shall sing about thy grave. [He bows himself over the child and weeps.] Scene III. Malmesbury. The Orchardâmoonlight. Edith by a pool. Edith. They must not dress me like a penitent . . . It was for kindness. White, white up in heaven, And glist'ring: how it sails about the sky; And I am for the water. I will do 'tâ They put it on me as a dreadful task To pull him out. Oh, here are golden flowers; I will step softly in . . . but at the roots It's black and treacherousâfoul iris-bed. Back, back! I cannot bear the filth. O Edric, I will have courage, yea, I will be damned, Damned for your sake. When it grows dark again, I'll fling down in the water. For a little . . . Oh, I will come to you, I know my serviceâ But just to watch the silver in the clouds, Where there is muffled music. Gloria! It's full through all the heavens, and the child Sings clearer than the rest. How beautiful To watch him from so very far away. I loiter. I came down to the deep pool To get damnation; they shall never say That I deserted him, who am his wife. How he has drawn me to him from the hour He humbled me. I think he grows more strong Now he is with the devils, and will bring A host of them to carry me away. No, no! 'Tis I myself must enter it; For 'tis obedience that shall break her in, He said, I will not force her. Now 'tis dark, And I shall stumble on the choking rushes, If I should try to drown. Who walks the orchard, Weeping so bitterly? Elgiva. O England, England, Dost feel it at thy heart, thou hast no king? Ah me, and no avenger? The twin boys I bore, that should have rid thee of thy tyrant, Rock on the chilly sea: such little ones, Cast forth without a nurse. O pitiless! We do not keep a fire where no one comes; I'm lonely, and the ashes in my blood Tell of such desolation. I have lost My twain, and all my kindnessâ Edith. Lady, lady, 'Tis quiet; you can rock a child to sleep Down there, if that's your meaning. Come along. Elgiva. It is his sister Edith, who has had Strange woe; whose little son . . . O God! O Heaven! She stands there from whose body came the thing That widowed me. So tall she is and whiteâ The fountain of my tears. Edith. I want your hand To do it with. I held an iris-leafâ It flashed like a drowned sword, and then I cried A ghost! The moonlight laughed so merrily. But I will say the Scripture over: Wives, Obey your husbands. He is hidden there, Under the cresses. Elgiva [aside]. She is surely mad. I'll be an angry keeper, and my mood Gives me a touch of cruelty.âStand still. How dare you stir? Edith. It is all learnt by heart; It must be done; he watches all the while, Though out of sight. Elgiva. Come back to me. Obey! Edith. Ah, now you know the wordâobey! Yes, yes. I will do all you tell me. Elgiva. Then walk back. [Aside] O God, that I should be so harsh! She fixes Such waiting eyes upon me, timorous, Yet full of noble candour, Edmund's eyes, That could not learn suspicion.âCome away; Sit on the bank. She does it like a child. A child! I fill with tenderness: God sends her To keep my heart a mother's. How it throbs Against her nestling forehead! Edith. I am happy; You said I must not drown. Indeed 'twas foul, And I am fond of linen newly washed I mean in shallow water, where the pebbles Are clear and burnished . . . forâyou do not knowâ I felt that I was making me a harlot To perish with him. Say it over to me, Forbid it every hour and every day, Now, and each moment! Save me by your voice, Lest the reeds have me, and the loathsomeness, The violating dregs. Elgiva. You shall not die; It is a great command; and mortal sin It were to disobey. Edith. Is that the word? I feel an impulse sucking me apart From this dear side, and yonderâ Elgiva. I am strong; You shall not go. Obey me. Edith. There it is! Your voice is living, his down there is dead; He could but catch me with the water plants; You hold me in your lap, and twine me round So firmly in your arms. Obey, obey! Just as you think it well for me. I know Why they have dressed me as a penitent; My feet are muddy; but my hair, you see, Is golden when I turn it to the moon, Quite clear and shining. Shall I tie it up The old way, like a crown? Faugh, it is damp; I thought I had not sinned. Elgiva. It is the dew Of autumn-eve, my dearest. You shall be My care, my child, my blessing. We will live Thus hand-in-hand, for we are sisters, both Beloved of Edmund. It was in this orchard His first kiss crowned my lips below the trees; Their buds were red: the apples now are fallen, The boughs no more possess them. Do I cry? But there is something calm as Paradise I' the climate of this weeping. All the night Is one blue home of stars, and I am certain Of a sweet sudden that my boys are safe In the far country, and will live at peace, And grow up with their father's spirit near. I think it is this crooning at my breast Makes me so blessÃ¨d; like the wood-dove's moan, Sorrow and comfort are both reconciled In this low music. She is sleeping half, And half complaining. Noble Edmund's sister, And England's royal princess! Edith. I have never Known all this joy since I was three years old. I go back in your arms through many days Till I can find that I lay warm like this, Taking no thought, my blood just like a prayer They chant to measured harmonies. Elgiva. She enters The life of heaven, though outside its door, And a mad nun at Malmesbury! I will lead her To my own cell; for the bland night is sending Its sleep to earth, and visiting her brain To heal all ache. My woman-child, my own. [Exeunt.] Scene IV. Glastonbury. Early morning. The burial-ground; beyond, the church, open, disclosing Edmund's tomb, by which Canute stands. Enter Archbishop Ethelnoth and a Monk. Monk. Doth the king still keep vigil? Ethelnoth. I have watched unseen through the whole night. Sometimes he would be restlessly pacing; and anon, he would hide his faceâdash his rosary to earth. But his great, fierce hands showed the wrestling. In the third watch a change came; his prayers were all said; he turned from the tomb, and looked up. Then he fell a musing, long, long. It was just when the day trembled, and he watched all the changes in the sky, like a child. After that he never moved till the bell sounded for matins. Monk. Monuments all about him, and he had no fear of the dead? Ethelnoth. Not the least: he looked often at the graves, with a kingly eye too. Monk. You think he is penitent? Ethelnoth. I would fain have questioned him: his face was so full of responses. But there was a privacy about it, kept me well in the shadow. Monk. This is curious. If he should have a great vision to recount! Did his brows shine? Ethelnoth. Well, to be honest, there is nothing in Scripture comparable with his aspect. The bright colour is come back to his cheeks; and his eyes burn again like stars. He looked sickly so long. Monk. Yes; and it is marvellous a night in the chapel should recover him. I could never live through it. There is so much that is supernatural. But he does not know how the corpses bloom about himâfresh as resurrection-morn; he has never seen a saint's coffin opened, nor breathed the fragrant, spiced air from the lips. He is back now at his prayers. Ethelnoth. And the sunlight of the dawn is over him. His head glows like an altar seized by God's descent. I must see now that he rests and has meat. He will suddenly hunger, and then no patience. It is the swoop of the falcon on the woodcock. Get within. [Exit Monk.] [To Canute.] I trust you have found peace and absolution? Canute. 'Tis for King Edmund that I kept the watch: I said the prayers, the great mulct for his soul; My task was ended long since in the dark. Ethelnoth. It should have kept you lowly on your knees Till dawn. A penanceâhave you learnt them all, The varied, slow, humiliating rites? Canute. 'Tis little that I know except the creed, And Pater-noster that Christ sang Himself, And taught to His disciples: seven prayers There are in that Divine one, and he sends To God a message touching every want A man may have, who sings it in his heart, As I above this tomb. Oh, I have deeply Foredone myself; but mercy hath been shown me, And I for ever shall hold fast in thought All this night's miracle. Ethelnoth. Confide the vision. You have an aspect most mysterious, As God had forced an entrance to your soul. Canute. O Ethelnoth, I have given up the keys of the city to Him. There is no warfare longer between us. They are wonderful Hands to fall into, and a wide world that is opening. I must be a pilgrim. Ethelnoth. Then you saw one call you to St. Peter's dome; or St. Joseph, who himself took the young Child to a new country, with his wanderer's staff pointed your route? Canute. No; 'tis the need of travel, That I may think. God is a law-giver, And in the mysteries of nature prints The characters of rule. All things with Him Are from a source, and of necessity As stern as that which makes corruption sequence To the slacked bonds of life. Ethelnoth. How shall you journey? Canute. Not by the seaâthat's pagan; by slow highways, Pausing at cities. Ethelnoth. This is worldly business, Of which your soul will get no benefit. Canute [pointing to the altar]. Are your eyes glutted with the treasure there? My breach of faith has opened intercourse 'Twixt me and heaven: we do not haggle now On the first point at issue. Oh, this large, Wide world of sorrowâ'tis as I had entered A kingdom. Let us out into the light. [Turning to the burial-ground.] Such very early morning, autumn-time, A rigour in the air; from the dark chapel How sharp the contrast!âgolden sycamores, The dew a filmy veil across the grass, The blue mist o' the orchard. 'Tis the moment When nature puts on immortality, Casting her mortal weeds, and this elation Springs from itself, a current in the air That hath no ripple. [Re-enter Monk: a procession passes.] From the Fount of God I have drunk and am refreshed. My Edmund's England Shall be no fleeting kingdom. Ethelnothâ[Exeunt into the Church, conversing, and finally joining the procession.] Monk. Why, he looks like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber. I will at once set this down. How he towers above the band of brethren! Heaven's favour is assuredly upon himâand so beautiful! He has the roses and lilies of a womanânot like brother Thurstan, with the great, red patches in his cheeks. But it's in the Scripturesâholiness always gets into the skin. My complexion is a poor witness to my sanctity. [Exit into the Church.] [Enter Emma into the burial-ground.] Emma. Love, love!âI'll learn it in the burial-ground; Love, love!âthey think that I come here to pray? Ay, as monks pace this path in orisons To be belovedâof God. What dost thou here, [Enter Thororin.] My Thororin, in this drear water-land, This isle of apple-orchards? Thou stand'st mute. I left thy noble Viking at the tomb Of Edmund, weeping; some vicissitude Has fallen on him; he is shrunk and shamed. Thororin. And changed to thee, my queen? Emma. Oh, Heaven severs More hearts than it unites. Thou art a poet, And hath he banished thee his company? Thororin. We two have stood together when the stars Shone straight down in the sea, and I have sped The ship with music fleeter than the wind. I will to sea; there I shall dream of him, Ah, there I shall recoverâ Emma. Thororin, Thou hast my queenly heart. I can disburthen Only to theeâa priest is judge of sin: Who cares for sin? Who would be healed of that? The hunger and the thirst about the heart The poet can assuage; he knows the truthâ That love is the religion, and the body But a poor pagan till it learn its rites. We were so happy: none should look on lovers; I' the world 'tis outrage, and on Heaven's part It spoils the privacy. Two souls alone With the blind sky and unrecording earth To witness themâthen there may be disclosures, Deep, amorous friendship; but with God to watchâ He's made all ill betwixt us. Thororin. I have lost The poet's joy, for in my Danish lord All Sagas were accomplished. He betrays Imagination, and the trust of song; He has befooled my dreams, and I will go. With me flies Gunhild; when she heard the king Was praying, with an altered countenance, She tossed her arms and cried, He is undone, No hope for Scandinavia, but his childâ And a beam crossed her forehead. Emma. She would bless My babe if she beheld him; he is featured Like Gorm, his father's lawless grandfather And stares out at the sea. Thororin. Yea, she spake true;â Our king is lost; last night I saw him shudder Passing my harp, and my resolve is taken. He shall not look upon the sacred creature, That never speaks save to proclaim its love. Withdraw your heart as I the instrument That has no music for him. Emma. Oh, to cease From loving is impossible. He's changed, I recognise it, but the man in him Endures; the tough love overlives these things; I could not quite forsake him. I will labour To found fair abbeys, and enrich the Church, Then, 'tis my last ambition, he will build A stately tomb for meâa marriage bed; For I shall lie and listen to his voice, Awake and trembling: he will talk of sin, And pray, and stumble in the Latin words, Till I shall laugh to hear him, but his thought Will be of a gold-haired and royal saint, Serene at God's right hand, and meet for worship. 'Twill please me, as I moulder at his knee, To know he has that picture, and that Emma Draws him o' nights to the moonlighted choir. You sing love overlives death: sing it loud In Norway! I will act it; I will feign. Thororin. Nay, be yourself, show you despise this doting, Show how ignoble is a reign of peace. This sleepy air is not for warriors; Rouse him to conquest; let him see your scorn. Emma. And alienate him so. Have you not learnt, My poet, love is the great, feigning art; Itself the desperate, deep reality That puts on all disguises? Feign to love, All living creatures crowd to jeer at you, Dead in dissimulation: be a lover, And all that your belovÃ¨d covets most You will become. Did my lord set his heart On gem, or missal, I would gratify His whim, and now saints are his admirationâ Thororin. O noble-featured queen, you cannot grow One of these petty women, with blank faces; Your brow gleams as the flashing, northern sky, And you will cease to charm him when you wear A stagnant, dull sobriety. [Re-enter Canute, Ethelnoth, and procession from the church. King and Archbishop walk apart.] Emma. He comes; Is he not beautiful, a very hero? To Norway! Spread his glory in the North! When the great battle-lust possesses him He will be perfect pagan. Oh, I love thee, For thou hast sung of that in all the world Most worthy of eternal chronicle, And endless iteration. Thororin. Come away! Let us not look on him. The bells and chanting Have thrust the homely sagas from his mind. Emma. O harp, that keeps him famous through the world, O Thororin, my poet, on thy brows I set my lips. Couple my name with his; Sing of our kingly bairn.âForget the restâ Sing of his glory, sing the conqueror. Thororin [scowling at Canute]. A tattling penitent! Oh, I will tell Great lies to make men tremble at thy name, And thou shalt burn and harry like the rest, The son of Swend, but fiercer in destruction. I will keep faith with thee; my harp shall never Know thy dishonour. Emma. Seven battlefields Thou hast to sing, and Edmund's overthrow. Farewell! [Exit Thororin; she watches Canute.] He doth not even look on me, There is a seeking passion in his face, He's thinking how he best can serve his God. Some faces never alter. [Ethelnoth advances to her.] Ethelnoth. Noble lady, What do you in the early morning air? Emma [aside]. He thinks I am so wrinkled and so stricken That I disfigure the young day? My beauty Shall dazzle and humiliate the monk, And thenâ[glances at Canute] 'Tis said you lived here as a boy. Archbishop, you have often paced this path Among the abbey dead,âI came here humbly To look for sepulture; my waning years Incline me earthward, as those stooping trees Bend their decaying branches to the ground. Ethelnoth. Daughter, these precints are not yet for you; There's summer on your features, and your hair Is radiant as Queen Guinevere's, whose bones Moulder beneath you. Emma [shuddering]. Have I found the grave Of Guinevere? Ethelnoth. Yes, lady, it was opened Six years agoâthe bloom still on her face, But dusty. Emma [kneeling]. Will you let me lie beside This lovely queen? Oh, deeper in the earth! [Flings herself on the ground.] I am an ageing woman:âmeet I die, And give him my wild soul to wanton with. [Canute passes near her.] God, he is cruel, with sharp instruments He's cutting at my heart. Ah, blessÃ¨d father, Did we twain walk together, we would found Such stately houses, for I love the Church; Yet oh!âit is my mortal sinâmy husband Is foremost in my heart. Ethelnoth. This reverie Hath been too much prolonged, he doth not notice His noble queen; she is a royal creature, Doubtless of great munificence. I'll bring This pair together. Emma. All my revenues, If you can make him penitent of this, His infamous neglect. [Ethelnoth walks apart with Canute.] In very truth, My heart will burst its banks from this contraction And pressure of my rage. I do not feign; The fury in me doth transgress the limits Of life's determined channels. [Exit Ethelnoth.] Canute [approaching.] Desolate! My lady, with her bright hair in the grass Untressed. Ah! you mistake; it was not here They laid the king we murdered. Emma. Here is buried Our Arthur, faultless monarch of the West, And Guinevere, his beauteous, wicked queen. Oh, give me leave my lord, to lie with her. Canute. You say that she was wicked. Emma. So am I. She had a heart too passionate, and beauty That bore no bloom save in the clime of love. We shall speak low together; she will prate Of Lancelot, but I shall say my husband Was my sole lover, and became a pilgrim: I lay a shrouded figure on the bed, When he returned. Canute. Emma, my precious queen, You make me stark with horror: for my soul I go to Rome; for I have wrought a deed So black, so diabolical, I shudder For hell by day and night. The time will come When it will be far better for us, far, Than all on middle earth, that we had ever Performed God's will, and very earnestly Loved Him with inward heart. Emma. You grow religious, The ties of earth unloose. Make no farewell, Do not come near me living; but this favour I ask of you, when you return from Rome, Visit my grave. You will have learnt how lowly The courtesy to death. Canute. O Emma, Emma, My greatest, dearest, it was in your heart To put away my rival. Emma. You can pray, It is the chief use of your lips. I'll die! [Stooping over Guinevere's grave.] I would be buried with my kind; your place Will be by flawless Arthur. Canute. Do you jeer? Then I will fling you off from bed and board. Emma. Clip my long hair, and dress me as a nun? I prithee give me into custody O' the archbishop. To the barrÃ¨d cell! For he is gentle; he will bring my boy To play bo-peep at kissing. Canute. You will make him A murderer, a traitor. Emma. Like his father! Canute. Since penitents are dumb beneath the scourge, I do not chide you. [Aside.] There is strength in me To judge her, and condemn. A fatal creature! Can you repent? Emma. Of noble Edmund's death? Most bitterlyâfor England has no king, [Canute turns away.] And he had royal gifts. Oh, I am mad Thus from the grass to hiss at him. He goes; Then all is disannulled between our lives,â I am a lonely corpse. Help, help! Come back! Canute. What would the queen with an unkingly man, Whose crown she shares? Emma. A lie, a hateful lie. The wet mould at my breast is chill, and bitter The memories that come up through the turf Of that lost woman. Canute. Emma, do you find Your mate in her? Emma. Yea, since she sinned for love. There is no wickedness I would not work, No crimes so monstrous that it would not seem Part of my wifely duty, no deception I would not practise for your dear advance. I pray you mark, my king, that I confess My guilt. [Aside.] I am not feigning, so my nature Yearns for his deeper love.âMy noble Dane, [Re-enter Ethelnoth fearfully.] Your glory I have dimmed; as I deserve, Put me away from you. Ethelnoth [distractedly]. This must not be, What God has joinedâ Canute. Sever you not, you fool, With priestly intervention. She is mine! [Raising and clasping Emma. Exit Ethelnoth.] Mine, mine,âthe dearer for her wickedness, The more to be desired! Be not afraid, I have learnt this, sin is a mighty bond 'Twixt God and man. Love that hath ne'er forgiven Is virgin and untender; spousal passion Becomes acquainted with life's vilest things, Transmutes them, and exalts. Oh, wonderful, This touch of pardon,âall the shame cast out; The heart a-ripple with the gaiety, The leaping consciousness that Heaven knows all, And yet esteems us royal. Think of itâ The joy, the hope! Emma. The joy! To see your face Turned to my brow, that's joy; and if your soul Could even thus incline to my poor spirit, All would be firm between us. I am old, And fixed in disposition, hard to move, Not changed in one rare day. Oh, you are young; Have patience, give me slowly of your hopes, Your happiness. I thought I had no king,â All royalty was gone. But you are great Beyond our nuptial night, beyond the day That saw us crowned together. Canute. Starry tears, Such as the northern seas dashed in the face Of your young Viking. Emma. O Canute, these words Give me a home again upon your breast. Not wholly changed! Canute. For thou art mine. Thus linked, We will serve England; law and peacefulness Shall, of our effort, dwell within her shores. My brother could no more. Emma. This altar-cloth Hid in my robeâI had it in my thought To lay it secretly on Edmund's shrine. Will you present it? Canute. O my Elfgifu, Say that you wrought it carefully with tears. Emma. No; God forbid the foul hypocrisy! These blue and shining peacocks that I sewed Were for pure love, and every lady-stitch Entwisted for your sake. Canute. A frank confession. [Aside.] The glorious, golden heart!âThen we together Will lay it on our kingly brother's tomb. Emma, the holy places I have wrecked Make ruin in my dreams. Emma. With all my relics You shall give reparation: we will found Great houses. [Aside.] Now his eyes are shed on me Full as the morning sun.âAnd for our England We will take common thought. Canute. Her sons shall serve One God and worship Him, one Christendom For ever hold, and with right truthfulness, Even as thou, shall love Canute their lord. And I have vowed, in that I basely slew Their hero-king, that all my altered years Shall be a great atonement, and accomplish The best of his conception. We are led By baffling roads to wisdom, but a light Creeps ever after as we step along; I turned back in my sin, and then I saw The dogging lustre. Let us take our gift, Your work, my queen, to Edmund's sepulchre. This is to be a pilgrim:âthe new life Is full of blessing. Come! [Exeunt into the Church.]</field>
