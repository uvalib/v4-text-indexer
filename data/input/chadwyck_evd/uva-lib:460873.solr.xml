      <field name="fulltext">THE POISON FLOWER (Suggested by Hawthorne's Rappaccini's Daughter)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE PLAY Giacomo Rappaccini, a Doctor of Medicine in the University of Padua. Giovanni Guasconti, a Student of the Humanities. Celio Ruffini, a Student of Medicine. Beatrice, Rappaccini's daughter. Lisabetta, an old servant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The scene is laid in Padua in the latter half of the Fifteenth Century.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene I Guasconti's Chamber in the Palazzo Mattei. The scene represents an apartment with walls panelled in cedar to three-quarters of their height. Above the panelling is a frieze of stamped leather. The coved ceiling is painted with arabesques. In the R. corner at back of stage the R. wall forms a re-entrant angle: on the wall facing footlights of the angle so formed hangs a mirror; in the other wall of the angle is a secret door leading to a spiral staircase which descends to Rappaccini's garden. At back a window with leaded glass looks into the garden. On the back wall in the corner L. hangs a crucifix. A door L. near footlights leads to an ante-chamber. Beyond the door a table stands against L. wall, and above it a shelf with books. An arm-chair stands in front of the table, another chair between the table and the door, and a third chair against R. wall near the mirror. A curtain is drawn across the window. Enter by the door L., Lisabetta ushering in Guasconti. He places his cloak, sword and hat upon the chair by the door, and looks round. Guas. Heigho! Lisa. GesÃ¹, Maria! What a sigh from a young breast! Are these apartments not to the gentleman's mind? Guas. Somewhat gloomy perhaps. Lisa. Ah! he gentleman is from the south, I see. Guas. From Naples. Lisa. His honour must love learning to come all that way to Padua to study. But the good God sends us His sunshine here as well as in the south. There! [She draws back the curtain. The sunshine streams in. Guas. Ay, that is more cheerful. Whose arms are these? Lisa. Why, whose but the Count Mattei's. Guas. This, then, was his own house? Lisa. O surely, surely! These are his excellency's own apartments, the only part of the palazzo he keeps now. But he comes seldom to town, and quits us soon. Guas. Absit omen! [Looking out of the window.] But what a quaint old garden! Is this the count's? Lisa. Ay, surely, the count's it is. But it is the queer pot-herbs grow there now. [In a low voice.] 'Tis given over to Signor Rappaccini, the famous doctor; and there he works early and late, and they tell strange stories of his doings among the baleful plants he grows in it. Guas. Rappaccini? I have heard his name. He must be curious in poisons. A terrible garden indeed. Lisa. Poisons or cures, God knows. But they do sayâ [crossing herself]âthat God Almighty never made half the wicked-looking things that grow in that garden. Guas. It might well be. Lisa. Is there anything further his honour commands? Guas. A flask of good wine, dame. I expect a friend. Lisa. That you shall have, signor, and welcome. Exit Lisabetta. Guasconti, leaving the window, draws the arm-chair away from the table and seats himself. Guas. In Padua, at last in Padua! So far upon the high road of my hopes, Yet nowâ[sighs]âThe musk of cobwebbed ancientry Breathes from the dusky panel of these walls. This chamber haunts my sense with silent speech, Words that veil mysteries, like the blanching tale A ghost would tell, but may not. [He rises and takes down a book from the shelf. All I see Is new, and yet familiar; and I act As on a stage, the memory of a dream. [He gazes at the crucifix. Each moment whispers: âThis thou hast lived before.â [He turns towards the corner where the mirror hangs. A mirror should hang here: and here it hangs! How pale and strange my face looks! I'll not gaze, Lest shuddering expectation make me mad. [Beatrice's voice is heard singing in the garden. Beatrice 's Song Heap me a mound of holy spice, With camphor, sandal, cinnamon, Gums and rich balms, like that whereon The magian phÅnix burns and dies! There let pale women hush their cries To do in desolate array Soft rites, and chant low litanies, Till thunders roll around the skirts of day: Then fling the torch and come away, Come away, and leave the kindled pyre Where love lies dead, that was the world's desire. [Guasconti listens intently, then runs to the window, opens the casement, looks out, and draws back disappointed. Guas. I knew I should see nothing. But that voice! Earth has her siren; all my senses sing, And the lone caverns of my inward ear Sound on, like musing shells that lull themselves To sad content with ocean's lingering boom. O rich remembrancer of worlds unknown For which I am long homesick, sing once more! [He draws the arm-chair to the window and sits. Beatrice's Song [farther off] The aloe feels the year of years, Wakes, and the wandering bees it callsâ [He looks out again, the song ends abruptly. Guas. I knew I should see nothing, save the glow Of noon o'er that dread garden, where I see Each venomous thing sprouts rankly as the weeds Upon forgotten graves. In the deep hush No cricket's tune is heard, only the stir Of some quick-darting lizard. Sleeping snakes Bask on hot stones, coiled furies, in the sun, Enough to furnish cold Medusa's hair; And snake-like plants, nameless in mortal tongue, Pant from their gorgeous flowers, drinking the blaze. Subtle intoxication. I grow faint With the sweet horror. O that song! that song Voluptuous Lilith sang o'er Adam's sleep And flushed his blood with sensuous sorcery! [A knock heard. Come in. Re-enter Lisabetta with wine and flowers which she sets on the table. Lisa. The wine, signor. Guas. Thanks, dame. Lisa. And I have made bold to bring your honour some homely flowers from wholesome gardens, to brighten up the chamber. Guas. [Rising and coming forward.] A thousand thanks, good mother. Lisa. [Placing the flowers in a vase.] Lilies of the Madonnaâthere is no poison in them I warrant you. [Beatrice sings.] Love is reborn, that is the world's desire. Guas. What rare creature sings in the garden? Lisa. [Crossing herself.] Sings, signor? Holy Virgin, and you have heard Rappaccini's daughter sing? Guas. She or some siren. Lisa. That bodes no good, for they say her song can drive men mad. Guas. Well, well, be that as it may. When my friend comes, show him up. Thanks for the flowers. Lisa. Now St. Anthony of Padua be your guard, young man! Guas. Amen, good dame. [Exit Lisabetta. If 'twere my fate to see her? [He returns to the window. Lords of life, 'Tis she! How all the garden's potencies Burn clear in her, the goddess of the garden! She treads the earth like purple Ashtaroth, The splendid flower of earth's dread motherhood, Yet virginal as lilies of the chamber Where Mary knelt, and heard the angels' âHail!â Oh, she draws near! her subtle effluence fills The air with rapture! Nay, I dare not look, Lest I should meet her eyes. [He draws back from the window. Yet I will dareâ I mustâthese flowers shall be my messengers. [He takes a spray of lilies from the vase and looks out. She doth enrich the sunshine, for its flame, Transfigured in her blood, glows on her cheek, And in her beauty wins superbest life. Voice of Bea. Hail, hail, my sister splendour! Guas. Oh, she speaks! What mystic rite she does I know not, gliding With sinuous course, a flower among the flowers Which as she bends mingle their breath with hers. Horror grows beauty, poison hath no bale, But finds a wholesome use now she is by. What doth she now? [He leans out of the window, then draws back What rank two-natured thing Is that huge plant wherewith she stands commingled, Branches and arms? Voice of Bea. Embrace me, sister mine! Give me thy deadly kisses, which are life To the unmated passion of my heart. [Guasconti looks out again. Guas. She kisses those dark flowers, whose lurid hues Glow like the wedded colours of her gown, Purple and orange. Now the rites are done. She goes. Now must I dare it. She looks up, Her lips half parted in a wondering smile. Hail, mystery of the garden, lady, hail! Voice of Bea. Hail to thee, stranger youth! What is thy name? Guas. Giovanni dei Guasconti. And thine, thine! Voice of Bea. Beatrice Rappaccini. Guas. Beatrice! [Aside.] O more to me than Dante's Beatrice! [He lets the flowers fall from the window. Take these pure lilies and remember me, If I should never see thy face again. Voice of Bea. Thanks for thy flowers, Giovanni dei Guasconti, And yet they shoot a pang into my heart. Guas. Thou wilt not go? Voice of Bea. The powers I serve constrain. But we must speak once more. Farewell! farewell! Guas. Farewell! So swiftly gone? She laid my flowers Upon her breast, and straightway she grew pale. And they, I saw, or else my sight was dazed, They withered at her touchâSome wine, some wine! [He sits at the table, pours out wine and drinks. A knock. Then re-enter Lisabetta, ushering in Ruffini. Lisa. Signor Ruffini! [Exit Lisabetta. Guas. Ah, Celio! [He rises and grasps his hand. Ruff. Thou look'st strangely. Guas. Nay, be welcome. Ruff. And welcome thou to Padua! Guas. [Bringing forward a chair.] Sit and pledge me. [They sit and drink to each other. Ruff. To the grave Muse of the Humanities, And thy fair nuptial with her! Lord, I have climbed Higher than Helicon to reach thy eyrie, And I arrive still panting. [He looks around. But, sweet saints! How com'st thou here, Giovanni? These are surelyâ Guas. The Count Mattei's chambers. Ruff. Knowest thou, then. This Count Mattei? Guas. He was my father's friend. [Ruffini rises and looks out of the window. Ruff. Oh, thou art fooledâbetrayed! 'Tis as I thought, This window looks on Rappaccini's garden. Guas. Well, what of that? Ruff. I tell thee there's no chink In all the town that on the accursed place Yields an eye's peeping, save this window here. Its fellows, see, along the garden front, Are all made blind with solid masonry. [He comes back into the room and begins tapping the walls with his dagger hilt. In the corner where the mirror hangs he pauses. Ay, here's the secret stair, this panel slidesâ Soâfacilis descensus! 'Tis locked now, Butâ Guas. How! A secret passage to the garden? [He drinks nervously. Ruff. Ha! thou may'st well turn pale! This Count Mattei Is that grey sorcerer's famulus, his gull. All his estates and fortune are sequestered For Rappaccini's use. Guas. And he, what is he? Ruff. A sorcerer, man, a sorcerer, in whose hands This garden's hoarded poisons are the tools Wherewith he works. They say he has a daughterâ Why leaps the blood into thy kindling cheek? Thou hast not seen her? Guas. Well, suppose I had? Ruff. Then art thou lost, soul, body, all that makes A man a man. Better thou mad'st thy mistress The vilestâ Voice of Rappa. Beatrice! Beatrice! [They start up and look out. Ruff. His voice! Oh, look you there! Mark that black spider Which in the garden spreads his web for thee. Guas. What wears he on his face? Ruff. A glass mask. See How delicately poisoners handle poison. He fears the thing he gloats on, gloves his hands, A guard upon his face. They say he feeds His hell-brood with men's flesh, pours infants' blood For waters on those beds of deathâ Guas. Mere slander: I see no blood. Sweet heaven, she comes again! Ruff. Back from the window! O thou flower of sin! Guas. She seeks the fountain. Ruff. I did ne'er believe it; But there the monstrous mandrake grows indeed. What is that image with the awful face Which 'midst the thronging branches sits enthroned? Guas. 'Tis pale Persephone, the triple queen, Potent in earth, and heaven and deepest hell. Ruff. Ha! saw'st thou that? Guas. What? I saw nothing. Ruff. Nothing? How when she plucked the glowing purple flowerâ Guas. I thought the shuddering plant gave a deep groan. Ruff. And from the severed stalk fell gouts of blood. One on that lizard on the fountain's rim Dropped, and the beast writhed, and anon lay dead. Guas. I saw but the swift pity in her face. Ruff. Ha! there again. Those butterflies! Guas. They drop Out of the airâ Ruff. Slain by her venomed breath. Guas. It cannot be. Ruff. O thou weak, amorous fool! That vampire Succuba is poison-proof, Because she feeds on poisons. Back, man, back! The swart enchanter shot a furtive look From his snake's eyes at thee. Guas. I felt it not. Now they pass out of sight. Let us sit down. [He retires from the window. They sit and drink. For God's sake, Celio, tell me what strange tales Are current of this garden? Rappaccini? What secrets has he read behind the veil That covers Nature's face? Ruff. That the Devil knows. Well, heaven be praised, I am not of his sect, But orthodox, of old Baglioni's school. Guas. Is there, then, controversy 'twixt the pair? Ruff. Good Lord! the world rings with it. They have ransacked Old classic dunghills for opprobrious terms To daub each other with. Guas. What is the issue? Ruff. A hundred several issuesâthis in chief: This Rappaccini with rank heresy Would postulate a dual sex in God. Guas. A dual sex? Ruff. His lewd philosophy Turns all on sex; and, further, he proclaims The female elder in its origin, And nobler in its essenceâheresies! But we have swinged him in three several tracts, And have the latest word. Guas. But for his practice? Ruff. They sayâ [He drinks. Guas. What do they say? Ruff. He would search out In life's red core the mystery of evil, By cursed means. Guas. What means? Ruff. He would explore The principle of life, track generation Through earth's protean forms, watch it in operance, Where like the Ancient Snake it eats the dust And works through cosmic change. Guas. A glorious aim. He has dared nobly. Ruff. Has dared damnably For a fantastic dream. A vaulted cell, Deep underground, he makes his laboratory; And there, they say, with purposed cruelty He tortures living things, and with the dead Works impious enchantments. Marry, his philtres, Elixirs, balsams, salves have wrought, they say, Strange cures. Guas. Some dim remembrance comes to me: Did he not stay the plague in Padua? Ruff. Ay, so the vulgar deem. This and his interest With some lewd potentates whose debauchÃ¨d blood He has renewed with his foul wizard's broth, Have kept him from the sorcerer's rightful doom. Guas. But tell me, Celio, of that magic plant Which o'er the fountain casts its evil shade. Ruff. I never yet gave credence to the story Till now. 'Tis his new Eden's tree of life, Sprung from the old root of knowledge. In his tractate, De Sexu, he discourses in vague jargon Of such a plant, which he names Ashtaroth. Guas. Ashtaroth? Yes, that name! what notes he by it? Ruff. [Laughing.] Why, womanhood, whose essence, earth's rich blood, Is symbolled in its colours. Guas. It moves my soul Like wizard's words, with an ecstatic dread Ruff. Bah! 'tis mere folly. Guas. But this poison-flower, Whence hath it sprung? From what mysterious seed? Ruff. The fairest woman in fair Italy Fled from her friends for love of this grey ghoul, To share his secret-lore; young, highly born, A widow left well-dowered, and thronged about With suitors, gave her beauty to this wretch, Was Rappaccini's mistress. Guas. She was thenâ Ruff. Thy Beatrice's mother. But still worse. I ne'er believed the tale till now. She died: Or as some say, with a new babe unborn Was coffined quick there by the marble fountain, In yon great marble tomb. See where it stands, That monstrous plant, fruit of its cursÃ¨d womb. Guas. O horrible! yet the horror fascinates. Ruff. Thou shalt not stay to nurse thy soul's sick dream. Come, thou shalt share my chamber for to-night. Guas. No, no, begoneâleave me aloneâmy fate Is in that garden. Ruff. Come with me, Giovanni! Guas. Nay, Celio, do not vex me: for by Bacchus A foot I will not budge! Here is my home. Ruff. By Bacchus and his vats, thou art an ass! Come, I can show thee women in this town To whom thy siren is a rustic jade. I'll steep thy sense in pleasures that shall make This garden fade with dreams forgotten. Guas. Pleasures? Ruff. Sin wholesome sins that are youth's natural spice, And leave mere outward smutches, which but show Upon the man some varnish of this world. Guas. I hold in loathing every vulgar pleasure. Ruff. Good Lord! when virtue leads men to the devil, It grows a fiend; and now thou hast a devil Which I would fain cast out. Dice, drink, be wanton In human fashion, revel it like a man; But deal not in unnatural sorceries, Lose not thy soul, Giovanni. Guas. Oh, that soul Is lost indeed, which dares not shape itself In action by the laws of its own being! Life holds eternity, there is no other. Ruff. Madman, abjure thy rash impiety! Come with me. [Seizing Guasconti by the arm, he endeavours to lead him away. Guas. Never! [He frees himself, snatches his sword from the chair and draws it. Hence, upon thy life! Ruff. There is no parleying with thee in this mood; But I will save thee yet. Farewell, my hero, Heaven keep thee in thy wits. [Exit Ruffini L. Guas. Amen! Amen! We are both mad. So madmen carp at madmen, As poison wars with poison. I could weep now Over the wretchedness of mortal life, Where pleasure grovels in a filthy sty. But here's my world. How shall I enter? How? [He taps with his dagger upon the secret door. Beat out my life upon this iron door Like a caged bird. [Knocking heard.] Come in! Re-enter Lisabetta with a letter Lisa. A letter for Signor Guasconti. Guas. Thanks, leave me. [Exit Lisabetta. What subtle perfume steals into my sense From this white packet? Wax, yield up thy secret. [He opens the packet and reads. âSignor Giovanni dei Guasconti,âIf thy soul be pure and thy heart bold to explore the thy mysteries of my realm, the way is open to thee; the key is in thy hand. Wear this talisman upon thy breast.â Beatrice.â A heart-shaped talisman; upon the obverse, Graved in a scroll, the legend: Medicatrix NaturÃ¦ Vis. Upon the reverseâwhat? Beatrice's name. And here the key, the key! Drop Scene Falls</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene II Rappaccini's Garden. Afternoon. Across the front of the stage runs an arcade of marble arches on light pillars, in the style of Fra Giocondo, the spandrels decorated with medallions, forming a corridor, the floor of which has a tessellated pavement. Through the arches is seen the garden, a broad walk R. running to the back of the stage, between flower-beds; a row of termini on one side. Half-way up the stage a second walk, with high hedge of box, crosses it at right angles. At the back of the stage a marble staircase leads to a grove of ilex-trees on a higher level. A palace front is seen behind them. A fountain L. with a marble sarcophagus, out of which grows the great poison-plant. Behind this a statue of Persephone amid cypresses. A doorway R. leads to Rappaccini's house. A bench just within the arcade faces the footlights. A brazen incense-burner, in which incense is burning, is placed on the ground near the fountain. The curtain rises to solemn music, showing the stage darkened by an approaching thunderstorm, with flashes of sheet lightning. Rappaccini is seen coming slowly down the main walk, Music. Rappa. Elohim! Elohim! Ye elemental powers Who walk in darkness, yet are purest light, Inspire me now! I go to my great proof. [He approaches the fountain, and stands with folded arms, gazing at the sarcophagus. Distant thunder heard. The hour should now be almost come. Maria! Canst thou speak yet? Voice of the Dead Woman. I hear thee. All is well. Rappa. O most victorious martyr, holiest saint, Now is our triumph near! Speak, will the Magi Come to the mystic nuptial, when the blood Weds with the fire? [Thunder. Voice. They will surely come. Rappa. Who shall renew the world? Voice. The Reconciler. Rappa. Darest thou yet speak his name? Voice. Incarnate Love. Rappa. Tarries he still? Voice. He treads the opposing ways. Rappa. When shall they meet in one? [A loud peal of thunder. Voice. Darkness o'erwhelms me, And silence dumbs my tongue. Farewell! Farewell! [The music ceases. The storm passes slowly away. Rappa. Enough that thou hast spoken. Beatrice! [Beatrice appears from the house R. Bea. My father! Rappa. Now creation's mystery Waits its apocalypse. My Beatrice, Daughter of the world's destiny, conceived From the beginning for the world's release; Mother of its crowning race, new Eve, earth's queen, Fed from the flowers of this mysterious garden, With the sweet honey which has made men mad, But now shall make them gods, be wise to-day. Bea. What must I do, dear father? Rappa. What thou wilt. Be free to obey the voice of thine own heart; And the great Magi, who are lords of life, Endow thy soul with wisdom. [He lays his hands on her head. Bea. Thou art moved, My father, past all wont. Is there some danger To me or to thy great designs through me? Rappa. Yes, there is danger. Canst thou keep the path? Bea. With exultation, wheresoe'er it lead. Point me the way. Rappa. The hour brings its own light. Walk in that light. For death, or the new birth, This youth comes to the trial; and this hour The choosers of the bridegroom choose thro' thee. Bea. I lean upon their arms and have no fear. Rappa. 'Tis bravely spoken. Come, take up the brazier, Feed it, and where thou knowest, set it still burning. [Beatrice takes up the brazier, and exit into the house R. My lamp of life is flickering to decay. Yet I shall reach the goal. I must, I must! [Exit, following Beatrice. A pause. Music, during which the sun shines brightly out. Enter into the corridor, L., Guasconti. He passes into the garden and walks about examining the flowers. Guas. On wings of wild desire I entered here, A few tumultuous pulse-beats past; and now A deadly numbness masters heart and soul. The unholy power hymned in Sidonian groves, Works in the curious breeding of these forms Unnatural intermixture. Tigerish things, Alluring flowers breathing voluptuous dreams Of sumptuous Babylonian harlotries, Bask in these closes, where the gendering sun Glows like the thirsty fires of hell. No wind Of wholesome passion stirs my lethargy. Is this the garden's curse? [He sits upon the bench. Enter Beatrice from the house. She stands gazing at him, then speaks. Bea. I am here, Giovanni. Guas. Save me! I sink in an enchanted sleep. Bea. 'Tis the dull apathy of death in life. The talisman! Sirocco never breathed On man such deadly languor as these flowers. [He kisses the talisman, rises slowly, turns and looks at her. Guas. And never where the rosy feet of morn Print first the chestnut glades of Apennine, Fell healing dews more soft than from thine eyes. Bea. Oh, I am glad, and bless the gentle powers That gave them healing, thee to feel it so. Come, let us talk. I have a thousand questions To ask of thy strange world. Guas. But first of thine? Bea. If thou wouldst learn this garden's hidden lore, Turn to the ancient wisdom of my father. Guas. Nay, let me be thy pupil, only thine. Art thou not skilled in deep philosophy, Able to teach with thy mellifluous breath Truths more recondite than enriched the tongue Of virgin-sages in their later Greece? Bea. [Smiling.] Nay, I am no fair sage. Guas. Art thou not then Mistress of magic learning? Bea. O believe not The tales they tell in the misdeeming world Of me and of my arts. Judge me alone By what thine eyes attest. Guas. Prescribe my creed; Bid me believe thy lips and not mine eyes, And I'll believe them. Bea. [Agitated.] What lurks in thy thought? Guas. I sawâor thought I sawâ Bea. [Sternly.] Give it no tongue, If it be evil count thine eyes but liars. The things we see are symbols void of sense Until the soul interprets. Read me then By the quick-throbbing flame within thy soul. Guas. I'll read thee by the splendour of thine eyes, Which are deep wells of light, fed from the springs Of thy divinest spirit. Bea. Well, let us talk Of the great world that lies beyond this garden. Guas. Is it to thee a world unknown? Bea. I know it But in dim pictures of the magic glass, Wherein I have seen sad things, conned tragic tales In act before mine eyes. Guas. What hast thou seen? Bea. The world, I find, is but a poison-garden Far worse than ours; for here my father's art From venomous roots distils balsamic dews Which have the power of healing. There it seems The sweetest joys are seed of deadliest bale. Guas. Sad wisdom, learnt too early! Bea. Is it wisdom? I never talked before with anyone Out of that world. My father, like a stranger, Visits the ways of men, feared and not loved. Stern and strange even to me, who love, not fear, him. Guas. Oh, what a lonely life thou hast led here! Bea. Yes, very lonely, now I feel how lonely. Guas. Would that my poor desert might crave a glimpse Of the rare treasures of thy maiden thought, Locked in the unopened casket of thy mind! Bea. View them but as the treasures of a child. I'll tell thee first how first upon my spirit Fell the great shadow of the wings of death, There to abide. It was an April morning, And I, a tiny child, had run alone Into the bosco which o'erglooms the garden, Where, in the shade of the dark ilex-trees, Pale cyclamens, like tender flames of spring, Pierced through the rotting leaves. Guas. I did not dream That in these precincts grew such harmless flowers. Bea. [Sighing.] They grew there once, but now they grow no more. Guas. A theme of sorrow. Well? Bea. Night's hoary dews Lay thick on the young grass and fallen leaves, Drenching my feet, which stirred at every step Fresh vernal scents; and all the bliss of spring Ached in my dancing blood. Guas. Sweet Beatrice! Thy words are odours breathed from childhood's fields, In the rich balm of thy perfumÃ¨d breath. Bea. [Aside.] Oh, he can drink the poison of my breath And take no hurt! [Aloud.] I filled my baby hands With cyclamens, and down yon marble stair Danced in pure ecstasy, down into the sunshine, And past me as I came dashed a sweet pair Of Love's brown birds, the wooer and the wooed, Winged with the joy of life into this garden. Guas. And thenâ Bea. They wooed no more. I saw them flash Into the bower of such a parasite As thou see'st there, that gaudy vampire thing Whose clinging sucks its victim's life away. Thenâ Guas. What befell? Bea. They dropped like arrows spent And on the walk lay dead. And a great awe Fell on me, though I thought they did but sleep; For I knew sleep, while death I did not know. Guas. Poor child! Bea. My treasured bunch of cyclamens From my hot hand fell withering on the walk, And their two tiny bodies, warm as life Still, with their passionate blood, I tenderly Took up, and soothed their helpless wings, and laid Softly each drooping head, and sped within To show them to my nurse. Guas. And she? Bea. She told me The tale we all must hear and wonder at. Guas. That we are as the birds? Bea. I questioned her If death were in the world as in our garden. She told me how I was her fosterling, And her own son, the babe she had forsook To nourish me, had died. And I know now I was his parasite. Guas. Nay, think not of it With self-accusing. Bea. 'Tis the commonplace Of nature, we are all but parasites, We live upon each other, and the strong Eat up the weak. Guas. Too long thou hast dwelt alone, Companioned by dark spectres of the mind. Bea. I have seen life within the magic glass, The prey of madness, and disease and death. Guas. What fascination drew thee thus to pore Upon the wounds of life? Bea. It is the hope By which I live that I was born to bring Some ease to the sick world; for all the sorrows That haunt the house of tears ache in me still, Like the seven swords piercing Our Lady's breast Guas. Even such a moment's passion I have known, But like a coward shrank from the great cross Whereon the world is crucified. I thought Joy is man's rightful heritage, and I The prince of that lost kingdomâgive me joy! Bea. How may we win the world that heritage? Guas. Oh, I know now, love is the only joy In earth or heaven. Thou, Beatrice, thou Art my lost kingdom's queen, and winning thee I win my heritage. Crown me, Madonna! Here, as thy knight, I kneel and kiss thy hand. [He kneels and tries to take her hand. She recoils. Bea. Nay, touch me not. Alas! what shall I say? There lies invisible betwixt us two A gulf as deep as death. Guas. Oh, let me cross it Borne on Love's wings. Bea. It may not beânot yet. As well the torrid and the frozen zone May meet in one, as thou and I. Not yetâ Perhapsâ Guas. I'll dare more than Leander did For Hero. Bea. That was pastime for a boy To the strange peril thou must face for me. Guas. For thee, for thee! this challenge of my love, So sweetly, gravely given, wakes a wild hope That thou wouldst fain be won. O Beatrice, I grow too bold! Pardon the audacious dream Thou hast inspired. Bea. Our voices rang so clear Across the gulf, misted with morning dreams, I had almost forgotten that my love Were scathing fire to thee. Yet hope, and dare. Guas. I am a moth whose passion for a star Pants in the sightless frenzy of its wings For mere annihilation. Bea. O my beloved! Would I might giveâ [She suddenly presses her hand to her heart. Guas. What sudden pan pang assails thee? Bea. The garden claims me. O my sister flower, When till this day ever did I forget thee? And now I had forgot. [She approaches the fountain; Guasconti rushes forward. Guas. The flower, the magic flower! Grant me but one, One splendid bloom, my lilies are o'erpaid. [He attempts to pluck a flower. Bea. Back, for thy life! [She seizes his hand, he recoils with a cry. Guas. Ah my hand burns! Bea. No more? I have not slain thee! Oh, thou art pure in heart. Guas. The searching fire shoots through me, vein by vein. 'Tis agony and yet I do not die. Bea. It is the cleansing alchemy of love. The sun within thee burns in his own fires, And I, the o'erwintered earth, await his beams. Guas. I will endure and wait the destined hour. Bea. I have waited long to hear the bridegroom's voice; Now there come whisperings, as of vernal winds, In budding trees. My father bade me live As one predestined to a glorious task, The healing in the world of love's deep wound. Guas. We must go forth, the bridegroom and the bride, To win earth's kingdoms. Bea. Canst thou read my thoughts? Yet, yetâwe must part now. Dear love, farewell If thou canst trust me still, meet me to-morrow. Come when the sinking sun leaves the young moon Pale on his glowing throne. Guas. My faith in thee Stands firm as Atlas; not a single star Shall fall from our love's heaven. Drive quickly, moon, Bring with thy dragon steeds our meeting hour. [As he passes into the corridor, Rappaccini appears at the door R. Beatrice slowly follows Guasconti, kissing her hand to him. Bea. Farewell! Guas. Farewell! [Exit Guasconti, L. Rappaccini, advancing, looks after him. Rappa. The powers have made their choice: he does not die. They shall go forth to purge the festering world, Saving and slaying, death to evil things, And healing to the chosen ones of God. Drop Scene Falls</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene III Rappaccini's Garden. Sunset. Enter into the corridor Guasconti, a bunch of lilies in his hand. Guas. I voyage still between two worlds of dream, Myself a dream! In Padua streets to-day Men were as ghosts to me; and they, I felt, Looked on me with scared eyes, as on a ghost. It is almost the hour. Enter Ruffini Ruff. Giovanni! Guas. Ha! Celio! how com'st thou here? Ruff. Why, like thyself, By the secret stair. Guas. Hence, on thy peril! Ruff. No; I come to save thee, and by heaven I will, Spite of that hoary devil, Rappaccini, And his witch-daughter. Guas. Thou blasphem'st a saint Ruff. A saint? O madman in an opium dream Besotted by the drug that poisons thee! Guas. Never so rich in health as I am now. Ruff. So say they all. It is the gravest mark Of thy disease. Hast ever heard the tale Of the fair woman whom an Indian prince Sent as a gift to conquering Alexander? Guas. Spare me the tale, for it concerns me not. Ruff. Nay, listen! listen! She was fair as dawn, She was arrayed like sunset; and her breath Sweeter than spiced Arabian winds. Guas. Her breath? Ruff. Intoxicating perfume, richer, mark me, Than Persian roses breathe in Gulistan. Guas. Intoxicating perfume? Ruff. Rarest jars By Orient craft wrought from earth's finest clay, To hold the absolute essence of the rose, Shame not the pottery of a peasant's wheel As she the journey-work of Nature's hand. Guas. Thou art no Hafiz, Celio, and her charms Grow fulsome on thy tongue. A loftier strain; Oh, she would tempt an amorous conqueror To lose the world for her, and think itâpshaw! Come to the moral butâbut this rare creature Wasâwhat? Ruff. As dangerous as the poisoned rose Sent by a Borgia to some honoured friend Guas. Yet Alexander died not. Ruff. Alexander Had a most sage physician in his train, And took his timely warning, shunned the witch As Death's twin sister; else she had dumbed indeed Earth's thunders round the car of Macedon, Sooner than wine and fever. Guas. By what sign Did this physician mark her down a witch? Ruff. Even by her breath. Guas. Her breath? Ruff. She had been fed On poisons from her birth, until to her Poison was elemental in her blood, Her kisses death. She was a poison flower. Guas. This is mere fable. Ruff. Fable? So thought I, Until I sawâ [Rappaccini crosses the garden. Look there! Guas. 'Tis Rappaccini. Ruff. This garden is a purlieu of that cell I told thee of; here, as on some poor dog, Some captive thing that whines and licks the hand That dooms him death, he practises on thee Some damned experiment. Guas. On me? [Exit Rappaccini L. Ruff. Ay, thee. Thou didst not note, but I did, how his gaze Was bent on thee as thou didst walk to-day Across the market-place, with such a look As he might fix upon a mouse whose blood Held poison from his limbecs. Guas. Idle dreams! Ruff. His eyes were scalpels, cutting to the soul, And on his thin lips gleamed a passing smile Of inward triumph. Guas. 'Tis thy fantasy. Ruff. My conquering Alexander, trust me, no. This garden is thy India, and in me Hear thy physician. O my dear Giovanni, I am here at deadly peril to myself For love of thee! This Rappaccini's daughter Is such a poison-flower, as beautiful And deadly as that witch of classic tale. Guas. [Turning angrily.] 'Tis false! I am not poisoned by her breath. Ruff. [Recoiling.] Far worse. Changed by its hellish alchemy, That subtle perfume which so drugs the air, I faint in a voluptuous lethargyâ It is not from the garden. 'Tis thy breath, Thy poisonous breath. Guas. [Horrified.] My poisonous breath? O God! It is not true. Ruff. Here, put it to the proof. See this foul spider, sitting in her maze; Breathe on her. [Guasconti breathes on the spider. See, she fiercely agitates The web and grows invisible. Again! [He breathes again. She drops suddenly dead. Art thou still doubtful? Guas. [Laughing hysterically.] Ha! ha! Can I kill thus? I'll rage like death On all mankind. Ruff. [Avoiding him.] Oh, this is terrible! [Guasconti looks at the flowers in his hand. Guas. These flowers? Dead! dead!âall blasted by my touch! [He flings them away into the garden. There, let her take this bridal gift from me. Ruff. Listen, Giovanni; does this Beatrice Return thy love? Guas. I did believe so. Fool! Yet, yetâOh, innocence dwells in her face, Like the sweet sky in crystal water, Celio! Ruff. Well, grant her innocent; but her vile father Plots for thy ruin. He would hold thee here An alien from the world, to be her mate. Guas. Is this the gulf, O God, is this the gulf That I would overpass? Ruff. But if she love thee Thou mayst redeem her to the wholesome world. Guas. How? how? Ruff. Baglioni sends thee by my hand This antidote, so potent it can quell All Rappaccini's poisons, like the snakes Swallowed by Aaron's rod. [Beatrice appears in the garden. Bea. Giovanni! Ruff. Hark! Guas. It is her voice; the garden's ancient spell, Which fascinates and kills, rich in its flute. Ruff. [Gives the phial.] This delicate piece of goldsmith's artistry Is but the precious rind which holds immured A juice more precious. Take it, drink with her, Or, if she drink not, slay her with thy sword. Bea. Giovanni! Come, the hour is overpast, My love, I wait for thee. Guas. I'll go to her With eyes unsealed, thanks, Celio, eyes unsealed, And prove her love by this, thy talisman. Ruff. Go, in God's name. I dare no longer bide. [Exit Ruffini. Guasconti enters the garden. Bea. Giovanni! Oh, 'tis thou? Late, late, my love! How I have waited for this holy hour. Guas. Well, it has come. [They pace in silence, side by side. Bea. [Shivering.] How cold the sunset falls! Guas. Yes; it is cold. Bea. My heart is full of love, And yet I have no words. Guas. [Bitterly.] What, not a word, Though for thy sake I have outswum Leander And passed the gulf? Bea. The gulf? Guas. [With fierce irony.] Ay, my sweet bride, Let us make merry. Deck with flowers the charnel, Set forth our wedding banquet, let us quaff Healths to each other out of brimming skulls, Deep healths in wolfsbane and mandragora. [He inhales the odour of the flowers. For see with what a craving appetite I pasture on thy poisons. Bea. Dear Giovanni, Jest not so wildly. Guas. [Approaches the poison flower.] Now, my queen of flowers, The secret of the garden. I demand My last initiation. What strange sin Gave this bright horror birth? Bea. No sin, but love. A human spirit, sister to my own, Lives in its life. It is my father's child Sprung from my mother's tomb. Guas. [With horror.] That tale is true! O womb of earth! I have seen battlefields Where men long sown revisited the sun As melancholy weeds: but in this garden There's magical husbandry. Thy father's child? Bea. Reverence in her creation's mystery, Which he hath fathomed as no man before. Guas. The sweat of awe is cold upon my body, Yet all my blood cries out in wild desire For but one flower. Bea. I know not if I dare. [Rappaccini steps out from behind the fountain. Rappa. Yes, Beatrice, hear the bridegroom's voice; Give him the flower, for he may wear it now. [Beatrice plucks a flower and places it in his breast. He stands entranced. The hour is come, the blood weds with the fire! [He extends his arms over them, as in blessing, then exit into the house. Guas. [Recovering.] Ashtaroth! Ashtaroth! Bea. What means that cry? Guas. What part had I in these unhallowed rites? Her blood is in my veins, leavens my blood With poisonous fire. I am accurst, accurst! Bea. Giovanni! Speak to me, one word to me! Guas. Dost thou not see me hang on the world's cross, Cast out, accurst, alone? Bea. Nay, I am with thee. Guas. Mock, then: I am the scapegoat of the world, Yet work no man's redemption through my pangs, Like the poor thief, who went the devil's way, Who gave him pity? Bea. Would I might understand. I knew there dwelt a doom within the flower: But deemed that loveâ Guas. [Laughing.] Thou canst not understand! There yawns the gulf again, as deep as hell. Bea. There is no gulf love cannot overpass. Kiss me, Giovanni. We are made one through love. Guas. Kiss thee! O thou she-Judas! Can thy kiss Sunder me more from the fair world of men, Than all this poisonous change thy arts have wrought? Bea. Giovanni! [She recoils and seems about to weep. Guas. Wilt thou weep? Have sirens tears? Can those who trade in shipwreck pity the drowned? Bea. O Virgin Mother, look on me, thy child; All thy seven deadly swords are in my heart! Guas. Ha! canst thou pray? Thou witch whose very prayers Infect the winds with poison! Ay, let us pray, Let us to church and dip our tainted hands In holy water, set our deadly lips To sacred chalices, our orisons Like muttered spells infect the blessed bread, That heavenly offices work fiery death! Bea. O God! O God! Guas. Well said! Blaspheme his name, Sign crosses in the air, let our foul plague Light in redemption's symbol on men's heads, Smite Padua like a curse, heap every street With festering corpses! Bea. Oh, what have I done That thou appall'st me with such words of hate? Guas. What hast thou done? Made me even as thou art, A thing more deadly than the basilisk. Bea. But not to theeâI am not this to thee! And yet some sudden horror frights thy love Into abhorrence. Thou hast stabbed my heart More cruelly than with swords. Oh, leave me now, To die with my dead hopesâgo thou thy way. Guas. I leave thee! I! Art thou so innocent? Behold! These gnats that spring and sink again, A cloud of rhythmic life over the fountain, Be as a city of men within whose walls. We two walk like the pestilence. Behold! [He breathes upon the gnats. Bea. Slain by thy breath! Oh, doomsday shoots a glare Of light into my soul! My father's art! Guas. Ay, his black magic that hath made us two The things we are; outcast beyond the ban Of lepers' cells. Bea. I knew not what I did. Ah me! I was so lonely in this garden! Guas. So thou didst lure me here, as flies by flowers Are caught with poisonous honey. Well, thou art Alone no longer. Bea. Never so alone! My poor Giovanni, I begin to fear Thy heart holds deadlier poison than this garden Ever brought forth. Guas. My heart? Bea. The black mistrust That is love's bane. Woe's me! With what pure faith I trusted in thy faith. I dreamed thy love Would clasp me all the closer, though the flames Of hell should roar and rage against that faith. Guas. Am I a god to bear such things and blench not? Bea. I knew men were not gods, yet saw the god In just the one man out of all the world, Thee, thee, mine own! Now thou hast killed my heart, Kill then this wretched body. Give thy hate Full wing to swoop in any fierce revenge It craves to assuage it. Only let my blood Break this foul spell. It can, and set thee free. Go back into the world, dwell with thy kind, And keep no soil of my forgotten love. Guas. [Kneeling.] If in this fiery trial of my faith I have reproached thee for thy father's sin, Forgive me, Beatrice, for my love Assoils thee of that sin. Bea. Too late, too late! Alas! forgiveness is a bitter sweet. Bruise but a butterfly's soft feathery wings, It pines an alien in the sunny air; Never glad flight again. So pines my soul. Yet it is sweet, Giovanni, from thy love, Not from thy hate, I may demand my death. Guas. Death, death! Thy words are mad. Could I transcend The faltering virtue of our mortal nature? I love thee still. Bea. As men love captive things. I must be free. Guas. O yet there is a way To life, love, happiness. I had nigh forgot This phial. Here I hold a precious juice, Sent me by old Baglioni, which can make Thy father's poisons tame. Bea. Doubt my own father? That's little now. [Smiling.] Baglioni's antidote? I dreamed, fond I, love was the antidote For the most virulent poison of the world. Must I drink this, Giovanni? Guas. For my sake, In earnest of thy love. Oh, we will drink Together, thou and I, and go forth healed Into the world! Bea. To love, then, and thy health! [Music to the end of the scene. Beatrice drinks and hands Guasconti the phial. Guas. And this to thee, to thee! [He drinks. Bea. Ave atque vale! Guas. No funeral words. Await our happy change. Bea. It comes, Giovanni. Here, here, in thine arms, One moment close to thee, let me dream out The foolish happy dream. Yes, thou and I Have stretched our longing arms across the gulf, And touched, touched once. Ah! could love do no more? I fear I have wronged a noble heart in thine. No time to weep all well! [She frees herself and stands a moment her hand pressed to her heart. Guas. What ails thee? Bea. Death. So poison casts out poison. [She reels suddenly and falls. Guas. What have I done? Bea. Made thy face but a memory: for mine eyes See only night, and lose thee evermore. Thy hand, reach me thy hand. Guas. [Kneeling beside her and taking her hand.] My love! My love! Bea. Oh, I am swept away from thee, away Into the vast. Guas. Fool! Fool! Mock me, ye fiends. Beatrice! Bea. O farewell! We two may meetâ Perchanceâlong ages henceâ [She dies. Guas. Wilt thou escape me? Through life's dark postern slip into the void?
