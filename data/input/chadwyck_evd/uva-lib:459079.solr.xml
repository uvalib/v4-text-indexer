      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Tis worth my Feares, to see within this place Wits most accomplish'd Senate; tis a grace Transcending our desert, tho not our feare, Least what our Author writes should not appeare Fit for this Iudging presence; all the wayes He knowes that lead to the true throne of Playes Are rough uneasie pathes, such as to tread Would fright an active able Muse; strike dead A weake and timerous travailer: for some Will giue the play a pitious Martyrdome Ere it hath life; yet have t'excite that flame, Only distrust in the new Authors name. Others for shortnesse force the Author run, And end his Play before his Plot be done. Some in an humorous squemishnesse will say, They only come to heare, not see the Play, Others to see it only, there have beene, And are good store, that come but to be seene: Not see nor heare the Play: How shall we then Please the so various appetites of men. It starts our Authors confidence, who by me Tels you thus much t'excuse the Comedy. You shall not here be feasted with the sight Of anticke showes; but Actions, such as might And have beene reall, and in such a phrase, As men should speake in; Ladies if you praise, At least allow his language and his plot, Your owne just Priviledge, his Muse hath got So full a wreath, that spight of Envies frowne Shall in his Brow sit as a lasting Crowne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. Scena. 1. Enter Bonivet, Lactantio, and Vitelli. Bonivet. Is the newes certayne he is arriv'd? Vit. The Duke Had sure intelligence, that the whole Fleet Anchor'd last night without the Bay: and now For confirmation of it, the thick breath Of his saluting Cannon hangs in Clouds Over the Cittadell, and the glad noyse Of the applauding people, gratulate His entrance to the River. Bon. The day rose So cheerefully, as if it meant to gild With unaccustom'd light, his sayles swolne big As pregnant mother with the pleasing ayre Of victory. Lac. The rumour of the Fleet Has fild all Jtaly with wonder, how So small a number should in open fight Defeat the Turkish Navy; and conclude The Generals skill and valour, the mayne cause Of the atchievement. Vit. Hee has return'd as large Assurance of his worth, as when his force Back'd with successive fortune which attends His mighty resolution, over-threw The power of Uenice in a fight; which changed The Sea into a flame, and tooke me in't His fortunate Captive. Bon. Sir, tis noble in you To acknowledge that as good, which might have bin Your eminent ruine; stately buildings so Rise out of ancient structures which the rage Of eating time, or anger of the windes Had totter'd from the ground works: you may prove As fairely happy in the Generals love, As in the honour which your name or Country Confer'd on your desert. Vit. You speake the scope Of my intention, a perfect friend Includes both honour, Country, Family, And all that's deare and holy: such a friend As is my Doria, to whose spacious merit Succession shall pay volumes, who was man Ere in the smooth field of his face, rough age Displayd his hairy Ensigne; who has puld Bright honours wreath from her triumphant front In battailes when the trembling Sea being calme Did croud and thrust its waves into a storme To part the dreadfull fury. Lac. The report Of his Land services do stand on termes Of Competition with the multitude Of his Sea Victories. Vit. Yet must subscribe To his Navall triumphs: though the Land Has seene him Conquerour, when the bodies slayne Buried the ground they dy'd on, which did shake To view it selfe entomb'd by them, for whom It was ordain'd a Sepulchre, the Drums Were to his eares delightfull as the Lute: Pikes moving then in Forrest, seem'd as groves Of lofty Cedars stird by sportive winds, And when warres Quiresters, the whistling Fife, And surly Trumpet sung an army dirge, That fatall musicke wraps his sprightfull sence, Like joviall Hymnes at Nuptialls. Bon. You cannot exceed His praises duty, since his worth containes Ent. Frangipan. Honours most severall attributes. Lac. Signior Frangipan, What riding post on foot, whither in such haste? Fran. Very well met gentlemen, I scarce have breath To utter a wise word yet. Lac. We doe believe you Signior, and are in doubt When you'll have leasure for't. Fran. Heare you the newes, The General's arriv'd: farewell, he will not land Till I have had the maiden-head of his hand. Exit. Bon. Tis such another Parrat, he relates Things by tradition, as dogs barke: his newes Still marches in the reare, yet he relates it As confidently, as if each tale he tells, Ent. Doria, Adorni, &amp; Sabelli. As to be straight inserted as an eight To the seven former wondersâBut here comes one Will cut off the Fooles Character: renowned Generall Doe us the gratious honour to permit us Salute the hand has sav'd our Country. Do. Noblest friends, I am more victorious in your earely loves, Than in the Turkish Conquest; though I remaine A Captive to your kindnesse, my Vitelli, The solid earth, or a continued Rocke, May by some strange eruptions of the wind, Be rent, and so divided; but true friends Are adjuncts most inseparable: I have Still worne thee here Vitelli, as a Jewell Fit for no other Cabinet: gentlemen Your welcome hands me thinks we should embrace, So as ships grapple in hot fight, nor part, Till our affectionate fury has discharg'd Vollies of joyfull courtesie. Ador. This is fitter ceremony for them Then to embrace an enemy, who will not part On termes so easie; these gentlemen know better To cut a Caper, than a Cable, or board a Pinck in the Burdells, than a Pinace at sea: I marvaile my Lord should know such Milk-sops. Vit. My Lord, You come t'instruct us Courtship, as y'ave taught Your foes to feare your valour: you appeare As if this were your Nuptiall day, on which You were to wed bright triumph; but you can As well Court peace in silkes, as raging warre In burnish'd steele, and touch the ravishing strings With as much cunning industry, as if Mars could like Orpheus strike the trembling Harp. Signior Adorni welcome home, I hope Y'ave made a richer prize, then when my ship Struck to your mercy. Ador. Yes, we are very like To make good prize indeed, when all the profit Goes to the State and heavy-headed Burgers, That lye and snort at home, and eate what we Sweat bloody drops for. Do. Honest Adorni, His bluntnesse must excuse him gentlemen; How harsh and rough soe're he seemes, his honour Will quickly vary, when I have bin tyr'd With toyle of warre; the observations which His travailes have afforded him of men, Countries, and manners, lively set forth Flourish. Enter Trivulci, Chrisea, Eurione, Corimba. By his expressive action, has begot Mirth in my drowsie soule: when y'are acquainted With his conceit of carriage; you'll not affect A jovialler Companion,âSee the Duke Tri. My noble warriour, Peace now lookes lovely on us, since we enjoy The author of't in safety: rise my Doria, Let me embrace those youthfull limbes which cloath Warre in loves livery: thy honour'd father, When he return'd laden with Turkish spoyles, As trophies of his valour from the slaughter Of Haly Bassa at Lepanto, where The Christian name was hazzarded, arriv'd not More welcome to the State; beleeve me youth, Hadst thou a mother living, to be proud Of thy Nativity, unlesse she wept For joy to see thee, could no way expresse A more affectionate gladnesse: Chrisea, Eurione welcome him home, who cannot Receive an equall grace to the just value Of his deservings. Chri. Your grace prepares us for that, We did intend to offer. Corin. Yes truely did wee sir, this Generall is ill-bred, I warrant him, to slight a gentlewoman of my demeanor. Dor. My gracious Lord, To tender thanks, where tis a debt, not duty, Befits an equall; subjects ought to offer, With the sincere devotion that our Priests Doe prayers to Heaven, their hearts as sacrifices To their deserving Princes, whose sole favours Doe as the quickning lustre of the Sunne Cherish inferiour spirits: yours have bin Showr'd downe on me as elementall dew On the parcht earth, which drinks it up, and cannot Give heaven a retribution, yet my duty Shall speak my willing thankfulnesse, and while These armes can weild victorious steele, no danger Shal fright me from that service which I owe My Prince and Country; since men are not borne For themselves onely; but their life's a debt To th'Common-wealth that bred 'hem. Tri. Gentle warriour, Thy fathers spirit swells thy soule, I reade it In thy submissive loyalty; lets in, Tis just that those who caus'd the warres to cease, Flour. Ex. prÃ¦ter Corim. and Eurione. Should have the early fruits of their owne peace, Euri. Corimba. Have you imploy'd a serious diligence yet In giving Lord Vitelli secret notice Of my affection to him? Corim. Truely Madam, And as I hope to have a husband yet Ere I be fifty, I have beene so ta'ne up About my new device, I scarce have leisure To say my prayers sincerely: Ladybird You looke not sprightly, ravishing, onely this star Was not well cut, nor well laid on, it wanted A little of my learned art: Vitelli Doubt him not Madam, he shall love you so: Tis pretty neat now; I would not have a Lady That weares a glasse about her have the least Pimple in her countenance discompos'd, it does Disgallant a whole beauty. Eur. But Corimba What's this to me, thou maist as well tell tales Of love to one departing life, these toyes Relish with me as bitter pills with children, Wilt thou effect my businesse? Cor. I confesse I have beene very fortunate in bringing Couples together, though I neare could couple My selfe with any, your Ladyship could not Have chose a better agent. Enter Frangipan. Fran. Save you sweet Lady, save you, Aunt I have Lost all my mornings exercise at Tennis In seeking you, and yet was still in hazzard, Whether I should meet you; I must request a little Helpe from your Art good Aunt, a patch, or two, To make me appeare more lovely; for my glasse Tells me I have a very scurvy face Without some ornament. Cori. Tis a good innocent face, be not asham'd on't; Ile cut out one instantly; nay I never Goe unprovided of materialls let me see, What forme is best for thee; that somthing timerous A heart stuck neatly on thy face, will excite Thy heart to more audacity, good Madam Dost not become him prettily? Cosen be sure You doe commend this fashion to all gentlemen, Wert but as common among them as Ladyes, My wit would be eternally made famous For the invention. Fran. Wilt please you to dispatch Ant, i'me in hast, I've a whole staple of newes to vent. Corin. Of what troe? I would have my kindred more ridiculous To th'world than I am; Cosen all your newes Is stale; invent me rather some choice story, How true or false no matter, and declare it For newes, twill please farre better, and endeare Your judgement i'th' relationâ Enter Doria, Chrisea, Sabelli. Fran. Noble Generall y'are happily encountred: Have you seen my Aunt yet Signior, here she is I have Newes to informe you worth your knowledge. Dor. Keep them Good Signior till some other time; Eurione We must implore your absence, we'd be private. Cor. Why we have beene trusted With as good secrets: please your Lordship Accept this Crescent, you see my Cosen Is in the fashion; let me lay it on, Insooth your face is, for a souldiers, Too smooth, and polite; this device will shew As't had askar upon it, which is an honour To faces Military. Dor. Good Madam gravity, Keep your devices for your Chamber Lords, That dance to Ladies shadowes; pray be gone, We need not your societyâSabelli. Exeunt. Put to the doore, and then be goneâChrisea Exit. The modest Turtles which In view of other more lascivious Birds Exchange their innocent loves in timerous sighes, Do when alone most prittily convert Their chirps to billing; and with feather'd armes Encompasse mutually their gawdy neckes. Chri. You would inferre that we Should in their imitation spend this time Intended for a conference which concernes us Neerer then Complement. Dor. Why my Chrisea, We may entwine as freely, since our loves Are not at age yet to conceive a sinne, Thine being new borne, and mine too young to speake A lawlesse passion, for my services Pay me with pricelesse treasure of a kisse, While from the balmy fountaynes of thy lips Distils a moisture precious as the Dew, The amorous bounty of the morne Casts on the Roses cheeke: what wary distance Do you observe? speake, and enrich my eares With accents more harmonious then the Larks When she sings Hymns to Harvest. Chri. Sure my Lord Y'ave studied Complement; I thought the warre Had taught men resolution, and not language. Dor. Oh you instruct me justly, I should rather Have tane the modest Priviledge of your lip, And then endeavor'd to repay the grace With my extreamest eloquence. Chri. You mistake me. Dor. Remit my ignorance, and let me read The mystery of thy language in thy lookes, In which are lively Characters of love Writ in the polish'd tablets of thy cheekes: Which seeme to vary colours, like the Clouds When they presage a storme; and those bright eyes Dart unaccustom'd beames, which shine as anger Flash'd from their fiery motion. Chri. You misconster The intention of my lookes, I am not angry Though much distemper'd. Dor. At what, by whom? Lives there a creature so extreamly bed Dares dis-compose your patience? speake, reveale The monster to me; were he fenc'd with flames, Or lock'd in Bulwarkes of congested yee: And all the feinds stood Centinels to guard The passage, I would force it to his heart, Through which the mounting violence of my rage Should peirce like lightning. Chri. I beleeve That in some triviall quarrell to redeeme My fame, should scandall touch it, you would fight Perhaps to shew your valour: But I have A taske to enjoyne me, which my feares possesse me, You dare not venture to accept. Dor. By truth You wrong my faith and courage to suspect me Of so extreame a Cowardize: have I stood the heat Of Battailes till upon the mountainous piles Of slaughter'd Carcasses, the soules which left em Seem'd to ascend to Heaven: that your suspition Should taint my honour with this base revolt? This is not noble in you. Chri. Do not rage, When you shall heare it, you will then confesse Your confident errour. Dor. My loyalty will not Permit that strong rebellion in my breast, To doubt the meanest falsehood in a word Her voyce can utter, which should charme the world To a beliefe, some Cherubim has left Its roome in heaven, to carroll to the earth Celestiall Anthems, and I now beginne To question my owne frailty; but by all Which we call good or holy, be't your will I should invade inevitable death, In its most ugly horrour, my obedience Shall like a carelesse Pilot cast this bark On that pale rocke of ruine. Chri. Will you sweare this? Dor. Yes, invent A forme of oath so binding, that no Law Or power can dispense with: and ile seal't With my best blood: pray Madam tell me what The imposition is you judge so easily, Will stagger my just truth, that I may flye On Loves light wings to act it. Chr. Heare it then, and doe not, As you respect your oath, or love, request The cause of what I shall command. Dor. Still Suspitions: My honour be my witnesse, which no action Shall violate, I will not. Chri. Enough, that vow Cannot but be materiall, receive it, I must no longer love you. Dor. That's no command: what did you say Chrisea? Chr. I must no longer love you, and command you, Leave your affection to me. Dor. Y'are very pleasant Lady. Chri. You'll finde me very serious: nay more, I love another, and I doe enjoyne you, Since tis a man you may o're-rule, to assist me In my obtaining him, without whose love I'me resolute to perish. Dor. Sure I dreame, Or some strange suddaine death has chang'd his frame To immortality; for were I flesh And should heare this, certaine my violent rage Would pull me to some desperate act beyond The reach of fury; these are words would infect Rose-colour'd patience; Cleere and lovely front With loathsome leprosie, change flames to teares And with unusuall harshnesse of the sound Deafen the genius of the world. Chri. Where's now The strength of soule you boasted, does the noyse Of the death speaking Cannon, not affright Your setled resolution, and the voyce Of a weak woman shake your youthfull blood Into an ague: since you so ill beare this When you shall heare the man, whose love has stolne Your interest, you will rage more than unlimited fire In populous Cities. Dor. Sure tis she who speakes: I doe enjoy yet sound untainted sence, Each faculty does with a peacefull harmony retaine Its proper Organ; yet she did rehearse She must no longer love me: oh that word transformes The soule of quiet into rage, Above distracted madnes: madam tell me, What place is this? for you have led me Into a subtle Labyrinth, where I never Shall have fruition of my former freedome, But like an humble anchorite, that digs With his owne nayles his grave, must live confin'd To the sad maze for ever. Chri. Sir you cannot By most submissive and continued prayers Reclaime my affection, which stands fixt as Fate Vpon your friend Vitelli. Dor. My friend Vitelli? Chri. Sir, I not use To jest my life away: Vitelli is The person, to obtaine whose pretious love I doe conjure you by all tyes of honour To imploy your utmost diligence. Dor. Can I bee So tame o'th' suddaine? has the feeble spirit Of some degenerate Coward frighted hence My resolution, which has given a Law To fate it selfe, that I must now become The stale to my owne ruine: oh Chrisea, Who wert so good that vertue would have sigh'd At the unwelcome spectacle: had you Appeard but woman in a passion, Though of the slightest consequence: oh doe not Abjure that Saint-like temper, it will be A change hereafter, burdenous to your soule: A sinne to one, who all his life-time blest With peace of conscience, at his dying minute Falls into mortall enmity with heaven, And perishes eternally. Chr. My will guides my determination, and you must In honour act your promise. Dor. Yes, I will, Since you can urge it tho, but two Things pretious to me, and one cruell word Robs me of both; my friend and her, Chrisea I have not left another sigh to move, Nor teare to beg your pitty. Chri. They are but vaine, You may as easily thinke to kisse the starres, 'Cause they shine on you, as recall my vowes, Which I will urge no further; but wish you Regard your honour: But farewell, I must Be cruell e're, to my owne love unjust. Ex. Dor. She's gone; what vapour, which the flattering Sunne Attracts to heaven, as to create a starre, And throw it a fading meteor to the earth, Has falne like me: I am not yet growne ripe For perfect sorrow, but as a bubling brooke, That sports and curles within its flowry Bankes, Till the vast sea devoure it, onely falling Into the abysse of mischiefe; passions surround My intellectuall powers, only my heart, Like to a rocky Island does advance Above the fo my violence of the flood, Its unmov'd head: love be my carefull guide, Who sailes 'gainst danger both of wind and tide.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Bonivet, Lactantio, and Adorni. Bon. Thanks good Adorni, we are much endeer'd To your relation; this rich corsick wine Erected our dull spirits, and you shall Command our service in as high and jocund A Nature. Ador. Sir, although I am One that affects not the nice phrase of Court, Having bin nurs'd in warre, yet I can frame My selfe to imitation of what honour Shall there, or any where appeare to be Worthy my laughter. Bon. You have explain'd your knowledge, we who breath Onely the aire of Genoa, and ne're tasted Forraigne behaviour, covet nothing more Than certaine knowledge of it, as 'tis proper to Complexions intellectuall to delight In novelties; your Spaniard as you say, Is of a staid, serious, and haughty garbe: Acts all his words with shrugs and gestures, kisses His hand away in kindnesse; is of dyet Sparing, will pick his teeth as formally After an Orenge, or a clove of Garlicke, which is his ordinary morsell, as he'd fed On Partridges or Pheasant. Ador. 'Tis his grace After his dinner Sir, and to confirme Their most officious gravity, a Castilian Was for some crime in Paris to be whipt In triumph through the streetes, and being admonished To be more swift of foote, so avoyd The dreadfull lash the sooner, in scorne answer'd, He rather would be flead alive, than breake A Title of his gravity. La. Much good Doe it his patient shoulders: but Adorni, What thinke you of the French? Ador. Very ayry people, who participate More fire than earth; yet generally good, And nobly disposition'd, something inclining Ent. Corim To over-weening fancyâThis Lady Tells my remembrance of a Comick scene, I once saw in their Theatre. Bon. Adde it to Your former courtesies, and expresse it. Ador. Your entreaty Is a command, if this grave Lady please, To act the Lady I must court. Cor. Why doe you thinke I cannot play the woman? I have plaid a womans part About twenty, twenty yeares agoe in a Court Masque, And tho I say't as well as some o' them, &amp; have bin courted too, But it is truth, I have a foolish quality as many more women are guilty of besides my selfe, I alwayes love them best, which slight me most, and scorne those that doe court mee: look you Signior, if't be a lovers part you are to act: Take a black spot or two, I can furnish you. 'Twill make your face more amorous, and appeare More gracious in your Mistris eyes. Ador. Stand faire Lady. Cor. Tis your part to stand faire sir: doubt not my carriageâ O most rare man: sincerely, I shall love the French The better while I live for this. Ador Acts furiously. Nay pray sir; gentlemen entreat the man To pacifie his wrath, tell him Ile love him, Rather than see him rage thus. Bon. He would have just reason to be mad indeed then, but now The Mood is alter'd. Ador. acts ut antea. Cor. Excellently ravishing: this is of force To make the hardest hearted Lady love him: Can I intreat him but to teach my Cosen Some of his French, he will for ever be engallantedâ Enter Eurione, and Frangipan. Bon. Beautious Cosen, Y'ave mist the quaintest sport; honest Adorni You would endeare this Lady to you, would you Please to react it. Ador. Nay, if you make me common once, farewell; I am not for your company. Cor. Pray sir a word or two; here is a gentleman, Nay Nephew, though I say't a toward young man, Vouchsafe him your acquaintance. Ador. Will he fight, is he souldier? Cor. No truely sir, nor shall hee bee: I would be loath to have my onely Cosen Heated about the heart with lead; he's dull Enough already: Frangipan come hither, This gentleman will for my sake teach thee French. Ador. For your sake reverent Madam I shall do't: Sir please you walke, we will conferre on rudiments. Cor. Come with him Coz: Sir, and you have occasion To use me in a pleasure, stands within The ability of my performance, pray command, You shall not be deny'd. Ador. Come Signiors, will you walke? Ex. Eur. Cosen Bonivet, I should be glad, after some minutes, to Enjoy your Company. Bon. I shall attend your Ladyship, Eur. Corimba what answer from Vitelli? do I live? Or in the killing rigour of his scorne Must I dye wretched. Cor. Sincerely Madam, You are too timorous of your owne deserts, Or else you durst not doubt, that he, or any You being so neat your selfe, and drest as neatly As any Lady in the Court, should hazzard The reputation of his wit, by slighting Such an accomplish'd beauty. Eur. You talke, And play the cunning flatterer, to excuse Your negligence; but know affections fire Once kindled by desire, and blowne by thought Into a heat, expires a thousand sighes, Which as loves smoak, like incense flyes to heaven, While the light fire with nimble wings doe foare To its owne spheare, true lovers hearts who cherish The flame, till they to ashes burne, and perish. Cor. Why Ladybird, are you so passionate, the gentleman Is a kind gentleman, has all that may Set forth a man; for when I told him how Like a hurt Deare you wounded were with love, Life how he leapt for joy, as if the selfe Same arrow which struck you, had glanc'd on him, And as a token of his love, hee sent you A bleeding heart in a Cornelion, which Beshrew me, most unfortunately I lost. Enter Chrisea. Chri. Cornuba see If Generall Doria be withinâEurione Ex. Cor. I have beene seeking thee, how dost thou sister? I must demand a question that concernes The safety of your fame. Eur. I rest Secure in mine owne innocence, and no malice Can forge an accusation which can blemish My meanest thought with scandall. Chri. I beleeve, but know Eurione I am enform'd You doe affect Vitelli, and conjure you By the deare memory of our mother, tell me If the report be certaine. Eur. Should I deny't, My love would muster thousand blushes up To invade my guilty Cheeks, I must confesse I love him so, as modesty and truth Afford me warrant. Chri. Tis ill done, and childishly so easily to impart The treasure of your liberty, to keeping Of a neglected stranger. Eur. His owne worth Deserves as noble knowledge here, as many Who borrow titular glory from the dust Of their forgotten Ancestours. Chri. You defend him Like a brave Championesse, as if you meant T'ingage your dearest pawne of life and honour In his protection. Eur. Say I did, the even'st, Though most strict justice would allow as lawfull My honourable purpose. Chri. Fie, you are lead on too wildly by your fancy sister, It ill befits the greatnesse of your blood To seeke to mixe its pure streame with a poore Regardlesse River. Eur. He appeares to me Broad in his owne dimensions as the sea. Cleare as a brooke, whose Christall lips salute Onely the freshest medowes: such a Creature That were some cunning painter to expresse An Angell cloath'd in humane shape, he might From his derive a patterne. Chri. But suppose my fancy Should over-sway my judgement, to affect Vitelli; sure your manners would allow me, By willing resignation of your choyce, The priviledge of my birth-right. Eur. Would you urge A claime so justly mine, because you view'd The light two yeares before me: no Chrisea. Love's an unlimited passion, that admits No Ceremonious difference: this prerogative Should Queenes endevour, their unvalued Dowries Are not of worth to purchase: and tho here As it befits me, I observe the distance Due to your birth; yet in loves sacred Court, My place is high as yours, and there we may Walke hand in hand together. Chri. Doe not flatter Your fancy with this vaine conceite: Vitelli Must be no more yours; Know I have enjoyn'd The Generall Doria to engage his friend, To imbrace my proffer'd love to him. Eur. You strive, Because you thinke my young and timerous flame Unapt t'incounter brave Vitellis heat; As cunning Nurses doe with froward Babes, Fright them into an appetite: but say All this were reall, thinke you Doria would So easily be perswaded to renownce His proper interest, and inthrall his friend To an unwilling slavery? Chri. By truth he has impawn'd his honour to endeavor What I have utter'd, gentle Girle consider Loves unresisted violence, and beleeve I would not have a rivall to usurpe A corner in the Kingdome of that heart Of which i'me soveraigne, so farewell deere soule, Consider ont. Exit. Eur. Consider ont, why this is such an act, Done by a cruell sister, as shall taint That holy name with such a blacke reproach That should a thousand pious Virgins weepe, Rivers of teares, their most immaculate drops Would not wash white her scandall haplesse girle, That in loves tempests wert but lately tost; And now recoverd in a calme art lost,â Enter Lactantis Lact. Madam the Duke intreats your instant company. Eur. I shall attend his pleasure, good Lactantio. If you can meet my Cosen Bonivet, Desire him visite me. Exit. Enter Doria. Dor. Noble Lactantio, Y'are happily encounterd, I expected My friend Vitelli here, this is his houre, I wonder he is tardie. Lact. Your Lordship prevents the time with speed, or else Vitelli Has some impediment by businesse, sir. Enter Uitelli. Y'are opportunely welcome to deliver Your owne excuse, I was about to stretch My invention for you. Uit. Noble friend, your enemy had you ingagd your faith To any personall meeting could expect you, But at the minute, reason may dispense Twixt us with such a nicety. Lact. Now your friends Arriv'd, I must beg licence to depart, I have some vrgent businesse. Dor. Good Lactantio your time's your owne. Lact. I kisse your Lordships hand. Exit. Vit. Friend now wee're alone, I safely may Speake my conjecture, I have read your lookes, And in their pensive Characters finde secret, Strange signes of sadnesse. Dor. I am sad indeed, When my remembrance tells me I have only Verball assurance of your friendship. Vit. Try me by any attempt, whose danger does surpasse The common path of daring, beet to snatch, A firy boult when it from heaven comes wrap'd In sheetes of lightning to afford true proofe Of my affection, and with eager haste, Such as inspires a husband to enjoy His spouses virgine purity, ile runne To the atchievement. Dor. These are but protests; such as be got by ceremony, proceed Not from intensive zeale, yet ile experience The truth of your affection by a triall Of such a noble and effective weight, Which if you bravely doe support, you'l stand As some tall Pyramid or Columne for Your owne memoriall to tell after-times The power and strength of friendship. Uit. Pray nam't, and 'twere a burden would orepresse the earth, Ile be the able Atlas to sustaine Heaven on my willing shoulders. Dor. There is a Lady in whose each eye sits fire, &amp; on her cheek Victorious beauty captive to her smiles Dances in lovely triumph, one who emblemes The glory of mortality in each looke, Contracts the orbe of lusture to a glance, Brandishes beames, whose purity dispence, Light more immaculate then the gorgeous east, Weares when the prostrate Indian does adore Its rising brightnesse, yet this wonder doates On you with such inevitable fervor That I in pitty of her sufferings come T'intreate you love her. Vit. Whom my Lord? Dor. You cannot appeare so strangely stupid not to acknowledge Creations miracle, when I point out Her very figure you as well may seeme, When the bleake North does with congealing blasts Binde up the crisling streames in chaines of Ise, Not to know Winter, ignorant of her Who had she liv'd when superstitious mists Shaded the world, more groves of gammes had fam'd, T'her Divinest beauty, then to all The race of idle deities: tis Chrisea, The faire Chrisea loves you. Uit. The faire Chrisea, your Lordship's merry. Dor. Doe you slight What I deliver'd with that unfain'd zeale, That penitents doe their prayers, I say, Chrisea, A name whose every accent sweetlier sounds, Then quires of Syrens sence bereaving notes, Chrisea loves you infinitely above Expressive termes; the Orators shoud strive To paint her masculine fancy, and i'me bound To pay this homage to her best content, As to conjure you, by all sacred ties Of honour, amity, and what else may serve To inforce the indeerement with your noblest love To gratifie her fancy. Vit. No perswasion Can make me thinke this serious, good my Lord, Doe not you love Chrisea? Dor. More then a babe does the kind Nurse that feedes it with her blood, More then I doe my quiet, or the joyes Of ought but blest eternity; Uitelli, No other argument can more convince, Suspition should it doubt my love: but this That to procure her peace, I have confinde The greatnesse of my passion, and give up To thy dispose, a Iewell which the earth And sea should both unlade their hidden wealth, Should not have purchas'd from me. Vit. These are arts to pusle my conceits, my Lord I'me no such punie in the Craft of love, That I want braine to finde this drift, which is As obvious to me as your eyes: now you Are home return'd victorious, big with praise, Laden with titles that sit heavier on you Then your steele Corslet in hot fight contemne, Affinity with me, to whom y'ave heard the faire Eurione has resign'd her heart, And by this circumvention should I court At your entreates her sister might pretend A righteous cause, for an unjust revolt, For were it otherwise, your temper could not Brooke your Chriseas change without a start Into a sudden fury. Dor. This language I understand not, by my honour friend, This iteration may disperse your doubt, I doe agen conjure you by all right Friendship can challenge in you to affect Chrisea nobly; shall I have your answer? Vit. Nay then my Lord, since you are serious, freely I resume The priviledge of my liberty; this body I doe confesse your captive, and t'has sufferd an honourable thraldome, but my minde Remaines unbounded as the ayre or sire, Are from their spheares, Eurione has wone By the subduing valor of her lookes, That in a field of fancy, not of blood, And ere another shall usurpe her right, In the defence ile dye her willing martyr. Dor. I judg'd what serious value your boasted friendship would retaine ith test, Draw your bright weapon, know that I doe hate Basenesse as much as cowardice: and since You slight a Lady for whose pricelesse love Kings might resigne their Crownes, and humbly fall Like bare foot pilgrimes prostrate at the shrine Of such a beauty, sure if in this sword, Death has a residence your life shall finde it, And not survive to boast the cruell triumph of her refusall. Vit. Sir your sword cannot excite a trembling in my blood, The glistring splendour cherishes my sight, Like polish'd Chrystall, henceforth name of friend Be no more known betwixt us then a dreame. Thus I expire it, I may now regaine My honour forfeited in the Generall cause By this particular Combate. Dor. Should my fate yield me the conquest, yet his death would not Beget Chriseas quiet, but augment Her griefe and hate against me: stay, forbeare, I feele a palsie in my veines, and cannot Manage this little instrument of death, My sinewes put on infancy agen And have no vigor in them, oh Vitelli, I am so full of passion, I have scarce Roome left to vent a sigh, a mine of lead Hangs on my heart, and with its weight has crack'd The feeble courage. Vit. Noble soule, his griefe Workes more compunction in me, than his sword Did suddaine anger; could I grant what you Request, no brand-markt slave should fulfill Sooner his Masters most severe command, Than I would yours; but this abrogates all lawes Of friendships duty: if y'ave vowd this act, You may as safely disanull the Oath, As should you in some desperate fury sweare To be your fathers murtherer. Dor. Bid me first renounce My allegeance to my honour, sell my faith I owe my Native Country: my Vitelli I feele an humour in my braine, which strives For passage at mine eyes, wilt see me weepe? Consider friend, denying my request Thou dost undoe a Lady, who may claime The priviledge of all hearts: depriv'st the world Of such a jemme, that should old nature strive To frame her second, it would quite exhaust Her glorious treasury, then in her ruine: My life and honour's forfeited, think this, And were thy heart obdurate as a rocke Of Adamant, this thought joyn'd with my teares Would sooner than the blood of Goats dissolve it To gentle softnesse. Vit. Your eyes are moving advocates, they speake Such an o're-flowing Language, that my love Then in its owne cause a most partiall Judge, Allowes my mercy freedome to pronounce Sentence on your side: you have prevail'd, Ile serve Chrisea, as her pleasure shall Dispose my will and fortune. Dor. I beginne to feele my spirits quicken, and my blood Receive its noble temper; deare Vitelli, Thy noblenesse does prompt thee to an act Shall write thy friendship higher in the lists Of sacred amity, than mothers loves. Goe to my best Chrisea, she expects To know by thee the truth of my successe, Tell her I am more happy in her blisse, Than if I had enjoy'd her constant love: So leave me love, I may perhaps transgresse Man-hood agen, and shouldst thou see me weepe Twice, thou wouldst judge my former flood of teares A feigned passion. Vit. Your Genius guard you; thus I apply Balme to his wounds, while I doe bleeding dye. Ex. Enter Bonivet. Bon. Noble Generall, I come to gratulate the happy choyse Y'ave made in faire Chrisea; she's a Lady, That though she were a stranger to my blood, My judgement would allow as rich a vertue As ever glorifi'd the sexe. Dor. 'Twould be a sacrilegious errour not to admit Your Character for truth, but in our loves A thousand hidden causes doe produce Alternate changes, my returne has setled My thoughts on new resolves, and I must suite My affections to them. Bon. How? perhaps because You are return'd triumphant with your bayes, Growing upon your brow, you doe reject The love before you su'd for, tis not noble So to abase a Lady, whose bright fame, Although untainted as a Christall rocke, Must passe a popular censure, if you, who Did with such earnestnesse pretend her match Should on the suddaine scorne it. Dor. I'me not bound To give you reasons why; but know my mind, Which your contesting cannot alter's fixt On what I have related. Bon. I must then tell you You doe defame the opinion of that worth The world does credit in you: this affront, Should all her other friends sit idle gazers On her disgrace, should stirre me to attempt An ample satisfaction from your heart, Though you had multitudes of greater glories Heap'd on your head, or were defenc'd with legions To affright me from the adventure. Dor. Sir, your courage is juster than your quarrell, doe you think I weare a sword onely for ornament; And though our yeares declare us equalls, yet My education was i'th' trade of warre. Tis my profession to infranchise soules From prisons of their flesh, and would be loath Cause you have interest in Chriseas blood, Your passion should betray you to the fury Of my incensed wrath. Bon. All discourse is tedious to me, sure the world's abus'd With report of your valour, men who commit Affronts they dare not answer, use excuse In moderation of them, I expected I should have met an adversary of you. Of temper hot as lightning, and as bold As Lyons vext with hunger, and I finde you A tame degenerate Coward: Dor. All respect of love and pitty hence: fight. Beare up, my steele Has prickt your breast; I would not have you dye Chriseas Martyr. Bon. I've puld untimely ruine on mee, I'me hurt, I feare to mortall danger: Noble Generall, See me conducted to Lactantios house, There I shall get a Surgeon. Dor. Noble young man, Muster thy strongest spirits up: I am one Of Fortunes pastimes; yesterday return'd, Advanc'd to heaven by the peoples breath, To day hurl'd downe into the abysse of death.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Enter Chrisea, and Corimba. Chri. Came none yet from the Generall? Cor. No insooth Madam; I protest your sister If she continue in these suddaine fits, Will so undoe her face, that all my art Can never rectifi't; shee weepes, as if She might as easily be supply'd with eyes As with new dressings, ile be sworne, I tooke As hearty paines to cut a handsome heart; And though I say't it was a pretty one As e're was made of Taffaty, to grace her Cheek, And never trust me if I lye to you, Her teares has wash'd her heart away. Chr. Th'art still In these impertinent discourses: what's the cause My sister is so prodigall of her griefe, To let thee see her vent it? Cor. Why Madam, I have seene a Lady weepe, Besides your sister, and have wept my selfe too, I never shall forget the time; I could Een cry agen to thinke on't; twas at the death Of your fine little Iewell: never Lady Nurst such a dainty puppy, but hee's gone, And farewell he; I will not give a rush For any woman cannot use her eyes With as much liberty as her tongue, these fooles, These loving Ideots men for three forc'd drops Will mollifie like wax, and be made apt For any impression. Enter Vitelli. Chr. Vitelli you are wellcome, I suppose Your businesse has been urgent, we expected Your presence sooner, howsoever now Tis grateful hither. Cor. My young Lady shall Have notice of's arrivall, perhaps his sight Will cheere her drooping spirits. Ex. Vit. Madam, my friend The Generall, does by me tender his best and truest service to you, he has sent me Prompt, to fulfill the nicest poynt of duty Your pleasure casts upon me. Chri. Sir, the Generall is so just in his proceeding, I must ever Esteeme him truely Noble, though I should Banish him my affection. Vit. I could wish The sweetnesse of your vertue would vouchsafe To lay a reclamation of your love: Had you but seene with what ambitious haste, With what extreame perswasions he endeavour'd The satisfaction of your will, you could not Fancy a change from one so worthy. Chri. No? not to enjoy your selfe? Vit. Me Madam; No equall eye can parallell my poore Regardlesse merit, with the glorious worth Which does as farre transcend mine in desert, As't does in eminence of fortune. Chri. Sir your modesty Extenuates your owne worthinesse, to bestow A large addition on your friends, my judgement Has ballanc'd both, and has concluded which Ought to be held most noble, I doe honour True constancy in men, pray tell me sir, For it concernes me neerely, did you ever Fervently love my sister? Vit. To include, (All strength of humane zeale) as Doria does adore Your excellent beauty, with a heat Holy as soules in deepest fancy Their sainted fellowes. Chri. And can you extinguish So great a flame so easily, can entreates, So soone subdue your temper? if your truth Be of this wavering quality, how shall I Receive assurance of it? Vit. The vow I made, my friend secures it, thinke not Madam That both my parents with perswasive prayers, Could have enforc'd me violate my faith To faire Eurione, but when my friend, My honor'd friend to whom I owe my life, As tenant to his, bounty did in teares, A souldiers teares whose every drop prevailes More then a captive princesse, plead the losse Of his owne life, my gratitude did vanquish Passion, and forc'd me tear even from my soule Euriones affection. Chri. You are just In your determination. Enter Eurione. Vit. Blesse me friendship, And with thy white wings overshade my heart, Or here descends a Saint will dispossesse thee Of the accustom'd shrine, a barke enclos'd, Twixt two encountring tides is not more tost Then I twixt striving passions, while a friend, I cannot be a lover. Eur. Uitelli am I in your opinion lost? my sister Relates so sad a wonder, that if truth, I am undone for ever. Vit. Harke she speakes too, A tempting language; such was our first mothers voyce, While she was innocent, deeere Ladies would I could divide my selfe, for being one, I cannot on the Theater of my minde, Act both a friend and lover, that two names Of so intire affinity should occasion So manifest a dissension, in a soule That would be true, yet is inforc'd, though loath, To forfeit one, or to be false to both. Chri. My expectation did not Sage this softnesse in you, I had thought You had come furnish'd with a full resolve To act your friends request. Vit. Yet I must needs Speake in a cause so moving; Madam thinke How much more noble tis in you to save, Then to destroy; behold three bleeding hearts Imploring pitty from you, mine, your sisters, And your adorer Dorias, which one word Of yours would ransome from approaching death, Oh be not sparing of that breath, 'twill sound In the just eares of heaven more sweet then prayers Offerd by Cloyster'd virgins, of resume Your native charity, and fulfill my suite, And in requitall of that sacred grant. Time shall depend like summer on your brow, And your whole life be one continued youth. Such were the springs in Paradise, and when You passe to be a sharer in heavens blisse, Virgins and innocent lovers spotlesse teares, Hardned to pearle by the stronge heate of sighes, Shall be your monument. Chr. This whole discourse Should you inlarge it to a volumne, cannot Alter my meanest thought, I only wish you As you are noble to respect your honour; That's all my answer. Exit. Eur. But doe you meane Uitelli, to performe what Doria has enjoyn'd you. Uit. I shall melt Into a willing pitty, if the flame Of friendship did not with its effectuall heat, Dry up love, moysture: deere Madam he That has commanded me this deathfull taske, Claimes such a lawfull Interest in my life, That spight of my affection, I must yield To his resistlesse will: yet I will love you So far as honour gives me warrant, and Wish you the best of women, the best joyes Happinesse can impart to you, farewell, 'Tis a befitting gratitude to give That life a being; by whose guift I live. Exit. Eur. sorrowes flow high; griefe unto griefe succeed, Wounds are more dangerous which doe inward bleed. Exit. Enter Adorni, and Frangipan. Ador. Come let not this dishearten you, your French Is a thing easily gotten, and when you have it, As hard to shake it off, runnes in your blood, As 'twere your mother language, but there is An observation farre more necessary T'improve your judgement, still let your discourse Concerne the forraigne businesse, and be sure To applaud out-landish fashions, and take off from What is native, as if you shall heare Any commend the Genoa garbe, or state Answer in France, in Naples, or in Spaine, No Matter where, so it be farre enough. From hence, they are more politicke, more witty; Every way more deserving, this will speake Infinitely judicious, when to praise Our owne domesticke manners, is as if A man should praise himselfe, and be accounted A selfe conceited gul for't. Fran. Very good, this is a rule Ile put in practice I, Thanks to my inclination can speake ill Of my owne father signior. Ador. Signoir; still, you betray your igorance, why signior, Mounsiuer has a farre more airy and harmonious sound, There's musicke in the letters, still polish your phrase With particles of language, which till I've taught you Perfectly answer with a shrug or nod, Or any forraigne gesture, such a silence Will be esteem'd for gravity, and become you better Then volubility of speech does some Whose tongues are gentlemen ushers to their wits, Still going before it, and when you doe speake, Let it not be, as now you doe of newes Abroach ten daies before, and quite drunke of; But what affaires are acted then in France, What in the English Court; and still remember T'extoll 'hem infinitely, and if any answer Comparatively with our owne a serious laughter, Will not become you ill, to shew how much You slight their error. Fran. Better still, I like this slighting humour infinitely, but how If they should talke of our Italian dames, I'me bound to be their Champion, for I've heard Strangers report, and I hold their opinion, Our Curtezans excell all other Nations. Ador. That shew'd those strangers judgements, and confirm'd What I would have you understand in England, Where publicke houses are prohibited: There are the bravest Lasses, here some Donsella That was the last night yours, shall for two Ducats To morrow be a Saylers: when there Your Citizens wives, girles fresh as ayre, and wholsome As pretious Candy wives will meet their Gamsters, At a convenient Taverne, rob their husbands Without a scruple, and supply their friends, While the good innocent Cuckolds pay a price For their owne horning. Fran. Excellent, excellent Genoa, I doe defie thy costive girles, Ile henceforth love these English sparkes of gold: Would I were there: it should goe hard but I Would graft on their Aldermens Coxecombs. Ador. Th'are grafted fast already sir, besides They ne're get Children, but their Hench boyes on Their Sergeants wives, after some City feast, When the provoking spirit of White broath, and Custard enflames their blood: what Genoa Burgesse Dares be so boldly courag'd: Ile tell you, And marke how base and sordid it appeares To have our Cellers stuff'd with Corsike Wines: Yet for this foolish sinne cald Temperance, Tantalize, and nere taste it, while your Dutch, Your noble-spirited German will carrouse A score of Goblets to provoke this stomacke To's bread and Butter; doe nothing but by discreete Counsell of drinke, not match his daughter to A man he sees not drunke first, scarce say's prayers Till he be full of liquor, which enflames The minde to generous actions. Fran. Commend 'hem, and will be glad to imitate. Ador. Your English Deserves as large applause, who to say truth, Out-drinks the Dutch, as is the common proverb, The Dutch-man drinks his buttons off, the English Doublet and all away, then marke their carraige: If two fall out and strike, and be by company Parted; though one weares in his face the badge Of his dishonour, which excites him to As brave revenge, not daunts him: for he'll straight Call out his enemy to a single Duell, Scorning his life; concerning the Lands lawes, Which doe forbid those combats, and ne're part Till one be slaine, and the survivour sure As death to hang for't. Fran. Excellent, I love a man that cares not for hanging. Ador. Then to their further glory, which takes off All the disgrace of halter, they are sure Ere they be scarce cold, to be Chronicled In excellent new Ballads, which being sung Ith' streets 'mong boyes and girles, Colliers, and Carmen, Are bought as great memorialls of their fames, Which to perpetuate, they are commonly stuck up With as great triumph in the tipling houses, As they were scutchions. Fran. Better: yet I'de give A hundred Ducats to be chronicled In such a historicall Canto: who composes them? Ador. They have their speciall Poets for that purpos Such as still drinke small Beere, and so are apt To spit out lamentable stuffe: then for their cloathes They hate a cut domesticke, but imitate The French precisely gallants, weare their long Parisian Breeches, with five poynts at knees, Whose tagges concurring with their harmonious spurres Afford rare musicke; then have they Doublets So short ith' waste, they seeme as 'twere begot Vpon their Doublets by their Cloakes, which to save stuffe Are but a yeares growth longer than their skirts; And all this magazine of device is furnish'd By your French Tayler: what Country man is yours? Fran. A Genoese. Ador. Fie, change him Monsieur, You have heard a Spanish Count's Lately arriv'd, without any advice, hou'd you salute him? Fran. Thus sir, after our Italian fashion. Ador. That's too vulgar; You must accost him thus with a state face, As if your beard had beene turn'd up that morning By advice of all the Barbers in the City, As you had drest you in a Looking-glasse, Proper to none but the Dukes privy Counsellors: Pronounce your Besolos manas with a grace, As if you were the sonne and heire, apparant To th'Adelantado of Castile. Enter Lactantio. Lact. Adorni, this is no time for mirth, Your noble General has slain Lord Bonivet, And for the act is a prisoner. Ador. Dares the state bereave him of his liberty, Without whose most unwearied valour, It had beene betray'd to slavery? Lac. You know Lord Bonivets alliance to the Duke. Ador. Allyance, death a thousand Bonivets, And Dukes and States, weigh not A scruple poys'd with his full worth. Lac. He's to be tryed ith' morning without noyse, For feare of mutiny, and tis suppos'd That if some virgin Lady doe not claime Her priviledge, and begge his life, he'll suffer. Fran. If the maid that begges must be above fifteene, Tis shrewdly doubted where she'll be found. Ador. All our virgins ought, if they have vertue, to contend For such a glory; but if all be squeamish, May all the daughters of our best Burgers runne Away with souldiers, and become Sutlers wives. Fran. Or else when they have a masculine itch upon 'hem, And would taste man, may they be wed to Eunuchs. Lact. else be forc'd to keepe their maiden-heads Till they be musty and not marchantable To younger brothers with additions of wealthy portions. Fran. May they when they would strive to mend their faces to allure a suitor, want paint and blacke-patches to stoppe the Crannies of their Cheekes; may their Pomatum bee mixt with Hogs-grease, that they may be abominable even in the nose of Iewes: may the green-sicknesse raigne in their bloods, and may they be debar'd of oate meale, and clay-wall, and fall to Rats-bauc. Ador. May their parents turne most precise precisians, And forbid em the sight of playes, or they may never Dance unlesse be to a bag-pipe or a Crowd. Fran. May they want silkes for gownes, and if they seeke Supply from Naples, let them insteed, be furnish'd With their Disease; may Millaners breake and Feather-men, May my Aunt dye suddenly, and bury with her All her devises; may there be no Earth Found to make looking-glasses, that they come to use of Kitchen-wenches, dresse their heads by the reflexion of a Paile of water, or in a pewter chamber vessell. Ador. Lactantio, let's go wayte the Generall In prison, 'twould be base should we neglect him in His extremity. Exeunt. Enter Doria, and Sabelli. Dor. Is it confirm'd hee's dead? Sab. The generall voyce Divulges so ith' City; and the Duke Has sent an order which commands you forth I'th morning to your tryall: my deare Lord I hope the service you have done the State Abroad, will here at home secure your life From the Lawes violent Rigour. Dor. Yes poore boy, If thou mightst be thy masters judge Sabelli, I am at the period of my fate, and would not Have thee a sad spectator of my fall At home, whom thou so oft hast waited on Abroad in triumph, therefore gentle heart, Returne home to thy mother, and survive To serve a happier master. Sab. My noble Lord Have I so often followed you, when death Attended on each step, when every hurt That scar'd your noble body, I have wish'd Imprinted on my flesh, and with my teares, Even drown'd the purple deluge of your wounds, That as my truth and loyalties reward, I must be turn'd away unkindly, when My last and justest service might declare My zeale to you my master; Oh sir, You more afflict my innocence with these words, Then if sad truth had brought me the report Of my owne mothers funerall, and should you Enforce me leave you, the succeeding care, And labour of my life should be consum'd In a perpetuall weeping. Dor. Good Sabelli Cease this afflicting language, lest I grow as Childish as thy selfe, and burst into teares To beare thee company. Sab. Besides my Lord, When your blest soule does on immortall wings Arrive at heaven who shall attend it there, the Saints and Angels will esteeme themselves Worthy to be your fellowes, while my poore And humble Ghost would reckon it a blisse To waite on you, as carefully as when We liv'd on earth together, deere my Lord, Let me dy with you, death and I have beene Play-fellowes these many yeares, he'l only bring me To rest as pleasing to my sence as sleepe After a tedious watching. Dor. This kinde passion shakes my Most masculine temper; heere Sabelli Accept this Gold, these Iewells, as the last Gift of thy perishing Lord, thou shalt accept 'em; If the law doe not passe upon my life, Ile send for thee agen, I prethee leave me, I would be private, and thy presence does Disturbe my serious thoughts. Sab. Nay then tis time for Me the wretched'st soule on earth to take My lasting farewell of you; all the joyes Of blest eternity in stead of my Desertlesse service; waite upon your life; You ne're shall view your boy agen, for sure if your Light be extinguish'd, my weake flame Cannot continue burning; give me licence To kisse your honour'd hand, and to let fall A parting drop or two: and now farewell For ever noble Lord; that greefe appeares most true, That's writ in blood as well as teares. Exit. Dor. Poore boy; I have not yet deserv'd so ill But my untimely fate excites some pitty. Enter Adorni, Lactantio, and Frangipan. Adorni thou art come to see the last And greatest of thy Generalls actions, Which like a cunning and well mannag'd scene, not till the period will disclose the plot Or my lifes Tragedy. Ador. Your life my Lord; Death dare not venture to invade it, and The state as soone will call the enemy Into their City, as pretend the least Danger to their supporting Columne, which Should it but shake, it might dismantle their Best Bulwarkes, burne their Navy, and surrender Themselves to present slavery. Lact. The Duke, Though he did hold his kinsman deere, will value The publique good before his private ruine. Fran. Let the Duke doe his worst, and all the state Stand on Pontilios, I can fetch a Lady Of excellent quality shall beg your Lordship, Ile make her doo't. Ador. Nay, should all fayle you sir, Should the States angers, and the Dukes partiall sentence, The peoples malice bandy to surprize The treasure of your life; know you have friends Would fixe the heads of halfe the Towne upon Their Lances poynts, ere your least drop of blood Should be diminished. Dor. Gentlemen, I thank you All your loves; but know the shape of Death Is not ougly to me, but if justice Contract me to the monster, I shall court it As 'twere some beauteous Bride; and think the Axe That like the Priest, unites me to a Spouse That will not play the woman and revolt. Come Gentle-men let's in, brave soules doe hate, To be dejected by the force of Fate. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Enter Chrisea, Enrione, Vitelli. Chri. I am very sorry that his Fate has cast Such a disastrous chance upon his Life: But his desert will blunt the edge of justice, And mitigate the severity, which would Question the safety of his Life. Vit. Tis in your mercy To dash the Lawes proceedings, gracious Madam, The Priviledge that our Country gives your Sexe, Can hope for no imployment, that will rayse A greater Trophee to your fame, then this To ransome him, whose constancy and truth Exceeds all boast of Stories. Enr. You'l redeeme The opinion of your piety, which scandall, Should you omit this just and righteous taske, Would blast with blackest infamy. Chri. You plead in your owne cause, not his, t'does not beseem My modesty to interpose my selfe In that which nought concernes me. Uit. Is his life Of such a triviall value in your thoughts, That you esteem't not worthy your intreats, To sav't from killing, ruine, sacred love, Thou miracle of Mature, and delight Of all who know humanity with some Religious arrow pierce her flinty breast, Some pious shaft, on whose subduing point Pitty and amorous softnesse gently sit, Reduce this straying Schismaticke to the first Vnspotted purenesse of her constant faith, And we will pay a thousand clouds of sighes, As incense to thy Altars. Eur. Offer up Miriads of virgin vowes and with our teares Extinguish all irregular flames that taint Thy holy fries. Uit. Oh Madam What heart so barbarous, does not at loves smiles Put off the native tiercenesse, beasts with beasts, Observe his lawes; the Lyons whose big breath Affrights the trembling people of the woods, Were his hoarse accents to be understood, They would appeare to be affections groves. The Nightingale that on lascivious wings Flies from the poplar to the trembling Beech, And on each bough chaunts melancholy notes, Had he a humane utterance, would proclaime Those pensive straines, the musicke of his love; And can yee be lesse sensible of a power, That is so great, then creatures bard the use Of sacred reason, and discourse? Chri. This is to seeke to pacifie the sea With teares; Vitelli you mistake, your friend Values not at so deere a rate his life, As to receive a being tributary To my unask'd entreats, besides I should Envy the states prerogative, whose mercy Is in remitting his unwilling fault, But a becomming thankefulnesse, and should Be censur'd, as too partiall to my owne Affection should I strive to be his wife, Whose hand is purpled with the innocent blood Of my late murdered kinsman. Eur. This concernes As neerely me as you, but by just truth, Though I'me ingag'd by my particular choyce To my Vitelli, were I sure the Generall Would not contemne my offer, and so blast My future fame, I would disclaime all tyes Of former fancy; and implore his safety. Vit. This is a sweetnesse Which I cold wish you, what has begot This strange desertion of your faith, true love, Being once receiv'd into the soule converts Into its very essence, does become The same eternall substance, can you then Teare from the tender Cabinet of your brest Your very heart? this cruelty exceeds The depth of tyranny; but rest assur'd, If Doria suffer by your proud contempt, I'me freed then from my promise, and will sooner Warme an empoysoning Scorpion in my armes, Then yeeld my meanest thought to you who are By evident circumstance, though not by fact, My friend the Generalls murdresse. Chri This Vitelli Is not a meanes to winne me to your friend, But more avert me from him, it inflames My minde with holier fire to Court your love; There is an evident beauty in your soule, Equall to truest honor, I will cherish This bravery in you, if your masculine fancy Engages you thus constant, to a friend, You'l be a loyall husband, fare you well, Be still thus noble, and be happy. Exit. Eur. My sister Has lost all sence of pitty; deere Vitelli, There is no wretchednesse oppressing earth Equall to ours, love thus the Tyrant playes, Afflicting innocence by unusuall waies. Exeunt. Enter Doria as a prisoner, Lactantio, Adorni, to them Trivulci, Senators, Officers, and Attendants. Ador. Tis like your selfe my noble Lord, but see The Duke approaching, let your soule expect An equall hearing. Offic. Beare backe, roome for the Duke and Senate, what Cuckold's that would have his Coxcombe broake? beare backe there. Triv. Cite in the prisoner. Offic. Hee's here my Lord. Tri. I'me sorry that You for whose head the gratitude of the state Decreed triumphant bayes should be enforc'd To stand here a delinquent, but the law Must as a streight and uncorrupted streame Enjoy its usuall freedome, my Lords, We are not met here to arraigne a prisoner, Whose guilt does speake his sentence, but a person Not only most unblemish'd in his fame, But one to whom our country owes its life: Who with his dearest blood has balm'd the wounds Which michiefes giant-off-springs, raysing warre, Cut in the bosome of the common-wealth. Sen. We all confesse his worth. Tri. Yet this brave youth, This patron of our liberty, all his honours, His blood and titles, his defensive bayes (That would have guarded his victorious front From blasts of lightning) laid aside, is come To tender satisfaction to the lawes, He has offended, and since judgement is The immediate act of Justice, it must passe To save impartiall censure on his life, As on the wretched'st malefactors; for His former merits cannot take away His present fault; for who ere is guilty Vndoes the priviledge of his desert and blood; For if great men offending passe unpunish'd, The common people who doe use to sinne, By their example fearelesse, will runne on Into licencious wickednesse. Sen. Your grace delivers The intension of the state, no oracle Could have explain'd the meaning of our lawes With more integrity. Tri. Yet my good Lords, I speake not this, that my particular vengeance, Because slew he my kinsman, has the least Ayme at his life, which I would strive to cherish As my owne health, or as the Cities peace, For Magistrates ought to behold their crimes, Not the committers, as the Poets faine Of wise Tyresias, to want eyes, and only Have seeing understanding, for a judge Is guilty of the fault he does not punish, And if rewards and triumphs doe adorne Deserts tis just that shame and punishments Should wait on vices, and how much more worthy The person is that acts them, so farre sharper Should be the penalty inflicted on him. Sen. And when the law Vses its utmost rigor, tis the crime, And not the man it sentences. Tri. In briefe We must Decline his merit, and forget Our gratitude, and since his hand is dipt In civill blood, his life must expiat what His arme unfortunately committed. Dor. My Lords, The services which I have done the state, Were but my naturall duty, I atchieved 'em To gaine me fame and glory, and you safety, and Should esteeme them Traytors to honour, if their intercession Be a protection for my crimes, I meane not To plead to save a dis-respected life, Cause I feare death, a sea incompass'd rocke Is not lesse timerous of the assaulting waves, Then I of the grimme monster, but there is A fame surviving which I would be loath, Should tell posterity I tamely yeelded My head to th'Axe, and dyed because my spirit Durst not desire to live to quit this scandall, I hope what I can urge in my defence Shall have indifferent hearing. Tri. Speake freely. Dor. Know then my intention Is not by excuse to extenuate my fact, Which I confesse most horrid, and woud I pay A thousand showers of sorrow, could this hand Reedifie that goodly fram of flesh Which it demolisht, but my pricelesse fame, In whose deere cause I slew him, will to justice Boldly proclaime, I did no more then what The truth I owe my reputation tells me, Was right in poynt of honor. Tri. But the law Does disallow it as unjust, and that Must be your judge, and not that idle breath Which you abusively terme honor. Dor. Your lawes cannot without partiality pronounce Iudgement against me, for they doe acquit That man of guilt that to defend his life Is forc'd to slay his enemy; my act Carries the same condition, since my fame, Whose safety urg'd me to kill him, is my life, My immortall life, as farre transcending this As the soule does the body, for the sword, Returnes that to its primitive matter dust, And there it rests forgotten, but a wound Strucke upon reputation, leaves a brand, So selfe diffusive is dishonors guilt, Even to posterity, and does revive After t'has sufferd martyrdome. Sen. Yet this Cannot excuse your fact, for civill reason Allowes a reparation for the losse Of same, but gives no man a lawfull licence To snatch the priviledge from the hands of justice, Which would dispose it equally. Dor. This strictnesse destroyes all Right of manhood, since a coward May fearefully relying on this sufferage Of Law affront even valors selfe, consider That the most cunning Pilot cannot steere mans Brittle vessell 'twixt these dangerous Rocks Of law and honor safely, sayle by this, And on that suffer shipwracke, for suppose I had with patience borne this scandalous name Of a degenerate coward, I not only had Nip'd the budding valor of my youth, As with a killing frost, but left a shame inherent To our family, disgrac'd My noble fathers memory, defam'd Nay cowarded my Ancestors, whose dust, Would 'a broke through the Marbles, to revenge To me this fatall infamy. Ador Well urg'd, and resolutely. Dor. Nay more, your selves That hate the deed being done; would have detested The doer worse had it not beene perform'd Withdrawne my chardge ith' army; as from one Protested for a coward, I might then Have abjur'd the trade of warre, in which I have beene nurs'd, Yet for preserving this unvalued jemme Of pretious honour that hangs on my soule, Like a well polish'd Iewell in the eare, Of the exactest beauty, must I suffer The lawes sterne rigor. Tri. Sir I should refute With circumstance your wrong opinion, but in briefe, Religious conscience, utterly disclaimes An act so barbarous to take mans life, Is to destroy Heavens Image, and if those Are held as Traytors, and the law inflicts Severest tortures on them, who deface The stamps of Princes in their coyne, can they appeare, As guiltlesse whose rude hands disgrace The great Creators Image, and commit Treason 'gainst awfull nature; Oh my Lord Collect your serious temper, and put off The over weening fantasies of youth, Consider what a vaine deluding breath Is reputation, if compar'd with life. Thinke that an idle, or detracting word May by a faire submission (which our lawes Of honor doe require it will enforce) Be wash'd away, but the red guilt of blood Sticks as a blacke infection to the soule, That like an Ãthiop cannot be wash'd white, A shout within. Thinke upon this, and know I must with griefe Enter Corimba and Frangipan. pronounce your fatall sentence.â Fran. Doe you heare Generall, Ile tell you newes, you were in leopardy to have had your little weason slit; but I pronounce The happy word, be safe; his peece of beauty, By my perswasions does intend to take The edge of law off, and become your wife, True and inseparable. Cor. With reverence to this presence, my good Lords, Know that I come not urg'd by heate of youth. Fran. Tis true Ile beare her witnesse. Cor. Or any wanton or unchast desire To beg this gentleman for my husband, neither To raise my selfe a fortune by the match, But mov'd in charity, and provok'd in minde, With pitty to behold a man so proper, Brought to an end untimely, by a death So scandalous to honour as the Axe, I come to crave our priviledge, and desire him For my most lawfull husband. Tri. Gentle mayd Your piety does prompt you to an act That shall engage your country to erect A statue to your memory, though I could not Dispence with justice, yet since there's a meanes Without the lawes infringement, to preserve him, I doe rejoyce as much as if my sonne Had scap'd apparant danger: goe on and prosper In your designe. Dor. Doe you thinke because I pleaded For my honours life, I doate so much upon this idle breath, As to preserv't with infamy, dispose This womanish priviledge to submissive slaves, Know that I hate a being that depends Upon anothers bounty more then death, At which my soule does, like an Eagle stretch its Silver wings, and ore the monsters head Will make flight at heaven; pray sir proceed To judgement suddenly, delay begets More tortors in me then your sentence. Cor. What doe you meane sir, pray let me understand you Better, looke upon me, I am no woman to be slighted. Fra. She's not asham'd to shew her face, marry her Uncle, that I may call you so. Sen. To wed this figure, is a farre greater punishment then Death. Ador. Nere stand on tearmes, but marry her, and free your selfe, and trust to me, you shall not want a mistresse has better colours in her face. Dor. Corimba, I'me much engag'd to your officious haste, And pay you many thankes, conceive not that I doe contemne your person or dislike The meannesse of your match, for were your beauty Created for a miracle, and adorn'd With the addition of a fortune ampler, Then that perfection, I should crave a licence To tell your modesty I am prepar'd Rather for death then Nuptialls, and no strength Of prayers and beauty, shall have power to tempt me From my fixt resolution. Tri. This is madnesse not courage Doria. Cor. Sir I must tell you, you know not how to use a woman rightly Perhaps tis bashfulnesse, take courage sir, I have reserv'd my deere virginity This fifty yeares for such a pious purpose, And should you slight me now, I should forswear Good purposes hereafter: gentlemen perswade him, Sure he cannot chuse but melt At your entreaties. Tri Will you then pull your ruine on; that seeks Recorders. Enter Uitelli, and Sabelli, as a Lady. Virgins. Thus easily to flye from you; Iustice calls On me to give your sentenceânew interruptions It is the voyce of musicke, and presages An Omen as harmonious as its notes, Approach faire troops of Virgins, here's subject, Fit for your maiden pity. Cor. Tis time for mee to take my farewell, these may bee beauties, perhaps my Lady may bee one, adiew sir; you may be offer'd worse. Ex. Cor. and Fran. Sab. My honour'd Lord, The charity I owe my native country, That in the ruine of this brave young man, Would suffer infinitly, has forc'd us strive With earely zeale first to present our duties For his redemption, 'mong ten thousand Virgins That would attempt it, and my true affection Has wonne this favour from my fellowes, that To me they yield their interest, which I claime As my desir'd prerogative. Tri. Tis an act the State will thanke you for; unvaile your selfe, That we may know to whom we owe our gratitude, A most excelling beauty, such an eye Would tempt religious coldnesse to a flame, Thaw Ages chilly frost, at such a cheeke The Spring might take a patterne to create, A most accomplish'd freshnesse; in her looks, Are modest signes of innocence, such as Saints Weare in their liveliest counterfeits: Doria, here A Lady begs you, whom if you refuse, The times would blacke you with the hatefull title Of your owne wilfull murther; take her to you And live a fortunate husband. Dor. Noble maid, my misery is so extreame a sinne, It cannot meet your bounty without breach Of vowes; which should I violate, would pull Eternall torments on me; keep your beauty For one whose soule, free as the ayre he breaths, Can yield a mutuall fancy to your flame, And not destroy his honour, for your goodnesse Since my expir'd date, cannot yield you thanks Worthy the boundlesse merit of your love, If there can be a gratitude after death Express'd by prayers, my soule in heaven shall pay it To your kind charity. Sab. Oh my Lord, I did expect this answer, my poore worth Cannot deserve your value; yet there is A constant purity in my thoughts, that intend you So much of Blisse, that had your safety no Dependance on my suit, it would be deem'd Most cruell to contemne me, I have lov'd you These many yeares; wish'd you as many glories As I have number'd dayes, have vow'd I never Will marry any man, but your blest selfe my Lord, Should you neglect the justnesse of my request, Besides the danger waiting on your life, A thousand Virgins, whose unspotted prayers Like hosts of guardian Angels, would have borne You on their wings to heaven, will for my sake Convert their zeale to curses, and in teares Of anguish drowne your memory. Vit. Why friend, this is Such an o're-weening passion, as does question The soundnesse of your judgement, fills the world With a conceit you dye; because your feares Dare not accept of life: Besides your Mistris, To whom you would so strictly keepe your faith, Does so much scorne your constancy, that no Entreats could move her pitty undertake This honourable imployment. Tri. Doe it with speedy diligence. Dor. Her causelesse frailty Shall more confirme my truth: My Noble Lord pronounce My happy sentence, 'twill be welcome to me Enter Priest &amp; Executioner. As charming harmony, and swell my brest With more than humane pleasure. Tri Are you come? approach, Behold this Executioner, and this Priest, This is to wed you to destruction, that To this rich Mine of purity: your choyse May accept either: if you fixe on this, Besides your owne redemption, you enjoy A Lady, who may clayme as many hearts As she has vertuous thoughts; but leane to that, Your Spring returnes unpittyed, to the rude Armes of perpetuall winter, that will freeze you To a ne're melting Isicle, be suddaine, And wise in your election. Dor. Tis but vaine: a Saint may sooner be o're-come to sell His native Piety: come thou grim man, Thou art to me more lovely then the face of perfect Beauty: Do thy office, it will free me From these perplexities. Sab. Well my Lord, Since I'me unworthy to enjoy in life Your faire society, my soule shall hast To waite on you to death, there is no blisse Without your presence, since you will not have Mercy on your owne life, by your example Ile be as harsh to mine, Ile goe Before you to the other world, And be your lov'd Ghosts Harbenger. Tri. Hold, hold the Ladyâ Sab. Let no hand presume to seize me, For the meanest touch that shall Endeavour to prevent my will Shall urge my speedier ruine: Good my Lord, Shall I have answer? I would fayne be going On my long journy. Dor. I'me confounded In my imagination, I must yield, You have enforc'd a benefit upon me, I Can hardly thank you for, yet I will try To love you as my wife; that I were lost In Clouds of black forgetfulnesse. Tri. My Lord, Your pardon's seal'd as soone as by the Priest You are conjoyn'd in marriage: Ile not leave you Till't be someniz'd, Hymen light thy Pine, Deaths tapers fade at the cleare flame of thine. Exeunt. The end of the fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Enter Trivulci, Doria, Sabelli, Adorni, Priest and Uirgins. Tri. Is the Priest prepar'd For his Hymne after Nuptialls, and the virgins Ready to gratulate the Bride, and Bridegroome With the appoynted dance? Ador. The Priest I thinke Has the song perfect, but it is a question Among the wisest, whether in the City There be seven Virgins to be found to furnish Recorders. The dance as't should be; but you must accept them With all their faults; this musicke speaks their enterance. Enter Virgins. Song. Triumph appeare, Hymen invites Thee to wait upon this feast, Mixe thy joyes with his delights, 'Tis the Generall is chiefe guest.

Come bright vertues that reside In heaven, as in your proper spheare, Though all contain'd in the faire bride, Chastity doe thou first appear, With Temperance and innocent grace, Rose-colourd Modesty and truth, Dance harmlesse measures in this place, With health, and a perpetuall youth: And all your Virgin Trophies bring away, To grace these Nuptialls, Triumphs Holyday. A Dance. Tri. You have our hearty thanks, and we shal study To give you faire requitall; come my Lord Erect your drowsie spirits, let your soule Dance ayry measures in your jocund breast; This is a day on which each Bridegroome ought To weare no earth about him; ayre and fire Are Hymens proper elements, your mirth Ought to infuse into your frolicke guests, An humour apt for revelling and sport: Your disposition is more dull, than if You were to be chiefe mourner at a Coarse: For shame shake off this sadnesse. Ador. It becomes you to say truth scurvily, I doe not like it, You looke as if y'ad lost some victorie, Of which your hope had an assurance: Shall I tell your Lordship A very pleasant story? Enter Vitelli. Dor. It must be, if it be delightfull to me, a discourse Of some quicke meanes to free me from this cruell Oppressive weight of flesh, which does entombe My martyr'd soule, that like to sulphury fire Hid in a Mountains entrayles, strives to burst The prison, and flye upwards; it must needs Be a sad wedding, when the Bridegroome weares His Nuptiall livery on his eyes in teares. Vit. Friend, this is A passion too effeminate for a heart Endu'd with manly courage; things past helpe Should be past thought, your sadnesse casts a Cloud Upon the lustre of this Ladyes looks, You make her dimme the brightnesse of her eyes With unbecomming teares, if you continue This strange distraction. Sab. Alas my Lord, Let me participate your cause of sorrow, And be a willing partner in your griefe, Which like a violent Current that o're-flowes The neighbouring fields and medowes in its rage, Into two streames divided, smoothly runnes, Kissing with calme lips the imprisoning banks, Would, though too mighty for you, when my soule Should vent a part of it, be milde, and passe Away without disturbance of your peace, Which to procure I would even burst my heart With sighes devoted to your quiet, and Become a loving fountaine by my teares I shed without intermission. Dor. Gentle Lady, I am at such an enmity with fate, Makes me incapable of ought but griefe, But I shall study to declare how much Enter Eurione, Chrisea, Corim. Lact. &amp; Bon. I am indebted to your careâgood heaven Send downe some Angell to protect my heart, Or my religion will scarce stay my hand, For acting wilfull violence on my life, I have suckt poyson from her eyes, that will Like to juyce of Hemlocke drowne my soule In a forgetfull Lethargy, or oppresse My temperate faculties with madnesse. Tri. Cosen y'are welcome, know this vertuous Lady Who has redeem'd the Generall. Chri. Sir, ime come to gratulate your beauteous bride, and wish you joyes immortall. Sab. I hope Madam, my innocence has gi'n you no offence, That you refuse me, being a stranger to you. The Ceremonious wishes, which pertaine To new made Brides, and onely doe conferre them Vpon my Lord. Chri. Your happinesse already Is so superlative, I cannot thinke A new addition to it, you enjoy The very summe of fortune in your match, To such a noble and illustrious husband. I no longer can hold my passion in, These walls of flesh are not of Strength sufficient to contayne My big swolne heart: My Lords behold a creature So infinitely wretched, I deserve not The meanest shew of pitty, who have, like A silly merchant, trifled away a jemme, The darling of the quarry, lost a love By my too foolish nicenesse, to regaine Whose forfeiture I would lay downe my life: But he is gone for ever, and I left A pittious spectacle for the reproach And scorne of wiser women. Eur. Is this possible? Was all her passion to Vitelli feign'd? My hopes recover life agen. Tri. Why Chrisea, Whence springs this passionate fury? Chri. Oh my Lord, When you shall heare it, you will sigh for me, And shed a charitable teare, at thought Of my unkinde disaster: sir my Justice Cannot accuse your constancy, which stood In the first tryall of your love, as fast And spotlesse as an Alablaster rocke, That had it but persisted in that height Of honourable loyalty, your glory Had been advanc'd to heaven, as the fix't starre, To guid all lovers through the rough Seas of affection. Uit. This taxation Cannot be just from you, who did enforce The sad revolt upon him. Dor. Is there in heaven no friendly Boult left that will strike this frame into The center, and set free a wretch (So overgrowne with misery) from life, That death would be a comfort above health, Or any worldly blessing, may time blot my name out Of his Booke, that such a Prodigy May not affright succession, nor sticke Like an orespreading Leprosie upon The beautious face of manhood. Chri. Oh my Lord, each griefe of which Y'are sensible, is mine, and not your Torment, every sigh you breath is an Afflicting motion, expir'd by my vext Spirit, and if you could weepe, each drop Would be my blood, who am the spring Of the whole flood of sorrow; oh forgive The too exceeding honor of my love, I would Have had you for your perfect truth so glorious; Your loyalty should not for Preservation of your fame, have needed To adopt a statue for its heire, or builded a Monumentall pyramid, but love Is ofttimes loves undoing. Tri. This is such A cunning la byrin of Sorrow, that no clew Can lead them out of. Dor. It would be A great affront to misery, should there live A person halfe so wretched to out-dare The strength of my affliction, me thinkes Ime like some aged mountaine that has stood In the seas watry bosome, thousand shocks Of threatning tempests, yet by th'flattering waves, That cling and curle about his stony limbes, Is undermind and ruind, I have scap'd Warres, killing, dangers, and by peacefull love, Suffer a strange subversion, Oh Chrisea, While I have reason left that can distinguish Things with a coole and undistracted sence, Let's argue mildly the unhappy cause Of our undoings. Eur. Truely sister, 'Twas a suspicious rashnesse, I could wish You never had attempted. Chri. My Lord, Humane condition alwaies censures things By their event, my aimes have had successe So strangely haplesse, that will blast the truth Of their intentions purity, I never Harbor'd the least suspicion of your faith, Which I did strive to perfect, by the test, As richest gold refind, and purg'd From drosse of other baser metals, and besides The triall of your constancy, I meant To sound Vitellies depth; upon whose love My sister doted, so that I was loath To see her cast the treasure of her heart Upon a stranger, of whose constancy She had too small assurance. Tri. Gentle Cosen, Your good intents encounter'd bad successe, But I admire, since you must needs have notice Of his disaster, that the law would passe Upon his life, you did not to prevent. All other virgin intercessors haste To pay the early tribute of your love. Chri. My wretched fate With a too quicke prevention has orethrowne The justnesse of my purpose, I relyed so much upon his noblenesse, I thought The ugly horror of a thousand deaths Could not have mov'd his temper, and besides, Knowing his mighty courage, I permitted The law proceed upon him, that hereafter He might be sure no merit can appease Offended justice, otherwise I could Easily have stop'd this mischiefe. Enter Bonivet. Tri. How Chrisea? I understand you not. Chri. Lady, to quit all scruple that I doe not wish Yours and your Lords succeeding happinesse, Ile offer Something as an oblation that shall adde Peace to your nuptiall garland (see my Lord) My Cosen Bonivet lives. Tri. Lives? Lactantio did not you informe us That he was dead, and you had caus'd his body To be prepar'd for funerall? which occasioned The Generalls suddaine tryall, because our custome Does not permit the corpes to be entomb'd, Before the murderer have his sentence, sir you shall know What tis to mocke the state thus. Lact. Good my Lord Heare but my just excuse, I am so much the faire Chriseas beauty's by such ties Oblig'd to serve her, that I choose to hazzard The anger of the state ere her displeasure, And doe submit me to your gracious censure. Chri. I must confirm't, Sir it was I who caus'd him to conceale My Cosen Bonivet, for the causes which I did declare before, and now my selfe Having receiv'd a satisfying proofe Of his affection, came resolv'd to cleare These misty errors, but my cruell fate Has like a suddaine storme which has beate downe A goodly field of standing Corne even ripe For the laborious sickle, crush'd my hopes In one sad minute into nothing. Sab. My Lord I owe Such an obedient duty to your peace, That though my heart does wish to waite on yours For ever; since I see betwixt this Lady And you such firme apparences of love, If the law please to allow it, I resigne My interest to her and be fortunate To see you two live happy. Vit. Since the marriage Has not arriv'd to consummating act, I doe beleeve this may be done. Tri. Doe not delude Your favour with vaine hopes, the law cannot Dispense with the strict Cannon, tis impossible You should be separated. Dor. This happinesse Was too extreamely good to be confirm'd To such a wretch as I am: I am like One that did dreame of a huge masse of wealth, And catching at it, grasp'd the fleeting ayre, And waking grieves at the delusion. Sab. Sir resume your antient quiet, the formall Love shall not oppose your peace, Ile disanull The marriage easily, and most noble Lord Pardon your humble servant. Dor. Sure this is Some apparition to confirme my faith, Speake, art thou my Sabelli. Vit. Yes tis he, fate would not suffer two such Noble soules to be so disunited, gentle boy, Thy duty to thy Master will continue, Thy name in story, as the great example Of loyalty in servants. Sab. 'Twas the zeale I ought in duty to my Mrs. life, Hath put me on the attempt, which if he pardon, I'me fully satisfied. Dor. My joyes does with a suddain extasie oppresse My fraile mortality, and J should sinke, Wert not for my supporters, my Sabelli, Thou hast restor'd two lovers to their blisse, Whose gratitude shall pay to thy desert The tribute of their hearts: Deare Madam, now I hope your scrupulous doubts will remaine free From any new suspition. Chri. Since I have scap'd the danger past, beleeve ile avoyd The like hereafter; my Lord please you confirme My choyse; and let my sister be dispos'd To good Vitelli, he deserves her. Tri. Your wishes are fulfild, Cosen Bonivet welcome to life Agen; you and the Generall must be friends. Dor. Your goodnesse will pardon my misfortune? Bon. And desire to be esteem'd your servant. Enter Frangipan. Fran. With your leave gentlemen: Madam I have such newes to tell you, as will tickle your understanding, to beleeve the Generall is married; and more, Signior Doria, Lord Bonivet lives; That's lucky newes for you. Dor. He's here, good Signior Frangipan. Fran. My newes has ever the worst lucke; J must resolve to leave it off. Ador. But sir J have some suddaine newes to tell you: The thousand Ducats you contracted to pay me, When you could understand the French as perfectly As my selfe; by all these Lords indifferent judgement is Due on this very minute. Fran. This is newes indeed; you do not mean to make a gul of me, a figo for a thousand Ducats: as I am a gentleman I know not French for any thing, not for an Asse: good your grace let mee not be abus'd. Cor. 'Twas I my Lord who made the bargaine with him, The mony is not due untill my Cozen Have French as perfect as himselfe. Dor. He has, ile beare him witnesse; for Adorni Speakes not one true French word. Fran. How not one true French Word? Ador. No not a word, you must disburse. Fran. Tutor, ile tell you newes, You made a foole of mee, I could abuse him horribly, If I durst for feare of beating. Ador. My Lord If he will undertake warres, Ile quit my bargayne. Fran. Ile pay it trible first, the name of warre Has brought an age on me. Tri. You two agree that: Cozens I rejoyce To see this happy period of your loves. Let's backe unto the Temple, that the Priest May by his sacred power unite your hearts. Lead to the Temple. Exeunt.</field>
