      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Countess of Rousillon's House. Enter Bertram, the Countess of Rousillon, Helena Dumain, Lewis, and Lafeu. Countess. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband. Ber. And I, in going, Madam, weep o'er my father's death anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection. Count. What hope is there of his majesty's amendment? Laf. He hath abandon'd his physicians, Madam, under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope; and finds no other advantage in the process, but only the losing of hope by time. Count. This young gentlewoman had a father (O, that had! how sad a passage 'tis!) whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch'd so far, it would have made nature immortal. 'Would, for the king's sake, he were living! Laf. How call'd you the man you speak of, Madam? Count. He was famous, sir, in his profession; and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon. Laf. He was excellent, indeed, madam; the king very lately spoke of him, admiringly, and mourningly.â Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon? Count. His sole child, my lord; and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good, that her education promises: disposition she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer: for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity, they are virtues and traitors too; in her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty, and atchieves her goodness. Laf. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears. Count. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart, but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. Your time calls on you. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father In manners as in shape! thy blood and virtue Contend for empire in thee; and thy goodness Share with thy birth-right! What heaven more will, That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down, Fall on thy head! Farewell, my son; I'll bring you on your way. Laf. Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of your father. [Exeunt. Hel. Oh, were that all!âI think not on my father; And these great tears grace his remembrance more, Than those I shed for him. What was he like? I have forgot him: my imagination Carries no favour in it, but Bertram's Parolles (within.) Par. Holloa! where are these Knaves? Hel. Who comes here? One that goes with him: I love him for his sake; And yet I know him a notorious liar: Think him a great way fool, solely a coward; Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him, That they take place, when virtue's steely bones Look bleak in the cold wind. Enter Parolles. Par. What, is the Count gone?âLittle Helen farewell; if I can remember thee, I will think of thee at court. Hel. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star. Par. Under Mars, I. When he was predominant. Hel. When he was retrograde, I think, rather. Par. Why think you so? Hel. You go so much backward when you fight. Par. That's for advantage. Hel. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you, is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well. Par. I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends: get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee; so farewell. [Exit. Hel. I am undone; there is no living, none, If Bertram be away. It were all one, That I should love a bright particular star, And think to wed it, he is so above me: In his bright radiance and collateral light Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. The ambition in my love thus plagues itself: The hind, that would be mated by the lion, Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, tho' a plague, To see him every hour; to sit and draw His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, In our heart's table; heart, too capable Of every line and trick of his sweet favour!â But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy Must sanctify his relics. [Exit. SCENE II. The Countess's Garden. Enter Countess and Steward. Count. He's gone, and 'tis weakness to mourn over his departure. I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman? Enter Clown. What does this knave here?âGet you gone, sirrah! Clo. Madam, 'tis not unknown to you that I am a poor fellow. Count. Well, sir. Clo. No, madam, 'tis not so well, that I am poor; though many of the rich are damn'd: but if I have your ladyship's good-will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may. Count. Wilt thou needs be a beggar? Clo. I do beg your good-will in this case. Count. In what case? Clo. In Isbel's case, and mine own. Service is no heritage; and, I think, I shall never have the blessing of Heaven, till I have issue of my body; for, they say, bearns are blessings. Count. Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon. Stew. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you; of her I am to speak. Count. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her: Helen I mean. Clo. âWas this fair face the cause, quoth she, [Singing. âWhy the Grecians sacked Troy? âFond done, done fond; for Paris he, âWas this king Priam's joy? âWith that she sighed as she stood, âAnd gave this sentence then; âAmong nine bad if one be good, âThere's yet one good in ten.â Count. What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah. Clo. One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying o' the song: 'Would Heaven would serve the world so all the year! we'd find no fault with the tythe-woman, if I were the parson: One in ten, quoth 'a! an' we might have a good woman born but every blazing star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well; a man may draw his heart out, ere he pluck one. Count. You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you. Clo. That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done!âI am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither. [Exit. Count. Well, now. Stew. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely. I was very late more near her, than, I think, she wish'd me: alone she was, and did communicate to herself, her own words to her own ears. Her matter was, she lov'd your son: Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love, no god, that would not extend his might, only where qualities were level. This she deliver'd in the most bitter touch of sorrow, that e'er I heard a virgin exclaim in: which I held it my duty speedily to acquaint you withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it. Count. You have discharg'd this honestly; keep it to yourself: many likelihoods inform'd me of this before.â Pray you, leave me. I will speak with you further anon. [Exit Steward. Enter Helena. Count. Even so it was with me, when I was young: Her eye is sick on't; I observe her now.â Hel. What is your pleasure, madam? Count. You know, Helen, I am a mother to you. Hel. Mine honourable mistress. Count. Nay, a motherâ Heav'n's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood, To say, I am thy mother? What's the matter? Weep you, that you are my daughter? Hel. That I am not. Count. I say, I am your mother. Hel. Pardon, Madam. The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother: I am from humble, he from honour'd name; No note upon my parents, his all noble. My master, my dear lord he is; and I His servant live, and will his vassal die: He must not be my brother.â Count. Nor I your mother? Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law; Heav'n shield, you mean it not! daughter and mother So strive upon your pulse: What pale again? My fear hath catch'd your fondness.âNow I see The mystery of your loneliness, and find Your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross, You love my son. If it be so, you have wound a goodly clue: If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee, As heaven shall work in me for thine avail, To tell me truly. Hel. Good madam, pardon me! Count. Do you love my son? Hel. Do not you love him, Madam? Count. Go not about; come, come, disclose The state of your affection; for your passions Have to the full appeach'd. Hel. Then I confess, Here on my knee, before high heaven and you, That before you, and next unto high heaven, I love your son:â My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love: Be not offended; for it hurts not him, That he is lov'd of me: I follow him not By any token of presumptuous suit; Nor would I have him, 'till I do deserve him; Yet never know, how that desert should be. I know I love in vain. My dearest madam, Let not your hate encounter with my love, For loving where you do: but if yourself Did ever, in so true a flame of liking, Wish chastly, and love dearly, pity shew To her, whose state is such, that cannot choose But lend, and give, where she is sure to lose; That seeks not to find that her search implies; But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies. Count. Had you not lately an intent, speak truly, To go to Paris? Hel. Madam, I had. Count. Wherefore? tell true. Hel. I will tell truth, by grace itself, I swear. You know my father left me some prescriptions Of rare, and prov'd effects; such as his reading And manifest experience had collected For general sovereignty. Amongst the rest, There is a remedy, approv'd, set down, To cure the desperate languishings, whereof The king is render'd lost. Count. This was your motive For Paris, was it? speak. Hel. My lord, your son made me to think of this; Else Paris, and the medicine, and the king, Had from the conversation of my thoughts, Haply, been absent then. Count. But think you, Helen, If you should tender your supposed aid, He would receive it? He and his physicians Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him, They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools, Embowel'd of their doctrine, have left off The danger to itself? Hel. There's something hints More than my father's skill (which was the greatest Of his profession,) that his good receipt Shall, for my legacy be sanctified By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour But give me leave to try success, I'd venture The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure, By such a day, and hour. Count. Dost thou believe't? Hel. Ay madam, knowingly. Count. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love, Means and attendants; and my loving greetings To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home, And pray Heaven's blessing into thy attempt: Begone, my child; and be thou sure of this, What I can help thee to, thou shalt not miss. [Exit. Hel. Our remedies are oft within ourselves, Which we ascribe to Heav'n. Who ever strove To shew her merit, that did miss her love? The king's diseaseâmy project may deceive me, But my intents are fix'd, and will not leave me. [Exit. End of Act I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Court of France. Flourish Cornets. The King of France, with Letters, Bertram, Lafeu, Dumain, Lewis, Parolles, and Lords, discovered. King. Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face. Frank nature, rather curious than in haste, Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts May'st thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris. Ber. My thanks and duty are your majesty's. King. Our letters here, my lords, deliver us, The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears; Have fought with equal fortune, and continue A braving war. Laf. So 'tis reported, sir. King. Nay, 'tis most credible; we here receive it, A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria; With caution that the Florentine will move us For speedy aid. Laf. His love, and wisdom, Approv'd so to your majesty, may plead For ample credence. King. He hath arm'd our answer; And Florence is deny'd, before he comes: Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see The Tuscan service, freely have they leave To stand on either part, except alone The Count Rousillon, whom we keep with us, Lest battle rob his mother of a son, And our sick hours of comfort in his absence. Dum. 'Tis our hope, sir, After well-enter'd soldiers, to return, And find your Grace in health. King. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart Will not confess it owns the malady That doth my life besiege.âFarewell, young lords. Whether I live or die, be you the sons Of worthy Frenchmen. How long is't, my lord, Since the physician at your father's died? He was much fam'd. Ber. Some six months since, my lord. King. If he were living, I would try him yet;â Lend me an arm;âthe rest have worn me out With several applications: nature and sickness Debate it at their leisure.âWelcome, count, My son's no dearer. Ber. Thank your majesty. [Flourish. [Exeunt King and Lafeu. Dum. Oh, sweet, my lord, that you will stay behind us!â Par. 'Tis not his fault; the sparkâ Lewis. Oh, 'tis brave wars! Par. Most admirable: I have seen those wars. Ber. I am commanded here, and kept at home. Par. An' thy mind stand to it, boy, steal away bravely. Ber. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock, Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry, 'Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn But one to dance with!âby heaven, I'll steal away. Dum. There's honour in the theft. Par. Commit it, count. Lewis. I am your accessary. Ber. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body. [Exit Bertram. Dum. Farewell, captain. Lewis. Sweet monsieur Parolles:â Par. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals. You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii, one captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister cheek: it was this very sword entrench'd it: say to him, I live, and observe his reports of me. Lewis. We shall, noble captain. Par. Worthy fellows, and like to prove most sinewy sword-men. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Countess's House. Enter Countess and Clown. Count. Come on, sir, I shall now put you to the height of your breeding. Clo. I will shew myself highly fed, and lowly taught: I know my business is but to the court. Court. But to the court! why, what place make you special, when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court! Clo. Truly, madam, if Heav'n have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and, indeed, such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court: but for me, I have an answer will serve all men. Count. Marry, that's a bountiful answer, that fits all questions. Clo. It is like a barber's chair, that fits all bottoms. Count. Will your answer serve fit to all questions? Clo. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for your taffaty punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's fore-finger, as a pan-cake for Shrove-Tuesday, a morris for May-day, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's mouth: nay, as the pudding to his skin. Count. Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions? Clo. From below your duke, to beneath your constable, it will fit any question. Count. It must be an answer of most monstrous size, that must fit all demands. Clo. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me, if I am courtier;âit shall do you no harm to learn. Count. To be young again, if we could. I will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier? Clo. O Lord, sirâThere's a simple putting off:â more, more, a hundred of them. Count. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours that loves you. Clo. O Lord, sirâThick, thick, spare not me. Count. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat. Clo. O Lord, sirâNay, put me to't, I warrant you. Count. You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think. Clo. O Lord, sirâSpare not me. Count. Do you cry, O Lord, sir, as you are whipping, and spare not me? indeed, your O Lord, sir, is very sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to't. Clo. I ne'er had worse luck in my life, in myâO Lord, sir; I see things may serve long, but not serve ever. Count. I play the noble housewife with the time, to entertain it so merrily with a fool. Clo. O Lord, sirâwhy, there't serves well again. Count. An end, sir; to your business: Give Helen this, And urge her to a present answer back: Commend me to my kinsmen, and my son: This is not much. Clo. Not much commendation to them. Count. Not much employment for you: You understand me. Clo. Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs. Count. Haste you again. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The King's Chamber. The King discovered. Enter Lafeu. [Lafeu kneels. Laf. Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings, Will you be cur'd of your infirmity? King. What dost thou mean? Laf. I have seen a mÃ©decin, That's able to breathe life into a stone; Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary With sprightly fire and motion; whose simple touch Is powerful to raise king Pepin, nay, To give great Charlemain a pen in his hand, And write to her a love-line. King. What her is this? Laf. Why, doctor-she: my lord, there's one arriv'd, If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour, If seriously I may convey my thoughts In this my light deliverance, I have spoke With one, that in her sex, her years, profession, Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more Than I dare blame my weakness: Will you see her (For that is her demand), and know her business? That done, laugh well at me. King. Now, good Lafeu, Bring in the admiration. Laf. Nay, I'll fit you. And not be all day neither. [Exit Lafeu. King. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues. Laf. [Returns.] Nay, come your ways. [Bringing in Helena. King. This haste hath wings, indeed. Laf. Nay, come your ways; This is his majesty, say your mind to him: A traitor you do look like; but such traitors His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle, That dare leave two together; fare you well. Exit. King. Now, fair one, does your business follow us? Hel. Ay, my good lord. Gerard de Narbon was My father; in what he did profess, well found. King. I knew him. Hel. The rather will I spare my praise toward him; Knowing him, is enough. On his bed of death Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one, Which, as the dearest issue of his practice, And of his old experience the only darling, He bade me store up, as a triple eye, Safer than mine own two; more dear I have so: And hearing your high majesty is touch'd With that malignant cause, wherein the honour Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power, I come to tender it with all bound humbleness. King. We thank you, maiden; But may not be so credulous of cure, When our most learned doctors leave us; and The congregated college have concluded, That labouring art can never ransom nature From her unaidable estate: I say we must not So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope, To prostitute our past-cure malady To empirics. Hel. What I can do, can do no hurt to try, Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy. Dear sir, to my endeavours give good scope; Of heaven, not me, make an experiment. I am not an impostor; But know, I think, and think I know most surely, My art is not past power, nor you past cure. King. Art thou so confident? Within what space Hop'st thou my cure? Hel. Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring Their fiery torcher his diurnal round; Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass Hath told the thievish minutes how they glide; What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly, Health shall live free, and sickness freely die. King. Upon thy certainty and confidence, What dar'st thou venture? Hel. Tax of impudence, A strumpet's boldness, and my maiden's name Traduc'd by odious ballads; if I fail, With vilest torture let my life be ended King. Methinks, in thee some blessed spirit doth speak, Thy life is dear; for all, that life can rate Worth name of life, in thee hath residence; Thou this to hazard, needs must intimate Skill infinite, or desperate assurance: Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try, But thy own life depends upon my cure. Hel. If I break time, or flinch in true performance Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die; And well deserv'd! But if I help, what do you promise me? King. Make thy demand. Hel. But will you, sir, fulfil it? King. Ay, by my sceptre, and my hopes of heaven. Hel. Then shalt thou give me, by thy kingly honor, What husband in thy pow'r I will command; Exempted be from me the arrogance To choose from forth the royal blood of France; But such a one thy vassal; whom I know Is free for me to ask, and thee to give. King. Here is my hand; observe the premises; Thy will by my performance shall be crown'd: So make the choice of thine own time, for I, Thy resolv'd patient still, on thee depend. More should I question thee, and more I must; From whence thou cam'st, how tended onâBut rest Unquestion'd welcome, and undoubted blest. Give me some help here, ho! [Enter Lafeu.] If thou proceed As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed. [Exeunt. End of Act II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âThe Court of France. Enter Lafeu and Parolles. Laf. They say, miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons, to make modern, and familiar, things supernatural and causeless. Hence it is, that we make trifles of terrors; ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge, when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear. Par. Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder, that hath shot out in our later times. Laf. And so 'tis. To be relinquish'd of the artistsâ Par. So I say; both of Galen and Paracelsus. Laf.

That's it I wou'd have said; the very same. [Flourish. Here comes the king. Enter King, Helen, Bertram, Lords and Attendants. King. Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side; And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive The confirmation of my promis'd gift; Which but attends thy naming. Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing, O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice I have to use: thy frank election make; Thou hast power to chuse, and they none to deny. Hel. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress Fall, when love please! marry, to each but one!â Laf. I'd give bay curtal and his furniture, My mouth no more were broken than these boys, And writ as little beard. King. Peruse them well: Not one of those but had a noble father. Hel. Gentlemen, Heaven hath through me restor'd the king to health. Ber. We understand it, and thank heaven for you. Hel. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest, That, I protest, I simply am a maid.â Please it your majesty, I have done already: The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me, âWe blush that thou should chuse, but be refus'd; âLet the white death sit on thy cheek for ever. âWe'll ne'er come there again.â King. Make choice; Who shuns thy love, shuns all his love in me. Hel. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly; And to imperial Love, that god most mighty, Do my sighs stream. I dare not say, I take you; but I yield Me, and my service, ever whilst I live, Into your guided power. This is my choice. [To Bertram. King. Why then, young Bertram, take her, she's thy wife. Ber. My wife, my liege? I shall beseech your highness, In such a business give me leave to use The help of mine own eyes. King. Know'st thou not, Bertram, What she hath done for me? Ber. Yes, my good lord; But never hope to know why I should marry her. King. Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed. Ber. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down Must answer for your raising? I know her well; She had her breeding at my father's charge: A poor physician's daughter my wife!âDisdain Rather corrupt me ever! King. 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which I can build up. Strange is it, that our bloods, Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together, Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off In differences, so mighty. If she be All that is virtuous, (save what thou dislik'st, A poor physician's daughter), thou dislik'st Of virtue for the name: but do not so; From lowest place when virtuous deeds proceed, The place is dignified by the performer. She is young, wise, fair; what would'st thou more? If thou canst like this wonder as a maid, I can create the rest; virtue, and she, Is her own dower; honour and wealth are our's. Ber. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't. King. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou should'st strive to choose. Hel. That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad: Let the rest go.â King. My honour's at the stake; which, to defend, I must produce my power. Here, take her hand, Proud, scornful youth, unworthy this good gift; Do thine own fortunes that obedient right, Which both thy duty owes, and our power claims; Or I will throw thee from my care for ever, Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer. Ber. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit My fancy to your eyes. When I consider What great creation, and what dole of honour Flies where you bid it; I find that she, which late Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now The praised of the king; who, so ennobled, Is, as 'twere born so. King. Take her by the hand, And tell her, she is thine: to whom I promise, A counterpoise; if not in thy estate, A balance more replete. Ber. I take her hand. King. Good fortune, and the favour of the king Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony Shall be perform'd to-night; the solemn feast Shall more attend upon the coming space, Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her, Thy love's to me religious; else, does err. [Exeunt all but Parolles and Lafeu. Laf. Do you hear, monsieurâa word with you. Par. Your pleasure, sir? Laf. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation. Par. My lord! my master! Laf. Ay; Is it not a language I speak? Par. A most harsh one; and not to be understood without bloody succeeding. My Master? Laf. Are you companion to the count Rousillon? Par. To any count; to all counts; to what is man. Laf. To what is count's man; count's master is of another style. Par. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.â Laf. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring thee. Par. What I dare too well do, I dare not do. Laf. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass; yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care not; yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou art scarce worth. Par. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon theeâ Laf. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial; which ifâLord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare the well; thy casement I need not open, I look through thee. Give me thy hand. Par. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity. Laf. Ay, with all my heart: and thou art worthy of it. Par. I have not, my lord, deserv'd it. Laf. Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not 'bate thee a scruple. Par. Well, I shall be wiser.â Laf. E'en as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o' the contrary. Par. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation. Laf. I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal: for doing, I am past; as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me leave. [Exit. Par. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me: scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord!âWell, I must be patient; there is do fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any convenience, an' he were double and double a lord. I'll have no more pity of his age, than I would have ofâI'll beat him, an' if I could but meet him again. Re-enter Lafeu. Laf. Sirrah, your lord and master's married, there's news for you: you have a new mistress. Par. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongsâorâ Laf. ThouâBy mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat thee: methinks thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee. Par. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord. Laf. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages, than the heraldry of your birth and virtue gives you commission. You are not worth another word, else I'd call you knave. I leave you. [Exit. Enter Bertram. Par. Good, very good; it is so then. Good, very good; let it be conceal'd a while. Ber. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever! Par. What is the matter, sweet-heart? Ber. Altho' before the solemn priest I have sworn, I will not bed her. Par. What? what, sweet-heart? Ber. O my Parolles, they have married me: I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her. Par. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits The tread of a man's foot: to the wars! Ber. There's letters from my mother; what the import is, I know not yet. Par. To the wars, my boy, to the wars! He wears his honour in a box, unseen, That hugs his kicksy-wicksy here at home; Wasting his manly marrow in her arms, Which should sustain the bound and high curvet Of Mars's fiery steed: To other regions! France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades; Therefore, to the war! Ber. It shall be so; I'll send her to my house; Acquaint my mother with my hate to her, And wherefore I am fled; write to the king That which I durst not speak. War is no strife To the dark house, and the detested wife. Par. Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure? Ber. Go with me to my chamber, and advise me. I'll send her straight away: To-morrow I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow. [Exit. Par. Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it.â'Tis hard; A young man, married, is a man that's marr'd. [Exit. SCENE II. An Apartment in the Palace. Enter Helena and Clown. Hel. My Mother greets me kindly: Is she well? Clo. Truly, she's very well, indeed, but for two things. Hel. What two things? Clo. One, that she's not in heaven, whither heaven send her quickly! the other, that she's in earth, from whence heav'n send her quickly! Enter Parolles. Par. Bless you, my fortunate lady! Hel. I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortune. Par. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them still. Madam, my lord will go away to-night: A very serious business calls on him. He leaves you now, by a compell'd restraint: But says your coming hours shall flow with joy, And pleasure drown the brim. Hel. What's his will else? Par. That you will take your instant leave o' the king, And make this haste as your own good proceeding, Strengthen'd with what apology you think May make it probable need. Hel. What more commands he? Par. That having this obtain'd, you presently Attend his further pleasure. Hel. In every thing I wait upon his will. Par. I shall report it so. [Exit Parolles. Hel. I pray you do.âCome with me, sirrah. [To Clown. Clo. No, madam, not with you. Hel. How! Clo. After youâI know my distance. Exeunt. SCENE III. Another Apartment in the Palace. Enter Lafeu and Bertram. Laf. But, I hope, your lordship thinks not him a soldier. Ber. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof. Laf. You have it from his own deliverance. Ber. And by other warranted testimony. Laf. Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting. Ber. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge, and accordingly valiant. Laf. I have then sinned against his experience, and transgress'd against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent: here he comes. Enter Parolles. Ber. Is she gone to the king? [Aside to Parol. Par. She is. Ber. Will she away to-night? Par. As you'll have her. Ber. I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure, And given orders for our horses; Laf. Save you, captain! Ber. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur? Par. I know not how I have deserv'd to run into my lord's displeasure. Laf. You have made shift to run into't, boots and spurs, and all, like him that leapt into the custard: Fare you well, my lord: and believe this of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut: the soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in matter of heavy consequence: Farewell, monsieur, I have spoken better of you, than you have or will deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil. [Exit. Par. An idle lord, I swear.â Ber. I think so. Par. Why, do you not know him? Ber. Yes, I know him well; and common speech Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog. Enter Helena. Hel. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you, Spoke with the king, and have procur'd his leave For present parting; only, he desires Some private speech with you. Ber. I shall obey his will. You must not marvel, Helen, at my course, Which holds not colour with the time, nor does The ministration and required office On my particular. Prepar'd I was not For such a business; therefore am I found So much unsettled: This drives me to entreat you, That presently you take your way for home: 'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so I leave you to your wisdom. Hel. Sir, I can nothing say, But that I am your most obedient servant. Ber. Come, come, no more of that. Hel. And ever shall With true observance seek to eke out That, Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd To equal my great fortune. Ber. Let That go: My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home. Hel. Pray, sir, your pardon. Ber. Well, what would you say? Hel. I am not worthy of the wealth I owe; Nor dare I say 'tis mine; and yet it is; But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal What law does vouch mine own. Ber. What would you have? Hel. Something, and scarce so much:ânothing, indeed.â I would not tell you what I would; my lordâ'faith, yes;â Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss. Ber. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse. Hel. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord. [Exit Helena. Ber. Where are my other men, monsieur?âFarewell. Go thou toward home, where I will never come, Whilst I can shake my sword, or hear the drum:â Away, and for our flight. Par. Bravely, coragio! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Rousillon, in France. Enter Countess and Clown. Count. It hath happened all as I would have had it; save that he comes not along with her. Clo. By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man. Count. By what observance, I pray you? Clo. Why, he will look upon his boot, and sing; ask questions, and sing; pick his teeth, and sing. I knew a man that had this trick of melancholy, sold a good manor for a song. Count. Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come. [Reads the Letter. Clo. I have no mind to Isbel, since I was at court. Our Isbel's o' the country, are nothing like your Isbels o' the court: the brain of my Cupid's knock'd out; and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach. [Exit. Countess reads a Letter. I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the not eternal. You shall hear, I am run away; know it, before the report come. If there be breadth enough in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to you. Your unfortunate son, Bertram. This is not well, rash and unbridled boy, To fly the favours of so good a king; To pluck his indignation on thy head, By the misprizing of a maid, too virtuous For the contempt of empire. Re-enter Clown. Clo. O madam, yonder is heavy news within, between two gentlemen and my young lady. Count. What is the matter? Clo. Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your son will not be kill'd so soon as I thought he would. Count. Why should he be kill'd? Clo. So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does. Here they come, will tell you more. Enter Helena, Biron, and Jaques. Hel. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever goneâ Count. Do not say so. Hel. Look on this letter, madam; here's my passport. When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which never shall come off; and shew me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then call me husband: but in such a Then I write a Never! This is a dreadful sentence. Count. Brought you this letter, gentlemen? Bir. Ay, madam; And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains. Count. I pr'ythee, lady, have a better cheer: If thou engrossest all the griefs as thine, Thou robb'st me of a moiety: He was my son; But I do wash his name out of my blood, And thou art all my child. Where is my son? Bir. Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence: We met him thitherward; from thence we came, And, after some dispatch in hand at court, Thither we bend again. Count. Towards Florence is he? Jaq. Ay, madam. Count. And to be a soldier? Bir. Such is his noble purpose. Hel. 'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France! 'Tis bitter. [Reading. Count. Find you that there? Hel. Ay, madam. Count. Nothing in France, until he have no wife! There's nothing here that is too good for him, But only she; and she deserves a lord, That twenty such rude boys might tend upon, And call her hourly mistress. I will entreat you, when you see my son, To tell him, that his sword can never win The honour that he loses; more I'll intreat you Written to bear along. Bir. We serve you, madam, In that and all your worthiest affairs. Count. Not so, but as we change our courtesies. Will you draw near? [Exeunt Countess and Gentlemen. Hel. 'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France! Nothing in France, until he have no wife! Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France, Then hast thou all again! Poor lord! is't I That chase thee from thy country, and expose thee To the event of the none-sparing war? O you leaden messengers, That ride upon the violent speed of fire, Fly with false aim; and do not touch my lord! Whoever shoots at him, I set him there. Whoever charges on his forward breast, I am the caitiff that do hold him to it; Better 'twere, I met the ravening lion when he roar'd With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere, That all the miseries, which nature owes, Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon; I will be gone: My being here it is that holds thee hence. Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although The air of Paradise did fan the house, And angels offic'd all: I will be gone; That pitiful rumour may report my flight, To consolate thine ear. Come, night! end, day! For, with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away. [Exit. End of Act III.</field>

Might you not know, she would do, as she has done, By sending me a letter? Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much, As letting her pass so; had I spoke with her, I could have well diverted her intents, Which thus she hath prevented. Stew. Pardon me, madam: If I had given you this at over-night She might have been o'er-ta'en; and yet she writes, Pursuit would be but vain. Count. What angel shall Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive, Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear, And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo, To this unworthy husband of his wife; Let every word weigh heavy of her worth, That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief, Tho' little he do feel it, set down sharply. Dispatch the most convenient messenger:â When, haply, he shall hear that she is gone, He will return; and hope he may, that she, Hearing so much, will speed her foot again, Led hither by pure love. Which of them both Is dearest to me, I have no skill in sense To make distinction: Provide this messenger:â My heart is heavy, Grief would have tears, sorrow bids me speak. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Without the Walls of Florence. A Tucket afar off. Enter an old Widow of Florence, and Diana, with other Citizens. Wid. Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we shall lose all the sight. Dia. They say the French count has done most honourable service. Wid. It is reported that he has ta'en their greatest commander; and that with his own hand he flew the duke's brother. We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way: hark! you may know by their trumpets. Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and no legacy is so rich as honesty. Dia. You shall not need to fear me. Enter Helena, disguised like a Pilgrim. Wid. I hope soâLook, here comes a pilgrim; I know she will lie at my house: thither they send one another. I'll question her: Heaven save you, pilgrim! Whither are you bound? Hel. To St. Jacques le Grand. Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you? Wid. At the St. Francis here, beside the port. Hel. Is this the way? [A March afar off. Wid. Ay, marry is it. Hark you? They come this way:âIf you will tarry, holy pilgrim, But 'till the troops come by, I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd; You came, I think from France? Hel. I did so. Wid. Here you shall see a countryman of your's, That has done worthy service. Hel. His name, I pray you? Dia. The count Rousillon: Know you such a one? Hel. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him. His face I know not. Dia. Whatsoe'er he is, He's bravely taken here. He stole from France, As 'tis reported; for the king had married him Against his liking. Think you it is so? Hel. Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady. Dia. There is a gentleman that serves the count, Reports but coarsely of her. Hel. What's his name? Dia. Monsieur Parolles. Hel. Oh, I believe with him, In argument of praise, or to the worth Of the great count himself, she is too mean To have her name repeated; all her deserving Is a reserved honesty, and that I have not heard examin'd. Dia. Alas, poor lady! 'Tis a hard bondage, to become the wife Of a detesting lord. Wid. Ay! right: good creature! wheresoe'er she is Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her A shrewd turn if she pleas'd. Hel. How do you mean? May be, the amorous count solicits her In the unlawful purpose. Wid. He does indeed; And brokes with all, that can in such a suit Corrupt the tender honour of a maid: But she is arm'd for him, and keeps her guard In honestest defence. Enter with Drum and Colours, Bertram, Parolles, Dumain, Lewis, Biron, Jaques, Officers and Soldiers attending. Bert. Let the troops march roundâwe'll take a nearer course. Wid. So, now they come:â That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son; That, Escalus. Hel. Which is the Frenchman? Dia. He; That with the plume: 'Tis a most gallant fellow; I would he lov'd his wife: if he were honester, He were much goodlier.âIs't not a handsome gentleman? Hel. I like him well. Dia. 'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave, That leads him to these places; were I his lady, I'd poison that vile rascal. Why is he melancholy? Hel. Perchance he's hurt i' the battle. Par. Lose our drum! well.â Dia. He's shrewdly vex'd at something. Look, he has spied us. Wid. Marry, hang you! [Exeunt Bertram, and Parolles, &amp;c. Wid. The troop is past: Come, pilgrim, I will bring you, Where you shall host: Of enjoin'd penitents There's four or five, to great St. Jaques bound, Already at my house. Hel. I humbly thank you: Please it this matron, and this gentle maid To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking Shall be for me; and to requite you further, I will bestow some precepts on this virgin Worthy the note. Dia. We'll take your offer kindly. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Florence. Enter Bertram, Dumain, and Lewis. Dum. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman; he's a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment. Ber. I would I knew in what particular action to try him. Lew. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do. Dum. I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprize him; we will bind and hood-wink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our tents: Be but your lordship present at his examination; if he do not, for the promise of his life, and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you, and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon earth, never trust my judgment in any thing. Enter Parolles. Lew. Here he comesâO, for the love of laughter, hinder not the humour of his design; let him fetch off his drum in any hand. Par. Lose our drum! our drum! Ber. How now, monsieur? this drum sticks sorely in your disposition. Lew. A plague on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum. Par. But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There was an excellent command! to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers. Ber. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to be recover'd. Par. It might have been recover'd. Ber. It might; but it is not now. Par. It is to be recover'd; but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum, or another, or hic jacetâ Ber. Why, if you have a stomach to't, monsieur, if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into its native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprize, and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it, and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness. Par. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it. Ber. But you must not now slumber in it. Par. I'll about it this evening: and I will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and, by midnight, look to hear further from me. Ber. May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are about it? Par. I know not what the success will be, my lord; but the attempt I vow. Ber. I know thou art valiant; and, to the possibility of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee. Farewell. Par. I love not many words. [Exit. Dum. No more than a fish loves water.âIs not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do, and dares better be damn'd than do't? Ber. Why do you think he will make no deed at all of this, that so seriously he does address himself unto? Dum. None in the world. We'll make you some sport with the fox, ere we case him. He was first smoak'd by the old lord Lafeu: when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; I must go and look my twigs; he shall be caught, this very night. [Exit. Ber. Now will I lead you to the house, and shew you The lass I spoke of. Lew. But you say she's honest. Ber. That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once, And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her, By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind, Tokens and letters, which she did re-send; And this is all I have done: She's a fair creature; Will you go see her? Lew. With all my heart, my lord. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Florence. The Widow's House. Enter Helena and Widow. Hel. If you misdoubt me that I am not she, I know not how I shall assure you further; But I shall lose the grounds I work upon. Wid. Tho' my estate be fallen, I was well born, Nothing acquainted with these businesses; And would not put my reputation now In any staining act. Hel. Nor would I wish you. First, give me trust, the count he is my husband; And, what to your sworn council I have spoken, Is so, from word to word; and then you cannot, By the good aid that I of you shall borrow, Err in bestowing it. Wid. I should believe you; For you have shew'd me that, which well approves You are great in fortune. Hel. Take this purse of gold, And let me buy your friendly help thus far, Which I will overpay, and pay again When I have found it. The gentle count he woos your daughter, Resolves to carry her; let her, in fine, consent, As we'll direct her, how 'tis best to bear it. Now his important blood will nought deny, That she'll demand: A ring the county wears That downward hath succeeded in his house From son to son, some four or five descents, Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire, To buy his will it would not seem too dear, Howe'er repented after. Wid. Now I see the bottom of your purpose. Hel. You see it lawful then. It is no more, But that your daughter, ere she seems as won, Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter; In fine, delivers me to fill the time, Herself most chastely absent; after this, To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns To what is past already. Wid. I have yielded: Instruct my daughter how she shall persevere, That time and place, with this deceit so lawful, May prove coherent. Every night he comes With music of all sorts, and songs compos'd To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us To chide him from our eaves; for he persists, As if his life lay on't. Hel. Why then, to-night Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed, Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed; And lawful meaning in a lawful act; Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact. But let's about it.â [Exeunt. SCENE V. Part of the French Camp in Florence. Enter Dumain and Interpreter, with five or six Soldiers in Ambush. Dumain. He can come no other way but by this hedge corner: When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will; tho' you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him, unless some one amongst us, whom we must produce for an interpreter. Int. Good captain, let me be the interpreter. Dum. Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice? Int. No, sir, I warrant you. Dum. But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again? Int. Even such as you speak to me. Dum. He must think us some band of strangers i' the adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another; only seem to know; gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes; to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges. Enter Parolles. Par. Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoak me; and disgraces have of late knock'd too often at my door. I find my tongue is too fool-hardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it, and of his crearures, not daring the reports of my tongue. Dum. This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of. [Aside. Par. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum; being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it. They will say, came you off with so little? and great ones I dare not give: Wherefore? what's the instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman's mouth, and buy another of Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils. Dum. Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is? Par. I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword. Dum. 'Twould not do. [Aside. Par. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stript. Dum. Hardly serve. [Aside. Par. Tho' I swore I leap'd from the window of the citadelâ Dum. How deep? [Aside. Par. Thirty fathom. Dum. Three great oaths would scarce make that be believ'd. [Aside. Par. I would I had any drum of the enemy's; I would swear, I recover'd it. Dum. You shall hear one anon. [Aside. Par. A drum now of the enemys! [Alarum within. Dum. Throcamovousus, cargo, cargo, cargo. All. Crago, crago, villianda par corbo, cargo. Par. Oh! ransom, ransom: do not hide mine eyes. [They seize him and blind-fold him. Inter. Muskos thromuldo muskos. Par. I know you are the Musko's regiment, And I shall lose my life for want of language. If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch, Italian, or French let him speak to me, I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine. Inter. Boskos vauvado:â I understand thee, and can speak thy tongue:â All. Kerelybonto:â Inter. Betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poignards Are at thy bosom. Par. Oh! Inter. Oh, pray, pray, pray, Mancha revania dulche. Dum. Osceoribi dulchos volivorco. Inter. The general is content to spare thee yet; And, hood-winkt as thou art, will lead thee on To gather from thee. Haply, thou may'st inform Something to save thy life. Par. Oh let me live, And all the secrets of our camp I'll shew, Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that Which you will wonder at. Inter. But wilt thou faithfully? Par. If I do not, damn me. Inter. Acordo linta. Come on, thou art granted space. [Exit with Par. [A short alarum within. Dum. Go, tell the count Rousillon and my brother We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled 'Till we do hear from them. Sol. Captain, I will. Dum. He will betray us all unto ourselves, Inform 'em that. Sol. So I will, Sir. Dum. 'Till then I'll keep him dark, and safely lock'd. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. The Widow's House. Enter Bertram and Diana. Ber. They told me that your name was Fontibell. Dia. No, my good lord, Diana. Ber. Titled goddess, And worth it with addition! But, fair soul, In your fine frame hath love no quality? If the quick fire of youth light not your mind, You are no maiden, but a monument: When you are dead, you should be such a one As you are now, for you are cold and stern; And now you should be as your mother was, When your sweet self was got. Dia. She then was honest. Ber. So should you be. Dia. No. My mother did but duty; such, my lord, As you owe to your wife. Ber. No more of that! I pr'ythee, do not strive against my vows: I was compell'd to her; but I love thee By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever Do thee all rights of service. Dia. Ay, so you serve us, 'Till we serve you: but when you have our roses, You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves, And mock us with our barrenness. Ber. How have I sworn? Dia. 'Tis not the many oaths that make the truth, But the plain single vow, that is vow'd true; Therefore your oaths Are words, and poor conditions but unseal'd; At least, in my opinion. Ber. Change it, change it: Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy; And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts That you do charge men with: Say, thou art mine; and ever My love shall persevere, as it begins. Dia. I see, that men make hopes in such affairs That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring. Ber. I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power To give it from me. Dia. Will you not, my lord? Ber. It is an honour 'longing to our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors; Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world In me to lose. Dia. Mine honour's such a ring: My chastity's the jewel of our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors; Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom Brings in the champion honour on my part, Against your vain assault. Ber. Here, take my ring: My house, mine honour, yea, my life be thine, And I'll be bid by thee. Dia. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window; I'll order take, my mother shall not hear. Now will I charge you in the band of truth, Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me: My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them, When back again this ring shall be deliver'd: And on your finger, in the night I'll put Another ring; that, what in time falls out, May token to the future our past deeds. Adieu, 'till then; then, fail not: You have won A wife of me, tho' there my hope be ended. Ber. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee. [Exit. Dia. For which live long to thank both heaven and me! You may so in the end.â My mother told me just how he would woo, As if she sat in his heart; she says, all men Have the like oaths: Marry, that will, I'll live and die a maid: Only, in this disguise, I think't no sin To cozen him, that would unjustly win. [Exit. SCENE VII. The Florentine Camp. Enter Dumain, and Lewis. Dum. You have not given him his mother's letter? Lew. I have deliver'd it, and there is something in't that stings his nature; for, on the reading it, he chang'd almost into another man. Dum. He has much worthy blame laid upon him, for shaking off so good a wife, and so sweet a lady. Lew. Especially, he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you. Dum. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave of it. Lew. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he triumphs in the spoil of her honour: he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition. Dum. We shall not then have his company to-night? Lew. Yes, yes, till midnight. Dum. That approaches apace. Lew. In the mean time, what hear you of these wars? Dum. I hear there is a peace concluded. Lew. What will count Rousillon do then? will he travel higher, or return again into France? Dum. I perceive by this demand, you are not altogether of his counsel. Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house; her pretence is a pilgrimage to St. Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking, with most austere sanctimony, she accomplish'd: and there residing, the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven. Lew. How is this justified? Dum. The stronger part of it by her own letters; which makes her story true, even to the point of her death: her death itself (which could not be her office to say, is come) was faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place. Lew. Hath the count all this intelligence? Dum. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity: Here comes his Lordship. Enter Bertram, Biron, and Jaques. Sweet Lord, prepare; the Braggart is detected: he hath prov'd himself what he is, and lies here in our hands. Ber. I have to-night dispatch'd sixteen businesses, a month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success: I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest; writ to my lady mother I am returning; buried my wife; mourn'd for her. But shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module; he has deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier. How does he carry himself? Dum. He hath confess'd himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant and what think you he hath confest? Ber. Nothing of me, has he? Lew. His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face; if your lordship be in't, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it. Re-enter Interpreter, and Soldiers with Parolles. Ber. A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me; hush! hush! Dum. Hoodman comes: Partotartarossa. Inter. He calls for the tortures: What will you say without 'em? Par. I will confess what I know without constraint; if ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more. Inter. Bosko Chimurcho. Lew. Boblibindo chicurmurco. Inter. You are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note. Par. And truly, as I hope to live. Inter. How many horse is the duke strong. What say you to that? Par. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all scatter'd, and the commanders very poor rogues; upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live. Ber. What a slave is this! Inter. Well, that's set down. Par. Five or six thousand horse I said or thereabouts, set down; for I'll speak truth. Poor rogues, I pray you, say. Inter. Well, that's set down. Par. I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the rogues are marvellous poor. Inter. Of what strength are they a-foot? Par. By my troth, sir, I will tell true. Let me see: the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces. Ber. What shall be done to him? Dum. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my conditions, and what credit I have with the duke. Inter. Well, that's set down. Is one captain Dumain i' the camp, a Frenchman: what is his reputation with the duke, what his valour, honesty, and expertness in war: or is it not possible with well-weighing sums of gold to corrupt him to a revolt? What say you to this? Par. I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the interrogatories. Demand them singly. Inter. Do you know this captain Dumain? Par. I know him: he was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipp'd for getting the sheriff's fool with child; a dumb innocent, that could not say him, nay. [Dumain lifts up his Hand in Anger. Ber. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; we'll have it out. Inter. Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp? Par. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy. Dum. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon. Inter. What is his reputation with the duke? Par. The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine; and writ to me the other day to turn him out o' the band. I think I have his letter in my pocket. Inter. Marry, we'll search. Par. In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there, or it is upon the file, with the duke's other letters, in my tent. Inter. Here 'tis; here's a paper, shall I read it to you? Par. I do not know if it be it, or no. Ber. Our interpreter does it well. Dum. Excellently. Inter. Diana, The count's a fool and full of gold. Par. That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one count Rousillon, a foolish idle fellow, but, for all that, very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again. Inter. Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour. Par. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid: for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious youth, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds. Ber. Damnable! both sides rogue. Interpreter reads the Letter. When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it. After he scores, he never pays the score: Half won, is match well made; match, and well make it: He ne'er pays after-debts; take it before; And say, a soldier (Dian.) told thee this: Men are to mell with, boys are but to kiss. For, count of this, the count's a fool, I know it; Who pays before, but not when he does owe it. Thine, as he vow'd to thee in thine ear, Parolles. Ber. He shall be whipp'd thro' the army. Lew. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist, and the armi-potent soldier. Inter. I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be fain to hang you. Par. My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to die; but that my offences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, any where, so I may live. Inter. We'll say what may be done, so you confess freely; therefore, once more, to this captain Dumain: you have answer'd to his reputation with the duke, and to his valour: What is he honestly? Par. He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes no keeping of oaths; in breaking them he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such volubility, that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his best virtue; for he will be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they know his conditions, and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has every thing that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing. Inter. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you, if gold will corrupt him to revolt? Par. Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the intail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually. Inter. What is his brother, the other captain Dumain? Lew. Don't ask him of me. Ber. By your leave but he shall. Inter. What's he? Par. E'en a crow of the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness; but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreat, he outruns any lacquey; marry, in coming-on he has the cramp. Inter. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine? Par. Ay, and the captain of his horse, count Rousillon: He's a great coward too. Inter. I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure. Par. I'll no more drumming, a plague of all drums! Yet, who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken. [Aside. Inter. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the general says, you, that have so traiterously discovered the secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no very honest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head. Par. O Lord, sir; let me live, or let me see my death. Inter. That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends. [Unbinding him. So, look about you; know you any here? Ber. Good-morrow, noble captain. Lew. Heaven bless you, captain Parolles. Dum. Heaven save you, noble captain. Lew. Captain, what greeting will you to my lord Lafeu? I am for France. Ber. Good captain, will you give me a copy of that same sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the count Rousillon? if I were not a very coward, I'd compel it of you; but fare you well. [Exeunt. Inter. You are undone, Captain, all but your scarf; that has a knot on't yet. Par. Who cannot be crush'd with a plot? Inter. Fare you well, sir; I am for France too; we shall speak of you there. [Exit. Par. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great, 'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more; But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft, As captain shall: simply the thing I am Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart, Let him fear this; for it will come to pass, That every braggart shall be found an ass. Rust, sword! cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive! There's place and means for every man alive. [Exit. End of Act IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Rousillon. Enter Countess, Lafeu, and Clown. Laf. No, no, no, your son was mis-led with a snipt-taffata fellow there. Count. I would I had not known him! it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating: if she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted love. Laf. 'Twas a good Lady, 'twas a good Lady. We may pick a thousand sallets, ere we light on such another herb. Clo. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the sallet, or rather the herb of grace. Laf. They are not sallet-herbs, you knave, they are nose herbs. Clo. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, Sir, I have not much skill in grass. Laf. Go thy ways, Go thy ways; let my horses be well look'd to, without any tricks. Clo. If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature. [Exit. Laf. A shrewd knave, I was about to tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death, and that my lord your son was upon his return home, I mov'd the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did first propose: his highness has promis'd me to do it; and to stop up the displeasure he hath conceiv'd against your son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it? Count. With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily effected. Laf. His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able a body as when he number'd thirty; he will be here within this hour, or I am deceiv'd. Count. It rejoices me, that, I hope I shall see him ere I die. I have letters that my son will be here to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain with me 'till they meet together. Enter Clown. Clo. O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't, or no, the velvet knows: but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare. Count. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery of honour. So, belike, is that. Clo. But it is your carbonado'd face. Laf. Let us see your son, I pray you: I long to talk with the young noble soldier. Clo. 'Faith, there's a dozen of 'em with delicate fine hats, and most courteous feathers, which bow the head, and nod at every man, and belike not a feather head of them wiser than my own. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Coast of France, near Marseilles. Enter Helena, Widow, and Diana, Hel. Welcome to France.â That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you, One of the greatest in the Christian world, Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful, Ere I can perfect my intents, to kneel, And answer thanks. I duly am inform'd His Grace is at Marseilles, to which place We have convenient convoy; you must know, I am supposed dead; the army breaking, My Husband hies him home; where Heav'n aiding, And by the leave of my good Lord the King, We'll be before our welcome. Wid. Gentle Madam, You never had a Servant, to whose trust Your Business was more welcome. Hel. Nor you, mistress, Ever a friend, whose thoughts more truly labour To recompense your love: doubt not, but heaven Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower, As it hath fated her to be my motive And helper to a husband.âYou, Diana, Under my poor instructions yet must suffer Something in my behalf. Dia. Let death and honesty Go with your impositions, I am your's Upon your will to suffer. Hel. Thanks dear friend! Enter Tourville. This man may help me to his Majesty's ear, If he wou'd spend his power. Heav'n save you, Sir. Tour. And you. Hel. Sir I have seen you in the court of France. Tour. I have been sometimes there. Hel. I do presume, Sir, that you are not fallen From the report that goes upon your goodness; And, therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions Which lay nice manners by, I put you to The use of your own virtues, for the which I shall continue thankful. Tour. What's your will? Hel. That it will please you To give this poor petition to the king; And aid me with that store of power you have, To come into his presence. Tour. The king's not here. Hel. Not here, sir? Gent. Not, indeed. He hence remov'd last night, and with more haste Than is his use. Wid. Lord, how we lose our pains! Hel. All's well that ends well, yet; Tho' time seems so adverse, and means unfit.â I do beseech you, whither is he gone? Tour. Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon, Whither I am going. Hel. I beseech you, sir, Since you are like to see the king before me, Commend this paper to his gracious hand; Which, I presume, shall render you no blame, But rather make you thank your pains for it. I will come after you, with what good speed Our means will make us means. Tour. This I'll do for you. Hel. And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd, Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again, my Friends. Come, come, provide. All's well that ends well: still the fine's the crown; Whate'er the course, the end is the renown. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Rousillon. Enter Clown and Parolles. Par. Good Mr. Lavatch, give my lord Lafeu this letter: I have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's moat, and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure. Clo. Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell so strongly as thou speak's of; I will henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering. Pr'ythee, allow the wind. Par. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I speak but by a metaphor. Clo. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or against any man's metaphor. Pr'ythee, get thee further. Par. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper. Clo. Foh! pr'ythee, stand away; Look, here he comes himself. Enter Lafeu. Here is a pur of fortune's, sir, or fortune's cat (but not a musk-cat), that hath fallen into the unclean fish-pond of her displeasure, and, as he says, is muddled withal. Pray you, sir, use the carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decay'd, ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress in my smiles of comfort, and leave him to your lordship. [Exit Clown. Par. My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratch'd. Laf. And what would you have me to do? 'tis too late to pare her nails now. Par. I beseech your honour to hear me one single word. My name, my good lord, is Parolles. Laf. Cox' my passion! give me your hand:âHow does your drum? Par. O my good lord, you were the first that found me. Laf. Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee. Par. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me out. [Sound Trumpets.] Laf. The king's coming, I know by his trumpets.â Sirrah, enquire further after me; I had talk of you last night; tho' you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat; go to, follow. Par. I praise God for you. [Exeunt. Par. and Laf. Enter King, Countess, Lafeu, Dumain, Lewis, Biron, and Jaques, with Attendants. Flourish. King. My honour'd lady, I have forgiven and forgotten all: Tho' my revenges were high bent upon him, And watch'd the time to shoot. Laf. This I must sayâ But first I beg my pardonâThe young lord Did to his majesty, his mother, and his lady, Offence of mighty note; but to himself The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife, Whose beauty did astonish the survey Of richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive; Whose dear perfection, hearts, that scorn'd to serve, Humbly call'd mistress. King. Praising what is lost, Makes the remembrance dear. Wellâcall him hither; We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill All repetition; Let him not ask our pardon. The nature of his great offence is dead, And deeper than oblivion we do bury The incensing relics of it. Let him approach, A stranger, no offender; and inform him, So 'tis our will he should. Dum. I shall my liege. [Exit Dumain. King. What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke? Laf. All that he is, hath reference to your highness. King. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me, That set him high in fame. Enter Bertram, and Dumain. Laf. He looks well on't. King. I am not a day of season, For thou may'st see a sun-shine and a hail In me at once: But to the brightest beams Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth, The time is fair again. Ber. My high repented blames, Dear sovereign, pardon to me. King. All is whole. You remember The daughter of this lord? Ber. Admiringly, my liege. At first I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue: Thence it came, That she, whom all men prais'd, and whom myself, Since I have lost, have lov'd, was in mine eye The dust that did offend it. King. Well excus'dâ That thou dost love her, strikes some scores away From that great 'compt: Sweet Helen, fare thee wellâShe's gone for ever! 'Tis too late to weepâRevive your smiles In living Maudlin's love. Laf. Come on, my son, in whom my house's name, Must be digested: give a favour from you To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter, That she may quickly come. By my old beard, And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead, Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this, The last that e'er she took her leave at court, I saw upon her finger. Ber. Her's it was not. King. Now, pray you, let me see it: For mine eye, While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't. This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen, I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood Necessity'd to help, that by this token I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her Of what should stead her most? Ber. My gracious sovereign, Howe'er it pleases you to take it so, The ring was never her's. Count. Son, on my life, I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it At her life's rate. Laf. I am sure I saw her wear it. Ber. You are deceiv'd, my lord, she never saw it. In Florence was it from a casement thrown me, Wrap'd in a paper, which contain'd the name Of her that threw it: Noble she was, and thought I stood engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd To mine own fortune, and inform'd her fully, I could not answer in the course of honour As she had made the overture, she ceas'd In heavy satisfaction, and would never Receive the ring again. King. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's, Whoever gave it you: Then, if you know, That you are well acquainted with yourself, Confess 'twas her's, and by what rough enforcement You got it from her. She call'd the saints to surety, That she would never put it from her finger, Unless she gave it to yourself in bed (Where you have never come), or sent it us Upon her great disaster. Ber. She never saw it. King. Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour; And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me, Which I would fain shut out: If it should prove That thou art so inhumanâ'twill not prove so;â And yet I know not:âthou didst hate her deadly, And she is dead; which nothing, but to close Her eyes myself, could win me to believe, More than to see this ring. Take him away, [Guards seize Bertram. We'll sift this matter further. Ber. If you shall prove This ring was ever her's, you shall as easy Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence, Where yet she never was. [Exit Bertram guarded. Enter Tourville, King. I am wrap'd in dismal thinkings. Tour. Gracious sovereign, Whether I have been to blame, or no, I know not: Here's a petition from a Florentine, who, Is here attending: her business looks in her With an importing visage; and she told me, In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern Your highness with herself. The King reads a Letter. Upon his many protestations to marry me, when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the count Rousillon a widower, his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to this country for justice: Grant it me, O king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone. Diana Capulet. Laf. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for him. I'll none of him. King. The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafeu, To bring forth this discovery.âSeek these suitors: [Exit Tourville. Go, speedily, and bring again the count. [Exit Dumain. Enter Bertram, guarded, and Dumain. I am afraid, the life of Helen (lady), Was foully snatch'd. Count. Now, justice on the doers! King. I wonder, sir, since wives are monsters to you; And that you fly them as you swear to them; Yet you desire to marry. What woman's that? Enter Tourville, Widow and Diana. Dia. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine, Derived from the ancient Capulet; My suit, as I do understand, you know, Some in your Court do know it Royal Sir, And therefore know how far I may be pitied. Wid. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour Both suffer under this complaint we bring, And both shall cease, without your remedy. King. Come hither, count; do you know these women? Ber. My lord, I neither can, nor will, deny But that I know them: Do they charge me further? Dia. Why do you look so strange upon your wife? Ber. She's none of mine, my lord. Dia. If you shall marry, You give away this hand, and that is mine; You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine; You give away myself, which is known mine; For I by vow am so embodied your's, That she, which marries you, must marry me, Either both, or none. Ber. My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature, Whom sometimes I have laugh'd with: let you highness, Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour, Than for to think that I would sink it here. King. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend, 'Till your deeds gain them: Fairer prove your honour, Than in my thought it lies! What say'st thou to her? Ber. She's impudent, my lord; And was a common gamester to the camp. Dia. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so, He might have bought me at a common price. Do not believe him. O, behold this ring, Whose high respect and rich validity Did lack a parallel: yet for all that, He gave it to a commoner o' the camp, If I be one. Count. He blushes, and 'tis it: Of six preceding ancestors, that gem, Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue, Hath it been ow'd and worn. This is his wifeâ That ring's a thousand proofs. King. Methought you said You saw one here in court could witness it. Dia. I did, my lord, but loth am to produce So bad an instrument; his name's Parolles. Laf. I saw the man to-day, if man he be. King. Find him, and bring him hither. [Exit Lafeu. Ber. What of him? He's quoted for a most perfidious slave, With all the spots o'the world tax'd and debosh'd, Which nature sickens with: but to speak truthâ Am I or that, or this, for what he'll utter, That will speak any thing? King. She hath that ring of your's. Ber. I think she has: certain it is, I lik'd her, And courted her i' the wanton way of youth: She knew her distance, and did angle for me, Madding my eagerness with her restraint; As all impediments in fancy's course Are motives of more fancy: and in fine, Subdu'd me to her rate: she got the ring; And I had that, which any inferior might At market-price have bought. Dia. I must be patient: You, that turn'd off a first so noble wife, May justly diet me. I pray you yet (Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband), Send for your ring, I will return it home, And give me mine again. Ber. I have it not. King. What ring was your's, I pray you? Dia. Sir, much like The same upon your finger. King. Know you this ring? this ring was his of late. Dia. And this was it I gave him, being a-bed. King. The story then goes false, you threw it him Out of a casement. Dia. I have spoke the truth. Enter Lafeu, and Parolles. Ber. My lord, I do confess the ring was her's. King. You boggle shrewdly, every feather starts you.â Is this the man you speak of? Dia. It is, my lord. King. Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you, Not fearing the displeasure of your master (Which, on your just proceeding, I'll keep off) By him, and by this woman here, what know you? Par. So please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman. Tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have. King. Come, come, to the purpose: Did he love this woman? Par. Faith, sir, he did love her: but how? King. How, I pray you? Par. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman. King. How is that? Par. He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not. King. As thou art a knave, and no knave: What an equivocal companion is this? Par. I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command. Laf. He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator. Dia. Do you know he promis'd me marriage? Par. 'Faith, I know more than I'll speak. King. But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st? Par. Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them, as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for, indeed, he was mad for her, and talk'd of Satan, and of limbo, and of furies, and I know not what; yet I was in that credit with them at that time, that I knew of their going to bed: and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things that would derive me ill-will to speak of: therefore I will not speak what I know. King. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married: But thou art too little in thy evidence; therefore, stand aside. This ring, you say, was your's? Dia. Ay, my good lord. King. Where did you buy it? or who gave it you? Dia. It was not given me, nor did I buy it. King. Who lent it you? Dia. It was not lent me neither. King. Where did you find it then? Dia. I found it not. King. If it were your's by none of all these ways, How could you give it him? Dia. I never gave it him. Laf. This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure. King. The ring was mine, I gave it his first wife. Dia. It might be your's, or her's, for aught I know. King. Take her away, I do not like her now; To prison with her: and away with him.â Unless thou tell'st me, where thou hadst this ring, Thou diest within this hour. Dia. I'll never tell you. King. Take her away. Dia. I'll put in bail, my liege. King. I think thee now some common customer. Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while? Dia. Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty; He knows, I am no maid, and he'll swear to't: I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not. Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life; I am either maid, or else this old man's wife. [Pointing to Lafeu. King. She does abuse our ears; to prison with her. Dia. Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir, [Exit Widow. The jeweller, that owes the ring, is sent for, And he shall surety me. But for this lord, [To Bert. Who hath bus'd me, as he knows himself, Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him. He knows himself my virgin bed he hath possess'd, And at that time his wife became with child: One, that's dead, is quick. There is my Riddle. Here behold the meaning. Enter Helena and Widow. King. Is there no exorcist Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes? Is't real, that I see? Hel. No, my good lord; 'Tis but a shadow of a wife you see, The name, and not the thing. Ber. Both, both! oh, pardon! Hel. Oh, my good lord, there is your ring again, And look you, here's your letter: This it says, When from my finger you can get this ring, This is done. Will you be mine, now you are fairly won? Ber. If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly. Hel. If it appear not plain, and prove untrue, Deadly divorce step between me and you! O my dear mother, do I see you living? [To the Countess. Laf. Mine eyes smell onions, I shall weep anon:â Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkerchief, [To Par. So, I thank thee, wait on me home. I'll make sport with thee; Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones. King. Let us from point to point this story know, If thou be'st yet free to thine own election, [To Diana. Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower; I thank thee well, that, by thy honest aid, Thou kept'st a wife herself, thyself a maid. Of that, and all the progress more and less, Resolvedly more leisure shall express: All yet seems well; and if it end so meet, The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet. Helen. Helen's a beggar, now the play is done: All is well ended, if this suit is won, That you express content, which we will pay, With strife to please you, day exceeding day; Our's be your patience then, and your's our parts; Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts. [Exeunt. THE END.</field>
