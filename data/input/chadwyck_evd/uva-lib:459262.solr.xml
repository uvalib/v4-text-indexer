Why is there no curtery now I am come I trowe that all the people be dume Or els so god helpe me and halydum They were almost a sleepe. No wordes I harde, nor yet no talking No instrument went nor ballattes synging What ayles you all thus to syt dreaming Of whom take ye care? Of my coming ye may be glad Therefore I pray you be not sad For all your desyre shall be had I can amende your cheare By God I thinke ye haue forgotten me I am welth of this realme looke vpon me For I am to euery man louing and freendly For welth hath no pere. Helth. Brother welth haue ye not yet doone? ye prayse your selfe aboue the moone Euery man may perceyue therby soone That you lacke discresyon Welth. Wherfore, by god I cannot say to much I am so welthy of substaunce and rych In all the worlde where is one such As I am of comparison. Helth. Welth is good I cannot denay Yet prayse your selfe so muche ye may For welth oftentimes doth decay And welth is nothing sure. Welth. Welth hath ben euer in this countrey And here I purpose styll for to be For this is the lande most mete for me And here I wyll endure. Health Therin ye speake full louingle For in this realme welth should be yeth no displeasure I pray you hartely But in the way of communicacion. And for pastyme I would speake some wayes Of no comparison, nor to you no dyspayre, I doo not intende that maner alwayes, But for a recreation, Wealth Brother what soeuer ye say to me. I wyll heare you paciently I am content and I thanke you hartely Begyn and say your pleasure Health I thanke you hartely then wyll I Some what vnto my purpose apply Though welth be praised marualusly yet to myne vnderstanding. Welth is mutable, and that in shame And welth is hauty and proude of name Welth is cruell, and in great blame For welth is euer wauerynge. wealth. To whom haue I doone any harme can ye say, ye slander me nowe, yet I trust I may Aunswere for my selfe in euery maner way ye wyl not deny that? Health God forbyd but ye should do so And ye may doo it whether I wyl or no In lykewise, I must answer you also When ye say not true. Though I be but to you a poore man yet helth I height, the same I am That is desyred vniuersally than Some calles me as good as you Welth. As I, mary ther indeede ye do compare. Such wordes myght brynge you soone in care Lewde parson, thou art not ware Of what substaunce I am Health. Yes I can tell what you are, be not dyspleased welth is of great substaunce, that cannot be denyed yet shew your comodities, and ye shalbe answerrd I promyse you welth is fugitiue. wealth What sayst thou'am I a tage tyue I was neuer so taken vp in my lyfe Nor called vnsure, well I wyll make no stryfe yet where as thou dost say, That I should show my commodityes alwayes The best for my selfe wherof I aske prayse yf I shoulde stand her all my lyfe dayes yet I coulde not say. Nor halfe the benefites that commeth of me yt cannot be tolde nor resyted shortly Welth is the floure of althing earthly That you cannot denye. Ferste god saue, our soueraine Ladye the Queene With all the counsel and all that with them bene Am not I welth with them euer at eue Who should be there but I?

O good syr, of whom commeth all this Of god only, to you no thanke I wys And yet mans welth stands not all in ryches I dare saye that boldly, Whan a man hath a cempetent liuing with the grace of god that passeth all thyng Loue of his neyghbour, and good reporting Then is he welthy, Welth of goodes is but a fame Ye is welthy that hath a good name Euery wyse man wyll coueyte the same For other welth I not reche yf a man haue neuer so much good name Euery wise man wyll coueyte the same if his disposicions be nought and wood Then he is but a wretch, Welth. Nay thou art a wretch, and a foole vnwyse welth of ryches thus to despyse Doest thou not se all the worlde aryse By goodes and substaunce He that hath plenty of syluer and golde May haue all thyng whatsoeuer he woulde whan can welth lacke, seing all thing is solde And welth is of assuraunce. Health I denye that, your saying is nought Grace, heauen, nor cunning, cannot be bought without great paine, ?d good dedes wrought Els man cannot them haue. wealth Stop thereat, and hold thy peace May not men by heauen with richesse As to bylde churches and make bye wayes Such deedes mans soule doth saue Health Yea, but yet ye must marke one thynge yf these goodes came with wronge doyng Shall ye haue heauen for so spendynge Or yet any mede.

With his neighboures he wyll go to lawe And a wreke his malyce for valew of strawe welth is fykle and out uf awe wylfull in wronge or ryght Welth. Thou speakest with a slaunderous tonge All of euyll wyll, and yet it is wronge welth in this realme hath bin longe Of me commeth great honour. Because that I welth hath great porte All the worlde, hyther doth resorte Therfore I welth, am this realmes comfort, And here I wyll indure. Helth. So I wold ye should, and I shall do the same Helth I am called, and that is my name If I would not abyde heare I were to blame For here I am well cherished Yet say your selfe, nhw indifferently And if euery man doo not loue me Helth as well as welth, yes verely Therof I dare be reported Welth. Why should they loue thee? that woulde I knowe As wel as me, I pray you showe I am the superiour of hie and lowe No man may compare with me. Helth. To shew why I wyll not be afraied For I can bide by that I haue sayde Yf welthy men be very well apayd Or muche they set you by. But of welth, if they haue neuer so much Goodes, tryasure and golde, and be called rych Yet yf they lacke helth, there payne is suche That they were better dye. A man to were golde, and be in payne What ioy hath he? none, but would be fayne To giue all his treasure for helth playne Or els he were very mad: For if a man be neuer so poure Yet if he haue helth, that is a treasure, Then for his liuing, he may laboure And in his harte be glad, Welth. I neuer marked thus muche, nor vnderstood That Helth was such a treasure, and to man so good Wherfore I am sory, and I wil chaunge my moode Now I pray you forgiue me. Health I will forgiue or els I were to blame And I pray you to forgiue me the same I loue you hartly, and wyll prayse your name yf it please you to keepe my company.
