      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —The Mountains. Enter Hertman, 2 E. L. H. Hert. Hillio! hillio! Albert, hillio! Enter Albert, 2 E. L. H. Alb. Tush, man! I am not deaf, that you should shout So lustily as though you wished to bring An avalanche upon our witless heads. Did'st ever look upon so fair a scene? [Looking off, L.] Hert. On many, and oft on this. Marry, I love not Your bleak unmannered mountains, Whose boisterous storms shew not more favour To the velvet mantle than the rustic cloth. The sprinkling Old Pontius gave us but just now Hath set me shaking like the Knapstein rock— So let us on, or Stantz will not welcome us To-night. See, the sun is in yon valley. Alb. (Who has been attentively looking at the prospect.) Thirteen broad lakes! By Heaven, I marvel not These Swiss are jealous of their rights and name, Had I been born one, I had been more proud Of these wild hills than all the marble dwellings Kings are housed in. Hert. Methinks, Count Rudolph Would not be over grateful for such thoughts. But, prithee, on; I must to night be found At Stantz. Come, Albert! thour't like a foolish girl That loves whate'er is newest. Alb. I'faith, not I— I love but what is nature. When could man With all his reason's art, so grand a pile Erect or fashion, as her gigantic thought, Hath rais'd in these high hills? Where a carpet spread Of such bright hues, or yielding texture, As her luxuriant fancy Hath wowen for these valleys? Where a dome More lofty or more fair than these tall pine tops? Hert. A truce to sentiment. If thy philosophy Can make these stones good cheer, These streams convert to palatable wine, Then would I tarry, shouldst thou preach till midnight But as I doubt its power, I'd fain be stirring. Alb. Have with thee, then! Thou hast a soul too small To gather pleasure but from sensual things; That which can feed thy body's appetite, And tend to profit, hath all charms for thee. Hertman, thou'lt thrive when I shall be a beggar. Hert. Give me substantial things: they're my philosophy. [Exeunt 1 E. R. H. SCENE II. —A Valley. William, Antoine, Bertha, Gortz, and Peasantry, discovered. [Music. William receives the congratulations of his friends.] Ant. (Comes down R. H.) Thank ye, friends, thank ye. Ber. (Advances.) My sister— For now thou art so—though not more sister Than my love had made thee, when first thy ear Catches' the music of thy hunter's horn, And seems to thee the sweetest melody That ever gladdened it (for it will tell Of safety to thy William), think of her To whom its sound hath lent the chamois speed, That love might satisfy each anxious fear For him whose heart she could but share with thee. [They embrace. Ant. (Observing William.) He looks most nobly. Ber. Yes! my father's eye Is mirror'd in his own. The fire of daring thoughts, Good as they are daring, light it up, that Tamer spirits cannot look upon it. The eagle only gazes on the sun. Ant. Oh, fond idolatress! If thus the good Which bounteous Nature gave thee at his birth Is priz'd beyond all other good thou'st known, How wilt thou worship when thy heart hath found Its imaged self, as I have found in him. Ber. I cannot solve thy riddle, having forsworn Love and its perils. Ant. At what convent's shrine? Thou art no woman if thou canst not love; Thou'lt be inconstant to thy vow, I'd swear it; Thou'lt be in love ere long. Wil. (Advances.) By St. Dominic, Thou sham'st my love, sweet Bertha, by this care. Ber. No wonder, if thou'st felt all wedlock's fears. Wil. How hast thou grown a judge in Hymen's court Who ever laugh'd at love? Thou'lt weep for't yet. Ber. A pair of seers! for Antoine has foretold That I shall be in love. Wil. Then spoke she well; Though not as wife should speak, her husband's thought. Ant. I am so newly wed, I have not learn'd The mute obedience that a husband claims. I cannot lose the wooer—at least not yet. Wil. Nor shall'st thou. Womens' reigns are short As those of tyrants should be. Enter Arnold, U. E. L. H. Arn. Right, boy, right. [To Antoine.] Thou hear'st how William loves a tyrant. The time may come, and that ere one short month, When tyranny will totter on the throne It rais'd on Switzerland's liberties. Couldst thou, in that hour of general sacrifice, Tear thee from his neck, and bid him to the field, Though phalanx'd thousands stood array'd in steel Against our mountain warrior's uncas'd breast— Whose only armour was the holy hope, Of giving freedom to his native land? Ant. I could, and as I arm'd him for the fight, (For he should need no armourer but myself) I'd tell him that his life was Switzerland's: Her gift, and if she claim'd it back, to pay it, Though it would beggar my poor heart for ever. Enter Eberhard, from Cottage, U. E. R. H.—[He salutes the Group.] Arn. My boy! she is worthy of thee and thy love. O liberty! how priceless is thy worth— How vast, how indefinable thy greatness, When love of thee can win young hearts away From e'en their natural idolatries! Eber. Arnold—children, I feel so blest—so gay, That joy asks more than smiles to tell its fullness. My cheeks are wet, but they are gladsome drops That down them stream. Arn. And so we hail them, brother, For though they seem the offspring of some grief, We know them to be gladsome, and do greet them As the dark shadows of the coming storm, When the earth thirsts for moisture, though they mar Awhile the sky's serenity. Omnes. The Lammergeyer! [All the Characters cross to U. E. L. H. William strings his bow and is about to shoot,] Arn. Hold, boy! the bouquetin descries her enemy, Look, friends! how well the little goat defends Her offspring's safety! The lammergeyer Extends his deadly talons idly forth, But dares not strike; the weaker looks the stronger: Round and round he whirls, but still he meets The steady gaze of the poor bouquetin, And quails before it, for it looks resolve; And he that fights alone to gratify His carrion appetite, doth dread the contest, For now he's to the hills again! Men! men! That tamely crouch beneath the Austrian's frown, Do not your pale cheeks burn with honest shame That a poor goat, should from mere instinct, strike For that your reason tells you is most good, But trembling at the danger of a death, Forego the good from terror of the ill. [A shriek is heard without. Voices. (Without.) The vulture hath borne a child into the mountains! Arn. To'ards Mount Pilate his flight appears directed. Be wary of your steps—we cannot spare a man. [Some of the Peasantry rush up the rocks U. E. R. H. 'Tis vain! 'tis vain! he bears him to yon craig! Ah! now he strikes! No! no! he seems to totter on the ledge's brink As though he were the victim. He falls! he falls! And on the slippery path a mountaineer Appears. His garb is not of Switzerland; He must be Austrian—no, no; he has a hunters step; And we owe Austria nothing—but our hate. Enter Albert U. E. R. H. [The Woman rushes forward, followed by Peasantry.] One who was never wont To mock his thoughts by words, doth thank thee, sir. Switzerland may need him. Alb. No words, I pray ye, But let your thanks be shewn in the resuming Of your sports. Eber. (L. H. corner.) You bleed, sir? Alb. It is not worth a thought; I prithee heed me not to mar your festival. Arn. The thoughts alone of blood would do it, sir. Our men are only shadows of their sires; They almost sicken when the chamois falls, Lest they should fall so, and leave a world They scarce dare speak above their bated breath in. We'll in, sir, lest this colour blanch their cheeks. [Bertha advances L. H. C. Come hither, child— This gallant youth hath ta'en some little hurt, And we must play the leech. Ber. Most readily. Arn. (Crosses behind to R.) Now, please you with us, Bertha is well skilled— Alb. Bertha! my mother's name was Bertha! She lov'd the mountains, too, and oft would stray With me alone, e'en when I was a child, Away into the hills, and seat her on some craig And weep, like an imprison'd bird that thirsted For its native woods and their free air again; And as I climb'd some jutting rock, whose height I now o'ertop, (which to my puny strength Did then appear a mountain) she would smile And say her boy should be a hunter. Arn. (Earnestly.) You were born— Alb. Methinks at Kyeburg, For there my earliest recollections concentrate. My father was an Austrian. Arn. Enough, enough! Your wound bleeds freely. I'll lead the way. [Exeunt Arnold, Bertha, Eberhard, and Albert, into Cottage —Gortz, who has been busy with the group, advances L. H.] Gortz. Now, neighbours, prithee range yourselves. Antoine and William lead off—myself and Bertha Follow next, But where is Bertha? Wil. Gone to assist my father in an act Of duty—to attend the wounded Austrian. Gortz. And keep the dance waiting? Wil. No need of that, Good Gortz—you shall take Antoine's hand. I know not why, I cannot but be sad. Gortz. Yes, but Antoine is not Bertha. Prithee think, I have expended a long week's earnings In ribbons, hose, and buckles; all are new; Thrice nigh broke my neck, in practising The most engaging steps upon the peak; Up at sunrise to arrange my points That I might lack no grace these things could give, And now I'm not to dance with Bertha? Is it not sad—grievously sad, William? Wil. Most sad, to thee who hast no thought or hope Beyond a holyday. I'faith, I know not But thou art happier in thy folly. Gortz. True, William, true—still I am no fool. I know if I've a tight shoe I can but Take it off; and if I had a ducat I should need change from a breastknot. You see I'm no fool, though loving folly. But Arnold dreams all day, and talks it too, Of cutting Austrian throats: and now, forsooth, One bleeds, and he must tend him—and Bertha— Wil. Peace, fool! his acts outreach thy reason. Gortz. Fool! fool! If I've a tight shoe I can but Take it off. Fool! If I had a ducat I should need change from a breastknot, I, fool! Enter Hertman, U. E. R. H. Hert. Where is my friend? In this chalet? Gortz. To answer that one needs must know his name. Is that a fool's question, prithee? Hert. His name is Albert. Can thy wit answer? Gortz. Wit, sir! wit! I lack not wit. Had I a— Wil. If it is he who bravely struck the vulture, He is within. Enter Antoine. Gortz. Having his wounds dressed. [Exeunt William and Hertman. I had had wit enough to have said “thanks,” Had I questioned and he answered. Faugh! Ant. Prithee, Gortz, be not so angry. Whose taste But thine could have such ribbons cull'd From out the mercer's store: or having cull'd, Their tints in contrast could have so arrang'd? Whose hose like thine— Gortz. And thou might add—leg, too. Ant. The hose and leg are both upon a par. Gortz. Thou think'st me, then, no fool, nor witless? If I've a ducat— Ant. None could so wisely spend it. Enter Arnold, Hertman, Bertha, Albert (with his arm bound), and William, from the Cottage. Arn. Our tracks, then, lie together. I'll be your guide To Underwalden—and what our homely Chalet can afford shall gladly be your friend's. We owe him much for Switzerland. Alb. Your thanks have more than paid me. [Distant thunder. Hert. Methinks, friend, That your hills give but a boisterous welcome To us of the city. Alb. (To Bertha.) How such fair flowers Can blossom 'midst your tempests, doth exceed The depths of my philosophy to solve. Ber. We love them; for they have rocked our cradles, Have been the partners of our childhood's hours, And taught us to look up to him who guides them, And estimate the worth of human power. Arn. Aye, Bertha, they have taught us this, and more; They've taught us that their master only should be man's, And we deem the hearts that are so fitted To these hills should be their only rulers. I've stood upon the mountain top, and seen The calmness of a summer's evening chang'd Into a war of tempest. Flash after flash Lighted up chasms the bright sun never blest And the loud thunder, like yon mountain stream, Bounding along, kissing each jutting rock, In fearful love, and a hundred echoes Told to a hundred more the tempest secret, Until their lusty voices congregated seem'd To syllable the word that wak'd the world! And then, anon, the elemental sport Hath chang'd to sunshine, and the vale beneath Seemed freshen'd by the game. At many a porch Some hardy mountaineer stood with his eyes Towards heaven, in silent thankfulness That God had only told him of his power. I've stood on that same peak and gazed beneath. No sound was heard but the soft hum of men; The warm sun was beautiful, and the glad soil Shone with its smiles, but every eye around Was earthwards bent in thoughtful sadness. For man hath warr'd with man, and tyranny Hath built her altar there, and every gift Of goodliness and joy she asks as sacrifice. Hert. (Impatiently.) We will resume our course. Arn. I ask your pardon, sirs. I had forgotten The courtesy I owe ye; but in that valley My father's father's bones are mingled, And every flower which springs in beauty there Hath root in some affection. These hills, Which unto you appear but shapeless piles Seem to my eyes beyond the sculptor's art. Yon mountain rivulet's unvarying song Hath for my rugged ear a melody Which shames the silvery language of the harp. Shall not the land which holds such spells as these Be lov'd with all the heart's idolatry? This land is mine—and though th'oppressor's will Hath made a wilderness where all was fair— Though Austrian pride—[Hertman points to the badge of Austria upon his arm.]—True—the storm hath Pass'd away. [As they are going William and Antoine kneel.] Wil. Your blessing, father! Arn. May he that form'd the hills keep ye who tread them Free! that your young hearts may have no pause In your joyful songs of gratitude to him Who made ye in his semblance! Thus, I bless ye! And now, farewell! nor in your songs forget The praises of the immortal Tell! [Arnold ascends the rock with Bertha, Albert, and Hertman] CHORUS. Long as our hills shall be, We must remember thee, Tell! Tell! Echo. Tell! Hark, how the rocks reply, To brave Tell's memory— Remember Tell! Echo. Tell! END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —In the Mountains. Bertha, discovered. “Thou art no woman, if thou canst not love.” Methinks I've found my womanhood full soon, Or, why the converse of three little days With one I never knew ere then, should seem The sweetest of my life? Why should I love? That is a question many a maid hath ask'd Her heart before, and found not a reply. He's bold, and so are they who tread these hills, He's sweet voic'd, and well favoured; so are they Who've asked me for my heart, and I've refused it. Yet do I turn at every tread I hear, and hope 'tis he; Know, without looking on the dial's face,— The hour of his daily walk; can tell his voice,— If it but syllables a word. All this I've learn'd In three short days! He's not that he doth seem! My father says it, and he knows an Austrian. Should he be one, I will not love him more. Hate him I cannot—He comes, he comes! And my heart flutters like a new cag'd bird, Which dreads the hand that brings the food it loves. Enter Albert, L. H. Alb. I cannot now mistrust thy medicine, Leech! The fresh keen air that blows around these peaks, Hath given me back more than my wonted strength, And had the power to lend a brighter glow, E'en to the cheek I thought was brightest. Ber, Fie, fie! to pay me then with such a coin As flattery! I doubt the cure that is So little worth. Your thanks have been too much. Alb. Too much! Too little, were my words all thanks. I would not leave these hills, if I could deem I might consume the day in thanking thee. Ber. Nay, sir, forgive me, if I doubt again You have e'er been a nursling of the court, And train'd to whisper well tuned phrases In ears that prized their music. You would soon tire Of telling homely truths. Time would be heavy wing'd To one who found him fleeter than his wish. Alb. Time is not half the laggard in your hills As in our drowsy courts; but mid the state And ceaseless glitter of a courtier's life, Fancy's fleet changes are too slowly made To feed the palate with variety. E'en the soldier tires amid his praise, Or, dearer than that praise, the privilege Of th'endless repetition of his deeds. Yet, Bertha, they are men who are no braggarts, Men who will live in times that follow them. Ber. Brave men should ever do so.—Think of Tell. Yonder is Uri, where his country's love Hath raised his monument; and if the dead Have after conciousness, how blest to hear His name for ever mingling with pray'rs To the Eternal! Yonder is Rutlis Where Tell and Melcthal, Furst, and Stadfacher, Their holy meetings held, and planned the victory Their after valour gain'd. Yonder the rock On which the hero sprang, when heaven (as though The deed to sanctify) the angry waters still'd, And gave him power to guide his fragile bark Thus far in safety. And here stands Kusnatch Where Gesler fell, and Switzerland was free! Alb. If Switzerland contains so many fair And sweet tongued heralds of her children's valour The wonder is, not that she boasts a Tell Methinks she would have nam'd a hundred. Ber. The stuff they are made of is too costly; The world could not produce them! Enter William at back. Alb. Bertha, thy soul is far too bright a gem To burn amid these hills. O, if a love So pure, its memory would not even foul The snowiest of thy thoughts, where all is pure; If the idolatry of every sense Of him who kneels before thee can outweigh The show of his defects, look but the hope, And at thy father's feet he'd sue as humbly As he doth at thine. Oh, Bertha, answer me! [William advances between them.] Wil. I will for her father answer, not for her. Arnold of Winkelried would take her hand As I now take it, and, pointing to the lake That lies beneath, would tell her its waters Kiss a land whose freedom was gladly bought By her forefather's blood from Austrian Tyranny. He'd tell her that those hills Are named Mogartem, where a Tell, And some such other noble hearts and hands Drove Austria's thousand steel-clad knights Before them like the timid chamois. Her answer I could once have prophesied; I now can only wonder— Ber. William! Brother! How meanly am I rated in your love, Since you can wrong me even by a doubt! 'Tis thus that Arnold's daughter would reply:— She'd tell him, that her love, her hope Which are her all, were given to her country: That Austria's proudest noble she would spurn, As she does him, who would have tempted her To ask a father's hate! Has your wonder ceas'd Or would you question further? Wil. Bertha, I've wrong'd thee! Back to your court, and tell them what you deem Is freedom's price! I'll send a guide to lead you From our hills. Farewell, sir! [Going.] Alb. Bertha, one word! The times are fraught with peril; another day May see the hungry vulture's appetite Allay'd by human blood. Promise to me, That should your father's home become no shelter, And your father's arm no safeguard to thee, That he who peril'd thee, shall only shield thee, Ber. Think'st thou I have one father only? The cause would give me thousands, Or that the land He'd gladly die for, has but one sepulchre? Look at yon ravine! [Exeunt William and Bertha, R. H. Alb. There must be more in freedom than we deem Who, nurs'd among the servile slaves of power, Would bend all wills to ours, since it can lend So much of nature's majesty to those The mountain tops have only school'd and cradled. [Exit L. H. SCENE II. —Exterior of Arnold's Cottage. Arnold disoovered at a Table beneath the projecting caves. Arn. (Rises,) Well, well! ingrate Berne may play the craven; Another Laupen yet may come, and swords be Wanting. Uri, Schwytz, Lucerne, and Underwalden— We need not Berne! but let her from her hills Behold the conflict, and blush to think no sword Of her's is there to aid the cause of Freedom. But when, oh! when will Switzerland be roused And bid us tread these mountains free As our great fathers left them. Enter Eberhard, 2 E. L. H. hastily—he seizes Arnold's arm and looks wildly at him. Eber. Is yon blue arch the heavens? Is this the earth We stand on? Look I the thing called man? Or have I dream'd of such a world, or now Talk but the thoughts of one who sleeps aloud? Shake me Arnold! Shake this torpor from me, That I may wake to consciousness. Arn. My friend This wildness— Eber. I am changed then! you see it? 'Tis a reality, and now we'll talk of vengeance; You have a daughter Bertha? Arn. What of her? Eber. You love her? Arn, As my hopes—What then? Speak man! Nor let me read your looks into my death! Eber. If Austrian lust should rob you of her? Arn. They dare not—by Heaven they dare not! A miracle would save her! Th'insensate Avalanche would be endued with reason, And desolate the world to save my child From such a living hell—'Tis impossible! Eber. Thus did I deem, until my only child Became a damning proof that it was possible. This morn I stood beside my Chalet's door, Lost in a vision of our expected peace, Peopling the vale beneath me with the free, When one wild cry broke through my waking dream: 'Twas my Antoine's voice; though now so fraught With mad distress, none but a parent's ear Had traced her wonted sound in that exclaim. Age from my limbs its iron grasp relax'd, And gave me back the vigour of my youth: Another moment found me by my child. Her eyes were tearless—her deep agony Had dried their fountains up; but they were fixed In such a look of madness and despair, That my blood curdled in my veins from fear. I gazed around, not knowing what I sought, When down the steep I saw the stranger who was At her wedding. Not he who slew the vulture. I strove to call for help—my tongue refused Its office—My limbs seem'd chang'd to marble I felt as one who, on a drifting wreck, Watches the lessening sail of lone a bark Which could have rescued him. A deep groan from My child brought me again to reason; anon She seem'd to burst from some absorbing trance That had been all of horror in her hand She claps'd this jewel. The truth flashed on me! Yes, Arnold she, that a few days past Thou blest in innocence as William's wife, The spoiler hath destroy'd. Arn. And Bertha? Eber. May be the next for immolation! Arn. The next! not gone, then! Praise, praise Heaven, praise! Oh, selfish nature how gladly do we snatch The cup of grief from lips we love the most, Nor care whose hand receives the draught from ours! Eber. Do not rejoice Arnold, 'till thou hast dug a cave In some far mountain's side, and there thy child Inhum'd, and piled another mountain on her tomb, Until corruption has consumed her form. Nought else can save her. Virtue's no safeguard; More peril than she's fair; mine was pure as lovely. How have I trembled when disease has marr'd A while her infant cheek, lest its rude touch Should leave a trace behind. It had been kindness To have sear'd it o'er with burning irons, Though her cries benumb'd her parent's ear for ever. Arn Nay cheer thee, man, nor bend thus to thy grief, For if we weigh our blessings with our ills, How much we all are debtors for some good. Eber. But picture thy loved child the thing she is, And what mine has become—oh, it is misery! Arn. No more, no more! I feel its full extent, Though I have strove to hide mine own from thee Beneath the mockery of a seeming patience. I dare not think upon the desolated hopes Of my poor William, for it would madden me. We will to Stantz, brother, with this wrong; And if these forms of men have hearts within Of human mould or substance, we'll be avenged By their own meted justice. If not, no man In Switzerland but is a sharer In this our cause; and on each hill shall blaze The funeral pyre of Austria's tyranny. [Exeunt R. H. SCENE III. —Interior of William's Cottage. Antoine and Bertha, discovered. Ant. Hark! 'tis his footsteps! where shall I hide me! I cannot look upon my husband more. No, he comes not. The lightning's not more sure Of searing where it strikes, than is this tale To wither up his heart. Oh, William! [Weeps] Ber. Sister be calm, I pray thee love, be calm. Ant. I will—as lies the wreck upon the treach'rous sea,— Like to a bird asleep, but in a moment sinks Into its yawning grave. I will be calm. [Horn sounds.] Ah! that is his horn! where is the joyous thrill Which at that sound did vibrate in my heart Until my cheek did blush at mine own joy? How chang'd, cold, cold as the death I sigh for! My cheek burns as though a living story Of my shame was written there so palbably The veriest child might read it. [Horn sounds again.] It tells him nearer; but no joy—no joy! Ber. I know not what to urge; these mighty griefs O'erpower each feeble barrier love would stay Their desolating course with. Sister be firm Nor let my brother's misery be enlarged, By deeming all is lost together. Ant. Aye! The poison'd cup were better lost than tasted. Oh my brain, my brain! it seems to snap and burn! Ber. Sister, dear sister! Ant. That's he! that's he! I know him by the jewel in his cap. Approach me not. I'll leap this precipice! A serpent round me seems to wreath its coils Where his accurs'd arms embraced me! Are there no spots upon my cheek! I feel His kisses burning here and here; his pois'nous breath Still floats around my nostrils, would it could kill! [Falls into chair.] Ber. Did not their fathers bless them, when they wedded? But good men's prayers have lost their power. Ant. Who wedded? Ay, I was a bride but yesterday, Where are the flowers they twin'd among my hair? Gone! I'll gather others, or he I wedded Will say I prize him not. [To Bertha.] I should know this face? Ber. 'Tis Bertha, thy loved companion, sister. Ant. Hark! heard ye not footsteps? no, no. Do not tremble, girl; 'twas but my fancy. But I have cause to dread a heavier tread Than thine. And so thou art in love, And would'st be wedded? I'll be your bridesmaid: I'll gather weeds and nettles for thy braid,—no flowers; They cradle wasps. Ber. This doth overpower my strength! Ant. (Sings.) My lover's on the mountain, And the even time is com And then his horn will sound, Will sound— I forgot the rest—it tells of happiness, No marvel that its memory is gone! Ber. Oh, my poor brother! thou wilt come anon As one who watches for the home bound bark That holds the treasured inmates of his heart, And finds upon the beach a shattered wreck To tell the mournful fate of those he loved! Ant. Austrian! I say I'm a Switzer's wife, Who will not tamely brook a wrong like this! Ber. There is no Austrian here—none but thy Bertha! There—lay thy burning brow upon my bosom And we will seek the cool and fresh'ning air. Ant. Aye, to the peak! the loftiest peak that rears Its head among the clouds—we can weep there And none will mock our tears—Come William, come! [William calls without “Antoine!”] Ah! he calls my name and I dare not reply! [Falls on the ground—William enters and stands horror stricken.] END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III SCENE I. —A Forest, Enter Arnold supporting Eberhard, L. H. Arn. Cheer brother, cheer! 'Tis scarce an arrow's flight To Stantz, beyond the forest; we have not journey'd Half a hunter's day. How often have we trod The mountain's side together, and thought the sun A niggard of its light! Eber. I had a wife then, And my Antoine to cheer me midst my toil; I heeded not the blast that rudely smote My cheek. I knew it reach'd not them, and midst Its hollow howlings I could hear the lispings Of my cherub, and the sweet tone of welcome From her mother. Where are they now? where? where? The echo in my heart is still; it dares Not answer. Last night methought, Arnold, that I stood again beside the little couch Of my Antoine. She was once more a child; Her mother at her head was kneeling, whilst The joy of her full heart found vent in tears. As o'er the slumberer's cheek the light of peace Stole from its sunny home in her pure heart. And as I gazed, methought a deadly asp Circled her snowy neck, and spread its pois'nous venom Through her veins., I woke in my fierce agony And did curse the tears then warm upon my cheek, For sorrowing at such a death. Arn. No more of this, Or I shall play the woman, and we have need To wear no hearts to day. We'll shed no tears But drops of crimson hue, which our true Swords shall draw! Eber. Thine are glorious hopes, Arnold. Our country must be free, but I shall be No sharer in her freedom. Mine will be The freedom of the grave. Oh! my poor child I thought thy hands would strew fresh flow'rs o'er me, And thy tears bedew the turf upon my bosom! But thou wilt wither with me! Arn. Put on the man! Thine's not the only grief in Switzerland Worth tears: am I no sharer in this sorrow? Mine eye is tearless! We should know no grief That's selfish. How many eyes are sentinel's o'er us, And can'st thou be a craven? The fates Of thousands yet unborn are with us now, The sluggish spirit of the cringing serf Is most alive to nature's holy voice, Will he not hug his offspring to his breast, When whispering gossips anger o'er this tale, Until the warmth of his affection thaws The icy channels of his heart? His shade will grow Too heavy for his arm, and his oppressor's words Fall grating on his ear, until his thraldom Poisons his cup and board, and leaves him nothing But the bitterness of life. Eber. Bear with me, brother; And deem me not unworthy of our land; But she was all that time had left me; The only stay that propp'd my sinking age. I could gaze on her, when my heart was sad, And far away, with my dead hopes, until They seem'd to live again in her, but now I stand Like to some blighted tree, around whose trunk The creeping ivy stole, gave and to it The semblance of a verdure; but a rude hand Hath pluck'd its borrowed life, and left it Nothing. Lend me thine arm, Arnold. Her mother (when we meet in heaven) shall not Reproach me, that her child could find no advocate. Arn. 'Tis well, 'tis well. How icy is his grasp! The fountain of his life is freezing up; The sun is set that warmed it. [Exit R. H. SCENE II. —Court of Rudolph at Stantz. Rudolph, Hertman, and Officers discovered. Rud. They talk of freedom, do they? words kill not. Hert. Nor does the trumpet's blast: but it awakens The slumbering resolution into Action. Rud. They must be silenc'd, and that Quickly; ere the infection spreads too wide. Enter a Servant, L. H. Servant. A brother of the convent of St. Dominic Hath brought this letter from the holy abbot, And craves your lordship's instant reading. [Gives letter—Rudolph signs to him to leave] [Exit Servant, L. H. Rud. What means this, Hertman? Hert. I can opine not; Unless the troops, despairing of their pay Have foraged on the monks. Rud. (Reads.) “To Lord Rudolph— These:—a most unseemly outrage on our Convent has been perpetrated; The image of the blessed virgin broken; The holy vessels of the church defiled By bacchanal excesses” (no novelty Methinks) A silver censor stolen, by your Troops, as by a testimony most clearly Proved; for which we ask reprisal at your hand. “Gustavus, Abbot of St. Dominic.” Hert. The holy man is not o'er humble. Rud. Humility ne'er looks from 'neath a cowl Perchance the eye of cringing supplication May glisten there, fed by the hopes of gain But ne'er humility no monarch like a monk, Who rules men by their fears and makes their sins The taxers of their wealth. Your rousing friar Is the only king. He lives right jollily His head ne'er throbs with racking cares of state: The only ache he knows is from the fumes Of the past night's o'er spiced wassail, A thriving wooer he; for such ready sinners In their hearts are women 'tis only love To err and be forgiven. Now I'd be sworn, The leanest of their brood they send as Messenger, lest well fed sides and ruby cheeks Should tell of well paid dues, and their ill uses. Hert. (R. H.) But they're no jesters, when the laugh costs gold. Rud. (R. H.) True Hertman, we must provide the means To satisfy their claim. Their wily tongues Are stronger than our swords. I'd rather fight The devil than Sir Priest, arm'd with book and Bead. Hert. 'Twere easy to transfer, the robber's title From the state's soldiery to the state's serfs, And to repay the charges of these monks. Compel the grumbling slaves to toil and tax So leave your treasury a gainer. Rud. Thanks. My better genius. The holy men Will only note the produce of the mine, Nor think upon the workers of the ore. To night the walls of good St. Dominic Shall echo with the praises of our love. So largely will we pay with others gold. I fain would be at vespers with them, Hertman; The bell that rings them there to night will be Of brighter metal than their matin's call; The grape's rich tears will be more freely pour'd Than penitental drops. Should we lose Our honours in the state, we will turn monk And be a king indeed. Enter Servant, L. H. Servant. My lord, two men without are clamorous For admittance. They're from the mountains, And say they have sustained much wrong Which they will not divulge to any ear But thine. Rud. Methinks they are over nice! I like the thought on't. Goatherds, sirs, at court? Look to your daughters, barons, or ye'll have Perchance some lusty sons-in-law. For ourself We needs must learn to doff our cap with grace To welcome them with all due courtesy. [To Servant.] Back to the slaves, and tell them they forget Their breeding strangely. Swine and deer ne'er herd Together that I wot of. The times are chang'd My lords, and we must heed the aspect of them. You, Gesler, have the memory of an act, That left your great grandfather childless, And men whose hair is white, have heard their sires Tell o'er the wounds they got from hunters spears, [Arnold without L. H.] Strike at your peril! I do not hunt the wolf With childhood's spear of lath. Rud. This looks revolt When even to our beards they breathe their threats. Enter Arnold with a staff in his hand supporting Eberhard, who appears overpowered with fatigue and grief,] How is it, sirs? Some kid has gone astray And you do need our yagers to reclaim The wanderer,—or perchance the tempest Has uptorn your vineyards—or the chase Been unsuccessful, and ye would our coffers Drain? Is it not so? I pray ye not to lack The breath to ask it. [Arnold places Eberhard against a pillar and presses his hand encouragingly.] Arn. Thinkst thou our only ills Are those of Heaven's decreeing? Would they were so, We should know their justice! If the tempest Eats into our wealth, we know it is impartial; If the chase leaves us an empty board, We think upon the plenty of the past, and hope The future will repay us. We come not now To ask the beggar's mite. We have a debt Your master's kingdom would not half repay To our full bosoms. This old man's whole wealth Of heart is gone, to feed the craving lust Of one among your court retainers. Rud. How know ye that? Arn. The eyes that now are veil'd In honest shame beheld him. A father's eye Doth never look upon his offsprings wronger But to convey the memory to the brain Indelible and true. His child has had her innocence pluck'd out To please your wills. The casket now is empty, And she so lacks the jewel it contain'd, She has gone mad with weeping for the gem. Eber. (Starts.) Mad, Arnold! my child mad? Arn. Aye, brother, That mind, the summer of thy life was given To train to beautiful perfection Is now a waste! Eber. (Falls.) Oh, powers of mercy! [Attendants advance to raise him.] Arn. Back! fellows! back! his garments shall not smell E'en of your touch. Eber. (L. H.) Arnold, those words were kindly Spoken, for they have snapp'd the slender thread Which held my spirit to this earth—my child! [Dies] Arn. (C.) Eberhard! old friend—old friend [Places his hand on Eberhard's hand.] All is still! He has outran me in the race of life. Rud. (R. H.) He is not dead? Arn. As surely as thou liv'st To judge between us, let not his spirit Appeal to heaven to right his sum of wrong; And though the living evidence is not, This bauble, which the struggling victim pluck'd [Shows a jewel.] From her destroyer's breast, may testify Against him. Hert. My lord, what show of injury These men do bring attaches to myself. Arn. Is this a man, and does he own this deed Without a deeper tint than dyes his cheek At pray'rs or acts of godliness? I fain would touch thee, sir; that I may know Thou art of mortal substance; and no shadow Thou seemest of us; perchance thy form is given As sculptur'd marble o'er the mouldering dead, To hide the foulness of the thing within. Rud. Reserve thy wonder for thy fellow's ears What would you ask of us? gold? Arn. Gold! if gold Can link the subtleties of reason Again together in the perfect chain Their giver left them, or resuscitate The dead that lies before thee, or pluck out The gnawing sorrows of a hopeless life— The gift were welcome. Were the vast world Of thrice refined gold,—its hills all heaps Of time defying diamond, the least of that It could not purchase, would its worth outweigh, The deity you worship so devoutly Is not the one we bow to on the hills! What would ye demand, if that good old man Had been the partner of your glad boyhood. The steady friend of life's maturer years, The expected partner of your autumn's peace And thus he lay struck by a random shaft, And I the shooter? Pause ere you reply; And mark how well the sinewy limbs are formed; How much the lofty brow proclaims the man; And let thy fancy conjure back the fire That life could give to those still glassy orbs. Then look around the nobles of your court And point me one he did not more than peer! Rud. What boaster's this, my lords, that dares to placo The carrion with the eagle's of the land? Rud. Arnold of Winkelried. Rud. Arnold the rebel! Whose tongue is ever wagging of some ill. His trait'rous thought alone is father to. Our spies have made that name not over welcome. Arn. Ah! Rud. And he who could have been so much to thee Is Eberhard of Lucerne? Said I not rightly? Arn. Most rightly; and since you know his worth, Repay it on this man! Rud. It is repaid The rebel's death hath paid the rebel's deeds; And thank our mercy that the braggart breath Thou hast to day so prodigally spent Is left thee to recount. Arn. Your mercy! I'll use it sirs, for that; I'll lay this corse Before his children's eyes, and bid them thank Your mercy for the quiet of the grave! Rud. Hurl out the prating slave! Arn. (He raises the body of Eberhard up.) Thou'rt deaf! Thou'rt deaf! And hear'st not that I'm called slave by a slave? Rud. Why am I not obey'd? Away with him! [An attendant advances to Arnold.] Arn. Lay but a finger on me, cringing hound! And I will lay thee prostrate at my feet! Slave! Let me take my burthen. [As Arnold raises the body of Eberhard, the scene closes.] SCENE III. The Valley. Enter William from his Cottage—Time sunset. Wil. Not yet at rest? Oh, thou untiring sun, When wilt thou leave to night her empire? Thou art too bright for misery to gaze on. It would have all things dreary as its hopes! Joy is thy comrade, who with elastic bound Springs from his couch to hail thee, feeling thy light Attuned to all his thoughts, bright and gladsome, And runs with thee his daily course of toil, Nor breathes a sorrow but in bidding thee Good night! How I have lov'd thee, when at eve I've watch'd the peak, thou'st circled with a crown The ores and gems of earth could ne'er have equall'd! And thought when next thou camest to light the world, I should be there to hail both thee and her whom Each succeeding day left more worth loving. [Turns to window.] There she sits, like one of those ethereal beings Weeping hearts deem the lov'd dead are chang'd to, Moveless and wordless as a stone Niobe! [He stands gazing at the window.] Enter Bertha, 1 E. R. H. Ber. Is there no sound beyond the power of words? No signs, beyond our tears, and smiles, to tell To those who sorrow that we hope, but have not? Weep my brother, weep; grief from her tears Comfort alone distils, The music of thy mind Is like an untuned harp, the sweetest minstrel Could only waken discord by his touch Yet I must speak to thee; my heart's so charg'd With love and sorrow, that I feel I need Myself a comforter when I should play it. William! Brother! Wil. Speak not to me, Bertha, I would forget the present, and the past: For they do mock each other, and thy voice Brings them in mad collision. The hopes Of my young life are overthrown by to day's Miseries. Things that I once did love Are now become so hateful to my thinking, That I do loathe the very air I breathe, Because it blows so freshly. I would have it Clogg'd with enfeebling breaths, till memory Became lost in the brain's confusion. May curses— Ber. Hold, William! man's curses smite No head but his who breathes them—you are but man; Nor show yourself below thy name's dignity In striving to o'ertop it. The maniac talks Alone of empires that the earth hath not As his possessions. Be thou content to be That which your father is—truly a man Go! tell your wrongs aloud, until our hills Do ring their echo round throughout the land. Wil. And tell her shame. [Crosses R. H.] Ber. Whom do we pity, The fool who madly leaps the precipice Or him the avalanche overwhelms? They would strike with thee, aye, and weep with thee; And no swords dimm'd by tears of pity's shedding! Enter Arnold hastily, averting his face from William, L. H. Arn. How fares Antoine? Wil. As the tree, father, The lightning's blasted, that still wears some show Of life though sear'd and blacken'd. Arn. Oh, for an eagle's course without its appetites! To fly around the world without a master; To look into the fulness of the sun, And blink not; to take my rest upon some craig No foot hath trod but mine, and ruff my plumage In the fresh'ning air I never breath'd—a slave! Ber. Father! You look not as you wont. So wild, I do nigh tremble! Arn. Dost thou, girl, at me? That's well! would I could change my nature. I blush for that call'd human. I could be Any beast, so that it had the power of killing. Eberhard is dead. Wil. and Ber. Dead! Arn. Aye, dead! Why should you doubt it? are we so safely hous'd That it, should seem impossible? Wil. When died he? Arn. When his life was of most worth, to day, In the court of Rudolph. Before their eyes He fell lifeless from grief, now mark their justice! They offered for the dead their paltry gold; The living spurn'd it, and then (oh, mighty Mercy) they bid us thank them for a quiet grave And call'd me slave! Ber. My father, slave! Wil. Go on, sir, pray go on. It is so glad a tale I would all Switzerland were here to hear it. I deemed my soul had only own'd one shrine: I was mistaken. Prithee go on, sir. Arn. I said the thing they called me—'Tis true I knew that long ago; but did not think Others dare name me so. 'Twas loudly said Some fifty ears were listeners round about. Would those that I could name had heard it too. Mine tingle with it now. Ber. And mine father! Arn. We have spies too, feeding on our words. Wil. Oh, for an Austrian throat within my grasp [Looks off R. H.] Great heaven! dost thou approve my wish, or do my Senses, O'er wrought by these afflictions shape the air Into my mind's desire? It is, it is—an Austrian! [Rushes out R. H.] Ber. 'Tis Albert! Father! father! heed'st thou not What William said? Save him! save him! He has him by the throat—they near the brink— A fall would lose them both. Arn. One is our foe, Heaven will shield the other. Ber. They're parted He flies this way! Arn. Who flies! Ber. William! Arn. Flies Before an Austrian! how now! a craven? Enter William, with a miniature, R. H. Wil. Is not this my mother? Arn. Like, very like The soul is absent; the eyes are far too tame How camest thou by it? Wil. The Austrian wore it. Around his neck it hung, and as my eye Fell on it, my mother's voice rang in mine ear; Its euphony again and still'd my wrath. Albert runs in. Alb. William and Arnold! I ask mine own again Or by my troth I'll have a recompense. [Draws.] I would not ye should pay—I hold my life More valueless than that ye have despoiled Me of. It is my mother's picture, sirs. Arn. Enough! 'tis here. Now answer me I pray thee Your name is Eyloff? Alb. How know you that, sir? Arn. By that same evidence you call your mother. Her Sister was the mother of this boy. Alb. She was then of the mountains? Ber. (Faintly.) Thank God! Thank god! Arn. My child! [Bertha sinks into Arnold's arms.] END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. —Hall in Rodolph's Palace. Razman and Servitz seated at a Table, with Wine. Raz. O for a lonely grot beside a brook— A table spread with only book and lamp, A cruse well filled with water from the spring, A larder stored with fruits and dainty roots, And I should hang myself. In truth, good coz, Thine is a drowsy court. Saving thy presence, And the good wine ye give, a hermit Need not wish a cell to 'scape from company. Have ye no laughers here? or do ye make Your good count's face a mirror for your own? Ser. Thine is such greedy mirth, it cannot brook A serious hour in the whole year's course. Raz. When a man toils and starves, let him look sad— 'Tis vile ingratitude when toil is rare, And recompence abundant, not to smile. I've worn a merry face some thirty years, And see, I have not won the jester's hire— A threadbare doublet, and a bruised skin. I hate the sight of tears, unless they roll From joyousness. Sparkling laughter-tears, There are no gems so bright—they're nought But sunshine. Enter Lutold, L. H. Lut. Count Rudolph, Servitz, doth require Your presence instantly. Ser. I will attend his pleasure. [Exit Lut. L. H. Raz. If he looks sad, I pray thee shut thine eyes. Drink not his vinegar, and make wry faces. Ser. Take heed thy sweeter draught needs no repentance! [Exit Servitz, L. H. Raz. If't does I will do penance, and that shall be To keep no company but thine, my cousin. Some call thee foe, good wine, but quaff thee still. Where is the friend would give his blood, like thee, To aid the current of another's heart? Thou hail'st the needy ever with a smile; Bid'st age forget his wrinkles, youth his fears; Makest the happy lovers dream more bright, And he that sighs o'er faithlessness and scorn Forget his sorrows in thine honest kiss. Come, soul with soul, we'll mingle! [Drinks.] Thine is A sweet one! One more embrace! What though the lazy morn Is scarce awake, thou'lt make the sun look brighter. [Drinks again. Art thou divining, mistress mine, or is your mixture Of the ass and man—a thing of our dull earth? Enter Gortz, L. H. timidly—a Basket on his arm, and a Pipe slung at his side. Gortz. Your pardon, noble sir. I'm a simple peasant— Raz. Therefore more welcome than the wisest sage. Canst laugh? Gortz. Marry, aye, when I've occasion. Raz. Give me thine hand, then: I love laughter, But 'tis a sport that here is out of date. What can'st thou seek among those sober sirs? Gortz. My cousin Peter. Raz. I'm he! Gortz. Nay, sir, you jest— Though 'tis five years—aye, five this vintage— Since I saw him. Raz. Thine's a true memory— 'Tis just five years. Gortz. Dost thou know my cousin Peter? Raz. Am not I he? Thy name is— Gortz. Gortz, sir. Raz. So I would have said. Gortz. Go to, sir—my cousin Is a smaller man than thee. Raz. Rather he was! I am that Peter, but I have fed since then On courtly airs, which swell a pigmy Into a Colossus. The lacquey of to-day, Who bends him to your very shoe-tie, deeming It honour to remove its soil, the morrow Finds big with the dignity of station, And his late tone of meek submission Chang'd to full breath'd, sound, and pompous Wording. His eye, too's grown fix'd and fiery, Not wandering from the earth unto your cap, Then from your cap to earth again. He spurns The fare he erst deem'd dainty, which now His fashioned appetite condemns as only fit For menial stomachs. How doth my aunt, Thy mother? Gortz. Well, I thank thee. But thou art Not Peter. Yet how knew thee I'd a mother? Raz. A certain ancient usage of the world Forbids that any should be born without one. Gortz. But art thou truly Peter? Raz. I'll prove it to thee Thou play'st on the pipe! Gortz. Certes, do I! (It must be he—yet, mercy, how he's chang'd! Cousin was stunted in his growth, but his hair Was just that hue. I'll touch upon the twenty Livres that we owe him. He seems in tune To grant a longer day.) Well, cousin Peter— If thou art really he—I've come to ask— (No, I was not to ask 'till I had given) [Shows Basket, and places it on the table. I've brought thee, cousin Peter, a score of eggs, A new cheese, and some rare nectarines. Look at their rosy cheeks! fresh gather'd— Every one pluck'd by this little hand. Raz. Most generous cousin! Gortz. Oh! I had nigh forgot— My mother's blessing, too! Raz. Most thoughtful aunt! Gortz. And I was to ask thy patience for thy debt. Raz. What debt? Gortz. The twenty livres that my mother Borrow'd. Raz. Speak not of them—I grant The quittance of that debt. Gortz. (Runs to table.) Thou art not Peter! Give me back my cheese, my eggs, my fruit! He could have never chang'd so much as this! To give up claim to gold—full twenty livres! Were it but a batz, he would have forced Full payment of his coin! Raz. Look at this doublet! Wore Peter such as this, when Peter lent His money to thy mother? Gortz. Marry, no! Raz. The coat can change the man; so has it chang'd Me from the thrifty griping thing I was To that thou seest me. Twenty livres! pshaw! The lacing of my vest cost twice that sum, And think'st thou I'd wear lace and vex a kinsman For a paltry debt? not I! Come, man, we'll try The flavour of thy fruit, and thou shalt pledge me In a brimming cup. [Fills.] Health to our cousinship! Servitz enters with a Packet in his hand. [To Servitz.] I've found a kinsman in this worthy youth, And he would fain forswear me. Gortz. (Drinks.] I'll ne'er again. Raz. Thou'lt join us in a cup? Ser. I heed not one, Though “post haste” was my orders. [Drinks.] A messenger Has brought here tidings that Underwalden And some other states are rising, and I'm despatch'd To Gesler's quarters, with instant orders To oppose the rebels. Raz. [Drinks.] I'll with thee, then. A mountain ride will help digestion. Gortz. (As they are going.) Cousin! cousin! Raz. Oh, my blessing to my aunt! [Exeunt Razman and Servitz, L. H. Gortz. (Looks after them.) I've heard my grandmother, on winter nights, Tell wondrous tales of fays and fairy lands, Where men are chang'd to princes by a touch. This must be it if that's my cousin Peter. I feel myself a mighty difference. When first I set my foot within this palace My knees did smite each other, and my breath Came but by parcels then; but now I feel As valiant as a bull. Marry, this drink Is no bad stirrer of one's valour. [Drinks.] And have I Not learned a secret of the state—seen A dispatch that bears his lordship's seal, And that within an hour? No marvel, then, That he has grown so great. I'll home again! How many a mouth will gape to hear my tale Of cousin Peter and the State's affairs. [Exit L. H. SCENE II. —The Mountains. Sunset. Albert discovered, in the dress of a Hunter. Alb. Oh, mighty Nature! how powerful is the hold Thou hast on our affections! The tinsel'd shows And mockeries of the world may for a while Win us from thy worship, but with what joy We turn again to thee, no more to wander! I am thy child, ye hills! I feel I love Thy rugged forms as thing that memory Hath hung with gems. The path I deemed The nimble goat could not in safety tread, My foot doth cleave to. I will not leave ye! [The “Ranz de Vaches” is played at a distance. That air! it was my mother's song, which sooth'd My infant thoughts to slumber. Comes it now To sound its sweet approval to my heart For daring to be free? Oh, speak to me again! [The Air is again played, and he stands listening attentively. Enter Gortz, L. H. Gortz. The world's chang'd! human nature's chang'd! Would I could change with them! Here have I As grand a secret as ever fill'd the pate Of a prime minister, and not a listener Can I gain! “Psha!” says one. “Fool!” says Another. But none will listen, though 'tis a secret Not for everyday carrying. Certes, I sometimes lie; but then 'tis for their pleasure. They like news, and if the world breeds it not Fast enough for their stomach's, where's the harm In fancying what might be? Yet now I'm “fool!” Fool, quotha! If I've a tight shoe—take it off. Ha! a stranger! hem! a good morrow, friend! Bless me! he seems as deaf as Mount Righi! [The Air is heard again. Alb. It is some spell my mother's holy spirit Hath shed around me. Again she speaks! Gortz. Mad, by the Virgin! That is the Ranz de Vaches. Alb. But 'twas my mother's song! Gortz. She kept cows, then, Or goats, very likely. My mother does likewise. Alb. And keeps you as a dog to bark them home. Prithee attend thy calling! send home the cows! Gortz. (Turns away.) Dog! If I've a ducat—but, no matter— He is the loser, not I. My secret Will not grow musty. I'll to Arnold's cottage— If it is of ill to Austria, he has ear for it. I wish he would look this way, I'd play the dog, And snarl at him. He knows not the dog's tale, though! [Exit L. H. Alb. Methinks, my mother, thou art with me here, I feel so like a child. A wild new joy My reason can define not fills my soul, Like that which filled it, when my infant thought Compass'd its first expression. It was thy name, My mother, that I breath'd, and o'er and o'er I echoed the word (for thou has told me so) As the first minstrel tried the new-born sound From his rude lyre of shell. Each joy'd the more; His, that the magic tone obey'd his touch— Mine that thy smile rewarded the essay. Enter Bertha, thoughtfully, L. H. No joy is full till we have found a sharer In the gift— Ber. Then I'm not her thou seek'st. I can become a partner in no joy— Scarcely in a sorrow: that which I have Has grown so mighty it nigh bursts my heart. Alb. I should have spoke of freedom. Bertha. A fitting theme, Where in our homes the spoiler breathes and taints The freshest of our loves. We wither up As the scorched leaf. We see the bold man weep And do not thank his tears. Our women look Behind them as they run, and at a brother's Voice do tremble, till their eyes assure them That the sound is harmless. Alb. These are old griefs! Ber. Almost too old! For men have looked them Till they do scarce behold their ugliness! Their swords within their sheaths should rattle, And tell their thirst for vengeance! Alb. These are bold words, more fitted for the camp And boastful soldiers' mouths, than these green hills And lips whose dew might tempt the roving bee. Ber. Albert, thou hast my heart! I know not why— But yet thou hast it! Let me not deem thee less Than thou must be to avoid my hate. The courtly dame may thank thee for this tune— I ask the rough untutor'd language Of manly honesty! Antoine is dead! I cannot weep, for she is with the blest! Alb. And William— Ber. Sits like an unmated dove Beside her, wreathing the faded flowers She wore upon her bridal midst her hair, Fit emblems of her love, and gems her cheek With tears so quickly shed, the wearied hand Doth cease to wipe them off! Alb. And Hertman lives! Had I a thousand lives, each should be given To avenge this injury! I will to Stantz, He dares not for his soldier's honour Refuse to meet my challenge. Ber. No, not to Stantz; She needs not an avenger! already Hath this wrong become the evening's tale By every hearth. A single life will not repay it! To-night the Lion League Meet to concert the means for our deliverance! Be thou amongst them, and let them find Thy hand as ready as thy willing word. Betray us not—my troth is pledged for thine. Alb. I will redeem it, Bertha! So rich a pledge Could never be belied. Thou shall'st not blame Thy love that it did fall into my keeping. [Exeunt R. H. SCENE III. —A Valley. Time, Twilight—which gradually changes to moonlight. A rude bier on one side, on which are laid the bodies of Eberhard and Antoine, covered with a mantle. Peasantry cross at back. Arnold discovered. A change comes o'er the land. Men wear their eyes More to their fellow's faces, and when they pause They look towards heaven, as if in gratitude For some expected blessing, thanking the hope They deem forerunner of the coming good. Hand grasps hand as though an asseveration Was by the pressure seal'd irrevocably. And yet the oppressor's tread is heavier On their necks than ever. Still they look glad, And seeming smile. 'Tis the convulsive joy beam Fear, when expiring, lends to his scarce living victim. [Merry music is heard without Methinks a wail should be the only music Switzerland should hear—a lament for the Living, [Laugh of the Peasantry is heard Now they are slaves who thus do laugh; The worst of slaves, for they are bondsmen here, In the very land their fathers left them free, They feel the shackle and the whip, and yet they laugh— But their joy's empty as the airy globe An infant's breath doth blow in pastime up, Which hath a moment's life, and then 'tis gone! A Male and Female Peasant enters with Gortz, playing on his Pipe, U. E. R. H. Peace, minstrel! peace, I pray thee! art thou Swiss? Gortz. I am—thou knowest me, Arnold—I'm Gortz! Arn. Ye look like men—[Turns from them.]—but yonder fleecy clouds Will sometimes shape themselves to things of life And still are only vapour. Get home! get home! Gortz. Marry, Arnold, you wrong us. Men are we— At least those that wear a beard upon their chins. Arn. (Thoughtfully.) Thou wast at my son's wedding? Gortz. Most truly Have I cause to memory that day. Arn. And so have I. Gortz. What didst thou expend Thine all in ribbons, paints, and buckles? Arn. Aye, all to the last mite! Gortz. I saw them not! Arn. No, no, I wore them here—my heart was dressed In all hope's brightest colours. My poor boy! How have they faded! You, I said, was there When my boy wedded. Gortz. And I denied it not. Arn. You saw the strife between the lammer-geyer And the poor goat? Gortz. I had no eyes else. Arn. Tell the story, as you journey on, Among your absent fellows, and remember The weak one conqured! Gortz. I will. Arn. Now get ye home, And look upon your children at their play— [Peasants cross to L. H. And think what ye would do, if from the hills A ravenous wolf assailed them! Think and act. [Exeunt Gortz and Peasants, L. H. Enter Walter, Martin, and other Confederates, U. E. R, H. Brothers! this looks like action, when old men Leave their beds to mark the dial's face When shadow'd by the moon. Welcome, brothers! Wal. Sleep hath lost its charms in Underwalden. Men there are whose stern and reverend looks Tell not the reveller stirring; and youths Who wear their twentieth summer green on Their unwrinkled brows, walk silently along Fearing to break the stillness by their breath. Mar. A minstrel brought this pipe to me, and said It was a useless bauble; that men now frown'd Upon him and his tune, who erst had given Them both a welcome. He bade me keep it— (For it was the pipe his grandsire used to play), As men now seemed to love the bell-like sound Of glittering iron better than his reed. Arn. 'Tis well, brothers! I this morning stood Beside a peasant's door, and saw his child Neglect its fitting toys to march in mimic war, Shouldering his father's sword—a rough tool, methought For infant hands to grasp. Wal. This new oppression Doth outstrip the wind. Confederates. What's that you speak of? Arn. The Convent of St. Dominic at Endelberg Has been broke open—the holy vessel's stolen— The refectory strew'd with remnants of a feast— The image of the blessed mother torn From its pedestal, and strewn in fragments O'er the sacred floor; a soldier's belt, Mark'd with the symbol of the state, was left; Yet will our honest rulers see not this, But stamp the ignominy of this deed On us! Nay, more—they did not dare refuse To make the holy father's reparation; But to meet the charge, an edict is put forth, Compelling all to labour for the State One day in seven, or redeem their absence By payment of a tax. To-morrow is the day Appointed for the trial of this trick— They'll find more labourers than they wot of For the State's good. We only wanted this, Or some such grievance to decide the act That should redeem us. Mar. Then it is welcome, Since 'twill mould to good. Arn. To-night will prove it. [Dead march.] For I have brought two pleaders in our cause, Who with their wordless eloquence shall shake Their very souls! Look! look, my friends! is freedom but a shade, When at her call a thousand hearts are found Piled on her altar stone, though death stands by? Death bears nature's seal, but slavery Is most unnatural, or God would ne'er Have equaliz'd man's power with man's so finely. It was a demon's thought that first conceived it For bad men's purposes! 'Twas nurtured on the ill And damning passions of our nature 'till it grew So monstrous on its appetites, the world Itself could scarce allay them. Wal. It feeds not here While we have hearts and hands to drive it hence. [The Peasantry appear again and descend on the Stage, and form at back.] Arn. (Advances to bier.) Mountaineers! the hour has arrived when hearts Must prove the stuff they're made of. Here, my friends, are two I have wept over, A sire and a child; draw near and gaze on them! See, how fair she was; worthy the parent stem She sprung from! One blow killed both! one blow! [To a Peasant.] You weep, old man? Does she resemble your own Sweet child? Be wary of her! The bow that shot This shaft has yet another resting on the string With the same power to bend it, and the will! 'Twas done for pastime by our rulers, sirs! Nay, by an old man's word, I swear 'twas so! It pleased them; she was fair; they pluck'd the bud, And so it withered! The old man died from grief. Omnes. Tyrants! Arn. The dead do stir ye, then! I'm glad of it; For tyranny could not. For years the chain Hath rusted with your blood, distill'd by drops, Which had ye freely pour'd had eat it through. My countrymen! Oppression's at its height! Switzerland's a name alone, and that of scorn. Her ancient laws usurp'd; her fruitfulness Converted to the means of her destruction! Her rulers aliens, and her children slaves! What's to be done? the forest oak's unscath'd By summer winds. The wedge alone divides it. Our entreaties fall upon our ruler's hearts As dew on adamant—the sword alone Can reach them. How speaks Helvetia's children To Helvetia's question? Will ye strike for freedom? Omnes. We will; we will! Arn. Swear with me here, that whilst a vein contains Its flood of life, to struggle in this cause! Spread out your hands to the broad sky o'er us, That heaven may see they're stainless yet with blood— That that which shall hereafter redden them Will be from the oblations to our country. Omnes. (Kneeling.) We swear! [They all rise.] Alb. (To Arnold.) My more than father—for you have given me A title to the freedom of these hills— A hundred brothers in these noble men— A right to wield a sword in this just cause— Here in thy hands I place the price another sold His freedom for! use it to aid the gaining of our own. [Gives a purse. Arn. You hear him, friends; he nobly gives you gold! Speak, do the swords ye bring require a purchase? Omnes. No! no! we strike for liberty! Arn. Albert, you hear their answer! what would tyrants give For hands so fill'd? their gold could never buy them! Alb. Oh, noble hearts! worthy the glorious land That heaven hath given you! Arn. William! my boy! Hast thou no words? Wil. (Points to the bier.) Here is my eloquence, In the pale face of this sleeping angel! The spirit that inhabited this form Is now her country's advocate in heaven. Wal. See, Arnold, our messenger from Berne returns— Heaven send they're with us! This speed looks well. Enter a Peasant. Arn. How answers Berne? Peasant. As you divined— They said their answer was already given. Arn. So much the better! the glory will be greater, Peasant. Orders have been given to one Of Rudolph's messengers to speed unto the hills With letters to Lord Gesler, the bitterest foe Our country numbers. Arn. Too well I know it. [To Peasant.] We must to action, then! Fire the beacon! [William ascends the rock. And may our sacrifice find favour, heaven! [The glare of the Beacon falls on the Stage, and other fires appear successively on the distant hills.] Behold their ready answer! [A horn is sounded at a distance, answered until end of Act.] Another, too! Unsheath your swords, and boldly to the question, And think upon the glorious prize ye fight for! Freedom to Helvetia! [Omnes shout.—Picture.] END OF ACT IV.</field>

(Throwing the dice box down.) Deuce ace! Fortune's against me still! Ges. Fortune's a woman, and 'tis e'er her art To thwart her woers wishes for a while To pay him all at once, the bliss he asks. Tempt her once more, my lord! Here are the dice! Rud. Well then, for fifty pieces! [Throws.] Eleven! Ges. Said I not rightly? the maid becomes less coy [Throws.] Eight! the stake is yours! Wilt tempt her smile again? Rud. Aye, will I Gesler! But fill, sirs; fill a pledge To madam fortune! She is the soldier's mistress And should be greeted with a brimming cup. [They fill.] To the blind goddess “Fortune.” Omnes. [Drink.] To fortune. Raz. This smacks of life cousin! give me the camp With all its sweet uncertainties! The doubt That mingles with each draught we drain, whether we Quaff another ere we die, gives a zest That keeps satiety a stranger to our revels. Rud. (Who has thrown and again won.) Comrades! another to our lady-love! If she wants eyes, her ears are not o'er dull; She answers to our pledge in shining gold, Scarce duller than our wine. Again! Omnes. To fortune. Enter Hertman, L. H. Hert. My lord, the rebels are assembling fast, And in great numbers. Beacon's are pil'd Upon the hills in readiness to tell The signal for assault. Our scouts report 'Twere easy to surprise them, ere they form; And to secure a speedy and certain victory. Rud. Nay, nay, the game shall rise, ere we unstrike Unhooding the Falcon preparatory to flight. Our falcons. 'Tis your throw Gesler. Raz. Our cousin has studying 'mong frog's; He croaks so well. [Observing Rudolph.] Ha, ha! another lucky cast! The gold imparts its shunshine to his face. Hert. The beacon's on the hills are fired my lord; Their wreathy smoke is circling to the skies On every side. Rud. No matter Hertman, So that it does not hide the sun's broad light! he throws against me Gesler. Hert. (Aside. He tempts his fate; The game we play grows hazardous! my lord, Each minute adds new courage to the foe! Ges. You win, my lord. Raz. How like a rusty bell Our cousin has become, which harshly creaks With every passing wind, but cannot raise A sound beyond the music that the owl Delights in for her lullaby! Enter Soldiers, bringing in Gortz, L. H. Soldier. This peasant Was found lurking about our camp, my lord. Rud. Look to him Hertman. Seven! Hert. Madman! [To Gortz.] Well, sirrah, thou'rt a spy? Gortz. Marry, not I sir; I am a loyal servant to the state, As cousin Peter there can testify. [Points to Razman.] Raz. I your cousin? Hertman I know him not. Gortz. Oh, Peter! Peter! Art thou grown so great That thou forget'st thy kindred? Fie Peter, fie! It was to seek thee out, I hither came. Raz. (L. C.) My lord I know him not. [To Rudolph.] My lord he is a spy! Rud. (R. H.) Hang him then. The throw's with you. Gortz. (Crossing to C.) My lord! my lord! for cousin Peter's sake, I prithee hang me not! let me go free. I'm but a simple lad, a poor minstrel, And no spy. I'll guide your troops my lord, by ways You have no mind of—oh, anything but hang [To Hertman.) You know me, sir, I am he whose wit you question'd Upon old Eberhard's daughter's wedding day, She's dead, sir. 'Twas that which roused the people. You see I'm honest: for I blink not aught I've knowledge of good, sirs. [Rudolph throws down the box and advances.] Rud. He is not worth The very hangman's pains: a rope were wasted On a thing like him. Gortz. Oh blessings on thy wit That can discern the worth of nothingness. Rud. How many do the rebels number? Gortz. As near as may be, about a thousand men, And those half dead with fear. They fight my lord? Some score or two of men with me to lead them— I mean as guide. Rud. We'll take the field on foot. To arms!

Arn. Not one, not one! I've look'd among ye for A quailing eye, and find it not. 'Tis well! The victory's half achiev'd, when the results not feared! (He advances to one.) Lend me thy buckler. I've heard thy grandsire say He bore it at Mortgartem. That was a day Will live in Switzerland's annals till her hills Are levell'd with the plain. See how many a blow This trusty friend hath borne, and yet thy grandsire Liv'd to tell the part he bore in that great day! Bring thou it back but with as many records Of thy valour, thy country will not be A niggard of her thanks. (To William.) Come here my boy. [Draws.] This was my father's sword. Thou see'st how closely It hath question'd and been answer'd. Thy sinews Are more firm than those of my old arm, I would not have it handless, give me thine. (They exchange swords.) Wil. I take it father, and you shall find it with me, When you require it back again, and sheathless As you give it me. I owe our foes a debt Which in its payment may this lustre dim, But shall not stain it. I thank thee for the gift! [A parly sounded.] Arn. Hark! hark! they mock us even in the field For now their war trumps sound the notes of peace. Enter Gesler, L. H. Whom seek you sir? Ges. Arnold of Winkelried! Arn. Your search is ended, sir, for I am he. What is the purport of your message? Ges. Peace! Arn. Most welcome is it if to justice join'd. Speak on sir. Ges. Count Rudolph greets ye all And will forego his much provok'd resentment If now ye quit your hostile bearing. Arn. What if we refuse? Ges. The worst the law may warrant. Arn. We understand you, sir, the fire which kindles The rooftree of one home will light up hundreds, The sword which reeks in slaughter of one Swiss Will cleanse its crimsomed surface in another. Said I not rightly? Ges. You do sir. Arn. What say ye friends? Surrender leaves us where the morning found us The serfs of strangers, nay, the worst of slaves. To sail in this our enterprize will bring Death in exchange for abject servitude. To struggle and to conquer leaves us free! Which is your choice? Omnes. (R. H.) Death or freedom! Arn. (C.) You are answered, sir. Ges. (L. H.) Your pardon, sir, a more defined reply Is needed to my lord's proposal. Arn. (To one of the Peasants.) Give me an arrow, one that is sure of flight. (Aside to him) Speed you to Martin bid him without delay Bring up his friends. [Aloud.] I do not like your shafts. [Exit Peasant, R. H. (To another.) Pray you show me yours. [Aside.] Find Walter of Uri Tell him what you've observed. [Exit Peasant—Aloud.] This will do. [Takes an Arrow.] (Aside to him.) Speed as you've hopes of life, we meet them at the dawn. [Exit Peasant R. H. Ges. I wait your answer, sir. Arn. I'll task your patience But a little longer. [To William.] Give me your bow [Aside to him.] Conceal your force behind the mountain— We'll drive the Austrians towards the close defile— Away, and shun observance. [To Gesler.] I claim your notice, sir. [Suiting the action to the word.] The knock's on the string—the bow is bent— The arrow's gone—'till now—the impulse spent Which gave it motion—it falls to earth! Such is the answer we to Rodolph send. The will which guides our actions had its rest Upon our heartstrings. It hath begun its course, And as the arrow cannot be recall'd, When once it hath commenc'd its airy flight, Our purpose changes not—we die or conquer. Ges. Pause, ere you dismiss me; our numbers double yours, Train'd to the ways of war, and arm'd as soldiers Who have the keeping of a nation's glory. Arn. Were they ten times doubled we should reply the same, For though our ranks are fill'd by husbandmen, We have a cause which gives each lowly heart The aspirations of a hero's soul— A cause which justice sanctions and supports. Ges. Then be it so. I bid you now farewell, With the assurance we shall meet again Where blows will serve for language. Arn. Farewell, sir. [Exit Gesler, L. H. The sun! the sun is rising! Let its set Find us more worthy of its glorious light. Forth every sword! [All draw.] See how they catch the beams As though to light us to our blessed toil. Away with every thought but that of victory! Let your loud halloo serve the trumpet's voice! Huzza for Switzerland, the land we love! [Drums, Shouting, &amp;c. Exeunt omnes, R. H. SCENE III. —The Mountains. Alarom. Drums, Trumpets, &amp;c. Enter William and Hertman, U. E. R. H. fighting. Hert. Spare my life, and I will give you gold More than my armour weighs. Wil, I prize thy word As highly as thy gold, and both at nothing. Hert. I pledge it by honour! My name is Hertman! Wil. Hertman! Devil! I would not sell Thy life, if every drop thy blacken'd heart gives out Were by a ruby, priceless as the sun, To be redeemed! My wife! my wife was priceless. [They fight off, R. H. Drums and Trumpets. Enter Bertha, 3 E. L. H. watching the conflict. Ber. Brave hearts! brave hearts! how breathlessly they move, And yet how firmly. That is my father's form Hurrying thus to and fro! Now they pause! [A shout.] That was a noisy greeting, well answer'd By a cloud of arrows. Brave hearts, 'tis vain! They rattle on their steel but do not scathe— The iron forest moves towards them—they close! Oh God! how fast they fall! Mercy! they fly! Oh, that I were a man to shame them! 'Tis well! My father strikes the foremost recreant down, But they press by him. In vain he strives to stay Their flight—they bear him onward with them! I know his mighty heart is now nigh bursting. They are not worthy freedom who could fly So soon before their enslavers! [Shouts and drum.] [Exit behind the rock, U. E. L. H. Enter Arnold, 3 E. L. H. forced on by Peasantry. His sword broken. Arn. Oh, miserable show of manhood! Fly on, But herd not more with men! Go seek the hare And chamois they are most fit to be your comrades! What has so scar'd ye? Ye'd wear the iron Of their weapons were it beat into an edgeless chain, But dare not face them now, lest ye should bleed! Mar. We fear not equal conflict, but their spears Are charmed—we cannot beat them down. Arn. Methinks if they were straws and tipp'd with pins, So that they drew blood, ye dare not face them! [Trumpet.] Oh, look ye look ye! from what things ye fly! A troop of women! for the little mound They've climb'd hath well nigh drain'd them of their breath, And yet these pamper'd things have power to scare Helvetia's sons from Freedom's glorious feast! Wal. Arnold, beat down their spears, and we will earn More of your praise than now we have your censure! Arn. Ye fear their spears! Beheld, I am unarm'd, And yet all naked as I am, I will not move One backward step from where I take my stand! Our word be “Onward!” Let the dastard fly— Not to his home, for that will be accurs'd— Not to the hills, for they are for the free— Not to our plains, for where his foot doth fall The grass will wither ne'er to spring again— But to the desert, where nothing of life Is found to hold communion with the slave! [Drums and Trumpets. They come! now let them find a foeman's greeting— The rude embrace of undissembling hate! [The Austrians enter R. H. in compact order, led by Hertman and Rudolph. The Swiss shout and advance cautiously towards them, Arnold encouraging them by his gestures. He rushes towards the Austrians, and spreading out his arms, seizes a number of their Spears and falls upon their points, exclaiming, “Charge, for Helvetia! charge!” The Peasants rush through the openings thus made, and at length force the enemy off. Arnold is discovered supported in the centre of the Stage.] Enter Bertha, U. E. L. H. Ber. My father! [Runs to him.] Arn. This is no time for tears! Pray, Bertha! pray my death be not in vain! Ber. Death! no, no! thou art not dying, father! There is no prize that is worth half the ransom. Arn. Yes! yes! a fellow's freedom! Give me thine hand. I've won to-day the best of requiems— The good man's praise! Enter Martin, R. H. [To Martin.] How speed's the day? Mar. Well, good Arnold! for when I left the field The knights were turning from our friends. Arn. Then, God, I thank thee, and but ask for life To hear the cause has triumph'd! Enter Albert, with the Standard of Austria, Peasantry shouting, bringing in Rudolph and others wounded. My pray'r is answer'd! [To Rud.] You see how calmly an old man can die, When 'tis for liberty! Friends, let this day Be memorial in your hearts; that should a tyrant Again attempt to chain ye, ye may know The way to check his power! Tell! I come! [Chorus repeated very piano. The Curtain descends.</field>
