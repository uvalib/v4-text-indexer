      <field name="fulltext">ARIADNE: OR, THE Triumph of BACCHUS. AN OPERA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. MEN. Bacchus. Theseus, Prince of Athens. Pirithous, Prince of the Lapithes, his Friend. Abdalla, An Indian King, whom Bacchus conquer'd there, and afterwards, for Wit and good Humour, made his Favourite. Berontus, A Scythian Prince, of a Saturnine Humour; an Enemy to Love, and a Disliker of Bacchus, but Friend to Theseus, at last in Love with Celania. Bombey. A foolish Satyr. CHORUS of Bacchinals, MÃ¦nades, Indians and Satyrs. WOMEN. Ariadne, Daughter of King Minos of Crete. Cellania, Her Favourite, very Satyrical on Mankind. Doppa, A brisk humorous Girl, waiting on Ariadne. Shepherds, Shepherdesses, Clowns, Singers, and Dancers. The Scene NAXOS, an Island in the Archipelago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Argument of the OPERA. Theseus, Prince of Athens, having conquer'd the Minotaur, and by the Means of Ariadne, Daughter to King Minos, who fell in Love with him, escap'd out of the Labyrinth, brings her along with him to Naxos, she hoping he would marry her, as he had promis'd, before his coming away; tho' at that instant he design'd otherwise, having resolv'd an Expedition to OEbalia to steal away Helena, Daughter to King Tindarus, whom he was in Love with; they arrive at Naxos, where Bacchus is newly come from the Conquest of the Indians, bringing with him Abdalla, and other Indian Kings, Captive; and where he also meets his dear Friend Theseus, accompany'd by Pirithous and Berontus, a Prince of Scythia. Bacchus at Sight of Ariadne falls in Love with her, which Theseus favours, gaining thereby a Pretext of leaving her so well to her Advantage, and furthering his own Pursuit of Helen. This is plotted and done at the Triumph of Bacchus, where Ariadne and her Favourite Cellania, coming to see it, Theseus is miss'd, being gone with Pirithous, Berontus remaining, who is newly fal'n in Love with Cellania; Ariadne rages, weeps, and is in great Distress for some time; but Bacchus appearing with his Glory and Courtship, especially presenting her a Crown, to be made a Constellation, and a Promise of deifying her, her Tears are afterwards turn'd to Joy, and the Marriage with great Solemnity being perform'd, finishes the Opera.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. In a pleasant champion Country, where at a little distance, through Vineyards and flowry Gardens, is seen the beautiful Palace of Bacchus; are also seen four rich Pavilions, between which, in the Front, is erected a Trophy of the slain, Minotaur Guards all along on both sides attending. Theseus, Pirithous, Berontus appear. Thes. Bright Fame and Beauty should Reward the Warrior Who bravely to obtain 'em baffles Danger, A Thought so ravishing inspires my Fancy. Changing to an Air. Soul of the World, whose charming Grace Illustrates more than Titan's Race: Oh Glory! thou still charm'st the Mind, And mak'st the happy Hero find A Rapture in the World below, Which scarce cÃ¦lestial Seraphs know. Soul of the World, &amp;c. Pirith. The dreadful Minotaur is nobly conquer'd, And all th'Athenian victim Youths reliev'd. Thes. But ah! the beauteous Hellen lives a Virgin, Sad in her Prime, and drooping in OEbalia; Whose rare uncommon Beauty has inflam'd me To fierce Desire, and highest Blaze of Passion. Oh Beauty all inspiring! Thou kill'st me with admiring; And yet whilst so I'm dying Methinks I'm Heaven enjoying. If as the lucky Warrior's Fee, Thou ever gratefully wer't paid, Extend thy Bounty now to me In that angelick charming Maid. Oh Beauty, &amp;c. Beron. Fame of your Actions from my Country drew me, But still my Heart with native Ice is freezing, Which still controuls the scorching Blaze you mention. Pirith. Oh most renown'd of lovely Women! How much she glory in her Fortune, Whom mighty Theseus designs to honour? But oh the Fate of Ariadne! Thes. Is happy as the Gods could order; For tho' she follows me to Naxos, And gave me proof of ardent Passion, By kindly guiding thro' the Labyrinth, My Feet unus'd to such MÃ¦anders; Yet leaving her to sacred Bacchus, Whose Love intends to deifie her, My Infidelity turns Favour, And justifies my Flight to Hellen. Beron. Oh how my Gall o'erflows! [Aside. I now am bursting The Spleen and crowding Vapours will consume me. Pirith. Ye Powers that sway the Mind, what nice Occasion Can on the sudden raise such strange Disorder! Beron. Excuse, oh Princes! Scythians all to Bacchus Bear a long dated and severe Aversion; Nor are we thought to do it without Reason. Air. Happy's the Nation by a Prince, Who with sound Reason sways, and Sense; But most forlorn, by one that rules, And makes 'em Madmen all, and Fools. Happy's the, &amp;c. Thes. From India lately he return'd with Conquest, And for that fam'd and glorious Expedition, Is here at Naxos with a Triumph honour'd. Pirith. Strong Passion every Hour inflames him, Which Ariadne more advances, Whilst you by Art of fine Dissembling Feed her with Smiles the Hour you leave her. They were created to deceive, Like Measure then they ought to have; Women are wav'ring as the Wind, And therefore should be paid in kind; Like Measure always let 'em have, They were created to deceive. They were created, &amp;c. Drums and Trumpets are heard, and shouts of Joy within. Beron. The God appears wanton and rosie, And I, and my Dislike, must shun him. [Exit. Beron. Enter Bacchus and Abdalla, with a Train of Indians and Bacchinals. Bac. How gay is infant Bloom of young Desire, When Morning comes, to sweeten the Debauches With which Saturnia and the Grape has blest us. Thes. Love fills the Scenes with cÃ¦lestial Gladness. Pirith. Hope too has always something new and pleasing. Abdal. And sprightly Wine to both, gives large Additions. Air. Whenever I'm sad my three Bottles I drink, For the more I am Toping the less still I Think. Vexation and Cares About worldly Affairs, Some national Strife, A new Plot, or a Wife, Oft puzzle the Poll, And teaze a Man's Soul; But Wine still relieves, and a good hearty Dose Gives a welcome Repose, And makes him be merry, would else be morose. Pirith. How free from Melancholly are the Natives In India, where hot PhÅbus shews his Power; This happy Prince is still to Care a Stranger. Thes. His conquer'd Country gives no sad Reflection, The Joy he finds in following LinÃ¦us Controuls all ill Effects of wav'ring Fortune. Bacch. His Mirth affords my Hours perpetual Solace! But oh, my Friend! how trifling is such Pleasure Compar'd to the sweet Smiles of Ariadne? Hast thou resolv'd, thou most Divine of Humanes, To keep thy Word, and with unequal Kindness Dole me a Joy by leaving her behind thee. Excelling what I share in being Immortal? Thes. Down in a Citron Grove, where gentle Breezes From Indian Jessamine, Assyrian Roses, Improv'd by Eglantine, and luscious Orange Increase the Od'rous Breath of fragrant Zephire; The charming Maid now lonely lies expecting My Morning Visit, there I'll straight accost her With Tidings of the Triumph's gay Performance, And your cÃ¦lestial Faculties, e'er Vesper Adorns the Evening's Gloom.âShe's yours. Bacch. Embrace me, And share my Bosom from this happy Moment; Cleave to my Heartâthence to my Bower of Pleasure. Pirith. Where in full Bowls, perfum'd with mingling Amber, We'll make Oblation to bright Paphian Venus, And there implore her Aid. Abdall. Attending Cupids To toast their Mother, will be hovering round ye. Bacchus and Theseus. Of all Joys were e'er possest, Air. Love and Wine are still the best. Sweetly they by turns controul, Wine the Heart, and Love the Soul; Wealth and Power strive in vain Equal Happiness to gain; Wine superior Joy do's prove, And in sober SeasonsâLove. Of all Joys, &amp;c. [Exeunt embracing. SCENE II. Enter Ariadne and Cellania, Doppa waiting. Ariad. Again, sweet Philomel, that warbling Cadence Think not on Tereus now, lost be the Story; The baleful Crimes of Rape and odious Falshood, With which Mankind by ours are daily branded, No more be mentioned for the sake of Theseus. Cell. Fondly you may believe, but oh! be certain, The Brave are not confirm'd to be most constant. Air. Winter's Ice producing Roses, Balmy Rest from poyson'd Doses; Without Lightning to hear the Thunder, Constant Man is more a Wonder. Winters Ice, &amp;c. Ariad. Some strong Disgust, Cellania has inflam'd thee; Fell Disappointment rouzing Female Anger, Or slighted Passion, gives thee cause of Railing, But happy I have Quiet in my Bosom. Air. Like a heavenly Seraph blest, is that cÃ¦lestial Maid, Who by Parents ne'er was crost, nor by her Love betray'd; Who secur'd by Innocence against Misfortunes Spight, Wears the Day unpain'd by Care, and sweetly too the Night. Fortify'd by Providence, can with ill Stars contend, And tho' Time be her greatest Foe, is us'd still like a Friend. Like a heavenly, &amp;c. Enter Theseus, with Bombey and Tracis. Thes. Flora, the Queen of vernal Grace, All the delightful Plants and Flowers, From Ariadne take their Odours. Ariad. Theseus with his Mercurian Genius, Each Female fair can make a Goddess. Cell. He can like all his Kind dissemble, And if we will be Fools we may be. Thes. Sweet Seraph cease, for vain you make me, And now to lead bright Ariadne, From this her Bower of Contemplation; I come to wait her to the Palace, Where she'll in Triumph see great Bacchus, Joy of all Hearts, Theam of all Voices, The Soul of all that's brave and noble, Appear in Pomp. Ariad. All Pomp is Folly; Theseus is all my Eyes do covet, And all that gives my Thoughts Employment. Thes. Too highly, charming fair, you treat me, Now to shew Man in his wild Nature, [Aside. I'll veil resolv'd Inconstancy With seeming Passion, nothing else can blind her. Ariad. Theseusâ [Passionately.] Thes. What would my Soul? Ariad. Inchanting Theseus. Thes. Heavenly Ariadne. [Both joyning Hands. Celan. Like two fine Instruments that form a Consort, They're now well tun'd, but will it last, I wonder? [Apart. Ariad. With what auspicious Beams shone radiant PhÅbus, When I beheld thee first? Thes. That happy Night too, When Cinthia silver'd with uncommon Brightness, Adorn'd my fairest in the Labyrinth. Ariad. Venusâapprov'd the dear Design. Thes. And Love's kind Deity, Made sharp his Golden Darts, I was first wounded! Ariad. Ah no. Thes. Yes, yes. Ariad. No, no. Thes. Yes, yes. Ariad. Oh Theseus! I, I, was wounded first, and deepest! My Heart leapt up to meet the Stroke. Thes. EliziumâBreaths in thy Words. Ariad. For so much Worth too little Transcendent Merit has ingag'd my Heart, Thou'rt all in all, and all in every Part. Thes. Thou'rt all in all, &amp;c. Valour join'd with Wit inspiring, Womens Hearts are always firing; Fools that oft' are Undertakers, Wanting Merit, bart'ring Acres; For Convenience gain Admission, But have never true Possession: They're each other still defeating, 'Tis on both sides only cheating. Valour join'd, &amp;c. Thes. How charming from the Fair are Praises? Inspire me, Love, to make an Answer! I'm yours whilst Time has Date,âOh Mercury! Favour this Lye I'm blest. [Aside. Cellan. Here's Words sufficient. Thes. Come away sweet Charmer. Cellan. But oh! the Heart, the Heart, Words are but Vapours. Thes. Come to the Triumph. Ariad. I am all Obedience. Air by Bacchus and Ariadne. Dazling Pomp, and awful State, Suit the Hero brave and great, Love in brilliant Beauty set, Making it still more transcending. Glory charms the Warriour's Mind, If the Fair one too prove kind, No Contentment's left behind, Worth enjoying or commending. [Exeunt he leading her. Bombey and Doppa stay; he having long been making Grimaces behind, comes forward and Sings. Bomb. E'er since our PhÅbus fond of Rest, Last Night, made more than wonted haste, To bath with Thetis in the West, I've had strange Qualms within my Breast. Doppa with fine black rowling Eyes, Has made poor Bombey's Heart her Prize; Be kind then dearest of all Dears, For I'm in Love up to the Ears. Doppa. If Bombey loves, he must prepare, To clip his Horns, and shave his Hair; Instead of causing Love, they scare. The Hoofs too hid within his Shoes, In Bed a tender Maid will bruise. They must be par'd. Bomb. With all my Heart; Nor will I cry Oh, at the Smart. Doppa. Why then, because you Woodland Satyrs, Are not well skill'd in Courtly Matters; Besides, to prove I'm tender hearted, I'll shew ye how to dress and please me. Bomb. Oh, how my Heart jumps within me! But what can change this Hair so matted? Doppa. A flaxen Peruke finely powder'd. Bomb. But then my Face, so red and tawny. Doppa. It must be flead with boiling Water. Bomb. Odzooks 'twill scald. Doppa. OhâThat's no Matter. You without Prickles can't have Roses, Nor be a Beau without some Trouble. Air. Our Sex are all refin'd, and now There's nothing like a Modern Beau, To lisp, and play well with a Fan, Be more a Monkey than a Man; A quart of Jelly drink with Ice, And eat what's only dear and nice; Forget to think, and hate to read This, this is he,âthat will succeed. Our Sex are all, &amp;c. Bomb. For love of thee I'll be this Creature, But in what Habit must I case me, That this unseemly Hump may cover. Doppa. A fine lac'd Coat best Suits a Lover, A Hat cockt up with Golden Button, Form'd like a Minc'd Pie with three Corners; 'Tis all the Mode. Bomb. Hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh! Are these the Charms so fast can fetter? Why as I am, I'm sureâmuch better. Aire. My Back is broad, I'm hot and young, And shaggy Hair's a sign I'm strong; Then I can climb the lofty Pine, And Rape the tow'ring Eagle's Nest; Or oft with curious Fly and Line, Beguile the Trout, to make a Feast. Then hunt the Stag, and snare the Fawns, And like a Roe skip o'er the Lawns. My Back is broad, &amp;c. Doppa. This won't do, this cannot take me; And so farewel. Bomb. Oh,âdon't forsake me! Doppa. Obey, and dress then if you love me, For nothing but a Beau can move. Second Movement. Bomb. Then take me, and model me just to thy Mind, Since Beauty much stronger than Reason can bind, I'll once be a Coxcomb! Doppa. Why then I'll be kind. Bomb. Whatever Distinction in Breeding may be, When a Female's i'th' Case, Every Male is an Ass; And the Man and the Satyr agree. Both. Whatever Distinction, &amp;c. [Exeunt. The End of the First.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. In which appears the Triumph of Bacchus, he himself sitting in a Triumphal Chariot drawn by Lynxes, surrounded by Theseus, Pirithous, Abdalla, &amp;c. Ariadne seated in State as Spectator, Cellania by her, Indian Princes, and other Slaves chain'd; Attendants on all Sides, with Bombey and Doppa: A Dance also perform'd, Singing and Musick. Bacchus descends from the Chariot, and Ariadne from her Place, he meets her in the Front of the Stage, and sings. Bach. Not awful Jove, from PhlÃ¦gras War returning, Where the Gigantick Sons of Earth lay bleeding, When, tho' CÃ¦lestial Beauty's crown'd with Glory, All met the Conqueror in bright Procession: Gave half the Splendor Ariadne brings me, Divinest Fair. [Taking her Hand. Ariad. Hail to the great Immortal, [Offers to kneel, he hinders her. The Cheerer of all Hearts, blest Source of Pleasure. Thes. Patron of Joy, and Life's continual Comfort, Long dold to Humanes, with a Grace transporting. Pirith. Great Bacchus whom the World with Joy confesses Bounteous as our Olimpicus Almighty. Abdal. When all with Zeal and perfect Adoration, Extol the Raiser of their high Contentment. Ariad. Once more great Victor hailâ Bacch. Oh Sovereign Beauty! How Joyful, and how charming are thy Praises. Celan. This seems a Riddle, in each moving Accent; Appears methinks the Language of a Lover, [Aside. The Gods I see too can like Mortals flatter. Bacch. And now let us retire from Ceremony, To Feasting, and the Sports that are preparing, Where tho' the Soul of Musick strive to treat us, Compar'd to Sounds you breath 'twill all be Discord. Air. How sweetly the Rapture does move, When the fair one declares she can love, The Harmony comes from the Spheres, 'Tis told us can ravish our Ears; The Muses employ'd in their Quire, With Pleasure the Senses can fire: But ah, what a Trifle is this? When compar'd to the extasied Bliss? That Beauty when pleas'd, can inspire. How sweetly the Rapture, &amp;c. [Bacchus leads her off, and Abdalla [Celania, the Scene shuts. Manent Theseus and Pirithous. Thes. Oh Heaven! how fine a thing is Woman? When Love and kind Desire unite us. And favour the belov'd Enjoying; But Oh, how pal'd is sickly Fancy! When fondly undesir'd they teize us, And we've a Passion for another; She's gone, Pirithous, the poor Turtle Must change her Mate, and coo without me. Pirith. Then let her go, 'tis decent Justice, That sometimes Womankind should punish; They should be plagu'd when we're inconstant, For their Original deceiving. Thes. But is Berontus our wild Scythian, That bore 'gainst Love and Wine such Hatred, So strangely caught, as late 'tis rumour'd, To languish and adore Cellania. Pirith. He sighs like any Village Virgin, That first looks pale for her Philander, Then leaves her Food,âbehold him coming! He'll stay behind, and will be useful, When we to other Shores are wasted, To send us News of Ariadne. [Enter Berontus. Ber. What Devil is brooding here these forty Winters? Braving the Tempests of the stormy Boreas, And all the Plagues that ruffle human Quiet; I've had the Halcyons Nest within my Bosom: But since I saw this Woman I'm infected, I burn, I freeze, a Mutiny's within me. Thes. We'll take no notice of his wild Disorder. Pirith. Now Prince of Scythia, you have shun'd the Triumph, Some other matters have been more diverting. Ber. Diversion ceases now, to crown the Banquet, Theseus is wanting, and, as Spies inform'd me, The lovely Princess, broke from her Regalia Through all the Sports, to charge the fair Cellania To seek her Lord, and know his cause of Absence; She's coming this way. Thes. But must fail to find us, For our embarking this must be the Moment. Pirith. You, Prince, have Business here to stay behind us, You will be fit to break this anxious Matter; A small Elopement, 'tis but nine Days Wonder. Air. To rowling, rowling Seas we go, Where Mountain Billows foam and flow; Safe o'er the watry World we'll glide, Defying Tempests and the Tide. Laugh at the tumbling Porpuss there, And sing be Welkin fowl or fair; Rockt in a Storm, securely sleep, And dream of Wonders in the Deep. To rowling, &amp;c. Thes. When Love's the Pilot, happy is the Sailing, Green bearded Palemon will form a Consort, And loud with quavering Sounds on shelly Hautboys, Tritons shall sing and pipe to entertain us. To the Gods of the Ocean I pray, To waft us soon over the Sea; Oh Love lend a Sigh to our Sail! If Zephire deny us a Gale, To land us upon the kind Shoar, Made blest by the Nymph I adore; Where Beauty with Pleasure prepar'd, May Toils of a Lover reward. Theseus and Pirithous. To the Gods of the Ocean, &amp;c. [Exeunt. Thes. and Pirith. Manet Berontus. Ber. My Sickness of the Mind they both discover; Let it be so, I'm chain'd and must endure it; This Royal Fugitive may aid my Passion, Whilst I inform Cellania I am constant, Tho' others are so falseâand see she's coming, Flushing, and fierce like Woman when she's angry. Enter Cellania hastily. Cellan. If Fame to this Moment always was counted a Liar, The noisy Tongue Member ever too plagu'd with a Blister, Now be it authentick. Cell. Can Theseus leave Ariadne? Be PhÅbus extinguisht, fall ev'ry Star from the Zodiack, Imprison the Lightning, yet 'twill be far less a Wonder. Ber. I'll shew ye a greater! Cell. That must be worthy admiring. Ber. I love fair Cellania. Cell. Gods! is this Season for Fooling. What say ye of Theseus?âJove, and ye Powers avenging? Where now is the Thunder? Ber. Theseus o'th' East is known a Native; We, where the Snow falls are more steady, Have Constancy cooler. Cell. Why tell you me of your Temper, [Raging. Burn fierce as Avernus, freeze more than Icy Cocytus, So Theseus returning, cheer the forlorn Ariadne, I still shall be easy. Ber. See yonder is the Vessel Sailing: [Points to a Window. Sweet Charmer, have Patience! Cell. Patience!âOh Mulciber! raging Bring Fire consuming, or thou more ruinous Ãther. Flash, burn and destroy 'em. [Stamping in rage. Kind Boreas, down with the Mainmast; And buried in Tempest, toss up their Keel to the Heavens. Ber. Tho' Passion's just, all are not Traytors, Berontus still is firm and constant, Averse to Love, till awful Beauty, Controul'd the Ascendant, now I languish, A Feaver reignsâI'm sick. Cell. Oh, would I were sure on't! Ber. Best Proof is in Action, try me, and weigh the Performance, His Crimes are so odious, they blast the Title of Hero, And warn'd by your Favours, I dare in Person avouch it. The Minotaurs Conquest joyn'd with Procrastus and Sciron, To me had been Trifles, Beauty like yours commanding, Oh favour my Wishes, and be for ever my Pallas: I love thee to Madness, die for the happy Possession, My Slumbers are broken, no Food can ever sustain me, Without my Cellania. Cell. 'Tis well: Oh how I rejoice in't! But are you in Earnest? Ber. Fervent! Cell. You'll wooe me like Theseus, Ber. I hate him and Bacchus. Cell. That, that's the Secret I long'd for; Oh Men! Oh ye Monsters! Oh horrid Race of Deceivers! But since you do love me, hear how I mean to return it. Air. Like Daphne, coy, I'll fly when you pursue, And all my injur'd Sex revenge on you; Whate'er you say, I'll turn to Ridicule, Whate'er you do, I'll use ye like a Fool; Whene'er you sigh, I'll shew Disdain and Spite, And if you shed a Tear, I'll laugh outright. Like Daphne, &amp;c. [Exit. Cellania. Ber. Perdition seize the Kindâmay never Woman Be henceforth Fair, may fowl Diseases plaguing, Blast all their BeautiesâAge creep on o'th' suddain, May Loathsome Jaundice curb their Pride inherent Till they cry out for Men, and Men thus use 'em; What's to be done? I love and yet I hate her; Oh that we were alone on Mount Citharon! Lofty Olympus, or the towring O Eta! I'd not thus whine and play the Fool by Venus. A gen'rous Rape's allow'd in other Creatures, And should be natural to Men no doubt on't. Air. In Love to use a little Force, Coy Silvia likes ye ne'er the worse, Females as soon as they can go, First learn the Words of ay and no. The no most useful still we find, To the Perverseness of the Kind; But as the Nurse compels the Child, That would do nought with usage mild. Rough Damon oft commands his Joy, And makes the froward Fair say ay. In Love to use, &amp;c. [Exit Beron. Enter Bacchus and Abdalla. Bacch. Wild as the Winds, as raging and impetuous, She ranges thro' th'Apartment.âOh Abdalla! How can a Lover look upon such Sorrow Without a share in't. Abd. You may take a share in't, But then make haste and do't on a sudden; For Women veer their Humours like the Weather, And now they rain, and straight they will be shining. Air. Their Grief is all Art, they have Tears so at will, Depend on't no Sorrow a Woman can kill. A jolly young Widow there liv'd at Bengall, Had twenty four Husbands, and bury'd 'em all; And when every wittal was sent to his Grave, Oh! how she would whimper, oh! how she would rave; But when a Successor did sprucely appear, Oh! how she would teehee, and simper, and sneer; The time was so swift 'twixt they come and they go, I'th' Morning she'd ha, ha, i'th' Evening cryâoh! Their Grief is all Art, &amp;c. Bacch. I'll change her Sorrow to delightful Pleasure, Work on her Mind with gentle moving Praise And Greatness, which all Womankind are fond of; Air. Applaud the Fair, and let her Sway, Then you'll find her pleas'd, and gay; Gold may charm her Understanding, Sometimes to incline her Love, But the pleasure of Commanding Still will never failing prove: Thus with subtle shew of Duty You may quench ye if ye burn, And when you enjoy their Beauty Know you govern in your Turn. Applaud the Fair, &amp;c. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Ariadne appears sitting on a Couch, weeping, and in a Rage. Cellania struggling gets a Dagger from her, she starts up and sings. Ariad. Will ye, oh! will ye then bereave me Of what can only end my Sorrow, If not the Dagger, give me Poyson, Let Cordial Aconite bring Solace. Oh! where's thy Asp, great Cleopatra, Or thy hot Coals, resolving Portia; One, one of these will ye not render, And pity so forlorn a Creature. Cell. That precious Life has yet in Vengeance Great things to do. Ariad. And I'll perform 'em. Air. [Distractedly raving. I now have God Neptune's whole Power, My Waves all Mankind shall devour; My Surges no more shall be bounded 'Till Nature be wholly confounded, And if to the Sky The Perjur'd can fly, I'll mount on my Billows and drown it. Cell. Oh! calm your Rage, recal your Senses, Men will be thus, 'tis second Nature. Ariad. My Brain's on Fire, [Raving still. and now I'm burning; My Breath's as hot as flaming Ã¦tna! Oh! could I blast this Male Deceiver, What Joy were like it? [She throws her self agen on the Couch, and weeps. Cell. Cool your Passion. Aire. Sorrow ne'er can mend the Matter, There's no changing human Nature; Men must deceive, We must believe; Then we give Rules, And they turn Fools; 'Tis Custom found, and Fate goes round. Sorrow ne'er, &amp;c. Enter Bacchus, Abdalla, with a Train of Indians and Bacchinals. Bacch. Immortal Charmer, for whom Heaven Gave him large Supplies to Goddess Nature, To Grace with more than common Beauty, Behold in me a perfect Lover, Pure without Dross of frail Deceiving; Drop then no more that pearly Treasure, But let gay Pleasure rare and brilliant Adorn my Fair. Cel. A Grief so weighty, Oppresses: oh! give time to alter. Bacch. The posting Hours shall wait her Leisure, The God of Time and I attending; Mean while prepare your Sports to cheer her, And turn to Pleasure hateful Mourning. Air. In chrystal Domes by Forms Divine possest, Fair Ariadne shall with me be blest; On Azure Plains we'll revel all the Day, Regal'd with Musick, and cÃ¦lestial Play; And whilst, like Gods, we Drink, and Sing, and Love, Forget the Cares below with Joys above. In chrystal Domes, &amp;c. Here follows a pleasant Entertainment of Dancing. Abdall. As Ariadne's Friend advise her, [Abdalla apart to Cellania. Such Lovers are not always coming; Besides, what's past there's no recalling, Let her not be too coy. [Bacchus this while sitting on the Couch seems courting Ariadne. Cell. I'm thinking, Yet if a God should take a Fancy, And should forswear himself as you do, 'Twere worth considering. Abdall. I'm as constant As Sol in India to his rising, Air. I never pretended to hang in my Garters, But once I did love a whole Hour and three Quarters. As black as a Crow, Round fac'd like a Sloe; With Teeth white as Snow Was Zara the Shrew; Who once held me fast, But I bilkt her at last. I never pretended, &amp;c. Cell. The Vice is rife in all Complexions, Black, Fair, or Brown, no Truth's in Colour. Ariad. Can Gods too condescend to flatter, [Ariadne rises from the Couch. And mention Joy to one so wretched? And one they made so. Oh! take Pity. [Weeps. Air. Where Sadness reigns, and Joy can never be, There let me hide my fatal Woes and me; In some lone Wood where Bears and Wolves we find, Remote from worser Brutes of Human Kind; Where dismal Ews keep out the cheerful Day, And baleful Screech Owls dream the Night away. Where Sadness reigns, &amp;c. [Exit Ariadne. Bacch. Oh! how will sprightly Mirth advance her Beauty, That in this Dress of Sorrow is so charming. Hear me, Cellania, hear to thy good Fortune, Follow that Fair one, use thy Skill to gain her; That once perform'd, as due Reward from Bacchus, Ask what thou wilt it shall be thine that Moment. Cell. Ye Pow'rs CÃ¦lestial, is my hearing perfect? If so, this Gift commands me swiftest Duty; Have what I please! Did Jove e'er give a greater? I'll straight about it, fear not, mighty Bacchus, Skill'd in both Arts, persuading and beguiling, The Turtle's Tears shall quickly turn to smiling. [Exit Cellania. Bacch. Next the extreme of Love's divine Possession, Hope is the greatest Joy attends a Lover. Abdall. The happy Prospect ravishing the Senses, Half equals the Delight of true Enjoyment. Bacch. Come then, my Friend, and whilst inspir'd Cellania Is busy in a Plot for Propagation, Within the hallow'd Cell of old Silenus, With Roses crown'd, we'll empty golden Goblets, A glorious Sanction to the genial Hour. Bacch. and Abdall. Haste, haste old Time away. And call the Hours to form the Nuptial Day; Let Juno come in State, Let kind Lucina wait; But bring not Venus there, She envies still the Fair; Nor yet the thund'ring Jove, For fear he falls in Love. Haste, haste, old Time, &amp;c. [Exeunt embracing. Enter Doppa hastily. Dopp. Where is my Fool, I must not lose him; For in this time of Melancholly He's good against the Spleen and Vapours. Oh! here he comes. Enter Bombey aukwardly Dress'd. Bom. My Pinkaninny. Am I not brave? Odzooks this Habit! Dopp. Methinks, he looks so like the perjur'd Theseus, That tho' I order'd ye to wear it, I wish that now 'twere torn in Tatters; For oh! I'm jealous that you, like him, Will be inconstant. Bom. I inconstant! What do's she mean? What's that, I wonder? To have the Itch? Dopp. Oh! no, an Ague, That shakes young Courtiers 'till they chatter. Bom. Oh! I'll be plagu'd with no such Matter; Air. I'll live still free, and frolick, And never get, if you'll be kind, A quaking Ague of the Mind, Nor give my Heart the Cholick; Each coming Night I'll kiss thee twice, The same on Mornings when I rise; And if thou likest such wholsom Cheer, I'll strive to hold out all the Year. I'll live still free, &amp;c. Dopp. This pleases, I confess. Bom. I hope so: If Brother Courtiers take Example, 'Twill be a merry World. Dopp. But Bombey. Bom. What? Dopp. Dear Bombey! Bom. Strawberry, more luscious than white Figs, what want'st thou? Dopp. One, one thing more, that Dress must alter, Methinks you now look like a Fool in't. Bom. 'Twill break me, I can't pay my Taylor. Dopp. He'll trust, at least will give Forbearance; Nay, never start, I'll have my Humour, Or else Adieu. Bom. This is the Devil! [Scratching and looking simply. Air. A Beau did once my Fancy move, But now a rural Swain I Love; It seems most German to my Heart, When you're uncas'd I shall be pleas'd, And then perhaps will act my Part; You'll be, young Damon, kind and dear, And I'll be Phillida the Fair. A Beau did once, &amp;c. Bom. Ah! sweet as Codlings Cream and Sugar, It shall be so.âSay now what Colour? Dopp. An Iron Gray. Bom. and Dopp. Country all over. In Love when we join, And sweetly combine, No Dress or gay Folly is needing; We despise at that Hour Gay Riches or Power, We have more in the Pleasure succeeding. CHORUS of both. In Love when, &amp;c. [Exeunt. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. A most pleasant and beautiful Bower belonging to the Apartment of Bacchus, adorn'd with glorious Images of all the Deities, Loves and Graces, and illustrated with Dorick Pillars, encompass'd round with Vine Branches, Roses, Jessamin, Eglantine, and Foliages of other Flowers. Enter Ariadne and Cellania. Cell. Salute the Morn, fair Ariadne, With Joy, and thank me for my Tidings; Glory and perfect Love attending, Descend, and Homage pay to Beauty; Let those bright Eyes, whose dazling Lustre Can captivate a Heart Immortal, Convert their liquid Pearl to Rubies, Sparkling with Hopes of Bliss approaching, Bacchus adores. Ariad. Leave, leave, Cellania, And let me thinkâ Cell. Of awful Bacchus, All other Thoughts are of no Moment. Ariad. Did I not give up Fame and Fortune? Nay, give him Life? Oh base Ingrate! Or what's a worser Name, vile Theseus! Cell. Plunge, oh ye watry Powers, the perjur'd! But sacred Bacchus loves ye. Ariad. Loves me! Why is there such a thing in Nature? Cell. Some Signs of such a thing. Ariad. And faithful! Cell. 'Mongst Gods, but Men grown wiser slight it, The Lover chang'd, now change the Humour, Our Tears like Mens Amours should vary, Air. Grief abates when Joy grows stronger, Vain 'tis to dissemble longer, Whining, puling, sighing, crying, Beauty spoiling, self denying, Sobbing, blowing, groaning, squeaking, Lying frequently as speaking. Grief abates, &amp;c. Enter Abdalla attended by an Indian King, bearing a Crown of Stars upon a Cushion. Abdal. To Ariadne, most ador'd of Mortals, From the CÃ¦lestial and renown'd Bimater, I bring this starry Crown, a Sacred Symbol, Prov'd to the height of his most glorious Passion; Oh take it! with that Joy becomes your Fortune, And grateful Duty to the mighty Sender. Cell. In Lethargie, what Remora benumbs ye? Can ye not see the GiftâHad Blindness seiz'd ye? Gold sure could clear your Eyes. Ariad. The wondrous Graces Thrown hourly on me by immortal Bacchus, Outdo returns of Gratitude. Abdal. The Temple, Adorning yonder Hill to Clouds aspiring, With holy Priests that such Affairs are skill'd in, Will teach that Virtue; there the God expects ye, Happy in hope to make ye yet still greater: A glorious Wife. Cell. A Wife, and such a Present! Can you be musing still, still cold?âOh Heavens! Had I such Graces!âWhat are my Stars a doing? Ariad. A Crown's a glorious thing. Cel. She smiles, that's something: A Golden Circle must cure all ill Humours: Besides, a Wife too; that's no idle Matter. Ariad. Bright Immortality,âA Constellation. Cell. So now she thinks apace. Ariad. Oh happy Station! Cell. Beyond ambitious Thought. Abdall. Look here, sweet Charmer. [Shews the Crown. Air. Is it not fine? Do's it not shine. How will it grace too, when 'tis thine? 'Tis for a Crown the Warriour fights, the Politician plots, The first profusely sheds his Blood, the last is plagu'd with Thoughts. 'Tis this that fires the jarring World, to Man the greatest Joy, And this and a kind Husband too, what Woman can deny! Is it not fine, &amp;c? Ariad. My labouring Thoughts I find are all in hurry, I am not dreaming sure, this must be real; Yonder's the Temple! Cell. Haste, haste, quickly thither, And swift as Time,âfly to the great Inviter. Ariad. It must be so, the Attraction's so prevailing, From that inchanting Crown there's no defending; Sorrow adieu, thou gloomy Inmate. [Takes the Crown. Abdal. Viva. Ariad. And welcome Comfort, with angelick Semblance. Fate's Decree must be fulfill'd, Every Woman's born to yield; If with Gold they charm the Eye, Can we, can we, then deny? If they give us darling Sway, Will we, will we, then delay. Oh, no, no,âFie, no, no! Wiser is our Sex than so. Fate's Decree, &amp;c. [Gives her Hand to Abdalla, he leads her out, Cellania follows. SCENE II. An Isle of a Magnificent Temple. Enter Berontus and another Indian King. Ber. Thanks, kind Reliever. Ind. K. Are ye fluster'd? You told me late your Grief of loving, And of Cellania's Pride and Rigour, Then askt a Cure for am'rous Folly: I told ye a good Dose was certain Of Wine, and if ye have don't to purpose, Your Sighs will turn to Hiccups. Ber. Bumpers. Six in a Hand two Hours together, I've briskly top'd about, by Bacchus, I now will love him too. Ind. K. 'Tis Reason. Ber. Then I have Courage got to rally, Can stand a Frown, and if she thunder, Can bounce too in my turn. Ind. K. You're perfect! The Medicine has done well. Ber. 'Thas fir'd me, My Brain too rowls, but that's no matter. Ind. K. Yonder she comes, she's wondrous lovely. Ber. Not in my Eye, in this rare Humour, So far from fair, I think she's dowdy, I've a young Filly ten times finer. Ind. K. I wish ye Luck. [Exit Indian King. Ber. By Jove I'll at her, And well fare Bacchus, I'm thy Convert. [Stands apart. Enter Cellania. Cel. 'Tis done, 'tis done, the Priest of Hymen, Has join'd 'em,âNow then for my Fortune, Have what I'll ask, what shall I think on? Ber. On me, if you like it. [Coming to her. Cell. On you! [Scornfully turning to him. Ber. And lose all your Labour. [Haughtily too. I, like a true Scythian, scarcely should value the Favour. Cell. Yet still you will teize me, you and your tawny Complection. Ber. Oh pardon my Freedom! yours is not wholly Vermillion. Cell. You swore you admir'd it. Ber. That might be, when I was frantick. [Aside. Cell. His Bluntness offends me, [The Recitative changes. sure 'tis a Trick of Dissembling, Then am I not charming. Ber. Not half so much as a Fairy. Cell. No Beauty nor Humour. Ber. Better I've found in a Dairy. Cel. He vexes in earnest; come, Prince, suppose I could love ye; What, what would you do for't? Ber. Not give one snap of my Finger. I've got a new Nature, and am so far from a Lover, I'm now grown a Toper, Bacchus is Jupiter Ammon; I once was your Idiot, and how you us'd me remember, Made horrid your Fantom, your Ignis fatuus Beauty; You, you and your Cupid, whom now I push from my Bosom, And deep in a Bumper, drown him with Ruby Phalernian. Air. If Celia's Coyness grieve ye: One Bottle take, two Bottles take, three Bottles take, 'Twill certainly relieve ye, See, see, that glorious Brimmer, The Son himself looks dimmer, Ah! does it not divine shew? Can Celia's Eyes e'er shine so? 'Twill baulk, 'twill baulk, Love's purblind DÃ¦mon, And make a Slave a Freeman. If Celia's Coyness, &amp;c. The inner Part of the Temple opens and discovers Bacchus and Ariadne, Hand in Hand, both crown'd with Garlands; Abdalla with Priests and Priestesses, they having just perform'd the Marriage, Indian Kings and Attendants. Bacchinalian Men and Women. Priest of Himen, and Priestesses of Bacchus hold the Crown of Stars between 'em; come forward and sing. Priest. Pleasure's nearest to Divine, Mortals gain by Love and Wine. Priestess. Praise we then this glorious Pair, I'll the Victor, she the Fair. Priest. May no Chance their Passion sever, Priestess. Let 'em live and love for ever. Both. May no Chance, &amp;c. [Here she goes up and crowns Ariadne. A Symphony of joyful Musick sounds, then an Antick Ceremonial Dance of the MÃ¦nades, after which Bacchus sings. Bacch. Bear Witness, Jove, and all ye awful Gods, That smiling sit in your sublime Aboads, And view me with a Joy divinely rare, Do Grace CÃ¦lestial to this mortal Fair. How well I am repaid,âWe're then, my Love, That precious Crown design'd thee from above And be from henceforth in the lofty Skie, To Sons of Art, that nightly Wonders spy, A dazling Constellation, shining there Brighter than Hebe's Path, or CasiopÃ¦a's Chair. Ariad. Where have I been till now? what painful Dream Of flashy Vanity? or Cares extreme, Have lull'd my Sense? Oh thou that giv'st me Joy! Abate it, lest the vast Excess destroy me. Abdal. The Deities at Ariadne's Birth, Design'd her the most glorious Queen on Earth, But that's a Trifle to what now she owns, In the Immortal Grandeur dol'd by Bacchus. Bacch. Oh conquer'd Venus! veil thy baffled Eyes, And vie not here, for Shame. [Embracing Ariadne. Ariad. Yours is the Prize; Bacchus excels all Inmates of the Skies, In charming Hue, and more inchanting Feature. Cell. Fine Art of Love, both Hearts are sure at ease, That are so full of one another's Praises. Ber. My Heart, I thank my Stars, is easy too, As being light with Wine, and rid of you. Abdal. Our noted Joy gives each Plebean some, They wait for your Admission. Bacch. Let 'em come. Air. Both Heaven and Earth to day, Shall frolick be and gay, The Sun, The Moon, All Kinds Of Winds Delight alone shall shew: The Mutes, The Brutes, The Bowers, The Flowers Shall revel here below. Both Heaven, &amp;c. [Here follows the first Entertainment of Clowns, &amp;c. Then whilst Bacchus and Ariadne, with Abdalla, Cellania and Berontus are seated, with Indians, Satyrs, and Bacchinalians attending; Doppa comes in, having seen Bombey in his Clown's Dress, who seeming asham'd to appear, she pulls him in and sings. Dopp. Can you flye me, charming Damon? Have I then out liv'd my Beauty, Phillida that us'd to please ye, Is her Kindness grown a Trouble? Bomb. Oh fie! nay Doppaâ Dopp. What's the Matter? Be not asham'd of your Perfections. Bomb. Zooks, yonder's Bacchus. Dopp. Here's a Lover, And must commend your Transformation; For now you look like what I'd have ye, A harmless Shepherd plain and simple. Bomb. Simple indeed, I'll stay no longer, Those gay Folks laugh at me. Dopp. Admire ye; And e'er you go they shall have Reason: Come, have you learnt to sing the Ballad, I like so well? I've my Part ready; We'll have it here, the Godheads yonder, Shall hear what we can do. Bomb. Why, Doppa, You're mad sure! Pish, you know I'm hoarser Than a crackt Pipe. Dopp. You sing with Humour, That makes Amends,âCome, come, let's do it Quickly, I'm gone else,âBut chant boldly; I'll shew ye afterwards my Closet. Ah, Bombeyâ Bomb. You're a little Devil. Here the Ballad is sung by both in Parts, which ended, Bombey going to seize her, she runs through the Guards towards Bacchus; they laugh; then enter Bacchinals, each with a Bottle in his Hand, and entice him off; then comes on a second comick Entertainment of Dancing; which ended, Bacchus and the rest come forward and sing. Ariad. Stay, stay a while, ye fleet, soft footed Hours, Fly not away so fast, let Joy have leisure; The pleasing Inmate newly fills my Bosom, And Time must bless me with a Space to own it. Excess now cloys, oh how shall I be grateful! Give me a Bowl of Wine. Pardon, ye Virgins, Of nicer Rule, [An Attendant gives her Wine. and MÃ¦nades uphold me, 'Tis on a Cause uncommon.âHealth to Bacchus, Sound o'er the Globe the Word is. [Bacchus and all take Goblets. Bacch. Ariadne! Ariad. CÃ¦lestial Bacchus! [Drinks. Bacch. Charming Ariadne! Sound Trumpets, 'till the Air reverberating Replete with joyful Echo's, shake Olympus. Omnes. CÃ¦lestial Bacchus, charming Ariadne! [They drink, here the Trumpets and all the Instruments flourishing, Ariad. Oh Ecstasy! be mild, or else you kill me. Air. Woman will no more require, I have all I can desire; What the skilful Wife approves, What the trembling Virgin Loves, What the Politician courts, What the grave Divine exhorts, What the Lepid old would ease, What the young would always please. Woman will no more, &amp;c. Bacch. Fill round agen, and bring the Goblets fuller, The Repetition's sacred sound too louder. [Sound the Trumpets, with Kettle Drums and more Instruments. Omnes. To sacred Bacchus, charming Ariadne. Beron. Oh glorious Sight! Beauty and Wine uniting, Jove try the Art of Painting. Abdall. 'Twere a Mast'ry, A Deed fit for a Deity to practice. Air. When Flora in Fresco a Brimmer is holding, Goddess Nature, methinks, a new Model is moulding; The Rays of her Eyes shine a thousand times stronger, And her plump rosie Cheeks are still fresher and younger: Her Lips, like two Cherries, in Paradise growing, Seem to blush with Delight when the Burgundy's flowing. When Flora, &amp;c. Bacch. Now, that the Pow'rs above may ne'er be tainted With Breach of Promise, ask thy Boon, Cellania. Is it Berontus? Cell. No was ne'er said better Than on this Subject. Ber. There we're both agreeing. Cell. Woman cannot, Woman cannot With a Churl be e'er at Ease, Who will sullen grow, and dull, And is of himself so full; He his Wife can never please. Ber. Man's a Cully, Man's a Cully, Who himself to Woman pins; Whilst her Humours vainly cross, Still the Game go's to his Loss; More he plays, the less he wins. Bacch. More private Conference must end this Matter, They're sullen both, but Love has still Vagaries. Re-enter Bombey very drunk, and reeling [Led in by a Satyr and Bacchinal.. Bom. And so has Wine, of that be Witness Bombey, Gods and Kings ([Kecks. egh) I don't know who, I'm as great (egh) as one of you; Nay, (egh) if Wine can solve the matter, One Degree (egh) I think I'm better: For now I'm a much greater (egh) Prince, Because I am not (egh) plagu'd with Sense; For those that are not drunk (egh) are mad, And (egh) this 'tis makes (egh) the Times so bad. Gods and Kings, &amp;c. [They carry him off. Bacch. The Night approaches, thought of nuptial Blessings Regale my Heart, and fill my Breast with with Transport. Come, sweetest of thy Kind, and give LenÃ¦us Proof, a Divinity there is that's Female, Excelling quite the Male. Omnes. All Joy to Bacchus. Bacch. and Ariad. Oh! oh! the Rapture's sweet When panting Hearts do meet, Air. When eager Passions joining, Each other entertain, And Nature, Joy designing, Charms every Pulse and Vein; The Soul away is flying, Extreme of Life's in dying. Oh! oh! the Rapture, &amp;c. Abdall. Attend the glorious Pair.âJoy to LenÃ¦us. Grand CHORUS. Oh! behold a Ray Divine In yon' gay Horizon shine; Planets there for Brightness all contending. 'Tis fair Ariadne's Crown, Bacchus for her is come down, And she, the lovely she, will now be soon aseen End of the Opera.</field>
