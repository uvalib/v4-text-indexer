      <field name="fulltext">TO HERBERT TRYST, ESQ. OF THE CITY OF HEREFORD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE WRITTEN BY AARON HILL, ESQ. SPOKEN BY MR. CIBBER, JUN. New to the stageâby no past praises fir'd! Young, and unfam'd, and but by hope inspir'd: Raise us to reach that hope's ambitious call, Or with soft pity, break our threaten'd fall. Small tho' our merit be, your minds are great, And undeserv'd applause may worth create: Sweetness sits smiling, where the heart beats true, And they praise most, to whom most praise is due. Low let me court ye to befriend our cause! If justice pleads not, generous pity draws. In a full world, our author lives, alone Unhappy!âand, of consequence, unknown: Yet, amidst sorrow, he disdains complaint; Nor languid, in the race of life, grows faint. He swims, unyielding, against fortune's stream, Nor to his private suff'rings, stoops his theme: Adopts the pains which others undergo, And, for your pleasure, feels not his own woe. They shou'd themselves be pleas'd, who love to please; And he who fears not mis'ry, merits ease. Oh!âsave unfriended virtue from distressâ 'Tis the divine prerogativeâto bless! Sad, for the tragic scene, your hearts prepare, Where love kills friendship, and awakes despair; Where cherish'd mischiefs tow'r above controul, And warring passions rend the tortur'd soul! Taught by the pictur'd woes, which weep to-night, Let long-weigh'd caution guide your wishes right: Slow, thro' your eyes, give smiling ruin way; Love, by that pass, but enters to betray! Beauty fades fastânor will it's transient grace Sooth the sick bosom, when the thought takes place. But when twin souls each other's transport claim, And pant and burn, and twist their struggling flame, Safe let 'em meet, by no false fears oppress'd; Form'd to be one, and, till rejoin'd, unbless'd!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Earl of Northampton and Sir Gervas Elloways. Nor. How cheerfully hath this day's light broke forth! The new risen sun, drest rich in orient beams, Beholds, with triumph, the late wife of Essex Transplant her beauties, from his barren shade, To flourish by the heat of love and Somerset. Ell. Never shall I forget the tempting bride! Such dazzling lustre sparkled from her eyes, That the proud gems she wore shone dim beneath 'em; Inviting warmth glow'd lovely on her cheeks, And from her tongue flow'd such melodious sounds, That list'ning rage grew gentle as her accents, And age was youth again by looking on her! Nor. Yet, tho' her features are as soft as air, Strong passions urge her mind to manly daring! Work'd up by nature with unusual strength, Vengeance, ambition, and the warmth of greatness Swell in her soul, and lift her above woman. Ell. That Overbury, who oppos'd this marriage, Will frown on its conclusionâHe's your enemy! When corresponding with the court of Rome, 'Twas he who intercepted dangerous letters. Nor. He did, nor think that I forget he did it: My genius, baleful as a comet's blaze, Hangs o'er his head, and burns with red revenge! Nay, he's my rival too!âThat fiery thought Glows in my breast; and as I weigh my wrongs, I swell like Ãtna, when her sulph'rous rage Bursts o'er the earth, and rolls in floods of fire. Ell. Your Isabella, Somerset's fair charge, Is sure an abstract of divine perfection! While Overbury's love, like a black cloud, Cuts off, and intercepts the glittering prospect. Nor. O! name it notâit must not, shall not be! Old as I am, I'll snatch the pleasure from him; And love and policy shall join to crush him. Ell. You know her charms are Somerset's disposal. Warm in the lustre of our late Queen's graces, 'Tis strange, to mark the power of time to change us. Her father shone the favourite of the court: But when his day of hope at length declin'd, Drove by his enemies he fled to Scotland, Pin'd there, and, chill'd with sorrows, died an exile. Nor. 'Tis wellâbut I have news more worth relating! Wade, the lieutenant of the Tower's displac'd. Ell. May I remind your lordship of a promise? Nor. Thou needst not, Ell'ways, I so truly prize thee, That were my mind big with my country's fate, With plots, which known, would blast my life and honour, I shou'd, I think, unfold 'em to thy friendshipâ Of that hereafterâSee, the bride approaches! [Exit Ell. Enter the Countess of Somerset. Nor. Hail, to those charms! that smile upon the morn, And sweetly gild it, like a milder sun! May joys, in circles, dance away your days! And length of years sustain your bridal pleasures! Fair Somerset! now happy too, and great! Blest with perfection to the height of thought! The worth that could deserve beauty like your's, Insures soft bliss, and heaps long life with pleasure. Count. Thusâwhile a lover, talk'd my Somerset, His words fell soft like hov'ring flakes of snow, And in cold tremblings melted on my bosom! But now, alas!â Nor. You cannot, sure, suspect him! Count. He has alarm'd A pride that catches the first spark, and kindles! To be forsaken, is a thought of horror! Oh! it wou'd grate the woman in my soul, To have my pride subdu'd and make me mad! Tho' but last night our nuptials fix'd him mine! Starting this morning from my slighted arms, Thought seem'd to press his mind, sighs heav'd his bosom, And, as repenting of his wish possess'd, Full in the blushing dawn, he rose and left me. Nor. There is a damp, I know, that clouds his joys, A vapour, which your warmth might soon disperse. Count. What points my uncle at? Nor. I'll speak it plainlyâ Overbury!â That restless foe of oursâyour husband's friend! This morning is expected. Count. Overbury! Then aid me indignationârageâand vengeance! Nor. Wisely, you call on rage for its assistance; Justice would be too slow for your revenge, And conscience bids us give it up for ever! But what is conscience?âa thin empty name, That terrifies, like ghosts, by fancy rais'd. Ev'n the most brave use stratagems in war; And what are plots against a private foe, But self-defence?âthe first great rule of nature! Count. My lord, I see to what your counsel leads me! I am a woman! nay, a woman wrong'd! And when our sex, from injuries take fire, Our softness turns to fury!âand our thoughts Breathe vengeance and destruction! Nor. Spoke like yourself! Count. Oh! I'm transported with inspiring heat! You know I never lov'd the Earl of Somerset, 'Twas interest, 'twas ambition won me to him; And there's one thought, I own, has rack'd my peace, The only one I e'er conceal'd from you. Nor. Instruct meâIt may serve us as a plan, From which I'll raise a pile of tow'ring mischief, Shall nod with watchful horror o'er his head, 'Till, tumbling, it shall crush him into ruin. Count. Know then, with shame I speak it, I have lov'd him! Nor. Lov'd whom?ânot Overbury! Count. Yes! lov'd him, more than I detest him now! Each thought, look, gesture has confest the folly! Nay, I have wroteâO heav'n! I know not what! Reason was fled!âand every thought was madness! And now he may betray me! Nor. May! he willâ These letters must be artfully won from him: Succeeding, we stir Somerset against him; Revenge, with transport then, would sweeten all The rage of slighted loveâurge that discreetly: I know the temper of your lordâ'twill fire him!â Touch but that point, and jealousy pleads for youâ But mark! he comes, and seems amus'd and pensive: 'Tis fit we partâanon we'll fix our scheme. [Exit Count. Enter Earl of Somerset. Som. A kind good-morrow to my honour'd uncle! Now fortune seems to smile in earnest on me; This last night's blessing crown'd my warmest wish, And kindling fancy from the thought takes fire! Oh! my good lord! language gives way beneath it, The painter's colours, and the poet's art Cou'd touch but a faint image of my joys. Nor. And yet, if I mistook you not, at entrance, Your looks were low'ring, and your bosom labour'd! Thro' the gay smile of your dissembled joy, I saw th' obscuring shade which wrap'd your soul. Som. Sure, you mistook!âI think I was all rapture! How I adore your nieceâbe witness, heaven! Witness ye soft desires! that swell my veins, And beat but to the music of her loveâ Dearly I love her! to distraction love her! Nor words can speakânor thought can feel my passion! ButâOh! Northampton! Nor. Speak. Som. I have a friend Dearer than life! and, as my honour, precious! Our wishes and our interests are the same! Friendship has join'd us in so strict a band, As if one parcel'd soul inform'd us both! Yet heâ Nor. Let not his partial hate of her perplex you! A wife becomes the truest, tend'rest friend, The balm of comfort, and the source of joy! Thro' every various turn of life the same. For men, they are not as they were of oldâ Oft their professions are the arts of interest! You'll find the friendship of the world is show, Mere outward show! 'Tis like the harlot's tears, The statesman's promise, or false patriot's zeal, Full of fair-seeming, but delusion all. Som. Not soâthen might I think you not my friend! Shall I, because I live in faithless times, Distrust a virtuous man? or shou'd I slight A faithful fair-one, 'cause her sex are false? If these are maxims, ties can bind no more! All that is human is for ever lost, And brutes are e'en as we are. Nor. Come, my lord! This Overbury! he's the thorn that galls you! Trust me, I know him wellâhe has a soul Too harshly form'd for such endearing friendship. Som. Greatly you wrong him! I have found him tender As first-made mothers to their erring infants. Firm to his prince, and faithful to his country; A braver subject England never boasted, Nor man a nobler friend than Overbury. Nor. Can he be justly call'd your noblest friend, Yet sacrifice your bliss to private malice? Let not a show of friendship make you wretched, Nor break the bands which heaven and love have made. Som. Know you, my lord, so little then of Somerset, That you can wrong him with so poor a thought? My wife! to tell you but how much I love her! 'Twou'd, like eternity, admit no end. Nor. I've doneâyour safe discretion be your guide. [Exit. Som. A wife! a friend! Oh! they include all joys! And love and friendship are so near a-kin, They shou'd, like poetry and music, join! Each form'd to grace the otherâWhy, then, in me, Why, in my breast, shou'd friendship jar with love? Enter Sir Thomas Overbury. Som. Fly to my armsâWelcome as ease to pain, As health to nature, or relief to want! Over. O Somerset! engraft me on thy bosom! Each day of absence seem'd a ling'ring age! But I have hasted e'en to out-strip time! Left the dull hours behind me as I flew, And reach'd the goal of all my wishes here. Som. Friends, who thus meet, possess so soft a bliss, That none, but those who taste, can guess our joy. Over. May ours live to the last verge of being! Nay, ev'n in death! for then, if thought remains, Shou'd mine but meet a soul in worlds to come, Whose generous flame sublim'd it from the rest, I shou'd be apt to call itâSomerset! But tell meâfor my mind has dwelt upon thee, Has thy fond heart regain'd its liberty? Does the late Essex yet appear herself? Or art thou still bewitch'd with her inchantment? Som. Alas! thou know'st not what a lover feels. Over. Have I a soul for friendship, not for love? There's one who knows my softness but too well! Knows how her beauty fires! her virtue charms me! Essex, I see, still hangs her witchcraft round thee. Som. Wou'dst thou but view her with impartial eyes! Over. Why, I confess she's fair; and when she talks, Inchanting softness melts upon her tongue, And flows in seas of mischief!âShe has beauty, Which spreads and blooms like a fresh-opening flow'r! But poisonous adders lurk beneath its stalk: And from such briars shoots this lovely rose, It wounds the touch which it invites to crop it. Som. But let me beg thee, if thou lov'st thy Somerset, If friendship makes my peace of mind thy care, No more to shock me on this tender point. Over. 'Twere flattery all, not friendship, to comply! The wound can ne'er be cur'd that shuns the probing! Kind is the hand that wipes the dust from virtue, And counsel is a friend's peculiar office. Som. Trust me, my friend, that counsel comes too late. Over. Hear me!âfor, as I love thee, I will speak! What tho' her outward charms attract the eye, Virtue, the gem within, is long since faded! Her fame, like flesh that blackens in the sun, Is blown and bloated by the breath of thousands, Now, as a man, weigh well ere you resolve, For when a woman's reputation's gone, All that repenting virtue can inspire, Can never fix it in its state again. Som. Cruel report, I know, has wrong'd her worth! Envy still feeds upon the fairest fruit, And spreads its poison on the wings of virtue; It blinds ev'n Overbury to accuse her. Over. My lord, my lord, I am no stranger to her! Her trial with her late wrong'd husband, Essex! Her loose pretensions for that wish'd divorce! I know it all!âand, by my soul, I think, Dear, as I love thee, could'st thou stoop so low As to receive that wanton to thy arms, 'Twould shake my friendship soâI could not scorn theeâ But ere I'd see thy shameâI'd range the world, And leave thee to the ruin thou'rt so fond of! Should'st thou!âAlas! what mean those starting tears, Big drops of sweatâdead palenessâtrembling limbs! Signs of some strong confusion! Som. O my friend! I must notâcannot hide a thought from thee! She, from whose charms your friendship wou'd dissuade me, Is now my wife! Over. Your wife? Som. My much lov'd wife. Over. Oh! what are men who love!âMy lord, I've done! One sigh to friendship onlyâand no more! All those convulsive starts that shock thy frame, Were the prophetic warners of my fall. Som. Said'st thou thy fall! fall first a thousand Somersets. Over. That I still love theeâwitness this embrace! Witness these tears!âbut from this fatal hour, Join'd, as you are to herâwe part for ever. Som. O stopârepentârecall those hasty words! What! part for ever! Over. For ever our alliance, not our love. Som. I fear I have no friendâbut Overbury. Over. You have a wife, and friendship is her office! It stings my soul to see thee thus betray'd, And my foreboding heart e'en bleeds with pity! All that is left me now is to avoid thee, And not to see, what but to hear will kill me. Farewel, my lordâmay ceaseless blessings wait you. [Exit. Somerset alone. Som. Sorrow, eternal sorrow claims me now! All happy fortune flies for ever from me! Whate'er's worth wishing for on earth, I've lost. Life is a dream, disturb'd by constant cares, And he, who is not lov'd, finds death a blessing. Friendship's dear ties for generous souls were made, When they relax, black woes our peace invade! Friendship from every ill can life defend, Our guardian angel's but a faithful friend. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. CONTINUES. Isabella, Cleora. Cleo. Why, Isabella, are these sighs of sorrow, While crouding joys invite your blooming youth? Love rears a thousand little tender fears, Fate, with a smile auspicious, bids you hope; To fear is to distrust a power supreme, The watchful guard of virtue in distress. Isa. Have I not cause to fear a thousand ills? Cleo. No! your lov'd Overbury comes to cheer you, Then let weak malice work up threatning mischief, Soon shall the fairy structure melt away: Tho' Somerset's new bride tries every wile That slighted love, to hatred turn'd, can practise, Her soul's chief secrets she unfolds to me, As I to you disclose 'em. Isa. Kind Cleora! Our friendship grew and ripen'd with our years! When forc'd to lose thee at my father's death, How mournful was our parting. I bless'd the chance, When I beheld thee, with my guardian's bride, Companion of her hours. Cleo. Of me no more: Now let your Overbury fill your thoughts, And every accent swell with sounds of love. Isa. Oh! my Cleora! he will ne'er be mine; A dreadful dream, last night, has warn'd my soul: Love had, methought, ordain'd our nuptial rites; But sudden, while before the priest we stood, A low'ring cloud hung o'er the temple's roof, And, with slow horror, spread a fleecy darkness. From its black center burst a rattling shower, Th' lab'ring air groan'd big with rolling thunder, Red, thro' the gather'd gloom, flash'd lightnings broke, And the rent veil let in a dreadful glare, Which, with portentous quiverings, gleam'd upon us! The altar totter'dâand the lights grew dimâ A hollow wind sigh'd coldâand from their graves Pale ghosts stalk'd shadowy, and scream'd hideous round me. But oh!âaround my love fierce brightness glitter'd, A fire, triumphant, curl'd about his form, And, winding upward, snatch'd him from my sight. Cleo. Yet he's not lostâSee! where he smiling comes! Let me not stay to interrupt your joys. [Exit. Enter Overbury. Over. O take me, take me, to thy heav'nly bosom! Here let me pour out all my hoarded thoughts! Here tower my joys! my cares be here dispers'd! Isa. I have a thousand tender things to say! A thousand doubts at once to be resolv'd! Three tedious months have heavily roll'd on, And not one thought, perhaps has chid thy stay: But while thy voice so sweetly strikes my ear, My joys revive, and melt away my sadness. Over. Let my soul bless the music of those words! My heart breaks rapt'rous at the softning sound! I feast my famish'd eyes upon thy smiles! I touch theeâand am lost in extasy! A tide of thrilling joys flows thro' my veins, I pant with pleasure, and I burn with love. Isa. I cannot, if I wou'd disguise my thoughts, 'Tho, 'tis perhaps, a fault to look thus kindly: But, oh! beware! for thou hast dangerous foes! Beware, Northampton, who pretends to love me! Beware the woman who deludes thy friend! Watchful, I strive to counterplot their mischief, And guard thy virtue from impending danger! Over. Oh! thou rich source of everlasting pleasure! Virtues rise mix'd, and sparkle in thy soul: One glittering charm pursues another's shine, As while I cut those seas which brought me near thee, Sweet sun-reflecting waves roll'd glassy on; And this no sooner kiss'd the shore, and dy'd, But a new follower rose, and swell'd as lovely. Enter Northampton. Nor. Why start you, Madam, â at a lover's presence? Unveil your clouded beautyâsince, this morning, A smiling son looks gay on our friend's nuptials. Isa. My lord, I want the courtier. Nor. Not the woman! I see a too-successful rival near youâ Sir, I shou'd speak you welcomeâYou are happyâ But, Madam, since your charms may be neglected, For boys, unskill'd, find gems, whose worth they know not! When such your fortune proves, think of Northampton, And smile, tho' late, on one who lives to love you. Over. My lord, this injury but provokes my scorn, The next may move my anger. Nor. Am I threaten'd? Awayâthou buzzing insect of the court! Ove. Reproaches are too mean for brave mens anger, Or I could sting thy arrogance with talking! Be wise! nor urge my sword against thy meanness, Worn for a nobler quarrel. Nor. Sir, 'tis well! When we meet next, what now remains to say, May be debated. Over. At your speediest leisure. [Leads off Isab. Northampton solus. Nor. Well, Overbury,âthou dost right to spurn me! If plots have power, if oaths have force to crush thee, If there's a magic spell beneath the moon, Or poison can be drawn from baneful plants, Then horror, from my fury, light upon thee! Enter Countess of Somerset. Count. My lord, I know not if I'm yet betray'd! My foe shot by me with a gloomy brow, Nor bow'd his head in passing. Nor. Saw you your lord? Count. I did; and strangely mov'd! The usual sweetness of his nature's lost, With folded arms he traverses the room, Now red!ânow pale! big on his wat'ry eyes Prompt tears stand tremblingâspeak to him, and he sighs! Or shakes his headâand groans an hollow answer! Then, on a sudden, starts!âand flies observance! Nor. Now is the time to fire him to our purpose! Their friendship broke, I have a further plotâ Ere night this Overbury sees the Tower. Count. Wolsey nor Burleigh ne'er projected better. Nor. Haste we to execute resolves of weight. An active fire shou'd quicken vast conceptions! For, when delay's cold influence chills our schemes, Some adverse fate comes, like a furious blast, And kills 'em ere they ripen into action. Count. O! I can match thee with an equal flame, Not e'en the soldier's fury, rais'd in war! The rage of tyrants when defiance stings 'em! The pride of priests so bloody when in power! Are half so dreadful as a woman's vengeance. Nor. 'Tis a warm thought, and fires the mounting soul! Revenge dares strike at every thingâ Rivers of blood mark out her smoaking way! And kingdoms flame to give her triumphs lustre! Welcome, dread vengeance! Count. Let the priest-ridden vulgar worship virtue! Thou, virtuous Overbury, sleep, and dream! Dream of philosophy, and puzzling honour! Of heavenly visions, and immortal shadows! Till slow revenge leaps suddenly upon thee: Then start!âbehold who strikes! and so expire! Nor. Soft! the earl comes!âbe on the nicest guard! Prove thy success but vast as are thy wishes, Thy name shall swell on fame's immortal voice, A wonder among women! [Exit. Count. He comes!ânow aid me, all my sex's falshood! Enter Somerset musing. Som. They say, our thoughts distinguish us from brutes! Wou'd I had never thought!âI had then been happy! Reflection rivets woe upon the wretched! Thought teaches me to feel a friend's lost worth! When we have friends, to them we trust our griefs, Our care lies lighten'd, and the mind sleeps calm: To me, that comfort's lost!âI have no friend! Oh! I cou'd pine away this wretched life! Lean, like a willow, trembling o'er a brook! Sigh with the winds! and murmur with the stream! Count. His heart seems press'd with care. [Aside. My gentle lord, Why leave you thus the gaiety of friends? And why has grinding grief usurp'd your soul? Som. I found myself disorder'd, and I left youâ Oft am I thusâleave me, I'll soon return. Count. Oh! my dear lord, I am not soon deceiv'd, Those care-bent brows suit not a bridegroom's face! Are folded arms the gestures of delight? Or these sad groans the voice of inward joy? No, noâconsider, I am now your wife! 'Tis mine to ease your cares, and bring you comfort! If you have sorrows, I must claim my part; I sink not soon beneath a weight of woeâ If you deny me this, you love me not. Som. Not love thee! sayst thou? Oh! thou soul of Somerset, Cou'd those bright eyes be turn'd into my breast, There wou'd you see how your suspicion wrongs me! Let me look nigh!âlet me gaze here with wonder! Where's friendship now? Why, reason yields to beauty! What tho' the crimes, of which her foes accuse her, Glar'd, broad as day-light, on my startled soul, Angels play smiling in her wanton eyes, And lend an awe to lightnessâlove reigns round her, And when she speaksâthe softest, sweetest music Melts in her voice, and charms away my grief. Count. Oh! with what art you sooth my fainting spirits! Then I am still your dear, your much-lov'd wifeâ Why do I ask? those eyes confess I am! But tell meâfor you shou'd impart your caresâ Why are you thus? Som. Oh! Count. Nay, again you're cruel! Still when I strive to search the cause, your voice Sinks from the point, and answers with a groan. Som. What cause?âI told thee I had been disorder'dâ Thy fears are the wild coinage of thy fancy, A subtle self-tormentor! Count. 'Tis well, my lord! I guess to whom I owe my loss of power; You have a friend can tell you tales of honour, And teach you how to triumph o'er a wife, Who has, indeed, had faultsâbut whose chief crime Is loving you, perhaps, with too much fondness. Som. What dost thou mean?âwhat friend? Count. Why, Overbury! I know your tutor chides your faulty conduct! Go then, and make your peaceâbe meekly penitent, Promise to err no moreâand he'll forgive you. Som. Hear me, sweet tyrant!âBy my life, I swear Thou'rt dear to me, as crowns to the ambitious! Dear as these eyes, which tremble on thy charms, Or, as this heart, which aches with joy and anguish. Count. Then I must tell you, Sir, your friend's a villain! Som. Have a care! Let not thy rage transport thee to detraction. Count. Oh! were I but to speak his base attempt! Som. What base attempt! Count. No matter what it is: I, sure, may be allow'd some secrets too. Som. Nay, this is wrong!âto brand him first with villain! Then, in a dusky phrase, elude the charge! Truth seldom lies conceal'd in mystery, Clearly to reason she reveals her light, And errors vanish, like a mist, before her. Count. Whyâwhat if he design'd against my honour? Som. Your honour! 'tis impossible!â Count. Form all that treacherous guilt wou'd dare to act, And sum it up in this pretended friend. Som. I prithee, do not make me mad! â speak plainly! Count. Knowing your passion, he durst urge his ownâ He told me you were false!âdesigningâjealous!â Try'd every art of treachery to supplant you; And when he found his wiles were unsuccessful, Attempted force, and threaten'd me with slander. Som. Force!âSlander!âthou hast warm'd me!âthink once more! He cou'd not be so base! Count. He was. Som. Impossible!â Ere yet my fury mounts into a blaze, Ere I upbraid him with these black designs, I charge thee do not tax him wrongfully, For thou may'st open such a scene of horror, 'Twill shake thee to behold it! Dare you confirm it with an oath? Count. I will. Som. Nay, but weigh well what you presume to swear! Oaths are of dreadful weightâand, if they're false, Draw down damnationâthose who murder fame, Kill more than life-destroyersâThink again! For, at that day, when each must stand arraign'd, Their lots will fall in the severest fires. Count. By all my hopes, What I have saidâ Som. No moreâI must believe youâ Believe you, said I! what must I believe? If you prove false!âif you traduce my friend! And wrong my faith! may sorrow blast thy beauties! May conscience rise in all her dreadful triumph! Scare every sense! and strike thee with distraction! Yet, sure thou'rt true! those eyes which shine so sweetly, Can wear no dusky stain of barbarous falshood!â What then must Overbury be? Reflection Sickens with doubt, and dies in dark confusion. Count. My lordâ Som. Thou need'st not speakâI said I would believe thee; Thou art my life, the fountoin of my joy! Yet, let me think!âForce!âSlander!âyes, 'tis so! He's false! he's false!âCurse on all treacherous friends! Count. Nay, but I meant not thus to fire your anger, Forget a friend's first falshood. Som. Never! never! Noâtho' this day was vow'd to peace and love, Tho' crowds of noble guests have grac'd my joys; Nay, tho' the king should add his sacred presence, My fury brooks no stayâmy fame! my honour! Both are concern'd, and rouze my soul to vengeance. Enter Northampton. Nor. Why are the bride and bridegroom thus retir'd? Crouds of all ranks press in to join your pleasures! And every instrument of music vies To sound sweet notes, and swell the hours of love. Som. Alas, my lord! even harmony grows harsh! Thought's out o'tune, discord has struck my ear, And my soul jars within me. Nor. What's the cause? Som. 'Tis a vile world, Northampton! The oaths of friendship, like those made to girls, Are meant but to betray, and broke o'course. Nor. This I knew well beforeâbut who has wrong'd you? Som. The darkest of all villainsâa false friend! But as I am a man, I will revenge it!â Oh! what a change has my poor heart sustain'd! But a few moments since, this man's lov'd memory Sat soft, as brooding halcyons, on my soul; Now my rouz'd rage cou'd hunt him in full scent, Till his last dust were scatter'd in the air, And driven like chaff before the angry wind. Nor. My lord, this seems th' extravagance of passion! When anger rushes, unrestrain'd, to action, Like a hot steed, it stumbles in its way! The man of thought wounds deepest, and strikes safely; Premeditation makes his vengeance sure! And levels it directly to the mark. Som. I cannot, like a courtier, kill with smiles! My fury scorns to glow, conceal'd in embers: No; it shall blaze abroad with flaming lustre! If I must fall, why I was born to die, And fall as a man shou'dâIf I revenge me, I right my injur'd honour, as I ought. Nor. My lord, this stream must have another course: This Overburyâ Som. Saidst thou Overbury! Now, by my soul, there's magic in the name, And my charm'd rage grows still as midnight silence! Why wou'dst thou speak it?âLet me not dwell upon him! Talk of false friendship! of abandon'd honour! Of hate! revenge!âdistraction!â But spare that nameâat which my fury melts, Or guilt will smile, like sweet-ey'd innocence. Count. My lord, I wish you cou'd surmount your anger. 'Tis nobler to forgive, than to revenge. Som. Dost thou plead too!âwhyâhe has wrong'd thy fame! E'en to my ear has wrong'd it!âgenerous charmer! Nor. Your frowns will blast what sprung but by your smiles. Som. I'll think a whileâyour counsel shall direct me. Thou injur'd friendship, my griev'd soul inspire With awful justice, and vindictive fire! Let my revenge, to match th' ungen'rous wrong, Be swift as eagles, and as lions strong! Dreadful as flames by furious whirlwinds driven, Or thunder bursting from offended heaven! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Northampton and Countess of Somerset. Nor. The King comes here in privateâthen all's right, And, in good time, we've stirr'd your husband's anger. Count. The courtiers are in Overbury's interest. Nor. No matterâthey'll desert him in his fall: Like Persians they adore the rising sun, But when the great man's glories shrink away, Shrubs, which grew under him, shoot up ungrateful, And brave him in declensionâNone assist him, No kind hand lifts him from engulphing ruin, But all join strength to press him lower stillâ You have not heard, perhaps, that Overbury Courts friendship with your Essex. Count. How! with Essex! Nor. What if he should betray your letters to him? Count. The villain dares not! Nor. If he does, you're lostâ What! know you of his love to Isabella? Count. Oh! name it notâ It cannot beâI've fear'd, but would not find it. Nor. Wou'd 'twere a secret thenâbut see this packet, These are his letters to that Isabella. Their superscriptions wantingâhappy that! To tell how I acquir'd 'em, would be tedious: Let it suffice, these undirected papers Shall bear the force of proofs to Somerset, Most fatal to his friend. Sir Gervas Ell'ways, Who bears a weighty part in this design, Is coming tow'rds usâPlease to leave him with me. I am an exile from the royal presence, But you, the King expects, should bless his eyes. [Exit Countess of Somerset. That he sees Essex I am well inform'd, And blew that spark to raise her to a flame. Enter Sir Gervas Elloways. Let me congratulate my faithful Elloways! The Tower-lieutenancy will now be yours, For Somerset has said it. Ell. My kind lord! Nor. Nay, I have news That more will please you, if you love Northampton. The man I hate will soon be in my power. All the proud steps, by which he climb'd to greatness, Sink from his feet, and let him fall to ruin. Ell. Can Somerset forsake him? Nor. He detests him. Ell. Prodigious change!âthis news indeed surprizes! Nor. To gain the unbeliever to my wishes, I stirr'd his temper with such cautious art, That, ere his judgment cou'd exert its phlegm, His blood took ferment from a warmth of passion: Then, while his fi'ry spirit flam'd with rage, In its full heat, I stamp'd it with revenge. Ell. The depth of wisdom flows, in all your actions, Like a strong current, which, oppos'd by piles, Works gently thro', and saps the mound unseen, Till, gathering force, it pours resistless in, And the bank floats before itâEnd you there? Nor. NoâOverbury's death must crown my conduct! Ell. There's danger there! Nor. Not soâI've weigh'd it well. Th' assassinating Spanish way's unsafe, Suspicion were its followerâand suspicion Wou'd, like a bloodhound, trace our steps too near! What think you of the close Italian's means? Sure, silent poison?âDare you be a friend? Ell. I dare the worst. Nor. Know then, that Somerset Has noted Overbury as most intimate With some, whose zeal is mark'd against the state: Now to inflame the King with jealousy, An embassy to Russia will be offer'd him: This love and policy forbid him taking, And if he not accept it, all's confirm'd; It speaks him plainly loth to leave his faction, And so he comes committed to your care. Ell. The rest may be compleated easily: 'Tis but to change the doubted officers, And place such round him as will suit our purpose. Nor. No moreâbe secret. Enter Somerset. Som. Good Sir Gervas Elloways! I greet you gladly, with your new-giv'n honour, Which the King's pleasure, thus confirms by me. [Delivers a commission. Ell. My lord, you bind me ever to your service. Som. Ohâmy Northampton! Nor. Why that sigh, my lord? Som. I have been thinking, when we lose a friend, 'Tis like an eye pluck'd from its bleeding orb. No more the other holds the joy of sight, But, ceaseless, weeps till it grows blind with anguishâ So mourns my widow'd soul for Overbury. Nor. Why do you name him still thus tenderly? Methinks your wrongs shou'd rise against your weakness, And sting you with reflection. Som. Ay, mention those, and I relapse to fury! My restless thoughts drive round like veering winds, Forgetful of their center!âyet the soul, Like a soft babe, inur'd to foolish fondness, Is hard to wean from wailingâOh! forgive me: 'Tis the last struggle of expiring friendship. Nor. Your passions late were wing'd, like vengeful whirlwinds, Now they sink, sighing, to a gale of sorrow! Shame on your softnessâwhere's the soul of Somerset? Where's that fierce fire which us'd to kindle in you, And sparkle, from your eyes, in fierce resentment? What! all extinguish'd? Som. No: I am still the same. I've the King's orders for this embassy, And Overbury's sent for. Nor. If he refuses, We place him on the pinnacle of fate! There shall big-gathering winds sing round his head, And whirl him to destructionâEll'ways be ready. [Exit Elloways. Som. But, my good lord, this treachery startles me, 'Tis an unmanly vengeance. Nor. Fye, my lord! Som. Why, rather, not accuse him face to face, And, with an open anger, prove the charge? Nor. There may be guilt, you wou'd not wish to proveâ Look on these letters! sent without direction! Artful and safe that cautionâKnow you the hand?â How soft are the contents! Som. Wou'd I were blind! Nor. Wou'd not he wrong his King who wrongs his friend! Come, come, my lordâyou must be won to wisdom! Tho' the soft dove brood, gall-less, o'er your breast, Yet let the wary serpent arm your mind. Som. O heaven! he comes! he shocks me with his presence! Nor. See!âEssex leaves himâhad he been your friend, He wou'd not thus be seen. My lordâfarewel. [Exit. Som. 'Tis death to meet him!âyet I cannot stir. Enter Sir Thomas Overbury. Over. My lord, I come obedient to your summons, The force of friendship oversways my griefs, And I must love you still. Som. Dissembling villain! [Aside. I have a message from the King, this morning, That will, I doubt, surprize youâ'tis his pleasure, That you prepare yourself, without delay, For a short embassy to Russia. Over. The warning's sudden! Som. The design is deep! Perhaps too, not propos'd by your best friends. Over. Now, my lov'd lord, I'll try your friendship's faith! When sick'ning reason labours in the mind, Advice is the soul's cordialâHow shall I act? Som. If honesty's your guide, you cannot stray. Over. If to be blest and honest were the same, I shou'd not be unhappy. Som. He seems innocent. 'Tis a hard struggle to dissemble thus! [Aside. Over. If your looks wrong you not, you are disorder'd! Som. Have you resolv'd? I wait for your reply. Over. So cool in your advice!ânay, now I read you! Northampton and your wife!âSerpent and woman! Have turn'd you 'gainst your friend! And your plain mind, unfashion'd for deceit, Knows not to veil its frailty. Som. Have a careâ Over. What! am I threaten'd too? â ungrateful Somerset! Have I advis'd you with a brother's tenderness, Pin'd for your peace, and made your cares my own, To be rewarded thus?âHere end our friendship! And, for my answer, I desire a pause. Som. Then I must tell the King, you're not resolv'd? Over. That as you pleaseâI'll serve him till I die, Till the reward of loyalty o'ertakes me: For patriots still must fall for statesmens' safety, And perish by the country they preserve. Som. 'Tis dangerous, thus, to tax the royal gratitude! I see you're rash, and wou'd advise you betterâ If, when you touch'd me in too weak a part, I shrunkâ'twas from quick sense of aching pain. I was to blameâI knew not what I saidâ Excuse it as a friend. Over. Said you, you were to blame?âif you're sincere, My fit of rage, like lightning on a desart, But flashesâand is lost. Som. Can he be false? And yet I must not doubtâ [Aside. Over. What! still uneasy? Som. You know, I'm rais'd on fortune's fav'rite spoke! If I grow giddy, I shall move away, And roll, at once, to ruin. Over. Let me guard youâ And, to be near you, not accept this embassyâ Form some fair cause, and urge it as my answer. Som. I'll to the King this instant, and attempt it. [Exit. Over. This message, from the King, bears some design, But I'm more touch'd with Somerset's disorder! Let me still mark himâAs he passes on, He starts!âstops short!âand ponders in suspence!â Now he proceeds!âAll this shou'd bode some mischief! Enter the Countess of Somerset. Count. Now, now, support me, pride, or I am lost! [Aside. Over. Ha! she here! Count. Why start you, calm, insulting man? Is love a crime too great to be forgiven? But thy cold soul admits no warmth of passion: I, like the sun, darted too fierce a blaze! Yet, thy chill wishes Dawn'd some sick hope, when Isabella's eyes, Like a pale moon, gleam'd her faint beams upon thee. Over. How! knows she that? [Aside.] When honour lights up love, Th' illumin'd soul burns lambent with a flame, Pure as the hallow'd altarsâSuch my hope! Such were the wishes mov'd by Isabella. Count. How I disdain thee!âyes, I scorn thee!âhate thee! Thou, who cou'dst stoop to expose a woman's weakness! To taint her fame, and blast her to the world!â All my fierce passions rise with that reflection, Inward they rageâa winding train takes fire, The flashy blaze runs swift thro' ev'ry vein, And my brain splits with agony! Over. You wrong me, MadamâI, with humblest gratitude, Thank'd and conceal'd your passionâIf your fame Is taintedâyour divorce has caus'd itâModesty Must guard a woman's seemingsââ Oh! that my words, like the sun's powerful rays, Were with attraction arm'dâtill, from your breast, This flood of frailty rose, exhal'd in sighs, Or flow'd away in streams of soft repentance. Count. Upbraider! Over. I not upbraid your love, but your wild passions, Which wou'd, like envious shades, eclipse those beauties, That else, with justice, sure, must charm mankind! But, Madam, thinkâthere's not a homely peasant, If grac'd with innocence, tho' nurs'd in toil, But boasts more glory than a tainted grandeur. Count. Preaching statue! Where are my letters?âthou detain'st 'em poorly, With aim to awe my anger. Over. Ere you ask'd 'em, Mov'd by a conscious hope to ease your fears, Honour induc'd me thus to give 'em up: Now, they are yours againâBut their effect Will still live in me, and whene'er your image Enriches my remembranceâthe humblest gratitude Will teach my heart new tenderness. [Gives letters. Count. This generous act has waken'd love again, And pity pleads against meâWhat shall I do! If I continue here, and he thus charms me, My scheme, at once, is airâLike jarring elements My passions warâand thought opposing thought, Shakes my whole frame, till I am mad with doubting. [Aside. Over. Why are you thus disturb'd? Count. Can I so ill reward his generous heart, As to apply these letters to his ruin, Which might have ruin'd me, had he with-held 'em? And yet I mustâFate's slippery ice has caught me, And, if I not slide on, I sink for ever. Let me not stayâO wretch! death hovers o'er thee! He grasps a dart, and, in pale fury, shakes it High o'er thy head!âNow, now it falls, and strikes thee! I cannot bear to see what I have caus'd. [Exit in confusion. Over. Or I'm ensnar'dâor madness seiz'd the countess. Enter Isabella. My Isabella! Isa. Oh! let us join as friends, who meet in sorrow, To weep!âand sigh!âand mingle mutual woes! Over. What wou'd my love's soft fears divine of ill, That merits this sweet sadness? Isa. Oh! I am wild! and say I know not whatâ This will explain. Enter Sir Gervas Elloways, and guards. Ell. Sir Thomas Overbury, I come to bring you an unwelcome message; 'Tis the King's pleasure, that you stand confin'd, Close in the Tower, a prisoner to the state. Over. What have I done, that I should be a prisoner? Ell. Has not the Earl of Somerset inform'd you? Over. The Earl of Somerset!âWhat dost thou mean? The polar star shall be no longer fix'd, But turn delusive to the sailor's eye, Sooner than Somerset prove false to meâ May I not see my friend? Ell. I dare not grant it. Over. No!âthat's hard, indeed! I thought I cou'd have met the worst, unmov'd; [Turns to Isabella. But to see thee thus press'd with griefs not thine, I cannot bear the pang which rend my soul!â Teach me some art, but to assuage thy sorrows, And mine are griefs to smile at. Isa. The voice of music can compose distraction: Oh! then, let thine but sooth me into comfort; Say something soft and kindâBut whither fly you? Perhaps to death! Over. What's death but losing thee? Life is a trifle, where no love enriches it; And when the guiltless die the death of traitors, The scaffold steps, but, like the patriarch's ladder, Form an assent to heaven. Isa. Oh! talk not thus! There's madness in that thought. Over. Nay, do not weep! Thy grief attracts with such a melting forceâ That my lost soul evaporates to air, Glides in each breath, and mingles with thy sighs â Help manhood, or I'm lost!âlead to the Tower. Isa. That place bodes ruinâthere, the good sixth Henry, Clarence, and royal Edward's infants fellâ Such secret death, perhaps, may prove thy fate. Over. Why dost thou fright thyself at fancy'd ills? Isa. I have a thousand, thousand anxious fears!â No cheering hope dawns thro' the cloudy woe,â 'Tis darkness allâWhat will not malice dare? But if I mustâ Over. Oh! I cou'd gaze for ever! Thus, when high seas swell foaming o'er the coast, The wretch, who treads the dangerous beach is lost; Plung'd in his fate, like me, he strives to rise, And seeks the swallow'd land with wistful eyes! But, as his arms extend to reach the shore, The waves o'erwhelm him, and he's seen no more. [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE The Tower. Northampton and Elloways meet. Nor. Ell'ways be swift, for Somerset's unsettled! The Countess too, who lately urg'd his death, Melts in a fit of softness from her purpose! Besure the stream of ruin then rolls rapid, To bear him down the tideâFor, if it turns, 'Twill overwhelm us all. Ell. Now, by my soul, The youthful warrior, flush'd with his first hopes, Burns not with half that heat for fame and conquest, Which fires my wishes to compleat your will. Nor. Weston and Franklinâare they both resolv'd? Ell. They are. Nor. Have they the wine the Countess has prepar'd? Ell. They have, And bring it as a present from Earl Somerset. Nor. Then he, who late, by royal favour shone, That favour veil'd, shall straight be dark again. So waters, at hot noon, aspire in steams, And thin'd by heat, float gay aloft in air! But when the sun's exhaling power withdraws, Chill'd by the cold of night, they fall in dews, And mix with humble dust, like Overbury. Ell. See, my good lord, where Isabella comes, To visit in the Tower her prison'd lover! Nor. My faithful Ell'ways, watch my rival well; And if your ear catch a suspicious sound, Bring me immediate notice. [Exit Ell. Enter Isabella. So, Madam, your proud hero falls his plume! Isa. Is that a Noble's voice? The brave, I thought, Scorn'd all advantage o'er a fallen foe, And rais'd him to be worthy their revenge. Nor. Since there's a storm upon your angry brow, I am not arm'd to meet, I must retire. [Exit. Isa. So, villains, when they gain th' ascent of power, Like ravens, pois'd before the glorious sun, Spread a black cloud, and darken all beneath. Enter Overbury, followed by Elloways listening. Over. Are you thus kind? blest with your lovely presence, A prison is a paradiseâsweet mourner! Matchless in joyâbut in thy grief all heavenly! In thee, as in a dewâdrop on a flower, A thousand mingled beauties glittering play, Which rise, as the eye turns, in still new prospects, And in each different light, refract new lustre. Isa. Why wilt thou charm me thus?âthy tuneful voice Floats soft like music, melting in the winds! A flutt'ring rapture fills my trembling breast, Swells in each vein, and pants with every thought! Yet do I view thee, with such dangers round thee, That e'en thy sight is painful! Over. Wer't not for thee, my soul wou'd wing her flight, To rest in realms of everlasting bliss. Isa. How know'st thou that?âWeigh first what is the soul: 'Tis not a shade that will dissolve in air, Nor matter which, by time, can be consum'd: Oh! then, be cautious, for the best are frail; Venture not rashly, on an unknown beingâ E'en the most perfect shun the brink of death, And shudder at the prospect of futurity. Over. What means my soul? Isa. A thousand deaths are hov'ring round thy head! If I have e'er deserv'd thy loveâOh! think Thy guardian angel now inspires my tongue, And warns thee, if thou canst, to 'scape disguis'd! Ell. I've heard enough. [Exit unseen. Over. No; safe in innocence, I'll dare their malice. To fly, wou'd be to leave my fame unclear'd, My fame, much dearer to me than my life! Isa. Forgive me, if I err; 'Tis but a fault that springs from too much love! Should'st thou be lost!âOh! think upon my griefs, See me distracted, without hope of comfort, Profaning heaven, reading the air with shrieks, Bursting with groans, and raving with despair! Over. Why was I born to make thee thus unhappy? But see, where one observes! 'Tis dangerous here to talkâTo-night farewel, And if to-morrow blesses me again, I shall have news to tell you. [Exit. Isa. Till then, farewel. Enter Cleora in haste. Cle. My friend, forgive me, if officious zeal Forc'd me to seek you hereâyour foe, the Countessâ Isa. What of the Countess? Cleo. Flies about disorder'd! So stung with guilt, no place can give her ease! Wild 'twixt the sallies of remorse and love, She wrote these lines, and trusted 'em with me; I think it not a treachery to betray 'em. Isa. 'Tis pious treachery that reveals a mischief; 'Tis justice to yourself, and to the world. [Looks on the letter. To Overbury!âHow my heart beats at it! Cleo. She there, repeats, and urges an old flame, Proffers him freedom, wou'd partake his flight, And owns the wiles that have seduc'd her lord. Nay, moreâthe guards are, by her agents, brib'd, And your name's us'd to cover the deceit, That, should they fail, she might be still secure. Isa. Here too, she urges him to feign some illness, That, so retir'd to rest, and none left near him, She in the silent darkness introduc'd, May find him in his chamber, and instruct him What means may bring him safety: Fate sent this clue to unravel all her falshood; Flatter her artfully with his compliance: And if she comesâBut see, the Earl of Somerset. Night steals upon us fastâBe sure you bring her. [Exit Cleora. Enter Earl of Somerset. Som. My Isabella!âwhy that mournful brow? Why do those eyes, that sparkled gladness round 'em, Lose their keen lustre now, and look so languid? Isa. Shou'd I forget, my lord, that fatal day, When my dear father's trembling hand prest yours, His dying eyes, wet with paternal tears, While agonizing sweats bedew'd his face, To you, my lord, he rais'd his falt'ring voice, And gave me to your care? Kind was the thought, And pleas'd, he bade farewelâand breath'd his last. Som. Have I not us'd thee with the tend'rest care, And chear'd thy virtue with the smiles of fortune? Isa. Oh! my good lord, you've been a father to me, And 'tis for you these swelling sighs rise sad, And my tears flow for gratitude. Som. What mean'st thou? Isa. If Overbury wrong'dâ Som. No more of Overbury! My child, avoid him, as thou wou'dst thy ruin. Isa. You are misledâ Som. The subject's harshâfarewel. Isa. You must not goâthus on my knees, I beg you, For your own sake, but hear meâyou're betray'd. Oh! think how dear this man was to your soul! By friendship join'd, you comforted each other; Joy crown'd your days, your minds were then serene, Your thoughts had harmony, and you were blest. Som. Indeed, I thought so. Isa. Oh! reflect again! Why have you cast him thus unkindly from you, And open'd your dear breast to vile Northampton? Som. Why dost thou injure thus my lord Northampton? Isa. One, who wou'd undermine an orphan's virtue, Is sure unworthy of her guardian's friendship. Som. And cou'd Northampton that? Isa. I blush t'affirm it. Yet more your virtue wanders in the dark! The Countessâ Som. Who!âI charge thee, name not her! Shou'd I but hear a word to taint my wife, 'Twould urge me so, I might forget my nature, And use thee harshly! Isa. 'Tis death to undeceive you! But, in the cause of virtue, I am arm'd To meet all dangers boldlyâbe prepar'd, For I must wound you with such piercing accents, That your poor heart, I fear, will bleed with anguish! Som. Suspense is the worst rackâspeak what thou know'st. Isa. Read thisâ'twill speak all for me. [Gives a letter. Som. 'Tis my wife's handâha! To Sir Thomas Overbury! A strange direction that! where had it you? Isa. From one she trusted as her messenger. Som. Sure 'tis some mist, which hell has rais'd to blind me! My eyes belie herâlet me again peruse it! Isa. 'Tis as I thought. [Aside. Som. 'Tis all black forgery!â False Isabella! Isa. Who is false, my lord? Som. Why thou art falseâI prithee, own thou art; For should an angel charge her with these crimes, I fear I shou'd misname that angel, fiend! Isa. 'Tis but to wait her presence, if you doubt it; Night is already round us, and ere long, She comes, conceal'd, to find himâBe you witness, And then, who's false, discover. Som. If thou art so, fly, where I ne'er may see thee! But if thou'rt true, then I'm a wretch indeed. Isa. My lord, retireâI think, she comes already. [Exeunt. Enter Countess of Somerset and Cleora. Count. O my Cleora, whither am I going? But thou art faithful, nor wilt chide my frailties! I go t'atone my Overbury's wrongs, To meet my loveâmy love!âWhat's then my husband? Hold brainâresist that rushing rack of thoughtâ The night, now brooding o'er her gloomy shades, Owns not a spectre half so foul as I am. Oh state of horror! Oh despair! O shame! Cleo. Yet thinkâ Count. Fain wou'd Iâbut all thought forsakes me! My flame revives!âeach fit comes stronger on me! Varying convulsions torture every nerve! I love! I rage!âhateâfearâand love again! And burn, and die with a whole war of passions! Cleo. But will you see him? Count. See him?âOh! I mustâ My soul will have it soâthe wrongs, I meant him, Require atonement, more than love can give him, Comeâguide me, my Cleora! [Exeunt. Enter Northampton and Elloways. Nor. Escaping! say'st thou? Ell. What I then heard was little. But now a trusted yeoman of the guard Betray'd their whole design of present flight; But why have you, thus led me thro' the darkness? Nor. The darkness best befits my purpos'd vengeance. Ell. What means my lord by vengeance? Nor. The poison not yet givenâmy sword shall end him. Secure the passageâbar the outward doors, While I resolve within, where Weston left us. [Exeunt. Enter Somerset and the Countess, meeting in the dark. Count. 'Tis wond'rous dark! and night wears double horror! Each step, methinks, I hear my husband's voice! The creep of distant whispers damps my soul! Hark! how the thunder rolls! the wind too roars! Who's that, my Overbury? Som. Yet hold my heart! [Aside. Count. You had my letter then? Som. I hadâOh heaven! Count. Reach me your hand, and lead me to your chamber! For I have much to sayâbut stayâCleora Waits me hard byâI'll caution her a moment, And find you here again. [Exit. Som. Why do I live? Let me turn wild!âOr tear out my fond heart, That cou'd be thus far wrong'd, and not discern it! O thou false woman! O my injur'd friend! Mad, rash, deluded Somerset! Enter Northampton from a private door in the back scene; a light within. Nor. Now, Overbury, die! [Draws. Som. Villain!âNorthampton! [Draws. Nor. Save me, some angel, from this strange illusion! Som. View my eyes well!âdo they not flash with fury? And tell thee, that 'tis Somerset thou look'st on? Nor. Northampton was not born to look with fear, Tho' hell blaz'd angry in the eyes of Somerset. My honour's equal!âmy descent more noble! Come, we mistake each otherâas a friend, I'd moderate this rage. Som. Thou sycophant! Thou wouldst again betray me to thy friendship, To ruin, with more ease, my Isabella. Nor. Ha! Som. But she is proof against thy base assaults: My wife was easy, and success there met thee, And Overbury was to fall your victim. Nor. No moreâI can no longer brook this railing; Whate'er I do, I always dare to answer! Let this defend it allâ [Fight, Northampton disarmed. Som. Why art thou living in the power of Somerset? I wish thee dead, but dare not kill thee basely; Give me the chance once moreâ [Offers his sword. Nor. No; take my life; 'Tis now not worth defending. Som. Live, and repent!âand be as curs'd as I am! Goâsave me from the pain thy presence gives me! Now, whither shall I wander? [Exit Northampton. Going, meets the Countess entering. Death and confusion! Count. I heard, or I'm deceiv'd, the clash of weapons, Yet was the passage barr'dâyon gleam of light Shews a drawn sword bent hither. Som. Tremble at itâ'tis the sword of justice! Count. Ha! let me not betray myselfâ'tis Somerset. [Aside. What mean you, Sir? methinks your words sound angryâ Som. Traitress! false! foul! fickleâdamn'dâlovely traitress! Know'st thou this letter?âthou ungrateful woman! Count. Now I am lost indeed! Som. What can thy guilt expect? Count. You will not kill me? Som. Not kill thee, say'st thou! yes, deceiver! Hear me; Hadst thou as many lives as thou hast crimes, My fury wou'd reach allâwrong'd love and friendship, With double cry, demand thy death in vengeance! Count. Oh! but do hear me. Som. Not one siren word. Count. Oh! by the endearing softness of that bosom, Look but on her you lov'd so much! so lately! See how she pants for life! and begs for mercy! Let me die, slow, some ling'ring death of sorrow, But send me not to the eternal bar, With all my crimes about me! Som. Do, crocodile, weep onâthy tears become thee. Think what I suffer! think how thou hast wrong'd me! Oh! I will stab thee!âtho' my heart-strings burst. Count. Yet, but a moment, hear me! Som. NoâI will not; Be dumb for everâfor, whene'er you speak, You bring a base infection o'er my anger, And I, at once, grow sick with pityâOff! Why cling'st thou to me? Count. O spurn me!âdrag meâ Yet my poor limbs shall grasp thee to the last, And e'en my dying groans plead soft for pardon. Som. Wherefore, just heav'n, has guilt such power to charm? Oh!ârise, and take those mournful eyes away; Thy beauty, and my love combine to save thee, And my sword turns its point against my purpose. I cannot see thee bleed!âOh! my torn heart! Ungrateful! goâ Fly from my rage!âfar hence, on some lone isle, Safe in thy frauds, and pleas'd with ruin, smile; But shun these shameful eyes, which thus deplore Thy lossâyet never must behold thee more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Somerset solus. Som. How have I wander'd thro' a maze of errors, And labour'd for destruction!âOf mankind, I had but one true friend, and him, alone, Of all mankind, have wrong'dâReproachful thought! Oh! Peace of mind! thou bosom balm of nature! Thou that canst make the labourer's misery sweet, And cause e'en smiles amidst the pangs of death, Where shall I find thee? Enter Isabella. Come not near me! Let me not hear thee speak, lest I betray thee, But fly me as a desp'rate, dangerous villain. Isa. I come, my lord, to reconcile your soul To the sweet joys of peaceâ Som. Talk not of peace! 'tis gone! 'tis fled with honour! Honour, once lost, can never be retriev'd! My thoughts are furies all!âand turn upon me! I feel their whips!âThey lash me with remorse! My brain grows hot!âHell glows in my mad bosom! Isa. Your friend yet knows not how you were misled. Som. But there's a sense of shame that knows it all! Tho' mountains shadow'd me, they cou'd not hide it! My red'ning cheeks, and my moist eyes wou'd speak it! Let me fly, far as the vast ocean rolls, Rather than see the friend I've basely injur'd. Isa. Fly but to Overburyâtell him all! And, once more met in the strict band of friendship, United, rise the pillars of your country. Som. How must he scorn me, when he knows my treachery! I cannot bear that thought! Isa. Yet the mild kingâ Som. For thy poor father's sufferings in his cause, The royal ear will listen to thy pleadings: Oh! fly, and swiftly save my friend from ruin! Isa. But look, my lord!âSee where the countess comes! Som. What say'st thou? ha!âI cannot bear their presence! Oh! for a whirlwind's rage to snatch her from me! A hell of mischief kindles in her eyes, And horrors blaze around her!âLet's avoid her! [Exeunt. Enter Northampton and Countess of Somerset. Nor. Now, haughty Somerset! I'm well reveng'd! My sullen genius tow'rs, with scorn, above thee, And smiles at disappointment. Count. My lord Northampton, Tho' strongly urg'd, I feel a woman's softness! Revenge, remorse, and love divide my soul, Like three wild streams that rush against each other! Nor. Yet, still, be resolute, Summon your reason to your passion's aid! Think how you're treated by your angry lord, Menac'd, cast off, and but revenge can save you. Count. Now you have urg'd the flint again to sparkle, And flash'd up all the latent fire within me! Die, Overbury!âSomerset!âdie all! Let the world burn to be my funeral pile, And nature groan as I do! Enter Elloways. Nor. What news, Elloways? Ell. The deed is done! So deadly is the poison he has swallow'd, There's not a nerve but has receiv'd its death: Horror and madness shall infect his brain, Till ev'ry struggling vital, torn with pangs, Must burst at once, and tortur'd life forsake him. Count. Mean'st thou all this of Overbury? Ell. Of himâWe brought the wine which you prepar'd, As a sent pledge of friendship from your lord; Straight, with an eager haste, he snatch'd the cup!â Give me the draught, said he!âthen swell'd the brim, And, thro' his lips, he drain'd it to the last. And now there's not a health-restoring herb, Which the sun smiles on, can expel th' infection. Count. Was it the wine I sent? Ell. Madam, it was. Count. Then shall I never know a moment's peace! Villain, be curst!âWhat have we done, Northampton? Nor. A deed, which is not now to be recall'd. Count. And dost think heav'n will conceal this murder? No! we shall be pursu'd with hourly vengeance! Dreams will disclose it; or, if night wants eyes, Lightning will flash, and point us out to justice. Nor. Will you be mad? Count. I willâyou have undone me! Plung'd me for ever in the depth of misery! Hark!âthere's a tell-tale wind groans hollow under us, And the earth heaves with wonder! Nor. Her grief distracts her! Count. 'Tis false! Thy tongue shall never more delude me! Ha!âMurder's shriek'd already in my ears! Hark! Heav'n rings with murder!âthe red clouds Rain a whole sea of smoaking blood upon us! Oh! I am stain'd all over!âMurder!âMurder! [Runs off. Ell. My lord, this fit may prove a dangerous frenzy. Nor. Our lives are set upon this single cast. Retire we to some safe retreat a while, Where we may watch th' event. [Exit. Ell. What shall I do? Fly from my post I cannotâthat pleads guilty! Poor Overbury comes! Enter Sir Thomas Overbury. How fares my noble prisoner? Over. Why just as noble prisoners ever fare, Like lambs encompass'd by devouring wolves, Or harmless birds with kites and ravens round 'em. Ell. I cannot hear him speakâhis presence pains me. [Exit. Over. I know not why, but I am shock'd of late! My dreams are dreadfulâBe it as it may; While virtue arms me, what have I to fear? This cold clay cottage is but the soul's prison, And death, at worst, is but a surly friend, Who conquers to give liberty. Enter Somerset. 'Tis well, my lord, you can at last remember me, But had my Somerset been thus confin'd, I had not learnt to shun him. Som. Oh, my friend! I'm not the Somerset, whom once you knew; I'm alter'd much of late. Over. Ay, thou art marry'd! Som. That was the fatal rock we both have split on! You, like a skilful mariner, discern'd itâ But I, bewitch'd by the curst siren's voice, Sail'd on, regardless, 'till we struck on ruin. Over. Whyâdost thou repent it? Som. Repent it, said you?â Oh! I cou'd rave!âbut, 'tis too late a penitence, For I have wrong'd thy friendship, and undone thee! Over. Nay, that I still believe thou cou'dst not do! Som. Thou dost not know how base thy friend has been!â Oh! that fair devil has ensnar'd my soul, And stain'd it o'er with falshoodâI, led by her, Accus'd thee to the king. Over. Forbid it, heav'n! Lest I grow sick of lifeâand curse mankind! Som. Oh!â'tis too true! Wrought by my faithless wife, And curst NorthamptonâI contriv'd thy ruin! Over. Why look'st thou, then, like man, who art a monster? Som. Yet by the memory of our dear friendship!â Over. How dares thy tongue profane the name of friendship? Haste to the king!âclear up my sully'd fame, Or, may'st thou always bear some mark of traitor, That every one may know, despise, and shun thee. Som. Hear me but speakâ Over. Why should'st thou grate my ear? The bird of death's shrill screamâthe hiss of serpents, Are music to thy voice!âmy sick'ning soul Faints at thy presenceâand thy stay wou'd kill me! Som. Yet I must stayâ'till you forgive, or pity me. Over. Name not forgivenessânor expect my pity. Be gone! there's treachery couch'd in this delay! Mean'st thou to bear more mischief to the king? Som. Rather than pierce me with such words as these, Strike through my heart, that bleeds to 've done you wrong, Hereâtake my swordâkill meâbut, as I fall, Reach me thy handâsay, but thou hast forgiv'n me! And I shall die in peace. Over. Take back thy swordâI wou'd not use it basely, Thou know'st, I wou'd notâGo, for ever from me! And when I hear of an ungrateful wretch, A fawning slave, who smiles, while he betraysâ Then will I think of Somerset. Som. Distraction! Canst thou? but, peaceâI have deserv'd it all! Life's a disease, which I want strength to bear, And wish for death to cure meâWhat was I born to? Shame on the guilt that bids me bear these scorns, And not dare think 'em injuries. Over. (After a long pause) âOh! Somerset! [Both stand silent: Overbury observes the posture of Somerset. Can all this grief be real? Som. What shall I say? Over. Had any other thus contriv'd my ruin, I cou'd have borne it with a manly patience! But from thy hand! my friend! my very self!â Such unexpected wrongs have shook my soul! ButâI forgive thee allâ Som. Oh! joy! Oh, friendâ Forgive my softness too! my tears will flow, While I re-join thee, thus, to my glad breast. Over. I feel my heart bound high with throbbing transport! And wou'd speak more, but the slow-rising words Die in big, unborn accents on my tongue. I feel, e'en now, a faintish damp all o'er me, And I am sick at heartâBut here comes one, Whose heav'nly brightness can disperse all clouds! My life! my Isabella! Enter Isabella, running into his arms. Isa. Liveâlive, my Overbury! Scarce can I speak my transport!âbut the king! The gracious kingâ Over. What of the king, my love? Isa. Has yielded to my suit in thy behalf, And giv'n thee liberty! Over. I thank thy goodness! And blessings croud about his royal head, Who heard my Isabella's prayer with pity. How my soul swells with ecstasy!âmy friend! My Isabella!âWhy do you not rejoice? Rejoice in love! in friendship! liberty! Som. Live long thus bless'd. Over. Here, in soft sighs, I'll pour my pleasures forthâ Gaze!â'till I e'en grow giddy with delight! Now, heav'n, thou art too kind. Isa. Oh happy day! So sweet a calm, as my late cares are hush'd in, Ne'er yet succeeded such a threatning tempest? But you, methinks, look pale! Over. Noâsay not so; My heart is but oppress'd, and sick with transport!â Another start!âthat rapture was so strong, It shot quite thro', and trembled to my soul! Another yet!ânay, now I scarce support itâ My spirits sink, exhausted with delight, And nature reels beneath it. Isa. Oh! help! he faints! Som. Heav'n! a cold dew, Like that of death, o'erspreads his icy temples. Help! who waits there? [Enter Attendants. Isa. My love! my Overbury! Return to lifeâ'tis Isabella calls! Over. Where, where are now my joys? All fled at onceâOh! Somerset! I'm poison'd! Som. Good heaven forbid! Over. The wine!âthe wine you sent! Som. Say'st, thou, I sent? Alas! you are impos'd on! Over. Then 'twas thy wife, And she disguis'd it with thy powerful name. Som. Ten thousand plagues o'ertake her for the deed! Oh! if she acted this unnatural guilt, May all the woes of vengeance be her portion! Haunt her, pale ghosts! Eternal anguish grind her! Lash her, ye furies! Adders, twist around her! And let despair and endless torment seize her! Over. Ha!âwhat a shoot was there!âmy blood boils in me! Flames wind about my breastâmy brain burns red, And my eyes swim in a blue sea of sulphur! Stand off!âand let me breathe!âwhat's that grim form, That stalks along! and creeps so pale upon me? I know the meagre phantom now!â'tis death! He's gone!âand now the heav'ns all open to me! A flight of angels swoop upon my head, And clap their wings about me! Som. What a slave is man, when passion masters him? My want of reason is the cursed source Of all their miseries: But I'm trebly curs'd! I feel for him, for her, and for myself. What place in hell is there reserv'd for me? Sure that which holds the greatest share of pain! Over. There's death again! What unmov'd! beamless! hollow! limy eyes The bone-built monster stares with! there he struck me! 'Tis done!âI mount!âI rise above the clouds! My brain grows giddy!ânow 'tis wond'rous hot! The rays scorch strongâthe stars spout streaming fire! I'll shade me in the moon's dark body!âHold! The sun's reflection's thereâOh! help!âdefend me! Som. What can I do to ease thee? Over. Who touch'd me?â'twas a cold, and deadly hand! It makes me shrink!âsave me! where am I now? I'm chain'd in the chill region of the north! My blood's all frost!âand passing my hot veins, It hisses in its motion!âThe bleak winds Dip their broad wings in seas of melted snow, And sweep whole winter o'er me!âI shiver at it! My teeth are turn'd to ice, and, as they chatter, Break in their strikingâWhere's friendship now to warm me? Som. My friend!âmy Overbury! Over. Oh, Somerset! Where have I been?âmy life is at a period! Poor Isabella!âshe's o'erwhelm'd with grief! Let me conjure thee, by my dying friendship, To comfort all her sorrows! Som. Wherefore do I not rave? But heav'n is just! To lose my senses, is to lose my pain. Oh! I resign me to th' impartial hand Of justice, nor dare murmur at my fate. Over. Hark! the wind roars!âthe seas begin to swell! The billows roll!ânow! now they drive upon me! Oh! save me, or I'm lost!âwhat! must I perish? Is there no hold?ânot one kind, friendly plank! Helpless indeed!âthus in the gulf, I sinkâ Never to rise again. [Dies. Isa. Hover a while, dear shade, and I'll o'ertake thee. Oh! for a dagger now!âDeath, give me ease! He comes!âI feel him at my heart already! He brings me all I wish! Som. Alas! she swoons! Be quick, and bear ger gently from the bodyâ But, be sure, guard her with the tenderest care, Lest her distraction shou'd commit self-violence. [Isa. led off. Now dear, departed friendâ'twere just, that I, The wretch, whose crimes have been the cause of all, Shou'd, on these clay-cold lips, breathe out my last. Enter Officer of the guards. Off. My lord, your pardon, but you're here a prisoner: Your wife has, in a fit of raving frenzy, Confess'd the murder on Sir Thomas Overbury. Sir Gervas Ell'ways, and the rest impeach'd, Are seiz'dâand say, the wine was sent from you. Som. Oh! the vile traitress!âguard her from my sightâ But leave me hereâand let me slow expire. Close by the truest friend, and best of men! Oh!âwou'd the world be warn'd by my example! Fly, ye fond youth, the guilty fair-one's arms, Nor judge their excellence by outward charms; They, who, for faithless love, true friends betray, Chuse glitt'ring toys, and throw rich pearls away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. WRITTEN BY AARON HILL, ESQ. SPOKEN BY MRS. BRET, IN THE CHARACTER OF ISABELLA. Well!â'tis a shameful breach, in honour's laws, To court the credit, and betray the cause! But, faithful to my sexâPray ladies! hear meâ And if the poet murmurs, smile, and clear me. He bids me say, Sir Tom was justâbraveâwitty! Troth! he was e'en too good for woman's pityâ I find, by hist'ries of the poor soul's life, He wrote that frightful poem, call'dâThe Wife. There, with cold rules, he damps the glow of beauty; And fetters free-born will, by sneaking duty! His husbands are mere tyrantsâand no wonder!â They've natural right, he says, to keep us under. Pleas'dâor not pleas'dâwe must, it seems, lie quiet: And rather starve to death than mend our diet! Prompt, in obedience, wait the sovereign's motion, And do, or suffer, with resign'd devotion! 'Tis a fine lesson, truly!âBlast Sir Thomasâ Orâkeep the galling yoke of wedlock from us! Cou'd wives but once such passive grace inherit, Bless us! â what active husbands wou'd they merit! This the fine Overbury! whose just fate You've seen, to-night, dress'd out in tragic state! He make a hero!âHe attract compassion! Heaven keep these witty husbands out of fashion! Had he been mine, I'd paid him for his poem; And made him feel, what thanks we women owe him! Though lovers pleaseâand mine is a stark new one, My feign'd Sir Thomas suffers, for the true one: Bless'd be the dose, by which our match miscarry'd; Heavens!âhow I'd hated him, had we been marry'd! As to my errandâEre your smiles I pray, Thus make him mend the moral of his play: Trust not repenting Somerset's opinion, Nor strive to shake our sex's fix'd dominion. Woman does, ev'n in yielding, conquest gain; And man, howe'er contending, toils in vain! Learn, ye lost things! for disobedience hated, To what sure suff'rings rash mens lives are fated! Wisely be rul'd:âmove on the way we draw yeâ And let due sense of power superior awe yeâ Else, will your ev'ry woe be still kept waking, And your proud hearts, waste half an age in breaking: Care shall corrode your thoughtsâDespair invade ye! Dangers rise round!âand horns want power to shade ye.</field>
