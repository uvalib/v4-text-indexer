      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A rocky shore, wild and desart, with a distant view of the sea. Calypso is discovered sitting in a disconsolate posture. Antiope and the Nymphs attending. She rises. AIR. CALYPSO. Ye founts, whose rilling waters creep, In murmuring currents to the deep, Ah, teach my tears to flow! And you that o'er my island fly, Ye winged breezes, catch my sigh, And spread it as you go. ANTIOPE. How long will the divine Calypso weep For false Ulysses? Was immortal youth Only bestow'd, that you should mourn for ever? CALYPSO. I think it was. ANTIOPE. Ah, no, it cannot be; Upon that watery mirror turn thine eyes, And if 'tis fit such lustre should be given, For tears to wash it out, weep on. CALYPSO. Well, my kind nymphs, I'll strive to be less sad. ANTIOPE. Goddess, be mirthful; we were made for mirth: Give sorrow to the winds. CALYPSO. I would I could. ANTIOPE. Look at your island once so fair and smiling, What is it now? a tear-besprinkled rock, A howling waste of doleful sighs and groans, No seat, as once it was, for love and joy: But smile, dear goddess, smile again; Thy beauty hath a renovating power, Which Nature must obey. CALYPSO. I know my power Can call up spring, trick out my isle afresh In all its flowery bloom, and change the face Of faded nature; but no power have I Myself to change, or stem one falling tear; Therefore this scene were best—Yet for your sakes, All that I can, I will. Let me have music; Strange is the magic of harmonious song, And strong its workings in the hearer's heart: Sing then, but let it be some soothing air, Light, not fantastic; stealing on the ear, Not loudly storming it; and welcome 'twere, Might it take off, though but a feather's weight, From my sad bosom's load. AIR. ANTIOPE. Once this happy isle adorning, Rising suns inspir'd delight; Joyful shouts awak'd the morning, Smiling raptures crown'd the night. Now each tender flower declining, Dies in pity of thy pain; Goddess, cease this fond repining, Smile, and they shall bloom again. CALYPSO. Your music wins my sorrow to attention; It stirs it, as the zephyr does the rose, Shaking the dew-drops from its weeping leaves; But still my rooted grief resists your song. Now, wood nymph— A Wood Nymph enters. NYMPH. As I kept my watch but now On the tall summit of yond eastern cliff, I saw a goodly bark approach your isle; Lab'ring she seem'd with still-opposed helm And top-sails, courting the reluctant breeze, To stem the flattering tide, that gently woo'd her To the false smiling shore, her sandy grave. CALYPSO. Where are my magic imps, that us'd to do My sportive errands? ANTIOPE. In their rocky cave Torpid they lie, and lifeless with disuse. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Take thou my wand, and with it smite the rock: Let them all forth:—'tis well—Behold How the grim cavern yawns! And hark, they cry— Antiope having struck the rock with the wand, it suddenly falls asunder, and discovers a deep dark cavern. AIR. DÆMONS in the Cave. Magic queen, whose potent spell Binds us in this dreary cave, Loose us from our prison-cell; Save us, mighty mistress, save! RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Dæmons, come forth! [Six Dæmons come forth, bound with chains. What will you do, ye sprites, From your gall'd limbs, if I strike off These adamantine fetters? RECITATIVE. FIRST DÆMON. Sovereign, we'll dance for joy, And sing loud glees of liberty and triumph; Will run upon the moon beams, mount the winds, And jade the lagging coursers of the air To do thee grace and service, so you'll free us. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Zudore, stand forth; where is my watery spirit? East of my isle thou'lt find a goodly bark Conflicting with the gale; force it on shore, Plunge it in sand, or rive it on the rocks: Whom it contains, I know not; but if men, They must be faithless. RECITATIVE. ZUDORE. Sovereign, it is done. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Forth, and be free: fall fetters, and away! AIR. DÆMONS. Joy, joy, joy! Woeful nights and days are past, Sullen sleep and sour annoy, Holiday is come at last. Happy, happy spirits we, Leap and dance and frisk amain; Freely forth, and flit with me, Till our queen cries, come again. [They vanish. CALYPSO. They're gone like shadows, and dispers'd To all the points of heav'n; and hark, The loud turmoil begins! [A storm of thunder and lightning: the sea is greatly agitated, and the air darkened. Antiope! ANTIOPE. What wills my queen? CALYPSO. This storm, which I have rais'd, Will call up Proteus from the troubled deep: On the sea shore, upon the western point, Within his oozy haunt, you'll find the god; A prophet, as thou know'st, he can resolve me, If 'tis decreed Ulysses shall revisit His native Ithaca; to me, alas! The book of fate is shut. ANTIOPE. And kindly shut; Why wilt thou urge enquiry? CALYPSO. Nay, but go. To all but thee, ungentle, the fond monster Gloats on thy beauties; thou through all his forms Canst fix the shifting deity: away! But if thy charms prevail not, take these fetters, And, by my nymphs assisted, cast them on him, And bring him bound before us. ANTIOPE. I obey. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. The Cave of Proteus, with a view of the sea. The storm continues with thunder, &amp;c. Proteus, after a musical prelude comes out of his cave. RECITATIVE. PROTEUS. Peace, peace! forbear to lash the deep, What is this mighty coil you keep, Ye brawling winds? Would you up-rend The solid-seated rocks, and send The dashing billows to the sky? Up, father Neptune, hear my cry! The scaly subjects of my peaceful reign, Protect, great sire, and let me sleep again. AIR. Soft silent power, all-pleasing sleep, Morpheus, allay the turbid deep; All other sounds be far but those Kind murmurs that invite repose. And thou, sweet Phœbe, chace the light, And bring up sable-suited Night, O'er my clos'd eye-lids drop thy veil; Pale queen of shadowy phantoms, hail! Enter Antiope. RECITATIVE. PROTEUS. Mistress, how now! What foot prophane Invades my solitary reign? And is there in this island free, No nook for silence and for me? RECITATIVE. ANTIOPE. Sluggard, awake; 'tis I, your friend, Antiope; and now attend— By fair Calypso sent, of thee I fain would know the fates' decree: If false Ulysses e're shall reach His native shore, diviner, teach. RECITATIVE. PROTEUS. Would'st thou of prophecies enquire, Thou wanton imp of young desire? Come, snow-drop, throw around my neck Thy pearly arms, and I will speak. AIR. ANTIOPE. Embrace you! Oh, fie, No Proteus, not I, Nor cunning nor force shall prevail; Rude monster, avaunt, No favours I grant, I cannot encounter a whale. You a deity?—Pish! Great king of the fish, A prophet like you might foresee, That dominion so mute, No woman will suit, Least of all an immortal like me. RECITATIVE. PROTEUS. Wilt thou be still perverse, thou star Of dazzling beauty, still at war With thine own pleasures? Look around Through all Calypso's desart ground, Does mirth inhabit here? Come then with me, And give another Venus to the sea. AIR. Come, lovely, but reluctant fair, To Proteus' watery realm repair; Swift in thine amber chariot sweep The surface of the smiling deep. Come, and while sea nymphs sport around, (Their locks with pearl and coral bound) In chrystal palaces we'll dwell, Where scaly Tritons wake the shell. Sometimes in mossy caverns sleep At bottom of the glassy deep; There we'll live and there we'll love, And feast on joys unknown above. ANTIOPE. Where are you, nymphs? Now haste, and fetter this evasive god— Ah, you're too late! he's gone, escap'd—And look, He glares a lion—Stand, nor be amaz'd; He has no power to harm you: yes, deceiver, I know thee and thy arts; that brutal form Suits thy base nature. Give the chains to me, Yet, yet, I'll fetter him—Hah! what is this? A flaming fire. He can take any form, Each living thing, the elements themselves, All nature is his own; yet wait awhile; Too gross and sleepy for that active flame, He soon will shift, and see, 'tis done. He falls A rilling fountain—Fair betide the change! To thine own murmurs I bequeath thee, sluggard. [All the changes described in the above speech, are effected by Proteus. AIR. Ah, fountain, what cunning is this, So clear and inviting to seem? And will you not boast of a kiss, Should I cool but my lips in your stream? How fain would I sit by your side, Till your murmurs should lull to me to sleep; If I thought that your bubbling tide, Wouldn't whisper my dreams to the deep. [Exit with Nymphs. SCENE returns to the first view of the Coast. Telemachus and Mentor. TELEMACHUS. Was ever scene thus dreadful! Oh, ye powers, Why am I spar'd to be the sad survivor Of wreck so fatal? Ah, forgive me, Mentor! Thy manly arm, thy ever-present mind Snatch'd me from death; my friend himself is sav'd, And I adore the gods. MENTOR. 'Tis well, Telemachus; For if I augur right, much need you'll find In this new land of their providing care: Now to the beach—perchance the full-gorg'd deep, After its greedy meal, shall cast on shore Some fragments of our wreck; in the mean time, I will explore the isle—Why do you pause? AIR. TELEMACHUS. What do I see? Before my eyes What mangled spectres glide? Again I hear the tempest rise, I meet the dashing tide. I see my sad companions' tears, And hear their last adieu; Mentor alone serene appears, And brings a god in view. The wind blows right upon the land, The sailors toil in vain, The helm no more obeys command, She drives, she drives amain. Protect us, Heav'n! the ship runs round, Loud pealing thunders roar; She strikes, she splits! Ah, dreadful sound? She sinks to rise no more. [Exit Telemachus. Calypso, with her Nymphs, enters to Mentor. CALYPSO. Whom have we here? Whence, and what art thou? Speak. MENTOR. A suitor to your pity; a poor voyager Wreck'd on your isle, and lost (hard fate!) If you withhold protection. CALYPSO. What's thy name And nation? MENTOR. Goddess, for no less you seem, I am a Greek; Mentor, my name, the friend Of young Telemachus. CALYPSO. Where is Telemachus? Lives he? MENTOR. He lives, and sends me to implore The succours of your isle; and chief, to learn Who governs in it. CALYPSO. That do I; Calypso. I know thy charge, the son of great Ulysses: Say, to Telemachus, that he is welcome; Tell him he may approach; no danger waits him, Nor fraud, nor force, that he should fear—Away! [Exit Mentor. Now, Nymphs and Graces, your best arts prepare, String your neglected harps afresh, to love Attune your voices, ye fair sylvan choir; And in the quick'ning lustre of your eyes, Let beams of pleasure dance. Hence, to your posts! The potent charm begins; And your weak natures cannot stand the spell, Haste and avoid it. [Exeunt Nymphs. [Music. RECITATIVE, ACCOMPANIED. Imps of service, hearken! Zudore, where'er thou art, and thou, Melantho, Thogar, and Zeripon, and Fosgar, hear me! AIR. Prepare, prepare, prepare, Inhabitants of air, Ye magic ministers, prepare! [Thunder, &amp;c. So shall my potent spell Earth, seas, and winds compel. Flashing beams of Jove's own fires, [Lightnings. Ye forked shafts, retire; [They cease. Loud rattling thunders, cease; And you, that from four quarters blow, Winds, your mighty mistress know, And let the tossing billows be at peace. Enough; 'tis done! Shine forth, resplendent sun. [Lightning. Grottoes, and founts, and flowery groves, advance, As in Orphean dance; Sportive nymphs, attend your queen, And crown this soul-enchanting scene. [The rocks disappear, the stage is cloathed with woods and flowers, and the nymphs enter dancing to the air, which being concluded, they join in the following chorus. CHORUS. See, goddess, see, at thy command, Pleasures attend this happy land. CALYPSO. Break off; he comes— Telemachus enters with Mentor. Hail to the prince of Ithaca! The fame Of great Ulysses, your heroic father, Has been the herald that bespeaks your welcome. TELEMACHUS. Is it Calypso speaks? CALYPSO. I am Calypso. TELEMACHUS. I have no words, Oh, miracle of beauty, To give my wonder utterance; I am lost; A scene so fair, such forms divine surround me— Speak, Mentor, if thou canst; thou too art silent. MENTOR. Yes, but it is with indignation, prince, To see thee so possest. TELEMACHUS. If thy stern virtue Can look upon that face unmov'd, Oh, Mentor, Thou must be more or less than man—Behold. AIR. Forbear, Oh, friend severe! Whom no allurements move, When these bright forms appear, To warn me against love. Not on the rocky strand, 'Gainst which my bark was tost, But on this charming land, 'Tis here that I am lost. CALYPSO. Telemachus, what ails thy sullen friend? Old man, what wouldst thou? MENTOR. I would quit your island; These scenes accord not with a life of glory. CALYPSO. Yet here Ulysses liv'd; seven times the sun, Circling his yearly zone, still found him here: And sure Ulysses led a life of glory. MENTOR. Not in Calypso's arms. CALYPSO. Away, thou churl! Thou art some moral railer; and I know Thou hast a heart, a wishing heart, dissembler, That akes for pleasures which it cannot reach. But come, Telemachus, the bower expects thee— Give me thy hand; Calypso is thy guide: Nay, dost thou waver? Come— MENTOR. Resist, or perish. TELEMACHUS. It is in vain; I am not more than man, And she is sure a goddess. AIR. MENTOR. Fatal fall from towering height, Forfeit of immortal fame; Virtue from temptation's weight, Lab'ring droops and sinks to shame. CALYPSO By all my hopes, he sways his wavering mind With more than human power. May furies strike him! I hate, yet fear him; something awes my nature— 'Tis my last effort—Nymphs, disclose the bower! [The back scene opens and discloses the bower of Calypso luxuriantly disposed with groupes of nymphs in various attitudes. RECITATIVE. ACCOMPANIED. Look back, Telemachus; And ere you part, behold what joys You sacrifice to mad ambition. See! FINALE. (Chorus of Nymphs.) Hither, mortal, hither stray; Here are joys without decay, Love and laughter all the day, Happy mortal, come away. AIR. CALYPSO. To sport on beds of roses, Where no rude thorn opposes, And laugh at wrinkled care; Soft raptures without cloying, If these be worth enjoying, Approach and enter there. TELEMACHUS. Ah, Mentor, protect me! Ah, where shall I turn? MENTOR. To honour, to glory. TELEMACHUS. I languish, I burn; See what beauties surround me. MENTOR. Escape from the sight; When 'tis madness to struggle, there's valour in flight. CALYPSO. Ah! fly not; hear not! MENTOR. Cannot Mentor move? CALYPSO. What man would fly from happiness and love? MENTOR. Hark! Virtue calls. CALYPSO. But Pleasure bids you stay. CHORUS OF NYMPHS. Hither, Telemachus; come, come away! (Two parts with chorus.) Hark! Virtue, &amp;c. But Pleasure, &amp;c. Hither, Telemachus, &amp;c. TELEMACHUS. How can thy wounded friend depart? Ah, Mentor! urge me not to fly; Love's arrow rankles in my heart, And Love must draw it, or I die. ANTIOPE. See, Goddess, see, in his empassion'd eyes What soften'd fires, what tender tumults rise! He looks, he loves; all hail to Beauty's charms! He smiles, he sighs, he sinks into thine arms. CHORUS OF NYMPHS. He looks, he loves; all hail to Beauty's charms! He smiles, he sighs, he sinks into her arms. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Calypso's Bower. Telemachus is discovered sleeping. Mentor enters, and after surveying him sometime with fixed attention, speaks. MENTOR. He sleeps; but not as he was wont, serene, With guardian virtues hovering o'er his head; The sensual dream still haunts him; on his cheek A turbid spot of livid purple burns; The trophy which Incontinence erects Upon the tomb of Modesty. AIR. Come, magic fancy, to his aid, Set Mentor's form before his eyes, Bring his great father's awful shade; Awake, Telemachus, arise! [Exit. [Telemachus starts from sleep. RECITATIVE. TELEMACHUS. Shield me, just gods!— Who calls? Who bids Telemachus arise? Where am I? Sure it was a dream!—Ah, no. Voluptuous grotto! realiz'd disgrace! What languor seizes me? I faint, I thirst. And see the cup of pleasure mix'd by hands Immortal—Thus I seize it—Hah! it falls! AIR. See my father's ghost ascending, Beckons to the shades below; Mentor at his side attending, Awful frowns and bids me go. Here the wood nymph sweetly smiling Sinks into my vanquish'd breast; Cease, Oh, Love, this fond beguiling; Guardian powers, restore my rest! Calypso enters with her nymphs, habited for the chace. CALYPSO. Prince, to the chace. The rosy-mantled morn Stands on the summit of yond eastern hill, And calls the sportive echoes; 'tis the hour To rouse the roe-buck from his grassy laire, And sing him o'er the dew-besprinkled lawn, To the loud music of the pealing pack: My dogs are fleet, with tongues as tuneable, Chiming in concert like the muses' harps; Arise, and mount a courser fit to bear Apollo, galloping from ocean's brink Up to his mid-day throne. TELEMACHUS. Ah, leave me, goddess; In pity leave me. CALYPSO. Hence with grave remorse; Thy faculties are dull and drooping; Of mortal clay compounded: But live with us, and soon, like us, thou'lt be, Jocund and free, a spirit of delight, Without decay or death. TELEMACHUS. I'm lost again; Her power is grown resistless: My weakness, not my will, consents. CALYPSO. Nymphs of the chace, provoke Some soul-inspiring strain afresh, And rouse the joy that slumbers at his heart. AIR. Hark, the merry horns resounding, Summon to the dewy plain, While from rock to rock rebounding, Echo doubles every strain. Come, and while fresh breezes greet us, Freely o'er my island rove, Health on every hill shall meet us, Love await in every grove. Come, and this soft languor scorning, Nerve thy heart for new delight, So shall roses of the morning Flourish on the cheek of night. RECITATIVE. TELEMACHUS. Lead on, fair goddess, for my fate impels, [Exit Cal. And I must follow.—What is this? I'm lost. Some mighty conjuration shakes the grove; The trees as with a sudden earthquake fall, And choak my passage— [The grove falls suddenly between Calypso and Telemachus. Ah! what clouds are these? A sudden night surrounds me— [The stage is darkened. Help, Calypso! And guide me through this labyrinth. Ah! no; In vain; she is the mistress of the spell. An evil spirit will not help me hence, And I of all good beings am abandon'd. AIR. Forlorn I wander, and alone, In magic darkness and despair, Without a friend to hear my moan, A god to listen to my prayer. 'Tis thus when pleasure leads aside That reason which should point the way, We madly blind our faithful guide, And idly wander when we stray. [Exit. Light returns. Calypso and her Nymphs re-enter. CALYPSO. Break off your sports; Telemachus is lost. Go, wood nymphs, ransack every shady dell, Each rock or shaggy cavern, till you find him; Which if you do not, by my power I swear, I will again strip your umbrageous haunts, And desolate the isle; therefore, away! AIR. ANTIOPE AND NYMPHS. Away, away, away! Each begone without delay, Wood nymph trim or nightly say! Search the fountains, search the floods, Shadowy dales, and darkling woods; Search the grottoes, search the cells, Where the pensive Echo dwells; Nimbly pace your haunts around, Till Telemachus be found. Wood nymph trim or nightly say, Each be gone without delay; Away, away, away! [Exeunt Nymphs. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO, alone. Dæmons, you that wing the air, Hither, familiar imps, repair; Zudore, Melantho, dusky sprite, Witching minister of night, Hither on leathern pinions sail, Ye flitting phantoms! Zudore enters. RECITATIVE. ZUDORE. Mistress, hail! RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Welcome, Zudore, whence come you? RECITATIVE. ZUDORE. From the horned moon I flew, Plumb as fathom line I fell, Down and down. Have I done well? RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Well done, my nimble spirit! Welcome both, I was about to tax your sloth, Fosgar and Zeripon! Fosgar and Zeripon enter. RECITATIVE. FOSGAR. Not so, dread queen! Nor lazy servitors, I ween, Are thy prompt imps. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Where were you found? RECITATIVE. ZERIPON. In sulphureous pit profound Of bellowing Ætna, whom beneath Rebel giants lie and breath; Fiery sighs, that to the last Shake Olympus with the blast. Melantho and two Dæmons enter. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Where have you loitered, lazy thing? And you, and you? RECITATIVE. MELANTHO. We've beat the wing With meteor's speed from field of blood, Where Troy's renowned city stood. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. What did you there? RECITATIVE. MELANTHO. We glean'd the plain For bones of Grecian heroes slain; These compounded, make a charm, Shall keep Telemachus from harm. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Ye forward elves, how did you dare Unbidden amulets prepare? Rather, ye sprites, provide a spell To sink him to the shades of hell. Meantime begone, and search around, Till the false, fickle youth be found; Spread your swift pinions and begone, Then frolick, Dæmons, when your task is done. [Exit. AIR. DÆMONS. Brothers, we must beat the wing Till the winnow'd welkin sing, Up and down, and round and round, Hovering o'er the untouch'd ground. Chorus. Up and down, &amp;c. Raven, bat, and owl, have rest, We must do our queen's behest; Wet and weary we must scout, Night and day about, about. Chorus. Wet and weary, &amp;c. Spirits, now no more delay, Up and brush the winds away: Tasking done and trouble past, Hey for holiday at last. Chorus. Tasking done, &amp;c. [They vanish. Telemachus is met by Antiope. AIR. ANTIOPE. Welcome, young and favour'd lover, Joyful I arrest my prize; Come, thou false provoking rover, Come, and heal Calypso's sighs. Through the vale and o'er the mountain, Weary steps I've trod in vain, Every grotto, every fountain, Trac'd it o'er and o'er again. Mortal, what is filial duty? What are virtue's stately charms? When celestial love and beauty, Tempt thee to Calypso's arms? TELEMACHUS. Name her not to me; too, too long already Has that soft syren mesh'd me in her snares: I pr'ythee, wood-nymph, if thy heart e'er felt The sense of pity; if the holy name Of chastity e'er sounded in thine ear, Compel me not by any devilish arts To your dire goddess, and that hellish banquet, At which last night I revell'd—Oh, last night! ANTIOPE. Mortal, your supplication through my heart Ascends to heav'n; there is a grace in modesty, Which ev'n the ministers of vice revere: You are here enthrall'd by a most fell enchantress; The cup, which to your lips she tender'd, holds, Though mantling bright, pollution's foulest drugs; Taste, taste not, I conjure thee; th'island swarms With magic spirits on the wing to find thee; Farther to counsel thee exceeds my powers: But here at hand there dwells a mighty prophet, Potent in word and deed; to him I hasten, If haply by his art the means may offer To snatch thee from perdition close impending. [Exit. AIR. TELEMACHUS. With bended knee and bleeding heart, Great gods, I ask your saving aid; Daughter of Jove, thy grace impart, Minerva, wise and martial maid! If I, like my unhappy sire, Must languish in this fatal place; Ah, strike me quick with Jove's own fire, And give me death, but not disgrace! [Exit. Calypso's Grotto. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Telemachus, where art thou? Lost Calypso! Scorn'd, though a goddess; though immortal, curst: Father and son—by both am I deserted. Oh, insupportable! give me revenge: Some friendly god assist me! If there's a power in heav'n, earth, sea, or air, To whom revenge is dear, I do invoke That power to aid me—Hah! methinks I see The grotto shake— And hark: soft music breathes—What may this be? AIR. Tuneful spirits of the air, If your spell can chace despair, Welcome to my ear your strain, Strike, Oh, strike it o'er again. But if still the scornful boy, Slights my love, and mocks my joy, Imps of hell, your aid supply; Torturing furies, let him die! RECITATIVE. PROTEUS unseen. Calypso, goddess, hear! RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Speak, whosoe'er thou art, Calypso hears. AIR. PROTEUS as before. Follow, goddess, follow me! To the margin of the sea, Thou shalt soon transported be. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. I hear, but nothing see. Who art thou? AIR. PROTEUS as before. To the grot if thou'lt repair, Welcome form shall meet thee there; See, the serpent shows thee where. [Proteus crosses the stage in the form of a serpent, and enters Calypso's grotto. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Serpent, whoe'er thou art, or god or dæmon, I do adjure thee take thy proper form, And in that form appear! [Proteus comes forth from the grotto. AIR. PROTEUS. Goddess of Ogygia's land, Proteus comes at thy command; I am he, whose mimic shape, Every living thing can ape; I can fly and I can run: Goddess, speak, and it is done. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Thanks, son of Neptune, but I ask Of Proteus no laborious task; Nor run, nor fly; but teach the art, To fix a wavering lover's heart: Give me a spell, that may inspire Telemachus with new desire. RECITATIVE. PROTEUS. Ask this of me? Away! methought Experience might have better taught: To shew where finest sea-shells are, Or string thee pearls to deck thy hair; Bring coral to adorn thy bower, Or softest moss to strew the floor; These I can do, but to controul, Or warp from truth one virtuous soul, Not all the powers of darkest hell, Own such a diabolic spell. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Hah! have I then, ungrateful god, Conceded a secure abode To thee and to thy scaly fry; (Oh, much abused courtesy!) And wilt not thou at utmost need Assist me (false in word and deed!) Go then with all thy fishy train, I drive thee forth to sea again! FINALE. AIR. CALYPSO. Rage, disappointment, love, despair, With different pangs my bosom tear, And make me loath the day: Ah, think how short The hours of sport, How long the moments of delay. AIR. PROTEUS. Beside the hoarse-resounding deep, Lay me, kind gods, in senseless sleep, Rather then let me live to prove The piercing agonies of hopeless love. Enter Calypso's Nymphs. CHORUS OF NYMPHS. Hail, goddess, hail! let hills and vales resound With joyful shouts—Telemachus is found. CALYPSO. Revenge, revenge, for my neglected charms! CHORUS. Ah, spare him, goddess! CALYPSO. Love my heart alarms— CHORUS. For pity spare him— PROTEUS. Take him to thine arms. CALYPSO. Revenge, revenge! PROTEUS. Revenge and love controul The varying movements of her tortur'd soul. CHORUS. For pity spare him— CALYPSO. Love my heart alarms— CHORUS. Ah, spare him, goddess, take him to thine arms! Enter Dæmons. AIR. DÆMONS. Shout and dance and run the ring, Joyful evidence we bring; Young Telemachus is here, Lover lost, appear, appear! [They vanish. Enter Telemachus. AIR. CALYPSO. In young Telemachus I trace The strength of Mars, Apollo's grace; The eye of Jove, Minerva's tongue, And bloom of Bacchus ever young. Like feather'd Mercury he moves, And soft as Cytherea's doves: Yet, ah, while all these charms I see, I find no heart for love and me. Enter Antiope. ANTIOPE. Goddess, spare the hapless youth, Spare his innocence and truth. CALYPSO. Traitress, away! ANTIOPE. —Yet hear me. CALYPSO. No. ANTIOPE. Awful goddess, say not so. TELEMACHUS. Ah, what languor weighs me down! Help me, gods, I sink, I swoon— [He sinks into the arms of Calypso. ANTIOPE. See, he falls! Oh, Proteus, join, Assist my suit, and I am thine. PROTEUS. And shall it be said, ye immortals so blest, Such malice had place in a goddess's breast? Ah, lovely Calypso, release the fond boy, And the victim you've conquer'd, forbear to destroy. CALYPSO. Awake, awake! unfold your eyes! TELEMACHUS. Alas, what ghastly spectres rise! My father's frowning shade appears, And Mentor bath'd in virtuous tears. RECITATIVE. NYMPHS. Before his spectre-haunted eyes, His friends, his father's forms arise; But, ah, false forms, they rise in vain, She smiles, and he is lost again. CHORUS. But, ah! false forms, they rise in vain, She smiles, and he is lost again. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE the sea-shore, with the cave of Proteus. Proteus and Antiope. RECITATIVE. PROTEUS. This feather, pluck'd from plumy wing Of Jove's own bird, these flowers of spring Fresh crop'd, with euphrasy and rue, Thrice dip'd in Heliconian dew, A wond'rous amulet comprize To clear the film from mortal eyes. Here, wood nymph, strike this magic bough, With hand immortal, o'er the brow Of charmed youth, and, strange to tell! 'Twill instantly disperse the spell; With his purg'd eyes, he strait shall see Calypso, as she ought to be. RECITATIVE. ANTIOPE. Henceforth may never hurt or harm Approach thee or thy fishy swarm! May thy sea-horses never more Be tempest-driven upon the shore! And ever-changing may'st thou be, Still pleas'd with sweet variety. Enter Mentor. MENTOR. Turn, wood nymph, and thou son of Neptune, stay! AIR. PROTEUS. Awful being, deign to say, What it is that bars my way, Man or god? And tell me why Dwells such terror in thine eye? Every form which heav'n can make I of late had power to take; Trembling now, aghast I stand, Aw'd by some superior hand. Cold, cold blood from every part Gathers round my sinking heart; Terror beats in every vein, Immortality is pain. RECITATIVE. MENTOR. Whate'er I am more than I seem, Oh, Proteus! To thee and to this wood nymph I must bear Friendly affection; you have seal'd a peace With the offended gods; these flowers medicinal Of spell-dispersing quality I take, And wave them thus and thus. Now, wood nymph, turn And view thy lover. Is he not more pleasing? RECITATIVE. ANTIOPE. Can this be Proteus? Oh, surprizing change! RECITATIVE. PROTEUS. Where, and what am I? Sure my pendent locks, Which hung like icicles upon the ribs Of wintry Caucasus, grow crisp and curl'd; My shaggy beard is gone, and my chin feels Like young Apollo's, soft as cygnet's down; And look, the wood nymph, once so chilling cold, Now with warm glances smiles. Oh, for a mirror To view myself withal. RECITATIVE. ANTIOPE. Ah! how is this! What have you done? I feel, Oh, great magician! I feel a throbbing; 'tis not pain, methinks; Yet, if a pleasure, such an one it is As borrows something of its opposite. Wou'd I were such, Oh, Proteus! in thine eyes, As thou art now in mine! RECITATIVE. PROTEUS. Fair thou wert ever; But beauty so serene, such modest graces, Till now I saw not. RECITATIVE. MENTOR. The protecting spirit, Who guards Telemachus, hath wrought this change; And now escape from this devoted isle; Haste to the shore; attending tritons there Shall welcome you rejoicing, and conduct To the bright scene prepar'd for your espousals: Farewel—be happy: only this remember, Proteus must change no more. [Exit. AIR. ANTIOPE. Joyful I hear the fix'd decree, That thou no more must change. PROTEUS. Ah, tell me, thus possessing thee, Can Proteus wish to range? PROTEUS AND ANTIOPE. Come then, and e'er it be too late, Fly this devoted shore, Whilst sad Calypso meets her fate, And falls to rise no more. [Exeunt. Calypso's Grotto. Calypso and Telemachus. AIR. CALYPSO. Ah, truant, how cruel your pride, In my sighs such enjoyment to take; And sure, if death were not denied, You wou'd see me expire for your sake. Come, smile then, and give me your hand; Ah, scorner, can this be too much? I sue, when I ought to command, And approach, while you fly from my touch. Are all the fine things that are told Of my beauty, but tales to deceive? Or is your heart frozen and cold? Say, which must Calypso believe? TELEMACHUS. I'll not approach your grotto. I renounce Joys, which are purchas'd with the mind's content. CALYPSO. Know I have power to make those joys immortal; To give thee the perpetual bloom of youth, Or misery to the extent of time. TELEMACHUS. I'll not believe it; there are guardian spirits Commission'd on the part of suffering virtue, And I appeal to them. Lo, where I turn From your false isle, and all its seeming joys. Farewel, Calypso! Flatt'ring, treacherous ruin! AIR. Hence with pleasure, love and beauty, Flowery paths that lead astray. Welcome labour, toil and duty; Lights, that point the glorious way. Mentor enters from another part of the scene, and as Telemachus is departing, recalls him. MENTOR. Turn, turn, brave youth! your conquest is complete, The tempter flies, your guardian friend returns, A smiling train of happy days succeeds: Away for Ithaca—your father lives— Nay, doubt not—Hark! applauding thunder rolls; Great Jove assents and ratifies the doom. [Thunder. TELEMACHUS. Auspicious omen, hail! I do perceive I am the care of some superior being; But what I know not. Oh, protecting spirit, How shall I go? Thy power I cannot doubt; But yet no bark I see to bear me hence From this lone island: all is sea around me. MENTOR. True, all is sea around you, and no bark With ready sails presents itself to waft you From this lone isle; yet if Telemachus Hath constancy, he still shall be preserv'd. AIR. Of all this gay but guilty round, One solid rock shall stand alone; So Pleasure sinks, while Virtue's found At rest on the perpetual stone. Now, son of Reason, take thy choice, Pleasures to follow or to fly; Hear Wisdom's call in Mentor's voice, Or drink Calypso's cup and die. TELEMACHUS. Instruct me how to act; behold me ready For any deed thy wisdom may direct. MENTOR. Enough! then know thy guardian is Minerva. Nay, rise, Telemachus! See'st thou the cliff That beetles o'er yond fathomless abyss? TELEMACHUS. What would'st thou, mighty Power? I see the cliff. MENTOR. If thou dar'st plunge into the frowning flood From this tremendous height, attending tritons Shall to thy native Ithaca transport thee, And carol strains of triumph o'er the waves. Farewel; believe, obey me, and be bless'd. [Exit. AIR. TELEMACHUS. Great Pow'r, who from this guilty isle To thy bright sphere dost reascend, Ah, deign to give one parting smile, And chear thy sad and drooping friend. Hail, gracious vision! to the deep My mortal part I freely throw, And rush from the impending steep, Nor fear the watery death below. [Exit. Enter Calypso, alone. RECITATIVE. Death to my hopes! Come, dæmons all, Assemble at your sovereign's call. How now, familiars, have you sped? Sluggards, you move with heels of lead. What shakes you? Who your charm has crost? The Dæmons enter mournfully. FIRST DÆMON. Alas, for pity, we are lost: Some power unknown delights to thwart The efforts of our magic art. CALYPSO. Base things, 'tis false; the only fault Is in your natures. Open, vault, And take them in! [The vault opens. RECITATIVE. FIRST DÆMON. Ah, close the cave, And save us, mighty mistress, save! RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. Will you then work, and work it well, A stronger yet a stronger spell? His stubborn virtue to controul, And force my passage to his soul: This done, not even the winds shall be, Than you, more frolic or more free. RECITATIVE. FIRST DÆMON. Now, spirits, to your work apply; I have a spell— RECITATIVE. SECOND DÆMON. And I— RECITATIVE. THIRD DÆMON. And I. AIR. FIRST DÆMON. I have the wonder-working stone That faithful wooes the north alone; With sultry blast that fans the flame In melting breast of Lybian dame. SECOND DÆMON. I've tangles of Queen Dido's hair, Rent in the frenzy of despair; These with the dog-star's rage shall move The embers of expiring love. THIRD DÆMON. I have the very nerve that hung Sinon's false persuasive tongue; I have the wanton dimples sleek That bask'd in Helen's truant cheek. FOURTH DÆMON. I've jelly, caught from stars that fell, By force of love-provoking spell; And drops from Venus' tresses wrung, When from the Cyprian wave she sprung. FIFTH DÆMON. I've gleanings of Hesperian fruit, With rank Satyrion's guilty root; These, with the hot Hispanian fly, Shall make his languid pulse beat high. CALYPSO. Ye have enough. Spirits, be stout. The charm is full. About, about! [Exit Cal. Each spirit, after reciting his spell, throws something into the cauldron, in the back scene, and retires. When the whole is performed, they all form a circle round it, crouching and squatting on their hams, stirring the flame at the same time; till Mentor appears, on whose coming they instantly start up. RECITATIVE. MENTOR. How now, malicious things! how do you dare, With your vile drugs, prophane the wholesome air? What is't you do? RECITATIVE. FIRST DÆMON. Ah, mighty Sir! we know You can controul our doings, and we bow To your superior power; but be our friend, We'll do you faithful service without end. RECITATIVE. MENTOR. Dark are your deeds, and darkness be your doom, Enter the cave, your everlasting tomb. AIR. Howl, howl amain, ye ghastly crew, Drink with parch'd lips your dungeon's dew; Wash the hard rock with streaming eyes, And rend your cave with piercing cries. CHORUS OF DÆMONS. Dread being, protect us; Ah, pity our pain, Release us from bondage, and loose us again! MENTOR. No being protects you, nor pities your pain; No power to all time shall release you again. [They enter the cave which closes upon them. Enter Calypso hastily. CALYPSO. Now, spirits, have you done? MENTOR. Forever. CALYPSO. Mentor! MENTOR. Yes, Mentor. CALYPSO. Wretch, how have you dar'd? MENTOR. Sorceress, be still! your power is at an end; Your dæmons are entombed here for ever, And all your spells dissolv'd. CALYPSO. I'll call the winds, And from its centre shake the solid isle: I'll have a charm that shall provoke the thunder, And launch Jove's fires on the audacious heads Of meddling mortals. MENTOR. Peace, and hear me, goddess, If you presume thus with enchanting spells, And magic incantations, to approach me: You then your great superior shall behold In terror, and your bold presumption rue. [Exit. CALYPSO alone. He's gone, and I revive— Inglorious thought—thus to be baffled: no: I will pursue, or perish. Hah, Minerva! As Calypso is going out, Minerva appears and opposes the Ægis. RECITATIVE. CALYPSO. The dreadful Ægis flashes in my eyes Horrid confusion. Cover me, ye hills, Fall on me, groves; or you, ye clouds, descend And hide me from her sight! Oh, vengeful goddess, I do implore thee to withdraw thy terrors, Or in the milder change of Mentor's form, Appear, and do thy will— [Minerva disappears. Thanks, mighty power! The direful vision's vanish'd—She is gone: And see, she comes again in human shape, But still with brow severe. Enter Mentor conducting Telemachus. RECITATIVE. MENTOR. Now hear your doom. This isle, which you and your voluptuous train Have made the seat of sinful pleasures, sinks, With all its grottos, founts, and flowery groves, Down to the unfathom'd bottom of the ocean, Nay, to th'indignant center. See, 'tis falling! [A crash is heard as of falling of buildings. All, all must down, save one drear desart rock Thy ruin's monument. Descend! For earth and heaven renounce thee. AIR. CALYPSO. Ah! me, I sink—All cheering sun, farewel! And you, sweet Phœbe, pleasure's better light! Banish'd Calypso now, alas! must dwell In scenes of sorrow with perpetual night. [She sinks. As Calypso is sinking, the scene vanishes, and the magnificent palace of Proteus, with its proper emblems and decorations, ascends. Proteus and Antiope are seated on a chrystal throne: the sea nymphs range on one side, and the tritons on the other. After a prelude, the following strain, with chorusses, is performed. FINALE. CHORUS. Hail, happy scene, resplendent cave! That glitters through the glassy wave, Proteus, our king, returns from earth, And gives this festival to mirth. SEA NYMPHS. Whilst here the chrystal waves beneath, Through vocal reeds we softly breathe, Tritons, your deep-ton'd shells prepare, And caroll the responsive air! CHORUS. Hail, happy scene. TRITONS. Prepare, ye fathers of the flood, Loud welcomes for the coming god, Let your glad triumphs spread around, And shake with joy the deep profound. CHORUS. Hail, happy scene. ANTIOPE. Proteus and you, who o'er the briny tide, Tritons and nymphs, in scaly squadrons glide, Your hymeneal strains awhile suspend, And mark the moral of Calypso's end; Happy, thrice happy must our union prove, When sage Minerva guides the shaft of love. PROTEUS. Telemachus regains his native coast, Whilst with her sinking isle Calypso's lost; Of all her train one virtuous nymph alone Remains to share my heart, and grace my throne: Our bliss, no envious dæmon can destroy, When crown'd by wisdom in the arms of joy. GRAND CHORUS. Their bliss no envious dæmon can destroy, When crown'd by wisdom in the arms of joy. FINIS.</field>
