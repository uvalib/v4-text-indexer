      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Haymarket. The Lord Moreton Mr. Selby Beauchamp, his Friend Mr. J. Vining Maynard, a Merchant Mr. Haines Hargrave, his Brother-in-law Mr. Elton, Mr. Vandenhoff Drawer Mr. Bishop Mrs. Maynard Miss E. Phillips Mrs. Hargrave Miss Ellen Tree Madame De Grave Mrs. W. Clifford Servants, Officers, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">COSTUME. Lord MoretonâDoublet and loose breeches of crimson velvet richly embroidered, cloak to match lined with white, high topped yellow boots, point lace at the knees and tops of boots, black high hat, white plume, BeauchampâDress of similar fashion, green velvet and amber. HargraveâPuce cloth doublet, breeches, and cloak, slightly trimmed with amber, high russet boots without lace, drab hat, black feather. MaynardâGrey cloth doublet and breeches with black velvet trimming, black shoes and rosettes. Drawer and ServantsâPlain doublet and breeches. Mrs. MaynardâGrey silk open-bodied gown, white petticoat. Mrs. HargraveâWhite muslin dress of similar fashion. Madame de GraveâHandsome amber satin open bodied gown white satin petticoat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âA Room in Maynard's House. Enter Maynard, Mrs. Maynard, and Hargrave, R. H. May. Leave us! do you hear the man? Mary, speak to him: These high-flown fancies are beyond the reach Of a plain merchant, like myself: speak to him. Mrs. M. Dear brother, be persuaded. Let not pride, The weakness of great natures, and of mean ones The poor disguise, find entrance in your bosom, Displacing worthier inmates. Still be just To us who love you, and your own noble heart: We know what you would say; leave it unsaid,â And what you really think us, shew indeed, By liberal acquiescence. Har. My dear sister,â And Maynard, trusty and most trusted friend, Lend me a moment's patience. Full two years Have we been shelter'd by your roof, partaken Your hospitable board, shar'd your free purse, And for all benefits, of word, or deed, Or of those nameless courtesies that make The vital air of friendship, have been still Your grateful debtors: well, but hear me, Maynard. I have beseech'd, nay, have besieg'd the Council, That they would lend an ear to my just claims; I would recover my estate,â'tis mine As truly as the King's crown his,âby blood; Blood which was shed, and freely, in his cause. My claims are not allow'd; well, what remains? I cannot stay with you: too long already Have I been wrapp'd in a deceitful hope, Which is now worn to a shred: my sword alone Must help me now, and it points out a road To honourable service. May. When we see The road you speak of, will I stay you? No. Like a tir'd host I'll show you to the door, Aye, hold the stirrup for you, and with smiles Bid you good speed. Look you, proud Captain Hargrave:â Seated once more in your estate, which yet I must believe you will be, and once more First of the shire, with your broad lands before you, O'er which the crow flies wearily to roost, On your old tree-tops, you may hug your pride As closely as you will, but here you shall not. Har. Maynard, it is not prideâ May. I'll warrant now, Should fortune suddenly with one hand raise you, And with the other thrust me to the earth,â And shou'd your sister here, and I, come to you, With piteous tale of bankruptcy and ruin, You would receive us with cool scornânay, bid us Trace back the path we came. Har. You do not think so: You know me better, Maynard. Mrs. M. He but jestsâ Forgive him, brother. May. What, then, you would house us? You'd entertain us for a month, a year, Would you?âa longer time, perhaps? Har. For ever,â Or were I not the vilest slave alive. What! could I see my sister and yourself In want, and I in want of heart to serve you,â To bid you welcome to my house and lands, And ask you share them? Sir, you wrong me. May. Well, then: What pride is this that takes not, but must give; And, asking sufferance for the thing it is, Denies it to another. Come, no moreâ I shall be angry else. Har. But one wordâ May. No. Mrs. M. I was about to quench this friendly heat, But here comes one, shall, like a gentle air, Extinguish it at once. Enter Mrs. Hargrave, R. H. May. Ha! Madam, welcome. You're come in time: your husband here and I, Cannot yet understand each others' hearts, And were about to call our tongues to witness That we were fools alike. Mrs. H. But let me hope, No serious disagreement has occurr'd: Some trifle, surely,âwhat is it? May. Why, nothing. And since we cannot make it less, I'll even See to my books and bales: come with me, wife. Hargrave, no more of thatâ Har. Well, be it so. [Exeunt Mr. and Mrs. Maynard, L. H. Mrs. H. But what has chanc'd 'twixt you and Maynard, Henry? Har. An amicable contest,ânothing more. The worthy fellow and my sister urge Our longer stay with them, and will, perforce Insist upon it,âyet I like it not. Mrs. H. Wherefore? they love you, and respect us both; Feel not what you feel, know not you should feel it, Nor need your thanks, their hearts have thank'd them for us. Har. Why, it is true,âand yet I like it not. Oh, Margaret, I am weary of this state Of voluntary bondage, drudging still To do the work of patience, which exacts Yet never satisfies:âthe clouds around us Thicken, and threaten tempest. Mrs. H. Yet, be sure, A light will soon break through to cheer you on. Har. Aye, so it does sometimes,âbut does not cheer me. 'Tis like the beam shot from a clouded moon, Borrow'd,âand spent on darkness. There's not a beggar, Whose only hopes are sunshine and a crust, But has a stronger purchase on his fate Than I have, Margaret. Mrs. H. You must not say so. Think of the childrenâ Har. And yourselfâI do so: And that it is which presses on my heart: But, pardon me, this is the idleness That comes of hope deferr'd. Enter Maynard, L. H. May. I am here again, You see: my zeal outruns my manners often. I have brought a letter for you, left but now By a tall stripling pageâa budding courtier Putting forth smiles and bows. The seal is noble, And has a look of promise with it. Take itâ My life on't, it will banish megrim, Hargrave. Har. (Takes the letter.) I will retire and read May. By your favour, I claim friends' privilege, and mean to be As curious in the business that concerns Yourself, as though 'twere mine: so, let me hear it. What say you, madam? [To Mrs. Hargrave.] Mrs. H. Certainly. Har. You shall. [Hargrave reads.] âTo the right valiant Captain Hargrave.â Um! 'Tis a fair superscription,âfortune grant So honour'd a commencement be not marr'd Ere we arrive at its conclusion. [Opens letter and reads. âSir,âI have heard of your claims, which I am advised are valid, and of your noble bearing in the late war, which, were they otherwise, should make them so. I have interest in a certain quarter (not to be here named) which shall, I think, stand you in sufficient stead. Will you pleasure me by an interview at the Dolphin, over against Paul'sâwhere we shall talk of this matter. I await you there; and meanwhile, must make bold to call myself your friend. Moreton.â May. Why, this is well: who said that hope had died And left no heir? I knew your time would come, Though, to say truth, it has been slow of foot. Har. I have heard of the Lord Moreton. May. Who has not? He is the Earl of Belmont's only son; One of the larger planets of the court, Receiving light from Charles, which he in turn Dispenses unto others; now, dispatch,â Go to him, and partake his beams. Har. If justice Must be awak'd by the soft tones that flow Out of a courtier's mouth, and will not listen To my plain speech, well,âbe it so,âenough That truth is spoken,âand besides, my hopes Have ground to tread on nowâfor 'twas at Naseby I sav'd the life of the Lord Moreton's father. May. For which the son shall owe you thanks, and pay In more substantial coin. Come, get ye gone, We long for your return. Mrs. H. I always said, Fortune would make amends. Har. And so you did. And for your sake, dear wife, your prophecy Must be made good but I am gone. Farewell. [Exit Hargrave, L. H. May. My wife must hear of this: during his absence We'll steal a march on time, and know beforehand How he intends to raise us. Mrs. H. And I hope Conjecture will be speedy certainty. May. You shall not doubt it. [Exeunt. R. H. SCENE II. âA Room in the Dolphin Tavern. Enter Lord Moreton and Beauchamp, R. H. Servants arrange Chairs. More. Wine, hereâsome of your oldest. Should a gentleman Desire to see me, let him be admitted. [Exit Drawer.] [To Beauchamp.] I do not altogether like your plan. Beau. Why not? More. 'Tis easy, when we have stolen the prize, To render compensation,âgone, 'tis valueless. Beau. Who steals when he may purchase? you mistake: The value of a thing, when it is gone, If not indeed enhanc'd, suggests a price More than its worth: steal but a worthless pebble, The owner swears it was a diamond. Cannot we test the man? if he be flaw'd, You gain your point at once. More. If not? Beau. You stand In a position better than before. He cannot say but you have fairly warn'd him, But do not deem him so inflexible; I never yet knew man, but poverty Could bend him. Once I kept a pride myself,â But it was too expensive, so we parted. More. Beauchamp, I think you do not know the man. This Hargrave is a soldier, and a brave one, Who serv'd, while yet a boy, at Nottingham With Rupertâfought, a very devil, at Edgehill, And left two horses dead on Chaldgrave field. Espousing the King's cause, it seems, unfledg'd, This bird forsook his patrimonial nest, Which some full-feathered Roundhead still enjoys. He, meanwhile, comes to London, plies the Council, Nay, even the King himself, for restitution, Or failing that, for some equivalent In shape of office, money, or commission, Which, between us, he scarce will get; for Charlesâ Whom Heaven preserveâpreserves such claims for Heaven; And so with heart-sick hope the man still pines. Beau. My lord, there seems no difficulty here. He is a soldierâis he poor?â More. He is,â Beau. As pride can make him, doubtless; which ne'er plunges A man into a slough, but she still leaves him For meanness to draw forth. Make yourself easy; Hargrave may bluster for a while, but, trust me, His noisy sense of wrong will soon subside, Lull'd by your golden music. More. He shall have it,â And freely, too. Beau. Well, you are generous: It saves sometimes a world of after-trouble. Enter Drawer, R. H. with Wine, &amp;c. Draw. My lord, one Master Hargraveâ More. Let him come up. [Exit Drawer.] He's here. [To Beau.] Beau. Leave him to meâI'll cast the plummet, And sound the depths and shallows of his soul, Though it were turbid as an autumn flood. More. Softly:âhe comes. Enter Hargrave, R. H. Har. Lord Moreton?â More. I am he. My friend, and yours. [Introduces Beauchamp.] Let us be seated:âCome, sir. [They sit.] You'll pardon my presumption, Captain Hargrave, But I have long been anxious for the honour Of knowing youâyour name I have long known. Let me be plain:âthe little interest That I can fairly boast, when it is join'd To the commanding influence of others,â As 'tis now join'dâsupported by your claims, Which justice cannot wink at, must avail you;â Nay, shallâI think soâlet us not be sanguine, And so miscount our strength. [Turning to Beauchamp.] 'Sdeath! is it not A hard case, that a noble gentleman, One who has serv'd his king, should be forgotten, Whilst others, aliens to fame and honour, Are but too well remember'd? Beau. So it is. More. But, doubt not, I shall raise you,âif not so high As your deserts, yet to the eminence You fell fromâor from which you were displac'd. Har. I am much bound to you. More. Nay,ânot at all. Meanwhile, for restitution travels slowly, Even at its fastest, pray command my purseâ Let me request you will acceptâ[Offers Hargrave a purse.] Har. My lord! I seek not almsâ More. Pshaw!âneither do I think so, Or tender it as suchâbut, from a friendâ Har. I should be loth to baulk your generous nature By any show of an unseemly humour, As though I should disdain or slight an act Prompted by friendship, butâ More. You are too proud. No? then accept this loanâfor 'tis a loan,â Which some not distant day you shall return. Har. Well, my lord, I thank you. More. Put it up: that's well. No more of it. [Moreton and Beauchamp exchange glances.] For a few minutes' space, I fear that I must leave you. I am bound To meet a certain Duke, whom to engage In your affairs, (and he is apt, I know) Is now my present aim. Beauchamp, to you I leave our friend: you'll entertain him, will you? I shall be hither straight. Beau. We shall expect you. [Exit Moreton, R. H. Come, Captain, let us sit: this wine must not Grow older ere we taste it. [He pours out wine.] What say you, sir? His Lordship is a very noble fellow, One who will wear a coronet as proudly As his old father, and not dim its brightness. Let us, then, pledge his health. Har. With all my heart. [They drink.] Beau. But yet this stripling has his faults of nature, Which to us older men suggest a smile, Remembering when we ourselves were younger. He's of the court, where licence is the rule, And pleasure, Fortune's Ganymede, attends With an o'erbrimming goblet. Har. Let him quaff it. Better these idle vanities of sense To know, than to avoid; their emptiness Once seen, the real blessings that invite us Are worthier priz'd. Beau, True: but this young gallant. Shot through by a bright eye, is quite destroy'd. Why, sir, the memory of a smile will last him For months to swear by:âhe is too weak in this. Har. It is almost the privilege of youth To be so: 'tis a giddy flame, whose fire Will one day burn more clear, and warm, and steadfast. Beau. You are married, Captain Hargrave. Har. I have a wife, sir. Beau. She's fair:âoh, what a term is that for beautyâ A very angel, Captain! Har. She will pass; And might, indeed, be deem'd a very angel, Were all to judge as you,âfrom mere surmise. Beau. But I have seen her. Har. Ha! Beau. And he has seen herâ My lordâ Har. Indeed! Beau. Why, how you look! what marvel? She's beautiful, and we had eyes to see it: There is nought strange in that. But, come, more wine. This is much nearer to my heart than beauty. [They drink.] Be not offended, sir, when I e'en tell you, That we have spoken with her. Har. Sir! you're merry. I hope so. Beau. No. Har. You jest. Beau. No, by my lifeâ As serious as a straight-haired Puritan. But, what! you look disturb'd. Har. No,ânot at all. Yet it is strange. Beau. Well, to accost a lady In the open street is rude, I grant;ânot strange, In these timesâand we knew not 'twas your wife. Har. But now that you do know itâ Beau. There's the plague! Moreton, poor wretch! must sigh, and sigh in vain. Har. I do not understandâwhat do you mean? Beau. Shall I be frank with you? Har. I shall like it best, 'Tis as I speak sometimesâa soldier's trick. Beau. Well, then: I have conceiv'd a friendship for you, Born of your praise, which, to say truth, his lordship Makes his still constant theme: and if strong zeal Had ready tools to work with, and could act On pliable materials, he'd serve you. But he, I think, miscalculates his power; Rather, mis rates the patient tedious skill, Whereby right must be wrested from the strong, Who, having, keep,âthough it belong to others. Well, he is young, capriciousâyou or I, Might seek and press him strong in your behalf, Just on the heel of some rebuff;âhe'd chafeâ Conceive disgustâperhaps throw up the office He undertook in friendship:âsee you not? Now, if your wifeâ Har. Ayeâ Beau. You were about to speak? Har. I said but âayeââproceed. Beau. Well, if your wife Would undertake to move in this affairâ (Persuasion is a woman's element), Would sue him every hour;âshould he relax, Urge him more warmlyâin a word, o'ercome him; Beauty has done this oft, and Mistress Hargrave Will meet an easy conquest in my lord, Who is already vanquish'd by her eyes. [During this speech Hargrave has risen, and paces the Stage. [Aside.] He has taken the bait! Captain, are you not well? Har. A sudden giddinessâthe wine has flush'd meâ I shall be better soonâ [Hargrave seats himself, and after a pause speaks. You think so? Beau. What? Har. That were my wife to mediateâto go Between us, as you say, 'twere better thanâ Beau. Than you or I, or any other man. I have heard him hint, indeed, that did you please, You need not fear advancement. Har. How? Beau. Guess. Har. I cannot. Beau. Your wifeâ Har. Ha, ha! I see; you know the worldâ Wiseâwise: will it be long ere he return? Beau. He stays too long already; when he comes You can speak to him. Har. I can speak to him? True: I will speak to him. Beau. Oh! here he is. Enter Moreton, R. H. More. You have not miss'd me, gentlemen, I hope. I was detain'd. Har. Oh, but, my lord, we have. Your hand, my lord. More. With pleasure. Har. Take that again. [Drops the purse into the hand of Moreton And seek some man whom fortune has depriv'd Of all, save what she could not takeâhis honour: Tempt him with thatâbid high, and you may win him: If he prove obstinate as some men will be Who have a feeling on that scoreâbid higherâ Be liberal with your gold, and when you've won him, Bring him to me, and I will spit upon him. More. What mystery is here? why this to me? What is the meaning, Beauchamp, of this phrenzy? Beau. What! Captainâ Har. Oh, you are there? Come hither. [Hargrave seizes Beauchamp and leads him to Moreton Who is this creature you have left with me? What wretch is this? You said he was your friendâ Your friend? More. He is. Har. Dishonourable boy! How I blush for you, that you do not blush. Have you no shameâno thoughtâfeeling or fearâ That you thus dare to put this outrage on me? When next you'd have a serpent do your baseness, Chose not a wormâa trailing worm like this. [Thrusts Beauchamp from him. More. You're insolent! I wear a swordâ Har. I use oneâ And sometimes quickly. Do not tempt me. Hence! Beau. [To More.] Let us be gone. You must not quarrel with him; It may be dangerous. By Heaven! I thought The man was our's. More. Unhand me, Beauchamp! now Will I chastise this mouthing blusterer, Whose threats are his chief danger. Har. Hear me, sirâ I have been, if I am not now, a soldier, And have withstood the iron men of Fairfax; Rush'd mid the thick of death, where I have heard Red carnage bowl for blood, which all the while Was peopling heaven with soulsâand would you stop me What reed next for a weapon? I have spokenâ Begone! Beau. (To Moreton.) He is not worthy of your sword: Leave him; we shall yet find the means to cross him. More. Nay, I will notâ Har. Touch but your sword-hilt, Lord, Advance one stepâbut oneâand the next moment Shall see your father childless. Be advis'dâ Take council of your friendâonce it may serve you. Beau. Come, you must hence. More. You're right. I was too hasty. [To Hargrave.] You shall hear of me, sir again. Har. Well, well: When I hear of your courage, time enoughâ You may be older then. [Beauchamp forces Moreton out, R. H. I was a fool to vent myself upon A trivial boy like this. Oh, Poverty! The roof of thatchâthe lowly threshold claims thee; The sons of labour know thee; and content Sit in thy shade; but when thou com'st abroad To visit pride, and at his table sit'st, With insult to wait on thee, and directest His service to thine host, then art thouâStop! Did he not say that he had seen her? Ha! And spoken to her? where? when? how? but, noâ That cannot be: my Margaret, they belie theeâ Whose heart is as a glass, in which I see Myself reflected always: [He muses.] What if fortune, (Such things have been) should grind her spirit down To the level of dishonour? Out upon it! I will not yet believe that lieâyet?ânever! [Exit, R. H. SCENE III. âAn Ante-chamber in Maynard's House. Enter Mrs. Hargrave. R. H. D. F. Mrs. H. 'Tis late, and he returns not. Well, the hour, So it bring hope with it, shall yet be early. The children are asleep, or I would read Their eyes, as stars, whose soft auspicious beams, Should be to me as potent as the lore, Writ, as some say, on the eternal roof Of Heaven. Their prattle would beguile me now, When time moves not a pinion, but I hear it Drowsily flagging. Hark! noâit has pass'd The door: 'twas not his step. I will go in, And study patience. [She goes in Enter Hargrave, L. H. Har. She is not here: wearied, perchance, of watching. Re-enter Mrs, Hargrave, D. F. Mrs. H. Oh! you are comeâ'tis strange I did not hear you. Har. 'Tis very late, is't not? and I stept softly. Where are the Maynards? Mrs. H. They have retir'd to rest. Har. That's well. Mrs. H. They waited for you until midnight, Anxious to hear how you had sped. Har. To-morrow Will do for that. Mrs. H. But may I not forestal Their pleasure? Har. 'Twill keep, Nor need a second telling. Mrs. H. You are unkind, Or so unus'd to fortune, you would fain Dally awhile with it before you give Its golden plumage to the general air, For the sun's beams to light on. Har. Margaret, To bear, and to do nought beside but bear, Is thankless toil: to row against a tide, Whose strength mocks human strengthâthis is fool's labour: Ease takes the stream reclines, and is rewarded. That lesson's not too late. Mrs. H. Now, it is idleâ This prelude to a tale which I must hear, And which shall speak of good. It is not well To trifle thus with one who loves you better Than fortune canâand who but cares for fortune So it may make you happy. Har. Dearest wife,â I think that if it lay within your power To serve me, you would do soâwould you not? Mrs. H. You know I would. Har. Well, I believe you, girl. And what if fateâso strange the instruments She calls in aid to raise usâshould make choice Of you to do that office, you would do it? Mrs. H. You never yet had cause to doubt me, Henry, And shall not now: but how am I to serve you? Trust me, I thought it hard, when I had been So oft your special agent to the Council To learn its pleasure, and had almost deem'd, As zeal is prone to do, that I alone Should be the happy bearer of your fortunes, To find another rob me of my pains. I must forgive him, though. Har. And there is nothing You would not cope withâso it might advance me! Mrs. H. Nothing. Har. You would do anything to please me? Mrs. H. Aye,âanything. [Hargrave turns aside, and walks to the back of the stage. Why do you turn away? Har. Margaret, have you not seen two gentlemen, On these your special errands to the Councilâ A stripling one, and one of middle age,â They have spoken to you. Mrs. H. I do remember, Two persons did accost meâ Har. One was handsome,â Mrs. H. I did not note him, and indeed return'd Such brief reply as his unlicens'd speech Left me no choice but give: but what of these? Har. Lord Moreton and his friend. Mrs H. Indeed! Har. Indeed. And mark me, wife, out of such dross as this, Men make their riches now; this is the world: Not the weak fiction of a poet's dream, All that was ever fancied and ne'er felt, Ne'er seen, but sung about: this is a world Of trials, of endurance while they last, And when occasion servesâof compromise. We of ourselves are nothingâcan gain nothingâ Without two others, time and opportunity, Which often meet, and sought, are often seen. Time is propitiousâopportunity Waits but the word, and it is yours to speak it. Mrs. H. This is new doctrine from your lips. Har. Learn'd lately, But not too late. Mrs. H. What must I say? Har. Why, listen. This lord has seen youâloves youâin one wordâ Thus stands the caseâI am poor, and you can raise me. Mrs. H. Can I believe?âwhy, Henry! Henry Hargrave! You cannot mean what yet I fear you mean, And dare not give a name to. [She pauses.] Gracious Heaven! You cannotânay, take your fix'd gaze from off meâ Lest you should see into my heart, and there Read how I hate you. What a change is this! But a few hours ago I would have smil'd The wretch to scorn, who should have breath'd this lieâ For then it were a lie! But now, you come, And with a set face, and a casual voice Speak your own infamy. Even now perhaps, Your children dream of you, and when they wake, Go, tell them how their dreams have wrong'd their father. Oh! shame upon you, added to the shame You have confess'dâand leave meânever more Can I look on you. Har. Hear me, Margaretâ Mrs. H. (Bursting into tears, and falling on Hargrave's neck.] Oh, my dear husband! do not break my heartâ For it will breakâyou are not this vile creature! Upon my knees, let me implore you, pause Ere you sink down to baseness. We are poor, Let us remain so; anything but this: I cannot bear to think of itâhow act The thing we dare not ponder. Oh, my husband! Honour shines bright in darkness, as the stars, And it is crown'd with starsâbut infamy, Deck'd out in all the gauds that wealth can offer, Is still set round with a conspicuous shame, Blighting the brow it circles. Har. Rise, dear wife: And pardon me that, not to satisfy Misgivings of mine own, but to acquit you, From my stung soul, of others' doubts, which henceforth They shall not speak and live, I have thus tried you. Mrs. H. Then it was cruel to have tried me thus. But I will say no more. What, insult, love, Has this man dared to offer? Har. Dared?âtrue, trueâ Why we are poor, my Margaretâthat word Draws obloquy towards it, as the magnet Attracts the steelâthe steel? that is well thought onâ I have a sword yetâ Mrs. H. Tell me, what has happen'd? Har. Come in, and you shall hear: yet I can pardon All that has chanc'd; for never, until now, The blessings that remain to me were known, Or priz'd as blessings. Comeâ [Exeunt R. H. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II SCENE I. âAn Apartment in Maynard's House. Enter Hargrave, followed by Maynard, R. H. May. Well, but be calm.â Har. I cannot. May. And why not? What cause? what do you fearâwhat do you doubt? Har. It is because I do not doubt, I fear,â Doubt has still ground to tread on, though uneven,â But vague surmise, the plaything of the air, Is wafted to and fro, blind and in darkness. May. Your wife is not returned,âis that so strange? She may have been detained,âshe may have paid A visit to a friend.â Har. A friend,âwhat friends? Poverty has no friends; forgive me, Maynard, It was ill spoken;âwhy, then, is she not Here, where her husband and her friends expect her? May. And so she will, no doubt,âand when she comes I'll warrant your conjectures will have travell'd Further than she;âyou're not yourself to day,â What is't you doubt or fear? Har. I'll tell you, sir. You have heard theâshall I term it? contract, sought To have been sign'd between this lord and me, And how I cancell'd it: when I return'd, 'Twas late, last nightânot out of jealousy, For that my nature scornsâbut even as one Owning a pearl, and hearing it decried, Again assures himself 'tis orient, Though conscious of its worth,âeven so I tried her: Hinting that, did she please, she might become The keystone of my fortune. May. You did? Har. I did. May. What then? Har. With flush'd face and with streaming eyes, And voice whose tones spoke virtue, she rebuk'd me; I rais'd, and undeceiv'd her,âask'd her pardon, For having tempted her with idle words, Whose breath was their sole life. May. And this she granted? Har. At once.â May. 'Twas like her. Har. Why, 'twas like her, Maynard. And yet, perhapsâ[He pauses, but presently continues.] Stung by the indignity Offer'd by Moreton,â'tis a price that honour Pays for the privilege of being poorâ I told my wife that I would go this evening, And learn the last decision of the Council, And on their fiat, this way or the other,â Rest, or awake to action: 'twas not approv'd:â On the pretextâI will not say pretext,â Well, on the plea, that should I stir abroad, I might by chance encounter my new Patron, Whence danger might ariseâshe bade me send her.â Urg'd me to charge her with a letter from me, Which she would bear to the Council,ânow, what think you? May. She is gone thither, then? Har. I hope so. Tell me. Could I do otherwise? not for myself, How should I fear this trifler? I consented,â But to give strength and force, and emphasis, To the belief which yet I entertain, That virtue of itself, and in itself, Is fenc'd with safetyâneeding no help from Heaven, Which Heaven has not a ready granted it, To dash the front of license. May. Why, this is true, and is most true of her, Whose absence, which has rais'd such causeless doubts, When she returns one word explains, and ends them. Har. (After a pauseâduring which he appears absorbed in reflection.] Maynard, I cannot think it. May. What? Har. And yet, Hypocrisy, the subtle thief that wears The garb of virtue flauntingly, and makes Her stolen robe a cloak,âfor ornament Sometimes,âsometimes for use:âdo you not mark? There is the danger:â May. Which I do not see. And trust me, Hargrave! 'tis as weak and vile To stare at nothing, making out of nothing A shadow to be fear'd, as to be blind To wrongs, when they confront us. Har. 'Tis well spoken. So true, so trite, and so inapplicable. Then you would have me wink at injuries, See my own honour vanish like a shadow, And when some gross material wrong approaches, Some damning outrage thrust into my fac Open my sleepy eyes, and yawn redress May. Tush, tush, what talk is this? you're mad or childish Take not the snake suspicion to your breast, Which warm'd, will sting you: my life on't, you are wrong, What cause, or no cause, growing out of fancy, Has thus possess'd you suddenly? Har. No cause? Look at me,âlook at me well, and see the cause. This thing, myself, is this the man you knew me? Is this vile wreck the vessel that of yore Spread all its gay sails to the gallant air, And held its way in sunshine? do you think, Love, like the ivy, grows and clings to ruins No, no,âeven she must hate,âeven she must oathe me. And, think you, 'tis in woman to resist Temptation, which with double power persuades, When it can hint the good that may be won, By pointing to the ills to be escaped? May. You dream'd not this last night; and grant one moment Your wifeâfor now I see to what you tendâ Has lent an ear to Moretonâyou mean that? Har. And that you thinkâ May. Nay, Heaven forbid I shouldâ I said, but grant it,âwell, what use, what end, In feigning anger, as you say she did, When she might coldly acquiesce? Har. Guile, guile: She knew that I but feign'd, and feign'd in concert. 'Twas wisely done.â Enter Mrs. Maynard, L. H. May. Now, wife, what news do you bring? The servants are return'd? Mrs. M. They are, but yet Have found no clue or trace of her, 'tis strange: They have sought every where: nor friends nor neighbours, Have seen her once to day. Har. Thanks, my good sister: Your trouble has been vain, I knew 'twould be so; This is a mystery which I alone, Must see to,âyes, must fathom; in an hour, I will return. May. And with your wife, I hope. Har. It may be so. May. But be not rash or hasty. Har. Be sure, I will be neither;âoh! my friend, My soul sinks, and my very blood is cold, As is a winter stream, which slowly creeps Itself to ice, then moves not; should it be soâ Thenâthenâbut fare ye well! [Exit R. H. Mrs. M. This is most strange! My brother is much mov'd. May. Nor do I wonder. It is the first time I have ever known her, Cause even a breath of merest idleness, As âshe stays long,â or, âstrange she comes not sooner;â She has been hitherto so staid, so prudentâ Indeed, I have oft thought too circumspect, As though she fear'd to give her nature scope Even in our presence. Mrs. M. True, I have observ'd it. May. Recal to memory, When you and she have walk'd abroad together, As you have often done,âhave you remark'd A look, a glance, a gesture, anything, Which, for a moment, swerving from the limit Which matron modesty prescribes, suggested Constructive evil of her? Mrs. M. Maynard, no. 'Tis true, her beauty has beguil'd the eyes Of many, till they lost the reverence Her sweetness might have claim'd,âbut the swift blush, Wrought from the sense of her superior honour, Which, while it conquer'd, trembled, has chastis'd The gaze of folly: no, if virtue ever Dwelt by the side of beauty, it resides With her, and in the light of her pure soul Sits, like a shining angel. May. Indeed, I think so.â I spoke not doubtingly of her, but doubting, How on the face of such a sky, such clouds Should suddenly be blown. Mrs. M. They will disperse: For trust me, Maynard, I will never live To wear the world's opinion, if she be not As white as chrystal. May. I am sure she'll prove so. [Exeunt R. H. SCENE II. âAn Apartment in Lord Moreton's House. Enter Moreton and Beauchamp, R. H. More. 'Tis past belief we should so soon surprize her. Fortune lends many chances that we see not, But this unseen, ere we had laid the snare, Is better than design. Beau. I am glad you think so. But is't not worth a moment's thought, my lord, How to retain your capture, now you've seized it? Force suggests force, and such a culverin As Hargrave, scarce will cease till he has blown Our very souls from out us. More. Pshaw! you think not I fear the man; a politic retreat, Effected without loss, is the best valour; The event has prov'd it so. 'Tis very likely, Hargrave will seek redress for his lost honour At the King's hands,âor he may threaten it: Should he do this, 'tis hardly a grave question, To ask if Charles will interpose, or no; 'Twill be but food for laughter, and besides, The fellow's importunity of claim, Enforc'd in such strong language to the Council, Has, I well know, induced a feeling there, That makes his name a discord. I will hold her, Despite this fiery soldier;âwe have only To play with skill the game that skill has fashion'd. Beau. You may command my aid. More. Where is De Grave? May we rely upon her? Beau. You may: she has not taken her degrees In knavery yetâwere she too ripe, she'd fallâ But she is full of promise: the poor rogue Has but one faultâafflicted with a conscience, Which, like a cold, is troublesome sometimes, But easily got rid of. More. Call her hither. [Exit Beauchamp. The hate I bear him, and my love for her, Add zest to this design:âa double triumph. Re-enter Beauchamp with Madame De Grave, C. D. More. How have you left your charge? De G. She is more calm: And weeps in silence, broken but by sobs, 'Tis piteous to hear. Beau. My lord, the heart Of this good creature here, is soft and tender; Perhaps, a weakness of the nerves: your gold Braces sometimes. More. (Giving De Grave a purse.) Take this, and tell me, Madam, Did this unhappy lady, whom 'tis fit You should by every gentle means console, Make overtures to you, as of escape, From thisâshe thinks it soâconstrain'd detention. De G. My lord, when first, obedient to your order, I waited on her, she was proud and sullen, And sat as one confounded; answering nought To words of comfort I addressed to her; But presently, starting as from a dream, She rose, and seeing, read me with her eyes And then approach'd: I trembled at the tone In which she charg'd me with,âshe term'd it baseness, In thus abetting an unlawful act, Fraught, as she said, with vengeance,âI was dumb,â But motion'd her to be appeas'd,âand then She sank upon her knees, imploring mercy; Besought me to release her, said, her friends, Though she herself was poor, at any cost Would gladly recompence me for my goodness In aiding her escape;âI was unmov'd;â And then she sank in tears. Beau. A moving tale. De G. But why, my lord, is she kept here, believe me, I should be loth to further any baseness, Or make myself a partyâ More. Fear not, Madam. No such intent is now on foot; 'tis fit For her own safety,âyou shall know betimes. Meanwhile, no sum her friends could tender you, But shall be tripled for your services. Return to her; a few soft soothing words, May not be out of season; tell her also, A gentleman, a friend, will wait upon her; I shall attend in an adjoining room, And when you have prepar'd her for my presence, Will be at hand. Your friend is my best surety, That my intent is honourable. Beau. Truly. [Exeunt Moreton, and De Grave, D. F. U. E. R. H. But sureties must be paid to be kept sure, They are but sorry trust else; now if ever, On the completion of this enterprise, Must this young lord and I sign, seal, and strike. I must not live, a thing of accident, A stray of fortune, to caprice indebted Alike for promises, reward, or blows. My talents here are hidden, or but glimmer Through a crack'd half-peck measure, 'Sdeath! as well Be a proud thread-bare Captain, like poor Hargrave. Soft, who comes here? Enter Hargrave, with his sword drawn, L. H. Har. The villains would have stay'd me. But I have scar'd them hence. Oh, sir, I know you,â You are the friend of my Lord Moreton; speak, And speak at once, and truly, lest your master Lose your good offices,âwhere is my wife? Beau. (Aside.) The servants should be near. Good Captain Hargrave, I am not bound to satisfy your doubts; You, sir, are not my master; but I'll even Humour your fancy once: where is your wife? 'Twere hard to say; not being mine, I know not: For aught I know she may be here; for aught I care, she may be there;âor anywhereâ One thing is sure enoughâshe knows her way. Har. (Seizing Beauchamp.) Dog!âbut that name exalts you:âcringing coward, Bold only against Heaven, is your vile life Worth one truth's purchase? speak then, or your silence Shall be as still as death. Beau. Help! Murder! Help! Enter Madame De Grave, D. F. who rushes between them. De G. What outcry's this? for mercy's sake, forbear: A stranger arm'd Beau. This fellow, whom I know A reckless villain, would have sought my life. Har. A wretched prize to seek â not worth the finding. Tarry for justice; hence, thou lies and lifeâ One shall destroy the other in due time. Beau. (Aside to De Grave, as he goes out.) Remember! both our fortunes rest upon it. [Exit R. H. De G. Who are you, sir? what do you want? reflect What trouble you may draw upon yourself By brawling in this household;âpray, begone. Har. Madam, you should be true, for you are fair; But that's no sign, come hither;âtell me, tell me,â Is not a lady here? nay, I am calm. De G. Your words are so, and yet your looks are wild; Put up your sword first Har. Well I ask your pardon. Now, Madam,âshe is here.â De G. She has been here. Har. Who has been here? I say that she is here. De G. She may be. Har. Hah!ânay, nay, I will not harm you. Oh! you are strange to falsehood; you must learn To blush when you speak truth: where is she?âwhere? De G. I must confess there is a lady here, Whom you would see, but must not; 'tis her order. Her visits have been frequent, sir,âbut now That she has left her friends; she says, for ever, She would not they should strive to force her hence. You must not see her. Har. Very well:âI will not. She has been often here? De G. Often, sir. Har. Often? De G. Yes, many times. Har. Then fear is prophecy. She has been here, and many times been here? Let me look in your face: By Heaven, 'tis calm As summer waters in the still of noon, On which the sunbeams fret not: but are gather'd Into the perfect shadow, seen below. Swear it. De G. Well, so I can. Har. And you can swear To this, that makes truth madness? You shall not swear it; For, should you swear, and should you falsely swear, Your oath new forg'd, full-charg'd with fate, would drop, Out of the skies and crush you; and 'twould fall In thunder; therefore, woman, do not swear. De G. I pray you, sir, begone: I have spoken truly, And as you wish'd;âI would not for the world, You were seen here. Har. What is the world to me? Gone byâgone byâ: why should vice mock the heavens, By seeming like the angels? she seem'd an angel;â An angel, did I say?âand so she was: The very fiends were angels once, what wonder, If human souls tend downward? De G. Be more calm; Collect yourself; oh, sir, I pity you; If pity were assistance. I could aid you. Har. Often?âcan it be so?âit is not soâ And yet, why not? what leaf or blossom hangs Upon a blighted tree? she is here now. And has been often here: why, you have sworn it. De G. I have spoken true. Har. Aye,â'tis a hideous thing. Not for myself but for her sake, whose soul Is hastening unto ruin. I could wish This had not been. De G. Let me persuade you, sir. Depart at once: stand not absorb'd in thought, But hear me: there are creatures in this house Who heed not blood: go home. Har. What did you say? Go home? aye, so I will: this is a dream, A foolish dream:âgo homeâyes, yes, but how? Can shame walk undetected? will not scorn Stare at me through the darkness, and with gibes Hoot me to infamy? De G. No,â'tis but fancy: You are not well. Har. I am not what I was: Poverty, poverty,â 'Tis there I feel itâthereâit has undone me: Which was the way I came? tell me, I know not. Aye, true,âthere.â [Goingâreturns.] But mark me, not a wordâhush, hush, no word Of what has happen'd now: you must not tell herâ Her whom you have amongst you, I have been here. Say not that I shed tearsâdid I shed tears? And that I told you I should come again, When least they look to see me, and perchance, Shedâno, not tears. [Exit L. H. Enter Beauchamp, R. H. from the opposite side. Beau. So, he is gone: the door has closed upon him. That's past my hopes. What has he said to you? De G. I know not: Beauchamp, you have cozen'd me Into a plot which, should it come to ill, You must endure the brunt of,â Beau. So I shall. De G. Who is this man? and wherefore was I prompted To utter falsehoods which have made him mad. And the sweet lady, who is she? Beau. What matter? Would you take wages, and refuse to earn them? They who once enter on such work as this, Must blink the name, and do it. Virtue or viceâ There is no medium: choose this, or that. Dive, and you pluck up gold,âascend to virtue, And starveâWhat noise was that? De G. I heard no noise. Beau. Noâall is still. Come, you may be requir'd. No faltering: but be firm, and we are made. De G. Yet it is base to live by means like these. Beau. Yet we must live;âmeans are at fortune's option [Exeunt R. H. SCENE III. âAn Apartment in Maynard's House. Enter Maynard, followed by a Servant, R. H. May. Bring me my hat and cloak; and get you ready To go with me; first, call your mistress hither. [Exit Servant. Which way to turn I know notâwhat to do, I know notâevery way I'm at a loss. What if I call upon Lord Moreton,âlearn If Hargrave has been there? but, no, that might Cause more suspicion, which is all too rife Alreadyâyet I must go forth, and seek him. Enter Mrs. Maynard, L. H. Mrs M. Oh, Maynard, he is come. May. Alone? Mrs. M. Alone. May. Where is he? Mrs. May. Entering at the door, I met him. He pass'd in silence,âso, I follow'd him. Halting upon the stairs, he sat him down In a recess, as one quite lost in thought, Or lost to memory: I took his hand, And spoke, not once or twice, but many times,â Still he return'd no answer. May. I'll go to him: He must not be left thus. Mrs. May. Hark,âhere he comes. How wan and haggard! in my life I never Saw him look thus, before. May. Peaceâpeace,âhe speaks. Enter Hargrave, L. H. Har. She loves me still; or she had never set Her lord to buy my honour: oh! I thank her; And shall repay her in due season. May. Hargrave! Har. You know a man who is call'd Henry Hargrave? May. I do,âand am his friend. Har. Be so no longer. For he has liv'd to see his honour die, Who would have died to know that it might live: Yes, he has borne patiently the despite Of fortune, that was noughtâhis inward wealth,â The present here, and the reversion henceâ Gone, goneâ May. What do you mean? Har. Do you not see? Is it not written on my forehead, deep As shame can brand it? Oh, it sears my brain! But, noâthe mark is gone: it has sunk deeper,â Deeper,â'tis grain'd in, into me, and through me. I am become one mass of infamy, Whom Honesty must shun. Where is my sister? Mrs. M. I am here, dear brother. Har. Oh! could you both know What I have heard; they were too wise for meâ Too closeâtoo secretâwhy, they met but onceâ By chanceâ May. Who? Har. But she must die. Is it not time Already, to strip up the sleeve of murder, To whet the knife, and to imbrue the hand? She must die first, and heâyet I could weepâ I could weep, Maynard, but to think upon it. Remember: such a woman as she was,â No, 'tis a lie, as she was notâfor never, Had she been true, could she have fallen so lowâ So from the stars to hell, as this, Mrs. M. Oh, Maynard, He knows not what he saysâhe is distracted. Shall I go fetch his children?âthey, perhaps, May touch his heart. If he could weepâ Har. 'Twere well. But do not bring the wretches to me now, Lest I should tear them piecemeal. Keep them from meâ They are too like their motherâbut, no, no,â May. (Apart to his wife.) Fetch them at once, and quickly. [Exit Mrs. Maynard, L. H. Har. Where is she gone? May. She will return directly. Har. You shall know all, Maynardâyou shall know allâ You must advise me what to do. I'm cool As cowardiceâI know you'll stand my friend. May. You know I will. Har. Yes, yesâit must be done Coldlyâno heat, lest it should look like vengeance, Which is imperial justice newly bath'd, And rob'd in purple. Mrs. Hargrave rushes in L. H. followed by Mrs. Maynard. Mrs. H. Where is my husband? Oh, save me! save me! [She clings to Hargrave.] Har. Who is this woman? take her Away from me! Stand back! where is my sword? [Hargrave is about to unsheath his swordâMaynard stays him. I cannot kill her. Could I draw this weaponâ Which yet I cannot doâI could not kill her. See, how she looks: 'tis virtue only diesâ Go, pray for death. Mrs. H. (To Mrs. Maynard.) Oh, madam, speak to him. Pity me, Hargraveâoh, take pity on me. When you know all you willâI am sure you will. First hear me, and then kill meâbut you will not When you have heard me. Mrs. M. Brother, if you ever Lov'd herâand if you ever lov'd your sisterâ Hear her: upon my life she's innocent. May. I would stake mine, she is so. Har. Why, say on. If she be soâand yet that cannot beâ Proceed. Mrs. H. It is a tale of horror, Henry, Yet I must tell it. When I left this morningâ Oh, it seems ages since!âI made all speed To execute my mission. Ere I reach'd My destination, suddenly two men Rush'd from behind, and held me fast, and thrust me Into a carriage, which drove off and stopt I know not whereâ'twas at a houseâand then They dragg'd me to a room, in which they left me Alone, I think for hours: at length a femaleâ Har. A Frenchwoman? Mrs. H. She was. Har. Oh, Heaven! Proceed. Mrs. H. Enter'd, and brought refreshmentsâstrove to soothe meâ Telling me that a gentleman, a friend, Would wait upon me soon: he came at last. Har. Moreton? Mrs. H. The man you spoke of yesternight. Har. And this is true? It is! Oh, Maynard, Maynard! What a weak gull was I? I saw it not. Mrs. H. You will not hate me when I tell you all? Oh, madam, pity me! I cannot speak itâ And yet it must be told. Har. Go onâgo on. Mrs. H. He came at last, and with respect address'd meâ But presently, grown bolder, he approach'd, And would have clasp'd me. With a shriek I broke Away from him, and fled: the door was lock'dâ Again he siez'd me! Oh, I cannotâ Har. Ha! I see him dead before me! Why do you tremble? How I must kill himâhew him into pieces! Come hither to me, wife: ere you say more Embrace meâthere. Maynard, my sister, stand Apart from usânowânow, my poor wrong'd girl, If there is something horrible to tellâ I know there isâwhisper itâwhisper it now It will not make me mad. Mrs. H. 'Tis horrible, But 'tis not shameâupon that wasted brow No shame, like shame, shall sit. I struggled with him, With strength that madness lendsâupon the table There lay a knifeâIâ Har. Kill'd himâhe's deadâsay thatâ Mrs. H. Alas, I fearâ Har. Ha, ha! that's wellâthat's well. Why, this is justiceâjustice. How got you here? Mrs. H. I know not. Oh, support me! Mrs. M. She has fainted! Har. Maynard, what crown that might adorn a queen, But would look dim and rayless on that brow. Softâshe revives. Mrs. H. Where am I? Har. With friends, my sweet one. May. This is no place for you. You must away Instantly. Who comes here? too lateâtoo late! Enter Beauchamp, with Officers. Mrs. H. (Clinging to Hargrave.) Save me from him! I know him! Har. So do I, And know him for a villain! May. Let me speak. How is it, sirs, that at this time of night, You forcibly make entrance to the house And chamber of a peaceful citizen? Beau. Are you the master of this house? May. I am. Beau. Then, my good friend, not to offend the laws, But to uphold the laws, are we come hither. There is a woman here who has committed A most foul murder. That is sheâsecure her! [The Officers advance Mrs. H. They will not take me from you! Har. No, they shall not. We will attend you. Gentlemen, stand offâ I shall conduct her hence. Nay, all is wellâ Tremble not so. Maynard, you will assist me? Thank you. Poor girl! 'tis a hard trial for you. [To Beau.] For you, sir, look for justice. Beau. I await it, And am prepared to meet it. Come, lead on. Har. (To his Wife.) Compose yourselfâbe not afraidâremember, 'Tis not the act, but cause which makes the act, Or bad, or good. Come, that is wellâso, soâ [Exeunt L. H. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âAn Apartment in Maynard's House. Hargrave and Mrs. Maynard discovered. Mrs. M. Nay, sit awhile: this ferment of your spiritsâ Har. Must be kept up,âshould I stand still one moment, Their retrocession would o'erwhelm me, Mary. That portrait of my father, which you shew'd meâ How many years since I have seen it? twelveâ 'Tis like him. Mrs. M. Very. Har. Yes, the hale old man, With winter on his brow, but midsummer Upon his cheek and lip. Mrs. M. And then his eye, That used to play his tongue false when he chid us, And spoke the love his words conceal'dâ Har. Yes, yes,â I well remember. Mrs. M. Do you remember, Henry, Once when we stray'd from home, and my poor mother,â Har. Speak not of her. Mrs. M. Oh! those were happy daysâ Or is it but our mental alchymy, Which turns the past to gold. making e'en sorrow, Assume the presence and the hue of joy? I know not; well, but they were happy days; Even to deem they were so makes them so, Now they are gone. You do not heed me, brotherâ Har. What?â Was not that a sound of acclamation In the street just now? pr'ythee, look from the window, And see if they be coming. I had not thought, That anything in all the world could move, As circumstance now sways me. Do you see them? Mrs. M. I do not: by and by they will be here; Meanwhile forget, if it be possible, What yet awaits you. Har. Would I could do so. We wander through these lone deserted rooms, Seeking to fly from that we bear within us, Which our own thoughts have made, and cannot shake Out of our souls. Enter Maynard, L. H. Oh! Maynardâhe is here. [To Mrs. Maynard.] Well, Maynard, you have brought her; she is below: 'Tis better she were left awhile alone, 'Twill calm her spirits. Did she not bear her trial Bravely? I know she didâyou do not speak. What! how is this? May. Hargrave, I must not speak. Oh! be compos'd. Har. I am. May. And fear the worst. Har. I doânot knowing what you deem the worst. One word,âI ask no more: one word, at once; My wife has beenâ May. Condemn'd. Har. Condemn'd!âcondemn'd! What do you mean? [To Mrs. May.] Why do you clasp my hand? I am quite calm. Condemn'd! for what? for virtue? For being virtuous?âthe atonement? May. Death. Har. This is a cruel jest, if it be one. It is, I know it isâyou cannot meanâ She is belowâshe isâhow? no! d'ye say so? [To Mrs. May.] Go to him: bid him tell me plainly, briefly, Ere my brain burst asunder Why do you look So piteously upon me? go to him. May. This is the heaviest day that ever fell upon us all. Har. Yes, yesâ[Impatiently.] May. Through perjury, Horrible perjury, is she condemn'd. The villain Beauchamp, and De Grave, a woman Whom you once saw, have sworn, your wife and Moreton Were intimate; on manifold occasions That she had jewels from him, and obtained Money, which fear of your revenge extorted: And that upon the fatal night, unable By strong persuasions and by threats to move him To further gifts, (and this, so they have sworn, The man upon his dying bed averr'd) She murder'd him. Mrs. M. Oh, dreadful wickedness! May. Peace,âpeace. Mrs. M. It was not well to tell him this At such a time: see, how he stands. Oh, Maynard! You have made him mad. My dear, dear brother, speak; Speak; in the name of mercy, speak to us. Har. I cannot: there is something here that chokes me, And will not let me speak: presentlyâpresentlyâ Stand you away from meâlet me have air, [Tears open his shirt. Aye, that is better. I have heard it all. A thief! money and jewelsâpresentsâgiftsâ What hell will hold this man who dying, lies That thieves may live by lying? Why, I could laugh At this. They have treated you harshly, my poor wife. In what impossible corner of the earth Does Justice dwell? where is her sword? 'tis stolen, And felons murder with it safely, safely. May. What can I say to him? Command yourself; Shake off this stuporâall may yet be well. Har, Nay, all is well. Think you this world of ours, This little all of slaves, comprises all? I must go to herâshe will wish To see me in this hour of heavy trial. Mrs. M. You will not leave us yet. Har. I had forgotten: No, noâone moment more. [He goes into an inner room, and returns with his sword. Maynard, in all my lifeâand I have liv'd Too many years, since I have liv'd 'till nowâ I never knew but one firm constant friend, And you are he. I thank you, Maynard, I thank you, and that word includes my heart. My good, kind sister, I would say much to you, but cannot speak it. They'll want a mother soon, will you be one To them? Your hand has told me soâenough. The blessings of the earth be on ye both, The light of heaven for ever! Fare ye well. [Going.] May. May we not go with you? Har. I would go alone. I have that to say to her you must not hear. You wish, I know, to see her once again Beforeâwell, well, you may come after meâ In half an hourâyes, 'twill be time enough. [Exit L. H. Mrs. M. I cannot weep; this blow has stunn'd my senses. Where is he gone? His heart is broken, Maynard; It is not safe that he should go alone. How came this change to beâthis sudden change? You had no fear of thisâno doubtâno thought? May. I had not, and know nothing but that lifeâ My life, or your's, or any one's, remains For every slave to lie and swear away. Mrs. M. But is there, then, no chanceâno human means Whereby she may be sav'd? May. You must not hope itâ There is no chance. Cast water on the ground, And hope to conjure every several drop Back to the vessel whence you threw it, then Expect she may be sav'd. Now, as I breathe, I would give all I have, and all I hope for On this side deathâalmost my life itselfâ That this had never chang'd. I love your brother As though he were mine own; his gentle nature Won me long since, and never, as I think, A truer woman liv'd than she we pray for. Madame De G. (Without.) But I must see him! Madame de Grave rushes in, L. H. Where is her husband? where is Captain Hargrave? Oh, sir! I know you now. You should remember me, too. May. Madame de Grave? De G. Aye, and the recent wife of that base villain Whom I have left, never to see again May. What is your present purpose? you would seeâ De G. Her husband whom our oaths have falsely charg'd. May. Hah! you shall see him. De G. You are his friends? Mrs. M. We are. May. Peaceâlet me speak. What would you say to him? De G. I know not how I bore that dreadful trial With her meek eyes upon me; Heaven spoke through them, And bade me think of a more fearful trial, And I the culprit. Oh, sir, pardon me. Lord Moreton told us nothing; when we sought him, We found him dead; the jewels, which we swore He gave her, I possess, and can produce them. The whole is false. Oh! ere it be too late, Take me where all may be confess'd,âmy heart Will break else. Mrs. M. Oh, unlook'd-for happiness! Blessings attend you, madam. Heaven has done this. May. It is indeed the work of Heaven. Come, madam, You will go with me: Mary, dry your tears; Prepare to bear us instant company. You are willing, madam, to make full confession, Before a judge, of this? De G. I amâI amâ And shall be happy then. May. No harm shall reach you. Come, all is wellâ'twill be a fair day yet. Mary, your hand. Mrs. M. Let us make haste to join them. [Exeunt. SCENE II. âThe interior of a Prison. Mrs. Hargrave discovered lying on a couch at the back of the Stage. Enter Hargrave. Har. She sleeps. Now, mercy with thy sacred balm, Anoint her soul, and the sweet dew of peace Drop on her heart, that she may glow of Heaven, Ere Heaven receive her pure and gentle spirit. [Mrs. H. rises, and perceiving her husband, approaches him. Mrs. H. I have wish'd to see you, Henry; they have made me Guiltier than truth could make meâthey have sought My life, and they will take my life, by means That even murder's self would shudder at. One fear, and only one, remains: can you Believe me the vile wretch they falsely make me? Har. I have deserv'd this at your hands, and feel The deep reproach. Oh, Margaret, Margaret, My words are words that have no space to hold The feelings that oppress me. Could my soul speak, You had not ask'd that question. Mrs. H. It has spoken. Thank God for that. Forgive meâI am happy. Har. Can you be happy in an hour like this? Mrs. H. I couldâbut to leave you and the dear childrenâ This is death's bitterness. Har. They are protected. Mrs. H. And you, dear Henry? Har. Heaven will not desert me. Mrs. H. In whom I trust. Oh, Henry, I have pray'd, And have not pray'd in vain. No heart so weak, But Heaven can fill it with an angel's strength: That strength, my husband, is effus'd from prayer. The world, which once, I fear, we lov'd too well, Thought of too muchâapplied ourselves too long In vain to satisfy, is pass'd away, Like a thin shadowâwhich it isâ'tis vanish'd, Melted, and all my hopes are gone before me, To the one kingdom. Har. Why, 'tis wellâ'tis well. You have done with a most worthless worldâ'tis wellâ And through the wide and ever-open gate Of death, would pass to gloryâbut the death,â You have not thought of thatâthe ignominy, The hideous shame, whose engines cauterize Our name for ever: that might be escap'd. Might it not be escap'd? I would out-tire A thousand years in prison, so that this Dishonour might be spar'd. Mrs. H. Do not talk thus: Pray for me, rather, that my nature fail not In the last dreadful moment. Har. I cannot. The time is near at hand, and I must speak. This shall not be; I should go mad to know itâ I must not see you perish on the scaffold, A public spectacle of shameâa show, For myriads to gaze upon with horror. Mrs. H. Speak not thus wildly to meâit must beâ My life is forfeit to the laws, and I Must pay the penalty. Har. Yes, but how? but how? Forestall the actâanticipate the doom,â We have the precious means in our own hands. Mrs. H. What means are these? Har. Here! [Produces a phial.] Let us die together. Mrs. H. Oh, weak, rash man! what is a shameful death, If this is glorious? Because the night is dark, Who tempts the lightning? Do you wish to die Because you fear to live, and yet would rush Into a world of never-ending life, And endless woe to those that came unsought. Promise me thisâswear to me you will live. We are not as ourselves, but as our keepers In trust for others, dearer than ourselves, And for their sakeâ Har. You torture me in vain. I cannot bear the thoughtâmust not endure it. You plead as ever, like yourself and virtue, But now your words rebound from my full heart, And fall unheeded. Mrs. H. Yet reflect, reflectâ The power that has permitted the event Forecasts the issue. Trust thatâmistrust yourself. May. (Without.) Where are they? Conduct me to them instantly. Har. They come to take their last farewell of you: The time's at hand, and they will bear you hence, To instant execution. I will not live To see it. [Hargrave is about to take the poison, when Mrs. Hargrave, with a shriek, snatches it from his hand.] Enter Maynard, followed by his Wife. May. I have such tidings for you. Mrs. H. Oh, speak themâspeak them! May. The woman has confess'dâBeauchamp's secur'dâ A respite has been grantedâthe King's pardon Will follow it betimes. [Hargrave drops upon his knees. Mrs. A. (After a pause.) Oh, my friendsâ Your timely news has sav'd two livesâperhaps, Two soulsâbut that must not be dwelt on now. My husband! Har. Margaret! [They embrace] Mrs. H. Let none with impious doubt, Suggest to Providence the way to guide him Which when he least perceives, and would defy her, Is then most prompt to serve him. THE CURTAIN FALLS.</field>
