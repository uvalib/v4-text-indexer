      <field name="fulltext">DEUS Ego sum alpha et omega, 1, primus et novissimus. I God, greatest of degree, in whom begyninge non may bee, that I am pearles of postee, nowe appertly that shalbe preeved. In my godhead are persons three; maye non in faye from other flee. Yett soveraygne might that ys in mee may justly be meeved. It ys full youre syns I beheight to make a reckoninge of the right. Nowe to that doome I will mee dight that dead shall dulye dread. Therefore, my angelles fayre and bright, looke that you wake eych worldlye wight that I maye see all in my sight that I blood forth can bleede. Shewe you my crosse appertlye here, crowne of thorne, sponge and speare, and nayles to them that wanted nere to come to this anoye; and what weede for them I weare, upon my bodye nowe I beare. The most stowtest this sight shall steare that standeth by streete or stye. ANGELUS PRIMUS Lord that madest through thy might heaven and yearth, daye and night, withowt distance wee be dight your byddinge for to donne. And for to awake eyche worldlye wight I shall bee readye, and that in height, that they shall shewe them in thy sight. Thou shalt see, lord, full soone. SECUNDUS ANGELUS Take wee our beames and fast blowe. All mankynd shall them knowe. Good accompt that nowe can shewe, soone yt shalbe seene. That have done well in there lyvinge, they shall have joye withowt endinge. That evell have done withowt mendinge shall ever have sorrowe and teene. Tunc angeli tubas accipient et flabunt, et omnes mortui de sepulchris surgent, quorum dicat primus Papa Salvatus. PAPA SALVATUS A, lord, mercye nowe aske wee, that dyed for us on the roode-tree. Hit ys three hundreth yeares and three synce I was put in grave. Nowe through thy might and thy postye thy beames blast hath raysed meeâ I, flesh and blood as I nowe seeâ my judgment for to have. While that I lyved in flesh and bloodd, thy great godhead that ys so good mee knewe I never, but ever was wood worshipps for to wynne. The wyttes, lord, thou sent to mee I spend to come to great degree. They highest office under thee in yearth thou puttest me yn. Thou grantest me, lord, through thy grace, Peters power and his place. Yett was I blent. Alas, alas, I dyd not thyne assent. But my fleshlye will that wicked was, the which raysed nowe thou hasse, I forthered, lord, before thy face shall take his judgment. When I in yearth was at my will, this world mee blent, both lowde and styll; but thy commandment to fulfill I was full neglygent. But purged yt ys with paynes yll in purgatorye that sore can gryll. Yett thy grace I hope to come tyll after my great torment. And yett, lord, I must dread thee for my great synne when I thee see; for thou art most in majestie, of mercye nowe I call. The paynes that I have longe in bee, as hard as hell save hope of lee, agayne to goe never suffer mee for ought that may befall. IMPERATOR SALVATUS A, lord and soveraygne savyoure, that lyvinge put mee to honour and made me kinge and emperour, highest of kythe and kynneâ my flesh, that fallen was as the flowre, thou hasse restored in this stowre and with paynes of great languowre clensed mee of my synne. In purgatorye my soule hath binne a thousand yeares in woe and teene. Nowe ys noe synne upon mee seene, for purged I am of pyne. Though that I to synne were bayne and bowne and coveted ryches and renowne, yett at the last contrytion hath made mee on of thyne. As hard payne, I darre well saye, in purgatorye are night and daye as are in hell, save by on wayeâ that one shall have an end. Worshipped bee thou, high justice, that mee hasse made in flesh to ryse. Nowe wott I well, those that have binne wyse shall come unto thy welth. Grant me, lord, amongest moe, that purged am of synne and woe, on thy right hand that I maye goe to that everlastinge health. REX SALVATUS A, lord of lordes and kinge of kinges and informer of all thinges, thy power, lord, spreades and springes, as soothly here ys seene. After bale, boote thou bringes, and after teene-tyde tydinges to all that ever thy names mynes and buxon to thee benne. While I was lord of land and leede in purple and in rych weede, meethought to thee I had no neede, so wronge the world me wyled. Though thou for me thy blood can sheede, yett in my hart more can I heede my flesh to further and to feede, but the soule was ever begyled. My fowle bodye through synne blent, that rotten was and all torent, through thy might, lord omnipotent, raysed and whole yt ys. My soule that ys in bales brent to my bodye thou hast nowe sent to take before the judgment of that I have donne amys. But, lord, though I were synfull aye, contrytion yett at my last daye and almes-deedes that I dyd aye hath holpen me from hell. But well I wott that ylke waye that Abraham went wynde I maye, for I am purged to thy paye, with thee evermore to dwell. REGINA SALVATA Pearles prynce of most postye that after langwore lendeth lee, that nowe in bodye hasse raysed mee from fyre to rest and roweâ my flesh, that as flowre can flye and powder was, through thy pyttie together hasse brought, as I nowe see, the soule and bodye too. While I in yearth rych can goe in softe sandalles and silke alsoe, velvet also that wrought me woe, and all such other weedes, neyther prayed I ney faste. Saffe almes-deedes, yf any paste, and great repentance at the laste hath gotten me to thy grace, that saved I hope fullye to bee, for purged synnes that were in mee. Thy laste doome may I not flee, to come before thy face. All that might excyte lecheryeâ perrelles and precyouse perryeâ agaynst thy byddinge used I, and other wycked deedes. After purgatorye-paynes from me thy lordshippe thou ney laynes. To warne thy doome mee ney gaynes, though I were never so greate. Sythe I have suffred woe and teene in purgatorye longe too benne, lett never my synne be on me seene but, lord, thou hit forgett. Tunc venient damnati. PAPA DAMNATUS Alas, alas, alas, alas! Nowe am I worse then ever I was. My bodye agayne the soule hasse that longe hase benne in hell. Together the beeânowe ys noe graceâ fyled to bee before thy face, and after my death here in this place in payne ever to dwell. Nowe bootelesse ys to aske mercye, for, lyvinge, highest in yearth was I, and cunynge closen in cleargye; but covetousnes dyd me care. Also sylver and symonye made mee pope unworthye. That burnes me nowe, full witterlye, for of blys I am full bare. Also, why spend I wronge my wytte in covetousnes my hart to knytte? Hard and hott nowe feele I hitt; hell howldes me right here. My bodye burnes everye bytt. Of sorrowe must I never be shutt. Mee to save from hell-pytt nowe helpeth noe prayer. Of all the soules in Christianitie that damned were while I had degree nowe gyve accompt behoveth mee, through my lawes forlorne. Also damned nowe must I bee. Accompt befalles, or elles to flee. Make me deafe, I cojure thee, as I had never binne borne. IMPERATOR DAMNATUS Alas, nowe sterred I am in this stowre. Alas, nowe fallen ys my flowre. Alas, for synne nowe cease succour. No sylver maye mee save. Alas, that I ever was emperoure. Alas, that I ever had towne or towre. Alas, hard bye I my honour; hell-paynes for yt I have. Alas, in world whye was I ware? Alas, that ever mother mee bare! Alas, there ys noe yeane-chare! Scape may I not this chance. Alas, doe evell who ys that dare? To threpe no more us ne dare, for to payne we ordayned are, ever withowt delyverance. Nowe ys manslaughter upon mee seene. Nowe covetousnes makes my care keene. Nowe wronge-workinge, withowten weene, that I in world have wrought, nowe traytorouse tornes do me teene, and false doomes all bydeene. In gluttonye I have in binne that shall nowe deare be bought. Nowe knowe I what I dyd with wronge and eke my lyther lyvinge longe. Falsehoode to hell makes mee to fonge, in fyre ever fowle to fare. Misbegotten money ever I myxed amonge. Nowe ys me yeelded to hell yonge. Whye were I not dead as ys the donge? For deole I drowpe and dare! REX DAMNATUS Alas, unlykinge ys my lott. My weale ys gonne, of woe I wott. My synne ys seene I was in sett. Of sorrowe nowe may I synge. To hell-payne that ys so hott for my misdeedes wend I mot. Alas, that I hadd beene sheepe or goatte when I was crowned kinge. When I was in my majestie, soveraigne of shyre and of cyttye, never did I good. In noe degree through me was any grace. Of poore had I never pittie. Sore ne sycke would I never see. Nowe have I languowre and they have lee. Alas, alas, alas! Wronge ever I wrought to eych wight. For pennyes, poore in payne I pight. Relygion I reaved agaynst the right. That [keenlye] nowe I knowe. Lecherye, I held hit light. In covetousenes my hart was clight. On good deede in God his sight nowe have I not to shewe. REGINA DAMNATA Alas, alas! Nowe am I lorne. Alas! With teene nowe am I torne. Alas, that I was of woman borne, this bytter bale to byde. I made my moane both even and [morne] for feare to come Jesu beforne that crowned for mee was with thorne and thrust into the syde. Alas, that I was woman wrought. Alas, whye God made me of nought and with his pretyouse blood me bought to worke agaynst his wyll? Of lecherye I never wrought, but ever to that synne I sought, that of that fylth in deede and thought yett had I never that fyll. Fye on pearles! Fye on prydee! Fye on gowne! Fye on guyde! Fye on hewe! Fye on hyde! These harrowe me to hell. Agaynst this chance I may not chyde. This bitter bale I must abyde. Yea, woe and teene I suffer this tyde, noe lyvinge tonge may tell. I, that soe seemelye was in sight, where ys my blee that ys so bright? Where ys baron, where ys knight for mee to alledge the lawe? Where in world ys any wight that for my fayrenes nowe wyll fight, or from this death I am to dight that darre mee heathen drawe? JUSTICIARIUS DAMNATUS Alas! Of sorrowe nowe ys my sawe. Alas! For hell I am in awe. My fleshe as flowre that all to-flawe nowe tydes a fearely fytt. Alas, that ever I learned lawe, for suffer I must manye a hard thrawe; for the devyll will me drawe right even into his pytt. Alas! While that I lyved in land, wrought] to worke I would not wond but falsely causes tooke in hand and mych woe dyd elles. When I sought sylver or rych sound of baron, burges, or of bound, his moote to further ever I would found, were yt never so false. Nowe ys the dyvell readye, I see, his moote to further agaynst mee for the judge of such postye that mee wyll not avayle; harte and thought both knoweth hee. Though I would lye, noe boote wyll bee. Alas, this hard fytt to flee rufullye I must fayle. All my lyeffe ever I was bowne to trouble poore in towre an towne, payre Holy Church possession and sharpely them to shend. To reave and robbe relygion, that was all my devotyon. Therefore mee tydes damnatyon and payne withowten end. MERCATOR DAMNATUS Alas, alas, nowe woe ys mee! My fowle bodye, that rotten hath be, and soule together nowe I see. All stynketh, full of synne. Alas! Marchandize maketh mee, and purchasinge of land and fee, in hell-payne evermore to bee, and bale that never shall blynne. Alas! In world fervent was I to purchase landes falselye. Poore men I dyd such anoye, made them theire landes to sell. But when I dyed, wytterlye, all that I had, my enemye both bodye and soule damned therebye ever to the payne of hell. Yett might not false purchase suffyce, but ofte I dealed with marchandyce; for there methought wyninge would ryse, I used yt manye a yeare. Ofte I sett upon false assyce, rayvinge poore with layinge myse. Falsely, by God and saynte Hyse a thousand tyme I sware. Occurre I used wylfullye. Wanne I never so much therebye, to Holye Church never taythed I, for meethought that was lorne. Why made thou me, lord, of nought? Whye? To worch in world so wickedlye and nowe burne in the dyvelles bellye? Alas, that ever I was borne! Finitis lamentationibus mortuorum, [descendet] Jesus quasi in nube, si fieri poterit, quia, secundum doctoris opiniones, in aere prope terram judicabit Filius Dei. Stabunt angeli cum cruce, corona spinea, lancea, et instrumentis aliis; ipsa demonstrant. JESUS You good and evell that here benne lent, here you come to your judgment, yf you wyst whereto hit would appent and in what manere. But all myne, as I have mentâ prophettes, patriarches here presentâ must knowe my doome with good intent. Therefore I am nowe here. But you shall heare and see expresse I doe to you all rightwysenes. Loovesome deedes more and lesse I wyll rehearse nowe here. Of yearth through mee made, man, thou was and putt in place of greate cleanes from which thou was, through wyckednes, away then wayved weare. When thou had donne this trespasse, yett wayted I which way best was thee to recover in this case into my companye. Howe might I do thee more grace then that selfe kynd that thou hasse takeâhere nowe in this place appeareth appertlyeâ after dyed on the roode-tree and my blood shedd, as thou may see, to pryve the devyll of his postie and wynne that was awaye; the which bloodâbehouldes yeeâ fleshe-houlden tell nowe I would should be for certayne poyntes that lyked mee of which I will nowe saye. On cause was this, certeynlye, that to my Father almightie at my Assentyon offer might I this blood, prayinge a boone: that hee of you should have mercye and more gracyous be therebye when you had synned horryblie, not takinge vengeance to soone. Also, I would, withowten were, this bloodd should nowe be shewed here that the Jewes dyd in this manere might knowe appertlye howe unkynd they them beare. Behould on mee and you may lere whether I be God in full powere or elles man onlye. Also, my blood nowe shewed ys that good therebye maye have blys that avoyded wyckednes, iwys, and ever good workes wrought. And evyll also, that dyd amysse, must have greate sorrowe in sight of this that lost that joye that was his that him on roode-tree bought. Yett, for all this greate torment that suffered here while I was lent, the more spared in your intent. I am not as I feele. For my bodye ys all torent with othes false alwayes fervent; noe lymme on mee but yt is lent from head right to the heele. Nowe that you shall appertlye see freshe blood bleede, man, for theeâ good to joye and full greate lee, the evyll to damnatyon. Behould nowe, all men! Looke on mee and see my blood freshe owt flee that I bleede on roode-tree for your salvatyon. Tunc emittet sanguinem de latere eius. Howe durst you ever doe amys when you unthought you of this, that I bleede to bringe you to blys and suffered such woo. Me you must not white, iwysse, though I doe nowe as right ys. Therefore eych man reacon his, for ryghtwysenes must goo. PAPA SALVATUS A, lord, though I lyved in synne, in purgatorye I have [bene] in. Suffer my bale for to blynne and bringe mee to this blysse. IMPERATOR SALVATUS Yea, lord, and I have therein bee more then three hundreth yeares and three. Nowe I am cleane, forsake not mee, although I dyd amysse. REX SALVATUS Lord, receyve me to thy grace that payne hath suffered in this place. Although I foule and wycked was, washen yt ys awaye. REGINA SALVATA And I, lord, to thee crye and call, thy owne christen and thy thrall, that of my synnes am purged all, of thy joye I thee praye. JESUS Come hither to mee, my dearlynges deare, that blessed in world alwayse weare. Take my realme, all in feare, that for you ordayned ys. For while I was on yearth here you gave mee meate, in good manere; therefore in heaven-blysse cleare you shall ever lenge, iwysse. In great thyrst you gave me drynke, when I was naked also clothinge, and when mee needed harboringe you harbored me in cold. And other deedes to my lykinge you dyd on yearth there lyvinge. Therefore you shall be quytte that thinge in heaven an hundrethfold. PAPA SALVATUS Lord, on this can I not mynne: earth when I was dwellinge in, thee in myscheffe or any unwynne to shewe such a will. IMPERATOR SALVATUS Noe, syckerlye! I can have noe mynde that ever to thee I was so kynd, for there I might thee never fynd, such kyndnes to fulfyll. JESUS Yes, forsoothe, my freindes deare, such as poore and naked weare, you cladd and fedd them both in feere and harbored them alsoe. Such as weare also in great dangere, in hard prysoun yn yearth here, you visited them in meeke mannere, all men in such woe. Therefore, as I you ere tould, you shalbe quytt an hundrethfould. In my blysse, bee you bowld, evermore you shall bee. There neyther honger ys ney could but all thinges as yourselves wouldâ everlastinge joye to yonge and old that in yearth pleased mee. Therfore, my angelles, goe you anon and twyne my chosen everye one from them that have benne my foen and bringe them unto blysse. On my right hand they shall be sett, for soe full yore I them beheight when the dyd withowten lett my byddinge not amysse. PRIMUS ANGELUS Lord, we shall never blynne tyll we have brought them blys within, those soules that benne withowten synne, full soone, as you shall see. SECUNDUS ANGELUS And I knowe them well affyne which bodyes, lord, that benne thyne. The shall have joye withowten pyne that never shall ended bee. Tunc angeli ibunt ac cantabunt euntes ac venientes âLetamini in domino, salvator mundi, domine.â Ac omnes salvati eos sequentur; postea veniunt demones, quorum dicat Primus. DEMON PRIMUS A, rightuouse judge, and most of might, that there art sett to deeme the right, mercye thou was, nowe ys gright, to save these men from pyne. Doe as thou hast yoare beheight. Those that be synnfull in thy sight, to reacon there deedes I am dight to proove these men for myne. Judge this pope myne in this place that worthye ys for his trespaceâ and ought to be thyne through graceâ through synne commynne myne. A christen man I wott hee was, knewe good from evell in eych case, but my commandment donne hee hase, and ever forsaken thyne. Through mercye hee should be thyne, but myne through wyckednes and synne; thyne through passion thou was in, and myne through temptatyon. To mee obedyent hee was aye, and thy commandment put awaye. Thou righteouse judge therefore I praye, deeme him to my pryson. This emperour also that standeth by, I hould him myne full wytterlye, that held him ever in heresye and leeved not on thy lore. Therefore I tell thee verament myne hee ys withowt judgment. Thou sayd, when thou on yearth went, that leeved not, damned were. âQui non credit, jam judicatus est.â This kinge and queene would never knowe poore men, them almes to showe. Therefore, put them all from you that stand before thy face, and I shall leade them tyll a lowe; there fyre shall burne though no man blowe. I have them tyed upon a rowe; they shall never passe that place. SECUNDUS DEMON Naye, I wyll spute with him this that sytteth as high justice, and yf I see he be righteous soone I shall assaye. And other he shall, forsooth iwysse, forsake that of him wrytten ys or these men that have donne amysse, deeme them us todaye. These wordes, God, thou sayde expresse, as Matthewe thereof bayreth wyttnes, that right as mans deedes was yeelden hee should bee. And, lest thou forgett, good man, I shall mynne thee upon, for speake Latten well I can, and that thou shall soone see. âFilius hominis venturus est in gloria Patris, Patris sui cum angelis suis, et tunc reddit unicuiquam secundum opus suum.â Therefore, righteouse yf thou bee, these men are myne, as mote I thee, for on good deede here before thee have they not to shewe. Yf there bee anye, saye on! Lettes see! Yf there be nonne, deeme them to mee; or elles thou art as false as weeâ all men shall well knowe. DEMON PRIMUS Yea, this thou sayd, verament, that when thou came to judgment thy angelles from thee should be sent to put the evyll from the good and put them into great torment, there reemynge and grennynge verey fervent; which wordes to clearkes here present I wyll rehearse. âSic erit in consummatione seculi: exibunt angeli et [seperabunt] malos de medio justorum, et mittent eos in caminum ignis, ubi erit fletus et stridor dentium.â Therefore delyver mee these men and, as broke I my panne, I shall make them to grynne and rufullye to reeme. And in as whott a chimneye as ys ordayned for mee bathed they all shalbee in bitter bale and brenne. This popelard pope here present with covetousenes was aye fullye bent. This emperour also, verament, to all synne did enclyne. This kinge also all righteouse men shent, damned them through false judgment and dyed so withowt amendment; therefore I hould him myne. This queene, while shee was lyvinge here, spared never synne, in no mannere, and all that myght, by Mahound so dere, excyte her lecherye shee used, mans harte to styrre, and thereto fullye ordayned her. Therefore shee hath lost her lure, heaven-blysse, right as dyd I. JESUS Loe, you men that wycked have benne, what Sathan sayth you heren and seene. Rightuouse doome may you not fleene, for grace ys put awaye. When tyme of grace was endurynge, to seeke yt you had no lykinge. Therefore must I, for anythinge, doe rightuousenes todaye. And though my sweete mother deare and all the sayntes that ever were prayed for you right nowe here, all yt were to late. Noe grace may growe through theire prayere. Then rightuousenes had no powere. Therefore, goe to the fyre in feere. There gaynes noe other grace. When I was hungrye and thyrstie both, and naked was, you would not mee clothe; also, sycke and in greate woe, you would not vysytt mee; nor yett in pryson to me come, nor of your meate to gyve me somee, nor mee to your harboure nome never yett in wyll were yee. PAPA DAMNATUS When was thou naked or harborlesse, hongrye, thyrstie, or in sycknes; eyther in any prysoun was? Wee sawe thee never a-could. IMPERATOR DAMNATUS Hadd we thee hungrye or thyrstie seene, naked, sycke, or in prysoun benne, harborlesse or in anye teene, have harbored thee we would. JESUS Naye! When you sawe the leaste of myne that on yearth suffered pyne, with your rychesse you would not ryne ney fulfill my desyre. And syth you would nothinge enclyne for to helpe my poore lyne, to mee your love yt was not fyne. Therefore, goe to the fyre! PRIMUS DEMON A, syr judge, this goeth aright. By Mahound mych of might, you bee myne, eych wyght, ever to lyve in woe. A dowlefull death to you ys dight, for such hyre I you beheight when you served me daye and night, to be rewarded soe. Goe we forthe to hell in hye. Withowt end there shall you lye, for you have losteâright as did Iâ the blysse that lasteth ever. Judged you be to my bellye there endles sorrowe ys and noye. One thinge I tell you truelyeâ delyvered benne you never. DEMON SECUNDUS Naye, maister, forgett not these theves two, for, by Mahound, the shall not goe! Theire deedes, lord, amonge moe, soone I can them spye. This justice, lord, was ever thy foe, but falsehood to further hee was ever throo. Therefore deeme him to sorrowe and woe, for hee ys full well worthye. This marchant also that standeth here, hee ys myne, withowten were. As oftetymes hee him forswere as seedes be in my secke. And occurre also used hee that my powche ys so heavye, I sweare by Mahound so free, hit well-nye breakes my necke. Tunc demones exportabunt eos, et venient quatuor evangelistae. MATTHEUS I, Matthewe, of this beare wytnes, for in my gospell I wrotte expresse this that my lord of his goodnesse hath rehearsed here. And by mee all were warned before to save theire soules evermore that nowe through lykinge the benne lore and damned to fyre in feare. MARCUS I, Marke, nowe appartlye saye that warned they were by manye a waye theire lyvinge how the should araye, heaven-blysse to recover; so that excuse them they ne maye that they benne worthye, in good faye, to suffer they doome given todaye and damned to be ever. LUCAS And I, Luke, on yearth lyvinge, my lordes workes in everyethinge I wrote and taught through my cunnynge that all men knowe might. And therefore I saye, forsooth iwys, excusation none there ys. Agaynst my talkinge they dyd amysse. This donne, yt goeth aright. JOHANNES And I, John the Evangeliste, beare wytnes of thinges that I wyste to which they might full well have truste and not have donne amysse. And all that ever my lord sayth here, I wrote yt in my mannere. Therfore, excuse you, withowten were, I may not well, iwysse. Finis</field>
