      <field name="fulltext">The Author to his Honorable Friends. Think mee not proud as poor, when you shall see I borrow not in my necessity. And should I steal, (though common in this age) I should (by some) be trap't in every page. Then hue and cry comes forth, swiftly pursu'd At length I'me taken, guiltie found, and mew'd. Now, as for Justice, (faith) I'me like to finde Her, like Fortune muffled, if not stark blinde. All Deprecations then, when deprehended, Little availe mee; The Judge ascended Appears two Critick wouldbees, point blank swears That all the wit they found about mee's theirs. Which grant it were, let it be prais'd by sence, And 'twill be found not worth 'bove thirteen pence, Which wants of halter proof. Now 'twere ill done To hang a man ne're rob'd 'twixt sun and sun. Nor have I stoln by night, (as I can think) Unlesse 'twere home to bed full fraight with drink. But such, as wanted virtue to infuse The Heliconian fire into my Muse. I know you'l guess what beer and ale can do, Where daily care's had to procure that too. My Jury now (might I but choose) should be Such as hath liv'd high, and know miserie. And if such quit mee not, I'm sure they'l say, 'Twas (partly) want of money spoyl'd my play. Since Ile not steal, nor borrow, give mee wit; 'Tis in your power to make mee purchase it. I cannot blush to own what comes from friends, Give, and forgive, I have obtein'd my Ends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. Enter Adrastus, looking on his watch. Adrastus. My Youths have forfeited their pottle; 'Tis almost ten of clock. âEnter Book-cryer. Book. Come new new new new Who buyes my new books here? Adrast. What books, have you got there, Sirrah? Book. Newly come forth, and newly printed. Why (Sir!) here is, how conspicuously the Hogans are conculcated by their own Adulation. Adrast. Those are hard words, Sirrah. Book. But altogether in fashion, I can assure you, Sir. Adrast. Not with those that understand them not. Book. Sir, you do most prodigiously mistake; there being an order they should passe without exception where there is the spirit of pronunciation. Adrast. Pray let me have more facetious language, and lesse of your spirit. Book. Sir, I know your minde, And shall endeavour to pleasure you presently. Let mee see, here is A true, perfect, and exact account of Justice Dapper, and his Clark's Sodomitical revenue, to the great disabling, and impoverishing the Active, and well-affected Females. Adrast. Come give mee that, what others have you? Book. Why here is another, of a famous Doctor's miraculous obteining the Philosophers stone. Adrast. Doth your book speak how? Book. Yes Sir, that either the Stone, or a perfect receit to obtein it, was preserved in a wrack, and cast on this shore; which hee hath purchased, to the unspeakable content of all his beleevers. Adrast. What is the price of them both? Book. A groat Sir, I can assure you. Adrast. Sirrah, that's too much, here's three pence for you. Book. Why Sir? Justice Dapper, and his Clerk's revenue is worth three pence; And do you think the Philosophers Stone cost mee nothing. Adrast. Here Crackrope, here's your money. You make a brave trade of this, Sirrah. Book. In troth Sir, but a bare livelyhood; for where I get A penny by the Philosophers stone, there's Dapper and his Clark Gets ten pounds by the well-affected female. Adrast. 'Tis very probable; for they often for a touch Change Drosse into Gold. Farwell Sirrah. Book. Thank you good Master, I hope to have rare news for you next week. Come new new. who buyes my choise new new here? Pox on't. Here's a dispensation for oaths necessarie, sticks damnably on my hands; The people refusing to buy, as if they had it all by Rote.â Exit Book. Enter to Adrast. Albinus, Symphronio. Albin. Adrastus, good day to you: what, at your study thus early? Adrast. A study your neglect invited mee to spend my idle time. Albin. Tearm not that neglect (Dear friend) which wee'l confesse A fault of Drowsinesse. Adrast. Come, come, you are sluggards both. I hope you will confesse You have forfeited your pottle. Symph. VVee have. And when you please demand it; You'l finde us ready pay-masters. Albin. But what books were you so seriously meditating on? Adrast. Strange books, which wee'l peruse VVhen you shall pay your forfeits. Symph. It wants not much of noon, what think you of it now? Albin. I, I, let's march. Adrast. 'Tis sure too soon. Albin. Not to be merry, wee have been sad too long. Adrast. Then lead the way. Albin. Come let us walk Symphronio, 'tis wee must pay: Exeunt Omnes. Enter Gripeman and Sent-well. Gripe. Sent-well, mee thinks thou art not half so active as thou wer't wont. Sure thou art grown rich of late. Sent. 'Tis (as you say) of late, if I be rich. Gripe. 'Tis thy own fault thou art not. Thou art young, VVhen I was at thy years, I would have stirr'd my self i-faith, Such getting times as these. VVhy there is old Firmstand would make half a dozen of us. Sent. Yes, a weary with running up and down after him As I have done. I have followed him, like his shadow, Dayly this half year, and to no purpose. Gripe. Sentwell, you give mee no account of the five pounds You had of mee to furnish your Comrades That undertook to trap him. Sent. Had it been more 't had gone; I am out of purse an Angel About that businesse. You reckon still what you are out of purse, But do forget what I have brought you in. (I will not say by my just information) Gripe. I do remember, I do remember, Sent-well, But could wee trap old Firmstand, VVee might lye still and rest a moneth. Sent. Sir, I have tryed all wayes man could invent to undo him: Intruded into his company, not only once or twice, But times innumerable; And Proteus-like, varied my shape, And fac't him down that I was not my self. Yet hee, so cautious (still) in drink, or other waies, That not a syllable, tending to th'States abuse, I e're could hear him utter. Gripe. VVhy then wee must another way to work before hee leaves the town: Hee never (yet) saw Perjurus my Clark. Sent. Never, to my best of knowledge. Gripe. It must be so, Sent-well: Perjurus and you shall to his Lodging go; And under some pretence of businesse That Perjurus shall seem to have with him, Fall in discourse ot'h State. Sent. VVhich hee will hardly do, or if hee should, hee'l cautious be VVhat language hee delivers. Gripe. No matter, if that will not do, Perjurus and you shall swear. Sent. VVee heard him speak treason 'gainst the State. Gripe. Right, very right. Sent. Not so very right neither. Sir, you know mee to be your creature, But you have so slenderly rewarded mee for such like actions, I know not what to think on't. Gripe. No more, no more, all shall be well. I must away to see There's no injustice done about sharing the VViddows goods VVee caus'd to be plundered. Sent-well, let mee alone 'Bout eight of clock this evening to plot your businesse For old Firmstand; and for thy part, Thou shalt have trebble share. âExit Gripe. Sent. I think so too. The trebble Gallowes, if wee had our due.â Exit Sent. Enter Letesia, Clarathea, and Perjurus. Clarath. Mistresse, have you any acquaintance in the Change? Letes. Not I, Clarathea: Hast Thou? Clarath. Not I truely; but it matters not much, for I have often Found strangers to part with their Commodities At cheaper rates then those that would be thought our friends. Enter Adrast. Symph. Letes. You wagg, speak softly, or you'l be heard. Adrast. Now by the Gods I have not seen a rarer piece In all my travells. Symph. Beshrew mee but shee is handsom. Let's walk and observe her. Adrast. Dear Symphronios wait an opportunity to accost her maid, and know Her name and being.â Exit Letes. Clarath. and Perjurus. Symph. So quick, shee's gone, I'le follow her, and it shall go hard but I'le be Able to give you punctuall satisfaction.â Exit Symph. and enters immediately. But do you hear, you'l not be scrupulous to pay this debt, and pimp when flesh invites. Adrast. No, no, my friendship stand engaged. Symph. I'le take't, farewell.â Exit Symph. Adrast. I feel an unaccustomed qualm, I hope I am not caught. If I mistake not, she more then ordinarily eyed mee. VVhy how now Adrastus? have I stood the shock of so many sparkling eyes, to shrink now in thy prime of judgment? but 'twill away again I hope. Yet why may not shee deserve my love? I have made no vow that I have broke, nor ere prophan'd at Cupid's Altar: Venus assist me then, and let it work. Enter Albinus. Albin. Noble Adrastus, what all alone? where's Symphronio? Adrast. Faith I have imployed him in a businesse, hee'l not be scrupulous in telling thee. Enter Symphronio. Albin. See here hee is come. Sure 'twas some merry businesse hee looks so pleasant 'bout the mouth. Symphronio prethee make us partakers of your mirth. Symph. That you shall, just at the turning out ot'h change I gave the Maid a pull by the coat. Albin. VVhat Maid, in the name of Cupid? Symphr. Thou man of ignorance, be silent, and give ear. Shee turn'd about, and with a smiling countenance Told mee I was mistaken, they were not for my turn. Her Mistresse hearing her, look't back, and blush't, Then caus'd her man go forward. I, resolv'd not to return unsatisfied, fell on again, And with a civil Confidence told her I had a reasonable Request, shee, in two or three words could satisfie. At which she made a stand, and gave mee leave to ask her Mistresse Name, and dwelling. Shee readily answered, 'Twas more then shee had Commission for to do. Yet for that I look't like an honest Gentleman, (That could not harbor a dishonorable thought) she would.â Albin. hums by. Shee told mee her father,âAnd there shee stopt, and sigth'd, As if she thought him unworthy so heavenly a childe. At last shee brought it out, telling mee, her Master (Father to that Gentlewoman) was call'd Gripe-man; His dwelling in the High-street; And this his Daughter And onely childe, was named Letesia. I courteously thank't her, and so departed. Albin. Hey day, what stuffe's here? all this ceremony for a wench? You might have courted (with lesse ado) the holiest Sister in the City, and have sped too. Adrast. Peace, peace you wag; upon my soul shee is A virtuous creature. Albin. Prethe ingage not thy soul for the female sex, they are brittle ware. Adrast. Thou wouldst adore her sex during life, Did'st thou but see her face. Albin. Is it a friend of yours that hath the letting of her out, You so extoll her? Adrast. Leave jesting; By Jupiter I dare swear shee is virtuous; Would I had never seen her face. Albin. By Cupid hee is serious; nay if the winde blow there, Come, come, let's pack. No cure for love like a good cup of sack.â Ex. Om. Enter Letesia Clarathea. Letes. How now Clarathea, what taken up i'th streets by Gallants? Clarath. Not by Gallants, Mistresse; And for taking up the place Was not convenient; which had it been I should have saved him that labor, And have taken up for him. Letes. You should. Clarath. Faith like enough, had wee been both agreed. Letes. Thou art a mad soul, but faith deal truly with mee, What his businesse was. Clarath. Cannot you guess? Letes. 'Twere strange I should; Do'st take mee for a Witch? Clarath. No I'le besworn, nor I beleeve hee neither; for if hee had, Hee would not have so earnestly enquired after you. Letes. After mee? Clarath. Even so; his businesse was to know your name and habitation. Letes. Prethee wench be serious. Clarath. By my maiden-head 'tis truth. Letes. That's but a ticklish oath, may I beleeve it? Clarath. Seriously, most true. Letes. And didst thou tell him? Clarath. I did indeed. Letes. Urg'd hee to know no more? Clarath. But onely so. 'Tis your father calls, Away.â Ex. Omnes. Enter Riggle, Sodome following her, and Mettle following him. Sod. That Lady should be right by her swimming gate. I am provok't, and must have ease.â calls. Sister, sister, his't, his't, why sister. Rigg. Would you ought with mee, Sir? Sod. Lady, 'tis dark. Rigg. 'Tis very true Sir! Can you make it lighter? Mett. You may with standing on your head; For there's no doubt you burn below.â aside. Sod. My directions (Fair Lady!) will be No stumbling block to you. Mett.

Why Sir? some hour since making enquiry for my master, (Though somewhat dark) I could discover a zealous Brother In hot pursuit of a wench; hee followed her, I followed him: at length with complementall language Hee assaulted her, who seemed somewhat shy at first; At last, pretending earnest occasions for her excuse this night, Shee engaged to morrow evening to meet him, 'twixt four and five. The bargain driven thus, they parted severall waies. I followed the wench, and pretending my self to be his man, Told her, my master had considered, and would request her The meeting might be by three ith' afternoon. Albin. What design hadst thou in that? Mett. Sir, as thus: That if in case you and my master Fancy a scene of mirth, I'le bring you to the place By three oth' clock, where (without doubt) You'l finde her. Then you have time enough before hee comes, For to contrive (which without doubt shee will consent to) Some punishment fits your mirth, and worthy so base an abuser Of the Common-wealth. Albin.

Prethee Adrastus, ingeniously tell mee, Doth not this wench, this shee fayrie-female trouble thee? Thou wer't not wont to be thus off the hooks. Adrast. Wilt thou not laugh at mee, if I should confesse? Albin. Faith no: I ever could distinguish between a friend Seriously deserving pitie, and objects fit for laughter. Adrast. I know not what you call being in love, But if I not enjoy her, I must forget There can be joy on earth. Albin. Injoy? Do'st know what 'tis thou would'st injoy? Shee may be (for ought I can perceive) thou know'st Not worthy thy affection. Adrast. Can there be so much beauty Without a world of virtue and desert? Albin. Symphronio, you know her fathers house. Symph. If what her maid delivered to mee be true, I do. Albin. Adrastus, few hours will make known if she worthily deserve, Which when discovered, and that I finde her worthy thy affection, Imploy Thy Albinus: And if I faile to serve Thee, to my last drop of blood, May miserie enforce mee take up arms against My naturall Prince. Symph. The same, wish I; And I know nothing worse. Adrast. My noble friends, I thank you, and cordially beleeve you, What e're (through weaknesse) I deserve. Now for contrivance, how to obtein that happy houre Wherein I may reveal my thoughts to her, (none else being by) To mee appeares miraculous. Albin. That, I'le engage my life, you speedily shall do. Adrast. It is impossible, how can'st thou contrive it? It were a happinesse I dare not hope for. Albin. Be not too incredulous, this I'le perform, Or ne're draw sword again. Symph. My life for't, what hee undertakes, hee'l confidently Go through with. Adrast. O Symphronio, I know his will, would hee had power equall! Albin. I hope on the condition I do your businesse, you will Accompany us to morrow to Mettle's Wench and holy Brother. Adrast. I will, and what lies in mee to encrease your mirth I really shall act. Albin.

Om. Enter Letesia sol. How have I lost my liberty? Was ever Maid betrayed By her eyes as I have been? Dote on I know not what, or whom? Must I languish for what I know's impossible to obtain? Thy hopes, Letesia, at best, are but that hee is noble, and a single man. Suppose this be, where shall I finde him, or of whom enquire To ease my troubled soul? I may aswell search for a Diamond in the main Ocean lost, And hope (alike) to finde it. And yet, how much desirous is my troubled heart To entertain something like hope? Why should his friend (for sure hee must be so) Enquire after mee? give my Maid money for discovering My name and dwelling? All this is nothing, And yet it may be something: No it cannot neither; For 'twas his friend enquired, and sure his businesse Only concern'd himself. Letesia, Thy little hopes is dash't. But if his friend Come in his own behalf, I may enquire of him. And that will breed a jealousie, and may, suspecting Him his rivall, kill him, (which heaven forbid) That must not be. Enter Clarathea. Clarath. This is the third time I have taken you alone in melancholy postures. Venus grant you are not in love. Letes. In love, with what? Clarath. That (if you please) lyes in your breast to resolve mee. There is one of the pitifull'st holy brethren within To speak with your father, that ever eyes beheld. Letes. Know'st thou his businesse? Clarath. Not I, but something hee pretends to have with him Of much concernment. Letes. Know's my father of his being here? Clarath. Not yet. Letes. I'le then go call him. Clarath. See, see, they are here. Enter Gripe-man, and Albinus disguised. Albin. Good morrow to you, fair Mistris. Letes. The like to you, Sir. Gripe. Letesia leave us till I call you. Letes. I shall Sir.â Ex. Letesia and Clarathea. Gripe. Now when you please, begin your businesse. Albin. Sir, the common report of your just carriage in the holy cause You undertake, hath encouraged mee to make my case known To you, the well handling of which (I doubt not) but will Be very advantagious to us both. Gripe. You say wonderfull well, and to the purpose. Pray proceed. Albin. A repetition of such truths as I could justly deliver To your ample satisfaction how laboriously active I have been in the advancing this great cause, Would be too tedious for you to undergo the hearing of; Though my present condition must invite you to beleeve,â looks on himself. I have been rather not rewarded at all, then meanly. Gripe. Sir, it is beleeved. Pray proceed to your present businesse Now in hand. Albin. I shall. And, to be short, thus stands the case. There is (and not far hence) a wanting Gentleman Whose former rate of living being high, will easily be wrought The only instrument to work our ends, his acquaintance Being great with a young Gentleman hath long born Armes against us; And one that onely trusts this Gentleman with his absconded living. Now your promise that hee shall share (of what your Known Authoritie may easily wrack from him) I'le stand engaged, makes him your creature. A brace or two of thousands will not be hurtfull, And may be spared from twenty, which this my friend Will make appear, not only that hee is worth, But where it is. Gripe. Honestly spoken, very honestly spoken, and to the purpose, Home to the purpose. And let mee tell you, you need Not doubt, but that your care, and wisely managing a businesse So much concernes the generall Good, shall largely be Rewarded beyond your expectation; Beleeve it honest Gentleman it shall. Albin. Sir, I doubt it not. But for my friend, when hee hath Discovered what wee can wish to know, Wee'l hold him to't. Gripe. Right, right, our shares will mount the higher. Albin. The rest I have to say, is, That I could wish, And heartily, you would delay no time in being known To this same Gentleman. Your summons shall procure His presence here, or where else you please at two Houres warning. Though (if my poor advice may stand) I think your house the only place. Gripe. By any means my house, Sir. And let mee intreat you Make it yours, and your friends. Faith, what think you Of a piece of Beef, and bring your friend? Come, come, you shall dine with mee to day. Clarathea, Clarathea, âhee calls. Fetch mee a pinte of sack, and call Letesia in. âEnter Clarathea. That baggage will have the green sicknesse, Shee's spoil'd for want of exercise. Clarath. Sir, will you have a whole pinte? Gripe. No words be gone, I say a whole pinte. Clarath. Miraculous! hee is not long lived sure. Ex. Clarath. Albin. Well Sir, since you will have it so, I have considered, Wee'l be your guest.â Enter Letesia. Gripe. And welcom, heartily welcom honest Gentleman. Letesia, take special notice of this Gentleman and his friend, that when they come, You bid them welcom, as my poor house can make them, They will deserve your acquaintance and respect. Letes. Sir, your commands, and their desert will merit much more Then I can be serviceable in. But, to my power, I'le labour to deserve From both forgivenesse. Albin. Such Angels of light, are onely capable of forgiving What wee poor mortals trespass. Gripe. No more, no more: Beshrow mee Sir, this savours of the Court. Albin. Pray Sir, let your charitie extend so far, to credit mee, I hated much that Idol. âEnter Clarathea with wine. Gripe. Well said wench, Fill, fill. Sir, here's to you, and your noble friend. Albin. Thank you, worthy Sir. Health to you. Fairest Mistris. Letes. Your servant, Sir. Albin. Lady, you cannot drink. Gripe. Shee is a very pingler, a very pingler. Come Sir, t'other cup to you. Albin. Thank you Generous Sir. âDrinks. Verily it is more of the creature, then I have So liberally tasted (in a fore-noon) This sanctified ten years. Gripe. Sir, time (at present) is pretious with mee, having a very Great influence on the affairs of this Country, And must take leave, but shall not fail you at the hour of twelve. Albin. Till when, I humbly take my leave. Fair Mistris your faithfull servant. âEx. Albin. Gripe. Letesia, I have invited this Gentleman and his friend To dine with mee to day, let us have some things extraordinarie, 'Twill not be lost: so good morrow, Girle. Ex. Gripe. Letes. I do beleeve so: you seldom do invite those you loose by. You Powers above! lay not your heavy judgments on a feeble Maid for her fathers sins; For I much fear the crooked Paths hee treads, portend our house no good. Just Powers! protect the innocent. Exit Letesia. Enter Adrastus, Symphronio, Mettle, Drawer, as in a Tavern. Draw. What wine is it, Gentlemen? Symph. Your best Canarie. Draw. I'le draw you a pinte of the best ith' town, Sir. Ex. Drawer. Symph. Adrastus, what is't a clock by your watch? Adrast. 'Tis somewhat more then nine. âlooks in his watch. Albinus promised to be here before noon. Symph. My life on't, that hee'l perform. And were you not Acquainted with his change of habit, I am confident You would not know him. Adrast. Is hee so metamorphosed? Symph. As e're man was: Hee looks so like a factious Brother, That the Synod, though utterly against any enjoying Pluralities but themselves, could not lesse bestow upon him Then three Benefices. Adrast. 'Twere rare sport to be a spectator how hee behaves himself. Symph. Wee shall have that at large when he returns. Enter Drawer with wine. Draw. Sir, there is one below desires to speak with you. Adrast. Why didst not bid him come up? Draw. Faith (Sir!) hee looks so like a factious Brother, I thought you'd be offended. Adrast. Go prethee bid him come up. Exit Drawer. Symph. 'Tis hee; wee must take no notice who hee is Before the Drawer. Adrast. By no means. Enter Albinus and Drawer. Albin. Save you, Gentlemen. Adrast. You are welcom, Sir! I am glad to see you well. Pray sit down. Drawer, reach a chair. And how doth our noble friend? Drawer is call'd without. Draw. I come, I come; Anon, anon, Sir. Ex. Drawer. Albin. In perfect health; And how, and how, Gentlemen? Faith, how do you like my shape? Adrast. I hardly can beleeve that thou can'st be Albinus. Albin. Very likely; nor that you are (this day) to dine with Letesia Your fair Mistris. Adrast. Yes; that I shall be to dine with her I doubt not. Albin. Thou man of little faith. Mettle, fill mee a glasse of sack. Mett. Here (Sir!) here's wine. Albin. Here Symphronio, here's to Hollands Master-piece. Adrast. You are very merry Albinus. Albin. And so may you be if you please, I am sure you have cause enough. Adrast. Prethee Mad cap be serious, Didst thou see her? Albin. Yes, by this flesh and blood did I, and feel her too; Had I not loved thee well, I had become my own petitioner And deceived thy trust. Adrast. Dear Albinus, be serious; And let mee know The event of thy proceedings. Albin. Mark then, and rejoice, for by our friendship I'le utter nought but truth. Adrast. Then I beleeve thee; Prethee proceed. Albin. Then thus: This morning early (as well Symphronio Can witnesse) I parted with him, And as hee directed, Towards Gripe-mans house I steered my course. Where when arrived, and knocking at the door, There comes a wench, demanding what my businesse was. I, in a zealous tone (as if I had worn my own clothes) Told her, I desired to speak with her Master; (whose condition, I had ever a pinte of wine with a poor botcher, his neer Neighbour, sufficiently enquired) she intreated mee come in, Telling mee, her Master (shee thought) was ready, but not Come down. Away shee went, and no sooner gone, But down comes a bad father (for so I am given to understand) To a most virtuous childe. I told him I had a businesse To impart that much concerned him. Hee immediately Had mee into a handsom parlor, where I was blest With a sight of (I must confesse) your beauteous Mistris; (If e're my eyes beheld one) her father commanded his Daughter and Maid-servant forth the room, which they Obediently obeying, I began my story, which as wee go I'le tell you; for dine with him this day, I have engaged my self you shall. And this, dear friend, is truth. Adrast. I know not how to husband this poor life I hold To make thee satisfaction. Albin. Nay, if you complement, I'le dis-engage my self again. Adrast. Thou know'st with thee I cannot. Come, wee'l knock off, and all go to my chamber. Albin. Where you must smug your self up for your encounter. Mettle, wee must not forget three of clock this afternoon, The whore must be remembred. Mett. And the rogue too, or I am much mistaken. Adrast. Mettle, pay you the reckoning; Come, let's go. Mett. I shall Sir. âEx. Omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Scene I. Enter Gripe-man, Adrastus, Albinus, and Letesia, as from dinner. Adrast. Sir, wee thank you for your noble entertainment, and shall as men You highly have obliged (to the uttermost of our poor power) Faithfully serve you. Gripe. Gentlemen, you are heartily welcom to such poor fare you have found, And what was amisse to day, Letesia, Pray let it be your care next time to mend. For (Gentlemen!) I shall expect you'l be my daily Guests. Sir, pray a word with you. âGripe. Albin. whisper aside. Adrast. Sir, wee humbly thank you, and rest your gratefull servants. Lady, content; wait on your fair soul. May I deserve the honoured title of your servant. Letes. Sir, I want a judgment to pay desert, yet never hated Where I ne're found any. Albin. Sir, be confident I shall not fail (speedily) To put it in execution. Gripe. I doubt it not. Adrast. Lady, the gratefull'st of your poor servants kisses your hand, And humbly takes his leave. Letes. Your servant, Sir.â Ex. Gripe. Adrast. Alb. 'Tis hee: You just Powers! that have vouchsafe't To hear the poor petitions of a distressed Virgin, Be still assisting the humblest of your hand-maids. What should his businesse with my father be? There must be strange pretences of large profit in it, They hardly else should be invited here. My youth, and unexperience I have in Cupid's school, Puts me in doubt of what I fane would credit. I do confesse (I blush to speak the rest) I eyed him more then Became my modesty to do; (I hope hee thought not so) And if I not mistake, his looks betrayed much more of love Then businesse with my father. Yes, yes, it must be so, And yet it may be otherwaies. Suppose (which Venus grant hee may) Hee love mee (if it be possible) as well as I love him, The hopes I have to enjoy him with consent of my father, is so little, Despair awaits that thought. His looks speaks too much of honesty to be rich enough, (as times go now) For his consent, No, no, Letesia, it must be one dares lift his hand Against his sacred Prince, (which sure hee dares not do) And by sinister waies hoard up unlawfull Wealth, Must (by my fathers choice) be made my Bridegroom. But I'le assoon imbrace a Leper, As tye my self to what my soul abhorres. Enter Clarathea. Clarath. What meditating, Mistris, who your noble Guest should be, You din'd with all to day? Letes. That requires but small study; They are men that come 'bout businesse to my father. Clarath. My maiden-head upon it, you will not finde it so. Letes. Why do'st thou laugh? Clarath. To think how you mistake. Letes. Prethee, unfold thy riddles, and let mee know thy thoughts. Clarath. Cannot you call to minde, you e're did see one Or both of them before? Letes. Never to my best of knowledge. Clarath. Why then I can assure you these are the very Gentlemen Wee saw ith' Change, the one of which enquired of mee Your name and dwelling. Letes. That cannot be, they were all Gentlemen. Clarath. If you examine strictly, so you'l finde these to be. For know, hee that wee took to be the pitifull holy brother, Is, in disguise, the Gentleman enquired of mee for you. Letes. It is impossible. Clarath. 'Tis so; That I should be mistaken. Letes. What should this mean, Clarathea? Canst thou guesse? Clarath. Yes, that one (for both I cannot think) Would fain make love to you. Letes. What e're it be (dear wench!) keep secret, Till time reveal the event. Clarath. Be confident of mee; for when Clarathea shall betray Your trust, may shee live neglected, And dye forgotten. âEx. Letes. Clarath. Enter Adrast. Symphr. as in a Tavern. Adrast. Symphronio, Your haste hath brought us hither an hour Before our time, and 'tis too soon to drink After so full a meal. Symph. 'Twas well considered; Let mee alone to drive away some Time without the help of Sack. Mettle hath perfectly got the part I gave him (if the Bulls pizill put him not out) And I have mine ex tempore. Adrast. Doth the Rogue know hee shall be basted? Symph. Gently, hee doe's: But I am resolved to try his utmost Patience; see here, they are come. âEnter Albin. and Mettle. Albinus, wee are resolved (Not knowing how wee may be encountred When our expected company arrives) to pass by drinking For half an hour. Mettle, you are perfect in the part I gave you. Mett. Sir, I have not con'd this three dayes, yet Dare prefume I am perfect. Symph. Well, look to't, you know your forfeit, if you but miss a word. Mett. If you are ready, come what will, I'le run the hazzard. Albin. But where are your properties? Mett. For those, I shall furnish my self below. âEx. Mettle. Albin.

Mettle in an old black gown seats himself behinde a curtain, with some books, pen, ink, and paper before him, personating Phanaticus a Priest. Symphronio standing behinde the hangings till his cue to Enter, personating Fly-blow a Butcher. Mettle drawes the curtain, and turnes over some accounts. Phanat. Let mee see, let mee see, gotten this week by incomes From Mistris Dunce a Common-Council mans wife,âThree pounds, a gold Ring two silver spoons worth thirty seven shillings. From Mistris Zeal widdow,âforty shillings. From Mistris Tartwit a Cooks wife,âthree pounds. From Mistris Fat a Tanners wife,âfifty shillings. From Mistris Plume Feather-woman and widdow,âone pound ten. From Mistris Grease a Tallow-chandlers wife,âone pound two. From Mistris Error widdow,âforty shillings. From Mistris Extortion a Broakers wife,âTaffetie to line a cloak. From Goodwife Shuttle a gifted Weavers wife,âtwo fat Geese. From Mistris Fly-blow a Butchers wifeâa silver bowle worth three pounds. Why here is nineteen pound, nineteen shillings got with much ease. How willing these poor soules, in body, and in purse, Are to contribute to the Elect! For (to say truth) wee are chosen, but 'tis to cozen them. I must abscond: My spiritual exercise grows too laborious. O for a Cornish Curate from beyond sea, to officiate in my Absence but for one moneth! Would they forbear mee on the seventh day, I should rub out Much longer, and please much higher on the week dayes. But to stand two hours spending (to no purpose) is too much. Symphronio personating Fly-blow, knocks at Phanaticus his door. Who's there? Upon my life another client. A Greek or Hebrew book displayed doe's well. spreads open some books. Fly. Here's one desires admittance to you. Phanat. Who would you speak withall? Fly. With your reverend self, divine Sir. Phanat. O hee is right, hee is right. âopens the door, Fly-blow enters. Come in, Friend. Fly. Save you, holy man. Phanat. You also: What may your businesse be? Fly. A scruple Sir of conscience, I fain would be desolved in. Phanat. Resolved, you would say, friend. Fly. 'Tis very right, resolved I fain would be. Phanat. Time with the Elect is pretious, but to such good works As these wee are called; Friend, open your case. Fly. Sir, I am poor, but however have brought that with mee, That shall show I am willing (to my utmost strength, And abilitie) to give you satisfaction for your pains. Phanat. Honestly spoken, very honestly spoken, And conscientiously; pray begin. Fly. Then thus I shall discover my secrets to you. I finde my self (of late) much given to rebellion, Towards a poor woman, yet, young and lustie. A neighbours wife of mine, who (I fear) if I enjoy, Will lye very heavy on mee. Now, Sir, I have endeavoured to become a true Subject to my self, but finding my endeavours no way prevalent, I shall desire to be resolved, how farre Your dispensation (shee being none of the Elect) Will extend towards the satisfying our venial desires. Phanat. How far inclinable to your desires finde you our Sister? Fly. Verily Sir, comfortably enclining. Phanat. Is her husband of able body for the procreation of the Elect? Fly. That case is doubtfull, and much to be fear'd, Hee having known her this two year and upward Without fruit thereof; The woman having ever been laboriously endeavouring. Phanat. Brother, enough, enough, I say. I have with attention heard you; and shall (as considering It my own case) instruct you for your best advantage Both of soul and body. As for your rebellion, if your cause be wholesomly Advantagious to your profit, you may rebell, As many others, and my self (at present) do. But so to rebell, as of necessitie must be prejudiciall to you (Our sister being impoverish't) I shall advise you to take This comfortable admonition from mee, which is, That you put on the Armour of Providence, And cleave to a more beneficiall sister. Fly. Divine Sir, I thank you; and do begin to finde your Wholsom and comfortable admonition effectually to operate. And that you may perceive, I came not altogether unfurnish't With what, I hope, shall (in some reasonable measure) Satisfie you. âFly. layes off his cloak and discovers a Bulls pizil. Phanat. Good Sir, I doubt it not. Fly. You shall not need; Behold this ell of mettle, âadvanceth his pizil. 'Tis a good one: the Bull it once belong'd to Cost mee eight pounds. Marry, I shall give nine for yours, if you waste it not Too much in the service of the Elect. Phanat. Sir, what's your meaning? Fly. That you shall soon discover. Now hear mee with attention: Thou Metropolitan Imp of Satan, Monster of mankinde, Thou compound of Fornication and Adultery. Nay, nay, stir not, nor let nothing of noise come from Thy perjur'd tongue, which know can mollifie as much as tears can rocks. Now, in a softly tone, answer mee (if it be possible) nothing but truth (A thing by thee rarely uttered) to what I shall demand. You know one Fly-blow a Butchers wife. Phanat. Fly-blow, Sir? Fly. Yes Fly-blow Sir. Know, wretched miscreant, shee hath discovered Thy black soul to mee; and should'st thou but utter one False syllable to those known truths I shall ask from thee, By all the Gods, I'le adde to my intended fury, and geld thee. Phanat. Forbid, you Powers, geld mee; I am undone then. Sir, I shall confesse any I know, you please to ask mee. Good Sir, be merciful. Geld mee. Fly. If truth so long forgotten by thee can be again remembred, You may be merciful to your self, and save your Dowcets. Phanat. Thank you, good Sir; and be confident, what you shall Please demand within the power of my utmost knowledg, You fully shall be satisfied. Fly. Then to the purpose: How long have you been acquainted With Mistris Flye-blow? Phanat. Verily, I shall most punctually resolve you. Fly. Sirrah, answer me not in that sniv'ling tone You cheat the world with. Phanat. Why, Sir, it is some eight weeks and odd dayes Since first I did enjoy her. Fly. Villain, did you enjoy her then? Phanat. Pardon mee Sir, I mean no otherwaies then The sanctified company of a zealous sister. Fly. Alter that tone (I say) or I shall whetâ pulls out his knife, and offers to whet it at his steel hangs by his side. You understand the rest. Sirrah, be short; what money, and monies worth have you had Of her? For Villain, know, that misled Woman is my wife. Phanaticus starts. What do you start? (I must confesse, I blush to own her) Come, be brief, and to a penny satisfie my demand, Or you grow fat, and sing well. Phanat. I understand you, Sir, and shall cast it up to a penny. Let mee see, my book will tell mee; let mee see,â turns over his book of accounts. The eleventh of August last,âtwenty shillings. August the eighteenth,âten shillings. The second of September,âforty shillings. The fourteenth of the same Moneth,âtwenty shillings. The first of October,âA silver bowle, to the value of three pounds. This is to a penny, what shee hath been pleased to bestow. Fly. And upon what tearmes did you receive it? Phanat. Meerly her charitie, for good And wholesom admonition. Fly. Indeed such admonition requires consideration, Which you shall have. Come, come, deposit What with your Mountebanck tricks You have juggled from her. Phanat.

Sure I have been cast into a sleep, and hung in some painted Cloth, to personate the prodigall. What's here? a paper pin'd upon my breast? Perhaps I am in Turkey, and this my price of sale. I must make bold to see how I am valued. âpulls the paper off from his breast, and reads. Here lies a fleshly saint did lately prank it, Instead of sheet, doe's pennance in a blanket. This may be all true, And I beleeve the Author might have writ To'st too. Yes, yes, it must be so, for I am pocky sore. They have given me purging comfits too, for I'me Damnable moist behinde; What company was I in?

'Tis strange, they should not be theeves, And stranger that any other should use mee thus. Here's all my money to a penny. I shall unfold this mysterie in time.

Who ever us'd mee thus, sure they dare not Speak of it, for fear I come to know it, and punish them. Drawer, how came I in this pickle? Draw. Do you not know, Sir? Sod. Not I; prethee, honest Drawer, tell mee, and I'le be thankfull to thee. Draw. Sir, I cannot tell, I do assure you. Sod. Who was in my company? Did you tend this rome? Draw. I did, and if I not mistake, there was three or four Gentlemen And a Gentlewoman. Sod. Know'st thou any of their names? Draw. Not I, nor can remember I e're saw any of them before. Sod. Where is my hat and cloak? Draw. I have them safe below. Sod. That's some comfort yet; how long stayed the company here? Draw. Four or five hours. Sod. Is the reckoning paid? Draw. Not a penny. Sod. Why did you let them go? Draw. What Authoritie had I to stay them? They gave mee charge of your hat and cloak, and said you lost the reckoning, Which you not being in a condition to deny, They gave mee charge of you, and went their way. Sod. What is to pay? Draw. A mark, within a penny. Sod. Fetch mee my hat and cloak, and here's your money. Draw. I shall, Sir. Ex. Drawer. Sod. This Drawer is a rogue, and privy to my sufferings, But I must hold my tongue, Enter Drawer. Draw. Sir, here is your cloak and hat. Sod. And here's your money. Draw. I hope, Sir, you will remember the Drawer. Sod. I would I had as much reason to remember you As you have mee, I made you rare sport, without all doubt. Here take your blanket, are not the corners stretch't? A very pretty wholesom way of purge, A plague of such Physitians.

To impart to your father. Letes. Truely, Sir, hee is abroad, but if you please to expose some Litle time to the hazzard of his comming home, You are most kindly welcome. Adrast. Virtuous fair, One I thanke you. And since your Noble soule hath deny'd to honour mee with this your Courtous invitation, Pardon mee, sweetest, if I endeavour Not to let slip these happy minuts, the Gods (for ought I know) Hath lent us to enjoy for our unmatchless happinesse.â Shee starts. Nay start not, sweetest fair One, I have no frightful Story to relate; I have forgot all things of horror Since I became unable (more) to serve My too much injur'd Prince. Letes. You have been then in these unhappy wars? Adrast. Pittie it had been, I should have lived to see my Prince Engaged, And I in debt to nature for my health And limbs, and been a looker on. Letes. You speak like one our Prince may justly call his Loyal subject; it had been happy wee had all been such. Adrast. Lady, so intirely I lov'd and honour'd you, (E're you delivered this your Loyall soule.) That were it (in nature possible) this might have added. Know then, I have escap't these wars, to be (by your virtuous selfe) Adjudg'd to live or dye. Can you love? love mee so, to make mee yours. Letes. Sir, 'tis a question, requires much more deliberation, then A suddaine answer. I must confess, it were a meanes To quench those flames (you do pretend to burn in) should I, And to a stranger to, so easie part, with what (so much) Concerns my life and honour? Adrast. Mistake me not, sweet saint, 'tis but a hope I beg, Which a small encouragement (from you) will make mee proud of. Nor can I possibly urge, or dare expect that satisfaction from you, That may impair your honour; let mee but hope, And it shall be a happy prologue to my ensuing story. Letes. Sir, The hope you can expect from mee, and I in honour give, Is this; I nothing see, but that your person, and your noble minde, Deserves a far more worthy wife then I can be. But, Sir, I have a father, whose choice I must prefer (in duty) If hee gives consent, 'tis probable I may not repent it. Adrast. You have with joy unspeakable transported mee Above the clouds, there let mee drop, my fall might be the greater. O! unsay that again; that very name of father hath chill'd my bloud, And sounds despair to my beguiling hopes. Too well, I know what choice your father aims at; Nor is fit you should obey him, where the choice hee makes Tends to your ruine. Can the Woolf and Lamb imbrace? Or can there be A sympathy, where nature hath made antipathy? Nor are you oblieged (by duty) to obey him in what's unjust. You know his soul is black with sin, Forgive mee, Dearest, That I am forc't to put you in minde, of what, I know, You gladly would forget. Can you expect to enjoy one happy hour With him, whose sole delight must be to hoard up wealth, Gotten by base sinister meanes. Besides the daily curses (for his sake) you'l have. Your door wash't too, with tears of Orphans, and such Oppressed poor, as hee shall hourly boast hee hath undone. For know, sweet Creature, the free accesse wee at this present have, To your fair self, is onely that wee will assist him In the ruine of a young Gentleman (for ought I know) Unborn; but as wee do pretend, knowing his griping way of gain, That I thereby might have the happy means To make my love known to you. I am a Gentleman, though (I must confesse) a husband Far unworthy so Angelical a Beauty. Nor have I to my wish (for your virtuous sake) means Worthy your acceptance. But what I have, (though not so poor to want) Shall be enjoyed by mee, onely to do you service. And as you are known to be your fathers Heir, You may suppose his wealth, more then your virtue, is what I aim at, Make mee but happy in your self, Let him enjoy his pelf; which, when I covet, May I live long forgotten of my friends, and loose your love, Which (with my life) must in one grave be buried. Letes. Sir, what you have said touching my fathers life, I could with tears wish were not true. And for your love to mee, I thank you, which (To my poor power) I'le labor to requite. Pray take this for present answer. Indeed, I am not well, and must retire; onely This, your language, I shall seriously weigh, and at our Next meeting resolve you more at large. So heavens preserve you.â Ex. Letesia. Adrast. Angels protect thee, sweetest of thy Sex.â Ex. Adrast. Enter Gripe-man, Sent-well, and Clarathea. Sent. Wee have been at Old Firmstand's Lodging, but to no purpose. Hee left the town three dayes since, but will return for certain Two dayes hence at furthest. Gripe. It was ill luck you mist him, but since his stay from town Will be so short, the matter is the lesse. Sent-well, here's money for your present wants, You must about a businesse presently for mee, You know the Golden-head. Sent. Very well, Sir. Gripe. There lyes a Gentleman, his name Adrastus, I think you have seen him. Sent. Marry have I, Sir. Gripe. So much the better: Be sure you dog him Forth his Lodging, and if you house him in a tavern (as ten to one you will) Use all the slights you can to Riggle into his company, VVhich, if you cannot do, be sure you take a rome, or wait so neer him, You may discover what their discourse is. And let mee know what you can gather this night; And if their plot (contrived) stand right, 'tis rare. I'le firk my youngsters when they come to share. Sent. Sir, I'le do my best, and doubt not to perform your will. Gripe. Go, go about it straight, make haste. âEx. Sent. Yes, yes, it must be so; Gripe. pulls out a letter. and reads it to himself. There's danger in delayes: The Girle Must from temptation, or shee's lost. Some few moneths more shee will be head-strong, And carve her own bits, which I'le in time prevent.â hee calls Letesia. Letesia. Enter Letesia. Letesia, here's newes for you. Your unkle Miser, writes old Avaritia, likes well of The match between his son and you. And that because hee would have you neer one another, Hee thinks it fit you should be at his house, And sojorn there a while, till things between us Fully are agreed on. You see, Girle, what a care I have of your well doing; My thoughts are often hammering about your good, When you full soundly sleep; young Avaritia Will make a wealthy husband for thee. Up with your trinkets, and prepare to go: Nay, no study, I have said it, and it must be so.â Ex. Gripe. Letes. Indeed it must not. Good Avaritia, match in your own Dunghill, it will avoid a bastard breed. Money makes men ador'd, faith not by mee; Virtue and honour crowns felicitie. Enter Clarathea. How now, Clarathea? Ar't sure Sent-well is imployed To pry into his actions? Clarath. Am I sure I live? I stood by when your father gave the charge, And the Villain undertook it greedily. Letes. How shall wee do to give Adrastus notice of it? This slave will discover else, they do delude my father, And then wee are all undone. Clarath. Why, faith, for once, (to do you service) I'le to His Lodging my self. I heard what directions my Master Gave him. Let mee alone to acquaint him with the plot; But now I think on't too, I'le not go neither. Letes. Dear wench, why not? Clarath. Why Faith, cause you'l be jealous. Letes. Prethee, leave thy jesting, by my life not I. Tis more then time thou wer't gone. Clarath. You have prevailed; and I resolved to venture.â Ex. Amb. Enter Atheos, richly clad, admiring himselfe. Marry, Sir, this is something like. I see my Taylor can fit mee without taking measure of my conscience. The same quantitie serves, how large so ever, Fools report 'tis streach't. What a handsom bug-bear it is, to 'fright men out of a happinesse, Their reason (wer't not enslaved, by doting on a world ith' moon, To recompence their pining Miserie) must prompt them to enjoy.â puts off his hat. Persist in beggary, do, and let your admired conscience (Ushered in with rags, and meagre chops) Attend you to your graves; Where (if your dust More brighter shine then mine) Be thankfull to the Glow-worm Let mee imbrace this world, till I forbear (For conscience sake) to enjoy, with full delights What lust unsatisfied desires. This dumb God I'le adore, Money, to thee I'le sacrifice, thou art my Deitie. How now, Rogastos? Enter Rogastos. How drawes the lungs of our new Government, The air of profit, (sweeter then are the Arabian winds) Into our garrison? Doth conscience (still) part freely with her outward Garments, trusting the soul for to re-cloath the body? Rogast. As yet they gallop to their sufferings, as wee can wish; Only the Lady that wee ravished, Hangs still an arse. Athe. Shee still continues firm in belief, It was the private Souldier. Rogast. Shee doe's; but wonders much there's no severer search To apprehend what (foolishly) shee tearmes her foes. Athe. For that wee shall (with fair pretences) gild Much thicker then her eyes can pierce. Rogast. As thus; the wrack shall force a guiltlesse prisoner To confesse the fact, which done before such Witnesses as soon shall publish it, Wee may (with safety) murder him, And it cryed up for Justice. Athe. Securely contrived, (my better Genius) and politickly; But wee'l forbear a while, to try what gentler Means may work upon her (easily) beguil'd faith, Which I shall make my study. Rogastos, haste, and give order the Foot Be all drawn out. That part oth' spoil wee seiz'd on last, I intend For to distribute to all an equal share, As well to those remained in garrison, As the party march't to take it. It will unanimously beget a will to Act What ever I prescribe. Rogast. Your judgment's deep and noble. What you command, I'le see (with carefull speed) Shall be performed. âEx. Rogast. Athe. Well, go thy waies, Conscience is mercifull, And troubles not thee. Why, here's a Proselyte newly converted to our side, Out-doe's us all in mischief. I can dispence to trot, in what some in the world Call sin, but love not to run off my legs too soon. Humanity commands mee hate the violence Of his tyranny, which (for our own ends) Wee must privately imbrace, how e're intend For to depresse his fury. 'Tis policie makes us conspicuous to the world, Which wee, with sly hypocrisie must Endeavour to consociate, and then this little World's our own. âEx. Atheos. Enter Adrastus, Albinus, Symphronio, and Mettle. Adrast. How am I obliged to fair Letesia for this discovery? Her virtue will redeem her fathers soul. Devoted pilgrims with their tears, Could not have cleans'd by prayer. Albin. Shee's thy own, Boy; this very act of her's Confirms it. Symph. Adrastus, wee must have gloves; and for her Garters, let Albinus and I alone. Adrast. Would it were come to that. Albin. Nay, if you cannot stay, Mettle knows where To help you to a cooler. Mett. Would I had one for you, as hot as I could wish. Why, Sir, do you think my Master wants a pimp? Albin. No, I'le besworn, as long as thou serv'st him. Adrast. Mettle, hee doe's abuse thee. Go see if thou Can'st discover such a person sneaking here about, Letesia's Maid describ'd, and bring mee word. Mett. I shall, Sir. âEx. Mettle. Albin. Letesia goes contrary to the rules at court. They chuse to entertain, such as may stand for foils to beauty. Were but that wench (shee keeps) trick't up like them, Shee would out-shine them all. Adrast. Mee thought shee did deliver her message to mee, Not like one bred to serve. Albin. What punishment shall wee invent, to inflict upon This Rogue, hath undertook to pry into our actions? Adrast. That must be thought on. VVhere shall wee dine to day? Symph. Faith, at some tavern, if but to see what This same Rogue dares do. Albin. Agreed. Enter Mettle. Adrast. What hast thou discovered? Mett. I have, Sir, a Rogue, mark't out for such designes, Ha's walk't some half a dozen turns about the door. You may easily know him, A short squat Villain, Crop't close to a large ear pendent, with a broad blew list, Crook't back't, splay feet, And a feared Conscience, Sables. Albin.

But, Mettle, Must not wee share ith' laughter of his sufferings? Mett. You shall, Sir, and be an Actor too. Adrast. Mettle, go you before: Bespeak a dish or two of meat Where wee last night sup't. Mett. I shall, Sir. Adrast. You two shall go the back way, and I'le take this. Symph. Come, Albinus, then wee'l take this. âEx. Om. Enter Letesia, Clarathea. Clarath. I dare say hee loves you; for when I had delivered My message to him (poor Gentleman!) o're-joyed, Hee knew not what to say. Till anon, collecting his scattered Spirits (ashamed I should take notice of his passion) Hee made mee this answer; Sweet heart! Pray (from mee) thank your fair Mistris for this Noble Courtesie: And let her know, the life I hold (Too poor a thing to part with in recompence of this great favour) Is onely by mee valued, but as 'tis her's to dispose of, I took my leave of him, And what I could to avoid it, hee forc't mee Take a peece, and bid mee tell you, Sometime this afternoon, hee would Not faile to wait on you. Letes. But art thou sure hee'l come? Clarath. Are you sure that you would have him come? So sure am I hee'l come. Letes. Dear wench! what (in this straight of trouble) shall I do? My father hath plotted with his brother Miser, That I must into countrey, there to be made sure To that most sordid wretch, young Avaritia. This must I be forc't to do, or study quick prevention. Clarath. Study? I understand nothing of study in it. Too well you know your fathers temper, Whose resolutions are unalterable. What then can you resolve, but bag and baggage (with Adrastus) To be gone to some secure place of safety? And you do not know, things being past his reach to compasse, how the Gods may work his alteration. âLetes. pauses. Letes. I have thought on't; And must conclude it so. I had rather marry an Ethiope, then one I shall be sham'd to own. You Gods above, forgive My disobedience to my father, which you well know, Virtue and honour both enjoin mee so. âEx. Om.

Mett. The Gods protect mee from such another sight of horror; Sure it has hurt your shoulders. Sent. What thing? what hurt? what, or whose Shoulders? Art thou not mad? Mett. Not yet; I do not know what such Another sight may do; For sure in a more horrid shape The Divel ne're appear'd. Sent. Do'st take mee for a Divel? Mett. You were not farre from one but now, When hee sat upon your shoulders. Sent. Upon my shoulders? Mett.

Farwell. âEx. Mettle. Sent.

Look, look, there it walks; speak to it (I say) It beckons thee to follow it: So, so, now 'tis gone, Just there it vanish't. Into what a cold clammy sweat 't has put mee? The Gods guard mee from such foul fiends. How do'st thou feel thy self? Sent. Sir, truely, not well. I am somewhat 'frighted At what, you say, you saw. Albin. It is impossible; Did'st thou not see, nor feel it. Sent. Not I, Sir, truly. Albin. 'Tis wondrous strange. Friend, look into thy conscience, and There search if unrevenged blood Cry not for justice. Sent. Truly, Sir, I never had a hand in murdering any body, I must confesse, many a poor soul I have undone. aside. Albin. Thy conscience be thy judge, which well examine, And I am confident you'l finde it clogg'd VVith fearfull crying sins. âEx. Albin. Sent. 'Tis true, 'tis true, they are crying sins indeed. These are no idle fancies; this Gentleman is a stranger too, And did but confirm what the former saw. Mee thinks my sins circle mee round, and in a ring Unmask't, appear each in their horrid shape. Gripe-man, (thou Author of my ruine) Thou now appear'st a monster. 'Curse on the time, I ever saw thy face. You Gods (above) forgive mee. 'Tis time well spent, My eyes being open (now) for to repent.

Albin: Let him do so, then seate her on the way, and bear her to some place of safety, in which we'l both assist you with our lives and fortunes. Adrast: Noble friends, I thank you. But that must not be the way, for first, her Father will not send her with a lesse guard then two, from whom, we cannot take her (with our security) without we take their lives (which all the Gods forbid) but they'le pursue us strictly. No, no, I have contrived a way much safer. You Albinus, (since you have pleased to proffer me (so fairly) your assistance.)

No sooner were we grown of yeers fit to be courted but we had Suiters store. My Father, as he was wealthy so he was neer enough, And aim'd to Match us to the ablest Men for means amongst us; not much regarding how our affections bended (the onely cause of this my present greif) Not two mile distant from my fathers house, there lived a vertuous Gentleman, had many children to bestow, and little to give with them. The eldest of his Sons loved me intirely well, and yet (truly) no more (I think) then I loved him. We, head strong in our affections, without consent of Parents joyn'd (in sight of all the Gods) our hearts, not (lawfully) to be divided, whilst my Father had resolved to Match me otherwayes. And not doubting my consent, had promised me to a rich misers Son, I had not seen bove twise (and that I thought too much.) My Father prest a speedy consummation of this Match, commanding me (with speed) for to prepare to be his Bride. Now Dearest Mrs: (you that know what love is) easily may guess, the affliction I groan'd under. Seeing no other remedy, I plainly told him I could not marry him. For that I had given my self away to one more worthy, (a story full of strangenesse unto him) who betwixt doubt of jest, and earnest, smild, but so, like watrish Sunshine fore a rainy Day. At last, perceiving t'was a truth I speak, fell to revile me with such language, my innocent thoughts ner' understood.

For which (for a time) my Father fled, but what with Friends, and mony soon wrought his pardon. I, much ado to be kept alive. At length recovering a little strength, in one of our Maids habuits, changing Apfia (for that's my name) into Clarathea, got hither, where t'was my happy fortune, in midst of miserie to be by you received.

But shall hereafter, be proud to call Thee my companion. Dispair not Clarathea, we may (yet) both be happy; And be confident, Letesia, can be Mistresse of nothing, but her Adrastus, but what Thou shalt command. Clarathe. Thanks Dearest Mistresse. Letesia.

And what I have unjustly from poor souls detain'd, I will restore, till all cry hold, they h've gaind.â Ex Enter three Souldiers. 1 Sould: Have you heard how the Councell of War hath disposed of the young Gallant that wounded our Lieutenant, t'was a shrewd hurt, t'was ten to one he had not kild him. 3 Sould: I hear he shall be hangd. 2 Sould: You are mistaken, for when he had his sentence to be hang'd, hating so base a Death, he prov'd he had been an Officer In the late war against us. And must be shot to death. Trust me, I pity him, he seems a gallant person. 1. Sould. Me thinks 'tis great injustice he should die, The Lieutenant (as the Chirurgion doth give in) being likely To recover. 2. Sould. 'Tis true, but since it is their pleasure he shall die What cannot they pretend to take away his life. They say he fell upon our Guard, and that (though not Discovered) he had more aid which fled, though I dare say, there's nothing of it true, could I but save his life I willingly would venture a limbe. 1. Sould. And he that shoots him, may his hands rot off for me. 2. Sould. Amen, say I. Come let's to the Parade, where we Shall know, what hour he dies, and who are Chose his marks men.â Ex. Om. Enter Atheos, Sol. My eyes have not beheld a more diviner shape. Her beauty hath inflamed me to that height, I must Injoy her, though I survive no minutes after. She dotes upon that slave that wounded my Lieutenant, for which He dies, for when she knows him dead, her love Like the affections of most women, will die with him. But should she continue obstinate, and hate me, as having Power to save his life, I then were further off obtaining My desiers. But I will court her high. Rich gifts are Baits, that beauty often bites at. Laborious cunning, With a weighty purse, in time will do it. If nothing will prevail, this follows next by course What I not fairly can, Ile do by force.â Ex. Enter Albin. Symph. Albin. I wonder much we hear not from Adrastus: I know no reason for it, I have been strangely troubled Since his departure, the Gods grant all be well. Symphronio: you shall along with me to old Gripemans To see if he continue in his Frantick fury. Besides we shall of Clarathea, understand what course He hath taken in search of his fair Daughter. Symph. Go when you will I am for you.â Enter Mettle. Albin. Mettle: I somewhat fear the goodness of thy news Thy looks betray some sad mischance.â Mett. weeps. Nay, if thou weep'st 'tis vain but to suspect it. Mett. 'Tis sad indeed. For if you make not haste, you'l never see My Master more alive. Symph. Is he so dangerously sick. Mett. No, Sir, he wants no health, this letter will take you offâ gives Albin. a Letter. From wondring at my language. Albin. He must not long out-live him, by whose means he falls.â Alb. reads. Symphronio peruse those sad contents.â Symph. reads. Come, come Symphronio: 'tis no time to grieve; But to resolve, what's to be done, where's fair Letesia: Mett. She is close prisoner in the Governour's house, And none but such as he appoints, comes near her. Albin. Poor Gentlewoman, I will redeem thy Adrastus Or perish in the attempt. Symphronio: I shall intreat thee, stay (yet) a while In Town, and visit Gripeman as my Brother: The rest contrive thy self, onely to see what course He steeres to finde his Daughter. Clarathea shall along with me, her present service May stand Letesia: in some sted. And be confident, you shall (by Mettle) speedily hear From me, how all things stands. For so it may fall out, that you may do great servis For Adrastus here. Mettle: run to Clarathea: tell her, she must provide (Immediately) to go along with me to her Mistress. Mett. I shall Sir,â Ex. Mett. Symph. Since you conceive my stay may be afurtherance to my Distressed friend, I faithfully shall study (here) to act Whatever your directions shall imploy me in, Albin. Thanks noble Symphronio: Fare thee well. My brains are all on fire. I long to act, what, I in heart desireâ Ex. Am. Enter Atheos, Letesia. Athe. Lady, you do exceed in grief, you wrong your beauty To lament for what's not in your power to remedy: He is but a man you grieve for: And there are more It'h World as handsomely active as he. Clear those fair eyes, and tell me, if my self (I must confess unworthy) may deserve your love. Letesi. Do you love me then. Athe. My actions (fair one,) shall satisfie that doubt. Letesi. I take you at your word, then set my husband free. Athe. That's not within the compass of my power to do. Letesi. You are a dissembler, and prophane the name of Love. This is not nobly done to triumph over a weak woman, (Through her ill fate) your slave. The conquest you will gain by't, may well be added Amongst the Trophies of your great victories Achiev'd in this rebellion. Athe. Lady, the usage you have found (and from a stranger too) Deserves more civil language. But i'le forget it. And doubt not, this foolish passion over, But you'l consider, and be sorry for it. Letesi. Never. For know, lay it in thy power to make me empress Of the World. I would not out-live my husband Many hours to injoy it. Athe. Lady. I see this is no time to urge a serious answer from you. But yet remember, you are in my power, and (if you please) You may be happy. Think on it. So fare you well.â Ex. Atheos. Letesia. Where am I, or of whom can I expect relief. Was ever wretched creature so miserably unhappy as I am. And shall Letesia live, and my Adrastus die, And I his murderer? Thou might'st have lived brave soul the patern (still) Of virtue. But I have robb'd the World of such a juel The Gods esteem'd too rich, to bless this earth with. I must (in justice) sacrifice my life to him that I have ruin'd, For on my knees (before the gods) I vowâ she kneels: When I shall understand his death, caused by this Act of mine, one hour not to out-live him. There is no hope of mercy (on honourable tearms) From such a heap of sin, as this. Was ever woman courted (by a villain) to her dishonour Just in the act of murdering her husband? And shall I not revenge thy death (brave soul) It is decreed. That hand that murders thee, that heart shall bleed.â Ex. Letesia. Enter Albinus, and Clarathea, both disguised Albin. Could'st thou (Clarathea) readily finde the way to the House we came from. Clarath. Most undoubtedly I could. Albin. And give perfect directions to Letesia. Clarath. Such, as she shall not miss. But Sir, are you confident, they will be honest, in what (I must confess) they chearfully have undertook to be most secret in? Albin! O Clarathea. The woman was my Nurse, whose milk Innocent, as the Livory it wore, still sympathized With Loyal bloud. She can betray nothing But her own fear, how much she wants to do. Not suffer for her friends. Adrastus and Letesia's lives, thrown upon less assurance Might (though in their safeties) justly Have call'd me murderer. Prethee Clarathea: how do I look, May I not passâ turns him about, For currant, without a superscription written On my back, this is a Traitour? Clarath. You may. But Sir, the danger's great you undertake. Do'st thou consider mine, and slight thy own. Thou wonder of thy Sex. Thou mak'st me (blushing) To confess, that when I have paid my debt to friendship By laying down this inconsiderable life. I have but imitated thee, a woman. Clarath. Pardon me worthy Sir, I do confess, I may resolve, But yet, may stagger too, in the performance of such a piece of friendship Had I not a guide to light me, more strange Than is a blazing Star. Albin. It is too pitifully strange (indeed) to finde true friendship. Farewell (brave soul.) Be carefull of the hourâ takes her by the hand. And directions of the way. For Letesia's impatient Love, Should she but miss Adrastus: some few minutes, Might be occasion of their certain ruine. This kiss, so, farewell earthâ Kisses her. Our meetings next in Heaven.â Ex. Albinus. Clarath. And may the noble example of thy friendship Be as a Star to future ages To light them unto virtue.â Ex. Clarath. Enter Gripeman. Symphronio. Gripe. Sir, if I not mistake you are a stranger to me. What may your business be. Symph. Sir, I am brother to a Gentleman (made happy in your Acquaintance) his name Adrastus. Gripe. Away out of my sight, I know your business well. Sir, know, I have left those cursed ways, that would have Headlong hurried me to Hell. Be gone I say. And if you be his brother, tell him I do advise him To repent, and not betray his friends. Symph. This is strange, he is converted. I must another way to work.â Aside. Sir, you do mistake my business. My brother not being well, And sorry to think what he had undertaken, sent me To let you know his change of minde. And bade me tell you, in anything that's noble, and honest, He faithfully would serve you. But to betray a friend, or do an act unworthy, He would not for the World. Gripe. 'Tis honestly resolved, you now are welcom. I love your brother for it. Young man follow his steps. And covet not by base sinister ways to hoard up wealth, Least thou be Father but of one virtuous childe,â He weeps. And have that taken from thee. Symph. Sir, your tears hath easily gain'd credit in my belief It hath been your sad case. Gripe. Indeed it hath, and could I but injoy my Childe, I would (with comfortable tears) labour to wash My too bad sins away. But 't was my fault, seeking to match her to a covetious Wretch, she thus deserted me. Symph. Suppose, in this her time of absence, she should bestow Her self on a more noble choice, though not so rich, Could you forgive her, and (with joy) receive Your Childe again. Gripe. O worthy Sir, there's Musick in your tongue, receive her, Yes, next to the joys above, on earth, I know none like it. Symph. I am glad to hear you say so, And though I am a stranger, to your Daughters flight And place of being, keep your house, and I doubt not But ere long to be the happy bringer of the joyfull news Your Daughter's well, and shew you where she is. âEx. Symph. Gripe. Blessings go with thee, thou art my good Angel. How gracious are the Gods (so soon) to hear my prayers. The hope I have of what I would injoy, Hath made me young again. âEx. Gripe. Enter Adrastus, Albinus as in Prison. Adrast. Dear friend leave off to urge it. Canst thou believe Adrastus, values his wretched life At such a rate to purchase it with the loss of thine. I should be branded for a Coward upon record, should I accept it. No, no, Thou miracle of friendship, preserve thy noble life, To imploy it in thy Prince, and Countreys cause. There wants such guides to honour, and desert. Poor Letesia: I call the Gods to witness, were't not to part With thee, my death would be as welcom as my sleep. But since it is the pleasure of the Gods, we shall not here (On earth) injoy. I freely do bestow her on thee. Albinus, Take her, and be confident, thou wilt finde her worthy Thy acceptance. And may you live long, and happy And once a year, Water my sad remembrance with a tear. Albin. Pardon me Adrastus, for I must speak my thoughts. Your language, or religion, I am mistaken in. You would bequeath fair Letesia to me, your self Resolves to Murder. Hath she so ill deserved, For her return of Love, and loss of friends (Onely for your sake.) And will you requite her love With taking away her life. Adrast. Protect me innocence, I understand you not. Albin. You shall do then. For know, Letesia hath sworn Not many hours to out-live you, which shee'l perform Maugre, the Worlds resistance. Can you deny, to save that noble life, that hath engaged her Own (so far) for yours, and make her own white hands The instruments of her death. Be mercifull, if not for pitie, For shame of th'World, which will cry out in Ballads 'Gainst the Murder. Clarathea too (That faithful'lst of Servants) at the same time shift's cloaths with your Letesia: Who will not fail to meet you at the house appointed. Where should she miss you, her impatient Love might put The whole frame of our great business out of joynt. And, for that you do suppose, I loose my safety in preserving Yours, you much mistake, I have not gone so simply to work But I have secured that. Adrast. Make me but happy in that assurance. And il'e desire to live, if but to call thee friend. Albin. Know then, I have brib'd, some of your guard To assist me in my escape. Come, come, no words, withdraw, And let us shift our cloaths. Be confident in your going out, And no man can suspect you. Be sure, keep fresh in your remembrance, the directions To the house you meet at, as what most near concerns you. I cannot hear, therefore make no reply, No complements (dear friend) when death's so nigh.â Ex. Om. Enter Atheos, and Souldiers. Athe. Where stands the wind, 1. Sould. North East. Athe.

Go, and from me give them strickt charge they speedily Draw out all those commanded men I gave them order for. Ile have the prisoner shot before I put to Sea.â Ex. Athe. 3. Sould. Now what say you, you that were confident He should not die for this. 2. Sould. Why, I say I am sorry for it, and could almost die for him: There is no Justice he should suffer death for this; For what he did he was provok't too by uncivill language. 3. Sould. 'Tis all the Justice (now) in fashion, every man in office Makes his will, his Law. Were all the Souldiers In the Garrison of my minde, he should shoot him himself And that (I think) he dares not do, and Look him in the face, come let's go. âEx. Sould. Enter Atheos and Clarathea in Letesias habit. Athe. 'Tis your best way to tell me where she is gone. Clarath. It lies not in my power, or if it did, can you think I, that have undertaken thus much for her, will now betray her. Athe. Art' not afraid of Torture. Clarath. Not I, I can assure you, I came to undergo What you dare lay upon me. Athe. That's nobly spoken yet. Let me but this night enjoy thee And ile not onely forgive thee all, and set thee free our Garrison; But generously reward thee. Clarath. Sir, I thank you for your courteous proffer, but ile not buy My freedom at that rate, Had my Sister stayed (Perhaps) you might have had her consent. Athe. She jeers me.â aside. I do believe I should, was she your Sister then. Clarath. She was. Athe. And do you love her so well to die for her. Clarath. Indeed I do. Athe. Then speedily prepare, your time is short: Or will you (yet) consent, do but consider, what it is to live, Which weighed with what you foolishly deny, And you must yield in reason. Clarath. Indeed I must not, and when I do to save this wretched life. May all diseases mankinde hateth most Proclaim it on my fore-head. Enter 1. Souldier. Athe. So brave. 1. Sould.

And since you are so valiant you dare die, You shall have your desire. Souldier, run to the Goal And let the Gallant know, at five a clock this evening He dies. For, by my Tortured Soul, at my return from Sea, Ex. Sould. (Without you do repent, and yield to my desires) You both shall suffer death. Clarath. You'l ease me of a pain, ther's nothing else Can quit me from.â Ex. Om. Enter Adristus, Solus.

Conveighs the name of friend, and rests its self, As weary in the Toyling search Of what deserved that name. And shall my friend, (the worthiest of what deserves That Title) die to preserve my life. No. Dear Letesia: whom (by the Gods) I love, and value Next my honour, thou must excuse me. Too well (I know) Albinus did but pretend the way Of his own safety, to encourage me, in the securing mine. How soon that fatal sentence of his death May be pronounc'd, I know not. Something I must pretend to fair Letesia, of business For some time, which will be difficulty obtain'd. Forgive me (my Letesia) my honour is more than life Justice, and friendship (now) parts man, and wife.â Exit. Enter Albinus in Adrastus cloaths, and two Souldiers. Sould.

He shall not take me unprovided? Know'st thou what death, he is resolved I suffer 1. Sould. Shot, I believe Sir, for there's no order to the contrary. Albin. It is a noble death, I thank him for. 2.

Truly, Sir I know not, Enter Corporal. How now Corporal, know you the reason of this shout. Hark, the great Guns are fired too. Corpor. Yes, it is to welcom a Gentleman ashore That this day saved our Governour's life. 2. Sould. By what strange means, there was no storm at Sea. Corpor. No, no, 'twas thus. Our Governour, no sooner had put out to Sea, (Whether to take the air, or make himself Sea-sick, I know not) But a small Boat of Pirats, well mann'd With Musketeers, hid in a small creek, whipt out, And got between our shore and them. Who being far Too nimble for our Boat, having more Oars, Soon boarded them, who to save their lives were forc'd To yield. When (to the amazement of our Governour,) This Gentleman now landed, (and then their Captain) Clap't in our Governour's hand, a good broad sword, Bidding our men (if ever) now fight for Liberty, and injoy it. Himself giving a brave testimony to our doubtfull men By the death of two, or three of the chief Pyrats, that he was in earnest. This done, they all fell to it. The Pyrats distracted at this Surprisal, not knowing what to think (and less to do) The major part was soon cut off, the rest brought prisoners in. In this same skirmish, we had but two men hurt. And this brave Gentleman (the preserver of their lives) Received two wounds i'th' shoulder. Now you may judg, whether our Governor hath not just cause (nobly) to entertain this stranger. 2 Sould.
