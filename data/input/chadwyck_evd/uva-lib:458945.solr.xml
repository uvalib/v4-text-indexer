      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus Scæna Prima. Enter Rutillio, and Arnoldo. Rut. Why doe you grieve thus still? Arn. 'Twold melt a Marble And tame a savage man, to feele my fortune. Rut. What fortune? I have liv'd this 30. yeares And run through all these follies you call fortunes Yet never fixt on any good, and constant, But what I made my selfe: why should I grieve then, And that I may mould any way? Arn. You are wide still. Rut. You love a gentlewoman, a young handsome woman, I have lov'd a thousand, not so few. Arn. You are dispos'd. Rut. You hope to marry her; 'tis a lawfull calling And prettily esteem'd of, but take heed then, Take heed dear brother of a stranger fortune Then ere you felt yet; fortune my foe is a friend to it. Arn. 'Tis true I love, dearly, and truly love, A noble, vertuous, and most beauteous maid, And am belov'd againe. Rut. That's too much a conscience To love all these would run me out ô my wits. Arn. Prethee give eare, I am to marry her Rut. Dispatch it then, and I'le goe call the Piper. Arn. But ô the wicked Customes of this countrey The barbarous, most inhumane, damned Custome Rut. 'Tis true, to marry is a custome In the world; for looke you brother, Woo'd any man, stand plucking for the Ace of Harts, With one packe of cards all dayes on's life? Arn. You doe not Or else you purpose not to understand me Rut. Proceed, I will give eare. Arn. They have a Custome In this most beastly countrey, out upon't. Rut. Lets heare it first. Arn. That when a maid is contracted And ready for the tye o'th Church, the Governour, He that commands in chiefe, must have her maiden-head Or ransome it for mony at his pleasure. Rut. How might a man atchieve that place? a rare custome? An admirable rare custome: and none excepted? Arn. None, none. Rut. The rarer still: how could I lay about me? In this rare office? are they born to it, or chosen? Arn. Both equall damnable. Rut. Me thinks both excellent Would I were the next heire Arn. To this mad fortune Am I now come, my marriage is proclaim'd. And nothing can redeem me from this mischief, Rut. Shees very young; Arn. Yes. Rut. And faire I dare proclaime her Else mine eyes faile, Arn. Faire as the bud unblasted. Rut. I cannot blame him then if 'twere mine own case. I would not goe an ace lesse Arn. Fye Rutillio Why do you make your brothers misery Your sport and game? Rut. There is no pastime like it Arn. I look'd for your advice, your timely counsell, How to avoid this blow, not to be mockt at, And my afflictions jeer'd. Rut. I tell thee Arnoldo, An thou wert my Father, as thou art but my brother, My younger brother too, I must be merry And where there is a wench it can, a young wench, A handsome wench, and sooner a good turne too, An I were to be hangd, thus must I handle it. But you shall see Sir, I can change this habit To doe you any service; advise what you please, And see with what devotion I'le attend it? But yet me thinks, I am taken with this custome. Ent: Charino and Zenocia. And could pretend to'th place. Arn. Draw off a little? Here comes my Mistris and her Father. Rut. IA dainty wench; Woo'd might farme his Custome Char. My deare daughter, Now to bethink your selfe of new advice Will be too late, later this timelesse sorrow, No price, nor prayers, can infringe the fate Your beauty hath cast on you, my best Zenocia, Be rul'd by me, a Fathers care directs yee, Looke on the Count, looke cheerfully and sweetly; What though he have the power to possesse yee, To plucke your maiden honour, and then slight yee By custome, unresistable to enjoy you; Yet my sweet childe, so much your youth and goodness The beauty of your soule, and Saint-like modesty, Have wonne upon his wilde minde, so much charm'd him That all power laid aside, what Law allows him, Or suddain fires, kindled from those bright eyes, He sues to be your servant, fairly, nobly For ever to be tyed your faithfull Husband: Consider my best childe: Zeno. I have considered Char. The blessednesse that this breeds too, consider Besides your Fathers Honour, your own peace, The banishment for ever of this custome This base and barbarous use, for after once He has found the happinesse of holy marriage And what it is to grow up with one beauty, How he will scorne and kicke at such a heritage Left him by lust and lewd progenitors. All Virgins too, shall blesse your name, shall Saint it, And like so many Pilgrims goe to your shrine, When time has turn'd your beauty into ashes, Filld with your pious memory. Zeno. Good Father Hide not that bitter pill, I loth to swallow In such sweet words: Char. The Count's a handsome Gentleman, And having him, y'are certaine of a fortune, A high and noble fortune to attend you: Where if you fling your love upon this stranger This young Arnoldo, not knowing from what place Or honourable strain of blood he is sprung, you ventur All your owne sweets, and my long cares to nothing, Nor are you certaine of his faith; why may not that Wander as he does, every where? Zen. No more Sir; I must not heare, I dare not heare him wrongd thus, Vertue is never wounded, but I suffer. 'Tis an ill office in your age, a poore one, To judge thus weakly: and believe your selfe too, A weaker to betray your innocent daughter, To his intemp'rate, rude, and wilde embraces, She hates as Heaven hates falshood. Rut. A good wench, She sticks close to you Sir. Zeno. His faith uncertaine? The noblenesse his vertue springs from, doubted? De'e doubt tis day now? or when your body's perfect, Your stomacks well dispos'd, your pulses temperate, De'e doubt you are in health? I tell you Father, One houre of this mans goodnesse, this mans Noblenesse Put in the scale, against the Counts whole being, Forgive his lusts too, which are halfe his life, He could no more endure to hold weight with him; Arnoldoes very looks, are faire examples; His common and indifferent actions, Rules and strong ties of vertue: he has my first love, To him in sacred vow I have given this body, In him my mind inhabits. Rut. Good wench still Zen. And till he fling me off, as undeserving Which I confesse I am, of such a blessing, But would be loth to finde it so— Arn. O never; Never my happy Mistris, never, never, When your poor servant lives but in your favour, One foote it'h grave, the other shall not linger, What sacrifice of thanks, what age of service, What danger, of more dreadfull looke then death, What willing martyrdome to crown me constant May merit such a goodnesse, such a sweetnesse? A love so Nobly great, no power can ruine; Most blessed maid goe on, the gods that gave this, This pure unspotted love, the child of Heaven, In their own goodnesse, must preserve and save it And raise you a reward, beyond our recomp?ce; Zen. I aske but you, a pure maid to possesse, And then they have crownd my wishes: If I fall then Goe seek some better love, mine will debase you. Rut. A pretty innocent foole; well Governour, Though I think well of your custome, &amp; could wish my selfe For this night in your place, heartily wish it: Yet if you play not faire play, and above boord too, I have a foolish gin here, I say no more; I'le tell you what &amp; if your honours guts are not inchanted Arn. I should now chide you Sir, for so declining The goodnesse and the grace you have ever shewed me, And your own vertue too, in seeking rashly To violate that love heaven has appointed, To wrest your daughters thoughts, part that affection That both our hearts have tyed &amp; seek to give it, Rut. To a wild fellow, that would weary her; A Canniball, that feedes on the heads of maides, Then flings their bones and bodies to the Devil, Would any man of discretion venture such a gristle, To the rude clawes of such a Cat-a-mountain? You had better teare her between 2 Oaks, a Town bull Is a meer Stoick to this fellow, a grave Philosopher, And a Spanish Jennet, a most vertuous Gentleman. Arn. Does this seem handsome Sir? Rut. Though I confesse Any man would desire to have her, and by any meanes, At any rate too, yet that this common hang-man, That hath whipt off the heads of a 1000. maids already That he should gleane the harvest, sticks in my stomack: This rogue that breaks young wenches to the saddle, And teaches them to stumble ever after; That he should have her? for my brother now That is a handsome young fellow; and well thought on, And will deale tenderly in the businesse; Or for my selfe that have a reputation, And have studied the conclusions of these causes And know the perfect mannage, I'le tel you old Sir, If I should call you wise Sir, I should bely you, This thing you study to betray your child to. This Maiden-monger. When you have done your best And think you have fixt her in the point of honour Who do you think you have tyed her too? a Surgeon, I must confesse an excellent defector, One that has cut up more young tender Lamb-pies— Char. What I speake Gentlemen, was meer compulsion No Fathers free-will, nor did I touch your person, With any edge of spight; or straine your loves With any base, or hired perswasions; Exit. Witnesse thsee tears, how well I wisht your fortunes. Rut. Theres some grace in thee yet, you are determined, To marry this Count Lady, Zen. Marry him Rutillio? Rut. Marry him, and lye with him I meane, Zeno. You cannot meane that, If you be a true Gentleman, you dare not, The brother to this man, and one that loves him; I'le marry the Devill first Rut. A better choice And lay his hornes by a hansomer bedfellow, A cooler o' my conscience Arn. Pray let me aske you; And my deare Mistris, be not angry with me For what I shall propound, I am confident, No promise, nor no power, can force your love, I meane in way of marriage, never stirr you, Nor to forget my faith, no state can wound you. But for this custome, which this wretched country Hath wrought into a law, and must be satisfied; Where all the pleas of honour, are but laughed at, And modesty regarded as a may-game, What shall be here considered? power we have none, To make resistance, nor policie to crosse it: 'Tis held religion too, to pay this duty. Zeno. I'le dye an Atheist then. Arn. My noblest Mistris Not that I wish it so, but say it were so, Say you did render up, part of your honour, For whilst your will is cleare, all cannot perish; Say for one night, you entertained this monster Should I esteeme you worse, forc'd to this render? Your minde I know is pure, and full as beauteous; After this short eclipse, you would rise againe And shaking of that cloud, spred all your lustre Zeno. Who made you witty, to undoe your selfe, Sir? Or are you loden, with the love I bring you, And faine would fling that burthen on another? Am I growne common in your eyes Arnoldo? Old, or unworthy of your fellowship? Dee thinke because a woman, I must err, And therefore rather wish that fall before hand Coloured with custome, not to be resisted? Dee love as painters doe, onely some peices Some certaine handsome touches of your Mistris, And let the minde passe by you, unexamined? Be not abusd; with what the maiden vessell Is seasond first, you understand the proverbe. Rut. I am afraid, this thing will make me vertuous, Zeno. Should you lay by the least part of that love Y'aue sworne is mine, your youth &amp; faith has given me, To entertaine another, nay a fairer, And make the case thus desp'rate, she must dye else; D'ee thinke I would give way, or count this honest? Be not deceiv'd, these eyes should never see you more, This tongue forget to name you, and this heart Hate you, as if you were borne, my full Antipathie. Empire and more imperious love, alone Rule, and admit no rivalls, the purest springs When they are courted by lascivious land-floods, Their maiden purenesse, and their coolenesse perish. And though they purge againe to their first beauty, The sweetnesse of their taste, is cleane departed. I must have all or none; and am not worthy Longer the noble name of wife, Arnoldo, Then I can bring a whole hart pure &amp; handsom. Arnol. I never shall deserve you: not to thanke you; You are so heavenly good, no man can reach you: I am sorrie I spake so rashly, t'was but to try you. Rut. You might have tryed a thousnd women so, And 900, fourscore &amp; 19 should ha'followed your counsell Take heed o' clapping spurrs to such free cattell, Arn. We must bethinke us suddenly and constantly, And wisely too, we expect no common danger. Zen. Be most assur'd, I'le dye first. Enter Clodio and guard: Rut. An't come to that once, The Devill picke his bones, that dyes a coward I'le jog along with you, here comes the Stallion How smug he lookes upon the imagination Of what he hopes to act? pox on your kidnes, How they begin to melt? how big he beares Sure he will leape before us all: what a sweete company Of rogues and panders, wait upon his lewdnesse? Plague of your chops, you ha' more handsome bitts, Then a hundred honester men, and more deserving How the dogg leeres. Clod. You need not now be jealous I speake at distance to your wife, but when the Preist has done We shall grow nearer, and more familiar. Rut. I'le watch you for that tricke, baboone, I'le Smoke you: the rogue swets, as if he had eaten Graines, hee broyles, if I doe come to the Basting of you. Arno. Your Lordship. May happily speake this, to fright a stranger, But 'tis not in your honour, to performe it; The custome of this place, if such there be, At best most damnable, may vrge you to it, But if you be an honest man you hate it, How ever I will presently prepare To make her mine, and most undovbtedlye; Beleeve you are abus'd, this custome fain'd to, And what you now pretend, most faire and vertuous. Clod. Goe and beleeve, a good beleife does well Sir; And you Sir, cleare the place, but leave her here. Arn. Your Lordships pleasure Clod. That anon Arnoldo, This is but talke Rut. Shall we goe off? Arn. By any meanes I know she has pious thoughts enough to guard her Besides, heres nothing due to him till the tye be done Nor dare he offer. Rut. Now doe I long to worry him: Pray have a care to the main chance. Ex. Arn. and Rut. Zen. Pray Sir feare not Clod. Now, what say you to me? Zen. Sir it becomes The modestie, that maides are ever borne with, To use few words. Clod. Doe you see nothing in me Nothing to catch your eyes nothing of wonder, The common mould of men, come short, and want in? Doe you read no future fortune for your selfe here? And what a happinesse, it may be to you, To have him honour you, all women aime at? To have him love you Lady, that man love you, The best, and the most beauteous, have run mad for? Looke and be wise, you have a favour offerd you I doe not euery day propound to women; You are a prettie one: and though each hower, I am glutted, with the sacrifice of beautie, I may be brought, as you may handle it, To cast so good a grace and likeing on you, You understand, come kisse me, and be joyfull, I giue you leave. Zen. Faith Sir, twill not shew handsome; Our sex his blushing, full of feare, unskild too, In these alarums. Clod. Learne then and be perfect Zen. I doe beseech your honour pardon me, And take some skilfull one, can hold you play, I am a foole. Clod. I tell thee maide I love thee, Let that word make thee happie, so farr love thee, That though I may enjoy thee without ceremony, I will descend so lowe, to marry thee, Me thinkes I see the race, that shall spring from us, Some Princes, some great Souldiers Zen. I am afraid. Your honours couzen'd in this calculation; For certaine, I shall nere haue a child by you. Clod. Why? Zen. Because I must not thinke to marry you, I dare not Sir, the step betwixt your honour, And my poore humble State. Clod. I will descend to thee, And buoye thee up. Zen. I'le sinke to th'Center first, Why would your Lordship marry, and confine that pleasure, You ever have had freely cast upon you? Take heed my Lord this marring is a mad matter, Lighter a paire of sheckles will hang on you, And quieter a quartaine feaver finde you If you wed me I must enjoy you onely, Your eyes must be cald home, your thoughs in cages, To sing to no eares then but mine; your hart bound The custome, that your youth was euer nurst in, Must be forgot, I shall forget my duty else, And how that will appeare, Clod. Wee'le talke of that more Zen. Besides I tell yee, I am naturally, As all young women are, that shew like handsome, Exceeding proud, being c?mended, monstrous. Boy ready for the Songs Of an unquiet temper, seldome pleas'd. Unlesse it be with infinite observance. Which you were never bred to; once well angerd, As every crosse in us, provokes that passion, And like a Sea, I roule, tosse, and chafe a weeke after. And then all mischeife I can think upon, Abusing of your bed the least and poorest, I tell you what you'le finde, and in these fitts, This little beauty, you are pleased to honour, Will be so chang'd, so alterd to an uglinesse, To such a vizard, ten to one, I dye too, Take't then upon my death you murderd me, Clod. Away, away fool, why dost thou proclaime these To prevent that in me, thou hast chosen in another Zen. Him I have chosen, I can rule and master, Temper to what I please, you are a great one Of a strong will to bend, I dare not venture, Be wise my Lord, and say you were well counseld, Take mony for my ransome, and forget me, Twill be both safe, and noble for your honour, And wheresoever my fortunes shall conduct me, So worthy mentions I shall render of you So vertuous and so faire. Clod. You will not marry me: Zen. I doe beseech your honour, be not angry At what I say, I cannot love yee, dare not; But such a ransome, for the flowre you covet Clod. No money, nor no prayers, shall redeeme that, Not all the art you have Zen. Set your owne price Sir. Clod. Goe to your wedding, neuer kneel to me When that's done, you are mine, I will enjoy you: Your teares do nothing, I will not loose my custome To cast upon my selfe an Empires fortune Zen. My minde shall not pay this custome, cruel man Exit. Clod. Your body wil content me: I'le look for you, Ex. Enter Charino and servants in blackes. Covering the place with blackes. Char. Strew all your withered flowers, your Autumn sweets By the hot Sun ravisht of bud and beauty Thus round about her Bride-bed hang those blacks ther The emblemes of her honour lost; all joy Bowle of wine ready. That leades a Virgin to receive her Lover, Keepe from this place all fellow-maides that blesse her, And blushing and unloose her Zone, keep from her: No merry noise nor lusty songs be heard here, Nor ful cups crownd with wine, make the rooms giddy; This is no masque of mirth, but murdered honour. Sing mournfully that sad Epithalamion, I gave thee now: and prethee let thy Lute weepe. Song, Dance. Enter Rutillio. Rut. How now, what livery's this? doe you call this a wedding? This is more like a funerall. Char. It is one, And my poor Daughter going to her grave, To his most loth'd embraces that gapes for her. Make the Earles bed ready, is the marriage done Sir? Rut. Yes they are knit; but must this slubberdegullion Have her maiden-head now? Arn. Theres no avoyding it? Rut. And there's the scaffold where she must loose it. Arn. The bed sir? Rut. No way to wipe his mouldy chaps? Char. Thee we know Rut. To any honest wel-deserving fellow, And 'twere but to a merry Cobler, I could sit still now, I love the game so well, but that this puckfist, This universall rutter, fare ye well Sir; And if you have any good prayers, put 'em forward, There may be yet a remedy. Char. I wish it, Exit Rut. And all my best devotions offer to it. Enter Clodio and Guard. Clod. Now is this tye dispathc'd? Char. I thinke it be Sir: Clod. And my bed ready? wine Char. There you may quickly find Sir, Such a loth'd preparation. Clod. Never grumble, Nor fling a discontent upon my pleasure It must and shall be done: give me some wine, And fill it till it leape upon my lips: Here's to the foolish maidenhead you wot of, The toy I must take paines for Char. I beseech your Lord-ship Load not a Fathers love, Clod. Pledge it Charino, Or by my life I'le make thee pledge thy last And be sure she be a maid, a perfect Virgin, (I will not have my expectation dul'd) Or your old pate goes off. I am hot and fiery And my bloud beates alarums through my body And fancie high. You of my guard retire, And let me heare no noyse about the lodging But musick and sweet ayres, now fetch your daughter, And bid the coy wench put on all her beauties, All her enticements, out-blush damask roses, And dim the breaking East with her bright Christalls. I am all on fire, away Char. And I am frozen. Exit. Enter Zenocia with Bow and Quiver, an Arrow bent, Arnoldo and Rutillio after her, arm'd. Zen. Come fearelesse on Rut. Nay an I budge from thee Beate me with durty sticks. Clod. What Masque is this? What pretty fancy to provoke me high? The beauteous Huntresse, fairer far, and sweeter; Diana shewes an Ethiop to this beauty Protected by two Virgin Knights. Rut. That's a lye, A loud one, if you knew as much as I doe The guard's dispers'd Arn. Fortune I hope invites us Clod. I can no longer hold, she puls my heart from me Zen. Stand, &amp; stand sixt, move not a foote, nor speak not, For if thou doest, upon this point thy death sits. Thou miserable, base, and sordid lecher, Thou scum of noble blood, repent and speedily, Repent thy thousand thefts, from helplesse virgins, Their innocence betrayed to thy embraces. Arn. The base dishonour, that thou doest to strangers, In glorying to abuse the lawes of marriage, Thy Infamy thou hast flung upon thy countrey, In nourishing this black and barbarous custome Clod. My guard. Arn. One word more, and thou diest. Rut. One sillable That tends to any thing, but I beseech you, And as y'are Gentlemen tender my case, And I'le thrust my javeling downe thy throate Thou Dogg-whelpe, thou, pox upon thee, what Should I call the? Pompean, Thou kisse my Lady? thou scowr her chamber pot: Thou have a mayden head? a mottly coate, You great blinde foole, farewell and be hanged to yee, Loose no time Lady. Arn. Pray take your pleasure Sir, And so wee'l take our leaves Zen. We are determined, Dye, before yield Arn. Honour, and a faire grave Zen. Before a lustfull bed, so for our fortunes. Rut. Du cat a whee, good count, cry, preethe cry, O what a wench hast thou lost? cry you great booby. Exeunt Enter Charino. Clod. And is she gone then, am I dishonoured thus Cozend and baffuld? my guard there no man answer? My guard I say, Sirra you knew of this plott. Where are my guard? Ile ha' your life you villaine. Char. You politique oldth iefe. Heaven send her far enough Enter Guard. And let me paye the ransome. Guard. Did your honour call us? Clod. Post every way, and presently recover, The two strange Gentlemen, and the faire Lady, Guard. This day was married Sir. Clod. The same. Guard. We saw e'm Making with all maine speed to'th port. Clod. Away villains. Ex. Gard: Recover her, or I shall dye; deale truely, Didst not thou know, Char. By all thats good I did not If your honour meane their flight, to say I grieve for that, Will be to lye; you may handle me as you please. Clod. Be sure, with all the cruelty, with all the rigor, For thou hast robd mee villaine of a treasure. Enter Guard. How now? Guard. They'r all aboord, a bark rode ready for 'em, And now are under sayle and past recovery Clod. Rig me a ship with all the speed that may be, I will not loose her: thou her most false Father, Shalt go along; and if I misse her, heare me, Whole day will I studie to destroy thee. Char. I shall be joyfull of it; and so you'll finde me. Ex. omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Scæna prima. Enter Manuell du sosa. and Guiomar. Man. I heare, and see, too much of him, and that Compells me Madam, though unwillingly, To wish I had no uncles part in him, And much I feare, the comfort of a Son You will not long enjoy. Gui. 'Tis not my fault, And therefore from his guilt my innocence Cannot be taynted, since his Fathers death (Peace to his soule) a Mothers prayers and care, Were never wanting, in his education. His child-hood I passe, as being brought up Under my wing; and growing ripe for study, I overcame the tendernesse, and joye I had to looke upon him, and provided The choicest Masters, and of greatest name Of Salamanca, in all liberall Arts. Man. To train his youth up. I must witnesse that. Guio. How there he prospered, to the admiration, Of all that knew him, for a generall scholler, Being one of note, before he was a man, Is still remembred in that Academy, From thence I sent him to the Emperours court, Attended like his Fathers Sonne and there Maintaind him, in such bravery and height, As did become a courtier. Man. 'Twas that spoild him, my Nephew had beene hapy The court's a schoole indeed, in which some few Learne vertuous principles, but most forget, What ever they brought thither good and honest. Trifling is there in practice, serious actions, Are obsolete and out of use, my Nephew Had beene a happy man, had he ne're knowne What's there in grace, and fashion. Guio. I have heard yet, That while he liv'd in court, the Emperour Tooke notice of his carriage and good parts, The grandees did not scorne his company, And of the greatest Ladies he was held, A compleate Gentleman. Man. He indeed daunc'd well, A turne o'th toe, with a loftie tricke or two, To argue nimblenesse, and a strong backe, Will go farr with a Madam: 'tis most true, That hee's an excellent scholler, and he knowes it; An exact courtier, and he knowes that too; He has fought thrice, and come off still with honour, Which he forgets not Guio. Nor I have much reason. To greive his fortune that way, Man. You are mistaken, Prosperity does search a Gentlemans temper, More then his adverse fortune: I have knowen Many, and of rare parts from their successe In private duells, rais'd up to such a pride, And so transformed from what they were, that all That lov'd them truely, wish'd they had fallen in them. I need not write examples, in your sone, 'Tis too apparent; for ere Don Duarte, Made tryall of his valour, he indeed was Admired for civill courtesy, but now Hee's swolne so high, out of his owne assurance, Of what he dares do, that he seekes occasions, Unjust occasions, grounded on blinde passion, Ever to be in quarrels, and this makes him Shund of all faire societies. Guio. Would it were In my weake power to help it: I will use With my entreaties th'authority of a mother, As you may of an Vncle, and enlarge it With your command, as being a governor To the great King in Lisborne. Enter Duarte and his Page. Man. Here he comes. We are unseene, observe him. Dua. Boye Page. My Lord. Dua. What saith the spanish captaine that I strooke, To my bold challenge? Page. He refus'd to read it. Dua. Why didst not leave it there? Page. I did my Lord, But to no purpose, for he seemes more willing To sit downe with the wrongs, then to repaire His honour by the sword; he knowes too well, That from your Lordship nothing can be got But more blowes, and disgraces. Dua. Hee's a wretch, A miserable wretch, and all my furie Is lost upon him; holds the masque, appointed Ith' honour of Hippolita: Page. 'Tis broke off. Dua. The reason? Page. This was one, they heard your Lordship Was by the Ladies choise to lead the dance, And therefore they, too well assur'd how farr You would out shine e'm, gave it ore and saied They would not serve for foiles to set you off. Dua. They at their best are such, and ever shall be Where I appeare. Man. Doe you note his modestie? Dua. But was there nothing else pretended? Page. Yes, Young Don Alonzo, the great Captaines Nephew, Stood on comparisons. Dua. With whom? Page. With you, And openly profess'd, that all precedence, His birth and state considered, was due to him Nor were your Lordship to contend with one So farr above you. Dua. I looke downe upon him With such contempt and scorne, as on my slave, Hee's a name onely, and all good in him, He must derive, from his great grandures ashes, For had not their victorious acts bequeath'd, His titles to him, and wrot on his forehead, This is a Lord, he had liv'd unobserv'd By any man of marke, and died as one Among the common route, compaire with me? 'Tis giant-like ambition; I know him, And know my selfe, that man is truely noble, And he may justly call that worth his owne, Which his deserts have purchac'd, I could wish My birth were more obscure, my freinds and kinsmen Of lesser power, or that my provident Father, Had been like to that riotous Emperour That chose his belly for his onely heire; For being of no family then, and poore My vertues whereso'er I liv'd, should make That kingedome my inheritance. Guio. Strange selfe love Dua. For if I studied the countries lawes, I should so easily, sound all their depth, And rise up such a wonder, that the pleaders, That now are in most practice, and esteeme Should starve for want of clients: If I traveld, Like wise Vlysses to see men and manners, I would returne in act, more knowing, then Homer could fancie him; If a Physitian, So oft I would restore death wounded men, That where I liv'd, Gallen should not be nam'd, And he that joyn'd againe the scatterd limbs Of torne Hippolitus should be forgotten. I could teach Ovid courtship, how to win, A Julia, and enjoy her, though her dower Were all the Sun gives light to: and for armes Were the Persian host that drank up Rivers, added To the Turkes present powers, I could direct, Command, and marshall them. Man. And yet you know not To rule your selfe, you would not to a boy else Like Plautus Braggart boast thus. Dua. All I speake, In act I can make good, Guio. Why then being Master, Of such and so good parts doe you destroy them, With selfe opinion or like a rich miser, Hoard up the treasures you possess, imparting, Nor to your selfe nor others, the use of them? They are to you, but like inchanted viands, On which you seeme to feed, yet pine with hunger; And those so rare perfections in my son Which would make others happy, renders me A wretched Mother. Man. You are too insolent. And those too many excellencies, that feed Your pride, turne to a plurify, and kill That which should nourish vertue; dare you think All blessings are conferd on you alone. Ya're grosly cousend; there's no good in you, Which others have not: are you a Scholler? so Are many, and as knowing: are you valiant? Waste not that courage then in braules, but spend it In the warres, in service of your King and Countrey. Duarte. Yes, so I might be generall, no man lives, That's worthy to command me Man. Sir, in Lisborne I am: and you shall know it; every hower I am troubled with complaints of your behaviour From men of all conditions, and all sexes. And my authority, which you presume Will beare you out, in that you are my Nephew, No longer shall protect you, for I vowe Though all that's past I pardon, I will punish The next fault with as much severity As if you were a stranger, rest assur'd on't. Guio. And by that love you should beare, or that duty You owe a Mother, once more I command you To cast this hautinesse off; which if you doe, All that is mine, is yours, if not, expect My prayers, and vowes, for your conversion onely, But never meanes nor favour. Exit. Manuell and Guiomar. Dua. I am tutord As I if I were a child still, the base peasants That feare, and envy my great worth, have done this; But I will finde them out, I will aboord Yet my disguise, I have too long been idle Nor will I curbe my spirit, I was born free, And will pursue the course best liketh me. Exeunt. Enter Leopold, Sailors, and Zenocia. Leop. Devide the spoile amongst you, this fair captive I only challenge for my selfe. Sail. You have wonne her And well deserve her: twenty yeares I have liv'd A Burgesse of the Sea, and have been present At many a desperate fight, but never saw So small a barque with such incredible valour So long defended, and against such odds, And by two men scarce arm'd too. Leop. 'Twas a wonder. And yet the courage they exprest being taken And the contempt of death wan more upon me Then all they did, when they were free: me-thinkes I see them yet when they were brought aboord us, Disarm'd and ready to be put in fetters How on the suddain, as if they had sworn, Never to taste the bread of servitude, Both snatching up their swords, and from this Virgin, Taking a farewell only with their eyes, They leapt into the Sea. Sail. Indeed 'twas rare. Leop. It wrought so much on me, that but I feard, The great ship that pursued us, our own safety Hindring my charitable purpose to 'em, I would have took 'em up, and with their lives They should have had their liberties. Zen. O too late For they are lost, for ever lost Leop. Take comfort 'Tis not impossible, but that they live yet, For when they left the ships they were within A league o'th shore, and with such strength and cunning They swimming, did delude the rising billows, With one hand making way, and with the other, Their bloudy swords advancst, threatning the Sea-gods With war, unlesse they brought them safely off, That I am almost confident they live And you again may see them. Zen. In that hope I brook a wretched being, till I am Made certaine of their fortunes, but they dead Death hath so many doores to let out life, I will not long survive them. Leop. Hope the best, And let the courteous usage you have found, Not usuall in men of Warre perswade you To tell me your condition. Zen. You know it, A Captive, my fate and your power have made me, Such I am now, but what I was it skills not: For they being dead, in whom I only live I dare not challenge family, or country And therefore Sir enquire not, let it suffice, I am your servant, and a thankfull servant, (If you will call that so, which is but duty) I ever will be, and my honour safe, Which nobly hitherto ye have preserv'd No slavery can appear in such a forme, Which with a masculine constancy, I will not Boldly looke on and suffer. Leop. You mistake me: That you are made my prisoner, may prove The birth of your good fortune. I doe finde A winning language in your tongue and looks; Nor can a suite by you mov'd be deni'd, And therefore of a prisoner you must be The Victors advocate Zen. To whom? Leop. A Lady. In whom all graces that can perfect beauty Are friendly met, I grant that you are faire: And had I not seen her before, perhaps I might have sought to you Zen. This I heare gladly, Leop. To this incomparable Lady I will give you, (Yet being mine, you are already hers) And to serve her is more then to be free, At least I think so: and when you live with her, If you will please to think on him that brought you To such a happinesse, for so her bountie Will make you think her seruice, you shall euer Make me at your devotion Zen. All I can doe, Rest you assur'd of. Leop. At night I'le present you, Till when I am your guard Zen. Ever your servant. Exeunt. Enter Arnoldo and Rutillio. Arn. To what are we reserv'd? Rut. Troth tis uncertaine, Drowning we have scap'd miraculously, and Stand faire for ought I know for hanging; money We have none, nor ere are like to have; 'tis To be doubted: besides we are strangers, Wondrous hungry strangers; and charity Growing cold, and miracles ceasing, Without a Conjurers help, cannot finde When we shall eate agen. Arn. These are no wants If put in ballance, with Zenocias losse; In that alone, all miseries are spoken: O my Rutillio, when I think on her, And that which she may suffer, being a captive, Then I could curse my selfe, almost those powers That send me from the fury of the Ocean. Rut. You have lost a wife indeed, a faire and chast one, Two blessings, not found often in one woman; But she may be recovered, questionlesse The ship that took us was of Portugall And he in Lisbon, by some meanes or other We may heare of her. Arn. In that hope I live. Rut. And so do I, but hope is a poor sallad To dine and sup with, after a two dayes fast too, Have you no money left? Arn. Not a Denier, Rut. Nor any thing to pawn? 'tis now in fashion, Having a Mistris, sure you should not be Without a neate historicall shirt. Arn. For shame Talke not so poorly. I must talke of that Necessity prompts us to, for beg I cannot, Nor am I made to creep in at a window, To filch to feed me, something must be done, And suddenly resolve on't. Enter Zabulon and a servant. Arn. What are these? Rut. One by his habite is a Jew Zab. No more: Thou art sure that's he. Ser. Most certaine. Zab. How long is it Since first she saw him? Ser. Some two hours. Exit Ser. Zab. Be gone—let me alone to work him. Rut. How he eyes you, Now he moves, towards us, in the Devills name What would he with us? Arn. Innocence is bold: Nor can I feare Zab. That you are poore and strangers, I easily perceive Rut. But that you'le help us, Or any of your tribe, we dare not hope Sir. Zab. Why think you so? Rut. Because you are a Jew Sir, And courtesies come sooner from the Devill Then any of your Nation. Zab. We are men, And have like you, compassion when we finde Fit subjects for our bounty, and for proofe That we dare give, and freely, not to you Sir, Pray spare your paines, there's gold, stand not amaz'd, 'Tis current I assure you Rut. Take it man. Sure thy good Angel is a Jew, and comes Tapers ready. In his own shape to help thee: I could wish now, Mine would appeare so, like a Turke. Arn. I thank you, But yet must tell you, if this be the prologue To any bad act, you would have me practice I must not take it. Zab. This is but the earnest Of that which is to follow, and the bond Which you must seale to for't, is your advancement, Fortune with all that's in her power to give, Offers her selfe up to you; entertaine her, And that which Princes have kneel'd for in vaine Presents it selfe to you. Arn. 'Tis above wonder Rut. But far beneath the truth, in my relation Of what you shall possesse, if you embrace it. There is an hour in each mans life appointed To make his happinesse if then he seize it, And this, (in which, beyond all expectation, You are invited to your good) is yours, If you dare follow me, so, if not, hereafter Expect not the like offer. Exit. Arn. 'Tis no vision. Rut. 'Tis gold I'm sure. We must like brothers share, There's for you; by this light I'me glad I have it. There are few gallants, (for men may be such And yet want gold, yea and sometimes silver,) But would receive such favours from the Divel, Though he appeared like a broker, and demanded Sixty ith' hundred. Arn. Wherefore should I feare, Some plot upon my life? 'tis now to me Not worth the keeping. I will follow him, Farewell, wish me good fortune, we shall meete Againe I doubt not. Rut. Or I'le ne're trust Jew more. Exit Arnoldo. Nor Christian for his sake—plague o' my stars, How long might I have walkt without a cloake, Before I should have met with such a fortune? We elder Brothers, though we are proper men, Ha not the luck. Ha' too much beard, that spoiles us; The smooth chin carries all? whats here to do now? Manet Rutillio. Enter Duart, Alonso, and a Page. Dua. I'le take you as I finde you: Alon. That were base—you see I am unarm'd. Dua. Out with your bodkin Your pocket dagger, your steletto, out with it, Or by this hand i'le kill you: such as you are Have studied the undoing of poore Cutlers, And made all manly weapons out of fashion: You carry Poniards to murder men, Yet dare not wear a sword to guard your Honour. Rut. that's true indeed: upon my life this gallant Is brib'd to repeale banisht swords. Dua. I'le shew you The difference now, between a Spanish rapier And your pure pisa. Alon. Let me fetch a sword, Upon mine honour I'le returne. Dua. Not so Sir. Alon. Or lend me yours I pray you, and take this. Rut. To be disgrac'd as you are, no I thank you Spight of the fashion, while I live, I am Lights ready. Instructed to goe arm'd: what folly 'tis For you that are a man, to put your selfe Into your enemies mercie. Dua. Yield it quickly Or I'le cut off your hand, and now disgrace you, Thus kicke and baffle you: as you like this You may again prefer complaints against me To my Uncle and my Mother, and then think To make it good with a poniard. Alon. I am paid For being of the fashion. Dua. Get a sword, Then if you dare, redeeme your reputation: You know I am easily found: Ile adde this to it To put you in mind. Rut. You are too insolent, And do insult too much on the advantage, Of that which your unequall weapon gave you, More then your valour. Dua. This to me you peasant? Thou art not worthy of my foote poore fellow, Tis scorne, not pitty, makes me give thee life: Kneele down and thank me for't: how, do you stare? Rut. I have a sword Sir, you shall find, a good one; This is no stabbing guard. Dua. Wert thou thrice arm'd, Thus yet I durst attempt thee. Rut. Then have at you, I scorne to take blows. Dua. O I am slaine. Page. Help! murther, murther! Alon. Shift for your selfe you are dead else, You have kill'd the Governours Nephew. Page. Raise the streetes there. Alon. If once you are beset you cannot scape, Will you betray your selfe? Rut. Undone for ever. Exit Rut. &amp; Alonzo. Enter Officers. Off. Who makes this out-cry, Page. O my Lord is murdered; This way he tooke, make after him, Help help there. Exit Page. 2. Off. 'Tis Don Duart. 1. Off. Pride has got a fall He was still in quarrels, scorn'd us Peace-makers, And all our bill-authority, now ha's paid for't. You ha' met with your match Sir now, bring off his body And beare it to the Governour. Some pursue The murderer; yet if he scape, it skills not; Were I a Prince, I would reward him for't, He ha's ridde the City of a turbulent beast, There's few will pitty him: but for his Mother I truly grieve indeed, shee's a good Lady. Exeunt. Enter Guiomar and Servants. Guio. Hee's not i'th house, Ser. No madam: Guio. Haste and seek him, Goe all and every where, I'le not to bed Till you returne him, take away the lights too, The Moone lends me too much, to finde my feares, And those devotions I am to pay Are written in my heart, not in this booke, Kneele. And I shall reade them there without a taper, Exit Serv. Enter Rutillio. Rut. I am pursued; all the Ports are stopt too; Not any hope to escape, behind, before me, On either side I am beset, cursed fortune My enemie on the Sea, and on the Land too, Redeem'd from one affliction to another: Would I had made the greedy waves my tombe And dyed obscure, and innocent, not as Neroe Smear'd ore with blood. Whither have my fears brought me? I am got into a house, the doors all open, This, by the largenesse of the roome, the hangings, And other rich adornments, glistring through The sable masque of night, sayes it belongs To one of meanes and ranke: no servant stirring? Murmur nor whisper? Guio. Who's that? Rut. By the voice, This is a woman. Guio. Stephano, Jaspe, Julia, Who waites there? Rut. 'Tis the Lady of the house I'le flie to her protection. Guio. Speak, what are you? Rut. Of all that ever breath'd, a man most wretched. Guio. I am sure you are a man of most ill manners, You could not with so little reverence else Presse to my private chamber. Whither would you, Or what do you seeke for? Rut. Gracious woman heare me; I am a stranger, and in that I answer All your demands, a most unfortunate stranger, That cald unto it by my enemies pride, Have left him dead it'h streets, Justice pursues me, And for that life, I tooke unwillingly, And in a faire defence, I must lose mine, Unlesse you in your charity protect me. Your house is now my sanctuary, and the Altar, I gladly would take hold of your sweet mercy. By all that's deare unto you, by your vertues, And by your innocence, that needs no forgivenesse Take pitty on me. Guio. Are you a Castillian: Rut. No Madam, Italy claims my birth. Guio. I ask not With purpose to betray you, if you were Ten thousand times a Spaniard, the nation We Portugals most hate, I yet would save you If it lay in my power: lift up these hangings; Behind my Beds head theres a hollow place, Into which enter; so, but from this stir not If the Officers come, as you expect they will doe, I know they owe such reverence to my lodgings That they will easily give credit to me And search no further. Rut. The blest Saints pay for me The infinite debt I owe you. Guio. How he quakes? Thus far I feele his heart beate, be of comfort, Once more I give my promise for your safety, All men are subject to such accidents, Especially the valiant; and who knows not, But that the charity I afford this stranger My only Son else-where may stand in neede of? Enter Officers and servants with the body of Duart—Page. 1 Ser. Now Madam, if your wisedome ever could Raise up defences against floods of sorrow That hast to overwhelme you, make true use of Your great discretion. 2 Ser. Your only sonne My Lord Duart's slaine. 1 Off. His murtherer, pursued by us Was by a boy discovered Entring your house, and that induced us To presse into it for his apprhension. Guio. Oh? 1 Ser. Sure her heart is broke. Off. Madam. Guio. Stand off, My sorrow is so deare and pretious to me, That you must not partake it, suffer it Hold a purse ready. Like wounds that do breed inward to dispatch me. O my Duart, such an end as this Thy pride long since did prophesie; thou art dead, And to encrease my misery, thy sad mother? Must make a wilfull shipwrack of her vow Or thou fall unreveng'd. My soule's divided And piety to a son, and true performance Of hospitable duties to my guest, That are to others Angels, are my furies. Vengeance knocks at my heart, but my word given Denies the entrance, is no medium left, But that I must protect the murderer Or suffer in that faith he made his Altar? Motherly love give place, the fault made this way, To keep a vow, to which high heaven is witnesse, Heaven may be pleas'd to pardon. Enter Manuel, Doctors, Surgeons. Man. 'Tis too late Hee's gone, past all recovery: now reproofe Were but unseasonable when I should give comfort, And yet remember Sister. Guio. O forbeare, Search for the murtherer, and remove the body, And as you thinke fit, give it buriall. Wretch that I am, uncapable of all comfort, And therefore I intreate my friends and kinsfolk, And you my Lord, for some spare to forbeare Your courteous visitations. Man. We obey you. Exeunt omnes with the body. Manet Guiomar. Rut. My spirits come back, and now despaire resignes Her place againe to hope. Guio. What ere thou art To whom I have given meanes of life, to witnesse With what religion I have kept my promise, Come fearlesse forth, but let thy face be cover'd, That I hereafter be not forct to know thee, For motherly affection may returne My vow once paid to heaven. Thou hast taken from me, The respiration of my heart, the light Of my swoln eyes, in his life that sustain'd me: Yet my word given to save you, I make good, Because what you did, was not done with malice, You are not knowne, there is no marke about you That can discover you; let not feare betray you. With all convenient speed you can, flie from me That I may never see you; and that want Of meanes may be no let unto your journie, There are a hundred Crownes: you are at the doore now, And so farewell for ever. Rut. Let me first fall Before your feete, and on them pay the duty I owe your goodnesse; next all blessings to you, And heaven restore the joyes I have bereft you, With full increase hereafter, living be The Goddesse stil'd of Hospitalitie.</field>

Fling off these sullen cloudes, you are enterd now Into a house of joy and hapinesse, I have prepar'd a blessing for ye. Zen. Thanke ye Leo. You are peevish And know not wh? ye are freinded, I have us'd those means My state would rather aske a curse,. The Lady of this house, the noble Lady, Will take ye as her owne, and use ye graciously: Make much of what you are, Mistris of that beautie, And expose it not to such betraying sorrowes: When ye are old, and all those sweets hang witherd, Enter Servant. Then sit and sight Zen. My Autum is not farr off, Leo. Have you told your Lady Ser. Yes Sir, I have told her Both of your noble service, and your present, Which she accepts, Leo. I should be blest to see her. Ser. That now you cannot doe: she keeps her Chamber Not well dispos'd; and has denied all visits, The maid I have in charge to receive from ye, So please you render her. Leo. With all my service, But faine I would have seene, Ser. 'Tis but your patience; No doubt she cannot but remember nobely. Leo. These three yeares I have lov'd this scornfull Lady, And followed her with all the truth of service, In all which time, but twice she has honoured me With sight of her blest beauty: when you please Sir, You may receive your charge, and tell your Lady; A Gentleman whose life is onely dedicated, To her commands, kisses her beauteous hands; And Faire-one, now your helpe, you may remember The honest courtesies, since you are mine I ever did your modesty: you shall be neare her, And if sometimes you name my service to her And tell her with what noblenesse I love her, 'Twill be a gratitude I shall remember. Zen. What in my poore power lyes, so it be honest. Leo. I aske no more. Ser. You must along with me (Faire) Leo. And so I leave you two: but to a fortune Too happy for my fate: you shall enjoy her. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Zabulon and Servants. Zab. Be quick, be quick, Out with the bucket there, These sents are dull; cast richer on, and fuller; Sente every place, where have you plas'd the musicke? Ser. Here they stand ready Sir. Zab. 'Tis well, be sure The wines be lusty, high, and full of spirit, And Amberd all. Ser. They are Zab. Give faire attendance. In the best trim, and state, make ready all. (Banquet set forth I shall come presently againe. Exit. 2. Ser. We shall Sir, What preperation's this? Some new devise My Lady has in hand, 1. Ser. ô, prosper it As long as it carries good wine in the mouth? And good meate with it, where are all the rest 2. Ser. They are ready to attend. Ser. Sure some great person, Musicke They would not make this hurry else. 2. Ser. Harke the Musicke. Enter Zabulon and Arnoldo. It will appeare now certaine, here it comes. Now to our places. Ar. Whether will he lead me? What invitations this? to what new end, Are these faire preperations? a rich Banquet, Musicke, and every place stuck with adornment, Fit for a Princes welcome; what new game Has Fortune now prepared to shew me happle? And then againe to sink me? 'tis no illusion. Mine eyes are not deceiv'd, all these are reall; What wealth and State? Zab. Will you sit downe and eate Sir? These carry little wonder, they are usuall; But you shall see, if you be wise to observe it, That that will strike indeed: strike with amazement, Then if you be a man: this faire health to you. Ar. What shall I see? I pledge ye Sir, I was never So buried in amazement— Zab. You are so still Drinke freely. Ar. The very wines are admirable: Good Sir, give me leave to aske this question, For what great worthy man, are these prepard? And why do you bring me hither? Zab. They are for you, Sir; And under-vallve not the worth you carry, You are that worthy man: thinke well of these. They shall be more, and greater. Ar. Well, blinde fortune Thou hast the prettiest changes when thou art pleas'd, To play thy game out wantonly— Zab. Come be lusty And awake your Spirits. Cease Musick Ar. Good Sir, do not wake me. For willingly I would dye in this dreame, pray whose Servants Are all these that attend her? Zab. They are yours; They wait on you, Ar. I never yet remember I kept such faces, nor that I was ever able To maintaine so many. Zab. Now you are, and shall be, Ar. You'l say this house is mine too? Zab. Say it? sweare it. Ar. And all this wealth? Zab. This is the least you see Sir. Ar. Why, where has this been hid these thirtie yeares? For certainely I never found I was wealthie Till this hower, never dream'd of house, and Servants, I had thought I had been a younger brother, a poore Gent. I may eat boldly then. Zab. 'Tis prepared for ye. Ar. The taste is perfect, and most delicate: But why for me? give me some wine, I do drink; I feele it sensibly, and I am here, Here in this glorious place: I am bravely used too, Good Gentle Sir, give me leave to thinke a little For either I am much abus'd— Zab. Strike Musick And sing that lusty Song. Musick Song. Ar. Bewitching harmony! Sure I am turn'd into another Creature. Enter Hyppolita. Happy and blest, Arnoldo was unfortunate; Ha? blesse mine eyes; what pretious piece of nature To poze the world? Zab. I told you, you would see that, Would darken these poore preparations; What think ye now? nay rise not, 'tis no vision. Ar. Tis more: 'tis miracle. Hyp. You are welcome Sir. Ar. It speakes, and entertaines me still more glorious; She is warme, and this is flesh here: how she stirrs me. Blesse me what stars are there? Hyp. May I sit neere ye? Ar. No, you are too pure an object to behold, Too excellent to looke upon, and live; I must remove. Zab. She is a woman Sir, Fy, what faint hart is this Ar. The house of wonder. Zab. Do not you thinke your selfe now truely happie? You have the abstract of all sweetnesse by ye, The pretious wealth youth Labors to arrive at Nor is she lesse in honour, then in beauty, Ferraras, roiall Duke, is proud to call her His best, his noblest, and most happie Sister, Fortune has made her Mistris of herselfe, Wealthy, and wise, without a power to sway her, Wonder of Italy, of all harts Mistris. Arn. And all this is— Zab. Hyppolita the beauteous. Hyp. You are a poore relator of my fortunes, Too weake a Chronicle to speak my blessings, And leave out that essentiall part of Story I am most high and happy in, most fortunate, The acquaintance, and the noble fellowship Of this faire Gentleman: pray ye do not wonder, Nor hold it strange to heare a handsome Lady Speak freely to ye: with your fair leave &amp; courtesie I will sit by ye. Arn. I know not what to answer, Nor where I am, nor to what end consider, Why do you use me thus? Hyp. are ye angry Sir, Because ye are entertain'd with all humanity? Freely and nobly us'd? Arn. No gentle Lady That were uncivill, but it much amazes me A stranger, and a man of no desert Should finde such floods of courtesie. Hyp. I love ye, I honour ye, the first and best of all men, And where that faire opinion leads, 'tis usuall These trifles that but serve to set off, follow, I would not have you proud now, nor disdainful Because I say I love ye, though I sweare it, Nor thinke it a stale favour I fling on ye, Though ye be handsome, and the only man I must confesse I ever fixt mine eye on, And bring along all promises that please us, Yet I should hate ye then, despise ye, scorne ye, And with as much contempt pursue your person, As now I doe with love. But you are wiser, At least I think, more master of your fortune, And so I drink your health. Arn. Hold fast good honesty, I am a lost man else. Hyp. Now you may kisse me, 'Tis the first kisse, I ever aske, I sweare to ye. Arn. That I dare doe sweet Lady. Hyp. You doe it well too; You are a Master Sir, that makes you coy. Arn. Would you would send your people off. Hyp. Well thought on. Wait all without. Exit. Zab. and servants Zab. I hope she is pleas'd throughly. Hyp. Why stand ye still? her'es no man to detect ye, My people are gon off: come, come, leave conjuring The Spirit you would raise, is here already Looke boldly on me. Ar. What would you have me doe? Hyp. O most unmanly question! have you do? Is't possible your yeares should want a Tutor? I'le teach ye: come, embrace me. Ar. Fy stand off; And give me leave, more now, then ere, to wonder, A building of so goodly a proportion, Outwardly all exact, the frame of Heaven, Should hide within so base Inhabitants? You are as faire, as if the morning bare ye, Imagination never made a sweeter; Can it be possible this frame should suffer, And built on slight affections, fright the vewer? Be excellent in all, as you are outward, The worthy Mistris of those many blessings Heaven has bestowed, make 'em appeare still nobler, Because they are trusted to a weaker keeper. Would ye have me love ye? Hyp. Yes, Ar. Not for your beautie; Though I confesse, it blowes the first fire in us, Time as he passes by, puts out that sparkle, Nor for your wealth, although the world kneele to it, And make it all addition to a woman, Fortune that ruines all, makes that his conquest; Be honest, and be vertuous, i'le admire ye, At least be wise, and where ye lay these nets, Strow over 'em a little modesty, 'Twill well become your cause, and catch more Fooles. Hyp. Could any one that lov'd this wholsome counsell But love the giver more? you make me fonder: You have a vertuous minde, I want that ornament; Is it a sin I covet to enjoy ye? If ye imagine I am too free a Lover, And act that part belongs to you I am silent; Mine eyes shall speake my blushes, parly with ye, I will not touch your hand, but with a tremble Fitting a vestall Nun; not long to kisse ye, But gently as the aire, and undiscerned too, I'le steale it thus: I'le walke your shadow by ye, So still and silent that it shall be equall, To put me off, as that, and when I covet, To give such toyes as these— Ar. A new temptation— Hyp. Thus like the lazie minuts will drop 'em, Which past once are forgotten. Ar. Excellent vice! Hyp. Will ye be won? looke stedfastly upon me, Looke manly, take a mans affections to you; Young women, in the old world were not wont, Sir, To hang out gaudy busshes for their beauties, To talke themselues into young-mens affections; How cold and dull you are? Ar. How I stagger? She is wise, as faire; but 'tis a wicked wisedome; I'le choacke before I yield. Zabulon within. Hyp. who waites within there Make ready the greene chamber, Zab. It shall be Madam. Ar. I am afraid she will injoy me indeed, Hyp. What Musicke do ye love? Ar. A modest tongue. Hyp. Wee'll have enough of that: fy, fy, how lumpish? In a young Ladies armes, thus dull? Ar. For heaven sake Profess a little goodnesse. Hyp. Of what Countrey? Ar. I am of Rome. Hyp. Nay then I know you mock me, The Italians are not frighted with such bug-bears, Prethee go in. Ar. I am not well; Hyp. I'le make thee, I'le kisse thee well: Ar. I am not sicke of that sore. Hyp. upon my conscience, I must ravish thee, I shall be famous for the first example: With this I'le tye ye first, then trye your strength Sir, Ar. My strength, away base woman? I abhor thee. I am not caught with stales, disease dwell with thee. Exit. Hyp. Are ye so quicke? and have I lost my wishes? Hoe, Zabulon; my Seruants. Enter Zabulon and Servants. Call'd ye Madam? Hyp. Is all that beautie scorned, so many sude for? So many Princes? by a stranger too? Must I endure this? Zab. Wher's the Gentleman? Hyp. Go presently, pursue the stranger, Zabulon. He has broke from me, Jewels I have given him: Charge him with theft: hee has stolne my love, my freedome, Draw him before the Governour, imprison him, Why dost thou stay? Zab. I'le teach him a new daunce, For playing fast and loose with such a Lady. Come fellowes, come: I'le execute your anger, And to the full. Hyp. His scorne shall feele my vengeance.— Exeunt. Scæna Tertia. Enter Sulpicia and Jaques. Sul. Shall I never see a lusty man againe? Ja. Faith Mistris You do so over-labour 'em when you have 'em, And so dry-founder 'em, they cannot last. Sul. Wher's the French-man? Alas, he's all to fitters, And lyes, taking the height of his fortune with a Sirreng. Hee's chin'd, he's chin'd good man, he is a mourner. Sul. What's become of the Dane? Ja. Who? goldy-locks? Hee's foule i'th touch-hole; and recoiles againe, The main Spring's weakned that holds up his cock, He lies at the signe of the Sun, to be new breech'd. Sul. The Rutter too, is gone. Ja. O that was a brave rascall, He would labour like a thresher: but alas What thing can ever last? he has been ill mewd, And drawne too soon; I have seene him in the Hospitall. Sul. There was an English-man. Ja. I there was an English-man; You'le scant finde any now, to make that name good. There was those English that were men indeed, And would performe like men, but now they are vanisht: They are so taken up in their own Countrey, And so beaten off their speed, by their own women, When they come here, they draw their legs like hackneys: Drinke, and their owne devices has undone 'em. Sul. I must have one that's strong, no life in Lisbon else, Perfect and young: my custome with young Ladies, And high-fed Citie dames, will fall, and breake else. I want my selfe too, in mine age to nourish me: They are are all sunk I maintain'd: now what's this businesse. What goodly fellow's that? Enter Rutillio and Officers Rut. Why do you drag me? Pox ô your Justice; let me loose. 1 Off. Not so Sir. Rut. Cannot a man fall into one of your drunken Cellers, And ventur the breaking on's neck, your trap-dores open But he must be us'd thus rascally? 1 Off. What made you wandring So late i'th night? you know that is imprisonment. Rut. May be I walke in my sleep. 2 Off. May be wee'l walk ye. What made ye wandring Sir, into that vault Where all the Citie store, and the Munition lay? Rut. I fell into't by chance, I broke my shins for't. Your Worships feele not that: I knockt my head Against a hundred posts, would you had had it. Cannot I breake my necke in mine own defence? 2 Off. This will not serve: you cannot put it off so, Your comming thither was to play the villaine, To fire the powder, to blow that part oth' City. Rut. Yes, with my nose why were the trap-doors open? Might not you fall, or you? had you gone that way? I thought your Citie had sunke. 1 Off. You did your best Sir, We must presume to help it into'th aire. If you call that sinking: we have told you what's the law, He that is taken there, unlesse a Magistrate, And have command in that place, presently If there be nothing found apparent, neare him Worthie his torture, or his present death, Must either pay his fine for his presumption, (Which is sixe hundred Duckets) or for six yeares Tug at an Oare i'th Gallies: will ye walke Sir, For we presume you cannot pay the penalty. Rut. Row in the Gallies, after all this mischief? 2 Off. May be you were drunke, they'le keepe you sober there. Rut. Tug at an Oare? you are not arrant rascals, To catch me in a pit-fall, and betray me, Sul. A lusty minded man. Ja. A wondrous able. Sul. Pray Gentlemen, allow me but that liberty To speake a few words with your prisoner And I shall thanke you. 1 Off. Take your pleasure, Lady. Sul. What would you give that woman should redeem ye, Redeem ye from this slavery? Rut. Besides my service I would give her my whole selfe, I would be her vassall. Sul. Shee has reason to expect as much, considering The great summe she payes for't, yet take comfort What ye shall doe to merit this, is easie And I will be the woman shall befriend ye, 'Tis but to entertaine some handsome Ladies, And young faire Gentlewomen: you ghesse the way: But giving of your mind— Rut. I am excellent at it: You cannot picke out such another living. I understand ye: is't not thus? Sul. Ye have it. Rut. Bring me a hundred of em: I'le dispatch 'em, I will be none but yours: should another offer Another way to redeem me, I should scorne it. What women you shall please: I am monstrous lusty: Not to be taken downe: would you have Children? I'le get you those as fast, and thicke as flie-blows. Sul. I admire him: wonder at him. Rut. Harke ye Lady, You may require sometimes— Sul. I by my faith. Rut. And you shall have it by my faith, &amp; handsomly: This old Cat wil suck shrewdly: you have no daughters? I flye at all: now am I in my Kingdome, Tug at an Oare? no, tug in a feather-bed, With good warme Caudles; hang your bread and water, I'le make you young againe, beleeve that Lady. I will so frubbish you. Sul. Come, follow Officers, This Gentleman is free: I'le pay the Duckets. Rut. And when you catch me in your City-powdring-tub Againe, boile me with Cabbidge. 1 Off. You are both warn'd and arm'd Sir. Exeunt. Scæna quarta. Enter Leopold, Hypolita, Zenocia. Zen. Will your Ladiship weare this dressing? Hyp. Leave thy prating: I care not what I weare. Zen. Yet 'tis my duty To know your pleasure, and my worst affection To see you discontented. Hyp. Weeping too? Prethee forgive me: I am much distemperd, And speake I know not what: to make thee amends The gowne that I wore yesterday, is thine; Let it alone a while. Leo. Now you perceive, And taste her bounty. Zen. Much above my merit. Leo. But have you not yet found a happy time To move for me. Zen. I have watched all occasions, But hitherto, without successe: yet doubt not But I'le embrace the first meanes. Leo. Do, and prosper; Excellent creature, whose perfections make Even sorrow lovely, if your frowns thus take me What would your smiles doe? Hyp. Pox ô this stale Courtship: If I have any power. Leo. I am commanded, Obedience is the Lovers sacrifice Which I pay gladly. Hyp. To be forc'd to wooe, Being a woman, could not but torment me, But bringing for my Advocates, youth and beauty, Set off with wealth: and then to be deni'd too Do's comprehend all tortures. They flatterd me, That said my lookes were charmes, my touches fetters, My locks soft chaines, to binde the armes of Princes, And make them in that wish'd for bondage, happy, I am like others of a courser feature, As weake to allure, but in my dotage, stronger: I am no Circe; he, more then Ulysses, Scornes all my offerd bounties, slights my favours, And, as I were some new Egyptian, flyes me, Leaving no pawne, but my own shame behind him, But he shall finde, that in my fell revenge, I am a woman: one that never pardons The rude contemner of her profferd sweetnesse. Enter Zabulon. Zab. Madam, 'tis done; Hyp. What's done? Zab. The uncivill stranger Is at your suite arrested. Hyp. 'Tis well handled. Zab. And under guard sent to the Governour, With whom my testimony, and the favour, He beares your Ladiship, have so prevail'd That he is sentenc'd. Hyp. How? Zab. To loose his head. Hyp. Is that the meanes to quench the scorching heate Of my inrag'd desires? must innocence suffer, 'Cause I am faulty? or is my Love so fatall That of necessity it must destroy The object it most longs for? dull Hypollita, To thinke that injuries could make way for love, When courtesies were despis'd: that by his death Thou shouldst give that, which only thou canst hope for While he is living: My honours at the stake now, And cannot be preserv'd, unlesse he perish The enjoying of the thing I love, I ever Have priz'd above my fame: why doubt I now then? One only way is left me, to redeeme all: Make ready my Caroch. Leo. What will you Madam. Hyp. And yet I am impatient of such stay: Bind up my haire: fy, fy, while that is doing The Law may cease his life: thus, as I am then, Not like Hypollita, but a Baebanall My frantique Love transports me. Exit. Leo. Sure shee's distracted. Zab. Pray you follow her: I will along with you: I more then ghesse the cause: women that love Are most uncertaine, and one minute crave, What, in another they refuse to have. Exit. Scæna 5a. Enter Clodio, Charino. Clo. Assure thy selfe Charino, I am alter'd From what I was; the tempests we have met with In our uncertaine voyage, were smooth gales Compar'd to those, the memory of my lusts Rais'd in my conscience: and if ere againe I live to see Zenocia, I will sue, And seek to her as a Lover, and a Servant, And not command affection, like a Tyrant. Char. In hearing this; you make me young againe, And heaven, it seemes, favouring this good change in you In setting of a period to our dangers Gives us faire hopes, to find that here in Lisbon Which hitherto in vain we long have sought for. I have receiv'd assur'd intelligence; Such strangers have bin seen here: and though yet I cannot learn their fortunes, nor the place Of their abode, I have a soule presages A fortunate event here. Clo. There have pass'd A mutuall enterchange of courtesies Between me, and the Governour; therfore boldly We may presume of him, and of his power If we finde cause to use them, otherwise I Would not be known here, and these disguises Will keep us from discovery. Enter Manuel, Doctor, Arnoldo, Guard. Char. What are these? Clo. The Governour: with him my Rivall, bound. Char. For certaine 'tis Arnoldo. Clo. Let's attend What the successe will be. Man. Is't possible There should be hope of his recovery, His wounds so many and so deadly? Doct. So they appear'd at first, but the blood stop'd, His trance forsook him, and on better search We found they were not mortall; Man. Use all care To perfect this unhop'd for cure: that done Propose your own rewards; and till you shall Heare farther from me, for some ends I have, Conceal'd it from his Mother. Doct. Wee'l not faile Sir. Exit. Man. You stil stand confident on your innocence. Arn. It is my best and last guard, which I will not Leave, to relye on your uncertaine mercy. Enter Hypolita, Zabulon, Leopold, Zenocia, 2 Servants. Hyp. Who bade you follow me! Goe home, &amp; you Sir, As you respect me, goe with her. Arn. Zenocia? And in her house a Servant? Cha. 'Tis my daughter. Clo. My love? Contain your joy, observe the sequel. Zen. passes Man. Fye Madam, how undecent 'tis for you. So far, unlike your selfe to bee seene thus In th'open streets? why do you kneele? pray you rise, I am acquainted with the wrong, and losse You have sustain'd, and the Delinquent now Stands ready for his punishment. Hyp. Let it fall Sir, On the offender: he is innocent And most unworthy of these bonds he weares, But I made up of guilt. Man. VVhat strange turne's this? Leo. This was my prisoner once. Hyp. If chastity In a young man, and tempted to the height too Did ere deserve reward, or admiration, He justly may claim both. Love to his person (Or if you please give it a fowler name) Compel'd me first to train him to my house, All engines I rais'd there to shake his vertue, Which in the assault were uselesse; he unmov'd stil As if he had no part of humane frailty, Against the nature of my Sex, almost I plaid the Ravisher. You might have seen In our contention, young Apollo fly And love-sicke Daphne follow, all arts failing, By flight he wan the victory, breaking from My scorn'd embraces: the repulse (in women Unsufferable) invited me to practise A meanes to be reveng'd: and from this grew His Accusation, and the abuse Of your still equall justice: My rage ever Thanks heaven, though wanton, I found not my selfe So far engag'd to hell, to prosecute To the death what I had plotted, for that love That made me first desire him, then accuse him, Commands me with the hazard of my selfe First to entreate his pardon, then acquit him. Man. What ere you are, so much I love your vertue That I desire your friendship: doe you unloose him From those bonds, you are worthy of, your repentance Makes part of satisfaction; yet I must Severely reprehend you. Leo. I am made A stale on all parts: But this fellow shall Pay dearely for her favour. Arn. My life's so full Of various changes, that I now despaire Of any certaine port; one trouble ending, A new, and worse succeeds it: what should Zenocia Doe in this womans house? Can chastity And hot Lust dwell together without infection? I would not be or jealous, or secure, Yet something must be done, to sound the depth on't: That she lives is my blisse, but living there, A hell of torments; there's no way to her In whom I live, but by this door, through which To me, 'tis death to enter, yet I must, And will make tryall. Man. Let me hear no more Of these devices, Lady: this I pardon, And at your intercession I forgive Your instrument the Jew too: get you home. The hundred thousand crowns you lent the City Towards the setting forth of the last Navy Bound for the islands, was a good then, which I ballance with your ill now. Char. Now Sir, to him, You know my daughter needs it. Hyp. Let me take A farewell with mine ey, Sir, though my lip, Be barr'd the Ceremonie, courtesie And custome too allowes of. Arn. Gentle Madam, I neither am so cold, nor so ill bred But that I dare receive it: you are unguarded, And let me tell you that I am asham'd Of my late rudeness, and would gladly therefore If you please to accept my ready service Waite on you to your house. Hyp. Above my hope: Sir, if an Angel were to be my convoy He should not be more welcome.— Exit Arn. and Hyp. Clo. Now you know me. Man. Yes Sir, and honour you: ever remembring Your many bounties, being ambitious only To give you cause to say by some one service That I am not ungratefull. Clo. 'Tis now offer'd: I have a suite to you, and an easie one, Which e're long you shall know. Man. When you think fit Sir, And then as a command; I will receive it, Till when, most welcome: you are welcome too Sir, 'Tis spoken from the heart, and therefore needs not Much protestation: at your better leysure I will enquire the cause that brought you hither: In the meane time serve you. Clo. You out-doe me Sir. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quartus. Scæna Prima. Enter Duarte, Doctor. Duart. You have bestowed on me a second life For which I live your creature, and have better'd What nature fram'd unperfect, my first being Insolent pride made monstrous; but this later In learning me to know my selfe, hath taught me Not to wrong others. Doct. Then we live indeed. When we can goe to rest without a larum Given every minute to a guilt-sick conscience To keep us waking, and rise in the morning Secure in being innocent: but when In the remembrance of our worser actions We ever beare about us whips and furies, To make the day a night of sorrow to us, Even life's a burthen. Dua. I have found and felt it; But will endeavour having first made peace With those intestine enemies my rude passions To be so with man-kinde: but worthy Doctor, Pray if you can resolve me; was the Gentleman That left me dead, ere brought unto his tryall? Doct. Nor known, nor apprehended. Dua. Thats my griefe. Doct. Why doe you wish he had been punished? Dua. No, The streame of my swoln sorrow runs not that way: For could I finde him, as I vow to heaven It shall be my first care to seek him out, I would with thankes acknowledge that his sword, In opening my veines, which proud bloud poison'd, Gave the first symptomes of true health. Doct. 'Tis in you A Christian resolution: that you live Is by the Governours, your Uncles charge As yet conceal'd. And though a sons losse never Was solemniz'd with more teares of true sorrow Then have been paid by your unequald Mother For your supposed death, shee's not acquainted With your recovery. Dua. For some few dayes Pray let her so continue: thus disguis'd I may abroad unknown. Doct. Without suspition Of being discovered. Dua. I am confident No moisture sooner dies then womens teares, And therefore though I know my Mother vertuous, Yet being one of that fraile sex I purpose Her farther tryall. Doct. That as you thinke fit—I'le not betray you Dua. To finde out this stranger This true Phisician of my mind and manners Were such a blessing. He seem'd poore, and may Perhaps be now in want; would I could finde him. The Innes I'le search first, then the publique Stewes He was of Italy, and that Countrey breeds not Precisians that way, but hot Libertines; And such the most are: 'tis but a little travaile: I am unfurnisht too, pray Mr. Doctor, Can you supply me? Doct. With what summe you please. Dua. I will not be long absent. Doct. That I wish too; For till you have more strength, I would not have you To be too bold. Dua. Feare not, I will be carefull. Exeunt. Enter Leopold, Zabulon, Bravo. Zab. I have brought him Sir, a fellow that will do it Though Hell stood in his way, ever provided You pay him for't. Leop. He had a strange aspect And lookes much like the figure of a hang-man In a table of the Passion. Zab. He transcends, All presidents beleeve it, a flesh'd ruffian, That hath so often taken the Strappado, That 'tis to him, but as a lofty tricke Is to a tumbler: he hath perused too, All Dungeons in Portugall, thrice seven yeares Rowed in the Galleys for three severall murthers, Though I presume that he has done a hundred, And scapt unpunisht. Leop. He is much indebt to you, You set him off so well. What will you take Sir To beate a fellow for me, that thus wrongd me? Bra. To beate him say you? Leop. Yes, beate him to lamenesse, To cut his lips or nose off; any thing, That may disfigure him. Bra. Let me consider? Five hundred pistollets for such a service I thinke were no deare penniworth. Zab. Five hundred! Why there are of your brother-hood in the Citie, Ile undertake shall kill a man for twenty. Bra. Kill him? I think so; Ile kill any man For halfe the money. Leop. And will you aske more For a sound beating then a murther? Bra. I Sir, And with good reason, for a dog that's dead The Spanish proverb saies, will never bite: But should I beate or hurt him only, he may Recover, and kill me. Leop. A good conclusion, The obduracie of this rascall makes me tender. I'le runne some other course, there's your reward, Without the employment. Bra. For that as you please Sir; When you have need to kill a man, pray use me, But I am out at beating. Exit. Zab. What's to be done then? Leop. I'le tell thee Zabalon, and make thee privy To my most neare designes: this stranger, which Hyppolita so doates on, was my prisoner When the last Virgin, I bestowed upon her, Was made my prize; how he escap'd, hereafter J'le let thee know; and it may be the love He beares the servant, makes him scorne the Mistris. Zab. 'Tis not unlike; for the first time he saw her His lookes exprest so much, and for more proofe Since he came to my Ladies house, though yet He never knew her, he hath practis'd with me To help him to a conference, without The knowledge of Hyppolita; which I promis'd. Leop. And by all meanes performe it, for their meeting, But worke it so, that my disdainfull Mistris (Whom, notwithstanding all her injuries 'Tis my hard fate to love) may see and heare them. Zab. To what end Sir? Leop. This Zabulon: when she sees Who is her rivall, and her Lovers basenesse To leave a Princesse for her bondwoman, The sight make her scorne, what now she doates on, I'le double thy reward. Zab. You are like to speed then: For I confesse what you will soone beleeve, We serve them best that are most apt to give. For you I'le place you where you shall see all, and yet be unobserv'd. Leop. Tat I desire too. Exit. Enter Arnoldo. Arn. I cannot see her yet, how it afflicts me: The poyson of this place, should mixe it selfe With her pure thoughts? 'Twas she that was commanded Or my eyes failed me grosly; that youth, that face And all that noble sweetnesse. May shee not live here, And yet be honest still? Enter Zenocia. Zen. It is Arnoldo, From all his dangers free; fortune I blesse thee, My noble husband! how my joy swells in me, But why in this place? what businesse hath he here? He cannot heare of me, I am not known here. I left him vertuous; how I shake to thinke now? And how that joy I had, cooles, and forsakes me? Enter above Hyppolita and Zabulon. This Lady is but faire, I have beene thought so Without compare admired; Shee has bewitched him And he forgot— Arn. 'Tis she againe, the same—the same Zenocia. Zab. There they are together.—Now you may mark Hyp. Peace let 'em parly. Arn. That you are well Zenocia; and once more, Blesse my despairing eyes, with your wisht presence, I thanke the gods; but that I meete you here— Hip. They are acquainted, Zab. I found that secret Madam, When you commanded her goe home: pray heare 'em. Zen. That you meet me here, ne're blush at that Arnoldo. Your comming comes too late: I am a woman, And one woman with another may be trusted; Do you feare the house? Arn. More then a feare, I know it, Know it not good, not honest. Zen. What do you here then? I'th name of vertue why doe you approach it? Will you confesse the doubt and yet pursue it? Where have your eyes been wandring my Arnoldo? What constancy, what faith do you call this? Fie, Aime at one wanton marke, and wound another? I doe confesse, the Lady faire, most beauteous, Leopold places himself unseen below. And able to betray a strong mans liberty, But you that have a love, a wife—you do well To deale thus wisely with me: yet Arnoldo, Since you are pleas'd to studie a new beauty, And think this old and ill, beaten with misery. Studie a nobler way for shame to love me, Wrong not her honesty. Arn. You have confirm'd me. Zen. Who though shee be your wife, will never hinder you, So much I rest a servant to your wishes, And love your Loves, though they be my destructions, No man shall know me, nor the share I have in thee, No eye suspect, I am able to prevent you, For since I am a slave to this great Lady, Whom I perceive you follow Arn. Be not blinded. Zen. Fortune shall make me useful to your service, I will speake for you. Arn. Speake for me? you wrong me. Zen. I will endeavour all the wayes I am able To make her think well of you; will that please, To make her dote upon you, dote to madnesse, So far against my selfe I will obey you. But when that's done, and I have shewed this duty This great obedience, few will buy it at my price, Thus will I shake hands with you, wish you well, But never see you more, nor receive comfort From any thing, Arnoldo. Arn. You are too tender; I neither doubt you, nor desire longer To be a man, and live, then I am honest And only yours; our infinite affections Abus'd us both. Zab. Where are your favours now? The courtesies you shew'd this stranger, Madam? Hip. Have I now found the cause? Zab. Attend it further. Zen. Did she invite you doe you say? Arn. Most cunningly, And with a preparation of that state I was brought in and welcom'd. Zen. Seem'd to love you? Arn. Most infinitly, at first sight, most dotingly. Zen. Shee is a goodly Lady; Arn. Wondrous handsome: At first view, being taken unprepar'd, Your memory, not present then to assist me, Shee seem'd so glorious sweet, and so far stird me, Nay be not jealous, there's no harme done. Zen. Prethee—didst thou not kisse Arnoldo? Arn. Yes faith did I. Zen. And then— Arn. I durst not, did not— Zen. I forgive you, Come tell the truth. Arn. May be I lay with her. Hip. He mocks me too, most basely. Zen. Did yee faith? did ye forget so far? Arn. Come, come, no weeping; I would have lyen first in my grave, beleeve that. Why will you aske those things you would not heare? Shee is too untemperate to betray my vertues Too openly lascivious: had she dealt But with that seeming modesty she might, And flung a little Art upon her ardor, But 'twas forgot, and I forgot to like her, And glad I was deceiv'd. No my Zenocia, My first love here begun, rests here unreapt yet, And here for ever. Zen. You have made me happy, Even in the midst of bondage blest. Zab. You see now What rubs are in your way. Hipo. And quickly Zabulon I'le roote 'em out.—Be sure you do this presently. Zab. Doe not you alter then. Hipo. I am resolute. Exit Zab. Arn. To see you only I came hither last, Drawne by no love of hers, nor base allurements, For by this holy light I hate her heartily. Leop. I am glad of that you have sav'd me so much vengeance And so much feare From this hour, faire befall you. Arn. Some meanes I shall make shortly to redeem you, Till when, observe her well, and fit her temper, Only her lust contemn. Zen. When shal I see you? Arn. I will live here abouts, and bear her faire stil, Till I can finde a fit houre to redeeme you. Hyp. Shut all the dores; Arn. Who's that? Zen. We are betray'd, The Lady of the house has heard our parley, Seene us, and seen our Loves. Hyp. You courteous Gallant, You that scorn all I can bestow, that laugh at The afflictions, and the grones I suffer for you, That slight and jeere my love, contemn the fortune, My favours can fling on you, have I caught you? Have I now found the cause? yee foole my wishes? Is mine own slave, my bane? I nourish that That sucks up my content. I'le pray no more, Nor wooe no more; thou shalt see foolish man, And to thy bitter paine and anguish, looke on The vengeance I shall take, provok'd and sleighted; Redeem her then, and steale her hence: ho Zabulon Now to your worke. Enter Zabulon and servants, some holding Arnoldo, some ready with a cord to strangle Zenocia. Arn. Lady, but heare me speake first, As you have pitty. Hyp. I have none. You taught me, When I even hung about your necke, you scorn'd me. Zab. Shall we pluck yet? Hyp. No, hold a little Zabulon, I'le pluck his heart-strings first: now am I worthy A little of your love? Arn. I'le be your servant, Command me through what danger you shall aime at, Let it be death. Hyp. Be sure Sir, I shall fit you. Arn. But spare this Virgin; Hyp. I would spare that villain first, Had cut my Fathers throate. Arn. Bounteous Lady, If in your sexe there be that noble softnesse, That tendernesse of heart, women are crown'd for— Zen. Kneele not Arnoldo, doe her not that honour, She is not worthy such submission, I scorne a life depends upon her pitty. Proud woman do thy worst, and arme thy anger, With thoughts as blacke as hell, as hot and bloody, I bring a patience here, shall make 'em blush, An innocence, shall outlook thee, and death too. Arn. Make me your slave, I give my freedome to ye, For ever to be fetterd to your service; 'Twas I offended, be not so unjust then, To strike the innocent, this gentle maid, Never intended feare and doubt against you: Shee is your servant, pay not her observance With cruell looks, her duteous faith with death. Hyp. Am I faire now? now am I worth your liking? Zen. Not faire, not to be liked, thou glorious Divell, Thou vernisht piece of lust, thou painted fury. Arn. Speake gently sweet, speak gently; Zen. I'le speak nobly. 'Tis not the saving of a life I aime at, Marke me lascivious woman, mark me truly, And then consider, how I weigh thy angers. Life is no longer mine, nor deare unto me, Then usefull to his honour, I preserve it If thou hadst studied all the courtesies Humanity and nobleblood, ar linke too, Thou couldst not have propounded such a benefit, Nor heapt upon me such unlookt for honour As dying for his sake, to be his Martyr, 'Tis such a grace. Hyp. You shall not want that favour, Let your bones worke miracles. Arn. Dear Lady By those faire eyes— Hyp. There is but this way left ye To save her life.— Arn. Speake it, and I embrace it. Hyp. Come to my private chamber presently And there, what love and I command— Arn. I'le doe it, Be comforted Zenocia. Zen. Do not do this, To save me, do not loose your selfe I charge you, I charge you by your love, that love you beare me; That love, that constant love you have twin'd to me, By all your promises, take heed you keep 'em, Now is your constant tryall. If thou dost this, Or mov'st one foote, to guide thee to her lust, My curses and eternall hate pursue thee. Redeem me at the base price of disloyalty? Must my undoubted honesty be thy bawd too? Goe and intwine thy selfe about that body? Tell her, for my life thou hast lost thine honour, Pulld all thy vowes from heaven, basely, most basely To add an hour to me that hate thee for it, Stoop'd to the servile flames of that foule woman Know thee againe, nor name thee for a husband. Arn. What shall I doe to save her? Hyp. How now, what hast there? Enter a Servant. Ser. The Governour, attended with some Gentlemen, Are newly entered, to speake with your Ladiship. Hyp. Poxe ô their businesse, reprieve her for this hour, I shall have other time. Arn. Now fortune help us. Hyp. I'le meete 'em presently: retire a while all. Exit. Zab. You rise to day upon your right side Lady; You know the danger too, and may prevent it, And if you suffer her to perish thus, As she must doe, and suddenly beleeve it, Unlesse you stand her friend; you know the way on't, I ghesse you poorely love her, lesse your fortune. Let her know nothing, and performe this matter, There are hours ordained for severall businesses, You understand. Arn. I understand you bawd Sir, And such a Councellour I never car'd for. Enter the Governour, Clodio, Leopold, Charino and Attendants at one doore, Hyppolita at the other. Hyp. Your Lordship does me honour. Gover. Faire Hyppolita, I am come to ease you of a charge. Hyp. I keepe none, I count a burthen Sir: and yet I lye too. Gover. Which is the maide; is she here? Clod. Yes Sir, This is she, this is Zenocia, The very same I sued to your Lordship for. Zen. Clodio againe? more misery? more ruine? Under what angry starre is my life govern'd. Gover. Come hither maid, you are once more a free woman Here I discharge your bonds. Arn. Another smile, Another tricke of fortune to betray us! Hyp. Why do's your Lordship use me so unnobly? Against my will, to take away my bond-woman? Gov. She was no lawfull prize, therefore no bond-woman: She's of that Countrey we hold friendship with, And ever did, and therefore to be used With entertainment, faire and courteous. The breach of league in us gives foule example, Therefore you must be pleas'd to think this honest; Did you know what she was? Leop. Not till this instant; For had I known her, she had been no prisoner. Gover. There, take the maid, she is at her owne dispose now, And if there be ought else to do your honour Any poore service in— Clod. I am vowed your servant; Arn. Your Father's here too, that's our only comfort, And in a Countrey now, we stand free people, Where Clodio has no power, be comforted. Zen. I feare some trick yet. Arn. Be not so dejected. Gover. You must not be displeas'd; so farewell Lady. Come Gentlemen; Captain, you must with me too, I have a little businesse. Leop. I attend your Lordship: Now my way's free, and my hopes. Lords againe. Exeunt all but Hyp. &amp; Zab. Hyp. Dy'e jeere me now ye are going? I may live yet—to make you howle both. Zab. You might have done; you had power then, But now the chaines are off, the command lost, And such a story they will make of this To laugh out lazie time. Hyp. No meanes yet left me? For now I burst with anger: none to satisfie me? No comfort? no revenge? Zab. You speake too late; You might have had all these, your usefull servants Had you been wise, and suddain; What power, or will Over her beauty, have you now? by violence To constrain his love; she is as free as you are, And no law can impeach her liberty, And whilst she is so, Arnoldo will despise you. Hyp. Either my love or anger must be satisfied, Or I must dye. Zab. I have a way woo'd do it, Woo'd do it yet, protect me from the Law. Hyp. From any thing; thou knowest what power I have What money, and what friends. Zab. 'Tis a divellish one: But such must now be us'd: walke in, I'le tell you; And if you like it, if the Divell can doe any thing. Hyp. Divell, or what thou wilt, so I be satisfied. Exeunt. Enter Sulpitia, Jaques. Sulp. This is the rarest, and the lustiest fellow, And so be stirs himselfe— Jaq. Give him breath Mistris You'l melt him else. Sulp. He does perform such wonders— The women are mad on him. Jaq. Give him breath I say; The man is but a man, he must have breath. Sulp. How many had he yesterday? And they paid bravely too. Jaq. About fourteene. But still I cry give breath, spare him and have him. Sulp. Five Dames to day; this was a small stage He may endure five more. Jaq. Breath, breath I cry still; Body ô me give breath, the man's a lost man else. Feede him and give him breath. Enter 2. Gentlewomen. Sulp. Welcome Gentlewomen, Y'are very welcome. 1 Gen. We heare you have a lusty &amp; wel-complexion'd fellow That does rare tricks, my sister and my selfe here, Would trifle out an houre or two so, please you. Sulp. Jaques, conduct 'em in. Both. There's for your courtesie. Exeunt Jaqu. and Gent. Sulp. Good pay stil, good round pay, this happy fellow Will set me up againe, he brings in gold Faster then I have leisure to receive it. O that his body were not flesh and fading; But I'le so papp him up—nothing too deare for him; What a sweee sent he has?—Now what newes Jaques? Jaq. He cannot last, I pitty the poorman I suffer for him; two coaches of young City dames, And they drive as the Divell were in the wheeles, Are ready now to enter: and behind these An old dead-palsied Lady in a litter, And she makes all the hast she can; the man's lost, You may gather up his dry bones to make nine-pins, But for his flesh. Sulp. These are but easie labours, Yet, for I know he must have rest. Jaq. He must:—you'l beate him off his leggs else presently. Sulp. Goe in, and bid him please himselfe, I am pleas'd too: To morrow's a new day; but if he can I would have him take pity ô the old Lady. Alas 'tis charity. Jaq. I'le tell him all this And if he be not too fool-hardy. Enter Zabulon. Sulp. How now? What newes with you? Zab. You must presently Shew all the art you have, and for my Lady. Sulp. She may command. Zab. You must not dream nor trifle. Sulp. Which way? Zab. A spell you must prepare, a powerfull one, Peruse but these directions, you shall find all; There is the picture too, be quicke, and Faithfull, And do it with that strength—When 'tis perform'd Pitch your reward at what you please, you have it. Sulp. Ile do my best, and suddainly, but hark ye, Will you never lye at home againe? Zab. Excuse me, I have too much businesse yet. Sulp. I am right glad on't. Zab. Think on your businesse, so farewell. Sulp. I'le do it. Zab. Within this houre I'le visit you againe And give you greater lights. Sulp. I shall observe ye; This brings a brave reward, bravely I'le do it And all the hidden art I have, express in't. Ex. at both dores. Enter Rutillio with a night-cap. Rut. Now do I look as if I were Crow-trodden, Fy how my hams shrinke under me; ô me, I am broken-winded too; Is this a life? Is this the recreation I have aimd at, I had a body once, a handsome body, And wholsome too. Now I appeare like a rascall That had been hung a yeare or two in gibbets. Fye how I faint; Women? keep me from women; Place me before a Cannon, 'tis a pleasure; Stretch me upon a rack, a recreation; But women? women? ô the Divell! women? Curtius gulfe was never halfe so dangerous. Is there no way to finde the trap-dore againe, And fall into the Cellar, and be taken? No lucky fortune to direct me that way? No galleys to be got, nor yet no gallows? For I feare nothing now, no earthly thing But these unsatisfied Men-leeches, women. How divellishly my bones ake: ô the old Lady! I have a kind of waiting-woman, lyes crosse my back too, O how she stings! no treason to deliver me? Now what are you? do you mock me? Enter 3. with night-caps very faintly. 1. No Sir, no, We were your Predecessors in this place, 2. And come to see you beare up. Rut. Good Gentlemen; You seem to have a snuffing in your head Sir, A parlous snuffing, but this same dampish aire— 2. A dampish aire indeed. Rut. Blow your face tenderly, Your nose will ne're endure it: mercy ô me, What are men change'd to here? is my nose fast yet? Mee thinks it shakes it'h hilts: pray tell me Gentlemen, How long is't since you flourisht here? 3. Not long since. Rut. Move your selfe easily, I see you are tender, Nor long endured. 2. The labour was so much Sir And so few to perform it.— Rut. Must I come to this? And draw my legs after me like a lame dog? I cannot run away, I am too feeble: Will you sue for this place againe Gentlemen? 1. No truly sir, the place has been too warm for our complexions. 2. We have enough on't, rest you merry sir, We came but to congratulate your fortune, You have abundance. 3. Beare your fortune soberly, And so we leave you to the next faire Lady. Exit the 3. Rut. Stay but a little, and I'le meet you Gentlemen, At the next Hospitall: ther's no living thus, Nor am I able to endure it longer, With all the helps and heates that can be given me, I am at my trot already; they are faire and young Most of the women that repaire unto me, But they stick on like burs, shake me like feathers. Enter Sulpitia. More women yet? Would I were honestly married, To any thing that had but halfe a face, And not a groate to keep her, nor a smocke, That I might be civilly merry when I pleased, Rather then labouring in these fulling mills. Sulp. By this the spell begins to worke: you are lusty, I see you beare up bravely yet. Rut. Doe you heare Lady, Do not make a game-beare of me, to play me hourly, And fling on all your whelps; it will not hold; Play me with some discretion; to day one course, And two dayes hence another. Sulp. If you be so angry Pay backe the money I redeem'd you at And take your course; I can have men enough: You have lost me an hundred crowns since you came hither, In broths and strengthning caudles; till you do pay me, If you will eate and live, you shall endeavour, I'le chain you to't else. Rut. Make me a dog-kennel, I'le keep your house and bark, and feed on bare bones, And be whipt out a dores, Doe you mark me Lady? whipt, I'le eate old shoes. Enter Duart. Dua. In this house, I am told There is a stranger, of a goodly person, And such a one there was; if I could see him, I yet remember him. Sulp. Your businesse Sir, If it be for a woman, ye are cozend, I keepe none here. Exit. Dua. Certain this is the Gentleman, The very same. Rut. Death, if I had but money, Or any friend to bring me from this bondage, I would thrash, set up a Coblers shop, keepe hogs, And feede with 'em, sell tinder boxes, And Knights of Ginger-bread, thatch for three Halfe pence a day, and thinke it Lordly, From this base stallion trade: Why does he ey me, Eye me so narrowly? Dua. It seemes you are troubled Sir, I heard you speak of want; Rut. 'Tis better hearing Far, then releiving Sir. Dua. I do not think so, you know me not. Rut. Not yet that I remember. Dua. You shall, and for your friend: I am beholding to yee Greatly beholding Sir, If you remember, You fought with such a man, they cal'd Duart, A proud distemper'd man: he was my enemie, My mortall foe, you slew him fairly, nobly. Rut. Speake softly Sir, you do not meane to betray me I wisht the Gallows, now th'are comming fairely. Dua. Be confident, for as I live, I love you, And now you shall perceive it: for that service Me, and my purse command: there, take it to ye, 'Tis gold, and no small sum, a thousand duckets, Supply your want. Rut. But do you do this faithfully? Dua. If I mean ill, spit in my face and kicke me, In what else I may serve you, Sir— Rut. I thanke you, This is as strange to me as Knights adventure. I have a project, 'tis an honest one, And now I'le tempt my fortune. Dua. Trust me with it. Rut. You are so good and honest I must trust ye, 'Tis but to carry a letter to a Lady That sav'd my life once. Dua. That will be most thankfull, I will do't with all care. Rut. Where are you, white-broth? Now lusty blood, Come in, and tell your money: 'Tis ready here, no threats, nor no orations, Nor prayers now. Sulp. You do not meane to leave me— Rut. I'le live in hell sooner then here, and cooler. Come quickly come, dispatch, this ayers unwholsome: Quickly good Lady, quickly to't. Sulp. Well, since it must be, The next, I'le fetter faster sure, and closer. Rut. And picke his bones, as y'ave done mine, poxe take ye. Dua. At my lodging for a while, you shall be quarterd, And there take physick for your health. Rut. I thanke ye I have found my Angel now too, if I can keepe him. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quinti Scæna Prima. Enter Rutillio and Duart. Rut. You like the Letter. Dua. Yes, but I must tell you, You tempt a desperate hazard, to sollicite The mother, (and the grieved one too, 'tis rumord) Of him you slew so lately. Rut. I have told you Some proofes of her affection, and I know not A neerer way to make her satisfaction For a lost Sonne, then speedily to help her To a good husband; one that will beget Both sons and daughters, if she be not barren. I have had a breathing now, and have recovered What I lost in my late service, 'twas a hot one: It fir'd and fir'd me; but all thanks to you Sir, You have both freed and cool'd me. Dua. What is done Sir I thought well done, and was in that rewarded, And therefore spare your thanks. Rut. I'le no more whoring: This fencing twixt a paire of sheets, more weare one Then all the exercise in the world besides. To be drunk with good Canary, a meere Julip Or like gourd-water to't; twenty surfets Come short of one nights work there. If I get this Lady As ten to one I shall; I was ne're denied yet, I will live wondrous honestly; walk before her Gravely, and demurely And then instruct my family; you are sad, What do you muse on Sir?

Give me a booke, I'le swear't; Denyed me to the Officers, that pursued me, Brought me her selfe to'th dore, then gave me gold To beare my charges, and shall I make doubt then But that she lov'd me? I am confident Time having tane her griefe off, that I shall be Most welcome to her: for then to have wooed her Had been unseasonable. Dua. well Sir, there's more money, To make you handsome; I'le about your businesse: You know where you must stay. Rut. There you shall finde me: Would I could meete my brother now, to know, Whither the Jew, his Genius, or my Christian, Has prov'd the better friend. Exit. Dua. O who would trust Deceiving woman! or beleeve that one The best, and most canoniz'd ever was More then a seeming goodnesse! I could raile now Against the sexe, and curse it; but the theame And way's too common: yet that Guiomar My mother; (nor let that forbid her to be The wonder of our nation) she that was Mark'd out the great example, for all Matrons Both wife and Widow; shee that in my breeding Exprest the utmost of a mothers care, And tendernesse to a sonne; she that yet faines Such sorrow for me; good God, that this mother, After all this, should give up to a stranger, The wreake she owed her sonne; I feare her honour. That he was sav'd, much joyes me, and grieve only That she was his preserver. I'le try further, And by this Engine, find whether the teares, Of which, she is so prodigall, are for me, Or us'd to cloake her base hypocrisy. Exit. Enter Hypolita and Sulpitia. Hyp. Are you assur'd the charme prevailes? Sulp. Do I live? Or you speake to me? Now, this very instant Health takes its last leave of her; maugre palenesse Like winter, nips the Roses and the lillies, The Spring that youth, and love adorn'd her face with. To force affection, is beyond our art, For I have prov'd all meanes that hell has taught me, Or the malice of a woman, which exceeds it, To change Arnoldoe's love, but to no purpose: But for your bond-woman. Hyp. Let her pine and dye; She remov'd; which like a brighter sun, Obscures my beames, I may shine out againe, And as I have been, be admir'd and sought to: How long has she to live? Sulp. Lady, before The Sun twice rise and set, be confident, She is but dead; I know my Charme hath found her Nor can the Governours guard; her lovers teares; Her Fathers sorrow, or his power that freed her, Defend her from it. Enter Zabulon. Zab. All things have succeeded, As you could wish; I saw her brought sick home; The image of pale death, stampt on her fore-head. Let me adore this second Hecate, This great Commandresse, of the fatall sisters, That as she pleases, can cut short, or lengthen The threed of life. Hip. Where was she, when the inchantment First ceas'd upon her. Zab. Taking the fresh aire, In the company of the Governour, and Count Clodio Arnoldo too, was present with her Father, When, in a moment (so the servants told me) As she was giving thanks to the Governour, And Clodio, for her unexpected freedome, As if she had been blasted, she sunk down, To their amazement. Hyp. 'Tis thy master-piece Which I will so reward, that thou shalt fixe here, And with the hazard of thy life, no more Make tryall of thy powerfull Art; which known Our Lawes call death: off with this Magicall robe, And be thy selfe. Enter Governour, Clodio, and Charino. Sulp. Stand close, you shall heare more. Go:, Man. You must have patience; all rage is vain now, And piety forbids, that we should question What is decreed above, or aske a reason Why heaven determines this or that way of us. Clod. Heaven has no hand in't; 'tis a work of hell. Her life hath been so innocent, all her actions So free from the suspition of crime, As rather she deserves a Saints place here, Then to endure, what now her sweetenesse suffers. Charin. Not for her fault, but mine Sir; Zenocia suffers, The sin I made, when I sought to rase downe Arnoldos love, built, on a Rock of truth, Now to the height is punish'd. I professe, Had he no birth, nor parts, the present sorrowes He now expresses for her, does deserve her Above all Kings, though such had been his riuals. Clod. All Ancient stories, of the love of husbands To vertuous wives, be now no more remembred. Char. The tales of Turtles, ever be forgotten, Or, for his sake beleev'd. Man. I have heard, there has been Betweene some married paires, such sympathy, That th'husband, has felt really, the throwes His wife then teeming suffers, this true griefe, Confirms, 'tis not impossible. Clod. Wee shall finde Fit time for this hereafter; lets' use now All possible meanes to help her. Man. Care, nor cost, Nor what Physitians can do, shall be wanting; Make use of any meanes, or men. Char. You are noble. Exeunt. Man. Clod. Charino. Sulp. Ten Colledges of Doctors shall not save her. Her fate is in your hand. Hipo. Can I restore her? Sulp. If you command my Art. Hip. I'le dye my selfe first. And yet I'le goe visit her, and see This miracle of sorrow in Arnoldo: And 'twere for me, I should change places with her, And dye most happy, such a lovers teares, Were a rich monument, but too good for her; Whose misery I glory in: come Sulpitia, You shall a long with me, good Zabulon Be not farr off. Zab. I will attend you Madam. Exeunt Enter Duarte. and a Servant Ser. I have serv'd you, from my youth, and ever You have found me faithfull: that you lives a treasure I'le locke up here; nor shall it be let forth, But when you give me warrant. Dua. I rely, Vpon thy faith; nay, no more protestations, Too many of them, will call that in question, Which now I doubt not, she is there. Ser. Alone too But take it on my life your entertainment, Appearing as you are, will bee but course For the displeasure, I shall undergoe; I am prepar'd. Dua. Leave me, I'le stand the hazard. Exit Servant. The silence that's observ'd, her close retirements No visitance admitted, not the day; These sable colours, all signes of true sorrow, Or hers is deeply counterfeit. I'le looke neerer, Manners give leave—she fits upon the ground; By heaven she weepes; my picture in her hand too; She kisses it and weepes againe. Enter Guiomart. Guio. Whose there? Dua. There is no starting back now Madam. Guio. Ha, another murderer, I'le not protect thee, Though I have no more Sonnes. Dua. Your pardon Lady, Ther's no such foule fact taints me Guio. What makes thou here then? Where are my Servants, do none but my sorrowes Attend upon me? speake, what brought thee hither? Dua. A will, to give you comfort. Guio. Thou art but a man. And 'tis beyond a humane reach to do it If thou could raise the dead out of their graues. Bid time run back, make me now what I was, A happy Mother: gladly I would heare thee, But that's impossible. Dua. Please you but to read this; You shall know better there, why I am sent Then if I should deliver it Guio. From whom comes it? Dua. That will instruct you; I suspect this stranger, Yet she spake something, that holds such alliance, With his reports I know not what to thinke on't; What a frown was ther? she looks me through, &amp; through, Now reades againe, now pauses, and now smiles; And yet there's more of anger in't then mirth, These are strange changes; oh I understand it She's full of serious thoughts. Guio. You are just you Heavens, And never do forget to heare their prayers, That truly pay their vowes, the defer'd vengeance, For you, and my words sake so long defer'd, Under which as a mountaine, my heart groanes yet When 'twas dispair'd of, now is offerd to me; And if I loose it, I am both wayes guilty, The womans maske, dissimulation help me; Come hither freind, I am sure you know the Gentleman, That sent these charms. Duar. Charms Lady? Guio. These charms; I well may call them so, th'ave won upon me, More then ere letter did; thou art his freind, (The confidence he has in thee, confirmes it) And therefore I'le be open breasted to thee, To heare of him, though yet, I never saw him, Was most desir'd of all men; let me blush, And then I'le say I love him. Dua. All men see, In this a womans vertue. Guio. I expected For the courtesie I did, long since to have seene him, And though I then forbad it, you men know, Betweene our harts and tongues, there's a large distance; But I'le excuse him, may be hitherto, He has forborne it, in respect my Sonne Fell by his hand. Dua. And reason Lady. Guio. No, he did me a pleasure in't, a riotous fellow, And with that insolent, not worth the owning; I have indeed kept a long solemne sorrow, For my freinds sake partly; but especially For his long absence. Dua. O the Devill! Guio. Therefore, Bid him bee speedy; a Preist shall be ready To tye the holy knot; this kisse I send him, Deliver that and bring him. Dua. I am dumbe: A good cause I have now, and a good sword, And something I shall do, I wait upon you. Exeunt. Enter Mannuel. Charino. Arnoldo. Zenocio, borne in a chaire. 2. Doctors. Clodio. Doct. Give her more ayre shee dyes else. Arn. O thou dread power, That mad'st this all, and of thy workemanship, This virgin wife, the Master peice, looke downe on her; Let her minds virtues, cloth'd in this faire garment, That worthily deserves, a better name Then flesh and bloud, now sue, and prevaile for her. Or if those are denyed, let innocence, To which, all passages in heaven stand open, Appeare in her white robe, before thy throne; And mediate for her: or If this age of sinne, Be worthy of a miracle, the Sun In his diurnall progresse never saw, So sweete a subject to imploy it on. Man. Wonders are ceas'd Sir, we must worke by meanes, Arno. 'Tis true and such reverend Physitians are; To you—thus low I fall then; so may you ever Be stil'd the hands of heaven, natures restorers; Get wealth and honours.; and by your successe, In all your undertakings, propagate Your great opinion in the world, as now You use your saving Art; for know good Gentlemen. Besides the fame, and all that I possess, For a reward, posterity shall stand Indebted to you, for (as heaven forbid it) Should my Zenocia dye, robbing this age, Of all that's good or gracefull, times succeeding, The story of her pure life not yet perfect, Will suffer in the want of her example. Doct. Were all the world to perish with her, wee Can do no more; then what art and experience Gives us assurance of, we have us'd all meanes To finde the cause of her disease, yet cannot; How should we then, promise the cure? Arn. Away, I did bely you, when I charg'd you with The power of doing; yee are meere names only, And even your best perfection, accidentall; What ever malady thou art, or spirit, As some hold, all diseases that afflict us, As love, already makes me sensible Of halfe her sufferings, ease her of her part, And let me stand the butt, of thy fell malice, And I will sweare th'art mercifull. Doct. Your hand Lady; What a strange heat is heare? bring some warme water. Arn. She shall use nothing that is yours; my sorrow, Provides her of a better bath, my teares, Shall do that office. Zeno. O my best Arnoldo! The truest of all lovers! I would live Were heaven so pleas'd, but to reward your sorrow, With my true service; but since that's denied me, May you live long and happy: do not suffer, (By your affection to me I conjure you) My sicknesse to infect you; though much love Makes you too subject to it. Arn. In this onely Zenocia Wrongs her servant; can the body Subsist, the soule departed? 'tis as easy As I to live without you; I am your husband, And long have been so, though our adverse fortune, Banding us, from one hazard to another, Would never grant me so much happinesse, As to pay a husbands debt; despite of fortune, In death I'le follow you, and guarde mine owne; And there enjoy what heere my fate forbids me. Clod. So true a sorrow, and so feelingly Exprest, I never read of. Man. I am strooke With wonder to behold it, as with pitty Char. If you that are a stranger, suffer for them, Being tied no further then humanity Leades you to soft compassion; thinke great Sir, What of necessity I must endure, That am a Father? Hypolita. Zabulon and Sulpitia at the dore. Zab. Waite me there, I hold it Unfit to have you seene; as I finde cause, You shall proceed, Man. You are welcome Lady. Hypo. Sir, I come to do a charitable office, How does the patient? Clod. You may enquire Of more then one; for two are sick, and deadly, He languishes in her, her healths, despaird of, And in hers, his. Hypo. 'Tis a strange spectacle, With what a patience, they sit unmov'd? Are they not dead already? Doct. By her pulse, She cannot last a day. Arn. Oh by that summons, I know my time too! Hypo. Looke to the man. Clod. Apply Your Art, to save the Lady, preserve her, A towne is your reward. Hypo. I'le treble it, In ready gold, if you restore Arnoldo; For in his death I dye too. Clod. without her, I am no more. Arn. Are you there Madam? now You may feast on my miseries; my coldnesse In answering your affections; or hardnesse, Give it what name you please, you are reveng'd of; For now you may perceive, our thred of life Was spun together, and the poore Arnoldo, Made only to enjoy the best Zenocia, And not to serve the use of any other; And in that she may equall, my Lord Clodio, Had long since else enjoyed her, nor could I Have been so blinde, as not to see your great And many excellencies farr, farr beyond Or my deservings, or my hopes; we are now Going our latest journey, and together, Our onely comfort we desire, pray give it Your charitie to our ashes, such wee must be, And not to curse our memoryes. Hypo. I am much mov'd. Clod. I am wholly overcome, all love to women, Farewell for ever, ere you dye, your pardon; And yours Sir; had she many yeares to live, Perhaps I might looke on her, as a Brother, But as a lover never; and since all Your sad misfortunes, had originall From the barbarons custome practiz'd in my Countrey, Heaven witnesse, for your sake I here release it; So to your memory, chast Wives and Virgins Shall ever pay their vowes. I give her to you; And wish, she were so now, as when my lust Forc'd you; to quite the Countrey. Hypo. It is in vaine, To strive with destiny, here my dotage ends, Looke up Zenocia, health in me speakes to you; She giues him to you, that by divers wayes, So long has kept him from you: and repent not, That you were once my servanr, for which health In recompence of what I made you suffer, The hundred thousand Crownes, the Citie owes me, Shall be your dower. Man. 'Tis a magnificent guift, Had it beene timely given. Hypo. It is beleeve it; Sulpitia? Enter. a Servant. and Sulpitia. Sulp. Madam Hyp. Quicke, undoe the charme; Aske not a reason why; let it suffice, It is my will. Sulp. Which I obey and gladly. Exit. Man. Is to be married sayest thou? Ser. So she sayes sir, And does desire your presence. They are borne off in chaires Man. And tell her i'le come. Hyp. Pray carry them to their rest; for though already, They do appeare as dead, let my life pay for't, If they recover not. Man. What you have warranted, Assure your selfe, will be expected from you; Looke to them carefully; and till the tryall, Hypo. Which shall not be above foure howers. Man. Let me Intreate your companies: there is something Of waight, invites me hence. All. weell waite upon you. Exeunt. Enter. Guiomar. and Servants. Guio. You understand what my directions are, And what they guide you to; the faithfull promise, You have made me all. All. We do and will performe it. Guio. The Governour will not faile to be here presently Retire a while, till you shall finde occasion, And bring me word, when they arrive. All. Wee shall Madam. Guio. Onely stay you to entertaine; 1. Ser. I am ready Guio. I wonder at the bold, and practis'd malice, Men ever haue a foote, against our honours, That nothing we can do, never so verteous, No shape put on so pious, no not thinke What a good is, be that good ne're so noble, Never so Laden with admir'd example, But still we end in lust; our aimes our actions, Nay, even our charities, with lust are branded; Why should this stranger else, this wretched stranger, Whose life I sav'd at what deare price, stick here yet? Why should he hope, he was not here an hower, And certainly in that time, I may sweare it I gave him no loose looke, I had no reason; Unlesse my teares were flames, my curses courtships; The killing of my Sonne, a kindnesse to me, Why should he send to me, or with what safety (Examining the ruine he had wrought me) Though at that time, my pious pitty found him, And my word fixt; I am troubled, strongly troubled. Enter. a Servant. Ser. The Gentlemen are come, Guio. Then bid 'em welcome—I must retire. Exit. Enter. Rutillio. and Duarte. You are welcome home Gentlemen. Rut. I thank you freind, I would speak with your Lady. Ser. I'le let her understand. Exit. Rut. It shall befit you, How do I looke Sir, in this handsome trim? Exit. Servant. Me thinks I am woundrous brave. Duar. You are very decent. Rut. These by themselves, without more helps of nature, Would set a woman hard; I know 'em all, And where their first aimes light; I'le lay my head on't, I'le take her eye, as soone as she lookes on me, And if I come to speake once, woe be to her, I have her in a nooze, she cannot scape me; I have their severall lasts. Dua. You are throughly studied, But tel me Sir, being unacquainted with her, As you confesse you are— Rut. That's not an howers worke, I'le make a nun forget her beades in two houres. Dua. She being set in yeares next, none of those lusters Appearing in her eye,, that warme the fancy; Nor nothing in her face, but handsome ruines. Rut. I love old storyes; those live beleev'd, Authentique, When 20. of your moderne faces, are cald in, For new opinion paintings, and corruptions, Give me an old confirm'd face; besides she sav'd me, She sav'd my life, have I not cause to love her? Shee's rich and of a constant state, a faire one Have I not cause to wooe her? I have tryed sufficient, All your young Phillies, I thinke this back has tryed 'em, And smarted for it too: they run away with me, Take bitt betweene the teeth, and play the Divels; A staied pace now becomes my yeares; a sure one, Where I may sit and cracke no girthes. Dua. How miserable, If my Mother should confirme, what I suspect now, Beyond all humane cure were my condition? Then I shall wish, this body had been so too, Here comes the Lady Sir. Enter. Guiomar. Rut. Excellent Lady, To shew I am a creature, bound to your service, And onely yours— Guio. Keepe at that distance Sir; For if you stirr— Rut. I am obedient, She has found already, I am for her turne; With what a greedy hawkes eye she beholds me? Marke how she musters all my parts. Guio. A goodly Gentleman, Of a more manly set, I never look'd on. Rut. Marke, marke her eye still; marke but the carriage of 'em Guio. How happy am I now; since my Sonne fell, He fell not, by a base unnoble hand? As that still troubled me; how farr more happy Shall my revenge be, since the sacrifice, I offer to his grave, shall be both worthy, A Sonnes untimely losse, and a Mothers sorrow? Rut. Sir, I am made beleeve it; she is mine owne, I told you what a spell I carried with me, All this time does she spend, in contemplation, Of that unmatch'd delight: I shall be thankfull to yee; And if you please to know my house, to use it; To take it for your owne. Guio. Who waites without there? Enter. Guard. and Servants. they seize upon Rut. &amp; bind him. Rut. How now? what meanes this, Lady? Guio. Binde him fast. Rut. Are these the bride-lases you prepare for me? The colours that you give? Dua. Fy gentle Lady, This is not noble dealing. Guio. Be you satisfied, It seemes you are a stranger to this meaning, You shall not be so long. Rut. Do you call this wooing—Is there no end of womens persecutions? Must I needs foole into mine owne destruction? Have I not had faire warnings, and enough too? Still pick the Divells teeth? you are not mad Lady; Do I come fairely, and like a Gentleman, To offer you that honour? Guio. You are deceiv'd Sir You come besotted, to your owne destruction: I sent not for you; what honour can ye add to me, That brake that staffe of honour, my age lean'd on? That robd me of that right, made me a Mother? Heare me thou wretched man, heare me with terrour, And let thine owne bold folly shake thy soule, Heare me pronounce thy death, that now hangs o're thee, Thou desperate foole; who bad thee seeke this ruine? What mad unmanly fate, made thee discover Thy cursed face to me againe? wast not enough To have the faire protection of my house, When misery and justice, cloose persued thee? When thine owne bloudy sword, cryed out against thee, Hatcht in the life of him? yet I forgave thee; My hospitable word, even when I saw The goodliest branch of all my blood, lopt from me, Did I not Seale still to thee? Rut. I am gon. Guio. And when thou went'st to Impe thy miserie, Did I not give thee meanes? but harke ungratefull, Was it not thus? to hide thy face and fly me? To keep thy name for ever from my memory? Thy cursed blood and kindred; did I not sweare then If ever, (in this wretched life thou hast left me, Short and unfortunate,) I saw thee againe, Or came but to the knowledge, where thou wanderdst, To call my vowe back, and pursue with vengance With all the miseryes a Mother suffers? Rut. I was borne to be hang'd, there's no auoyding it. Guio. And dar'st thou with this impudence appeare here? Walke like the winding sheete my Sonne was put in, Stand with those wounds? Dua. I am happy now againe; Happy the hower I fell, to finde a Mother, So pious good, and excellent in sorrowes. Enter. a Servant. Ser. The Governours come in. Guio. O let him enter. Rut. I have fool'd my selfe a faire thred of all my fortunes, This strikes me most; not that I feare to perish, But that this unmanerly boldnesse, has brought me to it. Enter. Governour. Clodio. Charino. Gov. Are these fit preparations for a wedding Lady? I came prepar'd a guest. Guio. O give me justice; As ever you will leave a vertuous name, Do justice, justice, Sir. Gou. You need not aske it, I am bound to it. Guio. Iustice upon this man That kild my Sonne. Gove. Do you confesse the act? Rut. Yes Sir. Clod. Rutillio? Char. 'Tis the same. Clod. How fell he thus? Here will be sorrow for the good Arnoldo. Gover. Take heed Sir what you say. Rut. I have weigh'd it well, I am the man, nor is it life I start at; Onely I am unhappy I am poore, Doore in expence of lives, there I am wretched, That I have not two lives lent me for his sacrifice; One for her Sonne, another for her sorrowes. Excellent Lady, now rejoyee againe, For though I cannot thinke, y'are pleas'd in blood, Nor with that greedy thirst pursue your vengeance; The tendernesse; even in those teares denies that; Yet let the world beleeve, you lov'd Duarte; The unmatcht courtesies you have done my miseries, Without this forfeite to the law, would charge me To tender you this life, and proud t'would please you. Guio. Shall I have justice? Gou. Yes. Rut. I'le aske it for ye, I'le follow it my selfe, against my selfe. Sir, 'Tis most sit I dye; dispatch it quickly, The monstrous burthen of that griefe she labours with Will kill her else, then blood on blood lyes on me; Had I a thousand liues, I'd give e'm all, Before I would draw one teare more from that vertue. Guio. Be not too cruell Sir, and yet his bold sword— But his life cannot restore that he's a man too— Of a faire promise, but alas my Sonnes dead; If I have justice, must it kill him? Gov. Yes. Guio. If I have not, it kills me, strong and go odly! Why should he perish too? Gou. It lies in your power, You onely may accuse him, or may quitt him. Clod. Be there no other witnesses? Guio. Not any. And if I save him, will not the world proclaime, I have forgot a Sonne, to save a murderer? And yet he lookes not like one, he lookes manly. Hyp. Pitty so brave a Gentleman should perish. She cannot be so hard, so cruell harted. Guio. Will you pronounce? yet stay a little Sir. Rut. Rid your selfe Lady, of this misery; And let me go, I do but breed more tempests, With which you are already, to much shaken. Guio. Do now, pronounce; I will not heare. Duar. You shall not, Yet turne and see good Madam. Gov. Do not wonder. 'Tis he, restor'd againe, thanke the good Doctor, Pray do not stand amaz'd, it is Duarte; Is well, is safe againe. Guio. O my sweete Sonne. I will not presse my wonder now with questions— Sir, I am sorry for that cruelty, I urg'd against you. Rut. Madam it was but justice. Duar. 'Tis true, the Doctor heald this body againe, But this man heald my soule, made my minde perfect, The good sharp lessons his sword read to me, sav'd me; For which, if you lov'd me deare Mother, Honour and love this man. Guio. You sent this letter, Rut. My boldnesse makes me blush now. Guio. I'le wipe of that, And with this kisse, I take you for my husband, Your woings done Sir; I beleeve you love me, And that's the wealth I looke for now. Rut. You have it. Duar. You have ended my desire to all my wishes. Gover. Now 'tis a wedding againe. And if Hypollito, Make good, what with the hazard of her life, She undertooke, the evening will sett cleare. Enter. Hypollita. leading Leopold. Arnoldo. Zenocia. in either band. Zabulon. Sulpitia. After a stormy day. Char. Here comes the Lady. Clod. With faire Zenocia, Health with life againe, Restor'd unto her. Zen. The guift of her goodnesse. Rut. Let us embrace, I am of your order too, And though I once despair'd of women, now, I finde they rellish much of Scorpions, For both have stings, and both can hurt, and cure too; But what have been your fortunes? Arn. Wee'le defer Our story, and at time more fit, relate it. Now all that reverence vertue, and in that Zenocias constancy, and perfect love, Or for her sake Arnoldo, joyne with us In th'honour of this Lady. Char. She deserves it. Hypo. Hypollitas life, shall make that good hereafter, Nor will I alone, better my selfe but others: For these whose wants perhaps, have made their actions Not altogether innocent, shall from me Be so supplied; that need should not compell them, To any course of life, but what the law Shall give allowance to. Zab., Sulp. Your Ladishipps creatures. Rut. Be so and no more, you man-huckster. Hypo. And worthy Leopold, you that with such fervour, So long have sought me, and in that deserv'd me, Shall now finde full reward, for all your travelles, Which you have made more deare, by patient sufferance. And though my violent dotage did transport me, Beyond those bounds, my modesty should have kept in, Though my desires were loose, from unchast art, Heaven knows I am free. Leop. The thought of that's dead to me; I gladly take your offer. Rut. Do so Sir, A peice of crackt gold, ever will weigh downe Siluer that's whole. Gov. You shall be all my guests, I must not be denyed. Arno. Come my Zenocia. Our barke at length has found a quiet harbour; And the unspotted progresse of our loves Ends not alone in safety but reward, To instruct others, by our faire example; That though good purposes, are long withstood, The hand of Heaven still guides such as are good. Ex. omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. So free this worke is, Gentlemen, from offence, That we are confident, it needes no defence From us, or from the Poets—wee dare looke. On any man, that brings his Table-booke To write downe, what againe he may repeate At some greate Table, to deserve his meate. Let such come sweld with malice, to apply What is mirth here, there for an injurie. Nor Lord, nor Lady we have tax'd; nor State, Nor any private person, their poore hate Will be starv'd heere, for envy shall not finde, One touch that may be wrested to her minde. And yet despaire not Gentlemen, The play Is quicke and witty; so the Poets say, And we believe them; the plott neate, and new, Fashiond like those, that are approv'd by you. Onely 'twill crave attention, in the most; Because one point unmark'd, the whole is lost Heare first then, and judge after, and be free, And as our cause is, let our censure be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. Why there should be an Epilogue to a Play. I know no cause, the old and usuall way, For which they were made, was to entreat the grace Of such as were spectators in this place, And time, 'tis to no purpose; for I know What you resolve already to bestow, Will not be alterd, what so ere I say, In the behalfe of us, and of the Play: Onely to quitt our doubts, if you thinke fit, You may, or cry it up; or silence it.</field>
