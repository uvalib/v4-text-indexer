      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus Scena prima: Enter the Duke of Orleans, and the Earle of Amiens at severall doores. Ame. Morrow my Lord of Orleance. Orl. You salute me like a stranger; brother Orleance were to me a Title more belonging, whom you call the husband of your sister. Ami. Would the circumstances of your brotherhood had never offer'd cause to make our conversation lesse familiar: I meet you like a hinderance in your way: your great law suit is now upon the tongue, and ready for a judgement. Orl. Came you from the Hall now? Ami. Without stay; the Court is full, and such a presse of people does attend the issue, as if some great man were brought to his araignment. Orl. Every mothers sonne of all that multitude of hearers went to be a witnesse of the misery your sisters fortunes must have come to, if my adversary who did love her first, had been her husband. Ami. The successe may draw a testimony from them to confirme the same opinion, but they went prepar'd with no such hope or purpose. Orl. And did you intreat, the number of them that are come with no such hope or purpose. Ami. Tush, your own experience of my heart can answer ye. Orl. This doubtfull, makes me clearly understand your disposition. Ami. If your cause be just, I wish you a conclusion like your cause. Orl. I can have any common charity to such a prayer From a friend I would expect a love to prosper in; Without exceptions such a love as might Make all my undertakings thankfull to't; Precisely just is seldome faithfull in our wishes To another mans desires: Farewell. Exit Orl. Enter Montague having a Purse, Duboys, Longueville, and Voramer the Page with two Caskets. Dub. Here comes your adversaries brother in law. Long. The Lord of Amiens. Dub. From the Hall I thinke. Ami. I did so: save your Lordship. Mont. That's a wish my Lord, as courteous to my present state, As ever honest mind was thankfull for; For now my safety must expose it selfe To question: yet to look for any free Or hearty salutation (sir from you) Would be unreasonable in me. Ami. Why? Mont. Your sister is my adversaries wife; That neernesse needs must consequently draw Your inclination to him. Ami. I will grant Him all the neernesse his alliance claimes, And yet be nothing lesse impartiall My Lord of Montague. Mont. Lord of Montague yet: But (sir) how long the dignity or state Belonging to it will continue, stands Upon the dangerous passage of this houre, Either for ever more to be confirm'd, Or like the time wherein twas pleaded, gone: Gone with it, never to be call'd again. Ami. Justice direct your processe to the end; To both your persons my respect shall stil Be equall; but the righteous cause is that Which bears my wishes to the side it holds, Where, ever may it prosper. Exit Amiens. Mont. Then my thanks Are proper to you, if a man may raise A confidence upon a lawfull ground I have no reason to be once perplexed With any doubtfull motion, Longueville, That Lord of Amiens, (didst observe him?) has A worthy nature in him. Long. Either tis his nature or his cunning. Mont. That's the vizard of most mens actions; Whose dissembled lives Do carry onely the similitude Of goodnesse on 'em, but for him Honest behaviour makes a true report, What disposition does inhabit him, Essentiall vertue. Long. Then tis pitty that Injurious Orleance is his brother. Dub. He is but his brother in law. Long. Law? that's as bad. Dub. How is your Law as bad? I rather wish The hangman thy executor then that Equivocation should be ominous. Enter two Lawyers, and two Creditors. Long. Some of your Lawyers.— 1 Law. What is ominous? 2 Law. Let no distrust trouble your Lordships thought. 1 Law. The evidences of your question'd land Ha' not much as any literall Advantage in 'em to be made against Your title. 2. Law. And your Councell understands The businesse fully. 1 Law. Th'are industrious, just. 2 Law. And very confident. 1 Law. Your state endures A voluntary tryall; like a man Whose honours are maliciously accus'd. 2 Law. The Accusation serves to cleare his cause. 1 Law. And to approve his truth more. 2 Law. So shall all Your adversaries pleadings strengthen your Possession. 1 Law. And be set upon record To witnesse the hereditary right Of you and yours. 2 Law. Courage, you have the law. Long. And you the profits. Mont. If discouragement Could worke upon me, your assurances Would put me strongly into heart again; But I was never fearfull: and let fate Deceive my expectation, yet I am Prepared against dejection. 1 Cred. So are we. 2 Cred. We have received a comfortable hope That all will speed well. Long. What is he Duboys? Dub. A Creditor. Long. I thought so, for he speaks As if he were a partner in his state. Mont. Sir, I am largely indebted to your loves. Long. More to their purses. Mont. Which you shall not lose. 1 Cred. Your Lordship. Dub. That's another creditor. 1 Cred. Has interest in me. Long. You have more of him. 1 Cred. And I have had so many promises From these and all your learned Conncellors, How certainly your cause wil prosper: that— Long. You brought no Serjeants with you? Dub. To attend his ill successe. Mont. Good sir, I will not be Unthankfull either to their industries Or your affections. 1 Law. All your land (my Lord) Is at the bar now, give me but ten Crowns Ile save you harmlesse. Long. Take him at his word; If he does lose, you're sav'd by miracle, For I never knew a lawyer yet undone. 1 Law. Then now you shall sir, if this prospers not. Long. Sir, I beseech you doe not force your voyce To such a loudnesse, but be thrifty now; Preserve it till you come to plead at bar It wil be much more profitable in The satisfaction then the promise. 1 Law. Is not this a satisfaction to engage My selfe for this assurance, if he— Mont. No sir, my ruine never shall import Anothers losse, if not by accident, And that my purpose is not guilty of: You are engaged in nothing but your care. Exit Law. Attend the Procurator to the Court, Observe how things incline, and bring me word. Long. I dare not sir; if I be taken there, Mine eares will be in danger. Mont. Why? hast thou Committed something that deserves thine eares? Long. No, but I feare the noyse; my hearing will be Perished by the noise; tis as good't want A member, as to loose the use— Mont. The ornament is excepted. Long. Well my Lord Ile put 'em to the hazzard. Exit Long. 1 Cred. Your desires be prosperous to you. 2 Cred. Our best prayers waite Upon your fortune. Exeunt Cred. Dub. For your selves, not him. Mont. Thou canst not blame 'em: I am in their debts. Uer. But had your large expence (a part whereof You owe 'em) for unprofitable Silkes And Laces, been bestowed among the poore, That would have prayd the right way for you: Not upon you. Mont. For unprofitable Silkes And Laces? now believe me honest boy Th'ast hit upon a reprehension that belongs Unto me. Ver. By—my Lord, I had not so unmannerly a thought, To reprehend you. Mont. Why I love thee for't. Mine own acknowledgement confirmes thy words: For once I do remember, comming from The Mercers, where my Purse had spent it selfe On those unprofitable toyes thou speakst of, A man halfe naked with his poverty Did meet me, and requested my reliefe: I wanted whence to give it, yet his eyes Spoke for him, those I could have satisfied With some unfruitfull sorrow, (if my teares Would not have added rather to his griefe, Then eas'd it) but the true compassion that I should have given I had not: this began To make me think how many such mens wants The vaine superfluous cost I wore upon My outside would have clothed, and left my selfe A habit as becomming: to encrease This new consideration there came one Clad in a garment plaine and thrifty, yet As decent as these faire deare follies; made As if it were of purpose to despise The vanity of show: his purse had still The power to doe a charitable deed, And did it. Dub. Yet your inclination, sir, Deservd no lesse to be commended, then his action. Mont. Prethee do not flatter me; He that intends well, yet deprives himselfe Of means to put his good thoughts into deed, Deceives his purpose of the due reward That goodnesse merits: O antiquity Thy great examples of Nobility Are out of imitation, or at least So lamely follow'd, that thou art as much Before this age in vertue, as in time. Dub. Sir, it must needs be lamely followed, when The chiefest men love to follow it Are for the most part cripples. Mont. Who are they? Dub. Souldiers, my Lord, souldiers. Mont. Tis true Duboys: but if the Law disables me no more For Noble actions, then good purposes, Ile practice how to exercise the worth Commended to us by our ancestors; The poore neglected souldier shall command Me from a Ladies Courtship, and the forme Ile study shall no more be taught me by The Taylor, but the Scholler; that expence Which hitherro has been to entertaine Th'intemperate pride and pleasure of the taste Shall fill my Table more to satisfie, And lesse to surfeit. What an honest worke it would be; when we finde A Virgin in her poverty, and youth Inclining to be tempted, to imploy As much perswasion, and as much expence To keep her upright as men use to do upon her falling. Dub. Tis charity that many mayds wil be unthankful for, And some will rather take it for a wrong, To buy 'em out of their inheritance, The thing that they were born to. Enter Longueville. Mont. Longueville thou bringst a cheerfull promise in thy face. There stands no pale report upon thy cheeke, To give me feare or knowledge of my losse, tis red and lively. How proceeds my suit? Long. That's with labour sir, a labour that to those of Hercules May adde another; or (at least) be cald A imitation of this burning shirt: For twas a paine of that unmercifull Perplexity, to shoulder through the throng Of people that attended your successe: My sweaty linnen fixt upon my skin, Still as they puld me, tooke that with it; 'twas A feare I should have left my flesh among 'em: Yet I was patient, for (me thought) the toyle Might be an emblem of the difficult And weary passage to get out of Law. And to make up the deare similitude, When I was forth seeking my handkircher To wipe my sweat off, I did finde a cause To make me sweat more, for my Purse was lost Among their finger. Dub. There twas rather found. Long. By them. Dub. I mean so. Mont. Well, I will restore Thy dammage to thee: how proceeds my suit? Lang. Like one at Brokers; I thinke forfeited. Your promising councell at the first Put strongly forward with a labour'd speed, And such a violence of pleading, that His fee in Sugar-candie scarce will make His throat a satisfaction for the hurt He did it, and he carried the whole cause Before him with so cleare a passage, that The people in the favour of your side Cried Montague, Montague: in the spight of him That cryed out silence, and began to laugh Your adversaries Advocate to scorn: Who like a cunning foot-man? set me forth With such a temperate easie kind of course To put him into exercise of strength, And follow'd his advantages so close, That when your hot mouthed pleader thought 'had wonne, Before he reacht it, he was out of breath, And then the other stript him. Mont. So all is lost. Long. But how I know not; for (me thought) I stood Confounded with the clamour of the Court, Like one embarqued upon a storm at Sea, Where the tempestuous noise of Thunder mixt With roaring of the billows, and the thick Imperfect language of the Sea-men, takes His understanding and his safety both Together from him. Mont. Thou dost bring ill news Long. Of what I was unwilling to have been The first reporter. Mont. Didst observe no more? Long. At least no better. Mont. Then th'art not inform'd So well as I am; I can tell thee that Will please thee, for when all else left my cause, My very adversaries tooke my part. Long. —whosoever told you that abused you. Mont. Credit me, he took my part When all forsook me. Long. Took it from you. Mont. Yes I meane so, and I think he had just cause To take it when the verdict gave it him. Dub. His Spirit would ha' sunke him, ere he could Have carried an ill fortune of this waight so lightly. Mont. Nothing is a misery unlesse our weaknesse apprehend it so; We cannot be more faithfull to our selves In any thing that's manly, then to make Ill fortune as contemptible to us As it makes us to others. Enter Lawyers. Long. Here come they Whose very countenances will tell you how Contemptible it is to others. Mont. Sir? Long. The sir of Knighthood may be given him, ere They heare you now. Mont. Good sir but a word. Dub. How soon the losse of wealth makes any man Grow out of knowledge. Long. Let me see I pray sir, Never stood you upon the pillory? 1 Law. The Pillory? Long. O now I know you did not. Y'ave eares, I thought ye had lost 'em; pray observe, Here's one that once was gracious in our eyes. 1 Law. O my Lord, have an eye upon him. Long. But ha' you nere a Counsell to redeeme His Land yet from the judgement? 2 Law. None but this, a writ of errour to remove the cause. Long. No more of errour, we have been in that too much already. 2 Law. If you will reverse the judgement, you must trust to that delay. Long. Delay? Indeed he's like to trust to that, With you has any dealing. 2 Law. Ere the Law proceeds to an habere facias possessionem. Dub. That's a language sir, I understand not. Long. Th'art a very strange unthankfull fellow to have taken Fees of such a liberall measure, and then give a man hard words for's money. 1 Law. If men will hazzard their salvations, What should I say? I've other businesse. Mont. Y'are ith' right; That's it you should say now prosperity has left me. Enter two Creditors. 1 Cred. Have an eye upon him; if We lose him now, he's gone for ever; stay And dog him: Ile goe fetch the officers. Long. Dog him you blood-hound: by this point thou shalt more safely dog an angry Lion then attempt him. Mont. What's the matter? Long. Doe but steere to fetch a Serjeant; and (besides your losse Of labour) Ile have you beaten, till Those casements in your faces be false lights. Dub. Falser then those you sell by. Mont. Who gave you Commission to abuse my friends thus? Lon. Sir, are those your friends that would betray you? Mont. Tis to save themselves rather then betray me. 1 Cred. Your Lordship makes a just construction of it. 2 Cred. All our desire is but to get our own. Long. Your wives desires and yours do differ then. Mont. So far as my ability will goe You shall have satisfaction Longeville, Long. And leave your selfe neglected; every man Is first a debtor to his own demands, being honest. Mont. As I take it sir, I did Not entertaine you for my counsellor. Long. Counsel's the office of a servant, When the master fals upon a danger: as Defence is never threaten with your eyes, They are no cockatrices; do you heare? Talke with a Girdler, or a Milner, He can informe you of a kind of men That first undid the profit of those trades By bringing up the forme of carrying There morglachs in their hands: with some of those A man may make himselfe a priviledge To aske a question at the prison gates, Without your good permission. 2 Cred. By your leave. Mont. Stay sir, what one example since the time That first you put your hat off to me, have You noted in me to encourage you To this presumption? by the justice now Of thine own rule, I should begin with thee, I should turn thee away ungratified For all thy former kindnesse, forget Thou ever didst me any service: tis not feare Of being arrested makes me thus incline To satisfie you; for you see by him, I lost not all defences with my state; The curses of a man to whom I am Beholding terrifie me more, then all The violence he can pursue me with. Duboys, I did prepare me for the worst; These two small Cabinets doe comprehend The sum of all the wealth that it hath pleased Adversity to leave me, one as rich As th'other, both in Jewels; take thou this, And as the Order put within it shall Direct thee, distribute it half between Those Creditors, and th'other halfe among My servants: for (sir) they are my creditors As well as you are, they have trusted me With their advancement: if the value faile, To please you all, my first increase of meanes Shall offer you a fuller payment; be content To leave me something, and imagine that You put a new beginner into credit. Cred. So prosper our own blessings, as we wish you to your merit. Mont. Are your silences of discontent, or of sorrow? Dub. Sir, we would not leave you. Long. Do but suffer us to follow you, and what our present means, or industries hereafter can provide, shall serve you. Mont. O desire me not to live To such a basenesse, as to be maintained By those that serve me; pray be gone, I wil Defend your honesties to any man That shal report you have forsaken me; I pray be gone. Exeunt Servants and Creditors. Why dost thou weep my boy, Because I doe not bid thee goe too? Ver. No, I weep (my Lord) because I would not goe; I feare you will command me. Mont. No my child, I wil not; that would discommend th'intent Of all my other actions: thou art yet Unable to advise thy selfe a course, Should I put thee to seeke it; after that I must excuse or at the least forgive Any uncharitable deed that can be done against my selfe. Uer. Every day (my Lord) I tarry with you, Ile account A day of blessing to me; for I shall Have so much lesse time left me of my life When I am from you: and if misery Befall you (which I hope so good a man Was never born to) I wil take my part, And make my willingnesse increase my strength To beare it. In the Winter I will spare Mine own clothes from my selfe to cover you; And in the Summer, carry some of yours To ease you: Ile doe any thing I can. Mont. Why, thou art able to make misery Ashamed of hurting, when thy weaknesse can Both beare it, and despise it: Come my boy I will provide some better way for thee Then this thou speakst of; tis the comfort that Ill fortune has undone me into the fashion: For now in this age most men do begin, To keep but one boy, that kept many men. Exeunt. Enter Orleans, a Servant, his Ladie following. Orl. Where is she? call her. Lady. I attend you sir. Orl. Your friend sweet Madam. Lady. What friend, good my Lord? Orl. Your Montague, Madam, he will shortly want Those Courtly graces that you love him for; The means wherewith he purchased this, and this, And all his own provisions to the least Proportion of his feeding or his clothes, Came out of that inheritance of land Which he unjustly lived on: but the law Has given me right in't, and possession; now Thou shalt perceive his bravery vanish, as This Jewell does from thee now, and these Pearles To him that owes 'em. Lady. Ye are the owner sir of every thing that does belong to me. Orl. No, not of him, sweet Lady. Lady. O good God! Orl. But in a while your mind will change, and be As ready to disclaime him; when his wants And miseries have perish'd his good face, And taken off the sweetnesse that has made Him pleasing in a womans understanding. La. O Heaven, how gratious had Creation been To women, who are borne without defence, If to our hearts there had been doores through which Or husbands might have lookt into our thoughts, And made themselves undoubtfull. Orl. Made 'em madde. La. With honest women. Orl. Thou dost stile pretend A title to that vertue: prethee let Thy honesty speak freelie to me now. Thou knowest that Montaigue of whose Land I am the master, did affect three first, And should have had thee, if the strength of friends Had not prevail'd above thine own consent. I have undone him, tell me how thou doest Consider his ill fortune and my good. La. Ile tell you justly his undoing is An argument for pitty? and for teares In all their dispositions that have known The honour and the goodnesse of his life: Yet that addition of prosperity, Which you have got by't, no indifferent man Will malice or repine at, if the Law Be not abused in't; howsoever since You have the upper fortune of him, 'twill Be some dishonour to you to beare your selfe With any pride or glory over him. Orl. This may be truly spoken, but in thee It is not honest. La. Yes, so honest, that I care not if the chast Penelope Were now alive to hear me. Enter Amiens. Orl. Who comes there? La. My brother. Am. Save yee. Orl. Now sir, you have heard of prosperous Montague. Am. No sir, I have heard of Montague, But of your prosperity. Orl. Is he distracted. Am. He does beare his losse with such a noble strength Of patience that, Had fortune eyes to see him, she would weepe For having hurt him, and pretending that Shee did it but for triall of his worth: Hereafter ever love him. Orl. I perceive you love him, and because (I must confesse) He does deserve that though for some respects, I have not given him that acknowledgement, Yet in mine honour I did still conclude to use him nobly. Am. Sir, that will become your reputation, and make me grow proud of your alliance. Orl. I did reserve the doing of this friendship till I had His fortunes at my mercy, that the world May tell him 'tis a willing courtesie. La. This change wil make me happy. Orl. Tis a change; thou shalt behold it, then observe me when That Montague had possession of my Land, I was his rivall, and at last obtain'd This Lady who by promise of her own Affection to him, should ha bin his wife; I had her, and withheld her like a pawne, Till now my Land is rendred to me againe, And since it is so, you shall see I have The conscience not to keep her—give him her— draws For by the faithfull temper of my sword, shee shall not tarry with me. Am. Give me way— draws. Thou most unworthy man—give me way Or by the wrong he does the Innocent, Ile end thy misery and his wickednesse, together. Lady. Stay and let me justifie My husband in that, I have wrong'd his bed Enter Amiens in amazement, the servants following him. Never—all shames that can afflict me fall Upon me if I ever wrong'd you; Orl. Didst thou not confesse it? La. Twas to save your bloud from shedding, that has Turn'd my brothers edge; He that beholdes our thoughts as plainely as Our faces, knowes it, I did never hurt My honesty but by accusing it. Orl. Womens consents are sonner credited Then their denials: and Ile never trust Her body that prefers any defence Before the safety of her honour—here— Enter servant Show forth that stranger—give me not a word Thou seest a danger readie to be tempted. La. Cast that upon me rather then my shame, And as I am now dying I wil now— That I am honest. Orl. Put her out of dores; but that I feare my land May go againe to Montague, I would kill thee, I am loth, To make a beggar of him that way; or else— Go now you have the liberty of flesh, And you may put it to a double use, One for your pleasure, th'other to maintaine Your welbeloved, he wil want. Exit Lady In such a charitable exercise The vertue wil excuse you for the vice. Exit Orleans. Enter Amiens drawne, Montague, Vereamor meeting. Mont. What meanes your Lordship? Ver. For the love of God— Am. Thou hast advantage of mee, cast away this buckler. Mont. So he is Sir, for he lives With one that is undone—a voyd us boy. Uer. Ile first avoid my safety, Your Rapier shall be button'd, with my heade before it touch my Master. Am. Montague? Mont. Sir. Am. You know my sister? Mont. Yes sir. Am. For a whore? Mont. You lye, and shall lie lower if you dare abuse her honor. Enter Lady. La. I am honest. Am. Honest! La. Upon my faith I am. Am. What did then perswade thee to condemn thy self? La. Your safety. Am. I had rather be expos'd To danger, then dishonor; th'ast betray'd The reputation of my familie More basely by the falsenesse of that word, Then that thou hast delivered me asleepe Into the hands of base enemie. Reliefe will never make thee sensible Of thy disgraces; let thy wants compell thee to it. Exit. La. I am a miserable woman. Mont. Why Madam? are you utterly without means to relieve you? La. I have nothing sir, unlesse by changing of these cloaths for worse, and then at last the worst for nakednesse. Mont. Stand off boy, nakednesse would be a change To please us Madam, to delight us both. La. What nakednesse sir? Mont. Why the nakednesse of body Madam, we were Lovers once. La. Never dishonest Lovers. Mont. Honestie has no allowance now to give our selves. La. Nor you allowance against honestie. Mont. Ile send my Boy hence, opportunitie Shall be our servant, come and meet me first With kisses like a stranger at the doore, And then invite me neerer to receive A more familiar inward welcome—where, Instead of tapers made of Virgins wax Th'increasing flames of our desires shall light Us to a banquet: and before the taste Be dull with satisfaction, Ile prepare A nourishment compos'd of every thing That beares a naturall friendship to the bloud, And that shall set another edge upon't, Or else between the courses of the feast Wee'l dallie out an exercise of time, That ever as one appetite expires another may succeede it. La. O my Lord, how has your nature lost her worthinesse? When our affections had their liberty, Or kisses met as temperatelie as The hands of sisters, or of brothers, that Our blouds were then as moving; then you were So noble, that I durst have trusted your Embraces in an opportunity Silent enough to serve a ravisher, And yet come from you—undishonor'd—how You think me altered, that you promise your Attempt successe I know not; but were all The sweet temptations that deceive us set On this side, and one that side all the waiters, These neither should perswade me nor the force. Mont. Then misery may waste your body. Lady. Yes, but lust shall never. Mont. I have found you still as uncorrupted as I left you first Continue so; and I wil serve you with As much devotion as my word, my hand Or purse can show you; and to justifie That promise, here is half the wealth I have, Take it, you owe me nothing, till you fall From vertue, which the better to protect I have bethought me of a present meanes Give me the Letter; this commends my Boy Into the service of a Lady, whose Free goodnesse you have bin acquainted with Lamira. Lady. Sir I know her. Mont. Then believe her entertainment wil be noble to you; My boy shall bring you thither: and relate Your manner of misfortune if your own Report needs any witnesse: so I kisse your hand good Lady. Lady. Sir, I know not how to promise, but I cannot be unthankfull. Mont. All that you can implore in thankfulnesse Be yours, to make you the more prosperous. Farwell my boy,—I am not yet oppress'd. Exit Lady Uera. Having the power to helpe one that's distress'd. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundi Scæna Prima. Enter Longaville and Dubois Long. What shall we do now: swords are out of use, And words are out of credit. Dub. We must serve. Long. The meanes to get a service will first spend Our purses; and except we can allow Our selves an entertainment, service will Neglect us; now tis grown into a doubt Whether the Mr. or the servant gives the countenance. Dub. Then fall in with Mistresses. Long. They keep more servants now (indeed) then men, But yet the age is grown so populous Of those attendants, that the women are Grown full to. Dub. What shall we propund our selves? Long. I'le think on't. Dub. Do; Old occupations have too many setters up to prosper, some uncommon trade would thrive now. Long. Wee'l ee'n make up some half a dozen proper men, And should not we get more Then all your female sinners? Dub. If the house be seated as it should be privately. Long. I but that would make a multitude of witches. Dub. VVitches? how prethee? Long. Thus the bauds would all turn witches to revenge Themselves upon; us and the women that Come to us, for disguises must wear beards, And that's they say, a token of a witch. Dub. VVhat shall we then do. Long. VVe must study on't, VVith more consideration; stay Duboyes Are not the Lord of Orleans and the Lord Of Amiens enemies? Dub. Yes, what of that. Long. Methinks the factions of two such great men. Should give a promise of advancement now To us that want it. Dub. Let the plot be thine, and in the enterprize Ile second thee. Long. I have it, wee will first set down our selves The Method of a quarrell; and make choyce Of some frequented Taverne; or such a place Of common notice to perform it in By way of undertaking to maintaine The severall honours of those enemies. Thou for the Lord of Orleanes; I for Amiens. Dub. I like the project, and I think 'twill take The better, since their difference first did rise From his occasion whom we followed once. Long. We cannot hope lesse after the report, Then entertainment or gratuity, Yet those are ends, I do not aime at most; Greater spirits that are needy, and will thrive, Must labour whiles such troubles are alive. Exeunt. Enter Laverdine, and La-poope. La p. Slander is sharper then the sword. I have fed this three dayes upon leafe Tobacco, for want of other Victuals. Lav. You have liv'd the honester Captaine; but be not so dejected, but hold up thy head, and meate wil sooner fall i'thy mouth. La-p. I care not so much for meat, so I had but good liquor, for which my guts croak like so many Frogs for raine. Lav. It seemes, you are troubled with the wind-Collick Captaine, swallow a bullet: tis present remedy i'le assure you. La-p. A bullet; if you be Captain, my panch is nothing but a pile of bullets; when I was in any service I stood between my Generall and the shot, like a mud-wall; I am all lead, from the crown of the head to the soale of the foot, not a sound bone about me. Lav. It seems you have bin in terrible hot service Captaine. La-p. It has ever bin the fate of the low Country wars to spoile many a man, I ha' not bin the first nor shall not be the last: but ile tell you sir, (hunger has brought it in to minde) I served once at the Siege of Braste 'tis memorable to this day, where we were in great distresse for victuals, whole troops fainted more for want of food then for blood, and died, yet we were resolved to stand it out; I my self was but then Gentleman of a Company, and had as much need as any man, and indeed I had perished had not a miraculous providence preserved me. Lav. As how good Captaine? La-p. Marry sir ee'n as I was fainting and falling down for want of sustenance, the enemy made a shot at me, and struck me full ith' paunch with a penny loaf. Lav. Instead of a bullet! La. p. In stead of a bullet. Lav. That was miraculous in deed; and that loaf sustained you. Lap-p. Nourished me or I had famished with the rest. Lav. You have done worthy acts being a souldier, and now you shall give me leave to requite your tale, and to acquaint you with the most notorious deeds that I have done being a Courtier. I protest Captain I wil lie no more then you have done. La-p. I can indure no lies. Lav. I know you cannot Captaine, therefore ile only tell you of strange things, I did once a deed of charity for it self; I assisted a poor widdow in a sute, and obtained it, yet I protest I took not a penny for my labour. La-p. Tis no such strange thing. Lav. By Mars Captaine, but it is, and a very strange thing too in a Courtier, it may take the upper hand of your penny loaf for a miracle. I could ha' told you how many Ladies have languished for my love, and how I was once sollicited by the mother, the daughter, and grand-mother out of the least of which I might have digg'd my selfe a fortune; they were all great Ladies, for two of them were so big I could hardly embrace them: but I was sluggish in my rising courses, and therefore let them passe; what meanes I had is spent upon such as had the wit to cheat me; That wealth being gon, I have only bought experience with it, with a strong hope to cheat others, but see here comes the much declined Montague, who had all the Manor houses, which were the body of his estate overthrowen by a great winde. Enter Montague, Mallicorne. La-p. How by a great winde? was he not overthrown by law? Lav. Yes, marry was he: but there was terrible puffing and blowing before he was overthrown, if you observ'd, and believe it Captain, ther's no wind so dangerous to a building as a lawyers breath. La-p. What's he with him? Lav. An eminent Citizen. Mounsier Mallicorne, lets stand a side and listen their design. Mal. Sir, profit is the Crown of labour, it is the life, the soule of the industrious Merchant, in it he makes his paradise, and for it neglects Wife, Children, Friends, Parents, nay all the world, and delivers up himselfe to the violence of stormes, and to be tos'd into unknown ayres; as there is no faculty so perillous, so ther's none so worthy profitable. Mont. Sir, I am very well possest of it, and what of my poore fortunes remaines, I would gladly hazzard upon the Sea; it cannot deale worse with me then the Land, though it sinck or throw it in the hands of Pirats. I have yet five hundred pounds left, and your honest and worthy acquaintance may make me a young Merchant; th'one moity of what I have I would gladly adventure. Mal. How adventure? you shall hazzard nothing: you shall only joyne with me in certaine commodities that are safe arrived unto the Key; you shall neither be in doubt of danger nor dammage; But so much mony disburst, so much receive; sir I would have you conceive I pursue it not for any good your money wil do me, but meerly out of mine own freenesse and courtesie to pleasure you. Mont. I can believe no lesse, and you expresse a noble nature, seeking to build up a man so ruin'd as my selfe. Lav. Captaine here is subject for us to worke upon if we have wit; you hear that there is money yet left, and it is going to be layd out in Rattels, Bels, Hobby-Horses, brown paper, or some such like sale commodities; now it would do better in our purses, upon our backs in good Gold-lace, and Scarlet, and then we might pursue our projects, and our devices towards my Lady Annabella; go to, ther's a conceit newly landed; harck I stand in good reputation with him, and therefore may the better cheat him: Captaine, take a few instructions from me. Mont. What monies I have is at your disposing, and upon twelve I will meete you at the Pallace with it. Mal. I wil there expect you, and so I take my leave. Exit. Lav. You apprehend me? La-p. Why do ye think I am a dunce? Lav. Not a dunce Captaine, but you might give me leave to misdoubt that pregnancy in a Souldier, which is proper and hereditary to a Courtier; but prosequute it, I wil both second, and give credit to it. Good Mounsier Montague, I would your whole revenues lay within the circuit of mine armes, that I might as easily bestow, or restore it unto you as my curtesie. La-p. My zealous wishes sir, do accompany his for your good fortunes. Lav. Believe it sir, our affection towards you is a strong band of friendship. Mont. To which I shall most willingly seale. But believe me Gentlemen in a broken estate, the bond of friendship oft is forfeited, but that it is your free and ingenuous nature to renew it. Lav. Sir, I wil amply extend my self to your use, and am very zealously afflicted as not one of your least friends for your croocked fate; But let it seise you with any dejection, you have as I hear a sufficient competency left, which wel disposed may erect you as high in the worlds account as ever. Mont. I cannot live to hope it, much lesse injoy it, nor is it any part of my endeavour; my study is to render every man his own, and to containe my self within the limits of a Gentleman. Lav. I have the grant of an Office given me by some noble favorites of mine in Court, there stands but a small matter between me and it, if your ability be such to lay down the present sum, out of the love I bear you, before any other man, it shall be confirmed yours. Mont. I have heard you often speak of such a thing; if it be assur'd to you I wil gladly deale in it that portion I have, I would not hazard upon one course, for I see the most certainest is incertain. La-p. Having money sir, you could not light upon men that could give better direction; there is at this time a friend of mine upon the Seas; to be plain with you, he is a Pyrate, that hath wrote to me to work his fredom, and by this Gentlemans meanes, whose acquaintance is not small at Court; we have the word of a worthy man for it, only there is some money to be suddainly disburst, and if your happinesse be such to make it up you shall receive treble gaine by it, and good assurance for it. Mont. Gentlemen out of the weaknesse of my estate you seem (to have some knowledge of my brest) that wood if it were possible advance my declined fortunes, to satisfie all men of whom I have had credit, and I know no way better then these which you propose; I have some money ready under my command, some part of it is already promis'd, but the remainder is yours to such uses as are propounded. Lav. Appoint some certain place of meeting, for these affaires requires expedition. Mont. I wil make it my present businesse: at twelve, I am to meet Mallicorne the Marchant at the Pallace, you know him sir, about some negotiation of the same nature, there I wil be ready to tender you that money, upon such conditions as wee shall conclude off. Lav. The care of it be yours, so much as they affaire concernes you. Mont. Your caution is effectuall, and till then I take my leave. Lav. Good Mr. Montague. Exit. Whithin a clamor, down with their weapons. Enter Longavile and Dubois, their swords drawn, servants and others between them. Ser. Nay Gentlemen what meane you pray be quiet, have some respect unto the house. Long. A treacherous slave. Du. Thou dost revile thy self base Longavile. Long. I say thou art a villaine and a corrupt one, that hast some seaven years fed on thy masters trencher, yet never bredst good bloud towards him: for if, thou hadst have a sounder heart. Du. So sir, you can use your tongue something nimbler then your sword. Long. Wood you cood use your tongue well of your Master, friend you might have better imployment for your sword. Du. I say againe and I wil speak it loud and often, that Orleans is a noble Gentleman with whom Amiens is to light to poyse the scale. Long. He is the weaker for taking of a prayse out of thy mouth. Du. This hand shall seale his merit at thy heart. Lav. Part them my masters part them. Ser. Part them sir, why do you not part them, you stand by with your sword in your hand, and cry part 'em. Lav. Why you must know my friend my cloaths are better then yours, and in a good suit, I do never use to part any body. La-p. And it is discretion. Lav. I marry is it Captaine. Long. Duboies though this place priviledge thee, know where next we meet, the bloud which at thy heart flowes drops at thy feet. Enter Amience in hast, his sword drawne. Du. I would not spend it better then in this quarrell, and on such a hazard. Ami. What uprores this, must my name here be question'd in Tavern brawels, and by affected Ruffins? Lav. Not we indeed sir. Du. Fear cannot make me shrink out of your fury, though you were greater then your name doth make you, I am one, and the opposer, if your swoln rage have ought in mallice to inforce expresse it. Ami. I seek thee not nor shalt thou ever gaine That credit, which a blow from me wood give thee, By my—I more detest that fellow Which took my part then thee, that he durst offer To take my honour in his feeble armes, And spend it in a drinking room; which way went he? Lav. That way sir, I wood you wood after for I do fear we shall have some more scuffling. Ami. Ile follow him, and if my speed o're take him, I shall ill thank him for his forwardnesse. Exit. Lav. I am glad he's gon, for I do not love to see a sword drawn in the hand of a man that lookes so furious, ther's no jesting with edge tooles, how say you Captaine? Cap. I Say tis better jesting then to be in earnest with them. Enter Orleance. Orl. How now? what's the difference? they say there have bin swords drawn, and in my quarrell, let me know that man, whose love is so sincere to spend his bloud for my sake, I will bounteously requite him. Lav. We were all of your side, but there he stands begun it. Orl. What's thy name? Dub. Duboyes? Orl. Give me thy hand, thou hast receaved no hurt? Dub. Not any, nor wear this body stuck full of wounds, I should not count them hurts, being taken in so honorable a cause as the defence of my most worthy Lord. Orl. The dedication of thy love to me requires my ample bounty, thou art mine, for I do finde thee made unto my purposes. Mounsieur Laverdine, pardon my neglect I not observed you, and how runs rumour. Lav. Why, it runs my Lord like a foot man without a cloak, to show that what's once rumour'd it cannot be hidde. Orl. And what say the rable, am not I the subject of their talk? Lav. Troth my Lord the common mouth speakes foule words. Orl. Of me, for turning away my wife do they not? Lav. Faith the men do a little murmer at it and say, 'tis an ill president in so great a man, marry the women they rayle, out right. Orl. Out upon them rampallions Ile keepe my selfe safe enough out of their fingers, but what say my prity Jelly composed gallant that censure every thing more desperate then it is dangerous; what say they? Lav. Marry they are laying wagers, what death you shall die; one offers to lay five hundred pounds; And yet he had but a groat about him, &amp; that was in two two-pences too to any man that wo'd make it up a shilling; that you were kil'd with a Pistoll charg'd with white Powder; another offerd to pawne his soule for five shillings, and yet no body wo'd take him, that you were stab'd to death and sho'd die with more wounds then Cesar. Orl. And who sho'd be the Butchers that sho'd do it? Montague and his associates? Lav. So tis conjectured. La-p. And believe it, sweet Prince, it is to be feared, and therefore prevented. Orl. By turning his purpose on himself, were not that the way? Lav. The most direct path for your safety. For where doth danger sit more furious then in a desperate man? La-p. And being you have declined his meanes, you have increast his malice. Lav. Besides the generall report that steems in every mans breath, and staines you all over with infamy, that Time the devourer of all things cannot eat out. La-p. I, for that former familiarity, which he had with your Lady. Lav. Men speak it as boldly as words of complement; good morrow, good even, or God save you sir, are not more usuall; if the word cuckold had been written upon your forehead in great Capitall Letters, it could not have been dilated with more confidence. Orl. He shall not sleepe another night, I will have his blood, though it be required at my hands again. Lav. Your Lordship may, and without hazzarding your own person; he's a Gentleman in whose looks I see a resolution to perform it. Dub. Let his Lordship give me but his honourable word for my life, Ile kill him as he walks. Lav. Or pistoll him as he sits at meat. La-p. Or at game. Lav. Or as he is drinking. Dub. Any way. Orl. Wot thou? call what is mine thine own, thy reputation shall not be brought in question for it, muchlesse thy life; it shall be namd a deed of valour in thee, not murder: Farewell. Exit. Dub. I need no more encouragement, it is a worke I, will perswade my selfe that I was borne to. Laver. And you may perswade your selfe to that you shall be sav'd by it, being that it is for his honourable Lordship. Dub. But you must yield me means, how, when and where. Lav. That shall be our taskes; Nay more, we will be agents with thee: This houre we are to meet him, on the receipt of certain moneys, Which indeed we purpose honestly to cheat him of, And that's the many causes I wo'd have him slain, Who works with safety makes a double gain. Exeunt. Enter Longaville, Amiens following him. Ami. Stay sir, I have took some pains to overtake you. —Your name is Longaville? Long. I have the word of many honest men for't, I crave your Lordships pardon, your sudden apprehension on my steps made me to frame an answer unwitting and unworthy your respect. Ami. Doe you know me? Long. Yes, my Lord. Ami. I know not you; nor am I well pleased to make this time, as the affaire now stands, the induction of your acquaintance; you are a fighting fellow? Long. How my Lord? Ami. I thinke I too much grace you; rather you are a fellow dares not fight, but spet and puffe and make a noyse whilst your trembling hand drawes out your Sword, to lay it upon Andirons, stooles or tables, rather then on a man. Long. Your honour may best speake this yet— with little safety, if I thought it serious. Ami. Come, you are a merry braggart, and you have given me cause to tell you so: what weaknesse have you ever seen in me to prompt your selfe, that I could need your helpe, or what other reasons could induce you to it? you never yet had a meales meat from my Table, nor as I remember from my Wardrop any cast Suite. Lon. Tis true, I never durst yet have such a servile spirit, to be the minion of a full swolne Lord; but alwaies did detest such slavery: a meales meat, or a cast sute? I wo'd first eate the stones, and from such rags the dunghils does afford pick me a garment. Ami. I have mistook the man, his resolute spirit Proclaimes him generous, he has a noble heart As free to utter good deeds as to act them; For had he not been right, and of one piece, He would have crumpled, curled, and struck himselfe Out of the shape of man into a shaddow. But prethee tell me, if no such fawning hope Did lead thee on to hazzard life for my sake; What was it that incited thee? Tell me; speak it without the imputation of a Sicophant. Long. Your own desert, and with it was joyn'd the unfained friendship that I judged you ever held unto my former Lord. Ami. The noble Montague? Long. Yes, the noble and much injured Montague. Ami. To such a man as thou art, my heart shall be A Casket: I will lock thee up there, And esteem thee as a faithfull friend, The richest Jewell that a man enjoyes; And being thou didst follow once my friend, And in thy heart still dost, not with his fortunes casting him off, Thou shalt goe hand in hand with me, and share As well in my ability as love; tis not my end To gaine men for my use, but a true friend. Exeunt. Enter Duboys. Dub. There's no such thriving way to live in grace, As to have no sence of it; his backe nor belly Shall not want warming that can practise me mischiefe; I walke now with a full purse, grow high and wanton, Prune and briske my selfe in the bright shine Of his good Lordships favours; and for what vertue? For fashioning my selfe a murderer. O noble Montague, to whom I owe my heart, With all my best thoughts, tho my tongue have promisd To exceed the malice of thy destiny, Never in time of all my service knew I Such a sinne tempt thy bounty; those that did feed Upon thy charge had merit or else need. Enter Laverdine and Lapoope, with disguises. Lav. Duboys, most prosperously met. Dub. How now? will he come this way. Lav. This way, immediately; therefore thy assistance, deere Duboys. Dub. What have you cheated him of the money you spoke of? Lav. Fough, as easily as a silly Countrey wench of her maydenhead; we had it in a twinkling. Dub. Tis well Captaine, let me helpe you, you must be our leader in this action. La-p. Tut, feare not, Ile warrant you if my Sword hold, we'l make no sweating sicknesse of it. Dub. Why that's well said, but let's retire a little, that we may come on the more bravely; this way, this way. Exeunt. Enter Montague in the hands of three Officers, and three Creditors. 1 Cre. Officers look to him, and be sure you take good security before he part from you. Mont. Why but my friends, you take a strange course with me; the sums I owe you are rather forgetfulnesse they are so slight, then want of will or honesty to pay you. 1 Cred. I sir, it may be so; but we must be paid, and we will be paid before you scape: we have wife and children, and a charge, and you are going down the wind, as a man may say; and therefore it behooves us to looke to't in time. 2 Cred. Your cloak here wo'd satisfie me, mine's not above a three pound matter, besides the arrest. 3 Cred. Faith and mine is much about that matter too; your Girdle and Hangers, and your Beaver, shall be sufficient baile for't. 1 Cred. If you have ever a plain black sute at home, this Silken one, with your Silke-stockings, Garters, and Roses shall pacifie me too; for I take no delight, if I have a sufficient pawne, to cast any Gentleman in prison; therefore tis but an untrusting matter, and you are free, we are no unreasonable creatures you see; for mine own part, I protest I am loth to put you to any trouble for security. Mont. Is there no more of you? he wo'd next demand my skinne. 1 Cred. No sir, here's no more of us, nor do any of us demand your skin, we know not what to doe with it: but it may be if you ow'd your Glover any money, he knew what use to make of it. Mont. Ye dregs of basenesse, vultures amongst men, That tyer upon the hearts of generous spirits. 1 Cred. You doe us wrong sir, we tyre no generous spirits, we tyre nothing but our hackneys. Enter Mallicorne. Mont. But here comes one made of another piece; A man well meriting that free born name Of Citizen; welcome my deliverer, I am falne Into the hands of blood-hounds, that for a sum Lesser then their honesties, which is nothing, Wo'd teare me out of my skin. Mal. Why sir, what's the matter? 1 Cre. Why sir, the matter is, that we must have our money, which if we cannot have, we'l satisfie our selves with his carcasse, and be payd that waies: you had as good sir not have been so peremptory. Officer, hold fast. 1 Offi. The strenuous fist of vengeance now is clutcht; therefore feare nothing. Mal. What may be the debt in grosse? Mont. Some forty Crowns, nay rather not so much, tis quickly cast. Mal. Tis strange to me, that your estate sho'd have so low an ebbe, to sticke at such sleight sums: why my friends, you are too strict in your accounts, and call too sudden on this Gentleman, he has hopes left yet to pay you all. 1 Cred. Hopes? I marry bid him pay his friends with hopes, and pay us with currant Coyne: I knew a gallant once that fed his creditors still with hopes, and bid 'em they sho'd feare nothing, for he had 'em tyed in a string; and trust me so he had indeed, for at last he and all his hopes hopt in a haltar. Mont. Good sir, with what speed you may free out the company of these slaves, that have nothing but their names to show 'em men. Mal. What wo'd you wish me do sir? I protest I ha' not the present summe (small as it is) to lay down for you; and for giving my word, my friends no latter then yesternight made me take bread and eate it, that I sho'd not do it for any man breathing ith' world; therefore I pray hold me excused. Mont. You doe not speake this seriously? Mal. As ever I said my prayers, I protest to you. Mont. What may I think of this? Mal. Troth sir thought is free for any man; we abuse our betters in it, I have done it my selfe. Mont. Trust me, this speech of yours doth much amaze me, pray leave this language, and out of that same sum you lately did receive of me, lay down as much as may discharge me. Mal. You are a merry man sir, and I am glad you take your crosses so temperately; fare you well sir, and yet I have something more to say to ye, a word in your eare I pray; to be plaine with you I did lay this plot to arrest you to enjoy this money I have of yours, with the more safety. I am a foole to tell you this now; but in good faith I could not keepe it in. And the money wo'd a done me little good else. An honest Citizen cannot wholly enjoy his own wife for you, they grow old before they have true use of them, which is a lamentable thing, and truely much hardens the hearts of us Citizens against you: I can say no more, but am heartily sorry for your heavinesse, and so I take my leave. Exit Mallycorne. 1 Cred. Officers take hold on him againe, for Mounsier Mallycorne will doe nothing for him I perceive. Enter Duboys, Lapoope, and Laverdine. Dub. Nay come my masters, leave dauncing of the old measures, and let's assault him bravely. Lav. By no means; for it goes against my stomacke to kill a man in an unjust quarrell. La-p. It must needs be a clog to a mans conscience all his life time. Lav. It must indeed Captaine: besides doe ye not see he has gotten a guard of friends about him, as if he had some knowledge of our purpose? Dub. Had he a guard of Devils as I think them little better, my Sword should doe the message that it came for. Lav. If you will be so desperate, the blood lie upon your own neck, for we'l not meddle in't. Duboys runs upon Montague, and strugling yeelds him his Sword; the Officers draw, Laverdine and La-poope in the scuffling retire, Montague chaseth them off the Stage, himselfe wounded. Dub. I am your friend and servant, Struggle with me and take my Sword; Noble sir make your way, you have slaine an Officer. Mont. Some one of them has certainly Requited me, for I do lose much blood. 1 Offic. Udsprecious, we have lost a brother, pursue the Gentleman. 2 Offic. Ile not meddle with him: you see what comes on't; besides I know he will be hang'd ere he be taken. 1 Offic. I tell thee yeoman he must be taken ere he be hanged; he is hurt in the guts, run afore therefore and know how his wife will rate his Sawsiges a pound. 3 Offic. Stay brother, I may live, for surely I finde i'm but hurt in the leg a dangerous kick on the shin-bone. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Scæna prima. Enter Madam Lamira, Madam le Orleans, Veramour. Lam. You see Lady What harmlesse sports ous Countrey life affords; And though you meet not here with City dainties, Or Courtly entertainment, what you have Is free and hearty. L. Orl. Madam, I finde here What is a stranger to the Court, content, And receive curtesies done for themselves, Without an expectation of returne, Which binds me to your service. Lam. Oh your love; My homely house built more for use then shew Observes the Golden mean equally distant From glittering pompe, and sordid avarice; For Maskes we will observe the workes of nature And in the place of visitation read. Our Physick shall be wholsome walkes, our viandes, Nourishing not provoking: for I finde Pleasures are tortures, that leave stings behind. L. Orl. You have a great estate. Lam. A competency Sufficient to maintaine me and my ranke, Nor am I, I thank Heaven, so Courtly bred As to imploy the utmost of my Rents In paying Tailors for phantastick Roabes; Or rather then be second in the fashion, Eate out my Officers and my Revenues With grating usury; my back shall not Be the base on which your soothing Citizen Erects his Summer-houses; nor on the other side Will I be so penuriously wise, As to make money (thats my slave) my Idoll, Which yet to wrong, merits as much reproof, As to abuse our servant. L. Orl. Yet with your pardon I thinke you want the Crown of all contentment. Lam. In what good Madam? L. Orl. In a worthy husband. Lam. —It is strange the galley-slave should praise His Oare, or stroakes; or you, that have made shipwracke Of all delight upon this Rock cal'd marriage, Should sing Encomions o't. L. Orl. Madam, though one fall From his horse and breake his neck, will you Conclude from that it is unfit to ride? Or must it follow, because Orleance My Lord's pleased to make his passionate triall Of my suspected patience, that my brother, (Were he not so, I might say, worthy Amiens) Will imitate his ills, that cannot fancy What's truely Noble in him? Lam. I must grant There's as much worth in him as can be lookt for From a young Lord, but not enough to make Me change my golden liberty and consent To be a servant to it, as wives are To the Imperious humors of their Lords: Me thinks I'm well, I rise and goe to bed When I thinke fit, eate what my appetite Desires without controle, my servants study Is my contentment, and to make me merry Their farthest ayms; my sleeps are enquired after, My rising up saluted with respect: Command and liberty now waite upon My Virgin state; what would I more? change all, And for a husband? no; these freedomes die, In which they live with my Virginity; Tis in their choice that's rich to be a wife, But not being yoakt to chuse the single life. Ver. Madam. Lam. How like you the Countrey? Uer. I like the ayre of it well Madam, and the rather because as on Irish Timber your Spiders will not make his web, so for ought I see yet your Cheater, Pander, and Informer being in their dispositions too foggy for this piercing climate, shun it, and choose rather to walk in mists in the City. Lam. Who did you serve first boy? Ver. A rich Merchants widdow, and was by her preferred to a young Court-lady. L. Orl. And what difference found you in their service? Uer. Very much: for looke how much my old City Madam gave to her-young visitants, so much my Lady received for her hoary Court-servants. Lam. And what made you to leave her? Ver. My father (Madam) had a desire to have me a taleman, took me from thence. Lam. Well, I perceive you inherit the wag, from your father. Ver. Doves beget Doves; and Eagles, Eagles, Madam: A Citizen here, tho left never so rich, seldome at the best proves a Gentleman: the sonne of an Advocate, tho dub'd like his father, will shew a relish of his discent, and the fathers thriving practice, as I have heard: she that of a Chambermayd is metamorphosed into a Madam, will yet remember how oft her daughter by her mother ventured to lie upon the rushes before she could get in that which makes many Ladies. L. Orl. But what think you of your late Master? Ver. Oh Madam— Sigh. Lam. Why doe you sigh? you are sorry that you left him, He made a wanton of you. Ver. Not for that: Or if he did, for that my youth must love him. Oh pardon me, if I say liberty Is bondage, if compared with his kind service; And but to have power now to speake his worth To its desert; I should be well content To be an old man when his praise were ended: And yet, if at this instant you were pleased, I should begin, the livery of age Would take his lodging upon this head Ere I should bring it to a period. In briefe he is a man (for God forbid That I should ever live to say he was Of such a shape as would make one beloved, That never had good thought;) and to his body He hath a mind of such a constant temper In which vertues throng to have a room: Yet 'gainst this noble Gentleman, this Montague, For in that name I comprehend all goodnesse, Wrong, and the wrested law, false witnesses, And envy sent from hell, have rose in Armes, And tho not pierced, battered his honourd shield. What shall I say? I hope you will forgive me, That if you were but pleas'd to love, I know no Juno worthy such a Jove. Enter Charlot with a letter. Lam. Tis well yet that I have the second place In your affection: From whence? Charl. From the Lord Amiens, Madam. Lam. Tis welcome, though it beare his usual language: I thought so much, his love-suit speake his health. What's he that brought it? Charl. A Gentleman of good ranke, it seems. Lam. Where is he? Charl. Receiving entertainment in your house Sorting with his degree. Lam. Tis well. Charl. He waites your Ladiships pleasure. Lam. He shall not waite long: Ile leave you for a while; nay stay you boy, Attend the Lady. Exeunt Lam. Charl. Vir. Would I might live once To waite on my poore Master. L. Orl. That's a good boy: This thankfulnesse looks lovely on thy forehead, And in it, as a book, me thinks I read Instructions for my selfe, that am his debtor, And wo'd do much that I might be so happy To repaire that which to our griefe is ruin'd. Vir. It were a worke a King might glory in, If he saw with my eyes: If you please Madam, For sure to me you seem to me unapt to walke, To sit, although the churlish Birds deny To give us musicke in this grove, where they Are prodigall to others: Ile strain my voyce For a sad Song, the place is safe and private. L. Orl. Twas my desire; begin good Viramour. Musick a Song, at the end of it enter Montague fainting, his Sword drawn. L. Orl. What's he Viramour? Vir. A goodly personage. Mont. Am I yet safe? or is my flight a dream? My wounds and hunger tell me that I wake: Whither have my feares borne me? no matter where, Who hath no place to goe to, cannot erre: What shall I doe? cunning calamity That others grosse wits uses to refine, When I most need it duls the edge of mine. L. Orl. Is not this Montagues voyce? Vir. My Masters? fie. Mont. What sound was that, pish, Feare makes the wretch think every leafe oth' Jury: What course to live, beg? better men have done it, But in another kind: steale? Alexander Though stiled a Conquerour, was a proud thiefe Though he robd with an Army; fie how idle These meditations are: though thou art worse Then sorrows tongue can speak thee, thou art still Or shouldst be, honest Montague. L. Orl. Tis too true. Vir. Tis he: what villaines hands did this? oh that my flesh Were Balme; in faith sir, I would plucke it off As readily as this; pray you accept My will to doe you service: I have heard The Mouse once sav'd the Lyon in his need, As the poore Scarab spild the Eagles seed. L. Orl. How do you? Mont. As a forsaken man. L. Orl. Do not say so, take comfort, For your misfortunes have been kind in this, To cast you on a hospitable shoare, Where dwels a Lady— Vir. She to whom, good Master, You prefer'd me. L. Orl. In whose house, whatsoere Your dangers are, Ile undertake your safety. Mont. I feare that I am pursued, and doubt that I In my defence have kild an Officer. Uir. Is that all? there's no law under the Sunne But will I hope confesse, one drop of blood Shed from this arme is recompence enough Though you had cut the throats of all the Catchpoles In France, nay in the world. Mont. I would be loth To be a burthen, or feed like a drone On the industrious labour of a Bee, And baser far I hold it to owe for The bread I eate, what's not in me to pay; Then since my full fortunes are declined, To their low ebb Ile fashion my high mind. It was no shame to Hecuba to serve When Troy was fired: ift be in your power To be a means to make her entertainment, And far from that I was; but to supply My want with habit fit for him that serves, I shall owe much to you. L. Orl. Leave that care to me. Vir. Good sir, leane on my shoulder; helpe good Madam: oh that I were a horse for halfe an houre, that I might carry you home on my backe: I hope you wil love me still? Mont. Thou dost deserve it boy, that I should live To be thus troublesome. L. Orl. Good sir, tis none. Vir. Trouble most willingly; I would be changd Like Apuleius, weare his Asses eares, Provided I might still this burthen beare. L. Orl. Tis a kind boy. Mont. I finde true proofe of it. Exeunt. Enter Amiens and Longeville with a Paper. Ami. You'l carry it. Long. As I live although my packet were like Bellerophons, what have you seen in me or my behaviour since your favours so plentifully showed upon my wants, that may beget distrust of my performance? Ami. Nay, be not angry, if I entertained But the least scruple of your love, or courage, I would make of one which my state Should do me right in this, nor can you blame me If in a matter of such consequence I am so importunate. Long. Good my Lord tell me, prevent your further conjurations To rayse my spirit, I know this is a challenge To be delivered unto Orleance hand, And that my undertaking ends not there, But I must be your second, and in that Not alone search your enemy, measure weapons, But stand in all your hazzards, as our blouds Ran in the self same veines, in which if I Better not your opinion, as a limbe That's putrifyed and uselesse, cut me off, And underneath the Gallous bury it. Ami. At full you understand me, and in this Binde me and what's mine to you and yours, I wil not so much wrong you as to adde One sylable more, let it suffice I leave My honor to your guard: and in that prove You hold the first place in my heart and love. Exit Ami. Long. The first place in a Lords affection? very good; and how long doth that last? perhaps the changing of some three shirts in the Tennis Court; wel it were very necessary that an order were taken (if it were possible,) that younger brother, might have more wit, or more money: for now how ever the foole hath long bin put upon him that inherits his revenew hath brought him a spunge, and wip't off the imputation, and for the understanding of the younger, let him get as much rhetorick as he can to grace his language. Enter Dubois. They wil see he shall have glosse little enough to set out his barck; stand Dubois look about all safe. Dub. Approach not neer me but with reverence Lawrell and adorations, I have done more then deserve a 100 thanks. Long. How now what's the matter? Dub. With this hand only aided by this brain, Without an Orpheus Harp redeem'd from hels Three headed Porter, our Euridice. Long. Nay prithee speak sence, this is like the stale braggart in a Play. Dub. Then in plaine Prose thus, and with as little action as thou canst desire, the three headed Porter, were three unexorable Catch-poles out of whose jawes with out the help of Orpheus Harp, baite or bribe, for those too stringes, makes the Musique that mollifies those flinty furies, I rescued our Euridice, I meane my old Master Montague. Long. And is this all, a poor rescue, I thought thou hadst reverst the judgement for his overthrow, in his sute, or wrought upon his adversary Orleance, taken the shape of a Ghost, frighted his mind into distraction, and for the appeasing of his conscience forc'd him to make restitution of Montagues Lands, or such like rescued; slight I would have hired Crohieture for two Cardekues to have done so much with his whip. Dub. You wood sir, and yet tis more then three on their foot-cloathes durst do for a sworne Brother, in a Coach. Long. Besides what proofs of it, for ought I know this may be a trick, I had rather have him a Prisoner, where I might visit him, and do him service, then not at all, or I know not where. Dub. Well sir, the end wil shew it, what's that a challenge? Long. Yes, wher's Orleance? though we fight in jest he must meet with Amiens in earnest,—fall off, we are discovered; my horse garcon ha'. Dub. Were it not in a house and in his presence, To whom I owe all duty— Long. What would it do? prate as it do's? but be as far from stricking as he that owes it Orleans. Dub. How? Long. I think thou art his Porter, Set here to answer creditors, that his Lordship Is not within or takes the diet. I am sent, And wil grow here untill I have an answer, Not to demand a debt of money, but To call him to a strict account for wrong Done to the honors of a Gentleman, Which nothing but his heart-bloud shall wash off. Dub. Shall I hear this? Long. And more, that if I may not Have accesse to him, I will fix this here To his disgrace and thine. Dub. And thy life with it. Long. Then have the coppies of it pasted on posts, Like Phamplet titles that sue to be sold; Have his disgrace talk for Tobacco shops, His picture bafful'd. Dub. All respect away, wer't in a Church— draw both Long. This is the book I pray with. Orl. Forbear upon your lives. Long. What are you rous'd? I hope your Lordship can read (though he staine not his birth with scholler-ship) doth it not please you now? if you are a right Mounsier, muster up the rest of your attendance, which is a page, a cook, a pander, coach-man, and a foot man, in these dayes a great Lords traine, pretending I am unworthy to bring you a challenge, in stead of answering it, have me kik't. Dub. If he does thou deserv'st it. Long. I dare you all to touch me, I'le not stand still, What answer you? Orl. That thou hast done to Amience The office of a faithfull friend which I Would cherish in thee were he not my foe, How ever since on honorable tearmes He cals me forth, say I will meet with him, And by Dubois ere Sun-set make him know The time and place, my swords length, and what ever Scruple of circumstance he can expect. Long. This answer comes unlookt for, far you well, Finding your temper thus, wood I had sayd lesse. Exit. Orl. Now Comes thy love to the test. Dub. My Lord 'twill hold, And in all dangers prove it selfe true gold. Exeunt Enter Laverdine La-poop Malicorne, servant. Ser. I wil acquaint my Lady with your comming. Please you repose your selves here. Mal. Ther's a tester, nay now I am a woer I must be bountifull. Ser. If you would have two three-pences for it sir, To give some of your kindred as you ride, I'le see if I can get them; we use not (tho Servants) to take Bribes. Exit. Lav. Then thou art unfit, to be in office either in Court or City. La-p. Indeed corruption is a Tree whose branches are of an unmeasurable length they spread every where, and the dew that drops from thence have infected some chayres and stooles of authority. Mal. Ah Captaine, lay not all the fault upon Officers you know you can shark though you be out of action, witnesse Montague. Lav. Hang him, hee's safe enough; you had a hand in it to and have gained by him; but I wonder you Citizens that keep so many bookes, and take such strict accounts for every farthing due to you from others, reserve not so much as a memorandum for the curtesies you receive. Mal. Would you have a Citizen book those? thankfulnes is a thing we are not sworn to in our indentures: you may as well urge conscience. Lav. Talke no more of such vanities. Montague is irrecoverably sunk, I would we had twenty more to send after him; the Snake that would be a Dragon and have wings must eate; and what imployes that but this, that in this Canniball age he that would have the sute of wealth must not care—whom he feeds on? and as I have heard no flesh battens better, then that of a profest friend; and he that would mount to honour must not make dainty to use the head of his mother, back of his father, or neck of his brother, for ladders to his preferment; for but observe, and you shall finde for the most part cunning villany sit at a feast as principall guest, and Innocent honesty waite as a contemn'd servant with a trencher. La-p. The Ladies. Enter Mountague bare-headed, Lamira, Lady Orleance, Charlo, Veramour, salute. Mont. Do yee smell nothing? Cha. Not I sir. Mont. The carrion of knaves is very strong in my nostrels. Lav. We came to admire, and finde fame was a niggard Which we thought prodigall in our report Before we saw you. Lam. Tush sir, this Courtship's old. La-p. Ile fight for thee sweet wench, This is my tongue and woes for me? Lam. Good man of War, Hands of; if you take me it must be by siege, Not by an onset; and for your valour, I Think that I have deserved few enemies, And therefore need it not. Mal. Thou needst nothing sweet Lady, but an obsequious husband, and where wilt thou finde him, if not in the City we are true Moscovits to our Wives, and are never better pleased, then when they use us as slaves, bridle and saddle us; have me, thou shalt command all my wealth as thine own, thou shalt sit like a Queen in my ware house; And my factors at the returne with my ships shall pay thee tribute of all the rarities of the earth; thou shalt wear gold, feed on delicates, the first peascods-strauberies, grapes, cherries shall— Lam. Be mine; I apprehend what you would say, Those dainties which the City payes so dear for, The Country yeilds for nothing, and as early; And credit me your far fet viandes please not My appetite better then those that are neer hand. Then for your promis'd service and subjection To all my humors, when I am your wife, Which as it seemes is frequent in the City, I cannot finde what pleasure they receive In using there fond husbands like their Maydes; But of this more hereafter; I accept Your proffer kindly, and yours; my house stands open To entertain you; take your pleasure in it, And ease after your journey. La. Orl. Do you note the boldnesse of the fellowes? Lam. Alas Madam, a virgin must in this be like a lawyer, And as he takes all fees, shee must hear all suitors; the One for gaine, the other for her mirth; stay with the Gentlemen, wee'l to the Orchards. Exeunt Lamira, La. Orle. Veram. Charl. La-p. —what art thou? Mont. An honest man, though poor; And look they like to monsters, are they so rare? Lav. Rose from the dead. Mal. Do you heare Mounsier Serviture, didst thou never heare of one Montague a prodigall gull, that lives about Paris? Mont. So sir. Lav. One that after the losse of his maine estate in a Law sute, bought an Office in the Court. La-p. And should have letters of Mart, to have the Spanish treasure as it came from the Indies; were not thou and he twins? put of thy hat, let me see thy forehead. Mont. Though you take priviledge to use your tongues, I pray you hold your fingers, 'Twas your base cozenage made me as I am, And were you some where else I would take off This proud filme from your eyes, that will not tell you, Know I am Montague. Enter Lamira behinde the Arras. Lam. I will observe this better. Lav. And art thou he? I wil do thee grace; give me thy hand; I am glad thou hast taken so good a course; serve God and please thy Mistris; if I prove to be thy Master as I am very likely, I will do for thee. Mal. Faith the fellow's well made for a servingman, and will no doubt carry a chyne of Beefe with good grace. La-p. Prithee be carefull of me in my chamber, I will remember thee at my departure. Mont. All this I can indure under this roof, And so much owe I her, whose now I am, That no wrong shall incense me to molest Her quiet house; while you continue here, I will not be ashamed to do you service More then to her, because such is her pleasure. But you that have broke thrice, and fourteen times Compounded for two shillings in the pound, Know I dare kick you in your shop; do ye hear? If ever I see Paris, though an army Of musty Murrions, rusty brown bils and clubs, Stand for your guard—I have heard of your tricks, And you that smell of Amber at my charge, And triumph in your cheat; well I may live To meet thee, be it among a troop of such That are upon the faire face of the Court Like running ulcers, and before thy whore Trampell upon thee. La-p. This a language for a livery? take heed, I am a Captaine. Mont. A Cox-comb are you not? that thou and I To give proof, which of us dares most, were now In mid'st of a rough Sea, upon a piece Of a split ship, where only one might ride, Exit Lamira from the Arras. I would—but foolish anger makes me talke Like a Player. Lam. Indeed you act a part Doth ill become you my servant; is this your duty? Mont. I crave your pardon, and wil hereafter be more circumspect. Lav. Oh the power of a Womans tongue! it had done more then we three with our swords durst undertake: put a madde man to silence. Lam. Why Sirra these are none of your comrades To drink with in the celler; one of them For ought you know may live to be your Master. La-p. Ther's some comfort yet. Lam. Here's choyce of three, a wealthy Merchant. Mal. Hem, shee's taken, she hath spy'd my good Calf, And many Ladies chuse their husbands by that. Lam. A Courtier that's in grace, a valiant Captaine, And are these mates for you? away be gon. Mont. I humbly pray you will be pleased to pardon, And to give satisfaction to you Madam. (Although I break my heart) I will confesse That I have wrong'd them too, and make submission. Lam. No I'le spare that; goe bid the Cook haste Supper. Exit Mont. La-p. Oh brave Lady thou art worthy to have servants, to be commandresse of a Family, that knowst how to use and govern it. Lav. You shall have many Mistresses that will so mistake as to take their horse keepers, and footemen insteed of their Husbands, thou art none of those. Mal. But she that can make distinction of men, and knowes when she hath gallants, and fellowes of rank and quality in her house— Lam. Gallants indeed, if it be the Gallants fashion To triumph in the miseries of a man, Of which they are the cause: one that transcends (In spight of all that fortune hath, or can be done) A million of such things as you, my doores Stand open to receive all such as wear The shape of Gentlemen, and my gentlier nature (I might say weaker) weighes not the expence Of entertainment; think you i'le forget yet What's due unto my selfe? do not I know, That you have dealt with poor Montague, but like Needy Commanders, cheating Citizens, And perjured Courtiers? I am much mov'd, else use not To say so much, if you will bear your selves As fits such you would make me think you are, You may stay; if not the way lies before you. Exit. Mal. What think you of this Captaine? La-p. That this is a baudy house, with Pinacles and Turrets, in which this disguised Montague goes to rut gratis, and that this is a landed pandresse, and makes her house a brothell for charity. Mal. Come, that's no miracle; but from whence derive you the supposition? Lav. Observe but the circumstance; you all know that in the height of Montagues prosperity, hee did affect and had his love return'd by this Lady Orleans; since her divorcement, and his decay of estate, it is knowne, they have met not so much as his boy is wanting; and that this can be any thing else then a meer plot for their night work, is above my imagination to conceive. Mal. Nay it carries probability, let us observe it better, but yet with such caution as our prying be not discovered: here's all things to be had without cost, and therefore good staying here. La-p. Nay that's true, I would we might woe her twenty years like Penelopes sutors; come Laverdine. Exeunt Malli. La-Poop. Lav. I follow instantly, yonder he is. Enter Viramor. The thought of this Boy hath much coold my affection to his Lady, and by all conjectures, this is a disguised whore; I will try if I can search this Mine. Page— Ver. Your pleasure sir? Lav. Thou art a pritty Boy. Ver. And you a brave man: now I am out of your debt. Lav. Nay prithy stay. Uer. I am in haste sir. Lav. By the faith of a Courtyer. Uer. Take heed what you say, you have taken a strange Oath. Lav. I have not seene a youth that hath pleased me better, I would thou could'st like me, so far as to leave thy Lady and waite on me, I would maintaine thee in the bravest Cloaths. Ver. Though you took them up on trust, or bought 'em at the brokers. Lav. Or any way: then thy imployments should bee so neate and cleanly, thou shouldst not touch a payre of Pantables in a Moneth, and thy lodging— Uer. Should be in a brothell. Lav. No, but in mine armes. Ver. That my be the circle of a Baudy house, or worse. Lav. I meane thou shouldest lie with me. Uer. Lie with you? I had rather lie with my Ladies Monkey; 'twas never a good World since our French Lords learned of the Neopolitans; to make their Pages their Bed-fellowes, doth more hurt to the Suburbe Ladies then tweenty dead Vacations; Tis Supper time sir. Exit Ueram. Lav. I thought so, I know by that 'tis a Woman, for because peradventure she hath made tryall of the Monkey, she preferrs him before me, as one unknown; well these are standing Creatures, and have strange desires; And men must use strange meanes to quench strange fires.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus Scæna Prima. Enter Montague, alone, in meane habit. Mont. Now Montague, who discerns thy spirit now? Thy breeding or thy bloud? here's a poor cloud Ecclipseth all thy splendor; who can reade In thy pale face, dead eye, or lenten shute, The liberty thy ever giving hand Hath bought for others, manacling it selfe In gives of parchment indissoluble? The greatest hearted man supplyed with meanes, Nobility of birth and gentlest parts, I though the right hand of his Soveraigne, If vertue quit her seat in his high soule, Glitters but like a Pallace set on fire, Whose glory whilst it shines, but ruins him, And his bright show each houre to ashes tending Shall at the last be rak't up like a sparkle, Unlesse mens lives and fortunes feede the flame. Not for my own wants though blame I my Stars, But suffering others to cast love on me, When I can neither take nor thankfull be. My Ladies woman, faire and vertuous Young as the present moneth, sollicits me For love and marriage now being nothing worth— Enter Veramour with Counters. Ver. Oh Master, I have sought you a long hour, Good faith, I never joyd out of your fight; For Gods sake sir be merry, or else beare The Buffets of your fortunes with more scorn; Do but begin to raile, teach me the way, And Ile sit down and help your anger forth: I have known you weare a suit full worth a Lordship, Give to a man whose need nere frighted you From calling of him friend, five hundred Crowns Ere sleep had left your sences to consider Your own important present uses; yet Since I have seen you with a trencher waite, Voide of all scorne, therefore Ile waite on you. Mont. Would God thou wert lesse honest. Ver. Would to God you were lesse worthy: I am even wee sir. Mont. Is not thy Master strangely fallen, when thou Servest for no wages, but for charity? Thou dost surcharge me with thy plenteous love: The goodnesse of thy vertue shown to me, More opens still my disability To quit thy pains: Credit me loving boy, A free and honest nature may be opprest, Tir'd with curtesies from a liberall spirit, When they exceed his means of gratitude. Ver. But tis a due in him that to that end Extends his love or duty. Mont. Little world Of vertue, why dost love and follow me? Uer. I will follow you through all Countries, Ile run (fast as I can) by your horse side, Ile hold your stirrop when you doe alight, And without grudging waite till you returne: Ile quit offerd meanes, and expose my selfe To cold and hunger still to be with you; Fearlesse Ile travell through a wildernesse, And when you are weary, I will lay me down That in my bosome you may rest your head, Where whilst you sleep, Ile watch that no wild beast Shall hurt or trouble you: and thus we'l breed a story To make every hearer weep, When they discourse our fortunes and our loves. Mont. Oh what a scoffe might men of Wormes make, If they did know this boy? but my desire Is that thou wouldest not (as thou usest still When like a servant I 'mong servants sit) Waite on my Trencher, fill my cups with wine: Why shouldst thou doe this boy? prethee consider, I am not what I was. Ver. Curst be the day when I forget that Montague was my Lord, or not remember him my Master still. Mont. Rather curse me, with whom thy youth hath spent So many houres, and yet untaught to live By any worldly qualitie. Ver. Indeed you never taught me how to handle Cards To cheat and cozen men with oathes and lies; Those are the worldly qualities to live: Some of our Scarlet Gallants teach their boyes These worldly qualities. Since stumbling fortune then leaves vertue thus Let me leave fortune, ere be vicious. Mont. Oh lad, thy love will kill me. Uer. In truth, I think in conscience I shall die for you: Good Master weep not, doe you want aught sir? Will you have any money? here's some Silver; And here's a little Gold, 'twill serve to play, And put more troublesome thoughts out of your mind: I pray sir take it, Ile get more with singing. And then Ile bring it you; my Lady ga't me, And—it was not covetousnesse, But I forgot to tell you sooner on't. Mont. Alasse boy, thou art not bound to tell it me, And lesse to give it, buy thee Scarfes and Garters, And when I have money, I will give thee a Sword: Nature made thee a beauteous Cabinet To lock up all the godnesse of the Earth. Enter Charlote. Ver. I have lost my voyce with the very sight of this Gentlewoman: good sir steale away, you were wont to be a curious avoyder of womens company. Mont. Why boy, thou darst trust me any where, darst thou not? Ver. I had rather trust you by a roaring Lyon, then a ravening woman. Mont. Why boy. Ver. Why truly she devoures more mans flesh— Mont. I, But she roares not boy. Uer. No sir, why she is never silent but when her mouth is full. Charl. Mounsier Montague. Mont. My sweet fellow, since you please to call me so. Ver. Ah my conscience she would be pleased well enough to call you bedfellow: oh Master, do not hold her by the hand so: a woman is a lyme-bush, that catcheth all she toucheth. Charl. I do most dangerously suspect this boy to be a wench; art thou not one? come hither, let me feele thee. Ver. With all my heart. Charl. Why dost thou pull off thy glove? Ver. Why, to feele whether you be a boy, or no. Charl. Fie boy, goe too, Ile not looke your head, nor combe your locks any more, if you talke thus. Ver. Why, ile sing to you no more then. Charl. Fie upon't, how sad you are? a young Gentleman that was the very Sunne of France. Mont. But I am in the eclipse now. Charl. Suffer himselfe to be over-run with a Lethargy of melancholy and discontent! rouze up thy spirit, man, and shake it off: A Noble soule is like a ship at Sea, That sleepes at Anchor when the Ocean's calme; But when she rages, and the wind blows high, He cuts his way with skill and Majesty. I would turn a foole, or Poet, or any thing, or marry, to make you merry; prethee let's walke: good Veramour leave thy Master and me, I have earnest businesse with him. Ver. Pray doe you leave my Master, and me; we were very merry before you came, he does not covet womens companie. What have you to do with him? come sir will you goe? And ile sing to you again: I faith his mind is stronger then to credit womens vows, and too pure to be capable of their loves. Charl. The boy is jealous; sweet lad leave us; my Lady call'd for you I sweare: that's a good child, there's a piece of Gold for thee, go buy a Feather. Ver. There's two pieces for you, do you goe and buy one, or what you will, or nothing so you goe. Nay then I see you would have me go sir; why, 'faith I will; now I perceive you love her better then you doe me; but God blesse you whatever you do, or intend; I know you are a very honest man. Exit. Charl. Still shall I woe thee, whilst thy eares reply I cannot, or I will not marry thee? Why hast thou drawn the blood out of my cheeks, And given a quicker motion to my heart? Oh thou hast bred a fever in my veines Call'd love, which no Physitian can cure; Have mercy on a maid whose simple youth— Mont. How your example fairest teacheth me A ceremonious Idolatry! kneels. By all the joy of love I love thee better Then I or any man can tell another; And will expresse the mercy which thou crav'st, I will forbeare to marry thee: consider Thou art natures heire in feature, and thy parents In faire inheritances; rise with these thoughts, And look on me; but with a womans eye, A decayd fellow, voyd of means and spirit. Charl. Of spirit? Mont. Yes, could I tamely live, Forget my fathers blood, waite and make legs, Staine my best breeches, with the servile drops That fall from others draughts: Charl. This vizard wherewith thou wouldst hide thy spirit Is perspective, to shew it plainlier. This under-value of thy life is but Because I should not buy thee; what more speaks Greatnesse of man, then valiant patience, That shrinks not under his fates strongest strokes? These Roman deaths, as falling on a Sword, Opening of veines, with poyson quenching thirst, (Which we erroneously doe stile the deeds Of the heroicke and magnanimous man) Was dead-eyd cowardise, and white cheeke feare, Who doubting tyranny, and fainting under Fortunes false Lottery, desperately runne To death for dread of death; that soules most stout, That bearing all mischance, dares last it out; Will you performe your word, and marry me, When I shall call you to't? Enter Longueville with a riding-rod. Mont. I'faith I will. Charl. Who's this alights here? Long, With leave faire creature, are you the Lady Mistris of the house? Charl. Her servant sir. Long. I pray then favour me, to inform your Lady, and Duke Orleans wife, A businesse of emport awaites 'em here, And craves for speedy answer. Charl. Are you in post sir? Long. No, I am in Satin Lady; I would you would be in post. Charl. I will returne, Sweet. Exit. Long. Honest friend, doe you belong to the house? I pray be covered. Mont. Yes Sir; I doe. Long. Ha, dreamst thou Longaville? sure tis not he: sir I should know you. Mont. So should I you, but that I am asham'd. But though thou knowst me, prethee Longaville, Mock not my poverty, pray remember your selfe; Showes it not strangely for thy cloathes to stand Without a hat to mine? mocke me no more. Long. The?embroyder me all over sir, If ever I began to mocke you yet. The—on me, why should I weare Velvet And Silver Lace,—I will teare it off. Mont. Why mad-man? Long. Put on my Hat? yes, when I am hangd I will: —I could break my head For holding eyes that knew not you at first: But time and fortune run your courses with him, He'l laugh and storm you, when you shew most hate. Enter Lamira, Orleans Lady, Laverdine, La Poope, Malycorne, Veramour, Charlot: Lam. You're a fair Mounsier. Long. Doe you mocke me Lady? Lam. Your businesse sir, I mean. Lady. Regard your selfe good Mounsier Longueville. Lam. You are too negligent of your selfe and place, Cover your head sweet Mounsier. Long. Mistake me not faire Ladies, Tis not to you, nor you, that I stand bare. Lav. Nay sweet deere Mounsier, let it not be to us then. La-p. —a complement. Mal. And—of manners. Pray hide your head, your gallants use to do't. Long. And you your forheads, why you needfull accessary rascals, That cannot live without your mutuall knaveries, More then a Bawd, a Pandor, or a Whore From one another; how dare you suspect That I stand bare to you? what make you here? Shift your house Lady of 'em, for I know 'em, They come to steale Napkins, and your Spoons; Look to your Silver-bodkin, (Gentlewoman) Tis a dead utensil, and Page 'ware your pockets; My reverence is unto this man, my master, Whom you with protestations, and oaths As high as Heaven, as deep as hell, which would Deceive the wisest man of honest nature, Have cozned and abus'd; but I may meet you, And beate you one with t'other. Mont. Peace, no more. Long. Not a word sir. Lav. I am something thicke of hearing; what said he? La-p. I heare him, but regard him not. Mal. Nor I, I am never angry fasting. Long. My love keeps back my duty, noblest Lady; If husband or brother merit love from you, Prevent their dangers, this houre brings to triall Their hereto sleeping hates; by this time each Within a yerd is of the others heart, And met to prove their causes and their spirits With their impartiall Swords points; haste and save, Or never meet them more but at the grave. Lady. Oh my distracted heart, that my wrackt honour Should for a brothers, or a husbands life, through thy undoing die. Lam. Amiens engagd; if he miscarry all my hopes and joys, I now confesse it loudly, are undone: Caroch, and haste, one minute may betray A life more worth then all time can repay. Exeunt Ladies, &amp; Mont. Mal. Hump: Mounsier Laverdine pursues this boy extreamly. Captaine what will you doe? La-p. Any thing but follow to this Sea-service; I am a Sea-captaine you know, and to offer to part 'em, without we could do't like water-men with long staves, a quarter of a mile off, might be dangerous. Mal. Why then let's retire and pray for 'em, I am resolv'd to stop your intent; abus'd more then we have been we cannot be, without they fall to flat beating o'us. Exeunt Maly. La-poop. Lav. And that were unkindly done i'faith. Ver. —but you are the troublesomest Asse that ere I met with; retire, you smel like a womans chamber, that's newly up, before she have pinsht her vapours in with her cloathes. Lav. I will haunt thee like thy Grandames ghost, thou shalt never rest for me. Uer. Well, I perceive tis vaine to conceale a secret from you: believe it sir, indeed I am a woman. Lav. Why la; I knew't, this Propheticall tongue of mine never faild me; my mother was halfe a witch, never any thing that she forespake, but came to passe: a woman? how happy am I? now we may lawfully come together without feare of hanging; Sweet wench, be gracious, in honourable sort I woe, no otherwise. Uer. Faith the truth is I have loved you long. Lav. See, see. Uer. But durst not open it. Lav. —I think so. Uer. But briefly, when you bring it to the test, if there be not one Gentleman in this house, wil challenge more interest in me, then you can, I am at your disposure. Exit. Lav. Oh Fortunatus, I envie thee not For cap, or pouch, this day Ile prove my Fortune, In which your Lady doth elect her husband, Who will be Amiens, 'twill save my wedding dinner, Povera, La-poop and Malicorne: if all faile, I wil turne Citizen, a beauteous wife Is the horn-booke to the richest Tradesmans life. Exeunt. Enter Duboys, Orleans, Longueville, Amiens, two Lacques, a Page wish two Pistols. Dub. Here's a good even piece of ground my Lords: Will you fix here? Orl. Yes anywhere; Lacquey, take off my spurs; Upon a bridge, a raile but my Swords bredth, upon a battlement, Ile fight this quarrell. Dub. O' the ropes, my Lord. Orl. Upon a line. Dub. So all our Countrie Duels are carried, like a fireworke on a thred. Orl. Go now stay with the horses, and doe you heare Upon your lives, till some of us come to you, Dare not to looke this way. Dub. Except you see strangers or others that by chance or purpose are like to interrupt us. Orl. Then give warning. Long. Who takes a Sword? the advantage is so small, As he that doubts hath the free leave to choose. Orl. Come give me any, and search me; tis not The ground, weapon, or seconds that can make Oddes in those fatall trials: but the cause. Ami. Most true, and but it is no time to wish When men are come to do, I would desire The cause 'twixt us were other then it is; But where the right is, there prevaile our Swords. And if my sister have outliv'd her honour, I doe not pray I may outlive her shame. Orl. Your sister Amiens, is a whore, at once. Ami. You oft have spoke that sence to me before, But never in this language Orleance; And when yov spoke it faire, and first, I told you That it was possible you might be abus'd: But now, since you forget your manners, you shall finde, If I transgresse my custome, you doe lie, And are a villaine, which I had rather yet My Sword had prov'd, then I been forc'd to speake: Nay give us leave, and since you stand so haughtily And highly on your cause, let you and I, Without engaging these two Gentlemen, singly determine it. Long. My Lord, you'l pardon us. Dub. I trust your Lordships may not doe us that affront. Ami. As how? Dub. We kisse your Lordships hand, and come to serve you here with Swords. Long. My Lord, we understand our selves. Dub. We have had the honour to be call'd unto the businesse, and we must not now quit it on terms. Ami. Not terms of reason? Long. No, no reason for the quitting of our calling. Dub. True if I be call'd to't I must aske no reason. Long. Nor heare none neither, which is lesse: It is a favour if my throat be cut, Your Lordship does me; which I never can, A noise within, crying down with their Swords. Nor must have hope how to requite: what noise, What cry is that my Lord upon your guard? Some treachery is a foot. Enter Lady Orleans, Lamira, Montague. Lady. O here they are: My Lord (deare Lady helpe me) helpe me all; I have so woefull interest in both, I know not which to feare for most: and yet I must prefer my Lord. Deare brother, You are too understanding, and too Noble To be offended, when I know my duty, Though scarce my teares will let me so to do it. Orl. Out loathed strumpet. Lady. O my dearest Lord, If words could on me cast the name of whore, I then were worthy to be loath'd; but know, Your unkindnesse cannot make me wicked; And therefore should lesse use that power upon me. Orl. Was this your art to have these actors come, To make this interlude? withdraw, cold man, And if thy spirit be not frozen up, Give me one stroke yet at thee for my vengeance. Ami. Thou shalt have stroakes, and stroakes, thou glorious man, Till thou breathst thinner ayre then that thou talkest. Lam. My Lord Count Amiens. Lady. Princely husband. Orl. Whore. Lam. You wrong her impudent Lord; O that I had the bulke Of those dull men; look how they stand, and no man Will revenge an innocent Lady. Ami. You hinder it Madam. Lam. I would hinder you; is there none else to kill him? Lady. Kill him Madam? have you learn'd that bad Language? O repent, And be the motive, rather both kill me. Orl. Then die my infamy. Mont. Hold bloody man. Orl. Art thou their Basiliske? Mont: To strike thee dead, but that thy fate deserves some weightier hand. Dub. Sweet my Lord. Orl. O here's a plot; you bring your champions with you; the adultresse with the adulterer: Out howling— Dub. Good my Lord. Orl. Are you her Graces countenance Lady, the receiver to the poore vicious couple. Dub. Sweet my Lord. Orl. Sweet rascall, didst not thou tell me, false fellow, This Montague, here was murdered? Dub. I did so; but he was falser, and a worthlesse Lord, Like thy foule selfe, that would have had it so. Long. Orleance tis true, and shall be prov'd upon thee. Mont. Thy malice Duke, and this thy wicked nature, are all as visible as thou; but I borne to contemne thy injuries, doe know, that though thy greatnesse may corrupt a Jury, and make a Judge afraid, and carry out a world of devils with thy title: yet thou art not quiet at home, thou bearest about thee that, that doth charge thee, and condemne thee too. The thing that grieves me more, and doth indeed displease me, is, to thinke that so much basenesse stands here to have encountered so much honour: Pardon me my Lord what late my passion spake, when you provok'd my innocence. Orl. Yes doe, O flattery becomes him better then the sute he weares; give him a new one Amiens. Ami. Orleance, tis here no time nor place, to jest or raile Poorely with you, but I will finde a time to Whisper you forth to this or some fit place, As shall not hold a second interruption. Mont. I hope your Lordships honour, and your life Are destined unto higher hazzards; this is of A meaner arme. Dub. Yes faith, or none. Long. He is not fit to fall by an honest Sword, A Prince and lie! Dub. And slander, and hire men To publish the false rumours he hath made. Long. And sticke 'em on his friends, and innocents. Dub. And practice against their lives after their fames. Long. In men that are the matter of all leudnesse, Bauds, thieves, and cheaters, it were monstrous. Dub. But in a man of blood, how more conspicuous? Ami. Can this be? Lady. They doe slander him. Orl. Hang them, a paire of railing hangbies. Long. How? stand Orleance; stay, give me my Pistols boy, Hinder me not, by— I will kill him. Lady. O stay his fury, Ami. Longueville, my friend. Long. Not for my selfe, my Lord, but for mankind, And all that have an interest to vertue, Or title unto innocence. Ami. Why heare me. Long. For justice sake. Ami. That cannot be. Long. To punish his wives, your honour, and my Lords wrongs here, whom I must ever call so; for your loves Ile sweare, Ile sacrifice— Ami. Longaville, I did not thinke you a murtherer before. Long. I care not what you thought me. Ami. By—If thou attempt His life, thy own is forfeit. Mont. Foolish frantick man, the murder will be of us, not him. Lady. O God. Mont. We could have kild him, but we would not take The justice out of fates.— Singe but a haire of him, thou diest. Long. No matter, shoot. Ami. Villaine. Dub. My Lord, your sister is slaine. Ami. Biancha? Mont. O haplesse and most wretched chance. Lam. Standst thou looking upon the mischief thou hast made Thou Godlesse man, feeding thy blood-shot eyes With the red spectacle, and art not turn'd to stone With horrour? hence and take the wings of thy blacke Infamy, to carry thee beyond the shoot of looks, Or sound of curses, which will pursue thee still: Thou hast out-fled all but thy guilt. Orl. O wish it off again, for I am crack'd Under the burden, and my heart will breake. How heavy guilt is, when men come to feele If you could know the mountaine I sustaine With horror, you would each take off your part, And more, to ease me: I cannot stand, Forgive where I have wrong'd I pray. Ami. Looke to him Montague. Long. My Lords and Gentlemen, the Lady is well but for feare, Unlesse that have shot her; I have the worst on't, that needs would venture Upon a tricke had like to ha' cost my guts: Look to her, she'l be well, it was but Powder I chargd with, thinking that a guilty man Would have been frighted sooner; but I am glad He's come at last. Lam. How is Byancha? well? Ami. Lives she? see sister, doth she breath? Lady. O Gentlemen, thinke you I can breath, That am restored to the hatefull sense Of feeling in me my deare husbands death? O no, I live not; life was that I left; And what you have cal'd me to, is death indeed; I cannot weep so fast as he doth bleed. Dub. Pardon me Madam, he is well. Lady. Ha my husband. Orl. I cannot speake whether my joy or shame Be greater, but I thank the Heavens for both. O look not black upon me, all my friends, To whom I will be reconciled, or grow unto This earth, till I have weept a trench That shall be great enough to be my grave, And I will think them too most manly teares, If they do move your pities: it is true, Man should do nothing that he should repent; But if he have, and say that he is sorry, It is a worse fault if he be not truly. Lam. My Lord, such sorrow cannot be suspected: Here take your honoured wife, and joyn your hands. —she hath married you again: And Gentlemen, I do invite you all, This night to take my house, where on the morrow, To heighten more the reconciling feast, Ile make my selfe a husband and a guest. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Scæna prima. Enter Montague and Charlote. Char. Well now I am sure you are mine. Mont. I am sure I am glad I have one to own then; you'l finde me honest As these daies go, enough; poore without question, Which beggars hold a vertue; give me meat, and I Shall do my worke, else knock my shooes off, And turn me out again. Char. You are a merry fellow. Mont. I have no great cause. Char. Yes thy love to me. Mont. That's as we make our game. Char. Why you repent then. Mon. Faith no wors then I am I cannot be; Much better I expect not: I shall love you, And when you bid me goe to bed, obey, Lie still or move, as you shall minister, Keep a foure-nobles Nag, and a black Merling, learn to love Ale, and play at two-hand Irish, And there's then all I aime at. Char. Nay sweet fellow, Ile make it something better. Mont. If you doe, you'l make me worse: Now I am poore, and willing to doe wel, Hold me in that course, of all the Kings creatures, I hate his coyne, keep me from that, and save me; For if you chance out of your housewifery To leave a hundred pound or two, bestow it In Plum-broth ere I know it, else I take it; Seeke out a hundred men that want this money, Share it among 'em, they'l cry noble Montague, And so I stand again at livery. Char. You have pretty fancies sir, but married once, This charity will fall home to your selfe. Mont. I would it would, I am afraid my loosenesse Is yet scarce stopt, though it have nought to worke on But the meere aire of what I have had. Char. Pretty. Mont. I wonder sweet heart why you'l marry me, I can see nothing in my selfe deserves it, Unlesse the handsome wearing of a band, For that's my stocke now, or a paire of garters, Necessity will not let me loose. Char. I see sir a great deale more, a hansome man, a husband To make a right good woman truely happy. Mont. Lord, where are my eyes? either you are foolish As wenches once a yeere are, or far worse, Extreamly vertuous, can you love a poore man That relies on cold meat and cast stockings, One onely suit to his backe, which now is mewing? But what will be the next coate will pose Tristram. If I should leavy from my friends a fortune: I could not raise ten groats to pay the Priest now. Char. Ile do that duty; tis not means nor money Makes me pursue your love; were your mind bankrupt, I would never love you. Enter Lamica. Mont. Peace wench, here's my Lady. Lam. Nay never shrinke i'th wetting, for my presence; D'ee finde her willing Montague? Mont. Willing Madam? Lam. How dainty you make of it, doe not I know You two love one another? Mont. Certaine Madam, I thinke ye'ave revelations of these matters: Your Ladyship cannot tell me when I kist her. Lam. But she can, sir. Mont. But she will not Madam; For when they talke once, tis like fairy-money, They get no more close kisses. Lam. Thou art wanton. Mont. God knows I need not, yet I would be lusty: But—my provender scarce pricks me. Lam. It shall be mended Montague, I am glad you are grown so merry. Mont. So am I too Madam. Lam. You two will make a pretty hansome consort. Mont. Yes Madam, if my fiddle faile me not. Lam. Your Fiddle? why your Fiddle? I warrant thou meanest madly: Mont. Can you blame me? alasse I am in love. Char. Tis very well sir. Lam. How long have you been thus? Mont. How thus in love? Lam. You are very quick sir: no, I mean thus pleasant. Mont. —Ever since I was poore. Lam. A little wealth would change you then. Mont. Yes Lady into another suit, but never more Into another man: Ile bar that mainly, The wealth I get henceforward shal be charm'd For ever hurting me, Ile spend it fasting: As I live noble Lady there is nothing I have found directly cures the melancholy, But want and wedlocke; when I had store of money I simper'd sometime, and spoke wondrous wise, But never laught out-right; now I am empty My heart sounds like a bell, and strikes at both sides. Lam. You are finely temper'd Montague. Mont. Pardon Lady, if any way my free mirth have offended, Twas meant to please you: if it prove too sawsie, Give it a frown, and I am ever silenc'd. Lam. I like it passing well; pray follow it: This is my day of choice, and shall be yours too, Twere pity to delay ye: call to the Steward, And tell him tis my pleasure he should give you 500 Crowns: make your selfe hansome Montague, Let none weare better cloathes, tis for my credit; But pray be merry still. Mont. If I be not, and make a foole of twice as many hundreds, Clap me in Canvas Lady. Exeunt. Enter La-poope, Laverdine, and Malycorne. Lav. I am strangely glad, I have found the mystery Of this disguised boy out: I ever trusted It was a woman, and how happily I have found it so; and for my selfe, I am sure One that would offer me a thousand pound now (And that's a pretty sum to make one stagger) In ready Gold for this concealment, could not Buy my hope of her, she's a dainty wench, And such a one I finde I want extreamly To bring me into credit: beauty does it. Mal. Say we should all meach here, and stay the feast, now what can the worst be? we have plai'd the knaves, that's without question. La-p. True, and as I take it this is the first truth We told these ten yeeres, and for any thing I know may be the last: but grant we are knaves, Both base and beastly knaves— Mal. Say so then. Lav. Well. La-p. And likewise let it be considered, we have wrongd And most maliciously, this Gentlewoman, We cast to stay with, what must we expect now? Mal. I there's the point, we would expect good eating. La-p. I know we would, but we may find good beating. Lav. You say true Gentlemen, and by— Though I love meat as well as any man, I care not what he be, if a eate a Gods name; Such crab-sauce to my meat wil turn my pallate. Mal. There's all the hazzard, for the frozen Montague Has now got spring againe, and warmth in him, And without doubt dares beat us terribly. For not to mint the matter, we are cowards, And have and shall be beaten when men please To call us into cudgelling. La-p. I feele we are very prone that way. Lav. The sonnes of Adam. La-p. Now here then rests the state o'th question? Whether we yeild our bodies for a dinner To a sound dog-whip, for I promise ye If men be given to correction, We can expect no lesse, or quietly Take a hard Egge or two, and ten mile hence Baite in a ditch, this we may do securely; For to stay here about will be all one, If once our morall mischiefes come in memory. Mal. But pray ye hear me, is not this the day The Virgin Lady doth elect her husband? Lav. The dinner is to that end. Mal. Very well then, say we all stay, and say we all scape this whipping, and be well entertained, and one of us carry the Lady. La-p. 'Tis a seemly saying, I must confesse, but if we stay, how fitly We may apply it to our selves (i'th end) Will aske a Christian feare; I cannot see If I say true, what spetiall ornaments Of art or nature, lay aside our lying Whoring and drinking, which are no great vertues, We are endued withall to win this Lady. Mal. Yet women go not by the best parts ever; that I have found directly. Lav. Why should we fear then? they choose men As they feed; some times they settle Upon a white broth'd face, a sweet smooth gallant, And him they make an end of in a night; Sometimes a Goose, sometimes, a grosser meat, A rump of beef will serve 'em at some season, And fill their bellies too: though without doubt They are great devourers: stock fish is a dish, If it be well drest, for the tufnesse sake Wil make the proud'st of 'em long and leap for't. They'l run mad for a pudding ere they'l starve, La-p. For my own part I care not, come what can come, If I be whipt, why so be it; if cudgel'd, I hope I shall out live it, I am sure 'Tis not the hundreth time I have bin serv'd so, And yet I thank God I am here. Mal. Here's resolution. La-p. A little patience, and a rotten Apple Cures twenty worse diseases; what say you sir? Lav. Marry I say sir, if I had bin acquainted With lamming in my youth, as you have bin With whipping, and such benefits of nature, I should do better: as I am, i'le venture, And if it be my luck to have the Lady, I'le use my fortune modestly; if beaten You shall not hear a word, one I am sure of, And if the worst fall she shall be my physick. Lets go then, and a merry winde be with us. Mal. Captaine your shooes are old, pray put 'em off, And let one fling 'em after us; be bold sirs, And howosever our fortune fals, lets beare An equall burden; if there be an odde lash, Wee'l part it afterwards. La-p. I am arm'd at all points. Exeunt Enter foure serving in a Banquet. 1. Then my Lady will have a bedfellow to night. 2. So she sayes, heaven what a danty armefull shall he enjoy that has the launching of her, what a fight shee'l make. 3. I mary boyes, there will be sport indeed, there will be grapling, she has a murderer lies in her prow, I am affraid will fright his maine mast Robin. 4. Who dost thou think shall have her of thy conscience, thou art a wise man. 3. If she go the old way, the way of lot, the longest cut sweeps all without question? 1. She has lost a friend of me else; what think yee of the Courtier. 2. Hang him hedgehogge, h'as nothing in him but a piece of Euphues, and twenty dozen of twelve penny riband all about him, he is but one Pedlers shop of gloves and garters, pickteeth and pomander. 3. The Courtier! marry God blesse her Steven, she is not mad yet, she knowes that trindle tayle too well, he's crest falne, and pinbuttock't, with leaping Landresses. 4. The Merchant sure shee will not be so base to have him. 1. I hope so Robin, hee'l sell us all to the Moors to make mummy; nor the Captaine. 4. Who Potgun, that's a sweet youth indeed, will he stay thinke ye? 3. Yes, without question, and have half din'd too ere the grace be done; he's good for nothing in the world but eating, lying and sleeping; what other men devour in drink, he takes in Pottage, they say has bin at Sea, a Herring fishing, for without doubt he dares not hayle an Ele-boate, ith way of War. 2. I think so, they would beate him off with Butter. 3. When he brings in a prize, unlesse it be Cockles, or Callis sand to scoure with, I'le renounce my five mark a year, and all the hidden art I have in carving, to teach young Birds to whistle Walsingham; leave him to the lime boates; now, what think you of the brave Amiens? 1. That's a thought indeed. 2. I marry ther's a person fit to feed upon a dish so danty, and hee'l do't I warrant him ith nick-boyes, has a body world without end. 4. And such a one my Lady will make no little off; but is not Montague married to day? 3. Yes faith, honest Montague must have his bout too. 2. Hee's as good a lad as ever turnd a trencher; must we leave him? 3. Hee's to good for us Steven, I'le give him health to his good luck to night ith old Beaker, and it shall be sack too. 4. I must have a Garter; and boyes I have bespoke, a a Posset, some body shall give me thanks for't, 'tas a few toyes in't will rase commotions in a bed lad. 1. Away; my Lady. Exeunt Enter Orleance, and his Lady arme in arme, Amiens, Lamira, Charlote, like a Bride, Montague brave, Laverdine, Longavile Dubois, Mallycorn, La-Poope. Lam. Stur your selves noble Lords and Gentlemen, You know your places; many royall welcomes I give your grace; how lovely shewes this change? My house is honor'd in this reconcilement. Orl. Thus Madam must you do, my Lady now shall see You made a Woman; And give you some short lessons for your voyage. Take her instructions Lady, she knowes much. Lam. This becomes you sir. La. My Lord must have his will. Orl. Tis all I can do now sweet heart, faire Lady; This to your happy choyce brother Amiens, You are the man I meane it to. Ami. I'le pledge you. Orl. And with my heart. Ami. With all my love I take it. Lam. Noble Lords I am proud ye have done this day, so much content, and me such estimation that this hour (In this poor rouse) shall be a league for ever, For so I know ye mean it. Ami. I do Lady. Orl. And I my Lord. Omnes. Y'ave done a work of honor. Ami. Give me the Cup, where this health stops, let That man be either very sick, or very simple; Or I am very angry; sir, to you; Madam me thinks this Gentleman might sit to; He would become the best on's. Orl. Pray sit down sir, I know the Lady of the feast expects not this day so much old custom. Lam. Sit down Mountague; nay never blush for the matter. Mon. Noble Madam, I have too reasons against it, and I dare not; duty to you first, as you are my Lady, and I your poorest servant; next the custome of this dayes ceremony. Lam. As you are my servant, I may command you then. Mon. To my life Lady. Lam. Sit down, and here, i'le have it so. Ami. Sit down man, never refuse so faire a Ladies offer. Mont. It is your pleasure Madam, not my pride, And I obey; ile pledge yee now my Lord, Mounsier Longavile. Lon. I thank you sir. Mon. This to my Lady, and her faire choyce to day, and happinesse. Lon. Tis a faire health, i'le pledge you though I sinke for't. Lam. Montague you are too modest; come i'le adde a little more wine t'ee, 'twill make you merry, this to the good I wish.— Mont. Honord Lady, I shall forget my selfe with this great bounty. Lami. You shall not sir; give him some Vine. Ami. By heaven you are a worthy woman, and that Man is blest can come neer such a Lady. Lami. Such a blessing wet weather washes. Mont. At all, I will not go a lip lesse my Lord. Orl. Tis well cast sir. Mal. If Montague get more Wine, we are like to heare on't. Lav. I do not like that sitting there. Mal. Nor I, me thinks he looks like a Judge. La-p. Now have I a kinde a grudging of a beating on me, I fear my hot fit. Mal. Drink apace, ther's nothing allays a cudgell like it. Lami. Montague, now I'le put my choyce to you; who do you hold in all this honor'd company a husband fit to enjoy thy Lady? speak directly. Mont. Shall I speak Madam? Lami. Montague, you shall. Mont. Then as I have a soule i'le speak my conscience, Give me more wine, in vino veritas, Here's to my self, and Montague have a care. Lami. Speak to th'cause. Mont. Yes, Madam; first i'le begin to thee. Lav. Have at us. La-p. Now for a Psalme of mercy. Mont. You good Mounsier, you that bely the noble Name of Courtier, and think your claime good here, hold up your hand; your VVorship is endited here, for a vaine glorious foole. Lav. Good, oh sir. Mont. For one whose wit Lies in a ten pound wastcoat, yet not warme; Ye have travel'd like a Fidler to make faces, And brought home nothing but a case of tooth-picks. You would be married, and no lesse then Ladies, And of the best sort can serve you; thou silke worm What hast thou in thee to deserve this woman? Name but the poorest piece of man, good manners, Ther's nothing sound about thee, faith thou'ast none, It lies pawn'd at thy silke mans, for so much lace; Thy credit which is worse cannot redeem it, Thy cloaths are all the soule thou hast, for so Thou sav'st them hansome for the next great tilting Let who wil take the t'other, thou wert never christen'd Upon my conscience (but in barbers water) Thou art never out o'th basen, thou art rotten, And if thou darst tell truth, thou wilt confesse it; —thy skin Looks of a Chestnut colour, greas'd with Amber All women that on earth do dwell thou lov'st, Yet none that understand love thee again, But those that love the Spittle, get thee home Poor painted butter fly, thy summers pa'st; Go sweat and eat dry Mutton, thou mayst live To do so well yet; a bruis'd Chamber Maide May fall upon thee, and advance thy follies. You have your sentence; now it followes Captaine, I treat of you. La-p. Pray God I may deserve it. Orl. Beshrow my heart he speaks, plaine. Ami. That's plain dealing. Mont. You are a rascall Captaine. La-p. A fine calling. Mont. A water coward. Ami. He would make a prety stuffe. Mont. Nay I speak freely Madam. Lami. Her's none ties you. Mont. Why should'st thou dare come hither with a thought To finde a wife here fit for thee? are all Thy single money whores that fed on Carrots, And fild the high grasse with familiars Falne of to footmen? prethee tell me truly, For now I know thou dar'st not lie, couldst thou not Wish thy selfe beaten well with all thy heart now, And out of paine? say that I broke a rib, Or cut thy nose off, wert not mercifull for this ambition? La-p. Do your pleasure sir, beggars must not be choosers. Orl. He longs for beating. Mon. But that I have nobler thoughts possesse my soule, Then such brown bisket, such a peice of dog-fish, Such a most mangy Mackrell eater as thou art That dares do nothing that belongs toth'Sea, But spue, and catch rats, and fear men of war, Though thou hast nothing in the world to loose Abord thee, but one piece of beefe, one Musket Without a cock for peace sake, and a pitch barrell, I'le tell thee if my time were not more pretious Then thus to loose it, I would rattle thee, It may be beat thee, and thy pure fellow, The Merchant there of Catskins, till my words, Or blowes, or both, made ye two branded wretches To all the world hereafter; you would faine to Venture your bils of lading for this Lady; What would you give now for her? some five frayle Of rotten Figs good, Godson, would you not sir? Or a Parrat that speaks high Dutch? can all thou ever saw'st Of thine own fraughts from Sea, or cosonage (At which thou art as expert as the devill) Nay sell thy soul for wealth to, as thou wilt do, Forfeit thy friends, and raise a mint of Money, Make thee dream all these double could procure A kisse from this good Lady? can'st thou hope She would lie with such a nook of hell as thou art, And hatch young Merchant-furies? oh ye dog-bolts That fear no God but Dunkirks, I shall see you Serve in a lowsy Lime boat, ere I die, For mouldy cheese and butter Billingsgate Would not endure, or bring in rotten Pippins To cure blew eyes, and swear they came from China. Lami. Vex 'em no more, alas they shake: Mont. Down quickly on your marrow bones and thank this Lady. I would not leave you thus else, there are blankets, And such delights for such knaves; but fear still; 'Twill be revenge enough, to keep you waking. Ye have no minde of Marriage, ha' ye? La-p. Surely no great mind now. Mont. Nor you. Mal. Nor I, I take it. Mont. Two eager sutors. Lav. Troth tis wonderous hot, God blesse us from him Lami. You have told me Montague Who are not fit to have me, let me know The man you would point out for me. Mont. There he sits; my Lord of Amiens, Madam, is my choyce, hee's noble every way, and worthy a wife with all the dowries of— Ami. Do you speak sir out of your friendship to me? Mont. Yes, my Lord, and out of truth, for I could never flatter. Ami. I would not say how much I owe you for it, For that were but a promise, but Ile thank ye, As now I find you, in despite of fortune, A faire and noble Gentleman. Lami. My Lords I must confesse the choyce this man hath made Is every way a great one, if not too great, And no way to be slighted: yet because We love to have our own eyes, sometimes now Give me a little liberty to see, How I could fit my selfe, if I were put to't. Ami. Madam we must. Lami. Are yee all agreed? Omnes. We be? Lami. Then as I am a maid, I shall choose here. Montague, I must have thee. Mont. Why Madam I have learnt to suffer more then you can (out of pitty) mock me with this way especially. Lami. Thou think'st I jest now; But by the love I bear thee, I will have thee. Mont. If you could be so weak, to love a falne man, He must deserve more then I ever can, Or ever shall (deer Lady;) look but this way Upon that Lord and you will tell me then Your eyes are no true choosers of good men. Ami. Do you love him truely? Lam. Yes my Lord, I will obey him truly, for I'le marry him, and justly thinke he that has so well serv'd mee with his obedience being borne to greatnesse, must use mee nobly of necessity when I shall serve him. Ami. 'Twere a deepe sin to crosse ye, noble Montague, I wish ye all content, and am as happy In my friends good as it were meerly mine. Mont. Your Lordship does ill to give up your right; I am not capable of this great goodnesse, There sits my wife that holds my troth. Cha. I'le end all, I wooed you for my Lady, and now give up my title, alas poor wench, my aimes are lower far. Mont. How's this sweet heart? Lami. Sweet heart tis so, the drift was mine to hide My purpose till it struck home. Omnes. God give you joy. Lami. Prethee leave wondring, by this kisse i'le have thee. Mont. Then by this kisse, and this i'le ever serve ye. Long. This Gentleman and I sir must needs hop once more to follow yee. Mont. As friends and fellows, never as servants more. Long., Dub. You make us happy. Orl. Friend Montague, ye have taught mee so much honor, I have found a fault in my self but thus I'le purge my conscience of it, the late land I took by false play, from you with as much Contrition, and entirenesse of affection to this most happy day again, I render; be Master of your own, for get my malice, and make mee worthy of your love, L. Montague. Mont. You have won me and honor to your name. Mal. Since your Lordship has begun good deeds, wee'l follow; good sir forgive us, we are now those men fear you for goodnes sake; those sums of money unjustly we detaine from you, on your pardon shall bee restord again, and we your servants. La-p. You are very forward sir, it seems you have money, I pray you lay out, i'le pay you or pray for you, as the Sea works. Lav. Their pennance sir i'le undertake, so please ye To grant me on concealement. Long. Right courtier, still a begging. Mont. What is it sir? Lav. A Gentlewoman. Mont. In my gift? Lav. Yes sir, in yours. Mont. Why bring her forth and take her. Lami. What wench would he have? Mont. Any wench I think. Enter Laverdine and Veramour, like a Woman. Lav. This is the Gentlewoman. Mont. 'Tis my Page sir. Uer. No sir, I am a poor disguis'd Lady? That like a Page have followed you full long for love god-wot. Omnes. A Lady—Laverdine—yes, yes, tis a Lady. Mont. It may be so, and yet we have laine together, But by my troth I never found her, Lady. L Orl. Why wore you boyes cloathes? Vir. I'le tell you Madam, I took example by 2 or 3. playes, that methought Concernd me. Mont. Why made you not me acquainted with it. Ver. Indeed sir I knew it not my selfe, Untill this Gentleman opend my dull eyes, And by perswasion made me see it. Ami. Could his power in words make such a change? Uer. Yes, as truly woman as your selfe my Lord. Lav. Why but hark you, are not you a woman? Ver. If hands and face make it not evident, you shall see more. Mal. Breeches, breeches, Laverdine. La-p. Tis not enough, women may wear those cases. Search further Courtier. Omnes. Ha, ha, ha. La-p. Oh thou freshwater Gudgeon, wouldst thou come To point of Marriage with an Ignoramus? Thou shouldst have had her urin to the doctors, The foolishest Phisitian could have made plaine The liquid Epicæne; a blind man by the hand Could have discoverd the ring from the stone. Boy, come, to Sea with me, ile teach thee to climb, And come down by the rope, nay to eate Rats. Ver. I shall devour my Master before the prison then, Sir, I have began my Trade. Mal. Trade? to the Citie child, a flatcap will become thee. Mont. Gentlemen I beseech you molest your selves no further, For his preferment it is determin'd. Lav. I am much ashamed, and if my cheek Gives not satisfaction, break my head. Mont. Your shame's enough sir. Ami. Montague, much joy attend thy marriage Bed; By thy example of true goodnesse, envie is exil'd, And to all honest men that truth intend, I wish good luck, faire fate be still thy friend. Exeunt.

      <field name="fulltext">Vpon an Honest Mans Fortune. By Mr. John Fletcher. You that can look through Heaven, and tell the Stars, Observe their kind conjunctions, and their wars; Find out new lights, and give them where you please, To those men honors, pleasures, to those ease; You that are Gods surveyers, and can show How far, and when, and why the wind doth blow; Know all the charges of the dreadfull thunder, And when it will shoot over, or fall under: Tell me, by all your art I conjure ye, Yes, and by truth, what shall become of me? Find out my star, if each one, as you say, Have his peculiar Angel, and his way; Observe my fate, next fall into your dreames, Sweep clean your houses, and new line your sceames, Then say your worst: or have I none at all? Or is it burnt out lately? or did fall? Or am I poor, not able, no full flame? My star, like me, unworthy of a name? Is it, your art can only work on those That deale with dangers, dignities, and cloaths? With love, or new opinions? you all lye, A fishwife hath a fate, and so have I, But far above your finding; he that gives, Out of his providence, to all that lives, And no man knowes his treasure, no not you: He that made Egypt blind, from whence you grew Scaby and lowsy, that the world might see Your calculations are as blind as ye, He that made all the stars, you dayly read, And from thence filtch a knowledge how to feed; Hath hid this from you, your conjectures all Are drunken things, not how, but when they fall; Man is his own star, and the soule that can Render an honest, and a perfect man Command all light, all influence, all fate, Nothing to him fals early or too late. Our acts our Angels are, or good or ill, Our fatall shadowes that walke by us still, And when the stars are labouring, we believe Jt is not that they govern, but they grive For stubborn ignorance; all things that are Made for our generall uses are at war, Even we among our selves, and from the strife Your first unlike opinions got a life. O man, thou image of thy makers good, What canst thou fear, when breath'd into thy blood His spirit is, that built thee? what dull sence Makes thee suspect, in need, that providence? Who made the morning, and who plact the light Guid to thy labours? who cal'd up the night, And bid her fall upon thee, like sweet showers In hollow murmurs, to lock up thy powers? Who gave thee knowledge, who so trusted thee, To let thee grow so neer himselfe, the Tree? Must he then be distrusted? shall his frame Discourse with him, why thus, and thus I am? He made the Angels thine, thy fellowes all, Nay even thy servants, when devotions call. Oh canst thou be so stupid then, so dim, To seek a saving influence, and loose him? Can Stars protect thee? or can poverty, Which is the light to Heaven, put out his eye? He is my star, in him all truth I find, All influence, all fate, and when my mind Is furnished with his fullnesse, my poor story Shall outlive all their Age, and all their glory. The hand of danger cannot fall amisse, When I know what, and in whose power it is. Nor Want, the cause of man, shall make me groan, A holy hermit is a mind alone. Doth not experience teach us all we can To work our selves into a glorious man? Love's but an exhalation to best eyes The matter spent, and then the fooles fire dyes? Were I in love, and could that bright star bring Increase to wealth, honour, and every thing: Were she as perfect good as wee can aime, The first was so, and yet she lost the Game. My mistris then be knowledge and faire truth; So I enjoy all beauty and all youth, And though to time her lights and lawes she lends, She knowes no Age that to corruption bends. Friends promises may lead me to believe, But he that is his own friend knowes to live. Affliction when J know it is but this, A deep allay whereby man tougher is To bear the hammer, and the deeper still, We still arise more image of his will. Sicknesse an humorous cloud twixt us and light, And Death, at longest but another night. Man is his own Star, and that soule that can Be honest is the only perfect man. FINIS.</field>
