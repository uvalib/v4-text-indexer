      <field name="fulltext">Actus. I. Enter Master Wilding, and Mistris Penelope. Wild. What neede you be so coy now? Pen. Pray collect Your selfe, remember what you are, and whose You have a vertuous gentlewoman, thinke Upon your faith to her. Wi. Thinke of a Fiddle-sticke. While you put me in minde of what I am, You quite forget your selfe: my wife I allow Your kinswoman farre off, to whom a widdow Your father left you, with a handsome fortune, Which by her marriage, I have in possession, And you too; therefore as you hope to be In due time worth a husband, thinke upon't: I can deserve respect, then wisely use me, As you would keepe me. Pene. This is but a triall Of my strength, for I know you have more charity, (Should I consent) then Ship-wracke your owne honor. But take heede sir, how you proceede to jest With frailty, least too much disordering Your good thoughts, you forget and by degrees, Loose your owne innocence. Wi. I jest? you'ld have me sweare, and yet you should not thinke it such a wonder: to love: come, shake off this frost, it spoiles thee; your nature should be soft, and flexible; perhaps thou thinkst, I doe not love thee hartily, I know not how to give thee better testimony, then by offering my selfe to thee: if my wife die, as tenn to one shee's not immortall, we may couple tother way. Pene. What argument is this to assure the truth of your affection to me, that breake your vowes to her? Wi. Oh! great argument, and you observe: she was a widdow when I married her, thou art a yong maide; and handsome. Pene. Can you be so ingratefull, to punish whom you should reward, remember sir, shee brought you that wealth you have. tooke you from nothingâ Wi. Ther's reason then for nothing I should love her: hang her estate, I was held a proper man, and in that point, deserv'd her, and shee had millions: and I were free againe, I would not draw i'th teame of marriage for ten subsidyes, not to command a Province. Pene. Yet you said, were your wife dead you'd marry me. Wi. Onely thee, and no body else. Pene. 'Twere dangerous to have many. Wi. To have one, is little lesse then madnes; come, wo't promise? Enter Mistris Wilding. Pene. What? Wi. A course, you know my meaning. Mi. I doe not like this whispering, why with her So close in parly? Wi. Wo't thou doe this feate for me? 'Tis finish'd in a paire of minuts. Pene. Yes, upon one condition. Wi. What condition? Pe. That your wife give consent, you shall then command me. Wi. I'le undertake to goe a pilgrimage To Ierusalem, and returne sooner: wood I did not love thee, love thee infinitely, That's all, 'two not doeâMy wife, I hope. Exit Pene. Shee has not cav's-dropd, us; what pitty tis She cannot finde the way to Heaven; I should not Trouble her in hast, these wives will have no conscience, But sticke to us everlastingly. Now Lady, How did your monkey rest last night, you looke As you had not done your prayers yet, I wonot disturbe you. Mi. Pray sir stay, let me but know Some reason why you use me thus unkindly? If I have beene gilty of offence, I am not Past hope, but with the knowledge of my error, 'Tis possible I may amend, and please you. Wi. I doe not like you. Mi. You did marrie me. Wi, Yes, I did marrie you; her's too much record for't, I would there were a Parson to unmarry us, If any of our Clergie had that faculty, He might repaire the old, and build as many New Abbeyes through the Kingdome in a twelue month. Shall I speake truth? I never much affected thee, I married thee for thy soules sake, not thy body, And shall as soone get children on't: and yet I doe not hate thee, witnesse, I dare kisse, Hold thee by the hand, and sleepe in the same house, And in thy bed sometimes, something ha's beene done. Mi. Within the memorie of man, butâ What sir? Wi. You have a scurvy quality wife, I told you on't. Mi. Once more, and I'le correct it. Wi. You are given to be jealous, I cannot Ramble abroad in gentlemens company Whole dayes, ly out a nights, but you suspect I am wanton, 'tis ill done, it becomes no modest Woman: that loves her husband, to be jealous, What e're she see, or heares, mend, mend this fault, You doe not know, how it may worke upon me. Some wife will bid her husbands leverets welcome, Keepe house together, and provide cleane sheets, And cullices to fortifie; you neere did it: Know her owne Chamber and not come forth Till she be sent for; if her husband kisse her, Sometimes, allow her clothes and other trinkets, Suffer her carve at Table, she is satisfied, And none o'th parish talke, she carries it So handsomlie: these moralls I have read Before now, but you put them not in practise, Nor for ought I perceive, have disposition too't, Therefore i'le take my course. Mi. To shew I can Be obedient to my griefes, from this time, sir, I wonot urge with one unwelcome syllable, How much I am neglected, i'le conceale it Too from the world, your shame must needs be mine. I see you doe not love me, where your heart Hath plac'd a worthier thought, let it dwell ever, Freely persue your pleasures, I will have No passion that shall mutinie, you are, And shall be Lord of me still. Wi. I like this, if it be no disguise. Mi. Do not suspect me, I would sweare by a kisse, if you vouchsafe it, You shall not keepe a servant, that shall be more humble. Wi. And obedient to my will? Mi. In all things. Wi. But if I bring home a mistresse? Mi. I'le call her sister. Wi. What if there be one Already, that does please me, will you not Repine, and looke awry upon's, when we Make much of one another? Mi. So you will but sometimes smile on me too, i'le indeavour. Wi. Well said, this may doe good upon me, as I finde you prompt in this, I may consider Other matters: to tell you true, I love Your kinswoman. Mi. How? Wi. I'th way you wot on, but I finde her cold and peevish, how she maie Be brought about I know not, 'twould shew well, And be a president for other wives, If you would put your helpe too't. Mi. Goodnes blesse me. Wi. One woman with another can doe more In such a cause, then twentie men. I doe not Wander, you see, out of the blood, this will Be a way to justifie your obedience. Mi. You shew a tyrant now, and stead of framing My soule to patience, murder both. Exit. Wi. I have gone too farre a conscience; this may Spoile all, and now I thinke upon't, I was A coxcombe to discover any party, I must deny't againe, and carry things More closelie. How now Will? Enter Hazard. Ha. How now Will?'s that all? Looke up, and aske me a question like a man, What melancholy? Wi. No, no; a toy, a trifle, Ha. That should be a woman, who'st thou art thinking on? I have beene of your counsell. Wi. I was thinking, o' my Wifeâ Ha. I met her sadd. Wi. I cannot blame her; We have had a dialogue; come, thou know'st my bosome, Ha. when do'st meane to lie with her? Wi. I know not, but I have offer'd faire conditions: Shee is very confident, I doe not dote Upon her beauty, I have told her, sirra, I love her kinswoman. Ha. Y'are not so mad. Wi. The worlds deceav'd in her, sheele give me leave, To ramble where I list, and feede upon What best delights my appetite. Ha. He that has An ambition to be strangled in his sleepe, May tell his wife he loves another woman. Wi. But I was not content with this, because The other wench was somewhat obstinate, I must needs urge my wife, to mollifie And mold her, for my purpose. Ha. And she consented too? Wi. No 'twould not doe. This went against her stomacke and we parted. Ha. Next time you see her, looke to be presented With your mistresses nose for this, do'st thinke a woman Can be so patient, to know her rivall I'th same roofe, and leave her eyes, to see thee Agen? I am sorry for thee. Wi. I am confident Shee dare not: but for all that, would I had Beene lesse particular. Ha. Come, I love thee well, But not thy wit, to carry things no handsomer: You must unravell agen, and make your wife Beleeve you did but try her. How now, what's the newes here? Enter Officers with Delamore wounded. 1 Off. Quickly to a Surgeon, beare him gently. Ha. What's the businesse. 2 Off. Nothing, sir, but a gentleman is kild, and we are Carrying him to a Surgeon. Wi. Tis Jacke Delamore, he is not dead. Ha. Who hurt him? Ha. Master Beamont; we cannot stay, sir. Wi. Why they were friends. 2 Off. But wine made them fall out, some say, about Their Mistresses. Wi. I did expect a woman at one end on't. What miserable fooles are men, to kill One another for these Cockatrices! Ha. I am sorry for poore Beamont. Wi. It would be long ere any mistresse would Be so desperate for her servant, this is valur, High and mighty valor. Ha. Men must preserve Their honors man, thou dost not know their quarrell? Wi. Thou art held a peece of a kill-Cow too, looke too't before the sessions take an order w'ee: ist not a great deale safer, now to skermish with a Peticote, and touze a handsome wench in private; then be valiant in the streets, and kisse the Gallowes for't? hang, hang this foolerie, let gentlemen rather live, and pay their Tailors, then let their clothes enrich the hangmans wardrobe. Ha. But skermishing as you call it, with the Peticote, Is by some, held away to this preferment, Your wenches ha beene sticklers, and some men Dropt in their quarrell. Wi. Let them be such coxcombs They cannot die too soone; cannot I have A Lady of pleasure, but to please her humour, I must be engag'd to fight and kill men for her? Because her healths refus'd, anothers nose Or teeth preferrd, substantiall grounds for murder, We spend our blood too much another way; Consumption take me, if I fight for one on 'em, I will drinke single beere first, and live honest, Gentlemen are come to a fine passe, doe not you Thinke but tis possible, I may fight for all this? Ha. There may be causes, that have women in 'em, But I confesse, no polecats, or lewd strumpets, Though I doe use the tricke o'th flesh, shall drive Me to the Surgeon; I had a mother. Wi. And I have a wife, would thou had'st her. Ha. No, No, she is well as shee is, There may be honor to defend these. Wi. Sometimes Ha. But ther's a mischiefe greater then all these A base and sorded provocation, Us'd among gentlemen, they cannot quarrell About a glasse of Wine, but out flies streight Sonne of a whore, dead mothers must be torne, Out of their graves, or living, have their names Poysoned by a prodigious breath: it were A brave and noble Law, to make this tongue Be cut for't, it wod save much blood ith yeere, That might be spent more honorablie. Wi. The lie grew a dull provocation, this has quickn'd us, but leave this common place, thou canst not helpe it, letts talke of something else. Stay is not this Beaumont? Enter Beaumont, and Officers. Ha. Apprehended, alas poore gentleman; how now Ned? Bea. As you see gentlemen, cald to my account. Wi. We heard a peece of the misfortune, but Be not dejected, he may live. Bea. I feare it. Pray lead me where you please, alas. Violante! this newes will wound thee too. Exit. Wi. I'le with him, and know the story. Ha. Twill but trouble me; I can doe him no service, beside that, I am engag'd to meete old Master Barnacle. Enter Acre-lesse, Little-stocke, and Sell-away. Whither, whither Gentlemen, with your swords drawne? Acr. Doest not see a gentleman led to Prison? Wee'le reskue him from the Offcers, come joyne with us: We shall draw more to the cause. Ha. You doe not meane this rashnes; hide your swords, be advis'd better; D'ee know his fact? Lit. He has slaine a gentleman. Sel. They say he is not dead, the wounds not mortall. Ha. And will you make one past cure? Acr. How do'st meane? Ha. Upon your selves, coole your hot bloods a little, No mutuny my countrymen, remember, If he recover that is hurt, the tother Will come off well enough, without your volour: Breath, breath a while, you may if you have a minde too't Instead of reskuing, betray a gentleman, And your selves too, to a danger. Lit. He sayes right. Ha. Tis scurvey wearing hempe, if you scape killing, There be more butchers then sell flesh; and Citizens Have no mercy in their Clubs, especially When gentlemen have so litle wit, to bring There heads to 'th knocking downe, 'tis a revenge They owe you for their wives, oh take heede mainely Of these left handed Halberdiers. Acr. Confound 'em. Ha. How many will you kill with your bird-spit? You have more leggs and armes at home, which makes You valiant, i'le not pare my nailes to day, And yet I love my friend, as the best on you; You know I dare fight too, but in this cause You must needs pardon me, I beleeve the stoutest That now would seeme all fire, and sword, will goe With as ill will to hanging, as another, And will becom't as scurvily, take your courses. Sel. I thinke 'tis better: Ha. O'th two, to go to the Taverne, and be drunke In your owne defence, a wench is not so dangerous Nor the Disease that waites upon her. Acr. What if the gentleman that's hurt should die? Then ther's no hope for tother. Ha. Lesse for you, You would be guilty of his murther too, And snatch him from the Law, why you may doo't: Tis pity but the government should thanke you, And if you scape the halter for't, it may be Another man in time, may cut your throate, And ther's one for another, paid in the blood. Come be your selves, these are not acts of gentlemen, Where shame, not honor must reward your daring, Though we be wild, it followes not we should Be mad out-right. Lit. I was ever of his minde. Acr.

But I have a father, and remembring him A sorrow steales upon me, to betraie My hopes of blessing; for although hee love me, And deerelie as he sayes, for Children must not Dispute with fathers, he affects not him In whom I place all thoughts that can delight me, He loves not Delamore, and what to me Is all the World without him? I shall never I feare, have his consent to be made happie In marriage, and this, although our thoughts Reflect with equall honor on our lovers, Makes the distinction, and concludes me miserable, Thy will depends upon no riged parent, Thy path is strew'd with Roses, while I clime A ragged cliffe, to meete whom I affect.

Leo. What sir? Hu. They are more then he deserv'd, and yet tis better Thou shouldst bestow thy teares upon his Funerall, Then I sigh'd at thy marriage; come, Heaven has Beene kinde in this divorce, preparing thus Thy better fortune, and preserving mine, I am sorrie for the gentleman that kild him. Leo. Oh Murderer. Hu. You are a foole, and know not His provocation: in my youthfull dayes, I was not patient when affronts were offred me, Nothing more decre to gentlemen, then honor. Leo. Honor in murder? Hu. This was otherwise: In my owne defence I would kill a family, He shew'd his generous spirit, all the towne Speakes noblie of him, pity him, and pray for him, And were he not desertfull, by this time The generall vote had hang'd him. Leo. Oh, my fate! Hu. Tother a loose, and inconsiderate man, Lost in estate, and would ha married thee, To ha squees'd mine, 'tis better as it is. Leo. Good sir, be charitable to the dead. Hu. Be you first charitable to the living. Speake well, and thinke so too, you do not know What benefit may follow, and how ere Your womanish sorrow for the present may So mist your eyes, they will hereafter open, To see, and thanke my care. Leo. Indeede your language, Pardon my boldnesse, sir, is darke and mysticall. Hu. You have your wit to apprehend sometimes, But 'tis not passion must excuse your dutie to me. Leo. I hope. Hu. Your hopes may faile you if you doe, Be obedient hereafter, if you please, And love my directions Leo. I'le not have A thought shall disobey you, and if ever I love agen. Hu. If ever? why suppose I should propound one to you, now i'th heate Of this misfortune, can your heart be obstinate To me, and your owne good? Leo. This is too soone A conscience, sir, before his blood be cold, To whom I profest love, to like another? The World would much condemne me. Hu. Is the World Or I to be prefer'd, this makes the act Of your obedience perfect, and because I'le have assurance of what power I hold, This minute i'le preferre one to your thoughts, Dispose your heart to love the gentleman That now's in Prison. Leo. Whom d'ee meane deere sir? Hu. He that kild Delamore, Master Beaumont: Doe not suspect I trifle, he is of A noble house, of a faire expectation, Handsome in every part. Leo. Shall not hee suffer For the blacke deede alreadie done? Hu. Compose Your selfe to love him, i'le finde a waie how to Secure his life, and bring him freelie off. Leo. Oh! consider ere you move to farr; If having slaine my comfort, for I must Give it no other name, call not your justice To my revenge, yet let me not be forc'd, To have a thought so full of shame to women, That he should be my husband, 'tis a staine Time nor repentance can wash off, I know You cannot meane so cruellie, beside I shall commit a sinne, foule as his murther, Upon poore Violante, and rob her: Their heart's love hath seald up i'th eye of Heaven, 'Twere sacriledge to part em, shee's my friend too, One that will rather die then injure me. And he will rather suffer, if he be Noble as you professe him, then consent to So foule a guilt. Hu. Let me alone for that, If he refuse this offer for his life, Why let him die, i'le put him too't, consider, In this I shall behold thy naked soule, Be rul'd, and prosper; disobey, and be Throwne from my care and blood, at better leasure I'le tell you more. Exit. Leo. Has Heaven no pity for me? What killing language doth a father speake? Poore hart prevent more greife, and quickly breake. Exit,</field>

To say the truth I have shewed my selfe a coxcombe. A pox a play that made me double looser. For ought I know, she may admit me never To such a turne agen, and then I ha punished My selfe ingeniouslie. Enter Mistris Wilding, Penelope, and Mistris Leonora, a Servant waiting upon them. My wife. Pag. My Mistresse, sir. Wi. Keepe you at distance, Penelope, and Leonora, Shee's as the boy reported something more Pleasant then ordinarie. Mi. Tis hee good cozen, Pretend some busines, offer at some wares, Or aske the Gold-smith what your Diamond's worth, Something to trifle time away, while I Speake with my husband a few words. Wi. Shee comes toward me. Mi. I can containe no longer. How d'ee sweete-hart? Wi. Well, but a little melancholy. You looke more sprightfully wife, something has pleas'd you. Mi. It has indeede, and if it be no staine To modestie, I would enquire how you Sped the last night. Wi. I loft my money. Mi. I doe not meane that gaine. Wi. I am not betrai'd I hope; do not meane that game? Mi. Y'are a fine gentleman. Wi. Tis so, could she not keepe her owne counsell? Mi. And have behav'd your selfe most wittilie, And I may say most wrongfully: this will Bee much for your honor, when 'tis knowne. Wi. What will be knowne? Mi. Do you not blush? oh fie. Is there no modestie in man? Wi. What riddle Have you got now? I wonot yet seeme conscious. Mi. Tis time then to be plaine, it was a wonder I could be so long silent, did you like Your last nights lodging? Wil. Very, very well; I went not to bed all night. Mi. You did not lie with Mistresse Penelope my kinswoman? Wi. Refuse me if I did. Mi. You neede not sweare; But 'twas no fault of yours, no fault no vertue: But 'tis no place to expostulate these actions. In breife know 'twas my plott, for I observ'd Which way your warme affection mov'd, &amp; wrought So with my honest cozen to supplie Her wanton place, that with some shame at last, I might deceive your hard heart into kindnes. Wi. That, that agen sweete wife, and be a little Serious; was it your plott to excuse your cozen, And be the bed-fellow? Mi. Heaven knowes 'tis truth. Wi. I am fitted, fitted with a paire of hornes Of my owne making. Mi. Thanke, and thinke upon That providence that would not have you lost In such a Forrest of loose thoughts, and bee Your selfe agen; I am your hand-maid still, And have learned so much pietie to conceale What ever should dishonor you. Wi. It budds, It budds alreadie. I shall turne starke mad, Horne mad. Mi. What aile you? are you vext because Your wantonnesse thriv'd so well? Wi. Well with a vengeance. Mi. I did expect your thanks. Wi. Yes, I do thanke you, thanke you heartilie, Most infinitly thanke you. Mi. Doth this merit No other payment but your scorne, then know Bad man, 'tis in my power to be reveng'd, And what I had a resolution Should sleepe in silent darknes, now shall looke Day in the face, i'le publish to the World How I am wrong'd, and with what stubbornesse You have despis'd the cure of your owne fame; Nor shall my Cozen suffer in her honor. I stoope as low as earth to shew my dutie, But too much trampl'd on I rise to tell The World I am a woman. VVi. No, no; harke you, I doe not mocke you, I am taken with The conceit, what a fine thing I have made my selfe. Nere speake on't, thy device shall take; i'le love thee, And kisse thee for't, tha'st paid me handsomelie: An admirable plot, and follow'd cunninglie, I'le see thee anon agen, and lie with thee To night, without a stratagemme. The gentlewomen Expect thee; keepe all close, deare wife, no sentences. I am trick'd and trim'd at my owne charges rarely, I'le seeke out some body agen. Exit. Mi. I have presum'd too much upon your patience, I have discover'd, and I hope t'will take. Pene. I wish it may. Mi. You are sad still, Leonora. Remove these thoughts: come i'le waite on you now To the Exchange: some toyes may there strike off Their sad remembrance. Leo. I attend you. Mi. Farewell. Enter Beaumont, and his keeper. Ke. The gentleman that was yesterday to speake with you Is come againe to visite you. Beo. S. Richard Hurry? Ke. The same, sir. Bar. You may admit him. Ke. Men of his quality Do seldome court affliction, this, I must Allow, is a most noble gratitude For those good offices my father did him. Enter Sr. Richard. Hu. Sir, the respects I owe you make me againe Solliciter for your saftie, and although On the first proposition it appeare Strange to you, and perhapps incredible, Which might dispose you to the slow embrace Of what I tendred, yet againe brought to you After a time to examine and consider What most concernes you, I am confident, You will accept, and thanke me. Beo. Noble sir. You doe expresse so rare a bountie, men Will sloely imitate; I am not soe Lost in my wilde misfortune, but my reason Will guide me to acknowledge and paie backe My service and my selfe, for so much charity As you have pleas'd to shew me. Enter Violante. Vio. Here's for thy paines: they are the same; make good Thy word, and place me where I may unseene Heare their discourse. Ke. This way. Beo. But with your pardon, I would desire to heare agen how much I shall be oblig'd that knowing the extent Of your desert I maie pay backe a duty, That may in every circumstance become My fortune and the benefit. Hu. Then thus: you are a Prisoner; that alone Is misery, But yours the greater, in that guilt of blood, Not summes that may bee recompenc'd, detaine you. I'le not dispute the circumstance, Delamore Slaine by your hand. Beo. I have confest, The first jurie having found it murder. Hu. His blood calls to the law for justice, and you cannot Left to your selfe, and looking on the fact, Expect with any comfort what must follow. Yet I in pity of your suffrings, In pity of your youth which would bee else Untimely blasted, offer to remove Your sorrowes, make you free and right againe, With cleere satisfaction to the Law. Beo. Good sir, Pray give me leave to doubt here. I see not How ere your will and charitie may bee active In my desiresse to save me, that you can Assure my life and freedome, since in causes Of such high nature, lawes must have their course: Whose streame as it were wickednesse to pollute, It were vanitie for any private man To thinke he could resist. I speake not this To have you imagine I despise my life, But to expresse my feares your will does flatter you Bove what your power can reach. Fa. For that I urge not My beeing a Commissioner alone To doe you service, I have friends in Court, And great ones, when the rigor of the Law Hath sentenc'd you to mediate your pardon: Nor takes it from the justice of a Prince, Where provocation and not malice makes Guilty, to save, whom the sharpe letter doomes Sometimes to execution: I am to farre From doubting your discharge, that I dare forfeit My life if I secure not yours from any Danger for this offence. Beo. You speake all comfort Which way can I deserve this? Ha. That i'le shew you. I had an obligation to your father Whose love when all my fortunes were i'th ebbe, And desperatelie, releev'd mee with large summes; By whose carefull manage I arryu'd at what I am, and I should be a rebell to Nature and goodnesse not to love the sonne Of such a friend by his misfortune made Ripe for my gratitude. Beo. You speake your bountie, But teach not all this while how to deserve it. Hu. Tis done by your acceptance of my daughter To bee your Bride. Be. To be my Bride? pray tell tell me Is she deform'd or wanton, what vice has shee? Ha. Vice, sir, she will deserve as good a husband, Shee is handsome though I say't, and shall be rich too. Beo. Shee is too good, if she be faire or vertuous. Pardon, I know she is both: but you amaze me, I did expect conditions of danger: A good wife is a blessing above health; You teach mee to deserve my life first from you By offering a happinesse beyond it. Hu. If you finde love to accept, 'tis the reward I looke for, Leonora shall obey Or quit a father. Be. Ha goodnesse defend. I know you doe but mocke me, and upbraid My act, that kild her servant: wound mee still, I have deserv'd her curse: I see her weepe, And every teare accuse me. Hu. May I never Thrive in my Prayers to Heaven, if what I offer I wish not heartilie confirm'd. Bu. I now Suspect you are not Leonora father, 'Twere better you dissembled, then made her So past all hope of beeing cur'd agen: I marry Leonora! can her soule Thinke on so foule a rape, she cannot sure. Ha. Shee shall; I command. Be. By vertue, but Shee shanot, nor would I to graspe an Empire Tempt her to so much staine, let her tell downe Her Virgin teares, on Delamores cold Marble, Sigh to his dust, and call revenge upon His head whose anger sent him to those shades, From whence she nere must see him; this will justifie Shee lov'd the dead: it were impietie One smile should blesse her murderer, and how ere You are pleas'd to complement with my affliction, I know she cannot finde one thought without her So foule to looke upon me. Hu. Let it rest on that, will you consent and timely make provision for your saftie? Beo. For my life You meane, now on the chance, then I may live You are confident, and thinke it not impossible Your daughter may affect me; ther's at once Two blessings, are they not and mightie ones, Considering what I am, how low, how lost T'oth common aire? Hu. Now you are wise. Beo. But if Your daughter would confirme this, and propound Her selfe my victorie. Hu. What then? Beo. I should condemne her, and despise the conquest: These things may bribe an Atheist not a Lover. But you perhaps are ignorant, I have given My faith away irrevocablie, 'tis The wealth of Violante, and I wonot Basely steale backe a thought, and yet I thanke you, I am not so inhumane. Hu. Will you not Preferre your life To honor and religion? Beo. For shame be silent could you make me Lord Of my owne destiny, and that Leonora Had empires for her dower, and courted mee With all the flatteries of life, to quit My vowes to Violante, I would fire Upon her bosome to meete death: Hu. And death You must expect which will take off this braverie. Beo. And I will kisse it, kisse it, like a Bride. Hu. So resolute? Beo. And if I cannot live My Violantes, I will die her sacrifice. Good sir, no more, you do not well to trouble The quiet of a Prisoner, thus that cannot Be a too carefull Steward of those minuts Left him to make his peace, tempt me no further: The Earth is not so fixt as my resolues, Rather to die then in one thought transplant My love from Violante. Hu. Bee undone, And this contempt, shall hasten the divorce Of soule and love, die and be soone forgotten. Exit. Enter Violante. Beo. My Violante, if there can be any joy Neighbour too so much greife, i'le powre it out To pay thy bounteous visit, if my eyes Admit no fellowship in weeping, 'tis Because my heart which saw thee first, would bid Thee welcome thither, scorning to acknowledge There can be any thing but joy where thou art. Vio. But sadnes my deere Beaumont, while there is A cause that makes thee Prisoner, I must weepe And empty many springs, my eyes are now No prophets of thy sorrow but the witnes, And when I thinke of death that waits upon thee I wither to a Ghost. Beo. Why Violante, We must all die, restraine these weeping Fountaines, Keepe 'em till I am dead, dispence 'em then Upon my grave, and I shall grow agen, And in the sweete disguise of a faire Garden Salute the spring that gave mee greene and odour. Why should not love transforme us? Vio. Bee not lost In these imaginations. Beo. Or perhapps 'Thast ambition, she whose love made up A wonder to the World, beside the pledge Of duty to her Lord, fam'd Arthemisia Shall bee no more in storie for her Tombe: For on the Earth that weighes my body downe When I am dead, thy teares by the cold breath Of Heaven congeal'd to Beaumonts memorie, Shall raise a monument of Pearle to out doe The great Mausolus Sepulcher. Vio. No more Of this vaine language, if you have any pittie On the poore Violante. Ber. I ha done, And yet I am going now to a long silence; Allow my sorrow to take leave Violante Vio. It shall be so, be valiant my heart Beaumont I come not to take leave of thee. Be. Perhapps you'le see me agen. Vio. Agen and often, Thy starres are gentle to thee, many daies, And yeeres are yet betweene thee and that time That threatens losse of breath; see, I can thus Disperse the Clouds sate heavie on my brow, Wipe the moisture hence, tis day agen; Take beames into thy eye, and let them sinke Upon thy better fortune, live, live happilie. Be. Is Delamore alive? Vio. Dead and interr'd. Be. From what can this hope rise? Vio. From thy selfe Beaumont; If thou wilt save thy selfe, I have heard all, And by the duty of my love am bound To hide your resolution, can you be So merciles to your selfe to refuse life When it is offer'd with the best advantage Is Leonoras love? a price that should Buy you from all the World? be counsell'd sir, Oh, do not loose your selfe in a vaine passion For thought of me, I cancell all your vowes, And give you backe your heart, bee free againe If you will promise me to live and love. Be. Leonora. Vio. That best of woman-kinde, a mine of sweetnes. Be. But can you leave mee then? Vio. I justifie Thy choice of me in that, that to preserve thee Dare give thee backe agen, be Leonoras, For being mine th'art lost to all the World Better a thousand times, thou be made hers Then we both loose, i'le pawne my faith sheele love thee I'le be content to heare my Beaumonts well, And visite thee sometimes like a glad sister, And never beg a kisse, but if I weepe At any time when we are together, Do not beleeve 'tis sorrow makes my eyes So wet, but joy to see my Beaumont living: As it is now to hope. Be. If thou dost meane thus Thou dost the more to inflame me to be constant, Be not a miracle and I may be tempted To love my life above thee, by this kisse, Oh, give me but another in my death It will restore me by this innocent hand, While as I wish my soule I wonot leave thee For the Worlds Kingdome. Vio. But you must, unlesse You change for Leonora, thinke of that, Thinke ere you be to rash. Be. I'le thinke of thee, And honor to be read, I love Violante But never could deserve her, live thou happie, And by thy vertue teach a neerer way To heaven, we may meete yonder, do not make me More miserable then I am, by adding perjurie To my bloody sinne, the memory of thee Will at my execution advance My spirit to aâthat men shall thinke I have chang'd my cause for martyrdome. Vio. Then here As of a dying man I take my leave, Farewell unhappie Beaumont, i'le pray for thee. Beo. Tis possible I may live yet and be thine. Vio. These teares embalme thee If in this World we never meete My life is buried in thy winding sheete. Beo. This exceeds all my sorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. V. Enter Wilding. Wi. I am justly punish'd now for all my tricks, And pride o'th flesh, I had ambition To make men cuckolds, now the divell has paid me, Paid me i'th same coine, and i'le compare My forehead with the broadest of my neighbors: But ere it spreads too monstrous, I must have Some plot upon this Hazard, he supposes He has enjoy'd Penelope, and my tricke To drive the opinion home, to get him marrie her And make her satisfaction: the wench Has oft commended him, he may be wonne too't, I never meant to part with all her portion, Perhaps heele thanke me for the moytie, And this dispos'd on shee's conjur'd to silence. It must bee so. Enter Hazard. Ha. Jacke Wilding how ist man? How goes the Plough at home? what sayes the Lady Guinever that was humbled in your absence? You have the credit with her, all the glorie Of my nights worke; does shee not hide her eyes, And blush, and cry you are a fine gentleman. Turne a to side, or drop a handkercher, And stoope, and take occasion to leere, And laugh upon thee? Wi. Nothing lesse, I know not What tha'st done to her, but shees very sad. Ha. Sad; i'le be hang'd then. Wi. Thou must imagine I did the best to comfort her. Ha. Shee's melancholy For my absence man, i'le keepe her company Agen to night. Wi. Shee thinks 'twas I enjoy'd her. Ha. Let her thinke whom she will, so we may couple. Wi. And nothing now but sighes, and cries I have Undone her. Ha. Shee's a foole, I hurt her not, Shee cried not out I am sure, and for my body I defie the Colledge of Physitions: Let a jurie of Virgins search me. Wi. To be plaine, Although shee has no thought but I was her bed-fellow, You are the only argument of her sadnes. Ha. How can that be? Wi. When I had merrilie Excus'd what had beene done, she fetch'd a sight, And with some teares reveal'd her love to you, That she had lov'd yon long, but by this act Of mine, d'ee marke, she was become unworthie To hope for so good fortune, I cannot tell, But she is strangelie passionate. Ha. For me? Wi. For you, but thou art soft and tender-hearted, And in that confidence I did forbeare To tell her who had done the deede. Ha. You did so: 'Twas wiselie done, now I collect my selfe, Shee has sometime smil'd upon mee. Wi. Nay beleeve it Shee is taken with thee above all the World. Ha. And yet shee was content you should 'Bove all the World. Wi. But 'twas your better fate To be the man, it was her destiny To have the right performance, thou art a gentleman, And canst not but consider the poore gentlewoman. Ha. What wod'st ha me doe? Wi.

Thanke you heartily, A single life has single care, pray keepe it. Wi. Come thou shalt know I love thee, thou shalt have More by a thousand pound, then I resolv'd To part with cause I wod call thee cozen too; A brace of thousands Will, shee has to her Portion, I hop'd to put her off with halfe the summe; That's truth some yonger brother wod ha thank'd mee, And given my quietus tush, 'tis frequent With men that are so trusted, i'st a match, Ha.

You have made him, sir, so valiant I am afraid He's not long liv'd, he quarrells now with everybody And rores and dominers and shak's the pen-houses. A woman that sold pudding-pies, but tooke The wall on him, and he trips up her heeles, And downe fell all, the kennell ranne pure white-pot What shall I doe I feare he will be kild: I take a little priviledge my selfe Because I threaten to disinherite him, But no body else dares talke or meddle with him Is there no way to take him downe agen And make him coward? Ha. There are wayes to tame him. Ba. Now I wish heartilie you had beaten him For the hundred pound. Ha. That may bee done yet Ba. I'st not to late? but do you thinke 'twill humble him?

Nay 'tis my meaning to content you, sir, And I shall take it as a favour too, If for the same price you made him valiant, You will unblade him: here's the money sir, As waightie gold as tother; cause you should not Lay it on lightlie; breake no limb, and bruise him Three-quarters dead, I care not; he may live Many a faire day after it.
