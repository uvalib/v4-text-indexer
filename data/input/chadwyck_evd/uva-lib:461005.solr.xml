      <field name="fulltext">THE CUP A TRAGEDY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. GALATIANS. Synorix, an ex-Tetrarch. Sinnatus, a Tetrarch. Attendant. Boy. Maid. PhÅbe. Camma, wife of Sinnatus, afterwards Priestess in the Temple of Artemis. ROMANS. Antonius, a Roman General. Publius. Nobleman. Messenger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âDistant View of a City of Galatia. As the curtain rises, Priestesses are heard singing in the Temple. Boy discovered on a pathway among Rocks, picking grapes. A party of Roman Soldiers, guarding a prisoner in chains, come down the pathway and exeunt. Enter Synorix (looking round). Singing ceases. Synorix. Pine, beech and plane, oak, walnut, apricot, Vine, cypress, poplar, myrtle, bowering-in The city where she dwells. She past me here Three years ago when I was flying from My Tetrarchy to Rome. I almost touch'd herâ A maiden slowly moving on to music Among her maidens to this TempleâO Gods! She is my fateâelse wherefore has my fate Brought me again to her own city?âmarried Sinceâmarried Sinnatus, the Tetrarch hereâ But if he be conspirator, Rome will chain, Or slay him. I may trust to gain her then When I shall have my tetrarchy restored By Rome, our mistress, grateful that I show'd her The weakness and the dissonance of our clans, And how to crush them easily. Wretched race! And once I wish'd to scourge them to the bones. But in this narrow breathing-time of life Is vengeance for its own sake worth the while, If once our ends are gain'd? and now this cupâ I never felt such passion for a woman. [Brings out a cup and scroll from under his cloak. What have I written to her? [Reading the scroll. âTo the admired Camma, wife of Sinnatus, the Tetrarch, one who years ago, himself an adorer of our great goddess, Artemis, beheld you afar off worshipping in her Temple, and loved you for it, sends you this cup rescued from the burning of one of her shrines in a city thro' which he past with the Roman army: it is the cup we use in our marriages. Receive it from one who cannot at present write himself other than âA Galatian serving by force in the Roman Legion.â [Turns and looks up to Boy. Boy, dost thou know the house of Sinnatus? Boy. These grapes are for the house of Sinnatusâ Close to the Temple. Synorix. Yonder? Boy. Yes. Synorix (aside). That I With all my range of women should yet shun To meet her face to face at once! My boy, [Boy comes down rocks to him. Take thou this letter and this cup to Camma, The wife of Sinnatus. Boy. Going or gone to-day To hunt with Sinnatus. Synorix. That matters not. Take thou this cup and leave it at her doors. [Gives the cup and scroll to the Boy. Boy. I will, my lord. [Takes his basket of grapes and exit. Enter Antonius. Antonius (meeting the Boy as he goes out). Why, whither runs the boy? Is that the cup you rescued from the fire? Synorix. I send it to the wife of Sinnatus, One half besotted in religious rites. You come here with your soldiers to enforce The long-withholden tribute: you suspect This Sinnatus of playing patriotism, Which in your sense is treason. You have yet No proof against him: now this pious cup Is passport to their house, and open arms To him who gave it; and once there I warrant I worm thro' all their windings. Antonius. If you prosper, Our Senate, wearied of their tetrarchies, Their quarrels with themselves, their spites at Rome, Is like enough to cancel them, and throne One king above them all, who shall be true To the Roman: and from what I heard in Rome, This tributary crown may fall to you. Synorix. The king, the crown! their talk in Rome? is it so? [Antonius nods. WellâI shall serve Galatia taking it, And save her from herself, and be to Rome More faithful than a Roman. [Turns and sees Camma coming. Stand aside, Stand aside; here she comes! [Watching Camma as she enters with her Maid. Camma (to Maid). Where is he, girl? Maid. You know the waterfall That in the summer keeps the mountain side, But after rain o'erleaps a jutting rock And shoots three hundred feet. Camma. The stag is there? Maid. Seen in the thicket at the bottom there But yester-even. Camma. Good then, we will climb The mountain opposite and watch the chase. [They descend the rocks and exeunt. Synorix (watching her). (Aside.) The bust of Juno and the brows and eyes Of Venus; face and form unmatchable! Antonius. Why do you look at her so lingeringly? Synorix. To see if years have changed her. Antonius (sarcastically). Love her, do you? Synorix. I envied Sinnatus when he married her. Antonius. She knows it? Ha! Synorix. Sheâno, nor ev'n my face. Antonius. Nor Sinnatus either? Synorix. No, nor Sinnatus. Antonius. Hot-blooded! I have heard them say in Rome, That your own people cast you from their bounds, For some unprincely violence to a woman, As Rome did Tarquin. Synorix. Well, if this were so, I here return like Tarquinâfor a crown. Antonius. And may be foil'd like Tarquin, if you follow Not the dry light of Rome's straight-going policy, But the fool-fire of love or lust, which well May make you lose yourself, may even drown you In the good regard of Rome. Synorix. Tutâfear me not; I ever had my victories among women. I am most true to Rome. Antonius (aside). I hate the man! What filthy tools our Senate works with! Still I must obey them. (Aloud.) Fare you well. [Going. Synorix. Farewell! Antonius (stopping). A moment! If you track this Sinnatus In any treason, I give you here an order [Produces a paper. To seize upon him. Let me sign it. (Signs it.) There âAntonius leader of the Roman Legion.â [Hands the paper to Synorix. Goes up pathway and exit. Synorix. Woman again!âbut I am wiser now. No rushing on the gameâthe net,âthe net. [Shouts of âSinnatus! Sinnatus!â Then horn. Looking off stage.] He comes, a rough, bluff, simple-looking fellow. If we may judge the kernel by the husk, Not one to keep a woman's fealty when Assailed by Craft and Love. I'll join with him: I may reap something from himâcome upon her Again, perhaps, to-dayâher. Who are with him? I see no face that knows me. Shall I risk it? I am a Roman now, they dare not touch me. I will. Enter Sinnatus, Huntsmen and hounds. Fair Sir, a happy day to you! You reck but little of the Roman here, While you can take your pastime in the woods. Sinnatus. Ay, ay, why not? What would you with me, man? Synorix. I am a life-long lover of the chase, And tho' a stranger fain would be allow'd To join the hunt. Sinnatus. Your name? Synorix. Strato, my name. Sinnatus. No Roman name? Synorix. A Greek, my lord; you know That we Galatians are both Greek and Gaul. [Shouts and horns in the distance. Sinnatus. Hillo, the stag! (To Synorix.) What, you are all unfurnish'd? Give him a bow and arrowsâfollowâfollow. [Exit, followed by Huntsmen. Synorix. Slowly but surelyâtill I see my way. It is the one step in the dark beyond Our expectation, that amazes us. [Distant shouts and horns. Hillo! Hillo! [Exit Synorix. Shouts and horns. Scene II. âA Room in the Tetrarch's House. Frescoed figures on the walls. Evening. Moonlight outside. A couch with cushions on it. A small table with flagon of wine, cups, plate of grapes, etc., also the cup of Scene I. A chair with drapery on it. Camma enters, and opens curtains of window. Camma. No Sinnatus yetâand there the rising moon. [Takes up a cithern and sits on couch. Plays and sings. âMoon on the field and the foam, Moon on the waste and the wold, Moon bring him home, bring him home Safe from the dark and the cold, Home, sweet moon, bring him home, Home with the flock to the foldâ Safe from the wolfââ (Listening.) Is he coming? I thought I heard A footstep. No not yet. They say that Rome Sprang from a wolf. I fear my dear lord mixt With some conspiracy against the wolf. This mountain shepherd never dream'd of Rome. (Sings.) âSafe from the wolf to the foldââ And that great break of precipice that runs Thro' all the wood, where twenty years ago Huntsman, and hound, and deer were all neck-broken! Nay, here he comes. Enter Sinnatus followed by Synorix. Sinnatus (angrily). I tell thee, my good fellow, My arrow struck the stag. Synorix. But was it so? Nay, you were further off: besides the wind Went with my arrow. Sinnatus. I am sure I struck him. Synorix. And I am just as sure, my lord, I struck him. (Aside.) And I may strike your game when you are gone. Camma. Come, come, we will not quarrel about the stag. I have had a weary day in watching you. Yours must have been a wearier. Sit and eat, And take a hunter's vengeance on the meats. Sinnatus. No, noâwe have eatenâwe are heated. Wine! Camma. Who is our guest? Sinnatus. Strato he calls himself. [Camma offers wine to Synorix, while Sinnatus helps himself. Sinnatus. I pledge you, Strato. [Drinks. Synorix. And I you, my lord. [Drinks. Sinnatus (seeing the cup sent to Camma). What's here? Camma. A strange gift sent to me to-day. A sacred cup saved from a blazing shrine Of our great Goddess, in some city where Antonius past. I had believed that Rome Made war upon the peoples not the Gods. Synorix. Most like the city rose against Antonius, Whereon he fired it, and the sacred shrine By chance was burnt along with it. Sinnatus. Had you then No message with the cup? Camma. Why, yes, see here. [Gives him the scroll. Sinnatus (reads). âTo the admired Camma,âbeheld you afar offâ loved youâsends you this cupâthe cup we use in our marriagesâcannot at present write himself other than âA Galatian serving by force in the Roman Legion.â Serving by force! Were there no boughs to hang on, Rivers to drown in? Serve by force? No force Could make me serve by force. Synorix. How then, my lord? The Roman is encampt without your cityâ The force of Rome a thousand-fold our own. Must all Galatia hang or drown herself? And you a Prince and Tetrarch in this provinceâ Sinnatus. Province! Synorix. Well, well, they call it so in Rome. Sinnatus (angrily). Province! Synorix. A noble anger! but Antonius To-morrow will demand your tributeâyou, Can you make war? Have you alliances? Bithynia, Pontus, Paphlagonia? We have had our leagues of old with Eastern kings. There is my handâif such a league there be. What will you do? Sinnatus. Not set myself abroach And run my mind out to a random guest Who join'd me in the hunt. You saw my hounds True to the scent; and we have two-legg'd dogs Among us who can smell a true occasion, And when to bark and how. Synorix. My good Lord Sinnatus, I once was at the hunting of a lion. Roused by the clamour of the chase he woke, Came to the front of the woodâhis monarch mane Bristled about his quick earsâhe stood there Staring upon the hunter. A score of dogs Gnaw'd at his ankles: at the last he felt The trouble of his feet, put forth one paw, Slew four, and knew it not, and so remain'd Staring upon the hunter: and this Rome Will crush you if you wrestle with her; then Save for some slight report in her own Senate Scarce know what she has done. (Aside.) Would I could move him, Provoke him any way! (Aloud.) The Lady Camma, Wise I am sure as she is beautiful, Will close with me that to submit at once Is better than a wholly-hopeless war, Our gallant citizens murder'd all in vain, Son, husband, brother gash'd to death in vain, And the small state more cruelly trampled on Than had she never moved. Camma. Sir, I had once A boy who died a babe; but were he living And grown to man and Sinnatus will'd it, I Would set him in the front rank of the fight With scarce a pang. (Rises.) Sir, if a state submit At once, she may be blotted out at once And swallow'd in the conqueror's chronicle. Whereas in wars of freedom and defence The glory and grief of battle won or lost Solders a race togetherâyeaâtho' they fail, The names of those who fought and fell are like A bank'd-up fire that flashes out again From century to century, and at last May lead them on to victoryâI hope soâ Like phantoms of the Gods. Sinnatus. Well spoken, wife. Synorix (bowing). Madam, so well I yield. Sinnatus. I should not wonder If Synorix, who has dwelt three years in Rome And wrought his worst against his native land, Returns with this Antonius. Synorix. What is Synorix? Sinnatus. Galatian, and not know? This Synorix Was Tetrarch here, and tyrant alsoâdid Dishonour to our wives. Synorix. Perhaps you judge him With feeble charity: being as you tell me Tetrarch, there might be willing wives enough To feel dishonour, honour. Camma. Do not say so. I know of no such wives in all Galatia. There may be courtesans for aught I know Whose life is one dishonour. Enter Attendant. Attendant (aside). My lord, the men! Sinnatus (aside). Our anti-Roman faction? Attendant (aside). Ay, my lord. Synorix (overhearing). (Aside.) I have enoughâtheir anti-Roman faction. Sinnatus (aloud). Some friends of mine would speak with me without. You, Strato, make good cheer till I return. [Exit. Synorix. I have much to say, no time to say it in. First, lady, know myself am that Galatian Who sent the cup. Camma. I thank you from my heart. Synorix. Then that I serve with Rome to serve Galatia. That is my secret: keep it, or you sell me To torment and to death. [Coming closer. For your ear onlyâ I love youâfor your love to the great Goddess. The Romans sent me here a spy upon you, To draw you and your husband to your doom. I'd sooner die than do it. [Takes out paper given him by Antonius. This paper sign'd Antoniusâwill you take it, read it? there! Camma. (Reads.) âYou are to seize on Sinnatus,âifââ Synorix. (Snatches paper.) No more. What follows is for no wife's eyes. O Camma, Rome has a glimpse of this conspiracy; Rome never yet hath spar'd conspirator. Horrible! flaying, scourging, crucifyingâ Camma. I am tender enough. Why do you practise on me? Synorix. Why should I practise on you? How you wrong me! I am sure of being every way malign'd. And if you should betray me to your husbandâ Camma. Will you betray him by this order? Synorix. See, I tear it all to pieces, never dream'd Of acting on it. [Tears the paper. Camma. I owe you thanks for ever. Synorix. Hath Sinnatus never told you of this plot? Camma. What plot? Synorix. A child's sand-castle on the beach For the next waveâall seen,âall calculated, All known by Rome. No chance for Sinnatus. Camma. Why said you not as much to my brave Sinnatus? Synorix. Braveâayâtoo brave, too over-confident, Too like to ruin himself, and you, and me! Who else, with this black thunderbolt of Rome Above him, would have chased the stag to-day In the full face of all the Roman camp? A miracle that they let him home again, Not caught, maim'd, blinded him. [Camma shudders. (Aside.)I have made her tremble. (Aloud.) I know they mean to torture him to death. I dare not tell him how I came to know it; I durst not trust him withâmy serving Rome To serve Galatia: you heard him on the letter. Not say as much? I all but said as much. I am sure I told him that his plot was folly. I say it to youâyou are wiserâRome knows all, But you know not the savagery of Rome. Camma. Oâhave you power with Rome? use it for him! Synorix. Alas! I have no such power with Rome. All that Lies with Antonius. [As if struck by a sudden thought. Comes over to her. He will pass to-morrow In the gray dawn before the Temple doors. You have beauty,âO great beauty,âand Antonius, So gracious toward women, never yet Flung back a woman's prayer. Plead to him, I am sure you will prevail. Camma. StillâI should tell My husband. Synorix. Will he let you plead for him To a Roman? Camma. I fear not. Synorix. Then do not tell him. Or tell him, if you will, when you return, When you have charm'd our general into mercy, And all is safe again. O dearest lady, [Murmurs of âSynorix! Synorix!â heard outside. Think,âtorture,âdeath,âand come. Camma. I will, I will. And I will not betray you. Synorix (aside). (As Sinnatus enters.) Stand apart. Enter Sinnatus and Attendant. Sinnatus. Thou art that Synorix! One whom thou hast wrong'd Without there, knew thee with Antonius. They howl for thee, to rend thee head from limb. Synorix. I am much malign'd. I thought to serve Galatia. Sinnatus. Serve thyself first, villain! They shall not harm My guest within my house. There! (points to door) there! this door Opens upon the forest! Out, begone! Henceforth I am thy mortal enemy. Synorix. However I thank thee (draws his sword); thou hast saved my life. [Exit. Sinnatus. (To Attendant.) Return and tell them Synorix is not here. [Exit Attendant. What did that villain Synorix say to you? Camma. Is heâthatâSynorix? Sinnatus. Wherefore should you doubt it? One of the men there knew him. Camma. Only one, And he perhaps mistaken in the face. Sinnatus. Come, come, could he deny it? What did he say? Camma. What should he say? Sinnatus. What should he say, my wife! He should say this, that being Tetrarch once His own true people cast him from their doors Like a base coin. Camma. Not kindly to them? Sinnatus. Kindly? O the most kindly Prince in all the world! Would clap his honest citizens on the back, Bandy their own rude jests with them, be curious About the welfare of their babes, their wives, O ayâtheir wivesâtheir wives. What should he say? He should say nothing to my wife if I Were by to throttle him! He steep'd himself In all the lust of Rome. How should you guess What manner of beast it is? Camma. Yet he seem'd kindly, And said he loathed the cruelties that Rome Wrought on her vassals. Sinnatus. Did he, honest man? Camma. And you, that seldom brook the stranger here, Have let him hunt the stag with you to-day. Sinnatus. I warrant you now, he said he struck the stag. Camma. Why no, he never touch'd upon the stag. Sinnatus. Why so I said, my arrow. Well, to sleep. [Goes to close door. Camma. Nay, close not yet the door upon a night That looks half day. Sinnatus. True; and my friends may spy him And slay him as he runs. Camma. He is gone already. Oh look,âyon grove upon the mountain,âwhite In the sweet moon as with a lovelier snow! But what a blotch of blackness underneath! Sinnatus, you rememberâyea, you must, That there three years agoâthe vast vine-bowers Ran to the summit of the trees, and dropt Their streamers earthward, which a breeze of May Took ever and anon, and open'd out The purple zone of hill and heaven; there You told your love; and like the swaying vinesâ Yea,âwith our eyes,âour hearts, our prophet hopes Let in the happy distance, and that all But cloudless heaven which we have found together In our three married years! You kiss'd me there For the first time. Sinnatus, kiss me now. Sinnatus. First kiss. (Kisses her.) There then. You talk almost as if it Might be the last. Camma. Will you not eat a little? Sinnatus. No, no, we found a goat-herd's hut and shared His fruits and milk. Liar! You will believe Now that he never struck the stagâa brave one Which you shall see to-morrow. Camma. I rise to-morrow In the gray dawn, and take this holy cup To lodge it in the shrine of Artemis. Sinnatus. Good! Camma. If I be not back in half an hour, Come after me. Sinnatus. What! is there danger? Camma. Nay, None that I know: 'tis but a step from here To the Temple. Sinnatus. All my brain is full of sleep. Wake me before you go, I'll after youâ After me now! [Closes door and exit. Camma (drawing curtains). Your shadow. Synorixâ His face was not malignant, and he said That men malign'd him. Shall I go? Shall I go? Death, tortureâ âHe never yet flung back a woman's prayerââ I go, but I will have my dagger with me. [Exit. Scene III. âSame as Scene I. Dawn. Music and Singing in the Temple. Enter Synorix watchfully, after him Publius and Soldiers. Synorix. Publius! Publius. Here! Synorix. Do you remember what I told you? Publius. When you cry âRome, Rome,â to seize On whomsoever may be talking with you, Or man, or woman, as traitors unto Rome. Synorix. Right. Back again. How many of you are there? Publius. Some half a score. [Exeunt Soldiers and Publius Synorix. I have my guard about me. I need not fear the crowd that hunted me Across the woods, last night. I hardly gain'd The camp at midnight. Will she come to me Now that she knows me Synorix? Not if Sinnatus Has told her all the truth about me. Well, I cannot help the mould that I was cast in. I fling all that upon my fate, my star. I know that I am genial, I would be Happy, and make all others happy so They did not thwart me. Nay, she will not come. Yet if she be a true and loving wife She may, perchance, to save this husband. Ay! See, see, my white bird stepping toward the snare. Why now I count it all but miracle, That this brave heart of mine should shake me so, As helplessly as some unbearded boy's When first he meets his maiden in a bower. Enter Camma (with cup). Synorix. The lark first takes the sunlight on his wing, But you, twin sister of the morning star, Forelead the sun. Camma. Where is Antonius? Synorix. Not here as yet. You are too early for him. [She crosses towards Temple. Synorix. Nay, whither go you now? Camma. To lodge this cup Within the holy shrine of Artemis, And so return. Synorix. To find Antonius here. [She goes into the Temple, he looks after her. The loveliest life that ever drew the light From heaven to brood upon her, and enrich Earth with her shadow! I trust she will return. These Romans dare not violate the Temple. No, I must lure my game into the camp. A woman I could live and die for. What! Die for a woman, what new faith is this? I am not mad, not sick, not old enough To doat on one alone. Yes, mad for her, Camma the stately, Camma the great-hearted, So mad, I fear some strange and evil chance Coming upon me, for by the Gods I seem Strange to myself. Re-enter Camma. Camma. Where is Antonius? Synorix. Where? As I said before, you are still too early. Camma. Too early to be here alone with thee; For whether men malign thy name, or no, It bears an evil savour among women. Where is Antonius? (Loud.) Synorix. Madam, as you know The camp is half a league without the city; If you will walk with me we needs must meet Antonius coming, or at least shall find him There in the camp. Camma. No, not one step with thee. Where is Antonius? (Louder.) Synorix (advancing towards her). Then for your own sake, Lady, I say it with all gentleness, And for the sake of Sinnatus your husband, I must compel you. Camma (drawing her dagger). Stay!âtoo near is death. Synorix (disarming her). Is it not easy to disarm a woman? Enter Sinnatus (seizes him from behind by the throat). Synorix (throttled and scarce audible). Rome! Rome! Sinnatus. Adulterous dog! Synorix (stabbing him with Camma's dagger). What! will you have it? [Camma utters a cry and runs to Sinnatus. Sinnatus (falls backward). I have it in my heartâto the Templeâflyâ For my sakeâor they seize on thee. Remember! Awayâfarewell! [Dies. Camma (runs up the steps into the Temple, looking back). Farewell! Synorix (seeing her escape). The women of the Temple drag her in. Publius! Publius! No, Antonius would not suffer me to break Into the sanctuary. She hath escaped. [Looking down at Sinnatus. âAdulterous dog!â that red-faced rage at me! Then with one quick short stabâeternal peace. So end all passions. Then what use in passions? To warm the cold bounds of our dying life And, lest we freeze in mortal apathy, Employ us, heat us, quicken us, help us, keep us From seeing all too near that urn, those ashes Which all must be. Well used, they serve us well. I heard a saying in Egypt, that ambition Is like the sea wave, which the more you drink, The more you thirstâyeaâdrink too much, as men Have done on rafts of wreckâit drives you mad. I will be no such wreck, am no such gamester As, having won the stake, would dare the chance Of double, or losing all. The Roman Senate, For I have always play'd into their hands, Means me the crown. And Camma for my brideâ The people love herâif I win her love, They too will cleave to me, as one with her. There then I rest, Rome's tributary king. [Looking down on Sinnatus. Why did I strike him?âhaving proof enough Against the man, I surely should have left That stroke to Rome. He saved my life too. Did he? It seem'd so. I have play'd the sudden fool. And that sets her against meâfor the moment. Cammaâwell, well, I never found the woman I could not force or wheedle to my will. She will be glad at last to wear my crown. And I will make Galatia prosperous too, And we will chirp among our vines, and smile At bygone things till that (pointing to Sinnatus) eternal peace. Rome! Rome! Enter Publius and Soldiers. Twice I cried Rome. Why came ye not before? Publius. Why come we now? Whom shall we seize upon? Synorix (pointing to the body of Sinnatus). The body of that dead traitor Sinnatus. Bear him away. Music and Singing in Temple.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene.âInterior of the Temple of Artemis. Small gold gates on platform in front of the veil before the colossal statue of the Goddess, and in the centre of the Temple a tripod altar, on which is a lighted lamp. Lamps (lighted) suspended between each pillar. Tripods, vases, garlands of flowers, etc., about stage. Altar at back close to Goddess, with two cups. Solemn music. Priestesses decorating the Temple. (The Chorus of Priestesses sing as they enter.) Artemis, Artemis, hear us, O Mother, hear us, and bless us! Artemis, thou that art life to the wind, to the wave, to the glebe, to the fire! Hear thy people who praise thee! O help us from all that oppress us! Hear thy priestesses hymn thy glory! O yield them all their desire! Priestess. PhÅbe, that man from Synorix, who has been So oft to see the Priestess, waits once more Before the Temple. PhÅbe. We will let her know. [Signs to one of the Priestesses, who goes out. Since Camma fled from Synorix to our Temple, And for her beauty, stateliness, and power, Was chosen Priestess here, have you not mark'd Her eyes were ever on the marble floor? To-day they are fixt and brightâthey look straight out. Hath she made up her mind to marry him? Priestess. To marry him who stabb'd her Sinnatus. You will not easily make me credit that. PhÅbe. Ask her. Enter Camma as Priestess (in front of the curtains). Priestess. You will not marry Synorix? Camma. My girl, I am the bride of Death, and only Marry the dead. Priestess. Not Synorix then? Camma. My girl, At times this oracle of great Artemis Has no more power than other oracles To speak directly. PhÅbe. Will you speak to him, The messenger from Synorix who waits Before the Temple? Camma. Why not? Let him enter. [Comes forward on to step by tripod. Enter a Messenger. Messenger (kneels). Greeting and health from Synorix! More than once You have refused his hand. When last I saw you, You all but yielded. He entreats you now For your last answer. When he struck at Sinnatusâ As I have many a time declared to youâ He knew not at the moment who had fasten'd About his throatâhe begs you to forget it. As scarce his act:âa random stroke: all else Was love for you: he prays you to believe him. Camma. I pray him to believeâthat I believe him. Messenger. Why that is well. You mean to marry him? Camma. I mean to marry himâif that be well. Messenger. This very day the Romans crown him king For all his faithful services to Rome. He wills you then this day to marry him, And so be throned together in the sight Of all the people, that the world may know You twain are reconciled, and no more feuds Disturb our peaceful vassalage to Rome. Camma. To-day? Too sudden. I will brood upon it. When do they crown him? Messenger. Even now. Camma. And where? Messenger. Here by your temple. Camma. Come once more to me Before the crowning,âI will answer you. [Exit Messenger. PhÅbe. Great Artemis! O Camma, can it be well, Or good, or wise, that you should clasp a hand Red with the sacred blood of Sinnatus? Camma. Good! mine own dagger driven by Synorix found All good in the true heart of Sinnatus, And quench'd it there for ever. Wise! Life yields to death and wisdom bows to Fate, Is wisest, doing so. Did not this man Speak well? We cannot fight imperial Rome, But he and I are both Galatian-born, And tributary sovereigns, he and I Might teach this Romeâfrom knowledge of our peopleâ Where to lay on her tributeâheavily here And lightly there. Might I not live for that, And drown all poor self-passion in the sense Of public good? PhÅbe. I am sure you will not marry him. Camma. Are you so sure? I pray you wait and see. [Shouts (from the distance), âSynorix! Synorix!â Camma. Synorix, Synorix! So they cried Sinnatus Not so long sinceâthey sicken me. The One Who shifts his policy suffers something, must Accuse himself, excuse himself; the Many Will feel no shame to give themselves the lie. PhÅbe. Most like it was the Roman soldier shouted. Camma. Their shield-borne patriot of the morning star Hang'd at mid-day, their traitor of the dawn The clamour'd darling of their afternoon! And that same head they would have play'd at ball with And kick'd it featurelessâthey now would crown. [Flourish of trumpets. Enter a Galatian Nobleman with crown on a cushion. Noble (kneels). Greeting and health from Synorix. He sends you This diadem of the first Galatian Queen, That you may feed your fancy on the glory of it, And join your life this day with his, and wear it Beside him on his throne. He waits your answer. Camma. Tell him there is one shadow among the shadows, One ghost of all the ghostsâas yet so new, So strange among themâsuch an alien there, So much of husband in it stillâthat if The shout of Synorix and Camma sitting Upon one throne, should reach it, it would rise He! . . . He, with that red star between the ribs, And my knife thereâand blast the king and me, And blanch the crowd with horror. I dare not, sir! Throne himâand then the marriageâay and tell him That I accept the diadem of Galatiaâ [All are amazed. Yea, that ye saw me crown myself withal. [Puts on the crown. I wait him his crown'd queen. Noble. So will I tell him. [Exit. Music. Two Priestesses go up the steps before the shrine, draw the curtains on either side (discovering the Goddess), then open the gates and remain on steps, one on either side, and kneel. A priestess goes off and returns with a veil of marriage, then assists PhÅbe to veil Camma. At the same time Priestesses enter and stand on either side of the Temple. Camma and all the Priestesses kneel, raise their hands to the Goddess, and bow down. [Shouts, âSynorix! Synorix!â All rise. Camma. Fling wide the doors, and let the new-made children Of our imperial mother see the show. [Sunlight pours through the doors. I have no heart to do it. (To PhÅbe). Look for me! [Crouches. PhÅbe looks out. [Shouts, âSynorix! Synorix!â PhÅbe. He climbs the throne. Hot blood, ambition, pride So bloat and redden his faceâO would it were His third last apoplexy! O bestial! O how unlike our goodly Sinnatus. Camma (on the ground). You wrong him surely; far as the face goes A goodlier-looking man than Sinnatus. PhÅbe (aside). How dare she say it? I could hate her for it But that she is distracted. [A flourish of trumpets. Camma. Is he crown'd? PhÅbe. Ay, there they crown him. [Crowd without shout, âSynorix! Synorix!â Camma. [A Priestess brings a box of spices to Camma, who throws them on the altar-flame. Rouse the dead altar-flame, fling in the spices, Nard, Cinnamon, amomum, benzoin. Let all the air reel into a mist of odour, As in the midmost heart of Paradise. Lay down the Lydian carpets for the king. The king should pace on purple to his bride, And music there to greet my lord the king. [Music. (To PhÅbe). Dost thou remember when I wedded Sinnatus? Ay, thou wast thereâwhether from maiden fears Or reverential love for him I loved, Or some strange second-sight, the marriage cup Wherefrom we make libation to the Goddess So shook within my hand, that the red wine Ran down the marble and lookt like blood, like blood. PhÅbe. I do remember your first-marriage fears. Camma. I have no fears at this my second marriage. See hereâI stretch my hand outâhold it there. How steady it is! PhÅbe. Steady enough to stab him! Camma. O hush! O peace! This violence ill becomes The silence of our Temple. Gentleness, Low words best chime with this solemnity. Enter a procession of Priestesses and Children bearing garlands and golden goblets, and strewing flowers. Enter Synorix (as King, with gold laurel-wreath crown and purple robes), followed by Antonius, Publius, Noblemen, Guards, and the Populace. Camma. Hail, King! Synorix. Hail, Queen! The wheel of Fate has roll'd me to the top. I would that happiness were gold, that I Might cast my largess of it to the crowd! I would that every man made feast to-day Beneath the shadow of our pines and planes! For all my truer life begins to-day. The past is like a travell'd land now sunk Below the horizonâlike a barren shore That grew salt weeds, but now all drown'd in love And glittering at full tideâthe bounteous bays And havens filling with a blissful sea. Nor speak I now too mightily, being King And happy! happiest, Lady, in my power To make you happy. Camma. Yes, sir. Synorix. Our Antonius, Our faithful friend of Rome, tho' Rome may set A free foot where she will, yet of his courtesy Entreats he may be present at our marriage. Camma. Let him comeâa legion with him, if he will. (To Antonius.) Welcome, my lord Antonius, to our Temple. (To Synorix.) You on this side the altar. (To Antonius.) You on that. Call first upon the Goddess, Synorix. [All face the Goddess. Priestesses, Children, Populace, and Guards kneelâthe others remain standing. Synorix. O Thou, that dost inspire the germ with life, The child, a thread within the house of birth, And give him limbs, then air, and send him forth The glory of his fatherâThou whose breath Is balmy wind to robe our hills with grass, And kindle all our vales with myrtle-blossom, And roll the golden oceans of our grain, And sway the long grape-bunches of our vines, And fill all hearts with fatness and the lust Of plentyâmake me happy in my marriage! Chorus (chanting). Artemis, Artemis, hear him, Ionian Artemis! Camma. O Thou that slayest the babe within the womb Or in the being born, or after slayest him As boy or man, great Goddess, whose storm-voice Unsockets the strong oak, and rears his root Beyond his head, and strows our fruits, and lays Our golden grain, and runs to sea and makes it Foam over all the fleeted wealth of kings And peoples, hear. Whose arrow is the plagueâwhose quick flash splits The mid-sea mast, and rifts the tower to the rock, And hurls the victor's column down with him That crowns it, hear. Who causest the safe earth to shudder and gape, And gulf and flatten in her closing chasm Domed cities, hear. Whose lava-torrents blast and blacken a province To a cinder, hear. Whose winter-cataracts find a realm and leave it A waste of rock and ruin, hear. I call thee To make my marriage prosper to my wish! Chorus. Artemis, Artemis, hear her, Ephesian Artemis! Camma. Artemis, Artemis, hear me, Galatian Artemis! I call on our own Goddess in our own Temple. Chorus. Artemis, Artemis, hear her, Galatian Artemis! [Thunder. All rise. Synorix (aside). Thunder! Ay, ay, the storm was drawing hither Across the hills when I was being crown'd. I wonder if I look as pale as she? Camma. Art thouâstill bentâon marrying? Synorix. Surelyâyet These are strange words to speak to Artemis. Camma. Words are not always what they seem, my King. I will be faithful to thee till thou die. Synorix. I thank thee, Camma,âI thank thee. Camma (turning to Antonius). Antonius, Much graced are we that our Queen Rome in you Deigns to look in upon our barbarisms. [Turns, goes up steps to altar before the Goddess. Takes a cup from off the altar. Holds it towards Antonius. Antonius goes up to the foot of the steps, opposite to Synorix. You see this cup, my lord. [Gives it to him. Antonius. Most curious! The many-breasted mother Artemis Emboss'd upon it. Camma. It is old, I know not How many hundred years. Give it me again. It is the cup belonging our own Temple. [Puts it back on altar, and takes up the cup of Act I. Showing it to Antonius. Here is another sacred to the Goddess, The gift of Synorix; and the Goddess, being For this most grateful, wills, thro' me her Priestess, In honour of his gift and of our marriage, That Synorix should drink from his own cup. Synorix. I thank thee, Camma,âI thank thee. Camma. Forâmy lordâ It is our ancient custom in Galatia That ere two souls be knit for life and death, They two should drink together from one cup, In symbol of their married unity, Making libation to the Goddess. Bring me The costly wines we use in marriages. [They bring in a large jar of wine. Camma pours wine into cup. (To Synorix.) See here, I fill it. (To Antonius.) Will you drink, my lord? Antonius. I? Why should I? I am not to be married. Camma. But that might bring a Roman blessing on us. Antonius (refusing cup). Thy pardon, Priestess! Camma. Thou art in the right. This blessing is for Synorix and for me. See first I make libation to the Goddess, [Makes libation. And now I drink. [Drinks and fills the cup again. Thy turn, Galatian King. Drink and drink deepâour marriage will be fruitful. Drink and drink deep, and thou wilt make me happy. [Synorix goes up to her. She hands him the cup. He drinks. Synorix. There, Camma! I have almost drain'd the cupâ A few drops left. Camma. Libation to the Goddess. [He throws the remaining drops on the altar and gives Camma the cup. Camma (placing the cup on the altar). Why then the Goddess hears. [Comes down and forward to tripod. Antonius follows. Antonius, Where wast thou on that morning when I came To plead to thee for Sinnatus's life, Beside this temple half a year ago? Antonius. I never heard of this request of thine. Synorix (coming forward hastily to foot of tripod steps). I sought him and I could not find him. Pray you, Go on with the marriage rites. Camma. Antoniusâ âCamma!â who spake? Antonius. Not I. PhÅbe. Nor any here. Camma. I am all but sure that some one spake. Antonius, If you had found him plotting against Rome, Would you have tortured Sinnatus to death? Antonius. No thought was mine of torture or of death, But had I found him plotting, I had counsell'd him To rest from vain resistance. Rome is fated To rule the world. Then, if he had not listen'd, I might have sent him prisoner to Rome. Synorix. Why do you palter with the ceremony? Go on with the marriage rites. Camma. They are finish'd. Synorix. How! Camma. Thou hast drunk deep enough to make me happy. Dost thou not feel the love I bear to thee Glow thro' thy veins? Synorix. The love I bear to thee Glows thro' my veins since first I look'd on thee. But wherefore slur the perfect ceremony? The sovereign of Galatia weds his Queen. Let all be done to the fullest in the sight Of all the Gods. Nay, rather than so clip The flowery robe of Hymen, we would add Some golden fringe of gorgeousness beyond Old use, to make the day memorial, when Synorix, first King, Camma, first Queen o' the Realm, Drew here the richest lot from Fate, to live And die together. This painâwhat is it?âagain? I had a touch of this last yearâinâRome. Yes, yes. (To Antonius.) Your armâa momentâIt will pass. I reel beneath the weight of utter joyâ This all too happy day, crownâqueen at once. [Staggers. O all ye GodsâJupiter!âJupiter! [Falls backward. Camma. Dost thou cry out upon the Gods of Rome? Thou art Galatian-born. Our Artemis Has vanquish'd their Diana. Synorix (on the ground). I am poison'd. Sheâclose the Temple door. Let her not fly. Camma (leaning on tripod). Have I not drunk of the same cup with thee? Synorix. Ay, by the Gods of Rome and all the world, She tooâshe tooâthe bride! the Queen! and Iâ Monstrous! I that loved her. Camma. I loved him. Synorix. O murderous mad-woman! I pray you lift me And make me walk awhile. I have heard these poisons May be walk'd down. [Antonius and Publius raise him up. My feet are tons of lead, They will break in the earthâI am sinkingâhold meâ Let me alone. [They leave him; he sinks down on ground. Too lateâthought myself wiseâ A woman's dupe. Antonius, tell the Senate I have been most true to Romeâwould have been true To herâifâifâ [Falls as if dead. Camma (coming and leaning over him). So falls the throne of an hour. Synorix (half rising). Throne? is it thou? the Fates are throned, not weâ Not guilty of ourselvesâthy doom and mineâ Thouâcoming my way tooâCammaâgood-night. [Dies. Camma (upheld by weeping Priestesses). Thy way? poor worm, crawl down thine own black hole To the lowest Hell. Antonius, is he there? I meant thee to have follow'dâbetter thus. Nay, if my people must be thralls of Rome, He is gentle, tho' a Roman. [Sinks back into the arms of the Priestesses. Antonius. Thou art one With thine own people, and tho' a Roman I Forgive thee, Camma. Camma (raising herself). âCamma!ââwhy there again I am most sure that some one call'd. O women, Ye will have Roman masters. I am glad I shall not see it. Did not some old Greek Say death was the chief good? He had my fate for it, Poison'd. (Sinks back again.) Have I the crown on? I will go To meet him, crown'd! crown'd victor of my willâ On my last voyageâbut the wind has fail'dâ Growing dark tooâbut light enough to row. Row to the blessed Isles! the blessed Isles!â Sinnatus! Why comes he not to meet me? It is the crown Offends himâand my hands are too sleepy To lift it off. [PhÅbe takes the crown off. Who touch'd me then? I thank you. [Rises, with outspread arms. Thereâleague on league of ever-shining shore Beneath an ever-rising sunâI see himâ âCamma, Camma!â Sinnatus, Sinnatus!
