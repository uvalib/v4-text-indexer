      <field name="fulltext">TERAMINTA. AN OPERA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable RICHARD Earl of BURLINGTON. O BURLINGTON! to ev'ry Muse endear'd, Behold the Bard by thy bright Influence chear'd; Easy his Life, and unconstrain'd his Lays. While his warm Heart glows grateful to thy Praise, He finds his Genius with his Fortunes mend, And knows the Cause, for Burlington's his Friend. Your Lordship's ever obliged, and devoted humble Servant, H. CAREY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGUMENT. Xarino Prince of Cuba quits his Father's Court, for the Love of Teraminta a Beautiful Shepherdess, taking with him his Intimate Friend Cratander, who secretly becomes his Rival and creates such Misunderstanding between the Prince and Teraminta as occasions great Distress; but the Appearance of Ardelia whom Cratander had ungenerously forsaken after the most solemn Protestations of Constancy, so confounds and convicts him, that he sincerely repents, with a Promise never to desist till he has reconciled the Prince and Teraminta, which at last is happily effected. Xarino having sav'd the Life and Empire of King Gozanes his Father, is requested to demand the utmost of his Wishes; he only asks Teraminta, which at first is denied him, but afterwards granted by means of a happy Incident, which extorts a surprising Confession from Gozanes, gives Teraminta to the Prince Ardelia to Cratander, and concludes the Opera.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE, A pleasant Grove, Xarino, Cratander. Xarino. Cratander, this divine and sweet Retirement Makes me abhor the Glories of a Court; These Groves are render'd far more pompous, By charming Teraminta's Presence, Than all my Father's Palaces. Cra. 'Tis wondrous strange, A Prince of such high Birth Shou'd so demean himself, To quit his Father's Court, And live in such Obscurity For a poor Shepherdess. Xar. Forbear, my Friend! can Courts, or Pomp, or Titles, Give me that Joy I find in Teraminta? AIR. In a Plain with the Nymph I adore, 'Tis sweeter, much sweeter to be, Than to reign, with Dominion and Pow'r, A Monarch o'er Land, and o'er Sea. No Throne can my Passion remove, Or tempt me to change my Condition; Her Heart is the Empire of Love, Her Favour my only Ambition. SCENE II. Cratander solus. Cra. Her Soul is soft, And cannot bear his Sighs; While mine are heard unpity'd. Why is Xarino thus preferr'd to me? He is my Prince, 'tis true, But mighty Love disdains Subordination. He is my Rival; In that hated Name, My greatest Enemy. Why did he trust me with this fatal Secret, And tempt my Eyes to teach my Heart Defection? AIR. Loyalty, Friendship, and Duty, All must submit to bright Beauty; No Power can Love's Passion controul. Talk not to Lovers of Reason; Pallas comes quite out of season, When Cupid engrosses the Soul. [Exit. SCENE III. A rural Prospect. Teraminta sola. Ter. How Tasteless are the Beauties of the Spring, Now my Xarino is not here? This Place is robb'd of all That made it once delightful. But see! the Shades Which languish'd in his Absence, Revive now he appears; For lo! he comes, The Face of Nature smiles, And my fond Heart thrills quick to bid him welcome. SCENE IV. Xarino, Teraminta. Xar. If to these humble Plains, ye Gods! You give such Excellence, Here let me dwell for ever, For ever gazing Upon an Object so adorable. Ter. Xarino, well I know, You Shepherds make a Trade of Flattery. The Court has spread its Influence o'er the Plains, And Cottagers have learnt to break their Vows. AIR. Xar. Why does my Charmer treat me so, What Falshood did I ever show? Tho' all Mankind beside shou'd range, I love so true, I cannot change. But, 'tis the Pleasure of your Sex, When most we love, you most perplex. Ter. It is not that I know you false, Xarino, But feare you shou'd be so. Danger is Caution's Sanction; Can then a Virgin be too cautious? But, 'tis unsafe to parley with Temptation, When Flight's the best Security. AIR. When Lovers for Favours petition, Oh! then they approach with Respect; But, when in our Hearts they've Admission, They treat us with Scorn and Neglect. 'Tis dangerous ever to try 'em, So artful are Men to deceive; 'Tis safer, much safer to fly 'em, So easy are Maids to believe. [Exit Teraminta. SCENE V. Xarino solus. Xar. She flies, but such a Cause assigns, As makes that Absence pleasing, Which otherwise wou'd kill me. Auspicious Flight! Sweet, tacit Oracle of my Felicity! AIR. I follow to gain, I fly to obtain This Angel, this Charmer divine! Nor will I depart 'Till I've conquer'd the Heart, Of the Fair who already has mine. [Exit. SCENE VI. A Grove. Ardelia disguis'd. Ard. O fatal Fondness! Whither wilt thou lead me? Must I seek all the Corners of the Earth, To follow one that flies me? Hither I've trac'd my false One, And, in this Disguise, Hope unobserv'd to pass. But see! he comes; With him the fatal Fair, That robs me of his Heart: This friendly Shade, May screen me from their Sight, And give me, but I fear, A Proof too strong Of all his Falshood. [Retires. SCENE VII. Teraminta follow'd by Cratander, Ardelia overhearing. Cra. Cruel Teraminta! Why fly you thus from your Adorer? If my Pursuit's distasteful, You need but turn, and kill me with a Frown. Ter. Oh that I were a Basilisk, To look thee dead, Thou should'st not long pursue me. Ard. What do I hear? She loves him not. Happy Ardelia! Ter. Why dost thou prosecute me thus? Detested Wretch! Must I be ever tortur'd With thy intolerable Passion? Cra. But were Xarino here, Wou'd Teraminta fly? Wou'd she look on him with those Eyes of Scorn, And frown him into Madness? Ter. No, were he here, He wou'd revenge this Insolence. He little thinks his Bosom-Friend, Most treacherously, attempts To be his Rival: But I'll display your Falshood, And he shall punish it. [Exit Ard. Charming Maid! Heav'n keep thee ever in this Mind. [Exit Teraminta. SCENE VIII. Cratander solus. Cra. Punish! by Heav'n he dares not; Those Eyes have forc'd me to forget my Friendship, And any Chain is easy now to break; All but my Love, and that repuls'd with Scorn Revenge shall follow, led by Desperation. AIR. No longer I'll bear In the Heart of the Fair, A Rival thus happy to reign; While I in Despair, Tormented with Care, For ever must sigh and complain. Assist me, Lachesis! Assist me, Nemesis! Ye Furies! ye Destinies aid! Their Union divide, And vanquish the Pride, Of this charming, this obstinate Maid. [Exit. SCENE IX. Ardelia sola. Ard. What Scenes of Mischief agitate his Mind? Heav'n surely sent me here To shield this lovely Maid, and her Belov'd, From all his black Attempts. How odious must these Actions render him, To any Eye but mine; And yet, base as he is, I still must love him. AIR. To love and not belov'd again, Is sure a Grief, all Griefs by far exceeding; What Torments must that Heart sustain, Which burns for those that are for others bleeding? Yet such is my inevitable Woe, I love my Ruin, tho' I know 'tis so. [Exit. SCENE X. A Rural Prospect. Xarino, Cratander. Cra. These Eyes are Witness of her Falshood Xar. It is impossible. Cra. If I'm not believ'd, I've liv'd too long. Xar. It is not that I don't believe, But that I wou'd not. Cra. My Truth in Question! Wou'd I had been dumb! Xar. O my Cratander! pity and excuse me. Cra. Believe it not, my Prince, Believe me false; Think it was all a Vision, Since you'd have it so. The Traitor leaves you, Never more to trouble you With such unwelcome Truths. Xar. Stay, stay, my Friend, 'Tis most Apparent; Foolish Xarino! To think a Woman cou'd be faithful, To think their boasted Virtue Ought but Fiction. Was it for this I left my Father's Court, Rejected proffer'd Crowns, And Royal Beauties, To waste ingloriously my Moments here? I blush at the remembrance. Cra. Now you're a Prince indeed; But yet I fear.â Xar. What fears my Friend? Cra. There's such persuasive Magick in her Eyes, One Negative, one Smile, Will all undo. Xar. To avoid that Danger, I'll instant quit this place, And in my Father's Court, Like what I am, appear. Cra. But sure you'll see her first, To let her know the Cause of your Departure. Xar. O! name her not, She's Poison to my Ears, And for her sake I hate the Sex. AIR. False and Ungrateful faithless Fair! Oh why did I believe In one who only slights my Care, And triumphs to deceive? Yet still I adore her, still languish and die, Sure never was Mortal so wretched as I! [Exit. SCENE XI. Cratander solus. Cra. This is good beginning. 'Tis now my turn to triumph; And cruel Teraminta Shall pay full dear for her Disdain. Assist my Vengeance, dear Deceit! And make the Mischief more compleat. [Exit SCENE XII. Teraminta sola. AIR. Ter. Sing on, sweet Warbler of the Grove! In Strains like these, My Soul appease, And chide my Swain's Delay. Around the fragrant Myrtles rove, Alarm his Ear, Say I am here, And bid him haste away. Enter Messenger with Letter. What means this Letter? Xarino was not us'd To speak by Messengers. He sees I love, and now begins to slight me. Reads. âFair Nymph, your faithless Swain âIs gone to wed another, whose Possessions âAre greater far than yours. âAs for the lost Cratander; âEre this salutes your Eyes, âConclude him now no more; âAnd let his Suff'rings meet that Pity dead, âWhich you deny'd him living. Ter. Lost Teraminta. AIR. Ye Nymphs! for my sake ne'er believe In Man created to deceive, Lest you're like me undone. Wou'd you remain secure and free, And not Repentance taste like me, Their Sex for ever shun. The End of the First ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. SCENE A Plain: Tents, &amp;c. Gozanes following some runaway Troops. Gozanes. O cowards! Dastards, to forsake your King, And give your Country upâfor Shame for Shame! Sure as you fly you lose your Liberties, If not your Livesâbut if once more yon sally, The Fate of War may change, and we succeed. I'll foremost stand upon the brink of Danger; Have I a Friend among you? let him follow, If not, I'll singly purchase Death with Glory. AIR. Death or Conquest I'll obtain, Robb'd of Freedom, Life is vain. Fear! I scorn thee, if I die, Dearly they my Life shall buy. [Exit. SCENE II. An Hermitage. Cratander solus. Cra. Xarino warm'd with Jealousy, Has left me at full Freedom, To try my Fate with Teraminta: Her Heart may change; I've surely now more Hopes than ever; My Rival is away, The Fair incens'd beyond Expression, Nay more, inclin'd to pity me; Pity may nourish Kindness, I must improve that Pity: This Disguise is no ill Plot, But see! She comes, now for Dissimulation. SCENE III. Enter Teraminta. Ter. Say, venerable Father, Have you seen Two Shepherds pass this way? Cra. Just by my Cave they parted; Where unperceiv'd I heard The different Stories of their Fortunes: The one Is gone a Virgin to espouse Of high Degree, and rich Possessions; The other, hapless Youth! Scorn'd by the Fair he lov'd, In deep Despair Wanders, he knows not, cares not whither. I weep for very Pity. AIR. Ter. Shall Strangers weep, and shall not I, The Cause of all his Woe? I'd freely drain these Eye-strings dry, Cou'd I his Grief forgo. Why did I treat with such Disdain, A Flame so pure and true? Why love I still, yet love in vain, Where Hate is only due? [Exit. SCENE IV. Cratander solus. Cra. Who wou'd weep and kneel To heighten Vanity, And purchase Scorn, When dear Deceit Has such prevailing Charms, Under this veil of Sanctity? I'll prosecute my Scheme; Determin'd to enjoy her, And supplant my Rival. AIR. How sweet is deceiving, How pow'rful its Charms; When Beauty believing, We lure to our Arms? When tir'd of repining, We languish in vain; With Art and Designing, The Conquest we gain. [Exit. SCENE V. A Camp. Xarino in a warlike Habit. Xar. Thus rous'd as from some strange illusive Dream, I wake astonisht, and with Shame reflect, Upon my Follies past, O Teraminta! In what a maze of Error, hast thou led me? While I in Indolence by Charms inchanted, Amus'd away my life's Meridian Splendor. I shou'd have been conducting shining Legions, In all the splendid Pomp of War array'd; And not have suffer'd these sad Revolutions, To fill my Country with such Scenes of Sorrow. My Father Captive! O Distracting Thought! But 'tis resolv'd, I'll amply now atone, Preserve his sacred Life, or lose my own. AIR. For Glory and Fame, For a Conqueror's Name, I pant with an Ardor unknown. My Country I'll save, Th'Enslaver enslave, And restore to my Father his Throne. SCENE VI. A Grove. Ardelia sola. Ard. What is become of my Cratander? O boding Heart! Why dost thou fill my Soul with sad Conjecture He's surely slain, Or in the rage of Jealousy Has kill'd his Rival, And therefore fled. What Scenes of Sorrow Take Birth from this pernicious Beauty? And must she triumph thus? Rob me of my Peace, Of him I love. And shall I suffer tamely? No, If my Cratander's dead, I kill her for his sake; If he still lives, I kill her for my own. But die she must; farewel Compassion! AIR. Vengeance inspires me, Jealousy fires me, And Pity far is flown; No Fears shall quell me, No Tears repel me, She must for all atone. [Exit. SCENE VII. A Prison. Gozanes. Goz. Curst Fate of War! Uncertainty of Grandeur! No Hopes of Liberty for lost Gozanes! Here must I linger out a wretched Life; Wretched indeed! for such a train of Sorrows, Demonstrate me but born to know distress. Surely some Vengeance from offended Heav'n, Pursues me to the utmost Verge of Woe. Oh ye vindictive Powers! that punish me, Spare my Xarino, spare my hapless Son! But lives he to be spar'd? that's the sad Question. AIR. Let me behold my Son once more, In life's sweet Bloom array'd; Or waft me to th'Elysian Shore, To clasp his darling Shade. On me your destin'd Vengeance shew, Let him be spar'd and blest; Pity a wretched Father's Woe, And grant his last Request. [Exit. SCENE VIII Teraminta. AIR. Ter. Come, O Sleep, my Eyelids close, Lull my Soul to soft Repose, Downy Slumbers sooth to Rest, Ease the Torments of my Breast. [Falls into a Slumber. SCENE IX. Enter Ardelia. Ard. How sweet she looks? How lovely ev'n in Sleep? Too lovely to my Sorrow: Who wou'd now imagine, A Form so fair shou'd cause so much Distress? Where's my Resentment now? Coward Ardelia! Rise up, my Injuries; I call for Rage, and Pity comes. Begone! fond Pity. [Offers to strike. Ter. O Xarino! How coud'st thou leave me thus? Ard. Who cou'd kill her? It must not be. Ter. Base Man! to wed another, After such Vows to me. Ard. Strange, and almost incredible; My own sad Fate. Ter. O shield me, Heav'n! what's that? [Waking. Ard. A Friend, a poor afflicted Friend. Ter. No, you're a Man, All Men are false: As such I shun you. [Exit. SCENE X. Ardelia sola. Ard. Stay, Teraminta; But alas! she's gone. How hapless are we both? Kind Heav'n preserve her Reason, But drive me mad in Pity, That I may have no Sense of Sorrow; Or end my Life, And with it all my Misery. AIR. The Frantick know No Thought of Woe, No Sense of Fear or Smart; Reflection wings Ten thousand Strings, With Anguish to the Heart. What they have lost, We to our Cost, But for our Torment keep; Their Cares forgot, They feel 'em not; But laugh while others weep. [Exit. SCENE XI. Teraminta meeting Cratander. Cra. Where flies my Fair? Ter. From Man, false Man. Cra. All are not false; Cratander loves you. Ter. I ought indeed, But can't return that Love; And yet I pity him. Cra. O speak once more, Add Love to Pity, And place him prostrate at your Feet. Ter. 'Tis now too late. Cra. O no, suppose him here; Nay more, behold him, And reward his Passion. [Discovers himself and seizes her Hand Ter. Is this your Artifice? This unexpected Boldness, Makes me repent my Pity. Cra. Then I repent my cowardly Delays: And since Intreaty's vain, Force shall assist my Wishes. Ter. Unhand me Ravisher. Cra. You plead in vain, Consent can only soften me. [Bearing her off. SCENE XII. Enter Ardelia. Ard. O Villain, Villain! Cra. Is this your Champion, Your Minion Shepherd? Xarino left in time So false a Creature. Ard. Cratander! more untimely left, An injur'd constant Maid. Cra. Ha! dost thou brave me? Now by my Love, nay, by my Rage, Unarm'd I dare thy Fury. [Disarms her. Now busy Interrupter of my Bliss, Thus I reward thy Insolence. [Offers to kill her. Ard. Strike home, and pierce a Heart You have already broken. Ardelia from that Hand Receives her Death with Pleasure. Cra. Ardelia! Amazement seizes me! Shame and Remorse confound meâ To both I kneel, For I have injur'd both; But if the strictest Penitence Can merit Pardon, Behold a Convert. Here I swear, I'll ne'er desist till I've restor'd Xarino to his Teraminta. Will that atone? Ter. It will, it will, Lead me to my Xarino; Unweary'd round the World I follow. Cra. Now, my Ardelia, My future Constancy Shall make amends for my past Falshood. Ard. O unexpected Blessing! AIR for three Voices. Cra. No more I'll rove, No more I'll range But ever love, And never change. Ard. No longer rove, No longer range, Give Love for Love In sweet Exchange. Ter. Oh! who wou'd rove, Oh! who wou'd range, And constant Love for Falshood change. If false or pure the Lover's Flame, Their Joys as sure will prove the same. The End of the Second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SCENE, The Camp. Xarino, with a Letter. Xarino. This Letter from my faithful Friend Cratander, Brings Information of such monstrous Deeds, As stagger ev'n Credulity it self: Oh, Teraminta! Why did I, or indeed, why do I love thee? Yet spite of all my past, and present Suff'rings; So firmly art thou rooted in my Heart, From thence I cannot tear theeâ AIR. O Cupid, why art thou pursuing Such endless Designs on my Heart, To make me so fond of my Ruin, And doat on the Cause of my Smart? In vain do I strive to remove her, Affection to Reason is blind; In spite of her Failings I love her, She's charming, tho' false and unkind. SCENE II. Enter Cratander. Cra. Say, what happy Accident, Brings my dear Friend thus apt to his Xarino? But why this Posture? Cra. O! embrace me not, Wou'd you contain a Scorpion in your Arms? Xar. Thou art no Scorpion, but my Bosom Friend. Cra. The more you call me Friend, the more you wound me: Do Justice to your self and Teraminta, And call me Traitor, Villain as I am. Xar. Amazement! Riddles! give 'em Explanation. You talk'd of Teraminta, what of her? Yet name her not. Cra. I cannot without Shame. Xar. Your Letter so inform'd me. Cra. Cursed Letter! False in each Article as she is true. Xar. Then Teraminta is not false. Cra. O, no! She's Truth it self; all Constancy and Love. I've such a Scene of Villany to disclose, Will make you idolize her very Name, And hate Cratander's. Xar. No, you've giv'n such Joy, In affirmation of my Charmer's Constancy; Were your Offences numerous as the Stars, They're all abolish'd. Cra. Most amazing Goodness! I dedicate my residue of Life To merit this Forgiveness. Xar. No more my Friend; If you wou'd speak to please me, speak of Love, Of Truth, of Constancy, and Teraminta. AIR. Laugh ye Valleys, smile ye Hills, Gently flow ye Crystal Rills, Tell it all the Groves around, Teraminta's constant found! Chaste and faithful as she's fair, Heav'n and Nature's Pride and Care; Virtue's Lustre crowns her Charms, Waft me Zephyrs to her Arms. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Teraminta, Ardelia. Ter. Where is Xarino? Ard. Cratander not return'd; Makes me conclude some Accident delays The Prince's coming. Ter. The Prince? What Prince? Ard. 'Tis time to undeceive you. Xarino, whom you thought an humble Shepherd Is a most potent Prince. Ter. The worse for me! Wou'd he were still a Shepherd; Ambition now will rob me of his Heart. Ard. O think not so. Ter. I know not what to think, I'm all Perplexity. Ard. I fly to learn the Cause; And bring you news of Consolation. SCENE IV. Teraminta sola. Ter. Sure I was born for Misery; To taste the Bitterness of Life, Without the least allay of Sweetness. Ardelia is most happy, I most wretched; And yet I envy not Ardelia. Why grieve I then? Not for her Happiness, But for my own Misfortune. AIR. Thus dash'd by the Billows, The Seamen explore, All under green Willows The Shepherds on Shore; To see them contented What Joy can it be, To Wretches tormented, And tost on the Sea. SCENE V. Cratander, Teraminta. Cra. The Prince, fair Teraminta, begs excuse, Sudden Prevention stops his wisht Approach, Or he'd attend you. Ter. Talk not of Princes to a Shepherdess, Nor mock a wretched Maid. Cra. Misapprehension O'ersways your Patience, hear me, I beseech you. Ter. Wou'd I had never heard or him, or you. Cra. And wou'd to Heav'n that neither he or I Had e'er beheld those most destructive Charms. You wrong the Prince, too haughty Shepherdess He's but too constant. Ter. Constancy and Man! Are Contradictions so directly manifest; The very mention is ridiculous. Cra. Then you'll not hear. Ter. I've heard too much already. [Exit. Cra. And so have IâI'll carry him your Answer. AIR. Adieu, adieu, You'll scorn, you'll rue, And find him true, When 'tis too late; Not worth the Care, Of Cuba's Heir; Insulting Fair! Lamentâyour Fate. [Exit. SCENE VII. Gozanes, led to Execution. AIR. Goz. Farewel Life, thou Vale of Woe, 'Tis with Pleasure that I go, Round Death's gloomy Realms to range, Worse can never be the Change. SCENE VIII. Xarino and his Party rescue him. Xar. O live, my Father, live! Goz. Transporting Sight! Why do these joyous Tears restrain my Eyes, From fondly gazing on this darling Object? Xar. I bring not only Liberty and Life, But double Empire to my dearest Father. Goz. Compar'd to thee, Life, Liberty, and Empire Merit not mention. Goz. Compar'd to thee, Life, Liberty, and Empire Merit not mention. AIR. Freedom, Empire, Life obtain'd, And a dearer Son regain'd; So much Joy succeeding Woe, Kings and Fathers only know. [Exeunt. SCENE IX. Cratander, Ardelia. Cra. Ardelia, I am all Astonishment At Teraminta's late Behaviour; Not hear my Message! Ard. 'Tis most strange indeed, I know she loves to Desperation. Cra. What shall I tell the Prince? Ard. Nothing, since these Mistakes Are but increas'd by Messages. Go bring him here; He's the most welcome Messenger. AIR. In the absence of her Treasure, Ev'ry Object gives Displeasure, With Impatience while she burns. Wishing still, and still lamenting, She expecting, he absenting, All her Joy to Sorrow turns. [Exit. SCENE X. Xarino, Cratander. Xar. Where is my Teraminta? Cra. Chiding your Delay, She mourns in Solitude your Absence. Xar. O bring me to my Love. Cra. Behold she comes. SCENE XI. Enter Teraminta. Xar. But why with this Reserve appears my Charmer? Why this Formality, this Air of Distance? Does my Soul's Idol think that Birth or Titles Can make the least Abatement in my Passion? No, were I Monarch of the Globe's Extent, I'm still the same, her faithful fond Xarino. Ter. So fond, and yet so dilatory: That Passion must be cool indeed, Which pleads Excuse, And parleys for Delay. Xar. If to defeat a powerful Invader, To save a Kingdom, and a Father's Life, May be a Plea for Absence, that is mine. Ter. My Fears were groundless, and my Hopes are true, Xarino's constant, and I still am happy. AIR. The Turtle lamenting The Loss of her Mate, From comfort absenting Bewails her hard Fate. But at his returning, Her Joy she renews; With Extasy burning, Around him she cooes. So I for my dearest Did languish and mourn; With Sorrow sincerest My Bosom was torn. His Truth when suspected, How great was my Grief? That Error corrected, How sweet my Relief? [Exeunt. SCENE XI. A Magnificent Hall Gozanes on the Throne. Attendants, &amp;c. Goz. Xarino has perform'd such Miracles, That not to recompense, wou'd be Ungrateful. Bid him approach, and ask his Soul's Request. Enter Xarino. My Son, to thee I owe my Life and Empire, Nor can I rest, Until I've recompens'd such great Deserts. Demand whate'er thou wilt, by yon high Heav'n, Gozanes grants it. Xar. That high Heav'n is Witness, Saving my Duty to my Royal Parent, Here is the Centre of my Soul's Ambition, The only Object of my ardent Wishes. Introducing Teraminta Goz. O bear her hence. Xar. What means my Royal Father? Goz. That Heav'n is just; there, there's the injur'd Face. Xar. Did you then bid me ask but to deny me Goz. I grant thee any thing, but do conjure this Let me ne'er see her more. Xar. We go, dread Sir, for where her Sight's offensive. Mine sure must be distasteful. AIR. With her round the World will I wander, For her ev'ry Hardship I'll bear; Distress will but make me grow fonder, While smiling she sweetens my Care. Since then my fond Passion does grieve you, O let me your Blessing implore; And then I for ever will leave you, No, never to trouble you more. Goz. Stay, I command you! Fear not, fair Nymph! but answer solemnly, How this Enamel came in your Possession. Ter. It was my dying Father's latest Token, To whose most dear Remembrance, I wear it next my Heart. Goz. Who was thy Father? Ter. A Shepherd, Sir, and of no small Possession. Goz. Rise, Princess, rise! thy Father was no Shepherd, But mighty Zantimenes King of Cuba. Thou need'st no Token to assert thy Birth; Each Feature in that Face bears strict Remembrance To the dear injur'd Monarch, for whose sake A Train of Vengeance has thus long pursu'd me; But as I robb'd thy Father of his Throne, To thee I yield it. [Kneels. Ter. Rise, Sir, and spare my Blushes, A greater Gift than Empire's in your Pow'r; Give me Xarino, for I ask no more. I had much rather choose to be your Daughter, Than to be Empress of the World's Extent. DUETTO. Ter. and Xar. My Treasure, my Pleasure, my Joy, and Delight, How great my Affection, thy Virtue how bright! Fly Jealousy, fly, and Suspicion adieu, For happy am I, as my Charmer is true. Goz. O wondrous Force of Providence divine! That still prevails in spite of Mens Design; How justly did it punish my Offence, How richly does it crown my Penitence? The Sceptre now resumes its rightful Place, And mingles mine with Xantimenes' Race. SCENE XII. Enter Cratander, and Ardelia. Cra. We come to share your Joy, and to congratulate This happy Reconcilement. Xar. Cratander, now our Cares are at an end One happy Day our Nuptial Joys shall blend. And may the fair Ardelia prove to thee, As dear as Teraminta is to me. CHORUS. Joy surrounding, Bliss abounding, Round our Hearts with Transports glow; Ev'ry Treasure, Ev'ry Pleasure, We can wish or Heav'n bestow. FINIS.</field>
