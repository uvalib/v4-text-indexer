      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Pedro IV.,, King of Arragon. Don Mendo Torellas, his Minister. Donna Violante, Mendo's Daughter. Elvira, her Maid. Don Lope de Urrea. Donna Blanca, his Wife. Don Lope, their Son. Beatrice, their Servant. Don Guillen, a Friend of Don Lope's. Vicente, Young Lope's Servant. Robbers, Officers, Royal Suite, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. A Mountain Pass near Saragossa. Shot within. Then enter Don Mendo and Violante pursued by Robbers, among whom is Vicente. Men. Villains, let steel or bullet do their worst, I'll die ere yield. Viol. Heav'n help us! Robber I. Fool, to strive Against such oddsâupon their own ground too, Red with the blood of hundreds like yourselves. Vic. Come, sir, no more ado; But quietly give my young madam up, Nice picking for our captain. Men. Not while a drop of blood is in my body. Robbers. Here's at you then! Viol. My father! (As the Robbers attack Mendo, enter Don Lope.) Lope. How now? whom have you here? Vic. Oh, noble captain, We found this lady resting from the sun Under the trees, with a small retinue, Who of course fled. All but this ancient gentleman, who still Holds out against us. Lope (to Mendo). What can you expect Against such numbers? Men. Not my life, but death. You come in timeâ Upon my knees I do beseech of you (kneels) No other mercy save of instant death To both of us. Lope. Arise! you are the first Has mov'd me to the mercy you decline. This lady isâyour wife? Men. My only daughter! Viol. In spirit as in blood. If by his death You think to make you masters of my life, Default of other weapon, with these hands I'll cease the breath of life, or down these rocks Dash myself headlong. Lope. Lady, calm yourself; Your beauty has subdued an angry devil One like yourself first rais'd within my soul. Your road lies whither, sir? Men. To Saragossa. Where if I could requiteâ Lope. Your name? Men. Don Mendo Torellas, after a long embassage To Paris, Rome, and Naples, summon'd back By Pedro, king of Arragonâwith whom If't be (as oft) some youthful petulance, Calling for justice or revenge at home, Drives you abroad to these unlawful courses, I pledge my wordâ Lope. Alas, sir, I might hail Your offer could I hope that your deserts, However great, might cancel my account Of ill-deserving. But indeed my crimes Have gather'd so in number, and in weight, And condemnationâcommitted, some of them, To stave away the very punishment They must increase at last; others, again, In the sheer desperation of forgiveness That all had heap'd upon meâ Men. Nay, nay, nay; Despair not; trust to my good offices; In pledge of which here, now, before we part, I swear to make your pardon the first boon I'll ask for or accept at the king's hand. Your name? Lope. However desperate, and asham'd To tell it, you shall hear itâand my story. Retire! (To the Robbers, who exeunt.) Don Mendo, I am Lope, son Of Lope de Urrea, of some desert, At least in virtue of my blood. Men. Indeed! Urrea and myself were, I assure you, Intimate friends of old,âanother tie, If wanting one, to bind me to your service. Lope. I scarce can hope it, sir; if I, his son, Have so disgrac'd him with my evil ways, And so impoverisht him with my expenses, Were you his friend, you scarcely can be mine. And yet, were I to tell you all, perhaps I were not all to blame. Men. Come, tell me all; 'Tis fit that I should hear it. Viol. I begin To breathe again. Lope. Then listen, sir. My father in his youth, As you perhaps may know, but why I know not, Held off from marriage; till, bethinking him, Or warn'd by others, what a shame it were So proud a name should die for want of wearer, In his late years he took to wife a lady Of blameless reputation, and descent As noble as his own, but so unequal In years, that she had scarcely told fifteen When age his head had whiten'd with such snows As froze his better judgment. Men. Ay, I know Too wellâtoo well! (Aside.) Lope. Long she repell'd his suit, Feeling how ill ill-sorted years agree; But, at the last, before her father's will She sacrific'd her own. Oh sacrifice That little lacks of slaughter! So, my father Averse from wedlock's self, and she from him, Think what a wedlock this must be, and what The issue that was like to come of it! While other sons cement their parents' love, My birth made but a wider breach in mine. Just in proportion as my mother lov'd Her boy, my father hated himâyes, hated, Even when I was lisping at his knees That little language charms all fathers' hearts. Neglecting me himself, as I grew up He neither taught, nor got me taught, to curb A violent nature, which by love or lash May even be corrected in a wolf: Till, as I grew, and found myself at large, Spoilt both by mother's love and father's hate, I took to evil company, gave rein To every passion as it rose within, Wine, dice, and womenâwhat a precipice To build the fabric of a life upon! Which, when my father Saw tottering to its fall, he strove to train The tree that he had suffer'd to take root In vice, and grow up crookedâall too late! Though not revolting to be ruled by him, I could not rule myself. And so we liv'd Both in one house, but wholly apart in soul, Only alike in being equally My mother's misery. Alas, my mother! My heart is with her still! Why, think, Don Mendo, That, would she see me, I must creep at night Muffled, a tip-toe, like a thief, to her, Lest he should know of it! why, what a thing That such a holy face as filial love Must wear the mask of theft! But to sum up The story of my sorrows and my sins That have made me a criminal, and him Almost a beggar;â In the full hey-day of my wilfulness There liv'd a lady near, in whom methought Those ancient enemies, wit, modesty, And beauty, all were reconcil'd; to her, Casting my coarser pleasures in the rear, I did devote myselfâfirst with mute signs, Which by and by began to breathe in sighs, And by and by in passionate words that love Toss'd up all shapeless, but all glowing hot, Up from my burning bosom, and which first Upon her willing ears fell unreprov'd, Then on her heart, which by degrees they wore More than I us'd to say her senseless threshold Wore by the nightly pressure of my feet. She heard my story, pitied me With her sweet eyes; and my unruly passion, Flusht with the promise of first victory, Push'd headlong to the last; not knowing, fool! How in love's world the shadow of disappointment Exactly dogs the substance of success. In fine, one night I stole into her house, Into her chamber; and with every vow Of marriage on my tongue; as easy then To utter, as thereafter to forswear, When in the very jewel I coveted Very compliance seem'd to make a flaw That made me careless of it when possess'd. From day to day I put our marriage off With false pretence, which she at last suspecting, Falsely continued seeming to believe, Till she had got a brother to her side, (A desperate man then out-law'd, like myself, For homicide,) who, to avenge her shame, With other two waylaid me on a night When as before I unsuspectingly Crept to her house; and set upon me so, All three at once, I just had time to parry Their thrusts, and draw a pistol, which till then They had not seen, whenâ Voices (within). Fly! Away! Away! Enter Vicente. Lope. What is the matter now? Vic. Captain! Lope. Well, speak. Vic. We must be off; the lady's retinue Who fled have rous'd the soldiery, and with them Are close upon our heels. We've not a moment. Lope. Then up the mountain! Men. Whither I will see They shall not follow you; and take my word I'll not forget my promise. Lope. I accept it. Men. Only, before we part, give me some token, The messenger I send may travel with Safe through your people's hands. Lope (giving a dagger). This then. Men. A dagger? An evil-omen'd pass-word. Lope. Ah, Don Mendo, What has a wretched robber got to give Unless some implement of death! And see, The wicked weapon cannot reach your hand, But it must bite its master's. (His hand bleeding.) Ill-omen'd as you say! Voices (within). Away! Away! Vic. They're close upon us! Viol. O quick! begone! My life hangs on a thread While yours is in this peril. Lope. That alone Should make me fly to save it. Farewell, lady. Farewell, Don Mendo. Men. and Viol. Farewell! Lope. What strange things One sun between his rise and setting brings! [Exit. Men. Let us anticipate, and so detain The soldiers. That one turn of Fortune's wheel Years of half-buried memory should reveal! Viol. Could I believe that crime should ever be So amiable! How fancy with us plays, And with one touch colours our future days! [Exeunt severally. Scene II. An Audience Hall in the Palace of Pedro, King of Arragon.âEnter Don Lope De Urrea, and Don Guillen. Guil. Such bosom friends, sir, as from infancy Your son and I have been, I were asham'd, You being in such trouble, not to offer My help and consolation. Tell me aught That I can serve you in. Urr. Believe me, sir, My heart most deeply thanks your courtesy. When came you to the city? Guil. Yesterday, From Naples. Urr. Naples? Guil. To advance a suit I have in Arragon. Urr. I too am here For some such purpose; to beseech the king A boon I doubt that he will never grant. Guil. Ev'n now his Highness comes. Enter King Pedro and Train. Urr. So please your Majesty, listen to one, Of whom already you have largely heardâ Don Lope de Urrea. King. Oh! Don Lope! Urr. I come not hither to repeat in words The purport of so many past petitions, My sorrows now put on a better face Before your Highness' presence. I beseech you To hear me patiently. King. Speak, Urrea, speak! Urr. Speak if I can, whose sorrow rising still Clouds its own utterance. My liege, my son, Don Lope, lov'd a lady here; seduc'd her By no feign'd vows of marriage, but compell'd By me, who would not listen to a suit Without my leave contracted, put it off From day to day, until the lady, tired Of a delay that argued treachery, Engag'd her brother in the quarrel; who With two companions set upon my son One night to murder him. The lad, whose mettle Would never brook affront, nor car'd for odds, Drew on all three; slew oneâa homicide That nature's common law of self-defence Permits. The others fled, and set on him The officers of justice, one of whom In his escape he struckâ A self-defence against your laws I own Not so to be excus'dâthen fled himself Up to the mountains. I must needs confess He better had deserv'd an after-pardon By lawful service in your camp abroad Than aggravating old offence at home, By lawless plunder; but your Highness knows It is an ancient law of honour here In Arragon, that none of noble blood In mortal quarrel quit his native ground. But to return. The woman, twice aggriev'd, Her honour and her brother lost at once, (For him it was my son slew of the three,) Now seeks to bring her sorrows into port: And pitying my grey hairs and misery, Consents to acquit my son on either count, Providing I supply her wherewithal To hide her shame within some holy house; Which, straiten'd as I am, (that, by my troth, I scarce, my liege, can find my daily bread,) I have engag'd to do; not only this, But, in addition to the sum in hand, A yearly incomeâwhich to do, I now Am crept into my house's poorest rooms, And, (to such straits may come nobility!) Have let for hire what should become my rank And dignity to an old friend, Don Mendo Torellas, who I hear returns to-day To Saragossa. It remains, my liege, That, being by the plaintiff's self absolv'd, My son your royal pardon only needs; Which if not he nor I merit ourselves, Yet let the merits of a long ancestry, Who swell your glorious annals with their names Writ in their blood, plead for us not in vain; Pity the snows of age that misery Now thaws in torrents from my eyes; yet more, Pity a noble ladyâmy wifeâhis motherâ Who sits bow'd down with sorrow and disgrace In her starv'd house. King. This is a case, Don Lope, For my Chief Justice, not for me. Urr. Alas! How little hope has he who, looking up To dove-ey'd mercy, sees but in her place Severely-sworded justice! King. Is't not fit That the tribunal which arraign'd the crime Pronounce the pardon also? Urr. Were it so, I know not where to look for that tribunal, Or only find it speechless, since the death Of Don Alfonso. King. His successor's name This day will be announc'd to Arragon. Urr. Yet let a father's tearsâ King. They might indeed The marble heart of justice make to bleed. [Exeunt King, Don Guillen, and Train. Urr. And thus to satisfy the exigence Of public estimation, one is forc'd To sacrifice entreaty and estate For an ill son. Yet had but this petition been inflam'd With love, that love of his had lit in me, My prayer had surely prosper'd. But 'tis done, Fruitless or not: well done, for Blanca's sake; Poor Blanca, though indeed she knows it not, And scarcely would believe itâ But who comes here?âthe friend of better days, Don Mendo! I would hide me from his eye, But, oh indignity, his ancient friend, Equal in birth and honour to himself, Must now, reduc'd to't by a shameless son, Become his tavern-keeper! For the present I may hold backâthe King too! come to meet And do him honour. Enter, meeting, King, with Train, and Don Mendo. Men. My royal master, let me at your feet Now and for everâ King. Rise, Don Mendo, rise, Chief Justice of all Arragon. Men. My liege, How shall I rise with such a weight of honour And solemnest responsibility, As you have laid upon my neck! King. 'Tis long Since we have met. How fare you? Men. How but well, On whom your royal favour shines so fair! King. Enough. You must be weary. For to-day Go rest yourself, Chief Justice. And to-morrow We'll talk together. I have much to tell, And much to ask of you. Men. Your Highness knows How all my powers are at your sole command, And only well employ'd in doing it. [Exit King with Train. Urr. If it be true that true nobility Slowly forgets what once it has esteem'd, I think Don Mendo will not turn away From Lope de Urrea. Men. My old friend! I must forget myself, as well as honour, When I forget the debt I owe your love. Urr. For old acquaintance then I kiss your hand; And on two other counts. First, as your host, You know, on your arrival; be assur'd That I shall do my best to entertain you: And, secondly, congratulating you On your new dignity, which you hardly don Before I am your suitor. Men. Oh, Don Lope, How gladly shall I serve you! Urr. This memorial I had presented to the king, and he Referr'd to his Chief Justice. Men. Oh trust to me, And to my loyal friendship in the cause. Urr. A son of mine, Don Mendoâ Men. Nay, no moreâ I am appriz'd of all. Urr. I know that men Think my heart harden'd toward my only son. It might have been so; not, though, till my son's Was flint to me. O Mendo, by his means My peace of mind, estate, and good repute Are gone for ever! Men. Nay, be comforted: I fill a post where friendship well can grant What friendship fairly asks. Think from this hour That all is ended. Not for your sake only, But for your son's; to whom (you soon shall hear The whole strange history) I owe my life, And sure shall not be slack to save his own. All will be well. Come, let us to your house, Whither, on coming to salute the king, I sent my daughter forward. Urr. I rejoice To think how my poor Blanca will rejoice To do her honour. You remember Blanca? Men. Remember her indeed, and shall delight To see her once again. (Aside.) O lying tongue, To say so, when the heart beneath would fain We had not met, or might not meet again! Scene III. A Room in Urrea's House.âEnter Blanca and Violante in travelling dress, meeting. Blan. How happy am I that so fair a guest Honours my house by making it her own, And me her servant! To welcome and to wait on Violante I have thus far intruded. Viol. Nay, Donna Blanca, Mine is the honour and the happiness, Who, coming thus to Arragon a stranger, Find such a home and hostess. Pardon me That I detain you in this ante-room, My own not ready yet. Blan. You come indeed Before your people look'd for you. Viol. But not Before my wishes, lady, I assure you: Not minding on the mountains to encounter Another such a risk. Blan. There was a first then? Viol. So great that I assure you (and too truly, (aside) My heart yet beats with it. Blan. How was't? Viol. Why, thus: In wishing to escape the noon-day sun, That seem'd to make both air and land breathe fire, I lighted from my litter in a spot That one might almost think the flowers had chosen To tourney in, so green and smooth the sward On which they did oppose their varied crests, So fortified above with closing leaves, And all encompass'd by a babbling stream. There we sat down to rest; when suddenly A company of robbers broke upon us, And would have done their worst, had not as suddenly A young and gallant gentleman, their captain, Arrested them, and kindlyâbut how now? Why weep you, Donna Blanca? Blan. Weeping, yes, My sorrows with your ownâBut to your tale. Viol. Nay, why should I pursue it if my trouble Awake the memory of yours? Blan. Your father, Saw he this youth, this robber cavalier Who grac'd disgrace so handsomely? Viol. Indeed, And owes his life and honour to him. Blan. Oh! He had aton'd for many a foregone crime By adding that one more! But I talk wild; Pardon me, Violante. I have an anguish ever in my breast At times will rise, and sting me into madness; Perhaps you will not wonder when you hear This robber was my son, my only son, Whose wicked ways have driv'n him where he is, From home, and law, and love! Viol. Forgive me, lady, I mind me nowâhe told usâ But I was too confus'd and terrified To heed to names. Else credit meâ Enter Urrea and Mendo. Urr. Largess! a largess, wife! for bringing you Joy and good fortune to our house, from which They have so long been banisht. Blan. Long indeed! Urr. So long, methinks, that coming all at once They make me lose my manners. (To Violante.) This fair hand Must, as I think it will, my pardon sign; Inheriting such faculty. Oh, Blanca, I must not let one ignorant moment slipâ You know not half our joy. Don Mendo, my old friend, and our now guest, Grac'd at the very threshold by the King With the Chief-Justiceship of Arragon, Points his stern office with an act of mercy, By pardoning your Lopeâwhom we now Shall have once more with us, I trust, for ever. Oh join with me in thanking him! Blan. I am glad, Don Mendo, that we meet under a roof Where I can do you honour. For my son, I must suppose from what your daughter says, You would, without our further prayer or thanks, Have done as you have done. Mend. Too trueâI knowâ And you still better, ladyâthat, all done, I am your debtor still. Enter Elvira. Elv. Madam, your room is ready. Viol. May I then Retire? Blan. If I may wait upon you thither. Urr. Nay, nay, 'tis I that as a grey-hair'd page Must do that office. Mend. Granted, on condition That I may do as much for Donna Blanca. Viol. As master of the house, I must submit Without condition. [Exeunt Violante and Urrea. Blan. You were going, sir?â Mend. To wait upon you, Blanca. Blan. Nay, Don Mendo, Least need of that. Mend. Oh, Blanca, Heaven knows How much I have desir'd to talk with you! Blan. And to what purpose, sir? No longer in your powerâperhaps, nor willâ To do as well as talk. Mend. If but to say How to my heart it goes seeing you still As sad as when I left you years ago. Blan. âAs sad?âas when you left me years agoââ I understand you notâam not aware I ever saw you till to-day. Mend. Ah, Blanca, Have pity! Blan. Nay, Don Mendo, let us cease A conversation, uselessly begun, To end in nothing. If your memory, Out of some dreamt-of fragments of the past, Attach to me, the past is dead in time; Let it be buried in oblivion. Mend. Oh, with what courage, Blanca, do you wield Your ready woman's wit! Blan. I know not why You should say that. Mend. But I know. Blan. If't be so, Agree with me to say no more of it. Mend. But how? Blan. By simple silence. Mend. How be silent Under such pain? Blan. By simple suffering. Mend. Oh, Blanca, how learn that? Blan. Of meâand thus. Beatrice! Enter Beatrice. Beat. Madam? Blan. Light Don Mendo to His chamber. Thus be further trouble sped. Mend. Nay, rather coals of fire heap'd on my head! [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. A Room in Urrea's House.âEnter Urrea and Blanca on one side, and Lope and Vicente on the other. Lope. Thrice blessed be the day, that brings me back In all humility and love, my father, To kiss your feet once more. Urr. Rise up, my son, As welcome to your parents as long lookt for. Rise and embrace me. Lope. Till I have your hand I scarcely dare. Urr. Then take it, Lopeâthereâ And may God make thee virtuous as thy father Can pray for thee. Thy mother tooâ Lope. O madam, I scarcely dare with anguish and repentance Lift up my eyes to those I have made weep So many bitter tearsâ Blan. You see, my son, You keep them weeping stillânot bitter tears, But tears of joyâOh, welcome home again! Vic. Where, is there any room for a poor devil Who has done penance upon rock and water This many a day, and much repents him of His former sins? Urr. What you alive too? Vic. Yes, sir, This saddle's pad, (showing Lope,) or, if you like, the beast That bears the saddleâor, by another rule,â That where the cat jumps also goes her tail. Lope (to his father). You see, sir, in such godly company I must repent. Vic. Why, devil take'tâ Urr. What, swearing? Vic. But some poor relic of our former life That yet will stick. Madam, permit me, If not to kiss your hand, nor ev'n your feet, At least the happy ground on which they walk. Blan. Rise, rise. How can I less than welcome one Who has so loyally stood by my son, Through evil and through good. Vic. A monument As one might say, madam, ad perpetuam Fidelis AmicitiÃ¦ Memoriam. Enter Beatrice. Beat. What! is my master home? Then, by the saints, Saving your presence, and before your faces, I must embrace him. Lope. Thanks, good Beatrice. Urr. You see how all rejoice to see you, Lope, But none so more than I; believe't. But now 'Tis time you wait on Mendo, and acknowledge The kindness he has done us. See, Beatrice, If he be in his room, or busy there. [Exit Beatrice. Meanwhile, my son, I crave one patient hearing To what I have to say. Vic. Now for a lecture. Lope. Silence, sir! Coming here, we must expect And bear such things. Pray speak, sir. Urr. You see, Lope, (And doubtless must have heard of it before,) In what a plight we are: my property, What yet remains of it, embroil'd and hamper'd, And all so little, that this last expense, Of getting (as I have) your Estifania, Who has already cost us all so much, Into a convent; to do this, I say, I have been forc'd to let my house for hire To my old friend; yea, almost, I assure you, To beg from door to door. Enough of that. 'Tis done; and you are now at last restor'd To home, and stationâwealth I cannot sayâ But all is well that ends well. All I ask, (And 'tis with tears and with a broken voice I ask it: I would ask it on my knees If these white hairs forbade not such descent,) That from this day, in pity to us allâ Perhaps in gratitudeâyou would repent Your past excess; yea, surfeited with that, Would henceforth tame your headlong passions down Into a quiet current. Help me, son, Restore the shaken credit of our house, And showâlet us both showâthat misery Has taught us not in vain. Let us be friends Henceforth; no rivalry of love or hate Between us; each doing what in him lies To make what may remain of life to each Happy and honourable. On my part I stake a father's love and tenderness; And will not you as freely on your side Wager your filial obedience? Your father asks, implores you. Oh, consider You may not always have a friend in need To rescue you as now: nay, disappoint His mercy and again provoke the laws He now remits, that friend may turn to foe And sacrifice the life he vainly spar'd. Vic. There only wants, âin sÃ¦cula sÃ¦culorum,â To finish off with. Lope. Sir, I promise you Amendment, that shall make the past a foil To set the future off. Enter Mendo. Men. I come in time To vouch fulfilment of so fair a vow. Lope. Oh, sirâ Men. I knew you on your road to me; Your errand too; and thus much have forestall'd Of needless courtesy. Lope. Pray God, reward you With such advancement in your prince's love As envy, the court Hydra, shall not hiss, But general love and acclamation Write in gold letters in our history, For ages and for ages. Sir, your hand! Men. My heart, my heart, you shame me by your thanks, For service that the veriest churl had paid For what you did me, Lope. Why, I'm your debtor still. But now, enough! I cannot steal more time from business; The king expects me. Urr. I too must abroad. Lope. Would I could wait on bothâbut, as it is, I think my father's self would waive his right, In favour of our common benefactor. Urr. Indeed, indeed, I do rejoice you should. [Exit with Blanca. Men. And I, not knowing if your choice be right, Know that I would not lose you for a moment, So glad your presence makes me. [Exit with Lope. Vic. Vicente's flirtation with the two Criadas, and its upshot, is familiar to English play-goers in the comedy of âThe Wonder.â Beatrice! Beatrice! Beat. Well? Vic. Think you not, now that our principals are fairly out of the way, you owe me a kiss on my arrival? Beat. Ay, hot from the oven. Vic. Ah Beatrice! if you only knew what heart-aches you've cost me. Beat. You indeed, robbing and murdering, and I don't know what beside, up in the mountains! and then my new madam that's come with you, Donna Violante; with her fine Elvira,âI know, sir, when your master was courting his mistress, youâ Vic. Now, my own Beatrice, if you could only know what you are talking of as well as I, how little jealousy could such a creature as that give you! Beat. Wellâbut why? Vic. Not a woman at all, neither maid nor mermaidâ Why, didn't I catch her with all those fine locks of hers clean off her head? Beat. Clean off her head! Vic. The woman's bald. Beat. Bald! Vic. As my hand! besides, all that fine white chevaux-defrise that ornaments her gums. Beat. Well? Vic. All sham. Beat. What, my fine madam there false teeth! Vic. Oh, and half a dozen villainous things I could tell you, did it become a gentleman to tell tales of ladies. But see, here is master coming back. Beat. Good bye then, for the present, Vicente. False teeth and a wig! [Exit. Enter Don Lope. Lope. Vicente, have you by any chance seen Violante? Vic. Not that I know of, sir; she may however have passed without my knowing her. Lope. Vicente still! As if it were possible one who had once seen such beauty could ever forget it. Vic. Why, sir, if her maid Elvira happened to be by her sideâ Lope. Fool! Vic. Pray is it impossible in the system of things that the maid should be handsomer than the mistress? Lope. Oh could I but see her! Vic. Take care, take care, sir. Beware of raising the old devilâand now we are but just out of the frying-panâ Lope. Beware you, sir! I tell you I ill liked my father's lecture; do not you read me another. It were best that no one crossed me, or by heaven!âBut who comes here? Vic. Don Guillen de Azagra. Enter Don Guillen. Lope. What? Ask what reward you will of me, Vicente. Don Guillen de Azagra back again! Guil. And could not wait a moment, hearing you Were also back, Don Lope, till I found you, As well to give you welcome as receive it. Lope. Our old affection asks for nothing less On both sides. Oh, you are welcome! Guil. Well can he come, who comes half dead between Dead hope and quickening passion! Lope. How is that? Guil. Why, you remember how three years ago I went to Naplesâto the wars there? Lope. Yes, We parted, I remember, sadly enough On both sides, in the Plaza del Aseo. Unconsciously divining the sad days That were about to dawn on one of us. Guil. Nay, upon both. I am no stranger, Lope, To your misfortunes; and Heav'n knows I felt them! But they are over, Heav'n be thankt! mine yet Are sadly acting. You can help me now, If not to conquer, to relieve them. Lope. Ay, And will strain every nerve for you. But first Must hear your story. Guil. WellâI went to Naples, Where, as you know, our King by force of arms Was eager to revenge the shameful death Of Norandino, whom the king of Naples Had on the scaffold treacherously murder'd. Of which, and Naples too, I say no more Than this; that, entering the city, I saw a lady in whom the universe Of beauty seem'd to centre; as it might be The sun's whole light into a single beam, The heavenly dawn into one drop of dew, Or the whole breathing spring into one rose. You will believe I lov'd not without cause, When you have heard the lady that I speak of Isâ Vic. Donna Violante! Lope. Knave and fool! Vic. Why so, sir! only for telling you I saw the lady coming this way; but, I suppose seeing people here, she has turned back. Lope. Will you retire awhile, Don Guillen? this lady is my father's guest. Guil. (aside). Beside, she might be angry finding me here. [Exit. Lope. 'Fore Heaven, my mind misgave me it was she he spoke of! Vic. Well, you have got the weather-gage. Tackle her now. Enter Violante and Elvira. Lope. Nay, lady, turn not back. What you, the sun I see by, to abridge my little day By enviously returning to the west As soon as ris'n, and prematurely drawing The veil of night over the blush of dawn! Oh, let me not believe I fright you now, As yesterday I did, fair Violante, Arm'd among savage rocks with savage men, From whose rude company your eyes alone Have charm'd me, and subdued for the first time A fierce, unbridled will. Viol. It were not strange, Don Lope, if my bosom trembled still With that first apparition. But in truth I had not hesitated, Had I not seen, or fancied, at your side Another stranger. Lope. Oh, a friend; and one Who spoke with me of you; nay, who retir'd Only for fear of drawing new disdain Upon old love; and left me here indeed, To speak in his behalf. Viol. Alas, Elvira, Was't not Don Guillen? Elv. Yes. Viol. Don Lope plead Another's, and Don Guillen's love! (She is going.) Lope. At least Let me attend you to my mother's door. Viol. Nay, stay, sir. Lope. Stay! and lose my life in losing This happy opportunity! Viol. Are life And opportunity the same? Lope. So far, That neither lost ever returns again. Viol. If you have aught to tell me, tell it here Before I go. Lope. Only to ask if you Confess yourself no debtor to a heart That long has sigh'd for you? Viol. You, sir, are then Pleading another's cause? Lope. I might be shy To plead in my own personâa reserve That love oft feelsâand pardons. Viol. 'Tis in vain. I will not own to an account of sighs Drawn up against me without my consent; So tell your friend; and tell him he mistakes The way to payment making you, of all, His agent in the cause. Lope. Nay, nay, but wait. Viol. No moreâAdieu! [Exit. Lope. She thought I only us'd Another's suit as cover to my own, And cunningly my seeming cunning turns Against myself. But I will after her; If Don Guillen come back, tell him, Vicente, I'll wait upon him straight. [Exit. Vic. Madam Elvira! Elv. Well, Monsieur Cut-throat? Vic. Well, you are not scared at my face now? Elv. I don't know thatâyour face remains as it was. Vic. Come, come, my queen, do me a little favour. Elv. Well, what is that? Vic. Just only die for love of me; I always make a point of never asking impossibilities of any woman. Elv. Love is out of the question! I perhaps might like you, did I not know the lengths you go with that monkey Beatrice. Vic. With whom? Elv. I say with Beatrice. Bystanders see as much, sir, as players. Vic. I with Beatrice! Lord! lord! if you only knew half what I know, Elvira, you'd not be jealous of her. Elv. Why, what do you know of her? Vic. A woman who, could she breed at all, would breed foxes and stoatsâa tolerable outside, but only, only go near herâFoh! such a breath! beside other peculiarities I don't mention out of respect to the sex. But this I tell you, one of those sparkling eyes of hers is glass, and her right leg a wooden one. Elv. Nonsense! Vic. Only you look, and see if she don't limp on one side, and squint on the other. Don Guillen (entering at one side). I can wait no longer. Don Lope (entering at the other). It is no use; she is shut up with my mother. Now for Don Guillen. Elv. They are back. Vic. We'll settle our little matter by and by. Elv. Glass eyes and wooden legs! [Exit. Lope (To Don Guillen). Forgive my leaving you so long; I have been Waiting on one who is my father's guest, The lady Violante. Guil. So sweet duty Needs no excuse. Lope. Now to pursue your storyâ Guil. Ahâwhere did I leave off? Lope. About the truce Making at Naples, when you saw a ladyâ Guil. Ay, but I must remember one thing, Lope, Most memorable of all. The ambassador Empower'd to treat on our good king's behalf Was Mendo de Torellas, whose great wisdom And justice, both grown grey in state affairs, Well fitted him for such authority; Which telling you, and telling you beside, That when the treaty made, and he left Naples, I left it too, still following in his wake The track of a fair star who went with him To Saragossa, to this very houseâ Telling you this, I tell you allâtell who My lady isâhis daughterâViolante, Before whose shrine my life and soul together Are but poor offerings to consecrate. Vic. (aside). A pretty market we have brought our pigs to! Who'll bet upon the winner? Lope. (aside). Oh confusion! But let us drain the cup at once. Don Guillen, Your admiration and devotedness Needed the addition of no name to point Their object out. But tell me, Ere I advise with you, how far your prayer Is answer'd by your deity? Guil. Alas! Two words will tellâ Lope. And those? Guil. Love unreturn'd! Or worse, return'd with hate. Vic. (aside). Come, that looks better. Guil. My love for her has now no hope, Don Lope, But in your love for me. She is your guest, And I as such, beside my joy in you, May catch a ray of herâmay win you even To plead for me in such another strain As has not yet wearied her ears in vain; Or might you not ev'n now, as she returns, Give her a letter from me; lest if first She see, or hear from others of my coming, She may condemn my zeal for persecution, And make it matter of renew'd disdain. I'll write the letter now, and bring it you Ere she be back. [Exit. Vic. (To Lope). Good bye, sir. Lope. Whither now, Vicente? Vic. To the mountainsâI am sure You'll soon be after me. Lope. I understandâ But stay awhile. True, I love Violante, and resent Don Guillen's rivalry: but he's my friendâ Confides to me a passion myself own, And cannot blame. Wait we awhile, Vicente, and perhaps A way will open through the labyrinth Without our breaking through. Vic. How glad I am To see you take 't so patiently! Now, sir, Would you be rul'dâ Lope. What then? Vic. Why simply, sir, Forget the ladyâbut a few day's flame, And thenâ Lope. Impossible! Vic. What's to be done then? Lope. I know notâBut she comes. Enter Violante. Viol. Still here, Don Lope! Lope. Ah, what in nature will its centre leave, Or, forc'd away, recoils not faster still! So rivers yearn along their murmuring beds Until they reach the sea; the pebble thrown Ever so high, still faster falls to earth; Wind follows wind, and not a flame struck out Of heavy wood or flint, but it aspires Upward at once and to its proper sphere. Viol. All good philosophy, could I but see How to apply it here. Lope. And yet, how easy! Your beauty being that to which my soul Ever flies fastest, and most slowly leaves. Viol. Surely this sudden rapture scarce agrees With what I heard before. Lope. How, Violante? Viol. Have you not haply chang'd parts in the farce, And ris'n from second character to first? Lope. My second did not please youâcome what will, Casting feign'd speech and character aside, I'll e'en speak for myself in my own person. Listen to meâDon Guillenâ Guil. (listening at the side). Just a moment To hear him plead my cause. Lope. Following your beauty, as a flower the sun, Has come from Italy to Arragon, And, as my friend, by me entreats of you To let him plead his suit. Guil. Would I could stay To hear the noble Lope plead my cause, But summon'd henceâ [Exit. Viol. Ill does your second part Excuse your ill performance of the first; One failure might be pardon'd, but two such Are scarce to be excus'd. Lope. Oh, tell me then Which chiefly needs apology! Viol. I will. First for your friend Don Guillen; bid him cease All compliment and courtship, knowing well How all has been rejected hitherto, And will hereafter, to the ruthless winds. Lope. And on the second countâmy own? Viol. How easily Out of his answer you may draw your own! Lope. Alas! Viol. For when the judge has to pronounce Sentence on two defendants, like yourselves, Whose charge is both alike, and bids the one Report his condemnation to the other; 'Tis plainâ Lope. That both must suffer? Viol. Nay, if so The judge had made one sentence serve for both. Lope. Great heavens! Guil. (listening at the side). The man dismiss'd, I'll hear the rest. Viol. Oh, let it be enough to tell you now The heart that once indeed was adamant, Resisting all impressionâbut at last Ev'n adamant you knowâ Guil. Oh, she relents! Lope. Oh, let me kiss those white hands for those words! Guil. Excellent friend! he could not plead more warmly Were't for himself. Lope. Oh for some little token To vouch, when you have vanisht from my eyes, That all was not a dream! Viol. (giving him a rose). This rose, whose hue Is of the same that should my cheek imbue! [Exit. Enter Guillen. Guil. Oh how thrice welcome is my lady's favour, Sent to me by the hand of such a friend! How but in such an attitude as this Dare I receive it? (kneels). Lope. Rise, Don Guillen, riseâ Flowers are but fading favours that a breath Can change and wither. Guil. What mean you by this? Lope. Only that though the flower in my hands Is fresh from Violante's, I must tell you It must not pass to yours. Guil. Did not I hear you Pleading my cause? Lope. You mightâ Guil. And afterwards, When I came back again, herself confess That, marble as she had been to my vows, She now relented tow'rd me! Lope. If you did, 'Twould much disprove the listener's adage. Guil. How? Lope. You set your ears to such a lucky tune, As took in all the words that made for you, But not the rest that did complete the measure. Guil. But did not Violante, when you urg'd her In my behalf, say she relented? Lope. Yes. Guil. To whom then? Lope. To myself. Vic. The cat's unbagg'd! Guil. To you! Lope. To me. Guil. Don Lope, you must see That ev'n my friendship for you scarce can stomach Such wordsâor credit them. Lope. Let him beware Who doubts my words, stomach them as he can. Guil. But 'tis a jestâ Bearing my happy fortune in your hands, You only, as old love has leave to do, Tantalize ere you give it me. Enough, Give me the rose. Lope. I cannot, being just Given to me, and for me. Guil. His it is Whose right it is, and that is mine; and I Will have it. Lope. If you can. Guil. Then follow me, Where (not in your own house) I may chastise The friendship that must needs have play'd me false One way or other. [Exit. Lope. Lead the way then, sir. Enter hurriedly Donna Blanca and Violante from opposite sides. Viol. Don Lope, what is this? Lope. Nothing, Violante. Viol. I heard your angry voices in my room, And could not helpâ Blan. And I too. O my son, Scarce home with us, and all undone already! Where are you going? Lope. No where; nothing; leave me. Viol. Tell me the quarrelâOh! I dread to hear. Lope. What quarrel, lady? let me goâyour fears Deceive you. Blan. Lope, not an hour of peace When you are here! Lope. Nay, madam, why accuse me, Before you know the cause? Enter Urrea. Urr. How now?âdisputing? Blanca and Violante too? What is it? Blan. Oh, nothing! (I must keep it from his father.) Nothingâhe quarrell'd with Vicente here, And would have beat himâand we interposed; Indeed, no more. Vic. The blame is sure to fall Upon my shoulders. Urr. Is't not very strange, Your disposition, Lope? never at peace With others or yourself. Lope. 'Tis nothing, sir. Vic. He quarrell'd with me, sir, about some money He thought he ought to have, and couldn't find In his breeches' pocket. Urr. Go, goâget you gone, knave. Vic. Always fair words from you at any rate. (Aside.) Urr. And for such trifles, Lope, you disturb My house, affright your mother and her guest With your mad passion. Lope. I can only, sir, Answer such charge by silence, and retire. Now for Don Guillen. [Exit. Blan. Oh let him not go! Urr. Why not? 'tis a good riddance. Violante, You must excuse this most unseemly riot Close to your chamber. My unruly son, When his mad passion's rous'd, neither respects Person or place. Viol. Nay, sir, I pardon him. And should, for I'm the cause! (Aside.) Blan. Ah, wretched I, Who by the very means I would prevent His going forth, have op'd the door to him. (Noise within of swords, and the voices of Lope and Guillen fighting.) Urr. What noise is that again? Enter Elvira. Elv. 'Tis in the street. Enter Beatrice. Beat. Oh, my young master fightingârun, sir, run! Urr. And 'tis for this I've sacrific'd myself! Enter fighting Lope and Guillen; Gentlemen and others trying to part them. Urr. (going between them). Hold, Lope! Hold, Don Guillen! Voices. Part them! part them! Guil. Traitor! Lope. Traitor!âI say that he's the traitor Whoeverâ Urr. Madman, can you not forbear When your grey-headed father holds your sword! Lope. And in so doing robs me of the honour I never got from him. Urr. Oh! ruffian! But if this graceless son will not respect His father, my white hairs appeal to you, Don Guillen. Guil. And shall not appeal in vainâ Out of respect, sir, for your age and name, And for these gentlemen who interpose, I shall refer the issue of this quarrel To other time and place. Lope. A good excuse For fear to hide in. Guil. Fear! Urr. Madman! again! That the respect his rival shows to me Should make my son despise him. By these heav'ns This staff shall teach you better. Lope. Strike me not! Bewareâbeware! Urr. Why, art thou not asham'dâ Lope. Yes, of respect for you that's fear of me. Guil. Whoever says or thinks what I have done Is out of fear of you, I sayâ Urr. He lies! I'll top your sentence for you. Lope. Then take thou The answer! (Strikes Urrea, who falls; confusion.) A voice. What have you done? Another. Help, help! Voices. After him, after him!âthe parricide! (Lope rushes out and the people after him.) Guil. I know not how to leave the poor old manâ Come, let me help you, sir. Urr. Parricide! May outrag'd Heaven that has seen thy crime, Witness my curse, and blast thee! Every sword That every pious hand against thee draws, Caught up into the glittering elements, Turn thunderbolt, (as every weapon shall Drawn in God's cause,) and smite thee to the centre! That sacrilegious hand which thou hast rais'd Against this snow-white headâhow shall it show Before Heaven's judgment bar; yea, how can Heav'n Ev'n now behold this deed, nor quench its sun, Veil its pure infinite blue with awful cloud, And with a terrified eclipse of things Confound the air you breathe, the light you see, The ground you walk on! Guil. Pray sir, compose yourselfâ Your cloakâyour staffâ Urr. My staff! what use is that? When it is steel that must avenge my wrong! Yet give it meâfit instrument Wherewith to chastise a rebellious childâ Ay, and he did not use his sword on me, Mark that, nor I on himâgive me my staff. Alas, alas! and I with no strength left To wield it, only as I halt along, Feeling about with it to find a grave, And knocking at deaf earth to let me in. Come me podre vengar Si aquel, que me ha de ayudar A sustentarme, me advierte Que armado en la terra dura Solo ha de irme aprovechando De aldaba, con que ir llamando A mi misma sepultura? Ne dethe, alas! ne wolle not my life; Thus walke I like a restlesse caytiffe, And on the grounde, which is my moder's gayte, I knocke with my staffe erlich and late, And sayn thus, âLeve moder, let me yn.â Chaucer's Pardoner's Tale. Guil. Nay, calm yourself, The population of the place is up After the criminal. Urr. And to what purpose? They cannot wipe away my shame by that. Let the whole city turn its myriad eyes Upon me, and behold a man disgrac'dâ Disgrac'd by him to whom he gave a being. I say, behold me allâthe wretched man By his own flesh and blood insulted, and On his own flesh and blood crying Revenge! Revenge! revenge! revenge! Not to the heavens only, nor to Him Who sits in judgment there, do I appeal, But to the powers of earth. Give me my hat, I'll to the king forthwith. Vic. Consider, sir; You would not enter in the palace gates So suddenly, and in this plight? Urr. Why not, Whose voice should over-leap the firmament, And without any preparation enter The palace-doors of Godâ King Pedro! king of Arragon! Christian king! Whom fools the Cruel call, and Just the wise, I call on you, King Pedro The Biographie Universelle says it was Don Pedro of Castile about whose cognomen there was some difference of opinion; a defence of him being written in 1648 by Count de Roca, ambassador from Spain to Venice, entitled, âEl Rey Don Pedro, llamado el Cruel, el Justiciero, y el Necessitado, defendido.â It is he, I suppose, figures in the âMedico de su Honra.â He flourished at the same time, however, with his namesake of Arragon.â King (entering with Mendo and Train). Who calls the king? Urr. A wretch who, falling at your feet, implores Your royal justice. King. I remember you; Don Lope de Urrea, whose son I pardon'd. What would you of me? Urr. That you would, my king, Unpardon him you pardon'd; draw on him The disappointed sword of justice down. That sonâmy sonâif he indeed be mineâ (Oh, Blanca, pure as the first blush of day, Pardon me such a word!) has, after all My pain and sacrifice in his behalf; Has, in defiance of the laws of man And God, and of that great commandment, which, Though fourth on the two tables, yet comes first After God's jealous honour is secur'd, Has struck meâstruck his fatherâin a fray Wherein that father tried to save his life. I have no vindication; will have none, But at your hands and by your laws; unless, If you deny me that, I do appeal Unto the King of kings to do me justice; Which I will have, that heav'n and earth may know How a bad son begets a ruthless sire! King. Mendo! Men. My liege. King. I must again refer This cause to you. (To Urrea.) Where is your son? Urr. Fled! fled! King (to Mendo). After him then, use all the powers I own To bring the wretch to justice. See me not Till that be done. Men. I'll do my best, my liege. King. I have it most at heart. In all the rolls Of history, I know of no like quarrel: And the first judgment on it shall be done By the Fourth Pedro, king of Arragon. [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. A Wild Place.âEnter Mendo and Officers of Justice armed. 1st Officer. Here, my lord, where the Ebro, swollen with her mountain streams, runs swiftest, he will try to escape. Men. Hunt for him then, leaving neither rock nor thicket unexplored. (They disperse.) Oh, what a fate is mine, Having to seek what most I dread to find, Once thought the curse of jealousy alone! The iron king will see my face no more Unless I bring Don Lope to his feet: Whom, on the other hand, the gratitude And love I bear him fain would save from justice. Oh, howâ Enter some, fighting with Don Lope. Lope. I know I cannot save my life, But I will sell it dear. Men. Hold off! the king Will have him taken, but not slain. And I, If I can save him now, shall find a mean To do it afterwardsâ Don Lope! Lope. I should know that voice, the face I cannot, blind with fury, dust, and blood. Or was't the echo of some inner voice, Some far off thunder of the memory, That moves me more than all these fellows' swords! Is it Don Mendo? Men. Who demands of you Your sword, and that you yield in the king's name. Lope. I yield? Men. Ay, sir, what can you do beside? Lope. Slaying be slain. And yet my heart relents Before your voice; and now I see your face My eyes dissolve in tears. Why, how is this? What charm is on my sword? Men. 'Tis but the effect And countenance of justice that inspires Involuntary awe in the offender. Lope. Not that. Delinquent as I am, I could, With no more awe of justice than a mad dog, Bite right and left among her officers; But 'tis yourself alone: to you alone Do I submit myself; yield up my sword Already running with your people's blood, And at your feetâ Men. Rise, Lope. Heaven knows How gladly would your judge change place with you The criminal; far happier to endure Your peril than my own anxiety. But do not you despair, however stern Tow'rds you I carry me before the world. The king is so enrag'dâ Lope. What, he has heard! Men. Your father cried for vengeance at his feet. Lope. Where is my sword? Men. In vain. 'Tis in my hand. Lope. Where somehow it affrights meâas before When giving you my dagger, it turn'd on me With my own blood. Mendo. Ho there! Cover Don Lope's face, and carry him To prison after me. (Aside). Hark, in your ear, Conduct him swiftly, and with all secrecy, To my own houseâin by the private door, Without his knowing whither, And bid my people watch and wait on him. I'll to the kingâ Alas, what agony, I know not what, grows on me more and more! [Exeunt. Scene II. A Room in the Palace.âEnter King. King. Don Mendo comes not back, and must not come, Till he have done his errand. I myself Can have no rest till justice have her due. A son to strike his father in my realm Unaw'd, and then unpunisht! But by great Heav'n the law shall be aveng'd So long as I shall reign in Arragon. Don Mendo! Enter Mendo. Mendo. Let me kiss your Highness' handâ King. Welcome, thou other Atlas of my realm, Who shar'st the weight with me. For I doubt not, Coming thus readily into my presence, You bring Don Lope with you. Men. Yes, my liegeâ Fast prisoner in my house, that none may see Or talk with him. King. Among your services You have not done a better. The crime is strange, 'tis fit the sentence on it Be memorably just. Men. Most true, my liege, Who I am sure will not be warp'd away By the side current of a first report, But on the whole broad stream of evidence Move to conclusion. I do know this charge Is not so grave as was at first reported. King. But is not thus much clearâthat a son smote His father? Men. Yes, my liege. King. And can a charge Be weightier? Men. I confess the naked fact, But 'tis the special cause and circumstance That give the special colour to the crime. King. I shall be glad to have my kingdom freed From the dishonour of so foul a deed By any extenuation. Men. Then I think Your Majesty shall find it here. 'Tis thus: Don Lope, on what ground I do not know, Fights with Don Guillenâin the midst o' the fray, Comes old Urrea, at the very point When Guillen was about to give the lie To his opponentâwhich the old man, enrag'd At such unseemly riot in his house, Gives for him; calls his son a fouler name Than gentleman can bear, and in the scuffle Receives a blow that in his son's blind rage Was aim'd abroadâin the first heat of passion Throws himself at your feet, and calls for vengeance, Which, as I hear, he now repents him of. He's old and testyâage's common faultâ And, were not this enough to lame swift justice, There's an old law in Arragon, my liege, That in our courts father and son shall not Be heard in evidence against each other; In which provision I would fain persuade you Bury this quarrel. King. And this seems just to you? Men. It does, my liege. King. Then not to me, Don Mendo, Who will examine, sentence, and record, Whether in such a scandal to the realm The son be guilty of impiety, Or the sire idle to accuse him of't. Therefore I charge you have Urrea too From home to-night, and guarded close alone; It much imports the business. Men. I will, my liege. [Exeunt severally. Scene III. A Corridor in Urrea's House, with three doors in front.âEnter from a side door Violante and Elvira. Viol. Ask me no more, Elvira; I cannot answer when my thoughts are all locked up where Lope lies. Elv. And know you where that is? Nearer than you think; there, in my lord your father's room. Viol. There! Oh, could I but save him! Elv. You can at least comfort him. Viol. Something must be done. Either I will save his life, Elvira, or die with him. Have you the key? Elv. I have one; my lord has the master-key. Viol. Yours will do, give it me. I am desperate, Elvira, and in his danger drown my maiden shame; see him I will at least. Do you rest here and give me a warning if a footstep come. (She enters centre door.) Scene IV. An inner Chamber in Urrea's House.âLope discovered. Lope. Whither then have they brought me? Ah, Violante, Your beauty costs me dear! And even now I count the little I have yet to live Minute by minute, like one last sweet draught, But for your sake. Nay, 'tis not life I care for, But only Violante. Violante (entering unseen). Oh, his face Is bathed in his own blood; he has been wounded. Don Lope! Lope. Who is it calls on a name I thought all tongues had buried in its shame? Viol. One who yetâpities you. Lope (turning and seeing her). Am I then dead, And thou some living spirit come to meet me Upon the threshold of another world; Or some dead image that my living brain Draws from remembrance on the viewless air, And gives the voice I love to? Oh, being here, Whatever thou may'st be, torment me not By vanishing at once. Viol. No spirit, Lope, And no delusive image of the brain; But one who, wretched in your wretchedness, And partner of the crime you suffer for, All risk of shame and danger cast away, Has comeâbut hark!âI may have but a momentâ The door I came by will be left unlockt To-night, and you must fly. Lope. Oh, I have heard Of a fair flower of such strange quality, It makes a wound where there was none before, And heals what wound there was. Oh, Violante, You who first made an unscath'd heart to bleed, Now save a desperate life! Viol. And I have heard Of two yet stranger flowers that, severally, Each in its heart a deadly poison holds, Which, if they join, turns to a sovereign balm. And so with us, who in our bosoms bear A passion which destroys us when apart, But when togetherâ Elvira (calling within). Madam! madam! your father! Viol. Farewell! Lope. But you return? Viol. To set you free. Lope. That as it may; only return to me. [Exit Violante, leaving Lope. Scene V. Same as Scene III. Elvira waiting.âEnter Violante from centre door. Viol. Quick! lock the door, Elvira, and away with me on wings. My father must not find me here. Elv. Nay, you need not be frightened, he has gone to my lady Blanca's room by the way. Viol. No matter, he must not find me; I would learn too what is stirring in the business. Oh, would I ever drag my purpose through, I must be desperate and cautious too. [Exit. Elv. (locking the door). Well, that's all safe, and now myself to hear what news is stirring. Vicente (talking as he enters). In the devil's name was there ever such a clutter made about a blow? People all up in arms, and running here and there, and up and down, and every where, as if the great Tom of Velilla was a ringing. Elv. Vicente! what's the matter? Vic. Oh, a very great matter, Elvira. I am very much put out indeed. Elv. What about, and with whom? Vic. With all the world, and my two masters, the young and old one, especially. Elv. But about what? Vic. With the young one for being so ready with his fists, and the old one bawling out upon it to heaven and earth, and then Madam Blanca, she must join in the chorus too; and then your grand Don Mendo there, with whom seizing's so much in season, he has seized my master, and my master's father, and Don Guillen, and clapt them all up in prison. Then I've a quarrel with the king! Elv. With the king! You must be drunk, Vicente. Vic. I only wish I was. Elv. But what has the king done? Vic. Why let me be beaten at least fifty thousand times, without caring a jot: and now forsooth because an old fellow gets a little push, his eyes flash axe and gibbet. Then, Elvira, I'm very angry with you. Elv. And why with me? Vic. Because, desperately in love with me as you are, you never serenade me, nor write me a billet-doux, nor ask me for a kiss of my fair hand. Elv. Have I not told you, sir, I leave that all to Beatrice? Vic. And have I not told you, Beatrice may go hang for me? Elv. Oh, Vicente, could I believe you! Vic. Come, give me a kiss on credit of it; in case I lie, I'll pay you back. Elv. Well, for this once. Enter Beatrice. Beat. The saints be praised, I've found you at last! Vic. Beatrice! Elv. Well, what's the matter? Vic. You'll soon see. Beat. Oh, pray proceed, proceed, good folks. Never mind me: you've businessâdon't interrupt itâI've seen quite enough, besides being quite indifferent who wears my castoff shoes. Elv. I beg to say, madam, I wear no shoes except my own, and if I were reduced to other people's certainly should not choose those that are made for a wooden leg. Beat. A wooden leg? Pray, madam, what has a wooden leg to do with me? Elv. Oh, madam, I must refer you to your own feelings. Beat. I tell you, madam, these hands should tear your hair up by the roots, if it had roots to tear. Vic. Now for her turn. Elv. Why, does she mean to insinuate my hair is as false as that left eye of hers? Beat. Do you mean to insinuate my left eye is false? Elv. Ay; and say it to your teeth. Beat. More, madam, than I ever could say to yours, unless, indeed, you've paid, madam, for the set you wear. Elv. Have you the face to say my teeth are false? Beat. Have you the face to say my eye's of glass? Elv. I'll teach you to say I wear a wig. Beat. Would that my leg were wood just for the occasion. Vic. Ladies, ladies, first consider where we are. Beat. Oh ho! I think I begin to understand. Elv. Oh, and so methinks do I. (Spoken together ... ) Beat. It is this wretchâ Elv. This knaveâ Beat. This rascalâ Elv. This vagabondâ Beat. Has told all these lies. Elv. Has done all this mischief. ( ... Spoken together.) (They set upon and pinch him, &amp;c.) Vic. Ladies, ladiesâMercy! oh! ladies! just listen! Elv. Listen indeed! If it were not that I hear people comingâ Vic. Heaven be praised for it! Beat. We will defer the execution thenâAnd in the mean while shall we two sign a treaty of peace? Elv. My hand to itâAgreed! Beat. Adieu! Elv. Adieu! [Exeunt Beatrice and Elvira. Vic. The devil that seiz'd the swine sure has seiz'd you, And all your pinches make me tenfold writhe Because you never gave the king his tithe. [Exit. Scene VI. Donna Blanca's Apartment: it is dark.âEnter the King disguised, and Blanca following him. Blan. Who is this man, That in the gathering dusk enters our house, Unmaskt and muffled thus? what is't you want? To croak new evil in my ears? for none But ravens now come near usâSuch a silence Is not the less ill-omen'd. Beatrice! A light! my blood runs coldâAnswer me, man, What want you with me? King. Let us be alone, And I will tell you. Blan. Leave us, Beatriceâ I'll dare the worstâAnd now reveal yourself. King. Not till the door be lockt. Blan. Help, help! King. Be still. Blan. What would you? and who are you then? King (discovering himself). The king. Blan. The king! King. Do you not know me? Blan. Yea, my liege, Now the black cloud has fallen from the sun. But cannot guess why, at an hour like this, And thus disguis'dâOh, let me know at once Whether in mercy or new wrath you come To this most wretched house! King. In neither, Blanca; But in the execution of the trust That Heav'n has given to kings. Blan. And how, my liege, Fall I beneath your royal vigilance? King. You soon shall hear: but, Blanca, first take breath, And still your heart to its accustom'd tune, For I must have you all yourself to answer What I must ask of you. Listen to me. Your son, in the full eye of God and man, Has struck his fatherâwho as publicly Has cried to me for vengeanceâsuch a feud Coming at length to such unnatural close, Men 'gin to turn suspicious eyes on you,â You, Blanca, so mixt up in such a cause As in the annals of all human crime Is not recorded. Men begin to ask Can these indeed be truly son and sire? This is the question, and to sift it home, I am myself come hither to sift you By my own mouth. Open your heart to me, Relying on the honour of a king That nothing you reveal to me to-night Shall ever turn against your good repute. We are alone, none to way-lay the words That travel from your lips; speak out at once; Or, by the heavens, Blanca,â Blan. Oh, my liege, Not in one breath Turn royal mercy into needless threat; Though it be true my bosom has so long This secret kept close prisoner, and hop'd To have it buried with me in my grave, Yet if I peril my own name and theirs By such a silence, I'll not leave to rumour Another hour's suspicion; but reveal To you, my liege, yea, and to heav'n and earth, My most disastrous story. King. I attend. Blan. My father, though of lineage high and clear As the sun's self, was poor; and knowing well How in this world honour fares ill alone, Betroth'd the beauty of my earliest years (The only dowry that I brought with me) To Lope de Urrea, whose estate Was to supply the much he miss'd of youth. We marriedâlike December wed to May, Or flower of earliest summer set in snow; Yet heaven witness that I honour'd, ay, And lov'd him; though with little cause of love, And ever cold returns; but I went on Doing my duty toward him, hoping still To have a son to fill the gaping void That lay between usâyea, I pray'd for one So earnestly, that God, who has ordain'd That we should ask at once for all and nothing Of Him who best knows what is best for us, Denied me what I wrongly coveted. Well, let me turn the leaf on which are written The troubles of those ill-assorted years, And to my tale. I had a younger sister, Whom to console me in my wretched home, I took to live with meâof whose fair youth A gentleman enamour'dâOh, my liege, Ask not his nameâyet why should I conceal it, Whose honour may not leave a single chink For doubt to nestle in? Sir, 'twas Don Mendo, Your minister; who, when his idle suit Prosper'd not in my sister's ear, found means, Feeing one of the household to his purpose, To get admittance to her room by night; Where, swearing marriage soon should sanction love, He went away the victor of an honour That like a villain he had come to steal; Then, but a few weeks after, (so men quit All obligation save of their desire,) Married another, and growing great at court, Went on your father's bidding into France Ambassador, and from that hour to this Knows not the tragic issue of his crime. I, who perceiv'd my sister's alter'd looks, And how in mind and body she far'd ill, With menace and persuasion wrung from her The secret I have told you, and of which She bore within her bosom such a witness As doubly prey'd upon her life. Enough; She was my sister, why reproach her then, And to no purpose now the deed was done? Only I wonder'd at mysterious Heav'n, Which her misfortune made to double mine, Who had been pining for the very boon That was her shame and sorrow; till at last, Out of the tangle of this double grief I drew a thread to extricate us both, By giving forth myself about to bear The child whose birth my sister should conceal. 'Twas doneâthe day came onâI feign'd the pain She felt, and on my bosom as my own Cherish'd the crying infant she had borne, And died in bearingâfor even so it was; I and another matron (who alone Was partner in the plot) Assigning other illness for her death. This is my story, sirâthis is the crime, Of which the guilt being wholly mine, be mine The punishment; I pleading on my knees My love both to my husband and my sister As some excuse. Pedro of Arragon, Whom people call the Just, be just to me: I do not ask for mercy, but for justice, And that, whatever be my punishment, It may be told of me, and put on record, That, howsoever and with what design I might deceive my husband and the world, At least I have not sham'd my birth and honour. King (apart). Thus much at least is well; the blackest part Of this unnatural feud is washt away By this confession, though it swell the list Of knotted doubts that Justice must resolve; As thus:âDon Lope has revil'd and struck One whom himself and all the world believe His fatherâa believe that I am pledg'd Not to disprove. Don Mendo has traduc'd A noble lady to her death; and Blanca Contriv'd an ill imposture on her lord: Two secret and one public misdemeanour, To which I must adjudge due punishment. Blanca, enough at present, you have done Your duty; Fare you well. Blan. Heav'n keep your Highness! Don Mendo (knocking within). Open the door. King. Who calls? Blan. I know not, sir. King. Open it, then, but on your life reveal not That I am here. (King hides, Blanca opens the door.) Blan. Who is it calls? Enter Mendo. Men. I, Blanca. Blan. Your errand? Men. Only, Blanca, to beseech you Fear not, whatever you may hear or see Against your son. His cause is in my hands, His person in my keeping; being so, Who shall arraign my dealings with him? King. (coming forth). I. Men. My liege, if youâ King. Enough; give me the key Of Lope's prison. Men. This it is, my liege, Onlyâ King. I know enough. Blanca, retire. Mendo, abide you here. To-night shall show If I be worthy of my name or no. [Exit. Men. What is the matter, Blanca? Blan. Your misdeeds, And mine, Don Mendo, which just Heaven now Revenges with one blow on both of us. After the King! nor leave him till he swear To spare my Lope, who, I swear to you, Is not my son, but yours, and my poor Laura's! Men. Merciful Heav'ns! But I will save his life Come what come may to me. Blan. Away, away, then! [Exeunt severally. Scene VII. Same as Scene III.âEnter Violante and Elvira at a side door. Elv. Consider, madam. Viol. No! Elv. But thinkâ Viol. I tell you it must be done. Elv. They will accuse your father. Viol. Let them; I tell you it must be done, and now: I ask'd you not for advice, but to obey me. Unlock the door. Elv. Oh how I tremble! Hark! Viol. A moment! They must not find him passing outâ the attempt and not the deed confounding us. Y se queda su intencion Sin su efecto discubierta. Listen! Elv. (listening at a side door). I can hear nothing distinct, only a confused murmur of voices. Viol. Let meâhush!âHark! they are approaching! Enter Mendo. Men. Anguish, oh! anguish! Viol. My father! Men. Ay, indeed, And a most wretched one. Viol. What is it, sir? Tell me at once. Men. I know not. Oh, 'tis false! I know too well, and you must know it too. My daughter, the poor prisoner who lies there Is my own son, not Blanca's, not Urrea's, But my own son, your brother, Violante! Viol. My brother! Men. Ay, your brother, my own son, Whom we must save! Viol. Alas, sir, I was here On the same errand, ere I knewâbut hark! All's quiet now. (A groan within.) Men. Listen! What groan was that? Viol. My hand shakes so, I cannotâ Lope (within). Mercy, O God! Men. The key, the key!âbut hark! they call again At either door; we must unlock. (They unlock the side doors.âEnter through one Blanca and Beatrice, through the other Urrea and Vicente.) Urr. Don Mendo, The king desires me from your mouth to learn His sentence on my son. Blan. Oh, Violante! Men. From me! from me! to whom the king as yet Has not deliver'd it.â But what is this? Oh, God! (The centre door opens and Don Lope is discovered, garrotted, with a paper in his hand, and lights at each side.) Urr. A sight to turn Rancour into remorse. Men. In his cold hand He holds a scroll, the sentence, it may be, The king referr'd you to. Read it, Urrea; I cannot. Oh, my son, the chastisement That I alone have merited has come Upon us both, and doubled the remorse That I must feelâand stifle! Urr. (reading). âHe that reviles and strikes whom he believes His father, let him die for't; and let those Who have disgrac'd a noble name, or join'd An ill imposture, see his doom; and show Three judgments summ'd up in a single blow.</field>
