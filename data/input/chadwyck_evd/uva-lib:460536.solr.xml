      <field name="fulltext">Scene A Woodland by a tidal river in the West of England.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Artemis Dictynna enters with her Nymphs. The silver tide, fretted by summer leaves, Sails past the woodlands, ebbing to the sea: But soon the joyous current will return To the last bridge that sucks the ocean-flow; Soon will the morning swell to noontide, sooner Than ocean reach the freshets. Time and waves And light are moving, yet my sylvan bands Delay their muster and delay their flight After the prey that flies. Cold sisterhood, Whose vows are mine, rouse up the hern and rook With bugle-blast that scales the thin-leaved elms, Those dainty wands engarlanded and high Above our Cornish haunt: rouse up the laggard Among you that are absent, for today I would not have you idle. You must stablish Our right to hunt the forest as of yore, Since now a stranger owns it, one who bought The country-side as mortals buy, unmindful Of anything beyond its roodsâa lady Who, though a virgin and beside that grace Heart-free, inclines in no wise to my worshipâ As Christian maids among these holy vales Where Convents hide their loneliness, incline, Harming my candid ritual with threnes Worthy of Hades and of Charon's ear. She has, I know by that which in my bosom Is the great virgin art of prophecy, A nature adverse to solemnities That are to her as praise of barrenness, Or summer-time denied. So we must prove Our freedom to the mystic ownership Of her new forest-acres. Sound your call, And bid your sister-huntresses approach. Chorus of Nymphs Hither, fellows of the chase, Hither with the dry, bent bow, Hither with the buskin, hither With the chiton to the knee And inviolable zone, With the fillet at the temples, Breast untamed, and crystal voice Ringing through the forest-brakes, Ringing through the western breezes, Mingled with the horn that echoes And the pressure of the streams. Come to prove your maiden zest, Prove your own pure liberty, Ye whose spirits have no lord, Ye whose every sense is chill With the freshness of its birth; Ye secure from any feeling That can visit as a doom; Ye who live and hunt as men, Ye who do not burn as theyâ Women in your pride and yet Never is the glory yielded; Ye who share with mortals solely What is yokeless in their state, Sovereign each within yourselves! More Nymphs enter Artemis They come; the boughs are tossing as with wind, The spears and hazel-withies intermingle, Rooks screech, the herons trail along the sky, And all the copse is glad and terrifiedâ The mood it takes when hunt-ups challenge it. All armed and ready? Nay, LysithoÃ« Is missing from the troop, LysithoÃ« My sturdiest nymph, best trainer of my dogs, Crowning herself and them with oaken sprays When she has made wide ravage. We must leave My doughty vagrant to her solitude, For the day warms, and through the glade a herd Of youthful Satyrs range. We will begone Before their laughter prick us to desire They wholly were what half they areâsuch beasts As we might slay unchallenged: and yet more To urge us to remove I see a boat Push up against the tide and toward this creek, Rowed by a woman, our fair enemy; And, by Adonis' footprints, she must hear Beyond her sanction our halloos ring out. Artemis and her Nymphs retire, while Satyrs enter dancing from the other side. Satyrs Frolic, frolic! 'Tis the May; Let us keep our holiday In this orchard old and gray We have won by wanton thieving. On a summer night we stole Secret for the summer apples, Creeping past the beech's bole. Not a mortal there to curse us! How each Satyr tossed his thyrsus, Tossing too the golden apples High among the hoary moss, Where the woodland sunshine dapples; And the cotter this perceiving, On his ladder where he stood, Left his pot of summer apples, Left the sunshine where it dapples, Fled for ever from the wood. Frolic, frolic! There is story That the gods forbade to eat Of the appleâtherefore munch it, And with teeth nut-sharpened crunch it, As the rabbit eats the henbane, Let us browse upon the boughs Of the scarlet apples sweetâ That is in the autumn: now Patient till the trees are laden, We from thievish lust refrain. We are here to smell the blossoms In among the lichens hoary; Through the rankness of the grass To make passage, through the bluebells Path for Satyr's hoofs to pass. We are here to catch the maiden, Tripping down the leafy lane, And to fright her from her senses With our arms about her waist. Satyrs, haste To the farmyard, to the dingle, To the shed at milking-time; We with pretty maids will mingle; For it is the sweet May-prime. Philampelos [making a dash into the thicket, and leading out Cherry] Found! Hylichore The fortune! Cherry's self! Cherry is the dainty elf Skims the cream &amp; tends the cow: Cherry does not keep aloof, Has no fear of shag or hoof; She will grace our danceâA round! They dance: Cherry disappears. Drymon Sudden she has slipped away. Philampelos Ah, a boat is in the bay. Hylichore 'Tis the lady Genifer Come in wrath to look for her. But we will not lose our sport ... Through the osmund-fern a snort! Lo, we unwrap him, crouching from the heat. Dryaspis, make the dancers' ring complete. [Dryaspis rising makes no response.] Bacchus, he scowls, and mark his surly lip. Dryaspis I own no more your gamesome fellowship. Drymon Why from the gossmoor have you kept aloof? Philampelos How is it that you go with dragging hoof? Hylichore And never toss the thyrsus? comrade, sayâ Too human are you grown for forest-play? Dryaspis For anything but death The mortal's certain end! I breathe another's breath, Go where her footsteps wend; I see alone her eyes, And lose all other sight: As wind about the skies My body feels her flight; And in my heart a fire Is the sole life I own, Yet that is but desire For her who leaves me lone. Drymon Is she god-born who hath this passion wrought? Dryaspis She makes me weak &amp; aged in every thought. Philampelos How like the winter! From such love defend us! Dryaspis Hear them, great Pan! Hylichore For it would surely end us. Drymon But hearken, Hylichoreâmortal feet! Philampelos Behind this briony I'll find retreat. Drymon I to the oaks! Dryaspis And I to wander on, LysithoÃ«, wherever thou art gone. The Satyrs run out diversely as Genifer enters. Genifer Hail my sweet forest! I have left the stream That all can traverse for this blessÃ¨d shade That is my own and lays upon my heart A weight of pleasure, as its branching tiers Crowd down on vision. And the bluebells! Noon Is wooing all the azure out of them; They deepen, and the shadow of a dove Passes across. But oh, this apple-tree, Amid the mossy and decaying trees!â The bees enjoy, profound in every motion, In every hum, and petal after petal Steals down the air. Is it the deep-withdrawn And underswelling chorus of the bees, Absorbed in their response to the appeal Of all its whites and roses and ripe stains And tremulous shadows, petal after petal Stealing adown the air, that is too rich And forces me to tears? I cannot tell! I sigh for joy, and yet I feel a secret, A portent, something hidden reaches me Without confession, and I stand alone. Ah, what in woman's life should be portentous, What but the coming of that miracle Those who have felt call love? I do not know it, Yet all the balm and light of summer time Seems woven one with hope. This little skiff That followed me a speck so far away, Has followed to this reach, and if I bend The tassels of the oak aside I catch Glimpse of an oarsman nearing rapidly: And he is youngâhe gives me but the glint Of lips, a charming sun-frown and a drift Of tendrils on the brow. Oh, in myself I take for ever as a memory, And one that will not lie at rest, those lips. Ervan enters Ervan LysithoÃ«! Genifer My name is Genifer. Ervan Then help me; you are surely known to her. Genifer Where have you seen this lady of delight? Ervan Where! Oh, where is she not? In orchard white, 'Mid daisies and the fallen apple-flowers; And I have watched her unespied, for hours Dipping in freshet or by plantain stream, Under the cooling sycamore from beam Of the hot sun shading her lovely limbs; Or caught her on the current as she swims Fearless from leafy river to the sea. Where is there haunt of hers unknown to me? But I have angered her, and swift as tides Course o'er the covered sands from me she hides. You have her secret; say where she abides! Genifer Could I but aid you! Hard to understand Your quest ... I am the lady of this land, Of these green forest-shores, of every creature Within their realm. So delicate of featureâ Give me her eyes, the colour of her hair. Ervan Brown as the streams, her streams. Oh, I despairâ So healthful and so regnant in her health, A huntress and an Amazon! Your wealth You dream ordains you lady of this landâ She has its wolves and wild-deer at command; She cherishes the eaglet from its nest Rocked by the storm, the leveret loves her breast; Tho' fierce in slaughter, yet the softest broods Of April are not softer than her moods Of piety and ruth; but never yet On mortal has her gentleness been set. If, as you boast, you own this holy shade, You know the powers by whom you are obeyed. Genifer The forest-land is tenantless. Ervan Ah no! How blind and deaf! I swear it is not so. Have you not seen the revellers of Spring, The fauns and satyrs, at their junketing? Have you not heard their half-blown horns grow still Shamed by your presence? On the rock-towered hill Have you not heard the huntresses awake An echo that your voice could never shake Or woo to service with your merchant-gold? Oh, you are wrapped in dulness manifold; You cannot help me. Genifer Sir, what I have heard, Whether from voice of tree or haunting bird Or rivulet, is loved as if my heart Went with the sound and with the sound took part: What I have seen is mine as if by gift, And given, its sweetness has for me no rift. A faun or huntress I have never seen, But had I known them, friends we should have been. Ervan This is the place! 'Twas thus the hawthorn drooped Above the water, while my lady stooped Between the blossoms and the river-brinkâ Genifer The tide was low, for now the hawthorns drink; One may smell their blossoms. Ervan Gone the grace, For ever gone the genius of the place ... And the dull flowers monotonously bloom! Genifer To me these coverts have no trace of gloom. The sunshine banks are soft and coy; I find The creek, this moment, wholly to my mind. All, all is here I could desire to be, Morning and springtide's fluttered light, the sea, That ardent stranger on its way to me, Soon to be wholly mine. Beneath yon bridge How the brine presses through the weedy ridge And takes the orchard shadows to its gleam. You do not mark the current. Ervan Ah, you dream Of that which is. Genifer I have no memory To spoil the instant. Ervan You are passion-free? O lady of the eyes one must not praise, So steadfast is their sky, such summer-days They promise their belovedâyou do not know The perilous sweets of love? Genifer I pray you, go! There is a bugle in my woods, the maid You love may be at hand. Ervan You are obeyed. But yet I heard no note. LysithoÃ«, How of a sudden you inform these shades With infinite, quick life! [exit Genifer What loneliness Is on the hillside! When I am removed From these my groves, my streams, from Mellynheil, And from the sweet, low stream Trevederas, I see them thus, continuous in their waving, Continuous in their flow; but desolate As the dark woods of Chaos with no song From branch or bubbling fount. So seems it now; For I am emptied of my place, left out, My ownership disproved. I cannot see The nymphs at revel; if there is enchantment Under the elder-copse, beyond its dense And ravishing white honey, as too gross I am excluded from the spell: if spirits Call to the hills and catch their speech again, As in a mirror one receives one's face, Then it is true I have no earsâand yet While he was questioning I heard a note As from a half-blown horn. So much is come And coming up the stream to me: already The birds sing deeper, and fresh scent is blown Across me tho' the honeysuckle's sealed Tight in its handful buds. But I must weep To be so ignorantâhow he o'erthrew me And showed me what I am! I have no power, The earth is locked away from me, except ... Unless ... O blessedness, I hear an echo From hidden voices, hear the baying hounds He loves the bay of: haply in their train The satyrs follow. This dear wood becomes The seat of many solemn mysteries. Purge me, O Love, to vision. Who is this? A Voice is heard. Neon, Tyras, hasten, leave the rocks! Leave the spiky ruscus and the broom, Turn and leave the fleeing beast to flee. We will ease our limbs upon the moss; We will watch the ocean sap the woodlands, Or ye both shall nestle to my bosom, Ye shall sleep and I will dream awake. Lysithoe breaks through the underwood. In this spot, half-orchard, half the forest, We will rest until the heat grows gray; Till the breezes reach us with their fountains. Sleep!âforget the chase, while I remember, I who have the power that savours joy When the joy has sunk into my blood; And evoke it, pondering my captures, All my ravage, all your faithful prowess. Neon, Tyras, from the rocks descend! She couches herself at a distance with her dogs. Genifer How mere a woman's comeliness, no nymph! As fisher-girl fresh from the tide, she plucks Her camise from her bosom and flings down On my rock-seat dishevelled. How her dogs Fondle about her as she curbs their strife! If this should be LysithoÃ«! She dreams Of what?âher troop of sylvan huntresses, Of triumphs in the woods, of the barbed spear Held by a tingling hand, the sudden onslaught, Grapple, and gory hide. 'Tis to her dogs She breathes her day-dreams, and her subtle gestures Give them the chase afresh! But while she muses On baffled prey or cruel snare to spread, Her Knight, one urging torment in his bosom, Calls on her name. (advancing) LysithoÃ«âfor so, If I interpret true, you call yourself ... But first, I do not err? LysithoÃ« How timidly You put your question! Nymph of Artemis, Freebooter in the woods of late withdrawn From our wide ranges: more to trouble you, So your mild carriage tempts me to extremes, In wanton moments, truant from my Queen, Consort in revel to the gamester Pan, Whose noontide sleep I vex with hazel-wands Till with a roar he wakes. LysithoÃ« Is certainly my name. Genifer Then you are sought And cried for through the forest; one who loves you Has passed this way. LysithoÃ« The fool! Genifer To me his sorrow Is as the saddest thing my wonder yet Has found in life. Think for a little whileâ And make the dogs lie downâhow in yourself You have a power to heal this misery, Curing at once the madness and despair So piteously mingled. O believe me, Lady, it is not that you touch a spear Like Artemis, it is because your feet As hers are finely arched, because your bosom Is open to the shadow of the leaves And streaking sunshine that you are pursued So hotly down the forest. By your beauty Alone you can be cruel: be content, For I have seen one suffer for your sake Even to the mortal limit. LysithoÃ« I am senseless, Rock at the heart, and cannot waste my time Trifling with love! Genifer What are your joys, your pains? LysithoÃ« Those that befall myselfâmy pleasure Is a freedom vast and uncontrolled, Safe from bond of human sympathy, Safe from yearning as the Earth is safe. You can never live with secret nature, For the noise of love's remorseless claim Beats between your senses and her stealth; You can never compass her great passions. While for me, my ears are but the echo Of her breezes, of her flashing sounds, Stir of instant will or soft suspense. I can reach to wonders that have dwelling Far beyond the cock-crow, or the chorus Of the birds before they sleep at eve. I have followed your own iris-river Where its earliest reed-beds quiver, Where it fills the ditches under willows, Dark as any pool, to where it spreads In a marsh of marigold, sweet gale, Crumpled cressy beds, or seems to fail, Then sudden reappears, sweet Mellynheil, Sculpturing the sands on the lone beach Between the sullen headlands, till it reach The foam profuse of the high-moulded billows. Would you learn to meditate You must be content to wait Empty-hearted on a great, vague shore, Wind and sunshine pass before; Would you dream, or would you wonder At the heavens we live under, At man's life so quickly runâ When a storm beats on the rocks, High above the ocean-thunder, Let your eye rove where in flocks Sea-birds fly across the sun. Genifer I cannot bear the beauty: when a storm Beats on the stormy headland of Trevorse, My heart is with the fisher-folk, the peril Keeps me in awe: the environs of death Are as a holy ground, and Death himself A King that touches all with majesty On his great progress. Our poor cottagers Receive him simply and are blessed. Lelant Even now is mourning for her distant dead, Brought to her feet so close by the mere wash Of waves upon the sand. LysithoÃ«, There is behind the storm, within the rose A mystery that I behold and weep. LysithoÃ« The sun is waning; it is idle longer To think of noontide sleep. I came to rest, And found myself a trespasser, forbidden The unmolested silence of your woods. Ho, Neon, Tyras, I will seek the shelter Of the deep ilex-gullies in the cliffs, Till the hard light grows limpid for the eve. Genifer You shall not quit these precinctsâOh, abide! Here you are sought, here loved, the echoes here Answer your name: for me, I fly your lips. [exit. LysithoÃ« Then, Tyras, we will slumber. How yon owl To cool himself fans with his golden plumes Above the streaming willows. Pan himself Is scarcely safer buried in his grot Than I in this light play of leaves. What colours Burn through my closing eyelids, what a sense Of gold and lulling feathers in the air; What buzz of insects far away: I sleep. Dryaspis [crawling from under a yew] O lady, O my sun that slays, In grace achieve my death; Have courage of thy cruel gaze, Smite with thy cruel breath: The grandeur of no mercy, queen, Give as thy satyr's meed; And let him die as he hath seen The great sun quench a weed. LysithoÃ« Hence to thy herd, and leave me to my rest. Dryaspis You of the haughty eye and naked breast, You do not know ... ah, will you ever know The utter loneliness, the wandering woe Of those that love till day and night are pain, Consumed by smart that never may attain, And by an image bolder than their nerve, Constrained to worship, yet as bondmen serve. You do not know how youth can fail With passion, and no friend avail; How Spring becomes a fell disease, And nothing flowered or green can please. A terror at myself has filled My limbs and to my centre thrilled. Oh, hear my gentleness appeal! My hours are severed from their wealâ No more my feet can dance, No more the pipe is blown, No more in noontide trance, On couch of whortle thrown, I snore, yet hear my sleep, And close my lids, yet see In midst of languor deep The red light muffle me. I leave the owl unchased, Nor eat the seed of cones; My limbs, by health once braced, Have withered into bones; I cannot call my goats, My breath is such a sigh: The birds with vernal throats Give to my heart their cry, While I beneath them stray, And care not if the briar Rend my long fleece away; Care not for dust or mire, For leaping rain or sunâ Things that were bright are strange, The loathed no more I shun; They pass beyond all range Of any thought or choice: I have no world but you. No climate but your voice, No stroke but your adieu. LysithoÃ« Receive it on the instant and farewell ... So may I never see you in this dell. Die, and attest what none has ever shown, That love is mortal and no passing moan. My dogs shall hunt you from my presence. Dryaspis Then You summon help that is your doom with men. LysithoÃ« Neon and Tyras, seize him! Dryaspis Set them on! My club is heavy. There! One foe is gone; The other ... ah, his teeth! ... I am a beast As well as he, but, Neon, not your feast! Stunned like your fellow-brute! [to LysithoÃ«] And now no steel Can save you, huntress, and no pert appeal. Mine are youâ LysithoÃ« Dian! sisters! Help, O Pan, Help, whosoever from this fastness can! Dryaspis I will not go unsatisfiedâa rage Wakes in my blood no censure can assuage, And only joy extinguish. You are mine, Your terror and abasement thrill like wine. Shriek on! I have my minute born of fire, And it shall die of its complete desire. LysithoÃ« Help, help! O shame! Ervan springs down the brake. Ervan She needs me. Loose her dress, You vile abuser of her loveliness; Down to the earth and crash against the rocks, You who have dared to handle her gold locks. [to LysithoÃ«] Bliss! you needed me and I was near, Bliss beyond the bliss that lovers weaveâ Though I grasp it, all my soul is drear With misgiving lest my pride deceive. Now you pant, as glorious as when dawn Flashes into light and heat and day, Through your veil in many flitters torn. Radiant presence, urge me not away! LysithoÃ« Neon is murdered. Ervan Your betrayer slain. LysithoÃ« Am I beloved of my great queen in vain? O Artemis, O Hecate, dear Titan Whose rule is ever honoured, child of hell, Infernal sorceress, who sit'st by tombs, And let'st the murdered dead make plaint to thee, Giving to pestilential winds their warrant To rave, to nightly dews to drop as bloodâ Hear me: my life is torn across. This hound, My nurseling, has been with me through the moods Of many years; we have been glad together, And he has never once been sorrowful Except when I was hurt: by all the forces Thou keep'st in leash to loose on infamous, Obscure and unregarded crime, avenge This creature's death! There is no other bond Like this deep, silent knitting with his kind; No other wound that pierces in this sort. O Hecate! Ervan That fondnessâdole and crying Are lavished on her hound that lies a-dying ... In this daze of hate I cannot woo, I can only ravish and undo: But that cry, that fondness! I am mute; Give me what you gave that senseless brute, Pour on me that voice if you would move, Pour that godlike lavishness of love. You are mad th'affection to deny Made the long, unsorrowed years slip by As a dream to those that loved of old. You are mad, with grief so uncontrolled Fatal blow of a rough hand to rue, Pouring your hot wrath on him that slew, Yonder churl, your ravisher. LysithoÃ« And youâ Clenched in your hand why do you hold my veil? Ervan As a man, your lord, I would prevail. If the cry within me could be told, You are all my blood has power to hold; In your beauty, in your arms my youth Fain would merge as its completing truth. All my flesh is mad for youârefuse! And the curse you strike me with subdues Speech and hope and faculty and name; All I was swells up in me as blame, All I am burns an unguarded flame. Anguish! And I need you with each sense, Gaze and touch and hearing so intense Spirits when they shudder in God's sight Scarce can know excess as infinite. Lysithoe lifts her arms to heaven. Ah, you so would arm yourself. I feel Prayer upon your lipsâto me appeal; The god in me alone can save you Th'exasperated lusts that brave you, That cry out for your blood. LysithoÃ« O Artemis, Kindle the mortal hatred, let me fall A sacrifice to thee, as the lone stranger Fallen on a hostile coast, or gather me Safe into flower or stream. I have no fear, So that thou keep me holy for thy use, A maiden, unpolluted. Let me die And hide me deeper in thy mountain caves, In the blue darkness where the light is bred; And in a silence as of drifted snow Let me receive thy piercing benison. O Artemis, as thou didst half recover A maiden, Hades-lost, be pitiful; I love thee, guard in me thy attributes, Guard thou thy godhead. Ervan Dumb the stone; Idol for man's breakingâI alone, Mortal folly that you cannot see, I alone can save you: give to me But an instant's worship with your face, Let me feel its influencing graceâ Music of your being on its way Singing its own dreams, and I obey Every movement of its instinct clear: You are safe as if with veil and spear. So you can overcome. LysithoÃ« O Light, O Star, O secret Heaven folded in thyself, Hear not the blasphemy; but since this mortal Speaks of pure love, O guardian of the mountains, In name of thy Endymion, I appealâ Guard me for sake of him whom thou didst love As in a vision, whom thou didst behold, And infinitely lingerâvirgin love So penetrates its bliss. Goddess, this man Deems he can look into our mysteries, Who spurns not Aphrodite. Let thy dews, Thy deserts, the frore glitter of thy nights Arm me and shield. [enter Artemis. The veil drops from his hand; Mother, thou fold'st thine round me; not in flight We leave him; but with liberal, free steps. Thou hast thy Nymph, LysithoÃ«â Artemis My child! [exeunt. Ervan What pressure in the air, what influence As if of angered stars, and then a music Sweet as Hesperia's apple-guarding song, Remote, and travelling as if to islands Hidden beyond the verge ... [turning back to Dryaspis] Her conjured hate Stifles my bosom. [Dryaspis stirs.] Then you are not dead! Dryaspis Where is LysithoÃ«? If you have slain her, I can turn back to sleep. Ervan [flinging LysithoÃ«'s veil over Dryaspis] There! cover you! For I myself will bring you back this spear Dyed in her blood. LysithoÃ« is slain. LysithoÃ« shall not vex us. You may sleep. [exit. Dryaspis I would run Away, away ... not after her ... away! For the sun Shines on the ground too silent for the day: I would run; it is too great to stayâ But a weight is on my limbs; How the forest rocks and swims, And how open every sound Through the branches, from the ground. I must follow, I must hear Every bubble of the springs Fresh below the choking salt; Hear continuous sway of wings, If they pass or if they halt. Oh, to hear no moreâto lose all sight, Feel no pang that gnaws, no still fright! But my breath is bubbling like the springs That uplift the tide: All my body pulses as if wings Strove in my sideâ Then I sigh ... But the bubbling breath, the flesh that beats! Something presses close and then retreats. Oh, to die! Bitter, bitterer than pain, Sharper than unkindness: stream and forest wane, While more close the woe Presses inward, seems to growâ That Dryaspis should be slain, That so fond a thing as he, Faithful, lusty, yet should be Stained with his own blood and lying Underneath his oak-leaves dying. Philampelos comes from the wood. Philampelos Satyrs, run from dripping rill, From the holt and from the hill, From the ivy's long cascade Over rock and wall and roots, From the beeches' green-grass shade And the ring of elder-shoots ... For Dryaspis I have found Looking strange upon the ground, Crying like an owl, then still ... Drymon, Hylicmore and other Satyrs run in. Satyrs All together let us go And discover what his woe: All togetherâonly so! Drymon Dare you question, dare you come? If I look it strikes me dumb; I must cover up my eyes. Hylichore I will ask him why he cries, For he cannot hurt us. See! Round his forehead booms a bee, Booming Yes or No or Yes? With unshaken easefulness. Let us to our guest repair, Run along and cease to stare ... Stop! we will not go too close, For Dryaspis looks morose. Tell us, moon-calf creature, tell What has chanced or is not well? Drymon My very heart turns and I will not stay. Philampelos Ah, the truant he would play! Hylichore, hold him firm! He forsooth to pull and squirm! Drag him closeâDryaspis speaks: No, no, he whistles; and how pale his cheeks. Hylichore I hear a wordâ Drymon Softly! He fights for breath. Hylichore Listen! I caught the sound and it was death. Philampelos Oh, then draw back, dear playmates, and no longer Importune: Chiron says that death is stronger Than anything we see or touch or hear; He says it makes a world beneath us drear, And is the icy winter of our year, The ruin of our bowers and every leaf. We must not come too close to such a grief Now it has touched Dryaspisâno, we may not; Hence, and if coldness fall upon you, stay not! Hylichore Let us sit upon the rim Of the wood and keep our faith with him; For he is a Satyr and 'tis due To his forest-race we should be true: Yet if any breast should grow too chill We can fly among the brakes from ill. Drymon I can never sit so grave and still! Here are summer apples; with our feet Kick the little balls that are not sweet, Kick them through the grassâ So the time will pass. Hylichore All the birds are busy at their food, At their love or play; We are nothing to them in the mood We must keep to-day, Nothing more than roots or stones upstanding. Drymon See that golden mother-squirrel landing Six bright young ones from the streamâ How their eyes look out and round and gleam! If Dryaspis had not spoken, If our vigil could be broken, With the squirrel we would be In an instant up the tree. Oh, 'tis solemn still to die! I must fly! Philampelos Hush! There is no time for flight: For the lady from whose sight We have hidden is returning Swift as if her steps were burning: Yet she cannot have more wit Than the squirrel or the bird; Therefore sit Motionless, without a word. [enter Genifer. Genifer Sweet inlet, Dear beach of fern and sea-weed where he trod, Though there are other footprints, I must come To trace his footprints; if I can, recover His voice, not as he raised it to the hills, But softened to the wood-dove in its note Of wonder and appeal. I live for him, And since he flees me I must take possession, Fast as he quits it, of each vacant place. Ah me, will he return? This sycamine He set his tawny head against, these bushes He shredded so impatiently, this mirror That I looked down into, and learnt how black The lustre of his sorrowful, gray eyes! I saw him for an instant up the rocks Still in pursuit, I sawâ [perceiving Satyrs] But what is this? My glade is peopled, or my eyes deceive! Shapes watch it round, and here among the drift From flowery apple-studs a quivering bulk Half-man, half-beast, is couched. A little dread Slips through me: 'tis so novel and suspicious To see these statue-beings from the grass Reach to the low-swung branches, blink their eyes, And make no sound ... I know them! These must be The Satyrs, smug of nose, with tilted lids, Fur like the juniper and leafy smile. I know them! Woodland people, do not keep Such awe of me lest I grow terrible To my familiar self ... A sob! Alas, Your King is hurt. Drymon She stoops! Behold her, With Dryaspis propped against her shoulder: What a wail he gave and bit her hands; Now he looks at her and understands. But she ... Hylichore O lady, put him back again; In your arms he must no more remainâ He is ill, And your youth and beauty he will kill, If you lay him thus upon your heart. We, who love your voice, beseech you Lay him where he cannot reach you, In a shady place apart. Genifer Good folk, you misconceive: those who are dying Need all the love that we can giveâso sadly Their eyes and hands take leave, and they themselves Each moment miss some dearness of our life: They will not harm or curse, for in their smile Is the bare light of blessing! I would win you To help me tend your fellow. Brim this cup, Loosed from my chain, with water, fetch me branches Of streaming leaves to fan with, and large blades To lay across the hurt; fetch tormentil, Plantain, or sickleworth or Aaron's rodâ But waste no time. All Our god's own goddess, no! At your gentle word we go Leaping, running to and fro. Philampelos I for leaves and tormentil. Drymon, you the cup shall fill. Hylichore I alone! I have no fear, Now she holds him, to draw near! [to Genifer] Let me have your sacred bowl; I can dip it in a hole Where the waters must be chill. Genifer Small forester, my thanks. The Satyrs run away to serve her. Ah me, I doubtâ For death has put the severance of its cold Between me and these fingers I would chafe, This face I would relume. He looked at me With the full look that only beasts can give, And then lay quiet. Did I catch his name? Dryaspis, do not tremble! How his curls Twine bushy round his horns, how strong the strength He owned to-day ... Even now he lifts his hand As if to ward a blow. I hold you close. The lady of your woodland loves you. The Satyrs return. Hush! Drymon A leaf! Philampelos A branch! Hylichore The pearly cup Filled from yonder streamlet up. Genifer Keep your first vigil. With a perfect choice You bring me all I need: but some of you Still wanderâcall them; they disturb their fellow With noise of steps across the winter-leaves. Ervan breaks through the trees behind Genifer. Dryaspis [opening his eyes] 'Tis he! Oh, hide me in your silver dress. He wounded me. Genifer A knight all gentleness. You misconceive. But there! Lay down your head; He can not see you now. Ervan She has outsped My feet, my spear! Ah, would that she were dead. Genifer What sighs! Ervan LysithoÃ«! Dryaspis [softly to Genifer] My fear is fled. Let him draw up, close, for I am sure I have learnt a secret that will cure Those harsh sighs. LysithoÃ«â Ervan Her name! Who echoes it? Dryaspis You have been much to blame Seeking to kill her, if you hate her so: That will never stop your sighing; You must die as I am dying; And it is so soft to die. All seems happened long ago In a picture, like the lake Of the flitting wood doth makeâ I shall see it far below, I shall see it by and bye, When the current does not shake ... Ah, how dizzy is the sky! Hold my handâ He stretches out his hand to Genifer and dies. Ervan I am reproved; Even this poor fool sees clear What's to do, being unbeloved. I take his counsel! Genifer Ervan, drop your spearâ And for my sake. There is no need of speech, When life's great music thrills us as a wind, We listen to by breathing. Do not weep! Ervan You cannot know. I took from him his breath. Genifer What, will you leave me in the woods with death? Ervan A murderer flees. Genifer I loved this boy ... the restâ Give me that spearâshall not be twice confessed. Be comforted: not of his hurts he died, They were not mortal. See how from the forest His shaggy people troop to bury him. They would be private; scarcely may one see Even in sharpest winter on the moss A starved bird perish: we must suffer them To pass in silence to their rites. Ervan How firm Her hands close on the spear-head. Genifer. The Satyrs troop round Dryaspis, a little bashfully at first; then they lift him up &amp; bear him away. Satyrs We who loved him so, We would kiss and sunder; But Dryaspis will not go, That is just the wonder. What is come and gone Seems to linger on, As if yesterday Burst into our play. Look! The creature is grown gray and cold; We must carry it away To our ancient treasure-hold, The great cave we dare not nameâ Then it will be all the same. Genifer [to Hylichore, who is last.] Then you will come back into my copses. Drymon, Hylichoreâyou have taught me Each your name, and I will guard your secrets, Or will quite forget them at your pleasure. Do not fade away. Hylichore joins the troop who sing with him. We must: farewell. Drymon &amp; Philampelos Farewell, farewell: We cannot dwell With mortals by: Where the rose is plucked we die: We must keep aloof From the cotter's roof, From the smoke of cotter's fire; Come, we will retire To the moist, black mire, Where the forest sluices ooze, Where the matted shadows lie, And, by Pan's own reeds, refuse Rutted track that mortals use, Lest our pelt and hoof we lose, And our whisper from the tree. [exeunt. Ervan But, Genifer, if you will say to me What you have said to these impassive churls, Guarding my secrets or forgetting them ... But hear my oath: by me they are forgotten Abhorred, dismissed. I hate LysithoÃ«, I hate the hills Her feet have traversed, hate the wolfish hounds That bay about her, hate her huntress-dress, Her stubborn solitude, her blind recoil From man's most solemn worship. If these woods Are dear, it isâat last I understandâ It is that you, sole lady of this land Within the precincts of this shadowed creek, Have drawn me to your heart. You shall not speakâ O gracious to have spoken! Take my prayer, And hear it, would you save me from despair. Genifer I cannot speak of loveâLove is too close, And it would vex me even that a god Should ever hear the terrible, low cries Charging my heart. You found my woods so full, And they are emptied now of everything, Satyr and nymph, and what of human breath Is breathing with the leaves. There is no want That Love and Death can fail to satisfy, And these desert us never. O my magic, Enchanter of my womanhood, so dull You found me! Now there are in me such moods, The jealous royalties, the patient awe Alike of serf and queen. You will not weary, You never will have rest. Ervan O darkened eyes, Worshipped through every splendour of their storms, Give me your light again. He starts, arrested by the distant sound of music. Genifer You turn aside, Your ears are still attentive: elfin-horn No more will quick the air. Ervan Its notes I scorn. But listen! Genifer Do you deem you will not hear Within my forest any sound except The flutter of the leaves because we laid Its demon-maskers? At the name of love They shrivelled as at outbreak of the day Night's conjured spirits flee. Yet none the less Will you be visited, at unawares, By ravishing music: sometimes it will spring Within, or you will catch it indistinct As the sea's burthen when it gathers up The waters for the pressure of the tides. The senses are not blank or unattended That feed where silence is. See, from yon covert Below the ivied chapel on the steep, How gay a crowd disperses, and how white The thread of the procession in its midst: These are the country maidens met to praise Our Lady of the SummerâSee, they wend On toward the city: we may catch their voices Now nearing us, now far. Come, let us sit Together, and together mark the chaunt, That I may know I have you for my own, And stay the heart-break of the ecstasy Awed by the softer strain. Ervan Ay, Genifer! (aside) And while from Heaven's approach sweet peace she wins, I must confess how murder-black my sins. Procession of boys &amp; girls singing. AVE, most fair, Queen of our bowers, Queen of the woodlands, and the white-thorn air, Of furzy reaches, Wave-breaking, solitary beaches, And the lone farmstead in its shaded nook: Thou who dost look On moorland lamb forsook, Who in time of drought Join'st us, praying on our knees For the barley and the pease, And dost not weary of thy prayer, until The ears with corn do fill, The fallow breathes, the tender blossoms sprout: To thee we shout As children shouted on thy Son's highway, And round his ass did throng, With mimic praise, with snatch of angel-song, And sallow-flowers, On a far holiday. Procession of maidens. Ave, most meek! Before the last Deep star into the dawn had passed, We, or by lane or ferry, Had stolen, trembling, to this forest creek To deck thy shrine, Emptying our river-wood Of all we could, Of honeysuckle, blooms of dropping cherry; Melampyre, vetches, purple columbine. Nor did we quite forget, Mingling in posies wet, Woodruff and alkanet, Thy hues of robe and veil. O spotless virgin, hail! We bear with eager feet, Through tainted city-street, The fragrance of thy purity, We give our voices unto thee, Nor shall our chaunt, or our procession fail Through the blue noontide heat: But we, by moor and vale, Though our bright garlands flag, on thee will call, Beseeching thee to give us good Of thy pure maidenhood, Till evenfall. The mothers stand at the chapel-gate, watching the proccssion of maidens and children out of sight: then they turn slowly towards their homes, chaunting. Dear Mother, hail! Nor flowers in bloom, Nor chaunt we offer thee; O Lady of the tempest and the sea, To thee, long since, we have confided The children of our womb: And, by thy breast, divided Sevenfold in sorrow, by the loneliness, When, thy BelovÃ©d being gone, Even from thy rest, His tomb, Thou did'st live on, We, tempered by the patience of thy heart, Have learned to part ... We bless Our sons, we watch them forth, Not to return; and from the little path Hasting to thy green altar in the vale, Where we can see The Babe for ever on thy breast, We say the prayers of thy sweet rosary, Turn to our homes and rest. [exeunt. Genifer She prays for you. Ervan If she would pray! O Genifer, the wrong That I have wrought, that piteous funeral, And all the gaiety put out of gearâ Genifer But death must come. Ervan It is not that intrusion! Death is a simple thing to these that die Simply as Nature bids them; just a failure To feel what others feel, a shy dislike, A loneliness, a lying in the shade, And then the sudden nightfall: but his death, And all this sylvan folk without a godâ If She would pray for them! Genifer Be comfortedâ When Christ went down to Limbo, He descried How many plagued and sorrowful, how many Shut up in ignorance, from instinct missing What they had never known! He drew them forth Through the still vaults, and brought them secretly At dawn to threshold of his Mother's door, Who, first embracing Him, took, for his sake, These strangers to her heart: so we will put Dryaspis in our prayers. But jealously, Most jealously guard an undying hatred For the cold nymph that tempted him, your spear Had justly sped. Ervan Yet of our Lady's grace, O Genifer, I look into your face, Clean of blood-guiltiness. LysithoÃ«â Genifer Be prey to her own dogs. You are with me. Ervan My fiery sapphire, yes; Genifer But quick! the tide Is ebbing fast; you must not tarry here, Lest I should hold you bond. Ervan You are with me, And if I draw you now down to the boat, It is that I may cross to yonder chapel Where the good priest still lingers, wed you fast, And by all hard, inextricable ties Knit you my own. It is too perilous To guard the treasure of so great a love Till by your vows you have confirmed it mine, O Genifer, for ever. You are dumb! Genifer We travel where speech has no power: I come.</field>
