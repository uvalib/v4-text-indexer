      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene.âHall in Toppington House, extending to the back of the stage. The doors are backed by view of the distant country. Doors are closed at opening. Enter Lloyd and Davies. Lloyd. Stir! my young lady will be back at noon. The wind cuts, this spring morning. Quick, a fire! Davies. For her, indeed! Sir Joshua and my lady Will not be home till six; and for Miss Blake There's your own fire. What serves the housekeeper May do for her to warm by. Fire for her! [She goes out tossing her head disdainfully. Lloyd. Hard-hearted insolentâ Enter Jillott. Dear Mr Jillott, The wine's out; and Miss Blake will need a glass After her long, cold ride. Jil. Why, Mistress Lloyd! Of your five senses is there one remains? Shall IâSir Joshua's butlerâmake a journey Down to the cellar? open, as I must, An untouched cask? and bear the further labour Of drawing and decanting, all for her? For Anne Blake! Is that rational? Lloyd. I'd do it For any creature livingâfor a beggar, A sweep, a Hottentot! Jil. Ah! there we differ. Lloyd. But, sir, for Miss Anne Blake, remember this: She is your master's niece. Jil. Sir Joshua, I know, has the misfortune to be called Her uncle. Lloyd. [Incensed.] Why misfortune? Jil. Mistress Lloyd, Be rational. You know Sir Joshua's sister, Who might have made a creditable matchâ A match Sir Joshua prayed forâsunk herself By marrying some poor devilâscribbler, clerk, Tutor, orâI forget the man. What followed? They'd not a coin or crust. She must have starved, But that Sir Joshua received her here, With her puling baby. Lloyd. Ay, took child and mother; But not the husband. Jil. No; most properly The door was closed on him. What happened next? His wifeâSir Joshua's sisterâere a year, Frets herself out of life, and leaves my master This squalling wench toâ Lloyd. Shame! Poor innocent! Jil. Poor vixen! From a babe she couldn't bear Sir Joshua or my lady. Why, she failed In common gratitude. Lloyd. For what? Harsh words And frowns from him, neglect from her; for taunts, Imprisonments, and blows of angry nurses, To cure her temper, till she half became The sullenness they called her. Yet a heart Opener to kindness beats not. Jil. Poh, poh, poh! Hearts are low things. I speak of manners, Lloyd; And hers distress me. Well, you did good service, When, while Miss Blake was at your husband's farm, You snared that strolling artist for a lodger, And gulled him into loveâlove for Anne Blake! I hope he'll take her, and so rid my taste Of what offends it, my poor lady's nerves Of daily shocks, my master of disgrace! Lloyd. Disgrace! Isn't she flesh and blood like them, And, though she's poor, their equal? Jil. Equal! Lloyd. Ay! Jil. Equal! I'll hear no more. Such sentiments Strike at the root of order. O, you're dangerous, A leveller, Lloydâa leveller! I've no doubt You'd have the cow-boy sit at table with us And pledge us in his pewter! Nay, no more. [He stalks out. Lloyd. Why not their equal! Our Sir Joshua's father, Though London alderman and baronet, Was yet a trader, nor in wealth forgot The means that raised him. There be two extremes Of men that one can bearâthose born to station, Who take it graciously, and those who earn it; But save me from those doubtful honourables That have no root in custom, yet despise Their honest planter, labour! Had Sir Joshua Been used to rank, or won it by his wits, He'd not have shown his niece such spite because Her mother married humbly. [Knock.] A knock! not hers: There's too much flourish. Her knock's sharp and bold, As if the door, too, were her enemyâ All but poor Lloyd! [Door are thrown open by Servants, who enter. Doors remain open, admitting view of Welsh scenery in distance. Enter Llaniston, speaking to Servant, who retires. Llan. So, so, I'm out of luck! Good day, good Lloyd! Lloyd. Good day, sir. Llan. And Sir Joshuaâ Lloyd. Returns to-night at six, sir, with my lady. Llan. [Abstractedly.] Humph! Lloyd. [Aside.] Now, I told him they'd be gone a week, And thrice within the week he comes to seek them. Llan. I've called, you know, on business. Lloyd. Will you wait? Llan. I've not a moment. [Goes undecidedly towards the door, then returns.] Can I see Miss Blake? Lloyd. She's out, sir, for her ride. Llan. Humph! Lloyd. She'll be back, though, In an hour, or half an hour, or less. Llan. I'll wait. [Sits. Lloyd. [Aside.] That's odd; he said just now he'd not a moment. How can she help his business? Llan. [Starting as from a reverie.] So he's dead? Her fatherâMiss Blake's father? Lloyd. Sir, 'tis like. He crossed the seas ere she could lisp his name. All trace of him is lost, as in the wave The furrow of his ship. Llan. Poor girl! Lloyd. Ah, sir! Her life's had little sunshine, little soil; But she's a hardy nature. Llan. True. Lloyd. She has A spirit, sir. Llan. I know it. I've heard her talk. [Rising and pacing the hall. Spirit indeed! Her very words are cluffs; And yet I like them. They've a health that suits me; Because well-born and rich, forsooth, my life Has been all tame and breezeless. Gliding servants Have noiseless done my bidding; tradespeopleâ Forgetting man's a perpendicularâ Have crooked when I approached; often, even woman, Whose outside should be mirror to her heart, Has feigned the glance, the motion, and the blush Heaven meant for instincts. O, all these have closed me In a dead, sultry noon! But brave Anne Blake Blows like a morning gust from our cragged hills. I breast it, and am man! Lloyd. Hark! that's her pony. [Anne heard without. Anne. I say you must, for the beast's sake, not mine. She's hot. Walk her round gently. Sirrah, do it! Enter Anne in a plain riding-dress. She rushes up to Lloyd, and flings her arms round her neck. Is it not shame now, Lloyd, that for my sake Dumb things should suffer? Though poor Jenny smokes, The groom won't walk her round the yard. Of course not: She's mine! [With great bitterness.] No matter! Guess what I have here! Lloyd. What! Anne. [Gaily.] Five bright sovereigns! the price My sketches brought in Bangor. Now they're yours; [Gives a purse. On trust, as lawyers say! you'll give them, Lloyd, To poor sick Jervis, whom my uncle, else, Will thrust out of his humble shed for rent. And say that 'tis your gift, Lloydâno, your loan; For, as you will not ask it back, a loan Has a gift's worth, and nothing of its pain. Lloyd. Kind heart! Anne. Be promptâsave him from further shame. It makes my blood turn fire to hear a man Rated as if his sickness were a crime! Lloyd. But, darlingâ Anne. Wait! there's something more to guessâ I'd half a guinea left; what did I buy? Lloyd. A book? Anne. No. Lloyd. Crochet needles? [Anne shakes her head.] Pencils? Paper? Anne. You'll never guess. A dollâProducing it from a parcel which she carries.]âa doll in white, With eyes that move like life; but, unlike life, Ne'er fill with tears: a doll with forehead smooth, That never aches; with feathers and a sash To set her beauty off; but never proud! Now, say for whom is this perfection meant? For my pet, Minnie, Lloydâyour granddaughter. Ah! won't my little lady dance for joy? How oft I've wished I'd been a doll myself! I then had had soft hands to stroke my hair; Kind words and kissesâtill the paint wore off! [Gives doll to Lloyd. Lloyd. [Soothingly.] Hush! here's a gentleman to hear. Anne. What then? Is my tongue to be jailed because he has ears? Llan. Rather because he hears, he'd have it free And speak unchecked. Anne. Nay, your tongue forces, now, Debts on me which my body pays. See, sir, Curtsies for compliments! [She curtseys.] Good day. [Going. Llan. Butâ Lloyd. [Who goes after her, apart.] Stay! He speaks you softly. Anne. Softly! So your lady Speaks to Sir Joshua, yet I've seen him writhe. Our courteous guests speak softly when they stoop To notice the dependant. Who has ever Spoken softly to me but to mock? Save youâ You, Lloyd, and him! Llan. She doesn't deign a look. Anne. Well, he's not come? [Still apart to Lloyd. Lloyd. [Archly.] Who, sweetheart? Edward Thorold! No, not yet come. Llan. [Aside.] This is civil, on my life. [He turns on his heel, and again walks up and down. Anne. Absent again for weeks, And still he hides the cause! Nay, I'll not murmur. I've no more claim to his dear love than has The heather to the sun; yet how I dashed Down crag, through wood, o'er plain, in hope to meet him! I'm in full time; dependants should be patient. Lloyd. Nay, nay, pet! [Anne goes out dejectedly, Lloyd accompanying and caressing her. Llan. So she's gone; the porter's chair And I are left for company. [Looking off.] Here's one To make a third! Why, if I've eyes, 'tis Thorold, My hero friend from India, my rare compound Of grave and gay, whom I perhaps more love That I half fear him! Enter Thorold. Thorold. Once more here. What! Llaniston! Away from London, leaving all May Fair Under eclipse? Llan. What matter to a world That lives by gaslight? What took you from London, After your Indian triumphs, ere a maid Had asked your autograph, or a fond mother Secured you for a breakfast? Thor. [Smiling.] Business, business. Llan. Ay, true; I recollect. Thor. But recollect Most to forgetâmy name, my quality, And chief, all points between us that affect Sir Joshua. Llan. I'm pledged. Thor. You but see an artist In quest of beauty. Llan. Good! I'm on a quest After the grand. Folks call the rugged grand: I've found the rugged. Thor. Snowdon? Llan. No. Thor. The peak Of Cader Idris?âthe Pont Aberglaslyn? Llan. No; it's a sheâa girl! D'ye know Anne Blake? Thor. [Starting, but quickly composing himself.] Anne Blake! Sir Joshua's niece! Llan. The same; don't laugh. I'm that girl's slave; I've seen her thrice. Thor. [Carelessly.] Does she Encourage you? Llan. Not she. She pelts my heart With such force from her, it comes back again In the rebound. I'll win her. Ah, you know not, When women have well chased you all your life, The zest of giving chase to one yourself! I'll win her! Thor. Will you love her? Llan. By my life! Thor. I doubt that. Women who are but pursued For the pleasure of the chase, are, like its victims, Cast off when captured; and the huntsman lover Turns to new game. A wife, my friend, should be a sweet bird won To one's breast by cherishing; not a wild quarry To be hawked down. Llan. [Taking off his hat.] My five-years' senior, I bow to your reproof. In truth, dear Thorold, I own its justice; but don't balk this passion. Thor. Miss Blake will. Were it otherwise, you'd tire With your honeymoon no older than a crescent. Llan. A challenge! I'll make ready for the lists; Soon shall my constancy unhorse your scorn, While I cry, âVictory, Wales, and sweet St Anne!â [He goes out. Thor. I could not tell him in this frolic mood, Her heart had chosen me, her friend, preceptor, Met, as she thinks, by chance. Ah, now, dear orphan! Not for thy father's memory art thou loved, But for thyself. She guesses not my station, Nor that I knew her father; but her soul, Which chill neglect had frozen, at one touch Of kindness from me, thawed; and, though the current Foams at opposing wrong, its waves are clear And bright with glints of heaven! And now to see her! [Turning, he looks accidentally through window at side, and pauses. Alas! my eyes that thirst so for that sight, Awhile must wait. Sir Joshua returns, And I'd not meet her in his sight, whose taunts My prudence scarcely brooks. Brave Anne, bear on; The day is near I shall have right to shield thee! [Goes out. Re-enter Lloyd and Jillott. Lloyd. Not six yet by two hours, and here's Sir Joshua And my lady back. Enter Sir Joshua and Lady Toppington, followed by Servant and Lady's-Maid, with travelling gear. Ser. [Timidly approaching Sir Joshua.] Your coat, Sir Joshua. Sir J. Back, sirâknow your place. Ser. Yes, sir. Sir J. Why does the fool stand gaping there? Why don't you take my coat? Jil. [To Servant, who hesitatingly touches the coat.] Not so, you country loon;âso, there's your pattern. [Takes the coat from Sir Joshua, with a low bow, and flings it at Servant, who goes out. Sir J. Wait, sir. The cards. Lady T. A chair, Lloyd. My poor nerves! Jil. The cards, Sir Joshua. Sir J. Are these all? Jil. All, sir. Sir J. [Glancing over the cards.] Dobbs, Evans, Jones, the curate, Andrew Ray, From Budge Row, City! Stretch of insolence. Because he knew my father! Roberts, Owenâ There's not a name worth reading in the batch. [Flings down the cards contemptuously on salver. No callers else? Jil. [Places salver on table.] Why, no, sir, noneâ Except the Earl of Connistonâ Sir J. Except The Earl of Conniston! Dare you drag in An earl's name, a real earl's name, at the tail Of fifty nobodies, with anâexcept? Well, well, Lord Conniston calledâ Jil. At the lodge gate, sir, To ask the nearest cross-road to Llanberis. Sir J. Leave the room, sirrah. [Jillott bows, and goes out. Lloyd. He forgot to say Squire Llaniston, who's home from London, called. Sir J. [Troubled.] Squire Llaniston! Lady T. [Throwing back her bonnet, with an air of indifference.] Yes, she spoke plainly. Lloyd. And he called three times. Sir J. Three times within a week! Who spoke with him? Lloyd. Myself, sir, and Miss Blake. Sir J. [Horrified.] Miss Blake! Lady T. [In a corroborating manner.] Miss Blake. Sir J. Send her hereâno words. Lloyd. [Muttering.] More spite at my poor pet! [Goes out. Sir J. Well, madam? Lady T. Well, Sir Joshua? Sir J. You're calm Upon the brink of ruin. Lady T. [Still calmly.] Ruin? Sir J. Madam, D'ye know or not, that my estate is mortgaged To Llaniston for thousands; that last year He pressed for its redemption; that he's called Thrice in this week, doubtless to urge repayment, And that to meet his claim I've not its tithe. Lady T. You would keep hounds, give dinners, bet with lords. Sir J. Zounds! Lady T. Mind my nerves. Sir J. Nerves, ma'am! You've nerve enough To warm your feet by a volcano! Well, The money was my own. I'd none with you! Lady T. No; but you'd family. Sir J. What has it brought me? I'm shunned by the whole county. Lady T. Dear Sir Joshua, Is that my fault? You married and gained entrance To the first circles;âI accomplished that. They cut you;âyou accomplished that yourself. Enter Anne, with an air of fixed dejection. Anne. You sent for me? Sir J. Yes. Anne. Well, sir? Sir J. That's your welcome After my absence, is it? [A pause. Lady T. [Sarcastically.] Can't you say You're glad to see Sir Joshua? Anne. Madam, spare me! I'd not offend. Sir J. You're too like your low father To be grateful. Would my house were quit of you. Anne. It will be soon. Sir J. Yes, when yon strolling sketcher Makes you his wife. Why leaves he still unfixed Your marriage-day? He had my full consent To take you hence. The dolt most like repents His hasty bargain. [Anne shudders, and utters and ejaculation of sudden pain. Lady T. Nay, you use her hardly. Sir J. Let her not chafe me, then. Speak, Anne! you've seen Young Llaniston thrice? Anne. 'Twas his fault. Sir J. Well, his errand? Anne. A fool'sâhe wasted compliments on me. Sir J. What was his business? Anne. I can't tell you that; I wouldn't hear it. Sir J. Why, you never turned him Out of the room. Anne. No; I got tired, and left it. Sir J. [Enraged.] She turned her back on him! He left insulted, Enraged beyond a doubt, and for revenge He'll claim his mortgage promptly! [To Anne.] 'Tis your work, Yours who live by my sufferance, whose least crust Is given! Anne. Earned, sirânot given; it's but the price you pay To taunt the helpless. That safe luxury, Like others, must be paid for. Sir J. Minx! Anne. [With a burst of uncontrollable passion.] Be sure You shall not lose; there's one shall pay you back Each crumb you dropped me; or, if not, I'd put My blood, brain, bones to hireânay, coin you guineas Out of my life, rather than keep it bound To charity like yours. [She rushes out. Sir J. I'll tame you! Lady T. Whoâ Who would have nerves? Enter Jillott. Jil. Sir Joshua, a letterâ I may say a despatch. Squire Llaniston's groom Brought it post-haste. Sir J. Out, blockhead! [Jillot goes out.] As I said! Here's the warrant of our doom. He asks his loans, And I'm a beggarâyou too! [He opens the letter.] Have I eyes? There's no hoax; 'tis his hand. . . . Jove, how I hate her! Yet she must save me. Lady T. What's your news, Sir Joshua? Do you go to jail? Sir J. [Jocularly.] No, ma'am; 'tis Llaniston Should be confined for life. Lady T. For what crime? Sir J. Madness! But it makes well for us. He'll not press now To have his loans repaid. The fool's in loveâ In love, in downright love! Lady T. With whom? Sir J. Anne Blake!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene.âLibrary in Toppington House, overlooking the grounds. Open French window at back; groups of sculpture on either side; doors on each side; a glass door also partly open near back. Sir Joshua discovered. Sir J. Yes, yes, I thank my stars; but that I grudge The vixen so much luck, this chance falls bravely. Llaniston in love with her! A pedigree Old as the hills, and as much gold as, melted, Would make a lake between them! Llaniston Nephew-in-law to me! He can't press hardly Upon his uncle. He'll extend his mortgage, Perhaps forgive it. I can breatheâI'm saved! Lady T. [Who has entered unobserved.] You're in high spirits? Sir J. Have you seen her yet? Have you told her this good news? Does she keep her senses At such an offer? Has she yet dismissed That rambling artist? Zounds! how dare he venture To woo my niece? Lady T. She has not dismissed him; She knows not Llaniston's offer. Sir J. Quick, then, tell her. Lady T. Haste would mar all. Thorold has won her love. He showed her kindness. What accomplishments She knows, he taught her. Though she may be brought To banish him, gold will not tempt her. Sir J. Then what will? Lady T. Her proud and jealous heart; and, to say truth, I've grounds, as yet known only to myself, To question if he loves her Sir J. Will you urge her To his rejection? Lady T. Yes; for love's dream, One touch dispels, while wealth and good position Last for a life; also because you're ruined Save we've a hold on Llaniston. Sir J. [Advancing to her.] Thanks! Lady T. [Withdrawing.] No transports; They try my nerves. Both sides being duly weighed, I'd rather live in ease and bear your presence, Than starveâwith you in jail. Sir J. [Angrily.] How? Lady T. Silence! Or I'll not aid you. [Motions him off. Sir J. [Deprecatingly.] Nay, we part good friends. Lady T. Best friends, sir, when we part. A pleasant morning. [She curtseys. Sir Joshua bows and goes out. Gold is not everything. It's pleasant, too, To respect the man one marries. Once, indeed, I was love's dupe, like Anne, and half betrothed To a poor advocate. She'll have a lot Brighter than mineârank, wealth, andâno Sir Joshua! [She goes out. Enter Anne, attired in a fashionable morning-dress, followed by Lloyd. Anne. What means this change? I know its outside fair, But yet 'tis false. I feel it! This new dress, Worn at my uncle's cost, hangs on my limbs Heavier than chains. I'll cast it offâ Lloyd. Child, child, Be not so mad! Look in the glass, and see How it becomes you, beauty! Anne. [Apart.] Where is he Should guide me here? Why this protracted absenceâ The cause still hid in mystery? Thorold, Thorold! Have you too learned to stint the dues of love When a dependant claims them? Re-enter Lady Toppington. Lady T. Go, Lloyd. [Lloyd goes out: Lady Toppington sinks indolently into a chair, while Anne paces the room excitedly.] Anne! Anne. [Stopping short.] Madam, explain this riddle. Why am I Invited to your presence? Whence these gifts Lavished unasked? [Shows her bracelets. Lady T. If they displease you, choose Some other pattern. You've decidedly A graceful figure. Anne. [Impatiently.] Madam! Lady T. Stayâsit downâ You know I'm nervous. That's a charming foot! Anne. Nay, then I'll go. [She half rises, but is restrained by a gesture from Lady Toppington.] Would you indeed be bounteous, Send back these bracelets; give the poor their price. O, if you knew what joy to aching hearts This gold would bring that's idly spent on me! Take them! Lloyd has a nephew, a brave lad, Who wants a boat. Lady T. [Gently declining them.] So generous! I've oft thought We were mistaken in you. Not an hour since I said, âShe has a heartâa heart, Sir Joshuaâ Whose love we might have won.â Anne. [Softened.] Perhaps you might. Lady T. Your uncle and myself, I own, disliked you. Yet there are times when every woman's breast Yearns to its neighbour. Yes, dear Anne, I saw Too well what you had suffered. Anne. Suffered! Why? Lady T. From Thorold's absence. Have I struck too roughly A string that jars? Don't speakâ Anne. For onceâonce only. I love him, and could scarce debate his truth With my own heart. How should I then with you? Lady T. His truth! You run to extremes. He's pledged to wed you, And you may trust his honour. Anne. Do you mean That only honour binds him? Lady T. There you pain me! No doubt he means you fairly. Anne. Fairly! Ay, He'll keep his bond, you think, but curse the whim That signed it; has no grain of love to pay That sum he vowed; but O, he's honourable, And ready with the forfeit! I could blush At my own jest, such love-suitsânay, such law-suits!â The bachelor a bankrupt, and the maid His creditor; conscience the officer she fees To arrest her victim, and her heart his jail! [With constrained laughter. Lady T. I'd give the world to have your flow of spirits. Well, well, we'll hope the best; but love, you know, Is often blind. I've here a curious proof Of that old proverb. 'Tis the merest fragment Of a worn letter [producing it]; but it much concerns A friend of mine. Give me your thoughts upon itâ Nay, read it! Mark, 'tis in a woman's hand; And read aloud, that we may after join Our minds in comment. Come! 'tis a small favour. [Anne takes the letter reluctantly, and reads it carelessly at first while standing. Anne. âI have been in perfect solitude ever since you left. The rest are absent, and friends rarely find out this lonely house.â [She pauses. Lady T. Go on! Anne. [Resuming.] âYet I have not been unhappy, nor needed society. Sweet remembrances and sweeter hopesâthese have been my companions by day and night.â [She becomes gradually interested, again pauses, and sits. Lady T. Further still. Anne. [Resuming.] âAh, when I recall your loveâ when do I not?âI feel as if earth could give me no more; as if hope itself could ask no more; as if my world were filled and brightened by that love alone light of my life, my heart's sole joy!â [She lays down the letter I'll read no more; these words are sacred! O, how she must have loved! Lady T. Loved whom? Anne. You best Know that. Lady T. I do, Anne. How I grieve to say itâ Those lines were writ to Thorold! Anne. No! Lady T. 'Tis true. I found them in the library that day He bade you his farewell there. Anne. But not dropped By him? Lady T. He sought them eagerly; questioned my servants If they had found such letterâa torn fragment In a blank envelope. [Shows envelope.] I then was absent For some few hours; ere my return he left. Anne. And how came you to read a page not yours? Lady T. I thought it mine, a mere shred undirected, So read, and then read on. I'd fears for you. Anne. Most needless ones. What man can help the love Another utters? You've no proof that heâ That he returned it! Lady T. Do you think she had called him Her heart's sole joy, had he repelled her love? Anne. Cease! Are you bent to torture me? Lady T. To save you. Anne. Save? Yet rob me Of trust in him! He false! Lady T. Even if he were, There are other men alive; he is but one. Anne. [Springing up impetuously.] Ay; but one sun suffices for a world: If quenched, 'tis night, though heaven be packed with stars! O Thorold! I have known so little love, Forgive me if I wronged thee by one doubt! Lady T. Confiding girl! Give me the letter. Anne. [Quickly approaching the table and taking the letter, which she replaces in blank envelope.] No! If it be his, 'tis safer in my care. Lady T. Give me your promise, then, you'll not betray That you have learned its purport; at least, not Till I consent. Anne. [Mechanically.] I promise; as you will. Enter Jillott. Jil. The Honourable Mr Llaniston, of Llaniston, Through me, requests an audience of my lady. [He goes out. Lady T. [Aside.] I've paved his way; himself must do the rest. [After looking earnestly at Anne, who stands absorbed, she goes out. Anne. I would as soon believe heaven's arch would fall, As think him false. My heart was voidâhe filled it; Bleedingâhe bound it; fierce with wrongâhe calmed it. My comfort, guide, sole joy! Sole joy! Ah! now Those words flash back on me; another used them! Who calls him light of life, sole joy, but me? Did he permit it? Would she else have dared?â Such words of open passion! these delays Repeated of our union! Do I doubt? I must notâdare not! My faith lost, I lose All hold on good. My soul that's built on him, Would like a tower, when the earth reels, fall shattered: Fatal to all I light on! O, these words Were never meant for himâand yet! Doubt ebbs, Then flows, and gains upon me like a sea! Thor. [Without.] Anne! Anne! Enter Thorold. At last! Anne. [Rushing towards him.] Thorold! [Suddenly checking herself.] So, you're returned. Thor. What! for no warmer welcome? Anne. Why, you talk As you'd been years away, not three short weeks. Thor. Did they seem short? Anne. To you. Thor. Why, Anne? Anne. Because You're often absent. What one often does, 'Tis plain one likes; and what one likes seem short. Thor. Excellent logic! Then, because you've borne My absence often, it seemed short to you? Anne. O, I'd your letters. Talking now of letters, You're careless of them. One you dropped was found here. [Gives him the fragment in blank envelope. Thor. [Opening letter, aside.] Her mother's to her father in their wooing. Anne. Where are your thanks? Perhaps you set no value Upon the letter? Thor. Set no value! Anne. [With forced gaiety.] Ah! You do then prize it? Thor. Anne, some other theme! Levity suits not this. Anne. Why not? Thor. 'Tis sacred. Anne. [Aside.] Sacred! Thor. Another cloud. Anne. Well, can you wonder? [Struggling with her emotion.] I'm curious, and a woman. Come now, tell me Where you have beenâwhat done. Unlock for me Your Bluebeard chamber, sir. [With sudden earnestness.] I do not jest; Dear Thorold, I imploreâexplain your absence! Thor. My absence? Thrice you've asked me that before. Thrice I replied, I cannot. Anne. Will not. Thor. Anne! Where is your faith? I grant 'twixt maid and suitor Should be no secrets save what reason claims And conscience warrants. If by these compelled To veil his thoughtsâ Anne. Ayâthen? Thor. Then 'tis her part To credit the compulsion. She who loves Best shows her love by trusting. Will you trust me? [After a short pause she gives him her hand. I knew you'd give your hand. Anne. [Aside.] He knew I'd give it! He moulds me just like wax: all calm, no passion! If he loved me, he'd be angry. [Withdraws her hand. Thor. What! Not pardoned? Anne. Pardonedâby me, an outcast, a stray waif On fortune's tide, without an owner's name, Or stamped with one I scorn! Thor. Whose? Anne. Whose but his Who lured my mother from her home, made want, That cankered life, her lotâdependence mine; Who forced on me the life he left to insult? My father'sâ Thor. [With sudden energy.] Hold! A stigma, though deserved, When a child brands it, makes the hearer weigh The censure with the sin; but, if unjustâ No, no; you could not mean it! What has warped Your heart so from its course? Anne. The words of all men Who knew my father. He lacked strength to scale My mother's heightâso drew her to abasement. Thor. Did she so deem? True, he was of a band Whom fortune frowns on, whom authority Oft uses and forgets; but still, their souls Are the world's life-blood! Anne. Who? Thor. The men who think! Whose weapon is the pen, whose realm the mind. I mean not laurelled bards, but daily workers, Who, like the electric force, unseen pervade The sphere they quicken; nameless till they die, And leaving no memorial but a world Made better by their lives! Anne. You knew my father? Thor. We met abroad; 'twas in his later years; I heard his story there. Your mother held His love above the world, and, spite of menace, Gave him her hand and heart. His thrifty earnings Sufficed till fever seized him. Then on both Fell that sharp want: his wife mourned for his sake, With which his child upbraids him! Anne. [Aside.] Plain he hates me! Never would love on one brief, bitter mood Pronounce so sternly! I've at least this grace, That, heartless as I am, I free your sight Of what must needs offend it! [Goes out impetuously. Thor. Stay, Anne. Gone! My love for her lost father made me harsh. I should have thought how much that secrecy His dying breath enforced, must fret a heart Fervent and galled by wrong. I had fixed to-day To end her trial, and might do so yet, Would but this lagging mail from India bring The news I hope for. [Turning, he sees Clara Thurleigh peering in at open glass door.] Who's here? Can it be? Enter Clara. Clara. [With a laugh.] It can. Thor. Clara, my madcap cousin! [They shake hands. Clara. Yes, I found This glass door open, reconnoitred you, And so skipped in, all unobserved. You see Even marriage has not cured my pranks. Thor. [Smiling.] What could? Clara. A steady course of whipping when a child Might have done something, but 'tis too late now. Thor. Why came you here? Clara. To scold you. Was I not Your favourite cousin? Thor. [Sportively.] You! Clara. You know I was. You fell in love with me when you were ten. Deny it not! I recollect the day I had a skipping-rope and wore red shoes. Confess those shoes made havoc in your heart! Where was your conscience then to keep from me This dear delicious secret? Thor. Secret! Clara. Ay. But you revealed it to my aunt, your mother. I wormed it from her. Then a longing seized me To know your charming Anne. Some friends of Thurleigh's Live in this neighbourhood; they asked us down. Though three months married, Thurleigh spoils me still. I said, âAcceptââwe came. Thor. On mischief bent. Clara. Don't fear; I quite kept your incognito. I first called at your lodgings, and inquired For the artist, Mr Thorold. You were here: Now tell me what she's like. When shall I see her? Thor. You don't deserve it; but to-morrow noon. Clara. To-morrow noon! Thor. No sooner; I've good reasons. Clara. I shall die of curiosity ere then. Now, what have you deserved, ungracious tyrant? Not a considerate, benevolent friend, Like her who brings you this. [Gives him a miniature. Thor. The miniature! Who gave it you? Clara. The jeweller in London: You had left it for repair, he said, and wished Its quick return. Do tell meâis it Anne? Thor. [Looking earnestly on miniature.] Not AnneâAnne's mother! [Lady Toppington now appears outside, at window at back, and stops short.] They're unlike in feature; And yet at times I've caught that very look On her child's face. [Clara takes and examines the miniature. Lady Toppington now enters, and slowly advances unperceived: Anne also enters by window unperceived by Thorold and Clara; Lady Toppington seizes her hand, and points to Thorold and Clara; Anne attempts to withdrawâLady Toppington forcibly detains her. Clara. Yes, I half guessed this would ensure my welcome. Thor. A double welcome, for its sake and yours: You could have given me no more sweet surprise. [Clara returns the miniature, on which he gazes intently. O, I could bend for hours above this face, Lit with devotion, meek, yet brave in trial! Why, why should bitter fate be love's dire foe, And sever hearts that with one instinct thrillâ Beat with one pulse? Clara. [Earnestly.] Perhaps, that we might know Love's constancy. How could we prove its strength But for its trials? Thor. [Warmly, and taking her hand.] Said like you! There shone The generous soul that, seen through all disguise, First made me love you. Clara. [Affecting dejection.] Love me! so you say. Thor. And so you know. Now leave me. Clara. [Warmly.] Dear, dear Thorold! But we shall meet to-morrow? Thor. Yes, at noon. Be more discreet though; meet me at my lodgings. This for the portrait. [Kisses her, then walks with her to door, by which Clara goes out. Anne. [To Lady Toppington.] Let's go! Lady T. Soon. [They retire a few steps. Thor. [Returning, his eyes bent on the miniature.] True heart! How blessed had been my lot, had Heaven so willed, To take thee to my home, to say, âAll joy Sits circled round my hearth, for thou art here!â To greet thee with the tenderest tones of love And reverent duty; with a life's devotion Console thee for the past. It may not be. How like that look to hers! [He kisses miniature; at an imperative gesture from Anne, Lady Toppington bears her aside, near window and retires behind a group of sculpture, which conceals them; Thorold, after a pause. Shall I seek Anne, And tell her all? Perhaps 'twere best. Anne, Anne! [Goes out. Immediately afterwards, Lady Toppington comes forward, supporting Anne. Lady T. [Looking at Anne, who seems in stupor.] She would have fled, but that by force I held her. Poor girl! Speak, love!âyou heard?âyou heard, I say? [With great gentleness. Anne. [Faintly, rousing herself.] Thank youâI heard. Lady T. You did not see her face? Anne. No. Lady T. Nor I, plainly. But you saw him take Her pledge of loveâher portrait? Anne. Hers! Lady T. Whose else? Even grant it were another's, what avails it, Being plain he loves that other? But you saw His kiss that paid that gift, and heard him say He loved her, and lament the bitter fate That severed them. Anne. [Regarding her keenly.] Go! you're his enemy! This isâ [Falters. Lady T. [Still holding her.] My work? Why, were I twenty times His enemy, could I have done this? Had I witchcraft To make them meet by stealth, change gifts, embrace, And plan a next-day's meeting? When she went, Was it I who made him press his burning kiss Upon her painted semblance, while he cried, What bliss it were to have led her to his homeâ That home where she had made his bliss complete? Anne. Release me! Lady T. Now all's clear; no need to ask Who wrote to him those passionate lines of love You read to-day. Anne, he may marry you, His word being pledged; but he loves only her. Forgive the cruel truth. Anne. Your arm is iron, It crushes me; let go! I want breathâbreath! [She breaks from Lady Toppington, and falls prostrate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene.âA richly-furnished drawing-room in Toppington House. Anne discovered seated on a low stool, her arm supporting her head. Anne. He loves anotherâloves another! Why, I dwell upon the sounds as if repetition Could exorcise their sense. My heart rebels 'Gainst eyes and ears. Have I not seen his kiss Pressed on her cheekâay, on her painted cheek, With warmer glow than met my living lips? Is not my brain seared with his words, that told How blessed his home had been if shared with her? Her letters too! He was her light of life! 'Tis true, dupe, true! As drowning men recal Old dreams of shipwreck, and in horror's face Gaspâthis is sleepâI cling to hope till billows Of proof o'erwhelm me! Yes, he loves another! And for his vows to me, I stand a debtor To pity, jealous pique, a hasty moodâ Which he repents of. Shall that promise bind him Which does not bind his heart? I flung mine wide To hail him, like a loyal city's gate That hails its king! If there he finds no home, He shall not find a prison. He's free as air! Free as the light he brought into my gloom, And now takes back and leaves meâ [She gives way, then, after a pause, starts to her feet. O shame, shame! Where is my pride? Enter Lady Toppington and Llaniston. Lady T. My will's imperious; You'll stay and be our guest. [Linking her arm in Anne's.] Join with me, love. He can't refuse two ladies. Llan. [Who bows, aside.] Who's the second? Sure not Miss Blake. She met me at the door, And deigned me as much notice as the threshold. Lady T. Silence consents. You'll stay; and to ensure Some life in these dull quarters, and reward Your prompt obedience, hear what I proposeâ We'll act a playâ Llan. Charming! Lady T. If we can call A company together. Once we played âThe Story of a Duchess.â Here's the book. I have at hand the dresses, parts, costumes. Amuse each other till I bring them. [Apart to Anne, who turns away, and fixes her eyes intently on a marble group.] Anne! Be kind to him. He loves you, and has made you An honourable tender of his hand. [She goes out. Llan. [Aside.] She turns from me. Our hostess, gentle lady, Bade me amuse you. Anne. She imposed on you A hard employment. Llan. True. I'd choose another. Anne. Do so. Llan. I'd woo you. Anne. Then, sir, you'd succeed In your first taskâmy amusement. [Shes retires. Llan. Well, jest on; Frown if you will, but hear me; let me plead. [Follows her. Enter Thorold, the miniature in his hand. Thor. I've sought her everywhere. [Aside, looking off.] What! her aunt here! And Llaniston! I must choose a fitter time For this dear giftâthe all that earth retains Of her loved mother. Lady T. [Re-entering, coming to front with robes, a coronet, and MSS., she observes Thorold, lays them down, then speaks aside.] Thorold here! There's danger That must be met; for pity, though not love, May bind him still to wed her. Ah! what now Rivets his eye? That portrait! Anne! Llan. Unkind And sudden interruption! [Thorold advances to Llaniston. Lady T. What! You know him? Llan. [Hesitatingly.] Know him?âO yes. He calls himself an artist. Lady T. Nay, is one. [To Thorold.] That's a portrait. May I look? Your pencil's latest, doubtless? Thor. [Reluctantly.] Madam! Lady T. Why, You seem reluctantâquite perplexed. Real talent Is modest! I insist. [She takes the portrait, and turning to Anne, apart, opens the case.] I've somewhere seen A face which this recalls! Where, where? 'tis fancy. Look, a fair face, love! [Gives her the portrait, then aside.] Marked you his confusion? [Anne with an effort suppresses her emotion; they affect to examine portrait. Llan. [Apart to Thorold.] Deuce take me if I understand your mystery! Thor. At least respect it. Not a word, be sure, Of aught between us that concerns Sir Joshua! Llan. O, he's your object; mine's his niece. Remember You challenged me to win her! Thor. Have you won her? Llan. Not yet; she's flint; but I'll strike fire from her. Thor. The spark will scorch you; she'll remain a stone. Lady T. [Returning portrait to Thorold.] A face that's full of interest: we both thought so. [Apart to Anne.] Look how he turns and lays it next his heart! Courage he'll see you tremble. Anne. I don't tremble. [Aloud.] Come, come, the talk dies out! One's thoughts grow numb. Who'll stir the mirth into a blaze? Will you? Llan. Gladly! [Bringing Thorold to Lady Toppington.] Lady Commander, a recruit For your company, not of dragoons, but players. Lady T. Ay, true, our dear theatricals! All's ready. [Showing separate MSS. Here's each one's separate part. Group round and listen, While I explain. [Aside.] I'll turn this to account. [All walk to places. Our heroine's a young girl whose mind and beauty Raise her from life's low level to a dukedom. The duke who weds her is, of course, the hero. Llan. I'll be the duke! Anne. [Forcing gaiety.] Beware, sir, your stage-lovers Have oft sad endings. Llan. Yes; sometimes they die. It's worth the risk of dying for to woo you. Anne. [With laughter.] Ah! that's because you're vain, and don't believe I'd suffer you to die. Lady T. A sharp retort! Llan. [Apart to Thorold.] Did you mark that? What think you of her now? Thor. Think! that she's in good spirits. Llan. Nay, she melts. Look on, and see me win her. Lady T. [Resuming.] You're the duke, then, And Anne your duchess. [Gives each of them a manuscript character. Llan. I'll play my part to the life. Ah! would 'twere for life! Anne. Life's a long time. Let's see you play the lover For half an hour first. [Aside, glancing at Thorold. He's calm. My caprices Disturb him little. Llan. Come, begin! But Thoroldâ Lady T. O, I and Mr Thorold take small share. The humble lover, he who, as he ought, Resigns the maid, withdraws his flickering light When greatness breaks upon her path like day. I'm but his sister, who advises him To that just course. Llan. Begin, then. First let's try A scattered speech or two to test our powers. Say this, where the duke enters. [He leads Anne forward.] That's the page. Permit me. Lady T. [To Thorold.] With what spirit they adopt This project. [Thorold takes the book. Llan. Ready! [Reads from the MS., using his glass, and reciting in the style of an amateur.]âScene, a rustic cottage. Enter the duke.â Alone, my Marguerite? You turned surprised there. Anne. Right! [Reads from MS.] My lord again Beneath this humble roof! Direct your feet To loftier homes, for your high state more meet. Llan. 'Tis inner worth gives rank to outward place; The cot's a court if filled with human grace. The rudest niche is hallowed, if it hold A saint within; and men who delve for gold In the mean earth, rise princes. Let me be More rich than theyâto stoop and riseâwith thee! Anne. Thrice have you urged on me this suit before, And thrice have I refused. Llan. I'll urge the more! Be rock, and my strong sea of love divide, It ebbs but to return a mightier tide; Repelled again, more high the billows roll, And sweep at last, resistless, to their goal! Maiden, I claim this hand! [He kneels and kisses her hand. Lady Toppington applauds. Thor. [Interposing between Llaniston and Anne.] Stay, Llaniston; that's not the stage direction. He doesn't kneel and kiss her in the book. [Shows the page. Llan. I did it upon instinct. Anne. [To Lady Toppington.] Is he jealous? Lady T. Jealous, with that cold eye! No; but he's proud, Nor brooks another's homage to his bride. I'll sound him, though. Converse with Llaniston. [Anne and Llaniston retire. To Thorold, who advances.] I see this pains you. Thor. What? Lady T. Nay, if your eyes Are closed, my lips are. [Looking towards Anne and Llaniston. Thor. Yes, you're right; I'm pained For Llaniston, who may build delusive hopes On her gay humour. I've no fears for her. Lady T. You're so confiding. Birth and wealth like Llaniston's Are strong temptations. Thor. Not to Anne. Anne. [Who laughingly releases her hand from Llaniston, and comes with him to front.] Nay, nay; To your task! Llan. A cruel task to feignâ Only to feign I love you. You had driven The play duke to despair. Anne. [Recklessly.] He was repulsed Three times, you know. 'Tis you would have lost patience! [Crosses the stage excitedly. Lady T. That's a fair challenge. Llan. So I count it. Thor. [Apart to Anne.] Anne, A word. This frolic mood gives Llaniston warrant For hopes you little dream of. Anne. Are you sure That I don't guess them? Thor. I should grieve you did. I would not think you jest with him. Anne. Jest with him! I jested once; but 'twas before I knew His high condition. He's the nephew, sir, And next heir of an earl. The man can give His wife a coronet! Jest with him!âjest! [Aside.] He thought me heartless; now he'll find me so. Come, friends, the play! Thor. [Apart.] Have I heard right? What, Anne Barter her childlike truth and plighted faith For rankâfor gold! 'Twas wanton humour; yet This morning's freezing welcome, her aunt's warningâ I'll end this doubt. Anne. Proceed! Llan. 'Tis Thorold's turn To play the lover. Thor. Ay, the humbler one Who yields her to the duke. Not till he knows Her heart is with the duke though. Here's a passage Strikes me. I know the words.â [He lays down the book, and advances to Anne, who stands apart. Go: I release you! She can nought impart, Who, giving all beside, withholds her heart. Did those eyes smile, I should recal they smiled On loftier love, and deem my own beguiled. Discord to me the tones, though soft and clear, That make like music in a rival's ear. I gave thee all my heart; as on a throne Thou there hadst reigned, if reigning there alone! But she whom from my breast capricious will Or pride can tempt, that throne shall never fill! Llan. Excellent! you quite make the part your own. [He is about to come forward; Lady Toppington restrains him, exhibiting robes and coronet. Thor. [Apart to Anne.] I felt as 'twere my own. Anne I had acted Even as that lover. Anne. A threat! Thor. No; a warning. If that ambition or caprice have swayed Your heart to Llaniston, your fate were wretched To call me husband; but if from vanity, With no intent to wed him, you would rouse A true heart's hope and love, his fate were sadder Who called youâwife. Anne. [Aside.] O prompt excuse to snap The chain that galls him. Thor. Hear meâ Anne. No; I've chosen. Here, sir, our pathways part; you're free for ever! [Turning to Lady Toppington.] What have you there? Lady T. The duchess' robe and crown. Thor. [Apart.] This change should be the work of years not moments. She false! she heartless! Enter Sir Joshua with a sealed letter. Sir J. It's absurd; It's too absurd. Lady T. What now? Sir J. A messenger, Who swears that Colonel Thorold's in the house, And claims admittance. Lady T. Well! Sir J. He brought this letter, Just reached from India. Thor. India! Give it me. Sir J. 'Tis not for you or yours. Though you're called Thorold, I judge you're no relation to the colonel. Thor. No, sir, I am the colonel. Llaniston? Llan. 'Tis true, indeed; you speak with Colonel Thorold, The gallant hero of our last campaign. Thor. Give me your pardon. [Takes and opens letter. Sir J. [Staggered.] Is it possible? Llan. Ay, sirâa man of wealth and family That few can boast. Sir J. A downright gentleman! I thought he lived by his talents. Thor. [Reading apart.] The Indian minesâ 'Tis news indeed. Friend, give me joy! Those mines In India, where I'd risksâ Llan. Which you thought desperateâ Thor. Prosper past hope. They've hit on a new vein! Llan. Brave tidings! [Shakes Thorold's hand. Thor. [Resuming the letter.] Ah! what's here? âWait your returnââ My return! Then I'll be prompt. I'll save her, snatch her From this corrupting air. Sir Joshua, One title you've allowed. I claim anotherâ Your niece's guardian by her father's will. I'll bring full proofs, with reasons that till now Obliged concealment. Hold the lady henceforth At my disposal. [Going. Sir J. What? her guardian! Pooh! Her guardian! stay, stay! [Follows Thorold out. Lady T. [To Llaniston.] Learn if this be true; She's much moved. Go! [Llaniston goes out. Anne. [Musing.] So his fate were sad Who called me wife! He said it! Thorold! Lady T. [Playfully laying her hand on Anne's shoulder.] Dazed! Well, so you should be. A rich, high-born guardian Dropped from the clouds! I suppose, now, you'll wed him? Anne. For his wealth, when I dismissed him poor? Lady T. Dismissed him! Well, then, 'twould look, I grant, should you relent, As if his fortunes bribed you. Anne. I'd let despair Gnaw through my heart first. Lady T. Right! that's spirit, girl! I love those flashing eyes. Stand so, and humour A fancy that I love. They're but the robes Of the play duchessâ[Disposing them round her.]âWait the coronet! [Places it on the table at Anne's right. A perfect picture! You were born to rule, To shine amidst the brilliant! Ah, there's oneâ Heir to an earldom heâwho sues to give No mock robes to my Anne, who'd bind her brows With their fit emblem, rankâwho'd not repent His vow to a dependant! Anne. Ah! Lady T. Whose pride Would be to watch her triumphs. Anne. [Suddenly.] 'Midst those triumphs Should I again meetâ Lady T. Thorold? Yes! Anne. [As to herself.] He'd feel I lost him, and could liveâno sickly flower Nipped by his frost; but the plumed tree that shoots From the scarred rock, and thrives on desolation! [She pauses with sudden calmness, then drops the robe at her feet. Off, off, mock shows! I grasp realities. Heart that has ne'er been loved, whose love was scorned, Freeze till that weakness perishâfreeze, but shine! Who thinks, when glaciers flash, 'tis only ice That glitters in the beam! [She stands lost in thought. Lady T. [Who has retired a few steps, intently watching her, now approaches.] Anne! Anne. Ah!âYour hand! We should be friends. I'll marry Llaniston!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene.âDrawing-room, as in Act III. Enter Thorold and Llaniston. Thor. Nay, friend! a truce to jesting. You, indeed, Propose to marry her. Llan. [Sitting.] Asked like a guardian! Do you indeed propose? To think now, Thorold, You should turn out her guardian. Yes, we marry, That is, with your consent, if she decides so. Thor. Then she yet doubts? Llan. She bade me wait her answer Soon in the library. [Looking at his watch.] Cupid and Hymen, 'Tis near the hour! [Rising. Thor. [With indignant surprise.] You trifle! Llan. Don't object To my poor Cupid. He's a comelier god Than Miss Blake swears byâPlutus! Thor. How? Llan. You know Your ward so little? She has a sparkling eye, But shrewder than 'tis bright. Sir, by her sex Nature has spoiled a lawyer. There be women Who shine in drawing rooms; some captivate On horseback; some are irresistible In kitchens; but her sphere's a pleader's chambers! Some charmers lure by dress; some melt by music; Some, with the imperious lightnings of their eyes, Effect a breach in hearts; some awe by learning; She's none of these; her forte's arithmetic. You should have heard my wooing An hour back. âAnne, behold me at your feet,â I cried.ââYou'll give me hope?â What was her answer? Straight to the point. She asked my yearly incomeâ Netâafter all deductions; if indeed I were a peer's next heir; would live in London, Take her to court, mix with the world, and see She matched its proudestâfor all which perhaps She'd give me a wife's duty. As for love, I must omit that trifle. Thor. Well! Llan. I promised. Her frankness suits me. I prefer a hand Labelled for sale, to one that coyly slides Into your palm, and tingles for your purse. Thor. [Energetically.] It shall not be! Llan. It shall, if she consent. My truth's engaged to it. Are you a rival, That you would thwart me? Thor. No; for me love's spark Glows not within her breast; but, sir, I knew And loved her father. When in India, One high in rule aspersed my soldier name, His honest, fearless pen disproved the lie, And won me back that amulet true souls Must wear or perishâhonour! We grew friends, Heart friends, until he diedâmost poorâmost noble! I'd save his child from sin. Llan. Sin! Thor. That black sin Which vows what the heart shrinks from. You have said She loves you not. Llan. You're warm, I find, sir. Time Cuts short this conference. [He bows coldly, and goes out. Thor. Nay, I follow, then. Anne, Anne, whom I so lovedâmy once betrothed! I bear thy loss; but could I bear thy shame? [He follows Llaniston out. Enter Sir Joshua, Lady Toppington, and Anne. Sir J. But hear me, my dear niece! Anne. Leave me, Sir Joshua! You may trust me, madam. Lady T. You'll give full consent To Llaniston's suit? Anne. I've said it. Sir J. Quick, consent, dear Anne, Say, quick! My maxim is, âSecure the bird While the lime's fresh.â 'Twas so I won your aunt. Ha, ha! You'll heed my maxim? Anne. If you'll leave me To ponder it. Sir J. And, further, niece, don't tell him You take him for his money. Men don't like it. Truth isn't told at all times, and in courtship One never tells it. Anne. Yet that very truth I'll tell unless you leave me. Lady T. [Apart to Sir Joshua.] You'll spoil all. Sir J. I'm not at ease. She'll change her mind, and Llaniston Call in his mortgage.âOne more word, and then I'll go indeed. You're sure you'll not relent, And marry Thorold? Thorold, who despised The poor dependant! Anne. Listen! By each good Men value,âby what gold or a lord's smile Is to your heart, or pride to my own crushed heart, Or prayers to dying lips,âI take my vow, Poor and dependant, never to wed Thorold! Lady T. There, there, be satisfied. That vow would bind her Though her life paid it. Come! Sir J. Farewell, dear niece! You'll be discreet, now? Lady T. [Forcing him off.] Come! Sir J. A quick consent. You'll give a quick consent,âyou'll heed my maxim, âWhile the lime's fresh,ââha, ha! [Goes out in glee with Lady Toppington. Anne. [Looking after them.] Were my mind less fixed, 'Twould swerve revolted from the path you travel. No matter now. One impulse, like the glare Of a volcano inwards, lights my soul, And shows it its own natureâfire and stone. My tears, that burned like lava when they fell, Like that congeal to rock. One hope, one aim, One pulse of life,âthat I, the poor, abased, Deserted outcast, by my will and brain Rise to far heights of power, of woman's power, To dazzle and enslave! Then he may feel I had the strength to rule; I might have had The strength to love and bless!âNow to my fate. As she advances to door, Thorold re-enters and confronts her. Thor. Stay, Anne! Where would you go? Anne. To the library. Thor. Upon what errand? Anne. [With haughty coldness.] Sir! Thor. You doubt my right to question?âI'm your guardian. Anne. But not my jailer; 'tis my will to pass; You block my way. Thor. And is it I alone That block your way? Are there no crowding shapes Such as the soul seesâyouth's sweet instincts gazing With sorrow-stricken faces, memory, conscienceâ To warn you from the gulf? Anne. I've not the brain To solve a riddle, nor the time. Thor. Then wait, And hear me solve it. Your way leads to Llaniston, And you'd accept his suit. Anne. [After a pause.] You're right. Such is My way and purpose. Shall I pass? Thor. Not yet. Anne. I must, save force should bar me: quit my path! Thor. You fear to hear me speak, then? Anne. Fear! No, speak! [She sits, and coldly motions him to proceed: a pause. What's your theme? Thor. Guilt! You would marry, yet deny the love Makes wedlock sacred. Anne. Do you boast heaven's right to judge the heart? Thor. No.âHave I misjudged yours? Say that, and go! Anne. I'll pay the forfeiture of my own deed. Thor. Do you know that forfeit? Anne. Count it, if you will, And then see if I shrink. Thor. Count what she forfeits Who weds and gives no heart! I'll try, though words, Which figure outward loss, appraise not ruin In things immortal. First, she forfeits truth; She forfeits womanhood in love, its essence; Cuts off earth's blessed commerce with the skies; Profanes all sacred forms; makes home a sound, The temple an exchange, the shrine a counter, The grave a common sod, where never kneels Love that points upward! Anne. [Aside.] And this thing he made me!â The peril's on my head. [Half rising.] Thor. And would you brave What freezes me to tell? Hear my last plea; Then as you will. Alas! no parent's voice May warnâimplore! I'd speak of yours, I'd tell you Why you ne'er knew a father. Anne. Speak. Thor. You know already How toil brought sickness, sickness poverty; Howâbowed in mind and frameâyour father sat By his cold hearth, yet from one faithful breast Drew warmth and hope. Before him knelt his wife, Your mother! Anne. Well! Thor. He loved her, as they only Can love who sufferâloved her, soul and form! Her form was as the crystal to the light; Her soulâthe light that filled it. Yet they parted! Those twin lives broke, and blent on earth no more! Anne. What parted them? Thor. Well asked! What could? Not want,â They had quaffed it to the dregs, and in its cup Pledged love anew; not exile,âwhere he stood Was home to her; not chains,âher faithful tears Had rusted them to free him; not the seas,â They had foundered on one plank; not Iceland snows,â You had tracked her footfall there! All these, men brave For Gold; why, Love had mocked them! Anne. Tell me, then, What severed them? Thor. They had a child, an infant. Famine was at their threshold. For their child Those true hearts quailed. They sought your uncle's aid. He offered shelter to the wife and babeâ Denied it to the husband! Anne. And my father? Thor. Strained Your mother to his breast, as though that strain Could lock out time and death, till soon their eyes Lit on the form that clung for life to hers; They saw its wan, pinched cheek, the blight of want Creep on their blossom;âthey could save it! He With one long kiss, till their souls met, again Embraced his wife, unwound his beggared arms, And said, âWife, go!ââAnd, for her child, she went! Anne. [Aside.] I must quit or yield. [She rises. Thor. [Detaining her.] You were that child!âfor you They wrenched the bent of lifeâslid from the raft That buoyed their fainting limbs, that you might ride The sorrows where they sunk! Anne. Cease! Thor. Will you pay That mighty debt by sin?âa sin that mocks The love they worshipped! See, your mother speaksâ She pleadsâlook in her face! [Snatches the miniature from his breast, and places it in her hand. Anne. Her face!âthat portrait My mother's face? Thor. Even so. Anne. My mother, mother! [She bursts into tears, and sinks on her knees, reverently pressing her lips to portrait; Thorold gazes on Anne with deep emotion, and goes out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene.âLibrary in Toppington House, as in Act II. Enter Sir Joshua and Lady Toppington. Sir J. Refused him! Anne refused him! Lady T. Calmly, firmly! I've seen the letter. Sir J. Refuse Llaniston! Twelve thousand pounds a year, and a near earldom, Flung back like a gown in tatters! Why, it's impious; It's crossing Providence;âand he'll claim his mortgage! Ungrateful minx, to ruin me, her friend And benefactor! Lady T. Hush! She'll marry him. Sir J. She'll notâto spite me. Lady T. But she willâto escape you, And she has no choice. Mark! I've persuaded Llaniston, Not her own will refused him, but her guardian's. He'll wait a second answer. Thorold leaves At once for India. It seems some mines there Have brought him sudden wealth. Sir J. [Impatiently.] There's luck! 'Twas said Those mines would fail; shares went for nothing. Now Their owners turn out princes, and count thousands For their risked hundreds. There's luck! [Paces the room, then composes himself.] He has no thoughts, though, To waste on Anne. Lady T. And she would rather starve Than be his debtor. In great poverty Her father died. Llaniston had that from Thorold. Her only choice, then, lies between her suitor And you, her benefactor. O, she'll marry! Sir J. Ay, or repent it. Hush! she's here. Enter Anne, simply attired. Anne. I came, Madam, to tell you what 'tis fit you learn. I've pondered your friend's suit, and have refused it. Sir J. [Ironically.] Can you deign your reason? Anne. [Gently.] Yes, he's generous, And merits love. I felt none. Sir J. O, we're meek, We're nice, it seems. We can so well afford The luxury of a conscience. We can't marry; It wounds our principles! Let principle Feed, clothe, and house you. Lady T. Stay, unmanly tyrant! She'll hate you. Sir J. Let her! She'll the sooner seek A husband's shelter. Lady T. [Kindly to Anne.] 'Tis your last resource. He'll grind you into dust. Your pride forbids All thought of Thorold; nay, your vow. Anne. [Emphatically.] The sin Of my rash, selfish heart, which his recoils from, Forbids it, too; nay, could he pardon, still The poor dependant, who forsook him humble, Will never share his greatnessânever, never! Save time could work a miracle to show 'Twas love, not fortune, swayed her. Sir J. [Aside, exultingly.] Then all's safe. She's in my power! [He moves to door. Lady T. Yield, Anne! Anne. Go, madam! [Lady Toppington follows Sir Joshua out. Plunge back into that guilt whence Thorold snatched me! Yield! Never. He loved me! 'Twas my mother's face Stung me to jealous madness. [Gazing on the portrait which she wears.] Had I but Subdued my pride, sought him and told my doubts, All else, perchance, like this, had been explained; Dispelled like vapour, and I had not driven Full on the rock that shivers me! Too late! Enter Lloyd, followed by Clara Thurleigh. Lloyd. A lady, sweet, would speak with you. Anne. With me? Clara. [Advancing, and offering her hand.] A friend compelled to introduce herself. [Lloyd goes out. Am I so frightful that you thus start back! Anne. [Aside.] The very voice of yesterday! Clara. Well, well, Where are your arms? Love me, and love my dog, The proverb says. 'Tis surely right to add, Love me, and love my cousin. You love Thorold, And I'm his cousinâlove me! [Seizes her hands and kisses her. Anne. Cousin! Clara. Yes, His favouriteâdon't be jealousâfavourite cousin. You're still suspicious? Sometimes cousins marry. Take comfortâI'll not steal him, for two reasons:â I wouldn't if I could; and, next, I can't. In short, I was, three months since, what I hope To see you in three weeksâa happy bride! Anne. Married! You! [Aside.] O blind, wilful, faithless heart, For this I wronged him! Clara. [Aside.] What's amiss? [Aloud.] Where's Thorold? He promised me, himself, to make us known At noon to-day; but at the appointed hour My knight evaporates, and, in lieu of him, I only find his trunks all ranged and packed For instant flight. Anne. [With an effort.] He's going thenâhe leavesâ He leaves our neighbourhood? Clara. He's going! He leaves our neighbourhood! Where does he go, then? Surely you know?âThere's something wrong; dear Anne, Don't turn from me! What, tears? There's no division 'Twixt you and Thorold? Anne. Severanceâutter, final! Clara. What has he done! Anne. Discovered a mistake. He deemed he had in mine a true fond heart; He found it mean and treacherous! Clara. And repentant. Go to him, tell your fault, and be forgiven! Anne. Impossible! Clara. Anne! Anne. Spare me! Clara. Well, I'll leave you; But hear me first. The want of one frank word May blight a life. You are yet in time; speak now. If dumb through pride, you'll let a moment pass So rich, that all your sum of future years May ne'er redeem it. Take a sister's counsel, Who, having many faults, can pity yours. Again, I sayâtell all, and be forgiven. [She kisses Anne; as she is going, Anne turns to her, and falls sobbing upon her neck, then motions her away; Clara goes out. Anne. Forgivenâwhen he deems I cast him off For the sake of prouder fortunes! Oh, he must Despise me now! The tears of my remorse He will not see nor heed. Within his hand Mine will not anchor when storms lash me on, And when I die, upon my upraised eyes No love will float from his; but once he loved me, And I will keep my soul inviolate, To his love's memory! Enter Lloyd, cautiously. Lloyd. Darling pet, dear child, The colonel's here, and asks an interview Ere he sets sail. Anne. Sets sail! Lloyd. For India. You must have heard it? Anne. No; or heard it but As in a dream. Sets sail for India! Lloyd. It's strange! all's strangeâthat he should prove a hero, A great man the world talks of, one whose name's In the newspapers! Why, all the tenants round Are bent to honour him, and in procession To see him to his ship! Anne. To his shipâHeaven bless them! They know his worth. Lloyd. [Observing her emotion.] Nay, bird, he's little worth Who'd wrong or slight thee! Anne. Lloyd! Lloyd. Don't thrust me off. I meant no ill. I'll call him kind, to please you. He may forsake you; all may; but not Lloyd! Anne. Dear Lloyd!âHe waits. [Lloyd snatches her hand, kisses it, and goes out. Is it real? To meet once more, Then part, most like for ever! To think to-morrow Even the white speck of his sail will vanish, And a whole life slide from me in an hour! Is it real?âI must be calm. He shall not catch One cry of this wild grief. For me, who left His lot when it seemed lowly, now to plead For his compassion, as I sought to share His state and affluence, would seem doubly base.â I could not bear that pang! Enter Thorold, followed by a Servant with casket and packet. Thor. So, friend! the casket. [Takes it and places it on table. Ser. A packet, just delivered, sir! [Hands it to Thorold, and goes out. Thor. [Opening it, and taking out a deed.] Ah, from Llaniston! [Looking at Anne, who affects to occupy herself with books and prints. How all unmoved she looks! She never loved me. [Advances to her with casket. Anne, 'tis our farewell meeting! Anne. So I've heard. Your called hence suddenly. [Points to a chair. Thor. And ere I leave Would end a guardian's duties. It may chance I shall return no more. Anne. [Aside.] No more!âYou've friendsâ I mean you've friends in England, who would grieveâ That isâregret to think so. Thor. [Turning aside with emotion.] What we two Seemed once to one another, and we part For ever with regret! [After a pause, with forced calmness.] Regret's the word; It suits our life.âHope sinks, the dark abyss Parts, closes,âand all's sunshine! Anne. Ay, above! [Aside. Thor. [Opening casket.] We trifle and waste time. First take this token, Your mother's hair. Your father's farewell words; Her letters to him; some were in their courtship, Some traced the year she died. [Giving them. Anne. [Aside.] Her letters! Dupe! The words I read were hers. Thor. You weep,âah, wear In your heart's depths their memory, though mine Has no more place there! Anne. Yours no place!âyou think! No matterâ Thor. Anne! Anne. [As with sudden recollection.] Ah, I can speak! Mark, Thorold, I've vowed, and here repeat my pledgeâ Thor. Hold! hold! Anne. Never to link my abject lot with yours! 'Tis sworn, the choked tide's free,âI love youâlove you! [Sits at table. You can't misjudge me now! Thor. No. Anne. Hear me still, You'll not to-morrow. You have seen me rash, Wilful, unjust;âworseâay, you must have deemed so, Basely ambitious, bartering for gold And rank your priceless love! O Thorold! 'twas not A hireling heart's indifference; 'twas a proud, Stung heart's delirium! Thor. Ay, say on! Anne. From childhood, Friendless, despised, a common mark for taunts That poisoned where they pierced, you met me, saved me; My mind grew happier, purer, nearer yours, TillâO deep shame!âdoubt sprang there; I was tempted By wiles that looked like truth to think you faithless; Mock proofs swarmed round me, ringing in my ear This knellâHe too abandons! There my soul Lost light, chart, compass! I but knew one star; It vanishedâand I struck! [Casts herself before him. Thor. [Attempting to raise her.] Rise, my poor Anne! Anne. One boon! when you are happy, If 'midst the beaming faces round your hearth, Should steal the phantom sad of her you loved So nobly, who repaid your love so ill, Think her not heartless!âThink that, night by night, She pours for you the prayers God only hears, And, as some uncrowned queen still keeps the look Of greatness, feeling she was royal once, So she who found in you her world, her crown, Will liveâwill die, moulding her heart, mind, life, To make her worthier of one thoughtâyou loved her! Thor. Rise, I implore! Enter Sir Joshua, Lady Toppington, and Llaniston. Sir J. [To Anne.] Rise, don't you hear the colonel? [She rises. [Apart to her.] He'll none of you. A marriage contract waits Your signature. Anne. It must wait. Sir J. Do my will, Or quit my doors. [Losing all self-control. Llan. Silence!âI sought a wife, and not a slave. Lady T. Remember, Anne, your vow! Poor and dependent, I'll ne'er wed with Thorold. Thor. Was that your vow? Anne. It was. Sir J. Ay, word for word. Thor. Then I annul it. [She starts up.] No dependant stands there! Those Indian minesâ [Laying his hand on casket. Sir J. Are nought to her. Her father Died poor. Thor. Most poor. For in those mines he risked his allâ Half a life's earnings to redeem his child. That darling hope seemed blighted; the scant ore Scarce paid the miners' toil, and with vain throes For the far heart he might not clasp to his, Her father died. Sir J. Ay! Thor. He diedânot his act! Still delved the minersâdelved till earth revealed A veinâa realm of wealth! Sir J. How? Thor. In the outcast Behold the heiress; in the maid your fraud Divorced from love, theâ[Turns to Anne.] May I speak that word? Your no dependant now!â Anne. Yes, speak. [He opens his arms, into which she rushes. Thor. The wifeâthe wife! Sir J. 'Tis falseâyou fool me! Thor. Her father's dying breath Bound me to silence on her fate while doubtful, That hoping nothing, failure might not wound her. Hence I concealed my guardianship and station: For her dear self I wooed herâfor myself She chose me! Llan. Humph! that's soothing, since I've lost her. Thor. [Gaily.] Nay, she's more yours than ever; you most prized her When she was hard to win; you'll doubly prize her Now that's impossible. [Anne smilingly gives Llaniston her hand, then turns to Thorold. Enter Clara Thurleigh by window. Clara. [To Anne.] Why, here's a change! Here's sunshine after storm! I'll wager, now, If he still means to leave our neighbourhood, He'll pay for double places when he travels. Sir J. What means this gross intrusion? Thor. Clara, stay. 'Tis my request. Sir J. Yours, in my house! What next? Enter Jillott and Lloyd hastily, by window. Jil. Sir Joshua, the tenants, and a mob Of theâhem!âinferior classes, through the gates Pour in by hundreds. Lloyd.
