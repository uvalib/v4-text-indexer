      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. âA Street in Murcia. The Count of Ortiz and Mordax enter, as from a Tavern. COUNT (singing). Wine! wine! The child of the grape is mine. We'll nurse it again and again, Until it array the brain With wit, or until it expire In hot desire, And then we'll drink again, &amp;c. MORDAX. Count! COUNT. I am well, quite well: the air blows fresh. MORDAX. If ever you should go to Lapland (mark! To Lapland, where lean witches sweep the moon), I'll lend you a broom to ride on. COUNT. Ha, ha!âwell? MORDAX. I will, by Sathan! You shall be equipped With expedition for a northern journey. But speak,âand ere the morning stars look pale We'll breathe above the Baltic. COUNT. Ha, ha, ha! MORDAX. I'll take thee there upon a goat's back flying: Look! amongst all those lights. Dost see'em twinkling? COUNT. Away! I could not do an impious deed Before the eternal splendour of the stars! MORDAX. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Now 'tis my turn to laugh. By Momus, you jest well. Didst ever hear Of Agaberta, that most famous witch? COUNT. No. MORDAX. Thou shalt see her. She shall give thee philtres, So thou mayst change to air, or walk in fire. COUNT. Peace, peace! no more. The place seems full of frenzy. Millions of sparks go dancing through the air: My brain grows sick and dizzy. How is this? An armÃ¨d phantom seems to gaze upon us! MORDAX. That is my master. COUNT. What, you piece of cloud? MORDAX. Ay, sir, you lofty gentleman. Folks say He was a gambler once, and dared a stake Such as before or since was never won. He lost, indeedâ COUNT. 'Tis gone! MORDAX. He came to show How tenderly he watches over us. Hark! there are footsteps coming: This way, sir. They must not track us. Hush! COUNT. How the wind wails! [Exeunt. Don Ferrand and Inez enter. DON FERRAND. Look! where they go, well mated, (rake and knave), The tavern brawler, and his crookÃ¨d friend! INEZ. Uncle,âbeware! DON FERRAND. If the fierce devil still Sends out his brood to blacken this fair world, That slave is one; he with the dusk brute visage, And shuffling gait, and glittering scorching eyes. INEZ. But Manuel, sir, has nought in common with him. The Count of Ortiz, be whoe'er his mates, Owns something still, methinks, which asks respect. DON FERRAND. So! so! You love him still? You, Melchior's daughter, With half a kingdom for your dowry. Good! INEZ. I love him?âWell, I love him. What must follow? DON FERRAND. Nothing; all's said: The worst extremity Of baseness and enduring grief is touched. INEZ. Speak gently, sir; and speak more nobly too, Of one who (though now fall'n) was good and wise: Valiant he is, sir, and a peer of Spain; And on his brow wears his nobility! Why do you scorn him, sir? He ever spoke Kindly of you: and when my father's fame And tottering greatness asked for some strong help, He pledged his honor for his truth, and saved him. DON FERRAND. That story wants but truth. If time be givenâ INEZ. If time be given, he'll force the world give back Its bright opinion, sir, and show him honour. Oh! then (if he return, and stand redeemed From his wild youth and beâwhat he may be) Soon shall the poor maid cast her mask of pride, And look, once more, love upon Manuel! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. âAn underground Cemetery. The Count and Mordax are dimly scen descending a broad flight of steps in the distance. MORDAX (entering). Adieu, Sir Phosphor! For thy light, take thanks! We've barred the world out bravely, noble count! COUNT. Where are we? What! is this the road? 'tis dark. MORDAX. Ay; but as fire is struck from out cold stone, We'll pluck bright wonders from this world of night. One of earth's wisest sons, 'tis said, taught men That they should seek her subtle secrets, not In their near likeness, but in opposite shapes. COUNT. Ho, speak! Who goes? I thoughtâbut no; 'twas nothing. MORDAX. 'Tis nought. Look up! This is a cemetery. Take care, else you may stumble on a king. Holla! Methought I trod on a fool's skull. This is a learned spot; perhaps a bed Of full blown doctors:âthey are harmless now! COUNT. You are a nice observer. MORDAX. Oh! I am used To choose 'tween knave and fool. Dost thou not see, There,âa pale stream of light, run to and fro, Threading the darkness?â'tis a madman's wits. COUNT. Where are we? Let us go. The air is close: And noises as of falling waters, mixed With strange laments and hummings of fierce insects, Take my ears captive. MORDAX. O fine harmony! 'Faith, they have dexterous fiddlers here. Who blows The trumpet honeysuckle in my ear? Speak out, Sir Gnome. Hush! hark! That gentleman Who beats the drum must be a cricket? COUNT. 'Tis one. MORDAX. Right, or a death-watch. Now, sir, what's the matter? COUNT. I felt a clammy touch, as cold as death, Flap on my cheek, and something breathed on me An earthy odourâfaugh! as though the tongue O'er which 't had passed had fed on worms and dust. Again,âwho goes? Dost thou not hear a trampling? MORDAX. Be calm: 'tis but some people from the moon, Or the star Venus, or from Mercury, Madmen, or rakes; or monks,âfellows who feed On air, and rail against our homely dishes. A plague upon the spiritual rogues, They always abuse their betters! COUNT. Hush,âsweet music! The air is vital: every pore seems stung Until it whispers with a thousand tongues! Voices are heard; faintly at first, but becoming gradually more distinct. SPIRITS (below). Come away! come away! SPIRITS (above). Whither? whither? SPIRITS (below). Come away! come away! And leave the light of the fading day! Thorough the vapour, across the stream Come,âas swift as a lover's dream! Come hither! come hither! come hither! Over the wood and over the heather! Where winds are dying Along the deep; Where rivers are lying Asleep, asleep! SPIRITS (above). We come; we are coming; but whither? SPIRITS (below). Come hither, come hither, come hither! CHORUS. Hark! hark! hark! hark! A power is peopling all the dark With wonder; life, and death, and terror; And dreams which fill the brain with error. The elves are coming in glittering streams, Loaded with light from the moon beams; And the gnomes are behind in a dusky legion, Hurrying all to their earthen fare: A VOICE. Stand, and gaze! for now ye are In the midst of a magic region! MORDAX. Dost hear, Count? Look about! What see you, sir? COUNT. I see a vault,âspectral,âimmeasurable, Save that at times its gaunt and stony ribs Bulge through the darkness and betray its bounds: And now come countless crowds (millions on millions), Whirling like glittering fire-flies round about us. By hell, the things seem human! Let me pass. MORDAX. Stay, stay, sir: use more patience: you'll dislodge These piles of coffins. Kings and counts lie here, sir, Shouldering each other from their places still. The villanous lifeless lump of clayâ COUNT. What's that? Methought I heard the arches crack:âLook, Look! The pillars are alive! Each one turns round, And scowls, as though the weight crushed in his brain! Dead faces leer upon me; figures chatter; And from the darkest depths watch horrid eyes! Let me come near thee. MORDAX. Rest here. COUNT. Ha! I feel As though I leant against an iron shape. Thy sinews (and thy heart?) are firmly knit. MORDAX. Never did nerve or muscle yet give way, From fear, or pity, or remorse, or love! Never did yet the bounding blood go back Into its springs, or leave my dusk cheek pale. But, I'll not boast at present. Some dull day I'll tell you all I've done,âsince Cain went mad. Meantime, let's see what comes. How fare you now? COUNT. I feel more firm since I did lean on thee. But, hark! the ground labours with some strange birth. What volumes of dark smoke it sends abroad! Blow off the cloud! [Mordax blows, and a Mirror is seen. What's here? Methinks I see A mighty glass, set in an ebon frame. MORDAX. Right, sir; true Madagascar; black as hate. Now then we'll show you what our art can do: Wilt have a ghost from Lapland or Japan? Speak! for 'twill cost a minute, and some rhyme. COUNT. You're pleasant? MORDAX. Sir, they'll not obey plain prose. Whate'er my friends, the utilitarians, preach, Verse has its use, you see: but listen, senor. âCome! Without torch, or trump, or drum, Every fine audacious spirit Who doth vice or spite inherit! By His name, long-worshipped 'round All the red realms underground, I bid and bind ye to my spell! By the sinner who doth dwell In the temple, like a saint! By the unbeliever's taint! By the human beasts who riot O'er their brothers graved in quiet! COUNT. You have a choice collection of quaint phrases. MORDAX. I picked 'em up, as men of reputation Steal musty phrases from forgotten books. But how's this? 'Wake, dust o' the earth! Are ye deaf? Mischievous? mad? or spelled? or bound in brass? Away! a million of you tumbling imps That jump about here! Hence, and drag before us A squadron of sea-buried bones. Begone! Ravage the deep, and let us see your backs Crack with a ship load from the ooze. Oh, ho! Dost thou not hear him? COUNT. A strange noise I hear. MORDAX. It is the Atlantic stirring in his depths. Dost hear his spouting floods? Hark! Banks and cliffs Are broken, and the boiling billows run Over the land and lay the sea-depths bare! Now shall the lean ghosts laugh and shake their sides, Cramped by the waves no more! COUNT. How the winds blow! A Throng of Shadows rush in. SHADOWS. We come: we have burst the chain Of slumber, and death, and pain. The ice bolts could not bind us, Though they shot through our shrunken forms; And we left the swift light behind us, The wrack and the howling storms. A Group of Spirits descend. FIRST SPIRIT. I have trod the frozen mountains. SECOND SPIRIT. I have winged the burning air. THIRD SPIRIT. I have left the boiling fountains, Which, like flowers rich and rare, Spread their leaves of crystal high, In the lonely polar sky! A Crowd of Indian Spirits are driven in. INDIAN SPIRITS. We are come: we came in legions From the flat and dusky regions, Where a wooden God they own. We have perished bone by bone, Crushed beneath the giant's car, While our mothers shouted far, Over jungle, over plain, And drowned the discord of our pain! MORDAX. You see, sir, you may choose your company. COUNT. No more of this; which may be false,âor true. [Spirits fade away. Let me see one I know to be now dead. MORDAX. Dost see this tawdry coffin? It is now A prelate's palace,âBishop Nunez' see. The poor at last can come quite near this saint: Nay, 'round him, now the worms are met in council: Cossus and Lumbricus are chosen presidents; The one because he is a judge of learning, And t'other has taste in flesh. Wilt see your friend? COUNT. No, let him rest: poor Nunez! What lies here Beneath this heap of rough and rotting boards? A felon's body! Well, what shall be done? MORDAX. Kick it, as you would spurn an enemy! [Count touches it with his foot: the boards crumble away and a body is seen. COUNT. Ha! Sanchez! Thou false friend! Rise up, ye rocks, Pillars, and floors of stone! Rise up and crush The villain downwards! Hell hath let him 'scape. MORDAX. This rogue looks paler than his shirt. COUNT. Look there! The name of Sathan is not on his brow. MORDAX (looking). Nâo: there's no name. COUNT. And yet, in his black heart, The devil lived, and swayed him like a slave, And laughed, and lied, and with a glozing tongue Cheated the world of love. MORDAX. What, this poor worm? What, he with his throat cut from ear to ear? Ha! ha! O mighty man! COUNT. He slew my sister, So good, so fair, so young! MORDAX. I warrant you The gallant's sorry enough now. Begone! [The figure sinks. But how's this? you look pale, sir. Lean on me: I'll be the reed, at least, if not the rock. But, hush! strange music, like a swarm of bees, Seems oozing from the ground! VOICES from below. Hush! there is a creature forming: Earth is into beauty warming; Between dust, and death, and life, There is now a crimson strife: Between fire and frozen clay, Water, ether, darkness, day, There is now a magic motion, Like the slumber of the ocean Heaving in the sullen dawn! Is the cloud withdrawn? A VOICE. 'Tis withdrawn! Friends and foes are met together, Like a day of April weather, Beauty hand in hand with death; What is wanting?âonly breath! The Shadow of the Body of a Girl rises. COUNT. Speak, ere I look. What comes? MORDAX. A sleeping girl. Yetâround her white throat winds a dark red line: What can it mean? COUNT (looking up). Ha! 'tis herself, dead, dead! Poor girl, poor girl, too early lost! Was Fate (Who gives to all the wretched store of years) A niggard but to thee? MORDAX. Now, let her pass. COUNT. Yet one look; for methinks it is (though pale) A pretty picture. When stern tyrants perish, False slaves, or lustful men, we look and loathe The ghastly bulks; but Beauty, pale and cold, (Albeit washed never in Cimolian earth), Like the crushed rose which will not lose its sweets, Commands us after death. She sleeps, she sleeps! Have you no power to wake her from her sleep? To give the old sad accents to her tongue? MORDAX. 'Tis past my power. COUNT. I'll give theeâ MORDAX. Noble Count, Dost think I'm bought with gold? COUNT. I'll worship theeâ MORDAX. Umph! that sounds better. Yet, I cannot do't; or must not. Wouldst thou have The dead turn traitors and betray the grave? COUNT. Didst thou not swear that I should look through time? See joy and sorrow? wherefore drag me here? MORDAX. Sir, you shall see the future, if you will. But, patience! This fair thing must vanish first; And then we'll try your fortune. Say farewell! COUNT. Farewell, my dear oneâHa! be gentle with her. (Dirge, during which the Body sinks.) Lay her low in virgin earth, Till she claim a brighter birth! Let the gentlest spirits weave Songs, for those who love to grieve; Maidens, mothers, lovers (they Who have locks too early gray), Fathers who are tempest tossed, Widows who have wonâand lost! Children, fairer than the morning, They who die and leave a warning, With the unhealing wound, whose smart Never quits the childless heart! COUNT. Now let us look on that which is to be. MORDAX. My glass is there: yet, ere you gaze, think well. The futureâ COUNT. Bid it come, as terrible As tempest or the plague, I'll look upon't, And dare it to an answer. Methinks I feel Swollen with courage or some grand despair, That lifts me above fortune. Quick! unveil Your dusky mirror, you, lords of the mansion! MORDAX. Base goblins, quick! Unveil your lying glass, And let my lord look in. Now, noble Count, What see you? [Shadows appear on the mirror. COUNT. Ha! MORDAX. Two figures, like ourselves! We're linked together, Count? COUNT. True; but thy shadow Wears a strange cunning look and quivering eye, And the face changesâHa! from young to old, From fair to darkâfrom calm to smilesâto mirth! From mirth, look! intoâHa! Diabolus? [Turns round quickly. MORDAX. What is't? COUNT. 'Tis gone! Methought thou didst assume a fearful visage. Let me look on thee, nearer: no, thou'rt fair, As fair as truth. MORDAX. No fairer? COUNT. Wouldst thou be Whiter than truth? MORDAX. Why,âno: in fact, my notion Is that she wears a much too cold complexion. Now, sir, I like the olive,âor the black. Then, she was naked, too, or poets lie: Give me some covering, though't be but a mask. COUNT. That was a fearful face I saw! MORDAX. Forget it. Let us consult the mirror once again. [Other Shadows appear. COUNT. Heaven! 'tis herself, my love, my dear, dear Inez! She will be mine. After Love's fears and pains, The god sits crowned with roses! What are they? MORDAX. Your children. COUNT. Both?âHow fair! no lily fairer. See, with what matron smiles the mother bends, Kissing their veinÃ¨d temples with her lips! Mine? mine? all mine? O, Fate, why did I swear Hate everlasting to thee? I abjure My rashness at thy feet. MORDAX. Had you not better Dip once again in the dark lottery? Perhaps this spring may change. But see, what comes? [The Shadows alter. COUNT. A thin shape comes: 'tis like myself; so like, That, but 'tis younger and more spare and pale, I'd sayâ'twas I. MORDAX. This phantom never lived. COUNT. I'll call it. Thouâ! MORDAX. Be still! You must not talk To that which ne'er was flesh. Unto my ears Confide your transports: We may talk together; Though not to them. These pigmies are as proud As a rich tradesman, or a new-made lord. COUNT. Who is the vision? Speak! MORDAX. It isâyour son. COUNT. Forbid it, Heaven! Sickness or want hath struck This pale thin boy with death. Must he then bear Youth without blossom? without age, decay? After all childhood's ills and pains endured, (Before life's sweets are blown) 'tis hard to die. Let him not perish! MORDAX. Do you pray to me? COUNT. I had forgot: methought the thing was real. But, see, he comes alone!. Shew me the rest, All the fair shapes, and she, the first and fairest, Whose beauty crowns my dreams, whose heart is mine, My own! Not all your juggling tricks can shake My trust in her unmatched fidelity. MORDAX. I said not she was false: she is most true. COUNT. O, my fast friend! MORDAX. But beauty still is frail; And what dishonour could not, Death has struck! COUNT. Ah! MORDAX. Stand up, Count! What, fall at the first word? Why, this is but the future. (Aside.) The weak fool! COUNT. O thou false friend! (He turns his back on me.) Is there no hope, no way, noâ? MORDAX. None; yes,âone! COUNT. Quick, quick! MORDAX. You need but change your livery, Count. You've served one thankless king in camps and councils, Have got hard knocks, no rank, and little pay; Have been dishonoured! What else need be said? Push him aside, and choose a better master. COUNT (pauses). Umph!âhe must be a king. MORDAX. He is. COUNT. A great one. MORDAX. He is a king more vast and terrible Than any one whose cannon shakes the world. He hath huge hosts, wide realms, and such a power As the strong tempest hath when it is wroth. Fate cannot awe him: Death is sworn his slave. COUNT. What devilâ MORDAX. Huâsh! You've guessed well. Hark! his nameâ [Whispers. COUNT. Avaunt! What art thou? Who art thou? MORDAX. Your friend! [The figure of Mordax changes. Your fellow, too, who'll save all those you love: But, still, you must be prompt. Your vow runs thusâ COUNT. I will not hear him. Ears, shut up your sense! MORDAX. Choose and be quick, Count; for you're in some peril. The Inquisitors have scented out your path, (They are brave bloodhounds), and will soon be here. COUNT. I care not. MORDAX. But they've racks, which change men's humours. Then, for the things thou lovest, their graves are open: Wilt save, or thrust them in? COUNT. Be dumb, thou tempter. Turn your red eyeballs from me. O, 'tis fable, Black, base, unfounded, false: what else? what else? Yet, if it be,âand I can save them thus? [A noise is heard at a distance. MORDAX. Hark! they are on thee. COUNT. Ha! is death so near? No matter; let it come. I shake like fear! MORDAX. I still can save thee, thee and all thou lovest: Quick, speak the word. COUNT. The word! what word? Speak on. [Voices are heard without. MORDAX. They're at the door. Say thus: âI give my soulââ COUNT. Stay! stop! What shall be done? Now, life or death? The grave for her,âor love? God help me! Ha! I'm safe: 'twas a wild struggle; but I'm safe. Fiend! I abjure thee, (falls down), loathe thee. OFFICER (without). Open the doors, In the name of the most Holy Inquisition! MORDAX. Ha, ha! the holy rogues!â(whispering) You still may choose, Life, love, and wealth? or the rack and scaffold? Quick! OFFICER (without). Burst through the doors! [The doors are broken open, and Officers, &amp;c., of the Inquisition enter. Ho! seize upon him. Ha! My lord of Ortiz? Sir, Count Melchior heard You were beset by some fierce enemy, And sent us here to save you. Raise him up! Now, where's your foe? Seize on him! A VOICE laughs. Ha, ha, ha! OFFICER. I hear a horrid voice, but nothing see. Spread yourselves out, and search the vaults with care. Haste, and let none escape. COUNT (faintly). 'Tis vain: he's gone! Wherefore he came, or who he is, or wasâ OFFICER. We do not ask: Our master bade us say He'd speak in private with you. COUNT. He is wise; Wise, good, and gentle, as a great man should be. Bring me before him: I will try to thank him. I'd go, but cannot. VOICE laughs again. Ha, ha! OFFICER. Lean on me. Now let us haste: Methinks strange sin and horror Tenant these lonely vaults: Perhaps they sit Watching the couches of the wicked dead! Come, let us go: to the Count's house, my lord? COUNT. Ay, strait, strait, strait: (Aside) and strait to Inez' bosom; Which was (and must once more be) my sweet home! [Count, &amp;c. exeunt.</field>
