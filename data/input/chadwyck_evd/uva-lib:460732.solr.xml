      <field name="fulltext">THE LIFE AND DEATH OF LEO THE ARMENIAN. (EMPEROR OF ROME.) A TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSON√Ü. Leo, the Armenian. Emperor of Rome. Michael, the Amorian. His brother soldier and supplanter. Theodotus, the Patriarch. Theodore of Studium. Captains of the Army‚ÄîPriests‚ÄîTwo Conspirators‚ÄîMonks‚ÄîGaoler‚ÄîCitizens of Byzantium. The Empress. Helena, a Lady of Honour. Children of the Empress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. ‚ÄîA Tent, near Byzantium. Night. Michael; afterwards Leo. Michael. At last I see The prize within my grasp. To-morrow's dawn Finds Rome arrayed against the opposing hosts To conquer or to fall. If she should conquer Then were the Emperor's throne fixed on a rock And I obscure for ever. Should some panic Force back her arms, 'twere otherwise; the bolt Which spares the lowly saplings of the wood Shatters the heaven-topped pine; the angry people Letting their vengeance fall on C√¶sar's head Would spare his generals,‚Äîwhen he is gone, And his throne empty, who remains but I, The darling of the army, the brave Captain Of twenty fights? Shall it be Aplaces, That hot-brained fool, without a thought in life Only to hack and thrust? My comrade Leo? That cold half-blooded pedant, with his babble Of duty to the State; half saint, half sage, And no-wise soldier, he who stole my love‚Äî I hate him‚Äîhe to step 'twixt me and power? Nay, that he shall not‚ÄîI am no mere creature Of pure philanthropies and cloistered virtues, But a strong soldier willing to dare all To compass my desire. See, here he comes, The hypocrite! I hate him! Good night, comrade. Is't well with thee? What think you of the morrow? Will victory be ours? It should be surely, We do out-number them. Leo. Michael, I know not What fortune keeps for us; but this I know, Some boding presage of impending ill Weighs down my soul, and will not let me rest. I see before my eyes our Roman hosts Driven backwards, and the fierce barbarian levies Press onward, and the Imperial Crown of Rome Tottering on C√¶sar's brow, and a strange voice Crying of ‚ÄúTreason, Treason!‚Äù day and night, ‚ÄúBeware of traitors!‚Äù Mich. Comrade, thou art dreaming. What traitors are there here? not thou and I, Nor Aplaces; and if not we, what other? We are the Generals. Leo. Nay, not Aplaces. I see him bathed in blood, his men surrounded And dying where they stand. Mich. Then who was it Who played the traitor, comrade, thou or I? Leo. Speak not thus, Michael; think of the old days When we were boys together, our young hearts Filled with high dreams of a regenerate Rome. Could we from such high thoughts sink down so low, Now in our golden Mid-summer of life, As Treason? God forbid. For Aplaces No truer, loyal heart, or braver soldier E'er faced the foeman's steel. Mich. Ah, that is well. He leads the van to-morrow. If victory Smile on him, then he need not play the traitor. 'Tis certain ere to-morrow night has come The army, which is now your Kingmaker, Will thrust the dotard C√¶sar from his throne And set this paragon there. Leo. Aplaces‚ÄîC√¶sar? Aplaces, set himself before his country? Nay, nay, you do not know him. We have fought Together twenty years, and though no bond Of close necessitude links us, such as binds Michael to me, yet are we comrades too, Welded in one, at the fierce forge of war, And knit by common perils. I would answer For Aplaces with life. Mich. It may be, comrade, That thou art right; but hast thou pondered well, Thou who so hatest the idolatrous crew Who come 'twixt thee and God, what power it is Lurks behind Aplaces? The Priest's‚Äînone other! Dost thou not know that in his warlike tent The sacred ikons meet his waking eyes The ikons watch his sleep, the crucifix Through all the storms of battle next his heart Wards off the foemen's steel? Dost thou not know How gloomy he has been of late, how full Of boding dread, of sick remorseful fancies And superstitious fears? Dost thou not know 'Tis in such rugged penitent souls that priest-craft Finds its best prey? What hope you for the Empire If he, his brave soul whistled down the wind To the idolater's lure, should, at a sign Of his masters, stoop and tear the bleeding heart Of the true Faith, and in its stead enthrone Some base corruption? Leo. Michael, dost thou speak Of vague suspicions or of certain proof? Such doubts unman me. Mich. Leo, I have spoken Of certain proof, which shortly I will show thee; But now too great a danger presses us. We must defeat him and his priestly crew. Far better the Bulgarian than the Priest! Leo. Nay, what Is it thou would'st? The proofs! the proofs! Mich. I have a letter from the Patriarch To whom he makes confession; this a creature Of mine has intercepted. In it they plot That if to-morrow fortune crowns our arms Some trusty officers among the army Shall straight acclaim him C√¶sar, and the Empire Be his to make or mar. Leo. Michael, I hate These gross idolatrous knaves, but am a soldier And know a soldier's duty. Mich. What is there That doth conflict with this in what I would? Thou knowest that Aplaces commands to-morrow The Thracian and the Macedonian levies Filled with young northern soldiers, and the flower Of all the Imperial host. For thee and me Soft Asiatics, prone to coward panics, Peril our name and fame. Were it not well For the Empire if the brunt of battle fell On those most fit to bear it? Let them first Take all the onset, while we hold reserved The troops, too weak to attack indeed, but able To end what is begun. If Aplaces Should force the foemen back, then it were ours To crown his victory. If he should fail, We hold our troops unbroken to push back The weakened enemy. In either fortune We save the Empire, whether from the Priest Or the Bulgarian. Leo. Michael, I dare not. There is no rule but duty; serving men, We serve God best. Mich. Good comrade, sleep on it. Thou mays't serve both. Thou art not thyself to-night. Take time, the dawn to-morrow sees the onset, Heaven keep thee safe. Leo. Michael, I care no whit Whether I live or die; but Aplaces, If he be what thou sayest (and who shall doubt it), Would ruin Rome. For these Bulgarian robbers We hold them safe‚Äîagain, if not to-morrow It matters not, but an Idolater Fixed on the throne of Rome, it were too much! It must not be! But what if he should fall In the unsupported onset? Mich. Nay, he will not; He is too strong for them! Leo. But for his levies! How doom those brave young lives? Mich. As for his levies; Why, what are soldiers, if they face not peril Where glory waits them? And if they should perish, A soldier dies but once! Leo. Shall he then fall? And shall I be a traitor to the State? Was this my dream‚ÄîAplaces bathed in blood; And voices calling ‚ÄúTreason‚Äù? I cannot bear it! I will have none o't! Mich. Nay, but Aplaces On C√¶sar's throne, the truth of Christ o'erborne By dark idolatries! Leo. Nay, call me Traitor, Dyed with a thousand treasons to the State, But faithful to my God! Mich. (aside). I have him safe, And the Empire in my grasp! SCENE II. ‚ÄîThe Field of Battle. Alarms and Excursions. Michael, Leo, Roman Captains and Soldiers. 1st Captain. The day is lost‚Äîthe fierce Bulgarian hosts. Press on us everywhere. Fly, comrades, fly For safety, ere they take us, and their horsemen Transfix us as we flee. The Emperor Has fled the field long since, the Roman power Is broken in pieces. 2nd Capt. Comrades, we are betrayed. Some cursed treachery has done this thing, Not the Bulgarian strength. Our Generals Are traitors. Where was Michael, the Amorian, With all his men, while the brave Aplaces, Hurled his stout Macedonians on the front Of the Bulgarian host? He is no coward, Therefore the more a traitor. Where was Leo, The Armenian, and his force? I cannot doubt him. He is too true a soldier, but I fear Lest Michael has beguiled him. 1st Capt. Stay not, comrade. Save thyself! All is lost! [Exeunt‚Äîhurriedly. Enter Michael and Leo. Mich. All has gone well; Aplaces is disgraced; the Emperor Fled to Byzantium, and our routed host Flings down its arms, and all the country side Is sown with swords and shields. Leo. My dream! My dream! And was it I that did this treachery? I who have fought by Aplaces' side so oft? The van driven back, the arms of Rome disgraced? It must not be. Nay, Michael, I must go. It is not too late. I will to horse, and rally The shattered van-guard. Michael, do thou take Thy men and stay the torrent. Lose no moment. Follow while there is time. Mich. Stay, Leo, stay! 'Tis useless. All is lost. Dost thou forget Our compact? Leo. Nay, I was a fool, a villain, To listen. 'Tis no compact which can bind An honest soldier; treason, blood-shed, murder, Nought else. Nay, I must go, and thou wilt follow. Is it not so, Michael? Prithee lose no moment. All may be saved. Think of brave Aplaces! I will fling myself on those barbarian hosts, And save the van. [Exit‚Äîhurriedly. Mich. Fool, fool! Insensate fool! Gulled by a tale too weak to cheat a child. Go thou, then, to thy death. My path is clear, I have no rival now. The Emperor Has fled, and I am Emperor of Rome. Soon I will count with those Bulgarian thieves. I will not leave one of the curs√©d crew To trouble us again. When I am C√¶sar, As now I must be, for the army loves me Beyond all others, I will straight take measures With the Priests, with the army, with each power that comes Betwixt me and my will. [Exit Michael. [A noise of shouting heard. Leo re-enters, borne back by soldiers. 1st Capt. Nay, General, It is too late, but we have seen thy valour! If valour could have saved us, then wert thou Saviour of Rome; but 'twas too late, too late! Thou could'st not more than man. Comrades, behold Your General who dared all things for you, Who, when the fierce Bulgarian charged and broke Upon you like a flood, and overwhelmed The struggling van, like some tall sea-beat rock Stood steadfast with his levies, and beat back The onward rushing surge, but now, God wot It is too late to win; not even Leo Could save us; the dull bigot whom ill Fate Thrust on the throne of C√¶sar, long has fled The blood-stained field, we have no chief but Leo; He is our C√¶sar! Leo. Nay, but Aplaces, Who has ta'en the glory of the day; I would give My life to be as he. He is your C√¶sar, No other! What is victory or glory To loyal duty? I would liefer take Aplaces‚Äîwho had dared and lost his all, But kept his duty, than the laurelled head Of a too cautious soldier, who has kept His fame but lost his honour. 1st Capt. Such as is Michael the Amorian. 2nd Capt. Where in truth was he, Michael the bravest soldier of his time, First in a score of fights? I tell you, comrade, I marked him and his levies. Not a blade Of theirs e'er crossed the foemen's. When they saw Brave Aplaces o'erborne they did not stir, And when men asked why thus they stood inactive, They said, with broken voices hoarse with rage, ‚ÄúOur General has ordered.‚Äù When the rout Bore down on them, they advanced not, nor stood firm, As Leo, but in orderly array They got them to the rear, and now have reached Half way to Adrianople. 1st Capt. Treason! Treason! And Michael is the traitor. Leo. Ah, my dream! Nay, nay, you are mistaken. Let me go. I will save Aplaces! 1st Capt. Nay, General, It is too late! Leo. It is not too late, I say, Let me to horse! Enter Soldier in flight. Soldier. Good comrades all, I pray you Hearken, what dreadful news I have to tell. The brave John Aplaces and all around him Are slain; I saw them fall. I saw his body, When Leo's men pressed the Bulgarians back, Lie bathed in blood, pierced by a dozen spears, And savage sword cuts. Leo. Oh, my dream! My dream! Oh Aplaces, my comrade Aplaces, I would I were as thou! 1st Capt. Nay, thou art Rome's, And thou alone canst save her. Comrades all, I do proclaim our sole remaining leader, Leo the Armenian, who has kept his faith, C√¶sar of Rome! Soldiers. We do acclaim thee C√¶sar. Enter Michael. Leo. Nay, nay, you know not all‚ÄîI will not take it; I am a simple soldier, vowed to duty, Or once I was! and would continue in it. I do refuse your homage, kneel not to me! But to dead Aplaces. A Soldier. We do acclaim thee C√¶sar of Rome. See, there the traitor stands! Seize him, and kill him, comrades, let him die A traitor's death. Mich. (aside). Leo, if thou art C√¶sar Thou mayest save me. If thou dost reject The proffered homage, but a single word And thou wilt never more see wife nor child; I will denounce thee. Leo. Nay, I care not, Michael, For death, thou knowest. Soldiers, Citizens, Be not thus rash! I pray you let not grief Make you unjust. If C√¶sar you will have me, Who am less worthy than the meanest footman Who marches in your ranks‚Äîthus let it be. I take the unwelcome gift. For this our comrade, Michael, I do believe that he is loyal As he was ever brave. If I accept The crown your favour offers, I will make Full inquest of this thing. If any show Unfaithful to the State, then shall I purge them With fitting punishment. Mich. I do surrender My sword to you, my liege, and kneel before you, A suppliant for justice. Soldiers. Long live Leo! Long live our Emperor! We will proclaim him In Saint Sophia's!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. ‚ÄîLeo's Palace, Byzantium. Leo. One little week has passed since the great fight Which wrecked the power of Rome, the fight which found me An honourable soldier, but has left me Dishonoured and a murderer at heart, But Emperor of Rome! How small appears The Imperial Crown, Earth's highest dignity To him who by deceit has climbed to it! This is the way the tempter knows to take The struggling souls of men,‚Äîholds forth to the eye Some glittering bauble, which secured by blood, Turns straight to dross, leaving the longing wretch Without the gain he sinned for, and his soul Stained ineffaceably. I swear by the saints I never nursed a wish for this sad gift Of power which weighs me down, I knew too well Envy's sharp tooth, the deep anxieties Which round the ruler's head set piercing thorns, As sharp as Calvary's. I do affirm I never aimed at power, yet did consent To do what led me to it, since I knew That Aplaces enthroned would ruin Rome! I am innocent of that, but am I guiltless Of blood? Nay, that I am not! Oh, my God! When the loud anthems echoed through the dome Of St. Sophia's, through the throng of priests The rolling perfumed clouds, the kneeling people, I saw my dream, which was a dream no more, But mournful truth. My comrade Aplaces Betrayed through me! I heard a ghastly voice Out-ringing all the music, crying, ‚ÄúTreason!‚Äù And who then was the traitor? Was it I? Nay, nay, I never willed it. Was it Michael? My friend from boyhood? Nay, what has he gained? Nothing! While I have reaped a crown, am C√¶sar, And rule the fate of Rome. Gain, did I say? Oh, would that I might sleep unbroken sleep, As then I did, ere this sad load of sin Lay heavy on my soul, making life anxious And full of boding fears. One little week Has passed, no more, the fierce Bulgarian still Is at our gates, flushed with the mis-won triumph Which treachery has gained him. How shall I, I, a poor wretch, whose conscience makes him coward, Lead Rome against the foe? I cannot do it. The ghosts of Aplaces and his dead soldiers, Slain by no fault but mine, forbid it. Michael May know some politic art to save the city; I'll summon him. Without, there! Summon hither Michael the Amorian. Though his enemies Denounce his crafty temper, yet I know him, A friend of ancient times, and though he shares With me the guilt of murdered Aplaces, I do believe it was his noble hate Of priestcraft and corrupt idolatries Which did mislead him. Who am I to accuse His treason?‚ÄîI, who profit by his sin, Who have gained all he might? Enter Michael, with low obeisance. Nay, Michael, kneel not, We are old comrades. Mich. Nay, most puissant C√¶sar, I am a soldier only, and do kneel Where fealty is due. Leo. Rise! I ennoble thee, Patrician of Rome! Mich. C√¶sar, I thank thee For this unhoped-for honour, and I swear To be thy servant, always. Leo. Nay, good Michael, I would not have thee servant, only friend, As of old time. Mich. Leo, my inmost soul Is touched with gratitude to thee and thine. Command me to what service thou desirest, To the cost of life I'll do it. Leo. I know well How fertile in resource thou art, how grave Our present peril looms. The fierce Bulgarian, Thanks to our grievous error, presses hard Upon our city itself. Mich. Leo, 'tis true The enemy press on us, thousands strong, From the Blachernian to the Golden Gate, And like the Goth and Hun of older Rome, Are thundering at our doors. Leo. And can we meet them And drive them hence? Mich. Nay, that indeed we cannot, The spirit of our men is for the present So crushed by sharp defeat; a score Bulgarians Would rout the arms of Rome. Leo. Then are we ruined And sunk beyond recall. Mich. I said not so. There are other means than arms to drive them hence. They dare not press us further, their rough warriors Are anxious for their homes‚Äîthere comes some sickness, Which on their ill-fed levies falling, widens The gaps which war has made. I do believe That they would rise to any painted lure That Rome might set before them. Leo. Any lure! Would'st have us break our word? Mich. Nay, we would meet them And settle terms of peace. Leo. Ay, that were well, The Empire must have peace to recreate Its wasted strength, which never had been broken But for our act. Mich. Nay, nay, my gracious lord. It was foredoomed to fall and rise again To nobler heights. Leo. Michael, I would that this Were as thou sayest; but what terms of peace Would these Bulgarian rebels, flushed with triumph, Accept of weakling Rome? Mich. It matters little. All would be well. Be sure the Conference Would fix good terms for Rome. Leo. The Conference? How mean you? Mich. That an embassy go hence To the Bulgarian camp, and do propose An armistice. Upon the Roman side The Emperor and half a score of magnates, While the Bulgarian King and nobles meet us With like equipment, in some neutral place And settle terms. Leo. But will they give us terms? Mich. I do not know indeed; but if they do not We have no force to make them. Leo. If they will not? Mich. Then Rome is ruined. What then shall we do? There is no course but one, and that I know not If thou wilt take; but were I in thy stead, Master of Rome, it were not long in doubt. Leo. What would you have? Mich. I hold all means are lawful Against these robbers who invade our peace, Whom now an undeserved good fortune makes Masters of Rome. Think, Leo, think, I pray you! What bloody insults, and unmeasured rapine Your peaceful people, all unused to war, Are suffering at your doors, what if they force Our gates and carry death and cruel outrage To our uncounted myriads, and Rome sinks In a pit of blood and fire, and thou should'st die, Last of the C√¶sars! Leo. Nay, it must not be. 'Tis from our fault it comes. It must not be. Nay, nay, it must not be. Mich. Then have thou courage. There is one way alone. When these Bulgarians. Meet us, as I have said, their King and nobles. Amongst them, thou knowest well in that rude people The King and Chiefs are, brain and sinew and arm, Without which they are nought. Leo. Thou speak'st in riddles; What would'st thou? Mich. This! The King and chiefs are all; The people without these are scattered sheep. Take measures then, when this convention ends, Let their strength end with it. Leo. Michael, I know not Even now what thou would'st do. Mich. I would set upon them And kill them to a man! Leo (drawing his sword). Thou most deceitful And traitorous of men! Would'st have me stain My honour thus. Quick, draw, defend thyself, Ere my sword pierce thee through. Mich. Nay, kill me, C√¶sar, So I save Rome. Leo. Treachery! Treason! Murder! What warps thy nature thus? Mich. What do I gain If I am traitor? 'Tis for Rome alone, Not for myself. Can others say the same Who have gained all‚ÄîI nought? Leo. That we have erred I know, but never did I dream our error Would thus imperil Rome. I trusted thee When thou saidst Aplaces was the Priests' creature. I compassed not his death, but his disgrace; But now I know how great a sin it is To swerve from duty. Mich. Then 'tis pity truly Thou didst not sift my tale, for this is sure, I was misled in thinking Aplaces Was the Priests' creature. Leo. Oh, perfidious wretch, Is my soul stained for this? Mich. Howe'er it be, At least 'tis by our fault Rome lies in peril, And ours it is to save her. Would'st redress Thy wrong? The way lies open. Leo. Leave my presence. Thy words dishonour me. Mich. Ay, but remember One way there is to save Rome, that I show thee. There is no other. If the fate of Rome Move thee not, nor thy own, I pray you ponder What fate awaits our innocent citizens. What thy loved wife and children, if the fierce Bulgarians sack thy palace, or some soldier, Less full of brain-sick scruples, seize thy crown And beat the foeman back. Thou knowest our manners. Would'st have thy boys unmanned and thy young daughters Cribbed in a life-long cloister, and their mother A household drudge, or pining, poor and exiled? Wilt thou not save thy loved ones and thy country? Leo (hiding his face). There is no other way! Help me, oh God! SCENE II. ‚ÄîThe Empress. A Room in the Palace. Empress. I would I were a soldier's wife again, Far from these palace-splendours and the pomp Of heralds and the load of ceremony That weighs down C√¶sar's wife, for when we lived In modest state, my husband, with each night Slept dreamless sleep, but now, good though he is And full of care for others, the long hours Creep slowly to the dawn, and I can hear His wakeful sighs, and see his face with day More haggard than before. I think he is Too noble for a throne, too touched with ruth For this sad world's sad burden, too much filled With thoughts of heaven for earthly happiness. A saint, a martyr, yet even this, methinks, Fails to explain his secret, or the weight Of deep despondency which presses down His spotless soul, nor yet our perilous case Fronting the foe, who thunder at our gates Since the brave Aplaces fell. To-day there goes An embassy to meet the arrogant foe, And yet he throws not off his load. Heaven send, 'Twas no foreboding fear of treachery From these barbarian levies, that oppressed His spotless soul. I weary for his coming; He is too good for men, and yet I know I could not love him, were his soul less free From earthly taint. But here I see there comes A kindred soul to his; a faithful comrade, Michael the Amorian, whom he hath ennobled. (How short a time it seems‚Äîthey were my suitors, And Leo won.) I will inquire of him How goes the embassy. Enter Michael. My Lord Patrician, I give you welcome. It is long years since we met Mich. Illustrious lady, at your feet I kneel as I knelt once when we were young. I am your servant still. Emp. Rise, sir, I pray you, For you are, by the Emperor's grace, remember, Ennobled now. Mich. Nay, Madam, to the woman I kneel, and not the Empress, and should kneel Were I the Emperor's self. Emp. My lord, a truce To courtesies. I know you love my husband; Have you good news of him? He went to-day To the Bulgarian camp with all his Court To settle terms of peace. Will he succeed? Will he save Rome? These foemen press so near Our close beleaguered city, that I know not If aught but failure waits him. For a wife The safety of the State is much indeed, But her lord's safety more. I do not know But sometimes I have thought some secret load Weighs on him, which not all the cares of State Could lay on him or take from him. Dost know What fortune has in store? Mich. Illustrious lady, I cannot doubt his triumph, he has taken Such means to capture fortune, that she lies A prisoner in his toils. Emp. But comes there not Some doubt to give you pause? Mich. Nay, how to doubt? We are too subtle for these blustering braggarts, And subtlety is power. Emp. My lord, you err. My husband is as ever, brave and true, But simple as a child. Mich. Ay, so he was, But statecraft grows with need, till the rude soldier Grows cunning as a Priest. Emp. My husband cunning! There breathes no purer spirit. Mich. Ay, dear lady, There thou art right, But not the less his statecraft, For I have known his purpose, will commend His wisdom when 'tis known. I do approve His daring project. I would keep no faith With the enemies of Rome. Emp. Leo break faith? What mean your words, sir? Mich. Nay, there is no faith Where is not freedom. These Bulgarian robbers Invade our borders, sack our cities, lead Our citizens the citizens of Rome‚Äî To slavery. By some mad stroke of fortune, They rout our bravest General and press Close on our homes. What honourable peace Can come from such? The Emperor goes forth To treat, Taking his life as in his hands. Were it not well to trim the balance thus That if they will not do the right they should, Rome should be safe? Emp. I do not grasp your thought. Mich. Nay, it is this. If the Bulgarian hosts Retire within their borders it is well, But if they will not, then the Emperor Has taken measures that the King and Chiefs Shall trouble us no more. Emp. What, in fair fight? Mich. Yes, fair, since any fight is fair which meets Such villainy as theirs. May be indeed It is a new device, and, truth to tell, My clumsy soldier-wit had ne'er devised it, Or, if it had, had shrunk from it. But now 'Tis too late to turn back. Ask me no more. The Emperor is doubtless safe and Rome, And all our foemen scattered. 'Tis enough; He will be back to-morrow. [Exit Michael. Emp. I would rather Beg bread from door to door, see my loved children In rags, than that my love should soil his honour Even for Imperial Rome! Enter Leo in confusion and haste. Emp. My love, what ails thee? Leo. Defeat‚Äîdisgrace, Dishonour. Touch me not, I am not fit To look upon thy face. They did persuade me To that I knew was wrong, and now I come With hands unstained indeed, but a stained heart. Keep from me, wife. Emp. What is it that has been? Hast thou then broken faith? Leo. Ay, that I have. And nothing but the accident of fortune Saved the Bulgarian King and all his Court. Emp. From massacre? My love, I cannot bear it To think thee false. What is it that has been? Leo. Wife, it is this. Some one‚ÄîI say not who‚Äî False friend, far worse than enemy, o'erbore My will and did persuade me by an ambush To take the enemy. A sudden onset Broke on our conference. The King and Court Took horse and fled, and then, returning, chased me Even to the walls, and now they sack and burn The palaces without and all the churches. St. Mamas' reeks with blood‚Äîthe citizens Are taken in slavery, and we are helpless, And presently the fierce Bulgarian levies Will sit down at our gates and we shall starve Like rats in a cage. Wife, I have sinned in vain, My soul and Rome are lost. Emp. I know not yet Thy meaning as I would, but oh, my love, If thou hast sinned indeed, full well I know It was not for thyself. Leo. Ay, that it was not. But not the less I sinned. The blood I shed not But would have shed by treachery, cries out Not less aloud to Heaven. Emp. If thou hast erred Thou hast not erred alone‚Äîthy comrade Michael Approves thy fault. Leo. What, did he speak of it, The villain? Emp. Ay, he did indeed, and dared Defend thy honour‚Äîfor the secret plan He praised but might not tell me. But my love, Rejoice that thou hast failed. Surely 'twas Heaven Hindered thy sin's fulfilment and would keep thee Guiltless of blood. Repent, my soul! Bethink thee, Dishonour is not statecraft, victory Can wound more deep than failure if it come Divorced from right! 'Tis wrong to do for others That which for self dishonours. But remember, I love thee still, and know thee as thou art, Whate'er the world may deem. Leo. Thou perfect woman, I kneel before thy truth. Emp. Nay, dearest, rather Brace high thy heart and soul‚Äîmeet in fair fight These barbarous foemen, and, if Heaven will have it, Conquer, and save thy Empire, and forget Thy sin, which was not done, as Heaven forgets it. Rouse thyself! Be a C√¶sar as thou wert, And save our Rome again! Leo. Dear wife, thy word Breathes life. I will obey. The Emperor Forgets his sin, and will go forth undaunted To battle for his people. The fond husband Loves deeper than before. The stain√©d soul With penance and with vigils, will lay bare Its mortal sin to Heaven. Emp. My heart! My love!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. ‚ÄîA Room in the Palace. The Empress; afterwards Michael. Emp. How slowly comes the dawn to watching eyes! How goes the fight? Last night as midnight struck My husband and his army issued forth, From out the western gates, hoping to take The foemen unawares, and now the morning Has come and brought no news, only a glare Of fire upon the sky and shouts and cries Of victory and pain, but nothing certain Has reached the city. Oh that I might see My love again unharmed. But as I hope, Whether untouched he come or wounded sore, He will have cast from him the weary load Which weighed upon his soul. To have him thus Were happiness enough. Enter Servant. Ser. My gracious liege, There comes a Captain from the field who brings Good news. Emp. Let him appear. Enter Captain. Cap. My liege, I bring Good tidings. The Bulgarian force has fled Before the Emperor, in shameful rout With dreadful slaughter. Our victorious forces Chase them in hot pursuit. The Emperor Returns ere long, letting his Generals Deal with the wretches, and will soon give thanks At St. Sophia's. Emp. God be praised for this. Heaven has forgiven his sin. Enter Michael. Mich. Good news, dear lady, For Rome and for thyself. The Emperor Is safe and cometh soon. Ah, happy man Whom a fond wife and gracious children wait To smooth his careworn brow. Such precious fate Might have been mine long since, but adverse fortune Blighted my hope. Emp. My lord, I well remember Thy fealty and do thank thee, but young love Is tyrannous and drives out all besides; Let us be friends. Mich. Nay, never, lady! Never! Or less or more. Emp. You do forget yourself, And what a loyal friend and subject owes His Sovereign and his friend. Mich. Ah, friend no more, But loyal subject still. Emp. Why not his friend? Tho' I remember well on that sad day Of our defeat he spoke impatient words Of thee and thy design. Mich. Me?‚ÄîMy design? Art jesting, lady? Emp. Sir, 'tis solemn truth. Mich. He had no cause But I have much. I could record a tale Of treachery which would make thy cheek grow pale, Dared I to give thee pain. Emp. Whose treachery; My husband's? Mich. Ay, good lady, and no other's. Emp. I do disdain to hear. Nay, sir, say on What have your lips to say against a man The noblest I have known? Mich. You know his trouble; You know his careworn visage‚Äîhis confession Of sin, his sleepless nights‚Äîhis load of sorrow. Emp. Nay, Heaven! 'tis true He did confess it, though I grasped it not. Something hath been of which it doth repent him, And I have marked his pain; but know he was The tempted, not the tempter. Is't not so, Michael? I do conjure thee by the love You bore me once, tell me by all the saints What is it that has been? Mich. I can but answer. Such words are a command. What would you know? Emp. The cause of his unrest. Mich. Oh, awful power Of conscience which doth rack the sinful head Beneath the Imperial Crown! I cannot do it. Have me excused. Emp. Nay, sir, I am your Sovereign. Mich. Have I your word to keep all undivulged? Emp. The Empress breaks not faith. Mich. Madam, your husband Betrayed his comrade Aplaces to death With all his men, at the great fight, and wherefore? That he might reign, and you. When at the gates The fierce Bulgarian raged, and all his sin Seemed fruitless, he devised a crafty plot By which our men should at a given signal Fall on the King and all his train. I prayed him By all our ancient friendship, by the love I bore you while I might, to keep his soul Unstained, by such gross sin. Better defeat, Disgrace, a ruined Empire, prison, exile, Nay death, than such dishonour. But he listened As one who hears not‚Äîwent his way, and failed, As he deserved. Emp. Oh, it is true! all true! And is this treacherous wretch my love, my dear, My spotless martyr? Mich. Spotless martyr, say you? Nay, murderer in act and thought, imbued With floods of innocent blood! Emp. Ah, Heaven! his sorrow! Must I believe this thing? Mich. Nay, heed not, lady. He comes to lay his prize of victory Upon the altar, and there is no voice To say a conqueror nay. Emp. But I will say it. I will not live a day with such a traitor. Good Michael! Well I know thou lov'st me well. Advise me! I am wretched, and my head Abhors this bloodstained crown. Nay, I will fly Before he cometh. Mich. Thou should'st fly with me But that thy delicate faith and troth forbid thee, But bear awhile to know his villainy; Speaking no word, it may be Providence Will pity thee and send thee swift relief. Heaven pity thee, my love! Emp. Nay, sir, remember, Such words dishonour me. Mich. Farewell! Farewell! SCENE II. ‚ÄîA Street in Byzantium. Citizens. 1st Citizen. Well, I never thought to feel happy again after that miserable winter with the Bulgarians clamouring at our gates and the whole suburb of St. Mamas' in flames. Do you remember that dreadful night, when the Emperor and his retinue only just escaped from the Conference by riding hard, and just as they gained the Golden Gate and safety, the enemy's horse were upon their rear? 2nd Cit. What were the rights of that matter, Citizen? I suppose those rascally Barbarians thought to catch C√¶sar in one of their detestable ambuscades, and were not quick enough. What a treacherous hateful crew! It is useless to keep faith with such cowards. 1st Cit. Oh, quite out of the question, in fact, false villains. 3rd Cit. No doubt; but are you quite sure of your facts? I know a soldier of the Guard, and he told me, under strict promise of secrecy, that it was the Emperor who set the ambuscade for the Bulgarians; not they for him. 2nd Cit. I don't believe it; that conscientious creature, that mass of principle and scruples, that half priest half soldier, do such a thing, not he! 3rd Cit. Don't believe it, indeed! Why, what is the great harm of ridding yourself of a perfidious enemy by paying him back in his own coin? Not the least, say I, and you have only to succeed to be right. 1st Cit. Well then, the Emperor is in the right now. He did not manage to kill the King of Bulgaria in ambush, but just as he was sitting down before Constantinople he dies, as good fortune would have it, and then the rest was easy. The Emperor made a sally last night; the enemy, already sick, were surprised and routed, and now there is not a Bulgarian within fifty miles, and their country is ravaged, half their army lies buried on the spot under the Mount of Leo, there is a truce for thirty years, and there will be a fine thanksgiving to-day at St. Sophia's. 2nd Cit. Well, all's well that ends well. But I think there must have been something in the soldier's story too‚Äîfor from that time to this, Leo has been desponding, and praying in his private chapel far into the night and before daybreak. Why, the chapel choir have been summoned to sing Kyrie Eleison so often that the first tenor's voice is worn as thin as a reed. 3rd Cit. Well, if it fails the Emperor can replace him. I am told he has the most powerful baritone in all Constantinople, and he has no greater pleasure than singing the chants. 1st Cit. Then, depend upon it, the story is true. He has something to repent of, no doubt, and it cannot be any common-place sin, because he is as sober as an anchorite and a good deal chaster than a hermit. 2nd Cit. But how did he come to consent to the strong measures against the Bulgarians, if your story be true. 3rd Cit. Well, I will tell you. I believe it was the Patrician Michael, the Amorian, who persuaded him for his own purpose. I believe he knows too much, and Leo has to obey him willy-nilly. They have been comrades, remember. What was it led to the defeat and death of John Aplaces? I have no doubt Michael could tell you an he would. Who ennobled him? There is not a greater scoundrel among the Patricians, and that is saying a good deal. 1st Cit. I dare say you are right, Citizen. All the more reason for rejoicing that the Emperor is himself again. Life would not be worth having under Michael the Amorian, and if I were the Emperor I would make him impossible without loss of time. 3rd Cit. Oh fie, Citizen. I am afraid a barbarian might, if he heard you, think our people less scrupulous than, thanks to the saints! they are. 1st Cit. Well, it is certain he never goes to the palace, and the old friendship is broken off. He is a dangerous enemy, with no sense of gratitude, and owes Leo a grudge for supplanting him with his old love the Empress. He will begin plotting presently, you will see. Well, sufficient for the day, etc. At last, after so many years, our empire is secure, peace is ensured, and if it were not for the rascally Priests and the equally rascally Iconoclasts, honest men like you and I might have nothing to do but enjoy ourselves and make love to our wives. 3rd Cit. Or to other peoples'? Well, it is about time for the procession to St. Sophia's. I hear the music in the distance. [Exeunt. SCENE III. ‚ÄîBefore St. Sophia's. Leo. Surely my soul is shriven of its guilt, Since Heaven smiles on me now, I am again Victorious as of old, ere my great sin A few short months ago blighted my life. Oh, Aplaces, my comrade Aplaces! Would thou wert with us now to bear the crown Which I would gladly yield thee; for indeed It was not power I longed for, but to keep Unstained the faith of Christ. For the deceit Which would have ta'en the foemen in the toils, I know 'twas wicked now, but pitying Heaven, Knowing I sinned for others, not myself, Soiled not my soul with act. I rule indeed In plenitude of power, and on the altar I lay my purified and grateful heart An offering, and will swear an oath to rule With justice to each humblest citizen. And knowing war too well will cherish Peace, And keep the simple faith of Christ unstained By gross idolatries. I sit in the seat Of Antonine and Constantine, and strive To make my people happy. But I see not The Empress and my children. Where are they? Servant. Her Majesty is well, But humbly prays you Have her excused, who when the thanksgiving Is done will wait on you. Enter Archbishop, and Priests with Acolytes in procession. Leo. Then must I go Alone, as is my fate. Lead on, my lords, I would give thanks to God. [Procession disappears within the church to chanting music. Empress bursting in. Emp. Will God forgive The hypocrite who lays a bloodstained hand Upon His sacred altar?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. (An Interval of Seven Years.) SCENE I. ‚ÄîA Street in Byzantium. The Patriarch and Priests, Theodore of Studium, and Monks. The Patriarch. Good sirs, how think you? Hath not his Majesty a right to order, If I your Patriarch have not, that the monks Should bear no more the sacred ikons forth Along the streets for worship, and forbid That any in God's House should bow the knee To statue or to picture, or to aught Save only the invisible Spirit that dwells Upon His altar? Theodore. Lord Theodotus, The usage of the Church is stronger far Than any word of man. The Church of Christ Hath in all times since first she built the faith Fired thus her worshippers, by reverence For symbols of the Unseen. Pat. Idolaters Are all who do this thing! Theo. Idolaters! Not them we worship, but the Deity, Formless itself, which fills them. Holy Father, I pray you ask not this obedience. Pat. Son, By C√¶sar's will and by my holy office I do inhibit thee from such rebellion As thou dost meditate. Wilt thou obey And swear allegiance, then thou art forgiven; If thou wilt not, I have the Imperial mandate To banish thee from Rome. Theo. Then will I go. I will hold fast the faith and all it teaches, Whatever doom awaits me. Pat. Guards, arrest him; I have the Emperor's commands. Tonight He sails for Asia. Monks. Nay, nay; he shall not go! Down with the tyrant! [Clamour from Monks; Guards press them back and arrest Theodore. Patriarch and Monks exeunt. 1st Priest. Let him rot in exile, I care not‚Äîgross, idolatrous knave; but think you C√¶sar is true? What think you I have heard? He did entreat our Patriarch to be All things to all. The pictures and the ikons He bids him not expel, but place them high Upon the walls, so that the ignorant Kneel not to them, but Heaven. A fig, say I, For such half-hearted, feeble compromise! If it is wrong to worship them, 'tis wrong To tempt the weakling soul. Oh, for a man With a man's strength, to rule like that brave noble Michael the Amorian, an iconoclast In heart and hand alike! 2nd Pr. Who told you this? 1st Pr. It came from Michael's lips. 2nd Pr. Well, he knows best. But can you trust his word? 1st Pr. Ay, that we can, When it suits his purpose. 2nd Pr. As it does, no doubt, To pull down C√¶sar's pride. Well, breathe no word, But keep the faith, and pray its champion Come to his own in time. [Exeunt. Enter Courtiers. 1st Courtier. A plague, I say, on this Armenian upstart, Who, stammering his bastard Greek, would bring The Empire to disgrace. There is no judge But goes in fear of him and of his cant Of equal justice, threatening honest suitors If they would show them grateful. 2nd Court. Ay, 'tis true We have fallen on evil times; the revenue Which flowed so carelessly of old, he pares With parsimonious meanness‚Äîsuch regard For the complaining villein that it boots not To be his officer. Officer. His faithful army Knows a worse lot. Such pitiless discipline He holds, the saintly bigot, not a soldier, Whatever his rank or age, but seems to pine Under his prying eye. Court. Would he were dead! We want a C√¶sar, as of old, as was The Michael we have lost. Officer. Ay, that we do, And there is one to hand, alike in name, Michael the Amorian; strong in noble manhood, No dreamer of thin dreams, but a strong arm Which can sustain the right. See, here he comes! Welcome, my lord. Have you heard how the people Rise in revolt, how passionate mobs beset The Palace; how the mutinous Guards insult The Sacred Image on the gate, or how The Abbot, Theodore, among his monks Carries the holy pictures down the streets Through kneeling crowds. Mich. Nay, nay, too well I know The shameful tale! Would that our Rome once more Knew a strong ruler as of yore! But why Thus wish in vain? 1st Court. 'Tis not in vain, my lord. You are not alone. Mich. Alone, in what, I pray you? In thought, say you, or deed? 1st Court. Alone in neither. You have many friends. Mich. Ay, that I hope indeed. But how should friendship cure the pressing ills Which do infest the State? Court. My lord, I tell you, And I do speak for all and thousands else Who think with us; if thou should'st speak the word, Rome might be thine to-morrow. Mich. Ah, friends, good friends! Breathe not such thoughts, I pray; the Emperor Has been my life-long comrade; to his bounty I owe my noble rank, and if sometimes I have deplored the errors which have led him To acted crime, yet have I thought them sprung From the head, not from the heart. Yet crimes they are, Unworthy C√¶sar‚Äîtreasons, stratagems, Murders most foul. Court. Nay, my lord, speak more plainly. We did know much, but these‚Äî Mich. Ask not of them. My lips are sealed. Court. Nay, but your duty bids you What friendship would forbid. Mich. Ay, is it so? Then must I speak. Oh Heaven, the Emperor Betrayed to death the stainless Aplaces And thousands with him, that he might ascend His bloodstained throne. When he was seated on it He sought to slay the fierce Bulgarian King In treacherous ambush at the Conference And all his train, and since unmerited Fortune Has given him victory, he seeks to harass All precious things alike; religion, justice, The honour of our armies. It is time To end this tragedy, and if you will, I pledge to you my life. Court. My lord, we all Will stand by you; we will be free once more. Give but the word, and all who hear you now Will die for you at need. Mich. Good friends, I thank you, If it must be, it must. Let it be soon. Approach the soldiers! Raise the Citizens! Spread on all sides what you have learned to-day, And before long, grant Heaven, this tyranny Lies shattered on the ground, and you shall choose Some worthier ruler, not myself, who am Too weak for higher duty than to live The servant of our Rome. Court. Nay, thou alone Canst save us, Michael. Mich. Citizens, I pray you Breathe not a word, but let us meet together In secret, this day se'nnight‚Äîhaving fixed How best to gain success. Now let us go, This concourse may betray us. Court. Noble Michael, We are all thine. [Exeunt. Mich. Fools, knaves, and dullards all! Too easy conquest; tho' it suits my purpose To cozen you, i' faith 'tis weary work. There is not one among you fit to tie The Emperor's latchet. Knaves! when my turn comes I'll deal with you. SCENE II. ‚ÄîA Room in the Palace. The Empress and her Lady. Empress. Good Helena, I am weary, yet I know Sleep will not come to me, if I should seek it. These rumours of dark plots, and stratagems Forbid me rest. The Emperor, my husband, Comes not, so heavy lies the load of care Upon the Imperial brow. Helena. Your Majesty, Would you that I should sing to you and lull Your sleepless care to rest? Emp. Nay, Helena, Music speaks comfort to harmonious souls, But not to those racked with discordant cares, As mine is now. But come! I know thy skill. Sing me some sweet, sad song. [Helena. sings. ‚ÄúWhat shall bring solace to the heart Whose hope lies dead? What anodyne shall dull life's smart When Faith has fled? Oh Love, relight thy torch and reillume, Divine Magician, the encircling gloom! ‚ÄúForlorn our footsteps stray in vain Thro' darkling night. Desponding, anxious, full of pain, Shine, sacred light! Dispel the glooms of doubt, until the Sun Of Faith mounts high and all our cares are done.‚Äù [Emp.] I thank thee, dear, 'Tis a sweet, sad song. Hel. Nay, wherefore, gracious mistress, Are you thus anxious, since your enemies Are fallen into the toils; the Amorian pines, Loaded with chains, in prison, and with him all The vile conspiring crew. Emp. Oh, Helena! Can I rejoice because these hapless men Are taken, and go forth to die with tortures Because they did conspire? Hel. The Emperor Were else undone and you‚Äîsure it is justice that dooms them. Emp. Nay, good Helena, a throne Gained by unworthy means, treachery, bloodshed, Breeds like offence in others. Hel. Gracious lady! When did the Emperor shed blood of any? That saintly man! Emp. Nay, Helena, forget My hasty words‚ÄîI am unhinged to-night And miserable, and know not what I say; This loneliness and brooding thought o'erset My feeble spirit. Hel. I would the Emperor Might come to comfort you. Emp. Nay, nay, indeed I would not, for I shrink from sight of him. Long years we live apart from bed and board; 'Tis long since I have seen him, for there comes A bar between our souls. Hel. My gracious mistress, Surely this is but phantasy; your spouse Is faithful to your bed, husband and father Without a spot of blame. For policy He is the soul of justice, not a subject But knows it well. Emp. Ay! But were this the cloak Of vile hypocrisy? What then? What say'st thou If it were proved that every step he trod To his throne was through deceit; if every jewel In the proud crown he wears was bought with blood And treachery; if now he purchases His safety with the freedom and the lives Of those who would have saved him from the crimes Which, unrepented, damn him? Helena! I cannot doubt this horror. Michael, A pure and noble soul, with much reluctance Discovered all, and since that day I know not Comfort, or sleep, or peace. Hel. Dost know him well? Emp. Ay, for I loved him once, And he‚Äîhe loves me still. Hel. Dared he declare His lawless love? Emp. 'Twas his great passion broke, Despite him, into utterance, and I pitied His loveless life; I whom kind Heaven had blest With love requited, till I forced from him The tale of Leo's guilt. Nay, Helena, His is a stainless soul. Hel. By Heaven, it is not, But a deceiver's and a villain's‚Äîtraitor And murderer at heart! Emp. What proof have you Of these wild whirling words, for without proof I will not hold him false? Hel. Oh, how to free A woman self-enchained! Listen, dear Mistress, There is no other way. I needs must speak, Though the words blight my life. Dear lady, heed not His glozing words. I too have loved this man, And he betrayed me. See, he is a villain! There is no lie too vile for him, no action Too treacherous, no stain of blood so deep But he would soil his soul with it to gain The pettiest end. Emp. Nay, Helena, I loved him, 'Tis long ago, yet cannot hear such things Even now unmoved. Hel. Hast thou not spoken of it To the Emperor? Emp. Nay, I could not. Hel. Ah, dear lady, Love mates not with unfaith. Oh, tell him all. I hear without the trumpets which announce His coming. Tell him all that Michael told thee, And trust thy love again. [Exit. Enter Leo. Leo. Wife, is it well with thee? 'Tis long, meseems, Since thou and I have been as we were once, One heart, one soul, some secret chilling doubt Comes 'twixt our lives, not mine, for I am still Thy lover as of old; but thou hast ta'en Some deep distrust, 'twould seem. What is't, my heart? Emp. Nay, nay, my lord, nothing but what thyself Knows best. Leo. Nay, that indeed I do not. Tell me. Thou art not jealous? Emp. Nay, indeed, my lord, My grief is more than that; of that unfaith I never did suspect thee. Leo. Ay, I thought not. What is it, then? Let us not live asunder. It may be in a time of treacheries, And plots, and murders,‚Äîit may be our fate To die together. Emp. Treacheries! murders! say you Thus glibly off the tongue? Hast thou no fear To use them? Leo. Nay, that have I not, nor fear To punish them when found. Emp. Even in thyself? Deep hidden within thy soul? Leo. Not in myself! I mete no other measure to myself Than that I give to others. Emp. Oh! my husband, Be not deceiv√®d thus! Leo. Nay, wife, what is it? Emp. Is thy soul free from stain for Aplaces? Leo. Alas, 'tis not indeed, my days, my nights Are full of him, and every trivial hour Has threescore tongues which whisper, ‚ÄúAplaces,‚Äù Nought else, and shall till death. Emp. Then art thou guilty! It was as they have told me, and 'tis true Thou did'st betray thy comrade‚Äîthat thyself Might grasp the crown. Leo. Nay, nay, I did it fearing He should betray the faith of Christ, no more. Heaven be my witness. Emp. But thou did'st betray him, And Rome with him? Leo. Nay, nay! Not willingly. I strove to give my life for him, but found It was too late, our Roman legions routed, And my dear comrade slain, and for a lie Forged by a villain. Emp. Dear, I do rejoice That 'twas not as I feared. But that sad plot Against the hostile King? Leo. Heaven has forgiven The sin I did not. The same serpent-voice That tempted to betray my comrade, urging That I should keep the Faith unblemished, bade me For thee and for our children's honour, freedom, Nay, life itself, accept the crafty scheme Which, I praise Heaven, failed. Emp. For me and mine! Was it for us thou sinned'st! My love! My life! My martyr once again! My paragon! Stainless no longer, but more lovable Even for thy fault‚Äîforgive me that I doubted Thy precious truth. Before thee I would kneel As to my lord. Leo. Nay, wife, thou art forgiven. 'Tis a sad world. But who was it betrayed My fault to thee? Emp. Thy friend, whom once I loved, Michael the Amorian. Leo. God! how base is man! 'Twas he who did persuade me to offend By subtle argument, which, reinforced By my great love, misled me. Emp. The base wretch! That I should once have loved so black a soul! He should be punished. Leo. Nay, his punishment Should rest with Heaven, but now his treacheries And murderous intrigues, being discovered, He lies in prison, and to-day the judges Have sentenced him to die. Poor wretch, I would That I might spare his life and banish him, For we were boys together. Emp. Good, my lord, What is his sentence? Leo. 'Tis to die to-morrow In boiling oil. 'Tis the law speaks, remember, Not I. Emp. And is't to-morrow? Dost thou mind What day it is? The birthday of our Lord. The brightest day in the revolving year, Vowed to high revelry and innocent mirth, Because the world is saved. Leo. Ay, so it is. But the law dooms him, and I dare not set My will above it. Emp. Leo, thou art C√¶sar. Thy will is law. I pray you think a moment What thing thou dost. If thy great clemency Pardon him not; yet, oh, I prithee, stain not This holy day with blood. Leo. Thou dost not know, As I, how grave his plot, how great a danger, I speak not of ourselves, but for the State, Comes from delay. Nay, nay, I dare not do it. Let the law take its course. Emp. Leo, I pray you Listen to me this once. To-morrow's dawn Will see thee in the church, bearing your part In chanted hymns,‚Äîto-morrow thou wilt take The solemn Eucharist, while in his cell The comrade of thy boyhood writhes in torture And his cries shock thy ears. 'Twere mortal sin To do this thing! Leo. Good wife, thou can'st not know The peril, but because thou takest care For my soul's welfare only‚Äîlet it be Even as thou wilt. I will bid the officer Bring to me ere I sleep the master-key Of Michael's fetters. For thy tender heart, I pray it bring not swift calamity On thee, and on our children. [Exeunt. SCENE III. ‚ÄîMichael's Dungeon. Michael in chains, and Gaoler; afterwards Leo. Mich. Good sir, I pray you pity me, and ease These galling chains a little. It is late, And I shall die with morning. Of your kindness‚Äî And I have much to thank you for‚ÄîI pray you Let me rest now. It is the last request That I shall make on earth. Gao. My lord, my duty Compels me that I guard thee, but indeed I grieve to see thee here in this sad cell Which opens on the grave. Mich. They call me traitor. But I was never traitor to my country, Nor sold her, as did some. Gao. Nay, that, my lord, I am sure thou didst not. Noble Aplaces Was long my leader, and who was it sold him And all his men to death? Not thou, I know. Mich. Sir, thou art right indeed. I loved my comrade With more than woman's love. The power that pens me Within this dungeon's walls, did to his death Drive on that precious life. Who is the traitor? Nay, nay, not I, but Leo. Gao. My good lord, I pity your sad case‚Äîand here are many Who do espouse your fortunes. Mich. Give to them An innocent man's blessing. If your pity Is real, as I think it, let me pass The few hours left me in unfettered rest. Gao. Nay, that I cannot, for the Emperor Carries with him the keys; but on my bed, Softer than is your own, I pray you stretch Your weary limbs, until the signal comes Which bids you wake to die. Good night, my lord, Sleep well till, waking, you shall bid good morning In the new dawn of heaven. Mich. Canst thou condemn An innocent man? My friends, without the walls, Are planning my release. Thou wilt have gold And rank if they succeed. Gao. My lord, I dare not; I care not for my life, but dread to leave My children fatherless. Pray you take rest It may be Heaven will touch the tyrant's heart With clemency. Mich. Sir, it is wasting time To trifle with you. Let me sleep, I pray you. I am dead tired. [Throws himself on Gaoler's bed and falls asleep. Enter Leo. Leo. I cannot sleep. My heart is sore, I dread The morning. 'Tis the mystic eve when all The kine, they say, kneel in their stalls, and sounds Of angel-music fill the starry pole. To-night of all nights in the year shall I Sleep while my comrade spends the waning hours That lie 'twixt him and death? What can I do To spare his life? Gaoler, how fares your prisoner? What! Sleeping on your bed? Hadst thou not charge That he within the straitest cell of doom Should wait the morning? Gao. Good, my lord, forgive me If I have erred in this, for I will answer With my own life for his. Leo. Withdraw awhile, Leave us alone. [Exit Gaoler. Leo. (regarding Michael asleep). He sleeps the dreamless sleep Of an untroubled soul. Great God! how strange Thy judgments show‚Äîfor know I not Thy Word, ‚ÄúFor so He giveth His beloved sleep.‚Äù Dost Thou then love the traitor, who for self Would tread the paths of bloodshed and betray Love, friend, or country? Is not innocence Dearer than guilt to the All-seeing Eye Too pure to look on foulness? Does Thy mercy Open so wide a door, that to the cry Of the repentant heart Thou dost unseal The treasures of Thy grace? And if Thy hand Is pitiful, shall I, who am a wretch, Needing Thy pardon sorely for ill-deeds Acted or thought, forgive not? Michael! Michael! Guilty thou art indeed, but it may be Thou hast found peace. Here is the master-key Of all thy gyves‚Äîwhat should the Emperor Unlock them now, so that thou wake with dawn To freedom, and a word, a sign might open Thy prison doors for thee? Nay, nay, I may not! Would not this plotter, who it seems has gained That simple gaoler to him, and his friends The idolatrous crew, the vile, corrupt oppressors, The needy courtiers and the dregs of the city Flood Rome with blood? Nay, though he shall not die, To-morrow, I will send him, guarded well, To exile. [Chanting of carols heard without. Ah, the sacred music passes. 'Tis Christmas morn, once more. I am rejoiced To hear them once again. I cannot mar This sacred day with blood; peril there is, Great peril, in delay; but I will spend (It may be that I have not long to live) One happy day at least. With early dawn I must to the chapel with the choir and sing My hymns of praise to Heaven. Enter Gaoler. Gaoler, keep safe Your prisoner. It is Christmas-day. God keep you. He came to-day to save. [Exit Leo. Gao. Ah, who would think A tyrant could thus speak! [Michael wakes. Mich. What a strange dream! I dreamt the Emperor looked on me as I slept. Gao. Nay, my lord, truly It was no dream. Mich. What! did he come and see me At rest upon your bed? Gao. Ay, that he did. Mich. Seemed he surprised? Gao. He gave me charge to keep My prisoner safe‚Äîno more, and then I heard him Say in low tones, these words, ‚ÄúPeril there is, Great peril, in delay.‚Äù Mich. Said he no more? Gao. Ay, this, ‚ÄúWith early dawn I must to the chapel with the choir.‚Äù Then went Stealthily as he came. Mich. Then am I nigh Death's gate as ever luckless mortal was, Who yet did breathe and live. I do beseech you Succour a dying man. Fetch a confessor. I cannot die unshriven. Gao. My lord, I go to send him. [Exit Gaoler. Mich. Quick! Now with these fettered hands To write to Theodore and the vile crew Who did conspire with me. ‚ÄúMichael, the Amorian, Dies with the dawn. Therefore lose not a moment. The Emperor in the chapel with the day Singeth the Christmas chants. Take trusty men, Disguised as choristers, and beneath their robes Let them bear arms. If any doubt their man, Let them await until his pealing voice Mounts loftier than the rest. Then let the singer Fall 'neath sure strokes. Remember, if you do not, Michael, at daybreak, purchases his freedom With all your heads!‚Äù Enter Priest. Priest. My poor unhappy son, Wouldst make confession? Mich. Welcome, holy father, I would make my peace with God and with the Church, Whose loving son I am. I have borne no part With those idolatrous dogs, whose vile devices Defile the sanctuary, and therefore only It is I come to die. Priest. My son, the Church Is grateful for thy service, and would give thee, Through my poor hands, her blessing. Therefore, kneel And make confession first. Mich. That will I, father. Yet pardon me if I should dare to make One last request. There are whom once I fear I did offend‚Äîthe Abbot Theodore And other worthy souls. I fain would die At peace with all the world. Would'st thou, good father, For I am prisoned, bear the message to them Which here is written, and to the holy man Give it in his own hands? Priest. My son, I will. Mich. I thank thee, father, and will count the minutes Until thou comest to shrive me. [Exit Priest. Nay, my hour Is not yet come. I shall not die, but live To wear the Imperial Crown!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. ‚ÄîThe Ante-chapel of the Imperial Chapel. Citizens. Distant thunder and lightning. 1st Cit. A Merry Christmas to you, friends. A Merry Christmas. But I do wish that 'twas a fairer morning. It does freeze beyond doubt‚Äîas my fingers tell me, and strange to say at this season there is a great storm coming. Do you hear the thunder? 2nd Cit. If I were not a good son of the Church, nothing would have made me turn out at this hour, and this a holiday, too, when one might have lain warm for hours. But 'tis Christmas-day, and the Emperor is sure to be here presently, and there will be largess when he comes forth, no doubt. 3rd Cit. Well, perhaps it is just as well that it is so cold and dark, else there would have been more of us to share it. 1st Cit. Ay, and there will be some fine music, I promise you. The Emperor himself will sing in the choir. He has a wonderful deep voice, and is as devout as a Priest. 2nd Cit. A good deal more so, Citizen‚Äîbelieve me! But here are more, ready robed for the choir, and muffled up to the eyes. 3rd Cit. Ay; don't you see; they are no doubt those great singers whom Leo has paid handsomely, as he did last year. Well, it is easy to be devout if you have unbounded wealth to draw upon as he has. 1st Cit. They say he has made great preparations this year to have the Christmas service sung more splendidly than ever, because he has been now seven years Emperor, and thinks every year may be his last. 2nd Cit. Well, so it may be, very likely. Some one is sure to want his throne soon. We don't keep our C√¶sars too long as a rule. 3rd Cit. Well, it won't be Michael the Amorian, in any case. That excellent Patrician is in the cells safe enough. 1st Cit. Yes, and will be served up with oil presently. I must go and see that function when the Mass is done. Well, let us go outside and walk about to keep warm. It cannot be colder than it is here. Enter two Conspirators disguised as Choristers. 1st Cons. We are in time‚Äîthey have not arrived yet. We had better pass in at once. Remember, if 'tis too dark to distinguish faces, we may know him, as Lord Michael wrote, easily. We must wait for a fine deep voice‚Äî chanting alone. 2nd Cons. And then? 1st Cons. Then stab him to the heart! 2nd Cons. Agreed! But there must be no hesitation, or half and half work, or our lives and our employers' are not worth an hour's purchase. 1st Cons. I am ready if thou art. Pass on. Where is the holy water? I must make the sign of the cross for luck before I go in! [Exeunt into Chapel. Enter Leo. Leo. The Priests are not yet come, but the hours creep Too slow for sleepless eyes. Here once again, It may be for the last time, I am spared To keep this solemn Christmas. I thank God My hands are free from bloodshed and my soul, For musing, since I left him, on our lives And how we grew together, till some spell Bewitched his honour, I have ta'en resolve To pardon him, who one time was my friend. And therefore 'tis that, with a grateful heart Tuned to high praise, I come this Christmas morn To let my joy and thankfulness to Heaven Rise like a surging fountain. When the Mass Is done, then will I to his cell, and there Unlock his fetters, and will bid him go And plot no more, but turn him to the right, Remembering who was born to-day and came Upon the earth to save. Enter Patriarch and Bishops‚Äî Priests and Choir in procession. Lord Patriarch, I give you a good Christmas. I am ready, My heart is full of praise. [Exit into Chapel. [Procession passes into Choir. Chanting begins. Conspirators concealed behind pillar, listen eagerly. Kyrie Eleison. At length Leo sings alone. When he has finished, they rush forward and attempt to stab him. Confusion. Leo defends himself with cross, snatched up. Struggle. Leo. Villains, would you pollute The sanctuary with blood? See, with the Cross I do confront you. Have you no mercy, wretches? 1st Cons. Nay, 'tis no time for mercy, but for vengeance. Tyrant, take that! [Stabs him. Leo. Oh, I am sped! I am sped! How wonderful Thy judgments are, my God! [Leo falls. Conspirators fly. Enter Empress, Helena veiled, and Children, who throw themselves on their father's breast. Empress. My love, what ails thee? Some presentiment Of evil brought me. Leo. Kiss me, ere I die. I have loved thee long and always. For my sins, I think they are forgiven. Spare their lives Who slew me, they are guilty, but they were Vile instruments at worst. Set Michael free! Let him not die! [Dies. Enter Michael in chains. Michael. Michael will free himself! What! Is he dead? Quick! Take from him the key Which locks these gyves. [Unlocking chains, which fall with a clang. See! I am prisoner No longer, but your Emperor. Remove That dead man's body and give it burial Befitting C√¶sar dead. See you, that woman Goes with her brood to exile! Emp. Thou vile wretch! Thou murderer of the noblest life that flowered From a decaying realm. Listen! I loathe you, I do defy your malice. I, your Sovereign, Despise you. I, whose senseless woman's tongue Snatched you from merited doom, I do denounce you Traitor and perjurer! Mich. Away with them! Their weakness doth protect them. (To Patriarch.) You, my lord, Be sure I will maintain your holy Church And this our State. [A loud clap of thunder and blinding flash of lightning. Confusion. Nay, nay, I am unscathed. Heaven doth approve the strong nor lightly strikes Your Emperor. To-morrow you shall crown me In St. Sophia's. Re-enter Helena, bursting from her Guards, with Citizens. Citizens. Long live our new C√¶sar, Michael the Amorian! Helena. Nay, not long, poor dupes, Nor ever C√¶sar, but a villain doomed By Heaven's own voice. Listen, thou hypocrite And murderer! The woman thou didst wrong Long since and hast forgotten (unveils), though she spared Her base betrayer long, yet will not spare The murderer of her lord, who banishes Her mistress and their orphans. Dost thou think Thy legions, or thy Priests can save thee now? Nay, nay, they shall not, nor the powers of hell. Thy day is done, Traitor and Murderer! Take that, and that, and that! [Stabs him. Michael falls dead by the side of Leo. Patriarch. Just and unjust! Behold the hand of Heaven! To-morrow we will lay them side by side In St. Sophia's. Curtain. A LAST VISION. Oh, wonder! oh, transport! Oh, ecstasy! that fills the purg√®d sight With beams of golden light. And is this then the old familiar Earth, Or a new sphere gained by a second birth? As waking from my cloistered slumbers deep, I spurn the caves of sleep. Oh, wonder surpassing! A hundred suns for one, with constant light, Awake the ethereal air and banish Night; Sleep shrinks abashed, and Sleep's half-sister Death, Nor Time disturbs, nor Age, nor failing breath, While high ineffable rhythms roll around Harmonious waves of sound. Oh, glory! oh, rapture! For lo! the troubles and the toils are past, Done are the chequered years of Earth at last, The wandering footsteps on the unlighted way; Here the new Dawn ushers unfailing Day. Oh, calm effulgence from a cloudless sky! Spirit! is this to die? Oh, marvel! oh, glory! For see once more the lost are here again, Unchanged in aught, yet purged of earthly stain; And lo! the saints, the sages, a white throng Chanting with accents clear the Eternal song, Martyrs of Truth who braved in every age The World's despite and rage. Oh, vision enchanting! Here there is work for all! dutiful, blest, Sweeter and higher far than idle rest, Work that exalts the man above the brute; Laborious days that never fail of fruit; Forces that faint not; brains that never tire; Souls that aspire! aspire! Oh, wonder amazing! Lo! 'tis the self-same world, tho' seeming strange, By some ineffable change, And such transforming radiance grown divine As never on the sad old Earth might shine. And hark, the long-hushed tones of homely love, And lo! the clear calm eyes which looked above. Yea, here or leagues beyond the farthest sun Nor life, nor love are done! THE END.</field>
