So now we are rydd of this Harlotts bratt: yf that we were as well shutt of the sonnes of Ammon we might lyue out of feare: But how that may be brought to passe I hardly can deuyse because their number's very greate, &amp; they are potent enemyes. polax Yt's true: &amp; yet to free our selues Â· yt standeth vs vpon wherefore about yt to consult let's forth wt h hence begone Iephte.

Wherefore I will deliuer you no more. Go now &amp; call vpon the gods wc h for me you haue chosen Astoroth &amp; Baal Let them saue &amp; deliuer you in the tyme of your distresse Ardellio, Mobal et ceteri.

Israel tooke not the land of Moab nor the childrens of Ammon But when he out of Ãgypt came he through the desert walked vnto the redd sea &amp; to cades, &amp; thence messengers directed vnto the kinge of Edom sayinge: Let me passe through thy land. The lyke request he made to Moab: but neyther his demaund would graunt: wherefore he stay'd in cades; &amp; afterward he compassed the Lands of Edom &amp; of moab, &amp; beyond Arnon camped where on Moab borders, &amp; he would not into Moab enter. He sent to Sehon kinge of th'Amorrheits also, who would not suffer hym to passe through his land but rays'd agaynst hym a great army &amp; our Lord vnto Israel deliuered hym &amp; his country. And wilt thou now possesse his land wc h god to hym deliuered? Are not those things due to the wc h chamos thy god possessed? why then shall not these things be ours wc h god obtaynd as conquerour? vnlesse perhaps thou better be then Balac sonne of sephor the kinge of Moab, or canst shew that he agaynst Israel wrangled or fought wt h hym whylst he in ye litle Towns of Hesebon dwelled or in all the citties nere to Iordan for three hundred yeares in all wc h tyme thou hast not yt reclaym'd as appeares &amp; therefore he in keepinge yt no wronge at all doth offer thee but in denouncinge vniust warrs thou dost to hym great iniury.

What we haue done we will mantayne: &amp; so thou may be gone &amp; vnto Iephte signify so much in Ammons name, who not wt h standinge his prescription agayne those countries clayme, where now he dwells, &amp; will them repossesse by dint of sword in spyte of Iephte &amp; the Israelits: So bringe them word from mee: &amp; tell hym I his message scorne, &amp; so adewe Legatus. Ammon I will, &amp; thou perhaps this thy contempt may rewe. To Iephte Iudge of Israel now this message I'l go beare. But stay in as fitt tyme as I could wish he cometh here Iephte most valiant prince thy worthy message Ammon scorneth &amp; sayth the land wc h you possesse to hym self apperteyneth &amp; hautely vnto your honour he sendes by me this worde that in dispite of you he'l winne the same by dint of sworde Iephte He might haue sayd yf god will hym permitt, whose powerfull spyrit imboldneth me wt h out delay hym in the field to meete. And to our Lord I make a vow yf he graunt me the victory &amp; make the sonnes of Ammon in these warres subiect vnto mee who s'euer first out of the dores of my house comes &amp; meetes mee in peace returninge, to our lord shall sacrificed bee in token of my thankfull mynd, for I assured am that yf I gett the victory yt's god that geues the same In whom puttinge my confidence agaynst Amon I'l go although my Army is but smale, &amp; he a potent foe I see thou neuer fayles them lord who do relye vpon thee &amp; I most humble thankes vnto thee render for this victory agaynst the sonnes of Ammon, whom thou by thy mighty power subdued hast, for wc h thy holy name be prays'd for euer And the vow that I made to thee I'l faythfully performe by sacrificinge the first thinge I meete at my returne that out of my house dore shall come.

Alas pore soule shee litle dreames that shee must dye so shortly. Yf my owne death would satisfy my vow I would dye for her: But shee yt ys that meetes me first that must dye &amp; no other. for sorrow I can not choose but rent the garments of my backe: syth no meanes there ys lefte to saue her lyffe, alack, alack. my vow ys made &amp; that to god who looketh for performance there of, &amp; yf I breake yt may iustly take on me vengeance.

And the dearer I am to hym so much more loue he sheweth to god in that he will not spare me whom he so much loueth. And lykewyse I will shew my loue both to god &amp; my father &amp; death at their goodwill &amp; pleasure most willingly will suffer for satisfaction of the debt wc h to them both I owe to th'one by reason of my sinne, to th'other for his vow Wherefore till these two monthes be past I'l wt h you virgins mourne here in the hills, &amp; then vnto my father backe returne. &amp; to expresse our sorrowfull hearts some dolefull tune lett's play vpon our instruments there wt h to passe the tyme away. So now the tyme of my returne's expir'd, I will be gone vnto my father whom I lefte makeinge for me greate mone Iephte Daughter I pray thee patience haue, &amp; take death in good parte as I do hope thou wilt syth for the same prepar'd thou art filia Iephte father performe your vow to god, &amp; that wt h all alacrity for vnto me death welcome ys syth you haue gott the victory agaynst your foes by gods good help, who lookes that you lykewyse accordinge to your vow should offer me to hym in sacrifice. wherefore no longer make delay for to dye I am willinge &amp; for your last farewell father bestow on me your blessinge Iephte Thy words sweete daughter pearce my heart &amp; make me for to sheede teares from myne eyes, &amp; will not lett my hands performe this deede. filia Iephte. What father will you not performe the vow to god you made, who was the cause so good successe agaynst your foes you had? So may you god offend: &amp; thinkeinge my lyfe for to saue both loose yt &amp; your owne, &amp; all the subiects els you haue, as in the late warres you had done, but that god fought for you, &amp; lykely ys you shall here after yf you breake your vow Wherefore deare father courage take, for I am no whit daunted wt h death, but wish wt h all my heart your vow may be obserued Iephte. Thy resolution daughter's great: &amp; glad I am to see (a thinge rare in the femal sexe) the willinge for to dye &amp; syth thou art resolued so to do, lyke wyse I will the offer vp in sacrifice my vow for to fulfill where fore prepare thy selffe. Daught[er]. father, I will. Now I am ready Iephte. Then here ly downe. Daught[er]. Wt h all my heart: now father do your duty Iephte God lord receiue this sacrifice of this my only daughter whom as a token of my thankfulnes to the I offer for that thou hast the Ammonits into my hands deliuered by whom for many yeares together my country was oppressed &amp; for this conquest thy fame shall throughout the world be blowne syth but for thy assistance lord we had bene ouerthrowne &amp; the daughters of Israel shall assembled be together once euery yeare, &amp; mourne foure days for the death of my daughter wc h I my self, &amp; those that in my place succeede shall see perform'd in memory of my daughters death &amp; my great victory. And that this custome may the better be obseru'd, I'l go &amp; here wt h both acquaint the peares &amp; people of Israel also Nuncius Now Iephtes vow you haue both heard &amp; seene yt also executed &amp; some amongst you may perhaps there at be scandalized thinkinge that yt was rashly made, &amp; perform'd vnaduisedly but in your censures of hym I could wish you to be wary for though in vowinge for to sacrifice who or what s'euer first mett hym comminge home wt h victory (wc h by hap was his daughter Syth he no speciall warrant had from god) yt's very probable he did offend: for some thinges were by the Law not sacrificable of wc h sort men &amp; women bee, yet all this not wt h standinge he synned not but rather gods wrath pacifie'd by performinge his vow, whose will for punishment of his synne yt sem'd to bee that he should sacrifice his owne daughter, whom he did loue so dearly syth by his diuine prouidence she mett hym the first of all, whose lyfe yf he had spar'd he might haue bene thought to be partiall rather out of his naturall loue &amp; fatherly affection vnto his only child, then for th'vnlawfulnes of th'action Sith god before this tyme had Abraham commanded lykwyse vnto hym for to offer vp his only sonne in sacrifice though afterward he would not yt permit for to be done when he his promptnes saw to put the same in execution but in his place an other host he out of hand prepared though here not so. And by her death no iniury she sustayned but rather profitt got there by, for all mankynd must dye through Adams synne, at gods appoynted tyme: &amp; from much misery here in this world shee's freed. And she died wt h her owne consent (wc h seemes to be by gods instinct) &amp; shee was also innocent &amp; there fore now her blessed soule ys in a ioyfull place: where as yf she had longer lyu'd, though but a litle space she might haue fallen into synne, beinge prone there to by nature &amp; both in this world &amp; the next haue lost gods loue &amp; fauour. And though her father did offend by vowinge vnaduisedly as his repentance meetinge first his daughter shewed playnly: yet hym wt h godly feare &amp; dreede god did permitt &amp; suffer to his owne bitter payne, to sacrifice his only daugther &amp; for to institute for her a yearly lamentation to th'ende that others might make their vowes wt h more circumspection And her promptnes in offeringe of her selffe for to be sacrificed her fathers fault did much extenuat, or his fact wholly iustified Where fore I wish ech one to iudge indifferently of his action &amp; leaue yt vnto god to whom the secret'st thinges are knowne &amp; shall reuealed be, &amp; iustly as they haue deserued receiue rewarde, in their due tyme &amp; place by god appoynted So hopinge you your censures will suspend, or iudge the best I will be gone &amp; leaue to tyme discouery of the rest.</field>
