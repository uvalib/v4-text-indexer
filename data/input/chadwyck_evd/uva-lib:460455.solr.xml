      <field name="fulltext">—Immitis placatur sanguine diro Teutates: horrensque feris altaribus Hesus.— Lucan. Pharsal. Lib. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. The story of the following Tragedy, like that of the foregoing, is fictitious, but I hope not entirely inconsistent with the manners and customs of the Celtic people. As the scene of action is laid in Britain, I have been obliged to desert the mythology of the Saxons for the institutions and ceremonies of the druids; some of these ceremonies have already been received by the public with delight, as displayed in the admirable tragedy of Caractacus; but although the variety and magnificence of of the Gothic religion is by no means rivalled by the Celtic, yet there appeared to me some parts of it untouched, which might be introduced into dramatic poetry with tolerable effect. The following piece is written, like Moina, on the ancient Greek model, and the choral odes are without rhyme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE PLAY. Starno, Briton. Daura, Briton. Kelric, a Saxon. Chorus of Druids.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE. A sacred Wood and an Altar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. DRUIDS. FIRST DRUID. In the dark covert of these sacred shades I wait with restless trembling expectation The joyful tidings of our chieftain's conquest; No more the voice of woe shall chill our hearts, No more the flying Briton here shall haste With fear-wing'd step to hide his fainting limbs, And tell the hateful tale of slaughter'd friends— But soon the shout of victory shall burst Upon our hallowed groves. In Starno's breast The soul of Hesus The soul of Hesus.] Hesus was the Celtic god of war. breathes, to Starno's arm He gives resistless strength, his beaming eyes Shoot forth destructive fire—well pleas'd to hear Our chieftain's bloody vow, Our chieftain's bloody vow.] The sacrifice of living men was considered by the Druids as peculiarly acceptable to some of their gods. Hesum et Teutatem Deos, says Lactantius, Lib. I. c. 21, a Gallis humano cruore fuisse placatos. ???????? ??? ?????????????? ????????? ??? ????? ??????? ??????????? ?? ??? ?????????. ??? ???? ?? ????????????? ???? ??????? Strabo, Lib. 4. These unfortunate victims were devoted to the gods either after or before a battle. Aut pro victimis, says Cæsar de Bell. Gal. Lib. 6. homines immolant aut se immolaturos vovent, quod pro vita hominis nisi vita hominis reddatur, non posse aliter deorum immortalium numen placari arbitrantur: publicèque ejusdem generis habent institutá sacrificia. Bellum Hermunduris prosperum, Cattis exitiosum fuit, quia victores diversam aciem diis sacravere, quo voto equi, viri, cuncta victa occidioni dantur. Taciti Annal. Lib. 13. c. 57. the god of battles Stalks by his side amid the glittering ranks, And wields his massy blade to strike for Britain. SECOND DRUID. Yes, holy man; the fearless soul of Starno Shall glut its vengeance in the gushing blood Of foes; but still the image of his child Will haunt his gloomy mind, will gnaw his heart. And while the warrior joys in shouts of battle, The father still shall heave the frequent sigh; O may some blessed hour again restore The blooming Daura to his eager arms, And chace the night of woe which shades his soul. CHORUS. When from the towering rock The keen-ey'd eagle spies The serpent's glistening side, Down, down he drops, Then bears aloft His struggling prey, And joyful cleaves with rapid wing The liquid fields of air; But soon the speckled foe uprears His hissing jaws, Deep in the fearless bird he sheaths His forked sting, The fearless bird with torture writhing, Firmly clasps his fatal prey, Plunges deep his pointed claws, Till torn with ghastly wounds The mangled serpent dies. Deep, deep in Starno's breast The dart of grief is fix'd, Fell revenge his bosom fires, He rushes with resistless rage To bathe his sinewy arm In purple blood— A SOLDIER. (Entering hastily.) Ye sacred men, I come with winged steps To tell the joyful victory of Starno, Strike, strike your golden harps and raise the song Of joy, your dauntless chief returns with conquest; Fierce was the battle's rage, the clanging shields Re-echoed loud, the swiftly darting steel With sparkling fragments strew'd the bloody earth, And hissing arrows hurtled in the air— Then in the thickest ranks was Starno seen Like Hesus' self he wing'd his bickering blade, And spread the gory field with mangled foes, The groans of death, the victors joyful shout Mix in the troubl'd sky—fear seiz'd the Saxons, They fled the strife of spears— DRUID. Haste, haste, and with your golden axes fell Your golden axes fell.] An account of this ceremony is to be found in Pliny. Lib. 16. C. 44. The waving branches of the sacred oak, Receive its falling leaves in snowy vests, And twine the dark-green leaves of victory. SOLDIER. Yet hear—the battle rag'd with fiercest fury, When on the plain we spied a Saxon warrior Who spurr'd his steed to reach the British camp, With him a woman fled—they quickly vanish'd, Conceal'd behind our tents—when tir'd with slaughter Our conquering chief return'd, his darling child Rush'd from the camp with breathless speed to meet him And clasp'd him in her arms. Fair Daura's charms Had won the Saxon chieftain's blooming son To bear her back to Starno's aching heart, And yield himself a willing captive with her. DRUID. This was beyond our hopes—but see, they come. Enter Starno, Daura, and Kebric. CHORUS OF DRUIDS. Hail, Hesus, hail, By thee inspir'd, The warlike chieftain dauntless braves The singing spear and biting blade— Hail, Hesus, hail, I see thee climb Thy rattling car And drive the furious steeds Amid the falling foe. Who dares to meet thy flaming eyes? Who dares to wait thy gleaming steel, The thunder-bolt of war? Death hovers round thy stately crest And shining shield, While pale eye'd Fear bestrides the blast And sails before thy car. Raise aloft, Andate, raise Andate raise.] Andate was the goddess of victory. Thy golden shield— Loudly strike its echoing orb And wake the sound of victory— From the purple field it comes To pierce our holy groves— Rude it rushes thro' the shades, The roaring rocks return The joyful noise— The warrior hears—he shouts aloud And clangs his sounding arms. STARNO. Ye venerable men, nor shouts of conquest, Nor fond endearments of a long-lost child, Revive my fainting soul—in secret horror My shuddering mind revolves the bloody vow These hallow'd groves have heard—that bloody vow Which calls aloud to pierce a generous heart On Hesus' holy altar—well ye know We solemnly devoted to the god The noblest captive that return'd with Starno. DAURA. The noblest captive?— DRUID. Yes, lady, and the god demands his victim, Our prayers were heard, he rais'd the arm of conquest. DAURA. My tortur'd mind beholds the rising storm Which hastes to overwhelm me. Father, father, Why do you cast your mournful eyes on Kelric? Is he the noblest captive?—Horror—horror— Away, away, who dares to touch my Kelric? Who dares to touch that Kelric who restor'd His long-lost daughter to her father's arms? That Kelric who entic'd by Daura's words Has quitted all for her? DRUID. Fair lady, peace, Nor dare to thwart the dread decrees of heav'n; Hesus demands the blood of Kelric.— KELRIC. Then let him glut his savage soul with blood, The victim cannot 'scape. The time was once When warlike Kelric would have smil'd at death; Oft have I rush'd amid th'embattled host, Nor fear'd the deadly dart, but now my soul Shrinks back with horror from the fatal sword Which tears me from my love. DAURA. No, Kelric, no— Thou shalt not bleed—who urg'd thy hasty steps To seek the Briton's camp? who won thy mind To scorn the dearest ties of friends and country? Who spurr'd thee on to death? 'twas Daura's self, 'Twas Daura's soothing accents led her Kelric To these detested groves—why sleep thy gods? Why does the lightning linger to destroy This cursed shrine? Arise, ye bloody priests, Here plunge the holy knife and pour my blood To please the sullen god—save, save my Kelric. STARNO. Now angry heaven has shower'd its keenest wrath On Starno's head—'Twas misery enough To wander weeping for a daughter lost, Thus to receive her, thus in Kelric's heart To plunge the steel, and with one fatal stroke To pierce the lover's and the daughter's bosom, Is more than Starno's sinking soul can bear; Why, Hesus, did the hissing dart avoid This wretched breast? why didst thou turn the spear From Starno's side? Had Saxons overwhelm'd me And stain'd their gleaming steel with aged blood, Then had I died with glory in the battle, Nor felt the piercing grief which tears my soul. DRUID. We see, with pity see, the cruel pangs Which rack the soul of Daura, and thy woes, O chief, are great; the blooming strength of Kelric, Untimely sinking to the grave, extorts The heart-felt sigh—yet warlike Hesus calls To lead the victim to his sacred altar And asks the promis'd blood— STARNO. My child, my child, The dews of death are o'er her—see, she faints, Retire, my Daura, deadly sorrow shakes Thy tender form—and you, ye sacred men, Prepare the holy rites, and wait our presence. [Starno and Kelric go off. CHORUS OF DRUIDS. God of the shining day, Whose golden locks In splendor wave And scatter liquid light, Belinus, in yon radiant Belinus, in thy radiant.] Belinus was the Celtic deity of the sun. path, Did e'er thy piercing eye behold A scene of blacker woe? Yet let not mortal voice accuse The dread decrees of Fate, And ask the angry thunder why it howls, Nor vainly dare with impious hand To thwart the lightning's course. Aloft on pitchy clouds Teutates rides, Teutates rides.] Teutates was a malicious god of the Celts, to whom they sacrificed human victims. And aims his fatal shaft, They who fearless stemm'd The rapid flood of war, Before him bow their crested pride And drop the tined spear; They whose swelling souls Exult with thrilling joy Before him bend their lofty head And keener feel his dart— Resistless power, Avert thy wrath From Britain's shore, Sink in thy sable clouds, And wing the fearful storm To other climes. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Druids—to them enter Starno leading Kelric. STARNO. Ye venerable men, with grief I lead The blooming victim to the unhewn altar— Is all prepared? DRUID. It is, the white rob'd priests The white rob'd priests.] See Drayton's Polyolbion. Ninth Song. With golden sickles in their aged hands Have cut the misletoe; the chaste-ey'd maids Have gather'd from the wood the sacred vervain, And with bent knees on Hesus' altar laid it; Around the pile is clos'd the mystic ring Of virgins, priests, and vigorous warriors. DAURA. (Entering.) Before the fatal knife has reach'd his heart, I come to take a last farewell of Kelric— Turn not, unhappy youth, the eyes of love On Daura's cursed form; frown, frown my Kelric, And blast me with thy looks—it will not be— Why does my wretched spirit linger yet, Nor cease to animate these limbs?—away, Haste to the floating clouds, and rush with speed To meet the ghost of Kelric. KELRIC. Daura, Daura— My firm nerves shake again, thy much lov'd voice Again unmans me, that all-beauteous form Adds double horror to the deadly blow— Why dost thou come to melt my aching breast And sink my sickly soul? Farewell, my love, Remember Kelric, let his mournful image Cleave to thy heart, and when the shades of death Shall dim those tearful eyes, then haste with joy To meet his fond embrace in halls of bliss. DAURA. Hark—'tis a horrid voice which shrieks—it cries Who murder'd Kelric?—Daura, wretched Daura Has pierc'd her lover's heart—enough—enough— I go—farewell—we soon shall meet, my love— Again it cries—Daura has murder'd Kelric— Hence, hated sound— See, see a ghastly vision rises on me, He bleeds, he bleeds—I mark his waving hand— I come—I come— [Goes out. DRUID. Begin the rites— Nine Druids Advance. CHORUS. Loudly strike the golden harp, While Echo from a thousand rocks Repeats the solemn strains— Haste, haste, thou dreadful god And hover on the blast Which bows the rustling wood Around thy shrine— Haste and quit the field of spears, In blood-stain'd arms attend Our holy rites. When on the mountain's side The prowling wolf discerns The bleating flock, Swift, swift he springs to carnage, And bathes his shaggy sides In gushing blood. When from its lofty height The famish'd vulture hears The dying groan, The dying groan revives His fainting heart, He stops his rapid flight And feasts his hungry eyes With human gore; Thus does the warlike god delight To view the purple flood, And grateful to his ears The shrieks of slaughter swell, But most he joys when white-rob'd priests His holy altar throng, And to its sacred side The trembling captive drag. Then let us lift the fatal knife And in the victim's blood Its shining point embrue. Nine Warriors advance. CHORUS. Raise the purple banners high, Rear aloft the massy shield And shake the shining spear. Hesus spies the gleam of arms And hastes to join the fight; Now he fires the warrior's soul And speeds his hissing dart; Now he throws his brazen shield Around his favour'd hero's breast, And blunts the deadly steel— Long may his desolating arm Attend the British host; Long may the Saxon fear his rage And view with ghastly look The lightning of his eye; Then lift, ye priests, the fatal knife, And in the victim's blood Its shining point imbrue. Nine Virgins advance. CHORUS. Awake the tuneful voice, And call with soothing sounds The god of war. See in the glittering ranks A father stands, He lifts his trembling arm To save his child— Rise, Hesus, rise, And cast thy full-orb'd shield Around his aged limbs— Nor let his silver hair Be stain'd with blood. See in the glittering ranks A husband stands, His fair wife moans Her absent lord. Now to her breast she clasps Her blooming boy, Now gazes on his lovely limbs, And in his infant features sees The father's face, Quick starts the gushing tear And mingles with her smiles; Rise, Hesus, rise, And cast thy full-orb'd shield Around the warrior's breast, Turn from his side the deadly dart And send him back with victory. See in the glittering ranks A lover stands; The mournful maid he loves With sullen step retires To thickest shades, There with her absent warrior's form She feasts her gloomy soul— Now she sees his manly frame Extended on the purple plain, She shrieks aloud and starting flies The horrid image fancy rais'd— Now in the passing gale She hears his conquering tread, And hastes to twine the oaken wreath To deck her lover's brow— Joy sparkles in her eyes, But yet one lingering tear descends And dews the shining leaves— Rise, Hesus, rise, And cast thy full-orb'd shield Around her warrior's heart, Turn from his side the deadly dart And send him back with victory. And you, ye holy priests, Uplift the fatal knife, And in the victim's blood Its shining point imbrue. STARNO. Hail, Hesus, hail, To thee we pour The consecrated blood. MESSENGER. (Entering in haste.) Stop, stop your holy rites, I come to tell A melancholy tale—With hasty steps Fair Daura left these shades, with hasty steps She reach'd the castle walls and sought her chamber; Sudden her servants heard a dying groan Which issued from the room—they rush'd to save her— In vain they rush'd—her hands were stain'd with blood And on her couch she lay a breathless corse. [Starno retires. KELRIC. (Snatching the knife from the altar.) Enough—she bled for me—I haste to join her— [Stabs himself. Daura, we soon shall meet in halls of bliss, We soon shall wander in Valhalla's groves Where endless rapture gilds the passing hours— Odin, receive my fainting soul, and ope The doors of heaven— [Dies. CHORUS OF VIRGINS. Retire thou golden sun, And shroud thy ruddy orb In murky night, Ye dreary shades resound With horrid howlings, Let the death-owl cry And pierce the sacred wood With doleful sounds, For blooming Daura falls, And Kelric's gushing blood The green earth stains.— Mysterious Heav'n, Thy dark decrees No mortal eye can pierce; Beneath the blushing rose The thorn is hid, Beneath the flowery bank The serpent lurks unseen, And joy's transporting draught Is dash'd with bitter woe. The azure sky is calm, The gale soft whispers in the peaceful air, The glassy lake reflects The verdant shrubs around— But soon the troubled air is gloom'd With pitchy clouds, The rushing blasts descend, The deep-ton'd thunder roars And lightnings hiss around, The angry spirit of the lake Dashes his dark-blue waves And rides in foam. Thus in Daura's peaceful soul The raging tempest rose, It tore her tender form And bow'd her gentle head. THE END.</field>
