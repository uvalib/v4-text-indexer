      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND CALENDER; And the Queen of Beauty, WHO HAD THE FIGHT WITH THE GENIE. AN EXTRAVAGANZA, In Two Acts,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROGRAMME OF SCENERY, INCIDENTS, &amp;c. Introductory Scene, &amp;c. Showing how the Princess, the beautiful Daughter of the King of the Ebony Isles, got into the power of the Genie,—a circumstance hitherto kept secret from the public. THE PIC-NIC IN THE DESERT. Frightful accident—nearly resulting in loss of life—A blind bargain (of one eye). AN IMPENETRABLE FOREST. Prince Agib's unfortunate attachment discovered (by the scene shifters.) The virtuous peasant. GRAND SCENA, BY MR BUCKSTONE, (Accompanied by Extraordinary Movements by Miss A. Romer.) Labour and the Poor. A strike! and an unexpected turn-out. THE GENIE'S SUBTERRANEAN PALACE. “The vicissitudes of a servant girl,” by an “acknowledged heroine of Domestic Drama,”—The Captive Princess—Friends calling and dropping in. THE TALISMAN! (Which has been considered an appropriate subject for treatment by the authors of “Ivanhoe.”) TERRIFIC SMASH AND ALARMING SACRIFICE! The virtuous wood-cutter makes a beast of himself, and the vicious Genie makes one of Prince Agib. First appearance on any stage of THE APE OF THE DEAD SEA, (By the kind permission of Thomas Carlyle, Esq.) THE DOOM OF THE PRINCESS OF THE EBONY ISLES? A VERY DESERT ISLAND. Terrific situation and horrible plagiarism (on a popular dramatist). A lovely woman in the deepest distress rescued by gallant spirits in every way worthy of the name of British Tars. Romantic appearance of a remarkably jolly boat—And timely intervention of the Act Drop. PUBLIC PLACE IN CURRIPOUDAH, (The capital portion of Mulligatawney.) A city in a temporary state of Indian pickle. Arrivals for the Grand Mulligatawney EXHIBITION OF ALL NATIONS! Rapid Progress of the Resident Directress!!! TERRIFIC BALLOON ASCENT! The Musical Contributions of all Nations to the Exhibition, by Miss P. Horton. WANTED—A VIZIER! Know thyself! Infallible test of character by the handwriting. The Wanderers. General Election, and choice of a New Ministry. The Queen of Beauty's Sanctum Sanctorum! And Select Committee-Room of the Exhibition. PRIVY COUNCIL CHAMBER of the Rajah Mulligatawney; BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. A magnificent effort of the Fancy in several rounds. “Truth prevails and virtue is triumphant!” Overthrow of the powers of darkness, and rapid consummation of the aims of light and science, manifested in The Queen of Beauty's Crystal Palace!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO J. BALDWIN BUCKSTONE, Esq. OF THE HAYMARKET THEATRE. Dear Buckstone, Suppose we dedicate this Burlesque to you. We have no objections; and if you have any, you will not be in time to urge them, as—unless our plot against you happens to be betrayed by some Tresham of a compositor or printer's devil—you will know nothing about it till the entire impression of the work has issued from that celebrated “Nassau Steam Press,” of which our friend Johnson is so justly proud. The fact is, this piece owes more to you than you may be aware of. No allusion is intended to your admirable performance of the hard-working woodcutter; where all were excellent it would be unfair to signalize one, however good. Nor yet to the fact of your having suggested (and how gloriously assisted in carrying out the suggestion!) one of the greatest “goes” in the piece—the parody on In my Cottage. Our chief obligation to you arises from the fact of your having unconsciously and unintentionally helped us out of the greatest “fix” the treatment of our subject placed us in. How to finish our first Act we had not the ghost of an idea, when a copy of your Green Bushes providentially fell into our hands. This happened to remind one of us of an effect in it that might be stolen to effect our infamous purpose. We read it; it would do! With the prompt rapacity of the comic writer we seized on it. You know the result. This dedication is therefore a sort of conscience-money— a kind of compensation that a penitent ogre might make to a bereaved parent, whose offspring he has devoured. Seriously though (if the public will believe in anything serious among such tremendously funny dogs as ourselves), as a slight tribute of esteem for a man whom it is a pleasure to write for, and to know, this trifle is gratefully inscribed by Your sincere friends and admirers, BROUGH, BROTHERS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS IN THE INTRODUCTION. EPITIMARUS THE GREAT, (King of the Ebony Isles—a country not half so black as it is painted) Mr. Jas. Bland. AL KUTITPHAT, (an Officer attached to the Court, probably Prime Minister, or Butler, or something) Mr. A. Brindal. JARJARHEES, (“The Son of the Daughter of Eblis,” a Genie or Phantasm Captain) Mr. Chas. Selby. THE PRINCESS GULNARE Mrs. L. S. Buckingham. A CABMAN, (from the lowest Ranks) Master Caulfield. CHARACTERS IN THE DRAMA. PRINCE AGIB, (the “Second Calender” of history, who, having no name in the original legend, has taken the nearest he could lay his hand on; a Prince of a Fellow, afterwards an Ape of the Dead Sea) by Miss Annie Romer (her first appearance at this theatre), and Mr. Lebarr (“The same to him and many of them.”) The above has been found such a remarkably strong part as to require two people to play it. CODJA, (a more than ordinarily virtuous Woodcutter, distantly related, it is thought, to the Codjas, of Codja's Hall. A Solemnly-Constituted Impostor, subsequently a Melodious Windbag) Mr. Buckstone. THE PRINCESS GULNARE, (whom the audience will be delighted to see again) Mrs. L. S. Buckingham. JARJARHEES, (whom they won't) Mr. Chas. Selby. ZUBEYDEH, (his Maid of All-work, and hitherto no Play, this being the first she has appeared in) Mrs. Fitzwilliam. CRANBOURN ALI, (Rajah of Mulligatawney, an Indian Compound, “made of pepper and that sort of thing”) Mr. James Bland, Whose inexhaustible dignity renders him fully equal to any two monarchs. Note.—As the joke of Mr. Bland, in this character, representing at the same time at Injiu and a Buffer, is sure to be made by somebody, the Authors think they may as well make it at once and get it over. DOST YMILLAH, (a Purolind and Opaque Flunkey) Mr. Caulfield. FALDERAL LAL SINGH Mr. Clark. AMEER STIKH Mr. Coe. THE PRINCESS ZAIDE, surnamed THE QUEEN OF BEAUTY, (the Rajah's talented and spirited Daughter—in every sense of the word a charming woman; projectress of the grand Mulligatawney Industrial Exhibition, and Pretty-fellow of the Royal College of Fairies Miss P. Horton. SWEETLIPS AND TIFFIN, (her Fairy Secretaries) Miss Woulds, and Miss A. Woulds. THE SMALLEST PART IN THE PIECE Miss Caulfield. Guards, Flunkies, Plebeians, Phantasms, Paper Lanterns, Stump Orators, &amp;c., &amp;c.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. —An oasis in the Desert. The foreground representing a deliciously fertile spot. The back of the scene an immense expanse of sand lighted by a hot Eastern Sun. A rock piece (R.) running to the top of the scene, giving the idea of a lotty cliff overrun with gourds, melons, &amp;c. Another rock (L.) with clumps of palms, &amp;c. Epitimarus the Great, King of the Ebony Isles.— Gulnare, his daughter—Al Kutitphat, and the entire Court, Guards, &amp;c., seated about the stage forming a pic-nic party. Guards armed in the back ground, and the heads of two or three camels seen above the bushes. A kettle boiling over an extempore fire, as usual in such cases. The scene opens to a great noise of laughter and chattering. Epitimarus has a napkin under his chin, and is picking the drumstick of a turkey. SONG. (Epitimarus and Chorus.) 1. In the days when we went gipseying, A long time ago, The Park of Richmond suited us, Nor Hampton Court seem'd low; We cook'd the native sausages In Epping Forest Green, Or tipp'd our bits of silver to The Norwood Gipsey Queen; For views, in those old coaching times, Were circumscribed and slow, In the days when we went gipseying, A long time ago. 2. Now, folks go yachting round the world; And fast and daring gents Make, in balloons, equestrian And asinine ascents; E'en Cockney sportsmen spurn at hares, With tigers to engage. And scarce a move is fast enough To meet this rapid age: The hot and sandy desert, p'raps, Where fierce siroccos blow, As a place to choose for gipseying, They won't consider slow. Epi. Put up the camels—round the bottle hand, boys Here we, at least, can be jolly as sand-boys; Open all hampers, eatable and vinous. [Holding up champagne to Al Kutitphat. Do me the pleasure. Al K. (Accepting the challenge.) Thank you. Epi. (To another Guest.) P'raps you'll jine us. [They take wine. Now! Where's that salad? Attendant. Here! Epi. We'd not be pressing; But if you don't look sharp you'll get the dressing. Is that hot water coming? Servant. (At fire.) In a minute. Epi. Mind what you're at with it, or you'll be in it. I call this jolly. Gul. (Screams.) Ah! Epi. What ails my pet? Gul. Here's such a spider drop't in my sherbet. Al Kut. (Drawing his scimitar melodramatically.) He dies! [Guards draw their swords and rush to the rescue. Epi. (Interposing.) Desist! Your sovereign forgives E'en Treason on a day like this. Al K. (Sheathing his scimitar.) He lives! [Guards full back into their places. Epi. Would'st have our pleasures marr'd by blood and sorrow? [An attendant lets a dish fall on his head. Holloa! My friend, your head comes off to-morrow. There, clear away! [Attendants clear away with alacrity, interrupting the guests in the middle of their meal. Much chagrin expressed on the assembled countenances. Gul. Law, Pa! We have'nt done. Epi. The King has—so has every mother's son. “Give ev'ry man his dessert”— [An Attendant (L.) carrying fruit, stumbles over his legs. Repeat that tripping, And you're not he “who shall escape a whipping.” [Attendants pass with fruit. Dates! Here we'll take the dish, as some one states, “I like to be particular in dates”— Friends, isn't this delightful? Al K. What can match it? [All affect the greatest pleasure. Epi. Be more extatic, please, or else you'll catch it. Here, free from pomp and state, at ease delightful, We lounge—(starts) Holloa! I've sat on something frightful— And gazing upon Nature's charms, may scoff At envy's stings— [A large Mosquito (from R.) settles on his nose. Here! Murder! Keep him off! [Attendants drive Mosquito away. Yes; Here we throw all ceremony by, As now I throw this date stone— [He jerks a date stone violently over his shoulder. A fearful voice is immediately heard (through trumpet) exclaiming—“Oh! my eye.” Thunder! The stage is darkened. All express the greatest terror. Epi. What's that? Al K. Sire, some one call'd— Epi. Tell him we're out; Gul. We're in for something dreadful, past a doubt. [Thunder repeated. CONCERTED. (“Guy Fawkes”.) Epi. We smell a doleful tragedy; some fiendish prince of sinisters Means mischief to th'assembled Lords, the King, and all his ministers. Gul. That is, he means, but as for me, a large amount I'll bet him— He don't do what he means, for I don't mean to stay and let him. Voice. (Repeats.) Oh! my eye! Chorus. (In a phrenzy of terror.) Ri tol de riddle iddle! [The Genie Jarjarhees appears on rock L., brandishing an enormous scimitar. He has a cotton pocket handkerchief bound over one eye. The Chorus yell out “Oh, my eye!” finishing the tune, and all rush out screaming, except Epitimarus, who is too frightened. Jar. Who pitch'd that date stone? Epi. Mercy! Jar. Hah! I knew it! Epi. But, mighty Sir, I didn't go to do it. Jar. You pitch'd it rather strong, for which you die. Epi. Die—pray, explain it all? Jar (In agony, putting his hand to his face.) It's all my eye! SONG. (Jarjarhees.) “I'm sitting on the stile, Mary.” Just sitting in a style airy, In which we Genies glide, On a fast young whirlwind's best box-seat I'd booked a place outside; I heard your singing, since no doubt That name you call it by; And I came here just in time to get A date-stone in my eye. The place is precious sore—very, You can't conceive the pain; And what grieves me more, henceforth I shall Be looked upon as plain— For I miss the soft glance of one eye. Which volumes used to speak, And must wear through life a green silk patch, Which don't improve the cheek. 'Tis lost for ever, Fate's stern voices cry out, Through endless ages—“There he goes with his eye out,” Your life must pay for it—Stump up! it's due; For this lost eye o'me, an I O U. Epi. One word. Jar. What is it? Epi. If I really blinded it Great Spirit! I don't you think you should have minded it? Jar. Gammon! (Going to strike.) Epi. Another word— Jar. Speak on, we'll let you. Epi. P'raps into the Ophthalmic we could get you? Jar. An optical delusion. Epi. Stay a minute— A pot of Golden Ointment? Jar. Nothing in it! Epi. We'll levy an eye water rate? Jar. All stuff. Epi. Purchase all Grimstone's stock? Jar. Not worth a snuff! Down with the dust, or rather with the sand. (Forcing him to his knees, and about to strike.) Epi. Have mercy! [The Genie is about finishing him, when Gulnare rushes in and seizes his arm. Gul. Monster! Stay thy murd'rous hand! [Tableau. I've triumph'd over fear and circumspection, To save, from cutting, such a dear connection. [Jarjarhees lets his scimitar fall, and gazes on Gulnark with admiration. Jar. What brilliant vision dazzles thus my eye, My eye! first person singular—Oh, cry! A pretty visage this, to charm a maid, Unless she's not partic'lar to a shade. (To Epi.) Your daughter? Epi. (Presenting her.) Yes; my fireside's chief adorning; (Aside to Gulnare.) He wants to speak to you, my dear. Good morning. [Pushing Gulnare towards Genie, and offering to run away. Jar. Here, stop! [Epitimarus stops frightened. I'll let you go— Epi. (Going again.) Oh! thank you! Jar. Stay! On one condition only— Epi. Name it, pray. Jar. (Looking smirkingly at Gulnare.) That what I ask of you is fair, you'll grant— Epi. No doubt. Well, what? Jar. Your daughter— Gul. That he sha'n't. Epi. Pooh, pooh! he shall. Yes, Sir, this priceless treasure I yield without regret—nay, e'en with pleasure. Take her—be happy!—bless you!—and may she Never desert—you—as—she—now—does—me! [In a broken voice, joining their hands after the manner of Comedy fathers. Gul. What! is't for this, so fondly, me you've rear'd, And, on my schooling, no expenses spar'd, To be a low, coarse, one-eyed Genie's bride? Epi. (Aside to her.) Pooh, pooh! You'll manage—get on his blind side. Gul. A thing of shades and patches— Epi. He'll be blind To half your faults. Gul. One sided views you'll find He'll take— Jar. Consent or not? Epi. Of course, we'll make her. Gul. It is the one-eyed monster— Epi. Pooh! Deuce!—take her. [Pushing her over to Jarjarhees. She's under age and must. Jar. My prize I grab! Gul. Mercy! Epi. Good bye, dear—write home often. Jar. Cab! [A small demoniac Cabman, with badge and whip rises through vampire trap. Cabby. Here y'are, sir! Jar. Hansom? Cabby. Werry! Jar. Look alive! [Cabby goes to wing, 3 E. L., and leads in a Hansom cab drawn by a griffin. Jarjarhees hands Gulrane in. Cabby mounts perch. Gul. Pity! Epi. Needs must, dear, when such devils drive. CONCERTED. “Cab! cab! cab!” Jar. Now, drive along, good cabby! Cabby. Where to, sir? Jar. Down below! Epi. Good bye, dear! Gul. Pa! it's shabby! To serve your daughter so! Epi. Pooh! nonsense! drive along. Jar. All right! Gul. No, no! all wrong! Jar. Cab! cab! cab! cab! what are you at? Why don't you drive along? Chorus. Cab, cab, &amp;c. Epi. When settled nice and snugly, You'll think of poor papa! Gul. To wed a Genie ugly— Epi. There, that'll do, tah—tah! [Waving his hand. Gul. One moment—hear me pray? Epi. No, thank'ee, not to day! Jar. Cab! cab! cab! cab! what are you at! Drive on, you know the way! Chorus. Cab, cab, &amp;c. [The Cab drives off R. Epitimarus looks after it and then runs away L. SCENE II. —An impenetrable forest. Flats in 2nd grooves enclose the first scene; at the same time the rock piece R. is moved out, and discovers a large tree, to which Prince Agib is bound by strong ropes, and is struggling violently. Agib. Help! Murder! Thieves! Come, somebody Holloa! Police! That cry's but little use, I know; Help! Murder! Thieves! Holloa! It seems I should Holloa some time before I'm out o'th'wood. Holloa! Enter Codja, L., the woodcutter, with axe and bill-hook. Codja. Now, then!—What shindy, may I ask, Summons the child of labour from his task? Agib. (Struggling violently.) Cut. Codja. (Going.) Certainly. Agib. No! Cut away, fool! Codja. (Going.) Good! Exactly what I came for—cut my wood. Agib. Ass! Cut away these cords and let me go, You shall be handsomely rewarded. Codja. Oh! In that case could an honest heart do less Than help a fellow-creature in distress; Know that the peasant's heart as nobly throbs As those beneath the broider'd vests of nobs, And proudly as the silk-clad sons of Lucre Stands the poor woodman in his lowly Blucher. (Thumps his breast à la stage countryman.) Agib. I recognize you by your moral clamour, The virtuous peasant of domestic drama. Codja. The toil-worn cottager— (Thumping his breast and not heeding Agib.) Agib. Well, that's enough— Codja. Though humbly clad— Agib. All fustian and mere stuff! SONG. (Agib.) “Woodman, spare that Tree.” Woodman, set me free, Stop not to scrape or bow; Release me from this tree, Or else there'll be a row; For hours I've had to stand Bound tightly to this spot: Then, Woodman, lend a hand, Just axe this blessed knot. GRAND SCENA. (Codja.) Air, with variations, “In my Cottage.” In my cottage near a wood, Just as I sat down to dine, There's a cove, said I, with good Lungs a kicking up a shine; In distress he seems, and we May come in for something good; This was what occurred to me In my cottage near a wood. [Codja cuts the cords and releases Agib. Agib. (Shaking himself.) Thanks! Codja. Is that all? Agib. Not half. I'll pay my debts! [Feeling his pockets. Alas! how stupid of me—no assets! My friend, I owe you much, would I could pay Your services with gold— Codja. Don't name it, pray; Think you the lowly woodman had in view The filthy dross named gold!—No!—Silver 'll do. Agib. Alas! my friend, who steals my purse steals trash: 'Twas mine—'tis his—had he but left the cash! But he who filches from me all my tin— In short, you understand the mess I'm in: Robb'd by a set of good-for-nothing tramps, Who tied me to that tree— Codja. I know the scamps; The long reports of whose burglarious crimes Fill, ev'ry morning, pages of the Times; Who keep our wives awake all night with fear— Disturbing drowsy husbands with “My dear! Get up and take the poker—Hark! what's that?” And won't believe that anything's the cat; At whose dread name each rustic spirit flutters, And goes to the expense of iron shutters; Who're suffered recklessly to break the peace, Because the county won't pay for police. Agib. For what they took from me they've dearly paid, Sixteen low ruffians lower still I laid, Sliced their thick heads off, which you'll own was good cutting. Codja. Their heads! You must have served your time to wood cutting. Agib. Zooks! p'rhaps at that I might some skill employ; I must do something! (to Codja.) Please d'you want a boy? 'Cause if you do just speak, and I'm your man. Codja. What can you do? Agib. I drove a caravan This morning. Codja. Pickford's? Agib. Nothing half so low. Slaves, camels, horses, elephants, you know— All which were from me by the robbers riven, And now to seek a livelihood I'm driven. Codja. Ah! you won't suit. Agib. I'd serve you well—sincerely; I ask no wages—food and lodging merely. Codja. (Suddenly changing his tone.) When did a tale of sorrow fail to touch The humble peasant's heart? (Aside.) He can't eat much. Agreed! begin at once. Agib. With right good will. Codja. (Giving him a bill hook.) Just put your hand please to this little bill, And this (giving him a hatchet); and now, about your business caper, While the poor woodman goes to read the paper. [Exit 2 E. L. Agib. This, for a sovereign, is no small change, “But now a king—now thus,” 'tis passing strange; Too far away from home and friends to write, Stripp'd of my ev'ry sous—a pretty plight! And in a foeman's land, where, if found out, Our royal hash is settled, past a doubt. Well! at Dame Fortune let's not make wry faces, 'Twere p'raps as well if more folks in high places, Just now and then, were sentenced to endure A taste or two of Labour and the Poor! SONG. (Agib.) “Old Ned.” Oh! I once was a king, and my word was said To be law to the high and the low; Now I've got no crown on the top of my head— The place where the crown ought to go; Then break up the cabinet, and oh! oh! oh! Knock up the council and bureau; There's naught but hard work for me, instead Of the games that I once used to go. My civil list was long as the Anaconda snake, Now I've got no guards for to fee, I have no parliament the laws for to make, So I have let the government be, Then break up the cabinet, &amp;c. Here goes! (looking at the tree to which he was bound.) To you, old friend, I owe a grudge, And, though you look so big, I'll make you budge; Though not quite Ajax, or Professor Keller, I always was esteem'd a famous feller. [Commences chopping tree, singing to his work Air, “Through the Wood.” Through the wood, through the wood, dinners to find me, Bury the hatchet, pitch into it well; I leave ev'ry thought of my kingship behind me, And merge in the woodman each trace of the swell. Hew the wood, hew the wood, dinners to find me, Work like a nigger is what I propose; Through the wood, through the wood, look not behind me, But follow my nose and my bus'ness. Here goes. (Chopping.) Follow, follow, something 'twill find me; Follow, follow, care leave behind me. [As he finishes his song he strikes the tree a violent blow, breaking in the trunk, and disclosing a large hollow space. The axe slips out of his hand and disappears into the tree. Agib. Well, come! privations serve to show us kings The rottenness and hollowness of things; Why, where's the axe? (looking into tree.) If that's gone, I shall catch it; Peace won't ensue from burying the hatchet. [Looking down the tree. Why, I declare! I can't see to the bottom, Such trees as these, all I can say is, rot 'em; Here, master! governor! this is a bore! Enter Codja, yawning. Codja. Methought I heard a voice cry “Sleep no more!” I dreamt the malt-tax banish'd, beer was cheap; “If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep.” Agib. (Rousing him.) Oh, master! such remarkable adventures! Just look at your apprentice's indentures. [Pointing to the hole in the tree. The hatchet's gone—lost! Codja. Where? Agib. Down there! Codja. Come, own it; You haven't lost it, boy—you've been and thrown it. Agib. Not so—it's tumbled down that dark and fell pit; But, if you please, I really couldn't help it. But see, a winding staircase circles round This gloomy well—I'll find it, I'll be bound. [Going to descend. Codja. Let well alone, or else by some ill luck it Might chance that, in that well, you'd kick the bucket. Listen to me, boy. In such spots as these, Made beautiful by streamlets, rocks, and trees, The headstrong tourist, ravish'd and delighted By nature's charms, oft feels himself invited To enter some enchanting glen or pass, Thinking it free to all men, when, alas! Breathing out flames of bitterness and wrath, Some very scaly dragon stops his path, By whom all claims to “Right of Way” are jilted, Nor can you hurt the snake, though “Scotch'd and kilted.” Agib (brandishing the billhook). Death to such monsters! Thou my mettle piercest, I'll run a tilt—aye, Glen Tilt—with the fiercest. SONG. “Cam' ye by Athol.” Care ye for Athol's braw lads wi' their philibegs, Tartans, and kilts, which but cover them barely? Down with the carles who of way would our right blockade, Closing the mountains and passes unfairly. Cheerly! cheerly! who would not follow me, Claims such as those to upset, though kept warily. Really! really! though the earth swallow me, Death to the Highland hearts grudging so charily. [He descends the tree. SONG.—Codja. “The brave old oak.” It's rum for an oak, For a brave old oak, That has stood in the greenwood long, To be lined all round With a patent iron-bound Sort of fire-proof staircase strong. I'd forfeit a brown, If to venture down Through its winding ways I durst. Still I argue as how, In case of a row, I'm all right—as the boy's gone first. [Approaching the tree valiantly. Then, here's to the oak, To the brave old oak. [The orchestra supplies the rest. Codja approaches the tree, exhibiting, in pantomime, alternately great courage and great trepidation, ultimately going down, and finishing the tune by singing “I'm gone!” as he disappears. SCENE III. —The Genie's Subterranean Palace. Jarjarhees standing in centre of stage, with a large black patch over his eye; Zubeydeh brushing his wings. Zub. There, now you'll do. Jar. All right—I'm off to sup; I'll take the key with me, so don't sit up. Stay—show a light. [He produces a demoniac pipe, which he lights at a candle held by Zubeydeh, sending out immense volumes of smoke. There, now—you needn't wait. Tell your young missis that I shan't be late. Zub (aside.) Wuss luck! Jar. And upon pain of death—d'ye hear— See that she wants for nothing. Zub. (Aside.) Never fear! You're going out—that's all that she requires. Yes, sir! Jar. And, mind, be careful of the fires; And see the doors all right—for there's no knowing, Just now, so many burglaries are going. Remind me, by the bye, to re-insure That forest entrance—we must be secure: The charm's expired, and mortals may assail. Let no one in. Zub. Of course not! Jar. If you fail To mind your P's and Q's and eyes, you know, I'll rack your bones with aches. For the sake of this joke, the reader is requested to restore the impressive diction of the Kemble School, and pronounce this word aitches! D. I. O. [Going. Stop! If that imp of darkness calls about Last year's Poor Devil Rates, just say I'm out. [Strikes the scene, C., and disappears through it. Zub. Good riddance of the very wust of rubbage! Who would endure the endless toil and scrubbage, The dirty work—too horrible to call work— Expected from a Genie's maid of all work? SONG. (Zubeydeh.) 1. I'm maid of all work here, To a Genie who'd skin an old flea, My wages is four pound a year, And I finds my own sugar and tea; No followers suffered except When a bogy, or sprite, grim and dark, wisits; It's a place where no footman is kept, And which don't yield a penn'orth of parquisites. Ran, tan, tan, &amp;c. 2. I'm rung up as soon as it's light, To take up his breakfast things; And then to sup, with him at night, The dreadful low set that he brings; Their language is shocking and coarse, Their smoking would choke any bar-woman; But still I'd submit without sauce, If he'd only allow me a char-woman. Ran, tan, tan, &amp;c. Here comes his victim—moved here to be married To him—in fact, not only moved, but carried. Question proposed or popp'd by the Genie; Seconded by her Pa, who was to die; The casting vote, a strong cast in the eye. Enter Gulnare, 1 E. R. Gul. My good Zubeydeh— Zub. Pray, ma'am, don't take on so. Gul. Once taken off from hence, I ne'er had done so. Each day his hated suit he presses stronger; I fear he won't be trifled with much longer. This morn he told me that the wedding day To-morrow must be named. Zub. Don't name it, pray. Gul. But how to put him off? Zub. How?—Very easy. Order your dresses, which, of course, won't please ye; Have them refitted, alter'd, pull'd about, Lengthen'd and shorten'd, taken in, let out. Ne'er mind his magic!—In affairs like those, A woman, if to work she rightly goes, I'll back, in spite of whole demoniac legions, To bother the entire infernal regions. Gul. But to what end put all these plans in force? Zub. The end of time, if requisite, of course. Gul. Good creature! though you on a demon wait, “Thou art a spirit all too delicate To act his earthy and abhorr'd commands.” If I should e'er escape his dirty hands— Zub. Well, if you should, of my poor claims observant, P'raps you'll remember “summut for the servant.” Still we've small hope in these enchanted walls, Shut from the world, where no one ever calls. Agib. (Outside.) Holloa! Gul. What's that? Zub. What's what? Gul. Nay, that you know Better than I—listen again! Agib. (Nearer.) Holloa! Gul. There's somebody—at all events their voices. Zub. “Be not afeard—the isle is full of noises That give delight and hurt not.” [A noise is heard as of some one falling down stairs, accompanied by a yell of pain from Codja. Gul. Harmless dins! Codja. (Outside.) Why don't they light the gas? I've broke my shins. [A tapping at the door in back. Zub. Who's there? Agib. (Outside.) A man. Codja. (Ditto) And fragments of another. Zub. We keep a blunderbuss; go home! don't bother! Gul. Do let them in. Zub. I daren't for all the earth. 'Twere more by ten times than my place is worth. [Agib continues knocking. CONCERTED “You'd better stop dat knockin'.” Zub. Oh, stop that row, you'll wake the dead Your bus'ness go about; We're all undress'd and gone to bed, The lights are all put out. Agib. (Through key-hole.) No, no, a light the keyhole through Has shot, and flames of joy Has kindled in my heart, which no Cold water can destroy. Zub. But who's there?—Who's there? Oh, you'd better stop that knocking at the door. Agib., Gul. Let me in./Let them in. Zub. Stop that knocking, &amp;c. Well, I mustn't keep 'em knocking at the door. [Zubeydeh opens door and admits Agib and Codja. Agib. (Looking at Gulnare.) Beautiful! Gul. (Ditto at him.) Overpow'ring! Zub. Vexing! Codja. (Looking round.) Plummy. Agib. Rare though inexplicable! Codja. (Looking at Zubeydeh.) Nice, though crummy! Agib. I hope we don't intrude. Zub. Indeed you do. If master only catches you— Codja. Eh—who? Zub. A Genie! Codja. (Frightened.) Oh! we'd better not remain: Just leave a card, and say we'll call again. [Trying to pull Agib away. Gul. Stay, I implore you! Agib. Do you? That'll do. Hang up my turban, please—and chairs for two. Zub. You'll get us into trouble—Go! like good men. Gul. Stay! if ye be not stones. Codja. We're simply woodmen. Agib. Now do be quiet, please. Codja. I only spoke; The humble woodman tried a lowly joke, To keep his spirits up, which fast were sinking, To use a low-born simile, like “winking.” Gul. (To Zubeydeh' L.) Do let them stay, one sees a human face So seldom in this lone and dreary place. No matter how they gained admission—do? Zub. I'm undecided—Master's out, it's true. Codja. Eh! for how long? Zub. We're sure to have fair warning— Hearing him shout—“We won't go home till morning!” As he's brought home on an enchanted shutter, By imps who found him in some magic gutter. Codja. The woodman breathes! Zub. Well, p'raps, as they are here They'd better stop to supper. Gul. There's a dear! Agib. I'll stay till morning's earliest azure hue Streaks the dull clouds. Codja. I'll stay till all is blue. For though of course the sumptuous banquet must Be far less toothsome than the hard-earned crust; Labour's the finest sauce that could exist, And the hard-working woodman has a twist. [Zubeydeh appears with a supper tray, L. Zub. (Aside.) Doubts and misgivings dark my bosom chafe, They're strangers quite—I hope the spoons are safe. Agib. (Looking at supper) Huzza! three cheers for such luxurious store! [Agib, Gulnare, and Zubeydeh seat themselves. Codja (Looking round for a seat.) Three cheers! I'll trouble you for one cheer more. [Finds a chair and sits down. Agib. It's a delicious dream—(to Codja), I say, don't shake, I wouldn't for the world be wide awake. Codja. Thus does the lowly but contented heart Resignedly pitch into ven'son tart, And without envy or repinings vain, Wet his hard-working whistle with champagne. Agib. (To Gul.) Allow me. Gul. Thanks!—but now your candour taxing, Inform me how you found your way?— Agib. By axing. For once—not guessing how it would have ended, To dark and crooked ways I had descended. Through passages we came, which 'spite their mystery, Prove the most interesting in my history. [Bowing. But may I ask some trifling explanation, Of finding you in such a situation? Gul. Alas! I am engaged— Agib. Pray, don't say so. Gul. Against my will—to wed a Genie. Agib. Oh! If that's all we'll soon settle him. Gul. (Terrified.) He'd kill you. Agib. (To Zubeydeh—smiling contemptuously.) Just ring the bell, and have him brought in, will you? Zub. Would'nt on no account! Agib. There is a bell. He answers—then? Zub. Why—there's what does as well. Whene'er we want him, which we seldom do, We hit that talisman a stroke or two. [Pointing to a gong hanging up. Agib. That! Zub. Yes; you know the things they advertise, Useful for dinners, fires, or burglaries. Agib. That brings him, does it? Zub. Yes, ere you can say “Jack Robinson.” Agib. Oh, p'raps he'll step this way. [Taking the hammer of gong in his hand, and about to strike. Zub. Don't! Gul. On your life! Agib. Your freedom to encompass! What's life?— Zub. You've no idea—the frightful rumpus!— Agib. (Pushing her away.) For all my hurts leave me to find a plaster; One! two! three!—bang! [He strikes the Talisman fiercely; it is shivered to atoms, making a frightful crash. At the same instant Jarjarhees appears, C. Zub. (Staggering with horror.) Oh! gracious goodness, master! [She attempts to conceal Agib behind her. Gul. We're lost! Jar. Now then! explain this strange hubbub; Bringing me hence thus early from my club. My magic gong in atoms!—death! Zub. Why—that— You see—an accident—in short—the cat! Jar. I smell a rat; no cat can be about— Agib. (Aside.) I've been and done it, that's beyond a doubt; 'Twas that champagne—I thought to stand a dozen. Jar. (Discovering Agib.) A man! Die, catiff! [Rushing at Agib, Zubeydeh throws himself between them. Zub. Mercy! He's my cousin! [Jarjarhees steps back, and trips over Codja, who has fallen drunk under the table. Codja. All right! Jar. Another 'neath my table sunk! [Shaking him by the shoulder. Codja. Don't! the hard-working woodcutter is drunk! Jar. A woodman here! this insult is immense; No doubt to take a chop at my expense, Sneak'd here his timber duties to evade— Codja. (Falling very flat.) Shocking depression in the timber trade! Jar. Who dared, within this magic-guarded place, Suffer this log to show his hatchet face? Codja. (Drowsily) Some green young faggots— Jar. What! my words d'ye mock? With thine own weapon— [Snatching the bill-hook which Agib has laid on the table, and aiming at Codja's head. Codja. Chip of the old block. [Agib stays his arm as he is about to strike. Agib. Stop! If there's any one to blame, 'tis I. Jar. Then I repeat my observation—die! Agib. Die! who's afraid, thou dark and fiendish elf? Say “die!”—it's what I never say myself. Gul. (Interposing.) No, pray say nothing of the sort at present! Jar. Thou lovest him? Gul. I own it. Jar. Come—that's pleasant. [He appears deeply affected. Be firm, Jarjarhees; certainly I will. (To Gul.) “Live you, the marble-breasted tyrant still;” But for your minion, whom I see you love— Whom into next week's central point I'll shove— Him will I change out of that cruel shape, Which you prefer to mine. (To Agib.) Become an ape! [Music. Agib disappears, and an Ape appears in his place. He runs about the stage in the deepest distress. Behold your love—a monster, dumb and grimy Zub. (Screams as the Ape approaches her.) I never could abide 'em! Don't come nigh me! Gul. Oh! horrid prospect! Jar. Eh! I call it prime; In that disguise, I hope he'll run some time. Gul. Monster! (The Ape appears distressed.) Not you, poor brute, would I be rude to; You're not the nasty beast that I allude to. [Looking pointedly at Jarjarhees. Jar. Ma'am? Gul. Hence! nor dare again to press your suit; I'd love him were he never such a brute, [The Ape kneels gratefully to her, taking her handkerchief from her, and kissing it. Hog, hippopotamus, or terrier-pup; Away! I spurn thee! To Ape.) Rise! [Raising him, and standing proudly by him. My monkey's up! Jar. (Furiously.) This is too much—to stop it we'll endeavour; Thus, loud-mouth'd girl, we shut you up for ever! [Music. A Rock, R. C., encloses Gulnare. The Ape runs towards it, and knocks his head against it. Jar. Breakers a-head! upon that fatal rock We both have split—recover from this shock I never shall; but as becomes my station, I'll try; by plunging into dissipation, The world shall feel, since by despair I'm druv, The terrors of a Genie cross'd in love. Thieves, burglars, swindlers, murderers, marauders, Who want an evil Genius, give your orders! First, of this scene of pleasures once so dear, Let ev'ry trace and relic disappear. [He sinks, and the scene disappears, changing to a sea shore view, giving the appearance of a desolate island. Rocks in the foreground—calm blue sea in the back. (L.) A bluff, similar to that in the “Green Bushes.” Codja remains on his back. (R.) Zub. Oh! day of horror! here's a transformation, To leave my place for such a situation; Fiend! Genie! demon! all thy terrors scorning, Where are my boxes and my monthly warning? Is't thus with thee a trusting maid engages? My luggage! oh, my notice, and my wages! [Running up to Codja, and shaking him. I say, look up to me—consider you Are all that's left for me to look up to. [The Ape touches her reproachfully on the shoulder. Paws off, you brute! and don't my shoulders maul, Your nasty monkey tricks have caused it all; [The Ape withdraws sorrowfully, and ascends a tree, R. waving Gulnare's handkerchief as if for help. We're on a desert island. Come, I say, Let's seek for some assistance? Codja. (Drunkenly.) What's to pay? Zub. To gather wool his little wits are going for. Codja. Some trifling breakages I think are owing for. Zub. I'll give up the attempt, though loth to do so; An unprotected Female Rob'son Crusoe. Here I must stay, though storms and tempests brewing. [The Ape breaks two branches from tree with a crash. Drat that mischievous monkey!—What's he doing? [The Ape descends tree hastily, seizes a dry log of wood, and leaps with that and the two branches into the sea (R.) disappearing. Zubeydeh looks after him. Zub. Why, the young jackanapes! he's got astride That log of wood! and paddles through the tide, With those two sticks showing a perfect knowledge Of both the branches of the Naval College; He guides his bark like any old sea-dog, And see how carefully he keeps his log! [Music—“The Jolly Young Waterman.” The Ape appears (R.) rowing in the manner described by Zubeydeh from R. to L. SONG.—Zebeydeh. The Jolly Young Waterman. Oh! did you e'er hear of a jolly young Waterman, Daring on such a frail vessel to ply; He'd better proceed with uncommon dexterity, Keeping his heart up and minding his eye, He can't be too quiet or row too steadily, Timbers like those might be shiver'd so readily, And if that young Waterman doesn't take care. He'll miscarry and never more want for a fare. [The Ape disappears behind cliff, L. He, too, deserts me! I can't wonder much, That, now he is a brute, he acts as such. Why do I pause? Quite obvious is my game, A mistress murder'd, or what's much the same. Alone!—at least (looking at Codja) I am alone—What's he? Only a sort of lone Society; A flood of mem'ries to my cranium rushes, Of Sappho and the lady in Green Bushes. Now, all you fairies and heroic he males, That live by rescuing despondent females, Here's a chance for you!—overboard I pop, And let my last act finish with a drop. Runs to top of cliff L., and leaps over. A galley appears L., manned with sailors, merchants &amp;c. The Ape on the rigging. He leaps into the water and rescues Zubeydeh, handing her up to the sailors. While they are taking her on board, he leaps ashore, seizes Codja on his back, and swims to the vessel with him. He is taken on board, and the Act closes to the music of the “Green Bushes.” END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE. I. —Public Place in Curripoudah (the capitol portion of Mulligatawney), in the vicinity of the Palace. Strangers in various costumes, with luggage, carpet bags, &amp;c., throng the stage. Men walking about with placards, such as “An excellent dust bin to let—rent 500 rupees a week;” “A commodious lamp post in the neighbourhood of the Exhibition, suitable for swinging a single or double hammock —rent moderate;” “A dog kennel for a single man— 200 rupees per week;” “Visitors to the Exhibition may be accommodated with well ventilated apartments in the Ball of the Grand Mosque,” &amp;c., &amp;c. CHORUS. “Bartlemy Fair.” What a bustle—it's too bad, Not a lodging to be had, Ev'ry nook and corner collar'd, Ev'ry bait to grab at swallow'd, Fill'd by foreigners erratic, Leaving not a single attic; Let alone a snug two pair, Oh! Britons here; Frenchmen queer; Cousins German; Turkish Firman; Yankees knowing, “Smartest going;” Poles and Dutchmen, Swedes and such men; Hey down! ho down! very, very brown, Are we done by this National Affair, Oh! Enter Cranbourn Ali (the Rajah); Dost Ymillah, Guards, &amp;c. &amp;c., L. Ali. Hence! home, ye idle varlets, get ye home; Is this a holiday, that thus ye roam, Disturbing, with your vile discordant shindies, One of the richest monarchs of the Indies? 1. Pleb. Dread Sir! our homes to move, we'd not be slow to, But the job is we can't find homes to go to. The town's so full, with visitors beset, There's not a single coal-hole to be let; And cow-house keepers for their stalls with hay for 'em, Demand so much we can't afford to pay for 'em; Each chimney pot has guests to dine or sup in it, And not a cab but has a bed made up in it. A good dry pigsty up a healthy court Fetches almost unheard of sums; in short, A saying old, on all sides meets the ear, “It's all very fine, Mr. Foreigner, but you don't lodge here.” Ali. Hence! get ye gone and seek some other quarter. To grumble in— [Plebeians exeunt. My daughter, Oh! my daughter! You've brought our city to a nice condition, All through your Grand Industrial Exhibition. Up in our Park, bestrewn with lime and planks, Masons, more free than welcome, play their pranks; And with whole droves of bricklayers thou pain'st us Whose “hods” are most decidedly against us. One of her whims!—whatever she thinks proper To do is done, and so we could'nt stop her. SONG. “When a man weds.” When a man's married, It's awkward to find That his daughter possesses A masculine mind; I've got one myself, Who's the plague of my life, And reminds me each day Of my poor deceased wife. Will of her own— Let her alone, All very pleasant and nice, Sirs; Thwart her at all— Out for a squall Look! for it comes in a trice, sirs. Notions new, Politics too, Edits the Voix des Femmes, sirs. Fond o' new lights, Woman's rights, Looks upon man as a sham, sirs. Spouting, flouting, scribbling, fribbling, Speeching, screeching, lecturing, hectoring, When a man's, &amp;c &amp;c. And then she's got ideas above her station, Through having had a fairy education— Her ma—to send her to—nought less would stand,— Than a crack boarding-school in Fairy-land; Where she learnt all the extras—magic—witchcraft— Clairvoyance—mesmerism—spells—and sich craft; The tricks she's up to really are alarming, Yet—hang it all—the jade! she's always charming. Good as she's elever—though she sometimes worries us, And faster than our usual slow pace hurries us; And but for good exerts her magic wiles, By far less dang'rous than her magic smiles, Which do much harm. Voices. (Outside.) Bal—loon! [Plebeians all enter L. Ali. What means that row? Dost. Sire! the Queen of Beauty's coming! Ali. How? Dost. In her new locomotive steam balloon. Ali. And you stand gaping there—slaves, change your tune! Are'nt you informed our conquering daughter comes? Sound—sound your trumpets, beat your Indian drums. CHORUS. “Fly not yet.” Raise your voices, one and all— “Long live the Queen of Beauty” bawl; All hail! and such like phrases sing; Huzzah! and all that sort of thing! Bal—loon! [They follow the balloon off, R. [Balloon crosses in the distance L. to R., with the paddles working. The Queen of Beauty in the car, with two Fairies, one of whom is steering. Queen of B. (Outside.) Half turn astern! Ease her! now, hard-a-port! Stop her! move her ahead! There that's your sort! [Enter with Fairies, R. Now, take it home—be careful how you go. Fairy. Feed it? Queen. Yes; half a sack of coke, or so, Give it some water, and rub down the car. Be off! [Exeunt Fairies, R. And, now to business. Hah! papa! Kiss! I can't stop. Ali. (Looking at her admiringly.) Where have you been so early? Queen. Not far; to Fairy-land—so don't be surly. Ali. To Fairy-land!—you are a one to go. What for? Queen. A thousand things! Ali. But let me know. Queen. Why, first to pass! Ali. Pass! What? Queen. The Magic College, The fairy hall of necromantic knowledge. All right! Ali. I'm glad to hear it. What though? Tell me. Queen. Got through triumphantly! they tried to sell m? Ali. Who? Queen. The Examiners. Ali. But say, what's selling? Queen. Oh! tried to dodge me in my magic spelling; Knew ev'ry meaning! Then they tried annoyance, Thinking I wasn't up in my clairvoyance; Saw through it, ev'ry bit—that wouldn't do: Then ask'd me if the bottle trick I knew— Did it before their eyes—quick! presto! Pass! Here's my diploma—Sprite of the First Class! [Shows diploma. Ali. Wonderful girl! Then now, of course, the fact is That you're a Fairy! Queen. Yes; and mean to practise. DUETT. “Valse D'Amour.” Queen. Yes, the great fairy guns, now I'm equal to— Ali. Don't say so! Queen. If you doubt it, my powers I'll test on you. Ali. Oh, dear no! Queen. Just let me. I'm sure you won't care, papa, For fun—it would so make them stare, papa. Transform you—say, into a bear, papa, Or something my powers to try— Ali. (Spoken—terrified.) Certainly not. Queen. A wolf, or an ass, just to show— It won't hurt, for a minute or so. Ali. (Spoken.) Take her away! Queen. Well, never mind; But I must say, you're very unkind! Just a moment, I so want to try. Ali. (Spoken.) Couldn't think of it. Queen. A racoon, or a nice Russian bear; Or a hog, with a fine head of hair! Ali. (Spoken.) Be quiet! Queen. Well, never mind, &amp;c. Queen. Well, I must go. [Crosses to L. Ali. But why this expedition? Stay! tell me how gets on your Exhibition? Queen. Why, I can't say as fast as I could wish it— An enemy does all he can to dish it, A Genie, Jarjarhees by name; who knows That, by its magic influence, I propose To crush some pow'rs he likes, but I abhor— Ill feeling, discord, prejudice, and war; And in their stead establish, 'twixt each nation, A peaceful kind of friendly emulation; The wretch does all he can my views to thwart, Brews storms to wreck my ships that come in port; Tears down my posters, and with fiendish malice Does all he can to smash my Crystal Palace! Ali. But sure your arts might break the rascal's bones! Queen. (Significantly.) Folks in glass houses oughtn't to throw stones. Yet, spite of him and all such critic cavillers, Our work gets on, astonishing the travellers— Who own, as rising to the clouds they view it, Magic, and magic pow'r alone, could do it. GRAND MEDLEY OF ALL NATIONS. “The Ties of Friendship.” The joists are up, the girders raised, and we Will shortly be prepared our friends to see; “Ching-a-ring-a-ring-ching.” Ching-a-ring-a-ring-ching-ching-ching-cha, Chinamen arrive from Pekin far; Ting-a-ring-a-ring-ting! there you are— Show your China mugs, nor fear a jar! “Paddy o'Flanagan.” Och! welcome to Paddy from Cork, With his national industry's sample; Though to speak of brave Paddy and “work,” In a breath, seems to bulls an example. But, put him once in the right way, And, for good, he'll be active and frisky; He'll prove the first “Gim of the say” Can produce something stronger than whiskey! Och! Paddy's a man again! Long badly-used Paddy. Och! och! och! Pat is a darling boy! “Portrait Charmant.” Portrait charmant—portrait de mon amie France! no more with stains of blood bedew'd. Ah! viens m'offrir—your hand in friendship glued, Nor save in arts of peace a rival be— Je vois encore votre rappelle à la vie! “German Air.” Leipsig, Brunschwig, Schleswig, Jarmany— Join your thousand tribes in harmony. Drop your noise, And like good boys, Just try who can make the best German toys! Sing, falla-tre! falla-tre, &amp;c. Let Discord's fume For Peace make room— Sweep troubles away with a German broom. “There are sax eggs in the pon', gude mon.” Hey! travel the seas beyond, gude mon! Since of leaving your hame ye're sae fon'; We've room a deal For the Lowland chiel, And room for the bra' John Hielandmon! “Yankee Doodle.” Yankee Doodle, come to town, Swell our demonstration; Smartest nation airth can boast, That whips the whole creation. But a coloured part of it, P'raps you whip too often: Not a bit less smart you'd seem, If their smarts you'd but soften. “Il segreto.” Il segreto per esser felice. Brave Italian! come here and we'll teach ye— With some efforts industrial content ye— And an end to your dolce far niente. “Home, sweet Home.” But whoe'er crowd our palace's transept and dome— We'll forget not that one spot to all Lands a Home. “Rule Britannia.” Rule Britannia! may Britain rule the waves, In peace as when war's tempest raves. But here I'm wasting time. [Going. Ali. Where goes my pretty? Queen. Where? why to take the chair—I'm on committee. [Exit L. Ali. Who wouldn't be a father! [A cry heard. Hah! who roar'd? Dost. It is the cry of women, good my lord. Enter Ameer Stikh. Ame. My lord, the Vizier's dead. Ali (dropping a sceptre, à la Macbeth.) Eh! dead? absurd— There would have been a time for such a word: But now to die, when so much work he'd got to Finish particularly!—Tell him not to. Att. Sire, he won't hear of it. Ali. With rage we burst! Treason has been and gone and done its worst. Here! we must have a Vizier—go and catch one! Buy one! send out!—Stay, take a cab and fetch one. Dost. I fear, sire, not a tradesman in the land Keeps an assortment, ready made, on hand. Ali. Then order one!—Stay: very likely, though, 'tis Hard to knock up one on so short a notice. Hold!—of a great idea we're on the brink— Yes! bring a table, paper, pens and ink, And place them there. Dost. Would our great king be arter Writing petitions for the People's Charter? Ali. Peace! [A table is brought, L., furnished as he requested. There's a science that we much delight in, Which tells folks' characters by their handwriting; We'll try it. Call our faithful subjects here: A show of hands shall choose us a vizier. One we must have, if only an apology— And what so good a test as Graphiology? Dost. Oh, yes! oh, yes! step forward please, draw near! Those who want places—Wanted, a Vizier! All applications to be made by letter, And those who don't do so at once had better. [Plebeians flock in during his speech. Ali. Go on—all write! [Pointing to table. [A Plebeian writes. Ali inspects his production. Why, this is past belief: This man's a swindler!—nay, a very thief! Pleb. Sire! Ali. Slave! thou hast not cross'd a single T. All I can say is—let him not cross me! [The Plebeian runs out frightened. Another writes. Ali inspects as before. No upright man would make such sloping y's, And there's a queer expression in his i's! [The second writer disappears like the first. Another writes. Ah! your orthography stands in your way— We don't spell Cranbourn Ali with a K. [Business repeated. Another writes. A composition in the Ragged school Who writes so crookedly can never rule. [Another writes. There, that'll do—on them we've wasted time enough: There's not one for a minister that's prime enough! With all that public press of men of mark, To think the crown should want an organ. Hark! [An organ is heard outside playing “Jeannette and Jeannot” very dolefully. Cranbourn Ali expresses excruciating agony at the sound. Dost. There's one, sire, with a boy in leather gaiters! [Tune increases in violence. Ali. (Holding his ears and writhing in agony.) Not that sort! worst of all peace devastators! [Tune very loud indeed. We cannot bear it!—Ease him! back him! stop him! Drag him before us! seize him! whack him! whop him! [Guards rush out, and are heard struggling with Codja and Zubeydeh. Zub. (Outside.) You let us go! Guard. (Ditto.) Bring in the baggage! Codja. (Ditto) Ah, no! [Guards rush in dragging in Codja, Zubeydeh, and the Ape. Codja is dressed in a broad-brimmed felt hat and goiters as an Italian boy, and carries a barrel-organ. Zubeydeh with a silk handkerchief on her head like a Savoyard girl. She carries a tambourine. She clings to Codja with one hand and with the other holds a chain, to which the Ape is attached, dressed in a red jacket and cap and feather, after the fashion of monkeys connected with promenade concerts. Codja. (Falling on his knees to Ali.) Pieta, Signori—povero 'Taliano! Ali. Pooh! that tune won't do here— Codja. (Aside.) It won't? The deuce! We thought to find it of the greatest use When we embraced the musical profession. (Aside to Zub) Dodge Number One don't answer—try a fresh 'un. Zub. (To Ali.) Oh! spare a wand'ring artist and his wife Just married, struggling to get on in life, To scrape enough to buy some white mice creeping, And a few guinea-pigs towards housekeeping. Codja. Do! Ali. Caitiff, hast thou not the world annoy'd, The peace of thousand families destroy'd? Hast not their comfort at defiance set, Taunting them with “We may be happy yet?” Scared happiness from many lowly walls, With dreams of having dwelt in Marble Halls? Zub. But still to make amends we're always willing, Let us move on—we will— Codja. Under a shilling! Ali. Whence came ye? Zub. It's a long and painful story, Ali. Tell it, and we may pardon— Codja. Si signori! [Zubeydeh takes her tambourine and sings to its accompaniment. Codja plays the organ. The Ape moves slowly round to the tune. SONG. Zubeydeh. “Jenny Jones.” Our name's on the organ, we live by its melodies, In the daily pursuit of our lodging and meals; Thrown on the wide world and compell'd to provide for An only baboon with the saddest of tales. And indeed of all creatures devoted and dutiful, That little monkey we prize far above; For indeed in our hearts, that small ring tailed monstrosity, Convinced of his “valley,” in truth we do love. [Codja plays symphony. The Monkey begs of Cranbourn Ali with his cap in his mouth. He started in life with the brightest of prospects, Till things took a turn, and he met a reverse; And now he's cut down to mere monkey's allowance— Reduced by a change than all robbery worse. And to save him from kicks, and supply him with halfpence, Through city and valley and mountain we rove: And indeed all our arts it requires to provide him With sweet ginger cakes and the nuts which he loves. [The Ape kneels to Cranbourn Ali, kissing his robe. Ali. Wonder! we scarce can credit what we see. Rise, loyal monkey! Codja. Why, the fact is, he Has travelled much—has often been at court— A monkey who has seen the world, in short. [The king weeps. Dost. Our monarch weeps! Ali. Excuse this furtive tear— He so reminds us of our lost vizier. Such was his attitude ere grim death dish'd him— So would he dance to any tune we wish'd him; Thus, hat in hand, he went, by no means proud, For us extracting coppers from the crowd. He was a man! his like we seek in vain— We ne'er shall look upon sich like again! Codja. Hopeless? Ali. Completely! Numbers have applied, Whose powers by their caligraphy we've tried On yonder desk; but none of them could trace Characters good enough for such a place. [The Ape tries to break away from Zubeydeh, and run towards writing-table. Zub. Jacko! come here! (Ape breaks away from her.) He's off like any rocket. Codja. He smells some gingerbread in some one's pocket. Zub. Oh, dear! he'll get us into dreadful scrapes! Warning to all young women—don't lead apes! [The Ape tries to get at the table; Guards keep him off. He comes forward, and explains by signs that he wishes to write. Ali. Explain what all that antic frisk and hop is. Codja. My liege, I think, he's setting round-hand copies. Ali. He wants to write! Give way, there, guards and flunkies! Zub. He'll spill the ink. Codja. Stuff! Zub. Monkeys will be monkeys! [The Ape makes absurd preparations for writing: looks at nib of pen, &amp;c., and commences writing. Ali. To credit this we all our faith must summon. Codja. Talk about comic writers!—there's a rum un! [The Ape pauses, and scratches his head. Ali. Why does he pause with knit and thoughtful brow? Codja. He's waiting for a rhyme— [The Ape having finished his operations, re-commences writing. He's got it now! [Ali, Zubeydeh, Codja, and Dost look over in breathless interest. Ali. He dots his I's— Dost. And minds his P's and Q's— Ali. Great A's— Zub. Superior T's— Codja. Capital U's! [Ape gives paper to Ali, and the attendant removes table, &amp;c. CONCERTED. “Cease your sunning.” Ali (looking at the Ape's writing.) Cease your punning! This is stunning! Not gold pens and best japan, With the blessings Of “six lessings,” Could surpass it! He's our man! Zub. 'Tis most certing, Scribes diverting Of the monkey tribe are known; Mouthing, jibbing; Always cribbing Goods from others, not their own. Ali (reads). “Agib is my proper name, Distant is my nation: This comes hoping I may suit The Vizier's situation.” Suit! such a brilliant hand we really never!— Proclaim as our vizier this monkey clever! Codja. Stop! as his friends, his interests we must see to: We wish to know what terms you would agree to. Ali. Say twenty pounds a week—of cake—for salary— Zub. And in the house the free run of the gallery? Ali. Granted. Zub. Of chesnuts once a month a full sack? Codja. Snug quarters? Ali. We'll promote him to the woolsack, And of the Woods and Forests make him free. Codja. Once there, he'll soon get to the top o'th'tree. Zub. At least six cats in waiting he'll require, With paws to take his chesnuts from the fire. Ali. They of our civil list shall swell the book. Zub. Pull down the bill—the Vizier's place is took. Ali. Bring forth the robes of office! Codja (detaining him). Stop! don't go, man. Ali. Anything else? Codja. A trifle for the showman. [Touching his hat. Ali. True—you shall serve him with his currant-buns, As Master of the Rolls, and Sally Lunns! (To Zub.) And you, as Mistress of the Robes shall care, To keep his monkey-jackets in repair. Now, sound! et cetera, and throughout the nation Chair him, and of our choice make proclamation. [All shout. [Attendants bring in a robe of office, in which they clothe the Ape, who is hoisted upon the shoulders of Guards. The characters form a procession, Zubeydeh and Codja taking the lead. CHORUS. “Sturm March Galop.” Zub. (Dancing before the procession with tambourine.) Jacko's now in clover. Cymbals bang, Chorus. Hurrah! Zub. Thump the drums, and let the trumpets clang! Chorus. Hurrah! Jacks in office are these—yes, a gang, Chorus. Hurrah! Greater brutes than our orang-outang! Chorus. Hurrah! Monkey tricks we often see, In the best society; Why then heed his monkey shape, He'll his better's manners ape! Thump then the drums, and cymbals clang, Sound the martial trumpets, let the cannon bang, Shout long life to our orang-outang! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Jacko's now in clover, &amp;c. [Exeunt, U. E. L. Scene II. —The Queen of Beauty's Sanctum Sanctorum. Enter the Queen of Beauty and Fairy Attendants, some carrying papers. Queen. Bring me some more reports! I'll read them all, Till St. John's Wood remove to dark Blackwall. I'll not give in! What's the fiend Jarjarhees? Who cares for him and all his nasty tease. Enter a Fairy (R.) hastily. Hedge nettles flog thy back! thou snail-paced loon Why trott'st thou thus, goose—look! [Showing a watch. It's long past noon! Fairy. There are ten thousand— Queen. Geese, silly? Fairy. Letters! Queen. Slattern! Go prick thy thumbs, and spoil thy crochet pattern, Thou Liliputian girl! What letters, Patch? Fairy. English. Queen. Begone! We'll come and read the batch? [Exit Fairy, R. Hang those that talk of bed! Fatigue I scout, I'll work till from my hair the curl comes out. Sweetlips! Enter another Fairy, L. Fairy. Your gracious pleasure? Queen. What news more? Fairy. The glaziers strike for wages— Queen. That's a bore! His doing! Never mind, let more be found; Send out more posters—skir the country round. [Exit Fairy, L. The opposition presses rather thickly, Enter Ameer Stikh. Thou com'st to use thy tongue—thy story quickly! Ame. Gracious my lady! Queen. Well? Ame. I shall report That which I say I saw, but didn't ought. I look'd from out the Building—and methought The Park began to move! Queen. Story and crammer! Ame. It proved to be a Yankee panorama Two hundred miles in length! They claim admission, As their donation to the Exhibition! Queen. We have supp'd full of horrors—don't suppose We've room to go such dreadful lengths as those. Take thy face hence! [Exit Ameer Stikh, R. 'Tis madness what they ask— I 'gin to be a weary of my task. This fiend's annoyances will never end— Enter a Fairy Porter (L.) with a box. Now then! Porter. My liege, “a trifle from Gravesend.” Queen. Off with its head! what it contains, let's see. [The box is opened, a bottle labelled “British Brandy” produced. Queen reads a paper attached to it. “A specimen of British industry!” Faugh! British brandy! this is far too much, Throw physic to the dogs! I'll none of such. [Throws bottle away violently. [Exit Porter. I pall in resolution, and begin To doubt my powers—still, I'll not give in. Bring my charm'd armour, and my strongest wand— Of special sylphs swear in an extra band. Give every magic engine constant oiling, And keep each single charm-ed pot-a-boiling! SONG. “Ole Zip 'Coon.” Come bustle, rustle, tustle! set each charm a-going soon, Much bus'ness must be done—upon the corner of the moon There hangs a mist profound.—Just catch it; take our best balloon, The building must be finish'd by to-morrow arternoon. Mever mind your Sunday wings, Nor your fairy gems and rings; I'll pay for all the damage done your pretty muslin things, And if you're good, when finish'd you shall have a moonlight ball, With honey combs and mountain dew sufficient for you all. Zippy, zippy, zippy, zippy, zippy, nooden nay, Zippy, zippy, zippy, zippy, zippy, nooden nay; Zippy, nooden, nooden, nooden, set about it soon, The building must be finished by to-morrow arternoon! This push will cheer me, or unseat me, quite. [Loud laughter, shouting, and ordnance heard outside, R. Now, what's all that? Att. The king doth wake to-night. Queen. Wake! I should think he did, and keeps his rows, But still he needn't wake th'entire house; Our parent seems 'gainst decent rules a sinner— What is the row? Att. 'Tis an election dinner! A new Vizier!— Queen. We've something of it heard, But hadn't time to listen to a word. Enter Dost Ymillah, R. Dost. May your mellifluence live a thousand years! The Rajah's compliments, and the Vizier's, And could you lay aside your witch'ry's power, And shut your magic shop up for an hour, And join them at dessert—it's just brought on! Queen. Our compliments, and say we won't—begone! [Exit Dost Ymillah. We've got too big, when people come to dine, To be ask'd in to take a glass of wine. Enter Cranbourn Ali R., considerably sprung, his turban very much on one eye, and his hands in his pockets. Ali. I—say—do—come! Queen. Now, pa! dear! what a state! Before one's fairies, too! (To Attendants.) Absquatulate! [Fairies vanish R and L. I, who've on Exhibitions spent such pelf, To see my father make one of himself! In your position, too—you really oughtn't! Ali. We couldn't help it, that's the long and short on't; That Vizier! he's the drollest dog—at least Not dog— Queen. Why not? No doubt a perfect beast! Ali. But still he's tip-top company—that's certain; Just see him scramble up the window-curtain! Queen. The window-curtain! Ali. Yes; or take the chair, And stand upon his head on it—it's rare! Or stuff his cheeks with nuts and apples, quite full— Such an amount of cheek is quite delightful! Queen. Why, what strange animal have you employ'd? Ali. A wild young monkey! Queen. What? Ali. Don't be annoy'd That a four-handed Vizier serves your father; Doesn't he play four-handed cribbage! rather! Queen. A monkey—speak! what sort? Ali. He seems to me Between a Ringtail and a Chimpanzee, Could he but speechify—he almost sang— I should pronounce him a harangue outang! Queen. (Aside.) A learned ape! No doubt the very prince, Changed by my foe, Jarjarhees, some time since; If so, a settlement with him I'll make, And his change out of that he'll have to take! Enter Codja, extravagantly dressed, R. Codja. I say, come on, old boy, the bottle stands, The Vizier don't—he scarce can keep his hands! [Trying to pull Ali away Ali. (To Queen.) Do come! Queen. I really want to see the rarity! Ali. Make us some coffee— Queen. (Looking at them.) It would be a charity. Ali. He's not particular, so drop all shyness. Queen. I'll follow you— Ali. (Going with Codja.) That's right! [A terrific smash, as of breaking glass is heard. Codja. (In extacies.) Hark at his Highness! [Exeunt Ali and Codja, arm-in-arm. Queen. Revenge! and so forth—if I have got hold of The monkey that my magic arts have told of, As I suspect. This Genie fiend, who dares, To my annoyance, thus to show his airs, Quick to the right about dismiss'd shall be, With, in his ear, the most industrious flea That my Industrial Exhibition boasts of— Nor left with chances of escape the ghosts of! SONG. “Barclay and Perkins's Drayman.” Near Southwark bridge, on the Surrey side, An example, not very far back, men Have set us to punish dark spirits, who've tried To persecute women, and rack men; And this grim fiend shall find ere long, To their principles I say, A-men; I'll plague him with spirits as earnest and strong As Barclay and Perkins's Draymen! [Exit SCENE 3. —The Rajah's Snuggery in the Palace. A Persian carpet, (C.) with drinking materials, lights, hookahs. &amp;c. Cranbourn Ali, (R.) Codja, (L.) Dost Ymillah, (L.) and the Ape (R.) discovered forming a symposium in an advanced state of festivity. They are seated at first, and sing uproariously the following. CHORUS. Oh, vive l'amour! cigars and cogniac! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! of these we'll have our whack. [They repeat the Chorus, joining hands, and dancing round extravagantly. Enter the Queen of Beauty, L. Queen. My masters, are ye mad? [They stop their uproar. The Ape makes a respectful obeisance. (Coughing.) Oh! Faugh! What smokers! One's suffocated by these bird's-eye chokers. Ali. Clean glasses and a pipe! Codja. Somehow I feel As if each boot had a revolving heel! Unjustly they with chains Galileo bound— I feel he spoke the truth—the world goes round! Ali. (Presenting Ape to Queen of Beauty.) Allow me to present to you my treasure— The friend I named. Queen. (Curtseying.) I think I have pleasure To know the gentleman. Ali. You know him? Queen. Yes; And all about him. [Crosses to R. Ali. Then we must confess, With consternation and with wonder great, You've form'd some odd acquaintances of late, Which ought to be inquired into. Queen. Well— Inquire away, your fears I'll soon dispel, You're right though, people to interrogate, Who come in such a questionable state. SONG. “Dear Sir, this brown Jug.” 1. Dear sir, this brown mug that now grins like a male Cheshire cat, and this form too, by which hangs a tale, Was once the Prince Agib, a dashing young man As e'er crack'd a joke or a bailiff outran, In fighting or flirting he'd always excel, He would pull down the knocker or bear off the bell. 2. It chanced that a Genie him trespassing found, In a magical arbour he'd built underground. He was vex'd that he'd found out his covert so snug, So, out of Prince Agib's he form'd this brown mug. Now retaining his liking for mirth and mild ale, He drinks like a Lord, though an Ape with a tale. Ali. That girl knows ev'rything. Queen. Your eyes on me, Just keep, and you shall see what you shall see. Ali. What would you do? Queen. Do! make him a new man. Set him once more on his own legs— Ali. You can? Queen. You'll see; Ali. Impossible. Queen. Dispel your fears; I've had experience now for some few years In Fairy matters, and I think you'll own, In the most trying situations known. With ogres, giants, monsters, oft in action, I've generally given satisfaction. Whenever fortune has provided such for me, You ought to know, they've never proved too much for me. Ali. True, I was wrong to doubt your pow'rs, my daughter, Who've seen what you can do? Queen. A glass of water! Dost Ymillah presents her with a glass of water; she performs magical gesticulations over it. Ali. What is she after? Codja. I'm inclined to think She's hocus pocussing the monkey's drink. INCANTATION. Queen. Sprites, of Fairy land the flower, Lend a friend your magic power! Sprites who lavish'd long ago, Fortune on Fortunio; Gentle sylphs, who don't forget All the claims of Percinet; Guardians of the Minstrel boy, Golden Lucidora's joy; Airy forms that used to wander, Watching o'er unseen Leander; Light and gauzy Peri clan, Friends to Camaralzaman; Aid, with all your powers, one Who her best for you has done. [Approaching the Monkey with water, she sings Air, “Off she goes.” Dumpey monkey! hairy and small, Dumpey monkey's had a great fall; But all the king's horses and all the king's men Shall see me soon set him up again. “All the blue bonnets.” March! march! dog face and little tail, All traces of the Simiadæ order; Let his paws vanish, and nose be divested of All the blue on its queer edges and border. Now stand at ease! Attention! As you were! I'll quickly make you—Presto! Change! [Jarjarhees outside roars through speaking trumpet Beware! Queen. Don't be alarmed, such hollow tricks we're used to From those who have their fellow-men reduced to The level of the brutes. Whene'er they see Any attempt the poor dark things to free From their captivity, by arts enlighten'd And make them Human Beings, they get frightened. And in the steps of light and science prowl, Trying to stop it by some wretched howl. [Music and thunder. Jarjarhees appears wearing a lion's head and roaring. Ali, Codja, &amp;c., appear frightened. (To Characters.) You needn't go. Who minds his senseless din? We know what creature wears the lion's skin! Thou wear a lion's skin! Doff it, for shame, And hang a calf-skin— Jar. Thank you all the same. [Running at her with his mouth open. We'll try—which to be the best man can boast. Queen. I'm told I make as good a man as most. Jar. You have no weapon, and perforce must suffer, Queen. You'll find you're playing with edged tools, my buffer! [She stamps and waves her hand. A scimitar with the wings and head of a dove flies in—she catches it. Opens a parasol, which forms a shield. DUETT. “Olga Waltz.” [The Queen of Beauty follows Jarjarhees round the stage, attacking him with scimitar. Queen. Now mind your evil eye, sir, Tremble! despair! and die, sir! Out of your hide a rise, sir, Soon I'll be taking! Jar. (Roaring as she hits him.) Oh! Queen. There's one for you— Jar. Oh! Queen. A stun for you— Jar. Oh! Queen. I've done for you! Jar. Oh! [Jarjarhees runs out (L.) yelling in extreme agony, the Queen of Beauty following attacking him. Cranbourn Ali, Codja, Dost Ymillah, and the Ape press forward, as if watching the fight. Ali. Go it, my beauty! Codja. Anybody bet? Dost. Ten to one on the Curripoudah pet! Ali. The Genie's getting “groggy” very fast, Dost. He comes up “piping,” Codja. Now he's “heav'ly grass'd!” Dost. Behold! she plants “a mouse” beneath his eye, Ali. And now she's got his head “in chancery!” Codja. It's off! Ali. What's off? Codja. The Genie's head! Dost. But, see, He's changed into an eagle— Ali. So has she! [Music. An eagle flies across the stage (L. to R.,) followed by another, in hot chase. Codja. At him again, he's got no friends. [A loud mewing and spitting is heard outside (R.) Ali. What's that? Dost. I never! Codja. What? Dost. He's changed into a cat! Ali. And see! my child becomes a wolf—all right! [Crowing of a cock. Dost. And now, a cock! Codja. Pooh! pooh! that cock won't fight. Ali. To try foul play I'm sure she never wishes, Dost. They're changed again! Ali. Ye, gods! Codja. To little fishes! Dost. All goes on swimmingly! Ali. To fishes! gammon! Codja. It's true—the cock has changed to a cock salmon. [Loud reports of crackers, &amp;c. Red fire (R.) Dost. See, now they fight with fire! Ali. 'Tis past endurance, Why that's the very height of Fire Assurance! [Jarjarhees runs in divested of lion's head (L.), with a cracker tied to his tail, &amp;c. The Queen of Beauty after him with a squib. Daughter, you'll burn your fingers. Go—retire! You naughty girl! how dare you play with fire! Queen. Look in his face, papa, and say if I Am not quite right to treat him as a Guy? [Jarjarhees falls on trap Jar. Quarter! Queen. Not half a quarter! Jar. Mercy! Queen. None! Jar. Once! twice! the third time! Going! going!—Gone! [A loud explosion. Jarjarhees falls rapidly through trap. Red fire. Ali. He went off with a bang! Queen. Yes, pa, and so did Many a humbug, now like him exploded. Humbugs and errors that in every day Have o'er the world established their dark sway Science attacks them—then a blaze—a roar— A struggle brief—a smoke—and all is o'er. Warm work, though—wasn't it? Ali. It was. But see— She's out of breath. Take heart! Codja. She wants a knee. [Ali supports her on his knee, Codja holds smelling bottle to her nose. Dost Ymillah fans her. Queen. There, that's enough! of adverse pow'r divested, Virtue and self can work on unmolested; (To Ape.) Come, be a man! No more that form retain, Monkeys avaunt! Agib's himself again! [Throws water on Ape, who disappears. Agib appears in his place. Ali. What do I see? My grand Vizier! Codja. My 'prentice! Agib. Am I awake, and really compos mentis? Queen. You are! Agib. My gratitude to prove, I'm seeking For words, but really so unused to speaking I've been these few months, it's no easy matter. Queen. Well, as you're not a monkey now, don't chatter. I've not done all I mean for you, e'en yet, The princess from enchantment free I'll set, Now that my adversary's power's diminish'd. Enter a Fairy. How now? Fairy. The palace! Queen. Well, what of it? Fairy. Finish'd! Queen. The factious opposition floor'd—I knew it. Come, one and all—it's glass—so let's look through it! Or stay! I'll call it to you. Ali. I've strong fears The house won't hear you, Queen. Why not? Walls have ears. Approach! [The scene changes to the Interior of the Crystal Palace, discovering Gulnare supported by Fairies, &amp;c. Ali. My stars! Codja. My eyes! Queen. My Crystal Palace spacious! Gal. (To Agib.) My lord! Agib. My life! Gul. My love! Agib. My duck! Enter Zubeydeh. Zub. My gracious! Queen. Hey day! my patience! do respect it, pray; My work is done—I've just one word to say, It is to you—(To Audience.) I beg, with all submission, To ask you how you like our Exhibition? We leave it in your hands, with one short pray'r— Deal gently with it—mind! it's “Glass, with care!” We've got our Crystal Palace finish'd, yet There's a donation we from you would get; Say, to the produce here of Foreign Lands, Will you just add the work of British hands? [Indicates clapping. FINALE, and general Dance of the Characters. Tune,—“Sir Roger de Coverley.” Queen. Then may we hope, e'er breaking up— Ali. You'll the matter taking up— Queen. Aid our endeavours, a jovial Christmas party in making up. Zub. Don't be too hard on us pray! Codja. Pieta Signori, I cry again! Zub. And if we've been wanting to-day, Allow us to-morrow to try again. Agib. Grant your smiles so flattering— Dost. Else our hopes all shattering— Gul. I'd rather be buried again— Agib. And I a monkey chattering. Queen. Though I can genies subdue— Ali. And dark spirits make ev'ry hour less— Queen. Unless I prevail, too, with you, I feel I am utterly powerless. Chorus. Then may we hope, e'er breaking up, &amp;c. Time of Representation, One Hour und Forty Minutes.</field>
