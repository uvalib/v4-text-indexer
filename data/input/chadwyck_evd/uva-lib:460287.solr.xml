      <field name="fulltext">Raro antecedentem scelestum Deseruit pede pÅna claudo. HOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. WRITTEN BY JOHN TAYLOR, ESQ. AND SPOKEN BY MR. HOLMAN. 'Tis held that Pleasure rules this laughing age, And Mirth has so monopolized the Stage, That poor Melpomene in vain may swell With rending woes, and direful stories tell, No drops of kindred grief resistless start, No sob responsive soothes her bursting heart, Her sportive Sister reigns despotic here, And if ye weep, Joy claims th' ecstatic tear. If so, our Bard, alas! in luckless hour, Has rashly try'd the scene's pathetic pow'r; Critics perchance will scowl with fierce disdain, Or giddy Fashion mock the tender strain. But sure 'tis slander, Britons still can feel, Still judge our efforts with impartial zeal, Whether we frolic with the jocund Muse, Or nobler strains of sacred sorrow chuse. Let but Desert expand its dawning beam Or on the sprightly, or the mournful theme, And British sympathy shall still supply Mirth's loudest roar, or Pity's tend'rest sigh; Whether one spark of true poetic fire Has touch'd our timid Poet's trembling lyre; Whether he faintly gleam with borrow'd rays, Or show at times, perhaps, a native blaze, From your august award must soon appear, Which he, alas! awaits with boding fear: Yet sure no harsh decree we need presage, From taunting fashion, or from critic rage; For since his cause by Englishmen is try'd, The sentence must incline to Mercy's side. And if the drooping Minstrel of to-night Has struck the melancholy chords aright; If, while he fondly pours the plaintive line, He aims to sadden only to refine; If, true to Nature, Nature must prevail, Each heart will soften with the melting tale; And own, as once the sage Enthusiast Pope. sung, Whose moral Harp the raptur'd Muses strung, âThe broadest mirth unfeeling Folly wears, âLess pleasing far than Virtue's very tears.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Don GUZMAN (Duke of Alba) Mr. Farren. Count LORENZO, Mr. Holman. Don FABIO (Father of Seraphina) Mr. Harley. GARCIAS (Friend of Lorenzo) Mr. Davies.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE, A Hall in the Duke of Alba's Palace. Enter Seraphina and Guzman. GUZMAN. Subdue this silent languishment, these tears, Which vainly rising to your eye-lids, fall Back on the heart, as wanting pow'r to flow. Does it become the Duke of Alba's wife, Pale, and dejected, thro' the Court of Spain, To glide a with'ring phantom, and controul Each festive scene with sullen melancholy? SERAPHINA. Alas! my lord! the temper of the mind Cannot be chang'd by effort, else the smile Should dwell for ever on my cheek, this brow Should still be jocund as a vernal morn; But with affections different, nature moulds Her pliant creatures. If in yon blue vault, She bids the early lark exulting sing, She also teaches the poor nightingale Retired amongst the shelter'd groves of eve, To trill the tones of sorrow. GUZMAN. But answer, Seraphina, did I not Raise you from fallen fortune, take your hand Amidst the desolation that weigh'd down Your father's former greatness? 'Tis to me He owes his present proud prosperity, And a kind monarch's uncondition'd favour; Then shall not gratitude at least repay?â SERAPHINA. Whoe'er, my lord! bestows his bounty, merely To purchase gratitude, deserves it not; But noble minds receive their great reward, When those they benefit are render'd happy. GUZMAN. Do not full coffers of Peruvian gold Wait your disposal, and Golconda's gems Offer their lustre to adorn your charms? And if you choose, amidst the gorgeous scenes Of Spain's magnificence, to vaunt your splendour, Who shall compare with Alba's lovely lady? SERAPHINA. Your rank, your rich possessions, and high state, Never allur'd my heart, nor can they gain it. A hapless, tho' a rigid parent's sufferings, To me were strong persuasions, forc'd me first To listen to your vows, and then receiveâ GUZMAN. Myself and my advantages, I find, Were then to thee, but unimportant objects. SERAPHINA. O! I had wish'd to dedicate my days To pray'r and penitence; the pealing choir Of holy maidens, and the convent's gloom, Had suited well my soul, so had I paid, Without a pang, my debt of gratitude To heav'n, for having veil'd me from the world. GUZMAN. Nor is it gratitude alone I seek, But more, demand affection as my right; Then do not thus disturb my doubtful heart, With wild discourse of strong persuasions urg'd;â E'en at the sacred altar you have sworn To yield to me your duty and your faith. SERAPHINA. To be the Duke of Alba's faithful wife, I swore, and such I am, and such will be: O you have all my faith, but for my love, Did I not tell you at that solemn hour, When, spite of my reluctance and entreaties, You seiz'd your prey, did I not then declare, With trembling tongue, I had no love to give? GUZMAN. Think you, I knew so little of your sex, To heed a timid maiden's supplications, Not to enforce what most she surely wishes. You all accept the nuptial wreath, with look Of winning bashfulness; but then, I deem, 'Tis eager passion paints the glowing cheek, And not the blush of artless modesty. SERAPHINA. Your thoughts indeed, and mine, cannot accord, But sentiments opposing, counteract That union which religion's laws have sanction'd; Such is my language of sincerity! I promise, therefore, Guzman! much to honor, And to obey you trulyâfor the restâ Heaven pardon me, the Will muste'er be free! GUZMAN. This frank avowal of essential failing, Shall not avail you, Madam! Nor will I, Your rightful lord, content me with obedience. Prepare to conquer your too stubborn purpose, And learn to meet my wishes with affection, Or by yon orb that fires the western sky, You soon, like his proud beams, shall set in darkness. SERAPHINA. O, whither shall I turn for peace or pity? GUZMAN. What, have I torn my laurels from the brow Of bleeding danger, in the thickest fight, To have them blighted by a woman's frown; And shall I, practis'd in the seemly arts Of polish'd life, with ev'ry youthful grace To win attention from the courtly fair; Shall I, submissive, meet your cold disdain, And own myself unworthy to be lov'd? Hither your father comes, let him approve This base, injurious scorn. Enter Fabio. GUZMAN. From you, Don Fabio! E'en in your worst adversity, I took Your daughter as my pledge of future friendship. FABIO. It is most true; and gratefully remember'd. GUZMAN. I have perform'd my part, and now you stand In the first circle of our king's esteem; But she, for whom I toil'd to reinstate you, And bade you triumph o'er a host of foes, Yes, she with open candour, boasts to hate me. FABIO. Your words convert attention to amazement. GUZMAN. I am, it seems, of an unpleasant aspect, Of manners coarse, and void of qualities To make impression on her nice discernment. Now let the mildew of opprobrious shame, Wither my full-blown glories, if I bear The foul reproach. FABIO. Daughter! I cannot brook This vile debasement of my friend, or suffer That it should pass as proof of filial duty. SERAPHINA. O, do not further irritate the Duke By wrong discoursings! Cast a pitying eye On your own child, your duteous Seraphina; And let the supposition of that woe, Which feeds upon her heart-strings, intercede To soften your displeasure.â FABIO. A curse upon the hour which gave thee birth, The measure of my woes was not complete 'Till that untoward time; I know thee, traitress! Thou art more various than the shifting gale, Deceitful as the surface of the deep! SERAPHINA. A father's mercy surely might conceal My errors, rather than thus magnifyâ But nature has no voice to plead for me! FABIO. Rouze up your flagging spirit, let her find You can command; a husband ne'er should sigh Like the wan suitor;âlaugh at her caprice; 'Tis but some momentary rage, which hangs On her vain heart, some secret jealousy Of beauty more admir'd, or sense superior. SERAPHINA. O, faithless exposition! cruel censure! GUZMAN. E'en now with less humility than sarcasm, Her tongue explain'd 'twas for your sake alone, She condescended to bestow her charms On one so undeserving of the favour. FABIO. Despise the fallacy of female words, Which simulate, and boast conceptions foreign From the soul's meaning. When you came to woo her, You may remember how she seem'd to shun Ev'ry endearment offer'd, and repress Your ardent hopes by frigid inattention. GUZMAN. The recollection stings me at this moment, And re-excites my then conceal'd vexation. FABIO. No sooner had you left her, than her tongue Would tire itself discoursing in your praise; As, âwhat a gallant gentlemen he is, âSo comely, and so courteous, do you think âI am his best belov'd, speak, dearest father!â And then, poor soul, she'd weep, and then again Descant in honor of your mind and person, Till my cloy'd ear was weary. GUZMAN. Can it be? SERAPHINA. Ah! mock me not thus fatally, nor thus Deceive my lord; but with a true endeavour Expatiate on the trouble of that time. When first the Duke assail'd me with his sighs, And in proud preference distinguish'd me; While you, with no benign observance paid To my despair, ordain'd I must be his. Have I not wander'd from the sad abode, Which then gave shelter to our humbled state, When the swift stream from Albarazin's hills, Was driv'n by stormy midnight to the plain, And there, in solitude, indulg'd my grief? Or when the summer's Sun in the red East, Gather'd his burning arrows, have you not Found me low leaning o'er the chrystal source, Where infant Tagus from his flow'ry bed Leaps into life; have you not found me there, Freighting his early voyage with my tears? From you, the inmost secrets of my heart Were never yet conceal'd, and can you urge That it was a Guzman I ador'd? GUZMAN. Ha! then Some happier mortal, some insidious knave! With oily tongue, and delicate demeanour, Had won the affection which I might not merit. For him you trod the dreary vale, and told Low-whisper'd sorrows to the sickly moon. 'Tis well disclos'dâYour coldness I could brook, But that another should usurp my place, In your soul's wishes, honest pride disdains. SERAPHINA. Be tranquilliz'd, my Lord, there is no other. GUZMAN. Perchance the adventurous hero now aspires To Guzman's wife, O speak it if he should, And tho' to shun my furious indignation, He fly to central Pyrennean caves, And herd with wolves, e'en there my sword shall reach him. SERAPHINA. Let not the teeming of an anxious brain, Produce undue suspicion, for I swear No man alive shares Seraphina's love.â Then grant this last indulgence, suffer me In decent privacy, and calm retirement, To pass a life which is estrang'd from joy, Which hope no more can flatter; so will I Pour with unceasing fervour the pure pray'r For endless blessings on you. GUZMAN. Hereafter I'll consider the request. [Exit Seraphina. FABIO. And are we made, then, of such poor materials, That the most noble natures may be shaken From their consistence, by each operation Of feminine pretext? I've heard thee mention'd As firm in council; and wide-sounding fame Has told of spirited encounters, where Thy neighing courser, mid th' embattled ranks, Bore a true hero, and thy reeking sword, Fell with a God's displeasure; but I find These were, alas! but vain and idle rumours; This hero, and this god, created merely By the vile breath of unsubstantial praise.â Shame, shame, my Lord, be worthier of thyself! GUZMAN. Be then my monitor, for the cool blood, Investigates the mode, and rectitude, That may bring 'vantage, while deceitful passion, Is but an Ignis-fatuus to the mind, And with a blazing, desperate allurement, Leads us away far from our proper path, To the unthought-of, fatal precipice. FABIO. Should you assume a sportive gallantry, Lavish encomium on some other Fair, And breathe with transport a fictitious fondness: No more solicitous, if Seraphina Be adverse or propitious; should you meet her With exhibition of adopted scorn, She'd soon become as amorous as the dove, That with unwearied wing pursues its mate. GUZMAN. Shall I then practise mean dissimulation, To win her slow avowal of regard? Perish the rash proposalâNo, she pray'd For solitude's seclusion, and I'll grant it; Then let her pine, and wonder at my absence; Yet, art thou sure in my surmise alone, Exists her hatred?â FABIO. On my life she loves you; but in childhood, Her most sincere desirings were disguis'd By wayward contradiction, and her face, Shew'd like a mask upon the true intent That struggled in her bosom.â GUZMAN. On Almunecar's shore I have a castle, Skirted with forests circling to the sea, Built in the Moorish wars; thither I'll send her, There may she languish in the moonlight tower, And eye the midland main, and hear the surge Roll its loud discord from the coast of Afric. There may she count the tedious hours, and load The winding echoes with the name of Guzman, Who shall be oft demanded ere he come. FABIO. The purpose I approve, nor shall her trial Of perseverance, aught discountenance My penetration; the result of which, Will surely be her speedy wavering, And unconstrain'd disclosure of affection. I'll bear your pleasure to her, which shall join A secret sorrow to assum'd content. GUZMAN. Then be it soâbut the time now should lead us To the throng'd court, with off'rings of our duty. FABIO. My lord! most willingly I follow you. GUZMAN. Where the benignant royal Ferdinand, With fair incitement of exalted kindness, Expects, and properly commands our presence. [Exit. Don Guzman. FABIO. Nay now, my spirit wretchedly sustains Its infamy's concealment, and its care. Yet what is conscience? All can scoff at it, For who that sits in judgment on himself, But gives aquittal of those very crimes, Which others deem most flagrant, for he pleads Some proper motive, some necessity Invincible, which none beside consider. Yet, were it known, that solemnly I promis'd The Count Lorenzo should espouse my daughter, And that she wastes her prime in hopeless sighs For his imagin'd death, while in vile chains He languishes, and toils thro' the dull day, At the stern will of unrelenting Moors. Or should it be disclos'd that I've abus'd His letter's trust, my ruin were complete! But have I not discover'd that his father Was my invet'rate foe, and secretly The cause of those indignities I suffer'd? Then let the stripling perish in his bondage, I will not combat with his destiny, Nor rescue him to damn my future fame. [Exit. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE, An Apartment in Fabio's House. SERAPHINA and FABIO. SERAPHINA. Assure him also, That this his most indulgent tenderness Has charm'd me much, and in my true regard, Gives him most potently pre-eminence. FABIO. Then for your thought use such appliances As may engender strong affection tow'rds him: What boots it that a tenant of the tomb Should occupy your heart?â SERAPHINA. Speak not, my father! with this levity, Of such as moulder in the grave! there are, Who tho' they never more can love the living, May yet adore the dead.â FABIO. The fleetest mules await to bear you hence, And lend your chariot speed to match your wishes. Soon will I visit your lone habitation, In trust to find these wrong designs subdu'd. SERAPHINA. Most willingly I leave the splendid nothings Of life's exaltment: what is busy greatness, The pageantry of pride, or wild ambition? They are the airy offspring of deceit! But 'tis the faithful interest of the bosom, The dear attachment, the transcendent fondness, Which raise us far above each selfish meaning, And make existence rapture.âOh! from me All prospect of delight is gone for everâ In the abode I seek, my mind shall settle To the composure of consistent grief; And when, each day, with duteous reverence, I shall have paid my vows to heav'n for Alba, I'll steal one secret moment, to deplore The youth I've lost, and weep for my Lorenzo. Farewel, commend me to the Duke, Farewel. FABIO. My proper wishes bless you!â [Exit Seraphina. Her presence only tends to irritate The haughty Guzman, and induce his hate Of me, and of herself, but this division Will, by an efficacious prudence, lead To more content hereafter.â Enter Servant. SERVANT. My lord! there is a stranger asks admission. FABIO. Bid him enterâ [Exit Servant. Enter Garcias. GARCIAS. The nobleman I seek is called Don Fabio. FABIO. You see him here, Sir!â GARCIAS. My lord! I proffer tidings, which shall yield you A lasting joy (or much my mind deludes me); And which, perhaps, will render him who speaks them Welcome, however otherwise unworthy. FABIO. This introduction truly seems to flatter My list'ning sense, I pray you then proceed. GARCIAS. From fierce assailments in the proof of honor, And num'rous perils of the grappling galley, From sea disasters, the imperious taunts Of petty despots, and abhorred chanis, Return'd in safety, Count Lorenzo greets you, By me his messenger.â FABIO. Ha! The Count Lorenzo! said you, return'd? Here to Madrid? it cannot be, how has he Escap'd from slavery?â GARCIAS. Were you inform'd then of his wretched fate? FABIO. O no! I varied many pow'rful means To gain intelligence, convers'd with travellers, Promoted wide enquiry, saw such merchants As had an intercourse with distant states, But all in vain.âYet once I heard it mention'd That he was dead, which sunk me deep in sorrow. And now with unfeign'd grief I execrate (Aside. His too assur'd existence.â GARCIAS. Methinks you seem to be much agitated By my disclosure, as tho' th' event had brought No exquisite delight.â FABIO. You do my nature wrong; but the first news With so precipitate a pleasure met me, That it overcame my reason, and my tongue Wander'd without its guide. O blissful hearing! O joy unparallel'd! I shall behold Again the valued youth, the Lord Lorenzo! GARCIAS. If I possess discernment, this Don Fabio Is but a hollow, and a base dissembler. (Aside. FABIO. Where may I find him soonest, for my soul With true affection longs to welcome him? And I have many stories of import To vent upon his ear. O wond'rous rapture! That he should still be living!â GARCIAS. To the much honour'd lady, Zoriana, He now pours forth his thanks, for she it was Who trac'd his destiny, and then releas'd him By quick-remitted ransom; hence, 'tis plain In all Madrid she was his truest friend. If you shou'd wish to hold discourse with him, Present occasion offers at her palace; But having claimed too much of your attention, I take my leave:âDetested hypocrite! (Aside.) Exit Garcias. FABIO. May pestilence assail him, and despair For ever be his miserable portion!â Yet words are the fit solace of an ideot; Wise men should plan and execute.âI'll seek him, And by impressions apposite, controul His mind's misgivings should they work against me Yes, I'll exhibit some well colour'd tale That shall deceive his vision, for too far Am I advanc'd in action to retreat; Then shall assiduous cunning and exploit, Allure him to my toils, and there confound. Exit Fabio. SCENE, In Zoriana's Palace. Enter Zoriana and Lorenzo. ZORIANA. Dwell then on ev'ry circumstance of sorrow, Be eloquent in description of your suff'rings; Till from the sad extent of sympathy, Resulting from the past, my eager thought Turn to the present with unbounded joy. Lorenzo! to behold you here, restor'd From horrible captivity, and from The doubtful consequence of daily war, Sheds such dear consolation o'er my bosom, That all its wounds are heal'd.â LORENZO. You may remember, 'twas the king's good pleasure, I should approve myself an active warrior, Worthy of this distinguish'd badge he gave me, And which before had grac'd my father's breast. For this I join'd me to the royal gallies, Sent forth to clear the neighb'ring Spanish seas Of lawless pirates and insulting Turks. But 'twere a tedious hist'ry to recountâ Suffice it, that our purpose was obtain'd.â It chanc'd, however, as homeward we return'd, One summer's eve, our careless vessel slept On the blue surface of a tranquil main, While mariners and slaves, alike repos'd In the mild radiance of the setting sun. As thus in false security we lay, Three Moorish boats stole from a treach'rous creek, And wrap'd our bark in flames. ZORIANA. O wretched moment! How my heart labours at the dread recital! LORENZO. In vain we strove, the furious blazings reach'd Our mast's high head, and all was sure destruction. When Garcias, a brave Spaniard, for whose friendship I long had born esteem, plung'd in the deep, And cry'd, âLorenzo, followââI obey'd; But we were seiz'd while struggling with the waves, And carried off to slavery.â ZORIANA. My fancy ever would conceive your station, And add to distance cruellest dismay; But if reluctant slumber seal'd my lids, Then absence was no more, my soul embrac'd you. How have I thought to fold you in my arms, And shelter you from death, how have subdu'd Th' imagin'd tempest that portended ruin! Throughout the night I was your guardian spirit, And all the day implor'd protection for you. LORENZO. Kind, generous Zoriana! let me thus Upon my knees offer acknowledgment; Since but for thee my future life had pass'd In hopeless chains;âmay every bliss be thine! ZORIANA. Too long I vainly search'd for the report Of thy endurings, till, by chance a youth Who came from Tunis, being question'd by me, Spoke of thy injuries which he oft had witness'd; And shew'd my mind the picture of thy state. But if my wafted aid obtain'd thy freedom, O do not deem it was to thee a kindness, 'Twas to procure my own felicity. LORENZO. Ages of gratitude could not requite Such true beneficence;âyet let me prove This heart's devotion by some loyal service. ZORIANA. The fost'ring breeze that on its pinion bears Salubrious dew to cheer the fainting rose, Has, for its recompence, the flow'r's revival: So I receive from thy content, Lorenzo! A most divine reward.âBut dost thou know, That, on the supposition of thy death, Thy chief inheritance has been dispers'd 'Mongst various claimants? LORENZO. Why, then, be it so; Tho' I were left in penury, and consign'd To struggle with the world's worst contumely; Yet could I ne'er account myself as poor While I had love, and honour, and my sword. ZORIANA. Exalted youth! LORENZO. How shall I now restore thee My ransom's price? ZORIANA. Have I not wealth sufficient? And speak'st thou thus to me? yet if thou feel'st Proud irritation to discharge the debt,â Are there not means more delicate and dear, More flatt'ring to repay a female fondness, Than retribution of vile ore? LORENZO. There are! ZORIANA. Thy look of fond complacency, thy smile Of tender greeting, would by me be valued Beyond the richest treasures of the world. LORENZO. Nay speak not of it, gentle Zoriana! For ere these eyes first view'd thy radiant charms, Or my mind mus'd on thy extensive virtues, I was a zealous and true worshipper Of Seraphina's bright divinity. ZORIANA. And art thou still so faithful, can'st thou triumph, With persevering love, over neglect And frail forgetfulness: say can'st thou still Adore inconstancy, and heave deep sighs To gratify a rival? LORENZO. Pitying lady! Wound me not thus with dark insinuation, Nor wrong my Seraphina;âworlds may vanish, And planets quit their courses, but her faith, Shall, like the sun with pure unwearied lustre, For ever glow the same. ZORIANA. Know then, she's false! And that, seduc'd by amorous ambition, She has espous'd another. LORENZO. May this be? O wherefore did I quit my galling chains? More blest were it to bear opprobrious stripes, And linger out my years in loathsome dungeons, With the dear solace to suppose her true, Than loaded with this earth's prosperity, To meet the demonstration of her guilt. ZORIANA. And is it thus you can reward her baseness, With such emotions of distracted fondness, As, to excite, would yield me richer rapture Than heav'n might ever promise?â LORENZO. If in thy utterance have been deceit, Or even sportiveness, I will abhor thee. Not all thy mercies shall henceforth avail To counteract my hate, O Zoriana! Enter Fabio. FABIO. Pardon this strange intrusion, noble lady! But Count Lorenzo's presence shall excuse The negligence of forms, for my desire Is with an early and appropriate zeal, To offer him my joyful gratulation. ZORIANA. My Lord! your coming with so fair a purpose, Needs no apology. LORENZO. to Fabio. Is she then wedded? For ever lost to me, for whom I bore, With patience (which I thought she might approve) Each trying injury and fierce affliction; 'Twixt whom and me the holiest vows had pass'd; Is she perfidious? FABIO. Women oft are frail, And few may boast consistency. LORENZO. 'Tis wrong, My Lord! my Lord! she was above all failure, The countless virtues which adorn'd her mind, Added such power to perfect loveliness, That none could deem her capable of error. ZORIANA. Compose thy troubled spirit, chase away From recollection, that afflictive worth, Which, tho' so splendid, was but transitory.â And let one woman's constancy subdue The mem'ry of another's want of truth. FABIO. In vain I urg'd your suit, in vain I pleaded That you might yet return, mention'd your merits, Your noble birth, your youth's advantages, And all the promising prospects of your state; But she had torn your image from her thought, And was so vilely disinclin'd to hear me, That I at length was mute.â LORENZO. Be not so sparing of the horrid story, Speak out, for I can bear it, can enjoy it. FABIO. Her wayward heart was suddenly enslav'd By the gay glories of exalted station, And more, perhaps, from vanity than love, She gave her hand toâ LORENZO. Pray you, do not name him! To think that he exists, absorbs my reason; To know him, it were Hell. ZORIANA. Transcendent youth! Controul this bitter rage! O turn thine eyes From the wild beach, where ocean and the storm, Shake nature with contention; turn and view A tranquil season, milder scenes display: Yes, shun the dangerous tempest of thy thoughts, To cast one look on tenderest affection, On her, who will, to thy more certain joy, Supply the place of evanescent fondness, With an invincible, immortal love. FABIO. The wisdom of this council claims respect. And if thou doubt of Seraphina's falsehood, Altho' with anguish and remorse I speak it, Know, that thy letter was, by fatal hazard, Consign'd to herâthen buried in concealmentâ Till, late in hour of pleasure, she disclos'd To me its sad contentsâbut much she smil'd At thy distresses, and profess'd she ne'er Could, to her arms, have ta'en a wretched slave, By fetters wrung, and smarting with his blows. For verity of this, I've proof substantial. LORENZO to Zoriana. The conflict's o'er;âthen, if thou wilt receive My proffer'd hand, and a too shatter'd heart, Be this our hour of union. ZORIANA. O Lorenzo! I scarcely dareâbut can'st thou then erase The deep impression of a former passion, From the retentive tablet of thy mind, And grant me all thy love? LORENZO. In truth I can. When next, my Lord! you chance to see your daughter, (To Fabio. I do entreat you, tell her I am happy; That hearing of her baseness nothing mov'd me; That, when she yields her beauties to the grasp Of her damn'd husband, when her eager kisses Fire his cold blood, she may not be so blest, As to suppose the hellish certainty Of such abhorr'd embraces, gives a pang To the disdainful and compos'd Lorenzo. Tell her you saw me rapt'rously enfold (Embracing Zoriana. The matchless Zoriana;âand then say, (Speaking low to Fabio. That on the surface of this hated globe, Of all who agonize, and curse existence, I am the most complete and hopeless wretch. (Exeunt. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE, Hall in the Duke of Alba's Palace. Enter GUSMAN and GASPERO. GUZMAN. Did she not murmur, or in aught betray Reluctance at departure? GASPERO. Rather, my Lord! With eagerness she undertook the journey. GUZMAN. There is a scorn and strangeness in her 'haviour, Which tends, methinks, too deeply to debase me; I'll not endure it, for it bodes disgraceâ Some sentimental boy, some soft complainer, With sighs, expressing sensibilities, Has caught her in the trammels of romance. Come hither, Gaspero! a word with you. GASPERO. I but attend your pleasure.â GUZMAN. Let me appoint you steward of the castle Where Seraphina is dispos'd, there reap Advantage from the profitable office! But my first mandate is, that you observe Her ev'ry action closely, and inform me, If any desp'rate minion of the moon, Or whining shepherd, artfully approach Her sacred haunts of solitude and peace. GASPERO. In truth, my Lord! your slightest disposition Ensures my earnest will, and faithful service. GUZMAN. Then, be there no delay, but prove thyself A swift and excellent Commissioner. The circumstances will reward attention: So, with a piercing and considerate eye, Read all that passes. Should I have a rival! You wear a sword to vindicate my wrongs! GASPERO. Most readily your wish shall be obey'd [Exit Gaspero. GUZMAN. The Lady Zoriana's sudden marriage With this young Count, is prominent of danger, That should demand reflectionâfor her wealth, And courtly influence may generate, And probably give birth to new ambition; While I may lose that plenitude of pow'r, For which I've yet found no competitor. 'Twere well, however, to bestow on him Such salutation as th' occasion claims, Since, from the interview, I may discover His natural propensities, and learn, Or to despise, or court his future friendship. [Exit Guzman. SCENE, Zoriana's Palace. Enter Lorenzo and Garcias. LORENZO. O Garcias! Kindly grant me thy instruction, How to eradicate from memory, The worth and loveliness of Seraphina. But on my heart her semblance is engrav'd, And there she looks reproach, and with such tears As might become an angel, faintly bids me Enjoy the new felicity of marriage. Alas! I'm sunk e'en to the lowest ebb Of vile contrition, for these lips which swore Eternal fealty to the world's chief glory, Have now to Zoriana, at the altar, But a short moment since, proclaim'd a falsehood. GARCIAS. Why should you trouble your offenceless spirit, By such unprofitable meditation? The lady you've espous'd is excellent, Of rarest beauty, of benign discretion, Of a most princely line, and then she loves you With the pure worship of a tranced saint; While Seraphina! whom your soul had cherish'd, Prov'd false, and careless left you to your fate. LORENZO. Perhaps they've done her wrong, have basely sullied Her purity, by the foul breath of slander. Would the calm hour were come, when in the tomb, I might escape this intellectual conflict! At times I more than doubt Don Fabio's honour! GARCIAS. Nor do I think that then your judgment errs. LORENZO. There's nothing but disguise, severe injustice, And strange duplicity upon this earth; The Ign'rant shew solemnity of wisdom, The iron-hearted Rich pretend to charity, Cowards exult like heroes, ruthless Tyrants Boast of their mercy, while hard Plunderers, And infamous Oppressors of the Poor, Weep at a Sparrow's falling.â GARCIAS. Alas! there's verity in these conceptions, Which seem to overcome you. LORENZO. The Seducer, With mild approaches woos the artless maid, He lives but to procure her happiness, His protestations have the force of truth, And he appears what Woman should adore; But having triumph'd o'er her innocence, And robb'd her of tranquillity and fame, He then can deem humanity deceit; Can scorn to hide his baseness; can avow His worst intentions; and, without a blush, Consign her to the rendings of despair. GASPERO. Be more compos'd! LORENZO. Do not the mean too often Rise to distinctions by servility, Then lord it o'er the virtuous? We should mark How he that is exalted bears success, To judge how he deserves it. GARCIAS. Nay, no more! LORENZO. Perhaps I've been deluded! And Seraphina, in her virgin state, Still mourns for lost Lorenzo; but if so, Now that this desp'rate marriage has controul'd me, I do beseech thee Garcias! to have pity, Let thy benignant sword pierce my scorch'd bosom, And set my spirit free. GARCIAS. O cease these ravings! LORENZO. Know you his horrid name who wedded her? But hold, here's One of dignity approachesâ GARCIAS. Permit me to retire awhile! [Exit Garcias. LORENZO. Now must I, By difficult mast'ry of myself, conceal These pangs, and with the semblance of content. Enter Guzman. GUZMAN. Suffer the self-presenting Duke of Alba, To honor Zoriana's chosen Lord, As a new relativeâthe happy union, Communicates to me a proper portion Of your joint bliss. LORENZO. This condescending kindness, Makes me still more regret that hitherto I've only known your Grace's excellence From popular report, and Fame's applause. GUZMAN. If in the treasure of this transient life There may be found one jewel of true value, It is connubial joy. LORENZO. The sentiment So gladly urg'd, my Lord! denotes conviction. GUZMAN. Could the possession of such perfect beauty As never yet was equall'd, heighten'd by The most exalted sense, make marriage dear, I were a husband fortunate indeedâ LORENZO. I'd fain pay homage to your Lady's merit. GUZMAN. But she, I know not why, prefers retirement Upon the coast, where I've an ancient mansion, To the luxurious pleasures of Madrid. In that retreat she now consumes her time, And finds 'mongst meads and rivulets, more solace Than splendid Courts could e'er bestow on her; O! this her disposition troubles me! LORENZO. Yet such propensities accompany Refin'd sensation, and denote more feeling Than gayer natures proveâ GUZMAN. Ere you went hence, by martial enterprize To gain renown, perchance you may have seen Don Fabio's lovely daughter, Seraphina. LORENZO. O spare me, spare me, Heav'n!âsuppose I have, Suppose she is the idol of my soul, And that I now, and ever shall adore her, With bigotry of love, what of it, Sir? GUZMAN. Whoever says that he presumes to love The wife of Guzman, is a daring boaster, Or a degraded madmanâ LORENZO. If Seraphina be thy wife, I swear it; If she were wedded to a God, I'd swear it; If fifty thousand Guzmans were in arms, Pointing their dastard swords at my bare breast, To murder me for utt'rance, yet I'd swear it. Have you not heard, proud Duke! that I, Lorenzo, Am her own promised lord, and knew you not That it was base, and cowardly, and mean, To wring her cold assent, to be so curs'd As thou hast made her? for, inhuman spoiler! Her heart was mine alone. GUZMAN. Go to the lady Who has but just receiv'd thy nuptial vows, And boast to her, how fond, and how sincere, Thou art; she cannot fail to sympathize With the soft sorrow;â'tis enough for me To have discover'd the long-hidden cause Of Seraphina's coldness and disdain: Her vile reluctance on the day of marriage, Her sequent sighs, and mournings, all are due, Insulting Youth! to thy superior merit. 'Twas then for thee, I find, she pray'd to leave me. LORENZO. Did she then wed thee with despair, and pour Her heavenly tears for me; and does she shun The halls of pleasure, and the gorgeous throng Of the Escurial, to bewail my fate In lonely seats, and melancholy bow'rs; Blest be the Moon which hears her nightly moan! And blest the Echo that repeats her grief! Be sacred ev'ry flow'r whose fresh perfume Is wafted to her sense!âI'm satisfied! I ask no more, her soul has still been true. GUZMAN. Prepare to do me justice with thy sword! LORENZO. Away, away, thou hast already kill'd me; Like a malevolent and dark assassin, Planted, unseen, a mortal dagger here. GUZMAN. Low subterfuge of terror, poor evasion! They stain thy manhood. LORENZO. Think'st thou, threat'ning Duke! My life of honor shall at last be lost Upon thy sword? In truth I mean to die, But not to swell thy triumph. GUZMAN. Wretched man! I scorn thee. LORENZO. Thou hast robb'd me of all hope, Hast sunk me to extremest misery, Hast drawn, as 'twere, a mantle o'er the Sun, To shroud his noontide glories from my sight; Hast render'd Nature to these eyes a corse Of desolate appearance; yet thou deem'st That I should heed an insult, and be rous'd By what thou call'st thy scorn. GUZMAN. Then take my pity, Since thou can'st own th' extent of injury, Yet want the spirit to avenge thyself. LORENZO. Be this thy answer! (Draws his sword. GUZMAN. It is fairly spoken. They fight, Lorenzo disarms Guzman. LORENZO. There take thy weapon, (Returns Guzman his sword. For this roof protects thee. Yet know, I'll see the Angel, whom thou dar'st Denominate thy wife, but with such right, As the vile robber calls the gold his own, Which he has basely stolen. GUZMAN. Thou never shalt! LORENZO. Fill ev'ry avenue with armed troops, Surround her with more dangers than e'er guarded The prize of Jason, yet will I approach her; But having once more gaz'd upon her face, And once more heard her voice, once more embrac'd her With the chaste sanctity of heavenly love, Then, Guzman! I'll defy thy utmost malice. GUZMAN. There may be rashness in these gallant boastings. [Exit Guzman. LORENZO. He thought I dreaded The dissolution of this fev'rish mass! Come, grisly King, accept my fervent vows. Death! thou'rt to me no tyrant, but a friend! Enter Fabio. FABIO. 'Twere well that Zoriana be induced (Not seeing Lorenzo. To aid the purpose, and prevent disclosure, Of my preceding motives. LORENZO. Is it thou? I have a shrew'd suspicion that thy heart Is black and ranc'rous at the core. FABIO. What mean'st thou? LORENZO. I do believe thou art a perfect traitor; And now with reverence I call to mind My father's admonition, when he said, âLorenzo! thro' thy life shun cautiously All intercourse with Fabio, for I know him, Unprincipled, remorseless, and a villain.â FABIO. Thy father was an abjectâ LORENZO. Peace, traducer! Lest, losing my respect for those white hairs, And due regard for Seraphina's parent, I strike thee to the earth. FABIO. This is mere phrenzy, My Lord! my present business is to serve thee. LORENZO. But I will trace thy plottings and deceit; Will bring thy desperate intrigues to light, Make thee abhorr'd by such as value virtue, And hold thee up to scorn and public justice. FABIO. Thou art indeed disturb'dâso fare thee well, Yet thy repentant thanks shall greet me soon. His indignation is awakeâno time (Aside. Is to be lost, such insults too, demand A dire return, and ratify my hatredâ Then what was policy, shall now be vengeance. Exit Fabio. LORENZO. The look was big with menace, and the tongue Mutter'd internal imprecationsâHa! What hideous phantom hither comes to shrink me? 'Tis the fell fiend of darkness and dismay. Enter Zoriana. Avaunt! nor shake thy scorpion tresses here, Back to thy dread abode!âthou'st done thy duty, And I am curs'd enough. ZORIANA. My Lord! what bodes This terrible discourse, this bursting horror? O tell me of thine anguish, and the cause, Which fills those eyes with such mysterious meaning; Changes the crimson lustre of thy cheek, To livid paleness, and which shakes thy frame Thus potently, for I have spells of love, So sweetly salutary, they shall cure Thy mental malady. LORENZO. Seek the dark heath, Where never herbage sprang, or leaf unfolded; But baleful meteors glide, and spectres glare: There conjure up thy magical associates To weave the web of dissolute controul; There let the necromantic cauldron boil; Sorc'ress! I now am far beyond thy pow'r. ZORIANA. O exquisite affliction! O Lorenzo! Have I deserv'd this of you; I, who wept To think it possible thou might'st be wretched; Who sought thee in thy trouble?âchange thine aspect, Thy frownings petrify my very soul. LORENZO. Attempt to stop the eagle in its course By words, or bid the wintry tempest sleep; But never hope to check th' impetuous tide Of overflowing grief that drowns my bosom. Thou'st cruelly deceiv'd me, by vile hints Sullied an angel's whiteness, hast seduc'd me To thy detested arms by shameless wiles; Duped me, alas! to be thy husbandâwhereforeâ I claim my just prerogative to curse thee. For ever now I quit thy hated presence, To find my Seraphina, to pour forth One faithful tear, and perish at her feet. [Exit Lorenzo. ZORIANA. Where am I, whither shall I fly for hope, Who now shall aid me, when my bosom's Lord Thus casts me from him? But I will not weep, Nor rend my hair, nor utter fruitless groans To the dispersing winds; nor invocate The hov'ring demons of the night to strike me With prodigal revenge: I'll make it transport To suffer nobly, will encounter fate With a proud eagerness, and lure my solace From the sublime perfection of despair.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE, A GroveâThe Castle belonging to the Duke of Alba in the back Ground, and the Sea at a distanceâMoonlightâa Sepulchral Urn on one Side, upon which Seraphina is discovered leaning. SERAPHINA. Whither is flown thy spirit, lov'd Lorenzo! What are its dear delights; thinks it of me, As thus I mourn in the sequester'd grove? Perchance 'tis wafted by the zephyr's wing, That fans my burning bosom; or it floats Amid these chrystal beamings of the moon, To decorate the scene with silver glory. Ah! 'twas thy soothing voice, which stole but now From yon lone cypress in the plaintive song Of Sorrow's fav'rite bird; for each sad swell Had such a heav'nly and prevailing sweetness, It charm'd my heart. Methinks, at times, I've seen thee Melt into tears upon the flow'rs of morn, And I have trac'd thy visionary step O'er the grey lake at eve's unruffled hour. Where'er thou art, cast one approving glance On this cold Urn, which an unwearied love Devotes to thy remembranceâIf thou canst, Assume thy human semblance, that I may Die at the sight in ecstacy supreme. (Lorenzo enters, and, seeing Seraphina, stands fix'd in admiration. 'Tis he! 'tis he! such was his manly mein, Such was his radiant eye;âalas! I know Thou'rt but the offspring of compulsive fancy, The harbinger of madness, yet I'll bless thee, As tho' a real existence! it is true, I'm wedded to anotherâyet, forgive me! For they compell'd me to his rude embrace; My will gave no concurrence to the treason. O! do not gaze thus tenderly upon me! I may not look for comfort, haughty Guzman Will deem it infamy that I adore thee, And say that I am base, because I'm faithful. (Seraphina faints, and falls with her arms clasped round the Urn, which supports her. LORENZO. (Springing towards her. Stay but a moment, and we'll die together, For by the holy horrors of the grave! By meek religion's mandates, and the promise Of undisturb'd felicity hereafter, I love, I pity thee! SERAPHINA. (Recovering. Can it be true? LORENZO. Tho' thou art torn from me, and doom'd to bear My rival's presence with submissive duty; Tho' all th' illusions of my youth are past, Still to behold thee, still to hear thy voice, Confers such potent pleasure, that awhile, The dire assemblage of afflictive thoughts Yields to the mightier prevalence of joy. SERAPHINA. This is no frail conceit of sad derangement, For, as I live, thou art indeed Lorenzo, The only rightful monarch of my heart. (They embrace. LORENZO. Thou'st root within my soul, there grow for ever! O! 'tis a rapt'rous and celestial moment! Ha! let me rather fly thee with alarm, (Starting from her. As birds of sorrow shun the living light: Let me renounce this Paradise, to dwell 'Mongst barren rocks of comfortless dismay, Where Mis'ry keeps her court; where I may hold Distracted converse with the hurricane, And revel midst the tempest's forked flames. SERAPHINA. Give thy keen anguish scope, for, O! it shews Such bold, gigantic dignity and honor, That happiness, from the comparison, Would meanly stigmatize its vain possessors. Enter Fabio. FABIO. This is the spot that Gaspero describ'd! He is already here. The lover's speed (Seeing LorenzoâAside. Has outstripp'd my endeavours,âand their sighs Have had one mingling moreâbut to my purpose. Lorenzo! Seraphina! joy attend you! The rude and wint'ry season of affliction Shall change to summer's mild serenity, And brightest prospects now allure your sight. I am the willing bearer of such tidings, As from the anxious brow of discontent, Shall chase away the low'ring clouds. SERAPHINA. My father! What mean these words of desperate deception! LORENZO. What new invented cruelty has brought Thee to this melancholy Grove, where I Was off'ring to an angel, the full tribute Of wretchedness, and with convulsive throbs, Breathing a last farewel! FABIO. But hear me, hear me! LORENZO. Have I not heard thee utter fearful tales Of dire, disast'rous import, tales untrue, Which curdled my hot blood, and on my heart Hung palpitating horror.âDid'st thou not Lead me to think thy daughter was unworthy, Light as the winds, and faithless as thyself! That she, with wanton willingness, bestow'd Her hand on Guzman, and without one sigh Of pity, had renounc'd the scorn'd Lorenzo? FABIO. It was humanity which told thee so; That thou might'st better combat with thy fate. But 'twas my purpose then, and has been since, To labour for thy 'vantage, and procure thee, If possible, some means of extrication. Yet then I little thought, to speak thee plainly, Thou would'st so soon have married Zoriana. SERAPHINA. Have I been deceiv'd By Zoriana; is she then thy wife? She, who had all my confidence, who knew My truth, my love, my hatred, and my woe. This, this is perfidy, it rends my soul; My fate is now complete; farewel, Lorenzo! [Exit Seraphina. LORENZO. Stay, listen to me, and my vindication Shall overcome thy rageâBase Zoriana! I give thee now an unrestrain'd abhorrence. Ye torturing fiends, whose occupation is To enjoy the wretch's suff'rance, hither come; Banquet upon my pangs, and glut your famine! Yet, Seraphina, I will follow thee. (Lorenzo going. FABIO. Govern this fierce commotion, and attend (Restraining him. To the calm dictates of consoling peace! 'Tis useless to have reason, if we throw, With ev'ry sudden gust, our mind away, And dissipate its force in wild complaint. LORENZO. Hast thou some new contrivance to destroy me? FABIO. My Lord! since last we parted, I have toil'd Much for your service, and in truth, success Seems not to frown upon the undertaking. Our gracious King permitted me to speak In your behalf, when zealously I urg'd Your various sufferings, your reported death, Ill-fated cause of the disastrous marriage, 'Twixt Guzman and my daughter; then I pleaded Your earlier right, and my most sacred promise: And next I dwelt on Zoriana's wiles, To draw you to th' unwelcome snare of wedlock. LORENZO. Shall I give confidence to these assertions? FABIO. On all of which discussion, the good monarch Bestow'd a kind approval, and declar'd, His royal meaning was to make appeal To the Holy See of Rome, for your disunion From such reluctant nuptials, and to entreat Its pow'r infallible, to grant permission, That Zoriana's, and that Guzman's oaths, Be strait dissolv'd, and Seraphina's charms Restor'd to your priority of claim. LORENZO. Then she may yet be mine; e'en at the thought, My bosom shakes with such oppressive joy, As nature scarce can bearâWhat, tho' the treasure Of her rich beauty has been basely pillag'd By the vile rapine of a ruthless knave, Yet has the bright unequall'd gem, her mind, Escap'd the sacrilege, and I will prize it Still more for the contrasted preservation. But O! perhaps this hope is but delusion! FABIO. Doubt me not now, Lorenzo! By my soul! I've taken nothing from the truth, nor aught Exaggerated; but have alone display'd The generous intention of the King. Yet were it well, with profitable speed, You hasten to the court, and there enforce Your earnest suit by duteous loyalty. LORENZO. First let me gain my Seraphina's smile To sanction the departure, let me win Her pardon for my faults, her kind assent To stimulate endeavour, and the steeds Which bore me hither, with redoubled swiftness, Shall reassume their labour;âyes, I'll seek her, Expatiate on our hopes, and then return. [Exit Lorenzo. FABIO. How readily he catches at the bait! And yields to my arrangement; so his rage No more shall interfere to hurt my peace; What's he that now approaches? Enter Gaspero. GASPERO. 'Tis Gaspero! Who has obey'd his Lord, Don Guzman's will, As by your late instruction was made known. FABIO. The daring youth was here, in full employ Of his design'd seduction; tears and sighs, And miserable vows, and due complainings, Had been exhausted with approv'd effect. I rather seem'd to favour his deceit, And now he hies him homeward to return For the more sure completion of his purpose. But, prithee say, are the men rightly marshall'd? They are no squeamish villains, but true heroes; The very glory of black enterprize! In all Madrid I could not find their fellows. Enter Seraphina (unobserved). GASPERO. A short league hence, Where first the winding road enters the forest, They're station'd with th' implements of death. There shall the spoiler of Don Guzman's honor, Receive his just reward. FABIO. 'Tis well contriv'd.â SERAPHINA. Wilt thou protect him, Providence? (Aside. FABIO. (To Gaspero.) Retire! Exit Gaspero. Let the funereal raven croak his dirge! And the lone owl chaunt requiems to his soul! There let him welter in the wint'ry gale! I shall be free from his obtrusive presence, And Guzman ne'er be troubled by Lorenzo. SERAPHINA. (Coming forward.) And will you kill him, Traitor? O, my father! Forgive my intemp'rate speaking; but if ever These infant lips press'd closely to your cheek; If e'er my childish prattle won your favour; If ever you have prov'd a parent's feelings, Pity a daughter's pains! Load not your conscience With such a weight of infamy, that heav'n Itself must be incapable to recede From it's stern justice, or be mov'd to mercy. FABIO. Peace, vile Adultress! nor presume to plead For your devoted Paramour; but think, He gladly hastes from your polluted arms, To press his Zoriana to his bosom. Then from thy thought dispel this wretched fondness, Learn to despise him, and approve the deed Which rightly shall avenge such shameless falsehood. SERAPHINA. Tho' he were baser than th' envenom'd tongue Of sland'rous cruelty could represent him; Tho' he had wrong'd me by ten thousand means, And gloried in the misery he gave; Still would I prostrate thus implore to save him, (Kneeling. Or die with transport to ensure his welfare. FABIO. Detested viper, hence! thy pray'rs are fruitless; They add fresh vehemence to my resentment, And tend to prove thee most degenerate. See, see, Lorenzo comes, and thou shalt die, If but a syllable, a look, or gesture, Excite the least suspicion of his danger. Be prudent, or this dagger drinks thy blood. Enter Lorenzo. LORENZO. Art thou appriz'd, enchanting Seraphina! Of the approaching bliss which yet may greet us, Thro' the benign indulgence of the King! And has Don Fabio told thee all?â SERAPHINA. I am indeed appriz'd of what may happen, But o'er the prospect hangs such fearful gloom, That my soul sickens. FABIO. Traitress! be circumspect! (Aside, grasping his dagger. LORENZO. Forget my frantic perfidy, which arose From misconception, momentary rage, And the severe debasement of despair. Transcendent Excellence! no longer contemplate The thick surrounding darkness, but behold Hope's rising rays flecker the wak'ning dawn With fairest lustreâYes, my Seraphina! I've stood like some poor sailor on the beach, Who watches 'midst the perils of the storm, The struggling bark that carries all his store; And now I welcome home, with double joy, The vessel which contains my heart's best treasure, More valued for the dangers it has pass'd. SERAPHINA. Alas! the pinnace at the very port May yet be stranded; O, beware, Lorenzo! FABIO. Another such remark shall be thy last. (Aside. Haste to Madrid, my Lord! and I'll engage Ere thou attain the object of thy journey, She will be well inclin'd to lay aside Her present seeming coldness, and repay Thy warmest wishes with unfeign'd regard. LORENZO. I goâBut hast thou not one gracious word, One cheering smile to urge me to success? (To Seraphina. SERAPHINA. O may these tears, which so abundant flow, Be eloquent to warn you! FABIO. Speak no more! (Aside. Confide in me, and quick return to peace. (To Lorenzo. LORENZO. My only comfort rests upon thy care: And since thou hast so solemnly averr'd Thy good intentions, I will not distrust thee. Yet, Seraphina, look with tenderness At least upon me, as I say farewel. (Going. SERAPHINA. It is too much! Lorenzo, thou'rt deceiv'd, Assassins wait in ambush to destroy thee. FABIO. Then take my promis'd vengeance! (Fabio draws his dagger, and is going to kill Seraphina, Lorenzo rushes upon him and wrenches it awayâLorenzo then prepares to plunge it into Fabio's heart.) LORENZO. Inhuman monster! Be it thine to perish! (Seraphina now runs between Fabio and Lorenzo, and prevents th' impending blow.) SERAPHINA. O, do not murder him! he is my father! And if thou injure but a single hair Of his most reverenc'd head, I will abjure thee! LORENZO. I will not kill thee, execrable villain! This, thy protectress, subjugates my fury. Live, and repent! (Throws the dagger away. SERAPHINA (Falling on Lorenzo's neck). Eternal blessings on thee! (To Fabio. Look on the noble youth thou would'st have slain! LORENZO. (To Fabio) Gaze on this purpos'd victim of thy rage! And if thou prove no keen compunction, fly To deserts, where ferocious beasts reside, And learn from them to humanize thy heart. [Exeunt Lorenzo and Seraphina. Fabio. What! Gaspero! Attendants! Ho! there's treason Against my Lord, the Duke; secure the traitor! Let no one pass; be vigilant, be bold. This failure in the mode of his destruction, Shall yield him but a transitory respite. [Exit. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE, A Hall in the Castle. Enter Gaspero with a Key. GASPERO. He's well secur'd, nor shall his vehemence Again demand such numbers to controul it. Hunger will soon subdue him, and his rage Subside, when left without antagonist; While Seraphina, prison'd in her chamber, May pray in vain to save himâmy reward Will be substantial for this service render'd To Fabio, and the Duke.âWho's here? A Lady! Enter Zoriana (in disorder). ZORIANA. O, Sir! if ever pity touch'd your heart, I do beseech you, tell me where my lord, My husband, my Lorenzo may be found. Alone I have pursu'd a frantic journey, Nor ever rested since I left Madrid. 'T was expectation buoy'd me up to bear The pressure of fatigue; but shou'd my search Be fruitless, the untoward disappointment Would surely kill me. GASPERO. There has been here a youth Of fierce pretension, and repulsive valour, Who came, it seems, a suitor to the Duchess. ZORIANA. 'T was heâyet, yet, assure me of his safety, For danger, and distrust, and horrid murder Are all abroad, and each ill-omen'd breeze Whispers prophetic woe, and swift destruction. GASPERO. He has obtain'd the meed of his designs. ZORIANA. The meed! O speak! has he then suffer'd injury? No one, I trust, has done him violence; He is a nobleman of high renown, And excellent desert. Support me, heaven! (Giving a Purse Accept this trivial pledge of future giving; You shall indeed be more than rich hereafter, If you'll explain his fate, or lead me to him. GASPERO. Lady! I dare not. ZORIANA. Tell me, does he live? GASPERO. As yet, 'tis probable he may! ZORIANA. As Yet! GASPERO. If you will not betray me; but I fear. ZORIANA. Nay, do not doubt. GASPERO. I'll shew you to his dungeon. ZORIANA. His dungeon! GASPERO. Yesâthen followâbut be sure That you return e'er a short hour elapse, Or you must share his fate! ZORIANA. I am content; It shall be soâI ask no further kindnessâ That I should meet thee thus, ador'd Lorenzo! [Exeunt. SCENE, A Dungeonâa lamp faintly burningâLorenzo in chains, reclining on a block of stone. LORENZO. (Raising himself) Within these walls, thus ends my sad career! O, hapless Zoriana! could'st thou see How horribly I expiate ingratitude, Thy pitying lids would surely weep forgiveness. Creator infinite! if on thy thought (Kneeling. An atom's supplication may intrude, Grant consolation to her wounded spirit; And on my Seraphina, in thy mercy, Bestow a blest futurity of joy. (Rising. Ah! what is this existence? 'Tis a storm Of varying passions, and successive troubles. First Fear assails the child, and then he trembles, And screams but at a frown; with youth comes Love Torturing the helpless bosom, where fierce flames Of rage, resentment, jealousy contend. Disturb'd Ambition next presents itself, To bid us grasp the moon, and waste our days In angry sighs, and rivalry for shadows. Till, to conclude the wretched catalogue, Appears pale Avarice, with heart of stone, Straining delusive counters to his breast, E'en in the hour of death. Surely to escape From this oppressive being, must be peace! Begone, then, fancy, reason, memory, Since ye are but the ministers of evil, Melt into air, I'll be your slave no longer! My brain begins to burnâmy heart is bursting; They've torn away my soul, my Seraphina, And now distorted phantoms of despair, Array'd in darkness, and convuls'd with fury, Deride my pangs, and drag me to the earth. (Falls. Enter Zoriana. ZORIANA. Wherefore this dread obscurity, this cavern Fit for a felon's punishment? They dare not Degrade him to this worst indignity, 'T would be an insult to the name of Spaniard That must excite commotion were it known! (Sees Lorenzo on the ground. O! is my sight diseas'd; cling not so closely To my conviction, unrelenting furies! Drain not my heart of its last drop of hope, Nor blast me with this spectacle of horror. He's dead, he's dead, yet hear me, my Lorenzo! Leave not the hallow'd confines of the skies, Where yet thy spirit lingers, till I join thee. This cordial draught, meant for my latest refuge, Shall be the immediate med'cine of my woe. (Zoriana takes a Phial of Poison and drinks it. Nor will commiserating heaven refuse It's pardon to the victim of despair. LORENZO. (Rising) What soothing notes of melting sympathy Reclaim me from the shades? O welcome, welcome, Lovliest of women, noblest of thy sex! ZORIANA. Unutterable rapture! LORENZO. Fair perfection! Methought they forc'd thee from me, and decreed That we should meet no more. ZORIANA. Ah when? LORENZO. How hast thou Eluded all their vigilance? ZORIANA. He raves! LORENZO. Thy ev'ry gesture shews divinity; Amidst thy tresses countless cupids play; Thy look is transport, and thy voice is heav'n! Let these fond arms encircle thee! ZORIANA. I come! LORENZO. My life! my Seraphina! (Zoriana running towards Lorenzo, stops on hearing the name of Seraphina.) Why shrinks my fair, why turns from my embrace? ZORIANA. 'Tis not for me to press thee to my breast, To weep upon thy neck, and charm thy grief; There is no pow'rful magic in my eye, To fascinate thy soulâmy fatal touch Would chill thy natureâI'll no more approach thee. LORENZO. O, why this mystery of cold reproof? My reason is disturb'd, 'tis all illusion! Enter Fabio. FABIO. The wretch who may be lured by hopes of gain To execute the intentions of another, May, for a weighter profit, turn deceiver! I will not trust this Gaspero, and methinks The entrance was not guarded, or secured, Nor is there time to pause, or hesitate; Yonder he stands in meditation fix'd, His hour is come, my rage shall make him sure. (Fabio slowly advances to stab LorenzoâZoriana perceives his approach. ZORIANA. 'Tis some assassin! who would operate Against Lorenzo's lifeâstrengthen my arm, Almighty justice! Aid me to protect him. Fabio (in the act to kill Lorenzo.) Die! (Before Fabio can strike Lorenzo, Zoriana stabs Fabioâhe falls. Thou art doom'd to fallâ'tis doneâ'tis done, And I have sav'd his valued life; to you! Applauding saints! I dedicate the blow, Which kill'd a murd'rer, and preserv'd my husband. LORENZO. O Zoriana! FABIO (to Zoriana.) Thou hast triumph'd! yet in death I am consol'd to think thou must be wretched; No fond return of passion e'er shall bless thee; Lorenzo scorns thee! Curses on you both; Disasters wither you! Ah Seraphina! Yet will I not repentâfiends ne'er shall mock me For trembling pray'rs preferr'd, or abject wav'ringsâ O torture! O remorse! Yet, yet, have mercy! (Dies. ZORIANA. Such, Fabio, is the meed of impious daring! May there be pity for thy soul and mine! Alas, my nerves relax, my spirit tremblesâ (Leans against the side Scene. Enter Guzman, wounded, supported by Garcias and GasperoâLights, &amp;c. GUZMAN. My Lord Lorenzo! pray ye, loose his chains. (Lorenzo is unbound. LORENZO. Guzman, thou bleed'st apace, what treach'rous handâ? GUZMAN. Scarce had I pass'd the covert in the vale, But deeming my attendants were too slow, I turn'd to hail them; when, upon the instant, Some fell assassins, hired to murder thee, Rush'd forth, and fix'd their poignards in my heart. This gallant youth, whom chance had brought to the spot, (Shewing Garcias.) Gave brave assistanceâAh! I faint! GARCIAS. The villain that I slew, proclaim'd in dying Don Fabio his employerâand his purpose To assassinate Lorenzo. GASPERO. 'Twas, indeed! GUZMAN. O thy decrees are just, Omniscient Heav'n! LORENZO. Would I had met the meditated blow Ere suffer'd this redundant agony! GUZMAN. I trust compassion will subdue thy anger! Deceiv'd by Fabio, I espous'd his daughter, Not knowing thy pretensions! Lead me to her; For I would bless her with my parting breath! (Garcias and Gaspero lead out Guzman. LORENZO. Peace! holy peace be thine, expiring Alba! (Zoriana, weakened by the efforts of the poison, advances to Lorenzo.) ZORIANA. It only now remains, my Lord, that I Should supplicate forgiveness. LORENZO. Do not wound me By such reproachful sorrow. ZORIANA. I misled thee, Call'd Seraphina false, altho' I knew Her mind unsullied as descending snow, Her truth more steady than the mountain's base. From her, too, I conceal'd thy slav'ry. Yes, I have caus'd thee ev'ry bitter woe! Have sunk thee to despair, and lost myself. LORENZO. O fatal hearing! ZORIANA. Yet love was all my crime! LORENZO. Alas! its mandates may not be resisted! ZORIANA. Since thou can feel its force, pity its weakness! And think not half so dear was Seraphina To thy regard, as thou hast been to me. She well deserves that heart I now resign her! May happier days attend thee! and my fate Scatter no ling'ring anguish o'er thy thought, For O! I pay the price of such deceit. A subtle poison working in my bosom, Brings swift oblivion. (Zoriana sinks to the ground. LORENZO. Horror! Zoriana! My cruelty has kill'd her! hither haste, Ye vengeful ministers of eternal pain! And seize your rightful, miserable victim; Ingratitude, cold perjury, and murder, These are my light offences, and I claim The homage of the damn'd, and proud perdition. Tho' I have wrong'd thee thus, yet do not leave me, (Tenderly to Zoriana. My wife, my benefactress. (Leans over her. Enter Seraphina. SERAPHINA. Guzman is dead! I saw his life-blood issuing from the wound, As his dim eyes were fix'd in sadness on me. I will embalm him with the tears of pity! What's here? My father slain! Distraction! Murder! 'Tis desolation all, and mingled carnage. Dear author of my beingâlaid so lowâ Thy former harshness now seems due controul, While filial sorrow sanctifies thy corse. ZORIANA. O Seraphina! I beseech thee, hear me! Let not resentment for thy parent's death Deny a consolation to my shade. I leave thee now to him I truly lov'd. Unite your fervent, holiest supplications To the Supreme Disposer of Events; And, banishing my crimes from your remembrance. Plead for a wretched suicide. SERAPHINA. Tho' by that hand my hapless father fell, Yet my reluctant reason certifies That there was justice in the deed; then live, And not one sigh of mine shall e'er disturb thee. Far from the world retir'd, my penitence Shall be devoted to his soul's repose. ZORIANA. Let me breathe forth my spirit in thy arms, My own Lorenzo! LORENZO. Save her, Powers of Mercy! ZORIANA. Let thy lips bestow A sacred earnest of approaching heaven: In life, my heart was thine, 'tis thine in death. (Dies. SERAPHINA. (To Zoriana.) Alas, thy love deserv'd a different fate! How vain are the presumptuous schemes of man! How fleetingly delusive ev'ry prospect Of life's uncertain journey! There alone In yonder sapphire region, may be found Content, and pure prosperity of virtue! LORENZO. Sad sympathy shall be our only refuge, For, from her memories, must time, in vain Endeavour to obliterate the scene Of such unparallel'd calamity. To chase this darkness no fair morn shall rise, No fond endearment dissipate our sighs, Left, in affliction's bitt'rest pangs, to prove The mutual agonies of fruitless love. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, WRITTEN BY MILES PETER ANDREWS, ESQ. AND SPOKEN BY MRS. MATTOCKS. When tragic pomp, and solemn sounds are o'er, When storms, and starts, and groans are heard no more; Hard is her task, the Heroine of the past, Who on this welcome floor has breath'd her last; Snatch'd from the peaceful grave, again to rise, And titter at her own short obsequies; If her you pity, what do you think of me? Torn from my comfortable dish of tea; No warm impassion'd scenes to rant and reel in, Nor love, nor murder to assist my feeling; Sent like some Merry Andrew at a Fair, To mimic follies, and to make folks stare. (Imitates a Trumpet) âWalk inâLadies and Gentlemenâwalk inâ âThe notifiedâjust going to beginââ What shall I say? Our ever grateful Bard, Who, in your tears, hath found his best reward; Still humbly hopes, to crown his anxious toil, Th' enlivening ray of one approving smile; Unite with generous warmth to aid his cause, No fear to bring the house down with applause. Our walls are strong, they baffle Time's attacksâ Crowd hither as you willâwe dread no cracks.â Much could I offer in our Bard's defence, But fashion is too much at war with sense; The higher ranks have long let reason 'scape 'em; John Bull at length strives, awkwardly, to ape 'em.â âFegs,â cries fat Madam Dump, from Wapping Wall, âI don't love plays no longer, not at all; âThey're now so vulgar, and begin so soon, âNone but low people dines till afternoon; âThen they mean summot, and the like o' that, âAnd it's impossible to sit and chat.â âGive me the Uppero, where folks come so grand in, âAnd nobody need have no understanding.ââ That's right, Mamma, rejoins the darling plump, Miss Carolina Wilhelmina Dump; âPuppa's a foolâwith his old fashion'd jokes âAbout your Shakspears, and such surly folks: âHe hates a Consort, Ma', and that you knowâ âO yes, my Chuck, I found that long ago.â âWell, I should like a consort every night, âSweet Signor Thingomee is my delight. âThen it's so tasty, that all must agree on, âTo talk about one's box at the Pantheon; âTo scrouge the Coffee Room, to see the Ballet, âOr squint at the smart Jemmies in Fop's Alley.â Fop's Alley! Scene of wonder and surprize, Where all that's graceful, blends with all that's wise; Where Britain's youth, like horses to be sold, Sport their strip'd flannel cloathing seven fold. And thou dear region of enchanting sounds, Whose magic every meaner sense confounds, Forgive me, if awhile, in mirthful glee, I dare to trifle with thy dignity! Suppose, as foremost of the splendid groupe, Enter great Julius CÃ¦sar in a hoop. (Sings.) Ambizione! del Tiranno! Piu forte, piu pianno, ache finâ âZounds! here's my warrant, and I will come in. âDiavolo! who come here to so confound us? âThe constables to take you to the Round-house; âDe Round-houseâMi!âYou know, Sir, what I am, âCould I speak Englis, how I'd swear Got tem.ââ Now comes the dance, the demi-caractere, Chacone, the pas de deux, the here, the there; And last the Chief, high bounding on the loose toe, Or poiz'd like any Mercuryâa che gusto! (Stands on one leg. In fruitless pleasure or destructive play, The slaves of fashion fritter life away; Yet let the Bard no forc'd attractions fear, For nature's feelings still will triumph here.</field>
