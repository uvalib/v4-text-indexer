      <field name="fulltext">The Stanzas set to Music are printed in italics.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART I. ADDRESS TO SOLITUDE.âTHE PRIMEVAL WILDERNESS.âFIRST SETTLERS.âPASTORAL LIFE.âSONG TO THE GNOMES.âPLUTUS RISES; HE FORETELS THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD-FIELDS. SYMPHONY. Molto Adagio. O, Solitude! O, voiceless crowd of trees; O, hopeless wilderness without one fruit, Or herb, or graceful flower!âO, pathless maze Of maddening monotony, all glare, Or else unspeakable sadness of blank shade;â Whose intervals of grassy plain ne'er bore The pleasant sight and movement of white flocks, Or chesnut-spotted cattle; where man's form, Though savage as the scene, rarely appeared,â And when the glossy leanness darkly stalked From tangled lair, t'was but to hunt for prey In earth-holes, undergrowth, or lonely creek, But ne'er to look Above!âO, Solitude! Thou had'st an empire then without a soul Beneath the solemn and unworshipped heavens, As though nor earth, nor heaven, possessed a God. Andante Pastorale. Such was the scene, till civilized man Came with his flocks and pastoral hand To claimâredeemâand use the land,â A blessing t'were unwise to scan. He, the strong pioneer, for all In after years who crossed the sea, Did this,âwhich honest truth may call, The first seed of a Nation's Tree. Then rose the hut, the fence, the barn; Then stray'd the countless flocks and herds; The magpie in the dew-gemm'd morn Warbled his joy, almost in words. Now comes man's faithful friend, the dog; Now oxen bow their moody heads; Now the wild thorny bush-track threads Each gallant horse, or leaps the log; While the vast sweeps of grass appear Awakening to their life's first year! Allegro Molto Agitato. Behold, a change! (Beyond the range Of all the brains of simple shepherd kings;) 'Midst darkness bred Within the bed Of earth's secreting veins and wealth-clogg'd springs. White, red, and yellow rocks and clay, For ages hidden from the dayâ Or scorn'd when seenâ Shall, like a gnomic queen, Shine forth in world-bewildering array. No. 1.âChorus. Deep in the stony silence of the earth The wealth of nations lies, Waiting man's industry to give it birth, And spread its lustre 'neath the skies. Now o'er the darkness breaks a light That shows the gnomes at play, Racing about in their delight Through many a flaw and cavern bright, Lit by a golden ray! They chase each other 'midst the veins Of Earth's metallic night; With mad glee under rocks, woods, plains, They lead their elfin flight. No. 2.âRecitativeâBass. The deep hoarse voice of Plutusâfrom beneathâ The gnomes' grotesque mirth quells: Slowly he rises! and his heary breath In golden vapour works its spells. âCease these vain sports!âa different race of gnomes From distant regions comes! Gnomes of earth's surface, but whose daring spirits Urge them across the Waters of the Globe, Her rocky centuries to probeâ Ravage and rend her 'broidered robeâ With dark enchantments wrought 'neath many starry transits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. SONG FOR THE VOYAGERS ON THE ATLANTIC, INDIAN, AND OTHER GREAT OCEANS.â ARRIVAL OF MINING ADVENTURERS FROM EUROPE, AMERICA, CHINA, ETC.âSONG FOR THE LOVED ONES LEFT BEHIND.âAUSTRALIA'S WELCOME TO RELATIONS AND FRIENDS.âLOST IN THE BUSH.âCORROBOREE SONG.âVARIABLE FORTUNES.âTHE MINERS' SONG. No. 3.âChorus. The rolling ships and the rolling sea, 'Neath the rolling clouds speed gloriously; Strong hands they bear, and hearts strong as bold, Away from their kindred and country old To grapple with rocks, and demand their gold! Sing hey! over billows and flashing spray! Never were spirits more hopeful than they. No. 4.âMarch of all Nations with their National Airs. Old England's sons sail forth with three cheersâ For roast beef, jack tars, and the grenadiers; And Erin comes with her native harp; And the warlike pipe of the Scot is shrilling; And Shenkin âof noble raceâ seems willing His bard's long beard to fold up, or crop, And die with bright gold from Australia's land. Hand in handâblithe and blandâ From each foreign strandâ 'Tis a motley band! For the Yankee comes on his âlittle ponyâ To feather his tall hat in Melbourne town,â To open up lands, and teach us to driveâ To dash on, and thrive; And the German for mining brings knowledge and money,â For farmingâexploringâwill spend his last crown, Or lay his life down. The Russian deserts his paternal ice; The Parisian his civic paradise; Swiss and Spaniard make speed, Italian, Dane, Swede, Though the Dutchman strove hard to precede; And the Chinaman starts From celestial Hong Kong, With crackers and gong, And alchemical arts, Or industrious picks, His kites, And his sleights, His lanterns and fans, His strange shoes and pans, His opium-pipes and his ivory sticks, His porcelain, tea, and the Books of Cung Foo, And baskets that dance fore and aft his bamboo. No. 5.âChorus. Alas! for the loved ones we leave behind, Who sigh as they gaze on the vacant seat, And at night when they hear the threatening wind, Or hail on the windows in darkness beat! They know that we promised so soon to return, And cheer them with heaps of the prodigal gold,â Ah, little we dream love or fortune may burn False lights, when by distance made changeful or cold! Welcome, Americans!âone mother bore us; And welcome, Germans!âalso near of blood; Ye sons of valiant France! all time before us Should join our hands, E'en as our lands Will be united 'neath St. George's flood! Ship following ship o'er wharf and beach Flings scrambling crowd on crowd; Machinesâmenâluggageâall on each, As a lumber-cart shoots its load, They all heardâthey all believe The treasures of each wild ânew rush,â And headlong hopes and follies weave With child-like ignorance of the âbush.â By horse, by dray, or resolute foot, With ardent eyes they leave the town; Sleep, rich in dreams, on some hard rootâ Eat âdamperâ as t'were Eden's fruitâ And envy not a royal crown. Some on the way Through forests wander far astray, And, brooding o'er bright greedy thoughts they see, One dense dark night, By lurid light, The demon-like Corroboree; And while the great logs crack and blaze, The uncouth song, and dancing maze Astounds their earsâaffrights their gaze! No. 6.âChorus. From creek of Worooboomiâboo! And sheep-run Woolagoolaâgoo! Come Dibble-Fellow dancing in fog! All over mount Wooloolaâyah! And earth-holes of Worondiâwah! Till he vanish in the yellow Wog-wog! Old Chief of Woolonaraânah! From the Great River banks, farâfar! Hasten here with spear and boomerangâ Then to snowy Woologoomerangâ For White Fellow comes to make war! The Dibble (or Devil) Fellow, dancing in fog, represents the white or gray appearance attributed by the native blacks to an Evil Spirit. This Dibble comes from New South Wales as an omen of ill. The old Chief Woolonara crosses the Murray into this colony in warlike style; but âdiscretionâ with the blacks being by far âthe better part of valour,â he is advised to pass over to the Snowy River of Gipps Land, to wait his time for an opportunity against the White Fellows. The rhythm of the Song-dance here adopted, is that of the blacks on the Goulburn River. The extra syllables at the end of most of the lines is characteristic of the untaught singing of the lower orders of all nations; and with none is it more conspicuous than among the agricultural labourers in the rural districts of England. The only âinstrumental accompanimentâ to the Song-dance of the Australian corroboree is the measured beating upon a sort of drum made from a dried opossum skin. âR. H. H. But while some stray, and others strive in vain The treacherous riches of their hopes to seize, Many, at once, more than they hoped attain With half a prayer to Plutus on their knees. To the mad city straight they hurry down, And waste in varied vices all they found,â The scholar fares but ill beside the clown Whose soul was ever nearer to the ground. Yet, O, believe a true heart thinks of home, And those he left with stifled sobs all pale; The wealth he finds dispels their anxious gloom, While eager eyes smile o'er his wondrous tale. âReceive,â he says, âthe earliest fruits Of labour by unpractised hands; Australia's tree of golden roots Will spread with years through many lands.â The day's toil o'erâ Toil hard and longâ Aching and sore, Round the log fire The smoking quire Now sing the Miner's Song. No. 7.âChorus. Our hardships 'midst hot sand and clay, Or waist-deep in the watery claim, 'Neath winter's frost and summer's ray, Test the brave heart and sturdy frame. But huzzah! for the near, or the distant new rush, On the quartz-reef, the creek, or the close-timbered bush! And huzzah! for the steady old ground, Where sure wages are made By a new goldsmith's trade, And large fortunes are sometimes found! The deep shafts, with the trams below; The cross-drives, and our working bank; The liberty to come, or go, Proclaim our independent rank. Then huzzah! for the freedom of mining life, With the single man, or the miner-and-wife! And huzzah! for the true horny hand! By good luck, or hard work, We can always uncork A bottle to drink, âTo this Land!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. GOLDEN MILLIONS.âFORTUNATE MINER'S SONG OF COURTSHIP.âDESPONDENCY OF THE UNFORTUNATE.âTHE COLONIAL CURSE; ITS INFLUENCE ON THE BODY AND THE MIND.âTHE GENIUS OF AUSTRALIA RISES.âTHE POET'S MIRROR.âPROPHETIC VISIONS.âADDRESS TO ALL THE SISTERS OF THE SOUTHERN SEAS. No. 8.âSoprano Solo. A sultry haze broods o'er the silent bush, And horse and ox move slow through streaming dust; In each man's face is seen the feverish flush Of hope, or of success; the ceaseless thirst For gold, which pile on pile no more allays Than cravings of the gourd are quell'd by desert rays. Our shining ore To England's wondering shore Deep-laden ships in safety bore; And ships and men, and gold, each day were more and more. Ah, many a varied song had they, As Fortune bless'd, or blank'd their way. No. 9.âTrio.âSoprano, Tenor, and Bass. A heavy purse I proffer thee, And Australia's sweetest wine, If thou wilt seat thyself by me All in this bright sunshine. Be mine!âand share broad acres rare, With ores in many a seam; And hills and slopes for vineyard-hopes Beside yon River's gleam! To one I will my heart unfold, And show a secret mine More pure and lasting than thy goldâ More generous than thy wine. Come weal! come woe! What a sunny glow Men find in a soul like thine! No. 9 Â½.âTenor Solo. I stand upon the listening shore, Beside the whispering waves; I hear the slumbrous sigh of winds Within the ancient caves. But whispering wavesâand winds, and caves, Ye only bring to me The inward song, which echoes long Through the ruins of Memory. O, faded years! O, wasted toil! O, wreck-strewn rocks, where cloud-gilt surges boil Whence comes despondencyâ And then despairâ The draught that kills life's energyâ The Curse that drags him grave-ward by the hair! Oh, if one voice could stem a tide That threaten's youth's full-blossomed shootâ Body and mindâmarring the pride Of manhood by a poison'd root, It should shriek out, as from a mosque, With force to shake the midnight airâ âAlcoholâopiatesâand burlesque?â Laugh at the warningâbut beware! Laugh thy brief hour, yet O, believe Life hath fixt laws which ne'er deceive: The desecration of a fane Makes walls and altar-flame in vain. No. 10.âLast Chorus. With quadrate crown,âher chariot swiftly rising, Drawn by tall Emus; in one hand the glory Of Britain's Flag, and in the other poising A Golden Ship, while her primordial story A snowy Fleece beneath her feet displays,â The Genius of Australia now uprears Her youthful form, like Hope without Hope's fears; While o'er her head our Cross with loveliest rays Heralds the brightness of her future years. What she hath done for Britain, and the world, Let history fairly tell; what she may doâ Unless by foreign warfares backward hurledâ The Poet's mirror shall in symbols show. Reefs of quartz and beds of clay,â Hills that catch the earliest ray,â Crack, and split, and yawn asunder, To display Earth's latest wonder! Through the interval I see Enchanted vistas, endlessly; Framed each sideâabove, beneathâ With gems and aurifloral wreath, O'er which doth lovingly entwine Foliage of the clustered vine. In the foreground, down each bankâ Order graceful, rank by rankâ Fall cascades of ruby hue; Purest wine of vintage new! Now, above the sunny rocks Heaven's vast field of fleecy flocks Sleepâand floatâand creep away, Softly, as day follows day; And, beyondâhills, reefs, and ranges, Forest-fringe to Sea-foam changes; And the clear, yet far-off line Streak'd with silver-grey doth shine! See! 'tis dotted o'er with barksâ Varied venturesânew-world arksâ Destined soon yon shores to hail, New trades to feed with many a sail! Opening to life those dreaming seas, Like seeds that come with cloud and breeze! Change again, thou mirror'd Scene! Albion's cliffs 'midst breakers stand: Grandly now another land Looms above the misty screen! White cliffs also make advance Meeting their royal sisterâFrance! Tempests from the ice-crown'd North, Hurl'd on one, roll back from bothâ Or friendship breaks like ocean froth. For old traditions of Power are fed With the lasting breath of a Great Death-bed; And remember, Queen of the world of Sea Greece, once, and Rome, were proud like thee! Change again! and I behold The ponderous paws of a lion old, Folded across, all drowsily: His gorged body and brain As grey as his mane; Too rigid to act, and disdaining to see, And leaving thus his far-spread dominions For spoil or pollution of harpy pinions, Till his own forest, overgrown, May crush with falling trunks his ancient throne! What for us?âshow all that's coming! Good, or evilâneitherâboth? Ruinâpauseâor mighty progressâ Glorious age, or death in youth? Something, all unknown, yet certain, Ever do we strive to see; Would'st thou dare to raise the curtain, If't were offered now to thee? In yon clouds that move majestic, Varying faces, forms, and powers, In the Present show the Future,â But to other eyes than ours. Better so, than to fore-run Our destined race,â And standing in some lonely place, See our own setting sun! All's dark.âThe Mirror gleams once more! Oak, with moss and mildew hoar,â Monarch once of mighty span, Now seem'st thou but as mortal man. Huge arms and acornsâbeauty, birth, All return alike to earth. Yet, O, Wooden Walls, transform'd To iron shields and towers deform'd, Confront Time's doom! for your old spirit Each true descendant doth inherit: Thy youngest scion may impart Best solace to the grand old Heart,â Fresh acorns, and new navy-shoots With iron-mines beneath their roots! Nay, more;âto all grey lands that groan With press of bodies, till each stone Hath stronger tenure of the whole Than any poor-born starving soul, Vast fertile tracts, like open arms, Offer ye shelter from life's storms, Ye South Sea Sisters! circling east, west, north! Unite in Federal bonds for one fixt power, So shall ye find no sudden evil hour Darken your futureâcheck your prosperous growth. Time at your roots hath not one gnawing tooth, Then wisely cherish each first fruit and flower; And, all unlike the common slow degrees Whereby men build an empire's central tower, Ye may fresh models give for historiesâ Spreading o'er half this Globe of lands and seas, New trades, new facts, new hopesânew Nationalities.</field>
