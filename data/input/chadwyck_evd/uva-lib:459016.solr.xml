      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. A little wit, lesse learning, no Poetry This Play-maker dares boast: Tis his modesty. For though his labours have not found least grace, It puffs not him up or in minde or face, Which makes him rather in the Art disclame Bold License, then to arrogate a Name; Yet to the wit, the scholler, and the Poet, Such as the Play is, we must dare to show it Our judgements to but too: And without fear Of giving least offence to any ear. If you finde pleasure in't, we boasting none, Nor you nor we lose by'expectation. Sometimes at poor mens boards the curious finde 'Mongst homely fare, some unexpected dish, Which at great Tables they may want and wish: If in this slight Collation you will binde Us to believe you'have pleasd your pallats here, Pray bring your friends w'you next, you know your cheer.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. Scene. 1. Disanius. Justinius. Meeting. Dis. Good morrow my good Lord. How fares the King? Jus. More sick in mind then body, by th'opinion, (Not onely of the skilful Doctors, but) of all That come about him. Dis. I that have not seen him Since he was sick, can guess, then at the cause Of his distemper. He is sick o'th'subject; Th'unquiet Commons fill his head and breast With their impertinent discontents and strife. The peace that his good care has kept'hem in For many years, still feeding them with plenty, Hath, like ore pampered steeds that throw their Masters, Set them at war with him. O misery of kings! His vertue breeds their vices; and his goodness Pulls all their ills upon him. He has been Too long too lenetive: A thousand heads (Or say a hundred, or but ten) cut off Of the most gross ones, the prime, leading heads Of theirs a moneth since, had preserv'd him better Then all his doctors pills can purge him now. Jus. You are too sharp Disanius. There's a means, As milde as other of the Kings clear Acts, In agitation now, shall reconcile All to a common peace no doubt. Dis. What's that Justinius? Jus. Stay: Here comes Stratocles. Ent. Strat. Dis. I fear, in that Ambitious pate lies the combustable stuff Of all this late commotion. They confer aside Str. Why is man Prescrib'd on earth to imitate the Gods, But to come nearest them in power and action? That is to be a King! That onely thought Fills this capacious breast. A King or nothing! Jus. He's deep in meditation. Dis. On no good. It is some divellish waking dream affects him. I'le put him outâAnd as I was about To say my Lord. Str. What? when Disanius? Dis. About a moneth since, It stick still in my jaws. Be not ambitious, Affect not popularity. 'Tis the most Notable break-neck in a kingdom. Str. In whom? Dis. I know to whom I speak; would Stratocles As well knew who he is, and what he does: It would be better for him. Thank me not, I wish it for the king and kingdoms good, Not yours I do assure you, my great Lord; Yet mine own Peer, if you forget me not. Str. You take your time Sir to make me your mirth. A time may comeâ Dis. When you may be my King, And then up goes Disanius. Is't not so? Str. Yes, up to Court, to be king Stratocles fool. Dis. The Court now priviledges thee, or I would change A cuffe with your great Souldier-ship and popular greatness With clowns and Citizens, and Gentry, sprung By their late peaceful wealth, out of their dongue. But let 'em thank our pious King, not you That claim (as merit for your service done) Their loves and voices. Jus. Cease my Lords this strife. The King may hear on't, whose perplexities Already are too grievous. Pray be silent, The king approaches. Dis. Wee'll attend his entrance. Enter king &amp; Eupathus. King. Upon those terms they are come then, Eupathus? Eu. Four of the chief in the commotion, Upon the ingagement of my faith, that you Had past your kingly word for their return In safety, I have brought to Court, who wait Your present will and pleasure. King. Bring 'em in. Disanius, welcome. I thought well to send for you To take a Councellors part of my late cares Into your consideration. Dis. I attend Your Highness pleasure. King. Nearer good Disanius. They talk privately. Str. Do you deal in secret king? The Commons sent for To their examination, and this old Antagonist of mine cal'd to confront me, And I prepar'd by no intelligence To fit me for th'incounter? Let 'em come. I must not be deny'd to stand as fair In competition for the Crown as any man The King himself elects for his successor; The people are mine own thro' all his parts: He may command their knees, but I their hearts. King. Stratocles, Justinius, Disanius sit. My lords, altho' our Lawes of Thessaly To you, as well as to our self, are known, And all our customs, yet for orders sake I shall lay open one to you. That is, when A king deceaseth without issue male (As I unfortunately must) the Commons Are to elect their King, provided that He be of noble blood, a souldier, and one That has done publick service for the Crownâ Str. That makes for me. King. Or else the son of some Great General slain in battel for his countrey (As my Adrastus was.) Dis. O my brave brother! King. Twenty years sorrow for that Souldiers loss Has not worn out his memory. Str. Your grace Forgets not then Souldiers of fresher fame. King. Some other time to boast good Stratocles. Dis. Twere good youl'd hear the kingâA general, Or a Generals son may be elected. There Your Majesty left. King. Or if the sonless King Yet has a daughter, and he match her in His life time to a husband that is noble, He stands immediate heir unto the Crown Against all contradiction. Str. Now think upon my service, Royal Sir. Dis. Now think upon my Nephewes, Royal Master, The sons of brave Adrastus, who was slain Twenty years since in fighting of your battel. Str. Twere good you would hear the king. The husband of Your daughter must be elected. There you left, sir. King. It rests now that a speedy choice be made Of a fit husband, one that may acquire Eudynas love, and peoples approbation, The people, (for whose noise I must not rest Till my successor be appointed to them) Are wild till this election be made: They have, in arms, made their demand, and wait Enter Eupathus 4 Rustiks. My present answer. Dis. O here they come. These be the principals The heads, the heads, forsooth they call themselves. Head-carpenter, head-smith, head-plowman, &amp; head-shepherd. Kin. Nay, pray approach; &amp; seem no more abash'd Here then amongst your giddy-headed rowts, they all kneel. Where every man's a King, and wage your powers Gainst mine in foul defiance. Freely speak Your grievance, and your full demand. 1. Rus. Tis humbly all exprest in this petition. 2. Rus. By all means have a care that, to any question, we give the King good words to his face; He is another manner of man here then we took him for at home. 3. Rus. I sweat for't. I am sure I have scarce a dry thred in my leather lynings. 4. Rus. They made us heads i' the countrey: But if our head-ships now, with all our countrey care should be hang'd up at court for displeasing of this good King, for the next Kings good our necks will not be set right a-again in the next Kings raign I take it. 1. Rus. My head itches to be at home again. 2. Rus. My head itches to be at home again. 3. Rus. My head and heart both akes for fear. Would I were honestly hang'd out o'the way to be rid on't. King. There you may read my Lords what we before Found would be their demand. Tis for a King That must succeed me. Dis. And because you have Govern'd them long in peace, by which they thrive Their wisdom would have you intail that piece On them for after times; and so they nominate Ambitious Stratocles to be your heir. Str. Envious Disanius, my merit is Their Motive. King. Cease your strife.âYou have stood, more inclin'd To lay your choise on Philocles, or Philargus The Twin-born sons of long since slain Adrastus. 1. Rus. May't please your Majesty we are inform'd That in their travails unto Delphos, both Of them are dead. Dis. That information Was meerly by suggestion (I dare speak it) Insinuated by Stratocles. They both live And are upon return. 1. Rus. Would we knew that. Lord Stratocles then should pardon us. Hee's a man Gracious amongst us. Butâ 2. Rus. Philargus! Oâ Philargus, be he living. 3. Rus. I say Philocles. Brave Philocles is the man. Str. False, empty weathercocks. 4. Rus. I say Lord Stratocles is the man we know And ought to honour. Str. There lives yet some hope. Jus. What strange confusions this? Or whither will You run by several wayes? Philargus one, Another Philocles; a third cries Stratocles. In this you say you'l have no king at all. This must be reconcil'd, or you pull ruine Upon your selves. He, whom the king is pleas'd To give his daughter to must be your King. 1. Rus. All that we crave (and that upon our knees) Is, that the king will graciously be pleas'd To make a speedy choice, and give us leave With pardon to depart, and signifie His Royal pleasure to the doubtful countreys. King. Tell 'em they shall expect, then, but a moneth, In which short time my daughters marriage Shall be consummate. All Rus. The Gods protect your Majesty. Ex. Rust. King. And now, my Lords, the commons being at peace, Let me prevail your private jarrs to cease. Exeunt omnes. Scene 2. Eudyna. Thymele weeping. Eud. Madam, the cause is mine; tis mine to mourn In chief, if they be dead. They were your sons, Tis true, and though they were your onely comforts Upon this earth, you but resigne to heaven The blessings that it lent you. But to me They were a pair of equal lovers; and By me so equally belov'd; and by The king my father so 'bove all men respected That I by either had been made a Queen, Which title I for ever will disclaim If they be dead. Thy. O my Philargus. O my Philocles! Ye Gods I know they did not seek your Counsels Nor dare to approach your altars, but with all Due reverence and required ceremony. And could your Delphian Oracle, when they Were friendly competitioners for love, Answer them but with death? Eud. The rumor, Madam, Carries so little shew of truth, that you Do ill to take so deep a sense of it; Much worse t'expostulate, as if you had An injury done you by the Gods. Have you Been from mine infancy my governess, And careful councel-giver; and must I Find cause to chide you now? come dry these tears. Enter Garrula. Gar. Where's my sweet princess? Where's my Lady governess? Eud. O Garrula, welcome. I could never wish Thy company more usefully: For thou bring'st Some recreation on thy countenance alwayes. Gar. I am glad my countenance pleases you. It may: For I have on it now (could you discern 'em) A thousand joyes dancing within these wrincles More then my feeble failing tongue can utter. And that's a grief to me 'mong all my joyes; The failing of the tongue, the tongue, the tongue Is a great grief to any woman. But To one in years, and well in years, as I am, It is a grief indeed, more then the loss Of any other member. Eud. But I pray thee Let not that grief deprive us of the hearing Of, at least, one of thy whole thousand joyes. Gar. Tis a report of joy and wonder, princess; Enough to make not onely you, and you, But King and kingdom glad, could I but utter't. Eud. Thou dost speak well enough, and enough too, I pray thee tell it. Thy. Tis some faign'd stuffe She hopes to palliate our sorrowes with. Gar. 'Tis a report, worth more then all the stories That I my self have told in child-bed chambers, To restore spirit to the pallid flesh. And I have been a woman as good at it (Without vain boast bee't spoke) as any she In Thessaly, that ere durst undertake The office of a Midwife: And that the queen Your Mother knew, when I delivered her Of the sweet babe (your self.) She is in blisse Now in Elisium. But you, Madam Governesse, Can yet remember good old Garrula, That took into the light your twin-born sons, And thereby hangs a taleâ Thy. What means this woman? Eud. Good Garrula, thy newes? thy present story? Gar. 'Tis such a story, that could I but utter't With volubility of tongue!âBut O This tongue, that fails me now; for all the helps Of Syrups, and sweet sippings. I still go She sips oft of a bottle ather girdle. Provided, as you see, to cherish it. And yet it falters with me. Eud. We shall ha't Anon I hope. Placilla, whats your news? Ent. Placilla. Pla. 'Tis excellent Madam. And I was ambitious To bring you the first taste of it. But if Garrula has in that prevented me, I can with no lesse joy relate it yet. My brothers are return'd, and safe, from Delphos. Thy. Be thou as true as th'Oracle. Eud. Now, Madam. Pla. Mother, tis true. Gar. 'Tis that I would ha'told you Had not my tongue fail'd me i'th'utterance. Eud. Thy tongue ran fast enough, but lost its way. Pla. Three minutes, Madam, brings 'em to your presence. Eud. How is it with you, Madam? Let not joy Beget a worse effect then did your fears. Thym. swounds Help, Garrula. Gar. Ods pity, what dee mean. Madam, look up, and speak up too you were best, Do you know who talks to you? Speak; and speak well too. I shall speak that will be worse for you else. Madam, you know, that I know what I know. Thy. I am well I thank you, Garrula. Gar. O are you so? Eud. I have observ'd that often in her language, This chattring Midwife glanceth at the knowledge Of some strange hidden thing, which like as with A Charm, she keeps my Governess in aw with. I guess it but some trifle: For I know The Lady is right vertuous; yet it may Be worth my inquisition at fit time. Thy. You have felt the comforts of my friendship Garrula, And had you common charity, you'd forbear me. Gar. Iâdone Madam. Be secure. But yet, Though I forbear to speak, I not forget. Eud. You have not yet, Placilla, told the means A shout &amp; crying Philar. &amp; Philocles, &amp;c. Of your rich knowledge. Pla. Nor shall I need now Madam These shouts of joy that follow'd them to Court Attend them to your presence. Eud. O let us meet 'em. Madam, come away. Thy. O ye Gods, I thank ye. Ex. omnes pret. Gar. Gar. I have a son there too, as dear to me As any Mothers onely born can be, Whose name's not voic'd with theirs. Yet by your favour Great Madam Governess, he has discharg'd The office of a Governor ore your sons, As well as you have over the Kings daughter. And they have suck'd more of his Helycon Then she has of your doctrin: which their breeding sips he bottle. Together with their Travels through his care Will testifie (I doubt not) to my honor, That have brought forth a son of such performance. Dis. Did not I say, 'twas Stratocles that rais'd Ent. Dis. Jus. Phila. Philo. Eud. Thy. Pla. Geron. That hideous rumor of their deaths, among His wilde idolators, in hope to gain Election by their ignorance and rudeness? Jus. 'Twas well those factious heads were wrought to come Before the King to finde his clemencie, And probabilily that these were living. Dis. And how they then shrunk in their necks from Stratocles! It has so laid the flames of his ambition, That these may safely now tread out the fire. Phila. Welcom again my princely Nephews, welcom. Phil. Thanks, courteous Uncle. Thy. You interrupt me, brother. Dis. Good woman, cry thee mercy. Mothers are such things! Gar. Why, what things are we mothers? Dis. O the old night-piece with her dark lanthorne by her. Gar. You'l give us leave to take The comforts due unto us in our age, For which we suffer'd sorrow in our youth! Our children are our children young or old. Dis. So is my horse my horse. Gar. You have repli'd, As Whilome did a Councellour at Law, Who said his adverse Advocate had pleaded To as much purpose as a hen i'th'forehead. Dis. Geron, th'art welcom. Thou still keepst thy humor, Thy travels ha'not chang'd thee. Thou camest home As wise as thou wentst out. Ger. So Whilome said, A miser, having much increas'd his store, He had as much still as he had before. Dis. Enough, I'le give thee over. Thy. O my dear off-spring; every sight of you Is a new recompence, and satisfaction For all the pain and travel of your birth. In you your fathers memory shall live Beyond the malice of the grave and death: And I, when my rejoycing shall be full, And cannot take addition, freely yeelding My flesh to dust, shall yet be blest by those VVho shall give testimony to your vertue. Philar. 'Twere a sufficient spur to noble actions To be rewarded but with your content, Which to procure we make our businesse. Thy. Philocles, Your brow is clouded. Has the Oracle Adjudg'd against you. Pray let us partake The knowledge of the Delphian decree; And which of you stands highest in the favour Of wise Apollo, to be husband to Princesse Eudyna here the Kingdoms heir. What speaks the Oracle? Philoc. Such a Verdict, Madam, Requires an OEdipus to construe it. I neither know't, nor am solicitous After the meaning. Gar. Wisely spoken, Pupil. So Whilome answered an Ãgyptian Porter To one demanding what he bore conceal'd? Tis therefore cover'd that thou shouldst not know The cases are alike. Eud. Pray let us hear it. Cannot your Tutor Geron play the Hermes T'interpret it? Gar. I am not Ãnigmatical: But all for Apothegmes. Besides, I say (As Whilome Aristippus of a Riddle) It is not safe to loose what being bound Doth trouble us so much. Gar. Let me come to't. Dis. Yes by all means: For as one Whilome said The blinde are best i'th'dark. Gar. My Lord, your trumps Are ever shot at me. Blinde as I am, I perceive that. And make much of your Riddle, I know both what it can and will come to, Better without the sight of it, then all You can, with all your wise constructions. And so I leave you. Thy. Not in anger, Garrula. Gar. Madam, you know I know. I must take leave To take a Nap. Exit. Dis. And Governour Geron, wait upon your mother, Trust our cares with your charge. Ger. So Whilome said A School boy, when another rais'd his top, Let me alone, my self can keep it up. Exit. Eud. And now let me entreat that we may hear The hidden sentence. Happily so many May guesse at the intent. Dis. She longs to hear Which of the two is prickt to be her husband. Phi. Here it is. If there be any thing. Dis. Let me be Clerk. I hope at least to read it. Contend not for the Jewel, which Ere long shall both of you enrich. Pursue your Fortune: For tis she Shall make you what you seem to be. Appollo, thy great wisdom hath quite fool'd mine. Philo. Nothing but contradictions. Thy. As how, Philocles. Philo. He commands here. Contend not for the Jewelâwe agree, Eudyna is the Jewel.âwhich shall both of you enrich. How shall she enrich us both? Can she be wife to us both? Then here he bids Pursue your Fortune.âAnd we both agree Eudyna is that Fortune too: she's both The Jewel we must not contend for; and The Fortune we must both pursue. Then here He sayes tis she shall make us what we seem to be. What do we seem? we are no Hypocrites In flesh or spirit; no phantastick bodies Or shadows of humanity. Philar. No, Delphos is but a den of jugglers, which profanely Abuse divinity, and pretend a God Their Patron to authorize their delusions. Dis. Nephews, the Gods had need be cautilous For what they speak if you may be their Judges. Thy. What thinks good Justinius? Jus. My Lords, here's two commands; One, that you not contend to gain the jewel; The other, that you both pursue your fortune. Both these commands are thus to be obey'd; Contend not for her as to violate Your unexampled friendship, which you are Renown'd for ore all Greece; And both pursue Your fortune in her without eithers grudge, At tothers happiness in her choice. Philar. Noble Justinius, thanks. Philoc. This we can do. Philar. And for the happiness which we both aspire to We here confirm the friendship long since plighted, Which never shall be broken by Philargus. Eud. Noble Philargus. Philoc. So vows Philocles, 'Tis not the cloudy language of the Gods Shall make our breasts tempestuous or stormy: But with the same serenity and quiet, As heretofore our hearts shall mingle still, And fortifie their truce. Let the event Expound their Ridle. If good, it is our merit; If bad, we know our vertue can correct it. Mean time Philargus take the word of Philocles, That though there be no happiness on earth I can esteem above Philargus friendship, But fair Eudyna's love, which onely is The treasure I can covet from Philargus; And cannot look to live but to enjoy it Rather then justle with his friendship, I Will die to lose it. Eud. Noble Philocles. Philar. You have made my vow, my brother Philocles, And friend, which is above it. I will seek And rather die then fail to gain her love: But that, and the whole kingdom in addition Must divide our friendship or affection. As we are Twins in birth, we'le be in mind Unto our latest breath. Let Greece hereafter Forget to mention the Tyndarides With their alternate Deities, and tell Of two Thessalian brothers could refuse A happiness (which onely is not Heaven) In detestation of priority; Would not be happy, 'cause they might not share An individual, both Time and Thing. Eud. Love, and ambition (I have heard men say) Admit no fellowship: It holds not here. These will have neither wife nor crown alone. They each desire my love; but neither can Enjoy't unless he were the other map. My love is doubly tane, yet must gain neither, Unless I could enjoy them both together. O, ye Gods! Why made ye them two persons, and assign'd To both but one inseparable mind? Or, why was I mark'd out to be that one, That loves and must embrace, or two, or none; O my perplexity. Sinks. Dis. Look to the Princess. Philar. Madam. How fares the life of goodness. Philoc. She sinks. Dear Mother, Sister; bring your aids. Philar. To keep the world alive give your assistance. Jus. Ye Gods be now auspicious. Dis. A love-qualm. To bed with her and call for Cupids aid, He best can cure the wound that he has made. Exeunt omnes. Explicit Actus primus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Scene. 1. Doris reading a Letter. Do. My Lesbia, my Cinthia, my Licoris Or (which is best of names) my lovely Dorisâthat's I. I still am thine and cannot commutate, I am as certain to thee as thy fate. Tis not my study, or my travails can Make me to thee appear another man: Thou may'st affirm of me as Whilom did Xantippe of her husband whom she chid, Grave Socrates regardless of his worth He still return'd the same that he went forth. Before I visit thee, thus may'st thou hear on Thine in the tribulation of loveâGeron. Ha, ha, ha. Old Whilom Geron,! art thou come again? Could Delphos not detain, nor the Sea swallow thee But I must be in danger to be punish'd With the porcupine bristles? Fate deliver me. En. Placilla Pla. Doris, you must be vigilant in attendance, And see that no man pass this lobby, towards Her graces lodging. Tis your charge: look to't. Dor. Mistress you know your Mother laid that charge On me before, and I am ready here To answer every commer in his kind Had you forgot it? Pla. Pardon me, I had; But my care hurts not. One thing more good Doris. If my dear brother Philocles come to visit, Prithe call me. Speak, wilt thou. Do. âhelp your head. I must not stir from hence, yet I must come To call you forth. Away, some body comes. Pla. I trust unto thee Doris. Exit. Dor. What a sick Court is here? Shee's love-struck too. I can with half a sense find her disease; But cannot guess the object of her love. She keeps the fire so close up in her bosom, That she will sooner perish by't, then suffer A spark of it flie out to make discovery. The Princess she's love-sick for two; and her Despair of gaining either's her consumption. But what think I of their loves, when mine own Is trouble enough? Now the visitants; My great Lords Howdies are upon the entry, And the unwelcom'st first. Ent. Matho. Ma. Good morrow Lady. May I crave admittance to the Lady Governess? Dor. Yes, you may crave it Sir, But not obtain it: Her nearness to the Princess at this time Is by so strict necessity requir'd. Ma. May I prevail then, to impart the duty I have in charge, unto the Ladies daughter? Dor. That is the Mistriss whom I wait upon, Though now at remote distance: She attends Her Mother at this instant, and her Mother The Princess in much privacy. If I May be thought worthy to receive the knowledge Of what you have in trust unto the Princess, It shall be orderly convey'd unto her Grace. Ma. Lord Stratocles, solicitous for glad tydings, (Beseeching that her Grace be pleas'd to take The tender of his service; and affirming Upon his honour that no rest affects him Until he shall receive a perfect knowledge Of her recovery) prayes to be advertis'd In what condition of health she fares; Or to gain leave to visit her himself. Dor. Sir, you have lost much time: you might have said How does the Princess? And I answer thus, She is most dangerously sick; not to be seen By him or any man. Ma. Yet let her know My Lords obsequious care for her recovery. Dor. I'le tell my Mistriss, who shall certifie Unto my Lady, who shall intimate Unto the Princess what you have left in trust With me, her Graces hand-maid thrice remov'd. Ma. I will acquaint my Lord; who for your care Shall upon his advancement to the Crown Give me command, who will give present order Unto my man for your promotion. Your diligence deserves it. Exit. Dor. My great Lords especially parasite. I am beholden to you. Here comes another; an importunate, Ent. Tersulus. Though impertinent suitor of mine own. Ter. My beauteous Doris, first my love presented Unto your self, my Lord Philargus craves To know how fares the Princess. Dor. This comes nearer To my regard then tother; and deserves A comfortabler answer. She's not well Sir, But much amended in her health. 'Tis like, Your Lord (would he approach to visit her) Shall find a fair admission to her Grace. Ter. I dare not (to delay my Lord a minute Of these glad tidings.) Stay to prosecute My love-suit to your self. Dor. No, no; away. Away good Tersulus; and hazard not Your Lords, for your own fortunes. Ter. Yet my Dorisâ Dor. Yet again man. Ter. Be pleas'd to think of me. Dor. I shall, and better of you when you are gone. Ter. Wing'd with that hope, I fly. Exit. Dor. A pretty nimble fellow and a Taylor. Ent. Varill. I could almost affect him, did not this More supple handed Barber put him by. Var. Sweet Doris! thus, by me Lord Philocles Salutes the Princess. Kiss. Dor. This requires an answer Of health indeed. Var. How fares her highness? Dor. Well. Exceeding well, and longs to see your Lord. Var. I'le hast to tell him so. Dor. Nay, good Varillus, I have not gain'd a conference with you Since your return from Delphos. Var. At more leasure I'le tell thee wonders, Doris. Dor. Something now. Var. Ha'you seen your lover Geron, the old tutor, Since our arival? Dor. Here is an Epistle Came from him to my hands this morning. Hang him. Var. Well: he has been the whole mirth of our journey In the discovery of his love to you. His meat, his drink, his talk, his sleep, has all Been Doris, Doris, nothing but your remembrance Has been the trouble of his company; Ile tell thee at large hereafter. The fair Princess Is well you say. Dor. She was well when I left her, But subject to much passion: She is well And ill, and well again all in three minutes. Great Ladies may be so. But if I should Be sick and well, and sick again and well Again as oft as she; the world would say I had itâAnd had been a courtier, to some purpose. Var. They would say the Handmaid had been handled Would they? Dor. Like enough, but great ones must not be talk'd on so. Var. You have detain'd me to my undoing. See, my Lord! Enter Philocles. Dor. Ile send his sister to appease him. Exit. Philo. You have done ill Varillus to neglect A duty of that consequence, that I Expected in your quick return, was this A time to loyter? Var. My good Lord, the princess Is well again; restor'd to absolute health. Philoc. Tis happy news. But why was I delay'd In this accompt? was it too precious for me? Redeem your fault by some insuing service, Or you may lose a master, that has lov'd you. Ex. Var. I must proceed to gain Eudinas love From my Philargus or I loose my self. And gaining it, I must forgo Philargus, And equally be lost. O sister, welcome. Enter Placilla. I must request your aid. Pla. In any thing Wherein I may be useful, best of brothers. Philoc. I would intreat you be my advocate In love unto Eudina.âO, but hold, Shall I be treacherous unto my brother? A brother! What's a brother? A meer name; A title which we give to those that lodg'd In the same womb; so bedfellowes are brothers; So men, inhabiting one town, or countrey Are brothers too: for though the place containing Be greater, the relation is the same. A friend! I that's the thing I violate, Then which, nor earth nor heaven hath ought more sacred, Tis my Philargus, nay my self I injure, If I content my self. Pla. Why, brother Philoclesâ Did I say brother? How my tongue conspires To torture me! If Brother be a naked Title or name (as he suggests) I would It had nor being, name, nor title. Philocles Y'are passionate. Philoc. Fond reason I disclaim thee, Love is a strain beyond thee, and approaches The Gods estate: Friendship's a moral vertue Fitter for disputation, then observance. Eudina. O Eudina! In what price Art thou with me, for whom I cast away The Souls whole treasury Reason and Vertue? Placilla, you must wo Eudina for me. Do you startle at it? Pray do't, as you love me. Pla. If I were she you should not need an advocate. Philoc. I charge you by this kiss.â Pla. Your wages Corrupts your agent to be false. O whither; Into what Sands will the rash Pilot, Love? Drive this weak vessel? did I call it Love? Tis sooty, hellish fire; unlawful flame: Yet such as we may easier tax, then tame. Philoc. What troubles you Placilla? O you are Already entertain'd to mediate For him you better love, Philargus, do: He best deserves her; Ile wo for him too. Enter Doris. Dor. Madam, my Lady calls for you? My Lord The Princess has tane notice of your visit Exit Plac. And wishes you draw nearer if you please. Philoc. I meet that wish with swift, but fearful feet. My joyes are bitter, and my woes are sweet. Exit. Dor. I have heard men say when they on gamesters look (Though equally affected to both parties, Or both were strangers to 'em yet) they'l yeeld A secret inclination which should win. I am for Philocles, now, against Philargus, Who is as noble, and as free to me, As ever Philocles was. But tarry Doris; You have a bett upon the game I take it, Your love unto Varillus. If his Lord Rise to a Kingdom, you may hope to climbe The ladder of a Ladyship by the man. But not too fast: Here's one pursues the game That is as like to win. Why if he does? Enter Phlargus His follower Tersulus loves me past Varillus, And may as much advance me. But I love not Him, And the love of honour above husbands Has been so common among Ladies, that The fashions stale and ougly. Philar. So't must be. And so by transposition of my love I shall be quiet, and Philocles doubly happy. Doris, go seek my mother, and perceive If I may see the Princess. Dor. Yes my Lord. Exit. Philar. Love, thou art well compar'd to fire, which where It doth obey and serve being commanded By higher powers of the soul, it fares Like to the stone or jewel of a ring, Which joyns the orb, and gives it price and luster: So glorious is that love, so necessary. But, where it rules and is predominant, It tiranizeth; Reason is imprison'd; The will confined; and the memory (The treasury of notions) clean exhausted; And all the sences slavishly chain'd up To act th'injunctions of insulting love, Pearch'd on the beauty of a woman. Thou Masculine love, known by the name of friendship Art peaceful and morigerous: But that Of woman, is imperious and cruel. VVhy should I then lose Philocles for Eudina? Ent. Eudina. Thymile Eudi. reading a letter. Why? Can I look on her and ask a Reason? O the divinity of woman! sure There is no heaven without 'em. If the Gods Should thrust out Jove as he depos'd his Father And elect me to be their thonderer I'ld not drink Nectar to forgo Eudina. Thy. Fie, fie Philargus, y'are a slugish Lover. I have been careful for you, yea and partial Against your brother Philocles, to prefer Your love to his: And you to suffer him A whole hour opportunity before you! Philar. Has he been here? Thy. And is. Onely for you I have beguil'd him of her presence, that Till you have made first presentation Of love to her he shall have no access. Philar. Now Philocles, I suffer in thy injury; And to proceed in it were treachery. I would retireâBut that magnetique beauty To which are chain'd thousands of hearts and eyes Has captiv'd mine: nor must I seem to slight A mothers care. She's not the first (tis known) That of two sons hath best affected one. Thy. Why move you not Philargus towards the Princesse. Philar. Madam, you see she's busy. Eud. throws away the Letter. Eud. Stratoclesâ May thy ambition hoist thee into air; And thy loose wings, like thy licentious paper, There failing thee, let fall thy vicious body To earth, as here thy name lies to be trod on. Philargus, you are welcome. Philar. Princely Madam, That language from your gracious lips is powerful To save him from the grave, that onely lives By your free favours. Eud. Nay, my dear Philargus, I thought me nearer to you, then that you Should rove at me with Courtship. Stratocles (The emblem of whose pride lies there in paper) Shot from afar indeed; yet, like a Jove (A self-conceited one) presum'd to strike Love by command into me by his Letters. Philar. I cannot flatter pride, nor undervalue Abilities. 'Tis true that Stratocles Has been a useful servant to the State; But, doubtless, he would make as ill a Master. Eud. No more of him. Philar. Nor more be thought of him. And therefore Madam, by your fair command, To avoid all Court-circumlocutions, I tender thus my service, and crave hearing. Eud. You have it freely. Thy. To avoid all lets, I will withdraw my self. Exit. Philar. The King has graciously been pleas'd, in lieu Of my slain fathers services; and for love To us his sons, (by us much undeserv'd) To recommend unto your noble choice My brother and my self. You standing doubtful Whether to chuse, we to avoid dispute Of violating friendship, did implore The Councel of the Oracle to direct You in th'election. But the hidden sence In the dark sentence hath perplext both you And us with more anxiety. Eud. It is too true. Philar. Yet you are not prescrib'd; your choice is free. To take your lot in Philocles or me. We both, by strong injunction must pursue Your sacred Love, yet keep our friendship true. Then thus illustrious Madam. He kneels. Eud. Not so low. Philar. As low as future duty must compel me, When you shall be my Queen, let me beseech The favour that I seek and would obtain, Equal with heavenly bliss, to shine on Philocles. Eud. That he may be your King? Philar. May he prove so. Eud. Be all example lost. Philar. Friendship, with favour, may Hold between King and Subject: But one throne Cannot estate two Kings; Love's number's one. Eud. O my Philargus, you have open'd now The meaning of the Oracle. I have the sence Most perfectly. You have beyond example Preserv'd your friendship with your brother; and In wooing for him have won me to your self. I am your own. She kisses him. Philar. I am amidst the Gods. The wealth o'th'world, the beauty of the Heavens, And powers of both shall not redeem my interest. âProvided that I lose not Philocles. Ent. Philo. Thy. Pla. Eud. In that your constancy you win me more. Thy. Your importunity hath prevail'd. See Philocles, The Princess, and Philargus. Philoc. O, you are partial. He sinks. Pla. O help, my brother; speak, dear Philocles. Philar. Ye Gods, how comes this? Let me raise him up, Brother, and friend; speak, 'tis Philargus calls thee. Philoc. Philargus, let me go. 'Tis your advantage. Eud. Let me request the cause of your disturbance, Good Philocles. Philo. No other but my self. Honour'd Eudyna: For, who feeds to danger Upon a dish he loves, ought not to blame The meat, but his unbridled appetite. Pla. How do you now? What a cold moisture Spreads ore his temples here. Eud. Let me come to him: Thy. I can read his grief. Eud. What's that to the redress? Thy. The Delphian God, medcines inventor knowes That and not I. Eud. His grief's a jealous passion Upon my suppos'd favour to Philargus. Shake it off Philocles, I am thine, as much As ere I was, or his. Philoc. It is no jealousy Onely a fear Philargus had broke friendship: So, my souls better part exited, left The other languishing. Philar. Had you expir'd In that belief, and I had understood it, My shadow should have posted after yours Unto the Elisian fields to vindicate So causeless imputation. Thy. And because You charg'd my son with partiallity Let us remove, Philargus, come Placilla. Eud. You will not take him from me. Stay Philargus. Thy. What would you do with both? Philar. I may not stir, When she, whose power above me countermands The precepts of the Gods requires my stay. Thy. What not to give you brother Philocles An opportunity for equal hearing? Your grace will not deney't him. Eud. True, I may not. Philar. That spell convinces all. Friendships above, And must controul obedience, and love. Exit with Thym. &amp; Placil. Tis not to injure thee my dear Philargus, That here I linger, to oppose thy love; But to prefer it. Eud. What sayes Philocles? Philoc. To say I love you, Madam, with a zeal That dares to meet the tryal of Martyrdom, And suffer't for your sake, might get a name, A glorious one, and an immortal Crown: Yet so I should forgo (in leaving you On earth, a heaven on it) the bliss, Which, grieving, I should in Elisium miss. No, I will love you better then to die, And be mine own chief mourner; yet must crave, Under your gracious favour, leave to suffer More then a thousand deaths, that is, to live And part with my fair hopes in you for ever. Eud. What means my Philocles? Philoc. Princely Madam, Consider the necessity, which now By further search I gather from the hidden Oraculous perduit; by which I am tied Not to contend for you, that is, I must not Wound friendship in Philargus: But pursue My fortune, which is to gain love from you. For whom it sayes not, but the meanings plain, I for Philargus should your love obtain. The Gods deal after as they please with me, My sute is that you take Philargus. Eud. Oâ Philocles you have made a double conquest For you have got the victory of me Which was before assign'd unto Philargus. Your fortune thus embraces you she kisses him Philoc. This now, And with Philargus friendship were to me A fortune 'bove the envy of the Gods. Eud. He cannot disallow't. He woo'd me for you, And won me to himself, as you have now Suing for him. Philoc. I must not hold you then. His title, as his friendship precedes mine. Eud. Yet still the choice is mine. I may take you Without offence to him. But now he comes, Ent. Philar. Thy. Pla. And has again an equal interest, Strange love! In others absence I took either And lov'd each best; Now both at once appear, Neither is mine. Fate, let me die to one Rather then live in this confusion. Thy. Now Madam, whethers love do you approve. Eud. Confound me not with question. They are each Wedded to others friendship: Either is More studious for the other then himself. Philar. And ever must. Philoc. And will be. Eud. So will I For both of you then for my self. Thy. Alass. Eud. Then let's continue thus with Maiden love, With modest freedom, unsuspected joyes, As we had all been formed in one womb, Till Heaven determine of us. Ent. King and Eupathus. King. To determine Of you Eudyna, is by heaven committed In present unto me. On you depends The future glory and prosperity, Both of my house and Kingdom. Tis besides, Exacted of me by my near Allies, And by my Subjects (whom I must secure) To constitute a Successor: And no longer Will I expect your answer, then five dayes. By then you must declare who is your husband; Or else expect one from my self; the man Whose name I am as loth to mention As you to hear, even Stratocles. Eud. Nay, death first. King. Be you obedient; and by the way, Take my approvement of Lord Philocles, Not that I slight Philargus. Eud. Here's a mystery too, As dark as that from Delphos. He approves My choice of Philocles, slighting not Philargus. King. Come both you equal brothers; leave her to Her thoughts a while. Ambo. In all obedience. Ex. King, &amp;c. Thy. What strange amazement hath surpriz'd you Madam? No study, nor no strife can alter fate Or the decrees, the Gods determinate. A husband you shall have, be confident. Be, as you were; secure of the event, Till time produce it. Pla. Madam, be your self. Eud. Yet five dayes for love's war. Jove grant I have By then, to end the strife, a peaceful grave.

      <field name="fulltext">Act 3. Scene 1. Garrula. Geron. Gar. Would you thus offer, by your own disease To shorten your Mothers dayes? Or can you pine And I not grieve? or cannot grief kill me Do you think? Ger. A wise Philosopher Whilome did affirm, That women who have past the fire of love Have hearts, which grief can neither pierce, ne move. Gar. Son, your Philosophy fails you, as your love Blinds you: For Cupids fire I know may be Quench'd by old age: But grief's unquenchable. Sips her bottle. My tongue still falters with me (there's my grief) And there are not so many fadoms 'twixt A womans tongue and heart, but grief may find The bottom, but for care to keep it up By sending down an Antidote before it. Sips again. Ger. But Whilom did the love-sick Poet prove, No antidote against the power of Love. Gar. Forbear your Whiloms, and your old said saws, And since you are in love, and by that love Grown sick with the concealment. Ger. As Whilom Th'Anthenian boy who stole a fox did hide Under his coat his theft from being descried Until it tore his Gentalsâhis intrals I should have said. Gar. No more I say Of your disease, but to the cure, which is The love of Doris. How ha'you try'd her, son. Ger. By oratory, Epistles, and by gifts Which Whilome Ovid said were best of shifts. Gar. Yes, such a gift it might be, and so fastened. Ger. But she, as Whilom said Anominus Retorteth all with scorn injurious. Gar. Yet will you leave your Whiloms? And go seek My Lady Governess? say I would speak with her. Ger. But Whilome said Diogenes (tis true) To one that would, I will not speak with you. Gar. Will you say as I say; and do as y'are bidden? It is not her great Lady-ships daughters hand-maid Shall scorn my son while I know what I know. If you love Doris, run and tell her so. Ger. For Doris love, as Whilome DÃ¦dalus. I will take wing. But see I am prevented. Ent. Thymile. Thy. O Garrula! well found, I was in quest of you. Gar. And I was eene a sending for you, Madam. Thy. What an imperious beldam's this. But I Must humour her. Sending for me do you say? For what, good Garrula. Gar. Sending for you? Yes Madam, so I said, And sai't again. What, what, I know what I know. You know I do; and that there is no such Distinction 'twixt the honours of your birth And place; and mine of age and knowledge, but You might vouchsafe the summons when I send. Thy, What needs this Garrula? I am here you see. Gar. You know I know, and have deserv'd some favors, I do not bost for what. You know. Thy. O me! Who trust those secrets whereon honour rests To custody in Mercenary breasts Do slave nobility; and though they pay A daily ransom, nere redem't away. Pray let us be more private, though indeed I love your son for his great care of mine. Gar. O, do you so? Go forth son Geron, till I call. All shall go well Ile warrant thee. Ger. Whilom, so Said a Physitian, meaning to restore, And kill'd the Patient was but sick before. Exit. Thy. Why Garrula do you maintain a strife Still in my grieved mind 'twixt hope and fear? Cannot so many years of my known kindness Win yet a confidence of secresie. You are as deeply bound by oath too as my self. Gar. I do confess my oath, and would not break it; Yet, Madam, as you are a woman, you May know a broken oath is no such burthen As a great secret is; besides the tickling A woman has to in and out with't. Oh The tongue itche is intollerable! And were I A woman of tongue, as most are of my calling (Though Midwives ha'been held the best at secret Councel keeping) it had been out I fear. Thy. But still take heed dear Garrula. Gar. Yes Madam. Yet there are kindnesses requir'd on your part. Thy. Have I not still been kind? Gar. My memory serves me; and but that my tongue Now falters with meâI could recount Sips. All the rewards I have had from time to time, Since you translated me from a Country houswife, Into the Midwife Royal; what in Gowns, In Gold, in Jewels, Chains and Rings; and (which I prize 'bove all) my syrrops and my sippings. Sips. Thy. Your place of honour in the Courtâ Gar. What, what? I hope I had that before i'the Kings favour, As his Queens Midwife. She is in Elisium. Sip. Thy. Then Garrula your learned sons preferment, Tutor and Governour to my Sons. Gar. Thereby Hangs a tale, Madam. Now I come to th'point; My son affects your daughters hand-maid Doris, Who slights his love. I must now by your power Obtain her for my Son. Thy. Be confident, Though I confess I hold her worthless of him. Gar. I tell him so: But love has blinded him. Ho Geron, I say Geron, come and hear. Ent. Geron. Ger. So Whilome prisoners have been cal'd to come From dungeon deep to hear a blacker doom. Thy. Geron, be comforted. By all my power, Doris shall be your own. Ger. Then Whilome, as Ovid by his Corynna sweet, said oâ Ent. Doris. She comes, she comes. My joyes do overflow. Thy. Now Doris, what portends your hast? Speak Maid, Is it to Geron, or to me, your business? Dor. His ill looks, had almost made me miscarry't. Madam, the Princess instantly desires Your company. Thy. But by her Graces favour, And your leave, Doris, I will trench so far On both your patiences, and for your good, As to be witness of an interchange Of some few words twixt Geron and your self. Why look you from him so? he loves you, Doris. Dor. That's more then I ere knew, or read, by all He speaks or writes to me. He cloaths his words In furres and hoods, so, that I cannot find The naked meaning of his business, Madam. Thy. Speak plainly to her, Geron. Gar. To her Son. Ger. My business is the same, that Whilome drew Demosthenes to Corinth, some repentance, So I pay not too dear. Dor. Lo you there, Madam. Gar. You must speak plainer, Son. Thy. And be you kinder, Doris. Dor. But not so kind, good Madam, as to grant I know not what. Ger. O forfeit not the praise That Whilome Aristotle gave your Sex, To be inrich'd with piety and pitty. Dor. I know not what to pitty, but your want Of utterance. It is some horrid thing That you desire, and are asham'd to speak it. Ger. No, gentle Doris, nothing but the thing, Whereby great Alexander Whilome said, He knew himself a mortal, and no God, Coitionâ Dor. Be it what it will; I cannot Give what I understand not. Y'are too aloof. Gar. There's comfort, Son. And I'le give thee instructions To come more close to her. Thy. I'le ease your care, And be my self his Agent. Hee's too learned, Geron, you speak too learnedly, as if You woo'd a Muse: And Doris understands not, But by your posture, what you'ld have. I'le put Your meaning into womans words; and such As shall be sure to speed. But first I'le wait Upon the Princess. Garrula, will you go? Gar. And thank you for my Son: But stillâI know. Thy. Nay, I will do't Geron, be confident. Ger. I thank your Ladyship as much as they Who WhilomeâWhilomeâ Dor. Knew not what to say. Gar. He's overjoy'd. Thy. Go Geron, lead the way. Exeunt. omnes. Scene 2. King. Stratocles. Disanius. Justinius. King. Pray trouble me no further. I have said, That if in five dayes space she make not choice Of one of those whom (I must tell you Stratocles) She loves, and I prefer before you, then I'le weigh your suit, and reasons; and till then I say't again, you are a trouble to me. Str. A trouble Sir? That were a time that knew me, A trouble to your enemies, not you, When this same lump of earth (which now's a trouble) Stood a sole Bulwark of your Realm; repelling Arms of foes; shrowding your fearful Subjects Under my shield; guarding your fields and Vineyards From desolation; your Palaces from ruine; And am I now a trouble? Dis. Stratocles, You lose the glory of your deeds by blazing Your own renown. He that commends himself, Speaks upon trust, and is his hearers slave. Str. Peace, envy, and be thankful for thy life Which thy tongue forfeits. Just. Let my mildness tell you, You are irreverent before the King, Who has not been forgetful of your worth, Nor slow in your reward. Then moderate Your heat with counsel; and be first assistant Unto the publick good: So shall you merit The first regard in honours and affairs Of private nature. Sra. So. King. This Oracle Troubles me not a little. I had thought Thereby to have declin'd this weighty care From my declining shoulders, and have given My countrey satisfaction, and my self, In chusing of a son and successor. But I am prisoner in the Labyrinth Of the Gods verdict. Just. Their sublimity In matters of the future seldom stoops To humane apprehension; yet vouchsafes To answer our demands: but chides withall Our too much incenss with obscurity. Your grace however may presume, where they Shal deign to spend a word, and take an offering, It is a certain augury of good. King. Thou hast allay'd my fear. Justinus come, Lead me thy brains assistance. For in thee I find a temper that accords with me. Exit King Just. Dis. Souldier, I dare yet tell thee thou art rash; Foolish as valliant; and as easily may'st For all thy loftiness be undermin'd As the base bramble: Boasting weakness, thee And promising Ambition leads thee up An earthly exhalation into th'air; Where with a little borrow'd light, one moment, Thou shin'st the mark and wonder of all eyes; But soon consum'd and darted to the Center, Becom'st the scorn of men and sport of Children. Str. You are oth sect of Cinicks, and have learn'd To bark Philosophy. Dis. Then shall you hear Your now adorning multitude upbraid Your insolence and pride, and gain the name Of Prophets by your downfall, while one swears He had foretold it long; Another dreampt it; All joyntly cry we never could indure him; See what a look he has; what brawny lips; What poysonous eyes; and what an impudent front! Str. You will out-run your priviledge of prating And suffer for't. Dis. I am too prodigal Of seed upon so flinty soyl as thou. Be as thou art, and perish. Exit. Str. Ignorant wretch, That out of all thy bookish Theory Knowes not the soul to be Aerial And of a soaring nature; not unlike The noble Falcon that will never cease To work 'bove all that tops her. The supream Estate on earth, and next unto the Gods Is majesty; and that's my present gain, Though I have all but that, yet wanting that All is as none to me: And since my way Must be upon the Ruins (sowre Disanius) Of thee, and of thy glories in thy Nephews The Kings dear darlings, for whose pretious sakes I must attend five dayes (yet be a trouble) I'le travail through your bloods: Thy self has gi'n me The quicker motion by thy timely envy. Thou hast set spurs to the pale horse of death, That into dust shall trample all those lets Which stand twixt me and the Thessalian Crown, Enter Matho. Upon whose back I'le set this Rider. Mat. My soveraign Lord. Str. I like that compellation: Thou stil'st me as thou wishest me, on whom Depends thy consequent advancement, Matho. But we but dream of soveraignty and sleep To the Atchievement: something must be done With wackful eyes and ready hands my Matho. Mat. Now my King speaks himself. Let but your eye Find out the way these ready hands shall act The strength of your designs. I can perceive That now the labour of your Jove-like brain Is bringing forth the Pallas, shall inspire Me, to perform the work of my advancement. Str. Tis not yet ripe for the delivery, But thou shalt quickly have it. Follow me. Exit. Scene 3. Eudina. Thymele. Placilla. Eud. Good Madam, let me be excus'd. The mirth You offer'd to allay or quench my sorrows Might have been well receiv'd at former times: But now it is unseasonable. Thy. Yet think on't, Madam, How gravely Geron goes, and with what scorn The wanton Girl recoyles. Eud. Good, speak no more on't. Thy. Then Beldame Garrula's reasons urging Doris. Shewing how either of his pupils grace In your electing Philocles or Philargus, Though to them doubtful, is a sure advancement To her by Geron. Eud. Still you move like those That do in merry tales mis-spend their breath To those that are that day mark'd out for death. Thy. You may not say so (Madam) tis in you By taking one, to give new life to two; Your self, and if you'l give me leave to name The other, be it Philargus: or, if chance Shall favour better, Philocles or him, Let it be him that gives you the first visit. Eud. That were to fancy in our selves an Oracle; Or to give fortune power, to execute The judgement of the Delphian God. Thy. Who knowes But that his Oracle would have it so. Pla. Was it for that you now sent for Philargus. Aside Thy. Say, shall it be so Madam; or suppose so? Eud. This pleases better yet then Gerons wooing. Praythee Placilla sing. And may thy voice Attract him that may prove the happier choice. Pla. Ile try my best in notes, and what they want Ile strive to make effectual in my wishes. Eud. Thanks kind Placilla.âBut the leaden weights Of sleep oppress mine eye-lids, and I shall not hear thee. Thy. Yet sit, and let her sing: you'l sleep the better. Placilla Sings. After a strain or two, Eudina sleeps, and enters, as a vision at the several doors, Philargus and Philocles; They meet and embrace affectionately: then whisper a while: Then sudenly start off, and draw their swords: menace each other, and severally depart. The song ended, Eudina affrightedly starts up. Eud. Stay Philocles, stay Philargus. Let not fury Lead you to end that difference with your swords, Which onely fits my life to satisfie. Thy. What means your Grace. Eud. Pursu 'em, with prevention, Before they meet again, or one or both Must perish; did you not observe their challenge, And eithers daring other to the field? Thy. Who Madam, where? and when? Eud. Now; here; your sons. How can you ask? Thy. Because we were awake And saw nothing. Pla. Collect your spirits Madam: you slept. Eud. It was an omenous dream then. Thy. And of good, I dare divine it Madam. And now see Enter Philargus. Whom fortune first hath sent to be your choice. Philargus, you have won the glorious prize. Philar. But dos the glory of the world, Eudina, grant it. Eud. My affrightment shakes me stillâ O my Philargus, I am now inspir'd Sure by a vision from the Gods, with knowledge, That, in my choice of you, or Philocles, I shall become the ruin of you both. Philar. Tis not in fate to wound our common friendship. Eud. Tis better in my self to kill the danger. Philar. The Gods avert such purposes. If you Deprive the world of your fair self, then we Both fall by necessary consequence. But what are we? This Thessaly must suffer. The King must yield, to see a new and strange Succession appointed to his Crown; And by his subjects, not himself. Eud. Tis that Deters me: yet let me prevail Philargus (To quit me of my fears) that ere I passe My faith unto a husband, your and Philocles, Before the Gods, your Mother, and my self, Once more, do celebrate your vow of Friendship. And let me be excus'd in this: for I Must tell you, dear Philargus, that tho' now My love be fixt on one of you (albeit I name not which) I will not take him with Least scruple of a fear of losing him Again by th'others spight; nor leave that other Lesse lov'd by me, then now he is, for ever; And tho but one can be possess'd of me One friendship, yet, must marry us all three. Philar. The Gods have spoke it in you; it is their Divine injunction; Madam, I obey it, And dare engage as much for Philocles. Thy. This is most fair: now, till you meet, tis fit You fall on lighter purposes for your health. Son, here was mirth to day; although the Princesse Relish'd it not. Philar. I heard of Gerons love To his fair Doris. We are now become His Tutors, Madam, to be amorous. Thy. Placilla, come you hither. I observe A change in you of late; and do suspect The Reason. What! Do you blush at my suspition? Nay then you mak't my knowledge. You are in Love. I'le yet come nearer you. I guesse with whom: And at fit time I'le school you for't. Eud. Come Madam; Now if you please wee'l take some ayr. Philargus Craves leave to seek his brother. Philar. Yes Madam. Thy. I wait o'your Grace. Nay, do not look displeas'd: I tell you Girl, there is danger in it. Exit Eud. Thym. Philar. Stay Placilla. What! has my Mother chid you. I'le not question Her Reason, nor your fault; but pray thee sister If Philocles approach to see the Princesse Ere my return, tell him I stay at's lodging, First, to confer with him. Pla. I will my brother. Philar. Introth thou weepst. Therefore to comfort you, Because I know by some infallible signes, You are more tender of his Love then mine. He stands in equal competition yet With me for fair Eudina. And if Fortune Allots her me, I'le be as kind a brother And stil the same to you as Philocles. I pray thee dry thine eyes. Ent. Matho disguised with a letter. Mat. If a disguis'd face and a counterfeit hand Ever prevail'd, may these in this plot speed. Philarg. reads My Lord, I had this in charge to render to you. Ex. Matho Pla. I am discover'd in my lawlesse love. Remember, Cupid, whom thou makest thy Anvil; A poor weak virgin. If thou art a God, Be just and reasonable: It savours not Of justice, to provoke incestuous flames, Nor Reason to enforce an Ardency Of things impossible. Let me not burn With neighbouring fire, which, to enjoy, I must Therefore dispair because it is so near. Philar. Ha! where's this fellow? is he gone? Pla. Yes, brother. Philar. Tis Philocles his hand! An eager challenge! A challenge, and to me, his friend and Brother. Now Oracle, where's your Riddle? Answer me, Apollo's fiddle-stick. O ye Delphian Priests, You hang religion up, like painted cloaths Before unseemly walls, to cloak their filth And palliate their wicked misteries. Pla. How do you brother? Philar. Sick in Philocles. You'l hear more of his kindness to you shortly. Exit. Pla. He suspects too, with much displeasure, my Unreasonable Love to Philocles. But why should we be Reasons followers With loss of liberty? which of the Creatures Allayes his heat toward any of his kind, 'Cause the same belly gave them being? They Observe no difference of Sire, or Dam, Brother, or Sister, being mature for love. Ah, whither am I going? Bestial thoughts Forth of my bosom; Leave me not my Soul, Or my soules better part, my reason. Oh It was returning but a flaming shaft Enter Philocles. Of love has set it's Mansion afire And frights it back again. Philoc. Placilla. Sister. Pla. That name of Sister, like a violent cold Upon an extream heat, feavers my blood To death. Philoc. Me thinks you are sad and troubled sister. Why thus alone? Or have you entertain'd That troublesome companion, Love? Come tell me, I can advise you very learnedly: For Cupids Scholars are more exquisite In giving councel then in using it. Pla. How shall I answer him? I dare not look on. Philoc. Why are you sad. Pla. Out of conformity Unto the present garb: I have assum'd Onely a veil of sadness. Philoc. Thou art onely happy, Whose sorrow is but outward, as a stranger Call'd to be present at a funeral Clads himself like the rest, is serious, And silent with a countenance dejected, And Testudineous pace; but has not tears, No groanings for a loss to him unknown: The Obsequies performed uncloaths himself Of griefe and weeds together. But my sister, You are not pleas'd to talk upon this subject. Where is the Princess? Pla. He'has given me now a Colour for my sadness. The Princess is retir'd; She has been troubled With a most fearful dream of a Duello Betwixt you and Philargus to be fought. Philoc. With friendly Courtesies? Pla. Nay, with swords she said. Philoc. Ha, ha, ha. Pla. Philargus hath been with her, and to him She told her fears, enjoyning him, that both Of you should come, and jointly before her Declare your constant friendship. Philoc. That's soon done. Pla. But trust me Sir, I fear Philargus took not All as she meant it; for at his departing, He look'd displeasedly; and, when I demanded His healths condition, he said he was sick In Philocles. Philoc. In Philocles his absence, As I am in his. That was his meaning sister. Pla. Pardon my fear; which is, that hee's not friends w'ye. Pheloc. Away, your fear has made you idle. Pla. No. It is my love, in that black horror clad, Which will, before it leaves me, make me mad. Exit. Philoc. Ile seek him out. Enter Matho disguis'd, a Letter. Math. My Lord, I was commanded To convey these into your Lordships hands. Philoc. By whom were you imploy'd? Math. My Lord 'twas not The man that mov'd me. For I know him not; But the reward. I humbly take my leave. Exit Philoc. My brother write. Ha! Are we at such distance? Thou art no Prophetess, Placilla, art thou? He Reads. Brother Philocles, we are the laughing stock of the Nation; and injurious both to the King, our Countrey, the divine Eudina, and our selves, by our childish love. The time is short, meet me, (I conjure you by our Friendship) within three hours, in the North vale of Tempe; where it shall be the Gods election to take one of us, and leave the other for Eudina. Expostulate not with your self, much less with me otherwise then by weapon, or never expect to see your Brother Philargus. O Gods and men! where shall we go to find Friendship and truth? Bee't so: For in th'event We may be happy both: But with this ods; One with Eudina, tother with the Gods. Exit. Explicit Actus Tertius.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 4. Scene 1. Varillus. Tersulus. Var. We should love one another, brother Tersulus, More inwardly, and be in friendship true As our Lords are. Prithee let their example Piece up all difference betwixt us. Ter. Piece up, I know your meaning and your jear Varillus, In your piece up. Var. Fie on thy jealousie. 'Cause thou art a Taylor, How ere a Gentleman by place, thou think'st I jear thy quality. Ter. You should not. For Look back unto the worlds beginning; there Youl' find a Taylor was before a Barber. Var. Nay if you go to rip up old Antiquity. Ter. Rippe! there he is again. Var. You may as well Collect, that the first man (who you suggest Was his own Taylor) was his own Barber first. Ter. As how? Var. Do you think he did not scratch his head In casting how to fashion out his breeches? And that's in part, you know, the Barbers office. Ter. The scraching of the head. Var. And still In use 'mongst Taylors on themselves. But note The foul corruptions brought in by Time; Of old they did but rub invention up, How to contrive their work: But now their heads Wrists, fingers, all have got an itch by't, which Nothing but stealing can allay; though that Can never cure it. Ter. Lying and stealing went Of old together: now they are shar'd it seems Between the Barber and the Taylor. Var. Sharp. Ter. Your instruments are sharp as mine, Sir Barber, And you can pick more out of your Lords ears Then I take from his Garments with my sheers. Var. Agree good brother, or would we had Doris To stickle twixt us. There y'are afore me too. Var. But come, Lords followers are their Apes in most things, Why should not we be as friendly Rivals, now In Doris Love, as are our Lords in the Princess Eudinas. We will take up a fashion. Enter Doris Dor. Varillus, where's your Lord? Var. I know not Doris. Dor. Tersulus, where's yours? Var. I know not Doris. Dor. You Eccho one another. Y'are commanded Both by the Princess and the Governess To seek 'em out. Both. Your love commands our stay. Dor. Coupled together? Go yet one of you. You I can spare best. Var. Why him? Dor. You then. Ter. Why him? Dor. Do you conspire? I will return your care. Ter. Nay gentle Doris stay. For, tis in vain To seek our Lords. They are both rod singly forth To take the Air. Mine an hour since. Var. Mine even now. I came but since to call My brother Tersulus. Dor. Your brother Tersulus? Ter. As deeply vow'd in friendship as our Lords are. Var. It is with us as tis with them: we both Are brothers, friends; yet Rivals in your love. Can you now, as the Princess is to them, Be equally affected to us both? Dor. Do you stay me to abuse me. Var. Nay, dear Doris. We love our Lords? and as you love the Princess, Who loves them, love you us. You are Eudina, I Philocles, and he Philargus is. Dor. Are the men mad. Ter. Suppose so Gentle Doris. Var. The King commands you to make present choice Of one of us, or else ambitious Stratocles (That's Geron) must enjoy you. Now sweet Princess Be speedy in your choice. The kingdoms good Depends upon it. And in your Election, O make Philargus blest: He best deserves you. Ter. Admired friend, and brother Philocles, Your courtesie ore-comes me: I must sue, Though my heart akes the while as much for you. Dor. This is fine foolingâ Good Barber Philocles, and Taylor Philargus, You shall not need to trim up his Affection, Nor you to stich up his with your forc'd courtesies. I know, in this, each wooes but for himself, And my Affection runs as even betwixt you, As nothing but your sizors, or your sheares Had parted. Var. See Stratocles, alias Geron. Enter Geron. Ger. So Whilome did contend two warlike Princes For a fair Iland, till a powerful King Subdu'd them both and it. Doris, take heed, Be wary in your conversation (As Whilom Tully warn'd his tender son) With such Plebeians, least their vulgar breeding Corrupt your education. Var. Must she be Your pupil learned Geron. Ger. And my self Her onely study; such as Whilome was; Ulysses to Penelope. Var. Take heed Doris How you become his wife: For he will love you So by the book, as he will never lie with you Without an Authour for't. Ger. Sir, she shall be More precious to me then Homers Iliads, Whilome to Alexander, which he made His mighty bed-fellow: But why stand I To render this account? The Princesse sent you, Doris, to call their Lords to walk with her, And take the air of Tempe. Ter. They are gone to take the air already, sir. Ger. Come you with me then, Doris. Dor. And why with you Antiquity? I have heard you all this while, And though you boast you have an interest in me, We are not yet one volume, both bound up And clasp'd together. Var. She speaks in his Element. Dor. No, I am yet loose paper; and 'twere good To keep me so; for when I'm bound I must Obey, be search'd, examin'd and corrected. Yet this I'le do, and now be serious, If you will all obey my rule; and try Your fortunes who shall have me. Var., Ter. We agree. Ger. Their merits bear no Ã¦quability With mine. Var. A very Stratocles. Dor. You boast your worth, and stand on confidence In powerful advocates: But what are all Unto my Love, and (which is more) my will? If you will hear my proposition, hear it. Var., Ter. We are agree'd. Pray hear't. Ger. Lets hear it then. The Gods, in Love, Whilome have stoop'd with men. Dor. That you all love me, I believe; and am Content that every one of you do think Himself prime man in my Affection: And one of you I'le take. But yet my choice Must wait upon Eudina's. Therefore mark If your Lord wins the Princesse, and becomes The Kings immediate Heir, I will be yours; If your Lord, yours. Ger. Therein the oddes is mine, For they are both my Lords. Dor. Then if both have her, I'le be yours: not else. Ger. As Whilome said, None of the wisest Clerks, When the Sky falls we shall have store Dor. Of Whilomes: Ha, ha, ha. Var. Ter. Ha, ha, ha. Ger. Your Mistresse, Lady, Princesse, and my Mother Shall know yourâ Dor. Away, old Whilome. All. Ha, ha, ha. Ger. Your Lords too I'le acquaint. Dor. Away, old child, Go tell it Mother, do. If you had spent, in the Phylosophers school Your time no better, then in Cupids Lectures, What a strange dunce you had been. Tell her, Love shows In you, as Whilomeâshe knows what she knows. Ger. Your Love I will forget; your scorn remember In black revenge, and soâ Dor. Farewel December. Var. Hee'l to his Mother now. But tell me, Doris, What means that Beldame in she knows, she knows: She's often up with't to the Governesse. Dor. It has relation to some uncouth passage Betwixt them, in my Ladies youth I guesse. Var. Tis some smock-secret I believe. But Gentlemen, You know how I have laid my self out to you. Ter. That, as the Princesse shall bestow her self On eithers Lord; you will embrace his man. Dor. Right. Var. And to that you'l hold? Dor. Yes and hold you This for a Creed, That heaven must make its choice Of one of them, before she take the other. You understand me; and now cease your strife: When th'ones Lord's dead, I'le be the others wife. So farewel Gentlemen. I have staid too long. Var. She has given us both a hint now, would we take it. Dor. You did not hear me say, Kill you his Lord, Nor you kill his. Exit. Var. But she has laid a ground To end a strife, that I should nere ha'found. Ter. Varillus, come, our Lords may be return'd: And we be shent for loytering. Var. I must think on't. Exit. Scene 2. Matho in his disguise. Mat. Now for my Combitants. Th'appointed ground Is here; the time draws on; and the event Foreseen in my imaginary light Of every passe projected in their fight. In the first passage, each shall wound the other; Then shall they give, lend, pay, change wound for wound, Till both of them lie fainting on the ground. Holding between their teeth their doubtful lives: When I, to end the question, friendly come in, And with an equal hand dispatcht 'em both. Ent. Philarg. And so into my ambush. One approaches. Exit. Philar. This is the place. What is't that urges me So promptly to deed, which being acted, Will be th'astonishment of Heaven and earth? Applauded no where but in Hell. Fair Tempe, Let it not be deriv'd to after Ages, By any uncouth mark upon thy face, Let not thy grassy locks, that shall receive The drops of blood, wither and die, condemning The place that bore them to continual baldness; Let not the impress of our labouring feet Hold it's proportion; nor that part of earth, Whereon the slain shall measure out his length, Reserve the stamp, and make it monumental, By a perpetual spring of more procere And bigger bladed grass: And, when my soul Hath found an Exit (which my purpose is My Brothers sword shall open) let the valley (When hee's departed) sink and undermine The bordering hills that they may cover me. Ent. Philoc. Philoc. He hath prevented me in hast: In death I shall prevent his happily expected Labour and toy'l, who for no other end Am here arriv'd but to be sacrific'd For expiation of his discontent. Philar. Let all the eyes of heaven be hooded, onely One star to guid his point unto my heart, Which instantly shall fall, and be extinct In my distilled blood; that so the Gods May not behold him. May some magick spell Instruct his arm and weapon how to slay My name and memory, that of me, there be not Any desire; on him no Imputation. Philoc. My cure is onely how my breast may swallow His point, without revealing mine intent. Philar. I so't shall be: a violent assay For provocation; and then spit my self Upon his steel. They espie one another draw, and pass at each other, instantly both spread their arms to receive the wound. Philoc. Philargus. What! so quick, Philar. What's meant by this? Philoc. That should be my demand Philar. Are you so changeable? Philoc. Not I Philargus. Philar. This was my resolution; Will you stain The reputation rais'd of your high valour. Philoc. I came to make experiment of none But what consists in suffring. Philar. That's my part. Philoc. My self If you deny me that last friendly office. Phila. Brother you dally with me. Therefore I conjure you By faire Eudina let your anger loose; Break up this cask of blood, and give the earth A draught unto her health. Philoc. By the same Beauty (Then which no greater subject of an oath) I swear to be your nuptialls sacrifice, Be you the Priest. I'le suffer without noise In my displayed bowels you shall read An augury of bliss unto you both. Philar. This is hard measure, Philocles, to mock Ere you destroy. Philoc. I'le mock no more. Adieu. He offers to kill himself, Philargus closes with him. They strugle, and both fall down, still striving to hold each others sword. &amp;c. Philar. Hold, hold, and be not prodigal of that blood, More precious then Pactolus golden streams. Philoc. Was then your challenge but to try me onely? Philar. Yours was, it seems; but none went out from me. Philoc. Then are we both ensnar'd by treachery. Enter Matho. Math. This I foresaw 'twould come to. 'Save ye lordings. And whither travail ye? Do you not want a guide To help ye on your way? Martho draws they start up and disarm him. Philar. This is the villane That summon'd me. Philoc. And me. Villane, what art thou? Math. Unhappily gues'd. I pray inquire no further. Philar. What monster art thou? Philoc. Unworthy on thy face to bear mans ensign. Who has subborn'd thee? See tis Stratocles man. He unbeards him. Philar. Die villane, die. And were thy master in thee, The thirst of whose ambition sought our bloods; His flesh with thine should here become a prey Unto the Ravens. Math. O, be pitiful And spare my life, my Lords, and I'le reveal Matters of weight and wonder; which, conceal'd, Will yet cost both your lives, and make the Princess, If she not answer my Lords fierce desires, Subject to rape and murder. Philoc. How can she So fall into his power. Philar. We shall abuse The trust the Gods have put into our hands If we neglect to execute justice on thee. Math. Let me but warn ye of Eudina's danger, Whereby her virgin Innocence may not suffer, And then inflict your furies on me. Philoc. That charms our ready hands and steel. Speak quickly. Math. This very hour she's to be surpriz'd By my Lord Stratocles, here, on Tempe plains, Where she is come to walk, slenderly guarded To take the air. He with a strength will seise her And hurry her hence unto his Mansion house, To yield to his desire, or death, if suddenly Prevention be not made. Philar. Tis worth our care. Math. Preserve me from his vengeance, and I'le bring you Unto his enterprize. Philoc. We must not trust him, He may have laid an Ambuscado for us. Enter 6 Rust. with Weapons Philar. See brother, stand upon our guard. Math. Help, help, aid me good people, help. Philoc. What means the villan now. 1. Rus. What's the complaint? 2. Rus. What is your grievance, speak? Math. I am a servant to Lord Stratocles Who has preserv'd your Countey and your lives. 1. Rus. We are the more beholding to him; on. 2. Rus. 'Twas more his gentlenes then our deserving; on. Math. These two are his malignant enemies; And finding that my Lord is in these parts Together with the Princess, fair Eudina (Who has made him her choice) they lie in wait To murder him, as they had me, had not The Gods sent you to rescue me. 1. Rus. 'Twas more their Gentleness, then your deserving, on. Math. I have no more to say, but that you take 'em On your allegiance to safe custody, And let me pass. 1. Rus. Un'ch, That would be more Our gentleness then your deserving too. on, on. Philar. Dear friendsâ 1. Rus. Good, interrupt us not we'll hear ye in order. On you, Sir, ere you go; and come not back For any thing unspoke you left behind. Math. I thank you, Sir, I had like to ha'left my sword Behind, which they disarm'd me of. 1. Rus. That was their Gentleness more then your deserving, (They having three swords, and you none to guard you) They kill'd you not indeed, yet on again. What further do you charge 'em with. Math. No more, nor you, less you detain me longer. 1. Rus. Now you grow bold, and saucy I must tell you. 2. Rus. Now y'are a knave, a villane and a Traytor, Lest you no more behind you but a sword? I saw a scabberd on your face of late, A false one: Seek it out. 3. Rus. O here it is. Takes up the false beard. 1. Rus. Put it him on again. On with it, on. Resist and we will hang thee. Now my Lords, My Princess I may say: For one of you Must be our King. We know you though you know Not us; you may perhaps hereafter know us More by your Gentleness then our deserving. Phil. Phil. O worthy Countrey men. 1. Rus. We are the heads of Tempe; and the chief Swain heads of Thessaly (the King has known us) And here we came to lay our heads together For good of common wealth. Here at the verge Of this adjoyning Thicket is our Bower Of consultation; and from thence (regardful Ever with eye and ear for common good) We saw a beard pull'd off; and heard that mouth, (Which now is dumb) open a plot, unlike The pittiful complaint he made to us. Philar. But saw you not some passages before? Of his attempt upon our lives? 1. Rus. Good Gods. 2. Rus. No we came in but then. Those are enough To hang the man, and turn his Lord out of Our Countrey favour: If we find he has That plot upon the body of the Princess Of Rape and Murder. He can be no King For us: for, sirrah, we have wives and daughters. En. Stra. Eud. Soul. 1. Rus. Stand close. See who comes here. Stra. So, now go back my friends. There's some reward. gives a purs Sol. Thanks to the noble bounteous Stratocles. Strat. Lady your tears are bootless. Exit Souldiers Eud. Help ye Gods. Str. Your cries as unavailable. The Gods (To whom your friendly foolish lovers Have sacrific'd each other) have given you up To me the onely worthy of you. Eud. No they are both sublim'd into one star, Yet of a double influence, that shall Strike death into thy purposes, and give Me light by which t'ascend with them to live After my present death. She offers to kill her self with a knife, he holds her. Str. Your hast to death shall not prevent my lust. Philoc. She must outlive thy Lust and the false Traytor. Rus. Hold, hold, disarm, but kill him not. 2. Rus. Wee'll keep him tame. Str. You have ods o'me. Eud. I am in heaven already. Philar. Live wonder of the heavens, a star on earth Out shining theirs. Eud. What a short journey 'tis For heavenly minds to reach unto the Gods! Str. Betray'd! 1. Rus. No not betray'd. Y'are but well meet my Lord, But that's our Gentleness more then your deserving. Str. Am I become the shame and scorn of pesants. 1. Rus. Or if you'l ha't betray'd, then blame your own Overmuch policy and want of Beasts To carry it to Market. We nere lay More burthen on a Asse, then he can bear Here in the countrey: what is done at court We know not. Here perhaps is one can tell, Know you this bearded Satyre? Pull off Mathos beard. Str. Coward, slave, Thy faintness hath betray'd me. Math. No, 'twas ods, Such as men meet that sight against the Gods. 1. Rus. The fellow has some Grace; he weeps: But come Princess and Princes, what is now your pleasure We do unto these men? Eud. For me, I have learn'd By mine own sufferings in my afflictions To be compassionate. I wish their pardon. Str. That mercy wounds me deeper with remorse Then all my lost designs, and their derision Have done with indignation. 1. Rus. There is some hope these yet may prove new men. Eud. Lord Stratocles, Those wounds that pierce the heart with true contrition Do bring the precious balm in 'em that cures it. Philar. We wish yours may be such. Philoc. And that this shame May guard you innocent of future blame. 2. Rus. Here's sweetness upon sweetness. 1. Rus. Now it remains, that we advise our selves, Brethren of Tempe, that since these delinquents Are fallen into our hands, that we discharge Our Countrey loyalty with discretion, And not release him from our power, but by The power above us. (that's the kings) wee'l wait On you to court. On you for your new loves, And you for old acquaintance. Eud. I'le acquaint my father with your care, He shall be witness of our bringing in The ambitious Politick trapt in his own gin. Scene 3. King. Disanius. Justinius. King. Bereft of all my joyes and hopes at once! Is there no comfort, nor no counsel left me? Why stand you gazing thus with sealed lips? Where is your counsell now, which you are wont In trifling matters to pour out in plenty? Now, in the peril of my life and state I cannot get a word. Give me my daughter, Or take my Kingdom too. Where is she? Tell me. Dis. All we can say or hear is, she was taken Out of her private walks by violent hands, Onely we guesse the master of the plot Was Stratocles, who now is missing in the Court. King. He ask'd my leave to leave the Court, and had it. Dis. Twas a fit glosse for his fowl treachery. King. But what ha' you said for her recovery. Just. We have dispatch't a hundred several posts To every coast and angle of your Kingdom: No way of finding her is left unsought. Dis. Could we finde Stratocles, she might be found. King. Stil upon him? Where's Philocles? where's Philargus? They are missing too. Dis. Hell has not in't a thought That can detract their honours. Jus. Yet a Rumor Is spread about the Court; they are gone to fight. Dis. 'Gainst whom? Jus. Against themselves. Nay more, that they Have fought, and both are slain. Dis. You may as soon Believe the Artick and Antartick poles Can meet it opposition, amidst The firmament, and jointly in a fall Extinguish both their lights in Neptunes bosom. King. Whence springs this Rumor. Dis. Stratocles is the head We may be confident; and his men the pipes That have dispers't it. Kin. Stil you judge Stratocles. Ent. Thym. weeps. What purpose can he have in't. Dis. O my sister Has heard the news too. Weep not tender sister, Your sons are safe. Thy. Yes they are with the Gods. King. And, had they tane Eudina with them too, My doubts and fears were over, well as yours. Ent. Garr. weeping Dis. Here's one that makes a face, an ugly one, And would weep too, had she but moisture in her. How now! Whose Mare's dead, Garrula? Take thy bottle And turn that into tears. Or dost thou wring Thy face because that's dry? Gi'mee't, I'le fill it. Gar. My son, oh, oh my son is at deaths door. Dis. And is death so unkind to keep it shut Against him? Out upon him churle. Gar. My liege And Madam (it shall out) you might have sav'd My sons life in your servants love, whose scorn Will be his death, except the King divert it, And I shall tell him what you know I knowâ Thy. O me undone. Gar. And open such a secret Unto his majestyâ King. Yet forbear me now. Gar. Do you slight me in the care of my sons life? Do you scorn my secret too, that may be worth More then your kingdom to you? Dis. Away old fool. Gar. Now you shall never know't. Dis. For thy good wil The king would thank thee, in offering at some mirth To cool his grief, but that it is too hot Yet to be touch'd. Jus. Indeed you do not well To move the King, or to perplex the Lady Now in their sorrows fulness. Gar. What's their sorrow To mine? My sons a dying. Jus. Her sons are dead, And the Kings daughter lost. Gar. But I pray, say, Is my Lord Philocles and Philargus dead? Jus. 'Tis said so. Gar. Then I say my son shall live. Dis. And so wilt thou while thou canst lift thy bottle To that old Mazer. Gar. Hem! A hem! a ha! Dis. Do you rejoyce, and shew the rotten half tooth You have left that they are dead. Gar. No I rejoyce That the advancement that the giglet gap'd for In one of their fine followers is lost, In hope of which she scorn'd my son. But now He shall scorn her and live. Dis. Out envious trot Gar. Ile comfort him with the newes. Dis. away you Hag, Exit Gar. Here comes one merry look. Eup. Joy to the king. Enter Eupa. Dis. Well said, speak up and home good Eupathus. Eup. Your daughter's safe return'd so is your son, Madam, For which you are to thank the Gods: This is Their true relation. He gives the King a paper. He reads to Thym. aside. Dis. Where is Stratocles? Eup. Caught in the snares of his foul treachery. Dis. Bravely and honestly spoken Eupathus. Eup. And by their hands whose voices he had once For his election. Dis. What his country heads? Eup. They all turn head upon him now. Dis. Brave heads Observe my judgement now, my king: Those heads I will so souse in our best Greekish Wines, That they shall be such heads! O heads, heads, heads! King. I do approve your judgment good Disanius, But wish you not insult ore mans dejection. We find that Stracocles is much Penetent And troubled at his trespass. Dis. A halter still him For an ambitious hypocritical Traytor. King. The time for my Eudina's match draws near, And I no longer will attend on fortune, I have decreed it past recal, regardless Whether against the oracle, or with it. Thy. Yet am I confident in your assertion You priests of Delphos. Dis. Hee'l bestow her yet On Stratocles, if she stand longer doubtful In a fair choise. Eup. Fear not my Lord. That doubt Your Countrey heads will clear. He has lost them For ever. Dis. O brave heads! I will so ring Their ears with jewels of praises and preferment That they shall glare like direful comets at him. King. One she shall chuse of them: If not, I'le put A third upon her. Thy. With your pardon Sir, Why are you (for I find it is so) stronger For Philocles? King. No reason urges me; And yet I find an inclination in me That pleads for him. I can perceive you too, Are partial towards Philargus. Can you yield A reason for't? Thy. Yes, Sir, he is my eldest. King. Alas, But not an hour. Well, I'le remit My power propounding, and accept Her choice of either, made within the time. Thy. I, there my hopes do anchor; else they were Certain of Ship-wrack: yet the perillous waves My vessel rides on seems so many graves. Explicit Actus Quartus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 5. Scene 1. Philocles. Philargus. Philoc. Brother, and friend, I'm deaf to all deswasion. I charge you by Eudina's love, our friendship, And (if there be) ought that you hold more sacred, Move not to alter my fix'd resolution. Philar. That resolution's mine; And I conjure you By the self-same respects, and all that are Or may be hollowed, to let me depart. I will remove but for some few daies journey Whence you shall duly hear from me: But rather I'le travail to th' Antipodes, then here Linger the vain impediment of your joyes In your Eudina. Philoc. Travel's my design. Eudina must be yours. She is a bliss Which heaven created for you. Philar. Can a bliss Be purchas'd with your absence? No: 'Twill torture Equally in fruition as in want. Were it a Kingdom onely, we could part it Without the quarrel of the Thebean brothers; Or, were it heaven it self, Castor and Pollux Should have our imitation. But Eudina Is onely indivisible. Philoc. Add to it this, Their sentence is erroneous, that deny Partition to the soul: For ours do witness, Friendship can give her a division, And make reciprocal community Of all her faculties. But still Eudyna Is indivisible. Why name I her, Whom to forget must be my onely tasque? Brother adieu. Philar. 'Tis I that must take leave. Enter Disan. Dis. Is it even so? Philoc. I fear we are prevented. Dis. Nephews, why left you so the presence? I May justly fear you were ill advis'd in it. The King expects your quick return, and will not Let pass this peremptory day, set down For matching of his daughter; to preserve Life, State, or Kingdom. Have you a purpose, First having beg'd that villain Stratocles pardon, To give him up your interest in the Princess? The Kingdom too, to boot? will you compel The King to give him all? Philar. Not so good Uncle. Dis. What do you less in flying from the presence, When that affair is now in agitation? Philoc. Uncle, you saw withal the great destraction We left the Princess in. How when she look'd Upon Philargus, she inclin'd to him; And when on me to me; when on us both How extasied she fell! Philar. A strong necessity There is that one of us absent. Dis. Therefore You both flie off to travel several wayes! Come, let me tell you, your courtesie is foolish, And you unworthy to have such a fortune Hang like a pregnant cloud over your heads Ready to be dissolv'd in showres upon you, While your own madness conjures up a wind To blow't away. Philar. Uncle, you are unjust, I would remove to let that golden showre Light upon Philocles. Philoc. I upon Philargus. Dis. I could even swadle 'em both for a brace of Babyes. Your folly makes me mad: will you return Yet to the presence, both of you? Philoc. Uncle, you know To be both there, is neither to be there, But to breed more perplexity in Eudyna. Pray take Philargus. Dis. Nephew, come, be wise: It is a crown that Courts you; and the name Of friend, or Brother ought to stand aloof, And know a distance, where such dignity Is tendred. Take your opportunity, I find you coming, come. Philarg. I pray take Philocles. Dis. I'le take him for the wiser man then. Nephew, Come, and embrace your fortune, and forget not To thank the Gods your Brother has no more wit. A Kingdom and a beauteous bed-fellow (There Nephew, there!) Do not those bare a sound 'Bove friend and Brother, ha? Philoc. not in mine ears. Dis. What frost has ceiz'd their blood, &amp; brains, which neither Beauty nor dignity can thaw? Go travel. What stay you for? young Gentlemen sometimes Wait for a gale of gold to blow 'em out O'th'harbour; Stratocles will furnish you, And thank you more then for his forfeit life. Philoc. Stratocles can gain nothing by my abscence, While her Philargus stayes. Philarg. No, nor by mine, While Philocles remains. Dis. Shall I make a motion, Will one of you remain? Both. One must and shall. Dis. Then yield to take your lots for't. (I will make 'em) As you respect my love; your mothers life; The kingdoms good; Eudynas love and life, Let it be so. Pause not upon't, but do't. See, here's ink and paper. I am inspir'd, Apollo, with thy wisdom. Love.âand friendship. See, here's a pass for one, and a plantation He writes two lots. For tother. Love and friendship Gentlemen. Love shall abide at home, and friendship walk. According to the custom of the world. Let it be so. 'Come study not, but draw, I'le draw upon ye both else. They drew the lots. Philar. Friendship for me then. Philoc. See here I have it brother. And yours is love. My love be prosperous to you. My horse, my horse. Enter Varillus Var. All's ready, Sir. Philoc. In the first place then bring A parting cup, that by the grapes Elizar As Jove by Acheron, I may protest My constancy and zeal unto my purpose. Var. And now's my time to act thy purpose, Doris. Exit. Dis. Kick not your heels against the Gods, Philargus, It is most evidently their decree That you abide and Philocles remove. Philoc. I do obey my Lot. And noblest brother, Be you as free in love, as I from envy. Philar. But how can you forgo that equal interest You have with me in Thessaly, and Eudina? Dis. Why should that trouble you? you see he does Forgo't; and is a going. Would he were gone once. Philar. Can love allow't? Philoc. Variety of objects Like Nails abandon one another. So May I, by novelties of Travail, lose The thought of Love; and chearfully return Both hers and yours in a more just relation. Enter Varillus with a bowl of wine. Give me the bowl. Now brother to that love You owe the fair Eudina, unto which I give th'addition of mine own, and all The joyes that ere I wish'd my self and her, And to that friendship, which nor Time, nor absence Shall ever end or alter. He drinks and gives Varillus the bowl. Var. Now the service that may redeem my faults Is to be done. Philar. Give it me full, Varillus. Var. I'le give you more then you expect by this. He puts in a pouder. Philar. You have the victory in frienship, brother, Who, by your resolute absence will inforce And drive me to a happiness; wherein I must not cease, in all the strength of prayers Of sacrifice, and vowes; in all my goods Of fortune, mind and body to be yours: Which that you may return to repossess With the more speed, this health to auspicate And expedite your travails. Var. They are done Already if my Pothecaries skill fail not. Philoc. With this embrace my brother, and my last Of present ceremony, I now wish you In th'arms of your Eudinaâ And may my better part of soul, which now I leave in trust with you, by you be breath'd Into her breast; that she may lively find She has my love in yours; and that in you She has us both. Dis. So, so, enough. Ha'ye done yet? Philoc. How is it with you brother? Philarg. As it is With souls that leave the world in peace. Dis. For shame Leave womanish ceremony. Will you part Before it be too late? Philoc. Too soon I fear. Philargus! Brother! Friend! Ye Gods, how comes this? Dis. What is he dead? I see then how it comes. You or your man, or both ha'poyson'd him. Philar. No, 'twas my self. Dis. Thou wilt not go out o'th'world With a lie i'thy mouth? Speak yet again. Var. He has said well for me already, Philoc. Gone, past recovery, but he shall not pass Without my company. He offers to kill himself. Dis. snatcheth his sword away. Dis. Wilt thou die mad too? Come, Sir, let go your whiblin. He has yet Some breath. Run for PhysitiansâNo, Sir, stay. I will not quit you so. I can read guilty lines Palpably on this villans visnomy. Is there no more i'th'house? some help here! ho! Nephew forbear. As you will have me think Philocles offers again to kill himself. You guiltless of your brothers blood, forbear. How am I tortur'd! Ho! Philargus; rub him, Rub him, he may live yet. Philoc. O that the world Might be so happy! Dis. So, well said: A box Or two in kindness will not do amiss. Stir not you sirrah. O, Sir, you lay hold Enter Tersulus. On that same traytor. Var. I'le not stir my Lord. Dis. I'le hold you to your word, Sir, run, Sir, you And fetch Physitians. Ter. O my Lord, fallen dead! Dis. Stay but to look upon him, and I'le swear Thou art his murderer. Fetch the Kings Physitians, Exit Tersulus If not to cure him; yet to rip the cause Out of his sodain death. I guess they'l finde Your handy-work in's maw. Var. You heard him say It was himself that did it. I am clear'd. Enter Eupathus. Eup. My Lord, the King, impatient of your stay, Has sentâ. Dis. What has he sent. Has he sent means To call this man from death, or that from falling After him into th'grave? Eup. O heavy spectacle! Dis. But, come I will not cry tho'. Pray assist me, In with this body, Charity commands When griev'd necessity intreats your hands. Exeunt omnes. Scene 2. Geron. The four Rusticks. Ger. My Rustici amici, your Councel and Your vertue have restor'd me. And tis true As Wholom said the good Antisthenes Vertue is armour 'gainst the very fates. 1. Rus. We told you for your good, good Mr. Geron, Fond love became you not. 2. Rus. It sat upon your coat like burs or bryars Stuck in the hindlocks of our fleecy sheep; Who shake their heads; figgle, and writh their tayls, And bleat for woe; sprinkle the ground behind 'em Sometimes I wisse: Twould make one laugh and pitty 'em And all at once, but all remediless. Til we with helping wit and hands release 'em Gar. A wise man then in love is like a sheep I'th' bryars. As Whilome said 3. Rus. But (by the way) What was that Whilome, Sir, you speak much of him, But what was he pray. Ger. An ancient Britain, whom I have affected As idly as my love. But I'le forget it And use that word no more. The clowns have found me. 4. Rus. But will you now proceed upon your plot For th'honour of Tempe plains, and Tempe swains. Ger. You can all dance. 2. Rus. After our countrey guise. 3. Rus. Like so many light horses. 1. Rus. So can our wives Who have follow'd us up to Court we thank 'em Pray Juno we get them honestly home again. Ger. There is no doubt. However fear you nothing As whyâTis hard to leave off an old custom. 2. Rus. The why was out, but lome stuck in your teeth. Ger. Tis well it did so. You can dance you say. A dance I have projected for the Princess Who ever marries her it shall serve. As whyâ 1. Rus. Again? was eene a comming. Ger. You are as quick as whyâ 2. Rus. And there again. 1. Rus. Nay we are heads, I tell you Master Geron, And should have wit; and shew't we can i'th'countrey, In the head vein, though hear at Court, like courtiers We'll shew it in our heels. Pray therefore on. Ger. On, let us then to practise. King and court Shall see, to crown their joyes, some countrey sport. Exeunt omnes. Scene 3. King. Justinus. Eudina. Thymele. Attendants. King. No answer, no return? Must I intreat, Yet have my undeserved favours slighted? Thy. Yet, Sir, your Kingly patience. King. Stupid folly 'Twere longer to attend. My vow is past And register'd in heaven; the minute is At hand, that calls down thonder on me, which No tear, or prayers can mollifie or aver't, If I upon so long deliberation Shall falsifie. So, call in Stratocles. Exit Attendants. Eud. O my dread father. Yet one hours patience Till Eupathus or Disanius return. One short, short hour: I may not live so long. His wife you nam'd; though you may force me take him. King. I'le leave that to the Gods. Eud. They will forgive. Give them your imitation In mercy, as in power on earth. I know Disanius Went not in vain to call 'em to your presence. And him that he brings first into this room Of Philocles or Philargus I will take, Though he precede the other but one foot, I have it by inspiration from the Gods. King. You are full of dreams. Thym. This cannot, Sir, be long In tryal. King. Yet I am not bound to wait On those ingrateful men. O Stratocles. Enter Strato. You have from your late Errors, which your then Head-strong ambition hurried and cast you in With that humility purg'd your self, that I Conceive you now a temperate Man; and am Instructed by the clemency of the Gods To cherish and reward your vertue. Therefore From their divine appointment, as my handsâ Eud. (O mighty, SirâKing Dare not to disobey me) Receive Eudina. Str. Royal King and Master, Mistake not so the pleasure of the Gods. My forfeit life you have forgiven me: Your Kingly power and grace might do it. You Have given it freely: but I took't with caution, By future service to make good your gift: But for my forfeit love to fair Eudina, And my lost honor to the twin-born brothers, There can be no redemption, if I add By acceptation of your bounteous offer A second trespass, greater then the former. King. Do you refuse her then. Str. In hope shee'l plead My pardon to your grace. Eud. The Gods have wrought Effectually for me. King. Strangely, unexpected Are you become a suppliant Placilla? Ent. Pla. with a petition. kneels. Pla. In the behalf, Sir, of your loyal subjects, The Swains of Tempe. King. I expected, rather, News from your unkind brothers. See Justinius, The Commons, rather then I shall bestow My daughter upon Stratocles, do beseech me To take a further time. Just. Y'are happy, Sir, In his refusal and in their request. They are fair predictions of ensuing joyes. To you, your daughter, and the Kingdom, If I may be worthy to divine so much. King. How ere thy divination proves, thy wish Is worth our thanks. And we may have Enter Eupathus Glad tidings presently. Now Eupathus Where is Disanius, Philocles, and Philargus? Why come they not? Eup. They are all at hand my liege. This paper may excuse their stay. The K. reads the paper. King. O do They plead excuse then? Thym. I am full of fears. Eud. And I of sodain joy. Plac. Pray all be well. The King has struck his breast, and seems perplext. King. Justinius, Stratocles, read here this Paper. Go Eupathus, and let them enter. Stay. Yet go, bring them in their prescribed manner. I'le send the woman off, whose sodain grief May be a bar to our proceedings. Madamâ Thy. I fear that Garrula has detected me. King. I must intreat a while your absence, Lady. Thy. May I presume to ask your reason, Sir. King. My will has been above your question. Pray, Let me request you go. Thy. I know obedience. King. And go Placilla, send old Garrula to me. Thy. Now tis most evident. O mighty, Sir, Conceive not worse of me then Garrula. Let us appear together. King. What means this? Thy. You may be pleas'd to hear me first. King. Pray pull not More weight upon your breast then you can bear, By your impertinent stay. Go I command you. Thy. I must obey. However tis too late To change the resolution of my fate. Exit. Thym. Pla. King. I have not known her thus. I fear destraction Fore-runs the voice of grief, as to prevent it. Heaven knowes I call'd for Garrula, but to send her With best directions to prepare and arm Her tender soul against the sting of sorrow Before it should approach her. But Eudina You must be valliant; and not let the sight Of death in others shake your confidence. Eud. How means your majesty? King. Suppose that both Your fatal lovers, Philocles and Philargus Slept in the caves of death. Eud. I should not live then; King. Suppose his desteny had cut off one, And, in him, all the impediments, that crost You in th' enjoying of the other, say Which could you wish surviver? But you have Declar'd your constant purpose to possess The first Disanius brings into this presence. Come; one is dead. There is a strict necessity You know it. Now collect your Reason: For 'tis not Your passion for the dead; nor your dislike Of Stratocles; no though my subjects yeeld you A longer time, shall make me tempt the Gods By breaking of my vow. Be stedfast then, As you respect a father; and take courage. Recorders. Ent. Disanius before a herse. Philocles after. Varillus manacled, and led by Tersulus. Euputhus supports Philocles, as ready to sink with grief. See Philocles lives. Eud. Philargus then Is brought in dead before him by Disanius; And unto him the first to be brought in My faith was vow'd; and he is now my choice. King. What being dead? Could you affect 'em so Equally, both alive, that you forbore To chuse, because you could not have 'em both; And now seek onely him cannot be had? The herse set down, Eudina kneels to it. Philo. kneels on the other side. What Love, what madness call you this? good Gods, Throw not your wrath upon me in destruction Just. Nor let your passion Master you great, sir, As sodain grief does her. But give a little Scope to her sorrow. Shee will soon return And meet her Reason in obedience To your desires. King. I thank thee good Justinius. A Song. During which Disanius &amp;c. discourse with the King. Disanius seems to acquaint the King with the manner of Philargus death, pointing at Varillus. The King seems much troubled; but at the end of the song, (as by the Kings appointment Disanius raiseth Philocles, and Justinius raiseth Eudina, and bring them to the King while Eupathus with the Attendants go forth with the herse, the Recorders playing. which done, King. Your virgin tears and vowes ore your lost love I did attend with pardon, my Eudina, In hope you are now compliant to my will. Dis. Grieve not your father Madam. Eud. I ha'done; And as the Gods direct him to command me, I must and will obey. Dis. So that's well said. King. The Gods have pleas'd Eudina to determine Your doubtful choice, reserving Philocles Unto your love without competitor: Therefore it now remains that he be taken Into your liking; whom I have decreed My successor. Eud. His merits are above Me and this land; In which what interest My birth hath given me I resign to him. Onely let me beseech a further respite. King. For what? the celebration? I consent; But for the contract, this imediate hour Shall see it knit beyond all dissolution. Dis. I that I thirst to see. King. Give me your hands. Eudina gives her hand. Yours Philocles. Dis. Why give you not your hand, Dare you not trust the King with't? should he now Shew a jades trick and flie back. Philoc. I beseech Under your highness Pardon, yet, a respite. Dis. More respits yet? Was ever hopeful match Driven so round about? King. Why this delay? Philoc. My brothers blood cries in me for your justice Which must be executed on his murderer Before I safely can, or dare possess His interest in the faith of fair Eudina. Dis. O, is that all? that may be soon dispatch'd. Come forwards Poysoner. Good your Majesty, For expedition, make me his judge, And hangman too (I care not) rather then Suffer this match hang o'the tenters thus. King. Has he confes'd the fact? Dis. Yes, yes to me. I beat it out of him. Quickly good King. King. Your patience good Disanius Sirrah speak. Var. It was my act. But may your mercy look Upon my love in it unto my Lord. King. Your Lord shall be your judge then. Philoc. I adjudge him To sharp but lingring tortures (for his death Alone can yeeld no satisfaction) Tortures that may draw in, by his confession, As accessaries with him, all the homicides That are i'th' Kingdom. Dis. A hard matter that. Philoc. Nor can I think his onely brain and hands Compos'd the poyson. Dis. Hang him, hee's a Barber, And uses Aqua fortis, oyl of Vitriol, Mercury, and such like, to cleanse his Rasors. Just. 'Tis good that you Varillus clear your conscience And, if you had confederates in the fact, Give up their names. Ter. Varillus, I suspect Doris joyn'd hand with you in my Lords death. Dis. What's that you mutter? Ter. It shall out my Lord; The handmaid Doris put him on't; I know't By what she said to us both we being her lovers. Dis. The Taylor proves an honest man: because He cannot have the wench himself, he'll hang her. Var. Of her I had the poyson, tis confest. Exit Tersulus Dis. O that whore. King. Find her and drag her hither. Enter Thymele. Thy. Where's my Philargus? Give me yet his body, That with a mothers tears I may imbalm it. Dis. You have heard the woful newes then; but my sister Could grief recal Philargus, we would weep A second deluge for his reparation; Renew his breath by sighing, and awake him, With grones out of his Sepulchre. Thy. Already Have you inter'd him then? you made strange hast. Was it your subtlety to send me hence, Fearing my cries might have reviv'd him, king? And so again delay'd your daughters marriage? I have enough to cross it yet Philargus Dis. What's that? Str. Destraction sure. King. My fear foresaw't. Thy. You are deceiv'd, for from my depth of sorrow, Through this thick film of tears, I can perceive You are about to joyn the hands and faiths Of Philocles and Eudina, King. Is not that Enough to dry your tears, and shew, you that The Gods were rather merciful in leaving This son, then rigorous in taking tother? Dis. Or would you now, cause you have lost Philargus, Kill Philocles too by crossing of this contract? Thy. It is the pleasure of the Gods I cross it. Ent. Gar. Dis. Of devils it is. What can she mean? Go sleep. Gar. King by your leave. Dis. What sayes old suck bottle now? Thy. Nay I am here before you Garrula, And now will tell the long hid secret for you. And if I erre in it, disprove me. Gar. Tell't then. My faltring tongue will fail me. I can hear tho'. Drinks Thy. This contract must not be. King. You then must yeeld More reason then I find you have. Thy. Your self Can never make it. You will sooner joyn The Wolfe and Lamb. Falcon and Dove together. King. No trifling I command you Thymele. Philoc. If you be serious, Mother, hold us not In this suspence. Thy. Let not the royal blood Of Thessaly be stain'd with an incestuous match. King. How! Gar. She sayes right. They are both your lawful children By your own vertuous Queen now inâElisium. King. What dreams are these of your distemperd heads, Thy. This is no dream or fable. But unfain'd Sip. As truth it self: Which with your gracious leave I shall demonstrate, humbly craving pardon For my so long concealment, as I'le yeeld Due reason for it. King. Freely speak, you have it. Thy. You may remember in your civil wars, (Those cruel warres, as I may justly stile 'em) In which my husband fellâ Dis. O my brave brother! Thy. When open Rebels and domestick Traytors Pursu'd your Crown and life; your gracious Queen To have been brought to bed; and was beleev'd To have miscarried by an abortive birth. King. True: In her flight she was constrain'd to take A neighbouring cottage; and use the help Of the Swains wife. Gar. That swain-ess was my self, Though my deserts have glorified me since: And by my help (and somewhat of the Gods) She then made you the Father of that Prince. Dis. Take up thy bottleâSister, speak you on. Thy. Th'affrighted queen (yet wise in that extremity) Suspecting that the innocence of her babe Born to a Kingdom, could not be secur'd In those combustions from apparent danger, Sent him to me in private, then in travel Of my PhilargusâCharging me to fain A second labour, with the Midwifes aid, For Philocles: I did, and was reputed Mother of both. King. I cannot think our Queen Would keep us ignorant of so good a Fortune. Thy. I mov'd her oft to tell you. But she answer'd, All is not sound, There's danger, yet; And when After Eudyna's birth she felt her self At point of death, she strictly did enjoyn Me and this woman, onely conscious with her, By oath of which she had prepar'd this copy A paper. In her own hand, to keep it silent, till Philocles should be able to secure Himself from treachery; or that your terme Of life expiring, or some accident Of no lesse consequence requir'd detection. For further proofâ Kin. My joy forbids more questioning Give me my flesh and blood into my bosome. Thrice happy Fathers if your Children were Borne to you thus of perfect Age. But where Is now a Match for my Eudina. I Have here a successor. A shout within and crying Philargus, Philargus. &amp;c. King. Hah! Voyces i'th Ayre that cry Philargus? Eud. Voyces that do tell me, I must follow him Up to the heavens, and there be married to him. Des. Here's the She-Devil now. Ent. Turs. with Dor. Dor. You need not pull me For that mans love, I laid thy Lord to sleep: Had I lov'd thee best, then his Lord had slept. Dis. How does he sleep? speak impudent baggage, how? Dor. How? With a powder, Sir, which my own father A skilful pothecary prepar'd; who, if Philargus dye, shall hang with us for Company. Dis. Your father? Dor. Yes, But now the perils past. See, if he sleep, tis walking. Enter Philargus Eupathus. Philoc. Ha! Philargus. Or but the shade; the spirit of my friend. Philar. Be not amaz'd, as at an apparition. Thy. Doth my son live? O then I have enough. Dis. Come hither, come hither you three. I will discharge The scene of you. Thy love unto thy Lord (Though somewhat unadvisedly imploy'd) Deserves reward; Ile see it given thee, Thy Lord and King shall thank thee: take thy wench, She has love in her wit, and wit in her anger. I like the luck of things; that ill intents Should bring forth good events. Thy faithfulness To thy Lord too was happy. Go, I'le see you Ext. Var. Ter. Dor. Ent. Ger. All royally rewarded. How now Geron? Ger. My Lord I see here's joy towards, as whyâ Dis. 'Slife, stand not Whiloming now man: but be brief. Ger. Cry mercy. I had left it. But my Lord To celebrate the flowing joyes in Court, I and my Countrey heads have fram'd a Masque, Rather an antick dance, rather a countrey toy, Rather a Rustick round; rather aâ Dis. Hoy day! Thy Rather's worse then thy Whilom. Dost know What time o'day 'tis. Ger. Tis a rural thing To be presented at the Princess wedding And, if you think it meet, I will induce The practise of it presently. As whyâ Dis. Go fetch the heads and heels, I'le stay the King, To see and laugh at 'em. That's grace enough. Exit Geron. King. Philargus you have much to know; the which We will Eudina tell you, now shee's yours. Receive her and our blessing. Philar. Were I dead (As I was thought to be) your name pronounc'd Over my grave, beyond all Necromancy, Would call fresh blood into my veins again; Strengthen my nerves, to break the Iron gates Of death; and force my joyful spirit from Th' Elisian Paradise to live with you. King. You shall not be a looser Thymele: Philocles shall be yours, and in exchange Placilla mine. Philoc. To me my beauteous spouse Thou art as Juno to her Jupiter, Sister and wife. Thy. Your highness may be pleas'd Now at so happy leasure to perpend The Oracle; which truly hath effected Each word of the prediction. King. Who can repeat the answer, I ha'lost it. Dis. I have it. Contend not for the jewel, which Ere long shall both of you inrich. Philoc. Eudina does so: me in a dear sister. Philar. Me in a Peerless wife. Dis. Pursue your fortune: for 'tis she Shall make ye what you seem to be. Philoc. She has done that too: For now indeed w'are brothers King. Apollo thou hast fill'd us all with joy, Loud Musick is here. But has our joy already fill'd our Court With Musick? Dis. Will your Majesty yet sit And see the practise of a presentation, Against the Marriages by your Swains of Tempe With thanks; and give it all the grace we may? Enter Geron and the Swains and Nymphs for the dance. Ger. From Tempe plains, the Tempe Swains With mirth and Melody, With Dance and Song do hither throng To greet your Majestie. Gar. O there, look there, Madam my Son, and all My old Temperian Neighbours. Ger. We cannot hope in all our scope, To gain much praise for skill, But it shall be enough, if ye Accept of our good will. The Dance. King. My thanks to all. All. Heaven bless your Majesty. Exeunt. King. Thanks to Apollo. Let his temple be The place of our solemnity. His Altars Let them be laden with Arabian spices; Let his Priests lead, in a devout procession, The horned Sacrifice, mantled with Ghirlonds And we (our Temples crown'd with Laurel) follow With Musick, sounding Hymen and Apollo.
