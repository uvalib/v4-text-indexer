      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. —A desolate wilderness amid mountains overhung with gloomy woods. ARIEL: Ye elfine race! come forth—tis Ariel calls. Come from yon crags, dank caves, and cheerless woods. Not such your haunts ere jealous discord shook The fairy throne—Ah! from that ill-starr'd hour, Titania, my sweet mistress, and her Lord Imperial Oberon, have never met, Save, yearly, on this day, (so fate permits,) To mourn their doom—Come forth! tis Ariel calls. (Four groups of Fairies advance slowly to melancholy music. Ah hapless exiles! grief has strangely dimm'd Your roseate hue—in what ungenial haunt, Your destin'd prison, while the year toil'd round, Has echo murmur'd to your plaint of woe? 1st. FAIRY. Thro' time untold where lurk'd the toad Clos'd in the cold rock's central womb, I drove him from his lone abode, And there I pin'd in sunless gloom, Doom'd o'er the dreams of bliss to weep, When cradling lilies rock'd my sleep. 2nd FAIRY. I crept beneath the thorny shade Where snakes had cast their coily sloughs, There, forc'd by fate, I wreath'd my braid With berries pluck'd from night-shade boughs: And as the rude weed swell'd my hand, I sigh'd for flow'rs of fairy land— 3rd FAIRY. From yon scath'd oak, at twilight grey, When the horn'd owlet left her young, I scar'd her moon-ey'd brood away, As on their nest my limbs I flung: And there I thought on fairy bow'rs, And saddened o'er remembered hours. 4th FAIRY. Where mortal thing might never breathe, While loitering ice-drops, one by one, Burst on the fretted flints beneath, And turn'd each earthly form to stone, I wept for fairy fountains clear, And told each ice-drop with a tear. CHORUS. Now, foreboding woe to come, Spirit, we dread to hear our doom— 1st FAIRY. Ah when shall we revisit fairy land, And those its pleasant seats, by brook, and fount, Groves that wept balsam, and th'unfading bow'rs Of laurel, lightning proof?— ARIEL. Ah! luckless Fays! Here, in dire exile, with your Lords, oath-bound, Long must ye droop in these ungenial shades Where Oberon mourns, begirt with harts and hinds, Foxes, and loathsome things, and beasts of the wild. Forms human once, but by his touch transformed To brutal. Such their nature, that forswore Vows heard by heav'n, of love and wedded faith. Thus they in shape of beast their penance work, And bound with us, here wait alike their doom, On man's frail race dependant— FAIRY. Gentle Ariel! Is there no hope? ARIEL. None, till love crown a pair Such as time ne'er has seen, this side the moon— FAIRY. How gifted? ARIEL. With pure faith that knows not change; With constancy defying every proof, Torture, and imminent death, and syren smiles Of amorous blandishment. This wondrous pair, Earth-born, alone can loose the solemn vow That Oberon breath'd: no more, (till such be found) To sport in fairy land, or on his throne Replace his banish'd bride. (Sylpha descends disguised like an African boy, bearing a magic mirror. lo! Sylpha speeds Before the wind. Say, Spirit, has success Smil'd on thy service? SYLPHA. Such as o'erpast hope— Take back th'enchanted mirror, precious proof Of Oberon's trust in me— ARIEL. Relate what past, That I, erewhile, may sooth the fairy king, With gleam of dawning bliss— SYLPHA. I, as enjoyn'd, In likeness of a slave of Afric's soil, Went, where enthron'd mid Peers and Paladins, Sat Charlemaine in proud imperial state. It was a solemn feast-day, ushered in With splendid pomp of tilt and tournament. Young Huon's maiden lance had all unhors'd; And his the envy'd prize: a scarf gold-purfled Wrought by a royal virgin. At my entrance The heralds' trumpets preluded the banquet— I sounded my wreath'd conch, and all was still. The knights around me throng'd—“behold” (I said) “Brave Paladins! a maid, whose peerless charms “Shall fire the pride and flower of Chivalry “To deeds that trance the hearer”—at the word I held the mirror up. There Rezia smil'd Sweet as the moon that o'er the summer lake Hangs gazing on her image— ARIEL. how look'd Huon? SYLPHA. Like one, whose every sense dissolved in bliss, First thrills with love's delicious witchery— ARIEL. 'Twas bravely done, sweet spirit— SYLPHA. “lo! (I said) “The wonder of the east, proud Bagdad's heiress; “Win, wed her, rescued from Horasbec's arms, “The hateful Tartar king, her plighted Lord— Swift at the mention of the Tartar king Who slew young Huon's sire, “be mine (he cried) “The perilous adventure”—on I steer'd His course to Palestine: and lonely left him A wearied stranger, near the woodman's cave— SONG. While the charm'd Steersman idly stood, All day before the prow I flew; I beckon'd to the following flood, And to my nod the vessel drew. At dead of night when died the wind And loosely flap'd the loitering sail, I spread my viewless plumes behind, And as I wav'd them, woke the gale. And still I tun'd my melody: While floating dolphins gambold round, And sea-maids leap'd to catch the sound That hush'd the storm with lullaby— ARIEL. Spirit! time speeds his flight, and ere again The slope sun sinks his car in floods of gold, The Tartar's nuptial kiss, if Huon fail, Seals Rezia's death—haste to the woodman's cave. By magic sights, and songs whose potency Draws down the listning planets from their spheres, Charm Huon forth—on him our doom depends. SYLPHA. 'Tis done—I vanish from thy sight On pinion that outstrips the light—(Flies away.) ARIEL (to the other Fairies.) Ye! when the star of eve peers o'er yon cliff, Here greet your sov'reigns—hence—away—away (Exeunt Fairies. SCENE changes to another part of the forest—on one side, amid the rocks, a cave illumined by a sparkling fire— Huon enters during a violent storm— HUON. 'Tis pathless all—no trace of human foot. Sure here at noon-day, mid such solitudes The hoary woodman, tenant of the soil, Trusts not his step. Ill shall it fare with me An unknown wanderer mid these stranger wilds— Thick drives the pitiless storm. Beneath this rock, O'er which the Cedar spreads his branching arms Boldly luxuriant, will I rest awhile Till the dark clouds sweep by—ha! from yon cave A light bursts forth with hospitable blaze— This way it guides my step (goes to the cave) —the up-pil'd heap Burns cheerful, and the fire brisk-crackling, fann'd By the keen gale, strikes jocund on the ear. Methought I heard a voice EUSTACE (behind the scenes.) Halt! HUON. Ha! what voice Thunders thus fiercely? EUSTACE (entering.) Halt! HUON. Say, who art thou, Of savage semblance, mask'd in garb uncouth? Thy rude exterior, whosoe'er thou art, Marks thee no sojourner in haunts of men. And if thy manners answer to thy garb, Rude shall my welcome prove. EUSTACE. Oh native speech! Sweet melody! for many a year unheard! Oh let me hear once more the enchanting sound That vibrates on my soul! HUON. Speak; who art thou, That 'mid these rocks— EUSTACE. Sir, welcome to my cell! Suspect me not: again I bid you welcome.— Knight! follow me. HUON. Thy speech and garb agree not; Thus rude, yet strangely courteous! EUSTACE. Trust me, sir, This beard, that darkly bristles on my breast, These skins of mountain beasts, thus coarsely patch'd, That flap on my bare shanks, may hide a heart Kind as the worshipper of courts, who glitters In fashion's bravery—leave this outward cave— The storm that bows the forest with its blast, Rings thro' the crags, and from yon untrimm'd shoots That dangle o'er the yawning arch above, Thick drops the rain. HUON, Say, whither would'st thou lead me EUSTACE. Here, to my inner cave—these unknown rocks, Gigantic columns rear'd by Nature's hand, Lead to my palace. These pil'd trunks that blaze Before its entrance, are the centinels That from my haunt drive back the prowling beasts: Whose nightly howl, familiar to these deserts, Preludes my sleep. My garb I grant is rough; Yet, Knight, suspect me not—lo! at your feet I lay my knotted mace. Now, follow me, And fear not. HUON. Fear! thou art a man—I fear not. Take up thy club, and lead me where thou wilt. (SCENE changes to the inner cave. EUSTACE. How like you, Sir, my palace, far more priz'd By me than golden roofs. Here Peace resides. All that I have is yours. Feed on this honey Hiv'd by the mountain swarms in hollow oaks. I know their summer flights in flowery glades, Aye, and their wintery stations. Take these figs, And these ripe dates—nay, freely take, my palm trees Would never fail me, tho' a host of strangers O'erflow'd my cave. HUON. Kind host! these savage fruits Have exquisite flavor. EUSTACE. Cull my choicest grapes: These, freshly pluck'd, these raisins dry'd in the sun; Such vines, if by our Gascon peasants train'd, And duly trodden out in jocund season, Would gush with liquor that might rouse a dance To fancy'd minstrels—all I have is yours, Nor ask I in return ought but the sound Of my lov'd native land. HUON. Yet more, my thanks: And, if this gold— EUSTACE. Mines would not purchase you The flint beneath your foot. Now lay you down Before my hearth. Fir, larch, and unctuous pine Gay-sparkling, breathe around delicious odors— Smooth is this couch of reeds, with moss o'erstrown: The wild flow'r, and crush'd thyme beneath you spread, Shall pillow you on perfume. HUON. Courteous host, My limbs require repose— EUSTACE. Yet, let me first Unyoke this pond'rous harness from your back. Tho' long unus'd, yet still I know to handle These war accoutrements. So we unlink These iron joints. There hang your breast-plate, here Your greaves and shield. By heav'n! I little thought That the old office thus had warm'd my blood: But as I loos'd the braces of your helm, The sound of the steel clasp, and plated thong Rung a shrill note that rous'd a warrior's ear— HUON. A warrior's! (Huon takes off his helmet.) EUSTACE. Heav'n! how like! yes, limb for limb. Eye, forehead, mouth, and hair. HUON. Like whom? EUSTACE. Oh pardon! A dream of better days, most sweet yet painful, Forces these gushing tears. Say? what your name? HUON. Huon, the son of Seg?in, Duke of Guyenne. EUSTACE. My heart deceived me not. Oh welcome, welcome; Son of my honor'd Lord—Youth, oft these hands Have dandled you in childhood: I have humm'd Old Gascon carols to your cradled sleep. Forgive my freedom, Sir, joy must have vent: And joy and I, aye, since my master perish'd, Have still been strangers. Deign to look on Eustace. HUON. My father's trusty Squire! EUSTACE. I shar'd his woe, When in lone pilgrimage on Syria's soil Wild Arabs seiz'd us: I rush'd in to save him, When, while the Christian Knight refus'd to bend His knee at Mahmoud's name, Horasbec's dagger Smote him unarm'd. Me back the Tartar sent To spread the tale, and his defiance bear To threaten'd Christendom. Since then, self-bound In voluntary penance, mid these rocks My lonely life has past. Adventurous youth! What urg'd you to these wilds? HUON. I haste to Bagdad, Avenger of my sire, to dare Horasbec To mortal fight; and rescue from his arms The Sultan's beauteous daughter. Guide my steps. Huon is not ungrateful. But, my friend, If age has ic'd the current of your blood, Reckless I go. EUSTACE. You call me from the grave. You fill me with new life. No other guide But Eustace shall attend on Seg?in's son. With you I live or die. (soft music heard.) HUON. Heard you the strain That swells and dies away at intervals? Methinks aerial minstrels wake the lute With fairy touch, attun'd to sweeter sounds Than Zephyr whispers o'er the vernal reeds. SONG by an invisible Fairy—during the Song aerial figures of Huon and Rezia are seen. The Princess supplicating his aid. Knight! by Regia's magic glance That steeps each sense in amorous trance, Come to my call, make no delay. To Bagdad speed thy destin'd way— Hark! while I weave thy victor braid, A father's spirit—“Vengeance,” cries, And love, that form'd th'enchanting maid, Soft-whispers, “win the peerless prize!” Led on by Glory, Vengeance, Love, Dauntless the dread adventure prove— Haste, Huon, haste! make no delay. Come forth! I fly before thy way— (at the conclusion of the Song the magic visions vanish.) HUON. Spirit of air! lead on—be thou my guide! Tho' death with lifted dart before me stood, Huon would dauntless follow. lo! I come. (Exeunt. End of ACT 1st.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Almanzor's Palace at Bagdad. Almanzor—Almanzaris. ALMANZARIS. Not mine alone the wish. This day, Horasbec Calls you to join the chase. All Bagdad throngs To view the passing show. ALMANZOR. These pomps of peace Suit not a warrior's spirit. ALMANZARIS. Why Almanzor That frown of discontent, when fortune seems To wait on every wish? ALMANZOR. Ah what avails This arm resistless, what my charmed life That mocks the force of weapons forg'd by man, Since, by dire vows compell'd, my conquest crowns Horasbec's triumph? Ah! might Rezia chuse A warrior worthy of her charms, Almanzor Had never brooded o'er successless love, Nor curst malignant fate. (Horasbec enters.) ALMANZARIS. Horasbec comes. HORASBEC. Almanzor, haste! fair Rezia joins the chase. Ne'er have her charms adorn'd the festive train That sought her smile. But on this blissful day Fore-runner of our nuptials, Rezia's self Bright as the sun that glads the expecting world, Comes forth to grace the sports. Almanzor, haste! The pomp but waits your presence— ALMANZOR. Yes—Almanzor Once more will swell thy triumph—Come, fair sister! (Exeunt omnes. SCENE changes to Rezia's apartment. Salma—Mirza. SALMA. A dream so work her fancy! nay, you dream— MIRZA. Night after night the visionary form Smiles on her sleep. SALMA. It passes all belief— MIRZA. And yet sweet Rezia dotes upon the shade. What but the hope to meet th'expected knight Now leads her to the chase? else, never Rezia Had grac'd Horasbec's pomp. SALMA. Oh hapless maid MIRZA. Go then, dear mother, on this festive day, Strangers, nay Christians, all unquestion'd flock To joyful Bagdad. On the bridge, where Tygrit Flows by your cottage-garden, take your stand: And, if a knight, such as the vision pictur'd, Draw near, beneath your roof with kindly greeting Welcome the stranger—hence—(Salma departs)—the Princess comes. (Rezia enters with a numerous train magnificently attired for the chase. MIRZA. Sweet Mistress! REZIA (to her train.) Stand apart—speak faithful Mirza! Relieve my throbbing heart. MIRZA. Ah! how shall Mirza Give answer? REZIA. Has no stranger Knight appear'd? MIRZA. Still have I watch'd in vain—my stand o'erlook'd The passing croud—alas! no stranger knight There met my view. REZIA. Yet, yet his arm shall save me— Love! if delusive phantoms round me play, Still as thy magic day-dreams dye away, In visions of the night their trace restore! Ah! in that dream may death my eyelids close! So shall a smile on my pale lip repose, And my sooth'd spirit rest, where peace dwells ever more. (Exeunt Rezia and her train. SCENE changes to a wild Desart near the enchanted Wood. Huon and Eustace. HUON. I tell thee Eustace 'twas no faithless vision— Here, what I feel is truth—if false that shape, Life is itself a shadow— EUSTACE. Sir, the form Was exquisitely touched—yet after all Perchance, mere fancy's work—the o'er-heated brain Has wond'rous faculties to shape at will Its own creation—in my rocky cave, When o'er the dying embers I have mus'd On battles of my youth, scenes long time past, Yet livelier far than memory e'er pourtray'd, Glow'd in my vision—these old scars have bled Fresh as when first the crooked scymitar Sever'd my helm; and my lone couch has rung To many a midnight larum—yet—my lord! By heav'n! he hears me not— HUON. That smile again! Oh let my lip once more awake the blush That glow'd beneath my kiss! Oh once again Imbibe the balmy breath whose fragrance pour'd The sweets of paradise!— EUSTACE. His hue is chang'd— I like it not— HUON. They shall not force thee from me— My limbs are planet-struck. EUSTACE. Rouse, rouse you, Sir; Some hag more horrid than the night-mare, rides On your day-visions—I have groan'd beneath The lumpish burthen—I have seen the fiend With her squab brood of goblins and squint demons, At midnight, when late feasts like lead opprest me: But in the sun-shine, never—rouse, Sir Knight! Haste, haste to Bagdad—there the beauteous maid Claims her deliverer— HUON. There these arms shall clasp her. When, when shall we arrive? EUSTACE. If fortune smile, And the fierce Arab hordes cross not our course, Ere twice the day-light dies, you reach the goal— But, Sir, there is a path amid the wood, Fenc'd by yon firs, that in two hours, 'tis said, Leads straight to Bagdad— HUON. That way Huon hastes— Lead on— EUSTACE. Not threats, nor bribes shall e'er induce me— 'Tis haunted, Sir— HUON. Nay—never fear. EUSTACE. Not fear! 'Tis haunted, Sir, I say— HUON. I say, lead on— EUSTACE. Yes, you may smile, fair youth, but once entangled You'll never hear the sound of mirth again. Thousands have enter'd—none have e'er returned— A little further this way, and I'll whisper Strange secrets in your ear—a tiny demon, None of your common ghosts that stalk by night, And vanish at the dawn, there holds his court— A little further this way—do not smile— 'Tis a malicious spirit, who in sport, Turns with a touch these dainty forms of ours, To shape of beasts—heard you yon hideous roar? Fly, fly the place— HUON. Talk not of goblins, Eustace, And fears of visionary phantoms born. I haste to Bagdad— EUSTACE. Here! behold your guide. I dread not flesh and blood—but Sir, I own, This fiend unmans me—sword and shield avail not 'Gainst a malicious foe, that show'rs at will Invisible blows— HUON. Peace—I will hear no more— The way that leads to Bagdad, Huon hastes— Thou to thy cave—farewell. EUSTACE. Not that—not that— Come fiend, come goblin, while my blood is warm, Old Eustace never will desert his Lord— (Exeunt. Ariel and Fairies enter. ARIEL sings. Where maze in maze meand'ring round The leafy labyrinth shades the ground, Haste, and as the wanderers stray, Lure to yon central spot their way. Thou, like the fire that nightly flies, When o'er the marsh blue mists arise, On wings of gleaming vapour ride, Before them flash, and onward glide. Thou, earth-fixt on the hillock damp Trim with green flame the glow-worm lamp, That spots with light the gloomy shade, And beams an emerald on the glade. Thou, like the watch-tow'r's distant light That stars the promontory's height, And streaming o'er the darksome tides, The storm-tost wreck to anchor guides, Flame o'er yon pine that tops the grove, And blaze a beacon from above. (Fairies exeunt. SCENE changes to a different part of the forest. Huon and Eustace enter. HUON. 'Tis vanish'd—yet methought a beck'ning flame Still danc'd before me—if these shades be haunted, Here dwells the enchanter, in this central spot, Where the wild mazes meet— EUSTACE. Not that way, Sir, Not for the world—your floating locks of gold Will grieve, when chang'd to bristly hairs, they shag Some antler'd brow—I speak not of my beauty; Yet I had rather lay me in the grave Such as my mother bore me, than go down Deck'd with a cloven hoof. (Music is heard, and the scenes described in Huon's speech are gradually displayed.) What heav'nly strains Draw my charm'd spirit—lo! soft gleams of light Illume the grove, and pour their roseate tints, Like clouds, that purpling o'er the summer sky, Play in the setting sun-beams—light before me, A castle floats in air; where, as inlaid By cunning skill of fairy architect, Gems, brilliant as heavn's bow, with changeful hues Flame on the battlements. (The portals of the castle open, and Oberon, like a beautiful boy, with a lily wand in his hand, advances in a car drawn by lions.) EUSTACE. 'Tis he!—the demon— Fly, fly, my lord— HUON. Behold the God of love! EUSTACE. 'Tis the deceitful fiend— OBERON. Stay, Huon, stay. Thy happiness thou fliest— HUON. How sweet his voice! EUSTACE. More fell than thunder when it rives a rock— Youth! I will force you from the spot. OBERON. Oh! stay— HUON. Loose me—if fiends have shap'd that beauteous form, I will not fly—unhand me— OBERON. Rash old man! Yet not the sunshine purer than thy soul— Or thou had'st felt my vengeance—with soft breath Thus I chastise thy folly. (Oberon gently blows his horn, and Eustace swoons at his feet. Why thus mute Huon of Bourdeaux? speak, and dread me not— HUON. Why should I fear? who art thou? speak thy will— OBERON. I am the monarch of the Fairy realm— Huon of Bourdeaux hear!—I long have lov'd thee, Not like weak mortals with capricious fondness, As fancy wavers, but that in thy soul I trac'd each kindly seed of opening virtue. Manhood matures the fruit, that in thy spring Bloom'd with delightful promise. I will aid thee. HUON. Hail! Fairy Monarch! OBERON. Interrupt me not. Bow down—around thy neck I chain this horn: How seeming worthless! yet the globe itself Chang'd to a diamond sphere, would fail to purchase This matchless gift. Soft wind along its folds Low melodies, then breathless at thy feet, Fierce kings, and hosts in arms that sought thy life, Shall swoon in death-like trance—if loudly rung, At once I stand before thee, tho' the earth Roll'd its vast orb between us—yet—beware— Nor waste on worthless cause that solemn call— That solemn call once heard, the o'erstrain'd bugle Flies back to fairy land— EUSTACE (slowly recovering) Aye, aye—I said it— 'Tis the sly demon—you'll ne'er smile again— My brain swims, and the forest dances round. OBERON —to Eustace, presenting to him a golden goblet, filled with wine. Take this o'erflowing bowl—its potent juice Shall renovate thy frame—and swell each vein With youth's gay dancing blood— HUON —to Eustace. Nay, fear not, Eustace! EUSTACE. Look, Sir, 'tis colour'd with the Gascon grape, Red as a ruby—o'er the brim it bubbles—(he drinks.) How! it o'erflows again: full as at first— I left no drop: but as I drain'd the bowl I saw these eyes reflected in its hollow Beam in bright gold—(to Oberon)—low at thy feet I kneel, God of the golden bowl. OBERON. Huon, receive it. The gold by fairy graver quaintly chas'd, Makes not its value: nor the wine that pour'd Thro' aged veins the jocund blood of youth: But its instinctive quality that proves The nature of the heart—if pure the lip That tastes the bowl, the liquor self-supply'd, Streams without fail: if base, th'indignant bubbles Sink self-absorb'd, and the void goblet turn'd To fiery metal, brands the man of guilt. Take it—and now farewell! to Bagdad haste— There at the nuptial feast claim thou the bride. Till then, in fearless trust repose on me. Behold thy path— HUON. Oh how shall Huon mark His boundless gratitude? OBERON. By faith, by virtue— Be but the current of thy future life Pure as its source, my favour is repay'd A thousand fold—remember, man is frail, Nor spurn the counsel of thy fairy friend— Oh think there are in nature secret tyes By man unseen, that in the chain of being Ascending and descending, link by link, Join creatures seeming opposite; farewell— Huon, perhaps the bliss of Oberon Depends on thee—be virtuous and succeed— (Oberon ascends his Car, and departs—the enchanted Castle vanishes. (A loud roar, and shriek are heard.) EUSTACE. Hark—'tis the lion's roar— HUON. I hear a shriek Of thrilling agony—some hapless wanderer Seiz'd by the prowling beasts that haunt these woods Claims our assistance—follow me— EUSTACE. Lead on. Exeunt. HORASBEC —(behind the scenes.) Help, or I'm dead— EUSTACE —(behind the scenes.) Strike him once more, my lord. Back—or the beast will crush you in his fall. (They enter supporting Horasbec.) HUON —(to Horasbec.) Lean on us, Sir,—nay quicken not your pace. The lion is no more. EUSTACE. Here, gently seat him On this soft mound of moss—nay, fear not, Sir, Your steed half-eaten welters in his blood: He will not race again; but you breathe well: And, but in apprehension, free from wound— (To Huon)—When the fierce lion darting on your blade, Yawn'd o'er you with his wide sepulchral jaws, I little thought that my old cedar bough, Tho' well I knew its worth, had at one swing, Crack'd his rock scull— HUON. Behold, the mantling colour Relumes his cheek— EUSTACE. Let us complete the cure— Give him the bowl—there's virtue in each drop—(To Horasbec.) Sir, were you crookt, on crutches, sip this juice, You'd fling your props away, and bound in air, As when your mistress beckon'd to the ball In life's brisk dancing prime. HORASBEC —(throwing the bowl away.) Thou fiend of hell! It burns like glowing metal—curses on it— EUSTACE. Guilt, by this light— HORASBEC —(aside) How can I scape these sorcerers? HUON —(advancing solemnly towards him) Pagan! behold this sword I lift to heaven— 'Twas not my arm: no, 'twas the Christian God That sav'd thy life—touch this—(his sword)—and hail his name. HORASBEC —(suddenly springing up, and running away.) Curse on thy faith and thee, thou Christian dog! HUON. Blasphemer! fly my vengeance— EUSTACE. Heed him not. Most nimbly, ostrich like, he sweeps the plain— 'Tis vain to follow him—look, in his flight The wretch has dropp'd his turban, starr'd with gems. A man of note indeed, but base of heart— I will not touch them— HUON. Eustace, let us forth— That prospect fires my soul—along yon champaign That like a sea of verdure spreads before us, Swift Tygris, and Euphrates mix their streams— And thickly girt with tow'r and battlement, Tall palaces, and swelling cupolas, Minarets and mosques, that catch the sun's low beams, Imperial Bagdad beckons me—come forth— Success or death there ends my bold emprize. (Exeunt. SCENE changes to Oberon's Haunt in the enchanted Forest. Ariel and Fairies enter. ARIEL. Haste, Spirits! haste! o'er yonder snow-wreath'd cliff, Lo! Hesper clearly shines. Yet ah! the moon Once the bright regent of our revelries, Veils her fair orb, as if the pensive planet Were darken'd by our grief. 'Tis now the time— Mark'd you the warning meteor? Fays! they come— Bow down—ere yon wing'd cars, that waft our lords, (Oberon, Titania, from opposite quarters, meet in their aerial cars.) Borne on the viewless winds, from climes oppos'd, Meet in mid air, low breathe in plaintive tune Soft sounds, if plaintive tune may sooth their woe. FAIRIES. If ever sooth'd by melody, Attemper'd to the touch of fairy lute, The voice of woe was mute, Sweet Echo! join our minstrelsy! And ere the dying cadence close, Oh charm the troubled spirit to repose! OBERON. Titania! once again, in these sad haunts, On this ill-omend day— TITANIA. Oh pardon me! That thus I interrupt thee—do not breathe Words of harsh import—as I floated by, Each magic note of elfine melody Once heard delightful, seem'd alas! to pour Reproaches on me. ARIEL. Say not so, sweet mistress! TITANIA. Oh Oberon! if penitence can move; If to have liv'd in exile, far from thee, In climes, where each dull season wears alike The winter's hue; if still, where e'er I pin'd In restless solitude, around me hovered The spirit of departed joy—if these Can move thee; while I bathe thy feet in tears, Thou wilt not turn relentless. OBERON. Rise, Titania! Thou hast not wept unpity'd—ah! might tears Streaming in sympathy with thine, efface Oaths register'd in heav'n, thou ne'er hadst sought Forgiveness at my feet, nor I had mourn'd My ineffectual pow'r. Yet rise, despair not— If faith a dwelling hold in youthful hearts, Untainted with the commerce of the world, Once more we may be blest— TITANIA. What hope? say— OBERON. Ariel. Hold up that magic mirror—lo! that form— 'Tis Rezia, Bagdad's heiress—look again— 'Tis Huon, Duke of Guyenne—a peerless pair. These, by my potent art, in dreams of bliss Each to the other bound, alone can loose The oath I rashly swore. TITANIA. A ray of hope Darts thro' my grief—give me the maid in charge. With every hair that waves on Huon's head, The God of Love shall link a golden chain That fetters heart to heart. OBERON. Vain here thy pow'r. Oh leave her to the fascinating dream. Nature, more strong than magic, fans the flame, When love first wakes to bliss a virgin heart. Huon is virtuous—but I fear— TITANIA. Oh speak! Why that portentous silence? OBERON. Man is frail: These are of earth. Our pow'rs are limited: We cannot change the heart; there man alone Is in himself supreme. At will we lavish Crowns, riches, charms that turn grey beards to dotage: But the fixt bent and nature of the heart Rendering each gift a blessing or a curse Are not at our disposal. If these fail, Truth never more shall fix her seal on brow Of mortal mold. Be but their faith unchang'd, When next we meet we reign in fairy land. Farewell! tho' on a vision of a dream Hope fondly rest, (to the attendant Fairies)—Ye! hail her golden beam. (Oberon and Titania ascend, and are borne away in their aerial cars. Chorus of FAIRIES. Hail golden Hope—we heard the King, And shall again on boundless wing, At will our revelry renew, And pledg'd in acorn bowls, sip heav'n's ambrosial dew. 1st. FAIRY —Solo. On earth when Eve's pale twilight gleams, I, on the gossamer with viewless pace, The moon will challenge to the race: And laugh to see her swiftest beams Silvering the web that dances in the wind, Glide, as I reach the goal, a fairy's length behind. 2nd. FAIRY —Solo. I, o'er the sea my course will take, And catch with unwet feet the lessning sail That vanishes before the gale— And sliding in its level wake, Number the sparkles of the foamy tide, That, glittering o'er the prow, stream radiance far and wide. 3rd FAIRY —Solo. I, thro' the path of air will soar, And when the summer meteor flames afar, Swifter than glance of shooting star, Will flash its transient course before: While scatter'd from my wings in dew-drops bright The rain-bow's lunar arch o'er-canopy's my flight. 4th FAIRY —Solo. I, on the sun's slope beam will ride, And as it sinks th'atlantic wave beneath, From clouds of roseate lustre wreathe My robes of light, by fancy dy'd: Fringe with etherial braid my new-fledg'd wing, Then spread its feathery pomp, and fan the fairy king. CHORUS. Hail golden hope! we heard the king, And shall again on boundless wing, At will our revelry renew, And pledg'd in acorn bowls, sip heav'n's ambrosial dew. End of ACT 2nd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. (Lamp-light.) The bridge over the Tygris—The outside of Salma's cot, in the suburbs of Bagdad. Ariel and Fairies enter, with baskets of fruit. ARIEL. Spirits! here Huon comes—here rests at night In Salma's straw-thatch'd cot—breathe o'er your fruits Pure fragrance from the bow'rs of fairy land— So deck her board—then in rich trappings grac'd Caparison the barb, and from the woof Of elfine looms, bring Huon's robe of state, Fit robe for royal guest at bridal feasts. Chorus of FAIRIES. We breathe, and o'er these fruits expand Fragrance stol'n from fairy land. Solo—1st. FAIRY. These grapes, where liquid rubies glow, And amethysts of purple hue, To autumn suns no color owe: Beneath the fairy glance they grew. I saw them linger in the barren shade, And on their clust'ring orbs new life and lustre ray'd. Solo—2nd. FAIRY. And o'er this peach the down I spread From fleeces spun in fairy loom, And o'er the plumb its azure shed Dropt from the dust that shades my plume, That when young Zephyr woo'd me to his bow'r, Stream'd from my ruffled wing, and fell in feathery show'r. CHORUS. We breathe, and o'er these fruits expand Fragrance stol'n from fairy land. (Fairies go into Salma's cot. SALMA enters. It was the Tartar king—swift from my sight He vanish'd like a spectre—yet I knew him. And had not this good crutch thus propt my limbs, Here had I fall'n, without a friend to aid, So rudely he brush'd by me—well—'tis late— I'll to my cot—no stranger youth this night Will cross my threshold—(as Salma is going to her cot, Huon and Eustace enter from a different part.) EUSTACE. Welcome, Knight! to Bagdad! Heav'n knows what other voice shall bid you welcome! (seeing Salma)—Ha! 'tis a female—not in form inviting: Yet will I greet the dame with courteous speech. Most gracious lady! SALMA. Speak you, Sir, to me? EUSTACE. I see none but yourself, and your sweet shadow Reflected by the lamp-light—pity us, Fair lady! here, unknowing, and unknown, We roam. SALMA. A civil gentleman, forsooth— Yet—by his garb, no courtier. Sir, what want you? HUON. We are benighted strangers, tir'd with travel— SALMA. How! strangers! ah, perchance, the expected knight! Come to my cot: and on the morrow seek More suited quarters— HUON. None more grateful, trust me, Than yours so kindly offer'd. 'Tis the welcome, And not the cost that makes the cheerful guest. SALMA —(seating them in her cot.) What tempting fruit! no doubt my Mirza's gift— Take them—their very fragrance feasts the sense— Nay—take them—be at home: 'tis but a cottage, Yet dear to Salma. Here I live unvext. Day after day glides o'er me, while I hum Tunes of my youth. Aye, Sirs, while here I press My straw with brow unruffled, many a heart Sighs beneath golden roofs. EUSTACE —(aside.) She's not mistaken. SALMA. I guess what brings you hither—here you swarm, All for one object. What a hive of strangers! The caravans to Mecca are less crowded. All for the morrow's feast—good fortune guides you. Our Sultan's daughter weds: to-morrow weds. (aside)—He seems most strangely mov'd.—(To Huon) I like your looks, Such looks hide no false heart—discreet I'll warrant. HUON. Nay—tell me all— EUSTACE —(aside.) Sir, interrupt her not— SALMA. I promis'd not to tell: never reveal it. The princess loathes the man. She'd rather clasp A dragon, than the Tartar, in her arms. HUON. Why weds she whom she loathes? SALMA. The Tartar Conqueror O'er-ran our realm, and as the price of peace, Demanded Rezia's hand. Who could resist? With fierce Horasbec march'd Circassia's Prince Of giant strength and size: throughout the East Fam'd for his beauteous sister; and more fam'd For his enchanted bracelet. He, who wears it, Conquers without a blow. 'Tis strange, you say: Yet I have stranger news—guess why fair Rezia Detests this king— HUON. Oh say— SALMA. She dies—for love— HUON. For love—of whom? SALMA. Alas! she ne'er beheld him, Save in a dream— HUON and EUSTACE. A dream! a dream! SALMA. Nay, hear it. That fierce Horasbec follow'd her, on sudden Chang'd to a roe, o'er dreary solitudes: And when his hand was stretch'd, in act to seize her, At once within a car by lions drawn A beauteous boy appear'd—at sight of him The Tartar monarch fled—On drove the boy, And by a touch of his rais'd lily-wand Restor'd our Rezia to her native charms— Then— HUON. A fair boy! by lions drawn! EUSTACE. By lions! SALMA. He bad her mount the car, where by his side A lovely stranger sat, with golden locks, And eye—like yours—blue as the cloudless heav'n. At once their mutual glances mixt their hearts. Then suddenly the car against a stone Struck, and the enchanted vision fled away. But from her heart he never fled, the Knight With eye of blue, and locks of golden wave. HUON. Oh my prophetic spirit! SALMA. From that time The Princess scorns the king; and lonely weeps In secret: nor can ought relieve her woe Save what augments her love—yet what avails it? To-morrow Rezia sinks a breathless corse In the fierce Tartar's arms— HUON. No—first the globe Crumbles to atoms—there, the Knight himself Shall share the feast, and claim the promis'd bride. SALMA. Aye—say you so—'tis strangely marvellous— His eye—complexion—hair—speak favor'd youth! Tell me— HUON. O'ertir'd with long fatigue I faint— To-morrow, my kind hostess—oh, to-morrow! Each moment is eternity—farewell— I must retire to rest. SALMA —(pointing to a chamber.) There—angels guard you! Good night! and may such dreams as love inspires Steal time away, then wake, and find them true— (shewing a place to Eustace.) Here rest your limbs. EUSTACE. Thanks, gentle dame—fatigue Seeks not a couch of down—(going) SALMA. Tho' late the hour, Fast as this crutch can aid my feeble limbs, I'll bear the won'drous tale to Rezia's ear. (Exit. SCENE changes to Rezia's apartment. REZIA —rising from her couch. Ah! whither art thou fled, enchanting youth? To these fond arms, that clasp thy shade, return! Hear, while my lip now plights eternal truth, Breathe on my cheek where virgin blushes burn. Yet if alone a vision of the night Thou glide to charm in sleep my tear away, Come as I close my eyes, and loathe the light, Here, on my heart thy hand sweet spirit! lay, And say, as at thy touch its pulses move, “So never bosom beat for earthly love.” MIRZA enters. Methought I heard your voice—sweet Rezia soothe Your woe in sleep. REZIA. Enchanting shade! return! Ah whither art thou fled—return once more! MIRZA. Oh tell me, why that cheek, which late so pale Droop'd like a lily broken by the storm, Glows with the blush of health: and why those eyes, Long clouded o'er with tears of hopeless woe, Sparkle, as if some vision in the air Flew, rob'd in bliss before you. REZIA. I beheld him. It was no phantom of the night—I saw him More beauteous than a God—his tender lip Kist off the tear that on my eye-lid hung— I fain had fled, but his melodious voice Breath'd witchery on mine ear. You turn away— You sigh—you will not speak—that sigh, that silence I will interpret— MIRZA. Could I breathe a sound That utter'd might console you, then these lips Had not been mute— REZIA. Oh! if you love me, Mirza, Oh rend not with rude hand the shadowy veil That hides with show of bliss, the precipice O'er whose steep brink I bend—I have but hope— Why, why resign it? soon the silver cymbals Ring with shrill clang, and echoing thousands rend The sky with joyful shout—I, I, the victim Must hasten to the sacrifice. MIRZA. Sweet Rezia! She hears me not—it is your Mirza speaks— Look on me, by these tears I do conjure you! Despair in each fixt feature seems to brave The dangers that surround her— REZIA. On they float, Gay thousands shouting to the bridal feast: The bride prepares her for the funeral. The voice of death has called me, and my soul Echoes the summons—if th'expected knight, My plighted lord, heav'n-destin'd, fail to shield me, Horasbec clasps a corse. MIRZA. Prevent it, heav'n! (a loud knocking at the door)—What sudden noise? (Mirza goes. REZIA. Haste Mirza—shadowy dream! If with delusive charm thou has beguil'd My fascinated fancy: if thy hues Melt like the clouds whose transient colors fade Before the sun that gilds them, what remains But death to rescue me? MIRZA running in with Salma. Joy! Princess, joy! He's found, the Knight is found. REZIA. Delightful Mirza, Where is my brave deliverer? MIRZA —to Salma. Tell the tale— Aye, o'er and o'er repeat each joyful word. REZIA. Speak, speak, good Salma! SALMA. Thus 'tis with you all— A princess, or a peasant, no distinction— All ear when love's the subject—first, he came REZIA. Who came? SALMA. In my lone cot but now I left him. REZIA. Left whom? SALMA. The Knight, the Knight—eye, hair, shape, all— MIRZA. It tallys with the dream— SALMA. Yes—eye of blue— And long long locks that float like waves of gold— Shape—oh your Bagdad courtiers show like boors Before this foreign God—now you must know, It chanc'd, I know not how, the youth bewitch'd me, Or I had ne'er let slip the slightest hint Of your prophetic dream—but when I told it, In confidence—oh had you seen the youth— His eye struck fire, and in his cheek the blood Rush'd—like—your own—aye, aye, you're pair'd in heav'n. REZIA. Haste, Salma, tell the Knight his bride awaits him. (They all depart. SCENE changes to Salma's cot. Ariel and Fairies enter, displaying different parts of a magnificent Eastern dress. ARIEL. Say, Fays, are your charges in all featly done? To my wand, as I wave, duly nod, one by one. 1st. FAIRY. Hark! hark, to that neigh—'twas the wing'd Arab steed. Not the rack of the night-storm out-races his speed. 2nd. FAIRY. With sapphires and emeralds his trappings I grac'd. 3rd. FAIRY. And he foams upon gold by my hand quaintly chas'd— 4th. FAIRY. In eve's glowing mantle at sweet summer tide, Two pages 1st. FAIRY. I prank'd them, 4th. FAIRY. parade at each side. 1st. FAIRY. Look, look on this sabre. ALL. One diamond it shines. 1st. FAIRY. I forg'd it unheard in the Gnome's central mines. 2nd. FAIRY. The gems on this turban, I fill'd, one by one, With light from noon-beams of the tropical sun. 3rd. FAIRY. And the tints on this robe that gleam changeful in hue, From the rain-bow I caught, as it vanish'd from view. ARIEL. These, on yon couch in order lay, And weal or woe betide, When Huon goes to greet his bride, Fays! viewless tend him on his way. CHORUS. Pleas'd thy order we obey, And viewless tend him on his way.

'Twas shrewdly said that wonders never cease— Yet this surpasses thought—a lovely youth, Destin'd for Rezia—yet there are forsooth, Who laugh at dreams, and call us fools who trust them. Yet sure 'tis time to rouse th'expected knight. I am no witch, not I, yet well I know What vision charms his sleep. Yet ah, 'tis late. At mid-day Rezia weds—scarce two hours hence— 'Twere sin to let him clasp th'unreal shade, And that stern king the substance. EUSTACE enters. My kind hostess Know you yon pretty pages, spangled o'er With liveries like the light! proudly they hold A neighing barb, richly caparison'd, Close at your cottage door—now, as I enter'd, They bade me seek my lord. SALMA —(looking out and returning.) I know them not, Sweet beauteous pages! such a steed! all fire— Gold bit, and housings wreath'd with sparkling gems! Our Caliph owns not such. EUSTACE. Well—I will rouse him. Come forth, my lord— SALMA —(as Huon enters magnificently robed in an Eastern dress.) Oh Mahomet! defend me! It is the Sultan's self— HUON. Fear not, kind hostess! SALMA. There's witchery here—I never brought the robe— Fair Rezia sent it not. EUSTACE. Aye, aye, no doubt, 'Twas he, the giver of the golden bowl— HUON —(to himself). 'Tis now the destin'd time. SALMA. It suits you rarely: Fits like a charm: from head to foot, all right. All, save these locks of gold that loosely wave: They must not float thus—Knight! give me the turban. So hide these ringlets—(she puts it on Huon's head.) HUON. Eustace, my soul glows— Hostess! farewell! let these rich jewels thank thee— One moment leave us. SALMA. Heav'n preserve your life! Farewell—the bride expects you.—(Salma goes.) HUON. On I haste—(to Eustace.) To death, or bliss immortal—rest thou here. These gems of rarest value ill express My grateful heart. EUSTACE. Bribe me to stay, Sir Huon! Old Eustace like a coward hide his head When you encounter danger, face to face! No—if you live, I live; if there you fall, At once the welcome wound shall rescue Eustace From the keen anguish of long-lingering woe. Lead on— HUON. What gift can pay thee? EUSTACE. What I feel: Fond hope to guard brave Seg?in's honor'd son— Lead on—kind Oberon protect thy friend! HUON. Death, and mail'd Chiefs in vain the bride enclose. Love, Vengeance, Fame, rebuke my long delay. (Exeunt. SCENE—Banquet-Hall in the Sultan's Palace. Enter on one side, Horasbec, Almansor, Almansaris, with their suite—on the other the Sultan and Rezia, with their attendants—Priests, Emirs, Slaves, Guards, &amp;c. CHORUS. Bagdad! rend with joy the air! Asia! thy peopled empires o'er, Echo the hymn from shore to shore: While heav'n, consenting to our pray'r, With glory crowns Horasbec's brow, And seals with Houri bliss, fair Rezia's nuptial vow! (At the conclusion of the Song, as the Sultan leads Rezia to give her hand to Horasbec, Huon and Eustace enter.) HUON —(on seeing the Bridegroom.) Ah! 'tis the vile blasphemer! fell assassin Behold the son of Seg?in—face to face To proof of arms I dare thee— ALMANSOR —(shewing his arm with the magic bracelet.) Tartar monarch! This arm defends thee. HORASBEC —(stopping Almansor.) 'Tis a beardless boy. Thus I chastise thy insolence.—(They fight—Huon is victorious.) HUON. Die, murderer! 'Tis Rezia—tis herself—(seeing the Bride, who recognises his likeness to the vision as his turban falls off.) REZIA. Oh wondrous sight! 'Tis he—th'enchanting dream deceiv'd me not. ALMANSARIS. What grace! what dignity! no mortal form! Sure fabling poets, from such visions, shap'd The God of love— HUON —(embracing Rezia, and slipping a ring on her finger.) With this I join our hands: And, heav'n-united, thus before the world, Huon proclaims his bride. CALIPH to Rezia. Thou suffer this! A Christian Knight stain'd with the bridegroom's blood, To clasp thee in his arms! (The Emirs, Guards, &amp;c. rush on Huon and Eustace, who defend themselves.) EUSTACE —(advancing before Huon, and striking on every side with his cedar club.) Now, son of Segwin! Thus shall they fall before you. CALIPH. Seize them, slaves! ALMANSOR. Let me approach— EMIRS —rushing before him. Thou Christian dog!—Our Prophet Thus roots you from the earth. HUON. Bite thou the ground! ALMANSARIS —(seising Almansor's arm.) Slay not that Knight! EMIRS. Die, wretch! REZIA —(darting thro' the throng, and throwing her arms round Huon. He bleeds, he falls! Back slaves! I aid the hero—to his breast Behold the passage. Rezia's heart his shield. Strike here—so slaughter him—death, death unites us. Spare him, my Sire. He comes, by heav'n ordain'd To claim my nuptial vow. EMIRS —(rushing on) Root him from earth. REZIA —(swoons in Huon's arms.) Farewell—farewell—a thousand weapons smite us. EUSTACE —(seising the horn round Huon's neck, and violently blowing it.) Now blast of thunder! hear it, Elf-king! hear! (Oberon descends from a cloud—the adversaries of Huon fall motionless.) OBERON. Thus far success is thine, intrepid Huon. And matchless the reward. Behold the bride; Best gift of heav'n. Yet never may thy hand Lead her in triumph to thy native realm, 'Till direst proofs confirm your mutual faith Fixt on the base of virtue. Thou, too, Rezia, Pause, lest in after time, thou, hapless, mourn A fleet delusion, and with vain regret Weep, void of hope. Can Rezia, then, forego Pow'r, and the imperial pomp of Bagdad's throne; And stand the dread vicissitudes of fate? Reflect fond maid! if these thy soul appall, Oh heed my warning voice! renounce the Knight. These, seeming breathless, as I wave my wand Arise. The Caliph shall forgive his child, The past no more remember'd. Now, decide, Now free, and never more. REZIA —(sinks in Huon's arms.) Oh! bid me not again decide! When on my dream the vision play'd, Fondly I clasp'd his plighted shade: Not death itself shall now divide. The throne of Asia I resign: Huon, my soul is pledg'd to thine. OBERON. Oh be ye blest! Yet, ah! this heart-felt sigh marks Oberon's fear. Huon of Bourdeaux! thou hast dauntless stood The test of valour. Youth, now arm thy soul For conflict where seductive passion views The conqueror that has smil'd on death's mail'd brow, Melt, and bow down in willing bondage chain'd. Such, thou must now withstand.—(looking on the adversaries of Huon.) Their trance dissolves. Brave Knight! before Almanzor's magic bracelet, Withering the arm of valour, thine must droop Infirm to ward or wound. My pow'r avails not: Virtue alone can aid thee. In dread silence Fate seals my lip. Be virtuous. Bliss is thine. (As Oberon ascends his aerial car and vanishes in thunder and lightening, the adversaries of Huon start from their trance. Huon and Eustace fall motionless, as Almansor stretches towards them his arm girt with the enchanted bracelet.—Rezia swoons on Huon.) CALIPH. Force Rezia from his arms—Guards! seize those slaves! Ere long their limbs shall feed the funeral pyre. Exeunt omnes. SCENE changes to the enchanted Wood, Oberon lying restless on a rocky ledge, overshaded by gloomy mountains.—Fairies floating in airy dance round him. ARIEL. Soft as the moon at midnight still, Or shades that sweep a sunny hill, Or a night-spirit slides away, When the first cock calls up the day, Float in light ring his couch around, And sleep entice with soothing sound: While at each measur'd pause I call The music of the waterfall, And low airs from the leafy dell, When meek eve bids the sun farewell. OBERON. Sweet Ariel! sooth my soul with gentle song! ARIEL. Viewless minstrel! touch the lute, Tun'd to my cadence soft and slow; Chain each rude wind! all sounds be mute, Save those that solace woe. Save those that from the Æolian lyre To whispers of a Sylph reply, And vibrate o'er the enchanted wire Faint murmurs of a melody. Or those that wind thro' wreathed shell At summer-tide when sea-maids float, And on the spring-flood's moon-light swell, Night-ditties chant, that, note by note, Charm'd echo from her coral cave, Breathes o'er the bosom of the wave. OBERON. Cease, cease the song—'tis vain—all harmony Is discord to my ear—my soul is sad, And such to me all nature—whate'er tempts Of soft or smooth the touch: sounds sweetest heard, From night's lone warbler, or melodious strain; Whate'er of nature's scenes, sublime or mild: And all that charms the sense in fruit and flow'r, Delight by native excellence the mind Pleas'd with itself—but to the mind diseas'd All outward objects seem to change their nature; Reflecting but the hue, and gloomy colour Caught from the soul—away, and leave me here, To brood in viewless misery. ARIEL. Say not so! I long have serv'd thee, in the earth and air, Nor fear'd in briny floods to wet my wings, Nor singe my ringlets where the roaring flames Clos'd on my passage—do not bid me leave thee; But to a soul in smpathy with thine Confide thy sorrow. OBERON. Thou hast serv'd me well, And more from love than duty—Ariel! stay— Yet—these sad thoughts— ARIEL. Brood not in silence o'er them. 'Twill but increase the suffering. Grief, that vents Th'entrusted sorrow on some friendly breast, Feels lighten'd of a load. OBERON. My Ariel! Persuasive is thy voice of sympathy. 'Twere vain to hide my woe. On yonder cloud That, dark as starless night, o'er-canopys The rock on which I weep, behold imprest What weighs upon my heart.—(A vision on the cloud represents Huon chained in prison.) ARIEL. On yon dark cloud, As if some pencil dipt in Stygian hue Had trac'd the portraiture, I see a youth Chain'd in a loathsome dungeon. OBERON. Closer look. ARIEL. It bears the semblance of that gallant Knight. Alas! that sight may swell e'en Oberon's fear. Oh! let me loose his chains, and I will bear them Gladly, nor shrink while the revolving sun Toils round his yearly course. OBERON. No, gentle Ariel: Fate wills not so. Severest trials wait him. The Knight has look'd on death, nor chang'd his hue: Now beauty's tempting witcheries assail him. The wonder of the world, the fair Circassian Lives but for him. Ah! tho' my wish at once Could waft the youth beyond this visual world, He must withstand the enchantress, or thy king No more shall fix Titania on his throne. What means that dreadful portent? lo! the form (The vision on the cloud vanishes.) Now vanishes; and thro' the severing clouds Yon star of evil aspect glares on me. TITANIA —(unseen.) Oberon! OBERON. Ha! 'tis Titania's voice. TITANIA enters, and swoons in Oberon's arms. Oh Oberon! One last farewell. Fate severs us for ever. OBERON. For ever! oh that death had empire o'er us! (To Ariel.) Wave round her brow reviving airs. TITANIA —(recovering.) Farewell! We meet no more. OBERON. Ah whence this deep despair? Huon is rarely temper'd. TITANIA. None of earth Can stand this trial. Hear, and hopeless mourn. Late, as I lonely wept, on sudden heard, A summoning voice thus rous'd me.—Yet I hear it. “Thou! that hast sully'd thy once spotless soul “With jealous taint, polluting thy pure nature “With frailties of the race of earth-born man, “Go, expiate thy offence, in guise and mood “Most loath'd by elfine purity. Assume “Semblance of one by lawless love enflam'd: “And with that lip whose native innocence “Immingled soul with soul in elfine bliss, “Like a seductress woo. While magic dreams “Entrance Almansaris, bear thou her form “Gifted with every grace of fairy charm. “Call in the aid of dance and melody, “And lure of royal sway: nor fail to urge “Death's dire alternative. So tempt the Knight. “And, if he yield—I swoon'd, and heard no more. I woke, and call'd on thee. (A voice from one unseen.) —Titania. TITANIA. Ha! It is the summoning voice. (The Voice.) Come forth— 'Tis now the destin'd time. (Oberon and Titania embracing.) Farewell! Farewell! Exeunt omnes. SCENE changes to an apartment in the Caliph's palace. Rezia—Almansor—Nadina. ALMANSOR —(to Nadina.) This signet take—at sight of it, the guards Unbar the prison gates—o'er Huon cast Robes fit for royal suitor—so attend him Usher'd in pomp and splendor to the palace Of fair Almansaris—hence— NADINA. I obey—(Exit.) ALMANSOR. Rezia! thou must forget him— REZIA. Never—never. ALMANSOR. Almansor long has loved thee, long concealed The passion that consum'd him—ah! beware, Urge not by unavailing scorn my soul To ruthless violence. REZIA. Cease, cease, Almansor. My soul is wedded to another. ALMANSOR. Hear me— No earthly force withstands my magic pow'r. Rezia I all command. REZIA. Not Rezia's heart— Pure love, and spotless faith that grav'd in heav'n My witness'd vow, shall triumph o'er the pow'r Of spell, and breath'd enchantment— ALMANSOR. Dost thou scorn me? I will not waste vain words to soothe thy pride— Consent—or force— REZIA —(drawing a dagger.) Behold this listed dagger— Advance, I fall a breathless corse before thee— Why should I live? Ah, haply, thou, lov'd Huon, Art mine no more. ALMANSOR. Live, Rezia, live for vengeance— Oh come, and I will force him from the arms That clasp his neck—he dyes in torturing pangs. REZIA. No—if false Huon in another's arms Can taste of bliss, be Rezia's silent tear His only torture. False youth! for whom I die, still lov'd in death, Catch the last whisper of my less'ning breath; Its prayer shall soothe thy pang at life's decline. Oh come! and ere my spirit pass away, Kiss my cold lip, and bending o'er me, say, “Peace to thy soul, wrong'd maid! that pardon'd mine!” ALMANSOR. Rezia! thou hast a father. On thy word His life depends—beware—when next we meet, Consent, or view thy sire in tortures dye. Exeunt. SCENE changes to a gloomy dungeon. Huon and Eustace in chains. EUSTACE. Not for myself I grieve—distress and Eustace Have long held fellowship—slow years on years Have turn'd these hairs to grey; nor seen a smile Steal o'er my furrow'd cheek, but yours has been Sun'd by unceasing joy—it will have vent, Pardon me, master—thou, in bloom of youth, In the fair season when each day is summer! And the sweet Princess— HUON. Eustace—name her not, Or grief will swell to frenzy. EUSTACE. Hark! what sound? The pond'rous gate rings on its jarring hinge. Look, Sir, a female form—(Nadina, and slaves enter.) NADINA —to the slaves. Unlink these fetters— Knight! follow me— HUON. Fair visitant! whoe'er— NADINA. Haste, haste, and follow me— HUON. I stirr not hence, 'Till this, my other self, is free as I am— EUSTACE. Think not of me—oh anger not the lady. HUON. Our fate is one—we live or die together. NADINA —to the slaves. Free him—(to Huon.)—thy will is law—we but thy slaves— Away—to happiness I guide thy step. Exeunt. SCENE changes to the palace of Almansaris, decorated with the utmost magnificence—Titania in the form of Almansaris, on a throne, surrounded by female dancers and musicians; and beautiful girls weaving wreaths of roses. Nadina enters, leading in Huon—at his entrance they sing and dance. HUON —(starts back.) What may this mean? NADINA —(leading him forward.) To happiness I guide you. HUON. 'Tis Rezia's self—no other form on earth Boasts such resistless charms—strange wonder awes me— Methinks some hand invisible restrains My lingering footsteps— TITANIA. Fear not, lovely youth! Thou art not come an uninvited guest. HUON. I see, yet doubt my sight—delusive visions Gild fancy's transient day-dreams— TITANIA. Look around thee— What show of false presentment mocks thy sight? These are thy slaves that hail their lord's approach: The roof yet echoes with the song of welcome. Fear not the form that beckons thee—approach— HUON. Ah, no—it is not Rezia—walls of gold, The diamond-studded throne, yon pendent lights, Each brilliant as a planet in its course, Deceiv'd my dazzled sight—oh pardon me, Fair lady! speak thy will— TITANIA. Say, lovely knight! Hast thou forgotten me? HUON. I, ne'er till now Gaz'd on thy won'drous charms. TITANIA. Yet, beauteous youth! This hand preserv'd thy life, this breast thy shield, When o'er thy brow a thousand scymetars Flash'd instant death— HUON. I saw but one alone Who still at hazard of her life, sav'd mine— Oh pardon! lady, that a lover's eye Sole fixt on her, ne'er turn'd aside to gaze On thy transcendant beauty— TITANIA —(descending from her throne, and clasping his hand.) This hand preserv'd thee: This hand that presses thine, and at the touch Glows with new ardor. (Spare me, ruthless fate!—aside) The blood is fled that sun'd thy glowing cheek. The fire of love that lighten'd in thy glance No longer beams. (Yet, yet the youth resists—aside.) (To the attendants) Now rouse his drooping spirits—swell the song. Ye round him float with limbs that glide in air: And mid the tuneful labyrinth enwreathe him With chains of rosy twine. So lead the knight A willing captive to the throne of love. (They dance in measure to the following Song, and bind Huon in wreaths of roses.) Knight as round thy limbs we wreathe Soft chains that blue-eyed pleasures wove, Come, where no clarions battle breathe, But beauty heaves the sigh of love. The hauberk's twisted links resign For blooming braid of roseate flow'rs, And pitch thy tent beneath the vine Whose tendrils clasp Circassia's bow'rs. Seize the sweet prime—enjoy thy May. Each moment charm with new delight: Ere borne on youth's fleet wing away, Love and pleasure speed their flight; And thou shalt droop, ere life is fled, Like one long number'd with the dead. HUON. No—I will gaze no more—lest Syren charms Seduce the entangled sense. (aside)—Oh virgin bride! Beam thy chaste influence over me. TITANIA. Cease—away—(her attendants depart.) Oh be no longer mute: no ear shall catch The sigh thou breath'st, but mine by love attun'd. HUON. Lady! on one unworthy— TITANIA. Say not so— Th'omnipotence of love around thee beams Beauty's resistless radiance. Why that gloom? Ah why that pensive silence? I have seen The eye of adoration gaze on me As on a worshipped goddess. (Takes a lute, and sings.) Ah! why lov'd youth, this coy delay? Oh let my eye but glance on thine, Thou too wilt gaze thy soul away, And feel the flame that glows in mine, Then, as our looks each other fire, Catch from my burning lip the trance of sweet desire. HUON. Cease thy seductive strains! oh beauteous lady, Reserve those matchless charms, that faultless form Soft molded by the graces, for the arms Of some blest youth, whose heart, not pledg'd like mine. Shall glow with mutual ardor. TITANIA. (Virtuous youth—aside.) Yet—yet awhile reflect! nor slight this hand! Thy fate depends on me—decide thy doom— Does beauty tempt? Almansaris is thine— Does boundless empire tempt? my pow'r shall lift thee To heights beyond the gaze of pale-ey'd envy. Reflect—mid fiery tortures death awaits thee. Decide thy doom. HUON. The will of heav'n has fixt it— Heav'n heard my vow: and sacred love unites Huon and Rezia. TITANIA. Death dissolves the tye— Slaves!—(they enter)—hence, and hurl this traytor to the dungeon—(Huon is led away.) My dreadful task is o'er. Heroic Huon! So Rezia firmly meet fate's direst blow! And love in purest bliss end all our woe. End of ACT 4th.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. The Caliph's Palace. Caliph—and Almansor's Page. PAGE. Caliph of Bagdad! thus Almansor speaks— “Thy warriors, thy selected chiefs in arms “Fled, ere I struck—come forth, and at my summons “Before assembled Bagdad, bring my bride, “The heiress of thy throne— CALIPH. From mortal arm I may not hope deliverance—I obey— Go—bid my daughter hither—(Page goes)—gracious heav'n! Thus at the close of life, when hoary hairs Most claim due reverence:—at the weary close, When, nature shrinking from the turmoil, seeks Repose from worldly woe—now, must I crouch At a proud conqueror's nod.—(Rezia and the Page enter.) My child!— REZIA —(in sable robes.) Oh speak. Thou hast a daughter left— CALIPH. Alas my child! These melancholy weeds that mark thy woe, Will raise the tyrant's fury—hapless Rezia! Array thyself once more in bridal robes— Gems and resplendent ornaments must cast Their blaze around thee, and supply the bloom That grief has cankered in the cheek of youth. REZIA. Let me depart, and my sad life devote To solitude and tears—I had not thought To have expos'd my grief to human eye, Nor to have breath'd in human ear the woe That preys upon my heart—my father! PAGE. Caliph! The impatient conqueror waits—He, who commands, Brooks not delay— CALIPH. Let the stern victor rage— I was not born to shake at earthly threat— Ah! tho' imperial pride bow down before him, Nature has higher claims—yet all I ask Is but to shed a solitary tear O'er a lov'd child—(to Rezia)—To save a father's life Could'st thou consent— REZIA. To sacrifice my own? Most willingly—oh! I will smile on death As on a gentle friend, whose sheltering arms Sooth me, and still each pang of earthly grief— Sweet comes o'er hopeless woe the call of death, Like the lov'd voice of one whom dreams restore. “Oh rest!” it whispers with assuasive breath, “Rest in the silent spot with those that weep no more!” Say, what my doom? CALIPH. Thou must in bridal robes Meet stern Almansor. REZIA. Grieve not thus, my sire! 'Tis not these charms alone, 'tis empire tempts him. Resign proud Asia's throne—Oh come with me, And I will lead thee to some lonely spot Where peace shall visit thee—oh, if thou wish To sooth my sorow, let me lighten thine— The spirit of o'erflowing tenderness Shall steal thy woes away—and thou shalt sink In heav'n's due time within thy daughter's arms, As in a tranquil sleep—resign thy sceptre— Peace be our lot! PAGE. Almansor claims thy hand— The conqueror summons, where assembled Bagdad Shall view the knight, that scorn'd Circassia's charms, In flames expire— REZIA. That scorn'd Almansaris! He dies in flames! Thou! whom my soul adores, Rezia shall save thee—(to the Page)—to Almansor haste, If by all dreaded Mahomet he swear To guard uninjured to his native realm The stranger Knight; and fix on Asia's throne My honor'd Sire—(gives him a ring)—bring this, and I will wear it As his connubial gift—else, death shall free me. Exeunt. SCENE changes to the Prison. Huon and Eustace. EUSTACE. In sooth I found them hospitable ladies— Sir, while those wonders blaz'd before your sight, Gems, and gold walls, and lights that dimm'd the sun, And bevys of gay girls that swept the lute, And wanton'd in the labyrinth of the dance, I was not left neglected— HUON —(to himself, regardless of Eustace.) Still my soul! Soon will this torture cease— EUSTACE. They spread before me Viands, and wine that foam'd in golden flaggons; And dainty damsels beckon'd me to banquet. All bad me welcome: and they smil'd, like friends, Familiar with my features— HUON. When I think On each event, that, in the crouded compass Of a few transient hours, has teem'd with wonders Surpassing human credence, much I doubt If truth, or vivid fancy formed the scene. If truth, the heated brain o'er midnight bowls Shapes not such fantasies— EUSTACE. Sir, feel you not These ponderous chains? such metal, of this weight, Was never forg'd in visions. HUON. Rezia, Rezia! Was it a vision when this lip prest thine? Thou too, my faithful friend! it grieves my soul, I brought thee hither: I, alone, the cause That death, mid torturing agonies, shall close Thy course of honor— EUSTACE. Grieve not for old Eustace. It quite unmans me—I had fain, indeed, Have laid these bones beneath my native earth With those, (heav'n bless them) who once sweetly smil'd, When in their arms I lay a wimpering babe. Such thoughts, yet more thy kindness, good my lord, Force out these tears. Yet, after all, that spirit Once seeming friendly—no, in sooth—I dare not; Else, Sir, these iron cramps that bind me down, And the foul air, and intercepted day That thro' the net-work of yon grated loop-hole Umbers our countenance with sickly hue: These are sad tokens that the wily elf But lur'd us to deceive— HUON. Distrust him not. Superior pow'r o'er-rules him—Fairy king! Tho' all the princely honors that enwreath'd My cradled brow: tho' all that youth fair vison'd Picturing fame's temple with heroic forms: Tho' all the glorious deeds that grac'd my sires, Each above each tow'ring in high desert: Should vanish, with the memory of Huon, Unknown, and unlamented—Fairy king! No whisper of reproach shall stain my lip; Nor death in torture shake my trust in heav'n, Whose angel o'er the brow of innocence, Extends his viewless shield— SONG by an invisible spirit. Tho' night-storms wildly rave When rolls the wreck upon the tumbling wave: Tho' from his viper hair Death shake the spotted pest that taints the air: He, who in heav'n has trust, While worlds beneath him crumble into dust, Looks with uplifted eyes, Where hope her anchor rests, and points to opening skys. HUON. Heav'nly minstrel! My strengthen'd spirit thanks thee— EUSTACE. Sir, the air Was sweet: the voice and finger closely wedded, And tho' I saw him not, my ear's not dull— 'Twas the same minstrel that did charm my cave. Yet had th'invisible warbler at the close, Hung round your neck the horn, and grac'd my hand With the gold cup, the tune had mainly pleas'd— Hark! heard you not?—(the sound of unbarring the prison is heard.) HUON. Along the vaulted cells Some footstep echoes loud—and gleaming lights Stream thro' the dungeon's depth—the ministers Of death now claim us—oh that I alone Might satiate their revenge, and thou, my friend, Hadst ne'er beheld the face of Seg?in's son! (Rezia, and attendants enter. EUSTACE. Sir, we can die but once—it is herself— This is no minister of death. HUON. Oh form Once visionary seen, and ne'er forgotten! Thou! whom a fairy pencil highly wrought, Yet with faint hue dishonor'd— REZIA. Thou art free— Slaves! loose their chains—haste to thy native land! There never be the name of Rezia heard: There never more a vision of the night Retrace her shade!—ah, no—when far away, Ah let a tender thought, in happier hours, Dwell on the fond remembrance of a maid, Who, tho' she urge thee hence, with ceaseless tears Will weep when thou art absent— EUSTACE. He forget thee! No—were he tomb'd, and should some passing stranger Chance unawares to whisper near his grave The name of Rezia, his awaken'd spirit Would rive the sepulchre. HUON. I leave thee here To weep my absence! Life, without thee, Rezia, Were agony beyond death's torturing flames— No earthly pow'r shall part us— REZIA. Oh for ever farewell—I implore thee to leave me— To a maiden more blest, far from Rezia remove, Yet, clasp'd in her arms, Huon! say, nor deceive me, Thou wilt shed on her bosom one tear for my love. On my knees I do beseech thee, hence—more dire than death Horror will rack thy soul—oh! thou wilt loathe Her whom thou lov'st— HUON. Hear me! heav'n-destin'd bride! REZIA. Thy bride! ah Huon!— CALIPH. enters. Come, my child! away— The time is past—this hand must lead thee forth— Knight! thou art free—hence to thy native realm. Fly from the misery thou hast caus'd. HUON. Oh speak— Who, who has freed me? CALIPH. Rezia. REZIA. Ask no more— Depart—or view me breathless at thy feet. CALIPH. Knight! to restore thee to thy native land, And free a helpless sire from torturing death This unexampled daughter— REZIA. Oh, my father! If ere thy child was dear to thee, conceal it! HUON. Say, what the sacrifice? CALIPH. Virtue shall grave In golden characters—“behold the Maid, “Who for another's life, resign'd her own “To voluntary woe”—I haste to give To stern Almansor— REZIA. Oh!—(swoons) HUON. A breathless corse— Sweet Rezia! soft—she breathes. Heav'n-plighted bride! No earthly pow'r shall part us. PAGE enters. Caliph! haste, Almansor fiercely threatens— HUON. Tell him, slave! That Rezia's plighted bridegroom, face to face, Dares him in arms—(Page departs.) REZIA. Thou, whom my soul adores! Rush not on death—he bears a charmed life. HUON. Went Fate before him with the scythe of death Huon would fearless front him. EUSTACE. Look, my lord, As I did cast my setters on the flints They rattled on this rusty sword—no light one— I am no scholar, Sir, but I do feel Deep characters engraven on the blade. HUON —(takes the sword, and traces the characters.) “I'm brother to Durandal, forg'd by Fays.” Thanks, Oberon— EUSTACE. Aye, aye, no doubt, the Wood-god— HUON. Now, charms avail not—such as heav'n has form'd us, We meet in equal combat, man to man. PAGE enters. Sir Knight, Almansor speaks “bring forth the Christian, “And I will deign to look on him.” REZIA —(as Huon goes forth.) Oh Huon! Rush not on death. HUON. Eustace, protect my bride! Caliph! this arm shall fix thee on thy throne— Come forth— (Exeunt. EUSTACE. Oh do not weep so, gentle lady! Each tear you shed, seems like a drop of blood Wrung from my heart. I will not quit your side, Tho' I had rather mid the shock of arms Stand, while the clattering iron bruis'd my helm, Than hear you sigh thus—have good heart, I pray you, The Fairy is no changeling; no light worshipper Of fortune's sun-shine hour: he'll not desert him: No, nor his own right hand: 'tis Seg?in's son: And these big giants oft have pigmy souls. I've made them skip like infants—(a loud shout.) REZIA. Oh that shout! Oh Huon! my lov'd Lord— EUSTACE. The welkin rings With bursts of joy—the mountain is laid low. CALIPH enters. Haste, Rezia, haste—the Knight has rescued us. Come mid assembled Bagdad, where Almansor Bows down before the conqueror. EUSTACE. Yes, I said it. The mountain is laid low, and Seg?in's son Equals his gallant sire. (Exeunt. SCENE changes to the great Square. Huon—Almansor—Emirs—People. PEOPLE. Hail to the conqueror. ALMANSOR —(on his knee, delivering up his sword to Huon. Christian! spare my life. (Caliph, Rezia, and Eustace enter.) HUON. Kneel at the throne of Charlemaine, and say I have aveng'd my sire—(Almansor departs.) CALIPH. What earthly gift Can rightly thank thee? PEOPLE. Rezia, his reward. CALIPH. The hand of heav'n protects thee—take thy bride. (The Scene opens and discovers the Palace of the Fairies adorned with festive splendor. Oberon and Titania in bridal robes on their throne. Groups of Fairies phantastically arrayed, dancing and playing on various instruments.) They sing round Huon and Rezia. All is fulfill'd—hail, Mortals, hail! Truth, Virtue, Faith, o'er all prevail. OBERON and TITANIA —(taking the wreathes from their brows.) Fays! crown them with these wreathes that bound our brow. Fairies crown them and sing. Receive this wreath Of amaranthine flow'rs by Fairy twin'd! High meed for man assign'd— These, on earth shall o'er you breathe Bliss descending from above, When virtue graves in heav'n the vow of wedded love. OBERON —(rising from his throne, and solemnly addressing Huon. Knight! not thy fearless valor, not the sword Of charmed steel, nor tone of fairy horn, But confidence in heav'n alone preserv'd thee. The destin'd time draws near, when elfine pow'rs No more with mortal shall hold intercourse: But while the world endures, the pure in heart, They, who in time of trial, firmly stood Fixt on the base of virtue, shall draw down High succour from a source that ne'er shall fail. END OF OBERON.</field>
