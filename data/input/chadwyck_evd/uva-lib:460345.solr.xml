      <field name="fulltext">The Tragedy Of Julius CÃ¦sar, Altered With a Prologue and Chorus;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE to the Alteration of JULIUS CÃSAR. Hope to mend Shakespear! or to match his Style! 'Tis such a Jest, would make a Stoick smile. Too fond of Fame, our Poet soars too high; Yet freely owns he wants the Wings to fly: So sensible of his presumptuous Thought, That he confesses while he does the Fault: This to the Fair will no great wonder prove, Who oft in Blushes yield to what they love. Of greatest Actions, and of noblest Men, This Story most deserves a Poet's Pen. For who can wish a Scene more justly fam'd, When Rome and mighty Julius are but nam'd? That State of Heroes, who the World had brav'd! That wondrous Man, who such a State inslav'd! Yet loth he was to take so rough a way, And after govern'd with so mild a Sway, At distance now of sev'nteen hundred Years, Methinks a lovely Ravisher appears; Whom, tho' forbid by Virtue to excuse, A Nymph might pardon, and could scarce refuse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Julius CÃ¦sar, Dictator. Brutus, Conspirator. Cassius Conspirator. Dec. Brutus, Conspirator. Trebonius, Conspirator. Casca, Conspirator. M. Antonius. Junius, One of CÃ¦sar's Freedmen. Portia, Wife of Brutus. Lucius, One of his Servants. Senators. Priests. Tradesmen and Citizens. Spurinna, A Sooth-sayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This Play begins the Day before CÃ¦sar's Death, and ends within an Hour after it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter two Roman Senators at one Door, Trebonius and Casca at another. 1 SENATOR. Hail, good Trebonius. 2 SENATOR. Health to worthy Casca. Will you go with us to the Sports to day? 1 SENATOR. Before this CÃ¦sar's Time, we had no Shews Magnificent as these. TREBONIUS. But we had Triumphs: And tho' the Conqueror sate high exalted, We all partook both of his Fame and Merit: The gaz'd-on Warriour in the gilded Chariot Enjoy'd his Fill of Fame, but, as Rome's Subject: And, to his great Renown in glorious Arms, A higher, much more valu'd Crown, was added; Immortal Praise for serving well his Country. CASCA. Oh how our Hearts were fir'd at Pompey's Triumphs! The Blood more lively danc'd within our Veins: The very Image of it strikes my Fancy! Methinks I see a thousand noble Captives Drooping with Grief, which yet was lighter made By his kind Usage. After came the Treasures; Our Treasures! for it was not then as now, When one Man's greedy Gripe ingrosses all, We did not, as Law-Suitors for Contention, Disburse more Charges than the Prize was worth; Grow Beggars, only to make others rich. TREBONIUS. But then, at last, behold ev'n Captive Kings In golden Chains with pensive Thought look down, Remembring they had us'd their Subjects worse. CASCA. Yet shew'd a gloomy Comfort through their Sadness, For being vanquish'd by so brave a People. TREBONIUS. Which of us, then, oh which of us went home From such a Spectacle unmov'd with Joy, With virtuous Pride, to see our Blood well spent, Our Treasures manag'd, and our Glory rais'd? CASCA. Yet ev'n to Pompey, Chief of all our State, No Roman but disdain'd a mean Submission; A Tribute only owing to the Gods. TREBONIUS. But now we crouch, and stand in servile awe; Like Children, fear the Goblin we have made. This CÃ¦sar, tho' Dictator, is our Creature, And from Election all his Pride proceeds. CASCA. We meet these Murmurs now in ev'ry Mouth; Ill-boding Sounds to late unsettled Power, Like new-built Houses, easily blown down. TREBONIUS. Yet CÃ¦sar, still intrepidly Serene, Goes proudly on, despising us, and Danger. SCENE II. Enter a Croud of common Tradesmen. CASCA. What's all this Croud, and whither are ye going, My gazing Fellow-Citizens? To wait On your own Shame, and stare upon your Bondage? 1 TRADESMAN. I know not what you mean by Shame and Bondage: We go to see great CÃ¦sar, and the Sports. CASCA. And much good do you, Friend; You little think, The Man you so admire would be your Master. TRADESMAN. My Master! He would scorn so mean a Servant. I hope you will not jest at mighty CÃ¦sar? (Casca laughs. CASCA. I only laugh at you for loving CÃ¦sar. TRADESMAN. Oh, is that all? Well Sir, make bold with me; But have a care of medling with your Betters. CASCA. Betters! Thou sawcy Citizen, be silent. TRADESMAN. Then I am hush'd. Speak you, Sir. CASCA. What, to Fools? To Men, whose Minds are sunk in low Submission? Born free, and yet contented to be Slaves? Form'd like the dull strong Horse, to bear a Rider? Well, we may wish, and vent our Rage in Curses: May CÃ¦sarâ TRADESMAN. Hold; and hear if he speaks Treason. CASCA. May CÃ¦sar live, as long as good Men wish him! TRADESMAN. Why, what does this Man mean? he prays for CÃ¦sar. Long may he live Rome's great, and wise Dictator! TREBONIUS. Oh, my good Friends, how blind are those Desires! Did you but know how much you curse your selves, No People, sure, would be such Self-destroyers, Tho' but in Wish. Did ever Men before Pray for continuance of a Tyrant Ague That shakes their very Souls? See, how Rome trembles, And looks all pale, with Loss of guiltless Blood! Who has not lost a Kinsman, or a Friend, Whose honest Life the War has sacrific'd To this Man's wild Ambition? Nay, are not you dead too? since in his Power To kill you when he pleases? with this diff'rence; That Death, once come, frees ye from all its Force, Which every hour ye now expect with Terror. Before this fatal Time each good Man here Was Master of the World, and shar'd the Power; Kings waited on your Votes, and watch'd your Wills: But now (I weep to say how sad a Change!) The Greatness, nay the Goodness of this CÃ¦sar, Is founded on our Baseness: For, alas! What must we be, to be forgiv'n by him? And do you think, because he gives you Pleasures, Treats you with Shows, and popular Appearance, That all this seeming Softness is not Shadow? A very Trick to lull your Thoughts asleep, And then subject them? make them mild, and tame, Fit for the servile use of being Subjects? Those lofty Thoughts, which like true mettled Hawks Were us'd to fly so strong, and soar so high, Which Nature has design'd to prey on Tyrants, And not to serve them; now are whistled off With every Pageant Pomp, and gawdy Show. For shame, repent of such a childish Folly; And rather tear, like Cato, your own Bowels, Than live to see your Country torn by Tyrants. CASCA. And Pompey too, methinks, should be remember'd, Who died for you so lately; on whose Ruin This CÃ¦sar stands, and scorns us all beneath him. TREBONIUS. See if they are not mov'd; the Roman Soul Now swells within them. Go, my worthy Friends; And, if you needs will see your Tyrant's Triumph, Gaze on him then with angry envious Eyes: Be every one a Basilisk to him; Kill him with staring. 1 Citizen. Farewel worthy Lords! You love your Country, and we love you for it. TREBONIUS. Shall we not be accus'd for this? CASCA. No matter; We break no Laws either of Gods or Men: So, if we fall, it is with Reputation; A Fate which Cowards shun, and brave Men seek. If CÃ¦sar punish Men for speaking Truth, My honest Tongue shall dare his utmost Doom. But here he comes, with all that Pomp and Pride In which young Pow'r so childishly delights. SCENE III. Enter CÃ¦sar attended by Antony, Brutus, Cassius, and many other Senators: Sits down in a magnificent Seat to behold several Divertisements after the Roman manner: When the Sports are ended, Antony presents him a Crown. ANTONIUS. Hail, mighty Man! thou Godlike CÃ¦sar, hail! Stoop to our Wishes, and vouchsafe to wear This Crown, presented thee by all Mankind: Shine on us, like the Sun, in your full Lustre; While Rome reviv'd lies basking in your Beams, And flourishes beneath that kindly Heat. Adorn us with your Pow'r, and make us proud Of being Subjects to so great a King. CÃSAR. I am not call'd your King, but your Dictator: (CÃ¦sar descends from his Seat to the middle of the Stage. A Name, I hope, that bears as great a Sound; If not, 'tis no vain Titles that can help it: Therefore I both refuse, and slight a Crown, (He puts back the Crown with his Hand, at which the People shout for Joy. Which can add nothing to my Power, or Rome's. I'm glad, my Friends, you are so easily pleas'd With my refusing what I think below me; Were it above me, I should quickly reach it. Your Kings, it seems, exerted Power so ill, That you expell'd the hated Name for ever. But 'tis the Tyranny, not Name, ye fear; And that my Soul abhors, as much as you. Witness, ye Gods, I have no other Aim Than to advance your Good, and my own Honour ANTONIUS. Take then this Crown, which seems so much for both; (Offering the Crown once more. For Pow'r well plac'd, can never be too great. CÃSAR. Again! this needs not; 'tis unseemly Joy; (CÃ¦sar refuses it, and they shout a second time. It looks as if you doubted me before, And are surpriz'd to find my Moderation. ANTONIUS. 'Tis I, Sir, am surpriz'd; but 'tis with Grief, (He offers the Crown the third time. To see you shun a Pow'r, you ought to seek; At least, reject it not with such Irreverence; Crowns are the fairest Presents of the Gods. CÃSAR. Again! (He refuses it again, and they shout the third time. Peace, you unmannerly, unthinking Crowd! Are you so pleas'd? and have I no way left But this, to be as popular as Pompey? How have I us'd my Pow'r, that you should fear it? Then, to be more secure, here take my Life; I freely offer it to every Roman. Let out that Blood, you think boils with Ambition, I'd rather lose it, than out-live my Fame; Nor would accept of Pow'r, unless to please. I feel their Pulses, and I find them beat (To Antony aside. Fev'rish, and high, unfit for my Designs: Their Reason lost, they rave for Liberty, Like Lunaticks, confin'd for their own good, Strive for a fatal Freedom to be ruin'd. ANTONIUS. Therefore in pity, Sir, restrain them more. CÃSAR. I'll guard them from themselves, their own worst Foes; And will have Pow'r to do whate'er I please; Yet bear my Thunder in a gentle Hand. Like Jove, I'll sit above; but 'tis to show My Love and Care of all the World below. Enter a Messenger. MESSENGER. Some other Sports are in the Field of Mars, And only wait your Presence. CÃSAR. Let us go. The Ev'ning is far spent, it will be dark; And I, thou know'st, have not been well to day. (To Brutus. Exeunt CÃ¦sar, and Antony. SCENE IV. CASSIUS. Will you not wait on CÃ¦sar to the Course? BRUTUS. Not I. CASSIUS. How so? BRUTUS. I am not fit for Sports; I want the airy Humour of Marc Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your Desires. CASSIUS. Brutus, I have observ'd you much of late; I have not from your Eyes that Gentleness And Show of Love, which I was us'd to find: Pardon my Cares, that only come from Kindness; Your Carriage is a little too reserv'd, And strange, to Friends who would be more familiar. BRUTUS. Cassius, mistake me not, if I have veil'd My Look, I turn the trouble of my Countenance Meerly upon my self: I am of late Troubled with Passions of a diff'rent nature, Conceptions only proper to my self, Which gives perhaps some Soil to my Behaviour. But let not therefore my good Friends complain, (Amongst which number Cassius is the chief) Nor misinterpret farther my Neglect; But think poor Brutus, with himself at War, Forgets the Shows of Love to other Men. CASSIUS. I am most glad to find I was mistaken. That Error made this Breast of mine conceal Thoughts of great Value, worthy of your Ear: Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your Face? BRUTUS. No, Cassius; for, the Eye sees not it self, But by Reflexion from some other thing. CASSIUS. 'Tis just: Then know, 'tis much lamented Brutus, That you have no such Mirror as might show (Spite of your Modesty your own hid Worth;) That you for once might see the noble Shadow. I have heard some, of the best Rank in Rome (Except immortal CÃ¦sar) talk of Brutus; And groaning underneath this Age's Yoke, Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his Eyes. BRUTUS. Into what Dangers wou'd you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me look into my self For that which is not in me? CASSIUS. Brutus, hear: And since, you know, you cannot see your self So well as by Reflexion; I, your Glass, Will without all Disguise discover now That of your self, which yet you know not of. And be not jealous of me, gentle Brutus. Were I some slight Buffoon, or us'd to flatter, To cloy each Man I meet with proffer'd Love, And then betray him; did I use to fawn And hug Men hard, then crush them with my Scandal; Or if you ever knew me riotous To loss of Reason; then you might suspect me. What Shouts are these? (A great Shout. BRUTUS. I hope, like those just now, For Joy, that CÃ¦sar has refus'd the Crown. CASSIUS. If you hope that, you would not have him King. BRUTUS. I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well. CASSIUS. And do you think he would forgive that Wish, Or would accept your Love, with that Allay? BRUTUS. If just, he will; and, if unjust, I care not. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? I see you labour with some weighty thing. If it be towards the gen'ral Good, speak quickly; I am in haste to meet your noble Thoughts. Set Virtue in my Eye, and let grim Death Shake his unheeded Dart, I'll still be fix'd. For, may the Gods so help me, as, for Honour, I look indiff'rently on Life or Death. CASSIUS. I know your Virtue, Brutus, and dare trust it. Well, Honour is the Subject of my Story. I cannot tell what you and other Men Think of this Life; but for my single self, I'll chuse much rather not to live at all, Than live to be in awe of any thing. I was born free as CÃ¦sar; so are you; We both are bred as well; and we can both Endure the Winter's Cold as well as he. For, once upon a raw and gusty Day, The troubled Tiber turn'd into a Foam, CÃ¦sar says to me, Cassius, darst thou now Leap in with me into this angry Flood, And swim to yonder Point? Upon the word, Accoutred as I was, I plung'd me in, And bade him follow; so indeed he did: The Torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it, With lusty Sinews throwing it aside, But yet, e'er we could reach the Point propos'd, CÃ¦sar cry'd, help me, Cassius, or I sink! Just as Ãneas, our great Ancestor, Did from the Flames of Troy bear on his Shoulders The old Anchises, I, from Tiber's Waves Bore the tir'd CÃ¦sar; Yet this feeble Man Is now become a God; and Cassius is A wretched Creature, and must bend his Body, If CÃ¦sar give him but a careless Nod. A strange Disease possesses him sometimes, This Day I saw him fall into his Fit; (That which delay'd the Sports till Afternoon.) This God has fall'n to ground, and foam'd at mouth, His Limbs have trembled, and his Eyes have roll'd, Yet now his Look must awe the trembling World. Nay, I have heard him groan, like a sick Girl; And that smooth Tongue which us'd to move so much, And make the Romans set down all it said, Would faulter then, and stammer out strange things. Gods! why should one of such a feeble Temper Be set upon the Top of all this World, To look down on Mankind? (A Shout. BRUTUS. Another Shout! sure Rome is turn'd a Revel! (Another Shout. I fear at least they crown him with Applause. CASSIUS. Why, Man, he now bestrides the narrow World, Like a Colossus; and we petty Men Walk under his huge Legs, and peep about, To find our selves dishonourable Graves. Men, at some times, are Masters of their Fates; The Fault, dear Brutus, is not in our Stars, But in our selves, that we are Underlings. Brutus, and CÃ¦sar! where's the difference? Why should that Name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a Name; Shout Brutus, and the Echo is as loud: Brutus and CÃ¦sar! conjure with those Names, Brutus will start a Spirit, as soon as CÃ¦sar. Now in the Name of all the Gods at once, On what high Fame does this our CÃ¦sar feed, That he is grown so great? Age, thou art sham'd! Rome, thou hast lost thy Breed of noble Blood! When did there pass an Age, since Time first was, That the whole World resounded but one Man? When could they say, till now, who talk'd of Rome, That her wide Walls contain'd one single Heroe? O, you and I have heard our Fathers say, There was a Brutus once, who kill'd his Sons, And would have slain his dearest Friend, nay Father, Rather than suffer Rome to be enslav'd. BRUTUS. That Cassius loves me, I am nothing jealous; What you would work me to, I have some Aim; How I have thought of this, and of these Times, I shall recount hereafter; for this present, I would not (if with Love I might intreat it) Be any farther mov'd. What you have said, I will consider; what you have to say, I will with Patience bear, and find a time Both fit to hear, and answer such high things. Till then, my noble Friend, remember this; Brutus had rather be a Villager, A worthless Stranger, than a Son of Rome, Under such hard Conditions as this Time Is like to lay upon us. CASSIUS. I am happy, That my weak Words have drawn thus much from Brutus. BRUTUS. A suddain Storm! I'll leave you, noble Cassius; (Excessive Thunder and Lightning, on a suddain. We are observ'd. At Midnight, if you please, We'll meet again, and talk of this more largely. CASSIUS. I will not fail to wait on worthy Brutus. (Exit Brutus. SCENE V. Enter Casca to Cassius. CASSIUS. Who's there? CASCA. A Roman. CASSIUS. Casca, by your Voice. CASCA. Your Ear is good. The Air is strangely chang'd! CASSIUS. A very harmless Air to honest Men. CASCA. Who ever knew the Heavens threaten so? CASSIUS. Who ever knew the Earth so full of Faults? For my part, I'll walk still about the Streets, Submitting to the Dangers of the Storm; Unbutton'd thus, and careless, as you see, Will bare my Bosom to the Thunderbolt, Just as the fiery Flash begins to dart. CASCA. But wherefore would you so much tempt the Gods? Sure, 'tis our part rather to fear, and tremble, When they, for Causes to poor Men unknown, Send dreadful Heraulds to denounce a War. CASSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those Sparks of Fire That should inflame a Roman Breast, you want, Or else dissemble: You look pale, and gaze, And put on Fear, and lose your self in Wonder, To see this strange Disorder in the Heavens: Think on the Earth, good Casca; think on Rome; If fiery Meteors, and Fool-frighting Ghosts, If monstrous Births, and strange portentous things, As you believe, break Nature's settled Course; 'Tis to accompany this monstrous State. I could now, Casca, name to thee a Man Most like this dreadful Night, which Thunders, Lightens, Tears open Graves, and keeps us all in Terror: A Man no mightier than thy self, or me, In real Might, in Worth; yet grown a Giant; And every Roman else seems but a Pigmy. CASCA. It is not hard to guess the Man you mean. CASSIUS. No matter for his Name; for Romans now Have Limbs, and Sinews, like their Ancestors; But where the Minds of all our famous Fathers? Dead, dead with them! we have our Mother's Spirits; 'Tis Womanish to see, and suffer this. CASCA. Indeed, they say, the Senators to morrow Mean to establish CÃ¦sar for their King; And he shall wear his Crown by Sea, and Land, In every Place, but here in Italy. CASSIUS. I know where I shall wear this Dagger then. Cassius from Bondage will deliver Cassius. Herein the poor are rich, the weak most strong; By this, the wretched mock at base Oppression; The meanest are victorious o'er the mighty. Not Tow'rs of Stone, nor Walls of harden'd Brass, Nor airless Dungeons, the poor Strength of Tyrants, Not all their strongest Guards, nor heaviest Chains, Can in the least controul the mighty Spirit. For, noble Life, when weary of it self, Has always Power to shake it off, at pleasure. Since I know this, know all the World besides, That part of Tyranny prepar'd for me, I can and will defy. CASCA. And so can I. Thus ev'ry Bondman in his own Hand bears The Pow'r to cancel his Captivity. CASSIUS. And why should CÃ¦sar be a Tyrant then? Poor Man! I know he would not be a Wolf, But that he sees the Romans are but Sheep: He were no Lion, if we were not Lambs. But oh, disorder'd Grief, where hast thou led me! I speak, perhaps, before a willing Bondman, One whom tame Fools miscall a mod'rate Man; That is, a mean Complyer with the Times. But I am arm'd within against all Danger. CASCA. Cassius, you speak to Casca, to a Man Whose Thoughts have all this while out-gone your Words; Here take my Hand, and make what use of it The Times and our Necessities require; I am resolv'd. CASSIUS. Then, there's a Bargain made. Now know, good Casca, I have mov'd already Some of the boldest noblest-minded Romans To undertake with me an Enterprize Of honourable, dang'rous Consequence. They now all stay for me in Pompey's Porch, (And such a Night as this requires a Shelter) A Night, that's like the noble Work in hand, All black, and terrible! but soft; stand close. Enter Trebonius. CASCA. Trebonius, now I know him by his Gait. CASSIUS. He is a Friend; pray hold, whither so fast? TREBONIUS. To look out you. Who's that, Metellus Cimber? CASSIUS. No, 'tis our Casca, one as bold, and honest; Am I not stay'd for? TREBONIUS. What a Night is this! There's two or three of us have seen strange Sights! CASSIUS. Well, let 'em see them. Tell me, am I staid for? TREBONIUS. You are. O Cassius, if you could prevail with Brutus; He, as a Band, would tye our Party strong. CASCA. Why is not Brutus one? I thought him sure. CASSIUS. Be you content. Trebonius, take this Scrole, And look you lay it in the ready way, Where Brutus needs must find it; then, throw this In at his Window; set this up with Wax Upon old Brutus's Statue: all this done, Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us. Is Decius Brutus, and Marullus there? TREBONIUS. All, all are there, except Metellus Cimber; And he is gone to seek you at your House. CASSIUS. Away then; lose no time: Come, my good Casca, We will go visit Brutus yet e're Day: Three Parts of that good Man are ours already, And, on the next Assault, he yields entire. CASCA. Oh, he sits high in all the People's Hearts. CASSIUS. So, that which would appear Offence in us, His Countenance, like the great Art of Chymists, Will change to Virtue, and to noble Deeds. CASCA. Him and his Worth, and our great need of him, You have consider'd well. Come let's make haste. CASSIUS. The Sun that sees him next, shall find him ours. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Instead of the Musick usually play'd between the Acts, the following Verses are, after this Act, to be sung by a Chorus representing the Roman People. First CHORUS. I. Whither is Roman Honour gone? Where is our ancient Virtue now? That Valour, which so bright has shone, And with the Wings of Conquest flown, Must to a haughty Master bow: Who, with our Toil, our Blood, and all we have beside, Gorges his ill-got Pow'r, his Humour, and his Pride. II. Fearless he will his Life expose; So does a Lion, or a Bear; His very Virtues threaten those, Who more his bold Ambition fear. How stupid Wretches we appear, Who round the World for Wealth and Empire roam; Yet never, never think what Slaves we are at home! III. Did Men, for this, together join; Quitting the free wild Life of Nature? What other Beast did e're design The setting up his Fellow Creature? And of two Mischiefs chuse the greater? Oh, rather than be Slaves to bold imperious Men, Give us our Wildness, and our Woods, our Hutts, and Caves agen. IV. There secure from lawless Sway, Out of Pride, or Envy's way; Living up to Nature's Rules, Not deprav'd by Knaves and Fools; Happily we all should live, and harmless as our Sheep, And at last as calmly die, as Infants fall asleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Brutus alone in his House undrest. He would be King; nay will be, if he lives; This most important Day disclos'd that Secret: Ambition, like a mad tempestuous Sea, Swell'd him above the Bounds of wise dissembling. And ended all our Hopes of future Freedom. Justice, and Liberty! Farewell for ever! If Brutus is thus sensible of Slav'ry, I, who am CÃ¦sar's Friend, and partial for him; What is it then to others? to those thousands Who must lye heap'd in Dust, to raise him higher? But my own Words reproach me; can I call My self his Friend, and yet consent to kill him? By Heav'n, no less than plain Ingratitude! That heavy Load presses my tender mind; I cannot bear it. Nay, this CÃ¦sar also Is humbly brave, and gentle in his Greatness; Apt for Converse, and easy of Access; Skill'd in all Arts, matchless in Eloquence; In War and Business indefatigable. Bounteous as Nature, merciful as Heav'n; In all, sublime, high, and unparallel'd. Yet oft Humility is but the Ladder, By which th' ambitious Climber gets so high; But, when he once attains the upmost Round, Then straight he throws the useless Engine down, Looks in the Clouds, and scorns the low degrees By which he did ascend. Then Rome is lost! But is there no way left us, but his Death? What, kill the best, and bravest of Mankind, Only for Jealousy? Of being Slaves. Oh dismal Sound! Who can dread that too much? The fear of Slavery is Fortitude. And, to advise him? No, 'tis easier To kill a Tyrant amidst all his Guards, Than give him Counsel for his Country's Good. This CÃ¦sar's Prudence may a while restrain him; But if Ambition once transports his Mind, Down sink at once all thoughts of Right, or Reason. Goodness of Nature makes some struggle in him; But even that Goodness will incline to think, Rome shall be happier, when himself is higher. Lucius awake; what hoa! why Lucius! I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly. Lucius, awake, awake; LUCIUS. Call you my Lord? BRUTUS. Get me a Taper in my Study, Boy; Then, come and call me strait. (Exit Lucius; Re-enters immediately. LUCIUS. Here is a Scroll Newly thrown in at Window fast seal'd up. BRUTUS. Give it me, Boy, and haste to light the Taper. (Exit Lucius. 'Tis not yet Day, but such a fiery Night, That I may make a shift to read this Parchment. âBrutus, awake; for Rome has lost her Rest, (Reads. âAnd takes it ill that thou shouldst sleep so soundly: âAwake, and strike!âThere was a Brutus onceâ âAnd TarquinâHa, thus I must piece it out; There was a Brutus who redeem'd his Country, And did what now we all expect from thee. âShall Romeâ'Tis dark, but sure it must be thus. (Reads. âShall Rome, the Mistress of the prostrate World, âBe ravish'd by a Tyrant? Brutus, strike. O Rome! and dost thou call upon thy Brutus? Am I thought worthy of thy choice? 'Tis done: Thou shalt not wait for aid that I can bring thee. Enter Lucius again. LUCIUS. Some body knocks at Gate, Sir, shall I open? BRUTUS. See, who 'tis first; go Boy, and bring me word. (Exit Lucius. Would it were over once; I cannot rest: In such a Plot there is no Peace of Mind: The harshness of this Deed would sink my Spirits, Did not assisting Justice hold me up. Enter Lucius with a Taper. LUCIUS. 'Tis Cassius, my Lord. BRUTUS. Is he alone? LUCIUS. No, but I could not well perceive the rest, Their Faces are so muffled in their Robes. BRUTUS. Let them come in. They are the Faction! SCENE II. Enter Cassius and the rest of the Conspirators muffled in their Robes. BRUTUS. Welcome, good Brother Cassius: welcome all. CASSIUS. Welcome the hour that brings us thus together. BRUTUS. Know I these Men? CASSIUS. You know them, and their Hearts, Which are all set upon the Noble Brutus. This is Trebonius; this Decius Brutus, This Cinna, Casca, and Metellus Cimber: Your Friends, and Followers, all. BRUTUS. They are most welcome. CASSIUS. Brutus, a word. (They whisper. CASCA. If Brutus will but join, Our Fabrick's firm, and nothing then can shake it: He is the Cement that must hold us fast. BRUTUS. Well, noble Lords, I am at last resolv'd; Ev'n against Friendship Justice has prevail'd. Give me your resolute Hands. CASSIUS. And let us swear. BRUTUS. No Oath: the Cause already is so sacred, There is no need of Oaths to make it more: If sense of Slavery, and noble Shame, If Thirst of honest Fame in after Ages, If glorious Justice cannot move our Souls, They are too weak for such a Deed as this; Break off betimes, and every Roman here Retire with Blushes to his idle Bed; And then let Tyranny for ever range, Till each Man falls unpity'd: but if these, (As who dares make a doubt) are noble Romans; What needs a Tye among us but our Words? Plain Honesty to Honesty engag'd, That CÃ¦sar shall not live to laugh at Cowards. Let Priests, and Women swear, and feeble Minds, Which, wav'ring still, need such a Childish check: We are above such helps, and steady bear Our even Souls, without one doubtful start. What Roman dares be base in such a business? Reckon his Guilt, and Shame, he ventures more Than if he did attempt ten Thousand Tyrants. CASSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him? His Gravity will countenance our Heat. TREBONIUS. No need of that, now Brutus is engag'd. BRUTUS. I know him well, believe him just and wise; Yet Vanity a little clouds his Virtue: Nor is he bold enough for such a Business. The Horse that starts, however good besides, In War is troublesome, nay dangerous. DECIUS BRUTUS. But Antony, so well belov'd by CÃ¦sar, That Instrument of all his Tyranny, If he survive, will be another CÃ¦sar. TREBONIUS. Decius, well urg'd; Antonius must dye. BRUTUS. O, by no means, our course will seem too bloody, To cut the Head off, and then hack the Limbs: 'Twill look like Anger, nay like Envy too; For, Antony is great by CÃ¦sar's Favour; Let us be Sacrificers, but not Butchers. We only draw our Swords against Ambition; Not against CÃ¦sar's Person, but his Power: Oh that we, then, could come at CÃ¦sar's Spirit, Abate his Pride, and yet not spill his Blood! (Sighs. It cannot be; CÃ¦sar alas must bleed. Yet, gentle Friends! Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully; Let's serve him up, a Dish fit for the Gods; Not mangled, as a Feast to Beasts of Prey. Our Hearts should melt, like those of tender Parents, Who oft in sharp, but necessary Rage, Correct offending Children with Remorse, Feeling more pain than what they make them suffer. This Mercy too looks better to the World. Which shall not call us Murderers, but Heroes. As for Antonius therefore, think not of him; For he can do no more, than CÃ¦sar's Arm, When CÃ¦sar's Head is off. TREBONIUS. But yet I fear him: For he loves CÃ¦sar, and is most audacious. BRUTUS. I hope that loving CÃ¦sar is no Fault; Else I confess that I am guilty too: If he loves CÃ¦sar, all that he can do Is to be griev'd, and pine away for CÃ¦sar: And it were strange he should; for he is given Too much to Wildness, Company, and Pleasures. CASSIUS. There is no fear of him; let him not dye; For he will live and laugh at this hereafter. DECIMUS BRUTUS. But hold, how late's the Night? BRUTUS. 'Tis five, at least. CASSIUS. O how I long to welcome the Eighth Hour, The wish'd Alarm to our great purposes! DECIMUS BRUTUS. 'Tis time to part, least at our several Homes We should be miss'd too long. CASSIUS. But what if CÃ¦sar Should forbear coming to the Capitol? The unaccustom'd Terror of this Night May move the Augurs to forbid his going: And, tho' himself's above such idle Fears, Yet the most wise and brave must yield to Custom. DECIMUS BRUTUS. Never doubt that: And tho' he were resolved, I can o'er-sway him; for he loves to hear me. Prudence, tho' much superior, often yields To subtle Mirth, and sly Insinuation. If CÃ¦sar stay at home because it thunders, I can in jest reproach him with his fear; He'll laugh, yet fear he shall be thought afraid. BRUTUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him. But see, 'tis almost Day; some light appears. CASSIUS. Then let us be dispers'd, like foggy Clouds, To meet again in Thunder. BRUTUS. Friends, farewell. Only remember that we all are Romans; That thought will keep up our exalted Spirits Exeunt Conspirators, Manet Brutus. SCENE III. Enter Portia undress'd, as new risen from Bed. PORTIA. Brutus! my Lord, where are you? BRUTUS. What, my Portia? Why do you thus expose your tender health? PORTIA. Can I consider Health, without your Love? You have unkindly stol'n from me to Night, And by your Absence robb'd me of my Rest: How could my Brutus thus ungently leave One so unwilling to be left by you? BRUTUS. Chide not too much, my Portia; and yet There is some pleasure to be chid so kindly. Our Sex has tenderness equal to yours; Yet we, incumbred with vexatious Cares, No sooner bend our softer Thoughts to Love, But Business, like a Master too severe, Stands hov'ring over us amidst our Pleasure, And drags us to our tiresome Task again. PORTIA. But Life is short; O why should we mispend it? A Wretch condemn'd to dye within few hours, Would think them ill employ'd in Complements: The solemn Trifles of a busy World Are oft but Complement, compar'd with Love, Whose short and precious hours you throw away. BRUTUS. Dear Portia, now you but disturb my Thoughts. PORTIA. Can mine be easy then? 'tis no small thing Can vex your even Mind, and make you froward, Froward with me, which you was ne'er till now: This Night I folded you within these Arms, And ask'd you if you slept, if you were well? You said, you could not sleep, and yet turn'd from me. BRUTUS. Turning from thee is Restlesness indeed; Thou only Comfort to my troubled Mind! May Joys, and full Content remain in yours. PORTIA. Oh, preach Content to one upon a Rack, And he will hear as soon. My Soul is so perplex'd with Fears for you, That all the Joys of Nature, or of Fortune, Could find no entrance here at such a time. BRUTUS. Retire, retire; talking so tenderly, You, like officious and condoling Friends, But more afflict that Mind you would compose. I hope you think me neither false nor foolish; If it were fit for you to know my Cares, 'Twere ill in me to let you ask me twice: Let that suffice, and leave me; 'tis a word, I never us'd to thee before. PORTIA. Alas! You would not use it now, if still you lov'd. Can you have thoughts unfit to own to me? You are unjust, and I undone, farewel. BRUTUS. What means my Portia? PORTIA. Brutus unjust! Oh, 'tis a Wonder, which your very Foes Would not believe, tho' told it by your Friends: And to me too, who had least cause to fear it! So little I deserv'd to find him so. Am I but only Partner of your Pleasures? Fit for your trifling Hours, and to be kept At hateful distance from your nobler Thoughts? What is it I have innocently done, To lose that Trust, which always follows Kindness. And therefore yours is chang'd; I see it plainly: Thunder is fall'n on my poor guiltless Head, (Weeps. And all but I, perhaps, have heard the Blow. BRUTUS. In this you wrong me Portia. PORTIA. Would I did: I never wish'd a Wrong to you before. BRUTUS How have I liv'd, and which of all my Actions Has giv'n the least occasion ev'n for Malice? I am, you know, not like the rest of Husbands; My Promise and my Vows are Tyes to me, As strong as Fame and Virtue are to you: I will not mention now the Bands of Love, In which I thought we were for ever fix'd. What these unjust Suspicions may produce Either in you or me, alas, I know not. Therefore be calm and kind, as thou art us'd, And try such rough ungentle ways no more. My Mind, you know, hardens against Compulsion, But easily bends under gentle Usage. PORTIA. O let me now try that soft way again. Thus low, thus tenderly, I beg to know (Falls on his Neck. That which, in troubling you, ev'n tortures me. Shunn'd as I am, I have a share in all Your Resolutions, spite of your Unkindness. You cannot shut me out from tender cares For every thought of yours: that zealous part The meanest Slave may have in mighty CÃ¦sar, And yet give no offence. BRUTUS. The mighty CÃ¦sar! I am that meanest Slave, if he remain (Apart. The mighty CÃ¦sar. Kneel not, gentle Portia. PORTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus. (Weeps. BRUTUS. O my soft Heart! my Resolution's arm'd Against all Dangers, nay, against my Friend; Yet firm to all things else, it yields to Love; (Takes her in his Arms. It yields to Portia. You are now too charming. For pity hide your Kindness, or your Beauty; There's no resisting both. PORTIA. 'Tis Kindness only Which makes me wish I had that Beauty too But are you, then, not angry? BRUTUS. What, with thee? The most obdurate Creature, ev'n a Tyrant, In all his height of Anger, and of Pride, Could not be proof against one Tear of thine. (Kisses her. O Portia, be not you that Tyrant then; For well you know your Pow'r, and may be mine. PORTIA. But tell me all. BRUTUS. Then, know that they who came to me this Nightâ But why shou'd I go on to thee, my Portia, In any Language but in that of Love? Tis to profane thy Ear, to entertain it With any harsher sound; spare then thy self. PORTIA. But you were just about to let me know. BRUTUS. Know what? know things that will but trouble thee? Believe me, Portia, 'tis dangerous For thee to tread in these obscurer Paths; Serpents lye hidden there, whose conscious Sting Will rob thee of thy rest. Oh, press not thus to bear a part in that, Which with its weight will crush thy tender Mind. PORTIA. I am a Woman, but am Cato's Daughter. My Heart is tender, but to Brutus only. Think you 'tis nothing, to have such a Father, And such a Husband? BRUTUS. Well then, hear it all. PORTIA. Hold, dearest Brutus! I dare not hear it yet; I'll try this first. She stabs her self in the Arm. BRUTUS. Hold, what d'ye mean? PORTIA. To try my Fortitude. For tho' I durst have trusted my firm Mind With any thing which but concern'd my self; Where you're engag'd, it was too great a venture: I doubt my firmest thoughts, while you suspect them. BRUTUS. Oh, Wonder of thy Sex! Gods! make me worthy of this matchless Woman! Haste, haste, and let thy Wound be quickly dress'd. Within I'll tell thee all, And in thy Bosom pour my very Soul. Exit Porcia. Enter Lucius. LUCIUS. A Messenger, my Lord, from mighty CÃ¦sar Is sent to summon you, and Caius Cassius, About some weighty matter presently. (Exit Lucius. BRUTUS. From CÃ¦sar? and my Brother Cassius too? An early Summons this! We are betray'd, Lost and undone, yet less in our own ruin, Than in the letting him escape. Oh Rome, Thou hast in vain depended on thy Brutus! But I will go, lest my delaying now Should raise Suspicion; and if all's discover'd, My Life is useless, and not worth my Care. (Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Between the second and third Act, these Verses are to be sung by a Person representing the Genius of Rome. Second CHORUS. Lo, to prevent this mighty Empire's Doom, From bright unknown Abodes of Bliss I come, The awful Genius of Majestick Rome. Great is her Danger: but I will engage Some few, the Master-Souls of all this Age, To do an Act of just Heroic Rage. 'Tis hard, a Man so great, should fall so low; More hard, to let so brave a People bow To one themselves have rais'd, who scorns them now. Yet oh, I grieve, that Brutus should be stain'd; Whose Life, excepting this one Act, remain'd So pure, that future times will think it feign'd. But only he can make the rest combine; The very Life, and Soul of their Design; The Centre, where those mighty Spirits join. Unthinking Men no sort of Scruples make; Others do ill, only for Mischief's sake; But ev'n the best are guilty by Mistake. Thus some, for Envy, or Revenge, intend To bring the bold Usurper to his end; But for his Country, Brutus stabs his Friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Scene is CÃ¦sar's Apartment, where he appears Undress'd. CÃSAR. Ambition, Oh thou Tyrant of my Soul! How much a gentler Lord am I to Rome, Than thou to me! I am the only Slave. This Day was dully spent in publick Sports, Things too magnificent for true Delight. Joy dwells in silent Shades, and private Pleasures; In Peace, and not in Pomp: then, my long Nights, Those precious Hours design'd for soft Repose, Are by unruly Cares thus ravish'd from me. Enter Junius. JUNIUS. Brutus and Cassius attend your Pleasure. CÃSAR. I tell thee, Junius, my trusty Freed-man, That melancholic Cassius needs observing. If e'er I could be capable of Fear, I think it would be of that pensive Cassius. He loves not Learning, no not Poetry; Nor is his sullen humour pleas'd with Musick. When others laugh, he so demurely smiles As if he thought it Meanness to be merry Seldom he likes what others most approve, And loves to praise what all men else dislike. Such Men as he are never at their Ease, While they behold a greater than themselves. Yet he is brave, and shall have due Preferment. Exit Junius. SCENE II. Enter Brutus and Cassius. CÃSAR. You seem amaz'd at such an early Summons; I have not slept all Night. CASSIUS. On what account? CÃSAR. 'Tis only what I suffer from my Cares. But my unquiet Mind should not disturb Such noble Romans, had you not been both Nearly concern'd in what I have to say. CASSIUS. We are betray'd. (Softly. BRUTUS. No matter; let us not Betray our selves by want of Resolution. (Softly. CÃSAR. The two great vacant Offices of PrÃ¦tors, (On which ev'n neighb'ring Princes look with Envy) Shall now be fill'd by two the greatest Romans. I owe the Commonwealth that Care, to find Who best deserves her Favour or her Frown. CASSIUS. We neither beg for one, nor fear the other. CÃSAR. Cassius, I know your Soul is void of Fear. And above grudging at your Brother's Greatness. CASSIUS. I understand no Oracles; but sure Brutus and I are Friends, as well as Brothers. CÃSAR. And therefore you will be the more contented, If I advance him ev'n above your self; Desert like his can never rise too high. I know no pleasure equal to obliging Transcendent Merit in an humble Mind. Such modest Worth should get the Prize from Courtship Yet this may only be my Love's mistake; For, I confess my Weakness, I am frail (Embracing Brutus. Like other Men, and partial for a Friend; Yet that's a fault Heav'n easily forgives. Be thou, my best lov'd Brutus, Chief of PrÃ¦tors: And, Cassius may accept the second Place, (To Cassius. Not only in the State, but my Affection. No thanks; a Coin not counted among Friends. (Exit CÃ¦sar. SCENE III. CASSIUS. 'Tis well it proves no worse. BRUTUS. What worse can be? CASSIUS. Sure, Brutus has no reason to complain. BRUTUS. Yes, of you, Cassius; if you can believe I would receive a Favour from a Foe. Is this a time to be oblig'd by CÃ¦sar? Good Gods! had I not doubts enough before? Did I not struggle hard enough for Virtue? That this last Tenderness of his is added To shake my very Soul? The strong impression May break my Heart, but shall not bend my Mind. Cassius in this is honour'd more than Brutus; For, when our Country is so much debased, Repulse is glorious; and Advancement Shame: I'll not be rais'd by him who ruins her. It was no private Injury provok'd me; Frowns had not frighten'd me, nor shall his Favours With all their Syren Voice entice me to him. I must go on through Virtue's plainest course; In that smooth Path there is no fear of falling. SCENE IV. Enter the Conspirators, and other Senators. CASSIUS. See if our Friends are not already come. Tis later than we thought. You are well met. CINNA. Is CÃ¦sar stirring yet? CASSIUS. Just now gone in; And will, when drest, immediately come forth. Fear nothing, all's secure. SCENE V. Enter CÃ¦sar again, dress'd. CÃSAR. Welcome, my Friends. DECIMUS BRUTUS. The Senate does attend great CÃ¦sar's Presence; And we are come to wait upon you thither. CÃSAR. Let 'em attend a while, 'tis early yet. SCENE VI. Enter Antony. [CÃSAR] What, Antony, who revels all the Night, Is he up too? Nay, then 'tis time to go. ANTONY. Rather to stay: I came not here in Courtship. But 'tis the sacred College of the Priests Which brought me hither; and they wait without. Hear 'em, Great CÃ¦sar; it concerns you nearly, And what does so is for the Good of Rome. CÃSAR. The Senate stays, another time will serve. (As he is going out, enter the Priests who stop him. PRIEST. Great CÃ¦sar, hail! Forgive our zealous haste, Urg'd by Divine Portent which sent us here, To warn the mighty Ruler of the World. CÃSAR. Speak: I attend the Message of the Gods. PRIEST. As on Mount Aventine I lately sate, Attir'd with sacred Robes, and Southward turn'd; The Heav'ns all clear, and free from black Presage: With my bent Wand I the due Rites perform'd, And parted all the Regions of the Air. When lo, ill-boding Birds appear'd from far, Bearing Misfortunes on their ominous Wings: I gaz'd upon them with Prophetick skill, Till a fierce flash of Lightning check'd my Sight. Then, in one instant, all the Heav'ns were chang'd; Clouds, swell'd with Thunder, rowl'd themselves along, With noise too horrible for humane Ear. CÃSAR. It thunder'd, and it lighten'd: well, go on. SECOND PRIEST. Omens of ill in several kinds agree: Having new chose for solemn Sacrifice A large-grown Bull, the goodliest of the Herd; With an unwonted Rage he breaks his Chains, Making fierce way through all the frighten'd Crowd, Which gaz'd, and trembled; so divided stood Betwixt their Curiosity and Fear: At last, he at the Altar laid him down, And seem'd to beg the Blow, which none durst give; Then on a sudden shook the Air like Thunder; And with unheard of Bellowing breath'd his last. When open'd, we beheld with Eyes amaz'd This boist'rous Beast that rag'd with so much clamour, Yet had no Heart. CÃSAR. And I should seem like him, Did I give way to every idle Fear. PRIEST. Is it an idle thing to fear the Gods? Thou 'rt in their Power, as the World in thine; And each may own a Fear without a Blush. ANTONY. Good CÃ¦sar be advis'd: in this one thing Yield to your Friends, and send the Senate word You are not well. CÃSAR. What, send 'em an Excuse? Have I in Conquest stretch'd my Arm so far, And fear at last to tell Grey-beards the Truth? No, Antony, Truth will bear out it self. I would do much to give my Friends Content; So, let them know I shall not come to day; Cannot, is false, and, that I dare not, falser. I will not come: Go tell it to the Senate. (To Decius Brutus. DECIUS BRUTUS. But shall not I pretend some Cause for this? CÃSAR. The Cause is in my Will. I will not go. That is enough to satisfy the Senate. DECIUS BRUTUS. Sir, I obey; but pardon my Affection, If it offends you with untimely Care: The Senate is resolv'd to give a Crown This day to mighty CÃ¦sar: Who can tell, But by to morrow their loose Minds may change? Assemblies are uncertain as the Sea, Which ebbs and flows, now rises, and now falls, Just as the hum'rous Wind inclines to move. No Woman changes more than Crowds of Men. CÃSAR. How weak your Fears seem now, good Antony! I must not let the fair occasion fall. Prepare the Ceremony, I am stay'd for. BRUTUS. Prudence in vain defends unhappy Men: When Heav'n ordains, the Wisest haste to Ruin. (Exeunt Omnes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To be sung after the Third Act, by two Aerial Spirits. Third CHORUS I. Tell, oh tell me, whence arise These Disorders in our Skies? Rome's great Genius wildly gaz'd And the Gods seem all amaz'd. II. Know, in sight of this Day's Sun, Such a Deed is to be done, Black enough to shroud the Light Of all this World in dismal Night. I. What is this Deed? II. To kill a Man, The Greatest since Mankind began: Learned, eloquent and wise, Gen'rous, merciful and brave! I. Yet not too great a Sacrifice, The Liberty of Rome to save? II. But will not Goodness claim Regard? And does not Worth deserve Reward? I. Does not their Country lye at stake? Can they do too much for her sake? Both together. Tho' dreadful be this Doom of Fate, Just is that Pow'r which governs all: Better this wond'rous Man should fall, Than a most glorious, virtuous State.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Scene, a Street, through which CÃ¦sar passes in Pomp to the Senate-House, attended by those Senators who were with him at the end of the former Act. Enter Spurinna hastily. CÃSAR. The Ides of March are come. (To Spurinna. SPURINNA. But not yet past. Be pleas'd, Great CÃ¦sar, to peruse this Parchment. MESSALA. 'Tis from a Friend of CÃ¦sar this Petition; At your first leisure read his humble suit. SPURINNA. Oh, CÃ¦sar, read mine first, 'tis for your Safety: Read it, Great CÃ¦sar, read it instantly. CÃSAR. What most concerns our self shall last be read: I'll lay it up against a time of leisure. (To Cassius. CASSIUS. What, do you trouble CÃ¦sar in the Street? Bring your Petitions to the Capitol. SPURINNA. But, mine concerns his Life. CASSIUS. I know it does; Therefore away, we'll all take care of that. SCENE II. The Scene is changed to the Senate-House, which appears full of Senators, who all rise up at CÃ¦sar's coming One of them whispers Brutus. SENATOR. All good Success attend your Enterprize. CASSIUS. What did he say? BRUTUS He wish'd me good Success. CASSIUS. See, he makes up to CÃ¦sar earnestly. We are betrayed! But I will kill my self; CÃ¦sar, or Cassius, never shall go back. BRUTUS. There is no Danger, Cassius; CÃ¦sar smiles; You may perceive they talk of something else. DECIMUS BRUTUS. Let's all kneel round to beg for Cymber's Life. BRUTUS. 'Tis mean at any time, but needless now; Go you, I will not kneel. CASSIUS. Well, what you please. Casca strikes first; but stay, CÃ¦sar will speak. SCENE III. CÃ¦sar sits on a Seat above the rest; then rises up and speaks, while the Senators stand round him. Now, Rev'rend Lords, if any weighty Thoughts Oppress your Minds, unload your Cares on me; For, that's a Burthen which belongs to Power. Is there a barbarous People yet so rude, Or so remote, as not to fear your Arms? I'll make them join with all the World besides In due submission to superiour Virtue. Is that great Parthian King so haughty grown, As not to reverence this awful Senate? My Arms shall haste to humble all his Pride, And bring him bowing to your least Commands. Others, to raise themselves, depress their Country; But my Ambition is to make your Valour Shine out more bright to all the subject World. Yet vain were all my Triumphs, if I should Be fear'd abroad, and not belov'd at home; Therefore, what Enemy have I not pardon'd? The name of Foe excuses Hate, and Harm; And he that fears it least, forgives it soonest. Cold Friends, indeed, are something more provoking; Yet I can pass them by with scorn and pity. The equal Law shall run its even course; Nothing shall interpose, except my Mercy; Justice her self may lean that way sometimes. Plain Merit shall not languish unregarded, While cunning Courtship steals away the Favour. On this depend; and while I govern thus, You will not grudge, if I shall govern long; And not resign my Pow'r, like unlearn'd Sylla, For want of Skill to use it. CASCA. Oh, I can hold no longer. (They all stab CÃ¦sar, who struggles with them till he sees Brutus strike. CÃSAR What, Brutus too! Nay, then 'tis time to dye. (Falls down, and covers himself with his Robes. BRUTUS. Liberty, Freedom! Tyranny is dead. Nay stir not, worthy Lords, nor be amaz'd; We mean no harm to any Roman here: Consul, retire, for fear the coming Crowd Should press too much upon your rev'rend Age. CASSIUS. Run to the Streets, and cry out Liberty! Ring in their Ears aloud that pleasing Sound. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in CÃ¦sar's Blood, Bespot our Garments, and besmear our Swords; Then walk we forth into the Market-place, And waving our red Weapons o'er our Heads, Cry out aloud, Freedom and Liberty! BRUTUS. The Deed is done, what need we triumph in it? SCENE IV. Enter a Senator. Well now, what News? SENATOR. The People are amaz'd, Cry out, and stare, and run about the Streets, As in an Earthquake. (They all stoop down to CÃ¦sar's Body except Brutus. CASCA. How many Ages hence Shall this our lofty Scene be acted o'er, In States unborn, and Accents yet unknown? TREBONIUS. How many times shall CÃ¦sar bleed in Sport, While the attentive Throng shall melt in Tears, To see his Fall! BRUTUS. As oft as that shall be, So often shall this Knot of us be call'd The Men who gave their Country Liberty. Let's venture forth. CASSIUS. Come on then, let's away Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his steps With all the best and boldest Sons of Rome. BRUTUS. What, Antony return'd, and without Arms! SCENE V. Enter Antony, and taking no notice of them, falls on his knees to CÃ¦sar's Body. ANTONY. I was unable to defend thy Life, And therefore now can scarce endure my own, Thou great good Man! Is all thy Race of Glory Brought to this wretched end? Didst thou scorn Death In all those bloody Fields, to find it here? Oh, 'tis I feel it; thou art past the pain; But in my Heart 'tis acted o'er and o'er. For every Thought of thee, and of thy Love, Gives me fresh Sorrow: take my Tribute here Of Sighs and Tears that always shall attend thee. I ask your pardon, Noble Lords; my thoughts Were too much there, to look on ought besides. Yet think not I repent of what I said; For I will speak the praises of my Friend, Nor fear ev'n Heav'n, should it reply in Thunder. He was my Friend, and I will still be his, Tho' the Gods rage, and Mankind meanly joins; Who shew regard to Heav'n in nothing else But slighting Merit, when the Gods forsake it. Yet I, of all suspected, and alone, Will boldly thus embrace this precious Body. Nay, gaze not on me with such threatning looks; Think not, that if I valu'd now my Life, I am so foolish to expose it thus. What Hour so fit for me, what Death so glorious, As here to fall with CÃ¦sar, and by you, The Master Spirits, sure, of all the World; Kill me then quickly; kill me with those Daggers That reek in Blood of him I lov'd so well: For, could I languish out a thousand Years, I ne'er should find my self so fit to dye: 'Tis now a Pleasure, what may be a Pain. BRUTUS. Oh, Antony, beg not your Death of us. You little think, when you commended CÃ¦sar, How much my soften'd Heart approv'd your Praise. Rough tho' we seem, and tho' our Hands are bloody, Yet, Antony, you only see our Hands, Which, free as those of Justice from all Rage, Have done a Deed, spite of our softer Souls. Your Friendship to dead CÃ¦sar we esteem, And value yours the more: then join with us To settle Rome firm in its ancient Freedom; And we will join with you to make you great; As great as can consist with Liberty. CASSIUS. Your Voice shall sound as high as any Man's In the Election of new Magistrates. BRUTUS. Only be patient till you hear the Cause Of all this seeming Cruelty. You know CÃ¦sar us'd me as kindly as your self. Were I ambitious, or sought private ends, This, sure, was not the way. Witness, you Gods! None e'er who kill'd himself, lov'd him he slew Better than I lov'd CÃ¦sar! ANTONY. Oh my Heart! Hold up a while, and help me to dissemble! (Aside. Give me your hands, I must accept your Love Most Noble Brutus; and yours, Caius Cassius. Alas, my Credit stands on slipp'ry ground; And there's a Precipice on either side. To answer this your Gentleness with Rage, (When you thus spare me ev'n against my will) That would appear but a too rough return: Yet may not this too look like Fear, or Flatt'ry? That I lov'd CÃ¦sar, I must ever own; That he lov'd me, his Favours shew'd too well: How shall I do my part to him, and you? Unless you will vouchsafe to give me Reasons Why CÃ¦sar dy'd; and let me bury him, (As it becomes his Friend) with decent Honour: Then I'll but steep his Ashes in my Tears, And in his cold Urn smother all my Sorrow. BRUTUS. 'Tis just, we grant it; take his Body hence; And I will join my self to do him honour. CASSIUS. Hold, Brutus; first consider well of that: The easy Rabble may be mov'd against us. Who knows how Rhet'ric may prevail on Fools? BRUTUS. We need not, Cassius, be so much concern'd; Now Rome's secure, there's no such thing as Danger. 'Twas CÃ¦sar's Soul we fear'd, and that once gone, We cannot use his harmless Corps too well. CASSIUS. But yet I fear the worst. BRUTUS. Besides I'll go, And speak before him in the Market-place. But Antony, your Praise must be so nice, As not to blame our Action: you may shew Both Love to CÃ¦sar, and Esteem of us. CASSIUS. His Speech shall be your pattern; so we leave you To pay that Pity which you owe your Friend. (Exeunt all but Antony. SCENE VI. Antony, who stands over the Body of CÃ¦sar alone. ANTONY. Pity indeed! but what a wretched change, That thou should'st move it! Thou, whose wondrous Soul Was high as e'er Humanity attain'd; Yet gentle as the humblest of Mankind. (Enter some Friends of Antony. Thy vast Ambition was but just, and like The Element of Fire when first created, Which soar'd above the rest, to shine more glorious, And chear the under World with Light and Heat. Thou still shalt shine a Comet, and portend A black and bloody Scene of Civil War. These Wounds inspire me with prophetick Skill, Which like dumb Mouths op'ning their bloody Lips, Seem to entreat the utt'rance of my Tongue. Now the whole World disturb'd, will miss thee soon; Men shall bemoan their Master, beat their Breasts, And lay upon thy Death all their Misfortunes. Wars, Bloodshed, Massacres, such horrid Deeds, And fatal Fury, shall be so familiar, That Custom shall take off all sense of Crime, And Shame and Guilt shall be but Words forgot, Lost in the boundless Licence of the Times. Come, let us bear him to the Market-place. This is a Jewel yet, tho' drop'd by Fortune; With which we'll purchase Popularity, And set up for our selves in this new World. Our Tears and Grief will soften their hard Hearts, Fit to receive impression from our words. And when Crowds listen once, there is no Fear, They have the People's Hearts, who have their Ear. (Exeunt with the Body of CÃ¦sar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To be Sung after the Fourth Act. Fourth CHORUS. How great a Curse has Providence Thought fit to cast on Human Kind! Learning, Courage, Eloquence, The gentlest Nature, noblest Mind, Were intermix'd in one alone, Yet in one Moment overthrown! Could Chance, or senseless Atoms join To form a Soul so great as his? Or would those Pow'rs we hold Divine, Destroy their own chief Master-piece? Where so much Difficulty lyes, The doubtful are the only wise. And, what must more perplex our Thoughts; Great Jove the best of Romans sends, To do the very worst of Faults, And kill the kindest of his Friends. All this is far above our reach, Whatever Priests presume to preach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. SCENE the Forum. Enter Brutus and Cassius, followed by Crowds of Citizens. FIRST CITIZEN. Behold the Men who have deliver'd Rome. SECOND CITIZEN. Brutus has freed us all, and he shall rule us. THIRD CITIZEN. We will be free, and serve the Noble Brutus. BRUTUS. Why Friends, ye speak Impossibilities; Would ye be free, yet serve? how odd that sounds! I grieve to see you bear your change no better. But give me leave to satisfie you all, Why we have done this Deed, and for whose sakes. I'll go up here; they who will hear me, stay; The rest may follow Cassius, and hear him. FIRST CITIZEN. I would hear Brutus speak. SECOND CITIZEN. I'll follow Cassius. And we'll compare together what they say. THIRD CITIZEN. The Noble Brutus is ascended: Silence. BRUTUS. Friends, dearest Countrymen, and worthy Romans; You lovers of your Laws and Liberties; Hear me throughout with Patience, not with Passion: For, tho' your kindness is my chief Contentment, I would not owe your judgment of this Deed To any thing but Reason well inform'd. Who is it here thinks CÃ¦sar innocent? I was his Friend, and yet I thought him guilty; And Faults are great, which Friends cannot forgive. Why should I kill him then but for your sakes? A Wretch who yields a Limb to be cut off, Does only that to save a Life that's dearer: And when a grieving Parent whips his Child, Call it Correction, but not Cruelty. If then the very best of CÃ¦sar's Friends Shou'd ask me why I kill'd him? Thus I answer: It was not that I lov'd him less than he, But 'twas because I lov'd my Country more. Wou'd you have CÃ¦sar live, and dye all Slaves; Rather than have him dead, to live all Freemen? As CÃ¦sar lov'd me, oh I weep for him; As he was fortunate, I can rejoice; As he was valiant, I honour him; But, as he was Ambitious, I slew him. Who's here so base, as would become a Bondman? If any, speak; for him I have offended. Who's here so rude, that would not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him I have offended. Who's here so vile, to value any thing, Ev'n his best Friend, before the Publick Good? I own, nay boast, I have offended him. What say you Countrymen? CITIZEN. None, Brutus, none. BRUTUS. Then none have I offended by his Death. The Reason for it shall be fair enroll'd; His Glory not diminish'd in the least. Here comes his Body, mourn'd by good Antonius. Enter Antony with the Body of CÃ¦sar. Who, tho' a Friend of CÃ¦sar, is ours too; And so has leave to bury him with Honour. In a Free Government all should be Friends: And he, who would have sav'd this CÃ¦sar's Life, Shall yet receive advantage by his Death, Freedom of Vote in governing the World: As which of you shall want it? I conclude; That, as I slew my Friend to save my Country, I here have the same Dagger for my self, Whenever Rome shall wish, or need my Death. (Descends. FIRST CITIZEN. Live, Brutus, live: bring him in Triumph home. SECOND CITIZEN. Give him a Statue by his Ancestors. THIRD CITIZEN. Let him be CÃ¦sar. FOURTH CITIZEN. CÃ¦sar was nothing to him; Let him be crown'd, I will have Brutus crown'd. BRUTUS. Hold worthy Countrymen. FIRST CITIZEN. Peace; Silence. SECOND CITIZEN. Peace; for Brutus speaks again. BRUTUS. You'll make me draw this Dagger once again; But 'tis against my self; for I would dye Your fellow Friend, rather than live your Lord. You almost make me wish CÃ¦sar alive: If one must rule, there's none could do it better. Pray hear Marc-Antony, for my sake hear him; He speaks by our Permission, and is noble. But, while he praises CÃ¦sar, then remember I honour'd him as much but lov'd you more. Nay, stay good Romans; not a Man go with me. (Exit. FIRST CITIZEN. This CÃ¦sar was a Tyrant; Brutus says so; And no Man living knows a Tyrant better. SECOND CITIZEN. For, Neighbours, why should Brutus kill him else? He lov'd him. Therefore sure he was a Tyrant. THIRD CITIZEN. Notably said! answer me that who can. But come, let's hear Marc Antony a little. ANTONY. For Brutus' sake I am beholden to you. FIRST CITIZEN. What's that of Brutus? best speak well of Brutus. SECOND CITIZEN. How's this? What does he say, for Brutus sake? THIRD CITIZEN. He says, for Brutus sake he is beholden to us. SECOND CITIZEN. Oh, very well; go up Marc Antony. ANTONY. Shall I go up, and will you give me leave? Citizen. Ay, ay. (Antony ascends. ANTONY. Friends, Countrymen, and Romans, hear me gently; I come to bury CÃ¦sar, not to praise him. Lo here the fatal end of all his Glory: The Evil that Men do lives after them; The Good is often bury'd in their Graves; So let it be with CÃ¦sar. Noble Brutus Has told you CÃ¦sar was ambitious: If he was so, then he was much to blame; And he has dearly paid for his Offence. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest, I come to do my duty to dead CÃ¦sar. He was my Friend, faithful and just to me; But yet it seems he was Ambitious. Brutus has said it, I must say it too; For Brutus is a Man of strictest Honour. Thousands of Captives CÃ¦sar brought to Rome, Whose Ransom often fill'd the Publick Coffers. Was this Ambition? Brutus says it was: And Brutus is an honourable Man. When wretched Orphans cry'd, CÃ¦sar would weep; So weep for them, that they have wept no more: Ambition seldom is so tender-hearted. You all have seen how at the Publick Sports, Out of a foolish and too forward Love, He was presented with a Kingly Crown, Which he then thrice refus'd; was this Ambition? Yet Brutus says he was Ambitious, And Brutus is a Man we all must honour. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But must as little wrong this dead, good Man. You all did love him once, not without cause: And will you hate him dead, whom you lov'd living? O Justice, Justice! whither art thou fled? For Men have lost their Reason. Bear with me; My Heart's beneath that Mantle there with CÃ¦sar; And I must pause a while till it comes back. (Weeps. FIRST CITIZEN. Methinks there's much of Reason in his Sayings, If you consider rightly of the matter. CÃ¦sar has had some wrong. SECOND CITIZEN. Has he, my Masters? They will have much ado to make amends to him. I fear there will a worse come in his place. THIRD CITIZEN. Mark'd you his words? he would not take the Crown. Therefore 'tis certain he was not Ambitious. FIRST CITIZEN. If it be found so, some shall pay dear for it. SECOND CITIZEN. See, if good Antony can speak for weeping! THIRD CITIZEN. There's not a nobler Man in Rome than Antony. SECOND CITIZEN. But mark him, he begins again to speak. ANTONY. But yesterday the word of CÃ¦sar might Have pass'd thro' all the World: Now he lyes there, And none so low to do him reverence. Oh Romans, if I were dispos'd to move Your Hearts and Minds to Mutiny and Rage, I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honourable Men. Yet here's a Parchment with the Seal of CÃ¦sar, I found it in his Closet; 'tis his Will: Let but the Commons hear this Testament, (Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read) And they would run and kiss dead CÃ¦sar's Wounds, And dip their Napkins in his sacred Blood; Nay beg a hair of his for Memory, And dying, mention it within their Wills, Bequeathing it as a rich Legacy To their dear Issue. FOURTH CITIZEN. We'll hear this Will: read it Marc Antony. ALL. The Will, the Will, we must hear CÃ¦sar's Will. ANTONY Have patience, gentle Friends; I must not read it; It is not fit you know how CÃ¦sar lov'd you. You are not Wood, you are not Stones, but Men; And being Men, hearing the Will of CÃ¦sar, It will enflame you, it will make you mad: 'Tis well, you know not that you are his Heirs, For if you did, oh what might come of it? THIRD CITIZEN. Read the Will, Antony, for we will hear it. ANTONY. Will you be patient? will you stay a while? I have o'ershot my self to tell you of it; I fear I wrong the honourable Men, Whose Daggers stab'd the undefended CÃ¦sar FIRST CITIZEN. Traytors and Rogues! they honourable Men? FIRST CITIZEN. Villains and Murderers! Come, read the Will. ANTONY. You will compell me then to read the Will. Then make a Ring about the Corps of CÃ¦sar, And let me shew you him that made the Will. Shall I descend? and will you give me leave? ALL. Come down. FIRST CITIZEN. Descend, you shall have leave. SECOND CITIZEN. A Ring! THIRD CITIZEN. Stand off a while; stand from the Body there. FOURTH CITIZEN. Make room for Antony, most noble Antony. ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me, gentle Friends. If you have Tears, prepare to shed 'em now. You all have seen this Mantle; I remember The first time ever CÃ¦sar put it on; 'Twas on a Summer's Evening in his Tent, After a glorious Fight against your Foes. Look, in this place ran Cassius' Dagger through! See what a Rent the envious Casca made! Here, here, the well-beloved Brutus stab'd; And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away, Mark how the Blood of CÃ¦sar follow'd it! As rushing out abroad, to be resolv'd If it were Brutus so unkindly struck? For Brutus, as you know, was CÃ¦sar's Fav'rite; Judge, O you Gods, how dearly CÃ¦sar lov'd him; This, this was the unkindest Stroke of all! For when undaunted CÃ¦sar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than Traytor's Arms, Quite vanquish'd him. Then burst his mighty Heart; Then in his Mantle muffling up his Face, Under a Crowd of Villains, CÃ¦sar fell. Oh what a Fall was there, my Countrymen! Then I, and you, and Rome itself too fell, While bloody Treason flourish'd o'er our Heads. Oh now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of Pity; these are worthy drops. Kind Souls, what weep you when you but behold Our CÃ¦sar's Vesture torn? O then look here: Here is himself, mangled you see by Traytors! (Takes off the Mantle. FIRST CITIZEN. O mournful Sight! SECOND CITIZEN. O cruel Traytors, Villains! THIRD CITIZEN. O Noble CÃ¦sar! but we'll be reveng'd. Set Fire, kill, slay, let not a Traytor live. ANTONY. Stay Countrymen. FOURTH CITIZEN. Peace there, he speaks again. ALL. We'll hear him, follow him, and dye with him. ANTONY. Good Friends, dear Friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden Flame of Mutiny. They who have done this Deed are Men of Note: What private Griefs they had, alas I know not, Which made them do it; they are wondrous wise, And will, no doubt, give you some shew of Reason. I come not, Friends, to steal away your Hearts: I am no Orator, as Cassius is; But as you know me all, a plain, blunt Man Who love my Friend; and that they know full well Who gave me leave to speak in publick of him: For I have neither Art, nor Words, nor Worth, Action, nor Utt'rance, nor the pow'r of Speech, To stir Men's Blood; I only speak plain truth, And tell you that which you already know: Shew you dear CÃ¦sar's Wounds, poor, poor dumb Mouths, And bid them speak for me: But, were I Brutus, And Brutus here; so great an Orator Would rouze up ev'ry Soul, and put a Tongue In ev'ry Wound of CÃ¦sar, which should move The very Stones to rise and mutiny. ALL. We'll mutiny; we'll burn the House of Brutus. FOURTH CITIZEN. Away then, come, seek the Conspirators. ANTONY. Yet hear me, Countrymen, yet hear me speak. ALL. Peace ho! hear Antony, most noble Antony! ANTONY. Why Friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein has CÃ¦sar thus deserv'd your Love? Alas, you know not; I must tell you then. You have forgot the Will I told you of. ALL. 'Tis true, the Will; let's stay and hear the Will. ANTONY. Here is the Will, and under CÃ¦sar's Seal; To ev'ry Roman Citizen he gives, To ev'ry sev'ral Man, sev'nty five Drachma's. THIRD CITIZEN. Well said; those Drachma's will cost some Men dear. ALL. Most gen'rous CÃ¦sar! we'll revenge his Death. ANTONY. Hear me with Patience. ALL. Peace ho! noble CÃ¦sar! ANTONY. Moreover, he has left you all his Walks, His private Gardens, and new-planted Orchards On this side Tyber, here he gives to you, And to your Heirs for ever; publick Pleasures, To walk abroad, and recreate your selves. Here was a CÃ¦sar! when comes such another? ALL. O never, never; come Sirs, come away. ANTONY. Hold, hold, my Masters, stay one Moment longer; Now keep your Hearts from breaking, if you can: Prepare ye now to burst with Grief and Anger. Behold this Scroll, the very hand of CÃ¦sar! In it he notes this firm and settled Purpose, First to subdue the Parthians, our worst Foes, And then restore Rome to her ancient Freedom. âI'll keep the Pow'r, saith he, of Rome's Dictator, âTill I have vanquish'd all her Enemies: âThen, Oh ye Gods! may she be free for ever, âTho' at th' expence of all our dearest Blood! That precious Blood is here indeed let out, But where's the Liberty we purchase by it? Slaves as we are to Murderers and Villains. FIRST CITIZEN. We'll burn his Body in the holy Place, And with the Brands fire all the Villains Houses. SECOND CITIZEN. Take up the Body. THIRD CITIZEN. Go, set fire; pull down The very Senate-House where CÃ¦sar dy'd. ANTONY. So, let it work: Mischief, thou art afoot, Take now what course thou wilt! Destruction, Ruin, The baneful Issue of so black a Deed! Ambition, when unbounded, brings a Curse, But an Assassinate deserves a worse. FINIS.</field>
