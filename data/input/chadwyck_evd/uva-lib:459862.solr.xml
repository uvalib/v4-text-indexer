      <field name="fulltext">Tryphon. A TRAGEDY:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE Spoke By Mr Nokes and Mr Angell. A. Hold, hold. N. Why, Sir? A. What is't you mean to say? N. I mean to speak the Prologue to the Play. A. Therefore to stop you I esteem it fit. N. The Poet then will not be thought a Wit. A. A wit Forsooth! N. Yes, Sir, a wit. A. What's that? N. A wit is in one wordâI know not what. A. Of that kind Title give your Poet Joy. A wit is then in French, A je ne scay quoi. A modish Name. N. Yet, Sir, that Name to gain, How many of our Writers crack their brain? A. That 's a mistake, for who'd that Name contract, Must, e're he Court it, first his brain have crackt. To be a Wit (believe me, Sir, 'tis true) Is the worst State a Man can Fall into. The Wits first vow, is, that they none will spare, But jeer at every Creature that they dare; And the No-Wits, these Wits so dis esteem, That they give Money oft to hiss at them; 'Tis the Wits Nature, or at best their Fate, Others to scorn, and one another hate. They would be Sultans if they had their will, For each of them would all his Brothers kill. N. Hold, Sir, the Wits you too severely school. A. I say, to be a Wit's to be a Fool; For who but such a Creature would not grudge, T'have any one for half a Crown his Judge; Nay, toil, that he such a wise Act may do, Then lets the Players get the half Crown too. N. Why was this Play then by the Author writ? A. In fear, 'tis said, of being call'd a Wit. And many a Man does doubt that is his Friend, Ere three hours hence he will have reach'd his end. N. Take heed, if at this rate we gable more Our Poet will attain his end before. A. For fear of that 'tis best we should be gone. N. What without Prologue? A. I'm resolv'd to have none. For some on Wit that needless Tax did lay, Which Poets now are grown too poor to pay. But yet as mettled School-boyes set to cuff, Will not confess that they have done enough, Though deadly weary, till spectators do At once both part and call them good Boys too; But then these Cuffers monstrous joyful are: Just thus it would with all our Poets fare, Would you decree (what I for them implore) Poets with Prologues nere should meddle more. 'Tis the best thing you for your selves could do, For Prologues first tire Poets and then you; If you'l not do't, while in your power it lies, They'l do it of themselves, if they be wise: Our Poets tyr'd, and has with Prologues done, But those which yet are fresh, let them cuff on.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST ACT. The Scene is the Garden of Tryphon's Palace in Antioch. Demetrius and Aretus. Dem. Tryphon, I grant, through Seas of blood has gone To force his passage to the Syrian Throne; But how men gain their Pow'r the Gods do not So much regard, as how 'tis us'd when got. Our Murther'd King Antiochus did own, That Tryphons Father did restore his Crown; Which made him trust the Sons ambitious youth With so much pow'r as did corrupt his truth: This our dead Prince discover'd, but too late, Which did provoke Tryphon to act his fate: For Kings should not to too great Subjects shew They mean their ruine, till they act it too; And he too much deserves to lose his Throne Who makes a Subject's power exceed his own. Are. What ever you in his defence have brought, Rather then lessen doth augment his fault; For what could show this Tyrant more unjust Then to abuse such gratitude and trust; Trust, which the wicked often does reclame, This Monster's wickedness does more inflame. That he repents nothing can us perswade, Since what makes others good has made him bad. Dem. When once Ambition does the mind devour, Men Sacrifice their Vertue to their Pow'r. Antiochus has rais'd him up so high, As he was either to usurp, or die; And when he had perceiv'd the Kings distrust, It made him think, that what was safe was just. Are. Oh let him not be pleaded for by you, Who did his King depose and murther too, Lest on your self th'Usurpers guilt you bring; Dem. 'Tis less to kill, then to arraign a King; And he who does an Empires loss endure Cannot think death a punishment, but cure. Are. But Actions should be taken as they are meant. Dem. To vindicate him is not my intent; Since all which can in his excuse be said Is, that his Pride his Virtue has betray'd. Are. No glimps of vertue e're in him could shine Who kill'd his King, and all the Royal line. Dem. After he had the chief of it supprest, He thought it was unsafe to save the rest. Are. Ambition made him act the Parricide, And Cruelty must then preserve his Pride. By the same rule he ought to shed the blood Of all his Country-men that dare be good: Then from the Throne let us th'Usurper fling. To save our selves, and to Revenge the King: For should we to this Tyranny submit, We shall deserve as well as suffer it: And to the virtuous 'twill much worse appear Such a misfortune to deserve then bear. That Tryphon calls you favourite I know, But to his Fear alone that name you ow: Yet though the kindness which he feigns were true, If layes the ground of what I call you to; From you he merits death, since he hath dar'd To hope, such Friendship could such Guilt have spar'd. Dem. Whom Tryphon fears he doth to death pursue, And if he fear'd me he might kill me too, But, that he fears me not, he could not give A stronger proof then that he lets me live. Yet do not think his friendship such a charm, As from revenge it could confine my arme; But if my patience you a sin esteem, It springs from Love to Syria, not to him: For since the Royal line are made away, Were Tryphon kill'd, who should the Scepter sway? All the Ambitious for the Throne would fight, For where none has the Title, all have Right. Thus while we cast a bloody Tyrant down By Blood, we raise another to the Crown. 'Tis this, 'tis this which chiefly frightens me, We may change Tyrants, not the Tyranny. Where Force is Title, Force must make it good, And who comes in by Armes must reign by Blood. Are. Banish such groundless fears, for he alone Who kills the Tyrant should ascend his Throne. Who from this Tyranny does Syria free, All will confess, deserves our King to be. If by your Arm this generous Act is done, Saving the Kingdom you'll deserve the Crown. Dem. Oh my Aretus should I yield to this, T'would then be my Ambition punish'd his: And he's unfit a Tyrant to dethrone Who with his Countreys ends dare mix his own; Since Tryphon is call'd King, I'le rather bear His Tyranny then be his Murtherer, That name Aretus is a sacred thing. Are. But Tryphon's an Usurper, not a King. Ah shall he keep his blood from being spilt, By taking off that name which makes his guilt: If such a principle we should endure, Then the most guilty would be most secure. Dem. What ever sins to gain a Crown are done, The God's do pardon when they put in on. We ought, when Heav'ns Vicegerent does a Crime, To leave to Heav'n the right to punish him. Those who for wrongs their Monarchs murther act, Worse sins then they can punish they contract: And while his favour I so much possess, My Pow'r will hinder any new excess. Are. But from new crimes while Tryphon you withhold, You bribe our swords from punishing the old. Dem. He that's so bad as to gain pow'r by Blood, Some reparation makes if he turn good; And 'tis my hope as much as 'tis my care, To fill his Court with those who virtuous are. If Virtue in his Court it self advance, Vice there will soon grow out of countenance. That he no more into new crimes may fall, Hee'll make this day Nicanor General; And our Seleucus free from Vice as Fear Shall head the guardsâ Tryphon, Nicanor, Seleucus and Tryphon's Guards. But Tryphon does appear Who must not see me since he sent me now On an affair which you at night shall know. Demet. and Aret. go out several ways. Try. No, no, Nicanor, I can truly own My safety made me chiefly take the Crown; Antiochus had rais'd me to such height As I had felt what was an Empire's weight, And scarce th'Ambitious would be brought to reign If with the Pomps of Pow'r they knew the Pain: But when false doubts of me his mind did fill, Then whom he Rais'd he had design'd to Kill: And though the Father plac'd him in the Throne, Yet this return he would have made the Son; Finding that he or I must be opprest, I of two evils did embrace the least; Since to my Services he was severe, From him what might not his best Subjects fear; Which shows, my Countreys good in what was done As much did urge me to it as my own. Nica. Sir, you have known me long, and that my heart In what I speak disdains the vails of art: If therefore you would now my silence break, Be not offended if I freely speak. Try. Nought you can say, such an offence will be, As doubting freedom can be so to me. Nica. Then Sir, my mind I'le freely speak to you Yet with that reverence which to Kings is due. I know your Fathers Valour, and your own Did to Antiochus restore his Throne; Since for your King you did that Service do, Ah Sir, forget not 'twas your duty too: Subjects, too oft, whose services are great Consider that as merit, which is debt; And have the ruine of their Kings design'd, Judging them cruel when not over-kind: Those are sad truths which Histories oft show, Judge Sir if this has been your case, or no. Try. I need no clearer proof to let you see That once Antiochus was kind to me, Then, when he alter'd and my murther meant, I by his ruine could my own prevent: To me his kindness he had largely shown, Trusting me with a Pow'r above his own; Had he but told me he'd that Power recall, I at his feet would have resign'd it all; But why because he rais'd me up so high Should he conclude I merited to Die? If he did erre, placing me where I stood, Why must his fault be washt off with my Blood. Nica. Ah Sir, though this had been the state of things, Yet subjects, Sir, should die to save their Kings; Much rather they their own death should endure Then by their King's their Safety's to procure; And Virtue does oblige us, where 'tis strong, Rather to suffer then to act a wrong. Try. But Natures Dictates which no man can wave Obliges every one his Life to save. Nica. Nature whose Dictates in defence you bring, Ties subjects by their Deaths to save their King, Nature is Reason, Sir, and that does show More to our Kings then to ourselves we owe, For in a subjects Death but one does fall, But a King's Life contains the Life of All. Seleu, Yet though your Safety, Sir, did you Incline To Kill your King, you might have spar'd his Line, Oh, Sir, you needed not their Bloods have spilt. Try. Their Births to me Seleucus, made their Guilt, Who his own Murther by his Monarch's Shuns, Makes it more certain if he spares his Sons. Sel. But though to save the Sons unsafe was held, Why was Antiochus the grandchild kill'd? An Infant who was then not two years old? Try. Whatever of his Death my Foes have told, Yet to you both here solemnly I Vow, That child, for ought I know, is living now, And one who oft informes me what is True Tell's me Nicanor, he's conceall'd by you. Nica. I doe not doubt but many there may be, Too apt to give ill Characters of me, But, Sir, I think if you reflection make, With what Affront the King from me did take The Generals place, you'l scarce believe he durst To one so wrong'd commit so great a Trust, Yet if you think it trueâ Try. âNicanor hold, 'Tis not what I believe but what I'm told; And to convince you what I say is true, The Generals Office I restore to you; If I to Syria meant not to be Just, I would not lodge in you so great a Trust; A Trust which if I use the Syrians ill, Gives power to punish me, and Pow'r gives Will! Nic. That Trust which, Sir, you now on me would lay, Does merit more then I have Pow'r to pay, But when my King did wrong me, I did swear No publick Office I again would bear, Forgive me, Sir, since 'tis a Sacred Vow Makes me decline what you have offer'd now, I should for such a Trust appear unfit, If I forswore my self accepting it. Try. Take heed, for if this Offer be refus'd, I may believe you Justly are accus'd. Nic. You should methinkss much rather, Sir, from thence See my Foes Malice and my Innocence; Were I possest of the Thrones lawfull heir, Why should I wave a Pow'r might place him there. Try. But if you would accept what I restore, That Action would convince me of it more, For since your Vertue binds you to be just, 'Twould bind you too not to betray your Trust; Yet I'l believe 'tis nothing but your Vow Keeps you from taking what I offer'd now, You shall therein by me no more be prest, And that you may still on my Friendship rest, Demetrius is this day imploy'd by me In an Affair shall let Nicanor see, That I have made it now my chiefest End To make him by a sacred tye my Friend Seleucus, whose High Worth deserves Rewards, Shall from this day be Captain of my Guards. Sel. This Trust I'l strive to merit by my Care. Nic. Those clearliest show that they your Servants are Who at your Faults judge it a sin to winke, And tell you Truths which others scarce dare think. Sel. Those who their Princes flatter May be thought Guiltier then those who have against them fought, Since more by Flattery have been undone Then have been ruin'd by Rebellion. Nic. Monarchs those servants highest should esteem Who, when they err, dare not but tell it them, And he who does by Force a Throne obtain, Ought to repair it by a Generous Reign. Try. This Freedome and the Council which you give As Proofs of both your Friendships I receive, And I resolve my Reign shall be so good As shall outweigh my want of right by Blood.

That sacred Friendship which so firm has stood, And joyns us more than Nature does by Blood, Makes me not fear, dear Sister, you'l believe, That 'tis my Envy this advice does give; Demetrius has but too officious been, Perswading Tryphon to make you his Queen; Improve his Error to exalt your Fame, And scorn both Tryphon's scepter and his Flame, You'l merit to a lawful Throne to rise, If an unlawfull one you can despise, Since greater to the Vertuous twill appear A Crown to Merit then a Crown to Wear. Cleo. Though Tryphon did by Blood the Crown obtain, Yet a Crown worn doth wash off every Stain. Stra When Heaven admits a Tyrant to a Throne, 'Tis but from Vaster Heights to cast him down, To doe it whil'st hee's climbing would appear A less Revenge, then being seated there, And since such Guilt does most the Gods incense, The Punishment should equall the Offence. Cleo. Since he, while Wicked, in the Throne has stood, The Gods will not depose him now hee's Good, His past Offences he does much deplore. Stra. That for their Vengeance ripens him the more, For men might think, were not quick Justice done, Repentance Usurpation might atone. Cleo. Ah Sister, those to whom the Gods allow Repentance, with it give their Pardon too. Stra. But those who to destroy their Kings consent, Heaven lets them never perfectly Repent, But leaves them quite, when they so Wicked bee, His Sorrow is but his Hypocrisy. Cleo. Let not your Vertue Judge against your Sight, Nor limit Mercy which is Infinite; But since a Crown is still the gift of Heaven. What matter is it by what Hand 'tis given. Stra. When by a Tyrants Hand a Crown is given, How can you think that Crown the Gift of Heaven. Cleo. Since Tryphon's in the Throne, what Syrian dare, Without a Crime, dispute how he came there. Stra, Rather what Syrian who dares Vertue own, Thinks not hee's bound to cast him from the Throne. My Father great Nicanor, I dare say, Thinks this a Duty which he ought to Pay; You from this Duty may his hand restrain, If you wish Tryphon in one Throne should Reign. Cleo. Usurpers, who inforc'd their Crimes forsake, For all past Crimes full satisfaction make; If I by Love continue Tryphon Good, Nicanor ought not then to shed his Blood; If he relapse, he by his Death may prove, His Countrey he more then his Son does love, Syria to us, what Tryphon ere shall doe, Either his Change or her Revenge shall owe. Stra. Ah think not Love the softest thing that is Can dwell in such a Cruel Heart as his. Cleo. Rather believe since Love has him Inflam'd, His Heart from Cruelty is now reclaim'd. Stra. Since by such Guilt he in the Throne does sit, Rather believe his Vertue Counterfeit. Cleo. 'Tis the least Miracle which Love can doe To change dissembled Vertue into true. Stra. Ah Cleopatra, this discourse has shown You'l lose your Happiness to gain his Throne, For I was now, in brave Aretus name, To have disclos'd to you his hidden Flame, A Flame so High and so Respectfull too, As it appear'd worthy of him and you; Oh had you seen the Fear in which he spoke, When he my help did in his Love invoke, It would have you as well as me it mov'd, That Fear had let you see how much he Lov'd. Cleo. Aretus ought to blush that durst appear At once my Lover and admit a Fear. Stra. He of that Fear, rather then blush, should boast, Since Flames which highest rise still tremble most. Cleo. Sure, my dear Stratonice, this is but said Me from the Love of Tryphon to diswade, For did Aretus Burn to such degree, He would have first disclos'd his flame to me; Draw not from what his High Respect does prove, An argument that he is not in Love. Her. I have observ'd, so has Irene too, Of late Aretus often gaz'd on you, And when by chance your Eyes on him were turnd, He with a Sigh would seem to say he burn'd. Irene. I must acknowledge, Madam, I admire, That you did ne'r take notice of his Fire; Hermione and I have often said, Never more Love in any Looks were read. Cleo. Tis haypy for him that he ne'r did dare Himself to me his Passion to declare, For if he had been Guilty of that Crime Twould have supprest th'Esteem I have for him. Stra. His Vertue the Esteem of all does move, But is there nothing due unto his Love? Cleo. Yes, yes, my Pitty while it is conceal'd, But hate when 'tis by him to me reveal'd. Stra. You more then he should this Resolve deplore, Cleo. Press me, dear Stratonice, in this no more, Tryphons Addresse has so Succesfull been, As he has now my Word to be his Queen. Stra. Ah such as have to Thrones of Tyrants rose, Have bin the more expos'd to Fortunes blowes. Cleo. She does not merit on a Throne to sit, Who can fear ought more then to miss of it. Exeunt</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND ACT. The Scene the Palace Garden. Demetrius and Aretus as in discourse: Dem. But for his interrupting of us, you Had then known all which I have told you now: Methinks you seem amaz'd at what I said. Are. Alas your Words have struck me worse then Dead: Fortune no Curse so bad as this could send, Made sharper too, since acted by my Freind. Dem. How could I think that you concern'd had been, In Cleopatra's being Tryphon's Queen. Are. I am so much concern'd in it, that I, Rather then see her Tryphon's Wife, wou'd Dye. Dem. Doe you then love herâ Are. Love's too low a name For that which does Aretus heart Inflame, For never any Fire resembled mine But that Bright Fire which in her Eyes does shine. Dem. Was't fit this Love from me conceal'd should be? Are. Alas 'twas till last night unknown to me, Something I felt of late had Charm'd me so, As did at once Please and Subject me too; But those Emotions were so farr above All that the world has ever known of Love, As, that 'twas Love no more by them I knew, Then I can now describe that Love to you: 'Twas fit that Eyes that shoot unusuall Rayes Should kindle Fires too in unusuall wayes. Dem. I am not Guilty though my self I Blame, But Sure you might suppress so young a Flame, Your Freind from no small Trouble it would free. Are. Ah 'twere not Love, did it depend on me, Those Guilty Words therefore you should recall, Love does not take but gives the Law to all. Would you not think me cruell or unwise Should I beg you not to love Stratonice? Dem. I durst not aske that you'de your Love decline, If it had took so deep a root as mine. Are. Nothing can fix a Love to such degree As Cleopatra's Eyes have done in me. Dem. You have not yet your Conquerors Favour gaind, But I my Stratonice's have obtain'd, That Secret's only trusted to your breast. Are. And there in silence it shall ever rest: But oh in what you say you have not prov'd That I love less than you, but less am lov'd, Success may raise my Joys but not my Flame, The World for Love like mine does want a Name. Dem. Ah my Aretus, had I known before, That you fair Cleopatra did Adore, I had prevented those sad streights we're in, And hindred Tryphon courting her for Queen; Now there's no cure for a disease so high. Are. Yes but there isâ Dem. âwhat is'tâ Are. âTryphon shall dye; On two accompts his death to him I owe, For hee's my Tyrant and my Rivall too; Yet with the last I merit to be curs'd, Since I to kill him needed but the first. Dem. In killing him your Country you'le expose. Are. Not killing him I Cleopatra loose, And he unworthy of her will appeare Who above all things does not value her. Dem. This Truth with greater lustre may be seen, If you would not oppose her being Queen. Are. Ile not oppose (by taking Tryphons life) Her being Queen, but being a Tyrants wife. Dem. Since she would have him as her Choice or Fate, Shee'l take such proofs of Love as proofs of Hate. Are. Her Virtue which has still appear'd so High Shews 'tis a Marriage of Necessity, Which hath engag'd me by one generous blow To free my Mistress and my Countrey too. Farewell Ile goe and act what I intend, And If I fall say you have lost a Freind. Embracing him Dem. Hee'le perish in th'attemptâAretus stay, And is there to your cure no other way? Are. In such a question you mispend your breath, In Rival'd Love what Cure is there but Death. Dem. You'le meet your owne, attempting his I fear. Are. Tis worse than Death to be depriv'd of her, Farewellâwast this for which you call'd me backe. Dem. Stay Friend, for I'me contriving for your sake That which may reach your End a safer way; Suspend th'Attempt the remnant of this day, Since in your Love you are engag'd so farr, To serve you in it 'Ile imploy my care; You know the Pow'r which I with Tryphon have. Are. This is but spoke th'Usurpers Life to save. Dem. How's this, your self as me you now offend; Can you suspect me and yet call me Freind? Are. What I have said in such a Storm of Fate Deserves your pitty rather then your Hate, Doe not the Pardon which I beg deny, Twas my Distraction wrong'd you and not I. Dem. Alas I see you are or'come with Greif. Are. Yet to my Sorrows 'twould be some Releif, Would you then Swear if you in your Designe Should faile, you would assist me then in mine. Dem. But will you swear his Death you'le not attempt, If from his Rivallshipp I you exempt? Are. In such a vow myself I cannot Trust, Tis less to be Unhappy then Unjust, Which I should be if I to you should give A promise that I'de let th'Usurper live. Dem. The Vow which I desire that you would make Is not for Tryphon's but for Syrias sake. Are. Poor Syria! since Demetrius thinks it good To bind me not to shed thy Tyrants Blood, What greater Curse could Heaven on thee have sent, Then make thy safety be thy Punishment. Dem. Since 'tis the will of Heaven we must submit What will you doe, Are, I'le doeâwhat shall be fit. Dem. But will you then too no more condescend, To loose a Rivall and oblige a Freind. Are. Would you have me doe more then what is fit. Dem. But will you Vow to make me Judge of it? If By my Power with Tryphon and my Skill I make him cease to Rival you. Dre. I willâ Oh Cleopatra! never Lover yet Did of his Passion give a Proof so great, With such Devotion to your Eyes I bend, As I pay them what I deny'd my Freind; Nay for their sake, and what more could I doe, I spare the Tyrant of my countrey too; If I in this Act against Duties Laws, Let Love forgive the Effect which Love did cause; Ah Freind! from me you have extorted now That which I feare may prove a Guilty Vow, But you are judge of all which gives me Rest. Dem. Can you then doubt what's trusted to my Breast? Are. You see I doe it not, since I decline Even to inquire what you for me designe. Dem. Feare not, I'le ner'e betray a Trust so High. Are. When you betray me 'tis high time to Dye. [Embracing him they goe out Enter Nicanor, Stratonice, Irene. The Scene Nicanor's Pallace. Stra. I thought my Sister your consent had got. Nic. So farr from getting, that she askd it not; Hermione to me has been Unjust, I left my Cleopatra to her Trust, And know not now which most I should Suspect, Or her Unfaithfulness or her Neglect: Th'Ambition of your Sister, I foresee, Will make her Wretched and will Hazard me; For if she marryes Tryphon Shee's undone, And me hee'le ruine if his Love she shun. Ire. Hermione and I have but one Breast, And she to me did solemnly protest, She not, till 'twas too late, the Business knew, And, Sir, laments for it as much as you. Nic. In such a Fault she'd show herself Unwise, If she from you did not herself disguise. Stra. Hermione is Innocent therein, Sir, 'tis my sisters Fate or else her Sin. Nic. You both absolve Hermione from Guilt, Shew me on what your Confidence is built. Stra. The cause of mine to you, Sir, Ile relate, She Loves my sister and does Tryphon Hate; And would not, Sir, I know, deserve your Frown, To gaine for her own self the Syrian Crown. Iren. I know she does Aretus much esteem, And thinks your Daughter only merits him; And to Hermione he told this day The Love he does to Cleopatra pay; Besides she vow'd to me 'tis her Intent, In that Address, to be her Confident. Nic. Does then Aretus, Cleopatra love? Stra. And in that height, I fear, his Death 'twill prove, For when he knowes shee'l be th'Usurpers Wise, He will attempt his own or Tryphon's Life. Nic. That Happiness at which I most did aime Is now fall'n on me,, but is fall'n in vaine, That Height'ned Worth Aretus still has shewn Makes me esteem him above Tryphon's Throne. My Stratonice, Irene, you and I, Must for this Ill find a quick Remedy; All must assault her in a several way, On Cleopatra my Commands I'll lay, And with Hermione you two must joyne, To make your Sister break off her Designe. Stra. You may be of our best Endeavour sure, But, Sir, I fear this Ill is past our Cure. Nic. Those who of Feare in their Attempts admit, Doe take the surest way to faile in it; Her Resolutions cannot be above Her Duty, Friendship, and Aretus Love; But we lose Time while we together stay, And this Affair admits of no Delay. [They goe out several wayes (Enter Cleopatra, Hermione. The Scene a Garden and a Grove of Trees. Her. Forgive me, Madam, that I thus have prest To know the Grief which does invade your Breast, For though, when you in publick doe appeare, Your Speech is Chearfull and your Looks are Clear, Yet they are clouded when you are alone, And every Word is brought forth with a Groan. Cleo. That which you have observ'd alas is true, Those various Actings to my Fate are due; I ought, since Destin'd to a Tyrants Throne, Joyfull to seem, yet mourn when I'm alone, Nor know I which my Soul does most subdue, Feigning false Joys, or hiding Greif that's true. Her. Rather then Griev me thinks you should Rejoyce, Since Tryphon, Madam, you have made your choice. Cleo. Rather then I, Hermione, would have Tryphon for husband I would wed my Grave. Her. Why did you his Addresses then receive, And ne're so much as ask Nicanor's leave; Had you but to your Father told your mind, He, to prevent it, Something had design'd. Cleo. 'Tis that which made me doe what I have done, For I more feare his Ruine then my owne. This is my Duty which appears my Crime, Better he mourn'd for me then I for him; But now my Word is given 'tis past recall; I'l be Unhappy to prevent his Fall; He gave me Life, and therefore for his sake The Life he gave me I will Wretched make, For such 'twill be when I am Tryphon's Wife; This way alone could Save Nicanor's life, For by th'Usurpers Fury he had dy'd, If he to marry me had been deny'd. Her. Since 'tis your Duty, Madam, as you owne, And not Ambition led you to the Crowne, Why did you not Aretus arm employ, To save your self and Tryphon to destroy? Cleo. Ah I was loath to act the Guilty part Of Owing and not Paying him my Heart. Her. Do you so hate him as you'le Wretched be, Rather then yield his Sword should set you Free, And under Tryphon let your Countrey bow, Sooner then let him save both it and you? Ah, Madam, to my Grief alas I see, That you would now conceal your self from me. Cleo. Think not that I conceal my self from you, Telling you what my Duty made me doe. Ar. Duty might you to marry Tryphon lead. If that alone could save Nicanor's head; But you a much more Easie Way may chuse, To reach that End, and yet that Way refuse, When, Madam, by pursuing of it, you Might save at once Your Self and Countrey too; For none but brave Aretus, that I see, The valour has to end this Tyranny; From which his Love to you will him restrain, If you with Tryphon as his Queen should Raign. Alas, what is the poor Aretus Crime, That rather then you'l be oblig'd to him, You'l of your Contry's Tyrant be the Wife, And which is worse you'll save that Tyrants Life. Cleo. Doe not I shew I think him free from Crime, That lose my self rather then hazard him? Her. In that Attempt he'l but some Hazard runne, But if you marry Tryphon he's undone; Thus from the Hazard you Aretus free, But to destroy him the more certainly; Ah, Madam, by such reas'ning you declare, That in your Confidence I have no share; 'Tis therefore fit our Friendship here should End, For who Distrusts, deserves to Lose a Freind. And since with me so Cruelly you deale, I'l bid you now eternally farewell. Would to the Gods this had been done before, That none might think I like what I Abhorre; But though from you my self I thus divide, Yet still I'l pray that Heaven may be your Guide. Cleo. Raise not the Sorrows under which I bend, By threatning to deprive me of my Friend, This vsage so severe I needs must blame. Her. Why doe you thus abuse that Sacred Name? Alas for me, it is no longer fit, For your Mistrust, Madam, has cancel'd it; Therefore from you for ever will I part. she offers to goe out Cleo. Oh stay and I'l Disclose to you my Heart, Yet with so cross a Fortune I contend, As I'm asham'd to tell it to my Freind. Her. What ever Sorrows have opprest your Heart, Yet since you strove to hide your self by Art From me whom you call Freind, you ought much more That Sin then those Misfortunes to Deplore. Cleo. My Grief from you I will no longer hide, That you may Pity her whom now you Chide; But let us first, Hermione, remove To some such Shady Place as yonder Grove, That when to you my Secret I commit, You scarce may see how much I blush at it. [They goe out Enter Tryphon and Seleucus The Scene Tryphon's Apartment. Sel. Forgive me, Sir, if I presume to say You have appear'd in too much Grief this day, And all last night you took so little Rest As if some Sorrow had your Heart opprest. Try. Alas, Seleucus, I am under, now, Sorrows would make the Strongest Soul to Bow, And I have often for Demetrius sent, That in his Friendship I might give them vent; But since he does not come, and since I know That perfect Friendship which he has for you, Being with Trouble so much overprest, I will commit that Secret to your Breast. Sel. This Favour no addition can admit, Unless, Sir, I may serve you too in it. Try. That Friendship for Demetrius which I have; And which shall never cease but in the Grave, Made me resolve by his Advice to gaine The Syrians Kindness by a gentle Reigne, And since Nicanor's Vertue most does Shine, That I without Reserve might make him Mine, I by Demetrius Councell too was led To raise Nicanor's Daughter to my Bed. Sel. Which of Nicanor's Daughters is it, Sir, That he would have you to your Crown preferr. Try. 'Tis Cleopatra whose Bright Eyes I own Makes her deserve to share the Syrian Throne; You seem to Sigh at what I told you now. Sel. Under your Grief how could I choose but Bow, But under what Affliction can you bend, Having a Crown, that Mistress and, that Friend? Try. Most men with one of those might Happy be, But I am Wretched though I have all three, For Heaven decrees, from whence our Law we take, How much shall every mortall Happy make; And if he does but faile in one of those Desires, which must that Happiness compose, That one Deny'd, though with all th'other Blest, Will rob him of the Gust of all the rest: If I must Love and in Love miss my ends, Fortune in vaine sends me a Crown and Freinds. Sel. Do's Cleopatra your Addresses slight? Try. That shee'le receive them even my Heart does fright; I who Undaunted through such Storms did steer, As the most Brave would tremble but to hear, I who have Kings depos'd, and Battels won, And never any thing like Feare have known, Am now to see my Dearest Freind affraid, And of the Yeildings of a Lovely Maid. Sel. To share your Crown can you esteem her fitt, And yet, Sir, fear that shee'l accept of it? Those words appear a Mistery to me. Try. Seleucus, I'l unvail the mistery; 'Twas yesterday that I Demetrius sent, My Crowne to Cleopatra to present; But 'twas last night alas that I did see A Brighter Beauty which has Conquerd me, Whose Eyes are blest with such a Pow'rfull charm They Burn those Hearts which others can but warm; Till I that Beauty saw, I did believe, A man resolv'd the Law to Love could give. Sel. Why should you, Sir, appear afflicted now, Since 'tis to so much Beauty that you Bow; Love is a Fate which every one must Taste, Some soon, some late, but all must Burn at last. Your Fate you rather should Applaud then Blame, (Since you must Burn) that 'tis in such a Flame. Try. To wear her Chaines, Seleucus, is to Me A Happiness transcending Liberty, Then doe no longer think it is my Love, But 'tis my Friendship does my Torment prove, Since with Demetrius I did once contract, I never yet, in Thought or Word or Act, Yielded to what might it in Question call, But now I feare, Seleucus, that I shall; For while that he by me employ'd has been To Court fair Cleopatra for my Queen, This other Beauty has so Conquer'd me, As without her thy Prince must Wretched be, Which justly my Demetrius will offend: Hard choice when I must wrong my Love or Friend. Sel. Is this, Sir, the Misfortune you Lament? Try. You ask as if Fate could a Worse have sent. Sel. Demetrius would not Merit your Esteem, If that which makes your Joy should Trouble him. Try. Yet that I shall offend him I must Grieve. Sel. Such an Offence as this hee'l soon Forgive. Try. My Grief, (though he forgave it) would not end, 'Tis much to need the Pardon of a Freind. Sel. 'Tis more when Fortune does a Subject bring To such a height as to Forgive his King, That Glory will the heaviest Wrong outweigh. Try. Through all this Darkness I might see some Day, If my Demetrius e're in Love had bin, For then hee'd judge this Change my Fate not Sin: Lovers still pay to Love a deep Respect, And where Love is, Causes excuse th'Effect. Sel. At my request, Sir, banish all your Care, Leave it to me to manage this Affair. Try. Ah if to this thou giv'st a Happy End, Embracing him. Thou hast for ever made thy King thy Freind: 'Tis not enough that he forgives my Sin, He must be still my Friend as he hath been For know I need, my Sorrows to remove, As much his Freindship, as my conquerors Love, Since if to Win the Last I Lose the First, I shall thereby at once be Blest and Curst. [They goe out The End of the second Act</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE THIRD ACT. The Scene an obscure grove. Enter Cleopatra and Hermione. Cleo. Doe not, my Deare Hermione, admire, That to this Gloomy Grove I did retire, Since here I thought I could my Heart Reveal, While the kind Shade my Blushes did Conceal; But now I find I'm in as High a Fright, To tell my Fate in Darkness as in Light: Shame, like the World when it in Chaos lay, Knows not distinction betwixt Night and Day; Ah, judge what are my Troubles, since I fear Their sad Relation from my self to hear. Her. No such Just cause of Grief your Fate can send As, Madam, at this rate to use your Friend; 'Tis by that Pow'rfull Name I beg again, That you'l from me no longer hold your Pain, Perhaps I may the Cause of it remove. Cleo. Oh tell me first, have you been e're in Love. Her. Why, Madam, doe you askâ Cleo. âBecause I know That none can ease my Pain that is not so. Her. I was, but Love to Friendship did submit. Cleo. Ah 'twas not Love, if ought could Conquer it, You lov'd not well, or knew his Pow'r but Ill, That say you were in Love and are not still, The Name of Love for Love it self you took, Since Reall Love can never be forsook: Had yours been True, you might as well have swore You doe not Live as that you Love no more. Her. What you have spoken does, methinks, declare, You to the Pow'r of Love no stranger are; But would you thus reproach me if you knew That what you now condemn I did for you? Cleo. Why did you cease to be in Love for me? Her. By many Proofs I did so clearly see That such a Pleasing Sadness conquer'd you, As I to Love could judge it only due, And since Your Heart and Mine were still so like, I fear'd one Arrow both of us did strike. Cleo. Ah say not that your Heart resembles Mine, Since you once Lov'd and could your Love decline, Nor can I fancy who this Man can be, Whom you could leave yet think could Conquer me. Her. Aretus isâ Cleo. Aretus did your name? Her. And at that word your Face is in a Flame, What Friendship should have done your Blushes doe, They are to me more Kind and Just then you, Why has Hermione been thus abus'd? Cleo. May not one blush that's wrongfully accus'd? Hor. But my Belief on a sure ground is built, I see your Love to him, to me your Guilt, Madam, a Blush, when Love is in the case, Is in Effect the Conscience of the Face: Though in this Secret you my Faith did doubt, Deny it not now I have found it out. Cleo. Too much your Friendship I have Wrong'd and Try'd, My Blushes tell you what my Words deny'd; Alas I fear I for Aretus prove That Fatall State the World does call in Love; Yet doe not, since I did but Hide my Flame, Condemn my Friendship but Commend my Shame: Nor blame me if to you I fear'd to show What of my self I am asham'd to know; But my, Hermione, since you could see That Pow'rfull Passion which has Conquer'd me, Spight of my Care to Cloud it, oh I fear It may to others as to you appear; Should that befall me which so much I dread, Honour and Grief would justly strike me dead. Her. That Fear you ought not, Madam, to admit. Cleo. How did you then come to discover it? Her. That Grief which when retir'd, you still exprest, Made me Suspect what now you have confest, For she who Greives while courted by a King, Shews that such Grief alone from Love can spring; And when I found you Lov'd, I quickly knew, Your Love could be but to Aretus due, Which since you have acknowledg'd, give me leave To aske why Tryphon's Love you did receave; Was not Ambiton in your soul too strong? Cleo. Doe not at once my Love and Virtue wrong For if I had Aretus Passion known I would have valu'd it above a Throne? Her. But now tis known, why is it not embrac'd? Cleo. Because my word was first to Tryphon past. Her. As you my Love, so I your Love must blame, Since you before your Love prefer your Fame. Cleo. I should appear unfit for his Esteem Did I not value more my Word then Him; And this great Pleasure, to my Act is due, That which does lose me him, deserves him too; Ah why did not Aretus let me see, That Passion which you say he has for me, Before my Promise was to Tryphon past? Her. But why to give it did you make such hast? Cleo. I fear'd that he who did my Heart subdue, Would, my Hermione, have seen it too, And I his Love for ever would decline, Rather then he should first discover mine; Twas fitter since I ow'd it to my Fame, To suffer Ruine then to merit Shame; Her. But e're you did admit the Kings Address, Aretus looks did so much Flame express, As sure you could not but his Passion see. Cleo. That's not enough, he should have told it me, But what soe'r his Proofs of Love have been, By me, Dear Friend, alas they were not seen, For I so fear'd that I might act amiss In my own Love that I ne're minded his; Blushes a Womans Passion may reveal, But Men their Passion by their Words should tell. Her. Could he your Love more Generously seek, Then to Deserve it and yet Nothing Speak? Cleo. Rather what more could he have done amiss, Then Lose my Love by so Concealing his? A Love that is at once both Great and Strong, While it doth Bind the Heart, Sets Free the Tongue; And lest that mine should make me Faulty prove, I to my Honour Sacrific'd my Love; So I did fear, his Merit was so Great, That asking Nothing he might All Things get. Her. How cruell is your Vertue or your Fate. Which makes your Love produce th'Effects of Hate? Cleo. Aretus yet more Cruelty does show, That durst Love me, yet durst not tell me for. Her. You doe him Double Wrong, since his Respect You first Mistake, then Punish as Neglect; Such awfull Flames you in his Heart have bred, As he thinks Silence ought his Love to plead, He but defers to Speak what he does feel, Till by his Actions you his Love may tell; And to declare his Passion does delay, Only to show it you the Noblest Way. Cleo. Fatall Delay, the Fatal'st that could be, It loses me to him and him to me; Yet such a High Respect to him I pay, That on My Self I'l Punish his Delay; And since my Promise is to Tryphon made, To Breake it Love it self shall not perswade; That which for me your Friendship made me doe, My Honour makes me now Perform for you; Your Rivall I will never be again. Her. I for Aretus did a Love but feign, That in your Blushes, Madam, I might see What by your Modesty was hid from me; Yet had I lov'd, I'd not that Love pursue, Since you best merit him as he does you; But how can you so Iust to Honour prove, And yet resolve to be Unjust to Love? Ah you much more then he have done amiss, You prize your Word more then your Flame and his, And by a Sacred Bond your self you Tye To him you hate, and him you love you Fly. Cleo. I owe him less then I doe owe my Flame, And fly not from his Love but from my Shame; She to her Honour too Unjust does prove Who dares not value it above her Love; Press me not then to Do what I should Shun, Rather then be Unjust I'l be Undone: Those who are lost while Virtue they pursue In their Destruction find their Comfort too. (They goe out. Enter Demetrius and Seleucus. The Scene Demetrius's Apartment. Sel. Those were the Words which did betwixt us did pass, But I perceive some Sadness in your Face. Dem. My Heart and Face doe then but ill agree, Since nothing could more welcome seem to me. Sel. I cannot guess from whence your Joy should rise, Since Tryphon told me 'twas by your Advice, That he did offer her to be his Queen, And, which is more, that you employ'd had been, To Court her to be Consort to his Throne. Dem. All this and more then this I freely owne, For I not only woo'd her to be Queen, But her Consent to be it I did winn; But why at this, Seleucus, do you start? Sel. Alas what you have said has pierc'd my Heart, Yet from my Friend I'l not my self disguise; The Charming Light of Cleopatra's Eyes Over my Soule the Victory did win, But to herself this has a Secret been; For, my Demetrius, I did judg it fit, Not Words but Service should discover it; That High Respect I did resolve was due To such a Beauty and such a Passion too; Methinks at this which I have spoke you start, I think her Beauties too have pierc'd your Heart. Dem. How can you think for Tryphon I'd appear, If I my self had been in Love with her? Sel. But why should you such Satisfaction show, That he declines what you advis'd him to? Ah sure your Liberty she did surprise, Since first to Court her you did him advise; I see what Beauty has made Tryphon doe, What it has wrought in him it may in you, And what I said such Change in you did move, As I have Cause t'impute it to your Love. Dem. If any Change does in my Looks appear, 'Tis not, I vow, that Im' in Love with her. Sel. Give me then leave there my Address to make. Dem. That's what I cannot Give but you may Take. Sel. Neither for Tryphon nor your self to woo, And yet deny me leave to court her too? I cannot guess what 'tis that you intend. Dem. I were unfit to be Seleucus Friend, Should I act otherwise then now I doe, For he who to one Friend does prove untrue, That he may gaine another Friend's Esteem, Deserves too justly to lose both of them: Though I am yours above what I can say, Yet I must be it too in Honours way; In Friendship every other Tenure's ill, By that mine has been held and shall be still. Sel. Fate ore my hopes another Cloud does send, I'm Rival'd and by one that is your Friend; But may you not acquaint me with his Name, Who is my Fellow Martyr in this Flame? Dem. No I'l be just to both, he shall not know You Rivall him or that he Rivals you; Yet both thus farr shall be oblieg'd to me, From Tryphon's Rivallship I'l set you free: But did he not acquaint you with her Name Who in his Heart has lighted such a Flame? Sel. So vast a Cause of Joy to me it prov'd That he no longer Cleopatra lov'd, As I did not remember to inquire Who this new Passion did in him inspire. Dem. By what he said could you not guess at it? Sel. Ah! he who Cleopatra's Love could quit, The Pow'r of Love forever must forswear, For could he Love, who should he love but her? Sure this new Love is but a Love of State, But he for our return too much may waite. Dem. I long to know to whom he does Submit, As much as he that I'l consent to it. [Exeunt. Enter Nicanor, Stratonice, Aretus and Irene. The Scene Nicanor's Pallace. Ire. Sir that Demetrius may your Pardon winn, That he made Tryphon court her for his Queen, He bad me tell you every way hee'l try To make that Love, which he gave Life to, Dy, And hopes himself this night to let you know He has perform'd what he has promis'd you. Nic. I at this Promise so much Joy admit, As nought can Heighten but his doing it. Stra. What e'r Demetrius hopes yet, Sir, I fear Tryphon will not decline his Love for her. Nic. Demetrius Pow'r with him you know is Great. Stra. The Pow'r of Beauty, Sir, is Greater yet, And though th'Usurper were more fierce and strong, A Family like ours he durst not wrong. Nic. Who dares in Royall Blood his hands imbrue, What is it, after, which he dares not doe? Nor can he think his leaving her a Crime, Since 'tis what we so much desire of him. Stra. Though 'tis what we most wish yet, Sir, you know Since none of us will tell him that 'tis so, 'Twill as a Wrong on us to him appear, And therefore to perform it he will fear, For though Antiochus's Blood he spilt, Yet for a Crown he did contract that Guilt, And by the Wicked nothing can be known Of too High Price, when 'tis to buy a Throne: They will Do All, that they in one may Sit, But Suffer All rather then hazard it. Nic. Yet since Demetrius takes of it the care, I of a good Event would not despair. Stra. I fear th'Usurper will his Sute deny. Nic. Let's not afflict our selves by Prophesy. Are. The Wrath of Heaven must needs that man pursue Who tyrannizes Men and Beauty too. Stra. But though the Punishments from Heaven we know Are alwayes Just, yet they are often Slow. Are. When e'r a Subject does Usurpe a State, Any Brave Hand has Right to act his Fate: The Gods make every Man a Judge of him Who against every Man commits a Crime; And Heav'n permitted him to act this last T'invite us to Revenge all that is past; What more to merit Death could Tryphon do, Then to offend the Crown and Beauty too? Nic: He whom the Gods into the Throne doe call, Should therefore only by their Justice fall. Are. Heaven's Justice Monarchs only should dethrone But Tyrants they abandon to our own; The Right they give us we too much abuse, Hoping they'll Act what we ourselves refuse; The Pow'rs Divine we injure, while we thus Remit to them what they have left to us. Nic. Yet he's to blame who does to Death pursue That Man to whom the Name of King is due. Are. But him with greater Justice we should blame Who as his due usurps that Sacred Name; Since he our lawfull Monarch's Blood has spilt, Who e'r revenges not contracts the Guilt. Nic. If Tryphon by a Private Hand does fall, That Hand wrongs him as much as he wrong'd all; Th'Affronts which are on a whole Nation laid, By that whole Nation ought to be repay'd; It should not by a Single Hand be done. Ar. What's due from All is due from Every one, And since the Syrians doe decline to Pay That Righteous Debt, I that am willing may. Nic. Doe you their Toughts by Silence understand? Ar. Their Silence in this case is their Comand; Who is it at his Reign does not repine That to gain Pow'r kill'd all the Royal Line? Such Usurpation every one does fright. Nic. Where none can Claim, Possession is a Right. Ar. All have more Right, since he those Crimes has done, To Tryphon's Life then he has to the Crown: Fair Cleopatra's Danger calls on us To free her and revenge Antiochus: 'Twere Sin if longer we the cries withstood Of Injur'd Beauty and of Guiltless Blood. Nic. Suspend this Generous Anger till we know What in her Cause Demetrius can doe. Ar. But if Demetrius, Sir, should not prevail. Nic. I then will find a way which shall not fail. Ar. May you not, Sir, discover it to me; Nic. Not till th'Event of this Design I see, Then I engage, if he successles prove, I'l free my Daughter from th'Usurpers Love; Be pleass'd, Sir, to depend on what I say. Ar. What you Command 'tis fit I should Obey. (They goe out. Enter Tryphon, Demetrius, and Seleucus. The Scene Tryphon's Apartment. Try. Though many Proofs you gave that you'r my Friend, Yet this last Proof does all the rest transcend, For you in this have evidently shown That you are more my Friend then you'r your own; Never was any Torment yet above That in which Friendship does contest with Love; But what you now have said has cur'd my Pain. Sel. When of your Fate you did to me complain, I told you from Demetrius you would find A Cure for all th'Affliccions of your Mind. Try. You did, I of his Friendship judg'd amiss, I fear'd twas not what now I find it is; But yet I cannot say that I am more His Friend since this then I was heretofore, My Kindness for you to such Height was grown As it could not admit Accession. â[Embracing Demetrius. Dem. Ah, Sir, those Words which now were spoke by you O're pay all I have done or e're can do, Yet I may say, and not Presumptious be, Some Reparation, Sir, was due to me, Since you could doubt I valu'd any thing Above the Blessing, Sir, to serve my King. Try. That Error to repair, I'le now employ Only your help to place me in my Joy; By such Fair Eyes my Heart has been surpriz'd, As I adore that Passion I despis'd; I who till now Loves Votaries did blame, Find him a God I thought was but a Name: This Heart which has been bred in War and Blood, And all Death's Horrors dauntlesly withstood, Charm'd by Loves Magick trembles with such Fear, As I her Conquest dare not tell to her; Which showes that in her Bright Triumphant Eyes A Fate more to be fear'd, then Dying, lyes; Your Help, my Dear Demetrius, I must Seek, To tell her what to her I dare not speak. Dem. Whatever you Command I must Obey, Yet pardon me if I presume to say, How can she think you to her Eyes submit If you your self, Sir, will not tell her it? Try. Ah in this answer I your Fear perceive, That I'l repeat that Fault you did forgive; No, my first Love was but a Love of State, But this Love is as much my Choice as Fate; She with so strange a Fire my Breast does fill, As I to quench it want the Pow'r and Will. Dem. Permit me then th'Imployment to decline, For since her Beauties with such Lustre Shine, They may wound me, for 'tis a likelier thing She should subdue a Subject then a King. Try. I know the Friendship which you have for me Against her Eyes your Antidote will be. Dem. Yet Vassals, Sir, and Monarchs are alike, When e're the Dart of Love or Death does strike. Try. Let not such Fear your Sacred Friendship blot, Why should you doubt it when I doubt it not? But to confirm you, know you oft have seen Her whom I'd have you court to be my Queen; And since to her Bright Eyes you did not bow Ere I ador'd them, you'l not doe it now; For, my Demetrius, tis her Beauties Right, That who can Love must Love her at first Sight, Nor shall I think, if you th'Imployment wave, You have forgiv'n me as you said you have. Dem. Ah then, Sir, 'tis unfit I struggle more, Tell me that Beauties name which you adore, And all her Charmes, to serve you, I'l despise, This Sir I vow. Try. Her name isâStratonice (Demetrius starts and trembles Why at that Name Tremble you thus and start? Dem. Oh why am I Condemn'd to Act this Part? Alas how can I to that Beauty goe, Whose sister you by me have injur'd so? Who are to one another too so Kind, As Friendship them does more then Nature bind: They are alike concern'd in all they do, And who wrongs one does wrong the other too. Try. These Words have almost made my Joys complete For since their Friendship is so Firm and Great, I shall, presenting Stratonice my Crown, Repair what to her Sister I have done, Who since the Wrong she did by you Endure, 'Tis just she should from You Recieve her Cure. By this a Trebble Gainer you will be, For you'l obliege Yourself, and Her and Me. Dem. Oh Sir, forgive me if I let you know, That 'tis your Love not Reason argues so, For to their Friendship it will give an End, Should she wed him who has so wrong'd her Friend; Honour would make her too the Throne despise To which she by her Sisters Fall must Rise; That Family to visit I'm unfit, Having so much affronted one of it. Try. I wrong but one while I my Love recall, But marrying th'other I obliege them All; That Family will with a Fault dispence, Whose Reparation does exceed th'Offence; 'Twas Interest my first Addres did move, But this Address is the Result of Love; Whatever Fault True Love does make us do, Must carry with th'Offence the Pardon too: On this Oblieging Embassy then goe, And let me to my Friend my Mistress owe; Lay at her Feet at once my Crown and Heart, My Joy depends on th'Acting of your Part. [Demetrius offers to speak. Then Strive no more, since what I ask you now Is what you owe My Friendship and Your Vow; While Stratonice you to my Throne invite, To Cleopatra my Excuse I'l write. (Tryphon goes out. Demetrius stands gazing after him. Seleucus Enters. Sel. You in your Looks have so much trouble shown, As I dare hardly venter you alone; So great and Moving your Disorders be, As I partake in Griefs which I but see. Dem. Alas, I have reciev'd so strange a Blow, As I endure more Grief then I can show. Sel. To my unequall'd Friendship be so just, As to commit your Secret to my Trust; To cure those Sorrows under which you Bend, Imploy the Life and Service of your Friend; Some Fatall Grief does now your Soul surprize, Or you are too in Love with Stratonice, For I perceiv'd, when he pronounc'd her Name, You trembled and your Face was in a Flame. Dem. Admire not at those Sorrows which I show, Since you their Cause at once both ask and know; On me what sharper Curse could Fortune bring, Then make my Rivall be my Friend and King. Sel. Under the like Misfortune I did Bow, And Suffer'd Lately what you Suffer Now; Since his Inconstancy my Pain has Cur'd, Be in my Fortune of your own assur'd. Dem. Who thinks, does know her Beauties Pow'r but ill, That who once Lov'd her will not Love her still. Sel. Doe not by that Belief your Grief Inflame, Of Cleopatra's Eyes I thought the same; His Friendship sure as strong for you will be, As his Inconstancy has been for me. Dem. Have you forgotten what he lately said, 'Twas a State Love he Cleopatra paid. But o're this Love what can the Conquest get, Which makes State Interest resign to it? Than do not think he did your Fear remove By his Inconstancy but by his Love; Our Stars on us with different Influence Shine, What wrought your Cure makes me despair of mine. Sel. Part of your Secrets trusted to my Breast, To serve you, I now beg to know the Rest; You told me Stratonice had Conquer'd you, Now let me know if she does Love you too. Dem. Ah if I were not in that happy State, Why should I thus exclaim against my Fate? Sel. I cannot See, since you are sure of her, Why you the King should as a Rivall fear; Since she does You and Virtue so esteem, She'l value you more then she'l value him. Dem. Her Love to me and Virtue Shine so clear, As 'twere a Sin her Rivallship to fear; No 'tis not that from whence my Sorrows rise, But I, not dreaming he lov'd Stratonice, Am by a Fatall yet a Solemn Vow Ingag'd to Court for him my Mistress now; Should I not doe it I my self Forswear, And doing it I Wrong my Love and her; Never Misfortune did so cruel prove, I must betray my Friend or else my Love; Seleucus, 'tis a Horrid Choice, when I, Rather then either choose, would choose to Dy. Sel. Your Case is hard, it cannot be deny'd, Yet Stratonice's Love is on your side; I against Fortune justlier might repine, For that Fate you deplore I wish were Mine; That Cleopatra's Love might be for me, I would consent he should my Rivall be; But since the King your Passion never knew, And since his Friendship is so firm to you, Hide not from him the Pain that you are in; Friendship o're Love the Victory may win. Dem. Ah if I told him I his Rivall am, And that his Mistress does approve my Flame, Alas a much more likely Way 'twil prove, To Raise his Height then to Suppress his Love; My Flame must therefore be conceal'd by you, Rivals in Love and Friends none ever knew. Sel. My Truth in Such a Secret doe not fear, Tell me the Course that you resolve to Steer, That I in it may usefull be to you. [Demetrius studies a while. Dem. I am resolv'd to Doe what I did Vow, For were I Guilty of so Mean a Thing As to be False both to my Freind and King, And should thereby my End in Love obtain, The Joy would scarce be equall to the Pain; Perhaps she will not be to me Severe, When Sacred Friendship only makes me err, Methinks it were Injustice to suspect, When that's the Cause, that shee'll condemn th'Effect, Sel. While such an Unexampled Act you do, She cannot Blame so much as Pitty you. Dem. To lose her and Deserve her is more fit, Then to Posses her and not Merit it. [They goe out The End of the Third Act</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FOURTH ACT. Stratonice Demetrius and Irene. The Scene Nicanors Pallace. Ire. to Str. Such are the Sorrows he does now endure, As, if You are not, Death will be his Cure. Stra. Those Griefs, Demetrius, which in you I see Contagious prove and have infected me; You are Unkind since you the Cause conceal Of sorrows whose Effect your Looks reveal. Dem. Madam I hop'd you rather would deplor Those Griefs I beare, then load me thus with more, Judge with what Malice Fate does me pursue, Since I'm affraid to tell my Grief to you, To you who only have the Pow'r to Cure Those Matchles Miseries which I endure. Stra. Alas what you have told me now, I find, More then your Silence is to me Unkind, For you lament, and in a high degree, Those Griefs whose Cure you say depends on me: What have I done that you should use me so? Dem. Ah Madam, sure you my Transgression know, Or your Resentments could not be so High, As by such Cruel Words to make me Dye, Which now I humbly begg your leave to doe, Since twice you say I was unkind to you; But for those Words I never could have thought, That my Misfortune did Transcend my Fault, I must Despair your Pardon now to win, My Grief for needing it being judg'd my Sin. Stra. You never my Resentments did provoke But by your Silence and what now you spoke. Dem. Would to the Gods I never had, then I Should but Unhappy and not Guilty Dye, But I alas must by a Fatall Oath Ending my Life contract the Guilt of both, That is my Fate whatever I shall doe. Stra. I feare your Sorrows have Distracted you. Dem. Alas Distraction, Madam, would appear A Happiness compar'd to what I bear, For though the Joys I in your Love Recieve Transcend all those which Heaven to me can give, Yet I those Charming Glories must foregoe, And to my self the Sin thereof must owe. Stra. Demetrius, I believ'd you had a Soul Which could th'approaches of Despair controul. Dem. Condemn not, Madam, the Despair I show, Since Tryphon is Declar'd my Rivall now. Stra. Since this is the Misfortune you deplore, I have more cause to Blame you then before, For could you Grieve at this, did you not fear I would his Crown above your Love preferr? By your first Fault you did but wrong my Love, But this a wrong does to my Vertue prove; Alas what two worse Actions could you doe, Then thus to doubt my Love and Vertue too. Dem. Ah Madam, if you would have heard me out, You would have found that I do neither doubt, For Nothing can to either equall be, But that Misfortune which has fall'n on me; When I thus grieve he does my Rivall prove, I feare his Cruelty, not doubt your Love; But though his Fire for you I must Lament, Yet Fate on me a sharper Curse has sent; For he not knowing I his Rivall am, Imployes me to acquaint you with his Flame; To court you for him I am hither sent And he his Rival makes his Confident. Str. He has more cause to mourn for this then you. Dem. Yet to a Trust Fidelity is due, That Man who can be faithless to his Friend, Though 'tis in Love, deserves to lose his End: Could I but one Unworthy Action do, I should by it forfeit my Right in you, And though you might to Pardon me think fit Yet to my self I ne're could Pardon it. Stra. Heaven this strict Virtue does in you Inspire, Which therefore I Condemn not but Admire; Then with what you did Promise him Comply, But what you ask for Him I'le still Deny; Thus you to Friendship's Duty Just may prove, And I as Faithfull to the Rights of Love. Dem. Oh gods! What is Demetrius's Offence, That you to him so strange a Fate dispence; Your Fiercest Anger could not plague him worse, Then thus to turn his Blessings to his Curse; Your Love and Vertue which should give Releif, But more contributes to Augment my Grief, Yes, Madam, your Inconstancy and Hate Had been to me a less Tormenting Fate, Less Horror I had felt from Deaths Assault Caus'd by my Mistress Justice then my Fault; I'me as Unfortunate as you are Fair. Stra. Alas what causes in you this Despair? Since I have let you know how you might be Just to your Vowes, to Tryphon, and to Me. Dem. 'Tis more then all the World has Pow'r to doe, I must be False to Him or False to You, For not believing he Ador'd your Eyes, I swore a solemn Oath I would despise His Conquerors Charmes to serve him, thus you see I must Forsake you or must Perjur'd be, I know which of the two I ought to doe, 'Tis less to loose then be unfit for you; Heaven which your Merits and my Faults has known Calls me to Death, you to the Syrian Throne; Death is to my Ambitious Passion due Which from the Throne can only hinder you, My Fate I therefore shall Undaunted bear, Since 'tis my Ruine helps to raise you there. Stra. Could I of what you now propose admit, I of that Throne should judge my self Unfit; Tryphon, to gain it, has acquir'd such Hate, As 'tis scarce strong enough to bear his Weight, And to his Guilt if I should add my own, 'Twould be a Certain Way to sinke the Throne. Dem. If with his Pow'r your Virtue you doe mix, Madam, the Throne you would not Sink but Fix; Then what he offers you vouchsafe to take, Both for your own and for your Countries sake. Stra. My Country will deserve those Chaines shee's in, Could she consent to Break them by my Sin. Dem. Your Country cannot charge you with a crime, Since, Madam, I Resign you up to Him. Stra. Resign me up to him! Ah you shall find, That I to Tryphon will not be Resign'd; Now you Pretend to more then you can Do, For you'd Forsake me and Bestow me too; You may, if you think fit, your Love decline, But I, Demetrius, ne're can alter mine. Dem. Ah the more Kindness you to me Express, You still to it Intitle me the less. Stra. I see too clearly what you told me now, And mourn your Sin more then the Losing you; Yet I by Scorning Tryphon will make known, I Value you more then the Syrian Throne; If to your Guilt I so Oblieging prove, Ah judge what I'de have been unto your Love; Farewell, you are the first the World e're knew Who Lov'd his Mistress and Forsook her too. Stratonice and Irene go out. Demetrius gazing after them. Dem. Thus when the Sun from us withdraws his Light, He leaves the World to Horror and to Night; Why to the Throne did Heaven let Tryphon climb And then Revenge on me my Truth to him? Prodigious is my Fate, my Death I find In Friendships being True and Beauty Kind; Oh Gods! to what must I hereafter Trust? Since you Destroy me but for being Just; If you of Virtue onely will Admit, Why am I Ruin'd for pursuing it? [He goes out. Cleopatra and Hermione, Cleopatra holding Tryphon's letter in her hand. The Scene the Garden of Nicanor's Palace. Cleo. To Court and gain my leave his Queen to be, And after dare thus to Abandon me! Th'Affront which he thereby on me would lay, Can only by his Blood be wash'd away. Her. Why should his leaving you your Anger move, Since now you may Accept Aretus Love? That Fatal Promise which eclips'd your Joy Tryphon's Inconstancy does now Destroy. Cleo. I should Aretus Flame too much Abuse, If I gave him what Tryphon does Refuse. Her. Sure, Madam, if you argue at this rate, To lose Aretus is your Choice not Fate. (Enter Aretus. Ar. Madam, I bring before your Justice now One who has been so Criminal to you, As he no longer could deferr to come, And beg he may from you Receive his Doom? He would have free'd you from pronouncing it, But that he did believe it was unfit, Since against you he did commit the Crime, That any but your self should Sentence him; His Sorrow for his Sin must needs be High, Since he himself makes it his Suit to Dye. Cleo. Who e're, Aretus, has Offended me, And then does Grieve for it to such degree, As proves it was not his Design but Fate, Deserves my Pardon rather than my Hate. And since by me he is exempt from Blame, You safely may acquaint me with his Name, And in what 'tis he did so guilty prove. Ar. I am th'Offender and th'Offence is Love, By my Respects to you I Guilty am; 'Tis they alas make me miscal my Flame, For those blest Fires which on your Altar shine Are not more Sacred or more Pure than mine, Judge, Madam, of your Beauties Influence, Which makes me call such Love as this Offence, A Love which does produce so bright a Flame, As nothing can Displease you but the Name. Cleo. Aretus, I'me Amaz'd at what you say. Ar. But yet my Vows to you I durst not pay, Till you to Tryphon gave that Fatal leave, Which show'd you might a Lovers Vows Receive, And since you did not his Address decline, It made me Hope that you might Pardon mine, For he ne're did what a Brave Man should do, Unless it were in Daring to Love you; I would not therefore make my Passion known, While he by his might place you on a Throne, And yet that Throne appear'd for you Unfit, Since such a Tyrant once had sate in it, But now that he your Service has Forsook, I come to beg those Chains which he hath Broke; I would have begg'd I might Revenge you too, But he has done it by Forsaking you; Heaven could on him no Greater Curse have sent For such a Sin than such a Punishment. Cleo. Th'Affront's too Great which he has laid on me, To think his Choice his Punishment should be, But since you say your Love for me is Strong, Prove what you say by Punishing this Wrong; The Tyrants Guard will but in vain Withstand, A rip'ned Vengeance from a Lovers Hand, Ar. Of a more sharp Revenge you well might Boast, Would you give me that Blessing he has Lost, 'Twill be much Worse for him than to be Dead, To see me have what he has Forfeited. Cleo. Aretus hold, while I my self perswade Not to Resent what you so boldly said, And to obtain me, Love would have you do But what your Country's Wrongs do call you to, You can against my just Commands contend, Though Glory be your Way, and Love your End, 'Tis onely I who a fit Judge can prove, In what relates to my Revenge or Love; 'Tis just you knew, since you my Love have sought, The lowest Price at which it can be bought. Cleop. and Herm. go out. Ar. O Love, O Friendship, and O Fatal Vow! To which shall I pay my Obedience now? My Friend has done that which he promis'd me, And I from Tryphon's Rivalship am free, By which my Vow and Friendship ties my Hand, From Acting what my Mistress does command, In Love for ever I must miss my End, Or must be false both to my Oath or Friend; Fortune to me too Tyrannous does prove, Opposing thus my Vertue to my Love, And yet I Merit what I suffer now, Since I could make so criminal a Vow. Demetrius comes in. Heaven, my Demetrius, does you hither send, That you the Torments I am in may end. What I more wish than Life or Fear than Death Does now entirely Hang upon your Breath, For neither those nor ought that I can name Should come in Balance with my Love or Fame. Dem. If I can ease your Pains, you'l do me Wrong If you Suspect they shall Afflict you long; Tell me what Service I must pay you now. Ar. You know you made me make a hasty Vow, That I th'Usurpers Life would not Pursue. Dem. Has he not Done that which I Promis'd you, And from your Mistress does his Love recall? Ar. 'Tis therefore by my Hands that he must Fall. Dem. Rage o're your Reason has the Empire got, You'll kill him when your Rival and when not. Ar. From this Resolve nothing can me Remove, His Life does Rival me as did his Love, For Cleopatra will not mine Admit, Till Tryphon's Death evince the Truth of it; 'Tis therefore by your Friendship that I now Beg you to free me from that Guilty Vow. Dem. That Hate which she for Tryphon doth Express Ought sure to make your Hatred for him Cease, Since Cleopatra Tryphon does abhor Onely because he Rivals you no more. Ar. I find some Reason in what now you say, But I find Greater her Command t'Obey; Since I'de have kill'd him while I did but Fear, That from my Hopes he might have Ravish'd Her, How can I now th'Usurpers Death delay, Since to Obtain her 'tis the certain Way? Heaven which my Sacred Flame for her does know, And that same chiefly made me take that Vow, Pittying that on a Love so free from Guilt The Safety of a Tyrant should be Built, Does, to Repair that Sin it did contract, Ingage me now by Love his Fate to Act, 'Twas fit, as Love made me the Sin commit, So it should free me from the Guilt of it; Since too by Friendship I to it was won, Let Friendship free me from't as Love has done. Dem. Sure such Discourse as this you'de not approve, Did you conferr your Reason with your Love. Ar. Ah this Reproach you cast upon me now Would have been Just when I did make the Vow, A hated Name you for your self will win, Making the killing of a Tyrant sin; Can you then more for an Usurper do, Than for your Friend and for your Country too? Dem. To what you Ask I cannot Condescend, In Kindness to my Country and my Friend. Ar. Alas you'l shew that you abhorr them Both, If you will not absolve me from an Oath, By which your Friend the happiest Man may be, And Syria will from Tyranny be free. Dem. To Grant what you Desire would be so farr, From Ending Tyranny, 'twill Raise a War. Ar. Though I consider War as no small Curse, Yet to be Rul'd by an Usurper's worse. Dem. All would, were Tryphon kill'd, fight for the Throne, 'Tis worse to have Many Tyrants than but One. Ar. If by our Hands they saw this Tyrant fall, 'Twould frighten Usurpation from them all. Dem. The Pow'r so fully Tryphon's Friends engross, As they on us would soon Revenge his Loss, And Syria would such ill by War endure, As the Disease seems easier than the Cure. Ar. Such as to fight for his Revenge would dare, Are people fit to be destroy'd by War. Dem. But by the Pow'r they have so long enjoy'd, They 're likelier to destroy then be destroy'd. Ar. Ah you your self what now you said must blame, Or must think Justice but an empty Name; Who has the Right has on his side the Odds, Else chance does Rule the World and not the Gods. Dem. The Right Antiochus had on his side, And yet alas by Tryphon's Sword he dy'd. Ar. You know that hapless Monarch did not dye By Tryphon's Force but by his Trechery; Those onely then to bear his Yoke are fit Who can Fear ought more than to suffer it; Do not a Guilt so great as this pursue. Dem. I have more Cause to be his Foe than you, For he is fall'n in Love with Stratonice, And me he did into a Vow surprize, Before to me his Conqueress he did name, That I would Help and Serve him in his Flame, By which the Death of Tryphon, you may see, Cannot more Grateful prove to you than me, But my concerns for Syria are above Even those I have for Stratonice's Love, Then doe not Blame me, if I hinder you From Doing what I think is Sin to Doe. Ar. The Justice of the Gods in this you see, He punishes in you your Guilt to me; You Cross my Love and bind me to my Oath, Tryphon alike Revenges me in both; 'Tis Heaven permits him thus to do you Wrong, Because his Death you have delay'd so long. Dem. That Wrong you mention I with Patience take, Since I'me convinc'd it is for Syria's sake; By me be taught to give your Passion Lawes, And Bravely Suffer for your Contry's cause; Farewell, to Sacred Virtue let us trust; The Gods would not be Gods were they not Just. (Demetrius offers to goe out. Aretus drawes his Sword. Ar. Demetrius stay. Dem. Ha! what meane you now? Ar. Since you Deny to free me from my Vow, By which my Hopes of Cleopatra End, And Syria must under a Tyrant Bend, Either of which, too Cleerly you must see, Is worse a thousand times then Death to me, Thus I cast off that Friendship which does prove So Fatall to my Country and my Love; My Death must End the Grief of losing both, Or yours Absolve me from my Guilty Oath. Dem. Put up your Sword, for when this Storm is Laid, You'll Hate your self for what you now have said; Though to your Rage your Friendship you Resign, Yet you shall see nothing can alter mine. Ar. How dare you mention Friendship's Sacred Name And yet Oppose my Country, Love, and Fame? By that Enchanting Word you shall not now That payment Stop which to these three I Owe. Draw or I'll kill thee. Dem. âHeare me but one Word. Ar. I will not hear thee till thou draw'st thy Sword. Dem. Then thus I draw it, but to Heaven I Vow I'l soner Kill my self with it then You. Ar. Thy Guilt to me thy Courage has betray'd, It makes Demetrius now of Death affraid. Dem. When thou reflect'st the King my Rivall is, How by my Oath I have lost Stratonice, And how thy self on whom I did rely Art from my Friend become my Enemy, It may perhaps to thee a Truth appeare, That Death is what I Wish not what I Feare; What I have told thee now I thus make good; [Opening his doublet and spreading his armes. Here quench thy Rage in my unguarded Blood, And in my Death no Grief I shall endure, But that thy Rage not Friendship acts the Cure. (Aretus turns away. Why dost thou turn away? we are Agreed, My Death is what thou Seek'st and what Need. Ar. Oh my Demetrius, that which now you doe Is worse then not to free me from my Vow; For Friendship's sake methinks you should not give Wounds worse then Death, yet after let me Live. Dem. If this appears a cruelty to thee, Then be not Guilty of the like to me. Ar. I but provok'd you to that High Degree To get that Death from you you seek from me. Dem. Such Wounds from You and Fate I now Recieve, As I much rather Death would Take then Give. Ar. I hop'd for me your Friendship was so High, As, when you found Tryphon or I must Dye You then to Kill him your Consent would give, Or let me the Denyal not Survive, But now alas both are refus'd by you. Dem. Ah doe not blame what Honour makes me doe, You know how much Tryphon my Friend has bin. Ar. Call you him Friend who's Guilty of the sin Of Tying you by Oath from Stratonice? Dem. He does not know that he my Rivall is; But, she whom I acquainted with it now, And how I was surpris'd into my Vow, Does Scorn his Passion and Condemn my Crime In being False to her and true to him, For thus she tearmes what my Oath binds me to, By which I am under such Torments now, As if the Gods should but one day deny The Cure I need, the Grief will make me die; So long your Aimes at Tryphons Death suspend, 'Tis but one day and beg'd too by your Friend. Ar. So long I'le respite Justice for your sake, But know, so long I shall be on the Racke. Dem. Heaven Knows, which on us both such Ills has thrown, That I lament Your Sufferings as my Own. They goe out embracing. Enter Tryphon and Nicanor. The Scene Tryphons Pallace. Try. Yes, in my first Address my chiefest End Was by Alliance to make you my Friend, And this Address to the like End does move, But with th'Addition of a Deathless Love; The Bond between us nothing can Undoe, When ty'd by Love and by Alliance too. Nic. That Honor you to Stratonice design Deserves her best Acknowledgments and mine. Try. You then Consent I place her in my Throne. Nic. Sir, it were fit you first Obtain'd her Own, For as by Natures Dictates she is led Not without my Consent her self to Wed. So 'twould in me, Unnaturall appear, Should I without her leave dispose of Her. Try. 'Twould much Advance the Union I pursue, If I could tell her 'tis Approv'd by you. Nic. Too much to me it like Injustice showes T'Approve that Union till I know she Does. Try. You'l make me doubt, your Scruples are so nice, That you on it do set too Low a Price. Nic. No Sir, I doe Esteem it as I ought; Call not my Duty to my Child a Fault. Try. I Know what e'r you Please shee'll alwayes Do, And therefore I'll alike Ascribe to you Those Charming Joy Im her Love shall find, As all my Torments should she prove Unkind; To you, Nicanor, I this Ev'ning give, T'ingage her, my Addresses to receive, But if to be Rejected be my Fate, Know I'l resent it at the Highest Rate. Nic. I'l Rather to a Punishment submit, Then to the Guilt of what may Merit it. (Tryphon and Nicanor goe out severall wayes. Enter Cleopatra and Seleucus. The Scene Nicanors Pallace. Sel. Though Tryphon does to me much Favour show, Yet, Madam, the Respect to you I owe Makes me abhor th'Affront he did to you, And makes me offer to Revenge it too; All men Condemn that which he now hath Done More then they doe his Usurpation; Since it in Reason cannot be deny'd, But that Inconstancy is worse then Pride; Pride oft in Heighthned Souls does it self show, Inconstancy Rules only in the Low, And since your Sex does your own Hand Confine, From Acting your Revenge, accept of mine. Cleo. That Generous Sence you of my Wrongs doe show, And the Brave Offer which you make me now, Joyn'd with that Friendship which I alwayes see You have both for Nicanor and for me, Makes me believe I should Unjustly doe, If I in ought could hide my Greif from you; Know then my Wrongs to me so Weighty seem, As I am Rack'd till I'm Reveng'd on him; And know that no Revenge can Grateful be, But one as Vast as is the Injury. Sel. Will you not judge that our Deposing him Is a Revenge proportion'd to his Crime? Cleo. Ah talk not of deposing him, you know That's less then what you to your Country owe, For Syria's Wrongs and mine will you pursue A less Revenge then is to either due? And for those Sins which he has Done before, Will you Restraine him but from Doing more? Sel. Tryphon will find, since he in Crimes was bred, That such Restraint is worse then to be Dead; To one Depos'd what Sentence can you give So Cruel as Condemning him to Live; Some Generous men who did that Fate endure, To shun the shame in Death have Sought the Cure. Cleo. A Generous man, Seleucus, I will owne, Finds Death an Ease when he has lost his Throne; But he whose Soul is Low, and Crimes are High, Thinks it the Greatest Punishment to Dye; And that Revenge has still the Sharpest bin, Which is held such by him who did the Sin. Ah for my Wrongs there's no Revenge seems Good That is not written in th'Offenders Blood; In all else you Propose you Lose your Breath, And to Obliege me you must act his Death. Sel. If nothing else your Anger can atone, Madam, depend upon't, it shall be Done; But 'tis a Deed so Daring and Sublime, That to Perform it will require some time; Though I his Guards command, I dare not yet Trust them with things so Dangerous and Great. Cleo. To Dangerous Acts the Brave should alwayes run, Those must not be Consulted of but Done; A Tyrants Pow'r still on his Life depends, Who cuts it off cuts off with it his Friends; But that you may this Deed the boldlier doe, My Secrets I will now Disclose to you. Aretus who your Friendship does Possess, And who is Gallant ev'n to an Excess, Courts my Affection to a High Degree, And I must Blushing say is Own'd by me; In my Revenge him I engag'd of late, He shall joyn with you to Act Tryphons Fate, Which by th'Usurper cannot be declin'd, When two such Men his Ruine have design'd; But some Disorders in your Looks I see. Sel. What have you Trusted any one but Me? I am perplex'd that you Revenge Design, And yet make use of any Arm but Mine. Cleo. Into new Griefs me my Revenge had Thrown, If I had ow'd so Great a Debt to one, I therefore chuse to share it betwixt two, Love does in him what Friendship does in you. Sel. Yes, to Aretus, Madam, I'l be Just, He does Deserve this Honour and this Trust; Wee'l both Consult which is the surest Way, In this Great Work your Orders to Obey. Cleo. This Favour no Addition can admit, But by Celerity in Doing it, Since while my Just Revenge you both defer, I feel those Pains which Tryphon ought to bear. [Cleopatra goes out. Seleucus alone. O Prodigy of Fate! I hither came T'Acquaint Fair Cleopatra with my Flame, And scarce could doubt but I should Happy prove, Since I through her Revenge did Court her Love; But e'r my Heart I at her Feet could lay, She tels me she has giv'n her Own away, Nay more in her Revenge shee'd have me Joyn With him who most of all does Merit Mine: Never was any Lovers Fate so hard, The Danger I must Share, not the Reward; Was it her Ignorance or else her Art, Thus to accept my Hand but not my Heart? Aretus hitherto has been my Friend, But Love now to that Name does give an End. And to Obtain her he shall quickly see He must not only Tryphon Kill but Me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIFTH ACT. The Scene is Nicanors Pallace. The Scene opens. Tryphon Demetrius Stratonice and Irene. Demetrius from behind Tryphon fixes his Eyes on Stratonice, folds his Armes the one Within the other, Sighs and goes out still gazing on her. Try. Nicanor and Demetrius having been Imploy'd by me to Court you for my Queen, And having found by both that my Address Has not obtain'd the much desir'd Success; I now am Come, Madam, to wait on you, To pay that Love which to your Beautie's due. A Love which 'twere Injustice to despise, Since 'tis the pow'rful Influence of your Eyes. Stra. That Love which now is offer'd me by you Is, Sir, to Cleopatra only due; Th'Injustice then much Greater would appear, Should I usurp that which belongs to her; Then doe not, Sir, Sollicit me to do A Wrong to Nature and to Justice too; T'were Sin if such Desires were not deny'd. Try. Nature and Justice both are on my side; Where Nature does most Liberally bestow The Charmes of Beauty, there our Loves we Owe, And I the Rules of Justice but pursue, Paying a Debt where Nature showes 'tis due. Stra. Since your first Love you did to her afford, Justice oblieges you to keep your Word; And to my Sister, Sir, I am Confin'd, By Natures Law to be both Just and kind. Thus, Sir, the Right is on my side you see, Fancy does Govern you but Reason me; Try. Such Cruel Words ought not from you to fall, What you term Fancy I must Duty Call; If you I first had seen, then her Ador'd, By you most Justly I had been abhor'd, But you being seen, I should my self abhor, If after I Your Sister could Adore; Your Justice into question will be brought, If my Misfortune should be call'd my Fault; Madam, it must be, sure, some other thing Which makes you at this rate to use your King; And from his Proffer'd Throne thus to Retire, A Glory to which all but you Aspire. Stra. She does not Merit to a Throne to Clime, Who does acquire that Glory by a Crime; To be a Quen I would not wound my Fame. Try. Your only Crime is that you slight my Flame, A Flame which, if by you Contemn'd it be, Shall Ruine others as 'twill Ruine me. Madam, take heed of being thus unkind, Least you your Iudge should in your Lover find. Stra. Nothing can me to Unjust Actions move, Nor will I, Sir, be threatned into Love. Ah if true Love e'r in your Heart had Raign'd, You would have known mine could not be Constrain'd; Under Heav'ns Care Love above Life does stand, Tyrants may Life but cannot Love Command; Act what you said to me, t'will easier prove T'indure your Sentence then indure your Love. Try. Mistake not what your Scorn forc'd me to say, For to your Beauties such Respect I pay, I'd Kill my self sooner then threaten you, But with Revenge Nicanor I'l Pursue; He to my Love, when told him, was unkind, And then I fear'd th'Effects which now I find. Stra. This Menace is beyond your first severe, You Threaten now what only I can feare, But Feare to Love was never yet the Way. Try. I must not Credit that which now you say, For of Loves Theory so much you show, Stratonice seems disordered. As I believe the Practick too you know; This is a Truth your blushes now have shown, Nor could you scorne my Passion and my Throne, Had not some other prepossest your Heart; To find him out I'l use my Pow'r and Art, And, Madam, then it will perhaps appear, You can for him as for Nicanor fear; I am now certain you a Lover have, Him and my hopes I'l bury in one Grave; For since you make me Wretched, you shall know I have the Pow'r to make you Wretched too, And though my Rival might escape my Hand, Yet still your Father's Life's at my Command, Which he shall Lose, if by to morrow night You value not that Love which now you slight. Stra. Yes, Tyrant, thy Resentments more to move I will Confess to thee I am in Love. But yet to thee the Man shall ne'r be known For whom I scorn thy Passion and thy Throne; Act then thy Menaces that thou mayst see, I too am more in Love with Death then thee; To those who feel such Cruelties as these Dying is not a Punishment but ease. Try. Know that to Morrow Night's the utmost date Given to Nicanor's Life or to thy Hate. Stra. To Morrow Night In both it shall appear, Who feares not Death does not a Tyrant fear. [Exeunt severally. Enter Seleucus Alone. The Scene is the Garden of Tryphons Pallace. Oh whether by my Passion am I Led? My Love should die after my Hopes are dead; She has her self declar'd to me that she Has given to him that which is sought by me, Nor is Aretus guilty of the Crime, He does to me what I'd have done to him; Because in Love I cannot reach my End, Why should Revenge deprive me of my Friend? Great Gods! how can I prove so Cold and tame, As on a Rivall to bestow that Name? And while Aretus does my Joyes Ingross, Talke my self into Patience for my loss. Since Friendship thus does plead for my Disgrace, Revenge do thou ascend and take the place; Thou more like Virtue dost to me appear Then Friendship can, in this Affront I bear; Since to the Brave nothing should be above Revenge in Wrongs or Constancy in Love; Therefore thy Death, proud Rivall, Ile pursue, If I must Loose her, thou must Loose her too. [Tryphon comes in to him. Try. Seleucus, now I feel a Matchless Paine, My Perfect Love Meets with the like Disdaine; 'Twixt what her Beautie and her Scorn does doe, At once I Hate her and Adore her too; Ah when Provok'd by what to me she said I Menac'd her to take Nicanor's Head, So Bravely she the threatning did Despise, Her Spirit I Admire above her Eyes: Thus what I thought the speediest Way might be To Conquer her, has the more Conquer'd me; For to my Bondage I am now Confin'd, Both by the Lustre of her Eyes and Mind, But that which does my Highest Torment prove Is, She Confest to me she was in Love, And proudly said twas past my Pow'r and Art To find him out to whom she gave her heart. Sel. This and the scorn which you from her Indure Should make you to your Reason owe your Cure. Try. To one in Love do not of Reason speake, For Love is never strong till Reason's weake; My Passion is so Pow'rfull and so High, As if I miss Enjoying her I Die; But if by thy Assistance she be won, Thou shalt with her devide my Heart and Crown. Sel. Wealth is a thing I never did regard, To have your Favour is the best Reward, Which I'l deserve since, Sir, to reach your Ends I will expose my Mistress and my Friends; Yes, Sir, to me alone, you now will know, That both your Life and Mistress you shall owe, Then summon all your Fortitude to hear That which at once will wound your Heart and Ear; Our Fortunes, Sir, with the like Malice move, You Love one Sister, I the other Love; You have a Rivall who her Heart has wonne, To me my Rivall the like Wrong has done; But that at which we justly should repine, Your Friend's your Rivall and my Friend is mine, Try. What Friend of mine can dare affront me thus. Sel. That name you give but to Demetrius. Try. Oh Gods! what Horrors does my Soul invade? Scorn'd by my Mistress, by my Friend betray'd? This fatal Secret who disclos'd to thee? Sel. 'Twas he himself that open'd it to me. Try. From me conceale it, and yet tell it you? Can I believe Demetrius is untrue, Oh do not take this way t'Usurp his Place. Sel. He durst not tell you he your Rival was, But had you mark'd those Horrors he was in, When him you prest to court her for your Queen, You could not have been doubtfull of his Crime, Your Eyes had told you what I learn'd from him. Try. 'Tis true his Troubles as it were above What any Passion could produce but Love. My Error and thy Faithfulness I see; Ah since Demetrius proves so false to me, Sure 'tis he too that doth my Life pursue. Sel. No, Sir, that Guilt is to Aretus due, With me he Cleopatra does Adore, Who does so much your Leaving her Abhorr, That she has made my Rivall promise her, Charm'd by Loves Pow'r to be your Murtherer; She ny'd my help in the Designe to win, But, Sir, I did detest so base a Sin. Try. Thou art my Genius, and I owe to thee All that I am, and all I hope to be, Though Cleopatra's Guilt be rais'd so high That, with Aretus, she deserves to Dye, Yet if she'll marry thee I'le pardon her, But I one hour will not his Death defer. Sel. This favour tyes me, while I live, to you, But, Sir, in your own case what will you doe? Try. In that, Seleucus, I am doubtfull yet, For on each side the difficultie's great; I look with Horror on Demetrius guilt, Yet tremble to pluck down what I have built; Friendship and Love so in my Bosome strive, As I yet know not which shall there survive; I now am under an unheard of Fate, My Friend and Mistress I both Love and Hate; Ah would Aretus all my Blood had spilt, That against either I might shun the Guilt; In this sad freight I'de be advis'd by thee. Sel. The Resolution easy seems to me, For to your Love if you can give an End, You ought to pardon and make blest your Friend; But if your Being to your Love you tye, Then there's no doubt Demetrius, Sir, must Dye. Try. But if my Love while guiltless was deny'd, I doubt when in her Lovers Blood tis dy'd, That Cruelty may more her Hatred move. Sel. Yet 'tis a Cruelty produc'd by Love; When by your Pow'r you make her be your Wife, And when your Mercy spares her Fathers Life, Both those joyn'd with the Charming Name of Queen Over her Hate the Victory may win; But if; when she's you Wife her Hate endures, The Trouble, Sir, will be more hers then yours. Try. But since, when but to fright her I did say That I Nicanor's Life would take away, She told me to her Death she too would fly; I feare if I should make her Lover Dye, She in dispair to her own Death would run. Sel. Killing one's self is sooner said then done, But if to him that Proof of Love shee'd give, Think not shee'l marry you while he does live. Try. Ha! what thou say'st admits of noe reply, And does on Love bestow the Victory: Those Words have torn Demetrius from my Mind, And for his Death the Orders they have sign'd; He and Aretus instantly shall Dye; Prepare the Guards with speed and secrecy; Thy Care of me has made me judge it fitt To thee this Execution to commit. (They goe out severall wayes. The Scene of Nicanor's Pallace opens. Nicanor, Aretus, Demetrius. Cleopatra and Stratonice both weeping Stra. Yes Sir, I scorn'd his Love and Anger too, Till he with speedy Death did threaten you, My Constancy he then did more than fright, Yet I conceal'd my Terrors from his fight; But, Sir, my Eyes, as soon as he was gone, Wept as my Heart, while he was here, had done; For if to morrow night I'm not his Wife, He has declar'd hee'll take away your Life. Nic. I'l rather to his Rage submit my Head, Than yield that you should such a Tyrant wed, I'l sooner Die then I'l that Union see, Such Hate I have for him such Love for thee. Are. to Cleo. From your Fair eyes those Tears you ought to wipe, This Crime for Heavens Revenge makes Tryphon ripe, So ripe that through his Guards along I'l goe To pay that Death which to his Guilt we owe; The Danger does less then the Duty seem, I'l dry your Tears or strive to merit them. Dem. to Stra. I thought by Loue he would your heart have won, And therefore I did yield to be undone; But since to this vile way he hath recourse, 'Tis just to end such Tyranny by Force; I'l now with much less Grief his Death pursue, Then I resign'd to him my claim to you. Ar. Since we to kill the Tyrant are agreed, I see the Gods his Ruine have decreed. Nic. Though that is just which is designed by you, Yet Just things we should doe as Wise men doe; Seleucus who th'Usurpers Guards commands, When this new Tyranny he understands, To join with us I hope may soon be won. Cleo. I dare assure you 'tis already done. Nic. Already done! by whom? Cleo. âtis done by me; His Hate to Tryphon and his Tyranny Is such, as I am sure in this Designe He will with you, when you desire it, joyn. Are. Whoever does to Virtue but pretend, To what we have resolv'd must be a Friend. Enter Irene hastily Ire. I on your privacies would not intrude, Did not my duty force me to be rude. Some of the Servants from the Garden call, To tell you many soldiers scale the Wall, Arm'd for a Fight they every one appeare, And all of them do Tryphon's Livery weare. Hermione running in. Herm. Seleucus is into your Pallace come, And does with Tryphon's Guards fill every Room. Nica. What may this Meane? Her. My Eyes are much mistooke. If Rage and Horror dwels not in his Look. Seleu, Yeild up your Swords, in vain you'l fight or fly. Aret. Betray'd! then let us acting our Revenges die. Seleucus forces open the doores, he runs in with several of the guards Nicanor Aretus and Demetrius draw their Swords, but ere they can make use of them, are opprest by Number and are disarm'd, Seleucus beckons to the Guards to retire, while they are going out Seleucus sayes. Secure the Pallace Guards, if you Admit Any t'escape, your Lives shall pay for it, These orders read will let you understand, That what I doe is by my Kings command; he gives the orders to Nicanor. You are my Prisoners all, Aretus you Must bear the Fate which to your Sin is due, For you the Murther of the King did plot. Aret. I Merit Death because I kill'd him not. Seleu. Demetrius too the like hard Fate must prove; He does not only Rival Tryphon's Love, But knew Aretus did his Death intend, And yet Conceal'd it to preserve his Friend. Deme. Perfidious man, the Tyrant could not be Told that he was my Rival but by thee. Seleu. Madam, the King in hope that you'l receive His Love, does yet Nicanor's Life reprieve. Nica. Since these two generous Friends are doom'd to Die, Sparing of me is but his Cruelty. Stra. Who would the loss of so much Worth survive, Or by A Tyrant's Mercy who would Live? Death is then either Welcomer to me. Seleu. to Cleo. Here Prostrate, Madam, at your Feet you see One who long since has paid to you his Heart, And who by Love is forc'd to act this part; For when I came to tell you of the Fire Which your Bright Eyes did in my Soul inspire, And, that it might more acceptable be Did offer to revenge your injury, You, e'r I could make you my great Request, Told me Aretus Raign'd within your Breast; Ah! When I found that he was Monarch there, I did, Compell'd by Love and by Dispair, Discover all to Tryphon with Design Helping his Love to make him further mine; This, Madam, you may Look on as my Sin, But what you think my Guilt I Glory in; For what more fully could my Passion prove Then sacrificing of my Friends to Love. Are. Since Love makes no man Cruel or Unjust, That which thou call'st thy Love is but thy Lust. Cleo. Seleucus, I have Listned unto you At once with Horror and with Pitty too, Horror that you this Falshood could Commit, Pitty that Love seduc'd you into it; Ah! to my Love what wrong could be so high, As thinking 'twould be woon by Treachery? No, No, though my affection for you were Such as for me you would have yours appear, Yet Honor, which of all things most I rate, Would by this Falshood turn that Love to Hate; And could I be obtain'd by what you doe, That Crime would soon worke the like Change in you; Oh doe not think that Love can ere be built On such a false foundation as your Guilt. Seleu. In my sad case what could I else have done? To me you'r lost, or this way must be wonne. Cleo. This way be Won! Oh Gods let me not see That you can have so Low a thought of me; For then I'l rather my own Death Pursue, Then owe the saving of our Lives to you; I would have had you to my Love pretend By ways which were proportion'd to the End, And would have had you, though your Hopes were Crost, Yet to have Merited what you have Lost; More Grief in such Revenge I might then find, Then in this mean one you have now design'd; For where true Honor in a Soul does Raigne, To be ingratefull is the fowlest Staine, And she must in her Breast feel more Remorse That is orecome by Merit then by Force. Seleu. Merit would have but plaid a Hopeless part, When he by Inclination had your Heart; Madam it would have much encreast my woe To have Deserv'd you and have Lost you too. Cleo. And yet both these had been an Easier Fate Then not to Merit me and Merit Hate; Ah! when you thought that he my Heart had won By that which you call Incination, You then should by Desert and not Despaire Have cast him thence and fixt Seleucus there, This might perhaps have been perform'd by you, Had you reveng'd my Wrongs and Syria's too; And this Perhaps though Late may yet be done. Sel. Ah, Madam, I to your Revenge will run, If you to me will now a Promise give, That when 'tis acted you'l my Love receive. Cleo. Ah Run not thus into another Fault, Love would not be what tis could it be bought. Are. Why Madam should he now rewarded be For doing that from which he hinders me? Pay not so high a price for our Repreive. Cleo. My Love, Aretus, is my own to give. Aret. Yet to your Love give him not a pretence By that which cannot wash off his Offence. Cleo. Death would to me, Seleucus, happier prove Then if I made a Bargain for my Love. Seleu. Madam, I beg that it your Gift might be. Cleo. Doing your Duty you should trust to me. Stra. Alass why should you her Unkindness dread, When so much Merit on your side shall plead? Nic. Consider, should you run your Fatal way, The present Times and Times to come will say, Because Seleucus in his Love had fail'd, He on his Country Tyrannie Intayl'd, A Sin so black t'were better to submit To slighted Love, then bear the Guilt of it. Cleo. But though to sell my Love I do abhorr, She offers to kneel and he hinders her. Yet on my knees your Virtue I Implore. To free your Country and remove our Fears, And to those Pray'rs behold I add these Tears, [She weeps. Since t'was your Love forc'd you to doe these Wrongs. This Reparation to your Love belongs Seleucus Muses a while gazing on Cleopatra. Seleu. Love still with a resistless Power appears, When Beauty Pleads the Cause and speaks in Tears; The fiercest storms which over Souls has Pow'r Cannot but be supprest by such a Show'r; I Can no Longer my hard Temper keep, 'Tis less to Loose you then thus make you weep; In you and in my Services I'l trust, They shall be Great, and you I know are Just; Thus Clouds a while may the Suns Light Confine, But when they Vanish it does brighter shine. Sel. to Are. Now brave Aretus wee'l together prove Who has the Highest Title to her Love. Are. When of most Merit you can truly boast, Then I deserve she should to me be Lost. Dem. to Stra. Madam your Wrongs call me with them to go, So does the Duty I to Syria Owe. Sel. Then against Tryphon Let us all declare; The Guards which I have brought my Creatures are, And I even Long till I his Blood have spilt, The Victim due both to my Love and Guilt; We must this Moment kill him by surprise, Our Safety now in Expedion Lies. Nica. Deme. Aret. and Seleucus goes out. Cleo. Sure 'tis the Gods that thus their Hearts Incline. Stra. And may the Gods smile too on their designe. Cleo. to Hermione and Irene. You both must to the Tyrants Pallace go, And Let us hourly all that Passes know. Cleopatra, Stratonice, Hermione and Irene goe out. The Scene is Tryphons Pallace. Tryphon alone. Demetrius Knowes 'ere now that tis a thing, Too bold to be a Rival to a King, And in his Ruine Stratonice shall see Nothing is dearer then her Love to me, Nor dare Nicanor my Address detest, Whn by such Proofe he finds I'm not in Jest; Aretus still so proud A heart did show, As I long ow'd him what I pay him now; My faithfull Freed Man Arcas I have sent, Sooner to learn of my Revenge th'Event. Arcas Runs in hastily and affrighted. Arcas, Sir you are lost. Try. What makes thee so affraid? Ar. Oh Sir, you by Seleucus are Betray'd. Try. This News my Soul do's with Amazement fill. Arcas, He's Joyn'd with those whom he was sent to kill? My hast hath almost robb'd me of my Breath, And, Sir, with them your Guards conspire your Death; The People too call for your head aloud, And to those Traitors in whole troops they croud. Try. Arcas, who told this fatal news to thee? Ar. Sir what I tell you I my self did see, And through the streets they March'd at such a rate, As they must now be near the Pallace Gate, Which is abandon'd, Sir, by all the Guards, Brib'd by Seleucus Arts or his Rewards; If you would fly, you should not loose your time. Try. Death's but a Punishment, but Flight a Crime, I'l rather Loose my Life then they shall see That ought which they can do can frighten me; The name of King by no base act I'l Blot, Nor Dying loose the Fame my Life has got. Arcas, Were but these Words, Sir, to the Syrians known, They yet would grant that you deserve the Throne; To me they seem so Generous and High, That fighting by your side I mean to Die. Try. Dost thou then think I will with Traytors fight? Ar. Sir you disdain to save your self by Flight. Try. But who like me a Kingdom did Command, Should scorn to Die by any Subjects hand; No, No, he Merits not to fill a Throne Who when Fate calls, dares not imploy his own; 'Twould be the Traytors Glory as their Guilt, If they could say that they my Blood had spilt: Go watch their coming in the outward Roome, And, when they Enter, say aloud they Come; Mean while for such a Death I will prepare, As shall Deserve thy kindness and thy care. Arcas stays weeping and fixes his eyes on Tryphon. Will Arcas then my last Request deny? Ar. Sir I but begg that I with you may Dye. Try. They will surprise me by this fond delay. Arc. Since you will have it so I must obey. [Arcas goes out. Try. This turn I owe to Cleopatra's Eyes; Yet since I am depriv'd of Stratonice, My Death which they united do conspire, Is not my Fear but that which I Desire. Tryphon goes to an elevated place like a Throne, seats himself in it, then draws a Ponyard, and viewing it saith, My Hand is yet of this Bright Scepter sure, Which for my Sufferings is a Certain Cure: Thus arm'd I will my Enemies outbrave, And, spight of Fate, deserve a Glorious Grave. Ah Stratonice, if thou my Heart couldst see, Thou'dst find I only grieve at losing thee; Such Charmes are in thine Eyes. (Arcas cryes within. Arcas They come, they come. Tryphon rises lifting up his Hand with the Ponyard in it. Try. Then I no longer will deferr my Doom. Nicanor, Demetrius, Aretus, Seleucus rush in with their Swords drawn, followed by the Guards; All make a stand seeing Tryphon in that Posture. Though of my Death your Treacheries may boast, The Triumph yet of your Revenge is lost; Since Heaven designs this my last hour shall be, Thus I my self act what the Gods decree: (Stabs himself. Pleas'd that my Fate within my own Pow'r lyes, And that in Death I can my foes despise; I dye content, since my last breath can boast, That I your Plot of Murth'ring me have crost. Tryphon dyes. Nic. The Tyrant with himself has been at strife To make his Death as Guilty as his Life. Dem. 'Twas Just this Execution he should doe, That as he wrong'd us he may right us too. Are. Yet I must Grieve at that which all Rejoyce, Death should have been his Punishment, not Choice. Sel. His thirst of Humane Blood so great was growne, As he, rather then spare it spilt his owne. One of the Guard leads in Arcas bound. Guard, Arcas confesses 'twas he cry'd they come. Arc. I do expect, but doe not Fear your Doom. Dem. Let him in safety to his Country goe. Are. For our Revenge this Object is too low. Sel. See how he shakes, Guard let him be unbound. Nic. We should prize Faithfulness where e'r 'tis found. The Guard unbind Arcas. Are. To show I merit what I now enjoy, The Freedome you bestow I thus imploy. Arcas runs to Tryphon, takes the Bloody Poniard which lay by him, and with it stabs himself. That Death you thought I fear'd, I run to meet And dye content since at-my-Mastersâfeet [He fals dead at Tryphons feet. Nic. Arcas deserv'd, who could so bravely Doe, A better Fate and better Master too. Are. Tryphon deserved his Gratitude to have, Him he did free and all the rest enslave. Sel. Arcas I wrong'd thinking he shook for Feare. Enter Cleopatra, Stratonice, Hermione and Irene. Cleo. The news of Tryphon's Death hath brought us here, We heard that he by his own Hand did Dye. Sel. See where he now Pale as his Guilt does lye. (They all goe towards the dead Body. Cleo. This sight at once my Joy and Grief does raise. Stra. 'Tis an ignoble Triumph thus to gaze, Sir, let his Body be from hence convey'd; He by his Death for all his Crimes has paid. Sel. Since by the Justice done by Tryphons Hand The Throne of Syria does now empty stand, And since the Tyrant, to confirm his sway, The Royall Line at once did make away, Princes, 'twere for we instantly agreed, Who is the Worthiest Person to succeed, And, since his Merit only can pretend, I judge Nicanor should the Throne ascend. Dem. Seleucus you my motion but prevent. Are. I to what both propose with Joy consent, To you alone the Syrian Crown is due. Nic. Excuse me, Sir, it does belong to you. Nicanor kneels to Aretus Admire not that my self I prostrate thus, Since now I kneel before Antiochus: (They all start and seem amazed. Preserv'd by Heaven from Tryphons bloody Pow'r, To all the blessings of this glorious Hour; Your Father, Sir, who found he did designe [Are. takes Nica. up. T'Usurp the Crown and kill the Royall Line, Sent you that night by a safe hand to me, Hoping that I shut up in privacy, (For when the King revoak'd the Generals place I in Retirement mourn'd out my Disgrace) Might best protect you from the Tyrants Rage; This noble Trust did all my Griefs asswage. Dem. 'Twas a high Proof that he your Virtue knew, Since whil'st he Wrong'd you he did trust you too. Nic. Out of my House but still within my Care You by the Gods till now protected were, Under the name of Zeno's son you went, The Prince by whom you first to me were sent, Who when your Father and the King was kill'd, O'recome by Greif his Life to Death did yeild; In reading this short Letter, Sir, you'll know, Why what you are till now I durst not show. He gives Aretus a Letter. Aretus reads. Antiochus to Nicanor. Since Heaven this Ruine throwes on us, I trust you with Antiochus; Let him by you with Care be bred, But till you see the Tyrant dead, (Oh I conjure you grant me this) Let not himself know who he is, Th'Affront my Father cast on you forgive, And let me still in your Remembrance live. ANTIOCHUS. Aretus gives the Letter to Demetrius and Seleucus. Sel. If 'tis the Prince's hand, the hand I know, It is his writing; Dem. His subscription too. Nic. My Testimony were enough alone, Since I thereby doe lose the Syrian Throne, To which by all your Votes you would me bring. Sel. We all acknowledge that you are our King. Are. Though a lost Crown the Gods to me restore, Two things there are which yet I value more; Oh would to Heaven, Seleucus, that I knew How to be just both to my Love and you. Sel. Under such loads of Guilt my self I find, That I though forc'd by Love your Death design'd, As I the Greatest Sufferings ought to bear, And therefore yield t'indure the loss of Her; A hopeless Love to the best End I bring, Pleasing by it my Mistress and my King; Bless'd if the Sin caus'd by my Love and Fate By this Atonement I can expiate. Are. This Generous Act which now you for me doe Does both obliege me and Amaze me too. (Embracing him. To Cleo. Now, Madam, I dare humbly beg of you To take that Heart which to your Eyes is due, They make me know that 'tis a greater thing, To be a Captive then to be their King; A King who does as his chief Glory own The Power of laying at your feet a Crown; In taking it you'l Raise his Joys above All things except your Beauty and his Love; Nicanor who to me does Empire give, I hope will yield that you should let me Live, Which I shall not till I your Pleasure know. Nic. That Duty, Sir, she to her King does owe. Cleo. That Love for which so Generously you sue, I give not to your Title but to you. Are. Though from your Father I receive a Throne, Yet now you give me more then he has done; Amidst these Joys which Heaven on me does send, I dare not be Unmindful of my Friend; Demetrius, Sir, Adores Fair Stratonice. Nic. Sir, I with Joy consent that she be his. Dem. to Stra. Madam, so Guilty I have been to you, That I scarce dare for your Forgiveness Sue, Mercy it self but rarely does bestow At the same time Rewards and Pardons too. Stra. to Dem. Since what you did, Honor did lead you to, Love shall forgive what Honor made you doe; And since your Guilt I thus have took away, Tis fit that I Nicanor should Obey. Dem. None by Excess of Joy can Death receive, Since after this which you have done I live. Are. to Nic. Sir, I have now but one Request to make, 'Tis that the General's Place you now will take, This is the Lowest Reparation due, For that affront the King did caston you. Nic. Since I have liv'd to Place you in the Throne, The only Duty made me Live is Done. Besides a Solemn Oath I once did swear, That I would never Publick Office bear; Think how Seleucus, Sir, Oblig'd may be, You have already done too much for me. Ar. Then for Seleucus I that place Design, To which all Tryphon's Forfeitures I joyn; 'Tis just since all our Lives to you we owe, That you should have the Pow'r to guard them too. Sel. These Gifts not for their Greatness I esteem, But that the Evidence of trust they seem: Are. to Nic. Is there then nothing in my Pow'r to doe, Which, Sir, may show my Gratitude to you. Nic. You've given me all the Honor I desir'd: Are. You for your self a Nobler have acquir'd. The Way in which me to the Throne you bring, Is Greater then to be your self a King. Now let us to the Gods Oblations pay, For all the Blessings of this Glorious day: To them a Double Debt from me is due, Much for my Crown I owe them, more for You. (Taking Cleo by the Hand. The Curtain falls</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. Your dealing, we confess, is very faire; You paid your Money e'r you saw our Ware, And if you should dislike it now 'tis seen, I pray how would you get it back again? Since never yet at Law an Action lay For Money paid to see a Cry'd-down-Play; Then whatsoe'r it be, dispraise it not, But doe as some when they a Clap have got; Commend the Wench that more to her may goe, Thus if they Jeer you, you may jeer them too; New Playes, like Wives, are subject to the curse Of being took for better or for worse.</field>
