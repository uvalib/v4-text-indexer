      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Gaspero, and Melitus. Mel. Sir, you'r the very friend I wish'd to meet with, I have a large discourse invites your eare To be an Auditor. Gas. And what concernes it? Mel. The sadly thriving progresse of the loves Betweene my Lord the Prince, and that great Lady, Whose insolencie, and never-yet-match'd pride, Can by no Character be well exprest, But in her onlie name, the prow'd Erota. Gas. Alas Melitus, I should ghesse, the best Successe your Prince could find from her, to be As harsh as the event doth prove: but now 'Tis not a time to pity passionate griefes, When a whole Kingdome in a manner lies Upon its death-bed bleeding. Mel. Who can tell Whether or no, these many plagues at once Hang over this unhappie Land, for her sake, That is a monster in it. Gas. Here's the miserie Of having a child our Prince: else I presume The bold Venecians had not dar'd to attempt So bloudie an Invasion. Mel. Yet I wonder Why, Master Secretarie, still the Senate So almost superstitiouslie adores, Gonzalo the Venetian Lord, considering The outrage of his Countrymenâ Gas. The Senate Is wise, and therein just, for this Gonzalo, Upon a Massacre performed at Sea By the Admirall of Venice, on a Merchant Of Candy, when the cause was to be heard Before the Senate there, in open Court Professed, that the crueltie the Admirall Had shewed, deserved not only fine, but death: For Candy then, and Venice were at peace: Since when upon a motion in the Senate, For conquest of our Land, 'tis known for certaine, That only this Gonzalo dar'd to oppose it, His reason was, because it too much favoured Of Lawlesse, and unjust ambition. The wars were scarce begun, but he (in feare Of quarrels 'gainst his life) fled from his Countrie, And hether came, where (to confirme his truth) I know (Melitus) he, out of his owne store, Hath monied Cassilanes the Generall. Mel. What, without other pledges then Cassilanes Bare promise of payment? Gas. No, it may be He has some pettie Lordship to retire to: But this he hath done; now 'tis fit Melitus, The Senate should be thankefull, otherwise, They should annihilate one of those Laws, For which this Kiagdome is throughout the world Unfollowed, and admired. Mel. What Lawes are these? sir, Let me so much importune you. Gas. You shall, And they be worth your knowledge; briefly thus: Who ere he be that can detect apparantly Another of ingratitude, for any Received benefit, the Plaintiffe may Require the offenders life; unlesse he please Freely, and willingly to grant remission. Mel. By which strict Law the Senate is in danger, Should they neglect Gonzalo. Gas. Right; the Law Permits a like equalitie to Aliens, As to a home-borne Patriot. Mel. Pray sir the other? Gas. Know Melitus, The elder Cretans flourished many yeares, In War, in Peace, unparalel'd, and they (To spurre heroicke spirits on to vertue) Enacted that what man so ere he were, Did noblest in the field against his enemie, So by the generall voice approv'd, and knowne, Might at his home-returne, make his demand For satisfaction, and reward. Mel. They are Both famous Lawes indeed. Enter a Messenger. Mes. Master Secretarie, The Senate is about to sit, and crave Your presence. Gas. What, so suddenly? Mes. These Letters Will shew the causes why. Gas. Heaven thou art great, And worthie to be thanked. Mel. Your countenance sir Doth promise some good tidings. Gas. O the best And happiest for this land, that e're was told! All the Venetian Forces are defeated. Mel. How Sir? Gas. And what doth adde some delight more, There is amongst the Souldiers a contention Who shall be the triumpher and it stands Doubtfull betweene a Father and his Son, Old Cassilanes, and young Antinous. Mel. Why may not both demand it? Gas. The Law denies it: But where the Souldiers do not all consent, The parties in contention, are refer'd To plead before the Senate; and from them, Upon an open Audience, to be judg'd The Chiefe, and then to make demands. Mel. You ravish me With wonder and delight. Gas. Come: as we walke, I shall more fully informe you. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 2. Enter Cassilanes, Arcanes, Antinous, and Decius. Cas. Admit no Souldier neare us, till the Senate Have tooke their places. Arc. You are obey'd, my Lord. Ant. Decius, fall off. Dec. I shall. Cas. Give leave Arcanes: Young-man come nearer to me: who am I? Ant. It were a sin against the piety Of filiall duty, if I should forget The debt I owe my father on my knee; Your pleasure? Cas. What, so low? canst thou finde joynts, Yet be an Elephant? Antinous, rise: Thou wilt belye opinion, and rebate The ambition of thy gallantry, that they Whose confidence thou hast bewitched, should see Their little God of War, kneele to his father, Though in my hand I did graspe Thunder. Ant. Sir, For proofe that I acknowledge you the Author Of giving me my birth, I have discharg'd A part of my obedience. But if now You should (as cruell fathers do) proclame Your right, and Tyrant like usurp the glory Of my peculiar honours, not deriv'd From successary, but purchas'd with my bloud, Then I must stand first Champion for my selfe, Against all interposers. Cas. Boldly urg'd, And proudly, I could love thee, did not anger Consult with just disdaine, in open language To call thee most ungratefull. Say freely, Wilt thou resigne the flatteries, whereon The reeling pillars of a popular breath, Have rais'd thy Giant-like conceit; to adde A suffrage to thy fathers merit, speake? Ant. Sir, heare me: were there not a Chronicle Well pend by all their tongues, who can report What they have seene you do; or had you not Best in your owne performance writ your selfe, And been your own Text, I would undertake Alone, without the helpe of Art, or Character, But only to recount you deeds in Armes, And you should ever then be fam'd a president Of living victory: But as you are Great, and well worthy to be stiled great, It would betray a povertie of spirit In me to obstruct my fortunes, or discent, If I should coward-like surrender up The interest, which the inheritance of your vertue, And mine owne thriftie fate can claime in honour: My Lord, of all the masse of fame, which any That weares a sword, and hath but seen me fight, Gives me, I will not share, nor yeild one jot, One tittle. Cas. Not to me? Ant. You are my father, Yet not to you. Cas. Ambitious boy, how darst thou To tell me, that thou wilt contend? Ant. Had I Been sloathfull, and not followed you in all The streights of death, you might have justly then Reputed me a bastard; 'tis a cruelty, More then to murther Innocents, to take The life of my yet Infant-honour from me. Cas. Antinous, looke upon this badge of age, Thy fathers gray-hair'd beard: full fifty yeares, (And more then halfe of this, ere thou wert borne) I have been knowne a Souldier, in which time I found no difference 'twixt War and Peace, For War was peace to me, and Peace was war; Antinous, marke me well; there hath not liv'd These fifty yeares, a man whom Creet prefer'd Before thy farher; let me boldly boast, Thy father, both for Discipline, and Action, Hath so long been the first of all his Nation; Now canst thou thinke it honest, charitable, Nay humane, being so young, my son, my child, Begot, bred, taught by me, by me thy father, For one dayes service, and that on thy first, To rob me of a glory which I fought for A halfe of hundred yeares. Ant. My case observes Both equity, and presidents; for sir, That very day whereon you got your fame, You tooke it from some other, who was then Chiefe in repute, as you are now; and had been Perhaps as many yeares deserving that, Which you gain'd in a day, as I have mine. Cas. But he was not my father then Antinous. Thou leav'st out that. Ant. Sir had he been your father, He had been then immortall: for a father Heightens his reputation, where his son Inherits it, as when you give us life, Your life is not diminish'd, but renew'd In us, when you are dead, and we are still Your living Images. Cas. So be thou curs'd In thy posterity, as I in thee, Dishonorable boy: O shall that Sun, Which not a yeare yet since, beheld me mounted Upon a fierie steed, waving my sword, And teaching this young-man to manage Armes, That was a raw, fresh novice in the feates Of Chivalrie, shall that same sun be witnesse Against this brat, of his ingratitude? Who to ecclipse the light of my renowne, Can no way hope to get a Noble name, But by the treading on his fathers greatnesse; Thou wilt not yeald? Enter Arcanes. Ant. My life, but not the prize My Sword hath purchas'd. Arc. The Senate My Lord are here at hand; and all the souldiers Begin to throng about them. Cas. Now Arcanes theâ Arc. What sir? Cas. Trifles will affront us: that Fine fighting Stripling, Arc. Let him have the shame on't: Please you withdraw on this side. Cas. My great heart Was never quaild before. Dec. My Lord be confident, Let not your father dant you. Ant. Decius, whether Must I withdraw? Dec. On this side.âSee the Souldiers Attend your pleasureâcourage sir; the Senate. Cas. Way for the Senate. Enter Porphicio, Possenme (3 Senators) Gonzalo, Gaspero, Souldiers. My good Lords I know not What taxe of arrogance I may incurre, Should I presume, though courted by your favours. To take a place amongst you: I had rather Give proofe of my unfeign'd humility By force, though meane, yet more becomming place, Then run the hazard of a doubtfull censure. Pos. My Lord, your wisedome is both known &amp; try'd; We cannot ranke ye in a nobler friendship, Then your great service to the state deserves. Por. Wil't please you sit? Enter Fernando with Sold. Gonz. What here my Lord Porphicio? It must not be. Porp. My Lord you are too modest. Gonz. It is no season to be troublesome, ElseâBut I have done: Your Lordships are observ'd. Gosp. Is the demandant ready? Arc. He is ready. Gasp. Produce him then. Arc. Before this sacred presence, I, by a generall consent, am made The Souldiers voice, and to your gratious wisedomes, Present as chiefe in Armes, his Countries Champion, Cassilanes. Dec. Most reverend Lords, you heare the lesser number Of those who have been Guardians to this Countrey, Approve this Champion; I in all their names Who fought for Candy, here present before you The mightiest man in Armes, Antinous. Speak fellow souldiers. Sold. Antinous, Antinous. Gasp. Stand by all, save the two competitors. Poss. My Lords, how much your Countrey owes you both, The due reward of your desertfull glories Must to posterity remain: But yet Since, by our Law, one onely can make claime To the proposed honours which you both (It seems) have truely merited, take leave Freely to plead your rights: we shall attend you. Porp. Wherein priority of voyce is granted Lord Cassilanes to you: for that your rare And long experience in the course of war, As well doth challenge it, as the best priviledge Of Order and civility, for that You are your brave opponents worthy father. Say Countrey-men, are you content? Sold. I, I. Cass. Right grave, right gratious fathers; how unfit It is for me, that all my life time have Been practis'd in the schoole of bloud, and slaughter. To bandy words now in my lifes last farewell, Your wisedomes will consider; were there pitcht Another, and another field, like that Which not yet three days since, this arme hath scatter'd, Defeated, and made nothing, then the man That had a heart to thinke he could but follow, (For equall me he should not) through the lanes Of danger and amazement, might in that, That onely of but folowing me, be happy, Reputed worthy to be made my rivall: For 'tis not Lords, unknowne to those about me, (My fellow souldiers) first with what a confidence I led them on to fight, went on still, and And as if I could have beene a second Nature, As well in heartning them by my example, As by my exhortation, I gave life To quicken courage, to inflame revenge, To heighten resolution; in a word, To out-doe action: It boots not to discover, How that yong-man, who was not fledg'd nor skil'd In Martiall play, was even as ignorant As childish: But I list not to disparage His non-ability: The signall given Of Battaile, when our enemies came on, (Directed more by fuerie, then warrant Of Policy and Stratagem) I met them, I in the fore-front of the Armies met them; And as if this old weather-beaten body Had been compos'd of Cannon-proof, I stood The volleys of their shot. I, I my selfe Was he that first dis-rankt their woods of Pikes: But when we came to handy-stroaks, as often As I lent blowes, so often I gave wounds, And every wound a death. I may be bold To justifie a truth, this very sword Of mine slew more then any twaine besides: And, which is not the least of all my glorie, When he, this young man, hand to hand in fight, Was by the Generall of the Venetians, And such as were his retinue, unhors'd, I stept between, and rescu'd him my selfe, Or horses hoofs had trampled him to dirt; And whilst he was re-mounting, I maintain'd The combate with the gallant Generall, Till having taken breath, he throng'd hefore me, Renew'd the fight, and with a fatall blow, Stole both that honour from me, and his life From him, whom I before my selfe alone, Had more then full three quarters kill'd: A man Well worthy onely by this hand to have dy'd, Not by a Boyes weak push: I talke too much, But 'tis a fault of Age: If to bring home Long peace, long victorie, even to your Capitoll; If to secure your Kingdome, Wives, and Children, Your lives and liberties; if to renowne Your honours through the world, to fix your names, Like Blazing starres, admir'd, and fear'd by all, That have but heard of Candy, or a Cretane, Be to deserve the approvement of my man-hood, Then thus much have I done: what more, examine The Annalls of my life; and then consider What I have been, and am. Lords I have said. Gonz. With reverence to the Senate, is it lawfull, Without your Customes breach, to say a word? Pos. Say on my Lord Gonzalo. Gonz. I have heard, And with no little wonder, such high deeds Of Chivalrie discours'd, that I confesse, I doe not think the Worthies while they liv'd All nine, deserv'd as much applause, or memorie, As this one: But who can doe ought to gaine The Crowne of honour from him, must be some what More then a man; you tread a dangerous path, Yet I shall heare you gladly: for believe me, Thus much let me professe, in honours cause, I would not to my father, nor my King, (My Countries father) yield: if you transcend What we have heard, I can but onely say, That miracles are yet in use. I feare I have offended. Porp. You have spoken nobly. Antinous use your priviledge. Ant. Princely fathers, E're I begin, one suit I have to make, 'Tis just, and honourable. Porp., Poss. Speak, and have it. Ant. That you would please the souldiers might all stand Together by their Generall. Poss. 'Tis granted. All fall to yonder side: Goe on, Antinous. Ant. I shall be briefe and plaine: All what my father (This Countries Patron) hath discours'd, is true. Fellowes in Armes: speak you is't true? Sol. True, true. Ant. It followes, that the blaze of my performance Took light from what I saw him doe; and thus A City (though the flame be much more dreadfull) May from a little sparke be set on fire; Of all what I have done, I shall give instance Onely in three maine proofs of my desert. First I sought out (but through how many dangers My Lords judge ye) the chiefe, the great Commander, The head of that huge body, whose prowd weight Our Land shrunke under, him I found and fought with, Fought with, and slew. Fellowes in Armes, speak you, Is't true or not? Sold. True, true. Ant. When he was falne, The hearts of all our adversaries? Began to quaile, till young Fernando, sonne To the last Duke of Venice gather'd head, And soone renew'd the field, by whose example The bold Venetians doubling strength and courage Had got the better of the day, our men Supposing that their adversaries grew Like Hydra's head, recoyle, and 'gan to flye: I follow'd them; and what I said, they know; The summe on't is; I call'd them back, new rankt them; Lead on, they follow'd, shrunk not till the end: Fellowes in Armes is't true, or no. Sold. True, true. Ant. Lastly, to finish all, there was but one, The onely great exploit; which was to take Fernando prisoner, and that hand to hand In single fight I did: my selfe without The helpe of any arme, save the arme of heaven. Speak souldiers, is it true, or no? Sol. Antinous, Antinous. Ant. Behold my prisoner, Fathers. Fern. This one man Ruin'd our Army, and hath glorifi'd Creete in her robes of mightinesse and conquest. Pos. We need not use long circumstance of words, Antinous thou art conquerer: the Senate, The souldiers, and thy valour have pronounc'd it. All. Antinous, Antinous. Porp. Make thy demand. Cas. Please ye (my Lord) give leave That I may part. Pos. No Cassilanes, the Court Should therein be dishonour'd, doe not imagine We prize your presence at so slight a rate. Demand Antinous. Ant. Thus (my Lords) to witnesse How far I am from arrogance, or thinking I am more valiant, though more favour'd Then my most matchlesse father, my demand is, That for a lasting memorie of his name, His deeds, his reall, nay his royall worth, You set up in your Capitoll in Brasse My fathers Statue, there to stand for ever A Monument and Trophy of his victories, With this Inscription to succeeding ages, Great Cassilanes, Patron of Candy's Peace, Perpetuall Triumpher. Por., Pos. It is granted. What more? Ant. No more. Cas. How boy? Gonz. Thou art immortall, Both for thy Son-like pietie, and beauties Of an unconquer'd minde. Ant. My Prisoner (Lords) To your more sacred wisedomes I surrender: Fit you his ransome; halfe whereof I give For largesse to the Souldiers: the other halfe To the erection of this monument. Cass. Ambitious villaine. Gonz. Thou art all un-immitable. My Lords to work a certaine peace for Candy With Venice, use Fernando like a Prince; His ransome Ile disburse what e're it be: Yet you may stay him with you, till conditions Of amitie shall be concluded on: Are yee content? Porp. We are, and ever rest Both friends add debters to your noblenesse. Gonz. Souldiers attend me in the Market-place, Ile thither send your largesse. Sold. Antinous, Antinous. Exeunt. Cas. I have a sute too, Lords. Porp., Pos. Propose it, 'tis yours, if fit and just. Cas. Let not my services, My being forty yeares a drudge, a pack-horse To you, and to the State, be branded now With Ignominy ne're to be forgotten: Reare me no Monument, unlesse you meane To have me fam'd a Coward, and be stamp'd so. Pos. We understand you not. Cas. Proud boy, thou dost, And Tyrant-like insult'st upon my shame. Ant. Sir, heaven can tell, and my integrity, What I did, was but onely to inforce The Senates gratitude. I now acknowledge it. Cas. Observe it Fathers, how this haughty boy Growes cunning in his envy of mine honours: He knowes no mention can of me be made, But that it ever likewise must be told, How I by him was master'd; and for surety That all succeeding times may so report it, He would have my dishonour, and his Triumphs Ingrav'd in Brasse: hence, hence proceeds the falshood Of his insinuating piety. Thou art no childe of mine: thee and thy bloud, Here in the Capitoll, before the Senate, I utterly renounce: So thrift and fate Confirme me; henceforth never see my face, Be, as thou art, a villaine to thy father. Lords I must crave your leaves: come, come Arcanes. Ex. Gonz. Here's a strange high-borne spirit. Pos. 'Tis but heat Of suddaine present rage; I dare assure Antinous of his favour. Ant. I not doubt it, He is both a good man, and a good father. I shall attend your Lordships. Poss. Doe Antinous. Gonz. Yes: feast thy Triumphs, With applause and pleasures. Por., Poss. Lead on. Exeunt. Flor. Cornets. Ant. I utterly renounceâ'Twas so? Was't not, my Decius? Dec. Pish, you know my Lord, Old men are chollerick. Ant. And lastly parted With, never henceforth see my face: O me, How have I lost a Father? Such a father? Such a one Decius! I am miserable, Beyond expression. Dec. Fie, how unbecomming This shewes upon your day of fame? Ant. O mischiefe: I must no more come neare him; that I know, And am assur'd on't. Dec. Say you doe not? Ant. True Put case I doe not: what is Candy then To lost Antinous? Malta, I resolve To end my dayes in thee. Dec. How's that? Ant. Ile trie All humble meanes of being reconcil'd, Which if deny'd, then I may justly say, This day has prov'd my worst: Decius my worst. Exeunt</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Gonzalo, and Gaspero. Gasp. Now to what you have heard; as no man can Better then I, give you her Character; For I have been both nurs'd, and traind up to Her petulant humours, and been glad to beare them, Her brother, my late Master, did no lesse: Strong apprehensions of her beauty hath Made her believe that she is more then woman: And as there did not want those flatterers 'Bout the worlds Conquerour, to make him think, And did perswade him that he was a god; So there be those base flies, that will not stick To buzze into her eares she is an Angel, And that the food she feeds on is Ambrosia. Gonz. She should not touch it then, 'tis Poets fare. Gas. I may take leave to say, she may as well Determine of her selfe to be a goddesse, With lesser flatterie then he a god: For she does conquer more, although not farther. Every one looks on her dyes in despaire, And would be glad to doe it actually, To have the next age tell how worthily, And what good cause he had to perish so: Her beauty is superlative, she knowes it, And knowing it, thinks no man can deserve, But ought to perish, and to dye for her: Many great Princes for her love have languish'd, And given themselves a willing sacrifice, Proud to have ended so: And now there is A Prince so manded in his owne passions, That he forgets the Royaltie he was borne to, And deems it happinesse to be her slave. Gonz. You talke as if you meant to winde me in, And make me of the number. Gas. Sir, mistake me not, the service that I owe ye Shall plead for me: I tell you what she is, What she expects, and what she will effect, Unlesse you be the miracle of men, That come with a purpose to behold, And goe away your selfe. Gon. I thanke you, I will doe it: But pray resolve me, How is she stor'd with wit? Gas. As with beauty, Infinite, and more to be admired at, Then medled with. Gonz. And walks her tongue the same gate with her feet? Gas. Much beyond: what ere her heart thinks, she utters: And so bold, so readily, as you would judge It penn'd and studied. Gonz. She comes. Enter Erota, Philander, Annophill, Hyparcha, Mochingo, Attendants. Gas. I must leave you then, But my best wishes shall remain with you. Gonz. Still I must thanke you. This is the most passionate, Most pitifull Prince, Who in the Caldron of affections, Looks as he had been par-boyl'd. Phil. If I offend with too much loving you, It is a fault that I must still commit, To make your mercy shine the more on me. Erot. You are the selfe-same creature you condemne, Or else you durst not follow me with hope That I can pittie you, who am so farre From granting any comfort in this kinde, That you and all men else shall perish first: I will live free and single, till I finde Something above a man to equall me; Put all your brave Heroes into one, Your Kings and Emperours, and let him come In person of a man, and I should scorne him: Must, and will scorne him. The god of Love himselfe hath lost his eyes, His Bow and Torch extinguish'd, and the Poets That made him first a god, have lost their fire Since I appear'd, and from my eyes must steale it. This I dare speak; and let me see the man, Now I have spoke it, that doth, dare deny; Nay, not believe it. Mo. He is mad that does not. Erot. Have not all the nations of the earth heard of me? Most come to see me, and seeing me, return'd Full of my praises? teaching there Chroniclers To make their Stories perfect? for where the name, Meerely the word of faire Erota stands, It is a lasting History to time, Begetting admiration in the men, And in my owne Sex envie; which glorie's lost, When I shall stick my beautie in a cloud, And clearely shine through it. Gonz. This Woman's in the altitudes, and he must be A good Astrologer shall know her Zodiack. Phil. For any man to thinke Himselfe an able purchaser of you, But in the bargaine there must be declar'd Infinite bounty: otherwise I vow, By all that's excellent and gracious in you, I would untenant every hope lodg'd in me, And yield my selfe up Loves, or your owne Martyr. Erot. So you shall please us. Phil. O you cannot be So heavenly, and so absolute in all things, And yet retaine such cruell tyranny. Erot. I can, I doe, I will. Gonz. She is in her Moods, and her Tences: Ile Gramer with you, And make a triall how I can decline you: By your leave (great Lady.) Erot. What are you? Gonz. A man, a good man, that's a wealthy; A Proper man, and a proud man too; one That understands himselfe, and knowes, unlesse It be your self, no woman on the Universe deserves him. Nay, Lady, I must tell you too withall. I may make doubt of that, unlesse you paint With better judgement next day then on this; For (plaine I must be with you) 'tis a dull Fucus. Erot. Knowes any one here what this fellow is? Attend. He is of Venice (Madam) a great Magnifico, And gracious with the Senate. Erot. Let him keep then among them; what makes he here? Heres state enough where I am: here's a doeâ You, tell him, if he have ought with us, let him Look lower, and give it in Petition. Mo. Mighty Magnifico, my Mistris bid me tell you, If you have ought with her, you must look lower, And yeeld it in Petition. Gonz. Here is for thee a Ducket. Mon. You say well sir, take your owne course. Gonz. I will not grace you (Lady) so much as take you by the hand; But when I shall vouchsafe to touch your lip, It shall be through your Court a holy-day Proclamed for so high favour. Erot. This is some Great mans Jester: Sirrah, begone, here is No place to foole in. Gonz. Where are the fooles you talke of? I doe keep two. Erot. No question of it: for In your selfe you doe maintaine an hundred. Gonz. And besides them I keep a noble traine, Statists, and men of action: my purse is large and deep, Beyond the reach of riot to draw drie: Fortune did vie with Nature, to bestow (When I was borne) her bountie equally: 'Tis not amisse you turne your eyes from me; For should you stand and gaze me in the face, You perish would, like Semele by Iolus: In Venice at this instant there do lye No lesse then threescore Ladies in their graves, And in their Beds five hundred for my love. Mo. You lie more then they; yet it becomes him bravely; Would I could walke and talke so? Ile endeavour it. Erot. Sir, doe you know me? Gon. Yes, you were sister to the late Prince of Candy, Aunt to this young one: And I in Venice, I am borne a Lord; equall to you in fortunes, In shape; Ile say no more, but view. Mon. There needs no more be said, were I a womanâ O he does rarely: in shape; Ile say no more, But view: Who could say more, who better? Man is no man, nor woman woman is, Unlesse they have a pride like one of these. How poore the Prince of Cyprus shewes to him? How poore another Lady unto her: Carriage and State makes us seem demi-gods, Humility, like beasts, wormes of the earth. Enter Antinous and Decius. Ant. Royall Lady, I kisse your hand. Erot. Sir, I know you not. Anno. O my noble Brother, welcome from the wars. Ant. Deare sister. Ann. Where is my father, that you come without him? We have news of your successe: he has his health I hope? Ant. Yes sister, he has his health, but is not well. Ann. How not well? what Riddles do you utter? Ant. Ile tell you more in private. Gonz. Noble sir, I cannot be unmindfull of your merit, Since I last heard it: you are a hopefull youth, And (indeed) the soule of Candy. I must speak my thoughts. Ann. The Prince of Cyprus Brother, Good Decius. Ant. I am his servant. Phil. You are the Patron of your Countrie, sir, So your unimitable deeds proclame you, It is no language of my owne, but all mens. Gonz. Your Enemies must needs acknowledge it: Then doe not thinke it flatterie in your friends, For if they had a heart, they could not want a tongue. Erot. Is this your brother Annophill? Anno. Yes Madam. Frot. Your name's Antinous? Ant. I am (Lady) that most unfortunate man. Erot. How unfortunate? are you not the souldier, The Captaine of those Captaines, that did bring Conquest and victory home along with you? Ant. I had some share in't; but was the least Of the least worthy. Gonz. O sir, in your modesty youl'd make A double Conquest: I was an eare-witnesse When this young man spoke lesser then he acted, And had the souldiers voice to helpe him out: But that the Law compell'd him for his honour, To inforce him make a claime for his reward, I well perceive he would have stood the man That he does now, buried his worth in silence. Erot. Sir, I hearken not to him, but looke on you, And finde more in you then he can relate? You shall attend on me. Ant. Madam, your pardon. Ero. Deny it not sir, for it is more honour Then you have goten ith' field: for know you shall, Upon Erota's asking, serve Erota. Ant. I may want answers, Lady, But never want a will to doe you service. I came here to my sister, to take leave, Having enjoyn'd my selfe to banishment, For some cause that hereafter you may heare, And wish with me I had not the occasion. Anno. There shall be no occasion to divide us: Deare Madam for my sake use your power, Even for the service that he ought to owe, Must, and does owe to you his friends, and countrey. Erot. Upon your Loyalty to the state and me, I doe command you Sir, not depart Candy: Am I not your Princesse? Ant. You are a great Lady. Erot. Then shew your selfe a Servant and a Subject. Ant. I am your vassaile. Mon. You are a Coward; I that dare not fight, Scorne to be vassaile to any Prince in Europe: Great is my heart with pride, which Ile encrease When they are gone, with practise on my Vassailes. Atten. The noble Cassilane is come to see you Madam, Dec. There's comfort in those words, Antinous: For heres the place, and persons, that have power, To reconcile you to his love againe. Ant. That were a fortunate meeting. Enter Cassilane and Arcanes. Cas. Greatnesse still wait you Lady. Ero. Good Cassilane, we doe maintain our greatnesse, Through your valour. Cas. My prayers pull dayly blessings on thy head, My un-offending childe, my Annophill, Good Prince, worthy Gonzalo! ha? art thou here Before me? in every action art thou ambitious? My duty (Lady) first offered here, And love to thee (my childe) though he out-strip me; Thus in the wars he got the start on me, By being forward, but performing lesse; All the endeavours of my life are lost, And throwne upon that evill of mine owne Cursed begetting, whom I shame to father. O that the heat thou robd'st me off, had burnt Within my Entrailes, and begot a feaver, Or some worse sicknesse, for thou art a disease Sharper then any physick gives a name to. Ann. Why doe you say so? Cas. O Annophill; there is good cause my girle: He has plaid the thiefe with me, and filch'd away The richest jewell of my life, my honour, Wearing it publikely with that applause, As if he justly did inherit it. Ant. Would I had in my Infancy been laid Within my grave, covered with you blessings, Then growne up to a man, to meet your curses. Cas. O that thou hadst. Then I had been the father of a childe, Dearer then thou wert even unto me, When hope perswaded me I had begot Another selfe in thee: Out of mine eyes, As farre as I have throwne thee from my heart, That I may live and dye forgetting thee. Ero. How has he deserv'd this untam'd anger, That when he might have ask't for his reward Some honour for himselfe, or masse of pelfe, He onely did request to have erected Your Statue in the Capitoll, with Titles Ingrav'd upon't, The Patron of his Countrey? Cas. That, that's the poison in the gilded cup, The Serpent in the flowers, that stings my honour, And leaves me dead in fame: Gods doe a justice, And rip his bosome up, that men may see, Seeing, believe the subtle practises Written within his heart: But I am heated, And doe forget this presence, and my selfe. Your pardon, Lady. Ero. You should not aske, 'lesse you knew how to give. For my sake Cassilane, cast out of your thoughts All ill conceptions of your worthy son, That (questionlesse) has ignorantly offended, Declared in his penitence. Cas. Bid me dye (Lady) for your sake Ile doe it; But that you'll say is nothing, for a man That has out-liv'd his honour: But command me In any thing save that, and Cassilane Shall ever be your servant. Come Annophill, (My joy in this world) thou shalt live with me, Retired in some sollitarie nook,) The comfort of my age; my dayes are short, And ought to be well spent: and I desire No other witnesse of them but thy selfe, And good Arcanes. Anno. I shall obey you sir. Gonz. Noble sir: If you taste any want of worldly meanes, Let not that discontent you: know me your friend, That hath, and can supply you. Cas. Sir, I am too much bound to you already, And 'tis not of my cares the least, to give you Faire satisfaction. Gonz. You may imagine I doe speak to that end, But trust me, 'tis to make you bolder with me. Cas. Sir, I thanke you, and may make triall of you, Meane time my service. Ann. Brother be comforted; so long as I continue Within my fathers love, you cannot long Stand out an Exile: I must goe live with him, And I will prove so good an Orator In your behalfe, that you againe shall gaine him, Or I will stirre in him another anger, And be lost with you. Ant. Better I were neglected: for he is hasty, And through the Choller that abounds in him, (Which for the time divides from him his judgement) He may cast you off, and with you his life; For griefe will strait surprize him, and that way Must be his death: the sword has try'd too often, And all the deadly Instruments of warre Have aim'd at his great heart, but ne're could touch it: Yet not a limbe about him wants a scarre. Cas. Madam my dutyâ Ero. Will you he gone? Cas. I must (Lady) but I shall be ready, When you are pleas'd command me, for your service. Excellent PrinceâTo all my heartie love, And a good farewell. Mon. Thanks honest Cassilane. Cas. Come Annophill. Gonz. Shall I not wait upon you sir? Cas. From hence you shall not stirre a foot: Loving Gonzalo, it must be all my study To requite you. Gonz. I may be so fortunate to deserve The name of friend from you, I have enough. Cvs. You are so, and you have made your selfe so. Gonz. I will then preserve it. Ero. Antinous you are my servant, are you not? Ant. It hath pleased you so to grace me. Ero. Why are you then dejected? you will say, You have lost a father; but you have found a Mistris Doubles that losse: be master of your spirit; You have a cause for it: which is my favour, Gonz. And mine. Ero. Will no man ease me of this foole? Gonz. Your fellow. Ero. Antinous wait upon us. Ant. I shall Madam. Gonz. Nay but Ladie, Ladie. Erot. Sir, you are rude: and if you be the Master Of such meanes as you doe talk of, you should Learne good manners. Gonz. O Lady, you can finde a fault in me, But not perceive it in your selfe; you must, shall heare me: I love you for your pride, 'tis the best vertue In you. Erot. I could hang this fellow now: by whom Are you supported, that you dare doe this? Have you not example here in a Prince Transcending you in all things, yet beares himselfe As doth become a man had seen my beautie? Back to your Countrey, and your Curtizans, Where you may be admired for your wealth, Which being consum'd, may be a meanes to gaine you The opinion of some wit. Here's nothing To be got but scorne, and losse of time. Gonz. Which are things I delight in. Erot. Antinous follow me. Exit. Gonz. She is vext to the soule. Mon. Let her be vext, 'tis fit she should be so: Give me thy hand Gonzalo, thou art in our favour, For we doe love to cherish lofty spirits, Such as percusseere the earth, and bound With an erected countenance to the clouds. Gonz. 'S-foot, what thing is this? Mon. I doe love fire-works, because they mount: An Exhalation I professe to adore, Beyond a fixed starre, 'tis more illustrious, As every thing rais'd out of smoak is so: Their vertue is in action: what doe you think of me? Gonz. Troth sir, You are beyond my ghesse, I know you not. Mo. Doe you know your selfe? Gonz. Yes sir. Mon. Why you and I are one: I am proud, and Very proud too, that I must tell you; I saw It did become you, cousin Gonzalo, prethee Let it be so. Gonz. Let it be so good cousin. Mon. I am no great ones foole. Gonz. I hope so, for alliance sake. Mo. Yet I do serve the Mighty, Monstrous, and Magnanimous Invincible Erota. Gonz. O good cousin, now I have you: Ile meet you in your Coat. Mo. Coat? I have my horse-mans coat I must confesse Lin'd through with Velvet, and a Scarlet out-side; If you'll meet me in't, Ile send fort; And cousin you shall see me with much comfort, For it is both a new one, and a right one, It did not come collaterall. Gon. Adieu good cousin; at this present I have some businesse. Mo. Farewell (excellent cousin.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Gonzalo and Fernando. Gonz. Candy, I say, is lost already. Fer. Yes, If to be conquer or be to be lost. Gonz. You have it; one dayes conquest hath undone them, And sold them to their vassalage; for what Have I else toyl'd my braines, profusely emptied My moneyes, but to make them slaves to Venice, That so in case the sword did lose his edge, Then Art might sharpen hers? Fer. Gonzalo how? Gonz. Fernando thus: you see how through this Land, Both of the best and basest I am honour'd; I onely gave the State of Venice notice, When, where, and how to land, or you had found A better entertainment: I was he Encourag'd young Antinous to affront The devill his father: for the devill I think Dares not doe more in battaile. Fer. But why did ye? I finde no such great policie in that. Gonz. Indeed Fernando, thou canst fight, not plot: Had they continu'd one, they two alone Were of sufficient courage and performance To beat an Armie. Fern. Now by all my hopes, I rather shall admire, then envy vertue. Gonz. Why then by all your hopes you'll rather have Your Braines knockt out, then learne how to be wise; You States-man? Well sir, I did more then this, When Cassilane crav'd from the common treasure Pay for his Souldiers, I strook home, and lent him An hundred thousand Duckets, Fer. Marry sir, The policy was little, the love lesse, And honesty least of all. Gonz. How say ye by that? Go fight, I say goe fight, Ile talke no more with you, You are insensible. Fer. Well, I shall observe ye, Gonz. Why look you sir, by this meanes have I got The greatest part of Cassilanes estate Into my hands, which he can ne're redeem, But must of force sinke: do you conceive me now? Fer. So: But why have you importuned the Senate, For me to sojourne with them? Gonz. There's the quintessence, The soule, and grand elixer of my wit: For he (according to his noble nature) Will not be knowne to want, though he do want, And will be bankrupted so much the sooner, And made the subject of our scorne and laughter. Fern. Here's a perfect plotted stratagem. Gonz. Why? could you Imagine, that I did not hate in heart My Countreyes enemies? yes, yes, Fernando, And I will be the man that shall undoe them. Fer. Ye are in a ready way. Gonz. I was never out on't. Enter Gaspero. Gonz. Peace, Here comes a wise Coxcombe, a tame Coward. Now worthy Gaspero, what, You come (I know) to be my Lord Fernando's Conducter to old Cassilane? Gas. To wait upon him. Gonz. And my Lords the Senators sent you? Gasp. My noble Lord they did. Gonz. My Lord Fernando, This gentleman (as humble as you see him) Is even this Kingdomes treasure; In a word, 'Tis his chiefe glory that he is not wiser Then honest, nor more honest then approv'd In truth and faith. Gasp. My Lord. Gonz. You may be bold To trust him with your bosome, he'll not deceive, If you relie upon him once. Ferd. Your name is Gaspero? Gasp. Your servant. Gonz. Goe commend me (Right honest Gaspero) commend me heartily To noble Cassilane, tell him my love Is vow'd to him. Gas. I shall. Gonz. I know you will. My Lord I cannot long be absent from you. Fer. Sir, you are now my guide. Exit. Gonz. Thus my designes Run uncontroul'd; yet Venice though I be Intelligencer to thee, in my braine Are other large Projects: for if proud Erota Bend to my lure, I will be Candy's King, And Duke of Venice too. Ha? Venice too? O 'twas prettily shov'd in: why not? Erota May in her love seale all sure: if she swallow The bait, I am Lord of both; if not, yet Candy Despight of all her power shall be ruin'd. Enter Cassilane, Arcanes, and Annophill. Cas. Urge me no farther Annophill. Anno. My Lord. Cas. Thy fathers poverty has made thee happie; For though 'tis true, this solitary life Sutes not with youth and beautie, O my childe, Yet 'tis the sweetest Guardian to protect Chaste names from Court-aspersions; there a Lady. Tender and delicate in yeares and graces, That doats upon the charmes of ease and pleasure, Is ship-wrackt on the shore; for 'tis much safer To trust the Ocean in a leaking ship, Then follow greatnesse in the wanton rites Of luxurie and sloth. Ann. My wishes sir, Have never soar'd a higher flight, then truely To finde occasion wherein I might witnesse My duty and obedience. Cas. 'Tis well said, Canst thou forbeare to laugh Arcanes? Arc. Why sir? Cas. To look upon my beggerie, to look upon My patience in my beggerie: Tell me, Does it shew handsome? bravely? Handsome? thou wilt flatter me, And sweare that I am miserable. Arc. Nothing More glorifies the noble, and the valiant, Then to despise contempt: if you continue But to enjoy your selfe, you in your selfe Enjoy all store besides. Cas. An excellent change: I that some seven Apprentice-ships commanded A hundred Ministers, that waited on My nod, and sometimes twenty thousand souldiers, Am now retir'd, attended in my age By one poore maid, followed by one old man. Arc. Sir, you are lower in your owne repute Then you have reason for. Cas. The Romane Captaines, I meane the best, such as with their blouds Purchas'd their Countreyes peace, the Empires glorie, Were glad at last to get them to some Farmes, Off-from the clamours of the ingratefull great ones, And the unsteddy multitude, to live As I doe now, and 'twas their blessing too, Let it be ours Arcanes. Arc. I cannot but Applaud your scorne of injuries. Cas. Of injuries? Arcanes, Annophill, lend both your hands. So, what say yee now? Arc. Why now my Lordâ Cas. I sweare By all my past prosperities; thus standing Between you two, I thinke my selfe as great, As mighty, as if in the Capitoll I stood amidst the Senators, with all The Cretano subjects prostrate at my feet. Ann. Sir, you are here more safe. Cas. And more beloved: Why look yee sirs, I can forget the weaknesse Of the traduced souldiers, the neglect Of the faire-spoken Senate, the impietie Of him, the villaine, whom (to my dishonour) The World miscalls my son. But by theâ Arc. Sir, remember that you promis'd no occasion Should move your patience. Cas. Thou do'st chide me friendly. He shall not have the honour to be thought upon Amongst us. Enter a Servant. Now? the newes? Ser. The Secretarie, With the Venetian prisoner, desire Admittance to your Lordship. Cas. How? to me? What mysterie is this? Arcanes can they Thinkst thou, meane any good? Arc. My Lord, they dare not Intend ought else but good. Cas. Tis true, they dare not; Arcanes welcome them: Come hither Annophill, Stand close to me, wee'll change our affability Into a forme of State: and they shall know Our heart is still our owne. Enter Arcanes, Fernando, and Gaspero. Arc. My Lordâ Cas. Arcanes, I know them both: Fernando, as you are A man of greatnesse, I should under-value The right my sword hath fought for, to observe Low-fawning complements, but as you are A Captive and a stranger, I can love you, And must be kinde. You are welcome. Fern. 'Tis the all Of my ambition. Gas. And for proof how much He truely honours your heroick vertues, The Senate on his importunity, Commend him to your Lordships guard. Cas. For what? Gas. During the time of his abode in Candy. To be your houshold guest. Fer. Wherein my Lord, You shall more make me debtor to your noblenesse, Then if you had return'd me without ransome. Cass. Are you in earnest Sir? Fern. My sute to the Senate Shall best resolve you that. Cass. Come hither Secretarie, Look that this be no trick now put upon me: For if it beâSirrahâ Gas. As I have troth (My Lord) it onely is a favour granted Upon Fernando's motion, from himselfe: Your Lordship must conceive, I'de not partake Ought, but what should concerne your honour; who Has been the prop, our Countries shield, and safety, But the renowned Cassilane? Cass. Applause? Is Gasperoâpuffeânothingâwhy, young Lord, Would you so much be sequester'd from those That are the blazing Comets of the time, To live a solitarie life with me? A man forsaken? all my hospitality Is now contracted to a few; these two, This tempest-wearied souldier, and this Virgin; We cannot feast your eyes with Masques and Revells, Or Courtly Anticks: the sad sports we riot in, Are Tales of foughten fields, of Martiall scarres, And things done long agoe, when men of courage Were held the best, not those well-spoken youths, Who onely carry conquest in their tongues; Now stories of this nature are unseasonable To entertaine a great Dukes son with. Fer. Herein Shall my Captivity be made my happinesse, Since what I lose in freedome, I regaine (With int'rest) by conversing with a Souldier So matchlesse for experience, as great Cassilane. Pray sir admit me. Cas. If you come to mock me, I shall be angrie. Fer. By the love I beare To goodnesse, my intents are honourable. Cas. Then in a word, my Lord, your visitations Shall find all due respect: But I am now Growne old, and have forgot to be an host; Come when you please you are welcome. Fer. Sir, I thank you. Ann. Good sir be not too urgent; for my father Will soon be mov'd: yet in a noble way Of courtesie he is as easily conquer'd. Fer. Lady, your words are like your beauty, powerfull; I shall not strive more how to doe him service, Then how to be your servant. Cas. Shee's my daughter, And does command this house. Fer. I so conceive her. Cas. Doe you heare? Gas. My honour'd Lord. Cas. Commend me to them. Tell 'em I thank them. Gas. Whom my Lord? Cas. The Senate: Why how come you so dull? O they are gratious, And infinitely gratefullâThou art eloquent, Speak modestly in mentioning my services: And if ought fall out in the By, that must Of meere necessity touch any act Of my deserving praises, blush when you talke on't, 'Twill make them blush to heare on't. Gas. Why my Lordâ Cas. Nay, nay, you are too wise now; good, observe me, I doe not raile against the hopefull Springall, That builds up monuments in Brasse; reares Trophies With Mottoes and Inscriptions, quaint devices Of Poetrie and fiction; let's be quiet. Arc. You must not crosse him. Gas. Not for Candys wealth. Fer. You shall for ever make me yours. Ann. 'Twere pitty to double your captivity. Arc. Who's here, Decius? Enter Decius. Cas. Ha! Decius? who nam'd Decius? Dec. My duty to your Lordship: I am bold, Presuming on your noble and knowne goodnesse Toâ Cas. What? Dec. Present you with thisâ Cas. Letter? Dec. Yes my honour'd Lord. Cas. From whom? Dec. Please you peruse The in-side, you shall finde a name subscrib'd, In such humility, in such obedience, That you your selfe will judge it tyranny Not to receive it favourably. Cas. Hey-day. Good words my Masters; this is Court-infection, And none but Cowards ply them: Tell me, Decius, Without more circumstance, who is the sender? Dec. Your much griev'd sonne Antinous. Cas. On my life A challenge; speak, as thou art worthy speak: Ile answer't. Dec. Honour'd Sir. Cas. No honour'd Sirsâ Foole your yong Idoll with such pompous Attributes. Say briefely, what containes it? Dec, 'Tis a lowly Petition for your favour. Cas. Rash young man, But that thou art under my owne roofe, and know'st I dare not any way infringe the Lawes Of hospitality, thou should'st repent Thy bold and rude intrusion. But presume not Againe to shew thy Letter, for thy life; Decius, not for thy life. Arc. Nay then (my Lord) I can with-hold no longer: you are too rough, And wrestle against nature, with a violence More then becomes a father: wherein would yee Come nearer to the likenesse of God, Then in your being entreated? Let not thirst Of honour, make you quite forget you are A man, and what makes perfect man-hoods, comforts A father. Ann. If a memory remaine Of my departed mother; if the purity Of her unblemish'd faith deserve to live In your remembrance, let me yet by these Awake your love to my uncomforted Brother. Fer. I am a stranger: but so much I tender Your sons desertfull vertues, that I vow His Sword nere conquer'd me so absolutely, As shall your curtesie, if you vouchsafe At all our instances, to new receive him, Into your wonted favour. Gas. Sir, you cannot Require more low submission. Anno. Am I not Growne vile yet in your eyes? then by the name Of father, let me once more sue for him, Who is the only now remaining-branch With me, of that most ancient roote, whose body You are, deare sir. Cas. 'Tis well: an host of furies Could not have baited me, more torturingly, More rudely, or more most unnaturally? Decius, I say, let me no more heare from him; For this time goe thou hence, and know from me Thou art beholding to me that I have not Killed thee already, looke to't next, looke to't. Arcanes fie, fie Annophil, Exit. Arc. He's gone. Chaf'd beyond sufferance: we must follow him. Dec. Lady, this letter is to you. Anno. Come with me, For we must speake in private: please you sir, To see what entertainement our sad house Can yeild? Ex. Fer. I shall attend you Lady. Gas. How do ye like To sojourne here, my Lord? Fer. More then to feast With all the Princes of the earth besides: Gonzalo told me that thou wert honest. Gas. Yes sir, And you shall find it. Fer. Shall I? Gas. All my follies Be else recorded to my shame. Fer. Enough, My heart is here for ever lodg'd. Gas. The Lady. Fer. The place admits no time to utter all, But Gaspero if thou wilt prove my friend, I'le say thou artâ Gas. Your servant: I conceive ye, Wee'll choose some fitter leisure. Fer. Never man Was (in a moment) or more bless'd, or wretched. Exeunt. Enter Hyparcha, (placing two chaires) Antinous, and Erota. Er. Leave us. Hy. I shall. Ex. Er. Antinous sit downe. Ant. Madam: Er. I say sit downe: I do command you sit; For looke what honour thou didst gaine by me, I cannot lose by it: happy Antinous, The graces, and the higher Deities Smil'd at thy birth, and still continue it: Then thinke that I (who scorne lesser examples) Must doe the like: such as do taste my power, And talke of it, with feare and reverence, Shall do the same unto the man I favour. I tel thee youth, thou hast a conquest won, Since thou cam'st home, greater then that last, Which dignified thy fame; greater then if Thou shouldst goe out againe, and conquer farther; For I am not asham'd to acknowledge My selfe subdued by thee. Ant. Great Ladyâ Er. Sit still, I will not heare thee else: now speake, And speake like my Antinous, like my Souldier, Whom Cupid, and not Mars, hath sent to Battle. Ant. I must (I see) be silent. Er. So thou maist: There's greater Action in it than in clamour, A looke, (if it be gratious) will begin the War, A word conclude it: then prove no Coward, Since thou hast such a friendly enemie, That teaches thee to conquer. Ant. You do amaze me Madam, I have no skill, no practice in this War, And whether you be serious, or please To make your sport on a dejected man, I cannot rightly ghesse: but be it as it will, It ir a like unhappinesse to me: My discontents beare those conditions in them, Musick. And lay me out so wretched, no designes (How ever truly promising a good) Can make me rellish ought, but a sweet-bitter, Voluntarie Exile. Musick againe Er. Why an Exile? What comfort can there be in those companions Enter Hyparcha. Which sad thoughts bring along with? Hyp. Madam. Er. Whence comes this well-tun'd sound? Hyp. I know not Madam. Er. Listen wench: What ever friendly hands they are that send it Song. Let 'em play on; they are Masters of their facultie. Doth it please you sir? Ant. According to the time. Er. Go to 'em wench, And tell 'em, we shall thanke 'em; for they have kept As good time to our disposition, as to their instruments; Unlesse Antinous shall say he loves, Enter Philander. There never can be sweeter accents uttered. Phi. Let then the heart, that did imploy those hands, Receive some small share of your thankes with them, 'Tis happinesse enough that you did like it; A fortune unto me, that I should send it In such a lucky minute; but to obtaine So gratious welcome, did exceed my hopes. Ero. Good Prince; I thanke you for it. Phi. O Madam, poure not (to fast) joyes on me, But sprinkle 'em so gently, I may stand 'em: It is enough at first, you have laid aside Those cruell angry lookes out of your eyes, With which (as with your lovely) you did strike All your beholders in an Extasie. Ero. Philander, you have long profess'd to love me, Phi. Have I but profest it Madam? Er. Nay, but heare me? Phi. More attentively, then to an Oracle. Er. And I will speake more truly, if more can be: Nor shall my language be wrapt up in Riddles, But plaine as truth it selfe: I love this Gentleman, Whose griefes has made him so uncapable Of Love, he will not heare, at least not understand it. I that have lookt with scornefull eyes on thee, And other Princes mighty in their states, And in their friends as fortunate, have now prai'd, In a petitionary kind almost, This man, this wel-deserving man, (that I must say) To looke upon this beauty, yet you see He casts his eyes rather upon the ground, Then he will turne 'em this way: Philander You looke pale; I'le talke no more. Phi. Pray go forward: I would be your Martyr, To dye thus, were immortally to live. Ero. Will you goe to him then, and speake for me? You have loved longer, but not ferventer, Know how to speake, for you have done it like An Orator, even for your selfe: then how will you for me Whom you professe to love above your selfe. Phi. The curses of dissemblers follow me Unto my grave, and if I do not so. Er. You may (as all men do) speake boldlier, better In their friends cause still, then in your owne; But speake your utmost, yet you cannot feigne, I will stand by, and blush to witnesse it. Tell him since I beheld him, I have lost The happinesse of this life, food, and rest; A quiet bosome, and the state I went with. Tell him how he has humbled the proud, And made the living, but a dead Erota. Tell him withall, that she is better pleas'd With thinking on him, then enjoying these. Tell himâPhilander, Prince; I talke in vaine To you, you do not marke me. Phi. Indeed, I do. Er. But thou dost looke so pale, As thou wilt spoyle the story in relating. Phi. Not, if I can but live to tell it. Er. It may be you have not the heart. Phi. I have a will I am sure, how e're my heart. May play the coward, but if you please, I'le trie. Er. If a kisse will strengthen thee, I give you leave To challenge it, nay, I will give it you. Phi. O that a man should taste such heavenly blisse! And be enjoyn'd to beg it for another. Er. Alas, it is a miserie I grieve To put you to, and I will suffer rather In his tyranny, than thou in mine. Phi. Nay Madam, since I cannot have your love, I will endeavour to deserve your pitty: For I had rather have within the grave Your love, then you should want it upon earth. But how can I hope, with a feeble tongue To instruct him in the rudiments of love, When your most powerfull beauty cannot worke it? Er. Do what thou wilt (Philander) the request Is so unreasonable, that I quit thee of it. I desire now no more, but the true patience, And fortitude of Lovers, with those helpes Of sighes and teares, which I think is all the Phisickâ Phi. O if he did but heare you, 'twere enough; And I will wake him from his Appoplexie. Antinous. Ant. My Lord? Phi. Nay pray, No curtesie to me, you are my Lord, (Indeed you are) for you command her heart, That commands mine: nor can you want to know it. For looke you, she that told it you in words, Explaines it now more passionately in teares; Either thou hast no heart, or a marble one, If those drops cannot melt it; prethee looke up, And see how sorrow sits within her eyes, And love the griefe she goes with (if not her) Of which thou art the parent: and never yet Was there (by nature) that thing made so stony, But it would love what ever it begot. Ant. He that begot me, did beget these cares Which are good issues, though happily by him Esteemed monsters: nay, the ill-judging world Is likely enough to give them those Characters. Phi. What's this to love, and to the Lady? he's old, Wrathfull, perverse, selfe-will'd, and full of anger, Which are his faults; but let them not be thine; He thrusts you from his love, she puls thee on, He doubts your vertues, she doth double them: O either use thy owne eyes, or take mine, And with them, my heart, then thou wilt love her, Nay, doate upon her, more then on thy duty, And men will praise thee equally for it; Neglecting her, condemne thee, as a man Unworthy such a fortune: O Antinous, 'Tis not the friendship that I beare to thee, But her command, that makes me utter this: And when I have prevail'd, let her but say, Philander, you must dye or this is nothing, It shall be done together with a breath, With the same willingnesse, I live to serve her. Er. No more Philander. Phi. All I have done, is little yet to purpose, But ere I leave him, I will perceive him blush; And make him feele the passions that I do, And every true lover will assist me in't, And lend me their sad sighs to blow it home, For Cupid wants a dart to wound this bosome. Er. No more, no more Philander, I can endure no more, Pray let him goe; go good Antinous, make peace With your owne mind, no matter though I perish. Ex.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Hyparcha, and Mochingo. Hyp. I cannot help it. Mo. Nor do I require it, The malady needs no Phisitian, Helpe hospitall people. Hyp. I am glad to heare You are so valliant. Mo. Valiant? Can any man be proud that is not valiant; Foolish woman, what wouldst thou say? thouâ I know not what to call thee. Hyp. I can you, For I can call you Coxcome, Asse, and Puppy. Mo. You do do it, I thanke you. Hyp. That you'l lose a fortune, Which a Cobler better deserves, then thou dost. Mo. Do not provoke my magnanimity, For when I am insens'd, I am insensible; Go tell thy Lady, that hath sent me word She will discard me, that I discard her, And throw a scorne upon her, which I would not, But that she does me wrong. Enter Erota, and Antinous. Ant. Do you not glory in your conquest more, To take some great man prisoner, then to kill him? And shall a Lady find lesse mercie from you, That yeilds her selfe your Captive, and for her Ransome, Will give the jewell of her life, her heart, Which she hath lockt from all men but thy selfe: For shame (Antinous) throw this dulnesse off, Art thou a man no where but in the field? Hyp. He must here Drums, and Trumpets ere he sleeps, And at this instant dreames he's in his Armour: These Iron-hearted Souldiers are so cold, Till they be beaten to a womans armes, And then they love 'em better then their owne; No Fort can hold them out. Ant. What pitty is it (Madam) that your selfe, Who are all excellence, should become so wretched, To thinke on such a wretch as griefe hath made me? Seldom despairing men looke up to heaven, Although it still speake to 'em in its glories: For when sad thoughts perplexe the mind of man, There is a plumit in the heart, that waighs, And puls us (living) to the dust we came from; Did you but see the miseries you pursue, (As I the happinesse that I avoid That doubles my afflictions) you would flye Unto some wildernesse, or to your grave, And there find better comforts then in me, For love, and cares can never dwell together. Er. They should, If thou hadst but my love, and I thy cares. Ant. What wild beast in the Desart, but would be Taught by this Tongue to leave his crueltie, Though all the beauties of the face were vail'd! But I am savager than any beast, And shall be so till Decius do arive. Whom with so much submission I have sent Under my hand, that if he do not bring His Benediction backe, he must to me Be much more crueller, then I to you. Ero. Is't but your fathers pardon you desire? An. With his love, &amp; then nothing next that, like yours. Er. Decius is come. Enter Decius. Ant. O welcome friend; If I apprehend not Too much of joy, there's comfort in thy lookes. Er. There is indeed: I prethee Decius speake it. De. How? prethee Decius? this woman's strangly alter'd. An. Why dost not speake (good friend) and tell me how The reverent blessing of my life, received My humble lines; wept he for joy? Dec. No ther's a letter will informe you more: Yet I can tell you, what I think will grieve you, The old man is in want, and angry still, And povertie is the bellowes to the Coale, More then distast from you as I imagine. Ant. What's here? how's this? It cannot be: now sure My griefes delude my senses. Er. In his lookes, I read a world of changes: Decius marke With what a sad amazement he surveies The newes: canst thou ghesse what 'tis? Dec. None good I feare. Er. I feare so too: and thenâ Ant. It is her hand. Er. Are you not well? Ant. Too well: if I were ought But Rock, this Letter would conclude my miseries, Peruse it (Lady) and resolve me then, In what a case I stand. Dec. Sir, the worst is, Your fathers lownesse, and distaste. Ant. No Decius, My sister writes, Fernando has made suite For love to her: and to expresse sincerely His constant truth, hath like a noble Gentleman, Discovered plots of treachery; contriv'd By false Gonzalo, not intending more The utter ruine of our house then generally Candies confusion. Dec. 'Tis a generous part Of young Fernando. Ant. 'Tis, and I could wish All thrift to his affections Decius. You find the summe on't Madam. Er. Yes, I do. Ant. And can you now yet think a heart opprest With such a throng of cares, can entertaine An amorous thought? love frees all toyles but one, Calamitie and it can ill agree. Er. Wil't please ye speake my doome? Ant. Alas great Lady, Why will you flatter thus a desperate man, That is quite cast away? O had you not Procured the Senates warrant to enforce My stay, I had not heard of these sad newes. What would you have me do? Er. Love me, or kill me, One word shall sentence either: for as truth Is just, if you refuse me, I am resolute Not to out-live my thraldome. Ant. Gentle Lady. Er. Say, must I live, or dye? Dec. My Lord, how can you Be so inexorable: here's occasion Of succouring your father in his wants, Securely profer'd: pray sir, entertaine it. Er. What is my sentence? Ant. What you please to have it? Er. As thou art Gentle, speake those words againe. Ant. Madam, you have prevail'd; yet give me leave Without offence, ere I resigne the interest Your heart hath in my heart, to prove your secresie. Er. Antinous, 'tis the greatest Argument Of thy affections to me. Ants. Madam, thus then, My father stands for certaine summes engag'd To treacherous Gonzalo; and 'has more 'gag'd The greatest part of his estate to him: If you receive this morgage, and procure Acquitance from Gonzalo to my father, I am what you would have me be. Er. You'l love me then? Ant. Provided (Madam) that my father know not I am an Agent for him. Er. If I faile In this, I am unworthy to be lov'd. Ant. Then (with your favour) thus I seale my truth, To day, and Decius witnesse how unchangingly I shall still love Erota. Er. Thou hast quickned A dying heart Antinous. Dec. This is well: Much happinesse to both. Enter Hyparcha Hyp. The Lord Gonzalo Attends you Madam. Er. Comes as we could wish, Withdraw Antinous, here's a Closset, where You may partake his errand; let him enter. Enter Gonzalo Ant. Madam you must be wary. Ex. Er. Feare it not, I will be ready for him; to entertaine him With smiling welcome: Noble sir, you take Advantage of the time; it had been fit Some notice of your presence, might have fashion'd A more prepared state. Gonz. Do ye mocke me Madam? Er. Trust me, you wrong your judgement, to repute My gratitude a fault: I have examin'd Your portly carriage, and will now confesse It hath not slightly won me. Gonz. The wind's turn'd; I thought 'twould come to this: it pleas'd us Madam, At our last interview, to mention love, Have you consider'd on't? Er. With more then common Content: but sir, if what you spake, you meant, (As I have cause to doubt) thenâ Gonz. What, (sweet Lady?) Er. Methinks me should lay by this forme of statelinesse. Loves courtship is familiar, and for instance, See what a change it hath begot in me, I could talke humbly now, as Lovers use. Gonz. And I: and I: we meet in one selfe-center, Of blest consent. Er. I hope my weakenesse sir, Shall not deserve neglect: but if it prove so, I am not the first Lady has been ruin'd By being too credulous: you will smart for't one day. Gon. Angell-like-Lady, let me be held a villaine, If I love not sincerely. Er. Would I knew it? Gonz. Make proofe by any fit command. Er. What, do ye meane to marry me? Gonz. How? meane? nay more, I meane To make you Empresse of my earthly fortunes, Regent of my desires, for did ye covet To be a reall Queene, I could advance you. Er. Now I perceive you slight me, and would make me More simple then my sexes frailety warrants. Gon. But say your mind, and you shall be a Queene. Er. On those conditions, call me yours. Gon. Enough, But are we safe? Er. Assuredly. Gon. In short, Yet Lady first be plaine: would you not choose Much rather to prefer your own Sun-rising, Then any's else though ne're so neere entituled By bloud, or right of birth? Er. 'Tis a question Needs not a resolution. Gonz. Good: what if I set the Crowne of Candy on your head? Er. I were a Queene indeed then. Gon. Madam, know There's but a boy 'twixt you, and it: suppose him Transhap'd into an Angell. Er. Wise Gonzalo, I cannot but admire thee. Gonz. 'Tis worth thinking on: Besides your husband shall be Duke of Venice. Er. Gonzalo, Duke of Venice? Gonz. Ye are mine ye say. Er. Pish: you but dally with me; and would lull me In a rich golden dreame. Gonz. You are too much distrustfull of my truth. Er. Then you must give me leave to apprehend The meanes, and manner how. Gonz. Why thusâ Er. You shall not, We may be over-heard; Affaires and counsels Of such high nature, are not to be trusted Not to the Aire it selfe, you shall in writing, Draw out the full designe; which if effected, I am as I professe. Gonz. O I applaud Your ready care, and secresie. Er. Gonzalo, There is a bar yet, twixt our hopes and us, And that must be remov'd. Gonz. What is't? Er. Old Cassilane. Gonz. He? feare not him: I build upon his ruines Already. Er. I would find a smoother course To shift him off. Gonz. As how? Er. Wee'l talke in private, I have a ready plot. Gonz. I shall adore you. Exeunt. Enter Fernando, and Annophil. Fer. Madam, although I hate unnoble practices, And therefore have perform'd no more then what I ought, for honours safety: yet Annophil, Thy love hath been the spur, to urge me forward For speedier diligence. Anno. Sir your owne fame And memory will best reward themselves. Fer. All gaine is losse (sweet beauty) if I misse My comforts here: The brother and the sister Have double conquer'd me, but thou maist triumph. Anno. Good sir, I have a father. Fer. Yes, a brave one; Could'st thou obscure thy Beauty, yet the happinesse Of being but his daughter, were a dowre Fit for a Prince: what say ye? An. You have deserv'd As much as I should grant. Fer. By this faire hand I take possession. Anno. What in words I dare not, Imagine in my silence. Fer. Thou art all vertue. Enter Cassilanes, and Arcanes, Cas. I'le tell thee how: Baldwin the Emperour, Pretending title, more through tyranny, Then right of conquest, or descent, usurp'd The stile of Lord o're all the Grecian Islands, And under colour of an amity With Creet, preferd the Marquesse Mountferato To be our Governor; the Cretians vex'd By the ambitious Turkes, in hope of aide From the Emperour, received for Generall, This Mountferato; he (the wars appeased) Plots with the state of Venice, and takes money Of them for Candy: they paid well, he steales Away in secret; since which time, that right The state of Venice claimes o're Candy, is By purchase, not inheritance, or Conquest: And hence growes all our quarrell. Arc. So a usurer Or Lumbard-Jew, might with some bags of trash, Buy halfe the Westerne world. Cas. Money Arcanes Is now a God on earth: it cracks virginities, And turnes a Christian, Turke; Bribes justice, cut-throats honour, does what not? Arc. Not captives Candy. Cas. Nor makes thee dishonest, Nor me a CowardâNow sir, here is homely, But friendly entertainment. Fer. Sir, I find it. Arc. And like it, do ye not? Fer. My repaire speakes for me. Cas. Fernando we were speaking offâhow this? Enter Gonzalo, and Gaspero, with a Casket. Gon. Your friend, and servant. Cas. Creditors, my Lord, Are Masters and no Servants: as the world goes, Debters are very slaves to those to whom They have been beholding to; in which respect, I should feare you Gonzalo. Gon. Me my Lord? You owe me nothing. Cas. What, nor love, nor money? Gon. Yes, love, I hope not money. Cas. All this braverie, Will scarcely make that good. Gonz. 'Tis done already: See sir, your Morgage which I only took, In case you and your son had in the wars Miscarried: I yeild it up againe: 'tis yours. Cas. Are ye so conscionable? Gon. 'Tis your owne. Cas. Pish, pish, I'le not receive what is not mine, That were a dangerous businesse. Gon. Sir, I am paid for't, The summes you borrowed, are return'd; The bonds Cancell'd, and your acquittance formerly seal'd: Looke here sir, Gaspero is witnesse to it. Gas. My honoured Lord, I am. Gon. My Lord Fernando, Arcanes and the rest, you all shall testifie, That I acquit Lord Cassilane for ever, Of any debts to me. Gas. 'Tis plaine and ample: Fortune will once againe smile on us fairely. Cas. But hearke ye, hearke ye, if you be in earnest, Whence comes this bounty? or whose is't? Gon. In short, The great Erota, by this Secretary, Returned me my full due. Cas. Erota? why Should she do this? Gon. You must aske her the cause, She knowes it best. Cas. So ho; Arcanes, none But women pitty us? soft-hearted women, I am become a brave fellow now, Arcanes, Am I not? Arc. Why sir, if the gracious Princesse Have tooke more speciall notice of your services, And meanes to be more thankfull than some others, It were an injury to gratitude, To disesteeme her favours. Anno. Sir she ever For your sake most respectively lov'd me. Cas. The Senate, and the body of this Kingdom, Are herein (let me speake it without arrogance) Beholding to her: I will thanke her for it; And if she have reserv'd a meanes whereby I may repay this bounty with some service, She shall be then my Patronesse: come sirs, Wee'l taste a cup of wine together now. Gonz, Fernando, I must speake with you in secret. Fer. You shallâNow Gaspero, all's well. Gas. There's newes You must be acquainted with. Come, there is no master-peece in Art, like Policie.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Fernando, and Michael. Fer. The Senate is inform'd at full. Mi. Gonzalo. Dreames not of my arivall yet. Fer. Nor thinkes 'Tis possible his plots can be discover'd: He fats himselfe with hopes of Crownes, and Kingdoms, And laughes securely, to imagine how He meanes to gull all but himselfe: when truly, None is so grosely gull'd as he. Mich. There was never A more arch villain. Fer. Peace, the Senate comes. Enter Porphino, Pos. Senators, and Gaspero, Attend. Por. How closely, Treason cloakes it selfe in formes Of Civill honesty? Pos. And yet how palpably Does heaven reveale it? Fer. Gratious Lords. Gas. The Embassadour, Lord Paulo Michael, Advocate To the great Duke of Venice. Por. You are most welcome, Your Master is a just and noble Prince. Mic. My Lords, he bad me say; that you may know How much he scornes, and (as good Princes ought) Defies base indirect and godlesse treacheries; To your more Sacred wisdomes he refers The punishment due to the false Gonzalo, Or else to send him home to Venice. Pos. Herein The Duke is royall: Gaspero the Prince Of Cyprus answer'd he would come. Gas. My Lords, He will not long be absent Enter Philander, and Melitus. Porp. You Fernando, Have made the State your debter: worthy Prince, We shall be sutors to you for your presence, In hearing, and determining of matters Greatly concerning Candy. Phi. Fathers, I am A stranger. Pos. Why, the cause (my Lord) concernes A stranger: please you seat your selfe. Phi. How e're Unfit, since you will have it so (my Lords) You shall command me. Por. You my Lord Fernando, With the Ambassador, withdraw a while. Fer. My Lords, we shall. Ex. Pos. Melitus, and the Secretary, Give notice to Gonzalo, that the Senate Requires his presence. Ex. Gas. and Mel. Phi. What concernes the businesse? Enter Cas. and Arca. Por. Thus noble Princeâ Cas. Let me alone, thou troublest me, I will be heard. Arc. You know not what you doe. Pos. Forbeare: who's he that is so rude? whats he that dares To interrupt our counsels? Cas. One that has guarded, Those Purple roabes from Cankers worse then Moaths, One that hath kept your fleeces on your backs, That would have been snatch'd from you: but I see 'Tis better now to be a dog, a Spanniell In times of Peace, then boast the brused scars, Purchas'd with losse of bloud in noble wars: My Lords, I speake to you. Por. Lord Cassilane, We know not what you meane. Cas. Yes, you are set Upon a bench of justice; and a day Will come (heare this, and quake ye potent great ones) When you your selves shall stand before a judge, Who in a paire of scales will weigh your actions, Without abatement of one graine: as then You would be found full weight, I charge ye fathers Let me have justice now. Pos. Lord Cassilane, What strange distemperature provokes distrust Of our impartiality? be sure Wee'l flatter no mans injuries. Cas. 'Tis well; You have a Law (Lords) that without remorse Dooms such as are beleapred with the curse Of foule ingratitude unto death. Por. We have. Cas. Then do me justice. Enter Antinous, Decius, Erota, Hyparcha. Dec. Mad-man, whether run'st thou? Ant. Peace Decius, I am deafe. Hyp. Will you forget Your greatnesse and your modesty? Er. Hyparcha leave, I will not heare, Ant. Lady; great, gentle, Lady. Er. Prethee young-man forbeare to interrupt me, Triumph not in thy fortunes; I will speake. Pos. More uproares yet; who are they that disturb us? Cas. The viper's come; his feares have drawn him hether, And now (My Lords) be Chronicled for ever, And give me justice against this vile Monster, This bastard of my bloud. Er. 'Tis justice fathers, I sue for too: and though I might command it. (If you remember Lords, whose child I was) Yet I will humbly beg it; this old wretch 'Has forfeited his life to me. Cas. Tricks, tricks; Complots, devices, 'twixt these paire of young-ones, To blunt the edge of your well temper'd Swords, Wherewith you strike offendors, (Lords) but I Am not a baby to be fear'd with bug-beares, 'Tis justice I require. Er. And I. Ant. You speak too tenderly; and too much, like your self To meane a cruelty; which would make monstrous Your Sexe: yet for the loves sake, which you once Pleas'd to pretend, give my griev'd father leave To vrge his owne revenge; you have no cause For yours: keep peace about ye. Cas. Will you heare me? Phi. Here's some strange novelty. Pos. Sure we are mock'd, Speake one at once: say wherein hath your Son Transgress'd the Law? Cas. O the grosse mists of dulnesse; Are you this Kingdomes Oracles, yet can be So ignorant? first heare, and then consider, That I begot him, gave him birth and life, And education, were I must confesse, But duties of a father: I did more; I taught him how to manage Armes, to dare An Enemy; to court both death and dangers; Yet these were but additions to compleate A well accomplish'd Souldier: I did more yet. I made him chiefe Commander in the field Next to my selfe, and gave him the full prospect Of honour, and preferment; train'd him up In all perfections of a martiallist: But he unmindfull of his gratitude, You know with what contempt of my deserts, First kick'd against mine honour, scorn'd all My services; then got the palme of glory Unto himselfe: yet not content with this, He (lastly) hath conspir'd my death, and sought Means to engage me to this Lady's debt, Whose bounty, all my whole estate could never Give satisfaction too: now honoured fathers, For this cause only, if your Law be law, And you the Ministers of justice; then Thinke of this strange ingratitude in him. Phi. Can this be so Antinous? Ant, 'Tis all true, Nor hath my much wrong'd father limn'd my faults In colours halfe so black, as in themselves, My guilt hath dyed them: were there mercy left, Yet mine owne shame would be my Executioner: Lords, I am guilty. Er. Thou beliest Antinous, Thine innocence: alas (my lords) hee's desperate, And talkes he knowes not what: you must not credit His lunacy; I can my selfe disprove This accusation: Cassilane, be yet More mercifull; I beg it. Cas. Time, nor fate, The world, or what is in it, shall not alter My resolution; he shall dye. Er. The Senats Prayers; or weeping Lovers, shall not alter My resolution: thou shalt dye. Ant. Why Madam, Are ye all Marble? Pos. Leave your shifts Antinous, What plead you to your fathers accusation? Ant. Most fully guilty. Pos. You have doom'd your selfe, We cannot quit you now. Cas. A burthen'd conscience Will never need a hang-man: hadst thou dar'd To have denide it, then this Sword of mine Should on thy head have prov'd thy tongue a lyar. Er. Thy sword? wretched old man, thou hast liv'd too long To carry peace or comfort to thy grave; Thou art a man condemn'd: my Lords this tyrant Had perish'd but for me, I still suppli'd His miserable wants; I sent his daughter Mony to buy him food; the bread he eate, Was from my purse: when he (vaingloriously) To dive into the peoples hearts, had pawn'd His birth-right, I redeemed it, sent it to him, And for requitall, only made my suite, That he would please to new receive his son Into his favour, for whose love I told him I had been still so friendly: But then he As void of gratitude, as all good nature, Distracted like a mad man, poasted hether To pull this vengeance on himselfe, and us; For why, (my Lords) since by the Law, all meanes Is blotted out of your commission, As this hard hearted father hath accus'd Noble Antinous, his unblemished Son, So I accuse this father, and crave judgement. Cas. All this is but deceit, meere trifles forg'd By combination to defeat the processe Of Justice, I will have Antinous life. Arc. Sir, what do ye meane? Er. I will have Cassilane's. Ant. Cunning and cruell Lady, runs the streame Of your affections this way? have you not Conquest enough by treading on my grave? Unlesse you send me thether in a shrowd Steept in my fathers bloud? as you are woman, As the protests of love you vow'd were honest; Be gentler to my father. Er. Cassilane, Thou hast a heart of flint: let my intreates, My teares, the Sacrifice of griefes unfained, Melt it: yet be a father to thy son, Unmaske thy long besotted judgement, see A low obedience kneeling at the feet Of nature: I beseech you. Cas. Pish, you cosen Your hopes: your plots are idle: I am resolute. Er. Antinous, urge no further. Ant. Hence thou Sorcery Of a beguiling softnesse, I will stand, Like the earths Center, unmoved; Lords your breath Must finish these divisions: I confesse Civility doth teach I should not speake Against a Lady of her birth, so high As great Erota, but her injuries And thankelesse wrongs to me, urge me to cry Alowd for justice, Fathers. Dec. Whether run you? Ant. For (honoured fathers) that you all may know That I alone am not unmatchable In crimes of this condition, lest perhaps You might conceive, as yet the case appeares, That this foule staine, and guilt runs in a bloud; Before this presence, I accuse this Lady Of as much vile ingratitude to me. Cas. Impudent Traitor! Phi. Her? O spare Antinous; The world reputes thee valiant, do not foyle All thy past noblenesse with such a cowardize, As murthering innocent Ladies will stamp on thee? Ant. Brave Prince, with what unwillingnesse I force Her follies, and in those her sin, be witnesse, All these about me: she is bloudy minded, And turnes the justice of the Law to rigor: It is her cruelties, not I accuse her: Shall I have Audience? Er. Let him speake my Lords. Dec. Your memory will rot. Ant. Cast all your eyes On this, what shall I call her? truthlesse woman, When often in my discontents, the sway Of her unruly bloud, her untam'd passion, (Or name it as you list) had houre by houre Sollicited my love, she vow'd at last She could not, would not live unlesse I granted What she long sued for: I in tender pitty, To save a Lady of her birth, from ruine. Gave her her life, and promis'd to be hers: Nor urg'd I ought from her, but secresie, And then enjoyn'd her to supply such wants As I perceiv'd my fathers late engagements Had made him subject to; what, shall I heape up Long repetitions? she to quit my pitty, Not only hath discover'd to my father What she had promis'd to conceale, but also Hath drawne my life into this fatall forfeit; For which, since I must dye, crave a like Equality of justice against her, Not that I covet bloud, but that she may not Practice this art of falsehood on some other, Perhaps more worthy of her love hereafter. Por. If this be trueâ Er. My Lords, be as the Law is, Indifferent, upright, I do plead guilty: Now sir, what glory have you got by this? 'Las man, I meant not to outlive thy doome; Shall we be friends in death? Cas. Heare me, the villaine Scandals her, honour'd Lords. Er. Leave off to doate, And dye a wise man. Ant. I am over-reach'd, And master'd in my own resolution. Phi. Will ye be wilfull Madam? here's the curse Of loves disdaine. Cas. Why sit you like dumb Statues? Demur no longer. Pos. Cassilane, Erota, Antinous, death ye aske; and 'tis your doomes, You in your follies liv'd, dye in your follies. Cas. I am reveng'd, and thanke you for it. Er. Yes, and I: Antinous hath been gratious. Ant. Sir, may I presume to crave a blessing from you Before we part. Cas. Yes, such a one as Parents Bestow on cursed sons now, now, I laugh To see how those poore younglings are both cheated Of life and comfort: looke ye looke ye, Lords, I go but some ten minutes (more or lesse) Before my time, but they have finely coz'nd Themselves of many, many hopefull yeares Amidst their prime of youth and glory; now Enter Annoph. My vengeance is made ful. Welcome my joy, Thou comst to take a seasonable blessing From thy halfe buried fathers hand; I am dead Already girle, and so is she and he, We all are wormes-meat now. Anno. I have heard all; Nor shall you dye alone: Lords on my knees I beg for justice too. Porp. 'Gainst whom, for what? Ann. First let me be resolv'd; does the Law favour None, be they ne're so mighty? Porp. Not the greatest. Ann. Then justly I accuse of foule ingratitude (My Lords) you of the Senate all, not one Excepted. Pos., Porp. Us? Phil. Annophillâ Ann. You are the Authors Of this unthrifty bloud-shed; when your enemies Came marching to your gates, your children suck'd not Safe at their mothers breasts, your very Cloysters Were not secure, your starting-holes of refuge Not free from danger, nor your lives your owne: In this most desperate Extasie, my father, This aged man, not onely undertook To guard your lives, but did so; and beat off The daring foe; for you he pawn'd his lands, To pay your souldiers, who without their pay Refus'd to strike a blow: but (Lords) when peace Was purchas'd for you, and victorie brought home; Where was your gratitude, who in your Coffers Hoarded the rustie treasure which was due To my unminded father? he was glad To live retir'd in want, in penurie, Whilst you made feasts of surfeit, and forgot Your debts to him: The sum of all is this, You have been unthankfull to him; and I crave The rigor of the Law against you all. Cas. My Royall spirited daughter! Ero. Annophill Thou art a worthy wench; let me embrace thee. Ann. Lords, why doe ye keep your seats? they are no places For such as are offenders. Pos. Though our ignorance Of Cassilanes engagements might asswage Severity of justice, yet to shew How no excuse should smooth a breach of Law, I yeeld me to the triall of it. Porp. So must I: Great Prince of Cyprus, you are left The onely Moderator in this difference; And as you are a Prince be a Protector To wofull Candy. Phil. What a Scene of miserie Hath thine obdurate frowardnesse (old man) Drawne on thy Countries bosome? and for that Thy proud ambition could not mount so high As to be stil'd thy Countries onely Patron, Thy malice hath descended to the depth Of hell, to be renowned in the Title Of the destroyer? dost thou yet perceive What curses all posterity will brand Thy grave with? that at once hast rob'd this kingdome Of honour and of safety. Erot. Children yet unborne Will stop their eares when thou art nam'd. Arc. The world will be too little to containe The memorie of this detested deed; The Furies will abhorre it. Dec. What the sword Could not enforce, your peevish thirst of honour (A brave, cold, weak, imaginarie fame) Hath brought on Candy: Candy groans, not these That are to die. Phil. 'Tis happinesse enough For them, that they shall not survive to see The wounds wherewith thou stab'st the land that gave Thee life and name. Dec. 'Tis Candy's wrack shall feeleâ Cas. The mischief of your folly. Porp., Pos. Annophillâ Ann. I will not be entreated. Cas. Prethee Annophill. Ann. Why would ye urge me to a mercy which You in your selfe allow not? Cas. 'Tis the Law, That if the party who complaines, remit The offender, he is freed: is't not so Lords? Porp., Pos. 'Tis so. Cas. Antinous, By my shame observe What a close witch-craft popular applause is: I am awak'd, and with cleare eyes behold The Lethargie wherein my reason long Hath been be-charm'd: Live, live, my matchlesse sonne, Blest in thy fathers blessing; much more blest In thine owne vertues: let me dew thy cheeks With my unmanly teares: Rise, I forgive thee: And good Antinous, if I shall be thy father Forgive me: I can speak no more. Ant. Deare Sir, You new beget me nowâMadam your pardon, I hartily remit you. Ero. I as freely Discharge thee Cassilane. Ann. My gracious Lords, Repute me not a blemish to my Sex, In that I strove to cure a desperate evill With a more violent remedy: your lives, Your honours are your owne. Phil. Then with consent Be reconcil'd on all sides: Please you fathers To take your places. Pos. Let us againe ascend, With joy and thankfulnesse to heaven: And now To other businesse Lords. Enter Gaspero, and Melitus, with Gonzalo. Mel. Two howres and more Sir, The Senate hath been set. Gonz. And I not know it? Who sits with them? Mel. My Lord, the Prince of Cyprus. Gonz. Gaspero, VVhy how comes that to passe? Gas. Some waighty cause I warrant you. Gonz. Now Lords the businesse? ha? VVho's here, Erota? Porp. Secretarie doe your charge Upon that Traitor. Gonz. Traytor? Gas. Yes, Gonzalo, Traitor, Of treason to the peace and state of Candy, I doe arrest thee. Gonz. Me? thou dog? Enter Fernando and Michael. Mich. With License From this grave Senate, I arrest thee likewise Of Treason to the State of Venice. Gonz. Ha? Is Michael here? nay then I see I am undone. Ero. I shall not be your Queen, Your Dutchesse, or your Empresse. Gonz. Dull, dull braine. O I am fool'd? Gas. Look Sir, do you know this hand? Mic. Do you know this Seale? First (Lords) he writes to Venice, To make a perfect league, during which time He would in private keep some Troops in pay, Bribe all the Centinells throughout this kindom, Corrupt the Captaines; at a Banquet poyson The Prince, and greatest Peeres, and in conclusion Yield Candy slave to Venice. Gas. Next, he contracted With the Illustrious Princesse, the Lady Erota, In hope of marriage with her, to deliver All the Venetian gallantry, and strength, Upon their first arrivall, to the mercy Of her and Candy. Erot. This is true Gonzalo. Gon. Let it be true: what then? Pos. My Lord Ambassadour, What's your demand? Mich. As likes the State of Candy, Either to sentence him as he deserves Here, or to send him like a slave to Venice. Porph. We shall advise upon it. Gonz. O the devills, That had not thrust this trick into my pateâ A Politician foole? destruction, plague Candy and Venice both. Pos., Porp. Away with him. Mel. Come sir, Ile see you safe. Exeunt. Gonz. Mel. Ero. Lords, e're you part Be witnesse to another change of wonder; Antinous, now be bold, before this presence, Freely to speak, whether or no I us'd The humblest meanes affection could contrive, To gaine thy love. Ant. Madam, I must confesse it, And ever am your servant. Ero. Yes Antinous, My servant, for my Lord thou shalt be never: I here disclaim the interest thou hadst once In my too passionate thoughts. Most noble Prince, If yet a relique of thy wonted flames Live warme within thy bosome, then I blush not To offer up the assurance of my faith, To thee that hast deserv'd it best. Phil. O Madam, You play with my calamity. Ero. Let heaven Record my truth for ever. Phil. With more joy Then I have words to utter, I accept it. I also pawne you mine. Ero. The man that in requitall Of noble and un-sought affection Growes cruell, never lov'd, nor did Antinous. Yet herein (Prince) ye are beholding to him; For his neglect of me humbled a pride, Which to a vertuous wife had been a Monster. Phil. For which Ile ranke him my deserving friend. Ant. Much comfort dwell with you, as I could wish To him I honour most. Cas. O my Antinous, My owne, my owne good son. Fer. One suit I have to make. Phil. To whom Fernando? Fer. Lord Cassilane to you. Cas. To me? Fer. This Lady Hath promised to be mine. Ann. Your blessing sir; Brother your love. Ant. You cannot sir bestow her On a more noble gentleman. Cas. Saist thou so? Antinous I confirm it. Here Fernando, Live both as one; she is thine. Ant. And herein sister, I honour you for your wise setled love. This is a day of Triumph, all Contentions Are happily accorded: Candy's peace Secur'd, and Venice vow'd a worthy friend. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
