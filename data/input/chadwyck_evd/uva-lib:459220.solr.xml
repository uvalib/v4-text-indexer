      <field name="fulltext">[Enter Baleus Prolocutor] Baleus Prolocutor In ych commen welthe most hygh prehemynence Is due unto lawes for soch commodyte As is had by them. For as Cicero geveth sentence: Where as is no lawe can no good order be In nature, in people, in howse, nor yet in citie. The bodyes above are underneth a lawe; Who coulde rule the worlde were it not undre awe? Lyke as Chrysippus full clarkely doth dyffyne, Lawe is a teacher of matters necessary, A knowledge of thynges both naturall and devyne, Perswadynge all truth, dysswadynge all injury, A gyfte of the Lorde, devoyde of all obprobry, An wholesom doctryne of men dyscrete and wyse, A grace from above and a very heavenly practyse. Our heavenly maker, mannys lyvynge to dyrect, The lawes of Nature, of Bondage, and of Grace, Sent into thys worlde with vycyousnesse infect, In all ryghteousnesse to walke before hys face. But Infydelyte so worketh in every place That under the heavens no thynge is pure and cleane, So moch the people to hys perverse wayes leane. The lawe of Nature hys fylthy dysposycyon Corrupteth with ydolles and stynkynge Sodometry, The lawe of Moses with Avaryce and Ambycyon He also poluteth; and ever contynually Christes lawe he defyleth with cursed hypocresy And with false doctryne as wyll apere in presence To the edyfyenge of thys Christen audyence. Of Infydelyte God wyll hymself revenge With plages of water, of wyldefyre, and of sworde. And of hys people due homage he wyll chalenge Ever to be knowne for their God and good lorde After that he hath those lawes agayne restorde To their first bewtye commyttynge them to fayth. He is now in place: marke therfor what he sayth. [Exit.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A COMEDY CONCERNYNGE THRE LAWES, OF NATURE, MOSES, AND CHRIST, CORRUPTED BY THE SODOMYTES, PHARYSEES AND PAPYSTES. Compyled by Johan Bale. Anno 1538. Actus Primus [Enter Deus Pater, Naturae Lex, Moseh Lex, and Christi Lex.] Deus Pater I am Deus Pater, a substaunce invysyble, All one with the Sonne and Holy Ghost in essence. To Angell and Man I am incomprehensyble, A strength infynyte, a ryghteousnesse, a prudence, A mercy, a goodnesse, a truth, a lyfe, a sapyence. In heaven and in earth we made all to our glory Man ever havynge in a specyall memory. Man, I saye agayne, whych is our owne elect, Our chosen creature, and servaunt over all, Above the others peculyarly select To do us homage and on our name to call Acknowledgynge us for hys author princypall, Indued hym we have with gyftes of specyall grace And lawes wyll we sende to governe hym in place. Steppe fourth ye thre lawes for gydaunce of Mankynde Whom most inteyrly in hart we love and faver, And teach hym to walke accordynge to our mynde, In clennes of lyfe and in a gentyll behaver. Depely instruct hym our mysteryes to saver, By the workes of fayth all vyces to seclude And preserve in hym our godly symylytude. Naturae Lex Of duty we ought alwayes to be obeysaunt To your commaundement for just it is and plesaunt. Moseh Lex Your preceptes are true and of perpetuall strength, On justyce grounded as wyll apere at length. Christi Lex Proudenesse ye abhorre with lyke inconvenyentes. All they are cursed wych go from your commaundementes. Deus Pater Our lawes are all one, though yow do thre apere, Lyke wyse as our wyll is all one in effect. But bycause that Man in hymself is not clere, To tyme and persone as now we have respect; And as thre teachers to hym we yow dyrect Though ye be but one, in token that we are thre Dystyncte in persone and one in the deyte. Naturae Lex We consydre that for as concernynge Man Foure severall tymes are moch to be respected: Of innocency first, of hys transgressyon than, Than the longe season wherin he was afflycted, Fynally the tyme wherin he was redemed: Of pleasure is the first, the seconde of exyle, The third doth ponnysh, the forth doth reconcyle. Moseh Lex Whan Angell was made thys lawe he had by and by, To serve yow hys lorde, and with laudes to prosecute. Thys lawe was geven Man, in tyme of innocency, In no wyse to eate of the forbydden frute. These two lawes broken, both they were destytute Of their first fredome, to their most hygh decaye, Tyll your only sonne ded mannys whole raunsome paye. Christi lex Whan Angell in heaven and Man in paradyse Those lawes had broken, the lawe of wycked Sathan Impugned your lawes by craft and subtyle practyse. Where yow sayd Eate not! he sayd unto the woman âEate! Ye can not dye: as godes ye shall be than.â By thys first of all your [lawes] Man proved true And Sathans lawe false, whych he now dayly rue. Deus Pater Lete hym than beware how he our lawes neglect. Only to Angell and Man we gave lyberte And they onlye fell becommynge a frowarde sect Not by our mocyon but their owne vanyte. For that we gave them to their felycyte Abused they have, to their perpetuall evyll. Man is now mortall, and Angell become a devyll. Lose Man we wyll not, though he from us doth fal; Our love towardes hym wyll be moch better than so. Thu lawe of Nature, teache thu hym first of all Hys lorde God to knowe, and that is ryght to do; Charge and enforce hym in the wayes of us to go, Thu lawe of Moses; and Christes lawe fynally, Rayse hym and save hym to our perpetuall glory. Naturae Lex For tyme of exyle than I must be hys teacher. Deus Pater Yea, for thre ages both gyde and governer: From Adam to Noah, from Noah to Abraham, And than to Moses whych is the sonne of Amram. Naturae Lex Where must I remayne for the tyme I shall be here? Deus Pater In the hart of Man hys conscyence for to stere To ryghteouse lyvynge and to a just beleve. In token wherof, thys hart to the I geve. Hic pro suo signo cor ministrat. Thu shalt want no grace to confort hym with all, If he to the fayth of my first promyse fall. Moseh Lex Then my course is next for tyme of hys ponnishment. Deus Pater For thre ages more to the must he consent: From Moses to David, from thens to the Jewes exyle, And so fourth to Christ, whych wyll Man reconcyle. Moseh Lex Where shall I, swete Lorde, for that same season dewell? Deus Pater With soch harde rulers as wyll the people compell Our mynde to fulfyll without vayne gaudes or fables. For a sygne of thys, holde these same stony tables. Hic pro signo lapideas dat ei tabulas. All they that observe our lawes invyolablye Shall every where prospere, increase and multyplye. Christi Lex Then I perceyve well my course is last of all. Deus Pater What though it be so? Yet art thu pryncypall; [Over all] the worlde thy beames shalt thu extende, And styll contynue tyll the worlde be at an ende. Christi Lex Where shall I, father, for that same tyme persever? Deus Pater With the faythfull sort must thu contynue ever. Thu shalt my people returne from farre exyle And for evermore to my grace reconcyle. Take thys precyouse boke for a token evydent, A seale of my covenaunt, and a lyvynge testament. Hic pro signo dat ei novum testamentum. They that beleve it shall lyve for evermore, And they that do not wyll rue their folye sore. Blessed shall he be that yow, my lawes, wyll kepe In cytie and felde, whether he do worke or slepe. Hys wyfe shall encreace; hys land shall frutyfye; And of hys enemyes he shall have vyctorye; The skye wyll geve rayne whan seasonable tyme shall be; The workes of hys handes shall have prosperyte. Cursed shall they be that wyll not our lawes fulfyll, Without and within, at market and at myll. Of corne and cattell they shall have non increase; Within their owne howse shall sorowes never cease; Never shall they be without byle, botche or blayne; The pestylence and poxe wyll worke them deadly payne. Shewe thys unto Man and byd hym take good hede Of our ryghteousnesse to stande alwayes in drede. We vysyte the synne and the great abhomynacyon Of the wycked sort to thirde and fort generacyon. Thu, lawe of Nature, instruct hym first of all; Thu, lawe of Moses, correct hym for hys fall; And thu, lawe of Christ, geve hym a godly mynde, Rayse hym unto grace, and save hym from the fynde. Our heavenly blessynge be with yow, everychone. Omnes simul. All prayse and glory to your majeste alone. Christi Lex Here styll to tarry I thynke it be your mynde. Naturae Lex My offyce, ye knowe, is to instruct Mankynde. Moseh Lex Than God be with yow; we leave ye here behynde. Exeunt [all except Naturae Lex.] Finit Actus primus. Incipit Actus Secundus Naturae Lex The lawe in effect is a teacher generallâ What is to be done, and what to be layed asyde: But as touchynge me, the first lawe naturall, A knowledge I am whom God in Man doth hyde, In hys whole workynge to be to hym a gyde, To honour hys God and seke hys neybers helth, A great occasyon of peace and publyque welth. A sore charge I have, Mankynde to over se, And to instruct hym hys lorde God to obaye. That lorde of heaven graunt I may so do my dewtie That he be pleased, and Man brought to a staye. Hys bryttle nature, hys slyppernesse to waye, Moch doth provoke me; but if God set to hande He shall do full wel, for non maye hym withstande. [Enter Infidelitas as a pedlar, singing.] Infidelitas Brom, brom, brom, brom, brom. Bye brom, bye, bye. Bromes for shoes and powcherynges, Botes and buskyns for newe bromes. Brom, brom, brom. Marry, God geve ye good even, And the holyman saynt Steven Sende ye a good newe yeare. I wolde have brought ye the paxe, Or els an ymage of waxe, If I had knowne ye heare. I wyll my selfe so handle That ye shall have a candle Whan I come hyther agayne. At thys your soden mocyon, I was in soch devocyon, I had nere broke a vayne. Naturae Lex That myght have done ye smart. Infidelitas No, no, it was but a fart: For pastyme of my hart I wolde ye had it forsoth In serupp or in sowse, But for noyaunce of the howse For easement of your toth. Now have I my dreame in dede, God send me wele to spede And swete saynt Antony; I thought I shuld mete a knave, And now that fortune I have Amonge thys cumpany. Naturae Lex Why dost thu call me knave? Infidelitas I sayd I wolde be your slave, Yf your grace wolde me have, And do your worke anon. I wolde so rubbe your botes Therofe shuld from the rotes Whan ye shuld do them on ... Naturae Lex Thu art dysposed to mocke; Sone mayst thu have a knocke, If thu with me so game. Infidelitas Your mouth shall kysse my docke, Your tonge shall it unlockeâ But I saye, what is your name? Naturae Lex I am the lawe of Nature. Infidelitas I thought so by your stature, And by your auncyent gature, Ye were of soch a rature, Whan I first heard ye speke. Ye commoned with God lately, And now ye are hys bayly, Mankynde to rule dyscretely; Welcome, syr huddypeke. Naturae Lex If thu use soch vyllanye, I shall dysplease the, trulye. Infidelitas By the masse, I the defye, With thy whole cuckoldrye, And all that with the holde. Naturae Lex Why dost thu me blaspheme, And so ungodly deme? Infidelitas For by thys blessed boke I went ye had bene a coke And that made me so bolde. For a coke ones havynge age, With a face demure and sage And auncyent to beholde, As yow have here in place, With a bearde upon your face, What is he but a coke-olde? Naturae Lex Ye are dysposed to dallye, To leape and oversallye The compasse of your wytte: I counsell ye yet in season, Sumwhat to folowe reason, And gnawe upon the bytte. Infidelitas Then after our great madnesse, Lete us fall to some sadnesse, And tell me what ye intende. Naturae Lex God sent me unto Man To do the best I can To cause hym to amende. Soch creatures as want reason My rules obye yche season And that in every bordre; The sunne and mone doth move With the other bodyes above And never breake their ordre; The trees and herbes doth growe, The see doth ebbe and flowe, And varyeth not a nayle; The floudes and wholsom sprynges With other naturall thynges Their course do never fayle; The beastes and byrdes engendre, So do the fyshes tendre Accordynge to their kynde; Alonlye man doth fall From good lawes naturall By a frowarde wycked mynde. Infidelitas Now wyll I prove ye a lyar, Next cosyne to a fryar, And on the gall ye rubbe. Ye saye they folowe your lawe, And varyee not a strawe, Whych is a tale of a tubbe. The sunne ones in the clyppes, Awaye the clerenesse slyppes, And darkened is the daye; Of the planetes influence Aryseth the pestylence To manye ones decaye. Doth not the see so rage, That non can it aswage, And swellowe in towne and streate? The ayre whych geveth breathe Sumtyme infecteth to deathe By hys most pestylent heate. The beastes oft undemure, Whych were left to mannys cure, Wyll hym sumtyme devoure: Thus are your rules forgote As thynges of slendre note In creatures daye and houre. Naturae Lex It is the wyll of God To use them as a rod Of hys just ponnyshment, Whan Man doth not regarde The lorde nor hys rewarde, Nor to hys lawes consent. They never are so ronnysh But whan God doth Man ponnysh For hys unhappynesse. From God they never fall, Nor from lawes naturall, Doynge hys busynesse. Infidelitas And yow are the same lawe That kepe them undre awe By your most polytyke wytt? Naturae Lex God hath appoynted me Mankynde to overse And in hys hart to sytt; To teache hym for to knowe In the creatures hygh and lowe Hys gloryouse mageste, And on hys name to call Or power celestyall In hys necessyte; To thynke hym everlastynge And wonderfull in workynge, And that he createth all, Both governe and conserve. From them he never swerve That to soch fayth wyll fall. Infidelitas In dede here is good sport: But why do yow resort Unto thys present place? Naturae Lex Man alwayes to exhort To seke all helth and confort Of the only God of grace; First in the hartes rejoyce, And than with open voyce To worshypp hym alone, Knowledgynge hys deyte, Hys power and eternyte, Whan he shall make hys mone. Infidelitas I shall kepe ye as well from that As my grandame kept her cat From lyckynge of her creame. Naturae Lex What wylt thu kepe me fro? Tell me ere thu farther go: Me thynke thu art in a dreame. Infidelitas From causynge of Mankynde To geve to God hys mynde Or hys obedyence. Naturae Lex What is thy name? Tell me. Infidelitas Marry, Infydelyte, Whych never wyll agre To your benyvolence. Naturae Lex Thu cannyst not kepe me from man. Infidelitas Yet wyll I do the best I can To trouble ye now and than, That ye shall not prevayle. I wyll cause ydolatrye, And most vyle sodomye To worke so ongracyouslye Ye shall of your purpose fayle. Naturae Lex I defye the, wycked fynde, With thy whole venemouse kynde. God putteth now in my mynde To fle thy cumpanye. Infidelitas Ye are so blessed a Saynt, And your self so wele can paynt, That I must me acquaynt With yow, no remedye. Naturae Lex Avoyde, thu cruell enemye! I wyll non of the trulye, But shurne thy cumpanye As I wolde the devyll of hell. Exit [Naturae Lex.] Infidelitas And are ye gone in dede? Small wyttam be your spede; Except ye take good hede I wyll be next of your counsell. Now wyll I worke soch masterye, By craftes and sutyle polycye, The lawe of nature to poyson With pestylent ydolatrye And with most stynkynge sodomye, That he shall have no foyson. Where are these vyllen knaves, The devyls owne kychyn slaves, That them I can not se? I conjure yow both here, And charge ye to apere, Lyke two knaves as ye be! Sodomismus [offstage.] Ambo is a name full cleane. [as] Monachus Knowe ye not what I meane, And are so good a clarke? Infidelitas By Tetragrammaton, I charge ye, apere anon And come out of the darke. Intrant simul [Sodomismus and Idololatria.] Sodomismus Have in than, at a dash, With swash, myry annet swash; Yet maye I not be to rash For my holy orders sake, Idololatria Nor I, sonne, by my trouth. [as] Necromantic Cha caute a corage of slouth, And soch a comberouse couth, Ych wote not what to do. Infidelitas At Christmas and at Paske Ye maye daunce the devyll a maske Whyls hys great cawdron plawe. Yow soch a prati mynyon, And yow now in relygyon, Soch two I never sawe. Is not thy name Ydolatrye? Sodomismus Yes, an wholsom woman verelye, And wele seane in phylosophye; Mennys fortunes she can tell. She can by sayenge her Ave Marye, And by other charmes of sorcerye, Ease men of toth ake by and bye, Yea, and fatche the devyll from hell. She can mylke the cowe and hunte the foxe, And helpe men of the ague and poxe, So they brynge moneye to the boxe, Whan they to her make mone. She can fatch agayne all that is lost, And drawe drynke out of a rotten post, Without the helpe of the holye Ghost: In workynge she is alone. Infidelitas What, sumtyme thu wert an he! Idololatria Yea, but now ych am a she, And a good mydwyfe per De, Yonge chyldren can I charme, With whysperynges and whysshynges, With crossynges and with kyssynges, With blasynges and with blessynges, That spretes do them no harme. Infidelitas Then art thu lyke to Clisthenes, To Clodious and Euclides, Sardinapalus and Hercules, Whych themselves oft transfourmed Into a womannys lyckenes, With agylyte and quyckenes, But they had Venus syckenes, As writers have declared. Sodomismus Lete her tell fourth her matter. Idololatria With holye oyle and watter, I can so cloyne and clatter, That I can at the latter, Manye suttyltees contryve. I can worke wyles in battle, If I do ones but spattle, I can make corne and cattle, That they shall never thryve. Whan ale is in the fatt, If the bruar please me natt, The cast shall fall downe flat, And never have any strength. No man shall tonne nor bake, Nor meate in season make, If I agaynst hym take, But lose hys labour at length. Their wellys I can up drye, Cause trees and herbes to dye, And slee all pullerye Where as men doth me move. I can make stoles to daunce, And earthen pottes to praunce, That non shall them enhaunce, And do but cast my glove. I have charmes for the plowgh, And also for the cowgh; She shall geve mylke ynowgh, So longe as I am pleased. Apace the mylle shall go, So shall the credle do, And the musterde querne also, No man therwith dyseased. Infidelitas Than art thu for me fytt. Sodomismus The woman hath a wytt, And by her gere can sytt, Though she be sumwhat olde. It is myne owne swete bullye, My muskyne and my mullye, My gelover and my cullye, Yea, myne owne swetehart of golde. Infidelitas I saye yet not to bolde. Idololatria Peace, fondelinge, tush a button. Infidelitas What wylt thu fall to mutton, And playe the hungry glutton, Afore thys cumpanye? Ranke love is full of heate; Where hungry dogges lacke meate They wyll durty puddynges eate For want of befe and conye. Hygh, mynyon, for monye, As good is draffe as honye, Whan the daye is whote and sonnye, By the blessed rode of Kent. Sodomismus Saye fourth your mynde, good mother, For thys man is non other But our owne lovynge brother, And is very wele content. Idololatria I never mysse but paulter Our blessed ladyes psaulter Before saynt Savers aulter, With my bedes ones a daye. And thys is my commen cast, To heare Masse first or last, And the holy frydaye fast, In good tyme mowt I it saye. With blessynges of saynt Germyne, I wyll me so determyne That neyther foxe nor vermyne Shall do my chuckens harme. For your gese seke saynt Legearde, And for your duckes saynt Lenarde, For horse take Moyses yearde, There is no better charme. Take me a napkyn folte, With the byas of a bolte, For the healynge of a colte, No better thynge can be. For lampes and for bottes Take me saynt Wylfrides knottes, And holy saynt Thomas lottes, On my lyfe I warande ye. For the cowgh take Judas eare, With the parynge of a peare, And drynke them without feare If ye wyll have remedy. Thre syppes are for the hyckock, And six more for the chyckock; Thus maye my praty pyckock Recover by and by. If ye can not slepe but slumber, Geve otes unto saynt Uncumber, And beanes in a serten number Unto saynt Blase and saynt Blythe; Geve onyons to saynt Cutlake, And garlyke to saynt Cyryake, If ye wyll shurne the head ake, Ye shall have them at Quene hythe. A dramme of a shepes tyrdle, And good saynt Frances gyrdle, With the hamlet of an hyrdle, Are wholesom for the pyppe. Besydes these charmes afore, I have feates many more That I kepe styll in store Whome now I over hyppe. Infidelitas It is a spoart I trowe To heare how she out blowe Her witche craftes on a rowe; By the Masse I must nedes smyle. Now, I praye the, lete me knowe What sedes that thu cannyst sowe Mankynde to over throwe, And the lawe of nature begyle. Sodomismus My selfe I so behave, And am so vyle a knave As nature doth deprave And utterlye abhorre. I am soche a vyce trulye As God in hys great furye Ded ponnysh most terryblye In Sodome and in Gomorre. In the fleshe I am a fyre, And soch a vyle desyre, As brynge men to the myre Of fowle concupyscence. We two togyther beganne To sprynge and to growe in manne, As Thomas of Aquyne scanne In the fort boke of hys sentence. I dwelt amonge the Sodomytes, The Benjamytes and Madyanytes And now the popysh hypocrytes Embrace me every where. I am now become all spyrytuall, For the clergye at Rome and over all For want of wyves, to me doth fall, To God they have no feare. The chyldren of God I ded so move, That they the doughters of men ded love, Workynge soch wayes as ded not behove, Tyll the floude them over went. With Noes sonne Cham I was half joyned, Whan he hys dronken father scorned; In the Gomorytes I also reigned, Tyll the hand of God them brent. I was with Onan not unacquaynted, Whan he on the grounde hys increase shed; For me hys bretherne Joseph accused, As Genesis doth tell. David ones warned all men of us two, âDo not as mules and horses wyll do; Confounded be they that to ymages go, Those are the wayes to hell.â Both Esaye and Ezechiel, Both Hieremy and Daniel, Of us the abhomynacyons tell, With the prophetes everychon; For us two God strake with fyre and watter With battayle, with plages and fearfull matter, With paynefull exyle than at the latter, Into Egipt and Babylon. As Paule to the Romanes testyfye, The gentyles after Idolatrye Fell to soch bestyall Sodomye That God ded them forsake. Who foloweth us as he confesse The kyngedom of God shall never possesse, And as the Apocalyps expresse Shall synke to the burnynge lake. We made Thalon and Sophocles, Thamiras, Nero, Agathocles, Tiberius and Aristoteles, Themselves to use unnaturallye: I taught Aristo and Fulvius, Semiramis and Hortensius, Crathes, Hyliscus, and Pontius Beastes to abuse most monstruouslye. Infidelitas Marry, thu art the devyll hymselfe! Idololatria If ye knewe how he coulde pelfe, Ye wolde saye he were soch an elfe, As non under heaven were els. Infidelitas The fellawe is wele decked, Dysgysed and wele necked, Both knavebalde and pyepecked, He lacketh nothynge but bels. Sodomismus In the first age I beganne, And so perseverde with manne, And styll wyll if I canne, So longe as he endure. If monkysh sectes renue, And popysh prestes contynue, Whych are of my retynue, To lyve I shall be sure. Cleane marryage they forbyd, Yet can not their wayes be hyd; Men knowe what hath betyd, Whan they have bene in parell. Oft have they buryed quycke Soch as were never sycke; Full many a propre trycke, They have to helpe their quarell. In Rome to me they fall, Both byshopp and cardynall, Monke, fryre, prest and all, More ranke they are than antes. Example in Pope Julye, Whych sought to have in hys furye Two laddes, and to use them beastlye, From the Cardynall of Nantes. Infidelitas Well yow two are for my mynde, Steppe fourth and do your kynde; Leave never a poynt be hynde That maye corrupt in man The lawe wryt in hys hart: In hys flesh do thy part, Ad Sodo. And hys sowle to pervart Ad Idol. Do thu the best thu can. Here have I pratye gynnes, Both brouches, beades and pynnes, With soch as the people wynnes Unto ydolatrye Take thu part of them here, Ad Idol. Beades, rynges, and other gere, And shortlye the bestere To deceyve Man properlye. Take thys same staffe and scryppe, With a God here of a chyppe, And, good beldame, forewarde hyppe, To set fourth pylgrymage. Set thu fourth sacramentals, Ad Sodo. Saye dyrge, and synge for trentals, Stodye the Popes decretals, And mixt them with buggerage. Here is a stoole for the A ghostlye father to be To heare Benedicite, A boxe of creame and oyle. Here is a purse of rellyckes, Ad Idol. Ragges, rotten bones, and styckes, A taper with other tryckes, Shewe them in every soyle. Sodomismus I wyll corrupt Gods Image With most unlawfull usage, And brynge hym into dottage, Of all concupyscence. Idololatria Within the flesh thu art, But I dwell in the hart, And wyll the sowle pervart From Gods obedyence. Infidelitas Spare non abhomynacyon, Nor detestable fashyon, That mannys ymagynacyon By wytt maye comprehende. To quycken our spretes amonge Synge now some myry songe, But lete it not be longe, Least we to moch offende. Post cantionem Infidelitas alta voce dicetâ Oremus. Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui ad imaginem et similitudinem nostram formasti laicos, da quaesumus ut sicut eorum sudoribus vivimus ita eorum uxoribus, filiabus et domicellis perpetuo frui mereamur. Per dominum nostrum Papam. [Exeunt Sodomismus and Idololatria.] Infidelitas Now are these whoresons forth; It wyll be somwhat worth To se how they wyll wurke, The one to poyson the hart, The other the outwarde part Ingenyously wyll lurke. The lawe of Nature they wyll Infect, corrupt and spyll With their abhomynacyon, Idolatry with wyckednesse, And Sodomy with fylthynesse, To hys most utter dampnacyon. These two wyll hym so use, Ich one in their abuse, And wrappe hym in soch evyll, That by their wycked cast He shall be at the last A morsell for the devyll. Now underneth her wynges Idolatry hath kynges With their nobylyte, Both dukes, lordes, knyghtes and earles, Fayre ladyes with their pearles, And the whole commenalte. Within the bownes of Sodomye Doth dwell the spirytuall clergye, Pope, cardinall and pryst, Nonne, chanon, monke and fryre, With so many els as do desyre To reigne undre Antichrist. Detestynge matrymonye, They lyve abhomynablye, And burne in carnall lust. Shall I tell ye farther newes? At Rome for prelates are stewes Of both kyndes: thys is just. The lawe of Nature, I thynke, Wyll not be able to wynke Agaynst the assaultes of them, They havynge so hygh prelates, And so manye great estates From hens to Hierusalem. Pause now a lyttle whyle; Myne eares doth me begyle If I heare not a sounde. Yon folke hath sped, I gesseâ It is so, by the Messe! Awaye now wyll I rounde. Exit. [Enter Law of Nature afflicted with leprosy] Naturae Lex I thynke ye marvele to se soch alteracyon At thys tyme in me, whom God left here so pure. Of me it cometh not, but of mannys operacyon, Whome dayly the devyll to great synne doth allure, And hys nature is full bryttle and unsure. By hym have I gote thys fowle dysease of bodye, And as ye se here, am now throwne in a leprye. I wrought in hys hart, as God bad ernestlye, Hym oft provokynge to love God over all With the inner powers. But that false Idolatrye Hath hym perverted by slayghtes dyabolycall, And so hath Sodomye through hys abuses carnall, That he is now lost, offendynge without measure, And I corrupted, to my most hygh dyspleasure. I abhorre to tell the abusyons bestyall That they daylye use whych boast their chastyte; Some at the aulter to incontynency fall, In confessyon some full beastly occupyed be. Amonge the close nonnes reigneth thys enormyteâ Soch chyldren slee they as they chaunce for to have, And in their prevyes provyde them of their grave. Ye Christen rulers, se yow for thys a waye: Be not illuded by false hypocresye; By the stroke of God the worlde wyll els decaye. Permyt prestes rather Gods lawfull remedye, Than they shuld incurre most bestyall Sodomye. Regarde not the Pope, nor yet hys whorysh kyngedom For he is the master of Gomor and of Sodome. With Man have I bene whych hath me thus defyled With Idolatrye and uncleane Sodomye, And worthye I am from God to be exyled. Pytie me yet, Lorde, of thy most bownteouse mercye: I wyll fourth and mourne tyll thu sende remedye. Promyse hast thu made to a gloryouse lyberte To brynge heaven and earth: than wylt thu, I trust, restore me. [Exit.] [Finit Actus Secundus.] Incipit Actus Tertius [Enter Moseh Lex.] Moseh Lex The lorde perceyvynge hys first lawe thus corrupted With uncleane vyces, sent me, hys lawe of Moses, To se hym for synne substancyallye corrected, And brought in agayne to a trade of godlynes. For I am a lawe of rygour and of hardenes: I strayghtly commaunde, and if it be not done, I thretten, I curse, and slee in my anger sone. To God I requyre a perfyght obedyence, Condempnynge all soch as do it not in effect. I shewe what synne is; I burden sore mannys conscyence; To hym am I death whan hys lyfe is infect. Yet if he take hede, to Christ I hym dyrect, Forgevenesse to have, with lyght, helth and salvacyon, Least he shuld dyspayre and fall into dampnacyon. [Enter Infidelitas laughing.] Infidelitas Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. A pastyme, quoth a! I knowe not the tyme nor whan I ded laugh so moch sens I was an honest man. Beleve me and ye wyll, I never sawe soch a sport. I wolde ye had bene there that ye myght have made the fort. Moseh Lex Where woldest have had me? Tell me, good brother myne. Infidelitas At the Mynorasse, ser, late yester nyght at complyne. Moseh Lex At the Mynorasse? Why, what was there ado? Infidelitas For soch an other wolde I to Southampton go. In dede yester daye it was their dedycacyon, And thydre in Gods name came I to se the fashyon. An olde fryre stode forth with spectacles on hys nose Begynnynge thys Anteme âa my fayth, I do not gloseâ [Sings.] Lapides preciosi. Moseh Lex And what ded folowe of thys? Infidelitas I shall tell ye, ser, by Gods blys. Then came Dame Isbell, an olde nonne and a calme, Crowynge lyke a capon, and thus began the Psalme: [Sings.] Saepe expugnaverunt me a iuventute mea. Moseh Lex And what includeth thys mysterye? Infidelitas A symple probleme of bytcherye. Whan the fryre begonne, afore the nonne, To synge of precyouse stones, âFrom my youth,â sayt she, âthey have confort me,ââ As it had bene for the nones. Moseh Lex I assure the playne, I set not by soch gaudes; Thy usage shewe the to be brought up amonge baudes. Infidelitas It was a good world whan we had soch wholsom storyes Preached in our churche on sondayes and other feryes. With us was it merye Whan we went to Berye, And to Our Lady of Grace, To the bloude of Hayles, Where no good chere fayles, And other holye place. Whan the prestes myght walke, And with yonge wyves talke, Than had we chyldren plentye; Than cuckoldes myght leape A score on a heape; Now is there not one to twentye. Whan the monkes were fatte And ranke as a ratte, With bellyes lyke a bore; Then all thynges were dere, Both befe, breade, and bere Now grudge the jourers sore. Whan byshoppes myght burne, And from the truth turne The syllye symple sowle, Than durst no man creake, Open mouthe nor speake Of Christ nor yet of Powle. Now are the knaves bolde With Scriptures to holde, And teache them every where, The carter, the sowter, The bodger, the clowter, That all wyll awaye, I fere. At us so they pulle, Our lyvynges are dulle, We are now lyke to fall; If we do not fyght For the churches ryght, By the messe we shall lose all. But I praye ye, ser, tell me: what is your name? Moseh Lex The lawe of Moses: to lye I were to blame. Infidelitas In these same partyes what do ye now intende? Moseh Lex Mankynde to refourme, that he hys lyfe amende. I shewe what synne is and what thynge pleaseth God; I confort the just, and the yll I ponnysh with rod. The commen people have thought it commodyouse Dyverse Goddes to have with rytes superstycyouse; My commaundement is to seke one God alone, And in all their nedes to hym make their mone. Amonge the gentyles was it thought non injurye, If a man wer hurt, to slee hys adversarye: Thys thynge I forbyd, and saye, âThu shalt not kyll: Lawe is the revenger, the man maye do no yll.â Some persones there are that inordynatlye love; Those are perswaded all thynges them to behove Whych I inhybyte, saynge contynuallye, âNo rape shalt thu do nor yet commyt advouterye; Thu shalt do no theft nor covete that is not thyne; Agaynst thy neyber shalt thu not falsely dyffyne.â Infidelitas We maye do nothynge if we be pynned in thus; Neyther yow nor God to that harde trade shall brynge us. We must have one God, and worshypp hym alone? Marry, that in dede wolde make a Turke to grone. If we be stryken, we maye not stryke agayne? A proper bargayne, and dyscretelye uttered playne! For cumpanyes sake ye saye we maye not love: I defye your worst, and to yow there is my glove! Moseh Lex What, thu wylt not fyght? Thy wyttes are better than so. Infidelitas In the quarell of love, I shall prove ye ere I go; By the messe, I thynke to put ye to your fence. Moseh Lex Thu were moch better to kepe thy pacyence. Infidelitas Naye, by cockes sowle, frynd, I must lay ye on the coate. In loves cause to fyght ye maye sone have me a floate. Naye, have at your pylche! Defende ye, if ye maye. Moseh Lex Soch a fole art thu as seke thyne owne decaye. If I ones meddle, to the it wyll be death. Dedyst thu never hear that lawe sleath in hys wreath? Infidelitas By the blessed lorde, than wyll I playe Robsons part. Moseh Lex Whye, what part wylt thu playe? Infidelitas By cockes sowle, geve over so sone as I fele smart. Moseh Lex It wyll be to late if I ones cupple with the. Infidelitas Then lete me alone, and we shall sone agre, And I shall be glad to be acquaynted with ye. Moseh Lex Acquayntaunce, good fellawe? Thu mayst sone have of me. Infidelitas The worst fault I have, I am hastye now and than; But it is sone gone, I toke it of a woman. But what meane those tables that ye have in your hande? Moseh Lex Kepe sylence a whyle and thu shalt understande. Thre thynges I declare, the first are the preceptes morall, Next the lawes judycial, and last the rytes ceremonyal. The morall preceptes are Gods commaundementes ten, Whych ought evermore to be observed of all men. The lawes of Nature the morall preceptes declare, And the plesaunt workes to God they teache and prepare. They sturre man to fayth, and provoke hym also to love, To obeye, to serve, and to worshypp God above. In two stonye tables God wrote them first of all, That they shuld remayne as thynges contynuall. The first hath but thre, whych tende to Gods hygh honour; Seven hath the seconde, and they concerne our neybour. The first doth expounde the first lawe naturall; The next the other, makynge them very formall. In sprete is the first, that we shuld God honour and love; To outward workynge the seconde doth us move, Forbyddynge all wronges, preservynge just marryage, Norryshynge true peace and other godly usage. Infidelitas What is the effect of your lawes judycyall? Moseh Lex Soch thynges to commaunde as are cyvyle or temporall. From vyce to refrayne and outwarde injurye, Quyet to conserve and publyque honestie: These are to support the lawes of the seconde table. Ceremonyall rytes are also commendable, In holy dayes, garmentes, temples and consecracyons, Sacryfyces and vowes, with offerynges and expiacyons, Whych are unto Christ as fygurs, types and shadowes. As Paule doth declare, in hys pystle to the Hebrues, These are only fygures and outwarde testymonyes, No Man is perfyght by soch darke ceremonyes: Only perteyne they unto the thirde commaundement Of the Sabboth daye, tyll Christ the lorde be present, In hys death endyng the whole Judaycal presthode. Infidelitas Good dayes myght ye have, ye speake it full wele by the rode. A am a poore lad, and by my trouth bent ernestlye To wayte upon ye and to be your very lackye. Moseh Lex What art thu called, I praye the hartelye? Infidelitas Graye fryre am I non âby the messe I can not flatter. I am Infydelyte, to tell the truth of the matter. Moseh Lex And hast thu so longe dyssembled thus with me? Infidelitas Yea, for advauntage, to smell out your subtylyte. Moseh Lex Avoyde hens I saye, thu false Infydelyte. Infidelitas Naye, that I wyll not, by Yngham Trynyte. Moseh Lex Wylt thu not in dede? Than wyll I fet hyther the poure Of judges and kynges to subdue the within thys houre. Exit. Infidelitas Soch knyghtes wyll I have as shall confounde them all, As Sadducees and Scrybes with the sect pharysaycal. By helpe of my chyldren Idolatry and Sodomye The lawe of Nature I kest ones in a leprye. I have yet two more, Ambycyon and Covetousnes, Whych wyll do as moch to the lawe of Moses. Where are my whoresons that they come not awaye? [Enter Avaritia and Ambitio.] Avaritia Yea, whoreson, on thy face, even in thy best araye! [as] Jurisconsultus I wyll thu knowe it, I am a worshypfull doctour, A Scrybe in the lawe, and a profytable proctour. Infidelitas Goppe with a vengeaunce! How comest thu so aloft? Avaritia I shall tell the, man, if thu wylt commen more soft, By fayned flatterye and by coloured adulacyon; Ambycyon here also rose out of a lyke foundacyon. Infidelitas Come, axe me blessynge, lyke praty boyes apace. Ambitio I wyll not bowe sure to soch a folysh face. Infidelitas Axe blessynge, I saye, and make me no more ado. Ambitio Unsemelye were it we prelates shuld do so. Avaritia For no compulsyon wyll I do it, by swete Marye. Infidelitas I must fatche ye in, there is no remedye. A, noughty whoresons, have I brought ye up hytherto? And knowe not your father? Ye shal drynke both ere I go! [Infidelitas beats them.] Ambo simul. Nomore at thys tyme! Forsoth we crye a mercye. Infidelitas Downe on your knees than, and axe me blessyng shortely. Ambo simul. Blesse me, gentyll father, for swete saynt charyte. Infidelitas Aryse noughty knaves; God lete ye never to thee! Though amonge our selves, we murmour, bragge, and face, Somtyme for lucre, somtyme for the hyghar place, Yet for advauntage, in thys we all agre, To blynde the rulers, and deceyve the commynalte. Avaritia Art advysed of that? By the messe we are in dede; Yet of our knaveryes, the foles wyll never take hede. To labour with a spade Our colour wolde it fade; We maye not with that trade, We love so moch our ease. We must lyve by their sweate, And have good drynke and meate, Whan they have not to eate The substaunce of a pease. We leade them in the darke, And so their conscyence marke, That sturdy they are and starke, In every wycked evyll. We teache ydolatrye, And laugh full merelye To se ych cumpanye Ronne headlondes to the devyll. If we maye have the tythynges, And profytable offerynges, We care not to what doynges They customablye fall. We are soch mercenaryes, And subtyle propryetaryes As from the flock all carryes The wolle, skynne, flesh and all. In our perambulacyons We loke for commendacyons And lowlye salutacyons In temple, howse, and strete. Our lowsye Latyne howres, In borowes and in bowres, The poore people devowres, And treade them undre fete. Ambitio I am Ambycyon, Whose dysposycyon Is honour to appete. I gape for empyre, And worshypp desyre, As Minos ded in Crete. I loke up aloft, And love to lye soft, Not carynge for my flocke. Have I ones the flese, With pygges, lambes and gese, They maye go turne a socke. Lucifer I made So hyghly to wade, To God he wolde be equall. Of Adam and Eve I slewe the beleve, And caused them to fall. What nede I rehearce The gyauntes most fearce, With the buylders of Babell? Nemrod the tyraunt With them there applyaunt Agreed to my counsell. From me wolde not go Cruell Pharao No more wolde Amalech, Saul, Achitophel, Absolon, Jesabel, Nor Adonisedech. I made Roboam And Hieroboam, With Nabuchodonosor, Triphon, Alchimus, And Simon Magus, To abuse them evermor. In pryde I excede, And no people fede, But with lyes for advauntage. As Mantuane tell, To leade men to hell Is my most commen usage. Hygh thynges I attempt, And wyll me exempt From prynces jurysdyccyon. I am soch an evyll As brynge to the devyll Without anye contradyccyon. Infidelitas Here is a prelate even for myne owne touth; Soch an other is not in the whole south. Clappe thu somwhat more as thu hast begunne; I lyke wele your talkynge, by the holy nunne! Avaritia I Covetyse am, The devyll or hys dam, For I am insacyate. I ravysh and plucke, I drawe and I sucke, After a wolvysh rate. Father nor mother, Syster nor brother, I spare not in my moode. I feare neyther God, Nor hys ryghtfull rod, In gatherynge of goode. Both howse and medowe From the poor wydowe I spare not for to take; Ryght heyres I rob, And as bare as Job The fatherles I make. With me toke Nadab, Nabal and Achab, With all the clergye of Bell; Judas and Giezi, With the sonnes of Heli, And the sonnes of Samuel. Jannes and Jambres, Also Diotrephes Wrought wylfull wyckednesse; So ded Menelaus, With false Andronicus, And all for covetousnesse. Ambitio With vyces seven I close up heaven, And speare up paradyce; I oppen hell By my counsell, Maynteynynge every vyce. Avaritia For sylver and golde With falsehed I holde, Supportynge every evyl. I have it in awe For to choke the lawe, And brynge all to the devyll. Infidelitas By the blessed trynyte, No men more fyt for me To do my busynes; Ambycyon to begyle, And Avaryce to defyle The lawe of Moyses. Tell me first of all what wylt thu do Ambycyon? Ambitio I am thyne owne chylde, thu knowest my dysposycyon; I wyll sure do as ded the Phylystynes. Infidelitas Why, what ded those knaves? Ambitio They stopped up Abrahams pyttes, as Genesis diffines, With mudde and with myre, and left them full uncleane. Infidelitas By that same practyse tell me what thu dost meane. Ambitio With fylthy gloses and dyrty exposycyons Of Gods lawe wyll I hyde the pure dysposycyons. The keye of knowledge I wyll also take awaye By wrastynge the text to the scriptures sore decaye. Infidelitas And what wylt thu do, my fellawe Covetousnes? Avaritia A vayle wyll I sprede upon the face of Moses, That non shal perceyve the clerenes of hys contenaunce, Whych is of the lawe the meanyng and true ordynaunce. Infidelitas Why, what wyll ye saye unto the ten commaundementes? Ambitio We must poyson them with wyll workes and good intentes. Where as God doth saye, âNo straunge goddes thu shalt have,â With sayntes worshyppynge that clause we wyll deprave. And though he commaunde to make no carved ymage, For a good intent yet wyll we have pylgrymage. Though he wyll us not to take hys name in vayne, With tradycyons yet therunto wyll we constrayne. No Sabboth wyl we with Gods worde sanctyfye, But with lyppe labour and ydle ceremonye. To father and mother we maye owe non obedyence, Our relygyon is of so great excellence. Though we do not slee, yet maye we heretykes burne If they wyll not sone from holy scripture turne. What though it be sayd, âThu shalt do no fornycacyon,â Yet wyll we mayntene moch greatter abhomynacyon. Though theft be forbyd, yet wyll we contynuallye Robbe the poore people through prayer and purgatorye. God hath inhybyted to geve false testymonye, Yet we wyll condempne the Gospell for heresye. We shuld not covete our neybers howse nor wyfe, Hys servaunt nor beast, yet are we therin most ryfe. Of men make we swyne by the draffe of our tradycyons, And cause them nothynge to regard but superstycyons. As dogges unresonable on most vyle carren fede, So wyll we cause them seke ydolles in their nede; And alwayes their grounde shall be for a good intent. Infidelitas More myscheves I trowe the devyll coulde not invent Than yow two can do; by the messe, ye are alone! Lyttle coulde I do, were ye ones from me gone To the corruptynge of the lawe of Moyses; Go forwarde therfor in your deceytfulnes. Avaritia With superstycyons the Jewes ceremonyall lawes I wyll so handle they shall not be worth two strawes. The lawes judycyall through cawtels and delayes I wyll also drowne to all ryghteouse mennys decayes. To set thys forwarde we must have sophystrye, Phylosophye and logyck, as scyence necessarye. The byshoppes must holde their prestes in ignoraunce With longe Latyne houres, least knowledge to them chaunce; Lete them have longe mattens, longe evensonges and longe masses; And that wyll make them as dull as ever were asses; That they shall never be able to prophecye, Or yet preach the truth to our great injurye. Lete the cloysterers be brought up ever in sylence, Without the scriptures in payne of dysobedyence. Se the laye people praye never but in Latyne; Lete them have their crede and servyce all in Latyne That a Latyne beleve maye make a Latyne sowle: Lete them nothynge knowe of Christ nor yet of Powle. If they have Englysh lete it be for advauntage For pardons, for dyrges, for offerynges and pylgrymage. I recken to make them a newe crede in a whyle, And all in Englysh, their conscyence to begyle. Infidelitas Rehearce unto me the artycles of that crede. Avaritia The artycles are these, geve eare and take good hede: First they shall beleve in our holy father Pope; Next in hys decrees and holy decretals; Then in holy church, with sencer, crosse and cope, In the ceremonyes and blessed sacramentals; In purgatory then, in pardons and in trentals, In praynge to sayntes, and in Saynt Frances whoode, In Our Lady of Grace, and in the blessed roode. They shall beleve also in rellyckes and relygyon, In Our Ladyes psalter, in fre wyll and good wurkes, In the ember dayes, and in the Popes remyssyon, In bedes and in belles not used of the Turkes, In the golden masses agaynst soch spretes as lurkes With charmes and blessynges. Thys crede wyll brynge in moneye; In Englysh therfor we wyl it clarkely conveye. Infidelitas Yea, and burne the knaves that wyll not beleve that crede, That into the dytche the blynde the blynde maye lede. Ambitio Then I holde it best that we alwayes condempne The Byble readers least they our actes contempne. Infidelitas Yea, never spare them, but evermore playe the bytar, Expressynge alwayes the tropes and types of thy mytar. Ambitio Why, what dost thu thynke my mytar to sygnyfy? Infidelitas The mouth of a wolfe, and that shall I prove by and byâ If thu stoupe downewarde, loo, se how the wolfe doth gape. Redye to devoure the lambes, least any escape. But thy wolvyshnesse by thre crownes wyll I hyde, Makynge the a Pope, and a captayne of all pryde, That whan thu doest slee soch as thy lawes contempne Thu mayst saye, âNot I, but the powers ded them condempne.â These labels betoken the lawes of se non and can non. Ambitio I trowe thu woldest saye the two lawes cyvyle and canon. Infidelitas As I spake, I thought, and styll thynke, by Saynt Johan. Yea, persecute styll the instructers of the people, And thu, Covetousnesse, lete no bell rynge in steple Without a profyght. Tush, take moneye every whear, So nygh clyppe and shave that thu leave never a heare. Avaritia I caused the Pope to take but now of late Of the graye fryres to have canonyzate Franciscus de Pola thre thousand duckates and more; And as moch besydes he had not longe afore For a cardynall hatte of the same holy orderâ Thus drawe we to us great goodes from every border. Pope Clement the Seventh payed ones for hys papacye Thre hondred thousand good duckates of lawful monye. Infidelitas I marvele how he coulde come to so moch good. Avaritia Yes, yes, by pollage, and by shedynge Christen blood. Crosers and mytars in Rome are good merchandyce, And all to lyttle to maynteyne their pompe and vyce. Ambitio The Pope for whoredom hath in Rome and Viterbye Of golde and sylver a wonderfull substaunce yearlye. Tush, they be in Englande that moch rather wolde to dwell Whores in their dyoceses than the readers of Christes Gospell. Infidelitas They do the better for by them they maye have profyght; As for the other, do trouble them daye and nyght. Well now steppe forewarde and go do your busynes To the corruptynge of the lawe of Moyses. Avaritia Doubt not but we shall make hym a crepple blynde. Infidelitas Synge then at our farwel to recreate our mynde. Finita cantiuncula exeunt ambo. Infidelitas Now am I left alone, And these two merchauntes gone, Their myschefes to conclude, I thynke within a whyle They wyll trappe and begyle The worthy lawe of Jude. Ambycyon first of all With hys rytes bestiall Wyll make the people swyne. In draffe wyll he them lede, And with tradycyons fede Where they shall suppe or dyne. Covetousnes wyll warke That many one shall barke Lyke dogges agaynst the truth. Some shall Gods worde defyle And some wyll it revyle, Soch beastlynesse ensuth. Ambycyon hath thys houre All the whole spirytuall poure And maye do what hym lust. Now Covetousnesse doth rule, And hath both horse and mule, All matters by hym dyscust. Now byshopryckes are solde And the Holy Ghost for gold The Pope doth bye and sell. The truth maye not be tolde Undre paynes manyfolde With sendynges downe to hell. The people prestes do famysh And their goodes from them ravysh, Yea, and all the worlde they blynde. All prynces do they mock, And robbe the syllye flocke, Nothynge they leave behynde. On the face of Moyses A vayle they have cast doughtles, The lyght of the lawe to hyde, Least men to Christ shuld comme From ceremonyes domme As to their heavenly gyde. The lawe can never be At anye lyberte Where soch two enemyes raigne. Now is it tyme to walke; Of thys more wyll I talke Whan I come hyther agayne. Exit. [Enter Moseh Lex blind and lame.] Moseh Lex If pytie maye move your gentyll christen hartes Lete it now sturre ye to mourne thys heavye chaunce. Two enemyes with me have played most wycked partes And left me starke blynde, God knoweth to my sore grevaunce, And I thynke also to your more hynderaunce. To leade yow to Christ somtyme a gyde I was; Now am I so blynde I can not do it, alas! Most rygorouslye those enemyes now of late Ded fall upon me and spoyle me of my syght. One was Ambycyon whych ever ought me hate, And Covetousnesse the other enemye hyght. Now for soth and God, in their most cruell spyght The one made me blynde, the other made me lame. And whan they had done, ther at they had great game. Thus a blynde crypple I wander here alone, Abydynge the tyme and grace of restauracyon By the Sonne of God, to whom I make my mone, My cause to pytie and graunt me supportacyon; Least I be left here to utter desolacyon And extreme decaye, without any remedye, If he ded not helpe, of goodnesse and of mercye. Ye christen prynces, God hath geven yow the poure With scepture and swerde all vyces to correct. Let not Ambycyon nor Covetousnesse devoure Your faythfull subjectes, nor your offycers infect. Have to your clergye a dylygent respect, And se they do not corrupt the lawes of God, For that doth requyre a terryble heavye rod. God gave me to man, and left me in tables of stone, That I of hardenesse a lawe shuld specyfye; But the Pharysees corrupted me anone And toke from me cleane the quyvernesse of bodye With clerenesse of syght and other pleasures manye. Now wyll I to Christ, that he maye me restore To more perfeccyon than ever I had afore. [Exit.] Finit Actus tertius. Incipit Actus Quartus [Enter Evangelium.] Evangelium Unfaythfulnesse hath corrupted every lawe To the gret decaye of Adams posteryte; Were it nott for me, whych now do hyther drawe, All flesh wolde perysh, no man shuld saved be. I am Christes Gospell, and infallyble veryte; Soch a power of God as saveth all that beleve, No burdene nor yoke that any man wyll greve. In the bloude of Christ I am a full forgevenesse, Where fayth is grounded with a sure confydence. I am soch a grace, and so hygh tydynges of gladnesse As rayse the synner and pacyfye hys conscyence. I am sprete and lyfe; I am necessarye scyence. I requyre but love for mannys justyfycatyon, With a fayth in Christ for hys helth and salvacyon. [Enter Infidelitas.] Infidelitas Gods beneson have ye! It is joye of your lyfe. I have hearde of ye, and of my mastres your wyfe. Evangelium If thu heardest of me, it was by the voyce of God. Infidelitas Naye, he that spake of ye was sellynge of a cod In an oyster bote, a lyttle beyonde Quene Hythe; A northen man was he, and besought ye to be blythe. Evangelium If he spake of me he was some godly preacher. Infidelitas Naye ser, by the roode, nor yet a wholsom teacher. Evangelium After what maner ded he speake of me?âtell. Infidelitas He swore lyke a man, by all contententes of the Gospell; He swore and better swore, yea, he ded sweare and sweare agayne. Evangelium That speakynge is soch as procureth eternall payne. Wyll not the people leave that most wycked folye, And it so dampnable? To heare it I am sorye. But what dedyst thu meane whan thu spakest of my wyfe? Infidelitas Nothynge; but I thought it was joye of your lyfe That ye were so good to your neybers as ye are. Evangelium Why, how good am I? Thy fantasye declare. Infidelitas Ye ease them amonge, if it be as I heare; Whan ye are abroade there is fyne myry cheare. Evangelium As thu art, thu speakest, after thy hartes abundaunce, For as the man is, soch is hys utteraunce. My wyfe is the church, or christen congregacyon, Regenerate in sprete, doynge no vyle operacyon; Both cleane and holy, without eyther spott or wryncle The lambe with hys bloude ded her wash and bespryncle. Thys is not the church of dysgysed hypocrytes, Of apysh shavelynges, or papystycall sodomytes; Nor yet, as they call it, a temple of lyme and stone, But a lyvysh buyldynge, grounded in fayth alone, On the harde rocke Christ whych is the sure foundacyon: And of thys church some do reigne in every nacyon, And in all contrayes though their nombre be but small. Infidelitas Their nomber is soch as hath ronne over all; The same Danes are they men prophecy of playne, Whych shuld over ronne thys realme yet ones agayne. Evangelium What Danes speakest thu of? Thy meanynge shewe more clerlye. Infidelitas Dane Johan, Dane Robert, Dane Thomas, and Dane Harrye; These same are those Danes that laye with other mennys wyves, And occupyed their landes to the detryment of their lyves. These are accounted a great part of the churche, For in Gods servyce they honourablye wurche, Yellynge and cryenge tyll their throtes are full sore. Evangelium That church was descrybed of Esaye longe afore: âThys people,â sayth God, âwith ther lyppes honour me,â In vayne worshyp they, teachynge mennys fatuyte. Apparaunt is that church and open to the eyes; Their worshyppynges are in outwarde ceremonyes. That counterfet church standeth al by mennys tradycyons, Without the scriptures and without the hartes affeccyons. My church is secrete and evermore wyll be, Adorynge the Father in sprete and in veryte. By the worde of God thys church is ruled onlye, And doth not consyst in outwarde ceremonye. Thys congregacyon is the true church mylytaunt; Those counterfet desardes are the very church malygnaunt, To whom Christ wyll saye, âI knowe non of your sort.â Infidelitas Moch are they to blame that ther bretherne so report. Evangelium Soch are no bretherne, but enemyes to Christes blode, As put salvacyon in shaven crowne, mytar or whode. Infidelitas I praye ye, how longe have your swete spowse contynued? Evangelium Sens the begynnynge, and now is in Christ renued: Adam had promyse of Christes incarnacyon, So had Abraham with hys whole generacyon Whych was unto them a preachynge of the Gospell Into salvacyon and delyveraunce from hell. Infidelitas By thys tyme I hope ye have a fayre increase? Evangelium She is not barren, but beareth, and never cease. The Corinthes first epystle hath thys clere testymony: âIn Christo Jesu per Evangelium vos genuiâ I have begote yow in Jesu Christ,â sayth Powle, âBy the Gospel preachynge to the confort of your sowle.â Infidelitas Than are ye a cuckolde, by the blessed holy masse! As I sayd afore, so cometh it now to passe, For I am a prophete by hygh inspiracyon led. Now lyke I my self moch better than I ded. Ye sayt that Saynt Paule begate your wyfe with chylde! Evangelium By mysunderstandynge thu art ungracyously begylde. An only mynyster was Paule in that same doynge; That he therin ded was by the Gospell preachynge. Hys mynde is the Gospell to have done that operacyon, And thys must thu holde for no carnall generacyon. Infidelitas Marry, so they saye, ye fellawes of the newe lernynge Forsake holy church, and now fall fast to wyvynge. Evangelium Naye, they forsake whoredome with other dampnable usage, And lyve with their wyves in lawfull marryage Whyls the Popes oyled swarme raigne styll in their olde buggerage. Infidelitas Yea, poore marryed men have very moch a do; I counte hym wysest that can take a snatche and to go. Evangelium Thu semest one of them that detesteth matrymonye, Whych is afore God a state both just and holye. Of soch as thu art Saynt Paule ded prophecye, By the Holy Ghost that a serten cumpanye In the latter dayes from the truth of God shuld fall, Attendynge to spretes of errour dyabolycall: Whych in hypocresy wyll teache lyes for advauntage With marked conscyences inhybytynge marryage. Thu aperest by thy frutes to be Infydelyte. Infidelitas I am non other but even the very he, And hyther now come I to commen the matter with ye. Evangelium Avoyde, cursed fynde, and get the out at the gates! Infidelitas Naye, first wyll I serve ye as I lately served your mates; And hens wyll I not, for thys place is for me. Who shuld here remayne but Infydelyte? Evangelium Well than for a tyme I must depart from hens. But thys first wyll I saye before thys audyens: Easyer wyll it be concernynge ponnyshment To Sodom and Gomor in the daye of judgement, Than to those cyties that resyst the veryte At the suggestyons of Infydelyte. That people wyll be for ever and ever lost, For it is the great synne agaynst the Holy Ghost. In the olde lawe first the Father hys mynde exprest; Than came hys sonne Christ and made it more manyfest; And now the Holy Ghost is come to close up allâ If he be not heard, extreme dampnacyon wyll fall. No prayer remayneth, nor expyacyon for synne To them that no profyght of the worde of God wyll wynne. Take good hede therfor, and saye that ye have warnyng. Exit. Infidelitas God sende your mother of yow to have a fondelynge! By the masse, I thynke he is wele out of the waye. Now wyll I contryve the dryft of another playe. I must worke soch wayes Christes lawe maye not contynue. In a whyle am I lyke to have non els of my retynue. Companyons I want to begynne thys tragedye; Namely False Doctryne, and hys brother Hypocresye. They wyll not be longe, I suppose now verelyeâ By cockes sowle, me thynke I se soch a cumpanye. Hem, I saye! Chyldren, wyll not my voyce be hearde? As good is a becke as is a dewe vow garde. By my honestie, welcome, myne owne companyons both! Intrant [Pseudodoctrina and Hypocrisis.] Pseudodoctrina Thu shalt sure have a lyvery of the same cloth ... Gramercyes, by God, my olde frynde Infydelyte! Hypocrisis What, brother Snyp Snap, how go the wor[l]de with the? Infidelitas What, fryre Flyp Flap, how saye ye to Benedicite? Hypocrisis Marry, nothynge but well, for I crye now advauntage. Infidelitas At her purse or arse? Tell me, good fryre Succage. Hypocrisis By the messe, at both, for I am a great penytensar, And syt at the pardon. Tush, I am the Popes owne vycar; If thu lackest a pece, I knowe where thu mayst be sped With c[h]oyse of a score, and brought even to thy bed. Pseudodoctrina Art thu not ashamed to talke so lyke a knave? Hypocrisis No, for it is soch gere as the holyest of us wyll have; Pope, cardynall, byshop, monke, chanon, prest, and fryre, Not one of ye all but a woman wyll desyre. Pseudodoctrina Our orders permyt us not to have them in marryage. Hypocrisis No, but ye fatche them in by an other carryage: Ye do even as we do; we both are of one rate. Infidelitas By the messe, I laugh to heare thys whoreson prate. Pseudodoctrina What fashyon use ye? âto us here intymate. Hypocrisis Ego distinguo whether ye wyll have Lyons or Parys. Pseudodoctrina Of them both to shewe, it wyll not be farre amys. Hypocrisis In Parys we have the mantell of Saynt Lewes Whych women seke moch for helpe of their barennes; For be it ones layed upon a womannys bellye, She go thens with chylde, the myracles are seane there daylye. And besydes all thys, ye wolde marvele in confessyon What our fathers do to assoyle them of transgressyon. Johan Thessecclius assoyled a yonge woman ones Behynde the hygh aulter tyll she cryed out of her bones. And as for Lyons, there is the length of our Lorde In a great pyller. She that wyll with a coorde Be fast bounde to it and take soch chaunce as fall Shall sure have chylde, for within it is hollowe all. Tush, I coulde tell ye of moch more wondre than this; In course to heare them I thynke ye wolde ye blys. Pseudodoctrina As thu hast begunne, go forewarde in it and tell. Infidelitas Soch a knave, I suppose, is not from hens to hell. Hypocrisis In our relygyon was an holye popysh patryarke Whych of all bawdrye myght be the great monarke; The nonnes to confesse he went from place to place, And two hondred of them he broached in that space. Many spyces he eate hys currage to provoke; Soch a fellawe was he as of that gere had the stroke. Pseudodoctrina Now somwhat wyll I tell to confirme thy tale withall. In Kynge Ferdynands tyme in Spayne was a cardynall, Petrus Mendoza was the very man that I meane. Of lemans he had great nombre besydes the quene. One of hys bastardes was earle, an other was duke, Whom also he abused and thought it no rebuke. Joannes Cremona, an other good cardynall, For reformacyon of the clergye spyrituall Came ones into Englande to dampne prestes matrymonye, And the next nyght after was taken doynge bytcherye. Doctor Eckius also whych fearcely came to dyspute In Lipsia with Luther, myndynge there hym to confute For marryage of prestys, thre chyldren had that yeare. By thys maye ye se that sumtyme we make mery cheare. Infidelitas Marry, that ye do; I shall beare ye recorde now: But how wyll ye answere for breakynge of your vow? Pseudodoctrina We never breake vowe so longe as we do not marrye, Though we in whoredome be never so bolde and busye. Infidelitas By your order than ye maye walke moch at large. What hast thu, Hypocresye to laye for thy dyscharge? Hypocrisis Saynt Frances habyte with the holy gyrdle and whode; Non can go to helle that therin dye, by the rode; In case Saynt Frances be sure upon their syde, Els maye they fortune to be of their purpose wyde. For I reade of one that shuld have gone to the devyll But the spretes of helle coulde do to hym non evyll Tyll Saynt Frances came and toke from hym hys cowle; Then went he to helle, the fryres ded heare hym howle. I wyll therfor serve Saynt Frances with hart and mynde, With dayly memoryes that he maye be my frynde; And than I care not for all the devyls in hellâ That I have tolde yow is more true than the Gospel. Infidelitas Then are ye more sure than monkes for your heretage, For their landes are here but ye clayme heaven for advauntage. Pseudodoctrina Yet is it to them a very plesaunt thynge Their abbot at home to be called lorde and kynge. Infidelitas Naye, monke and chorle, for here is no kynge but one; If he be a kynge hys mace is a marybone And hys crowne a cow torde. Soch knaves as come from the cart Must be called kynges for playenge a popysh part. Pseudodoctrina It become not the the Romysh Pope so to lurche Consyderynge he is the hyghest of the churche. Infidelitas If he be the hyghest, than is he the wether cocke. Pseudodoctrina Ah, now I perceyve thu art dysposed to mocke; Of all holy churche he is the pryncypall heade. Infidelitas Marry, that is true; he sendeth out bulles undre lead And he hath two keyes, the one to open hell, The other speareth heaven âthus do newe heretykes tel. They report also that dogges have no devocyon To hys holy lawes, nor to hys olde instruccyon. Pseudodoctrina Why shuld dogges hate hym? Make that more evydent. Infidelitas They love no pese porrege, nor yet reade hearynges in Lent, Stock fysh nor oysters, but curse hym body and bone, And wolde hys reade sprottes and rotten fysh were gone. Tush, I heare them, I, and that maketh me full sad. Hypocrisis Eyther thu doest mock, or els thu art sure mad. Infidelitas I heare the people complayne very moch of the. Pseudodoctrina What is their pratlinge? I praye the hartely, tell me. Infidelitas They saye thus teachest nothyng but lowsy tradycions. And lyes for lucre, with damnable superstycyons. And thus they conclude that the draffe of popysh prystes Is good ynough for swyne, by whom they meane the papystes. Yea, and they saye also, the dyet of men is all To most vyle carren, the dogges wyll sonest fall. Pseudodoctrina Than do they compare the papystes unto dogges. Infidelitas Marry, that they do, and to soch swynysh hogges As in swyll and sosse are brought up all their lyfe. Soch are the papystes they saye both man and wyfe. They saye of the also that thu art a noughty knave; By prowlynge and lyenge ye fryers wolde all have. Thyne order they saye is spronge even out of hell, And all thys knowledge they have now of the Gospell. Hypocrisis Why, where is he now? I besych the hartely tell. Infidelitas By the messe, abroade, and I warande ye maketh revell. I commoned with hym, and he ded us despyse; Agaynst hym therfor sumwhat must we devyse. Pseudodoctrina Marry that must we, or els it wyll be wronge; He wyll sure destroye us if we do suffer hym longe. Nedes must we serve hym as we ones served Christ. Infidelitas Why, mad brayned whoresons, how ded ye handle Christ? Pseudodoctrina As he preached here, we followed from place to place To trappe hym in snare, and hys doctryne to deface. Than founde we the meanes to put hym so to death Least he agaynst us shuld open any more breath; And we set foure knyghtes to kepe hym downe in hys grave That he never more our lyvynge shuld deprave. And thus must we serve the Gospell, no remedye, Els wyll he destroye our lyvynge perpetuallye. Better one were lost than we shuld perysh all, As Cayphas ones sayd in counsell pharysaycall. Infidelitas By God, and wele sayd! Whan ye have hym in hys grave Stampe hym downe tyll he shyte, and serve hym lyke a knave. Hypocrisis We must so ordre hym that he go nomore at large. Pseudodoctrina Foure knyghtes wyll we hyre whom we shall streyghtly charge To kepe hym downe harde. The first are ambycyouse prelates, Then covetouse lawers that Gods worde spyghtfully hates, Lordes without lernynge, and justyces unryghtfull: These wyll kepe hym downe, and rappe hym on the scull. Ther someners and ther scribes I warande ye shal stere With balyves and catchpolles to holde hym downe every where. I trowe Rugge and Corbet at Norwych wyll do their part, With Wharton of Bongaye, and for my sake put hym to smart. Hypocrisis And I wyll rayse up in the unyversytees The seven slepers there to advaunce the Popes decrees: As Dorbel and Duns, Durande and Thomas of Aquyne, The mastre of sentens, with Bachon the great devyne, Henricus de Gandavo and these shall read ad clerum, Aristotle and Albert, de secretis mulierum, With the commentaryes of Avicen and Averoyes, And a Phebo Phebe whych is very good for boyes. Infidelitas Yea, and lete the Pope, as Gods owne vycar here, In hys hande thre crosses and thre crownes on hys head bere, Hys power betokenynge in heaven, in earth, and in hell, That he maye commaunde all kynges to subdue the Gospell. Pseudodoctrina Hysselfe maye do that, he nede commaunde non other. Is not he the head of the holy church, our mother? Maye not he make sayntes and devyls at hys owne pleasure, Whych hath in hys handes the keyes and churches treasure, So wele as he made Saynt Herman first a saynt, And twenty years after of heresye hym attaynt? First he sent hym to heaven by hys canonyzacyon, And from thens to helle by an excommunycacyon. We reade of Formosus that after he was dead One Pope hys fyngars, an other cut of hys head, And threwe hys carkas into the floude of Tyber, With the head and fyngars, as Platina doth remember. In token that he is judge over quyck and dead, And maye dampne and save by hys pardons undre lead, Sylvester the Seconde to the devyll hymself ones gave For that hygh offyce that he myght dampne and save. He offered also hys stones to Sathan they saye For prestes chastyte, and so went their marryage awaye. [Enter Evangelium.] Hypocrisis Here is one commynge, enquyre what he intende. Infidelitas Ha, it is the Gospell! From hym God us defende! Exit secreto. Pseudodoctrina Shewe me, brother myne, who ded the hyther sende. Evangelium The Father of Heaven of hys mere benyvolence.

Evangelium In the lawes of God wolde I instruct them gladlye; For non other waye there is unto salvacyon, But the worde of God in every generacyon, That quyckeneth, that saveth, that bryngeth unto heaven, As before hys death Christ taught the Apostle aleven. Pseudodoctrina Preache here thu shalt not without the auctoryte Of pope or byshopp, or of some of their affynyte. Evangelium Gods worde never taketh hys autoryte of man. Pseudodoctrina Thu shalt not here preache, do thu the best thu can. Hypocrisis Gods blessynge on your good hart, it is spoken even like a man. Ye knowe thys daye, ser, we have a full holy feast, And must go processyon with the blessed Rode of Reast. We have longe mattens, longe laudes, longe houres, longe pryme; Masse, evensonge, complyne and all must be done in tyme; Sensynge of the aulters, and castynge of holy water, Holy breade makynge with other necessary matter. Evangelium Have God commaunded any soch thynges to be done? Pseudodoctrina What is that to the? Go meddle thu with olde shone. Cannyst thu saye but they are good sygnyfycacyons? Evangelium I saye they are frutes of your ymagynacyons To brynge in lucre and darken Gods hygh glorye. Of yow God doth axe no soch vayne beggerye; Christ never sent hys to shewe sygnyfycacyons, But hys lyvynge worde to all the christen nacyons. Ye forsake the Lorde, as Esaias doth tell, And hyghly blaspheme the holie of Israel. In hys first chaptre thys horryble sentence is: Quis haec frustranea quaesivit de manibus vestris; Who hath requyred of yow soch sacryfyce? In vayne offer yow that uncommaunded servyce. Your incense to me is great abhomynacyon; I sore abhorre it and moch detest your fashyon. Whan ye praye to me I geve ye non attendaunce, But avert my face, sayth God, and my countenaunce. By thys ye maye se that the Lorde doth not regarde Your mangy mutterynge, neyther graunt it any rewarde. No man wylleth Paule to speake in the congregacyon In a straunge language without interpretacyon. In your Latyne houres the flocke do ye not consydre But declare your selves to be Romysh all togydre. âBe not led about,â sayth Paule, âby any straunge lernynge.â What els is your doctryne but a blynde popysh thynge?

Pseudodoctrina Get the hens shortly, or with the it wyll be wronge. Intrat [Infidelitas.] Infidelitas Peace be here, and God, mastre doctour, by your leave, That I maye declare a pardone here in my sleve, Of Our Lady of Boston, Ingham, and Saynt Johannes frarye, With the indulgence of blessyd Saynt Antonye.

Infidelitas Good christen people, I am come hyther verelye As a true p[r]octour of the howse of Saynt Antonye.

By the auctoryte of Pope Leo and Pope Clement, Pope Bonyface, Pope Pius, Pope Johan, and Pope Innocent. And here I blesse ye with a wynge of the Holy Ghost, From thonder to save ye, and from spretes in every coost. Lo, here is a belle to hange upon your hogge, And save your cattell from the bytynge of a dogge. So many as wyll come to thys holy fraternyte, Come paye your moneye, and ye shall have letters of me. Pseudodoctrina Lete me have a letter, for I wyll be a brother. Hypocrisis Then geve me a belle, for I wyll be an other. Evangelium O dampnable leadynge of Babylonicall Sodomytes! Your selves ye declare to be shamefull hypocrytes. Lorde, pytie thy people, and take awaye these gydes, These scorners, these robbers, these cruell homycydes. Soch prophetes are they as God ded never sende; As Hieremy sayth, they dampnable wayes pretende. Wo, hypocrytes, wo! For here ye tryfle and mocke With christen people, and the kyngedom of heaven uplocke. Ye count it a game to lose that Christ hath bought With hys precyouse bloud, and here most derely sought. O ye are wretches and pestylent Antichristes, Mynysters of Dagon, and most deceytfull papystes. Lyke ravenouse wolves, poore wydowes ye devoure; By tyttle of prayer eternall dampnacyon is youre. Your owne dreames ye folowe, but matter moch more wayghtye Ye do not esteme, as judgement, faythe, and mercye. Wo, Pharysees, wo! Ye make cleane outwardlye, But inwardes ye are full of covetousnesse and baudrye. Paynted tumbes are ye, [aperynge] ryght bewtyfull; But within ye stynke, and have thoughtes very shamefull. Ye slewe the prophetes, your doynges yet beare wytnesse: How thynke ye to avoyde that poynt of unryghteousnesse? Oh ragynge serpentes, and vyperouse generacyon, How can ye escape the daunger of dampnacyon? Pseudodoctrina Who made the so bolde to medle within my cure, And teache newe lernynge? An heretyke art thu sure. If due serch were made, we shuld fynde the, I thynke, no pryst. Evangelium Yes, anoynted of God, but no popysh Antichrist. Pseudodoctrina Lete me se, where are the letters of thy orders? Evangelium Where Christ hys self is, and not in these same borders. No soch pryst am I as is anoynted with oyle, But the Holy Gost, for I am non of thys soyle. Pseudodoctrina Here I attache the for a busye scysmatyke, And wyll the accuse for an haynouse heretyke. Laye handes upon hym, and depryve hym of thys aparell. Hic veste spoliatum sordidioribus induunt. Loo, thus wyll I handle all them that shall take thy quarell.

Evangelium I wyll neyther abjure, nor yet recant Gods glorye. Pseudodoctrina I offered the reason, and therto thu wylt not applye. Wele, get the forewarde, for thu shalt sure dye. The temporall power shall judge the to the fyre At our accusement and holy relygyouse desyre. Evangelium Though yow for my sake impryson men cruellye, Famysh them, stocke them, and them with fagotes frye, Hurt me ye shall not, for I can never dye, And they for my sake shall lyve perpetuallye.

Infidelitas Yea, burne hym wele, fryre, and lete hym no longer raygne. Laye on grene fagotes to put hym to the more payne. By the messe, I laugh to se how thys gere doth wurke. He is lyke of them to have nomore grace than a Turke, For soch knaves they are as a man shall not lyghtly fynde, And rake hell over âcompanyons they are to my mynde. My busynesse all is now at a good conclusyon, That I have here brought these thre lawes to confusyon; Now shall I be able to lyve here peaceablye, And make frowlyke chere, with âhey how, fryska jolye!â The Lawe of Nature I kest first in a leprye By the secrete helpe of Ydolatrye and Sodomye. The Lawe of Moses I made a crypple blynde, Avaryce and Ambycyon to helpe me were not behynde. And now Christes Lawe I have brent for heresye By helpe of False Doctryne and my cosyne Hypocresye. On these same thre lawes all other lawes depende And can not prevayle nowe these are at an ende. If christen governers do not these lawes upholde Their cyvyle ordynaunces wyll sone be very colde. Well, thys valeaunt George hath made them all to stoupe; Cheare now maye I make, and set cocke on the houpe. Fyll in all the pottes, and byd me welcome, hostesse, And go call me hyther myne owne swete mynyon Besse! Finit Actus quartus. Incipit Actus Quintus [Enter Vindicta Dei, otherwise Deus Pater, to join Infidelitas.] Vindicta Dei Quid gloriaris in malicia qui potens es in iniquitate? Thu vengeable wretche, replete with poyson and vyce, Why doest thu thus rejoyce in crueltie and malyce? Thynkest thu that God slepeth and wyll not hys defende, And that thy myschefe shall never have an ende? The bloude of innocentes to hym for vengeaunce call, And therfor thys houre must I fearcely upon the fall. Infidelitas Thu sprete of the ayre, I strayghtly conjure the here, By Panton and Craton, and charge the to com no nere. Vindicta Dei Thynkest thu to stoppe me with thy folysh conjuracyon, Whom God sendeth hyther for thy abhomynacyon? Infidelitas What art thu called? Thy name to me rehearce. Vindicta Dei I am Vindicta Dei, in ponnyshment most fearce; With water, with swerde, and with fyre I must the pearce. Infidelitas Be good in thy offyce, and thu shalt have moneye and meate. Vindicta Dei By fylthy rewardes thu cannyst not me intreate, But that I wyll do as God hath me commaunded; For if worldly gyftes my furye myght have changed The unyversall worlde had not bene drowned with water, Nor Sodome and Gomor with so fyery fearfull matter, Nor yet the Israelytes with terrour of the sworde, With hungre and pestylence in the anger of Gods worde. Pharao in Egipte the plages had never felte Myght I have bene stopped for sylver or for gelte. Into Egipte I brought ten terryble ponnyshmentes Upon the people, for breakynge hys commaundementes. Their wholsom waters I tourned into bloude; I multyplyed frogges to poyson therwith their foude; I made waspes and dranes them grevously to stynge, And all kyndes of flyes sone after ded I in brynge; Upon their cattel I threwe the foule pestylence, Both botche, byle and blayne they had for their offence; Lyghtenynges and haylynges destroyed their corne and frute; A swarme of hungry locustes their pastours destytute. The space of thre dayes I gave them palpable darkenesse; I slewe the first gooten of man and beast for thy rudenesâ For I never stryke but for the, Infydelyte. Infidelitas Stryke for me, quoth a? By the Mary masse I defye the! Vindicta Dei What, thu wylt not so, thy braynes are not so lyght. Infidelitas Anger me not to moch; for if thu do, I fyght. Vindicta Dei All that wyll not helpe thy wycked workynges now; Whan the stronger come, the weaker must nedes bowe. The Lawe of Nature infected thu hast with a leprye. Infidelitas Naye, it was not I, but that wytche Idolatrye, And that polde, shorne knave that men call Sodomye. Vindicta Dei Of whom spronge they first but of Infydelyte? Therfor thu shalt have that plage of penalte Whych they first tasted for their inyquyte. For these two vyces I drowned the worlde with water; In token wherof I plage the with the same matter. Hic Infidelitatem lympha percutit. Infidelitas Tush! I defye thy worst. Thys shall not dryve me hence, For after the floude with Cham had I resydence, And so contynued tyll Moyses lawe came in, With hys jolye tryckes a newe rule to begyn. Vindicta Dei And hym thu corruptedest with Avaryce and Ambycyon, And so dedyst leave hym in myserable condycyon. Thu shalt have therfor that than to them was due. Most terryble battayle the Israelytes untrue That tyme ded suffer for their infydelyte; Wherfor with thys swerde I justlye bannysh the Bycause thu shalt here geve place to Christes Gospel. Gladio Infidelitatem denuo cedit. Infidelitas Yet wyll I not hens, but agaynst ones rebell. Ded not I remayne with Judas and other more? [Vindicta Dei] Whan Christ preached here and taught them [thu] vext hym sore. [Infidelitas] Yes, and after that was I with Simon Magus, With Saunder Coppersmyth, with Elimas and Demetrius. And now I persever amonge the ranke rable of papystes, Teachyng ther shorlynges to playe the Antichrystes. Vindicta Dei The innocent bloude of sayntes contynuallye Doth call unto God to revenge their injurye Agaynst false doctryne and cursed hypocresye, Whom thu hast raysed the glory of the Gospell To darken, and hys fryndes most myserably to quell. Wherfor thu shalt have lyke as thu hast deserved, For thy wycked doynges thy ponyshment now doubled. Ignis ipsum precedetâ the prophete David sayth thusâ Atque inflammabit in circuitu inimicos eius: A consumynge fyre shall ronne before the judge, Hys enemyes consumynge, they shal fynde no refuge. Ob scelera et culpas hominum ritusque nephandos In cineres ibit tellus, tenuemque favillamâ As Mantuan writeth âfor the wyckednesse of the The earth to ashes by fyre shall turned be. Ignis flamma Infidelitatem locum exire coget. Infidelitas Credo, credo, credo, I saye, credo, credo, credo! To the devyll of helle, by the messe, I wene I go. Exit [Infidelitas. Vindicta Dei becomes Deus Pater.] Deus Pater As ye have seane here how I have strycken with fyre The pestylent vyce of Infydelyte, So wyll I destroye in the fearcenesse of myne yre All sectes of errour with their enormyte, Whych hath rysen out of that inyquyte. For as it is sayd that my hande hath not sett Shall up by the rote, no power maye it lett. The apostle Johan in the Apocalyps doth saye He sawe a newe heaven and a newe earth aperynge, The olde earth and see were taken cleane awaye; That heaven is mannys fayth, that earth hys understandynge, Whom we have renued by our most secret workynge; The olde cancred earth exylynge with the see, Whych is superstycyon and infydelyte. A newe Hierusalem the sayd Johan also se As a bewtyfull bryde prepared to her husbande. Our true faythfull churche is that same fayr cytie Whom we have clensed by the power of our ryght hande, As a spouse to Christ in every christen lande, Bannyshynge the sectes of Babylonicall poperye, That she in the sprete maye walke to our glorye. Resort ye thre lawes, for yow wyll I clere also Of soch infeccyons as by Infydelyte Ye have receyved, that ye with her maye go Declarynge the wayes of Christen lyberte, That us she maye take without perplexite For her only God, and be our people styll, In our lawes walkynge accordyng to our wyll.

Hens thu, Ambycyon, and cursed Covetousnes! I here bannysh yow from thys lawe ever doughtles. Lose not those tables whych are a token true, That thu in the flesh shalt evermore contynue. Thu, Lawe of the Gospell, though thu be last of all In operacyon yet thu art the pryncypall. From the I exyle Hypocresy and False Doctryne, With all that depende upon the papystycall lyne.

Man is our creature, and hath grace in our syght, To dwell with hym now is our whole hartes delyght. Man is our people, hys God we are agayne; With hym wyll we have contynuall resydence. Awaye wyll we wype from hym all sorowe and payne: He shall no longar dyspayre for hys offence, Nor have in hys sowle any carefull doubt of conscyence. The olde popyshnesse is past whych was dampnacyon; We have now renued our christen congregacyon. [Enter Fides Christiana.] Stande fourth Christen Fayth, and take our advertysement: We here appoynt the to governe our congregacyon.

To thy swete name, Lorde, prayse and perpetuall honoure! Fides Christiana It hath pleased God to put me in thys offyce To governe hys churche and christen congregacyon, And therin to do as ye shall me entyce. Geve me, I praye yow, soch wholsom exhortacyon As maye be to Man a clere edyfycacyon, And I wyll be glad to take your advertysement As it shall become any chylde obedyent. Christi Lex Ye speake it full wele, than marke what shall be sayed, And dylygentlye loke that it be obeyed. Naturae Lex The effect of me is for to knowe the Lorde Everlastynge, stronge, most gracyouse and godlye, And, as touchynge Man, to have fraternall concorde, Faver to norrysh, and to do non injurye, To kepe covenauntes made, and love true matrymonye. These noble effectes so temper yow in Man That them to fulfyll he do the best he can. Moseh Lex The effect of me is for to worshyp the Lorde As one God alone, and to fle from Idolatrye; Not to slee nor stele, nor yet to beare false recorde; To shewe what is synne and to seke the remedye; Publyque peace to holde, and sore to ponnysh the gyltye. From these good effectes se that Man never swerve; Than shall he be sure that God wyll hym preserve. Christi Lex The effect of me is for to love the Lorde In the innar sprete, and to faver frynde and enmye, And in all poyntes els with Gods wyll to accorde; To preache remyssyon, to save and to justyfye; In Christ all to seke âlyfe, justyce, peace and mercye. These heavenly effectes in Man so incorporate That he maye in sprete be newlye regenerate. Fides Christiana More swete than honye are your thre exhortacyons, And regestred they be in my memoryall. Now wyll I forewarde to all the christen nacyons, And se in effect these lawes observed all, To the abolyshment of the dreames papystycall. Now the lyght is come, the darkenesse dyeth awaye; I trust in the Lorde men wyll walke in the daye. Good christen people, to these thre lawes applye: First knowe that ye have a lyvynge God above; Than do hym honour and hys name magnyfye; Worshyp hym in spret, as the Gospel yow doth move; Than obeye your kynge lyke as shall yow behove, For he in hys lyfe that Lorde doth represent To savegarde of the just and synners ponnyshment. Se that ye regarde soch lawes as he doth make, For they are of God as Salomon doth report. Of these lawes doubtles those lawes their groundynges take To the publyque welth to geve ayde, strength and confort, For preservacyon of all the christen sort. In no case folowe the wayes of Reygnolde Pole; To hys dampnacyon he doubtles playeth the fole. Have a due respect unto your contreye natyve, Whych hath brought ye up and geven ye norryshment, Even from your cradles to these dayes nutrytyve, So that ye maye do, to her welth and preferment, Mynyster to her no hatefull detryment. A dogge to hys frynde wyll never be unlovynge; Lete reason in ye not lose hys naturall workynge. Naturae Lex Who lyveth without lawe shal perysh without lawe, And therfor we have thre lawes to yow descrybed, That after their lyve ye shuld in your lyvynge drawe. We have also shewed how they have bene corrupted By fowle idolaters, and sodomytes poluted, By covetouse prestes, and by ambycyouse prelates, Hypocryticall fryres, false doctours and false curates. Moseh Lex Who hath restored these same thre lawes agayne But your late Josias and valeaunt Kynge Henrye? No prynce afore hym toke ever yet soch payne From Englande to bannysh Idolatrye and fowle Sodomye, Covetousnes, Ambycyon, False Doctryne and Hypocresye. It was he that brought Christes veryte to lyght Whan he put the Pope with hys fylthynes to flyght.

Praye for Quene Kateryne, and the noble Lorde Protectour, With the whole counsell that God be their directour. Amen. [Exeunt.]</field>
