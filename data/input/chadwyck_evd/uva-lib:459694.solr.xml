But syth thou more delights in mentall then in vocall prayer &amp; both (good lord) of the are vnderstoode alyke, here after I will, in silence pray hopeinge thou wilt graunt my petition Heli who's this that kneeleth here, as though shee were at her deuotion? for her lipps seeme to moue, but no voyce I do here att all. woman how longe wilt thou be drunke? A little digest thy wyne that troubleth thee. Anna. Not so my lord: wt h in this brest of myne no wyne came, nor any thinge that doth inebriate on my word. But I haue powred out my soule, in the sight of our lord. Accompt not thy handmayde as one of the Daughters of Beliall though I accompt my selfe of women vnfortunat'st of all. for of the multitude of my sorrow, &amp; heauines I have spoken vntill this present tyme, hopeing our lord will to me listen. Heli In peace go &amp; the god of Israll to the graunt thy petition Anna. Would god thy handmayd might finde grace wt h thee. but I'l begone Heli. And so will I farewell good woman, for thee to god I'l pray that good successe thy suite may haue wc h thou hast made this day. Nuncius. You must suppose, now that two or three yeares are past &amp; gone &amp; that Elcana in this tyme hath his wyfe Anna knowne &amp; our lord hath remembred her: for yt ys come to passe that she conceiued hath a sonne as her petition was who is already borne, &amp; by the name of Samuell called because when she was barren she of our lord had hym desyred &amp; her husband Elcana 's gone to immolate wt h his family the solemne host vnto our Lord, exceptinge Anna only, who ys not gone, but stayes at home untill her child be weaned, [&amp;] then to bringe hym thither, &amp; leaue hym there for ay she's mynded [the sat]isfaction of her vow wc h shee before hath made [where to] Elcan' agreede &amp; bade her do as shee hath sayd: so that yf you'l expect a whyle, &amp; patience haue a litle you shall see her come wt h the child to offer hym in the temple in Silo to our Lord accordinge to her resolution as I to you declared haue: and now I will begone. Anna. Husband Elcana now I haue my child from his papp weaned where fore let's to the temple go, that vp he may be offered by vs to god who at my prayer did hym on vs bestow &amp; that I may lykewyse performe vnto our lord my vow. Elcana. Wt h all my heart, &amp; Heli's here ready hym to receiue Anna. He ys in deede: This fals out well. Lord Heli by your leaue I am the woman that before you kneel'd here lately prayinge. vnto our Lord for this same child, wh[o] graunted hath my askinge &amp; therefore I here offer hym vp vnto our lord agayne that he his minister in the temple for euer may remayne. Heli. And I receiue at thy hands: God blesse thee pritty child &amp; geue the grace; for thou a countenance hast modest &amp; myld. Anna My heart reioyceth in our lord, who hath heard my petition &amp; I will euer prayse his name for his great benediction. There ys none holy as he ys, nor any one so mighty who doth the barren fruitfull make &amp; cause their seede to multiply &amp; rayseth the pore from the dust, &amp; the rych pulleth downe humbleth the proud, thee meeke exalts, &amp; brings them to thy throne who knowes the hearts, &amp; reynes doth search &amp; euery one rewardeth wt h good or bad as they deserue, &amp; all things iustly iudgeth. To serue hym freedome ys: &amp; therefore freely I my sonne to hym committ (my lord) &amp; to your fatherly tuition Elcana. And all my interest in hym I do yield vp as willingly my lord as shee hath done, and hym bequeath vnto gods ministery Heli. I both you do commend for lyke good parents you haue done &amp; carefully I'l see that he do exercise his function. &amp; so I bid you both adew, for now I must be gone. Elcana, Anna. God be your speede. Elca[na]. farewell my child. An[na]. Adew Samuell my sonne. god prosper thee, &amp; make the growe &amp; please both god &amp; men &amp; god that sent thee may hereafter blesse me wt h mo children Yf he thinke good, vnto whose will my self I do referre in this &amp; all thinges els. but homeward now lets go tog [ether.] Heli. God speede you, &amp; Elcana I beseech our lord to re[store] thee seede of this same woman &amp; of many children [more] for th'vsery wc h on our lord you freely haue bestowed at whose hands no good worke escapes vnrecom[pensed.] Nuncius You must suppose that sundry yeares are passed now &amp; gone synce samuel offered was to god, &amp; that he's now much growne in stature &amp; perfection, &amp; pleaseth both god &amp; men &amp; that god hath his mother Anna blest now wt h mo children. But Heli the high priests sonnes are become children of Beliall &amp; of gods seruice do make litle accompt, or none at all. but take vnto them selues the victimes by the people immolated &amp; do their owne turnes serue before they will let god be serued &amp; wt h the women sleepe who at the dore wayte of the tabernacle &amp; Heli knowinge all these thinges that his sonnes do to Israell only tells them there of, but makes them not their faults amend wherefore yt's to be feard that god some plague will to hym send &amp; by a man of god no lesse vnto hym be hath signifyed who told hym there should neuer be in's house a man that's aged but all dye at mans state, In token whereof he did say Helis two sonnes Ophni &amp; phinees should both dye in one day &amp; that a faythfull priesthood to hym self god vp wyll rayse who shall accordinge to his heart &amp; soule hym euer prayse for whom he 'l buyld a faythfull house, wc h before his christ faythfully shall euer walke, th'euent expect. Now Samuell before heli begins to minister to our lord: &amp; in these dayes most rare the worde of our lord ys, when as no visions usuall are. But here now Heli cominge ys wt h Samuell in his company &amp; both about are to lye downe, for yt semes they are sleepy wt h watchinge in the Temple all night longe, for almost morninge yt's now. Marke you well what will follow, &amp; so I will be goinge God. Samuel. Sam[uel]. Lo here my lord Heli I am, for thou did call me Heli I cald thee not: returne &amp; sleepe. Sam[uel]. my lord I'l be gone presently God. Samuel Sam[uel]. Lo here my lord heli I am, for thou did call mee Heli I cal'd thee not my sonne returne &amp; sleepe. Sam[uel]. I am gone already God Samuel. Sam[uel]. Lo my lord Heli here I am, because thou cal'd me Heli Now perfectly I vnderstand yt was our lord that cald thee. Samuell go sleepe agayne, &amp; yf he shall call the here after say speake lord for thy seruant heares. Sam[uel]. I will say in yt maner. God. Samuel, Samuel; Sam[uel]. Speake lord thy seruant heares. God. Behold in Israell a thinge Il do wc h he that heareth both his eares shall tingle. All that I spoken haue I will agaynst Heli vp rayse touchinge his house wc h I'l begin t'accomplish in his dayes, &amp; (as I hym fore told) will his house iudge for all eternity because he chastis'd not his sonnes knowinge that they did wickedly for I haue sworne that the iniquity of the house of Heli for his offence wt h victimes neuer shall expiated bee. Samuel Now morninge's come I'l ryse: but I this vision dare not tell to my Lord Heli, lest yt hym trouble. Heli. Samuel my sonne Samuell. Samuel Lo here I am my lord. Heli what ys the worde our lord spake to thee? I thee beseech in any wyse do not conceale yt from mee. Thesse &amp; these thinges do god to thee yf any word be concealed by thee from me of all that god vnto thee hath revealed Samuel I will not one omitt: Thus sayth our lord: Behold in Israel a thinge I'l do, wc h he that heareth both his eares shall tingle. All that I spoken haue I will agaynst Heli vp rayse touchinge his house, wc h I'l begin t'accomplish in his dayes &amp; (as I hym fore told) will his house iudge for all eternity because he chastis'd not his sonnes knowinge that they did wickedly for I haue sworne that the iniquity of the house of Heli for his offence wt h victimes neuer shall expiated bee. Heli Yt was our lord. Let hym do that wc h ys good in his eyes. but that we may be gone, syth yt's high tyme, I will aryse Nuncius The philisthijms assembled are wt h Israel for to fight: &amp; Israel pitched hath their campe wt h in the philisthijms sight &amp; as it seemes they ready are the battell to begin for heare they strike th'alarum, &amp; the Trumpets sound wt h in Mahalim. Alas we Israelits, to turne our backes haue now bene forced wt h the losse of foure thousand men wc h on our part were killed why hath our lord before the philisthijms strooken vs this same day? The Arke of our lord that's in Silo let's fetch thence away. &amp; let yt come into the midst of vs, vs for to saue from the hands of our foes, who at this tyme the victory haue Loyolus Your counsel's good: I hope the rest of Israell will consent so for to do, wherefore let's go, &amp; send for yt in continent Mahalim The Arke of god is come into our campe: let's all be glad. whaw, whaw, whaw, whaw Phalech What sodayne shout is this, that in the Hebrews camp ys made? Melpo Surely god's come into their campe, Alas &amp; wayleaway No such reioyceinge there was two dayes since, nor yesterday. Phalech wo's vs who shall vs from the hands of these high gods defende? These are the gods that such greate plagues did in to Ãgipt sende Take courage, &amp; be men yee Philisthijms lest yee be forced to serue the Hebrewes as in former tymes they haue you serued. Corragious bee &amp; fight for eyther by you they'l be slayne as yesterday they were, or els be forc't to flee agayne. And how so euer yt ys better lyke valyant men to dye then lyue as slaues: wherefore let's go, &amp; sett vpon them presently. Heli Alas what tumults this I heare, &amp; yet I can see no body. my eye sight ys so dimme with age, for now I am full nintye &amp; eight yeares olde: I'l here sitt downe ouer agaynst the way beinge fearefull for gods arke &amp; listen what they do &amp; say. Nerio Oh what a slaughter here hath bene of th'Israelits my brethren where of the number kild, amounts to thirty thousand foote men &amp; all the rest are fled &amp; gone ech man vnto his Tabernacle. &amp; I a man of Beniamin am runne out of the battell wt h garments rent &amp; torne, &amp; my head all wt h dust besprinkled to Heli for to bringe this newes: whom here I haue espyed. my Lord. Heli. who's there? Nerio. I am he that's returned from ye battell &amp; I hee that's fled from the fielde, &amp; come thee newes to tell. Heli. What's done my sonne? Nerio. Israell before the philisthijms are fled &amp; many of thy people kild: &amp; thy two sonnes are deade Ophni &amp; phinees this same day: &amp; th'Arke of god ys taken. Alas my lord ys backward fallen, &amp; his necke ys quite broken wc h accident (as yt should seeme) through griefe to hym did happen wc h he conceiu'ed, when that he hear'd that th'Arke of god was taken. This Zeale of his towards god's arke a great signe's that he dyed in good state, though for not punishinge his sonnes he be thus punished wt h temporall affliction, wc h a presedent may bee. vnto all parents how they let their children haue their liberty &amp; do not them correct, when they offend Almighty god for wc h they sure are in the ende to feele his scourge &amp; rod. either in this world, as Heli did, or in the world to come for all are as they haue deseru'd for to receiue their doome not only for the synne wc h by them selues committed was but also for their bearinge wt h an others fault &amp; trespas that ys wt h in their charge, wether yt be child, seruant, or scholer for all superiours must for their inferiours strictly answeare. Where fore all you that haue a charge keepe them in due subiection &amp; so fare well, for with Heli s dead body now I'l be gone, Nuncius You haue seene Heli's sodayne death from the lyke god deliuer you as by his grace he will, yf you be carefull that you doe not as he did, but duly looke to all vnder your gouerment &amp; chastice them yf they offende, till you see their amendment. At the tyme Heli dyed he fourty yeares had iudged Israell. &amp; when of his &amp; Phinees death his daugter in law heard tell &amp; how the Arke of god was taken, beinge greate wt h child &amp; nigh the ende of her accompt, she was for greefe deliuered presently of a man childe, &amp; dye'd her self, &amp; the Philisthijms went on wt h th'Arke, &amp; yt in Dagons temple sett nigh vnto Dagon wc h temple in Azotus stands, &amp; the priestes the next day found Dagon on the ground before th'Arke wc h wt hout delay they did in to his place restore. And lyke wyse the next morninge they Dagon found agayne before th'Arke flatt vpon th'earth lyinge wt h both palmes of his hands &amp; head cutt off vpon the threshold &amp; for that cause untill this day they yt unlawfull hould on Dagons threshold for to treade entringe in to his Temple &amp; for detayninge of the Arke god made their fieldes to buble, &amp; the whole country fild wt h myse. Also he to them sent an other plague wc h troubled them in the secret part of the fundament, wc h made th'Azotians say: Let th'Arke no longer make abode amongst vs, for gods hand is sore on vs &amp; on our god: And callinge all the princes of the Philisthijms to gether they sayd: what sall we doe wt h Arke of god? where to this answeare was by the Gethits made: Let th'Arke of god about be caryed, wc h to them graunted was, and by them willingly performed: for wc h our Lord through euery citty made an exceedinge slaughter &amp; Emoroyds in their secret parts they had both lesse &amp; greatter &amp; of skynes made them stooles, &amp; sent the Arke of god to Accaron The people whereof cryed out &amp; sayd: Gods Arke they haue brought downe to vs, to kill vs &amp; our people. And streight they did assemble the philisthijms, &amp; mou'd them to send gods Arke agayne to Israell: for there was made the feare of god in euery Towne &amp; Citty through all the philisthijms lands because gods hand on them was heauy. But th'Arke for to returne the priests &amp; southsayers gaue aduise not empty hand, but wt h fyue golden Emeroyds, &amp; fyue myse accordinge to the number of the provinces of their country in memory of the plagues vpon them layd by god Almighty &amp; to the god of Israel to geue glory they them comman'd yf haply hee would stay his hand from them, their goods, &amp; land &amp; askt them why they would their hearts lyke th'Ãgiptians harden &amp; pharao sayinge: He them dismist after that they were stryken by whose perswation they the Arke to Israell backe returned sett in wayne drawne by two kyne, the wc h had lately calued who vnto Bethsaims went directly wt h yt, &amp; there they stayed where by the Southsayers knew that by gods hand they had bene touched. And when the Bethsamits saw the Arke comeinge they were right glad &amp; streight the wane in peeces cutt, &amp; the kyne there on layd for victims to our lord, so soone as th'Arke was taken downe by the Leuits: But yet the Arke they used not so reuerently as they ought to haue done, but bared yt to looke there on in th'open ayre wt h out torch light, wc h was not th'vsuall fashion. for wc h god of the chieffest men of Bethsaimes did stryke seuenty wt h a great plague, &amp; fifty thousand also of the commonalty: where at they grieued were, &amp; mourninge sayd in thys same wyse: who's able for to stand in our lords sight that holy ys? &amp; to whom shall he go from vs? And forth wt h they sent word to Cariathiarim sayinge: vnto you fetch th'Arke of our Lord the wc h was by the philisthijms brought to vs: &amp; they of caria Thiarim caryed vnto Abinadabs house in Gabaa wt h great respect, &amp; sanctifyed Eleazar his sonne that he th'Arke of our lord might keepe, as other afore had done: where yt a longe tyme did remayne, and at request of Samuell the Israelits did only serue our lord the god of Israell &amp; cast Baalim their vayne god, &amp; Astoroth away &amp; in Masphath assembled, where Samuel did for them pray: And god his prayer heard, &amp; on the philisthijms god so thundred that many were slayne, &amp; the rest fled, &amp; Israel no more troubled in Samuels dayes. And all the cities that were taken euery one from Israel by the philisthijms were restor'd from Geth to Accaron And Samuel growinge now in yeares, his sonnes Iudges appoynted of Israel hath, who in his wayes walke not, but are inclyned to couetousnes, &amp; takeing bribes, &amp; pervertinge of Iudgment. for wc h all the Auncients of Israel haue to Samuell sent requestinge hym t'appoynt to them a kinge before he dye by whom they may be gouerned as all other nations bee And what answeare he will them geue, as yet yt ys not knowne but patience haue a whyle, &amp; you shall heare: so I'l be gone.

Nuncius Where as god hath the Israelits unto hym self selected for his peculier people, &amp; by priestes &amp; Iudges ruled them till this tyme, &amp; rays'd them vp in an vnvsuall maner them from their foes, when they distressed were, for to deliuer, They now demaunded haue a kinge (as other nations haue) to be their lord, and god refus'd, who hither to did them saue: desyringe for to charge the forme &amp; order of his gouerment, wc h god highly displeas'd. wherefore Samuel by gods appoyntment fore told them what a kinge might do by his supreame authority yf from the rules of iustice he do swarue, &amp; fall to tyranny that he there by might them disswade from choosinge of a kinge: yet they in that poynt are so stiffe that they will take no warninge but still at Samuels hands expect a kinge: &amp; what a one he'l for them choose here after shall appeare: So I'l be gone. Cis Sonne Saul my Asses I haue lost, where fore I pray thee take one of my seruants wt h thee &amp; go &amp; inquiry make for them, &amp; till thou do returne I will at home remayne Saul father cis I will, &amp; they beinge founde I'l come to you agayne.

And as concerninge th'Asses wc h are lost take thou no care for they are found three days agoe. and whose ys ech best thinge of Israel? Is yt not to thee &amp; thy fathers house belonginge? Saul How? am not I the sonne of Iemini, of the least tribe of Israel? amongst the families last of Beniamins tribe the truth to tell. What makes the therefore for to speake vnto me on this fashion? Samuel Here after that vnto thee I'l impart: now let's be gone. Saul bid thy seruant go alonge before vs on the way that I may tell thee what our lord bade me to thee do &amp; say. Saul Strophi go on before, &amp; after thee wee will come presently. Samuel Kneele downe Saul that I may thee kisse, &amp; wt h this oyle annoynt thee Behold our lord hath vpon his inheritance thee annoynted wt h this litle vessell of oyle wc h I vpon thy head haue powred to be prince, &amp; thou shalt deliuer his people from their foes that rounde about them are: In signe where of as thou home goes this day two men thou shalt fynde by the Sepulcher of Rachel in Beniamin, who shall thee tydinges of thy Asses tell, &amp; say th'Asses thou went to seeke are founde out: &amp; thy father lettinge the Asses go, takes care for you, &amp; sayth more ouer What shall I do touchinge my sonne?

Immediatly as Saul his backe of Samuell turned had god chang'd his heart, &amp; all things came to passe as Samuel sayde &amp; Saul meetinge the prophets at the fore sayd hill did prophecy wt h them, at sight where of there was great wonder made by many. Where of one sayd vnto an other: what a strange thinge ys this? Is Saul amongst the prophets? What's hapened to the sonne of Cis? So that yt was vnto the people into a prouerbe turned what's Saul also amongst the prophets? &amp; to prophecy he ceased. &amp; Samuels gone the Tribes of Israell for to call to gether that he a message from our lord vnto them may deliuer. Where of yf you will knowledge haue a while shew but attention &amp; yt apparent shall be made: &amp; so I will be gone. Samuel Breethren our lord the god of Israel bade mee call you to gether &amp; you in mynde put how from Ãgipt he dyd you deliuer &amp; from the hands of all the kinges, where wt h you were afflicted &amp; you yet not wt hstandinge haue your lord your god reiected &amp; you haue sayd: not so: but ouer vs appoynt a kinge as other Nations haue: &amp; our lord's now there to consentinge where fore stande here before our lord by all your tribes &amp; families &amp; you shall fynde by lott, who for your kinge elected ys. Melon Behold the lot vpon the tribe of Beniamin ys fallen &amp; Saul the sonne of Cis of metri's kinne by lott ys chosen but where he ys we cannot tell. Lord will he not come hither? God Behold at home he lyeth hyd. People Come let's go streight way thither Samuel Low they haue saul found out, &amp; wt h hym they are cominge hitherward behold he's higher then the rest by the shoulder &amp; vpwarde. Certes you see the man, whom our lord god for kinge hath chosen There is not one that's lyke to hym amongst you all my Brethren People of Israel we wt h our owne eyes see it ys most true. God saue the kinge Samuel And the law of the kingdome here to you I geue in wrytinge. &amp; now dismisse you euery one to his owne house to go People of Israel. God saue the kinge. Come let's attend on hym, for duty bidds so Nuncius Wt h Saul now part of th'Armie's gone, they whose hearts god had touched. But such as the children of Belial bee, haue hym despysed &amp; would not wt h hym go, nor any presents to hym gaue but sayd: what shall this fellow able be vs for to saue &amp; yet for all that Saul was not offended wt h those people but did most prudently, as though he had not heard dissemble. Since wc h tyme beinge as yt were a month, Naas the Amonite ascended ys, &amp; agaynst Iabes Galaad begins to fight But ere the warres proceede, to parle both of them are contented where fore geue eare &amp; you shall heare how things will be concluded betwixt them for the parties are both comminge here at hand. Naas king of Amelec. Now we are come to parle. What do you Galaadits demaund? Mompelio Naas conclude a league wt h vs, &amp; willingly we'l serue thee Naas vpon condition I may pull out euery mans right eye &amp; in all Israel make you a reproch, I am content Mompelio. Seuen dayes respyte geue vs there on to thinke till we haue sent messengers to all the coasts of Israel, &amp; yf then there shall not be founde men vs to defende, we'l be contented all to serue thee vpon the conditions that now thou dost requyre. Naas Agreede, let's go: no more of you at this tyme I desyre Nuncius. The Galaadits to Gabaa sent of Saul, &amp; to them shewed their greate distresse, wc h when they hearde, they pittifully complayned &amp; Saul comminge from the fielde followinge of oxen, to them sayd what ys the cause the people weepe, and are so yll apay'd? And they hym told, &amp; then the spirit of our lord on Saul seysed &amp; he, growinge exceedinge wroth, the oxen streight diuided into smale peeces, wc h he sent to all the coasts of Israell sayinge who s' euer shall not go forth &amp; follow Saul &amp; Samuell vnto his oxen so yt shall be done: wherefore the feare of our lord did invade the people, &amp; they did as yt were one man go forth before Saul, &amp; in Bezec he them numbred &amp; there of the children of Israel were Thousands three hundred &amp; men of Iuda thyrty thousand, wo to the messengers sayd that came: Thus shall you say to them that are in Iabes Galaad To morrow you shall haue reliefe, when the sunne hote shall be wc h answeare made the messengers glad, &amp; they return'd home presently And the Galaadits this morninge haue vnto the Ammonits told they would forth to them come, &amp; they should use them as they would. But they their enemyes haue deluded by equivocation as forth wt h shall appeare, when both meete in the field in person as they about are for to do: for now they stryke th Alarum where fore yt's my best to be gone, before they do forth come Mompelio. We of the Ammonits this day haue made a mighty slaughter &amp; of them that escapt wt h lyfe, there's not two lefte together but one dispersed from an other, &amp; by the helpe of saul this victory we gotten haue, who in the midst of all their campe prest in, haueinge his host into three partes deuided &amp; there wt h on a sodayne them couragiously assaulted. Now tell vs Samuel who they bee that lately sayd: Shall Saul reigne ouer vs? geue vs the men, &amp; wee will kill them all. Saul. Not one man shall be slayne this day, syth god hath relieud Israel Samuel. Then let's be gone the kingdome to renewe agayne in Galgal Israel behold I haue you heard accordinge to ech thinge you spake to me, &amp; ouer you appoynted haue a kinge. whom you have chosen in Galgal also before you for to goe. &amp; I am waxen olde, &amp; my heires gray begin to growe, &amp; my sonnes wt h you are: &amp; from my youth conuerst I haue wt h you: Tell me before god &amp; his christ, wc h of you gaue me oxe, or Asse vntill this day, &amp; whether I haue oppressed any one of you, or haue any gifte at any mans hand receiued, &amp; I'l yt vnto you restore agayne, &amp; that most willingly. People of Israel. Thou hast oppressed none of vs, nor taken ought of any. Samuel. Let our lord &amp; his christ agaynst you witnesse be. People. witnesse. Samuel. Your fathers out of Ãgipt were brought by the hand of Moyses &amp; they forgott our lord their god, for wc h he them deliuered to Sisara maister of the Host of Hosor, &amp; vnto the philisthijms, and the kinge of Moab, who did them much hurt do But afterward they to our lord cryed, &amp; sayd: we haue synned in that we haue reiected our lord god, &amp; other gods serued. And when the[y] did repent, our lord did sende Gedeon &amp; Samson &amp; Iept' and Samuel, who haue you deliuered from affliction: Yet when you saw Naas the kinge of th'Ammonits you invade (where as our lord reign'd ouer you, you came to mee &amp; sayd: Not so: but a kinge ouer vs shall reigne: where fore a kinge god hath geuen you, &amp; such a one as ys of your owne choosinge. Wherefore yf you will serue our lord, &amp; to his voyce geue eare hee'l both you &amp; your kinge protect. But yf you will not feare &amp; serue our lord, his hand will be vpon you &amp; your fathers. In signe where of at my request god will cause rayne &amp; Thunders immediatly, although yt be wheate haruest this same day, wc h vsually from Thunder's free. And now to god I'l pray. Lord for the confirmation of my speech, let rayne &amp; Thunder come from the skyes, &amp; make this people in a great maze &amp; wonder. People of Israel. Exceedingly we are a-feard both of our lord &amp; Samuel for the lyke thunder clapp was neuer heard before in Israel. Samuel pray for thy seruants to our lord lest he vs kill for in desyreinge of a kinge we graunt we haue done yll &amp; many wayes els offended god both in thought deede &amp; word. Samuel Yet for all that do not depart from the backe of our lord, but faythfully serue hym, &amp; he will neuer you for sake for he hath sworne you to hym self a people for to make. And farre be yt from me that I should cease for you to pray: &amp; besyds that I'l tell you wc h ys the good &amp; right way. Feare our lord &amp; serue hym in truth from your whole heart syth now you haue seene what great workes &amp; wonders he hath done for you. But yf in synne &amp; wickednes hereafter you perseuer, both you your selues &amp; your kinge also shall perish all to gether But now yt's tyme that you were gone an army to prepare agaynst the philisthijms who your old professed enemyes are. Nuncius. You must imagin now that Saul two complet yeares hath reigned &amp; duringe all that tyme for innocency he was compared vnto a child of one yeare old: but since he fell to synne by offeringe vp of sacrifice, wc h hath peculiar byn vnto the priest, not to a kinge, where of he yet presumed only because samuel came not iust at the tyme appoynted, but made Saul Seuen dayes expect, in whose absence the people from hym did slipp away, for wc h offence &amp; synne by Samuel be was reprou'd, &amp; told that his kingdome should be translated from hym vnto an other, &amp; that god hath a man prouided accordinge vnto his owne heart, who shall his place supply &amp; prince be of his people when be shall depryued bee. And Saul, &amp; his sonne Ionathas haue wt h the Philisthijms encountred &amp; at the first Philisthijms got worse, but after they oppressed the Israelits, &amp; not one Smyth they left in all their land So that they forced were to go wt h coulters in their hand, &amp; spades, axes, &amp; forkes, wc h they did whett when blunt they were for not one of them all to fight wt h had eyther sword or speare exceptinge Saul &amp; Ionathas, but wt h in some fewe dayes after Ionathas trustinge in god accompanyed only wt h his Esquier vnto the Philisthijms Garrison went wt h out his fathers priuity sayinge for god yt ys as easy to saue in few as many &amp; betwixt them they twenty men did kill by god assisted &amp; all the Philisthijms campe besyds exceedingly they troubled. wc h when Saul vnderstood he came vnto hym wt h his Army &amp; wt h the Philisthijms did incounter &amp; got of them the victory. And where as Saul commanded had that no man on the payne of death should eate till night, Ionathas was iudged to be slayne for taystinge of a litle hony (though of the prohibition he ignorant was) yet death escapt by the peoples opposition. And Samuel since ys sent to Saul a message for to do from god, &amp; what that ys tyme shall discouer So I will leaue you Samuel Saul our lord sent me to annoyynt thee kinge ouer his people &amp; bids thee now consider what Amalec hath done to Israel how he wt h stood them in the way when they from Ãgipt came wherefore go strike hym &amp; destroy all he hath for the same. Spare neyther man, woman nor child, but kill them euery one, &amp; of their oxen, sheepe, camells, &amp; Asses lykewyse spare none wt h lyfe, but them destroy, &amp; what so euer else they haue Saul I'l streight begone, &amp; all thinges do as god commandment gaue God From Heuila to Sur that's agaynst Ãgypt saul hath stryken Amelec, &amp; hath alyue Agag the kinge of Amelec taken &amp; not put hym to death: &amp; he more ouer hath preserued all the best flockes of sheepe &amp; heardes, &amp; nothinge hath destroyed that's fayre: only the comon people he hath put to the sworde &amp; spoyled all that's vyle: where in he disobey'd my worde. Wherefore Samuel yt me repents, that I haue made Saul kinge because he my commandment hath not done in euery thinge Samuel Yet not wt h standinge lord, yf he shall for his synne be sory I trust as thou hast done to others, thou wilt of hym haue mercy though I confesse he foolishly agaynst the lord hath done &amp; for to tell hym what thou sayst Lord now I will begone. Saul. Blest be thou Samuel of our lord, whose word I haue fulfilled Samuel What voyce of flockes &amp; heards were these then yt in myne eares sounded? Saul The people haue the better sheepe &amp; heards of Amelech spared &amp; brought them wt h them that they might to our lord god be immolated but ye rest we have slayne. Sam[uel]. Saul yf that thou wilt me permitt I'l tell the what our lord hath spoken vnto me this night. Saul. Speake. Sam[uel]. Saul tell me when yu a litle one was in thyne owne eyes was thou not made chiefe in the tribes of Israel, &amp; dyd ryse to honour, &amp; by our lord the kinge of Israel was annoynted? &amp; now he sent thee vnto Amelec, &amp; also thee commanded to put them all vnto the sword, &amp; bade thee not spare one of them, nor any thinge that was theirs, but make of all destruction &amp; thou hast not heard our lords voyce, but some things hast preserued contrary to his will, &amp; euill in his sight committed Saul. Nay I the voyce of our lord heard, &amp; walked in his way &amp; Agag kinge of Amelec brought, &amp; Amelec I did slay but of the pray that gotten was the people brought ye principall wt h them to immolate them vnto our lord their god in Galgal Samuel. Why farre more gratefull to our lord obedience ys then sacrifice &amp; therefore in omittinge that for this thou was vnwyse &amp; for as much as thou hast the voyce of our lord reiected hee hath reiected thee, &amp; of thy kingdome thee depryued Saul I synned haue in that I did transgresse our lords commandment &amp; thyne, &amp; for feare of the people to their voyce gaue consent. But now beare I beseech the wt h my synne, &amp; returne wt h me that I our lord god may adore. Sam[uel]. I will not returne wt h thee. Syth thou reiected hast our lord hath thee reiected &amp; thou shalt not the kinge of Israel be, but be deposed Saul Stay Samuel stay: I pray the stay. what hast yu torne my garment? Samuel Our lord this day the kingdome hath of Israel from the rent &amp; to thy neighbour that's better then thou hath yt deliuered. Israels triumpher will not spare, nor's wt h repentance turned. Saul I synned haue, yet me before th'Auncients of Israel honour &amp; now wt h me returne, that I our lord god may adore. Samuel. I am content to go wt h thee, wherefore leade me the way to Galgal, &amp; I'l after come, &amp; that wt h out delay. Nuncius When Saul adored had our lord, Samuel did bid hym bringe to hym Agag the kinge of Amelec, whom he brought to hym trembling To whom (quoth Samuel) thy sword hath made women wt h out children So wt h out children thy mother shall be made now amongst women And Samuel hewed hym in peeces before our lord in Galgal. wc h done Samuel lefte Saul neuer to see hym more at all but yet his case lamented sore, because yt had repented our lord that he had hym the kinge ouer Israel appoynted. But whom our lord will choose for kinge in sauls place yet s not knowne but patience haue &amp; you shall shortly see. So I'l be gone. God. Samuel. Sam[uel]. Here lord. God. tell me how longe for Saul will yu yet mourne? for that I haue reiected hym? wt h oyle go fill thy horne that I to Isai may the sende, who ys in Bethleem dwellinge for I amongst his sonnes haue me prouided of a kinge. Samuel. How shall I thither goe? for Saul will heare thereof &amp; kill mee God A calfe thou shalt take of the heard a longe to Bethleem wt h thee &amp; tell them thou art thither come vnto our lord to sacrifice: &amp; to the victime thou shalt Isai call, &amp; then what ys for to be done I'l to the shew: &amp; hym thou shalt annoynt whom s'euer I shall to thee shew, name, nominate, &amp; appoynt. Where fore be gone, &amp; ready make all thinges fit for thy iourney. Samuel Thy will in this &amp; all thinges else to do lord I am ready. Nuncius Now Samuel ys to Bethleem come, where th'Auncients of ye citty meetinge hym, &amp; much musinge what brought hym into yt country, sayd to hym: ys thy entrance peaceable? peaceable quoth he yt ys for I am come vnto this place to our lord god to sacrifice: Sanctifyed be ye, come go wt h me: &amp; they went wt h hym presently. &amp; when he immolat't had, he Isai &amp; his sonnes did sanctify. And what more he will say or do to them will streight be knowne for Samuel here wt h Isai comes, &amp; Eliab his el'dst sonne. Samuel. Ys there before our lord his christ? Shew me lord as thou promised God His face respect not, nor his stature, for I haue hym reiected because I do not iudge accordinge to the looke of man for man sees those thinges that appeare: But t'hart behold god can Isai Eliab go hence, &amp; hither send Aminadab thy brother Samuel Neyther hath our lord chosen this. Isai. Go &amp; send Samma hither Samuel. Neyther this same hath our lord chosen. Isai. my other foure sonnes forth bringe Samuel None of these foure will our lord choose of Israel to be kinge. Are all thy sonnes now fully come? Isai. No there's yet left a litle one who feedeth sheepe. Sam[uel]. Send for hym streight: for I will not sit downe vntill he come. Isai. Sones go &amp; send Dauid my yongst sonne to me. Samuel Is this thy sonne that ys so redd, fayre to behold, &amp; comely?

Nuncius. Dauid from Saul's return'd to keepe his fathers sheepe agayne &amp; now the philisthijms camped are on th'one syde of ye mountayne &amp; Saul &amp; Israel on the other, &amp; they in battell aray their Armies both of them have put: &amp; there comes euery day into the valley that doth lye betwene their seuerall Armyes from the philisthians campe one that's a bastard borne &amp; chalenges all Israel in a single combate wt h them there for to fight, whose name Goliath ys of Geth, &amp; the man ys in height fyue cubits &amp; a palme, &amp; a brase helmet's on his heade, &amp; he's cloth'd in a coate of male that lynked ys &amp; weyed fyue thousand brasen sicles, &amp; brasen bootes he also weareth vpon his thighes, &amp; a Target of brasse his shoulders couereth. And his speares shaft vnto a weauers beame may be compared, &amp; the very yron there of six hundred sicles of yron weighed. And his Esquier before hym goes. And he doth dayly ball out agaynst Israell sayinge: Are you not seruants vnto Saul &amp; I a Philisthijm? Then prepar'd to fight why do you stand? Choose out amongst you one for to fight wt h me hand to hand And yf he put me to the worse your seruants we will bee But vs you shall serue yf of hym I chaunce to to gett the victory. And he thus fourty dayes agaynst the Israelits hath bragged where at both Saul &amp; all the Israelits do stand astonyed and not one of them all ys founde that dare wt h hym encounter for they are litle dwarfe, &amp; he's a gyant compar'd to gether. But lately Isai hath sent Dauid vp vnto his Brethren to visit them, who in the campe of Saul are fightinge men at whose arriual he Goliath heard Israel vpbraydinge, &amp; also saw the Israelits for feare from his face fleeinge: And one of Israel to hym sayd: Saw thou this man defy the Israelits? The man that shall hym ouercome shall marry the daughter of the kinge: &amp; he shall haue his fathers house &amp; no tribute for yt pay: &amp; the kinge to hym will be gratious. who's this vncircumcised philisthijm then to hym dauid sayd that here the Armies of the lyuinge god dare thus vpbrayd? And when his speeches were told to Eliab his Elder brother, Eliab offended was wt h hym, &amp; sayd, why cam'st thou hither? &amp; where fore hast thou lefte the sheepe wc h thou kept in the desert? full well I do thy pryde know, &amp; the wickednes of thy hearte Through thy desyre to see this batle fought thou art come downe Had I not iust cause so to doe quothee? what haue I done? And all the wordes that Dauid spake were to kinge Saul related and Dauid forth wt h to [be] brought before hym hee Commanded But what he will vnto hym say as yet ys knowne to none but shortly you shall heare, yf you'l geue eare. So I'l begone. Saul Of what stock ys this yonge man come? Abner canst thou not tell me? Abner thy soule lyueth o kinge yf I do know this yonge mans famyly Saul Inquiry make there of, &amp; when thou knowes let me know also Abner That will I do dreede Soueraigne lord &amp; bringe hym to you to Dauid Let no man daunted bee for I thy seruant wil bee the man that will in single combate fight wt h this same proude Philistian Saul Thou art but yet a child, &amp; much to weake wt h hym to fight who from his youth hath bene a warriour and's of great strength &amp; might.

Thou comes agaynst me both wt h sword &amp; speare. &amp; shield: But I come vnto thee (for all thy cracks &amp; boasts) in the name of the god of Israel, &amp; of the lord of hosts whom thou defyed hast this day, &amp; thee he'l geue vnto mee &amp; I shall stryke thee, &amp; thy head away take also from thee. &amp; the dead carcasses geue of the philisthijms campe this day to the foules of the ayre, &amp; beasts of th'earth there on to pray that all the earth may knowledge haue that there's a god in Israel &amp; all assembled here shall know that god (for yt's his battell) doth saue, not in the sworde &amp; speare: &amp; he will you deliuer into our hands: for proofe where of, haue at the wt h this stone. Lo I haue hitt hym in the fore head, &amp; hee ys fallen downe. And now with his owne sword I'l go &amp; streight cutt off his head. The victory now ys myne, for the philistian loe ys dead, &amp; the rest flee for feare seeinge the strongest of them slayne for wc h gods name be praysd, who made his brags to proue but vayne. Pursue them out of hand, for you may ouerthrow them easely now whyle they are in flight: And to Hierusalem this head I'l cary. Saul We haue the Philisthijms pursued vnto the gates of Accaron &amp; many of them we haue slayne, the rest are fled &amp; gone Abner The yonge man's here dreede Soueraigne lord that killed ye philistian. Saul That's well. of what kinred &amp; stocke art thou come of yonge man Dauid The sonne of thy seruant Isai the Bethleemite I am, who in the desert keepe his sheepe, &amp; Dauid ys my name. Ionathas. Dauid my soule vnto thy soule exceedinge fast ys ioyned Dauid And Ionathas my soule to thyne lyke wyse as fast ys lynked Ionathas A league betwixt vs then let's make: for as my soule I loue thee Dauid Content I am.

And hence forth Dauid thou no more returne shall to thy father but be imploy'd by me as there shall ministred be occasion Dauid I am dreede Soueraigne lord at your command. Saul. Then let's be gone. Nuncius Dauid now goes forth to all things, about wc h saul hym sendeth &amp; very wysely he hym self in euery thinge behaueth so that the kinge hath placed hym ouer his men of warre &amp; he's gratious in all mens eyes, especially theirs that are seruants to Saul, who loue hym dearely &amp; esteeme hym highly, wc h daunger may to Dauid bringe by styrringe saul to Ielousy of hym, when he calls to hys mynde what samuel hym fore tolde that he should be deposd, &amp; hym succeede an other should But what th'euent here of will bee as yet yt ys not knowne, but shortly will: where fore attentyue bee. So I'l be gone. Maltha Renowned kinge in token of the ioy we haue conceiued for that Goliath the Philistian was by Dauid killed before your grace we'l singe &amp; daunce &amp; play upon our instruments in commendation of you both. Saul. So do yt me contents. You play &amp; daunce exceedinge well. Now let me heare you singe, triall to make whether in myne eare your voyces be as pleasinge. Bruna Saul stryken hath a thousand men, &amp; Dauid strooke ten thousand Maltha for wc h gods name be pray'sd who ouer hym did hold his hand Saul. What's this I heare? Ten thousand unto Dauid haue they geuen, &amp; to me but a thousand? This their proportion ys vneuen. What more can they vnto hym geue, sauinge the kingdome only? Both he &amp; you had best be gone, for wt h you I am angry. What are you all gone hence away, &amp; lefte me here alone? If I hym catch I'l hym dispatch. But now I will be gone. Nuncius Since the tyme that the women did commend dauid so highly Saul wt h right eyes neuer on hym lookt, for towards hym hee's angry. Yet not wt h standinge Dauid seekes to geue hym all content he can, &amp; shewes hym selfe to hym both lowly &amp; obedient. And this day he appoynted ys before hym for to play: for wt h the evill spirit he vexed ys as I here say: And here's the place where he appoynted ys hym for to meete &amp; you shall see how frendly they will one an other greete. Where fore a litle longer yet let me craue your attention, for they'l be here wt h out delay: &amp; so I will begone. Saul My mynde greues mee that I must bee from my kingdome deposed. O that I had the villayne here by whom that must be acted. as smale as flesh to pott I would hys carcase teare &amp; rende, &amp; hys lothsome &amp; synnefull soule vnto the diuill sende. I can not choose but frett &amp; fume, &amp; chafe to thinke there on &amp; stampe, &amp; stayre, &amp; teare my heire. But now I'l sett me downe o what sweete melody is this that now me thinkes I heare? The euill spirit from me yt dryuen hath, who's he that's there Dauid? I'l wt h my speare nayle the close to the wall. Dauid I rather will be gone, then any offence geue you att all Saul This second tyme he hath escapt the wc h hath me sore troubled for I see our lord wt h hym ys, &amp; ys from me departed But I will hym from me remoue, &amp; tribune hym ordayne ouer a thousand men: perhaps in warres he may be slayne And to encourage hym the great'st daungers to vnder go I'l tell hym that merob my elder daughter I will bestow on hym in mariage, in hope where of perhaps he'l be the boulder &amp; now I'l go this to performe so to preuent all daunger Nuncius Dauid by Saul now Tribune's made, &amp; saul hath also offered to hym in mariage his elder daughter, &amp; hym also persuaded only to be a valiant man, &amp; valourously to fight the battels of our lord, that he there by might wynne hym credit for Saul sayd in his heart, let not my hands vpon him bee but let the Philisthijms hands vpon hym light. Such was his policy But Dauid vnto hym replyed thus: Saul what am I or what's my life, or kinred of my father, that I should marry thy daughter, &amp; be made the sonne in law vnto the kinge? Dreede soueraigne lord in me yt's to presumptuous a thinge. But in the ende when Merob should to Dauid have bene marryed On Hadriell the Malathite in marriage shee was bestowed. Because Dauid did Michol loue, who was Sauls yonger daughter wc h when Saul heard, he pleased was, &amp; sayd he would bestow her on hym in marrige, to th'ende she might the cause be of his ouerthrow for then he thought the philisthijmes would agaynst hym sooner go wt h all their power, force &amp; might. More ouer Saule did say to Dauid, in two thou shalt be my sonne in law this day. And also Saul his Seruants bade to say to Dauid secretly, Behold wt h thee the king's well pleasd, &amp; all his seruants loue thee where fore yf thou be wyse, be sonne in law vnto ye kinge. where to Dauid replied. That seemes to you but a smale thinge. But I am a poore man, &amp; one that ys of smale ability. that skilleth not quoth [they] for Saul sayth the kinge needes no dowry. He only doth require an hundred of the philisthijms prepuces that due &amp; iust reuenge there might be made of ye kings enemies. And the kings sonne in law to be made gaue Dauid good content. &amp; shortly after he wt h all his band of souldiers went agaynst the philisthijms, &amp; of them he strooke two hundred men &amp; their prepuces brought forth wt h vnto the kinge, &amp; then hee numbred them to hym, to th'ende he might be made his sonne in law And Saul his daughter Michol did in marriage on hym bestow who lou'd hym passinge well. But Saul still fear'd hym more &amp; more though Dauid as obedient was, as he had bene before to Saul, &amp; wyslier did then All the seruants that saul had behaue hym selfe, wc h gott hym loue of them, &amp; famous made. But Ionathas of all other loues hym best, &amp; to his father ofte speakes for hym as kyndly as yf he were his owne Brother. though through the feare Saul hath conceiud he's Dauids deadly enemy &amp; hath hys sonne &amp; seruants charg'd to kill hym wt h out pitty. But what th'euent here of will be yt shall appeare a-none for Ionathas &amp; Dauid comminge are. So I'l be gone. Ionathas. Dauid my dearest frende, my father Saul seeketh to kill thee &amp; so to do he all his seruants charged hath, &amp; mee But to committ that vnkynd act wee loue thee all to well: yet for all that looke to thy selfe, &amp; geue eare to my counsell. To morrow secretly, &amp; in the field be syde my father I'l stand, &amp; what I see or heare vnto thee I'l discouer. Dauid Ionathas freende of all freendes) I am no litle to thee beholdinge. Ionathas Not so: Thou doest deserue all I can do: But let's be goinge Sinne not (o kinge) agaynst Dauid thy true &amp; trusty seruant for he agaynst thee hath not sinn'd: If all his acts were extant they would be iudged good for thee: for he strooke the philistian wt h the daunger of his owne lyfe, wc h Israel credit wanne &amp; thou yt saw, &amp; did reioyce: why there fore dost thou sinne in seekeinge of his innocent blood, who thy safty hath byn? Saul Our lord lyues, he shall not be slayne. my wrath thy words hath pacifyed Ionathas May I then hither Dauid fetch, &amp; you not be offended? Saul. Thou may: but quickely bringe hym then, for longe I can not stay Dauid thou welcome art: my sonne hath made vs frendes to day Dauid Your highnes I do humbly thanke, whom I'l both serue &amp; honour &amp; be indebted to your sonne for his kind loue &amp; fauour. Saul The Philisthijmes haue rays'd agayne a greate &amp; mighty battell where fore thou must forth wt h be gone, &amp; be the guyde of Israell Dauid. What charge (my liege) you do impose on me, I'l vnder goe Saul I thinke no lesse, &amp; you forward to sett I'l be gone also. Nuncius. Dauid amongst the philisthijms hath made a mighty slaughter &amp; when some fewe flede from his face, wt h speede he followed after &amp; when the battell ended was, the euill spirit vexed Kinge Saul agayne, &amp; Dauid on his harp before hym played &amp; Saul intendinge wt h his speare Dauid vnto the wall for to haue nayl'd, he stept asyde, &amp; from the face of Saul departed, &amp; the speare did pearce the wall, Dauid vnwounded &amp; so the lyfe of Dauid was for that tyme also saued. But Dauid's house Saul wt h a garde besett all that same night hym the next morninge to haue kild so soone as yt was light Which when Michol his wyfe heard shee to Dauid told yt sayinge vnlesse thou make escape this night thou must dye the next morninge. Wherefore he through a window caus'd his wyfe to lett hym downe &amp; shee a statua on his bedd did lay, when he was gone. &amp; at the head there of a heiry skynne of goates she layd &amp; couer'd yt wt h clothes, &amp; to the seruants of Saul sayd: My Husband's sicke in bedd. Then in the bedd we will hym carry (quoth they) to Saul. And when that Saul the statua did espy, Michol (quoth he) why mockt thou me, &amp; letten myne enemy flee? Because sayd she, he sayd to me: Let me go or I'l kill thee. And streight to Samuel Dauid went, who did in Ramatha dwell &amp; all that Saul had done to hym to Samuel he did tell: &amp; did there wt h him stay. wc h when Saul heard he seruants sent to fetch hym thence (so furiously he was agaynst hym bent. But when the seruants saw a troup of prophets that did prophecy &amp; Samuel standinge ouer them, Spirit of our lord did presently vpon them come, &amp; they began wt h them also to prophecy: wc h when saul heard, he sent agayne for hym an other company who prophecied also: Then he sent the third, &amp; they did lykewyse. Lastly he went hym selfe, &amp; when he came vnto those countryes the Spirit of our lord came on hym, &amp; goinge he did prophecy till he was into Ramath come, &amp; then he stripped presently off all his clothes, &amp; wt h the rest before Samuel he prophecyed &amp; sange all one whole day &amp; night, &amp; there vpon was raysed an vsuall prouerbe: what ys Saul amongst the prophets also? And Dauid thence departed streight, &amp; to Ionathas did go but of what course they will conclude as yet yt ys not knowne but shortly, for here they cominge are. Now I'l be gone. Dauid Ionathas kynde frende what haue I done? &amp; what ys myne iniquity? agaynst thy father that my lyfe he seekes for to take from me? Ionathas Nay god forbid, thou shall not dye, for agaynst thee my father will not vnlesse he tell me first any thing do great or lesser. Dauid Thy father surely knows that I haue found grace in thy sight &amp; he'l say: let not Ionathas know, lest that perhaps yt might hym sory make, yet neuer the lesse as sure as thy soule lyueth one degree only (as I may so say) me &amp; death parteth. Ionathas What s'euer thou shalt to me say, that will I for thee doe Dauid Behold the kalends are to morrow, &amp; I am vsed to sit downe besyds the kinge to eate: dismisse me that I may my self hyde in the field till the eueninge of the third day. And yf thy father aske for me, say Dauid willed instantly that he at this same tyme might vnto Bethleem go his citty because then solemne victimes vnto all of his tribe bee Yf he say well, I shall fynd peace, but yf that he be angry know that his malice ys complete. This mercy to me do because that the league of our lord ys made betwixt vs two. But kill me thy owne self yf yt there be in me iniquity &amp; bringe me not vnto thy father. Ion[athas]. Dauid be yt farre from me yt cannot be, but I shall tell thee yf that my fathers malice agaynst the be complet: &amp; now I make the faythfull promise that yf of thee my father sharply speake I will immediatly the same to the declare, &amp; thee dismisse: or else vnto mee let god do this &amp; this. And yf I liue thou shalt do mercy to me agayne; but yf I dye, for ay to my posterity, when our lord shall thy enemies haue rooted out of the land Dauid But what thy father sayth of me how shall I vnderstand? Ionathas To morrow hyde thy self by the stone that ys Ezel called &amp; I'l three Arrows shoote, as though I at a marke had roued &amp; to the boy that fetches them, yf I shall say they are on this syde thee come plucke them up, do thou to me repayre because then peace to wardes thee ys, &amp; no yll our lord lyueth. But yf that I shall say vnto the boy, who th'Arrowes fetcheth, Beyonde the th'Arrows are, go thou in peace because our lord hath the dismist: witnes our lord betwixt vs of this word. Dauid Thankes Ionathas: I will not haue thy kyndnes in obliuion Ionathas So I persuade my selfe: But Dauid now let vs begone Nuncius The Kalends now are past, &amp; Saul accordinge to his maner sate in his chayre to eate, &amp; by his syde he placed Abner &amp; Ionathas before hym stoode, &amp; Dauids place was empty &amp; yet the first day Saul no token gaue that he was angry But when the next day came &amp; saul saw Dauid still away Ionathas (quoth he) wherefore's not Dauid here to day nor yesterday? He instantly (sayd Ionathas) desyred for to go to Bethleem there to sacrifice as all his Brethren do who earnestly had for hym sent to come to that solemnity, wc h is the cause my liege that he's now absent from your maestie. wt h to Ionathas Saul did say: O thou sonne of a woman who cunningly &amp; of her owne accorde ravisheth a man know not I that thou dauid loues vnto thyne owne confusion &amp; of thy ignominious mother, for so longe as the sonne of Isai lyues vpon the earth thou shalt not be established in the kingdome, where fore be gone &amp; fetch hym to me presently because he ys the sonne of death, &amp; shall be slayne undoubtedly Why shall he dye Ionathas replyed? father what hath he done? yf that this speare (quoth Saul) will hold I'l make that to the knowne. &amp; wt h that he would hym haue striken, wc h when Ionathas perceiued wt h out delay he did depart away, beinge much offended, &amp; greiued sore for Dauids sake, &amp; in the morninge did go to the fielde, where Dauid was appoynted to lye hydd &amp; there one Arrow shott, &amp; to his boy sayd fetch yt to mee: &amp; ouer hym then shott an other, &amp; sayd boy yt's beyond thee: wc h when the boy had fetcht, he shott the third, &amp; sayd looke further beyonde the boy, go pull yt vp make hast &amp; do not loyter. And when the boy had brought them backe: Ionathas sent hym away wt h them. And Dauid then to Ionathas came wt h out delay. &amp; thrise adored to the ground, &amp; then they kist ech other &amp; did confirme the league betwixt them made to last for euer. Wc h done both of them went their way, Ionathas vnto the citty and Dauid to Achimelech the high priest, who askt hym why he came alone? Because (quoth Dauid) that a word the kinge in secret to me told, &amp; sayd let no man know the thinge. wherefore let me haue some thinge for to eate, for I am hungry. I haue no lay breades (sayd Achimelech) but only bread that's holy wc h are the loaues of proposition, that I will to thee geue &amp; thou may also eate, the in necessity to relieue And when he was refresht he askt Achimelech for a speare or sworde, because I myne owne weapons (quoth he) I haue not here but them behynde me lefte because the kinge me forward hastned. Here's sayd the priest Goliaths sword, where wt h yu hym beheaded vp in a mantell wrapt beyonde the Ephod, wc h yf yt please thee take for here ys no other. There's none lyke that (quoth Dauid) geue't me. And so Achimelech did, &amp; then Dauid from hym departed &amp; went to Achis kinge of Geth, where how he ys receiued you wt h your eyes shall see yf that a while you'l geue attention for here in sight they cominge are: And now I will be gone. Kinge Achis What man ys that whome you bringe there? let me streight vnderstand proclus Is yt dreede soueraigne lord not Dauid the kinge of the land? Did they not in their daunces singe, &amp; say vnto this man? Saul strooke a thousand, &amp; Dauid ten thousand men hath slayne. Kinge Achis Dauid? &amp; ys in such a feare? See how his countenance changeth. He stumbleth as he comes, &amp; downe betwene your hands now slippeth &amp; the spitle downe his beard doth runne. The man ys madde you see thinke you that we do madde men lacke, that you haue brought unto mee this foolish fellow in to my presents the madde man for to play? Shall this man go into my house? No, no, come let's away. Dauid Now they are gone, &amp; my lyfe's sau'd, though in distresse I am no longer here I'l stay, but flee to the caue of Odellam Nuncius Dauids now to Odellam come, wc h when his brethren hearde, they &amp; all in his fathers house forth wt h to hym repar'de, &amp; all such as were in distresse, or wt h any debt oppressed or of a pensyue heart, or troubled mynde to hym resorted &amp; he was made their prince, &amp; had about foure hundred men at his command, &amp; when he had there stayd a whyle, he then to Maspha went: &amp; of the kinge of Moab desyr'd that hee would let his parents wt h hym stay, vntill that god almighty of hym disposed had: &amp; he cousented to his motion &amp; they there wt h hym stay'd so longe as Dauid was in garison, wc h was but a short whyle, for Gad the prophet hym persuaded to Iuda for to go: wc h when saul heard, he streight assembled his seruants, &amp; what he will to them say will streight appeare for now a-longe vnto this place I spye them cominge here.

Doeg I make no doubt there of, wherefore let's now begone. Abiathar Doeg this day eighty fyue priests hath slayne, wc h were reuested in lynnen Ephods, &amp; also hath Nobe their citty waysted &amp; in th'edge of the sword stryken all there in both men &amp; women &amp; spared not so much as suckinge babes &amp; litle children, nor oxe, nor Asse, nor sheepe, but putt them all vnto the sworde &amp; only I escapt amongst all the priests of our lord. To Dauid I'l begone, &amp; vnto hym relate ech thinge. Dauid. Abiathar well mett: what newes I pray the dost thou bringe? Abiathar All the priests of our lord Doeg the Idumite hath slayne Dauid Doeg I wt h Abimalech saw, &amp; thought he would complayne. I guylty am of all their soules, &amp; the soule of thy father Achimelech that good high priest. Stay wt h me, &amp; who s'euer seekes thy lyfe shall seeke myne, &amp; thou wt h me shall be preserued. But now let's hence begone, lest vnawares we be assaulted. Nuncius. When Dauid heard that Ceila was by the philisthijms oppugned he by Abiathar the priest forth wt h our lord consulted whether he should go, &amp; yt relieue: &amp; our lord made hym ausweare he should go, &amp; them also from their enemyes deliuer: wc h he performd, &amp; Saul hearinge there of prepar'd an army, &amp; them commandment gaue for to go &amp; besiege that citty. where of when Dauid had intelligence, he by the priest Abiathar sayd lord will they to Ceila come, as they prepared are, &amp; yf they come, whether will the men of Ceila me deliuer to them, or not? To whom our lord agayne did make this answeare: Saul will come downe, &amp; they of ceila will to hym deliuer thee, &amp; there fore Dauid wt h six hundred men from thence did flee vnto the Desert Ziph &amp; Ionathas toward's hym goinge to comfort hym, as shall appeare, for here they are both cominge. Ionathas Dauid feare not for the hand of my father shall not stryke thee but thou shalt ouer Israel reigne, &amp; I thy second bee: yea &amp; my father knoweth this. where fore my league wt h thee agayne I will confirme, &amp; thy true frende for euer will remayne. Dauid Thankes Ionathas: &amp; to my power I will requite thy curtesy Ionathas I thinke no lesse. Now let's be gone lest that betrayd we bee. Nuncius When that the zephits vnderstoode that Dauid did remayne still in the Desert Ziph, they did of hym to saul complayne sayinge: Dauid lyes hidd wt h vs: yf yt please the o kinge vs to command, wt h out delay we'l hym vnto thee. bringe. Blest be yee of our lord (quoth Saul) because my case you pitty I pray you go in secret wyse, lest he do you espye &amp; all his lurkeinge holes search out, &amp; where he hym selfe hydeth for that I lye in wayte for hym he craftely suspecteth. And bringe me certayne worde there of, &amp; then I'l wt h you go. And they of all thinges brought hym word as he did bidd them do And Saul wt h all his army streight alonge wt h them went on. wc h Dauid heareinge, forth wt h went into the Desert Maon &amp; saul pursued hym so fast, &amp; followed so harde after that Dauids host on th'one syde of a hill was, Sauls on the other. So that Dauid was in dispayre that he could haue escaped from saul, who in the maner of a ringe had hym in vironed But vnto Saul a messenger came, &amp; sayd come out of hand for the philisthijms haue powred out them selues vpon the land. wc h made Saul the pursuite of Dauid for to leaue, &amp; so Dauid escapt his hands, &amp; did into Engaddi go. wc h vnto Saul was told, when he the philisthijms had subdued &amp; wt h three thousand chosen men agayne he Dauid followed ouer the steepe &amp; broken rocks, wc h are accessible only vnto wilde gotes, &amp; in to sheepe coates went, as he past by And what successe by his pursuite he shall haue, yet's not knowne but shortly will, yf you'l expect a while. So I'l be gone. Dauid In th'inner part of this same caue, come let's our selues go hyde for Saul so hotely vs pursues, we can not hym abyde. Saul. Souldiers stay there a while, &amp; I'l returne to you a-none for I'l go ease my self, a busynes that must needes be done, &amp; I can fynd no fitter place then in this caue here by Souldiers to Saul. And here as you appoynted haue, we will expect your maiesty Gobrias. Behold Dauid the Day ys come, where of our lord sayd to thee I will deliuer to thy hands thy foe &amp; mortall enemy that thou mayst do to hym as yt seemes good in thyne owne eyes. Dauid Our lord be mercifull to mee, that I in any wyse do no thinge vnto my maister, who's of our lord annoynted neyther shall there by you any violence to hym be offered: only I haue the Hemme of sauls cloke softly cutt away. wc h greeues my heart, because he ys as I before did say th'annoynted of our lord. But now let's backe returne agayne vnto the caue, &amp; silent be while Saul doth there remayne Saul Now to my Army I'l returne, from whence I came before Dauid My lord, &amp; kinge.

Lo thine eyes see thys day that our lord hath deliuered thee to mee in the caue where I might haue slayne thee, but I thee haue spared &amp; sayd I would not lay my hands vpon our lords annoynted: &amp; for proofe of my words, Hemme of thy cloke here may thou see wc h father I cutt off, &amp; would not lay my hand vpon thee where by thou mayst perceiue that I agaynst the do intend no yll, nor willingly in any wyse would thee offend. Yet for all that thou lyes in wayte my lyfe to take away where as I might thy lyfe haue had, &amp; yet would the not slay. our lord be Iudge betwixt vs two, &amp; me reuenge on thee But on th'annoynted of our lord my hand shall neuer bee.

Who when he found his foe would lett him go agayne away? Our lord reward thee for the mercy thou hast shew'd me to day. And now syth that I know, &amp; certaynly do vnderstande that thou shalt reigne, &amp; Israels kingdome haue vnder thy hand Sweare to me in our lord that thou wilt not the seede anoy that comes of mee, nor the name of my fathers house destroy Dauid Our lord doth lyue, neyther thy seede nor house I'l hurt for euer. Saul Then go in peace. Dau[id]. Now I'l depart to places that are saffer Nuncius Now Samuel's deade, &amp; in his house in Ramatha ys buried where all Israell assembled were together &amp; for hym mourned And since that tyme Dauid to pharan's gone, &amp; there doth dwell a certayne man in Maon whose possession ys in carmell exceedinge greate, who hath three thousand sheepe, &amp; goates a thousand &amp; Nobal ys his name, &amp; vnto Abigail he ys husbande, who was a woman beautifull &amp; wyse but he ys couetous &amp; ouer sparinge of his goods, hard harted, &amp; malicious And vpon his sheepe shearinge day Dauid intends to sende ten men to hym, hym to salute in the name of a frende who neuer hath troubled his flocks, nor any of them taken though they were in the desert kept, neare to hym by his men &amp; in what sort Nabal that couetous wretch will make them answeare attentyue bee &amp; you shall see for they are cominge here Dreido Nabal peace be to thee, &amp; to thy house, &amp; to thy Brethren Nabal Beggers I'l lay my lyfe you are to prate you are so geuen Dreido Our maister Dauid heard this day that you are sheareinge sheepe wc h in the desert your men were wonted by vs to keepe whom hitherto we neuer haue in any wyse molested nor one diminisht of thy flocks, but rather them preserued as thy owne men can witnesse beare.

Nabal Thou may thy prateinge leaue good fellow, for in vayne yu but speakest for I know not who Dauid ys, nor what's the sonne of Isai There's many a seruant from his maister flieth at this day. Shall I then take my bread &amp; water, &amp; the flesh of my cattell that's for my shearers kil'd, &amp; yt bestow I can not tell on whom, nor whence they are? That hath not bin my vsuall fashion wherefore returne from whence you came: Reliefe here you get none. &amp; so vnto your maister say vnlesse that you be maisterlesse. Dreido This is a very hard message to beare to one that's in distresse but syth no better we can gett there wt h we'l be content at this same tyme, &amp; go &amp; cary yt to our lord incontinent Nabal.

Phylach Mistres Dauid sent to my maister messengers in freendly wyse &amp; he them and their message scorn'd, &amp; did Dauid despise where as all our flockes prosper'd well, whyle we wt h them conuersed for as a wall both night &amp; day they vs &amp; them defended. Wherefore mistres consider well what you haue for to do for ruyne to our maister ys in tended &amp; to you. for Dauid hath foure hundred fightinge men agaynst hym raysed besydes two hundred lefte behynd, who wt h their baggage's stayed Abigail Then will I go &amp; take wt h me two hundred loaues of bread wt h muttons, Rasens, figgs &amp; wyne, wc h I'l cause to be carryed vnto Dauid vpon an Asse wt h out my husbands priuity &amp; them forth wt h present to hym wt h words of greate humility Philach Mistres that's your best course: perhaps yt will appease his anger Abigail That ys my trust: come let's begone, for yt's no tyme to loyter I prostrate here beseech my lord that he will not be angry: at Nabals wordes, who did, accordinge to his name, speake foolishly &amp; ys a foole. I thy hand mayd saw not them whom thou sent but so soone as I heard there of, I came incontinent, &amp; brought wt h me a smale remembrance to my lord the kinge hopeinge he'l yt accept because yt ys of my presentinge. who wish all happines &amp; health vnto your royall maiesty &amp; will accompt hym as my foe, that ys to the an enemy.

Abigail. Then will I take my leaue, &amp; rest vnto my lord beholdinge Dauid Abigail adue wt h all my heart. I'l also now be goinge Nuncius When Abigail came home her husband had a feast prouided lyke to a kinge, &amp; he wt h drinke had hym selfe ouercharged Wherefore she told hym not a worde what hapened had till morninge but then disclosed all: where of when he had vnderstandinge his hearte as could grew as a stone, &amp; wt h in ten dayes after he dyed beinge stryken by our lord, who seldome tymes doth suffer synners vnpunished to escape, wc h Dauid vnderstandinge reioyced at his death, &amp; sayd: blest be our lord for punishinge the cause of my reproch hym selfe, &amp; hath his seruant saued from doinge yll. &amp; since his death Dauid to her ys marryed. And he Achinoam of Iesrahel did also marry. But Saul his daughter Michol Dauids wyfe marryed to Phalty Lais his sonne. And now of late the Zephits haue informed Saul that Dauid in ziph lyes hydd, &amp; Saul his host hath camped consistinge of three thousand men out of all Israel chosen, agaynst the Desert, where of intelligence Dauid hath also gotten. But how he can defend hym self, as yet yt ys not knowne but shortly will, yf you will patience haue. so I'l be gone. Dauid Achimelech &amp; Abisai Sauls campe we haue surueyed this night, &amp; that so secretly that we were not espyed &amp; as you saw they sleepinge lye both saul &amp; all his company wt h in their Tents, &amp; soundly to wt h trauelinge beinge weary. Wc h of you will into the campe go downe wt h mee to Saul Abisai That willingly I'l do my lord, befall what may befall Dauid Well then Achimelec backe returne thou to my host incontinent &amp; we'l to Sauls campe go: Lo Abisai they wt h in the tent are all still fast a sleepe, &amp; at sauls head his speare ys fixed fast in the ground, &amp; his cupp full of water by yt is placed Abisai. Yt's true my gratious lord: God to thy hands deliuered hath thy foe: where fore I'l wt h my speare once nayle hym to the earth &amp; that so surely that I shall not neede to stryke hym twice Dauid Thou shalt not Abisai kill my lord the kinge in any wyse for who shall his hand forth extend agaynst our lords annoynted &amp; innocent be? As our lord lyues his dayes shall not be shortned, vnlesse our lord stryke hym hym selfe wt h some disease, or hee in warres fortune for to be slayne, or naturall death do dye. Only his speare &amp; cupp of water that do stand at his head let's take wt h vs. Not one of them at all as yet ys wakened for the dead sleepe of our lord's on them come: But let's away &amp; till we to the Top of the next mountayne come, not stay Abisai yt seemes they sleepe on still. But now beinge out of daunger let's on them call. Awake good people. Abner will thou not answere? Abner Who's he that calls &amp; doth the kinge disquiet? yt ys not well Dauid What Abner art thou not a man? &amp; who's lyke thee in Israel? why then vnto the kinge thy lord no better hast thou looked? for one hym to haue kil'd there was into his tent that entred. You did amisse &amp; worthy are to be putt to the sworde who did no better looke vnto th'annoynted of our lord. Behold where the kings speare ys, &amp; also his cupp of water the wc h were at his head. Lo both of them I fetcht haue hither Saul Is this thy voyce Dauid my sonne? Dau[id]. My voyce my lord &amp; king why doth my liege mee persecute? Haue I done any ill thinge in my lords eyes? If our lord haue the vp agaynst me stirred odor of sacrifice let there bee: yf men, they are accursed in our lords sight, who cast me out for feare lest I should dwell in the inheritance of our lord the god &amp; kinge of Israell Saul I sinned haue, Dauid my sonne returne, for more yll I will not vnto the do, syth my lyfe hath bene preserued by thee Dauid. See here the kings speare ys. let one of the kings seruants passe &amp; fetch the same, for willingly I'l send yt to his grace &amp; our lord will reward ech one accordinge to his iustice for he this day into my hands deliuered thee I wis &amp; I would not stretch out my hand agaynst our lords annoynted &amp; as thy lyfe by mee, so let myne be by thee preserued. Saul Sonne Dauid blest be thou &amp; truly doinge thou shalt do &amp; prevaylinge thou shalt prevayle, &amp; now I'l go in to my place agayne: &amp; where thou art yf thou list thou may stay Dauid All happiness attend my liege. Now he's gone I'l away for my mynde geues me I shall fall one day into Sauls hand: Ys yt not better then to flee into the Philisthijms hand? for then in Israel Saul will not seeke for me any longer &amp; so I may be saffe: yt's my best course, I will go thither Nuncius Dauid hence wt h sixe hundred men did vnto Achis flee the kinge of Geth, who gaue hym leaue to dwell in his owne citty at first wt h all his whole retinew, but after wardes bestowed the citty Siceleg on hym, in wc h he foure monthes stayed &amp; pray'd vpon the enemyes of the kinge, wc h pleas'd hym well for they were neyther subiect to the Philisthijms nor to Israel but such as god commanded had before to be destroyed beinge Chananites of whom neyther mans nor womans lyfe he spared but put them all vnto the sword, wc h was to Achis gratefull &amp; hym occasion gaue agayne to Dauid to be thankfull &amp; to trust hym so well, that hym &amp; his men he will take in to the warres the wc h the philisthijms are about to make agaynst Saul, &amp; the Israelits, &amp; Dauid hath fidelity promised to hym. And Saul lykewyse hath cald to gether Israel who are in campe, &amp; wt h the Philisthijms ready to ioyne battell but who the victory shall gett, yt's hard yet for to say. but tyme will manifest make the same, &amp; so I will away. Saul The Philisthijms campe I haue suruey'd, &amp; yt makes me astonyed. And I consulted haue our lord, &amp; he hath not me answeared neyther by dreames, prophets, nor priests: &amp; dead longe since ys Samuell &amp; all the southsayers, &amp; magicians I haue banisht out of Israell where fore seeke me a woman that a spirit pithonicall hath &amp; I will to her go, &amp; geue eare vnto what shee sayth Philox In Endor there's a woman that hath a pithonicall spirit Saul Thither streight I'l go disguis'd, &amp; see yf I can wt h her meete. &amp; Philox thou &amp; Larmos shall only attend vpon mee Come let's begone, for sore I long vntill I do her see. Philox Here Endor ys my liege, where as the pithonissa dwelleth &amp; now in the night tyme (wc h best of all their science fitteth) she commeth here alone, as her guise ys, out of the citty Saul. Woman well mett: In thy pithonicall spirit diuine vnto mee I thee beseech, &amp; rayse hym vp whom I shall nominate to thee. Pithonissa Thou knows that all the southsayers &amp; magicians expelled bee by Saul out of the land: why then for my life dost thou lye in wayte? Is yt because thou would betray me to the kinge? Saul Our lord lyues there no euill shall happen to thee for this thinge. Pithonissa. Who ys yt that I shall rayse vp to thee? Saul Rayse me vp Samuell Pithonissa. Why hast thou me deceiu'd? for thou art Saul I know right well Saul Be not afray'd. what hast thou seene. Pith[onissa]. Gods out of the earth cominge. Saul What maner of forme hath hee? Pith[onissa]. An olde man ys come vp whose clothinge a mantell ys. Saul. Then ys yt samuel. I'l prostrate hym adore on my face to the very earth. Sam[uel]. Saul let me know where fore thou hast disquieted mee, that I should vp agayne be raysed? Saul I am in great distresse: for the philisthijms are now prepared agaynst me for to fight, &amp; God's away from me departed, &amp; neyther by prophets, priests, nor dreames answeares me beinge consulted &amp; there fore I haue on the cald to th'ende that yu might to me a shew what I shall do. Sam[uel]. Why askest thou when as our lord's gone from the? vnto thy foe? for our lord will (as he by my mouth did tell thee) thy kyngdome from the take, &amp; geue yt vnto Dauid, Because thou heardest not his voyce, nor the wrath of his fury on Amelech did: wherefore all that thou suffers, our lord doth to thee. And to the philisthijms our lord will also deliuer wt h thee Israel vp: &amp; thou &amp; thy sonnes to morrow shall be wt h mee Philox Alas (Larmos) the kinge is fallen, &amp; strecht out on the ground for Samuels wordes frighted hym much: lo no strength's in hym founde haueinge not eate to day. Pith[onissa]. I do perceiue that he's much troubled Behold my gratious lord thy handmayd hath thy voyce obeyed &amp; I into thy hands my lyfe haue put, where fore to mee agayne geue eare, &amp; wt h me go, &amp; meate I'l geue vnto thee. that thou may eate, &amp; strength recouer, &amp; then go on thy iourney. Saul I will not eate. Pith[onissa], Phil[ox], Lar[mos]. But you must needes. Saul. Let's go then syth you force mee. Nuncius So soone as saul had some thinge eaten, he backe agayne returned directly to his army that in Iesrahell was camped. And the Philisthijms to wardes them marcht, &amp; Dauid &amp; his company behynde wt h Achis went: whom when the philisthijms did espye, Their princes vnto Achis sayd: What do these Hebrews meane? Do you (quoth he) not know Dauid Sauls seruant &amp; his men, who many dayes &amp; yeares in Siceleg wt h me hath dwelled &amp; since he from saul fledd to me, he neyuer me deceiued. Lett hym quoth they returne, &amp; not go downe wt h vs to battell lest he our enemy do become, &amp; do take part wt h Israell. for how can he but in our heads his lord &amp; maister pacify? Ys not this Dauid vnto whom they sange in daunces lately? Saul hath a thousand strooke, &amp; Dauid stricken hath ten thousand. And Achis what the princes sayd told Dauid out of hand sayinge to hym: I euer found thee iust since thou came to mee, but the princes of thee dislyke, where fore go backe I pray thee, because they will not thee permitt to go wt h them to battell although thou euer hast bene iust in my sight as gods Angell Through whose persuation Dauid backe to Siceleg returned &amp; by th'Amelecits found the citty cleane vnto ashes burned And the women led captyues away from the lesse to the greatter amongst wc h were Dauids two wyues, wc h made hym his cheekes water for griefe, &amp; he by our lords warrant did th'enemyes pursue &amp; tooke from them his wyues, &amp; pray, &amp; most part of them slewe. And shortly after this the Philisthijms did fight wt h Israel, &amp; Israell fled before their face, &amp; in mount Gelboe fell: In the wc h conflict Saul hym self, beinge by th'Archers sore wounded sayd vnto his Esquier, lest that perhaps th'vncircumcised come and kill me wt h scoffes, draw out thy sword, &amp; there wt h strike mee: But his Esquier beinge frighted sore would not: where fore Saul presently his sword caught, &amp; vpon yt fell, &amp; his lyfe streight departed wc h his Esquier seeinge also fell vpon his sword &amp; dyed. Sauls three sonnes also, &amp; all his men were slayne that day together. wc h newes beinge vnto Dauid brought returninge from the slaughter of Amelech, hee &amp; all his men their garments rent, &amp; mourned &amp; wept, &amp; vntill that yt eueninge was, they also fasted vpon Saul &amp; Ionathas his sonne, &amp; vpon all the people of our lord &amp; the house of Israell that were slayne in the battell. But Ionathas death of all the rest Dauid lamented bitterly sayinge: for thee my brother Ionathas I am exceedinge sorry. Euen as the mother her only sonne doth loue, so I thee loued shewinge there by that death his loue towards hym had not ended. And what course Dauid now will take, as yet yt ys not knowne but shortly will yf you will patience haue. So I'l be gone.</field>
