      <field name="fulltext">MIDAS; AN English Burletta.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the READER. The Editor of the following piece thinks proper to observe, that the first idea of it was conceived, and the plan in some measure executed by a gentleman in Dublin, for the private entertainment of some persons of distinction in that kingdom, at a time, when Italian Burlettas were blended with the exhibitions of the Theatre, and almost triumphed over the best productions in our language. The public spirit of those, for whom it was originally intended, prevailed upon the author to enlarge his design. Accordingly, Midas adventured on the stage, and met with uncommon success for a series of nights. The Editor begs leave to add a word concerning the stile which prevails in the following scenes. They are written in the true spirit of the mock-heroic. Burlesque, in all times, from the stage of Athens down to the Dragon of Wantley, has been esteemed one of the provinces of the Drama. It's humour principally consists in making dignified personages raise in our minds trite and ordinary ideas, or else in giving to trivial objects a serious air of gravity and importance. It would be impertinent to point out instances in either way of composition; but thus much was deemed necessary that no one should look for another sort of entertainment than was here intended. The public, with their usual candour, will consider the particular scope of this piece, and will decide nothing till they have heard the musick, to which it is adapted. Should Midas in the representation be found to have merit, and indeed, excellence in its kind; the generous critick will allow the author that degree of applause, which his talents seem to deserve.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. The curtain rising discovers the Heathen Deities, seated amidst the clouds, in full council: they address Jupiter in chorus, accompanied by all the instruments. AIR I. King of Prussia's March. Chorus of all the Gods. Jove, in his chair, Of the sky Lord-May'r With his nods Men and Gods Keeps in awe, When he winks Heaven shrinks, When he speaks Hell squeaks Earth's globe is but his taw. Cock of the school He bears despotic rule, His word Tho' absurd Must be law. Even fate Tho' so great, Must not prate, His bald pate Jove would cuff, He's so bluff, For a straw. Cow'd deities Like mice, in cheese To stir must cease, Nor gnaw. RECITATIVE, accompanied. Jup. (rising.) Immortals, you have heard your plaintive sovereign And Culprit Sol's high crimes. Shall we who govern Brook spies upon us? Shall Apollo trample On our commands? we'll make him an example. As for you, Juno, curb your prying temper, or We'll make you to your cost, know,âwe're your emperor, Your husbandâwhen the jealous Gad-bee twitches, Swallow your spittleâJove will wear the breeches. AIR II. To its own tune. To happy ignorance Connubial peace is owing: 'Tis a curse to be too knowing Best let things take their chance. A busy curiosity Produces endless evils, It turns the Gods felicity To sharpest pangs of devils, Supplying food to jealousy. RECITATIVE. Juno (aside.) What new rape is toward? To sixes and sevens, This tyrant, for it's sake, will jumble the heavens. I'll take the law. (to Jup.) My proctor, with a summons Shall cite you, sir, t'appear at Doctor's Commons. Jup. Let himâbut first I'll chase from Heaven yon varlet, Juno. What, for detecting you and your vile harlot? Fine scheme! banish the Sun! drive out Apollo! That you, of lawless love, deep draughts may swallow. You'll then not need, thou grand monarque of Horners, Skulk with your misses into holes and corners. AIR III. Shaan Bwee. Think not lewd Jove Thus to wrong my chaste love, For spite of your rakehelly godhead By day, and by night, Juno will have her right Nor be, of dues nuptial, defrauded. I'll ferrit the haunts Of your female gallants. In vain you in darkness enclose them, Your favourite jades, I'll plunge to the shades, Or into cows metamorphose them. RECITATIVE. Jup. Peace termagant, I swear by Styxâour thunder Shall hurl him to the earth. Momus. Sire, we knock under. Ha, ha, ha, (Aside) O jest most precious! 'Twill serve a thousand years hence to refresh us. I say, down with him, Joveâexert your puissance, Morbleu, the puppy's grown a public nuisance, Ay, ay, short workâput out the light, and thenâ AIR V. There was a jovial Beggar. No difference of character, Vice, virtueâidle dreams! For lewd, or chaste, or foul, or fair, Must then be only names, When a sporting all may go, may go, may go, &amp;c. Screen'd from the husband's jealous eyes, All love, all free as air, No wanton need to fear surprize Oh what a life were there! When a sporting, &amp;c. Then hey for trumps, for matadores And rare sansprendre voles, Old maids will fly, when past amours, To dear quadrille by shoals, And a gambling, &amp;c. RECITATIVE. Jove. O brave, we nod his doom! Apollo. Hold, hold, have patience PapaâNo bowels for your own relations! RECIT. accompanied. What can this hurly-burly, this helter-skelter mean? Jove looks confounded surly!âChaos is come again. AIR VI. To it's own tune. Be by your friends advised, Too harsh, too hasty dad! Maugre your bolts, and wise head, The world will think you mad. What worse can Bacchus teach men, His roaring bucks, when drunk, Then break the lamps, beat watchmen And stagger to some punk. RECITATIVE. Jup. You saucy scoundrelâthere sirâcome Disorder, Down PhÅbus, down to earth, we'll hear no farther. RECIT. accompanied. Roll, thunders, roll, blue lightnings flash around him, The blab shall find our sky can do without him. Thunder and lightning. Jupiter darts a bolt at him, he falls.âJupiter re-assumes his throne, and theGods all ascend together, singing the initial chorus. Jove in his chair, &amp;c. A Champaign country with a distant village; violent storm of thunder and lightning. Shepherds sleeping in the field, are rouzed by it and run away frighted. One leaves his cloak, hat, and guittar behind him. Apollo is seen whirling in the air, as cast from heav'n; he falls to earth, with a rude shock, and lies for a while, stunn'd: at length he begins to move, rises, advances, and looking upward, speaks. RECIT. accompanied. Apol. Zooks! what a crush! a pretty decent tumble! Kind usage, Mr. Joveâsweet sirâyour humble. Well, down, I am;âno bones brokeâtho' sorely pepper'd! Here doom'd to stay.âWhat can I do?âturn shepherd. [Puts on the cloak, &amp;c. A lucky thought.âIn this disguise, Apollo No more but Pol, the swain, some flock I'll follow. Nor doubt I, with my voice, guittar, and person, Among the nymphs to kick up some diversion. AIR VII. Hang me if I marry. With fun, my disgrace I'll parry While here on earth, I tarry, With the nymphs, in my way, I'll kiss and play, But hang me if I marryâhang me if I marry With the nymphs, &amp;c. Let the sky go to wreck, and miscarry, Without my luminary, Pol here will stay, To kiss and play To toy, but never marryâtoy, but never marry. Pol here will stay, &amp;c. &amp;c. Enter SILENO. RECITATIVE. Sileno. Whom have we here! a sightly clown!âand sturdy! Humâplays, I see, upon the hurdy-gurdy. Seems out of placeâa stranger,âall in tatters, I'll hire himâhe'll divert my wife and daughters. âWhence, and what art thou boy? Pol. An orphan lad, Sir; Pol is my name;âa shepherd once my dad, Sir; I'th upper parts hereâtho' not born to serving. I'll now take on, for, faith, I'm almost starving. Selino. You've drawn a prize i'th'lottery.âSo have I too; Why,âI'm the master you could best apply to. AIR VIII. To it's own tune. Since you mean to hire for service Come with me, you jolly dog, You can help to bring home harvest, Tend the sheep, and feed the hog. Fa la la. With three crowns, your standing wages, You shall daintily be fed; Bacon, beans, salt beef and cabbage, Butter, milk, and oaten-bread. Fa la la. Come strike hands, you'll live in clover, When we get you once at home, And when daily labour's over We'll all dance to your strum, strum. Fa la la. RECITATIVE. Pol. (aside). From Nectar, and Ambrosia, 'tis coarse diet; When I was well, why could I not be quiet. (After a pause takes Sileno by the hand and sings to the foregoing air.) Done, strike hands, I take your offer, Farther on, I may fare worse, Zooks, I can no longer suffer, Hungry guts, and empty purse. Fa la la. DUETTO. Air continued. Sil. Do, strike hands; 'tis kind I offer, Pol. I strike hands, and take your offer, Sil. Farther seeking you'll fare worse, Pol. Farther on I may fare worse, Sil. Pity such a lad, should suffer, Pol. Zooks, I can no longer suffer, Sil. Hungry guts, and empty purse. Pol. Hungry guts, and empty purse. Fa la la Exeunt, dancing, and singing the chorus. SILENO's Farm-House. Daphne and Nysa, discover'd running,âtheir spinning-wheels over turned. Both. Ha, ha, ha! Daph. But Nysa, how goes on squire Midas' courtship? Nys. Your sweet DamÃ¦tas, pimp to his great worship Brought me from him a purse;âbut the conditionsâ âI've cur'd him, I believe, of such commissions. Daph. The moon-calf! this must blast him with my father. Nys. Right. So we'er rid of the two frights together. AIR IX. If 'tis joy to wound a Lover. If the swain we sigh for press us, Oh how pleasing 'tis to please! If the fright we loath address us How delightful 'tis to teize. RECITATIVE. Daph. Arch Monkey, hang me if I thought 'twas in you. Well Nyâwork you your Squireâas for my Ninnyâ If he shan't curseâthen call me driv'ling Gipseyâ The hour that first on Daph he cast a sheep's eye. AIR X. Mirleton. If I cannot plague the lubber, Now I have him in my crib, If, when he begins to blubber, I can't soothe or laugh, or fib, Doom'd for life, I may be, To play with my baby, And to wear a slabb'ring bib. Both. Ha! ha! ha!âHa! ha! ha! Mysis enters hastily. RECITATIVE, Mys. Hey-day! what mare's nest's found?âFor ever grinning: Ye rantipolesâis't thus you mind your spinning. AIR XI. Three Sheep-skins. Girls are known To mischief prone; If ever they be idle, Who would rear Two daughters fair, Must hold a steady bridle: For here they skip, And there they trip, And this and that way sidle. For here they skip, &amp;c. Giddy Maids, Poor silly jades, All after men are gadding; They flirt Pall mall, Their train to swell, To coxcomb, coxcomb adding To ev'ry fop They're Cock-a-hoop, And set their mother's madding. To ev'ry fop, &amp;c. Enter Sileno introducing Pol. RECITATIVE. Sil. Now, dame, and girls, no more let's hear you grumble At too hard toil:âI chanc'd, just now, to stumble, On this stout drudge,âand hir'd himâfit for labour. To'm ladâthen he can play and sing and caper. Mys. He shall not stayâunknown to me to hire him, A lath! Sil. Nay there you're out,âno toil can tire him: Mys. (putting Pol. from Daph.) Gad's me! your distance, scare-crow! cursed civil! Beggars once mounted, gallop to the devil. Gaffer, (to Sil.) your blunders every hour surprize one: This washy clout a drudge!âah, thou'rt a wise one. Fine rubbish to bring home, a strolling thrummer! (to Pol.) What are thou good for? speak, thou ragged mummer. Nys. Mother, for shameâ Mys. Peace, saucebox, or I'll maul you. Pol. Goody, my strength and parts you under value. For his and your work, I am brisk and handy. Daph. A sad cheat elseâ Mys. What you, you jacka-dandy. Pol. (aside) Our Gammer, sure, has tipt her whet of stingo! Am I Apollo, and must bear this lingo? AIR XII. A tune in Queen Mab. Pray goody, please to moderate the rancour of your tongue: Why flash those sparks of fury from your eyes? Remember, when the judgement's weak, the prejudice is strong. A stranger why will you despise? Ply me Try me Prove, e'er you deny me, If you cast me Off, you blast me Never more to rise. Pray, goody, please, &amp;c. RECITATIVE. Mys. Sirrah, this insolence deserves a drubbing. Nys. With what sweet temper he bears all her snubbing (aside) Sil.

Ay, Pol, the hind, puts out of joint our noses. AIR XIV. Fanny's fairer than a flower. Wretched he, whose pain or pleasure Hangs on faithless woman's mind; Such the merchant's state, whose treasure Swims the sport of tide and wind. Female likings are unsteady As the veering weather-cock. Miss, for new addresses ready Shifts her lover, like her smock. RECITATIVE. Mid. I've heard of that Pol's tricks,âof his sly tampering To fling poor Pan, but I'll soon send him scampering. An upstart!ârival me!âby George, I'll pheaze him. Dam. Sir, he bewitches every girl that sees him. Mid. 'Sblood, I'll commit himâdrive him to the gallows! Where is old Pan? Dam. Tipling, Sir, at th'ale-house. Mid. Run, fetch himâwe shall hit on some expedientâ To rout this Pol. Dam. I fly, (going returns) Sir, your obedient. (Exit. RECIT. accompanied. Mid. What boots my being Squire Justice of Peace, and Quorum? Church-wardenâknight o'th'shire, And Custos Rotulorum? If saucy little Nysa's heart rebellious, My squireship slights, and hanckers after fellows? AIR XV. To a French tune, A la SantÃ© du Pere d'Oleron. Shall a paltry clown, not fit to wipe my shoes Dare my amours to cross? Shall a peasant minx, when justice Midas wooes Her nose up at him toss? No, I'll kidnapâthen possess her. I'll sell her Pol a slave, get mundungus in exchange, So glut to the height of pleasure, My love and my revenge. No, I'll kidnap, &amp;c. Exit. SCENE An Alehouse.

Juno rates him And grates him, And leads his highness a weary life; I have my lass And my glass, And strole a batchelor's merry life. Let him fluster And bluster, Yet cringe to his harridan's furbella; To my fair tulips I glew lips, And clink the cannikin here below. Jupiter wenches, &amp;c. Enter DAMÃTAS. RECITATIVE. Dam. There sits the old soakerâhis pate troubling little How the world wagsâso he gets drink and vittle: Hoa, master Pan!âGad you've trod on a thistle! You may pack up your all, sir, and go whistle.

O blood, and guts! What, dare the tinkler scurvy Intrude, to turn my wenches topsy turvy? A fop! chouse me out of my choice trol-lops, I'll smash his trim guittarâabout his chaps. AIR XVIII. My wife's a galloping, &amp;c. Shall he run away with the lasses By his trills, and his slurs, and his graces, From me who at fairs, and horse-races, Have pip'd to the laird of the clan. A fribble!âIf I can but catch him I'll pummelâI'll pinch, and I'll scratch him, I warrant I'll make him not match him Self as a musician with Pan. RECITATIVE. Dam. Keep yourself cool, good master Panâthis courage Is thrown awayâPol's a mere chip in Porridge; Softly and fairâ Pan. You're right;âour Squire, when mellow, 'Tis he shall do'tâhe's a rough, hect'ring fellow. Dam. Why he sent me for youâHe, with kicks o'th'crupper, Will make Pol danceâHe'll gi'n salt eel to's supper. Pan. Step you beforeâI'll but just pay my reck'ning And in a crack attend his worship's beck'ning. [Exit Dam. [He throws some pieces on the table, and departing is met by MYSIS, entering hastily. Mys. O Pan! the devil to payâboth my sluts frantic! Both in their tantrums, for yon cap'ring antick. Rivals forsooth! Pan. What, for a straggling goatherd! Mys. For this fine piece of workâthanks to my dotard. AIR XIX. Sheelagh na Guiragh. Sure I shall run with vexation distracted, To see my purposes thus counter-acted! This way, or that way, or which way soever, All things run contrary to my endeavour. Daughters projecting Their ruin and shame, Fathers neglecting The care of their fame, Nursing in bosom a treacherous viper; Here's a fine danceâbut 'tis he pays the piper. RECITATIVE. [Mys.] But I'll go seek 'em allâand if I find 'em, I'll drive 'emâas if Old Nick were behind 'em. [Going Pan. Soa, soa,âdon't flounce; Avastâdisguise your fury. Pol we shall trounce. Midas is judge and jury. AIR XX. Tune, Planxty Johnston. When at your foe A mortal blow You aim, Your scheme Let him not know. To gain your end You must pretend, Sincerely And dearly, To be his friend, 'Till he cease of your love to be doubtful. Your game to play, The sailors say Look one, but row another way. The dean, to fish up Lawn sleeves, and be bishop Says no, to the mitre that would fill his wish up. And pussey Can counterfeit sleeping, When mousey Steals tip-a-toe creeping; Then winking, And blinking, She catches, Dispatches, And swallows him up at a mouthful. RECITATIVE. Mys. Out on't, I'll act above-boardâI'll ne'er flatter, Not IâI scorn itâtell me no such matter. My gossips all would loll their tongues, To see me with my vengeance trifle. Pan. Ay, but to pay him home those wrongs, Your transports you must stifle. Mys. Stifle!âdye first! shall Mysis stoop to crawling! Noâby my willâthese hands should stretch him sprawling. Pan.

Check this clutter: Hustâdon't utter Threats, or mutter. If he trips, Success attend ye Fair words butter No parsnips. Mys. Grov'ling spirit! I can't bear it. Can a mother, Without pother Her rage smother When girls both are By his wiles Debauch'd, or near it; Can she cloath her Face with smiles. Pan. Spite loquacious Makes foes cautious. Mys. Mean submission Meets derision. Pan. Beldam froward! Mys. Sneaking coward! [Pan. and Mys.] In surprize/I despise The triumph lies./Such low disguise. Ribornello, [Together] [Pan. and Mys.] Nay let's trick him,/Zooks, I'll twinge him, Sooth, then hick him./I'll unhinge him. Wait,/Tumult, splutter, Wait,/Coil, and clutter.

O ho'! is it soâMiss Daphne in the dumps, Mumâsnugs the wordâI'll lead her such a dance Shall make her stir her stumps. To all her secret haunts, Like her shadow, I'll follow and watch her: And, faith, mamma shall hear on't if I catch her. AIR III. From tree to tree. To blast a rival's happiness We ev'ry art employ: And scarcely can our own success, Convey a purer joy.

La! how my heart goes pit-a-pat! what thumping E'er since my father brought us home this bumpkin. Heigho!âheigho!âyet why Mope thus and sigh? Has not the fellow eyes as well as I?

To a French tune, Quand on Scait aimer et plair. He's as tight a lad to see to, As e'er stept in leather shoe And, what's better, he'll love me too, And to him I'll prove true blue. Tho' my sister casts a Hawk's eye I defy what she can do. He o'er looked the little Doxy, I'm the girl he means to woo. He's as tight, &amp;c.

Sir; you're such an oglio, Of perfection in folio, No damsel can resist you: Your face so attractive, Limbs so supple and active, That by this light, At the first sight, I could have run and kiss'd you. AIR VI. The priest in his boots. If you can caper, as well as you modulate, With the addition of that pretty face, Pan, who was held by our shepherds a God o'late; Will be kick'd out, and you set in his place.

Midas appears now twenty times more hideous Ah, Nysa, what resource?âa cloyster. Death aliveâyet thither must I run, And turn nun.

Baits and fetches, To bewitch us: When you've won us And undone us, Cloy'd you shun us Frowning on us For our easy cooing. Can your palace, plate or coach, Can your diamonds glitt'ring Bridle the tongue of foul reproach? Gibers will be titt'ring.

Yes; your wealth I hold at nought, Daphne's heart shall ne'er be bought; Ne'er to church haste Basely purchas'd By a rich ninny; Who, to keep her chaste, Would lock her up like his guinea. In your pain my pleasure is, Jealous dolt, I hate your phiz, Hissing gander My Philander Scorns your aspersion; Pitiful slander Renders you more my aversion. [Exit. RECITATIVE. Dam.

No March-hare madder, Do, lambkin give it vent,â'twill ease you; And make your heart the gladder. AIR XVII. When that I was a little tiny Boy. When gathering clouds obscure the sky With a crish, crash, Flish and flash, The thunders rowl, and the lightnings fly; Then rainâand all is lullaby. So when a vixen's passions swell Tongue all ire, Eyes on fire, Bosom rent by fiends of hell, At length tears streamâand all is well. RECITATIVE. Mys. Well!âI'll be even with that spark yet.

His means!âwhat nonsense!â But I've a plot shall make you rue, And keep the house too hot for you; Don't be surpriz'd, if on the sudden, Your minion give the crow a pudding Soon mounted in the air, if You chance to see the cudden A caper cut before the sheriff. AIR XVIII. To an Italian Opera tune. The wolf that slaughter'd finds her whelps, With howlings fills the forest, Their murtherer tracks with shrillest yelps, All food neglecting or rest.

Tut, they shall find I ken 'em, And on themselves can turn their venom, [Exit. Pol. Poor fools! how weak, how shallow Are all your plots against Apollo. These clowns I pityâbut my spleen 'twill pamper Midas and Pan to hamper, Their projects to quash And their pride to abash, When all my rays burst on them with one flash. How I shall laugh, when huddled in a cluster, They stare, gaping like stuck pigs at my lustre. AIR XIX. When Faries dance round on the grass. When fairies dance round on the grass And revel to night's awful noon, Each elf with his tight little lass Trips to the pale light of the moon, If't chance that the grey dawn of day Peep in on their frolicks too soon, In fright they all scuttle away, And follow the glimpse of the moon.

Ay go dangle/I could mangle. [Nys., Pol.] Oh how I burn!/Don't suspect me, Yes, to Tyburn,/Or reject me. Daph. What heart without shedding a tear, Nys. I'd escort you with pleasure my dear, Pol. What gallows so bad as despair. Why won't you believe me, Daph. You want to deceive me. Nys. Your falshood shall ne'er again grieve me. Pol. Take my word, and my oath, [Daph., Nys.] You fool us/We'll shew you Cajole us,/We know you Pol. Believe me That at night I will satisfy both. That at night I will satisfy both. [Daph., Nys.] How, will you at night satisfy both?/No, you never can satisfy both. [Exeunt severally. Dance of Nymphs and Swains. End of the Second Act.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. During the symphony, Mercury descends, and walks to and fro, tolling a bell, at intervals, as a public cryer; at the close, in broken air, he publishes the following advertisements. AIR I. Merc. O yes, O yes, O yes, this is to give notice. Lost, or mislaid Or stol'n, or stray'd, From the regions over head, Or reel'd down to earth, when maudlin, A finical Coxcombical Pert, smock-fac'd, young godling; He deals In spells, And fortunes tells, Goes snacks With quacks, And trades With jades, Prying Spying, Pratt'ling Tatt'ling Up stairs, down stairs ratt'ling. His carotty locks As red as a fox; As a switch tall and thin Ne'er a rag to his skin, And answers to the name of Apollo. Enter Pol. RECITATIVE. Pol. Hush ribald cur, this bawling Unless you wish a mawling! Heaven's, what a sink of slander your foul throat is! Mer. Oh are you there, master Apollo? My elbow itch'd; I guess'd at what would follow. Pol. Sirrah, you are a rogue beneath my notice. AIR II. Kiss me fast my mother's coming. Fine times, when each little Pimping, upstart court lick-spittle Worth disgrac'd dares hack and whittle Shafts of malice throwing. See the game cock's crest with mud upon't; Strait the dunghill breed grows proud upon't, Each bare beak It's spleen will wreak, All clapping wings, and crowing. RECITATIVE. Mer. Come come, let's buss, and friends. Pol. Not 'till I curry your mungril hide. Merc. Poo, let's shake hands, my hurry Barr'd compliments.âPray, pray, 'twas jokeâI'm sorry. Jove's in a raging fume, a pelting chafe! Oh! 'tis such fun, would make even Pluto laugh! Pol. Do, let me know't.âI long, for his late kindness To have him on the hip. Merc. Hark then.âHis highness, Safe as he thought himself from your inquires, Sruck up an assignation with Miss Iris: Juno o'er heard it allâ Pol. So had them track'd, I do suppose, and caught them in the fact. Merc. Ah, madam's an old hand:âshe better judging, Lock'd Iris up, and slipt into her lodging; Lay snugâfar'd wellâne'er cried, roast meat, but chuckled, While old Twangdillo dub'd himself a cuckold. AIR III. Nancy Dawson. The Gods were all call'd in to see How fond a husband Jove could be: He storm'd; she laughed, yet, rouguishly Pretended to conceal it. His fury rose to such a pitch, He call'd her lewd, case-harden'd witch, Swore, to his girls he'd stick like pitch, And wench in open day-light. RECITATIVE. Pol. Oh I shall burst!âa pious resolution! Means he to put it strait in execution? Merc. Now, now; your pardon's sign'd; on double wages You're to light up, and run, your usual stages: So mount your box, old geeho, I advise you Resume your task diurnal, He threatens t'advertise you In every weekly Journal. Pol. Well, I've a wench, or twoâyou understand meâ And a drole counter plot some knaves to catch, Which in a trice, I will dispatch, And then he may command me. AIR IV. DUETTO. Pol. A monarch may huff, A senate may rage In edicts too bluff, In speeches so sage! The minister glib While he gives himself Thinks how he may crib For his private affairs. Merc. These fatal mistakes Call aloud for redress; Consider few rakes Would their own ribs caress. A wife in the dark Only squanders her charms, Who, 'stead of her spark, Finds her spouse in her arms. Pol. But I'll display And soon set to rights In open day Such unfair bites. Cuckolds then will know their friends, And, in like coin may make amends. Merc. When our great sir, shall Once fix the mode, Horns universal Will spread abroad, And cuckoo that word of fear, Familiar grow to marry'd ear. Pol and Mercury together. Pol. But I'll display Merc. When our great sir Pol. And soon set to rights Merc. Shall one fix the mode Pol. In open day Merc. Horns univer- Pol. Such unfair bites Mer. âSal will spread abroad Pol. Cuckolds then will know their friends Merc. And cuckoo that word of fear, Pol. And, in like coin may make amends Merc. Familiar grow, to marry'd ear. Mercury re-ascends, and Pol Exit. SCENE Midas's Parlour. Midas, Mysis, and Pan, discovered in consultation over a large bowl of punch, pipes and tobacco. RECITATIVE. Mid. Come, Pan, your toast.â Pan. Here goes, our noble Umpire, Mys. And Pol's defeatâI'll pledge it in a bumper. Mid. Hang him, in every scheme that whelp has cross'd us. Mys. Sure he's the devil himself Pan. Or doctor Faustus. Mys. Ah! Squireâfor Pan wou'd you but stoutly stickle, This Pol would soon be in a wretched pickle. Pan. You reason rightâ Mid. His toby I shall tickle Mys. Look, Squire, I've sold my butter, here it's price is At your command, do but this jobb for Mysis. Count 'em.âSix guineas and an old jacobus Keep Pan, and shame that scape-grace coram nobus. AIR V. Baaltiorough. Mark what I say, you'll repent if Conscience's qualms you attend to; You a great shire's representative And not one job for a friend do? Rouze up, nor thus your grave noddle shake, Fob off this tatterdemallion, We'll stick to Pan, his party take, For Pol's a paltry rascallion. RECITATIVE. Pan. (aside) The justice in quandary!âGad, we have him.â Gammer, Pol's pipe is out; brandy can't save him. Mid. Goody, as 'tis your request, I pocket this here stuff, And, as for that there peasant, Trust me, I'll work his buff. At the musical struggle I'll bully and juggle, My award's Your sure card, Blood, he shall fly his countryâthat's enough. AIR VI. To its own Tune. If in the courts your suit depend, Or a cause you'd fain do hurt in, Be sure you make the judge your friend By a tip behind the curtain. Then decree goes Plump against your foes, Tho' before it seem'd uncertain. RECITATIVE. Pan. Well said, my lad of waxâsince you're so mettled I'll have one tryal with this fopâthat's settled. A word i'your earâYou'll find it no hard matter, When she'as lost Pol, to nab our crony's daughter. AIR VII. Ligurum Cuss. As soon as her doating piece fairly is sped, Do you make your push, and a stout one: For now she has got a sweetheart in her head, She'll never be easy without one; Rever'd by the shepherds, caress'd by the nymphs, No dread or remorse shall come o'er us, At sessions, in spite of the law and its imps, We'll kick the whole country before us. RECITATIVE. Mid. Ha! ha! sit down, and make an end o'th'tankard, I have no head for business till I've drank hard. Pan. Nor have my brains guts in them till they're addle, When I'm most rocky I best sit my saddle. Mys. I always chuck a priming at the tap, or A cogue of Nantzy, just to oil my clapper. Mid. Well come, let's take one bouze, and roar a catch, Then part to our affairs.â Pan. A match. Mys. A catch. AIR VIII. A Catch. Cold and Raw. Mid. Master Pol And his toll-de roll-loll, I'll buffet away from our plain, sir; Pan. And I'll assist Your worship's fist With all my might and main, sir; Mys. And I'll have a thump, Tho' he is so plump, And makes such a woundy racket. Mid. I'll bluff, Pan. I'll rough, Mys. I'll huff, Mid. I'll cuff, Omn. And I warrant we pepper his jackett. Cho. I'll bluff, &amp;c. Mid. For all his cheats And wenching feats He shall rue on his knees 'em, Or skip, by goles, As high as Paul's, Like ugly witch on besom; Arraign'd he shall be Of treason to me! Pan. And I with my davy will back it; I'll swear, Mid. I'll snare, Mys. I'll tear. Omn. O rare! And I'll warrant we pepper his jacket. Chor. I'll swear, I'll snare, &amp;c. [Exeunt.] SCENE Discovers Sileno and DamÃ¦tas in warm argument, on the lawn before Midas's house. RECITATIVE. Sil. My Daphne a wife for thee! the squire's base Pandar! To the plantations sooner would I send her. Dam. Sir, your good wife approv'd my offers. Sil. Name her not, Hag of Endor, What knew she of thee but by thy coffers? Dam. And shall this ditch-born whelp, this jackanapes. By dint of congees and scrapesâ Sil. These are thy slanders and that canker'd hag's.â Dam. A thing made up of pilfer'd ragsâ Sil. Richer than thou with all thy brags Of flocks, and herds, and money bags. AIR X. DUETTO. [Sil.] If a rival thy character draw In perfection he'll find out a flaw, With black he will paint Make a devil of a saint And change to an Owl a Maccaw. Dam. Can a father pretend to be wise Who his friend's good advice will despise? Who, when danger is nigh, Throws his spectacles by And blinks thro' a green girl's eyes? Sil.

Mother, sure you never Will endeavour To dissever From my favour So sweet a swain! None so clever E'er trod the plain. Nys. Father, hopes you gave her, Don't deceive her; Can you leave her Sunk for ever In pining care, Haste and save her From black despair. Daph. Think of his charming grace His voice, shape, and face; Nys. Hearts alarming; Daph. Bosoms warming With his soft lay: Nys. He's so charming Ah, let him stay. Both. He's so charming, &amp;c. Mys.

Now I'm seated I'll be treated, Like the sophi on his throne In my presence Scoundrel peasants, Shall not call their souls their own.

By jingo, well perform'd for one of his age; How, hang dog, don't you blush to shew your visage? Pol. Why, master Midas, for that matter, 'Tis enough to dash one, To hear the arbitrator, In such unseemly fashion One of the candidates bespatter With so much partial passion. [Midas falls asleep. AIR XV. Ah, happy hours, how fleeting Ye danc'd on down away; When my soft vows repeating At Daphne's feet I lay.

See triumphant sits the bard Crown'd with bays, his due reward. Exil'd Pol shall wander far, Exil'd twang his faint guittar, While, with ecchoing shouts of praise We the bagpipe's glory raise. RECITATIVE. Mid. 'Tis well!âwhat keeps you hereâyou ragamuffin? Go trudgeâor do you wait for a good cuffing? RECIT. accompanied. Pol.
