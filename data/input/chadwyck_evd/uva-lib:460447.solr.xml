      <field name="fulltext">WRITTEN IN MDCCLXV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Valdemar King of Norway. Canute King of Denmark. Asmond Prince of Denmark. Lother Son of Asmond. Ostan Danish Chief. Berino Danish Chief. Lina Queen of Norway. Avilda Princess of Denmark. Heralds, Officers, Soldiers, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. An Apartment in Canute's Palace. Canute. âLet the sword sleep, and the grim-visag'd war âIn iron bondage restââso clos'd the strain That told my triumphs o'er the vanquish'd host Of EricâBut the martial star, that rules The fate of Denmark's Kings, to glorious toil Devotes their lives, and bids them close in blood. âThen, farewell peace! Farewell the flattering wish, That Nature, wearied with the weight of years, Indulges for repose! These silver hairs So thinn'd, so whiten'd by the stealth of time, Shall the hard helmet bruise, and this old arm Sustain the shield once moreâwas this the cause? Was it, presuming on my feebler age, That Norway's haughty Monarch durst invade The realm of Denmark?âBy my sword, the thought New nerves each shatter'd limbâForth from thy sheath, Friend of my glory!âone task more remains, Which well perform'd, together we'll repose, Companions in the grave. SCENE II. Canute. Asmond. Canute. Son of my youth! Say, Asmond, has the bold invader own'd That, envious of thy father's fame, he comes With great ambition to subdue Canute? To mock the efforts of his feebler arm, And tear the laurels from his aged brow? Asmond. As yet the cause of Valdemar's descent Is not proclaim'dâbut, if report be true, He comes not, mov'd by envy, or contempt, Or wild ambitionâVengeance is his motive For injur'd honour. Canute. Forty years are fled Since from his father's vanquish'd arm I won The spoils of Arvor. Asmond. 'Tis a recent cause, When crown'd with victory on the plains of Lemor, The feast of triumph thro' these splendid halls Proclaim'd your high successâEach warriour chief That shar'd the toils of battle and the praise, Was then by name invited to partake The honours of your boardâsave only twoâ The friends alone had not your royal summons. Canute. Whom callest thou the friends? Asmond. Known by that name Are Ostan and Berino; Nature's twins; To whom one heart she gave, one valiant heart, Generous and faithfulâSide by side they fought On Lemor's plain; each studious to divert The stroke directed at his dearer friend, More than to shield his own brave breast from harm. Canute. Such virtues we admire; nor were the friends Rejected, but forgot. Asmond. The seeming slight Stung to the soul of honourâPatriot love, And fair allegiance by the wound expir'd. Rashly to Norway's hostile shores they sled, And bow'd, tho' born in Denmark, meanly bow'd To Valdemar your foe. Canute. Low-thoughted traitors! But is it then by their persuasions mov'd That Valdemar presumes t'invade my realm, And hopes he with two fugitives of mine To conquer me and Denmark? Asmond. Fame has told A different taleâReturning from the chace, When first young Ostan came to Norway's queen, And graceful threw his trophies at her feet, Love, which is Nature's sympathy, and acts Uninfluenc'd by reason, sudden seiz'd The beauteous LenaâInstantly they fled From Norway's realm to Denmarkâand the fleet Moor'd on our stormy coasts, pursued the lovers. Canute. Was this the cause? Then why not such proclaim'd By the first herald that approach'd our shores? We yield no refuge to the faithless wife, Or guest ungratefulâLove, wherever plac'd With innocence, might justly claim protection, And Denmark's sons expect it from their king, Tho' worlds were in the way. But, Asmond, here, Tho' thou, methinks, wouldst smooth a guilty passion, And found the cause in natureâJustice claims That here no sword be lifted but her own. Asmond. Whate'er your royal wisdom shall determine, 'Tis always mine t'approve; for duty thus Is wisdom: but, alas! when careless years, Elate with wild festivity of heart, Fly in full chace of pleasure, hard the task To stop the mad pursuit! Eager of soul, Impetuous, and impatient of restraint, With passions uncontroul'd, and chusing still What wears the face of dangerâOstan brooks not Reflection's silent thought, nor hears the voice Of cool, deciding reasonâyet he boasts Virtues that might his slighter foibles veil. The generous heart is his; the living glow Of soul-uniting friendship; scorning fear, And all that's low, or little, the sublime, Unconquer'd mind. Canute. A character like this Becomes a man of Denmark. Asmond. Not less brave, Nor to his friend less faithful is Berino. But, temper'd mild, his equal virtues shine With steadier light, nor sully their fair flame With deeds of indiscretion. Led by friendship More than resentment, probably, he fled To Norway's court, and now resolves to share In Ostan's fortunes, while he disapproves His conduct. Canute. Virtues such as these may veil Inferior faults; but where the public love Is lost in private, friendship is a crime. Asmond. The tongue of Asmond shall not plead for crimes. But where a brave man's character is weigh'd, Humanity would drop into the scale Each circumstance of favour. Canute. Soon his bravery, Or innocence, or both shall have their trial Is Lother yet return'd? Asmond. With every moment, Such his young ardour for the works of war, I now expect himâhad he not your orders To learn the cause of Valdemar's descent, And mark the motions of his host? Canute. Such orders He had from meâDelay not his report. SCENE III. Asmond. O wreaths of glory, won so oft, and worn By the cold brows of Death!âHow many sons Have Denmark's ravag'd hills, and vales, bedew'd With her own blood, bewail'dâOft on her moors, Marking the dim stone near the Warrior's grave, E'en the hard hunter stops, and from his eye Slow steals the stranger tear. The virgin sad Roves by the pale moon o'er the lonely heath, And, every fear forgot in strong despair, Mourns o'er the turf where the dear relics lie Of blasted hope and loveâOn Lemor's shores What numbers fell! and shall these ravag'd hills, These vales bedew'd with blood, once more bewail Their brave inhabitants? Shall Asmond live To mourn his future subjects? Painful thought! My aged father!âShall the brave Canute, Now, all but trembling with the weight of years, Those years forgetting, meet th'impetuous foe, And bare his gray head to the hostile dart? Shall Lotherâat that name the parent bleeds,â Ere time has strengthen'd his unsinew'd arm, Pour his young life upon the deathful plain, And blast the hopes of Denmark?â SCENE IV. Asmond, Lother. Asmond. Looks of joy! Then, Lother, is the fierce invader fled? Has he, more wise, withdrawn his hostile fleet, And sought the rocks of Norway? Lother. Swift as winds, His gleamy cars dart o'er the trembling plain, And his dark squadrons hide an hundred hills. From shield to shield the scatter'd sun beams dance, Trembling in dreadful gloryâO my father! A conquest here is worthy the ambition Even of those valiant breasts that oft have conquer'd, E'en of the sons of DenmarkâLet me share In the rich honours of that glorious day, Which drowns yon host in blood, and at your feet Thus gratitude shall fall. Asmond. Lother, no more! If Denmark's king shall doom that unbrac'd arm Again to ache beneath the ponderous shield, And tempt the rage of war, we know our duty; Yet name it not, I charge thee, nor sollicit, What well thou know'st, too prodigal of life, Thy prince would scarce refuse; but hast thou learnt The real cause that brings these ravagers On Denmark's war-worn coasts? Lother. Report for once Has brought a tale of truth. The brave Berino (For Lemor's blood-stain'd heath has known him brave) Wand'ring I met along the midway hills, Pensive, as one that courted solitude To cherish painful thought. A manly sorrow Sate on his noble aspectâwhen he rais'd His drooping eye to me, like one he seem'd, Whom generous shame could wound, unknown to fear. With friendly words I hail'd him, and assur'd His valour and his virtues still were dear To Denmark's princes, though his rash revolt Might rouse their just resentmentâ Asmond. Still remember To treat distress with such humanity; For oft it is the lot of noble natures, Tho' rashness were it's cause. What did he tell thee Concerning this invasion? Lother. âMark,â he cried, âThe waving ensigns of yon hostile camp! âThere read Berino's anguish and disgrace. âFor Norway's Queen, a fugitive of love, âWith my too daring Ostan, those dark hosts âInvade my country; prince, I blush to seem âAssociate in a cause like this, but friendship âStill holds my heart to Ostan, nor in death âWill I desert him.â Asmond. O distinguish'd honour! Exalted sentiments, whate'er their object! Lother, we must not suffer this brave youth To fall devoted in the threaten'd ruin, A sacrifice to friendshipâBut the king Expects each moment thy return; inform him Of what thou know'st minutely, nor forget One circumstance in favour of Berinoâ [Exit Lother. Avilda! ah! another grief! But love,â SCENE V. Asmond, Avilda. Avilda. Didst thou not name Berino? Yet that sound Thrills on mine earâDidst thou not name Berino? Asmond. Love has no temples in the field of war, And every weaker passion must give way To Denmark's safety. Avilda. Asmond, too, unkind? Then am I lost indeed; yet tell me, prince, My once most tender brother, tell Avilda If she has yet one anxious hour to live, Or is her dear Berino now condemn'd To suffer for th'enormous crime of friendship? Asmond. You wrong my tenderness if you suppose I would not stretch my utmost power to save himâ That fault of friendship yet may render vain My best endeavoursâstill attach'd to Ostan, If with determin'd ardour he pursues His dangerous fortunes. Avilda. Asmond, from one source The stream of life we drewâfed from one breast, By one affection cherish'dâIf that love, That tenderest love, which melts in sisters heart, E'er touch'd thy bosom, save the gallant youth, From his own virtues save him; if his friendship Would urge him to destruction. Asmond. Has my conduct Made such intreaties needful? Avilda. Ever kind! Forgive, once more, the vain sollicitudes Of female fear and loveâwhen the first sigh Stole from my breast unconscious; when the tear Sprung sudden at the tender thought; the blush Unbidden glowing; when the lonely walk At eve's late hour withdrew me from the palace, In luxury of solitude, you mark'd This change of conduct with a brother's eye, Nor let the sweet distraction prey unknown In silence on my heartâFor ever faithful, You kept th'important secret of my soul E'en from the object of my love, and promis'd, When Denmark's crown should rest on Asmond's head, Each wish should be accomplish'dâwhat I've suffer'd From Ostan's rash revolt, what now I suffer From all it's dire effects, th'uncertain fate Of desolating war, and the firm justice Of our indignant father, Asmond, judge, And then forgive my weakness. Asmond. Love oft strengthens A woman's courage, heightens oft her fears, Gives to the fearful an unwonted boldness, The bold unwonted fear. Tho' timorous now, Avilda oft has prov'd in fortitude The daughter of CanuteâHer infant heart Beat to the trumpet's clangorâand her eye With pleasure glanc'd to meet the shining faulchion, Oft has her hand the temper'd cuirass bound On her brave father's breastâOft has she beg'd At distance but to mark his glorious toil, And panted to pursue him thro' his dangers. Avilda. Kind as thou art, why wouldst thou, prince, recall Past days of happiness, when my free breast Knew no wild passions, felt no anxious fears, Save for a father's, or a brother's safety? Asmond. Far happier had that kind anxiety To Lemor's heath ne'er led thee!âyet if there Thy virgin heart first yielded to the stroke Of all subduing loveâwell hast thou won The pity of that brother, on whose dangers Thy dear affection drew thee to attend. Avilda. O day! to memory painful still and dear! When glowing from the recent toils of war, His bright locks scatter'd o'er his ardent cheek, Carelessâand Victory dancing in his eye, Berino caught my soulâa wounded friend Hung feebly on his arm, on whom he look'd With inexpressive tendernessâ Asmond. That friend Was OstanâThro' the battle's bleeding van By headlong valour led, cover'd with wounds, Beset with foes, and the last stroke of death From every hand impending, the brave youth Flew to his rescue, and in triumph led him Tho' weak, to safety; thus he prov'd his friendship, And thus he won thy love. Avilda. O love hard-fated! O friendship ill-repaid! Is this the meed? Is this the grateful recompence of life That Ostan gives his friend? Thus to involve him In all the evils that his own rash conduct Has drawn upon him! Asmond. To avert those evils Is my immediate careâAnd thou, Avilda, Encourage gentle hope; of which one ray For love's quick eye suffices. Denmark's safety Our first attention claimsâyet rest assur'd, The object of a sister's happiness Asmond can ne'er forget. SCENE VI. Avilda. May all the powers That watch o'er Denmark make thee more successful Than my heart bodesâAndâO thou Spirit that rul'st The star whose bright urn sheds his golden light O'er evening's azure veil; thou spirit of Love, That pour'st soft anguish into mortal hearts, The painful tenderness, the sweet destruction Of peace and dear indifference; gentle spirit, If ever Pity at thy rosy shrine, Prefer'd one tender vow; if ever Hope, By thee inspir'd, not prophesied in vain; Indulge the fond wish of one suppliant maid, And save, o saveâ SCENE VII. Avilda, Berino. Avilda. Audacious chief, who art thou? That thus intrudest on the solitude Of Denmark's Princessâ Berino. May I hope for pardon? Illustrious daughter of the brave Canute, You see no bold intruder, but a suppliant. I came a suppliant to the Prince of Denmark, And, misdirected, hop'd to find him here. Avilda. Wherefore a suppliant? Hast thou then a crime? Berino. I cannot boast of innocence, but hope, For this offence, that I retire forgiven. Avilda. Stay, youth; perhaps my interest with my brother May not be useless; and, methinks, that look Ingenuous speaks a soul incapable Of crimes beyond th'extent of royal grace. Berino. O princess, more than worthy the fair fame That all the North's extended regions fills With your distinguish'd virtues! fruitless here Were all your generous efforts to assist A wretch who courts the tardy hand of justice To save him from the anguish of remorse, And end a painful beingâKnow, I am Berino,âneeds there more? Avilda (aside) Too well I know it!â Oh! hold, my heart, thy purposeâBut what here, What shall I say, or do?âDirect me Heaven! Berino. O Chief of Denmark! O disgrac'd Berino! How fall'n from thy fair honours! At thy name The cheek of virtue reddens, and the eye Of innocence with pity, or contempt, Or both, beholds thee. Avilda. Youth, mistake me not, I know not anger, if I know contempt, 'Tis for abandon'd and unblushing guilt. That, surely, is not thineâI am no stranger To the sad story of that joyless look, And that dejected eye: I am no stranger To the firm friendship which you bear to Ostan, It's glorious cause, or it's effects less glorious. Yet pity, surely, is at least your due; And pityâwas th'emotion that I felt For you and for your fortunes. Berino. Generous princess! How ill, alas! I've merited this goodness, Yon host clad hills in threatening pomp proclaim Loud thro' the realm of Denmarkâan associate In Ostan's flight I wasâHis friend I am, Nor even in Death will I desert himâJustice To an offended Prince, the law of nations, Perhaps even Denmark's safety may demand One victim hereâThat victim let me fallâ A Chief of Denmark given to his revenge May Norway's Prince appease, and the rich blood That pours a warm tide to each Patriot breast, It's azure urns retain. Avilda. Mistaken Chief! Too prodigal of life! 'Twere vain to think That Norway's Monarch would accept a victim To favour his escape who wounds his honour, And violates his loveâ'Twere vain to hope That Denmark's King would doom the innocent And give the guilty freedomâChiefâyet more! Thy country may demand an arm like thine, Approv'd in valourâwould'st thou, then, redeem Her alienated love? would'st thou repair The injuries thy daring friend has done her, Live for her service and her safetyâThus, And on these terms alone may'st thou expect My royal father's, or my brother's favourâ That favour now I hasten to solicit, And may the Gods that smile on Denmark guard thee!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Cottage in a mountainous Desart. Lena. Dear, horrid hours of unpermitted joy! What anxious moments does the woman pass, Who riots in the arms of lawless love! But ah! when Danger's threatening form invades The scene of stolen happiness; tho' dearer, Tho' then more exquisite the theft of bliss, Sure misery is behindâPerhaps, e'en now The troops of Norway range o'er these wild hills To seek their low-fall'n queenâwith insolence, With all th'unmanner'd rage of vulgar power They treat her name, and tread on her lost honour. Perhaps e'en nowâsurrounding this poor cottage, They meditate with rude hands unrestrain'd By royalty, or awe of greatness lost. To drag me to their injur'd kingâoh! horror! More than ten thousand deaths is in the thought. Hah! heard I not the sound of hasty steps? âNo! all is silentâPeace, thou busy sprite, Life-chilling Fear, that, acting still the friend, Art in thyself a traitorâThee the heart Admits it's guardianâwrapt in thy embrace, Thy cold embrace, it diesâand wakeful Prudence, That watches thy alarm, oppress'd by thee, Confus'd, defenceless, droopsâO foe to Love! Yet, ever in his train; with cruel skill Prompting the anxious thought! pale sprite, away! For lo! he comes, who never felt thy power. SCENE II. Lena, Ostan. Ostan. O pride of Norway! fairer than the dawn, That o'er your snow-bright mountains breaks away In pure, unspotted gloryâQueen of charms, Tho' Norway's queen no more; the nobler empire Of love, and beauty thine, why broods pale Fear Upon thy damask cheek? That beaming eye, In whose soft rays a thousand graces play; Why is it clouded? Lena. Dost thou ask the cause? When haply round these wild and desert hills, With steps unwearied, and vindictive search, Range the dark hosts of Norwayâ Ostan. Vain that fearâ The toilsome circuit of these mountainous heights, And all the ragged vales that stretch away In horror from their sides, have I explor'd, Nor seen one human form, save at his chace The low-born peasantâ Lena. Such a visitant, In Ostan's absence, would not be less dreadful Than a whole host of foes. Ostan. Vain too that fear! If at the sight of beauty tamely bend The shaggy lion, shall a human monster Indulge a thought of outrage? Lena. Chief of Denmark! Thou, only thou canst charm my busy fears, And sooth to rest the heaving heart of care, With thy enchanting presenceâO belov'd! And dearer still in danger! Do not leave me! Forsake me not, my Ostan! since for thee, I've left my royal honours, left my kingdom, And every friend that fortune, or alliance Had given me there, have forfeited for thee. Ostan. Spirits of Denmark! canst thou fear such meanness? Now by those air-born beings that preside O'er these wild rocks, and ride yon waving clouds, Should Valdemar exhaust his icy realms Of her rude-handed sons, 'till not one slave Were seen on all her solitary hillsâ Should heâsurrounded with his iron-race, Invest this bough-built shed, he should not tear thee From my inclosing armsâ Lena. Forgive me, Ostan! I know thee valiant, and believe thee faithful; Yet trembling for th'uncertain fate of war, Dreading the dire event of this invasion, And, fearful ev'n for thee who know'st no fear, Forgive this importunity of Love. One favour only would I now sollicit, Which granted, soon it's wonted smile shall dwell On my dejected visageâValdemar, And all his host will vanish from my thought, And I shall deem this bough-built shed a palace. Ostan. Can Lena ask what Ostan would refuse? Lena. Whate'er may be th'event of this invasion; Rear'd on the tallest mount of Denmark's realm, Should Death and Ruin grasp their horrid hands In dreadful league; and rush upon their preyâ Should the war bleed thro' all her wasted valesâ Should ghastly Slaughter unresisted rage, 'Till his yell pierce the solitary van Of these sequester'd wildsâAssure me, Ostan, That neither by thy martial genius led, That neither tempted by the thirst of glory, By hate of Norway's king, nor love reviv'd Of thy once-slighted country, thou wilt join The general ruin, wander from my side, Or leave me to my fears. Ostan. O torturing thought! Lena. Hah! dost thou hesitate? Ostan. Fair queen, indulge me! My country, tho' once slighted, when involv'd In hostile ruin I behold, it urges The cold blood to my heartâWhy did you paint In such strong colours the distressful scene? Lena. To know myself the abject wretch I am. To know that thou wouldst leave me helpless here, Expos'd to savages, opprest with want, And overwhelm'd with fear, t'indulge the vain, The sanguinary thirst of battleâGo! No longer sooth me with false forms of loveâ Hear'st thou the clarion's sound? it calls thee from me The battle bleeds, and wilt thou loiter here To parly with a woman? Ostan. Queen of Norway! Lena. That title now is insultâwould'st thou call me By any name my dueâconsult my follies, And consequent misfortunesâfrom the train Some epithet select; with that address me, And call me what I am, a wretch forsaken. Ostan. O cruel to yourself! Forego distrust, Groundless and vain! What has your Ostan done To merit this unkindness? That a sigh Stole from his bosom o'er the painful scene That Denmark's plains in prostrate ruin laid, Why should it move thy fear, or thy suspicion? The heart that wakes to love's soft impulse, feels The Patriot's ardor; but thy shrine, O Love! Thy sacred shrine shall never be deserted, And all the wreaths of Valour, Victory, Glory, Here will I sacrifice. Lena. And all the ties Of friendship. Ostan. I have a friend, and interposing worldsâ Lena. Shall not divide your fatesâ Ostan. I have a friendâ Lena. I know thou hast, and if that friend should join In Denmark's cause against the arms of Norway, Then wouldst thouâ Ostan. Be a tame ungrateful slave? NoâBy th'eternal Spirits that roll'd yon Sun Into a globe of fire, and bad him burn The cheek that never blush'd for broken faith, While my heart beats, and while my hand can grasp One dart of Vengeance, thro' the ranks of battle Berino shall not urge his dangerous way, While Ostan stays behindâ Lena. Lost, wretched Lena! How vainly didst thou dream that thou wert first In Ostan's heart. Ostan. Thou art the first of women, And from a warrior, Queen, what wouldst thou more? Shall I be base, ungrateful, faithless, false! Shall I desert the friend that shar'd my fortunes, My dangers shar'dâthe friend to whose brave sword I owe the last breath that I drewâthe life That animates this eye to look on thee, This pulse that throbs at thy inchanting touch, Shall I desert him, while this pulse can beat, This eye can look on thee? Lena. Hark; didst thou hear The sound of some approaching foot? O save me! Still it advancesâSave me from the sword Of Valdemar! Ostan. Thy fears are vain!â'Tis heâ It is Berino. SCENE III. Lena, Ostan, Berino. Ostan. Dearest, best of friends! Embrac'd for ever in my heartâApproach, And let my arms embrace thee! Berino. Still my friend! Whom never change of fortune, or of time Shall banish from my breastâwhile the soul wakes And the blood wanders thro' the veiny ways Of this mechanic beingâstill my friend! But ah! how useless my attentions now! And yet, I would have serv'd thee. Ostan. Cease thy cares, And every kind anxiety for me. To see thee live, to hold thee to my heart, Is now my happiness, and wouldst thou wish This pleasure to continue; all the service I ask, or hope from thy unwearied kindness Is to partake of this unknown retreat, Companion to a Queen, tho' in a cottage. Lena. Thrice gallant Chief! and worthy Ostan's friendship, If aught my poor intreaties might avail, In this retirement to detain thee, pride And joy would soothe my heart, tho' Norway's Queen No moreâ Berino. The powerful charm of friendship needs No other motiveâTrust me, beauteous Queen, Would it ensure your safetyâwould it guard My Ostan's life, amid these lonely shades I'd dwell a Hermit to the dregs of age, Feed on the wood's wild fruits with greater gust Than at the palace board, and drink the fountain. Lena. Then, Chief, thou wilt not leave us, wilt not draw Thy Ostan from my armsâ Ostan. For ever generous! Berino, my full heart in silence thanks thee. Berino. Yet this, my friends, is but a dream of safety. Since, to avoid the dire event of war, Should Valdemar demand, and Denmark's King Agree to yield you victims to his rage, In vain would you depend on these wild woods To screen you from their searchâunited armies Would ransack all these hills, and range these groves, 'Till not a sapling should remain unnoted. Lena. Lost, wretched Lena! Norway's haughty King!â Ah! shall he blast thee with his flaming eye? Shall he enfold his hard hand in thy hair? And drag thee to the earth? He shall, he shallâ And there is no escapeâ Berino. Yet, beauteous Queen! Suspend thy fears; the pride of Valdemar, And high resentment haply may demand Such terms as Denmark's Monarch, keen to war, And delicate of honour, shall disdain To yieldâ Ostan. What can we hope from thence? Berino. A battle Follows of course, and Valdemar may fall, And Denmark's arms may conquer: by our service By our united efforts in the field 'Twill then be our's that favour to regain So needful to your safety.â Ostan. Hateful service! But not to be avoidedâyet, my friend, Yet when I think on all our glorious toil On Lemor's shores repaid with negligence, My vex'd blood boils, and every stroke my hand Directs at Denmark's foes, my heart will envy. Nay should Canute himself, with offer'd favour Applaud my servicesâthe tardy kindness 'Twould pain me to receiveâ Berino. We are not now So circumstanc'd as when the splendid feast In Agar's echoing hall then crown'd the toils Of victoryâBy us o'erwhelm'd with foes, Our Country calls on her apostate sons, And warns us of our duty. Ostan. Thou hast wak'd A thousand tender thoughtsâAh Denmark! yes! I lov'd thy green vales, lov'd thy wild, brown hills, And oft ere manhood brac'd my limbs, have climb'd To their aspiring tops, with boyish fancy, To image armies in the evening-clouds. Oft, listening from the rock's projecting brow, My rapt ear fed upon the far-heard sounds Of the deep-toning horn, and my young breast Burn'd for the fancied battle. Ah! my Country! I feel thee at my heart. Berino. 'Tis Nature's law. She bade us love those native fostering fields That spread their green laps for our infant sports; And, acting still from kindness all her own, She makes love gratitude, and pleasure virtue. Lena. Save, save me, Ostan! See thro' yonder glade, An armed man walks warily along, Looking as if in searchâHah! he approachesâ Ostan. He has the air of Lotherâ Berino. 'Tis the sameâ Why has he trac'd me into this retreat? What can it mean? Lena. What shall we do? Berino. Retire, And leave me to engage himâYour abode If possible, must yet remain unknown. SCENE IV. Lother, Berino. Lother. This way he came, and surely here are traces Of human art and handsâ Berino. Hail Son of Asmond! Illustrious Hope of Denmark! Do I see My Prince in this poor shed? Lother. Distinguish'd Virtue, Hid in a cave, or shining in a court, Alike demands attentionâGallant Chief, Shall Lother own that in this poor retreat, Obscure, and in disgrace, thou yet couldst rouse His soul to envy? Berino. Prince, thou canst not mock me, For thou art generous: but are grief and flight, Endanger'd friendship, and insulted fame Conditions to be envied? Lother. Not for these I envy thee, but pityâthe great Soul, The nobly social Mind, of each mean view Divested, firm and daring e'en to Deathâ These, Chief, are thine, and these are to be envied. Berino. By all but those who boast of equal Virtues, And, therefore, not by LotherâBut to me Why this fair palm of undeserved praise, I know notâ Lother. Denmark's Princess dost thou know? Berino. Gracious and fair; yes, recent proofs I've had Of her distinguish'd goodnessâwhen I sought The Prince, your Father's ear, she kindly offer'd Her interest in my favour; but refus'd To serve me in the only way I wish'dâ Yet then she shew'd me what I wish'd was vain And even impracticable. Lother. Yet the proposal Was great, was glorious, and became Berino. For that, brave Chief, I envy and admire thee. Gods! to pour forth at Friendship's holy Shrine The young, warm vital tideâonce more to rescue The friend thy valour sav'd before, and this By life's last forfeitâ Berino. Were no sacrifice Of such uncommon meritâWhat is life, Depriv'd of friendship? When each charm is lost, Each dear dependence on the mutual heart, Firm, cordial, confidentâthen what is life? Perish the mean wretch, whose low thought can hide One sordid wish, that centers in himselfâ To me no joy, no flattering scene of Hope To me is heart-felt, if no friend partakes The solitary banquetâLife itself, It's joys, its prospects uncommunicated, Is but a lonely dream, where waking thought Enjoys a Miser's pleasure. Lother. Brave I knew thee, Thrice gallant Chief, on Lemor's groaning shores I knew thee brave; and now, well hast thou prov'd True valour only in the generous heart Holds his fair residenceâ'Tis my ambition, Nor is that pride unworthy of a Prince, To boast Berino's friendshipâChief, with thee, I mean to share the wreaths of glorious toil, With thee to pierce the deep-embattled Host, And, should thy brave breast lose it's faithful mail, Amidst advancing foes, with my own hands I'll snatch this honest Cuirass from my bosom, And bind it on thy heart. Berino. Forget not, Prince, That I'm a fugitive. Lother. By Heav'n thou art notâ Rapt with the luxury of love and praise, My message was forgotâI came to tell thee That Denmark's Monarch, with thy Virtues charm'd, Gives thee free pardon; and the Prince, my Father Invites thee to his court. Berino. Distinguish'd favours! And worthy all acknowledgment; but friendship My first attention claimsâthat duty paid, Expect to see me in the halls of Agar, Obedient to my Prince. 'Till then adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A Grove behind the Palace of Canute. Avilda. With what a dull pace the old hours of time Post to a lover's wishes!âEven thou, Slow-sailing moon, whose deep and cumbrous train Of dim clouds seems thy passage to retard, Mov'st with a swifter course, and o'er this grove, Since yet I've waited the return of Lother, Thy transient rays have stol'n from tree to tree, 'Till now 'tis left one deep-involving shade, Awefully silent. SCENE II. Avilda, Asmond. Asmond. Daughter of Canute, These lonely glooms are melancholy's empire, Cherish it's saddening influence in the heart, And feed the fires of loveâLet thy attention No more in Fancy's airy regions stray; I bring thee tidings better to employ it. Avilda. Is Lother then return'd? and dost thou bring me Hopes of Berino's safety? Asmond. Doubt not that; Tho' Lother yet returns notâFrom the camp Of Valdemar a haughty herald came, Fraught with high menaces, and vain contempt Of Denmark's valiant sons; such terms he brought, As our brave father with disdain rejected; And when he heard the insolent demand Not of the noble fugitives alone, But of a tribute from his own lov'd realm, His aged arm with rage shook, and his eye Sparkled with honest vengeance. The proud herald There read his answer, and retir'd. Avilda. 'Twas well Methinks, the woman's tenderness gives way To nobler sentiments; those terms of insult Have rous'd me from the weak captivity Of idle fear and love; my Father's spirit Resumes it's long lost empire in my breast, And I have now no other feelings there But for his honour and for Denmark's safety. Asmond. There in his daughter spoke Canute, and there What was AvildaâPrincess, still preserve That higher tone of mind; nor, 'midst our dangers, Sink into weakness: many cares await me. Adieu! SCENE III. Avilda. I feel strange tumults in my breast. 'Tis indignation swells it, at the thought Of Valdemar's bold insultâYet, methinks, Fear presses on my heartâI know not whyâ What should I fear? All weaker passions fly, Or ought to flyâThis moment I discard themâ And think of nothing but a father's safety. SCENE IV. Avilda, Lother. Lother. Princess, thrice worthy of your generous care, And kind protection was the gallant youth; And well his virtues claim his Sovereign's favour. Avilda. Talk not, young prince, in idle strains of praise On private virtue; when the public safety Demands our sole attention! Hast thou learnt The haughty message from the camp of Norway? Thou hast notâKnow then that the spirit of war Is rous'd to sleep no more, 'till by the hands Of death and havock his fell eyes are clos'd, And Denmark's sons are slaves, or Norway bends Her hard neck to the yokeâ Lother. Perish the day, When Denmark's glory falls, and perish all That envy her fair honours! By the soul Of holy freedom,âby each sword that gleams O'er many an aweful shrine of heroes dead, That grasp'd her to their hearts, I will not live To drag the bonds of any haughty being That is not more than man, and, like myself, Breathes but by privilege of common air! No, Lother's life, and Denmark's honour wound On the same fated clue, the hand of Death Shall ravel off togetherâ [Going. Avilda. Stay, young prince, Thy patriot valour, and thy liberal mind I knew, nor meant I to reproach theeâ Lother. These I go to proveâ'till then withhold that praise. Avilda. Yet stayâMethinks, some circumstanceâYou found The friend of Ostanâ Lother. So I would have told you. Avilda. It matters notâa weightier business claim'd Thy care, and claims it still. Lother. I know it well. [Going. Avilda. Yet why this haste? That gallant chief, you said, Was not unworthy of the royal favour. But how did he receive it? Lother. With due sense Of gratitude and duty; tho' some office Of sacred friendship, claiming then his care, Prevented his acknowledgmentâ Avilda. [Aside.] Ah me! I fear that friendshipâFear! I know it notâ Weak thoughts away! Lother. Princess, you seem to view With fear unusual this approaching war: Yet dread not the eventâThe sons of Denmark Can still defend her daughtersâThe brave youth Who has your royal father's pardon, soon Will join our arms, and his well omen'd valour Will make success less doubtfulâ Avilda. Foolish heart! Forego thy weakness! Prince, your present cares Are due to DenmarkâLet me not detain you. SCENE V. Avilda. O Love! Thou source of everlasting fears, And discontent, and pain! Suspend thy sway! Power of the throbbing heart, and pensive eye, Cease thy unquiet empire in my breast, And leave me to the calm society Of fortitude and reasonâSure I see, Or does the shifting shade deceive me? Noâ A woman wandering in this lonely grove! At this untimely hour!âSome wretch like me, Who vainly courting sleep to soothe her cares, Indulges them in these congenial shades. Perhaps another slave to the wide empire Of all-subduing LoveâMy own attendants I thought secureâ SCENE VI. Avilda, Lena. Avilda. Lady, to wander in these pensive glooms, Preventing the fair harbinger of morn, Speaks not a mind at easeâPerhaps some sorrow Dwells on your burthen'd heart, or some soft care Usurps the throne of restâCommand me, lady, If I have power to serve you. Lena. My misfortunes Are such as leave no exercise for hope, As neither time, nor pity can redress, And only death can end. Avilda. Then death, I fear, Has brought them first upon youâhas divided From your torn heart some friend that it embrac'd, And left you to the pangs of hopeless sorrow. Lena. Have you compassion? Are you touch'd with pity? Seek not to know the cause of my distressâ The only favour you have power to grant me Is an asylum from the searching world; Some secret cell, where I may rest unseen, The object of your private charity. Avilda. Art thou opprest?âIn fear of human hate, Or violence?âThen look for sure protection In Denmark's kingâThe justice of Canute Will be your best asylum; and my care Shall not be wanting with my royal father To win you every graceâ Lena. [Aside.] O wretched Lena! What horrid fate hangs o'er thee? Avilda. Ever just, And studious to redress his injur'd subjects, Tho' an impending war demands his cares, You will be heard. Lena. Oh! insupportable! Lost, lost is every prospect of escape! Avilda. What mean those wild words? Lena. Princess, you behold In me the cause of that impending war; Then yield me to the justice of your fatherâ Better to perish by a stranger's sword Than to the rage of Valdemar resign'd, Encounter shame, and insolence and scorn, Ere death, with purpos'd cruelty withheld, Shall end my wretched beingâ Avilda. Powers of Denmark! Are you that hapless queen, whose fatal flight Brings the dark hosts of Norway on our shores? If so, what madness, or what strange mischance Could lead you to approach the residence Of Denmark's Monarch? Lena. 'Twas, indeed, mischance: If aught by me may so be deem'd, whom hope Has totally deserted. Avilda. Should I pity, I have no power to save you, queen! Lena. I ask No other means of safety than to shun The presence of the haughty Valdemarâ If you have no asylum, yet, even death Will be protection, and I ask for that. Avilda. Alas! fair queen, I feel for your misfortunes, Nor would I add to misery's heavy load, Howe'er occasion'dâPity I can give you, But cannot give you hopeâShould I attempt To plead for mercy with my royal father, Yet his strict justice might withhold his ear From all compassion's eloquence could urge. And thus my vain endeavours to protect you Might hasten your destructionâ Lena. Would your father Yield me to Norway's king? Avilda. I fear not thatâ Lena. Then nought have I to fearâ Avilda. A haughty message From Valdemar precludes all thoughts of peace And every means of treatyâ Lena. Ah rash friend! Thou couldst foresee, then why not wait th'event? Thy too impetuous virtues have undone thee, And me, and all. Avilda. What friend, whose virtues? Ha! Lena. You are no stranger to the young Berino, The gallant friend of Ostanâ Avilda. Stranger! Queen! What wouldst thou? NoâMethinks I know that name. Lena. Yes, I have heard him speak, with grateful pleasure, Of Denmark's princessâof your kind intentions To recommend him to your royal father As not unworthy his indulgenceâThat, Tho' by no meaner messenger declar'd, Than Denmark's second hope, the son of Asmond, He held inferior to the ties of friendship, Nor would enjoy one shadow of enlargement, Freedom, or hope, that Ostan could not share. Avilda. [Aside.] Hapless Avilda! destin'd to regret Those virtues I admire! Lena. Yet had this zeal Been bounded here!âbut from his parting words Too plain he meant a sacrifice to friendship That friendship could not bearâ Avilda. Death to my heart! Forbear! What wouldst thou say? proceedâ Lena. You seem With no indifferent eye to view my fortunesâ This generous pityâ Avilda. Torture worse than death! What didst thou mean? what sacrifice? Lena. Himself. Avilda. Whom? Lena. Negligent of life, the brave Berino To Valdemar a twofold challenge sent, One, in behalf of Denmark, to engage The bravest chief of Norway; if success Should crown his first attempt, a bold defiance Of Valdemar himself, in Ostan's name, To break the shivering lanceâ Avilda. Was this accepted? Lena. I know not that; in vain with prayers and tears I sought to win him from his purposeâconscious That Ostan would not suffer him alone To try the dangerous combatâThis I fear'd, Nor groundless were my fears; for tho' Berino Conjur'd his friend by all the ties of honour, By every thought of kindness, to relinquish This enterprize to him, nor then permitted To join his steps, impatient soon he follow'd. Ere long the noise of hunters at the chace, Or rovers sent from the Norwegian camp, Drove me in terror from my lone retreat, And wildering night has led me to these shades. Avilda. That tale, O wretched queen, that tale is pregnant With horror, death and ruin, more than thou Canst feel, or fearâAffairs of highest import Demand the present momentâQueen, farewell! My women shall have orders to attend you To some more hospitable place. SCENE VII. Lena. In deathâ In the dark mansions of unconscious dust Alone can such a place be foundâfor there Terror, tho' deep in his own darkness wrapt, Knocks at the heart in vainâThe inward eye Of guilt is clos'd in endless night; and there The cheek of shame is paleâHa! who approaches, A man?âperhaps some friendly messenger Dispatch'd, in pity, by the good Avilda To serve me with his honest sword. SCENE VIII. Lena, Asmond. Lena. Approach; And, if some useful minister of fate, Be kindly expeditiousâLet thy sword Close the dark scene of terrour, and defend me From what I dread the most, a living death. Asmond. Deem not the prince of Denmark an assassin. Lena. I knew you notâforgive me, prince renown'd For wisdom, genius and humanity, Far as your father's armsâThe name of Asmond, Each lisping orphan can repeat, and widows By him supported, smiling o'er their babes, Teach them the name of Asmond. O that fate Which gave me birth in Denmark, there had kept me In some poor shed an object of his bounty; Nor rais'd me, by I know not what strange steps, To Norway's hated throne; where never peace, Or freedom smil'd upon my wretched hoursâ To shun the haughty Valdemar's rude arms, Gloomy as death, and as the savages, That range his hills, ferociousâto behold Once more my native countryâThese were motives Of no inferior force to urge my flight, Tho' haply still the busy voice of fame Ascribes it solely to a different cause. Asmond. Heavens! and are you then that ill fated queen? But how! in Denmark born? 'twas ever said And still believ'd, that Valdemar espous'd The daughter of a chief of Norwayâ Lena. Thus It was reported; but to serve what purpose, I never yet could learnâ'Twas false, however, In every circumstanceâthe tender matron Who rear'd my infancy with gentlest care, And lov'd me with a parent's fondness, told me In the last words of life, that I was born In Denmark, and from thence by stealth convey'd: More she could notâbut, speechless, to my hand Convey'd this bracelet, as if this might prove Some token of my birthâ Asmond. [Looking on the bracelet.] Oh!âO my child! My daughter! Lena. [Throwing herself at his feet.] Pitying Heaven! Asmond. Oh!âmy lost child! Lena. Indulgent Heaven! hast thou no mercies left? O strike me, strike me dead! Asmond. [Raising her.] My long lost child! Lena. Still lost! for ever lost!âoh! is it thus I find a parent? Thus I meet a father, With guilt and ruin in my train? And can you, Do you forbear to spurn me from you? Far As earth from heaven to spurn meâ? Dear, good prince! Methinks, you weepâ Asmond. Thou art, indeed, ill-fatedâ Snatch'd, when an infant, from thy nurse's arms, And borne we knew not whitherâEach pursuit, And every search was vain; tho' then at war With Norway, such base rapine in a foe We could not even suspectâThis well-known bracelet With her own hands thy tender mother lock'd Upon thy little armâ Lena. Ha! does she live? Shall I behold her? Asmond. Noâin the cold grave Long has she slept, unable to survive The loss of thee. Lena. O wretched! O my heart! This is too muchâ [Faints. Asmond. Help! Help! My child! My daughter! [Bears her off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A distant view of the Norwegian Camp. Ostan, Berino. Berino. One sacrifice my honest sword has paid To honour and to Denmark, one remains To friendship and to Ostan: That discharg'd, My heart shall lay it's load of duty down, And I shall be at rest; ev'n tho' the hand Of Valdemar prevail, in glorious rest, While honour, valour, friendship o'er my grave Shall strew the monumental wreathâ Ostan. That hour When the light beams upon my conscious eye, And it beholds thy pale corse on the ground, May tenfold darkness seal it! may I wander Wretched and blind, the sport of wantonness, And coward-fear hang on my abject heart, Dreading e'en Death! Berino. Have I not known thee brave? And all the generous ardor of thy friendship Have I not oft experienc'd?âLeave to me This equal combat; where 'tis arm to arm, And only life to lifeâA helpless woman Demands your aid, and would you stay to guard An armed warrior? Let the Queen of Norway Be Ostan's care. Berino shall attend! The King. Ostan. For Lena's safety I depend On her unknown retreat. Berino. For mine depend On my known sword. Ostan. But did not Valdemar Suspend his answer to your second challenge? Berino. Yes, 'till the sword of Sweno should be tried In Norway's cause, as mine was drawn for Denmark: Since that event has ended in my favour, I wait each moment his acceptance. Ostan. Love Can justify the faults of Love, and friendship, Perhaps, may do the sameâI owe thee much: Yet thou, methinks, hast cancell'd in this challenge A part of my vast debt, since thou hast robb'd me Of the high honour, and the great revenge Of meeting Valdemar in arms. Berino. Believe, There is no debt uncancell'd, and forgive The robbery, if such it must be deem'd, Tho' 'twere but for the motiveâOn thy care Depends the safety of a QueenâFor me, I live but for my friend, and in his service, A life of labour, or a death of wounds Alike were welcomeâ Ostan. O beyond the world, Belov'd, admir'd, exalted! my Berino, Greater in thy misfortunes, to be envied More for thy virtues than the pomp of Kings, Still let me thank, and still embrace theeâyield But yield me this one wish, and let my hand Engage the King of Norway. Berino. 'Tis not mine To yield, or to withhold it nowâthe law Of arms and honour binds me to the form Of my first challenge; nothing but the choice Of Valdemar can change the terms. SCENE II. Ostan, Berino, a Norwegian Herald. Ostan. Thy ensigns Speak thee an Herald from the King of Norway. Hast thou no charge to me? Herald. My message is To Ostan and Berino. Ostan, Berino. Thou hast sound them. Herald. Thus then the King of Norway and the Isles, The high-born Valdemar, sprung from the race Of OdinâFirst to Ostan, chief of Denmark: As thou hast basely broke the laws of nations, Each tie of Hospitality and Honour, And injur'd his best interestsâFirst to thee Deadly defiance, with high scorn he sends To try the mortal combat. Ostan. By the soul Of mighty Thor, whose brave blood warms my veins, Herald I bid the welcome. Herald. And thus, the King of Norway and the Isles, The high-born Valdemar, sprung from the race Of Odin, to Berino friend of Ostanâ Associate in his crimes, and of his cause The forward champion, when his trembling helm Shall yield to the flesh'd sword, thou next enjoy The privilege of death. Berino. Vain menaces! And impotent as vainâWords ill become A warrior, Herald; but bear back this message To thy proud Prince, and tell him from Berino, That his stunn'd hosts shall hear the dogs of Denmark Howl at his thin ghost ere to-morrow's sun. SCENE III. Ostan, Berino. Ostan. Once more, my friend, with pleasure I embrace thee, Who never brought distress upon my heart, But by unbounded kindnessâThere, indeed, Long hast thou play'd the tyrantâlong opprest me With ill-deserved favours; but to Fortune I owe this triumph o'er thy friendly zeal; And let thy brightening looks, my gallant friend, Allow me leave to thank her. Berino. Let her perish! Insidious foe to every great design, And every generous deed! she binds the brave In the same manacle that grasps the limbs, The vile limbs of the coward; many a mind, Of noble mould, and Heaven-informed soul, She dooms to watch a peasant's nod, and leads The sneaking steps of slaves and fools to honour. If yet she reigns on earth, may the right hand Of Odin thrust her to the realms of night, Eternally to perish! Ostan. Yet, my friendâ Yet let not discontent dwell on thy brow! Let not chagrin hang on the few short hours That may remain to friendship! Berino. Does thy heart Inform thee that those hours shall be but short? Wilt thou relinquishâ Ostan. By the holy ties Of everlasting truth, I charge thee, name not What dwells upon thine eye! Beware, my friend: Think'st thou that I can fear, or canst thou doubt The sword of Ostan? Berino. Never thoughts like those Betray'd thee to my heartâ SCENE IV. Ostan, Berino, Avilda in disguise as a messenger from the King of Denmark. Avilda. The King of Denmark Commands Berino to attend him. Berino. Were His orders urgent? Avilda. To the present moment. Berino. The King shall be obey'd. SCENE V. Ostan, Berino. Berino. This ill-tim'd message Is most perplexingâthe short space that lies Before th'approaching combat, should be sacred Alone to friendship. Ostan. Yet, methinks, 'tis well. This is no time to yield the fervent heart To gentler sentiments, or dear remembrance Of kindness past; when fortitude should fix On the firm breast her adamantine seal. But still one scene of tenderness remainsâ One softer moment to the Queen of Norway, Ere my sword reach the heart of Valdemar. Berino. 'Till that event, then, we shall meet no more. Let us embrace, my friend! Ostan. Adieu! Berino. Adieu! SCENE VI. Berino. Be still my heart! nor let unmanly softness Thy firmer tone relax!âTo breathe short sighs, To feel anxieties, and boding fears, Is female friendshipâYet the cause is obvious. I dread that Ostan's feebler arm will fail Against the powerful sword of Valdemarâ And should it failâah death to friendshipâwhy, Why would not fate permit me to enjoy The prior challenge? Why this sudden message That calls me to the court of Denmark? Strange That circumstance, and unexpectedâSure I've heard that voiceâI've seen that messengerâ In speech, in features strongly he resembled The fair Avilda; whose kind offices Have been so oft exerted in my favour. Ah! could I but aspire to hope! vain hopes! Romantic wishes hence! should I encourage By idle visions that long-smother'd flame Which nature kindled, reason still represt? Peace! foolish heart! was I not yesterday, A fugitive, an exile in disgraceâ Ha! yet again? SCENE VII. Berino, Avilda in the same disguise. Avilda. Why wilt thou thus delay? Chief, let me warn thee That thy immediate presence is expected At Denmark's court. And as thou mayst respect The favour of thy prince, it well becomes thee With haste obedient to attend his pleasure. Berino. I own it, gentle Herald, and I thank thee For this repeated caution; want of duty Occasion'd no delay; but hast thou learnt The purpose of this message? Avilda. If I have, Yet my commission only was to bear it. Berino. By all my best, and dearest hopes 'tis she! Now love direct me! Prudence be my guard! [aside. The generous favour of the brave Canute, And more, far more than merited indulgence Have join'd the ties of gratitude to duty. Much likewise do I owe the Prince of Denmark, To Lother much; but to the fair Avilda What am I not indebted? to her favour, To her kind offices alone I owe, And wish to owe her royal Father's pardon. Avilda (aside.) Ah flattering to my heart! but is this language With which Berino would address a Herald? For Norway's realm and all her icy Isles I would not be discover'dâGallant Chief, There is no time for parleyâ SCENE VIII. Berino. Is she gone? Gone, banish'd by my thoughtless indiscretion! How idle! how absurd to name the Princess! She blush'd, and fled in fear of a discovery. Such is the fate of Love, blind, witless love, For ever working it's own overthrow; Yet shall my steps at distance trace her slight, My straining eye toil for another glance, And she shall prove my kind conducting star, To her own fair abode, the court of Denmark. SCENE IX. A Plain before the Norwegian Camp. Valdemar. Where are those powers, those spirits of revenge, That issue from the darkest depth of Hell, And whip the groaning world? Ye fiends accurst, Why are ye yet so slow? Revenge delay'd Is tenfold torture; tho' the sweetest passion That ever wak'd the heart, if the rais'd arm Be once arrested in it's rapid motion, How bitter does it grow!âCurse on this stripling That trifles with my rage, while I debase The Monarch to engage a petty Chief! Yet in the general conflict might he scape The thunder of my arm, and yield another The life he owes to me; hence I descend To this decision; tho' contempt, at last, Has swallow'd up revenge, and when he shrinks Beneath my searching sword, I shall behold him With more disdain than pleasure. SCENE X. Valdemar, Ostan. Ostan. Tyrant! savage! Where have thy minions borne her? are they fled To the dark desarts of that ragged kingdom, Which thou and bears divide? fled from my sword? But they have left me thee! Valdemar. Now hold, my rage, A momentâFled? alas! good Chief! fled, say'st thou? NoâLena could not leave thee! fond and faithful, Could she forsake thee, Ostan? Surely, no! Haply she wander'd forth to gather food, Berries, or acorns of the wood; for Lena, The faithful Lena could not leave thy side. Ostan. Blue lightnings blast thee, and thy coward bands, That meanly stole her from me when alone, And unprotected! Valdemar. Is it possible? No! gallant Chief! Thou couldst not leave a woman Without protectionâLeave a Queen that lov'd thee, A faithful Queen! for such uncourtly act She might, indeed, forsake theeâShe might stray, For she had stray'd beforeâ Ostan. Yes know, proud King! To thy eternal torture, know she lov'd me! Oh! she was kind! with easy fondness kind! Soft as the evening-breeze that sinks to rest Within the folding flowerâtender as light, When dawning o'er the dewy rose it pours A mild and cautious rayâIn my fond arms O what sweet tumults swell'd her snowy breasts! Valdemar. Peace slave! Ostan. What nameless soft emotions beam'd In her fair eye! What lovely languishment! Valdemar. Insolent slave! Ostan. O hours of extasy! When thrown at ease upon my circling arm, Her beauteous head, and many an upward glance Fraught with sweet meaning, silently invited The frequent kiss. Valdemar. May all the powers of Hell Blast thy vile tongue! Osmond. O rapture-giving hours! When mingling soul with soul, and breast to breast Beating responsive pleasure! Hours of transport! Urge the slow wing of time, and to my bosom Restore my Lena. Valdemar. By the Gods of Norway I will not wait the slow formalities That custom has assign'd the combatâInsult Like this demands immediate chastisement. [draws. Ostan. 'Tis as I wish'd. (draws.) Valdemar. Sword of my father now Be faithfulâ [They fight: the sword of Valdemar is broke. âCurses on thy shivering blade! Ostan. Replace thy sword. Valdemar. [Snatching a dagger from his bosom, plunges it into the breast of Ostan.] This shall replace it. Ostan. [Making a thrust at Valdemar misses him, and falls. Coward! O villain-handed slave. Valdemar. [Smiling over him. Stay; live good Chief, Tell me where I shall find the Queen of Norway, And she shall once again partake thy flight. Ostan. Is she not in thy power? By Heaven, that thought Revives meâYet, Berino!âOh!âRevenge! (Dies. Valdemar. No! that is mineâI live, I live to feel it. The vaunting heroe, the rapacious loverâ Pale, pale he liesâO for ten thousand daggers Sped with like vengeance to each Danish heart, 'Till all her yellow-tressed sons shall shrink At the Norwegian crest, and all her daughters Weep o'er the graves of lovers!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. An area in the centre of a deep grove. Asmond, Lena. Asmond. Deep in the centre of this solemn grove Repose the royal ancestry of Denmark. And where that tall pine spreads it's guardian shade, My lov'd Arvina restsâ Lena. [Kneeling over the grave. O let me bathe With many a duteous tear the cold, cold earth That hides the buried parent! Dear remains! O honour'd ashes! have ye no kind spark, No conscious spark of life, which sleeping yet The breath of filial fondness might awake! Asmond. Cease, child! This tenderness renews my sorrows. Lena. How can I cease? For was not I the cause, The wretched causeâ Asmond. Of misery past redressâ Lena. [Sill kneeling and looking on the grave. O Princess! Parent, whose heart-breaking Love Led thee untimely to these seats of Death, Look thro' the veil of everlasting night, And view thy hapless daughter! View her!ânoâ For thou art innocent, and the fair flower Springs pleasantly upon thy graveâTo seeâ In thy own offspring to behold a wretch, A guilty wretch! Thy spirit would recoil And seek once more a refuge in the Dust. Asmond. Guilty! O horror!âO my blind affection! Yes, thou art guiltyâhast thou not disgrac'd Thy royal lineage? Hast thou not foregone Each claim to virtue in a subject's arms? Lena. Thou gav'st me life; thou only may'st resume The fatal giftâAnd shall thy sword delay? Have I not been the cause of every woe That wounds thy honest heart? Look on that grave! Did I not rob thee of the gentle breast That lies unconscious thereâ Asmond. Why wilt thou rend My soul? Lena. Was I not yielded to the arms Of Denmark's hated foe? Has he not triumph'd O'er Asmond, greatly triumph'd in his daughter? And shall the object that has brought upon thee Disgrace and misery live? Asmond. Thou art my child!â Lena. Hast thou forgot that I'm a fugitive, A guilty fugitive? Led by weak love Of Ostan, have I not brought infamy On Denmark's royal race? Asmond. By mighty Thor! That, that is insupportable, and thou Must fall a victim to thy hapless fate, And wretched follyâThou must dieâ Lena. I thank youâ Asmond. A living instance of disgrace to Denmark! Thy King, thy Father! By our guardian Gods; That is not to be borneâ Lena. O best of parents! Asmond. What wouldst thou say? Thou wouldst not wish for life. Lena. For misery? No! 'Twould be unnatural For me to wish, unkind for you to grant. To give me death will be a father's giftâ Asmond. Dreadful alternative! Thou must not fall By vulgar handsâAnd shall a parent's armâ O feebleness of heart! Lena. Then, should the arms Of Valdemar prevail; to swell his triumph, To soothe his pride, and satiate his revenge, Asmond will yield his daughterâ Asmond. Wretched woman! How dost thou urge thy fate! Tho' my heart fears not For Denmark's causeâyet should the chance of war To Valdemar restore theeâHorror! horror Is in the thoughtâCanst thou behold this dagger? Or is it's keen and shining point more dreadful Than such a dire event?â Lena. Thou seest me firmâ Why wilt thou thus delay? Asmond. Arvina's eye Arrests my lingering hand. Lena. Ah me! my father! What dost thou see? Asmond. Beware! nor call me fatherâ The needful purpose shrinks within my breastâ Even now it shrinks, while in her daughter's eye I meet my lost Arvinaâ Lena. Hide it tearsâ Conceal the vain resemblanceâ Asmond. (Embracing her.) Oh! my daughter! Still, still my child! tho' misery and misfortune Are in thy trainâ Lena. And infamy, and guilt. Asmond. In vain, ill-fated woman, wouldst thou urge Thy wretched father's hand against thy life. While all the powers of nature and affection In their strong cords restrain itâO'er that grave, Arvina's hovering Spirit seems to frown, Indignant of the dire intentâFarewell! The trumpet's sound proclaims th'approaching battle, And one short hour decides the fate of Denmark. Should Norway's arms succeed, we have no choice Save what a friend like this affordsâ [Throws down a dagger. SCENE II. Lena. [Taking up the dagger. Then come, Cold and insensible, but honest friend! From rending grief, from rude-assailing cares, From shame's quick pang, and from the quiver'd eye Of the sell archer, Scorn, thy friendship saves. And shall I then delay to yield admission To such a guardian guest? Shall I refuse My bosom to a friend who kindly offers Such happy privilege? SCENE III. Lena, Lother. Lother. Art thou the Queen of Norway? Lena. Chief of Denmark, Whoe'er thou art, forego such vain enquiries, And instantly withdrawâ Lother. O yes, the same! Dear, hapless woman, drop that fatal weapon. And meet my first, my fond embraceâ Lena. Rash youth, Intruding stranger, henceâ Lother. I am no strangerâ Embrace thy brother! Lena. [Letting fall the dagger. Hah! Lother. The son of Asmondâ Lena. O my torn heart! a brother! sure I know not A sister's love, I cannot be a sisterâ Yet, if thou art my brother, gentle youth, Then I will weep for theeâ Lother. O let me hold A sister to my heart! Lena. Fond youth, forbear; Embrace not miseryâ Lother. My lost, lov'd sister, welcome to my breast! Lena. Thou hast no sister; and I have no brother, No father, and no friendâI stand alone The property of woe, the hapless victim Of cruel Fate and Follyâ Lother. Cherish hope: For by the holy verdure of this grave, Where sleeps our tender mother, thou shalt be My sister stillâAnd thou, O parent, hear This duteous vowâMine eye shall never rest, 'Till vengeance reach the cause of each misfortune That waits thy hapless daughterâ Lena. Kind in vain! Let us no longer stain with idle tears These flowers that spring upon the honour'd dust Of Denmark's Princess. Lother. Let me then conduct thee To some less gloomy scene, where grief collects not Fresh horrors from congenial shades and silence. Lena. Leave me, good Prince! these melancholy bounds, These regions of forgetfulness and death Are the fit walks of sorrowâDo not now The cares of war await thee? Lother. But to see, And to embrace a sister, never seen, Never before embrac'd, I stole one moment From the approaching battleâValdemar Already riots on revenge, and feeds High dreams of victory, since Ostan fell Beneath his single armâFarewell my sister! Fear not that vengeance shall repay his rapine, Live and encourage hopeâ [Takes up the dagger as he goes off. SCENE IV. Lena. Is Ostan fall'n? Ill-fated youth! I should have griev'd for Ostan, Had not distress and terror steel'd my heart To every soft affectionâHe was braveâ He lov'd his friendâHe lov'dâAh guilt and ruin! Ill-fated youth to fall by Valdemar! And glut his fell revenge! Yet may not I Find the same horrid fate? NoâWhere's my friend, Where is my father's gift? Tho' 'twere a dagger, It was his daughter's portionâyet his son Has robb'd her of itâBut I must not lose it. [Exit, in pursuit of Lother. SCENE V. Berino, Avilda. Berino. This hour is pinion'd with the eagle's plume, Danger and glory dwell upon it's wing, And every new stroke wafts a sacrifice, To the fair shrine of honourâgenerous princess, Whose favour is the glory of my life, My soul's first pride and treasureâsay, what cause Withholds me now from the united force Of Denmark? Am I then unworthy deem'd, Once a deserter from my honour'd country, To aid her arms, or join her just revenge? Avilda. Forget, brave youth, what never would employ One memory save your ownâCare, only care Of your distinguish'd lifeâBelov'd by Lother, Esteem'd by Asmond, honour'd by Canute, Avilda's friendship, following the regard Of Denmark's princes would consult your safety. Berino. The blazing sceptre, the high-waving plume Of conquering valour, the full glow of joy That flushes o'er the cheek of victory, Have no charm equal to that tender care, That condescending kindnessâ Avilda. Then avoid The fate of Ostan; nor oppose thine arm Singly against the sword of Valdemar, But wait the chance of battleâ Berino. Ostan's fate! Avilda. Is now determin'dâ Berino. By th'eternal gods, It must notâshall not beâmy friend, my friend, My Ostan is not fallen. Avilda. Unwillingly I'd bear unwelcome tidings, did not hope That gentle pity might relieve the pain Of wounded friendshipâdid not flattering hope That I might sooth it's anguish, and restrain Th'incautious hand of self-expos'd revenge, Prevail o'er other motivesâ Berino. Oh! Revenge! Even now delay'd too long! Dear, fallen friend, Dost thou not now reproach me? Dost thou not With cold disdain behold my loitering sword, And blast my tardy hand with all the curses That wait on broken faith? Princess farewell, A few lost moments more may take for ever The means of vengeance from me. Avilda. Lost, indeed, The moments you devote to me, and lost Those cares and gentle offices of love. Which idly hold you here.â Berino. Sounds, sounds of magic! Enchantments! Dreams! Delude not my lost senses! LoveâDid not loveâ Avilda. The word unguarded fellâ Yet were there magic in the sound of power Thy too impetuous valour to restrain, And hold thee from the deathful field, perhaps I would not now recall it. Berino. Prostrate see That gratitude, which language cannot speak! The joy, the hope of long-extended days Bursting in beams of transport on my soul, It's feebler lights oppressâFor ever hereâ Here let me dwell, the willing slave of love, No other passion shall dispute the empire Of my devoted heartâNo other guest, Save friendship, find admittance, fair Avilda, You will permit me still to love my friendâ Permit, my Ostan, while he lives, to share My due affectionâ Avilda. Favourable error! Would it might last! Berino. Permit my OstanâHah! Horror and death! where has delirious fancy With idle dreams seduc'd meâpale he liesâ My friend, my gallant friend, yet unreveng'dâ While I, in luxury of hope and love, Consume the vacant hourâO injur'd shade! Neglected truth and honour! SCENE VI. Avilda, Berino, Lother. Lother. Valiant Chief! Shall thy hand loiter, while thy bleeding country Demands it's instant aid? The troops of Norway With rapid fury press toward the palace. Already have they broke the lines led on By our brave Sovereign; who the shock sustaining With too adventurous and determin'd valour, Beyond his weight of years, by cruel chance Is now their prisonerâ Avilda. My aged father! Ah wretched, lost Avilda! 'Twas to theeâ To thee this fatal accident was owing, When all misplac'd thy foolish fears withheld Berino from the battle; let me fly, For guilt is in my presenceâ SCENE VII. Lother, Berino. Lother. More successful, The Prince, my father, leads his valiant Danes Against the lines of ValdemarâTo you He gives the charge of those receding troops First headed by the KingâHe bids you rally The scatter'd force, and at the least sustain The shew of some resistanceâ Berino. Am I worthy Of such distinguish'd honourâCoward shame, Burn, burn not on my cheekâPrince I attend you. SCENE VIII. Valdemar, Norwegian Officers. Valdemar. Vengeance! O traitrous vengeance! thy own throne, Thy temple was the heart of Valdemarâ There thou wert worship'd with unwearied prayer, Yet, like a faithless DÃ¦mon as thou art, Hast thou betray'd himâCurse the frigid souls Of those Norwegian slaves, who basely fled Before the smooth-hair'd DaneâFirm as the pine On their own blasted mountains have they stood When rapine urg'd their sordid armsâbut oh! When great revenge, when wounded honour call'd, How shrunk their dastard souls! Now all is lost! And but one glimpse of vengeance yet remains, One curs'd dear hope to soothe my stormy soul! Fly, search, my friends, around these winding shades, For here by sure intelligence I find The Queen of Norway's hidâif fortune yield That fair, that faithless Dane once to my power, Here, in this grove, whose sacred horror shades The Gods of Denmark; whose old arms surround Her Father's palace, and desend the graves Of all her Ancestors, here shall she fallâ Yet not 'till satiate with delightful insult, Ingenious vengeance wrings her tortur'd soul With more than Death's own bitterness; nor then, 'Till flush'd with conquest, insolent with triumph, Th'unconscious Asmond shall returnâBy Thor, By mighty Thor, the thought is worth my kingdom. Oh! when elate with victory he comes, Then, at that glorious hour, before his eyes, Before her father's eyes, then will I plunge My poynard to her heart; and o'er the body, Say, with a smile, Asmond, behold thy daughter! Officer. My royal Lordâ Valdemar. Slave! hast thou seen a Dane? Art thou too a Norwegian? Coward fear Dwells on thy cheekâ Officer. I've seen the Queen of Norwayâ Valdemar. And she has made thee trembleâin one moment Let me behold herâ Officer. She isâ Valdemar. In one momentâ [Officer departs and immediately returns with other officers, bringing the dead body of the Queen of Norway. She faints with fearâSupport herâ Officer. My dread Lord! Near to the Queen we found this dagger red With recent stainsâMore of her death we know not. Valdemar. Distraction! death! off execrable slaves! By Earth, and Heaven and Hell she shall not dieâ O fled, fled, fled from my revengeânow fortune, Now I will curse thee; and thou feeble Odin, Thou helpless founder of my wretched race, O for the lightning's swiftest beam to blast thee On thy dishonour'd throne! SCENE IX. Valdemar, Asmond. [Attended by Danish soldiers who seize and carry off the attendants of Valdemar. Asmond. Oh! yes, 'tis o'erâ There the poor victim liesâill-fated child, Farewell! Valdemar. Perdition on thy heart! thy child! 'Tis true the traitress was thy childâShe wasâ And worthy such a fatherâbut I hop'd That information which would rend thy soul, Might be reserv'd for meâ Asmond. Norwegian! Hah! Audacious foe, who art thouâ Valdemar. Thou wilt die With fear to knowâ Asmond. The King of Norwayânoâ Tho' all the storm-nurs'd savages that range O'er thy wild hills, and howl for human blood; Tho' the dark fiends, that shake the reeling earth And breathe blue pestilence; tho' Hell itself Holds not a heart so horrid, I rejoice To meet thee hereâ Valdemar. Asmond, behold thy daughter! Asmond. [Beckoning to his attendants to remove the body of Lena. Thy power of villainy is spent, but tell me If by thy cursed hand the victim fellâ Valdemar. That I could wish to tell theeâ Asmond. 'Tis enoughâ For the base motives of thy hellish rapine I ask thee notâ Valdemar. And, therefore, thou shalt know themâ In the records of Norway still subsists An ancient prophecy, that when her Monarch Espous'd the daughter of a Prince of Denmark The crowns should be unitedâEndless discord Between the rival kingdoms still prevented A friendly contractâbut whate'er my means, Ambition was my motiveâGreat ambition To reign o'er thee and DenmarkâYet thou prophet, Thou false, insidious prophet! could I find Thy execrable dustâthe rapid winds Should rend each sleeping atom!â Asmond. False he was notâ Henceforth the Crowns of Denmark and of Norway Shall be unitedâWouldst thou not be witness To that event? then render to my sword The life thou long hast ow'd itâ Valdemar. [Draws: they fight: Valdemar falls. Gods of Norway! Am I prevented? Asmond. The sure hand of justice Has sped the blow, and I am satisfied. SCENE X. Canute, Asmond, Lother, Berino. Asmond. My royal father too return'd in safety! The Gods are gracious. Canute. Are these sacred shades Defil'd with slaughter? Or is this the body Of some brave friend? Asmond. 'Twas once the King of Norwayâ Canute. Ha! Asmond. Here he hop'd to find the hapless Lena, And glut his savage vengeance, but in death She first had taken refugeâTo my sword He yieldsâthis moment, yields his forfeit life. Canute. Tho' 'twas thy due, I envy thee the blow, By which the ruffian fell.âAt last, my son, Our conquest is completeâand tho' 'tis bought With one devoted life of Denmark's race, More lasting peace will followâNorway's now A province of our own: for the whole forc Of Valdemar was spent in this invasion. Much honour, many thanks, my gallant sons, Await your valiant deeds; and this brave Chief. Whose timely aid and animating spirit Recall'd the scatter'd troops, and rescued me From short captivityâWhat meed is due To such distinguish'd worth? Asmond. Might I determineâ Make him your viceroy on the throne of Norway, And let the fair Avilda, whose affection He long hath won, be his associate there. Canute. Thou art a liberal giver, but thy bounty I will not now restrain. Berino. O let me offer My truest, humblest duty! Lother. Be it mine To bear the grateful message to Avilda! Be Lother's meed to make, or to behold The happiness of others! Canute. Thou, my Asmond, Alone, art to be pitiedâHad Misfortune, With all her train, pursued thy hapless offspring, She might have been preserv'dâbut guilt prevented: The stings of Guilt wound deeper than Misfortune. Yet let the merits of thy own good heart Defend thee from distressâthe shield of Virtue Alike should save the bosom that it shades From inward sufferings and from outward evils. THE END.</field>
