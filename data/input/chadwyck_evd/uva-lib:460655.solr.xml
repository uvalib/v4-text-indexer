      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. âThe Grecian Camp before Troy. The Greek Commanders assembled in Council, i. e., Agamemnon, Menelaus, Achilles, Diomed, Nestor, Patroclus, Ulysses, Ajax. Aga. Chieftains of Greece, the objects of this meeting Are too proverbial to demand repeating. When Greek meets Greek we all know what 'tis for, In proof of which here comes the tug of war. A galley enters, containing Chryses, rowed by Attendants, with gifts, &amp;c. He leaps ashore in an excited manner. Chrys. I want my child. Ajax. You want your head punch'd, rather. Aga. Who are you, friend? Chrys. An injured father. Ajax. Then, if you've sons as bounceable as you, Send them but here, and they'll get injured too. Aga. Ajax, oblige me. Stranger, you complain. Ajax. Does he, by Jove? Aga. May I request again? Chrys. Where is my child? Aga. Who is your child? Chrys. Chryseis. Aga. Our servant-girl. How do I know where she is? Occupied in her kitchen, I presume, Practising social science after Broom, Or learning tasks of neatness and propriety Out of the pail of civilised society. Chrys. May not her aged father see her? Aga. Well, Had that connection rung the area bell, Or left the business he has come about Till the young person's usual Sunday out, He might have gain'd his wish; but, as it is, he Wants pulling down a peg or two. The girl is busy, And can't be spared: we've company to dine. Besides, in large establishments like mine, The serving maids no followers receive. Chrys. Then, if you've no objection, sir, she'll leave. Aga. Leave! Chrys. Yes; I'll take her home this very morning. Aga. Gammon! She hasn't even given warning; Or if she had, with her I wouldn't part. The girl's a perfect treasureâactive, smart (A prettier-spoken wench has not existence), And keeps the baker at a proper distance. Chrys. We miss her dreadfully at home. Aga. No doubt. Chrys. Her aged motherâ Aga. Knows, of course, she's out At service, and provided for by us. You've heard our alternativeâno more fuss; And if another plaint our soul enrages, We'll stop the insult from your daughter's wages. Chrys. What, then, Chryseis is? Aga. A slave, and ours! Chrys. My child a base Greek's slaveâ Ajax [wrathfully]. O Hiram Powers! I must attend this case; the patient's worse. [Agamemnon holds him back. Chrys. [stifling his rage]. Bright PhÅbus, are these people worth a curse? I think they are, and mean to give them one. Child of Latona! everybody's sun! Upon these beauteous bays and lovely creeks, And these extremely ugly coves, the Greeks, Let fall your heaviest beams; of all their heads Stave the flat roofs in, and melt all the leads. Give it them hot, for stealing your priest's daughter. Keep them perpetually in boiling water, With lots of toast for nothing (they can find tea). Ask your friend Mercury to stand at ninety On the thermometer. To help the crisis, Bid all the gods assist, excepting Isis. Let Mars, turn'd tailor, send, by Neptune's boats, Some nice hot clothing, such as scarlet coats, With leathern stocks incapable of crease, And helmets weighing half a ton apiece. Then prompt the fiery Hector, with his lot, To come and strike their iron while it's hot. Like hornets cursed, with fire and brimstone storm them. PhÅbus, Apollo, in two brief words, WARM THEM! [Rushes out frantically L. Greeks look as if it had suddenly turned very hot. They fan themselves, &amp;c. Achilles rises. He has been concealed from the rest hitherto. Comes forward, fanning himself with pocket-handkerchief. Patroclus comes forward, also exactly imitating the gestures of Achilles, whom he copies, in a feeble manner, upon all occasions. N.B.âAchilles is magnificently dressed in the style of a Greek guardsman. Patroclus is a little vulgar gent. Achilles. I rise to say I thinkâ [Seeing Patroclus imitating. [Annoyed]. Patroclus, don't. Patro. [abjectly]. What? Think? Achilles. No; imitate me. Patro. [crestfallen]. Then I won't. [Retires a little, watching Achilles with hopeless admiration. [Aside.] Oh, if I only could! There's trousers! My! Achilles. Since my opinion you solicit, why, The meeting I submissively inform That it's extremely hot. [Fans himself. Patro. [imitating]. Extremely warm! Achilles [turning on him angrily]. Patroclus! cease this plagiarism employing: It may be flatteringâits d?d annoying. I can't invent a collar or a trouser, But this man watches me like any mouser, To pounce on my ideah. Confound the fellah! My last creationâthe thin silk umbrellaâ He vulgarised by a most coarse translation, And on the very day of publication. Two things I'm safe againstâthe pigmy frisker!â He can't well copy me in height or whisker. [Fans himself.] By Jove, if this goes on I shall expire. Aga. I'm melting. Mene. I'm half roasted. Dio. I'm on fire. SONGâHot Codlings. Dio. I'm a military man, and have service seen a lot, But was never under fire half so hot, hot, hot. Aga. Though in Phrygia I feel, if the heat doesn't cease, I shall speedily die in a state of native Grease. Ach. If the weather doesn't change I shall cut war's cares, And go home uponâ[Spoken.] Eh? [Looks round.] Dio. [Spoken]. Sick leave? Aga. [Spoken]. Half-pay? Mene. [Spoken]. Exchange? Nestor. [Spoken]. I have itâupon âUrgent private affairs.â Omnes. Tol, ol, &amp;c. &amp;c. Enter Teucer, terrified, but languid. Teucer. Horror! the dogs of war, Ponto and Toby, Have fallen victims to the hydrophoby. Aga. What proof have ye? Teucer. Thisâthey refuse to drink Scamander's waters. Aga. In that case I think, From certain perfumes that assail my nose, Those dogs are not so mad as you suppose. Dio. The river, too! Another foeman grim! Ajax. Oh, he be smoked! I'll soon walk into him. [Makes sign as of tucking up his trousers, and runs to R., where he meets a Greek with a black face, who enters. Ajax. The devil damn the black! I won't be chaff'd. Greek. It isn't my fault; I've been photograph'd. [Sensation of horror. PhÅbus has sent, our energies to damp, A plague of photographers in the camp. [General horror. They swarm like flies from sugar casks exuded, And black your face for twopence, frame included; And if you don't exterminate them fast, To this complexion you must come at last. Enter Talthybius, fanning himself. Tal. Chieftains, we've caught a spy. Aga. Who cares, you fool? Tal. You'd like to see himâhe's so nice and cool. Aga. Cool! Show him in at once. Jove, what a treat! Mene. Those Trojans go to win in any heat If fiery Hector urges them to action. Tal. This person seems a Tartar by extraction. Dio. Tartar! How so? Tal. They tried to bring him on: He wouldn't come. The best thing to be done, They thought, in that caseânot to let it fret them, But come without him. Aga. Well? Tal. He wouldn't let them. Ajax. I see I'm wanted. [Exit R. Aga. How was it they found him? Tal. Writing on horseback calmly. Though around him Showers of arrows, darts, and stones were blinding, He kept on taking notes, and never minding. Though by death menaced, he would not look solemn: He said his capture would make half a column. Though swords were at his throat, as red as poppy, He laugh'd and said, 'twould all come in as copy. Dio. What could he mean? Achilles. Man must be mad! Patro. [imitating Achilles' manner]. A hass! Achilles [turning round with a lordly gesture of anger]. Patroclus! Patro. [shrinks away, looking at Achilles.] Oh, mong deu! kill air, kil grace! [Sighs. Re-enter Ajax, dragging in Homer. The latter is splendidly dressed; his tunic, helmet, &amp;c., stuck all over with arrows, which he picks out and throws away during his early speeches. He has a telescope slung to his back, and carries an open note-book and pencil. Ajax. Just step this wayâ Homer [freeing himself]. Hands off, unless your crimes You'd have reported to the latest Times. Aggy, how do? Mene. Surely a maniac this is. Stranger. Is that you, Menelaus? How's the missis? Achilles. I say, remember where you show your face. Stranger. Take care, Achilles; I know your weak place. [Points to his heel. Dio. [drawing sword]. Cut the slave down! [A rush at him. Stranger [coolly]. Think twice. Before you sup You'll all be trembling lest I cut you up. Your fames are in my hands, premium or zero, Whether each ranks a humbug or a hero. Aga. What are you, fellow? Stranger. A descriptive bard, Clever at battle-pieces. There's my card. [Gives card to Agamemnon, who looks at it, and appears at first astonished, then amazed and incredulous. Aga. [laughing]. Surely this title must be a misnomer. You don't mean seriously to say you're Homer? [At the mention of Homer's name all take off their caps, and assume a sudden air of deference. Homer. And if I said it seriously, why doubt me? Because I laugh, and have my eyes about me; Wear a whole coat, and what's-their-names complete; And look as if I had enough to eat? Methinks I understand the sort of thing. You fain would see a bard, most noble king: A sightless beggar, tottering and weak, With limbs decrepit, and furrowed cheek (His pow'r might make him dangerous otherwise); Blind, for you might not like to see his eyes; Of dismal countenance, morose, and tearful, Knowing you've not done much to make him cheerful; Hungry, that famine may from speech prevent him. Thus would you have court painters represent him; And so, no doubt, the world will picture me, The plump, gay, jolly gentleman you see. SONG. A monarch I serve, and I am his liegeâ PhÅbus Apollo, the Sun, Who has sent me to write an account of this siege, Long enough since begun. I'm to send him reports to Parnassus by post Of your doings, and those of the opposite host, In a dashing, Splashing, Vividly flashing, Tusselly, Muscle-y, Bold Billy Russell-y, Graphical style of fun. And I may be of use in another guess way. Damme, they'll never get on If I don't help 'em out by explaining the play Chorusy, glibly done. To begin, you shall hear from great Homer's own lips His catalogue famous of heroes and ships, With their glittering masses, Horse-tail'd brasses, Jolly floss, Polly floss, boy o'the lasses. Mem! [Stops and writes in note-book. That shall go in Book One. [Singles the chieftains out one by one. Those are the brothers Atrides so great, Mighty King Aga-mem-non, And famed Menelaus, a check of whose mate Made this odd game begun. To remind him of Helen is rather unkind; But on new Paris fashions she would set her mind, Which are mostly Costly, Greedy, Bleedy, Ruinous stewing us, Wholly undoing us, Bankruptcy kind of fun. This is Achilles, the swift and the strong, Heaven-born Thetis' son; Though a pretty good height, he is not to live longâ [Looking up at him. Achilles looks terrified. Longer than eight feet one. [Achilles looks re-assured. Homer collars Patroclus. And this is Patroclus, a myrmidon snob, [Patroclus indignant. Who, though cribbing his suit, will get one for his nob From the Trojan hammerer, Paviour's rammerer, Dare-ified, Rarified, Force-taming, Horse-taming, Hectoring son of a gun. [Alarm of Patroclus. Achilles consoles him. He beckons Ulysses, who comes forward with conciliatory bows to him. This is Ulysses, the wisest on earth, Ithaca's cautious son; That is, by adoptionâthe place of his birth Isâ Ulys. [interrupts him in alarm]. Hang it, mon, dinna let on! Homer. Well, he'd not like it knownâyou'll observe, by the way, He has not the least accent the truth to betray, Of his Grampian, Trampian, Hoot away, Foot away, Porridging, Foraging, Auld Reikie origin. [Ulysses looks at him imploringly. Homer correcting himself kindly,â Modern Athenian one. But I really can't stop to describe you the rest; Copy has got to be done. [To Agam.] By the way, if you're anxious to ward off a pest, Sent by Apollo the Sun, You'll return the fair daughter you stole from his priest. Though you made her a booty, don't you be a beast, Or this roast timeâ [Looks at watch. Ghost, I'm If it ain't post time! I must be running. An article stunning I've promised for Number One. [Exit. Dio. He left me out. Must I be in the ruck? Ajax. He didn't mention meâhe hadn't pluck. Achilles [rises: business of Patroclus doing the same, and being snubbed by a look]. After an oracle of such authority Of course our chairman bows to the majority, And yields the captive whom the foe demands. Ajax. [squaring at Agamemnon]. If not, we'll settle it by show of hands. Voices. Chair! Order! Spoke! Be quiet! Ajax [subdued: hustled to his place]. Well, I'll try. [Aside, looking at his clenched fist. Just wait till I can catch the speaker's eye! Aga. Prince [aside, looking at Achilles], that puppy's laughing in his sleeve. The crown foregoes its claimâour slave shall leave. Achilles [laughs]. Ha! ha! Aga. May Iâto waive our slight disparity Of stationâask the cause of that hilarity? Achilles. I was just thinking how you'd do without Chryseis in your bad attacks of gout. Aga. Gout! [He draws his sword, and is about to rush on Achilles. Diomed and Menelaus hold him back. Achilles. No one else, you say, can make your sago. [Agamemnon struggles to get at him. Achilles stands twirling his moustache carelessly. Ulys. [to Achilles]. Apologise for âgout.â Achilles [laughing]. Well, then, lumbago. Aga. [newly incensed: held back]. Release me! Ajax. Peace, Atrides, I implore you. Rather than see a row, I'll lick him for you. Aga. Get out! Achilles. Don't stop him. [Nestor rises from his seat; all bow respectfully to him; Agamemnon lowers his sword; Achilles, about to draw, desists. Nestor. Gentlemen and kings, I recollect a quantity of things; But the renown which gilds my life's December Grows from things good and bad I don't remember. So when your acts are tinged with base or shabby taints, You just consult the oldest of inhabitants. SONG. AirâThe Cheshire Man and the Spaniard. I recollect men drawing swords Without quite knowing why; I don't remember their angry words, Or blows they gain'd much by. I recollect how thoughtless jokes Have laid great houses flat; But how it profitted the folks, I don't remember that. [Ulysses and Diomed lead him back to his seat. Aga. [aside]. Gentlemen, I need not say I feel Extremely anxious for the public weal, Which I'm convinced Achilles was but joking When, inconsid'rately, he put his spoke in. I yield Chryseis, but on this condition: As I'm the leader of this expedition, And as the common cause requires that I Should find my coffee hot, my slippers dry, After each battle, for such parlour small work I'll take, instead, Achilles' maid of all work, BrisÃ«isâ Achilles [horrified]. What? Aga. I rather think she'll suit; At any rate, I'll try her. Achilles. Here's a brute! Thou monster mixed ofâ [Draws sword, and is about to rush on Agamemnon, when, realising Flaxman's picture, Minerva rises (trap) at his elbow, and arrests the blow. Min. Treat it as a joke. Achilles. Surely that was the voice of Wisdom spoke. Min. 'Tis Wisdom's self, unseen by all save you. Make fun of everything this evening through: Treat all that happens in facetious fashion. Achilles. At least allow me to get in a passion. Min. Do that, of course: how else can Homer sing Achilles' wrath to Greece the direful spring? Et cÃ¦tera and so forth. [Exit R. Patro. [at the wing R., imitating the threatening gestures of Achilles]. Yes, learn, fierce Argives, though from fears exemptâ [Achilles returns, and seizes him by the nape of the neck. Achilles. Patroclus, don't bring me into contempt. Ulys. I seldom speak, lest they should find me out; But, from these princes' quarrel, I've no doubt I shall gain keudosâthat's a braw Greek word, Aiblins as weel pronounced as e'er 'twas heard. Achilles' rage withdraws him from the nationâ That will assist my new bit speculation. Ye may na ken the scheme my wit to try hath on: I've built a slick horseâca'd it the Leviathan. It's varra large, well fetlock'd, brawly waunchit. [Pauses.] We've found it rather difficult to launch it. Hech! dinna fash yourselves, we'll move it yet. But then there'll be the passengers to get; And, till then, where to gang to? I'll employ That monster steed to run 'twixt here and Troyâ A deed to fire the bards of Greece and Rome Unborn; which, having done, I'll jistâ Min. [coming forward, and seizing him by the wrist]. Go home! Ulys. [falling on his knees before her]. Dinna say that! Min. 'Tis Jove's decree, ne'er doubt it. Ulys. Weel, then, I'll just take pretty long about it.

Enter Cupid [R.], wheeling a knife-grinding machine, with a tinker's apron, and a patch over his eye. Cupid. Any bright eyes to mind, crack'd hearts to mend, Love-locks to pick, obdurate wills to bend? Want any matches? Now's your time, my dears! Any old loves for new ones? There appears Not e'en a mermaid's head the waves above, To come and listen to the voice of love. But yet I'll exercise it; for the fact is, I've a new part to play, and ought to practise. SONG. AirâChevy Chase. It was a simple shepherd prince Saw tripping o'er the lea Some ladies fair; he counted them, And found they number'd three. The first of these was Juno proud, The wife of Jupiâter; The next Minerva, golden-brow'd; The third was my moâther. A golden pippin him theyâgave, Most beautiful toâview, Which he, untaught how to behave, Straightway began toâchew! They told him it was not to eat, But for a prize inâtended, For her of them he thought mostâsweet, Most beautiful andâsplendid. Says Juno, âGive to me theâprize, And wealth is yours andârule.â Said Pallas, âChoose me, and be wise, Or don't, and be aâfool.â But my mamma said, âYou this boon I promise for the pippinâ A beauteous wife.â I'd just as soon She'd promised me a whippin'. [Homer comes forward unseen, recognising Cupid. The voice of Wisdom cannot err; A fool he still reâmains; He took the wife, and blood through her Now drenches Ilion's plains. Homer [coming forward]. Whose wife, you rascal? Cupid [recognising Homer]. Ha! MÃ¦onides! Homer. Now, what do you want here? Cupid. Mum, if you please, As to my being even near the camp. Homer. Oh! honour amongstâ Cupid [taking his arm]. Men like us. Homer. You scamp! But say, what rogueries this way impel you? Cupid. Close that suspicious note-book, and I'll tell you. Homer. Will that do? Now, your news. Cupid. Oh! the old story. Venus likes Mars, but grudges him his glory. There's too much fighting, and too little kissing; For many of her fav'rite Trojans missing, To crush the war she has applied to this chief. Homer. What! all alone? Cupid. I've an ally named Mischief. Homer. I'll back the pair of you. Cupid [going L.]. Mind, no attention You call to me. Homer. Surely you'd like some mention In my new workâimpatiently awaited It's coming out in numbersâillustrated. Cupid. I want no puffing. Bless your heart, my boy, Love, the real author of the Siege of Troy, Will last you all outâyou, Pope, Shakspeare, Maro. Homer. Just hold your noise, and move on with your barrow. [Cupid moves his barrow to L. Music. Thetis is seen rising from the sea. DUET.âCupid and Homer. Cupid. See from ocean rising, Like mists of early day, From yon wave bright Thetis beams, Fairest of the Nereids, queen of the spray. Homer. More of this great event in a future number, Yet awhileâyet awhile; I can only say She's well worth admiring, Queen-like and gay. Cupid. My presence Troy requiring, I must away. [Exit Cupid, L. Homer retires to his hiding-place, taking notes. Achilles [R., outside]. Mamma! Thetis. That voice! Enter Achilles [R.]; Thetis runs to embrace him. My own sea dogâmy pet! Achilles. Yes; that'll do, mamma. You're rather wet. Thetis. Reproach'd by him with my moist origin! Shiver my timbers! Achilles. There, now, don't begin. I wish you'd raise your style of conversation More to the level of my earthly station. Sea phrases may at home be all quite well; But recollect I'm not an ocean swell. It's hard a grown man, by the seaside stopping, Cannot escape from the maternal Wapping, But must a mother recognise whom no man Can doubt for what she isâa bathing woman. Thetis [weeping]. And 'twas for this that him alive I drew Out of the Styxâhe was as cross as two. For this return I've watch'd his ev'ry whimâ From that height brought him up, and made of him So much as you perceive. Ungrateful son Of a sea-cookâ [Impatient gesture of Achilles. Forgive me, sweet; I've done. [Aside]. From e'en a word's reproach I ought to spare him, Since 'tis hard fate's decree I'm not to ârearâ him. What would my darling? Has his purse grown lank? Draw for what sum you like on ocean's bank Of trinkets, jewels: should you ask a heap, Thine are the shipwreck'd treasures of the deep. Anything in that line to give I'm able, From a pearl string to an Atlantic cable. Achilles. Jewels or gold, mamma, I come to claim none. Thetis. What then? Achilles. I want to serve out Agamemnon. Thetis. His crime? (My own sea-lawyer I'll employâ A shark of practice keen.) To vex my boy What has he dared? Achilles [blubbering]. Heâheâ Thetis. Take, I entreat, heart. Achilles [bursting into tears]. He call'd me out of names, and stole my sweetheart. Thetis. He surely could not dare toâ? Achilles. But he could. Thetis. Then I'll tell Jupiter. Achilles. I wish you would. And ask him for at least some months or weeks To help the Trojans and annoy the Greeks. Thetis. My hero-child, I swear it shall be done. Achilles [going R.]. Oh! then that's all I want. Good-by. Thetis. My son, Is't thus you leave me? Achilles [stops, reflecting]. Well, since you inquire, No, ma, there's nothing else that I desire. Of what I next want duly I'll informâ Thetis. My child, Achilles! are you wrapp'd up warm? [Exit Achilles, L. He's cross'd in loveâto harass him were wrong. Spite of his looks, poor dear! he isn't strong. Yet Destiny's decree I still might foil, Could I but make him take cod-liver oil. Homer [coming forward]. If I intrude, your pardon don't refuse it. Thetis [graciously]. Sir, if you do, your manners quite excuse it. Homer. A journey to Olympus you intend? Thetis. I do. Homer. Pray could you introduce a friend? Thetis. Sir, in Olympus mortal feet ne'er step did. Homer. I trust the public press may be excepted? [Gives her a card. Thetis. Oh, sir! in that case ev'ry rule breaks through. I shall feel quite enchanted.

Enter Juno, followed by Minerva. Juno [angrily]. How now? What brings that fisherwoman here? Jup. [aside]. Our jealous queen! She call'd, my love, to ask If we of oysters wanted a small cask; Likewise to mention turbot was in season. Juno. O watery pretence! Most washy reason! Jup. âWashy,â my dear? Juno. Ay, with the prefix âwishy.â Jup. [aside]. I fear the explanation did look fishy. Mind your own bus'ness, madam! Tut, go to! Do I command Olympus, or do you? Suppose, to please a faithful servant's boy, I have agreed to take the side of Troy, And havoc spread your fav'rite Greeks among? Don't answer me, ma'am! Silence! Hold your tongue!

No; yet from the ground Lifted I seem. Cupid a meeting grants. Hence these strange flutterings, and these new âpants!â After long months of obduracy strange, Over her bosom there has come a change. How about my shirt front? All right, I think. Having brought me to desperation's brink, The darling soulâI hope she'll like my bootâ SeemsâHang it, she must smile upon this suit: I've had it made express for the occasion. Yes, the dear girl, long deaf to all persuasion, At length consents to take a walk with me, And crown our raptures with a cup of tea! Enter Cupid, disguised as Pandarus [L.]. Troi. Ha, Pandarus! Cupid. She's getting ready. [Aside to audience.] Mum! I have Sir Pandarus of Troy become, And by my side wear steel which he has felt, But my disguise's secret has not smelt. Troi. Will she be long, good Pandarus? Cupid. Why, no. She's a quick dresserâsay three hours or so. Troi. Oh, it will seem an age! Cupid. Wait till you see The wonderful results. Troi. Sweet coz, tell me What does she mean to wear? Cupid. Her maid ne'er blabs. I only know it came home in six cabs. But I'll go in and ascertain what progress. [Exit L. Troi. Troilus, how now? Is it a witch, or ogress, Or gentle Cressid you await? Be steady! Re-enter Cupid, leading Cressida. Cupid. Come on! Cressida [timidly]. I really couldn't. Troi. What, already! Now heaven walks on earth! Cupid. Come, Miss Demure, The prince won't bite. Cres. Oh, kinsman, are you sure? Cupid [putting her arm in that of Troilus]. There! Troi. [aside]. Bliss unhoped for! Cupid. Does it hurt? Cres. Not much. Troi. The thrilling rapture of those fingers' touch! Lady, you have bereft me of all words. Cupid. You, pretty pair of jolly green love-birds, At leisure, bill and coo, and leave to me The arduous task of seeing about tea. [Exit R. Troi. Cressid, how often have I wish'd me thus! Cres. Have you, my lord? Troi. O joy delirious! Those silver tones, more than War's brazen trumpets, Ring through my soul, and sayâ Cupid [re-entering]. Muffins or crumpets? Troi. Both.

What shouts are those disturb the peaceful camps? Enter Homer, running [L.]. Homer. Have you a wafer and eight postage stamps? Priam. No. Why? Homer. There's such a precious row below! Venus whisk'd Paris offâbut that you know. And that's not half. Minerva's play'd the deuce, By prompting Pandarus to break the truce. That party rashly let an arrow fly, And wounded Menelaus in the thigh. They're at it, tongs and hammer, tooth and nail; Hector is laying on them like a flail: Where'er he shows, the Greeks his prowess damps. My kingdom for a wafer and eight stamps! [Rushes out R.

[Exeunt omnes except Hector. Hector. Why stays Andromache when I expect her? I wonder what folks think of me as Hector. The name stands highâmost warlike ones below it; And shall it fall to-day? Not if I know it. For these dear walls, familiar to my sight, My ev'ry nerve and ev'ry ounce of fight I'll strain to stand, without defeat's alloy, This new and unforeseen attack on Troy. But see where comes, what checks with potent charm The jester's laugh, unnerves the warrior's arm. Enter Andromache [R.]. followed by a Nurse, with Astyanax in a pretty, classic-shaped perambulator. And. [embracing him]. My lord! Hector. Andromache! And. You are not hurt? Hector. Not even scratch'd, my darling. And. My desert Scarce merits this. This rapture after pain How many times may I enjoy again? Hector. Come, come! And. The bitter watching on the walls; The agony, as ev'ry helmet falls; The straining eyes with sick'ning film oppress'd, Afraid to see that 'tis my Hector's crest; The twilight joy I feel when once again Thy plumes I witness waving o'er the plain; The glare of bliss, oppressive as the sun To lidless eyes, when thee, my only one, I see returning scathless from the fightâ I cannot bear the darkness or the light. Leave me no moreâ Hector. Tut! And. Or a night will come, So long and dark! with even Hope's voice dumb To whisper that the sun will shine again, Or only speak to whisper it in vain. Leave me no more! Hector. What you! a soldier's wife! Is this the way to nerve me to the strife, When Greeks and gods their blows have 'gainst struck now? Be a real Trojanâthink yourself in Luck now, To own a husband who can fight for Troy. You haven't even let me kiss the boy. And. [presenting the child]. Doesn't he grow? [The child turns his head away. Hector. He scarcely grows polite. What! of his daddy can't he bear the sight, And. âThe babe clung, crying, to his nurse's breast, Scared by the dazzling plume and nodding crest.â He doesn't like that thing, nor Iâremove it. Hector. Since such distinguish'd judges disapprove it, Behold the evil floor'd! [Kisses the child, who this time submits. That's better, rather. Now let me talk to you, sir, as a father. Tread in my shoes. Of course, you'll wait a bit: At present they're in use, and wouldn't fit; But when they're yours, to keep them clean, with care Avoid the gutters, and walk on the square. Unbribed to learn your duty make a rule; That is, don't cry for halfpence going to school. Defend the little 'uns; bullies' threats despise; But, mind hit no one under your own size. Enjoy each holiday with cheerfulness, But never get yourself into a mess. To gain your class's head become a martyr, Not for the prize of ribbon, star, or garter, Or bust, slab, monument, which oft truth garbles (I hope my boy will never cheat at marbles); And when your task is done, your prayers are said, Like a good boy go cheerfully to bed. Follow rough Hector's ruleâyou'll need no otherâ To make you grow a manâbefore your mother. Enter Ãneas, wounded [L.]. Ãneas. You're wanted, quick. Hector. Ãneas, how now, stupid? Ãneas. Diomed's wounded me, my brother Cupid, (Disguised as Pand'rus), and our mother Venus. E'en Mars, who from his fury tried to screen us, He's sent home groaning from a dreadful stab. Hector. Away, then, with domestic weakness! Cab! [His chariot is brought in R.. Priam, Helen, Hecuba, Paris, Antenor, &amp;c., come in with it. And. Dear husband, go notâ Hecuba. Hector! Hector. Peace, mamma! Paris [eating, with a plate and champagne glass in his hand]. We've such a splendid pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras. Do stop and dine. Hector. O wretch! thy country's foe! Thy hate to Troy is this the time to show? Paris and Greece against us both conspire: To bake your pies our fat is in the fire. To oil a blade for fight too weak and narrow, A toy-shop beau that can't e'en shoot an arrow. Paris. Did you say beau? Hector. I did, my kinsman spruce, Regretting that I said itâto a goose. Paris. You quite invigorate a man, old chap! Pray, have you room for one inside your trap? Hector. What! do you mean it? Paris. Yes, I do. Hector [slaps him on back]. A trump! Helen. Paris, you'll hurt yourself! Mind how you jump! [Paris gets into chariot. Hector [pulls on gloves]. Give them their heads! Get all indoors again! Now Xanthus, Lampusâgood old horses then! Ãthon, Podargus, prove your gen'rous race. If e'er horse-taming Hector earn'd a place In your affections; if beyond his means He e'er indulged you in good wine-steep'd beans; If good warm stabling ye've enjoy'd of old, Give me to seize rich Nestor's shield of gold, And Diomed's arms by Vulcan's skill design'd, Paris, you muff, hold on! All right behind! [Drives off rapidly, L. The others follow cheering. Alarums. One or two large stones are thrown over the wall; an arrow sticks in the stage. Enter Homer [R.], writing calmly, an arrow in his helmet. Homer [writes]. âThe Greeks are throwing stonesââ [A large stone hits him; he catches it. I call that pleasant! [Goes to wall, and throws the stone back. âAnd so no more on that head just at present. The usual foresight of my gifted order Enables me to be the brief recorder Of what is going to happen. In a trice, This present hot work will both sides suffice: There'll be another truce before the night. Hector will challenge then, to single fight, The bravest Greek, to settle their dispute, The Greeks will then draw lots to see who'll suit. 'Twill fall on Ajaxâp'rhaps 'twill disconcert him; But, being strong, a lot more wouldn't hurt him. [Trumpet. Hah! signal for the truce. [Writes]. âThey've ceased to fight: Your correspondent was, as usual, right.â [Slow music. Wounded Trojans pass over the stage, L. to R. âThe wounded Trojans from the field return.â [To a wounded Soldier.] Your name, my friend? [The Trojan passes on with an impatient gesture. âAs yet I cannot learn The list of wounded; butââ [To another Trojan passing.] Sir, pardon meâ [The Trojan knocks him down and goes out R. âYour correspondent has not 'scaped scot free. [Muffled drums and a dead march. Aha! an ambulance this way proceeding! [Cupid is borne in on a litter, wounded. Cupid. Here's a sad go, old fellow! Love lies bleeding! Homer. Not kill'd, I hope, my pet? Cupid. You precious flat! Do you suppose that they could manage that? Love cannot die, but there are various things That may conspire to singe or break his wings. Homer. Love shouldn't fight. Cupid. A pretty phrase in writing; But Love, unfortunately, dotes on fighting. Yet, if rude knocks his tender skin annoy, Love changes into Hate. Homer. You naughty boy! I'll tell your mother. Cupid [angry]. How now, master poet? Whose servant, pray, are you? Homer. Love's slaveâI know it. Cupid. Then don't presume to answer your young master; Bridle your tongue, and let your legs move faster. Fetch Cressida. Homer. Anything else, great king? Cupid. Not for the moment. If there is I'll ring. [Exit Homer, R. Tremble, fierce Greeks! Love will his vengeance hurl, In the dread missile of a pretty girl. There, you may go; I'm rather more the thing; [To Attendants. At any rate, I'm well enough to sing. [Exeunt Attendants. SONG.âCupid. AirâThe Power of Love. âThere's a power whose sway,â &amp;c. [Retires. Enter Hector, Ãneas, Paris, and Diomed [L.]. Hector. Welcome to Troy, thou flow'r of Grecian virtue! And let me hope and trust I didn't hurt you. Dio. Not much. Hector. The next time, if preferr'd more hot, Pray don't say no, if you would rather not. Dio. [politely]. I won'târely upon it. But to businessâ Hector. Trueâ(pray excuse the rhyme)âexchange of prisoners. Calchas's child is sent for, I believe, [Aside]. If Cupid's word for aught one dares receive, And will be here anon. That other matterâ My challenge to the Greeksâ Dio. Sirânot to flatterâ Consider that fight won. Hector. You do me proud. Dio. The only Greek, by common voice allow'd, Great Hector's match in pluck, nerve, muscle, bulk, Is very ill. Hector. Dear me! His ailment? Dio. Sulk. Hector. A bad attack? Dio. Incurable, 'tis thought; So, in his absence, Ajax has been brought, At your superior hands, to seek disaster. Hector. It may prove Ajax AS good as his master. That fact one trial must decide; but see! Here comes your ransom'd prisoner. [Cupid slips round, stabs Diomed in the side with an arrow, and withdraws. Dio. [looking off R.]. Dear me! Homer enters [R.], bringing in Cressida, Troilus following. Homer. Now you must come. Troi. Divide us nothing shall. Hector. What! Troilus running after that there gal? Troi. Give me my Cressid! Hector. Yours? Troi. We are engaged. Hector. Pray, sir, where were you when the battle waged? Troi. At tea. Hector. With she? Troi. With her. Hector [restraining his rage]. Let's have no clamour! Troilus, you've ventured to asperse my grammar; But that's a trifle, scarce deserving heed: I'm in the army, and the Tenth don't read. Much more than thatâI find a soldier brave In war time turn'd a wench's milksop slave. Therefore, my Grecian friend, I've nought to say, Except instanter take that girl away! Enter Homer [L.], writing: his helmet is smashed, and his coat torn and covered with mud. Homer [writes]. âYour correspondent grieves to be complaining Of some ill-treatmentâAjax is in training. Your correspondent, wishing to know all, Was found conceal'd behind a sunken wall. Thinking he watch'd it to affect the betting, They gave to him a bonneting and wetting. Your correspondent therefore thinks it right Not to take any notice of the fight, Unlessââa happy thoughtââhe feels inclinedâ Inspire me, PhÅbusâha!ââto change his mind.â [Exit, writing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE V. âNear the Grecian Camp. Lists set out. Enter Patroclus [R.], meeting Menelaus [L.]. SONG.âTekeli. Patro. What does Achilles intend to wear? Red or green, blue, white, or brown? Has he shown you his togs?â Mene. Take care! Ajax [crossing the stage brusquely R. to L.]. Get out of my path, or I'll knock you down! [Thunder and lightning. Stops confronting it. Jupiter Tonans, me it's no use frightening; I spurn your thunder, and defy your lightning. A pugilistic gentleman in training If thus you'd damp, it's time you left off reigning. Eating raw steaks, with sherry's imbibition, I've got myself into such fierce condition, That I'm afraidâall other fears deridingâ 'Tis fated I shall never get that hiding. I should like one; but I must be retreatingâ I've half a mile to go before the meeting. [Exit L. Enter Agamemmon [R.], with bottle and glass, and Teucer with a horse-cloth. Aga. Cover him up, lest he should take a chill. [Exit Teucer after Ajax, L. Mene. Your hurry, brother? Aga. Oh! I can't stand still. I'm training him: the fight large stakes I've got on. Between ourselves, I've rather put the pot on. [Exit L. Patro. But to my question. Tell me, have you seen Achilles' rig? Mene. I haven't. Patro. Can you glean Any particulars of what it's made of? I durstn't ask, his rage I'm so afraid of; He snubs me so, in spite of all my homage: Is stripes thought nobby, or is checks the fromage. Mene. That I can't say: I'm sure, though, I'm not wrong In saying waists is short and skirts is long. Patro. I'll get mine alter'd. What's the size of button? Mene. Cheese-plates. Patro. No bigger? Sleeves isâ Mene. Legs of mutton. Patro. I'll to my tailors. Time, perhaps, there still is To make me look exactly like Achilles. [Exit. Enter in procession Agamemnon, Ulysses, Achilles, Teucer, Talthybius, Nestor, &amp;c. Achilles has a new suit of armour on, and is very splendid. He and Agamemnon scowl at each other. Aga. Ulysses, in the sporting man's capacity, You've scarcely shown your usual sagacity. Our man must winâhe's in condition prime; Take my advice, and edge while you have time. Ulys. Let matters bide. [Aside.] I think the danger's well met. Achilles. Ithacus, how d'ye like the new pith helmet? It's Trojanâus they throw in darkness Stygian In dress: of course you know the âpegtop'sâ Phrygian? A brilliant notion! [Spreads pockets. Ulys. Weel, as trews, nae doot: They're trifling things we dinna care aboot. Aga. Is not yon Diomed, with Calchas' daughter? Ulys. 'Tis he. I ken his gait. Aga. I'm glad he's brought her. [All look off L. Music: âSee the Conqu'ring Hero.â Enter Cupid, strutting. They do not see him. Cupid [aside to audience]. Invisible this time! [Stabs the Greeks one after another, all but Achilles, who turns up the stage. One! two! three! four! Ulys. [shaking his head]. I see you, mon. Cupid. You Calydonian bore! There's no concealing anything from you: Those northern lights pierce any darkness through. I've a good mind toâ [Offering to shoot him. Ulys. Hoot! you'd burn your prime. Enter Patroclus [R.], in a miraculous costume, not in the least resembling Achilles. Patro. I hope I'm not too late. Cupid. Noâjust in time. [He stabs Patroclus just as Cressida enters at the opposite side, led in by Diomed. Exit Cupid R. Patro. [looking at Cressida]. Gemini cry! What lovely vision's that? [Looking at Achilles, appears overwhelmed with that warrior's costume. O horror! [Faints. Menelaus catches him. Mene. What? Patro. Them pegsâthat 'ev'nly hat. I thought this style the mark was something near. Just like my luck! Aga. Welcome, my pretty dear! [Kisses Cressida. Nestor. Our guests we always welcome with a kiss; So in my turnâ [Kisses her. Cres. [aside]. A curious custom this! But folks in Rome must do as Romans do. Achilles. Nestor, I'll take the lady after you. Cres. [aside]. What a superb young man! [Achilles kisses her. Patro. The favour greatâ Mene. Age before honesty, Patroclus. Wait! [Thrusts him aside and kisses her. Cres. Pray are there any more? Teucer. A little one. [Patroclus tries to get before him. Don't push, sir! Patro. [crestfallen]. Beg your pardon, when you've done. [Teucer kisses Cressida. Cres. [aside]. In Troy this conduct would be thought effront'ry. But then, of course, the customs of a country Must be obey'd. Patro. My claim may I enforce? [A trumpet. Talthybius [thrusts Patroclus aside]. The signal for the combat! Clear the course! Cres. Let me not see the terrible event. Dio. Lady, I'll lead you to your father's tent. [Exeunt Diomed and Cressida, R. Patroclus, thrust aside by everybody, is defrauded of his kiss. Trumpet repeated. Enter Ajax, armed. Ajax. Well, gentlemen, I'm hereâas large as life, And twice as naturalâarm'd for the strife, Anxious to see if Trojan Hector vaunted Can let me have that licking I've long wanted; Or, if he can't afford the whole amount, To know how much he can stand on account. [Trumpet. Tal. Great Hector's trumpet. Aga. Well, it sounds high metall'd. Enter Ãneas, attended. Ãneas. Hail, all you state of Greece! How is it settled? Aga. How is what settled, Trojan? Ãneas. Why the fight. Is Ajax pick'd to dare great Hector's might? Aga. Why do you ask? Ãneas. Chiefly to be enlighten'd. Hector would rather not. Ajax [aside]. Of course, he's frighten'd. Aga. His motive? Ãneas. Oracles declare the war Will never end till Peleus' son once more, Our chief to fight, in shining armour sheath him. Hector, besides, thinks Ajax is beneath him. [Achilles shrugs his shoulders contemptuously. Ajax. Your name? Ãneas. Ãneas. Ajax. Good! This insolence I look on as an Ãneas offence; And so, before illustrious Hector comes, I'll polish you off. [Squaring at him. Aga. [wildly]. Strike the kettle drums; Sound trumpets, gongs; let off squibs, rockets, crackers, To silence him! [To Ajax]. Have mercy on your backers! Enter Hector, armed, attended by Troilus (wearing Cressida's glove in his helmet) and Suite. Diomed re-enters, and places himself as Ajax's second. Ãneas performs the same office for Hector. Hector and Ajax shake hands. Hector [showing his sword to Ajax]. How would you like itâpointedly or smiting? Ajax. At any rate, suppose we take it fighting. Hector [to Talthybius]. I hope you're well supplied with lint and plasters? Tal. Lots. Hector. Give the word. Tal. Now, swells, shy up your castors! [Shout. Hector and Ajax fight. Dio. [to Ajax]. Rest, warrior, rest! Ajax. I'm not fatigued. Dio. Then drink. [Gives him a drink. Ajax utters a yell of pain, and falls helpless in Diomed's arms. Ajax. I'm poison'd! Dio. What! Ajax [faintly]. âSouth African,â I think. Ulys. [aside, exulting]. I fill'd the flask mysel'. Aga. O fatal blunder! That draught may lose the fight. Teucer. I shouldn't wonder. Hector. Ajax, some other time I'll make you bleed. Ajax. I'm not to have that licking, it's decreed. Aga. Cover him well, that he from cold may 'scape. Ajax [faintly, rejecting cloak]. No, I can't stand a doubling of the Cape. CONCERTED PIECE.âA Guinea and a One Pound Note. Aga. Take him up! take him up! He's been hocuss'd, it is plain, By a sup from a cup: It's a case of âRunning Rein.â Ulys. [aside]. Which I'm far from contradicting since that famous case he quotes, For a mon must save his guineas and his one-pound notes. [Ajax is carried out helpless. Perhaps our guest will do us now the pleasure Of dancing us a lively Phrygian measure, Or singing something? Hector. Oh, you're very kind; But in the arts of peace I'm all behind. There's nothing in the graceful line I know, Unless you'd like to see a Rarey show. Aga. Oh! what is that? Hector. A trifling gift of mine: I've some renown in the horse-taming line. If you can find a nag of vicious stampâ Aga. Bring in the very worst horse in the camp. Tal. Our worst, my liege, met with his undertaker This morning in a wealthy sausage-maker. Hector. Then he's past cure. Aga. So bring the next worst prad on. [Talthybius makes a sign. Music: âGee ho, Dobbin!â A Groom comes in, leading a kicking horse. Will he do? Hector. I've my doubts. He looks a bad one. [Ãneas brings Hector a sixpenny drum and penny trumpet. Business, Hector taming the horse with the drum. The horse becomes fascinated, and changes his kicking into a pas de deux with Hector. Agamemnon takes a whip and officiates Ã  la Widdicomb. Hector and the horse dance. The characters look on with interest. The animal kneels humbly down. Hector puts his foot on him in the attitude of Mr. Rarey. Aga. A miracle! The wild horse made a tame one! Dio. Who could believe the beast to be the same one? Aga. O wondrous man! impart your secret's treasure. Hector. At ten pun'ten per head all roundâwith pleasure! Ulys. Sir, ye're an extraordinary mon. Hector. Your flattery's charmingâ Ulys. Nay, I'm using none. It's wonderfu'! Now, I've a tit mysel' That I can neither manage, break, nor sell. Hector. A kicker? Ulys. Not precisely. Hector. Hard-mouth'd, p'rhaps? Ulys. Well, rather. [Aside.] Made of planks, bolts, nails, and straps. Hector. Shies? Ulys. Naeâhe's pretty steady, eye and limb. But now you mention it, folks shy at him. Hector. Why so? Ulys. He's rather large and obstinate: For months he wouldn't pass his stable gate. We knock'd the wall downâshoved him neck and crapâ The stubborn creature stuck fast in the gap, And wadna budge, all we could do or say, More than a quarter of an inch a day; And when weel launch'd and sailing smooth we 'count him, Why, scarce a living soul will dare to mount him. Hector. Pray might one see this wondrous tit for tat? Ulys. See him! Why, yes; he big eno' for that. Just bring him round. Music: âThe Bronze Horse.â Minerva rises [L.] close to Hector, and holds the Ã¦gis before his eyes. Cupid enters L., and tries to prevent her. Min. Love, interrupt not me! Hector I've sworn to-day shall blinded be To Wisdom's ways, and be, in fact, an ass. The Ã¦gis has perform'd its charm. [Withdraws it, disappears. Cupid. Alas! [Exit. Music continued. The Giant Horse is brought in R. to L. Hector. A splendid creature, if without a vice Save those you mention'd. May I ask his price? Ulys. You'd really like him? Hector. As a curiosity. Ulys. Accept him as a gift. [Shaking his hand. Hector. This generosity, Sublime Ulysses, knocks me in a heap. Ulys. Prince, the fact is, I can't afford his keep. Hector. What does he eat? Ulys. His appetites are funny. As yet he's swallow'd nothing except money; But get him once to work, whate'er folks say, I'll back Leviathan to pay his way. Hector. Doubts of his paying strike me not with aweâ I'll do my best to make him run and draw. Ulys. When shall I send him home? Hector. Whene'er you please. Ulys. Of course there'll be some trifling turnpike fees To pass him into Troyâthey'll scarce be large. Hector. Do you suppose I'd put you to the charge? [Writes in pocket-book and tears leaf out. âTroy turnpike trustâone horseâclears ScÃ¦an wicket:â That, my too generous friend, you'll find the ticket. [Exeunt.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VI. âStreet of huts in the Grecian Camp. The hut or pavilion of Calchas [L.]. That of Achilles supposed to be off R. Enter Cressida [L.], followed by Cupid, the latter carrying three handsome bouquets. Cres. So you, who pass'd yourself off as my cousin, Are Cupid? Cupid. Oh! disguises by the dozen I in as many seconds can assume. Just now the shape of Agamemnon's groom I donn'd, which made him bid me step this way, With the king's compliments and this bouquet. [Presents it. Cres. His majesty! How very flattering! [Reads a motto on the bouquet. âSweets to the sweet!â Is not that like a king? So terse, so pointedâabove all, so new! Cupid [gives another]. This one is from Atrides number two. Cres. His brother! Ah! the flow'rs are scarce as fine; And oh! how much less tasteful in design Than the dear king's! Cupid [aside]. No man of fame I'd rob; But Agamemnon bought his for a bob, Ready made up; while t'other, like a ninny, Composed his own of flow'rs that cost a guinea. One more. [Gives third bouquet. Cres. [pleased]. From whom is this? Cupid. The Pylian sage. Cres. The dear old man! Gallant at such an age! 'Bove all I prize the off'ring of wise Nestor! Cupid [aside]. Who wisely purchased it for just one tester. [Cressida can get rid of bouquets by putting them in at the window of her father's pavilion. Cres. Has any other Grecian been so bold? For instance, that young man in white and gold, With spreading, spangled what's-o'-names. Cupid [shaking his head]. Pelides! E'en to my darts invulnerable his hide is. Cres. [trying to conceal her pique]. I'm glad some of them good behaviour know. Cupid. I haven't done with my commissions, though. A letter. [Gives one. Cres. Ha! Cupid. From TroilusâI've just met him. Cres. [covering her face with shame passionately]. You naughty Cressid! how could you forget him For e'en a second, with his matchless worth? Cupid. A second! Please to add a third and fourth, A fifth, a sixth, a seventh, eighth, and so on. Cres. Well, sir, whose fault is it if I do go on Somewhat flirtatiously? You've fill'd my heart With so much love, 'tis like a water-cart Under a pumpâ(I fear not your displeasure)â Whose pipes would burst from sheer hydraulic pressure, Were they not pierced, with grateful overflow To drench the little dirty boys below. Troilus is as the basin of the fountain, In which my love is pour'd, the sides surmounting. If some drops overflow, am I to blame That Diomed holds his mouth to catch the same; That great Atrides hovers round the brink, And e'en old Nestor comes to beg a drink? [Aside]. Achilles don't seem thirsty. Cupid. You're a flirt! Cres. Who made me one? Cupid [aside]. Well, I did. [Aloud.] Then no hurt Shall come of it. Pursue the path you're wending: Love can bring all things to a pleasant ending. SONG.âCupid. Air âIt is sweet to think, as through life, &amp;c. [Both off. Darkness has increased. Voices heard in Achilles' tent singing, âFor he's a jolly good fellow,â &amp;c. Jingling of glasses. Enter Patroclus [R.], disguised in the invincible suit of Achilles worn by that chieftain in the lists. The helmet, shield, breastplate, &amp;c., are all much too big for him. Patro. They're keeping of it up. I sha'n't be miss'd: Somehow I never am. Great Hector's twist At eating than at fighting seems no humbler. I find, too, he appreciates his tumbler. [Jingling of glasses within. Nor does the youthful Troilus deem it sinful To put away a tolerable skinful. Ajax the slow goes rather fast to-night, And the loose Diomed is getting tight. Swarth Agamemnon's drunk as Nestor snowy, And Menelaus he's as drunk as Chloe. Achilles, 'twixt his twelfth and thirteenth grogs, I humbugg'd into lending me his togs. In this invulnerable suit e'en I Must be invincible; at least, I'll try. [Cressida appears at window, embroidering. They fit me splendidly in every limb. Cres. [musing]. Achilles! Patro. There, you see, she thinks I'm him. [Tenderly.]Cressâida! Cres. Ha! that shield, that helmet white! 'Tis he himself; but how reduced in height! Illustrious Achillesâ Patro. [aside]. Well, it's cheek! But still here goes. Ma'am? Cres. If to you I speak, As p'rhaps I ought not here alone so late, 'Tis for a question of importance great. What have you done to make yourself so little? Patro. P'rhaps it's the frosty weather makes one brittle, And bits chip off; or here's where the shoe pinchesâ Love, lady, love is killing me by inches, And half a foot of me is dead already. [Aside.] That wasn't bad. Cres. Indeed! Pray who's the lady? Enter Ulysses with a torch [R.], and Troilus. Ulys. Stand where the torch may not discover us. Patro. Her name is Cressida. Cres. Preposterous! [Drops a flower. Patroclus picks it up and kisses it. Troi. She's thrown him out a flower. 'Twas done on purpose. I'll strangle himâ Ulys. [restrains]. That Act of Habeas Corpus Suspend: you know I have your word. Troi. Enough! Patro. I loved you, lady, at first sight. Cres. What stuff! You Grecian gentlemen are so gallant. [Drops another flower. Troi. Another flowerâ Ulys. Be patient, mon. Troi. I can't. Ulys. Your promise! Cres. Is that all you had to say? Patro. That! O dear no, Missânot by a long way. [Aside]. I'd got a splendid stock of love expressions, Some of them old, but a good many fresh 'uns, Chiefly from songs. [Tries to remember. Flower dropped. Troi. Rage! Ulys. Hoot, he's not worth ony! Patro. [with sudden passion]. Ever of thee! Maxweltown's braes are bonnie. Beautiful Venice! bride of ocean flowing, I had a flow'r within my garden growing, And of the fact you may not be aware, I nourish'd it with fond and anxious careâ [Aside].I'm getting on like steamâwhich makes me ask, In case of hollow hearts behind a mask, Smiling as they were wont to smile before, That you'll remember me. Stop! there's some more. [Aside]. Queen of my soulâI've lost the cue, I vowâ I have itâWill you love me then as now? Cres. [aside]. Poor fellow! he seems dreadfully heart-broken. Footsteps! I must retire. Patro. Leave me some token Less perishable than these beauteous flow'rs, That I may hopeâ Troi. He takes her hand. Great powers! He kisses it! She lets him! [Ulysses resisting him. Cres. Pray let goâ It's most improper. I insistâ Patro. First throw Some trifling keepsake 'gainst my heart to press, [Aside]. And brag about to-morrow at the mess. Cres. Somebody's coming. What will people say? Bother the man! take that, and get away. [Throws Troilus's sleeve to him, and slams window in his face. Patroclus sticks it in his helmet with exultation. Patro. Of victory I'll sport this as a trophy. Troi. [aside]. And in the fight, my friend, I'll knock it off ye; And see, the head comes with it. As I live, [Looks at the cuff. The cuff that I was fool enough to give To her that tea-time! What a jilt to use so! And what a muff-at-tea I was to do so. [Troilus and Ulysses back R. Patro. They're breaking up, I see, and come this way: Their weak nerves to astonish I'll essay. Enter [R.] Hector, rather âhow came you so?â in a gentlemanly way. Achilles, in a dressing-gown, Greek border, and smoking cap, also considerably sprung. Agamemnon, Menelaus, and Nestor, all particularly lively. Hector [shaking hands affectionately with Achilles, and (?) lighting a cigar]. Good night, old f'lah! Achilles. Care o' yourself, old boy. Hector. Now, recollect, my days at home in Troy While the truce lastsâFrundays and Sidaysâno; Sundays, that's itâand twice a week. Mene. [affectionately]. Don't go. Hector. Mustâbusinessâgrave appointmentsâletters t'write. Achilles, sha'n't we meet in the next fight? Achilles. Coolness between myself and royal party Makes it impossible. Good night, my hearty. [Shakes hands, and exit R. Nestor. Let's make a night of it. Hector. What bricks you are! P'rhaps a late oyster and a cool cigarâ Troi. [L. of Hector, taking his arm]. Come home. [Aside.] Duty o'er selfish int'rest wins. Hector. My little brother Troilus! [Turns to look at him. Why, you're twins! Troi. 'Tis you see two of me. [Ulysses off, back. Hector [crosses gravely to Patroclus, and shakes hands with him]. Good night, Achilles. Patro. [aside, delighted]. This of all compliments the greatest still isâ He takes me for him. Hector. Why, you've changed your dress. Troi. You are mistaken. Hector. No. Troi. But I say yes. Hector. Achilles is in bed by this time. Troi. What! Think you that shield and helmet I've forgot? I saw them in the lists to-day, and thought How I should like them the next time we fought. Suppose we square it now. [Pugilistic attitude. Patro. [alarmed]. Jove and Jove's mother! [Humbly]. I'm not Achilles. Hector. Then, sir, you're another. I want those armsâthey'd fit me to a T. Those pegtops, too, are just the thing for me. Patro. [aside]. What will Achilles say? His fav'rite suit! Hector [aside]. I want a row! Here, what's that thing, you brute? [Snatches sleeve from helmet of Patroclus. Patro. Only a gage d'amour. Return it, please. Hector [foggily]. I dimly recollectâthese muffettees Troilus I gave for night-work in the trench; And this, I call to mind, he gave that wench. What right with Cressid's presents, pray, have you? Patro. She gave itâ Hector. Then I'll give it to you too. [Knocks him down with a single blow. Patro. Murder! Mene. and Nestor. Police! [They run off R. Troi. [trying with Ãneas to move Hector]. Quick, let us home, my brother. Hector [the sleeve in his hand]. No hurry! One good cuff deserves another. [He floors Patroclus again on that personage's attempting to rise, and deliberately proceeds to strip him of his arms. Rattles heard outside; drums, &amp;c. SCENA.âTroilus, Hector, and Ãneas. AirâThe Steam Arm. Troi. I see approach the watchman's lamp: You've waken'd up the sleeping camp. Hector. I don't intend an inch to tramp, Till with my steam arm I've pummell'd the scamp. [Pummels the prostrate Patroclusâin Chanceryâto chorus. With a tooral ooral, &amp;c. [Hector clothes himself in the breastplate, helmet, shield, &amp;c., leaving Patroclus a ridiculous object in the pegtops and red flannel jacket. Troi. To think mere wine from Grecian farms O'er Hector's mind could throw such charms. Hector [rising equipped]. I don't care twopence for all alarms, I've whopp'd Achilles, and stripp'd his arms. Ri tooral ooral, &amp;c. [They lead him off L., exulting to chorus. Patroclus remains on the stage immovable, âspread-eagle-wise.â Morceau de ChÅur, Descriptive of the fight for the body of Patroclus. Airâfrom âNorma.â [Some Greek Soldiers, with policemen's capes, hats, and truncheons, run in L., and attempt to take Patroclus into custody. At the same time enter Agamemnon, Nestor, Menelaus, Diomed, Teucer, and Talthybius, in different states of nocturnal dishabille. They almost tear Patroclus (whose nose is discovered bleeding) in half between them. Chorus. Greeks. Guerra! Guerra! Here's a fearful error! This is not the individual actually in fault. Police. Where are, where are, Then, the folks to bear a Charge of aggravated and most violent assault? Enter Ajax, fiercely [R.]. Ajax. Wonder! blunder! Turf, and also thunder! Why was I not sent for when the mischief was begun? Police. Nail him! Greeks. Bail him! Off to lock-ups hale himâ Patro. Might an 'umble individual ask what he has done? [Ulysses slips in during this at back. Chorus and strife resumed. Guerra, &amp;c. [They continue pulling Patroclus from right to left between them. Music stops suddenly. Enter Achilles [R.], violently excited. Achilles. Speak! is it true? Patro. [showing himself deplorably]. Here's evidence of worth! Achilles. Oh, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth! My faithful toady! imitating me, Got you your head punch'd? Patro. Slightly, as you see. I fared myself but badly, I confess, at it. That isn't half the worst, though. Achilles. Humph! I guess at it. Patro. Your armour has been stolen, and your âpegsâ Damaged considerably about the legs. Achilles. Merciful heaven! [Ã  la Macduff. Ulys. What! Upon your brow, sirs, Ne'er pull your hat like that. Achilles. He has no trousers! What! all my toilette, framed on such a plan, At one fell swoop! Ulys. Dispute it like a man. Achilles. I shall do so, but feel it must likewiseâ Oh! I could play the woman with my eyes, And braggart with my tongueâsave such a pair! [Weeps. I cannot but remember such things were. But mighty Jove, cut short all intermission! Swift, front to front, in active opposition, Bring me instanter with this fiend of Ilion! Aga. I'll back you, if you'll fight, for half a million. Achilles. Fight! I'll do nothing else while I have breath. [Thetis rises close to him, with a new suit of armour, shield, &amp;c. Thetis. Then put these things on, or you'll get your death. Achilles. Mamma, I really wish you wouldn't bother. Thetis. That's how he always treats his anxious mother! Achilles. Dissolve the truce at onceâthe town I'll storm! Thetis [offering breastplate]. But put this on: you ought to wrap up warm. Achilles [going L.]. At once I'll see my myrmidons enroll'd. [Exit L. Thetis [following]. Achilles, take the shield, or you'll take cold. [Exit after him. [The Greeks assume warlike attitudes. Ajax off. Ulysses beckons them round him, and sings. AirâJohnny Cope. Hech! I've a plan that's the best, I'll bet. I haven't sent the horse to Ilion yet; Into his ribs I trow we'll get, And they'll let us into Troy in the morning. Let Hector's drum go brrrrrr!!!! Ulysses' pipes go we-e-e-e-e. Wha'll pay the piper we'll determine yet, When they let us into Troy in the morning. ChorusââBronze Horse.â Let's be going, time is flowingâ And a stitch in it's well worth nineâ While Achilles in the will is, Private grudge to the Greeks to resign. Mount the horse, the idea's not bad; Give him his head, and his hoof we'll pad; Ilion's city shall open its eyes, Rather amazed at our night surprise. [Music stops suddenly, as they are moving off L. Enter Homer [R.]. Homer. Stop! Is it settled we're to mount the horse? Aga. It is. Homer. Then my suggestion comes, of course. [Sings. Wait for the waggon, Wait for the waggon, Wait for the waggon, and we'll all have a ride. [Chorus, to take them off.</field>

By right, I ought to go and tell my mother; But then to miss the sport! All foods above, Mischief is the real nourishment of love; And Love may yet save Ilionâthere's no telling. The puppy Paris fights for his rib Helen, As even curs will fight for bones of their bones; While Troilus, worn, through Cressid false, to bare bones, Preserves an arm of muscle, and still strikes it. Hector, of course, fights on because he likes it. Enter Patroclus [R.], Troilus following. Troi. Fly not! If thou the river Styx should take, I would swim after thee. Patro. I'm wide awake: The game of sticks two play at. I prefer The single-handed stumps, which I shall stir [Runs out L., Troilus after him. Cupid [clapping his hands]. Now, Grecian! At him, Trojan! Hang the cost! The game is all for Love and Troy well lost. [Exit after them, L. Enter Hector [R.], in the helmet, breastplate, &amp;c., of Achilles. Hector. They have tied me to a stakeâI cannot flee; But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he Invulnerable except about the heel? From such alone have I alarm to feel. Enter Teucer [L.]. Teucer. What is thy name? Hector. When thou dost learn thou'lt fear it. Teucer. That is as may be: I should like to hear it. Hector. Hector! Teucer. The prey of which I am in chase. Hector. You poor dear child! the heel's not your soft place. [Aims a blow at his head, which Ajax, entering L., wards off with his shield. Makes a rapid sign for Teucer to be off. Teucer obeys, and exit L. Ajax. You'd strike my little brotherâ Hector. Great or small. [They fight. Ajax. P'rhaps I'm to have that licking, after all. [Hector and Ajax fight off L. Homer [who has entered following them, writes]. A splendid incident, I'd not have miss'd For half the world, to finish up my list. âHectorââhum!ââTeucer, Ajaxââgood!ââleft fighting.â [Alarums. âDreadful impossibility of writing; But still your correspondent's reputation For judgment, aided by imaginationââ [Looks off R. âThe fierce Achilles, arm'd with sword and javelinâ E'en as I write!ââ [A dreadful explosion, L. Murder!ââPop goes the ravelin.â [Exit, alarmed, in a hurry, L. Enter Achilles [R.]. Achilles. That way the noise is. Robber, show thy mug! If any other sword than mine be dug Within thy ribs deeply enough to kill, My pegtop trousers' ghosts will haunt me still. I see him, then! Who knock'd Patroclus flat? Who stole the donkey? Him in the pith hat. [Exit L., furiously. Alarums, shouts. Enter Ulysses, Diomed, Menelaus, Nestor, and Talthybius, with Soldiers [R.]. Ulys. This way, my friends the town is gently render'dâ Priam and sons have their submission tender'd, Save Hector and young Troilus, still high-mettled: Them Ajax and Achilles must have settled. Dio. Who saw the king? Ulys. Hech, I didâin the 'fray, Striving 'gainst fearful oddsâto run away. But let's be first to Ãneas' abode, Where, I'm inform'd, there's lots of siller stow'd. SONG.âUlysses. AirâBonny Dundee. By the laws of convention, 'tis prettily thought That for justice, and honour, and truth we have fought; But the gowd and the gems, the siller of Troy's, Has a Troy weight that beats all such avoirdupois. Then fill up your pouches, and fill up your bags; Pile up all your chariots, and load all your nags; Though Fame's an inducement to fecht and to dee, Yet it is'na sae strong as the bonny bawbee. [Exeunt L. 2nd. Alarums, drums, &amp;c. Enter Hector, L. (first), Ã  la Macbeth. Rushes across to R., going to fall on his sword. Hector. Why should I play the Roman fool and die? As Rome's not built yetâecho answers, why? I'll stop and fight it out. Enter Achilles [L.]. Achilles. Turn hell-hound! Hector. Bother You and your turns! Still one deserves another. Yet no; I'll spare your headâyou take a pride of it, And I've got all 'tis worthâ Achilles. What? Hector [touching helmet]. The outside of it. Achilles. I have no wordsâmy voice is in my sword. [Strikes at him. Hector wards the blow calmly. Hector. It hasn't said much yet. [Achilles strikes again. Business repeated. Don't hear a word; You're losing labour. P'rhaps you're not aware I bear a charmed life, and need not care, But for a man whom weapons cannot harm, Save in the heel alone. Achilles. Despair thy charm, And let the oracle who taught that truth Tell thee, Achilles, in his earliest youth, One nightâ'twas Saturdayâfor washing stripp'd (The tub not ready), in the Styx was dipp'd Hector. Accursed be the tongue that tells me so! There you're invulnerable: of course I know The river's charm. But how about the heel? Achilles. My mother, finding me inclined to squeal, Held me by that as me the stream she put in it. Hector. This time, at least, I hope you've put your foot in it. Who cares for oracles? Lay on, you muff, And d? Achilles. Don't be coarse. Hector. Who first cries, âHold, enough.â [They fight. Enter Agamemnon [L.], puffing and blowing Ã  la Falstaff. Aga. Well said, Achilles! At him on the head! Enter Troilus [L.]. Troi. Patroclus has escaped; you'll do instead. [He attacks Agamemnon, who falls down as if dead, and exit R. Hector falls wounded. Hector. Achilles, thou hast knock'd me off life's hook. The loss of brittle life I better brook Than those proud titles thou hast won of me: They'll make you, I've no doubt, a K. C. B. Oh! I could prophesy but for this dizziness. Besides, I wasn't brought up to the business. My sister was Cassandra, who, I trustâ No more at present. Hector, thou art dust, And food forâ [Falls senseless. Achilles. Wormsâgreat Hector would have said, But ere he spoke the word his spirit fled. At least I hope so; p'rhaps 'twas but a stun. The heart beats not. I'll for my chariot run, And drag him, tied behind it, round the city. 'Twill be effective, though perhaps not pretty. [Exit R. Agamemnon rises slowly. Aga. It strikes me forciblyâI'm not quite clearâ I'm plagiarising somebody's idea, In saying (p'rhaps 'tis merely a conjectur') I am afraid of this gunpowder Hector. Though he be dead, 'twould be a pleasant treat Should he, as well as I, prove counterfeit; Therefore I thinkâyou couldn't blame me, could you?â I'll just make sure, and say I kill'd him. [Going to stab Hector. Hector [looking up]. Would you? [Agamemnon runs off bellowing R., Hector after him. N.B.âHector, on rising, to give the idea of a man who has really just recovered his senses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE THE LAST. In Troy, near the Palace of Ãneas [R.], and the Temple of Vesta [L.]. Red lights at wing. Enter Helen, crouching and terrified [R.]. Helen. Alas! where shall I fly? Report declares Great Hector has been slain. The city glares One blaze of triumph, lit with real Greek fire, Which, from the frying-pan of Trojan ire, I'm likely to fall into! Noble Hector! Dear friend and champion! Helen's sole protector! From whom it ne'er has been my fate to find A deed ungentle, or a thought unkind. When others cursed the auth'ress of their woe, Thy pity check'd my sorrows in their flow. The fate that I have caused how must I moan! Sad Helen has no friend if thou art gone! I am pursued! Where shall I flyâay, where? Ha! Vesta's Templeâthough I've small right there. [Runs into temple, L. Enter [R.] Priam, Antenor, Hecuba, Andromache, Trojan Women, &amp;c.; Paris being carefully muffled up and codled by the women; Troilus, with his sword drawn, escorting them. Troi. In for your livesâyon temple's sacred screen Will shelter you. Andro. Where last was Hector seen? Troi. Where I must join himâin the thickest fight, A Troilus. Ho! [Exit R. Priam [to Paris]. Puppy, does not the sight Of such a child in arms your blood provoke? Paris. Think of one's hands, papa, in such a smoke. Impossible! On to the sacred dwelling! Hecuba. If I could only catch that hussy, Helen! Priam. Into the temple quickâthe heat increases. [Exeunt L. Enter Homer, wildly excited [R.]. Homer. Ilion has fallen. Let's pick up the pieces! [Exit L. Patroclus runs across the stage after him, R. to L. Enter Ãneas [R.], with his aged father on his back, his little son by the hand. Servants following with household gods, &amp;c. Ãneas. Come, governor, our house we'd better quitâ There's a distress inâby a moonlight flit. Though all the gods side with the Grecian banner, At least one Trojan dares to shoot Diana. [Helen is heard to scream from the temple. She rushes out, pursued vindictively by Hecuba and other Trojans, the whole party of fugitives following. Other Trojans enter R. Hecuba. The shameless wretch, to dare to show her face With decent people, and in such a place! A Trojan. Down with the hated cause of all our strife! Helen [crouching]. Have pity on my face, if not my life! Hecuba. To tear her eyes out is at least my duty. Mob. Stone her to deathâ [They are about to rush on Helen. Cupid, armed with a dart and buckler, springs through the scene and protects her. Cupid. Who dares to spoil my beauty? Love only was the cause of her delusion, And love has brought its fruits to a conclusion. The siege of Troy is ended. Hecuba. But Troy's chief, Our gallant son? Andro. [aside]. I tremble like a leaf. Enter Homer [L.], Patroclus following. Homer. I grieve to say the melancholy task Devolves on me to answer what you ask. Great Hector is no moreâ [Andromache faints, and is borne out by her maids. The others show deep signs of grief. Priam. 'Tis true, then? Homer. Yes; The fact's already telegraph'd to press. Priam. Oh! then it must beâ Patro. [aside to Homer]. I say, you're mistaken. Homer. Don't interrupt. Priam. To hear the worst unshaken, I'll like a Trojan strive. Homer [moved]. My facts, you see, Are from the best authority. Patro. [aside]. That's me! Homer. Achilles Hector slew. Patro. [aside]. Who said so? Homer. Wait! The same authority proceeds to state The ruthless victor, having stripp'd the bodyâ Patro. Shocking! I didn'tâ Homer. Silence, you tom-noddy! Encased his martial limbs in tops and smalls, And dragg'd him three times round the city walls, Tied to his dogcart's tail. Patro. Here! Homer, Silence, monkey! Priam. His noble corse trick'd out like a stuff'd flunkey. The villain's motive? Homer. To insult the dead. Patro. [unable to restrain himself any longer]. I'm blest if he's spoke a word of what I said. Homer. Villain! 'tis what you swore to me as fact, And which already off to press I've pack'd Verbatim, to instruct each age and nation, With some slight ornament and emendation. Patro. I only saidâ Priam. Speak. Patro. I saw great Thetis' son, Driving his four-in-hand, like lightning run, And Hector after him. Homer. In tops and smalls, Lifeless. Patro. [loud]. No! All I said was, round the walls Hector was like a tiger after him. I meant as fierce as oneâ Homer [overwhelmed]. Oh, this is trim! Of history I've caused some nice confusions. Moral: ye writers, jump not at conclusions. I thought he meant liveried like a slave Hector he saw, and this side of the grave Hector to that I knew would not submit; Therefore I thought him dead, and posted it. Cupid. You, in your next epistle, can explain it. Homer. Hanged if I doâlitera scripta manet. Cupid. Take heart, thou too imaginative youth; E'en at the worst you're always near the truth. Hecuba. Oh, say not so! Cupid. Be patient, queen, I wish you; See, hither comes the melancholy issue Of the dread strife 'twixt Thetis' son and thine. Helen. Oh! I must hide my eyes. Hecuba. As I must mine. [Dead March. Enter the Greek chieftains in melancholy procession, two and twoâAgamemnon, Ulysses, Menelaus, Diomed, Talthybius, Teucer. After them Achilles, in a Bath chair, wrapped in blankets or cloak, and looking very miserable. Thetis in agony, attending upon him. Hector, perfectly safe and sound, guiding the chair, and attending his late adversary with much solicitude. Homer [aside]. That's near enough to my description, quite. Hector. How do you feel, old fellow, now? Achilles [his teeth chattering]. All right. Thetis. The stars be thank'd! Pray get him something warm. Priam. The meaning of this incident informâ Hector. A good half-hour we in fierce strife debated, Then in the field got somehow separated. Achilles, to work off his surplus dander, Must needs engage with Xanthus and Scamander, The river gods, and, where their two streams meet, Plungedâ Thetis. He so delicate about the feet! Aga. When gallant Hector dived his foe to saveâ Hector. For which a testimonial you gave, In shape of easy terms of peace and ransom. Priam. Humane society! How very handsome! Cupid. Jump up, Achilles. Let's an end make quick to it. Homer [aside]. I like my version best, and mean to stick to it. Hector. With all our sorry hits and clumsy cuts, And straggling arrows aim'd at noble butts, I trust there's no one wounded seriously. Enter Ajax [L.], his arm in a sling, his face bound up and plastered. Ajax. Your pardonâan exception make of me. Hector. Not mortally? Ajax. No, I'm alive and kicking. I merely call'd to state I got that licking. Hector. And didn't like it? Ajax. Tell that to your mother. Didn't I? I'm impatient for another. Hector. I trust to give you one per night for weeks, [To audience]. If, as staunch Trojans and as merry Greeks, Our struggles are approved; for, after all, It rests with you if Troy must stand or fall. [Troilus and Cressida come in reconciled. Cupid joins their hands. FINALE.</field>
