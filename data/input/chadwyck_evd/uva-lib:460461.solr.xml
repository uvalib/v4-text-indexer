      <field name="fulltext">THE PRINCESS OF PARMA</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the following winter of 1774 the theatricals were renewed at Kelmarsh. The following Prologue was written on the occasion by Mr. Cumberland: âEre dark November, with his dripping wings, Shuts out the cheerful face of men and things, You all can tell how soon the dreary scene Infects your wives and daughters with the spleen. Madam begins:ââmy dear, these odious rains, Will bring on all my old rheumatic pains: In fifty places it came in last night, This vile old crazy mansion's such a fright. What's to be done? in very truth, my love, I think 't were better for us to remove.â This said, if so it chance that gentle spouse Bears but a second interest in the house, The Bill is past; no sooner said than done; Up springs the hen-bird, and the covey's gone. Then hey for London; then the game begins; Bouquets, and diamond stars, and golden pins; A thousand freakish wants, a thousand sighs, A thousand poutings, and ten thousand lies. Trimm'd and new rigg'd, and launch'd for pleasure's gale, Out Madam comes, her goslings at her tail; Away they scamper to present their faces At Johnston's citadel, for side-box places; He to their joint and supplicating moan, Presents a face of brass and heart of stone; Or, monarch like, while their address is stating, Sends them a veto by his Lord in waiting. Returning thence the disappointed fleet Anchors in Tavistock's fantastic street; Then under Folly's colours gaily rides, Where Humour points, or veering Fashion guides. In vain the steward racks, the tenants rave, Money she wants, and money she will have. Meanwhile terrific hangs the unpaid bill, Long as from Portman-square to Ludgate-hill. The Squire exhausted, in desponding plight, Creeps to his chambers to avoid the sight; Or, at the Mount, with some old snarler chimes, In damning wives, and railing at the times. Such is the scene: if then we fetch you down Amusements which endear the smoky town, And through the peasants' poor but useful hands, We circulate the produce of your lands, In this voluptuous dissipated age, Sure there's some merit in our rural stage. Happy the call, nor wholly vain the play, Which weds you to your acres for a day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Hanbury</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. Scene. 1. Cardinal Granvil &amp; Velasco. Gra. Now by my hopes the near Approach of Alva Gives me new Life. Where did you leave the Duke? Velas. At Maestrick my good Lord.â Gra. He comes in time The base revolting Flemings to chastise And purge the State from these rebellious humours Which we have nourish'd to our own destruction. The Duke is of a high &amp; daring Spirit Fit to reform the time; but say, Velasco, What is the strength &amp; Number of his Army? Velas. Ten thousand veteran troupes the flower of Spain And Italyâ Gra. âHe'll find we need them all: Strong Remedies must combat strong Diseases, The Government of Flanders is an Engine Too mighty for a feeble Woman's Sway. Velas. True, &amp; your Eminence was therefore chosen: Your Wisdom &amp; Experience it was hop'd Would have supplied that necessary strength Which female Softness wants.â Gra. âI have served the Princess, As I would serve the Sister of my King; But she has other Counsellors than Granvel. Velas. There came to Philip's court a Flemish Lord Count Egmont, smooth &amp; fluent in his Speech And formed he was to soften &amp; persuade. In glowing Terms he urged his Country's Wrongs Yet temper'd his Complaint with so much Art With such devout professions of Allegiance, The Flemish Faith has grown into Repute And Brussels thought the Seat of Loyalty. Gra. The Seat it is of Faction &amp; Misrule And such will Alva find it; till he comes We stand on tender Ground, &amp; he, who bows not His head to Egmont, shall not wear it long. Velas. I know Count Egmont's power, &amp; know withal He bears your Eminence no loveâ Gra. âVelasco We must endure his Insults for a time, This fond weak Woman cannot long defend him: His day of Retribution is at hand, Spain, whom his crafty Tongue had lulled to sleep, Now shakes the dangerous Delusion off, And views the Traytor with abhorrent Eyes. Velas. The Duke of Alva is possessed against him With bitterest Indignation &amp; imputes This foul Defection of the States of Flanders To his ignoble his insidious Counsells. Gra. And cause there is for Noble Alva's wrath While this proud Fleming rules the Soul of Parma; By lingering Treaties feeds Rebellion's hopes, And keeps the Monarch of the World in Arms. Velas. I have heard, yet none can credit the Report, That public Conference has been held at Antwerp, And terms of Reconciliation offered To the grand Revel William Prince of Orange. Gra. True; &amp; the Man selected to that Office, Raymond, is Egmont's dear &amp; bosom Friend: I know him well, &amp; wear my Eye upon him, A haughty Lord he is factious &amp; proud bold, Impatient of the Yoke, &amp; at his heart The Foe of Spain. I speak to thee Velasco With confidence, for Alva bids me trust thee. Velas. He does me right, your thoughts are safely lodgd In a Castilian's Bosomâ Gra. âTell me now The Duke of Alva will he head his March To Antwerp or to Brussels?â Velas. âIt was thought To Antwerp: which conjecture seems confirm'd By his last movement from Namur to Maestrick. Gra. My Counsel is to speed his March for Brussels. Now get thee in &amp; taste of some Repose, Your Toils demand itâI must hence to Court. Exit Velasco. Manet Granvel. Gra. I know not yet the Duke of Alva's powers; If he's commission'd to displace the Princess, And rule supreme in Brussels, I am His; And Egmont then, nay Parma's self shall feel me, For both alike I hate: But if his Arms Are made the Scaffold to repair &amp; strengthen The tottering Fabrick of her Government, Then must I suffer this Concealment longer, And feed Revenge within my patient bosom And smile on Egmont, till by smooth Approaches I wind myself about his easy heart And sting him to the Soulâ Scene the 2d. Enter Lopez Gra. âHah! whence come You? Why have you left the Part which I assigned you? Lopez. Because I have trac'd Discovery to its Spring And come to lay my Labours at your Feet. Tis now three Years that I have watch'd Count Raymond His Servant in Disguise, but in my heart Thy faithful Creature, &amp; I trust I've slept not In this Employ, but done thee worthy Service. Gra. No more but to the Point. Lop. The Count's a Traytor. Gra. Sayst thou a Traytor? Recollect thyself. Lop. He is a Traytor open &amp; avow'd, A sworn Confederate to the Prince of Orange. Gra. These are wild Words; what Act confirms his Treason? Lop. From the first Conference which he held at Antwerp With the grand Rebel Orange, he became Sullen &amp; mute, deep melancholy seized him, With causeless Gusts of Passion intermixt And childish fears; I noted his disorder And watch'd those moments when the faithless Mind Unbosoms its Contentsâ Gra. âEnough of this; Give me some proof of his assured Desertion. Lop. Bear with me thenâLast night within his Chamber I slept as usual, When ere break of Day I wak'd surpriz'd to find the Count my Master Up &amp; accouterd, underneath his Cloak He wore his Corslet: ere I well could speak He thus accosted meââLopez says he âWith filial Sorrow I have long beheld âMy Country's Wrongs, &amp; now at length resolve âTo join the Friends of Liberty at Antwerp; âYou now are free; this hour we part for ever. Gra. What answer'd you to this? Lop âWith Sighs &amp; Tears I beg'd him to revoke his rash Resolve, I bade him to reflect that t'was no army He sought to join, but a poor needy Rabble That at the first Encounter would disperse. Gra. Did you advise so well?â Lop. âOh t'was all in vain, He knew the weakness of the Prince of Orange And therefore his Assistance was more needfull; I then implored that I might share his fortune Which he forbade but prais'd my honest Zeal; Then bade me give this Letter to Count Egmont; And so we partedâ Gra. âGive me up the Paper, This has some face of proofâBut how my Lopez Shall I discover the Contents? The Seal Is perfect &amp; no doubt well known to Egmont. Lop. It is the private Signet of Count Raymond: And I long since by secret means procured A Copy so exact, the nicest Eye Cannot discern a Difference: With this, Important Matters have I oft Discover'd And with the same Success could now restore The Seal upon that Writing. Gra. Then I'll break it. (Reads) âA Solemn oath hath sever'd me for ever âFrom Spain &amp; Theeâ (Yes &amp; thy Head shall sever From the face I mark it grows on) âRacks &amp; Tortures (How the Fanatic rails) âBut this Granvel âIn everlasting Enmity I holdââ Audacious Heretic!âso much for Raymond. Egmont, thy Fate approaches; Thou wilt meet Thy Ruin in midway; This Man was dangerous And so discerning, that methought he look'd Quite through the hearts of Men; therefore my Soul Abhorr'd &amp; fear'd himâNow observe me well, This Letter, Lopez, must not be deliver'd Till I have seen The Princess &amp; Count Egmont; Take thou the Paper &amp; restore the Seal: I go to Court, wait here till my return; Be faithful &amp; depend upon my bounty. Exit Granvel. Pr. Par. âNow Count Egmont As you expect my favor, tempt him not Scene. 2. Car. Gra. enters to P. Par. Elv. Egm. &amp; other [?] Scene. 2. Gra. Good Morning to your Highness! in these times So fraught with Mischief, each returning Sun Which glads us with its Beams, should hear our Praise. P. Par. Is there ought new abroad?â Gra. âEach Day each hour Prolific brings some recent Crime to light And while we're gazing at the new born Wonder More hideous comes a second Monster forth To strike our Senses with Surprize &amp; Terror. P. Par. The times indeed abound with rank Disorders, But Fire &amp; Sword my Lord are powerful Medicines. I am a poor weak Woman as you know me Not fit for such rough Courses; but there's hope These Ills not cureless, may be yet addrest, And a true Christian Reformation made When Alva's Zeal &amp; your good Prayers conspire. Gra. Tis easier to prevent Complaints than cure 'em. Egm. How?â P. Par. âEgmont what is this?â Gra. âI speak My Fears Lord Egmont nor intend Reproach And when your Friend returns with peace from Antwerp And princely Orange condescends to spare us I shall with joy submit to your Reproof. Egm. I see my Lord where your Decision points And know your Voice has far severer Measures. Gra. Yes I oppos'd (without a Blush I own it) This trifling weak evasive war of words, Nor can approve of other terms for Rebels Than such as free Discretion shall impose. P. Par. What we have done we've doneâA Deed of mercy, Which though unsanctify'd by your consent I never can repent ofâYet Lord Cardinal, So far I'll bend me for your better Judgment, Pass but this day without their due Submission, The next recalls my Minister from Antwerp. Gra. Recall him?âNoâThe Man who can descend To such base Errands is unfit to mix In worthy Councils, to confer with Traitors Is in my judgment to partake their Treason. P. Par. Nay now Lord Cardinal I must reprove you: Call you that Function base which I bestow And your Religion dictates? Come no more You judge too harshly: from my heart I speak it I do not know a Man of clearer fame Of more distinguish'd Loyalty &amp; Honor Than him you glance at, Not yourself my Lord Nor this his Friend who owns him more abhorrs Treason than he does.â Egm. âFrom my Soul I thank you The just Rewards which you bestow on merit Bespeak yourself with kindred virtues grac'd Nor mine alone but a whole Nation's Praises Shall celebrate your Choice.â Gra. âYes a whole Nation Of such ambitious such rebellious Spirits As plot the downfall of this tottering Empire. Is there no bosom worthy to confide in But one where every holy Life [?] is cancell'd? No Tongue impartial in the cause of Truth But one incorporate with a Crew of Traitors To invert this Scyon from its purest Root And wage eternal Enmity with Spain? P. Par. How, what? with Traytors sayst thou? Heard I right? Correct yourself my Lord, your Zeal misleads you: You mean not sure to charge the Count with Treason. Gra. Had I less feeling for the common Safety Was I respectful of Life's short remains I would correct myself, revoke my charge And kneel for Pardon to this angry Lord; For well I know he shall not live who calls His Friend a Traytor, yet He is a Traytor Hell knows who made him one &amp; bound him fast With direfull Curses to its chosen cause. P. Par. Hear'st thou this Egmont? speak if rage will let thee. Egm. How shall I speak when fury choaks my Tongue Or how disprove what I disdain to answer? I know what Envy rankles at thy heart, How thy Soul sickens at the sight of Virtue And what gorss Tales thy Malice can invent. Gra. Here is my heartâIf I assert a Falshood Let it be rent from out my bleeding Bosom, And tost in scorn amongst the hooting Rabble. P. Par. Hah! my Faith reels: Look to your Friend my Lord You told me he was Loyal Brave &amp; honest, I took him on your Word, rewarded, rais'd And trusted himâA Traytor have I trusted? Egm. On my Life noâHe is as far from guilt As this bad Man from Heaven. P. Par. Send for your Friend, And let him answer to the Crime he's charged with. Gra. But will he come?â Egm. âTo thy confusion Granvel. Gra. He will not dare not come. Egm. Hah! dare not come? All judging Power hear &amp; second my Oath. If lea[?]'d with Traytors, my revolted Friend Come not to answer &amp; confute this charge, I here include myself in his Offence: All Commerce with Mankind all mutual Trust, Each Sense that sweetens Life, nay Life itself Here in thy awful Presence I abjure, And yield myself a voluntary Victim To Alva; nay (Oh Infamy!) to Granvel.

      <field name="fulltext">Enter Egmont Lopez Egm. And shall I then do less? Not Granvel then? Granvel enters Gra. Said I the truth &amp; find you not your Friend What I pronounc'd a fugitive a Traytorâ Egm. I find him not; I pry not into faces For specks and flaws, nor take a Man for worse Than what he seems. You, You are the Inquisitor, Whose dark intelligence hath eyes and ears In every house to catch unwary talkers: You are the judge, who cooly can interpret Those indictinct involuntary groans, That burst from dying wretches, and prescribe Confusion, when the lips quivering with anger Utter they know not what to buy remission From tortures insupportable. Gra. My lord You talk You know not what; your rage betrays you. But half a care; for know, though your hot brain May keep no traces of this frantic folly; Yet shall my memory be faithful to You, And register your insultsâwhence art thou (to Lopez) I know thee notâunfold thy name &amp; station. Lop. Lopez my name, a Servant of Lord Raymond's. Gran. Of Raymond's! Fellow, wherefore com'st thou here? This is no place for Traitors: speak thine errand. Lop. If I offend my lord. Gran. If You offend? To the point slave. Lop. Lord Raymond sent me hither. Gran. That's known proceed. Lop. With Letters Gran. Hah! with Letters! Traitor, to whom? Lop. âTo Egmont. Gran. Heav'n and Earth! but this is rank conspiracy. Egmont âAway! Fly to your Duke, and tell him all you know All your malicious falsehood can invent: Tell him I've pity for a brave man's faults And make that pity treason. Gran. Nay my lord Did You not join yourself in Raymond's Crime? Confirm your treason with a solemn oath, Even in the presence of your gracious Princess? I must of force believe You. Egm. O thou!âNo; I will not give a name to thee, nor stain My honor by asserting it to thee: This is the only plea that I shall use; producing a dagger.) Thus armed I bear conviction in my hand, Indifferent to release myself or thee. Gra. Nay then 'tis open war and one must fall. (Exit Granvel.) Scene the 3d. Princess of Parma âElvira To purchase her an hour of Joy &amp; Comfort Princess of P. Granvil here! (Granvil enters in haste.) Gran. Forgive This sudden Interruption, but I fly Breathless with terror from a madman's rage For shelter and defence Prin. of P. Speak who assaults Your sacred character beneath my roof. Gran. One whom no character, no age, no Altar, No shrine, how pure soever, can appallâ Egmont's the fearless the contemptuous man, Whose dagger pointed at my trembling throat, Scarce yet is sheathed. Prin. Par. Stand off and give me way Oh! are You come?â(Egmont meets her and drops on his knee) Is this the mighty man, Hah! is it You that fill my court with treason, You, Egmont, You to bring this shame upon me. Hence from my sightâno safety can be near thee, And when thy wild unbridled rage is loose, Granvel or Parma are alike to thee. Elvira. O all is lostâUndone and lost forever. Egm. No, Madam, no; thus banisht from your sight, This hateful object shall offend no more Parma and Grenvel henceforth are secure. Pr. Parm. Hold, Sir, returnâperhaps I shall not leave Your hands at Liberty, Your life is claim'd And 'tis not thou but justice must dispose on't. Say, my good lord, how sprung this odious fray? Gran. Madam, I scarce can tellâmy frighted spirits Have yet resumed no order or composure. Lord Egmont's less disturbedâOne thing I gather His friend has turn'd to treason and he knows it. P. Parm. Hah! does he know it?âIs your friend a traitor? Thus am I used. What subterfuge is left You? Egm. None, I need noneâI scorn it and disclaim it. P. Parm. Are You dumb too? (To Elvira.) Egm. If fir'd with martial Ardor, And rous'd by liberty's expiring groans, My friend has joind the standard of Revolt, Be it to him the glory or the shame; For me I shall not defend or blame him. Pr. Parm. Yes, You avow his treason, but remember Your bold, rash Oath, and look that You observe it. Egm. I do rememberâPromises and Vows, (Those feeble bonds which priestcraft tears at pleasure) For me are links of steel that honor wraps Round my firm heart and rivets to truth. P. Parm. Talks thou of Truthâthou Traitor? Egm. Hah! thou Traitor? Take heed You make me not indeed a traitor Such as You long may groan forâ Pr. Parm. Guards arrest him. Yet hold; surrender up yourself. Egm. Lo thus. (Breaks it) I throw it to the windsâthe brittle Toy Is now no longer mine. P. Parm. Come my lord Cardinal, Let us from hence.âEgmont, we meet no more. (Exeunt Pr. and Gra.) Egmont and Elvira remain End of the second act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act the Third. Granvel We must pronounce the BlowâI dare not trust This ing woman; she will turn and turn A thousand ways, before the sanded hour-glass Can deal its measure out. She has disgraced him; But, what of that? The first few drisling tears Wash out this stainâwhat confidence in her, Whose revocation still pursues her act As fast as wave does wave? Besides she loves him; And the relapse from anger to forgiveness, Of course recoils beyond it's first extreme Unbars her heart, breaks down its last resolve, And crowns him with possession! It must not be: Therefore they must no moreâenough is done; Her own fair hands laid the foundation stone, (Velasco enters) And I'll complete the workâNow, my Velasco, Are all things ready? You will know this service Will be most grateful to the Duke of Alva, Who hates Lord Egmont in determined hatred. Are You resolved to rid the World and me Of this detested Minion? Velas. My good lord If he escapes before we set him down In Alva's presenceâbe it at my peril If he gets thence he well deserves to live. Gra. It is enough, no more, but strait about it (Exit Velasco) Granvel solus If this attempt is secret, I'll persuade The Princess, that, observant of his Oath, Egmont has yield up himself to Alva: But if discovered boldly own the deed, Pretend the public safety urged me to it, And patiently enjoy the pain it gives her. (exit Granvel) Egmont and Raymond Egm. Away and fear him not. (Granvil enters) Gran. Arest him Guards. Ray. What my old enemy? Fate thou hast caught me. (Exit Raymond with Guards.) Egm. Thou serpent, what whithholds me from thy throat, Why not avenge my friends my Country's wrongs, And rid the groaning Worldâ? Gra. Hah! Hah! Hah! (Exeunt severally) End of the Third act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4t h. Act. Scene the Second. P. Par. till I catch the Substance. Granvel to the Princess of Parma Gra. Alone; in Tears too?âMadam, I intrude. P. Parm. No, my good lord, You are welcome. Gra. I am sorry To see your Highness wear these marks of sorrow On your fair cheeks. Good truth! we need to case Our hearts in steel to combat these rough times Hard task for bosoms soft as your's: To wield The sword of justice asks Herculean Nerves, When bold Rebellion lifts it's shield against it, And threatens proud defiance. P. Parm. True my lord, It asks some firmness to encounter crimes Black as the stygian womb which gave 'em birth And frightful as ingratitude can make them. But school'd by You and hardened by my task I trust to show some reasonable rigour, When fit examples offer. Gra. Let this moment Now put it to the proof. Pr. Parm. Agreed; on whom? Gra. Th'Arch-Rebel Raymond's seized. Pr. Parm. Bring him before me. (Exit Grenvel) Now Pride and Shame and Indignation aid me Egmont shall feel me in the tenderest part, And Justice minister to my Revenge. Scene the Third Prin. of Parm. Granvel and Raymond Pr. of Parm. There's one my lords amongst us that should blush At this encounterâYou make no reply (To Raymond) And do You fix your eyes thus stedfastly On my lord Cardinal?â'Tis You I mean, That conscious of your guiltâBut to say truth, My presence rather ought to chase the blood From your affrighted cheeks, than call it forth: But You appear so easy and assured As if You had no crimes, or felt them not. Raym. That I have crimes and feel them, Heaven's my witness, My sins are numberless; there needs no rack To force that self-inspired confession from me: My conscience in my Inquisitor. Pr. Parm. My lord, Your temporal judge I speak not of offences Against divine, but human laws, My Province Extends no farther. You stand charged, Count Raymond, Of taking Arms with William Prince of Orange And other Rebels more, against the state And Person of my Sovereign Lord and Brother Philip your rightful King. Raym. I see my accuser; And wait my condemnation. Pr. Parm. So impatient For what may come too Soon? Yet let me ask You, (For much it moves my wonder) what delusion, Grand as You was with every splendid favour Which my too partial hand could shower upon You, What fiend could tempt You to this base revolt? Others less favour'd may plead some excuse: There are, whose desperate Fortunes push them on To every rash adventure; whom the dread Of Justice drives to rear rebellion's standard; But thouâto push Prosperity aside And seek assured destruction, to conspire, Leagued with a treacherous crew of needy Outlaws, And hatch Confusion which thyself must share Surpasses all belief; nor can I find, 'Midst the whole Catalogue of human passions A Cause to spur You on. Raym. There is a cause, (A truly noble one) a glorious ardour To prop the reeling Freedom of my country Doubly invaded by the sword of Alva, And the dire shackles of imposing Rome. Granvel Blasphemer, Peace: This insolence of language Accumulates thy guilt. Ray. I own I want That worldly wisdom call'd hypocracy To varnish o'er my deedsâBut 'tis too late Pr. Parm. True 'tis indeed too late; You confidence Excludes my mercy: You assert, my Lord, That for your country's sake You take up arms, The Rebel's vulgar plea: Ingrateful Man! Where is the act of mine You can complain of? Yourself have known them all and committed most. To nurse the rightful liberties of Flanders, To lead her smoothly in the paths of duty, And lightly sway my delegated sceptre, Has been my ceaseless care. Raymond Perish the Man! That can impute Oppression to thy nature: No 'tis the Yoke of unrelenting Alva Which we complain of; 'tis the assertive spirit Of brave Montigny and his guiltless friends That calls us forth in Arms: it is the dread Of Racks of Tortures and the direful Office Where this fell Tyrant reigns; tis the abhorrence Of the Soul's slavery, which bids us rise And perish rather by the swords of Alva, Than feast the Eyes of sanguinary Priests. Gran. But You my Lord had no such martial Fury, Destined to meet a more ignoble Death, You fled his presence in the paths of honor. Raym. Foe as thou art to every tender feeling, I scorn to urge the friendship that undid me: To save a guiltless man and disappoint Thy arts is gain tho' purchased with my life But thou, whose heart, tho' shielded by his rigour Knows and approves my Motives. Pr. of Parm. Come no more; Spite of my wrongs, I must confess Thee noble, Concessions more than this expect not from me Justice demands thy life; in me to spare Were to partake thy guilt. Hence to thy prison, I must not bid thee hope. Granvel- Yet under favor (Discoveries of importance being made) The public safety will admit of pardon You will remember Count where I surprised You; Disclose your guilty friendship; 'tis an Act Of Justice to the State, and may attone For wrongs, which else your death alone can cancel. Ram. I know thy thirst for Blood for Egmont's blood, But when thy racks can force me to accuse A guiltless friend; may my soul sink to tortures Dreadful as those which are reserved for thee (Exit Raymond) Granvil Insolent wretch! each hour this traytor lives Is a fresh stab to Justice. What prevents Immediate Execution, since he scorns Our proffer'd terms and glories in his Crimes? Pr. Parm. Fear not, my lord, your vengance shall be sated, But wait my orders. (Exit P. Parma Granvel I submit with patience. This looks auspiciously; but still I doubt A woman's firmness. By a public Fate To cut him off were best; but other means Must be provided in reserveâAlive Hence he departs no more: And yet my vengance How incomplete, while Egmont lives? 'Tis true The Death of Raymond stings him to the heart; Why that is wellâTo drive him to distraction, And out of thatâWou'd Alva were arriv'd; These arts were needless then: I must employ Lopez; 'tis true he knows too much already; But there are ways to seal his lipsâHe's here. Scene the Fourth Granvil &amp; Lopez. Granvil. Well, Lopez, Fortune smiles upon our work The Princess or affects a constancy, Or has it: By a public death to morrow I trust that Raymond fallâyet, O my friend Whilst Egmont lives what joy can Granvel feel? Destroy him &amp; be all my Power can make You. Lopez. Who guards the Prison? Gra. The Castilian Band. Lopez Where is Velasco? Granvel Gone with suden Pride Back to the Camp: what moved him to it I know not; But it is thought a slight disgrace received From our imperious Princess; the dull drone I could have spared at any other time. Lopez. The freakish sallies of Castilian pride Who can expound? Contemptible resentment! But say my lord, is not the heart of Egmont Warm, open, indiscreet? Granvel It is. What then? Lopez. Why then I'll move him to attempt the Rescue Of his imprisoned friend. Granvil Hah! that is something. Lopez. This act of fury by your care defeated Throws your unguarded rival on your mercy; Divests the Princess of the power to save him, And quickens Raymond's death. Granvil Or say, my Lopez, Amidst the wild disorder of the fray, Might not some friendly hand be found to strike This well-aimed dagger to the Heart of Egmont? (Producing a dagger) Lopez Hah! to the Heart? Gran. Yes, Lopez, to the Heart. Lopez Nay but 'twill grieve thee. Gran. Oh! 'twill glad my soul. Lopez. Art sure of that? What strike it to the heart? Thou wilt relent &amp; curse me for the deed. Gran. Oh, never, never; thou shalt be my hero, My friend Lopez. I've strong temptations to the deed: Egmont has done me wrong. Granvel Revenge it then. Lopez. Shall it be so; or say'st thou this to prove me, And practice on my spirit? Granvil No, by Heav'n! Serious as death; if thou would'st be revenged, Thou handlest that, which in a brave man's grasp Would not be idle long. Lopez. I'll do it; he dies. Granvil Why this is well: Be constant! Let us hence And in a fitter place consult upon it. Lopez. Your patience good my Lord, if I presume Again to urge my former suit to You Some portion of the traitrous Raymond's fortune My services without a boast may claim Granvel Claim, say'st thou? Lopez Do I use too bold a phrase? When by my Industry the whole was gain'd Am I too sanguine to expect a part? Granvel How, Lopez, would You make conditions with me? Remember Raymond lives and Egmont lives: Remember likewise what and where I found You, Sinking beneath accumulated guilt And crusht with Penury, Despair and Shame. No more of this: Think humbly of thyself, As it becomes thee. Follow me. (Exit) Lopez Thou villain! Blast me, ye fires of Heav'n if I forgive him! (Exit)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act the Fifth Scene the First. P. Parma, Granvel, Egmont &amp; Raymond. P. Par. My Lord, your last Night's melancholy lodging Inspired, I trust some seasonable reflexions, And duly humbled your too lofty spirit. I see the Marks of an ingenuous shame, And gratulate repentance in your looks: When last we met, embolden'd by despair You scorn'd my mercy, revil'd my Faith; Superior to the insults of the guilty, I looked with pity on your hopeless state; 'Twas decency, discretion You offended, Nor anger'd me, but as You harm'd yourself. Raym. If warm by nature and incensed with wrongs My tongue with too much licence spoke my feelings Pr. Parm. Attempt not an excuse; 'twas not for this I summon'd You again, nor that I needed More ample confirmation of your guilt But to convince You that your boasted cause Of Liberty is but Rebellion's mask; That all the mighty wrongs you trumpet forth Are baits to catch the Rabble, that You rail Against oppressions which no man can feel, And cry down tyrany which has no being But what You give it. Raym. Tempt me not so far, But take my life; 'tis all You can demand P. Parma No, I would punish You with my forgiveness And triumph o'er You with your own example. Granvel For Heav'n's sake what intend You? Egm. To preserve him And disappoint thy savage thirst of blood. Gran. It cannot beâthe State demands his life. Egm. A Christian Prelate, and object to Mercy? Gran. If such offenses are let loose amongst us Farewell to Law to Justice &amp; to Empire! P. Parm. Fear not, my lord, the law shall be obey'd That perfect Law, which renders Good for Ill. Egm. Mark this Lord Cardinal, You have Your answer P. Parm. Hear then the mild Conditions of my Mercy: Renounce the faction of Rebellious Orange; Swear absolute Allegiance to the State, And join the Banners of your rightful Prince. Ray. Hah! P. Parma Do You hesitate? Raym. Is this the price That I must pay for Life? P. Parma. These are the terms That Justice &amp; the general good exact: Slight compensation for a Monarch's wrongs This temporal attonement made, my Lord, You still stand open to the Church's censure (Where You my Lord may Judge) in that You abett The Heresy of Luther, with whose Doctrines You and your faction grossly are infected Gra. Your Highness breathes a truly Christian Zeal. Yes, Sir, Your privat haunts have been discovered Dark as You are, You're seenâAnd doubt it not, Rome has convenient methods in resource At once to chasten &amp; confute your Folly. Egm. Yes the dire force of those infernal engines Which Rome triumphant o're the suffering World, Madly employs to combat Truth and Reason Too well we know; and curst be your invention! Granvil Impious, Reviler, Peace! P. Parm. Madman, No more, Ray. Come take my life, and with it my disdain, Death cannot be so hateful as thy presence (To Granvil O my lov'd friend, receive my last embrace; Come &amp; behold me triumph at my Death; See, how contentedly thy friend can lay Life's burden down &amp; smile upon the Rack P. Par. Go get ye hence brave but unhappy Men Away &amp; never let me see you more, For you my Lord who will not let me save you Death is your doom; Heaven fit you to receive it.

Gra. &amp; Raym. Scene the Third Princess of Parma Elvira Granvil Parm. My Lord I'd have You to suspend a while Count Raymond's execution for some Reasons Have made this temporary Respite needful. Granvil I thought how soon You would revoke this sentence P. Parm. You thought? I am not to hear your thought: What if I bid You set him free? Granvil You must not. P. Parm. Must not? What means this insolence? Gra. Alass! You but expose a weakness You should hide Your cause is sold; my orders are from Alva, The Regent now of Flanders and my master: If yet You doubt, this night this welcome Night Shall bring the Heroe to ca[??]ting Brussels, His Power establish and determine thine. Parm. Why now you speak your heart without disguise; Obscured no more by my opposing power, Your soul breaks forth in Colour all its own. Alas the many wretches that shall feel Thy pityless resentments! Hapless Raymond!â But think me not so tame; he shall not die. I'll snatch at least one victim from your grasp And, as in acts of mercy it commenc'd So shall my Power expire. Granvil You are deceived The Troops that guard him are of Alva's army, Castilian Soldiers and defy surprise. This night, this hour he falls; no he alone; But Egmont's lofty head shall kiss the block Pr. Parma Hence from my sight, nor with this bold Intrusion Dare to insult the sister of thy King. But now so much You seem'd as [?] to endure The Eye of Royalty, but shrunk before it: What mighty revolution has inspired This arrogance? Has your new Regent taught You? He dare not do it: flushed with the foolish hope Of Alva's vain support, You have forgot Me and yourself; yourself the merest upstart That ever fortune wantonly made great; And me the daughter of the mightiest Monarch That ever sway'd a Sceptre. Hence, nor dare To touch the Lives of those whom I protect As You respect your own. Granvel I know my duty And shall fulfil itâExit Scene the Fourth P. Parm. But something worthy of my self and Egmont Exeunt. Granvil alone Hark! the Alarm's begunâThis plot of Lopez Will sure succeed; and yet had I foreseen Alva's arrival, I had built my projects On surer ground: So Egmont falls 'tis well; No matter by what means. Now Fortune for us! Would it were overâWhat strange Indiscretion, To lay myself so open to the Princess And vent a fruitless spleen! Had it been done Thus to have crush'd her with the dreadful news That Egmont was no more; then to have sounded My triumphs in her earsâO glorious transport! Exquisite vengeance!âBut to prate and wrangle And boast of Projects e're they are have a being, Fie, fie upon it. hark! they are at hand I hear the clash of many mingling swords. Grant Heav'n that Lopez may not have betraid me. Who knows what desperate Valor may effect What shall I do? in this decisive Moment Unarm'd I will advance; perhaps my presence May cheer the fainting spirits of my party And turn the dubious fortune of the Fray (Exit) Lop: Were shamed Defeated Scene the Sixth Lopez Lopez. The planets in their courses shrink for horror Heaven drops natural tears Granvil and Lopez. Granvil Lopez what news? Lopez. Ill news Lord Cardinal, the counts are fled Gran. Confusion! fled? Lopez. By desperate Valour fir'd They hew'd their passage thro' opposing numbers. Granvel Thy trickery Villian, not their valour sav'd them But wretch thy Life shall answer it. Lopez. My life Has answered it (worse fate for me!) behold! Alas, my lord, I tremble; I expire. Lend me your Arm and bless me e're I part. Granvel Son, die in peace. Lopez Die first thyself, thou Villian Granvel Oh! I am slain! (They struggle) Lopez. Take that to make it sure. (Stabs him again and he falls Granvel Oh! hold thy hand, bloody, relentless Villian What hast thou done? Lopez I have done Mankind a service. Granvil So kind a master!âsayâinfernal Wretchâ What fiendâinspiredâthis sacrilegious act? Lopez. Say'st thou what fiend?âRevenge; the bloodiest fiend That walks Hell's pavement. When thy sordid Heart With Lion-like division seized the spoil Of Raymond's fortune and refused my wish For some small share of what my toils had earn'd Then in that instant I decreed thy death, And now my Vengance has performed it's office Hah! art thou dead? my sword has found thy Heart Tho' Mercy never could.
