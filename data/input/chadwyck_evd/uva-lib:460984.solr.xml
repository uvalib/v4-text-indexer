      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âThe Mainland of Zetland. The seashore. Harold stretched on the ground; Northmen standing near; Mermaidens heard singing from the sea. Mer. She is dead! she is dead! Our darling is dead! We heard it! we heard it! we heard the loud cry, Which back with the waves, Rushed out of thy caves, Oh, Zetland! as all thy stern heroes went by, With the song for the dead, with the death-march's tread, And laid her to sleep like a child in its bed. She is dead! she is dead! We shall linger no more, Tost by the sigh of the seas to and fro, In the green gloom of shade, By the tall granite laid Over the ripple that murmurs below, To see the sweet face smiling down, as of yore, From her nest on the heights, o'er the sea and the shore. Like the bold eagle which darts from the sky, To snatch the babe from its mother's cries, Suddenly lighting down from on high, Death has flown off with his golden prize! Eagle, that plunderest north, south, east, west, Why hast thou plundered thy brother's nest? Now, where shall we meet with her desolate ghost? In the long winding silence of sea-caverns lost, Where, past the first bend, black night arches o'er us, Our sole guide the splash of the wildfowl before us? Who shall dare float through these chambers unknown, To meet the poor phantom wandering alone? Or will the orphan spirit come soon, And through those loopholesâlike the moonâ Shine full upon the rugged stairs Of the old Pict castle, unawares? Or, fluttering aloft on some rock like a tower, Cut off from the land by the current's mad run, Just seen from below in some strange stormy hour, Flash like a seagull's white wing in the sun? Or round the abyss hover, pitying in vain, Whilst the fowler ascends with his fast coming breath, And marks the rope crack to the slow-tugging strain, And life waits above him, and death waits beneath? Why did she die, Our beautyâah why? We saw him draw near to the poor shrouded sleeper, And the last bitter look He silently took, Of the one face he lovedâwhy could we not keep her? Fair-haired Sea King! Oh, down didst thou fling The strength and the pomp of thy stature, to lie With forehead close hid from the pitying skyâ Thine arms, that were forged on Thor's anvil, thrown byâ To lie like a war-weary giant asleep, Not a pulse, not a breath, not an eyelash astir! We sing and we weepâwe sing and we weepâ But Harold is breaking his great heart for her. Rising up slow, From the clear deep below, Through glittering gradations of azure and green, In a moonlight of tresses, With voice that caresses, Speak to him, sing to him, Astrid, our queen! Enter Astrid from the sea. Ast. Harold, my king, my brother! it is I. Cast like a warrior's sword upon the floor, No man dares speak to thee, none dares draw nigh Thy three days' trance upon the thundering shore, Harold, my king, my brother, none but I! Speak to me, brother! Break thy heart no more! Mer. She is dead! she is dead! On the rough granite floor they have pillowed her head And left her to sleep, like a child in its bed, And wave after wave, From cave into cave, Restlessly rushes to break on her grave! Ast. Oh, my Norse eagle! oh, my own sea-king! For one lost beauty wilt thou furl thy wing? Hark how Atlantic storms, with mad war-whoop, Scourge league on league of billows, roar on roar, Nor draw one breath till all come crashing up, With shocks of hissing thunder, to the shore! From crest to crest the petrel lightly mounts, Seeking, across the uproar and the foam, The bark which danced to the mad music once, Like a young maiden in her halls at home! We miss thee only in those nights of revel, When the mast cracks, and heaven is white with fire, Ere tortured ocean has cast out his devil, And trembles to the tremblings of my lyre. Ah, when he sobs down into rest, all over, Shall not the fountain of thy canvass soar, Like beauty smiling o'er a vanquished lover, Above the azure heavings, as of yore? Mer. She is dead! she is dead! On the rough granite floor they have pillowed her head, And left her to sleep like a child in its bed, And wave after wave, From cave into cave, Restlessly rushes to break on her grave! Ast. Shall dangerous mystery beckoning o'er the sea, Have never, never more a charm for thee? Hast thou forgot the unknown, dreadful pole, The secret that in silence waits thee thereâ Less silence than a whisperâearth's great soul Hushed, as to gaze upon a god's despair? Think of the awful ecstacy, to glide Out of this world, its noise, and glow, and glory, Like a lone sea-bird with white wing spread wide, Through wastes of winter with an untold storyâ Past the tall icebergs, slowly stalking near, Like the world's ancient ghosts, to scare thee back; Past all the white, wierd creatures, that appear Formed of the snow whereon they leave their track; Past lilac spire and pale blue pinnacle, In long array against the sky set forth, Like phantoms of the cities where men dwell, Into the midmost horror of the North! Then, silently, the charm dissolved, steal home, As one that has beheld with living breath, Beneath the starry gloom of winter's dome, A mystery, like the mystery of death! Mer. She is dead! she is dead! The diamonds sparkling around her sweet head, Sparkle in vain from her dark prison-bed, Where none comes to gaze, Save the ghosts of old days, That crowd round the silent new guest, in amaze. Ast. Or, 'neath the sky's sweet changes, each unrolled, Like banners, o'er the war-march of thy youth, Glide into bluer blue, more golden gold, And reach the pageant of the painted south! On warm and glittering waters seek again The rapture fresh as youth, and ever new, When eyes, worn with the sparkle of the main, Wake to see mountains towering o'er the blue. Yes, seek again the battle's purple storm, Where life and death meet with a thunder-cry, The bounding blood, with victory wild and warm, The contest o'er, and heroes smiling by! Up and away for the blue distance! There, For thee, the palace gates of beauty shine, And danger's dazzling sword is ever bare To guard the brides of earth from Odin's line. Mer. She hears not the din As th' Atlantic rolls all his great tide slowly in, To knock at the door of the sleeper within. Ast. All loveliness sleeps not within one tomb! Sweet human smiles, sweet flushing human cheeks, Hues that in cold sea-deeps may never bloom, Are waiting still for him who bravely seeks. Mer. Though close to her ear He murmurs his secret, she never will hear, Nor, loud as he thunders, will tremble for fear. Ast. Through all the changes of her island hours, I have lingered oft on white-cliffed England's strand, And loved to watch unfold its blush-rose flowers The sweet and stately girlhood of the land; Or, floating slow 'neath Andalusian skies, Marked, o'er the dove-like flutter of a fan, With fiery-smiling spells, how Spanish eyes Caress into their chains the soul of man; Or, further yet along the moonlit sea, Filled with fond envy of those human charms, Beneath the marble of some balcony, Dreamily halted in the summer calmsâ Made glorious by a proudly balanced head, Wreathed in the serpent of its own black hair, Lips with all warm and generous beauty red, And cheeks embrowned by rich Italian air! Oh, these are left thee still, earth's noblest daughters! Up! spread thy sails, bring back some queen to me, For whom I'll tune a jubilee of waters, And crown her with the phosphor of the sea! Mer. She is dead! she is dead! Ast. Oh, brother whom I love! oh, hero-heart! My mermaid-mother's darling long ago, What time in crystal halls we dwelt apart, Beneath the roar of ocean's ebb and flow! Cradled in granite, first-born of creationâ Whose childhood danced above the fires confined In smouldering wrath beneath the world's foundation, Till called to burst in thunder on mankind! Mer. She is dead! she is dead! On the rough granite floor they have pillowed her head, And left her to sleep like a child in its bed. Ast. Alas! alas! and must I tell to thee The secret I would fain for ever hide, Because, oh woe! of all that I foresee, When her true fate thou know'st that should have been thy bride. Mer. She is dead! she is dead! Ast. And now I see thy destiny roll up Its sable thunder-cloud above thy head, Silently, whilst I fill for thee a cup Of fatal joyâfor Gemma is not dead! Mer. What a cry! what a bound! As he springs from the ground, And the Northmen in wonder draw silently round. Know ye what word Of miracle, stirred The prostrate despair that saw not nor heard? Har. Where is she? where? Ast. Fled toward th' Ãgean sun, Fled to her own Ãgean isle once more, The isle her childhood saw with carnage run, Ere thou couldst snatch her to thy wintry shore! Har. But howâhow fled she? Ast. She is carried southâ Tranced in the magic death which fooled our eyesâ By that dark-featured and sweet-speaking youth, Who came from Venice with a tale of lies, Whilst thou wert far away, tossed under thundering skies. Har. Why did she leave me? Ast. Faithfully guarded on her dizzy rock, He knew how well from him the prize was hid, So by a treacherous scheme planned to unlock The treasure from its jealous casket-lid. Can thy pent wrath bear moreâbear to hear how He charmed thy beauty from thy guarded hall, By a false gift which sparkled on her brow, That ghastly day thou met'st her funeral? The unseen stranger's homage pleased thy childâ Those beauteous jewels from beyond the sea Her guileless fancy easily beguiled, That dreamt not of an enemy to thee. So when she stood with diamond-crowned head, The mirror saw the joy upon her face Each moment blush to a more rapturous red, Smile on her lips with more ecstatic grace. It seemed, when that fantastic charm began, As if an unseen lamp, hung high in air, Flashed witchlights o'er her with a fiery fan, And spirit wings waved lightly her wild hair. But suddenlyâas if an unseen hand Had quenched that lightâceased that mysterious stir, That noiseless flutterâthe rich beauty wanned, And a false death dropped its pale mask on her. Thou cam'st to find her deadâ'twas all thou saw'stâ Thou didst not guess a false Italian spell In those witch-gems, chilled what they touched to frost, Beneath whose veil life lay invisible. Next, from her burial-vaultâoh, how it glares In those blue eyes, the Berserker's mad rage!â He bore the sleeper where soft southern airs Shall thaw the pale life from its icy cage, And she shall wear once more the island-crown Her knightly fathers won and handed down. Har. Oh, Astrid! Astrid! Astrid! this thou knew'st! Thou knew'st all this, and didst not tell it me! Oh, Odin! god and father! pity me! I was not there to tear him limb from limb! Lightning from heaven! oh, blind these eyes of mine, Or let them see my vengeance! Oh, right hand! Be palsied, if thou dost not slay this man! E'en now, perhaps, she calls me in dismayâ How shall I pardon thee? Ast. Yet pardon me! I knew it not, till one of my sea-sprites, That met the robber-galley on the sea, Swam swiftly through unresting days and nights, To tell the secret of her fate to me. Oh, Harold! my belov'd! an unknown woe Lies in the distance whither thou wilt go. Har. Tell me once moreâshe went not of her will? Ast. As little as the soul which, slain on earth, Wakes wondering on the further shore of timeâ So will she reach the island of her birth, And take fresh root in that forgotten clime. Ah, 't is not for thy good this tale I tell, Yet arm thee, spread thy sails, and fare thee well! Har. Farewell, farewell, my sister!âBlow, ye winds! Now does the warrior heart blaze forth again, From what I thought was ashes!âBlow, ye winds! Storm-high behind the wings of my sea-ravens, And whirl me to recovery and revenge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âNaxos. A State Apartment of the Ducal Palace. Gemma reclining on the throne in a trance. Zilia and Lorenzo standing beside her. Archbishop of Naxos, Lioni, and other Naxiote Nobles. Naxiotes singing in the street below. Song. [Naxiotes] Oh, long-lost beauty, risen On these Ãgean isles! Like spring from winter's prison, In all her youth of smiles! Like some rare bud safe storÃ«d In a cold vase, by night, To bloom on a bride's forehead, In a full noon of lightâ Like a lost ring, whose giver Endeared it o'er all rings, Which back the breathless diver To beauty's footstool bringsâ Like gold long buried under A cedar-shadowed ground, Which, starting back in wonder, The miser's heir has foundâ Or like some relic holy Saved out of pagan lands, Through shouting streets borne slowly To the holy father's handsâ From gray rocks and pale ocean, From white and heartless snows, From frozen joy and motion, Comes back to us our rose! Zil. Now, lords of Naxos, look upon this sleeper, New rescued by my son from wintry exile Beside her enemy's hearth! Look on her, all, And own her for the orphan of your Duke And lady of these isles! Nax. (singing) Happy, happy rover! Happy, happy lover! Studying love upon a sleeping face, All those weeks and weeks Whilst she never speaks, Keeps her place with soft submissive grace. Zil. First, reverend prelate, Will you draw near? Archb. Mine eyes are dim with age, Oh lady! but a light that shines on them, As from a dear and royal presence, tells me, This costly rose of girlhood is the same Small bud of beauty that was once of yore Placed in my hands, with music and acclaim, Thence to receive the rain of baptism. Sweet is this consolation for that day When all the city brought in mourning pomp The slaughtered heroes of her house, to lie Beside their fathers, and I blessed the dead, Whilst scarce the requiem drowned the people's sobs. Nax. (singing) When the bluer skies Warm those close-veiled eyes, Lo, she blushes back the blushing south! He discerns it well, Though he scarce can tell Which was first to redden, cheek or mouth. Dreams begin to stir A faint life in her, Shining through her trance with tremulous glory, And the half-freed prisoner Lies like a pleased list'ner To the murmur of a long love-story. Zil. And you, oh, veteran champion of your lord! Who won his knightly spurs beneath your eyes, And from your hand had knightly consecrationâ Is this the child for whom on a past day You stood an honoured sponsor at his side? Lio. Princess, my heart with an unbounded joy Adoring this girl-miracle of beauty, Beholds in her the infant whose small hand I kissed that day, whilst her stern father smiled, And her sweet mother wept, and both for joy. Me, too, this sight consoles for a dark hour When wounded I awoke as from the dead, Maddened with rage and grief to find my prince And his brave sons changed to heroic dust, Our darling lost, our throne without an heir. Nax. (singing) Blank to her hath been All the shifting sceneâ Past the rock-bound channel's stormy gray. Past the one red spark Straining through the dark, From the eyes of England toward Biscay. Through the narrow door, Gliding in secure, Down the southern gallery sublime, Where, in sky-framed row, God hung long ago Master-pictures on the walls of time. Zil. Now all of you draw near and look upon her, Ere we awake her to the wild surprise In wait for her. Is she not one indeed Worth the allegiance of your heart's best blood? All. She is! she is! the wonder of the world! And proudly thus we bend the knee to her! Nax. (singing) Gay Granada bright With half Afric's light; Provence blooming under porphyry walls; Genoa smiling down 'Neath her marble crown, On th' adoring sea where her white image falls; Dark as demon's woe, Ãtna raising slow A grim head from his gay green disguise; Naples, all the day, Dreaming life away, Spell-bound by Vesuvius' burning eyes; Venice all alone On her floating throne, Like a marble lily of the Nile, From her Adrian palace Watching her gay galleys Fly to the world's end, like lovers for a smile. Zil. Here's yet another witness to her birth! Ah, old Eudora! what prophetic instinct Has guided to this spot thy tottering steps? Nax. (singing) Swerving not for those, On the rover goes, Till a purple sky-aspiring line Sharply cuts the air, And 't is Greece stands there, Greece, aerial, spirit-like, divine! Eud. Who's this, who's this, that with those drooping eyes, 'Mid all her wild gold tresses, sits so mute Upon the knightly throne of my dear lord? Why do you bend the knee before a corpse? Zil. Look closer, old Eudora! 'Tis no corpse, But a fair girl asleep. Eud. Then wake her not, For she will wake to sorrow. Zil. You are wrong, She will awake to be your sovereign. She is your master's daughter. Eud. Let me see her! Alas! poor child, this is no world for thee! Thou art too beautiful. Sleep on, sleep on, And never wake again! Zil. Lead her away. Nax. (singing) Sweeping lightly round, In behold him bound On the crowd of happy Cyclades, Ready where they stand, Circling hand in hand, For their wild Romaika on the seas. Zil. Now, noble lords, I thank you for your coming, And pray that you will leave us, while my son Removes the spell that holds your princess chained. [All go out, except Zilia, Lorenzo, and Gemma. My silent son, now will you lift the wreath From this enchanted brow? Why do you pause? Lor. Once done, 't is done for ever. Nax. (singing) Dancers of the sea, Quit your gameâ't is she, Come to wear her diadem of isles! [Lorenzo lifts the wreath from Gemma's forehead. Crowd around with song, Whilst she glides along! Watch her walking! Lo! she wakes and smiles! Song. Sweet wand'rer! thy palace is lighted for thee, The white-terraced mountain-side bursts into stars! Street after street, to the boats on the sea, Rings with the revel of countless guitars! From marble-carved window to window, blaze out Beautiful faces scarce seen there beforeâ The heart of the islands bursts into a shout Like th' Ãgean's own organ-voiced roar. Hail, 'tis thy heritage! Thine is the town Caught in the net of its vines like a prize, A wide leafy cage where sweet gardens shut down, Each its own summer of shade, from the skies. There, breaking out from the green trelliced prison, The plantain spreads out its torn streamers in showers, The cypress stands stern as a spectre just risen, Rose-laurel mounds blush over with flowers. Up to the promontories carry thine eye, Gleaming with orange-tree foliage, around Whose sculptural curves the sea makes a sky, Each with its bride-wreath still crowned and recrownedâ Or wilt thou descend to the gay market square, Blooming and dewy with flowers and fruit, Ere noon shall have mounted her blue sultry stair, And watched till the brightness is empty and muteâ Or balconied lines of pebble-paved street, And white narrow lanes where the dark shadows fall, And perfumed surprises steal into the heat, Out from an ambush of windowless wall With inlets mysteriousâthe half-open door, Or high-arching portal whose grating discloses Cool, fragrant glimpses of walks bowered o'er With thickets of heliotropes, jasmines, and roses. Now to the mountains! Past olive and vine, Past all the chestnut-woodsâhigher up still To where the free thickets of evergreens shine, And a black pall of cedars from hill spreads to hill. And oh, the wild scent of the soil, gather'd up By myrtle and cistus, by heath, balm, and thyme, And breathed through an air fresh and joyous as hope, Clear, pure, and sweet, as the mass-bell's great chime! Nowâcarved by the moon, in a marble as white As shines in the quarries of Paros hard by, Not like the ghost which, veiled in thin light, Walks, as in sleep, 'neath a cold northern sky, But day's perfect statue, the world of the night Stands in its pride, like a queen doomed to die. And all is thine own! Day or night, dark or bright, The isles of th' Ãgean are thine, far and nigh!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âThe Ducal Palace. A room overlooking the sea. Zilia and Lorenzo. Courtiers assembled. Lor. The crowd waits eagerly below to see her. Will she not come? Zil. Still, in her robing room, Impatiently submits she to the hands Of her attendant maidens. Whither go you? Lor. I will withdraw me to the outer room, And, lost amid th' assemblage, watch the scene. I choose not yet to meet her eye in public. Zil. My fortunate son, I will not leave this isle, Till I have placed your beauty's hand in yours, And seen you happy in the latest triumph Of your ambitious youth. Full hard to please, My son indeed must be, if not at last Content with fate. Lor. Content is not the wordâ I know not if th' uneasy charm which holds me Have more of joy or trouble, hope or fear. Zil. I think you are in love with her bright eyes Almost as much as her bright diadem. Is it not so? Lor. I love herâyes! and yet Against my willâso often have I vowed To love no more. Zil. Behold, she comes at last! [Lorenzo withdraws. Enter Gemma and Attendants. Fair Princess, know you that your subjects wait Eager to see you? Gem. Glorious, glorious sea! Oh, world of wonders! and oh, greatest wonder, That you should not be always wondering As I do! Zil. Now your long, long dream is over, 'T is time that you no more should look and move The wild barbaric fairy of the north, But the grave, gracious sovereign of an isle That humbly worships you, nor must you waste The hours in raptures o'er the sun and flowers Of your new realm. Wake, be no more a child! Gem. But I am ever, ever in a dream, And ever, ever happy...... Zil. Hark! Nax. (singing) Vainly, oh, beautiful mystery, to thee We crowd with our songs and our lifted up eyes, Not one golden spark from our star, can we see Start from behind the blank blueness of skies. Blown light from the sea as a fancy in dreams, In the dark of the night she stole on our shore; We saw not, but know it was she, for she seems To spread a light round us, we felt not before. We saw not, nor see her! we dream pictures of her, Our hearts round the gates of her palace keep guard, We gaze with an envying awe on her lover For whom we behold those great portals unbarred. Zil. Now let me lead you to the windowâcome! Be not afraid! let all the people see you! Nax. (singing) Was it thou, living dream? oh, that rapture of smiles, That hurry of blushes, that brown gold of hair! Our own darling orphan, the child of our isles, Our beauty, our Gemma, was 't thou who stood'st there? There, in that window! we scarce can believe it, The frame looks so blank now the picture is gone! Oh, how we wished that she never might leave it, But, smiling and blushing, still smile and blush on. Zil. Where go you, wild one? stay, my Princess, stay! [Exit Gemma. Where has she flown? as well call back the blossom The wind blew from the bough! Fresh from the mermaids, Be not surprised your pretty little Duchess Has not yet learnt the civilized code of custom Which gives the law to life. Hark, there's her voice! I hear it from that grove of rhododendrons. Scene II. âThe Palace Gardens. Gemma singing. Lorenzo approaches unperceived. Gem. (singing) Bird, whose silver wing is wet From the foam of yonder sea, Tell me, tell me, hast thou met Him who spreads his sails for me? Tell me thou who skimm'st the deep, How long must I watch and weep? Hast thou met him where the warm Waveless ocean gasped for air? Hast thou met him in the storm, With his stately masts all bare? Tell me, thou that skimm'st the deep, How long must I watch and weep? Yes, I 've met his sails of snow Many a time on yonder sea! Ever when the winds did blow, There amidst the storm was he! Now, let ocean smile or roar, I shall meet his sails no more! Tell me where thou saw'st him last, Tell me, wand'rer of the sea! On a rock his ship was castâ Guess, but ask not, where was he! Leave thy watching on the shoreâ Thou shalt see his sails no more. Lor. Why will you sing these Danish songs? Gem. Oh me! How softly you approachedâI never heard you! Lor. A creature winged like Gemma can be caught Only by cunning. Why will you sing always These Danish songs? Gem. Because I know no othersâ I learnt them from the mermaidsâand besides You mock my accent when I try Venetianâ Now sing to me. Lor. The only songs I know Are sad ones, and bring back sad memoriesâ I have no joy in music. Gem. Ah, how strange! Do all sweet things then pain you? Lor. 'T is my nature. E'en when I stand before a happy future, The past is always lingering in the background, And fascinates mine eyes, 'spite of myself. Gem. Are you unhappy then? now, even now? Lor. Yes, now, sweet Princess. Gem. Why? Lor. Because I know not If you would miss me were I now to leave you, And never more return. Gem. You leave me! you! Lor. Sweet Gemma, if you bid me, I will stay. Gem. What should I do, how live, if you were gone? Lor. So cruel am I, I could almost go, To have the joy of knowing that you missed me. Gem. How strange I missed you not before I knew you? Lor. See, you were like that wreathing trumpet-flower Which loiters idly o'er the balustrade, Till it has found yon cypress, round whose spires It clings with all its blossoms. And, in truth, That moment when I lifted from your brow, With such a beating heart, the magic wreath, And the clear, sea-like purple of your eyes, Dawned dazzlingly upon your startled face, You seemed in me to find the thing you soughtâ Methought your blush was like a half-shy child's That hides its face and smiles. It was as if You had been dreaming of me all the time, And were but half awake. Gem. And so I was! Oh, had I words to tell you how I felt, That moment in my life's eventless story, Which flashed upon me its first novelty. It seizes on me suddenly againâ Whene'er I see you unawaresâas 't were For the first timeâthat flash of warm blue sea Beyond the balcony, seen through green leaves As through a bower; the curving mountain side, The strange rich colouring spread o'er its broad canvass; The hot and perfumed sunshine, and all round The softened uproar of a crowd of bellsâ And you yourselfâyou smiled on me so sweetly, And said such strangely sweet and graceful things... I loved you from that moment without knowing it. Lor. And I had loved you long before it. Oh! How anxiously, impatiently, I watched you! Whene'er I passed in sight of land, there came A restless dread lest other eyes should catch A glimpse of my one treasure! Gem. But how was it You took such pains to seek and carry off A bride you had not seen? Lor. 'T was an adventure Which roused the fancy of a man just then Weary of all he saw. Had you been guarded By all the boisterous giants of Valhalla, I should have ventured still. Yet, when I neared Fulfilment of my aim, my mind misgave meâ Shall I confess it, Gemma? I began To tremble lest the hidden gem of Zetland Should prove not worth the outlay of such hopes, Lest you should prove unlovely, soulless, cold, Or anything, in truth, but what you are. Gem. And how soon were you reassured in me? Lor. The moment I first saw that sleeping face. Yet, oft and oft, as I walked up and down, The thought you might not love me, so oppressed me, I almost could have snatched you in my arms, And flung you still unconscious to the waves, Rather than wait my fate. Gem. Oh could you doubt it? What strange and dreadful things you say with smiles! And had I died in truth, when all but you Thought me a corpseâdied ere my life began, Known no existence but that twilight world! Like a chill blast as from my funeral vault, Comes the remembrance back to me e'en now, That I was happyâoh, but tell me, will you Love me as Harold did? Lor. Far more, believe me, And with a love less selfish. You shall be The centre here of an adoring worldâ Knights, poets, artists shall be privileged To circle round my star, and carry back Its image to the tented battle-field, Or dream it into poetry and painting. But tell me, in my turn, will you love me As you loved Harold? Gem. Oh, a thousand times more! Lor. But still you loved him? Gem. As a child its guardian, Or, as an elder brother. For the rest, So far away, so long ago seems now The life that was, I but remember it As a tale told to me, and scarce believe That Gemma was myself. Lor. Forget her then, And say once more, you love me most. Gem. Oh, yes! I could no more have dreamed such love as this From what I felt for him, than I could guessâ When sometimes he would bring me, for a token, The dried-up effigy of a thing that bloomed In some strange, hazardous spot, some mountain fastness, Or palace garden of his enemiesâ How to restore from thence the living flower, Or from that single flower to realise The multitudinous glow, the mingled perfume Of nature's sumptuous nosegay, which this isle Holds in her happy hands. Lor. Thrice-fortunate he Who opened, ere too late, your dungeon door! Now you are come into the world for which You were created, nor less welcome there Because some dewdrops from a colder clime Still linger, to our fancies, on your beauty. You have the generous ardour of the south, Born in you with those deep Venetian eyes, And the sweet northern sensibility, Taught in a pale and melancholy landâ But only here could you be understood, There your rich sparkling fancies, and fond yearnings Would have found no companionâI can read them As easily as I count this rose's petals! You are to me no mysteryâto be first Worshipped and wondered at, then wearied ofâ Rather the favourite poem which we read A thousand times, and fancy we alone Take all the measure of its geniusâoh, What poem like the heart of her we love! Come, let us pace beneath these trelliced vines! [They wander away together. Scene III. âA Gallery in the Palace, hung with portraits. Zilia and Gemma. Zil. A little longer must I claim your patience, My wild young pupil! I have shown you, here, The grimmest of your far-off ancestors, Nor will I blame you much for gazing on them With but cold admiration. Now I bid you Look closer at this one. What think you of it? Is it too stern for you? To me it seems The proud and perfect image of a princeâ A head imperial with its raven hair, Its glittering eyes, its swarthy, care-worn cheekâ Peerless alike in court and battle-field. How would your rude sea-giant look beside him, With club or battle-axe and streaming locks? How does this portrait strike you? Gem. Oh! I love it, It looks so great and good! Zil. And these two youths, So fiercely beautiful! Look close, my Gemma, And say which pleases you the mostâthis one, With lips of smiling scorn and wild bright eyes, Or that one's sterner fire? Gem. Who, then, are these? Are all these three my kindred? Zil. Even so! This is your father! Did you ne'er remember You had a father? How you tremble! Come! You must have courage to hear moreâthese twain Are your two brothers. Gem. Had I brothers, too? Zil. You would have loved them had they still been livingâ Is it not so? Gem. When did they die? How was it, I wonder, I was never told of them? Zil. They died all in one day, whilst you were still A happy child in Naxos. Noble boys! They loved you dearly. It was Marco first That called you in his joy, when you were born, The gem of Naxosâso the very name You bear this day is a love-gift from him. And Carlo took you in his arms and vow'd To be your knight for ever. Gem. And both dead! Zil. Both dead indeed, my Gemma! The brave pair Fell by their father's side, fighting for himâ Fell where he fell, by the same savage hand. Gem. Alas! by whose? Who was so cruel? Zil. Ah! It was a day of agony in Naxos, When the invader on its gardens burst With steel and flame, and left, when all was over, Such desolation as your eyes, in love With your own lovely isle, would turn away from, With sad abhorrenceâoverhead, unchanged The glare of sun and sky, and on the earth, Ashes, and tumbled stones, and trampled vines, Widows and orphans seeking for the slain, Cries of despair, and all the land aghast For its brave line of princes swept away. Gem. And what became of me? Zil. You were amongst The number of the captives. Now you guess Who was the pirate that destroyed your race? Gem. Oh, tell me! Zil. One you loved. Gem. Whom can you mean? Zil. Whom but your sea-king, Harold? Gem. Never, never! Oh, now I know you are jesting! Zil. 'T is sad earnest. Gem. It could not beâindeed, you are mistaken, You do not know how kind he was, how gentle. Zil. Gentle to you, no doubt! who would not be? And yet this gentle pirate was the scourge Of many a lovely shoreâthe dread and hate Of many a town and village! He it wasâ He and no other, smote your happy home, And stole you from it with his blood stained-hands. What say you to him now? Gem. I am so bewildered! I cannot understand...... Zil. Yet, by this cheek Whose glowing rose is changed to a white flower, Those tresses trembling to your heart's quick throbs, As to the wind, I think you do believe it. Why should you wonder that a savage Dane, Whose breath of life is piracy and slaughter, Should act after his kind? Tell me you hate him! Gem. All through those years I recall nought but kindness...... Oh, if you had but seen him that last morn When I would needs rush forth in the cold storm, To watch from the cliff-edge the riotous sea! How close he wrapped me in his bearskin cloak, And held me safely with his iron arm, That I might lean far down and gaze my fill, And when I broke away from him and laughed, Whilst the wind blew me towards the crumbling brink, And back he snatched me in a haste of horror, And they all laughed, Thorbrand and all of them, Their great, deep, northern laughterâall but heâ How his lip trembled whilst he chided me, Sadly, not angrily! oh, he did love me! And they all loved meâall the northmen loved me! Zil. A pretty tale, my pretty little Gemma! But still, you must not love him. Enter Lorenzo. Zil. Come, Lorenzo! Console your Princess, for these by-gone woes Her heart and eyes have melted so to hear of, And teach her to believe her favourite pirate Was worthier far of hate than tenderness. She thinks because he loved her lovely self He loved too all mankind. [Exit. Lor. You love him still, then? Gem. No, I love you! Lor. And, if you make me rich With such a loveâlove to my heart as sweet As the first perfumed breezes of the land To weary sailorsâgenerous as the streams That pour their all into a thankless sea, But, not like them, unthankedâthen must I be Your faithful guardian from your enemy, And you must never, from this time, forget He is your enemy. Gem. I shall remember Only that I love you. And as for himâ I shall forget to think of him. Poor Harold! He thinks me dead, and he is mourning for me, E'en now, I know it well! but, since the past Is only horror, why should I recall it? Lor. And yet, so strong the spell of an old love, How know I, if he stood before you there, The horror would not vanish like a dream, And you again become in heart the bride He destined you to be. Gem. His bride, Lorenzo! Not brideâhe never meant me for his bride! I was to him a child, a favourite sisterâ You would make me laugh, but that you make me weep. Vex me no more. Lor. I will not, when you 've vowed Never to be his brideânever to be Another's bride but mine. Gem. No, never, never! Scene IV. âNight. A festival in the Palace Gardens. Enter Lioni and Querini. Lio. What think you of this scene? oh, youth like yours, Youth of both knight and poet, should methinks Leap up, on fire to greet the bright wild chance That brought this lovely child to be our queen! What think you of our Gemma's festival? Quer. I think a jubilee more beautiful Made never yet a fairy-dance of night! Those lights in fiery dewdrops sprinkled o'er The mounded gloom of foliageâthe soft noise Of talk and laughter, so mysteriously Crowding the garden-darknessânightingales Bursting with rapture into every silence That falls by fits upon the perfumed hourâ The hidden harpings out of bowery nooksâ And songs made sad by distance, swelling up From yonder happy shore, in all its length One frenzy of Romaikasâ Lio. Nay, look there! A few steps to the right of these tall laurels, And there you see her on that cedar mound, Enthroned in a wide blaze of light, above That ring of bright-robed creatures on the turf. Ay, there 's the graceful consort of the Doge Beside her darling Princessâat her feet The Doge's happy son. Quer. Happy indeed! Oh, it is beautifulâtoo beautiful! And my heart aches before the luminous vision, As at the closed gates of a paradise, Not lost, but never entered. Lio. What sad words Are these I hear you murmuring to yourself?â She rises! Quer. And with all her shining train Sweeps in a stream of light back to the palace. She 's goneâthe festival is closed for me, And yet these idle revellers remain, Unconscious that their star has left the sky. Lio. Come, let us wander to a lower terrace, Whence we can watch the dancers on the shore. 'T will bring me back a hundred joys of youth, Our island's gloom so long had made to me A bitter recollection. Let us listen To this up-floating strain, so sweetly loud. Song from below. Come, the dancers wait thee, maiden! maiden with the eyes of fire! Come, the bounding ring to lead in, where the dancers never tire! Maiden with the wild, sweet smile curling in the lips of red, Come and lead our mad Romaika, as our loveliest oft have led. Up! we wait thee, loitering beauty! up, and deck thyself in haste! Streaming from the cap of scarlet, loose thy tresses to the waist! Part them from thy scornful brows, set their black on fire with flowers! Then, whilst the warm moon allows, come and dance away the hours! If I lead your mad Romaika, not a link your chain must missâ Though I plunge it in the breaker, though I whirl it o'er th' abyss! Yes, we follow! let us go! wild hearts throbbing to begin! But the lyre and flute too slow, curb th' impatient rapture in! Now, a fire from brow to brow kindles with the kindling strings! Faster, faster, faster! now, life begins to mount on wings! Into magic air she darts, and we follow with a bound! Up to heaven it whirls our hearts, and the brain spins round and round! Onward, onward, youth and maiden! How she wildly holds her way, Though our feet in foam are hidden, and the splashing of the spray Into all our glowing faces lightly tosses back our laughterâ Still the flying wave she chases, follow, follow, follow after! Oh, Panagia! from our feet slide the safe supporting sands! Was it death we rushed to meet with these interlacing hands? Cruel, lovely, fatal stranger! fair fiend, luring us to doom! Wild eyes smiling on our danger! down we dance into the tomb! Quer. Hark, hark, what shrieks! that is no sound of mirth! Lio. What strange disaster, what new horror's this? Quer. I 'll to the beach and see. Lio. I 'll not delay you With my too feeble steps. Haste, haste my friend! [Exit Querini. Scene V. âAt the entrance of a suite of splendid apartments in the Palace. Gemma, a Lady of the Bedchamber, and Attendants. Lady. Madam, indeed the hours are wearing on More near to dawn than midnight. Gem. Oh, not yet! I cannot sleep yet. Bid my maidens go, I shall not need them. [Exeunt Attendants. What a magic night! In the still shine and shadow of the moon, Those frescoes stood along the walls like ghosts, Till your lamps broke the spell. Lady. Shall I unfasten At least these jewels? Gem. No, let me still wear The dress I have been so happy in to-night! [She passes into the balcony. Oh, how can any one sleep through such nights, When all the world is glory! But who else Has days like mine to look to? For whom else Does morning bring Lorenzo? Wondrous lot! But one Lorenzo, and Lorenzo mine! [Shrieks and confusion in the gardens below. Lady. Ah, madam, what is that? Gem. Oh! can it be...... Has any evil happened to Lorenzo? Enter hastily Zilia and Ladies. Zil. Where are you, Gemma, Gemma?âAh! what's that? Quer. (from the gallery) The Duchess! Save the Duchess! Close those doors! The Danes are on us! Zil. Close them! close them! Haste! We shall be murdered! Where then are the guards? Gem. Oh, where's Lorenzo? [Armed men are heard rushing into the gallery. The doors are burst open. Enter Harold alone. Har. Gemma!......Is it so, then? Hast thou forgotten me! Gem. Oh, Harold! Har. Gemma! Art thou afraid of me? Gem. Oh, thou art cruel To terrify me so! Har. To terrify thee? Once thou wouldst fly to me, when I came back From shorter absence, and embrace me, Gemma! Gem. Oh, Harold! Harold! Why dost thou come thus So strangely, when I thought thee far away, To startle me half-mad? Har. And didst thou think Never to see me more? Didst thou think that? Oh, when I thought thee dead, almost my heart Broke for thee, Gemma! If I lived or felt I know not, all that miserable time! But now come home once more! for I have sailed So far to seek thee! What, and did I grasp This tender hand too tightly? Gem. Let me go! Oh, Harold, let me go! Har. Why! foolish child? Come, it is time. Gem. I cannot go with thee! In mercy let me go! Har. What has bewitched thee? Hast thou, from these few hours spent in the grave, Risen up with but the ghost of thy past heart? Come, come away, my Gemma! Come, my bride! Gem. Thy brideâthy bride! Why dost thou call me bride? What dost thou want with me? Oh, let me goâ I am no bride for thee! Har. Thou art no bride For any other man! Gem. Lorenzo! save me! Har. Oh, thou art mine, mine only! Never more Shall mortal rob me of my treasure! Come! [He snatches Gemma up; she shrieks and faints; Harold carries her off. Zil. Good heavens! a thunder-stroke! What's left to do? Where is my son? Has he been murdered, then? A Lady. Querini! Oh, he's slain! Quer. (from without) No, no! but wounded! Zil. (rushing to the door) Oh, where in heaven's name is my son, Querini? Quer. Methought I saw him from a distance, rush In frenzy through the gardenâhe had heard The alarm too lateâhe must have reached the shore. Oh, Gemma, Gemma! I would have died for thee! [Swoons. A Lady. Help, ladies, here! let us bind up his wounds. Zil. I dare not stir a step to learn our fate...... Another Lady. Oh, madam, madam! to this window! Come! The pirate-boat is dashing o'er the sea, Rowed by a crew of giants, and behind them A swarm of shoreboats scattered in pursuit! Zil. Thank heaven! Still, where's my son? Lady. I seeâI see him! He that's bare-headed in the foremost boatâ I thinkâI am sure 't is he! Zil. I think so too. Ay, there he hastes to throw away his life! And yet I fear notâhe will be too lateâ What chance have your slight Naxiotes in the race? With every furious oar-stroke how the Danes Widen the hopeless distanceâand look there! Their ship lies waiting in that stream of moonlight! Oh, luckless Gemma, there's no hope for her! Was ever such disaster known on earth? 'Twill drive Lorenzo mad!âCome, ladies, comeâ The palace is all stirringâall alert, Now 'tis too late! What shouting and confusion! [Exeunt Zilia and Ladies. Scene VI. âEarly morning. The town in confusion. Enter Peasant youths and maidens in holiday dress. A Peasant. What means this loud alarm of bells, that reached E'en to our heights above since break of day? Another Peasant. And all this crowd that's hurrying to the beach? Another Peasant. And yon war-galley weighing anchor now, And shaking loose its canvass to this first Faint breeze that ripples the last night's long calm. A Townsman. Alas! alas! alas! Another Townsman. 'Tis for the Duchess! Have not you heard it? Peasants. What of her? We come To lay our humble homage at her footstool, Eager for the least glimpse of her sweet beauty, Eager that she may deign to set her feet Upon these flowers we long to strew before her. A Towns. Then turn again! We have lost our sweet Princess! Peasants. What! is she dead? Oh, woe! Towns. Not dead, but gone! E'en at the very height of our rejoicing, Whilst night was wild with light and ecstacy, The Dane burst on usâfrom her very palace Snatched off our treasure...... Another Towns. Come, no time to lose If you would see the Doge's son embark! To the seashore, haste! A Peasant. Is yonder then his galley? He hastens to the rescue? Towns. Who but he? Oh, had you seen him, from that vain boat-chase Returning, leap on shore! Such silent rage! His face was black as midnightâfew and stern The words he spoke, whilst swiftly to and fro The busy sailors hastened at his bidding. And that long look he fastened on the pirate! Then sharply turned away, and seemed as if He had forgot 'twas there. Another Towns. And such a throng Of volunteers came round for Gemma's sake! All our young nobles frantic to enlist Beneath Lorenzo's flag. E'en brave Querini, Half-slain, they say, last night at Gemma's door, Will not be left behind; as eager, too, That brave Knight of Saint John, from Palestine. [All hasten away. Scene VII. âThe seashore crowded with people. Enter Lorenzo, Querini, and Knight of St. John. Quer. Be of good cheer, you will win! And for the moment Your loss is nobler than the gain of others. To strive for such a prize, revenge such beauty, With such an enemy to strive in arms, Lifts manhood up to its divinest height, Crests it as 'twere with fire from nobler spheres! Oh me! this wound......I thought to share your glory! [Swoons. Knight of St. John. And as for me, heaven and Saint John forgive! With scarce more joy upon Damascus' walls This hand would plant the Cross, than it would rend The flaunting raven from yon Pagan's mast! Lor. Rejoice your own hearts with these brilliant fancies! To set my foot upon mine enemy's neck, To bring my bride back safely to her home, Were joy enough, let who will have the gloryâ And I will perish ere be balked of it! [Exeunt Lorenzo and Knight of St. John, and embark. Scene VIII. âThe Deck of Harold's Galley. Harold, Gemma, Thorbrand, Sigurd, and others. Har. See, this broad banner from thy head will screen The blazing sunshine! Rest in peace beneath itâ In silence if thou wilt! And not one word then, Not one, for thy true friends, my comrades tried, All ready here to die for thee and me? Here's Thorbrand, whom thou knowstâmy other selfâ And Rolf, and Sigurdânay, my faithful dog, Poor Jutun! thou didst love him once, e'en him! Never before did he beseech in vain, With those fond eyes, a kind caress from thee. Thor. The wind is freshening fast. See how yon sail Stands out already from the purple wall Of land behind. Sigurd! the Doge's son Is on our track betimes. Sig. Good speed to him! Harold is readyâso is this right arm! I feel a happy thrill from head to foot, As though mine axe were thundering its warm greeting Down on those raven curls that won the heart Of giddy little Gemma. Thor. Come, you must not Dream of forestalling Harold's darling vengeance, His heart would break if any man but he Should touch a hair upon Lorenzo's head. Harold! Sig. He does not hear, not he! His eyes See only Gemma, and hers only see The land we leave behind us. Oh, rare sport Was ours, last night, upon that very shore, To see those gaudy dancers break their chain, And dart away to right and left with shrieks, Like screaming sea-fowl startled from their nests! Thor. And, rarer still, when like mad bulls we burst On Gemma's gilded soldiers, at their dice, And trampled their gay trappings in the dust! Sig. And then the great rush up to Gemma's doors! When they crashed open to our Harold's axe, I stood so near behind him I could see From end to end through all those lighted rooms, Crowded with frightened women dressed like queens! And oh, poor Gemma...... Thor. How she stood transfixed, Between those pillarsâI can see her now! Just as she stepped in from the balcony, Half ghost-like in that robe of silvery blue Some witch has wove for herâwith her wide eyes, All one astonished flash like a mad skald's, Fastened on Harold's face. Sig. Poor, foolish child! I am glad we have her back. I noted too That other splendid one, with gold-bound forehead, And spreading robes, so snow-pale, proud and tremblingâ I thought she almost smiled with her white lips, As she leaned back upon her couch and stared Before her straight at Harold...... Thor. You forget not That other day when we, young wolves of war, Ran wild o'er that same palaceâup the stairs At Harold's heels came thund'ringâyears ago! Sig. Do I so? Little, weeping, tiny Gemma That day had soon been trampled out of life, Unseen, unheeded, but for Harold's care. And I remember how I laughed to see The baby in his arms! Thor. Look at her now! She does not seem too happy to be with us! How on her hands she droops her little head, And takes no heed of Harold! Har. (to Gemma) Is it so then? I was a fool, and thou didst never love me! When I came back to thee time after time, Out of the salt sea-winds, hungry for land, To see thee spring up from thy blazing hearth, Where round thee in a circle spun thy maids, And down the long red twilight of my hallâ Timing sweet laughter with thy clapping handsâ Flutter just like a fire-fly from the southâ Thou didst not love me! When, thy greeting over, Thou wouldst bound from me with a tender cry, To shower thy wild caresses on my hound, Thou didst not love me! When thy little hand Would draw me to the fire that I might sit And tell thee my adventures, thou the while Listening with eyes that never swerved from mine, Thou didst not love me! When my stalwart Danes Would fling my heavy spoils upon the floor, And thou wouldst kneel to gaze and wonder at them, And ask me all their histories and their names, Thou didst not love me! When, at fall of night, Thou wouldst beguile me to some barr'd loophole That showed a pale moon on a pale gray sea, And with uplifted finger bid me listen To sounds once dear to thee, the mermaids' songâ Oh, never didst thou love me! Gem. Yes, indeed, I loved thee then. Har. Then! and oh, why not now? Gem. Oh, love some warrior-princess of the northâ I am not fit for thee! Har. And what care I If thou be fit or unfit? I love thee! Gem. Is it true, Haroldâtrue what they have told me? Har. What have they told thee? Gem. No, I dare not ask! I know it is not true. It was not thouâ It could not beâdidst lay mine island waste, And slay my father and my brothersâoh! Tell me it is not true. Har. It is true, Gemma! Now be content, thou hast stabbed me to the soul, And taken vengeance on me for thy slain. Yes, thou art right to hate me. Gem. When I saw Those three dear portraits, when they told me all... It was not hate, but horror and amazeâ Har. Witness the ghosts of all who fell that day, I have repented every day since then! For thy sake I repented, oh, my darling! Whom, ere I saw and loved, I made an orphan. Ah, but thou didst not shudder at me then! I found thee in a room with painted walls, Lost and bewildered in its spaciousness, A little, trembling, weeping, fairy queen, With all thy tiny tressesâof a gold Less auburn than are theseâtumbling confused About thy splendid raiment, thy small hands Smiting each other in thy passion of terror. Then in mine arms I lifted thee, poor child! And quickly bore thee from the noise and tumult Gathering around in gallery and hall, To a safe shelter. I was but a youth, Reared up on roaring seas and battle-fieldsâ 'T was the first time that I had led my fleetâ Who never had till then so much as stooped To pluck a flower. Never, before or since, Have I loved any living thing like thee! I cannot let thee go. Gem. You will, you will! My once kind Harold, pity your poor Gemma! You know not misery, you who have the world, Sea after sea, and continent and isle, Danger and glory, sunshine and the shade, The storm and calm, creation's whole expanse To breathe in! oh, and would you then doom me To gasp for air in prison, where my heart Must beat with death-throes, missing every morn Life's fresh surprise of rapture, where mine eyes Would want all that they loved, hate all they saw, Would see him only, and yet never see him! Oh, that would be a winter of despair I'd not condemn an enemy to freeze in! Well, take me! but I need not kill myself, For I shall die as easily as a flower For lack of sun or rain. Har. Silence, oh, silence! Do you know what you have said, what you have done? Turn to the land once moreâsee you that sail? There comes your loverâand look, here's the sword I thank and kiss for promising revenge. Gem. Harold, what do you mean? No, no, you dare not! Why do you speak so? No, you dare not kill him! You dare not break the heart of a poor girl Who has no other happiness on earth! Oh, speak to me! you know not what it is, Harold, to love as I do. Har. So you think. Gem. Tell me you will not kill him! say so, Harold! Oh, can you be so changed! Never before Have you denied me anything I asked! Har. Is it come to this? What then, these hands are tied! What then, must I deny this mangled heart, Thirsting amidst its writhings for revenge, As fiercely as the she wolfâin her wounds, Dying above her cubsâfor waterâchoke Its bitter cry, and let him live, who stole My life's delight, my very life away, To wear it triumphing, whilst I go back Bereaved and baffled!âWell, so be it, Gemma! For thy sake will I fling away revenge, Where all my other hopes are gone already, To the winds and waves. And when we two shall meet, My very sword will wonder at the hand That wields it! Gem. Oh, I thank thee, thank thee, Harold! Har. Hush, Gemma! Gem. Oh, alas! alas! dear Harold! I meant not so to wound thee. Har. Well, I go then, Without a hope on earthâI who had grasped Mine enemy in fancy with one hand, My darling with the other, to crush him, And bear her home in triumph to mine eyrie! I go hence as I came, as empty-handed, But more unfortunate! Oh, to look back, Instead of looking forward! never more To wish for anything on earth! Weep notâ Those tears console me not, they madden me! Now pass below, I pray thee, and fear nothing, Whatever tumult thou may'st hear above. Lorenzo 's safe, and each man here thy friend. [Gemma goes below. Now, hearken! not a man of you must touch The Doge's son but me. Thor. Harold, 't is just! Be thine the joy and glory of revenge. [They prepare for action. Scene IX. âThe ships of Harold and Lorenzo along-side of each other. Lorenzo, Knight of St. John, and Venetians rush on board Harold's ship. Lor. Where art thou, robber? strike him none but I! Sig. So will I dye thy white cross red. [Strikes the Knight of St. John. Knight. Avenge me, Lorenzo! [Falls. Lor. It is done. [Runs Sigurd through with his sword. Now, thou bride stealer, It is thy turn! Thor. And thine! Har. Thorbrand, stand back! (To Lorenzo Madman, to challenge thus the blood of Odin! [They fight. Harold shatters Lorenzo's sword, overpowers and makes him prisoner. The Venetians give way, and after a struggle, surrender. Har. First, clear away the corpses! Thorbrand, go, See that the signs of slaughter on the deck Of the Venetian galley be effaced, As here on this. Thor. Why did you spare your foe? For now you will not slay him in cold blood. I understand you not. Har. You will soon, Thorbrand. [He passes below and reappears with Gemma. Lor. Magnanimous Pirate, thou hast spared her life then! Har. Behold your lover, Gemma! (to Lorenzo) You are freeâ I give you back your galley and your bride. Return with them to Naxos. Gem. Oh, Lorenzo! 'T is too much joy! I thought thee lost for ever. Thou art not wounded? Lor. Only in my soul, To think I owe thee to that Pirate's mercy. What, wilt thou linger here? Gem. Oh, let me thank thee, Harold, this once! I must! Har. What didst thou say? I did not hear thee. Now farewell for ever! Be happy, Gemma, and forget the home In which thou wert not happy. [Turns away. Gem. Harold, Harold! [Lorenzo hurries her away. Thor. She loves her false Venetian! Can it be? Oh, Harold, if you love me, let me send An arrow through his heart! Har. Be silent, Thorbrand. [Lorenzo's ship separates from Harold's. Scene X. âLorenzo's ship. Lorenzo, Gemma, and Sailors. Gem. He would not hear my last words. Ah, Lorenzo! E'en when we love and are loved, we can suffer! There 's a remorse I cannot rid my heart ofâ And yet, how could I help it? How you look! Can you still see him, that you lean so far O'er the ship's side? Is he still there on deck? Lor. There goes a man whom I shall kill one day. Gem. What did you say? tell me, for well I know By that quick undertone, and gasping breath, Although you smile, that you are fiercely angry. Lor. The wind is changing to the west. Soon, Gemma, We shall reach landâin triumph they will think. Gem. Now own that he is generous, my Lorenzo! Is he not noble? Lor. What would I not own, When you look up to me with those large eyes, And hold my hand with such a pleading clasp? He shall be all you choose. Gem. Now do not jest, But say you pity him. Lor. Not pityâno, But envy him. Gem. For what? Lor. Those tender tears.â The Dane lies-to as though regretfully, And loath to lose sight of his prize forgone. Let him regret! he never shall again Surprise our carelessness. Gem. You know we owe him, You, life, and I, my all of happiness. Why do those dark brows meet so angrily? Lor. Because I rather would have lost that life, Than owed it to his mercy and your prayers. Do you know I wonder that this mighty Dane, Repenting of his clemency sublime, Turns not again upon his parting steps To snatch you back. He should not find it easy! Ere I would yield you now...... Gem. How you mistake him! Never, Lorenzo, has he broke his word. Lor. These northern virtues! oh, how well by heart You know them all.âAre you prepared to be The heroine of a rapturous return? When first I brought you to these shores, 't was nightâ Gemma, 't was on this very deck you slept! Gem. This very deck, oh heaven! and yet, to think Mine eyes remember nothing of all this! Sit down and tell me once more of your voyage. Lor. And never, never, has your secret heart Whispered a wish that voyage had not been? Gem. Unkind Lorenzo! but you shall not vex meâ I know you are jesting, for you know I love you. Scene XI. âOn board Harold's ship. Harold, Thorbrand, and other Northmen. Thor. It was a noble victory! But you lookâ Oh, how unlike yourself! You have no wound You have not told us of? Har. No, Thorbrand. Thor. Then You mourn for Sigurd! Do not mourn for him, For Sigurd died as Northmen love to dieâ The deck beneath him, the blue sky above him, And the slain corpses of his enemy round him. Har. Sigurd was brave, and true, and dear to me, And brave, and true, and dear, were all who fellâ And yet I am not mourning for them. Thor. Then A Dwerga has bewitched you. For you spoke, Moved, fought, as in a dreamâfrom right to left You dealt destruction like a passionless fate, Resistless, but incapable of rage. Victorious, next you spurned your victory, And flung success and vengeance to the winds! But yesterday your soul all love and hate, To-day you yield your bride and spare your foe! What has come over you? Har. Oh, Thorbrand, hearken! For the last time we've battled side by side! As surely as my flag to-day has triumphed, As surely as the haughty flag of Venice Has dropped before me like a frost-cut leaf, As surely as my race was born from Odin, Ne'er shall I lead you more, ye northern ravens, To grapple, beak and claw, by land or sea, With rolling ship, or rock-built castle. Thor. Harold! Har. No more my heart shall beat a march to battle, Nor shall my soul ever drink rapture more At the great feast of swords, whence it was wont To rise intoxicate. My course is run, Thou, Thorbrand, take my earldom and my fleet, Be what I wasâin me my race expires. Thor. Harold! now say, what mean you? Har. To your hands I give my leadership. My old companions! I am no more your chieftainâfollow Thorbrand, As you have followed me! Thor. Oh see, they weep! How can you bear to leave us? Well I knew, When you resigned the darling of your heart To him whom most you hate, some spell had seized you! Har. Hush! if you love me, if you dread my curse, Swear to me, one and all, with lifted hands, Ne'er to pluck fruit or blossom from one tree, Fire but a blade of grass, or shed the blood Of so much as a wild-dove's nestling brood, In one of Gemma's isles. All. We swear it, Harold! Thor. Ill-fated day!âBut whither will you go? How will you live henceforth? Har. Henceforth, methinks, I shall be likest to that desolate cape Which stands and gazes as it stood and gazed, Since earth began, a never-wearied watcher, Cold and incurious o'er an unknown sea. E'en so my future is an Arctic waste, With frozen winter for a pioneer! I know a spot in Iceland, where no echo Could reach me, from the past, where boiling springs Tell to grave rocks and melancholy sward, The story of a pain-wrung passionate heart. There could I lay my weary armour down, And dream away my life. Thor. And this the end! Oh, we have shared such glorious hours together, By land and sea, in war, in wilds unknown, Drunk with the passion and the pride of danger! How have we clung to dizzy precipices, As 't were suspended over the whole world, And gazed unfaltering on its map below, Or, coffined in a glacier, on our way To storm the she-bear's den, have scarcely hewn A door with-strenuous axe-strokes back to lifeâ Or, grappling with the monster's dire embrace, Swooned from the gory duel to awakeâ Have we not each in turn such wakings known?â Beneath the cold innumerable stars, Beside her carcase, stiffening in the snow! How many times across how many seas, Have felt death's cup cold at our very lipsâ In the dark night, on unknown waters, heard The noise of unseen breakers on our bowâ Been balanced on the whirlpool's roaring brink, Or on frail rafts adrift 'neath skies of fire, In waking trance have heard the gush of streamsâ Have followed visions of more beauteous peril, Where the far-shining rivers guided us Through greenly shadowing trees, fast anchored on Wide golden seas of meadowâwoodland swells Melting away to the blue skies of Juneâ Where shrieking peasants fled before our face, And warriors came to meet us, where we held Our revels in the palaces of princes, And, laden with their spoils, came conquerors home! Oh, what to thee was Gemma in those hours? What is a girl's love to such joys as these? Chance made her dear to thee, and chance may make Another dearer! Har. There 's no throw of the dice Can bring that chance to me. Thor. Still, still I say You are bewitched. Oh, for a counter-charm To call your true self from the Dwerga's halls, And chase away the spectral counterfeit! You, in the noblest moment of your years, You, the most minstrel-honoured of your race, Fling by a future clanging with your deeds, To dream a hermit's dream and be forgotten! Oh, may I never love, if love did this! Har. I am made so, Thorbrand. Thor. But you are so made You cannot stay in your self-chosen tomb. Like that dead pair of heroes sepulchred Deep in the rock, who for a thousand years Kept up a ghostly warfare in the darkâ All the vast hollow echoing with the thunderâ Your thoughts will fight together in that gloom Your soul is buried in, till faint and torn, Lashed by the horror of a new despair, You headlong rush into the world again. You know not yet your future. Har. Since this morning, I know it, Thorbrand. Nothing that can happen Can change it now. Thor. Alas! I say no moreâ At least remain our leader till we leave These seasâha, Harold! Har. Ay, the storm at last!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. âA spacious balcony of the Palace overlooking the sea. Zilia, Lorenzo, and others assembled watching the storm. Zil. How well that like a child she sleeps away Th' emotions that have shaken so her frame! This sight would have renewed them. A fair ship, Now we can see her close. Lor. You will soon see her Still closer. Zil. She has not a chance you think? Those roaring waves play with her as a toy That the next touch will shatter. Lor. Rather call her A bird that 's spell-bound by a serpent's eye, Dreading, yet ever drawn towards its fateâ So does that galley strive and strive again, And yet again rush headlong towards the shore. I feel as if I were that serpent, mother. One of the lookers-on. Just retribution that has made this shore The doom of Harold. How those ghastly breakers Gnash their white teeth at him! Another. Yet, now to perishâ In the clear light of dayâwere scarce more fearful Than to fall slain in battle. To behold For the last time the faces of our fellows, Exchange the last of human sympathyâ Gives the soul strength for a sublime regret, And crowds more life into life's final moment, Than throbbed in all before. But night draws nearâ And death in darkness and in uproarâoh! The soul must shrink as from the brink of chaos, And madden with the horror, ere it plunge Into the gulf of fate. Another. And this the end! On a lea-shore, with tattered sails, to reelâ Like a spent quarry pierced by many a shaft, Till caught and mangled by triumphant houndsâ That once went flaunting under all her canvass, To robbery and murder. Lor. (to Zilia) I must begone. Zil. One momentâshould he yet ride out the storm? Lor. He will notâshe is half a wreck already. Zil. But should he 'scape the ship and reach the land? Lor. I go to make provision for that chance. Zil. And how dispose of him? Lor. There 's but one way. Men show no mercy to the famished wolf That creeps in winter howling to their doors. Zil. Ah, well!......strong courses mostly are the wisest! Long as he lives, we cannot feel her safeâ But yet I fear 't will be a grief to her! It will be hard to make her see the justice...... Lor. She need not know itâfor a time at least. Zil. Her thoughts will be engrossed by that event That 's greatest in the world to girlhood's eyes. The white mist of the wedding veil will hide All from her eyes but love. Lor. You say she still Is sleeping? Zil. Happily, she is. Lor. I leave you then. By night you shall hear of me. Scene II. âEvening. The seashore. A crowd assembled. Lorenzo and a fisherman. Fisher. They must have perishedâevery soul on board, Except this one I told you of. Lor. And heâ What sort of man? A sailor, a mere sailor? Fisher. No, no, my lord! I know not what to call himâ In size and strength a giant, such as ne'er Was born in all the islands of old Greece, Or any land I 've heard of. How he swam! To watch him as he came, with head thrown back, Still yellow, like a sun, though drenched in brine, Now swallowed up, now bursting through again, You would have thought it was a ship-wrecked lion Struggling against the billows. Such a feat, I think, has not been seen since earth began! Lor. You said you left him sleeping? Fisher. Or at least, Motionless as the huge rough-hewn Apollo, In yonder northern quarries. And to own The simple truth, we care not to come near him. So there he lies, his garments dropping brine, And his head resting on a heap of weed. Perchance he is dead. Lor. Well, guide us to the spot. [Exeunt Lorenzo and Fisherman with armed followers. Scene III. âA retired spot in another part of the seashore. Enter Lorenzo, Fisherman, &amp;c. Harold stretched upon the ground against a rock. Fisher. This way, my lord! There! with the moon full on him! He has half raised himself I seeâhis head Rests on his hand. Lor. It is himself indeed. I know him, though his face is turned away. Wait! I 'll move softly on. Har. My love, my darling! Fisher. He sees us not! Har. They died who wished to live, But I was wrecked already. Lor. Dane, thy fate! [Stabs him. Har. (starting to his feet, then falling again) Well done, assassin! fisherman, come hither! Lor. Go to him. Fisher. My lord, I dare not. Har. I am dying, And could not hurt thee if I would. Come nearerâ Seest thou this ring? Go, throw it in the water. You have done well. [Dies. Fisher. He is dead, my lord. Lor. We two Could not exist together in one world. Vengeance is overânext the marriage morn. [Exit Lorenzo and followers. Enter Fisherman's wife. Wife. Oh, husband, what is this? what, the Dane killed? Alas, this is a woeful evening's work! Fisher. Panagia! how he started to his feetâ I thought that moment we were all dead men!â When the sharp steel went through him, and ere twice My heart could bound, fell down again like a tower!â What witchcraft was there in that ring I wonder! It would have made my fortune. For such pearls, I think our Duchess would have given her soul. Wife. Ah me, but I shall dream of that pale giant And feel all night his great blue eyes upon me! Perhaps e'en he, for as terrible as he is, Has wife or sister left at home to mourn him. They might have spared him when the waves had mercy! I feared him then, but now I pity him, And dread his death may bring a curse upon us. A Voice from the sea. Harold! Harold! Harold! Wife. Hark! Hark! oh heaven! A drowning woman's cry! Husband, 't is terrible! can naught be done? Canst thou not save her? Fisher. Look! Enter Astrid from the sea. Wife. A ghost! a ghost! Fisher. Hush, let us see what happens. Wife. Oh, great heavens! This is too dreadful! why then was he murdered, To bring this on us? Fisher. This is the ring's doingâ I would I had not thrown it. Wife. Can ghosts sob so, And wring such piteous hands, and shed such tears? Ast. My brother! oh, my brother! oh, my brother! Wife. Do you see that crown of coral on her head? And oh, what ringlets, like a golden veil! Fisher. Look there! look there! more of them! Oh, the sea Is all ashine with these white, gold-haired creatures! On every wave there 's one. Wife. Oh, come away, Come away, husband! I can bear no more! This bodes no good to Naxos, nor the Duchess. Scene IV. âNight. Gemma asleep in her chamber. Mermaids singing in the sea below. Mer. Cruel, cruel beauty! sweetly sleeping Whilst we bear away thy murdered lover! Mermaid sisters wringing hands and weeping! Gemma sleeps, her wedding crown above her! Hark, oh, hark! a trembling in the dark! 'T is the chime, wild with triumphant crime, Far and wide that rings to wake the bride, Cursed already to the end of time. Bear him hence, ere every isle and rock In the cruel clamour takes a part, And the din as in a dream shall knock On the doors of his deep-sleeping heart. Faithful sorrow weeps the livelong night, Treacherous joy arises with the sun! Woe to bride and bridegroom whose delight Dances on the grave of love undone! Weep for her who loved him, weep for her In her pale green glistening halls below Doomed to sit, and desolately hear All the happy ships sweep to and fro, Hear his name to brave old northern rhyme Wildly chanted, in an oft-told taleâ She, the while, a ghost of by-gone time, Cares no more to watch the passing sailâ Never more her coralled head shall raise, Whilst her maids with backward streaming hair, Lips that pant with haste, and glowing face, In their joy drop down to tell her he is there. Northern Iceberg! with thy spires of pride, Sweeping ruin o'er a wintry seaâ Wherefore didst thou trust the melting tide? Soft and treacherous summer vanquished thee! Let us go! Sea-sisters, let us go! Loud, and loud, and louder, bell on bell! Woe, oh, woe! for ever, ever woe! Faster! faster! Fatal bride, farewell! Naxiotes singing beneath the window. Nax. Up, beautiful bride! Earth's night-dream is over! Thine angel smiles byâ He waits to confide Thy life to thy loverâ Then back to the sky. True love at thy feet His purple hath spread, The altar is dressedâ And Hope comes to meet With star-circled head Her snowy-veiled guest. Yet pause where thou art, Ere the rapturous spring To the last golden height! Ecstatic young heart, Oh, pause on the wing Of thy dizzy delight! Behind a closed door When footsteps draw near, With tidings of blissâ One heart-bound, no moreâ One rapture like fearâ Such a moment is this! When joy becomes real, That flash of sensationâ That moment's perfumeâ Hope's wondrous ideal, And rich expectation, Thou canst not resume. The heart-beat when first The minstrel-hand runs O'er preluding chords, Is lost in the burst Which dazzles at once With music and words. Awake, and arise! In thy splendour and pride, To the altar away!â From earth to the skies, Ring joy to the bride Who is wedded to-day! Enter Zilia, Mistress of the Robes, and Attendants. Zil. Wake, Gemma! Wake, my Princess! Lo, they bring Your wedding-robeâarise! Gem. Oh, where am I? Do you hear them singing! When the angels open The gates of Paradise to happy souls, Such sounds as these, I think, must crowd the air. How glorious life is! Does the world shine thus On every wedding morn? Zil. Brides have charmed eyesâ Though haply not all brides wear in their crown Such flowers of beauty, youth, and love as you do, Whose life is but a poem, set to music. For us, time moves in prose. On days like these, O'er the dead level of a woman's life Rises one royal moment like a sunâ One that I trust will never set for you, Leaving all gray behind it. Gem. Stay! How strange! What I have just remembered was no dream! I heard, as I do liveâlast night I heard, When darkness was just freshening into twilight, Voices that sang in Danish from the shore. How could it be? And strangest still of all, It was a dirge, a beautiful slow dirgeâ Of many voices harp-like and confused, Yet tuned to one rich harmony of sorrow. My sense was wrapped in a thin veil of sleep, Which never stirred, and yet I heard it allâ Gemma sleeps, her wedding crown above her! Those very words are ringing in my ear, And yet it was a dirge. Zil. 'T was but a dream. There is no creature sings or speaks that tongue In one of all your isles. But do not tell Lorenzo that your dreams heard Danish songs. A Lady (aside to the Mistress of the Robes). To dream of dirges on a wedding-morn! What sort of omen do you call that? M. of the Robes. Hush! No evil omen to so rich a cheek, And to such fresh young eyes. Another Lady. What, if ill news Await us of my lord Lorenzo? M. of the Robes. Nay! What foolish fancies! All is well and shall be! Madam, the time advances. Zil. See, the room Is all ablaze with gold and purple gifts Already, from the north, south, east, and west! Now let my son's belov'd and peerless bride Put on her splendour. M. of the Robes. Sure th' imperial spouse Of PalÃ¦ologus, upon her throne, Ne'er looked more sumptuous! Zil. Lo, the cestus stiff With broidered silver, waits to bind in folds This fabric, glowing from a Persian loom; And pearls, like showers of dewdrops, for your hairâ (The divers stole them from your mermaid-sisters); And last, this flashing crown of argent, mixed With living bloom from the bride's myrtle bough! See, all is ready here. Gem. Dearest princess, Will they be long arraying me? my heart So flutters! Zil. 'T is for your Lorenzo's eyes! [The Mistress of the Robes and Attendants array Gemma for the wedding. Scene V. âThe Piazza before the Cathedral doors. A crowd waiting for the wedding procession. Nax. (singing) Lo, the gay courtiers flashing in and out, Like the uncertain lightnings of the sun, Ere, scattering the vicissitudes of doubt, The broad, clear blaze of summer has begun! And hark, the trumpet's fitful burst of speech, Dropped as in haste, and then snatched up again, With an impatient joy and pain in each, As if a light just seen had vanished in disdain!â Now, now the music in its passionate pride Breaks into frenzy to announce the bride! Through the gay tumult of colours, a light, A glory shines forwardâ't is she! it is she! Sweet wonder! she dawnsâoh, the painful delight!â On eyes that are well nigh too dazzled to see. How the white light of her veil streaming loose Over that splendour of purple array, Is stained with the blush of her beauty, the hues Without lines, like a cloud in the dawn of the day! Enter Gemma, Lorenzo, Zilia, and wedding procession. Gemma alights from her litter, and they prepare to enter the Cathedral. Enter Thorbrand and approaches Gemma. Lor. Stand back, barbarian! Guards, surround and seize him! Thor. Fools! think you, you can hold me? Unarmed, worn With shipwreck and with hunger, I am free That moment I shall choose. Lor. A bridegroom's hand Should not shed blood upon his wedding-morn, Or I might teach thee better. Crossbow-men, See he escape not. Gem. It is Thorbrand! Oh! Lorenzo, let him speak! They must not hurt himâ He is my friend. Oh, let him speak to me! I would be kind to all the world to-day. Zil. This must not be...... Lor. Nay, let her have her will then! Gem. Thou art ghastly, Thorbrand! What has befallen thee? Thor. I have a thing to say to thee. Gem. Say on! Thor. First, I am bound by oath to one I honoured, Never to draw a sword upon these isles, So that I cannot with mine own right hand Take vengeance for the wrong that has been done me. Gem. What wrongâwhat wrong, oh, Thorbrand? Thor. Gemma, know The sacred laws of hospitality Last night were impiously profaned in Naxos, So that the dreadful fame of it will ring, Like funeral bells, amongst these isles for ever. And if thou wert consenting to the deed, Be thou the curse of nations to all timeâ If not, do justice on the murderer. Lor. Ruffian, stand off! Gem. No, let meâlet me hear! Tell me what deed, tell me what murderer! Thor. Harold, the earl, was shipwrecked yesternight, On thine own shores, and on these shores that night Thy bridegroom murdered him! Gem. What means all this? What does he mean, Lorenzo? Lor. Seize the Dane! [Thorbrand breaks loose from the guards. Pursue him! Crossbow-men, let fly! Now, on! On to the wedding! We will speak of this Hereafter, Gemma. Zil. Why, my Princess, heed, At such a moment, yon barbarian's ravings? Saw you not 't was a madman? Gem. Only tell meâ What did he mean, Lorenzo? Lor. Nay, you heard! Since you will know the truth, it must be told! You have done ill to give ear to this pirateâ For your own sake, I would have hindered you. Harold indeed is dead. Trust me, the deed Was just and necessary! For the rest...... Gem. You have broke my heart! [Faints. Zil. Give her to me! Nay, fear not, This will be nothing. Lor. Back to the palace! Mother, No wedding for to day, thanks to that ruffian! [Exeunt. Scene VI. âThe Palace. Gemma on a couch in her chamber, Zilia and Lorenzo watching her. Attendants in the background. Lor. My love, know'st thou me yet? hast thou forgiven? Do not turn from me! Gem. Oh, my misery! Unhappy Harold! murdered for my sake! Oh, Harold! Harold! Lor. Thou hast me to love thee! Am I no more enough for thee? sweet Gemma, Are we not still the same? Gem. How couldst thouâoh, Barbarous Lorenzo! how hadst thou the heart? Lor. Call me not barbarous, Gemma, for I love thee! I love thee more a thousand times than he did! Gem. So true, so generous! and I stabbed him so, By my unkindness! Lor. Am I nothing to thee, My bride, my Gemma? Gem. Cruel, all of youâ Why did you bring me here to make me wretched? I care not to reign o'er you! Take away This odious wedding-crown! Go, go, Lorenzo! From this time forth I hate thee! Zil. Stay, she is raving! She knows not what she says. Lor. You are mistaken. [Exit. Gem. Not one of you can comfort me, not one! No bodiless soul by death just cast adrift On the wide desert of eternity, Was ever yet more desolate than I. Oh, Astrid! Astrid! come to me! Zil. You see Her mind still wanders. Hark! who 's this that sings And plays the harp upon the beach to-night? Go, say the Duchess must not be disturbed. A Lady. 'T is very sweetâperhaps the sound may soothe her. See how she sits up with wide listening eyes! Gem. Oh, leave me! for the love of heaven, all leave me! I am calm againâbut let me be alone, It is the one thing that can do me good. Zil. Shall I not send my son to you? will you not See him again, and pardon and console him, Will you not see him, Gemma? Gem. No, no, no! Leave me! I shall go mad! Zil. (to attendants) Let us leave her, then. Perchance it will be best for her, our presence Just now but serves to irritate her frenzy. Let us have patience, she will soon amend. [Exeunt Zilia and attendants. Mermaids heard singing below. Mer. Come, a tempest of thy years From a height has cast thee down! Come to us with all thy tears, And without thy bridal crown! Come, the world is not for thee! All its love is cold as scorn, And its pity cannot see That it leaves thee more forlorn. Come, oh love in misery, Like a child to be caressed! Come, poor heart, to live or die, As its brokenness finds best. Come, where the sweet moon has told All her pity to the sea! On her floating floor of gold, Lo, we wait and weep for thee! [Gemma rises and leaves her chamber. Scene VII. âA gallery of the Palace. Lorenzo standing at the window. Enter Zilia. Zil. You must take patienceâthis will pass away. She is already calmer. Wonder not A dear friend's death, pirate although he were, Should rudely shock so delicate a frame. When this is over, she will cling to you With the old tenderness. Oh, trust me, once The wedding overâand that soon will beâ She will be brought to see this tragedy In its true light, and all will be forgiven. Oh, yes, I think all will be well to-morrow! 'T is not so long to waitâalthough I long To hear the blessing said above you twain. Lor. I do not hope, my mother, nor desire itâ Her heart is with the Dane, and mine is free. I cannot, never could, love a false mistress. Zil. Why, what is this? What mean you? False you call her? She false to youâto you whom we all see She worships as girls worship their first love? Put by that fancy. Lor. Her own words you heardâ But have not understood them as I did. I need no repetition. Zil. Nay, but think! It was excusable that she should hear With grief the fate of one she had known so longâ Loved even. In your place I think I should not Be jealous of those tears. Lor. Not jealous, motherâ When I have ceased to love I am not jealous. Zil. I know you better than you know yourself, Nor will believe that you have ceased to love. All will be right when once you two have met, Restored to reason by a night's repentance. Lor. 'T is strange what slight details our minds run over, When we demand a reason of the passion That once enslaved us, and how small a blemish Decides our freedom...... Zil. Nay, what idle talk! Was ever such an obstinate pair of lovers! 'T will be a harder task than I had fancied To reunite those ties a moment broke. And all at first so smooth! Lor. Shall I confess it? Bewitching, beautiful as Gemma is, The poet in me sees for its ideal, A something it has never seen in her. Zil. Fastidious lover! what would you have more? Was there perchance a ringlet out of curl When last you saw her? What is her defect? Lor. The type is perfectâleave her as she is, A finished picture from the artist's hands, To draw admiring crowds. Yet have I seen, Another in the gallery of my dreams, Unconsciously perhaps, and yet 't was thereâ I scarce know if the original exists, Or if I hope to find it. There I see A loftier stature both of mind and form, The radiant paleness of a steadfast soul, A face whose still and delicate nobleness Marks out a queen by nature, sweet, but slow To give herself away. Gemma's impassionedâ So should be this enchantress, but not wildly, And rarely sparkling into flame, nor must she Too heedlessly despise the world's proud purple; Let her have queenly worn its utmost glory, Subdued the proud, the proudest, even me, Then let her, if need be, step off her throne In graceful abdication, for my sakeâ If I should ever meet her, at her feet I should not dare to smile. The time has been, And may be yet again, with graver worship, Worship of faltering voice, and humbled eyes, My soul has owned a true divinity. Zil. So you go on refining! I could think, To hear you thus, you were incapable Of heartily desiring anything, Only I can perceive through all this talk About your soul's idealâand what man Has loved that, ever?âthat the heart within you Aches as it never ached before. Lor. Too much, In a past life of passion, have I suffered, Not to know how to deal with such heart achings. Man in his search for happiness so often Stumbles on these wrong paths! I shall go back And try another. Zil. Ah, how proud you are! And yet it sounds to me like child's play. Pride, I think, was never yet so much misplaced, As towards one who has herself so little. Is it such trouble to give utterance Just to the few kind words that make all straight? These children are so easily consoled By those they love, and you besides do love herâ It was an actual love match. Lor. Mother, enough! Either my heart will turn to stone like others, Or I shall find another heart to love me. Therefore, farewell! this very night I mean To embark for Syria. Zil. Nay, you are not serious? Lor. Never have I been more so. Zil. No, no, no! I will not hear this. You are not resolved To fling away the best chance of your life? Lor. I have flung other such away ere now. Zil. And the strange scandal, and the world's great wonder, The triumph of the enviousâyou have strength To brave all that? Lor. I shall be far awayâ And I can win fresh prizes if I need them. Zil. You will not win another such as thisâ Heiress, princess, and beauty, all in one. And then perhaps to know, when 't is too late, She broke her heart for you! Lor. She will not break it, Or not for me. She will forget me, mother, If she has not forgotten me already. Zil. You know not how she loved you! I have smiled So many times o'er her devoted passion! Never read man so coldly o'er his own sentence, As you read yours! Think once again, my son, For your own sake! Ah, well, I see 'tis vain. I think you never will find happiness, You've not the generous courage to lay hold of it, Though you will miss it always while you live. And when you hear, as hear perhaps you will, Your bride is wedded to another bridegroom? You smileâbut there was something ere you smiled, Answered more truly from those two dark brows. You will be wretchedâyou are wretched now! Lor. Farewell, my mother! Zil. My mistaken son! I shall have little to detain me here, Now all my hopes in Gemma are o'erthrown!â The King of Cyprus has a lovely daughterâ Beauty and royalty you yet may win, If not a rich dominion. Well, adieu! [Exit Lorenzo. SCENE VIII. âEvening. A retired cove of the seashore. Enter Gemma. Gem. Come to me, Astrid, for my heart is broken. Enter Astrid from the sea. Ast. Alas, poor child! Gem. Oh, I can neither live Nor die without his pardon! Let me see him! Perhaps he is not dead! Ast. Would I might say so! He is dead indeedâe'en now his body floats Away to those cold seas that first he loved! Yet haply, oh, my Gemma! ere we part, I yet may bathe those wild glazed eyes of thine In sweeter, softer tears more like to joy. But tell me firstâdost thou still love Lorenzo? Gem. All he has been to me is so gone by, I neither love nor hate himâhe is nothing. Oh, Harold! Harold! Harold! How the life I had forgotten, rises up again In all its cruel, sweet reality! No more a child, I look back to the days When he was made so happy by my love, Although I never gave him back, alas! The thousandth part of what he gave to meâ For oh! through all the years we lived together, I cannot call back one luxurious memory Of words as fond as he would fain have heardâ One such outpouring of the heart as leaves it In after absence sadly satisfied, Absolved from sharp contrition for lost time. And, worst of all, I see unceasinglyâ And when I die, and roam abroad to seek, But never find, his ghostâI still shall seeâ Oh, the cold pang that chokes me while I speak!â His face of pale and uncomplaining pain, When he turned from me with a broken heart. I love him now, with all my power of loving, And never, never, never can assuage This bitter thirst to throw my arms once more Around his neck, and cry to him for pardon, And heal all he has suffered by my tears. And I have killed himâ'twas through me he died! Oh, when was creature half so lost as I? Ast. Alas! And what am I? I loved him too, And now o'er all the blue 'twixt pole and pole, May seek for him in vain. Gem. So then we two Are desolate and despairing! Help us, God! Ast. Despair not yetâI still may comfort thee, Hast thou but strength of soulâfor I can show thee, Reflected from some form invisibleâ If far or near, in earth, or out of it, Or in what essence framed, I cannot tell theeâ Here in this mirror him thou weep'st for so. He too shall look on thee as thou on himâ So shall you meet once more. Gem. Show it me, Astrid! All heaven seems opening on me. Ast. Wait, fond heart! Thou know'st not the conditions. If this blessing, This solace past all solace, ever yet Accorded to a mortal's misery, Thus groaning over the irrevocable, If this be granted thee, resign thyself To die, when thou hast had the full fruition Of thy heart's passionate wish. Gem. Let me but see him, And then die, Astrid. Ast. Oh, but yet consider, My Gemma, all the chances life still offers! Can beauteous womanhood be at thy years Blighted for life? Genius omnipotent In fashioning that outward lovelinessâ Granting therein expression to a soul As lovelyâpure and ardent as thine eyes, Warm as the summer rose upon thy cheek, Sweet as thy mouth, and graceful as thy hair, As delicate as this small, pointed hand, As playful as this music-loving footâ Oh, sure in giving this, it charmed thy being All fragile as it is, 'gainst fate itself! A thousand tempting paths lead up before thee To different heights, but each into a gardenâ The mystery of the future still is thine, And this but one strain of thy life's whole music! Wouldst thou but listen on, not close thine ears To all the rest, how know'st thou through what harmonies It yet may burst into a song of rapture? Gem. Astrid, in pity to a drowning soul, Stretch out thy hand, and bless me with the face I long to die for! Ast. Must I lose thee, then? So be it, Harold's darling! Die contentâ Look through this mirrorâtell me what thou seest. Gem. I see mine own faceânow it keeps retreatingâ And now a distant light......widening and brightening...... And now......'tis Harold! 'Tis himself! Oh, Astrid! He sees me, and he smiles! Yes, he forgives me. Oh, might I live on thus, just thus for ever! Harold, beloved Harold! Speak to me. Astrid, he seems to hear meâyes, his lips Move even, but I cannot hear a sound. Ast. Oh, passionate martyr! Such is earthly love That sings for rapture 'mid the funeral fires! Gem. Oh, Astrid! Astrid! Is this death? I feel All in a dizzy dreamâand yet so happy! Mer. (singing) Oh, moon! that art bathing tonight in this cove, Look down on this creature that's dying for love! With deep dazzling eyes, and with fast ebbing breathâ Like a bride on her mirror, she smiles upon death. Her heart-beats are numberedâthe moments are flying! All life, love, and beautyâyet dying, yet dying! Gem. He beckons with his hand! Will he be there To meet me, when I go? Ast. Alas, alas! Harold! My Harold! Wait for her yet longer. Gem. He has vanished. [Dies. Ast. I have done with earth for everâ The pain, the pain to love these human creatures! No more that sweet young voice shall speak to meâ She feels not now my kisses nor my tears! Mer. Now her life's love dream is dreamt and overâ Now let earth forget the loved and loverâ Now let all their sisters of the waves Weep and weave sea-garlands for their graves! Never let the faithless sons of men On her innocent beauty gaze again! Never let a faithless human tear Drop on her mysterious sepulchre! With flashing sea-pebbles, with clear-glowing amber, With weeds of gold, purple, and rose, In rainbow-like streamersâwe'll light up a chamber For Gemma's soft night of repose, Where down in the emerald deeps of the sea, Asleep 'mid the streams of her hair, She bathed in a luminous twilight shall be Eternally, changelessly fair. There, last of his race, shall be laid her sea-king To rest on his adamant bedâ There his own cast-away flag will we bring To shadow the stern, sleeping headâ There round our pale queen will we gather and sing, Every eve, of the dear and the dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Several years are supposed to have passed since the last Act. Scene I. âVenice. A Banquet in the Doge's Palace. The Doge, Zilia, Lorenzo, the Princess of Cyprus, &amp;c. All. Health to Lorenzo and his royal bride! Lor. I thank you, noble fellow-countrymen, For my beloved consort and myself. Zil. Hark! Music from the gondolas below! The noblest concert of rejoicing voices That Venice can lend breath to, fits the hourâ Why, what a mournful prelude! What means that? Song. Life is flowingâoh, how slow! To its sea of rest below; From its fountains in the past, Life is flowingâoh, how fast! Let it flow through joy or woe, It will find the sea at last. If mine eyes were not so dim, Filled with tears up to the brim, I could trace the changing stream Backwards, by its silver gleam, Where the happy lilies swim, Rocking in an idle dream. Softly went my boat along, In and through the flowery throng That smiled out upon the sun, But I never gathered one. I have passed those lilies long, But my voyage is not done. Other boats have passed me by, Dancingâoh, so merrily! Wings of cobweb, light and frail, These shall in the race prevail. I can only look and sigh, I toil on without a sail. Sometimes little isles I see Smiling greenly forth on me; Others pause, with joyful feet To search out each cool retreat, But I pass them sighingly, Drifting onward through the heat. Now the shady night is here, Now the cold sad stars appear; Once I wished the day was done, Now I wish I had the sun. But what matter? Death is near, And my course will soon be run. Lor. Sweet bride, you should have heard far other strains. Zil. Whence came that singer? Let him be dismissed. Lor. It was a kindred spirit sang to mineâ Methinks that song would fit my dying day. Zil. Hush, lest the Princess hear!âWhat, talk of death, The very day you bring so proudly home A radiant royal bride from o'er the sea, The breathing goddess of your poet-dreams? Lor. I brought once o'er the sea another bride. Zil. Ah! You remind me! Yes, this very day Indeed it wasâhow many years ago! Poor Gemma's scarf upon th' Ãgean waves Told the sad story of her own rash deed. Lor. Hush, there's another song! Let us hear this. Song. Not to-dayâoh, not to-day! This day I devote to sorrowâ Let me have this once my way, I will talk and laugh to-morrow. Let me find a place to weep, For my heart is full of tearsâ 'Tis the funeral feast I keep Of my youth's departed years. Let me call to memory's board Guests of long and long agoâ All the stars I so adored, All that have beguiled me so. All the madness of my youth, All its hope, and all its loveâ Nature struggling against truth, Angel-pitied from above! Save when dreaming in the dark, Now I scarcely can be sure I am he, so gay a bark On so vain a voyage bore. I would live as I have lived, In that wond'rous world againâ Broad awake, and undeceived, Act the drama of my pain Once more through. All present pleasure Seen beside old grief, turns paleâ Life was dealt in fuller measure, Framed upon a larger scale; And the day of days, whose gloom Stands most sacredly apart, Is that day when Gemma's doom Rang a death-bell in my heart. Zil. This is some blundering idler. Doge. What's this folly? Why does this whining serenader come On such an eve beneath my palace walls? Bid him begone on pain of chastisement. Lor. (to Zilia) You see I still am fated to recall That other bride, that other wedding day. Zil. That luckless song! How chanced he on that name? But fill a goblet with this wine of Cyprus, And drown therein the useless memory. Lor. I will go seek a yet more potent cordial. [Exit. Enter an Attendant, who approaches the Doge. Atten. My lord, the singer you have heard below, By birth a Naxiote, of a noble race, And skilled in music, wanders o'er the world, Stricken, they say, with melancholy madness, This many a year since the last Duchess died, Drowned on his native shores. Prin. Alas! Doge. Strange tale. Zil. Poor lover! wrecked by an insensate dream. My royal daughter, and my noble guests, Forgive, I pray, my son's strange-seeming absence. 'Tis but a faintnessâanxious hopes and fears Too long have strained his brain. Doge. Is my son ill? Re-enter Lorenzo. Zil. Noâhere he comes to answer for himself, Smilingâbut, heaven! how pale. Lor. Pardon, my Princess! This ill-timed faintness is already over. I am strengthened now with eagle gaze to bear The sunbeams of my dazzling happiness. Prin. And yet, my lord, you look but like a ghost That haunts his funeral feast. Lor. Perhaps 'tis mine Let all enjoy the mirth, though, whilst they mayâ I am not quite a ghost yet. Prin. How you jest! Lor. That cordial whose rare virtue so revived me, You see, has briskly mounted to my brain. [The banquet proceeds. Zil. My son! My son! Lorenzo! He is dead. [The Princess shrieks. All rise in confusion. L.</field>
