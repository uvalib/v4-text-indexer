      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. As Plants, while tender, bend which Way you please, And are, tho' Crooked first, made Straight with Ease; Yet if those Plants to their full Stature grow Irregular, they'll break before they'll bow: So Youth, set right at first, with Ease go on, And each new Task is with new Pleasure done; But if neglected till they grow in Years, And each sond Mother her dear Darling spares, Error becomes habitual, and you'll find, 'Tis then hard Labour to reform the Mind. Judge then, what Care Our Master's forc'd to take, T'examine every Word before we speak: To weigh each Thought, and see the Sense is chaste, And inoffensive to the nicest Taste: At the same Time to find out something New, Something to entertain both us and you; Something our Emulation to excite, And give Instruction whilst it gives Delight. The Scenes to-night, which we present to View, Great Addison (Great Britain's Censor) drew: From his Fair Rosamond our Drama's wrote, And tho' New-Christen'd, yet He form'd the Plot. Our Master owns he took his Scheme from thence, Vary'd indeed his Numbers, not his Sense; Alter'd to flowing Verse his tuneful Songs, And made them easy to our artless Tongues. In shortâ(and that's the most that can be said) He shews you Addison in Masquerade. What little Merit may be thought our Due, Is left to be determin'd now by You. To you, fair Judges, we submit our Cause, Yet hope for your Indulgence and Applause.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. A Prospect of Woodstock Park. Enter Queen, Cordelio, Henrietta, Chloris, and other Attendants. Queen. Come near, Cordelio:âWhat a Prospect's here! What lovely Scenes before our Eyes appear! Hark, how the Birds their amorous Descants sing, As if they dwelt in an Eternal Spring? When I survey this beauteous Place around, Methinks I tread on some enchanted Ground, Where New Elysiums charm my ravish'd Sight, And with their wild Variety delight. Here, flow'ry Mountains, there, thick shady Woods; Here, mossy Banks, and there, soft purling Floods; Here, hollow Vaults resound each Step I take, And there, a thousand Echoes round me speak. From Hill to Hill the trembling Voice is tost, And not the softest Word, or Whisper's lost. Cord. Madam, 'tis here the World's great Beauty lies, That sooths your Henry's Heart, and charms his Eyes: Within this Bower Fair Rosamond resides, Secur'd from You, and all Mankind besides. Queen. Curse on the fatal Name! Curse on the Grove! I burn, I die, with Jealousy and Love. Hen. Within this Bow'r the pensive Nymph does mourn, And languishes for her lov'd Lord's Return. Her restless Thoughts like tumbling Surges roll, And thence disclose the Secrets of her Soul. Now anxious Fears, now rising Hopes come on; But soon the Prospect like a Shadow's gone. The two Extremes possess her Soul by turns, And her fond Heart each Moment chills, and burns. Queen. She has rous'd a raging Lion in my Breast, Which till the Traitress dies, shall never rest. Chlo. Like dying Birds her panting Bosom swells, And every Motion her warm Passion tells. To that soft Nest your Henry will repair, And in her Arms forget the Toils of War. On that dear Pillow breathe his am'rous Pray'rs, And amply make amends for all her Cares. Queen. Trifler no moreâMy Vengeance is too slowâ [to Cordelio] Lead me, I charge you, (if the Way you know) To the blest Mansion of my Lovely Foe. My Wrath like that of angry Heav'n shall rise, And blast her tho' she dwells in Paradise. Cord. Madam, the Bow'r's on yonder rising Ground, That runs and wanders an eternal Round. Queen. Unhappy I, in such a Maze do rove, Lost in the Labyrinth of endless Love! My anxious Breast with hoarded Vengeance burns, While Fears and Hopes possess my Soul by turns. Cord. The winding Path yon verdant Field divides, Which to the Fair One's soft Confinement guides. Queen. Oh! Eleonora, think, and think betimes, Upon the Nature of thy Rival's Crimes. What has she done to raise thy Rage so high? What has she done, that she deserves to die? My Heart recoils, and fain would be at Ease. ButâIs not she the Murdress of my Peace?â Doesn't she warm with the most guilty Fires The dearest Object of my chaste Desires? Have not her subtle Arts and fatal Charms Remov'd my faithless Henry from my Arms?â I'm all on fire againâshe dies, she dies,â 'Tis Crime enough to have such conqu'ring Eyesâ âYet holdâmethinks I feel my Heart relent; The Fair One could not well be innocent. What Vestal Virgin would not soon resign To such a Lover, such a Prince as mine? To One so great, and One so truly brave, The Proudest Nymph might well become a Slave. [A Flourish of Trumpets sounding at a Distance. Cord. Hark, Madam, hark! what Sounds invades my Ear! The awful Conqueror's Approach is near. Hen. He comes, he comes, Victorious Henry comes; I hear his Martial Trumpets, Flutes, and Drums; Which joined in Concert echo from afar, Fill every Wind, and beat a Point of War. Queen. Henry returns, 'tis true, from Danger free, My Lord returns, but not alas! to me. He comes his beauteous Rosamond to greet, And lay his warlike Trophies at her Feet! His ardent Vows impatient to renew, His ardent Vows to Eleonora due! Shall then Fair Rosamond my Lord detain, While I his Absence mourn, and mourn in vain? Oh, no! my Heart will breakâit is decreedâ The fatal Beauty shall this Moment bleed. No Fear, no Horror shall my Soul alarm, No soothing Pity shall my Rage disarm; But to her Cost the Traytress soon shall know, What 'tis a Queen, provok'd like me, can do. [She goes out in Disorder, her Attendants following after. SCENE II. The Grove before the Bower. Enter Rosamond with an Ovid in her Hand, attended by Violante and Florella. She walks and reads Dido's Complaint of Eneas. Ãneas is my Thoughts perpetual Theme, Their daily Longing, and their nightly Dream; Yet he is ungrateful and obdurate still: Fool that, I am to place my Heart so ill! &amp;c. Rs. Who can, Fair Queen, thy soft Complainings hear, And not be mov'd, not shed a pitying Tear? My Griefs alas! too much resemble thine; Ãneas is thy Torment, Henry mine. Ãneas wounds thee with his cold Disdain, And Henry's Absence gives me equal Pain. [Here she gives Violante the Book and goes on. From Walk to Walk, from gloomy Shade to Shade, From purling Stream to purling Stream convey'd, Thro' all the winding Mazes of the Grove, Restless I range o'erwhelm'd with Grief and Love. O! where for Ease shall Rosamonda fly? If Henry stays much longer I shall die. Viol. Dear Madam, do not thus indulge your Woe; In vain your Tears like tumbling Surges flow. To sooth your Griefs your Sighs all fruitless prove; They only aggravate the Pangs of Love. Was Henry false, and lov'd another more, Justly you might your Rival's Charms deplore; But surely without Cause you mourn your Fate, Since Henry is as Constant as he's Great. Ros. I grant it true, yet still he is not here, And I, alas! his Absence cannot bear; Each Moment, Violante, seems a Year. O! that indulgent Morpheus would arise, And with soft Slumbers close my wearied Eyes! Some Rest, though but imaginary, give! For 'tis a Pain without my Love to live. Flor. Though Love's the softest Blessing of our Lives, The noblest Passion that a Soul conceives; Yet was that Love but one continued Joy, Twou'd pall upon our Hands, and quickly cloy. Our Sense of Pleasure is not half so great, If nothing interrupts our peaceful State; If no small Cares, no Troubles intervene; If 'tis all Sun-Shine, if 'tis all serene. A gentle Breeze adds Beauty to the Floods, And the Sky's gayest when 'tis mixt with Clouds. Viol. The Palm-Tree, Madam, by Oppression grows, And amidst Thorns the best of Flow'rs, the Rose. Your Henry's Absence will inflame him more, Add Wings to his Desires, his Love secure. Ros. Sure adverse Winds have with my Stars combin'd, To ruin my Content, my Peace of Mind! Resolv'd, with Force united, to divide What Love, and all our Vows so strongly ty'd! Perhaps I ne'er shall see my Henry more: Perhaps he's shipwreckt on some distant Shore: That Thought confounds me, drives me to Despair; That Shock's too great for my fond Heart to bear. Flor. Blame not the Winds which now your Lord detain; Those Winds may turn, may blow him back again, And doubly recompence your present Pain: Nor blame the Stars for his too long Delay, Or think that they unite their partial Sway To interrupt your Loves; or Fears create, To make your mutual Joys the less compleat. Sometimes the Stars themselves will lose their Light, Be all obscur'd by the thick Shades of Night; Yet soon those Shades to distant Regions glide, And then they triumph, and resume their Pride. The same Vicissitude all Nature shares, Dies, and revives, looks gay, or gloomy like the Stars. Viol. The Winter Blasts deform our rural Seat, And drive the Turtle from his constant Mate; Cause a long Separation, make him rove, Forlorn, and mournful through the leafless Grove: But when returning Spring the Shades renews, With Pleasure he the verdant Trees reviews; His former Solitude bemoans no more, But bills and cooes more closely than before. Ros. I thank you for your Council and your Love; But all your Arguments, tho' strong, will prove Too weak a Charm my Sorrows to remove. Nothing, alas! can e'er assuage my Pain, Till Henry comes to my Embrace again. Flor. Let not Despair thus wreck your tender Breast I'll sing, and tune your tortur'd Soul to Rest. Since all our Words have lost their Pow'r to please, Musick perhaps may give your Sorrows Ease. Musick has Charms, I've heard, to soften Rocks, To temper Brutes, and bend the knotted Oaks; To make the worst of Foes the dearest Friends, And mitigate the Tortures of the Fiends. Viol. When in Times past the Royal Hebrew's Breast Glow'd with Revenge, with anxious Cares opprest, The Young JessÃ¦an tun'd his Harp so well, The Monarch's Passion in a Moment fell: His gloomy Thoughts were on a sudden gone, Like dreary Mists at the approaching Sun. The charming Sounds soon gave his Sorrows Ease, And all was Harmony, and all was Peace. Flor. So when of Old kind Orpheus did repair To the dark Shades of Night and black Despair, To seek the Darling of his Heart, and found her there; In Pluto's Presence strait his Lyre he strung, Tuneful he play'd, and tunefully he sung. The sullen God, regardless of his Pains, Listen'd with Pleasure to his moving Strains; Approv'd his Musick, and his Voice so well, That he releas'd Eurydice from Hell. Ros. Well then, since Musick has such Pow'r to charm, To sooth the Mournful, and the Fierce disarm, Why should its Power on me alone be lost? Why should not I its equal Virtues boast? Begin, I'll listen to thy tuneful Strains, They'll sure diminish, if not heal my Pains. [Rosamond seats herself in an easy Chair, whilst Florella sings the following Song. The CONSOLATION. I. The Pains which Absence does create, True Lovers only know: Cupid's a Tyrant, and delights To aggravate their Woe. II. But at the last the God relents, And the fond Couple meet: Their former Separation makes Their present Joys more sweet. III. So when the Waves like Mountains rise, And Clouds condense the Sky, The tim'rous Sailor trembling stands, And thinks his Fate is nigh. IV. But when the Sun with Magick Pow'r Dispels those Mists away; When the rough Ocean's lull'd asleep, And all around looks gay: V. Unmindful of his former Fears, He boldly ventures on: The Pleasures of the present Calm For the past Storm atone. After the Song Rosamond rises. Ros. Thanks to my Friends: Methinks my Griefs are gone; Vanish'd like Stars before the rising Sun. Farewel:âI'll now retire within the Bow'r, And wait with Patience for the happy Hour, When the kind Winds shall waft my Henry o'er, And Land my Lover safe on Albion's Shore. [She goes out, Florella follows her. SCENE. III. Violante alone. Martial Musick is heard at a Distance. Viol. What Musick's that? what grateful Sound invades My Ears, and echoes through the winding Shades? 'Tis Henry's fav'rite March, the Tune I know: A Messenger at least! It must be so. SCENE. IV. Enter a Messenger. Mes. Great Henry comes with ardent Love opprest, You must prepare to lodge the Royal Guest. Viol. The Bow'r and Lady both are ready drest, Fit to receive so great, so good a Guest. Mes. Soon as the British Shores the Victor reach'd, With speed his foaming Courser hither stretch'd: And see! he comes; his eager Steps prevent The very Message which himself hath sent. SCENE V. Enter King Henry, after a Flourish of Trumpets. King. Where is my Love, the Queen of my Desires? The dearest Partner of my softest Fires? My Heart's impatient of the least Delay, And every Moment seems a lazy Day. Viol. Within yon Grove the pensive Fair does mourn, And languishes all Day for your Return. In vain I strive to tune her Soul to Rest; Nothing will please till with her Monarch blest. Your Presence only can her Joys restore; No Eyes, but those that wound the Fair, can cure. King. Was ever Nymph so fair, so true, so fond? Was ever Angel like my Rosamond? With every Charm adorn'd, and every Grace, With endless Pleasure I her Beauties trace, And my fond Heart springs to her soft Embrace. Viol. The Sight of you will soon the Fair revive, And to her Charms a double Lustre give. King. Well then! with Speed I'll to the Grove repair: For, oh! I own my Bliss all centers there. There will I shine like the great God of Day, And dissipate, like Clouds, her Cares away. [Turns to his Guards. Mean while, I charge you, with Attention wait, To guard the Bow'r, and watch the outward Gate. Let neither Envy, Grief, nor idle Fear, Nor any Love-sick Jealousy appear; Nor senseless Pomp, nor noisy Crowds intrude On this Recess, this grateful Solitude: But Pleasures only reign through all the Grove, And all around be Peace, and all be Love. The End of the First ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Pavilion in the Middle of the Bower. Enter King, Rosamond, Violante, Florella, Guards, and other Attendants. King. Thus let my weary Soul at length forget The anxious Pleasures that attend the Great Conquest and Glory let the Warrior prize, And softer Charms with haughty Pride despise; Arms and the dusty Field I'll seek no more: Thy lovely Eyes have Arbritary Power. Ros. Thus let me live retir'd, of thee possest, Thou best of Partners, and of Princes best. Thy Presence only can my Fears controul, Heal my unquiet Mind, and tune my Soul. King. Not British Shouts that rend the vaulted Sky, Not bloody Plains where hostile Colours fly, Not the Gauls Trumpets sounding a Retreat, Not thousand Captives prostrate at my Feet, Give half those Transports that possess my Breast, While thus I'm with my lovely Charmer blest. Ros. With Ease, alas! we credit what we love. But will my dearest Henry never rove? From his dear Bosom shall I ne'er be torn? Ne'er live again forsaken and forlorn? Will he be only, be forever mine? Shall neither Time nor Age our Souls disjoin? Shall no New Beauty his fond Heart surprise, And make him own the Triumph of her Eyes? King. Hear solemn Jove, and conscious Venus hear, And thou bright Maid believe me whilst I swear; No Time, no Change, no future Flame shall move The well-placed Basis of my lasting Love. Should all thy Charms to wrinkled Age give way, Should Sickness make thy Graces all decay, Thy coral Lips forsake their charming Red, Thy Cheeks look pale, and Life it self seem fled; Yet so much Goodness would be left behind, As would oblige me to be ever kind. For when those Eyes have once a Conquest won, The Captive must their Pow'r forever own. Ros. Pardon the Thought; I own 'twas rash and vain, A false Idea, and a fansy'd Pain. Henceforth I'll all my future Hours employ, Subservient only to my Henry's Joy; Henceforth I'll from my Heart all Doubts remove, And think myself more happy in thy Love, Than Juno in the soft Embrace of Jove. King. Forever blest be Cytherea's Shrine: May Fires eternal on her Altars shine! Since so much Truth in Rosamonda's found; Since in her Kindness my Ambition's crown'd; Since by each tender Look, each Thought, I see Her Joys and Sorrows center all in me. And sure I am, I wouldn't change this Hour, For all the Pomp, and all the Pride of Pow'r. Ros. Oh! I could ever hear thy charming Tongue, (Thy Voice is sweeter than the Syren's Song) And never think the happy Hours too long. No Woman sure was e'er so truly blest, Nor of so great a Monarch's Heart possest, King. No Prince was e'er so happy sure, to find A Maid so beauteous and so wondrous kind. Oh! may our present Happiness endure, From Fortune, Time, and envious Death secure! Ros. Oh! may this Harmony forever last, And every Hour prove happier than the past! King. Trumpets and Drums shall celebrate our Bliss, And Albion keep a Festival for this. New Ways I'd study to oblige my Fair, And thy Diversion shall be all my Care. Go, Violante, call your Partners in, And let your Rural Pastimes now begin. [Here may be introduced any short Pastoral Dialogues, Songs, Figure-Dances, or any other Entertainments, as the Mistress shall think proper.] After the Interludes are over, the King and Rosamond rise. King. Now, my fair Angel, I must take my Leave, And give my wearied Eyes a short Reprieve. In yon cool Grotto's artificial Night, Refreshing Slumbers I'll a while invite; Then seek again, revived, my absent Fair, With all the Love a tender Heart can bear. [He goes out. SCENE II. Rosamond alone. From whence arise these sad presaging Fears, These sudden Starts, these Sighs, and falling Tears? Oft in my silent Dreams, at Dead of Night, I've seen, methought, Great Henry take his Flight, Wafted by Angels thro' the Realms of Light: While I, alas! abandon'd and forlorn, To some unheard-of gloomy Desart born, Have seem'd, thro' pathless Wilds, alone to stray, Without one Sun-Beam to direct my Way. 'Tis Fiction all, and I will grieve no more: My Life has endless Blessings still in Store. Hence every Thought and every anxious Care, 'Tis Fiction all, for my lov'd Henry's here. [She goes out. SCENE III. The Entry of the Bower. Enter Cordelio alone. Oh! the gay Prospect, the delicious View! Forever charming, and forever new! Here, lovely Greens of various Shades arise, Bedeck'd with fragrant Flowers of various Dyes: There, Fountains playing thro' the shady Trees, Add new Refreshment to the gentle Breeze. Here, stands a Rock; there, rolls a purling Stream: Sure 'tis a Vision! sure 'tis all a Dream! SCENE IV. Enter Queen, Henrietta, Chloris, and other Attendants. Queen. The Bow'ry Vaults before my Eyes appear! My Bosom pants with an unusual Fear: A Thousand Checks my timorous Heart controul; A Thousand Sorrows shake my guilty Soul. I see, with Horror see, my Hands embru'd In purple Streams of my fair Rival's Blood. Methinks I see the Victim gasp for Breath, And start, and struggle in the Pangs of Death. Methinks I see my raging, dying Lord: And oh! curst Fate, I see myself abhorr'd. Cord. My Eyes o'er flow, my Heart with Grief is torn, To hear my Queen, my Royal Mistress mourn. [Aside. Queen. What Methods shall my trembling Soul pursue? Teach me, ye Powers, Oh! teach me what to do. Cord. Behold! Great Queen, that shady Bow'r will shew Where lies conceal'd your fair, your guilty Foe. That conscious Scene of lawless Love contains The fatal Cause of all your anxious Pains. Queen. In yonder Vale I know my Rival lies:â It is decreed,âIt shall be so,âShe dies.â Help me Cordelio quickly to destroy Her matchless Guilt, and her unbounded Joy. No Sorrow sure can e'er with mine compare! What Heart, tho' ne'er so great, can ever bear The Pangs of raging Love, and wild Despair? [She goes out, Cordelio and the rest of her Attendants follow her. SCENE V. Enter Rosamond alone. O Ravishing Delight! O rising Joy! No anxious Cares shall now my Peace annoy. To meet thy Bliss m' exalted Soul prepare: A Noise without. My Henry comes, his well-known Steps I hear. âWhat do I see?âMy Fate, alas! draws nigh. My injur'd Queen?âI'm doom'd, I fear, to die. SCENE VI. Enter the Queen, with a Bowl of Poison in one Hand, and a Dagger in the other. Henrietta and Chloris follow at a Distance. Queen. Thus arm'd with double Death, resolv'd I'm come: Behold, vain Sorceress, behold thy Doom. Thy mighty Crimes to their full Period tend, And This,âor This,âforthwith thy Days shall end. Ros. What shall I say? or how shall I reply To the just Threats of your wrong'd Majesty? Queen. 'Tis Guilt that does thy fault'ring Tongue controul: Be quick, and drink up all this fatal Bowl; Or this Right Hand performs her Tragic Part, And plants a Dagger in thy treacherous Heart. Ros. Oh! can Britannia's Queen give such Commands, Or can she dye in Blood her sacred Hands? Shall such Resentments fire her generous Breast? Britannia's Queen should such dark Deeds detest. Oh! think, when Tides of youthful Blood run high, When Scenes of long-expected Joys draw nigh, 'Tis double Death at such a Time to die. Queen. To thee, whose Fame's become a Publick Stain, That Life thou plead'st for should be thought a Pain. Ros. Who could resist thy Henry's matchless Charms, And banish such a Hero from her Arms? Oh! think a little on the tender Fires, The melting Thoughts and languishing Desires, That fill your Breast, when you the Charmer see; Think on yourself, and sure you'll pity me. Queen. And dost thou thus thy horrid Guilt deplore? Thy Fate is seal'd, and I will hear no more. [Holds a Dagger to her Breast. Ros. O gracious Queen! your lifted Arm restrain; Behold these Tears!âLet them not flow in vain. Oh! let Compassion in your Bosom rise, And hear with Pity my repenting Sighs. Queen. In vain thou striv'st to move me with thy Tears; Fruitless are all thy Sighs, in vain thy Prayers. Hope not a Day, no, not an Hour's Reprieve. Ros. Tho' I live miserable, let me live. In some dark Cave let me forgotten lie, Banished the Day, and every human Eye: Offended Heav'n ev'n there I will adore, Nor wish to see the Sun, or Henry more. Queen. Why does my tardy Vengeance thus delay? My Arm this Moment shall my Rage obey. Ros. Madam thus prostrate at your Feet I fall: Let me one Moment still for Mercy call! [Kneels. Queen. Mercy to Crimes less heinous may be due; But Death and Horror shall thy Crimes pursue. Ros. This fatal Bowl shall then prevent the Blow.â [Drinks. Oh! whither will my parted Spirits go? Queen. Where thou thy Crimes forever shalt lament, And wish in vain thou hadst been innocent. Ros. Tyrant, my dying Soul with Fury burns, And slighted Sorrow into Madness turns. Think not, imperious Author of my Woe, That dying Rosamond will leave thee so. My murther'd Ghost shall haunt thee in the Night, And with her hideous Screams thy Soul affright. And, when the Night her sable Curtain draws, Thy Lord, my Henry, shall revenge my Cause.â Whither, Oh! whither does my Frenzy drive? Forgive my Passion, and your Wrongs forgive. My Veins are frozen, and my Blood grows chill, And all the weary Springs of Life stand still. Death's icy Hand benumbs my Life all o'er, And now your hated Rival is no more. [Sinks down into an easy Chair. Queen. When Vanquish'd Foes beneath us prostrate lie, Is it not very great to bid them die? But how much greater is it to forgive, To set them free, and let the Captives live! Turns to Henrietta and Chloris. Draw nigh, my Friends, and mark your Queen's Commands; Beneath yon Hills a private Convent stands, Where the fam'd Streams of Isis softly stray; Thither the breathless Coarse forthwith convey, And bid the Cloyster'd Nuns, with pious Care, The solemn Funeral Rites this Night prepare. They carry Rosamond off. Queen alone. Now, now the Conflict of my Mind is o'er, And faithless Rosamond shall charm no more. Hence every Thought and every anxious Care; Hence every Torment that attends Despair. Now shall my Henry live with me alone; Now the gay Hero shall be all my own. Scepters and Crowns could no such Transports give; 'Tis Pain without my Better Half to live. The End of the Second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. Scene I. A Grotto. The King asleep upon a Bank of Flowers. A Cloud descends, and in it four Guardian Angels, with Emblems in their Hands of War and Peace. The first comes forward, and sings Genius of England. After the Song is ended, all join in a Figure Dance, to a Martial Tune. 1st Angel. See, how dejected Albion's Monarch lies! Restless in Thought, tho' Sleep has clos'd his Eyes. Let us with double Diligence attend; For on our Care his future Joys depend. 2d Ang. In Fields of Death my Post shall be, to spread A Shield of Adamant around his Head. 3d Ang. And mine, in Peace to guard the Throne unseen, And reconcile the Hero and the Queen. 4th Ang. When Hosts of Foes the Warrior shall surround, Bravely he shall retreat without a Wound. I will engage their Fauchions to misguide, And turn their pointed Arrows all aside. 1st Ang. When Factions shall at Home begin to swell, And prompt th'ambitious Soldiers to rebel; Such inward Fears, such Terrors I'll create, As shall their best form'd Plots at once defeat. 2d Ang. But who has Skill sufficient to remove The Pangs of Sorrow, and the Rage of Love? 3d Ang. I'll fire his Godlike Soul with mighty Themes. 4th Ang. And I'll his Troubles sooth in pleasing Dreams. 1st Ang. So shall fond Love before Ambition fly, And boundless Grief in endless Raptures die. 2d Ang. Whate'er in British Annals can be found, That's truly great, heroic, and renown'd; Whate'er uncommon Actions shall adorn Great Britain's Champions that are yet unborn, In visionary Slumbers shall succeed: The Gauls shall in imaginary Battles bleed. Cressy shall stand before the Monarch's Eyes, And Agincourt's and Blenheim's Conquests rise. 3d Ang. Behold! Great Henry smiles amidst his Trance, And shakes, with seeming Joy, a fansy'd Lance. His thoughtful Brain is fill'd with loud Alarms, The Shouts of Armies, and the Clash of Arms.â See! Glory strives:âThe Field at last is won:â Honour revives, and lawless Passion's gone. 4th Ang. The God of Love now pleads his Cause in vain; Now Henry's Heart is Proof to every Pain. His growing Pleasures can no Compass keep, And are too vehement, too fierce for Sleep. [The Angels ascend, and the Vision disappears. SCENE II. Henry starting from the Couch. Sure, in some Fairy Land I've lately been! Such mighty Joys, such Wonders I have seen! Still does the Prospect stand before my Eyes, And still a Crowd of glorious Objects rise: A thousand Fights, and Triumphs immature, That lie in deep Futurity obscure, Break forth, and to the open Day display'd, Too plain my soft, inglorious Hours upbraid. Transported with so bright, so gay a Scheme, My waking Life appears, methinks, a Dream.â Farewel, ye rosy Brakes, a long Adieu: Henry no more must think of Love, or you. O beauteous Rosamond! O rising Woe! Why do my weeping Eyes so fast o'erflow? How shall my trembling Heart it's Purpose tell, And bear to take her long, her last Farewel?â Rise, Great Ambition, rise in all thy Charms, Thy gilded Banners spread, and burnish'd Arms. Let the Drums beat, and the shrill Trumpets join To animate my Soul with Rage divine. Try all thy Arts my Passion to remove; 'Twill ask them all, to vanquish lawless Love. [He goes out. SCENE III. A Table, on which stands the Queen's Bowl, with the Dagger lying by it, and a Letter directed to the King, with Information of the Death of Rosamond. Enter the Queen alone. Look down, ye Stars, ye Pow'rs divine, look down, And make the Cause of Innocence your own. Instruct my Tongue my Henry to assuage, Revive his Love, or mitigate his Rage.â But see! my Lord appears, he hither flies, And Lightning flashes in his angry Eyes.â I dread the Storm, and therefore will retire, Lest Sight of me should fan his Passions higher. [She retires to the farther End of the Stage. SCENE IV. Enter the King. My Heart presages some ill Fate is near! Why should I tremble else, unus'd to fear? Why should my Soul with secret Horror shake? No idle Dreams could such Impressions make. What means this melancholy, silent Show, This Pomp of Death, this tragic Scene of Woe? [Surveys the Bowl and Dagger, and peruses the Letter. Death to my Eyes!âWhat News is this I read.â Great Sir, your beauteous Rosamond is dead.â What shall I say, or whither shall I turn? With Rage and Love alternately I burn. From Thought to Thought my restless Soul is tost, And in the Whirl of boundless Passion lost.â Why did I not, ye Powers, in Battle fall, Crush'd by the mighty Thunder of the Gaul? Why did my Bosom miss the pointed Spear? Life's now a Torment that's too great to bear.â But see! the fatal Cause of all my Fears, The Queen comes forward. The Source of all my Sorrows now appears.â Madam, no unexpected Guest is here; That Bowl declar'd Britannia's Queen was near. Queen. Why in these Shades do I my Lord receive? King. Is this the Welcome, Madam, that you give? Queen. Thus coldly should divided Lovers meet? King. And is it thus, that we like Strangers greet? Queen. What Pleasures could these guilty Shades afford, Becoming thee, Mine, and Great England's Lord? Degenerate Thoughts, I fear, have fir'd your Breast. King. The Thirst of Blood, I fear, has yours possest. Thy Hands my Rosamonda's Blood has shed. Oh! tell me, Tygress, where the Maid's convey'd; In Floods of Sorrow I'll lament her Shade. No Nymph e'er mov'd with such a graceful Air; No Rose e'er smelt so sweet, no Lilly look'd so fair. Queen. My Lord, I see your Heart with Anguish torn; 'Tis Death to me to see my Henry mourn. The Living, Sir, you mourn, while injur'd I, To be so lov'd, so moan'd, would freely die. King. Does she then live?âOh! speak that Word again: Why will you dally with a Monarch's Pain? Queen. Was your Fair Rosamond, my Foe, alive, Wouldn't your Love, and all my Wrongs revive? King. Oh! No.âBy wondrous Visions from above, I'm summon'd to the Field, and freed from Love. Queen. O joyful News!âThen cease, my Lord, to grieve, And know your Rosamonda's still alive.â The Bowl by me with drowsy Juices fill'd, From cold Egyptian Drugs by Art distill'd, In borrow'd Death has clos'd awhile her Eyes; But soon the waking Nymph again shall rise, In a close Convent, far-remov'd shall shine, And spend her Time in Songs and Hymns divine: Shall make Atonement for herself, and you, And bid the guilty World with Joy Adieu. King. How blest is Henry, if this News be true! In Life and Bliss do but secure the Fair, I'll never ask you how she lives, or where. Forever from my youthful Fancy fled, May the whole World declare, and think her dead. The Charms of Beauty I'll no more pursue: But wish alone to live and die with you. Queen. How does my joyful Heart, for such a Prize, The Censures of th'ill-judging World despise! Oh! change no more, and I'll forgive what's past, Think all a Dream, and Rosamonda chaste. King. This wondrous Goodness how shall I repay? Forever blest be this auspicious Day! Sure none would to forbidden Pleasures rove, That ever knew the Sweets of Virtuous Love. Queen. Marriage alone can solid Joys dispense, And join true Happiness with Innocence. King. This Reconcilement let the Goddess Fame, With her shrill Trump, to distant Realms proclaim: Whilst here, at Home, we revel in Delight, And close, with a Short Ball, this happy Night. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. As timorous Sailors, when the Surges beat, And rouze th'Old Ocean from his calm Retreat, With aching Hearts behold the Tempest rise, And wish to Make the Shore with weeping Eyes: Yet, when the Wind's allay'd, all Sorrow's gone, Thoughtless of Dangers past, All venture on, And one calm Hour does for the Storm atone. So We, when we appear in Public View, Are apprehensive of each Look from You: Fearful, lest our Attempt your Frowns should raise, And meet with Censure, whilst we aim at Praise. But when we find that You espouse our Cause, And raise our drooping Spirits with Applause; With a fresh Ardour we Our Tasks renew, And spare no Pains to be approv'd by You. To you, Kind Ladies, we for Refuge fly: Let your Good Nature our Defects supply. Your wonted Charms let generous Smiles display, And drive our little Fears, like Mists, away. Accept of what we've done, tho' done amiss, And with Applause our Harmless Sports dismiss. This New Essay let your Indulgence spare, We'll Practise thus before you Once a Year. But, should Our Task to Night your Spleen procure, We'll ask Forgiveness, and Offend no more.</field>
