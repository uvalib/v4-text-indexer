      <field name="fulltext">To my much Honoured, and most true Friends, Sir Philip Knyvet, Knight and Baronet And to Sir Thomas Ieay, Knight. And Thomas Bellingham of Newtimber in Sussex Esquire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his deare Friend the Author. I am no great admirer of the Playes, Poets, or Actors, that are now adayes: Yet in this Worke of thine me thinkes I see Sufficient reason for Idolatrie. Each line thou hast taught Ceasar is, as high As Hee could speake, when groueling Flatterie, And His owne pride (forgetting Heavens rod) By His Edicts stil'd himselfe great Lord and God. By thee againe the Lawrell crownes His Head; And thus reviu'd, who can affirme him dead? Such power lyes in this loftie straine as can Giue Swords, and legions to Domitian. And when thy Paris pleades in the defence Of Actors, every grace, and excellence Of Argument for that subject, are by Thee Contracted in a sweete Epitome. Nor doe thy Women the tyr'd Hearers vexe, With language no way proper to their sexe. Iust like a cunning Painter thou lets fall Copies more faire then the Originall. I'll adde but this. From all the moderne Playes The Stage hath lately borne, this winnes the Bayes. And if it come to tryall boldly looke To carrie it cleere, Thy witnesse being thy Booke. T. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his deseruing Friend Mr. Philip Massinger, vpon his TragÃ¦die, the Roman Actor. Paris, the best of Actors in his age Acts yet, and speakes vpon our Roman Stage Such lines by thee, as doe not derogate From Romes proud heights, and Her then learned State. Nor great Domitians fauour; not th'embraces Of a faire Empresse, nor those often graces Which from th'applauding Theaters were pay'd To His braue Action, nor His ashes layd In the Flaminian way, where people strow'd His Graue with flowers, and Martialls wit bestow'd A lasting Epitaph, not all these same Doe adde so much renowne to Paris name, As this that thou present'st his Historie So well to vs. For which in thankes would Hee (If that His soule, as thought Pithagoras Could into any of our Actors passe) Life to these Lines by action gladly giue Whose Pen so well has made His storie liue. Tho: May.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vpon Mr. Massinger His Roman Actor. To write, is growne so common in our Time That euery one, who can but frame a Rime Howeuer monstrous, giues Himselfe that praise Which onely Hee should claime, that may weare Bayes By their Applause whose judgements apprehend The weight, and truth, of what they dare commend. In this besotted Age (friend) 'tis thy glory That Heere thou hast out-done the Roman story. Domitians pride; His wiues lust vnabated In death; with Paris, meerly were related Without a Soule, Vntill thy abler Pen Spoke them, and made them speake, nay Act agen In such a height, that Heere to know their Deeds Hee may become an Actor that but Reades. John Foorde.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Long'st thou to see proud CÃ¦sar set in State, His Morning greatnesse, or his Euening fate? With admiration heere behold him fall And yet out-liue his tragique Funerall: For 'tis a question whether CÃ¦sars Glorie Rose to its heighth before, or in this Storie. Or whether Paris in Domitians fauour Were more exalted, then in this thy labour. Each line speakes him an Emperour, eu'ry phrase Crownes thy deseruing temples with the Bayes; So that reciprocally both agree Thou liu'st in him and Hee surviues in Thee. Robert Harvey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To His long knowne and lou'd Friend, Mr. Philip Massinger, vpon His Roman Actor. If that my Lines being plac'd before thy Booke Could make it sell, or alter but a looke Of some sowre Censurer, who's apt to say No one in these Times can produce a Play Worthy his reading, since of late, 'tis true The old accepted are more then the new. Or could I on some Spot o'the Court worke so To make him speake no more then He doth know; Not borrowing from His flattering flatter'd friend What to dispraise, or wherefore to commend. Then (gentle Friend) I should not blush to bee Rank'd 'mongst those worthy ones, which heere I see Vshering this Worke, but why I write to Thee Is to professe our loues Antiquitie, Which to this TragÃ¦die must giue my test, Thou hast made many good, but this thy best. Ioseph Taylor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actvs, I. ScÃ¦na, I. Enter Paris, Latinus, Ãsopus. Ãsop. What doe wee acte to day? Latinus. Agaves phrensie With Pentheus bloudie end. Paris. It skils not what The times are dull, and all that wee receiue Will hardly satisfie the dayes Expence. The Greekes (to whom we owe the first inuention Both of the buskind scÃ¦ne and humble stocke) That raigne in euery noble familie Declaime against vs: and our Amphitheater, Great Pompies worke, that hath giu'n full delight Both to the eye, and eare of fifty thousand Spectators in one day, as if it were Some vnknowne desert, or great Roome vnpeopl'd, Is quite forsaken. Latin. Pleasures of worse natures Are gladly entertayn'd, and they that shun vs, Practise in priuate sports the Stewes would blush at. A Litter borne by eight Liburnian staues, To buy Diseases from a glorious strumper, The most censorious of our Roman gentrie, Nay of the guarded robe the Senators, Esteeme an easie purchase, Paris. Yet grudge vs (That with delight joyne profit and endeauour To build their mindes vp faire, and on the Stage Decipher to the life what honours waite On good, and glorious actions, and the shame That treads vpon the heeles of vice. The salarie Of six Sestertij: Ãsop. For the profit Paris, And mercinarie gaine they are things beneath vs Since while you hold your grace, and power with CÃ¦sar, We from your bounty finde a large supply, Nor can one thought of want euer approach vs, Par. Our aime is glorie, and to leaue our names To after times. Latin. And would they giue vs leaue There ends all our ambition. Ãsop. Wee haue enemies And great ones too, I feare. 'Tis giuen out lately The Consull Aretinus (CÃ¦sars spie) Sayd at his Table ere a moneth expir'd (For being gald in our last Comedie) He would silence vs for euer. Par. I expect No fauour from him, my strong Auentine is That great Domitian, whom we oft haue cheer'd In his most sullen moodes will once returne, Who can repayre with ease, the Consuls ruines. Lat. 'Tis frequent in the Citie, he hath subdued The Catti, and the Daci, and ere long, The second time will enter Rome in triumph. Enter two Lictors. Par. Ioue hasten it, with vs? I now beleeue The Consuls threates Ãsopus. 1. Lict. You are summon'd T'appeare to day in Senate. 2. Lict. And there to answer What shall be vrg'd against you. Par. We obey you. Nay droope not fellowes, innocence should be bould We that haue personated in the Sceane The ancient Heroes, and the falles of Princes With loude applause, being to act our selues, Must doe it with vndaunted confidence. What ere our sentence be thinke 'tis in sport. And though condemn'd lets heare it without sorrow As if we were to liue againe to morrow. 1. Lict. 'Tis spoken like your selfe. Enter Ãlius, Lamia, Junius, Rusticus, Palphuris, Sura. Lam. Whether goes Paris? 1. Lict. He's cited to the Senate. Lat. I am glad the State is So free from matters of more waight and trouble That it has vacant time to looke on vs. Par. That reuerend place, in which the affaires of Kings, And prouinces were determin'd, to descend To the censure of a bitter word, or iest, Drop'd from a Poets pen! peace to your Lordships We are glad that you are safe. Exeunt Lictors, Paris, Latinus, Ãsopus. Lam. What times are these? To what is Rome falne? may we being alone Speake our thoughts freely of the Prince, and State, And not feare the informer. Rust. Noble Lamia, So dangerous the age is, and such bad acts Are practis'd euery where, we hardly sleepe Nay cannot dreame with safetie. All our actions Are cal'd in question, to be nobly borne Is now a crime; and to deserue too well Held Capitall treason. Sonnes accuse their Fathers, Fathers their sonnes; and but to winne a smile From one in grace in Court, our chastest Matrons Make ship wracke of their honours. To be vertuous Is to bee guilty. They are onely safe That know to sooth the Princes appetite, And serue his lusts. Sura. Tis true; and tis my wonder That two sonnes of so different a nature, Should spring from good Uespatian. We had a Titus, Stilde iustly the delight of all mankinde, Who did esteeme that day lost in his life In which some one or other tasted not. Of his magnificent bounties. One that had A readie teare when he was forc'd to signe The death of an offender. And so farre From pride, that he disdain'd not the conuerse Euen of the poorest Roman. Lam. Yet his brother Domitian, that now swayes the power of things, Is so inclin'd to bloud, that noe day passes In which some are not fastend to the hooke, Or throwne downe from the Gemonies. His freemen Scorne the Nobilitie, and he himselfe As if he were not made of flesh and bloud, Forgets he is a man. Rust. In his young yeeres He shew'd what he would be when growne to ripenes: His greatest pleasure was being a childe With a sharp pointed bodkin to kill flies, Whose roomes now men supply. For his escape. In the Vitellian warre he rais'd a Temple To Jupiter, and proudly plac'd his figure In the bosome of the God. And in his edicts He does not blush, or start to stile himselfe (As if the name of Emperour were base) Great Lord, and God Domitian. Sura. I haue letters He's on his way to Rome, and purposes To enter with all glorie. The flattering Senate Decrees him divine Honours, and to crosse it Were death with studied torments; for my part I will obey the time, it is in vaine To striue against the torrent Rust. Lets to the Curia And though vnwillingly grieue our suffrages Before we are compeld. Lam. And since we cannot With safetie vse the actiue, lets make vse of The passiue fortitude, with this assurance That the state sicke in him, the gods to friend, Though at the worst will now begin to mend, Exeunt. ScÃ¦na, 2. Enter Domitia, and Parthenius. Domit. To me this reuerence? Parth. I pay it Ladie As a debt due to her thats CÃ¦sars mistris. For vnderstand with ioy he that commands All that the Sunne giues warmth to, is your seruant. Be not amaz'd, but fit you to your fortunes. Thinke vpon state, and greatnesse, and the Honours That warre vpon Augusta, for that name Ere long comes to you: still you doubt your vassall, But when you haue read this letter, writ, and sign'd With his imperiall hand, you will be freed From feare, and jealousie and I beseech you, When all the beauties of the earth bowe to you, And Senators shall take it for an honour, As I doe now to kisse these happie feete; When euery smile you giue is a preferment, And you dispose of Prouinces to your creatures, Thinke on Parthenius. Domit. Rise. I am transported, And hardly dare beleeue what is assur'd here. The meanes, my good Parthenius, that wrought CÃ¦sar (Our God on earth) to cast an eye of fauour Vpon his humble handmaide! Parth. What but your beautie? When nature fram'd you for her master peece, As the pure abstract of all rare in woman, She had no other ends but to designe you To the most eminent place. I will not say (For it would smell of arrogance to insinuate The seruice I haue done you) with what zeale I oft haue made relation of your Vertues, Or how I haue sung your goodnesse or how CÃ¦sar Was fir'd with the relation of your storie, I am rewarded in the acte, and happie In that my proiect prosper'd. Domit. You are modest, And were it in my power I would to be thankefull. If that when I was mistris of my selfe, And in my way of youth, pure, and vntainted, The Emperour had vouchsaf'd to seeke my fauours, I had with ioy giuen vp my virgin fort At the first summons to his soft embraces: But I am now anothers, not mine owne. You know I haue a husband, for my honour I would not be his strumpet, and how lawe Can bee dispenc'd with to become his wife. To mee's a riddle. Parth. I can soone resolue it. When power puts in his Plea the lawes are silenc'd, The world confesses one Rome, and one CÃ¦sar, And as his rules is infinite, his pleasures Are vnconfin'd; this sillable his will Stands for a thousand reasons, Domit. But with safetie, Suppose I should consent, how can I doe it, My husband is a Senator of a temper, Not to be iested with. Enter Lamia. Parth. As if hee durst Be CÃ¦sars riuall. Heere he comes, with ease I will remoue this scruple. Lam. How! so priuate! Mine owne house made a brothell! Sir how durst you, Though gaurded with your power in Court, and greatnesse, Hould conference with my wife? as for your Minion I shall hereafter treate. Parth. You are rude, and sawcie, Nor know to whom you speake. Lam. This is fine ifaith! Parth. Your wife? but touch her, that respect forgotten That's due to her, whom mightiest CÃ¦sar fauours And thinke what 'tis to die. Not to loose time. She's CÃ¦sars choice. It is sufficient honor You were his taster in this heauenly nectar, But now must quit the office. Lam. This is rare. Cannot a man be master of his wife Because she's young, and faire, without a pattent. I in mine owne house am an Emperour, And will defend whats mine, where are my knaues? If such an insolence escape vnpunish'd. Parth. In your selfe Lamia. CÃ¦sar hath forgot To vse his power, and I his instrument, In whom though absent, his authoritie speakes, Haue lost my faculties. Stampes. Lam. The Guard! why am I Enter a Centurion with Souldiers. Design'd for death? Domit. As you desire my fauour Take not so rough a course. Parth. All your desires Are absolute commaunds. Yet giue me leaue To put the will of CÃ¦sar into acte. Heer's a bill of Diuorce betweene your Lordship, And this great Lady. If you refuse to signe it, And so as if you did it vncompell'd, Wonne to it by reasons that concerne your selfe, Her honour to vntainted. Here are Clearkes. Shall in your best bloud write it newe, till torture Compell you to performe it. Lam. Is this legall? Par. Monarchs that dare not doe vnlawfull things, Yet bare them out are Constables, not Kings Parth. Will you dispute? Lam. I know not what to vrge Against my selfe, but too much dotage on her Loue and obseruance. Parth. Set it vnder your hand That you are impotent, and cannot pay The duties of a husband, or that you are mad (Rather then want iust cause wee'l make you so) Dispatch, you know the danger els, deliuer it Nay on your knee. Madam you now are free And Mistris of your selfe. Lam. Can you Domitia Consent to this? Domit. 'Twould argue a base minde To liue a seruant, when I may commaund. I now am CÃ¦sars, and yet in respect I once was yours, when you come to the Pallace, (Prouided you deserue it in your seruice) You shall find me your good Mistris, waite me Parthenius And now farewell poore Lamia. Exeunt omnes preter Longinum. Lam. To the Gods I bend my knees, (for tyrannie hath banish'd Iustice from men) and as they would deserue Their Altars, and our vowes, humbly inuoke 'em That this my rauish'd wife may proue as fatall To proud Domitian, and her embraces Affoord him in the end as little ioy, As wanton Helen brought to him of Troy. Exit. ScÃ¦na, 3. Enter, Lictors, Arctinus, Fulcinius, Rusticus, Sura, Paris, Latinus, Ãsopus. Aret. Fathers conscript may this our meeting be Happie to CÃ¦sar and the common wealth. Lict. Silence. Aret. The purpose of this frequent Senate Is first to giue thankes to the Gods of Rome, That for the propagation of the Empire, Vouchsafe vs one to gouerne it like themselues: In height of courage, depth of vnderstanding, And all those vertues, and remarkeable graces, Which make a Prince most eminent, our Domitian Transcend's the ancient Romans. I can neuer Bring his praise to a period. What good man That is a friend to truth, dares make it doubtfull, That he hath Fabius slay'dnesse, and the courage Of bould Marcellus, to whom Hanibal gaue The stile of Target, and the Sword of Rome. But he has more, and euery touch more Roman As Pompey's dignitie, Augustus state, Antonies bountie, and great Iulius fortune. With Catoes resolution. I am lost In th'Ocean of his vertues. In a word All excellencies of good men in him meet, But no part of their vices. Rust. This is no flatterie! Sur. Take heed, you'l be obseru'd, Aret. 'Tis then most fit That we (as to the Father of our Countrie, Like thankefull sonnes, stand bound to pay true seruice For all those blessings that he showres vpon vs) Should not conniue, and see his gouernment, Deprau'd and scandaliz'd by meaner men That to his fauour, and indulgence owe Themselues and being. Par. Now he points at vs. Aret. Cite Paris the Tragedian. Par. Here. Aret. Stand forth. In thee, as being the chiefe of thy profession, I doe accuse the qualitie of treason, As libellers against the state and CÃ¦sar. Par. Meere accusations are not proofes my Lord, In what are we delinquents? Aret. You are they That search into the secrets of the time, And vnder fain'd names on the Stage present Actions not to be toucht at; and traduce Persons of rancke, and qualitie of both Sexes, And with Satiricall. and bitter iests Make euen the Senators ridiculous To the Plebeans. Par. If I free not my selfe, (And in my selfe the rest of my profession) From these false imputations, and proue That they make that a libell which the Poet Writ for a Comedie, so acted too, It is but Iustice that we vndergoe The heauiest censure. Aret. Are you on the Stage You talke so boldly? Par. The whole word being one This place is not exempted, and I am So confident in the iustice of our cause, That I could wish CÃ¦sar, in whose great name All Kings are comprehended sate as iudge, To heare our Plea, and then determine of vs. If to expresse a man sould to his lusts, Wasting the treasure of his time and Fortunes, In wanton dalliance, and to what sad end A wretch thats so giuen ouer does arriue at, Deterring carelesse youth, by his example, From such licentious courses; laying open The snares of baudes, and the consuming arts Of prodigall strumpets, can deserue reproofe, Why are not all your golden principles Writ downe by graue Philosophers to instruct vs To chuse faire Vertue for our guide, not pleasure, Condemne vnto the fire? Sura. There's spirit in this. Par. Or if desire of honour was the base On which the building of the Roman Empire Was rais'd vp to this height; if to inflame The noble youth with an ambitious heate T'indure the frosts of danger, nay of Death To be thought worthy the triumphall wreath By glorious vndertakings, may deserue Reward, or fauour, from the common wealth. Actors may put in for as large a share As all the sects of the Philosophers; They which could precepts (perhaps seldome reade) Deliver what an honourable thing The actiue vertue is. But does that fire The bloud, or swell the veines with emulation To be both good, and great, equall to that Which is presented on our Theaters? Let a good Actor in a loftie Sceane Show great Alcides honour'd in the sweate Of his twelue labours; or a bould Cancillus Forbidding Rome to be redeem'd with gold From the insulting Gaul's; or Scipio After his victories imposing Tribute On conquer'd Carthage. If done to the life, As if they saw their dangers, and their glories, And did partake with them in their rewardes, All that haue any sparke of Roman in them The slothfull artes layd by, contend to bee Like those they see presented. Rust. He ha's put The Consuls to their whisper, Par. But 'tis vrg'd That we corrupt youth, and traduce superiours: When doe we bring a vice vpon the Stage, That does goe off vnpunish'd? doe we teach By the successe of wicked vndertakings, Others to tread, in their forbidden steps? We show no arts of Lidian Pandarisme, Corinthian poysons, Persian flatteries, But mulcted so in the conclusion that Even those spectators that were so inclin'd, Go home chang'd men. And for traducing such That are aboue vs, publishing to the world Their secret crimes we are as innocent As such as are borne dumbe. When we present Ah heyre, that does conspire against the life Of his deare parent, numbring euery houre He liues as tedious to him, if there be Among the auditors one whose conscience tells him, He is of the same mould we cannot helpe it. Or bringing on the stage a loose adultresse, That does maintaine the ryatous expence Of him that seedes her greedie lust, yet suffers The lawfull pledges of a former bed To starue the while for hunger, if a Matron Howeuer great in fortune, birth, or titles, Guilty of such a foule vnnaturall sinne, Crie out tis writ by me, we cannot helpe it: Or when a couetous man's express'd, whose wealth Arithmatique cannot number, and whose Lordships A Falcon in one day cannot flie ouer. Yet he so sordid in his mind, so griping As not to affoord himselfe the necessaries To maintaine life, if a Patrician, (Though honourd with a Consulship) finde himselfe Touch'd to the quicke in this, we cannot helpe it. Or when we show a Iudge that is corrupt, And will giue vp his sentence as he fauours, The person, not the cause, sauing the guiltie If of his faction, and as oft condemning The innocent out of particular spleene, If any in this reuerend assemblie, Nay e'ne your selfe my Lord, that are the image Of absent CÃ¦sar feele something in your bosome That puts you in remembrance of things past, Or things intended tis not in vs to helpe it. I haue said, my Lord, and now as you finde cause Or censure vs, or free vs with applause. Lat. Well pleaded on my life I neuer saw him Act an Orators part before. Ãsop. We might haue giuen Ten double sees to Regulus, and yet Our cause deliuered worse. A shoute within, enter Parthenius. Aret. What shoute is that? Parth. CÃ¦sar our Lord married to conquest, is Returnd in triumph. Fulcin. Lets all hast to meete him. Aret. Breake vp the Court, we will reserue to him The Censure of this cause All. Long life to CÃ¦sar. Exeunt omnes. ScÃ¦na, 4. Enter Iulia, CÃ¦nis, Domitilla, Domitia. CÃ¦n. Stand backe the place is mine. Jul. Your's? am I not Great Titus daughter, and Domitians neece Dares any claime precedence? CÃ¦n. I was more The mistris of your father, and in his right Claime dutie from you. Iul. I confesse you were vsefull To please his appetite. Domit. To end the controuersie, For Ile haue no contending, Ile be bold To leade the way my selfe. Domitil. You Minion! Domit. Yes And all ere long shall kneele to catch my fauours. Iul, Whence springs this floud of greatnesse? Domit. You shall know To soone for your vexation, and perhaps Repent too late, and pine with enuie when You see whom CÃ¦sar fauours Iul. Obserue the sequel. Enter at one doore Captaines with Lawrels, Domitian, in his Triumphant Chariot, Parthenius, Paris, Latinus, Ãsopus met by Aretinus, Sura, Lamia, Rusticus, Fulcinius, and prisoners led by him. CÃ¦s. As we now touch the height of humane glorie, Riding in triumph to the Capitoll, Let these whom this victorious arme hath made The scorne of Fortune, and the slaues of Rome, Tast the extreames of miserie. Beare them off To the common prisons, and there let them proue How sharpe our axes are. Rust. A bloudie entrance! CÃ¦s. To tell you, you are happie in your Prince Were to distrust your loue, or my desert And either were distastefull. Or to boast How much, not by my Deputies, but my selfe, I haue enlargd the Empire; or what horrors The Souldier in our conduct hath broke through, Would better suite the mouth of Plautus bragart, Then the adored Monarch of the world. Sura. This is no boast. CÃ¦s. When I but name the Daci, And gray ey'd Germans whom I haue subdu'd, The Ghost of Iulius will looke pale with envie, And great Uespatians, and Titus triumph, (Truth must take place of Father and of Brother) Will be no more remembred. I am aboue All honours you can giue me. And the stile Of Lord, and God, which thankefull subiects giue me (Not my ambition) is deseru'd, Aret. At all parts CÅlestiall Sacrifice is fit for CÃ¦sar In our acknowledgement. CÃ¦s. Thankes Aretinus Still hold our fauour. Now; the God of warre, And famine, bloud, and death, Bellonas Pages Banish'd from Rome to Thrace in our good fortune. With iustice he may taste the fruits of peace, Whose sword hath plowd the ground, and reap'd the harvest Of your prosperitie. Nor can I thinke That there is one among you so vngratefull, Or such an enemie, to thriuing vertue, That can esteeme the iewell he holds deerest Too good for CÃ¦sars vse Sur. All we possesse. Lam. Our liberties. Fulcin. Our children. Parth. Wealth. Aret. And throates Fall willingly beneath his feete. Rust. Base flattery. What Roman could indure this? CÃ¦s. This cals on My loue to all, which spraeds it selfe among you. The beauties of the time! receiue the honour To kisse the hand, which rear'd vp thus, holds thunder To you 'tis an assurance of a calme. Julia my neece and CÃ¦nis the delight Of old Uespatian, Domitilla to A princesse of our bloud. Rust. Tis strange his pride Affords no greater courtesie to Ladies Of such high birth and rancke. Sur. Your wifes forgotten Lam. No shee will bee remembred feare it not She will bee grac'd and greas'd. CÃ¦s. But when I looke on Diuine Domitian, mee thinkes we should meete (The lesser gods applauding the encounter) As Iupiter the Giants lying dead On the PhlegrÃ¦an plaine imbrac't his Iuno Lamia 'tis your honour that she's mine. Lam. You are too great to be gainesaid. CÃ¦s. Let all That feare our frowne, or doe affect our fauour, Without examining the reason why, Salute her (by this kisse I make it good) With the title of Augusta. Domit. Still your seruant, All. Long liue Augusta great Domitians Empresse. CÃ¦s. Paris my hand. Par. The Gods still honour CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. The wars are ended, and our armes layd by We are for soft delights. Command the Poets To vse their choisest, and most rare inuention To entertaine the time, and be you carefull To giue it action, Wee'l prouide the people Pleasures of all kindes. My Domitia thinke not I flatter, though thus fond, On to the Capitoll Tis death to him that weares a sullen browe: This tis to be a Monarch when alone He can command all, but is aw'd by none Exeunt.

      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS, II. SCÃNA, 1. Enter Philargus, Parthenius. Philarg. My sonne to tutor me. Know your obedience And question not my will. Parth. Sir were I one Whom want compeld to wish a full possession Of what is yours. Or had I euer numbred Your yeeres, or thought you liu'd to long, with reason You then might nourish ill opinions of me. Or did the suite that I prefer to you Concerne my selfe, and aim'd not at your good You might denie, and I sit downe with patience, And after neuer presse you, Philarg. I' the name of Pluto What wouldst thou haue me doe? Parth. Right to your selfe, Or suffer me to doe it. Can you imagine This nastie hat, this tatterd cloke, rent shooe, This sordid linnen can become the master Of your faire fortunes? whose superfluous meanes (Though I were burthensome) could cloth you in The costliest Persian silkes, studded with iewels The spoyles of Prouinces, and euery day Fresh change of Tirian purple. Philarg. Out vpon thee, My monyes in my coffers melt to heare thee. Purple, hence Prodigall. Shall I make my Mercer Or Taylor my heyre, or see my Ieweller purchase? No, I hate pride. Parth. Yet decencie would doe well. Though for your outside you will not be alterd, Let me preuaile so farre yet, as to winne you Not to denie your bellie nourishment; Neither to thinke you haue feasted when 'tis cramm'd With mouldie barley bread, onions, and leekes, And the drinke of bondmen water. Philarg. Wouldst thou haue me Bee an Apicius, or a Lucullus, And ryot out my state in curious sawces? Wise nature with a little is contented, And following her, my guide, I cannot erre. Parth. But you destroy her in your want of care (I blush to see, and speake it) to maintaine her In perfect health and vigor, when you suffer (Frighted with the charge of Phisicke) Rheumes, Catars, The Scurfe, Ach in your bones to grow vpon you, And hasten on your fate with too much sparing. When a cheape Purge, a Vomit and good dyet May lengthen it, giue me but leaue to send The Emperors Doctor to you. Philarg. Ile be borne first Halfe rotten to the fire, that must consume me, His Pills, his Cordials, his Electuaries, His Sirrups Iulips, Bezerstone nor his Imagin'd Vnicornes horne comes in my bellie, My mouth shall be a draught first, 'Tis resolu'd. No; I'le not lessen my deare golden heape. Which euerie houre increasing does renew. My youth, and vigor, but if lessen'd, then, Then my poore hartstrings cracke. Let me enioy it, And brood ore't while I liue, it being my life, My soule, my all. But when I turne to dust, And part from what is more esteem'd by me Then all the Gods, Romes thousand Altars smoke to, Inherit thou my adoration of it, And like me serue my Idoll. Exit Philargus. Parth. What a strange torture Is Auarice to it selfe! what man that lookes on Such a penurious spectacle but must Know what the fable meant of Tantalus, Or the Asse whose backe is crack'd with curious viands Yet feedes on thistles. Some course I must take, To make my Father know what crueltie He vses on himselfe. Enter Paris. Par. Sir with your pardon, I make bould to enquire the Emperours pleasure, For, being by him commanded to attend Your fauour may instruct vs what's his will Shall be this night presented? Parth. My lou'd Paris, Without my intercession you well know You may make your owne approaches, since his eare To you is euer open. Par. I acknowledge His clemencie to my weakenesse, and if euer. I doe abuse it, lightning strike me dead, The grace he pleases to conferre vpon me (Without boast I may say so much) was neuer Impoly'd to wrong the innocent, or to incense His furie. Parth. 'Tis confess'd many men owe you For Prouinces they nere hop'd for; and their liues Forfeited to his anger, you being absent. I could say more. Par. You still are my good Patron. And lay it in my fortune to deserue it, You should perceiue the poorest of your clients To his best abilities thankefull. Parth. I belieue so. Met you my Father? Par. Yes Sir, with much griefe. To see him as he is. Can nothing worke him To be himselfe? Parth. O Paris 'tis a waight Sits heauie here, and could this right hands losse Remoue it, it should off but he is deafe To all perswasion. Par. Sir with your pardon, I'll offer my aduice! I once obseru'd In a Tragedie of ours, in which a murther Was acted to the life, a guiltie hearer Forc'd by the terror of a wounded conscience, To make discouerie of that, which torture Could not wring from him. Nor can it appeare Like an impossibilitie, but that Your Father looking on a couetous man Presented on the Stage as in a mirror May see his owne deformity, and loath it. Now could you but perswade the Emperour To see a Comedie we haue that's stilde The Cure of Avarice, and to command Your Father to be a spectator of it, He shall be so Anotamiz'd in the ScÃ¦ne, And see himselfe so personated; the basenes Of a selfe torturing miserable wretch Truely describ'd that I much hope the obiect Will worke compunction in him. Parth. There's your fee I ne're bought better counsaile. Be you in readines I will effect the rest. Par. Sir when you please Wee'l be prepar'd to enter. Sir the Emperour. Exit Paris. Enter CÃ¦sar, Aretinus, Guard. CÃ¦s. Repine at vs? Aret. Tis, more, or my informers That keepe strict watch vpon him are deceiu'd In their intelligence there is a list Of male contents, as Iunius Rusticus Palphurius, Sura, and this Ãlius, Lamia, That murmure at your triumphs as meere Pageants; And at their midnight meetings tax your iustice (For so I stile what they call tyrannie) For PÃ¦tus Thrasea's death, as if in him, Vertue her selfe were murther'd; nor forget they Agricola (who for his seruice done In the reducing Britanie to obedience) They dare affirme to be remou'd with poyson, And he compeld to write you a cohÃ¦yre With his daughter, that his testament might stand, Which else you had made void. Then your much loue To Julia your neece, censur'd as incest, And done in scorne of Titus your dead brother; But the divorce Lamia was forc'd to signe To her, you honour with Augusta's title, Being onely nam'd, they doe conclude there was A Lucrece once, a Collatine, and a Brutus, But nothing Roman left now, but in you The lust of Tarquin. CÃ¦s. Yes, His fire, and scorne Of such as thinke that our vnlimited power Can be confin'd, dares Lamia pretend An interest to that which I call mine? Or but remember, she was euer his That's now in our possession? fetch him hither. The Gard goe of. I'll giue him cause to wish he rather had Forgot his owne name then e're mention'd hers. Shall we be circumscrib'd? let such as cannot By force make good their actions, though wicked Conceale, excuse or qualifie their crimes: What our desires grant leaue, and priuiledge to Though contradicting all divine decrees, Or lawes confirm'd by Romulus, and Numa, Shall be held sacred. Aret. You should else take from The dignitie of CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. Am I master Of two and thirtie Legions, that awe All Nations of the triumphed world, Yet tremble at our frowne, yeeld an accompt Of whats our pleasure to a priuate man? Rome perish first, and Atlas shoulders shrinke, Heav'ns fabrique fall; the Sunne, the Moone, the Stars Loosing their light, and comfortable heate, Ere I confesse, that any fault of mine May be disputed. Aret. So you preserue your power As you should equall, and omnipotent heere, With Jupiters aboue. Parthenius kneeling whispers to CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. Thy suite is granted What ere it be Parthenius for thy seruice Done to Augusta. Onely so? a trifle. Command him hither. If the Comedie faile To cure him, I will minister something to him That shall instruct him to forget his gold, And thinke vpon himselfe. Parth. May it succeed well Since my intents are pious. Exit Parthenius. CÃ¦s. We are resolu'd What course to take, and therefore Aretinus Inquire no farther. Goe you to my Empresse, And say I doe entreate (for she rules him Whom all men else obey) she would vouchsafe The musicke of her voice, at yonder window, When I aduance my hand thus. I will blend Exit Aretinus. My crueltie with some scorne, or else tis lost. Reuenge, when it is vnexpected falling, With greater violence; and hate clothed in smiles, Strikes, and with horror dead the wretch that comes not Prepar'd to meete it. Our good Lamia welcome. Enter Lamia with the Guard. So much we owe you for a benefit With willingnes on your part conferd vpon vs, That 'tis our studie we that would not liue Ingag'd to any for a courtesie, How to returne it. Lam. 'Tis beneath your fate To be oblig'd that in your owne hand graspe The meanes to be magnificent. CÃ¦s. Well put off But yet it must not doe, the Empire, Lamia, Diuided equally can hold no waight, If ballanc'd with your guift in faire Domitia. You that could part with all delights at once, The magazine of rich pleasures being contain'd In her perfections, vncompell'd deliuer'd. As a Present fit for CÃ¦sar. In your eyes With teares of ioy, not sorrow, 'tis confirm'd You glory in your act. Lam. Derided too! Sir this is more. CÃ¦s. More then I can requite It is acknowledg'd Lamia. There's no drop Of melting nectar I tast from her lippe, But yeeldes a touch of immortalitie To the blest receiuer; euery grace and feature, Priz'd to the worth, bought at an easie rate; If purchas'd for a Consulship. Her discourse. So rauishing, and her action so attractiue, That I would part with all my other senses Prouided I might euer see, and heare her. The pleasures of her bed I dare not trust The windes or ayre with, for that would draw downe In enuie of my happinesse, a warre. From all the Gods vpon mee. Lam. Your compassion To me in your forbearing to insult On my calamitie which you make your sport, Would more appease those Gods you haue prouok'd Then all the blasphemous comparisons, You sing vnto her praise. CÃ¦s. I sing her praise? 'Tis farre from my ambition to hope it. Musicke aboue and a song. It being a debt she onely can lay downe, And no tongue else discharge. Harke. I thinke promped With my consent that you once more should heare her, She does begin. An vniuersall silence Dwell on this place. 'Tis death with lingring torments To all that dare disturbe her. Who can heare this The song ended CÃ¦sar goe on. And falls not downe and worships? in my fancie, Apollo being iudge on Latinos hill, Faire hayr'd Calliope on her iuorie Lute (But something short of this) sung Ceres prayses And grieslie Pluto's rape on Proserpine. The motion of the Spheares are out of time Her musicall notes but heard, Say Lamia, say, Is not her voice Angelicall? Lam. To your eare. But I alas am silent. CÃ¦s. Bee so euer, That without admiration canst heare her. Malice to my felicitie strikes thee dumbe, And in thy hope, or wish to repossesse What I loue more then Empire, I pronounce thee Guiltie of treasson. Off with his head. Doe you stare? By her, that is my Patronesse, Minerua, (Whose Statue I adore of all the Gods) If he but liue to make reply thy life The Guard lead off Lamia stopping his mouth. Shal answer it. My feares of him are freed now And he that liu'd to vpbraid me with my wrong For an offence he neuer could imagine In wantonnes remou'd. Descend my dearest. Plurality of husbands shall no more Breede doubts or iealousies in you. 'Tis dispatch'd And with as little trouble heere, as if I had kild a flye. Now you appeare and in Enter Domitia, vsherd in by Aretinus, her traine with all state borne vp by Julia, CÃ¦nis, and Domitilla. That glorie you deserue, and these that stoope To doe you seruice in the acte much honourd. Iulia forget that Titus was thy Father, CÃ¦nis and Domittilla ne're remmeber Sabinus, or Vespatian. To be slaues To her, is more true liberty then to liue Parthian or Asian Queenes. As lesser stars That waite on PhÃ¦be in her full of brightnes. Compar'd to her you are (thus I feare you) By CÃ¦sars side. Commanding these that once Were the adored glories of the time To witnes to the world they are your vassals At your feete to attend you. Domit. Tis your pleasure And not my pride. And yet when I consider That I am yours, all duties they can pay I doe receiue as circumstances due To her you please to honour. Enter Parthenius with Philargus. Parth. CÃ¦sars will Commaunds you hither, nor must you gaine-say it. Phil. Loose time to see an Enterlude? must I pay to For my vexation? Parth. Not in the Court, It is the Emperours charge. Phil. I shall endure My torment then the better. CÃ¦s. Can it bee This sordid thing Parthenius is thy Father? No actor can expresse him. I had held The fiction for impossible in the ScÃ¦ne, Had I not seene the substance. Sirrha sit still, And giue attention, if you but nod You sleepe for euer. Let them spare the Prologue, And all the Ceremonies proper to our selfe And come to the last act, there where the cure By the Doctor is made perfect. The swift minutes Seeme yeeres to me Domitia that diuorce thee From my embraces. My desires encreasing As they are satisfied all pleasure else Are tedious as dull sorrowes. Kisse me, againe: If I now wanted heate of youth, these fires In Priams veines would thaw his frozen bloud, Enabling him to get a second Hector For the defence of Troy. Domit. You are wanton? Pray you forbeare. Let me see the Play. CÃ¦s. Begin there. Enter Paris like a Doctor of Physicke, Ãsopies, Latinus brought forth a sleepe in a chayre, a key in his mouth. Ãsop. O master Doctor he is past recouerie A lethargie hath ceas'd him. And howeuer His sleepe resemble death his watchfull care To guard that treasure he dares make no vse of, Workes strongly in his soule. Par. What's that he holdes So fast betweene his teeth? Ãsop. The key that opens His iron chests cramn'd with accursed gold, Rustie with long imprisonment. There's no dutie In me his sonne, nor confidence in friends, That can perswade him to deliuer vp That to the trust of any. Philarg. He is the wiser We were fashion'd in one mould. Ãsop. He eates with it, And when deuotion calles him to the Temple Of Mammon, whom of all the Gods he kneeles to That held thus still, his orisons are payde; Or will he though, the wealth of Rome were pawn'd For the restoring of it for one short houre Be wonne to part with it. Philarg. Still, still my selfe. And if like me he loue his gold, no pawne Is good securitie. Par. I'll trie if I can force it. It will not be. His auaritious mind (Like men in riuers drown'd) makes him gripe fast To his last gaspe what he in life held dearest. And if that it were possible in nature Would carry it with him to the other world. Philarg. As I would doe to hell rather then leaue it. Ãsop. Is he not dead? Long since to all good actions Or to himselfe, or others, for which wise men Desire to liue. You may with safetie pinch him, Or vnder his nayles sticke needle, s yet he stirs not, Anxious feare to loose what his soule dotes on Renders his flesh insensible. We must vse Some meanes to rouse the sleeping faculties Of his mind, there lies the Lethargie. Take a Trumpet And blowe it into his eares, tis to noe purpose The roring noyse of thunder cannot wake him. And yet despaire not I haue one tricke yet left Ãsop. What is it? Par. I will cause a fearefull Dreame To steale into his fancie, and disturbe it With the horror it brings with it, and so free His bodyes Organs. Domit. 'Tis a cunning fellow, If he were indeed a Doctor as the play fayes, He should be sworne my seruant, gouerne my slumbers And minister to me waking. Par. If this faile A chest brought in. I'll giue him ore. So with all violence Rend ope this iron chest. For here is life lyes Bound vp in fetters, and in the defence Of what he values higher, 'twill returne And fill each veine and arterie. Lowder yet. 'Tis open, and alreadie he begins To stirre, marke with what trouble. Latinus stretches himselfe. Philarg. As you are CÃ¦sar Defend this honest thriftie man, they are theeues, And come to rob him. Parth. Peace the Emperour frownes. Par. So now powre out the bags vpon the Table, Romoue his iewels, and his bonds, againe. Ring a second golden peale, his eyes are open. He stares as he had seene Medusas head, And were turn'd marble. Once more. Lat. Murther, murther, They vs murther, murther. My sonne in the plot? Thou worse then paracide if it bee death To strike thy Fathers body, can all tortures, The furies in hell practise, be sufficient For thee that doest assassinate my soule? My gold! my bonds! my iewels! dost thou envie My glad possession of them for a day? Extinguishing the Taper of my life Consum'd vnto the snuffe? Par. Seem not to mind him. Lat. Haue I to leaue thee rich denied my selfe The ioyes of humaine being? Scrap'd and horded A masse of treasure, which had Solon seene The Lidian CrÃ¦fus had appear'd to him Poore as the begger Irus. And yet I Sollicitous to encrease it, when my intrayles Were clem'd with keeping a perpetuall fast, Was deafe to their loud windie cries, as fearing Should I disburse one peny to their vse, My heyre might curse me. And to saue expence In outward ornaments, I did expose My naked body to the Winters cold, And Summers scorching heate. Nay when diseases Grew thicke vpon me, and a little cost Had purchas'd my recouerie, I chose rather To haue my ashes clos'd vp in my vrne, By hasting on my fate, then to diminish The gold my prodigall sonne, while I am liuing, Carelessely scatters. Ãsop. Would you would dispatch and die once. Your Ghost should feele in hell, that is my slaue Which was your master. Philarg. Out vpon thee varlet. Par. And what then followes al your carke, and caring, And selfe affliction when your staru'd truncke is Turn'd to forgotten dust? This hopefull youth Vrines vpon your monument. Ne're remembring How much for him you suffer'd. And then tells To the companions of his lusts, and ryots, The hell you did indure on earth to leaue him Large meanes to be an Epicure; and to feast His senses all at once, a happines You neuer granted to your selfe. Your gold then (Got with vexation, and preseru'd with trouble) Maintaines the publicke stewes, pandars, and ruffians That quaffe damnations to your memorie, For liuing so long here. Lat. 'Twill be so, I see it. O that I could redeeme the time that's past I would liue, and die like my selfe; and make true vse Of what my industrie purchas'd. Par. Couetous men Hauing one foote in the graue lament so euer. But grant that I by Art could yet recouer Your desperate sicknes, lengthen out your life A dozen of yeeres, as I restore your body To perfect health, will you with care endeuour To rectifie your mind Lat. I should so liue then As neither my heyre should haue iust cause to thinke I liu'd too long for being close handed to him, Or cruell to my selfe. Par. Haue your desires PhÃ¦bus assisting, mee I will repayre The ruin'd building of your health, and thinke not You haue a sonne that hates you; the truth is This meanes with his consent I practis'd on you, To this good end, it being a deuice In you to shew the Cure of Avarice. Exeunt Paris, Latinus, Ãsopus. Phil. An old foole to be guld thus ! had he died As I resolue to doe, not to be alter'd, It had gone off twanging. CÃ¦s. How approue you sweetest, Of the matter, and the Actors? Domit. For the subiect I like it not, it was filch'd out of Horace, Nay I haue read the Poets but the fellow That play'd the Doctor did it well by Venus; He had a tunable tongue and neate deliuery, And yet in my opinion he would performe A louers part much better. Prethee CÃ¦sar For I grow wearie let vs see to morrow Jplus and Anaxerete. CÃ¦s. Any thing For thy delight Domitia. To your rest Till I come to disquiet you. Wayte vpon her. There is a busines that I must dispatch And I will straight be with you. Exeunt Aretinus, DomitiÃ¦, Iulia, CÃ¦nis, Domitilla. Parth. Now my dread Sir Endeuour to preuayle. CÃ¦s. One way or other. Wee'l cure him neuer doubt it. Now Philargus Thou wretched thing, hast thou seene thy sordid basenesse? And but obseru'd what a contemptible creature A couetous miser is? dost thou in thy selfe Feele true compunction! with a resolution To be a new man? Philarg. This craz'd bodies CÃ¦sars, But for my minde. CÃ¦s. Trifle not with my anger. Canst thou make good vse of what was now presented? And imitate in thy suddaine change of life, The miserable rich man, that expres'd What thou art to the life. Philarg. Pray you giue me leaue To dye as I haue liu'd. I must not part with My gold, it is my life. I am past cure. CÃ¦s. No; by Minerua thou shalt neuer more Feele the least touch of auarice. Take him hence And hang him instantly. If there be gold in hell Inioy it, thine here and thy life together Is forfeited. Philarg. Was I sent for to this purpose? Parth. Mercie for all my seruice, CÃ¦sar mercie CÃ¦s. Should Ioue pleade for him. 'Tis resolu'd he dyes, And he that speakes one sillable to disswade me, And therefore tempt me not. It is but iustice. Since such as wilfully, will hourely dye, Must tax themselues, and not my crueltie. Exeunt omnes. The end of the second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS, III. SCÃNA, 1. Enter Iulia, Domitilla, Stephanos. Iul. No Domitilla, if you but compare What I haue suffer'd with your iniuries, (Though great ones I confesse) they will appeare Like molehils to Olimpus. Domitil. You are tender Of your owne wounds, which makes you loose the feeling And sense of mine. The incest he committed With you, and publikely profes'd in scorne Of what the world durst censure may admit Some weake defence, as being borne headlong to it, But in a manly way to enioy your beauties. Besides wonne by his periuries that he would Salute you with the title of Angusta, Your faint deniall show'd a full consent, And grant to his temptations. But poore I That would not yeeld, but was with violence forc'd To serue his lusts, and in a kinde Tiberius At CaprÃ¦ neuer practis'd, haue not heere One conscious touch to rise vp my accuser I in my will being innocent. Steph. Pardon mee Great Princesses, though I presume to tell you Wasting your time in childish lamentations, You doe degenerate from the bloud; you spring from: For there is something more in Rome expected From Titus daughter, and his vncles heyre, Then womanish complaints after such wrongs Which mercie cannot pardon. But you'l say Your hands are weake, and should you but attempt A iust reuenge on this inhumaine monster. This prodegie of mankind bloudie Domitian, Hath readie words at his command aswell As Islands to confine you to remoue. His doubts, and feares, did he but entertaine The least suspition you contriu'd or plotted Against his person. Iul. 'Tis true Stephanos. The legions that sacred Hierusalem Vnder my Father Titus are sworne his, And I no more remembred. Domit. And to loose Our selues by building on impossible hopes, Were desperate madnes. Steph. You conclude too fast. One single arme whose master does contemne His owne life holds a full command ore his, Spite of his guards. I was your bondman Ladie, And you my gracious patronesse; my wealth, And libertie your guift, and though no souldier, To whom or custome, or example makes Grimme death appeare lesse terrible, I dare dye To doe you seruice in a faire reuenge, And it will better suite your births and honours To fall at once, then to liue euer slaues To his proud Empresse that insults vpon Your patient sufferings. Say but you goe on, And I will retch his heart, or perish in The noble vndertaking. Domit. Your free offer Confirmes your thankefulnesse, which I acknowledge A satisfaction for a greater debt Then what you stand ingag'd for: but I must not Vpon vncertaine grounds hazard so gratefull, And good a seruant. The mortall powers Protect a Prince though sould to impious acts, And seeme to slumber till his roaring crimes Awake their iustice: but then looking downe And with impartiall eyes, on his contempt Of all religion, and mortall goodnesse, They in their secrets iudgements doe determine To leaue him to his wickednesse, which sinckes him When he is most secure. Jul. His crueltie Increasing dayly of necessitie Must render him as odious to his souldiers, Familiar friends, and freemen, as it hath done Alreadie to the Senate; then forsaken Of his supporters, and growne terrible Eu'n to himselfe, and her, he now so dotes on, We may put into act, what now with safetie We cannot whisper, Steph. I am still prepar'd To execute when you please to command mee: Since I am confident he deserues much more That vindicates his countrie from a tyrannie, Then he that saues a citizen. Iul. O heere's CÃ¦nis. Enter CÃ¦nis. Domitil. Whence come you? CÃ¦n. From the Empresse who seemes mou'd In that you waite no better. Her prides growne To such a height that shee disdaines the service Of her owne women; and esteemes her selfe Neglected? when the Princesses of the bloud On everie course imployment, are not readie To stoope to her commands. Domitil. Where is her greatnes? CÃ¦n. Where you would little thinke she could descend To grace the roome or persons. Iul. Speake; where is she? CÃ¦n. Among the Players, where all state layd by, She does enquire who acts this part, who that, And in what habits? blames the tire-women For want of curious dressings; and so taken She is with Paris the Tragedians shape That is to act a Louer, I thought once She would haue courted him. Domitil. In the meane time How spends the Emperour his houres? CÃ¦n. As euer He hath done heretofore in being cruell To innocent men, whose vertues he calles crimes. And but this morning if't be possible He hath out-gone himselfe, hauing condemn'd At Aretinus his informers suite, Palphurius Sura, and good Junius Rusticus, Men of the best repute in Rome for their Integritie of life; no fault obiected But that they did lament his cruell sentence On PÃ¦tus Thraseas the Philosopher Their Patron and instructer. Steph. Can Ioue see this And hold his thunder. Domitil. Nero and Caligula Commanded onely mischiefes, but our CÃ¦sar Delights to see 'em. Jul. What we cannot helpe, We may deplore with silence. CÃ¦n. We are call'd for By our proud mistresse. Domit. We a while must suffer. Steph. It is true fortitude to stand firme against All shocks of fate, when cowards faint and dye In feare to suffer more calamitie. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na, 2. Enter CÃ¦sar, Parthenius. CÃ¦s. They are then in fetters. Parth. Yes Sir. But CÃ¦s. But? What? I'll haue thy thoughts. Deliuer them. Parth. I shall Sir. But still submitting to your God-like pleasure, Which cannot be instructed? CÃ¦s. To the point. Parth. Nor let your sacred Maiestie belieue Your vassall, that with drie eyes look'd vpon His Father drag'd to death by your command, Can pitty these, that durst presume to censure What you decreed. CÃ¦s. Well. Forward. Parth. 'Tis my zeale Still to preserue your clemencie admi'rd Temper'd with iustice, that emboldens me To offer my aduice. Alas I know Sir These Bookemen, Rusticus, and Palphurius Sura, Deserue all tortures. Yet in my opinion, They being popular Senators, and cried vp With loud applauses of the multitude, For foolish honestie, and beggerly vertue, T'would rellish more of pollicie to haue them Made away in priuate, with what exquisite torments You please it skils not, then to haue them drawne To the degrees in publike; for 'tis doubted That the sad obiect may beget compassion In the giddie rout, and cause some sudaine vprore That may disturbe you. CÃ¦s. Hence pale spirited coward Can we descend so farre beneath our selfe As, or to court, the peoples loue, or feare Their worst of hate? Can they that are as dust Before the whirle winde of our will and power, Adde any moment to vs? Or thou thinke If there are Gods aboue, or Goddesses, (But wise Minerua that's mine owne and sure) That they haue vacant houres to take into Their serious protection, or care, This many headed monster? mankind liues In few, as potent Monarchs, and their Peers; And all those glorious constellations That doe adorne the firmament, appointed Like groomes with their bright influence to attend The actions of Kings, and Emperours, They being the greater wheeles that moue the lesse. Bring forth those condemn'd wretches; let me see One man so lost, as but to pittie 'em And though there lay a million of soules Imprison'd in his flesh, my Hangmens hookes Should rend it off and giue 'em libertie. CÃ¦sar hath said it. Exit Parthenius. Enter Parthenius, Aretinus, and the Guard, Hangmen dragging in Iunius, Rusticus, and Palphurius Sura, bound backe to backe: Aret. 'Tis great CÃ¦sars pleasure That with fix'd eyes you carefully obserue The peoples lookes. Charge vpon any man That with a sigh, or murmure does expresse A seeming sorrow for these traytors deaths. You know his will, performe it. CÃ¦s. A good bloud-hound, And fit for my imployments. Sur. Giue vs leaue To dye fell tyrant. Rust. For beyond our bodies Thou hast no power. CÃ¦s. Yes I'll afflict your soules. And force them groaning to the Stigian lake Prepar'd for such to howle in, that blaspheame The power of Princes, that are Gods on earth; Tremble to thinke how terrible the dreame is After this sleepe of death. Rust. To guiltie men It may bring terror, not to vs, that know What 'tis to dye, well taught by his example For whom we suffer. In my thought I see The substance of that pure vntainted soule, Of Thraseas our master made a starre, That with melodious harmonie invites vs (Leauing this dunghill Rome, made hell by thee,) To trace his heauenly steps, and fill a Spheare Aboue yon Chrystall Canopie. CÃ¦s. Doe inuoke him With all the aydes his sanctitie of life Haue wonne on the rewarders of his vertue, They shall not saue you Dogs doe you grinne? torment 'em. So take a leafe of Seneca now and proue If it can render you insensible Of that which but begins here. Now an oyle The Hangmen torment 'em they still smiling. Drawne from the Stoicks frozen principles Predominant ouer fire were vsefull for you. Againe, againe. You trifle. Not a groane, Is my rage lost? What cursed charmes defend 'em! Search deeper villaines. Who lookes pale? or thinkes That I am cruell? Aret. Ouer mercifull. 'Tis all your weakenesse Sir. Parth. I dare not show A signe of sorrow, yet my synnewes shrinke The spectacle is so horrid. Aside. CÃ¦s. I was neuer O'recome till now. For my sake rore a little, And show you are corporeall, and not turn'd Aeriall spirits. Will it not do. By Pallas It is vnkindly done to mocke his furie Whom the world stiles omnipotent. I am tortur'd In their want of feeling torments. Marius storie That does report him to haue sate vnmou'd When cunning Chirurgions rip'd his arteries, And veines, to cure his goute compar'd to this Deserues not to bee nam'd. Are they not dead? If so, wee wash an Ãthiope. Sur. No, wee liue. Rust. Liue to deride thee, our calme patience treading Vpon the necke of tyrannie. That securely, (As t'were a gentle slumber,) we indure Thy hangmens studied tortures, is a debt Wee owe to graue Philosophie, that instruct's vs The flesh is but the clothing of the soule Which growing out of fashion though it bee Cast of, or rent, or torne, like ours, 'tis then Being it selfe diuine, in her best luster. But vnto such as thou, that haue no hopes Beyond the present, euerie little scar; The want of rest; excesse of heare or, cold That does informe them, onely they are mortall, Pierce through, and through them. CÃ¦s. We will heare no more, Rust. This onely, and I giue thee warning of it. Though it is in thy will to grinde this earth, As small as Atomes, they throwne in the Sea to. They shall seeme recollected to thy sense, And when the sandie building of thy greatnes, Shall with its owne weight totter; looke to see me As I was yesterday, in my perfect shape, For I'll appeare in horror. CÃ¦s. By my shaking I am the guiltie man, and not the Iudge. Drag from my sight, these cursed ominous wizards, That as they are now like to double fac'd Janus Which way soe're I looke, are furies to me. Away with 'em. First show them death, then leaue Exeunt Hangmen with Rusticus and Sura. No memory of their ashes I'll mocke fate. Shall words fright him, victorious armies circle? No, no, the feuer does begin to leaue me. Enter Domitia, Julia, CÃ¦nis. Stephanos following. Of were it deadly, from this liuing fountaine I could renue the vigor of my youth, And be a second Verbius. O my glory! My life! command! my all! Embracing and kissing mutually. Domit. As you to me are. I heard you were sad; I haue prepar'd you sport Will banish melancholie, Sirrha, CÃ¦sar, (I hugge my selfe for't) I haue beene instructing The Players how to act, and to cut off All tedious impertinencie, haue contracted The Tragedie, into one continued Sceane. I haue the art of't, and am taken more With my abilitie that way, then all knowledge I haue but of thy loue. CÃ¦s. Thou art still thy selfe, The sweetest, wittiest. Domit. When wee are a bed I'll thanke your good opinion. Thou shalt see Such an Iphis of thy Paris, and to humble The pride of Domitilla that neglects mee (How e're she is your cousin.) I haue forc'd her To play the part of Anaxerete. You are not offended with it? CÃ¦s. Any thing That does content thee yeilds delight to mee. My faculties, and powers are thine. Domit. I thanke you Prethee lets take our places. Bid 'em enter After a short flourish, enter Paris as Jphis. Without more circumstance, how doe you like That shape? me thinkes it is most sutable To the aspect of a despairing louer. The seeming late falne, counterfeited teares That hang vpon his cheekes, was my deuice. CÃ¦s. And all was excellent. Domit. Now heare him speake. Par. That she is faire (and that an Epethite To soule to expresse her) or descended nobly, Or rich, or fortunate, and certaine truthes In which poore Iphis glories. But that these Perfections, in no other Virgin found, Abus'd, should nourish crueltie, and pride, In the diuinest Anaxarete, Is, to my loue-sicke languishing soule, a riddle, And with more difficultie to be dissolu'd, Then that, the monster Sphinx from the steepie rocke Offer'd to Oedipus. Imperious loue, As at thy euer flaming Altars Iphis Thy neuer tyred votarie hath presented With scalding teares whose Hecatombes of sighes, Preferring thy power, and thy Paphian mothers, Before the thunderers, Neptunes, or Pluto's (That after Saturne did diuide the world And had the sway of things) yet were compell'd By thy vneuitable shafts to yeeld And fight vnder thy ensignes, be auspicious To this last tryall of my sacrifice Of loue, and seruice. Domit. Do's he not act it rarely? Obserue with what a feeling he deliuers His orisons to Cupid; I am rap'd with't. Par. And from thy neuer emptied quiuer take A golden arrow, to transfix her heart And force her loue like me, or cure my wound With a leaden one, that may beget in me Hate and forgetfulnesse, of what's now my Idoll. But I call backe my prayer, I haue blaspheam'd In my rash wish. 'Tis I that am vnworthy, But she all merit, and may in iustice challenge From the assurance of her excellencies Not loue, but adoration. Yet beare witnesse All knowing powers, I bring along with me As faithfull aduocates to make intercession A loyall heart, with pure, and holy flames With the foule fires of lust neuer polluted. And as I touch her threshold (which with teares My limbes benumb'd with cold, I oft haue wash'd) With my glad lips I kisse this earth growne proud With frequent fauours from her delicate feete. Domit. By CÃ¦sars life he weepes. And I forbeare Hardly to keepe him companie. Par. Blest ground thy pardon If I prophane it with forbidden steps. I must presume to knocke, and yet attempt it With such a trembling reuerence as if My hands held vp, for expiation To the incensed Gods to spare a kingdome. Within there, hoe? something divine come forth To a distressed mortall. Enter Latinus as a Porter. Lat. Ha! Who knockes there? Domit. What a churlish looke this knaue has Lat. Is't you Sirrha? Are you come to pule and whine? avaunt, and quickly. Dogwhips shall driue you hence else. Domit. Churlish deuill? But that I should disturbe the Sceane, as I liue I would teare his eyes out. CÃ¦s. 'Tis in iest Domitia, Domit. I doe not like such iesting, if he were not A flintie hearted slaue, he could not vse One of his forme so harshly. How the toade swells At the others sweete humilitie! CÃ¦s. 'Tis his part Let 'em proceed. Domit. A Rogues part, will ne're leaue him! Par. As you haue gentle Sir, the happinesse (When yon please) to behold the figure of The master peice of nature, limn'd to the life, In more then humane Anaxerete, Scorne not your seruant, that with suppliant hands Takes hold vpon your knees, coniuring you As you are a man, and did not sucke the milke Of Wolues, and Tigres, or a mother of A tougher temper, vse some meanes these eyes Before they are wept out, may see your Ladie. Will you be gracious Sir? Lat. Though I loose my place for't I can hold out no longer. Domit. Now hee melts There is some little hope hee may die honest Lat. Madam. Enter Domitilla for Anaxerete. Domit. Who calls? what obiect haue we heere? Domit. Your cousin keepes her proud state still I thinke I haue fitted her for a part. Domit. Did I not charge thee I ne're might see this thing more? Par. I am indeed What thing you please, a Worme that you may tread on, Lower I cannot fall to shew my duty, Till your disdaine hath dig'd a graue to couer This bodie with forgotten dust, and when I know your sentence, cruellest of women) I'll by a willing death remoue the obiect That is an eyesore to you. Domit. Wretch thou darst not. That were the last, and greatest seruice to mee Thy doting loue could boast of. What dull foole But thou could nourish any flattering hope One of my height, in youth, in birth and fortune Could e're defend to looke vpon thy lownesse? Much lesse consent to make my Lord of one I would not accept, though offre'd for my slaue, My thoughts stoope not so lowe. Domit. There's her true nature No personated scorne. Domit. I wrong my worth Or to exchange a syllable, or looke, With one so farre beneath me. Par. Yet take heed, Take heed of pride, and curiouslie consider How brittle the foundation is, on which You labour to aduance it. Niobe Proud of her numerous issue durst contemne Latonas double burthen but what follow'd? She was left a childlesse mother, and mourn'd to marble. The beautie you o're-prize so, time, or sicknes Can change to loth'd deformitie, Your wealth The prey of theeues; Queene Heccuba Troy fir'd Vlisses bond-woman. But the loue I bring you Nor time, nor sicknesse, violent theeues, nor fate Can rauish from you. Domit. Could the Oracle Giue better counsaile. Par. Say will you relent yet? Reuoking your decree that I should dye? Or shall I doe what you command? resolue I am impatient of delay. Domit. Dispatch then I shall looke on your Tragedie vnmou'd, Peraduenture laugh at it, for it will proue A Comedie to me. Domit. O diuell! diuell! Par. Then thus I take my last leaue. All the curses Of louers fall vpon you; and hereafter When any man like me contemn'd, shall studie In the anguish of his soule to giue a name To a scornfull cruell mistresse, let him onely Say this most bloudie woman is to me, As Anaxerete was to wretched Iphis. Now feast your tyrannous mind, and glorie in The ruines you haue made: for Hymens bands That should haue made vs one, this fatall halter For euer shall diuorce vs; at your gate As a trophee of your pride, and my affliction, I'll presently hang my selfe. Domit. Not for the world. Restraine him as you loue your liues. CÃ¦s. Why are you Transported thus Domitia? 'tis a play, Or grant it serious, it at no part merits. This passion in you. Par. I nere purpos'd Madam To do the deed in earnest, though I bowe To your care, and tendernesse of me. Domit. Let me Sir, Intreate your pardon, what I saw presented Carried me beyond my selfe. CÃ¦s. To your place againe And see what followes. Domit. No I am familiar With the conclusion, besides vpon the sudaine I feele my selfe much indispos'd. CÃ¦s. To bed then I'll be thy Doctor. Areo. There is something more In this then passion, which I must find out, Or my intelligence freezes. Domit. Come to me Paris To morrow for your reward Steph. Patronesse heare mee Will you not call for your share? sit downe with this, And the next action like a Gaditane strumpet I shall looke to see you tumble. Domit. Prethee be patient. I that haue sufferd greater wrongs beare this And that till my reuenge my comfort is. Exeunt. The end of the third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS, IIII. SCÃNA, 1. Enter Parthenius, Iulia, Domitilla, CÃ¦nis. Parth. Why 'tis impossible Paris? Iul. You obseru'd not (As it appeares) the violence of her passion, When personating Iphis, he pretended (For your contempt faire Anaxerete) To hang himselfe. Parth. Yes, yes, I noted that; But neuer could imagine it could worke her To such a strange intemperance of affection, As to dote on him. Domit. By my hopes I thinke not That she respects though all heere saw, and mark'd it Presuming she can mould the Emperours will Into what forme she likes, though we, and all Th'informers of the world conspir'd to crosse it. CÃ¦n. Then with what eagernesse this morning vrging The want of health, and rest, she did intreate CÃ¦sar to leaue her. Domit. Who no sooner absent But she calls Dwarfe (so in her scorne she stiles me) Put on my pantofies, fetch pen, and paper I am to write, and with distracted lookes, In her smocke, impatient of so short delay As but to haue a mantle throwne vpon her, She seal'd I know not what, but 'twas indors'd To my lou'd Paris. Jul. Adde to this I heard her Say, when a page receiu'd it; let him waite me And carefully in the walke, cal'd our retreate, Where CÃ¦sar in his feare to giue offence, Vnsent for neuer enters. Parth. This being certaine (For these are more then iealous suppositions) Why doe not you that are so neere in bloud Discouer it? Domit. Alas you know wee dare not. 'Twill be receaued for a malicious practise To free vs from that slauerie, which her pirde Imposes on vs. But if you would please To breake the ice on paine to be suncke euer We would auerre it. Parth. I would second you, But that I am commanded with all speede To fetch in Ascletario, the ChaldÃ¦an. Who in his absence is condemn'd of treason For calculating the natiuitie Of CÃ¦sar, with all confidence fore-telling In euerie circumstance when he shall die A violent death. Yet if you could approue Of my directions I would haue you speake As much to Aretinus, as you haue To me deliuer'd. He in his owne nature Being a spie, on weaker grounds no doubt Will vndertake it, not for goodnesse sake (With which he neuer yet held correspondence) But to endea're his vigilant obseruings Of what concernes the Emperour, and a little To triumph in the ruines of this Paris Enter Aretinas. That cros'd him the ruines in the Senate house. Here he comes His nose held vp, he hath something in the winde, Or I much erre alreadie. My designes Command me hence great Ladies, but I leaue My wishes with you. Exit Parthenius. Aret. Haue I caught your greatnes In the trap my proud Augusta? Domit. What is't raps him? Aret. And my fine Roman Actor? is't euen so? No courser dish to take your wanton palate Saue that which but the Emperour none durst tast off? T'is very well. I needs must glory in This rare discouerie, but the rewards Of my intelligence, bid me thinke even now, By an edict from CÃ¦sar I haue power, To tread vpon the necke of slauish Rowe, Disposing offices, and Prouinces, To my kinsmen, friends and clients. Domit. This is more Then vsuall with him, Jul. Aretinus? Aret. How? No more respect and reuerence tender'd to mee But Aretinus! 'tis confess'd that title When you were Princesses, and commanded all Had beene a fauour; but being as you are Vassals to a proud woman, the worst bondage, You stand oblig'd with as much adoration To entertaine him, that comes arm'd with strength, To breake your fetters, as tand gallie-slaues Pay such as doe redeeme them from the oare I come not to intrap you, But aloud Pronounce that you are manumiz'd, and to make Your libertie sweeter, you shall see her fall, (This Empresse, this Domitia, what you will) That triumph'd in your miseries. Domit. Were, you serious To proue your accusation, I could lend Some helpe. CÃ¦n. And I. Jul. And I. Aret. No atome to mee. My eyes, and eares are euery where, I know all, To the line and action in the play that tooke her; Her quicke dissimulation to excuse Her being transported, with her morning passion; I brib'd the boy that did conuey the letter, And hauing perus'd it, made it vp againe: Your griefes, and angers, are to me familiar; That Paris is brought to her, and how farre, He shall be tempted. Domit. This is aboue wonder. Aret. My gold can worke much stranger miracles Then to corrupt poore waiters. Heere ioyne with me 'Tis a complaint to CÃ¦sar. This is that Shall ruine her, and raise you. Haue you set your hands To the accusation. Iul. And will iustifie What we haue subscrib'd to. CÃ¦n. And with vehemencie. Domit. I will deliuer it. Aret. Leaue the rest to me then Enter CÃ¦sar with his Guard. CÃ¦s. Let our Lieutenants bring vs victory, While we enioy the fruites of peace at home, And being secur'd from our intestiue foes, Far worse then forreine enemies, doubts, and feares, Though all the skie were hung with blazing meteors, Which fond Astrologers giue out to be Assur'd presages of the change of Empires, And death of Monarchs, wee vndaunted yet Guarded with our owne thunder, bid defiance, To them, and fate, we being too strongly arm'd For them to wound vs. Aret. CÃ¦sar. Jul. As thou art More then a man. CÃ¦n. Let not thy passions bee Rebellious to thy reason. The Petition deliuer'd. Domit. But receiue This tryall of your constancie, as vnmou'd As you goe to, or from the Capitoll, Thankes giuen to Ioue for triumphs? CÃ¦s. Ha! Domit. Vouchsafe A while to stay the lightning of your eyes. Poore mortalls dare not looke on. Aret. There's no veine Of yours, that rises high with rage, but is An earthquake to vs. Domit. And if not kept clos'd With more then humaine patience in a moment Will swallow vs to the center. CÃ¦n. Not that we Repine to serue her, are we her accusers. Iul. But that she's falne so low. Aret. Which on sure proofes VVe can make good. Domitil. And Show she is vnworthie Of the least sparke of that diuiner fire You haue confer'd vpon her. CÃ¦s. I stand doubtfull. And vnresolu'd what to determine of you. In this malicious violence you haue offer'd To the Altar of her truth, and purenesse to me, You haue but fruitlesly labour'd to sullye A white robe of perfection, blackmouth'd enuie Could belch no spot on. But I will put off The deitie, you labour to take from me, And argue out of probabilities with you As if I weare a man. Can I beleeue That she, that borrowes all her light from me, And knowes to vse it, would betray her darknesse To your intelligence, and make that apparent, Which by her perturbations in a play VVas yesterday but doubted and find none, But you that are her slaues, and therefore hate her VVhose aydes she might imploy to make way for her? Or Aretinus whom long since she knew To be the Cabinet counsailor, nay the key Of CÃ¦sars secrets? could her beauty raise her To this vnequald height to make her fall The more remarkable? or must my desires To her, and wrongs to Lamia be reuengd By her, and on herselfe that drewe on both? Or she leaue our imperiall bed to court A publicke actor? Aret. who dares contradict These more then humain reasons, that haue power To cloth base guilt, in the most glorious shape Of innocence? Domit. To wel she knew the strength, And eloquence of her patron to defend her, And thereupon presuming fell securely, Not fearing an accuser, nor the truth. Produc'd against her, which your loue and fauour Will ne're discerne from falshood. CÃ¦s. I'll not heere A syllable more that may inuite a change In my opinion of her. You haue rais'd, A fiercer war within me by this fable, (Though with your lines you vowe to make it storie) Then if, and at one instant all my legions Reuolted from me, and came arm'd against me. Heere in this paper are the swords predestin'd For my destruction; heere the fatall stars That threaten more then ruine; this the deaths head That does assure me, if she can proue false That I am mortall, which a sudaine feauer Would prompt me to beleeue, and fayntly yeeld to. But now in my full confidence what she suffers, In that, from any witnesse but my selfe, I nourish a suspition she's vntrue, My toughnes returnes to me. Lead on Monsters, And by the forfeit of your liues confirme She is all excellence, as you all basenesse, Or let mankinde for her fall, boldly sweare There are no chast wiues now, nor euer were. Exeunt omnes. ScÃ¦na, 2. Enter Domitia, Paris, Seruants. Domit. Say we command, that none presume to dare On forfeit of our fauour, that is life, Out of a sawcie curiousnesse to stand Within the distance of their eyes, or eares, Till we please to be waited on. And sirrha Exeunt seruants. Howe're you are excepted, let it not Beget in you an arrogant opinion 'Tis done to grace you. Par. With my humblest seruice I but obey your summons, and should blush else To be so neare you. Domit. 'Twould become you rather To feare, the greatnesse of the grace vouchsaf'd you May ouerwhelme you, and 'twill doe no lesse. If when you are rewarded, in your cups You boast this priuacie. Par. That were mightiest Empresse To play with lightning. Domit. You conceiue it right. The meanes to kill, or saue, is not alone In CÃ¦sar circumscrib'd, for if incens'd We haue our thunder to, that strikes as deadly. Par. 'Twould ill become the lownesse of my fortune To question what you can doe, but withall Humilitie to attend what is your will, And then to serue it. Domit. And would not a secret (Suppose we should commit it to your trust) Scald you to keepe it? Par. Though it rag'd within me Till I turn'd cyndars, it should ne're haue vent. To be an age a dying, and with torture Onely to be thought worthy of your counsaile, Or actuate what you command to me A wretched obscure thing, not worth your knowledge, Were a perpetuall happinesse. Domit. We could wish That we could credit thee, and cannot find In reason but that thou whom oft I haue seene To personate a Gentleman, noble, wise, Faithfull, and gainsome, and what vertues else The Poet pleases to adorne you with (But that as vessels still pertake the odour Of the sweete pretious liquors they contain'd) Thou must be reallie in some degree The thing thou dost present. Nay doe not tremble, We seriouslie beleeue it, and presume Our Paris is the volume in which all Those excellent guifts the Stage hath seene him grac'd with Are curiouslie bound vp. Par. The argument Is the same great Augusta, that I acting, A foole, a coward, a traytor or cold cinique Or any other weake, and vitious person Of force I must be such. O gracious Madam, How glorious soeuer, or deform'd, I doe appeare in the Sceane, my part being ended, And all my borrowed ornaments put off, I am no more, nor lesse then what I was Before I enter'd. Domit. Come you would put on A wilfull ignorante, and not vnderstand, What 'tis we point at. Must we in plaine language, Against the decent modestie of our sex, Say that we loue thee: loue thee to enioy thee, Or that in our desires thou art preferr'd, And CÃ¦sar but thy second? thou in iustice If from the height of Maiestie we can (Looke downe vpon thy lownesse and embrace it,) Art bound with seruor to looke vp to me. Par. O Madam heare me with a patient eare And be but pleas'd to vnderstand the reasons That doe deterre me from a happinesse Kings would be riuals for. Can I that owe, My life, and all that's mine to CÃ¦sars bounties Beyond my hopes, or merits showr'd vpon me, Make payment for them with ingratitude, Falshood, and treason? Though you haue a shape Might tempt Hyppollitus, and larger power To helpe, or hurt, then wanton PhÃ¦dra had, Let loyaltie, and dutie plead my pardon Though I refuse to satisfie. Domit. You are coy Expecting I should court you, let meane Ladies Vse prayers, and intreaties to their creatures To rise vp instruments to serue their pleasures; But for Augusta so to loose her selfe That holds command o're CÃ¦sar, and the world, Were pouertie of spirit. Thou must, thou shalt, The violence of my passions knowes no meane, And in my punishments, and my rewards I'll vse no moderation. Take this onely As a caution from me. Thread-bare Chastitie, Is poore in the aduancement of her seruants, But wantonnesse magnificent; and 'tis frequent To haue the Salarie of vice waigh downe The pay of vertue. So without more trifling Thy sudaine answer. Par. In what a straight am I brought in! Alas I know that the denial's death Nor can my grant discouer'd threaten more. Yet to dye innocent, and haue the glorie For all posteritie to report that I Refus'd an Empresse to preserue my faith To my great master, in true iudgement must Show fairer then to buy a guilty life, With wealth, and honours. 'Tis the base I build on, I dare not, must not, will not. Domit. How contemn'd? Since hopes, nor feares in the extreames preuaile not I must vse a meane. Thinke who 'tis sues to thee Denie not that yet which a brother may Grant to his sister: as a testimonie CÃ¦sar, Aretinus, Iulia, Domitilla, CÃ¦nis aboue. I am not scorn'd. Kisse me. Kisse me againe. Kisse closer. Thou art now my Troyan Paris And I thy Helen. Par. Since it is your will. CÃ¦s. And I am Menelaus. But I shall be CÃ¦sar descends. Something I know not yet. Domit. Why lose we time And opportunitie. These are but sallads To sharpen appetite. Let vs to the feast. Courting Paris wantonly. Where I shall wish that thou wert Jupiter And I Alcmena, and that I had power To lengthen out one short night into three, And so beget a Hercules. CÃ¦s. While Amphitrio Stands by, and drawes the curtaines. Par. Oh?â falls on his face. Domit. Betrai'd? CÃ¦s. No, taken in a net of Vulcans filing, Wherein my selfe the Theater of the Gods Are sad spectators, not one of em daring To witnesse with a smile he does desire To be so sham'd for all the pleasure that You haue sold your being for. What shall I name thee? Ingratefull, trecherous, insatiate, all Inuectiues, which in bitternes of spirit Wrong'd men haue breath'd out against wicked women, Cannot expresse thee. Haue I rays'd thee from Thy lowe condition to the height of greatnesse, Command, and Maiestie in one base act To render me (that was before I hugg'd thee) An adder in my bosome, more then man A thing beneath a boast? did I force these Of mine owne bloud as handmaids to kneele to Thy pompe, and pride, hauing my selfe no thought But how with benefits to binde thee mine; And am I thus rewarded? not a knee? Nor teare? nor signe of sorrow for thy fault? Breake stubborne silence. What canst thou alleage To stay my vengeance? Domit. This. Thy lust compell'd me To be a strumpet, and mine hath return'd it In my intent, and will, though not in act To cuukcold thee. CÃ¦s. O impudence ! take her hence, And let her make her entrance into hell. By leauing life with all the tortures that Flesh can be sensible of. Yet stay. What power Her beautie still holds o're my soule that wrongs Of this vnpardonable nature cannot teach me To tight my selfe and hate her?âKill her.âHold. O that my dotage should increase from that Which should breed detestation. By Minerua If I looke on her longer. I shall melt And sue to her. My iniuries forgot Againe to be receiu'd into her fauour Could honour yeild to it! Carrie her to her Chamber, Be that her prison till in cooler bloud I shall determine of her. Exit with Domitia. Aret. Now step I in While he's in this calme mood for my rewardâ Sir, if my seruice hath deseru'd. CÃ¦s. Yes. Yes, And I'll reward thee, thou hast rob'd me of All rest, and peace, and bin the principall meanes To make me know that, of which if againe Enter Guard. I could be ignorant of. I would purchase it With the losse of Empire; strangle him, take these hence to And lodge them in the dungeon, could your reason Dull wretches flatter you with hope to thinke That this discouerie that hath showr'd vpon me Perpetuall vexation should not fall Heauie on you? away with 'em, stop their mouthes I will heare no reply, O Paris. Paris Exeunt Guard Aretinus, Iulia, CÃ¦nis. Domitilla. How shall I argue with thee? how begin, To make thee vnderstand before I kill thee, With what griefe and vnwillingnes 'tis forc'd from me? Yet in respect I haue fauourd thee. I will heere What thou canst speake to qualefie, or excuse Thy readinesse to serue this womans lust. And wish thou couldst giue me such satisfaction As I might burie the remembrance of it; Looke vp. We stand attentiue; Par. O dread CÃ¦sar, To hope for life, or pleade in the defence Of my ingratitude were againe to wrong you. I know I haue deseru'd death. And my suit is That you would hasten it: yet that your highnes When I am dead (as sure I will not liue) May pardon me I'll onely vrge my frailtie, Her will, and the temptation of that beautie Which you could not resist. How would poore I then Fly that which followd me, and CÃ¦sar su'd for? This is all. And now your sentence. CÃ¦s. Which I know not How to pronounce, O that thy fault had bin But such as I might pardon; if thou hadst In wantonnesse (like Nero) fir'd proud Rome Betraide an armie, butcherd the whole Senate, Committed Sacriledge, or any crime The iustice of our Roman lawes cals death, I had preuented any intercession And freely sign'd thy pardon. Par. But for this Alas you cannot, nay you must not Sir Nor let it to posteritie be recorded That CÃ¦sar vnreueng'd, sufferd a wrong, Which if a priuate man should sit downe with it Cowards would baffell him. CÃ¦s. With such true feeling Thou arguest against thy selfe, that it Workes more vpon me, then if my Minerua (The grand protectresse of my life, and Empire,) On forfeite of her fauour, cry'd aloud CÃ¦sar show mercie. And I know not how I am inclinde to it. Rise. I'll promise nothing, Yet cleare thy cloudie feares and cherish hopes, What we must doe, we shall doe; we remember A Tragedie, we oft haue seen with pleasure, Call'd, the False Seruant. Par. Such a one we haue Sir. CÃ¦s. In which a great Lord takes to his protection A man forlorne, giuing him ample power To order, and dispose of his estate In his absence he pretending then a iourney. But yet with this restraint that on no tearmes This Lord suspecting his wines constancie (She hauing playd false to a former husband) The seruant though sollicited should consent Though she commanded him to quench her flames. Par. That was indeed the argument. CÃ¦s. And what Didst thou play in it? Par. The false seruant Sir. CÃ¦s. Thou didst indeed. Do the Players waite without? Par. They doe Sir and prepar'd to act the storie Your Maiestie mention'd. CÃ¦s. Call 'em in. Who presents The iniur'd Lord? Enter Ãsopus, Latinus, a Boy drest for a Ladie. Ãsop. T'is my part Sir, CÃ¦s. Thou didst not Doe it to the life. We can performe it better. Off with my Robe, and wreath, since Nero scorn'd not The publike Theater, we in priuate may Disport our selues. This cloake, and hat without Wearing a beard, or other propertie Will fit the person. Ãsop. Onely Sir a foyle The point, and edge rebutted, when you act To doe the murther. If you please to vse this And lay aside your owne sword. CÃ¦s. By no meanes. In iest nor earnest this parts neuer from me. We'l haue but one short Sceane. That where the Ladie In an imperious way commands the seruant To be vnthankefull to his patron when My cue's to enter prompt me nay begin And doe it spritely though but a new Actor, When I come to execution you shall find No cause to laugh at me. Lat. In the name of wonder What's CÃ¦sars purpose? Ãsop. There is no contending. CÃ¦s. Why when? Par. I am arm'd. And stood grim death now within my view and his Vneuitable dart aim'd at my breast His cold embraces should not bring an ague To any of my faculties, till his pleasures Were seru'd, and satisfied, which done Nestors yeeres, To me would be vnwelcome. Boy. Must we intreate, That were borne to command, or court a seruant (That owes his foode and cloathing to our bountie) For that, which thou ambitiouslie shouldst kneele for? Vrge not in thy excuse the fauours of Thy absent Lord, or that thou standst ingag'd For thy life to his Charitie; nor thy feares Of what may follow, it being in my power To mould him any way. Par. As you may me In what his reputation is not wounded Nor I his creature in my thankefulnesse suffer. I know you are young, and faire, be vertuous too And loyall to his bed, that hath aduanc'd you To th'height of happinesse. Boy. Can my louesicke heart Be cur'd with counsell? or durst reason euer Offer to put in an exploded plea In the Court of Venus. My desires admit not The least delay. And therefore instantly Giue me to vnderstand what I shall trust to. For if I am refus'd, and not enioy Those rauishing pleasures from thee, I run mad for; I'll sweare vnto my Lord at his returne (Making what I deliuer good with teares) That brutishly thou wouldst haue forc'd from me What I make suit for. And then but imagine What 'tis to dye with these words slaue, and traytor, With burning corrassues writ vpon thy forehead, And liue prepar'd fort. Par. This he will beleeue Vpon her information. 'Tis apparent And then I am nothing. And of two extreames Wisedome sayes chose the lesse. Rather then fall Vnder your indignation, I will yeeld This kisse, and this confirmes it. Ãsop. Now. Sir now. CÃ¦s. I must take them at it. Ãsop. Yes Sir, be but perfect. CÃ¦s. O villaine! thankelesse villaine! I should talke now; But I haue forgot my part. But I can doe, Thus, thus, and thus. Kils Paris. Par. Oh, I am slaine in earnest. CÃ¦s. 'Tis true, and 'twas my purpose my good Paris And yet before life leaue thee, let the honour I haue done thee in thy death bring comfort to thee If it had beene within the power of CÃ¦sar His dignitie preseru'd he had pardon'd thee. But crueltie of honour did deny it. Yet to confirme I lou'd thee? 'twas my study To make thy end more glorious to distinguish My Paris from all others, and in that Haue showne my pittie. Nor would I let thee fall By a Centurions sword, or haue thy limbes Rent peece meale by the hangmans hooke howeuer: Thy crime deseru'd it: but as thou didst liue Romes brauest Actor, 'twas my plot that thou Shouldst dye in action, and to crowne it dye With an applause induring to all times, By our imperiall hand. His soule is freed From the prison of his flesh, let it mount vpward. And for this truncke when that the funerall pile Hath made it ashes, we'l see it inclos'd In a golden vrne. Poets adorne his hearse With their most rauishing sorrowes, and the stage For euer mourne him, and all such as were His glad spectators weepe his suddaine death, The cause forgotten in his Epitaph. Exeunt. A sad musicke the Players bearing off Paris body, CÃ¦sar and the rest following. The end of the fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS, V. SCÃNA, 1. Enter Parthenius, Stephanos, Guard. Parth. Keepe a strong guard vpon him, and admit not Accesse to any, to exchange a word, Or syllable with him, till the Emperour pleases To call him to his presence. The relation That you haue made me Stephanos of these late Strange passions in CÃ¦sar, much amaze me. The informer Aretinus put to death For yeelding him a true discouerie Of th'Empresse wantonnesse; poore Paris kild first And now lamented; and the Princesses Confin'd to seuerall Islands, yet Augusta The machine on which all this mischiefe mou'd Receiu'd againe to grace? Steph. Nay courted to it. (Such is the impotence of his affection) Yet, to conceale his weaknesse he giues out The people made suit for her, whom they hate more Then ciuill warre, or famine. But take heed My Lord, that nor in your consent nor wishes You lent or furtherance, or fauour to The plot contriu'd against her, should she proue it, Nay doubt it onely you are a lost man Her power o're doting CÃ¦sar being now Greater then euer. Parth. 'Tis a truth I shake at. And when there's opportunitie. Steph. Say but doe I am yours, and sure. Parth. I will Stand one tryall more And then you shall heare from me. Steph. Now obserue The fondnesse of this tyranne, and her pride. Enter CÃ¦sar and Domitia. CÃ¦s. Nay all's forgotten. Domit. It may be on your part. CÃ¦s. Forgiuen to Domitia 'tis a fauour That you should welcome with more cheerefull lookes Can CÃ¦sar pardon what you durst not hope for That did the iniurie, and yet must sue To her whose guilt is wash'd off by his mercy Onely to entertaine it? Domit. I ask'd none, And I should be more wretched to receiue Remission (for what I hold no crime) But by a bare acknowledgement then if By sleighting, and contemning it, as now I dar'd thy vtmost furie. Though thy flatterers Perswade thee, that thy murthers, lusts, and rapes Are vertues in thee, and what pleases CÃ¦sar Though neuer sowniust is right, and lawfull; Or worke in thee a false beliefe that thou Art more then mortall, yet I to thy teeth (When circl'd with thy Guards, thy rods, thy axes, And all the ensignes of thy boasted power) Will say Domitian, nay adde to it CÃ¦sar Is a weake feeble man, a bondman to His violent passions, and in that my slaue, Nay more my slaue, then my affections made me To my lou'd Paris. CÃ¦s. Can I liue, and heare this? Or heare and not reuenge it? come, you know The strength that you hold on me, doe not vse it VVith too much crueltie, for though 'tis granted That Lidian Omphale had lesse command O're Hercules, then you vsurpe ore me, Reason may teach me to shake off the yoke Of my fond dotage. Domit. Neuer, doe not hope it It cannot be. Thou bring my beauties captiue And not to be redeem'd, my Empire's larger Then thine Domitian, which I'll exercise VVith rigor on thee, for my Paris death. And when I haue forc'd those eyes now red with fury To drop downe teares, in vaine spent to appease me I know thy feruor such to my embraces (Which shall be, though still kneel'd for, stil deni'd thee) That thou with languishment shalt with my Actor Did liue againe, so thou might'st be his second To feede vpon those delicates, when he's sated. CÃ¦s. O my Minerua! Domit. There she is inuoke her Shee cannot arme thee with abilitie To draw thy sword on me, my power being greater. Or onely say to thy Centurions Dare none of you doe what I shake to thinke on? And in this womans death remoue the furies That euery houre afflict mee? Lamias wrongs When thy lust forc'd mee from him, are in mee At the height reveng'd, nor would I out-liue Paris But that thy loue increasing with my hate May adde vnto thy torments, so withall Contempt I can I leaue thee. Exit Domitia. CÃ¦s. I am lost Nor am I CÃ¦sar, when I first betray'd The freedome of my faculties, and will To this imperious Siren, I layd downe The Empire of the world, and of my selfe At her proud feete. Sleepe all my irefull powers? Or is the magique of my dotage such That I must still make suite to heare those charmes That doe increase my thraldome? wake my anger, For shame breake through this Lethargie, and appeare With vsuall terror, and enable mee (Since I weare not a sword to pierce her heart, Nor haue a tongue to say this let her dye) Though 'tis done with a feauer-shaken hand Pulls out a Table booke. To signe her death, assist mee great Minerua And vindicate thy votarie. So shee's now Among the list of those I haue prescrib'd. And are to free mee of my doubts, and feares, To dye to morrow. (Writes.) Steph. That same fatall booke Was neuer drawne yet, but some men of rancke Were mark'd out for destruction. Parth. I begin To doubt my selfe. CÃ¦s. Who waites there? Parth. CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. So. These that command arm'd troupes quake, at my frownes And yet a woman sleights 'em. Where's the Wizard Wee charg'd you to fetch in? Parth. Readie to suffer What death you please t'appoint him. CÃ¦s. Bring him in. Enter Ascletario, Tribunes, Guard. We'll question him our selfe. Now you that hold Intelligence with the starres, and dare prefixe The day and houre in which we are to part With life and Empire, punctually fore-telling The meanes, and manner of our violent end, As you would purchase credit to your art Resolue me since you are assur'd of vs What fate attends your selfe? Asclet. I haue had long since A certaine knowledge, and assure as thou Shalt dye to morrow being the fourteenth of The Kalends of October, the houre fiue Spite of preuention, this carkasse shall be Torne and deuourd by dogs, and let that stand for a firme prediction. CÃ¦s. May our body wretch Find neuer nobler Sepulcher if this Fall euer on thee. Are we the great disposer Of life, and death yet cannot mocke the starres In such a trifle? Hence with the impostor, And hauing cut his throat, erect a pile Guarded with souldiers, till his cursed truncke Be turn'd to ashes, vpon forfeite of Your life, and theirs, performe it. Asclet. 'Tis in vaine, When what I haue foretold is made apparent Tremble to thinke what followes. CÃ¦s. Drag him hence The Guard beare off Ascletario. And doe as I command you. I was neuer Fuller of confidence, for hauing got The victorie of my passions, in my freedome From proud Domitia (who shall cease to liue Since she disdaines to loue) I rest vnmou'd And in defiance of prodigious meteors, Chaldeans vaine predictions, iealous feares Of my neere friends, and freemen, certaine hate Of kindred, and alliance, or all terrors The souldiers doubted faith, or peoples rage Can bring to shake my constancie I am arm'd. That scrupulous thing still'd Conscience is fear'd vp And I insensible of all my actions For which by morrall and religious fooles I stand condemn'd, as they had neuer beene And since I haue subdu'd triumphant loue I will not deifie pale captiue feare Nor in a thought receiue it. For till thou Wisest Minerua that from my first youth, Hast beene my sole protectresse, dost forsake me Not Iunius Rusticus, threatned apparition, Nor what this Southsayer but eu'n now foretold (Being things impossible to humane reason) Shall in a dreame disturbe me. Bring my couch there Enter with couch. A sudaine but a secure drousinesse Inuites me to repose my selfe. Let Musicke With some choyse dittie second it. I the meane time Rest there deare booke, which open'd when I wake Layes the booke vnder his Pillow, The Musicke and song. CÃ¦sar sleepes. Shall make some sleepe for euer. Enter Parthenius and Domitia. Domit. Write my name In his bloudie scrole Parthenius? the feare's idle He durst not, could not. Parth. I can assure nothing But I obseru'd when you departed from him After some little passion, but much furie, He drew it out, whose death he sign'd I know not But in his lookes appear'd a resolution Of what before he staggerd at. What he hath Determin'd of is vncertaine, but too soone Will fall on you, or me, or both, or any Has pleasure knowne to the Tribunes, and Centurions. Who neuer vse to enquire his will but serue it. Now if out of the confidence of your power, The bloudie Catalogue being still about him As he sleepes you dare peruse it, or remoue it You may instruct your selfe or what to suffer, Or how to crosse it. Domit. I would not be caught With too much confidence. By your leaue Sir. Ha! No motion! you lye vneasie Sir, Let me mend your Pillow. Parth. Haue you it? Domit. 'Tis heere. CÃ¦s. Oh. Parth. You haue wak'd him, softly gracious Madam While we are vnknowne, and then consult at leisure. Exeunt Parthenius, and Domitia. A dreadfull Musicke sounding, Enter Junius Rusticus, and Palphurius Sura, with bloudie swords, they waue them ouer his head. CÃ¦sar in his sleepe troubled, seemes to pray to the Jmage, they scornefully take it away. [CÃ¦s.] Defend me goddesse, or this horrid dreame Will force me to destraction. Whether haue These furies borne thee? Let me rise! and follow I am bath'd o're with the cold sweat of death, And am depriu'd of organs to pursue These sacriligious spirits. Am I at once Robd of my hopes, and being? No, I liue Rises destractedly. Yes liue, and haue discourse to know my selfe Of Gods, and men forsaken. What accuser Within me cries aloud, I haue deseru'd it, It being iust to neither. Who dares speake this? Am I not CÃ¦sar? how I againe repeate it? Presumptuous traytor thou shalt dye, what traytor? He that hath beene a traytor to himselfe And stands conuicted heere. Yet who can sit A competent Iudge ore CÃ¦sar? CÃ¦sar. Yes CÃ¦sar by CÃ¦sar's, sentenc'd. and must suffer Minerua cannot saue him. Ha! where is she? Where is my goddesse? vanish'd! I am lost then No 'twas no dreame, but a most reall truth That Iunius Rusticus, and Palphurius Sura, Although their ashes were cast in the sea Were by their innocence made vp againe. And in corporeall formes but now appear'd. Wauing their bloudie swordes aboue my head, As at their deathes they threatned. And me thought Minerua rauish'd hence whisper'd that she Was for my blasphemies disarm'd by Joue And could no more protect me. Yes 'twas so, His thunder does confirme it, against which thunder and lightning. Howe're it spare the lawrell, this proud wreath Is no assurance. Ha! come you resolu'd Enter 3. Tribunes. To be my executioners? 1. Trib. Allegeance And faith forbid that we should lift an arme Against your sacred head. 2. Trib. We rather sue For mercie. 3. Trib. And acknowledge that in iustice Our liues are forfeited for not performing What CÃ¦sar charg'd vs. 1. Trib. Nor did we transgresse it In our want of will, or care, for being but men It could not be in vs to make resistance, The Gods fighting against vs. CÃ¦s. Speake in what Did they expresse their anger? wee will heere it But dare not say vndaunted. 1. Trib. In briefe thus Sir. The Sentence giuen by your imperiall tongue For the Astrologer Ascletario's death With speede was put in execution. CÃ¦s. Well. 1. Trib. For his throate cut, his legs bound, and his armes Pinion'd behinde his backe, the breathlesse truncke Was with all scorne dragg'd to the field of Mars And there a pile being rais'd of old dry wood, Smeer'd o're with oyle, and brimstone, or what else Could helpe to feede, or to increase the fire The Carkasse was throwne on it; but no sooner The stuffe, that was most apt, began to flame; But sudainely to the amazement of The fearelesse souldier, a sudaine flash Of lightning breaking through the scatter'd cloudes With such a horrid violence forc'd its passage And as disdaining all heate but it selfe In a moment quench'd the artificiall fire. And before we could kindle it againe A clap of thunder follow'd with such noyse, As if then Ioue incens'd against mankind, Had in his secret purposes determin'd An vniuersall ruine to the world. This horror past, not at Deucalions floud Such a stormie shower of raine (and yet that word is To narrow to expresse it) was e're seene Imagine rather Sir, that with lesse furie The Waues rush downe the Cataracts of Nile; Or that the Sea spouted into the ayre By the angry Orke, endaungering tall ships But sayling neere it, so falls downe againe, Yet heere the wonder ends not, but begins For as in vaine we labour'd to consume The witches bodye, all the Dogs of Rome Howling, and yelling like to famish'd wolues Brake in vpon vs, and though thousands were Kild in th'attempt some did ascend the pile And with their eager fangs ceas'd on the carkasse. CÃ¦s. But haue they torne it? 1. Trib. Torne it, and deuour'd it. CÃ¦s. I then am a dead man since all predictions Assure me I am lost, O my loud souldiers Your Emperour must leaue you: yet howeuer I cannot grant my selfe a short reprieue I freely pardon you. The fatall houre Steaks fast vpon me. I must dye this morning By fiue my souldiers, that's the latest houre You e're must see me liuing. 1. Trib. Ioue auert it In our swords lies your fate, and we will guard it. CÃ¦s. O no, it cannot be, it is decreed, Aboue, and by no strengths heere to be alterd. Let proud mortalitie but looke on CÃ¦sar Compass'd of late with armies, in his eyes Carrying both life, and death, and in his armes Fadoming the earth; that would be stilde a God, And is for that presumption cast beneath The low condition of a common man, Sincking with mine owne waight, 1. Trib. Doe not forsake, Your selfe wee'll neuer leaue you. 2. Trib. VVe'll draw vp More cohorts of your Guard, if you doubt treason. CÃ¦s. They cannot saue me. The offended Gods That now sit iudges on me, from their enuie Of my power and greatnesse heere, conspire against me. 1. Trib. Endeauour to appease them. CÃ¦s. 'Twill be fruitlesse I am past hope of remission. Yet could I Decline this dreadfull houre of fiue, these terrors That driue me to despaire would soone flye from me And could you but till then assure me, 1. Trib. Yes Sir, Or wee'll fall with you, and make Rome the vrne In which wee'll mix our ashes. CÃ¦s. Tis said noblie, I am something comforted. Howere to dye Is the full period of calamitie. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na, 2. Enter Parthenius, Domitia, Iulia, CÃ¦nis Domitilla, Stephanos, Sijeius, Entellus. Parth. You see we are all condemnd, there's no euasion, We must doe or suffer. Steph. But it must be sudaine The least delay is mortall. Domit. Would I were A man to giue it action. Domit: Could I make my approaches though my stature Does promise little, I haue a spirit as daring As hers, that can reach higher. Steph. I will take That burthen from you Madam. All the art is To draw him from the Tribunes that attend him For could you bring him but within my swords reach The world should owe her freedome from a tyranne, To Stephanos. Sige. You shall not share alone The glorie of a deed that will endure To all posteritie. Entel. I will put in For a part my selfe. Parth. Be resolute, and stand close. I haue conceiu'd a way, and with the hazard Of my life I'll practise it to fetch him hither. But then no trifling. Steph. We'l despatch him feare not A dead dog neuer bites. Parth. Thus then at all Parthenius goes off the rest stand aside Enter CÃ¦sar and the Tribunes. CÃ¦s. How slowe pac'd are these minutes! in extreames How miserable is the least delay! Could I iumpe feathers to the wings of time Or with as little ease command the Sunne To scourge his coursers vp heauens easterne hill Making the houre I tremble at past recalling As I can moue this dyals tongue to six, My veines, and arteries emptied with feare Would fill and swell againe. How doe I looke? Doe you yet see death about me: 1. Trib. Thinke not of him There is no danger all these prodegies That doe affright you rise from naturall causes, And though you doe ascribe them to your selfe, Had you ne're beene, had happen'd. CÃ¦s. 'Tis well said, Exceeding well braue souldier. Can it be That I that feele my selfe in health and strength Should still beleeue I am so neare my end, And haue my guards about me? perish all Predictions, I grow constant they are false And built vpon vncertainties. 1. Trib. This is right. Now CÃ¦sar's hard like CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. We will to The Campe, and hauing there confirmd the souldier With a large Donatiue, and increase of pay Some shall. I say no more. Enter Parthenius. Parth. All happinesse Securitie, long life attend vpon The Monarch of the World. CÃ¦s. Thy lookes are cheerefull, Parth. And my relation full of ioy and wonder. Why is the care of your imperiall body My Lord neglected the fear'd houre being past In which your your life was threatned. CÃ¦s. Is't past fiue? Parth. Past six vpon my knowledge, and iniustice Your Clocke master should dye that hath deferd Your peace so long. There is a post new lighted That brings assur'd intelligence, that your legions In Siria haue wonne a glorious day, And much enlarg'd your Empire. I haue kept him Conceal'd that you might first pertake the pleasure In priuate, and the Senate from your selfe Be taught to vnderstand how much they owe To you and to your fortune. CÃ¦s. Hence pale feare then Lead me Parthenius. 1. Trib. Shall we waite you? CÃ¦s. No After losses Guards are vsefull, know your distance. Exeunt CÃ¦sar and Parthenius. 2. Trib. How strangely hopes delude men, as I liue The houre is not yet come. 1. Trib. Howere we are To pay our duties, and obserue the sequele. Exeunt Trib. Enter CÃ¦sar, and Parthenius. Domit. I heare him comming, be constant. CÃ¦s. Where Parthenius is this glad messenger. Steph. Make the doore fast. Heere, a messenger of horror. CÃ¦s. How! betraid? Domit. No taken tyranne. CÃ¦s. My Domitia in the conspiracie! Parth. Behold this booke. CÃ¦s. Nay then I am lost. Yet though I am vnarm'd I'll not fall poorely. Ore throwes Stephanos. Steph. Helpe me. Entel. Thus, and thus. Sije. Are you so long a falling? CÃ¦s. 'Tis done, 'tis done basely. falls, and dyes. Parth. This for my Fathers death. Domit. This for my Paris, Iul, This for thy Incest These seuerally stab him. Domit. This for thy abuse of Domitilla. Enter Tribunes. 1. Trib. Force the doores. O Mars! What haue you done. Parth. What Rome shall giue vs thanks for. Steph. Despatch'd a Monster. 1. Trib. Yet he was our Prince How euer wicked, and in you this murther Which whosoe're succeeds him will reuenge, Nor will we that seru'd vnder his command Consent that such a monster as thy selfe (For in thy wickednesse, Augusta's title Hath quite forsooke thee) thou that wert the ground Of all these mischiefes, shall goe hence vnpunish'd. Lay hands on her. And drag her to sentence, We will referre the hearing to the Senate Who may at their best leisure censure you Take vp his body. He in death hath payd For all his cruelties. Heere's the difference Good Kings are mourn'd for after life, but ill And such as gouern'd onely by their will And not their reason. Vnlamented fall No Goodmans teare shed at their Funerall. Exeunt omnes. Florish. FINIS.</field>
