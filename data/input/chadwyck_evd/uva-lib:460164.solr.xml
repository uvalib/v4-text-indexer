      <field name="fulltext">SONNET. BLEST Authors! with whose fame the world has rung, Immortal minds, of philanthropic mold! Pathetic Richardson! sublimer Young! To you let me inscribe the leaves, that hold A theme, ye once consulted to unfold! Fairer its fortune, had not death's despite Torn from the silenc'd bard this tale half-told! O could I blend those beams, whose sep'rate light Forms each a glory round your rival brows, Sublimity and Pathos! effluence bright Of highest genius!âbut in vain such vows: Yet in the reach of emulation's flight One eminence ye share:âbe that my end! Teach me to rank with you, as Virtue's friend!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Persons of the Drama. GOVERNOR OF BARCELONA, MENDOZA, LUPERCIO, HERNANDEZ, LOPEZ. MARCELLA. Servants, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE the Governor's Castle in Barcelona.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Governor's Castle. Lupercio and Marcella. Marcella. Let ardent friendship be the bond between us, But O subdue this inauspicious love, And chace it from thy breast! Lupercio. Impossible! Think, cruel monitor, thro' what long years My heart has cherish'd an encreasing passion, Till it is grown a portion of my being, Which I can ne'er relinquish but with life! Marcella. I know, that from our days of infancy Thy vows have had the sanction of my father; And from the period when he first became The governor of this fair city, he Has lean'd towards thee with an anxious hope To call thee by the tender name of son: Nor can the world reprove his generous wishes, For Barcelona's walls contain no youth Of nobler blood, or higher estimation. Lupercio. Lovely encomiast! sure the songs of seraphs, And all the wondrous harmonies of Heaven, Can never strike more sweetly on the soul, Than the frank praise of those angelic lips. Marcella. I should despise my own uncandid heart, If it refus'd that tribute of applause Which selfish pride, and jealous envy pay To thy acknowledg'd merit.âYes! Lupercio, I own, thy rank, and thy accomplish'd youth, Might justly challenge a return of fondness From the most haughty of our flatter'd sex; Yet trust me, and I speak the words of friendship, 'Twere wiser in thee, even could my tongue Pronounce the free compliance thou entreatest, To turn thy partial eyes from cold Marcella, And for thy wife solicit me no more. Lupercio. Mock not my senses with such admonition As reason must revolt from! Wouldst thou say To the poor wretch, who after many a step O'er Afric's burning sands, half dead with drought, Holds in his parch'd and eager hand at last The liquid blessing, that he long has pin'd for; Then wouldst thou say, that wisdom bids him dash The salutary treasure from his tongue, And perish by the thirst that wastes his being? Such, and more cruel is thy counsel now, That would induce me to renounce thy charms, E'en in these moments, when thy father's friendship Had fill'd my soul with panting expectation To hear thy heavenly voice declare me happy. Marcella. I know my father's hopes; and by his worth I swear, my heart oft wishes for the power Most fondly to fulfil them. Lupercio. Ha! what bar, What secret bar, from quick-ey'd Love conceal'd, Has envious fortune rais'd to thwart our union? You say, that you regard me as your friend; Then honour me with friendship's dearest claim, Unbounded confidence!âunfold your heart!â If, to cut off the promise of my bliss, If there is aught of unknown fondness there, Which fears a father's eye, confide in me! And though against myselfâ Marcella. Ingenuous youth! Your mind is noble, but you little know Marcella's heart, above all low disguise, Proud of its truth, nor patient of controul. Lupercio. Pardon the fond surmise of fearful love! If thy soft breast is free from predilection, What other bar?âand yet there may be other; Nature perhaps has curs'd me with defects Offensive to thy sight; some natural blemish Of mind, or feature, which thy delicate sense Tries to endure, but cannot. Marcella. No! by Heaven! Except the noble stranger, whom we saw At mass this morning, and whose signal graces Drew from us both observance of his person, My eyes ne'er gaz'd upon a comelier youth: And reason tells me, that I ought to love thee: But my heart shrinks perversely from her voice. Oft have I try'd to bend my wayward spirit To crown thy constant vows, and bless my father; Yet ever as my soul pursues that thought, A secret tremor in my bosom bids me Recoil from thy embraces, whispering there, That I was only born to be thy bane. Lupercio. Thou! thou my bane!âThou art my life's support; As dear, and as essential to my being, As the blest radiance of the sun to nature. These are the airy fears of virgin softness, Most apt to harbour in the loveliest minds. Banish the visionary dread, and give Thy lighten'd heart to all the joys that court thee! Thy father's prayers, the vows of all our friends Will shed propitious lustre on our union: Hymen can never light his genial flame With happier auspices; but were they dark And hideous as the sick man's feverish dreams; Wert thou, instead of noble Garcia's heiress, The child of want, and penury thy dower, I still should pant as fondly for thy hand; Still in thy wondrous charms and lovely virtues Think all the blessings of the earth compriz'd. Marcella. I know thee generous to a fond extreme: It has subdu'd my waywardness of temper, And, spite of the reluctance that I feel To speak the important words, I will be thine. Lupercio. Blest be that sound! it is an angel's voice, Freeing the spirit of a tortur'd martyr, And opening to his view the heaven he sigh'd for. Marcella. And yet I fearâ Lupercio. Wound not enraptur'd love With vain distrust! but name the blissful day, When my fond heartâ Marcella. I said, I will be thine: Do not, with cruel importunity, Now press me farther! As I frankly told thee, My soul, I know not why, is out of tune; Give me a little time to regulate The strange emotion of my mind, and try To meet thee, as I wish, without these terrors. Lupercio. Thou dear directress of my fate! thy will Shall ever sway the conduct of my life, Howe'er it thwart me.âYet, I pray thee, name Some period, on which hope may dwell, to sooth The restless interval! or kindly give me Some pledge of thy dear promise! Marcella. Take this ring, Of curious workmanship, near Tunis found, And given my father by a noble Moor; The wife of Asdrubal, you know the figure, Plunging amidst the flames, in which she perish'd! Wear this a month, then claim me as your bride! But if you value me, preserve the jewel; For if you lose this symbol of my faith, Your negligence may lead me to retract A promise, so reluctantly pronounc'd. Lupercio. Rest here, thou radiant harbinger of bliss! Trust me, my love, and by thyself I swear, That sooner shall my soul and body part, Than this dear gem be wrested from the finger Where now it shines.âO let me kiss the hand Which has enrich'd me with a pledge so precious; And let my lips thus ratify our compact! (While he is kissing her hand, Enter the Governor, Hernandez, and a female Attendant. Governor. Why, this is well: I like this pleasing shew Of mutual tendernessâShe has relented, And will be your's, Lupercio? Lupercio. Yes, my father, I now may call you by that valued title; My blissful doom has pass'd those lovely lips, And she is now irrevocably mine. Governor. May every blessing my paternal prayers Can ask of Heaven, descend upon ye both! Thy free consent delights me; and thou art My age's comfort. Marcella. When I cease to be so, May life forsake me!â'twill have lost all value. Governor. My tender child, I thank thee: but thou lead'st me Wide of my present aim.âWith thee, Lupercio, I must on business of the state awhile Hold private converse: I'll release thee soon To the soft object of thy tend'rer thoughts. Meantime, my daughter, as the hour of vespers Now summons you, pray for us, and implore Your Guardian Saint to make your nuptials happy. Your servants wait youâGo!âon your return You'll find us in the castle, and at leisure To dedicate the hours to love and joy.â Now mark me, thou brave youth. (Retires to the farther part of the stage with Lupercio.) Marcella. Hernandez, you may rest at homeâyou know 'Tis not your duty to attend on me, As I have oft inform'd you.âIt is strange My father suffers his old foolish steward To pester me with such officious service. Hernandez. Dear lady, do not frownâI have no joy But to gaze on you, wheresoe'er you go, And follow like your shadow.âWould my shape Were half so graceful!âthen I think your eyes Could never view me with an angry glance. Marcella. Hence, saucy vassal!âHowsoe'er my father Use thy preposterous passion for his mirth, It shall not thus insult me.âHence! I bid thee For ever shun my presence. [Drops her glove. Hernandez (presenting the glove.) But kind chance Is more my friend, and makes me still your servant. Marcella. Away! fantastic insolence! be gone! I will not feed thy vanity, by wearing Aught which thy touch has sullied. Isabel, Take it, and draw its fellow from my arm! Bring other gloves, and follow me to vespers. [Exeunt Marcella and her Attendant. Hernandez. Insulting fair! I yet may find a moment To triumph o'er thy scorn. The Governor and Lupercio advance from the end of the stage. Governor. How now, Hernandez! What! has your mistress chid you from her presence? I am indeed to blame, to treat so long Your fooleries with levity and laughter. Henceforth, in this my young and noble friend You must respect a husband's dignity, And dare to wound my daughter's ear no more With sounds of amorous dotage. Lupercio. Good Hernandez, You know the infirmity of Spanish husbands; And you're so studied in your lady's temper, I may regard you as a dangerous rival. Hernandez. I stand corrected.â(Aside.) Curse his happy stars! And curse his proud and thinly-veil'd contempt! Howe'er deformity may make my figure The butt of his derision, I've a spirit, In which this fair-limb'd youth may feel a rival More dangerous than his vanity believes. [Exit. Governor. That faithful servant is depriv'd of sense By the absurdest passion that e'er triumph'd O'er manly reason: he was justly noted For the best qualities that grace his station, Intelligence and duty, till my daughter Advanc'd to womanhood; but from that period, E'en in proportion as her beauties ripen'd, His faculties have seem'd upon the wane. I have too lightly sported with his frenzy, Which call'd for harsher discipline. Lupercio. O! no, I feel he is entitled to compassion; Marcella has those fascinating charms, Which may intoxicate the soberest mind, Till all its senses reel.âI cannot wonder Age and deformity forget their nature By living in her sight, and only feel That she has beauty which inflames to madness. Governor. She may indeed (with pride the father speaks it) Be number'd with the loveliest of her sex. With joy, brave youth, but with an anxious joy, I give her to thy guard. Lupercio. Doubt not my love! Governor. Trust me, I do not: but anxiety Is the high tax, which fond affection pays For all its pleasures; and parental hearts, As thou may'st prove hereafter, pay it double. Besides, my daughter, lovely as she is, Has qualities that claim the nicest care. Lupercio. She has a generous pride, which to her soul Gives awful beauty, and proclaims it free From all that poor and petty artifice, Which manly arrogance presumes to think Inherent in her sex. Governor. You know, Lupercio, She is the only child that ever nature Enrich'd me with; my tenderness, disdaining The rigid customs of her sex and country, Has rear'd her with a freedom little known To Spanish fair-ones; for I wish'd to make her, Not the cag'd vassal of parental power, But truth and nature's chaste and free disciple. Her early temper join'd with my affection To fix me in this conduct; for, believe me, Her mind is like the element of fire; Treat it with gentle caution, it will shine The radiant minister of joy and comfort; But close confinement, or a blind neglect, May rouse its perilous energies to spread Unthought-of scenes of misery and terror. Lupercio. Trust me, I never will prophane her virtue With abject jealousy and harsh constraint. Governor. On this nice topic, in our hours of leisure, We'll speak more largely, when your just affection Will give kind audience to a father's counsel. Now other cares demand us.âYou forget The business I've entrusted to your guidance, Which calls for quick dispatch. Lupercio. Forgive me, Sir! May love, that miser, who locks up our thoughts, Nor lets them circulate, as duty orders, Plead with me for your pardon!âI am gone. [Exit. Governor. My blessing be thy guard!âLong have I wish'd To give my daughter to this virtuous youth; But 'tis the doom of age, in deeds of moment, To feel the fit of warm desire succeeded By terror's aguish tremblings. I begin To fear I've press'd too far her generous mind, To what her heart recoils from; for she weds To indulge a father's wishes, not her own. 'Tis true, the tenderest motives have impell'd me To urge this union, eager to entrust Her peace and honour to a kind protector: But anxious love, tho' probity may guide it, Oft, with a fond precipitancy, foils Its own dear purpose, and with dizzy rashness Leaps in the dreaded gulph it strives to shun.â My child return'd so soon! and with a stranger! What may this mean? Enter Marcella and Mendoza. Mendoza. It moves, I see, thy wonder, Thou honour'd veteran, that thus uncheck'd By ceremony's just observances, A youth unknown intrudes upon thy presence, And dares to make this lovely maid his herald. Governor. Whoe'er thou art, young Signor, I must own Thy graceful semblance prompts me to believe Thou hast no common claim to courtesy. Mendoza. 'Tis possible thou art not unacquainted With young Mendoza's name. Governor. Who knows it not? Spain has no martial son, whose generous veins Hold richer blood; and fame reports Mendoza A youth, whose opening virtues have reflected New honour on his noble ancestry. Our country, with a fond, impatient pride, Expects him from his travels; but 'tis said That, grac'd with a discerning monarch's friendship, He purposes to pass another year At the Imperial court. Mendoza. Such as he is, Mendoza stands before thee, and thou seest him An anxious, humble suitor to thy bounty. Governor. To me, my Lord! Mendoza. To thee, thou happy father! To thee, thou blest possessor of a treasure, That turns all other wealth to poverty! Oft had I heard thy lovely daughter prais'd As beauty's standard, and no more allowing A competition with inferior fair-ones, Than the rich diamond's blaze admits compare With the dark amethyst, or clouded opal. It was my wish, in passing thro' your city, Unknown to gaze upon this beauteous wonder, As on a prodigy of nature's work, Supreme in loveliness; which to have seen, Gives to the eye that saw it a proud sparkle Of exultation, whensoe'er 'tis nam'd. Governor. This lavish praise, my Lord, at once o'erwhelms me With joy and pain; and both in the extreme. Pray do not spoil, by thus o'er-rating them, The simple charms of an unpolish'd girl! Mendoza. Your pardon!â'tis not in the power of language To state their excellence.âAt mass this morning My eager eyes first feasted on their sight: I thought I ne'er had seen till that blest moment; For on my ravish'd sense her beauty burst, Dazzling and dear, as new-imparted light To one, whose visual organs from his childhood Had pin'd in moping darknessâfrom that hour My heart cries loudly, that the earth contains No prize worth my contention, but her love.â Report inform'd me, that her soft affections Are yet unfix'd; tho' an accomplish'd youth, Fondly presuming on a father's friendship, Hopes hourly for the promise of her hand. Fir'd by these tidings, as again I saw her Approach the hallow'd precincts of the temple, I threw me at her feet, conjur'd her pity To guide me to your presence, and implor'd The Guardian Saint, whose votary I sued to, That when we next that sacred pavement trod, Heaven might exalt me to the blissful honour To lead her to the altar. Marcella. Oft in vain I pray'd the gallant stranger to forbear His unavailing suit, nor vex my father With fruitless importunity. Mendoza. To both I bend for pardon, that my violent love Dar'd to o'er-rule the mortifying counsel Of maidenly reserve, and modest fear. If yet thy heart, that throne of happiness, Be vacant, I implore thy father's leave To join the contest for a prize, whose value Might tempt the monarchs of the world in arms To hazard each his empire. Governor. Noble youth! Thy generous warmth so wins on my esteem, I will entrust thy own ingenuous heart To judge the cause, where e'en thy love's a party. The hour's not past, in which, with her assent, I gave my daughter to a valiant friend, Who long has lov'd her; tho' I frankly own His birth and fortune make him not thy equal. Such is my story: now assume my place, And answer for me! Say! shall I, a soldier, An old plain soldier, honesty my pride! Shall I revoke my promise, at the lure Of interest and ambition? Mendoza. Thou hast found The way to vanquish all Mendoza's ardour: Thy words benumb my soul; but thou shalt see My wounded heart has virtue to decide Against itself. Mendoza's voice shall never Prompt to the lips of honourable age The abject sounds of infamy.âShalt thou Revoke thy promise! no! thou brave old man, Not tho' my life should end by its completion! Let the vain sons of Italy and France Attempt, by mental alchemy, to turn The lead of falshood into wisdom's gold, And sink, their own poor bubbles, in the trial! It is the glory of a true Castilian To scorn such arts, and hold his word once given As sacred as the fiat of a God. Governor. There spoke the spirit of Castilian honour. Brave youth! I yet will love thee as my son, Tho' fate forbid such union.âLet us hence, It may amuse thy generous mind to shew thee The precincts of our castle. Mendoza. Well thou warnest Thy giddy guest to fly a dangerous banquet, Where his warm soul drinks poison.âMatchless fair-one! I must perforce from thy enchanting presence Tear my reluctant heart, while yet I can; Before the firm resolve of honour melts In that full blaze of frenzy-kindling beauty. I go:âStill, ere I quit these walls for ever, I shall implore one parting interview; But for a few short moments, but to utter My ardent vows, that Heaven may make thee happy; And to entreat, that as the years roll on, And bring thee, as I hope they will, new blessings, Thou'lt deign, at least on this revolving day, To think not harshly of my hapless passion, And give one sigh of pity to Mendoza. [Exit, with the Governor. Marcella. He's gone, ere my full heart allow'd me power To frame one grateful accent to the man, For whom alone my unconstrained lips Could utter vows of genuine tenderness. Enchanting youth!âDost thou implore my pity? Thou canst not need compassion: love and joy Will, as thy guardian spirits, hover round thee. I am the wretch, whose lacerated mind Cries out for pity, which I do not merit. Fool that I was! by a reluctant promise To violate the heart's prerogative! This injur'd sovereign now awakes to vengeance, And I deserve these tortures.âO Lupercio! Thou wert before an object, from whose touch My conscious frame recoil'd.âWhat art thou now? Thy very name is discord in my ear, That agitates my wounded brain to frenzy. And shall I wed thee? take thee to my bosom? An aspic sooner! from whose dearer clasp My miseries might hope for welcome death! Yet how escape thee, and maintain at once My father's honour and my own unshaken? O for some kind assistant! whose invention May o'er my darken'd thoughts diffuse one glimpse Of cheering light!âHere comes a minister Who wants not will to serve me. Enter Hernandez. Hernandez. Haste, dear lady; Your father asks a moment's parley with you In private, and before he walks abroad To show our ramparts to a noble stranger. Marcella. Canst thou, Hernandez, banish from thy memory All my past anger, and exert thy powers To gain my favor by one signal service? Hernandez. Ask me if I exist; for while I live, I hold my life devoted to your pleasure. Marcella. I'll put thee to the trial, for the task Allows not e'en a moment of delay. Know then, I foolishly have given Lupercio My ring, the pledge of an unguarded promise, Which my wrong'd heart forbids me to fulfil. I warn'd him, if he chanc'd to lose the jewel, Our compact should be void.âIf thou'lt devise Some lucky artifice to lure it from him, Thou shalt have thrice the value of the gem. Hernandez. Wouldst thou elude thy nuptials with Lupercio? The blest intelligence revives my soul! Marcella. He is the hated bar, on whose removal My heart might enter paradise, and follow The dear suggestions of unfetter'd love. Hernandez. Enough! thou shalt be mistress of thyself. Marcella. Make me but thatâMy father callsâbut that, And I'll reward thee, till thyself shalt own My gratitude a prodigal in bounty. Lose not a momentâset me free to-night, And thro' my every hour of future life I'll bless thee for the service. [Exit. Hernandez. Then to-night Shall rid thee of Lupercio.âThou shalt feel, Sarcastic boy! I am a dangerous rival. I know in what lone quarter of the ramparts Nightly thou walk'st in amorous contemplation, Murmuring fantastic crotchets to the moon: There if I miss thee, still the blended fires Of love and of revenge shall aid my search, And guide my thirsty poniard to thy heart. End of ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE. I. Marcella (alone.) The night is past, but the all-cheering morn Fails to dispel the darkness of my soul: My restless heart yet beats with blended throbs: Of anguish and delight, at the idea That these fond eyes may, with my father's leave, Gaze once again upon the dear Mendoza. O might they in our parting close for ever!â 'Tis strange I yet hear nothing of Hernandez. But what can he?âI was indeed an idiot To think his paltry aid could terminate My miseries; I might as well believe That the poor current of a scanty brook Might quench the conflagration of the globe. O would those final flames, that will consume This gloomy world, this stage of wretchedness, Were kindling now! for my deliver'd soul, Escaping from worse horrors, could rejoice In that dread scene of fiery desolation, And think it bliss to perish with Mendoza. Mendoza (entering.) âAnd think it bliss to perish with Mendoza!â Extatic sounds! may I believe my sense! Have I such tender interest in that bosom? Marcella. 'Tis not well done, my lord, thus at the dawn To steal upon my privacy, and rob A wounded spirit of its sole support, The secrecy of woes beyond a cure. Mendoza. Pardon the impatient speed of anxious passion! I have nor rest, nor joy, but in thy presence, And hasten'd to thee, in the sad belief, (A burthen which my heart would now throw off) That this dear interview must prove the last. Marcella. The last indeed it must be! Mendoza. If thy voice Can speak with such sweet kindness of Mendoza, Thou wilt revoke that sentence; and what power Shall burst the hallow'd ties of mutual love, And tear our wedded spirits from each other? Marcella. The ruler of thy life, imperious Honour! Honour, who has already by thy voice Pronounc'd the firm immutable decree, That this ill-fated hand must not be thine. Mendoza. Urge not against me the confus'd decision Of ignorance and blind mistaken pride! When I confirm'd thy father in his purpose, I knew not, that to keep his fatal word He must become a tyrant to thy heart, And violate the dearest rights of nature. I knew not that Mendoza's ardent love Had in thy bosom rais'd the blest emotion Of tender sympathy. Marcella. O that my heart Had not unwarily betray'd its weakness! Then might a just ingenuous pride have taught me To bear the painful secret to my grave. Mendoza. Unkindly said!âIf such could be thy wish, Thou hast not lov'd Mendoza. Marcella. Think so ever! I have not lov'd him; duty, faith, forbid it: I am affianc'd to a generous youth, Who claims the full dominion of my heart; Nor shall Mendoza's image lurk within it, To prove the assassin of my peace and honour. Mendoza. O lovely haughtiness of mind! this conflict, This agitation of thy artless bosom, Proves the enchanting truth, I am belov'd: I read it in those sweetly-speaking eyes, Where the faint spark of anger is extinguish'd In melting tenderness. While thus I clasp thee, Kind sympathy gives to thy every nerve Delicious softness; and thy swelling heart Vibrates in unison with mine, to form Th'extatic harmony of mutual love.â Thou weep'st!âO Heaven! I feel these precious drops Fall on my wounded breast, like liquid fire. O, I had rather draw upon my head The worst of human ills, thy hate and scorn! Rather than touch thee with an ill-starr'd passion, If it must prove a source of sorrow to thee, And quench the radiance of thine eyes in tears. Marcella. I can believe thee, for thy noble soul Is honour's sanctuary.âThen, as my friend, Let me implore the firmness of thy spirit To aid the treacherous failing of my own! I am indeed unpractis'd in the arts My sex is fam'd for; I have not the skill To hide th'emotions of a feeling heart: And I will lay it open to thy view. I will avow, that if my wayward fortune Had not forbid the union of our hands, I would have met the ardour of thy vows With all the frankness of simplicity, Proud of its pleasing lot. I would have pray'd For undecaying charms to keep thy love, Blessing the God who form'd us for each other. But since the barâ Mendoza. There is, there shall be none: We'll urge thy heart's unalienable right To be the sole disposer of thy beauty. Marcella. O speak not thus!âmy own unbalanc'd mind, Whirl'd in the eddies of tempestuous thought, Already has been hurried much too far From the safe course integrity prescribes. But the remembrance of thy bright example Shall be my glorious guide, and still preserve me. How nobly hast thou said, thou wouldst not urge My honour'd father to revoke his promise, Not if thy life should end by its completion! Shalt thou, a stranger! thus against thyself Stand forth the firm asserter of his honour, And shall his child betray it? Mendoza. Do not wound Thy own pure spirit by this groundless scruple! Marcella. It is conviction, founded on the laws, Th'unquestionable laws of faith and virtue. I must for ever fly thee, or disgrace My father and myself. And shall I heap Grief, disappointment, misery, and shame Upon my father's head? And what a father! Rough as he is in the rude scene of arms, The sternest soldier of his time, to me The awful thunder of his voice has soften'd E'en to the tender sweetness of a lute. With me he has for ever thrown aside All the asperities of harsh command, And disciplin'd my wayward infancy With all the mildness of a mother's love. Mendoza. O might I aid thee in thy dearest office, To pay him back those long and large arrears Of tenderness and care!âYes! we will make it The incessant study of our days to lighten Whatever load encroaching age lays on him; And by the sweet solicitude extend The limit of his blest and honour'd life. Marcella. Could it be such, our lot indeed were happy; But 'tis impossible. Should I, forgetting The sanctity of promises, should I Attempt to burst the fetters that involve me, And struggle to be your's, it could not be: Kind as he is, my father's firmer spirit In points of honour is inflexible! Could I myself descendâand wounded pride Revolts at the ideaâcould I stoop. To beg, that he would countenance my falshood, I know his answer.ââWould'st thou,â he would cry, âMake me an object of the world's contempt? Shall I be censur'd as a sordid wretch, Who, having given my daughter to a friend, Cheated his hopes, and sold her venal beauty To the rich splendor of Mendoza's fortune?â Mendoza. Perish the envious spirits, who could harbour So base a thought of him who gave thee being! But should he be reproach'd, (as purest virtue, And the beneficence of Heaven itself, 'Scapes not such prophanation) it were better, Than to behold thy peace of mind destroy'd, And thy soft heart corroded by the shackles, The galling shackles of a joyless marriage.â Think what it is to press the nuptial couch, When, for the roses Love should scatter there, The fiend Antipathy has form'd its pillow Of sharpest thorns, that lacerate the brain! Marcella. I know it must be agony far worse Than death's severest pang: the thought already Has thrown my troubled mind from off its balance, And plung'd me in distraction.âThou art cruel, To set my woes thus forcibly before me, And aggravate the anguish of my fate. Mendoza. Think rather, that with fond anxiety I warn you of the precipice you tread, And pant to save you trembling on its brink. Marcella. I pray you leave me, for your dangerous aid Can but encrease the horrors of my fall. O leave me, I conjure you! Mendoza. Once assure me, You will endeavour to draw back your hand From this abhorr'd alliance, I will rest On the faint hope which may arise from thence. Marcella. Whatever I can do, and not destroy My father's peace and honour, shall be done: For O, 'tis certain, rather than be dragg'd The victim of Lupercio's nuptial triumph, My heart would chuse to languish life away In the lone walls of some sequester'd cell, Where not one pleasing sound could sooth my suffering, Save when I clos'd some melancholy prayer With the dear echo of Mendoza's name. Mendoza. Enchanting softness! thou shalt yet be mine, And these heart-rending sighs shall turn to rapture. Marcella. I hear my father's step; depart, I pray thee! Mendoza. By Heaven, my feet seem rooted to this spot, And have not power to bear me from thy presence! Enter the Governor. Governor. Ah, my young friend! youth wants a monitor To bid it mark the rapid flight of time. Is this your momentary interview? Come! force me not to play the testy father, And chide you from my roof! Mendoza. O pardon me, I will but seal one vow of tender friendship On this fair hand, and instantly attend you.â Farewell!âThou art the loveliest work of Heaven, And may its purest spirits be thy guard! [Exit, with the Governor. Marcella. Torn from me! banish'd from my view for ever! O, shall these wretched eyes behold no more The darling of their sight! and as each morn Of hated life returns, shall they be forc'd To gaze upon the object that they loath? Sure all the subtlest of the infernal fiends Are leagu'd to curse me with their keenest tortures. Ah, senseless wretch! my folly is the fiend From whom this misery springs: 'twas I, 'twas I, Slave that I was! who fasten'd on myself This iron bondage that corrodes my soul. Hernandez (entering.) Lament its weight no more! thy chain is broken. Receive the symbol of thy liberty! [Delivering the ring. Marcella. It is my ring! my gladden'd eyes acknowledge Its bright assurance of recover'd freedom!â Fly, stop Mendoza!âStay! yet tell me first How thou hast prosper'd, thou excelling servant!â Thou shalt have great rewards, great as my joy!â How did the fond Lupercio yield my pledge? Haste! tell me allâI must prepare myself To meet him soon, complaining of his loss. Hernandez. Be satisfied!âHe can no more complain. Marcella. What dost thou mean by that mysterious accent? Hernandez. His hated voice shall ne'er be heard again. Marcella. Thou hast not murder'd him!âBy Heaven thou hast; I read it in thy dark and troubled visage. Hernandez. I have indeed been bloody for thy sake. Marcella. Is he then butcher'd by thy savage hand?â Unhappy youth! thy pale and gory spectre Will glare for ever in my sight, and banish All hopes of quiet from my soul for ever.â Wretch! thou hast sunk me in the deepest gulph Of horror and perdition. Hernandez. Come, be chear'd! I have deliver'd thee from him, whose being Was torture to thy heart.âLupercio's dead; And by my caution it must be suppos'd The nightly robbers, who infest our city, Have thus reveng'd his vigilance against them. Marcella. Is this the recompence of all thy merit, Brave, gen'rous, frank Lupercio?âTho' my heart Recoil'd perversely from thy love, it feels, With cold convulsive pangs of vain regret, It feels thy worth, thy ill-requited virtues, And all the horrors of thy barb'rous fate. Hernandez. Reflect thou only from what hated scenes Of hopeless pain my daring hand has sav'd thee! Think what thou ow'st to me, who for thy sake Have put in hazard my immortal foul! Marcella. Ill-fated wretch! thou also hast my pity. 'Twas my base conduct, blinded as I was, That plung'd thee in this guilt.âBut haste! be gone! Fly! while thou canst, where justice may not find thee. Fly to some distant climate; and endeavour, By penitence, to make thy peace with Heaven! Go where thou wilt, my bounty shall attend thee, And aid thee with such lavish sums of gold, As may enable thee, by those good deeds Which charity delights in, best to cancel Or counterpoise the evil of thy crime. Hernandez. What! canst thou vainly think, that in thy service I've dy'd my unstain'd hand in guiltless blood For gold! the needy robber's paltry prey? Marcella. What was thy aim?âthy frantic eyes affright me! Hernandez. Here is the nobler recompence I claim, Thy beauty! rich in medicinal balm To heal th'envenom'd anguish of remorse. Come to my breast! and with thy melting charms Drown all the keenest pangs, that guilt can waken, In extacy more poignant! Marcella. Slave! unhand me!â Away! remember, rash, presumptuous villain! The distance of thy station! Hernandez. Idle pride! Silence its frivolous and false suggestion! The hours just past have plac'd us on a level. Thou hast no title now, but Murderess. We are confederates in guilt and blood: Blood is the cement of our equal union. Marcella. Thou dar'st not say it. Hernandez. Dive into thy bosom! Ask thy own heart!âDidst thou not wish his death? Aye! had thy flaming eyes, like basilisks, Been arm'd with sudden power to strike him dead, Their stroke had far outstripp'd my tardy dagger. Thou couldst not think thy lover would resign The gem, thou bad'st me pilfer, but with life. Marcella. No! witness Heaven! I thought not of his death.â Yet thou hast rent a veil of fatal passion, That hid my own soul from me; and I see The stains of misery and guilt are on it. I am indeed the source, the wretched source Of all this scene of horror: 'tis to me, To me, thou ill-starr'd minister of mischief, Thou ow'st the burden of this bloody deed, Which cries to angry Heaven for retribution.â Now, I conjure thee, raise again thy arm! Plunge thy yet-reeking poniard in my heart, And by this justice expiate our crimes! Hernandez. Away with vain remorse!âCome! let me steep Thy troubled senses in those soft delights, That sweetly steal from the enchanted soul All memory of pain! Marcella. Delight from thee! Hernandez. I find, contemptuous fair-one! I am not Thy fav'rite! No! thy nice fastidious eye Delights in daintier forms. My jealous passion Has caught thy bosom's secret.âYet be grateful, Be wise! and I will make thee soon the bride Of thy belov'd Mendoza. Marcella. Canst thou mean it? Hernandez. Yes! with this fine-form'd heir of wealth and grandeur, Soon shalt thou shine in all that blaze of fortune Which suits thy towering spirit, if thy beauties Will pay their debt of gratitude to me, And with those sweet delights, that stealth makes sweeter, Reward the secret author of thy greatness. Marcella. What! be the wife of Honour's noblest son, And live the servile strumpet of my vassal!â Presumptuous villainy!âUnhand me, ruffian! Hernandez. Nay! struggle not!âI have thee in my toils, And my keen love shall feast upon its victim, O'ertaken with such hazard.âCome! be gentler! Marcella. Never! O never! Hernandez. Must I owe to force The joy thy pitying gratitude should give? The joy for which my ardent soul has thirsted, E'en to its own perdition? Marcella. Hence! away!â Release my hand, or my distracted cries Shall bring my injur'd father to my aid. Hernandez. And dar'st thou threaten me, ungrateful girl? But it shall not avail thee.âHear, and tremble At the superior threat thou mak'st me utter!â Thou see'st, by all the bloody business past, I hold my life as nothing: if thou still Deny'st me, what I have so dearly purchas'd, I will, before our magistrates I will Avow the murder, charge upon thy head The black design, and add, I have receiv'd Thy virgin treasure as my settled hire; But that remorse has drawn the secret from me.â Now learn to threaten, girl!âNow take thy choice! Shame! public shame, with tortures and with death, Or the safe sweets of privacy and joy! Marcella. Amazement! thy ferocity in guilt O'erwhelms my faculties.âYet hear me, Heaven! To thee, altho' offended by my falshood, To thee I kneel: O punish my offences By any pangs thy justice may ordain, But save! O save me from this daring wretch! Hernandez. Thy prayer's too late, since thou hast render'd me The wretch I am: thy passions made me guilty, And thou shalt yield me that reward of guilt For which I burn in every vein to madness!â Come, my reluctant fair-one! Marcella. No! by Heaven! Fulfil thy horrid, thy inhuman threats! Add perjury to murder! and devote me To infamy and death!âI will embrace them, Rather than yield to thy abhorr'd suggestion, And in that fellowship debase my soul. Hernandez. Is there such firmness in the heart of woman? Then artifice assit me! (Aside.)âMatchless virtue! E'en in this frenzy of my tortur'd spirit I feel thy awful power!âThy purity Irradiates the dark chaos of my mind, And all the warring fires of lawless passion Turn at thy voice to penitential tears!â I kneel to thee for pardon. Marcella. Bend to Heaven! 'Tis Heaven who strikes thee, to reclaim thy soul, With just compunction. Hernandez. Thou benignant angel! On thee depends my safety or perdition; Treat me with soothing pity and forgiveness, And I may yet atone for all my crimes, The fatal offspring of distracted passion! Marcella. Thou hast my pity. Hernandez. I will ask no more; I will not wound thy dignity, by wishing What madness only led my heart to sigh for. No! fair Perfection! live thou many years In the chaste bliss of honourable love! While I, the victim of a frantic fondness, In some wild desert hide my loath'd existence, Mourn my past guilt, and hope the pitying vows Of innocence like thine, may draw from Heaven A full, tho' late forgiveness of my crimes. Marcella. Unhappy servant! in my prayers for mercy Thou ne'er shalt be forgotten. Hernandez. 'Tis my purpose To fly from hence before to-morrow's dawn: But wherefore? I nor wish, nor merit life.â Haste to thy injur'd father! let him know The wretch he harbours! and for all my guilt Let public justice make her full atonement! Marcella. Poor frantic criminal! yet hope in Heaven! I, who have blindly led thee into crimes, Will not accelerate thy punishment. Seek some religious cell, and meditate On the infinitude of heavenly mercy! Hernandez. I see, I feel it in thy soothing pity! Marcella. Here meet me once again, some two hours hence; I will supply thee with such gold or jewels As may give comfort to thy lengthen'd days. Hernandez. Thou art too good, too tender to a villain, Who has deserv'd thy hatred and thy scorn.â Still let me strive to shew I have a heart That knows to value what it cannot merit. I will not meet thee. We'll converse no more, Lest when my flight is known, some dark suspicion Fall on thy innocence.âAt evening's close Leave thou the gift, thy charity intends, In the lone tower, that flanks the garden wall. At midnight I will take thy bounty thence, And, praying for thy peace, depart for ever. Marcella. I thank thy generous caution; nor will fail To bring thee liberal aid: for still, I trust, 'Tis Heaven's intent, for all thy earlier virtues, By years of calm sequester'd penitence To purify thy soul, and seal thy pardon. Cherish that thought! and Mercy be thy guard! [Exit. Hernandez (alone.) 'Tis wellâProud Beauty! I am now thy master: Thy haughty spirit, that no threats could tame, Sinks unsuspecting in the smooth deception That artifice has spread.âIn that lone tower, Where the coy clamours of a feign'd aversion Will only prove a prelude to my joy, I'll lurk to seize thy charms.âNow hasten, Night! Thy kind companions, Solitude and Darkness, Shall o'er this froward fair-one aid my triumph, And sate insulted love with sweet revenge. End of ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Hernandez (alone.) Victorious passion! thou at length hast gain'd The prize, that long has kindled in my soul Such wild tumultuous hopes and madding wishes! Thy secret joys are safe.âSpite of the frenzy, Rais'd by her wounded pride and vain resistance, This coy one, stifling her vindictive rage, Most wisely hides the mysteries of the night; And from her silence in this hasty marriage, My triumph is complete: she now will grow The willing vassal of my private pleasure. But hark! I hear the doating bridegroom's voice: He moves this way.âI would not he should cast His keen eyes on me, till my harrass'd spirit Regain its wonted firmness.âI'll avoid him. [Exit. Enter the Governor and Mendoza. Governor. Indeed, my son, I've yielded much too far To the fond zeal of your intemperate love. How will the world upbraid me, for allowing Your hurried nuptials, in this ill-starr'd hour Of doubtful horrors, your unhappy bride Or drown'd in tears, or almost craz'd with terror! And the brave youth, her late affianc'd lord, My poor ill-fated friend, welt'ring in blood, From the base wounds of undetected murder! Mendoza. My honour'd father, thou hast only done What tenderness and duty both enjoin'd. Her generous wish to be my wedded love, Her virtuous dread that honour might forbid it, And the dire fate of that lamented youth, Whom she both loath'd and pitied, all combin'd, Had cruelly depriv'd her troubled senses Of reason's sovereign guidance; still on me The lovely maniac rav'd; implor'd my aid To save her from Lupercio's nuptial claim, And chase the gory phantom from her sight, Which frenzy rais'd before it:âwhat remain'd, But for Mendoza, urg'd by love and pity, To take the dear distrest one to his bosom, Bear her from hence, and in more tranquil scenes Heal her distemper'd mind, and fondly cherish The gentle sufferer into peace and joy? Governor. Heaven bless the generous fervor of thy fondness, Thou noble-minded youth!âI had not power To thwart thy wish, tho' my paternal heart, Trembling in its completion, still endures Painful vicissitudes of hope and fear. Mendoza. Doubt not, my father, lenient time and love, That mutual love which consecrates our union, Will from the harrass'd spirit of thy daughter Remove this load of complicated anguish, And make us soon the happiest pair that ever Reach'd the pure summit of connubial bliss. Governor. I know she loves thee to a fond excess; Her soul was form'd for love: and thou art blest, Most richly blest, with all that can enchant The eye or heart of woman:âon this ground I build my strongest hope. Yet O, my son, Weak as she is, her senses scarce restor'd, How can I yield this darling from my sight, E'en to a guard so tender? Mendoza. Speak your pleasure! If 'tis your wish, we will remain your guests. But change of place will sooth the harrass'd mind Of our sweet sufferer. She should quit this scene, While, in avenging the brave murder'd youth, You nobly pay your great and awful debt To private friendship and to public justice. Governor. I have no doubts on that atrocious deed.â My poor lost friend's incautious ardent spirit Had fatally provok'd some desperate villains Who lurk within our city: the base wretches Have thus reveng'd a menace, which Lupercio Pronounc'd against their chief;âbut by my orders We soon shall see the bloody slaves secur'd. A care still heavier presses on my heart, My poor perturbed child!âMy anxious love Wavers in painful doubt, nor can resolve To speed her hence, or to detain her here. Mendoza. Submit it to her choice!âSoon as the priest Ended our hasty and affecting marriage, You know she begg'd permission to retire, To gain by solitude reviving strength, And still those throbs of lovely agitation, Which in the solemn rite subdu'd her softness. Go to her chamber, your paternal care May best explore her wishes: let them be Our guides in every step!âFor me, I hold My fortune and my life but ministers Bound to fulfil our dearest mutual hope, And make the bliss of your angelic daughter As perfect as her beauty. Governor. Noble youth! A father's tears must thank thee.âI will follow Thy generous counsel, and return to bless thee. [Exit. Mendoza. How mighty is thy power, Parental Love! The hardy sinews of this gallant veteran, Proof 'gainst the weight of war's severest toils, Yield to thy pressure.âThat undaunted firmness, Which peril could not shake, is turn'd by thee To wavering fear and fond irresolution. Enter Lopez. Lopez. My honour'd lord, forgive me, if my zeal Urge me to trouble you with painful truths! Mendoza. What wouldst thou, Lopez?âHence with idle preface, And speak thy meaning boldly! Lopez. 'Tis my duty That forces from my lips, at such a season, What I must grieve to speak, and you to hear. Mendoza. Well, thou hast credit for thy good intention, Spare thy apologies, and tell thy tale! Lopez. 'Tis thus, my lordâbut promise me your pardonâ Mendoza. I'll pardon any thing but thy suspence. Lopez. Know then, the steward of this house, Hernandez, Has been observ'd to throw his daring arms With such licentious freedom round your bride, As honour cannot brook. Mendoza. Good simple fellow! Is this thy wondrous tale? thy painful truth? What! art thou yet to learn, that antient servants Are amply privileg'd on days like this? The man who bore the infant in his arms May kiss the ripen'd bride without a crime, And the quick eye of jealousy itself Shall wink at his presumption.âGet thee gone! Lopez. He boasts he will attend you to Madrid; Says he is fix'd for life my lady's usher, Defying e'en her husband to displace him. Mendoza. I will not quarrel with his honest pride, Inebriate with joy;âyet as the world Is prone to censure, 'twill perhaps be prudent To strike this boasting vassal from our train: But that hereafter.âHence! my father comesâ Yet, Lopez, stayâone word with thee alone. [Exit with Lopez. Enter the Governor and Marcella. Marcella. Think not, thou kindest parent that e'er drew From the fond eyes of a protected child. The tears of filial gratitude, think not Thy daughter thankless for thy guardian care From her impatient haste to quit thy mansion! Governor. No! my sweet child! I know thy heart too well To doubt its tenderness. Trust me, thy father, Much as he joys to have thee in his sight, Feels in these moments all the forceful reasons That urge thy quick departure. Marcella. Then farewell To this paternal roof! Ye walls, that echoed With the gay music of my infant songs, Farewell! If aught of evil hover o'er ye, May it depart with me! depart for ever! Safety and honour, pure celestial guards, Watch o'er this dome! and bless its dear possessor!â Hear this my parting prayer, indulgent Heaven! Whate'er thy pleasure may ordain for me, Here or hereafter, grant, O grant me this, To die before my father can have cause To wish he were not author of my being! Governor. Live but till then, and thou must be immortal!â Rise, my kind daughter!âThou wilt ever prove My age's darling; dearer to thy father Than life or glory. Heaven, I trust, for thee Has years in store of still encreasing joy. Marcella. Alas! my father, dost thou not perceive The poor Lupercio whispering from his shroud How short and how precarious mortal being! If soon thou chance to hear thy child is dead, And his shade tells me thou wilt hear it soon, I pray thee let not an intemperate grief Bend to the earth thy venerable age. Yet O forget me not! with tender sorrow Give thy pure prayers to my departed soul! Governor. Rise, rise, my child!âLet not these gloomy fancies O'ercloud thy chearful spirit! raise thine eyes To all the radiant paths of varied pleasure That open now before thee!âSee thy lord, The bright conductor of thy future steps, Comes, like the sun new-risen, to disperse These noxious vapours from thy darken'd mind, And give thy charms new lustre! Enter Mendoza. Governor. Dear Mendoza, We will from hence to-day: I will myself Play the young soldier, and escort your bride Across this province. Mendoza. Blest the travellers, Whose road is shorten'd by so dear a guide! Governor. Raise thou that drooping lily, while I go And issue orders for our quick departure. [Exit. Mendoza. Come to my arms, thou sweet seraphic being! Come, and preside o'er all my future life, As a benignant angel, by whose guidance I wish to regulate my every thought!â Bless that kind tear! it is the sweet reply Of tenderness too delicate for language.â Yet speak, Marcellaâmy delighted ear Doats on the music of thy soothing voice. Marcella. O had I but the power to make thee happy! Were it but possible, thy life should prove Unclouded, as thy virtues and thy love! Mendoza. In thee I've every blessing man can wish. My conscious pride, exulting in thy love, Boldly defies the wantonness of fancy To figure joys above th'unchequer'd bliss Which my full heart has found in thy perfection. Be thou as happy as thou mak'st Mendoza, And we shall live the envy of the world.â Why gush these tears? Why heaves thy lab'ring bosom? Why roves thy troubled eye around the chamber, Seeming to parley with the senseless walls?â My tender fair-one! I perceive thy thoughts: This is the fond adieu which thy soft spirit Expresses to this dear paternal mansion. Be chear'd! thou soon shalt visit it again, When its glad gates shall leap at thy approach, And ev'ry echoing stone repeat thy welcome.â Still pensive!âCome, sweet partner of my life! Prepare we for our travels.âHave your women Receiv'd their orders? Pray, ere we depart, Inform Hernandez we will not deprive His generous master of so tried a servant! Tell him he must not quit his post. Marcella. I dare not. Mendoza. How! dare not, didst thou say? What! dare not utter A just direction to an antient vassal? Marcella. He is the master of a fatal secret, I dare not drive him to reveal. Mendoza. A secret! Hast thou a secret thou canst wish to hide From the fond eye of all-forgiving love? Marcella. I have:âfor thee, thou darling of my soul, And for my father's peace, I strongly wish'd To bear it with me to an early grave, And hide its painful horrors in the shade Of hasten'd death:âbut, like the inbred fire, That burns its passage thro' the groaning earth, Struggling, it bursts from my convulsive bosom, And all the blazing ruin rushes on thee. Mendoza. Amazement!âThou hast petrified my heart: Yet speak! whatever wretchedness awaits me, I wish to hear it from no lips but thine. Marcella. Thou generous object of my fatal love!â Wretch as I am, how shall I bear the pangs, The keener pangs, I'm destin'd to inflict On the pure heart I wish'd to make most happy? Ill-starr'd Mendoza! dear, deluded youth! Thou fondly think'st thou'st taken to thy bosom A spotless form of purity and truth; But oh! 'tis stain'd by complicated crimes, Too horrible for utterance. Mendoza. Can it be? Who but thyself should call thee base, and live? Thou canst not be so: yet, I pray thee, speak The dreadful purport lab'ring on thy lips! Marcella. By Heaven I cannot! anguish, shame, remorse Stifle my words.âHere let me fall before thee! In pity both to me and to thyself Kill the vile wretch thus groveling at thy feet, Before her guilty tale shall freeze thy blood. Mendoza. Rise, thou dear suff'rer; I conjure thee speakâ No words, how horrible soe'er their import, Can torture more than this soul-harrowing silence. Marcella. Lupercioâ Mendoza. What!âThou knew'st not of his murder! Marcella. Hernandezâ Mendoza. Ha! was he the black assassin? Marcella. I did not place the poniard in his hand; I did not ask for blood: but my base falshood, Falshood the offspring of my love to thee, Led to that bloody deed. Mendoza. My bride a murd'ress! Marcella. Look not upon me thus! I cannot bear The fierce abhorrence of those angry eyes. Plunge thy sword here, and give me gentler death! Mendoza. Thou canst not be so guilty. Thou hast injur'd Thy own soft heart.âUnfold the fatal story. Marcella. Thou'rt yet to hear accumulated horrors, To make me still more loathsome to thy sight: But I can never speak them.âKill me! kill me! In mercy end my miseries, before The lightning of my father's indignation Strikes his detested daughter into dust. Mendoza. Would I could save him from the pangs I feel! But 'tis impossible, if thou art guilty. Marcella. It is, it isâthen save me from his wrath! Save my departing spirit from his curse, And death may then atone for my offences. I only wish to die by that dear hand; For oh! Mendoza, had not my fond heart Doated upon thee with unbounded love, We ne'er had known this miserable hour. Mendoza. 'Tis true, thou lovely criminal!âO Heaven! Why was she fram'd with such pernicious beauty?â I dare not trust myself to gaze upon thee In this wild tumult of my madd'ning soul.â Rest in this chamber, and restrain thy tears, While I regain some little use of reason, To hear more calmly all thy wretched tale. [He leads Marcella weeping to the adjoining chamber, and closes the door upon her. Mendoza. What's to be done? my dizzy soul, thus falling From joy's bright summit to these depths of horror, Loses the faculty of thought.âHere, Lopez! Go! bring Hernandez instantly before me! Enter the Governor. My father! are you come? I wish'd your presence, Yet I would freely part with life, to save you From the dread scene we must sustain together. Governor. What means Mendoza?âwhence thy alter'd visage?â What new affliction?âwhere's my hapless child? Mendoza. Thou brave, thou good, affectionate old man, It wounds my soul to tell thee, that thy roof Harbours the murderer thy justice seeks. Behold, he comes to answer for his crime! [Lopez and other Servants bring in Hernandez. Governor. Hernandez!âArt thou certain of his guilt? Or whence is thy surmise? Mendoza. Hear and decide!â Thou faithless servant, who hast stain'd a life Of long integrity by one black deed, I charge thee with the blood of that brave youth Thy master call'd his friend.âSay! art thou able To plead thy innocence?âThou need'st not speak; Thy guilty features answer thy accuser. Hernandez (aside.) The trait'ress has betray'd me: then, revenge, Thou art the only sweet that I can taste, And I will banquet on thee. Governor. If thou art So base a monster of ingratitude, Prepare thyself for tortures. Hernandez. Spare thy threats, Thou know'st not yet the partner of my guilt:â Thou wouldst not chuse to see thy daughter's beauty Expos'd a mangled victim in those streets, Where never eye survey'd her passing form But with delight or envy! Governor. Sland'rous ruffian! Dar'st thou prophane the virtue of my child?â But her pure soul could no more league with thine, Than Heaven's most favor'd angel could descend To aid the hellish plots of that arch fiend Who prompted thee to perpetrate this murder. Mendoza (aside to Hernandez.) Peace, villain! and if e'er thou hop'st for mercy, Respect the feelings of a wounded father! Hernandez. Talk not to me of mercyâI despise it.â Death is, I know, my portion; but its pangs Are turn'd to transport by my rich revenge. Too long the jests of mockery were lavish'd On my mishapen form and ardent love. One gibing youth has paid me with his life, For insolent derision; and o'er thee, Thou haughty husband, thou fair golden image, Whom beauty worships unconstrain'd, o'er thee My triumph rises to a prouder height Of bold revengeâI have enjoy'd thy bride. Mendoza. Thou blood-stain'd lyar, hence!âAway with him To strict confinement in your deepest dungeon! Hernandez. Bite thy proud frantic lip, in savage hope To see my crooked body on the wheel Crush'd, and expos'd a public spectacle! My vengeance is consummate; but for thine, 'Tis the vain menace of presumptuous pride, Which courage laughs at:âI escape it thus. [Stabs himself. Mendoza. Thou hast indeed eluded the slow hand Of human justice, but thou canst not foil The surer vengeance of high-judging Heaven. Governor. Go! bring thy wife! she must appear this instant. The form of injur'd innocence must draw From the pale lips of this expiring villain Th'avowal of his falshood. Hernandez. My dim eyes Are closing, and in this deceitful world Shall look no more upon her fatal beauty: But in the nextâO mercy! [Dies. Governor. Where is my daughter? Marcella (entering.) Here's the hapless being, Who once was proud of that endearing name: Tho' fallen, less guilty than the world might judge me, From the base insult of this bleeding wretch, Whose crimes are clos'd by death; yet O! my father, Too vile to claim thy kindness, or to live. Governor. Wrong not thyself! thou art all innocence. Marcella. Thou dear, deluded parentâ'twas my wish To die, and not deprive thee of a thought, In which thy virtuous spirit would have found Sweet consolation for thy lost delightâ I wish'd a little longer to support This wretched being, that I might not stain, By my accelerated fate, this mansion, The dear asylum of thy honour'd age! But my gall'd spirit, never form'd to bear The heavy load of unacknowledg'd guilt, Sunk in its painful efforts to sustain it. Hence the quick end of that abhorr'd assassin! And hence thy child, atoning now by death For her conceal'd offences, thus implores thee To pardon, and to bless her parting spirit! Governor. O thou dear sufferer! whate'er thy failings, Attempt not aught against thy precious life! Mendoza. Live, I conjure thee, and the tears of love Shall wash th'ideal blemish from thy heart. Marcella. My generous husband! let me speak that name, Still precious to me, tho' so rashly purchas'd! Think not thy injur'd bride design'd to give To thy chaste bed a vile dishonour'd partner, Tho' forcibly dishonour'd! Governor. Ha, my child! Hast thou endur'd from that atrocious ruffianâ Marcella. O good my father, ask not my faint voice, Which soon will sink in everlasting silence, T'unfold a tale, whose utterance would call Shame's burning blush to the pale cheek of death.â A friendly poison has already numb'd My vital faculties, but I have left A written legacy of fatal fondness, In which, unless my blotting tears have marr'd it, You'll read what I have done, and what endur'd.â Nay, weep not! both of you may love me dead, Living you could not. Mendoza. Could affection rescue Thy beauty from the grave, thou shoud'st not die. Marcella. I know, ye generous spirits, death will cancel In your kind mem'ries all my fatal errors: And hence its pangs are welcome.âOne base purpose Produc'd these scenes of unexpected horror; But Heaven has will'd that crime should quicken crime, To shew the danger of one devious step From the clear paths of probity and truth.â My dear Mendoza! thou wilt not deny me The title of thy wife to grace my tomb, And I shall sleep in peace.âConsole my father, And let him find in thee a worthier child! I had a heart to reverence his virtues, But not the strength to imitate.âO Heaven! [Dies. Mendoza. 'Tis gone! 'tis fled! the proud, the lovely soul, That could not brook the shadow of dishonour! Thy monument shall be the nuptial bed On which Mendoza will recline, and breathe His faithful fondness to thy list'ning spirit. Nor will I slight the dear and hallow'd trust, Bequeath'd by filial piety, to shield With constant care thy father's honour'd age.â Unhappy father! round the livid breast Of his lost child in speechless agony His arms are riveted!âAid me to raise, And bear him gently from this scene of death!</field>
