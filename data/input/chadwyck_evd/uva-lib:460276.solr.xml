      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGUMENT. The design is taken from the Interlude in Hamlet, in which, by the help of a set of Strolling Actors, are related some serious Truths. The audience is suppos'd to consist chiefly of True Britons—to whom the heavy burden of national debt is shewn in the Number of the Taxes, which are introduc'd, and PERSONATED to give more strength and life to the relation.—A Scheme for redress is proposed by a WORTHY Patriot—meets with encouragement —great blessings expected from it.—Thoughts upon civil government occasionally interspersed.—The scheme is suspected by those, who have the Taxes mortgag'd to them, to be levelled against such practises.—They and their confederates contrive a plot to undermine it, by representing all Patriots as Jacobites.—The plot too stale and trifling to be regarded—the Patriot Scheme succeeds—the True Old Constitution is restored, &amp;c.— the new measures put a stop to all complaints—and the whole body of the people becomes reconciled to the Administration.—Song—and Dance.—</field>

Sir JONATHAN JOLLY, a Country Gentleman. SAMPSON, Stockjobber. GRIPE, Stockjobber. TRANSFER, Stockjobber. Mr. BAYES, the Manager. The TAXES, properly distinguished.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Malt-Tax, Gin, Usquebaugh, Cyder-Tax, Mead, Beer, Ale, Metheglin, Perry, Mum, Soap, Candles, Starch, Leather, Coffee, Tea, Chocolate, Paper, Pastboard, Callicoes, Gilt and Silver Wire, Vellum, Parchment, Silver Plate, Window-Tax, Coach-Tax, Land-Tax, Hop-Tax, Glass-Tax, Stain'd and Died Stuffs, Silk, Linnen, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Preceded by Mr. Salt-Tax beating a March upon his Box. Mr. BAYES. [Meeting them] Mrs Mead, I am very glad to see you—Mrs. Hop, this is very obliging— Mr. Candle-Tax, you are a man of your word—Gentlemen— I thank you: I suppose you are all here!— But—What—[pausing, and holding up his hands] A good—round—hopeful tribe, upon my honour!—[as they are still crouding in]—Nay— nay—if there are still more of you—we shall certainly want room—I own I should have consider'd things a little better!—But who could have thought, I should have been so much out in my reckoning—when 'tis matter of fact, that we have frequently had two armies introduced upon this very spot—and yet now I can't say but what I begin to question, whether or no, they had so many men in them.—What!— Still crouding in—Nay then—However let us see as many of you as we can, gentlemen,—Too many!—too many, truly!—But I am obliged to you for your giving me this meeting. I thought it necessary you should make your appearance here in propriis personis—[advancing towards Mr. Salt-Tax] —If I don't mistake, I think your name is Salt-Tax— SALT-TAX. You are perfectly right, sir,—I came according to your order, and I hope not out of season. Mr. BAYES. No—no—quite apropòs—I introduce you first out of compliment to the audience, to give some relish to the action: for in this evening's entertainment I would have nothing insipid!— Things of this nature, Mr. Salt-Tax, ought to shew something of taste— SALT-TAX. Ah! Mr. Bayes, you know I love a joke, as well as any man living: But [shaking his head] these are but poor times for jesting—I am confident, you can be no stranger to what the most industrious set of men in the kingdom suffer, thro' the burdens laid upon my shoulders—I must say— I look'd upon myself to have a natural exemption from any fresh impositions. But—tho' my claim is so obvious—you see 'tis over-rul'd,—and I can't conceive how to account for't—unless it is, because I am so remarkably fix'd in the Country Interest; or rather, because I am look'd upon by the Courtiers—to be tooth and nail an enemy from the very soul of me to all Corruption. Mr. BAYES. Come—come—my good friend, this may turn out a better day than you think for—But as I have a great deal of business upon my hands, I must beg your pardon for the present—I should be extremely glad to have a little more conversation with you at another time—But your neighbour there will have reason to take it amiss, unless I just ask him how he does. Well—Mr. Malt-Tax —This is extremely obliging, to let me see you this morning.—I don't know how it is— but I find every body here is complaining of the badness of the times! MALT-TAX. And not without reason!—You know, Maister Bayes—I am a plain spoken man,—and as I have the proverb o'my side, in good liquor there is truth, you may believe me when I tell you, these times are brewing no good for us— Nay for that matter, 'tis not myself alone (for I don't speak out of self-interest) but there are all my relations great sufferers!—There's my Cousin Hop there! poor soul, that can't stand a high-lone without the help of a stick, and consequently ought to be look'd upon as an object of charity, (O terrible times!) must now pay for herself by the pound!—Why, Mr. Bayes—this is a most bitter tax—and tho' one of our family has still some spirits left, my relation Mrs. Gin yonder, yet—she has a heavy reckoning to pay— But—Mum!—is all I say—Silence can bring a man into no scrapes!— Mr. BAYES. What is that your Cousin Gin there?—Your servant, madam; I ask pardon for taking these freedoms with you—But I hope your cask is out at present, 'twill be highly necessary for me to take some care of my Dram-atis Personæ. Mrs. GIN. I assure you, Mr. Bayes, I have not a drop left—and I begin to be so sensible of the mischief I have done in the world, that I believe I shall soon leave off trade; my conscience will never let me carry on business much longer. Mr. BAYES. So much the better—'tis a sad thing to be accessary to the destruction of such numbers of People —But—[advancing to Mr. Cyder-Tax] I must beg leave to pay my compliments to my good friend here.—Well—Mr. Cyder-Tax, what news have we in our good county of Hereford? CYDER-TAX. Why there is a core Mr. Bayes—there is a core that sticks in every honest man's stomach.— These home-impositions break our backs—They impair us—They dry up the juices of our constitution. —Lay what you will upon our foreign commodities; but let our own manufactures escape a reckoning—I could be as patient as any man to take (as the saying is) the rough with the smooth— But to let such good subjects as we are, meet with nothing but rough usage, 'tis treating us ill, Mr. Bayes, 'tis graffing a crab upon a redstreak— Mr. BAYES. Come, come, never mind what's past—I tell you the times are growing better.—But—[advancing to Mr. Window-Tax] is not that Mr. Window-Tax? I must just speak to him—What —Jack—is that patch over your eye a policy of thine to save a shilling— WINDOW-TAX. Why, Maister Bayes, it is but following the practice of the country, if I have stopp'd up half my lights—This is quite wrong. To make us pay for God's blessings, one should think, cou'd have never enter'd into any man's head, that must not have been a great worker in darkness; and if it is one of the works of darkness, there is no harm, I hope, in calling it a devilish Tax.—You'll own this is bad enough!—But every demand, it seems, that is now made, like a bell, is to take Toll back-stroke and fore-stroke— Why, Mr. Bayes, the very Glass pays as well as the Light!—I have often heard of persons paying for their peeping—and I think this is making out the proverb with a vengeance! Mr. BAYES. Well—Gentlemen I'm glad to find there is still left some spirit among you. I must tell you, 'tis a day of great business with me, and I can't conveniently stay to pay my compliments to every one of you in particular—but I shall see you again in the evening—and then I hope I shall be able to tell you some good news, that will well reward you for your waiting— [Exit Mr. Bayes, with the Taxes. SCENE II. A Study. Lord WORTHY alone—with a roll in his hand. LORD WORTHY. I could no longer hold!—My attempt at court Has found success that e'en exceeded hope! Our gracious princess, with a dumb attention, Whose silence gave me confidence of speech, As melted wax the seal, receiv'd my counsels— For as I stood with watchful eye remarking Th'affections, which my honest freedom rais'd, Pleas'd, I observ'd surprize and tenderness Catching her looks by turns—Once in her eye Glow'd red hot anger, which soft pity soon Melted to briny drops, that trickled down Her rosy—dewy cheek!—Another meeting Secures the wish'd-for point!—At ten this morning I'm promis'd farther hearing!—Thoughts deliver'd In th'airy garb of speech, make faint impressions. So!— This roll shall go with me!—I'll try to leave it!— 'Tis that in which I've taken care to state What our poor country suffers—this bulg'd vessel That cries for help in signals of distress. SCENE III. A Coffee-House. HEARTY and TRADEWELL, reading the papers. Enter Sir JONATHAN JOLLY. HEARTY. [Rising. Bless me if here is not Sir Jonathan Jolly— Hah! my good friend—How long have you been in town? SIR JONATHAN. I arrived yesterday—I call'd at your house, and they told me you was here.—Give me thy hand honest Tradewell—I am glad to see thee with all my heart— TRADEWELL. Indeed, this is an unexpected favour.—You wear special well Sir Jonathan. [They take their seats. Sir JONATHAN. You know, Tradewell, I was never one of those fellows, that suffer themselves to be eaten up by the hyp—About a month ago I had a little touch of the gout or so—but that's nothing—I am now got pretty stout again. TRADEWELL. Well—Have you heard the news?—I can tell you it has rais'd all our spirits—There's our princess has certainly sent for Lord Worthy to court, who has almost lost his own title in that of The True Briton, and you must own, he is a man, Sir Jonathan, that is not to be warp'd by any offers!— Sir JONATHAN. You know I was always a well-wisher to my country—and if Lord Worthy has taken those steps, I hope 'twill answer your expectation— But 'till I see the event, I shall beg leave to reserve my opinion.—As things have gone for some years past, who can answer for any man's character?—It must be a rare honesty indeed that can stand trial now-a-days—When those gentlemen, who in the country go by the name of patriots, once make their appearance at court, I look upon them, as old money call'd in to be new coin'd—Let them go in there with what face they will, you'll see them come out again with the court stamp—mill'd in the same manner—Faith there's no difference. TRADEWELL. Come, come, Sir Jonathan, you must not be so incredulous—We must give fruits time to ripen—We must have a little patience. Sir JONATHAN. Let me first see something good going forward and I'm contented.—But Jack Hearty, you are a great stranger in our parts—Are we never to crack another bottle together at Fudler's-Hall?— Come, come, leave this idle business of the town— honest folks have little to do here—and go back with me into the country—We'll hunt together this season—There's our Robin tells me, that last spring he turn'd out twenty cubs into the woods and the broad leazes.—Prithee, Jack, never plague thyself any longer with politicks—'tis a cursed dry study. HEARTY. But, my good friend! 'Tis only so when we mistake the science, And make it little better than the hawker Of flying rumour—There the error lies— Reports so gather'd alway come too late, Or fall too short to keep distress aloof— Believe me—these are not the arts t'instruct The citizen in duty—These require A deeper search into the state of things; 'Tis to set open the machine, and look Into the inside work of our connections, For harmony and order—is the science That nature points out to us, and to bring The subject on a level with our reach, From our own wond'rous mechanism, the lesson Of every day's familiarity, She proves t'our very senses, how each member Requires it's fellow's help, the less honour'd, Vying in use and operation With those of subtler make!— A case, tho' to sight obvious, yet o'erlook'd Draws our neglecting it, to one o'th'extremes Of Pride, that lifts it's head too high, or Murmur, That grumbles inward, just as the lot falls, And our condition's lowly or advanc'd— Varying her key of speech, at other times To tune her compliments to sacred science, To which herself gave birth, the fitly-fram'd Well-order'd edifice discovers to us The model of community! Each part, From base to pinnacle, by contact close, Supporting and supported! Sir JONATHAN. Jack Hearty!—I don't deny but what all this sounds pretty enough—and may do well enough too in—speculation—But take my word for't, Old England is so degenerated! and the general turn of thinking so much alter'd, that I am afraid, you may talk of your bodies and your buildings, 'till your heart aches—and you'll be just such gainers, as I should be, were I to enter my broken-winded Flora, for one of the King's Plates!— The publick good is quite distanc'd—self-interest is all in all—Places, Jack, are tempting things— and your Pensions, let me tell you, are like hoods upon hawks—your staunch courtiers are kept in the dark—are never permitted to see any thing but the quarry they are to fly at—and as soon as they have done the work set them—the lure is thrown out—they come tamely to your hand, and the hood goes on again— TRADEWELL. Indeed—indeed, Sir Jonathan, you are too diffident—when our affairs are so apparently upon the mending hand—still to distrust is throwing a damp upon the publick joy— Sir JONATHAN. Well—well—we shall soon see how things will turn out.—I must say that for Lord Worthy, I never heard he had any taste for luxury!—He is no gambler—and the world never censured him for being avaritious—He has hitherto behaved himself with too much honour and generosity, to raise any suspicion that he is pursuing self-interested views.—I really take him to be an honest, sensible, clever fellow, and it must be allow'd, there's no one better acquainted with or constitution; so that faith, 'tis possible he may do great things, if he can fairly come at the ear of the Princess.—But what say you, gentlemen, to one evening at the Rummer?— Do you bring with you two or three of my old acquaintance, and I'll engage honest Tom Wishwell to give you the meeting. I am at present engag'd at the Cocoa-Tree, [pulling out his watch] and I see I shall but just save my distance— HEARTY. What say you, Tradewell, are you engaged to-morrow in the evening— TRADEWELL. No—I'll be with you, without fail— Sir JONATHAN. Then—to-morrow night I shall see you again— the sooner the better—but don't fail to bring some of my old friends with you; we shall be the merrier—well, your servant. [Exit Sir Jonathan. HEARTY. You see the old knight is as honest as ever— but you find you could not perfectly bring him over to your way of thinking, that we are going to CHANGE Measures, as well as Hands— and I can't say but his diffidence has partly made a convert of my opinion.—It is very certain, we are at a low ebb—if there was but one spark of the old English honour, rak'd up under the ashes, possible to be lighted up again—there might be some hopes.—Ah! Tradewell! when we have been so long accustomed, to have our characters and consciences treated as saleable commodities, where shall we find the spirit to resent such usage.—How would THIS have been taken by our ancestors?—Can a greater insult be offer'd?—and yet, you see, we have some men among us that take it—patiently!—I don't know how it is—but the offer of a Place or Pension, is instantly to palliate the affront—nay— to make the injury change shape with obligation— like the Mountebank's throwing a custard in his Merry Andrew's face, when the fellow turns round with a grin, licks his chops, and makes a leg for the favour. TRADEWELL. Believe me, Hearty, we have no reason to despair—my accounts may be depended on!— I have 'em from my state Barometer (as I call it) the countenance of our old friend Wishwell—which I have observ'd of late has stood at CHEARFUL— I have never known it fail in the course of a long acquaintance; you know he keeps up a good intelligence —weighs things well—and is cautious of delivering his opinion, 'till it has been assay'd by good authority—To tell you the truth, he has let me into a secret, which after I have seen him again, your ear will probably be no stranger to— I promis'd to call upon him this morning. HEARTY. You will oblige me then, if you'll let me see you in your return. TRADEWELL. You shall—I have a little business your way, and if you are going home I'll certainly call upon you— SCENE IV. An Apartment in the Palace. BRITANNIA sitting on a couch, leaning on her arm in a pensive posture. Enter Lord WORTHY. BRITANNIA. [Raising herself, and advancing towards him. My lord, your stay, tho' you are punctual, Has somewhat tried our patience—Ah my good lord Had not your counsels made such long delays Redress had made more haste— WORTHY. Most gracious liege, Past sufferings, like the deep shades in paintings, Will give a brighter glow to ripening blessings: Health leaving us awhile, quickens our joy, When 'tis recover'd to it's cherub-bloom: And wanton plenty meets a louder welcome After cold barrenness has for a time Lock'd up the womb of the earth, And mock'd the labourer's toil— But now the golden season's breaking out, And the discouragement, that nipp'd the hands Of Britain's genius with benumbing frost, Begins to melt, and the rich tide of industry Has leave to flow by the kind quick'ning warmth Of royal favour— BRITANNIA. Indeed our state too long Has groan'd beneath it's burden—but it's sufferings Having now reach'd our ear—our princely love, Like the sun's rays, should instantly be felt, And chear our people's hopes—THAT LIGHT of heav'n Is daily pointing in it's great example Our path of duty—we shou'd SHINE to BLESS. WORTHY. What else is glory? till it takes these measures, If possibly it catches vulgar eyes, 'Tis but a counterfeit, a tinsel lustre, That's only priz'd by ignorance of worth; A will-o-'wisp, that leads the mind to error, But neither lights—nor warms— Whereas true greatness, seeks to serve mankind, Stoops to the earth—and beams on distant objects— It's sphere is measur'd by the help it gives; In it's effects still present, and refulgent In ev'ry being, that's nourish'd by it's heat! BRITANNIA. And therefore, my good lord, with open heart (The Bondsman of our tongue) when we assur'd you At our last meeting, of our ready zeal Instant to probe the wound, and seek the cure Of our disorders—There's one general point, We can't recede from—We'll have no transfer books For grievances!—The scheme to gain our liking, Must seek the good of all—There's none shall suffer, But those who well deserve it—Widows, and orphans, Debarr'd their right, would like a blast from heaven, Cut off our budding hopes—Justice first answer'd, Shall warrant our proceedings—it shan't concern us, 'Mongst men of narrow souls, if murmur's tongue Treats us too freely— [Lord Worthy upon his knee, offering the roll to Britannia, which she accepts of. WORTHY. The roll here given your highness— Speaks your own thoughts—it seeks with tenderness T'apply the salve, nor has it thoughts t'offend Justice, or honour; nor seeks it to release The tribute, due to maintenance of greatness. 'Tis not to lessen, but encrease dependents; To make each member of the government, In peace it's advocate, in war it's soldier— 'Tis to dismantle falshood, to shew truth In it's pure spotless garment habited— Distinguish loyalty, from venal services— And spread a general joy, by placing worth In honour's seat, that's grown almost a stranger By being kept at distance, undermin'd By pale-fac'd envy's sculking artifice, Working like moles in th'earth, daubing the pasture On which they feed with dirty eminencies— BRITANNIA. My lord, we're satisfy'd—and will peruse The roll with close attention—in the mean time We would have swift-wing'd hope dispatch'd, to promise Some general blessing—to try how things will bear— 'Tis this should pave the way—for opposition Now grown unpopular will fall it's crest, When freedom's ray is rising— And like a bird of darkness, Will rather seek to sculk, and hide itself From the fair light, that blinds it— WORTHY. This also was my care—an air serene Now smooths the clouded brow—My appearance here Has open'd wonder's eye, and given a tongue To long-dejected hope, which smiling now Is variously employ'd in drawing schemes Of future greatness; yet with chaste distrust, Checking it's high presumption, humbly leaves, The plan, that calls our honour, from the darkness, In which it long has slept, with fuller confidence, To your own waking care, and watchful foresight, Waiting with gay impatience it's success. BRITANNIA. Enough, my lord, from this your plan left with us Of our New Building, trusting to your wisdom, We shall with all dispatch, erect our state, A rival, to the greatness it enjoy'd In former ages—Our love shall not defer it; We'll take it now t'our thoughts—but as reflection Is best alone; we would be left awhile— Should doubts arise we shall require your counsels. WORTHY. May heaven assist you. [Exeunt. SCENE V. A Parlour. HEARTY Writing.—Enter TRADEWELL. HEARTY. This is kind—have you seen Wishwell? TRADEWELL. I have— HEARTY. And well—what news?— TRADEWELL. He tells me 'tis confirm'd—that this good lord Has been again most graciously received, Keeps stedfast to his plan, and close pursues His honest purpose—and the general joy Proclaims success—no business else is talk'd of. Our gracious Princess and this worthy lord Alone engross all conversation: Meet whom you will in publick, with sweet accent, Denoting inward joy, the speech still turns On royal goodness, and on patriot love— One, taking you by th'hand, “Our debts, says he, “Whose overflowings long have laid us waste, “Now pent within their channels, shall no longer “Licence perfidious powers to take advantage!” With hope erect (the happy change of things Rend'ring all ranks familiar) another tells you, Unask'd, without the leave of an acquaintance, “Our british lyon has too long been passive, “To leap o'er sticks, and show ridiculous feats, “At the insulting orders of those states, “Which in the days of our great ancestors “Stood trembling at his roar!”— HEARTY. But, my good friend! Tho' these reports, like a reviving cordial, Have rais'd me up, all circumstances weigh'd Is not our case too desperate?—Let me ask you, It is not with design to throw a damp Upon the publick joy— But with such debts, almost to bankruptcy, Sunk as we are, pray how are we to raise Th'immense supplies our injured honour calls for? Staggering, with bending joints, beneath our burdens, How shall our shoulders bear a heavier load? TRADEWELL. Save us from being given up as pledges To griping usurers—we've love and duty (Still verdant underneath oppression's weight) That never have forsook us—we have these Still left with us!— To yield the loan, for honour and protection, Chearful as ever!—The stream t'our capitol Conveying our collections is not sought To be diverted, but the point that's wanted, Is how to cleanse the channel of it's filth, Root out the matted weeds that stop it's current With their foul feedings—to clear it of it's banks Of mud and rubbish, which now top the brink, And stop the labouring oar!— HEARTY. I see your purpose!—O! could this be practis'd, Our purse would gladly meet the calls of state, And in our rising joys past miseries Would all be soon forgot— TRADEWELL. You judge quite right— Supplies would in no sort be term'd a grievance, If those who are entrusted with their uses Observe the rule that nature gives them, To teach just application!—her full springs Flow down her hills unforc'd, trilling their way To the next stream, which swelling with the loan, To the full-fed river hollows out its course; Between whose shelving banks, they sail to th'ocean, Our watry bulwark, and from thence exhal'd By heat's attractive power, are drawn towards heaven To fill the clouds with fatness, watching occasion In their descent t'enrich our fields and pastures. HEARTY. Nature, 'tis true, has given us noble rules For civil life, were we dispos'd to follow 'em. TRADEWELL. This is lord Worthy's purpose.— HEARTY. May it prosper— To generous views kind heaven will grant success, 'Tis it's own work, which it delights to bless.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Mr. BAYES alone, walking in a musing posture. Mr. BAYES. Let me consider—a plot—why really it would be wond'rous odd to have a play without one—yes, yes—a plot will he highly necessary—we must have a plot!—and I'll take care there shall be one, such as it is, but I'll not be concerned in it myself: I am one in the country interest, and the redress of grievances shall meet with no interruptions from any plot of my hatching—and yet there shall be a plot, because 'twill shew some people in a true light, and can do us no hurt— for there's Lord Worthy has so distinguish'd and establish'd a character, that he has nothing to fear, let them play what tricks they will—and there's our Princess too, has too much goodness and spirit to be drawn aside, when she is once let into the true state of things—so let 'em plot it as they will, 'twill all come to nothing! However by letting 'em have some hopes, and then presently cutting them short off again, as their disappointment will be greater, so those who wish well to the state, will be the more rejoiced—wretches, who have liv'd so long upon the spoil of their country ought to be set in a true light—I know they are now at their wit's end, and have schemes of all sorts, upon the anvil—Lord Worthy's appearing at court, is a riddle they can't find out—and they are so divided in their opinions, how they are to manage it under these difficulties, that it sets 'em a quarrelling among themselves—One urges this— and another that—Like sailors without a compass, they know not were they are, nor how to steer,— quite out of their reckoning—I know some of our greatest stock-jobbers, are now in a room, by themselves at Jonathan's—I'll e'en send them old Politick —I have hinted to him already, that if he happens to call there, he may hear of some business —This Politick, you must know, was born and bred a plotmonger—the place has been in his family, ever since the conquest—it descends from father to son, like that of the Dimmocks, our famous champions, upon coronation days; 'tis true —he is a crafty old fox—but then he makes no great dispatch—He is one that takes time to think!— So that our business will be concluded, while he sits hammering, and consequently our carrying our point, when they least think of it, will be so much the more excellent—He is always plying here about 'change time, I'll e'en go find him out, and send him— [Exit. SCENE II. Jonathan's Coffee-House. SAMPSON, GRIPE, and TRANSFER, in a room by themselves. SAMPSON. Here's nothing but bad news!—I find 'tis true, This man has been at court—our faithful spy Met him in his return, and he reports, His chearful looks declar'd his scheme's success— What he's contriving there, 'tis time must shew— But 'tis agreed, our Princess asks his counsels, Admits him to her closet—He's already The peoples idol—as he passes by them 'Tis through a shower of blessings!—yet 'tis said, His looks retain that plain, and humble cast, As would persuade the love that follows him, (Which is his every act's interpreter,) The zeal that seeks their good, would spare their praises. GRIPE. I hear he's got a scheme to—mend the times! That is to say, to make 'em worse for us— He's a weak man to think on't—'Tis a work, I hope, beyond his skill—but—if you say The people's voice has join'd him—a general outcry May do some hurt— TRANSFER. And that's the case at present— The town, grown frantick, with this scheme of his, Treats us, indeed, but scurvily—have you heard Th'opprobrious names they give us? We're compar'd To flies, that bask, and fatten on corruption— We're call'd the sponges, that have drank too deep The dews, that should have water'd larger spots. Nay, what is worse, (the soul-mouth'd scandal, rising Still to a higher pitch) we're call'd, the feeders Of bloated bribery, sellers of state poison, Which, lurking in the blood, the nerves unbraces Of gallant resolution— GRIPE. Why, Mr. Transfer, this will bear an action— And Mr. Sampson, won't you join with me To sue such folks for slander?— SAMPSON. Mr. Gripe, We'll wave it for the present—Our business now Takes a more general scope—we first must search What this scheme is, before we are prepar'd To countermine it—therefore, let us each Disperse ourselves, and lye in rumour's way— Th'intelligence we meet with, will determine What we have more to do.— GRIPE. Yes, yes; come, let us be going.— [As they are going, they are met by Old Mr. Politick, who returns with them and they seat themselves.— OLD POLITICK. Your servant, gentlemen. GRIPE. O! Mr. Politick, your humble servant—you are the very man I was thinking of—I know it would be doing great injustice to your good intelligence, to suppose you are a stranger to these reports— that Lord Worthy—is—attempting— something—at court—so I sha'nt trouble you with that piece of news—but, to come to the point—why sir—we have some reason to be apprehensive, that here is a scheme going forward, to break in, (it seems) upon our business—come —come—we look upon you, as one of us— we have let you into all our secrets—and you must own, you have been a considerable gainer— But now, as you are an able and wise man, 'tis your turn to do us a piece of service—you must give us your advice.— POLITICK. What, gentlemen, I conceive you are afraid this Lord Worthy is going to sink your markets— phoo—phoo—phoo—what can he attempt against such money'd gentlemen as you are—I know there are some weak people, who dream of more influence than they have, and think themselves qualify'd to do great things—But let me tell you, to prescribe alterations in the present measures, at least, to do it with success, requires a better judgment than Lord Worthy's furnish'd with—there may be as wise heads in the world as his—But pray, have you learn'd any thing certain of what regulations he is driving at?— SAMPSON. No, Mr. Politick, he keeps his counsels lock'd up in the Princesses closet, their conferences together, are close and private; only, if we may credit the best accounts we can meet with, there's some black weather, rising from that quarter, that threatens us with a storm. POLITICK. I hear, indeed, that Lord Worthy has been graciously receiv'd by the Princess; I must say, this has not a good look—and, 'tis generally reported, that he is greatly beloved by the people—This is likewise a very bad circumstance!—He is a man, they say, that has no regard for his interest—the good of his country, and that of his fellow citizens, as he proudly calls the people, is the only object, he pretends, that puts him upon taking these measures —and, you know, there's no rightly managing a man of such principles—But, let me consider —a place!—could not we contrive to get a place for him?—No—a place would have no good effect upon him—But let me think—a new title —no—no—an offer of this kind would be thrown away upon him; because,'tis his constant declaration, that there is no honour, but in an honourable action—so I am afraid we must let him alone—there is, I say, no good to be done with one of his character.— GRIPE. So I find at last, his good character is to ruin us—but what—if he is so shallow, as not to mind his own interest, I do say he has no business to interfere with ours—let me tell you, Mr. Politick, whatever he may pretend to be—we are certainly much better friends to the government, than he is, or can be—This leads me to a thought —I ask pardon, for presuming to give directions to so wise a man as you are—But, suppose now, you was to write a pamphlet, in which you was to represent us, as the props, or, I think it would sound better, if you call'd us the Pillars of the state.— POLITICK. I thank you, Mr. Gripe, for that excellent hint, the thought may be work'd up to carry a good argument—and I'll take care to dress it in a proper light.— TRANSFER. But, Mr. Politick, whatever is proper to be done, must not be delay'd—this Lord Worthy, by all report, has a plaguy long head of his own, and this good character you have given him, may be apt to fix him in our Princesses good graces— this is what we must prevent—if possible—and if something is not instantly done, it may be too late to seek a remedy—Come—come—come— you must exert yourself—you must remember 'tis now or never.— POLITICK. Well, well, the business shall be done—I must say that for myself, I have met with as difficult jobs as this, which I have rubb'd through, before now; and so to make short of it, you shall soon see me play him such a trick!—that, if I have any judgment, must secure the game for you.— Let me see—as we are all friends, I'll let you into the secret—I'll now go this instant, and take care that it shall be publish'd, through city, town, and country,—that this Lord Worthy is an enemy to the government, an errant Jacobite. GRIPE. Right!—quite right! Mr. Politick!—a Jacobite! —an excellent contrivance!—He is endeavouring to make the times better! hah! hah! hah! —make the times better—we know what he means by better times.—a Jacobite! an excellent thought! —However, though we know he is perfectly innocent of the charge—yet this, Mr. Politick, you understand me, will be a sufficient handle for us, to spread such reports of him—an excellent thought!—Besides, a fellow that is for breaking in upon our measures, must necessarily be a friend to the Pretender.—Well well, don't let us lose time—pray, Mr. Politick, be expeditious— a Jacobite! hah! hah! hah! an excellent plot! [Exeunt. SCENE III. An appartment in the palace. BRITANNIA walking, with a roll in her hand. Enter Lord WORTHY. BRITANNIA. You see, my lord, this roll has kept us company E'er since we parted, and we take it kindly This freedom us'd with us—But, e'er we treat On other subjects, it first concerns us To clear ourselves— WORTHY. My liege, my honest breast ne'er harbour'd thought, To charge you with one grievance—grace and lustre Have still shone round you, and if those had reach'd us, Complaint had still been dumb—Our constitution, Has never boasted yet a tenderer guardian. BRITANNIA. Indeed, my lord, we would not seek to govern, The states join'd with us in our happy system, But as the sun the planets—we would attract, So as to let them feel our warmth, and fill Their orbs opaque with lustre—but aim not, By stretch of lawless power, to over-rule Their force centrifugal, which the same hand That fill'd us with our glory, lent to them; Whereby they may preserve a healthful distance, And qualify their course with temperate coolness! This league in operations, theirs and ours, Gives order mutual aspect—Let 'em both Be weigh'd, each 'gainst the other to a grain, And keep the ballance even to a hair. WORTHY. Spoke like yourself—when monarchy stands rein'd, Far better so than absolute—for power Warp'd from it's lender's purpose, is a storm, That, raging from the east, indeed proclaims It's strength, by scorching up our fields; By scattering destruction, wrecks, and death, But render'd sensible by warmth and light. Power rules in love—and, not an atom lost, Beholds each blessing given, reflected back, From every object gilded with it's ray: True mark of royal greatness, mutual ardor, Given and receiv'd—Best plan of government: Best—because plan'd by nature—where our states, Without abatement of their rights, are rul'd By a well-temper'd mixture—happy compound Of freedom and dependence—giving proof, By bending in their curves to princely love, Of being true liege subjects—but without Delivering up one inch of liberty. BRITANNIA. Take it—'tis yours!—your powers, as ours, are sacred— The order of our state then keeps due course, When they both act in concert!— But now, my lord, to prove we've not been idle, [Waving the roll. This we've perus'd—which, with becoming freedom, Glowing with loyal zeal, and patriot warmth, Kindly informs us, how our grace and favour, Have been witheld, from shedding on our people Their benign influence—With finite powers, We cannot see men's thoughts!—if, by professions, Our ear has been impos'd on, 'tis a weakness, Our uprightness of heart, may well attone for— But—now!—complaint has reach'd us—to redress, Our care has wings!—and therefore, in our choice Of Men, who, in our burthens, and our honours, Have dividend with us, lest our mistaking The fullness of abilities, should throw Suspicion on our love—only to Honour, That bears the mark, of having stood The Test, We'll yield our confidence—To This! to This, We'll give the half-way meeting—nay we'll seek it In it's retirement!—and, where'er we find it, Preventing application, we'll assign it Our offices of highest trust; that so The ray of delegated power, may shine Enlivening as our own—to preserve which, Free from all spots, we'll learn ourselves to doubt Profession unassay'd—They shall not mix Their beam with ours, with whom fair character, A feather in the scale, kicks up in air, While base self-interest (in the worth they set on't) Weighs to the ground—who with the shew of duty, (The juggling mask of civil hypocrites!) Seek but to serve themselves—our love shall be More on the watch—nor will we hug to our breast Such hollow-hearted zeal, to th'exclusion Of our more faithful subjects—but we'll seek T'erect our building on a Broader Base. [Britannia refers to the roll at the close of every paragraph. And this will be the means, my lord, to cure Party's hot-raging fever— Which in it's frantick fits attempts to unravel, The cable of the state, for separate drawings, Weak'ning the very purpose of it's make, Whose union gives strength to every thread— [Pausing, and referring again to the roll. As to the loan that's lent us, we'll consider The honest toil that gives it, and the ends For which 'tis given!—and (both these weigh'd together) The one shall teach us Thrift—the other Justice. In our Exchequer lodg'd, 'tis still the lender's! 'Tis trusted with us, as the seed that's sown, To yield 'em back their harvest—But to take Somewhat from off the burthen— As we design to practise for the future, Aiding frugality, the publick calls We'll draw to narrower compass—the defence Of British liberties, (too rich a jewel To trust with mercenaries!) we'll assign To our Militia—whose native ardor Will give an edge to valor, keener far Than sordid hire can set, with the link'd motives Of Altars! Civil and Religious Rites! Of Property and Freedom! uninspir'd!— This guard of love (trusting our cause to heaven!) Will give us leave t'unmoor our gallant navy, To guard our colonies, and send our veterans To gather laurels in our Western World!— And, not to give to murmur an occasion, To think, we pluck in waste the ripen'd fruits, Of painful industry, we purpose freely, Of our own grace to sink the gatherer's toll; Pensions, and needless Places, and the Sums We've paid for foreign aids, of which, the profits We'll take as part of the too great supplies Our present danger calls for— But when victorious peace (crown'd with her wreath Of braided bays and olive—seated between Plenty and Honour!—with fell Treachery, bound Behind her chariot wheels, crouching in fear—) Returns in her triumphal chariot home, Our Savings shall redeem our property, From sharp-fang'd mortgages—and debt's decrease, Shall make each year, still happier than the last— And, as we hope, some means will soon be thought of, That, what full-gorg'd collection else devours May reach us with less burthen—to turn each Occurrence to advantage, those in the' excise, Who've follow'd trade, we'll turn back to their work, And so prevent the cry of wanting hands, And save our bread from foreign harpeis claws. As for the rest—we'll take 'em to our navy— And now our hand is in, my lord, we'll teach Our dilatory laws to mend their pace; Nor shall the love of fees prolong the cure Of heart-sick poverty! [Referring to the roll. Those other grievances, That find not present help, thro' our love's zeal, That hastens to redress the ills fore-nam'd, Our care shall watch occasion, in their turns, To remedy. And these our resolutions, With all convenient speed, we would have publish'd: No matter if they are out-run by rumour, It will be still the better—we should like it, To have the common joy engag'd for us— And, good my lord, give it encouragement— Let it exert itself in ev'ry shape: It's good effects will keep down the disgust, (Which else may shew it's teeth) of those who fatten On our distractions, like Those cruel wretches, Who, on our coasts, enrich themselves by Wrecks; Whose thirst of cursed gold, makes nature savage, To keep back help, and dries up pity's tears!— WORTHY. Expression's lost, to tell the joy it gives me, Commands so full of Goodness to obey!— O! was our union but at home sincere, We've nothing from our foreign foes to fear!— And learn from hence, who regal sceptres sway, 'Tis love alone to glory leads the way; The surest maxim, to be TRULY GREAT, Is first to ease the burthens of THE STATE. Exeunt. SCENE IV. Enter Mr. BAYES with the Taxes. Mr. Salt-Tax, as before, beating a march upon his box. Mr. BAYES. Well, gentlemen, my business with you now, is to reward you for your long attendance, with the good news, that Lord Worthy has stood your friend, and prov'd himself to be a true lover of his country. But however, I must tell you, that some of our wise stock-jobbers, had up a sort of a plot, to get this good lord represented as a Jacobite—but—this was generally look'd upon, to be such a stale, and worn-out piece of contrivance, that it gain'd no credit—but, not to keep you any longer in suspence, I can assure you, that all our affairs are greatly mended— the method of paying our duties, is to be put upon an easier footing—and the salaries we have for so many years paid to collectors, is to be apply'd to better purposes—so that I can now, with great joy, congratulate you upon your happy deliverance from ink-bottles dangling at button-holes, and gauging walking-sticks, from this day forward—There are all your good friends— the excisemen—except the tradesmen among them (and they are to be sent back to their shops again) are all going to be metamorphos'd into honest tars—and there is such spinning going forward, for jackets and trowses—all hands are employ'd— they work double tides—a trip to sea, will soon take off the odium that now lies upon their characters; and as soon as they have learned to tie their silk handkerchiefs, and cock their narrow-brim'd hats with an air, they may hope to reconcile themselves again to their countrymen—And now, gentlemen, and ladies, you'll give me great pleasure, to tell me, you think my play ends tolerably well—all I can say, in the behalf of it, is—that my design was honest—and, unless you have some excisemen, some jews, or stock-jobbers, amongst you, I don't doubt but you will give us your approbation—[Sir Jonathan Jolly, crossing the stage] —This is quite lucky, Sir Jonathan, shall I presume, to beg the favour of you, upon this happy occasion, to give us the song, you was so obliging to entertain us with, the other night—I know you are too good-humour'd, to put us off with an excuse, as your voice is too good to want one—[Turning to the audience] The song is rather—too grave—but consider, gentlemen!— we can't be too serious in the cause of Liberty! THE SONG, Sir Jonathan sings. Let the French hop and sing, and a cage relish best, Like birds, who their freedom have lost from the nest, But Britons, deserving a much better fate, Should they chance to be catch'd by the lime-twigs of state, Are birds that have fled, and sweet liberty known, Whose songs are no more, when their freedom is gone! So Judah's sweet harps on the willows were hung, In a land of oppression, untun'd, and unstrung, To ask of the captives a song was in vain, Till liberty strung them, and tun'd them again. Mr. BAYES. By this song I intended to please the graver part of my audience, who enter deeply into things, and make sober reflections—but, as I would willingly please all this good company—I shall conclude with a dance—Here! Mr. Salt-Tax, I find your Box is in pretty good tune—Mr. Window-Tax, Mr. Window-Tax,—Oh!—I see you are here —well—now, Jack, I believe you may take off your patch, and release your eye from darkness—and, sweet Mrs. Mead, shall I beg the favour of you, to honour my good friend here, with being his partner —you two shall lead up—and, Mr. Malt-Tax, where are you?—Ho! very well—here Mrs. Hop, come, you two are old acquaintance! I believe you may now venture to throw away your crutch—you two shall be the next couple— and here, Mr. Candle-Tax, and Mrs. Gin— Madam! I am extremely obliged to you, that you did not replenish your cask, for, in winding up the bottom, if any of my actors had kill'd themselves, with your pernicious liquor, as my play is not a tragedy, it would have been quite out of character—you two shall stand third—well, Mr. Salt-Tax, I believe we are now ready—if you please to strike up, and jig it away. THE DANCE. [Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
