      <field name="fulltext">ACT. 1. SCEN. 1. Enter King Etheldred, Alured his Brother, Edmond Duke of Thetford, Edulf, Edell Earl of Hampshire, with their Swords drawn, and some Souldiers wounded before them. Alarms continuing afar off. King, O stay and hear me speak my noble Friends, my Subjects and my Souldiers hear your King; in nine set Battels gainst the conquering Danes hath Ethelred with various fortunes fought, to rescue you and England from the spoyls of War and Tyranny: Recall your spirits, this City Winchester is all our strength, And if you cease to fight, the Foe comes on, With bloody rage, and sad confusion. Cap. 1. The breach is made, the Danes rush ore the Walls, and like the pent up Ocean 'bove his banks, falls from his height with roaring violence, and drowns us all in blood. Alu. despair not quite, We yet may beat'em back, arm, arm to fight. Edm. The Danes are in the streets, slaughter begins, and execution is their Souldiers words. O will you lay your throats beneath their swords, or doth your danger make you desperate? your houses will be preys to fire and theft. King. Your Wives and Daughters slaves to Danish lust. Alur. Your Children in their Mothers arms struck dead. Edm. The names of English torn from memory, Oh let your valors in one chance be hurl'd, Or quite extirpe a Nation from the World. King. See, on my knees, I pray you, for your selves; O 'tis for Englands safety not my own, makes me a Subject to my Subjects thus, pitty your King, your Country, and your selves that now are falling, let your valors rise, and in this last resist your enemies. Alu. Now by my Princely birth (my royal Brother) His sight amazes more than all the Danes; rise, rise, and speak no more; put them away, the stones will sooner yeeld you aid than they. 2. Capt. Rip up our Brests, and see our loyal hearts to fight and die for you in this just cause, But death hath seized us, all our bloods are wasted, and through our many wounds our souls exhausted. 1. Capt. And since we can no more, O let your swords take swift revenge, and save the Danes a labor, In killing us you ease our present woes. Alarm and cryes within. Ent. Edel. Fly royal Princes, save your lives by flight, the day looks clouded, there's no hope of safety; The traiterous Osbert Duke of Mertia makes Head against you, and with all his Troops, enters the City gates, guards in the Danes, tryumphs in slaughter thorough every street. The aged Father of St. Swithins Abby, that with his holy Cross between his hands, mounted the Walls to cause the Souldiers on to fight for Freedom and Religion, Seeing this Treason, hath retir'd himself, and on the holy Altar heaves his hands, awaiting death; the chast religious Mayds, with Cartesmunda their fair Governess, Flock to the Temple as their last defence, Hoping that place may shield their innocence. King. Come, Princely Alured, my noble Brother, lets seek to stop their pressing through the City, if we must dieâ. Alur. 'Tis but our Fate Which even till death close by thy side Ile wait. Exeunt. Alarm. Enter Osbert, Erkinwald, Harold, and the Danes crying Kill, kill, the wounded Souldiers rise and fight, to them, the King, Alured, and the English, who are driven out and the King slain. Edm. Seek for your safety, Sir, the King is dead. Alur. See noble Edmond what the Danes have done, a King, by Heaven created for a Crown, now onely made fit for a golden Urne, betrayd to death and slaughter pittiless. Edm. Curse on the Traitors heart that wrought this Treason, rebellious Osbert that betrayest thy Country. Alur. Leave his reward to Heaven that will avenge it, and brave Duke Edmond, sith the times are such, lets take disguise with speed and seek for safety; If Heaven be pleas'd, brave Lord, we yet may live, if not, what Heaven has given, ile freely give. His thee to Thetford, raise thy friends in Norfolk, If I escape with life, Ile post to Scotland, Donald the King is of a noble spirit, and will not slack I know to send his aide against this common Foe to both our Kingdoms. There shalt thou meet me, tho our journeys far, Wee'l once again renue this dreadful war. Edm. Spoke like the hope of England! Royal Prince! shake hands in this red City, and then part, for in thy quarrell I will live and dye. Alu. First bear hence this cold clay of Majesty, our hapless Brother, and revenge his death. Edm. That, and what else may but express thy Worth and Title to the Crown, ile still pursue, or may black infamy my baseness tell. Alu. My soul shall quit thy love. Brave Prince farewell. Exeunt severally. Alarm. Enter Canutus, K. of Denmark, Elgina his Sister, Erkinwald, Osbert, Harold, Osrick, Souldiers. Osb. The Cities wone, my Lord, the King is slain, and great Canutus with his Royal Troops may take possession of this conquer'd Town. Canu. Thy love brave Osbert duke of Mertia, revolting from the English to our part, has overturn'd the City Winchester, drown'd in the blood of Kingly Etheldred and all his Hoast. Hie thee Duke Erkinwald, conduct our beauteous Sister to our Tent: You shall go back Elgina strongly guarded, till with our swords we clear all passages that may oppose our peaceful enterance. Stand on yon Hill, and hear the English crys; While Trumpets sound the Danish Victories. Conduct her Elkinwald. Erk. I shall, great Prince. Elgi. The Gods protect my noble Brothers safety, and crown thy brows with wreathes of victory. Canu. Duke Harold take our Guards, and march before, ransack the Temple, and each private house, Who bears the name of English strike him dead; This day the Kingdom's wholly conquered. Osb. Long may it so remain to great Canutus; an hundred thirty years the English Kings have paid just Tribute to the conquering Danes, which now re-conquered, with assured hopes to hold possession of the State and Crown, see here the slaughtered Body of a King Usurping and disloyal Etheldred, Thus Osbert sets his foot upon thy head, That was annointed late with precious Balm, Rejoycing that by me thy pride is faln. Canu. Forbear brave English Lord, remember this, he was a King, let not thy Subject foot tread on thy Sovereigns head; Take off his Crown, and when the slaughter's past present it to us, and we will then reward thy faithful service; enter the Town, spare neither Sex nor Age, Whip out this English Race, with iron rods; The vanquish'd are but men, the Victors, gods. Exeunt. Alarm. A great Cry within. Enter Abbot bearing a Cross, Cartesmunda with two Tapers burning, which she placeth on the Altar, two or three Nuns following. Abbot. Come holy Virgins, hie you to the Altar. Car. The raging Foe pursues, defend us Heaven, Take Virgin tears, the balm of martyr'd Saints, as tribute due to thy Tribunal Throne; with thy right hand keep us from rage and murder; let not our danger fright us, but our sins: Misfortunes touch our Bodies, not our Souls; Keep Faith before us, from Hell none escapes, Our deaths may be thy will, but not our Rapes. Abb. Fair Cartesmunda, bright illustrious Maid, O be thou constant in this day of tryal. Vertue is Vice unless it do persever, That is true Holiness that lasts for ever. Car. Upon my knees to you and Heaven I swear, when I do yeeld my Virgin vow to lust in the soft Twines of an insatiate bed, may I give up the treasure of my youth To such a man, whose lust and poisoned breath May soon reward my sin, and be my death. Follow, follow, Alarm, Abb. Such Vows being kept are true religious. Hark, hark, the bloody Foe has forc'd the Temple. Turn boldly and be constant, here's the tryal. All Virgins, To Nature wee'l be false, to Heaven be loyal. Alarm. Enter Canutus, Erkinwald, Harrold, Hofman, Osrick, Souldiers. Canu. On, on, kill all, spare none; this by Canutus dyes; ha! Who holds my conquering hand? what power unknown, By Magick thus transforms me to a stone, Senseless of all the faculties of life? My blood runs back, I have no power to strike. Call in our Guards, and bid them all give ore, Sheath up your swords with me, and kill no more; Her Angel-beauty cryes, she must not dye, Nor live but mine: O I am taken strangely: Methinks I lift my sword against my self, When I oppose her: All perfection O see, the pearled dew drops from her eyn; Arise in peace; fair soul, will you be mine? Car. If you be death not else. Canut. Here is his power, for if my wrath thou move, This blow shall rid my heart of torturing love; Pale deaths effect shall take away the cause, and I be free as Ayr: Thou Sorceress, that stay'st my hand with Witchcraft, and with Charms: I will unwind thy cunning Exorcismes. Rare beautious Virgin, Will you love Canutus? Cartes. When to these bodies dead, thou givest new life, I then will love thee. Canut. Ile give thee death, As those in blood have faln; and thou shall dye. I cud,âWe will withdraw; Then kill her. Cartes. And I am ready, Tyrant, do thy worst. O heaven! Canut. Hold Traytor, hold, th'ast kill'd thy Sovereign: Does she not bleed? O Love how strong's thy fear? All England shall not buy this Jewel from me: Didst thou strike her? Har. I had not drawn my sword, you came so sudden. Canut. Nor never may'st thou draw it 'gainst her life, so she bee pleas'd to love. Cartes. To hate thee I will love, but never love thee. Canut. Grant me thy Love, my Royalties are thine, and thou shalt strike the Sun blind with thy lustre, in Ornaments more rich then is the Treasure hid in the unknown bottome of the Sea; And for thy pleasuresâ Cartes. Peace, sleek Flattery. Thou seekest to violate my Virgin Vow with thy inchanting tongue, which ere I break, The heavens shall fright the earth; Saints prove unjust, Death lose this power, ere I imbrace mans lust. Canut. She turns me wild with rage and passion; Ile rip thy bosome up to see that wonder, a constant womans heart: Sure thine is flint, yet thus Ile peirce it were it Adamant: Oh! He offers to strike, and his sword falls. Erkin. My Royal Lord. Har. Great Prince recall your spirits. Canut. I'm struck with lightning from the torrid Zone, Stand all betwixt me and that flaming Sun; Yet do not: Let her heat in death be spent. Go Erkinwald, convey her to my Tent. Let her be guarded with more watchful eyes, Then heaven has stars, for fear she be surpriz'd; If here she stay, I shall consume and dye, 'Tis time must give my passions remedy. Art thou not gone? Kill him that gazeth on her, For all that see her, sure must do at like me, And Treason will be wrought against us for her. Be sudden. To our Tents, Prethee away, The hell on earth is love that brings delay. Exit Erkin. with Cartes. Har. The Duke of Mertia with the English Crown attends the pleasure of my Lord the King. Canut. Present him to us; O obdurate Maid, The English Crown is valueless to thee, This thy Idea crowns my victory. Ent. Osbert. Osb. Low, as obedience, thus the vanquish'd English yeelds subject duty to the King of Danes, and with this conquer'd Crown our lives and honors. Canut. You please us well Duke Osbert; come invest us, thy warlike hand shall crown Canutus head, For by thy aid, this Realm is conquered. Osb. Long live Canutus mighty King of Danes, of Denmark, Norway, and of England King. Florish. Canut. Thanks Duke of Mertia, We must now remember that by thy late revolt we wan this City, slew Etheldred the Lord of many thousands. Now for reward which should ha' come before, Thou never shalt crown King or subject more. Off with his head. Osb. My Lord. Canut. A guard I say, stop up the Traytors mouth: Let us have fear, not love; Mans nature will be bold where it is lik'd; A Kingdome got by blood must so be kept: I will not hear him speak, Away with him; Bring me his wisdoms head into my Tent, there weel converse. Osb. Heavens wrath is justly sent. Exit with Guard. Canut. Here was it that I saw that blazing Star whose bright aspect promis'd a general peace to this affrighted Kingdome: Torches Slaves, the night comes on us, we are all in darkness, prepare my bed, weel rest us after toyl, and sleep, thou mother of forgetfulness, drown all my thoughts that ere I saw this Virgin, make her a stranger to my memory, that I may joy in this, not dye for love. Hofman, her looks are heaven; her eyes are Cupids darts; Go bring her to me: Art not gone yet slave? It is an Embassie too good for Hermes, the Herauld of the gods: Thou shalt meet Lightning, yet on thou must, go ask that weeping Nun, dost hear me? Art not gone? Were Hellen now alive, this Maid alone would stain her beauty and new Troy should burn, Paris would dye again to live to see her: O bring me her, Dull slave with reverence; Let not the Sun be more out-worshipp'd by the tann'd Barbarian: Tell her, A bleeding Lover sent thee to her, and name me if thou chance to see her smile: Tha'st not forgot my name. A cup of Wine ready. Hof. No my good Lord. Canut. Let me not spurn thee, Go, Fetch me some Wine, weel war a while with Love. Fair PhÃ¦dra, who in Corinth once was found, compar'd to her, as different they wo'd show, as sable Ebony to Alpine Snow; when first I saw her at the holy Altar, Surely the gods more careful of her life, then of a mass of souls brought me upon her, and fix'd my soul to hers: Let's have some Musick. Ent. Hofman. But thou prevent'st us with a better sound. The Accent of her Name strikes Musick dumb, for she is Ayr of all perfection.âHer Name? Hof. Her three times sacred Name, most Royal King, is Cartesmunda, a Religious Nun. Canut. It needs no Epithite t'express the Name, For Cartesmunda is the worlds bright frame. I charge thee Villain, strait conduct her to me. Her sacred Name is Cartesmunda call'd; O fairest soul! I fear't a harder Task to conquer thee, than all the spacious Bounds of Barbary; Had the gods none to take my glory from me, but a weak woman? O strange destin'd Fate! Ten Worlds in Arms against Canutus State. Enter Osrick and Cartesmunda. See the day breaks; Look where Aurora comes, and see the Mornings dew falls from her eyes, begetting better Flowers than those of May from the glad ravish'd Earth: O tell me Fayr, Speak English Maid; How camest thou to my sight? What makest thou here? Camest thou to murder me? Cartis. What all my friends have found but wretched I, I seek for, death to end my misery. Canut. But canst not find him, for thou art immortal; Death wud dye for thee, if he ever saw thee, and for thy sake make blunt his Ebon dart; Pray weep no more, He prayes that might command; We will not force the Jewel thou so prizest, till thou bequeath it freely to my youth. We are oth'Eagles kind, and scorn to stoop to an ignoble Thought: Sweet will you hear me; 'Twas King Canutus fetch'd that sigh you heard: Still turn aside! Well, if you loathe me, leave me; there lyes your way: Yet be advis'd, Fond Maid; No sooner shalt thou pass from forth my sight, but the base Souldiers will lay hold on thee, and what I value 'bove Religion, will not be thus much there, They'l ravish thee, and therefore prethee stay, with tears I pray thee. Thou frosty April, woo't not love for love? Doo't then for Honor, Pleasure, Majesty: Ungentle still? Then get thee from my sight: Go to the Woods, and learn of wilder Beasts a little pitty: You preserve chastity with a foul sin, Ingratitude: Goodnight; Yet stay, We are strangers, We may kiss at parting; Thou hast infus'd Promethean Fires into me: I have two lives, Yet none of them mine own. Fair Cartesmunda, If thou wilt be gone, bid me Goodnight, though in some Language that I understand not: Cartes. Goodnight, My Lord. Canut. When shall I have thy Love? Cartes. When men shall cease to think there is a God, or any thing more strange: Alas, great Prince! My chastity stands at the Bar above, My Life I owe to you, but not my Love. Canut. So young, and full of grey hair'd Purity: In vain I shoot against a wall of brass, that sends mine own shafts back upon my self. I must choose fitter time to conquer thee. Lights, and a double guard t'attend my Love. (Fairest) Good rest; be dutious in her keeping, Ile wake with thought of thee, and then with weeping. Exeunt. Manet Erkinwald, Harold, Captain. Erk. The King is Love-sick Harold; Joyn thy powers, and round begirt this City Winchester; Beset the wayes, let not the English scape, That stood the siege and sack of Winchester. Har. I think there's few escap'd, the King is slain And England now submits toth'conquering Dane. Erk. Prince Alured, the Brother to the King, and Edmond Duke of Thetford both are scap'd and may raise powers afresh: Therefore be careful. Enter Elgina. Har. Doubt not my Lord. See here comes the Princess. Ex. Erk. Madam, I bring you dear commends from your great Brother, England is won, and the white flag of peace is rear'd upon the ruins of this City, King Etheldred is slain, and great Canutus invested with his Crown and Dignity. What conquest can be more? Elg. That you subdue your thoughts; good sir, give ore, till I have conference with the King. Erk. And then youle love? Elg. Till then ile love no other. Enter two Souldiers dragging in Alured in disguise. 1 Soul. Drag him along, he's English and must dye. Come forward sir. Alu. Yee cannot fright me, 'tis my wish to die, And I that seek it scoff your Tyranny, O for fair Englands good and my lost powers, Mine be the suffering, and the glory yours. Erk. What prisoner have our Danish Souldiers got? 2 Sould. One of the straggling English, my good Lord, And now are leading him to have him tortur'd. Erk. Let him come near us, Say, what art thou? (Whispers with Alured. Elg. Some God, I think, disguis'd in humane shape, come down to court us with bewitching looks, There's something tels me, if my thoughts speak truth, To thee I owe the pleasure of my youth. Erk. Was that thy fortune, 'thad been better far Th'adst fallen amongst thy friends in this dread war Then live to further shame. Away and hang him. Elg. Stay good my Lord. Erk. Madam forbear, the King hath sworn the deaths of all that bar'd his enterance to this City; they scorn'd his profer'd peace, and now must perish. This may suffice, Hee's English, and must dye. Elg. If all the English perish, then must I, for I (now know) in England here was bred, although descended of the Danish blood, King Hardiknut my Father, thirty years governed the one half of this famous Kingdom, where I, that time was born an English Princess; Therefore I pray, my Lord, set this man free Let me bestow his life and liberty; Ile beg it of the King. Erk. Madam, tis yours, go Souldiers drink this gold, and let our word to you discharge your Prisoner. 1. Soul. It shall my Lord, wo'd we were rid of all the English thus. Ex. Sould. Elg. Pray Sir, resolve me, what has your fortunes been? Alu. The most of woes dear Princess, I have liv'd to see my Country ruin'd, my friends murdred, My self condemn'd to die, and but for you I had been dead, that life I have's your due. Elg. Comfort your self, henceforth you shall be mine, Attend this, noble Lord, 'tis for your good; Where mildness conquers, we must shed no blood. Erk. You are all compact of Love and Mercy (Lady) attend me sir, and for this Princess sake, we will prefer thee; come beauteous Madam you now must leave the Tents to entertain the glorious tryumphs of the great Canutus, whom you must comfort, for the Love-sick King sits sadly doating on a beauteous Nun. Elg. Is't possible (my Lord) the King our brother, In midst of Conquest sho'd be Cupids prisoner? Erk. Such is loves power, it flies with swiftest wings, And midst his armed Guards he woundeth Kings. Elg. Venus defend me, if he be thus powerful we shall be all Souldiers, and these stern Wars must be transformed into Loves encounters. Well, my good Lord, wee'l see this English wonder my Brother so admires, call for our Guard and Train. Erk. They are ready (madam) Elg. Go you before then (sir) and Ile not stay, Look to your Prisoner, lest he run away. Erk. O fear not LadyâCome sir. Ex. Erk. Alur. Elg. Wo'd he wo'd run, so he wo'd take me with him, by Jove I love him, but 'tis bashfulness, that thus makes women hide their passions, even till we burst and die; we must not plead love, Yea, tho't be offered we must still refuse it. With fond denial when we wish to chuse it. I see no sence for this; well amorous youth, For thy sake Ile teach women what to do, And spight of custom to begin to wooe. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. 2. Enter Thorneton with Needles, and a A Lambs-skin, Singing. Thor. Be gone, be gone, my Juggy, my Puggy, be gone my Love, my Dear, my Money is gone, and ware I have none, but one poor Lamb-skin here: Why so, and who buies this Lamb-skin now, A most fine, dainty, nappy Lamb-skin, if a Lady would line her Petticoat, A sweeter Lamb-skin cannot kiss her Catastrophe: Let me see, how often do I transform my self in four and twenty hours? First, Here in Northumberland, mine own native Country, amongst poor people I change these myllan fustian Needles into eggs, then my eggs into money, and then am I a Merchant, not of Eels-skins, but Lamb-skins; and thus poor Thornton of Northumberland, picks out a living in spight of Beggery: Yet this is not the living that I aim at neither; for I may tell to all men that I have a terrible mind to be a horrible rich man; nay, I am half assured on't too, for where ere I go, there's something still whispers in mine ears, I shall be greater, and here at Newcastle too, into which I am now entring. All which to confirm, a Witch or a Jugler, has guided my fate in writing, and now Ile read it once again, that all the World may know my fortunes, and wonder at them. Mark then, for thus it goes. Reads. Go to Newcastle, take thy fate, Yet ere thou enter, count thy State, If service in that place thou get Thy wealth will rise to infinite, And Thorntons name in England stand, The richest Subject in the Land. O fortune, how hast thou favoured a poor Merchant stranger? I have all this wealth in conceit already, and all this have I got of a cunning man, for two poor Millan Needles, and one of 'em lacks an eye too. No matter. Hope keeps the heart whole, and I shall be rich, that's certain, but how I know not, nor care not, so I come in any likeness; my Fortune says, I must get a service here in Newcastle, but ere I enter I must count the wealth I have now, and that's soon reckoned, one poor half penny and a Lambs-skin, is all the wealth I have yfaith, and yet for all this my state must stand the richest Subject in the Land; 'tis certain, my mind gives me it, and I am assur'd on't, yet I must put my self in remembrance of my poverty, lest I should forget my self when I am grown so rich, I will write a note on't ere I enter the Town, and hang it here upon some tree, to keep it in mind, as long as the River of Tine runs under it. Let me see, instead of paper this Tile-stone shall serve, and here's an Ink-horn I stole from my Hostis, a scurvy Quean, if I had not given her money for my Ale, she would have chaulked me presently, this shall serve the turn. Ile sit down and write, sweet Hellicon inspire me with thy Castalian lucke. Enter Goodgift, and Randolfe, and George, his Wife. Good. Come, come dispatch, the wind is North North West, and blows fair on us; Where is George my Factor? Fact. Here Sir, Good. At the next ebb, good George, I and the ship fall down to Tinmouth; are your books made even, the goods made fit, and all things fitting for the voyage. Fact. All's done sir, the Commodities priz'd and summ'd; their value at my back return from Sea, I hope to treble to you. Good. Heaven deal in that, or gain, or loss we must be still contented, and therefore are we call'd Adventurers, because we know 'tis hazzard. Rand. 'Tis indeed sir, and I do wonder at this gain of hazard youle set so great a state, seeing the time joyns with the Sea in danger; the Danish Fleet watcheth to pill the English Venturers. Then be advis'd. Wife. Yet to avoid all dangers Husband, I'de have you do as here my Brother doth, venture your state in your own Country, tho the gains be smaller, the safety's not so doubtful. Good. I, I, Wife, thy Brother Randolfe here is known a famous Merchant for Newcastle Coals, and England holds the circuit of his traffick, but we that are Adventurers abroad, must fame our Country through all Christendom, nay far beyond our Christian Territories, to Egypt, Barbary, and the Tauny Moors, Where not indeed? if Sea and wind gives way unto our dancing Vessels; nay, nay, Brother, your merchandize compar'd with us, I tell you, is but a poor fresh-water venture. Rand. Well brother, well, pursue your Foraign gain, I rest content at home, at the years end wee'l cast the difference 'twixt your far-fetch'd treasure, and our Newcastle home-bred Minerals, you shall perceive strange transformation, black coals turn'd to white silver, that's my comfort sir. Good. And take it to you sir, with much good I wish it. But stay, stay, who is that? Rand. One that is very brain busie it seems. Good. Peace, peace, observe him prethee, Thorn. Here did Thornton enter in With hope, a half penny, and a Lambs-skin, It shall go yfaith. Ile never strive to mend it; foot this Poetry, and a mans brains were not well laid in his head, woo'd make him mad, I think if there be any Hellicon in England 'tis here at Newcastle, I am inspired with it, every Coal-pit has a rellish on't, for who goes down but he comes out as black as Ink. Good. Is not this fellow mad? Rand. Good faith I doubt it. Thorn. Well this writing will I set up here at the Towns end, that when I have got all these riches together, and sit amongst my comely Brethren, I then may staulk the pace of wit, and worship, here to read this Manuscript, then will I view my Ware-houses, disperse my coyn, comfort the poor, I and perhaps build Churches. Rand. Either he speaks to himself, or hee's possest with some strange talking spirit, that Dialogues within him. Thorn. Then will I have some Fifty Beades-men in my life time, for that's the first way to be prayed for here, and mourned for when I am gone, and on their Gowns their Cullisance shall be six millan. Needles, and a silver Lambs-skin. Good. Ha, ha, the more he speaks, methinks 'tis more distracted. Lets question him. Wife, Is hee not, think you Husband, one of those Players of Interludes that dwels at Newcastle, and conning of his Part, for surely these are other mens matters hee talks of? Doe you hear honest man, and Friend, let mee instruct you to bee wise and sober. Sings. Thorn. I come not hither for thee to teach, I have no pulpit for to Preach, I woo'd th'adst kist me under the Breech, As thou art a Lady gay. Wife, Marry come up with a vengeance. Good. La you wife, you see what 'tis to trouble a man in his Meditations, prethee let him alone, hee's not mad I warrant thee. Thorn. With hope, a half-penny, and a Lambs-skin, I protest I never pleas'd my self better. Let mee see, what day's this; O Monday! I shall love Mondays vein to poetize as long as I live, for this trick. Good. Good speed, Good fellow. Thor. Ha, Whose that? O I thank you Gentlemen; If I have good speed, Ile do good deeds the sooner: Your sufferance a little I beseech you; Then will I build some famous Monument. Rand. Thou build'st i'th'Ayr I think: Prethee, what Countryman art? Thor. Faith Sir, a poor Northumberland man and yet I tell yee Gentlemen, not altogether the poor Fellow, which you behold me; Fortune may change, If you seek what I shall be, 'Tis infinite, and cannot be summ'd together: But if you wo'd know my present store; It is all summ'd on this Tyle-stone: I shall be very rich, that's certain; and this Town of Newcastle must be the raising of my fortune, if there I get service, then are Wealth and Treasure my servants. Good. And such a servant cannot want a Master. But Prethee tell me, Whence hast thou these hopes? Thorn. Pray Sir, read that, then tell me your opinion. Good. Prethee let's see't. Go to Newcastle take thy Fate, Yet ere thou enter, count thy State: If service in that place thou get, Thy wealth will rise to infinit; And Thorntons name in England stand The richest subject in the Land.âExcellent yfaith. And dost thou beleeve all this? Thorn. As sure as you live Sir, and all the world cannot drive me from this opinion, but that I shall be a very rich man. Good. I like thy confidence: How dost desire to have Imployment? Wilt thou go to Sea. Thorn. Sea or Land, Fire or Ayr; Let Newcastle be my home, and some honest man my Master. This Halfpenny, and this Millan Needle, shall I multiply to a Million of Halfpence, and this innocent Lambs-skin to a Magnificent Lordship. Good. Stay there, I prethee, 'tis wealth enough for a subject, come, Ile give thee handsel, that's Entertainment, my name is Goodgift a Merchant of Newcastle, where thou desirest to serve, give me thy hand, If I do live to see thee this rich man, I shall be proud to say, I was thy Master. Thorn. I am your servant Sir, and will be faithful. Good. Obey me then at first, as Ile imploy thee: Thou shalt to Sea, I see thou wilt be thrifty: Come hither George, take him a Shipboard with thee, change his Apparrel strait, and make him handsome; I begin so well to rellish his Plainness that I am half perswaded of his hopes. How say'st thou wife? Wife. Nay, Nay, He bad me kiss his Breech, Birlady, but that's no matter Husband, seeing I see his Fortunes are so hopeful, he shall have my likeing : Come hither Thornton, since thy Master sends thee out to Sea, there's something for thee to begin thy stock with, and if thou double it, Ile ne're grudge yfaith, So thou't remember me, when th'art a rich man. Good. Ha, Ha,âshe's confident already. Rand. So shall I ne're be, till I see it Sir. Good. Well, Well, Do as I bid thee George, under thy self, let him have charge of all. George. How will he put off these Commodities he has Sir? Thorn. Tush, Tush, Ile have an out-cry Fellow George, for so I take it Sir, your name is now. George. Why what's thy Lambs-skin good for? Thorn. Marry Muff Sir. Wife. Thou say'st true indeed Thornton, and Ile purchase it of thee, for that purpose, Ile give thee a Groat for it to line my Muff withal. Thorn. And you shall ha't Mistriss, It has been lain dead on my hands a great while, and now it shall be dead on yours, only this, Sweet Master, I must inteat you, that ere I enter the Town, I may hang up this writing here; I doubt not Sir, but at my coming home, I shall be able to ha't cut in stone. Good. Agreed, Agreed, an honest Motion. How now, Who's this comes here? Enter Grim. Wife. 'Tis Grim the Collyer, Ist't not brother? Rand. O yes sister, the main Over-seer of all my Coles, I warrant you, his heads more troubled too, then Thorntons was to count his hop'd-for wealth, and mark how wisely he proceeds about it. Grim. Let me see now, first five hundred Chaldron of Coals at ten Groats a Chaldron, that is, in Coals, and mony; ten Groats, and ten Groats, is twice ten Groats; Then take twice ten out of two times ten, and there remains four times ten: fivescore Chaldron at ten Groats a Coal comes to five shillings, then take me thirty Coals out of thirty Chaldron, and put them together, and there's the whole Voyage, so thirty Chaldron of Coals, comes to five Chaldron of Angels. Good. O rare! He multiplies bravely. Rand. I told you what a reck'ning he wo'd make on't. Grim. Then to cast how many Fourpence halfpennies there are in a Chaldron of Angels: Let me see, take half a Chaldron out of a whole Chaldron, and there remainsâNo, No, this is not the way; I must begin lower: A Chaldron of Angels, if you take nothing out, there remains something: This is the honest way for a servant when he casts up his Masters Reckonings, to take nothing out, and then the whole Stock remains untouched still. Rand. I marry Sir, I like that well; Why, How now Grim, What art thou doing? Grim. I cry you mercy Master, I am even doing my good will to make your Accounts right Sir: There's five hundred Chaldron of Coals leaving the River, and ship'd away: They'l be Sea-sick to morrow. Rand. How many for London (Grim?) Grim. Three hundred Chaldron, Sir. Rand. And whither go the rest? Grim. 'Twas purposed they sho'd ha gone to Winchester, but its thought since the Danes came thither, they have little need of Sea-coal, every place is so hot; they say a Taylor burnt his Goose, and yet no fire came neer him. Rand. That's strange. Well Grim, bid them alter their course for Winchester, bid them put in at Lyn, and Yarmouth, and let London be the farthest of their journey until these Wars afford us better safety. Grim. Alas Master, if you stow up your ships, you may ee'n hang up your Collyers, for they'l starve and dye if they come above ground once; you have sevenscore pits, and seven hundred lusty Collyers daily digging in them, and if they come above ground onceâWhat Thornton my old Acquaintance! How ist't, How ist't man? Thorn. Never better yfaith. Good. Dost thou know him? Grim. Better then the Taylor that made his Doublet: Know Thornton, the famous Needle-maker of Northumberland? There's not a Beggar that carries a Patch about her, but knows him; All our Collyers buy Needles of him for the same purpose: Many a night has he lain in the Sellerage amongst: Thornton, How many Eggs have you roasted at our fire in the Coal-pits? Thorn. Thou posest me now yfaith Grim, I have been infinitly beholding to thee, and when I am a rich man, here's my hand, Ile requite it. Grim. I had rather thou would'st set a certain day to do't. Dost thou think to be rich by Pedlers Eggs, and Lambs-skins? Thorn. But I have other Imployments now Grim. Good. He is my servant Sir, and is already by my best liking voyaging to Sea. Grim. Does he go a foot Sir? Good. Sirra, Sirra, He's a Venturer too, and when you see his safe return again with wealth from Sea, you'l make legs to him. Grim. How legs to him? I scorn him and his Lambs-skins. No Sir, Thornton must remember I am Controler of the Cole-pits, and that many a night I have committed him to the Hole, and there he lay forty Fathom deep beneath me, where I co'd have buried him alive, if I had thought on't: Make legs to him? Good. Come, Come Sir, Wee'l have you friends at parting; Go George, follow my directions, and let Thornton have that Imployment I prescribed to you; Come Sir, you shall first erect your Character according to your mind at the Towns end, to keep a Record of your Entrance in. Thorn. With hope, a Halfpenny, and a Lambs-skin, that's all Sir. Grim. Ha, Ha, a brave rich man I promise you. Exeunt. Enter Erkinwald and Alured. Erkin. Is thy name Eldred? Alur. Yes, My good Lord. Erkin. Thou art my prisoner still, and we have power o're all, thy Life and Fortunes. Alur. I still confess it, Sir. Erkin. 'Tis well, Canst thou guess then, why my love extends it self so lineally towards thee? Thou know'st that even from death I have advanced thee close to my self, and trust thee with my secrets, and one above the rest, requires thy aid, thy subtle and quick brain can better forge matter of fair discourse than mine can be, The bright Elgina thou must court for me. In Peace and War she has been still my aym, for her the tedious night I do beguile, with serious thoughts of her divinity, and watching till the midnight Chimes be past, have wak'd again before the Village Cock had call'd the Plowman to his early labor. Go plead my love, yet ere thou go, here swear (Yet I with love will win thee, not with fear) Never to injure me in this disguise, Nor with Icarian wing to soar too high. Alur. I were a villain to betray your trust, being so meritless of your great favours, and therefore vow by all that man may swear by, Ile be as true to you in this imployment, as truth is to the just. Erk. Thou hast said enough, I leave it to thy trustâGo, return and make me happy, there's gold, spend freely. Exit. Alu. Fortune I see thou now art blind, and foolish, and without aim direct'st thy giddy shafts, these gifts thou givest to me, which I despise, what physick helps a man just as he dies? Tis Englands peace that I would live to Court, but she is fled, and I a captive Prince, slave to my mortal foes, till time release me, that once I may regreet my English friends, which long ere this, I know have wish'd my presence, to joyn our forces for our Countryes freedom. Enter Elgina. But here she comes whom I must plead for love; my faith is past, and were she beauties Queen, and half the world her dowre, I wo'd not wrong The trust I have receiv'd, Ile court her for him, And plead my Masters love, though she abhor him. Elg. Who's there, Eldred? Alu. Your pardon beauteous Princess, I must wooe you. Elg. But ile prevent you sir, for ile wooe you. Alu. For noble Erkinwald my warlike Master. All love from him. Elg. Is nothing like to thee, That conquer'st love, and Cupids Deity. Alu. You do amaze me Lady. Elg. Be not afraid, But tell me boldly, could you love a Maid That for thy sake wo'd be a president, and teach all women a new way to win the often wish'd desires of stubborn men? In me you shall observe patience and duty, tender care, and fear; by thy bright eyes, Ile teach the constant Turtle truer love, and make the Nuns at Vesta's Altar swear, The Virgin state is not so strict to move As the obsequious life you lead in love. And cannot you yet say, you mean to love me. Alu. Beshrew me Madam but you tempt me shrewdly, pray give me leave to think upon'tâ.Ha! my vow's not broke yet; for I wooe not her, that was my oath sure, and I think there's no man that can withstand the wooing of a woman. Fond fool, how quickly youth and blood transform? Elg. Come, What's your answer? Alu. Dearest Lady, There is but one thing in the world that hates me, and you have brought it with you. Elg. O me! what sho'd it be? Alu. Forgive my rashness, 'tis a thing within you, not you, that charms me from you. Elg. Be it my heart, ile pull it out, so thou wilt love me. Alu. O gracious Princess, 'tis your Royal blood, so near allied unto the great Canutus Keeps me at distance, were our states made even My love sho'd be as strong as zeal to Heaven. Therefore Imperial Maidâ Elg. No more, if that be all, we will dispence with greatness, use me like one that loves you, Ile Invent a plot that shall in short secure us both; I crave but this, that thou be true of faith: For by my life I love thee. Alu. And (gracious Princess) since now I see your passions are unfeign'd, I vow not onely to requite your love, but with affected and sincere intents to crown your wishes, though it work my ruin. Elg. Our faiths and hearts are one then, Cupids wings, Can crown mean births, with joy, make slaves of Kings Knew Erkinwald my heart, hee'd change with thee, And be thy slave to have command ore me. Lend me thine ear in private. Enter Erkinwald. Erk. At it so close? Ile hear their conference, win her, and gain thy Freedom, Love and Honor. Ha! That kiss (bold slave) past thy Commission; Death and the Devil, she kisseth him too. O fond Erkinwald be blind and do not see them; thy office was to speak, but not for thy self. Alu. Natures Divinity is in thy looks, and he an Atheist sees thee, and not loves. Should Erkinwald now see it, I wo'd love thee, tho for each kiss I had a several torture, ten deaths for thy injoying were my Bliss. Elg. So high I prize thee, by this Virgins kiss. Erk. Yet you make shift to reach him with your lips; Degenerate Princess, I suspect thy birth: Yet well mayst thou be Sister to thy Brother, For Great Canutus blood runs low as thine, and Love-sick doateth on an English Nun. Alu. Then you resolve to fly? Elg. Heaven knows I do. Erk. Here's one will stop your Journey. Thunder part ye, slave. Elg. Ha, O me unfortunate! Alu. Tush, fear not Madam. See here I stand my Lord. Erk. A perjur'd Villain. Alu. That tongue lies that speaks itâHear me, I courted for thee with my best of speech, and shew'd my faith as firm as Adamant, till fate that rules all love, ore-rul'd her so, that she became a Suiter for my love, And on my worthless self her smiles hath thrown; My tongue was yours, but my consent mine own. Erk. Ile have that heart she lovesâhold eyes from weeping. Elg. But I shall hate that heart if in thy keeping. Sheath up thy sword, and hear me Elkinwald, what shall I give thee to renounce my love? Erk. As much as thou would'st give t'attain Elizium sho'd not avert my love from these fair eyes, Joves thunder, or eternal miseries shall never so transform me. Elg. Yet I cannot love thee. Erk. But ile remove the cause of that. Villain, thou hast seen our slaves dye, when their Lords have laugh'd, Come, run on my weapon, this is Princely favor, For greater tortures do attend on thee, But wee'l be merciful in Tyranny. Elg. See, on the Earth, thy Sovereigns Sister kneels, to beg thy pitty. Erk. There's nothing but thy love can purchase it. Elg. Yet have mercy, the fault in love was thine, thou didst betray me when thou let'st me see him; and Villain thou, if thou but touch his life, the Great Canutus shall revenge my wrongs, For after him Elgina will not live; Bethink thee then, O yet some pitty give! Alu. Do not debase your self, for my poor life, I dare his worst, my love is constant still, More resolute to die, than thou to kill. Erk. Tis worthy praise, then see, behold thy death. Alu. With open eyes, as I wo'd view her state, And like a man thus I pursue my fate. (They fight, Elgina goes between, Erkinwald kils her,) Elg. Hold, hold. O I am slain, farewell dear friend, the loss of thee is Tyranny in death And death a dream, so thou but close mine eies. Chaste love is born in Heaven, and never dies. Erk. Amazement to my soul, O my Elgina! O I am most accurst! 'twas this hand struck thee. Alu. For which Ile be revenged; thus Heaven is just. Kills him. Erk. Base Villain thou hast slain me. Alu. 'Tis thy fate. Farewel. Oh pure, unspotted Maid, unhappy Princess, This hand shall keep thy will and close thine eyes, Let thy soul joy, for here thy Murderer lies Dead at my foot, and I with thee could die, Were my poor Country free from misery. War calls me to the field. O my Elgina, Autume is on thy cheeks, the Rose is wither'd, and thou look'st like the Alablaster statue, Upon thy lips I print this parting kiss, And flying from thee, leave all earthly bliss. Exit. Enter Harrold, Osrick, and Captains. Har. Osrick, we hear the Duke of Thetford raiseth men in Norfolk. Osr. All England sure, I think will mutiny, if thus the King neglect his hopeful Conquest, by doating on a womans lustful Beauty. Har. Never was man in love bewitcht like him, he will not suffer speech or any counsel that may dis-swade from her; he bars his right from any but the Nun, and his loose Panders. Ha! what sight is this? Duke Erkinwald and the Princess murdered, this sight wo'd sad even Tyranny it self, draw tears from Tygers, and make wonder dumb. Oh Great Canutus what portents are these This heavy curse lights on thy lust and ease. Thy sister, and thy best of friends are slain, And safety now is frighted from thy Throne. Convey this spectacle of grief aside, and let a guard pursue the murderer. Ile hie me to the King, and there relate Their deaths, his lust, both guided by strong fate. Exeunt. Banquet. Enter K. Canutus. Can. She is an Angel in the shape of woman, chaster than Dian, colder than Freezland snow, and yet she burns me; if I miss her now, my death must be the period of my love, Go, let those Jewels, Cates, perfumes and Musick, be all produc'd together in one sense. Unite all raptures, let's have nothing scant, That she may taste at once, what all Queens want. Musick. Strike heavenly Musick, with a tuneful measure, And with thy raptures swell her blood and pleasure. Enter Cartesmunda and Osrick. The star appears, welcome dear soul, to make our joyes more full, fit to this Banquet, Great Queen of my heart, and fully joy thy senses in each part. Cart. My senses are intranc'd, or do I dream; O let me back return to hide my shame. Can. O stay divinest soul, hear me but speak. Cart. O I have lost my sence with these Inchantments; I am I know not how, for all my powers are useless, but mine eyes to weep. Can. Make not the earth proud to receive thy tears, lest being subject unto me her King, I force her to restore again those pearls, more rich than all the Jewels of our Crown, so high I prize thy tears, yet thee 'bove all. Cart. I am your Servant, Prisoner, Vassal, worse. Can. Thine eyes upon my freedom laid that curse. If thou bee'st mine, I do command thy love; Where Kings of Subjects beg, let pitty move. Cart. How can so great a King, be weakness slave? Can. In doating of those joyes I near shall have. Cart. Men that lust women once, no more indure 'em, In health they loathe the physick that did cure 'em. Can. When I neglect thy love, or touch thy life, may all my Battels prove unfortunate, and I lose all the conquering Danes have got, and end my days with shame and inward grief. Cart. Your words be registred, with hands divine, O keep your vow (great Prince) for I break mine. I blush to say, I yeeld, I'm wholly yours, a spotless Virgin now is in your power, and as you mildly courted, so this kiss confirms mee to you. Can. And my soul to thee. Never did man meet more felicitie. Run Vassals run, prepare all sweet delight For Cartesmunda sleeps with me to night. Enter Harold. England shall sleep in peace, for all my force On Cartesmunda's love shall now be spent, Thy Arms shall be my Arms, thy Bed my Tent. Har. Defend me Heaven, how is this King transform'd? my news is not so sad, as is this sight. Can. Whose there? Harold? what news? Har. The English Princes (mighty Sovereign) seeing your Highness thus forsake the field, threaten fresh war, and England will be lost. Can. But Cartesmunda won, In thee we have all good that England holds, All Conquest in these Arms Canutus folds. Hast more to say? Har. Yes, but with grief (my Lord) The fair Elgina, your beauteous sister, and that only one that made her Sex admit'd, is slain, great King. Canut. Give me this Bracelet, I have begg'd it long. Har. And noble Erkinwald lyes murd'red too. Can. Why now th'art my pretty one, Come, kiss thy Canutus. Har. Had you (my Lord) as I, beheld that sight, the Tyranny of death had sure amaz'd you. Can. What does he talk on? Car. Do you not mark, my Lord; he sayes, Your Sister's dead. Can. Let her be buried then: Remove out of mine eye, thou fright'st my love. Some Musick there: Come Cartesmunda kiss me: Go bid our Souldiers hang their Arms up; Fold up our Ensigns, and unbrace our Drums, England is conquer'd, all our Wars are done, and all in this, that Cartesmunda's won.â Exeunt. Manet Har. Har. O strange Inchantment, the sad news I brought, Though now regardless, whilom would have made his eyes start from their orbs to hear of it: O fair Elgina! happy now th'art dead, and dost not live to see thy brothers folly. This is not now Canutus, nor his Palace, but rather seems a Roman Theatre, and this young Nero acting Comedies, with some light Strumpet in bold scenes of Lust; This change with wonder I behold, and see That love is powerful o're inferior things, When thus to baseness it transforms great Kings.

      <field name="fulltext">Act. III. Enter Grim and Colliers with Baskets and Sacks. Grim. Come Bullies, fetch more Coals, and aboard with 'em lustily, shew your selves Newcastle-men, not proud, but honest and humble, and such as do not scorn to carry Coals. 1 Col. I warrant you Mr. Grim, Wee'l send'em going, Newcastle Coals are Hereticks, and must be burnt at London. Exeunt Colliers. Grim. You say well, Wee'l put'em to water first, and then let'em put fire in their Tayls afterward. Enter Randolph. Rand. Well said Grim, I see thou art not idle. Grim. No Master, I am Bayly of your Cole-pits, and your Worships Benefactor: I will do what lies in a true servant; Seven hundred black Indians, or Newcastle Collyers, your Worship keeps daily to dive for Treasure five hundred fathom deep for you, and as they bring it up, Ile send it out to your profit, Sir. Rand. 'Tis well done Grim, thy gains will one day be a Gentleman. Grim. A Gentleman? Nay I hope one day to purchase a Lordship, and all my Collyers under me shall be Ladies, for Ile maintain'em with black Masks on their faces already; but do you hear Master? I hear there is some disadvantage towards us, and it behoves us to look to't, they say there are a new sort of Colliers crept up neer London, at a place call'd Croydon, that have found out a way by scorching of wood to make Charcoals, and 'tis to be fear'd this may hinder our Traffick Master. Rand. How? To make Coals of wood, art sure 'tis so? Grim. Most certain Sir, but never fear it Master, Newcastle Coals shall conquer Croydon, we can give a Chaldron of Sea-coals for a sack of Char-coals. Rand. Thou say'st well Grim; but I hear my brothers ship's return'd with large Advantage, I mean to see him, mean time insist upon thy care, good Grim. Grim. O sweet Master, Let me go with you, I'd fain see how Thornton our Needle-merchant has sped, I doubt me, his Lambs-skin is turn'd to three Sheeps-skins the wrong side outward. Rand. Come, Let's go; but see they come to us. Enter Goodgift, his Wife, Thornton and George. Good. Now brother Randolph how is't with you Sir? Rand. Glad by the happy tydings of your News Sir; Fame has outstrip'd the wind that brought your ships, and tells us of a rich and prosperous Voyage: Ile talk with your Factor, Sir, and know your Purchase. Good. Do, Do, Mean time Ile talk with Thornton here my honest Merchant of Millan Needles; How hast thou sped in thy Voyage, how didst thou brook the Sea? Grim. I think he was glad to pump over-board; How say you Thornton? Thorn. Tush, Tush, Thou art a Fresh-water Fellow (Grim.) Grim. A Fresh-water Fellow? O disgrace to a Collier! If ever I kill a Whale hand to hand, it shall be thee. Good. Nay, good Grim. Grim. Mr. Goodgift, I pray pardon me: Shall Grim the Collyer that has been thus long Controler of the Cole-pits, chief Sergeant of the Selleridge, nay the very Demigorgan of the Dungeon, be call'd a Fresh-water Fellow? Good. Quietness, I say, Wee'l have no quarrelling. Grim. I beseech you Sir, Let's both be let down into a Cole-pit five Fathom deep, and he that kills the other, shall be stifled with a Damp, and so you shall never be troubled to hang, nor bury us. Good. Go to, I say, Ile have yee friends again: Come, shake hands. Grim. Never, unless I may call him, Porpoise, now at single hand, Sir. Good. I, I, Thou shalt. Grim. Thou? go thy wayes, thou art a Porpoise, and now I am friends with thee. Good. So, So, 'Tis well, and now as I was saying, Thornton, What Voyage hast thou made to benefit thy hopes, your Halfpenny, and your Lambs-skin? My Factor tells me here thou hast been careful and diligent, but to the wealth and greatness you expect, I yet hear nothing. Wife. I marry Husband that's the news I look for; Sir, Come tell us Thornton, How have you bestowed the mony that I gave you? Thorn. Faith Mistriss, as the rest, my full stock to Sea, you, and my good friends gave, was five shillings, and putting in at Preston for fresh water, I turn'd it there into six Tun of Iron, one of which Tuns I have already sold unto an Anchor-Smith here in Newcastle for four pound; the rest, if I put off so well, will multiply my stock most richly, Mistriss. Good. 'Tis well, but far from hope of wealth and Lordships Thornton. Rand. Yet that re-multiplied again, good brother, may help his Halfpenny and his Lambs-skin somewhat. Good. Well, well Thornton, th'art welcome home however; So are thou George; Go see the ship unladed, wee'l go before, and view the Ware-houses. Fac. I shall Sir. Good. Come brother, will you go? Rand. Yes, Sir; You'l quarrel no more, if we leave you together now? Grim. No Sir, I mean to borrow some mony of him now. Rand. That's not his way to thrive; Look to him Thornton. Exeunt. Manent Thorn. Grim. Grim. I warrant you Master, wee'l agree well enough; Ah Sirra, Mr. Thornton, you have got six Tun of Iron already, you must take heed now that you fall not into some crafty Ironmongers hand to deceive you of your whole stock; Look too't, they are hard dealers that deal in Iron; if you be gull'd, remember what Martin said to his man, Whose the Fool now? Thorn. Tush Grim, Look there man, my whole stock lies not in Iron; a little stock I borrowed of my fellow George at Sea, and with it, I have purchased these Pearles. Grim. Pearles? Prethee tell me true: Are they Pearls yfaith? Thorn. Pearles? I, and precious ones too, I hope. Grim. Ha, ha, good Oyster Pearl, worth twelvepence a pound, I think. Thorn. No matter man, I cannot lose by them howsoever; they cost me little; I have sent for a Goldsmith a purpose to know the certainty. Enter a Smith. Grim. That's well, and in the mean time, here comes your first Chapman: How now good man Iron-fist, Why do you puff and blow so? Smith. O Mr. Thornton, I'm ee'n out of breath with seeking you, unless you stand my friend, I shall be undone for ever. Thorn. Why, what's the matter man? Sm. Your Iron, Sir, your Iron, that I bought of you, is not the mettal I took it for, 'twill do me no good Sir, there will not a nayl be hammered out of it, when I heat it, it melts, and when 'tis cold agen, it bends like lead, and if it lye on my hand, I am undone for ever; I beseech you, Sir, take it agen, though I lose ten shillings ith' price I paid for't. Thorn. Nay, I must not rise by hurt of any man; Ile take't agen, and thou shalt lose no penny. I prethee let me see't, Is this a part on't. Sm. I, for here's the end of one of the Bars, the poorest peece of Iron I e're hammered on. Thor. Well, leave this with me, and bear the rest home to my Masters Ware-house, thou shalt sustain no loss, thou shalt have thy mony. Sm. I thank you Sir, Ile bear it back agen, and my wife that yet curseth you most terribly, shall pray for you most horribly. Thorn. This is strange, my great Venture turn'd to nothing now? Grim, Faith Mr. Thonton, and your pearls prove no better than your Iron, you were best turn Merchant of Lambs-skins again. Enter Goldsmith. Thorn. Well I know the worst on't Grim, see here comes the Goldsmith that I sent for; if my Pearls prove as bad as my Iron, I am quite begger'd yfaith. Gold. Now Mr. Thornton what's your business with me? Thor. Your advice in these few pearls sir, and I would know the value of them. Golds. They are fair and round, are they your own sir? Thorn. Ile answer the sail of them. Gold. And have you any more of 'em sir? Thor. Some thirty more, and far more orient than these are too. Golds. Ile give you twenty pound for these two at a venture sir. Grim. You shall have Pearl my dog at that price sir. Gold. What say you Mr. Thornton? Thorn. Twenty pound say y'? there's some hope then towards my half-penny I see. Come sir, Ile make a rash bargain, you are my first Chapman, and shall have first refusal, both in the price of these and all the rest; and since you give me this good comfort, sir, pray let me trouble you a little further, you have good skill in Metals sir, pray look on this; what metal should this be? Golds. Let me see it sir, Ile tell you presently. He touches it with a Touchstone. Grim. A beastly peece of Iron 'tis, it came new from the Forge, old Iron-fist the Smith has been hammering, but he can do no good on't. Thor. What think you sir? Golds. Ha! fore Heaven, it touches fair, have you any store of this metal sir? Thorn. Yes sir, six Tun I assure you, I brought it for good Iron, but my smal skill has deceiv'd me. Golds. You were well deceived sir, for if the rest. Of your six Tun with this in trial stand You're now the richest Subject in the Land. Thor. Ha! Gold? Delude me not I beseech you sir, let me beleeve you plainly. Y'have toucht this peece, and this Ile give you to make good your word. Golds. Upon my life I will, 'tis perfect gold, and for this Wedge I will refine it all to its pure lustre, and your infinite profit. Thorn. I make that bargain with you, this peece is yours, and since you give these hopes, I pray conceal it, and meet me at the Warehouse, there Ile shew you the full six Tun I spake of, and confer. Golds. I will attend you sir, and tell you thus, Your Fortunes all are rich and wonderous. Exit. Thor. I have a thankful heart to heaven for't, that's my comfort: Why how now fellow Grim, how stand'st thou man? Grim. Six Tun of Gold? O that I durst but imbrace you Mr. Thornton! Thorn. Tush man, I prethee do; Ile ne're foget my self nor thee, I am honest Thornton, and thou honest Grim. Grim. Poor Grim the Collier sir, but Ile never be your worships equal, you shall be tryumphant Mr. Thornton, and I poor Grim, your honest friend, and quondam fellow. Thorn. Come, come, no more of this, help me to cast my venture honest Grim: Six tun of gold? Grim. Most right sir. Thor. Three pound an ounce, is threescore pounds a pound. Grim. And that's horrible usury for your worship. Thor. Nay, nay, no worship good Grim, this is Heavens blessing thrown on a poor mans head. Grim. Wo'd I were thrown into a Coal-pit with such a blessing on my back. Thor. Nay prethee let's reckon further, three pound an ounce, and threescore a pound, is full sixteen thousand pound a Tun, and doubling that to six times six, comes near to forty hundred thousand pounds, almost four millions. Grim, O Lord sir! is not that better than twenty millan Needles that your Lordship had wont to sell amongst the Colliers, and when you came to Newcastle, as your writing says, Here did Thornton enter in, with hope, a half-penny, and a Lambs-skin. Thor. True, true, good Grim, and I shall ne'r forget it. Grim. O that my mother had lapp'd me in a Lambs-skin the first hour of my begetting, for now I see there is no luck to a Lambs-skin, six Tun of gold at one purchase, and besides all this your Highness does forget the pearls too. Thor. Nay, nay, no Titles Grim, 'tis all heavens blessing still. Grim. Tis true sir, and I think your Majesty's the richest manâ Thor. Away, away, thou'lt speak Treason anon Grim. The wealth I have I see is infinite, and be thou secret and conceal a while, and Ile reward thee with large recompence. Enter Smith. Grim. I am your Vassal sir, and will be obedient to your Excellence in all things. But see the foolish Smith is return'd to see you. Thor. Prethee be silent. How now honest Smith, hast thou sent home the iron? Smith. O yes sir, I thank Heaven I have rid my hands of it, you have made me a man Mr. Thornton, my house is quiet, my wife silent, I have carried home your leaden iron, return me my silver back agen, and my wife and I shall pray for you when you are dead and rotten. Thor. Well sir, with all my heart. I received four pound; Look you sir, there 'tis, all your full sum to a penny. Smith. Sweet Mr. Thornton, shall I not give you four pots for all this kindness? pray sir, 'tis fit I should lose something. Thor, No, no, I'm satisfied. Grim. Do you hear ancient Iron-fist, the old Smith of Newcastle, I can tell you one thing, if the Almanack or Erra-pater be true, youle hang your self ere to morrow morning. Smith. How, hang my self! Thor. Nay, prethee Grim, thou wilt discover all anon. Grim. No I warrant you sir, I do it but to work a little profit. Do you hear Smith, what shall I give you for the ashes and rubbish that came off of that old Iron that you refused now? Smith. How? the ashes? marry I mean to sweep 'em out of my shop when I come home yfaith, for fear they infect the rest. What wilt thou do with 'em? Grim. That's all one, Let me have all the ashes and the peeces you broke off that Bar your brought to Mr. Thornton, and Ile give thee five shillings. Smith. Five shillings? Ile not be said to gull you Mr. Grim, but an youle give me a groat ready money, th'are yours. Grim. A bargain: There's your groat. Smith. The ashes, and all the peeces of iron are yours sir. Grim. Bear witness Mr. Thornton, come, Ile go fetch 'em presently, y'ad best make haste, your dismal day's to morrow, you know what I told you, and unless you rid your self of 'em quickly, you will hang your self, that's certain. Exeunt. Manet Thornton. Thorn. Ha! Have my hopes ore-tane me? think on't Thornton, and thank Heaven for't; here at Newcastle first In low estate, did Thornton enter in, With hope, a half-penny, and a Lambs-skin, And now my large Accounts, of wealth scarce told, I keep possession of six Tun of gold. The blessings strange, and I must now resolve To tie my vows to my auspicious fate, Lest the world curse, and Heaven call me ingrate; To make of this my gold a houshold God, Were meer Idolatry, no't shall fly abroad: Newcastle, to thy good, large sums of love My promise oweth, which ile pay, and prove, To grace thy fame, Ile beautifie thy ground, And build a wall that shall imbrace thee round. Exit. Musick. Enter Cartesmunda, and discovereth Canutus asleep, Attendants, Osrick. Car. That Musick is too loud, tread softly sirs; How sweetly in his sleep Canutus looks? Ile not envy thee Juno, keep thy Jove, here lies the soul of Cartesmunda's love. Now by this kiss Canutus I do love thee, thou needst not dream it, fie, fie, sluggard fie, beshrew the God of dreams, what, did he fright thee? Or art thou fighting of some battel now, wherein thou seest me taken prisoner, and startst with fear of that? There's nothing else that could afright thee, though it came like thunder, for thou wert made for Armes, and for these Arms; and yet thy sword Canutus did not win me. I saw these eies, when I refus'd to love thee, begin to lose their splendor, and in tears drown their neglected brightness. I have seen this face half dead when I have frown'd upon't, and with my smiles life has return'd agen; go, go, you wanton, by this kiss Ile beat you. Can. How now Sweet-heart? Car. Art thou awake my Love? then I am well. Can. Well Cartesmunda, sleep, and I will watch as careful as the tender Pellican stands by her tender young; give me a kiss potent as Bacchus to raise appetite, and let's go sleep together, if I get a Boy upon thy youth, he shall be King, and half the world shall be his Dower. Knocks within. Whose that knocks so rudely for his death? hath not the slave describ'd the noyse? Enter Hofman. Hof., Osr. It is Duke Harold, sir, intreats access. Can. He does not chuse his time well. Let him in. Enter Harold. Osr. The King is angry sir. Har. Angry, sayst thou? holy Saints defend us, 'has foes enough to vent his spleen upon, and not to shrowd himself thus from his friends. Most mighty Prince. Can. Rise Harold, we co'd chide you; But go on. Har. Pardon (my speech my Lord) it is my duty, and I must needs make bold to tell your Highness, y're no Souldier but a Love-sick Prince, And while you dally out your daies in love, the English all are raising head against you, the Garrisons that kept Northumberland are chas'd as far as York, two thousand Danes, died in that bloody slaughter. And now again those warlike Princes all their Forces joyn, and seek you forth. Can. Fetch me some wine, wee'l drink to all their deaths that dare disturb us; Cartesmunda, thou shalt sweetly pledge me, come faster slave. Dance. Thus in this wine wee'l wash away all care, My pleasures and my conquest all are here. Come pledge me sweet. Har. The Duke of Thetfords Forces raised in Norfolk, have quite expuls'd the Danes, the English Nobles bound to your State by conquest and by oath, forsake Allegiance, and with sound of Drums proclaim Prince Alured the English King. Can. Ho, ha, ha. Cart. Why laughs my Love? Can. To see thee pledge me such a hearty draught. Har. You see my Lord hee's careless, and neither minds us nor his persons safety. Osr. Most Royal sir, what order for your forces? Can. Let's have some musick strait; Come Cartesmunda wee'l dance out half this day, and that being done, we will retire our selves and sleep agen. Why, when yee slaves? do your souls sleep within you? here's good musick. Dance. Har. So was the warlike Drum and Trumpet once, great Hardiknute the glory of the Danes. Thy Son plays now the King. Enter a Captain Capt. Hail mighty King. Can. Thunder to thee; Foot can we not be private? Capt. Alas my Leige my news is of importance. Can. So is my pleasure slave, avoid our presence, thou and the rest that come to fill our ears with tumults and with bloody Massacres, frighting my heavenly Love, for whose sweet sake let men fall thicker than the checker'd leaves, the stern winds rend and ravish from the tree, when yellow Autum turns them into gold. Flourish. Be gone, come Cartesmunda let's retire, We will not stir were all the world on fire. Ex. Osr. Is this the end of all our former conquests? to be re-conquer'd now with wine and women? Har. I, this is she that bears so high a stroak, we dare not shake our heads for fear we loose 'em; if she but dreams a dream that nor delights her, next morning there are some are sure to bleed for't, whose lot so ere it be. Osr. Wo'd it were mine, my Lords, so she co'd dream, and it would come to pass, the Devil might fetch her. Har. This twelve month sir, he has not touch'd his Armor, nor been ith'field to chear his Souldiers. Osr. We now must make as great a suit to see him, as if we beg'd for Tipes of dignity. Cap. No more, I see your griefs and all our ruins, if we keep silent thus. Ile speak to him, and venture life for such a general good, if my plots fail, my tongue shall boldly speak To touch his baseness, though I lose my head, Ile die, or win him from this strumpets bed. Fear not to second me. Har. Not I, were death assur'd, Ile first begin, A Souldiers best fight is to beat down sin. Enter Canutus and a Guard. Can. Double my Guards about her, I will prove There's no happiness on earth but love. Cap. Most mighty Prince. Can. Audacious Traytor, wherefore com'st thou to us, did we not charge thee to avoid the presence. Cap. Your Father (Royal Sir) knew me a Souldier, and I have fought for you, yet if you please, so I may speak, make me your humble Martyr. Can. Slave what wouldst thou say? Cap. That which my life shall prove Y'ave lost your conquest in a womans love. Could you unty the vail Cupid has bound about your eyes and forehead, you wo'd find she were not all so fair as you esteem her, Nature was never so impartial to give to one to rob a million, arm but your self and lead your Souldiers forth to win another City, you shall find her beauty far out-strip'd, sacred Leige, if like a young man you take counsel ill, Destroy me quickly, it shall be my fame I di'd to win you from a Strumpets shame. Can. Thou'st spoke enough to damn thee, Impudent Traytor, go dye unpittied; Though thou hast my hate, thou shalt not have the honor of my sword o take away thy life, you of our Guard; See a base death performed upon this Slave. Capt. Farewel my Leige you once must have a grave. Exit with Guard. Har. My Resolution's firm, and I will speak, though hell shu'd gape to swallow me alive; What's he that's gon to death my Sovereign? Can. A Traytor (Harold) to my best content. Har. O pardon sir, your rage has lost a man of more true worth then all this Nation; He was not of that strain of Counsellors, that like a tust of Rushes in a Brook, bends every way the current turns it self, yeelding to every puff of Appetite that comes from Majesty, but with true zeal he faithfully declared the grief of all: Pardon me (great Canutus) I must speak, and let thy subject on his knee intreat, the Kingly Lion yet to rouze his strength, And chase those English that do only wound, Because our Rescuer will not be found. Can. Fond man, how dar'st thou check our Appetite: Hast thou forgot, our frown can strike thee dead. Har. I know't, and willingly lay down my head; For 'tis more honor by thy wrath to dye, Then living to behold thy misery, Which sure is coming on. Can. Let it make haste. Wee'l beat it back with our triumphant Hoast. Har. You cannot, till you beat that wanton hence; She has bewitch'd your senses (mighty Lord) Her Tresses, like to Adamantine Chains, Have let all heat but lust out of your veyns; When she is gone, your valor you'l assume, But while she stayes, she doth your state consume. Can. No more: Go bid the Captains meet me in the Hall; Tell'em to morrow early wee'l come down; And in strange kind to all your eyes wee'l shew We can command our self as well as you. Away. Har. Ile do your will, and hope for good event. Exit. Can. There is no hell on earth but discontent. I feel my blood grows chil, a sudden qualm in a deep LÃ¦the seems to drown my joyes. Enter Cartes. But here comes she, by whom those thoughts are gon, Earths happiness, at whose creation Nature spent all her stock: Welcome my love to make our joyes full, Go adorn thy self in all the richest Jems my Coffers yeelds; Wear all the Jewels purchas'd with my crown, and out-shine Dian in a Robe of stars. Cart. For what, my Lord? Can. To please mine eyes, and make all men admire thy Radencie. Thy Beauty shall out-brave the glorious Sun, Florish. Somewhat Canu't must do to be talk'd on. Exeunt. Enter Mr. Randolph, and his Sister in Mourning. Rand. Fie Sister, weep no more, 'tis time to lay by grief, and with the death of your late husband, now bury your sorrows. Wife. Shu'd I forget so soon so good a husband? Rand. His goodness was your good, your late dead husband has left you rich, and full Executrix to be over-seen by Mr. Thornton, whose care I cannot pass without some note; For though his wealth be rays'd to Infinites, he not forgets a servants love. Wife. Alas good brother, I have woo'd him from it. Rand. How Sister have you woo'd him? Wife. I, from civility, Methinks 'tis unmannerly in me, to see a man so much in state the better, to be so like a servant to me; I tell you I have woo'd him from it. Rand. I think 'twere better far he woo'd you Sister. Wife. Woo'd me? For what? Rand. For Love Sister. Wife. O fie, good Brother: The very word would wrong my husbands grave. Rand. Tush, a Womans Sorrow, has been in black to day, in green to morrow. Wife. I, but I am none of those: No, no, Ile never marry. Rand. Come, you are foolish, think upon him, Sister, Hee's a rich man, I tell you. Hee's now the wealthest subject England hath. Wife. O but my Husband! Rand. Which of 'em? he that's gone, or this to come? Think of Mr. Thornton. Wife. Alas, I am not his equal: Rand. Tush you were once his Better, hee's humble still. Wife. Well, Ile speak no more on't. Rand. Well, think on't then. Wife. Hey, ho, Hee's a very honest man truly, and had my husband dyed but two months ago, I might ha' thought on't. Rand. How fare you Sister? Wife. As a green widow sir; Pray if you see Mr. Thornton, say I'd speak with him. Enter Thornton and a Workman. Rand. Are you there yfaith Sister; See, hee's here already. Thorn. Spare for no cost, and ply the Workmen hard, Ile pay'em all, they shall not want for mony; have you tane the compass of the Wall? Work. We have, to a foot sir. Thorn. How many Towers of strength may be erected, dividing each distance by a hundred paces. Work. 'Tis cast already, and the compass falls, A hundred fourscore Towers to grace the Walls. Thorn. How high de'you raise the Walls? Work. As you directed sir, full a hundred foot. Thorn. Right, and twelve in breadth. Work. Just so sir, 'twill be a pleasant walk to view the Town: Thorn. So I wo'd have it; And therefore from the highest erect a Battlement above the Platform four foot high a'both sides, both to secure, and make the place more pleasant; See it rais'd so. Work. I shall sir. Wife. O my dear Husband! Thorn. Why, how now Mistriss? Wife. O Mr. Thornton, I never see you, but I think of a good husband. Rand. I marry Sister, that's a pretty cast. Thorn. Your pardon I beseech you gentle Mistriss; Your Factor and my self have summ'd your state, and find it cleerly, all your debts discharg'd, in compleat value fifteen thousand pound. Rand. Ha, ha, Sister, a good Dowry to get a new husband, trust me. Wife. No, no, Ile nere marry again; Ile e'en follow Mr. Thorntons rule, you see he lives a Batchellor. Rand. Sir, Methinks 'twere good you took a wife, and so leave your own to your own posterity. Thorn. In all, Ile take my Mistress counsel: Pray resolve me, Had I, a mind to marry, which in your judgement were the fitter, a Maid, or Widow? Wife. Truly, I think a Widow sir, you may imagine, I may speak somewhat in mine own Flattery; but alas, 'tis a state I shall not change! 'Tis for your good, I speak in love, no hate, A Widow sir, will best secure your state. Thorn. You counsel well Mistriss, and Ile think on't. Wife. The sooner the better too, I can assure you; you'l find much comfort in't, you may elect some young green thing out of a Mayden choyce, that may be fury and froward, she may please your eye a little, and other parts about you, but vex your heart, and be a gulph to swallow your estate; If you'l deal wisely (as I hope you will) take me a Widow, that knows how and what to do, that has been season'd in a husbands usage, and one that will obey as you shall honor: He that will quietly lay down his head, Let him contract a Widow to his bed. And still I say, take me a Widow, sir. Rand. Why, you say honestly Sister; Do you understand her sir; she bids you take her a Widow. Wife. You are merry Brother. Thorn. Nay you said so Mistriss, speak't agen then, for by my Faith, wer't not for two things Mistriss, I'd come a wooing to you. Rand. Two things? Why three things shall not hinder it; What are they? Thorn. My first fear is, the marriage of so much wealth as ours compounded, would choak all content, and with the superflux change all to cares. Rand. You take good course for that already, sir, your charitable works so well begun, will help to disperse the o're-plus freely. Thorn. You have removed that well, the other is, that the remembrance of my poor estate; which is so publickly proclaimed to all men, might make my wealthy Mistriss here disdain me. Wife. Nay, that's your glory, sir, and cannot be accounted as your shame. Rand. Why La sir she has helpt that her self now. Thorn. Yfaith, say then Mistriss (I am a bad Wooer, 'tis my beginning) shall it be a match? Wife. I cannot so forget my late lost husband. Rand. Why, this repairs your losses, Sister, you lost a good one, and find his equal with a wealthy purchase. Thor. Put me in hope that I may once injoy you. Wife. I will not marry, sir, these seven years, trust me. Rand. How? this seven years Sister? fie upon't, we may be all dead and rotten six years before it; come, come, speak in compass sister. Wife, Truely Brother under half a year I won't here on't. Rand. I marry sir, that was well bated. Speak agen Sister, and let it be a fortnight. Wife. A fortnight? no, no, not this month, beleeve me. Ran. Away, away, a months too long, hark you sister, wee'l clap it up privately to night, and the Town shall not know on't till a moneth hence. Wife. To night? O fie upon't! an you love me Brother let it not be till to morrow morning, I beseech you, for the speech of people. Ran. Afraid of wind? tush let it vanish Sister, I say he shall marry thee to night. Thor. Let it be so, and here's an earnest Mistris. Kiss. Wife. Alas I kiss coldly in a morning Gown sir, Thor. Tush it shall off; wee'l marry, then to bed, Wooing is idle, better to be sped. Wife. Use your own will sir. Ran. Why, so, 'tis as it sho'd be now; imbrace him sister, And live in love and wealth, 'bove all admir'd, Here's seven years quickly in an hour expir'd. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. 4. Enter King of Scots, Alured, Malcome, Edmond, and Captains, Drums and Colours. K. Thus far tryumphantly with good success, my Princely friends we have together march'd, and from the North parts quite disperst the Danes, alone the City York holds firm again, whose buildings we will level with the earth, unless they suddenly yeeld up the City; give your advice most Princely Alured, on your fair quarrel all our Fates depend. Alu. Your Highness has been fruitful in your love, bringing the best that Scotland can afford, in honorable Armes to right our wrong, let's forward then, and dare 'em to the Gates, our horses hoofs shall furrow up their Land, and sow the fields with blood instead of corn. 1 Cap. Spoke like the Brother of dead Etheldred, summon 'em to the Wals. Drums beat a parly. Enter Above, Harrold, and Souldiers. Har. The meaning of this Parly. King. Danes yee see all hope of Conquest has forsaken you quite, Two thousand of your stoutest Souldiers are faln already by our conquering swords, if ye will yeeld affirm it, if not death shall in his meagre fury through your Host, revel and catch your Jubile. Then tell us, do you resolve to fight it out or fly. Mal. Or stay and have your throats cut in the fight? Edm. Or leap the wals, and break your necks before us? Mal. Resolve so quickly, and save us a labor. Har. Yes, with immediate speed, set ope the gates And like a torrent on their heads wee'l fall, The Field and Air shall be their burial. King. If there we fall, our fame out-lasts times date On to the field, blest with propitious fate. Exeunt. Alarm, Excursions. Enter King, Alured, Malcome, Edmond, Captains. K. All earthly honors are thine own, fair Prince, and Heaven fights in thy cruse, the Cities taken. Alu. The Danes are all expuls'd and fled for safety. Edm. The Danes are fled from danger, not from shame That still pursues 'em wheresoere they fly And on their Tombs shall live eternally. Mal. Let's seek the Love-sick King Canutus forth, And in one Battel try his valors worth. Alu. That's our intent most noble Malcome, but we must war securely, all their strength will now be bandied to oppose our coming, and therefore whilst you here refresh your Army, Duke Edmond and my self will try our friends, and in these North parts gather up new Forces to aid us 'gainst all Danish stratagems. King. We like it well, assist us gracious Fate, To seat a true Prince in his Royal State. Exeunt. Enter Thornton, Wife, Randolf, the Partners, Workmen, and George, with the table of the writing in golden Letters, and Grims Speech. Part. Y'ave stoln a wealthy marriage Mr. Thornton unwares to all the Town, but we are glad we are so well deceived. Thor. Faith Gentlemen, it was not to abridge the Nuptial Feast, for that shall have his full Solemnity, but from some private causes of my Mistris. Whose power retains all former dutie from me, And as a Servant still she shall command me. Wife. Not so sir, I resign that title now, my self and state are onely by your power to be dispos'd and sway'd. Rand. I, well said sister: This match was richly made, with liking and with joy to all the Country. And Brother Thornton (so Ile call you now) I came prepar'd to give you fit surrender of the last Bargain which you purchas'd of me. Thor. Your Coal-pits and your Servants Brother Randolf. Rand. Yes sir, and look you, this is the Orator must speak for all, in his mouth they have put the Law and willingness they have to serve. Enter Grim. Thor. Who honest Grim? Grim. Yes sir, and I am the Prologue to the Play, And for them all I have to say. Seven hundred men in sable wise, From forth the Coal-pits shall arise, Not melting men made out of wax, But such as use Spade and Pick-ax. Who when you bid 'em use their skils Shall make a Dale of Mauburn hils, Then raise a Mount as high as Poles And turn it strait to burning coals. Thor. This speech I think was pen'd on purpose. Grim. I speak deep things, some sir, of 50 fathom deep, I do it de profoundis, and no disparagement to the Author, that which I have spoken was in as Good ryme as ent'ring in, With hope, a half-penny, and a Lambs-skin. Thor. Ha, ha, thou hit'st me there yfaith. Grim, I give you a taste sir, how you shall find me here, and as for my seven hundred fellowers they are honest Tartarians, and whosoever deals with 'em shall find them grim fellows I assure you. Thor. Grim thou wert always honest, and on my word thy love shall have reward. Baily. Sir, all your works, both finished and intended, are pious, holy, and religious. Part. And in the goodness if you still persever You build your self a house in Heaven for ever. Thor. Heaven have the praise of all, and look ye Gentlemen. Reach me the Table George, I have here repair'st the copy of my first arrival here, which yet hangs up insculp'd on a tileshard; but now 'tis rectifi'd in golden Letters, with the same phrase stil, onely thus alter'd. Here at this West-gate first, came Thornton in Grim. With hope, a halfpenny, and a Lambs-skin. I remember that still sir. Georg. How now Grim, are you so sawcy Sirrah? Thor. 'Tis well done Grim, I'd ha't remembred ever, go place it ore the gate that all may view it, and witness these great blessings heaven has sent. The reason why I urge this Register, To have my memory thus kept in store, Is not my wealth, but to record me poor. Go see it done. Ex. Workmen, George George. For ever may it stand to your renown. Part. And all succeeding fame, While this Town stands still honor Thorntons name. Thorn. Amidst these poor indeavors of my love, my careful Master must not be forgot, whose Heir I am become, and for his sake, I will re-edifie Alhallows Church, where in the peaceful bed of death he sleeps, and build a Tomb for him cut out in Touchstone, which in our Persian Voyage was return'd, from whence my golden Mineral arriv'd. Grim. In the likeness of old iron sir. Thorn. I, thou say'st true Grim. Grim. I have wondered a thousand times old Iron-fist the Smith did not hang himself for refusing the first Tun of it, a whoreson Coxcomb. Wife. They say you got somewhat by it Grim. Grim. Alas Mistris, a few chips or so, some ten pounds worth for a groat, I think I bought on him, Shout, Rand. How now, what mean these shouts? Grim. I think there's some Match at Foot-bal towards, the Colliers against the whole Country cut, and long tail. Enter George Thor. What's the News good George? George Prince Alured and Edmond Duke of Thetford are newly lighted, and desire to speak with the Town Magistrates. Thor. We shall with joy receive him as our Prince, and wish he had as free possession of this whole Kingdom, as this Town shall give him. Enter Alured and Edmond. All. See where he comes; All duty to your Highness. Alu. Rise Gentlemen, we have your hearts, forbear your knees, your true Allegaince hath proclaim'd it self that never yeelded yet to forreign Scepter, you have fortified your walls 'gainst all invasions And in that circuit gloriously she stands With kind imbraces to infold your friends. Thor. Our Town, our selves, our lives are all your homigers, as the most lawful and indubitate Heir, To our late Sovereign Lord, and to your Throne. We fall as Subjects, you we know our own. Alu. My best of thanks is due to my best friends. Which is the man amongst yee Gentlemen that bears the name of Thornton? Thor. Your Subject and your Servant, Royal sir. Alu. Let me imbrace you sir, and tell you this, your goodness speaks you nobly: England is fam'd in this fair Town, much honored by your vertues. Our Countries conquest by these Danish wars Have not such blazon from our shame exhal'd, As these your good deeds now have countervail'd. Thor. I can do nothing but my duty sir. Alu. 'Tis worthy praise in all, and trust me Gentlemen, we have good hope to see a happy day, and once again make England singular, Free in her self and Princes. I came now with my best Hors-manship from the Scotch Army, whose Royal King in Neighbor amity, is arm'd in my just cause, has past the Tweed with prosperous forrage through Northumberland, all Holds and Castles taken by the Danes restore themselves to his subjection in our behalf. The City York is won, from whence I came. Ed. And whilst we forrage thus, their King Canutus, doating on the beauties of Cartesmunda Nun of Winchester, Of his estate so careless now is grown, Hee'l put no arms but Cartesmunda's on. Thor. Go forward noble Princes, your work's good, and to incourage it, ten thousand pounds Ile lend your grace to leavy Souldiers, which if you never pay, Ile never aske, and for my own imployment to your aid, Ile lend (if you will honor me so far) all the full strength Newcastle can afford, I have seven hundred men that call me Master. Grim. Besides Grim the chief Controler sir. Thor. Very true sir, and these Ile four times double, And three months shall their charge be mine alone, To back your Right and seat you in your Throne. Alu. Your bounty and your love exceeds all means of president and recompence. Thor. Tis but my duty still, which Ile not slack, go Grim and muster my seven hundred Colliers, to them ile add two thousand more of our Newcastle strength, and thou shalt be an Officer to conduct 'em. Grim. For a Corporal or so, let me alone with my Squadron, I dare undertake with my seven hundred Colliers in six days, under ground, to march to London, they shall dig their way themselves too. Rand. And know 'tis two hundred miles. Grim. That's nothing, Ile march forty miles a day with 'em at pleasure, there is no Pioneer to be compared to a Collier in his Coal-pit, if youle have a dozen Cities as we go, undermin'd and blown up, give but every man a bushel of Apples to his Breakfast, and you shall hear the wind roar and shake the ground like an Earthquake. Thor. Well sir, wee'l try their valors; go George, get Armor ready, and Grim, get thou a Drum and Marshal 'em. Grim. If you wo'd rake hell and Phlegitan, Acaron and Barrathrum, all those Low Countries cannot yeeld you such a company. Tara, ra, ra, ra, ra, O brave Master, now for a company of conquering Colliers. Come George. Exit. Thor. Now would it please my Leige so far to grace his humble Subjects and their new built Town to take a homely Banquet, we sho'd think 'twere royal Neighborhood to heat our buildings. Alu. We cannot be unkind, though to your hurt, we will dispense with our great hast so long, and then from Banquets unto Battels fly; Which Heaven (we hope) will guide successfully. Exeunt. Enter Harold, Huldrick, Osrick, Captains, and Lords of Denmark. Hul. Go let our Drums and Trumpets spight of fear, thunder aloud i'th Air, and tell Canutus, his Captains do attend to speak with him he promis'd to come down. Har. Yes down toth'earth. Hul. And in the shameful ruins he prepares with lust, and murder, bury up his name, he's known by nothing but a large defame, the City York for want of aid is lost, and still the foe pursues, if thus we stand to sooth him in this sin, our conquest dies. And we in blood must end our victories, 'sfoot sound and call him. Enter Hoffman. Hof. Give your attendance Lords, the King is coming. A flourish, and Drums and Trumpets. Hul. 'Tis time he sho'd, he has been absent long And done his honor, fame, and Country wrong, How did he take your reprehension Harold? Har. It startled him at first, but when with mildness he did appoint this general meeting to us, to what good purpose it inclines I know not: Osr. I hope the best, see here he comes, my Lord. Florish. Enter Canutus leading Cartesmunda, richly attired and deckt with Jewels, Hofman, and Gentlemen attending. Can. Where are our Vassals, attend your charge, and our delight, with all your best of care and diligence, or by those stars whose influence made me great; you dye in Torments all, let not the Sun extort from her bright Rayes, to give him lustre (or if inamor'd as we know he is) unless the Alpes have frozen up his Flames. Let him not on her smooth front dart his heat, No, not for all his glory or arched seat. Omnes. All health and honor to the great Canutus. Can. Rise in our favor, vail thy face my love, we must not have thee seen too much by slaves. Cap. Content, attend the King and his fair love. Osr. Long may she be the Mistriss of his youth: Capt. And give him heaven on earth. Har. And hell to boot: S'death shall we flatter thus? Can: So, now you crouch and fawn like daunted Curs that dare not look the Lion in the face; Come Cartesmunda mount Canutus Throne. Flourish. Let me unvail thy face, and tell me now, which of you all that thus have tax'd my lightness, cu'd (if possest of such a Jem as this) less value it then I: What think'st thou Osrick? Osr. I have not seen the like. Can. Nor ever shall, what Nature had in store was given to her, And can one crown'd with such a heavenly weight, Live and forgo this Center of delight. Hul. Let not these vain Affections (Royal Lord) sway you from reason thus. Can. Ha! What is he? Hul. Do you not know me sir? the time has been, when in thy Battels Huldrick has been seen knee deep in blood, cutting his way by force, careless of life to free thy Royal person, and does your Mightiness not know me now? Then hear the news I bring to comfort you: The Danes once stil'd by Names of Conquerors, are now subdued and slain. The King of Scots banded together with the English forces, have late at York o'rethrown our Garrisons, and now to London match victoriously, defacing all, thy conquer'd Cities burn; And in their falls, the flames do rise so high, They seem to light the Tapers of the skie. And since Fames Trump which oft hath summon'd thee, is not so potent as to draw thee forth, thy honor bids me dare thee to the Field, if thy high spirit be not extinct by Lust: Let's arm our selves for shame. Can. Traytor, thou hast deserved death ere thou dyest; and this thy proud presume shall break thy neck, for chafing our high blood; O love thou art unjust, I feel assaults far sharper in my breast, then all the English Forces, 'gainst this wall; now love and honor, with their opposite powers Afflicts my soul, and with their vertuous strife, Plead for my Love, my Honor, Fame, and Life; With this mans words, my passions strongly move, He for my honor speaks. Honor, but Love I am thy Martyr now, and must go on, For what is Honor but Addition, Got in our pride of youth; yet stay Canutus, think of thy wonted Fame, go on and conquer. Give me my horse, and I will quickly quell 'um. Cartes. What will Canutus do? Can. O Cartesmunda, with that heavenly voyce, already I am chang'd, stern War remains; Kiss me, and kiss me dead, my best of Loves. Osr. Hee's chang'd agen. Hul. This Strumpets eye, does sure bewitch him with her Sorcery; Ile not indure this shame. Enter a Post. Post. Where is my Lord? Can. Where thou shalt not be long: What wouldst thou Villain? Post. Arm mighty Prince, we have descried at hand, the Horse and Ensigns of the English Army, troop'd with their Leaders like the gods of War, who in bright steel, the fields do stoutly bear. Can. And there seek that which thou vile Dog shalt have; Comest thou to fright my Love? Kills him. Hul. Do not expose a mighty Nation, thus naked, to the Tyranny of Lust, Canutus. Can. Traytor. Hul. As thou art great, be just, Let not a Strumpets love, work all our Ruines; the Enemie's at hand, and from thy side; Ile force this painted Whore. Car. Help me Canutus. Hul. What, can you cry? Can. Wer't thou Joves Mynion, slave, thou thus had'st dy'd Canutus runs at him, catches her up in his arms, and runs upon his sword. Hul. Ile meet it thus, And dying so my end is glorious. Car. Oh I am slain! Hul. I have my happy wish then, Welcome death, I dyed (Canutus) to preserve thy breath. Dyes. Can. Sink down to hell; What has my rashness done? O Cartesmunda, stay thy fainting breath, Thou still shalt live with me in spight of death: Car. My Fate is come, great King, my vestal Vow, that broken, with my wish is faln upon me. For your fair love I fayl'd my faith with heaven, And from your hand my death is justly given. Such was my former wish, farewel Canutus. And with my fall may thy great Fame arise, Poor Cartesmunda; thus untimely dyes. Dyes. Can. May all the world dye with thee; now I see The heavens envy an earthly Diety. Har. Brave Huldrick that durst dye for Countries good, And for our freedom spent thy life and blood. Canut. Ha, sit you weeping there; or has Amazement turn'd you into stone, That like men gasping all Medusia's stand, To see my Love thus fall by mine own hand: Our Self will instantly be in the Field, and scourge the English pride and Inhabitants. Sound up our Drum, and call our Troops together, and arm with speed, Ile to the Field, and fight; Farewel dear Love, whom I of life bereft, for which unwilling Act, O pardon me: Canutus arms, a while shall be thy Tomb, Then gold inclose thee till the day of Doom. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. V. At one Door, Enter Canutus, Harold, Captains, with Drum and Colours. At the other, Malcol. Alured, Edm, Drum, with Colours. Can. How harsh these Drums sound now; that once like Musick, did more delight mine ear than Orpheus Lute; Sweet Cartesmunda's death my senses kill, Like one long sick, I relish all things ill. Enter all the Colliers. Har. Courage my Lord, see where the English stand braving your Mightiness: Let's set upon 'em, and never leave till to their mother Earth they pay their lives as Tribute. Now, what sayes Canutus? Can. That ye all are Rebels. Om. Eng. Rebels? Alu. Stay let him speak it out. Can. An hundred thirteen years, the English Kings have paid to Denmark, and our Ancestry an annual Tribute of ten thousand pounds, which you unjustly and rebelliously detain from me, a lawful successor. Alur. 'Tis true Canutus, that the Denmark Kings, so long our native Island hath usurp'd, and whilst they kept within their Danish bounds, and left us to enjoy our own in peace, we justly paid our homage Fealty. But since your Father Hardiknute arose, and you succeeding him, neither content with that our Tribute, but would further seek our utter Extirpation, which five and twenty years you have attempted, planting here your selves in Norfolk, Suffolk, and in Cambridgeshire, erecting Garrisons through all our Kingdom against the Laws of former Articles, we now resolve to spend our Royal blood, and either countervail our former loss, or hazard all we hold, by doubtful battel. Can. That is your answer then? Omnes. Resolvedly for all. Can. Now by the high, and Royal blood of Kings. Edm. Swear by the beauteous Nun of Winchester; you oft have kist that book. Can. And that one word, has rais'd more vigor in my active blood, then ere her beauty flam'd my Appetite to crop the sweets of Love. Mal. It shall be cool'd with better spels than earst her wanton Magick could e're invent to lay thy burning Ardor. All. Danes. Parly no more Canutus. Can. O Cartesmunda from thy gentle Arms, I flye to conquer in Wars rough Alarms. Exeunt. Alarm, Excursions. Enter Canutus and Alured. Can. Why do'st not strike? do'st thou not like thy Aym? or do'st not know me? I am the Danish King, that which all Souldiers seek in bloody War, may here be got on me, eternal honor and easily too, for by the powers that made me, my senses are benummed. Alur. I dare not, nor will take no such Advantage, though I on thee could vent my roughest spleen; pass safe, my Lord, I will not fight with you for your fair Sisters sake, whose love was to me so high and potent, that it did attract her Virgin-thoughts to dart Loves joyes into me, and for the zeal due to her Memory, keep what I co'd take from you, Life and Honor. Can. I prethee take it, Ile yeeld it willingly, and, for I see thou art religious in thy love, let me imbrace thy brest, and of my Love, bright Cartesmunda Nun of Winchester, Ile tell so sad a Tale. Alur. I cannot stay to hear it, hark great Sir, Wars Musick summos me, for Elgina's sake, I slip the Advantage that Fate bids me take. Exit. Can. O for a Midwife, I am big with grief, And fain would be delivered, tho with death. Alarms. Enter Harold, Osrick, Captains, and Souldiers. Har. See where he stands, secure him Souldiers, Never did man so feebly use his sword in such sad times of Terror, O my Lord, can you in all this danger be thus calm? Os. Though you neglect your self, yet prize your honor, or if not that, yet for your subjects sake, be pleas'd to re-assume your wonted valor. Can. Can he be valiant that's without a heart? or can a senseless Trunck have sense of Loss? Such have you made me, therefore share the gain, And to these English leave your Lives and Fame. All. There is no way but Flight. Can. Thank your selves for't; had Cartesmunda liv'd, and grac'd mine Attempts, but with a smile; these English, would as soon take part with those that from Olympus strove to pluck down Jove, as look upon Canutus sound Retreat, the blood of Cartesmunda stirs the gods for this Revenge; and if this may appease her angry soul, we get by losing it; Do what yee will, for I will never more taste joy on earth; her death makes all things poor. Omnes. What shall we do? Har. What else, but fight and dye, And in our deaths hide all our Infamy. Alarm. Enter Thornton, Randolph, and the Colliers, they fight and take Canutus prisoner, and drive out the rest. A Florish and a Retreat sounded. K. Scots. Enter Alured, Donald, Malcolme, Edmond, Thornton, with prisoners, Grim, and the Colliers, leading Canutus, and Osrick. K. Thus from the usurped Temples of Canutus, we take the English Crown and plant it here, to whom in right it legally belongs. Princes and Souldiers, now with me proclaim Victorious Alured, Englands Sovereign. Omnes. Long live great Alured our lawful King. Florish: Alur. First to all-helping heaven due thanks we give, Then next to you, by whom our glories live. Grim. 'Twas I that took him prisoner, my Lord, the Colliers are the Conquerors. Alu. We will reward your Valours. Har. Propose a ransome Royal Alured, to sad Canutus and his Country-men. Can. Give me no Ransom sir, O let me dye, in Cartesmunda's death I brake my vow, and for her sake I have neglected all, and willingly have sought mine own sad ruine; Ile have no Ransom, Cartesmunda's dead, let me be buried with her, that's all the mercy I now will beg of thee from all thy Conquests. Alu. No great Canutus, for I pitty thee, I call to mind thy Royal Sisters love, beauteous Elgina, worthier then thy Nun, whose loving heart was once unbosom'd here, and for her sake, Ile like a brother use thee, this one condition frees thee ransomless, that you abate the Fealty we paid you, you shall return unto your State in Denmark, and henceforth even as brothers wee will live, exchanging Embassies of Love and Honor. And now to you my worthy Country-men it shall be texted to your lasting fame, that your Newcastle strength set England free in this dayes fair and happy Victory, for which, and for thy sake (most worthy Thornton) wee'l give a lasting honor to the Town, now beautified by thee with Wals and Towers to which wee'l add all noble priviledge belonging to a Town Incorporate; and for your former Government of Poretereans, we here establish it a Majoralty, and Thornton as the first we here create Mayor of Newcastle, and give thee the power to elect a brotherhood of Aldermen, with choice of Sheriffs to assist thy Government, your Charter shall be drawn with fullest strength, Even with the fairest Cities of our Land, This Sword confirms it from King Alureds hand; Bear it before ye still. Thorn. Your Highness gives us honor 'bove our Merits. Alur. We have not yet done all, but what we want, wee'l study to requite to thee and them. Grim. Then since your grace is got into the giving Vain, I beseech you sir, Let Corporal Grim be bold to put a Colliers request into one of your ears. Alur. What's that Grim? Grim. Only this sweet King, I that for thy service sake was Corporal to be Warden of your Coal-Carriers, to provide Coals, Surreverence, for your Highness own tooth, Ile promise you weight and measure, if none of your Officers do purloyn, and warm their Noses at your fires in their own Chimnies. Alu. A reasonable Request: Thou art our Coal-carrier. Grim. Nay, Ile carry no Coals neither, I can tell you, and yet I have another Chaldron of curtesies to desire from your kindness, that in remembrance of Newcastle Colliers that have fought so bravely, we may from henceforth have the upper shoulder, and the wall of Croydon Colliers, and that if ever they be found with a Goose in their sacks, they may be made to stand a whole Market day in the Bakers Pulpit, because they shewed themselves Cowards to their Country, and durst not fight against the Danes, as we have done. Alur. All this is granted sir. Grim. Then stand thy ground, old Coal of Newcastle, and a fig for Croyden. Alur. How now, still sad Canutus? We now must war with love, to raise this siege, which we will do with Banquets, and with Revels. Great King of Scotland, we are yet a debtor to your kind love, which thus we 'gin to pay, all those our Northern borders bounding on Cumberland, from Tine to Tweed, we add unto your Crown, so 'twas fore-promised, and 'tis now perform'd; Most fit it is that we be ever lovers; The Sea that binds us in one Continent, Doth teach us to imbrace two hearts in one, To strengthen both 'gainst all invasion. Look up Canutus, now all's cleer above, Let Cartesmunda dye in our new love; And let swift fame thy former glories ring, And hide the follies of a Love-sick King. Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
