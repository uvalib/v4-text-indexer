      <field name="fulltext">ANTECHRISTE De celso throno poli, pollens clarior sole, age vos monstrare [descendi], vos judicare. Reges et principes sunt subditi sub me viventes. Sitis sapientes vos, semper in me credentes et faciam flentes gaudere atque dolentes. Sic omnes gentes gaudebunt in me sperantes. Descendi praesens rex pius et perlustrator, princeps aeternus vocor, Christus, vester salvator. All leedes in land nowe be light that wilbe ruled throughout the right. Your saviour nowe in your sight here may you saffelye see. Messias, Christ, and most of might, that in the lawe was you beheight, all mankind to joye to dight ys commen, for I am hee. Of me was spoken in prophecye of Moyses, Davyd, and Esaye. I am hee the call messye, forbyar of Israell. Those that leeven on me steadfastlye, I shall them save from anoye, and joye right as have I with them I thinke to deale. De me dicitur Ezechielis tricesimo sexto: âTollam vos de gentibus et congregabo vos de universis terris, et reducam vos in terram vestram.â But one hath ligged him here in land, Jesu he height, I understand. To further falsehood he can found and fard with fantasye. His wickednes hee would not wond tyll he was taken and put in band and slayne through vertue of my sond. This ys sooth, sickerlye. My people of Jewes he could twynne that there land came the never in. Then on them nowe must I mynne and restore them agayne. To buyld this temple wyll I not blynne, as God honored be therein, and endelesse wayle I shall them wynne, all that to me benne bayne. De me enim dicitur in psalmo: âAdorabo ad templum sanctum tuum in timore tuo.â One thinge me glades, be you bould. As Danyell the prophett before me tould, all women in world me love should when I were come in land. This prophecye I shall well hould which ys most likinge to yonge and ould. I thinke to fast manye hould and theire fayrenes to found. Also he tould them, leeve you mee, that I of gyftes should be free, which prophecye donne shalbe when I my realme have wonnen; and that I should grant men postee, ryved ryches, land and feeâ hitt shalbe donne, that you shall see, when I am hither commen. âDabit eis potestatem, et multis terram dividet gratuito.â Danielis decimo tertio. What saye you kinges that here be lent? Are not my wordes at your assent? That I am Christe omnipotent, leeve you not this eychon? PRIMUS REX Wee leeven, lord, withouten lett, that Christ ys not common yett. Yf thou be hee, thou shalbe sett in temple as God alonne. SECUNDUS REX Yf thou bee Christe called messie that from our bale shall us bye, doe before us maistrye, a signe that wee may see. TERTIUS REX Then will I leeve that yt ys soe. Yf thou doe wonders or thou goe soe that thou save us of our woe, then honored shalt thou bee. QUARTUS REX Fowle have we leeved manye a yeare and of our weeninge binne in were. And thou be Christe commen here, then may thou stynt all stryffe. ANTECHRISTE That I am Christ and Christ wilbe by verey signe soone shall you see, for dead men through my postee shall ryse from death to liffe. Nowe wyl I turne, all through my might, trees downe, the rootes uprightâ that ys marveyle to your sightâ and fruyt groinge upon. So shall they growe and multiplye through my might and my maisterye. I put you owt of heresye to leeve me upon. And bodyes that binne dead and slayne, yf I may rayse them up agayne, then honoures mee with might and mayne. Then shall no man you greeve. Forsoothe, then after will I dye and ryse agayne throwe my postee. Yf I may doe this marveylouslye, I read you on me leeve. Men buryed in grave you may see. What maistrye ys nowe, hope yee, to rayse them up throwe my postye and all through my owne accorde? Whether I in my godhead bee by verey signe you shall see. Ryse up, dead men, and honour me and knowe me for your lord. Tunc resurgent mortui de sepulchris. PRIMUS MORTUUS A, lord, to thee I aske mercye. I was dead but nowe live I. Nowe wotte I well and witterlye that Christe ys hither commen. SECUNDUS MORTUUS Him honour wee and all men, devoutlye kneelinge on our kneene. Worshippe be thou there amen. Crist, our [knave], ys commen. ANTECHRISTE That I shall fulfill Whollye Wrytte you shall wotte and knowe well hitt, for I am wall of wayle and wytt and lord of everye land. And as the prophett Sophonye speakes of mee full wytterlye I shall rehearse here readelye that clarkes shall understand: âExpecta me in die resurrectionis meae in futurum quia judicium ut congregem gentes et colligam regna.â Sophoni 3. Nowe will I dye, that you shall see, and ryse agayne through my postee. I will in grave that you put mee and worshippe me alonne. For in this temple a tombe ys made, therein my bodye shall be layde. Then will I ryse as I have saydeâ take tent to me eycheone! And after my resurrection then will I sitt in greate renowne and my ghooste send to you downe in forme of fyre full soone. I dye, I dye! Nowe am I dead! PRIMUS REX Nowe sythe this worthye lord ys deade and his grace ys with us leade, to take his bodye yt ys my reade and burye yt in a grave. SECUNDUS REX Forsoothe, and so to us he sayde in a tombe he would be leade. Nowe goe we further, all in a brayde; from disease hee may us save. Tunc transeunt ad Antechristum. TERTIUS REX Take we the bodye of this sweete and burye hit lowe under the greete. Nowe, lord, comfort us, we thee beseech, and send us of thy grace. QUARTUS REX And yf hee ryse soone through his might from death to liffe, as hee beheight, him will I honour both daye and night as God in everye place. Tunc recedent de tumulo usque ad terram. PRIMUS REX Nowe wotte I well that he ys dead, for nowe in grave we have him lead. Yf he ryse as hee hath sayde, hee ys of full great might. SECUNDUS REX I cannot leeve him upon but yf hee ryse himselfe alonne as hee hath sayde to manye one, and shewe him here in sight. TERTIUS REX Tyll that my savyoure bee rysen agayne, in fayth my harte may not bee fayne tyll I him see with eye. QUARTUS REX I must mourne with all my mayne tyll Christ be rysen up agayne and of that miracle make us fayne. Ryse up, lord, that we maye see. Tunc Antechristus levat corpus suum surgens a mortuis. ANTECHRISTUS I ryse! Nowe reverence dose to mee, God glorified created of degree. If I be Christe, nowe leeve yee and worche after my wise. PRIMUS REX A, lord, welcome most thou bee. That thou arte Godd nowe leeve wee. Therefore, goe sytt up in thy see and keepe our sacrafice. Tunc transeunt ad Antechristum cum sacrificio. SECUNDUS REX Forsoothe, in seate thou shalt be sett and honored with lambe and geat as Moyses lawe that lasteth yett, as hee hath sayde before. TERTIUS REX O gratiouse lord, goe sytt downe then, and wee shall kneelinge on our kneene worshippe thee as thy owne men and worke after thy lore. Tunc anscendit Antechristus ad cathedram. Hither wee be commen with good intent to make our sacrifice, lord excellent, with this lambe that I have here hent, kneelinge thee before. Thou grant grace to doe and saye that yt be pleasinge to thee aye, to thy blysse that come wee maye and never from yt be lore. ANTECHRISTUS I lord, I God, I high justice, I Christ that made the dead to ryse! Here I receave your sacrifice and blesse you fleshe and fell. Tunc recedent Antechristo. I will nowe send my holye ghooste. You kinges, also to you I tell to knowe me lord of mightes moste of heaven, yearth, and hell. Tunc emittet spiritum, dicens âDabo vobis cor novum et spiritum novum in medio vestri.â SEVERALIS REX A, God! A, lord mycle of might! This holye ghoost is in me pight. Methinkes my harte ys verey light syth yt came into mee. PRIMUS REX Lord, wee thee honour daye and night for thou shewest us in sight right as Moyses us beheight. Honored most thou be. ANTECHRISTUS Yett worthye workes to your will of prophecye I shall fulfill. As Danyell prophecied you untyll that landes I shall devise, that prophecye yt shalbe donne and yt you shall see right soone. Worshipps me all that ye mon and doe after the wise. You kinges, I shall advance you all, and, because your regions be but smale, citties, castells shall you befall, with townes and towers gaye; and make you lordes of lordshipp fayre, as well yt fall for my power. Yea, looke you doe as I you leere and herkens what I saye. I am verey God of might. All thinges I made through my might, sonne and moone, daye and night. To blysse I may you bringe. Therefore, kinges noble and gaye, token your people what I sayeâ that I am Christ, God vereyâ and tell them such tydinge. My people of Jewes were put mee from. Therefore great ruthe I have them one. Whether the will leeve me upon I will full soone assaye. For all that will leeve me upon, worldlye welth shall them fall one and to my blysse the shall come and dwell with mee for aye. And the giftes that I beheight you shall have, as ys good right. Hence or I goe out of your sight eichone shall knowe his dole. To thee I give Lombardee; and to thee Denmarke and Hungarye; and take thou Pathmos and Italie; and Roome yt shalbe thine. SECUNDUS REX Grantmercye, lord, your giftes todaye! Honour we will thee alwaye, for wee were never so rych, in good faye, nor nonne of all our kynne. ANTECHRISTUS Therefore be true and stidfast aye, and truely leeves on my lawe, for I will herken on you todaye, stydfast yf I you fynde. Tunc resedet Antechristus et venient Enock et Helias. ENOCK Almightie God in majestie, that made the heaven and yearth to bee, fyre, water, stonne, and tree, and man through thy mightâ the poyntes of thy privitie any yearthlye man to see ys impossible, as thinkes mee, for anye worldelye wight. Gratiouse lord, that art so good, that who so longe in fleshe and blood hath granted lyffe and heavenlye foode, lett never our thoughtes be defyled; but give us, lord, might and mayne, or wee of this shrewe be slayne, to converte thy people agayne that hee hath thus beguiled. Sythe the worldes begininge I have lyved in great likynge through helpe of high and heaven kinge in paradice withowt anoye, tyll we hard tokeninge of this theves comynge that nowe on yearth is rayninge and doth Goddes folkes destroye. To paradice I was taken that tyde, this theeffe his comynge to abyde, and Helye my brother, here mee besyde, was after sent to mee. With this champion we must chide that nowe in worlde walketh wyde, to disproove his pompe and pryde and payre all his postee. HELIAS O lord, that madest all thinge and longe hath lent us livinge, lett never the devylls power springe this man hath him within. God gyve you grace, old and yonge, to knowe disceate in his doinge, that you maye come to that likinge of blysse that never shall blynne. I warne you, all men, wytterlye, this ys Enock, I am Helye, binne common his errours to destroye that hee to you nowe shewes. Hee calles himselfe âChristeâ and âMessyeâ. Hee lyes, forsooth, apertlye. Hee ys the devyll, you to anoye, and for nonne other him knowes. PRIMUS REX A, men, what speake you of Helye and Enocke? The binne both in companye. Of our blood the binne, wytterlye, and wee binne of there kynde. QUARTUS REX Wee readen in bookes of our lawe that they to heaven were idrawe and yett binne thereâys the common sawe wrytten, as men may fynd. ENOCK Wee binne those men, forsooth iwysse, common to tell you doe amysse, and bringe your soules to heaven-blysse yf yt were anye boote. HELIAS This devylls lymme that common ys, that sayth heaven and yearth ys his, nowe wee be readyeâleeve you thisâ agaynst him for to moote. PRIMUS REX Yf that wee here wytt mon by prooffes of disputacon that you have skyll and reason, with you wee wyll abyde. SECUNDUS REX And yf your skylles may doe him downe, to dye with you we wilbe bowne in hope of salvatyon, whatever may betyde. ENOCK To doe him downe wee shall assaye through might of Jesu, borne of a maye, by right and reason, as you shall saye, and that you shall well here. And for that cause hither were we sent by Jesu Christe omnypotent, and that you shall not all be shent. Hee bought you all full deare. Be gladd, therefore, and make good cheare, and I doe reede as I you leere, for wee be commen in good maneere to save you everychone. And dreade you not for that false feynde, for you shall see him cast behinde or wee departe and from him wend, and shame shall light him one. Et sic transibunt Enock et Helias ad Antechristum. ENOCK Saye, thou verey devylles lymme that syttes so grysely and so grymeâ from him thou came and shalt to him, for manye a soule thou deceaves. Thou hast deceaved men manye a daye and made the people to thy paye, and bewitched them into a wronge waye wickedlye with thy wyles. ANTECRISTUS A, false faytures, from me yee flee! Am not I most in majestie? What men dare mayne them thus to mee or make such distance? HELIAS Fye one thee, fayture, fye on thee, the devylls owne nurrye! Through him thou preachest and hast postee a while, through sufferance. ANTECHRISTUS O you ypocrytes that so cryne! Loselles, lardans! Lowdlye you lyne! To spill my lawe you aspine. That speeche ys good to spare. You that my true fayth defyne and needeles [my folke] devyne, from hence hastelye; but you hence hyne, to you comes sorrowe and care. ENOCK Thy sorrowe and care come on thy head, for falsely through thy wicked read the people ys put to pyne. I would thy bodye were from thy head, twentye myle from yt layde, tyll I hit brought agayne. ANTECHRISTUS Owt on the, roysard, with thy wyles, for falselye my people thou begyles. I shall thee hastely honge, and that lurdayne that standes thee bye; hee puttes my folke to great anoye with his false flatteringe tonge. But I shall teach you curtesye, your savyour to knowe anonne in hye, false theeves with your heresye, and yf you darre abyde. HELIAS Yes, forsoothe, for all thy pryde, here we purpose for to abyde through grace of God almight. And all the world that ys so wyde shall wonder on thee on everye syde soone in all mens sight. ANTECHRISTUS Owt one you, theeves both too. Eyche man may see you be so all by your araye, muffeled in mantelles. Non such I knowe. I shall make you lowt full lowe or I departe you all froo, to knowe mee lord for aye. ENOCK Wee bee no theeves, wee thee tell, thou false fyend common from hell. With thee wee purpose for to mell, my fellowe and I in feare, to knowe thy power and thy might as wee these kinges have behight, and thereto wee be readye dight that all men nowe maye heare. ANTECHRISTUS My might is most, I tell to thee. I dyed, I rose through my postie. That all these kinges sawe with theire eye, and everye man and wyefe. And myracles and marveyles I dyd also. I counsell you, therefore, both too, to worshippe me and noe moe, and lett us nowe noe more stryve. HELIAS The were no myracles but mervelles thinges that thou shewed unto these kinges through the fyendes crafte. And as the flower nowe springes, falleth, fadeth, and hanges, so thy joye; nowe yt raygnes that shalbe from thee rafte. ANTECHRISTUS Owt on thee, theeffe, that syttes so styll! Whye wilt thou not one word speake them tyll that commen me to reprove? DOCTOR O lord, maister, what shall I saye then? ANTECHRISTUS I beshrewe both thy knen. Art thou nowe for to ken? In fayth, I shall thee greeve. Of my godhead I made thee wyse and sett thee ever at micle pryse. Nowe I would feele thy good advyse and heare what thou would sayen. These lowlers, the would fayne me greeve and nothinge one me the will leeve, but ever be readye me to repreeve and all the people of my lawe. DOCTOR O lord, thou art so micle of might, meethinke thou should not chyde ne fight; but curse them, lord, through thy might. Then shall they fare full yll. For those whom thou blesses, they shall well speede, and those whom thou cursest, they are but deade. This ys my counsell and my reade, yonder heretikes for to spill. ANTECHRISTUS The same I purposed, leeve thou mee. All thinges I knowe through my postee. But yett thy wytt I thought to see, what was thyne intent. Hit shalbe donne full syckerlye; the sentence given full openlye, with my mouth, truelye, upon them shalbe hent. My cursse I gyve you, to amend your meeles, from your head to your heeles. Walke yee furth, in the xx devylles waye. ENOCK Yea, thou shalt never come in coelis, for falselye with thy wyles the people are put in pyne. ANTECHRISTUS Owt on you, theeves! Whye fare yee thus? Whether had you leaver have, payne or blysse? I maye you save from all amys. I made the daye and eke the night and all thinges that are on yearth growingeâ flowes fayre that freshe can springe; also I made all other thingeâ the starres that be so bright. HELIAS Thou lyest! Vengeance on thee beefall! Owt on thee, wretche! Wroth thee I shall! Thou callest thee âkingeâ and âlord of allâ; a fyend ys thee within. ANTECHRISTUS Thou lyest falselye, I thee tell. Thou will be dampned into hell. I made thee man of flesh and fell, and all that ys lyvinge. For other godes have yee nonne. Therefore worshippe mee alonne, the which hath made the water and stonne, and all at my lykinge. ENOCK Forsoothe thou lyest falselye. Thou art a fyende common to anoye Goddes people that stande us bye. In hell I would thou were. HELIAS Fye on thee, fellonne, fye on thee, fye! For all thy wytchcrafte and sorcerye, to mote with thee I am readye, that all the people may heare. ANTECHRISTUS Owt on you, harlottes! Whence come yee? Where have you anye other god but mee? ENOCK Yes, Christe, God in Trynitie, thou false fayture attaynt, that sent his Sonne from heaven-see that for mankynde dyed on roode-tree, that shall full soone make thee to flee, thou fayture false and faynt. ANTECHRISTUS Rybbauldes, ruled owt of raye! What ys the Trinitye for to saye? HELIAS Three persons, as thou leeve may, in on godhead in feereâ Father and Sonne, that ys noe naye, and the Holye Ghoost styrringe aye. That ys one God verey; binne all three named here. ANTECHRISTUS Owt on you, theeves! What sayen yee? Wyll you have on God and three? Howe darre you so saye? Madmen, madmen! Therfore leeve on mee that am on godâso ys not hee! Then may you lyve in joye and lee, all this land I darre laye. ENOCK Naye, tyrand! Understand thou this: withowt beginyge his godhead ys and also without endinge, iwys. Thus fullye leeven wee. And thou that ingendered was amys haste beginynge and nowe this blys, and end shall haveâno dread there ysâ full fowle, as men shall see. ANTECHRISTUS Wretches! Gulles! You be blent. Goddes Sonne I am, from him sent. Howe dare you maynteyne your intent, syth hee and I bee one? Have I not, syth I came him froo, made the dead to speake and goe? And to men I sent my ghoost alsoe that leeved mee upon. HELIAS Fye on thee, fellonne, fye on thee, fye! For through his might and his majestie, by sufferance of God almightie, the people are blent throwe thee. Yff those men be raysed wytterlye withowt the devylles fantasye, here shalbe prooved apertlye that all men shall see. ANTECHRISTUS Ah, fooles! I read you leeve mee upon that myracles have shewed to manye on, to the people everychone, to put them owt of doubt. Therefore I read you hastelye convertes to me most mightie. I shall you save from anoye, and that I am abowt. ENOCK Nowe of thy miracles would I see. HELIAS Therefore common hither be wee. Doe what ys thy great posteeâ and some thereof to leere. ANTECHRISTUS Soone may you see, yf you wyll abyde, for I wyll neyther fight nor chyde. Of all the world that ys so wyde, therein ys not my peare. ENOCK Bringe forth those men here in our sight that thou hast reysed agaynst the right. Yf thou bee so micle of might to make them eate and drynke, for verey God we will thee knowe such a signe yf thou wylt shewe, and doe thee reverence on a rowe all at thy likynge. ANTECHRISTUS Wretches, dampned all bee yee, but nought for that yt falleth mee, as gratyouse god abydinge bee, yf you wyll mend your liefe. You dead men, ryse through my postye. Come eate and drynke, that men may see, and prove me worthye of deitee; so shall we stynt all stryffe. PRIMUS MORTUIS Lord, thy biddinge I will doe aye and for to eate I will assaye. SECUNDUS MORTUUS And I also, all that I maye, wyll do thy byddinge here. HELIAS Have here breadd both too. But I must blesse yt or yt goe, that the fyend, mankyndes foe, on hit have no power. This bread I blesse with my hand in Jesus name, I understand, the which ys lord of sea and land and kinge of heaven on hie. In nomine Patrisâthat all hath wroughtâ et Filii virginisâthat deare us boughtâ et Spiritus Sanctiâys all my thoughtâ on God and persons three. PRIMUS MORTUUS Alas, put that bread out of my sight! To looke on hit I am not light. That prynt that ys uppon hit pight, hit puttes me to great feere. SECUNDUS MORTUUS To looke on hit I am not light. That bread to me yt ys so bright and ys my foe both daye and night, and puttes me to great deare. ENOCK Nowe you men that have donne amys, you see well what his power ys. Convertes to him, I read iwys, that you on roode hath bought. TERTIUS REX A, nowe we knowe appertlye wee have binne brought in heresye. With you to death we will forthye, and never efte torne our thought. QUARTUS REX Nowe, Enock and Helye, yt ys no naye. You have taynted the tyrant this same daye. Blessed be Jesu, borne of a maye! On him I leeve upon. PRIMUS REX Thou fayture feard with fantasye, with sorcerye, wytchcraft, and nygromancye, thou hast us lead in heresye. Fye on thy workes eychone! SECUNDUS REX Jesu, for thy mycle grace, forgyve us all our trespasse and bringe us to thy heavenlye place as thou art God and man. Nowe am I wyse made through thy might. Blessed be thou, Jesu, daye and night! This greesely groome greetes him to fight, to flea us here anonne. TERTIUS REX Of our lyves lett us not wreache, though we be slayne of such a wretche, for Jesus sake, that maye us teache our soules to bringe to blys. QUARTUS REX That was well sayd, and soe I assent. To dye, forsooth, ys myne intent for Christes love omnypotent, in cause that ys rightwyse. ANTECHRISTUS A, false faytures, turne you nowe? You shall be slayne, I make avowe; and those traytors that so turned you, I shall make them unfayne, that all other by verey sight shall knowe that I am most of might, for with this sword nowe wyll I feight, for all you shall be slayne. Tunc Antechristus occidet Enock et Heliam et omnes reges conversos cum gladio et redibit ad cathedram; cum dicat Michaell cum gladio in dextera sua. MICHAEL ARCHANGELUS Antechriste, nowe ys common this daye. Reigne no lenger nowe thou maye. Hee that hath led thee alwaye, nowe him thou must goe to. No more men shall be slayne by thee. My lord will dead that thou bee. Hee that hath gyven thee this postee thy soule shall underfoe. In synne ingendered first thou was. In synne ledd thy lyffe thou hasse. In synne an end nowe thow mase that marred hasse manye one. Nowe thou shalt knowe and wytt in hie that more ys Goddes majestie then eke the dyvell and thyne therebye, for nowe thow shalt be deade. Thou hase ever served Sathanas and had his power in everye place. Therefore thou gettes nowe no grace. With him thou must gonne. Tunc Michael occidet Antechristum et in occidendo clamat Antechristus âHelpe, helpe, helpe, helpe!â ANTECHRISTUS Helpe, Sathanas and Lucyfere! Belzebubb, bould batchellere! Ragnell, Ragnell, thou art my deare! Nowe fare I wonder evyll. Alas, alas, where ys my power? Alas, my wytt ys in a weare. Nowe bodye and soule both in feare and all goeth to the devyll. Tunc morietur Antechristus et venient duo demones et dicunt ut sequitur: PRIMUS DEMON Anonne, mayster, anonne, anone! From hell-ground I hard thee grone. I thought not to come myselfe alonne for worshippe of thine estate. With us to hell thou shalt gonne. For this death wee make great mone. To wynne more soules into our wonneâ but nowe yt ys to late! SECUNDUS DEMON With mee thou shalt. From mee thou come. Of mee shall come thy last doome, for thou hast well deserved. And through my might and my postee thou hast lyved in dignitie and many a soule deceyved. PRIMUS DEMON This bodye was gotten by myne assent in cleane whooredome, verament. Of mother wombe or that he went, I was him within and taught him aye with myne intent synne, by which hee shalbe shent. For hee dyd my commaundement, his soule shall never blynne. SECUNDUS DEMON Nowe, fellowe, in fayth great mone wee maye make for this lord of estate that standes in this steed. Manye a fatt morsell wee had for his sake of soules that should have bine savedâin hell be the hydd! Tunc capient animam eius, et potius corpus. PRIMUS DEMON His soule with sorrowe in hand have I hent. Yee, pennance and payne soone shall hee feele. To Lucyfere, that lord, yt shalbe present that burne shall as a brande; his sorrowe shall not keele. SECUNDUS DEMON This proctor of prophecye hath procured manye one one his lawes for to leeve, and lost for his sake theire sowles be, in sorrowe, and his shalbe soone. Such maistries through my might manye on I do make. Posteaquam demones loqunti sunt, resurgens Enock et Helias ab Antechristo [coesi] et auditoribus status suos commonstrabunt. PRIMUS DEMON With Lucyfere, that lord, longe shall he lenge; in a seate aye with sorrowe with him shall he sytt. SECUNDUS DEMON Yea, by the heeles in hell shall hee henge in a dungeon deepe, right in hell-pytt! PRIMUS DEMON To hell wyll I hye withowt anye fayle, with this present of pryce thither to bringe. SECUNDUS DEMON Thou take him by the toppe and I by the tayle. A sorrowfull songe, in fayth, shall hee singe. PRIMUS DEMON A, fellowe, a dole looke that thow deale to all this fayre companye, hence or thou wend. SECUNDUS DEMON Yea, sorrowe and care ever shall the feele. In hell shall they dwell at theire last ende. ENOCKE A, lord, that all shall leade and both deeme the quycke and deade! That reverence thee, thou on them reade and them through right releaved. I was deade and right here slayne, but through thy might, lord, and thy mayne thou hast me reased up agayne. Thee will I love and leeve. HELIAS Yea, lord, blessed must thou bee. My flesh glorifyed nowe I see. Wytt ney sleight agaynst thee conspired may be by noe waye. All that leeven in thee stydfastlye thou helpes, lord, from all anoye, for dead I was and nowe lyve I. Honored be thou aye! MYCHAELL Enock and Helye, come you anon. My lord wyll that you with mee gonne to heaven-blysse, both blood and bone, evermore there to bee. You have binne longe, for you bynne wyse, dwellinge in yearthly paradyce; but to heaven, where himselfe ys, nowe shall you goe with mee. Tunc abducens eos ad coelos, cantabit Angelus âGaudete justi in dominoâ etc. Finis</field>
