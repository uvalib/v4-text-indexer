How ignorance pleades nonage, in his eie He knowes me not, tis not the Lyons kinde, Whose nature challenges right property, Of perfect being, if it were, Humil would Humill know, that him begot, To be what now he is married againe, And her first husband liuing, blame her not, Tis my owne proiect, thanke my letters, That falsifide our deaths black funerall, Into her mornefull hearing, follow it, Thinke on thy soule, diuide that bitter band, Knit by the closure of a mutuall hand. exit.

Married? tis ended, and the next pull mine. At a faire fleece, a golden one, the eldest daughter is my hope, what then rests in it, O you winged lap-wings, farthest cry, when we come neerest to't. Quando pecus omnia sub umbra ruminat antiquos paulilum vocitamus amores. exit. Iames. 'Tis done too late to aske why so. Tardie intrusion as a Cipher plaste. Fils but vp roome, while substance in the other Makes number pretious, I am that round O, Which with a sigh, as sad as is my soule, Grieue all too late, what now befits my mone, But black despaire, and die in't do, To make thy selfe knowne, but represents Mellow fruit falling into danger, Ã´ I am that Rotten ruin'd, and vnrellisht substance, Which on my owne vpgrowing tree falles off, By the times negligence, vndone I am, Would I had dide indeede, and not in word. These il tun'd words like discords sounded harsh And yet were thought true musick, well, well, Ile take my stand, and as she passes by Note if her glories dash not all my hopes With base forgetfulnesse of what she was, My picture can she not forget, may be, Old loue may yet liue in this new-born Lady. Enter the solemne order of the Bride-groomes returne from Church, and as the bride goes by, she beholds Iames the cittizen with earnest eye, &amp; speakes aside. Lady. I am woonder strocken in my selfe, O you all-seeing, pardon my attempt, My second choice hath laid siege to my soule, And my disloyalty hath in that witnesse Slaine the concurrances of after ioy, Euen so he look't that had my maiden heart, Euen such was he, whose farre estranged death Gaue me this licence of ill libertie, To do, and vndo, O forgiue me then, Weake in my sect, my fault to the best of men. S. Wil. New wedded Lady, &amp; our mornings bride, What is't that troubles ye? Lets fal her gloue, Iames takes it up. Lady, A losse but being small. Earle. No matter for the losse. You find a purchase, equals any crosse. Lady. Let it go then. Exeunt. Iam. she knowes me and this constant accident Subscribes to't, how can she excuse, This double deede, this false neglect of loue? O women how you dally in your trust, How quickly you forget late liuing life, And bury the remembrance in your smiles All ye this morning for the dead to sigh, And shed your teares in bosome of new choice How haue I sifted your loose difference, For euer being president against all. Glad am I at this oportunity, Who landed me euen in the iawes of feare Swallowing my destiue happinesse To vtter ruine of herselfe and me If the vnconstant aire whistle abroad, That Humil liues, then Humils widow dies In desperat scandall, rackt and tormented, In the remembrance of old wretchednesse, Which to preuent, plots cunningly contriu'd Must buckler my repute so weakly wiu'd. exit Enter sir Robert Toures, and yong Filbon. Tour. Lost her gloue? So she makes knowne. Tour. Ile find it to my euerliuing glory, And the next triumph, weare it in my helme Daring all gallants in defence to approue, S. William Vergirs Lady owes this gloue. exit Filb. If my good fortune challenge such account, To find it by my friend or industry, Ile prick it on a pole, and with my launce, Curuet with nimble speed, in course of armes, And as I snatch it by a curious passe, Cry in lowd eccho, here is for her loue, Who on her wedding day did loose this gloue. exit. Enter the two maiden sisters, Mary and Tabitha. Mary. The Bride, our new made mother lost her gloue. Tabith. I sister, so she saies. Mary. Ile seeke no further, for it is in vaine. Tabitha. Especially when quicker eyes then ours, Arch in the browes of loues two votaries, Lord how they'le bragge to find it questionles, Twill proue a ransome of a thousand kisses, Amorous glaunces, modest curtesie, O how these flaterers can insinuate, And stretch an inch of length to an el of wide Heeres much in office for a little pay. A gloue God wot. Mar. I sister, so they say, go to ye wanton you He that shall marry thee, is matcht y'faith, To English rash, or to a Dutch snap-haunce, You will strike fire with wordsâ Tab. Who I? now as I liue sweet Moll. If Filbon marry me, as by this light. Mary. And wincke. Tabith. Tis hard to iuggle with the diuell, we maides So simper in each others quantity As we know fashion ere it be deuiz'd Forsweare you one, and Ile forsweareâ Mary. The other, iust euen so, Shall I be plaine with theeâ Tabit. Youle answere, no Mary. I. Tab. No I. Mary. I no. Tabith. I know you will not, therefore let him go, I loue my Filbon as men loue good clothes, Put them on euery day. Mary. And I loue Toures as I loue my sleepe, Embracing thus, folding most deerely. Tabith. Your louer nightly, as you wish him yearely. Mary. In troth in such a sort: Tabith, As children play with stones, to make them sport. Mary. You make me blush Tabitha. Tabith. At the thing ye wish, Plague on the cat that loues nor milke nor fish. We are all maidens pictures, faine we would, Yet we cry away away, wh? away we should. Mary. Yet againe. Tabit. Neuer yet. Euer so when so our matters fit. Mary. They are returnd, a gloue or no. Enter Toures and Filbon. Tour. No, but the gloue I sought not, I ha found. Mary. Where is't man? Tou. You'r the gloue, which stil I seeke to weare Make me happy, match it to a paire. Mary. Be these for euer matches. Tab. How can ye find the gloue was neuer lost? Filb. By seeking you that lost not what we find. Tab. Indeed a willing losse, is losse of gaine, Where louing finders pitty loosers paine, I will not say, enioy so much the rather, Because gift giuer cries out on the father. But if I durst, I would, till when. Vnmatch our gloues, each take his owne againe. Enter Sir William, Iames, Earle of Tumult, Auditor, sir Rafe. S. Wil. It is inacted by the brides faire word, VVho findes her gloue, is this daies gouernour. To manage all our pastimes in the house, And thou art he, the onely conquerour, Of prize and honour, then enioy it. Iam. You giue and I receiue, is this my office? S. Will. Sign'd and deliuer'd. Iam. I take it on me, musicke triumphes come, Since fortune cast her fauours in my fist, Ile be most prodigall. Yet with modesty I am a Citizen. Vnlook't for welcome, and vnthinking come, To receaue honour in a states mans roome. Yet to this presence I will still addresse, Loue, paines and duetie in this businesse. Exit. Earle. In this is fortune blind, whose deeds are dangers, Giuing her graces not to friends but strangers. Toures. Prooue on my fortunes how so ere they stand, I hold my fairest fortune in my hand. Marie. The like doe I. Enter yong Humil. Filbon. And all the fairest fortunes I would proue, Is onely this, to enioy my dearest loue. Tabi. The like I wish. speake aside. Humyl. All happinesse liue in thy choice, in hers All mischiefs, horrour, les our selfe participate in tender of our choice, freely deliuer'd in the sight of heauen. S. Wil. What newes? Humyl. The wedding dinner breaths his last. S. Wil. And wee will visite it; on forward there. Exeunt. Enter Iames and Ladie. Iames. So faire and fortunate to be thus false, Wedded to two. O you all wondring eies, Gaze till your fire flame, your eie-balles drop In moist imagination of this act, Before the first be dead to wed a second Ã´ Lady. Why writ you dead in your last letters? Sick was I, and no likelihood of life. Iames. What then, was that a iust excuse To varnish ouer this base counterfeiting? no, Il'e make it knowne. Lady. I care not, I will thus excuse it, All opposite of iniurie was yours, Putting to teast our weakenesse by your letters, VVhich carrying credit, woman in her will, Guiltlesse is causer of this open ill. Iames. Had I beene thus aduiz'd, but all too late Acquainted with your speede, I had preuented what now is past and done, Lady. Why did you not? Baud to your owne misdeede, Three quarters guiltie of this accident, That might &amp; would not stop the hazard, VVill ye now heape vp miracle, And make it worse in note, by adding too't A bauins blaze, t'is not so soone extinct, Being fierce of flame, quensht must it be, By water-course of sounder pollicie. Iames. I am from my selfe in this, what shall I doe? O I am madde, and mischiefe mennassis vnwitting of all purpose. Ladie. Why did I cast my gloue, Proclaim'd the finder stickler of our sports, But to a point preuailing practise? Iames. I know not how. Lady. Leaue all to me, women that wade in sinne, Haue their wits-charter to authorize it, And they haue antidotes that to digest, Which better iudgements lose themselues in, let me alone. Iames. To ly with him the while. Ladie. Tis true to ly with him, but not in sheetes, To vse the flourish of a womans skill, In windes and turnings, other lying, My new-made husband iniures not the old, As I am simply false, I will be found Constant to death, knowing my businesse Is to heale vp the fractures of the time, And to salue vertue in her taint of ill. Iames. I build on this. Lady. Some moneth. VVhile I, possesse the glory of my name, Attendances according, marrie our sonne Vnto his eldest daughter, that's the point Of all: regaine my ioynter next, T'is not amisse to satisfie your debts, These two atchieu'd, the third as bedding, And if this braine beguile him not of that, Say I am single: no, since blame sits nie, Behooues giue care to vse true policie. Iames. Our sonne. Exit. Lady. Aside. Enter Humil. Humil. Mother the noble guest expects ye, The present meeting doos neglect it selfe VVhere our faire bride is wanting, Pray come in, you doe them wrong. Lady.

Will you be mindfull of our marriage, mother? Begin so happily in yours. Lady. I shall indeauour in it, come. Exeunt. Enter Marie, Tabithe, Toures and Filbon. Tabithe. Close and husht, not a fly stirring, VVhile they feede hungerly, we, that loues detie Doos proclaime pardon to presume, and speake, Challendge libertie, now by my maiden-head. Filbon. Sweare not loue. Tabithe. Can you forbid my oath? Sir I will sweare, &amp; till I lacke it, say, nought shall confine me, I had rather feast in fancies pittance, then to feede gag'd with attention, soothing euery bit with curiositie: no, I can fill my bellie in a minute, satisfie my stomacke in a breath: Louers digest their sighes, and chow their spleene, while other appetites fall hungry toot, and let them greedily graze on. Marie. VVhat's all this? Toures. Louers talke any thing. Filbon. I vnderstand ye not. Tabithe. I would not that you should, for I speake Greeke. Marie. Regard her not, for she talkes, Id'ly Filbon. Tabi. Be you aduiz'd then sister, I'me a foole. Yet not so simple but I talke by rule, I say, dine they that list, I will not, for my dish Drest to my hand is here, here let me feede, Ti's the maids modicum, God send vs speede. Marie. In that I claime a part, Who euer feedes this dish hath Maries hart. Tabi. So then said I well, ye wicked thing. Toures. Mot as I am of Louers vnion, Contracted to a sollitarie life, By thus retayning singlenes of heart: Changing all doubts that the world affords But one, so to thy sweetest selfe, Which onely art idea of my thoughts: I vowe a reconciled amitie, Which violated, doos command my life To yeeld his intrest to the shade of death, May be, your father alienates our choice, And showes as sunne-shine threatning raine, To the all-hoping haruest present, VVhich to make cleare, the honourable word And fatherly regard in present office Haue past their speede in our attention. I know your father will receiue their on-set Soldier-like, ioying the siege begunne, VVhich tho resisted, bids them gladly come. Marie. Pause in that trust, giue eare. Enter Iames with the musitions. Iames. Sound proclamation, It is inacted by the bride and bride-groome, And by our selfe chiefe in authoritie, That all receiue their pleasures From the most high in this assembly To the lowest, all pastimes are made free, Dauncing, carding, dicing reuelling. And other dues of times fit merriments, âVnto the bride and bride-groomes health. Tabit. The daies short, and the night's Filb. Stop there. Tabit. I will, to pleasure thee, Iames.

Enter all the traine to daunce. S. Wil. Squire of the day, cul out your gadding bucks.

Humil snatches Mary from Toures and dances. S. Wil. My sonne in law growes bold. Good againe, heres much to do in loue, One simply stands, not challenging his owne: And reason, Mary, chance is yet vnknowne No, nor in you sir, though my son, Words past contriue, but after deedes cry done. Audit. Brook'st thou this disgrace. Tour. O sir, no remedy, what Iustice liues so free. And to her owne is friending, Audit. I am mad to thinke on't boy, butâ They daunce a measure. Tour. How Goddes-like the elder of the two, Stations the measure, it is a Iouiall sight, Where beauty gilds the pauement with her light. How sullen Saturne tooke her by the hand. With frosty feeling, in whose icy touch, She shrunke her hold, but with a iealous eie, She glanst on me, fearefull that standers by Should be inricht with't: now she smiles me faire, Guilding my torture with an after hope. Thus moroliz'd, I season on my right, Her loue thus challeng'd by inferior might. This Daunce ends. S. Wil. After this dalliance here comes other sport. Pray ye attend him gallants: How now Iohn? Tardi venientis Iohn, you must be whip't. QuÃ¦so preceptor, non est tibi quid. Enter Iohn, Nurse, Boy, all in blew coates. S. Wil.

Ladie. Youle let me haue my ioynter yet. S. Will. Yes that, three hundred by the yeare ti's thine, But for your sonnes to wed my eldest daughter. Lady. VVhy, he doth merit her in my accord, and tis no wrong in you, to dip her blood in the selfe dye that wee are in. Sir. Wil. I grant his merit, but her shining value made golden glittering, by my vantings lookes to a higher promintoria, from which fower, when your sonne gazes, it affrights him, yeelds him plannet stroke. Lady. He shall not haue her then. Sir Wil. Beleeue it wife. Lady. He shall. S. Wil. Ha. Lady. I will not bed with you till then. Sir Wil. What? Lady. I ha said it, and when posture of our word takes his bace beeing, I will die the death, into our wedding sheetes shall mischiefe come, before my bodie breake your word with me, euen on your wedding day. Sir Wil. Nay then vp with the lists, againe it shall not be. Lady. I care not, thinke you I doe, keepe your word in that, when I breake mine. S. Wil. No more, be stranger to my bed, doe doe. Haue I of nothing made thee much and wilt thouâ Lady. Yes I will, haue you of protestations, othes, and vowes made these loose fractures: lawfull bee it then for me to shun the make-peace bed, since strife sets such diuision betwixt man and wife, I am most firme in't.

S. Rafe. But twill not serue, The big auouchments of my promises Controlles you all, and all mens else, ye all, Vnder degrees of Earles, Lords, or as Potent To toule them on I eccho these large sommes. S. Rafe. Vnualued must your sommes be to such choice, Honour lookes high aboue such pettie price. S. Wil. Looke honour high as heauen, Our earthly reach doth leauell in that eie, And with the imbellishment of richer worth Ile by, and out-by the imprisond scope, Of reaching blood, what will not value doe Where strong abillitie dos reach his hand, And they haue beautie too, which ioynd to riches Will proffer faire: tho not so quaint As courtly dames or earths bright treading starres, They are maids of More-clacke, homely milke-bole things, Such as I loue and faine would marry well. S. Rafe. It was a promise in you to be kinde. Sir William. Ile forward with that promise, you loue my eldest.â Toures. With my soule. S. Wil. And pittie to deuide that loue, then hearken me, when shees dead and liues againe, shees yours, not till then. Toures. Then neuer but in death. S. Wil. You loue my yongest daughter. Filbon. And will euer. S. Wil. Pray ye doe: but when you are from your selfe a woman, she is yours in marriage. Filbon. Woman to woman ioynd twere wonderfull, but in more maze of wonder I should be, what I doe challenge to participate, and from my selfe liue to deuide in other. S. Wil. Faith not till such a wonder. S. Rafe. Ist not enough to scandall thy true word? But are we slighted thus with fantasies, Impossibilities, dead and aliue againe, Manhood infuzd in woman: tis not generous. Exit. Audi. Come sonne vpon my blessing Take from thy eies thy heart adoring shine, Offer no more thy altar bearing thoughts To one so gyant-like, whose reach sits hie, Aboue the compasse of a gentill eie. Exit. Sir Wil. you haue your answeres, gallants. Toures. We like it not. Fil. Nor will we so except it. S. Wil. Fore-warnd come neare my house, Rapes, fellonies, and what may else be thought on, I will with heauie impositions Surcharge ye with, if not with pistoll shot, I will defend my selfe and these I keepe.

Humil. Tis the diuels office and not mine, to hell obedience, if he breake his word. Iames. You had a father loued ye better. Humil. He loud me as a king in a play, his seruant who were seeing him giues kind applause, but small vtilitie: my father in my child-hoode loud and left me to the worlds eie, in bold necessitie, I thanke him for it, since he di'de my mother hath her chance, mine wants the proofe, stand by times minion and inconstancie, oh. Iames. Haue patience. Hum.

Tutch. Like wax, sheele take any impression, sir she. Filbon. Like a tincke say ye? S. Rafe. Certainly euen so. Filbon. Twas my owne proiect father, hee applauded it, knowing my fashion of that counterfeit, to be so sure, as no man could forgoe me. Tutch. But himselfe sir, tis a point of law, arraigne him vpon Ipse facto. Filb. And art thou slept beyond me? where to night thou slepst: soft be thy pillow: easie be thy rest, &amp; may thy bed be. Song. Tutch. Mortall downe, thistle soft, She laid her selfe vnder to keep him aloft, And euer she said, come turne thee to me, And was not this bonny lasse Mary Ambre? Enter Auditor, and doth whisper with Sir Rafe. Filb. Mary indeede she hath resign'd to me hard choyce, Neare am I but as arrowes a farre of, Seemes to the shooter neighbor to the marke, Till it proue otherwise, so I Furthest from fauour am, though seeming nie. Tutch. Change your marke, shoot at a white, will say, come sticke me in the clout sir, her white is black, tis crept into her eye, and wenches with black eyes the white's turnd vp are but as custards, though they seeme stone cold, yet greedily attempted, burning hot, and such a wench is she sir. Filb. I know she loues me. Tutch. Most affectionately burnes in desire for ye, but key cold through her father, she stands to freeze while others are appointed to thaw the Ice, not you. Filb. I must vse pollicie. Tutch. The onely man, I will assist you sir, Filb. I thanke thee, and I will preuaile in't. Audit. I thinke sir, if I see my house to night, there will come warrants to make open way to their recouery, thinking they are with me, whom I protest I haue, not seene, and vnacquainted with her subtill stealth, am now as cleare as is the babe new borne, I neither knew of it, nor where they are, I do beshrow their hearts, right I haue in him for it. S. Rafe. sleepe in my house then, so my word sha'l make your answere stronger, I haue a sonne, I wish him so possest, but not with violence, yet say he doe climbe high, and reatch the top bough with a stricter course, I knowing not the manner nor the meanes, acquites me, and God giue, them ioy, my oath is cleere, and that's my warrant. Audit. Sir, I will trouble you to nigh, by this sad time his mone doth challenge comfort, and the councell whose loues he hath so often visited, heartned on by the Earle of Tumults meanes, they will adde present purpose as he begges it. S. Rafe. but if the Earle know of my sons discharge, sign'd by his carelesse answere, t'would allay his hot endeuours with a cold responsall; but cease that, the time shall comeâ Filb. Tis mine, the cause and all, pine let mee in them, if the sonne of hope shine as a troubled meatuare in the sky; tis our fates fortune, and no matter cause no remedy. Aud. True vantings of resolue, tis late, and custome challenges no right in me, to be so hurtfull to my selfe, the euenings aire is rawe and cold. S. Raf. Filbon follow vs, be you more temperate. You see what hurry threatnings this misdeede Wounds deepe are dangerous, though they hardly bleed Filb. Sir, I am lessond, Tutch. As the boyes at schoole? Practise their knowledge by contrary rule. Exeunt. Enter Humil sadly. Hum. O I am slaine wi th wonder. Hath this life left in it a little breath, To blow out treason, reeke yee cloudes of shame, Putrifie all imagination, hold her at stearne, There let her sinke, neuer to win againe, Homers recouery, shall I say and thinke it? Oâ Haue I not beene in bed to night, and so Talke idly wanting sleepe, or rose from rest, As many troubled doe, acting like life, Awaking dead, for in that flattering feare, Perchaunce her reputation may be saued. No I am certaine in my feare, tis true, In yond black closset lies a wicked woman, (I will not say my mother, that names lost) In the twind brazings of the slaue her man. In Iames his armes, and shall I suffer it? Oâ To blab, it were to harould out my shame, In quarter'd scutchin of black obloquie, To murder one were most imparciall; Againe to turne hilles on this sinne, Would write me baude, but to be nobly satisfide Is a content licenc'd from equity. The knight shall know it, I will write to him, Startle his bold imagination with pale feare, Rose his reuengefull spirit on them both, And make me hopefull of his loue neglected, Forgiue me world, heauens iustice puts me on, And though a sonne, Ile punish both or none. Exit. Enter Earle, and Lord, and Sir VVilliam, the Lords, and sir VVilliams two men bearing torches. Earle. You that binde vp in secrets of the night, Dayes benefites going to rest; As peacefull birds, lodg'd in a sanctuary. Smile at our Courtiers care, whose industry, Rules in the silent and all shadowing night, Suites that are breathles in a troubled day. Haue their abiding in our cares at night. Hard censur'd, and atton'd by late aduice, Saluing the worlds scares, as we would your care Knew we the burthen of it. Lo. With vs the morn is mated with the moone And we are retrograde to what you doe. Esteeming conscience, benefite and good. Challeng'd in seruice of our country: Sir though our blood affirme vs labour free, It bindes thee more to busie industry, Wonder not at our late vpsitting therefore. S. Vil. Your humors toile in our extremities, But we vnthankfull merit contrary, Thinke it a want and weaknesse in our kind, I poste and labour in a toile my selfe, Seeking my owne: midnight to me is noone, And all the houres of dull past night, Sun-shine eclipses, that do much molest me, Pardon me that am so tedious. Earle. Seeking your owne. S. Wil. My eldest daughter is conuei'd from me, Hurri'd away, as theeues by violence Conuey their booties from the true mans store. Auditor, Toures sonne hath done this deede, A rescue noble Lords. Ear. Rescue and right, challeng the benefite. S. Wil. A warrant for a generall search, Restraints for Cinck-ports, and all passages, That theeuish water doth dispoile vs of. Ear. It shall be sign'd i'th morning, Draw the contents as you affect the meanes, And let attendance vrge the early act. Lord. Good night. Ear. God morrow is it not? S. Wil. Betwixt them both. The morall of my misery seeking too late, That to recouer which I lost too soone. Lord. And yet in each you stand indifferent. S. Wil. I must, till perfected by you, Either late losse, or timely victory, Recouering what I feare is past aduantage. Ear. Hope the best sir, things at worst, Season in their decay, as children mend, Bent in their eye to ruine, yet they pause Resting in grace, does reobtaine at will, Opinion in rash iudgement, dooming ill. Lord. Good rest, for we go too't. S. VVil. The peace of happinesse be with ye, I will retire me to my Inne, and wish, Howres as short as momentary breath, For till the morning, minutes howres be, And howres yeares, such is reuengd to me, Might I enioy it? Man. Sir. Sir Wil. My man, a midnight messenger, what is thy haste in leathe steept, speake is that all one? one all, that we call daughter, gone too, is she? Man. No Sir. S. Wil. Wherefore starest thou so wildly, say, weart thou asleepe and wakened? com'st to vs here without thy better part? and sent abroad, leauing thy wits at home. Man. Your sonne sir, in all haste sends you his talles, wishes your wit and iudgement sodainely, read and regard sir. S. Wil. Giue the torch, if you wil see my mother &amp; your wife, fellow'd in bed make haste, Iames your man writes on your pillow &amp;c. my eies are witnesses to their adulterie. Seruant. Whats the newes? Man. Plague on these iauntings, once we shall be old, &amp; then this trotting life will linger in our bones, all howres are our nights, we dally with our owne destruction. S. Wil. It cannot be, or if, or if, what if? if it be so I am vndone, poison'd am I with faire promises, no maruell tho you doe forsweare my bed, if yet againe, if what make I here wh? treason is at home, away. Enter yong Humil. Humil. The bird that greets the dawning of the daie, Signes with his wings, the midnights parture, And the sleetie deaw moistning the cheekes Of morrowes welcome: giues earnest of the morne: Yet all secure, adultrate lust dos sleepe, And I the hatcht yong of this troden henne, Stands Centinell to her idolatrie. Blow you sweld windes and crack the battlements, Rouse their incestious luxurie with feare Of whats to come, yet that were my mishap, No silentaire fan on them bawdie breath. That as they reeke in their licentious loue, Diuell may seale sure, and Morpheus so pleas'd, May to their pastime adde affliction Deliuer'd by the hand of him thats wrongd, And stands indebted to his desteny: Yet are they as the hower, whose sandy minutes Runs out at pleasure till the period comes, Fast sleeping, and enioy their quiet, Rouse the blacke mischiefe from thy ebben cell, Land in the bosomes of this twin in lust, Him whose heapt-wrong calles vengeance to be iust. S. Wil. Locke fast that dore and leaue me. Giue me your light, Sonne Humil? Humil. Father. Enter sir William and his men. S. Wil. Thou seest I am obedient at thy call. Exit seruants. I come as messengers that bring their bale, Sign'd in their lookes, be well aduis'd, Thou makest a chalenge goes beyond all grace, Should it be false. Humil. It is my loue to you that makes me step Heart-deepe in disobedience to my mother. Wretch that I am to thinke her so, It makes me desperat of prioritie, Forethinking my beginning to be bace, Conceau'd in such mistrust and frailty, My front hath that impression still, Adding a blush to my distemperature, And I am crest-falne in sanguinitie, Pray ye beleeue me, would it were not so. S. Wil. Enough watch &amp; be secret, I will enter, Sit as the night rauen or the skreeking owle, Ouer my portall, menasing ill chance To all within: for death is to my blood A blessing, while this feuor killes, Almost my intellect or better part, Yet shees thy mother, and no sonne but hates His owne disgrace so highly merrited, And I beleeue thee. Hu. Sir, trueth is trueth, my conscience and religion Bindes vp in me, and since I doe proclaime Detraction from my blood, by her misdeede, Giue me leaue to report a flye a flye, If it offend the vertue of mine eie. S. Wil. Tis true. And yet me thinkes it should not be, How hardlie will this scandall take impression, Where resolu'd christianity dos dwell? But I will trie the gold, perhaps tis base, Who knowes the hearts affection by the face. Exit. Humil. Scarlet is scarlet, and her sin blood red, Wil not be washt hence with a sea of water, Is this my hand, or is the fire fire? whose scorching heate dissolues rel?ting mettall, When as it tries the substance; yes, and I Make knowne my mother is an alien, From my blood, so to fall off, and perish Euen in her pride of blisse, damn'd be the slaue That so attempts her spotlesse chastitie To ruine, I know that yet smooth looke, Plotted, contriu'd, and woon her with deuise, She neuer knew a double character till now, But single singler she euer rulde, Euen modesty her selfe, Vesta resignd to her, And vertue hand in hand at barly-breake, Ran the swift course, none but a hound of hell, Hunted this fawne of fortune to his kennell, But my mother, forgetting her degree, Dos captiuate loue, life and liberty, By one deedes practise, wicked, nay farre worse, Fatall disgrace, honours created course. S. Wil. Foole, foole, foole. Enter S. Wil. Humil. Ha. S. Wil. Light bubble swell and breake, would'st thou beleeue all this, and giue a glosse to slaunders crueltie: ripening reproch it selfe with thy fond eare, o Humil, Humil. Humil. Sir. S. Wil. Thou art a villaine, and hast cast vp hilles against heauen it selfe: when sonnes vnto their mothers are so false, O where is grace? hud winckt from honour, sham'd to shew her face. Humil. Is it not so? S. Wil. Trust thy owne eies, go, thou shalt see a sight Will melt thy stubborne spleene in pittie, Sweetely she sleepes, whose innocent respect Smiles in her dreames, the childlike gouerne, Laughing lowd in their simplicitie, While waking, mischiefe seekes that to vndoe, Which true requir'd, stands centinell vnto, Goe and returne with shame. Humil. With shame, diuell of mischance whats this? Did I not see their cutted guilt looke big? Was I in traunce of my beleefe, ha, was I? Can be no iugling in it: can there? Exit. S. Wil. No thou art constant as the northren starre, And I as giddy as the vntam'd Leopard, That sees no meanes but dire destruction, Flinging his foame to poison in his waie Mans mischiefe, plotted to his ouerthrow: He to'd me true, o that I liue to thinke so, Or they so wretched to deserue the thought, Soundly they slept, whose sl?bers kisd me waking, Yet to recouer halfe slaine reputation, Done haue I, what to purpose practiseth If it preuaile, our honour so reseru'd Will kicke at all malignant crueltie That taints our name with euer liuing skorne, Fortune be for me, I will that recouer, Which diuell him selfe cries guilty too, my fame The flight it wings, imps feathers of renowne, That left al's lost, my birth-right tumbles downe, Enter Humil amazed. Humil. Sir I am sorry. S. Wil. How can they excuse such wanton loosenesse? know they I stand here to thunder vengeance on their luxury. Humil. My mother's fast asleepe, and I awake, am in a transiue maze, vnwitting how to make my peace with God her selfe and you. S. VVil. why are they not together? Humil. Not in bed. S. VVil. Thou should'st with Argos hundred eyes, Search in the chinkes and corners round about, It cannot be but she is extant there, ha, is she not? Hum. I am confounded in the search, please your iustice be my torture, I haue murdered innocence, sorrow is not the way, death is the least, I challenge cruelty and vrge the exactest point of perill, slaue that I am to liue. S. Wil. A sonne, a sonne, to do so to a mother. Humil. Fare ye well, rather then be a witnes of my wrong, I will not see my selfe in't, go thou worse then, Ile sacrifice to the diuill, that tempted thee, all thy Distempered thoughts, cry mercy to her sectes. To spotlesse innocence be free, say all thy treasons, Build on slippery ice, and thou art frozen cruelty, Sir, for your wrongs, if you remit black torture, tis My hell, and I appeale to sterne rigor, O you sonnes, Whose true obedience shines in maiesty. While mine more vgly then is vulcans tithye. Smels ranker then despised Hemlocke Curse and ban him, I am your subiect to't And euery mother, whose snow innocence, Feeles soft and tender, as the downe on palme, Rate my rebellion with a blisseles name, And for my sake giue misaduenture aime. Guide 'hem to me, say I am such sonne, Through whom a mother is fo soone vndoone, S Wil. Let me not see the while thou liu'st away, Let thy repentance shew it selfe in this, Not to be seene where thou hast done amisse. Catiue depart. Hum. I will, this tongue that slandered, S Wil. Be her slaunder still. Hum. It is too much already, was I bewitcht, That thus at hud-man blind I dallied With her I honor'd? Ã´ you times how haue you Nurst me, but no more, Humil hath branded on his Mothers name, an Ãthyops blacknesse, and A spotted staine, forgiue me that and all. Exit. S Wil. What need I to afflict reuenge on him That on himselfe exasperates, farewell thou pride Of sonnes, who to a father in supposition onely and by law, art all so louing, that thy mother dalling With w?tones as girles with gauds, thou not respectes The womb that brought thee forth, but ill attempting So, and so thou rumorst, as the fault ripe in act, Is blowne to aire, and though her sonne thou Vtter'st what they were, thou shalt not loose by't Now it fits, I challenge from the offence some right, And adde confine to this adultery Wife, wife, rise and come forth. Enter Lady, in her night gowne, and night attire. Lady. Call ye sir? S Wil. Yes, take my closset key, let forth your louer, Giue me some ease by way of reason yet, and t'will Allay our discontent, O God so new to marriage, and So stale, couldst thou so soone reuolt, so soone, ha? Enter Iames vnready, in his night-cap, garterles with the Lady. Iames. I must acknowledg all. Lady. O No, some better looze, This will but adde to mischiefe torture Vse patience now be reconcil'd to feare, Be doue-like humble, and leaue that to me. Iame. How can I, when the brand is on my brow, But by exclaime, giue ease to torture, My braine is scar'd, and I am liueles in't? S Wil. Kneele not. Ambo. A sentence, let vs dy. S Wil. No maruel though you vow this abstinence When deputed by him, you shunne my bed, You do deserue your iointer well, To admit a fellow in a true mans place, I thanke ye for it, yes. Lady. Sir. S Wil. No, no words I know you can alleadge, The diuell has scripture for his damned ill, And this dos neighbor it, go and attire ye. Be smilefull, and expresse no griefe in sithes, Rather be tickling sportfull, topt in pleasure. Then daunted any way, that me concernes. To vse the mad-mans guise, but I am past it, Since what is done no reference hath to wish, I am for credit sake, supportable, al's well, Content am I to be senseable, and feele my Fortunes as I may, ranking my selfe with such, As sometime liu'd in my repute most base, Faith all is well beleeue it, I am satisfied: I know you do repent, and that's my-remedy, Other amends, I looke not for, In, and attire ye, But stay you with me. Lady. I am obedient. Exit Lady. S Wil. Go thou shame, neuer till now possest, And in a breath confounded, sir, you see your wrongs Shine through the horne, as candles in the eue, To light out others, thinke you this misdeede, Merits saluation? Iames. I must acknowledge contrary. S. VVil. Wilt thou for all this spight, yet vse me kindly in the next? Iames. Command me sir. S. Not for the second, this mistake me not, Rather to binde thee from it, if hereafter, Fashion of frailty summon vs to feare I must be plaine, and therfore thus: Looke when so euer I hold vp this finger, Signing my lippes with it, and cry begone, Euen then be speedy to depart the land. If not all power of mischiefe that I can, I will and so resolue. Iames. Sir, I am ready to the minute. S. VVi. It may be, other reasons will restraine me As causelesse motiues, nor seeing guiltinesse. In needy sequences perhaps our heart will in it selfe take truce with this mischance, or if it doe not, yet attend our spleene, it wil be better for ye. Iames. In humble duty. S. VVil. Goe, giue coppies of good countenance to our friends, thinke all is well, for so it is, I that am all in griefe, am all in suffering, I forgiue the reason, Fate ye well. Exit. What I will do, is bar'd vp in this closet, The key that opens it, is my reuenge Turn'd by a hand whose palme dos itch with fire Til al consume, a cuckold, cuckold William fir is Its euen so, would I were yet the last or least, But not by thousands go too then, am I all alone, in this Who is't that tongue calles man That is assured of his wiues conditions None, or if any, there the PhÅnix hues Vnfellow'd, be his fate renown'd while mine Is mockery, and a Testiue stock, to all that knowes me. O you starres blaze fire, till this abuse be quenchd By my desire. Exit. Enter Tutch like a welch knight, and Filbon as a seruant waiting. Tutch. Harke ye Morris. Filbon. I Sir. Tutch. Where is Tailer? dudge me, will knog his pad, What is chirken with cold button done, say you. Filbon. Excellent, this is welch indeede, O my honest Tutch. Sause box, rowly powly, am I not your master? Filbon. You are sir, pray ye pardon me. Tutch. You must haue your left eie Diamiter wise, Fixt on my right heele, and all the offices, A seruant owes in dutie to his Master, performe As naturally as if the fortie shilling time Were come, left I leaue talking welch, and crack your pate in English. Filbon. I shall obey sir. Enter M. Auditor in a Marchants habite, with Tabitha. Auditor. Fairest of beauties, loue her seemely selfe, For thy two eies are Cupids, which doe shoote From thy inamor'd bow, shafts all of gold, Headed with mettall of immortall proofe. In thy faire bosome liues two hearts relenting, Thine penetrable, through attoning pittie, Mine longing by desire to scale the fort Of loues faire presence, make me happie, Signe to my sute, but ye, for tis thy censure Makes me thus bold, pronounce faire iudgement, Either of life or death, I that plead loue, Doubly deuoted, challenge from thy dietie A maiden answere, let it come bright fire, To trie the substance of my loues resolue. Tabitha. Sir, in sooth and veritie beleeue me, That I am faire tis credible, but to shoote Arrowes, whose heads haue such immortal proofe, Tis most erroneous and false, sfoot your a puritane, A cittizen Ime sure, her canuas curran bags, Stuft with sweete sinnonion and cloues, Good sir you are deceau'd in me; Ime country plain Without this nicetie, and do you loue me, yes? Then craue an answere without ceremonie, Fetcht from proud Ouid in his Arte amandi, I doe not like it I. Tutch. Ples you Latie. Tabitha. Sir and you, tell me of Cupids eies, shot from inamord bowes with hearts relenting, doubly deuoted, and I know not what. Tutch. Ples you firgen. Tabitha.

Neglect me so. Tabitha. Wiues vnto Citizens are trades-mens daughters, I am a blood of gentle composition, My minde dos equall it, I must be coacht, Banckquered euery where, courted abroad, At home flattered, for my priuate vse, I must haue fancies, playfellowes, as apes, Monkies, baboones, mufs, fannes, receits, Costly abilliments of seuerall suites, Wil ye giue this? twil breake you sir, And crack your credits faire condition, no, Citizens would, but cannot answere so. Tutch. Harg you, marry with her, and God dudge me, all is yours, was a knight haue land, and a great deale of rishes, wil maintaine you well, say you. Tabitha.

Then whom you wil, call you this modestie to be so waspish? giuen to slight men off with inciuillitie, giue me leaue to remember. Tabitha. What you please, all the world except one or two, my eie motes that trouble but my sight. Filbon for me, man else but meere illusion and idolatry, vaine worship, images of molten mettall, which to drosse dissolud, appeare as nothing to my iudgement, but his worth beyond compare, gentle and suffring as the silent aire, that tho it brooke the buffets of base breath, yet in it selfe tis heauenly, free from earth. Tutch. Harg you, was knight in house cald Sir William Perger. Tabitha. Verger sir? Tutch.

S. Wil. Tis likely, sonnes in these doting daies Wil from their fathers alienate, differ stil From loues obedience, and in hearts affection, Ioyne hand to h?d, though beggery neighbor it, And let them go. Henry. Sir I am free then from your feare. S. Wil. I good sir Henry I was wrong inform'd, I am your patron in all loue. Henrie.

And vse me no worse being your man, then I vsed you, being mine. Filb. O better, better. Tutc. O loue, thou art a begger, yet I am thy debter. exeunt. Enter two sailers with a truncke, wherein is Mistresse Mary in her winding sheete, others with pick-axe and spades, as on the sands. Tour. Set downe the heauiest load That euer true affection vnderwent, To you tis like the Anchor of your ship, Heauy at first, but easly waied seemes light, To me, that not supports her bodies waight, Tis heart deep in the burthen, &amp; too p?derous Sad, heauy is that load, whose leaden poize, Is as a sullen sorrow, too, too pressing. Mr. Sir, I would wish you to be briefe. Tour. Dig ho this golden beach, whose glittering sands Shewes with the sunne as Dyamonds set in gold, Fitly intombs a iewell of much worth, Whose liuing beauty staind all lapidary. Mr. She was most gentle which was worth all riches. Tour. And this nights tempest did a cruell deede, To take from me a vallue of such price. Mr. Sir, though our seas kill women with their frownes vs their bug-beare threates are womanish, and so we leaue e'm Tour. Leauing your selfe and all, somtime, Mr. Euen so, no safer in our beds, Or on the land, but vnder deaths black stroke, And he that is the surest, sits in state, Dyingly tended by the hand of Fate. Tour. And yet me thinkes death should not Take her from me, being scarce mine owne. But newly wed, neuer bedded yet. So that the Ceremony burning bright, Himen yet hath his tapers flaming red. And the bold boastings of that good mans breath. That all religiously made one of two. Hardly disgested in the freezing cold, Little I thought the priests word being, euer, Should find his period in so short a time. Mr. Sir, but the gift was giuen ye on condition, Till death depart, better or worse, Me thinkes this Catechizing little needes, To humane guiding, and to you the lesse Knowing what openly you do confesse. Tou. Beare w'e me maister, he that pines in griefe, Liues as you sailors doe, thinking at sea, Euery storme ends, when flattery flouts ye, So to our loue-sick sorrow comes a calme, By ease of fancies, when tis furthest, And many times the weapon that doth wound, Is salue, and Surgeon both, to make all sound. Mr. Are ye ready sir? Tou. All fitted, let me take my last farewel, I am all gelly in my teares and sighes, Wasted by waiting her vntimely losse, So long I did consume in drops of woe, That contrary I laugh to thinke it so. He that weepes much, hauing no teares to spend, Smiles out the rest, but inwardly does rend, O God that I ventring so hard a chaunce, Should loose my dice, before my hand be out, Tis euen so, in all things man intends The losse is ours, the winnings not our friends. Mr. For charity be briefe, should the wind Turne his beake into the southerne side Our ship would leaue vs, dally not with griefe, Once and no more, let sorrow rule as chiefe. Tou. Then thus, and this the last, Moll, I take leaue yet on thy hersed selfe, Dead selfe, and selfe slaine Moll decest I am thy morning musike, call thee vp, To wedded rights, I leade thee to the Church, And there receiue thee, dine with thee at noone, Daunce all the after day, bring thee at night Into the wedding chamber, this is it. And here I leaue thee to thy virgen slumber, Neuer attempted, as thy birth bestowd, Madam beginning, take it in thy end, So liue thus die, onely my married friend, And nothing else, gone art thou to a power, Which will with welcomes take thee, left I am To the worlds crosse, thy father who inrag'd, Will bitterly reuenge thy death on me, But I will proue his martyr, se-thee Moll, Foole that I am to say so, here is all, Gownes, tire, all abilliments of thine, No rag shall rest remembrant in my viewe. To stirre the imbers of thy dying fire, I kisse thy key cold corse, and with this key, Lock thee for euer vp, farewell, farewell, My mouth the Church, my voice thy Parting knell. All eares that liue and heare This bell to toule, Christian-like bid peace vnto her soule. Mr. Amen, be speedy mates, see ye not, looke The blewnesse of yon cloud dos threaten winde, If it rise faire, we shall be lodgd in France, But not where please the fates. Dispatch. Within. A board, a board, heie. a crie within. Mr. Hollo, linger no time aboard, you heare With me ho, will the rest stay? how a yeare? O God that man should leaue behind, And liue, the loue of soule and minde. Exeunt, and leaue the pikax and spades behinde. Enter Gouernour and a Gentleman. Gouernor. Sir welcome to Scillie, Where I command my brothers friends haue welcome, But now my flattery gets you on this beach, Where you prospectiuely see many countries, Learn this of me, where d?ger shootes her string, We in our neighbour neerenesse ought to feare: But arm'd by our foresight, make bold resist Against the brags of forraigne enemies. Gentle. I haue not seene a better glasse to looke in, What country call you yon, whose cliffes are as the cloudes smoake, and all shadowing mists? Gouer. Sir that is France, a faire beseeming friend, On yonder continent stands Ireland, On this side Brittaine, and on that side Garsie, Ilands besides of much hostillitie, Which are as sun-shine, sometimes splendious, Anon disposed to altering frailtie. We that all neighbor must so str?gth our being, As fearelesse we may frolicke yet not seeing. Gentle. I vnderstand ye sir. Gouer. Now let my longing haue content in you, With the report of them you lately saw, My brother Vergir and his children, Is he a widower still at More-clacke? Gent. Married sir vnto a London cast a way, One whose decaied husband left to liue, (Though poorely) yet your brothers Lady. Gouer. It is his choice, and I subscribd to't, But for his daughters sir? Gen. Alas, in them is he vnhappy, One is haild from him by stolne practises, The other liues as though she were not his, A goodly gentle woman, but her owne in heart, She will be gone to, for her gouernement Stands vpon will, as men stand on the beach, Seeing the sea wherein they must be dround, Yet fearelesse venter on the ruthelesse maine, She will regardlesse of her father, marry, And dos as most, long for the miserie, Signd to them in their cradles. Gouer. Sorry am I. Ha, what scrambled ends heape vp confusedly? New digd and ript vp is this plot of ground, Some Shipwrack on my life, hid to deceiue The Queene and me of our aduantages. Gentle. Likely sir, And see our sodaine comming scar'd from hence, In the new ending, such as pil'de this heape, Behinde them haue they left their implements Which did the theft, what thinke ye sir if we Redig the ground, should we depart &amp; leaue it? At midnight wold they fetch their borrowings. Gouer. I like your purpose, ile make one. Gentle. What doe you thinke it is sir? Gouer. No bodie buried, it is sure some goods, wrackt on the sea, money or rich commoditie, Gentleman. Tabacco then. Gouernor. Tis likely, for with vs men smoke ther lands thorough their nostrels, shall I tell ye sir, tis a commoditie may well be spared. Gentle. Good lucke a gods name, sir it is a truncke. Gouer. Lift sir. They lift it out. Gentle. Tis quicke, it heau'd as I heau'd it. Gouer. Yfaith I thinke so to, in heart of hope I will be all so bold, as to breake way. Gentle. Ha. They breake the Truncke open, and she sits vp. Mary. If you be men and borne of that weake sex, Which I my selfe professe, being woman, Pittie the liuing sorrowe of a maide, Buried for dead, but backe againe recal'd, By the diuinitie of heauenly power, Amaze not, I am creature, flesh and blood, Not as I seeme, a pale and earthly Ghost, The story when you heare it shall make plaine, The wofull chance of life so lately slaine. Gouer. I had acquaintance with this voice, my cosin. Gentle. Tis she, sir, tis Mistris Mary Virger, I know her. Marie. My name recalles my memorie, And I am such a creature, oh, My vnckle, where am I? returne againe, Death thou art wanton in a louers paine. Gouer. Cosin I will not question the particulars, The time calles on a present comfort, And your life halfe spent, Makes true necessitie delay no longer, Therefore come, as leasure we shall heare, The dying story of your miserie.

My daughter and my goods, I haue no other sonne but you, all is thine, Question not the reason, why this is, For I haue many, and amongst them one Sites all the rest, that knowne to thee, Will rather hasten death, then pitty it.

I will haue more then all our friends, Musike seuerall, Masques and Reuellings. In which thou shalt be mounted as the bride, And I the iolly Bridegrome, will tend on thee, As duty and the time commands me. Lady. Where of comes this cost? S. VVil. Examine not, but lay your best end now to't Councell with this Pothecary which I sent for To the businesse, pray ye vse your art: For I am bent to this consumption, Wheres our seruant Iames? Lady.

Pray ye appoint sir, she will fit you well, My purse shall puruey what you shall determine, What we will be wastful sometime, &amp;c our owne, We vncontrol'd may dispose of: tis our loue, Rather our destinie, hate ioin'd to this brow, A horne that drawes on death, no matter how.

No, twas a subtill straine, so hudwink't truth, I am a traytor if I did not see Iames your man fast in your armes. Lady. Thou art a traytor then, if any Iames were there, hee was no man of mine, he was thy father. Lady. Maruell not, at leasure I will tell thee all, His late returne, the tricke to place him here, My stay, and his continuing in this house, which Knowne, thou wilt no sin account, to keep our owne. Hum.

If keepe secrets, can be but offence, and so tis now, May be, I loose my place, but theres a friend which Turning calles detraction, at his heeles liues hope, Whose cunning quicknes euery fault to fauour. Filb. Why true, and we shall as we may excuse it, Twas a deede done in welch, you vnderstood it not. Tabith. Let me alone to buckler thee sir Henry. Henry. Can ye ward your selfe? Tabith. This was a passe, twas Fencers play, and for the after venny, let me vse my skill. S. Rafe. How euer girle, thou art my daughter now, What thou shalt loose in father, from thy owne, Thou vncontrold shalt find as much in his, And I am he. Tabith.

I knowing more then much in this her absence, singled my selfe to warne you of his search, hether will hee come, for he feares yong Filbon, missing the suters, calling for the marchant, I answered not (being absent) in this heat: the welch man, where is he? none can be found, cries out he knowes not what, and all his word is now, a plott, a plott, a plott. S. Rafe. What will ye doe? Tabitha. Kisse and part, till fit occasion of our next salute, Filbon farewell, my husband thinke on me, I am thy treasure but thou bear'st the keie. Exit. S. Rafe.

Now smiles the instant, &amp; wrathes wrinckles seeme, As smoothed curles vpon a wanton streame, My hopes grow big, and their diliuery, Is by our midwife time brought to true birth, I will not be a pointing stocke tot'h world, No, if this gossip rumor publish it, It shall be christned with reuenge and death, Why when, are we growne sluggards now? Tardy in bountie, shall we niggard it? Enter Humil in white sleeues and apron, and others posting ouer the stage with boxes. Humil. Be quicke, carry those sweete meats in, Bid them that in this businesse haue to doe, That they attend this rich confectionary, With no common care, the cost c?mands more loue And duetie, sir we are fitting to occasion, Would all your guests were come. S. Wil. Tis the feasts duetie to attend, Thou art a willing mischiefe, hast thou fitted our purpose to the proofe? Hu. Haue I, thinke you I am flacke? Pusht on with hope of beautie and reward, She dies had she a life more deare Then the last spring, sole comfort of the yeare. But I will couer and prepare. Exit. S. Wil. Doe, doe, my daughters thine, my goods, my all, Blessed beginning to my sorrowes fall. Wheres my Lady? Lady. Here. Enter Lady gallant and braue, while Humil and others prepare. S. Wil. That one so heauenly faire should earthly be, Slaue to misfortune, bace in luxurie. Lady. Sir for to please your eie, I am thus quaint, Good faith I am asham'd in my selfe. S. Wil. How and a woman. Come blaze thy affections to immodesty, And tho thy vertues contradict the deede, Be Venus wanton, smile, with Helens eie, For I will haue it so. Lady. I was not so brought vp: I shall endeauor, tho my cheekes put on sensuable die of other bashfulnesse. Iames. Sir your honourable guests are come. S. Wil. Nay then you wrong me most of all, Shew not these signes of feare, all's past, And I am dead in old remembrance, Troth I am, forget it, as I doe, say on. Iames. Coches so fill the pauements of your dore, That scarce can passage giue the footemen way, Tis not amisse you goe to meete them sir. S. Wil. Why well said, spoke with courage, &amp; I will, Iouiall like a bridegroome, Lady you see, They waite on vs, and all attend on thee. Lady. Worthlesse I am, but since it is your will, I borrowe light from sun-shine of your beames, Who glisters so, giues splendor nothing proud, Dark'ned by feare, halfe hidden in a cloud. S. Wil. Nay hand in hand, in faith Iames pardon me, That dally with the darling of your heart. Exeunt. Iames. Euen so, but little thinking such a thing, Small gaine springs from that toile, where industry Sweats in the browes of others victorie. Enter Humil busily still. Hum. Father be mindfull, this presuming knight, Plaies with the flame, burnes in the candle-light, When we shall furnish to disfurnish him, Of what he yet enioies. Iames. Humil, tis cunningly contriu'd, and I attend it. Exit. Humil. For charitie be swift. Place your plate, and pile your vitriall boales Nest vpon nest, These for wines and beare, The other tend the call of altering diet, Sirrha, quoth he, we shall sit I trow, The pleasant purpose of loues appetite, Ad hand yfaith, and welcome to the feast, Whose foode is pleasure, dainties but a iest. And I prouide it for ye. Enter Earle, Lords, Ladies, so many as may be, S. Wil. and his Ladie in complement. S. Wil. Right noble &amp; my hearts indored friends, To preach your welcome, were to drowne the sea With floods of water. Be it knowne vnto ye, That your comming solemnely inuited, Hath that attendance appertaining as the Gods In their selected Bacchiuels command, Mary, the Nectar wants, and the Ambrotia, Smiles in the presence of such earthly wines, As the worlds compound furnishes with all, Though it come short of lushius surfetting: Yet willing furtherance makes the value meete, In her best suite of entertaine, sit then, And let our musicke relish to the eare: Such care and cost as loue and welcome giues, Not to prophane the best except the least, As prolong to begin this worthlesse feast. Earle. Sir we are easily won to fawn on frendship, Spanniel-like, yet with the smiles of men, Which redeliuers loue for loue, What we receiue are treasures safely stor'd, And shall with intreest be repaid againe, Your free, yet frugall, without lauishing, Nor come we to make boote of curtesie, But value kindenesse in her best of loue, So wee dwell in your bountie. S. Wil. Rent-free welcome. If you thinke this your receptacle, then Landlord I am, and shall so soundly proue, As fines forgiuen, you leese, free borne our loue. Welcome our tenants Landlady. Lady. I do, my duty tenders it, Sit then and frolicke, for to my hearts liking, Is this day consecrated, blest the meanes, That added to it, such prosperitie, While we sat-sighing on the bancks of bale, Blisse kist her cheeke, and bids her ioy, al haile. S. Wil. I such a storm as when the shower is past, It driues destruction to thy soule, Morral in faith, enigmaies riddles so, Musike fal too, wife I wil seate thee heere. With pardon of thy betters. Ear. In yours she is the best &amp; does command Place and periority i'th vpper hand, Besides, her beauty merits as the best, To ouer shine starres, were they here possest. Lady. VVell mock't my Lord. Earle. No, not a whit. My iudgement erres, if otherwise I censure it, Sit sirs, for I, although inuited, chalenge here Full flowing welcome, from his lippes that lends, As vnto me, so much to all my friends, And I begin in vnto ye. The Earle sits, and all do follow him. S. Wil. theres a cockrel tight, That learnes to crow from others, good my Earle, If that my boldnes may, challenge thy owne, Engadge vnto thy noblenes for euer, I promise whose performance lighly giues, Heart willingnes to boote, cods me fill wine.

Good ith beginning, let her dance her last Who fronts me with a Cornucopian wreath, Were she a wife sprung from the race of kings, Such bitter breathing followes, now ye lamps, Of spotted Nemmisis, burne blew, let the fall, Light on mischiefes selfe, that dallied lately in our wretchednes, tell her sad sorrow, tombs and epitafes tend her amazing obsequies, &amp; then liue free thou wrong'd soule from slanders cruelty.
