      <field name="fulltext">PRIMUS REX Mightye God in majestye, that rules the people of Judee, when thow one man wilt have pittye, and his sinnes forbye, send some tokeninge, lord, to mee, that ylke starre that I may see that Balaham sayd should ryse and bee in his prophecye. For well I wotte, forsooth iwys, that his prophecye sooth is. A starre should ryse tokninge of blys when Godes Sonne is borne. Therfore these lordes and I in fere in this mounte make our prayer devoutlye once in the yeare, for therto we binne sworne. SECUNDUS REX Yea, we that binne of Balahams bloode, that prophecyed of that sweete foodeâ when Balaack, that kinge soe woode, to curse would hee have made Godes people of Israell. But power fayled everye deale; to prophecye mankyndes heale that tyme happe hee haddâ therfore wee kinges of his kynde, I read wee take his wordes in mynde, grace in him if wee maye fynde that Godes Sonne shalbe. And goe wee praye, both one and all, into the Mounte Victoryall. Paraventure such grace may fall that starre that wee maye see. TERTIUS REX Syr, securlye I read on right; unto that hill I will me dight and there beseech God almight one us for to have mynde, and of that starre to have a sight. Worshippe wee all that sweete wight that Balaham to us beheight, that shall forbye mankynde. Saye, fellowe, take this coursere and abyde mee right here. Goe wee, syres, to our prayer, I read now in good faye. I have donne this manye a yere, and my auncetours that before mee were. Highe God, prince of power, thou comforte us todaye. Hic descendunt de equis et ibunt in montem. PRIMUS REX Lord, what tyme ys yt thy will Balahams prophecye to fullfill, thou give us grace, both lowd and styll, and by some signe us shewe. SECUNDUS REX Yea, lord, though wee bee unworthye, one thy men thou have mercye; and of thy birthe thou certefye her to thy knightes three. TERTIUS REX Lord God, leader of Israell, that dye would for mankyndes heale, thow come to us and not conceale, but bee our counselour. PRIMUS REX Of all this world thou art the well that shalbe called Emanuell. Deeme the, lord, with us to dwell, and graunte us our prayer. Tunc apparebit stella. PRIMUS REX A, syr roy, is vous ploitt, gardes sus sur vostre teste. SECUNDUS REX Une esteile issi est que syr vous reploiste. TERTIUS REX Aloies, soit luy une semblant de une virgin portant, come le semble, de une enfant em brace apportement. [PRIMUS REX] A, lord, blessed most thou bee, that one thy people hase pittye. Witterly now witten wee that wrought is our askinge. SECUNDUS REX That our prayer hard hasse hee I leve full well, well by my lewtee; for in the starre a chyld I see and verye tokeninge. TERTIUS REX Lordes, I read wee hethen hye, for I dare saye, and nothinge lye, fullfilled is Balahams prophecye; by this wee maye well knowe. Tunc reges iterum genua flectent, et Angelus portans stellam. PRIMUS REX Yea, lest this bee some fantasye yett praye we all speciallye; for if hee bee borne verelye more sygnes he will us shewe. ANGELUS Ryse up, yee kinges three, and commys anone after mee into the land of Judee as fast as yee may hye. The chyld yee seeke there shall yee see, borne all of a mayden free, that kinge of heaven and yearth shalbee and all mankynde forbye. Here the kinges ryse up. PRIMUS REX Lordes, hye wee heathen anone. Nowe wee binne bydden theder gonne, I will never bydeâby my bonneâ tyll I at him bee. SECUNDUS REX Yea, syrs, I read us everyechone dromodaryes to ryde upon, for swyfter beasts be there none. One I have, ye shall see. TERTIUS REX A dromodarye, in good faye, will goe lightly on his waye an hundreth myles upon a daye; such beasts nowe take wee. PRIMUS REX Lordes, and I leeve well maye that child would shorten well our waye that bringinge presentes to his paye, and most is of degree. Then goe downe to the beastes and ryde abowt. PRIMUS REX Alas, where is this starre iwent? Our light from us awaye is glent. Nowe wott I not where we bene lent, nor whitherward lyes our waye. SECUNDUS REX Praye we to God with good intent, to whome we bringe our present. Hee will never suffer us to be shent; that dare I bouldly saye. TERTIUS REX It is good that we enquire if any the waye can us lere. Saye, [belamye] that rydes there, tell us some tydinge. THE MESSINGER Syr, tell me what your will were. PRIMUS REX Can thou ought saye what place or where a child is borne that crowne shall beare and of the Jewes bee kynge? SECUNDUS REX We see the starre shine verey in the east in noble araye. Therfore wee come nowe this waye to worshippe him with wynne. MESSINGER Hould your peace, syrs, I you praye! For if kinge Herode here you soe saye, he would goe wood, by my faye, and flye out of his skynne. TERTIUS REX And sythe a kinge is soe nere, goe wee to him in all manere. MESSINGER Yee may well see hee wonnys here, a pallace in to dwell. But maye hee wott withowten were that anye is borne of more powere, you bringe yourselves in greate dangere such tidinges for to tell. Here the Messinger must goe to the kinge. Minstrells here must playe. O noble kinge and worthye conqueroure, crowned in gould, sittinge on hye, Mahound thee save longe in honoure! License I require to speake to thee. Tidings now, my lord, I shall you tell that these three kinge doe shewe unto mee. From whense the binne I knowe not well; yonder the stond, as yee may see. PRIMUS REX Syr roy, ryall and reverent, Deu vous gard, omnipotent. SECUNDUS REX Nos summes veneus comoplent, novelis de enquire. HERODES Bien soies venues, royes gent. Me detes tout vetere entent. TERTIUS REX Infant querenues de grand parent, et roy de celi et terre. HERODES Syrs, avise you what you sayne! Such tydinges makes my harte unfayne. I read you take those wordes agayne for feare of velanye. There is none soe great that me dare gayne, to take my realme and to attayne my power, but hee shall have payne and punished appertlye. I kinge of kinges, non soe keene; I soveraigne syre, as well is seene; I tyrant that maye both take and teene castell, towre, and towne! I weld this world withouten weene; I beate all those unbuxone binne; I drive the devills all bydeene deepe in hell adowne. For I am kinge of all mankynde; I byd, I beate, I loose, I bynde; I maister the moone. Take this in myndâ that I am most of might. I am the greatest above degree that is, or was, or ever shalbe; the sonne yt dare not shine on me and I byd him goe downe. Noe raigne to fall, shall non be free; nor noe lord have that libertie that dare abyde and I byd flee, but I shall cracke his crowne. Non farre nor neare that doth me nyeâ whoe wrathes me I shall him nye; for everye freake I dare defye that nyll me paye ne plaese. But ye be beane, I shall you beate; there is noe man for you shall treate. All for wrothe, see how I sweate! My hart is not at ease. Staffe. For all men may wott and seeâ both hee and you all threeâ that I am kinge of Gallilee, whatsoever he sayes or does. Sword. What the devell should this bee? A boye, a growme of lowe degree, should raygne above my ryalltee and make me but a goose, Cast up. that ringes and raignes so riallye? All grace and goodnes I have to give. There is noe prince but hee shall plye to doe my hartes ease. But now you may both here and see that I reconed up my rialtye. I red you all be ruled by mee and found mee for to please. PRIMUS REX âVidimus stellam eius in oriente et venimus cum muneribus adorare eum.â Syr, wee see the starre appeare in the east withouten were in a merveilouse manere, together as we cann praye. SECUNDUS REX Wee see never non soe cleare; by it the waye we could lere. But when we came to your land here then vanished it awaye. TERTIUS REX By prophecye well wotten wee that a child born should bee to rule the people of Judee, as was sayd many a yeare. HERODES That is false, by my lewtee, for in mauger of you all three this realme moves all of mee; other kinges non shall be here. But sythen you speake of prophecye, I will witt anon in hie whether yee saye sooth or lyeâ my clarke soone shall see. Syr Doctor, that cheife art of clergie, looke up thy bookes of prophecye of Daniell, David, and Isaye, and what thou seest say thou mee. These kinges be come a farre way to seeke a child, I hard saye, that should be borne in this cuntraye my kingdome to destroye. Seeke eych leafe, I thee praye, and what thou findes in good faye tell now here, for I dare laye that all these lordes lye. DOCTOR Nay, my lord, bee ye bould; I trowe noe prophetes before would write anythinge your hart to could or your right to denye. But syth your grace at this tyme would that I the prophets declare should, of Christes comminge as they have tould, the trueth to certyfie, I beseech your ryall majestee with patience of your benignitie the trueth to here, and pardone mee there sayenges to declare. HERODES Nay, my true clarke, that will not I debate with thee; therfore in hye looke well on everye prophecye. For nothing that thou spare, but search the trueth of Esaye, Ezechiell, Nauum, and Jheremye, Micheas, Abdias, and Zacharye, of Christ what they doe saye. Looke alsoe upon Malachye, Aggeus, Oseas, and Sophonye, Joell, Amos, and Abacuck in hye; looke non be left awaye. [DOCTOR] âNon auferetur sceptrum de Juda et dux de foemore eius, donec veniet qui mittendus est et erit ipse expectatio gentium.â Genesis, quadragessimo nono. The Holy Scripture maketh declaration by patryarckes and prophettes of Christes nativitie, when Jacob prophecied by playne demonstration, sayde the realme of Juda and eke the regaltye from that generation never taken should bee untill hee were come that most mightye is, sent from the Father, kinge of heavenly blys. And now fulfilled is Jacobs prophecye; for kinge Herode that is nowe rayninge is noe Jewe borne nor of that progenye, but a stranger by the Romans made there kinge; and the Jewes knowe non of ther blood descendinge by succession to claime the scepter and regaltye; wherfore Christe is nowe borne our kinge and messye. HERODES A bill. That is false, by Mahound full of might! That ould villard Jacob, doted for age, shall withold by no prophecye the tytle and right of Romans hye conquest which to mee in heritage is fallen for ever, as prince of hye parentage. If anye other kinge or messye intend it to wynne, his head from his bodye with this sword shall I twynne. Et dicat, âRead one.â DOCTOR âCum venerit sancta sanctorum cessabit unctio vestra.â Daniell, fulfilled with heavenly grace, prophecied alsoe by divine inspiration that when he was come that of all holye was most holiest in yearth, to take his habitation in the wombe of a virgin, and by his blessed incarnation out of Sathans band to deliver mankynd whom synne originall most pitiously did byndâ then both unctions, sacrifices, and rittes ceremonyall of the ould testament with legall observation shall utterly cease and take there end fynall through Christes commynge, which for mans salvation a newe testament should ordayne by devine operation, offeringe himselfe in sacrafice for mankyndes offence, which from heaven was exiled through his greate negligence. HERODES Fye on that dreame-reader! Such dotardes never shall, ney noe sleepie sluggard, make my right title cease. But I shall knightlye keepe yt, whatsoever shall befall, agaynst that yonge godlinge. And if hee ones doe presse this kingdome to clayme, or put mee to distresse, his head of shall I hewe. Yett looke yf thou finde there wher this boye is borne for whom these kinges enquire. [DOCTOR] âEt tu Bethlem quidem terra Juda nequaquam minima es in principibus Judae. Ex te enim exiet dux qui reget populum meum Israell.â Michei quinto et Mathei secundo. Micheas, inflamed with ghostly inspiration, prophecied that Bethlem should a child forth bringe. Ruler of Godes people and of the Jewes nation should hee be borne, of Israell to be kinge. Alsoe Esaye and Jheremye, full vertuous of beinge, with divers others mo fulfilled with grace, of Christes comminge prophecied while they were livinge. DOCTOR âAmbulabunt gentes in lumine tuo et reges in splendore ortus tui.â Esaui sexagessimo. Esawe, to whom the spirit of prophecye was singulerly given through the Holy Ghost, in his tyme prophicied that kinges witterlye and folkes of strange natyons and from sundrye coastsâ that princes death to magnifie, which of might is mosteâ should walke in great light; and brightnes should apere, as did unto these kinges in a bright starre shininge clere. HERODES âEffundam super parvulum istum furorem meum et super consilium juvenum, disperdam parvulos de fores, et juvenes in plateis morientur gladio meo.â Alas, what presumption should move that pevish page or any elvish godlinge to take from me my crowne? Cast downe the sword. But, by Mahound, that boye for all his greate outrage shall die under my hand, that elfe and vile [congion]. And all his pertakers I shall slea and beate downe, and both of him and his finall distruction make. Such vengeance and eke crueltye on them all will I take that non such a slaughter was seene or hard before, syth Athalia here raigned, that fell and furiouse queene, that made slea all men children that of kinges blood were when her soone was dead. So for to wreake my teene I shall hewe that harlott with my bright brond so keene into peeces smale. Yett looke and search agayne if these kinges shall him finde and his presence attayne.

David, of all prophettes called most prepotent, prophecied that kinges of Tharsis and Arabye with misticall giftes shall come and presente that lord and prince, that kinge and hye messye, of Abrahams seede descendinge lineallyeâ which kinges with great treasure here in presence, to seeke him as soverraigne and lawde his magnificence. My lord, by prophecie is proved you beforne that in Bethlem should bee borne a child to save that was forlorne and rule all Israell. HERODES Breake a sword. By cockes sowle, thou art forsworne! Have donne! Those bookes were rent and torne. For hee shalbe noe kinge in crowne, but I fullye in my weale. And maugard David, that sheppard with his slinge, Esaye, Jheremye, with all there osspringe, here gett noe other messye or kynge from my right title to expell. Cast up. What a devill is this to saye: that I should be disproved and put awayeâ syth my right is soe vereyâ for a boyes boast? This realme is myne and shalbe aye, manfullye maynteane yt while I may, though hee bringe with him todaye the devill and all his hoaste. Cast up. But goes you forth, you kinges three, and enquire if it soe bee. But algates come agayne by mee, for you I thinke to feede. And if hee bee of such degree, him will I honour as donne yee, as falles for his dignitie in word, thought, and deede. PRIMUS REX By your leave, syr, and have good daye, tyll we come agayne this waye. SECUNDUS REX Syr, as sonne as ever wee maye; and as we seene, soe shall wee saye.

By cockes sowle, come they agayne all three traytors shall bee slayne, and that ylke swedlinge swayneâ I shall choppe of his head. Godes grace shall them not gayne, nor noe prophecye save them from payne. That rocked rybauld, and I may rayne, rufully shalbe his reade. By Mahound full of mightes, tomorrowe I will send after my knightes to rule my realme and my rightes agaynst this boyes boaste, and rayse the contrye one everye syde, all that ever may goe or ryde. Soe shall this boye loose his pryde, for all his greatest hoste. This boye doth mee soe greatly anoye that I wax dull and pure drye. Have done and fill the wyne in hye; I dye but I have drinke! Fill fast and lett the cuppes flye, and goe wee heathen hastelye; for I must ordeyne curiouslye agaynst these kynges comminge. Finis</field>
