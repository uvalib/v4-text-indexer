Put the lighted match to himâ (The lighted match is put to his noseâhe yawnsâsees the light, and goes to sleep again). âHis bottom is sound, Your hand poize the bowl, my boys, we dash o'er the deep. (All laugh and repeat) While the jolly, jolly grog's afloat, &amp;c. 2. I'll wager these arms 'gainst your cutlass, old boy, I snuff out the candle at five yards first fire; Hold it CÃ¦sar (CÃ¦sar holds the candle) don't shake so, Thereâzounds! I've let fly!â (Blackbeard fires and snuffs out the candle,) I've wonâpoize the bowl again, brave boys poize it higher. (All laugh and repeat) While the jolly, jolly grog's afloat, &amp;c. Blackbeard orders CÃ¦sar to use the telescopeâhe does so, and informs him he spies a sailâBlackbeard looks himself, and a vessel heaves in sight bearing Mogul colours; officers alternately examine her force through the telescopeâboatswain whistles all to their quartersâthey arm themselves.

Blackbeard and Crew rush through the Cabin doorsâall prepared for action, followed by Nancy AND William, when Blackbeard, &amp;c. proceed on deckâthey express their detestation of him and his crewâdrum beats to quartersâthey swear fidelity to each otherâexchange tobacco boxesâhe flies to action, and she sings the following BALLAD. [1.] My Willy was a sailor bold, He lov'd no other lass but me; To earn for Anne a store of gold, My constant Willy went to Sea. When on his trembling lip âfarewellâ Impressive hung, it rent my heart; I felt my throbbing bosom swell, And vow'd from Willy ne'er to part! 2. In jacket blue, and trowsers neat, Snow-white that play'd around my knee; I join'd the ship in Willy's fleet, Most dear to Anne, and cross'd the Sea. A storm came onârude tempests blewâ A Pirate's flag appall'd each heart! We struckâthey forc'd him join their crew, I still from Willy scorn'd to part. 3. He knows me not as his true love, But a kind messmate makes to me; His truth, his constancy I prove, For I'm his constant theme at Sea. Link'd thus by love, two minds unite, Each bless'd is with a faithful heartâ I'll join him in the raging fight, Nor e'en in death from Willy part. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. Between Decks. Strong cannonading kept upâthe crew working the guns, &amp;c.âSeamen coming to and fro, and up and down from stairs in the centre, supposed to be from the deck of the ship. DIALOGUE CATCH. Stand to your guns, our cannons thunder, Soon shall strike the foe with wonder, Fire!âfire away! (A Sailor comes from above.) We've rak'd em on the larboard quarter, A shot, my hearts, 'tween wind and waterâ She strikesâshe strikes, huzza! (Others come from above deck) Full of riches, brave messmates, we take her in tow, Under hatches her crew will be stow'd soon below. A Princess! our brave Captain's prize! (Another Sailor rushes down with the Mogul's colours) The Mogul's vaunting colours are torn to a rag, Triumphant above flies the Pirates black flag! Which the World's daring effort defies! SOLOâBOATSWAIN. Now bout Ship, put the rudder boys, Spring up the sportive gale! To harbour, girls, and boozing boys, We merrily set sail!â With fol de rol, &amp;c. Cho. Now bout ship, &amp;c. At the close of the chorus they merrily ascend, rejoicing at their victory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IV. Entrance into the Cabin, as before. Enter several Pirates bearing plunder, which they deposit in the cabin, after which Blackbeard with PART OF THE CREW ENTER, exultinglyâ Ismene (a Mogul Princess) is brought forward in chains by CÃ¦sarâBlackbeard appears enamoured of, and releases herâTHE Boatswain, &amp;c. bring on Abdallah, who refuses to deliver his sword but to the Captainâkneels and delivers it to Blackbeard, who receives it with ferocious dignity, and gives it CÃ¦sarâIsmene perceiving her lover, they embrace âare torn asunder by Blackbeard, who surrenders him to the care of William and Nancy to cast him into the holdâand hurries Ismene into his cabin.âWilliam gazes on Abdallah, and, recollecting his features, is going to throw himself at his feet, when, the sound of drum and fife being heard on deck, they hurry off. Enter Boatswain, &amp;c. SOLOâBOATSWAIN. [1.] In the good ship Revenge how we've spank'd through the Ocean, She's flush to our purpose, you ne'er saw the like; Balls and bullets whiz by, but ne'er cause an emotion, Because, 'till we're bowl'd down, we never will strike. Thus success and seaman's cheer glad the jolly Buccaneer. 2. Fond of change, in all weathers and climates we're roving, Now a sort of hard tussle, and now a snug booze; With the girls and a fiddle, sometimes kind and lovingâ Then see pop'd off a messmate, and step in his shoes. Still success, &amp;c. 3. Well stor'd now with plunder, at nine knots we're steering, To where copper fair ones will greet us on shore; There we'll laugh, quaff, and sing, and with kissing and swearing, Our cargo see out, then to sea boys for more. Thus success, &amp;c. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE V. The Road of Madagascar. The wings, &amp;c. representing appropriate foliage, &amp;c.âa kind of fortification of cane work on one side of the stage, leading to the residence of Blackbeard, from which the piratical colours are pending. Orra (Blackbeard's wife) seated under a plantain treeâA Negro Boy fanning herâTWO Female Slaves waitingâshe rises and looks wistfully over the Sea, pointing to the colours, regretting the absence of her husband, and praying for his speedy returnâthen comes forward, followed by a Negro boy. BALLADâNEGRO BOY. [1.] Tho' sunny beams the sky adorn, And glad the laughing Buckra's eye; I see poor missee weep and mourn, Massa return or missee die. Sing chick a ching, &amp;c. 2. When 'gainst her home de storm beat loud, And tempests roar their lullaby; Her starry eye in tear she shroud, Massa return or missee die. Sing chick a ching, &amp;c. Blackbeard's ship is seen at a distance towing in his prizeâthey anchor, and the ship's boat rows to shore; from which CÃ¦sar lands, and informs Orra of her husband's successâshe, delighted, orders him to call all the slaves, Male and Female, around her; and CÃ¦sar, at her request, commands them to join in a SLAVE DANCE, to welcome him on shore.âAs it is nearly finished, Blackbeard lands from his state barge, handing Ismene down the accommodation plank, followed by Pirates and Prisoners bearing part of the rich cargo of their prizeâas he descends, his slaves prostrate themselves, Orra kisses his handâhe presents her the Mogul Princess, on whom she looks with a jealous eyeâtells her he entrusts her to her careâshe receives her with apparent complacency; but, aside, views her with disgustâthey retire through the fortifications. Blackbeard orders the pirates to make merry; but, perceiving Abdallah in the barge, orders him to be brought on shore, and commands one of his officers to blow his brains outâwho refuses to do it in cold bloodâwhich much irritating the marauding tyrant, he shoots him dead.âWilliam and Nancy, at the same period, descending from the barge, he gives them orders to dispatch Abdallah, bidding them to beware of the Cockswain's fate, and retires, threatening.âWilliam prepares to obeyâAbdallah takes off his turban, and William, recognizing his former deliverer, addresses him in the following BALLADâWILLIAM. [1.] My friend when a captive, and rhino ran low, And few did my sorrows regard; When nought but misfortune had ta'en me in tow, And the storm in my bosom beat hard. With a kind feeling heart, did you comfort impart, And shall I that kindness forgetâ No, Yeo ho! never fear, fortune's vane still may veer, But a sailor won't die in your debt. 2. My dungeon you cheer'd in your own native land, Of slavery lighten'd the chain; The stout bark of gratitude never will strand, Like me then taste freedom again. 'Twas a kind feeling heart that relief did impart, And shall I that kindness forgetâ No, Yeo ho! never fear, should for this death be near, 'Tis but once, I'll not die in your debt. After which, hearing noisy mirth of the slaves, without, and dreading discovery, he hastily releases him, presenting his sword, and on CÃ¦sar's approach, intimates his prisoner has escapedâCÃ¦sar enters Blackbeard's fortification, and William and Nancy hurry off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VI. Interior of Blackbeard's Fort. Enter Orra and IsmeneâOrra accuses Ismene of perfidy in depriving her of her husband's affectionâshe throws herself at her feet, disclaiming the idea, and lamenting her own miserable situation âoffers jewels for the means of escape, dreading the very sight of BlackbeardâOrra consents, and is opening a sliding pannel for that purpose, when her husband's voice compels her hastily to close it, and appear attentive to her prisonerâBlackbeard ENTERS musingâorders Orra to retire, who obeys him with reluctanceâhe then throws himself at the feet of the Princessâshe breaks from him, accuses him of cruelty to his wifeâhe draws a pistol from his belt, and swears that shall dispatch Orra, should she be any bar to their happinessâIsmene shudders at the thought, and beseeches him rather to dispatch herâcharmed with her intrepidity, he more fervently addresses herâOrra re-enters, and surprizes himâ he attempts to discharge his pistolâit is snatched from his grasp by Ismeneâa pauseâCÃ¦sar WHISTLES without, ENTERS, and falls on his knees trembling âBlackbeard demands the cause, he presents the following scroll: âYour Prisoner has escaped.â During this, Orra, with feigned affection, re-opens the pannel, and she and Ismene escapeâBlackbeard on turning round seems petrified on not perceiving themâobserves the pannel openâa pauseâconvinced they have escaped that way, they draw their swords, and follow, vowing revenge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VII. A West Indian View. Enter Orra and Ismene much agitatedâIsmene thanking her for her seeming friendship, and Orra shewing a disposition, the first fair opportunity, of destroying herâIsmene wishes to take her leave âOrra intimates she has not yet reached a place of safety, and fearing a pursuit hurries her offâBlackbeard and CÃ¦sar ENTER, and revengefully pursue themâAbdallah having lost his way, and not knowing which to take, pursues their track:â Lieutenant Maynard and Crew, of the Pearl, ENTERâA Drunken Negro sings withoutâ one of the crew is dispatched after, and returns WITH HIM. DUET. Seaman and Drunken Negro. In search of a Pirate infesting these seas, Whose cruelty makes him the dread of the coast; In some creek or inlet, who rides at his ease, And makes death and carnage and plunder his boast. Who has play'd such mad pranks, robb'd the ocean so neatly, Resolv'd are our Tars to destroy him completely: The yard arms prepared are, from which they're to hang. Drunken Negro. [1.] Ah massa, dat hard to my poor vay of tinking, To choak de poor troat, dat so doat upon drinking, But me still drink a little, come ting a ting tang. 2.
