      <field name="fulltext">Aufer ab aspectu nostro funesta, satelles, Regis dona tui: pejus de CÃ¦sare vestrum, Quam de Pompeio meruit scelus. Unica belli PrÃ¦mia civilis, victis donare salutem Perdidimus.? Lucan. Lib. 9.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mr. WILKS. When Roman Arms their Hostile Terrors hurl'd, And march'd in Triumph o'er the Conquer'd World; When Plunder'd Provinces in Ruins mourn'd, And Captive Kings the Victor's Carr adorn'd: When proud Patricians gave whole Realms away, And Crown'd their Vassals with Imperial Sway: No Wonder, then, the same Ambitious Lords, For Want of Foes, drew on themselves their Swords. Pompey and CÃ¦sar rul'd that World they won, 'Till each determin'd to be Lord alone: Hence flam'd that Fire, whose Civil Rage destroy'd The glorious Liberty their Sires enjoy'd: Pharsalia's Field at length decides the Day, And gave Mankind, to CÃ¦sar's Arms, a Prey. Thus stood their State, when vanquish'd Pompey fled From CÃ¦sar's Sword, to ask Ãgyptian Aid. âThere starts our Play, and into Action draws What Fate befel the pity'd Pompey's Cause: A Charge well-worthy of an abler Muse; But none, a Post, for being too good, refuse! Warm'd by the Subject, and by Roman Fire, Our Bard gives all that Lucan cou'd inspire! Yet what avails his boasted Care and Pains, While Gothic Taste prefers, to labour'd Scenes, The mute Exploits of Motley Harlequins? Others, perhaps, in the Politer Throng, Might better have been pleas'd, had CÃ¦sar Sung. Far be it from us to question your Delight! To be, at Pleasure wrong, is English Right! In vain for boasted Freedom you declare, Unless you keep the Libertyâto Err! âSince then rank Farce is grown a Taste so new, No wonder we exhibit Nonsense too! And tho' w'are but Beginners there, we'll drudge, And entertain as low as Crouds can judge! While plain October can secure their Votes, Why shou'd we spill Champaign on vulgar Throats? Howe'er, to-night (by such gross Scenes betray'd) We call the Roman Julius to our Aid: On You it lies to save the Cause of Verse, And give the Palm to Tragedy, or Farce.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, ALEXANDRIA in Egypt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Nulla fides unquam miseros elegit amicos. Luc. lib. 8. PHOTINUS, ACHILLAS. Photinus. Our fertile Ãgypt, now, no more shall groan, Beneath the Ravage of intestine War; Nor, from the Contests of divided Sway, Rebellion have th'Excuse of Anarchy. Our plenteous Nile, now flows for Ptolomey! While Cleopatra, by his Arms reduc'd, Perceives her Empire bounded, by this Palace; There, like a Criminal of State, confin'd, She stoops for Favours, where she once bestow'd them. Achil. And yet so equal, so unchang'd her Spirit, She seems not to desire, or not t'have lost A Throne: The same majestick gracious Smile Plays in her Eye, insensible of Foes, Or seeming not to know them. Pho. All dissembled! Train'd up in Courts, she knows to mask her Malice; But were she loose again to Power, this Head, That honestly projected her Confinement, Wou'd be the earliest Victim of her Vengeance. Achil. 'Tis true, my Lord; and that one Point consider'd, Why is her Verge of Liberty so large? Why is she suffer'd still to train along This lofty Palace, with her Crouds attending? To revel in the bow'ry Shades, to range The sportive Forest, and command its Pleasures? To spread her silken Toils beneath the Stream? With tow'ring Falcons to distress the Dove? Or like Diana, with her Wood-nymphs grac'd, To mount the breathing Hills, and sweep the Vale, Chacing with cheerful Horn, the Stag, the Boar? Pho. Thou know'st, Achillas, she's the People's Idol; Over whose Hearts, her Eyes usurp an Empire! Conscious of Beauty, she delights to please, And when in publick View she moves, Her radiant Charms attract their Adoration! Then from her Speech, such melting Musick flows, Nor more her Words, than tuneful Voice perswade. Therefore too close Restraint were dangerous: This Shew of Freedom will amuse the Commons, Who pierce not to th'Abridgment of her Sway; But were they utterly refus'd her Sight, Or but her lovely Person hardly treated; The Force of Ãgypt wou'd not curb their Rage, Nor Ptolomey were safe upon his Throne. Achil. 'Tis not the murm'ring Multitude I fear, But powerful Rome's Resentment wakes my Thought; How may the jealous Senate bear this Change? Whose awful Voices have decreed, that both Sister and Brother, as the late King's Will Bequeath'd, should equal hold the Reins of Empire? Nor will, I fear, great Pompey brook her Treatment, Who stands alike the Guardian of them both. Pho. Pompey and Rome have weightier Cares at Home. The Storm of civil War, now rais'd by CÃ¦sar, Withdraws their Insolence from foreign Realms, To waste their Valour on their proper Subjects! Their distant Care of us, is but their Pride, And Wantonness of Power; intestine Jars May humble them to Justice, and reduce Their Empire to its old Italian Bounds. Or say, that on Pharsalia's dreadful Plain, (Where now these rival Lions hourly watch Each other as their Prey) Conquest shou'd give The Roman World to Pompey, or to CÃ¦sar; 'Twill then be Time enough, when we are sure Whose Nod we must obey, to change our Measures. Achil. Behold the King! and in his youthful Eye Some Joy unusual sparkles into Triumph. Enter Ptolomey with an open Letter. Septimius, Achoreus following. Ptol. O Photinus! Osiris now has heard Our Vows! at length this Mistress of the Earth, Imperious Rome, has lost her Liberty! This haughty Dame that gave her Laws to Monarchs, Whose private Citizens durst proudly vaunt Their Scorn of Crowns, and boast of scepter'd Vassals; This wanton Rome, impregnated with Power, By civil Discord, teems her own Destruction: Pharsalia's Field has given the World to CÃ¦sar; And Pompey is a Fugitive in Ãgypt. All his late Triumphs, Lawrels, and Renown, Are now the Spoils, and grace the Brows of CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦sar, who warm with Injuries, and Conquest, Will well avenge the Cause of slighted Kings, And bend the Neck of Rome to one victorious Lord. Pho. When our Oppressors feel the Fetters they impos'd, Our Chains are lightned by the Loads they bear. Ptol. We who are doom'd to wear precarious Crowns, With less Regret, shall pay our Homage to A King, than an inferiour proud Republick! Pho. But you were speaking, Sir, of Pompey's Flight, And, as I think, of his Arrival here? Ptol. The Remnant of his Fleet, three shatter'd Barks, Now anchor in our Port; where with his fair, His sad Cornelia, and some few Dependents, Who share the hopeless Fortunes of Pharsalia, He waits upon our Will; having first sent On Shore a Friend, with this Address to ask Protection, and if possible, our Aid to check The Course of CÃ¦sar, and inforce the War. There, more at large you'll read, how unsecure [Gives them the Letter. Is all the tow'ring Strength of human Glory. Acho. He tells us here, that Parthia's warlike King (Whose Conquest over Crassus is so fam'd,) Had offer'd to receive him; but himself Assur'd his Fortunes more Relief in Egypt, Where his late Service to your royal Father, He knows, will be remember'd in his Welcome. Ptol. 'Tis true, when bold Rebellion press'd my Father, Pompey procur'd the Senate's timely Aid, Which crush'd the Tumult, and confirm'd his Throne; And Benefits conferr'd on Dignity distrest, Entail their Obligation on its Heirs. But Pompey, in that utmost Exigence, Tho' generous, was not more a Friend than CÃ¦sar; Whose thousand Talents from his private Store, Advanc'd, gave Life, and Sinews to our Cause! Thus stands my doubtful Gratitude divided: Pompey's Misfortunes plead for our Relief; But CÃ¦sar's Greatness warns us to abjure him: To make a Foe of CÃ¦sar nowâwere frantick Virtue; And to desert a Friend's Distressâignoble. Hard-fated Choice! must I, to save my Crown, Yield up this hunted Pompey's Head to CÃ¦sar? Or (saving Pompey) make my Crown his Prey? What then can guard me, but your riper Wisdom? Your Counsel, Lords, is now my last Resource, To shield your Prince from Ruin, or Dishonour. Acho. To guard your Crown, Sir, is our eldest Duty: But what are Crowns that are not worn with Honour? We grant, the Obligations of your State To Pompey, and to CÃ¦sar's Friendship, equal; Yet, as one only begs immediate Payment, Pompey's Distress seems here to turn the Scale, And weighs up conscious Honour to relieve him. CÃ¦sar makes no Demand upon your Crown; His prosperous Arms not ask, but give Support: At worst, his thousand Talents might be paid; Then are you unconfin'd, in Gratitude; Then Sir, what's due to Pompey, bears no Question. If 'tis objected, CÃ¦sar may resent Your Favours to his mortal Foe; 'tis true, If soâmy Councel were most hazardous: But who, what Enemy can say of CÃ¦sar, That he provok'd him, by an Act of Honour? How is he fam'd for Mercy to his Foes? Then will he not forgive a friendly Error, Whose Motive has th'Excuse of Gratitude? But shou'd you offer Violence to Pompey, How may great CÃ¦sar take Advantage of Your Crime, and build his Fame upon your Ruin? Therefore my Thoughts advise you, Sir, be grateful, Supply the Wants of Pompey, and protect him: Appeal to CÃ¦sar's Honour, and you gain him; But Pompey's injur'd Life were such an Act, As neither Gods would bear, nor CÃ¦sar pardon. Ptol. Achoreus has our Thanksâyour Thoughts, Achillas. Achil. Achoreus, Sir, has spoke, as well becomes His holy Function, and a faithful Subject: But yet how far the Laws of Policy May warrant what his Wisdom has advanc'd, I own, with me, as yet, is undetermin'd. CÃ¦sar has Virtue, but he wants not Art: And tho' no doubt he wishes Pompey dead, Nay, in his Heart, wou'd bless the Hand that smote him; Yet these are Thoughts his Glory must conceal. Therefore who knows, but Pompey's Death reveng'd, Might be the Mask his Joy wou'd chuse to wear? If so, the Death of Pompey might undo us: But when again we weigh it, as the End, The Summit, and the Crown of CÃ¦sar's Conquests: When we reflect, that they who give Repose, And full Security to CÃ¦sar's Power, Can never be themselves unsafeâthen, Sir, The Death of Pompey is the Life of Ãgypt. Ptol. Your Sentiments, Septimius? Sept. Sir, my Sword Speaks me, I am unfit for grave Debates; A Roman born, my Science has been War: My Services, by Pompey's Scorn o'erlook'd, Have chang'd my thankless native Soil for Egypt, Whose Interests now my Heart's last Blood shall serve. If Ãgypt then is lost, Septimius is an Exile; And what can Ãgypt save, but CÃ¦sar's Friendship? What gain that Friendship, but your Hate to Pompey? What prove that Hatred real, but his Head? Which trembling on a Spear, to CÃ¦sar's View, Crowns all his Toils, for, then, unrivall'd Empire. CÃ¦sar knows Men, and bears no lukewarm Friend; With him, who stands suspected, is condemn'd: Be cautious, Sir, he is not serv'd by halves! As then Sincerity must gain his Heart; So must we strike our Daggers home, to Pompey's. If your Ãgyptian Resolution faints, I have a Roman Arm, that wants Employment; The Blame, or Merit of the Deed be mine; And while 'tis mine alone, Fame shall confess, Pompey, like Rome her self, cou'd only fall By Romans. Acho. Isis and Osiris guard us! Ptol. Your Voice, Photinus, now concludes our Measures! Shall Ãgypt league with Pompey, or with CÃ¦sar? Pho. I grant your Kingdom, Sir, to each indebted: Pompey begs for Payment: CÃ¦sar expects it. If you fail Pompey, Pompey may reproach you. If you slight CÃ¦sar, CÃ¦sar can revenge it. Pompey's Relief demands your certain Ruin! CÃ¦sar's Ambition will expect his Head. To talk of Obligations, Gratitude, And Honour balanc'd, with a Nation's Safety, Better befits the dreaming Sanctity Of Anchorets, than Vigilance of Monarchs! When Empires are at Stake, nothing is Just, Or Great, but what implicitly maintains 'em. Pompey is routedâand in Compliment Invites us to partake his Ruin. Gods! Because he sav'd us once, does he conclude He therefore has a Right to our Destruction? For now to aid him, 'gainst the Arms of CÃ¦sar, Were to renew the Giant's War with Heaven. What Laws of Nations, Justice, or of Honour, What Contracts, Leagues, or Treaties bind us down, To prop this falling Pompey with our Bones, To be by CÃ¦sar crush'd, and trampled into Ashes? No Sir, the Ruin Pompey brings, repel Upon his Head! joyn you the Cause, the Gods Have own'd, and turn your Sword on CÃ¦sar's Foes! One Blow secures his Friendship, and your Crown! If not for Ãgypt, strike for Ptolomey. Consider your divided Title, Sir, Your royal Sister's Claim, her Provocations! Her Arts! her female Spleen, and Beauty! Dressing her Wrongs in Tears, and CÃ¦sar amorous! Her soft Complainings blowing him to Flames! Will he refuse to right so fair a Suitress? At least, Sir, give him not Pretence to inforce Your Father's Will, or what were worse, T'invest her solely with the sov'raign Power, And veil his Vengeance, in an Act of Justice. Ptol. No more! that Thought embitters all Remorse. Were Pompey dearer to my Heart than Life; Rather than serve my Sister's haughty Pride, My Rage, like Thunder, in the Port shou'd sink him. Achillas, and Septimius, you obey The Orders of Photinusâhark, your Ear! [Whispering apart. Acho. Nay, then the horrid Resolution's fixt! My farther Counsel will be useless here! Hence then, to royal Cleopatra haste, With Pompey's Fate alarm her nobler Soul, And try what Terrors may be form'd, to save him. [Aside.] Exit. Pho. Delay may give him Doubts of his Reception; He may retreat, and hoist his Sails for Asia. The present Hour's too precious to be lost; In Execution of distressful Measures, 'Tis Expedition gives them Life and Lustre. Ptol. You then Achillas and Septimius haste, Take to your Aid the Parties you have nam'd; Rush on the Instant, to a deathless Fame, And give Repose to Ãgypt. Sept. And to Pompey. [Exeunt Achil. and Sept. Ptol. The Resolution fix'd recalls my Spirit! I am again my self! set free! I reign! Conclude we then that Pompey is no more, And that his Death buries my Sister's Claim: For howsoe'er on CÃ¦sar she relies, Her Right had stronger Hope from Pompey's Aid, Whose Friendship to my Father was so firm, He undertook, as Warden of his Will, To place my Sister on the Throne, my Equal! But nowâ Pho. Those Glories, with her Champion perish! Whose Head secures you in the Heart of CÃ¦sar. Ptol. But see my Sister; in her Look, Surprize, And wild Emotion, eager to be heard. Enter Cleopatra. Cleo. Sir, I'm inform'd, great Pompey is arriv'd, And that your Council pauses to receive him. Ptol. Your Voice and Gesture, Madam, speak Reproach; Which neither fits your State to give, or mine To bear: Kings are accountable to none. Cleo. To more than Subjects, by the Laws of Honour: Their Lustre stands on Eminencies fixt, That the inferior World may gaze, and censure! How vain is Glory, when it gives not Wonder! How mean is Majesty, that dares be thankless? Ptol. Your Cares for Pompey, are at my Expence. Your Bounty's great, from want of Power to give: Were Ãgypt yours, your Virtue wou'd have Bounds. Cleo. Were not your Virtue limited, my Power And Right in Ãgypt, wou'd to yours be equal. I send, at least, to Pompey's Aid, my Wishes, And that's a Merit, which your Greatness wants. Why go you not in Person, to receive him? Ptol. I know my self, and know the State of Pompey. Septimius and Achillas have their Orders. Cleo. Are those fit Agents for your Gratitude? Owe you not your Crown to Pompey's Favour? Ptol. Be due, what may, to him; now CÃ¦sar claims it. Cleo. Can you forget such godlike Benefits? Ptol. Was CÃ¦sar's Gold out-weigh'd by Pompey's Speeches? Has CÃ¦sar less Demands on Gratitude, Because he can confirm the Crown he sav'd? Cleo. But hapless Pompey, not reliev'd, must perish! Ptol. And if reliev'd, you'll make my Peace with CÃ¦sar! Fair Sister, you may spare your Intercessions, They're lost on one, that knows their Motive! You live in Hope, that Pompey's Fortunes may Retrieve your own; you think him bound t'enforce My Father's Will, and therefore wish him Power; This is the thin Disguise your Virtue wears! Hence flows this Torrent of Benevolence! But Madam, know, the Wiles of your Ambition, With Pompey's Hopes, may perish in the Port! Cleo. Immortal Gods! and dare you own the Treason? Ptol. I glory in the Deed, that guards my Crown, And levels your Presumption to Obedience. Cleo. Obedience to Superiors, must be due; And who, in Ãgypt, is the Queen's Superior? The Force, and Fortune of injurious Arms, 'Tis true, have robb'd me of my Regal Power: But my Soul's Empire is in me alone. That soars above the Reach of Violence, And from its Heighth, with Scorn regards your Triumph. Ptol. Be, then, that mighty Monarch of your Mind; Rage on, and shew how ill you govern there, While I content my self with ruling Ãgypt. Cleo. First, Sir, redeem your self from Slavery! From the pernicious Counsellors that sway you! That, thro' the Heart of Pompey, strike at me: That with false Politicks mis-lead your Youth, To brand our Ãgypt with eternal Infamy! Pho. Photinus, Madam, dares avow the Counsel. Cleo. I spoke, Sir, to the King; when I descend To you, then take with me that Liberty. Ptol. Pass it, my Friend; the Insult is to me. Pho. Therefore a Subject less might bear it, Sir. Ptol. I grant, her earlier Birth shou'd give Example; But female Imperfections must be born. She finds her Hopes of Empire lost with Pompey. Cleo. I scorn the Thought. If Interest were my View, I shou'd not plead for Pompey, but for CÃ¦sar! Ptol. Your secret Views, are to yourself best known. To me they seem perplext, and intricate. Cleo. Since you provoke me then, receive a Secret, That will, at once, confound your barbarous Counsels, And make your Merit, in lost Pompey's Blood, Hateful to CÃ¦sar, as to Gods, and me. Ptol. Discharge this Thunder then; I stand prepar'd, And ready for the Bolt. Cleo. Attend, and tremble. When rude Rebellion seiz'd on royal Power, And drove our exil'd Father from his Throne; To Rome, as to his only Hope, (as now Pompey to Ãgypt flies) he fled for Succour: And to incite the Senate's nobler Pity, My self and you attended his Distresses. Your Age was unsusceptible of Care, But mine (or Flattery deceiv'd me well) Bloom'd in full Beauty, and attracted Hearts: Yet of my Conquests, I shall boast but one: CÃ¦sar pretended Love: I urg'd him to a Proof: He gave the noblest: he restor'd our Ãgypt. Pompey was then his Friend; him CÃ¦sar wrought, At my Desire, to engage the Senate's Aid: The Eloquence of Pompey had Success: This generous Deed! (O dreadful, piteous Thought!) Was the last Product of their fading Friendship. But CÃ¦sar stopt not there! the Senate's Aid Was but a publick Act; his opening Heart Pour'd out his private Treasure with his Love, And from the Bounty of that secret Flame, We reap'd the Profit of suppress'd Rebellion. My conscious Father, on this Truth reflecting, Thought half at least was due, to her that sav'd The whole, and therefore at his Death bequeath'd Me equal Sway, Coheiress of his Throne: While you, unknowing of his noble Motive, Reproach his Memory with partial Care, And make my Right, by Force of Arms, your Spoil. Ptol. How plausible soe'er this Tale may seem, Yet Madam, in my Sense, it ill agrees With CÃ¦sar's Love, and your Concern for Pompey. Cleo. Of that, be CÃ¦sar Judge. To you at least It proves, that I prefer my Fame to Empire. But since your Tutors, Sir, have humbler Views, Pursue the Ruin I have warn'd you of. Send your Assassins forth, on CÃ¦sar's Foes, And buy his Friendship with an Act of Horror! While for the Pity I avow for Pompey, On me, fall all the Bolts of CÃ¦sar's Rage! Boast you your Merit, and of me complain, Then see, from what great CÃ¦sar shall ordain, Which most deserves, the King or Queen, to reign. [Exit. Ptol. Was ever form'd so fierce, untam'd a Spirit? Phot. Confusion and Amazement seize my Sense! It must be Fiction all! is she not Woman? Her Spleen has forg'd this Secret: for if true, How cou'd her Sex's Pride so long conceal it? Ptol. And yetâwhat Profit cou'd the Fiction yield? Phot. That answers all! it has Foundation! 'Tis well we've Time to arm against her Power. Ptol. Suppose the Fate of Pompey were deferr'd? Phot. If that were Merit, it will now be hers! Nor cou'd your Crown be sure, from her Reward! Ambition is the only Power, that combats Love. And since, howe'er we are dazzled with his Virtue, Pompey's sure Death is CÃ¦sar's warmer Wish; With Pompey's Head, we must supplant her Beauty Ptol. It mustâNecessity will have it so! Or Pompey, now, or Ãgypt is no more: My Kingdom, like a Bark distress'd at Sea, Must, in the common Danger, know no Right, Value, or Property, in cumbrous Treasure. But when the Freight destroy'd a People saves, We undistinguish'd plunge it in the Waves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. âVictoribus ipsis Dedecus, &amp; nunquam superum caritura pudore Fabula.â Lucan. lib. 8. Cleopatra, Charmion; and Photinus meeting them. Cleopatra. Since when, was this Enlargement of your Power? To seize a Slave, you knew employ'd by me? Have you your Master's Order, for this Treatment? Phot. I need no special Order for my Duty: What I have done, I'll answer to the King: In Times of Danger, Safety is our Law: Were Treasons only to be crush'd in Form; Traytors wou'd soon defy their Punishment. Cleo. Traytors! Phot. Madam, I call that Slave a Traytor, That durst betray the Counsels of his Prince! I knew you restless, in the Cause of Pompey, And therefore had my Eye upon your Conduct. I knew, if Pompey had Advice to fly, You only durst attempt to give it him: This Letter intercepted, proves my Fears Were justly grounded: CÃ¦sar and the King Will judge, by this, how much you serve their Int'rests. Cleo. I tell thee, Slave, if thou art judg'd by CÃ¦sar, Thy Head stands forfeit to thy Insolenceâ Phot. CÃ¦sar admits no female Counsellors. Cleo. Dares then thy scurril Tongueâavoid my Presence [Exit Phot. Char. Excuse a Heart concern'd for your Repose. But since depriv'd of Power t'avenge your Wrongs, Why shou'd your vain Resentment urge your Foes, To offer more? This Scorn you shew Photinus, Who, at his Pleasure, sways the ductile King, Will but incense him to abuse that Influence, And add by fresher Insults to his Triumph. Cleo. I mock the short-liv'd Power, that dares insult me! For know, my Charmion, CÃ¦sar's on our Coasts! Spite of their Spies, and Vigilance of State; From his own Hand, this Morn have I receiv'd Advice, he brings his Legions into Ãgypt! That his indulgent Stars, by Pompey's Flight, Now lead him, where his first Ambition calls, To crown his Conquests, by a Wreath from me. I weigh not, whether true, or feign'd his Flame; Me it suffices, 'tis the Style of Love. Make him, ye Gods! but capable of Passion, And leave the forming of his Heart to me! Char. Still more amazing! can you ever hope, That CÃ¦sar will be won, by your Defiance? Your open and avow'd Concern for Pompey! Which now this Letter, will, produc'd, confirm. Will CÃ¦sar make a Mistress of his Foe? Of one that wou'd arm Ãgypt to oppose him, And, by the Aid of Pompey, blast his Lawrels? Cleo. Alas, my Charmion, thou'rt unskill'd in Heroes! Love there is born, but from superior Virtue! Think'st thou, a CÃ¦sar's Soul can e'er be mov'd, But by a Heart, ambitious as his own? As jealous, as tenacious of its Glory? Shou'd I, to serve his Interests, injure Pompey; His Sword might spare, but Honour wou'd despise me. No! to deserve him, he shall find me grateful. My just Concern for Pompey, though his Foe, Demands his Admiration, not Resentment. Soon is the Lover lost, we fear to lose; But while, for Pompey's Sake, I brave that Danger, CÃ¦sar will envy, what a lower Mind Wou'd hate. But see, the holy Priest returns; I sent him to enquire of Pompey's Doom. Enter Achoreus. O speak Achoreus, what thy Looks presage! How have the Gods dispos'd of hapless Pompey? Acho. O! that my Age had never seen this Day! Or that Pharsalia's Field had left no Blood In CÃ¦sar's Foes, to stain the Shores of Ãgypt? Cleo. Give me the whole, and blend my Tears with thine. Acho. Hear then the Fate of Pompey, and deplore! When, from his Ships, he saw the spacious Beach Cover'd with gazing Crowds, and at their Front, Our shining Troops, in stately Order rang'd; The martial Musick sounding from our Gallies, With gaudy Streamers making from the Port; His quickning Eye confest a new-born Joy! Concluding that our grateful King design'd, In Person, and with Honours, to receive him. But when, at length, he found but one poor Boat Sent forth, fill'd only with a chosen Guard; And those without the King, to grace his Welcome; His Fate he saw, yet wou'd not seem to see; Silent he stood, with Eyes resign'd, and dauntless; Or anxious only for Cornelia's Fears; Turning to whom, in Care-concealing Smiles, âCompose thy Heart, he cry'd; my self alone âWill tempt the doubtful Gratitude of Ãgypt; âWhere, if I fall, thy Flight may yet revenge me: âIn Africk, still, our firm Allies make Head, âThy Father, and my Sons, enforc'd by Juba: âThere will thy Fortunes find a kinder Welcome! âOr if the Gods refuse their Arms Success, âCato will own our Cause, tho' Gods forsake it. Cleo. O! thou hast giv'n Cornelia's Pangs to me! Acho. During this Conflict of their mighty Hearts, The Skiff, that bore the bloody Crew, drew near; From whence, Septimius, to disguise their Purpose, I'th'Roman Language hail'd him Emperor. âDescend, great Sir, he cry'd; this shallow Bark âAvoids the Sands, that barr our larger Vessels; âThis Sir, secure will waft you to the King, âWho waits impatient on the Beach t'embrace you. The destin'd Hero, of this vile Abuse Tho' conscious, saw, 'twas now no Time to parley. When taking, from his Friends, and mournful Wife, A short Farewel; with that majestick Air, Went forward to his Fate, as when the Carr Triumphant bore him through the Streets of Rome. Cleo. Were there no Friends attended him to Shore? Acho. But oneâthe Bark too narrow for his Train, His Freed-man Philip only follow'd him. Of what I speak, by him was I inform'd, The faithful Witness of his FateâAt length, The Crew, secure of their deluded Prey, Now change their Looks, and sullen ply their Oars; As if some Criminal condemn'd they bore; Nor on the Way vouchsafe his Cares a Word. Observing this, he drew his Tablets forth, Perusing there some Notes of an Oration, Which for his Royal Audience he had form'd: Anon, o'er-charg'd with Sighs, he turn'd his Eyes, Throwing a last long Look to sad Cornelia. Then to himself, or but to Philip's Ear, From Sophocles, this Fragment he repeated: âThe Great and Free, when Fugitives, are Slaves, âAnd where they seek Protection, find their Graves. O spare the rest. Cleo. Proceed! my Eyes are full. Acho. The Shore now gain'd, they warn him to disbark. And while, to raise him, Philip reach'd his Arm, Achillas, from behind, the bloody Signal gave; At which, Septimius, with his Ruffian Romans, Bury'd at once their Daggers in his Breast! At their repeated Blows, one deep Groan he gave, When covering with his Robe his closing Eyes, At his Assassines Feet, the Greatâthe Murther'd Pompey fell. Cleo. Ye Gods! who give up Nations to the Sword, When this flagitious Deed your Bolts shall punish, Charge not the Place, but Persons, with the Crime! The Blood of Pompey was by Romans shed! Let o'er Ãgyptian Roofs your Vengeance pass, And hurl your Thunder on the Towers of Rome. Acho. Nor ends, in Death, th'unhospitable Deed: Living, and dead, is Pompey still mis-us'd! His Head, by fierce Septimius, from the Neck Divided, on Achillas' Spear is born, In Triumph thro' the Crowd, to Ptolomey; As if some Captive Pyrate they had slain, Or, as their braver Swords had conquer'd Pompey! His mangled Corps committed to the Waves, Like a wreckt Vessel bulges on the Sands, And stains, with crimson Infamy, our Shores; While, at the dreadful Sight, Cornelia's Cries Ev'n to the Beach are heard, and pierce the Heav'ns in vain. Cleo. Heart-breaking Woe! what Virtue can support it! Acho. What Fate attends her, to the Gods is known. For on the Instant we perceiv'd her Sails Unfurl'd, and making to the Seas for Flight. On which, Septimius, to compleat his Crime, With six large Vessels labours her Pursuit. Cleo. Arise ye sudden Shades of Night! black Storms, Or kinder Tempests, shield her from his Power. Acho. And now our Troops retreating to the Palace, In solemn March precede the trunkless Head, On which the shudd'ring Crowd with Horror gaze: Some hear it thunder! these an Earthquake feel! Dreading the Wreck of Nature for the Crime! The faithful Philip, tho' o'er-whelm'd with Grief, Bears, from the Waves, his Master's sad Remains, And tho' a mean, a pious funeral Pile, And for his Ashes, a poor Urn prepares. Cleo. Which conqu'ring CÃ¦sar might behold with Tears. Acho. Confirm the Omen, Isis, for he comes! These Winds that blow, shall waft him to our Shores. Cleo. What means thy Transport? ought of CÃ¦sar? say, And dissipate the Sadness thou hast rais'd. Acho. While pensive on Cornelia's Flight we gaze, From Ear to Ear, a joyous Murmur flies, Bursting anon to Shouts! Lo! CÃ¦sar comes! At this all Eyes are turn'd to seize the Sight! When from behind the swelling Ocean's Hill, Behold, a naval City climbing to the View; Their Sails, all gilded by the glaring Sun, Confound the Curious, that would count their Numbers. Cleo. It is! it must! it can be only He! Tremble, ye Tyrants, for your impious Power! The Gods are just, and send their CÃ¦sar's Arms, T'avenge the Injured, on the guilty Head! Acho. Behold the King! Incens'd he seems! Perhaps The Sight of me offends! for since my Voice Declar'd for Pompey, I have lost his Smiles: Permit me, gracious Madam, to retire. [Exit. Enter Ptolomey. Ptol. Achillas! yet a Moment stay the Guard! First will I prove, if she avow the Treason. Madam, my Converse with you now is short! Examine well this Character. Cleo. 'Tis mine. Ptol. 'Tis wellânow say that you were Ptolomey, And I your Captive had betray'd your Counsels, What Treatment had this Treason merited? Cleo. Had I been King, that Treason had been Counsel, And to the Blood of Pompey, CÃ¦sar's Hate Preferr'd. Ptol. Your own Confession has condemn'd you, And CÃ¦sar shall himself approve my Justice. Cleo. Must that then prove me criminal to CÃ¦sar? Ptol. The Proof is fair, as is the Fact notorious! Was not th'Attempt to save the Foe of CÃ¦sar, And keep his Title to the World disputed? Cleo. You speak, as if my Crimes, like yours, were writ In Blood. Once more, I warn you of your Fate, Provoke not CÃ¦sar, by new Wrongs to me. Ptol. Fear not, your Conduct shall have all its Merit! CÃ¦sar shall know the Charms you use t'engage him, Shall fairly see his Friends, from Enemies. Achillas, ho! Enter Achillas with Guards. Obey your Orders! Madam, Your own Apartment bounds your Liberty. Cleo. Me to restrain, there needed not your Guards; Tho' CÃ¦sar's at our Gates, I shou'd not, Sir, Have flown to meet him: no, my Sex's Pride Had been a Bar sufficient, for your Fears: Yet for your own Sake, name not my Confinement, No! rather, let him think my Absence, Choice. Tho' of my Crown depriv'd, the World shall see I guard its Honour, in Captivity. While you, to CÃ¦sar's Feet, your Scepter bear, He'll know the Queen expects his Homage here. And while his Frown your proffer'd Crown disdains, A Smileâshall lead this Master of the World in Chains. [Exit with Guards. Enter Photinus. Phot. Some Officers, Express, from CÃ¦sar's Fleet, (His fam'd Lieutenants, Antony and Decius,) Intreat immediate Audience. Ptol. Give them Entrance. Enter Antony, Decius, and Guards. Dec. From the great Julius, Health to Ptolomey. Ptol. Permit me, Romans, to embrace the Heroes, That grace our Ãgypt, with Commands from CÃ¦sar. Ant. My separate Duty, Sir, attends the Queen In private Audienceâyet I see her not! The fair Co-Regent! your Colleague in Power! Ptol. Let me, with Grief, impeach a Sister's Virtue! But Sir, her Actions ill deserve that Title: Her Claim to Empire, as a Foe to CÃ¦sar, Stands forfeit to his Mercy, and the State. And therefore are these Palace Walls her Prison. Ant. I come not, Sir, to hear her Crimes recounted; Of those our General himself will judge! To him your Accusation must appeal. My plain Commission asks a personal Audience; Which CÃ¦sar's Will, by me, once more demands. Ptol. The Will of CÃ¦sar be obey'dâPhotinus, Let Antony have Audience of the Queen. [Exe. Ant. and Phot. Now Sir, CÃ¦sar's Commands to Ptolomey? Dec. Short is my Message, and from CÃ¦sar, thus. To know if Royal Ptolomey is leagu'd In Arms with Pompey, or adheres to CÃ¦sar! If CÃ¦sar is oppos'd, he knows his Course, 'Tis forward, thro' your Walls, with wasteful War: But if your due Submission owns his Power, His Veterans, like jocund Hinds from Labour, Shall pour, this Instant, on your Shores, To greet as Friends, and give your Crown Protection. Thus says the Roman ImperatorâNow Sir, Our Signal to his Fleet, attends your Answer. Ptol. Thus then, to mighty CÃ¦sar, Ptolomey: Tho' Ãgypt long has been to Rome a Province, Yet since Pharsalia gives to Rome a Master, Who but that Master can demand our Homage? Pass then the Arms of CÃ¦sar thro' our Gates. And, Sir, to ratify our firm Adherence, To bury ev'n Suspicion of Resistance, This Instant shall our private Troops retire, And Southward from the City form their Camp, 'Till CÃ¦sar's Service, or his Will, recall them. Dec. CÃ¦sar shall know the Speed of your Compliance: But how, Sir, has your Power dispos'd of Pompey? Ptol. As Heav'n had mark'd him, for the Foe of CÃ¦sar, Whose Cause the Gods so gloriously have own'd: And as the Sword, in Pompey's Hand, but serv'd To make the Streams of Roman Blood perpetual; Our Councils have disarm'd, and seiz'd on Pompey; To grace th'Arrival of victorious CÃ¦sar. Dec. A Prince so young, and careful for his State, Merits as well our Wonder, as Protection. Ptol. My Merit is my Zeal, for CÃ¦sar's Glory. Dec. Haste Quintius! from the Northern Tower, let fly The Eagle, Signal of our Amity. How will the Heart of Godlike CÃ¦sar glow, Folding his Arms around the vanquish'd Pompey! [Apart and Exit. Ptol. These Romans, who contemn the Thrones of Kings, By this their Insolence to Majesty, Betray the Rancour of their vain Ambition. 'Tis not the King they hate, but Kingly Right. They scorn our Crowns, from want of Birth to wear them: There's what recoils against their secret Wishes, And turns desponding Envy, into Virtue. Enter Photinus. Now Photinus, the News from Antony? Phot. What greatly will surprize, and may preserve you. Ptol. Hast thou, from his Audience, ought collected? Phot. Nothing from Words: for I was warn'd aloof. But if my Eyes are faithful, yet enough To knowâwhate'er might be his Charge from CÃ¦sar, The secret Errand of his Heart was Love. Ptol. Thou tell'st me Wonders! what grounds th'Assertion? Phot. Whether at Rome, or here, he caught the Flame, I know not; but his Gesture, his Approaches, Spoke more Respect, than Romans pay to Crowns! His Looks, his heaving Bosom, his Confusion, Confest a Soul surpriz'd, astonish'd, and subdu'd! She, conscious of the Wounds her Form had given, With all the Blandishments of glancing Beauty, With softning Smiles, indulgent to Desire, Unloos'd her Charms, to make the Conquest sure. Anon, to strike him with her various Darts, When, to his Speech, her seeming Woes reply'd, A stealing Shower of Tears roll'd down her Cheeks, Like Dew-drops trickling o'er the Bloom of Roses. When turning to disguise the Grief, her Eyes Encountring my Observance, I retir'd. Not chusing, while I heard not, to offend her. Ptol. Cou'd you not guess the Occasion of her Tears? Phot. I judg'd them artful, to precede her Story, To heighten her Distresses, for Compassion. Ptol. If Antony shou'd love, Love may befriend Her Cause to CÃ¦sar. Phot. Or may ruin it. Think you, proud CÃ¦sar's Heart will brook a Rival? Here's Ground at least to give him Jealousy. If it succeeds, her boasted Empire ceases! CÃ¦sar will never be the Slave of Beauty, Tamely to court, and kiss the Chain that galls him: No Sir, her Truth suspected, sets him free: Or to be more the Hero, his Contempt May give her as a Slave to Antony, Whose humbler Heart may think the Donor bounteous. Ptol. Confusion! how she plays her Sex's Wiles! The whole Artillery of Love to thwart me! Her Eyes wou'd lift his Legions in her Cause, And be the Mistress of Mankind, for Empire. [A loud Shout. Phot. But hark! these Acclamations from the Port Speak CÃ¦sar near our Shore. Ptol. Haste then to greet him. Some fitter Time shall weigh this Secret.âList! [Trumpets. Again the Signal Trumpet, from our Gallies, Calls us to meet this Master of the World! His Pow'r must judge this Prize, for Empire play'd, Betwixt the Monarch, and ambitious Maid; But if Ambition be his fiercer Flame, The Head of Pompey shall out-blaze the Dame. [Exeunt. SCENE opens to the Port of Alexandria. Enter on one Side Ptolomey wearing his Crown, with Photinus and Attendants. From the upper End, the Roman Lictors and Officers with their Fasces and military Ensigns, &amp;c. While they range themselves on each Side the Scene, Shouts and Trumpets are heard. After which CÃ¦sar advances, and Ptolomey kneeling addresses him. Ptol. Lord of Mankind! Imperial Julius, hail! Lo! at thy Feet, as to the First of Men, In awful Homage, bows thy prostrate Ãgypt: The Sun, and CÃ¦sar, now, have equal Empire: Far as his Beams extend, CÃ¦sar has conquer'd! Nor, to the teeming Banks of Nile more wisht His genial Heat, than Julius, to our Shores! What Kings are safe, that dare oppose his Glory? What People free, whom CÃ¦sar's Arms protect not? Take then this happier Province to thy Care, While thus her tributary Prince resigns His Crown, to be adorn'd by CÃ¦sar's Brow. [Presenting it to CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. Arise, young Prince, not let thy Transport loose thee. Wou'dst thou appear the King, retain thy Crown; The Lawrel better suits the Brow of Julius! Crowns are the Trophies of tyrannick Sway. Romans may conquer, but disdain to wear 'em. Ptol. Ye Gods! what yet unheard-of Virtues have You form'd, that only Roman Souls can reach? CÃ¦s. Call it not Virtue, to resist what tempts not. What Heirs from Heirs receive, blind Fortune gives, Where Birth prefers the Infant to the Man! While heretable Crowns entail not Virtue, The Boast were greater to bestow, than wear them. But whence has Ptolomey this single Power Of vast Mnuificence, where Equal Right Might claim an equal Merit, from the Bounty? Beware, no private Wrong to Cleopatra, Prompt thee to offer up a Power usurpt, Lest Beauty shou'd prevail, on Power superior, To right her Sufferings, with the sole Dominion. Ptol. If CÃ¦sar's Enemies deserve to reign, None stand before the Claim of Cleopatra. If on her Will the Fate of Rome had rested, Pharsalia's Field had given the Palm to Pompey. CÃ¦s. Were your fair Sister, Prince, the Foe you speak her, Her Spirit wou'd, in Person, have declar'd her. Ptol. But if great CÃ¦sar's Foes deserve their Chains, Then gentle are the Bonds of Cleopatra. CÃ¦s. Let me conceive you, Sir; at once, be plain. Ptol. What I have urg'd, then plainly this confirms. [Presents Cleopatra's Letter to him, who seems to peruse it. Had not our Vigilance cut short that Notice, Pompey, forewarn'd, had now revers'd his Fate; Had headed Troops in Parthia, or in Africk, Might still have vainly rais'd the Dust of War, To choak the Pass of CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. Ha! revers'd! Something tremendous must have caus'd this Notice. Phot. Take Comfort, Sir, he staggers at the Proof. [To Ptol. CÃ¦s. Nor can I think her yet the Foe of CÃ¦sar! The State of Pompey will resolve the Doubt. [Apart. Produce then Pompey, to condemn the Queen. Ptol. Let CÃ¦sar be obey'dâAchillas, ho! [To Achillas, who is suppos'd at some Distance. Open the gazing Throng, and to our View, Advanc'd in Air, upon thy Javelin's Point, Present our Evidence of Faith to CÃ¦sar. [CÃ¦sar turning to the Entrance, starts. CÃ¦s. Stupendous Vision! have my Eyes their Function! Some God awake me from this frightful Dream, Or raise the living Pompey to the Field, That I may meet him, there, less terrible! Hence! from my View! remove the ghastly Form! Nor give weak Nature these resistless Pangs. Pharsalia now has drawn the Tears of CÃ¦sar. Ptol. Photinus! oh! the Storm is rising! save me! [Aside to Pho. Dec. How has young Ptolomey with Words deceiv'd me? Was this the Seizure he had made of Pompey? CÃ¦s. Ev'n in the Field, that Sight were mournful; But here, where Benefits rely'd on Safety, Where Obligations fenc'd him from Suspicion, To trample down the Mounds of Gratitude, Inhospitably steel'd, and deaf to Honour, To strike the Life, to whom your Crown was due, Sets universal Nature in Alarm, And warms his Foes, even CÃ¦sar, to avenge him. Ptol. CÃ¦sar! I grant the Deed, that thus offends theeâ CÃ¦s. The Deed! Immortal Pow'rs! is there a Crime Beneath the Roof of Heav'n, that stains the Soul Of Man, with more infernal Hue, than damn'd Assassination? O my curdling Blood! When-e'er the Image strikes upon my Brain, Involuntary Horrors shake my Frame, And mock the Force of Intrepidity. [Ptolomey offers to speak. No more! Impartial Justice wou'd be calm, Nor shall unheard condemn: when CÃ¦sar is Himself, his Patience shall endure to hear thee. Dec. If Virtue, or if Honour might be Judge, CÃ¦sar was never more himself than now. [Apart. O Pompey, now might thy hard Fate be envy'd! If thy great Spirit hovers yet in Air, Look down, and triumph, in the Grief of CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. Reflection has, at length, made way for Judgment; Now urge thy Motives for the Fate of Pompey. Ptol. What Words can save, what CÃ¦sar's Frown condemns? If what is done to serve him, can be Wrong, Why strike his Arms such Terror thro' the World, That not to serve him, seems the greater Crime? Where Fear prevails, what Conduct can be blameless? Will CÃ¦sar then resent a Passion, which Himself excites? Involuntary Crimes? Will he oblige the Blind to see, the Deaf To hear, or the disorder'd Brain to reason? Must Nature change her Course, to act his Will? The Wretch that fears to drown, will break thro' Flames, Or, in his Dread of Flames, will plunge in Waves. When Eagles are in View, the screaming Daws Will cowre beneath the Feet of Man, for Safety! Not Folly is more ignorant than Fear! If Fear be Guilt, 'twere Guilt to give us Fear; Then let the Dread of seeming CÃ¦sar's Foe Answer, to CÃ¦sar's Arms, for Pompey's Fate. My Life! my Crown, are equal in thy Power! If CÃ¦sar for an Enemy cou'd weep, What kind of Pity must invade his Eye, When a mistaken Friend endures his Vengeance? CÃ¦s. If CÃ¦sar can deplore an injur'd Foe, Can he, who boasts the Wrong, expect his Friendship? Or vainly shall his Friend presume, the Crime Will, at the Cost of CÃ¦sar's Fame, be pardon'd? But Friend's a Name, I've not yet chose for thee: 'Twas what my Heart had still reserv'd for Pompey. False and destructive is thy Zeal for CÃ¦sar! T'have sav'd that Life, had giv'n Mankind Repose, And made Pharsalia glorious! Tow'ring Thought! With what transporting Joy, the harrass'd World, Had, in one peaceful, publick Chariot seen Pompey, and CÃ¦sar, o'er their Jars triumphant! That forward Fruit, that Harvest of my Arms, Thy curst, officious, wasteful Hand has ruin'd! To pass the Crime, how might the World arraign me! How might the partial Senate justify The Rage, with which their Votes pursu'd me? Ptol. Were I but CÃ¦sar's Foe, I might have Mercy. CÃ¦s. Yet, let me not, to sooth my Enemies, Swerve from the Laws of conscious Clemency; How black and horrible soe'er the Deed, 'Tis not the Fact, but Will, creates the Crime. [Apart. Thy Youth and Inexperience, Prince, arrest My Arm, and turn the Eye of Vengeance On elder Criminals, thy Flatterers. If thou wou'dst prove thy Penitence sincere, Give up thy Counsellors to instant Justice, As due Oblations to the Shade of Pompey. Phot. 'Tis well! the War's begun! CÃ¦sar, thy Heart May yet repent this Arrogance of Power. [Apart. CÃ¦s. And since the Burden of Imperial Rule Out-weighs thy Strength, call to thy present Aid Thy Sister's Right, to share and grace thy Throne Had she been heard, what Glory hadst thou gain'd: What Shame, what Ills, what Infamy avoided! If possible, repair thy Loss; but haste! Think that each Moment, 'till her Right's restor'd, But swells thy Debt of Royalty usurp'd. [Exe. Ptol. Phot. and Ãgyptians. O Decius! was there ever Day like this? How sudden are the Blows of Fate! what Change, What Revolution, in the State of Glory? Dec. Glory and Empire ever will have Heirs. What Pompey once possess'd, is now enjoy'd By CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. Yet the Senate own'd his Cause; Which gave it, to the World, the Stamp of Virtue: There his Ambition got the Start of CÃ¦sar. Dec. Virtue, like Gold, will take the Stamp from Power. Yet Truth must own, in what has pass'd this Day, Had Cato's self been Witness of your Conduct, He must with Praise, or Envy, have beheld it. CÃ¦s. Cato wou'd term it but a specious Bribe For Power: That Pompey's Blood was, in regard To Rome, reveng'd, to court her Senate's Favour: That Cleopatra's Beauty, not her Cause, Regain'd her Crown: Yet Cato has his Merits: And Men, one Day, may change their Thoughts of CÃ¦sar. The Time may come, when his destructive Arms Shall well repay this Ravage of the World, And force them, by Obedience, to be happy So when the swelling Nile contemns her Bounds, And with extended Waste, the Valleys drowns, At length her ebbing Streams resign the Field, And, to the pregnant Soil, a ten-fold Harvest yield.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Effossum tumulis cupidÃ¨ descendit in antrum, Illic PellÃ¦i proles vesana Philipi FÃ¦lix prÃ¦do jacet, terrarum vindice fata Raptus.â Lucan. lib. 10. SCENE Before the Tomb of Alexander. CÃSAR, DECIUS, ACHOREUS. CÃ¦sar. Decius, dismiss the Train; yet guard the Portal. Observe the strictest Order, in our Watch: These Sons of Nile are faithless, servile, dangerous! The Fate of Pompey warns us to be wary. When Anthony returns, here let him find me. [Exit Decius. Believe me, good Achoreus, thy Disgrace Commends thee to the Breast of CÃ¦sar: Here, Thy Virtue seems a greater Prodigy, Than all the Brood, or Monuments of Ãgypt. Thy just Humanity, thy Zeal for Pompey, Became thy venerable Years, thy Function. When Holy Guides, neglect themselves, for Heav'n, Nor fear to advance their Precepts, by Example, 'Tis then the Gods are righteously rever'd. Acho. CÃ¦sar, thy Virtues, Knowledge, and thy Power, Incite me now to bolder Acts of Duty: And since I find not, in thy calmer Soul, That fierce, untractable, remorseless Nature, Wherewith thy Enemies asperse thy Fame, Let not my zealous Grief offend thee, CÃ¦sar, If I confess, I sigh for thy Ambition! CÃ¦s. Where it opposes Virtue, charge me freely! Be bold! If I am justify'd to one Good Man, the Millions I offend are Railers. Virtue, like the Sun, shines not for Applause. Acho. Ambition was my Charge! which when it climbs O'er violated Laws, tramples on Virtue: Yet of the narrow Mountain when possess'd, The Footing how unsure! the Fall how dreadful! Perhaps by Treason! Treason has Ambition! Or say thou wert secure, how vain the Glory! To stand in Clouds, on Eminence, alone! And view thy happier social Slaves beneath thee. Even then must thou descend! CÃ¦sar, behold, Fix on this mouldring Monument thy Eyes; Amidst the Wonders that our Nile can boast, This best might suit Ambition's Meditation! Of all the spacious Earth his Sword subdu'd, Great Alexander, now, Commands but this. CÃ¦s. Soft, Achoreus! lies Alexander here? Acho. Here rest his Bones! his Bounds of Empire, now. CÃ¦s. Here might, indeed, the Moralist declaim. Acho. Here, when his ruthless Desolation ceas'd, When his tumultuous Soul cou'd waste no more, Himself receiv'd, and gave his Slaves, Repose. CÃ¦s. Thus, when the awful Gods wou'd scourge, or bless Mankind, they give unbounded Power to One. The Vice, or Virtues, of the Prince, create Their Woes, or Happiness. Acho. Wou'dst thou from hence Infer, that Rome's Obedience to thy Sway Might make her, with the Loss of Freedom, happy? Even Benefits, Impos'd, are gentler Chains: Or say the Yoke of CÃ¦sar might sit Easy? Yet, who shall hold the Reins, when CÃ¦sar is no more? Perhaps, a Tarquin, or a Ptolomey! A Prince of savage, or too ductile Nature. Why, then, O CÃ¦sar! this discordant Rage? Why is Imperial Rome, that sway'd the Earth, Her self at Variance with Prosperity? Why wage thy Veterans War, without a Foe? Why are her Sires by Sons, Brothers by Brothers slain? As mutual Murther were the publick Welfare. But, CÃ¦sar, I am bold; pardon these Tears! Think that Benevolence deplores, not Envy chides thee. CÃ¦s. What thou hast urg'd, Achoreus, heaves my Heart! CÃ¦sar forgets not Nature, tho' Victorious: I grieve to think the Innocent involv'd In Ruins, which the Guilty have deserv'd! Had Rome her ancient Virtue, with her Power, CÃ¦sar had trembled at her Civil Wars: But Luxury, Corruption, Vice, and Fraud Have drain'd her down, ev'n to the Lees of Rome. Her Honours, now, by publick Price are bought; Her Magistrates, by Blows, not Votes, elected: Thus is the Carcass of her Freedom torn By Beasts of Prey, each scrambling for his Share. Where Men are Wolves, what Wretch wou'd be the Lamb? Where Laws are violated, Arms are Virtue. Acho. Is CÃ¦sar arm'd to Guard her Laws? CÃ¦s. Be Patient. Pompey, in War, was Great; CÃ¦sar, Successful: We fought, 'till Rome was glutted with our Spoils; 'Till she grew Jealous of the Swords that serv'd her. While I was absent, Pompey's Arts prevail'd; He wrought the Senate to a partial Vote, That CÃ¦sar from his Charge shou'd be recall'd, And glorious Pompey in his Pow'rs confirm'd. And to give greater Luster to his Honours, They rob'd my Conquests of their due Demands; Nor Triumph, nor a Province, was assign'd me. Acho. Rome to her Generals ever had been grateful. This look'd, indeed, as if she fear'd her Pompey. CÃ¦s. On this, I paus'd:âAnd, to assert my Right, By their own Tribunes sent my Grievances, With gentle Terms of Peace, and due Submission: Their haughty Consuls, in Contempt of CÃ¦sar, And of those Laws that make the Tribunes Sacred, Drove them with Violence from out the Senate; And, at the Hazard of their Lives, from Rome: Then call'd forth Pompey to oppose me. Him, Because she fear'd, Rome chose her General; And Her, because I knew not Fear, my Arms Defy'd.âI pass'd the Rubicon,âShe trembled! Pharsalia, since, has prov'd which General's Sword Might better have advanc'd her Glory.âCato, 'Tis known, no less oppos'd the Power of Pompey; Or if his Virtues since have join'd his Cause, 'Twas that he thought, since one must be her Master, Rome wou'd have gentler Chains from Pompey's Nature. ThisâCÃ¦sar dares deny; and Time shall prove. If, CÃ¦sar, then, is question'd why his Arms Oppose the Virtues he admits in Cato, Or why he makes them not his Practice? CÃ¦sar Replies,âHe will,âbut will first have Power: When that, like Fate, is uncontestable, Then Cato's Lectures shall give Laws to CÃ¦sar. Acho. CÃ¦sar, the Gods, alone, can read the Heart: Thy Words, 'tis true, confirm me to revere Thy Virtues; Heav'n best knows their secret Motive. On this depend;âthe Merits of thy Cause Will prove, at last, the Measure of thy Fate. CÃ¦s. When Fate shall call him, CÃ¦sar is prepar'd. Enter Decius. Now, my Decius! why wear thy Looks this Sadness? Dec. When Roman Matrons wear the Chains of War, What Roman Bosom but regrets the Triumph? Never did Pompey's Fate, as now, affect me! Pardon then, CÃ¦sar! if my Sighs inform thee, The fair distress'd Cornelia is thy Captive. CÃ¦s. Cornelia! ha! thy Sighs become thee, Decius. Dec. The fell Septimius, who pursu'd her Flight, Demanding, at the Port, immediate Entrance, To lead his boasted Captive on to CÃ¦sar: I thought a Roman Matron's Bonds unfit To grace the Vaunting of a Roman Traytor! And therefore stopp'd his Triumph with a Guard, 'Till CÃ¦sar's further Pleasure might be known. CÃ¦s. CÃ¦sar shall thank thee, Decius! and himself Will make his Pleasure to Septimius known. But haste! conduct us to this Fair Distress. When Roman Virtue is oppress'd by Fate, 'Tis meet the Victor on the Vanquish'd wait. [Exeunt. SCENE An Apartment near the Port. Cornelia bound. Septimius speaking to the Roman Guards. Sept. Why loiters thus your busie Officer? Is this fit Treatment for the Friends of CÃ¦sar? Was't not this Arm, that gave him, at a Blow, The Head, that fam'd Pharsalia cou'd not reach? Must we, that bring him Captives to compleat His Conquest, wait, like Suitors, to present them? Mistaken Decius may repent this Insult! I'll take no Thanks, 'till CÃ¦sar has reveng'd it. Corn. Mistaken Murderer! talk'st thou of Vengeance? For any Treatment, that insults thy Crime? CÃ¦sar, tho' steep'd in Blood, abhors th'Assassin! His Arms, tho' Impious, strike no Coward Blows! Shall Murder claim the Wreaths of Conquest? If CÃ¦sar's Cause provok'd thy Hate to Pompey; Why, like a Soldier, sought'st thou not in Battle, Where arm'd, where Sword to Sword thou might'st have charg'd him? There had his Wounds, at least, confest thee Brave, And CÃ¦sar, then, without a Blush had grac'd thee. But as thou art detestable to Man, 'Tis some Asswagement of Cornelia's Woe, That even the Foes of Pompey must avenge him. Sept. Enjoy thy empty Notions of Dishonour! Decisive Blows, in spight of Railers, have Their Merit. CÃ¦sar knows the Use of Valour: And, for great Actions, must have Hands intrepid. Corn. Why did I waste my Breath on Infamy! But frantick Sorrow to the Winds will talk! [Apart. Enter CÃ¦sar, Decius, and Attendants. Sept. Most mighty CÃ¦sar! ere my Tongue presumesâ CÃ¦s. CÃ¦sar disdains to hearâthy Deeds have spoke thee! Decius, disarm! and see him closely guarded, 'Till injur'd Dignity pronounce his Doom! Cornelia's Bonds deform the Pride of War! These are not Roman, but Ãgyptian Fetters. The Virtuous never wear the Chains of CÃ¦sar. [CÃ¦sar releases her. Septimius is bound and led off. Corn. O CÃ¦sar! had'st thou conquer'd thus for Rome, How greatly might this Grace of Power become thee! But while thy Sword is drawn against her Laws; O'er every Roman, whom thy Arms distress, Such specious Comfort is injurious Insult! Cornelia cannot thank thee, for her Woes! If by some publick Crime I have deserv'd them, Whence then this Pity? If I'm Innocent, Let CÃ¦sar name the Power, that dares t'inflict them? CÃ¦s. When civil Discords to the Sword appeal, From whatsoever Part the Wrong commences, Neither can boast of Innocence in War! Corn. Give up thy own, but spare the Fame of Pompey! What Senate own'd thy Cause? CÃ¦s. What Gods crown'd his? But oh! what Gods, or Senate, cou'd defend The Sword, that brings Cornelia to Affliction? Corn. CÃ¦sar, thou hurt'st me more by this Compassion, Than all thy Terrors, in the Rage of War! Yet boast not, Victor, of thy Sword's Success! Cornelia's Fate has lost the Cause of Rome! My cruel Destiny has fought for thee! To that, a Victim fell my first Lord, Crassus! By that, was Pompey vanquish'd, not by CÃ¦sar! Thou, but the Hand of Fate that follow'd me! But that, th'inevitable Will of Jove, Had long prefix'd my Ruin, to thy Fortune. The Liberty of Rome had scap'd thy Chains, Nor had thy Impious Arms o'er Pompey triumph'd. CÃ¦s. Alas, we talk on too unequal Terms. The gentlest Truth, that justifies my Arms, Wou'd now appear a Triumph o'er Cornelia. Corn. CÃ¦sar, no! so impartial is my Heart, Wert thou but Innocent, my Tears wou'd cease: Had Pompey's Fate been Just, I might have born it! But while we see thy fierce Ambition prosperous, And Pompey's Cause attended with his Blood, Mankind might think, that Heav'n it self were sack'd, That DÃ¦mons had usurp'd immortal Power, Revers'd their Laws, and made Rebellion Virtue. CÃ¦s. Thus Virtue, when mis-led, becomes Injurious! Thou talk'st of CÃ¦sar, as if Rome were blameless! As if her Senate had preserv'd her Free, Nor long since sold her Power to private Hands! While clamorous Guilt, and specious Patriot Zeal, Wou'd cast on CÃ¦sar the Reproach of Tyranny. As if my Wrongs, and Insults, after Service, Were not the Proofs of Pompey's Usurpation: Of his o'er-bearing their dependant Votes, To crush the Fortunes of rejected CÃ¦sar, Whose only Sword cou'd bar his Way to Empire. Corn. Thou dost defame him, CÃ¦sar; he was true, Firm, and devoted to the Laws of Rome. CÃ¦s. O Cornelia! O! 'tis with Sighs I tell thee, Pompey's Ambition shone thro' all his Arts! Even to Contempt of CÃ¦sar, it inflam'd him. Had he receiv'd my Terms of Peace with Candor, These Desolations never had reproach'd us: Each had been Glorious in a private Life; Nor had Cornelia's widow'd Arms deplor'd him. Corn. Provoking, gross Insinuation! Peace! Thou know'st thy Terms were offer'd as a Feint, T'amuse the Senate, and protract thy Sentence. CÃ¦s. That Feint shou'd have been prov'd: had I receded, Then had his ArmsâBut flatt'ring Fame deceiv'd him; 'Twas ev'n his common Boast, if he but stampt His Foot, what Legions, at the Sound, wou'd wait him! Corn. Cou'd it be Boast, to think his Cause might call 'em? CÃ¦s. The Cause of CÃ¦sarâwanted not its Numbers. Corn. When Violence and Rapine sound to Arms, Bankrupts and Prodigals are warm for War. CÃ¦s. 'Tis granted. Pompey's Army was Superior. Corn. Superior far in Virtue, not in Spoilers! His Troops were cumber'd with the Sons of Peace, Men train'd to civil Arts, to Laws, and Science! Whom Place and Plenty had disus'd from Toil; Unskil'd in War, yet, for their Birth-rights, Romans! Souls that disdain'd their Bodies, when enslav'd; And therefore left them, on Pharsalia's Plain, To taint the Air with CÃ¦sar's shameful Glory. CÃ¦s. When CÃ¦sar, like the Senate, shall misuse The Trust the Gods assign, let Gods forsake him. Corn. CÃ¦sar, some say thou hast a human Heart, O'er private Sorrows melting to Compassion. CÃ¦s. I feel Cornelia's Woe, tho' she contemns My Pity. Corn. I retract the Pride: My Heart Is humbled, CÃ¦sar, while the general Woe Thus bends me to thy Feet, with Tears for Rome! Have pity on her Wounds! her Sighs! her Groans! O yet relent! and Conquer with Compassion! Compose the wailing World, and yield us Peace! Thy tender Parent, Rome, is not Obdurate! I know her, by my own remissive Heart! In bare Imagination of the Joy, It melts, forgets its private Grief, nor more With Pompey's Ruin will upbraid thy Glory! O! yet restore her Freedom! yet relieve her! Here end thy Conquests! Conquer CÃ¦sar, now! And, like victorious Sylla, crown'd with Vengeance, Resign that Power, which Gods nor Men cou'd Shake. CÃ¦s. While Earth contains a Roman, that presumes With Means coercive to reduce my Power, All Thoughts of Peace are but inglorious Dreams. Let Julius cease to be, or now be CÃ¦sar! Rome may detest, but cannot taint my Power! What conquer'd Roman is not free to leave me? What Enemy, when Captive, is not pardon'd? What are the Marks of CÃ¦sar's Tyranny? But, O Cornelia! spite of all my Boasts, Thy pale Calamities upbraid Success, And, like a chilling Frost, deface my Laurels! CÃ¦sar, at best, can but revenge thy Pompey! There shall thy Tears yet triumph o'er his Foes, And CÃ¦sar's social Grief revere his Fame. But I detain thy Sorrows from Repose; What Comforts Ãgypt can supply, command: Decius, see thou her State be equal to The Roman Matron's Dignity: her Friends, Her Followers, all receiv'd, like Friends of CÃ¦sar. [CÃ¦sar retiring to the End of the Scene, meets Antony. They seem to talk apart, while Cornelia speaks. Corn. Am I, ye Gods! so fallen! so greatly wretched! That he, who bears unmov'd the Groans of Rome, Can lend a Sigh to lost Cornelia's Woe! Yet dares not She be thankful? Rigid Fate! While CÃ¦sar is the Foe of Rome, what great, What noble Virtues, am I doom'd to hate? [Exit, led by Decius. CÃ¦s. But what, my Marcus, cou'd so long detain thee? Ant. To CÃ¦sar ever has my Heart been open: From thee, there's not a Frailty there conceal'd! Why was I chosen for this fatal Errand? O! I have drank my Ruin, at my Eyes! Deform'd my Faith, betray'd my Truth to CÃ¦sar! From thee, as from a Conqueror, I came, Assur'd of Triumph, but return a Captive! Her tow'ring Charms, at once o'erbore my Soul! I spoke for CÃ¦sar, while I sigh'd for Antony! CÃ¦s. We, Marcus, will be ever Friends! a Friend [Taking his Hand. Outweighs th'Indulgence of a short-liv'd Joy. Prove, that thy Sighs prevail'd upon her Heart, And CÃ¦sar's cancel'd Hope resigns to Antony. Ant. This Bounty, CÃ¦sar, binds me to the Truth. Hope had I none, but what my Weakness form'd. Pleading for thee, I trembled at Success; While her advancing Smiles gave me Despair! When, with thy Conquests, I adorn'd thy Flame, A conscious Pleasure sparkled at her Eyes, Unheedful of the Wretch, that burnt, before her. If Love were criminal, Despair has punish'd it. CÃ¦s. Despair and Love ne'er vex the Soldier long! Or Absence is a sure ReliefâIf not, When CÃ¦sar shall dispose of Provinces, Ãgypt may fall to Antonyâ'till whenâ Ant. May CÃ¦sar's Fortunes lead him to his Wishes. CÃ¦s. Saw you my Orders, to confirm her Crown, Obey'd? Ant. During my Audience, Ptolomey In State approaching, plac'd it on her Brow: On which the Nobles offering to renew Their Homage; âYet a while, defer, She cry'd, âThis doubtful DutyâEre I take my Crown, âFrom CÃ¦sar am I yet to know the Terms âOf wearing it! my Brother boasted to âDeserve it whole: CÃ¦sar perhaps has wrong'd him! Then darting her Disdain around, she pass'd The Croud, and left them to their Dread, astonish'd. What haughty Conflict labours in her Breast, Her private Audience better will unfold. But see, she comes! O CÃ¦sar, guard thy Heart! [Exit. Enter Cleopatra, who having made lowly Reverence to CÃ¦sar, he gently approaches her. CÃ¦s. Fair Wonder of the Nile! this Grace to CÃ¦sar, What Service can deserve, what Toils repay? Cleo. CÃ¦sar, I come to undeceive thy Bounty! A Crown restor'd, which Right, or Innocence, Might claim, reflects its Lustre on the Donor: But let not Cleopatra's Soul, by Fraud, Or vile Concealment of a Truth, receive it; Which might, if known, have undeserv'd the Favour. CÃ¦s. In what can Truth be Cleopatra's Foe? Cleo. By Pompey's Death, the Earth and Seas are CÃ¦sar's. But Cleopatra, had her Power prevail'dâ CÃ¦s. Had sav'd my Rival, to dispute the Title.â Cleo. The Charge is Just. And had not Spies preventedâ CÃ¦s. 'Twas not in Spies, to intercept the Virtue! That still retains its Merit, tho' abortive! Cleo. Then CÃ¦sar is the Hero Fame proclaims him! Now I revere the Grandeur I oppos'd! My Crown, in Homage due to CÃ¦sar, triumphs. CÃ¦s. If Homage shou'd to Dignity be paid, CÃ¦sar might, rightly, kneel to Cleopatra. Her generous Concern, for Pompey's Fate, Without the Interest her Charms might boast, Alone had been assur'd of CÃ¦sar's Service. Cleo. Since CÃ¦sar gives me Choice, that Service, As to the nobler Motive, I ascribe to Virtue. CÃ¦s. Yet Beauty, if she please, may mend her Choice! Let us not rob the Needy, for the Great. Love begs a little! Virtue scorns Reward, Conscious of Duty, she content resigns The Thanks, that Love with transport wou'd receive. Cleo. No, in the Lover, CÃ¦sar wou'd be lost! Love wou'd deplume the Hero, to the Swain, And dress Ambition in a vulgar Merit. CÃ¦s. CÃ¦sar might scorn, like other Men, to Love! But Cleopatra's Charms exalt her Slave, And crown his Servitude, with Dignity. Cleo. This is the Language of our menial Courtiers, Who, when their Hearts are warm, despise our Thrones, And find an Empire on a Cynthia's Bosom: But CÃ¦sar's loftier Views contemn the Frailty. CÃ¦s. A Soul so tow'ring, in a Form so fair, As it might dart Despair to sighing Kings, Gives the rough Roman emulous Desire. Cleo. How wou'd such Softness suit with CÃ¦sar's Laurels? CÃ¦s. Nor Gods, nor Men refuse the Flame of Love! What is Ambition, if not crown'd by Beauty? Can proud Preheminence, or vain Degree, Lift up the Soul, to equal heights of Joy? Can all our Pomp, our Glory, boundless Power! To Punish or Reward, Revenge or Pardon? To right the Injur'd, or restrain th'Oppressor? To call forth Merit, from Obscurity, And give its Rags to gawdy Sloth or Fraud? To chace rebellious Kings? To crown th'Obedient? To give, if possible, the World our Laws, And even compel the Stubborn to be happy? Can all these boasted Attributes of Power, Be, in the Pride of doing well, rewarded? In vain the Course by martial Speed is won, If smiling Venus stands not at the Goal! In vain, has Conquest led me round the Globe, If in the richer Circle of this Zone The Treasure of the Earth illudes my Toil. Cleo. O CÃ¦sar, CÃ¦sar! cease these Flatteries! Nor give my Heart a Prospect of Delight, Which only Latian Beauties can enjoy! Such Transports, there, to Merit might be due; But our Ãgyptian Dames are born too near The glowing Sun, to boast of Roman Lustre! What I might boast, too early Cares deface; And, like an eating Canker, in the Bud, Have broke the slender Promise of a Flower. But were I Mistress of those real Charms, Which CÃ¦sar's lavish Fancy has created, He'd find my Eyes, ambitious as his Arms! My first of Love shou'd bless the first of Men! Gods! how the glorious Image swells my Soul, T'have distant Monarchs crowding to my Court, And, at my Feet, their Suppliant Empires laid! If, far behind the Throng, some dazling Brow, Circled with Lawrel, cast an awful Look; Shone o'er their Heads, and darkned their Pretentions! How wou'd my Transport, thro' the Press, make way, And dart, like Venus, to the Arms of Mars. While Crowns and Scepters catching in my Robe, In vain, shou'd clog the Flight of my Ambition. CÃ¦s. Inchanting Vision! O! the Mars! thou Soul Of Juno, wrapt in Cytherea's Form. Cleo. Forgive these Sallies of a wandring Brain; The fancy'd Being is no more! 'tis lost! For me, the Gods have no such Hero found! Unless my vanquish'd Heartâmight call himâCÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. Be CÃ¦sar, thenâthe Mars, the Gods assign thee! O take me, Goddess, gently to thy Arms! There hide my Heart, and mould it to thy Wishes! By Heav'n! there's Magick in thy softning Eyes! So look'd Idalian Venus on the Swain, When, to her Charms, the golden Prize was giv'n. Cleo. CÃ¦sar, thou grow'st too fast upon my Heart! Spite of my Boast, My vaunting wild Ambition, I retreat, I shrink, and tremble at thy Power! defend me! Spare me! speak! for I cou'd hear thee talk for ever! CÃ¦s. Is this a time for Words! when blazing Charms, Like glittering Swords, in War, provoke the Charge! Come forth, thou fair Defiance, to the Field Of Love, and prove the Prowess of thy Beauty! Hence, to some secret verdant Bower remove, By Art or Nature form'd for blissful Love; There wanton Cupids round thy Couch shall fly, And kindling Flames, for ev'ry Charm supply. There shall, compleat, the Wreaths of CÃ¦sar be, And crown his Conquest of the World in thee!</field>

PTOLOMEY, ACHOREUS. Ptolomey. Talk not of Comfort, to a Wretch forlorn! My Right, my Hopes of Empire have their Period! My haughty Sister, in her Charms triumphant, Now moulds the Heart of CÃ¦sar, to my Ruin! Her Vengeance, like a whirling Eddy, draws Me headlong down, Ingulph'd, to rise no more! While CÃ¦sar's conscious Tyranny enjoys The Fruit of my Ingratitude to Pompey; Yet swells his Fame, with Insults for the Service. Acho. Yet Sir, be calm; Impartially reflect On CÃ¦sar's Conduct: you upbraid him now, That in Resentment he regards his Glory: When was it known he made it not his Idol? To hope his Friendship from the Blood of Pompey, Was mixing Casar in the Herd of Men! But since the awful Gods distinguish him With a superior Sway, to bow Mankind, Beneath their uncontestable Decrees; Think it their Will, and make Obedience Virtue. Ptol. Can I then yield up, to his Rage, my Friends, For due Obedience to their Sovereign's Will? Acho. Cou'd you abandon Pompey! such a Friend! And perish, to protect his Murtherers? Is CÃ¦sar to be gain'd, by farther Errors? Ptol. What Course, in these Extremities, can help me? This CÃ¦sar chafes me, like the hunted Lyon! The more I struggle in the Toil, the more I'm bound, girded, self-tangled, in his Power. Acho. Ev'n, at the worst, Sir, safer are you there, Than in those Hands that led you to the Toil: Might I be heardâ Ptol. O! had I never heard But thee, these Miseries had ne'er befallen; Then CÃ¦sar's Honour had been here my Guard! Nor had the Guilt of Pompey's Blood pursu'd me! O! venerable Sage! yet help thy Prince! Assist me! save me, from this nodding Ruin! And, with thy wholesom Counsels, heal my Heart. Acho. Alas! my Prince, what's left, admits no Choice; Those Counsellors, that shook, must save your Crown! They, or their Master, must be Pompey's Victim! Without a Murmur then, to CÃ¦sar yield them. The Argument they urg'd for Pompey's Fate, Now holds against themselves, Necessity! If there be room for Mercy, may they find it! CÃ¦sar, appris'd that I declar'd for Pompey, Holds me in some degree of Trust and Favour. If then a Punishment, on this side Death, May satisfy their Crime, my self will beg The Mitigation, for my Prince's Honour. Ptol. The Virtues of Achoreus shall redeem it. Acho. See Sir! Photinus, and Achillas, come, With downward Eyes, foreseeing what must fall! Ill it befits Achoreus to insult The Grief, which Virtue warns me not to comfort. Permit me to retireâNow, Sir, exert The King! be faithful to your self, and reign! [Exit. Enter Photinus and Achillas. Ptol. Why am I driv'n to these Indignities? Why yield you not your selves to CÃ¦sar's Mercy? Or, must I send you bound, like Criminals? And come my self, in Evidence against you? If in your Hearts there liv'd that Truth you boast, When you perceiv'd his Rage at Pompey's Fate, Why stept you not undaunted forth, like Men, To claim your Share of Glory, in the Deed? But basely left your Prince deserted, lost, To stand, alone, the Shock of his Reproaches? Achil. If Ptolemy disdains to be himself Our Judge, we scorn to kneel for CÃ¦sar's Mercy. Phot. Nor came we, Sir, to justifie our Errors; The Infirmity of Nature; we confess them; CÃ¦sar's Vain-glory has deceiv'd our Hopes! But if, for Pompey's Fate, our Blood must answer, Our Sovereign's Will, not CÃ¦sar, shall condemn us, Your Victims, Sir, shall be themselves your Priests, And pierce these honest Hearts that fail'd to serve you. Achil. Septimius' Hand has taught us how to die! Ptol. Septimius! ha! Achil. Yes Sir, the Insolence Of CÃ¦sar, like a Roman, he resented! When, to compleat his late Pharsalian Conquest, He brought Cornelia Captive, to his Presence, The Tyrant's Pride disdain'd to give him Audience, And, in the Bonds his Prisoner wore, confin'd him: The Sting of which Disgrace so swell'd his Heart, That the same Dagger he employ'd on Pompey, In his own Breast he plung'd, in scorn of CÃ¦sar. Ptol. Septimius dead! Achil. I saw him, on the Pavement, stiff and breathless. Phot. Now what's this mighty Tyrant's outside Greatness? That storms at your Ingratitude to Pompey; And while he reaps the Profit of your Crime, Yet stiles his Treatment of Septimius, Virtue! That daring Hand, that gave his Pride the World. But all is of a-piece! Not Crowns escape him! The Sov'reign Lord of Ãgypt is his Slave, And, in his sight, must crouch, and lowly bend To watch th'imperious Bidding of his Eye! Must give up all, his Friends, his Empire, Honour, The yet untainted Honours of his Race, A royal Sister's violated Fame, To glut the Riots of his pamper'd Power. Ptol. Said'st thou my Sister!âborn for my Undoing! Phot. This Night, devoted to voluptuous Love, These Paramours, like Deities, have revell'd, In all the Luxuries of sensual Joy! The Scene selected, for their amorous Rites, Is now that Bower, she terms the Paphian Court, Herself the Venus there! the ambient Lake, Which from a thousand gurgling Fountains flows, A stately train of silver Swans surround, Like naval Scouts to guard their Citadel! A signal Streamer, from the Window wav'd, Raises or falls the golden Drawbridge down, To pass or to exclude attendant Slaves, As Solitude incites, or cloys Desire: A-down the distant Vale, in Order rang'd, Silken Pavilions form the Camp of Cupid! Where new Delights for every Sense are stor'd. Their Banquets beggar Ãgypt to supply; As if they meant to waste that World he had conquer'd. Now Bands of mimick Maskers, light-heel'd Gauls, Melodious Virgins, or the warbling Eunuch, Beguile the languid Intervals of Love! To soft enervate Sounds, their Souls dissolve, As Fame and Virtue were the Scorn of Greatness. Ptol. Discordant Thunder drown their Harmony, And forked Lightnings rivet their Embraces! Phot. Methinks I see her, in her am'rous Dalliance, Wanton, and toying with the Fate of Ãgypt. Ptol. Villain! how dar'st thou rack me with these Horrors? Unable to avoid, or to revenge them. Phot. 'Tis therefore to your View, Sir, I present them! To give your Vengeance Choice, on whom to fall! Whether on us, whose Arms wou'd set you free, Or on this wasteful Tyrant, that enslaves you? Ptol. What vaunting Project brooding in thy Brain, To save thy self, wou'd plunge thy Prince in Ruin? Phot. If, Sir, our Lives can your lost Crown retrieve, Take them! and bury, with our Bones, the Secret. Achil. But if our Prince dares urge us to the Proof, These Hands, that have endanger'd, shall preserve him. Ptol. So confident! unfold this Mystery. Phot. The Moment, that I read, in CÃ¦sar's Rage, For Pompey's Death, the lowring Fate of Ãgypt; Conscious, that open Force were vain t'oppose him; I gave Achillas Orders to detain, Conceal'd within our Walls, some chosen Troops, That might, in our Distress, revenge our Chains: CÃ¦sar returns, this Evening, to the Palace: But knows not, that a subterraneous Vault, Beneath this Town, whose Entrance we command, May bring your Vengeance to his Doors, and at A Blowâgive Ãgypt, and the World Repose. Ptol. Now by the injur'd Majesty of Kings! The Vision wakes my Soul! bright Vengeance dawns! O! for a Moment of resistless Ruin, To crush the Head of this enormous Tyrant! Gods! 'twere too much! the Thought o'erbears my Soul! Ev'n Pompey's Head, by CÃ¦sar's, were atton'd, And Rome wou'd owe her Liberty to Ãgypt! Achil. Nay more, the conquer'd World, to Ptolomey! Phot. Howe'er her Senate favour'd Pompey's Arms, Yet his Success had been, as CÃ¦sar's, dreadful! Pompey preserv'd had been her equal Master: But both destroy'd, secures her Friendship, Confirms her Freedom, and your Fame immortal. Ptol. But oh! my Friends, in vain is all this Ardour, Unless our Hopes were sure of Execution! The secret Passage I approve; but while Surrounded by his Guards, how may our Force, Without Alarm, or Chance of his Escape, Approach him? failing of our Blow, we perish. Achil. That, Sir, by Hands who have Access, shall reach him. Some daring Spirits, in Cornelia's Train, Impatient to preserve the Roman Laws, Already have embrac'd our Enterprize. Phot. When next the Tyrant deigns to give them Audience, (Which oft, with Smiles imperious, he allows,) Then sure and sudden shall the Blow be giv'n! When on a Signal, from the dreadful Vault, Bursting like Thunder, shall our Troops rush forth, And e'en defy his guardian Gods to save him. Ptol. O thou hast fir'd my Soul, with vengeful Triumph! Isis! Osiris! Pharian Gods ador'd, Incline this Day propitious to our Vows! How glorious will your sacred Altars blaze, When such a Victim, to your Vengeance bleeds! What Terrors must this Waster of the World Dismay, when from the teeming Earth, Revenge, And meagre Death, impetuous shall assail him? So when the prouling Wolf, on Ãtna's Vale Thirsting for Blood, o'erleaps the Rural Pale, High o'er his Head the dreadful Mountain roars, In Streams erect the spouted Sulphur soars, And boiling to the Plain a blazing Torrent pours. In vain the Savage from the Ruin turns, But ere he dreads his Fate, amidst the Deluge burns. [Exeunt. SCENE opening to the Bower, &amp;c. CÃ¦sar and Cleopatra appear sitting at a Banquet, attended all by Women. CÃ¦sar attentively reading Letters. Cleo. CÃ¦sar, these last Expresses have disturb'd you. Shall we walk forth? or ride? or sail the Nile? Perhaps this Cell's too gloomy; shall we change it? CÃ¦s. The Place might charm a Deity: but while Those smiling Eyes, with such a soft Concern, Pour forth their quick'ning Glances to my Heart, Immortal Pow'rs might change their Heav'n with CÃ¦sar. Cleo. CÃ¦sar, howe'er this Flattery charms my Ear, My Sense is not so lull'd, but that I saw You read those Letters, with a pensive Eye! Why were they suffer'd to invade you here? Was this a Place, for Bus'ness to intrude? CÃ¦s. 'Twas your Command, my Queen, I shou'd peruse them. Cleo. 'Twas that my Heart, then, cou'd refuse you nothing. I'll know this Secret, CÃ¦sar, that affects you. CÃ¦s. Away, you jealous one! there! tire your Patience. [Gives her the Letters. Cleo. My Jealousy is cur'd! nor wanted I To search the Secrets, but the Heart of CÃ¦sar. Since you permit me, I no more am curious. [Gives back the Letters. CÃ¦s. If I seem'd pensive, 'twas the Lover's Fear; The Fear of being torn from Cleopatra. Cleo. Nay, then I am concern'd, to know the Cause. CÃ¦s. The restless World, I find, envious of CÃ¦sar, Resolves to spin Resistance to the last. These Letters, from Achaia, bring me Word, That Scipio, Appius, Juba, lately join'd, Have call'd on Cato, to command their Forces; Who from Corcyra, since, has put to Sea, To head the Contest, and revenge Pharsalia. Cleo. Alas, vain Men! have they not try'd their CÃ¦sar? Since they prefer their Ruin, to Submission, 'Tis but to March! to Meet them! and to Conquer! CÃ¦s. How soon, that March, from Ãgypt might recall me, Was what o'ercast my Thoughts, for Cleopatra. Cleo. As CÃ¦sar's Fame, in Arms, first warm'd her Heart, So what supports his Glory, feeds her Flame! But vacant Moments shou'd indulge Desire! CÃ¦s. O cease, thou soft'ning Syren, thus to chant! Lest, while I gaze, and listen to thy Voice, I bury, in those Arms, the CÃ¦sar that subdu'd thee! Cleo. What is this secret Charm, in martial Men, That more than others, finds our Sex so easie? CÃ¦s. The Brave, and Fair, methinks, become the Passion. Cleo. And yet they tell me, CÃ¦sar, once you lov'd An Ethiop Queen! was it her Crown that charm'd you? How cou'd you bear a DÃ¦mon in your Arms? CÃ¦s. She serv'd sometimes to kill the Soldier's Care, And guarded Nature, from the Chains of Beauty. Soldiers but ill obey their sighing Leader! Cleo. Yet Antony has led victorious Legions, Tho' he now sends successless Sighs to Love. CÃ¦s. For whom? successless Sighs! impossible! Cleo. Indeed, I fear me, CÃ¦sar, he's thy Rival. For while I gave him Audience, his Confusionâ CÃ¦s. Was what became the Softness of his Errand. Cleo. If he were guilty, you cou'd pardonâ CÃ¦s. Pardon! Were it his Crime that Cleopatra's fair? Shou'd I condemn him, that he thought, like me? Were not his Passion justify'd by CÃ¦sar's? Cleo. CÃ¦sar, I love you not, you're all Ambition! How can you love, so free from Jealousy? CÃ¦s. Why shou'd I either doubt my Friend, or wrong My Cleopatra? where I love; I trust! A gen'rous Flame's the Vigour of the Soul! But shamefac'd Jealousy is mean Desire! Where once Suspicion enters, CÃ¦sar's Love Must leave the Banquet, to the next invited! But why these needless Wiles, to alarm A Heart too willing of itself to yield? Cleo. Forgive me, Julius! if a Heart, like mine, Thinks Art a Duty, to insure its Wishes! Can I be too secureâI don't complain! No! when I've Cause, my Suff'rings shall be silent. CÃ¦s. Thou Soul of Loveâ Cleo. Let us have Musick, CÃ¦sar. A pleasing Sadness hangs upon my Heart, Which I, methinks, wou'd sooth with Harmony. CÃ¦s. Indulge the Softness, and inflame thy CÃ¦sar! O Rome, thy Envy of my Fortune, now, Were just! reproach me! hate me! style me Tyrant! Let Cato rail, but thus let CÃ¦sar triumph! [Embraces her. [A Trumpet is heard at a distance. Cleo. Whence that unbidden Sound? Look forth, my Charmion. [Exit Charmion. CÃ¦s. A Trumpet! here!âcan call on none but CÃ¦sar. Cleo. A thousand various Apprehensions shake me: Some Rashness of the King, t'assert his Power! CÃ¦s. Fear not, my Queen, while CÃ¦sar is thy Guard. Re-enter Charmion. Cleo. Now! th'Occasion. Char. Madam, 'tis Antony, With earnest Voice he hollows o'er the Lake, For Speech with CÃ¦sar. Cleo. Antony! CÃ¦s. Your Leave, My Queen, for his Admittance. Cleo. At CÃ¦sar's Pleasure. But let not me be present to his Audience. CÃ¦s. Think you, I fear, to trust your Interview? Cleo. Cou'd it oblige my CÃ¦sar, I might stay. But in my Sense, 'twere kinder to retire. [CÃ¦sar leads her forth, and returns. CÃ¦s. I like not this AlarmâSome new Disorder! I've been remissâbut 'tis the Life of CÃ¦sar, To struggle with Annoyance. Enter Antony. Now, the News! I read it, Marcus, in the Looks, unwelcome! No matter, speak it whole, nor spare thy Terrors. Ant. CÃ¦sar, be now thy self! the Terror's new! The Captains of thy Legions mutiny. CÃ¦s. They must be quell'd! Proceed! their Grievances. Give me the Terms of Insolence, that spoke them? Ant. Tho' of themselves, too prompt to murmur, at Their Toils, while CÃ¦sar revels out the War! I fear the gen'rous Freedom you've allow'd Cornelia's Followers, has inflam'd the Tumult! In friendly Bowls they mingle, with our Chiefs; Where Sons with Sires, Brothers with Brothers meeting, Rush into former Fondness! Foes no more! Remorse, and Shame of mutual Guilt, subdues 'em. Now loud they curse the Rashness of their Cause, Renounce their Hatred, and embrace in Love. Swear, they, no more, will aggravate their Crime; Nor glut, with Roman Blood, one Man's Ambition. Peace they resolve! and as they're Romans born, Are free,and have as ample Right to end, As CÃ¦sar to commence the War. CÃ¦s. My Patience! Has Conquest then so pamper'd them! so high, In jauncing Pride, that they disdain their Rider? Ant. Nor, came they hither (thus they talk) to quell Ãgyptian Jars; nor, for a Wanton's Lip, To prostitute the Terror of their Arms. CÃ¦s. Where, Marcus, may I face this bellowing Herd? That, like the Lion, CÃ¦sar may disperse them. Ant. I left them swarming in the Palace Court, Where Decius, to prevent the spreading Flame, Holds them in Parley, while I made speed to CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. 'Tis well; they shall be Judges of their General! It must be so! No time for cool Resolves! The Cure must, like the Malady, be desperate! But, CleopatraâNo!âStaying, to part, Might let the Torrent swell, to part us ever! Befriend me, Marcus, in this Exigence; Wait thou the Queen, inform her what has chanc'd, Tell her, what dire Convulsions tore me hence, But that I left my Friend, my dearer half, To swage her Fears, and mitigate my parting. [Exit. Ant. What pleasing Terrors fill, at once, my Soul? What Solitude! what Scenes of soft Retirement! The Place infuses languishing Desire! The Fair alone, and pensive! Antony Commission'd, as a Friend, to sooth her Fears, To pour out all my full Benevolence Of Heart, to calm her Sighs, for CÃ¦sar's Absence? Tumultuous Joy!âBut oh! the torturing Task! How, in the Friend, shall I conceal the Lover? How, for my Rival, can I plead sincere? When my own Suff'rings want her softer Pity? Why hast thou bound me, CÃ¦sar, by thy Trust, To lose this Crisis of complaining Love? Thy happier Stars, thy Pow'r, thy Conquests, Fame, Have strew'd thy Way with Roses, to her Arms! But what, alas! can lift my Hopes so high? My Laurels sprout but from the Root of CÃ¦sar; Obscure, and shaded, by his loftier Boughs: Despairing Antony, at best, but brings A bleeding Heart, more passionately fond, Yet that, forbid, by Honour, to complain. Enter Cleopatra. Cleo. So soon Dispatcht, my CÃ¦sar! Antony! [Surpiz'd. Ant. Receives this Honour, by the Leave of CÃ¦sar. Cleo. My trembling Heart! What wou'd thy Fears suggest? The Leave of CÃ¦sar! did you ask it? Ant. No! Cleo. Did he impose it! say! or did he think The Bounty greater, to prevent Entreaty? Why has his Absence thus insulted me! That from another's Mouth, I must receive, What CÃ¦sar's Will decrees of Cleopatra! Ant. Cou'd you be calm, you'd find his anxious Loveâ Cleo. Talk not of Love! his Heart is all Ambition! Beauty has only Charms, for useless Hours! But the lov'd Idol of his Soul is Power! To that, as to his Deity ador'd, He kneels, and thinks no Vows but those are sacred! Ant. Had you been Witness of his Pain to part, How his conflicting Soul for Cleopatraâ Cleo. Why staid he not himself, to satisfy My Heart? can mine be eas'd by Deputation? Assign'd, like irksome Bus'ness, to a Proxy? Ev'n Bus'ness is preferr'd to Cleopatra! Has Wedlock bound me tame to his Obedience, Thankful to wait his Leisure of Desire? Have I not scorn'd all Pomp of bridal Honours? Deaf to the distant Sighs of Asia's Kings, To make my Heart a Present worthy CÃ¦sar? Yet came I free, and spotless to his Arms, Unclogg'd with languid Laws of Happiness. And can I bear this cold prudential Flame, That when his Int'rest calls, obsequious flies! Calm to my Love, regardless of my Peace. Ant. Am I forbid to vindicate his Love? Cleo. O, had he ever lov'd, he wou'd have thought The worst of Tortures Bliss, to silent Parting. Ant. Has Antony offended Cleopatra? Is CÃ¦sar's Love, from ought I've said, suspected? Name but wherein, and execute his Vengeance! Here with this Dagger wreak it on my Heart! For I dare die, to prove the Faith of CÃ¦sar. Cleo. Forgive these Sallies of a Heart alarm'd: Too fond and faithful, for its own Repose! I have offended you! Passion uncurb'd In Presence of the innocent, is Insult: If I am not unworthy of your Pardon, Be kind, and dissipate my Doubts of CÃ¦sar. Ant. Ye Gods! how great! how soft her Disposition! [Apart. Cleo. What dire Mischance cou'd force him thus away? Ant. His Life! his Glory! Love! were all at stake! From Causes, now, too tedious to relate, His menacing Centurions mutiny! Flush'd with Success, and vain of Services, They call their General to account his Conquests! Had he not timely flown, to quench the Flame, The Ruin might, ere this, have reach'd him here. He knew, that parting Love counts Hours but Momentsâ And therefore seiz'd that Moment to preserve you. Cleo. How are we sure he may suppress this Tumult? Ant. Banish your Fears! leave CÃ¦sar to his Fortune? His Genius never, at his Need, forsakes him: This Cloud will pass; let but his View confront them, His piercing Eye, like the Gorgonian Shield, Shall turn this big-mouth'd Monster into Stone! Then when like Perseus he returns, in Triumph, Preserv'd Andromeda shall clasp the Hero. Cleo. You Romans want not Wiles of Adulation! You sooth and play, like Wishes, with our Hearts! When I'm in fault to CÃ¦sar, plead for me. The Tongue of Antony were sure to gain him! Had our Ãgyptian Court, in all its Pride, The Nymph, that of his Heart might boast her Conquest, My Pow'r might then reward his Faith to CÃ¦sar. Ant. Ãgypt has found the Faceâbut Antony Has on himself impos'd Despair! the Space Betwixt his Heart and Hopeâis Earth from Heav'n! Nor can my Sighs reproach her Cruelty, Who knowing not her Pow'r, is innocent. While in my Breast, the Anguish I retain, Enduring Virtue triumphs in the Pain, The Sighs of Honour are not Sighs in vain. But shou'd my Falshood once reveal my Care, To ask her Pity might deserve Despair. When by her Eyes enflam'd, upon my Tongue, Burning to speak, my secret Pangs have hung, My Conscious Honour then regain'd the Day, And bore me guiltless, from her Charms, away. [Exit. Cleo. O Antony! had CÃ¦sar not been CÃ¦sar, A Heart like thine had taught me gentler Passion. But Thirst of Empire, seizing on my Soul, Has drove me down the Stream of fierce Ambition. Why did I dally with his gen'rous Flame? Searching the Wound, I never meant to cure? But Beauty, wild with Pow'r, delights to reign O'er Hearts victorious, and enjoys their Pain; And yet how greater far the glorious Lore, To keep one Heart of Merit in our Pow'r, Than making thousand from the Crowd, adore? Be my sole Triumph, but of CÃ¦sar sure, My envy'd Fame shall with his conquer'd World endure.</field>

SCENE The Palace-Court. DECIUS with several CENTURIONS and Inferior Officers of CÃSAR's, in Mutiny. 1 Centurion. Decius, away! in vain wou'd Words appease us! Our Civil War, or CÃ¦sar, is no more. Dec. Is CÃ¦sar, in one Day, your Enemy? 2 Cen. 'Tis time, that Romans shou'd with Rome be Friends. 1 Cen. Have we not spent our Lives, in CÃ¦sar's Service? Dec. And wou'd you basely close 'em with his Ruin? 1 Cen. We see no End of his insatiate Arms. Have we not scatter'd every Region round us With Roman Bones, now whitening to the Sun? And what have the Survivors gain'd, but War? More Blood and War is all the Hope that's left us. We are determin'd! on, to CÃ¦sar! forward! Dec. Yet stay your Madness! think of milder Measures! Temper may bring him willing to your Wishes. 1 Cen. Behold these hoary Heads, that bend beneath Their Helmets, and are blanch'd in CÃ¦sar's Wars! These wither'd Hands, that feebly grasp their Javelins! Harmless as rural Crooks, meer Staffs, for Age! Is War supportable to Life, like this! Is it not time, to let Diseases end us? Have not our Toils, at least, deserv'd an Urn? Or that our wailing Friends might close our Eyes? Still shall we leave our mangled Carcasses Unbury'd, to manure the Earth, for CÃ¦sar? Or knows he not the Strength, that yet is left us, Might, by one Stroke, secure the Peace of Rome? And, with his Head, repay the plunder'd World? Dec. So obstinate! be on your selves, your Fate! He comes, the dauntless, and the dreadful CÃ¦sar! Enter CÃ¦sar with a Javelin. CÃ¦s. Who are these lordly Sires of Civil Power, That summon CÃ¦sar to their bold Tribunal? That, tir'd with Toil, would talk Mankind to Rest, Restrain the Valiant, and Command their Leader? 1 Cen. Here, CÃ¦sar, stands the Power, that made thee Great! Determine, now, to give Mankind Repose. CÃ¦s. Repose be thine! Command, and Toil be CÃ¦sar's. [Kills him. Who next advances, to receive Dismission? Ye noisy! turbulent! vain-glorious Rout! Are you the Arbiters of CÃ¦sar's Cause? Like Fate, to limit, or withhold his Conquests? Cou'd you presume, that your poor Aid withdrawn, Wou'd leave his Standards naked in the Field? If Pompey's routed Cause, o'er burning Sands, Can draw such Numbers, to resume the War, Can CÃ¦sar's Eagles droop, in full Success? Can the Victorious fail of worthier Hands, To bear our Trophies, and divided Spoil, To Rome? While you, inglorious in Repose, Are deafned with the Clangors of our Triumphs? Hence, from my Sight, ye murmuring heartless Herd! Ye Undeservers of Pharsalian Honour! Such dastard Spirits are unfit to follow, Where CÃ¦sar, and his Fortune, leads the Brave. Hence, to your abject Homes! there pine in Corners! There waste your winking Lamps of Life away, And leave your General to be singly glorious! Dec. O mighty CÃ¦sar! see, thy prostrate Bands Confus'd, and suppliant at thy Feet for Pardon! O calm thy dreadful Brow! thy Decius kneels! They all throw themselves at CÃ¦sar's Feet. Convinc'd of what their Truth, by me pronounces! Thy warlike Spirit has reviv'd their Flame! While they behold their General's Breast thus fir'd, Thus blazing onward, in the Course of Glory, Their glowing Hearts imbibe the Martial Ardor, Forgetful of their Toils, or Wounds unheal'd, Pharsalian Vigour swells their Streams of Life, And pants for Conquests, to retrieve their CÃ¦sar. CÃ¦s. Decius, to thee, CÃ¦sar consigns their Fate: Disperse them to their Posts: There, Man by Man, Examine to the Source of this Disorder: If Treason sprung it, or meer Martial Licence, Those who are sound in Heart, retain and Pardon; The Factious and the Stubborn bear to Justice.â Yet stayâIf I mistake not, in the Crowd, I see a Face, that has a claim to pardon! That's he!âSoldier, come forthâthou seem'st disabled! 2 Cen. CÃ¦sar, I am: the Sinews of this Arm Are useless. CÃ¦s. Thou wert Wounded at Pharsalia? 2 Cen. Has CÃ¦sar then forgot? when o'er the Head Of Brutus there, this Arm was rais'd in Air, Thy hasty Sword, to save him from the Blow, Unstrung these Nerves, before his Fate cou'd reach him. CÃ¦s. I rememberâwhat mov'd thee to this Tumult? 2 Cen. Resentment of thy broken Promises. CÃ¦s. If in my Course of Cares, thy Merit scap'd me, Why sought'st thou not occasion, to remind me? 2 Cen. Because I found it easier to deserve, Than ask Reward! which due from CÃ¦sar too, I thought secure; but felt my Arm forgotten, And therefore rais'd this other to revenge it. CÃ¦s. Thy Charge is Just, and turns thy Crime on CÃ¦sar; Thy Bluntness speaks it, but mistaken Virtue. Give me thy Pardon, Soldier, for thy Wrong. 2 Cen. CÃ¦sar, I lov'd thee ever, but was griev'd, To think the Wound, my General's Mercy gave, Had only mark'd me, to reproach his Honour. CÃ¦s. Decius, this Instant, let a Donative Of ten great Attick Talents, be his Meed! And to supply the Wreath he might have torn From Brutus' Head, to the first vacant Cohort Be his Command preferr'd. 2 Cen. What Roman Heart Beats not at CÃ¦sar's Virtue? CÃ¦s. If on search, Thou find'st amongst these Numbers, Men whose Age Has led them to the Verge of drooping Life, Let Sums proportion'd to their Service be Disburs'd, and Convoys order'd, to their Country. Omnes. None, CÃ¦sar, none! our Swords, our Lives are CÃ¦sar's. CÃ¦s. Then CÃ¦sar is again your Fellow-Soldier. [They Shout. For further Thanks, my Veterans, attend me. Lead to the Palace. Enter Cornelia. Corn. CÃ¦sar, guard thy Life! CÃ¦s. Let Danger face me, and the Guard is present. Corn. Revenge, and Treason, in these Walls, determin'd, Lye lurking for thy Bloodâthe moment that Thou enter'st here, a thousand furious Daggers Will clash their Points within thy Bosom! This Contains the Plan, the Means, th'Accomplices! [Gives a Schedule. CÃ¦s. Gods! am I rivall'd by Cornelia's Virtue! O Roman Spirit! let my Envy thank thee! Corn. Thanks I refuse; thy Envy were my Glory! This just Discovery to my self was due. Without Conditions, therefore have I made it. Yet I must own, one Life even Honour stands Engag'd to ask; be that in CÃ¦sar's Breast. CÃ¦s. Cornelia's Honour, here, gives Laws to CÃ¦sar. Corn. Fulvius, a faithful Servant in my Train, (Whose Zeal impatient in the Cause of Rome, Had rashly join'd him in this Enterprize,) Reflecting how the Deed abortive might Involve Great Pompey's Relict in the Ruin, In duteous Confidence reveal'd the Secret; 'Twas thus Cornelia's, and from her, 'tis CÃ¦sar's! CÃ¦s. O Pompey! Envy not Pharsalia's Field! Tho' CÃ¦sar conquer'd, thy Cornelia triumphs. Corn. Yet think not, CÃ¦sar, that I've spar'd thy Life, To form a Friendship, where my Hate is due; No, I preserv'd thee, but to use thy Power, In what, I know, thy Glory is concern'd, To wreak thy Vengeance on my Pompey's Murderers! That past; again, I give thee to the Sword, A nobler Victim to the Laws of Rome. CÃ¦s. Each Moment of that Life, thou hast giv'n to CÃ¦sar, Is lost, while Pompey's Vengeance is delay'd! I gave thee Orders, Decius, to demand Th'Assassins, and Advisers of his Fate. Are they surrender'd? Dec. CÃ¦sar, no!âthe King Illudes thy Power: Ere his unwilling Search Pursu'd them, we have Cause to think, he sent His private Notice to advise their Flight. Ev'n in th'Ãgyptian Camp, they're now protected; Where fierce in Menaces, they brave thy Vengeance. CÃ¦s. Brav'd by Ãgyptians! let our Troops be form'd! Pursue them, by a Trumpet! if refus'd, Say, CÃ¦sar, by his Legions, will demand them. Call from the Fleet our Germans, to inforce us! This Scheme describes an Aqueduct, a Vault Thro' which this Earthborn Treason is to speed. Draw out five Cohorts, to secure the Streets, And guard our Pioneers, while they dig through, And with a Barrier Wall cut short their March; Then, from the Sluices, drown them in the Cavern. Cornelia! when this Treason is supprest, CÃ¦sar will give due Order for thy Freedom, With Convoys, to whatever Port, thy Friends, Thy Hopes, or Fortune of thy Cause, shall call thee. Corn. CÃ¦sar, in vain I leave this fatal Shore, Unless Indulgent to my Woes, thou grant One farther Boon. CÃ¦s. Cornelia might Command it.â Corn. Of all the Trophies thy Pharsalia boasts, Yield to my suppliant Sorrows, Pompey's Ashes. CÃ¦s. Philip, his faithful manumitted Slave, Having preserv'd them, in too mean an Urn, I therefore charg'd Achoreus to provideâ Corn. 'Tis not the Casket gives the Treasure Value, The meanest Urn is dignify'd by Tears! The Bones of Pompey will adorn his Tomb. CÃ¦s. Archoreus with the mournful Object shall Attend thee.âAntony! Enter Antony. Ant. CÃ¦sar, to Arms! From the Ãgyptian Camp, our Spies inform us, That for some sudden, hostile Enterprize, Their March is speeding onward to the City! That fierce Photinus, and Achillas' Rage, To save themselves, or to redeem their King From Roman Power, have blown this Tempest up, Determin'd on their own, or CÃ¦sar's Fate, To stake the Chains, or Liberty of Ãgypt. CÃ¦s. Thy News has but confirm'd our earlier Notice. Ant. O! I foresaw this Beauty wou'd be fatal! CÃ¦s. Let Marcus then be warn'd by CÃ¦sar's Error! [Apart. The time yet serves to mend itânow my Veterans! 2 Cen. Now, CÃ¦sar, we'll redeem our blasted Honour, And guard thy Glories, from the Fate of Pompey. CÃ¦s. Since to prevent, our Arms arriv'd too late, Like Romans follow, and revenge his Fate. [Exit, cum suis. Corn. No, CÃ¦sar, to destroy thee, tho' 'twere Just, Revenge is mean, when stain'd by Treachery! Pharsalia, Rome, and Pompey's Blood, demand An equal Desolation of thy Fame! Ev'n at thy Legions Head, in open Field, Where Conquest gave thee Usurpation! there! There, to deplume thee of thy crested Glories! When my Victorious Father, and the Sons Of Pompey, may like ecchoing Hunters chace thee, With all thy branching Honours on thy Head, And circling round thy Fall, enjoy thy Ruin! Then, then were Romeâand Pompey's Fame reveng'd! But from this Blow, the Gods and Honour guard thee! For O! thou wert his Victor, not Assassin! And howsoe'er thy Cause reviles thy Arms, Yet Roman Justice scorns the Sword of Treason! Enter Achoreus with Pompey's Urn. But see! the Holy Priest obeys! and from The Gates of Plenty comes, to feed my Woes With CÃ¦sar's charitable Dole of Death: The dear, the mournful, last Remains of Pompey. Acho. From mighty CÃ¦sar, to distrest Cornelia, These honour'd, sacred Relicts, I present; But that thy Piety o'ersways his Will, A nobler Urn had grac'd thy Heroe's Ashes. âGo thou, Achoreus, (said the generous Victor) âCompose her Sorrows! mitigate her Wailings! âTell her, her Virtue has secur'd her Vengeance, âBinding the Life of CÃ¦sar, to pursue it. âBut 'till more glorious Monuments can rise, âEntreat her to accept his previous Victims. Then bending to the great Remains, he sigh'd, Embrac'd themâpaus'dâlet fall a Tear, And with an awful Kiss, gave back the Charge. Corn. O sacred Virtue! teach me, to receive, With Thanks, these Obligations of my Foe; Nor let ungrateful Envy lead my Soul, To wrong the generous, by mean Suspicion! What tho' he rises by the Fall of Pompey! What tho' his Arms opposing Ptolomey, May fix ambitious Cleopatra's Crown? Shall I upbraid the Vengeance, whose Effect Disperses Benefit to more than me? Cornelia, no! 'twere Impious to revile The Sun, for that his Beams are general! Judge CÃ¦sar then in this, to think like thee; Believe the nobler Motive rules his Heart, And own the Debt of his Revenge, and Tears. Acho. Thus Virtue never is defac'd! unchang'd By strokes of Fate, she triumphs o'er Distress, And ev'ry bleeding Wound adorns her Beauty. [Trumpets and Shouts at a distance. But hark! th'Alarm is giv'n! and CÃ¦sar now Again is dealing the Decrees of Fate! In time retire! the Ruin here may reach you. Corn. What Ruin can come nearer to my Heart? [Folding the Urn in her Arms. O grudge me not this dear Repast of Grief! Grief is the only Food my Sense can bear! Love has resign'd its Fondness to Affliction, Which with the same Impatience seeks its Object, And thus wou'd feed its Woes with full Despair. [Shout. Charge. [She opens the Urn gently, and gazes into it kneeling, while Achoreus speaks. Acho. Again! the Storm of War approaches! Gods! She hears it not! Immers'd in deeper Woes! Did ever Grief thus dignify the Heart? See how her agonizing Frame endures! While Tears run back in wonder of her Woe. [Trumpets. With Care observe the Sallies of her Soul, [To her Attendants. While I explore th'impending Danger: Guard Her Griefs from Violence, 'till my Return May judge, if Courts, or Temples may protect her. [Exit. Corn. 'Tis done! the Debt of Nature is discharg'd! Great, injur'd, peaceful, dear Remains farewel! Grief has enjoy'd its Ecstacy of Pain! [Closes the Urn. And now a nobler Duty claims my Soul, Revenge and Rome demand me back to Life, To animate our Cause, 'till Liberty Regain'd, may raise its Altars to thy Name, O Pompey! that last Hope alone prevails; For that blest Hour, I patient breathe, beneath These Loads of dire Calamity. Nor dare, 'Till that's accomplish'd, lay the Burden down! Then shall Cornelia, thro' the Gates of Life, Rush foremost, with the Tidings to thy Shade. [Alarm. Enter Achoreus. Acho. Away, Cornelia! fly! thy Foes have conquer'd! CÃ¦sar is lost! and Ãgypt triumphs o'er The Fate of Pompey. Corn. Gods! it cannot be! Say how! the Terrors of the Day deceive thee! Acho. O no! the King, who warily, at first, Seem'd neutral in the Fray; on his Success, Exulting now, avows the Enterprize, Applauds his Vengeance, and absolves the Crime. Corn. Still am I lost in Wonder! Was not CÃ¦sar By me appriz'd, forewarn'd of this Design? Acho. Too short the Warning, when so near the Blow! For tho' his Care no Moment lost, to stop His latent Danger, from the Aqueduct; Yet, ere his Cohorts from their Ships cou'd land, Or those within the Town be drawn to Order, Our speedier Troops, impetuous as the Tides Of Nile, came pouring thro' our Gates! while CÃ¦sar, Now, like a Vessel from its Anchor blown, Adrift, and useless, down the Stream is born, Lost, and unaided, by the Wrecks around him! Corn. Yet hold! nor let me hear of CÃ¦sar's Fate! Lest Rome, dishonour'd by the Means, shou'd owe Her Liberty to vile Ãgyptian Falshood! Lest the perfidious Ptolomey shou'd buy, With CÃ¦sar's Head, his Pardon, from the Senate, And ward the Vengeance of the Gods, for Pompey! Acho. Who next must bleed, the Gods can tell, but now In dread Confusion, fly the Roman Eagles, Prest, and retreating to the Pharian Isle; There only have the Valiant Choice, to fall On pointed Spears, or perish in the Seas Behind them. The revengeful Ptolomey, Impatient to resume the Reins of Empire, Flew, on the News, to make the Queen his Captive; Pretending, now, she is the Kingdom's Foe, Confederate with CÃ¦sar, to its Ruin! Fly then, Cornelia, from this rolling Danger! Outrage and Slaughter fill the Streets, and sweep, Without Distinction, Innocence along! To Isis' Temple haste! thy Virtue there Secure may wait the Will of Heav'n. Corn. Just Gods! Had I but Life to lose, the Tumult here Might end my Woes; but lesser Cares must wait: To guard these dear Remains, I wave my Fate. [Exe. The SCENE opening to the Palace, discovers Cleopatra guarded. Guard. Here our Commission ends. Th'Occasion, Madam, Of your Confinement now, the King himself Will answerâhe approaches. [Ex. Guards. Enter Ptolomey. Ptol. Gods! I thank you! This Hour has well repaid the Wrongs of Empire. Thou fatal Stain, to the LagÃ¦an Race! Inglorious Helen, to the Peace of Ãgypt! Where is your Paris now? your Reveller! Your Champion CÃ¦sar, who dissolv'd in Pleasures, Contemn'd the Royal Vengeance, that surrounds him? What, are thy boasted Charms abandon'd, lost! Has then this glorious Robber left thee hopeless! From thy unguarded Honour stoln the Gem, And thrown thee, like a useless Casket, by, To make his Flight more speedy? now recall him. Cleo. CÃ¦sar best knows his Timeâyou say he's fled: The Flying live! the Living may return! Ptol. So desperate! canst thou then form a Hope, On CÃ¦sar's Life? are Malefactors said To live, when o'er their destin'd Heads, the Sword Of Justice rais'd in Air, is falling to the Blow? Such is the State of CÃ¦sar, coop'd in Pharos! Cleo. On CÃ¦sar's Fate, I know my own depends: Nor will precarious Life, when he's no more, Be worth my Care: yet in his vanquish'd Heart I reign'd one Day, the World's Imperial Mistress! All Empires have their Period: mine, tho' short On Earth, shall perching on the Wings of CÃ¦sar, Be born through Ages to a deathless Fame! What Beauties yet unborn, reading my Story, Shall find their Virtue stagger, at my Conquest, And sigh for CÃ¦sars, that, like mine, might love! Ptol. Confusion! dar'st thou vaunt thy Infamy? Is kindling Shame a Stranger to thy Cheek? That nor thy Race dishonour'd, nor the Breach Of sacred Laws, can give thy Crimes a Terror? Cleo. Talk'st thou of violated Laws! whose Heart, On cool Deliberation, cou'd renounce them? Who deaf to Obligations, to thy Crown restor'd, To Honour, Gratitude, or Faith of Nations, Cou'dst basely pierce thy Benefactor's Bosom, And stain thy Soul, with bounteous Pompey's Blood? While I, at Hazard of my Throne and Life, Strove by his Safety to prevent thy Crime. If, with Resentment fir'd, I since have leagu'd With CÃ¦sar, to retrieve my Crown; accuse Thy own injurious Arms, that first usurp'd it! Did I not warn thee too of CÃ¦sar's Love? Didst thou not know my Soul was form'd for Empire? And cou'dst thou hope, that maiden Modesty, A peevish Coyness, wou'd restrain Ambition? What are the Laws that ever yet confin'd it? Tho' Love to CÃ¦sar's Merit might be venial! But Nature's whole Consent abhors th'Assassin. Ptol. 'Tis well! this Spirit shall have further Tryal! Who waits? our Guard? Enter Guard hastily. What means thy breathless Terror? Guard. Look forth, and see SirâPharos is in Flames. Ptol. Confusion to my Eyes! [Going to the Window. Cleo. It must be so! The Brand of Vengeance is in CÃ¦sar's Hand. [Apart. Enter Photinus from the other Side. Phot. O Horror! Horror! Ruin, Rage, and Slaughter, With CÃ¦sar's Fortune, follow at our Heels! O Sir! with Shame and Terror, I pronounce it, Fly, fly, while yet Occasion serves, to save you. Ptol. Gods! let me know the Danger, that compels me. Phot. While CÃ¦sar in the Pharian Isle was hemm'd, And to all Eyes, that saw him, deem'd our Prey, Death every Moment feeding on his Front; And on his Rear, no Hope, but Seas to sink him; Yet Fortune, in his last Despair, redeem'd him. While on the narrow Mole, fierce Decius joyn'd With Antony, a while sustain'd the Day; Himself perplex'd, and raging at his Fate, As if, he dying, had resolv'd to light His Funeral Pile, with dread Phalaric Darts, That kindle as they fly, he fires the City; Nor spares our Altars from the blazing Ruin! And now far casting o'er the Main his Eye, With trembling Indignation he beheld His distant Fleet inactive to his Aid. Then heav'd his Breast, and springing with the Thought, He headlong plung'd him in the Wavesâ Cleo. My CÃ¦sar! Phot. In one rais'd Hand aloft above the Tide, Some Scrolls of high Importance he preserv'd. And, with his other, plough'd the Surge before him! As oft, athwart the rapid Floods of Nile, Some monstrous Crocodile, in quest of Prey, Rolls his huge Length, thro' Showers of Darts along; So, fearless of the hissing Shafts around him, Swam the fell CÃ¦sar foaming to his Fleet. His Troops, that from their Ships beheld his Danger, With Shouts, that eccho to the Heav'ns, receive him, Nor lose a Moment to regain the Day! Now loaded Galleys ply their stroking Oars, And in an Instant pour them on the Strand. They form! they march! thus CÃ¦sar re-inforc'd, Furious as Libyan Whirlwinds blows his Foes Before him. Ptol. Gods! as Fortune were his Slave! Cleo. Form'd to subdue the World, and charm the Fair! [Exulting. Ptol. What Hope can save us? Phot. On this Side the Pharos, Where yet our fainting Troops dispute his Passage, A light-sail'd Vessel hulls about the Shore. Thence only can your Fortune save you. Cleo. Hold! Yet ere you perish, hear a Sister's Counsel. Spite of my Injuries, a Brother's Blood Sets Nature in too horrible Alarm! And not preventing, is to urge thy Ruin! From CÃ¦sar's Arms, what Earth or Seas can save thee? If then thy Fear suggests, thou hast deserv'd His dread Resentment, trust with me thy Fate: Ne'er shall these Knees unbend from CÃ¦sar's Sight, 'Till Cleopatra's Prayers have seal'd thy Pardon! Ptol. Audacious Insult! Pardon! Shall my Crown, Dependent on a Wanton's Smile, compound Thy Crimes? the Pandar of my own Dishonour? Cleo. Thy Fate be on thy Head! Ptol. The Fate of CÃ¦sar, Alike with Ptolomey's, is fix'd and certain: Who first must perish, to the Gods is known. At least, this Hour shall Honour lost attone; My Rage shall on his Heart revenge our Fame, Or scorn the Life, that dares survive the Shame. [Ex. Ptol. and Pho. Cleo. Ungrateful Boy! thy parting Arrogance Betrays the rooted Rancour in thy Soul: Had CÃ¦sar not espous'd my injur'd Right, Or had my Eyes engag'd his Arms, for thee; Then, what thou term'st my Shame, were courtly Glory. I thought thy Youth misguided by thy Creatures, That they alone had wrought thee, to the Tyrant; But find thy Nature, to their Hands, had form'd thee. My Woman's Heart, forgetful of my Wrongs, Wou'd have commended thee to CÃ¦sar's Mercy; But now, while thus thy Hate disdains my Care, If his just Vengeance, for the Blood of Pompey, Shou'd overtake thy Guilt; reproach thy Rashness. My Fame's acquitted of thy wilful Fate, And Grief, in rising Empire, shall forget thee. [A Flourish. Hark! hark! the Roman Trumpets, like the Voice Of Fate, pronounce to CÃ¦sar's Arms the Day! My Hero! see where joyous Antony Flies with a Lover's Haste, to bear the News. Enter Antony. Ant. Hail! bright Imperial Monarch of the Nile! For such have CÃ¦sar's Fortune, and the Fate Of Ptolomey, ordain'd thee. Cleo. Ptolomey! What dreadful Ruin cou'd so soon o'ertake him? Ant. As CÃ¦sar round the blazing Pharos Led his well-order'd Troops, to quench the Flames; Forth from the Palace, in disorder'd Haste, He saw the King, Photinus, and the Guards, Rush thro' a Band of Romans to the Bay; Where Ptolomey's young Arm so bravely fought, That CÃ¦sar, in the Conflict, call'd aloud, Spare! spare the King! He, scornful of his Mercy, With double Fury now renew'd the Fray! But oh! in vain! breathless, at last, he saw Photinus, and Achillas, by his Side Expire! a Death, for their vile Crimes, too glorious! At length, his Fortune desperate, he broke, With Fury, thro' the Tumult, to the Mole, From whence, into a floating Bark he launch'd, His last Retreat and Hope: but here, his Friends, Too zealous for his Safety, urg'd his Fate; Such Crowds of Followers his Flight attended, That ev'n in CÃ¦sar's View, th'o'er-freighted Boat Sunk foundring down, and perish'd in the Deep. Cleo. Such is the Vengeance of the Gods for Pompey! Ant. Well has his Death atton'd his Errors past, Since injur'd Cleopatra, by his Fall, Enjoys, at last, her undisputed Empire. Ev'n CÃ¦sar fought not for himself, but you: This Moment to your People he proclaims You Queen, and to conciliate to your Crown Their Hearts, and render Ptolomey forgotten, Confirms the Laws and native Rights of Ãgypt. Cleo. Can CÃ¦sar have a Foe, that is not such To Virtue? [Flourish. Hark, he comes! my Conqueror! My Wishes Lord, and Glory of my Heart. Enter CÃ¦sar. She runs to embrace him. CÃ¦s. O my forsaken Fair! my Toils, at length, In Peace and Transport yield me to thy Arms! In all the Conflicts I've, this Day, sustain'd, My Fears for thee sunk deepest in my Heart; And while the Soldier fought, the Lover trembled. But here my Heart, collected to its Joy, Pours out my Cares, forgotten on thy Bosom. Cleo. Now ye chaste Matrons, that reproach my Love, Behold my CÃ¦sar in this Blaze of Glory! O let the Dangers of this Day but speak him! Let impious Treason, thro' the Earth, assail him! Or, in the Pharos, dreadful Flames surround him, Thence hurl him headlong to devouring Seas! While, like the Ocean's God, he rides the Billows, Behold him, thro' this War of Elements Victorious! then! then bid these Arms refuse him! [Shout. Enter Decius Dec. CÃ¦sar, the publick Joy, in Crowds impatient, Swarms round the Palace, to behold their Queen. CÃ¦s. A Moment, and the Queen shall greet them.â Cornelia! Enter Cornelia on the other Side. Corn. CÃ¦sar, with a divided Heart, I come At once to gratulate, and mourn thy Arms: Since Pompey, here, no more Revenge can hope, This fatal Shore is hateful to my Eyes; I therefore now remind thee of thy Word, Thy promis'd Convoys, for my free Departure. Hence let me wing my Flight! with Pompey's Urn, To rouze the drooping Life of Liberty, And arm another World, to blast thy Lawrels! O CÃ¦sar! tremble! for my Soul presages! Howe'er thy lawless Arms may swell thy Power, Think not that Rome, tho' conquer'd, will endure thee! Her Genius, like a Lion tam'd, one Day May turn, when least suspected, on his Keeper, And stalk, in Triumph, o'er the Limbs that aw'd him! Such may be CÃ¦sar's Fate! the Gods have warn'd thee! Wou'dst thou be truly glorious, yield us Peace! To Scipio, Pompey's Sons, and Cato, now I bend my Course; if thou hast ought to offer, That may concern the harrass'd World's Repose, Cornelia shall report it. CÃ¦s. Tell them, this! The Laws they fight for, CÃ¦sar will maintain; Nor are they safer, in their Hands, than his! When I look round the World, and see What Miseries attend Abuse of Power, I judge my Conquests by the Gods assign'd, To give their Laws new Force, and mend Mankind! If then Ambition prompts me to excell The greatest Patriot fam'd for ruling well, Let foul-tongu'd Envy burst her swelling Heart, My conscious Virtue shall perform its Part. CÃ¦sar his Period to the Gods shall trust, Nor can, 'till Gods forsake him, think his Arms unjust.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. OLDFIELD. Was it not Bold, from stated Rules to Rove, And make the Tragic Muse commode to Love? To shew victorious CÃ¦sar turn'd Gallant, And what, in Life, the greatest Warriors want! That all the glorious Battles they may gain, Unless the Fair are Kind, are Fought in vain! Prim Prudes, be sure, will urge, that lawless Fire, In Death, and Desolation, shou'd expire! That Tragedy shou'd fright your Hearts from Evil, And shew, that Love unlicens'dâis the Devil! Suppose this TrueâYet, who's to judge the Error? Wou'd Belles, and Beaux, refuse the Joy, from Terror? Our Author, therefore, tells the downright Story, And lays his Madam's Frailty fair before you: Say, Nymphs! who've seen this Cleopatra die, Were you then cur'd of Love? or did you cry O Ged! my Lord! wou'd you were Antony! Can you then blame a Muse, subdu'd, to write, On what gave CÃ¦sar's Heart such full Delight? Since you in Music found his Charms sublime, Make not a little Common Sense his Crime: But let his Deeds, that through the World have rung, Like Psalms, be pointed, to be said, or sung! 'Tis true, he had not all the Charms in Fashion; His Lawrels gave not, like TupÃ©'s, Temptation. Romans, of old, were no such killing Cattle, Nor wore their Hair, like Cocks, new trimm'd for Battle! Nor knew of Paste, and Puffs, the modish Air, With Heads, like frozen Mops, to melt the Fair! Our Dame's, at least, less liable to Satyr, Tho' frail, she chose the Grand, not Petit MaÃ®tre! Beside, if CÃ¦sar at her Feet cou'd lye, Your Tears may flow more Just, for Antony! Since then, his World well Lost, your Hearts admire, Let Her with CÃ¦sar live, with Antony Expire. FINIS.</field>
