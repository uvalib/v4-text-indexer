      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT Worshipfull William Gowre, Esquire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his learned and much respected friend, Mr. Iames Shirley, vpon his Wedding. An inforc'd rapture, and high swelling phrase Doth onely gaudy ignorance amaze; Conceites that yeelde iudicious Writers glory, Enrich the beauty of thy Comicke Story: Loues passion in smooth numbers is descride, Such as becomes the softnesse of a Bride. I want a Poets aÃ«ry soule, to giue Due prayses to thy lines, which shall out-liue The Crittickes spleene, the Atheists impious iest; A modest pen becomes the Muses best, And such is thine, as thy faire Wedding showes, Who Crownes thee not, a debt to knowledge owes. Edmond Colles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his worthy Friend Mr. Shirley, vpon his Nuptiall Comedy. Is Beaumont dead? or slept he all this while, To teach the World the want of his smooth stile? If he be dead, that part of him Diuine By transmigration of his soule is thine: High is thy fancy, yet thy straine so sweete, Death would be lou'd in such a winding sheete: This Wedding needes no Offering, and thy worth Is aboue flattery, to set thee forth: From whose rich Muse thus Wedded, we shall see Many faire Children borne to PoÃ«sie. Robert Haruey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Spread faire thou growing Tree, with which in vaine The windes do wraste: Blemish'd with the staine Of impure life, some by Atheisticke rimes, And witty surfeits, force these ruder times To fond amazement; but thy faire defence Rests in cleare Arte, and secure Innocence. As thou, thy Muse is chast, on which no Rape VVas ere by thee committed, Learnings Ape Is franticke imitation; and the Bough That Crownes such VVriters, withers on their brow: I gratulate thy Wedding; Loue doth guide My friendly Muse, thus to salute thy Bride. William Habington.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my deseruing friend Mr. Iames Shirley, vpon his Comedy, the Wedding. Thou need'st not, friend, that any man for thee, Should to the World put in security. Thy Comedy is good; 'twill passe alone, And faire enough, without this ribbands showne Vpon the fore-head on't: if high rays'd passion Temper'd with harmelesse mirth, in such sweet fashion, And with such harmony, as may inuite Two faculties of soule, and both delight Deserue an approbation, in mine eye, Such in iust value is this Comedy. Tho. May.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of this Ingenious Comedy the Wedding. To Mr. Iames Shirley the Author. The Bonds are equall, and the Marriage fit, Where iudgement is the Bride, the Husband wit; Wit hath begot, and iudgement hath brought forth A noble issue, of delight, and worth, Growne in this Comedy to such a strength Of sweete perfection, as that not the length Of dayes, nor rage of mallice, can haue force To sue a nullity, or worke diuorce Betweene this well trim'd Wedding, and loud Fame, Which shall in euery age, renew thy Name. Iohn Ford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primi. ScÅna Prima. Enter Sir Iohn Belfare, and Isaac his man, seruants bringing in Prouision. Belfare. Well done my Masters, yee bestirre your selues, I see we shall feast to morrow. Ser. Your worship shall want no Wood-cockes at the Wedding. Isa. Thou hast as many as thou canst carry, and thirteene to the last dozen. Bel. Isaac. Isa. Sir. Bel. Haue you beene carefull, to inuite those friends, you had direction for? Isa. Yes sir, I haue beene a continuall motion euer since I rise, I haue not sayd my prayers to day. Bel. We shall want no guests then. Isa. I haue commanded most on'em. Bel. How sir? Isa. I ha'bid 'em sir, there's two in my list, will not fayle to dine w'ee. Bel. Who are they? Isa. Master Rawbone, the yong vsurer. Bel. Oh hees reported a good Trencher-man, He has a tall stomacke, he shall be welcome. Isa. They say, he has made an Obligation to the Diuell, if euer he eate a good meale at his owne charge, his soule is forfeit. Bel. How does he liue? Isa. Vpon his mony sir. Bel. He does not eate it. Isa. No the Diuell choake him, it were a golden age, if all the Vsurers in London should ha'no other dyet; hee has a thingut waytes vpon him, I thinke, one of his bastards, be got vppon a spider, I hope to liue, to see 'em both drawne through a ring. Bel. Who is the other? Isa. The other may be knowne too, the barrell at Heidelberg was the patterne of his belly, Master Lodam sir. Bel. Hee's a great man indeede. Isa. Something giuen to the wast, for he liues within no reasonable compasse I'm sure. Bel. They will be well met. Isa. But very ill matcht to draw a Coach, yet at prouender, there wil be scarce an Oate betweene the leane iade, and the fat Gelding. Bel. How liues he? Isa. Religiously sir; for hee that feedes well, must by consequence liue well, hee holds none can be dam'd but leane men, for fat men he sayes must needes bee sau'd by the faith of their body. Enter Mr Beauford, and Captaine Landby. Bel. Mr. Beauford and Captayne Landby: Isaac, call forth my Daughter. Beau. Sir Iohn, I hope you make no stranger of me, To morrow, I shall change my title for Your sonne, soone as the holy rites shall make me The happy husband to your daughter, in the meane time It will become me wayte on her. Bel. I possesse nothing but in trust for thee, Gratiana makes all thine. Cap. I shall presume to follow. Bel. Your friendship noble Captaine to Mr. Beauford, Makes your person most welcome, Had you no other merit, pray enter. Exe. Bea. &amp; Cap. Heauen hath already crownd my gray hayres! I liue to see my daughter married To a noble husband, the enuye of our time, And exact patterne of a Gentleman, As hopefull as the Spring, I am growne proud, Euen in my age. Exit. Enter Marwood. Mar. Dost heare sirra? Isa. I sirra. Mar. Is Master Beauford within? Isa. No sir. Mar. I was inform'd he came hither, is he not here? Isa. Yes sir. Mar. Thou sayst he's not within. Is. No sir, but tis very like he wilbe to morrow night sir. Mar. How is this? Is. Would you haue him be within before he is married. Mar. Witty Groome, prethee inuite him forth; say here's a friend Is. Now you talke of inuiting, I haue two or three guests to inuite yet: let me see. Mar. Why dost not mooue? Is. And you make much adoe, ile inuite you: pray come to the Wedding to morrow. Exit. Enter Sir Iohn Belfare, Beauford, and Captaine. Bel. Tis hee. Bea. You were my happy prospect from the window, Coose you are a most welcome guest. Bel. Mr. Marwood, you haue beene a great stranger to the City, or my house for the course entertaynement you receiu'd, hath beene vnworthy of your visit. Mar. Twas much aboue my desert sir: Captayne. Cap. I congratulate your returne. Bel. Beauford, Gentlemen enter my house, And perfect your embraces there: I lead the way. Exit. Bea. Pray follow. Mar. Your pardon. Cap. We know you haue other habit, You were not wont to affect ceremony. Mar. &amp; Bea whisper, Bea. How? Cap. I do not like his present countenance, It does threaten somewhat; I wo'd not prophesie. Bea. Good Captayne, Excuse my absence to our friends within, I haue affayres concernes me with my kinsman, Which done, we both returne to wayte on 'em. Cap. I shall sir. Bea. Now proceed. Mar. We are kinsmen. Bea. More we are friends. Mar. And shal I doubt to speak to Beauford any thing, My loue directs me to? Bea. What needs this circumstance? Wee were not wont to talke at such a distance, You appeare wild. Ma. I haue beene wilde indeede In my vngouernd youth, but ha' reclaimd it, And am so laden with the memory of former errours, That I desire to be confest. Bea. Confest? I am no Gostly father. Ma. But you must heare, you may absolue mee too: Bea. If thou hast any discontentments prethee take other time For their discourse, I am in expectation of Marriage, I would not interrupt my ioyes. Ma. I must require your present hearing, It concernes vs both, as neere as fame, or life. Bea. Ha! what is it? Ma. Wee shall haue opportunity at your lodging, The streetes are populous and full noise, So please you walke, Ile wait one you. Bea. Ime your seruant. Exeunt. Enter Iustice Landby, and Milisent. Iust. Milisent. Where's my daughter? Mil. In complement with Mr. Rawbone, who is newly entred sir. Iust. O there's a peece of folly. A thing made vp of parchment and his bonds Are of more value then his soule and body, Were any man the purchaser, onely wise In his hereditary trade of vsury, Vnderstands nothing but a scriuener, As if he were created for no vse But to grow rich with intrest, to his ignorance, He ha's the gift, of being impudent, What will he grow to, if he liue, that is So young a monster? Mil. With your fauour sir If you hold no better opinion of this Citizen It puzles, mee why you inuite him, to your house And entertainement, he pretending affection to your daughter, Pardon me sir if I seeme bold. Iust. As some men Milisent Do suffer spiders in their Chamber, while They count them profitable vermine. Mil. But he's most like to scatter poyson sir, Your fame is precious, and your family Not mingling with corrupted streames, hath like An entire Riuer, still maintayn'd his current Chast, and delightfull. Iust. Sha't receiue my bosome, Ile sooner match her with an Ethiope, Then giue consent, she should disgrace our blood; And herein I but trye her strength of iudgement In giuing him accesse; if she haue lost Remembrance of her birth, and generous thoughts, She suck'd from her dead mother, with my care Ile striue to reinforce her natiue goodnesse, Or quite diuorse her from my blood: and Milisent Ile vse your vigilance. Mil. Sir command. Iust. I will, Not vrge how I receiu'd you first a stranger, Nor the condition of your life, with me, Aboue the nature of a seruant, to Obliege your faith: I haue obserued thee honest. Mil. You are full of noble thoughts. Iust. Though I suspect not The obedience of my daughter, yet her youth Is apt to erre, let me employ your eye Vpon her still, and receiue knowledge from you, How she dispenceth fauours, you shall binde My loue the stronger to you. Mil. Sir, I shall be ambitious to deserue your fauour Withall the duties of a seruant, and I doubt not, but your Daughter is so full Of conscience, and care in the conformity Of her desires to your will, I shall Inrich my sight with obseruation, And make my intelligence happy. Enter Cameleon. Iust. How now: what's he? Mil. Tis Mr. Rawbones squire. Cam. Pray is not my Masters worship here? Iust. Your Masters worship! What's that, his Spaniell? Cam. No sir, but a thing that does follow him. Iust. In what likenesse, I hope he does not conuerse with spirits. Cam. Heele not entertayne an Angell, But he will weigh him first, indeede I am all the spirits that belong to him. Mil. So I thinke, but none of his familiar. Iust. What's thy name? Cam. Cameleon. Iust. Good; didst euer eate? Cam. Yes once. Iust. And then thou caught'st a surfeit, thou couldst nere endure meate since: wer't euer christned. Cam. Yes twice, first in my infancy, And the last time about a yeare agoe, When I should haue beene prentise to an Anabaptist. Iust. Does thy Master loue thee? Cam. Yes, for, and I would gold I might haue it, But my stomacke would better digest beefe, or mutton, If there be any such things in nature. Mil. Here is his Master sir, and Mistris Iane. Enter Rawbone, and Iane. Raw. How now Cameleon, hast din'd? Cam. Yes sir, I had a delicate fresh ayre to dinner. Raw. And yet thou lookst as thou hadst eate nothing this se'night, here prouide me a Capon, and halfe a dozen of Pidgeons to supper, and when will your worship come home, and tast my Hospitality. Ian. When you please sir, Raw. Yet now I thinke on't, I must feede more sparingly. Ian. More liberally in my opinion. Raw. Would not any body in the world thinke so? did you euer see two such eare-wigges as my man and I: doe wee not looke like. Ian. I thinke the picture of eyther o'your faces in a ring, with a Memento mori, would be as sufficient a mortification, as lying with an Anotomy. Raw. The reason why wee are so leane and consum'd, is nothing, but eating too much: Cameleon now I thinke on't, let the Pygeons alone, the Capon will bee enough for thee and I. Cam. The rumpe would last vs a se'night. Raw. I tell you forsooth, I ha brought my selfe so low, with a great dyet, that I must be temperate, or the Doctor sayes there's no way but one wo'me. Cam. That's not the way of all flesh I'm sure. Raw. It is a shame to say, what we eate euery day. Ian. I thinke so. Cam. By this hand: if it would beare an oath: wee haue had nothing this two dayes but halfe a Larke; which by a mis-chance the Cat had kild too, the Cage being open: I will prouide my belly another Master. Iust. Now Ile interrupt em Master Rawbone. Raw. I hope your Worship will repriue my boldnesse, Tis out of loue to your daughter. Iust. Sir, I haue a businesse to you, a friend of mine vpon some necessity would take vp a hundred pounds. Raw. Ile pawne some ounces to pleasure him. Iust. It is more friendly sayd then I expected. Raw. So he bring me good security, some three or Foure, or fiue sufficient and able Citizens, for Mortalities sake, ile lend it him. Iust. Will you not take an honest mans word. Raw. Few words to the wise, I will take any mans word to owe me a hundred pound, but not a Lords to pay me fifty. Iust. Well: tis a curtesie. Raw. He shall pay nothing to me but lawfull consideration from time to time, beside the charges of th'ensealing, because he is your friend. Iust. This is extreamity, can you require more? Raw. More? whats eight in the hundred to me? my Scriuener knowes, I haue taken forty and fifty in the hundred vijs and modis of my owne kins-men, when they were in necessity. Iust. I apprehend the fauour: Enter Isaac. How now Isaac? Is. My master commends his loue to you sir, and does desire your presence together with your Daughter and Nephew, at the arraignement of my young mistresse to morrow. Iust. How knaue? Is. Shee is to be married or arraign'd, ith'morning, and at night to suffer execution and loose her head. Iust. Returne our thankes, and say wee'le waite vppon the Bride Iane. Exeunt Iustice and Iane. Is. Deare Master Rawbone, I doe beseech you bee at these Sessions. Raw. Thou didst inuite me before. Is. I know it, but our Cooke has a great minde, that sentence should likewise passe vppon the toast, the boyld, and the bak'd, and hee feares vnlesse you be a Commissioner, the meate will hardly bee condemn'd to morrow, so that I can neuer often enough desire your stomacke to remember, you will come. Raw. Dost thinke I wonot keepe my word? Is. Alas, wee haue nothing, but good cheere to entertayne you, I beseech you sir howsoeuer to feast with us, though you goe away after dinner. Raw. There's my handâ Isa. I thanke you. Raw. Is master Iustice gone, and mistresse Iane too? follow me Cameleon. Ile take my leaue when I come agen. Mil. Isaac. Isa. My little wit, thou wo't come with thy master tomorrow, Ile reserue a bottle of wine to warme thy sconce. Mil. I cannot promise. Isa. If I durst stay three minutes, I would venture a cup with thee ith'buttery, but tis a busie time at home: Farewell Milisent. Exit. Mil. Marriage as much ioy waite vpon the Bride, As the remembrance of it brings me sorrow, A woman has vndone me, when I dye A Coffin will enclose this misery. Exit. Enter Beauford and Marwood. Beau. You prepare me for some wonder. Mar. I doe: And ere I come to the period of my Story, Your vnderstanding will admire. Beau. Teach my soule the way. Mar. I am not Cose ith'number of those friends Come to congratulate your present marriage. Beau. Ha? Mar. I am no flatterer, the blood you carry Doth warme my veines, yet could nature be Forgetfull and remoue it selfe, the loue I owe your merit, doth oblige me, to Relation of a truth which else would fire My bosome with concealement. I am come To deuide your soule, rauish all your pleasures, Poyson the very ayre maintaynes your breathing, You must not marry. Beau. Must not? though as I Am mortall I may be compeld within A payre of minutes to turne ashes, yet My soule already Bride-groome to her vertue, Shall laugh at Death that would vnmarry vs, And call her mine eternally. Mar. Death is A mockery to that diuorce I bring, Come you must not loue her. Beau, Did I hope thou couldst Giue me a reason, I would aske one. Mar. Do not, I will too soone arriue, and make you curse Your knowledge, couldst exchange thy temper for An angels, at the hearing of this reason, 'Twould make you passionate, and turne man agen. Beau. Can there be reason for a sinne so great, As changing my affection from Gratiana? Name it, and teach me how to be a monster, For I must loose humanity, oh Marwood, Thou leadst me into a Wildernesse, she isâ Mar. False, sinnefull, a blacke soule she has. Bea. Thou hast a hell about thee, and thy language Speakes thee a Diuell, that to blast her innocence Dost belch these vapours: to say thou lyest, Were to admit, thou hast but made in this A humane errour, when thy sinne hath aym'd The fall of goodnesse. Gratiana false? The snow shall turne a Salamander first And dwell in fire; the ayre retreate, and leaue An emptinesse in nature, angels be Corrupt, and brib'd by mortals sell their charity Her innocence is such, that wert thou Marwood For this offence condemn'd to lodge in flames, It would for euer cure thy burning feauer, If with thy sorrow thou procure her shed One teare vpon thee, now, thou art lost for euer, And arm'd thus, though with thousand furies guarded, I reach thy heart. Drawes: Mar. Stay Beauford, Since you dare be so confident of her chastity Heare me conclude, I bring no idle fable Patcht vp betweene suspition, and report Of scandalous tongues, my eares were no assurance To conuince me without my eyes. Bea. What horror! Be more particular: Mar. I did prophesie, That it would come to this, for I haue had A tedious strugling with my nature, but The name of friend ore-ballanc'd the exception: Forgiue me Ladies, that my loue to man Hath power to make me guilty of such language, As with it, must betray a womans honour: Bea. You torture me, be briefe. Mar. Then, though it carry shame to the reporter, Forgiue me heauen, and witnesse an vnwelcome truth. Bea. Stay, I am too hasty for the knowledge Of something thou prepar'st for my destruction, May I not thinke what tis, and kill my selfe? Or at least by degrees, with apprehending Some strange thing done, infect my fancy with Opinion first, and so dispose my selfe To death? I cannot, when I thinke of Gratiana I entertayne a heauen: the worst, Ile heare it. Mar. It will enlarge it selfe too soone, receiue it; I haue enioyd her. Bea. Whom? Mar. Gratiana sinnefully, before your loue Made she and you acquainted. Bea. Ha? th'ast kept thy word thou camst to poison all My comfort. Mar. Your friendship I ha preferred To my owne fame, and but to saue you from A lasting shipwrack, noble Beauford, thinke It should haue rotted here, she that will part With Virgin honour, nere should wed the heart. Bea. Was euer woman good, and Gratiana Vitious? lost to honour? at the instant When I expected all my Haruest ripe, The golden Summer tempting me to reape The well growne eares, comes an impetuous storme Destroyes an ages hope in a short minute, And lets me liue, the copy of mans frailty: Surely, some one of all the female sexe, Engrost the vertues, and fled hence to Heauen, Left woman-kind dissemblers. Mar. Sir, make vse Of reason, tis a knowledge should reioyce you, Since it does teach you to preserue your selfe. Bea. Enioyd Gratiana sinnefully, tis a sound Able to kill with horror; it infects The very aire, I see it like a mist Dwell round about, that I could vncreate My selfe, or be forgotten, no remembrance That euer I lou'd woman: I haue no Genius left to instruct meâit growes late: Withinâ Waite o'my kinsman to his Chamber, I shall desire your rest, pray giue me leaue To thinke a littleâ Mar. Cosen: I repent I haue beene so open breasted, since you make This seuere vse on't, and afflict your minde With womanish sorrow, I haue but caution'd you Against a danger, out of my true friendship: Prosper me goodnesse as my ends are noble: Good-night, collect your selfe, and be a man. Exit. Bea. And why may not a kinsman be a Vilaine? Perhaps he loues Gratiana, and enuying My happinesse, doth now traduce her chastity To find this out, time will allow but narrow Limits: His last words bad me be a man. A man? yes I haue my soule, t'does not become A manly resolution to be tame thus, And giue vp the opinion of his mistresse For one mans accusation;âha: ith'morning? Proper. Yes Marwood I will be a man: His sword, shall eyther make past the sence Of this affliction, or mine enforce A truth from him, if thou beest wrongd Gratiana Ile dye thy Martyr, but if false, in this I gayne to dye, not liue a sacrifice.

Enter Beauford and Marwood. Mar. Was this your purpose. Bea. This place of all the Park affords most priuacy. Nature has plac'd the trees to imitate A Roman Amphitheater. Mar. We must be the sword-players. Bea. Draw, imagine all These trees were Cypresse, the companions of Our funerall, for one or both must go To a darke habitation, me-thinkes We two, are like to some vnguided men, That hauing wandred all the day in a Wild vnknowne path, at night walke downe into A hollow grot, a caue which neuer Starre Durst looke into, made in contempt of light By nature, which the Moone did neuer yet Be-friend with any melancholy beame: Oh Cosen thou hast led me, where I neuer Shall see day more. Mar. This is the way to make it A night indeede, but if you recollect Your selfe, I brought you beames to let you see The horror of that darknesse you are going to, By marrying with Gratiana. Bea. That name Awakes my resolution, consume not Thy breath too idly, th'ast but a small time For th'use on't, eyther employ it in the vnsaying Thy wrong to Gratiana, or thou hastens Thy last minute. Mar. I must tell Beauford then, He is vngratefull to returne so ill My friendship, haue I vnder-valued My shame in the relation of a truth, To make the man I woo'd preserue, my enemy: Why dost thou tempt thy destiny with so Much sinne? dost thinke I were a sword I dare Not manage? or that I can be inforc'd To a reuolt? I am no Rebell Beauford: Againe I must confirme Gratianaes honour Stain'd, the treasures of her chastity Rifled, and lost, twas my vnhappinesse To haue added that, vnto my other sinnes Ith'wildnesse of my blood, which thou mayst punish. Bea. Thou hast repeated, but the same in Substance touching Gratiana. Mar. Truth is euer constant Remaines vpon her square, firme, and vnshaken. Beau. If what thou hast affirm'd be true, why should We fight, be cruell to our selues, indanger Our eternity, for the errour of One frayle woman? let our swords expect A nobler cause. What man hath such assurance In any womans faith, that he should runne A desperate hazard of his soule? I know Women are not borne angels, but created With passion and temper like to vs, And men are apt to erre, and loose themselues Caught with the smile of wanton beauty, fetterd Euen with their mistresses haire. Mar. I like this well. aside. Beau. He has a handsome presence and discourse, Two subtle charmes to tempt a womans frailty, Who must be gouern'd by their eye or eare To loue, beside my kinsman hath beene taxt, For being too prompt in wantonnesse, this confirmes it Then farwell woman kind. Mar. This does become you. Bea. Why should we fight, our letting blood wo'not Cure her, and make her honour white agen: We are friends, repent thy sinne, and marry her. Mar. Whom? Beau. Gratiana. Mar. How sir, marry her? Bea. Why canst thou adde to it another crime, By a refusing to repayre the ruines Of that chast temple, thou hadst violated? Her Virgin tapers are by thee extinct, No odour of her chastity, which once Gaue a perfume to Heauen, and did refresh Her innocent soule, they that haue spoyld virginity, Do halfe restore the treasures they tooke thence By sacred marriage. Mar. Marriage, with whom? Bea. Gratiana. Mar. Should I marry a whore? Bea. Thou lyest, and with a guilt vpon thy soule, Able to sinke thee to damnation, drawes againe. Ile send thee hence; a whore? what woman Was euer bad enough to deserue that name? Salute some natiue fury, or a wretch Condemn'd already to hells tortures by it, Not Gratiana; th'ast awakned iustice, And giuen it eyes to see thy treachery, The depth of thy malicious heart, that word, hath Dis-inchanted me. Mar. Are you serious? Bea. How haue I sin'd in my credulity 'Gainst vertue, all this while? what charme bound vp My vnderstanding part, I should admit A possibility, for her to carry So blacke a soule; though all her sexe beside Had fallen from their creation? thou hast Not life enough to forfeit, what an aduantage To fame and goodnesse had beene lost. Mar. Will you fight? Beau. Wert thou defenc'd with circular fire, more Subtle then the lightning, that I knew would rauish My heart, and marrow from me, yet I should Neglect the danger, and but singly arm'd, Flye to reuenge thy calumny: a whoreâcome on sir. Th'art wounded: ha? Fight. Mar. Mortally, flye Beauford, saue thy selfe, I hasten to the dead. Beau. Oh stay a while, or thou wilt loose vs both, Thy wound I cannot call backe, now there is No dallying with heauen, but thou pulst on thee Double confusion, leaue a truth behind thee, As thou wouldst hope rest to thy parting soule, Hast thou not wrong'd Gratiana? Mar. Yes, in my lust, but not in my report, Take my last breath, I sinfully enioy'd her, One hollows within. Gratiana is a blotted peece of alablaster: Farewell least some betray thee, heauen forgiue My offence, as I do freely pardon thine. Beau. I cannot long suruiue,â Is there no hope thou maist recouer? Mar. Oh! Beau. Farewell for euer then, with thy short breath May all thy ills conclude, mine but beginne To muster, life and I shall quickly part, I feele a sorrow will breake Beaufords heart. Exit.

Grat. Defend me goodnesse! Bea.

A thing I would not name, it sound so fearfully, 'Twould make a Diuell blush, to be saluted By that, which thou must answere to. Grat. I feareâ Bea. That feare betrayes thy guilt, tell me Gratiana What didst thou see in me to make thee thinke I was not worthy of thee, at thy best And richest value, when thou wert as white In soule, as beauty? for sure, once thou wert so: Hadst thou so cheape opinion of my birth, My breeding, or my fortunes, that none else Could serue for propertie of your lust, but I? Grat. Deare Beauford heare me. Bea. A common father to thy sinne-got issue, A patron of thy rifled, vnchast wombe? Oh thou wert cruell, to reward so ill The heart that truely honor'd thee: thy name Which sweetn'd once the breath of him that spake it, And musically charm'd the gentle eare; Shall sound here-after like a Screech-owles note, And fright the hearer; Virgins shall lament That thou hast sham'd their chast society, And oft as Himen lights his tapers vp, At the remembrance of thy name, shed teares, And blush for thy dishonour: from this minute, Thy friends shall count thee desperately sicke, And whensoere thou goest abroad, that day The maides and matrons, thinking thou art dead, And going to the graue, shall all come forth And waite like mourners on thee. Grat. Ha yee done? Then heare me a few sillables, you haue Suspition that I am dishonourd. Bea. No, By heauen I haue not, I haue too much knowledge To suspect thee sinnefull, but in the assurance Of it, I must disclayme thy heart for euer: Gratiana my opinion of thy whitenesse Hath made my soule, as blacke as thine already; Weepe till thou wash away thy staine, and then, Ith'other world, we two, may meete agen. Exit. Grat. Weepe inward eyes, hither your streames impart, For sure, I haue teares enough, to drowne my heart. Exit.</field>

Beau. What, and damme his soule? Shall I thinke any with his dying breath Would shipwracke his last hope? he mixt it with His praiers, when in the streame of his owne blood, His soule was lanching forth. Cap. That circumstance takes away al suspition agen, Where left you Marwood? Bea. I'the Parke. Cap. Quite dead? Beau. Hopelesse, his weapon might haue proued so happy, To haue released me of a burthen too; And but that man-hood, and the care of my Eternity forbids, I would force out That which but wearies me to carry it, Vnwelcome life?

I will not heare an accent, I shall loose My memory, be charmed into beliefe That she is honest with her voyce, I dare not Trust my frailty with her. Cam. She speakes nothing, Is all a weeping Nyobe, a statue, Or in this posture, doth shee not present A water Nymph, placed in the midst of some Faire Garden, like a Fountaine to dispence Her Christal streames vpon the flowers? which cannot But so refresht, looke vp, and seeme to smile Vpon the eyes that feed em: Will she speake?

It had beene sinne That Milisent should suffer you perplexe Your noble soule, when it did consist in His discouery, to giue a freedome To your labouring thoughts, tis now no more a secret, Your father makes a triall of your nature, By giuing him such countenance.

Thou art, and shalt receiue it, for my heart Is willing to discharge it selfe into thee: Oh Milisent! though my father would ha beene So cruell to his owne, to haue wished me marry Him, twas not in the power of me obedience To giue consent to't, for my loue already Is dedicate to one, whose worth hath made Me, but his steward of it, and although His present fortune doth ecclipse his lustre, With seeming condition of a seruant, He has a minde deriued from honour, and May boast himselfe a Gentle-man: is not Thy vnderstanding guilty of the person I point at? sure thou canst not choose but know him.

Hau. Excellent! but in my opinion, you had better giue her possession of your heart, I do not like this owing: fayth plucke it out, and deliuer it in the presence of vs. Raw. Thou talk'st like a puisne, I can giue her possession of it, by deliuery of two-pence wrapt vp in the wax, twill hold in Law man;âand how, and how d'ee like it? I could haue come ouer you with Verse, but hang Ballads, giue me Poeticall prose, euery Mounte-banke can rime, and make his lines crye twang, though there be no reason in em. Ian. What Musique haue I heard? Raw. Musique? Oh rare! Ian.

Raw. What does she meane Iasper? Hau. D'ee not see her loue sir? why she does doate vpon you, Which makes her talke so madly. Raw. Forsooth I know you are taken with me, alas these things are naturall with me, when shall we be married forsooth? Ian. With your licence sirâ Hau.

Thinke on't betweene this and after dinner, I will stay o'purpose for your answere. Ian. Y'are very short. Lod. I wod not be kept in expectation aboue an houre, for loue is worse then a Lent to me, and fasting is a thing my flesh abhorres, if my doublet be not fir'd, I know who fares the worse for't.

Confident of her Vertue Once an admirer, now a mourner for Her absent goodnesse; she has made the change, From her that was, would ha become this paper Had she conseru'd her first immaculate whitenesse, It had beene halfe prophane, not to salute Her letter with a kisse, and touch it with More veneration then a Sybils leafe; But now all Ceremony must be held A superstition, to the blotted scrole, Of a more stained writerâIle not reade: If vnprepar'd, she win with her Discourse, What must she do, when she has time, and study, To apparrell her defence? Cap. Deny her this. Beau. Well, I will read it. Enter Seruant. Ser. Here's Sir Iohn Belfare. Beau. Say any thing t'excuse me, beet your care That none approach the Chamber. Cap.

Does not he call my young mistresse whore? Bel. Keep me not from him Captaine, he has in this Giuen a fresh wound, I came t'expostulate, The reason of a former suffering, Which vnto this was charity, as thou art A Gentle-man, I dare thee to the Combate: Contemne not Beauford my gray haires, if t'hast A Noble soule, keepe not this distance; meete me, Thou art a Souldier: for heauens sake, permit me Chastise the most vncharitable slander Of this bad man. Beau. I neuer iniur'd you. Bel. Not iniur'd me? what is there then in nature, Left, to be cald an iniury? didst not mocke Me, and my poore fond girle with marriage? Till all things were design'd, the very day When Hymen should haue worne his saffron robe: My friends inuited, and prepar'd to call Her Bride; and yet, as if all this could not (Summ'd vp together) make an iniury: Does thy corrupted soule at last conspire To take her white name from her?âgiue me leaue To expresse a Father, in a teare, or two, For my wrong'd child. O Beauford! thou hast rob'd A father, and a daughterâbut I wo not Vsurpe heauens iustice, which shall punish thee 'Boue my weake arme; mayst thou liue, to haue Thy heart as ill rewarded, to be a father At my yeares, haue one daughter, and no more Belou'd as mine, so mock'd, and then cald Whore.

Captaine is she dead? Cap. I hope shee employd not me, to bring this newes. Beau. Yes, Deathâha? Prethee read the rest; there's something In my eyes, I cannot well distinguish Her small Characters. Cap. My Accuser by this time, knowes the reward of my iniury: Farewell, I am carrying my Prayers for thee to another Worldâ her owne Martyr, drown'd Gratiana. Beau. Read all. Cap. I haue. Beau. It cannot be, for when thou mak'st an end, My heart should giue a tragicke period, And with a loud sigh breake: drown'd! Twas no sinne aboue heauens pardon, Though thou hadst beene false, To thy first vow, and me, I wod not had Thee dyed so soone: or if thou hadst affected That death, I could ha'drownd thee with my teares, Now they shall neuer find thee, but be lost Within thy watery Sepulcher. Cap. Take comfort. Beau. Art dead? Then here ile Coffin vp my selfe, vntill The Law vnbury me for Marwoods death, I wonot hope for life, mercy sha'not saue Him, that hath now a pattent for his Graue.

Enter Captayne. Nephew, I ha newes for you. Cap. For mee sir. Iust. You are a Souldier, there's a duell to Be fought this morning, will you see't? Cap. It does not sir become a Gentle-man To be spectator of a fight, in which Hee's not engag'd. Iust. You may behold it Cosen, Without disparagement to your honor; Rawbone Has challeng'd Mr. Lodam, the place Finsburyâ. Cap. They fight? a doublet, stuft with straw, aduancing A bull-rush, were able to fright em both Out a'their sences, tha'not soule enough To skirmish with a field-mouse; they poynt a duell? At Hogs-don, to shew fencing vpon Creame And cake-bread, murder a quaking Custard, Or some such daring enemy. Iust. Did not Affaires of weight compell me to be absent, I would not misse the sight, on't; for the Vsurer Hath got his man Iasper t'appeare for him In his apparrell, Cap. Iasper. Iust. For mirths sake You may behold it, and let mee entreate, At your returne, perfect relation Of both their valours. Cap. You shall Sir. Iust. And Cozeâ If it be possible, procure em hither Before they shift, I much desire to see em. Cap. Promise your selfe they shall: I will deferre My conference with Gratiana, and Intertayne this recreation. Iust. So: I haue a fancy, This opportunity will giue it birth, If all hit right, it may occasion mirth. Exit. Enter Milisent, and Gratiana. Grat. Which part of my discourse compels thee to This suffering? Mil. Your pardon Lady, I Did prophesie what now I finde, our stories Haue dependance. Grat. How prethee? Mil. That Marwood Whom you report thus wounded had a neere Relation to me, and twas my fortune To come to close his eyes vp, and receiue His last breath. Grat. Ha? Mil. I know more then Beauford, And dying he oblieg'd my loue to tell t'him When ere wee met. Grat. You beget wonder in me: Did he suruiue his slander? there is hope He did recant the iniury he did me. Mil. He did confirme, he had enioy'd your person, And bad me tell Beauford hee left behind A liuing witnesse of the truth he dyed for: Naming a Gentle-woman Cardona, That bred you in your fathers house, whom he Affirm'd, betray'd your body to his lust. Grat. Cardona? Piety has forsaken earth: Was euer woman thus betray'd to sinne, Without her knowledge? Mil. Wo'd he had not beene My kinsman, I beginne to feare him: Grat. Wherein had I offended Marwood, He should aliue, and dead so persecute My fame? Cardona too i'the Conspiracy, Tis time to dye then. Mil. My heart mournes for you In the assurance of your innocence, And were I worthy to direct youâ Grat. Has, malice Found out another murderer? Mil. Would you be pleas'd to heare me, I could poynt You out a path, would bring you no repentance To walke in, if (as I am confident) Your goodnesse feares not, what Cardona can Accuse your honour with, let her be Examin'd, then her knowledge will quit you, Or make your suffering appeare iust, this is An easie triall, and since Marwood had A stubborne soule, for though he were my kins-man I preferre iustice, and held shame to checke His owne report, women haue softer natures, And things may be so manag'd, if there be A treason, to enforce confession from her: Would you please t'imploy me in this seruice, And though vnworthy be directed by me, I begge it from you, ile engage my being You shall finde comfort in't. Grat. Doe any thing; But I am lost already. Mil. You much honour me. Exeunt. Enter Lodam, and Cameleon. Lod. Cam, see and if he be come yet, bring mee word hither. Cam. I see one lying o'the groundâ Lod. Is there so? lets steale way before we be discouered, I do not like when men lye perdue, beside, there may be three or foure of a heape, for ought we know: lets backe I say. Cam. Tis a horse. Lod. Hang him iade, I knew it could bee nothing else: is the coast cleare Cameleon? Cam. I see nothing but fiue or sixe. Lod. Fiue or sixe: treachery! an ambush, tis valour to runne. Cam. They bee Wind-mills. Lod. And yet, thou wod'st perswade me, twas an ambush for me. Cam. I? Lod. Come thou wert afraide, and the truth were knowne; but be valiant: I haue a sword; and if I doe draw, it shallâbe against my will: is he not come yet? Cam. And hee were betweene this and More-gate, you might sent him. Lod. If he come, some-body shall smell all fauouredly, ere he and I part:âha! by this flesh tis he; Cam, go tell him I am sicke. Enter Hauer, Rawbone, (hauing chang'd cloathes) Captaine. Hau. Master Lodam. Lod. A brace of bullets to my heart. Cap. Here can I stand and behold the Champions. Lod. I haue expected you this two houres, which is more then I ha done to all the men I ha fought withall, since I slew the high Germaine in Tutle. Cap. Whorson, moale-cather. Lod. Draw Spider. Cap. Well slye toade. Hau. Let vs conferre a little. Lod. Conferre me no conferrings: I will haue no more mercy on thee, then an Infidell; and t'hadst beene wise, thou mightest ha kept thee at home, with thy melancholy Cat, that keepes thy Study, with whom thou art in Commons, and doest feede on Rats a Sundayes; then perhaps a legge or an arme, with thy Iewes eares had satisfied me, when I met thee next: draw I say, why doest not draw? Hau. I come to giue you satisfaction. Lod. What with words? Sirra Tartar, my Foxe shall scratch thy guts out, which I will send to the Beare-Garden: Doest heare Vsuring dog, ile tell thee my resolution. I doe meane to giue thee as many Wounds before I kill thee, as a Surgeons signe has; and when I am weary of skarrifying thy flesh, ile bore thy heartâwhich done: mark what I say; I will diuide thy quarters: obserue and tremble; then will I ha thee put into a tub or Barrell, and powder thee, and after three dayes in pickle, this thing that was thy seruant, this Cacodemon whom thou didst starue once, Cameleon, shall in reuenge of his pityfull famine, eate thee vp, deuoure thee, and grow fat i'the ribs agen with thy flesh, Mammonâ Cam. I hungrily thanke your Worship. Raw. What haue I scapt? aside. Lod. Which is more, after thou art dead, I wonot leaue thy soule quiet, ile torment thy Ghost: for I will streight to thy house where I will breake open thy Chests, lin'd with white and yellow mettle, which I will cast away on pious vses: then summon all thy debtors by a Drum, and giue em in, all their Bills, Bonds, Euidences, Indentures, Defesances, Morgages, Statutes. Raw. I shall be vndone.â Lod. And there were a million on em. Raw. Ile home, and shut vp my doores, for feare he kill Iasper and vse me so indeede. Cap. If thou doest offer to looke home agen, till they ha done, ile cut thee off at thigh. Raw. Ahâ Lod. Draw I say. Hau. Since there is no remedy. Lod. His sword appeares Cam. Cam. If he were a coward you were able to coniure a spirit into him, with those threatnings. Lod. Pox a'my dulnes: dost heare scoundrell, if I should incline to mercy, what submission? ha? let mee seeâI, I, liue, thou shalt vpon thy knees confesse thy rascality, and aske me forgiuenesse in priuate, in the presence of mistresse Iane, and the twelue Companies which at thy charge shalbe feasted that day, in More-fields. Hau. That must not be. Lod. Then say when thou art dead, thou wert offred conditions for thy life: Cam, thou shalt feed, and feed high Cameleon,â let me see;âcome tis my foolish nature to ha compassion o'thee, I know th'art sorry, shat onely confesse thy selfe a rascall vnder thy hand then, and stay my in ended reuenge which else would ha beene immortall. Hau. Let me consider. Lod. Oho Cam.â Cap. Both cowards, we shall haue no skirmish. Raw. Now I thinke on't, what if my man Iasper, should be valiant and kill Lodamâumh? what pickle were I in: worse-worse, hee'le runne away, I shall bee taken Puls Hauer, by the sleeue. and hang'd for the Conspiracy. AhâIasper, rogue that I was, where were my braines to challenge himâhe wonot heareâa stubborne knaue, he lookes as if he meant to kill: ah Iasper. Cap. I ha seene a dogge looke like him, that has drawne a Wicker bottle, ratling about the streetes, and leering on both sides, where to get a quiet corner to bite his tayle off. Raw. I doe imagine my selfe apprehended already: now the Constable is carrying me to New-gateânow, now. Ime at the Sessions house, i'the Docke:ânow I'me caldânot guilty my Lord:âthe Iury has found the inditement Billa veraâ now, now comes my sentence. Hau. I am resolu'd sir. Raw. Ha.â Hau. You shall haue what acknowledgement, this pen of steele will draw out in your flesh, with red inke, and no other, deare master Lodam. Lod. How? Cap. So, so. Raw. Now I'me i'the Cart, riding vp Holborne in a two wheel'd Chariot, with a guard of Halberdiers: there goes a proper fellow sayes one: good people pray for me: now I am at the three Wodden stilts.â Lod. Is this Rawbone the Coward? Doest heare thingâconsider what thou doest, come among friends, thy word shall bee as good as a note vnder thy hand, tempt not my furyâwod I were off, with asking him forgiuenesse. Raw. Hey! now I feele my toes hang i'the Cart: Now tis drawne away, now, now, now, I am goneâ turnes about. Hau. You must shew your fencing. Lod. Hold: I demaund a parlee. Hau. How? Lod. Tis not for your reputasion to deale with a Gentle-man vpon vnequall termes. Hau. Where lye the oddes? Cap. Howe's this? Lod. Examine our bodies: I take it I am the fairer marke, tis a disaduantage: feede til you be as fat as I, and ile fight w'ee as I am a Gentle-man. Hau. It shanot serue your turne. Fight. Lod. Hold, murder, murder. Raw. I'm dead, I'm dead. Cap. Whorson puffe-paste, how he winkes and barkes: How now Gentle-men, master Lodam. Lod. Captayne, shud a come but a little sooner, and ha seene good sport, by this flesh hee came vp handsomely to me; a pritty sparke saith Captayne. Hau. How sir? Lod. But if you be his friend, runne for a Surgeon for him, I haue hurt him vnder the short ribs, beside a cut or two ith' shoulder: would I were in a Millars sacke yonder, though I were ground for't, to be quit on em. Hau. You wonot vse me thus? Lod. I were best deliuer my sword ere I be compeld too't.â a pritty fellow, and one that will make a souldier, because I see th'ast a spirit, and canst vse thy Weapon, ile bestow a dull blade vppon thee Squirrell. Cap. Deliuer vp your Weapon: Lod. In loue in loue Captaine, hee's a sparke a my reputation, and worthy your acquaintance. Hau. Thou mully-puffe, were it not iustice to kicke thy guts out. Lod. When I am dis-arm'd. Hau. Take't, agen you spungeâ Lod. What? when I haue geent thee: tis at thy seruice, and it were a whole Cutlers shop: be confident. Raw. My Agur has not left mee yet, there's a grudging a the halter still: Cap. Master Rawbone, I repent my opinion of your Cowardize. I see you dare fight, and shall report it to my Cosen: You shall walke home, shee'le take it as an honor, And present your prisoner. Raw. Iasper, lets go home and shift, do not goâhonest Iasper. Hau. You will be pratling sirraâIle waite vpon you Captayne: Master Lodamâ Lod. I will accompany thee, th'art noble, and fit for my conuersation, honest master Rawboneâa poxe vpon you. Cap. Nay, you shal waite a'your master with his leaue, good Iasper Hau. How now Iasper? Exeunt. Musicke: A Table set forth with two Tapers: Seruants placing Ewe, Bayes, and Rosemary, &amp;c. Enter Beauford. Beau. Are these the hearbes you strow at Funerals. Seruant. Yes sir. Beau. Tis well, I commend your care, And thanke yee; yee haue exprest more duty In not enquiring wherefore I commaund This strange employment, there in the very Act of your obedience: my chamber Lookes like the Spring now? ha'yee not arte enough To make this Ewe tree grow here, or this Bayes? The embleme of our victory in Death? But they present that best when they are wither'd: Haue you beene carefull that no day breake in At any Window, I would dwell in night, And haue no other star-light but these tapers: Ser. If any aske to speake with you, Shall I say, you are abroad. Beau. No, to all do enquire with busie faces Pale or disturb'd, giue free accesse. Exit ser. What do I differ from the dead? would not Some fearefull man or woman seeing me, Call this a Church-yard, and imagine me Some wakefull apparition 'mong the graues; That for some treasures buried in my life, Walke vp and downe thus? buried? no twas drownd, I cannot therefore say, it was a chest, Gratiana had nere a Coffin, I haue one Spacious enough for both on's, but the waues Will neuer yeeld too't, for it may bee they Soone as the northerne Wind blowes cold vppon em, Will freeze themselues to marble ouer her, Least she should want a tombe: Enter Keeper. Thy businesse. Keeper. Hee dyed this morning: A friend of his and yours did practise on him A little Surgery, but in vayne; his last Breath did forgiue you: but you must expect No safety from the Law: my seruice sir. Beau. I haue left direction, that it cannot misse me: And hadst thou come to apprehend me for't? With as much ease thou mightst; I am no states-man Officious, seruants makes no sutors waite My doores vnguarded; tis no laborinth I dwell in; but I thanke thy loue, there's something To reward it: iustice cannot put on A shape to fright me. Keeper. I am sorry sir, Your resolution carries so much danger. Exit. Beau. What can life bring to me, that I should court it: There is a period in nature, ist not Better to dye and not be sicke; worne in Our bodies, which in imitation Of ghosts, grow leane, as if they woo'd at last Be immateriall too; our blood turne ielly And freeze in their cold channell, let mee expire While I haue heat and strength to tug with death For Victory. Enter Milisent. Mil. You may disburden there, But gently, tis a chest of value, mistresseâ Ile giue him notice, where is Beauford? Beau. Heere. Mil. What place d'ee call this? Beau. Tis a Bridall chamber. Mil. It presents horrour. Beau. Ha you anything To say to me? Mil. Yes. Beau. Proceede. Mil. I come to visite you. Beau. You are not welcome then. Mil. I did suspect it, and haue therefore brought My assurance wo'me, I must require Satisfaction for a kinsmans death, One Marwood. Beau. Ha? Mil. Your valour was not noble, It was a course reward to kill him for His friendship: I come not with a guard of Officers to attach your person, it Were too poore and formall, the instrument That sluc'd his soule out, I had rather shud Sacrifice to his ashes, and my sword Shall do't, or yours be guilty of another, To waite vppon his ghost. Beau. Young man be not Too rash without the knowledg how our quarrel Rise to procure thy selfe a danger. Mil. Make it Not your feare, I haue heard the perfect story, And ere I fight with thee shat see thy errour; Acknowledge thou hast kild a friend, I bring A perspectiue to make those things that lye Remote from sence, familiar to thee, nay Thou shat confesse thou knowst the truth of what Concernes him, or Gratiana. Beau. When my soule Throwes off this vpper Garment, I shall know all. Mil. Thou shat not number many minutes, know 'Twas my mis-fortune to close vp the eyes Of Marwood, whose body I vow'd neuer Should to the earth without reuenge; or mee Companion to his graue: I ha therefore brought it Hither, tis in this house. Beau. Ha? Mil. His pale corpes Shall witnesse my affection. Bea. Thou didst promise To informe me of Gratiana. Mil. And thus briefly: Marwood reueal'd at death another witnesse Of his truth, for Cardona hee corrupted To betray Gratiana to him. Beau. Ha Cardona! Heauen continue her among the liuing, But halfe an houre. Mil. I ha sau'd yee trouble, Shee waites without, in your name I procur'd Her presence, as you had affaires with her She's vnprepar'd, a little terrour will Enforce her to confesse the truth of all things. Beau. Thou doest direct well. Mil. Still remember Beauford I am thy enemy, and in this doe but Prepare thy conscience of misdeede to Meete my iust anger. Bea. I am all wonder. Milisent bring in Cardona. Mil. He's now at opportunity. Car. Sir you sent To speake with me. Beau. Come neerer, I heare say You are a Baud; tell me how goe Virgins I'th sinfull market: nay I must know hell-cat What was the price you tooke for Gratianaes: Did Marwood come off roundly with his wages Tell me the truth, or by my fathers soule Ile digge thy heart out. Car. Helpe. Beau. Let me not heare A syllable that has not referrence To my questionâorâ Car. Ile tell you sir: Marwoodâ Beau. So. Car. Did vitiously affect her: Won with his gifts and flatteries, I promis'd My assistance, but I knew her vertue was not To bee corrupted in a thought. Beau. Ha. Car. Thereforeâ Beau. What d'ee studyâ Car. HoldâI would deliuer The rest into your care, it is too shamefull To expresse it louder then a whisperâ Mil. With what vnwillingnes, we discouer things Wee are asham'd to owne: Cardona shudst Ha vs'd but halfe this feare in thy consent. And thou hadst nere beene guilty of a sinne Thou art so loath to part with though it be A burden to thy soule: how boldly would Our innocence plead for vs; but shas done. Beau. Then was Gratianaes honor sau'd. Car. Vntouch'd. Bea. Where am I lost: this story is more killing Then all my iealousies: Oh Cardona Goe safe from hence, but when thou com'st at home, Locke thy selfe vp and languish, till thou dye Thou shalt meete Marwood, in a gloomy shade, Giue backe this salary, Exit Cardona. Mil. Haue I made good My promise, do you finde your errour. Beau. No I ha found my horrorâhas the chast And innocent Gratiana drown'd her selfe? What satisfaction can I pay thy ghost? Mil. Now doe me right sir. Beau. Shee's gone for euer, And can the earth still dwell a quiet neighbour To the rough Sea, and not it selfe bee thaw'd Into a riuer; let it melt to waues From hence-forth, that beside th'inhabitants, The very Genius of the World may drowne, And not accuse me for her: Oh Gratiana. Mil. Reserue your passion, and remember what I come for. Beau. How shall I punish my vniust suspition? Death is too poore a thing to suffer for her: Some spirit guide mee where her body lyes Within her watery vrne, although seal'd vp With frost, my teares are warme and can dissolue it, To let in mee, and my repentance to her, I would kisse her cold face into life agen Renew her breath with mine, on her pale lip I do not thinke, but if some artery Of mine were open'd, and the crimson flood Conuay'd into her veines, it would agree And with a gentle gliding steale it selfe Into her heart, inlif'ne her dead faculties, And with a flattery, tice her soule agen, To dwell in her faire tenement. Mil. You loose Your selfe in these wild fancies; recollect And doe mee iustice. Beau. I am lost indeede, With fruitlesse passion: I remember thee And thy designe agen; I must account For Marwoods death ist not? alas thou art Too young, and canst not fight, I wish thou wert A man of tough and actiue sinewes, for Thy owne reuenge sake, I would prayse thee for My death, so I might fall but nobly by thee: For I am burden'd with a weight of lifeâ Stay, didst not tell me thou hadst brought hither The body of young Marwoodâ Mil. Yes. Beau. Since a mistake, not malice did procure His ill fate, I will but drop one funerall Teare vpon his wound, and soone finish To doe thee right. Mil. Yee shall. A coffin brought in. Beau. Does this enclose his corpes? how little roome Doe wee take vp in death, that liuing, know No bounds? here without murmurring wee can Be circumscrib'd, it is the soule, that makes vs Affect such wanton, and irregular pathes; When that's gone, wee are quiet as the earth, And thinke no more of wandring: oh Marwood Forgiue my anger, thy confession did Inuite thy ruine from me, yet vpponâ Opens. My memory forsake me, tis Gratiana's Spirit, hast thou left thy Heauenly dwelling To call me hence? I was now comming to thee: Or but commaund more hast, and I will count it No sinne to strike my selfe, and in the streame Of my owne blood to imitate how thou Didst drowne thy selfe. Grat. I am liuing Beauford. Beau. I know thou art immortall. Grat. Liuing as thou art. Beau. Good angels doe not mocke mortality. Grat. And cameâ Beau. To call me to my answere how I durst Suspect thy chastity, ile accuse my selfe And to thy iniur'd innocence giue me vp A willing sacrifice. Grat. Oh my Beauford, now I am ouer-blest for my late sufferings; I haue sollicited my Death with prayers: Now I would liue to see my Beauford loue me. It was thy friend induc'd me to that letter, To finde if thy suspition had destroy'd All seedes of loue. Beau. Art thou not dead indeede, May I beleeue? her hand is warme,âshee breathes Agenâand kisses as she wont to doe Her Beauford, art Gratiana? Heauen Let me dwell here vntill my soule exhale. Mil. One sorrow's cur'd Milisent begone, Thou hast bin too long absent from thy owne. Exit. Bea. Oh my ioy rauisht soule, but where's the youth Brought mee this blessing? vanisht Gratiana Where is hee? I would hang about his necke And kisse his cheeke, he wonot leaue me so: Gone? sure it was some angell, was hee not, Or doe I dreame this happinesse, wot not thou Forsake mee to? Grat. Oh neuer. Beau. Within thereâ Bid the young man returne, and quickly, loast My ioy aboue the strength of natures sufferance, Kill me before I can expresse my gratitude: Ha yee brought him? Enter Officers. Officer. Mr. Beauford, I am sorry wee are Commanded to apprehend your person. Grat. Officers ha? Officer. You are suspected to haue slaine a Gentle-man, one Marwood. Beau. Haue I still my essence ha? I had a ioy was able to make man Forget he could be miserable. Officer. Come sir. Beau. If ere extreamities did kill, wee both Shall dye this very minute. Grat. You shanot goe. Officers. Our authority will force him. Grat. Y'are villaines, murderers: Oh my Beauford! Beau. Leaue me Gratiana. Grat. Neuer, ile dye with thee. Beau. What can wee say vnto our misery, Sau'd in a tempest that did threaten most, Arriu'd the harbour, ship, and all are lost. Officer. To the next Iustice. Exeunt.</field>

Sir, you haue charity, beleeue em not, They doe conspire to take away his life. Keeper. May it please you vnderstand, he has kild A Gentle-man, one Marwood, in our Parke, I found him wounded mortally, though before He dyed, he did confesse. Beau. Vrge it no farther, Ile saue the trouble of examination, And yeeld my selfe vp guilty. Grat. For heauens sake Beleeue him not, hee is an enemy To his owne life; deare Beauford, what d'ee meane To cast your selfe away, y'are more vnmercifull Then those that doe accuse you, then the Law It selfe, for at the worst, that can but finde You guilty at the last, too soone for me To bee deuided from you. Beau. Oh Gratiana, I call heauen to witnesse, Though my mis-fortune made mee thinke before, My life a tedious and painefull trouble, My very soule a luggage, and too heauy For me to carry, now I wish to liue, To liue for thy sake, till my haire were siluer'd With age; to liue till thou wodst ha me dye, And wert a weary of me: For I neuer Could by the seruice of one life, reward Enough thy loue, nor by the suffering The punishment of age and time, do pennance Sufficient for my iniury, but my fate Hurries me from thee, then accept my death A satisfaction for that sinne, I could not Redeeme aliue, I cannot but confesse The accusation. Enter Sir Iohn Belfare, and Isaac. Bel. Iustice, iustice, I will haue iustice: Ha Gratiana! Grat. Oh my deare fatherâ Bel. Art a liue, oh my ioy, it growes To mighty for me, I must weepe a little To saue my heartâ Isa. My young mistresse aliue. Exit Grat. If euer you lou'd Gratiana, plead for Beauford, H'as beene abus'd, by a villaine, alls discouer'd, W'aue renew'd hearts, and now I feare, I shall Loose him agen, accus'd here for the death Of Marwood, that was cause of all our suffering. Bel. I ha not wept enough for ioy Gratiana That th'art aliue yetâI vnderstand nothing Beside this comfort. Grat. Deere sir recollect, And second me. Iust. The fact confest, all hope Wilbe a pardon sir may be procur'd: Sir Iohnây'are come in a sad time. Grat. What is the worst you charge him with? Keeper. He has slaine a Gentle-man. Iust. No common trespasse. Grat. He has done iustice. Iust. How? Grat. A publicke benefite to his Country in't. Iust. Killing a man? her sorrow ouer-throwes Her reason. Grat. Heare me, Marwood was a Villaine, A rebell vnto vertue, a prophaner Of friendships sacred lawes, a murderer Of virgin chastity, against whose malice No innocence could hope protection; But like a Bird grip'd by an Eagles talent, It growning dyes. What punishment can you inflict on him, That in contempt of nature, and religion, Inforces breach of loue, of holy vowes? Sets them at warre, whose hearts were married In a full congregation of Angels: I know you will not say, but such deserue To dye yet Marwood being dead, you reach Your fury to his heart, that did this benefit. Beau. Oh Gratiana if I may not liue To enioy thee here, I would thou hadst beene dead Indeede, for in a little time, we shu'd Ha met each other in a better World; But since I go before thee, I will carry Thy playse along, and if my soule forget not, What it hath lou'd, when it conuerst with men, I will so talke of thee among the blest, That they shalbe in loue with thee, and descend In holy shapes, to woe thee to come thither, And be of their society doe no veile thy beauty With such a shower, keepe this soft raine, To water some more lost, and barren garden, Least thou destroy the spring, which nature made To be a wonder in thy cheeke Iust. Where is Marwoods body? Mar. Here sir. Omnes. A liue! Mil. Ha Marwood? Mar. A liue, as glad to see thee, as thou art To know thy selfe acquitted or my death; Which I of purpose by this honest friend, To whose cure, I owe my life, made you beleeue, T'increase our ioy at meeting: for you Lady, You are a woman,âyet you might ha beene Lesse violent in your pleading, do not Engage me past respects of mine, or your own honor. Grat. Mine is aboue thy malice, I haue a breast Impenetrable, 'gainst which, thou fondly ayming, Thy arrowes, but recoile into thy bosome, And leaue a wound. Beau. Friend we haue found thy errourâ Mar. Let it be mine, we haue had stormes already. Grat. Tell me iniurious man for in this presence You must acquit the honour you accus'd, Discharge thy poyson here, inhumane Traytorâ Beau. Thou wo't aske her now forgiuenes, she's al chastitie. Mar. Why d'ee tempt me thus? Bel. It was ill done sirâ Iust. Accuse her to her face. Mar. So so, you see, I am silent still. Gra. You are too ful of guilt to excuse your trechery. Mar. Then farwell all respects, and heare me tell This bold and insolent woman, that so late Made triumph in my death. Mil. Oh sir proceede not, You do not declare your selfe of generous birth, Thus openly to accuse a Gentle-woman, Were it a truth. Grat. He may throw soyle at heauen, And as soone staine it. Mar. Sirra boy, who made you so peremptory He would be whipt. Mil. With what? I am not arm'd You see, but your big language would not fright My youth, were it be friended with a sword; You should find then I would dare to proue it A false hood, on your person. Iust. How now Milisent? Mar. Hath my loue made mee thus ridiculous? Beauford, that you will suffer such a boy To affront me? then against all the world I rise an enemy, and defie his valour Dares iustifie Gratiana vertuous. Enter Isaac, and Cardona. Isa. Beleeue your eyes. Car. My daughter aliue? Oh my deare heart. Mar. You are come opportunely, Cardona speake the truth, as thou wouldst not Eate my poinard, is not Gratiana A sinnefull woman. Mar. What meanes Marwood, ha? Bel. I am in a laborinth? Car. Hold, I confesseâ You neuer did enioy Gratiana. Mar. Ha? Car. Let not our shame be publicke, sir, you shall Haue the whole truth, oh that my teares were able To wash my sinne awayâwon with your promises, I did, in hope to make my self a fortune, And get a husband for my childe, with much Blacke oratoury, woe my daughter to Supply Gratianaes bed, whom with that Circumstance, you enioy'd, that you beleeu'd It was the virgin you desir'd. Bel. Ist possible? Mar. I am at a confusion, where's this daughter? Car. She with the feare (as I conceiue) of her Dishonour, taking a few iewels with her, Went from me, I know not whither, by this time Dead, if not more vnhappy in her fortune. Mar. Into how many sinnes hath lust engag'd me? Is there a hope you can forgiue, and you, And she whom I haue most dishonor'd I neuer had a conscience till now, To be grieu'd for her, I will hide my selfe From all the World. Mil. Stay sirâ Grat. You heare this Beauford, fatherâ Beau. This she confest to me, though I conceal'd From thee the errour, Marwood dead, their shame Would not ha giuen my life aduantage, now We haue ore-come the malice of our fare: I hope you'le call me sonne. Bel. Both my lou'd children. Iust. I congratulate your ioy. Mar. Beauford, Gentle-men, This is a woman, Lucibel your daughter, The too much iniur'd maide: oh pardon me, Welcom both to my knowledge, and my heart. Car. Oh my childe. Iust. My seruant prooue a woman? Bel. You'le marry her. Mar. It shall begin my recompence: Lead you to Church, we'le find the Priest more worke. Iust. He has done some already, for by this time I haue a daughter married to young Hauer, That walk'd in Rawbones liuery,âthey'r return'd. Enter Captaine, Hauer, Iane, Lodam, and Cameleon. Hau. Father your pardon, though you meant me not Your sonne, yet I must call your daughter wife: Here I resigne my Citizen. Bel. Young Hauer. Iust. My blessing on you both, I meant it so: a letter tooke off this Disguise before; nay here are more couples, Enough to play at Barly-breakâ. Raw. Master Lodam, you and I are in Hell. Lod. How? Hau. You and I are friends. Lod. I knew by instinct, I had no quarrell to thee: Are thou Rawbone? Raw. I am not drunkeâ Lod. No, but thou art disguis'd shrewdly. Raw.
