      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, SPOKEN BY MR. COOPER. To-night a bard unknown assays his art, By tragic strains to reach the feeling heart: His theme domestick, therefore apt to move The tear that sweet retirement will approve. Though here in crowds you weep, such tears belong To finer movements than the poet's song; To that dear home where fond affections trace Their brightest hope in every well-known face; And, when applying our imagined scene, You feel the more to think—it might have been. Nor can it less affect you, that we tell What miseries a wedded pair befell; And how they fared, e'en to their latest groan, Part by misfortune—part by guilt undone. The guilt the husband's; but the virtue fair— Its proper form—a female form should wear. Courageous tremblers! In the hour of ill, Strong love the place of boldness can fulfil, Advance your souls to act the noblest part, And, while it wrings, invigorate the heart. This picture, too, with trembling hand to try, Our Author takes his chance—nor does he fly To vain excuses—if he fail to shine, His pen was mortal, though the theme divine. One word at parting, in our Author's favour, That not of pride, or meanness, ought to savour: He is unknown, and therefore hopes to find Your temper'd judgment to his feelings kind. He is unknown—the task belongs to you, To draw retiring merit into view: If he has merit, fan the lowly flame; The breath that kindles shall divide his fame. If he has none, to prove it you should lend A candid hearing—hear him to the end. One flattering hope alone he bade me state, That as your power throughout the world is great, Your greatness generous—so with British pride Your hearts will lean to aid the weaker side; Nor in the circuit of these walls alone Refuse to make the stranger's cause your own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Street in Venice. Enter Julio and Rodolpho. Rod. Ah! Signior Julio, 'tis a luckless day For your unhappy friend. Jul. My poor Lorenzo! But still, Rodolpho, consolation springs From knowing thou art friendly to his cause. Rod. Though long the servant of his enemy, My mind was free. Arsenio is my master, But not the master of my thoughts. Jul. Elmira, Thy master's daughter, too, hath claimed the right Inborn of all our race: for shall we see With our own eyes, nor judge with our own minds? She loves the object of her father's hate, More dearly for that hatred. Rod. But in vain Her fondness now. The sentence of the court Hath left Lorenzo at her father's mercy. Jul. 'Tis true the law this day confirms his title To all my friend's possessions:—shame pursue The memory of the wretch whose crimes prepared it. Rod. You mean Rinaldo? Jul. Yes; Arsenio's brother, And one of kindred mould.—Thou didst not know That brother? Rod. He had died some months before My ruined fortunes drove me here to Venice. Jul. They say the dead should rest; but villains rot Unsanctified. Rinaldo was a villain Cast like a blemish on humanity: He was the guardian of Lorenzo's youth:— The guardian, did I say? He robbed the orphan By forged bonds, by oaths he conjured up A fabricated debt against his friend Deceased; and by enticements led the son Into the toils of waste and usury. Thus did he become possessed of all: when, lo! As from repletion of his avarice, The villain died. Rod. Still in Arsenio lives A claimant to his ill got wealth. Jul. He has it; The law has given it him; and the next dawn That peeps from heaven must find Lorenzo wandering Far from his home and love. O! were it not An action worth the honest zeal of virtue To serve the hapless pair? Rod. But how to serve them? Jul. Suppose the power were thine? Rod. The name of power Mocks my condition, sir! Jul. Not so, not so. Thy master's doors are barred against Lorenzo.— Rod. You'd have them opened?— Jul. Only for a moment, But while the quick farewell of parting faith Bursts in a sigh. Rod. Th' attempt were full of danger. Jul. But full of virtue,—full of pride, Rodolpho: It plucks the meanness from the poor man's lot When he aspires to succour misery. Rod. Should I betray my master? Jul. How betray him! Ask I for aught of his? The tears they shed, With your allowance, in each other's sight, Fall not from him, nor to his rights 'pertain: He has abundance of another kind, And need not envy them their sorrow's plenty. Rod. I ought, yet know not to refuse. Then mark me; Within an hour the eastern gate shall stand Ajar; Lorenzo may in safety open; And there the sweetest lips that ever spoke Must bid him long farewell. Jul. Thanks, good Rodolpho. [Exit Rodolpho. And here Lorenzo comes; as yet he knows not The sentence of the court. Enter Lorenzo. Jul. How fares my friend? Lor. That I should ask of thee: What say our judges? Am I to fare as my good cause demands; Or is the current of their wisdom set Against the weak?—Why even the whirlwind blows With terrors more like justice, when it spreads An undiscriminating havock round, Than does the voice of that deliberate knave, Whose angry tone is kept for the defenceless. Nay, come confess my ruin. Jul. 'Tis complete, Unless Arsenio can be moved to spare thee. O! I could curse the villain in his grave Whose arts have led to this. Lor. Curse not the dead. Jul. Not curse Rinaldo? Lor. No. Jul. 'Tis strange, methinks, That you should tremble but to hear him named; And I have noted, that the strong despair Your losses waked, hath doubled since his death, As you a friend lamented. Lor. Talk not thus; Suspicion's ear might catch the sound. Jul. Suspicion! Lor. There are a thousand tapers in the mind, That burn like flax on the least touch of light, And leave the socket foul. He was my foe, I grant you; but he died on my return From classic travel in the isles of Greece. Well; he has done with me, and I with him; And so no more. What may remain of strife, To be adjusted in our after being, Where each can challenge either with his wrongs, Should sleep, as he does, 'till the graves shall open, And the cold populace of buried nations Stalk to the general doom. Jul. If such thy wish, So let it be: but for thy future course On what hast thou resolved? Lor. The Turkish war Is ended; no destruction offers there; But inborn foes, a fierce banditti, rage, And by the state high honours are decreed To such advent'rous spirits, as shall crush The desperate band. Our noblest youth in arms Contest the prize: 't were well to die amongst them. Jul. I hope some happier turn: and now to think Of love! I parted from Rodolpho just As you approached, who to my suit has granted— Lor. What? Jul. That the gate, which looks upon the east, But leads to brighter charms enshrined within,— I mean the beauty of Arsenio's daughter,— Shall open soon, nor close 'till thou hast closed it. Lor. How!—are my stars so kind? Jul. Within the hour Thou'lt prove their brightest influence. Lor. Then come. Jul. 'Twere yet too soon. Lor. But from the public way I would retire; and from the heartless whine Of seeming friends: there is a cant condolence, Which gives more pain to the afflicted mind Than open scorn. I have been so bepitied By rascals at the moment measuring Their height above me with an eye as cold As frost, if frost could feel the cold it scatters— By heaven! I rather would endure the taunts Of my worst enemy.—Come, from our friends. [Exeunt. SCENE II. An Apartment in Arsenio's House. Enter Arsenio and Elmira. Elm. But hear me, father. Ar. Peace! Elmira, peace! Thou know'st I hate Lorenzo, who in court Denied my claims. I cast the fool; and now Thy hand, thy heart, shall follow his possessions, And in another find a nobler mate. Elm. Another? Ar. Yes; the young, the noble Galza. Elm. To love!—am I to love him? Ar. If you hold A father's blessing in due reverence. Elm. Why mix that blessing with so great a curse? Ar. Why spurn a noble's hand? Elm. 'Twere perjury To touch it.—I have sworn:—there 's not a power That sheds an influence of good, or ill, On this wide earth, but was my witness then. O! I have sworn an oath so desperate; My soul, my precious soul, hath staked the hope Of its salvation on the constancy With which it loves Lorenzo! Nay, my father, Prepare not to reject me; frown not on me; Remember once you bade me love him too, And I have loved beyond the dear command. I disobey you in obedience, For what you ordered to give, I gave him, Never to be recalled. Ar. This to my face! Elm. The truth cannot offend. Ar. How! not offend! I tell thee—Grant me patience, Heaven! the truth Thou speak'st of, is device, imposture feigned To thwart my views: but were it true, nay sworn In the observable presence of the angel Of truth herself, it should not weigh with me:— Denying thee the power to keep thine oath, I do discharge thee of the obligation. Thou canst not, that thou shalt not— Elm. Hear me, sir. Ar. No more. Elm. Grant me but one request—to live In unmolested maidhood, and Lorenzo Shall never call me his, if thou wilt own me. Ask I too much for reason, when my heart Foregoes its natural privilege of choice, And only craves that others may not claim The right extinguished thus, but not imparted? O! think of mercy; think of that, and yield. Ar. Would'st thou with words unfix my firm resolve? If in the cavern where the winds reside You prais'd the light-winged zephyr;—would the winds Pluck their rough pinions bare; retrench their throats; Discard their sovereign thunders; and steal out To fall in love with evening's golden sky, And play with blossoms in the orange grove? Neither will I from my prerogative Descend, at thy entreaty. Elm. O! my father, Have patience—think again—resolve to-morrow. Ar. I leave thee to reflect; thou know'st my will. If you refuse to wed, as child and parent We meet no more. [Exit Arsenio. Elm. Ha! meet no more! he said so:— Then I am lost, abandoned—but my vows, They shall be kept as pure—lend me, thou great One, The brave religion of the martyr's heart; Support my courage to be true to that Which I have sworn; to him whose virtues first Advised me of his charms, and led on, Through admiration, into love. Enter Rodolpho. Elm. Rodolpho, And art thou come to hear my sad complaining? Rod. To bring relief, dear lady: follow me: Within the hall Lorenzo waits to soothe The hour of parting with a fond adieu. Elm. Alas! the hour of parting! guide me to him. Rod. This way the private staircase winds; nay, madam, Take courage; come. Elm. It is not fear, but agony, That catches thus my breath. Rod. Softly—your hand—come, lady. [Exeunt: Rodolpho leading Elmira. SCENE III. A Hall in Arsenio's House. Enter Lorenzo. Lor. Once more within these walls: once more expecting Elmira's presence; not to kindle fires Of joyous expectation, but to shed A parting beam. And yet my spirits mount, As if foreboding better days at hand. Hark! 'twas the sound of footsteps: there are two: In one methinks I note the tread of age, Heavy and slow; the other trips before, Light and elastic as the air I breathe. O! sure the music of the spheres that roll In melody, is that to which she moves. Ha! she is here. Enter Elmira. Lor. Come thou, for ever present, In soul united, though in person lost: To fold thee thus again, is to assuage The wounds of angry fate. Elm. Would that we now Could die together; and in parting find Oblivion of the pain that life prolongs, 'Till happier worlds relieve us. But methinks, Though still a dearer object to mine eyes, Thy looks are changed. O! even in change the same: Such alteration proves thee more my own; For 'twas the heart, the constant heart, that wrought it. And must we part? Lor. 'Tis hard to say we must; But this unlucky day's result hath left No choice: the hunt begun, advises me That creditors in packs would run me down, Should I remain: therefore to foreign climes, Though not to new delights, I go, for here My hopes and wishes perish. Elm. Yet, one vow Bear with thee into exile. Though my father Already for another suitor pleads, So help me heaven as I am true to thee, When far away, 'till death strikes at my breast, And, striking, startles thy loved image there— Lor. Another suitor! saidst thou so? By heaven We must not part! Elmira, thee I doubt not: But force!—off horrid thought!—didst thou not say That we should die together? Elm. If the fates Had fixed to end us here, 'twould be my comfort. Lor. Then what prevents? Elm. Lorenzo! Lor. Nay, forgive me; I know not what I say. This latest blow Hath reached my brain. I thought the worst gone by; But, to be rivalled! robbed of thee! distraction! Still flight is left us. Elm. Flight! Lor. No bolt secures The gate by which I came. Think how my soul Must shudder, when, with famine at my side, I dare invite thee to partake my fortunes. O! leave me not to madness. Severed from thee, Should but a rumour tell me thou wert in Another's arms, I would not trust my life, Not with those hands, by heaven! Elm. Rodolpho comes; Some other time we'll speak. Lor. He is a man, And for a man will feel, oppressed as I am. Enter Rodolpho. Rod. Signior, the time approaches when my lady Must with her father to devotion speed, Invited by the vesper bell. Resolve At once upon your course. Lor. Arsenio threatens— Rod. I know the piteous wrong he meditates, And would prevent it. You are free to go, If such your will; but first this promise give, That when the holy priest hath made you one, Elmira shall return to ask forgiveness Here of her father. Lor. Promise thee! I bless thee For the kind thought. Elmira! Elm. I am thine, O! judge how wholly thine, when thus consenting. Expect me soon, Rodolpho, and prepare My father's heart. Rod. If he suspect me not, I know to bend him:—but, to countenance The well-meant fraud:—suppose I meet you at The neighbouring convent, when the rites are done, And bring you home, as by compulsion, His daughter,—yet a wife. Lor. My friend! my friend! [Vesper tolls. Rod. Farewell—the vesper tolls—lose not a moment— Fly! Elm. O my father! Lor. 'Tis a blessed signal! Then come, my love!—Now to begin the world! [The vesper tolls as the drop scene falls. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE IV. An Apartment in Arsenio's Palace. Enter Arsenio and Rodolpho. Ar. Returned, and wedded, sayst thou, and entreats To see me? Why didst bring her back? Rod. I deemed, That as thy child, though once in fault,—once only— Thou still might'st wish—or I can drive her hence, And bid her not presume. Ar. There 's no presumption In coming,—simply coming; for the dog That finds its way back to its master's door Will howl there. But to see me, shall it be? Dares she to ask it? Let her come—admit her For the last time, then drive her hence for ever. Rod. Sir, she is here already. [Exit Rodolpho. Enter Elmira. Elm. Ha! there he stands! O look upon a wretch, Who, if she greatly sinned, has greatly suffered! And let this kneeling posture be my pledge To heaven and thee—for I have both offended— How lowly my contrition bows me down. Ar. Rise, madam; thou couldst spurn my counsel once, Contemn my weak commands, despise my favour: It is not meet that one so bold before, Should now betray such mean humility:— Nay, rise, thou wert not born to supplicate. Elm. O speak not strangely thus to one whose brain Is fired with desperation! rather let Your anger spurn, than fright me with this coldness:— Kill me! but know me too. Ar. Away! what purpose Can such remembrance serve, that thou shouldst wish To wake it in my mind? Elm. Forgiveness. Ar. Never. Elm. But for my mother's sake? Ar. Thy mother's! Elm. Her's. Ar. Dar'st thou to hope— Elm. O let her memory Fall on me like a beam from mercy's throne, And show me in my deep affliction! Remember, when she lived, how oft her lip Was wont to bless me: let not your revenge Revoke the blessing thus inherited. Think, too, how dying in her fond embrace She strained us both; when, having made her peace With heaven, she turned a moment to the earth, And shed the last thought of her heart on you, And me together. Ar. Should I think of this? Why, why didst thou forget it then, and leave me? Why didst forget thy home? Elm. I did not, could not: Nor was it love alone that drove me thence; Another suitor came to banish me; And so, half loving—half despairing, I fell from duty. Ar. Leave me! let me go! Thy touch unmans me! Wretched age gives way To tears—But do I weep?—Support me, heaven! Bind up those feeble nerves in iron pride, To stand the shock of melting tenderness: Snatch back those outstretched arms, that spread abroad Forgiving, sheltering, if now abandoned To their own human weakness; fill my mind With images of disobedience; With hopes and pleasures of revenge; with power To seize and wield the fierce prerogative Of parents, who are dreadful when undone! Elm. Hear him not, heaven! but to my suit incline; He prays against the order of all prayer, Which is for mercy, not against it. Ar. Hold! What wouldst thou have? Elm. What I have lost—thy favour. Ar. A prouder bearing would become me more, If I could so deport me; but thy tongue Hath still the sound of home. May be thy mother, Though from the grave, comes warm into my heart; Or thou so like thy mother dost present Her pleading eyes before me. Which it is I know not, but I feel thou art my child, And cannot be to thee as unto others. [Embraces her. Elm. “Thanks to the mighty One!” Thanks to my father! Ar. Conditions purchase pardon, therefore stay Thy gratitude, and hear what I demand. Elm. O! as the act itself is merciful, So be the mandate that prepares its way:— Forgive me all. Ar. When thou hast first consented To shun the villain, by whose arts misled, Thy duty failed. Elm. He wills me not to lose Thy favour for his sake; do thou the same, Nor ask me to desert my love for thee. Ar. I tell thee, if I were expiring here, My dying heart could not forgive him—No! Abhorrence, like an instinct, drives me from That fell antipathy. Let heaven attest Thy solemn vow never to see his face. Elm. What! never? Ar. Not on earth. Elm. I cannot,—dare not. Ar. Then was our meeting vain: but know, ungrateful, The darling object of my care shall be To part you from each other: hope not, therefore, To spend your days in happy dalliance: This arm, though old, may find a nerve to crush him. Elm. I can but say, farewell. Ar. Where wouldst thou go? Elm. No matter where; to famine, bondage, death! It is my husband calls! Though the whole world Be deaf to him, 'tis fitting I should hear. The more they turn away, the more should I Turn towards him: but I thank thee for this threat, It gives me strength to leave thee; it supports The wife against the child, and bears me off In such a resolute horror, that my soul Forgets to feel, so busy with despairing. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. A Street before Arsenio's Palace. Moonlight. Enter Lorenzo and Julio. Jul. She stays so long, I have some hope her suit May win Arsenio's pardon. Lor. Should it fail, What will become of us? Jul. West of the city, Within the forest, stands an ancient castle, Once the proud mansion of my ancestors; There may you live concealed, till time advise What better may be done. The news once spread Of your rich marriage, as the world will call it, Would be a signal for your creditors To press: therefore this night you must away. Lor. O Julio! what an anxious, faithful friend Misfortune meets in thee! But here is one Shall thank thee with an angel's voice.—Elmira! Enter Elmira from the Palace. Lor. Say, what success? Elm. O let us fly this place! The pavement is not harder than his heart, It wounds us not in treading. Lor. We have still A refuge left, our friend, and heaven to guide. Elm. Blessings on both! Julio is pitiful, And so is heaven; for see the night doth shine, As if the Spirit of eternal mercy Had made it for the houseless to rejoice in. But come, the damps have here a keener cold Than any where:—a father's curses chill them. Jul. I will conduct ye to a safe retreat, Whence tumult and the noisy world shut out, Leave all to silence and obscurity. Lor. Lean on me, love, for we have far to go Before we sleep. O! such a bridal night Befits not such a bride. Thine is no form To brave the sickness falling through the sky From evil planets: but if tenderness Can pay thee back for comfort, thou shalt ne'er Regret the time when the cold smile o' the moon, And the pale foliage of the midnight scene, Their sympathies afforded; and the bird, That in the silver hour of solitude, When Italy sleeps in light, sings to the star That loves her music, sang to us the while; And this was all the merry-making passed To grace the nuptials of a fonder pair Than ever feasting hailed!—Lean on me, love. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Cave. A Crowd of Freebooters discovered. 1st Free. My mind misgives me that our parties fare But ill: their length of absence, and the fire With which yon moon, as mimicking the sun, Surrounds her head, unfriendly to the hope Of late marauding, promise disappointment. 2d Free. Still we have chance, our trusty friend of old, To sink impediment. 3d Free. And skill. 2d Free. And courage. Alfero heads one gang, himself an host; And he has comrades chosen from the band For excellence of cruelty. Such men Have characters to lose, and will rob altars Rather than come back empty. 1st Free. Still I doubt Some hostile movement of the State against us. If trade improves not, we must turn to pray, And feed, like friars, on religion. 2d Free. Thou lov'st morality, for morals nurse The riches of a people, and the sword Distributes to the brave. Al. [without.] Yield! yield! there's aid at hand. 1st Free. Hark! that was Alfero's voice. [Swords clashing without. Swords clashing too! Haste we to help; [advancing;] but , lo! he comes triumphant; And in his hand he grasps a woman's arm, Who looks as she would shriek, but dare not. Enter Alfero bearing in Elmira. Al. Ho! Why stand ye thus? one guard the prisoner, The rest attend me to secure two madmen, Who rush upon their fate. Enter Lorenzo, followed by Julio, with their swords drawn. Lor. Assassins, off! I'll cut my way amongst A thousand of ye in a cause like this! She is my wife; and, while this arm can move, I'm her protector. Jul. And, for honour's sake, I'll die beside him, in a woman's cause. 1st Free. Then be it so. [Several of the Freebooters oppose their swords against Lorenzo and Julio. Lorenzo disarms one of them; and Elmira, breaking from the one who holds her, rushes between Lorenzo and the Freebooters. Elm. If ye are men, forbear. Have ye no pride? for shame! they are but two; A thousand tauntings cannot make them more; And will ye crowd to kill them? When they spite ye, 'Tis but the bursting of the heart you hear, And not the challenge of a bold discretion, That bravery should answer. 1st Free. They must yield, Or perish. Lor. If this single arm contained, With my own blood, the blood of all my race, And that one blow were fatal to our name Throughout the generations of mankind, I'd risk it, ere I'd trust her to your mercy. [The Freebooters attempt to press on Lorenzo. Al. [Rushing between them.] A moment hold! confusion of the fray Deceived mine eyes, or I should know Lorenzo. Spare him; our interest bids that he should live. Lor. Whoe'er thou art, that with mysterious mien, And no less mystery of motive, changest From hostile strife to human amity; And stopp'st the steel of murder at our throats; I thank thee for the boon:—but do I see Antonio? Heaven forbid! Al. Yes; the bold outlaw, Denounced by the Senate in another name, The dreaded chief Alfero once was called By such a title, when thou knew'st him better. Lor. Detested slave! why meet we thus? thine oath, Thy solemn oath was pledged to fly from Venice; I gave thee means to fly. Elm. Lorenzo, rav'st thou? What treaty couldst thou form with men of blood? What is't to thee if wretches wait, or wander? Who nothing know, who nothing ought to know, Of thee or thine. Jul. Bestir thee man, arouse; Shake off this slumberous torpor from thy senses, That makes affection's self look doubting on thee, As on a thing of fear. Lor. Have I said aught? No matter—'twas a weakness—let it pass. [A Bugle sounds without. Al. What sound was that? Is it a rescue?—speak! Enter 4th Freebooter. 4th Free. Another body of our force, who ventured Too near the city, are pursued—they come. Even while I tell thee, thousands hem us round, Forbid escape, and nothing leave to choose But death; or worse—surrender! Al. Say you so? Still there is hope; let none oppose; let all Enter an Officer and Guards. Their useless swords resign; themselves submit; And from the Senate ask to meet their doom. Lorenzo, 'tis to thee we look for safety. Lor. To me! Jul. To him! Elm. What means this awful being? Off. How now, in council met? Say thou, the chief, Resolve ye to submit, or try your weapons Against superior force? Al. We yield us to the law. Off. Secure them straight. [The Guards surround them. Lorenzo—Julio here—and fair Elmira! In a rough time this greeting comes; yet fear not, A guard shall e'en conduct you to your home. Elm. Kind sir, we need it not. Off. There 's danger yet; Some stragglers of the band may have escaped. Elm. Then we will be your debtors for protection. Off. Kind fortune go with you—On to the Senate, Even now they sit on business of the State, Most grave and pressing: thither guard the prisoners. Al. Yet one word, ere we go, Lorenzo. Jul. Still That villain! Elm. Hear him not, good officer. By some accursed spell, some magic thrall, He would insnare my husband; nay, perchance, Abuse his honour. Off. 'Twere a vain attempt: Lorenzo's honour to the world is known; And his misfortunes in the multitude Have moved compassion long; suspicion never— Al. Yet look to it, Lorenzo—thou hast friends— Thou art thyself of moment in the city, Or hast been. In thy wreck of influence Enough is left to save us—Look to it, As thou dost value honour; as the sound Of praise is dear to thee, and shame appalling. As thou art conscious of the power I hold To strike thee deeper than the steel could strike, Look to it; see that timely intercession Exchange the torture's pang for banishment, And still be honour's child. Lor. If aught I strive To save thee, 'tis not for thy threats, base slave! Al. Remember— Lor. Hence! thy sight is pestilence! [Exeunt Alfero and Freebooters guarded. Julio, Lorenzo, and Elmira, regard each other for some time in silent astonishment. Jul. What should we think of this? Lor. Why, any thing; Witchcraft, or worse: but, as thou art my friend, And thou my wife—Alas! poor innocent, Thy sufferings wet my cheek; yet, as thou lov'st me, Demand to know no more touching this stranger. Elm. There is a darkness in thy speech, Lorenzo, Through which the light of reason dimly breaks, To show what strange and frightful company Thy thoughts are to each other. Still I am Thy wife—and, as thy wife, I am obedient. Lor. O my Elmira! my best love! thou see'st How fortune and the hand of circumstance, And stars malignant, and the fiends that walk As yet in human flesh, conspire against Thy wretched husband:—judge him not from thence, For no one should be judged from misery: Nor, Julio, let thy wonder call me mad, When on my knees I charge thee save Alfero: Follow him to the Senate,—save his life:— Ask me not why—but save it. Jul. If I could— But what can I? Lor. Thy father's memory Is still revered:—he was a Senator. Implore the Senate in his name. Jul. I will; But this man's crime I fear— Lor. Talk not of fears To me; I have a million in my breast! Elm. The guard attends—'tis time we separate. Jul. I'll try what may be done. [Exit Julio. Lor. Heaven speed thy purpose! [Exeunt Lorenzo and Elmira. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Senate House. The Duke and Senators discovered seated. Arsenio standing. Duke. Arsenio, we have summoned thee to-night, Knowing thy disposition to assist The commonweal. Our ancient enemy, As late advices notify, prepares A numerous army, threatening to the peace Of this dominion. Thou, the richest burgher Within our gates, foremost hast ever stood To help the need o' the time. Some thousand crowns Our drained exchequer needs in this emergence; And from thy loyal hand we ask the same, To be repaid with interest. Ar. Good, my lords! That you remember my poor services, Touches what soothing strings are yet unbroken About my heart. That you demand, is yours. I had a daughter once; but she is lost— Torn by a ruffian from my arms:—I loved her, I doted; 'twas my fault; but I am punished:— My country be my heir. Duke. Not so, good signior; Thy daughter lives. Anger will soon decay Where nature once prevailed; and pity, like A second birth, and dearer than the first, Give the returning outcast to thy bosom.— But to our business. Enter Officer and Prisoners. Off. Let the prisoners pass. My lords, Alfero and the desperate band, Infesting long our suburbs, now attend For judgment. [Exit one Soldier. Enter Alfero, guarded. Duke. Haste, conduct their chief before us. The sentence of outlawry passed against him Cuts short all form of trial; therefore, bending To the stern law, he must prepare to die. Enter an Attendant. Attend. Julio, in anxious haste, demands admittance To this grave presence. Duke. At this hour of night, And pressed by weighty cares, let none approach us. Such, tell him, are thy orders. [Exit Attendant. Al. [Aside.] Then 'tis plain I must resolve on other means of safety; And there are better here:—but now to use them. [To the Senate.] As we are thus denied all course of law, All privilege of counsel, or of speech, Touching the crime for which you do pronounce That we must suffer: still, if justice be An act substantial, not a name, in Venice, I have the means to alter your decree. Know, then, I bear a secret in my soul Of more importance to the ends of justice, Than were the death of twenty routed slaves, Whose strength to injure is for ever gone. Nay, it is here; the import touches all, For it affects domestic confidence, The home of every man; (and who so poor To have no home?) yet most the rich it aims at. But torture cannot find it. Grant us life, E'en curs'd with slavery, and you shall know What Venice little dreams. Duke. Away with him! He would abuse our fancies, to escape. Al. Give me but leave to tell Arsenio that, My silence long hath treasured. If he say not The knowledge more imports you than our groans, Why, take the better bargain. Ar. Pray you, lords, To grant his suit. I will report him truly. Duke. At your solicitation we consent. Conduct him therefore to the private chamber: But soon return; for we shall wait thy counsel, Whether to lend an ear to his complaint, Or take the forfeit his offences owe us. [Exeunt Arsenio and Alfero. SCENE II. A Chamber in the Senate House. Enter Arsenio and Alfero. Ar. Why hast thou singled me to hear the tale That falsehood conjures to arrest thy doom? How can it appertain to my concern What thou hast known in Venice? Al. Were it false, It would import thee nothing. Being true, It may supply the cravings of revenge; And be of dear advantage, inasmuch As thou wouldst crush Lorenzo. Ar. Is't of him Thou'dst speak? If bad, go on. If good, expire In silence. Put him in my power—and let The Duke outbid his coronet in naming A ransom for thy life, it shall be paid. Al. Judge from the opening if the close be worth A patient ear:—Thy brother died of poison. Ar. Proceed.—The very horror thou strik'st through me, Flashes a frightful hope. Al. Lorenzo dated His ruin from Rinaldo's guardianship, And to a fatal reckoning call'd his foe.— To ease thy strong impatience,—I beheld,— These eyes beheld him mix the deadly drug, Which, to the seat of being, bore a summons Strict as the call of fate. Ar. My brother's death To be revenged, my daughter's loss requited! My wrongs repaired, and all upon Lorenzo! And ample means at hand to perfect all! Establish this, and thou art free as air From bonds and accusation. Al. Put me to The proof: arraign him: nay, to give our charge A higher import with the assembled court, E'en swell the action to a public crime, Aver that every Senator was doomed To the same death. Their judgment passed against him Will give it countenance: and thus shall I, Secure of pardon, smile—and thou secure Of vengeance. Ar. That my child should be his wife!— O wretched woman!—Yet, I am a father. Al. Thou wouldst not pardon? Ar. I would save my child. I tremble for her. In a murderer's arms She sleeps. O! let me wake her to her danger. Al. Thy tears unfit thee. Ar. Thou mistak'st their meaning. Compassion for Elmira blends indeed Some gentle drops; but vengeance weeps the rest. Al. Back to the Senate, then. Ar. Hold! There are reasons To check our haste. Great need is there of proof Confirming thine, to make his guilt appear. Not that I doubt his guilt: for he who made My soul abhor him, grants me now to see The reason why. But the regard of law Lends a slow diligence to the approver, Whom large reward invites. Thus, warn'd of rashness, Be our approaches grave. The steady march Is that which suits the hot engagement; To spend no breath, nor waste a single blow, 'Till death is present with the enemy. Al. Advise me of the means thy caution notes, To make our purpose surer of its aim. Ar. I'll tell thee all. First, for thy safety, fear not. My purse is open to the State; and he Who grants a favour has a right to claim. Touching the evidence, my plan proceeds To tell the Senate (not at full explaining The substance of the charge) what heavy matter Thy tongue hath laid before me. To explore The truth, and weigh the value of such matter, I will solicit leave that you attend me, A guard accompanying, to what place Lorenzo now inhabits. Al. This is well: And of his refuge we can learn betimes From those who gave him escort. But proceed— Ar. Once in the murderer's presence, need I say How, like the thunder bursting on the night, My voice shall reach his soul? Thee will I summon, As we shall best consider by the way, To strike his falsehood mute. Then, for the proofs That nature lends in aid of circumstance; “The dark surprise, which, while it wonders, speaks “Confusion, not disdain—the fixed eye— “The colour of the cheek—the death-like pause— “Or guilt's unconscious accent crying out— “May, like a fiend disturbed, confess itself, “And damn its habitation.” Those observing, I hope to find such strong presumptive aid, As to the Senate will confirm thy story, If prudence bid proceed. Al. Then 'tis in doubt Whether you do persist to punish him? Ar. My daughter calls him husband. If he choose To part from her and Italy to-night, Her will I spare the shame; to Heaven committing The anxious charge, to follow him in storms, And greet his search for quiet—with despair. Al. Advance we now to meet him, leave obtaining; And see thou mark him close. Ar. Mark him! Ay, trust me; Keen as the tiger winds his prey, when famine Exasperates his instinct.—I am with thee. [Exeunt. SCENE III. An Apartment in Julio's Castle, representing on one Side a large Window in the Venetian Fashion, reaching to the Ground, and opening like folding Doors. Lorenzo discovered. Lor. If Julio fail, 'tis but to die, and so Escape the worst. Would he were come! Enter Elmira. Elm. Lorenzo! Lor. How now, my love? Elm. Why art thou wandering thus, Through the vast avenues and lonely halls Of this drear mansion? As I followed thee I heard thee talk of death. Lor. Yes; I was thinking That all must die; kings, princes must obey The freezing call. Statesmen must one day stoop To pay their court to the despotic tomb: Lawyers must there refund the fee of life: Heroes, unarmed, forgetting sieges, battles, Must, far from glory, and the sound of praise, Take their last station: inspired orators Must shun the multitude, whose mind they made, And cleave to silence and oblivion: The player must desert his mimic scene, To die indeed: and poets, fond of hope, With their fine sense of life, must humble too; And, at the summons, quit Castalia's spring, To plunge amid the gloom of Erebus. 'Tis to the wretch alone that he denies The solace of his sleep. Elm. Thy speech affrights me. Thou wouldst not rashly dare—thou wouldst not venture On the wide countries of the unknown life— Lor. Fear not, my love,—but look where Julio comes. Leave us—to rest retire—I soon will follow. [Exit Elmira. Enter Julio. Lor. Now, Julio, say what news? Jul. As yet, there 's none; I was refused admittance to the Senate. Lor. Then all is lost. Jul. Not so; for, in my stead, A friend of greater note has undertaken To supplicate their mercy for Alfero. Lor. Yet one thing goads my mind. The time is come When guilt can hide no more. The only secret I ever kept from thee must now unfold Its cloak to thy discerning. But an oath— An oath must seal it in thy conscious breast, Thence to be never torn. Jul. I swear— Lor. By what? Jul. By that hereafter hope, which is the source Of constancy and virtue. Lor. Nay, though torture Should labour at thy joints, to drive it out In drops of blood, let not confession mingle. Nay, still, though I, thy friend, were on the rack, And that one word would rescue me from pangs Which live upon the body's substance long, To the surprise and grief of nature, spurn, Renounce the heaven above us, if that word Should 'scape thy lips; “wrung by a perjur'd mercy From an incapable soul.”—Dost hesitate? Jul. 'Tis dreadful!—but I swear, abjuring heaven, And claiming hell my portion, if I speak, Even to preserve my friend. Lor. Then know, the wretch Whose life I'd have thee save, was once my vassal. I thought not then his former trade was rapine, But chose him for his zeal. I brought him here— Rinaldo seized my rights.—Arsenio's malice Refused Elmira to my arms.—Despair Imparted rage; and rage let in distraction. One fatal day this same Alfero proffered To do me justice; to restore my wealth; To bless me with the wife my heart had fixed on; And—shall I speak it out—to poison him Who trod those prospects down! By the great Power, Inhabitant of yon blue monarchy, I know not what I said. But, for some words In madness uttered, I am branded with The crime of murder!— Start not!—thou need 'st not fear me. Jul. O Lorenzo, I pity thee,—not fear. Lor. Look! those are tears; For gratitude can melt 'em, though despair Hath froze them up from sorrow. I had thoughts Of dying,—but thy pity bids me live! Jul. Yes, live, and still be happy. Lor. Never, Julio; Never again: even at my bridal hour Thou saw'st detection, like a witch, look on And smile, and mock at the solemnity, Conjuring the stars. “Hark! was not that a noise?” Jul. “No; all is still. Lor. “Have none approached us? Jul. “None. Lor. “Then 'twas my fancy. Every passing hour “Is crowded with a thousand whisperers; “The night hath lost its silence, and the stars “Shoot fire upon my soul. Darkness itself “Has objects for mine eyes to gaze upon, “And sends me terror when I pray for sleep “In vain upon my knees. Nor ends it here; “My greatest dread of all—detection—casts “Her shadow on my walk, and startles me “At every turn: sometimes will reason drag “Her frightful chain of probable alarms “Across my mind; or, if fatigued, she droop, “Her pangs survive the while; as you have seen “The ocean tossing when the wind is down, “And the huge storm is dying on the waters.” Once, too, I had a dream— Jul. The shadows of our sleep should fly with sleep; Nor hang their sickness on the memory. Lor. Methought the dead man, rising from his tomb, Frowned over me. Elmira, at my side, Stretched her fond arms to shield me from his wrath, At which, he frowned the more. I turn'd away, Disgusted, from the spectre, and assayed To clasp my wife; but she was pale, and cold, And in her breast the heart was motionless, And on her limbs the clothing of the grave, With here and there a worm, hung heavily. Then did the spectre laugh, till from its mouth Blood dropp'd upon us, while it cried—‘Behold! Such is the bridal bed that waits thy love!’— I would have struck it, (for my rage was up): I tried the blow; but, all my senses shaken By the convulsion, broke the tranced spell, And darkness told me—sleep was my tormentor. Jul. And thou would'st have this vision prophesy To thy delivered senses. Banish it— Believe what is. E'en should the worst befall, There lies a dungeon at this castle 's foot Known but to me. It was, in early time, A refuge from the violence of war, When savage battle spared not. In its bosom Thou may'st elude the strictest search. Lor. Alas! If life were all my care, to find that dungeon Had been a transport: but my honor, Julio!— My dread of shame! Jul. Still is it some relief To shun the public trial, whose result Would more thy reputation mar than hints Of weak surmise, though absence gave a scope To its worst virulence. Lor. True, true, my friend! There are degrees in baseness. Show this dungeon— Misery may come any where, but scorn Can be avoided; and the darkest cell That shuts it out is as a throne to me, Whose glory shines in the contempt it conquers. Jul. Observe this secret spring. [He touches a spring, upon which a door in the back scene flies open. The door now open, By steps of solid rock, leads down to darkness. Another portal there defends the womb Of the deep cavern; and to silence gives Security, by distance almost infinite. It is not in the hollow lungs of famine To send a shriek so high. Lor. Replace the spring, A foot approaches. [Julio replaces the door. Enter a Servant. Ser. To Lorenzo's hand, This letter from Arsenio. He attends. Lor. What can it mean? How! in so mild a tone. [Reads.] “Arsenio would bespeak Lorenzo's ear, To offer terms.” What terms? and with what view? Admit Arsenio. [Exit Servant. Thou, my friend, retire; Yet stop within my call. Away—he comes. [Exit Julio. Enter Arsenio. Lor. I strive in vain to read within thine eye The aspect of a kind intelligence. If from this paper I have rightly gleaned The meaning, couch'd in phrase, a gentler look Would more become our meeting. Ar. I am come To serve thee, not befriend; the good I offer Must breathe from lips that have not ceased to curse; Therefore I keep the aspect that befits My feeling, though my purpose be more kind. Lor. Away then courtesy!—Speak as thou wilt, I'll answer as I ought. Ar. Resolve me first; Can riches bribe thee to forego the right By which thou hold'st my daughter? Lor. Kingdoms could not. Ar. Can fear? Lor. I have no fears but when I look Upon her face and think of separation. Ar. Is death unable to subdue the power With which you grasp her close? Lor. If death command This glorious light, the mind, to soar aloft, And seek its kindred essence, I must stoop To lay the mortal relic at his feet, In attitude of meek obedience. But if you put the choice to die possessing, Or live renouncing what my soul adores, Then give me death: for 'tis unutterable How desolate were life, by her abandoned! Ar. But what if death, embittered by disgrace, Should threaten? Lor. Ha! speak! tell me! what disgrace? Ar. No matter. Lor. But it is—and matter, sir, For strife to moot. Ar. You understand me, then? I come to claim my child. Lor. I claim my wife. Who shall resist that claim? Ar. A father. Lor. Hence! While yet thou may'st escape. Ar. Restore her. Lor. Never! Ar. Art thou determined? Lor. Fixed—resolved—immoveable.— The oak is not more rooted when he lifts His everlasting arms, and vaunts aloud To the high storm. Ar. Then be thy guilt proclaimed; I'll have thee known through Venice for a murderer! Lor. Ha! Ar. Dragged, like any felon, to the place Of execution; there to satisfy My brother's ghost! Lor. Has the sun dropped from heaven? Or is it in the force of misery To change the lightsome colour of the day To this dark aspect? Villain! in thy face I look at hell, and am already damned! Ar. Farewell, until we meet in judgment. Lor. Hold! I kneel before thee. In the name of truth, Urge not a charge, the breath of which destroys, Even though I prove it false. Remember, too, I'm of thy family; thou canst not fling Disgrace on me, without thyself partaking.— Thy child will not survive it, if I die; Or be degraded by a murderer's name.— I will not live suspected. Ar. Perish then, And trouble me no more. Yet, once again, Wilt thou restore Elmira? Lor. Any thing— Any but that. Ar. Enough, I now am answered. O! if my words alone can shake thee thus, What will this presence! Enter Alfero. Lor. [To Alfero.] Monster! perjurer! Ha! knows the Senate all?—say so, and kill me. Al. As yet they are in ignorance. Lor. Thank heaven, Thank heaven for that! Al. Nay, hope not to escape, For even now a guard is at the gate. Lor. Still I can die. [Draws his sword. Ar. Call for assistance. [To Alfero. Lor. Hold! That call shall be thy last; death, death shall answer! Ar. Would'st add another murder to the one Wherewith thy soul is stained already? Lor. So! And is't for thee to preach? I hold my fame So precious, that those eyes by which I drink The light of heaven, And make all glorious nature tributary To my enjoyment, are as worthless balls Compared with it. And thou to preach!—My life; Mark you, my life! This fine capacity Of motion, sense, and thought, opposed against it, Is as a cup of water, which I spill Upon the earth in very wantonness. And shall I leave this idol of my soul For thee to prostrate? Is there not an echo In thine own breast, to sound the fierce denial That bursts from mine?—What's to be done—I have it. Al. Beware, Lorenzo. Lor. I would save us all. There is a secret passage, leading hence, Through subterraneous windings, to a dell Within the wood, and thence to the free air; Thither will I conduct you. Leaving thus The guard behind us, we shall profit by The time we gain, to fix upon some course Of reconcilement. Ar. No; we dare not trust thee. Lor. Old and unarmed, ye cannot face a man So strong in desperation. Enter Julio. Lor. Julio, too, My constant friend, is at my side already. Here lies the way. [Julio touches the spring, and the secret door flies open. Your choice is—die, or enter. Al. The guards once passed, my own escape were certain. Lorenzo, I consent. Ar. Deserted thus, No choice is left to me. Thou hast prevailed By treachery. Yet, Julio is not base; I will confide in him if he attend us. Denouncing to the last that bloody hand Of thine, which, mark me, vengeance will surprise; Heaven has an interest in its overthrow. Jul. [To Arsenio. I will attend. Lor. Put up thy foolish fears. Advance—we follow—haste—I listen for The soldiers' tread—All's safe and silent—On. [Alfero and Arsenio exeunt through the secret door, Julio and Lorenzo following. END OF ACT THE THIRD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Scene continued. Enter Lorenzo and Julio from the private door. Lor. Hush! all is still! come forth, and let me bless thee, For this, and every good. Jul. We lost them soon In the dark windings of the vault. Now bars Of massy bulk divide them from the steps By which they did descend.—But how explain Their absence? Lor. That I know not yet. But here, Beyond this lattice, to the river's edge, A parapet outstretches; and, below, Close to the castle's side, a boat is moor'd; Descend, and cut the rope, while I remain Alone to meet the guard. Jul. What, leave thee thus? I have already ventured more for friendship Than risk of life. Think'st thou that risk could warn me? Lor. 'Tis better for us both. What I shall do Must be by stratagem. “Thou'lt serve me more “By 'scaping hence, to 'scape suspicion also, “And thus be free to aid me still. Return “Anon,—for I shall need thy counsel much.” The shortest absence will suffice to clear Thy conduct of concernment in this business. Jul. Agreed. Yet, O remember, those who breathe In darkness, still are men! Lor. Fear not: “This hand “Shall feed them there; even as the ravens fed “The prophet in the wild: fear not for them.” [Exit Julio through the folding door. Lor. What 's to be done? What if I say Alfero Against Arsenio charged some heavy crime; And that, by mutual and concerted act, They hither came to shun the penalty Of angry law? Even as my friend has gone, Will I of them report.—The Senate knows not.— And have I sunk to this bad game at last, To stake the blessed truth 'gainst wretched safety; And, for the certain loss, have but my chance Of reputation covered by a lie? O guilt! is this thine aid?—are these thy means? But to be called a murderer! to die A shameful death! or, ('scaping death) to live A terror! a reproach! Where do I wander? The fastnesses of falsehood must protect, When truth is full of menace. Ha! they come. Enter an Officer and Soldiers. Off. Signior, the hour demands that we return Our prisoner to his judges. Lor. Whom? what would you? Off. On short reprieve Alfero holds his life, And must not longer stay. Lor. Find, and conduct him. Off. 'Tis vain to trifle thus: the gate we guarded: No soul hath left or entered in the time Of our strict watch. Lor. You guarded well the gates— But did you march your troops upon the water? Look how the waves are riding to the sea, As if they crowded to behold the pomp Of ocean, where he meets the foremost tide, And thunders welcome to the fugitives. Off. Ha! gone, escaped! Lor. Beyond pursuit for ever! The tempest hath not such a wing as fear; An eagle's valorous speed is toughly strained To chase the smallest bird; and the thin worm Will pierce and wound the earth, as with a sword, To cut its way, if but a touch provoke The feats that fright can do. Off. But is Arsenio Gone with the other? Lor. He had greater cause. “Alfero's life was forfeit,—but his heart “Had set no store on that which higher natures “Prize, to the scorn of life and limb—their honour.” Arsenio's honour in that wretch's power Might well have made him desperate,—he was so. “No chance remained; for, whether true or false, “The tooth of accusation wounds and mangles “The sensitive vein of pride.” Off. But I would know If he is gone? Lor. He is,—what could he do? Alfero threatened to denounce him strait To all mankind, if he should fail to move The Senate in his favour. That he could not;— There was but one resource, on which resolving, The river was not far, nor the wind adverse. Off. “You speak this matter well to my plain ear; “But to allow their flight was criminal.” Lor. “There I confess my weakness. To the State “I owed the duty of a subject, bound “To aid her laws, and see her justice rendered; “But something, too, I owed to nature's pleading; “For, though he wronged me, we were still allied; “He called me—son—the name itself was tender; “Despair had put it in his mouth: he kneeled: “Elmira's image ruling in my heart, “Snatched him within its sanctuary; held him “Even in the seat that mercy calls her own; “Exposed his wrinkled brow, his hoary head, “Where every silver hair complained of time, “Counted the tears that in a scalding shower “Dropt their large sorrow on his breast; said all “A child can say, who pleads a father's cause, “And gained in all that love is sure to gain, “Though justice thundered from the capitol.” Off. This you must answer to the Duke himself; My duty bids that I conduct you to him. Lor. Even as you will,—I mean to answer it. Enter Elmira. Elm. Lorenzo, stay! Are all mankind in league To tear my husband from me? Lor. [Aside.] This is what I would have shunned the most. Elm. How is it thus, That in the deep and peaceful hour of night The servants of the State should swarm our dwelling? What is the cause? Off. Resistance to the law: He doth refuse a prisoner to our call, By justice doomed to die. Moreover, lady, He hath disposed of one thou 'lt much lament— Thy father:—how and wherefore, to the Senate He must account, to the which end we seize him. Elm. Heard I aright? was it my father's name? Lor. Good sir, withdraw the guard. My honour pledged Will give you just assurance that I bear No wish to 'scape. Elm. One moment to a wife. Off. It must be short, for time advises speed. Take thou [to one of the Guard] the fleetest courser, and acquaint The Senate what has happened. Say we follow. Guard thou the parapet by which Alfero Escaped our watch. Another guard the portal, Whose opening gave us entrance; while the rest, With strict attention, search the castle through, In quest of those intrusted to our care. [Officer and Guards retire at different Passages. Lor. Accept my best of thanks.—And now, Elmira, Dispel the doubts and fears, which on thy brow Hold troubled counsel. For thy father's safety Thou canst not tremble, love! Elm. Where is my father? Lor. Secure from harm. Elm. But where? Lor. High heaven hath willed, Among my other woes, this sharp affliction. For reasons, which I dare not yet proclaim, Thy father must be private. Look not on me With such a piercing sorrow; for be sure Your separation shall not longer last Than my great need requires. Elm. Thy need requires! Mine asks that he be here. Lor. Alas! thou know'st not, Refusing to resign, at his command, Thy love for ever, falsely did he charge me With such a crime, that to be charged alone Were irretrievable disgrace, too strong For pardon to remove, or innocence To combat. Elm. And could'st thou, to shun that charge, Profane his reverend locks? Lor. No, as I hope For mercy! In thine arms he were not less A prey to outrage. Come, then, smile once more, And let me see thy confidence revive, In cheeks that blush to have suspected me. Elm. Yes, when he comes to bid me smile— Lor. And brand Thy husband, in thy hearing, and before The credulous and evil-judging world, With a foul crime! Elm. What crime? Lor. I dare not whisper The shame! the shame! If he had held his sword To my bare breast, not all my wrongs, my ravings, Not nature struggling in her favourite cause Of life, could urge me to endanger his; So dear I knew you prized it. But attempting To drive me from the seat of good men's minds,— To chain my reputation to the ground,— There to be trod upon.—Say, was I not To make resistance? I have done no more. The veriest slave that crawls had done as much, Or lost his title to humanity “By the neglect.” Then how have I offended? Elm. I can preserve thee otherwise. Conduct me To find him,—he shall swear eternal silence. Lor. Th' attempt were vain. Elm. Prove, e'er you thus pronounce it. Lor. I kneeled to him—he spurned me! Elm. What of that? A kneeling foe is not a kneeling child. Lor. Urge me no more; it cannot be. Elm. It must, If I am worth possessing. O, Lorenzo! I have not yet forgot that dreadful scene, The robbers' haunt; nor him who knew thee there. What such associates may persuade, is more Than I can tell; but to suspect is phrensy! Lor. Elmira, hear; by heaven you do me wrong! Elm. Prove it. Let me but see him; not to speak, But satisfy mine eyes. Lor. Will not my oath— Elm. What are your oaths to me? If you have dipped Your hands in blood of mine, will oaths console me? Will they undo the deed? Pierce the firm earth, That makes oblivion lasting? Raise the fallen? Close up the wound through which the spirit fled? Recall that spirit to its shatter'd home, And, in the empty vessels of the heart, Revive the pulse, and make it beat again, Because you swore 'twas beating? Lor. Is it thus Thy love is shown at last? Elm. Oh! I have shown it, Even by the loss of all, without complaining; Nor do I now complain. Keep back the prospect Of wealth and splendour: nay, the holy sound That pours parental blessings down keep back; For freely I resigned them: but my father! Give me my father! Lor. 'Tis impossible! Elm. My heart has stopt to hear thee speak again. Lor. I cannot. Elm. But a word: say I shall see him! Lor. Another time. Elm. 'Till then, I know thee not. Lor. For mercy's sake, Elmira! wilt thou join The cruel world, and take its part against me? Yet pause— Elm. The voice of Heaven cries out, Persist! Heaven, I obey. [Exit Elmira. Lor. Alone, and yet alive! [Enter Guards. My dream is coming true. Now, sirs, I'm ready. [To the Guards. There is not trial after this but one; The worst of human penalty is over. [Exit Lorenzo, guarded. SCENE II. Another Apartment in the Castle. Enter Julio and Rodolpho. Jul. Well met in evil time, my good Rodolpho! Rod. Was that Lorenzo whom they bore away? Jul. The same. Rod. Alas! I fear hard fortune waits him. Jul. Hast thou heard aught? O yes; thy presence here At such an hour, forebodes some sad event, Or known, or dreaded by thee. Rod. I am come To tell of strange proceeding in the Senate. They sat, and were in council deep engaged, When, by a breathless messenger despatched From hence, they learned Alfero's late escape; And, by the same advice, my master's absence. Jul. Bring'st thou their comments? Rod. I was summon'd forth, And questioned; but, my ignorance made known, Was soon dismissed. Yet, not before I heard Their friendship for Arsenio, ofttimes vowed, And their suspicions added, that Lorenzo Was treacherous; having, by death, or bondage, Suppressed the evidence of some dark crime Against him threatened. Jul. And are those our judges, Who fling the trash their own suspicions breed, Into the scale they hold? Rod. What most amazed me, The Duke apprised them of a plan to reach The truth in its concealment. Then he paused, And said:—'Twas harsh and cruel, but the end Would justify the means! Jul. What could he purpose? Rod. Some fatal scheme. Jul. 'Tis like he meditates To try the torture. O, my hapless friend! How will his shatter'd nerves endure the search Of the inquisitive anguish? But, behold, Elmira comes! What mischief grief has done In that pale cheek! cropping the healthful rose; Yet with a hand so tender, that the bed Of beauty, where it grew, is scarce impaired By absence of its bloom. How now, sweet lady! Enter Elmira. Elm. When we would speak the names that most delight, Are they not—husband! father! Is it so With me? Can I on either dwell, and say, This gives me comfort? No; my grief, my horror, Associate with the very words that breathe A balm on other hearts. Jul. She heeds us not. Elm. And is he dead, or dying? and do I Deliberate to call th' offended law Down on his murderer! Who murdered him? 'Tis madness but to think!—Come, let me wake The holy vengeance that was stamped on Cain, To mark him too.—I should revenge my father! On whom should I revenge him? On my husband! What, then, must I become? A widow! made By my own hand. Am I to have no mercy? Teach me, thou dreadful Power, whose name is justice, If it be so: then kill me, and be satisfied. Jul. I dare not reason with a grief like thine: Yet, know the Duke is fixed to find thy father, If on the earth alive. Elm. Eternal blessings Reward his gracious effort. Rod. To that end Detection toils, and justice lifts her arm.— Elm. But where to strike? Curst! withered be the arm Which falls in anger on my husband's head! O this perplexing state! What shall I do? Whom shall I bless? Whom curse? I have no right To curse or bless; to do like other beings, Who in their very wishes have a power Denied to me. If I invite a wish On either side, it looks so frightful at me, The stirring of my mind is terrible.— But who is this? Enter a Messenger of the Senate. Jul. Your business? Mess. From the Senate. Elm. Speak to him, ask what I can only hear? Mess. My mission, lady, from the Duke proceeds, Who, sitting now in council, doth command Thy presence there. Elm. What would he have with me? That I am wretched, for our common loss, He needs not to be told, who knows my share in't. But I have no complaint; my grief is mute, And asks not human aid to bring it comfort. Mess. Yet, though you make no charge, 'tis fit you come To clear yourself. Elm. Of what? Mess. Suspicion lights Upon your head, that you have done the deed. Elm. What deed? Mess. Conspired against Arsenio's life. Elm. Fool! was he not my father? Mess. There have been Hands dipped ere now in parricide. Elm. O Julio! Hear this! Lorenzo, where art thou, to cleave This ruffian's tongue to the root! Ye mighty gods, What are your thunders fit for, if they sleep While injury prevails beneath their sway! Is it to rouse the lion from his dream, Or in the bosom of the waters scare The finny race, that you disturb all heaven, While sinners laugh securely as they hear The muttering impotence, which shakes the earth, But does not execution on its villanies. Jul. Be patient, madam, what has innocence Like thine to fear? Elm. Every thing! every thing, In such a world! Jul. Tis vain, we must submit To the Duke's mandate. Thou, Rodolpho, go Attend thy mistress to the Senate House, While to Lorenzo's ear I bear the news Of this determined outrage. Elm. Bear to him My love—my blessing—it may be the last. Jul. He who defends the good, is on thy side; For though to be insulted is the lot Misfortune draws on earth, there is a shield To guard the character of innocence “From worse dishonour: wherefore be assured “There is no strength in justice, but to save thee.” Elm. Whate'er my lot, that shield be on Lorenzo. Oh! may he prove both innocent and happy! [Exeunt severally: Elmira guarded. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. A Dungeon. Lorenzo discovered in chains. Lor. Chains! and a dungeon! and despair within! But is there not in penitence—Away! Repentance will not come without disgrace; And with disgrace it shall not. To be firm, In silence and in suffering, is my task. How now? Enter Jailor. Jail. An anxious messenger attends, By our great Duke's command. Lor. Bid him approach. [Exit Jailor. “He brings my fate with him. I wrote at length, “In furtherance of what I said before, “Touching the absence of my enemies, “And why they fled.” Enter Messenger. Lor. So, sir. What says the Duke? Mess. The matter of thy statement he hath weighed, But finds no satisfaction to his doubts In the strange story. Lor. Well, what follows? He Has doubts, and I must bleed for't. Is it so? Mess. If, ere the night be wasted, thou should'st fail To bring the convict and Arsenio both Before him living, he will lay their death To your account; and, by the torture, force Confession from the quivering lips of anguish. Lor. Confession! Go, thou know'st me not; nor he Who sent thee here. “If ye would frighten boys, “Show them the whip.” If ye would frighten cowards, The rack may do it: but a man whose heart Is set in firmer casing, smiles at death. Torture, ye may—ye cannot frighten him. So tell the Duke from me. Mess. I will obey you. [Exit Messenger. Lor. “My dream is out.” The murdered man told true; And the night shadow that forewarned my fall, Spoke with a tongue of meaning. “Fearful shade! “Most like to death; I'll meet thee in the grave, “And there confess what in this world I dare not.” Ha! Julio, welcome, though it be to tell me My hour is come. Speak! Enter Julio. Jul. 'Tis not that; but worse Than that which brings me. Lor. Wherefore this delay To utter it? I am no prosperous fool, Who shudders at the sound misfortune makes. I wear a mailed horror round my heart, Not to be pierced or shaken. Jul. Hear it then. Thy wife is foul belied; accused of murder, Even of her father's murder! Lor. How! her father's! My wife accused!—She must be justified, Though on the snow of her pure innocence I perish. “Here the struggle ends for ever. “Thy heralds, Fate, are many, but this last “Hath borrowed thine own voice.” Jul. What wouldst thou do? Lor. “Encounter any thing to save Elmira.” Deliver up my foes; abash my friends; Shake hands with horror; bid the world farewell; And be a ruined voucher for her truth And purity. Jul. When, not expecting this, She sent her blessing to thee as I came, How would she bless thee now! Lor. Methinks I hear The sweetness of her disappointed voice Call that vain blessing down:—But 'tis no time For tenderness. Fling me thy brand, Despair, The wretch's weapon, tempered in the fires Of madness; that when justice dooms, and shame Cries out against me, I may stand the shock; Or die like an entangled lion, biting The toils e'en with the gasp that ends my life. Jul. Invoke some blessed power, and not the fiend Despair, to help thee in extremity. Arsenio may be moved. Lor. The mountain flood May be damm'd up by a word, if Heaven pronounce it; And the declining sun struck back into His high meridian seat by miracle: When wonders like to those grow common, mercy May find her way into Arsenio's breast; But not till then. Jul. His daughter, and thy wife, Elmira, were a suitor to whose plea His hate could not demur. Lor. My wife plead for me! She is the last on earth that I would have Suspect my guilt, or know for what I pleaded. But, that no chance be lost, fly to the castle, Set free mine adversaries, and once more Bid that Arsenio speak with me. Jul. 'Tis well. This way he passes to the Senate House, And here shall meet thee. Yet, before we part, One promise I would crave. “I know thy spirit “Shrinks from the touch of scorn, and values life “No longer than 'tis honoured: I have fears.” Lor. What fears? Jul. That if Arsenio should persist, And, spite of nature, still be deaf to mercy, This parting, O! my friend, may be our last! Lor. And couldst thou wish to see me after? Jul. Once. Lor. “But once?” Jul. “Once, at all hazards.” Lor. Then I'll meet thee In open Senate, though the shame should burn My cheeks into the bone. So thrive my soul Hereafter, as I keep this vow. Jul. I thank thee; And now, in haste, farewell. [Julio attempts to go. Lor. “Farewell! yet hold: “I cannot part thee even for a moment “On such light terms. Methinks, to say farewell, “Like travellers dividing on a road “Where pleasant prospects rise, and the sun shines, “Befits not our condition. We are severed “By wind, and rain, and in a troubled sea, “And under night; and as the scene is awful, “The parting should be solemn. One embrace: “It may—but 'tis no matter—heaven be with thee!” [Exeunt severally; Julio into one adjoining cell. SCENE II. The Chamber in the Senate House. Enter the Duke and Elmira. Elm. Where are my chains? where is the rack to end me? Duke. None are intended, lady. None deserved. Elm. If thou suspect my soul of such a crime, Why spare the mortal part? If thou would'st brand My name with such a charge, why make a show Of mercy, and forbear the slighter wound, When thou hast aimed the greater? Duke. Hear the cause; But hear it; then upbraid me, if thou canst. Elm. That I was torn from my own wretched home At thy command—that here I stand thy prisoner, And soon may be thy victim; this is all I know, or care to know. Therefore to judgment. Duke. I pity the disorder of thy grief, Which still arrests my tongue; but if thou'lt grant An ear of patience to my brief discourse, I'll point thee out such reason for the act, As shall thy praise ensure. Elm. Ha! praise! for what? An act of outrage? Duke. No; of kindness, lady; Restoring thy lost father. Elm. Mock me not; I have lost every thing. Duke. What if thy seizure, The very injury of which thou speak'st, Hath to Lorenzo's heart appealed with force— With gentle force—and that to rescue thee From such imagined peril, he should break Thy father's bonds, and give him back to freedom, Where was the cruelty of that pretence Which led to such deliverance? Elm. I fear My brain's unsettled: a distracting light Breaks in to summer hope,—and then confound. Heard I aright? Said'st thou my father lived, And was restored by my Lorenzo's love, And that my seizure led to this? O say so! In pity, swear it; speak, I will be dumb, But let me hear thee loud. Duke. 'Tis yet uncertain, Though like to be. Elm. Uncertain! Duke. But still probable. Elm. No more; why then disturb a wretch, prepared To meet the worst, with vain imaginations? Duke. I hold them not as vain, but well consenting, And nigh to happen. That Arsenio lives I little doubt; that thy Lorenzo bears A bosom full of thee, is the belief On which my honest artifice proceeded. If he do love thyself, he loves thy fame; He loves thy life; and thinking both in danger, Whate'er his sullen purpose, it will bend And break, if harm seem but to threaten thee. Elm. And is't for this I am accused? Duke. For this. Elm. I bless thee, and the well-intended wrong; I bless thee, though I tremble; for a sad Foreboding bids my soul take no delight in't. Enter a Messenger. Mess. Julio attends your Grace, and with him brings A prisoner guarded. Elm. And my father, too? Brings he my father? Mess. That himself must answer. [Exit Messenger. Enter Julio. Elm. O! Julio, say— Jul. I left him with Lorenzo, To follow soon. Elm. Then I am loved indeed, And happy in such love,—but are they friends? Jul. Demand no more,—conjecture cannot move 'Till they are present. With his Highness now My business is to say Arsenio lives, And thou art free. With what intent Lorenzo Hath done as he hath done, boots not to know,— But, at the gate, Alfero waits his sentence, If mercy be not shown. Duke. 'Tis not an hour Since further proof hath reached us of his crimes; A treasonous correspondence with the foe Detected, stifles mercy,—he must die By instant execution. [Exit Duke. Elm. O! my friend, This is a fearful night! Jul. More than thou think'st of— But death befriends us—for that wretch's fate Secures Lorenzo, if thy father spare him. Elm. My father spare my husband! Sure I dream, And not on earth; the horrid sounds I hear Are from the spirit of evil. Jul. Nay—be firm; Nor let it shake thee to be told, thy husband May need thy bended knees to save his life. Elm. If to lie prostrate in the grave could add One hour to his existence, I am ready:— But whence this apprehension? Jul. From Arsenio. Elm. I'm glad thou hast not called that man my father, Who persecutes my love,—but how from him? Jul. He may—I know not if he will—but dread it; He may accuse Lorenzo: should he breathe The accusation forth, my friend is sworn Not to survive the shame. Elm. O hold, my heart, For one great effort! Come—the Senate sits, Thither will I this instant. Jul. Canst thou trust Thy strength so far? Elm. I feel a dreadful strength, Past nature, equal to necessity, Like that of gods or fiends: methinks I could Strive with the vigorous hand which fights confusion Upon the border of the elements, And keeps creation safe. I'll snatch my husband— The power is here, in arms; I'll snatch him from An host of foes, though they be fathers all. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Chamber in the Senate House. Enter the Duke and a Senator. Duke. Anon the Senate will in council meet Touching this matter: meanwhile thou acquaint Our venerable brothers with the strange Disclosure of the dying man. Sen. Most truly. Duke. Elmira here again! Sen. I take my leave. [Exit Senator. Enter Elmira and Julio. Elm. Oh! good my lord, behold once more a suitor, Who looks to thee for hope. Duke. I grieve, Elmira, To see thee here,—but justice should not bend In deference to soft humanity. Thus then in brief: Alfero's dying words Accuse Lorenzo of thine uncle's death By poison. Elm. Mighty Heaven! sustain me still! My sight—my sight is clouded! [Falling into Julio's arms. Jul. Pray your grace Defer all comment till another time; You see she cannot bear it. Elm. Yes, I can— I can—and will! Some in their sex find help, The attribute of manhood aiding them— Some in the wisdom and control of years; Some have a kind sustaining in their tempers, Not prone to feel; but I, a woman, weak, And young, and used to melt at other's woe, Have none of these: yet have I some dependence,— It is on Heaven, and on the desperate wrongs That give a desperate courage. Here I stand— The rock is in my bosom. Here I stand, Firm in the cause of justice and my husband. Duke. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not know. Elm. Thou should'st not judge of that thou hast not heard. I say my husband's innocent; his face Attests it: then his known humanity; And, above all—his love, are witnesses Worth troops of swearers. Let his actions speak,— If that indeed you look for truth,—not vengeance,— And mean to punish,—not to sacrifice. Was he a murderer who spared my father, His deadliest foe? Was he a murderer Who spared the very tongue that hath belied His fame?—Again: Was he a murderer Who stooped to own a tender influence When all your terrors failed! and having laughed Your racks and wheels to scorn, bowed down before The image of affection, and surrendered? But wherefore do I prate! Who made the charge? A felon!—Where? Upon the wheel! You thought him Unfit to live, and sent him to the grave! Will you not thrust his slander after him? Duke. Here comes Arsenio; he may tell us more. Enter Arsenio. Duke. Arsenio, my good friend! [Takes him by the hand. Ar. Your highness' servant. Elmira too! (seeing her). Come to thy father's arms! Elm. Yes, to his heart. Oh! how I joy to see thee! My father! hush—a little forward—hush! [Leads him to the front of the Stage. This court of curs'd hypocrisy and falsehood Would rob me of all earthly happiness Under a vile pretext. But thou art kind And good, and wilt not countenance the fraud. They would condemn Lorenzo! Ar. Ha! thank Heaven! Their justice runs before me. I have spurned The villain's plea, and left him with the guards, Here to be dragged for justice! Elm. But a moment; Grant me one moment's conference in private. The Duke will not refuse. Duke. What wouldst thou ask? Elm. To be alone. Duke. We would be just, not cruel, And, therefore, leave you to commune awhile Before Lorenzo comes. From thee, Arsenio, We dread no weak compliance. When the guards Conduct him hither, let him here remain 'Till we return; that if his crime be clear, Our sentence be not slow to visit him. [Exit Duke. Ar. Elmira! Elm. Father! Ar. I can feel for thee Most deeply: nay, I do: but for that man, Whose name shall never more escape these lips, 'Tis vain to plead. Elm. Not so—When he and I Have but one life, and thou hast means to save it— I pray thee, in the name of child, of daughter,— The tenderest name of child,—to change thy purpose. Ar. I hear, and own the tender name thou utter'st, But to the rest am deaf. Nay, if an angel, Clothed in the light of Heaven, had kneeled to me, Revenge should be my answer. Therefore spare Thy unavailing tears. Elm. Another time! Another time! Destroy him not—not now! A bridegroom but this evening! Let him see To-morrow. Ar. In another world he may. Elm. So cruel? Ar. Say—so steadfast. Elm. Call it what Thou wilt, 'tis parricide:—but go, pursue Thy dreadful aim: join hate to hate, and kill him. For, by that Heaven, whose mercy thou blasphem'st, If but a word escape thee to the harm; Nay, or a look, to the disgrace of him I call my husband, this [drawing a dagger].—Ay, tremble now— This dagger drinks my blood. Ar. What would thy madness? Elm. That I have said. Keep off: a stir, and I— Am nothing. Hark! “I hear his chains.” Pronounce My fate before he comes. Ar. Look! [kneeling] on my knees— Elm. Break not my heart, but rise. [As she attempts to raise him, she drops the dagger, and he seizes it. Ar. Thus fortune aids me To vindicate a brother's death, and wreak My vengeance on a dark assassin! Elm. No!— Thou hast, indeed, possessed thee of the steel, The present means of dying; but thou hast not The operation in thy corporal hand To stop the soul's resolve. Then hear my vow:— If he should fall through thee, or with thine aid, Despair shall keep a solemn lent within me! Nor food, nor drink, shall pass those lips, 'till death Arrive, to occupy the house of famine With its chill pomp. Ar. Ha! sworn to starve! Elmira O! thou who mad'st me father, look upon me! Thou mad'st me too a brother, by thy will, And gav'st me once to love him; now to hate His blood-stained enemy. Shall I not use My power to blast this scorpion from my path! O tell me what to do, if thou art nigh! Shall I not hail revenge? 'Tis sweet!—But then— My daughter, in the midst of plenty, starving! Revenge is not my child! She is my child! And she shall guide her father, blind with passion, And find him out repose. [Embraces her. Elm. Heaven!—Heaven will bless thee! Enter Julio, followed by Lorenzo. Jul. Lorenzo comes. Elm. My husband!—Welcome! welcome! Lor. Elmira! sweet Elmira! there is yet One joy 'twixt me and ruin. Elm. And that joy To last through life. Hang not thy head, my father! Look how he smiles forgiveness. Lor. 'Tis too late. Elm. There is no time too late for happiness. Lor. Poor sufferer!—Happiness! Elm. Is it not here? Lor. O! could I turn thy heart to stone, thy veins To lines of marble, where no moisture flows, But damps that never warm, and never feel! 'T were mercy thus to change thee. Elm. Yes; I see— I see it now. Thy cheeks are pale, thy limbs Are trembling. Let me look upon thee! Nearer! Hast thou done this thyself? Lor. What could I do? Accused, reviled; denied all hope of mercy, I drank a healing draught, whose sweetest drop Was that which tasted of oblivion! Elm. Ha! poisoned! Let me catch thee to my soul! And, with an arm of madness, hold thee down To life, while Death and I dispute for thee! The venom shall not kill. [She swoons. Lor. Help me to hold her! For I am weaker than your racks could make me. Ar. Look up, my child! [Supporting her. Lor. How my blood boils! my sinews Crack in the fiery trial. Ha! she wakes. Elm. Hush—do not tell my father we are going To die together, for he has no child But me. Lorenzo—are my senses gone? Oh, no,—they struggle with realities. Come, then, my fainting husband, lean upon Thy wedded bosom—let it be thy grave— 'Tis cold enough. Yet, e'er we sink to rest, Confront those men—declare thine innocence. Lor. My innocence! Elm. Thy purity from blood. Lor. I care not what they say. Elm. But grant to me The bitter consolation, to be sure Thou suffer'st wrongfully. Lor. I must not. Elm. How! Are we more wretched than I thought? Lor. Our woes Have no alleviation. Elm. Is it so? Then welcome to the worst. Lor. Oh! for a spell To shrink and wither up the size of time, That when my shame begins, the world might end, And life, extinct in all its properties, Forget to scorn me. Elm. Is it possible? Lor. Demand no more. Elm. I would not—'tis enough— My heart is broken—Oh! my love, my husband, Let us steal up to heaven together—there My arms shall fold thee, and my voice plead for thee. Nay—closer—'tis so dark—Oh! mercy, mercy! [She dies. Ar. Leave not thine aged father to endure The world alone. Look! is it death that wraps her? Speak once again—but once—'tis all I ask. No sound! no motion! Then 'tis vain to pray; And all my hope is, now, to follow thee. Elmira! must I say farewell? My child! Lor. Dead! dead already! and she drank no poison! But that which shoots its venom thro' the mind— My crime hath killed her. “I forgot one kiss— “The last.” Rinaldo, thou art well revenged! Thy ghost may sleep at midnight—For my wife, And I, are hastening to a bridal bed Thou need'st not envy—Let the grave protect us! [Dies. [Curtain falls to slow Music.] THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, WRITTEN BY A FRIEND, AND SPOKEN BY MRS. EDWIN. Trembling behind the scenes, 'twixt hope and fear, Our agitated Author sends me here; And, while he sits involved in doubtful gloom, Through me—from you his judges—asks his doom. But, ere your judgment on his fate you give, One hint from ME I beg you to receive; His offspring's YOUNG—it is his FIRST indeed, And should it by your warm applause succeed, In each succeeding year, I do assure ye, His LITTLE ONES will find their way to Drury: But if in infancy your frigid pow'r Should nip the bud and blast the rising flow'r, Parent and child, opposed against the storm, Without a friend to raise, or Sun to warm, Must sink unheeded, 'mid rude winter's ire; Neglected wither, and unknown expire. But why these strains? my FORTE, you know, is spirit, Change not to tragic drone my comic merit— As you must do, if you compel me now, With lengthen'd face, and deep contracted brow, To tell him he has fail'd—poor devil, he Could never more with pleasure look at me; But, if consulting character, you choose, To make me bearer of the pleasant news, That he is safe; the part is rightly cast; Where mirth pervades, I hope I'm not the last: For my sake then, as well as his, be kind, And if to spare no better cause you find, Relax the frown that critic wisdom wears, When from ambition's brow the wreath she tears, And deigning to approve, conclude our cause, With gentle mercy, speaking in applause. That sweet applause, whose music charms us more, Than did Apollo's lute the Gods of yore! For whose loud thunder, Writers, Actors vie; Then lend your hands, and let it swell on high, While to our Author with the news I fly!</field>
