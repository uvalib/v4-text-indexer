      <field name="fulltext">Redeunt spectacula.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable, George Whitmore, Lord Maior of this renowned Metrapolis, London.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right VVorshipfull Samuell Cranmer, and Henry Pratt, the two Sheriffs of the Honourable Citty of London, Lately Elected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Rome was erected: at the first establishing of a common weale, Romulus the founder of it, instituted a prime officer to gouerne the Citty, who was cald prÃ¦fectus vrbis, i. the prÃ¦fect of the City, whose vnconroulable authority, had power, not onely to examine, but to determie, all causes &amp; controuersies, &amp; to sit vpon, and censure all delinquents, whether their offences were capitall or criminall: Intra centessimum lapidem, within an hundred miles of the City, in processe of time the Tarquins being expeld, &amp; the prime soueraignty remaining in the consuls. They (by reason of their forraigne imployments) hauing no leasure to administer Iustice at home, created two cheife officers, the one they cald prÃ¦tor vrbanus, or Maior, the other peregrinus: The first had his iurisdiction, in and ouer the Citty, the other excercised his authority meerely vpon strangers. The name PrÃ¦tor is deriued from PrÃ¦essendo or PrÃ¦eundo, from priority of place, which as a learned Roman Author writs, had absolute power ouer all publique and priuat affaires, to make new Lawes, and abolish old, without controwle, or contradiction: His authority growing to that height, that whatsoeuer he decreed or censured in publique, was cald Ius Honorarium, the first on whome this dignity was conferd in Rome, was spur: furius Camillus, the sonne of Marcus: And the first PrÃ¦ter or Lord Maior appointed to the Gouernment of the Honorable Citty of London, was Henry Fitz Allwin, aduaunced to that Dignity, by King Iohn, Anno. 1210. so much for the Honor and Antiquity of the name and place, I proceede to the showes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vpon the water. Are two craggy Rockes, plac'd directly opposit, of that distance that the Barges may passe betwixt them: these are full of monsters, as Serpents, Snakes, Dragons, &amp;c. some spitting Fier, others vomiting water, in the bases thereof, nothing to be seene, but the sad relicks of shipwracke in broken Barkes and split Vessels, &amp;c. The one is cald Silla, the other Charibdis, which is scituate directly against Messana; Scilla against Rhegium: and what soever shippe that passeth these Seas, if it keepe not the middle Channell, it is either wrackt upon the one, or devoured by the other; Medio cutissimus ibit. Vpon these Rocks are placed the Syrens, excellent both in voyce and Instrument: They are three in number, Telsipio, Jligi, Aglaosi; or as others will have them called, Parthenope, skilfull in musicke; Leucosia, upon the winde Instrument; Ligni, upon the Harpe. The morrall intended by the Poets, that whosoever shall lend an attentive eare to their musicke, is in great danger to perish; but he that can warily avoyd it by stopping his eares against their inchantment, shall not onely secure themselves, but bee their ruine: This was made good in Vlisses the speaker, who by his wisedome and pollicy not onely preserved himselfe and his people, but was the cause that they from the rocks cast themselves headlong into the Sea. In him is personated a wise and discreete Magistrate. Vlisses his speech. Behold great Magistrate, on either hand Sands, Shelves, and Syrtes, and upon them stand Two dangerous rocks, your safety to ingage, Boasting of nought save shipwrake spoyle and strage. This Sylla, that Charibdis, (dangerous both) Plac't in the way you rowe to take your oath. Yet though a thousand monsters yawne and gape To ingurdge and swallow you, ther's way to scape; Vlisses by his wisedome found it, steare You by his Compasse, and the way lyes cleare, Will you know how? looke upward then; and sayle By the signe Libra, that Celestiall scale, Jn which (some write) the Sunne at his creation First shone; and is to these times a relation Of Divine Justice: Jt in justice shind, Doe you so (Lord) and be like it divind. Keepe the even Channell, and be neither swayde, To the right hand nor left, and so evade Malicious envie (never out of action,) Smooth visadgd flattery, and blacke mouthd detraction, Sedition, whisprings, murmuring, private hate, All ambushing, the godlike Magistrate. About these rockes and quick sands Syrens haunt, One singes connivence, th'other would inchaunt With partiall sentence; and a third ascribes, Jn pleasing tunes, a right to gifts and bribes; Sweetning the eare, and every other sence, That place, and office, may with these dispence. But though their tones be sweete, and shrill their notes, They come from foule brests, and inpostum'd throats, Sea monsters they be stiled, but much (nay more, 'Tis to be doubted,) they frequent the shoare. Yet like Vlisses, doe but stop your eare To their inchantments, with an heart sincere; They fayling to indanger your estate, Will from the rocks themselves precipitate. Proceede then in your blest Jnauguration, And celebrate this Annuall Ovation; Whilst you nor this way, nor to that way leane, But shunne th' extreames, to keepe the golden meane. This glorious City, Europs chiefest minion, Most happy in so great a Kings dominion: Into whose charge this day doth you invest, Shall her in you, and you in her make blest. The first show by Land, (presented in Pauls The first show by land. Church yard, is a greene and pleasant Hill, adorned with all the Flowers of the spring, upon which is erected a faire and flourishing tree, furnished with variety of faire and pleasant fruite, under which tree, and in the most eminent place of the Hill, sitteth a woman of beautifull aspect, apparrelled like Summer: Her motto, Civitas bene Gubernata, i. a City well governed. Her Attendants (or rather Associats) are three Damsels habited according to their qualitie, and representing the three Theologicall vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charity: Amongst the leaves and fruits of this Tree, are inscerted diverse labels with severall sentences expressing the causes which make Cities to flourish and prosper: As, The feare of God, Religious zeale, a Wise Magistrate, Obedience to rulers, Vnity, Plaine and faithfull dealing, with others of the like nature. At the foot of the Hill sitteth old Time, and by him his daughter Truth, with this inscription; Veritas est Temporis Filia, i. Truth is the Daughter of Time: which Time speaketh as followeth. Tymes speech If Time (some say) have here bin oft in view, Non nova sunt imper, &amp; quod fuit Ante relictum est sit que quod haud fuerat, &amp;c.Yet not the same, old Time is each day new, Who doth the future lockt up houres inlarge, To welcome you to this great Cities charge. Time, who hath brought you hither (grave and great) To inaugure you, in your PrÃ¦torium seate: Thus much with griefe doth of himselfe professe Nothing's more precious, and esteemed lesse. Yet you have made great use of me, to aspire This eminence, by desert, when in full quire Avees and Acclamations, with loud voyce, Meete you on all sides, and with Time rejoyce. This Hill, that Nimph apparreld like the Spring, These Graces that attend her, (every thing) As fruitfull trees, greene plants, flowers of choise smell, All Emblems af a City governd well; Which must be now your charge. The Labels here Mixt with the leaves will shew what fruit they beare: The feare of God, a Magistrate discreete, Iustice, and Equity: when with these meete, Obedience unto Rulers, Vnity, Plaine and just dealing, Zeale, and Industry: Jn such blest symptoms where these shall agree, Cities, shall like perpetuall Summers bee. You are now Generall, doe but bravely lead, And (doubtlesse) all will march, as you shall tread: You are the Captaine, doe but bravely stand To oppose vice, see, all this goodly band Now in their City Liveries will apply Themselves to follow, where your Colours fly. You are the chiefe, defend my daughter Truth, And then both Health and Poverty, Age and Youth, Will follow this your Standard, to oppose Errour, Sedition, Hate, (the common foes.) But pardon Time (grave Lord) who speaks to thee; As well what thou now art, as ought to be. Then Time maketh a pause, and taking up a leavelesse &amp; withered branch, thus proceedeth. See you this withered branch, by Time o're growne A Cities Symbole, ruind, and trod downe. A Tree that bare bad fruit; Dissimulation, Pride, Malice, Envy, Atheisme, Supplantation, Ill Government, Prophannes, Fraud, Oppressi?, Neglect of vertue, Freedome to transgression, Obedience, here with power did disagree, All which faire London be still farre from thee. The second show by land. The second show by Land, is presented in the upper part of Cheapside, which is a Chariot; The two beasts that are placed before it, are a Lyon passant, and a white Vnicorne in the same posture, on whose backs are seated two Ladies, the one representing Justice upon the Lyon, the other Mercy upon the Vnicorne. The motto which Justice beareth, is Rebelles protero; the inscription which Mercy carrieth, is Jmbelles protego: Herein is intimated, that by these types and symboles of Honour (represented in these noble beasts belonging io his Majestie) all other inferiour magistracies and governments either in Common weales, or private Societies, receive both being and supportance. The prime Lady seated in the first and most eminent place of the Chariot, representeth London, behinde whom, and on either side, diverse others of the chiefe Cities of the Kingdome take place: As Westminster, Yorke, Bristoll, Oxford, Lincolne, Exeter, &amp;c. All these are to be distinguished by their severall Escutchons; to them London being Speaker, directeth the first part of her speech as followeth. London the speaker. You noble Citties of this generous Jsle, May these my two each Ladies ever smile. (Justice, and mercy) on you. You we know Are come to grace this our triumphant show. And of your curtesy, the hand to kisse Of London, this faire lands Metropolis. Why sister Cittyes sit you thus amazd? If to behold above you, windowes glas'd With Diomonds 'sted of glasse? Starres hither sent, This day to deck our lower Firmament? Is it to see my numerous Children round Jncompasse me? So that no place is found. Jn all my large streets empty? My yssue spred In number more then stones whereon they tread. To see my Temples, Houses, even all places. With people covered, as Jf, Tyl'd with faces? Will you know whence proceedes this faire increase, This joy? the fruits of a continued peace, The way to thrive; to prosper in each calling, The weake, and shrinking states, to keepe from falling, Serve and obey: the Motto of the Worship. Company of the Habberd.Behold; my motto shall all this display, Reade and observe it well: Serve and obay. Obedience though it humbly doth begin, Jt soone augments unto a Magozin Of plenty, in all Citties 'tis the grownd, And doth like harmony in musicke sound: Nations and Common weales, by it alone Flourish: Jt incorporates, many into one, And makes vnanimous peace content and joy, Which pride, doth still Insidiate to destrsy. And you grave Lord, on whom right honour cals, Both borne and bred i'th circuit of my wals, By vertue and example, have made plaine, How others may like eminence attaine. Persist in this blest concord, may we long, That Citties to this City may still throng, To view my annuall tryumphs, and so grace, Those honored Pretors that supply this place. Next after the Chariot, are borne the two rocks, Sylla and Caribdis, which before were presented upon the water: upon the top of the one stands a Sea Lyon vpon the other a Mearemaide or Sea-Nimphe, the Sirens and Monsters, beeing in continuall agitation and motion, some breathing fire, others spowting water, I shall not neede to spend much time in the Description of them, the wroke being sufficiently able to Commend itselfe. The third shew by Land Presented neere vnto the great Crosle in Cheape-side, beareth the title of the Palace of Honour: A faire and Curious structure archt and Tarrest aboue, on the Top of which standeth Honour, a Glorious presens, and ritchly habited, shee in her speech directed to the right Honorable: the Lord Maior, discouers all the true and direct wayes to attaine vnto her as, first: A King: Eyther by succession or Election. A Souldier, by valour and martiall Discipline A Churchman by Learning and degrees in scooles A Statesman by Trauell and Language &amp;c. A Lord Maior by Commerce and Trafficke both By Sea and Land, by the Inriching of the Kingdome, and Honour of our Nation. The Palace of Honour is thus governed Industry Controwler, his Word Negotior Charity Steward, the Word Miserior. Liberality Treasurer, the Word Largior, Innocence and Deuotion Henchmen the words. Patior: Precor. And so of the rest, and according to this Pallace of Honour is facioned not onely the management of the whole Citty in generall: but the House and Family of the Lord Maior in particular. Before in the Front of this pallace is seated Saint Katherin, the Lady and Patronesse of this Worshipfull Society of whom I will giue you this short Character the name it selfe imports in the Originall. Omnis ruina, which (as some interpret it) is as much as to say, the fall and ruin of all the workes of the Diuell: Others deriue the word from Catena, a Chaine wherein all cheife Vertues and Graces are concatinated and link't together, so much for her name. For her birth, shee was lineally descended from the Roman Emperours, the daughter of Costus the sonne of Constantine which Costns was Crowned King of Armenia, for Constantine hauing conquered that Kingdome, grew Inamored of the Kings Daughter by whom he had Issue, this Costus who after succeeded his Grand Father. Constantine after the death of his first Wife made an expedition from Roome, and hauing Conquered this Kingdome of Great Britaine: he tooke to his Second Wife Helena, which Helena was she that found the Crosse vpon which the Sauiour of the World was Crucified, &amp;c. Costus Dying whilst Katherine was yet young, and shee being all that Time liuing in Famogosta, (a cheife City because shee was there Proclaimed and Crowned was called Queene of Famogosta, she liued and dyed a Virgin and a Martyr vnder the Tiranny of Maxentius, whose Empresse, with many other great &amp; eminent persons she had before conuerted to the Faith. So much for her character Her speech to the Lord Maior as followeth. [Katherine.] I Katherin, long since Sainted for true piety, The Lady patronesse of this Society, A queene, a Virgin, and a Martir: All My Atributes: Inuite you to this Hall Cald Honours pallace: nor is this my Wheele, Blind Fortunes Embleame, she that makes to reele; Kingdomes and Common weales, all turning round, Some to aduance, and others to Confound: Mine is the Wheele of Faith, (all wayes in motion) Stedfast in Hope, and Constant in Deuotion. Jt Imitates the Spheres swift agitation, Orbicularly, still mouing to Saluation: That's to the Primus motor: from whom Flowes, All Goodnesse, Vertue: There, true Honour growes, Which: If you will attaine t'must be your care. (Graue Magistrate.) Jnstated as you are. To keepe this Curoular action, in your charge, To Curbe the' opressor, the opprest to inlarge; To be the Widdowes Husband, th' Orphants Father, The blindmans eye, the lame mans fool: so gather (A treasure beyond valew, by your place; More then Earths Honour,) trew CÃ¦lestiall grace, Ayme first at that: what other Honors be, Honour Herselfe can best Instruct thats shee. At that word shee poynteth vpward to a Glorious presens which personates Honor in the top of the pallace, who thus secondeth Saint Katherens Speech. Honours Speech. The way to me though not debard, Yet it is dificult and hard. If Kings Arriue to my profection Tis by Succession, or Election When Fortitude doth Action grace, The Souldier then with me takes place When Stooddy, Knowledge and degree Makes Scollers Eminent heere with mee; They are listed with the Honored: and The Trauilar, when many a land He hath 'peir'st for language, and much knowes A great respected statesman growes. So you and such as you (Graue Lord) Who weare this Scarlet, vse that Swoord Collar, and Cap of Maintenance. These are no things, that come by chance Or got by sleeping but auerse From these I am paind: by care, Commerce, The hazarding of Goods, and men To Pyrats Rocks, shelues, Tempest, when? You through a Wildernesse of Seas, Dangers of wrack, Surprise, Desease Make new descoveryes, for a lasting story Of this our Kingdomes fame and Nations glory Thus is that Collar, and your Scarlet worne, And for such cause, the Sworde before you Borne. They are the emblems of your Power, and heere Though curb'd within the Linemet of one yeare, Yet manadge as they ought by your Indeuour Shall make your name (as new) Honored for euer Vnto which Pallace of peace, rest and blisse, Supply of all things, where nought wanting is Would these that shall succcede you know the way? Tis plaine, God, the King Serue and Obay. I cannot heare forget that in the presentment of my papers to the Master, Wardens, &amp; Committies of this Right Worshipfull Company of the Haberdashers (at whose sole expence and charges all the publick Triumphes of this dayes Solemnity both by water and land, were Celebrated) nothing here deuised or expressed was any way forraigne vnto them, but of all these my conceptions, they were as able to Iudge, as ready to Heare, and to direct as well as to Censure; nether was there any dificulty which needed a comment, but as soone known as showne, and apprehended as read: which makes me now confident of the best ranke of the Cittisens: That as to the Honour and strength both of the Citty and Kingdome in generall, they excercise Armes in publicke, so to the benefit of their Iudgements, and inriching of their knowledge, they neglect not the studdy of arts, and practise of literature in priuate, so that of them it may be truly said they are, Tam Mercurio quam Marte periti: I proceede now to the last Speech at night in which Vlisses at the taking leaue of his Lordship at his Gate, vseth this short Commemoration, of all that hath bin included in the former pageants, poynting to them in order, the manner thereof thus. [Ulisses.] Night growes, Inuiting you to rest, prepare To rise to morrrw to a whole Yeares care, Enuy still waites on Honour, then prouide Vlisses Wisdome may be still your guide To stere you through all dangers: Husband Time That this day brings you to a place sublime, By the Supporture of his daughter Truth This Ancient Citty in her pristine Youth, Your sword may reestablish: and so bring Her still to florish; like that lasting Spring That London in whose Circuit you were bred And borne therein, to be the Cheife and Head Drawne by these two beasts in an Equall line May in your Mercy and your Iustice shine. So Honour who this day did you Inuite Vnto Her palace bids you thus Good Night. No following day but adde to your Renowne And this your Charge, with numerous Blessings crowne. I haue forborne to spend much paper in neede lesse and Inpertinent deciphering the worke, or explaining the habits of the persons, as being freely exposed to the publicke view of all the Spectators. The maine show, being performed by the most excellent in that kind, Miaster Gerard Christmas hath exprest hia Modals to bee exquisite (as hauing spared nei-ther Cost nor care, either in the Figures or ornaments. I shall not neede to point vnto them to say, this is a Lyon, and that an Vnicorne, &amp;c. For of this Artist, I may bouldly and freely thus much speake, though many about the towne may enuie their worke, yet with all their indeuor they shall not be able to compare with their worth. I Conclude with Plautus in sticho: Nam curiosus est nemoqui non fit male volus. FINIS.</field>
