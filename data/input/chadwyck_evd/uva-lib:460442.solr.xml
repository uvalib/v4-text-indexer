      <field name="fulltext">OSMAN: AN HISTORICAL TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. It is almost unnecessary to inform the Readers, that the Tragedy in this Collection is founded on a Catastrophe, which happen'd at Constantinople in the Year 1624; and that the Unities of the Drama are not attended to: Its many Imperfections are submitted to their Candour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable Lord BLAKENEY. My Lord, I Have the Honour of addressing this Performance to your Lordship, as presiding over the Laudable Order of Antigallicans; perhaps, the most laudable so of any at this Time existing; an Order of the best Institution; calculated for Ends of the highest Importance: I need not expatiate; its Title implies it, its Motto evinces it, its Laws enforce it; to oppose the Interest and Designs of France, and to discountenance her Manufactures, being the Basis of its Institutionâan Institution, at this Crisis of Time particularly, the most eminent. To be an Antigallican, my Lord, implies every Thing great; a Lover of our Countryâan Enemy to France, as her inveterate Foe: We have for a long Series of Years been blessed with the Enjoyment of Peace and Property; how long this happy Scene may exist, or how soon we may be involved in those Calamities, which the Regions around us feel, and which we are so happy only to hear off, is yet reserved in the Book of Fate; which Calamities, I flatter myself, by Divine Assistance, are greatly in our Power, as Antigallicans, to avert; were we hearty, zealous, and indefatigable in our Country's Cause; like the fam'd Spartans of old at the Straits of ThermpylÃ¦, we might make a noble Stand, and save her in the most perilous Time: This, my Lord, may be looked on as an Hyperbole; but as our Plan might be greatly improved, I conceive it is not impracticable: A red Coat, my Lord, does not make a Man brave; in order to it, may Courage, Virtue, and Publick Spirit, be the distinguishing Characteristics of every Antigallican; may our Songs be martial; may our Admission of Members be seriously attended to, and their Initiation strongly enforced; and that the Order of Antigallicans, may long flourish under the Auspices of Lord Blakeney, is the ardent Desire of a Brother, and, my Lord, Your Lordship's Most obedient humble Servant, Cornelius Arnold.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Camp. Enter Aga and Lieutenant of the Janizaries, meeting. AGA. Good-day, Lieutenant! Sir, what News abroad? LIEUTENANT. They talk of Peace; the Sword will soon be sheath'd. Know you the Cause, the Reasons, noble Sir? AGA. Many assign'dâ'Tis said, his Highness brooks But ill our Order, matching not his Spirit: Is it not strange, my Friend! that one so young, Should thus outstrip us in the Race of Glory; Should still be foremost in each bold Emprise, Each hardy ToilâO! how it shameth those, Lolling inglorious on their Mother's Lap, Or in soft Dalliance trifling with the Fair; While Osman in the Field performs such Deeds, The bravest Veteran would be proud to own. LIEUTENANT. Surely, a matchless Youth! Name but the Task Which Honour stamps, he wou'd atchieve, or fall In the Attemptâand still his Courtesy Adds Lustre to his SwordâI have been told, E're the eighth annual Sun roll'd o'er his Head, As many Languages did grace his Tongue. AGA. 'Tis true; in Science as in Valourâgreatâ Whene'er he talks of State perplex'd Affairs, Fond Admiration holds the Hearer muteâ Of Warâeach feeble Arm is brac'd for Battle. But O the Day! had you but mark'd the Youth, When with his single Arm, alone, unaided; Dauntless he stemm'd the Tide of furious Warâ Curse on our coward Corps! they wou'd not rally, Not back their Emperor, who onward press'd, And bravely snatch'd the Laurel from the Foe. LIEUTENANT. Amazement at his Prowess, noble Aga! Their Faculties suspendedâShield him, Heaven! We ne'er were bless'd with such a PrinceâFarewel, Most worthy Aga! AGA. Farewel, Lieutenant! [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. The Sultan's Pavilion in his Camp. Osman sitting, reading a Paper. OSMAN. It shall be soâThis beauteous Woman's Form [Rises. Unbends Attention to the Call of Gloryâ All my Resolves of Fortitude are vainâ The Poles shall then have Peaceâand I'll return VictoriousâButâin Aphendina's Loveâ âHer Soul's a Stranger to the Art of Flatteryâ One Set of Principles infus'd in both, Under her pious Father's Institution, Is the unrav'lling Clue by which we trace The Maze and Windings of each other's Heart. âHow oft do I reflectâpleasing Review! When as yet Children in our wonted Sports, I cou'd not brook to gain Advantage o'er herâ Oft wou'd in Exercise retard my Force, Rather than vanquish where she'd lose the Prizeâ Nor could she joy for any Victory, Equal to that I acquiesc'd to grant herâ How would the Blush rise mantling on her Cheek! The sweet Confusionâ [Enter Ashad. ASHAD. Let not, Sir, your Slave Break in upon his Lord unseas'nablyâ If so, command me henceâ OSMAN. Your coming's opportune; I'm but perusing of the late Dispatch Your Daughter sent meâfaithful Aphendina! She loves me, Mufti, sues for my Return, And I'm resolv'd to honour her Request. Too many Reasons bias me to Peace: The dastard Carriage of my Janizaries Hath been apparent thro' this whole Campaignâ Of strong Inforcement thisâYet this weighs light With the Affection which I bear your Daughterâ ASHAD. Her Happiness therein exceeds Proportionâ Nor shall it stain your Glory, Sir, to grant Recess from Arms to the Vanquish'd: I've advis'dâ Nay, urg'd the Vizier to conclude the Peaceâ OSMAN. Father! My Glory's still your prime Regardâ Your Conduct I approveâPrinces never Shine more conspicuous than in Clemencyâ To overcome the Lust of Pow'rs Extentâ To restore Kingdoms to their Lord subdued, Proclaim a noble Soul, and rank us higher Than the bare Conquest of th'Earth could raise us. [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. The Camp. Two Officers of the Janizaries. First OFFICER. Once more we've Hope to see the Porte again; The Vizier's on the Spur to sign the Treatyâ Osman, neglecting too his Thirst for Arms, Grows hourly more impatient to decampâ All Articles are settledâand e'en now The Deputies attend at the Divan, To ratify in Form a solid Peaceâ Second OFFICER. I'th'North perhapsâbut e're we reach the Porte, The Head of Osman will have form'd new Projects, To drain his Empire, and consume his Forces. First OFFICER. I fear some other Schemes engage his Mindâ You've heard how he digested our Defeatâ How he exclaimed against our Cowardice, (So free to term it thus.)âCan he imagine Our Lives of so mean Value, to be lavish'd In careless Pastime at our Leader's Nod, Without an Argument to push us onâ What did the Poles to us, or our Allies, That should demand th'Effusion of this Blood?â Mere hot-brain'd Frenzy!âHave we not lost thousands?â Wasted our Strength in traversing steep Mountains! In passing Rivers at the utmost Peril! And all to gratify a Child's Ambitionâ Second OFFICER. The Sultan's present Treatment of our Order, Treasures Disgust in ev'ry wary Breast. When I approach'd him for the Nightly Word, His low'ring Brow, collected to Resentment, Flashing Contempt and Indignation at me, Bespoke the inward Rancor of his Soulâ âI dread the Consequence at our Returnâ But see, th'EmbassadorsâThe Treaty's sign'dâ And they're in March t'his Highness's Pavilion. SCENE IV. The Camp. Zoravinze, Sobieski, and two Joint Deputies, with their Train. ZORAVINZE. We must remit the Article of Decampment To the Grand Signior's own Determinationâ The Prospect of our famish'd Troops, may raise New Difficulties to retard the Peace; Excite our Enemies to fresh Resolves, And finally complete our Overthrowâ SOBIESKI. Our General Lubomirski this foreseeing, Order'd the Cossacks to repass the River, Where from the Mountains you behold their Tents; And Osman's Camp resounds with our Retreatâ This Article will therefore prove no Barâ What else they can demand, we shall accord. ZORAVINZE. That Artifice may save our Creditâ SOBIESKI. Doubt it notâ SCENE V. The Sultan's Pavilion. The Capigy Bassa, and his Corps with Maces, preceding the Embassadors, pass and repass the Stage, 'till they come to the Hall of Audience, which opening, discovers the Sultan on his Throne. The Mufti, Vizier, Beglerbegs, Bassas, on each Hand; Registers fronting it: They are presented to the Sultan, and kiss his Robe. Sobieski delivers the General's Letter to the Junior of the Bassas, who hand it from one to another, so to the Vizier, who, on his Knee, lays it on a Cushion before the Throne. VIZIER. His Highness is prepar'd to hear your Excellencies. ZORAVINZE. Most mighty LordâRenowned Osman! Our gracious Master's Aim hath ever been, To cultivate firm Friendship with your Highness; Transmitting Deputies amidst his Forces, As well prepar'd for Terms of Peace, as War. Thisâhaving rag'd, till Death itself was gorg'd: Thatâthro' the prudent Conduct of your Vizier, Now lays us prostrate at your Highness's Feet; Craving a Confirmation of our Happinessâ Whilst here we swear the punctual Execution Of every Clause on our great Lord's Behalf; Nor question we, its sacred Conservation, From you, illustrious Sir! in whom combin'd Each generous Virtue of your Ancestors, With matchless Lustre eminently shineâ We dread, great Sir! t'approach your Majesty, Devoid of Off'rings worthy your Acceptanceâ Your rich Dominions, and extensive Rule, Prevent our adding to your Highness' Treasures: But Love and Dread are equally discern'dâ In lowest as in highest Things, regarding The Disposition of the Offererâ Whilst here in Arms, far from our native Homes, War's Instruments proclaim our only Richesâ Accept these, Sir, as Symbols of Affectionâ [Presents two Silver Javelins, &amp;c. May all your Enemies by them subdued, In Prosecution of your Highness' Glory, Bring daily to your Mind the friendly Poles. OSMAN. My Lords, with Pleasure we confirm this Peace; Your Presents we acceptâand Sulisczouiiâ T'attend our Person to the royal Porte. I hear your Forces are repassing Tyreâ 'Tis wellâor I had urg'd it to be done. [The Embassadors retreat backwards, and the Scene closes upon the Room of Audience. SCENE VI. The Sultan's Tent. Osman, Vizier, and Soldiers. OSMAN. Vizier, give Orders for our speedy March; I mean t'encamp at ChoczimâStrike the Tents; Let nought remain by the Ninth Hour of Day. Have my Commands brought the Sultana Queen, And Prince my Son?âHave you (as suits) prepar'd Triumphal Entry for us at the Porte? You've heard my WillâretireâI would be privateâ Too lovely Maid!âIllustrious Aphendina! [Sultan rises. This short Recess I consecrate to Theeâ Thy Charms have Power beyond the Force of Glory; Nor can I muse on any Arms but thineâ How am I rapt to contemplate the Joy Thou wilt receive on News of my Return!â At thy Command too, for in Truth 'tis so, Whate'er Disguises I've been forc'd to wear, To palliate this hasty Change for Peace: But I'll advise thee of it instantly. [Sits to write. What shall I say to shew how much I love? âIdeas crowd so thick upon my Mind, That like a routed Multitude they press, Nor can pervade the Portals of the Senseâ Is it impossible for me to pen, What I could breathe into her Soul, if presentâ It must be soâthen take, dear Ravisher! The Heart itself, o'erladen with thy Praises: I will but therefore say I loveâand leave theeâ [Folds the Letter, and Exit. SCENE VII. Abroad. Two Officers of the Spahis. First OFFICER. This Eagerness to turn our Faces home, Exceeds the Preparations for the War: My Men have scarcely loaded all the Beasts, But they must mount unfed, and quit the Field. Second OFFICER. 'Tis true; we've had a toilsome Task to-day: But cloudy Visages and buzzing Murmurs, Distract my Mind with Sense of future Ills. It is amazing to behold a City (For lesser Name can't comprehend our Camp) Of vast Extent, shining in pompous Pride, At the Third Hour of Day, depopulated, Raz'd to the Ground, no Traces left behind, All in full March, Miles from its Situationâ E're the same Sun, which found it flourishing, Hath three Fourths pass'd of his Diurnal Arch. First OFFICER. The Sight is strange; but why this urgent Speed? This sudden Change in Osman's Resolution? Had but his Highness study'd Victory, No Time like this hath ever been afforded: The Polanders and Cossacks press'd with Famine, Grown sickly and consum'd with three-fold Toil, Are scarce a twentieth Part effective Menâ Then why this Speedâthis, I may almost say, This Flight precipitate from certain Conquest? Second OFFICER. Sure, thour't inform'd of Osman's old Amour Wi'th'Mufti's DaughterâBeauteous Ashada Still claims her Conquest o'er the Sultan's Will. He's young and amorous, and can't withstand The Force of LoveâTho' such a Prize as this, Might warm the Heart of the most rigid Derviseâ But see, our Troops are on the Stretch to Choczim, And we must wing it after them apace. SCENE VIII. Camp at Choczim. Mirza and Phesalie. MIRZA. Propound no Comfort to my tortur'd Mind; 'Twere endless to engage in such a Taskâ Observ'd you not the affected Complaisance He forc'd upon himself? âMadam, you're welcomeâ âNo Happiness subsists without Allayâ âYour Messenger informsâIv'e lost my Sonâ âI'm sorry for itâbut we all are mortalâ âYou'll make your Entry with me to the Porteââ I had prepar'd a Thousand tender Things, To 'suage th'expected Sorrow for his Son, And raise Affection in his Breast for me. I languish'dâlook'dâoft I essay'd to speak, But turning from me with contemptuous Air, He gave Command a Chiaoux should attend, On some Dispatch, I know not what, and left me. PHESALIE. My Queen, you injure Osman by these Thoughts; He's just arriv'd from the Fatigues of War; A busy World engrosses all his Careâ It's plain, 'tis not Neglect makes him indifferent; For had his Mind been vacant from Engagements, No doubt his Son had forc'd some Sorrow from him. MIRZA. Alas! my SonâThence, thence my Source of Woeâ Had he but liv'd!â Some fresh Amour m'engage my Osman's Heart, And send me wretched, childless to the Graveâ Our only Hopes are built upon an Heirâ They're goneâthey're vanishedâMirza is now Despis'd, neglected, and the Queen's no more. PHESALIE. Madam, you're young, and may have many Sons T'engage our Sov'reign's Heart by stronger Ties. MIRZA. Name that no more, dear Phesalie; my Grief Would then exceed its present Limits farâ O! could I live to see my eldest Hope Secure his Sceptre by a Brother's Blood!â The captious Soldiery are so imperious, That while a Branch remains o'th'Ott'man Stem, To fill his Place, no King can sit secure: For tho' they durst not quite dam up the Spring, They dread not to divert it from its Course. Which Way soe'er I turn, I meet Distressâ Unhappy childlessâlost, if more than one. PHESALIE. 'Tis true, your Majesty with Danger treads The Ice-glaz'd Path of slipp'ry Greatness: But Custom, reaching out her friendly Hand, Sould reconcile to Reasons of the State: Nor ought we sorrow, till th'Event arrives. Might I presume to advise your Highness, It should be to shake off this Heavinessâ Resume the gay, the bright, the sparkling Mirza; (The Charms which first subdu'd the Sultan's Heart) They may rekindle Osman's waining Love; Still make you Mother of his first-born Son, And spite of your Dejection, Valida Mother of the Sultan's first Son.. MIRZA. I know you love meâI will be advis'd: Our Prophet aid meâYet, I know not why, I feel a Trembling seize upon my Heart, Which, maugre my Resolves, bodes ill Success. [Exeunt. SCENE IX. Osman's Tent. Sultan sealing a Letter. To him Ashad. OSMAN. Father! I'm sending to my Aphendina. ASHAD. I just receiv'd Commands to attend your Highness. OSMAN. I sent the Vizier, for a Conference with you. You know, my Father, my Design to enter Constantinople's Gates, in martial Triumph. ASHAD. I do, my Lord, and all Things are preparing, In the most pompous Guise, t'advance your Glory; The Vizier's noble Soul hath e'en exceeded Rome's antient Pomp in forming for the Eye, And ev'ry Sense, Gratification infinite; Nor is aught wanting fully to illustrate Consummate Grandeur and Magnificence. OSMAN. You seem to think the Pageantry complete, That no Addition can extend its Prospect; You err, my Father, 'tis a Trifle allâ I've seen the Vizier's Plan, admit it great; But still it suits not with his Emp'ror's Soulâ I have a View beyond Dilaver's Reach, To introduce a so much more superb And glorious Scene, as shall eclipse the rest, And of itself alone compose a Triumph; Nayâe'en your Sultan grace it as a Captive. ASHAD. I know your Majesty, as by your Station, Aloft remov'd above your humble Slaves, So no less by your Genius and Discernment: But still, my King's mysteriousânor can I, With utmost Penetration, sound the Depth Of his DesignsâOr what can add such Grandeur To Dilaver's Device, that all should seem To wait on that, my Emperor in viewâ OSMAN. 'Tis thy fair Daughter, Mufti, Aphendina! I mean to have her drawn in open Chariot, That all the World may hail the Sultan's Choice. And should she hint it, follow as her Slave; This Letter is to bring her to my Camp; Should her nice Virtue form no Scruple to it, And that she may not, I have sent for you, Desiring your Permission, to oblige meâ She'll not decline Obedience to her Father. ASHAD. My Lord, your Highness' Bounty to my Daughter Reflects the highest Honour on your Slave, And claims the gratefullest Returns from both. âShould aught arise from Aphendina's Conduct, To give the least Displeasure to my Lord, Charge the old Man with all the Blame, not her; She's young, unpractis'd in the World, and forms All her Resolves from Principles infus'd In earlier Days by meâYour Highness knows, My sole Delight hath been, t'imbue alike Your Mind and her's with Virtue's strictest Precepts; She keeps severely to the rigid Letter; Then blame not herâthose Scruples you call nice, Arising only from the Dread of Error. Your Majesty shall be obey'dâI'll let her know, It is your Pleasure and my Will she comes. [Mufti writes, musing. OSMAN. I thank you, Father! Send me a Courier. [Exit Mufti, and enter Courier. Away with these Dispatches to the Mufti's; Into his Daughter's Hand deliver this: When she has read itâThisâobserve her Looks At each Delivery, and return with Speed. COURIER. I shall, my Lord. OSMAN. Without there, who attends? [Enter Vizier. VIZIER. Great Sir, your Slaveâ OSMAN. Dispatch two hundred Horse T'escort the Mufti's Daughter to our Presence; Let them conduct her to her Father's Tent: Be instant thenâ [Exit Vizier. Mirza's disconsolate! Would she were notâbut she is mine no moreâ Nor shall I grieve the parting from my Boy, If lovely Aphendina brings me one. I must possess her, but use no Constraint; Nayâshould she ne'er comply, I can't compell: What View have Men in Love, but to engage The charming Object, by all winning Arts And gentle Means, to render Love again? Avaunt Constraint! thou art a Contradiction; Love but consists of Generosityâ I know my Pow'r to forceâ'tis base to use it. I'll once more tryâtho' oft I've been repuls'd. If she will enter my Seraglio, She shall have new created Honours paid her. I will engage eternal Constancy: For her alone, I'll the whole Sex resign, And only live while Aphendina's mine.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Sultana Queen's, near Constantinople. Mirza, Phesalie, and Ladies Attendants. MIRZA. The Mask is now thrown offâMirza no longer Reign's in her Sov'reign's HeartâCruel Reverse! O Flattery, curst Flatt'ry! Thou'st undone meâ Ye crouching Sycophants! constant Attendants On ev'ry rising Star, ye've undone me; Ye puft your pois'nous Blasts into my Senses, Till Pride had swell'd me to the matchless Creature, Your servile serpent Tongues reported me, As worthy of great Osman's constant Love. O Phesalie! my Spring of Glory's faded, I'm lostâfor ever lost to Love and Osman. PHESALIE. Who could have apprehended such a Change? MIRZA. That Part was mine; but giddy Joys prevented. 'Twas I receiv'd his Virgin Obligations; Nor has he ever yet been false to me: Mirror of Constancy! compar'd with Emperors, Whose Wills insatiate have roam'd at large. Had he done thus, I'd been like other Odalisks One of the Sultan's Mistresses. Enjoy'd, repudiated, without a Sigh; But elevate with Hope of Love's Endurance, My Fall precipitate the more confounds meâ First LADY. Is't certain, this fair Lady, Aphendina's Conducted hither to the Sultan's Bed? Second LADY. So the Report; the Camp resounds with it. PHESALIE. This Love is not of Yesterday's Creation; This is a smother'd Flame, burst out againâ MIRZA. Or rather never smother'dâMy Reflections Recall to Mind Scenes past Reiteration; When in my Arms the noble Osman slumber'd, Oft would he start, and catch, and waking, sighâ Then slumb'ring, groan again, whole Nights together. I might have thought of Aphendina then; But my own Joys were so superlativeâ First LADY. Hark! 'tis the Sound of Trumpets in the Camp. [Trumpets sound. Second LADY. They sound againâand nearer too. [Sound again. MIRZA. O! hide me, 'Tis this new MistressâCover me, ye Mountainsâ Conceal my just Confusion in your Bowels, And never more let Mirza see the Light. PHESALIE. Too true, I fear, these Sounds proclaim the Joy Of her Arrival. MIRZA. Close my TentâI'm ill, And must be privateâSure Osman won't impose On me the hateful Task of Gratulation. [Scene closes. SCENE II. The Mufti's Tent. Aphendina enters at one Door, Ashad at the other; the Attendants cross the Stage, and leave them. ASHAD. Our Prophet succour thee, my dearest Child; [Embracing. Confirm thy Virtue, and thy Innocence. APHENDINA. Alas! my Father; pardon my Surprize And Ecstacy at meeting you again, After an Absence never known before; It adds new Life and Vigour to my Spirits, And spreads abundant Joy o'er all my Senses. ASHAD. A Word, my Daughter: You receiv'd my Letter, Together with the Sultan's? APHENDINA. Sir, I did; And in Compliance with them both, am here. ASHAD. You're prudent, DaughterâYou've had good Instructions: Let them not fail you in the Time of Trial. Be virtuous, ChildâYou know the Sultan's Power: I say be virtuousâor be no more. [Exit Ashad. Enter Sultan and Attendants, who pass: He runs to her. [Musick without. OSMAN. Thou blooming Maid! this Meeting glads my Soul. APHENDINA. Most mighty Emperor! your high Command Hath brought your meanest Slave to kiss your Feet. [Going to embrace her, she kneels. My best Acknowledgments fall short in Worth Of noble Osman's Favour to his Handmaid. OSMAN. Arise, my Fair One! 'tis too mean for you [Raises her. To prostrate even to the Sultan's Person. You I esteem my EqualâAll to you Shall with like Ardour bend, as to myself; But you to no ManâMay I be resolv'd? Does thy fond Heart dilate with rising Joy, And bound with Ecstasy at Osman's Name? Say, do'st Thou love?âThy Blush confest it once. APHENDINA. If t'have known aught, when you were absent from me, Save joyless Days, and ever restless Nights; If Pray'rs, and Sighs, and Wishes for your Safety, Haunting Reposeâoft forc'd the starting Tear: If these were Love, if these the Lover's Pangs, I then avow the Flame; with Joy confess, The Grave itself can't extirpate my Passion. OSMAN. Kind Heav'n then smiles upon the happy Osman! [Kneeling, kisses her Hand. I can no moreâStill love me, Aphendina! APHENDINA. My Emperor at my Feet! It must not be. Sir, you confound me by this Condescension: I cannot suffer it. OSMAN. My Love, I rise. But, O! declare, what Transports fill thy Breast, When my fond Breathings tell thee, Osman loves. APHENDINA. Could I delineate the Joys of Paradise, Then might I paint thy Aphendina's Bliss. How has my Soul been shock'd! when tortur'd Fancy, Presenting to my View the hostile Field, I saw your Highness foremost in the Ranks, Amid the Din and Tumult of the War! Your innate Valour might have led you on To some destructive Enterprize, and robb'd The Worldâand Aphendina of her Osman. OSMAN. The Recollection of thy matchless Graces Caus'd such an Alteration in your Osman, As spite of my own Glory, sav'd the Poles. Yes, Aphendina, you have fix'd a Crown Upon the tottering Head of Sigismond, With more Security than Conquest could. Your Letter pressing my Return, subdu'd me, Concluded Peace, and bent me to the Porte, To reap the grateful Harvest of thy Love. I'd Thoughts, my Fair! you should have triumph'd with me; But I shall now dismiss you from the Camp; You shall not enter the Imperial City In my Retinue, least it should be said, I sought this only Treasure of my Soul To grace the Entry of Sultana Queenâ But know, my Aphendina, Osman follows, Wholly devoted to your future Happiness. [Exit Aphendina. Let but the Woman whom we love appear, What dastard Souls are might'est Conquerors! Why did I send for Aphendina hither, But to behold her Beauty, praise her Charms, Declare my Love, and try my Art to win her, By soft Address, to enter my Seraglio? What then prevented off'ring this Proposal, But Dread of disobliging her I love? By Mahomet! I'd face a Cannon sooner, And grasp the Ball just firing at my Breast, Than urge to her what she may not approve. âThis Suspence destroys me; but e're the Sun Has, in his wonted Course, revisited The Western World, my Fate shall be decided. [Exit. SCENE III. The Seraglio. Mirza and Phesalie. MIRZA. I've heard too much of it already, Phesalie, My Palace, say you? rather call it my Dungeon; My Joys are wholly center'd in the Sultan. Where is the Love, at least the Complaisance, He ever shew'd, when absent but a Day? He never fail'd to visit me the first; Now two long tedious Hours have been consum'd In fruitless Waitingâ'Twas not always thus. PHESALIE. My Queen, Imagination oft misleads, Paints in so lively Colours fancied Ills, That even Doubts are heighten'd into Truths. MIRZA. Call not a Doubt what's too, too evident: He bore himself so lofty at the Camp, He scarcely deign'd to cast an Eye toward me. [Enter Kiosem. KIOSEM. I may intrude perhapsâYou seem engag'd? Can Mirza pardon my Officiousness? MIRZA. Kiosem, ever welcome, can't intrude; The Niceties of Time lose all Distinction, In Friendships so cemented as our own. KIOSEM. My Queen! your Goodness over-runs my Thanks; Something of private Import may forbid; Permit me to retire. MIRZA. No, Stay, my Kiosem; Only what busy babbling Fame reports, Furnishes hateful Matter for our Theme. KIOSEM. Forgive me, Mirza, if I guess the Subject: 'Tis just as I suspected; his Intent Was only to decoy th'imperious Thing, The lofty Aphendina to his Lure: On her he lavishes the rich Profuse, Vouchsafing you a Pittance of his Love. MIRZA. Heavens! Can I pass such Disregard unmov'd, And tamely sink beneath this Load of Insult! KIOSEM. 'Tis plain, he's glad the Prince your Son is dead, T'abrogate your Pow'r with more Facility, And raise his towering Mistress on your Ruin: But let the giddy Creature swell with Pride, Your Majesty's Appearance will eclipse her, Unless, to save the Minx's Reputation, You are forbid the Presence, or confin'd. MIRZA. I dread th'Event; Heav'n only knows my Fate! KIOSEM. And should know her's, were I Sultana Queen; Madam, you bear your Wrongs too patiently: Exert your Influence, he'll repent his Change: Spread Whispers of the Sultan's bad Designs; Her private FavoursâStir up the Odalisks To apparent Slights; disperse your Emissaries Among the Soldiery; leave nought untry'd, Your Injuries demand Redressâbe resolute. MIRZA. I'm much indebted to my Kiosem's Zeal; Her Words revive the Languor of my Hopes: As the firm Buttress, with benign Support, Sustains the Glories of some Memphian Pile; So Kiosem's Friendship stays my threatn'd Fall, And guards her Mirza from impending Ruin. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Royal Apartments. Osman sitting musing. OSMAN. E'er I repose, I'll try this charming Maid; Her firm Adherence to the Cause of Virtue Inflames my restless Soul with fierce Desire, More pungent than the Scenes of foul Debauchery Could ever raise i'th'most abandon'd Breast; And I must compass her at all Events. I'd willingly not thwart the Empire's Laws, Which do inhibit Marriage to the Sultan; But better they were cross'd, than I undoneâ I'll offer her whate'er Ambition's Lust, Whate'er unbounded Luxury can crave; And if her Virtue's Proof 'gainst these Temptations, She's only qualified to grace my Throne, And nuptial Rites shall constitute her Empress. [Exit. SCENE V. Apartment in the Seraglio. KIOSEM sola. To what End serve myself corroding Cares? Whilst Osman gains th'Affection of the Court, The Populace, and ev'ry OrderâAmurath, My Son, neglected, dreams away his Life, Or immaturely fallsâfor fall he must, E'er Osman's Head can hold his Crown secure: Then what if I by subtile Stratagem, To save my Amurath, bring Death on Osman; The Janizaries, cover'd with Disgrace, Resent his Treatment in the late Campaignâ I'll fix my Spies, observe their ev'ry Action, Sow Discord by Degrees, fill them with Terror, And raise 'twixt him and them such Jealousy, As from the slightest Rumour may be blown, (By adding proper Fuel) to Rebellion. Then this new Mistress stings me to the Soul; Her Temper may drive Osman to Extremities.â Mirza's my own; I mould her pliant Nature; But should this Favourite, this Aphendina Prevail against her, I'm reduc'd indeedâ If Amurath reigns, the Pow'r is lodg'd with me: If OsmanâPerish th'abject, dastard Thought! Better meet Death, attempting Sov'reignty, Than linger Life in absolute Subjection: For Life's no Life for me, devoid of Power. [Enter Bassa of Bosnia O! ever welcome, dearest Friend, Bassa! Your Presence dissipates my CaresâA Spirit So adequate as yours to great Designs, May raise your Princess 'bove the Frowns of Fate. BASSA. Madam, you may commandâ KIOSEM. Attend me, Bassa! [Exeunt. SCENE VI. The Mufti's Palace. Osman, Ashad, and Aphendina. ASHAD. Your Highness overloads my House with Honours; I leave you, Sir; but good, my Lord, rememberâ [Exit Mufti. OSMAN. Urg'd by my Passion for thy heav'nly Form, Adorn'd with Virtues, ev'ry Excellence, Behold an humble Suitor in your Osman. âAccord, my Aphendina, to my Viewsâ Abate the Rigour of the Mufti's Precepts, In my Apartments (Treasury of Blessings) Command whate'er can gratify Desire. I come not now, my Love, to be refus'd, But to accept the Tender of your Person. Admit, my Fair, the Gift invaluable; Yet think, Oh think! thy Osman grants his Allâ Himself, his Love, his Faith, his Constancy; Which by our Prophet, whom I here invoke! Shall never swerve from beauteous Aphendina; But fixt as th'Earth's Poles, remain invariable. Then speak me happyâsay you follow me; Give Osman Life, and bless him with Compliance. APHENDINA. Osman, the Conflict jarring in my Mind, Rends me with Agony ne'er felt before; I see beyond the present pleasing Instant, Bright as the Noon-tide Rayâbut ah! the Clouds Of black Remorse and Infamy o'ercast It's setting DayâOsman consider well E'er you resolve on what I ne'er can grant. OSMAN. Can Aphendina thus protract my Pain! Can she imagine I can live and love, And doat upon those Charms without Fruition? Thou lov'st me not; at least with equal Ardor. You glory in your Emp'ror's Condescension; You set no farther Price on Osman's Love, Than to adorn the Train of your Admirers, Or you'd not thus oppose his Happiness. APHENDINA. Alas! too well you know the Beatings here, Or you'd not thus distress meâOh! Osman, Plungeâbury this in Aphendina's Breast; [Pointing to his Scimitar. But do not kill me with ungentle Terms. It cannot be, but Osman knows I loveâ Nor is't the Emperor, Aphendina covets; But Osmanâfreed from the Impediment, Of lordly Empire, now the only Bar, Betwixt my Wishes and their free Completion. OSMAN. No more reproach me, dearest Aphendina; My fierce Despair converts to burning Rage, Those tender Sentiments, my Heart abounds with, On the least Opposition to my Hopes. O! Aphendina, could you feel my Transport At e'vry yielding Speech, or Glance from you; 'Twould plead my Pardon for a Word misplac'd. But say, thou rigid Fair! my Soul's Delight! Propose some Method to allay my Passion, If you're determin'd never to relent. APHENDINA. And is it Osman who would learn of me; O! spare me on the sad ungrateful Subject; Think not my Love's less ardent than my Lord's: But Laws of State clashing with Virtue's Rules, Leave no Alternative for our Felicity. Let us resolve inviolable Faith; Let us repeat the Resolution daily; Be ever anxious for our mutual Peace; Love each other, forâthat we love, nor Law, Nor Virtue's Cause will then be injur'd; This, this, my Lord's, the Height of my Ambition. OSMAN. Were Virtue's Cause trusted to Thee alone, Bright Seraph! 'twould have many more Admirers; E'en Vice itself would study Condemnation, But to receive its Sentence from thy Lips: You shall hear more, when I've consider'd it. [Exit Osman and enter As ASHAD. Daughter, his Highness left you discontented; His down-cast Look, and Solemness of Pace, Denote an inward Struggle in his Mind: I fear his Power will now command Obedience. APHENDINA. It cannot be, it derogates from Osman; 'Tis too ignoble for his generous Soul: E'en in his brightest Ecstasies of Love, Not the least Syllable has e'er transpir'd Discordant to the purest Virgin's Ear, His ev'ry Act attests the sacred Flame; My Vows accompany himâ [Exit Ashad. Where can th'Excess Of Love 'twixt me and Osman terminate? O! whereâit cannot linger thus for ever. I dread, he'll think it a sufficient Honour For me to wait his Pleasure at the Palace: If I declineâah! may he not compel? Ill fated Maid! how speedy the Transition, From Love to Hate, as varying Passion drivesâ What's the Result then? I'm confin'd, abus'd, Grow wretched, feed on Discontent, and die. If Death then to my Suff'rings must succeed, An icipating Death, avoids my Injuries. Surely 'twere better Choice, than soil my Honourâ I'll ne'er consent, my Virtue is my own; No shall the dazzling Charms of gorgeous Pomp, Have Weight to sink me into pageant Greatness; I'll rise superior to the glitt'ring Toys Of specious Love, and spurn its guilty Joys. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Council Chamber. Sultan, Vizier, Captain Bassa, Kaimacan, Bassa of Bosnia, Aga of the Janizaries, Kisler Aghasi, and others. OSMAN. A matter of Importance pressing me, Wherein I crave your nice Deliberations; I've summon'd you, my Friendsâas Friends indeed, Not as my Ministers, to Call of Office. AttendâThe Question of this Night imports Ourself in Person, and our future Conduct: Let your Advice then be from Reason form'd, As Circumstances shall be laid before ye. Let not your Favour to my private Thoughts, Whate'er they may, or you may judge they be, Have the least Weight upon your Disquisitions, But candidly pronounce from Facts presented, Without Reserve your most impartial Judgments. I shall premise, it is a Case of Love, Originated from my Infancy: The Object, Aphendina, Ashad's Daughter; Our Loves are mutual, Educations one, Ages agreeableâwe think, act, speak, Those Thoughts, Deeds, Notions, one Preceptor taught us: I would enlarge myself to your Apprehensions, To give the ampler Scope for judging truly: We both imbib'd the Principles of Virtue, And have improv'd their Growth by constant Practice; She more refin'dly, living more recluse; Myself with Latitude, engag'd in Wars, And other Occupations of the State. I, as our Laws require, would fain persuade her, To honour my Seraglio with her Presence: She starts, adhering to the Mufti's Precept, âTake no Man but an Husband to thy Bed.â I cannot offer Force to the Deserving. My Question then consists of these four Points; Whether 'tis lawful for your Prince to marry? What Law's against it? When? and why 'twas made? What says our Vizierâ VIZIER. My Opinion, this; That it is lawfulâand in this presume I am not alone. CAPTAIN BASSA. That's my Opinion. KAIMACAN. And mine. AGA. Mineâ OSMAN. Yon Bassa's Look speaks Negative; Give us your Thoughts, Bassaâ BASSA of Bosnia. May't please your Highness; O'er-charg'd with Zeal, and em'lous for your Glory, I singly care t'oppose the current Voice: What! shall we flatter? shall we palliate? Disguise our Sentiments?âOur Prince at stake; My Head shall pay the Forfeit of my Tongue, E'er I submit to join my Emp'ror's Ruin. OSMAN. O'er-charg'd indeed, Bassa! What Head precarious Is held for diff'ring from us in Opinion? Thy Warmth becomes thee not; it speaks Malevolence. BASSA of Bosnia. It speaks the Language of an honest Heartâ Your Highness gave Permission to discuss This Point without Reserve, and weigh it freely. OSMAN. 'Tis true, Bassa, while Reason holds the Beam, Not partial PrejudiceâVizier, proceed. VIZIER. My Lord, perhaps the Bassa reasons thusâ That Laws divine inforce connubial Bonds, But Usage subsequent, confirm'd by Law, Strictly enjoins our Sov'reigns not to wed. BASSA of Bosnia. Shall then our Emperor be circumscrib'd? Abridg'd the Sov'reign's grand Prerogative, That unrestrain'd permits him now to range The Wilds of Beauty, subject to his Pleasure? What! like the Turtle, shall our Empire's Head (Perhaps too issueless) confine his Appetite To one cool, pall'd Repast, the World before him For Propagation of successive Emperors? OSMAN. The Bassa makes the Prince's Will his Guide; If so, the Law conforms but to that Will; Then may not I (my Pleasure coinciding) With equal Liberty decline that Law, As my Progenitors by Choice avow'd it? BASSA of Bosnia. What will the Populace, the Soldiery say? That Osman's noble Nature is subdued By th'Arms inglorious of a trifling Womanâ Assert the Mornarchâforce this techy Bawble To tame Quiescence, at her Emp'ror's Nod. Thisâthis, my Lord, proclaims th'Oth'man Glory. OSMAN. Forbid it, Mahomet! that this were Glory. Like a benighted Traveller thou wander'st, Led by the glimm'ring Meteor of false Fancy, Devious in ErrorâThou mistak'st the Truth, Or speciously deprav'd, confound'st its Essence. Offer no moreâVirtue alone is Glory; Thy Argument retorts upon itself: What! shall the Vulgar Voice controul their Emperor? Then were they Sov'reigns in Will, not I. Vizier, point out the Law against our Marriage. VIZIER. 'Twas made soon after Bajazet's Decease, By Reason of an Insult on his Queen, To prevent future like Indignity. OSMAN. Say, thou Defender of the vulgar Clamour; Say, that I perish in the holy Mosque, Shall no Prince offer there his Pray'rs to Heaven, Because I fell beneath the sacred Dome? Go, preach to Babes, who judge not for themselves; I dare do right, who will opposeâMy Lords! I think, you're clear, by God's Law, all may marry? OMNES. We are, great Sir. OSMAN. Then let his Will be doneâ You tell me, Custom and the old Law forbid. [To the Bassa. BASSA of Bosnia. 'Tis true, my Lord. OSMAN. Who then confirm'd that Law? BASSA of Bosnia. Your Royal Predecessors. OSMAN. Have not I Their Power deriv'd on me, to make, t'abolish? [To the Bassa. Nayâdo not hesitateâbut answer me. BASSA of Bosnia. You have, great Sir. OSMAN. Then what's their Will to me? BASSA of Bosnia. It has been thought to have giv'n our Monarch's Freedom. [Surlily. OSMAN. But may not I abridge myself at Will? Or where's my Freedom?âYet, I'd not be singular, And act against my Predecessors' Rules, Without a PrecedentâLook back; Great Ottoman, (My Family's Founder) Orcan, Amurath, And Bajazet his Successors, were married; The second Amurath, and Solyman, Had both their proper WivesâThen, why not I? Yetâtender in Pursuit of my Devices, (You've heard what has been said) I now enjoin To answerâShall I marry?âShall I not? VIZIER. We're so assur'd, by what our Lord has offer'd; Nought has escap'd his penetrating Eye, That we must wholly acquiesce with him, And gratefully bear of those nice Distinctions, We might have slipt without your Highness Guidance; Nor can your Majesty, in our Opinions, Trace any Steps more worthy Imitation, Than of your fore-nam'd glorious Ancestors. OSMAN. 'Tis wellâthis Secret as a Mark of Confidence I have committed to your Privacy. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Kiosem's Apartments. Kiosem. To her the Bassa of Bosnia. KIOSEM. What News, dear Bassa, from the Sultan's Council? BASSA of Bosnia. Alas! my Princess, all his Ways confound me; Surely his Soul is not of human Temp'rament, Ever aloft above the Reach of Mortals. KIOSEM. Thy tedious Preface racks me with Suspence; Speak, Bassa, speak; give, give me the Result. BASSA of Bosnia. Scorning to lord it over the Female World, His Highness has declar'd a Resolution To constitute his Aphendina Empress. KIOSEM. Confusion! What Opposition met he? BASSA of Bosnia. Myself oppos'd him singly; but his Arguments Rested on Demonstration so convictive, That Malice self-abash'd, blush'd Acquiescence. [Enter an Eunuch of Kiosem, who on Sight of the Bassa seems shy of speaking. KIOSEM. Here's only Friends; dispatch, say what bring'st thou? EUNUCH. The Janizaries so impatient grow, And ripe for Mutiny, they make no Secret Of their Resentment to the Sultan's Measures: They have expell'd their Aga and Lieutenant For their Attachment to his Majesty: They say, from several recent Executions, They're sure his Highness spurs their Leaders on, To less'n their Numbers, by Degrees reduce 'em, And make them useless to the State; nay, farther, Alledge their Corps is not recruited yet, Or like to be, since the late Devastation They suffer'd, in the needless War with Poland. They make some Murm'rings about Arrears, And blame the Sultan's squandering his Cash On gaudy Shews, while they remain unpaid. KIOSEM. My Wish! keep them alarm'd, abet their Courage, And let them know, they want not Friends at Court: [Exit Eunuch. What think'st thou, Bassa? This bespeaks Rebellion! BASSA of Bosnia. I see your Highness tow'ring 'bove your Foes, And wayward Fate lies couchant at your Feet. KIOSEM. Let's lose no Time; Occasion on the Wing Beckons away, to snatch the glorious Prize. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Mufti's Palace. Ashad, musing. ASHAD. The Sultan's Rage will issue forth in Vengeance, If once he breaks the Bands of his Benevolence. He seem'd, methought, cooler than usual, Avoided Interchange of Looks, and turn'd Unwonted from me, as I stept toward him. This Love of his, meeting with Disappointment, Ponders Revenge, and Fury knows no Bounds. I wish his next Rencounter with my Daughter, Don't terminate in some severe Event. I durst not yet inform her of my Fears; She'll not permit me even to suspect him; But Power unlimited is hard to trust, When Youth especially and Love conspire. [Enter Aphendina. APHENDINA. Why hangs this Heaviness upon my Father? You are not us'd to look so cold upon me: You're so reserv'd, you do not smile to Day: Is it ill News? or what you've heard abroad Has caus'd this unaccustom'd Pensiveness? ASHAD. My Child, at present you'd better leave me: Thoughts of your Welfare never quit my Breast; I may clear up again, anon; then leave me. APHENDINA. If they're on my Account, I ought to share them; Let me intreat you, Sir, unfold your Meaning. ASHAD. I know thou'lt be impatient at my Fears. APHENDINA. Indeed I won't, but strive to yield you Comfort. ASHAD. Thou wilt, if they should strike at Osman's Actions. APHENDINA. O! let me hear them; they can't be hurtful, If they treat of Osman. ASHAD. I've only Doubts; They may be vain, my Dear. APHENDINA. And must be so, If you've Doubts of Osman. ASHAD. Howe'er I can't Dismiss them yetâhis Love may ruin thee. APHENDINA. And is that all creates my Father's Grief? His Love's too generous; each Act bespeaks The strictest Honour; too great, too noble For deluding Stratagems. [Enter Servant. SERVANT. My Lord! the Sultan! [Enter Sultan, looking sternly. OSMAN. Madam, you've almost made me desperate; Your Noncompliance with my late Request, Has put me on pursuit of other Measures, In which, I will be trifled with no longer. I've fix'd my Resolution, and demand Your ready Entrance into my Seraglio: My Passion's obstinate; I'll be obey'd. ASHAD. Daughter! where find you now the Man of Honour? APHENDINA. My Lord! I little thought your Love would prompt you, To this ungen'rous Treatment of your Slave. My Duty binds me to obey your Orders, And I'll attend your Call; but know, my Lord, The Bars of the Seraglio are too weak, Long to retain a Soul designed for Paradise; Your Love, I see, aims only at my Person, My inward Mind, my Virtue's Excellence, Weigh little in the Ballance of your Hope, So both deserted fall to my Disposal; I want not Means, my Lord, to die unspotted. [Weeping. OSMAN. O! no; die all the World but Aphendina: [Embracing. Thou shalt indeed be borne to the Seraglio, Not as a Slave, but as thy Osman's Bride: Thou shalt in equal Share partake my Glory. And you, my Father! as I ever call'd you, Henceforth art so, upon a double Claim Be happy then, Old Man, as we can make you; Behold in us your Sultan and your Empress; Be third in our Dominionsâwhy not chief? He by whose Hand the Blessing is conferr'd, Should rank in Excellence, beyond the Blest. APHENDINA. Sir, do I dream! I'm too amaz'd to thank you! This Mark of Favour and Benevolence, Would seem Delusion from another Man; But Osman's Tongue can't falsify his Heart. O! think not, Sir, my Stop to your Desires, Proceeded from a Prospect of this Issue; Nought so remote from probable, hath ever Painted a faint Idea in my Mind, Of any Blessing to compare with this: This could be only gender'd in your Breast; No other Soul capacious to admit it OSMAN. Fair Excellence! thy Beauties struck my Heart, Thy Virtues gain'd Dominion o'er my Soul; Thank not your Osman for the happy Moment; 'Tis your Perfections Dueâunequal Tribute! It were unjust to make no Difference, Betwixt Divinity, and earthly Objects. Madam, my Orders wait you at the Palace, [Takes her Hand. Reception meets you as befits our Queen; To-morrow's Sun shall hail our Titles equal. [Exeunt omnes. SCENE IV. Vizier, Master of the Works, and Secretary. VIZIER. Is all prepar'd according to my Plan, To grace my Royal Master's Nuptials? MASTER. My Lord, the Shortness of the Time prevented; Some slight Embellishment might have been added, But nought can equal in Magnificence The whole Design, most exquisitely form'd. [Exit. VIZIER. Have all the Heralds had their full Instructions? [To the Secretary. Are proper Orders sent the Military? Let all the Officers of the Seraglio Attend their Posts upon the Trumpet's Sound; Those of the Cavalcade must move betimes; The whole Procession ends with Half the Day: Beware, let nothing wait. SECRETARY. I will, my Lord. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Apartment in the Palace. Mirza and Kiosem, meeting. KIOSEM. I joy to see your Highnessâmore to see Your Looks are alter'd, since our former Meeting; Those Charms preserv'd, may cause a Doubt in Osman, And bring him back repentant to your Arms. MIRZA. My Beauty, Madam, was it tenfold more, Could have no Force without an Eye to view it. KIOSEM. The Sultan has been with you since we met. MIRZA. Not once so much as thought of me, I fear. KIOSEM. Ungrateful, barb'rous Prince! to use you thus; Surely these Men think Women have no Passions, Or can subdue them with a Nod of theirs: My good Lord Achmet, the young Osman's Father, Tho' he lov'd roving, never shook me off, But trusted me with all his new Amours; And in Return, I favour'd his Designs, Always contributed to his Delights; However, with this Caution, still to keep Myself the sov'reign Partner of his Bed: Thus, while he reign'd, I held the Royal Sway; But had his Majesty abandon'd me, His Crown had sat precarious on his Head. MIRZA. By Mahomet! thou'st rous'd my tardy Soul; The ebbing Tide of lull'd Ambition, Flows thro' each Vein, and swells me into Action. KIOSEM. Was I Sultana Queen, I'd scorn to stoop; Disdain t'accept the Refuse of his Loveâ I have not seen this new engaging Creature; This Aphendinaâbutâ MIRZA. O! name her not, Unless thou mean'st to agitate my Fears, With wild Variety of distracting Fancies. KIOSEM. 'Tis said, a pompous Embassy attended, To introduce her to her Father's Tent; Where she and Osman spent whole Hours together. MIRZA. Furies and Hell! why would'st thou rack me thus? KIOSEM. Nay, sent her home guarded with equal Splendor. Th'imperious Thing! I'm told, in wanton Merriment, Droll'd on the Prince's Death, and vaunting boasted Osman her ownâRegardless too of Mirza, He join'd the Laugh, and with a fleering Smile Approv'd her Raillery. MIRZA. Ten thousand Curses! Am I then fall'n thus low, to be their Mirth? By all my Injuries, I swear Revenge: Hence to the Winds each tender Sympathy; O! for the savage Fierceness of the Lynx, That I might hurl my Vengeance on their Heads, Sport with their Anguish, and enjoy their Ruin. KIOSEM. Mirza is now herself, again the Queen; This glorious Spirit may surmount your Wrongs, And foil your EnemiesâMay Heaven direct you. [Exit Kiosem. MIRZA sola. Curse on my FateâWas e'er such Wretchedness! Sequester'd from a Throne, from Osman's Love; O! that I had never reach'd the Height of Majesty! Never been blest within my Osman's Armsâ What! be the Jest of that insulting Minxâ Hold! hold my Brain! there's Frenzy in the Thought! Distraction aid me!âO! that I could not thinkâ Perdition seize the Globe and Aphendinaâ Chaos and endless Night resume your Reign! Envellope all! I'm weary of the Lightâ [Enter Aphendina. Mirza starts. What Fiend has sent her to oppose my Way? Madam, your Arts prevail; nay, smile, exult And triumph i'th'inglorious Spoil you've made. APHENDINA. Heav'n only knowsâ MIRZA. Dar'st thou to talk of Heaven! Thy sully'd Soul bears no Affinity To its pure native white; thou'rt black as Hell; Thou kill'st my Sight, art more distasteful to it Than the dun Toad bloated with Pride, as thou art. Curse on thy Artificeâdissembling Wretch! APHENDINA. Madam, composeâ MIRZA. Bid the loud Tempest cease When the fierce North is rous'd! Think'st thou to calm My Passion's Hurricane, by pedant Preachments Of Composure!âin vain, proud Minx! in vain; Hast thou not robb'd me of my Osman's Love? What do'st thou meanly think my Spirit's form'd Of that coarse Refuse, sordid as thine own? That I've so little of the Woman in me, As to sit loose to all the Pomp of Life; To part with Sov'reignty without a Struggle, And tamely wear your lavish Insolence? No, by our Prophet! my Revenge shall crush you. [Aphendina weeps. Weep, till your Heart-strings crack; it joys me much T'indulge me o'er thy TearsâAway to Osman, He'll listen to thy Whine; at ev'ry Pause Will sigh, I loveâBelieve the Hypocrite, And be as curst as the forsaken Mirza. APHENDINA. Think not these Tears self-interested flow; They owe their Current to a nobler Source, Pure as my Heart. MIRZA. Thy Heart! 'tis scribbl'd o'er; The Character of Truth is no where legible, One Mass of foul Dishonour! 'way Dissembler. APHENDINA. I cannot leave you thus distrestâMy Queen! Permit me share your Grief; I cannot bear To see such Excellence so greatly mov'd. Thus let me bend to beg your patient Ear; [Going to kneel. âIf e'er Ambition swell'd my humble Breast, If e'er Desire revell'd in my Mind Incontinentâlet Mirza then despise me. âBut OsmanâIf thou'st felt what 'tis to love, And be belov'd by Osman, thou'lt forgive me. MIRZA. O Aphendina! well I know his Power. [Pausing. Yesâhe would charm a Syren with his Tongueâ Whene'er he speaks, the Accents softer flow, Than the Lute's gentlest Trill; but when he'd wooe, The Turtle's plaintive Notes are harsh to his. O! were he but as trueâSuch Dignity, Such Grace 'waits each ActâI must forgive thee, If thou lov'st my Osman. [Enter Osman hastily, running to embrace Aphendina; Mirza unperceiv'd. OSMAN. My Life! my All! Thus let me clasp thee to my glowing Breast, And gaze for ever on thy rising Beauties. Sure Nature triumph'd when she form'd Perfection, And nam'd the lovely Model Aphendina: The smiling Love's i'th'Dimples of thy Cheek, Hold here their Fairy Court; unbounded Joy, [Looking on her. In mystic Dance, revels within these Eyes. MIRZA. O! that deluding Tongue. OSMAN. Ha! Mirza here! [Turning. MIRZA. Yes, Osman, Mirza's here; your once lov'd Mirza. Such was the Language won my foolish Heart; Then you would kneel, implore, nay, sigh and swear, That Mirza's Beauty triumph'd o'er the Sex: But thou art false. OSMAN. Thou wrong'st me, I am just; 'Twas my Opinion then. MIRZA. Think'st thou by Casuistry, And Subterfuges mean, t'elude me still? Perfidious Man!âHas my Affection fail'd? OSMAN. Madam, Obedience to our Will best speaks Affection to our PersonâRetireâno more. MIRZA. So lordly! Yes, Imperious! I will be gone; My tow'ring Soul shall ne'er descend so low, To crave thy Love, to beg it as a Favour: Hence with the slavish Coz'nageâThank thee, Osman! Thou'st freed me of my Chains; a nobler Passion Reanimates my Breast, more worthy Mirza; Revenge, Revenge shall right her Injuries. [Ex. Mirza. OSMAN. Mirza so warm! by Mahomet! I am mov'dâ [Pauses. But when I gaze on thee, illustrious Maid! My ruffled Bosom's hush'd, the Storm's no more: But say! my Aphendina! why this Change? Why are the glowing Beauties of thy Face, (The Seat of endless Joy) thus clouded o'er? Whilst thy fond Osman's Heart beats high with Rapture, O'erflows with Transport, and is lost in Ecstasy. APHENDINA. Forgive me, Osman, that I thus offend; Ne'er till this Instant did my constant Heart Know what it was, not to be wholly your's: Now, as two meeting Streams by Force repellent, Stagnate each other in their wonted Course; So Love and Pity in my Breast at Variance, Sway my divided Soul, dispute the Passage, Nor leave a Current for each other's Flow. O! OsmanâI cannotâbut feel for Mirza. OSMAN. By Heav'n! this Softness gains upon my Soul, Beyond the boist'rous Air, the big-swoln Pride Of haughty Beauty on its Charms presuming: There was no Need of this, my Aphendina, T'insure a Conquest over Osman's Heart. I pity her, but Virtue has its Bounds; Excess is faulty, we must sometimes wave Too rigid RightâOsman, when blest with thee, His utmost Wish replete, shall then expatiate, Look round the various Globe, pursue each Plan Where Glory points the Way, and bless Mankind. APHENDINA. Osman! thy Words steal gently on my Senses, And bear me smoothly down th'inchanting Stream Of soft PersuasionâWe're prepar'd to admit Whate'er our Wishes prompt us to believe. OSMAN. Clear up my Fair! and give a Loose to Joy; Rival the Glories of the Delian God, When in his Chariot flaming thro' the East, He dissipates the Gloom, and brightens Day: Let then that Radiance beaming thro' those Eyes, Shed kinder Influence, dispel each Cloud. Let not my Empress' Bosom chill with Fear, But glow with Prospect of our future Joys: Anxiety and Care shall stand aloof, In Wonder wrapt pay Homage to these Charms, Nor dare t'intrude, where Love, and Peace, and Joy, Triumph enthron'd on Aphendina's Breast. [Exeunt. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Palace. Sultan, Aphendina, Vizier, Mufti, Bassas, Beglerbegs, and Soldiers, all as in Procession from the Marriage: The Sultan and Aphendina ascend the Throne, the rest range themselves. OSMAN. This Day be sacred in our Turkish Annals, Which makes the peerless Aphendina mine. O! that the World were all at my Dispose, To make the nobler Off'ring to my Love! The whole Sex's Worth is Aphendina's Dower, Which throws at Distance Osman's best Returns. APHENDINA. You rate, most mighty Lord! my mean Perfections At too great Price; I fear my future Merit, At best, should sink beneath your Highness's Standard. Next to being perfect, is to aim to be so; Which lying within my Pow'r, shall not be wanting. ASHAD. Most mighty Lord! accept my Gratitude, For this excessive Honour done my Daughter, And me in herâMy Duty's to exhort you, To be attentive to your proper Glory; Let not th'Affection which you bear your Bride, Bias your Justice, or your Clemency, But let your Love for Virtue still preside. âAnd you, my Daughter late, but now my Empress, Maintain by Virtue, what Virtue has atchiev'd; Give faithful Council, be affectionate; In Duty as in Rank, excel all others; Nor influence your Lord to aught unjust: Long may ye both enjoy a prosp'rous Reign. VIZIER. Invincible Emperor! most mighty Osman! Permit your Slave, i'th'Name of all the States, Beglerbegs, Bassas, and the many Millions Of humblest Servants to our Royal Master, To testify their Joy at this Solemnity. âWhat Blessings may we not assure ourselves, Will issue from a Conduct so refin'd! Our former Emp'rors, despotick Ravagers! Preying on Beauty with resistless Will, Have glory'd in a Latitude of Action; While you, great Sir! their Junior far in Years, Descending from the Monarch to the Man, Have taken to your Arms one beauteous Bride, Relinquishing the Sex for her alone: May your Descendants multiply to Thousands! Truly inheriting your Qualities; And may the Ott'man State ne'er want a Prince, Of your illustrious Line to grace the Throne. OSMAN. Next to my Joys conceiv'd for Aphendina, Your warm Affection fills my royal Breast. I chose to solemnize these Rites in publick, To shew, that I contemn not Laws in general, But those which have not Reason for their Basis, And that I mean to square my future Actions By that equal RuleâThis ye shall not fail To find in Osman, while he sways the Sceptre. Princes should act as gracious Heav'n design'd, And deal out Happiness to all Mankind; Born for the Publick Weal, their Aim should be, To constitute their Subjects great and free. [Ex. SCENE II. Sultana Queen's Apartments. Mirza and two Odalisks. MIRZA. You urge in vain, Osman is not to blame; A softer Creature Nature never form'd: What tho' my Woes sit heavily upon me, Can she prevent them? it was Osman's Will: She prides not over me, but sooths my Grief With ev'ry friendly Art, which not prevailing, Commixes Tears with mine in mere Compassion. First ODALISK. A very Crocodile! fie on your Weakness: No doubt, she laughs in private at your Woe; Sly, crafty Authoress of your Undoing; Quit her, and follow Kiosem's Advice. MIRZA. I cannot contradict my Sense so grosly: In plain, I love her; nay, I could adore her; But Osman interposes to my Mindâ O Love! O Friendship! cruelâtender Names! Whence have you Pow'r to rack the human Frame, And torture't thus with agonizing Pain! AngerâRevengeâthose Monsters of the Mind, Are petty Tyrants, when compar'd with you. Unhappy Mirza! can't forget her Osman, Nor hate her Rival, tho' they have undone her. [Exit Mirza. Second ODALISK. Her Prejudice is fix'd beyond Remove; How shall we mention it to Kiosem? First ODALISK. She's never at a Loss, or wants a Means To bring about the most amazing Things; We must inform her of it, or we're undone. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Empress's Apartment. APHENDINA sola. The Sultan bears a Weight upon his Brow, Sure nought in me can give Occasion for it: O! that I could enucleate and descend Into the close Recesses of his Soul! Bear all his Cares and his Inquietudes. I must be satisfied, I'm not the Cause Of this Dejection, that would rive my Heart; I will attempt it, soon as he returns; But, here he comes, pray Heav'n I don't offend him. [Enter Sultan. Most mighty Lord! I crave an humble Boon, But let it please your Highness, that I ask. OSMAN. When Aphendina sues, the Boon's inverted; She cannot ask too much, nor Osman grant. APHENDINA. Osman, you know I love; then with what Hope, Can I behold your Highness sigh before me; Look heavily, and muse, and sigh again? Is it, my Osman, that youv'e made me Empress? Is it that you've confin'd yourself to me? Is it from any Cause I can redress? Command me Osman, to Life's utmost Verge, I'll acquiesce; but let not Osman sigh, I cannot bear it, till I know the Cause: Oh! racking Thought! Osman may sigh at me. OSMAN. No, Aphendina, thy superior Merit Hourly renews thy faithful Osman's Love: Rest satisfy'd, my Dear, 'tis not at Thee, Thy Osman sighs, nor suits it that ye know, Till met in Council, I reveal my Mind: Chear up my Queen, cast off this mournful Guise, Be ever joyous in your Osman's Presence: You shall to Council with me, there the Cause. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Scene opens and discovers the Council. Enter Osman and Aphendina to them, and seat themselves. OSMAN. My Lords! a critical Affair of State, Demands in Council your united Voices: My Janizaries are a restless Corps, Strongly addicted to rebellious Principles; Full prone to Mutiny; soon roused to Action; Expressive Tokens of a Set of Cowards, And they behaved as such i'th'Polish War. Their Tongues licentious, with Invectives fraught, Against my Throne and Ministry dispence, Their venom'd Treasons publickly abroad. âPernicious Donatives on each new Reign, Make Changes acceptable: These by Design Defenders of the State; Destroyers rather! On ev'ry Sultan's Death turn Plunderers, Spoil the Imperial City, and escape, By joyning to proclaim the Successor; In Brief, no Law can curb their Villainies, Nor's any Crime too gross for their Commission. These Motives urge me to dissolve their Order; Unwilling in a Matter so momentous, Rashly, to act without your sage Advice: My Queen! what say you? let me have your Thoughts. APHENDINA. I would reserve myself for after hearing. VIZIER. Most gracious Sov'reign! all you've urg'd is just; But Dangers insurmountable attend it: The Soldiers know their Pow'r, will abuse it On the most slight Suggestions to their Damage; Unless th'Imperial City was remov'd, Grand Cairo or Damascus claim Preheminence, (If so resolv'd) before all other Cities; In one of these, your Highness might at Pleasure, Exterminate these Enemies of Princes; The People's Voice, would second the Transaction, Who hate the Janizaries as their Foes. OSMAN. T'is well, we've had your Sentiments, retire; This Thought will do, 'tis worthy of my Vizier. [Exit all but Sultan and Aphendina, who rise. APHENDINA. My Lord! I think with Horror to reflect, On the Resolve your Highness is pursuing: Are not the Soldiers Masters of the City? Have they not ris'n against their own Commanders? Expell'd 'em hence, and like an headless Corps, Are ripe for ev'ry mischievous Impression. Then suffer me t'intreat your Majesty, Make sure the Janizaries, cajole that Corps, Never engage with them in open Rupture: I tremble but to think, this Day's Debate Should reach their Ears; for good, my Lord, what is there You've not to fear, from their rude Insolence? Your Crown, your Life itself, may fall before 'em, And Death alone bring Ease to Aphendina. OSMAN. Fear not, my lovely Spouse! I have a Project Ris'n in my Breast, shall baffle ev'ry Danger: âA Pilgrimage to Mecca will secure us, And closely cover my design'd Retreat: Yes, that shall do, and instant Preparations Shall be commenc'd to prosecute my Will. [Re-enter Vizier. Vizier! I'm fixt upon a Tour to Mecca; Dispatch my Equipage; my Uncle Mustapha, And all my Brothers, shall attend me thither: Give necessary Orders to the Court. VIZIER. I will, my Lord. OSMAN. Thus far for publick Notice; a Word privatelyâ [Taking him aside. Give Orders for twelve Gallies to be fitted, Ship all my Treasure and rich Furniture; Make known, I take them with me to prepare, A nobler Off'ring at the Prophet's Shrine; When all is ready, I'm prepar'd to move: Then privately send Notice to Grand Cairo, For all the Asiatic Troops to meet me: Commit it to a trusty A Courier. Ichoglan, With instant Orders to pursue his Journey: Attend on me again, when this is done. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Kiosem's Apartments. Kiosem and Phesalie. KIOSEM. Lost and undone! This sudden Resolution Distracts my Brain; Ideas rise so fast, They jostle out each other from my Mind; E're I conclude on which to fix my Hopes, My wonted Spirits revert upon my Sense, And dam it upâI've no Expedient left T'extricate myself, or save my Amurath. PHESALIE. Madam, this ill-tim'd Passion stifles Thought, Nor leaves a Scope for calm Deliberation: Why should you judge your Children less secure, Among some Thousand Forces to attend them, Than now confined under the A chief Officer in the Seraglio. Aghasi? One Person's Will may sooner be corrupted, At least commanded, than a Multitude's. KIOSEM. O! no; their Uncle Mustapha, and they, Are led to Slaughter in the dreary Desart; Where one by one, neglected, they'll be lost, And all at last seem but the Work of Nature: Osman's Immensity of Craft confounds me, Checks my Pursuits, and frustrates all my Measures: But Med'cine is extracted from the Aspâ This Over-reach shall farther my Designs. [Enter two of Kiosem's Eunuchs. O! happy Menâso opportunely sent, To serve your Mistress in Extremity. Be instant at the Janizaries' Chamber; Tell 'em, his Highness purposes for Mecca; That they are to conduct him thro' the Desarts, Where h'as appointed Troops of Arabians, From Ambuscade, t'attack 'em unprepar'd; Dispatch 'em, and succeed to their Employ: Bid 'em advance to stop the Sultan's Journey, By ev'ry Means, or they come too lateâ Tell 'em, three Suns appearing at Midday, Prognosticate great Changes in the State, For them reserv'd; that Prodigies from Heaven Ought not to be neglected; but that they, Whose Pow'r extends to the deposing Sov'reigns, Should act conformable to Heav'n's Decrees. [Exeunt Eunuchs. â'Tis well, my Mind grows calmer; I'll to Court, And strive to gain farther Intelligence. [Exit. SCENE VI. A Council of Janizaries. First JANIZARY. Shall we sit tamely, 'till our Throats are cut? Our Order stript of all its antient Ensigns; Cashier'd, and render'd useless to the State? Let us recal our glorious Predecessors To mind, reflect on their illustrious Actions, Make them our Precedent, who bravely struggled Thro' Seas of Blood to raise themselves a Name. Second JANIZARY. Unking'd the boldest; rais'd to Dignity Those, in their Judgments, were the most deserving; But never suffer'd Insults 'gainst themselves. Third JANIZARY. What plainer Indication of base Views, Than this pretended Pilgrimage to Mecca? Fourth JANIZARY. I am inform'd, and that from no mean Hand, Destruction waits us in th'Arabian Desarts: The Manner is concerted, and the Authors. Fifth JANIZARY. And we like Sheep before the Butcher's Cur, Are to be drove, incautious to the Slaughter. No! by the Head of Mahomet I swear, Tho' all my Brethren's Courage fail, mine shall not. First JANIZARY. What boots it wasting Breath in Conference? Our Overthrow's determin'dâ Second JANIZARY. Words lose but Time; Prepare we for Defenceâ Third JANIZARY. Demand the Vizier's, And Preceptor's Headsâ Fourth JANIZARY. A Stop immediate To th'intended Journey, and strict Indempnity For our Proceedings. OMNES. Agreed, agreed, agreed. First JANIZARY. Prepare, and rendezvous in Half an Hour. [Exeunt. SCENE VII. The Empress's Lodgings. Aphendina and Ashad. APHENDINA. I dread, my Father! Osman's Violence Will hurry down Destruction on our Heads; One general Murmur fills th'Imperial City: The Janizaries, rank for Mutiny, Wait but a Spark to set them in a Blaze: What the Result of that will be, Heav'n knows! ASHAD. The melancholy Prospect gives me Pain: I've made Remonstrances, but his great Heart, Unshaken in Misfortune, as Tranquility, Imputes it all to Tim'rousness in meâ âWhat! shall a Servant dare control his Lord?â He criesââI'll frown them to Obedience.â 'Twere pity, as to him, intrepid Courage So close accompanies consummate Virtue. Good Qualities are dauntless; Principles Not self-condemning, dread no other Censure. If any thing unbends his Resolution, It must be you, my Daughter! Urge your Fears, Intreat him for the Love of you, his Glory, But to relax the Rigour of his Purpose, And wait a more propitious Opportunity. APHENDINA. None of these Motives have escap'd my Pray'rs; He grants me hearing with the mildest Temper, Embraces me, and says, âI am a Woman:â I can no more; some abler Hand than mine Must paint our Miseries in blacker Colours. The Vizier and Effendi, both against it, Will join their Voices to enforce your Reasons; I shall be glad to hear that you prevail. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. Sultan and Vizier. OSMAN. How have the Imams sped among the Troops? Have they submitted to our Obedience? VIZIER. They're not return'd as yet, great SirâMy Lord! Might your Slave venture to propose his Thoughts, Your Highness should postpone this Enterprize; Such Opposition rises from each Quarter, I wish my Suffering may save my Lord; I hear they loudly clamour for my Head. OSMAN. Believe me, Vizier, they'll have mine as soon. [Enter Ashad. Kneels. ASHAD. My Lord, my Duty casts me at your Feet; Mov'd by Affection, as your Priest and Father, T'implore Compassion, for myself, your Spouse, Your Empire, Friends, and this Imperial City; Blame not, great Sir, this humble Testimony, Of my sincere Attachment to your Highness: You see not with my Eyes, the mad Contagion Spreading thro' every Member of the Janizars; That turb'lent Corps conceal their Rage no longer, Are now preparing to obtain by Force, What their sound Reasonings (they say) can't gain; The The Turkish Marine. Levantines deserting their Commanders, Join'd to the Soldiers, make their Numbers dreadful: For Heaven's sake, my Lord, appease their Fury, E're they proceed too far, to sound Retreat. [Enter two Cadileskiers, presenting a Paper. OSMAN. How durst you venture to approach our Presence Uncall'd for? CADILESKIERS. Mighty Lord, we were compell'd. OSMAN. Was ever daring Insolence like this! [Reads. What! am I menac'd here with Fire and Sword, For following the Dictates of my Will, My Reason rather? Tell th'audacious Rabble, I am their Emperor, and will be obey'd. [Exeunt Cadileskiers, and enter Aphendina. APHENDINA. Most gracious Lord, my Emp'ror, my Husband! By all the sacred Ties of human Nature! Your Dignity, your Empire, and your Love, Take Pity on a poor distracted Woman, Whose Grief's too pungent for Alleviation, But from a gentle Answer of your Highness. The rapid Torrent of curst Disaffection, Not to your Highness's Person, but Designs, Drives on the Soldiers with resistless Motion, To sacrifice (as they proclaim) th'Advisers Of your pernicious Schemes against the Empire. O! let Compassion reach your gen'rous Heart, And melt it into Mercy for the Opprest; Your Wife the chief, your dearest Aphendina; My Father, my Lord Vizier, and the many, Your faithful Friends, who'd rather die than leave you. My dearest Lord, consider what y'oppose, Licentious Rabble, excited by their Fears And Jealousies, to murder and destroy. The good, the bad, the great, the infamous, Meet equal Fate in gen'ral Massacres; But those, whose Pow'r may call 'em to Account, Are sure to feel the Weight of their Resentment: One Word from you, my Lord, may stop the Rise, When your Life only may retard their Progress. OSMAN. You, pow'rful Advocate! can't plead in vain; Rise and embrace me, dearest Aphendina; You have your Wish; tell 'em, I will not leave 'em: And you, fair Princess, set your Heart at Rest, And follow me. APHENDINA. With right good Will, my Lord. [Exeunt. SCENE IX. The Janizaries in confus'd March. [Enter a Messenger from the Sultan. MESSENGER. Commend me to the Aga of your Order, I have a Message from the Emperor. First JANIZARY. We have no Aga; what's your Bus'ness with him? MESSENGER. Then my Commands are to you all. I'm t'informâ OMNES. Hear him, hear himâSilence! begin, begin. MESSENGER. I'm t'inform ye, 'tis his Highness's Will, Finding his Journey gave Dissatisfaction, To all his loving Soldiers, and his Subjects, At their Request, quite to relinquish it: For as he strives in ev'ry other Action, To do his Subjects pleasure; so in this. JANIZARIES Omnes. Allah, Allah, Osman, Osman, Allah; Long live our noble gen'rous Emp'ror Osman! [Exit Messenger, and enter Levantines with an Ichoglan. First LEVANTINE. Along, along with him; bring him along: We met this Fellow loit'ring on the Shore; And having seiz'd him, found a trait'rous Letter, Which speaks its own Contents, better than we can. [A Janizary reads. To the Bassa of Grand Cairo. âWe have for many Reasons resolv'd to transfer our Seat of Empire to our antient City of Grand Cairo, whither we are about to transmit our own Treasure with those of our Fathers. We command you, therefore, at Sight hereof, to set forwards, to meet us, with all the Forces of our Kingdom of Egypt.â Osman. Second JANIZARY. O! VillainyâO! Mahomet! this is the Journey. You've heard the Letter, and mark'd the Contents: What say you t'it? OMNES. Let's chuse a Head, and march. Third JANIZARY. Shall Aly Aga be your new Commander? OMNES. He shall, he shall; Aly Aga, he shall. Fourth JANIZARY. First let us find the Mufti, and compel him To march before us to the Seraglio. OMNES. Agreed, agreed; march, Aly Aga, march. [Exeunt. SCENE X. The Court before the Seraglio. Osman, Vizier, Aphendina, Ussain, talking at an open Window. Enter Janizaries, calling aloud for the Vizier and Treasurer. OSMAN. Ho! what's the Meaning of this Insolence? [From the Window. ALY AGA. Send us the Head of Dilaver Vizier, OSMAN. Your Arrogance will claim the Sultan's next. ALY. Descend, and answer for our Injuries. OSMAN. Arm, arm, my Friends; I'll make a Sally on 'em: Their Menaces are worse to me than Death. APHENDINA. My Lord! my Lord! expose not that dear Life, They may be pacify'd; be calm, my Osman; The Uproar is so loud, they cannot hear you: Sign but a Writing with your Hand, my Lord, Assuring them the Journey's laid aside, And of your friendly Disposition to 'em, They'll be entreated, and return to Duty. OSMAN. My dearest Princess! I had sooner died, [Writes and throws it. Than any other had extorted this. I know their Perfidy, this won't content 'em, This Shew of Fear, but heightens their Demand. VIZIER. Great Sir! the Hazard of your sacred Person, May be prevented by exposing mine; I cannot wish to die a nobler Victim: These dang'rous Tumults scarce subside again, But by the Sacrifice of a Vizier. Then what am I, to have a Wish for Safety? OSMAN. Thou art a worthy Man, nor fear'st to die. [Embracing. Myself am honestâand I fear as little: A gallant Man disdains to die by Proxy; No, if their Aim is Blood, let it be mine. VIZIER. At least deposing me, make Ussain Vizier; Let him descend, and try his Art to gain 'em. OSMAN. If this you would advise me, be it so. USSAIN. I shall not dread t'expose my Life to serve you. [Ussain descends. Most noble Aly! deign to hear my Message; His Highness has depos'd Dilaver Vizier; The Seal's committed to my Care: Your Injuries In open Conference shall be discuss'd. [Enter Kiosem's two Eunuchs. Choose of your Chiefs, twelve Deputies To-morrowâ Charg'd with DemandsâMyself will give them Audience, And settle all Things to our mut'al Interests. ALY. What we demand, my Lord, is antient Freedom, A due Regard t'our venerable Order, And that his Highness will forego his Journey. USSAIN. Aly! We shan't be long adjusting this; It is his Highness's Pleasure so to be. ALY. Then we'll withdraw, and nominate our Proxies. [Kiosem's Eunuchs to the Janizaries, aside. First EUNUCH. What! will your Leader leave you in the Toil? SECOND. Is it for this your Force hath been collected? FIRST. Can any Man believe but you're undone? SECOND. They wait but Time to bring th'Arabians on you, And other African and Asian Troops. FIRST. You can't conceive, their Hearts inclin'd to Peace. SECOND. You shall be seconded by noble Hands. FIRST. Depose this Osman, this projecting Sultan; We've Blood enough, as yet, of Ottoman. SECOND. To indicate this is the Sense above; Here, take these Gifts, in Token of their Favour, [Distributes Money. It shall be Ten-fold, when the Work is done. ALY. File offâa Treaty is agreed upon. [Janizaries Cabal. First JANIZARY. With whom? SECOND. For what? THIRD. We choose you not our Judge, But temporary Leader.â FOURTH. We'll retire. When what conven'd us here, is executed. [Break in. FIRST. Here's the Disturber of the Empire's Peace. SECOND. We'll have his Head. [Find Dilaver, and kill him. THIRD. This is another of 'em. [Kill Kisler Aga. FOURTH. Destroy 'em all, let not a Man escape. FIFTH. March with their Heads in Triumph to our Friends; The Night approaching, let's return To-morrow. SIXTH. Now, Aly, lead us off, we'll follow you, And place young Amurath upon the Throne. ALY. He that commands a Multitude's their Tool, And must be subject, if he means to rule. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Aly writing; to him Ussain Vizier. ALY. My good Lord Ussain! what has drawn you forth, Before the Dawn of Day? USSAIN. The Hope of finding Aly, unbent from other publick Cares, And ready to admit my Conference: I choose to settle the Preliminaries With you, before the Deputies' Arrival: It may both quicken and facilitate The Terms and Method of Accommodation. [Enter Servant. SERVANT. My Lord! two Strangers beg Admittance to you. ALY. What Characters bear they? SERVANT. The one's a Spahi, The other seems a Person of Distinction. ALY. Usher 'em inâLord Vizier, you'll excuse [Exit Servant. My introducing Strangers to your Presence. [Enter Sultan dressed like a Spahi, and Ussain; Sultan looks stern without speaking. My Lord! my Sovereign! my Emperor! [Starts. OSMAN. How comes it, Aly, you should pay Respect To Majesty depos'd, under Disguise; Yet rise in Arms against me on the Throne? What Tyranny, what Injustice have I done, That should exact such heinous Treatment from you? 'Tis true, I purpos'd to withdraw myself From factious Insolence and mad Caprice: Err'd I in this? Am I not justified In my form'd Conduct, from the present Outrage? âThis, notwithstanding, willing to content you, I acquiesc'd to pretermit my Journey, Waiting Submission for my Condescension: But, to return my Favour, you've destroy'd The Man I chiefly valuedâDilaver: And is it Aly? is it that same Aly, On whose Fidelity ('till now untainted) I would have plac'd the Safety of my Head, Who leads these miscreant Wretches to dethrone me? See, Aly, thenâthat Osman you abhor, Avoiding Death by a less noble Hand, Unfolds his Bosom to receive the Stroke; Strike, Aly, strike; your Emp'ror bids you strike. ALY. Alas, my Lord! yourself has giv'n a Wound, [Kneeling. More pungent to my Soul, than bitt'rest Death: Thou Sun! great Minister of Light! no more Display thy Beams, retract thy Influence; My glaring Villainy obscures thy Presence; I am not worthy to behold my Emperor, Yet cannot die 'till after Expiation, By sacrificing all in his Defence. OSMAN. Rise, live, be faithful; may your Repentance Be equally sincere with my Forgiveness; Time's short, make such Proposals to the Rebels As I may offer, and they best receive; Myself will here attend the Issue on't. [Exeunt. OSMAN solus. What dire Events are incident to Royalty, From those Props destin'd to sustain its Being! âIn what few Hands the Empire of the World! How many Millions subject to one Man! Yet all are govern'd by their several Interests: From whence this Servitude, but from our Interests? The Prince, Dispenser of all earthly Favours, Makes Distribution to some chosen Minions; All others lean on them for a Support, In just Progression to the meanest Slave: Those, to preserve themselves, maintain his Rights; These, for Protection, follow their Example: Those Numbers, whom one Interest conjoins, Are only terrible to sov'reign Power, And may alone be justly stil'd that Power: This the Condition of my Janizaries; Their Interests so united in each Member, No Part can suffer, but the Body feels it, And Feeling will resent, while Force remains: My Predecessors, hurry'd by their Passions, Deserting Reason's Guide, oppress'd Mankind; Men injur'd, will resist: Those form a Power Sufficient to maintain their lawless Rule; Little considering, that very Strength Bears equal Enmity against themselves, (With those they're bought to curb) upon Occasion, Or truly given, or at least presum'd. âI've press'd too hard upon my Janizaries; One Chain of Nature holds thro' all Mankind; And not to act like Men, were to be more: Fear, join'd to Hate, bears down all Opposition; Then, lest they fall, they'll think it meet that I should. [Enter Hussan. HUSSAN. Fly! fly, my Lord! I have not Time t'inform! The cursed Actions of the wicked Janizaries: O! fly, my Lord! OSMAN. Hussan, I will not stir, 'Till I've the Cause. HUSSAN. My Lord, the Vizier open'd your Instructions, With all Benevolence amongst the Troops; Aly then back'd it with your Royal Word, And had proceeded, but their instant Fury Hack'd him to Piecesâtook the Vizier's Head, And ecchoing dreadful Shouts of Amurath, Are hither on their March, to seize your Highnessâ [Noise without. Fly! fly, my Lord! they're hereâ OSMAN. I'll meet my Fate Undaunted; conscious Honour be my Guard: Let them come onâ [The Janizaries force in and kill Hussan. HUSSAN. O! spare his Majestyâ [The Janizaries at a Stand. OSMAN. Why stand ye trembling thus? Behold your Lord! 'Tis Osman speaks; for Shame, lay down your Armsâ What! Thousands to a single Man? [Janizaries rushing on him, he resists and kills some. First JANIZARY. Don't hear him. SECOND. Secure our Enemyâ THIRD. Bring the Projector To publick Shameâ FOURTH. Revenge! we'll be reveng'd! OMNES. Revenge! RevengeâAway! Away with him! [Exeunt with Osman. SCENE II. The Street. The expell'd Aga and Lieutenant of the Janizaries meeting. LIEUTENANT. O! Aga; what a wretched World we live in? The Porte is all Confusion!âWhat brought you here? Be cautious. AGA. Hearing a Treaty was propos'd, And Matters like to be accommodated, I ventur'd forth (in Safety, as I thought) In this Disguise; but long I had not roam'd, When the most fatal, and afflicting Sight, My Eyes had e'er 'till then beheld, appear'd; Osman! the brave, the valiant, gen'rous Osman! Conducted like a dang'rous Criminal, Amid the Shouts, the Taunts, th'Execrations, Of the insulting, barb'rous Janizaries: He, still the Prince, and all Benignity: Patience sat smiling on his awful Brow, Temper'd with Majesty, serenely great: He urg'd the Soldiers to dispatch his Life, And not commit him to the Executionerâ My Heart dropt Blood at the detested Spectacle, And was the only one among the Croud, That, touch'd with Sense of Horror, shew'd Compassion. The Shops were all close shut, no Man appear'd, But backwards fled, t'avoid the tragick Sight; Nor was a Creature stirring in the Streets, But the inhuman Actors of this Sceneâ My Rage had well nigh laid me open to 'em; But not to throw an useless Life away, I master'd my Distraction by Constraint: I was resolv'd to view the End; so following Among the Croud, beheld my Prince immur'd Within the Prison of the Seven Towers: What next will be his Fate, I'm ignorant. LIEUTENANT. This is no Time for us t'appear abroad; Friendship for Osman, were a Crime unpardonable. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Seraglio. KIOSEM sola. At length I've gain'd the Summit of my Views: The Royal Diadem on Amurath's Head O'erpays my glorious Toil, and loud proclaims, That nought transcends the Genius of a Woman: E'en Man, who stiles himself Creation's Lord, And boasts superior Knowledge and Address, Is but a Dupeâ'Tis Kiosem governs allâ My Son, my Amurath reigns!âBut, ha! how reignsâ [Pausing. Does not the Diadem waver on his Head While Osman lives?âIt does, it does! That Name Strikes Terror thro' the Soul of Kiosemâ Why?âIs not the Sound of Am'rath as great As that of OsmanâUnsex thee, Kiosem; Secure the Prize of RoyaltyâI have't: [Musing. âHe can't but serve me for his late Advancement; Nay, 'tis his own Security; our Interests Are intertwin'd: But see, he's here. [Enter Daut Vizier and Bassa of Bosnia. DAUT. Thus, let Me pay m'Acknowledgments to your Highness. [Kneeling. KIOSEM. Not thus, Vizier; it shall not be, arise; Your Excellency's Merit's too conspicuous, To strongly mark'd to pass unnoticed. DAUT. Your Highness honours me with your Opinion. KIOSEM. Not mine alone, Vizier; the whole Divan Yields Approbation to our Choice, as conscious That ablest Men demand the highest Stations: Then who so fit as Daut to recompose The Tremors of the State, to aid my Amurath I'th'glorious Work of Peace, and harmonize The jarring Discord of the furious Porte? I know, my Daut, you have a piercing Genius; Like Lightning penetrate the close Recesses Of human Nature, and explore the Soul; This is the Statesman's Part: Believe me, Vizier, The Charge of Empire is no trifling Weight. DAUT. The Steersman must be ever on his Guard, Watch ev'ry Gale, from the rough Hurricane Down to the gentle Breathe; take all Advantages T'avoid the Shelves and Rocks, that in his Way, Unseen by vulgar Eyes, portend Destruction. KIOSEM. Destruction! nam'st thou? You've alarm'd my Fears! This pet'lant Boyâthis Osman! has convuls'd The State. DAUT. He can no more; in Bonds secure, What have we thence to dread? KIOSEM. Thou know'st not Osman, If fondly confident you dismiss your Fears. DAUT. There may arise Suspicion thence, 'tis possible. KIOSEM. There may, there may; nay, Men are most discerning. DAUT. Your Highness's Hints administer Suspicionâ KIOSEM. O, nothing, nothing; 'tis mere Fancy all: Our Fears oft savour of Impertinence. DAUT. Admit, my Princess, Women's often are Mere Phantoms; yet your Highness's Penetration Must not be rated by the common Standard: Let me intreat you, Madam, to explain. KIOSEM. I think, thou lov'st me, Vizier. DAUT. Dearer far Than Life or HonourâI am all Impatience. KIOSEM. I have been fanc'ing should the Soldiery Take but a slight Disgust at Amurath, (As who so upright but may tread awry) I say, I'm thinkingâOsman mayâbutâ BASSA of Bosnia. Pardon the Interruption of your Slave, Who dares presume to read your Highness's Doubts: The Soldiery pay Deference to Osman, And hold his Qualities in Estimation; Tho' they're disgusted with his fav'rite Scheme; And to ingratiate themselves again, May reinthroneâI'd not anticipate; Perhaps they're idle Fears. KIOSEM. Nay, for myself I dread not, but for Am'rath's Friends; They'll be mark'd out undoubtedly for Ruin. DAUT. I own 'tis just; I'll keep strict Guard on Osman; None shall approach: Indeed, there's Cause for Fear. KIOSEM. For Fear! Sure I've mista'en thee, Vizier; Thou art not the Man thy Princess thought thee: Is this the resolute, experienc'd Daut? Now with a Woman's Whine to whimper out, âIndeed there's Cause for Fear.ââAway, away; Thou lov'st me not. DAUT. Highly you wrong me, Madam; Command my Life on that Experiment: Propose, what would your Highness? KIOSEM. Osman livesâ DAUT. My gracious Queen! in Pity to your Slave, [Pauses. Urge me not on the Precipice of Fate. KIOSEM. As sure as Osman lives, from that same Precipice So certain Ruin waits thee. DAUT. But, my Princess! For me to offer at a Life like Osman'sâ KIOSEM. YouâYou a Statesman? and want Resolution To steal a Life pernicious to the Crown! Can th'Hand of Power, back'd by Authority, Be wanting in the Means? a Thousand offer, Amurath will hug thee for't; too well he knows His Footing insecure, while Osman lives; Then think'st thou, he'd not venerate the Hand, That should release him from his potent Rival? DAUT. Madam, you are obey'd, conclude it done. [Exeunt Kiosem and Daut. BASSA of Bosnia solus. To what curs'd Villainy is Greatness subject? The Vizier will not rest, till 'tis compleated; Vizier! why so? myself had prior Claim, What was his Merit, more than mine? By Mahomet! Not half so muchâO! I remember well, Upon the Banks of Tyre, Lub'mirski's Forces Had well nigh put to rout our num'rous Host, Had not great Osman hap'ly interven'd. Did not this Daut then meanly sculk behind, Nor once come up to back the gallant Osman? The gallant! said I? yes, the gallant Osmanâ [Pausing. âThat thou we'rt brave, thy Enemies proclaim; Has't born Indignities unparallell'd, Each gen'rous Mussulman with Shame confesses. âThen this flagitious Plot against thy Life, Be it my glorious Part to counteract: I'll to the Mufti, traverse his Designs. SCENE IV. AMURATH solus. How cumb'rous is the State of Royalty? Was it not gilded o'er with Name of Majesty, What Man would gorge the Bait? What! tho' the Voice Of Millions shouted Amurath? hail'd me Emperor! Vain is the Joy, vain is the popular Puff. Some Hours past they did as much for Osman: Heav'n knows I sought it not, nor had I Cause; Osman was ever great; his gen'rous Soul Disdain'd the murd'rous Maxims of our State, And scorn'd by Fratricide, t'ensure his Reign. O! Osman, thy unhappy Fate imbitters The Gust of Empire; but a Time will come, Thy Wrongs shall be redress'd. [Enter a Eunuch, presents a Letter. Ha! from Ashad: [Reads. âWas I Stranger to my Emperor's Goodness, I should not have presumed, to lay this undoubted Truth at his Feet. The Greatness of Amurath's Soul can't countenance enormous Villainy.âThe Life of Osman is in immediate Danger thro' the Artifices of Daut.â O! Royal Sir! reflect on his Concern for you, and fly to his Relief. Ashad.â O! Villain, Villain! most abandon'd Villain! [Exit. SCENE V. The Prison of the Seven Towers. OSMAN solus. Royalty, farewell! thy abrupt Desertion Was so unfriendly, I'll not recall thee: Thou parted'st from me with so ill a Grace, I spurn thy Quittance; I will not sooth thee: I thank thee, Mahomet! 'tis now I triumph, Crown'd with the Laurel conscious Virtue gives: I've reach'd the full Meridian of my Glory, And from that Full, now like a Meteor fall: âIs this my Palace?âHa! here Darkness reigns; Horror and grim DismayâSemblance of Chaos! E'er the Almighty spoke primÃ¦val Light. âHa! Is not that, which pierces thro' yon Dome, The Gleam of Heav'n? O! that I could ascend, Ride on the Winds, and in a Whirlwind pour, Like Perseus, to destroy the Monster, Faction, And sate my just RevengeâWhat's that which glides Along the gloomy Surface of the Wall! [Starts. The Shadow of an Emperorâthat am Iâ Be it soâHark! didn't Aphendina call? [Starts again. Ha! my prophetick SoulâSoftâsoftâ'twas she: My Wife! my Wife! what do I feel for thee? Now am I fall'n indeed, now Osman's conquer'd. Hail! King of Terrors, hail! I court thee now. [Looking round. What have I left of all my past Possessions, But this dear Relick?âAphendina's Gift, [Takes a Pocket-Book out of his Bosom. When Love and Empire crown'd our happier Hoursâ [Enter Daut. From whence com'st thou? What Message do you bring? DAUT. My Lord! I tremble to relate my Tale; This Order speaks itself from Amurath, Our gracious Sov'reign; sorry I am, my Lot should force upon me this ungrateful Office, But my great Master's Will must be obey'd. OSMAN. What do I see! The Sentence of my Death! [Reads. Have they had not enough of Blood already? 'Tis false, this cannot come from Amurath. I us'd him otherwise when in my Power: What am I guilty of? Alledge my Crime. DAUT. It is the Sultan's Pleasureâyou must die. OSMAN. As it is the last Account I am to render, Give me some time to clear myself to Heaven. [Kneels. DAUT. My Presence is expected by the Emperor; Be short, and I'll attend awhile upon you. [Enter two Mutes with Bow-Strings, on Sight of whom Osman rises. OSMAN. Are these the Messengers of Death? for shame! Lend me a Poniard to dispatch my Lifeâ I was your Emperor, let me not fall By th'ignoble Hands of Executionersâ [Endeavours to seize a Scimitar, is prevented by Daut, who makes Signs to the Mutes to proceed. You murd'ring Villains, take the just Reward Of your Barbarityâ [Knocks down one. And thou, thou Traitorâ [Another. Give me anotherâWhat a thirdâcome onâ [While he is casting the third, comes one behind and halters him. He dies. DAUT. He is dispatch'd at last; 'tis well, I'm easy. [Daut going, enter Amurath and Guards. AMURATH. O! horrid SpectacleâSecure that Wretch. [Pointing to Daut. DAUT. My Lord! [Kneels. AMURATH. Away with him to instant Death. DAUT. My Emperor! AMURATH. Away with him; no Parley with a Murderer. [Exeunt Mutes with Daut. Unhappy Prince! how art thou fallen, Osman! Fatal Vicissitude of human Greatness! âHow wast thou lately deck'd in regal Pomp! âHow wast thou blest with ev'ry manly Grace! âHow doubly blest in Aphendina's Charms! Thy future Story shall be told with Weeping, And blast the Glory of our Turkish Annals. Could not thy Virtues save thee from the Grave! No, thy superior Merit hath undone thee: Sure Heav'n regards not the Affairs of Men, Else had not Osman diedâPresumptuous Amurath! Would'st thou trace out the secret Paths of Providence? Would'st read the Book of Fate? Vain the Attempt; 'Tis well we can't: Each Enterprize of Moment Would then abortive prove; enough for Man To knowâis to submit. Bear hence the Body, And give it Royal ObsequiesâWhat's that? [As they take up the Body a Pocket-Book falls. Give me the BookâHa!ââThis to the Empress.â [Opens it, takes out a Paper and reads. Pardon, Aphendina, that I thus presumeâ âI tremble for Amurath, he knows I always lov'd him; it is from him I hope for memorable Revenge: Rest assured, my Aphendina, that Death itself shan't tear thee from the Heart of Osman.â Most gen'rous Youth! what have I lost in thee? Thy Race was short, but gloriousâRevenge thee! Yes, yes, my Osman, I will revenge thee. Unhappy Osman!âBear this to th'Empress. [Gives the Book. Going, is stopt by the Sultana Queen, who enters with Attendants, forcing thro' the Guards. MIRZA. Off! give me Way; I seek the Emperorâ O Amurath! behold a wretched Woman Implores thy Mercy for the Life of Osman: His Soul, unqualified to taste of Death, Breathes only Love and Amity to youâ [Amurath pointing to the Corpse, she shrieks. Has the rude Grasp of Death then seiz'd my Osman! Surely the Course of Nature is inverted, And Order feels the Pangs of Dissolutionâ Is Amurath cruel? has his recreant Will Giv'n Sanction to this horrid Parricide? AMURATH. No, Mirza, I disdain the trait'rous Deed; Would I had died to've sav'd the Life of Osman! [Exit Amurath. MIRZA. Infernal Furies rattle o'er their Heads, Impending Vengeance, for eternal Ages, Shake their curs'd Souls with Horrors infinite, Whose Hands unnat'ral revell'd in his Blood! âBut why lives Mirza to lament his Fall? Why does she loiter on this hated Globe? The World's no longer thine, dispatch thee henceâ [Stabs herself. Go, seek thy Osman thro' the Fields of Paradice, Rekindle in his Breast our former Loves, And blending Shades, conjoin with him for ever. [Dies, and the Scene closes. SCENE VI. The Empress's Apartment. Aphendina and Elisana. APHENDINA. My Grief abates each Moment, Elisana, As I grow nearer to my Joys above: This News has rather chear'd, than sunk my Spirits. âI will not weep: This is my Bridal Day, Shall reconduct me to my Osman's Armsâ I may o'ertake him, if I'm expeditious: Where is the Draught I gave you? Bring it me. ELISANA. For Heaven's Sake, my Queen! don't urge me to it: I have dispos'd of it, cast it away. APHENDINA. I know thou hast not; my Commands have ever Been too minutely kept by Elisana. ELISANA. I beg you, Madam, on my Knees intreat you, Shew pity to your precious Life; it may Be all a Forgery, and done to try you. APHENDINA. I could have known it true, without Advice; I feel it in my Heart, 'tis one half weaker Than 'twas before; I know he's dead by that: Bring me the Draught, I go to meet my Osman! Deprive me not of that, my last Resort; I charge you, give it me; bring Osman's Cup, I'll drink it out of thatâO noble Osman! My Love, I come: Thou wilt not soar too fast; Stay but a Moment, Osman, I am with youâ [Takes the Draught and pours it out; knocking at the Door. Stir not 'till I have drank the Potion down. ELISANA. O! stay my Princessâ [Knocking again; while she is gone, Aphendina drinks. Madam, your Father. [Enter Ashad. ASHAD. O! Aphendina, you have Cause to grieve; The horrid Action of this Day, my Child! Staggers Belief, disclaims all Precedent: But let us not despair, my Aphendina; True Fortitude consists in nobly suffering. Ha! what means this, Child? [Seeing the Cup. APHENDINA. O! my Father, pardon. ASHAD. I fear thou'st rashly swerv'd from Virtue's Path; Art quitting, without Leave, the Post allotted thee By HeavenâThink on thy Osman, Aphendina! He persever'd, nor dar'd, with impious Hand, Abridge his Life; but gloriously fell, O'erborne by MultitudeâBe not outdone, My Child, in Virtue; live, revenge his Cause. APHENDINA. My Father! every Nerve's unstrung. ELISANA. Madam, be comforted. ASHAD. Despair not, Aphendina, Am'rath's good; His Bosom glows with ev'ry Royal Virtue, Worthy of Achmet's Son, and Osman's Brother. âThy Osman's Death will amply be reveng'd. APHENDINA. Great Mahomet! inspire the glorious Causeâ O! might I liveâbut Fate forbids the Wish; Forgive me, Heav'n! if rashlyâO! my Father. [Fainting, the Mufti supports her. ASHAD. Help, Elisana! fly for instant Succour! APHENDINA. It is too lateâa Damp has chill'd my Heart, And tells meâthat I soon shall meetâmy Osman. [Enter Servant with the Pocket-Book; Aphendina sees it and shrieks. ASHAD. My Child! my Aphendina! why that Shriek? APHENDINA. It wasâmy Osman'sâO!âI canâno more. [Dies. ASHAD. Art thou then gone, my ever dearest Child! âYes, thou art at ReposeâWould I were so!â If this be Death, who would not court their Exit. [Enter Amurath and Attendants. AMURATH. Most rev'rend Ashad! see thy PrinceâI come Not to display the Pomp of sov'reign Majesty, Dress'd in the Frowns of Ottoman Severity; But to join Plaints for Loss of noble Osman, And sooth the gentle Aphendina's Grief. ASHAD. Your Goodness, Sir, demands my humblest Thanks: My Child, my Aphendina! is at rest; Her Cares are all compos'd; a downy Slumber Has overtaken her Senses, and she's happy. AMURATH. It joys me much, good Ashad; may her Griefs Soon lose their Poignancy, grow more supportable; Nor shall my Aid be wanting. ASHAD. O! my Prince, Her Woes have reach'd the Heart of Aphendina; The icy Hand of Death has clos'd her Eyes: Alas! she sleeps, Sir, never more to wake. AMURATH. What means my Ashad? ASHAD. Aphendina's gone To Blissâto Osmanâne'er to part again. [Amurath goes to view her. AMURATH. O! Aphendinaâlovely, virtuous Bride! How are the Roses faded on thy Cheeks! Yet, thou art lovely e'en in Death; the Smile Triumphant sitting on thy Brow, denotes Thou'st met thy OsmanâThey are happy, Ashad. ASHAD. They are, my Prince. AMURATH. I need not teach you, Mufti, How to submit to the Decrees of Heaven. ASHAD. O! Aphendinaâ AMURATH. What does thy Emp'ror feel! âShe has not fall'n unpitied by me, Mufti; Osman, nor she, like vulgar Dust shall sleep, Without a Tribute paid to their Remains: Each miscreant Heart, that but design'd their Fall, O'er them shall bleed, to purge its foul Disloyalty: âHence let us humbly hope, nor dare t'arraign The Ways of ProvidenceâTho' by Permission, The Generous, the Brave, th'Ignoble fall; And like Events promiscuous chance to All: Some happier Scene awaits, some future Heaven, To counterpoize, and set the Balance even. The End of the Fifth Act.</field>
