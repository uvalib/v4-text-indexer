      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âThe Outside of the Castle of Altorf.âAlpine Scenery in the Background. Enter Waldman and Michael. Wal. Don't tell me, Michael! Thou dost lead a life As bootless as a jester'sâworse than his, For he has high retaining. Every one Calls thee his foolâthe gallant and the boy, The gentle-born and base! Thy graceless name Is ever tagg'd to feasts, and shows, and games, And saucy brawls, which men as young as thou Discourse of with grave looks. What comes of this? Will't make thee rich? Will't give thee place in life? Will't buy thee honour, friendship, or esteem? Will't get thee reverence 'gainst grey hairs? Mic. Good father!â Wal. The current of thy life doth counter run To that of other men's. Thy spirits, which Were reason in thee, when thou wast a child, As tameless still, now thou'rt become a man, Are folly! Thriftless life, that may be call'd More rational, when in the nurse's lap, Than when in manhood's chair. Survey those towers, And act the revel o'er of yesternight! Think of the tyrants whom they lodge, and then Link hands with fools and braggarts o'er their wine! Fancy the sounds their dungeons hear, and tell Of such and such a joke of thine, that made Thy wanton comrades roar! Mic. Dear father! Wal. Pshaw! Thou canst not try to speak with gravity, But one perceives thou wagg'st an idle tongue! Thou canst not try to look demure, but, spite Of all thou dost, thou show'st a laugher's cheek! Thou canst not e'en essay to walk sedate, But in thy very gait one sees the wag, That's ready to break out in spite of all Thy seeming! Mic. I'm a melancholy man, That can't do that which with good will I would! I pray thee, father, tell me what will change me? Wal. Hire thyself to a sexton, and dig graves. Never keep company but at funerals. Beg leave to take thy bed into the church, And sleep there. Fast, until thine abstinence Upbraid the anchorite with gluttony. And when thou talk'st reflection, feast on naught But water and stale bread. Ne'er speak, except At prayers and grace; and as to music, be Content with ringing of the passing-bell When souls do go to their account. Mic. But if The bells, that ring as readily for joy As grief, should chance to ring a merry peal, And they should drop the corseâ Wal. Then take the rope, And hang thyself. I know no other way To change thee. Mic. Nay, I'll do some great feat yet. Wal. You'll do some great feat! Take me Gesler's castle! Mic. Humph! that would be a feat, indeed! I'll do it! Wal. You'll do it? You'll get married, and have children, And be a sober citizen, before You pare your bread o'the crust! You'll do it? You'll Do nothing! Live until you are a hundred, When death shall catch you, 'twill be laughing. Do it? Look grave, talk wise, live sober, thou wilt do A harder thing, but that thou'lt never do. [Waldman goes out. Mic. Hard sentence, that! Dame Nature! gentle mother, If thou hast made me of too rich a mould To bring the common seed of life to fruit, Is it a fault? Kind Nature, I should lie To say it was. Who would not have an eye To see the sun, where others see a cloud? A skin so temper'd as to feel the rain, Gave other men the ague, him refresh'd? A frame so vernal, as, in spite of snow, To think it's genial summer all year round; And bask himself in bleak December's scowl, While others sit and shiver o'er a hearth? His worship's self, I've heard, when he was youngâ Some fifty years agoâwas even such A man! Shall I upbraid my heart because It hath been so intent to keep me in An ample revenue of precious mirth, It hath forgot to hoard the duller coin That worldlings trade on? No, not I, no more Than I would empt my coffers of their gold, Were they so furnish'd, to make room for brass; Or disenthrone the diamond of my ringâ Supposed the gemmÃ©d toy my finger woreâ To seat a sparkless pebble in its place! Yet here comes that, despite my wealth of mirth, Can make a beggar of me! Father, could You see me now, you'd find me sans a smile In all my jester's scrip! Enter Gesler's Archers, escorting some Swiss Peasants, prisoners; they cross the Stage, and enter the Porch of the Castle, âTell, at a short distance, following them. Tell. [To Michael, who is looking after them as they enter the porch.] Do you know them? Mic. No. Tell. Nor I, thank Heaven! How like you that? Mic. What? Tell. That. Mic. I like it not. Tell. It might as well be you or I. Mic. It might. Tell. Do you live in Altorf? Mic. Yes. Tell. How go they on In Altorf? Mic. As you see. What was a sight A month ago, hath not the wonder now To draw them 'cross the threshold! Tell. Would you likeâ Mic. What wouldst thou say to me? Tell. No matter, friend. Something so slight, that in the thinking on't 'Twas gone. The field of Grutli, Tell!âThe hour's At hand. The spirits are expecting thee, Shall bring thy country back the times again She'd wonder this to see! Mic. Stay, friend! a word. If of my mind thou haply art, and think'st, When fortune will not make us theme of mirth, Ourselves may take the task in handâ Tell. For mirth!â Good day! [Exit hastily. Mic. Acquaintance briefly broke as made! Take Gesler's castle, did my father say? Would I were well within the ramparts, and At large as now! I might do such a thing. Soft! Who comes here? Jagheli! Ha! a youth, That's tender as a love-sick damsel's sigh. What brings him sighing here? The Seneschal Has a fair daughter! Friend Jagheli, mind Thy secret. Half on't I have got already Without thy leave; the rest thyself shalt give me. [Retires. Enter Jagheli and three Savoyards, with guitars. Jag. You know the air, I'm sure. 'Tis very sweet: The young musician who composed it loved; But 'twas a bootless flame! You must have heard The story? It is said he taught the lady, Who was of high degree, and made that strain To sing to her the love he dared not speak:â Don't you remember it? The sequel was A mournful one! The lady liked the strain, But did not see the tender minstrel's drift; And still she'd have him sing it, which he did With pining heart, o'er hopeless labour breaking! He sung it till he died!âand then, at last, The lady found his theme; when, strange to tell! With sweet contrition she dissolved away, And ne'er press'd bridal bed, save the cold one They made for her beside him! Draw thy hand Across the strings, and wake thy saddest chord: Perchance 'twill mind me of it. Thou hast hit it! See if the rhymes I've strung for it agree. [Michael listens at the back of the stage, unseen by Jagheli and Savoyards. AIR.âSavoyards. Lady, you're so heavenly fair! Though to love is madness, still Who beholds you can't forbear, But adores against his will. Reason warms the heart in vain! Headlong passion won't obey! Hope's deceived, and sighs again! Love's abjured, yet holds its sway! Mic. I pray you, have the ditty o'er again! Of all the strains that mewing minstrels sing, The lover's one for me! I could expire To hear a man, with bristles on his chin, Sing soft, with upturn'd eyes, and archÃ©d brows, Which talk of trickling tears, that never fall, And through the gamut whine his tender pain; While A and B and C such anguish speak, As never lover felt for mistress lost. Let's have the strain again! Jag. To make thee mirth? When I'm thy lackey, honest Michael, I'll Provide thee music. There, with thanks to boot. [Gives money to Savoyards, who go out. I am not in thy pay. Mic. No; but I mean To take thee into it. Wilt thou hire with me? Nay, hang thy coyness, man! Why, thinkest thou Thou art the only man in Altorf knows The Seneschal has a fair daughter? Jag. Fair Or not, she's nought to me. Mic. Indeed? Oh, then, I'll tell her so! Jag. You do not know her? Mic. No; For any profit it can bring to thee. I pray thee, tell me, hath she not black teeth? Jag. Thou know'st 'twould take the pearl to challenge them! Mic. Her nose, I think, is somewhat set awry? Jag. It sits like dignity on beauty's face! Mic. Her hair is a dull black? Jag. 'Tis shining gold! Mic. Her figure's squat? Jag. Betwixt the full and slimâ A mould where vie the richest charms of both! Mic. Well, then, she hobbles in her gait? Jag. She moves the light and flexile chamoisâ If you could lend the chamois her beauty, And add to that her modest stateliness! Mic. You are a hopeful painter, sir! How well You've drawn the daughter of the Seneschal! Jag. Good Michael, thou'rt a jester; but thou'rt kind. Thy mirth doth feast at every man's expense; Yet with such grace of frankest confidence, That none begrudge thee. Wilt thou be my friend? I love the daughter of the Seneschal; Help me to see her. Mic. Come to church with me Next Sunday. Jag. I was there last Sunday, Michaelâ And Sunday before lastâand Sunday, too, Preceding that. I ne'er miss church, for there I see the daughter of the Seneschal. Mic. How wondrously devout thou'rt grown of late! They say there is a young man in the church That has his prayers by heartâunless, indeed, He reads them in a certain angel's face; On which he looks, and says them word for word, From end to end, nor e'er is seen to turn To other page. Can it be thou they mean? Thou'lt have a name for most rare sanctity! Jag. Good Michael, canst thou help me? Mic. If I knew The lady. Jag. What! dost thou not know her, then, With what impediments is love environ'd! Mic. Why, that's love's gain! It would not else be love. Love's the impediments that lovers meet; Or wherefore sing it, as your poets do, A thing that lives in plots and stratagems? They know not love who need but woo to wed, But they who fain would wed, but dare not woo! That's to be sound in loveâto feel it from The heart's deep centre to the fingers' ends! As sweetest fruit is that which is forbid, So fairest maid is she that is withheld. Whene'er I fall in love, I'll pick a maid Whose sire has vow'd her to a nunnery; And she shall have, moreover, for her warders, Two maiden aunts, past wooing; and to these I'll add an abigail, who has stood bridesmaid To twenty younger cousins, yet has ne'er Been ask'd herself; and under her I'll set A male retainer of the family, For twenty years or more, as surly as A mastiff on the chain; and, that my fair May lack no sweet provocative of love, Her tempting lattice shall be grated, and Her bower shall be surrounded with a wall Full ten feet high, on which an iron row Of forkÃ©d shrubs shall stand and frown on me: And then I'll be a lover! Jag. Show me how Thou'dst win thy love by winning mine for me. Mic. Hush! here's the servant of the Seneschal; A dog he sends on errands, without brains To take them half a yard? What wouldst attempt To win the daughter of the Seneschal? Wouldst enter Gesler's castle? Jag. Yes! Mic. The manâ The very man for me!âAside, and mark! [They retire. Enter Braun, from Porch. Bra. Three yards of buckramâRight! Thread thereuntoâ But how much thread?âA hank? A hank's too much To sew three yards of buckram! It must be A skein. A skein it is!âRight there. What next? Twelve buckles with the strapsâThat is, twelve straps, Oh, very right! In the fourth place, a score Of needlesâTwenty needles to the score. I'm right again, by that! And lastlyâWhat Comes lastly? Something is behind, I know, For I bethought me of my fingers, to Enter Seneschal. Remember, there were five things I should get; And what's the fifth? Or have I counted wrong? There's buckram, oneâthread, twoâa skein of thread, Twelve buckles, and the strapsâThe straps and they Do go togetherâthree: the fourth thing is A score of needles. There's my little finger Remaining yet. I'd give my hand to know For what that finger stands. Sen. What stands it for? Bra. Dear master! Sen. Dolt! Bra. Kind master! Sen. Jackanapes! What stands it for? Bra. I'll tell, but give me time. Sen. What time? a day? a week? a month? a year? Or till my daughter's dead? Bra. I was to fetch A leech to cure your daughter. Sen. Wast thou so? Wilt thou forget again? [Shaking his cane at him. Bra. No, sir! Sen. Thou wilt! Or that, or something else. Bra. Indeed, sir, no! Sen. Then say thy errand o'er again! Say't out! See thou are right in every tittle on't, Or look to't. Now! Bra. Three yards of buckramâ Sen. No! Begin with the leech. Bra. I set the leech against My little finger, sir. Sen. Begin with him! Bra. My little finger, sir, stands for the leech. Sen. I say, begin with the leech! Bra. I will! I will! Well, then, the leech. I go to bring him to My lady, your daughter; for she's sick. Sen. Go on. Mic. [Aside to Jagheli.] Jagheli, thou must play the leech! Away! [Jagheli goes out. Sen. Go on. Bra. Three yards of buckram, I'm to fetch; Twelve buckles and the straps; and to conclude, A score of needles. Sen. [Striking him.] Rascal, where's the thread To sew the buckram? Bring'st thou needles, fool! And not the thread? Eh, starling? Eh? Wilt sew The buckram without thread? Mic. [Coming forward, and striking him.] Eh? rascal! Eh? Heard ever mortal man the like of this? Eh, platter! tankard! nightcap! good for naught Except to eat, and drink, and sleep! Forget Thy errand! Serve thy worthy master thus! Thy patient master! thy kind master!âGet Three meals a day, thy lodging, clothing, hire, And civil words to boot; and yet not be Trustworthy to the fetching of a skein Of thread! Eh! Stomach!âMaster Seneschal, I'll run your errand straight. A leech; three yards Of buckram; thread; a skein; a gross of needlesâ Bring needles without thread! Eh? gullet!âand A dozen buckles with the straps. Sen. Good lad! What art thou, prithee? Mic. Sir, a sober youth, Son to a worthy burgher of the town; Was brought up in a monastery, has Read Greek and Latin, knows to cast accounts, And writes a hand as good as any clerk's In Altorf, sir, with sundry other gifts, As people say, but which 'twere not discreet In me to speak of. Sen. Why, a modest lad. Dost want a service? Mic. Not as varlets want A service, sir, who let their duty out For coin; I have enough: but I would serve For love at any time, especially The Seneschal of Altorf. Shall I run Your errand? Sen. Why, a model of a youth! Thou shalt. Give him the money, sir. Bra. The money! Mic. Ay, Sit-over-meals! can I provide the things Without the money? Sen. Rascal, where's the money? Bra. I put it in this pocket, sir, I'm sure I put it in this pocket! [Feeling for it. Sen. Empty it, sir. Mic. [Searching the pocket.] What's this? A crust of cheese! O ne'er-content! Sen. Well! where is it? Bra. Or could it be in this? Sen. Out with't. Mic. [Searching the other pocket.] What's here? a head of garlic, and A capon's leg! O cormorant! Sen. The money! Bra. Yes, sir! Sen. Thy vest, try that! The money, sirrah! Bra. Good sir, this instant! Sen. Instant, dog! Wilt swear Thou'lt find it in an hour? Mic. Or in a day. Eh? lack-grace! knave! incorrigible knave, To chafe so sweet a temper'd gentlemanâ What's that thou keep'st the last three fingers of Thy careful hand upon? Bra. The money!âThere's The money. [Opens his hand slowly, and shows the money. Sen. Give it him! Mic. A patch, a rag, The tatter of a serving man! To carry His master's money in his greasy hand, Or think of thrusting it into his pokeâ Receptacle of musty eatablesâ Cheese, garlic, scraps of meat, to wit; instead Of lodging't in a safe and comely purse. I'll run your errand, sir. Three yards of buckram; A skein of thread; a score of needles, and Twelve buckles with straps; not to forget To bring a leech to cure your daughter, sir. A turnspit curâI'll run your errand, sir! [They go out severally. SCENE II. âThe Field of Grutli.âA Lake and Mountains. Enter Tell, with a long bow. Tell. Ye crags and peaks, I'm with you once again! I hold to you the hands you first beheld, To show they still are free. Methinks I hear A spirit in your echoes answer me, And bid your tenant welcome home, again! Hail!âHail! O sacred forms, how proud you look! How high you lift your heads into the sky! How huge you are! how mighty, and how free! How do you look, for all your barÃ©d brows, More gorgeously majestical than kings Whose loaded coronets exhaust the mine! Ye are the things that towerâthat shineâwhose smile Makes gladâwhose frown is terribleâwhose forms, Robed or unrobed, do all the impress wear Of awe divineâwhose subject never kneels In mockery, because it is your boast To keep him free! Ye guards of liberty, I'm with you once again!âI call to you With all my voice! I hold my hands to you To show they still are free! I rush to you As though I could embrace you! Erni [without]. William! William! Tell. [Looks out.] Here, Erni, here! Enter Erni. Erni. Thou'rt sure to keep the time, That comest before the hour. Tell. The hour, my friend, Will soon be here. O, when will liberty Be here? My Erni, that's my thought, which still I find beside. Scaling yonder peak, I saw an eagle wheeling near its brow: O'er the abyss his broad expanded wings Lay calm and motionless upon the air, As if he floated there without their aid, By the sole act of his unlorded will, That buoy'd him proudly up. Instinctively I strung my bow; yet kept he rounding still His airy circle, as in the delight Of measuring the ample range beneath, And round about, absorb'd, he heeded not The death that threaten'd him!âI could not shoot!â 'Twas liberty. I turn'd the shaft aside, And let him soar away! Verner [without]. Tell!âTell! Enter Verner. Tell. Here, Verner! Furst [without]. Tell! Enter Furst. Tell. Here, friends!âWell met!âDo we go on? Ver. We do. Tell. Then you can reckon on the friends you named? Ver. On every man of them. Furst. And I on mine. Erni. Not one I sounded, but doth rate his blood As water in the cause! Then fix the day Before we part. Ver. No, Erni: rather wait For some new outrage to amaze and rouse The common mind, which does not brood so much On wrongs gone by, as it doth rankle with The sense of present ones. Tell. [To Verner.] I wish with Erni, But I think with thee. Yet when I ask myself On whom the wrong shall light for which we waitâ Whose vineyard they'll uprootâwhose flocks they'll ravageâ Whose threshold they'll profaneâwhose hearth polluteâ Whose roof they'll fire?âWhen this I ask myself; And think upon the blood of pious sons, The tears of venerable fathers, and The shrieks of mothers, fluttering round their spoil'd And nestless youngâI almost take the part Of generous indignation, that o'erboils At such expense to wait on sober prudence! Furst. Yet it is best. Tell. On that we're all agreed! Who fears the issue when the day shall come? Ver. Not I! Furst. Nor I! Erni. Nor I! Tell. I'm not the man To mar this harmonyâNor I, no more Than any of you! You commit to me The warning of the rest. Remember, then, My dagger sent to any one of youâ As time may pressâis word enough. The others I'll see myself. Our course is clear.âDear Erni, Remember me to Melchtal.âFurst, provide What store you can of arms. Do you the same. [To Erni and Verner. The next aggression of the tyrant is The downfall of his power?âRemember me To Melchtal, Erni:âto my father. Tell him He has a son that was not born to him! Farewell!âWhen next we meet upon this theme, All Switzerland shall witness what we do! [They go out severally. SCENE III. âA Chamber in the inside of the Castle, with an open window. Enter Anneli and Agnes. Ann. Art sure thou heard'st him? Agn. Do I hear you, coz? As sure did I hear him, and see him, too, From yonder casement. Ann. Sweet! look out again! Perhaps he lingers there. Agn. I wonder, cousin, You'd send another's eyes to look for that You'd give your own to see! You silly thing! Look out yourself. [They go to the window. Ann. Ah, sweet! look out for me! For should he not be there, 'twill pain me less To miss him by your eyes than by my own. In sooth, you've set my heart a beating so, I know not, coz, if I have ears or eyes To see or hear him! Agn. Well, lend me your hand, To help me up. [Anneli assists Agnes to climb up to the casement.] Dear love, you tremble so You'll pull me down! Oh, silly, silly thing, To be so scared at what you so desire! Ann. Fear, coz, you know, is offspring to desire. Agn. A gentle mother to a froward child! Love finds out wonders, coz; but find not I The thing I look for. No; he is not there. Ann. Nay, look again. Agn. I cannot make him there By looking, cozâCould you? Ann. I would I could! I'd look my eyes blind till he came. Agn. Indeed! And see him then? Ann. And see him then! The thought That I might see him then would bring me back My sight. Agn. It would! oh, wonder-working love! I would not have you risk your sight, dear coz; But I would have you try another thing, You'd run no risk to lose, unless they wrong Our sex, who say its voice is lasting as 'Tis sweet. Sing, coz! He'll hear and come. Come, sing. Ann. Sing, coz! Agn. Ay, sing! Ann. Am I not sick?âconfined To my own chamberâsick, cozâdoubly sickâ For hate of one I would not wed; for love Of one I would? Have they not sent just now To bring the leech to see me? And you'd have Me sing! Oh, thoughtless coz! Agn. For too much thought! Never at rest to do my cousin good. Did I not bid thee hate the Castellain, When thou didst say thou couldst not love him, coz? Did I not bid thee love the burgher's son, When thou didst say thou ne'er couldst love but him? And when thy father swore he'd have thee wed, And thou didst vow thou'dst sooner die than wed! Did I not bid thee, coz, fall sick at once, And die? And now, when to the casement comes The man thou'dst wish the casement, door, and all, Were open to; would I not have thee sing, To let him know there's neither bolt nor bar? He'd wish to draw in love and honesty, You'd wish him not? But, cousin, as you say You're sick, and as for your sweet health 'tis good That others think so, I'll try and e'en Sing for you, coz. AIR.âAgnes. O well you ride, Sir Knight, O well Your courser you bestride; But you'd ride better could you tell Who sees you as you rideâ Not your lady, Sir Knightânot your lady, Sir Knight, But her father, who wishes you far out of sight. O well you sing, Sir Knight, O well Your ditty you rehearse; But you'd sing better could you tell Who lists your tender verse.â Not your lady, Sir Knightânot your lady, Sir Knight, But your rival, who's fretting and fuming for spite. O well you climb, Sir Knight, O well You climb to your lady's bower; But you'd climb better could you tell Who sees you scale the tower. 'Tis your lady, Sir Knightâ'tis your lady, Sir Knight, Who wishes the tower was not half the height. O fast you fly, Sir Knight, O fast You urge your laden steed; But you'd ride slower, if you guess'd How little is the need. They have turn'd to the leftâyou've taken the right, And you should be wedding, not riding, Sir Knight. Enter the Seneschal. Sen. How now! What's this? Ha! Singing at the casement? Agn. To please my cousin, sir. Sen. How? Anneli! Agn. I coax'd her from her chamber. Change, they say, Is physic to the sick, when medicine More costly's virtueless! Sen. And who made thee A doctor? Agn. Nature! Sen. Nature? Yes, I doubt not 'Twas nature taught thee change was good! it is Thy sex's universal remedyâ Physic they swallow without making faces, Anneli! Ann. Sir? Sen. Art better, girl? Ann. No, sir. Sen. Better or worse I'll have thee soon. The leech Will straight be hereâHe should be coming now. Thy chamber! Ann. [To Agnes.] Should he find I am not ill! Agn. He'll find he's not a ducat richer by it, So never fear!âHe'll find thee very ill. If thou'rt not well until he makes thee so, Thou shalt be sick, coz, to thy heart's content! [Anneli goes out. Sen. Agnes. Agn. Yes, sir. Sen. What says thy cousin? Agn. Nought. Sen. What didst thou say to her? Agn. I told her, sir, To keep her heart up, and not fear the leech. Sen. Not fear the leech! Agn. E'er since you spoke of him, She has done nothing, sir, but talk of lancets, Caustics, and blisters; powders, nauseous draughts, With fifty other shocking things, that much I fear me, sir, she will feign well, to cheat The leech. Sen. Ha! think'st thou so? Agn. I'm sure on't, sir. She has been practising e'er since you named him. Sen. I thought she look'd much better! Agn. Better, sir! She's worse, much worse! The mischief's inward, sir. In short, she's dyingâdying, sir: and yet She'd sooner die than undergo the leech. Sen. Ne'er fear, ne'er fear! She shall not cheat him so. I'll not believe him, though he says she's well. I'll make him think her ill. No drug he has But shall be fully tried on her. His pills, Emplastrums, ointments, julaps, cataplasms, Shall take their turn with her; and if these fail, We'll bring his knives and lancets to her; nor, When all is done, shall he give o'er, until She's well again, and weds the Castellain Enter Braun. Braun. The leech is here, sir. Enter Michael, with Jagheli, disguised as a Leech. Mic. Sir, I've brought the gentleman, And all the articles you bade me get. Sen. Good lad, and active! Welcome, sir! Methinks He's very young. Art sure he is a leech? Mic. A leech, sir! Ay, and such a one!âThere's not His fellow to be found in Altorf, sir. Remember, sir, it is the use of time, Not time itself, that's written in our looks. Forty is younger far than twenty, sir, When that sees husbanding, but this does not. But never take my word for't! Only try His lancetâDo, sirâ'Tis miraculous How skilfully he can phlebotomize. No scratch, sir, prick of a pin, or flea-bite, sir, But real blade-work. Let him bleed you, sir! Sen. On second looks, methinks he's not So young. Mic. Past forty, sir. Sen. Past forty! Come, Take ten from that. Mic. Ten, sir!âI pray you, lady, Provide a ribbon for the Seneschal, And something soft to make a compress of. [Agnes goes out. Ten do you say, sir? Ten? Ten years ago He bled and blister'd meâI'll show you, sir, The mark of his lancet. Sen. Nay, good youth, don't strip Thy sleeve! Mic. Strip yours, then, sir, and let him try His skill upon you. Fetch a basin, rascal! [Braun goes out. 'Twill do you good, sir. For a healthy man, You're over-full of blood. To lose a little Will benefit you much. Your cheek's a tint Too florid, sir. There's indigestion in't, Which breeds vertigo; for preventing which [Getting a chair. There's nothing like the breathing of a vein. Re-enter Agnes, with a ribbon, &amp;c.; Braun, with a basin. Mic. Sit down, sir. Sen. Nay, good lad!â [Sits. Mic. Good master leech, Your case of instruments, wherein you store Your lancets, scalpels, and your scarifiersâ The Seneschal wants bleeding. Sen. No, no, no! [Rises up and runs. I am content that he's a man of skill. Mic. Just let him take a single ounce of blood, To see how he can use a lancet, sir. Sen. I tell thee, no!âI'm sure he is a leech.â Mic. But half an ounce. Sen. Good youth, I would not wrong The worthy man, by asking him to take A single drop. I'm sure he is a leech! One needs but look at him to know that he Can bleed; and for his years, to see him close, He's far from young; past forty, at the least. Good sir, put up your case of instruments, And come along with me to see my daughter. And, Agnes, give this youth a cup of wine, With what you have that's best, to relish it. A most sagacious leech, I'm sure!âA leech Than whom none ever better look'd his calling. [They go out. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âTell's Cottage on the right of a Mountainâa distant view of a Lake, backed by Mountains of stupendous height, their tops covered with snow, and lighted at the very points by the rising Sun, the rest of the distance being yet in shadeâon one side a Vineyard. Enter Emma, from the Cottage. Emma. O, the fresh morning! Heaven's kind messenger, That never empty-handed comes, to those Who know to use its gifts.âPraise be to him Who loads it still, and bids it constant run The errand of his bounty!âPraise be to him! We need his care that on the mountain's cliff Lodge by the storm, and cannot lift our eyes, But piles on piles of everlasting snows, O'erhanging us, remind us of his mercy! Albert appears on an eminence. Alb. My mother! Emma. Albert! Alb. [Descending.] Bless thee! Emma. Bless thee, Albert! How early were you up? Alb. Before the sun. Emma. Ay, strive with him. He never lies a-bed When it is time to rise. He ever is The constant'st workman, that goes through his task, And shows us how to work by setting to't With smiling face; for labour's light as ease To him that toils with cheerfulness. Be like The sun. Alb. What you would have me like, I'll be like, As far as will to labour join'd, can make me. Emma. Well said, my boy! Knelt you when you got up To-day? Alb. I did; and do so every day! Emma. I know you do! And think you, when you kneel, To whom you kneel? Alb. To Him who made me, mother. Emma. And in whose name? Alb. The name of Him who died For me and all men, that all men and I, By trust in him, might live. Emma. Remember that! Forget all things but thatâremember that! 'Tis more than friends or fortune; clothing, food; All things of earth; yea, life itself. It is To live when these are gone, where they are nought With God!âMy son, remember that! Alb. I will! Emma. You have been early up, when I, that play'd The sluggard, in comparison, am up Full early; for the highest peaks alone, As yet, behold the sun. Now tell me what You ought to ponder, when you see the sun So shining on the peak? Alb. That as the peak Feels not the pleasant sun, or feels it least! So they, who highest stand in fortune's smile, Are gladden'd by it least, or not at all! Emma. The lesson that remember'd pays the teacher! And what's the profit you should turn this to? Alb. Rather to place my good in what I have, Than think it worthless, wishing to have more; For more is not more happiness, so oft As less. Emma. I'm glad you husband what you learn. That is the lesson of content, my son; He who finds which, has allâwho missesânothing! Alb. Content is a good thing. Emma. A thing, the good Alone can profit by. Alb. My father's good. Emma. What say'st thou, boy? Alb. I say my father's good. Emma. Yes; he is good! What then? Alb. I do not think He is contentâI'm sure he's not content; Nor would I be content, were I a man, And Gesler seated on the rock of Altorf! A man may lack content, and yet be good. Emma. I did not say all good men find content.â I would be busy; leave me. Alb. You're not angry? Emma. No, no, my boy. Alb. You'll kiss me? Emma. Will I not! The time will come you will not ask your mother To kiss you! Alb. Never! Emma. Not when you're a man? Alb. I would not be a man to see that time: I'd rather die, now that I am a child, Than live to be a man, and not love you! Emma. Liveâlive to be a man, and love your mother! [They embraceâAlbert runs off into the cottage. Why should my heart sink? 'tis for this we rear them! Cherish their tiny limbs; pine if a thorn But mar their tender skin; gather them to us Closer than miser hugs his bag of gold; Bear more for them than slave, who makes his flesh A casket for the rich purloinÃ©d gemâ To send them forth into a wintry world To brave its flaws and tempests!âThey must go; Far better, then, they go with hearty will! Be that my consolation.âNestling as He is, he is the making of a bird Will own no cowering wing. 'Twas fineâ'Twas fine To see my eaglet, on the verge o' the nest, Ruffling himself at sight of the huge gulf He feels anon he'll have the wing to soar! Re-enter Albert from the Cottage, with a bow and arrows, and a rude target, which he sets up during the first lines, laying his bow and quiver on the ground. What have you there? Alb. My bow and arrows, mother. Emma. When will you use them like your father, boy? Alb. Some time, I hope. Emma. You brag! There's not an archer In all Helvetia can compare with him! Alb. But I'm his son; and when I am a man, I may be like him. Mother, do I brag To think I some time may be like my father? If so, then is it he that teaches me; For ever as I wonder at his skill, He calls me boy, and says I must do more When I become a man! Emma. May you be such A man as he!âIf Heaven wills, better!âI'll Not quarrel with its work; yet 'twill content me If you are only such a man! Alb. I'll show you How I can shoot. [Shoots.] Look, mother! there's within An inch! Emma. O fy! it wants a hand. [Going into the cottage. Alb. A hand's An inch for me. I'll hit it yet. Now for it! [Shoots again. [While Albert continues to shoot, the light gradually approaches the base of the mountains in the distance, and spreads itself over the lake and valley. Enter Tell, watching Albert some time in silence. Tell. That's scarce a miss that comes so near the mark! Well aim'd, young archer! With what ease he draws The bow! To see those sinews, who'd believe Such vigour lodged in them? Well aim'd again! There plays the skill will thin the chamois' herd, And bring the lammer-geyer from the cloud To earth. Perhaps do greater featsâPerhaps Make man its quarry, when he dares to tread Upon his fellow-man! That little arm, His mother's palm can span, may help, anon, To pull a sinewy tyrant from his seat, And from their chains a prostrate people lift To liberty! I'd be content to die, Living to see that day!âWhat, Albert! Alb. Ah!â My father! [Running to Tell, who embraces him. Emma. [Running from the cottage.] William!âWelcome, welcome, William! I did not look for you till noon, and thought How long 'twould be ere noon would come! You're comeâ How soon 'twill now be here and gone! O William! When you are absent from me, I count time By minutes; which, when you are here, flies by In hours, that are not noted till they're out! Now this is happiness! Joy's doubly joy That comes before the timeâIt is a debt, Paid ere 'tis due, which fills the owner's heart With gratitude, and yet 'tis but his own! And are you well? and has the chase proved good? How has it fared with you? Come in; I'm sure You want refreshment, William. Tell. No; I shared A herdsman's meal, upon whose lonely chalet I chanced to light. I've had bad sport! My track Lay with the wind, which to the startlish game Betray'd me still. One only prize; and that I gave mine humble host. You raise the bow Too fast. [To Albert, who has returned to his practice.] Bring't slowly to the eyeâ [Albert shoots. You've miss'd. How often have you hit the mark to-day? Alb. Not once yet. Tell. You're not steady. I perceived You waver'd now. Stand firm!âLet every limb Be braced as marble, and as motionless. Stand like the sculptor's statue on the gate Of Altorf, that looks life, yet neither breathes Nor stirs. [Albert shoots.] That's better! Emma. William! William!âO! To be the parents of a boy like that!â Why speak you notâand wherefore do you sigh? What's in your heart to keep the transport out That fills up mine, when looking on our child, Till it o'erflows mine eye? [Albert shoots. Tell. You've miss'd again! Dost see the mark? Rivet your eye to it! There let it stick, fast as the arrow would, Could you but send it there! Emma. Why, William, don't You answer me? [Albert shoots. Tell. Again! How would you fare, Suppose a wolf should cross your path, and you Alone, with but your bow, and only time To fix a single arrow? 'Twould not do To miss the wolf! You said, the other day, Were you a man, you'd not let Gesler liveâ 'Twas easy to say that. Suppose you, now, Your life or his depended on that shot!â Take care! That's Gesler! Now for liberty! Right to the tyrant's heart! [Albert shoots.] Well done, my boy! Come here!âNow, Emma, I will answer you: Do I not love you? Do I not love our child? Is not that cottage dear to me, where I Was born? How many acres would I give That little vineyard for, which I have watch'd And tended since I was a child? Those crags And peaksâwhat spirÃ©d city would I take To live in, in exchange for them?âYet what Are these to me? What is this boy to me? What art thou, Emma, to meâwhen a breath Of Gesler's can take all! Emma. O, William, think How little is that all to himâtoo little For Gesler, sure, to take. Bethink, thee, William, We have no treasure. Tell. Have we not? Have we No treasure? How! No treasure? What! Have we not liberty?âthat precious ore, That pearl, that gem, the tyrant covets most; Yet can't enjoy himselfâfor which he drains His coffers of their coinâhis land of blood; Goes without sleepâpines himself sallow-paleâ Yea, makes a pawn of his own soulâlacks easeâ Frets, till the bile gnaws appetite awayâ Forgets both heaven and hell, only to strip The wearer of it! Emma, we have that, And that's enough for Gesler! Emma. Then, indeed, My William, we have much to fear! Tell. We have; And best it is we know how much. Then, Emma, Make up thy mind, wife! Make it up! Remember What wives and mothers on these very hills Once breathed the air you breathe. Helvetia Hath chronicles, the masters of the world, As they were call'dâthe Romansâkept for her; And in those chronicles I've heard 'tis writâ And praise set down by foes must needs be trueâ 'Tis writ, I say, that when the Rhetiansâ They were the early tenants of those hillsâ Withstood the lust of Roman tyranny, With Claudius Drusus, and a certain Nero, Sons-in-law of Octavius CÃ¦sar, at Its headâthe Rhetian womenâwhen the men By numbers overmatch'd at last gave wayâ Seeing that liberty was gone, threw life And nature, too, as worthless, after it; Rush'd through the gaping ranks of them that fled, And on the dripping weapons of the red Resistless van impaled themselves and children! Emma. O, William! Tell. Emma, let the boy alone! Don't clasp him soâ'Twill soften him! Go, sir! See if the valley sends us visitors To-day. Some friend, perchance, may need thy guidance. Away! [Albert goes out.] He's better from thee, Emma! The time Is come, a mother on her breast should fold Her arms, as they had done with such endearments, And bid her children go from her, to hunt For dangerâwhich will presently hunt themâ The less to heed it! Emma. William, you are right. The task you set me I will try to do. I would not live myself to be a slaveâ I would not live to be the dam of one! No! woman as I am, I would not, William! Then choose my course for me. Whate'er it is, I will say, ay, and do it, tooâSuppose To dress my little stripling for the war, And take him by the hand, and lead him to't! Yes, I would do it at thy bidding, William, Without a tearâI say that I would do itâ Though, now I only talk of doing it, I can't help shedding one! [Weeps. Tell. Did I not choose thee From out the fairest of the maids of Uri, Less that in beauty thou didst them surpass, Than that thy soul that beauty overmatch'd? Why rises on thy matron cheek that blush, Mantling it fresh as in thy virgin morn, But that I did so? Do I wonder, then, To find thee equal to the task of virtue, Although a hard one? No, I wonder not! Why should I, Emma, make thy heart acquainted With ills I could shut out from itârude guests For such a home! Here, only, we have had Two hearts; in all things elseâin love, in faith, In hope, in joyâthat never had but one! But henceforth we must have but one, here, also. Emma. O, William, you have wrong'd meâkindly wrong'd me! When ever yet was happiness the test Of love in man or woman? Who'd not hold To that which must advantage him? Who'd not Keep promise to a feast, or mind his pledge To share a rich man's purse? There's not a churl, However base, but might be thus approved Of most unswerving constancy. But that Which loosens churls, ties friends! or changes them, Only to stick the faster. William! William! That man knew never yet the love of woman, Who never had an ill to share with her! Tell. Not even to know that would I in so Ungentle partnership engage thee, Emma, If will could help it; but necessity, The master yet of will, how strong soe'er, Compels me, prove thee. When I wedded thee, The land was free! O! with what pride I used To walk these hills, and look up to my God, And bless him that it was so! It was free!â From end to end, from cliff to lake 'twas free!â Free as our torrents are that leap our rocks, And plough our valleys, without asking leave; Or as our peaks that wear their caps of snow, In very presence of the regal sun! How happy was I in it then! I loved Its very storms! Yes, Emma, I have sat In my boat at night, when, midway o'er the lake, The stars went out, and down the mountain gorge The wind came roaringâI have sat and eyed The thunder breaking from his cloud, and smiled To see him shake his lightnings o'er my head, And think I had no master save his own! You know the jutting cliff round which a track Up hither winds, whose base is but the brow To such another one, with scanty room For two a-breast to pass? O'ertaken there By the mountain blast, I've laid me flat, along; And while gust follow'd gust, more furiously, As if to sweep me o'er the horrid brink, And I have thought of other lands, whose storms Are summer flaws to those of mine, and just Have wish'd me thereâthe thought that mine was free Has check'd that wish, and I have raised my head, And cried in thraldom to that furious wind, Blow on! This is the land of liberty! Emma. I almost see thee on that fearful pass, And yet, so seeing thee, I have a feeling Forbids me wonder that thou didst so. Tell. 'Tis A feeling must not breathe where Gesler breathes, But may within these arms! List, Emma, list! A league is made to pull the tyrant down! E'en from his seat upon the rock of Altorf. Four hearts have staked their blood upon the cast, And mine is one of them. Emma. I did not start!â Tell me more, William! Tell. I will tell thee all.â Alb. [without]. O, father! Old Melchtal [without]. Tell!âTell!âWilliam! Emma. Don't you know That voice! Enter Old Melchtal, blind, led by Albert. Old M. Where art thou, William? Tell. Who is it? Emma. Do you not know him? Tell. No!âIt cannot be The voice of Melchtal! Alb. Father, it is Melchtal! Emma. What ails you, Tell? Alb. O, father, speak to him! Emma. What passion shakes you thus? Tell. His eyes!âWhere are they? Melchtal has eyes. Old M. Tell! Tell! Tell. 'Tis Melchtal's voice. Where are his eyes? Have they put out his eyes? Has Gesler turn'd the little evening of The old man's life to night, before its time? To such black night as sees not with the day All round it! Father, speak! Pronounce the name Of Gesler! Old M. Gesler. Tell. Gesler has torn out The old man's eyes! Support thy mother! Erni? Where's Erni? Where's thy son? Is he alive? And are his father's eyes torn out? Old M. He lives, my William, But knows it not. Tell. When he shall know it! O! Heavens, When he shall know it!âI am not thy son, Yetâ Emma. [Alarmed at his increasing vehemence.] William!âWilliam! Alb. Father! Tell. Could I find Something to tearâto rend, were worth it!âsomething Most ravenous and bloody!âsomething like Gesler!âa wolf;âNo, no! A wolf's a lamb To Gesler! It is a natural hunger makes The wolf a savage; and, savage as he is, Yet with his kind he gently doth consort. 'Tis but his lawful prey he tears; and that He finishesânot mangles, and then leaves To live! I'd let the wolf go free, for Gesler!âWater! My tongue cleaves to my roof! Old M. What ails thee, William? I pray thee, William, let me hear thy voice! That's not thy voice! Tell. I cannot speak to thee! Emma. [Returning with a vessel of water.] Here, William! Tell. Emma! Emma. Drink! Tell. I cannot drink! Emma. Your eyes are fix'd. Tell. Melchtal!âHe has no eyes! [Bursts into tears. The poor old man! [Falls on Melchtal's neck. Old M. I feel thee, Tell! I care not That I have lost my eyes! I feel thy tearsâ They're more to me than eyes! When I had eyes, I never knew thee, William, as I know Thee now, without. I do not want my eyes! Tell. How came it, father? briefly, father!âquick And briefly! Action! action! I'm in such glee For workâso eager to be doingâhave Such stomach for a task, I've scarcely patience To wait to know what 'tisâHere, here: sit down. Now, father! [Old Melchtal sits down.âTell kneels. Old M. Yesterday, when I and Erni Went to the field, to bring our harvest home, Two soldiers of the tyrant's came upon us, And, without cause alleged, or interchange Of word, proceeded to unyoke the oxen. Tell. Go on! Old M. As one stunn'd by a thunder-clap Stands sudden still, nor for a while bethinks him Of taking shelter from the storm; so we, Confounded by an act so bold, a while Look'd on in helpless silence; till at length Erni, as sudden as the hurricane, That lays the oak uprooted, ere you see Its branches quiver, bounding on the spoilers, Wrench'd from their grasp the yoke, and would have smote Them dead, had they not ta'en to instant flight! Tell. Did he pursue them? Old M. No; I threw myself Between! Tell. Why didst thou save them? Old M. 'Twas my son I saved! I clasp'd his kneesâI calm'd his rage, I forced him from me to the caverns of Mount Faigel, William, till the tyrant's wrath Might cool, or be diverted. 'Twas my son I saved: for, scarcely was he out of sight, And I within my cottage, when the cries Of Gesler's bands beset it, calling for The blood of Erni! William, he was safe!â Clear of their fangs! My son was safe! O, thinkâ Think, William, what I felt to see his lairâ His very lairâbeset, and know my boy,â My lion boy, was safe! Enough! They seized me, And dragg'd me before Gesler. Tell. Say no more! His life cost you your eyes! 'Tis worth a pair Of eyes, but not your eyes, old man! No, no; He would have given it ten times over for But one of them. But one? But for a hair O' the lash! My bow and quiver! He was by? Old M. Was by. Tell. More arrows for my quiver. And looking on? Old M. And looking on. Tell. [Putting the arrows into his quiver.] 'Twill do! He would dine after that, and say a grace! He would! To tear a man's eyes out, and then Thank God!âMy staff!âHe'd have his wine, too. How The man could look at it, and drink it off, And not grow sick at the colour on't! Enough; Put by the rest. [To Emma, who has brought him a bundle of arrows.] I'll grow more calm! My flaskâI want it fill'd; and put provision Into my pouchâI thank thee for that look! Now seem'st thou like some kind o'er-seeing angel, Smiling as he prepares the storm, that, while it Shakes the earth, and makes its tenants pale, Doth smite a pestilence. Thou wouldst not stay me? Emma. No! Tell. Nor thy boy, if I required his service? Emma. No, William! Tell. Make him ready, Emma. Old M. No! Not Albert, William! Emma. Yes; even Albert, father. Thy cap and wallet, boyâthy mountain staff,â Where hast thou laid it? Find itâhaste! Don't keep Thy father waiting. He is ready, William! [Leading Albert up to Tell. Tell. Well doneâWell done! I thank you, loveâI thank you! Now mark me, Albert! Dost thou fear the snow, The ice-field, or the hail-flaw? Carest thou for The mountain mist, that settles on the peak When thou'rt upon it? Dost thou tremble at The torrent roaring from the deep ravine, Along whose shaking ledge thy track doth lie? Or faint'st thou at the thunder-clap, when on The hill thou art o'ertaken by the cloud, And it doth burst around thee? Thou must travel All night! Alb. I'm ready. Say all night again. Tell. The mountains are to cross; for thou must reach Mount Faigel by the dawn! Alb. Not sooner shall The dawn be there than I. Tell. Heaven speeding thee! Alb. Heaven speeding me! Tell. Show me thy staff.âArt sure O' the point? I think 'tis loose. NoâStayâ'Twill do! Caution is speed when danger 's to be pass'd. Examine well the creviceâDo not trust The snow! 'Tis well there is a moon to-night. You're sure o' the track? Alb. Quite sure. Tell. The buskin of That leg 's untied. Stoop down and fasten it. You know the point where you must round the cliff? Alb. I do. Tell. Thy belt is slackâDraw't tight. Erni is in Mount Faigel. Take this dagger, And give it him. You know its caverns well. In one of them you'll find him. Bid thy mother Farewell. Come, boy! We go a mile together. Father, thy hand. [Shakes hands with Old Melchtal. Old M. How firm thy grasp is, William! Tell. There is a resolution in it, father, Will keep. Old M. I cannot see thine eye, but I know How it looks! Tell. I'll tell thee how it looks. List, father, List. Father, thou shalt be revenged! My Emma, Melchtal's thy father. That's his home till I Return. Yes, father, thou shalt be revenged! Lead him in, Emma, lead him in. The sun Grows hotâThe old man's weak and faint! Mind, father, Mind, thou shall be revenged! In, wifeâInâIn. Thou shalt be sure revenged! Come, Albert! [Emma and Melchtal enter the cottage.âTell and Albert go out hastily. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âA Mountain with Mist. Gesler is seen descending the Mountain with a hunting-pole. Ges. Alone, alone! and every step the mist Thickens around me! On these mountain tracks To lose one's way, they say, is sometimes death. What hoa! holloa!âNo tongue replies to me! No thunder hath the horror of this silence! I dare not stop!âThe day, though not half run, Is not less sure to end night; and night, Dreary when through the social haunts of men Her solemn darkness walks, in such a place As this, comes wrapp'd in most appalling fear! I dare not stop; nor dare I, yet, proceed; Begirt with hidden danger! If I take This hand, it carries me still deeper into The wild and savage solitudes I'd shun, Where once to faint with hunger is to die! If this, it leads me to the precipice, Whose brink with fatal horror rivets him That treads upon't; till, drunk with fear, he reels Into the gaping void, and headlong down Plunges to still more hideous death! CursÃ©d slaves! To let me wander from them! [Thunder.] Hoa!âHolloa! My voice sounds weaker to mine ear! I've not The strength to call I had; and through my limbs Cold tremor runs, and sickening faintness seizes On my heart! O heaven, have mercy! Do not see The colour of the hands I lift to thee! Look only on the strait wherein I stand, And pity it! Let me not sink! Uphold,â Support me! Mercy! mercy! I shall die! [He leans against a rock, stupified with terror and exhaustionâit grows darker and darkerâthe rain pours down in torrents, and a furious wind arises âthe mountain streams begin to swell and roar. Albert is seen descending by the side of one of the streams, which in his course he crosses with the help of his pole. Alb. I'll breathe upon this level, if the wind Will let me. Ha! a rock to shelter me! Thanks to't. A man, and fainting! Courage, friend, Courage! A stranger that has lost his wayâ Take heart!âTake heart; you're safe. How feel you now? [Gives him drink from a flask. Ges. Better. Alb. You have lost your way upon the hill? Ges. I have. Alb. And whither would you go? Ges. To Altorf. Alb. I'll guide you thither. Ges. You're a child. Alb. I know The way. The track I've come is harder far To find. Ges. The track you've come! What mean you? Sure You have not been still farther in the mountains? Alb. I've travelled from Mount Faigel. Ges. No one with thee? Alb. No one but God. Ges. Do you not fear these storms? Alb. God's in the storm! Ges. And there are torrents, too, That must be cross'd. Alb. God's by the torrent, too! Ges. You're but a child. Alb. God will be with a child! Ges. You're sure you know the way? Alb. 'Tis but to keep The side of yonder stream. Ges. But guide me safe, I'll give thee gold! Alb. I'll guide thee safe without. Ges. Here's earnest for thee. [Offers gold.] HereâI'll double that, Yea, treble it, let me but see the gate Of Altorf. Why do you refuse the gold? Take't. Alb. No. Ges. You shall. Alb. I will not. Ges. Why? Alb. Because I do not covet it; and, though I did, It would be wrong to take it as the price Of doing one a kindness. Ges. Ha!âwho taught Thee that? Alb. My father. Ges. Does he live in Altorf? Alb. No, in the mountains. Ges. How!âa mountaineer? He should become a tenant of the city; He'd gain by't. Alb. Not so much as he might lose by't. Ges. What might he lose by't? Alb. Liberty. Ges. Indeed! He also taught thee that? Alb. He did. Ges. His name? Alb. This is the way to Altorf, sir. Ges. I'd know Thy father's name. Alb. The day is wastingâWe Have far to go. Ges. Thy father's name, I say? Alb. I will not tell it thee. Ges. Not tell it me! Why? Alb. You may be an enemy of his. Ges. May be, a friend. Alb. May be; but should you be An enemyâAlthough I would not tell you My father's name, I'd guide you safe to Altorf. Will you follow me? Ges. Ne'er mind thy father's name: What would it profit me to know't? Thy hand; We are not enemies. Alb. I never had An enemy! Ges. Lead on. Alb. Advance your staff As you descend; and fix it well. Come on! Ges. What! must we take that steep? Alb. 'Tis nothing! Come! I'll go beforeâNe'er fear. Come onâCome on! [They go out. SCENE II. âAn Apartment in the Castle of Altorf. Enter Michael and Jagheli. Jag. Yes, Michael, so it stands. She only is Step-daughter to the Seneschal. The less Her debt of duty; which, though it were more, She were absolved from by the tyrant's part He acts, who weds her where she loathes, not loves. O, win her for me, Michael, or you'll have To get a leech for me. Mic. Get thee a leech? I'll be in want of one Myself! Thy sickness is infectious. Would A scalded foot had kept me to the houseâ A fever tied me to my bedâa fit Tripp'd up my heels in the street, ere I had met thee, To play the leech for thee! I was as sound As reckless laughter, then; could eat or drink With him that ask'd meâcould go here or there And find me ample fund of mirth, where'er I wentâcould singâcould danceâcould keep awake Or sleep as well as any one! You've sped me! Concluded me!âbrought all my fair estate Of rich content to melancholy end! Jagheli, I'm in love. Jag. In love! Mic. In love? Jag. Michael in love!âWhat, prithee, made thee fall In love? Mic. A cup of wine. Jag. Another cup Will work thy cure. Mic. If thou couldst give me with't The hand that help'd me to't, and with the hand The lip that kiss'd the cup ere it touch'd mine.â Nor was it yet the hand, nor yet the lip, But the arch smile that quiver'd on the lip And seem'd to mock the motion of the hand, Moving in maiden coyness. Plague on't! I've Been posed at mine own trade!âproved an apprentice With mine own tools!âMaster'd wherein I bragg'd, To show my skillâand only by a smile Half shownâyou scarce could tell if it was there Or notâa glimpse and gone, and then again A glimpse and gone again, ere you could say You saw it!âI'm in love.âI have it here!â Here in the very centre of my heart! That ever I should live to see the day, I fell in love. Jag. Psha! Michael! You in love! You have been laughing till you've got a stitch In the side. Mic. A stitch! If thou hast such another, It will not let thee sleep. But hither comes Thy lady's chamberlain, with dulcet voice, To call thee to her. Now her father's out, Make profit of thy calling, master leech, Or follow it no more! Enter Braun. Braun. My lady says She'll see you, sir.âCome this way. Mic. Mind! Jag. I will. [Braun and Jagheli go out. Mic. I'd like to try a race with him in love. Can he compare with me in such a strife?â With me, could talk him dumb at any time? Ere he began to woo, I should be doneâ But, to be done, a man must needs begin. Enter Agnes, unobserved by Michael. Agn. What!âMischief plotting?â'Tis a graceful cheat! Rogue as he is, the man 's a man to love. Mic. Hang modesty! Agn. Well said! When that doth die, No cousin goes of thine, to put thee to The charge of mourning. Mic. I'll take heart, and woo Her soundly! Agn. Love have pity on her, then! Mic. This very hour I'll tell her I'm in love. Agn. This very hour she'll tell thee thou'rt a fool. Mic. I'll marry her in a week. Agn. You'll wait, perhaps, A little longer. Mic. Nay, a week's too long! Three days from this. Agn. Why not to-morrow, sir? You'd be as near your wedding. Mic. Send her now, Kind CupidâSend her now. I'm in the mood To woo her. Agn. What, if she's not in the mood To come? Mic. In such a mood, that were she marble, I'd soften herâor ice, I'd make her melt. Agn. O dear! Mic. Or steel itself, she should become As gently ductile as the generous ore Comes nearest to her worth, and, yet, not more Than sums it half, although 'twere virgin gold! Agn. I'll fly!â Mic. Now, Cupid, now, I'll conquer her In all her charms that vanquish'd at a sight! By every arrow in thy quiver, boy, If thou hast made me smartâshe shan't go free; So send her to me. Agn. Nay, in sooth I'll stay. Who ever fear'd a boaster? Mic. Cupid, now! Boy, I would stake my heart against thy wings, I'd woo, and win, and wed her in a day! Agn. [Coming forward.] O, sir, you are the youth that brought the leech. Mic. [Confused.] Ma'am? Agn. And a pretty leech it is you've brought. Mic. Ma'am? Agn. He must needs have practised very long, To be so sapient and profound a leech! Where studied he, I pray you? Mic. [Stammers.] Studied, ma'am? Agn. Yes, studied! [Imitating him.] Thinkest thou a leech is made By only putting on the coat of one? At such a rate, you would, yourself, be one, Instead of his good trusty serving-man. Mic. His serving-man! Agn. Yes, sir, that pounds his drugsâ The half of which I wot are poisonousâ Makes ready his emplastrumsâfilthy things! Boils his decoctions, and makes up his powders, Ointments, and mixtures: I am sure I've seen you In your working clothes, without that Sunday chin You now have on, beating a tune upon The leech's mortarâto the which you sang In such melodious strain, that, one and all, The passers-by did stop their ears, o'ercome With surfeit of the sweetness! Mic. Madam,âWhy, Michael! Dear Michael! What are you about? Are you a man? Agn. What wages do you get, Besides the blows the leech bestows on you, When you forget to make his nostrums up, Or mar them in the mixing? Mic. Blows! Agn. Ay, blows. Come, come; don't look so fierce! You're just the man To take them kindly, as, indeed, you should. For I can read, sir, by your face, you're dull Of wit, and slow of comprehension; nor Of memory careful in the hoarding of What's trusted to it. If the worthy leech But beats thee once a week, he's not more wise Than patient. Mic. [Aside.] Michael, thou hast found thy match! But wilt thou yield without a struggle for't? No!âCourage, Michael! Now or never, man! [Struts up to Agnes.] Ma'am! Agn. Bless me; sir, perhaps I may be wrong! And you are not his serving-man? Mic. No, ma'am. Agn. Nor anything under the leech? Mic. No, ma'am. Agn. Then, I will e'en make bold to tell you, sir, I think the leech is just as much a leech As you are. Mic. Ma'am! Agn. I've found him out, sir. Mic. Have you? Agn. And found out youâYou shall be flay'd alive, sir, For passing him for a leech. A pretty way To make my cousin well! Mic. Your cousin, ma'am? I took you for the lady's abigail! Come, come, you areâor nature in her work Shows little thrift, so fitting things for ends They come not toâYou are her abigail! Agn. I vow I'm not! Mic. Your voice with which you vow Protests you are. Agn. My voice! Mic. 'Tis of the pitch That chills the lover's hopeâthat answers ânoâ To all his sighs; the which, when daughters hear, They straight bethink them of a breaking heart! My uncle had an abigail with just Your voice. Agn. Indeed? Mic. Indeed! She was a match For twenty lovers that my cousin had. Not one of them could move her! Then your eyeâ Agn. Ay, what of that? Mic. Why such an eye should go With such a voice! There's watchfulness in it. 'Twas made to pierce disguises, and to look On pleading lovers, as on stocks and stones! Agn. Your uncle's abigail, I guess, had such An eye, too? Mic. Yesâa little softer, though, In its fire.âAnd then your dress!â Agn. What of my dress? [Angrily. Mic. Why, 'tis put on in perfect shrew-fashion, Like armour, straight, and square, and stiff! It speaks Defiance to male-kind! Were Twenty-one To put it on, 'twould look Two-score! Wast thou A beauty now, and teased with lovers, such A dress as that would free thee from them all. Agn. Art thou in earnest now? Mic. In earnest! Yes. I'll take an oath thou art her abigailâ As much as I'm the leech's serving-man,â As much as he's the leech. Sweet, we are both True serving-men to love; and you're the hire; I serve for. [Catching her in his arms. Agn. [Disengaging herself.] Stay!âWho serves for hire must wait Till it be given him, ere he takes his hire; He must not help himself. Mic. But give me mineâ Agn. Hush!âSome one comes. Mic. I'm mute as faith That's sworn to silence. Let me keep thy hand. [They retire near, and remain unseen by Braun. Enter Braun. Braun. Now, Braun, whoever after calls thee âdroneâ Doth lie, and men shall tell him so. Thou'rt wise, Watchful, and keen of sight; canst see when all The house besides, with open eyes, are blindâ Stone blind. Thou shalt no more be Braun, the dolt, The sluggard Braun, the hound, the hog, or Braun The good-for-naught; or everything, but Braun Himself! Thou shalt be honest Braunâgood Braun!â Braun that can see a thing!âcan find it out Before the Seneschal!âbrave Braun!âThe leech Is but a cheatâmy lady but a cheat,â Her sickness all put on. He is to come On Wednesdayâno, to-day is Wednesdayâno, Wednesday was yesterday. He is to comeâ I have forgot the day; no matter. I Remember he's to come, and that's enough. He is to come atâPlague upon the hour! 'Twas not at breakfast-hour, or dinner-hour, Or any hour of meals or sleepâI'm sure Of that; but then, what signifies the hour, When I've forgot the day? Most trueâmost true; A lucky thought. No matter what the hour, Or what the day; 'tis what he purposed at The hour and the day, concerns me to remember, And that I don't forget. He is to come To take away my lady mistress, who Is nothing loth. Remember that, good Braun, And make thy fortune with the Seneschal. [Goes out. Agnes and Michael advance. Agn. Undoneâundone! If thou remain'st, 'tis death! Mic. And if I fly, what fly I to but death? Agn. Nay, save thy life. Mic. Thou art its precious breath, And, parted from thee, 'tis no longer life. Agn. Could I believe thee! Mic. If thou wouldst, thou couldst. There lack of power is only lack of will. Agn. Nay, say not so; in sooth, I've all the will. Mic. Then, here, I plight my faith to thee! Agn. Nay, hold! Mic. 'Tis done, sweet maid, and cannot be recall'd! So give me vow for vow. No sentinel Keeps watch beneath the casement where you sleep: There could I hang, by aid of this kind night, A ladderâsuch a one as lovers find Their way by to their mistress' arms, when doors Are barr'd against themâThou'rt not happy here! This house of wolves is no abode for thee! Let's to our friends, and briefly, ere we part, Resolve the means and time for meeting; ne'er To part again! Agn. You'll take the abigail? Mic. If you will take the leech's serving-man. [They go out. SCENE III. âThe Gate of Altorf. Enter Gesler and Albert. Alb. You're at the gate of Altorf. [Returning. Ges. Tarry, boy! Alb. I would be goneâI am waited for. [Going. Ges. Come back! Who waits for thee? Come, tell me; I am rich And powerful, and can reward. Alb. 'Tis close On evening!âI have far to go!âI'm late! Ges. Stay! I can punish, too. Alb. I might have left you, When on the hill I found you fainting, with The mist around you; but I stopp'd and cheer'd you, Till to yourself you came again. I offer'd To guide you, when you could not find the way, And I have brought you to the gate of Altorf! Ges. Boy, do you know me? Alb. No. Ges. Why fear you, then, To trust me with your father's name?âSpeak. Alb. Why Do you desire to know it? Ges. You have served me, And I would thank him, if I chanced to pass His dwelling. Alb. 'Twould not please him, that a service, So trifling, should be made so much of! Ges. Trifling? You've saved my life. Alb. Then do not question me, But let me go! Ges. When I have learn'd from thee Thy father's name. What hoa! [Knocks at the gate. Sentinel. [Within.] Who's there? Ges. Gesler! [The gate is opened. Alb. Ha, Gesler! Ges. [To the Soldiers.] âSeize him! Wilt thou tell me Thy father's name? Alb. No! Ges. I can bid them cast thee Into a dungeon! Wilt thou tell it now? Alb. No! Ges. I can bid them strangle thee! Wilt tell it? Alb. Never! Ges. Away with him! Send Sarnem to me. [Soldiers take off Albert through the gate. Behind that boy, I see the shadow of A hand, must wear my fetters, or 'twill try To strip me of my power. I have felt to-day What 'tis to live at others' mercy. I Have tasted fear, to very sickness, and Owed to a peasant-boy my safetyâAy, My life! and there does live the slave can say Gesler's his debtor! How I loathed the free And fearless air with which he trod the hill! Yea, though the safety of his steps was mine, Oft as our path-way brink'd the precipice, I wish'd to see him miss his footing and Roll over!âBut he's in my power!âSome way To find the parent nest of this fine eaglet, And harrow it! I'd like to clip the broad And full-grown wing that taught his tender pinion So bold a flight! Enter Sarnem. Ges. Ha, Sarnem! Have the slaves, Attended me, returned? Sar. They have. Ges. You'll see That every one of them be laid in fetters. Sar. I will. Ges. Didst mark the boy? Sar. That pass'd me? Ges. Yes. Sar. A mountaineer. Ges. You'd say so, saw you him Upon the hills; he walks them like their lord! I tell thee, Sarnem, looking on that boy, I felt I was not master of those hills. He has a father!âNeither promises Nor threats could draw from him his nameâa father Who talks to him of liberty! I fear That man! Sar. He may be found. Ges. He must; and, soon As found, disposed of! I can see him now. He is as palpable to my sight, as if He stood like you before me. I can see him Scaling that rock! Yea, I can feel him, Sarnem, As I were in his grasp, and he about To hurl me o'er yon parapet! I live In danger, till I find that man! Send parties Into the mountains, to explore them far And wide; and if they chance to light upon A father, who expects his child, command them To drag him straight before us. Sarnem, Sarnem, They are not yet subdued. Some way to prove Their spirit!âTake this cap; and have it set Upon a pole in the market-place, and see That one and all do bow to it. Whoe'er Resists or pays the homage sullenly, Our bonds await him! Sarnem, see it done! [Sarnem goes out. We need not fear the spirit that would rebel But dares not:âThat which dares we will not fear! [Goes out. SCENE IV. âThe Market-Place. Burghers and Peasants, with Pierre, Theodore, and Savoyards, discovered. CHORUS. Pie. Come, come, another strain. The. A cheerful one. Sav. What shall it be? The. No matter, so 'tis gay. Begin! Sav. You'll join the burden? The. Never fear. Go on. [Savoyard plays and sings, during which Tell and Verner enter, the former leans upon his bow, and listens gloomily. The Savoyard from clime to clime Tunes his strain, and sings his rhyme; And still, whatever clime he sees, His eye is bright, his heart 's at ease. For gentle, simpleâall reward The labours of the Savoyard. The rich forget their prideâthe great Forget the splendour of their state, Whene'er the Savoyard they meet, And list his song, and say 'tis sweet; For titled, wealthyânone regard The fortune of the Savoyard. But never looks his eye so bright, And never feels his heart so light, As when in beauty's smile he sees His strain is sweet, his rhyme doth please. Oh that's the praise doth best reward The labours of the Savoyard! But, though the rich retain'd their pride, And though the great their praise denied,â Though beauty pleased his song to slight, His heart would smile, his eye be bright: His strain itself would still reward The labours of the Savoyard. [They shout, and laughingly accompany the Savoyards, who go out, with some of the crowd. Tell. What's the heart worth that lends itself to glee, With argument like theirs for bitterness? Or is't the melancholy sport of grief To look on pleasures and to handle them, That, when it lays the precious jewels down, It may perceive its poverty the more? Methinks those cheeks are not exactly dress'd To please the hearts that own them. Ver. Doubt it not. They feel their thraldom! Tell. So they should!âThat's hopeâ I'd have it gall themâeat into their flesh! Long as they fester, there's a remedy; But for your callous slave I know no cure! To-morrow brings the test, will surely prove them. You'll not forget the hour? Ver. Be sure I will not. Tell. Erni is warn'd ere this; and Furst, I've said, Is ready. Fare you well. Ver. Stay, William!âNow Observe the people. [The people have gathered to one side, and look in the opposite direction with apprehension and trouble âthose who had gone off return. Tell. Ha!âThey please me nowâ That's honest!âThat's sincere! I still preferr'd The seasons like themselves.âLet summer laugh, But give me winter with a hearty scowl. None of your hollow sunshineâFogs and clouds Become it best!âI like them now!âTheir looks Are just in season. There has surely been Some shifting of the wind, upon such brightness To bring so sudden lowering. Ver. We shall see. Pie. 'Tis Sarnem! The. [Looking out.] What is that he brings with him? Pie. A pole; and on the top of it a cap, That looks like Gesler'sâI could pick it from A hundred! The. So could I!âMy heart hath oft Leap'd at the sight of it. What comes he now To do? Enter Sarnem, with Soldiers, bearing Gesler's cap upon a pole, which he fixes into the ground; the people looking on in silence and amazement. Sar. Ye men of Altorf! Behold the emblem of your master's power And dignity. This is the cap of Gesler, Your Governor! Let all bow down to it Who owe him love and loyalty. To such As shall refuse this lawful homage, or Accord it sullenly, he shows no grace, But dooms them to the penalty of bondage Till they're instructed 'tis no less their gain Than duty, to obey their master's mandate. Conduct the people hither, one by one, To bow to Gesler's cap. Tell. Have I my hearing? [Peasants pass, taking off their hats and bowing to Gesler's cap. Ver. Away! Away! Tell. Or sight?âThey do it, Verner! They do it!âLook!âNe'er call me man again! I'll herd with baser animals! They keep Their stations. Still the dog 's a dogâThe reptile Doth know his proper rank, and sinks not to The uses of the grade below him.âMan! Man! that exalts his head above them all, Doth ape them all! He's man, and he's the reptile! Look!âLook! Have I the outline of that caitiff, Who to the tyrant's feather bends his crown, The while he loathes the tyrant? Ver. Come away, Before they mark us. Tell. No! no!âSince I've tasted, I'll e'en taste on! I 'gin, methinks, to like it. [Pierre passes the cap, smiles, and bows slightly. Sar. What smiled you at? Pie. I bow'd as low as he did! Sar. Nay, but you smiled. How dared you smile? Tell. Good!âgood! Sar. [Striking him.] Take that. Remember when you smile again, To do't in season. Ver. Come away. Tell. Not yet,â Why would you have me quit the feast, methinks, Grows richer and richer? Ver. You change colour. Tell. Do I? And so do you. Sar. [Striking another.] Bow lower, slave! Tell. Do you feel That blow?âMy flesh is tingling with't. Well done! How pleasantly the rascal lays it on! Well done! Well done! I would it had been I! Ver. You tremble, William. Come, you must not stay. Tell. Why not?âWhat harm is there? I tell thee, Verner, I know no difference 'twixt enduring wrong And living in the fear on't. Man! wear The tyrant's fetters, when it only wants His nod to put them on; and bear his stripes When, that I suffer them, he needs but hold His finger up! Verner, you're not the man To be content because a villain's mood Forbears? You're rightâyou're right! Have with you, Verner. Enter Michael. Sar. Bow, slave. [Tell stops and turns. Mic. For what? [Laughs. Sar. Obey, and question then. Mic. I'll question, now, perhaps not then obey. Tell. A man!âA man! Sar. 'Tis Gesler's will that all Bow to that cap. Mic. Were it thy lady's cap, I'd courtesy to it. Sar. Do you mock us, friend? Mic. Not I. I'll bow to Gesler, if you please; But not his cap, nor cap of any he In Christendom! Tell. A man;âI say, a man! Sar. I see you love a jest; but jest not now, Else you may make us mirth, and pay for't too. Bow to the cap! Tell. The slave would humour him. Holds he but out! Sar. Do you hear? Mic. I do. Tell. Well done! The lion thinks as much of cowering As he does! Sar. Once for all, bow to that cap. Tell. Verner, let go my arm. Sar. Do you hear me, slave? Mic. Slave! Tell. Let me go! Ver. He is not worth it, Tell; A wild and idle gallant of the town. Tell. A man!âI'll swear, a man! Don't hold me, Verner. Verner, let go my arm!âDo you hear me, man? You must not hold me, Verner. Sar. Villain, bow To Gesler's cap. Mic. Noânot to Gesler's self! Sar. Seize him! Tell. [Rushing forward.] Off, off, you base and hireling pack! Lay not your brutal touch upon the thing God made in his own image! Crouch yourselves! 'Tis your vocation, which you should not call On free-born men to share with you, who stand Erect, except in presence of their God Alone! Sar. What! shrink you, cowards? Must I do Your duty for you? Tell. Let them but stir!âI've scatter'd A flock of hungry wolves, outnumbering them,â For sport I did it. Sport!âI scatter'd them With but a staff, not half so thick as this. [Wrests Sarnem's weapon from himâSarnem and Soldiers fly. What!âHa!âBeset by hares! Ye men of Altorf, What fear ye? See what things you fearâthe shows And surfaces of men! Why stand you wondering there? Why look you on a man that's like yourselves, And see him do the deeds yourselves might do, And act them not? Or know you not yourselves? That ye are men?âthat ye have hearts and thoughts To feel and think the deeds of men, and hands To do them? Fear you God, and fear you him Who fears not God, but, in his sight, defies him! You hunt the chamois, and you've seen him take The precipice before he'd yield the freedom His Maker gave him; and you are content To live in bonds, that have a thought of freedom, Which Heaven ne'er gave the little chamois. Why gaze you still with blanchÃ©d cheeks upon me? Lack you the manhood even to look on, And see bold deeds achieved by others' hands? Or is't that cap still holds you thralls to fear? Be free, then! There! Thus do I trample on The cap of Gesler, as I would on him! [Throws down the pole. Sar. [Suddenly entering with Soldiers.] Seize him! [All the people, except Verner and Michael, fly. Tell. Surrounded! Mic. Stand!âI'll back thee! Ver. Madman! [Forces Michael off. [Tell, after a struggle, is secured and thrown to the ground, where they proceed to chain him, and, then, raise him. They raise him, heavily chained, bursting with indignation, and breathless. Tell. Slaves! Sar. Rail on; thy tongue has yet its freedom. Tell. Slaves! Sar. On to the castle with himâforward! Tell. Slaves! [They go out. Re-enter Michael, still held by Verner. Mic. There!âThere!âThey bear him off! Who is he? Ver. Tell! Mic. What!âTell! Why held you me? What was my life, To save that noble lion from the toils? Ver. Michael, I knew thee not till now. I see Thou art a man to trust. If thou wouldst free That lion from the toils, there is a way. Mic. Show't me. Ver. Before this time to-morrow, Michael, The cantons will be up in arms, and here In Altorf. Mic. Ha!âThe tyrant's castle?â Ver. Yes. Mic. Verner, thou hast saved a precious life to-day In saving mine. Let's see: how many friends Can I provide me with 'twixt this and night? Ver. For what? Mic. This night I mean to win a bride, And marry her to-morrow. Ver. Art thou mad? Mic. I amâwhy not? Who'd not be mad upon The golden eve of his bright wedding-day? Don't wonder at me, Verner. Do you see Yon turret? Ver. Yes. Mic. Spy you a casement, too, Just half-way up? Ver. I do. Mic. This night to me That casement opens; and a cord, let down, Takes up a hempen ladder, strong enough For me to mount. Ver. What then? Mic. When I have won The prize I venture for, and safe bestow'd, What hinders ten or twenty of my friendsâ What hinders them, I say, to lodge with me This night in yonder turret? Come along; I've scanty time to bid so many guests. Come on; and, as we go, possess me of Your plans, the minute you're to act upon them, With all the rest! Don't wonder at me, man: You'll bless the day that Michael took a wife. [They go out. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âA Chamber in the Castle. Enter Gesler, with Rodolph, Lutold, Gerard, and Officers. Ges. [To Rodolph.] Double the guards. Stay! place your trustiest men At the postern. Stop! You'd go with half your errand: I'll tell you when to go! Let every soul Within the walls be under arms! The sick That do not keep their beds, or can rise from them, Must take a weapon! Can they only raise A hand, we've use for them. Away now. Tumult [Rodolph goes out. Under our very brows! The slaves will come, In torrents from the hills, and, like a flood, O'erwhelm us! Lutold, 'tis our final order, On pain of death, no quarter shall be given! Another word!âLet them be men, this once, I promise them the sacking of the town! Without reserve, I give it themâof property Or soul! I've nothing further, sir. [Lutold goes out.] I'll raze Their habitations, hunt them from their hills, Exterminate them, ere I'll live in fear! What word now? [To Rodolph, who re-enters. Rod. 'Twas a false alarm. The people Paid prompt submission to your order: one Alone resisted, whom they have secured, And bring in chains before you. Ges. SoâI breathe Again! 'Twas false, then, that our soldiers fled? Rod. 'Twas but a party of them fled, my lord; Which, reinforced, return'd, and soon o'erpower'd The rash offender. Ges. What! fled they from one? A single man? How many were there? Rod. Four, With Sarnem. Ges. Sarnem! Did he fly? Rod. He did; But 'twas for succour. Ges. Succour! One to four, And four need succour? I begin to think We're sentinell'd by effigies of men, Not men themselves. And Sarnem, too! What kind Of man is he that made a tiger cower? Yea, and with backers! I should like to see That man. Rod. He's here. Ges. I'm on the hills again! I see their bleak tops looking down upon me, And think I hear them ask me with a scowl If I would be their master. Do not sheathe Your swords!âStand near me!âBeckon some of those About me. I would be attended. If He stirs, despatch him. Rod. He's in chains, my lord. Ges. I seeâI see he is. Enter Sarnem and Soldiers, with Tell in chains. Sar. Down, slave! Behold the Governor. Down!âDown! and beg For mercy! Ges. [Seated.] Does he hear? Sar. Debate it not. Be prompt. Submission, slave! Thy kneeâthy knee! Or with thy life thou playest. Rod. Let's force him to The ground. Ges. Can I believe my eyes? He smiles! Ger. Why don't you smite him for that look? Ges. He grasps His chains as he would make a weapon of them To lay the smiter dead. What kind of man Is this, that looks, in thraldom, more at large, Than they who lay it on him? Rod. Lo you how The caitiff scowls! Pull out his eyes! Lut. Lop off A limb for him! Ges. A heart accessible as his to trembling The rock or marble hath. They fear far more To inflict than he to suffer. Each one calls Upon the other to accomplish that Himself hath not the manhood to attempt! Why don't they take him from my sight? Behold! He has brought them to a pause; and there they stand Like things entranced by some magician's spell, Wondering that they are masters of their organs, And not their faculties. They gaze on me As one expected to perform a part Which he forgets to fill. [Rises.] They must not see me So lost. Come, draw thy breath with easeâthou'rt Geslerâ Their lord; and he's a slave thou look'st upon! Canst thou not mulct the villain in his life? Hast thou not tortures to requite him with? 'Tis only in the absence of thy wrath He braves it. Let it show itselfâat once He's passive as the dust thou tread'st upon! Why speak'st thou not? Tell. For wonder. Ges. Wonder! Tell. Yes, That thou shouldst seem a man! Ges. What should I seem? Tell. A monster! Ges. Ha! BewareâThink on thy chains. Tell. Though they were doubledâThough they weigh'd me down Prostrate to the earth, methinks I could rise up Erect with nothing but the honest pride Of telling thee, usurper, to the teeth, Thou art a monster! Think upon my chains! Show me the link of them, which, could it speak, Would give its evidence against my word. Think on my chains! They are my vouchers, which I show to Heaven, as my acquittance from The impious swerving of abetting thee In mockery of its lord!âThink on my chains! How came they on me? Ges. Darest thou question me? Tell. Darest thou not answer? Ges. Do I hear? Tell. Thou dost! Ges. Beware my vengeance! Tell. Can it more than kill? Ges. Enough, it can do that. Tell. No; not enough! It cannot take away the grace of lifeâ Its comeliness of port that virtue givesâ Its head erect with consciousness of truthâ Its rich attire of honourable deedsâ Its fair report that's rife on good men's tongues! It cannot lay its hands on these, no more Than it can pluck his brightness from the sun, Or with polluted finger tarnish it. Ges. But it can make thee writhe? Tell. It may! Ges. And groan? Tell. It may; and I may cry. Go on, though it should make me groan again! Ges. Whence comest thou? Tell. From the mountains. Wouldst thou learn What news from thence? Ges. Canst tell me any? Tell. Ay! They watch no more the avalanche. Ges. Why so? Tell. Because they look for thee! The hurricane Comes unawares upon them; from its bed The torrent breaks, and finds them in its track. Ges. What do they, then? Tell. Thank heaven, it is not thou! Thou has perverted nature in them. The earth Presents her fruits to them, and is not thank'd! The harvest sun is constant, and they scarce Return his smile! their flocks and herds increase, And they look on as men who count a loss! They hear of thriving children born to them, And never shake the teller by the hand; While those they have, they see grow up and flourish, And think as little of caressing them, As they were things a deadly plague had smit!â There's not a blessing Heaven vouchsafes them, but The thought of thee converts into a curse, As something they must loseâand richer were For ever to have lack'd! Ges. That pleases me! I'd have them like their peaks, that never smile, Though joyous summer tempt them ne'er so much. Tell. Nay, but they sometimes smile. Ges. Ay!âwhen is that? Tell. When they discourse of vengeance. Ges. Vengeance! Dare They talk of that? Tell. Ay, and expect it, too. Ges. From whence? Tell. From Heaven! Ges. From Heaven? Tell. And from the hands Which they lift up to it on every hill For justice on thee! Ges. Where is thy abode? Tell. I told theeâin the mountains. Ges. How lies it?âNorth or south? Tell. Nor north, nor south. Ges. Is't to the east or west, then? Tell. Where it lies Concerns thee not. Ges. It does! Tell. And if it does, Thou shalt not learn. Ges. Art married? Tell. Married!âYes. Ges. And hast a family? Tell. A son. Ges. A son! Sarnem! Sar. My lord, the boy! [Gesler signs to Sarnem to keep silence, and whispering, sends him off. Tell. The boy!âWhat boy? Is't mine?âand have they netted my young fledgeling? Now Heaven support me, if they have! He'll own me, And share his father's ruin! But a look Would put him on his guardâyet how to give it! Now, heart, thy nerve: forget thou'rt fleshâbe rock! They comeâThey come!âThat step!â That step!âSo light upon the ground! How heavy does it fall upon my heart! I feel my child!â'Tis he! We can but perish. Enter Sarnem with Albert, whose eyes are riveted on Tell's bow, which Sarnem carries. Alb. [Aside.] Yes; I was right. It is my father's bow! For there's my father! I'll not own him, though! Sar. See! Alb. What? Sar. Look there. Alb. What would you have me see? Sar. Thy father. Alb. That is not my father, sir. Tell. My boyâmy boy!âmy own brave boy! He's safe! Sar. [Aside to Gesler.] They're like each other. Ges. Yet I see no sign Of recognition to betray the tie That binds a father and his child. Sar. My lord, I'm sure it is his father. Look at them: That boy did spring from him; or never cast Came from the mould it fitted! It may be A preconcerted thing, 'gainst such a chance, That they survey each other coldly thus. Besides, with those who lead the mountain life, The passions are not taken by surprise As ready as with us. They commune still, From day to day, with nature's wonders; till They see her fiercest terrors without awe, And catch, from her, her stern and solemn look, That e'en their mirth seems thoughtful. Ges. [Rises.] We shall try. Lead forth the caitiff! Sar. To a dungeon? Ges. No; Into the court. Sar. The court, my lord? Ges. And tell The headsman to make ready. Quick! He dies! The slave shall die! You mark'd the boy? Sar. I did. He startedâ'Tis his father! Ges. We shall see. Away with him! Tell. Stop!âstay! Ges. What would you? Tell. Time,â A little time to call my thoughts together! Ges. Thou shalt not have a minute. Tell. Some one, then, To speak with! Ges. Hence with him! Tell. A moment, stop! Let me speak to the boy. Ges. Is he thy son? Tell. And if He were, art thou so lost to nature as To send me forth before his face to die? Ges. Well, speak with him. Now, Sarnem, mark them well. [Albert goes to Tell. Tell. Thou dost not know me, boy; and well for thee Thou dost not. I'm the father of a son About thy age. I dare not tell thee where To find him, lest he should be found of those 'Twere not so safe for him to meet with. Thou, I see, wast born, like him, upon the hills; If thou shouldst 'scape thy present thraldom, thou Mayst chance to cross him; if thou shouldst, I pray thee Relate to him what has been passing here, And say I laid my hand upon thy head, And said to theeâIf he were here, as thou art, Thus would I bless him: Mayst thou live, my boy, To see thy country free, or die for her As I do! Sar. Mark!âHe weeps. Tell. Were he my son, He would not shed a tear! He would remember The cliff where he was bred, and learn'd to scan A thousand fathoms' depth of nether air! Where he was train'd to hear the thunder talk, And meet the lightning eye to eye! Where last We spoke togetherâwhen I told him, death Bestow'd the brightest gem that graces life, Embraced for virtue's sake,âHe shed a tear! Now, were he by, I'd talk to him, and his cheek Should never blanch, nor moisture dim his eye,â I'd talk to him!â Sar. He falters. Tell. 'Tis too much! And yet it must be done! I'd talk to himâ Ges. Of what? Tell. [Turns to Gesler.] The mother, tyrant, whom thou dost make A widow of! I'd talk to him of her! [Turns to Albert. I'd bid him tell her, next to liberty, Her name was the last words my lips pronounced; And I would charge him, never to forget To love and cherish her, as he would have His father's dying blessing rest upon him! Sar. You see, what one suggests, the other acts. Tell [aside]. So well he bears it, I, almost, give way! My boy! my boy!âO, for the hills!âthe hills! To see him bound along their tops again, With liberty, so light upon his heel, That, like the chamois, he flings behind himâ Sar. Was there not all the father in that look? Ges. Yet 'tis against nature. Sar. Not if he believes Owning the boy, the son belike might share The father's fate. Ges. I did not think of that! I thank thee, Sarnem, for the thought. 'Tis well The boy is not thy son. He is about To die along with thee. Tell. To die! For what? Ges. For having braved my power, as thou hast! Lead Them forth. Tell. He's but a child. Ges. Away with them! Tell. Perhaps an only child. Ges. No matter. Tell. He May have a mother. Ges. So the viper hath; And yet who spares it for the mother's sake? Tell. I talk to stone! I talk to it as though 'Twere flesh, yet know 'tis none! No wonder! I've An argument might turn as hard a thing To fleshâto softest, kindliest flesh, that e'er Sweet Pity chose to lodge her fountain in!â But, still, 'tis naught but stone! I'll talk to it No more! Come, my boy! I taught thee how to live!â I'll show thee how To dieâ Ges. He is thy child! Tell. [Bursting into tears, and embracing Albert.] He is my child! Ges. I've wrung a tear from him! Thy name? Tell. My name? It matters not to keep it from thee, now: My name is Tell. Ges. What!âWilliam Tell? Tell. The same. Ges. What! he so famed 'bove all his countrymen For guiding o'er the stormy lake the boat? And such a master of his bow, 'tis said His arrows never miss?âIndeed!âI'll take Exquisite vengeance!âMark!âI'll spare thy life, Thy boy's, too.âBoth of you are freeâon one Condition. Tell. Name it. Ges. I would see you make A trial of your skill with that same bow You shoot so well with. Tell. Please you, name the trial You would have me make. Ges. You look upon your boy As though instinctively you guess'd it. Tell. Look Upon my boy!âWhat mean you? Look upon My boy as though I guess'd it!âGuess'd the trial You would have me make! Guess'd it, instinctively! Instinctively! You do not mean?âNo!âNo!â You would not have me make a trial of My skill upon my child! Impossible! I do not guess your meaning. Ges. I would see Thee hit an apple at the distance of A hundred paces. Tell. Is my boy to hold it? Ges. No. Tell. No!âI'll send the arrow through the core! Ges. It is to rest upon his head. Tell. O, Nature! Thou hear'st him! Ges. Thou dost hear the choice I giveâ Such trial of the skill, thou'rt master of, Or death to both of you, not otherwise To be escaped. Tell. Oh, monster! Ges. Wilt thou do it? Alb. He will! he will! Tell. Ferocious monster! Make A father murder his own child! Ges. Take off His chains, if he consents. Tell. With his own hand! Ges. Does he consent? Alb. He does. [Gesler signs to his Officers, who proceed to take off Tell's chains, Tell all the while unconscious of what they do. Tell. With his own hand!â Murder his child with his own hand! The hand I've led him, when an infant, by! 'Tis beyond horrorâ'Tis most horrible! Amazement!â'Tis too much for flesh and blood To bear!âI should be made of steel to stand it! And I believe I am, almost, about To turn to some such thing; for feeling grows Benumb'd within me, that I seem to lose Almost the power of hating him, and all's A calm, where all, but now, was raging tempest! [His chains, which they have been employed in unloosing, fall off. What!âDo you make me ready, while I wist not? [Lifts the manacles from the ground, and holds them to the soldiers. Villains! put on my chains again. My hands Are free from blood! and have no gust for it, That they would drink my child's!âHere!âHere!âI'll not Murder my boy for Gesler! Alb. FatherâFather! You will not hit me, father! Tell. Hit thee!âSend The arrow through thy brain!âor, missing that, Shoot out an eye!âor, if thine eye escapes, Mangle the cheek I've seen thy mother's lips Cover with kisses!âHit thee!âHit a hair Of thee, and cleave thy mother's heart! Who's he That bids me do it!âShow him me,âthe monster! Make him perceptible unto my reason And heart! In vain my senses vouch for it! I hear he lives!âI see it!âbut it is A prodigy that nature can't believe! Ges. Dost thou consent? Tell. Give me my bow and quiver. Ges. For what? Tell. To shoot my boy! Alb. No, father! no, To save me!âYou'll be sure to hit the apple. Will you not save me, father? Tell. Lead me forth!â I'll make the trial! Alb. Thank you! Tell. Thank me!âDo You know for what?âI will not make the trial, To take him to his mother in my arms, And lay him down a corse before her! Ges. Then He dies this moment; and you, certainly, Murder the child, whose life you have a chance To save, and will not use it. Tell. WellâI'll do it: I'll make the trial. Alb. [Runs up to Tell and embraces him.] Father! Tell. [Putting Albert behind him.] Speak not to me! Let me not hear thy voice!âThou must be dumb: And so should all things be!âearth should be dumb! And heaven!âunless its thunders mutter'd at The deed, and sent a bolt to stop it! Give me My bow and quiver! Ges. When all's ready. Tell. Ready!â I must be calm, with such a mark to hit! [Albert is about to take Tell's hand. Don't touch me, child!âDon't speak to me!âLead on! [Tell suddenly stops. Ges. Why do you stop? Tell. We have forgot!â'Tis dusk! Look at that mountain-peak! The sun is down To all belowâwill soon be down to that! You wish to see a trial of my skill, You ask for one, harder a thousand times Than e'er the hardest, yet, I e'er essay'd! You would not have me shoot, without my eyes? 'Twere just the same to shoot, without the light! The peak, you see, is now gone out!âThe court's To reachâThe ground 's to chooseâThe distance Has to be measured. Then, the boy's to place, The mark to be adjustedâWhere is it? Where is the apple!âEre all's ready, 'twill Be night. As well expect me, were I dead, To draw a bow, as now!âTo-morrow, Gesler. Ges. Hadst thou not linger'd!â Tell. It were doneâI know It shall be done to-morrow, wilt thou grant The time?â'Tis night already! Ges. Well!âTo-morrow! Take them to separate dungeons! Tell. To the same! He's but a child!âHe has his part to play! I would prepare him for it!âIt may be His last night. Let him spend it with his father! Ges. To the same dungeon! Tell. Now, my child, thy hand! [They go out severally. SCENE II. âSupposed to be in the Vicinity of the Castle. Enter Waldman and Michael. Wal. I sore mistrust thee, Michael! If thou play'st The trifler with me nowâ Mic. Dear father, fear not. Wal. But I do fear thee, boy; and, if not thee, I fear this stormy night. Dost hear the thunder? Mic. I do; but it is distant. Wal. There again! Mic. It sounds in the direction of the lake. Wal. Why hast thou brought me hither? Mic. Worthy sire, Thou said'st I ne'er would marry till my teeth Were gone. To show thee, to thy heart's content, The prophecy was wrong, I've brought thee hither To play her escort to my gentle bride, Whom thou shalt see anon. Wal. He's past all hope! Am I thy butt to play a jest upon? Is this a place to jest? Mic. No place more safe; No sentinel is here to mar a jest, Were I disposed for one. Wal. The storm comes on. Wouldst hold me here to bide its pelting? Mic. Hush! Dear father, hush, unless you'd spoil my wedding, And mar the only chance of making me A sober man. And, look, my bridesmen come. Enter Jagheli, with Theodore, and a band of Young Men, with a rope-ladder. Mic. Welcome, Jagheli! Father, my chief man, Who means to take example by your sonâ Marry a wife, and ever after live The gravest man in Altorf. Wal. Let me see Thy bride, and I'll believe thou mean'st to wed. It cannot be! There's not a man in Altorf Would take thee for his son-in-law! Mic. No man In Altorf shall call me his son-in-law. Wal. Where wilt thou get thy bride, then? Mic. Thou shalt see. Ha! there's the lightâJagheli, that's the casement! Come on! Friends, stay you here. And, father, pray Command your patience, till I give you proof, Such as shall full content you, that I mean With all my heart to be a sober man. [Michael and Jagheli go out with the rope-ladder. Wal. Friends, can you help me to a clue to find This riddle out? The. We're sworn to secrecy, And may not answer you. Wal. I seeâI seeâ He's not content to make a jest of me, But brings his friends to join him in the laugh! He wed!âHe take a wife!âHe'll bring some boy, Dress'd in his sister's gown and tucker, with His voice upon the crackâto pass him off For 's bride upon me. I'll begone, and balk [More thunder. His most irreverent humour! Friends, adieu! I give you joy of this fair sport. [Going. Enter Michael and AgnesâJagheli and Anneli. Mic. Sweet love, Fear not! I'll give thee to safe warding, till I take thee to mine own. Fair Anneli, Go with thy cousin. Father, to thy care We trust these jewels, that shall keep us rich For life! Don't wonder, SweetâThere's not a care This day may cost thee, but each after-day Shall bring as many golden joys as hours To pay thee for. Ann. I trust they mean us honest! Wal. A woman, as I live! Agn. Honest or not, No matter now, dear coz; our fortune's toldâ We're caught! Wal. A woman, too. Mic. By hands so kind!â So loving in their tendance on their prize, You'd not exchange captivity for freedom. Agn. Don't try us! Mic. Not unless you choose. Ann. Dear coz! Let us go back. Agn. Nay, coz, we'll e'en go on. These gallants trusted once, to trust them on, They say, is sometimes to secure the debt. Wal. Fair lady, I will be his bail, to see Due payment madeâif you will trust to me. Mic. Dear father, when you hear me jest again, You'll drink your grandson's health that is to be, And pardon me for him.âAway!âAway! These heads demand a kinder canopy Than this rough sky affords. Wal. Go you not with us? Mic. No; our brides forbid. Nor may we see them till we bring the priest To visit them to-morrow; and, besides, We've comrades here, bright gallants, as ourselves Were once, of whom we'd take a handsome leave. This hour, that parts us thus, we'll soon forgive, For the fair fellows that shall follow it. Good nightâSound sleepâSweet dreamsâgood nightâgood nightâ [Waldman, Agnes, and Anneli go out. Now, friends, the casement! There the ladder hangs; Climb fast, but silently. The chamber on The postern opens, and is lock'd, within. Thence we can watch the motions of our friends, And at the moment lend our sudden aid, When most it may avail.âOnâOn and up! [Young Men go out. Now, Michael, here's the closing of thy jests, Or making of thee!âFortune hold thy friend, There's not a sober man in Altorf but To own thy brows, would wear the cap and bells! [Goes out.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âTell's Cottage.âMelchtal asleep upon a couch, at the head of which Emma is watching. Emma [rising, and coming forward]. I never knew a weary night before! I have seen the sun a dozen times go down, And still no William,âand the storm was on; Yet have I laid me down, in peace, to sleep, The mountain with the lightning all a-blaze, And shaking with the thunder,âbut, to-night, Mine eyes refuse to close! The old man rests. Pain hath outworn itself, and turn'd to ease. How deathly calm's the night! What's that? I'm grown An idiot with my fears. I do not know The avalanche! Great Power that hurls it down, Watch o'er my boy, and guide his little steps! What keeps him? 'Tis but four hours' journey, hence; He'd rest; then four hours back again. What keeps him? Erni would sure be found by himâHe knows The track, well as he knows the road to Altorf! Mel. Help! [In his sleep. Emma. What's the matter! Only the old man dreaming. He thinks again they're pulling out his eyes. I'm sick with terror! Merciful powers! what's this That fills my heart with horrible alarm, And yet it cannot see! Mel. [Waking.] Where am I? Emma. Father! Mel. My daughter, is it thou? Thank heaven, I'm here. Is't day yet? Emma. No. Mel. Is't far on the night? Emma. Methinks, about the turn on't. Mel. Is the boy Come back? Emma. No, father. Mel. Nor thy husband? Emma. No. Mel. A woful wife and mother have I made thee! Would thou hadst never seen me. Emma. Father! Mel. Child? Emma. Methinks I hear a step!âI do! [Knocking.] A knock! Mel. 'Tis William! Emma. No, it is not William's knock. [Opens the door. I told you so! Your will? Enter Stranger. Stran. Seeing a light, I e'en made bold to knock, to ask for shelter, For I have miss'd my way. Emma. Whence come you, friend? Stran. From Altorf. Emma. Altorf!âAny news from thence? Stran. Ay! News to harrow parents' hearts, and make The barren bless themselves that they are childless! Emma. May heaven preserve my boy! Mel. What says thy news? Stran. Art thou not Melchtalâhe whose eyes 'tis said The tyrant has torn out? Mel. Yes, friend, the same. Stran. Is this thy cottage? Mel. No; 'tis William Tell's. Stran. 'Tis William Tell's!âAnd that's his wife!âGood night. Emma. [Rushing between him and the door.] Thou stirr'st not hence until thy news be told! Stran. My news? In sooth 'tis nothing thou wouldst heed. Emma. 'Tis something none should heed so well as I! Stran. I must be gone. Emma. Thou seest a tigress, friend, Spoil'd of her mate and young, and yearning for them. Don't thwart her! Come, thy news! What fear'st thou, man; What more has she to dread, who reads thy looks, And knows the most has come. Thy news? Is't bondage? Stran. It is. Emma. Thank heaven it is not death. Of oneâ Or two? Stran. Of two. Emma. A father and a son? Is't not? Stran. It is. Emma. My husband and my son Are in the tyrant's power! There's worse than that! What's that, is news to harrow parents' breasts, The which the thought to only tell, 'twould seem, Drives back the blood to thine?âThy news, I say! Wouldst thou be merciful, this is not mercy! Wast thou the mark, friend, of the bowman's aim, Wouldst thou not have the fatal arrow speed, Rather than watch it hanging in the string? Thou'lt drive me mad! Let fly at once!â Mel. Thy news from Altorf, friend, whate'er it is! Stran. To save himself and child from certain death, Tell is to hit an apple resting on The stripling's head. Mel. My child! my child!â Speak to me!âStranger, hast thou kill'd her? Emma. No! No, father. I'm the wife of William Tell; Oh but to be a man! to have an arm To fit a heart bursting with the sense of wrong! Unnaturalâinsufferable wrong! When makes the tyrant trial of his skill? Stran. To-morrow. Emma. Spirit of the lake and hill, Inspire thy daughter! On the head of him Who makes his pastime of a mother's pangs, Launch down thy vengeance by a mother's hand. Know'st the signal when the hills shall rise? [To Melchtal. Mel. Are they to rise? Emma. I see thou knowest naught. Stran. Something's on foot! 'Twas only yesterday That, travelling from our canton, I espied, Slow toiling up a steep, a mountaineer Of brawny limb, upon his back a load Of fagots bound. Curious to see what end Was worthy of such labour, after him I took the cliff: and saw its lofty top Receive his load, which went but to augment A pile of many another. Emma. 'Tis by fire! Fire is the signal for the hills to riseâ [Rushes out. Mel. Went she not forth? Stran. She didâshe's here again And brings with her a lighted brand. Mel. My child, What dost thou with a lighted brand? Re-enter Emma, with a brand. Emma. Prepare To give the signal for the hills to rise! Mel. Where are the fagots, child, for such a blaze? Emma. I'll find the fagots, father. [Exit. Mel. Is she gone Again? Stran. She isâI think into her chamber. Emma. [Rushing in.] Father, the pile is fired! Mel. What pile, my child? Emma. The joists and rafters of our cottage, father! Mel. Thou hast not fired thy cottage!âbut thou hast! Alas, I hear the crackling of the flames! Emma. Say'st thou alas! when I could say, thank heaven? Father, this blaze will set the land a-blaze With fire that shall preserve, and not destroy it, Blaze on! blaze on! Oh, mayst thou be a beacon To light its sons enslaved to liberty! How fast it spreads! A spirit's in the fire; It knows the work it does. [Goes to the door, and opens it The land is free! Yonder's another blaze. Beyond that shoots Another up!âAnon will every hill Redden with vengeance. Father, come! Whate'er Betides us, worse we're certain can't befal, And better may! Oh, be it libertyâ Safe hearths and homes, husbands and children. Comeâ It spreads apace. Blaze onâblaze onâblaze on! [Exeunt. SCENE THE LAST. âWithout the Castle. Enter, slowly, several Citizens, as if observing something following them, Verner, and Theodore. Ver. The pace they're moving at is that of men About to do the work of death. Some wretch Is doom'd to suffer. Should it be my friendâ Should it be Tell! The. No doubt 'tis some good man. Ver. Poor Switzerland! poor country! Not a son Is left thee now, that's worth the name of one. 'Tis not a common man, with such parade, They lead to death. I count four castellains Already. The. There's a fifth. Ver. And Sarnem, too! Do you see him? The. Yes: and Gesler follows him. Who can it be? Ver. We'll see. He's coming, nowâ 'Tis William Tell! The. Verner, do you know the boy That follows him? Ver. A boy! It is his son! What horror 's to be acted? Do you see The headsman? The. No! I see no headsman there, No apparatus for the work of death. Perhaps they're not to suffer! Ver. Lo you how The women clasp their hands, and now and then Look up to heaven! You see that some do weep. No headsman 's there; but Gesler 's at no loss For means of cruelty because there lacks A headsman! Enter Pierre. Pie. Horrible!âmost horrible Decree!âTo save his own and Albert's life, Tell is to hit an apple resting on The head of his own child! Enter, slowly, Burghers and Women, Lutold, Rodolph, Gerard, Sarnem, Gesler, Tell, Albert, and a Soldier bearing Tell's bow and quiverâanother with a basket of applesâSoldiers, &amp;c. Ges. That is your ground. Now shall they measure, thence A hundred paces. Take the distance. Tell. Is The line a true one? Ges. True or not, what is't To thee? Tell. What is't to me? A little thing, A very little thingâA yard or two, Is nothing here or thereâwere it a wolf I shot at! Never mind! Ges. Be thankful, slave, Our grace accords thee life on any terms. Tell. I will be thankful, Gesler! Villain, stop! You measure to the sun. Ges. And what of that? What matter, whether to or from the sun? Tell. I'd have it at my back!âThe sun should shine Upon the mark, and not on him that shoots. I cannot see to shoot against the sun!â I will not shoot against the sun! Ges. Give him his way!âThou hast cause to bless my mercy. Tell. I shall remember it. I'd like to see The apple I'm to shoot at. Soldier [with the basket of apples]. Here! Ges. Show me The basket!âThereâ Tell. You've pick'd the smallest one. Ges. I know I have. Tell. O! do you?âBut you see The colour on't is darkâI'd have it light, To see it better. Ges. Take it as it is: Thy skill will be the greater if thou hitt'st it. Tell. True!âTrue!âI didn't think of thatâI wonder I did not think of that.âGive me some chance To save my boy! I will not murder him If I can help itâfor the honour of The form thou wear'st, if all the heart be gone. Ges. Well! choose thyself. [Hands a basket of apples.âTell takes one. Tell. Have I a friend among The lookers on? Ver. Here, Tell! Tell. I thank thee, Verner! He is a friend that does not mind a storm To shake a hand with us! I must be brief. When once the bow is drawn, we cannot take The shot too soon! Verner, whatever be The issue of this hour, the common cause Must not stand still! Let not to-morrow's sun Set on the tyrant's banner.âVerner! Verner! The boy!âthe boy!âThink'st thou he has the courage To stand it? Ver. Yes. Tell. Does he tremble? Ver. No. Tell. Art sure? Ver. I am. Tell. How looks he? Ver. Clear and smilingly. If you doubt itâlook yourself. Tell. Noânoâmy friend, To hear it is enough! Ver. He bears himself So much above his yearsâ Tell. I know!âI know. Ver. With constancy so modestâ Tell. I was sure He wouldâ Ver. And looks with such relying love And reverence upon you Tell. Man! Man! Man! No more! Already I'm too much the father To act the man!âVerner, no more, my friend! I would be flintâflintâflint! Don't make me feel I'm notâYou do not mind me!âTake the boy And set him, Verner, with his back to me.â Set him upon his kneesâand place the apple Upon his head, so that the stem may front meâ Thus, VernerâCharge him to keep steadyâTell him I'll hit the apple!âVerner, do all this More briefly than I tell it thee. Ver. Come, Albert! Alb. May I not speak with him before I go? Ver. Noâ Alb. I would only kiss his hand. Ver. You must not. Alb. I must!âI cannot go from him without! Ver. It is his will you should. Alb. His will, is it? I am content, thenâcome. Tell. My boy! [Holding out his arms to him. Alb. My father! [Running into Tell's arms. Tell. If thou canst bear it, should not I?âGo now, My sonâand keep in mind that I can shoot.â Go, boyâBe thou but steady, I shall hit The apple. [Kisses him.] Go!âGod bless thee!âGo!âMy bow! [Sarnem gives the bow. Thou wilt not fail thy master, wilt thou?âThou Hast never fail'd him yet, old servant.âNo! I'm sure of theeâI know thy honesty, Thou'rt stanch!âStanch!âI'd deserve to find thee treacherous, Could I suspect thee so. Come, I will stake My all upon thee! Let me see my quiver. Ges. Give him a single arrow. Tell. Do you shoot? Lut. I do. Tell. Is't so you pick an arrow, friend? The point, you see, is blunt, the feather jagg'd; That's all the use 'tis fit for. [Breaks it. Ges. Let him have Another. Tell. Why, 'tis better than the first, But yet not good enough for such an aim As I'm to take. 'Tis heavy in the shaft: I'll not shoot with it! [Throws it away.] Let me see my quiver. Bring it! 'tis not one arrow in a dozen I'd take to shoot with at a dove, much less A dove like that? What is't you fear? I'm but A naked man!âA wretched naked man! Your helpless thrall, alone in the midst of you, With every one of you a weapon in His hand. What can I do in such a strait With all the arrows in that quiver? Come, Will you give it me or not? Ges. It matters not. Show him the quiver. You're resolved, I see, Nothing shall please you. [Tell kneels and picks out an arrow, which he hides under his vest, and then selects another. Tell. Am I so?âThat's strange, That's very strange!âIs the boy ready? Ver. Yes. Tell. I'm ready too!âKeep silence, every one! And stir not for my child's sake!âAnd let me have Your prayersâyour prayersâand be my witnesses, That if his life's in peril from my hand, 'Tis only for the chance of saving it! Now, friends, for mercy's sake keep motionless And silent. [Tell shoots, and a shout of wonder and exultation bursts from the crowd. Tell falls on his knees and with difficulty supports himself. Ver. [Rushing in with Albert.] Thy boy is safe; no hair of him is touch'd! Alb. Father, I'm safeâyour Albert's safe. Dear father, Speak to me! speak to me! Ver. He cannot, boy! Alb. You grant him life? Ges. I do. Alb. And we are free? Ges. You are. Alb. Thank Heaven! thank Heaven! Ver. Open his vest, And give him air. [Albert opens his father's vest, and an arrow dropsâ Tell starts, fixes his eyes on Albert, and clasps him to his breast. Tell. My boy! my boy! Ges. For what Hid you that arrow in your breast? Speak, slave! Ver. He cannot!âHe's o'ercome! [Whispers to Tell. William, the tyrant stands aloof from all! Thy deadly aim, alone, transfixes him, And with him all the rest, through fear for him; While pace by pace thou canst withdraw;âBut gain A dozen yards, thou'rt free! I'll mind the boy! Ges. How came that arrow in thy breast? Speak, slave! Tell. To kill thee, tyrant, had I slain my son! And now beware! [Tell suddenly takes aim at Gesler. Stir thou, or any, stir! The shaft is in thy heart! [Tell retreats slowly, while Verner removes Albert. Gesler and the rest, following Tell with their eyes, remain in breathless and motionless suspense. Sar. He shoots! Ges. O! [Falls dead, transfixed with the arrow. Sar. Pursue him!âHold! A host of friends have join'd him, And all in arms!âThey now advance! Lut. On this side Another speeds! Sar. Back to the castle! Lut. Look! [Michael and his friends appear on the ramparts. The castle is betray'd! Mic. We thank you, friends, For changing quarters with us! Sar. Ha!âShut out! Surrounded! [Enter on one side, Swiss, led by Tell, &amp;c., and on the other, Emma, followed by Swiss, led by Erni. Tell. Yield! Resistance now is hopeless! Your lives are spared!âThe tyrant's will suffice! Emma, your child! We are free, my countrymen! Our country is free! Austrians, you'll quit a land, You never had a right to; and remember, The country's never lost, that's left a son To struggle with the foe that would enslave her! END OF WILLIAM TELL.</field>
