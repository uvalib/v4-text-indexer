      <field name="fulltext">ALFRED THE GREAT: OR, THE MINSTREL KING. An Historical Extravaganza.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SAXONS. ALFRED THE GREAT (the Minstrel King of England: author of Trial by Jury, the Candleclock, &amp;c., and translator of the Works of Boethius and Paulus Orosius: so old and dear a friend, that we may safely venture on a few harmless jokes at his expense) Mr. F. Robson. OSWITH (his Aide-de-camp, who, as a portion of his duties, aids His Majesty in decamping; an English Officer in the Blues; a pure Saxon, but a remarkably true Briton notwithstanding) Miss Herbert. EDRIC (an unfavourable view of the Anglo-Saxon character; a Thane of the highest rank and birth, but who, nevertheless, unites in his own person the basest attributes of the Churl and the Villein) Mrs. W. S. Emden. ODDUNE (Earl of Devon: a very fine specimen of the Old English Gentleman; Commander-in-Chief of the British Army during King Alfred's retirement) Mr. F. Vining. CEOLWULF (a Renegade from the Saxon cause, described in Pauli's Alfred the Great as a “weak-minded Thane of the exiled King's;” but whose corporeal attributes will be found liable to no objection whatever) Miss Cottrell. DUNULF (corrupted into Dunup, a not particularly Neat-herd, and a by no means Fancy Baker; a Striking Example of the unsettled state of the times) Mr. Horace Wigan N. B.—This historical personage is reported by William of Malmesbury to have been educated by King Alfred subsequently to the events of our Drama, and elevated to the dignity of Bishop of Winchester, At the time of our making his acquaintance he gets his living more by hook than by crook—while the idea of such a subject having ever been dipped into a See, looks improbable on the face of it. HEADRED (a Hind—who, as he will have some up-hill work in the piece, may also be described as a Panter) Mr. H. Cooper. ELSWITH (an Heiress, by no means apparent; Daughter of Ethelred Mucel, Earl of the Gaini, and betrothed to King Alfred, but quite unable to find her match) Miss E. Nelson. MAUDE (The Neatherd's Wife of our earliest infantile recollections; supposed Authoress of the celebrated Legend, “Pat-a-Cake, Pat-a-Cake, Baker's man;” believed also, from her having been the first Baker and the first great Rebel in English history, to have been an early Member of the Crumb-well family) Miss Stephens. SAXON AUXILIARIES. MERLIN (the Old English Enchanter—by the kind permission of Alfred Tennyson, Esq., L. L. D., Poet-Laureate, &amp;c., &amp;c.) Mr. H. Rivers. THE APPARITION OF A GOVERNMENT CLERK Mrs. Charlton. THE APPARITION OF AN ARMED RIFLEMAN Mr. James. THE APPARITION OF A NAVAL VOLUNTEER Miss Charles. DANES. GUTHRUM (Leader of the Danish Forces—“He was by far the most powerful Viking who had yet appeared in England,” Pauli: a singular paradox, a man who is constantly finding whatever he wants, but who, nevertheless, has always to be a Sea-king for it; a northern Chieftain, who, having been frost-bitten from his childhood, is naturally an enthusiastic worshipper of Thor) Mr. G. Cooke. HALDANE (a Viking of a single size smaller) Mr. F. Charles. OTHO (a Viking of the Class Letter C, No. 3, officiating, among other duties, as Priest of Odin) Mr. Franks. INA (the Sea King's Daughter) Miss Hughes. Chieftains, Warriors, Attendants, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. N.B.—Passages enclosed in inverted commas may be omitted in representation. —The Danish Camp in Wessex. English Coast Scenery. Ina and Elswith (disguised as a waiting maid), R., shooting at a stuffed figure in Lincoln Green, R. Elswith. (L.—offers an arrow) One more! Ina. (L. C.) 'Tis waste of time! yet have your will— (misses again) I told you so, the Green Man's there— Elswith. And still! Yet don't be beaten—patience wins the game. Ina. The ground's too much up hill! I've lost my aim— Some bows won't bend—the man's beyond my reach. Elswith. I see your highness I shall never teach To draw the long bow. Come, you pretty dunce! Out with the truth you're burning with at once. Ina. Since to conceal it seems a fruitless trouble, Edith, my words conveyed a meaning double, In saying I'd no aim—I meant in life— And as for the Green Man— Elswith. He wants a wife! Ina. (hiding her face, embracing Elswith) He hasn't said so yet. Elswith. For want, no doubt, Of fair encouragement—we'll draw him out. Proceed! Ina. Ahem! 'Tis now some three months since, Guthrum, my Danish sire—the noblest Prince Of Odin's free and independent race— Elswith. (curtly) More free than welcome here! Ina. How! to my face? Elswith. Oh, madam, no offence—the words would pop; It's in my blood—of which, though ev'ry drop For you I'd gladly shed at any hour, Not half an ounce of it have I the power To change in quality— Ina. Explain! Elswith. It's English! A sort that at Invasion's name grows tinglish— Flushes the cheeks—lights fire within the eyes. (grasping Ina's wrist in her excitement) Ina. (shrinking alarmed) Cowardly girl! Hit one of your own size! Elswith. (calming herself) Forgive me, madam, just a passing weakness. Ina. Then please be strong again! All smiles and meekness, Who could have thought 'twas in the girl? Elswith. That's it! You foreigners can't make us out a bit, We stand so much in the insulting line, You don't believe we can kick up a shine. But when provoked at last—we prove so strong— Hit out so hard—and keep it up so long, In spite of num'rous odds and armed disparity— Hem! Hence our Continental popularity! Song—“The Island Home of an Englishman.” There is a stain on the English fame, (Though it seems but a beauty spot To the eyes of friends,)—which our foes proclaim As a most unsightly blot. 'Tis that the English troops—when the foeman swoops On their lines with numbers vast; And they ought to feel whack'd—to acknowledge the fact Will refuse to the very last. 'Tis an obstinate habit, deny it who can? But you can't knock it out of an Englishman! (a triumphal march heard faintly, R., in which the bagpipes predominate—Ina listens eagerly) Ina. (R. C.) Hush! Elswith. (L. C.) What alarms your highness? Ina. Silence, do! Dinna ye hear them? Elswith. What? Ina. They're coming! Elswith. Who? The Campbells? Ina. No—the Danes. They've won a battle! What, if among the luggage or the cattle They've captured him? Elswith. Him!—who? Ina. (wildly) How should I know? As if he'd ever told his love! Elswith. (aside) Oho! Ina. I shall go mad! Elswith. Calm your excited brains! Ina. What! think you Guthrum's are St. Clement's Danes, That any mercy will to him be shewn? (crosses, L.) My gallant what's his name!—my loved unknown! Fly!—bribe his captors—warn him of his danger! (music stops) Elswith. (R.) Really—the gentleman's a perfect stranger! Ina. (L.) True, true!—I will be calm, though it's distressing. Listen! Elswith. They've stopped the bagpipes—that's one blessing! Song.—Ina.—Air, “Old English Gentleman.” You recollect the form, of course—to say you don't's no use— Of that fine young English officer who brought the flag of truce? With stiff moustache and whiskers hanging down like streamers loose— Who scarcely spoke two words, except “Good gwacious!” and “The dooce!” Like a fine young English officer, One of the Coldstream kind! When Guthrum, fierce, with angry words, attempted him to awe, He merely stroked his whiskers with the observation, “Haw!” When threaten'd death he bared his neck, exclaiming—“Trifling! Baw!” Slight indications marking the—in fact—“Je ne sais quoi” Of a fine young English Officer, One of the Coldstream kind. And now conceive the horrid fear that rends my heart in twain, That this fine young English Officer should captive be, or slain; Or—excuse my broken English when in anguish I explain— If with scorn dat Saxon treats me, its all over with dis Dane. Through that fine young English Officer, One of the Coldstream kind. Exeunt, L., Elswith supporting Ina. March resumed, off, R., louder. Enter Guthrum, Haldane, Oscar, and other Danes, in triumph, R. U. E., preceded by Banner Bearer; Guthrum strikes the Archery Dummy out, R. 2 E., as he enters. Guth. Here plant our Rafen Standard, ere we sup, It's not yet paid for—therefore stick it up. (the standard is planted, C.) Well, Sons of Odin! By this victory We've liberated England thoroughly— Freed her from Dover's Straits to Scotland's Borders, Yet somehow, we get looked on as—marauders. And spite the purity of our intention, Folks don't appreciate our intervention. Nor think that all our sieges, broils, and battles, Were undertaken for their goods—and chattels. All's one—we here commence a three week's fête, This crowning victory, to celebrate That leaves us England's lords, and nothing but— Where's her King Alfred? Echo answers—“cut!” For hips and haws about the hedge-rows dodging, And literally up a tree for lodging. Now, folks don't live up trees—not forced to use 'em; And few pick hips and haws because they choose 'em. A monarch so decidedly hard up, Can't keep a crown. What, ho! the Norseman's cup! Exit Officer, R. To drink to him whose name for the succession, Stands next in alphabetical progression. Hald. (R.) How alphabetically—great chieftain, say! G comes not usually after A? Guth. (thoughtfully) That's true! Yet we can square it to our liking. Alfred's an ex-king—Guthrum is a wi-king! The Hirlas Horn (which is a large drinking horn) is brought in from R., he takes a prolonged draught. Female Attendants enter, and hand round drinking cups to Soldiers, during the following Song—Haldane—Air, “Libiamo,” from “La Traviata.” The horn! Let us drink from the Hirlas horn, 'Tis the true tonic cup for the Norseman born. The horn! For the warrior on battle-fields worn, Here are hartshorn and oil both in one. When round the ships of Norse or Finking, Waves dash, and lightning's fierce are blinking, And the Sea King feels a kind of sin-king, As his stock of spirits gets outrun. The horn! Just a draught from the Hirlas horn Enables him tempests to laugh to scorn. The horn! of true courage, the source and the bourne, Whether Danish or Dutch 'tis all one. (during this, Guthrum sits on stone seat, C., and applies himself constantly to the Hirlas horn) At end of song an Officer enters, R. U. E., bringing in “a yard-and-a-half of songs.” Guth. (C., rising) What now? Officer. (who has crossed to L.) In Saxon Alfred's empty tent, We found this paper. Guth. Hand the document. Officer gives paper and exit, L. (reads with difficulty) “Poems, by Alfred Rex, Fid-Def, et cetera;” The weak invention of a poor black letterer. Can authors fight? Goes victory with anyone Whose line of battle at the best's a penny one? “Yet stay, important vict'ries have been won Through Reüter's agency, by words alone.” (tears up paper) Declined with thanks—we can't return bad writing; Somebody think of something more exciting. Hald. (R.) The sacrifice of victims— Guth. We'd forgot. That's better; call us when the stakes are hot! (goes up, C.—noise of chains, L. 1 E.) Now, what's all this? Enter Oswith and Edric, loaded with chains—Otho trying to prevent their entrace, L. 1 E. Oswith. (L. C.) Your pardon, warlike Dane, For this intrusion. Edric. (L.) Pray, let me explain! Oswith. Then simply, this man's mad. Edric. Oh, he's a fool! Guth. (C.—drinking) That both are right, we feel a strong suspicion; Yet clouds affect our cerebral condition. It may be from our warlike deeds this morn, Or copious reference to the Hirlas horn. What are ye, fellows? Oswith. (proudly) I myself, avow, An officer and gentleman. Guth. And thou? Edric. (abjectly) Merely an officer! Guth. (C.) In reg'ments crack? Oswith. (L. C.) The Horse Guards Blue. Guth. And yours? Edric. (L.) The Foot Guards Black. Guth. Your names? Oswith. Mine's Oswith. Edric. Edric's mine. Guth. (smiling foggily) No! is it? Gentleman, both,—the honor of this visit— Something beyond what I could have presumed— Hald. (R.—correcting him) Sire, these are captives, both to Odin doomed. Guth. How now! Is Guthrum schooled and contradicted? Prisoners at the bar—you stand convicted— No, that's not it. Our drinking cups replenish. (to Oswith and Edric, amiably) Though, if you'd rather light Bourdeaux or Rhenish— Haldane, my friend, just watch this case for us, We don't feel quite the thing. (sits and slumbers) Hald. (to Otho) Now, what's the fuss? Otho. (up, L. C.) In drawing lots for Odin's sacrifice, We drew this baddish lot—at any price. (Edric) Out for the altar we in robes had trick'd him, When this man volunteers to save the victim— Edric. Who in my place, without of fear of particle, Offers himself— Oswith. As a superior article! Edric. I'm one these trying times upset most sadly; In battles I'm no use—I run so badly. To forge a signature, I've scarce the skill, And haven't strength to take up e'en a bill. My life's all kicks—no halfpence—thorns, not clover; I wish you'd just light up and get it over! Hald. (R., to Oswith) See you in life no beauties? Oswith. (L. C.) Well, not many! (eyeing them all around) As placed at present—I may say—not any. The air of Continental revolution I fear won't suit my British Constitution. I'm sure we shan't agree in any case, So, to save trouble, grill me in his place; I feel that I shall do you far more credit, Also the service—verbum sap—I've said it! (goes up, L. C.) Edric. (aside) He'll beat me yet! He always did at school! (goes up, L.) Hald. (shaking Guthrum) Chief! we await your sentence! Guth. (asleep) Take a rule! Re-enter Ina, L. 1 E. Ina. (aside) Tishe! Oswith. (up, L. C., seeing her) By Jove! What heavenly vision's yonder? Edric. (up L.—struck also with her beauty) Good gracious! there's a girl! Another blunder! Now I'm in love—and want to keep alive! Ina. (aside) Pray Heaven, to save him I in time arrive! (coming towards C.—the Danes make way for her) Otho. (R., to Guthrum) My liege! the Princess Ina! Guth. Eh! what's brought her? (starts up and embraces her) My angel twins!—I mean my single daughter— Affection dims our eyesight. Ina. (clinging to him) From the fight Returned in safety? Guth. Right, my love—and tight! Ina. (rapturously) And this my birth-day! Guth. So it is, my dear, Which makes you in your thirty-seventh year! Ina. (L. C.) What! I? Just turned eighteen! Guth. (R. C.) True! Care and trouble. Makes your afflicted pa see all things double But we remember, if things turned out pleasant, Out of the spoil we promised you a present. Ina. Forgotton in the joy of seeing you. Guth. What's it to be? Ina. (assuming carelessness) Oh! anything will do— That slave for instance (pointing to Oswith) pretending to despise you. Guth. He's yours! Remove his chains! (Otho moves to do so) Oswith. (calmly) Shouldn't advise you! These hands once free, might spoil some Danish feature By demonstrations of a British nature. (tucking up his cuffs—a movement on the part of the Danes) “Hand-cuffs removed might lead to fisty-cuffs! What are hands for but to slip into muffs?” Hald. (R.) His life is forfeit! He insults the Dane! Guth. (To Edric, mistaking identity) Villain! thy life is forfeit! (crossing to L. C.) Edric. (L.) Sold again! Ina. (R. C.) Nay! 'tis yon captive who insults you there, I would humiliate behind my chair, Would force to carry lap-dogs—parcels—books, The other one, more humble in his looks, From honorable death I would not save. Edric. (aside) Go it! Ina. The one that I would make my slave Is the proud upstart—not the harmless sappy. Guth. (maudlin, joins the hands of Oswith and Ina) Bless you my children! Take her and be happy! (The Danes look indignant) Hald. (R.) But Odin's sacrifice—to thus make light of it! Guth. Settle it as you please!—Let's make a night of it! Finale to Scene—“Puritani.” In non-operatic companies, this may be sung to the familiar melody of “Dusty Bob.” Hald. What is the odds, pray, so long as you are quite felicitous, We've come to England, and here we mean to stay; Alfred has vanished, and doesn't seem inclined to visit us, Under which circumstances, all we have to say, (spoken) Is— Chorus. Now then, my weary Danes, Come let's be cheery, Danes. Foot it, put it, trip it, keep it up till break of day. Rum tiddidy, rum tiddidy, &amp;c. Ina. (to Oswith) 'Twas but to save you, I framed my scheme of intervention, Oswith. I'm more in danger now, than from the stake or knife; Edric. All in connexion with the circumstance that I've to mention, (spoken) Is— I've no partner—no end—no aim in life! (Guthrum falls, C.) Chorus. Hald. Hold hard, my cheery Danes, Guthrum is weary, Danes, Bear him off to honour's bed, in Scandinavia's way! Rum tiddidy, rum tiddidy, &amp;c. (Guthrum is lifted on to a litter made by Soldiers, with their battle axes (or on a large shield), and is carried off, R., all following in procession—Oswith leading Ina, and Edric sneaking after them, his head drooping, and his chained hands behind him, guarded by Haldane)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE SECOND. —St. Neot's Well in Selwood Forest, on the road to the Danish Camp at Athelney; a drinking fountain in rock piece (C. flat), painted in rough imitation of those about the metropolis. The drinking cups have been removed—a placard above it. “G. R.—Closed for the winter, by Order of Government. Edric—Chief Commissioner.” A poster on a tree as follows:—“£1,000 reward. Left his throne,—Alfred of Wessex, commonly called Alfred the Great; any body giving information on the above head (leading to its removal from the adjacent shoulders), will find it of much removal from the adjacent shoulders), will find it of much greater use to anybody than the owner.” Sign boards in the enclosure. “Spring guns set here, and expected to grow to perfection before the summer.” “Deer stickers, beware!” “Anybody poaching eggs in these preserves, will be persecuted with the utmost regularity.” Music.—“A famous man was Robin Hood.” Enter Dunulf, L.—He is a rough-looking fellow, armed with cross bow, arrows, &amp;c., and carries a spiked bludgeon; he walks to and fro melodramatically, listening on the ground, then comes forward. Dun. To strike or not to strike, that was the problem; Whether to take up arms at once, and nobble 'em— Bring 'em to terms by violence and riot, Or sign the document and take things quiet? On sound reflection I've resolved myself To put the “Claims of Labour” on the shelf, And stick to capital—that is to say, Stick to as much of it as comes my way. My wife—of my late hours and ways in doubt, Like other angry masters—locks me out. But loss of home with grief need scarcely stifle one I've got my Club here—a little quiet Rifle one. Head. (without, R.) Dunulf! Ahoy! Dun. Hillo, ho, boys! hillo! Head. (entering, R. 1 E.) “First in the field as usual. Dun. Why, you know, Since to play William Tell, the plot we've nursed, It stands to reason, some one must be Furst.” No news of Alfred? Head. None; or very slight. I took his portrait, in my way, last night; The sight of it may drooping spirits freshen, You see, I've knocked off more than one impression. (pours guineas out of a bag) Dun. You are an artist—from the life! Head. Not quite, The gentleman I drew upon at sight For the amount. A Dane of goodly size, I left for rather dead than otherwise. Elswith. (without, L.) Dunulf, ahoy! Dun. Hillo, ho! lad, this way! It's that young dog that joined us yesterday! Enter Elswith, in a boy's forester's dress, with bow and arrows, knives, &amp;c., and carrying a quantity of newly killed game. Elswith. (handing game to Dunulf) Here! pray take these—a junior's contribution. Dun. You see, we're quite reduced to destitution. (winking at Headred) But what's the matter, lad, you seem in pain! Elswith. Oh! such a dreadful accident. Dunulf and Headred. Explain! Elswith. I'll try. Just now, when practising long shot At moving objects, it appears I'd got Close to the Danish lines. Dun. (C.) You daring monkey! Elswith. (L.) Oh, I was safe—hiding behind a donkey, As recommended by the Thane of Drummond. Well now, though all my self control, I'd summoned, (slily) My arrow slipped—by accident of course— And picked a Danish general off his horse. Dun. Dead? Elswith. I'm afraid so, by his limbs and features. Dun. (whimpering hypocritically) We're a poor set of unprotected creatures! Elswith. But how gets on our list? Dun. Slowly, i'feggs! You see, the uniform don't suit all legs, And men who'd fear no battle's knocks or noise, Would quail before a charge of London boys; “Still with the funds, they come down pretty stiff, And if we could but find King Alfred— Elswith. If! Dun. And get him to accept the presidency; They vow some sport our visitors should then see.” Elswith. In the meantime, our little plan is clear, The enemy to harass flank and rear; Watch his weak points, his movements supervise, And above all, to cut off his supplies. But there, get in—it's my turn as a sentry, To watch for the nobility and the gentry. Exeunt Dunulf and Headred, R. 1 E. Song.—Elswith.—Air, “'Twas rank and fame.” 'Twas rank and fame that tempted me, 'Twas empire gained my heart; King Alfred's bride engaged to be, Till Fortune made us part; The prize I fondly deemed my own, A blank has proved to be. And I am here, a spinster lone, Beneath the greenwood tree. Though highly bred and nobly born, To seek that swain of mine; You've seen me take, nor think it scorn, The maid of all-work line. To which pursuit I join the part, When from its duties free, Of highwayman and outlaw smart, Beneath the greenwood tree. Exit, R., after Dunulf and Headred. Music,—“The British Grenadiers,”—played very shrilly upon a fife, with drum accompaniment. Enter Oddune, (Earl of Devon), preceded by a Bombasteslike regiment of Saxon soldiers, very ragged and miserable. Oddune is a fine looking veteran, with a flowing beard, covered with ribbons, crosses, &amp;c., but very much dilapidated as to costume. Odd. Halt! but you're that already—ev'ry man Stand—well at ease, as nearly as you can. Eyes right—you find that easier—do you not? (aside) There's not a decent eye-left in the lot. Now—Order arms! No—don't—that's mere child's play for 'em, It's easy to say Order arms—who'd pay for 'em? Here comes a puppy! Enter Ceolwulf, a Saxon exquisite, carrying a paletot, small carpet bag, and a thin umbrella, L. 1 E. Ceol. (L.) Ha! my lord, you charm me! (Oddune shakes hands churlishly) Who are your gallant friends? Odd. (R.) (groaning) The British Army! Ceol. (inspecting troops through eye glass) No! Bless my soul! How very microscopic! What brought them down to this? Odd. It's a wide topic! “Peace-mongers throwing on our craft aspersion, And discontent resulting in desertion. Ceol. Desertion! Odd. Ah! too true—in vain we hid it— Between ourselves, in secret—the cat did it!” But never mind—a few reforms—though late— Will set us on our legs again quite straight. Ceol. (eyeing them through glass) I trust they may—for really—to be candid, It's high time some of you should be disbanded. Odd. Young man, you see those ragged soldiers— Ceol. Hem! Odd. Don't think too slightingly of even them, I've known a few such scare-crows ere to-day, Frighten whole flocks of Eagles, boy, away! Ceol. How charmingly antique, upon my word— Odd. Not coming my way, I suppose? Ceol. Absurd! Your ways, dear General, you must confess Are dreadfully old fashioned—eh? Odd. (R.) Well—yes! I'm still for Alfred—England—Home and Duty! Ceol. (L.) I'm for the new regime—Court life and beauty! Odd. (with disgust) Quick march, my lads! Of powder or of shot any, He is not worth—besides—we haven't got any! Music, “British Grenadiers.”—Exeunt Oddune and Soldiers, R. 1 E. Ceol. I'm glad the old bore's gone. I feel as though I'd just got safely out of Wombwell's Show! Each to his taste! He's with the Camp content, The Court is my congenial element. No matter who the regal sway assumes So that he gives us lots of drawing rooms. I think I shall surprise these simple Danes, By my success among the hoops and trains. Song.—Air, “Shadow Dance.” Ah, fair reflection, You've no objection To court inspection, Oh, no! I would not fly thee, But still stand by thee, For I defy thee To show My fair reflection, In earth's collection Of rare perfection A beau! For competition On exhibition, Ah! no! no! no! no! Re-enter Dunulf, Headred, Elswith, and other members of the corps, armed with bludgeons, &amp;c.—they surround Ceolwulf unobserved. Ceol. (C.) Yes, they shall view me with weak nerves astounded, By all that's lovely in the land surrounded, Quite at ease, enjoying my own way. Dun. (coming down L. C.) Fine evening, mate! no hurry! Ceol. (C., alarmed) Here! I say! What men are you? Dun. What men do we look like? We're Saxon labourers upon the strike. Ceol. (trying to smile, self assured) We should be friends, then—I'm a Saxon gent! Dun. Yes—but we hear you've signed the Document. Ceol. You would'nt think of robbing me? Dun. Rob you? Not for the world! But your subscription's due. Song.—Dunulf.—Air, “Yonder man in blue.” Oh, sir! Not so, sir? We would'nt come to go, sir, For to rob a Saxon gemman—not for twenty pund, But, sir—you'll put, sir, Your name before you cut, sir, Down for something handsome to our New Strike Fund. (they all surround Ceolwulf, and hustle him about stage—Elswith drags him off, L. 1 E., and the rest follow)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Third. —Neatherd's Cottage and Public Bakehouse; placards about, “Best bread down again”—“Hot rolls at 8”—“Bakings punctually attended to,” &amp;c. &amp;c.; an oven forward, L. Alfred discovered, as in Wilkie's picture, only with a baker's peel instead of a bow, L.; Maude making dough and watching him in his reverie, R. Alfred. (musing) Muffins! and monarchy! Oh! it's all right! Maude. Aye—there he sits—and would from morn till night. This comes of paying workmen by the hour! To see the time he wastes— Alfred. (as before, not heeding her) The choicest flower— Maude. Ah! much you know of that— Alfred. (as before) Of England's Army! Maude. Bring me that yeast— Alfred. (mechanically stirring some yeast) Why is the 'East called Barmy? Dawn brings no slumber to these eyes unwilling— Maude. You're a nice baker— Alfred. And the night-work's killing! All were not lost yet—by a desp'rate plunge In Guthrum's camp—if I could set a sponge, I might stir up a little fermentation And make bad bread between him and the nation. (Maude comes forward, looking at him astonished, Alfred continues not heeding her) What right has Guthrum, any more than I, To dip his finger in another's pie? (he mechanically suits the action to the word, with a large unbaked pie on the table—Maude aghast) Pies! (excited) If my time I o'er again could go! I'd cram the humblest down his throat—just so! (in his excitement, he crams a very small patty from a tray, into his mouth) Maude. (coming forward) Upon my word! Alfred. (aside) Oh! fatal dis-illusion! Madam! I'm all puff paste—I mean—confusion— But I'll make good the act that's roused your ire, I see, Of petty larceny—or patty pi-racy! Maude. (R.) You'll make it good? Alfred. (L.) Say that, I scarcely durst. It wasn't very good—to eat—at first. Maude. I told you to keep up a fire, you dunce! Alfred. (clutching her by the wrist) You should have seen the fire I kept up once— (Maude slightly alarmed) On Guthrum's troops! (checking himself) Back! back! incautious cat! You were observing— Maude. Yes! observing that— Look at the stove—half black—a pretty state! Alfred. (aside) Half black the stove, and I Alf-red the Grate! I shall betray myself. (to Maude) It will soon catch— That is, if I can only find my match. There! just observe me set the bellows going— Here we are—all a blowing—all a glowing! (sits on a stool, blowing fire) Duet, “A Life by the Galley Fire.” Alfred. A light at the oven fire I'll raise, if you won't get riled; The shock of a lady's ire Is not what suits this child. Maude. I am going a call to make; On the batch keep watchful eyes, Or you'll find, if I don't mistake, There are crustier things than pies. (together) Alfred. I'll light up a roaring fire, Where an ox might whole be br'iled; The shock of a lady's ire Is not what suits this child. What suits, &amp;c. Maude. Look after the batch and fire; If there's anything burnt or sp'iled, Look out for disasters dire; You know what suits this child. What suits, &amp;c. Exit Maude, D. in flat.—Alfred, alone, puts on apron, &amp;c.. Alfred. Yes! to a monarch in my situation— The only policy is resignation. (proceeds to put different articles of pastry into the oven, in a business-like manner) Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which, like this currant bun, though hard and dry, And difficult to chew, howe'er you grind it, Is worth a plum, (inspects bun critically) if one could only find it! But now a king—now thus! But yesterday A mighty realm acknowledged Alfred's sway. A kingly diadem embraced this head. Now—how the gilt's come off that gingerbread! (looks at a piece of gingerbread) The poet's fame—the lover's joy were mine. My last flirtation with the tuneful Nine Sold six impressions—gratis copies none of them! How the press buttered it! (sees a piece of paper under some cakes on a tin) By Jove! here's one of them! (shoves it angrily aside) Yet my worst trial—my severest smart— Unfeeling Elswith—(looks at a small queen cake) what a small queen's heart!— Was thy desertion on our wedding day That should have been. In-doors how could I stay! The ruthless Danes were on us ten to one— I was obliged to make a Sally—Lunn. (action of peel) To think I'd sneaked away to save myself— To fly and leave that note upon the shelf, Whose withering words have dimmed my manhood's lustre. My heart! my heart! Down, palpitating buster! (falls, overcome by his feelings, on a large loaf on the table, and remains sobbing, R.) An old Beggar Man in rags, enters at back, and raps with a penny on the counter. Old M. Shop! Alfred. (not moving) Bother! Old M. Want-ed! Alfred. Call again! Eh! Stop! I'd best mind this—and sink my former shop. Let a gay mask conceal the pangs I suffer— (skips behind counter in a lively shop-boy style) What can I serve you with, respected buffer? (tosses different specimens of cakes, &amp;c., about the counter as he speaks) Anything in the plain or fancy line? Our brandy-snaps are thought extremely fine. Or let me strew some crackers in your path, A Chelsea bun—No? Then we'll go to Bath! Old M. (amused) I'faith, young man, you'd set one at one's ease, But these are not the times for luxuries. Alfred. Something in plain goods, eh? Then take your pick, (strewing small loaves on counter) Or let me for you—There's a jolly brick! Or go at once to twopence—don't be shabby, See—that's the famous roll of Battle Abbey! Old M. (laughing) Nay! nay! a white loaf's price would knock me down! Alfred. So poor as that? Then catch! (throws him a loaf) It's my last brown! But in your state of impecuniosity, (coming down) 'Tis yours free gratis. Old M. (changing his tone of voice) Kingly generosity! A deed that shall perpetuate your name, On Pinnock's highest Pinnac-le of fame; In letters of the purest gold designed, By history's own Goldsmith— Alfred. Now that's kind. Of course the circumstance need ne'er be known, That the presented loaf was not my own? Old M. A bagatelle! Alfred. Then may I beg to learn Who the small prophet is—this quick return That promises? Old M. With that I'll soon acquaint you. (crosses, R.) (chord—his disguise flies off; he appears as Merlin the Enchanter) Alfred. (L.) Oh! my prophetic soul! you're Zadkiel, arn't you? Merlin. Get out! I'm Merlin! Alfred. (incredulously) Merlin! stop a bit! Don't say a word, that might yourself commit— You're talking to King Alfred! Merlin. (R.) Well, I know him! Alfred. (L.) Then mind—I've read my next great namesake's poem, Which proved how naughty Vivian—fair as clever, Sent Merlin—ages back—to sleep for ever! Merlin. Alfred the Greater, listen. Butts of sherry And public praise, are apt to make folks merry; Your laureate did but joke—I'm wide awake, And a few incantations come to make. Have you a cauldron—just for half a minute? Alfred. (producing a cauldron from L.) Here's this! but we've been boiling alum in it! Merlin. The very thing! 'twill but improve the flavour! (Alfred places cauldron over trap, L.—Merlin waves his wand) Now, Spirits, just oblige me as a favour, Come high, or low—show in official shape! The Apparition of a small Government Clerk rises, with a huge piece of red tape in his hand. 1st Apparition. Al-fred! Al-fred! Al-fred! Beware red tape! Beware diplomacy and all such stuff; Dismiss me—on a pension, please—enough! (descends) Alfred. (R.) Whoe'er thou art, for this good caution, thanks! Merlin. (C.) Hold! let me raise another from the ranks! The Apparition of an armed Rifleman rises. 2nd App. Al-fred! Al-fred! Al-fred! Be firm and bold. Have any quantity of us enrolled; Don't snub us—but encourage us to arm, And none of woman born shall England harm! (descends) Alfred. Then, Guthrum, live! Of thee what need to fear! Still I don't want to have him living here. How from henceforth to keep invaders far— The Apparition of a small Sailor rises, with a model frigate on his head. What's this that rises with a smell of tar? And bears upon its baby forehead's tip, A model of the new Victoria ship? 3rd App. Be iron metall'd—screw propell'd—steel-plated, Take thou no care where plots are incubated; England shall never with invasion meet, So long as she keeps up a channel fleet! (descends) Alfred. Good gracious! If we'd thought of that before— Yet tell me one thing— Merlin. Seek to know no more! Taps Alfred on head with wand and disappears—the cauldron sinks. Alfred. Why sinks that cauldron? Is this all a joke? Where's the enchanter? And what's all this smoke? Have I been dreaming of the future learning? What could it mean? And what's this smell of burning? Methought I was a Scottish king—with vassals, Kernes, gallowglasses, gillies, duniewassels, Consulting witches at their midnight work Around a crackling fire—(sniffs) it's like roast pork! They promised things that did my spirits rouse and fire; (seeing smoke come from the oven) Which it's the batch—a blazing like a house on fire! (runs to oven door, wrenches it open, a cloud of smoke comes from it) Get out! (slams oven door) It's not to be put out, I see, Would I could say the same of Mrs. D! What's to become of me? Where shall I run? I am afraid to think what I have done; And done too much; look on't again, I'm loath— A king and baker too—one can't make both. (vacantly) Make both! what Caledonian sprite or wraith Prompted my tongue to sound the words, “Mak' baith!” “Mak' baith! Mak' baith! Mak' baith!” oh, pack of stuff! Again it says—“Beware—how ye Mak'-dough!” These fiery scenes have made my senses wander; E'en now I feel as though in Scotland yonder. The land of gallowglasses and of kernes, (pointing tragically to oven) The land of cakes and of immortal Burns! Horror! that well-known footstep's dreaded sound, For well it tells me I'm on English ground; As soon in roundest Saxon she'll inform me, I'm all a shiver—never mind—she'll warm me! (stands before oven, L.) Enter Maude at back, D. in F. Maude. (R.) Bless those dear Danes—what appetites they've got! These fêtes will clear the shop out, stock and lot. Out with the batch! (seeing Alfred frightened) You good for nothing plague, you, What are you trembling with? Alfred. (L.) The quartern ague! Madam, the batch has met, I grieve to say, A trifling accident! (Maude makes a furious gesture) Be calm, I pray! In the best families they will take place— Remember the Atlantic cable's case; That was a twist 'bout which to make a coil, And what's our stock of gingerbread to spoil; Suppose Guy Fawkes—not foiled in his intent— Had blown up all the British parliament? Sweet maids of honour will get over toasted, Even the poet Bunn's been too much roasted! Maude. (pulling him away from oven) Sophist! stand back! (crosses to L.) Alfred. (R.) I soon shall stand corrected So-fistically! Maude. (opening oven) So! as I suspected; I can't find words—you oaf! you lazy loon! But you shall catch it to a pretty tune! (she throws a quartern loaf, which Alfred adroitly catches, and brings forward to her expostulating) Air.—Alfred.—“Pray Goody.” Pray, Goody, please to calculate the missile you have flung, Might smash a party's skull of twice my size; Remember, certain heads are weak, and certain arms are strong A stranger's bones for bread why pulverize? Shy me! Try me! Take what I've saved by me— Scold or “sauce” me, Charge or toss me, For your damaged pies! But, Goody, cease to imitate the weapon called Armstrong, A breast-work slight as mine to pulverize! (Maude bursts into tears) Enter Dunulf and Headred, D. in F. Dun. (coming down R.) What's this? Maude. (L.) You brute! this floor you ne'er set foot upon, Except as now, to see your poor wife put upon. (she attacks Alfred with a rolling pin) Dun. “Give it him, wife, and never mind his fretting; He wants a taste of what I'm always getting” Enter Oddune and Soldiers hastily at back, D. in F. Odd. Up, lads, and at 'em! (strikes up Maude's rolling pin—the Guards overpower Dunulf and Headred. Tableau) Now, what's this about? Come mother Brownrigg—let's hear you—speak out! What's your excuse for turning 'prentice beater? (patting Alfred on his head) Don't be afraid, my lad! I'm not Sir Peter! Alfred. (R. C., aside, sobbing) My faithful Devon! Odd. (patting his shoulder) Come! we're here to free you! Alfred. (unable to control himself any longer) Devon, my boy, I'm Devonish glad to see you. (leaps spasmodically into Oddune's arms, to the great astonishment of that officer) Odd. (C.) That voice—those limbs—that kingly air—yes—no! It is King Alfred! (chord) Maude. (falling on her knees, L.) Murder! Dun. (falling on his knees, R.) Here's a go! Maude (pointing to Dunulf) He set me on, sire! Dun. (pointing to Maude) 'Twas by her direction. Alfred. (C. regally holding out his hand to be kissed) Good people, rise, and count on our protection! (to Oddune) No explanations, spare us further shocks. State the best news—and what's the price of stocks? Odd. This news will raise the stocks, sire, I'll be bound, In every English village—by the pound. Now is the time for help—your eye—you'll find it— Will create soldiers. Alfred. (looking at the small army) Then I'd better mind it If these are all we've left. How Fate would frown upon them, Were there but forty sentries looking down upon them. But have we ne'er a strong-hold left? Odd. (R. C.) I doubt We've aught that's e'en a week old. Alfred. Holds not out Our cloistered Athelney? Odd. (aside) How'll he receive it? Yes, it was holding out when I did leave it; Or rather, hanging out—most royally. Alfred. So! they've not touched the royal property, Our favourite pleasaunce, flanked by elm trees tall, So full of walks, we'd christened it, waux-hall! Where erst we wandered far from courts and camps, 'Neath the cool shadows cast by extra lamps; Where soothing punch, lost peace of mind brought back, When we had set our minds upon the rack! The hermit's cave—half screened from vulgar sight, Where right at anchor, sat our anchorite In solitary state! Stop, that's a blunder, There were more ancore-ites at the Rotunda To hear the singing. Then the platform vast! Where the proceedings were a leetle fast. And, oh, the scenes within that fairy ring, I shall again be master of—! Odd. (R.) Great king, Your mind this flattering vision dispossess of it, And learn the truth at once. Alfred. Humph! I've a guess of it. Odd. Vauxhall is taken in distress; your grounds Turned to a kennel for the Danish hounds; The traitor, Edric, has betrayed the wicket, And passed the foeman in without a ticket; To-night they revel there with feast and clamour; To-morrow brings the gardens to the hammer. (Alfred is overcome à la Macduff) Maude. Nay, never pull your cap, man, o'er your brow. Alfred. You have no garden—Maude, so hold your row. What, all my slender chickens and thin ham At one fell swoop! Odd. Be firm, my liege! Alfred. I am, I swear, alone—unaided—in disguise; This last bespeak, the king shall patronise— Ask not my scheme. To-night I play the spy In Guthrum's tents—first step to victory; To lead my followers— Odd. Who are they? Alfred. (excited) Who? Why you—and you—and you—and you—and you. The first man we appeal to— Dun. (R., enthusiastically) 'Cod! I'm willing! Head. (L.) And I! Alfred. Fall in! we'll owe you each a shilling! E'en women to our standard would repair. Maude. (L. C.) Who can resist him? Here's for Vivandière! (pulls up her skirt by a tape, puts on an oilskin hat, slings a cask over her shoulder, and stands equipped as a “Daughter of the Regiment”) Alfred. Why here's an army formed for our first innings. (aside) Don't sneer at rifle corps with small beginnings. Song and Chorus.—Air, “Villikins and his Dinah.” It is as four rich merchants, which in Liverpool did dwell, In disguise we will go, and this Guthrum compel To declare his intentions, and publish the lot, If he means to invade this here country or not. Singing —Too ral, lol loo ral, ol loo ral, li—lea. (stops reflectingly) Though I'm not quite so sure that's a brilliant idea. We should look less like fools, and 'twould be better for us, To finish the song to the popular chorus— Air changes to “Dumble dum deary.” Of—Form! form! riflemen, form! Riflemen! riflemen! riflemen, form! They march off at D. in F. as scene closes in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duet, “A Life by the Galley Fire.” Alfred. A light at the oven fire I'll raise, if you won't get riled; The shock of a lady's ire Is not what suits this child. Maude. I am going a call to make; On the batch keep watchful eyes, Or you'll find, if I don't mistake, There are crustier things than pies. (together) Alfred. I'll light up a roaring fire, Where an ox might whole be br'iled; The shock of a lady's ire Is not what suits this child. What suits, &amp;c. Maude. Look after the batch and fire; If there's anything burnt or sp'iled, Look out for disasters dire; You know what suits this child. What suits, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fourth. —Ante Room in the Palace at Athelney. Knocks heard as of guests arriving. Enter Edric, L. 1 E., dressed for the evening, putting on his gloves. Edric. 'Tis now the very witching time of night, When cabs draw up and early guests alight. I've hurried somewhat from the regions upper To choose a place near the best fowls at supper; And in a gen'ral way, as best I can, Take mean advantage of my fellow-man. Song.—I'm off to Charlestown.” My last remains of conscience I've rudely torn away, And gone into the villain line, commencing from to-day. (drawing dagger) I mean to stick at nothing that's injurious to my kind, Nor to stick at anybody—saving safely from behind. I've turned a scoundrel, Law and morals scorning; I've turned a scoundrel, in quite a wholesale way; Give my respects to all the ugly customers, I've turned a scoundrel, and open shop to-day. Enter Elswith, L., in waiting maid's costume, ushering in Ceolwulf. Elswith. (C.) Please let me take your hat, sir. (Ceolwulf gives her his damaged helmet—Edric takes it from her, and inspects it carefully) Ceol. (L.) By your leave. It's met an accident. Edric. (R.) Yes, I perceive. (aside—comparing it with his own) My own's worth two of it! (returns it to Elswith Elswith. (aside) He doesn't know me! Edric. (to Ceolwulf) Pitched off your horse, sir? Ceol. Where's the horse could throw me? No! an encounter with some vulgar dogs, Whom I sent skipping like so many frogs. Footpads, I fancy; they the woods infest— I killed about a score—and spared the rest. I shouldn't mind, but it's disturbed one's toilet. Elswith. (aside) Come—when a fib's well told, 'twere shame to spoil it. Trio—Ceolwulf, Elswith and Edric—Air, “Turn on, old Time.” Ceol. I've come in time, in our class (twice) And rank of life a fault outré. (twice) I should have waited for the mass (twice) Of vulgar guests for my entreé. (twice) Elswith. He's come in time to tell a mass (twice) Of dreadful fibs, in style outré, (twice) Yet let his idle stories pass, (twice) Nor grudge per line their worth to pay. (twice) Ensemble. Elswith. Like his, oh! there are many tricks, Which all reporters glibly know, To make the simplest street-rows pass For battles grand as Alma's day. Like his, oh! there are many tricks, Which all reporters glibly know, To make the merest garden sticks Enormous cabbages to grow. Yes, cabbages to grow. Yes, cabbages to grow. Cabbages grow. Cabbages grow! Ceol. Of what avail, one's studied tricks And graceful bows, if one must go Into a ball room like an ass, With no one there to cause dismay, Except the usual early sticks Of punctual wall-flowers in a row— Except the usual early sticks Of punctual wall-flowers in a row. Of wall-flowers in a row. Of wall-flowers in a row. Row! Edric. Despite his style he seems an ass, Talk glibly as he may, This chance I do not mean to pass, Of making his acquaintance pay. At whist there are full many tricks, And dice, if well the die we throw; While cribbage pegs are single sticks, With which to lay a greenhorn low. To lay a greenhorn low. To lay a greenhorn low. A greenhorn low. A greenhorn low. At end of trio Elswith conducts Ceolwulf out, R., Edric following draws a dagger, and attempts to stab Ceolwulf in a melo-dramatic style; Ceolwulf turns round and eyes him through glass, Edric bows—they exeunt, R. Enter Guthrum, L., looking very ill, supported by Ina and Oswith—knocking, L. Ina. (R.) And you consent? Guth. (C.) Yes, but we're far from well. (knock) Not quite so loud! (bell) Silence that dreadful bell! Oswith. (L.) For this I am your servant evermore. (knock) Guth. (R.) Then please to stop that knocking at the door. Its unendurable—our head will split. Oswith. (going, L.) It shall be silenced— Guth. Stay! the room don't quit! Blest with your love, my chosen son and daughter— (Edric who has re-entered, R., with Ceolwulf, unobserved, starts on hearing this) With time's assistance and some Seltzer water, We may be happy yet! Edric. (R.) If all the same, Would you just bear in mind my little claim? Guth. (C.) My honest miscreant—my faithful traitor! Who on our gratitude a claim has greater What would you like? Our heart and purse command! Edric. You're very kind! I'll take that lady's hand— Oswith. (L.) Hands off! 'Tis mine! Guth. He speaks the truth. Edric. Indeed! I trust you'll know your own handwriting. Read! (gives paper) Guth. These are our royal pothooks! Yet—pooh! pooh! We promise our beloved child to you? Edric. Of the agreement there's the written trophy, sir. Guth. (suddenly remembering, in deep anguish) Oh! that a man should put a sheriff's officer Into his mouth to seize upon his brains. My child, 'tis true, when rack'd by fev'rish pains We gave that fatal promise yestermorn; Blame not thy parent—'twas the Hirlas Horn. Ina. (L. C.) I wed no man, save gentle Oswith he! Oswith. (L.) All disputants of that, refer to me. Guth. (C.) This is most awkward; Odin has my oath! Ina. And Oswith mine!— Guth. Just so; we can't keep both. (to Edric) How would you like a consul's situation? Edric. A very inefficient consul-ation. Guth. What's to be done? One can't break heads or hearts. Who shall decide? Enter Alfred, L., announcing himself. Alfred. The baker with the tarts! (he carries a tray on his head, a muffin basket on his arm, a bell in his hand, a banjo slung at his back—he walks very majestically—Oswith recognizes him, takes tray and hands it to Servant, R.) Guth. (C.—peevishly) This is annoying! Couldn't you as well D'ye think, my friend, have rung the area bell? This is a private room! Alfred. (L.—aside) Oh, fatal blunder! The force of kingly habit; 'tis no wonder! My chance of safety lies 'twixt flight and chaff. (to Guthrum playfully) Why, as an officer upon the staff, I thought my place was near the royal person. Guth. The staff! Alfred. (poking him in the ribs) Of life, old boy—you've heard a worse un! Guth. (aside) This sample of the British operative Raises my good opinion of the native. My friend— Alfred. And pitcher, if you like. Guth. Why such? Alfred. I'm here for pumping on. Guth. (aside) I like him much! A cause of quarrel 'twixt these two young men, mark: This youth (Oswith) our page, or footman— Alfred. Not from Denmark. Guth. What makes you say so? Alfred. What! a thing of course, man, If he's a footman he can't be a 'norseman. Guth. (R. aside, delighted) This is a man to know! Alfred. (L.) Your language spare— I know the bearings of the whole affair! Guth. (surprised) Mysterious man! if not by incantation, How came you by this wondrous information? Alfred. Who to the baker's man for talent comes up, At the great art of picking little crumbs up! Song.—Alfred—Air, “Nothing More.” The march of information keeps, With that of commerce pace; Our tradesmen teach us all we learn, In each suburban place. Your housemaid tells you “Bailiffs Are in at number four;” You ask her how she learnt it— “From the milk”—and nothing more. You hear your cook, Jemima, talk Across the rails to Jane, How Mrs. Jones, just up the row, “Who's took to drink again. She smugs it in as med'cine, Through the chemist's aid next door;” “Good gracious, Jane, who told you that?” “The pot boy”—nothing more. You're called upon to judge the case Of Mrs. Meagrim Bounce, Who keeps a brough'm, yet don't consume, Of meat, per day, an ounce; While that poor child in buttons, She starves to death's next door. You ask, whence comes the knowledge? “From the butcher—nothing more.” Guth. Then in your wisdom dark, perchance you can Suggest a remedy? Alfred. I have a plan. There lacks the cheering feature of a fight! Let them dispute the prize in friendly strife— The man who's easy thrashed can't want a wife. Guth. A glorious project to our way of thinking, Guthrum loves fighting more—well—next to drinking, Go, arm yourselves! Oswith. (L.) Let him expect a smasher! Edric. (R., aside) I shall look up the Somersetshire slasher! Guth. Our pleasure to express—we feel unable— And can but say— Enter Servant, R. 1 E., announcing. Servant. (R. 1 E.) Wittles is on the table! Exit Servant, R. Concerted Piece.—Air, “Varsovienne.” Guth. Will you take the Princess? Ceol. Most decidedly—yes! Edric. I must really confess That I think that a slight. All. To the first of the feast We can all run at least— Though our speed be decreased To the end of the fight! Exeunt, all but Alfred, R. 1 E. Alfred. Yes—so far—all goes well—this is the night That either makes me—or fordoes me quite! Song.—Air, “Death of Nelson.” 'Cos in Trafalgar Square I want my statue there, (To be paid for I don't say when,) With the kings and warrior folk, The hearts of steel and oak, And the waxy-natur men; With Napier and with Nelson brave— A monument of stone to have; I mean to make a duty— I mean to make a duty— Along the line of statues there— Alfred expects as something rare His own may prove a beauty! Exit, R. 1 E.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fifth. —The Royal Property, and “Great Anglo-Saxon Circus” illuminated for the Peace rejoicings. A semi-circle walled in like an Astley's ring down to the first entrance; at the back of the ring a small waterfall, C., with rocks on each side. Guthrum seated on a throne, R., forward—Ina at his side—Haldane, Otho, &amp;c., in attendance. The fight between Oswith and Edric just over—Oswith, R., triumphant, bowing to the applause of spectators—Edric, L., prostrate—Ceolwulf applying restoratives—Dunulf and Headred mingling with the Crowd unobserved—Maude seated in ridiculous state, L. The Scene opens to a loud shout and flourish—Oswith bows modestly all round. Guth. Saxon! the palm is yours. Come, take the spoil. (rises and gives Ina's hand to him—they embrace) (to Edric) My injured friend, the palm you want's palm oil! Edric. (aside) Gall! Wormwood! Hemlock! Strychnine! Bitter cup! Vinegar and brown paper! Pick me up. I'll be avenged! He is carried out, L. 1 E. Guth. So! freed from strife's enmeshment, Let us proceed to music and refreshment. Enter Alfred, L. U. E., and comes forward. Guth. (to Alfred) My farinaceous friend, from you to-night We shall expect great things; I know we're right. About you there's a free and easy air Which proves you've been accustomed to the chair; We're quite impatient for your banjo's tones, While as a baker you must know the bones. Oblige us with a song. Alfred. (L.) Ahem! of course, I scarcely need inform you I'm dead hoarse? Guth. 'Tis needless—quite! Alfred. (L.) Or that I am out of practice? Guth. (R.) A superfluity! Alfred. Or that the fact is I haven't brought my music? Guth. We'll dispense With such formalities. Alfred. Then I'll commence. What's it to be? Guth. Of choice we'll make no fuss, So that it's complimentary to us. (Alfred commences after much affectation of preludizing) Song.—Alfred.—Air, “The tight little island.” Mother Europe one day Unto Freedom did say There's not much room for you upon my land, If a corner you'd hit on, Secure little Britain.— Said Freedom, “Why, that's my own island!” For—oh! it's a nice little island! And whatever foe touches the island, Be he fierce—be he strong, He won't stop very long, Or do very much harm to the island. Guth. and Danes. (rise angrily) Hah! Alfred. Prefer an older and a thinner whine? Something in the Lachrymæ Christy line, Or say a gem picked up in the last scramble Out of the Caledonian stores of Campbell? Song.—Alfred.—Air, “Whar do you come from?” It's a berry lubly night, and the stars are shining bright, And de critters from de north am a coming into sight. De wolves dey come to howl, and the bears dey come to dance; And de frogs dey want to come, but dey couldn't get a chance. I ask him whar he comes from? Who does he belong to? Wonder whar he's going to? Faddly um ti day! Oh! Mr. Dane, you have crossed de main, For the gallant sea achievement of returning back again. Dere's a bull-dog on a bank, and a bull-frog in a pool; De frog he get excited, but de dog him berry cool. De frog he want to quarrel, but de bull-dog lift him paw; And so de matter ended in a quantity of jaw. But I ask him whar he come from, &amp;c. At end of song as the Danes are drawing their swords very angrily, Elswith enters, R. 1 E. Elswith. (agitated) Who sang that air? Guth. (up R. angrily) This ere! Elswith. (aside) It is not he! And yet—who else could sound that upper G? (looks enquiringly at Alfred) Alfred. (L. aside) Be still my heart! it is my queen elect! (Edric comes down to his elbow, L., Alfred bursts out into refrain of song) Edric. (C. aside) The looseness of a screw I here suspect! (to Elswith Young woman! Elswith. (R. timidly) Sir! Edric. You know this man? Elswith. (who has recognized Alfred) Yes!—No! He served our family some time ago. Edric. (searchingly) Your family? Elswith. (nervously correcting herself) That—of—the habitation, Where I last held a menial situation. Edric. (aside) A servant girl had said in such a case— “The folks as kep' the 'ouse of my last place!” You were attached to them? (Alfred makes signs to her, she does not comprehend) Elswith. (R., crying) Respect my grief! (wipes her eyes) Edric. (R. C.) Just let me see that pocket handkerchief! (snatches it from her, and hastily inspects the corner) “Elswith”—a coronet! (aloud to Guthrum) Chief! bless this hour! King Alfred's bride elect is in your power! (all rise in astonishment) Guth. (R. C.) Lock up the postern gates and count the spoons! Alfred. (R. aside, hurriedly to Elswith) Swear that you're not, or we're departed coons! Guth. (looking at Elswith) As a mere servant she was barely handsome, But through the medium of a queenly ransom, In our mind's eye—her charms become divine. (to Elswith) Bewitching captive! Port or sherry wine? Support the chair! (leads her to seat, R.) Ho! let the sports proceed! (Alfred and Oswith have been talking apart earnestly up, L. C., they come down, C.) Alfred. (L.) Thou hast no fear? Oswith. (R. C.) Your majesty! Alfred. (seizing his hand) Agreed! 'Tis our sole chance! once safe o'er yonder torrent, We can defy arrest—writ—capias—warrant. Return in force—this ill-watched camp besiege; Rescue our brides in no time— Oswith. But, my liege, Think of your precious life! Alfred. A trifling matter! Enough! I'll go and change! tip 'em the patter! Exit Alfred, L. 1 E., Oswith goes up. (a ballet takes place, at end of which Oswith comes forward in the manner of a street conjuror, and clears a ring) Oswith. (à la showman) Ladies and Gentlemen, with your permission, I beg to introduce for exhibition, One whose appearance here will prove a staggerer— The celebrated Blondin, from Niagara, Has been engaged at an expense prodigious. Yon waterfall! with the tight rope to bridge us, 'Twill do your eyes good, open them, in fact, His operation for the cataract. Which in this hope, brings folks from every distance, To see a man a-bridging his existence. Music.—Enter Alfred, L., in a tight acrobat suit, bowing. In the meantime Dunulf and another stretch a thick rope across the torrent. Oswith. Professor Blondin, from the States! Omnes. Bravo! Oswith. (C.) The eyes of Europe are upon you, Alfred. (L. aside to him) Oh! Of Eur-ope—eh? Oswith. Yes, they've been waiting long enough. Alfred. How about my rope, though—I hope it's strong enough! Dun. (L.) The strongest hemp! Alfred. It should be something coarser, My line is that of Hengist and of Horse-hair! Oswith. The sports can now proceed—the little man Will walk three times around the Cairawan! Music.—Alfred walks round, then prepares for his ascent; a balance pole is given to him by Dunulf, and he goes up the rocks, R., and then crosses cautiously to L.—murmurs of applause—he then returns and performs a tight-rope dance; Maude and Dunulf let off each a squib on each side of him, he bows, and withdraws behind rock, R.—shouts of applause. Oswith. That was his first—now he'll go through his latter act, Professor Blondin next will cross the cataract. Encumbered by a second person's weight, The wond'rous feat that proves him truly great. In fact—the greatest ass of any quorum, That e'er attempted the pons asinorum. On this occasion, I—more bold than wary, Will act as the professor's secretary. Alfred comes down, they both bow and retire up rocks, R. Shouts of “Bravo! bravo!” Edric. (L. aside) The bridge! the torrent! he shall get a floorer, 'Tis not for nothing that I've seen Dinorah! A rocket! ha! Exit, L. 1 E. Oswith. (behind rock piece, R.) Don't spill us, mind! (Alfred.) (ditto) Hold tight! Don't be afraid! now then— Oswith. Drive on! all right! Alfred appears on bridge, R., slowly wheeling Oswith over in a wheelbarrow—Edric re-enters, L. 1 E. Concerted piece.—“Fra Diavolo.” Ina. From yonder rock a riding, That rash and daring youth behold, Fast his hands the sides unfold, 'Tis his best plan to hold! Alfred. This way, all fear deriding, All acrobats in shade I throw, Of Astley's—or the famed Anglo- Saxony Circus Co. (the barrow appears to slip—a movement of terror) Ina, Elswith, Maude, &amp; Ceolwulf. Tremble! Edric. (aside, L.) Yes! Tremble! A firework-scheme's completing, Il Joel's efforts beating, Diavolo! Diavolo! Diavolo! At the last “Diavolo!” a rocket comes down and appears to strike Oswith—a crash heard, and the rope breaks; Alfred and Oswith disappear into the abyss—great consternation, and the scene closes to hurried music.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Sixth. —Front of a Prison; practicable door and window. Enter Haldane, as a sentinel, L. Hald. (after pacing up and down) I wish 'twas time for sending round the picket, Here I've to do long stop, and keep the wicket; We've caught one fish, the other swam away— The greater gudgeon of the two they say. E'en Alfred's self. Ah! well, they're ticklish gentry. (Oswith appears at grated window, R. flat) Oswith. I say, old chap, are you the nineteenth cent'ry One hears so much about? Hald. (L. C.) You mustn't joke! Oswith. That's very arbitrary. May I smoke? Hald. Against the laws in spirit and in letter. Oswith. Hang it! One may as well be a poor debtor. (shaking a bar) Help us through this, I'll make it worth your while. You seem a most respectable old file; Suppose we cut it? Hald. (menacing him with partisan) Shameful proposition! Oswith. Help us, at least, in filing one's petition. Disappears, threatened by Haldane. Hald. He's safe! I'll take a turn around the fort, He can't get out, excepting through the court. Exit, L. Enter Dunulf, R. 1 E. Dun. This is the dreadful cell where Oswith pines, I don't quite understand the king's designs; But, like a cavalier unused to ride Through London streets, I'm told to “get inside,” To pave the way for him, as prison breaker. Enter Haldane, L. Hald. (entering) Who's there? Dun. (R.) A friend. Hald. You mean to say a “quaker.” Dun. (trembling) I do feel nervous. Sir, I beg your pardon. What is the case in point? (pointing to prison window) Hald. Rather a hard 'un. He roasts at sunrise. Dun. Roasts—you don't mean biled? (Haldane shakes his head) Unhappy child! in either case he's spiled. (aside) What line of business ought I to follow? Ha! the example of Peruvian Rolla. Look on this chain of massive gold! Hald. Away! Would'st bribe an old Norwegian? Dun. (aside) Change the lay! He'd soon find out that it was only copper. Soldier! hast thou a wife? Hald. (shuddering) I have, a whopper! Dun. Suppose a comrade at your prison gate Sought for admission; finding it too late Before your execution to remind you, That the aforesaid girl you've left behind you, Had found you out, and would an audience win. Hald. Well? Dun. Oswith has a wife! Hald. Enough—get in! Exeunt into prison, L. Enter Ina, with her hair dishevelled, followed by Elswith, R. Duet.—“The Two Cousins.” Both. Yes, it is, after all—a most desperate fall, From the height of ambition and prospects divine. To the depths of despair, And the tearing of hair, Ina., Elswith. For partners aren't all like that lost one of mine, Though her partner is not like that lost one of mine! Elswith. One word, my Danish cousin; You must own it's far too bad, While I am merely doleful—you Should go stark staring mad. Just consider, mine's a monarch, While your own's a simple knight, To rank your loss as more than mine— You know it is not right. Ina. Dispense with any lectures, coz; Between myself and you— I've not gone mad in earnest, And I've no intention to. Those signs of aberration will On Guthrum's feelings play; And Oswith's dreadful doom revoke— So let me have my way. Both. Then it's not after all such a desperate fall, From the heights of ambition and prospects divine, Go as mad as I like, Go as mad as you like, If the plan chance to strike, We may both turn the tables and never repine.

Pooh! we're as the Medes and Persians, Besides, they're men of Wessex here—not Mercians, This chance of an example's a delightful one— I hope they've thought of making him a frightful one! Edric. (L.) I've seen to that—the victim's form I've deck'd, In the most hideous garb I could select— So to strike terror in each rebel subject, By shewing them a real revolting object. Guth. 'Tis well! (to Haldane) how fares our daughter! Hald. (R.) She at present Seems under a delusion not unpleasant— She thinks with Oswith, 'tis her wedding day— Guth. Poor child! indulge her wayward fancy's play! Hald. We have, sire, e'en in its most wild excesses— She orders—oh! such heaps of bridal dresses; Jewels—wreaths—feathers—wedding feasts and coaches— Guth.

Music from Norma.—Changing to “Please to remember the Fifth of November.” Enter the Sacrificial Procession.—Dunulf, Maude, Oddune, and other Saxons, disguised as Priests and Priestesses of Odin.

The chair is put down on stage, R. C. Hald. (L.) Is this the noble Oswith? Oh! how changed! Edric. (in L. corner) I may say—ha! ha! ha! I am revainged! Guth. (to the Victim) Prisoner on the bars, that is to be, The Ordeal of Domestic Cookery! You've one chance left to 'scape from if you will— And as a raw recruit continue still. (Victim strikes ridiculous attitudes) Give up King Alfred's cause? (Victim shakes his head) In any case Give up the secret of his hiding-place? (Victim more violent than before) At least, desist from such gesticulation, So unbecoming in your situation. (Victim continues more violently) I see my warnings are superfluous! Light up at once! Enter Ina, R. 1 E., pale and dishevelled, in the stage maniac style—draws a dagger from her bosom, and is about to stab herself. Ina. Oswith! I wed thee thus! (chord) The real Oswith runs in, R. 1 E., and arrests her hand—tableau. Guth. (L. C.) Two Oswith's in the field! (movement on the part of the Danes) Oswith. (R., looking at the Victim) Do I sit there? Who in my place has dared to take the chair On this occasion? Ha! I see it all! That muffled form within my prison wall— That smell of chloroform—Oh! 'tis most certain. (to the Victim) Sir, may I ask, is your name Sidney Carton? Guth. The name is immaterial to the end— Put Oswith down at once—for self and friend! (pointing to Alfred) (chord.—Alfred throws off his disguise, and stands armed before Guthrum—Soldiers remove chair) Alfred. Let fall thy knife. Butcher and cook in one! The beef of England isn't to be done! Britons, strike home! The fires of vengeance kindle! Explode at once this antiquated swindle! Music.—The statue of Odin and the altar are blown up and disappear—Oddune, Dunulf, Maude, &amp;c. throw off their disguises, and engage hand to hand with the Danes—Edric runs out, Oswith fights off with Haldane, single combat between Alfred and Guthrum, Guthrum defeated—Saxons re-enter at end of fight victorious. Alfred. (standing over Guthrum) Like any more? Guth. Not any, if you please. Alfred. (picking him up by his waistband à la pantaloon) Well, then, jump up, and let's conclude a peace. Guth. (humbly) I'll sing whatever pledge seems fit to you. Alfred. I won't be hard; the temp'rance one will do; Give up the Hirlas Horn and stick to coffee! Enter Elswith, L. 1 E., and runs to embrace Aflred. Elswith, my bride! victory's dearest trophy; Pardon all traitors! Set all captives free!
