      <field name="fulltext">Dedication, by Vittorio Alfieri, to TIMOLEON. TO THE MOST NOBLE PASCAL DE PAOLI, The magnanimous Defender of the Corsicans.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Timoleon. Timophanes. Echilus. Demariste. Soldiers of Timophanes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Dwelling of Timophanes in Corinth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Timophanes, Echilus. Tim. Echilus, no; if at my side the sword Distain'd with blood thou seest, to use force I am not led by haughtiness of heart; The general good impels me thus to act; The fame of Corinth which in me has placed Its delegated power. Ech. Heaven knows I love thee! Betwixt us even from our earliest years The strictest ties of amity were formed, To which more sanctimonious ties of blood Were added afterwards. A happier day I never saw than that on which I gave thee, As consort, my beloved, only sister. When against Argos and Pleones fighting, I witnessed by thy side unheard-of proofs Of martial valour, thou subduedst me With wonder that enhanced my former fondness. Thou canst not, and thou oughtest not to live Obscure in privacy: but I behold The most illustrious blood of Corinth spilled By thee; and thou a tyrant's odious name Dost thence acquire. Such hitherto I deem Thou art not; but intense disquietude In hearing this consumes me. Tim. And perchance, In acting thus, a grief not less intense Preys on my heart. Yet what else can I do, If I am forced, in order to secure The city's quiet, to adopt such measures? That full four hundred swords should wait my nod, Even my fellow citizens themselves Have deemed advisable. I have mown down, 'Tis true, some lives distinguished, but obnoxious, Which were already equitably due To public vengeance; and there still remain Ill-disposed persons of that corrupt seed, Who, having long been used to sell themselves, Their city, and their suffrages, complain Of my authority. That power they find Too great a hindrance to their venal guilt; Hence all this envy, tumult, and disturbance. Ech. Confusion, discord, and the love of party, The insolence of the nobles, it is true, Almost have overwhelmed us. And, perchance, What form of government would suit us best, 'Twould now perplex me to decide: but all With me protest, that we will ne'er endure A form that is not absolutely free. With more complacency I should behold Thy methods to secure internal peace, If they were purchased with less blood. Tim. Sometimes Blood, for the sake of sparing it, is spilled. If from the infected frame I do not lop The injured members, can the rest be cured? From the most corrupt magistrates, in part, The city I've delivered: it behoves us To trace so many evils to their source, And fortify with renovated laws, Applied with judgment, the infirm republic. If he is called a tyrant who renews The laws, I am a tyrant; but to him Who tramples on them, if this epithet More properly belong, I am not one. The wishes of the many are accomplished By every deed of mine: the few complain; Let them complain unheeded! Ech. If thy brother, That man of unexampled worth, Timoleon, Enrol himself among them, canst thou say That they are few? More than himself he loves thee; And yet he openly condemns thy conduct. I fain would think thy objects laudable; But too impetuous, e'en in a good cause 'Tis more than possible thou may'st adopt Measures too violent: for one to grasp, Whatever be his object, sovereign power, Timophanes, believe me, is an act Of perilous presumption; and to me Seems most tremendous; having power to injure, Alas! most commonly provokes to injure. Tim. Thou speakest wisely; but if ardent passions Push not men on to lofty enterprize, Calm wisdom never will accomplish it. In LacedÃ¦mon thou didst see Lycurgus, Who wished to make his absolute controul Subservient to the universal good: Was not e'en he constrained to make himself A tyrant, to demolish tyranny? Alas, 'tis force alone then can compel To virtuous actions a degenerate people. Ech. Thou hast that force. May heaven direct thee then To apply it worthily to worthy ends. SCENE THE SECOND. Demariste, Timophanes, Echilus. Dem. My son, all Corinth with thy name resounds, But diversely. Yet is it to my heart A flattering consciousness that I'm thy mother. Thou wert the champion of thy country; thence I, on the other hand, lament to hear That thou'rt suspected of equivocal, And private views: it grieves me, that in Corinth, One citizen, though wrongfully, should hate thee. For thee am I too anxious. Tim. Oh, my mother, Less would'st thou love me, if thy fears were less. I venture to confront a glorious danger: But such are the discordant obligations On us imposed; a lady, thou should'st fear, And I should challenge fear. Dem. It pleases me This thy audacious military pride: I deem myself no private citizen; But mother of two heroes, one of whom Were more than requisite to raise me far Above each Grecian mother. Every wish Were now accomplished, could Timoleon act With thee in concert, and attemper, thus, With his strong sense, âthe mettle of thy spirits.â Tim. Perhaps in his heart Timoleon hitherto From me dissents not; but the transient hate Which ever misinterprets the designs Of those who dare to innovate, he shuns; And meanwhile leaves me in the perilous lists To toil alone. Ech. In this thou art deceived; Already have I told thee so: thy schemes He disapproves; far less, if he did not, The number of thy foes. Dem. Thou speakest well; For this I came. Timoleon is in years Alone not equal to thyself, canst thou Disdain to have him then in all thy schemes Thy coadjutor? His amenity Is fitted to controul thy eager rashness. Fatherless children I already see, Afflicted widows, mothers destitute, Cast towards me their discontented looks; On me, as on the cause of all their woes. Many by thee have fallen: if rightfully, Why does thy brother blame thee for it? Why, If wrongfully, dost thou thus act? In Corinth The greatest virtue, not the greatest power, Gave us at first precedency. Ah yes, Upon the terrible footsteps of my sons Let tears be shed, but be they tears of foes; And let the citizens exult with joy On your beloved steps; let me receive Their benedictions that I am your mother. Tim. Yes, in the camp where valour only gains Precedency, the first place to ourselves We ourselves give: within the idle walls Of a divided city, envy, arm'd With calumny and fraud, the chiefest place, To those who have a claim to it, denies. 'Tis indispensable, too certainly! That we endure, prelusive to long joy, Transient distress, would we exterminate This deadly serpent; and whoe'er does this Must look for glory after long endurance. That in proportion as I merit glory, My brother feels for me less love, I grieve. Dem. Vile and invidious thoughts in him? ... Tim. I think not; But yet ... Ech. But yet, no lofty enterprize Thou e'er canst consummate, if strenuously With heart and hand he aid thee not. Tim. From this Who hinders him? I have entreated him A thousand times: averse he always seemed. My coadjutor I disdain him not; But I endure him not my interrupter. Dem. Can I a peril patiently behold, To which thou'rt liable by him unshared; Or see thee gain an undivided triumph? Echilus, go to him; to this abode, Which for a long time now no more he deems The dwelling of his brother or his mother, Bring him to us. Or he shall be convinced By us, or we by him; so that to-day One thought alone, one object, and one will To Demariste and her sons, be law. SCENE THE THIRD. Demariste, Timophanes. Tim. Perhaps he will come at thy entreaties; long Has he to my repeated ones been deaf: He as a foe avoids me. Thou wilt hear, How every scheme of mine malignantly With dark hues he disfigures. Dem. Evermore Timoleon is the epitome of virtue. Thou construest not such praise to thy reproach? Of one son to another may a mother Speak it unblamed. I wish to hear from him Why he avoids thee. That thou'rt loved by him, Thou knowest: with his premature discretion He formerly attempered the excesses Of thy too fervent early years; himself Caused thee of the Corinthian cavalry To be elected captain: well may'st thou That fatal day remember, when thy valour Had too far onward with thy partizans Blindly impell'd thee, and entangled thee Among the Argive spears: who rescued thee From certain ruin on that fatal day? Say did not he at his most imminent risk, And he alone, perchance, to thy adherents Preserve their honour, to thyself thy life, And victory to Corinth? Tim. Mother, I Am not ungrateful; all I recollect. Ah, yes, my life is his; for him I keep it: As much as glory I my brother love: Tremendous dangers I alone confront; He afterwards the precious fruit of this, If so he will, may taste with me in peace. But what do I suggest? He has not been, For a long time, what he was once to me. He ranks among his most beloved friends My most inveterate foes. That Archidas, That overbearing and flagitious judge, Who at his will now absolutely rules This residue of magistrates, who dares, In tones of rage and envy, to proclaim me Worthy of death; inseparable friend, Guide, and adviser is he to my brother.â Why cruelly preserve my life, if he Afterwards plots to rob me of a treasure Far, far more preciousâfame? Dem. Do not believe He acts with inadvertency or malice? Let us first hear him. Tim. Mother, we will hear him. Ah, be not this the day to manifest That he in brotherly kindness is defective, Or that I am ungrateful! Thou knowest well That he himself would take from me that power With which he formerly invested me; That he professes this? Dem. 'Twere better far That he shared it with thee: in both of you Is equal valour; suffer that I say it, In prudence he surpasses thee: united, What would ye not perform? What government Could be so admirably harmonized? What mother, than myself, more fortunate, If with one glory and one power resplendent, I saw you brothers, heroes, leaders, friends? Tim. Oh mother, that thou shalt not gain thy wish, I swear to thee it shall not rest with me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Timophanes, Echilus. Ech. Timoleon comes this instant: to thy prayers And mine reluctantly he lent an ear; Nothing constrain'd him but his mother's wishes. Tim. Among his many virtues I know well A yielding heart he counts not: but to-day, If upright meanings, join'd to upright deeds, Will ever profit me, will be the time, When his inflexibility will yield To my persuasions; or that day will now Arise no more. Ech. With him that last I hear It always seems to me as if the truth Resided; yet the truth is one alone. By friendship and by blood to thee conjoin'd, By friendship and by reverence to him, I fain would find a mean by which, to both, I might display my undissembled love. Ah! be united; and to your resolves Myself, my heart, my mind, my sword, my substance, Do not disdain to accept as ministers. Tim. I know thee well, Echilus ... But I see Timoleon coming: leave us both together; I would at length converse with him; to me He may in single conference perchance More unreservedly disclose his thoughts. SCENE THE SECOND. Timoleon, Timophanes. Tim. Once more, my brother, I behold thee here; Within these lares, though inflexibly By thee deserted, always thine. I grieve That only the entreaties of my mother, And not thy own spontaneous will, to-day Restore thee to my sight. Timol. Timophanes ... Tim. What do I hear?âthou call'st me no more brother? Perchance thou deem'st it a disgrace? Timol. One blood, One mother, and one country, gave us birth, Timophanes: a brother hitherto I am to thee; thou callest me a brother. Tim. Ah! what unmerited and harsh rebuke To me thou offerest! ... In which of us Did anger first arise? What do I say? Anger 'twixt us? Thou only art with me Incensed. From me thou fleddest; thou didst first From our maternal home withdraw thy feet. Did I not, to retain thee there, employ Tears and entreaties? But thou gavest ear More willingly to injurious calumnies Than to my cries. To thy rage, rage, oh no! But love, forbearance, reason I opposed In vain.âThou seest now in what esteem I hold thee: in the arms of prosperous fate Me thou abandonedst; hence I indulged A hope, nay, certain faith, that I should find thee In adverse fate a refuge: I meanwhile Hoped evermore to soften thee, and make thee Enter as partner in my joyful state ... Timol. Joyful! Oh! what say'st thou? How speedily, Since I have ceased to see thee, hast thou past, Beyond all bounds, the licence of misrule! To shed blood every day, a joyful state! Tim. But thou thyself, whose days were evermore Illumed by justice and controul'd by truth, Didst thou not gain for me the power I hold, The guerdon of my services, thyself? What force then is it of an adverse fate Which always causes, if one man shed blood, The action to be deem'd tyrannical, While if a number share in shedding it, 'Tis call'd a deed of justice? Timol. Hear me.âWe Brought up together, fully know each other. Ambitious, thus prevented from obeying; Impetuous, which made evermore to thee All moderate command impossible: Such in thy house, in Corinth, in the camp, Wert thou. Tim. Dost thou for the gift perchance Of victory and life upbraid me now, Which it seemed good to thy discerning valour To give me in the camp? Timol. That gift of mine Arose from duty, not beneficence; At that conjuncture fortune smiled on me. Now make me not repent it. Than thyself I never saw a more accomplish'd warrior: Nor a more valiant leader than thou wert Did Corinth e'er possess. But afterwards, When from internal broils it was esteem'd A cure (and of all ills it was the worst) To keep a standing army, and elect Over that army a perpetual head, If thou wert chosen to the perilous honour, If on thyself the military power, Join'd to the civil, fell, impute not thou To me the fault. I do not controvert, I was reluctant to appear myself More diffident for a brother, than I saw That others for a mere compatriot were. But for thee, from that day, for thee I trembled, And for my country more; nor in my heart Did envy enter; no, I wept alone At thy distinction. Tim. My distinction! How? Was it not also thine? My counsellor, My friend, my leader, wert thou not to me, If so thou wouldest? and had we put forth, Thy judgment thou, and I my enterprize, Whom should we then have fear'd? Timol. Whether thou deem Thyself my brother or my monarch, now In all respects inaptly thou with me Adoptest flatteries.âOh, what sayest thou? Wert thou not deaf to every word of mine, From that disastrous day when thou wert raised To unprecedented, unaccustomed power?â Was not our former unpretending dwelling Begirt with guards? Proudly with royal pomp Didst thou not issue thence? On every face Mingled alarm and indignation sate. The thresholds of this house, no longer mine, By impious sycophants besieged. To truth Denied all entrance; impious detractors, Thirsting for gold and blood, audaciously Flocking in crowds; and mercenary spies And satellites, and tears, and arms, and quarrels, Silence and terror ... Saw I not all this? ... And do not I (ah too much!) see it yet? Could such a fierce and ominous assemblage Form a fit train for me? Hence I withdrew, For this was not a citizen's abode; And in my bosom, far more yet than anger, I carried with me pity for thyself, And for thy error and infatuate pride. I palliated thy repeated faults For a long time; the people and the nobles, Heard me asseverate often that thou would'st not E'er make thyself a tyrant. Wretched me! For thee degraded, for thy sake become A liar, I almost, in thy cause, was A traitor to my country; for thy heart I fully understood. Ungrateful brother! To rescue thee from danger, and avert, Through thy means, such dishonour to myself, Thus did I act; and not to clear for thee A way to guilty power, but to leave thee One for repentance ... Tim. And for this intent Thou hast selected in my stead new brothers 'Mid my most open, bitterest enemies ... Timol. The few remaining lovers of their country In them I've chosen. I consort with these, Not from my hate to thee, but love to them; And haply to suspend (since thou wilt not Divert it from thee) that just lofty vengeance Which every citizen that loves his country Cannot deny to it. I would not at first Thy arbitrary impulses restrain. In this I greatly err'd: to shelter thee From that disgrace thou had'st incurr'd so justly, I suffered thee, without reproof, to spill Innocent blood; or haply if 'twere guilty, Blood spill'd by thee beyond all use of law. Too much I loved thee; too much was thy brother, Beyond the duty of a citizen. I welcomed the illusion, that the hate, The restless terror, and the dark suspicion, That always emulously agitate The irresolute heart of every man that dares To make himself a tyrant, tearing thine Little by little, yet for ever tearing, Would be too fierce a torment; and at once A spur to penitence ... In this I hoped, I hope it still; yes, brother, and dare more Conjure thee to it; by these tears unfeigned, These patriotic and fraternal tears, That thou beholdest coursing down my cheeks, And by the suppliant accents of a man That never trembled for himself, repent! The day at length is come; thou art arrived At that imperative and fearful point Between a tyrant and a citizen, From which thou must precipitately fly, Or everlastingly resign thy brother. Tim. Archidas speaks in thee: his sentiments I recognize too plainly! SCENE THE THIRD. Demariste, Timoleon, Timophanes. Tim. Mother, come; Ah! may thy intercession be availing To make my brother's heart somewhat relent. Timol. Yes, mother, come; and may thy intercession Avail to accomplish what my heart desires, The restoration of a real brother. Dem. Ye love each other; why let jealousies Disturb your friendship? Tim. His too austere virtue, Not suited to the times ... Timol. His too exorbitant And haughty wishes, worthy of the times, But not of one whom I would call my brother. Dem. But what, his power, not gain'd by violence, Can that afflict thee? He who saved his country, Wouldst thou have him amidst the lowest people, Degraded, undistinguish'd, obscure, nothing? Timol. What do I hear! Oh pestilential, fierce, Insatiable desire of royal power! How soon dost thou enervate every man Unfurnished with defence from lofty thought! How quickly does the insidious appetite For arbitrary power, in every heart, Tempted by fair occasions, root itself!â Is it excluded from thy heart, oh mother? Thyself a citizen, gav'st us our lives, Brothers and citizens; nor deemedst thou The name of citizen disgraceful then: In a true country born, thou fed'st us here, And in her service here thou brought'st us up. And hear I words within these walls from thee, Scarcely befitting the distemper'd weakness Of a despotic oriental queen? Tim. Mother, thou seest it; he twists all to evil. Hear how his indiscreet, fallacious zeal, Makes him insensible to nature's cries. Dem. How many times have I not heard thyself Revile this city? Its corrupted customs, Its venal magistrates ... Timol. But tell me, mother, Did'st thou e'er know me, e'en in words, prefer To venal magistrates, corrupted customs, A monarch absolute, and hireling troops? Oh mother, for your honour and for mine I will imagine thee yet innocent; And thee, my brother, more impetuous Than criminal. To what thy perilous schemes May lead thee, seest thou not? I then will be A light, a revelation to thy darkness. Thou yet hast time. A noble reparation, Worthy of a great citizen, remains; A sacrifice most generous ... Tim. And 'tis ... Dem. 'Twill be most surely a magnanimous deed, If in thy generous breast it is conceived. Reveal it to him. Timol. Thy authority, Which by abusing it thou hast made guilty, Spontaneously renounce it all. Tim. To thee I will renounce it, if thou wilt accept it. Timol. From whom hast ta'en it? From thy brother? Speak, Or from thy fellow-citizens? Restore Thy country to its rights; suspect not me Of perfidy. If any one but thou Possest this power, he long ago had lost it. Reflect, that hitherto with thee I've used Explicit means. Tim. Timoleon, I reflect That an authority the many gave, The many only can resume. The law, What I am now did constitute me first; Let those who framed it, abrogate that law, I yield at once. Timol. And dost thou speak of law, Where an audacious mercenary band Confounds the right by might? Tim. Would'st thou expose me, Defenceless, to the brutal turbulence, The envy, rage, revenge of Archidas, And others equally with him malignant, Whose fears alone restrain them? Timol. Be thou arm'd By innocence, and not by bullying braggarts; Nor make a pretext of the fears of others To hide thine own. If thou art innocent, Why fear? If thou art not, not only fear The rage of Archidas, but that of all;â âFear mine. Dem. What do I hear? Alas! I came To reconcile you both, and a new source Of animosity inflames you both To fiercer rage than ever! Woe is me! ... Tim. Mother, with thee I leave him. He, inflamed With too much anger, now could ill with me Contend.âBe our opinions what they may, Accordant or discordant, no dissent Can e'er obliterate from my constant heart The recollection that I am thy brother. SCENE THE FOURTH. Demariste, Timoleon. Timol. Behold a miracle! He who till now Was rage itself, who in his fervid breast Nursed flames more turbulent than those of Ãtna, Already is an adept in the art Of simulation; and smooths o'er his rage Now that he learns to batten it with blood. Dem. Son, but in this too greatly prejudiced, Thy mind deceives thee. Timol. Ah no! rather thou Art too much prejudiced; nor wilt thou see Objects most manifest and most pernicious. Mother, from thee afar I live; and 'twere, To make thy judgment sane, needful to thee To have me always at thy side. I was Once dear to thee ... Dem. And still thou art, believe me ... Timol. Thou should'st then love, as much as thou lovest me, Intrinsic glory. Emulously we Should try once more to gain it: from my brother I would remove an everlasting blot: I love him, far more than myself I love him; As much as I love thee. Thou hast much power To work upon his passions; and should'st try In a resolve to strengthen him, at once Magnanimous and indispensable ... Dem. To become private? ... Timol. To become a man And citizen; to disenthrall himself From universal hatred; to retrace Th'ancient forsaken path of real virtue; To be once more my brother; for as such Already, I no more acknowledge him. Mother, in vain thou flatterest thyself: Here truth, except I bring it, enters not. Ye live among intimidated slaves: And though embosomed in the heart of Corinth, Breathe not its air: here emulously all Applaud your cruel hardihood: ye hear Torments call'd justice; frantic outrages, Suitable punishments; audacious deeds, Preventive measures.âLeave your guilty dwelling, And ye shall hear an universal murmur, Cries, imprecations, menaces, and insults: Investigate the secret heart of each, And in the hidden chambers of each breast Ye shall find hatred, schemes of ruin: all Have sworn your infamy and massacre; And in proportion as general fear Delay the punishment, so much more cruel, Atrocious, merited, and violent, Shall it be poured on your devoted heads. Dem. Ah son! ... Thou mak'st me tremble ... Timol. For yourselves I always tremble. Do thou then, I pray thee, Take pity on thyself, on him, and me. I am so circumstanced, that every ill That falls on you with added weight is mine: But, at the same time, every injury My country bears from you is also mine. My heart is torn by two discordant feelings; I am a son, a citizen, and brother: Beloved names! no one knows how to prize them More than myself, no one more ardently Seeks to perform the duties they involve: Ah! put not to the test which tie o'er me Is most prevailing. I am born a Grecian; And thou, a Grecian, understandest me.â Thou seest me approaching the dire point Of being your avowed, fierce, mortal foe; Then yield belief to my remonstrances, While as a brother, and a son, I speak. Dem. Oh! what God speaks in thee? ... I will endeavour To make thy brother hear me ... Timol. Ah! depart Without delay; exert o'er him thy influence. If he no more unsheathe his bloody sword, 'Twill be, I hope, in time: to-day thou canst, And thou alone canst reconcile thy sons; Live with them joyfully beneath the shelter Of popular applause;âor disunite, And lose them, thus, for ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Demariste, Echilus. Ech. Oh mother of Timophanes, 'tis time That thou should'st feel regret for such a son: At last he has assumed without disguise The character of tyrant. Dem. What has happened? Where is he? Can I not retrace his steps? Ech. What? Know'st thou not? ... Dem. I know not; speak. Ech. Alas! By means of his corrupted satellites, He takes the life ... Dem. Of whom? Ech. In his own blood Weltering lies Archidas; the violence Is most notorious; in the public street Wounded he dies; nor from the mangled corse The impious murderers fly; ferociously The gasping, half-dead body they surround, And intercept all aid. Each passenger Affrighted flies, and scarcely dares to weep Inaudibly. He dies, that noble, just, Humane, and only citizen, who brought, To the degraded magistracy, fame. Timoleon sees himself in him bereft Of the unenvying rival of his virtue, His bosom friend, the only ... Dem. Ah! what tidings Dost thou relate? Oh heaven! now more than ever, Will peace betwixt my sons be interrupted; Perhaps 'tis for ever broken. Wretched me! ... What shall I do? Ech. Go where thou hast a right, And of a mother's power avail thyself. What reparation of a crime so great There now remains for him, I scarce can tell, That may suffice at once to mitigate The anger of his brother, and of Corinth: If he will make concessions, and renounce His guilty power, there may be hope e'en yet. Timoleon is his brother; I, by blood, And friendship, am too much united to him: We thence shall have unmerited aspersions; Yet perhaps still save him ... but if he have now Entirely hardened his perverted heart By his new arbitrary sway of blood, Tremble for him thyself. Dem. What do I hear? Ech. I, erewhile blinded to his dawning vices, Have been the dupe of his atrocious arts. Though late, I see that now the hour is come, When with him, my affection, conduct, language, All, all must change. Dem. Ah! hear him first, I pray thee ... Who knows? perchance ... I cannot blame thy anger ... Nor dare I to defend a deed so guilty; ... Yet some pretence, at least, of reason, must, To this, have driven him. Hitherto his sword Fell only on the guiltiest citizens: Tremendous, I allow; but to those only Tremendous, who, though impious, and blamed, Unpunished stood, refractory to law, Above all law, which, towards them, was mute: Such hitherto was he. Ech. If thou dost hear him, I fear that he will give thee arguments More guilty than his deeds. Dem. See; he comes hither. SCENE THE SECOND. Timophanes, Demariste, Echilus. Dem. Oh son; ... alas! ... what hast thou done, oh son? A deed, more fitted to confirm the blot Of tyranny, with which thou art aspersed, Could'st thou have done than this? All shudder at it; And, by it, thou hast forfeited for ever Thy brother's love. Alas! who now can tell What the result will be? ... Thy bosom friend, Echilus, even him thou hast alienated: Thou hast made thy mother also weep. Alas! Too true, too true it is, thou broodest over Both illegitimate and perilous schemes, Confrontest dangers imminent and ghastly. The bandage, which did blind me in thy favour, Thou, from my forehead, hast at length removed. Tim. Whence this extravagant and frantic grief? Wherefore? What evil can result to thee? Was Archidas by amity, or blood, With thee connected? I perceive it clearly, Thine is a borrowed grief. Dem. To me what evil? What evils to thyself may thence ... Ech. And ought Thence to result. Dem. Call'st thou the public hate, Which I am forced to share with thee, no evil? To have thy mother always trembling for thee? To gain the hatred of my other son? To see 'twixt you an everlasting discord? ... Tim. And must I hear you then, yourselves not vulgar, Judge with the vulgar? Do thou with thy words, I, by my actions, try to change my brother. Archidas had, so long as he had breathed The breath of life, in him, against myself, Hatred, and anger, evermore transfused: Yes, of my brother's fondness he usurped The better part from me. This finally, Among his many other crimes, appeared, To me, the capital delinquency. Ech. He was too patriotic, and too upright; This was his crime.âBut hast thou recollected, That to their country not exhausted quite, Timoleon and Echilus yet remain? ... Infatuate man! ... Ah! whither dost thou rush? I loved thee hitherto; how much thou knowest: I am yet faithful; and I thought thee so: And so thou wert with me at first; a friend Thou had'st in me, a friend I had in thee ... By blood alone we are united now; Ah spare, ah spare, this last remaining tie. Behold me, I am one that loftily, And loudly both profess and swear to be The bitter foe of simulated virtue.â Tim. Less fickle than yourselves, I do not change So suddenly as you my love to hate. Dear above every thing I held you once, And still I hold you: to regain my friend, And brother, every means I will adopt. Thy frank remonstrances offend me not: But yet I hope, now that I have removed The chiefest hindrance, to recover thee. As to thee, mother, I have long ago Fully convinced thee, that I would impose A more efficient government on Corinth. Let me not have to appease you all at once! ... Dem. I am offended for thy brother ... Ech. What? ... Art thou impassive as respects thy country? Dem. I am a mother ... Ech. Of Timophanes.â Dem. Of both ... Ech. No, of Timoleon thou art not. Dem. Thou hearest him? ... Ah wretched me! ... Tim. Permit, That I alone confront my brother's rage Before thou hear him. It would be to thee, To listen to his fierce rebukes, too painful. I promise thee by arguments to make Converts of these: no evil can result From thence to them: and, spite of his aversion, I will, that with myself Timoleon share That power, which now securely I possess. From me, do not thou, by thyself dissent: A blind love of thy country sways thee not: Thou lov'st thy children, thou. Leave me awhile; Perchance my brother will come here to me; I would convince him first: and afterwards Thou in our mutual joy shall bear a part. Ech. Is it so possible that he should yield, As that myself should yield to thee ... ah say: Art thou resolved, if he should not relent, To follow thy infatuated schemes? Think of it; speak ... Dem. âEchilus ... in my heart What horrible presentiment I feel! ... Ah! son, I pray thee; do not move at least A step from hence, of which I know not first. Tim. I promise this to thee: now go in peace: Nothing henceforward will I undertake Without thy approbation: live secure; I swear that I will not. I feel within me A certainty that I shall be ere long To thee the herald of domestic peace As well established, as our public grandeur. SCENE THE THIRD. Timophanes, Echilus. Ech. Timoleon has a heart more masculine: Thou wilt not conquer him, as thou hast done Thy mother, by her feminine ambition Conquered already. Tim. All the means, in me, Of conquering all, are placed: believe my words. Ech. Now thou dost speak at last; this is a language Precisely corresponding to thy deeds. At least I hold thee somewhat less degraded, Now that thou talkest as a tyrant should, And I, as should a citizen. I came Expressly to renounce thy amity. I grieve not that thou hast deluded me: Had I deluded thee, my cause for grief Were more imperious; spotless is my faith. Tim. I do not thus with levity renounce The ancient lofty ties of holy friendship.â Echilus, hear me.âI would fain convince thee, In spite of prejudice, that every virtue In me is not assumed, that rectitude May be allied to gratified ambition. If this my thought, to make myself the first, I kept from thee, if also I denied it, Had I to thee denied it; would'st thou thence Have trusted to my silence, or denial? Did a man e'er abandon sovereign power? Perhaps thou did'st err in making me thy friend, While thus I rose to greatness step by step: But thou would'st err no less, if thou should'st cease To be so, when my power is now so great. Ech. Then was the blood of Archidas decreed To manifest to me thy turpitude, Which hitherto I knew not? Can it be, That thou art thus in bondage to thy crimes? ... But if, oh heaven! I cease to be thy friend, I yet remain allied to thee ... Ah yes; By my beloved sister, in thine eyes Still precious; by those dear and tender babes, Of which she's made thee father: I beseech thee, On her, on them take pity, since for us, And for thyself thou feel'st it not. Not yet Is Corinth, as thou thinkest, quite struck dumb: A joy, alas! too transient, for thyself, Dost thou prepare; for us, eternal tears. Ah! hear me ... See, I weep; for thee I weep.â Thou art not yet so far advanced in guilt That every obstacle thou hast surmounted, Nor art thou innocent enough to fear none. Many more lives must yet be sacrificed, Ere thou canst fix the basis of thy throne; And perhaps the hardened guilt thou hast not yet, Required for such a process ... Thou beholdest; How I address thee as a man; methinks, That in thy bosom thou retainest still Some sparks of human feeling. Many steps, There are, from loving as I once loved thee, To abhorring thee: ... and it will cost me much To make the change ... Ah! force me not to this. Tim. Thou art the best of men; ah wert thou not The most deceived! But yet for this, oh no! I love thee not the less.âBut I behold Timoleon coming ... SCENE THE FOURTH. Timoleon, Echilus, Timophanes. Tim. Ah! grant thou to me, That first I speak to thee, one word alone. Thou shalt speak afterwards ... Timol. I deemed thou wert A tyrant, but at least a lofty one; But base as any other tyrant art thou. Fool that I was! Is there in all the world A tyrant of an uncorrupted heart?â I myself bring, to the sublime assassin Of each good citizen, one of the best That still remains: Archidas lives in me: Thou hast committed unavailing crimes; Collected Corinth breathes in me; in this Most free, most noble, energetic soul, Me, me thou slayest; thou art silent; now Nothing remains for thee to say to me; It only now remains for thee to kill me. Tim. Now, hear the new professions of a tyrant.â This my life is thy gift: thou, brother, thou Preserved'st it for me; resume thy gift: I am not hedged around by armed guards: Here is my dagger: plunge it in my breast. Behold I bear my bosom yet defenceless; No timid mail is there; secure I stand, Secure as thou.âWhy dost thou now delay? Quickly strike thou. The hate that in thy breast Thou cherishest 'gainst tyrants, in my blood Now vent it all: if thy just hate I merit, I am no more thy brother.âThis my power No man in all the world can now take from me: Thou, thou alone, and with impunity, Canst take my life. Timol. No, if thou slayest me not, Thou ne'er shalt keep that execrable power. Already art thou wallowing deep in blood; Wilt thou now halt midway? Proceed, proceed: Only through this my breast to Corinth's throne Canst thou ascend: there is no other way. Tim. I sit on it already, and thou art Unhurt. My city, and my force, I know; And I already have advanced too far Now to recede. There are none equal here To me, except thyself. 'Twould be in me Consummate infamy to make myself Again e'en less than my inferiors. Than thee, I may; and if thou wilt, I will. Trust me, that here, the hydra-headed monster Of popular freedom, ne'er shall rise again. To thee the government of one seems guilty: But, if exemplarily just, that one By practice might refute thy theories. That one, be thou; profit by my misdeeds; Thus Corinth, more than I have taken from her, In thee will reacquire; and I shall feel A pride in being second to thyself. Timol. Thy words with keener punctures wound my heart, Than could that dagger, with whose reeking point Thou hast restored my Archidas to freedom. Yet slay; slay on: but do not thou presume, To teach the arts of arbitrary sway, Or servitude, to one by birth a Grecian. Successive tyrannies alternately Have, it is true, disfigured every state Of this clime sacred to the cause of freedom: But here has blood been always cleansed by blood; Nor has the sword of vengeance ever slumbered. Tim. And let the traitrous sword come when it may, And fall upon my breast: but, while I breathe, Corinth and Greece shall see, that, evermore The sway of one is not corrupt: shall see, That a prince raised by bloodshed to the throne, Can make his people happy with wise laws; Each man secure; internal peace enjoyed; His subjects' fear enhancing their obedience; Strong in himself, the envy of his neighbours. Timol. What would'st thou teach us? are not kingly crimes To all men known? Does not degraded Asia Exhibit every day their dire effects? 'Tis of that soil a plant: there it takes root; There less than men it makes men; banished hence It makes the Grecians like the gods themselves. We are the loftiest people of the earth.â What dost thou covet for thyself? To be A king exempted from the lot of kings?â Of every good man thou art now the foe, And wilt be more and more so; of each virtue The invidious contemner; flattered, feared, Abhorred; to others an exceeding burthen, A torment to thyself; unworthy praise Evermore craving, in thyself convinced That thou deservest only execrations. Fears in thy heart; restlessness in thine eye; Of apprehension, and suspicious thoughts Eternal prey; an everlasting thirst For blood and gold, and never satisfied; Deprived thyself, of what thou takest from others, Sweet peace of mind; to no one in the world By blood and friendship joined; of fettered slaves, The still more fettered lord; the first in rank, The least in heart of all ... Ah! tremble; tremble: Such wilt thou be: if such thou'rt not already. Ech. Ah! no; the pure divinity of freedom Never yet breathed into a mortal heart Words more divine, more warm, more true, more strong. Already by the fury, that transports him, Is my full bosom seized. Canst thou resist, Infatuated man, a portraiture, At once so accurate, and horrible, Of the impious life, in which thou'rt plunged? Tim. âAh! perhaps, Ye speak the truth.âBut now there are no words, Strong howsoe'er they be, that can avail To wrest me from my purpose. It is past, For ever past, the time for me to be A faithful citizen. My master passion, My sole, immutable, and lofty wish To reign, is now become my whole of life ... Brother, I have already told thee so: Thou canst alone correct me by the sword; All other means are vain ... Timol. And I to thee Repeat it: thou shalt never have the sceptre, Except thou kill me first. Ech. And me with him. To that fond friendship which I had for thee, I feel already in myself succeed An ardent, strong, atrocious enmity. Yes, thou shalt find in me an enemy No less embittered, fierce, implacable, Than I was once a friend both fond and hearty: And recollect, that I am not, like him, To thee a brother.âIn the tyrant's presence I here meanwhile to thee, Timoleon, swear Eternal fealty of blood. I swear By thy side, for my country, to confront The worst extremities: and if at last Our labours should be vain, I further swear That I will not survive her one brief moment. Timol. Behold, thou mad and criminal aspirant, If so much be resolved by one that is Thy bosom friend, and also bound to thee By ties of blood, what will so many others, Incensed by thee, perform? Tim. Enough, enough; I fain would have you friends; but fear you not As my opponents. Now exert yourselves For her, ye generous champions of your country. SCENE THE FIFTH. Timoleon, Echilus. Timol. Ah, ill-advised, infatuated brother! Could I save thee as I feel confident To save my country! Ech. In his mercenaries He does confide; he knows that other troops Corinth has not now to oppose to his. Timol. With this last massacre he has contrived To intimidate the people; but their hate A thousand times he has augmented thence; And he has not in every heart extinguish'd Courage, and resolutions of revenge. Already by a secret embassy Sent to MycenÅ, have the people sought Immediate aid: his very satellites In part are disaffected. Wretched man! In his own snares he will be surely caught! ... Ah! were there yet a remedy! ... But he Has robb'd me of my friend, and, dearer far, My liberty ... But yet, ... he is my brother; Yet do I pity him ... Could any one Somewhat persuade him ... Ech. This his mother might, Were not her heart corrupted: but too much ... Timol. She also for the last time now shall hear me. Ere I do this, I fly to supplicate My friends, that they alone would grant him, What of this day remains, for penitence; Forthwith I shall return; and every means, That he may change, will I in turn adopt; Entreaties, tears, fear, menaces, his mother.â Ah, come thou also; let us means contrive By which the uplifted sword may be awhile Suspended o'er his head, and yet no loss His country thence sustain. Let us to-day Render to him the latest offices Of friends and relatives: but citizens, If this avail not, are we, and shall be Constrain'd, though weeping, such to prove ourselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Demariste, Timoleon. Timol. I come to reap the harvest of thy judgment. Since last I saw thee Archidas alone Hath fall'n assassinated: thy discourse Hath hitherto much check'd thy haughty son: Now certainly thou hast entirely changed And mollified his heart: that which in vain My ineffectual and fraternal words, The universal cries, the general tears, Friendly reprovings, and the bitter pangs Of a remorseful conscience, sought to effect, At last have been achieved by the absolute, And virtuous intercessions of a mother. Dem. ... That I applied myself to this effect With strenuous warmth, I call the heavens to witness; But is there any rock that may compare In hardness with the bosom of my son? He hath imbibed the poisonous draught of power; Nor are there prayers, or tears, or arguments, Of force, that now can change him! I with thee Was here conversing, scarcely had he left us, When he inflicted a tremendous death On Archidas. After such deeds as these, What avail words? I spoke in vain; still more Timophanes persists ... Ah thou! who art Humane and wise, do thou awhile then yield To irresistible impetuous power: Perhaps afterwards ... Timol. Lady, to me speak'st thou? Dem. Alas! ... If thou dost not, what will befall us? ... Ah! hear me. Would'st thou see him massacred? Or would'st thou, that by force a turbulent, Frantic ambition now should drag him on To crimes more heinous still? His state from thine Is too dissimilar: of too much blood He is already guilty, that he now Should live securely were he stripped of power. Now is it indispensable that he Supply with power the forfeiture of fame. But thee, who art arm'd in complete innocence, Calm reason may convince: and I may find Thee a more facil listener. His power, His honour, perhaps e'en life itself, all, all, If he should yield himself to us, he loses: Thou, if to me thou yieldest, losest nothing ... Timol. What infamous conclusions! Callest thou Thy country nothing? nothing my renown?â Art thou my mother, thou?âIf he should cease To be a tyrant, for his life thou fearest?â But tell me, thinkest thou that he can live, Provided he persist to be a tyrant? Dem. Oh heaven! ... Every word of thine breathes vengeance! Fierce to thy brother art thou, while for thee He is all love: while he would have in thee, In thy intelligence and lofty heart, His country live; and that magnificence Which he in time of war bestow'd on her, He wills, that now she should receive from thee, In time of peace, in more abundant streams. And this he swore to me ... Timol. And dost thou yield Belief to words (or be they true or false) Always corrupt? Thou shouldest know, methinks, That I'm a citizen, and not the city. The country lives in sanctimonious laws; In upright magistrates, its ministers, And not its masters; in the multitude, And in the great; in uncorrupted votes, And in the union of these suffrages; In an incessant and pervading freedom That makes all equal that are so in goodness; And, more than all, the country's life consists In the fix'd hate of individual rule. This know'st not thou?âIt was the highest insult That could be shewn me by yourselves, to dare, Or feign to deem me the confederate Of tyranny in you.âAnd, lady, thou Art equally convicted with thy son, By signs conclusive: it is clear to me, That less it pleases thee to be the mother Of me, a citizen, than of him, a tyrant. Dem. 'Tis clear to all, that, as thou canst, I cannot Divest myself of love for my own blood; That I am evermore a mother ... Thus Wert thou a brother! Timol. Oh what mother art thou? The Spartan ladies, that which mothers should be, They teach thee in their austere commonwealth. The effeminate fondness of a partial woman Is thine, miscall'd by thee, maternal love, Making thee yield thy son's intrinsic honour To his unprincipled and headstrong pride. Behold the Spartan mothers, in their sons Rejoicing, for their country sacrificed; Counting their wounds, and washing, kissing them With patriotic, not lamenting tears; And she that is of most sons destitute, By stately grief ennobled, move along Most dignified in aspect: these are women, Women, and citizens, and mothers, these. Thou to thy son's inflexible intent, Although thou know'st it criminal, dost yield: And dar'st thou say to me, and dar'st thou hope, That I should also yield to it? Ah why To my still more inflexible intent, Which thou dost know to be the child of virtue, Dost thou not rather yield? For him alone Dost thou ejaculate a mother's name; For me suppressest it? Dem. Ah, calm thyself; Hear me, Timoleon ... What have I not done? And what have I not said? ... I am aware That on thy side is reason; but thou knowest That force, which listens to no arguments, Combats for him ... Timol. No, mother, no; by words Thou hast done little, and by deeds still less, Nay, nothing. Have impassion'd sentiments Inflamed thy heart? That patriotic fire That gives new courage to the weakest breast? Which had inspired thee with an eloquence Imperative, ferocious, masculine. In thy antipathies and sympathies, Timophanes, believe me, craftily His hopes hath founded: he discovers clearly How much the fascination of a throne Flatters thy sickly appetite. Say, mother, Has he e'er heard thee thunder forth in tones Of lofty menace? Has he ever heard thee ... Dem. As far as might a powerless mother venture, I have presumed; but ... Timol. Was a Grecian mother Ever incapable, or ever powerless? Thou hast, more than thou meritest to have, Effective arms; if thou neglectest them, Thine is the fault. If he to prayers, and tears, And arguments resisted, thou thyself Shouldest have banish'd hence (for this abode Is thine) the scandalous, pestiferous train Of tyranny; have taken from thy son The sources of corruption; taken from him, Ere aught thou tookest, weapons worse than swords, The master key of all base passions, gold. Did not thy consort's last and sacred will, Do not the laws of Corinth, render thee The absolute disposer of our substance? Dem. 'Tis true, I might have spoken ... but, if ... Timol. Thou should'st have acted, not have spoken, mother: And if his guilt arose to such a pitch As to contend with thee, why didst not thou, With hair dishevell'd, weeping, and in weeds Of widowhood, tearing thy breast and face, Depart from this contaminated roof? And in thy hand, at thy departure thence, The children of thy son thou should'st have led, Themselves not guilty for their guilty sire; And with them should'st have dragg'd their weeping mother, A grateful spectacle of ancient virtue To all good citizens: have shelter'd thee And them with me, thy true, thy only son, And to himself the tyrant have abandon'd, Amid his bullies and his parasites: Not accessory to his usurp'd power Have loftily proclaim'd thyself; and thus Have taken from thyself the horrible blot Of being his accomplice.âThis didst thou, To such exposure could he have resisted? ... Surely he scorn'd that which he well might scorn, Imbecile tears and female lamentations. Dem. My son, ... I fear'd ... Ah! hear me ... Timol. He should hear thee ... Dem. I fear'd to exasperate his cruelty, By thus defying him: I turn'd to thee, And still I turn to thee, to whom an evil, Still greater than to him, might have ensued; To thee ... Timol. Thou fearest? If fear be thy guide, If fear in thee must now usurp the place Of patriotic love, know thou that ruin, Irreparable ruin, over him, Not over me, impends; and that this day, This day alone, if thou would'st have him saved, Remains to thee ... Dem. What do I hear? ... Alas! ... Timol. Yes, but this day, now verging towards night ... I love my brother, but I love him, mother, With a far different love to thine; in heart I weep for him, although with thee I weep not. I speak to thee with this ferocity Because I love you both ... For Corinth now No more I fear; ... I fear alone for you. Timophanes unwarily confides In his bribed mercenaries ... Ah, my mother, My last petitions now I raise to thee. I supplicate thee for my brother's life, If thou dost hold it dear. I now alone Over his head myself suspended hold The citizen's retributory sword; I add, I only, to the tyrant's days A single day: I that first ought to wreak My vengeance in the life-blood of the tyrant, I, ah disgraceful weakness! I preserve it. Take warning from my words, and be persuaded That Corinth has not yet so much incensed Her guardian deities, is not beheld By them so inauspiciously, that yet They would to one man's arbitrary will Annihilate her high prerogatives.â Behold the tyrant. I no more accost him; I have said all to him that I can say.â If ill result, blame thou thyself alone. SCENE THE SECOND. Demariste, Timophanes. Tim. Timoleon avoids me? Dem. Oh my son! ... Tim. Has he so much disturbed thee? Hast thou not Subdued him yet? Dem. Oh heaven! his words were death To my sad heart ... Tremble; one day alone, This only day, remains to thee ... Tim. I tremble? 'Tis now too late; now that my enterprize I have accomplished. Dem. How art thou mistaken! ... Perchance, without thy brother, thou hadst not Been living yet ... Tim. Dost thou so much despise me, That thou expectest to obtain by terror That which to prayers I will not yield? I speak More openly than he does: no light proof Be it to thee of this that nought I fear.â All their contrivances I know; I know, That, coward foes, they now betake themselves To arts in vain. They also have their traitors; Assistance from MycÃ¦ne they expect In vain; in vain have they corrupted some Of my arm'd followers: all is known to me; Their steps, their thoughts, their plans, I know all fully. I do not think that I shall yield to them; But, should that happen, I will ne'er recede; No, never. Had they openly opposed me, I should have blamed them less; but they have had Recourse to fraud. That fraud shall be their ruin. Dem. Alas! ... art thou so much unnaturalized That e'en thy brother ... Tim. He asperses me With tyranny; but yet, much more than he, Am I a son and brother. I would give My life, at any time, to rescue his: If I select him from my other foes, Thou thence may'st judge. Echilus and himself, From the universal slaughter now decreed, Alone shall be exempt ... Dem. Dost thou yet speak, Oh heaven! of further slaughter? What's thy purpose? Pause, I command thee. To thy detriment Too long have I been silent! My connivance, My silent condescension makes me guilty; Timoleon's indignation towards his mother, Alas! it is too just ... Tim. My destiny Is irreversibly decreed: the throne Or death.âIn vain thou art incensed; in vain Thou supplicatest, weepest, menacest. I have already issued the command Of death, and for my brother fear alone; For military rage is ill controul'd. Be it thy task, thou mother of us both, To make him fly from all assemblies: ah! Exert thyself to the utmost to persuade him Beneath our roof to shelter. From his mouth I never learn'd his stratagems: to him Tell mine, as far as may be requisite For his protection. I am apprehensive Lest he should still persist to seek the place Agreed on with Echilus: here alone He will be fully safe ... Dem. And should I yet Avail to entice him hither, wretched me! When of the slaughter he shall hear ... perhance ... Oh terrible day! ... he then will breathe revenge ... Tim. When he shall see that I would spare his life, Perhaps he may change: but also he may slay me: And let him do it; he alone may do it: This life he may resume, since once he saved it:â But to retake from me this throne which I Gain'd for myself? not heaven itself could do it, Except it first reduce this frame to ashes. SCENE THE THIRD. Echilus, Demariste, Timophanes. Ech. Be not amazed if thou yet seest me; Behold the countenance of a generous foe: And the first dart, that I direct against thee, Is the unforced confession, that e'en now A mortal blow is falling on thy head. Dem. Ah son, I cannot leave thee! ... At thy side I must remain ... thou yieldest ... Be convinced By this brave man ... Oh heaven! ... what art thou doing? ... Tim. Against each dart my breast is mail'd in steel. I fearlessly await you. Ech. Hear me: never Was I more frank with thee than I am now; My heart addresses thee; nor is that heart, Because I am thy adversary, changed, Save for the better: valiant though thou be, Thou art but one; unwary is thy trust If placed on others: thou art beset by death In thousand shapes: many as are the swords That thou seest round thee drawn in thy defence, There is not one of them which suddenly May not be turn'd against thy breast. Ah! trust To me alone; or change, or slay, or tremble. Tim. Resign me to my destiny. This day, Which ye announce to me as so tremendous, Will not be spent ere ye will be convinced Of your mistake: nor will it then to you Be unacceptable, to find that pity, Of which to me ye now are so profuse, More efficacious as another's boon. SCENE THE FOURTH. Echilus, Demariste. Ech. Thou wilt then have it so? I have discharged, Far beyond thy deserts, to thee my duty. Dem. Ah run! Bring here Timoleon: I would fain Impart to him great tidings. Each assembly Persuade him to avoid: he is in danger. Watch over him ... I tremble ... Bring him here, At all events, or, ere the night descends, He will not be secure elsewhere. Ah, go; Have pity on a mother; save one son; I fly to make the other more relenting. SCENE THE FIFTH Echilus. Ech. What perturbation! oh! what horrid secret Beneath her accents lurks? ... Oh heaven! ... And whence In the fierce tyrant so much confidence? Perchance he knows our schemes. Perchance ourselves Are by his very traitors now betray'd. All his flagitious plots his mother knows; And more she trembles for her other son? Then has the impious tyrant in his heart Determined now to inflict a final slaughter? ... Ah! If it should be so? ... Let me fly hence; And be the illustrious Timoleon saved, In whose salvation is the country saved; Or, for her, one with him, let us all die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Timoleon, Echilus. Timol. Now it is night, why drag me here? Ech. Ah! come: Thy mother thou shalt hear ... Timol. What shall I hear, That I already know not? Ech. She would see thee; To thee great tidings ... Timol. And thou darest perchance With her unite now to deceive me? Ech. I?â What I projected, thou this instant heardest. But to save thee! And that is now accomplish'd. Timol. What sayest thou? Saved from whom? Explain thyself. Ech. Pardon, if one thing I concealed from thee. Timol. Ah! perhaps thou hast presumed? ... Ech. Be not offended. Words so ambiguous from thy mother's lips I erewhile heard; such insuppressive fear For thee I witnessed in her trembling heart; Her importunities were so excessive That I should bring thee here, that, at all risks, I was resolved to do it. On our colleagues I feared some lofty danger was impending; This I concealed from thee; I was too sure, That if I told thee this, on no conditions, I could detach thee from them. Timol. What sayest thou? Darest thou to make this execrable dwelling Thy shelter in an universal danger? Oh! thou beginnest ill ... Ech. I will atone By a more worthy end, I swear to thee, For such beginning: but, I wished thee saved. Timol. Now, what then knowest thou? ... What is the danger? ... Ech. Little with certainty I know; but all I fear: and the audacious countenance Of the secure Timophanes to this Compelled me; and the evasive conscious aspect Of the irresolute and trembling mother. Those satellites of his, bribed by our gold, That undertook to watch his stratagems, And give us warning of them, are, at once, Detected, and destroyed. None now remain In whom we may confide. The place appointed For our assembling likewise is discovered. Timol. âOh fatal day! ... Oh apprehended day! ... At last art thou arrived?âWe are betrayed, Assuredly betrayed ... Our fortitude, Our patriotic constancy, to-day, Must undergo a stubborn scrutiny. We never were constrained, as we are now, To prove the mettle of our ardent spirits; And what is worse, we never were constrained, As we are now, to practise artifice. Ech. I hastily dispatched to all our colleagues The tidings, that, except with risk of life, To-day, we could not meet. I think with pain That, to a messenger perhaps insecure, I gave the charge: but brevity of time, And earnestness to rescue thee the first, Made me incautious. Timol. Every man ere me Thou should'st have rescued. And what better fate Could crown my wishes? With my falling country, I should have fallen: what wish I, but death? Why save me? ... To what dire vicissitudes Do I remain? Ech. Thou now art placed in safety; And we should save our country. Let us now Hear Demariste. Timol. âAn accomplished tyrant Already is Timophanes: to thwart All schemes; to tyrannize o'er every soul; As he is terrified, to terrify; All, all, he knowsâ Ech. But yet he knows not how To foresee all things. Timol. Desolate! ... Ech. He wills it; Himself would have it so: of all my pity He has divested me. Oh heaven! Who knows? ... Perhaps now our faithful colleagues ... Timol. Two of them, Two of the most courageous, at a distance, TimÅus and Orthagoras, I saw Coming towards us: but I made to them A signal to retreat. Ech. Thou erredst. Why Did I not see them also! Timol. We suffice, If we come here to death. Ech. We are too many, If we are forced to an unwilling vengeance; But, by their means, we might perchance have warned Our other colleagues. Timol. Why hide aught from me? 'Twere best now to depart ... Ech. Some one approaches, Or so it seems to me: hear'st thou? Timol. I hear it; They are a lady's steps: perchance my mother ... Ech. 'Tis she. SCENE THE SECOND. Demariste, Timoleon, Echilus. Dem. Ah son! ... oh joy! ... Once more I see thee. What a distinguished and compassionate kindness, Echilus, hast thou rendered me! I see My son once more ... and to thee do I owe it. Timol. Whence such excessive joy? Hast thou avail'd To make the tyrant's stubborn heart relent? Say with the noble universal joy Of ancient freedom dost thou welcome me?â Ah no! for yet I see in thy demeanour The offensive mummery of regal pride. In what exultest thou? Ah thoughtless woman! ... Dem. That I behold thee, and once more embrace thee. I feared that thou would'st never more direct Thy feet to my abode ... Timol. It is not thine, But the abode of sorrow, of imposture; Or 'tis not her's at least who is my mother. Perchance thou now hast summoned me to thee That I may lead thee hence? Oh come; to me 'Twill be a triumph to regain my mother; 'Twill be to me an animating omen That I shall afterwards regain my country. Dem. And dost thou still so cruelly persist, Oh son? ... Timol. Oh mother, dost thou still persist Thus to contract thy heart? Hast thou aught else To say to me? Dem. I would say to thee; but ... Timol. Thou darest not; I see it.âBut already Thou, by thy silence, hast expressed far more Than I would hear.âAnd what is this? Thou tremblest? ... I understand, thou art a queen: thou art The mother of a tyrant. Nothing now Remains for me except to answer thee. Thou art worthy here to dwell, and here to die. There was no need to summon me for this: Thou knowest that I am no more thy son.â Echilus, come; from this infected roof Let us depart. Dem. Ah no! ... Pause yet a little ... Thou must not quit us. Timol. Leave me: I will go, Nor evermore return to you. Disgrace, Exile, death, torments, I would rather bear Than ever see the servitude of Corinth ... Echilus, let us go ... Ech. 'Tis Corinth's will That we should now be here; thou oughtest not To stir from hence ... Dem. Thou canst not do it now. Timol. Who hinders me from doing this? SCENE THE THIRD. Timophanes, Demariste, Timoleon, Echilus. Tim. Perhaps I.â That force, which brother may with brother use, I now exert towards thee. Let me embrace thee; And let me render thanks for thy deliverance To fate, to heaven, Echilus, and my mother. Timol. Thou of fresh massacres hast then been guilty? ... Ah yes! I see in thy unquiet looks Recent destruction. Cruel that thou art! ... âIll hast thou done to save me. Tim. We are all Now in a place of safety; where no one Can injure you, nor you can injure me. Timol. Reflect, reflect, cannot we yet to thee Be ministers of good? Tim. Yes; by a quick, And unreserved submission to my power; Yes; by yourselves being the first to give Others the example of obeying me. Ech. Obeying thee? ... Timol. We first? ... Tim. Yes: since thou art Unwilling to divide with me my power. Perchance if ye had been avowed opponents, To you I might have yielded. Openly I dealth with you; this my sincerity Should have made you sincere ... Timol. Thou didst at first Usurp authority by fraud: this done, 'Twas easy afterwards for thee to be Audacious in thy insults. Force, with thee I should at first have used, and never art, To reconvert thee to a citizen. Ech. And did not I with a loud voice of sorrow Proclaim myself to thee an enemy? And that, although not girt by satellites, Although alone, and destitute of power, We should be fatal to thy usurpation? And that thou oughtest evermore to guard Against ourselves? Were we, or are we now, Less generous than thou? Tim. Thou saidedst it; And now an ample recompense to you From hence results. From this last massacre I would exempt you only, and ye are so. Thus your ingratitude more signally It pleased me to confound, and not disturb The joy of my new government.âFeed not Your flattered spirits with fallacious hopes. The gloomy shades of night which hitherto Were wont to veil your criminal assemblies, Yes, of those shades, these now have been the last To your insidious friends. In vain to them Your warning was dispatched; it never reached them; That very place sacred to traitrous deeds, Where they clandestinely assembled, is, To all of them at once, become a tomb. Timol. What do I hear? Ech. Oh heaven! ... Tim. And these are they, Your traitrous letters to MycenÃ¦ sent; Behold already they return: and he, To whom they were addressed, is also slain. Would'st thou have more? those two conspirators Who, clad in arms, wandered around my threshold, TimÅus and Orthagoras, have found, Also, a death deserved.âWould'st thou have more, Survey around thee, and thou wilt behold Obedience, blood, and terror; nought besides. Why dost thou longer now delay to yield Thyself to me? What canst thou do to me, If thou wilt not yield? I have well convinced you That ye are now my sole remaining foes; That I have rendered you to every one, Not less than to myself, contemptible. Timol. Thou never should'st have spared our lives alone. This I again would thunder in thy ears: Thou hast done nothing if thou slay'st not us. Ech. Hope never to recover us as friends. Nor flattery, nor time, nor force can do it ... Timol. Nor can my mother, as I see her now Stand silently, and full of pride and shame. Ech. Hold us not in contempt. First against me Let the executioner direct thine axe. Thou hast not yet drunken of kindred blood: Taste it; the trial will be grateful to thee:â Nor any other blood remains, for thee More indispensable to spill, than mine. Timol. Slay me the first of all. In sparing me Thou dost but offer me an added insult. Thou hast snatched from me each most sacred thing: I am, with everlasting infamy, By thy means laden: why delay? destroy me. Tim. No, on your obstinate hearts I will inflict Severer punishment: upon the throne Beholding me; and thence obeying me. Timol. âHast thou resolved then not to take our lives? Tim. I have resolved to hold you in contempt. Timol. Art thou resolved to reign? Tim. I reign already. Timol. Ah wretched me! ... Such is thy will ... At least Let me not see it. He covers his face with his mantle. Ech. Die then, tyrant, die. Dem. Oh heaven! ah son! ... Tim. Ah traitor! ... I ... expire ... Timol. Give me that sword: my country now is safe. Ech. Ah! for thy country live. Dem. Secure him, guards ... The guards crowd round Echilus.Run ... to the traitor ... Tim. Mother, no. Timol. Give me That sword; ... In me ... Ech. No, never ... Tim. Guards, retire; 'Tis my command: ... Let no more blood be shed. Dem. Echilus dies ... Tim. Let no one be the victim ... Expressly I forbid it ... Hence: I will it. The guards retire. Dem. And thou; oh cruel, and unnatural brother ... But thou, oh heaven! thou weepest? Tim. I would have The throne or death: but yet, at the same time, I wished to save thee, brother ... By thy hand, Which rescued once my life, I should have died: Death so inflicted would have been to me Less painful ... Ech. He, not I, was born thy brother: To him the signal rightfully belonged; To me belonged the blow. Dem. Oh parricides! ... Ye; that he would not slay ... Tim. Do not, oh mother, Longer upbraid him thus. In him already Affliction is excessive; from his eyes The tears, in torrents, gush.âI pardon thee, Oh brother; do thou pardon me. I die The admirer of thy excellence ... If I Had not attempted ... to enslave ... my country; ... I had attempted to deliver her: 'Tis the most glorious ... of glorious deeds ... Yet I see clearly that a frantic love Of glory did not prompt thee to this act; The purest feelings of a citizen Impelled thee thus to sacrifice thy brother ... To thy protection I commit my mother ... And do thou ... mother ... recognize in him A real son; ... a being ... more than mortal.â Timol. He dies! Alas! ... Thou, mother, didst by force Constrain me to come hither ... Oh, my brother, Soon will I follow thee. Ech. Ah! ... Dem. Son! ... Timol. For what Do I now live? For weeping, ... for remorse ... The avenging furies in my burning breast I feel already ... I shall never more Enjoy a peaceful thought ... Ech. Listen to me: Thou should'st not now refuse the first assistance To thy sick country ... Timol. I would hide myself From every human eye; and shun for ever The insufferable light of day ... I ought To die of sorrow, if not by the sword.â Dem. Ah wretched me! ... Oh heaven! ... What can I do? ... One son is gone for ever ... and the other Scarcely remains to me ... Timol. Oh mother! ... Ech. Come, Let us withdraw from this heart-rending sight.â Timoleon, thou should'st now convince the world, That thou didst slay the tyrant, not thy brother.</field>
