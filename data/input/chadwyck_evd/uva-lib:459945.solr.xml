      <field name="fulltext">TO The RIGHT HONOURABLE The Earl of Burlington.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE. Whene'er Lucilius, as with sword in hand, Lash'd with his pen the monsters of the land, The hearer's, and the reader's, cheeks were spread With conscious blushes, as their crimes were red, The practicer of vice, the canker'd heart, Felt, from the secret guilt within, a smart; Yet with their virtue loss'd they not their shame; Nor punish'd him from whom the satire came. IN modern times, where rule is held by might, Where will is law, and law must pass for right, Where impious men consult their private gain, And not the glory of their prince's reign, Speak not of men unfaithful to their trust, Tho spoke of nations ages pass'd in dust; A word draws vengeance on an author's back: O! name not darkness; for their deeds are black! THESE scenes the woes of no exalted state Present, nor satire to alarm the great: Here love and friendship share an equal part, To call soft pity from the tender heart: The pious tear here filial duty sheds, And weds awhile to sorrow when she weds; Her virtuous griefs, by love supported, flow, And find relief alone from Cupid's bow.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Young Freeman and Charlotte Briar. Young Freeman. Why, Charlotte, hangs this melancholly on thy brow? Why droops my love? Why droops my ev'ry flow'r Compris'd in one? Why on this happy day, Indulgent to our wishes, wilt thou unkindly thus indulge unseasonable sorrow? Why on this day on which the pious man Has join'd in wedlock's bands the hands of two Whose hearts by love were long before united? Charlotte. Ah! Freeman! there's the thorn that goads my side! I confess, since first our mutual vows we plighted, I thought each day an age till I secur'd you mine; and, now I have obtain'd the purchase of a thousand sighs, I have a thousand fears of losing you. Y. Freeman. And whence arise those fears? From no distrust, I hope, of one whose honour's dearer to him than his life, of one who places you in the same ballance with his life and honour. Charlotte. No, my much lov'd, and ever honour'd, husband, I can not entertain a thought of ill of you: but think— I'm Briar's daughter. Y. Freeman. Thou art the lovely'st rose that ever blow'd. 'Tis true, the difference that has long subsisted betwixt our fathers has been the cause of our concealing our passion from them, and of our clandestine marriage: But, shou'd dissention reign among our parents, And everlasting strife be sow'd betwixt them, Yet shall our loves immaculate remain. Banish all dismal apprehensions from your mind; Our loves perhaps may take a happyer turn, And be the cement of perpetual union Betwixt our present jarring familys. I know my father's ever gentle nature Is prone to pardon injurys, and to excuse The little failings of unwary youth: He looks not with the rigid eye of age, But always makes such favourable allowances as the wise and good shou'd make: in short, I know his greatest pleasure is to communicate to others what happyness he can. Charlotte. Wou'd I cou'd say as much of my unhappy father! Unhappy I may truly call him; for, such his temper, he has no friends but his own poor little family, my mother and myself; and when we tell him, as we do with trembling, of his moroseness, and his ill-judg'd pride, he frowns upon my mother, and with a surly voice bids her be gone, and crys you'll make the girl as foolish as yourself: but, my dear Freeman, let me intreat you to inform me what was the cause of this long difference betwixt our parents; for I cou'd never learn but an imperfect account of it at home. Y. Freeman. 'Twas on a tresspass; for which we offer'd ample recompence; but, that being rejected, a suit of law commenc'd: your father has already been at more expence than he is able to bear: my father propos'd to make a neighbouring gentleman, a person of known worth and integrity, the arbitrator, and to abide by his judgement rather than go on to feed contention for the advantage of the lawyers only; and this was the day appointed for the arbitration. Charlotte. Heav'n make it fortunate; for upon that, I fear, our fate, or mine at least, depends. Y. Freeman. Your fate depends on me, and mine on you. Charlotte, so close our hearts are rivetted, That he, who wou'd divide us, must in the separation draw the life-blood of both.—I see my father coming this way: retire, my love, beneath these shades, while I learn what the arbitration has been, and the consequence of it, and while I try the tenderest of parents with a relation of my passion for you: as he receives that, I shall hereafter tell him the secret of our marriage. Charlotte. Success and everlasting love be with you. (She retires. SCENE II. Freeman senr. enters. Freeman senr. I greet thee, Lewis, with a father's love; And, whether 'tis design, or chance, that throws thee in my way, I always count it gain to have thee near me, My son, my best companion, and my friend. Y. Freeman. I owe you, Sir, more than is barely due to a parent: not once in five and twenty years I've seen the hand of rigour o'er me. What I remember of my infant days Were all with pleasure and with fondness crown'd: While at school, I thought I chang'd one father for another, if I was to judge from the tenderness of my master; which I imputed, more than to any merit of my own, to the strict charge my loving father gave concerning me. At college pleasures flow'd on me, in a thousand streams, From the rich fountains of old Greece and Rome: And now the social Virtues of the best of fathers present to me all that I cou'd wish to meet with in a friend. Freeman senr. If these are your sentiments, as I have no reason to think they are not, I am bless'd beyond my expectations in a son. Thou art the harvest of my life's long toil; And the rich crop rewards my labour well. Y. Freeman. As your peace, Sir, is one of my first concerns, I shall be glad to know how the affair betwixt you and our neighbour Briar is determin'd. Freeman senr. To my content, tho to my cost: Mr. Weldon, our friend and arbitrator, propos'd paying half Briar's expence in the suit, which he has litigiously carry'd on, rather than see contention betwixt two neighbours kep'd alive: the generous proposal was applauded; but I chose to pay the whole myself, hoping by that to purchase a quiet neighbour, a friend he is incapable of being: the man is poor, and seems to hate me for no other reason but that I'm more successful than himself? Y. Freeman. Weak man that can indulge a temper which makes him wretched! 'Tis planting thorns and brambles in his breast! Poor lovely Charlotte, how much unlike the stock from which you sprung! Freeman senr. What maid is that whom you nam'd in such tender terms? Y. Freeman. 'Tis Briar's daughter, Sir. Freeman senr. I thought it was the same. Come, Lewis, deal with me as a friend, to whom you had sworn inviolable truth and confidence; and you shall find that open heart, and unreserv'd regard, which you might reasonably expect from such a friend, who had plighted the same faith to you. Tho I have weather'd thro near fifty years, I have not yet forgot what the soft passions are; and I mistake if still I cannot read the language of the eyes. I observ'd, when you nam'd the maid, That change of countenance, and change of voice, Which tell me that your bosom has receiv'd A guest that you desire to entertain: If it is so, communicate to me; And give me no room to complain of a reserv'dness in you which you shall never find in me. Y. Freeman. No, be my love my curse, if e'er I wrong So good a father, and so true a friend: There are some errors pass'd; but, by the friendship which you profess to me, I beg you wou'd not now enquire into them: what I at present ask Is your consent to prosecute my love: That she is fair all who have eyes can tell; And she is chaste as is the falling snow: She has such virtues to adorn her life, As in themselves will be an ample dow'r. Freeman senr. I've often seen the girl, and mark'd her well. And I must acknowledge that I think your passion can not paint her more beautyful than she is: And, by the sacred name of him that cloaths The earth with beauty, and the sun with light, Was she as poor as is the sun-burn'd wench That stoops to take the gleanings of my fields, I wou'd myself perform the father's office, And give her hand to thee, so much does Freenan's happyness depend upon his son's. Y. Freeman. Then may that son ne'er know the sweet possession of his love, if ever willingly he gives that father pain. Freeman senr. Yet, my son, methinks there is a bar—Nay, do not start: it is not such a bar as shall obstruct your love, but may awhile delay the sweet possession. You know my family is but of a low beginning: my forefathers seem never to have been more than poor inhabitants of Kent, the humble tillers of another's land; and all my heritage was the long lease which has been oft' renew'd from son to son. When I was young the neighbours were pleas'd to cry my person up; and I always had, what I always strove to deserve, the character of an honest man. Your mother, whose fortune was five thousand pounds, was marry'd to me against the consent of her friends: her father was a gentleman: on that she has too much presum'd; but I, who knew that words cou'd ne'er infect my meat or drink, bore the woman's foolish vanity, as I wou'd the chattering of the daw, ne'er contradict it: but to the purpose more: I doubt your mother's pride will make her start objections to the match; but it never shall obstruct it wholly: all that I mean is, for her peace, to use some art to draw her gently in to give consent. I'm going home; and there I'll break the secret to her first: you perhaps are going another way: my blessing is ever with you. (Freeman senr. goes. SCENE III. Charlotte comes from beneath the shade. Young Freeman. Thou best of men.— Come forth, reveal thyself thou happy bride: Come from the covert; I'll pursue my chace; And thou, my lovely game, shalt ev'ry morn Wake with the waking day to happyness. My father views thee with a parent's eye: Now let the bus'ness of our lives be love. Charlotte. I hear'd him pass the joyful sentence on me: My task is now to come: My father's great necessity may prove My greatest blessing; for, so well I know him, If he was able to bestow on me A portion equal to your own, He'd sooner match me far below myself Than let me be the wife of Freeman's son. Y. Freeman. Come, my Charlotte, we'll go to him together; Together we'll present ourselves to him, The tenderest, the most loving, pair that ever plighted vows. I'll save my charming bride from the confusion Of telling the soft story of her passion: I'll be myself the orator of love, And tell our tale in such a moving strain, As, was his heart wrap'd in Siberian snow, Shou'd melt his frozen breast: I'll paint a prospect of such happyness To us and to himself, As, was he savage as th'Hyrcanian tyger, Shou'd bribe him to our Interest. Throw into future hours, my love, thine eyes, And see what scenes of bliss before us rise; The fields, the painted meads, and chrystal streams, And groves, indulgent all to lovers' dreams; Where peace for ever dwells, nor enters care, And Love the little god that governs there. The End of the First ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Briar's House. Briar and Charlotte. Briar. Yes, Charlotte, yes, my child, to make you happy, I'll curb my rage, I'll bridle up my hate: The bitter indignation that I bear To Freeman is not level'd at his son: I will love him, my girl, for loving you. Charlotte. O! may your days be long and pros'prous all! He surely is the sweetest, gentlest, youth, That ever trod the plains, or woo'd a maid! Briar. Daughter, I must confess I did not think 'twas in the pow'r of words to throw my temper into such a mold as the young man has fram'd it to: His language found a passage to my heart, And made me wish the son of Freeman well. Charlotte. What do my eyes behold? my Freeman's mother! Come, I suppose, to bless me with her voice. I shall grow mad with joy. Briar. Ah! does the proud dame once condescend to enter Briar's roof! SCENE II. Mrs. Freeman enters. Briar. This unexpected visit, Madam— Mrs. Freeman. Is on no slight occasion, neighbour Briar—My husband has inform'd me of my son's addresses to your daughter— Briar. And you wou'd make us sensible of the great honour you intend us. Mrs. Freeman. An honour that's too great for you or her. Briar. Good woman, have a care: be not too presuming. Mrs. Freeman. How! is this your language to your landlord's sister? Have not you and your fore-fathers been, time out of mind, the vassals of my family? Briar. Tenants we've been, and always pay'd our rent, Tho' we've been poor:—but, Madam, to the purpose; Whate'er it is, tell it in words as plain As is the man to whom you speak. Charlotte. O! my poor heart, on what a wreck thou'rt thrown! (To herself. Mrs. Freeman. Then plainly my design is this, to tell you that your thoughts soar much above your low condition. Whate'er my son's misguided love may be, or whate'er his father's resolution is, your daughter is no wife for Mrs. Freeman's son. Look round about you, and you soon may find a husband for your daughter among the labouring honest hinds of Kent: or if, my wench, you chuse a single life, perhaps I may prefer you, when young Freeman marrys, to be his lady's waitingmaid. Charlotte. Whatever is my lot, Eternal blessings be on Freeman's head. (She weeps. Briar. Waste not a tear my child.—Woman be gone; Civility to thee wou'd be a crime. Know that my daughter, cloath'd by nature's hand With beauty, and adorn'd with modesty And truth, wou'd grace thy family With such a picture of the female sex As never yet it saw. Mrs. Freeman. I tell thee, man— Briar. I tell thee, woman, I will hear no more. Yourself was the first cause of my hatred to Freeman's family, Which encreas'd with time, and now is fix'd, Fast as the roots of oaks, in Briar's heart: O! cou'd my imprecations influence heav'n, Mildews shou'd blast thy corn, a murrain seize On all thy flocks and herds; but on thyself What curse wou'd I draw down! A long old age, deformity, and cramps. As for my child, she shall this day be sent Where Freeman's son shall ne'er behold her more. Away, my ears are deaf to your reply. (He thrusts her out. SCENE III. Charlotte. My father, my ever honour'd father, do not break the heart of your much lov'd, and ever loving, daughter, in your resentment to a haughty Woman. Briar. Did she not treat that daughter with disdain? If I forgive her, may ev'ry curse I wish'd to fall on her fall on myself and mine.—If you're desirous of a father's love, forget young Freeman. Charlotte. Impute not to my Freeman a fault that's not his own: I dare engage, for him and for his father, that neither gave consent to what she has done: she follow'd, unknown to them, the dictates of her pride and settled hate. Briar. Then from that pride and settled hate shall grow Plagues which shall taint her ev'ry hour of life. How fruitful is an angry mind of thought! I've now conceiv'd a vengeance that I'll take. I'll send you forthwith to your uncle; whose care of you will equal mine: he has a son, Who long has view'd you with a lover's eye; Whose honesty and industry will make you A joyful mother and a happy wife. Charlotte. O! name no husband for your child but Freeman: I have a reason, Sir, which I cou'd give, That wou'd disarm you of your rage, and change Your resolution.—Alas! what can I say? If I tell him of our marriage, it may enrage him more. (To herself. Briar. Absence, my child, is a certain cure for love: the dayly intercourse of new and different objects will, by degrees, drive those ideas from your mind which now perplex you, and, in due course of time, obliterate all traces of your present love. Believe a father that instructs you from the experience which himself has had. Charlotte. Here comes my advocate; to whom I fly for refuge; and in whose breast I must repose the secret of our marriage. (To herself. SCENE IV. Mrs. Briar enters. Charlotte. My dearest mother, help to break the storm that's low'ring over me. My unkind father, tho he means me well, is taring me from all that I hold dear on earth, except himself and you, from my lov'd Freeman. Mrs. Briar. With the submission of an humble wife, I do intreat my husband to recollect the vows he pay'd to me. Had I, when of our daughter's age, been torne from you, I shou'd not now, so well I know my heart, have liv'd to intercede for her to you. Briar. The woman's always contradicting me. Do'st thou imagine that thou lov'st the girl better than I do? or do'st thou think thyself more wise and able to contrive her good than is thy husband? Mrs. Briar. I neither think myself so wise and able to contrive as you; nor do I think my love exceeds your own for our dear child: but I think I know the workings of her tender heart by what I well remember to have felt myself for you. Briar. Tho you do thwart my will, I cannot hate you; for you have always been a good and an obedient wife. Charlotte. Heaven give her words success! (To herself. Briar. But if I once resolve, your words are spent in vain; they pass Like gentle winds over the standing corn, Ruffle the ears, but leave no trace behind. My brother's son shall make her a happy bride: I'm going to prepare her for her journey: do you prepare the girl to bear it well. (He goes. SCENE V. Mrs. Briar. Charlotte, if once your father is resolv'd on any act, all arguments to him are as if we shou'd endeavour to argue down a storm or northern blast: submission therefore, if you can submit, to his paternal will, is all the remedy I can propose. Charlotte. Are you against me too? While he was here, you pleaded for your daughter; and now wou'd you persuade me to that which you oppos'd when he was present? Mrs. Briar. I wou'd persuade you to your ease, my child: and, if there is a way to shun the match your father has propos'd, you're sure of my assistance, while I can act consistent with the duty of a parent and a wife. Charlotte. Then I've some hopes. Let us retire into your chamber; and there I will relate to you the secret which I fear to tell my father. There I'll describe to you the lovely'st youth, That ever fill'd a virgin's ear with truth, Whose love and honour are his only pride; And I'm his faithful and his maiden bride. (They go. SCENE VI. Freeman's House. Freeman senr. Mrs. Freeman, and Y. Freeman. Y. Freeman. 'Tis cruel, Madam, 'tis unmercyful, to torture thus the heart of an obedient and a tender son; but I'll complain no more of your unkindness:—and did her father say she shou'd be sent where Freeman never shall behold her more? Mrs. Freeman. He did, and loaded me with bitter curses. Y. Freeman. Charlotte, I come once more to try the art of soft persuasion: the fabled task of him who mov'd the rigid king of hell to gain his wife is now impos'd on me. (He goes. SCENE VII. Freeman senr. I've borne too long the froward temper of a headstrong woman: this is too much to bear. Mrs. Freeman. What have I done to make you treat me thus? Near thirty years I've been your virtuous wife, And never had reproach from you before. Freeman senr. And therefore you've presum'd upon my easyness of temper: 'tis true, You've never had reproach from me before; And much I wish you never had deserv'd it. Ungenerous dame, look backward to the day In which I first engag'd my love to you, And say if you can call to mind a moment In which I ever cross'd your purposes. Your beautys, whose attraction once was great, Have never suffer'd but by the hand of time: Care never prey'd upon your rosy cheeks; Nor have your eyes e'er met an angry brow From me till now: your inclinings I always with a lib'ral heart indulg'd: Is it therefore kind, or honourable, Thus to proclaim an open war with me, To fight against my will in an affair On which depends The whole felicity of a lov'd son? Mrs. Freeman. What I have done— Freeman senr. By your own confession what you've done is wrong. After I told you of our son's settled love for Briar's daughter, and of my own approbation of his choice, what but a spirit of malignity cou'd drive you on to break a match, which seems to be the chain that holds the life and safety of your son? Mrs. Freeman. The honour of my family's concern'd: Why shou'd my blood contaminate itself, By mixing with so low and vile a race, If I am able to prevent the evil? Freeman senr. That pride Shou'd thus survive the mem'ry of your love! Presume to talk of family no more to me; That has been bandy'd in my ear too long: Our currents, which have thirty years been join'd, Make but one stream in him. Have you forgot That your son's case was once your own? If you have, I'll wake that nature in your breast which you Shou'd ne'er have suffer'd to have sleep'd. Mrs. Freeman. I never saw this rage in him before. (To herself. If I have acted wrong, You need not tell me of that wrong in thunder: I can receive rebuke, or hear advice, If you deliver it with a softer voice. Freeman senr. You've been unus'd to my rebuke, and deaf to my advice: when therefore the peace, the interest, of my family's concern'd, I must not, as in slight affairs I've done, Suffer your pride and humours to direct, Where honour, and where wisdom, shou'd preside. Mrs. Freeman. I see my error, and repent sincerely my late misdoings. (To herself. Your former lenity and tenderness Convince me of your goodness and your love: And your resentment in a cause so just Speaks the resolution of a manly mind, To which my weakness ought always to submit. If you'll forget, or if you can forgive, All my pass'd conduct which has giv'n you pain, My future life shall all be pass'd In humble resignation to your will, And in submission To your superior wisdom and your pow'r: And may my life be long with you, that I May earn your pardon By a long practice of obedient love. Freeman senr. Divested of your pride, and cloath'd with this humility, You are as lovely to my eyes as when I led you blushing to the bridal bed, 'E're seventeen summers Had call'd the full-blown roses to your cheeks. To-morrow I'll go myself to treat of my son's marriage: this night I will devote to you. Wou'd woman learn what is her lovely'st dress, She'd not by grandeur strive to make her less; She wou'd not wish to make admirers gaze At the rich tissue, or the di'mond's blaze: In humble beauty cloath'd, her best attire, She'd either keep alive, or wake desire. The End of the second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Briar's House. Freeman senr. and Briar. Briar. Your son was here last night: I told him plainly then my resolution: my daughter is no wife for him. Freeman. Once more I tell you that what his mother did was all unknown to us. Briar. It may be so; yet shall my child ne'er be subjected to her ungovernable pride; Who, in her peevish moods, wou'd ev'ry day Upbraid her with her father's lowlyness, And sour her meals with tart unkind reproaches; And who wou'd let her know that all she wears Is but the badge of charity. Rather Than match my girl to wretchedness like that, I'd throw her on the barren heath to dwell In a poor homely hut thatch'd by the hands Of her laborious husband, whose dayly toil Shou'd be their chief support, while she at home Plys, from the morning to the ev'ning sun, The spinning-wheel, In the coarse garment which herself has wrought. Freeman senr. Nor this, nor that, needs be your daughter's lot: My wife repents her late rash act, And wishes now to call your child her own. Briar. Which she shall never do: I thank her for her visit; for by that she shew'd me what a fury my poor child has escap'd. SCENE II. Young Freeman enters. Young Freeman. With the respect Due to the fountain of my Charlotte's life— Briar. Young man, this visit is as fruitless as the last: your father's and your own persuasions no more can move me than can contending winds remove a mountain. Y. Freeman. Sir, you mistake me; I come not to intreat, but to demand. Restore to me my wife, my virgin wife, Whom yester's sun beheld In wedlock's sacred bands to Freeman join'd. Briar. O! this is well! first you rob my fold, And then, with an undaunted face, demand The lamb that I've re-taken from the thief. The negligence with which you've treated me, By marrying my daughter Without so much as asking my consent, Shews me in what mean light you place her father. You thought, as I suppose, That there was no necessity to ask A poor unfortunate parent his assent To wed his dow'rless child: he doubtless, you believ'd, wou'd thank you: but know, unthinking youth, this disrespect throws thee as far from my regard as is the west from east; and, if I'm able, I'll part my daughter from you As far asunder as the north and south. Freeman senr. Hear me, rash man: perhaps the sentence that you pass on him devotes yourself, your wife, and child, to misery: here stands a father wrong'd, as you call yourself: I was no more consulted in the match than you; yet I forgive it; for 'twas a fault of youth, a fault of love. Y. Freeman. This was the first occasion I ever gave my father to complain, and shall be, if I know myself, the last. I wish that others wou'd learn from you humanity and prudence. Briar. Let them forgive who will, I'll not forgive: Perhaps I'm wrong, yet, while I think I'm right, Tho I am wrong, I will be so. You may As well attempt To make the gallant steed a patient ass, As try to frame my temper to your own. Freeman senr. I wou'd be your physician, and cure you of that phrenzy which seems to hurry you on to your destruction. You are on a precipice, and see it not; and I wou'd fain prevent you from taking the fatal leap. Briar. Thou solemn and profound philosopher Reserve your sage instructions For those who will be thankful for your pains. Y. Freeman. I blush to see my father condescend To plead so much in vain, and I the cause: Pardon me, Sir, That I have brought this weight upon your head; Lose no more words on that ungen'rous man. Cast the rich seed upon a barren rock, And thence expect to reap a fruitful harvest. Since you have stop'd your ears to mild persuasion, I tell you, man, You can as soon drive from the stars their brightness As from my Charlotte's thoughts expel her Freeman; Where-e'er she is, she will be always mine; You may as easyly make vice and virtue one, as prevail on her To give her heart or hand to any other: She is my wife, More lov'd by me than by the eye the light, Or by the ear than is the charmer's voice: I go, but I shall come to you again, And make you render up a true account Of the great treasure you withhold from me. Briar. Know I can threaten, friend, as loud as you. Tho much I love my child, Yet there is nothing that I will not do To keep her from you: so be gone; I hurl Defyance after you. Freeman senr. You may repent too late. (Freeman senr. and Y. Freeman go. SCENE III. Briar. —Going towards the door. What ho! you clod of earth, you walking piece of dirt, Go call your mistress hither, tell my wife Her husband wants her here.—It is resolv'd: Young Freeman and my daughter have not yet Consummated their marriage: without delay Charlotte shall therefore wed my brother's son. SCENE IV. Mrs. Briar enters. Briar. What have you done? Have you prevail'd upon the Girl To bear her parting with a patient mind? Mrs. Briar. No: Freeman has lay'd so strong a hold upon her heart, That neither you nor I can tare him thence. Briar. 'Tis her first love; and it must cost some tears. The girl is young, and therefore flexible: That softness, on which with ease Freeman impress'd his love, may, by judicious hands, be molded to another shape. Mrs. Briar. It will be very hard, I fear, to find An object that can drive him from her breast. The youth is lovely in his person, and is, By her account, possess'd of ev'ry art To captivate the soul of innocence: He has such virtues, and such qualitys, Which ever must, she says, secure the heart He has won. Briar. You seem to dwell upon his praise with pleasure: That's not the end for which I sent for you. What?—You, I suppose, indulge her in her commendations of him: are those the means you use to make her think of him no more? Mrs. Briar. Reproach me not with faults of which I am not guilty. —I have exerted all the authority which a mother ought: I have us'd all the persuasions which I think are just: yet I wou'd not use authority with cruelty; nor wou'd I persuade my child to that which may make all her future life unhappy, and make that life perhaps but short. (She weeps. Briar. This is a plot against me: you are in Freeman's Interest I see. You practise on me with your pray'rs and tears. You did prevail last night; and I consented that she shou'd stay; but it was with the hope that you wou'd not abuse the indulgence which I shew'd, and that you wou'd endeavour to bring her to obedience to my will.—However, now I'll ease you of the task: the journey is but short, I'll to my brother's go with her myself, and see her marry'd before I leave the place. Mrs. Briar. If ever I found favour in your eyes, or if I ever have deserv'd your love, hear me this once, hear a tender mother and a faithful wife. Briar. Be quick; I can not hear long speeches now. Mrs. Briar. This once, and I have done. If to your brother's son you wed our child, You marry poverty to beggary, And make the girl a slave, a wretched slave, Match'd to an abject clown that she abhors: Think therefore, for I know you love her well, How you can bear to see her live a poor Unhappy wife, a stranger to content! And if her life's cut short, which heav'n forbid, By grief, how will you then bedew her cheeks With tears, with fruitless tears! Now turn your eye, from this dark dismal prospect, To the fair scene which Freeman's love presents: The husband of her choice will crown her days With tenderness and joy; and we perhaps May share their fortunes as we share their love. Distress, that seems approaching to our door, May by this match be drove entirely from us. I've done; and now The language of my heart has pass'd my lips, I'm all obedience to my husband's will. Briar. Thou tenderest mother, and thou gentlest wife, That ever bless'd a husband and a child, Lead in thy silken bands this savage man. Stand there; And let me view the treasure of my soul, To which I never ow'd a restless night, Or an unpeaceful day. Fortune may throw her keenest arrows here, While you, the dear physician of my mind, Shall heal the wounds and bruises which they give. Now, by that high providence that gave thee to me, I wou'd not for all Freeman's wealth, nor for the wide possession Of ev'ry fruitful hill and vale in Kent, Give up the title that I have in thee. Come, my sweet monitor, my humble guide, Now you've subdu'd my heart, direct my hand; For I'll this moment write to Freeman, And offer your proposals for the marriage. My guardian angel I behold in thee; And now methinks with other eyes I see: So great the change, another man I move; And all my heart is tenderness and love. (They go. SCENE V. Freeman's House. Young Freeman and Mrs. Freeman. Y. Freeman. You may as well Call back the blushes to the faded rose, Or bid the drooping lilly raise its head, As ask a smile, or cheerful look, from me. Mrs. Freeman. Why will you indulge this melancholly To the destruction of a parent's peace? Y. Freeman. Ye pleasant hills, and ye delightful vales, Ye painted meads, and love-sequester'd shades, Which oft' have witness'd to my happyer hours, Farewel, the goddess of the scenes is fled! The bright inspirer of my heart with joy Is gone, and left me to despair and woe. Mrs. Freeman. Hear a fond mother that wou'd fain apply A remedy to your distemper'd mind. Y. Freeman. But why unjust do I accuse the maid! Can the eye wish to bar harmonious sounds The entrance of the ear? Or is the ear Desirous to deprive the eye of sight? Charlotte, whose happyness depends on mine; Can never join to wreck her Freeman's heart. Mrs. Freeman. How may the folly of a moment lose What can not be recover'd in an age! What miserys have I brought upon myself! Y. Freeman. Hark! is not that the charmer's voice afar, That crys, come Freeman, haste to rescue me, And snatch me from the snares which now surround me! I come, O! nymph divine, to seize my right, Resolv'd to bear away my lovely prize, Or perish in th' attempt. (As he goes towards the door Charlotte enters. SCENE VI. Young Freeman. Ah! is the cloud that hover'd o'er my head So soon dispers'd! It is; And the gay sun breaks brighter on my eye. See! the dear angel of my comfort comes! Say, heav'nly fair, tell me, thou faithful bride, By what assisting pow'r you broke the toils Which my foes pitch'd for you, and shun'd their hands To find your constant and your tender mate? Charlotte. I wanted, and I sought, no pow'r but love To guide me to you: soon as I saw We cou'd not change my father's resolution To tare me from you, I conceal'd myself, Waiting till night had spread her friendly shade That unobserv'd I might escape, and fly To you for succour; which if you deny me, I have no refuge but in death. Your gentle father, when I enter'd his hospitable gate, met me and took me kindly by the hand, and with a tender smile say'd, welcome thou lovely guest, go in, and find one that will give you as much comfort as you bring to him. Y. Freeman. Yes, You shall find comfort and a welcome here: I'll be the castle of my love's defence; My father and my mother both shall join To guard the outworks; and no pow'r on earth Shall force you from me. Mrs. Freeman. Excuse my child what yesterday you hear'd. Fall from my tongue; and believe that heaven cou'd not send A guest more welcome to me than yourself. SCENE VII. Freeman enters with a letter in his hand. Freeman senr. Hail happy pair; And may your days be many in the land, And ev'ry day be happyer than the last. The storm that held ye from the wish'd-for shore Is lay'd, and an unruffled calm succeeds. Y. Freeman. Bless'd as I am, I'm sure my father brings Some heav'nly tydings to enhance my joy. Charlotte. As from a Night pass'd in uneasy dreams, I see the dawning of a cheerful morn. Freeman senr. Here, Lewis, take and read it to your wife; And pour into her ear a balm that soon Will reach her tender heart, and cure what pains May still be lurking there. Young Freeman reads the letter. SIR, The ills of fortune, and the reasonable persuasions of the best of wives, joined with the warmest affection for my daughter, have brought me to a just sense of my error in opposing a match on which alone depends the felicity of my dear child. I do not presume to make any proposals: I give her to you and your family: and I shall give myself contented to the grave, whenever my days are expired, being satisfyed that I háve made her happy by this last act of mine. My heart is now divested of all enmity to you: may your happyness encrease with your years, whatever is the future lot of Your humble servant Briar. Charlotte looks into the letter. 'Tis my dear father's hand, and blessings on him! I know he always lov'd me; and by this act he has convinc'd me that I'm the first in his affection, when his cool judgement sways. Excuse my tears; for they are tears of joy. Y. Freeman. My Charlotte, See the big tear hangs on your Freeman's eye. This unexpected change in your father Commands my admiration and my love: I'm restless till I clasp him to my breast, And let him know how much he shares my heart. Freeman senr. I'll rise to-morrow with the sun, and pay An early visit to my brother, And greet him truly with a brother's love: The ills of fortune Which he complains of I will soon remove: I will prevail on him, and on his wife, That fair example of connubial love, To come and pass the joyful day with us. The merry bells shall wake the cheerful morn, And call the neighbours round to Freeman's hall; There shall they feast, and quaff the plenteous juice, Wishing the lovely bride and bridegroom joy. My wife and I will, with unsparing hands, Attend our welcome guests, and let no want Of nuptial merryment disgrace the day. Mrs. Freeman. A grateful office has my husband chose For his obedient wife, whose ev'ry day Of all my life to come shall shew my children That I've no happyness without their love. Y. Freeman. Now, Charlotte, thou art mine, and I am thine, By ev'ry ty of duty and of love. What to our parents do we owe? Our lives, And what's more precious, that our lives are bless'd. When o'er the spacious globe my eyes I throw, And view the various sons of pow'r below, Or him in Pekin's walls, where wisdom guides, Who o'er unnumber'd tribes in peace presides, Or him at Ispahan who proudly reigns O'er gaudy millions and extended plains, Or him for whom the sun intensely shines, And ripens for his pride the di'mond mines, The great Mogul,—or mighty Othman's state, On which a thousand eastern beautys wait, I wou'd not change, to be of all possess'd, The lovelyer empire of my Charlotte's breast. The End of the third ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A Garden. Young Freeman and Charlotte. Y. Freeman. This morning's sun shines on the happyest husband That ever yet possess'd a lovely bride. The author of our beings and our joys Gave us a taste of paradise to come In the rich transports of the bridal night. Behold, my love, the splendid eye of day Looks o'er the hills in brightness all aray'd, While at our feet the flow'rs send up their sweets, And ev'ry tree, and bush, is melody, As if all nature hail'd us to our bliss. Charlotte. I'm surely bless'd beyond the lot of wives: I cou'd say much upon our happy state; But you have spoke; yet all that you have say'd Falls short of my conception of my happyness. Y. Freeman. Hide not a blush, a blush the morning wears. With what delight I feast my ravish'd eyes, While ev'ry touch fills all my veins with pleasure! Charlotte. I've not a want, my dearest Freeman, now, But my poor mother's and my father's smiles; Which I shall soon behold; for your good father Went early out to seek the wish'd-for guests, And bring them hither. Y. Freeman. Swift ye minutes run, And give to my embrace that honour'd pair, To whom I owe the spring of all my joys! In this dear bosom of unrifled sweets Is all the treasure of my soul repos'd. SCENE II. Weldon enters. Weldon. There stands a friend, so much he shares my heart, Whose peace I value equal to my own; Yet must his ears receive a tale from me That to his early joys Will prove like blightings to the budding flow'rs: But 'tis a tale that, if I shou'd not tell it, He soon must hear from a less friendly voice: And tho it may 'e're long seem strange that I Shou'd chuse to be the bearer of the news, Yet 'tis an office that becomes me well, Because I shall, With the same hand with which I give the wound, Pour in a balm to mitigate the pain. (To himself. Joy to my Freeman and his charming bride; And much I wish that I cou'd give ye both More comfort than I bring. Y. Freeman. Welcome the dear companion of my youth, My much lov'd Weldon: thou art come, my friend, To share And to encrease the pleasures of the day. Thus plac'd betwixt ye, I've the best reward That honour can expect, Friendship in one hand, in the other love: But, methinks, my friend, You wear a sadness in your countenance, That suits the present hour but ill. Weldon. I've at my heart A burden that I must unload to you, And you alone: and, tho the season Seems but ill chosen for a task like this, It must not be delay'd. Forgive me, heav'nly bride, if I exact From you what hard necessity requires, And from your side, For some few moments, take your faithful mate. Y. Freeman. Go in, my love; and there expect me soon; Thou beauty that art always in my eye! Charlotte. Whate'er my beauty is, my only pride Is plac'd in my obedience and my love. (She goes. SCENE III. Weldon. Freeman, we've long been friends; and, when at college, We have often turn'd Together o'er the philosophic page; Thence have we learn'd that true philosophy Consists in bearing ills inevitable With the same patience as we'd view a storm, Or hurricane, Which are not in our pow'r to stop or lay. Y. Freeman. So well I know my friend that I am sure He wou'd not bring a trifle to my ear Prepar'd with such solemnity as this. Speak what you have to say; I am resign'd. Weldon. I'm glad you are; for you have much to bear. Y. Freeman. What can affect my peace? My Charlotte's well, And she is mine; My father, and my mother, all are well: As for our goods of fortune, were they less Than what they are, they'd be enough for me: But hold, I now begin to doubt my pow'r: If the sad story that you have to tell Is of the sorrows which you bear yourself, I shall break in Upon the joys which I propos'd to day, And mix my griefs with thine. Weldon. I've giv'n that advice I scarce can take. Your tenderness for me makes me already Anticipate the anguish to myself Which you too soon must feel: However, resolve to bear it like a man; And be sure I will not leave you In the distress with which I shall o'erwhelm you, But keep a stretch'd out hand, Till I have pull'd you out, or sunk with you. Stand firm; be ready for the stroke. Y. Freeman. I am You see a sturdy oak that well will bear The buffetings of the contending winds. Weldon. Within this hour I saw your father seiz'd, and haul'd to jail. Y. Freeman. At that I'm more surpris'd than terrify'd: The action must be forg'd, he's not in debt; Nor is his credit so low, or he so little lov'd, as to be unable to procure him bail. Weldon. This is but as a gale that only moves The leaves, and has not force to shake them off: This you bear well; and, as the winds arise, Keep steady as the oak, and fortify Your mind with resolution.—The charge against your father is no less than murder. Y. Freeman. He never cou'd delight in blood, but rather wou'd spill his own to save another's: yet, go on, and tell me who's the murder'd person. Weldon. Give me your hand; and stand against this blast, And you may bear the rest.—Your Charlotte's father is dead. Y. Freeman. Murder'd by whom? not by my father; for, since your arbitration of the difference betwixt them, they were friends, And by the strictest bonds which cou'd be bound: There's in our familys so great a change, That all our hearts are one. I have some hopes That the report of Briar's death is false: How hear'd you it? Weldon. I saw him breathless, and besmear'd with blood, And saw your father, after he was seiz'd, And hear'd the charge against him, With ev'ry circumstance attending it. Y. Freeman. Let me lay my hand upon your friendly arm; and tell me each particular of this mysterious melancholly tale. Weldon. Briar was found, In his own fields, dead and besmear'd with blood, And in his side a wound, your father by him, And in his hand the staff that gave the blow, The iron spike at the sharp end of which Was cover'd o'er with blood, and, as they try'd, Exactly fill'd the wound. Y. Freeman. This is like thunder from the hand of heaven; And I must yield to it. (He sinks down. Weldon. Rise, my friend; and tho my words may seem at present like a face that's veil'd, yet credit what I say: Briar indeed can never be restor'd; but your father, tho he must thro a heavy suffering pass, shall, like a vessel in a dreadful storm expected long to sink, safe reach the land at last. Y. Freeman. That's some relief to my dejected soul; But Briar is no more; and that's enough To heap on us intolerable woes: But tell me, Weldon, make me, if you can, Sure that my father's life is not in danger. Weldon. I have conceiv'd how I can safe that life; And rest assur'd, if one of us must sink, 'Tis I'll be drown'd: enquire no farther of me. Y. Freeman. My trust is all in you; yet I foresee The remedy itself must be severe. SCENE IV. Mrs. Freeman enters. Mrs. Freeman. Was ever pleasant morn o'ercast like this! O! my lov'd son, for much expected joy, Aray yourself with sadness and despair. I have receiv'd Such fatal tydings as I dread to tell. Y. Freeman. They have already reach'd my ear, and pierc'd My heart: but I've a friend Who, while he plung'd me in a sea of woe, Lifted me up, and bad me cherish hope; And, like the wretch just ready to be drown'd, I'm glad to catch at any twig that offers. Madam retire, and leave to us to guide The shipwreck'd bark thro such a storm as this. What comfort I can bring you My honour'd mother may be sure I'll give. Mrs. Freeman. Talk not to me of comfort; I'll have none; For none do I deserve. O! cou'd I but recall the hour in which my pride drove me to Briar's house, contented I'd meet death in any form; for my fears tell me that the visit, which then I made, may be the secret spring of all The miserys in which we're now involv'd. O! look not on me with an eye of love! For your rash mother merits all your hate: But you may spare reproaches; for my thoughts Are scorpions to me; and my burning brain Almost deprives me of the pow'r of thinking. Y. Freeman. Add no fresh griefs To those which now are scarcely to be borne. O! my poor Charlotte, what hast thou to feel! Mrs. Freeman. The torrent has o'erwhelm'd that lovely flow'r; Which I committed to the care of those Who will not be unmindful of their charge. Y. Freeman. That charge be only mine. SCENE V. As he is going Charlotte enters. Charlotte. Where's Freeman? Where's my husband? Are you here? Give me my father.— Is this the joy, is this the paradise, The nuptial boon which, with a thousand sighs And glowing kisses, you promis'd me?—What? Sent you your father out to murder mine? Know that the wound of which my father dy'd Has kill'd your wife. Y. Freeman. O! think that ev'ry tear my Charlotte sheds Draws from her Freeman's heart the sanguine drops. Charlotte. O! O! (She leans on him and sighs. Y. Freeman. Yield not, my love, So much to grief; for ev'ry sigh you fetch Flys to my breast, and does the dagger's office. Sorrows flow on me in too full a tyde; And much I doubt my pow'r to stem the torrent. Weldon. Speak comfort to her; for she seems to faint. Remember what you promis'd, that you'd bear The buffetings of the contending winds. Summons up all your spirits; and disdain To droop; For now's your time most to exert the man, Whose bus'ness is to prop that falling flow'r. Y. Freeman. Soul of my soul, look up, and see, in me, A father, husband, lover, and a friend. Heav'n surely trys us with afflictions soon, And checks us in the high-day of our blood, Lest, with too great share of human bliss, We shou'd grow wanton, and forget its pow'r. Charlotte. Then heaven shou'd give us strength to bear a trial so severe. When I behold you, when I hear you speak, I can not think you wou'd be accessary To such an act as curdles all my blood, And turns me almost to a weeping statue. Y. Freeman. Turn, turn, your eyes on me; and here repose Your ev'ry sorrow, and your ev'ry care; For here alone you must expect relief. (He turns to Weldon. With how ill a grace, my friend, I strive to administer comfort, Who want a comforter so much myself. Weldon. That you shall have in me, confide in me. Charlotte. My father! O! my father! Y. Freeman. Your father's death is yet a mystery Which to-morrow will unveil. Charlotte. To-morrow will not give me back my father: Methinks I hear him cry, Charlotte, my child, Fill not the arms of him whose barb'rous sire Imbrued his hand in the same blood of which You was a part: and must you be obey'd? That too is hard: My Freeman is not guilty: O! my heart! Weldon steps betwixt young Freeman and Charlotte. Thus I divide ye, till to-morrow shews On whom the guilt of Briar's death must fall: If Freeman's innocence appears, then meet, And make each other's happyness your care; But, if he's guilty, sever'd then remain For ever. Y. Freeman. Hold; that is unfriendly urg'd: the terms are too severe: the guiltless for the guilty must not suffer; that is repugnant to nature's laws and ev'ry rule of right. Charlotte. Ah! Freeman, is it so? Then much I fear I've took my leave of joy. Weldon. Oppose not my proposals; trust thy friend, Who will use evr'y honest art to heal Your wounds, and to emerge ye from distress. (Aside to Freeman. I'm going now Upon a work that to the world will shew My sense of honour, justice, and of truth: To-morrow ye shall see me here again, If rightly I presage, a welcome guest. Y. Freeman. I yield to the conditions: only this, After I've visited my unhappy father, Let me watch her slumbers if she sleeps, Or, if her griefs deny her eyelids rest, Let me near her, lest, in the absence of her reason, she may commit some violence on the lovelyest frame that beauty e'er was cast in.—Let me inteat my mother to be mindful of herself, and to extend her care to the dear idol of my eyes and soul, while I am absent here: expect my quick return; which, I hope, will be more joyful than this parting is. Farewel, my love; long may I call thee mine; For I've no life but what is wrap'd in thine. The End of the Fourth ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Freeman's House. Charlotte sleeping, and Young Freeman by her. Y. Freeman. If there are ministers of heav'n to guard The innocent, and virtue is their care, Here let them take their charge: From your cœlestial citadels descend, And from her seat of thought Drive ev'ry image of affliction; there Let no appearances admittance gain But what are fruitful of delight; to her mind's eye Shew the fair prospect of our future loves; And let no traces of her former griefs Be lurking there; but let her wake to joy. She smiles; and on her lips a thousand beautys sit. (He kisses her. Was ever kiss so sweet! Charlotte. My Freeman and my father hand in hand! Then they are friends. Alas! where am I, or where have I been? Y. Freeman. You're with your husband, you're with him to whom You've plighted everlasting truth and love, With him who ne'er can entertain a wish That is repugnant to your own desires. Charlotte. O! what delusive visions round me play'd, Which plac'd before my eyes my loving father! My slumbers flatter'd me with happyness; They clos'd my senses, which were tir'd with sorrow, And plac'd before me images of joy; But, now awak'd from the fallacious dream, I find myself again a fatherless child, Left with my weeping mother, to bemoan A parent murder'd by my husband's sire. Y. Freeman. Soul of my soul, wound not my ears and heart With your reflections on my injur'd father: I have been with him, And have exhausted almost all my tears Over his sufferings: he's innocent, Tho strong the evidence against him; And if he dys, he dys for an offence Which he cou'd ne'er commit: But what his fate is we shall know 'e're-long. Charlotte. If he is innocent, forbid it, heav'n, That he shou'd suffer more: But, innocent or not, so strong I find Is the affection of my heart to Freeman, I wou'd endeavour, if I survive this shock, to admit of joy, That I may be the cause of joy to you. Y. Freeman. Then all the study of my days to come Shall be to grow superior in my love: Yes, I will stretch invention to contrive Variety of pleasures for my bride; For ev'ry day shall, like the bridal day, Witness to my extravagance of fondness. SCENE II. Mrs. Freeman enters. Mrs. Freeman. If I've offended, if my guilt is great, The measure of my suff'rings sure is full. Y. Freeman. Well have I stood the tempest yet; But much I dread the bolt that's coming now. Mrs. Freeman. Hot as it is, you must receive it— Y. Freeman. O! stay; And if my father's dead, or soon to dy, Suspend a while the terrible account, That I may put the choicest armour on That reason can afford; for much I fear, Tho lay'd on Charlotte's breast, and prop'd by love, The words which bring the tydings of his death Will, like the ball from an unerring hand That stops the flying dove, lay me as breathless down. Charlotte. Avert it, heav'n, whate'er it is that may Affect my husband's life, or health; and blast His wife with ruin, so you save but him. Y. Freeman. Thou angel, O! thou goddess of my fate, You've offer'd to lay down too vast a price For such a life as mine. Did ever marry'd state begin like this! Yet, I will live, if I can live, for thee. Mrs. Freeman. My dearest son, Long may you live, and weather thro the storm; And may your joys be many, And lasting all, when I am lay'd in dust: You've bus'ness here with life, but I have none. Y. Freeman. O! Weldon! O! my friend! Where's the assistance that you promis'd me? Mrs. Freeman. The melancholly news which now I bring Relate not to your father. The virtuous matron's dead; the weight of grief Pressing too fast upon her Has stop'd her springs of life; and she's no more. Y. Freeman. Who is no more? Mrs. Freeman. Your Charlotte's mother. (Charlotte faints. Y. Freeman. She sinks, she faints; and if the angel's fled To her original heaven, I've nothing more to manage here on earth. (Turning to Mrs. Freeman. This is a tale you shou'd have told to me, That at a proper season, and with due preparation, it might have reach'd her ear.— O! Charlotte! O! my wife! hear, hear, the voice Of him that calls you back to life, to love.— Her breast is cold, her eyes have loss'd their lustre; But her breath's sweeter than the Syrian rose. O! charm me with the music of thy voice!— She breathes; and on her lips carnations bloom; And her eyes cheer me like the morning sun. Charlotte. Who calls me back to life, to wretchedness? Y. Freeman. To life, my soul, and love. The greatest shock That you cou'd dread is over; And, after such a black and dismal storm, The face of heav'n must soon begin to clear. Charlotte. Mine is no common case, no vulgar misery: A loving father, and the tenderest mother That ever child was bless'd with, gone, and for ever loss'd! Who, not divested of humanity, Can see my woes with an unpitying eye? And what daughter, That has a sense of duty and of love, Can think of joy, Or can, in my condition, think of life? Come death, O! come, thou friendly everlasting sleep, And close my eyes in night that knows no dawn. Y. Freeman. Perish a thousand worlds rather than you Shou'd give Those scarcely-tasted beautys to the grave! 'Tis virtue now to live, To save that life which all depends on thine. You're upon duty now, to which By nature and by providence you're bound; Your duty is to strive to live for me; All the rich treasure of your love is mine: The harder your duty is, The greater is your virtue to obey. Charlotte. If I can live, I need not strive to love.— O! Freeman, take me to your honest heart; And, if I keep the full possession there, Life will be worth my care. Great is the present illness of my mind; And you alone must my physician be: Tho strong the pains which have besieg'd me round, Your love must be the cure of all my woes. Y. Freeman. Come to this breast, Which has no room for any guest but you. Now witness heaven That I've no thoughts of paradise beyond What my dear Charlotte, what my love, can give: I have no wish but what I wish for you: Wish I to live, 'tis that my life may be Employ'd in tender offices to you: Wou'd I behold encrease of flocks and herds, 'Tis that I wou'd encrease my love's fair dow'r: Have I delight to see my garden yield The fairest flow'rs which e'er adorn'd the spring, 'Tis that they may adorn a fairer flow'r: Do I hope To see my fruit-trees bending with their weight, 'Tis that I may prepare a grateful feast, And to the cheerful banquet call my love. Whate'er I wish to have, or wish to be, 'Tis to improve thy bliss, and merit thee. SCENE III. The Scene changes. The Court sitting, the Judge, the Jury, Witnesses, Freeman senr. at the bar, and Weldon foreman of the Jury. Judge. Ye hear the charge against him. Seven witnesses of reputation here Swear that they found him striding o'er the dead, And in his hand a staff, whose bloody point Exactly fill'd the wound, fresh bleeding then: Add to this circumstance, which seems to me No less than demonstration of his guilt, The long dissention which has been betwixt them. From what we've hear'd we must our judgement pass; In mine he's guilty; but the sentence rests In you The arbitrators of his life or death: You, who are foremost of the jury, speak. Weldon. He's innocent. Judge. Is that the voice of all? Weldon. I speak the voice of all. Judge. Now, by the sacred majesty of heav'n, That sees and judges all, the blood of him, Our fellow subject, that was foully murder'd, Crys loud for justice; blood for blood repay: In him the king, his wife, and only child, Have loss'd a subject, husband, and a father: The king, his wife, and child, of you demand That justice shou'd be executed here. Think ye the poor unhappy man that fell, Because he wanted riches, has no friend? Yes, he shall find a friend, as well as he Whose wealth perhaps procur'd him friends in you. Weldon. Hear, me rash judge; nor stigmatise the names Of such as scorn a bribe as much as you. Give me your promise that his life's secure, And I'll produce in court the man that kill'd him; Nor do I ask that promise but on terms Which you may grant with honour. If it appears that he who kill'd him did it Neither in wrath, nor with his will's consent, But in his own defence, your promise stands. Judge. I freely give it; and be heaven's high judge My witness. Weldon. I am the man. Judge. Bold and intrepid!—Quick proceed to ease Th' astonish'd court, that's full of expectation. Weldon. Behold in me The man that kill'd him, but no murderer. Judge. Now to the fact. Weldon. Tho my mind is shock'd At the remembrance of the fatal deed, And gladly wou'd avoid th' unpleasing tale, Yet, in regard to truth and my fair name, I will begin.—Early in the morning, As my custom is, I walk'd o'er Briar's grounds, And met him unexpected in my way: I took occasion then to talk to him Of an account that has been long betwixt us: As our dispute grew high, I thought he us'd A language too ingrateful to the man Who had been a patient creditor so long: Indeed he did provoke me, by his ungentle usage, To treat him with more warmth than ever yet I treated any man, And to reproach him with severity: Th' unhappy man, impatient of rebuke, With all the force of his uplifted arm, Struck on my temples with an oaken staff: With my superior strength the stick I wrested from him, And, smarting with the blow, drove at his side; When suddenly he fell, and with a groan Cry'd, I've deserv'd my death, and spoke no more: Astonish'd at the blood which flow'd from him, I view'd the staff; at the small end of which Was a sharp iron spike, which had before Escap'd my eye. I look'd around; and seeing no one near, I walk'd away, And sighing thought the poor illfated man Had too severely pay'd the debt he ow'd me. My sorrows with my story so encrease, I beg a respite here.—My friend can best Relate what happen'd next, When, walking o'er the field, he found him dead. Judge. Th' almighty judge knows how my soul rejoices At this our clearing of the innocent. Take up the thread of this surprising tale; (To Freeman senr. And baulk not our attention with delay. Freeman senr. Gay and as joyful as the sun I went To ask th' unhappy man, that's dead, to come To my son's wedding feast; but, as I cross'd The field, I saw him lying on the ground: Then down I lay'd my staff to raise him up; But, to my vast surprise, I found him dead: Griev'd and confus'd, scarce knowing what I did, Instead of my own staff, I took up his: These neighbours passing by, and seeing us In this condition, seiz'd me as his murderer: They hurry'd me before a magistrate, And then to jail.—Weldon, my worthy friend, As he best knows What follow'd, he can best pursue the tale. Judge. In conscious virtue bold, as you begun, Conclude, in your own innocence secure. (To Weldon. Weldon. From the first moment that I saw him seiz'd, I was resolv'd to rescue him from death, E'en if I dy'd myself.—The tryal being near, my first endeavours were to be of the jury: how in that office I've discharg'd my trust, ye've seen. Judge. An office that requires the purest mind! They whom their country chuse for such a trust, Upon whose verdict, as on fate, depend Our propertys, our lives, and libertys, Shou'd bring with them An ear that's deaf to the deceiver's voice, A breast untainted, and a hand unstain'd: And he that fills the solemn judgement-seat Shou'd not too rashly pass the dreadful sentence On the accus'd from circumstances only: Better that twenty shou'd escape the laws Than one shou'd suffer in a wrongful cause. The END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE. To mark a GEORGE's reign, this wond'rous age Abounds in schisms both in the church and stage: They who are born to taste with pleasure throng To Shakespear's sense, or Farinello's song: The tasteless vulgar, as experience tells, Warmly espouse their Harlequins and Nells. As great the difference in the church is seen, Where Wesley is, and Whitefield In the reign of king GEORGE the Second these men pretended to a New Birth, and called themselves and their followers Methodists: they were too mean, and ignorant, to be taken notice of but for the concourse of idle low people, whom they drew from their busyness and care of their familys. The consequence of their nonsensical doctrine, if put in practice, would have been a total neglect of trade and commerce, and men must have turned out to graze on the common. The discerning part of mankind were divided in their opinions of there people, whether they were only fools, or fools and knaves; for they raised contributions from their followers for pretended charitys abroad; and odd storys were told of their prevailing on many weak persons, wives and servants, to advance them money for charitable uses, not reguarding how those wives and servants got that money. They were regularly ordained, but were prohibited preaching in the churches; and they afterwards tumultuously assembled in lanes, fields, commons, and the highways. This note is necessary, because it is almost impossible that the names of these men should be known many years hence. Harlequin: For them the shuttle's left by lazy weavers; And butchers drop their marrow-bones and cleavers; And, while the weaver's wife forsakes the loom, Susan leaves half unmop'd the dining-room: These are the dregs, the rubbish, of mankind, Sightless themselves, and guided by the blind, Strangers to virtue, as unknown to schools: As ev'ry like its like, fools cherish fools. While we behold the just and prudent train In the fair temples which the laws ordain, Where Berriman, or Denne, or Terrick, preach What well becomes the good and wise to teach, The rabble herd (to novelty and fear Eternal slaves) to Kennington Whitefield frequently preached on Kennington common. repair: 'Tis there the human hogs on offal feed, And cripples lean upon a broken reed.</field>
