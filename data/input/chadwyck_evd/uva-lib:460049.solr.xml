      <field name="fulltext">THE HAPPY CAPTIVE, AN English OPERA. WITH AN INTERLUDE, In Two Comick SCENES, BETWIXT Signor Capoccio, a Director from the Canary Islands; and Signora Dorinna, a Virtuosa.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable My Lady MONSON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. It may not be amiss to take Notice, that, as the Subject of this Opera is not drawn from real History, so neither is it a new Fiction; but shadow'd out from a Novel in Cervantes's Don Quixote, (Book IV. of the First Part) call'd, The History of the Slave. The Readers will find that I have been obliged to alter some Circumstances in the Novel, in order to adapt them to the Conduct of a Drama. The Interlude, which is added in two Comick Scenes, is entirely new to our Climate: and the Success of it is submitted to Experiment, and the Taste of an Audience.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Carlos, the Captive. Pizarro, his Friend, late a Captive, but ransom'd. Morat, a Moor, design'd to marry Zorayda. Zorayda in Love with Carlos. Selima, courted by Pizarro. Page to Zorayda.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, Algier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTERLUDE. Signor Capocchio, the Director. Signora Dorinna, the Virtuosa. Maid-Servants; Opera-Dressers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE, the Court of a Prison. Enter Carlos, fetter'd; a Letter in his Hand. Carl. O liberty, Thou universal Hope and Joy! Let not thy Gifts my Bliss destroy, Who wish not to be free. Freedom would be my Bane; Bandage, I bless thy Chain: Thy darling Fetters, Love! I wear, And Happiness is only here. O Liberty, &amp;c. And Happiness is only here. What may she be?âan Angel, sure: Her heav'nly Form and Soul Bespeak no less. With what Profusion Of Bounty visits she my captive State! Show'rs down her Gold, as she possess'd The Wealth of Africk's Mines!â She bids me here to cherish Hopes: Says, if I not the Means disdain, I shall be Master of my Fate.â Ingratitude, I know thee not.âMy conscious Heart Beats with a fierce Desire How to repay my wondrous Debt. What sweet Delusions sooth my Breast, And to some fancied Bliss invite! Like one with gawdy Dreams possess'd, I fear to wake, and lose Delight. Pizarro,âOh, my Friend! SCENE II. Carlos and Pizarro. Carl. What Tidings from the golden Shore, The Land of Paradise? Piz. What but encreasing Joys? The fair Zorayda Salutes you with this Gemm, (Delivering him a Jewel. The secret Pledge of constant Faith. Carl. O lovely, gen'rous Maid! Thou Miracle of Bounty! Steal to my Breast, dear secret Pledge; Bright Emblem of Zorayda's Eyes, And Treasure of my Heart! Piz. She sighs to think upon those Bonds: ButâFreedom lives in Hope. Carl. My Chains are Bracelets, whilst I live her Slave. Piz. She was, like you, a Captive once; Like you, Spain claims her Birth. In earliest Infancy She with her Mother (then the Boast Of Saragossa's Plains;) By Corsairs was surpriz'd, and hither brought. The Moor Abdalla, Your rigorous Master now, Redeem'd them from the Pirates' Hands: Beneath his Roof receiv'd his purchas'd Prize, And, vanquish'd by the Mother's Charms, Soften'd their Doom of Bondage; But soon the mourning Matron dy'd.â Carl. Alas! There poor Zorayda's Breast First heav'd with Sorrow's Pangs. Piz. The tender Maid, with thousand soft Attractions Won on her Moorish Master's Heart. Careful, he rear'd her blooming Youth; To Turkish Doctrines sway'd her yielding Mind; And stiles the beauteous Proselyte his Child. Carl. Pernicious Zeal!â Piz. By Custom and Constraint Her Service, not her Heart, consents. Her Mother's Shade, a Call from Heav'n, (For so the pious Virgin deems;) Invite her longing Thoughts To seek her native Clime, and native Faith. But, for the Meansâ Carl. For that alone I would be free! Where learn'd my Friend This Story of her Fortunes? Piz. From Selima; The fair, inchanting Selima: The Partner of her inmost Thoughts. Carl. Thanks to the virtuous Maid! Piz. Forgive a Lover's Fondness: Rapture and Joy are in her Name. Gentle Love, thou Source of Pleasure, Transports yielding without Measure, Only bless'd, when we obtain thee, Only savage Hearts disdain thee: Sweet thy Tumults, soft thy Anguish, Inly soothing past expressing: Comforts blending as we languish, Ev'ry Pang becomes a Blessing. Carl. My sympathizing Heart Bounds with the same Delight. Zorayda sits inthron'd within my Breast, And fills each vital Part with Joy. Piz. Retire, and know what Bliss attends thee.â Soon as Suspicion's Ear is stop'd, And Night and friendly Silence reign, A subterranean Vault, That opens to your Cell, And to the Moor Abdalla's Garden leads, Shall guide you to your lov'd Zorayda's Presence.â She trusts you far: Let safe Discretion Set Limit to your Transports.â I must return: Close to your Cell, And wait th'expected Hour. Carl. Now, Blessings on thy Soul! (Embracing, and exit Pizarro. SCENE III. Carlos alone. Carl. Am I on Earth? Or, like to raptur'd Bards, Mount I the Heav'ns, and tread on Stars? Come, sable Night; thou blissful Time, Which Lovers never think too long, Wrap me in thy inchanting Shades: I sicken at the Sun.â Exit Carlos. SCENE IV. A Garden. Zorayda and Selima come forward, as from an Arbour. Zor. My Breast is like a troubled Sea, Toss'd by unruly Winds. FearsâWishesâDoubtsâand flatt'ring Hopes, With momentary, varying Rage, Like Wave on Wave, succeed by Turns, And dash each other out. Sel. Your wonted Constancy resume. Oft the conflicting Soul, Flutter'd with wild Suspense, (Like tender Bird in Air too rude;) Forms to itself imaginary Tumults. Zoray. O Selima! Indulgent Maid! Reason, and conscious Honour Tell me, I've been too rash. How may the censuring World impeach my Name, And envious Obloquy Stain and misconstrue what I've done! Ev'n Carlos too, perhaps, Shall with ungen'rous Thought arraign The Fondness of my Heart; Wounding my Love with sland'rous Imputation. Like to the tender, fragrant Flow'r, Subject to ev'ry blasting Pow'r, Virgins by Trust are oft undone. Virtue, that Rose, which, void of Dread, Securely rears its gawdy Head, Feels the chill Wind, or scorching Sun. Like to the tender, &amp;c. But see, Pizarro comes: The ebbing Blood forsakes my Cheek, To tell my Heart, he comes.â SCENE V. Zorayda, Selima, Pizarro. Piz. Hail, virtuous Maids! How well your Beauties Supply the waining Day? The busie Heav'n Is lighting up its choicest Lamps To guide the happy Carlos to his Bliss. Zoray. Does he with willing Soul embrace my Summons? Piz. Not with more Pride the lawrell'd Chief Mounts his triumphal Carr: Not with more Ecstacy of Love Greet I my darling Selima. Zoray. How like a wanton Prodigal I've set my Fortunes all at Stake! Should he prove falseâ Piz. Distrust not so your Charms: Those beauteous Eyes must bind his Soul In adamantine Chains. Sel. Ha! my deluded Heart! Softness and Passion Steal thro' his Looks, and tremble on his Tongue. Enter Page. Page. Madam, my Lord Abdalla With most impatient Haste Demands your Presence. Zoray. Say, I attend his Will. Exit Page. My Bosom's full of many Cares. Let me, before you seek Repose, Partake your friendly Counsels. (To Selima. Pizarro, My Fate depends upon your Faith. Exit Zorayda. SCENE VI. Pizarro, Selima. Piz. My Selima! Sel. Her Fate depends upon your Faith.â Piz. What means my Fair? Sel. Distrust not so your Charms: Those beauteous Eyes must bind his Soul In adamantine Chains.â Perfidious Wretch! Piz. From what a Spirit comes This? Sel. Take back your fickle Vows, Breath'd to the list'ning Heav'ns in vain; I scorn to share in a divided Heart. Your Sex is all Delusion.â Cheated by flatt'ring Words and Sighs, Professions, Oaths, and streaming Eyes, We fall your easy Prey. Ruin and Death are in your Smile, And, like the treach'rous Crocodile, You weep but to betray. Piz. Ah, cruel and injurious Maid! With your keen Ponyard pierce my Breast; But do not wound my Faith. Sel. Your Faith is tainted by Zorayda's Eyes. Piz. Harbour not such a Thought. If I am false, the vengeful Pow'rs, That witness to a Lover's Truth, Strike me with Misery! Swift Lightnings blast me! Or, what I most should dread, let Death Come wing'd from Selima's resenting Frown! Sel. Enough; I'm satisfied:â What most we value, most we fear to lose. Piz. O Sounds to chear a lovesick Heart! Sweet as the Musick of the Spheres Sung to by Angels Notes! The Transports of my Joy O'erpow'r all Sense.âMy kindest Fair, O let me lead thee to that blissful Bow'r Where first I breath'd my Love; There I'll recount a thousand Vows Of firmest Constancy: Whilst Zephyrs with officious Zeal Waft 'em, like Incense, to the purple Heavens. Sel. Too frail are Women's Hearts. Take heed, how with a Syren's Song You cheat my credulous Soul. Exeunt. SCENE VII. Changes to Carlos's Cell. Carlos alone. Carl. How am I tortur'd on the Rack Of fierce Impatience!âMortal Joys Are ever dash'd with these Abatements, To teach us what we are.â My Eyes are Traytors, or a Gleam of Light Breaks on my gloomy Cell; Fair as the Beam that dawn'd on Chaos first, And gladden'd springing Nature's Face; Sweet as the Bliss-inviting Taper, That flam'd from Hero's Wave-beat Tow'r, To guide Leander to the Virgin's Arms. Auspicious Love, Befriend thy faithful Votary! Enters the Vault. SCENE VIII. Prospect of a Grotto in Abdalla's Garden. Enter Zorayda, veil'd. Zoray. He cannot miss the Way. Thro' the long Vault a Train of Lamps Shoot their directing Fires.â A Lover's secret Steps should be Fleet as the Air, and softer than the Down Of Cytherea's Doves.âHe comes; Be still, my lab'ring Heart! SCENE IX. Carlos from the Grotto, and Zorayda. Carl. Cynthia, who deign'd on Latmos' Brow To greet Endymion, lowly Swain, Came not in Cloud: But, liberal, to the happy Boy Display'd the Treasure of her Charms. Zoray. I would have skreen'd the mantling Blood, That flushes to my Cheek:â But, see, you are obey'd. [Unveiling. Carl. O Beauties, orient as the Morn, When with her earliest rosy Beams She paints the crimson Skyes! Zoray. Stranger, our Conf'rence must be short. What wou'd I say?âIf that your Eye Be not inthrall'd, and your ty'd Heart Owns not some happier Virgin's Sway, The rest let Blushes speak. Carl. Witness ye Heav'ns, and kindly Stars, That govern human Fates, Whilst, with transported Tongue, I vow This Heart was free as Air, Till fetter'd by those Eyes. Zoray. Echo, that tuneful Strain prolong, 'Tis Musick fit to swell thy Song: Teach ev'ry vocal Vale and Grove To catch, and spread, the Voice of Love. My Soul with Bliss so full is crown'd, Death only now my Peace can wound. Echo, that tuneful, &amp;c. Carl. What have the mystick Fates in Store, To make me yet more bless'd? Zoray. Leave that to Time. Approve your Faith and constant Heart, Ourselves will guide our Fates. Take this, and with a serious Soul Weigh its Contents. (Giving him a Paper. Carl. Oh, let me on my Knees receive The Harbinger of Joy: And on that snowy Hand impress My Vows of purest Faith. Zoray. I grow too lavish of my Fame, And play with Danger.â If I appear not cheap in your Esteem, Faithful Pizarro will assist To lead us thro' the Maze of winding Fortune. I stay too long. DUETTO. Carl. 'Tis Night indeed now you depart, [Carl.], Zoray. I feel the/Let not a/ Gloom o'erspread my/your Heart. Carl. Zoray. When/Soon/ shall gay Comfort ease/my/your Heart. Both. And Hours of Bliss return again. 'Tis Night, &amp;c. They go out separately: Carlos to the Grotto; and Zorayda as to Abdalla's House. End of the First ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AN INTERLUDE, In Two Comick SCENES, BETWIXT Signor Capoccio, a Director from the Canary Islands; and Signora Dorinna, a Virtuosa. SCENE I. A Chamber. Dorinna; and two Chambermaids setting the Room in order. Dorin. Quick, quick, dispatch, and mind Affairs, Bring the Spinett, and set the Chairs. (Oh! how much Patience had One need With this perverse, vexatious Breed!) They know, this Instant I expect here A Foreigner, et un Directeur; Yet, what a Litter all about? Fly, fly, begone, and wait without: And there attend my Ambasciata's.â [Exeunt Chambermaids. Now, let me run o'er these Cantata's. This is too difficult;âThis, out of Fashion; Void of all modern Grace and Passion.â What Transports can that Musick make, That wants the Semi-demi Quavers and the Shake? O, This will do:âBut, hark! 'Tis He: Escourt Him up immediately. Signor Capoccio introduc'd. Capoc. Madam,â Dorin. Signor Capocchio,â I am profoundly yours. Your Chair, I pray.â Capoc. Signora Dorinna,â To stand a Summer's Day, Ev'n tho' the Dogstar were at height, On your Commands would be Delight. Dorin. (A Compliment extravagant!) Signor,â Capoc. Madam, son vostro Servitor. Madam, in our Canary Isles, (Where Nature so on Musick smiles, The very Birds express such Notes, As Orpheus' Soul inform'd their Throats:) A pompous Theatre we boast, (Supported at the publick Cost,) For Which your humble Slave comes hither To get a Company together: Your self the Chief of our Ambition; No Voice with Your's in Competition. Dorin. I've four or five Sollicitations Press'd on me strong from diff'rent Nations, Must therefore think t'engage me, where Terms are most promising and fair. Capoc. Madam, Directors in Canary From Those of other Nations vary; We pour our Gold by Bags-full down; Agree, and make the Terms your own. Dorin. That Article, indeed, has Weight; Tho' there is one Objection yet,â Capoc. Pray, what? Dorin. Our Language would be new, Quite foreign, and unknown to You. Capoc. Eh! make no Strain of that Affair; We give a Book to the Parterre; And so the Singing be but good, No Reason, Words be understood. Dorin. In Airs, perhaps, you may dispense With a convenient Want of Sense; But where the Business is on Foot, Some Sense is necessary to't. Capoc. There You mistake Us: In our Nation, At such Time 'tis the reigning Fashion For Pit and Boxes, tÃªte Ã  tÃªte, To laugh aloud, and joke, and prate. Dorin. If it be so indeed, 'tis well. Capoc. Now freely your Pretensions tell. Dorin. I must in Mind th'Affair revolve, Before I can at once resolve. Capoc. Resolve, and to your sweet Controul I make the Tender of my Soul. Those brilliant Eyes, like Lamps, inspire My glowing Breast with fierce Desire, I sigh;âbut ev'ry Sigh is Fire. Dorin. You are so courteous,â Capoc. âO my Heart! One Air, I hope, e'er I depart. Dorin. How strange his Figure and his Fashion! Capoc. You willâ(she's full of Affectation.) Dorin. Excuse me, I'm so very hoarse. Capoc. One Song requires not so great Force. Dorin. Nor is the Instrument in Tune. Capoc. I shall quite lose all Temper soon. Dorin. Nor I myself in Exercise.â Capoc. No matter; you are over-nice. Keep me no longer in Suspense. I'm sick of her Impertinence.â Dorin. If I comply, 'tis great Assurance. Capoc. Oh, doubt not: This is past Indurance. [She sits down to the Spinett. Dorin. Stern God of Love, be not so spightful, Capoc. (Oh, delightful!) Dorin. But deign in Pity to relieve A Capoc. (Che viva!) Dorin. A Heart, that swells and bursts with Pain. Capoc. (That again: O Brava!) Dorin. Too, too tyrannick is thy Law, Capoc. (Bell trillo in VeritÃ .) Dorin. Break not, but sooth me to thy Awe. Capoc. (O Cara!) Dorin. Cruelty never Capoc. (Encor for ever!) Dorin. A Convert did gain. Capoc. You so excel, Your Voice is clear as any Bell: And then so voluble your Throat, That you devour Note after Note. Dorin. O Sir,âBut by your Words, I'm sure, You are a perfect Connoisseur. Capoc. I know as much as Gentlemen should know. Dorin. You must perform to Admiration, That speak in such a feeling Fashion. Capoc. Nay, you shall hear: I'm not precise; Nor stay to be entreated twice. [Draws a Cantata out of his Pocket. Dorin. Some Piece, no doubt, of choice Repute. Capoc. Madam, whene'er I sing, 'tis known, The Words and Musick are my own. Dorin. A Poet too? Capoc. There lies my Strength and Excellence, I've such a Vein and Flow of Sense, That, e'er a Month, I'll finish clean Fifteen Productions for the Scene. Dorin. Prodigious! [Capoccio sits down to the Spinett. Capoc. Thy sweetest Beams of Love impart, Bright Salamander of my Heart! My tortur'd Heart, that burns, and fryes, Beneath the Ãtna of thy Eyes. All This to You alone is meant. Dorin. I thank You for the Compliment. Capoc. Soften the Rigours of thy Brow, On whose broad Arches, all a-row, Young Cupids ride, and frisk, and play; And keep eternal Holyday. What say You to't? Dorin. I can't but wonder at so rare a Muse. Capoc. Oh,âYou shall hear this other Air. Dorin. Let me not trespass, Sir, too far. Capoc. Madam, I would not spare one Note, Tho' I were sure to split my Throat. Dorin. The tedious Fool! [Capocchio beginning to sing. Capoc. Wherefore, Phillis, will you be Cruel, and unkind, to Me? [Dorinna beckons to her Maid, who comes to her. Dorin. What is't you'd have?âSignor, my Maidâ Capoc. Curse on the damn'd intruding Jade! Dorin. Signor, a Set of Company Are met, and only wait for Me. Pardon,âI must be gone at once. Capoc. Hear but this Chain of Semitones. 'Tis short.â Dorin. You must excuse me now. Capoc. With what Impatience shall I burn To hasten my desir'd Return! DUETTO. Capoc. I must obey my Fate unkind; But, think, I leave my Soul behind. Dorin. Permit me wait You to your Chair; Capoc. No, I declare. Dorin. I mustâ Capoc. You must not:âPray, forbear. [She still offering to follow him. Capoc. Nay, if you stir, I ne'er can go. Dorin. Oh, sÃ¬, sÃ¬, sÃ¬. Capoc. NÃ², nÃ², nÃ², nÃ². [They go off different Ways with great Ceremony. End of the First SCENE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE, An Apartment in Abdalla's House. Enter Pizarro and Selima. Piz. That tender Love, and soft Desires, Fierce Jealousy, ungentle Scorn, (Discordant Twins) should be the Guests Of one fair Bosom!â Never such Tumult shake again The Region of thy Breast! Sel. You may forgive that Tempest, Which rises from the Coast of Love.â How fares it with your Friend? Piz. As with a Man, whom Fortune courts With all her gayest Smiles.â His Ransom paid, by Spanish Friends, For so Abdalla deemsâGen'rous Zorayda! He waits but my Approach To lead him forth to Liberty and Love. Sel. Fly with the Wings of swiftest Friendship To execute that pleasing Task. I should accuse my savage Heart Of stern Injustice, should he languish, Thro' me, one Moment in his Bonds. Piz. Are all your ruffled Thoughts at Peace? Sel. They areâthey areâOh, stay not to reply. Hastening him out, exit Pizarro. SCENE II. Selima alone. Sel. The Fates are busy in our Aid; Heav'ns prosper the Event!â Hope lifts me up above myself: And, to distrust, were Cowardice of Mind, That merits not Success. Like Diamonds, bright Thro' darkest Night, The Brave their Souls display. Conquest pursues, And Fortune wooes, Where Courage leads the Way. SCENE III. Selima, and Zorayda, to her, weeping. Sel. Ha! whence these Tears? Zoray. Oh, pity my lost State. Sel. What unforeseen Event? Zoray. MoratâMoratâDetested Moor! Demands me for his WifeâAbdalla, Mov'd by his Wealth, his Rank, his Pow'r, Consents, enjoins that instant I obey. Sel. What do you then determine? Zoray. Never to yield to that Embrace. Sel. Carlos no longer's now a Slave. Zoray. There Comfort dawns upon my Soul; And combats with my Fears. Great God of Love, Thy Pow'r approve; To thy protecting Throne I fly. Within my Breast Thou reign'st confess'd; I can be constant, or can die, Great God of Love, &amp;c. Sel. Dry up your Tears; Art must repel This sudden Stroke of wayward Fate. Seem to accept the Match propos'dâ Zoray. How shall I teach my Heart that Baseness! Sel. In Love, Deceit's a venial Crime: Force justifies defensive Wiles.â Abdalla this Way bends his Steps; Leave me to sooth his credulous Ear With a delusive Tale, How you, in secret Transport, prize Th'intended Honour of Morat's Embrace. Zoray. How will That aid? Sel. Anon, when, high in Mirth and Wine, His solemn Festival he celebrates, Occasion shall befriend our Counsels, To form some Scheme of safe Redress. Retire at once:â I would not have the subtle Moor See us togetherâCherish Hope; We'll teach our Fates to smile. Exeunt separately. SCENE IV. Changes to Carlos's Cell. Carlos alone. Carl. The Halcyon, sure, has built her Nest Within my peaceful Bosom: Noâ'tis Zorayda, (charming Maid!) Has fix'd her chosen Mansion here: And, where she dwells, It must be calm, and Sunshine, all around. Th'indulgent Gods, when they design'd Their choicest Blessing to Mankind, Breath'd Love into his raptur'd Soul. Beauty, celestial Gift, was sent To soften Care, inspire Content, And ev'ry Woe of Life controul. Enter a Mute, who takes off Carlos's Fetters. Carl. Ha! Say, what means this dreaded Courtesy?â But thou art mute, and ha'st no Tongue T'expound, or answer to my Fears. Exit Mute. Serenity, thou short-liv'd Guest, Where art thou fled? Now, in thy room, Croud in a thousand boist'rous Cares, Heart-sick Distrust, and agonizing Pains.â What have I done, so soon to forfeit My Paradise of Bliss! SCENE V. Carlos, Pizarro to him, who runs and embraces him. Piz. Welcome to Liberty, my Friend! Carl. Alas! How can that State be welcome, Which may for ever shut me out From dear Zorayda's Sight? Piz. Not so the tender Virgin hop'd, When she contriv'd for your Release. O Golden Ransom ill-employ'd, Were that to be th'Event! Carl. Do I then to the Charmer's Goodness Owe my Enfranchisement? Piz. To her aloneâYou now exchange The servile Fetters of Constraint For her soft, pleasureable, Chains; Link'd in the Arms of Love. Carl. This swift Vicissitude of Fate Chides my desponding Soul; and tells me, Man ought not to despair. Piz. The Heav'ns are watchful for our Good, When least they promise Aid; Shifting th'uncertain Scene. As balmy Spring, and Summer gay, Succeed, and drive out Winter's Day, So Grief and Pleasure keep their Round: Now depressing, Now caressing, Fortune varies still her Ground. Pleasures bloom as Griefs decay, Nature's never at a Stay. As balmy Spring, &amp;c. Carl. Comfort, how sweet from Friendship's Tongue! What now remains my Bliss to crown? Piz. My Roof for your Reception waits. There, Change of Habit is assign'd, Suiting your Change of State. You must the Moorish Garb assume, So shall you pass Abdalla's Slaves Unquestion'd, unsuspected; And, in your lov'd Zorayda's Eyes, Pour forth in Thanks your grateful Soul. Carl. My best Deliv'rer!âTime, I trust, Shall aid me to requite your Love. Like guiding Hermes, lead me strait To second Life.âMy bounding Heart Beats with unwonted Joy. Exeunt. SCENE VI. SCENE, Abdalla's Garden. (Musick with Trumpets and Tambours heard within.) Zorayda, Selima. Sel. These sprightly Sounds proclaim Their Revels at the Height. The licens'd Bowl, At this their solemn Festival, Goes round, ev'n till the crimson Juice Glows thro' their swarthy Cheeks.â Wherefore so pensive? Greet not your Fortunes with a Brow of Care. Zoray. Have I not Cause with inward Thought To ruminate th'approaching Change? I dread th'Event, which most I seek.â How will Abdalla, In bitt'rest Agonies of Soul, With Imprecations load my Name! Call me a base, perfidious Robber! And wooe th'avenging Pow'rs with Pray'r To dart Revenge on my devoted Head! Sel. Tear not your Breast with fruitless Fears, You but resume your own. Did he not with rapacious Hands Seize on your Mother's Wealth, and yours? Did he not once with brutal Force Attempt,âBut the protecting Heav'ns Rescued you from that Shame. Zoray. Yet has he since with tend'rest Love Cherish'd my Youth. Sel. Yet would he now, with all that Love, Commit a Force upon your Heart.â Flight is the only Safety left: Unless you've taught your abject Soul To stoop to curst Morat's Embrace. Zoray. There you awake A sleeping Terror in my Breast: Come, Carlos, come with Arms of Love; And snatch me from that dreaded Danger. Like a frail Bark, too weak to brave The driving Wind, and surging Wave, I float in dread Suspence. Fearing at ev'ry Blast to run Against those Rocks I cannot shun, And hopeless of Defence. Like a frail Bark, &amp;c. Sel. See, with important Haste, and chearful Air, Your Page advances tow'rds us. SCENE VII. Enter Page. Page. Pizarro makes Approach; With him a comely Stranger Youth, In Garb a seeming Moor, But of Complexion fair. Zoray. 'Tis well; their Coming is expected.â Can'st thou be faithful, Boy? And could'st thou be content, should Fate Invite thy Mistress to some distant Shore, Her wand'ring Steps t'attend? Page. With Marks of such indulgent Favour You've still o'erpaid my worthless Duty, Tho' Danger frown'd in rudest Shape, I, to the utmost Bounds of Earth and Sea, Would sue to be your Slave. True as the Flow'r, that to the Sun In Pride erects its gaudy Bloom, I'll watch the Sunshine of your Eye. Prepar'd at ev'ry Glance to run, And execute whate'er you doom, Tho' Death should in the Service lie. Zoray. O Virtue far above thy Years! I'll study well to prize thy Worth. They comeâRetire: Occasion soon Shall put to Proof thy valued Trust. Exit Page. SCENE VIII. Carlos, Pizarro, Zorayda, and Selima. Carl. Joy of my Eyes, and Transport of my Soul! 'Tis not in Words, tho' sweetest Eloquence Flow'd from my Tongue, to breath those Thanks, Which are too big for Thought. My Length of Days to come shall be In pleasing Recompence employ'd. Zoray. Enough; enough: Think, I have play'd the Miser's Part; Who, seeing a Mansion please his Eye, Buyes it for his Delight. Piz. We will with distant Watchfulness provide, Lest any sudden, rude, Surprize Break on your springing Loves. Exit Pizarro, leading Selima. SCENE IX. Carlos, Zorayda. Carl. May I on this fair Field of Snow, Soft as the Cignet's Down, And balmy as th'Arabian Breeze, Repeat my Vows of lasting Faith, And call the dear-lov'd Treasure mine? Zoray. Are you content to make it so? And, at the Shrine, with solemn Rites, Such as your Country's Laws prescribe, To plight your constant Faith? Carl. Not Sickness wishes more for Health, Thirst for the cooling Stream, Than I for that transporting Hour. Zoray. Then, I am yours.â Carl. All is Elysium round me; The Lover's Wish, and Poet's Dream; Rich golden Bow'rs, and Beds of Roses, Sabean Groves, and ev'ry Sweet Fond Nature pours to charm the Sense. Whilst thus I gaze On Beauty's Rays, With sweet Surprize My ravish'd Soul steals thro' my Eyes, In killing Ecstasy. So the Lightning's subtle Dart Instant pierces to the Heart, And, e're we feel our Wound, we dye. Whilst thus I gaze, &amp;c. SCENE X. Pizarro, with Selima, hastily; Carlos, Zorayda. Piz. Their Feast is o'er. Sel. The Train disperse. Zoray. Then must we part. Carl. O killing Grief! Sel. Morat has sought you. (To Zorayda. Carl. Curse on that Name! Zoray. Harbour no Fearsâ Piz. You must give o'er. Zoray. We soon shall meetâ Carl. To part no more. Omnes. We soon shall meet to part no more. Carlos and Bizarro go off one Way; Zorayda and Selima, as to the House. End of the Second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTERLUDE. SCENE II. Signora Dorinna, surrounded with Taylors, Dresses, &amp;c. Dorin. 'Tis a most hideous Dress, I swear; Where is the Majesty, and Air? The Train of an Imperial Vest Should sweep full three Yards long at least. Enter Signor Capoccio. Capoc. See, I'm return'd upon the Wing; And with Me my Cantata bring. Dorin. How am I ev'ry Way besieg'd, With Plague on Plague!âSir, your oblig'd. You'll take This shorter up, I hope: Do but observe the odious Slope.â Capoc. You do perform to Night, I guess? Dorin. O Sir, yes.â Come, come, dispatch, without this Pother; Stick here a Pin, and there another. Capoc. You act the Heroine of the Piece? Dorin. O Sir, yes.â How aukwardly this Sleeve's confin'd! 'Tis pinching Work in ev'ry kind. Capoc. What Time will the Performance take? Dorin. O Sir, yes.â Capoc. What an absurd Reply is this! Dorin. No more of your Fatigue: away: I'll wear it, as it is, to-day. Capoc. Wretches, begone. [The Taylors, Dressers, &amp;c. go off. That Fiddle-faddle's done at last.â [Aside. Dorin. These Plagues are scarce to be surpass'd. Capoc. When You a loud Applause shall hear From ev'ry Part o'th'Theatre, These slight Fatigues will cease of course. Dorin. I from an Audience fear still worse. Humours various as their Faces, Ever busy, shifting Places, Serious Statesmen loud debating, Flutt'ring Fops as idly prating, Bowing, sneezing, ogling, gazing, Wrongly raptur'd, or dispraising, All themselves in kind display. One your Voice, or Gown, displeases; One a Fit of Coughing seizes; Here an inattentive Lover Wishes the dull Stuff were over: Self-admiring, with Grimaces, There One trills out mimick Graces; Boist'rous All,âbecause They pay. Capoc. Such is your Pow'r and Excellence, They'll baffle all design'd Offence. Dorin. Then what still gives me fresh Vexation, I've such a Scene of Agitation, Where Cleopatra comes in Chains, And mourns her Fate and inward Pains. I dread the Force of Passion, which May strain my Voice above its Pitch. Capoc. And 'tis my Grief, I can't be there To see the Joy when you appear. Dorin. That gives me great Concern; because I much rely'd on your Applause. Capoc. May I enjoy a little Touch Of One short Scene? Dorin. 'Twou'd please me much; But without Lights, and Pomp of Scenes, A Stage, and Croud of Violins, Action its Dignity must lose. Capoc. All These we can with Ease suppose. Be You but Cleopatra, here Are Lights and Scenes; and Musick, there: Come with your orient Pearl and Cup, Make me your Antony,âI'll drink it up. Dorin. That's not our Story: Story; 'tis another; A Contest with the Prince, her Brother. Capoc. I'm then your Audience:âYou appear, I'll humbly be content to hear: My Taper, this:âThis, my Libretto:â And now I'm fix'd in my Palchetto. Dorinna , as Cleopatra. O Walls, and Glooms, and barb'rous Stones! Dungeons, unconscious of my Moans! Will you not melt to set me free, Whilst from these Eyes I shed a Sea? Capoc. Alas, poor Girl! Dorin. Th'Usurper, that usurps my Throne, (Can Brothers bear such Hearts of Stone?) Is Ptolomy; 'Tis He; 'tis He! Capoc. O barb'rous Deed! Dorin. Beneath the Load of Chains, and Anguish, I feel my Limbs and Spirits languish. Tyrannick Tyrant Ptolomy! Enjoy my Woes and Misery; I feel, I faint;âI feel, I die. Capoc. Water, Water;âQuick, some Water. Dorin. What's the Matter? Capoc. So to the Life your Part you hit, I swear, I thought you in a Fit. But, come; now let me have the Air. Dorin. What Air? The Scene is finish'd there. Capoc. Finish'd! The Poet pardon me, What! end without a Similie! I, in an Opera of mine, Did in One Air two Similies joyn: An Art, so quite unknown before, That the whole House cry'd out, Encor! Dorin. May I not hear it? Capoc. Surely, yes. I know, 'twill please her to Excess.â [Aside. Suppose a Lover in Distress. So the poor Butterfly by Night, Awak'd by Chance, in Dread Affright, Lost in its gloomy Flight, Flutt'ring, flutt'ring, Inly mutt'ring, Seems to ask the Aid of Light. Or so some Vessel on the Seas, Tost by the North and Southern Breeze, Knowing the Wreck that must ensue, For swift Redress, Fires off her Cannons of Distress; Bum! Bum! Bu! Bu! Dorin. What Poesie! You are In ev'ry Point most singular. Capocc. So I've been told a thousand Times. I'm never at a Loss for Rhymes. Dorinn. Now to our Contractâ Capocc. Oh, that's done. Dorinn. How! My Pretensions are not known. Capocc. I'll sign a Blank; your own Terms make; Only your Slave amongst 'em take. Dorin. This I insist, never t'appear But in the upper Character: And that my Part be never short. Capoc. These are but trifling Things; n'importe. Dorin. Then I must have, the best in kind, Beyond my Salary assign'd, Choc'late, and Coffee, Sweetmeats, Tea, Snuffs of all Sort, and Ratifia, A Table spread with no mean Fare, A handsome Equipage and Chair. Capoc. All those are Bagatelles, so you But to your Slave some Favour shew: A Flame so fierce I can't endure. (A Bell rings. Dorin. Hark! This is for the Overture. Capoc. Plague o'their Haste, so to disjoint My Hopes, just coming to the Point! DUETTO. [Capoc.] May I have leave to court and coo? Dorin. 'Tis of the earliest yet to wooe. I must be gone. Capoc. âFaith, so must I: You do not bid me go and dye? Dorin. No, no, I do not bid You dye. Exeunt separately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE, a Part of Abdalla's Garden. Carlos, alone. Carl. Thus the poor Turtle, all forlorn, Droops for his darling Mate's Return. Ling'ring PhÅbus, faster move; Absence is like Death, in Love. Each long Moment seems a Day, Time stands still, when she's away. Thus the poor Turtle, &amp;c. SCENE II. Pizarro to him, Carlos. Carl. What Tidings bears my Friend? Piz. Most opportune, our Bark is hir'd; A trading Vessel, quick of Sail, That, 'twixt Oran, and our Algiers, Alternate shapes her Course: And still, at her Return, Moors in yon Creek that bounds Abdalla's Garden. This happy Accident Blunts all Suspicion, and befriends Our secret, safe, Departure. Carl. 'Would, that auspicious Hour were come! Oh, that we now, Rich in the Treasure of our Loves, Were bounding o'er the briny Wave! I, bless'd in my Zorayda;â Piz. I, in my Selima. The Hour will come. Anxious were th'expected Blessing, Did not Hope of soon Possessing Make Amends for Fate's Delay. Hope insures the promis'd Treasure, Hope, refining ev'ry Pleasure, Paints the distant Prospect gay. SCENE II. Carlos, Pizarro, Selima. Sel. Carlos, hate not th'unwilling Tongue That bears unwelcome News. Carl. What do your Words portend? Sel. To-morrow's Dawn must to Morat, Such is Abdalla's strict Command, Yield up Zorayda's Hand. Carl. O dreadful Turn of flatt'ring Fate! Is Happiness at best an empty Dream To cheat the credulous Sense, And, when the short Deceit is o'er, Sink us in real Woe? I cannot live, Zorayda lost.â Piz. Prevention yet is ours. We must precipitate our Flight; And, soon as Night with sable Cloud Invests the silent Sky, Hoist Sail, and disappoint the Threats of Fate. Carl. My Soul's oppress'd. O lov'd Pizarro, Exert thy friendly Aid: Summon each Thought, each saving Counsel, To work our Rescue in this common Danger! Sel. All is prepar'd. Piz. Our Bark is ready. Our Friends, th'Assistants of our Flight, Collected, and but wait Command. Sel. Th'affrighted Maid, Waits in the lonely Grotto's Shade To sigh her last Farewell: Then die, t'approve her Faith. Carl. Just Heav'ns defend! Oh, let me fly, Swift as the Wings of Love can bear me, To raise the fainting Charmer up: We shall expect you there.â Exit Carlos. SCENE IV. Pizarro, Selima. Piz. The Time grows busy, and invites Our best DispatchâIs all prepar'd? Sel. Our Caskets and Attire, Safely bestow'd, wait but th'Approach of Gloom For safe ConveyanceâWe shall not come Two empty Beggars to your Arms. Piz. O Selima! I have a Soul, that can contemn External Wealth compar'd with thee. To fold you thus, is to be rich As wide Morocco's Kings. Sel. Such ever is the Wooer's Strain; Soothing us with obsequious Fondness: But when the Gordian Knot is ty'd, You then assume tyrannick Sway, And we're domestick Slaves. Piz. Fear not that Change: You shall to Death Command my fervent Heart. Sel. With equal Arts could Virgins meet You Men's Deceit, You then would fear to change. But fondly still your Vows believing, Ourselves deceiving, We teach you how to range. Instant, let's join our Friends. Exeunt. SCENE V. SCENE, another Part of Abdalla's Garden. Enter Morat. Morat. This stubborn Maid meets not my Flame With suiting Fervour. Scorn and Coldness Sit on her sullen Brow, And speak a Heart estrang'd. Shall I then link me to Disdain? A gen'rous Pride forbids that Shame. I'll seek her out, and sound her inmost Thoughts. Here, in her private Haunts, 'tis said, A seeming Turk, a comely White, Holds her in secret Converse. That wakes Surmise; and just Suspicions Shall spur me to Revenge. The puny God of Love, who binds In silken Fetters feeble Minds, No Tyrant o'er this Heart shall reign. With Rage I'll scare the idle Boy, Break all his Darts, his Wiles destroy, And, like the Lion, shake my Chain. Exit Morat. SCENE VI. SCENE, Prospect of the Grotto. Carlos; Zorayda, weeping. Carl. Oh, spare that precious, pearly Dew, Misfortune is too richly graced With such a Pomp of Sorrow.â My Heart weeps Blood for ev'ry falling Tear. Teach not disastrous Fate To grow in Love with Beauty in Distress. Zoray. I stand as on a Rock: The foaming Waves, with emulous Strife, Mount up on ev'ry Side To sink me in the horrid Deep. Carl. Fright not thy tender Soul. These Arms of Love, Strong in thy Aid, shall snatch thee thence, And bear thee o'er th'imagin'd Flood. Zoray. Alas! To-morrowâ MoratâI dye beneath that Thought. Carl. This Night is ours: We'll seize the Time, And be before-hand with the Fates. A Band of chosen Friends are ready By Force to bear thee off secure, Should Opposition cross our purpos'd Flight. Zoray. Tax not my Fondness, if I seek Protection in thy Arms: Here all my Cares are lull'd to Peace. With what sweet Charm Can Love disarm, Each raging Tumult of the Breast! SCENE VII. Morat, behind; Carlos, Zorayda. Mor. 'Tis, as I thought: She's lock'd in his Embrace. Zoray. We are surpriz'd.â Mor. Perfidious Maid! And is it thus, your treach'rous Heart Betrays Abdalla's tender Care. Ha! wondrous Humbleness of Soul! What, joining with a grov'ling Slave, New ransom'd from the Chain? Insolent, base, Intruder! Carl. Uncivil, base, Barbarian! Mor. That Garb assum'd, dishonestly prophan'd, To cloak thy guilty, treach'rous Purpose, Demands due Chastisement. Carl. Hold off; or fear to wake a Rage Which may be fatal to Thee. Mor. Are you so bold? [Drawing his Scimitar. Zoray. Protect him Heav'ns! SCENE VIII. As Morat is going to attack Carlos, enter Pizarro with Sailors. Pizar. Seize on the boist'rous Moor; Disarm his dang'rous Hand. Mor. Villainous Traytors! Pizar. Go, bind him to some distant Tree; If he resists, or with a clam'rous Tongue Presumes t'impede our Safety, That Scimitar instructs you what to do. Mor. Curse on my adverse Stars! [Morat dragg'd off. Carl. Still my Preserver! Oh, what Thanks! Zorayda,âthy poor flutt'ring Heart Pants like the captiv'd Dove with Fear. All's well, my Love. How returning Beauties break, Like radiant Morn, All proud t'adorn, And with new Crimson paint thy Cheek! Such Lustre young Aurora pours, And wakes to Life the springing Flow'rs. Pizar. The Ev'ning's Gloom descends apace; And from the Shore a fav'ring Breeze Plays in the rustling Shrouds, Inviting our Escape. SCENE IX. Selima, Carlos, Zorayda, Pizarro. Sel. In the dark Grove, that fronts the Shore, Your trusty Page, in secret Watch, Broods o'er our Caskers safely stow'd, And waits impatient of Command. Carl. Time and our Safety urge the instant Hour, And chide Delay.âSmile, my Zorayda, And charm the Heav'ns to bless our Flight! CHORUS. The fav'ring Gales Swell out our Sails, And to the Main invite: Venus, asswage, Thy Ocean's Rage, And aid thy Votaries' Flight. FINIS.</field>
