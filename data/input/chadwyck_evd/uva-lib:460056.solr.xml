      <field name="fulltext">? Pœnis agitatus Orestes. Virg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable Sir Robert Walpole.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE; Spoken by Mr. WALKER. In Numbers, sweet as Harmony could form, CIRCE was wont your Fathers' Ears to charm; The fair Inchantress stole on ev'ry Heart; And her Spells triumph'd in the Poet's Art. But then, obsequious to a jingling Age, (When Rhyme, that Clog to Sense, usurp'd the Stage;) The Youthful Bard obey'd the Mode of course, And sacrific'd to Fashion half his Force. With happy Ease he did the Couplets square, But Passion languish'd in the Verse's Care: Enfeebling Rhyme a double Burthen hung; First cramp'd his Pow'rs, and then his Actor's Tongue. But wiser Time has since enlarg'd the Bounds, And chas'd that dull Identity of Sounds. In Mind, and Taste, we threw off servile Sway; At once went Slavery and Rhyme away. Since Custom then has master'd that Restraint, Permit our Bard in freer Lines to paint Circe a-new: And, tho' despoil'd of Rhyme, Allow her Wand, and think her still sublime. If not o'er-partial, or too fondly vain, Our Author may prejudge his humble Strain, He hopes to show some Beauties in Undress; Which, tho' not glaring, may not please the less. Conscious, how hard by Force of Scene to move Your Breasts to Pity, or inflame to Love; He therefore calls up other Charms in Aid; For Song and Dance have Magick to persuade! Rich in these Helps, and in the Painter's Art, He courts Applause, which comes not from the Heart. But if some Gleams of sober Sense appear, Forgive It for What else is blended here.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE, A FORT. Enter Araxes and Barzanes, two Scythian Officers, meeting. Barzanes. Remembrance cannot match th'unquiet Night, So loud this Tempest: In my Walk of Guard, I thought the ruffian Wind would from their Roots Have torn the sturdiest Trees; with such Convulsions They shook, and groan'd, and bow'd their Tops to Earth. Arax. Our Shores felt most its Rage; and still the Sea Runs Mountain-high: If those tall lab'ring Barks, Which by their Bulk and Trim we deem'd of Greece, By Stress of Weather must put in to Land, Let them beware, they touch not on this Coast. Barz. Why of all Ships, that plow the Euxine Sea, Are those of Greece alone deny'd our Shelter? Arax. Know you not that? Such is Diana's Pleasure, The Guardian Goddess of our Scythian Empire; Who, for the Crime of one o'er-daring Man, Pursues a Nation, unappeas'd and wrathful. Barz. Who was this Object of her fatal Spleen? Arax. A Name well noted in our Eastern World, Th'Imperial Agamemnon; whose rash Pride, Or Levity of Spirit, with wanton Boast Prompted his Tongue to challenge Skill Divine; And vie with Dian at th'unerring Bow. Hence her Resentment grew; and when that Chief Embark'd with Greece upon the Trojan War, Their Fleet lay Wind-bound at Eubæan Aulis. The Seers pronounc'd, no Gale could aid their Course, 'Till Iphigenia, Agamemnon's Daughter, Should bleed a Sacrifice at Dian's Altar. Barz. And fell she so? Arax. Reports have varied there. For some give out, that the relenting Goddess, In soft Compassion of the Virgin's Youth, Deign'd to accept a Sacrifice more fit, And snatch'd her from the horrid Shrine, unseen. Barz. A Fate, like this, as oft I've heard it rumour'd, Attends the beauteous Maid, who, all-unwilling, Presides the Priestess at our Tauric Shrine. Arax. I do remember—But howe'er the Goddess Spared the young Maid, her Wrath pursued the Sire For when that Grecian Chief from down-fal'n Troy Return'd in Conquest to his Argive Throne; His Queen, resentful for her Daughter lost, (Butcher'd at Aulis, as Reports avouch'd;) Buried her Dagger in the Victor's Breast. Barz. Horrid Revenge!—But see, the lab'ring Sun, Climbing Heav'n's Hill, relieves us from our Watch. What dreadful Noise! [A Noise as of a Ship striking against Rocks. Arax. It came as from the Shore: Belike, some Ruin of the boist'rous Sea. Enter Riphæus. Riph. A stranger Ship, driv'n by th'unruly Surge, Is bulg'd against our Rocks: The piercing Cries Speak, her Distress is great. With best Dispatch Send down sufficient Force to give them Aid. My Duty hastes me to inform the King. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. Scene changes to an Apartment in the Palace. Enter Thoas and Circe attended. Thoas. Let Business wait the duller Hours of Life, This Day is sacred all to Sports and Joy. 'Tis fit that Triumphs should mark out the Time, Which gave the bright Imperial Circe Birth. Circe. These Honours show'r'd in such Profusion on me, A Subject too unworthy of such Bounties, Swell up my female Bosom with a Pleasure, A Pride, that leaves me destitute of Words, And forces me to pay my Thanks in Blushes. Thoas. Not purple Greatness, not th'extended Sway O'er Scythia's Empire, fill me with such Transport, As 'tis to lay Dominion at thy Feet; As, thus indulg'd, to breathe the Vows of Love, And tell thee, that a heart-sick Monarch sues To make thee Partner of his Bed and Throne. Cir. Alas! you wound me with this kind Excess, And waken Honour to be deaf to Love. Time was, when Circe in her Virgin Bloom, Rich in Dependancies, the Heir of Pow'r, Might claim, and did aspire to sceptred Greatness. But now that Pomp is wither'd, and these Charms Are scanty Dowry for a Monarch's Bed. Thoas. Say rather, they are more than Kings can merit; More than proud Persia, or the out-stretch'd Realms 'Twixt that, and Indus' Shores, have Wealth to purchase. I know, my Empire is too mean a Price In Barter for thy Love; and like a Miser, That sets no Limits to his greedy Wishes, I must be punish'd for too rash Desires, And want the Gem I had not Worth to gain. Cir. Still you will conquer; but instruct my Heart, My grateful Heart, o'ercharg'd with mighty Debt, How not to be injurious, should I yield; Paying thy Bounties with a Bankrupt's Hand. Thoas. All Riches are compriz'd in thy Consent; But, oh, if yet thou fear'st to stand oblig'd, Permit me to assert my rigorous Claim; And, as the Purchase of an unpaid Love, To play the Tyrant, and usurp thy Beauties. Enter Riphæus hastily. Now, whence this haste? Riph. —Tall Ships of War, my Liege, With hostile Preparation make Approach, And darken all the Strand.—High on their Decks Embattled Ranks stand thick; and burnish'd Helms, And glitt'ring Spears, gleam horrid on our Coast. Thoas. In an ill Hour these rash Invaders come To interrupt those Joys, they shall not hinder. Draw out our Forces, line the Beach with Strength; And shew 'em, we're prepar'd to meet their Boldness. [Exit Riphæus. There let 'em grapple with our hardy Scythians, While we, my Queen, attend the nobler Business Of this important Day. Cir. O pardon, Sir; Let Circe rule in this; Lead to your Shores; We'll baffle Danger ere we think of Joy. I've now an Int'rest in your Throne and Person, That longs to shew you what my Art can do To keep Both safe. Thoas. You shall command in all. [Exit Circe led by Thoas. SCENE III. A Port: With a distant Prospect of the Sea, and a Watch-Tower on Rocks. A Peal of Thunder is heard. Enter Orestes and Pylades. Orest. How instant is this Calm! The howling Winds Have spent their Rage; the swelling Waves subside; And all the Wreck of Elements is hush'd. Pylad. And yet, but now, how dreadful was the Tempest! How were we circled with a Night of Clouds! What Bursts of Thunder fell! What Lightnings flash'd! While hoarse conflicting Winds, from Pole to Pole, Rush'd on the Surge, and whirl'd it to the Stars. Orest. When Crimes unequal'd tempt the righteous Gods, 'Tis time, their Vengeance should put on a Form Suiting its Cause.—Behold me, Pylades, Most like this hideous Storm; lawless, and wild, As the rude Winds that lash the Sea to Madness: Clouded with Guilt, that stains the Face of Day; And braving the sweet Sanctity of Heav'n With foulest Parricide. For this, the Furies O'er Sea and Land pursue my wand'ring Steps; For this, a Mother's pale and bleeding Spectre Stalks in my Sight, and blasts me with her Wound; For this, obedient Tempests plow the Main; And urge Destruction on an impious Son. Pylad. Man is the Sport of Fate; and oft Despair, Blinding with Fears our better Judgment, makes us Construe the Purpose of the Gods amiss. Th'Offence, which gives this Rack of Thought, remember, Had first the Sanction of a God's Command; And sacred Phœbus bad you strike the Blow. Orest. Thence only dawns a feeble Ray of Comfort: There all my Hopes of Innocence are shelter'd. Pylad. O could we turn o'er Fate's eternal Volume, And trace the Reasons of its dark Decrees, How might we find the Guilt of buried Fathers Rise on their Offspring, and in them aveng'd! How might we find the Hands of guiltless Sons Made Instruments to scourge their Fathers Trespass! Had Atreus ne'er transgress'd the Laws of Jove, Your Sire, perchance, imperial Agamemnon, Had scap'd the Edge of a domestick Sword; Nor you been warn'd by Piety, and Heaven, To do stern Justice on an impious Mother. Orest. O Pylades, you paint my Crime too fair, And touch it with the Pencil of a Friend. Can I suppose, that Deed was authoriz'd, When Furies haunt my Soul, Storms wreck my Vessels, To mark me out the Hatred of the Gods? Pylad. Yet, spight of Tempests, have you reach'd the Clime, To which th'oraculous Command did point. Did not the awful Voice, in Terms express, Charge you to seek the Coast of Tauric Scythia, Diana's Temple there, and thence to bring Her Statue, which they boast to've dropt from Heav'n? So should the Tumults of your Soul be calm'd, And Rest and Joy succeed to both our Labours. Orest. We have, indeed, the barbarous Tauri reach'd, Where Rest eternal shall conclude my Toils. But I conjure thee in the Name of Friendship, Now while the favouring Breeze invites thy Sails, Fly from this savage, this inhuman Coast; Avoid the Partnership of certain Ruin; And spare thy Friend the Torture of thy Suff'rings. Pylad. What means Orestes? Have we sworn for this, To stand the dread Events of Fate together, And shall a Shew of paltry Danger part us? Orest. Oh! call it not a Shew, an empty Fear; Think on the horrid Law that here prevails. What hapless Grecian, cast on this dire Land, E'er 'scapes from its inhospitable Shore? Mistaken Zeal and murth'rous Superstition Here doom us Victims to the purple Shrine: Here stern Diana is ador'd in Blood, And Altars steam alone with human Gore. Fly, ere the Pomp of Death is drest in Horror; Ere yet the fatal Chaplet binds thy Brow, The solemn Hymn is sung, th'unhallow'd Fires Blaze, or the sacrificing Steel is drawn. Pylad. Then, how have you determin'd? Orest. Here to die: A Wretch devoted to th'infernal Gods. Pylad. My Breast, as yours, is arm'd; and Death is welcome. Orest. No! Thou art destin'd to some whiter Lot: Remember Iphigenia:—O my Sister! If she survives, thy Vows have made thee hers, And thou'rt no longer Master of thy self. Pylad. And would'st thou sacrifice the Royal Maid To him, whose base and abject Heart could stoop Poorly to leave his Friend alone to perish? Orest. Thou hast a Plea t'alledge, that I did order— Pylad. What Friendship and Renown must blush t'obey. O! with what Triumphs would this glorious Flight Honour the Name of Pylades in Greece! How would thy zealous Subjects throng the Gates, To meet this brave Deserter of their Prince! How would the Royal Guardian of your Throne, Old Menelaus, with open Arms receive me; While from behind his beauteous Daughter comes, The bright Hermione, with streaming Eyes, And bleeding Heart, t'applaud my gen'rous Care! Orest. Ha! there thou hast awak'd a sleeping Torture; I feel the Pangs shoot through each vital Part; They sting me to Distraction.—O my Friend! Reflection doubles ev'ry Pain upon me, Sets to my View the Image of my Love, All pale, and languishing, and bath'd in Tears, Her Youth and Freshness sicklied o'er with Grief, And sunk in Anguish of her lost Orestes. O my Hermione! I feel for thee; Thy Sorrows wake me to a righteous Fear, And make me wish this hated Life prolong'd. Pylad. Now thou'rt again thy self.—And see! Occasion Calls to defend the Life we wish prolong'd. [Looking out. Our Landing is espied; and, as it seems, An armed Band advances to surprize us. Orest. Then all is ended; Fate has wound us in; And wills us to submit. Pylad. Submit! To what? Orest. To Custom, and the barb'rous Climate's Law. Pylad. We will contest the Justice of that Law: Force shall oppose their Force. Orest. Alas! how vain Is Opposition, when o'er-match'd with Odds! Pylad. Odds are the Exercise of Heroes' Virtues, And lift them to their own high Rank. Shall we, Who in the Register of both our Bloods Boast Gods enroll'd, stand on Equalities; And weigh the Poise of Danger with the Niceness, The Fears, and the Distrust of common Mortals? It is the great Alternative of Valour To conquer; or, subdued, to die reveng'd. Enter Barzanes, and Scythians: Orestes and Pylades, drawing their Swords, stand on their Guard. Barz. Strangers, submit; and come before our King. Orest. Stand off, presumptuous Men, and know your Danger. Barz. What means this Rashness? See you not our Numbers? 'Tis Desperation, and not Valour, urges To try this frantick, and unequal Struggle. Pylad. Away, or learn what 'tis to match with Greeks. Barz. Yet hold, and spare yourselves the certain Ruin. Orest. How insolent th'undaring Villain talks! Thinks he to prate us into Scythian Fears? We will no longer parley. As they are going to engage, Enter Thoas, and Circe, attended. Thoas. Hold, coward Slaves! Was it not our Command, That you should bring these Strangers bound before us? And could you tremble at such weak Resistance? Give up your Swords, brave Youths: know, 'tis a King Now warns you to submit; nor tempt the Shame Of their inglorious Force. Pylad. Boast you the King? Confess it in the Justice of your Pow'r: Content your self to lord it o'er your own; Nor proudly aim to stretch Controul o'er those, Who are not subject to your Scepter's Sway. Kings, who impose Commands that are unjust, Forfeit that Name to wear the Brand of Tyrants. Thoas. Am I contemn'd? Orest. You are, when you compel us To do an Act would blast a Grecian's Glory. Fearless of Death, we ne'er were taught to yield, But leave that Triumph to your Scythian Baseness. Thoas. Now by the vengeful Goddess, whom we worship, Whose Victims you are doom'd, my Blood is stir'd; And I grow jealous of their noble Daring. Hear me, you Slaves.—Disarm, but hurt them not. [To the Guard. Their Lives are sacred to th'Infernal Gods, And Racks shall expiate the Wounds you give them. Ha! Dastards, stir you not? [Circe waves her Wand, and the Swords of Orestes and Pylades drop out of their Hands.] Circe. What needs the Hazard, The vain Profusion of your Subjects' Blood, When, see, the Strangers yield themselves your Captives? Thoas. And is it thus you Greeks maintain your Boasts? Thus drive Invasion back, and foil the Foe? But this, bright Princess, is your proper Conquest. Orest. Immortal Gods! What mean your dreadful Pleasures? What dire Enchantment works these strange Effects? Whence is it, that the Sword forsakes my Gripe? Whence, that my Strength is wither'd, Nerves unbraced, And Limbs, grown disobedient to the Will, Forget their Vigour, and their natural Function? My Feet are fix'd to Earth, my Knees made weak, And ev'ry Pow'r, but that of Soul, subdued. Pylad. In me, alike, the ministerial Organs Obey the Malice of her baneful Spells; But oh! remember, how we were forewarn'd; And let the sacred Caution give us Safety. This is the Sorc'ress, this the fair Inchanter, Of whom unerring Phœbus bad beware. Guard thee but from the Magick of her Eyes, And all her hellish Charms shall fail to reach us. Thoas. Accept our Thanks, great Daughter of the Sun, Thou worthiest Partner of a Monarch's Bed; I'm lost in Wonder, while I see thy Skill Controuling Nature with a Force above her. Circe. The Gifts I boast are Servants to your Throne, And shall be all employ'd to rear its Grandeur. Come, we unbind the Rigour of our Charm; But know, your hurtful Pow'rs are circumscribed. The Gods do this in scorn of Insolence, And overbearing Courage.—Human Prowess, Presumption stretching it beyond its Bound, Swells Man to Giant; who, but for Reproof, And Curbs to his licentious proud Conceit, Would soar at Heav'n, and make those Thrones unsafe. Orest. Madam, we know your Arts; and you in vain Would cloak the Demon with this fair Instruction. Greece is no Stranger to Thessalian Witchcrafts; And in ourselves we've felt your baneful Pow'r. We're not to learn, what Mischief swells your Breast, And Aspicks' Poisons lurk beneath your Tongue. Thoas. Ha! Straight, our Guard.— Circe. What means my throbbing Heart? Where is my Pride, that I can brook such Language? [Aside. Thoas. Such Arrogance but ill beseems a Slave.— Forgive, fair Queen, the Insults of this Greek. Soon shall his bold, upbraiding Tongue be mute, And he in Death atone the Railer's Outrage. Go, lead them to their Dooms;— Pylad. —Oh my lov'd Friend! Was this the Promise of the righteous Gods? Orest. It matters not: Death is an easy Task To Minds resolv'd, and Life's beneath my Care. [They are led off, guarded. Circe. He must not die. [Aside. His Gallantry and Mien have caught my Soul: And I must stop his Fate, or perish with him. Might I advise,— Thoas. Instruct my wishing Heart What Thought is busy in bright Circe's Mind, And call your Counsel a Command with Thoas. Circe. These Strangers by their Port, and manly Bearing, Betray the Princely Rank: and being such, Your Rites might well admit a single Victim; Nor needs it, Both should die. Thoas. Then be it so. To our fair Priestess we resign their Fate. Conduct them to the Temple straight, with Charge That sep'rate they be lodg'd, and guarded there, Till Lots determine which of them shall bleed; The other shall be free. Circe. Still Fears are active with my doubting Soul: The Lot may fall on him, who must not die. Or, grant him safe, he's lost to Love and Me; And, freed from our inhospitable Bonds, Will wing his Way for Greece. Thoas. The Queen grows thoughtful; And Care drinks up the Lustre of her Eye. What Cause of Gloom dares cloud that Brow of Beauty? [Aside. Circe. You took me, Sir, a poor unscepter'd Exile, Sarmatia's widow'd, titulary Queen; Chas'd by the Malice of resentful Subjects; You more than shelter, place me near your Throne: And Gratitude, the Guest of nobler Hearts, Makes me, perhaps, too anxious for your State. Thoas. Give me your Fears. Circe. I scarce can call them Fears: Let them be rather deem'd unweigh'd Suspicions: And Dangers magnify from female Weakness. What if your Priestess, who on all Occasions With strong Reluctance does her hallow'd Office; Who holds her Life, at best, on hated Terms, Detain'd on Force to tend the Goddess' Shrine; What if she should, being herself a Greek, On Pity's Motive, or in Hate to you, Have Int'rest in these Grecian Pris'ners Lives, And suffer them t'escape your sworn Resentment? Thoas. This kind Concern, built on so slight a Ground, Assures us of the Dearness of your Friendship, And claims our inmost Trust. Accept this Signet, With it our Pow'r.—A Guard attend the Queen. Surround the Temple; watch the doubted Priestess; Make all, that you suspect, impracticable: And bind a King more deeply to your Service. But, oh, the Tribute due to this glad Day Is yet unpaid, and chides my slacken'd Zeal. Lead to the Palace:—Brightest Queen, your Hand. Araxes, see our Will proclaim'd at full. [Exeunt Thoas, Circe, and Train. SCENE IV. A WOOD. Enter Grecian Sailers. 1. Sail. I have plow'd this Euxine Sea these twenty Years, and never saw such a Storm before. 2. Sail. Pox on't. I have made a hard Shift to keep all my Limbs together, I'm sure. And now we are ashore, we look more like a Crew of drown'd Rats, than of Sailers: Nor have we one Drop of our brave Greek Wine left us. The Sea hath swallow'd all that down at one Draught. 1. Sail. But what's become of our Leaders? 3. Sail. They are safe on Shore. 2. Sail. Pylades is looking after some Temple of Venus to offer up his Vows at, I warrant you. Pox on all Love-Voyages, I say. They seldom end better.— What needs a Grecian run the Venture of drowning for a foreign Mistress, when there are so many Women in his own Country ready to drown themselves for Want of Lovers? 1. Sail. Methinks, Brother, Venus ought to take a little more Care of her own Votaries. 2d Sail. Why, what hath Venus to do with your honourable Lovers?—If We had been running away with some rich Citizen's Wife, the good Goddess would have kept the Sea as smooth as her own Bosom. For, look'ee, Friend, Venus is a wise Goddess, and knows the Good of her Worshippers better than they do themselves: She knows, when a Man is sailing to the Coast of Matrimony, 'tis often better for him to be drown'd than to arrive at it. 3. Sail. Ay, if he were to meet with such a Wife as your piece of Comfort, we grant it: One, that a Man had better be at Sea in a Storm, than at home in a Calm with. 2. Sail. That's too true:—Yet if ever I make another Voyage, I'll bring her with me, I am resolv'd on it. And then if a Storm should arise, I should lose all Fear of my own drowning, in Hopes of seeing her drown'd. Enter Pilot. Pilot. What, have you forgot our Wreck already, ye idle Varlets? Have you forgot your Ship, before she is cold in her Grave, as a Man may say? 2. Sail. Good Words, Master Pilot: As for our Ship, rest her Soul, if she be gone: And how she went, do You and the Storm answer between You. 1. Sail. Ay, ay: Who should answer for a Ship's sinking but the Pilot? 3. Sail. I suppose, you'd have had us weather'd it upon the Rocks where you steer'd us. Pilot. No, you lazy, lubberly Rascals; but I would have you strive to save what you can, before the Natives come down upon us. 2. Sail. Natives! here are no Natives. There's no Sign of any Houses, but those that the Gods live in; and, sure, they have too much Piety towards themselves, to plunder poor Mortals in their Misfortunes. Pilot. Sirrah, you'll find that those Temples have Priests in them, who plunder all Mankind out of Piety; take nine Parts to themselves, and give the Gods the Tithe. 3. Sail. Priests! What, are there Priests here as well as in Greece? Pilot. Yes; and where ever there's a Land like this for 'em to graze in. They're no more to be kept out of a rich Soil, than Weeds are. 1. Sail. Well, much good may't do them with their Plunder.—If they have Power enough with the Gods to make the Sea refund our Treasure, 'tis more than we have. 2. Sail. Nay, that's past a Doubt. The good Moveables are lost to the right Owners: And it's all one to us, whether the Priests, or their Gods, the Sea, or the Devil, have 'em. Pilot. How natural is it for a little ill Fortune to make such cravenly Wretches wicked!—For shame, come down to the Shore and let us save what we can. Without the Recovery of our Ship, how do you hope to be transported back to your Native Country? Would you lie down and die like fainting Cowards, or suffer your selves to live here the Slaves of Barbarians? 3. Sail. The Circumstances are very moving, that's the Truth on't: But we have no great Courage at undertaking Labour in vain. Pilot. If nothing else could charm you to your Duty, methinks, those Casks of generous Wine, which now lie floating to the Shore, should tempt you to preserve them. 2. Sail. How! Is there any Hope of our Liquor surviving? Lead on, Master Pilot. Shew me the delicious Prospect but of one floating Cask, and I'll recover it, or sink with it. Omnes. Ay, ay, we'll all down to the Shore on that Promise. Pilot. Come on, then; and, if it must be so, your villanous Debaucheries be the Spur to your Duty. 2. Sail. Well, well; shew us but the good Liquor, and then see if you can rail us out of our Affection to it. Exeunt. SCENE V. A Palace. Thoas and Circe discover'd, attended. Singers and Dancers rang'd down each Side of the Stage. Chorus of Singers. Great Mithra! God of Light! adorn With choicest Beams this sacred Morn: For Her impart thy brightest Ray, Whose Lustre emulates thy Sway. Beauty, like Light, was form'd to charm; Like Light, we feel its Influence warm; Then gild, bright God, thy purple Sphere; While Circe shines a Goddess here. [After the Song and Dances, Thoas and Circe rise and come forward.] Thoas. Break up the Sports:—Your Mind, I see, employed On weightier Cares, tastes not these idle Pleasures. Circe. Indeed, my Bosom is oppress'd with Fears, That relish Mirth but ill.—Those scatter'd Ships May brave the Tempest out, and yet invade you. Thoas. Let not their impotent Attacks give Fear: The two presumptious Youths, who wear our Bonds, Were Spies upon the Weakness of our Throne: But one shall dearly rue the rash Attempt. To-morrow's Sun shall see the Victim bleed; That done, the Pomp of Hymen shall succeed. Oh, my fair Queen! the promis'd Bliss I claim, And burn with an unpractis'd Lover's Flame. Love rages in my Breast; tho' Time has shed His Marks of Winter, and made hoar my Head: As Mountains with imbowell'd Sulphur glow, While their bleak Tops are cover'd o'er with Snow. [Exeunt. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. SCENE, A Vault in the Temple of Diana, with Lamps burning. Orestes discover'd sleeping on a Couch. Harsh Musick. Three Furies rise and sing. 1st Fury. He sleeps; serene the Murth'rer sleeps; And triumphs in a Mother slain: While all aloof stern Justice keeps, and we pursue his Guilt in vain. 2d Fury. But shall he rest, and I possess this Snake? 3d Fury. No; dart it to his Breast, and shake His inward Soul; and Dread, and conscious Horrors wake. 2d Fury. I'll sting him, till his Pangs to Frenzy rise; Till his own Hand the vengeful Stroke supplies. 3d Fury. How should we laugh to see him slain, So doubly black with Murther's Stain! 1st Fury. Then all at once we'll rear The dreadful burning Spear, And drive him down to Realms of Woe, Ten thousand, thousand, Fathoms low: To the remotest Glooms of Hell, Where Souls of blackest Dye, In Shame, from Ghosts less guilty fly; And only Murth'rers dwell. Orestes, waking, starts up hastily. Orest. Avaunt! Be gone! Tie up your cruel Scorpions, Ye all detested Hags! Demons of Night! Descend to burning Lakes, your Seats of Birth, And rid my Breast of this intestine Hell. Be gone! and tell th'unrighteous Pow'rs you serve, Th'Infernal Gods, my dread Revenge was just. [The Furies sink, and the Ghost of Clytemnestra rises. Ha! I have said too much!—Come back, ye Furies; Daughters of Rage, come back; and I will fix My Eye-balls on you, till I'm blind with Horrors: For here's an Object, makes the Sense of Seeing Rebel against itself.—Well; shew thy Wound, Whose Blood is cold; glare on me with those Eyes, Whose Beams of Sight are quench'd; I own, I kill'd thee; But strict Command urg'd my reluctant Hand: And the absolving Gods, who will'd the Deed, Must quit me of the Crime. Ghost. Never, Orestes: Heav'n doom'd not, but thy sacrilegious Will Forg'd a pretended Purpose of the Gods; And nought can clear thee, but avenging Justice. No Ease shall crown thy Days, no Rest thy Nights; But ghastly Visions, and heart-sick'ning Dread, Shall chill thy Veins, and poison all thy Pleasures. The Guilt of Parricide, with conscious Stings Lashing thy Mind, shall keep awake Despair; Pall thy best Appetite o'er the mirthful Bowl, And blast Fruition in the Bed of Joy. Anguish, in ev'ry Form, shall haunt thy Soul; And when thy Spirits are lull'd to seeming Peace, I, and my Wound, shall rouse the sleeping Frenzy, And make thee curse a Life thou can'st not lose. [Here the Ghost sinks. Orest. Must it be thus?—Then Piety's a Crime; Obedience to the Gods of fatal Moment; And Heav'n is wrathful, when it dictates to us. Unrighteous Pow'rs! Withhold your dire Commands; And, without Guilt, permit us to be wretched. O Father, wherefore was it not in Fate That I should mourn, and not revenge, thy Death? I could have born the Pangs of Sorrow well, And in my Grief avow'd the pious Son. But Murther—Parricide—O! there lies Madness,— Distraction,—Torture,—agonizing Fears.— The Priestess—Ha! My Thoughts again recoil; Enters Iphigenia. And furnish out a Scene of new Distraction. Is it the Coinage of o'er-busy Fancy? The dreadful Pageantry of inward Fears? Or does my cooler Sense present these Horrors? Such was the Form, and such th'aspiring Gate, The Mien majestick, and the aweful Eye, Of my Imperial Mother.—Horror wounds me. Iphig. Stranger, condemn not in your Thoughts my Tongue, That hates the Tidings, I am forc'd to bring: The fatal Lot of Death— Orest. Is fall'n on me. I am prepar'd: lead to the destin'd Altar. There, Gods, your juggling Promises shall end; That flatter to the Ear, and cheat the Soul. Iphig. He must be Grecian by this noble Daring.— How have the Pow'rs oppress'd your Youth with Woe, That Life's become your Plague? This Unconcern,— This Zeal of pressing into Death's dark Cave, Seems as you did contemn the Gods best Gift, And wish'd to lay the irksome Burthen down. Orest. Tho' yet my Years should speak the Bloom of Spring, Dry Sorrows have drunk up my Sap of Youth, And all my Leaves are shed. Know too, fair Maid, A Grecian holds not Life of dear Account, But whilst his Pow'r remains to serve his Country. Despoil'd of that Renown, all second Fame, All meaner Joys make Life not worth our Care. Iphig. Then Friendship holds no place in Grecian Breasts, Insensible alike to that and Love. Orest. Have I said aught to merit that Reproach? To speak me dull to Nature's choicest Touches? Forgive me, Beauty, who have felt thy Charms: Forgive me, sacred Friendship, that have tasted The Partnership of all thy dearer Int'rests. Ev'n now my glowing Bosom swells with Joy, To think, my Death shall save the best of Friends, And loose his Virtue from indecent Bonds. Oh! Might I be indulg'd once more to see him, And breathe the Transports of my Soul before him, I should embrace my Fate with ample Pleasure. Iphig. Stranger, your Friend prevents you in that Wish; Unknowing, whom the fatal Lot has doom'd, Already he, with pity-moving Tears, And with Knees bent as to the Gods for Succour, Has at my Feet pour'd forth his strong Desire, To taste the Comfort of a last Embrace. Orest. And is it possible, his Suits' obtain'd? Has Pity won so far? Iphig. —Mistake not, Youth, Nor think my Soul stern as my hated Office. I am, like you, a Greek; like you, unhappy; Enquire not from what Source:—Let it suffice, I feel such tender Sentiments within, Were you my Brother, more I could not pity. Orest. Such Kindness to repay, may you be happy As Heav'n can make you! Happier than that Maid, Who must in me mourn a lost Brother's Fate! Iphig. Instant, your Friend shall greet you; but be warn'd, (For Mercy is esteem'd a Crime in me, And I'm suspected by my cruel Guardians;) If you regard his Safety, fear his Danger: And make your Conf'rence short. Orest. We will observe; And, thus oblig'd, count it our Bond t'obey you. [Exit Iphigenia. What Majesty she wears!—and such a Sweetness Breaks from her, as enrich'd my Mother's Smiles, While yet she clasp'd me in the Folds of Love. Reflection brings the Image strong to View, And turns my Eyes into my Soul with Wonder. But Friendship comes to chase the painful Thought, And cheer my Bosom with a better Object. Enter Pylades. O Pylades! Thou Partner of my Soul! Thou better Half! Come to my aking Breast, And give me to My self.—Ha! whence this Coldness, Those down-cast Eyes, and this dumb Pomp of Sorrow? Why do thy Arms fall languid back from mine, Nor grasp me with the noble Rage of Friendship? Pylad. What shall I say, or how excuse my Treason? [Aside. Orest. Let us not now grow Truants to Renown, And forfeit the great Praise of mutual Fondness. We, that have liv'd the Patterns to our Age, From whom aspiring Youths have copied Faith, Should hold the gen'rous Ardour to the last; And stand the Monuments to After-times, How we could love, and how in Death we parted. Pylad. O think not that the Flames of Friendship languish: That Time, or Chance could banish thee my Heart. Youthful Desire ne'er met untasted Beauty With stronger Ardour, than I meet thy Love. Yet tho' I can in that avow my Faith, Still I'm a Recreant turn'd to thee and Honour: False as Inconstancy, and wav'ring Baseness; And undeserving of thy kind Embrace. Orest. Why wilt thou wound my Ears with Something horrid, I'm taught to dread, yet know not how t'interpret? Pylad. Hear Me then (for therein the Gods are just;) Expound the Secret of my own Disgrace. Know you to whom we owe, that now we've met? Orest. Why not? The good, th'indulgent Priestess gave it To thy bent Knee, and supplicating Eyes. Pylad. I blush to think that thou do'st know my Treachery. Those Tears, I shed, should have burnt out mine Eyes, When my false suppliant Tongue, and my bow'd Knee, Were Prostitutes to Shame. Orest. Then you repent The Cause, that did employ your Zeal; and own, The lost Orestes was not worth your Pray'r. Pylad. Still wide;—I must my self unfold my Guilt. The Priestess— Orest. What of her? Pylad. Have I not sworn To keep this Heart for Iphigenia's Charms? Was I not all the Royal Virgin's due? Yet now a Traitor to those awful Vows, I've gaz'd away my Faith. The lovely Priestess (Forgive me, that I still must call her so;) Has stol'n into the Temple of my Breast, And fill'd the Dome with sacrilegious Love. How wilt thou punish this disloyal Friend?— Orest. No more:—My Sorrows leave no Room for Anger; Poor Iphigenia! Who shall now befriend Thee? Pylad. Yet while I own the Crime, I could not shun, Something may be to Gratitude allow'd: For whilst I knelt and trembled at her Feet, My Heart then beating in the Cause of Friendship, She, with a Look sweet as the Paphian Queen, And Voice more soft than Philomel's Complaint, Wish'd, it had ne'er been my disast'rous Fate To tread this dang'rous and inhumane Soil; Or that it might be her's, to give me Safety. But see!—the dear inchanting Virgin comes: Now shield me in thy Bosom from her Eyes, That, like Perfumes, o'ercome the Sense with Sweetness. Orest. No, we must part:—Perhaps, to meet no more! [Aside. Enters Iphigenia hastily. Iphig. Strangers, by virtue of the Royal Signet, With Steps, importing haste, the Queen approaches; And with a Guard has circled round the Dome. You must retire at once; or, disobeying, [To Pylades. Danger will double on yourself and Friend. Orest. Away.— Pylad. What! go, without my Pardon seal'd? Were it to die, still I would die forgiv'n. Iphig. You may anon debate with better Safety.— Orest. Away—one Moment's Pause ensures my Death. Pylad. Forbid it, Jove!—farewell. [Pylades goes out with Iphigenia. Orest. Eyes, take your last, Your latest Prospect of the best of Friends: Who knows not, he no more shall view Orestes. Enters Circe. Circe. Pity, that soars above Resentment's Rage In gen'rous Minds, has sent an injur'd Queen To say, she grieves that you are doom'd to die; Nay more, to proffer you her saving Aid, (So you consent,) and point the way to Safety. Orest. Madam, I came not to this Scythian Coast, Unknowing of your Death-denouncing Law: Sent by the Gods, unless their Aid protect me, I yield to Fate, and am prepar'd to die. Circe. Then recognize in me the Gods Protection: Alas! You doubt my Pow'r, or Will, to save you; And think I wear my feeble Sex's Vengeance. But know, I am above a common Female; And boast a Mind divine as is my Race: Circe my Name: The Daughter of the Sun. Orest. Circe!— Circe. Yes, sprung from that eternal Sire, The God infus'd me with his choicest Flames. Yes, potent in his Gifts, the watry Car Of his pale Sister feels my strong Command. By him the Pow'rs of ev'ry baleful Juice, Each binding Charm, are servile to my purpose: While by Effects, that startle Nature's Course, I make the gazing World suspect her Laws. Orest. Yes; the Circæan Bowl and Wand are known, E'er since the wise Ulysses 'scap'd your Snares: Whose hapless Mates, debas'd from human Form, And human Sense, around your Palace-Walls, Howl'd like Night-Wolves, or eat the Draff of Swine. Circe. Well did that State beseem their grov'ling Souls, Brutal, and tastless of sublimer Joys. But wise Ulysses, capable of Bliss, Aspir'd to me, and reap'd unfading Pleasures. Yet then, ev'n when Delight was at its Flood, Fearing, lest his slack State should ebb at home, Who, but this Circe, lent a prosp'rous Gale To waft the Hero to his native Throne? Be thou like my Ulysses.— Orest. Perish rather! Circe. Give me not Cause to think too poorly of Thee: If thou canst scorn this undecaying Youth, This Bloom of Charms, that Monarchs sigh to gain, Yet shew thee wise; dissemble thy fixt Hate; A trivial Recompence for Life preserv'd. Say but thou wilt receive that Gift from me, Then curse me after; throw me to Neglect; Do any thing Ingratitude shall prompt Thy savage Heart to do, to make me wretched. Orest. Avaunt, Inchantress!—I am deaf as Adders; Deaf as Ulysses to the Siren's Song, Who strove in vain to lure him to Destruction. Aim all your Knives, ye Ministers of Blood; Willing I come thy Victim, stern Diana! [As Orestes goes out, Thoas enters behind. Cir. Then perish, obstinate and virtuous Fool! Yet—die he must not.—Something here within Shakes my Resolve, and shudders at that Thought. To be reveng'd, is Vengeance on my self. Thoas. Ha! parlying with our Captive, and alone, When his Doom's fixt!—Is this her Zeal for me? This her Distrust?—'Tis all as I suspected: The Wanton counts me in the Vale of Years, And seeks a Paramour of younger Pow'rs. Madam, you seem disturb'd:—I hope, our Priestess Was not in League to let the Victims 'scape; Or has the haughty Greek, whose stubborn Soul Disdains to bend, tho' Queens should stoop to sooth him, With Insolence renew'd provok'd this Tempest? Cir. This unweigh'd Jealousy shews me, in time, The Tyrant you would prove, had I resign'd The Pow'r to make you so. Thoas. Ungrateful Queen! Tho' Love be blind, Suspicion will have Eyes; And reason on th'apparent Face of Truth. You scatter'd Doubts in my too credulous Breast, That, as a Greek, our Priestess might incline To favour Greeks; and rob our Sacrifice. Th'Event proclaims, that was a groundless Fear: The Greek by her impartial Lot is doom'd, And waits, this Hour, to pay his forfeit Life. Cir. Dull, and o'erweening King! Go, take your Victim; Assist the juggling Train laid for your Ruin; And think th'Election, and the Lot, impartial. 'Tis plain, the chosen Victim is a Prince. The Priestess sees, with what imperious Threats Of Havock his fierce Bands demand him back; And, secret, triumphs in your sworn Defeat. What hopes she less, than, when their hardy Rage Shall make Reprisals for the rash-spilt Blood, To find Conveyance to her native Soil? The Crime will center all in you; and she Stand, in their Eyes, an Instrument compell'd, A Mourner for the Deed. Thoas. —O proper Stuff, As superficial, as your Guilt is open! This labour'd Web of aukward Policy Too thinly covers o'er the bad Deceit; And sets your treach'rous Passion out to View. 'Tis known, for whom you would preserve this Prince. Circe. Rather 'tis known, to what opprobrious End You labour to excuse your subtle Vestal. Thoas. Recrimination is the mean Resource Of self-convicted Spirits, of conscious Guilt Refining on Detection. But beware; Spight of my Love, and your imperious Charms, I will assert the King in my Revenge. Circe. Spight of your Threats, you dare not, shall not do it. Take back the Pow'r you poorly seem'd to lend; [Throwing his Signet. Attempt whate'er your Fears will give you leave: Ev'n when your Swords are levell'd at his Breast, I'll come with watchful, unforeseen, Prevention; And disappoint the Malice of your Anger. [Exit Circe. Thoas. By Heav'n, I will not trust a Moment's Leisure To your infernal Arts. Go, speed the Rites; Our Priests, on Peril of their Lives, be ready. I'll see the pleasing Stroke of Vengeance giv'n. Tho' my Life's Bliss, the Safety of my Throne, Rested on this one Act of Rage undone; Better, all sink into the common Grave, Than tamely live to be a Woman's Slave. [Exit Thoas.

'Twas not a Dream; full to my waking Sense The Goddess stood confest: Her Form and Grace Still strong to View; and still I seem to hear The awful Accents of her grave Command. “Hermione, said she, if yet the Care “Of thy betroth'd Orestes touch thy Mind, “That gallant Youth, thy Royal Grandsire's Choice, “Thy destin'd Husband, if the Fates be firm, “Swift to the Scythian Tauri speed thy way; “Where Dangers thicken round his princely Head. “Sparta obeys thee in thy absent Sire, “And, glad, shall send the delegated Vessels. “Go forth; and know, whate'er the Gods have purpos'd, “Whether 'tis giv'n you to ensure his Safety, “Your Stars are equal, and your Fortunes blended. Laod. That he was shipwreck'd on this barb'rous Coast, By Drift of Circumstance seems well avouch'd: But whether he escap'd the boist'rous Wave, Whether 'tis he now wears the Scythian Bonds, There Rumour's at a Loss. Herm. And Fears suggest, O dear Laodice, a Fate of Horrors. Thence big Discomfort swells, thence flows a Train Of startling Doubts, and Hope grows sick to Death. Perhaps, the Billows, piteous of his Woes, Lent him a secret Grave, in kind Prevention. Perhaps, (more frightful Thought!) in hideous Pomp The crimson Shrine has drunk his streaming Blood. What then for lost Hermione remains? What but to die, and bid adieu to Terrors? Laod. The pitying Gods avert that fatal Doom, Nor wound their Sparta with so dear a Loss! [Musick is heard. Herm. Ha! whence these sudden Strains? this airy Charm? What strange Musician wantons with my Sorrows? [Pallas descends in a Chariot of Clouds. Pallas. Look up, bright Maid, and see What Pow'r is watchful o'er thy Fate; Pallas, that still thro' wayward Turns presides Patron of Virtue, and the Hero's Guard. Thy dear Orestes lives; but holds His Life in doubtful Scale: In Bonds the gallant Youth's detain'd, The destin'd Victim of Diana's Shrine. Herm. Then all is lost Pallas. —Repress thy Fears: And to yon Dome, whose brazen Gates Confront thy View, now bend thy Steps: Inquire the Priestess; trust her with thy Fortune; Fate and the Gods may smile.—I must no more: 'Tis yours t'exert each Pow'r of Soul, And shew the Heav'ns that you deserve their Aid. Air. 'Tis Virtue's Task to conquer Fate, And make Disaster bow: Then think, the Gods in Wisdom hate Their choicest Works t'undo. For at thy Birth, O virtuous Fair, Two Goddesses were join'd; Thy Beauties Venus made her Care, And Pallas form'd thy Mind. [Pallas ascends. Herm. Thanks, sacred Pallas, best belov'd of Jove! Thy Deity still by me revered and blest! How hast thou planted Comfort round my Heart, And made the gloomy Prospect gay within! Goddess of Arms and Wisdom, lend thy Strength, Thy Conduct to me, thro' this Maze of Fate. Help to make mild thy sterner Sister's Wrath, Dian, whose Virgin Liv'ry yet I wear, Whose Altar now I seek; whose dread Resentment With heaving Sighs of Woe, and streaming Eyes I bow to deprecate.—If Virtue's Cause Of Right from heav'nly Minds Compassion draws; If bending Grace our melting Sorrows chears, 'Tis ours to weep, so Mercy dwell in Tears. [Exeunt Hermione and Laodice. [[SCENE II.]] SCENE Opens to the inward Part of the Temple. An Image of Diana with a Bow and Quiver is seen. An Altar with a Fire on it. Priests attending. Enter Iphigenia. Iphig. Fate urges on the black, tremendous Moment; Impatient of Delay, the Scythian Tyrant Demands the Rites, and raves aloud for Blood. Oh! wherefore am I weak with Woman's Fears? Why have I not the noble daring Soul To brave the fierce Barbarian's stern Commands, And earn from him that Wound, I dread to give? 'Tis base to shrink at Guilt, yet fear to die, And shun the Perpetration of that Guilt. Conscience, that makes us Cowards in Offence, Should make us valiant to avoid a Crime. Inhuman Goddess! Blood-demanding Queen! Dart thy fell Shafts at this devoted Breast, Which stands reluctant to the Task of Death, And hates the Business of thy savage Shrine. I shake to lift the executing Steel, With such an Horror as its murth'ring Point Were turn'd on One, that twinn'd with me in Birth. [A Sound of flat Trumpets within. Ha! the hoarse Trumpet gives the dreadful Summons. The hideous Rites come on, th'unhallow'd Flames Rise on the Altar, and demand the Victim. Orestes and Pylades are brought in bound from opposite Quarters of the Stage, attended by Priests. Iphig. They come: Distraction!—teach me, righteous Gods, How shall I not pronounce the Doom of Death, Yet save the Man I love? Aside. Pylad. Most charming Maid! I'll spare your Tongue the all-displeasing Task [To Iphigenia. Of pointing out a Wretch, that waits his Doom.— Come, bind my Brow with your infernal Chaplets; And I will wear them as the Wreaths of Triumph. Orest. What means my Friend? Pylad. To save the best of Men; And by my Death attone my past Offence. Orest. It must not be:—Scythians, the Lot is mine: Wilful, foreknowing your sworn Hate to Greece, I entred in Despight your hostile Clime; And fearless court the Death, I thus provok'd. Pylad. Alas! he raves:—The gallant, luckless Youth Beneath my Banners came to wage the War; By Friendship only seconding my Crime. If you aspire to wreak your Hate on Greece, Do it on him, who, did not these curst Bonds Controul my Rage, purpos'd the like on you. Enter Thoas, attended. Behold me, with determin'd Soul, your Foe; And those tall Barks, that threaten now your Coast, Wait my Command to pour Destruction on you. I know, my faithful Troops will soon revenge me; And, in that Knowledge, I defy your Rage: Nay, it behoves you to be quick in Act, Or they will snatch me from your baffled Malice. Thoas. Whence this Delay? What mean th'unmanner'd Priests To loiter thus? Begin the Sacrifice. Orest. Cease, cease, my Friend, the unavailing Contest, And leave me to my Fate. Be thine this Glory; Report me, how I took the Stroke of Death, Then head my Subjects to revenge their Prince, And wrest the Sceptre from his Tyrant Hand. Thoas. Extravagance of Daring!—Doubly brav'd! Can Death have Charms to justify this Strife?— Pylad. Now by thy Father's injur'd Shade, I beg, By all th'Endearments of our Friendship past, By that big Glory my Soul pants to earn, Forego thy Claim: or, hear me, awful Justice! And witness, Jove!—I will not live behind thee. Orest. No more:—It must not be. Tyrant, proceed. Pylad. Proceed:—We both are Grecians, Princes both, And both alike contemn thy Pow'r and Thee. Iphig. Where will this glorious, dreadful Contest end! Thoas. Their Insolence demands that Both should die; Yet, since our Sentence was, that one should 'scape, (And one stands foremost in our Eye of Hate;) We will begin the Work of Vengeance, where Th'Election of our hallow'd Urn directs it. Straight with our Garlands bind the Victim's Brow; And to our Priestess give the solemn Steel. [The Priests crown Orestes, and lead him towards the Altar. One offers the Knife to Iphigenia. A Peal of Thunder is heard. The Flame on the Altar goes out. Priest. Avert these Omens, Heav'n! the sick'ning Flame, All fierce before, starts from the sacred Brands, Now dead and unsusceptible of Fire. Thoas. On with the Rites; rekindle the sunk Flame: And with fresh Zeal appease the wrathful Goddess. Priest. Urge not our Zeal, 'till better Omens offer. Thoas. Pernicious Caitiffs! I shall find a Time To make you fear an injur'd Monarch's Wrath: Ye Coward Herd! Give me the sacred Knife; I'll execute her Vengeance and my own. [As Thoas snatches the Knife, and goes to stab Orestes, two Dragons rise out of the Earth, and bear him away; and Circe appears above in her Chariot, drawn by Dragons. O spight of Hell! Confusion! Disappointment! This is the Working of the Sorc'ress Queen, Injurious Circe, that ungrateful Spoiler, Who thus repays my Benefits with Wrongs; Slights my sworn Vows, and her own plighted Faith; And in the Face of Heav'n, in Shame to Virtue, Affronts my Majesty, and robs my Vengeance. Circe. Rail on, and curse that Stubbornness of Purpose, Which would presume with impotent Efforts To cross my Will. Be Jealousy thy Plague! Yet, in despight of weak, ill-judging Passion, I'll save thee from the Dangers of thy Spleen; And guard a Throne, thy Rashness aims to ruin. [Circe is carried off in her Chariot. Thoas. False, false Adult'ress! this is but the Painting, The Varnish of thy soul, luxurious Guilt. Injurious Gods! why made you me a King, Yet arm'd my sceptred Hand with Pow'r no better Than that, which Nature's meanest Drudges boast? O, for the Thunderbolt of darting Jove! That I might reach the Traitress in her Flight, Now, now, she trains him to the magick Bower: But I'll pursue her, tho' to Hell she lead him. Suspend the Rites, 'till we regain the Minion; All Vengeance now displeases, but on her. [Exit Thoas attended. Iphig. You righteous Pow'rs, that from your awful Thrones Look down with Pity, when our Pray'rs are just; Thanks to your Virtues, that have yet prorogued The dreadful Thought-affrighting Hour, and sav'd Poor Iphigenia from the Crime of Blood. Pylad. What do I hear? O Transport!—Do I wake? Or are my Senses charm'd with sweet Delusion? It must be she; her Majesty of Form, Beauties unparagon'd, and gen'rous Pity, Are Proofs most pregnant of the Royal Maid. Did you not say, your Name was Iphigenia? Iphig. I did, but what of that? Such was my Name, While better Fortune made it worth Remembrance: I would forget it now: And much I fear, Your Raptures suit but ill your lost Condition. Pylad. Where is my Friend? Return him, ye just Gods! And let me to his Ear transport the Tidings, Then do your mighty Pleasures. Iphig. Can it be, (Inform my Wonder, if it errs;) that you, Who would have dy'd in Ransom of your Friend, Should wish him back to a fresh Scene of Horrors? Pylad. Hold; yet instruct me farther, heav'nly Maid; For I am wrapt in Wonder deep as you. That you're of Greece, I've heard; where just Report Spoke loud ere-while of Agamemnon's Name. She weeps,—and ev'ry precious Tear that falls Is rich with Confirmation!—That great Chief, In Death ill-fated, left one princely Son, Orestes nam'd:— Iphig. My Brother!—Bless him, Heav'n! If yet he lives, fall Glories thick upon him! Nor let my hapless Fortunes reach his Ear, To wound him with a Grief! Pylad. 'Tis she:—O Joy! Let Ecstasy pronounce it to my Soul, Remorse is at an End; I've now no Pardons To ask of Friendship for a misplac'd Love. My Eyes and Heart, unknowing, follow'd Fate; And felt the Influence of the destin'd Charmer. Iphig. Stranger, your Words seem big with mighty Meaning, Some Birth of Fate, lab'ring to be disclos'd, That keeps aloof from Sense: their mystick Tenour Dark as the Raptures of prophetick Seers, Yet fraught, like Oracles, with wond'rous Import. Pylad. I fear, I've said too much; this austere Guard, These Men, that should be holy,— Iphig. Fear not them; They are, like Me, reluctant to these Rites; Servants of Virtue, tho' constrain'd to Guilt. I know, they will in faithful Silence bury Whate'er you utter. Pylad. Then there's yet a Hope. But oh! let's move from this portentous Shrine, Here Horror keeps her State,—to that lone Isle, My first kind Prison, where I knelt before thee, And found thee pitying as Jove's best-lov'd Mercy. There, in Requital, I'll unfold a Tale, Shall sooth thy Heart with Scenes of op'ning Joy: Which these good, venerable, Men shall join To think the Promise, and the Work, of Heav'n; And catch the Omens of our dawning Rescue. [Exeunt Pylades, and Iphigenia, Priests following. SCENE III. A Fort. Enter the Sailers. 3. Sail. If the Sea had but refunded us one more Runlet, I would have been contented. 2. Sail. Ay, one more Runlet to have regaled ourselves with, whilst our Leaders are lost, and our Pilot busied in refitting our Vessels; and let Fate have done its worst. 1. Sail. Confound the Sea! It is more greedy than a Greek Usurer. 2. Sail. Look'ee, Friends, make your selves easy. The Sea will be damnable drunk with our Wine; and if it could play us such Tricks while it was sober, what must we expect when it grows drunk? For my part, I am ev'n for staying at Land, and becoming a Man of another Element. While we are sober, d'ee see, let us know when we are well, and stay here and plant a Colony.—Never mind what precise Fools tell you of Country. One Country is as good as another. 3. Sail. Very true:—Thou speak'st like a very wise Man indeed:—and thy Sobriety bespeaks it self. 2. Sail. Do I not? For no wise Man ever car'd a Fig for his Country. 1. Sail. Unless he had an Estate in it, Dorax.— 2. Sail. Very true! For why should a Man value a Country which he is a Slave in? And in all the Countries in which I have ever been, I have found the Poor to be no better than Slaves to the Rich. Now here, d'ee see, we shall be the greatest Men in our Country. 1. Sail. I have but one Thing to urge against your Design, and that is, how to satisfy two whoreson Appetites I have of Eating and Drinking. For as we shall live very free, whilst we have no one to enslave us; so shall we live very hungry, whilst we have nothing to eat. 2. Sail. Pshaw! Never fear, Man; we shall find Fish, Flesh, and Fowl enough, I warrant you; and if the Climate do but produce the generous Grape— 3. Sail. But there's another more whoreson Appetite of mine, which must be supply'd. In short, Friend, I would have a Posterity to leave the Fruits of our Labours to. 2. Sail. Never fear a Want of Women, Boy. As soon as the Fame of our Colony reaches Greece, we shall have 'em trooping over hither by Wholesale to make their Fortunes. For my part, I am more afraid of seeing my first Wife again, than of not getting a second. 1. Sail. Well then, we are agreed to stay here, and plant a Colony? 2. Sail. Agreed! What else? What a Pleasure will it be to us, when we grow rich and powerful, to receive Ambassadors from our quondam Country to sollicit our Alliance; ay, and sometimes to make 'em pay for it? For I must tell you, I intend to insist on very high Terms, whatever Side I declare my self of. 1. Sail. You! Pree'thee, Dorax, do not talk altogether in the Singular Number: We are to be a Commonwealth, and every Man shall have an equal Vote. 3. Sail. Ay, ay, all upon a Level. I'll suffer no Man to be greater than my self. 1. Sail. But hold you, hold you, Fellow-Statesmen; and let us settle one material Point before hand. How shall this Commonwealth of ours be kept on foot without Money? 2. Sail. Why there's it now. Ev'n confess yourself shallow, and stand instructed.—Without Money, you say? Why, we'll run deeply in Debt to one another, and so grow rich. Every politick State in Greece is in its readier Course towards Prosperity, by so much more as it owes; as that Ship makes her faster Way to Port, who has already spent all her Stock of Biscuit. Do not you see now, Gentlemen, how necessary it will be to have such a wise Man as I am at your Head to direct your Councils. Enter Pilot. Pilot. Fly, fly, my Friends; the Scythians are alarm'd, and make in Bodies toward the Shore to surprize us. Our only Hope to escape from Slavery is by our instant Flight. 2. Sail. Flight? a Plague on't, had ever young Commonwealth so untimely an End! What a hopeful Prize is here run adrift, before we could have time to board her! Pilot. Away, Drunkard. Our Leaders are taken by the Foe: As we shall be, if we don't immediately prevent it. Away, away. 1. Sail. Would I were well landed in Greece again, tho it were thro' another Storm! 2. Sail. And would I were well supply'd with Drink, and I would fix the Colony, and govern here by my self! [Exeunt. [[SCENE IV.]] SCENE changes to Circe's Bower. Enter Orestes. Orest. Was I, indeed, snatch'd from the dreadful Shrine? Or did I suffer there, and wafted thence To better Life, now tread th'Elysian Plains? It must be so; for all is here Perfection. This seems that verdant, never-fading Soil, Where Heroes triumph in their Glories past; And Lovers burn with unabating Fires. Ev'n Thought, the Parent of Distress or Joy, Is tun'd to Comfort, and drinks in Delight. Musick?—oh, sweet as Orpheus' Harp new strung With the fair Tresses of the Maid he lov'd! Here I'll recline, and feast on circling Pleasures. Enter Circe. But see! the Goddess of the Place approaches; Adorn'd with Youth, and rich in Beauty's Graces. Circe. My Spells are pros'prous:—Soft Desires have smooth'd His manly Brow, and Languishment his Eyes. [Aside. Do I not break upon your better Thoughts, Employ'd, perhaps, on some great Theme of Glory? If so, reprove me for the bad Intrusion, And send me from you, like a chidden Child, To weep my Fault in Silence. Orest. Think not, fair one, That I'm so savage, uninform'd of Soul, So blind, or quite insensible of Heart, As not to prize the Influence of your Charms Beyond all Objects idle Thought can furnish. What gross Barbarian was there e'er so rude, As saw the Sun, and worshipp'd not his Ray? Such Lustre yours, so fierce your sacred Beams, That my rapt Sense owns you a Thing divine, Feels all your Fires, and wonders at your Brightness. Circe. This Flatt'ry would displease from common Tongues; Tho', I confess, it sooths my Heart from yours: 'Tis Beauty's Pride to be the brave Man's Praise. But am I not to fear, the Hero's Strain Prevails too strongly to descend to Love? What Hope, the Lute should drown the Trumpet's Voice? Or Sighs, and amorous Whispers, pierce an Ear Tun'd to the Clank of Arms, and Shouts of Conquest? Orest. 'Tis true, the Soldier deals in rude Alarms, And Honour makes us brook the boistrous Trade, When Fame is the Pursuit. But know, fair Creature, Ambition kindles from the Paphian Fires; Extent of Sway, and Rivalship of Pow'r, Are not the Motives ever of our Broils: Love often buckles on the stubborn Mail: In Beauty's Cause we draw the Sword of War; And tempt the Chances of the dang'rous Field, To gain the rich, contended, Prize of Love. Circe. Yet might it much abate our Triumph, should you Esteem the Struggle dearer than the Prize: As vig'rous Hunters, that pursue the Stag, Doat on the sprightly Chase, yet slight its Purchase. Perhaps, should some o'er-fond, consenting Woman (Who could not boast herself the Spoil of Arms,) Begin th'Address of Love, and court your Kindness; Such Yielding might defeat her wish'd Pretensions, And make you view her with a cheap Regard. Orest. Not if the Fair One brought your Stock of Charms, And came a wooing with those Dove-like Eyes. Secure against Repulse, you're form'd to conquer, And bow the Heart yet unsubdued to Fondness. Circe. How happy were it for our credulous Sex, Had we that rare divining Spirit in Aid, To know true Faith from Vows of common Breath! But, lur'd at once by your professing Tongues, We rush into the gilded Snare of Falshood, And meet our Ruin in the gay Delusion. Orest. Propose what Oath your doubting Heart best likes, And hear me seal the lasting Bond of Love. Circe. You shall not swear; I'll rather be the Woman, Be self-deceiv'd, than wrong you with Distrust. But can you be content with tranquil Joys, With calm Delight, and still renewing Sweetness? Can you for these forsake the Hero's Toils, The busy War, and grow estrang'd to Glory? Orest. Like one, long harass'd with some Dream of Tumult, I wish to shake the cumbrous Frenzy off; Start from Dismay, and fly to Love for Shelter. Circe. Make me but Agent for that healing God, Invention shall be rack'd to work thy Peace. Come, prove our Skill: Pleasures attend my Call, And smiling Sports shall lull thy Cares to Softness. [Circe and Orestes seat themselves on a Bank. Singers enter, and, ranging themselves down each-side the Stage, sing the following Song to a Minuet. Love, spread all thy sweet Treasures, Thy own Triumphs to crown; Youth, Mirth, and smiling Pleasures Are Slaves to thy glad Throne. Glory is but a Bubble, Lost ev'n while we pursue; 'Tis all Tumult and Trouble, Flattering only to View. But once Beauty possessing, Joy rowls circling on Joy: Transports, past all expressing, Which, still tasted, ne'er cloy. Give, Love, give me to languish; Thy dear Shafts I invite; When most feeling thy Anguish, Then most feel we Delight. [Dancers enter, and perform in variety of Characters: The Dances concluding with the Minuet, repeated in Chorus, as they go off. [Orestes and Circe rise, and come forward. Orest. Thou art, indeed, a Mistress in Delights. Soft Languishment thrills sudden thro' my Veins, And I am sworn the Votary to thy Beauties. But, oh! the gaudy, prying, tell-tale Sun Glares o'er our Heads, and mocks our Protestations. Love wants not such a Witness of his Rites. Circe. Alas! I fear; and tremble at my Wishes.— Orest. Call up Desire, and he shall chase that Phantom. Come, let's elude th'inquiring Eye of Day, Steal to the Covert of yon friendly Bow'r, Where Gloom and Silence shall record our Vows; And crimson Blushes only gild its Shade. Pleasures and Ecstasies, our Handmaids there, Shall spread the Nuptial Couch; and Zephirs wait, Like Mutes, to fan us when we burn with Transport. [As they are retiring, a Clap of Thunder is heard; and Orestes stops, and lets go Circe's Hand. Orest. Ha! Do I wake?—Gods, speak again in Thunder! Dart your Oak-cleaving Bolts, ye dreadful Pow'rs, And blast this impious disobedient Slave, That durst grow careless of your great Command. I know you now.— [To Circe. Circe. Oh, do not look so stern. Orest. Why, are you not that sly deluding Fiend, Who trade in Incantations, Charms, and Philtres? Deprive our nobler Faculties of Reason, And train us, by a Shew of varnish'd Beauty, To do such Deeds, as force the Heav'ns to blush, And make the modest Moon mask her in Clouds? O, for a Sword! that I might right the Gods, And stop the Progress of thy future Mischiefs. Enter an Attendant to Circe hastily. Attend. O sacred Queen! some envious Pow'r is busy; And works to frustrate thy once-potent Charms. Enter Thoas and Guards. Circe. Is there a Pow'r, has strength to break my Spells? O Negligence of Art! The Fault's my own. Thoas. Seize on her Minion:—Bear him to the Temple: Away: and charge our Priests, they guard him well. [The Guards bear off Orestes. Ungrateful Woman! Am I thus repaid? Did I for this protect thee from the Rage Of Subjects justly stir'd? For this, brave Heav'n? And court the Dangers of thy wanton Bed, To taste the Fortune of Sarmatia's King, (Poor unsuspecting Prince!) thy night-drawn Dagger? But I'll begin to make my Vengeance bitter; And, in thy Lover, stab thy Heart with Vengeance. [Exit Thoas with Guards. Circe. Forbid it, Love! Am I not Circe still? And Daughter of the Sun? Insulting Man! I'll weave new Spells, shall baffle yet thy Threats. O triple Hecat! Lend thy boasted Pow'rs; Those Pow'rs, that made Medea strong in Vengeance. And, oh! If e'er Endymion touch'd thy Breast, Aid a lost Queen, whom both those Passions move; The Rage of Vengeance, and the Rage of Love. [Exit Circe. The End of the Third ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. SCENE, A Vault in the Temple. Enter Hermione and Iphigenia. Hermione. Sure, the blest Gods, by thy Discov'ry wrought, Dear Iphigenia, point out high Events Purpos'd in Fate, and mark the rip'ning Blessings.— You're not to learn by what Command I came, And know the Motives of my willing Voyage. What more induc'd, for Truth becomes our Sex, Was to decline a Tyrant-Lover's Suit; The fierce Achilles' Son, the haughty Pyrrhus; Who, pluming on my Father's free Consent, Join'd to his Services in Troy subdued, Sollicits not my Love; but, rudely boist'rous, Demands me as I were the Prize of Arms, And came a Captive to his forc'd Embrace. Iphig. Does he not know, your Hand and Faith are giv'n To young Orestes, my Imperial Brother? Does he not fear, the gallant Youth, return'd, Shall ask strict Justice for his Bed usurp'd; And dearly punish the intended Rape? Herm. Alas! Fear dwells not in Pelides' Race; Rapine, and War, and Violence, and Rage, Are the tumultuous Guests that haunt his Bosom. Then,—how should poor Orestes find Revenge, Who to himself is lost? his noble Sense Wild and untun'd; his Reason quite dislodg'd; And ev'ry tranquil Faculty of Soul The Prey to Frenzy, and imagin'd Horrors? There, there, Hermione is again undone:— His Fever, spreading like th'infectious Plague, Burns thro' my Veins, and drives me into Madness. Iphig. Fear not, dear Maid, but when this Slumber leaves him, The Rage of his Distemper will be quench'd. Thus ever, when the Fit of sudden Frenzy With horrid Forms has harass'd his hurt Mind, Spent with the Toil and Agonies of Thought, His languid Limbs sink down into Repose; And wounded Nature's heal'd by that sweet Balm. Herm. Perchance, he will not know me. Iphig. Do not doubt, But your good Beauties, like the sov'reign Sun, Shall call each scatter'd Ray of straggling Sense Back to its Sphere; pour Day upon his Soul; And drive those ugly Phantoms of Despair, That hang, and brood, o'er his benighted Mind. Now, all his Senses, late so wildly tost, Are lull'd to Rest; sweet as those Infants' Slumbers, When in their Dreams, as fonder Mothers think, They see Elysium dawn, and smile with Transport. Herm. You saving Gods! If we are worth your Care, Let all the medicinal Pow'rs of Sleep Be doubled in his Cure!—Ye Spirits of Health, Breathe Restauration on its honied Dews; Chase ev'ry Image of fantastick Horror; And peaceful Visions crown the soft Oppression! Iphig. Fear not, dear Princess; but to my Apartment Retire awhile:—Our gen'ral Safety calls me To high Concerns: Ere yet the circling Hour Strikes on the Bell of Night, I'll seek you there; And wait to lead you to your lov'd Orestes. [Leads Hermione to the Scene, and returns. Now Fate be busy! Prosper me, ye Gods, And aid the glorious Enterprize of Virtue! [Exit Iphigenia at the opposite Side. SCENE II. Circe's Magical Cave. Enter Chief Magician. Ch. Mag. 'Tis now the very Noon of silent Night, When Nature's duller Sons are steep'd in Rest; And only Murth'rers and Magicians wake. Wolves cease to howl; and the shrill-yelping Cur No longer bays the Moon. The hoarse Wind sleeps; The lazy slacken'd Surge scarce beats its Shore: And the moist Element above is hush. This solemn Hour demands our covert Rites; While shiv'ring Ghosts steal from the recent Shrowd, And glide disquiet, to their late-lov'd Homes: While Demons frolick; and the Satyr's Tread Makes bare the Ringlets in the flow'ry Field. But soft! the Partners of my Toils return. Enter several other Magicians. Say, is your Task perform'd at full? Caught you the Lamb of fable Wool? Chose you the dank unwholesom Pit, In barren Earth, by Thunder split; In some dark Vale, which, all the Year, Nor Show'rs bedew, nor Sun-beams chear? And thither backward o'er the Heath Drew you the Victim to her Death? Mag. The Trench was barren; Victim black; And o'er the Heath we drew her back. Ch. Mag. Did you the streaming Honey pour, Made thin with Milk, to mix the Gore? And when the Pit receiv'd the Flood, With blighted Slips of Cypress Wood Light you the Pile, and o'er its Flame Thrice call'd on Hecat's awful Name? Mag. All, as your Will requires, is done; What yet remains the Charm to crown? Ch. Mag. Instant the Sprigs of Hemlock cull, Dipt in the cold and mantled Pool, And with our Spell, and baneful Hymn, Made rank, as those on Lethe's Brim: Around the steaming Venom throw; And with it deadly Night-shade strew. Then wake those Sounds, that fright the Snake; And split her in the lonely Brake: Which pierce the Deep, and call up Sprights That revel in our Midnight Rites. [Harsh Musick. INCANTATION, Sung by three Magicians. Awfull Hecat! Come away; To thy triple Name and Sway Thrice we weave the potent Spell: Our Magic Verse Has Pow'r to pierce Air, and Earth, and deeper Hell. Whether on Earth you secret glide, Or on the driving Tempest ride; Whether the watry War you wage, Or point the slanting Lightning's Rage: Triple Hecat! Come away; Charms, that thy self subdue, obey. Ch. Mag. Enough:—dread Hecat comes; the Schriech-owl's Voice Pierc'd shrill my Ear: the silent Bat has flown Across our Cavern; and the drowsy Humm Of swarming Beetles trumpets her Approach. Hecat rises. Hec. Say, Slaves, on what important Theme, By Victim slain, and grateful Steam, Am I thus sudden hither drawn? What Mischiefs must prevent the Dawn? What Deaths by Land, at Sea what Wrecks, Are wish'd this Under-globe to vex? Pronounce some dear Distress of Price, Pleasing beyond your Sacrifice: Some Havock, worthy well our Trade, Your Thirst for Ill, and Hecate's Aid. Ch. Mag. Nor Death, nor Havock, now employs our Charms; Tho', haply, both may follow.—Mighty Regent! The Daughter of the Sun, Imperial Circe, Bow'd with Love's Anguish, gives this hasty Summons. Ev'n now she waits our finish'd Rites, to know What Issue's writ in Fate; what saving Arts Remain to snatch the darling Youth from Death. Hec. Base Triflers! Do you thus fulfill Your sworn Obedience to my Will? My Presence claims momentous Things, Ruin of Lands, and Death of Kings: To scatter the red Plague i'th' Air, And blast the Promise of the Year. And am I call'd from far to save A wanton Minion from the Grave? Tell her, I do your Spells withstand; And will not deal in her Command. Ch. Mag. Alas! You know her Gifts: Has she not Pow'r With sudden Clouds t'obscure the sacred Day? Rowl Waters backward, and untie the Wind? From her pale Sphere call down the frighted Moon? And task the Demons both of middle Air, And Hell's black Deeps, to execute her Purpose? Hec. She should have practis'd Deeds of Hate: To love, befits a vulgar Fate. The thwarting Gods oppose her Flame, Dooming Events we must not name. She comes:—Take heed, your Answers all Be doubtful, and equivocal. If farther she require to know, The rest we will in Vision shew; With mystick Meaning circled round, And dark, and intricate t'expound. [Hecat descends. Enter Circe. Cir. My lab'ring Bosom swells with strong Impatience; Dreadful Uncertainty, what Racks of Soul Attend thy Intervals!—Ye Snails in Art, Most prompt of Promise, Drones to execute! What say th'Infernal Pow'rs?—Pronounce, and ease me. Ch. Mag. When next the Prince from Bonds is freed, Unless your Hands assist the Deed, He breaks for ever from your Arms: Few Hours are granted to your Charms. You must his Chains release this Night, Or, ere the Dawn, he takes his Flight. Circe. Ha! takes his Flight?—that Sentence chills my Blood: A dreadful Fate is menac'd in this Warning. —'Tis Death, or I, alone can set him free. And, if my Efforts fail, the Tyrant's Steel Must drink his Blood,—and so he takes his Flight.— Prevent it, Gods!—Say, is not this denounc'd? Explain the Horrors of your dark Prediction. Ch. Mag. The Pow'rs, reluctant to your Pray'r, Permit not farther to declare. Circe. Reluctant! Force the stern and sullen Demons; Do it and claim our richest Grace to friend you: Refuse, and all the Plagues, my baleful Arts Have Pow'r t'inflict, shall make your Lives accurst. Ch. Mag. What more your doubting Heart would know, Forbid to us in Words to shew, Fantastick Forms shall instant rise, In Vision shadowing to your Eyes. [The Priest waves his Wand, and at the Mouth of the Cave appear, and cross over, four Priests of Diana, the Statue of the Goddess born on the Pedestal; Grecians with their Swords drawn, following it; Iphigenia, led by Pylades; Orestes leading Hermione, follow'd by Hermes.] Circe. The Statued Goddess born in solemn Pomp, Guarded, as 'twere the Spoil of hostile Bands? The Priestess too, led by the Grecian's Friend, Discharg'd of Bonds, and smiling in his Fate?— And there the lovely Prince—but ha! what Maid Of Grecian Garb, in Pride of blooming Youth, Graces his Hand, and seems to charm his Soul? He sees me now—Confusion! how he frowns, And turns his Eye as from an hated Object!— Then Hermes—wherefore follows he, and seems To guide the Train committed to his Charge? What mean the riddling Pow'rs? Alas! I fear. —'Tis Hermes' Office to conduct the Dead. But why the Priestess? Is she too to die? There the dark Pageantry confounds my Sense; And warns me how I trust its mystic Purport. Back to the Temple then—There all my Doubts Shall stand resolv'd: Employ the fav'ring Night; Make strong thy Arts to save the darling Youth, Or perish with him at the fatal Altar. [Exeunt Circe, and Magicians severally. SCENE III. Vault of the Temple. Orestes discover'd seated on a Couch. Enter Iphigenia, and Hermione. Iphig. See, where with Eyes down-cast, as wrapt in Thought, Calm and at Ease, the much lov'd Youth reclines. Herm. Heav'n shield, this Gloom portend not black Despair! Then we are lost— Iphig. Think better of the Gods, Who shape all Causes to their purpos'd End. Approach his Couch: Your Presence shall revive, And charm each Sense with unexpected Pleasure. Something of Moment yet remains undone, T'ensure our Safety: that dispatch'd, I'll speed, To share your Joys. [Exit Iphigenia. Orest. [Rising.] Was she not an Adult'ress? 'Tis true, I kill'd her: Pardon that, ye Gods! But she did first with sacrilegious Hand Invade her Royal Husband's sacred Life. Herm. Alas! he raves, he raves: the fatal Cause Dwells on his Mind, and urges fresh Distraction. Orest. See, there she stands; the vengeful injur'd Spectre; And not to be appeas'd with all my Torments. The silent, stern Reproaches of her Eye Wound me beyond a thousand Scorpions' Stings. Herm. Where are the Comforts fled, that flatt'ring Hope, My foolish fond Desires, had drawn to cheat me? [Weeps. Orest. Ha! Sure, she weeps.—Can she at length forgive? Her Eyes are mild and gentle; and her Voice Soft as the Close of distant, dying, Musick. What mean the Pow'rs?—Are yet my Senses safe? Or all bewilder'd in a gay Delusion? I cannot be deceiv'd: her Form, her Looks, The blended Grace of Majesty and Sweetness, Steal in, and whisper to my ravish'd Soul, It is, it must be, my Hermione. Herm. If 'tis your Joy to entertain the Thought, I am indeed Hermione, and yours. Orest. O Transport more than crouding Words can utter! [Embracing her. Than Action speak, or struggling Life support! What God, indulgent to Orestes' Woes, Could send thee to restore his Mind to Peace, To long-lost Peace?—Did thy relenting Sire At length consent? Or mighty Love persuade, Thy matchless Love, to tempt th'advent'rous Voyage? Herm. Love, only Love: the Fears thy Absence gave Inspir'd, and made me bold, to share thy Dangers. Orest. Transcendent Goodness! O thou all Perfection! I will not tax Heav'n's Wrath, but think my Suff'rings O'erpaid with Weight—O my Hermione, I have a thousand Questions yet to ask, Which, as thou would'st resolve, impatient Fondness With fresh Enquiries still shall break thy Tale; And Kisses interrupt the lov'd Narration: So shall the varied History renew; And, lost in sweet Confusion of Delight, Be ever to begin, and never finish. Herm. Nor when Occasion sorts, and better Hours, Shall I regret the oft-repeated Tale, Or come reluctant to repay thy Fondness. Orest. Wrong not thy self to talk of better Hours; Occasion ever smiles, when thou art present; And Time waits pleas'd, subservient to thy Beauties. By Heav'n, I feel so absolute a Joy To hold thee thus; such full Content of Soul; Fate cannot disappoint the mighty Comfort. Enter Pylades. Come to my Arms, my best-lov'd Pylades; Close to my Heart, that beats and bounds with Transport. See here, and wonder how the Gods have blest me. [Shews Hermione. Pylad. Already have I triumph'd in that Joy. Welcome, bright Maid!—I've too a Tale of Comfort, That warms my Veins, and sooths each vital Part. The Gods show'r down Profusion of Delight: The lovely Priestess— Orest. What of that kind Maid? Pylad. Stands now confest thy Sister— Orest. 'Tis too much; These sudden Whirls of Fate o'erpow'r my Mind. My Sister, say'st thou? Pylad. She, th'imperial Charmer, Whom Phœbus promis'd here, your Iphigenia, Who waits to guide you to your Native Throne; Your Pilot to Renown, to Joy, and Empire. Orest. How can her Weakness stem our rugged Fate? Pylad. Thro' her shall we elude the Tyrant's Rage; Thro' her the statued Goddess climbs our Decks; Thro' her th'attendant Priests assist our Flight; And now, while Darkness aids the secret Purpose, She stands prepared to lead you forth to Safety. This was pronounc'd in Iphigenia found; This, Iphigenia found demands t'accomplish. Orest. You equal Gods, who work these high Events, Let not the Hand of Chance come in to cross This Birth of Joy.—My best Hermione! This is a blessed Hour—I see Content [To Pylades.] Sit on thy Brow, like that of new-crown'd Kings, Pleas'd with the Tribute of their Peoples Smiles. She's thine, my Friend; that glorious fav'ring Sun, Which gives Hermione to my longing Arms, Shall gild your Nuptials too.— Pylad. These rushing Joys Must yet be stifled, lest they grow too loud, And so prevent themselves: for here we stand Circled with Dread, and rounded in with Danger. Herm. Alas! what Noise? Did not the Temple Gates Creak on their brazen Hinge? Orest. Repress thy Fears: 'Twas but the Whistling of the nightly Breeze, That murmurs hollow thro' these winding Vaults. Enter Iphigenia. Pylad. But see, the lovely Maid—say, is all well? Iphig. Ev'n to our Wish. High on the Grecian Deck, Incircled with our venerable Band, Great Dian's hallow'd Statue safe is lodg'd. The Ship is in her Trim; the Sailers yare To weigh her Anchors; and the fav'ring Wind Blows fresh, and ruffles in the outspread Sails. Th'impatient Warriors wait in still Array, And, fearful to disturb the Ear of Night, Ask in low Whispers for their Prince Orestes. Orest. My Sister!—O what Words can Rapture furnish To gratulate this Joy? [Embraces her. Iphig. Of that hereafter. The Time invites; and ev'ry Moment's Pause Is big with Danger—See, the Lamps burn bright, To guide us thro' the subterranean Vault, That opens to the Shore. Pylad. Lead on, my Friend. Orest. Come, dearest Maids, be you our Stars of Hope, To guide our Vessel thro' the darksom Seas. And, awful Goddess, thou, whose sacred Image Attends us by thy Brother's great Command, Protect us for these pious Virgins sake. And, friendly Jove, in whose Imperial Hand The Care of Empire rests, look down and save The poor Remains of Agamemnon's House. Pylad. And Heav'nly Juno! Thou that still hast stood The Bulwark and Defence of lab'ring Greece! O grant, this Promise of my Joys be crown'd In a Friend rescued, and a Mistress found. [Exeunt. The End of the Fourth ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. SCENE, An Apartment in the Palace. Thoas discover'd at a Table. Tapers burning. Thoas. The Season asks Repose; but watchful Cares Barr Slumber from my Eyes.—What Pangs are these, That rankle in my Breast? Are they of Love, Or Jealousy for Passion ill-repaid? Which e'er the Source, Enjoyment and Revenge Must be the Cure:—but, first, to be reveng'd.— The am'rous Queen burns for our destin'd Victim; And may again with Magick Wiles attempt To snatch him from the Shrine.—Prevent that Fear: Cut off its Object, and the Passion dies.— Why should I hazard, what may be ensur'd? My Fate cries out, This Interval is mine: And, either way, our Goddess Rites are paid; Whether the solemn sacrificing Steel, Or my more secret Dagger, drink his Blood. —It shall be so.—While Night and Silence reign, I'll steal, and execute my own Revenge. Grecian, I come: Thy Genius must be strong, And watchful, if he ward this Blow of Justice. [Exit Thoas. [[SCENE II.]] SCENE changes to the Vault of the Temple. Enter Circe. Cir. What inward Torments tear that doting Wretch, Who still burns on, yet finds her Flame unanswer'd! O Love! unequal God! at whose dread Shrine We breathe the Off'rings of our faithful Hearts With pure Devotion; be not ever deaf, And unauspicious to thy Suppliant's Pray'rs. If thou would'st stand a Deity revered In Circe's Soul, yet bow this stubborn Youth; And make him feel the Influence of thy Sway.— Once more I'll prove him.—Why, the Guard remov'd, And the wide Dome still as the Cave of Sleep? What mean this Solitude, and careless Watch? But Solitude and Stillness aid my Purpose. [Goes in, as to Orestes's Cell. Enter Thoas. Thoas. The Temple-Lamps blaze thro' the vaulted Isles; Keep back your Tapers, and presume no farther; But, there, at distance wait our coming forth.— All's hush, and still:—The Superstitious Train Of droning Priests, that think the Goddess' Wrath Is cancell'd by her Statue duly cleans'd, On the Sea-shore extend their formal Rites, And are not yet return'd.—Then, to thy Work. The Cell stands open:—You dread Spirits, that wait Unseen, yet ready at stern Murther's Call, Come, and make strong my Arm with righteous Vengeance. [As he is going in, Enter Circe. Death to my Hopes, the Queen!—This covert Visit, Contriv'd at this dead Hour, needs no expounding. Licentious Woman!—Does the Captive Greek Yet listen to the Lure, yet stoop to Love? Circe. Dissembling Tyrant! am I thus insulted? Where is the Captive? Thoas. These are new Refinements, New Arts, to save your Cheek the conscious Blush. You have not seen him then? Circe. Provoking Man! Who know'st thy mean Suspicions have withdrawn him Safe from my View, and triumph'st in th'Exploit! Thoas. Make me the Messenger of your Commands; To tell this haughty Slave, a sighing Queen Waits to be heard;—for now I go to seek him. Circe. Ha!— [Shewing a Dagger. Thoas. Start you?—Can Sarmatia's banish'd Queen, Whose daring Hand was traded young in Blood, Shrink back with Horror at a night-drawn Dagger? Circe. Well may I shrink with Horror, to behold The Sanctity of Empire thus prophan'd; To see thee thus, with an unsceptred Hand, Stalk like the mortal Genius of Revenge, The stealthy Minister of lurking Death, And Mischiefs, that abhor the Eye of Day. Thoas. Say rather, thou didst start with conscious Dread, While Mem'ry, faithful to record foul Deeds, Presented this a Dagger to thy Mind; Reflecting on thee thine own murth'ring Image; When, at dead Night, thou didst, thus badly arm'd, Steal on thy sleeping Lord's unguarded Hour, And plunge the Weapon in his kingly Breast. Circe. Mean, and ill-judging Wretch! It suits thy Tongue T'adopt the Slanders of licentious Crouds; And make their envious Calumnies thine own. Had the Sarmatian been like thee, a base Unmeritable Man, his Want of Worth Had made me glory in that Stroke of Justice; His People's Praise had crown'd the great Atchievement; Had sanctified the horrid Name of Murther, And call'd his Death a publick Sacrifice. Thoas. Oh, unexampled Outrage! Yet, I thank thee; I thank thee, that thou tak'st this wondr'ous Pains To wake me from the Lethargy of Dotage. I see thee now stript of that Glare of Charms, In which my too uncautious Love had deck'd thee. Thy Siren's Face assumes the Gorgon's Fierceness: And that alluring Voice, which late I thought Sweet as the Tune of Morn-saluting Lark, Sounds harsh, and fatal as the Mandrake's Groan. Circe. This fierce Intemperance, that strives to wear The Form of Hate, is but th'ungovern'd Rage Of a fond Heart o'er-charg'd with jealous Transports: I know my Pow'r, and triumph in the Knowledge. Barz. [within.] Where is the King? Attend. He will not be disturb'd. Barz. My Business cries aloud for instant Audience, And warrants my Approach. Enter Barzanes, with his Sword drawn. Thoas. Presumptious Slave! Whence this wild Haste, and why thy Weapon drawn? Barz. Your Scythians, mighty Sir, drawn by Command To guard your Shores against the Grecian Vessels, Astonish'd at Events, all stand aghast, And motionless as Things devoid of Soul. Your Presence only can recal their Spirits, Or All is lost. Thoas. Astonisht at Events! What mean the feeble superstitious Cowards? Barz. Too sure, the subtle Priests have given these Fears. They, and the Priestess, all abett the Foe; Have borne our Statue, and your Captives, off; And bought their Welcome to the Grecians' Side. Circe. The Captive 'scap'd! O my distracted Soul! For this has Circe strain'd her magick Arts, Rack'd ev'ry Spell, and task'd each aiding Pow'r? Thoas. The Priestess, said'st thou? Oh, the treach'rous Sex! What! circumvented by a peevish Girl! Proclaim it round our Bands, the gallant Chief, That brings her back, shall taste our richest Favour. Barz. The wondr'ing Croud swarm round her on the Beach, And, aw'd with Rev'rence of her Form and Office, Drink in her Words, gaze on the Grecian Pair, Neglectful of their Charge, and dead to Arms. Circe. Yet, Thoas, take me Partner in Revenge: Draw out your Strengths, man ev'ry Ship of Battle, And Circe shall outdo th'united War. Thoas. Perfidious Woman, no: The Gods are angry That I have given thee Refuge, and begin To visit me with Plagues for that Presumption.— I'll trust no longer to thy hellish Arts, But fall, or prosper, in my single Virtue. [Exeunt Thoas and Barzanes. Circe. Go, and thy own Perverseness work thy Ruin! But the lov'd Prince,—th'Infernal Gods pronounc'd, Unless I loos'd his Bonds, should take his Flight.— But shall it be? Love cannot brook the Thought, Nor Life support such fatal Disappointment. Ye Pow'rs, that still have waited on my Charms, Ere yet he climbs the Bark, make void his Purpose: Or sink th'Ungrateful in the whelming Wave. —Why do I pause? Prevention must have Wings: Earth, Sea, and Air obey my great Command; And all their Terrors shall assist my Vengeance. [Exit Circe. [[SCENE III.]] SCENE changes to a Wood. An Alarm. Enter Thoas attended. Thoas. Heav'ns! with what Rage these daring Greeks rush on! Aw'd at their Force, our dastard Scythians fly, Like tim'rous Doves before the stooping Eagle. Hence to the Citadel: Command, they send Fresh Succours down, and join us at the Port. [Exeunt. Enter Hermione. Herm. How has the Darkness of the Night undone me! How has the rushing Torrent of the War Snatch'd from my Side the fierce, impetuous Prince! If Danger meets him in the darksome Fray, What then avails it that the Scythians fly? Seek him I must thro' all the Paths of Death: The dreadful Clash of Arms on ev'ry Side Affrights my Ear: Heav'n guard me from the Foe! Whichever Way I bend, the Hazard's equal. [As she is going, Enter Circe. Circe. Ha! Who art thou, that dar'st at this wild Hour, Spight of thy feeble Sex, alone, unguarded, Mix in the War, and tread the Rounds of Danger? Herm. What shall I say, or how avoid her Fury? Circe. Now, by the Pangs that swell my jealous Heart, 'Tis she, the blooming Greek, whose hated Form Th'infernal Pow'rs so late in Vision shew'd me.— Disast'rous Maid, abandon'd by the Fates, Curse that ungovern'd Frenzy brought thee hither, To vie with Circe in unequal Charms; And, knowing now thy Rival, know thy Danger. Herm. How Resolution labours in my Breast, To get above my Fears!— Circe. Thou can'st not palliate Thy Arrogance of Love, therefore be dumb: But if thou wilt atone for this bold Crime, Swear by thy Country's Gods, whom most thou fear'st, To quit all Int'rest in Orestes' Heart, And, tho' he seek thy Bed, to shun his Arms. Herm. Forbid it, Heav'n!— Circe. Nay, do not dally with me: My Moments are too precious now for trifling: Swear, or this Poniard drinks thy hated Blood. Herm. Inhuman Murth'ress! sate thy barb'rous Rage. I feel new Vigour shoot thro' ev'ry Vein; And Death, in all the ugliest Shapes of Torture, Could not now force me to abjure my Love. No, I defy thy Threats. Circe. Die then, fond Wretch. Herm. Save me, ye virtuous Gods! Kind Mercy, save me!— [As Circe pursues her with a Dagger, Enter Orestes and his Party. Orest. What Voice of shrill Distress assail'd my Ear? Ha! My Hermione! Do I once more hold thee? [Embracing. Herm. Thanks to the Gods—O save me from her Fury. Orest. Sorc'ress, avaunt! Pernicious, sly Seducer! How dar'st thou, now the Sword of War is drawn, Encounter thus my Rage? Circe. What means my Love? My watchful Art is busy in thy Care. Time is our own: Now, whilst the Scythian Tyrant, Thoughtless of high Events that swell my Soul, Plies the dull Task of Arms, my winged Carr Safe, and untrac'd, thro' Fields of Air shall bear us To vernal Groves, and Bow'rs of blooming Pleasure. Why art thou mute? [Approaching him. Orest. Avaunt, once more I warn thee: And, ere thy magic Wiles, thy plotted Mischiefs Rise fresh to Mem'ry, fly: nor tempt my Soul To stain a Soldier's Blade with female Slaughter. Circe. Vain Braggart! I despise thy empty Rage. Too plain I see the Cause of thy Neglect, Thy shameful Perfidy, and alter'd Vows; Licentious, perjur'd Man!—Thou can'st not hurt me; I'm charm'd in Art above thy feeble Fury; Art, that shall exercise itself in Vengeance On thee, on her, thy Friend, and boasted Sister. [Exit Circe. Orest. Shame to thy Sex, and Virtue! Frontless Woman!— But well she warns me: In that fatal Moment When thou wert sever'd from me, wild with Fears, I ran and left my Sister and my Friend, Who now may need our Aid. Herm. Let's seek them out: Where most the sprightly Din of Arms is heard, There shall the noble Pylades be found, Lab'ring for Love, for Friendship, and for Glory. Orest. But oh! too much art Thou expos'd to Danger. Let me secure Thee from these dreadful Hazards, Then with intrepid Heart, steel'd in thy Safety, With rival Force I'll rush into the War; And emulate my noble Friend's Renown. Herm. No, Thou and only Thou shalt be my Shield, Firm by thy Side, I'll tempt the rough Encounter, And share the Chance of ev'ry singing Dart. Enter Grecian Captain. Capt. O fatal Chance of Arms! Your gallant Friend, And Sister, by the Scythian Force o'er-powr'd, Are Both made Captives to the haughty Tyrant. Orest. Too fatally the Sorc'ress then prevails: My Sister and my Friend in shameful Bonds! Injurious Fate, where will thy Malice end? Herm. This is no Time for Plaints: Resume the Hero: Fly, instant, to redeem our Captive Friends. My Spartan Bands, till now reserv'd for Aid, Fresh for the Field, wait but the Signal giv'n, To pour Destruction on these abject Scythians. Each Moment's now an Age.— Orest. Heroic Maid! O my fair Warrior, come, beneath thy Banners, With thy auspicious Aid, I'll wage this War; And Vict'ry must succeed, where thou direct'st it. [Exeunt. [[SCENE IV.]] SCENE changes to an open Wood. Enter Thoas, and his Party; with Pylades and Iphigenia Prisoners. Thoas. The Heav'n's are just:—Look not in vain for Rescue, Thou fugitive Traitress!—Could not thy Defender, That boist'rous Youth, protect thee from our Force, And hop'st thou yet, fond Girl, to 'scape my Hands? Iphig. I have no Hope: Death is the utmost Bound Of all my Wishes:—Use a Conqu'ror's Right; Indulge thy Tyrant Rage, and kill me here. Thoas. Be sure, thou hast not long to wish for Death, In Retribution to my injur'd Throne. Survey the fatal Havock of thy Treasons, My Subjects slain, our hallow'd Altar rob'd; Then ask thy conscious Soul what Dues of Vengeance Thy double Crime demands. Pylad. Th'imputed Crime In her was justified by Nature's Laws, By righteous Nature; and her Treason, Virtue. If Thou art wrong'd, shew Justice in thy Vengeance; 'Twas I provok'd those Wrongs. On Me thy Subjects May wreak their Hate, and satisfy Resentment. But if Thou think to touch her sacred Life, The Pow'rs, that make such Innocence their Care, Shall show'r their fiercest Indignation down; And dearly punish the unhallow'd Daring. Thoas. Lies the Debate of Right and Wrong with Thee, Proud Youth, who art the Captive of our Arms? Dar'st thou in Bonds prescribe my Terms of Justice, And deem with Threats to give thy Conqu'ror Law? That boasted Innocence the Pow'rs should guard, Is, as thou see'st, giv'n up by their Displeasure: And the Decision of her Fate and thine Now rests in me, and waits as I determine. Pylad. Tyrant,— Iphig. O Prince, provoke not farther Rage: We must submit: and if the wrathful Gods Have doom'd it so, Death cannot give me Fear. Pylad. Think not, bright Maid, Darkness and poor Surprize Shall cast the Issue of thy better Fate: [Trumpets at a Distance. Hark, Tyrant, hark:—Our Grecian Trumpet sounds A nearer Blast, and breathes the sprightly Charge. Our scatter'd Greeks are rallied in the Field, My noble Friend is lab'ring for our Rescue, And Destiny obeys his prosp'rous Sword. They come. Thoas. Retire our Pris'ners: guard them well. Look out, and see what new Alarm is this. Enter Orestes and his Party. Orest. Tyrant, give back my Friends:—My gallant Foll'wers, There lies our Chase: Renown and Jove befriend us! [Orestes sets on Thoas, and drives him off. A Wheeling Fight seen thro' the Wood, in which Pylades and Iphigenia are rescued. After the Fight, [[SCENE V.]] SCENE changes to another Part of the Wood. Enter Orestes, Hermione, Pylades, Iphigenia, and Greeks. Pylad. My brave Deliv'rer! O what Thanks, what Praise, Can speak this glorious Rescue! Orest. Peace, my Friend: Fortune would chide us, should we lose these Moments. The Field is ours: Now haste we to our Ships, And, while the Goddess smiles, make sure our Flight. [Exeunt. Enter Thoas, Barzanes, and Scythians. Thoas. Curse on my own weak Arm, and weaker Scythians! And sink those treacherous Barks, that turn'd their Sterns, And left us to sustain th'unequal War! Shall I be baffled by such puny Force? Command our Vessels to the Harbour's Mouth; Hang Beacons out: drain all our Forts for Aid: My Kingdom on the Hazard:—Death, or Conquest! [Exeunt Thoas and Barzanes severally. [[SCENE VI.]] SCENE changes to the Port. Enter Circe, attended with Women. Circe. What sullen Gods yet disappoint my Charms? The Seas are calm, the Moon serenely shines, Help, Pow'rs of Hell, to blot the Face of Nature! Earth, from your hidden Gulfs pour Floods of Flame: Ye pent-up Winds, burst your confining Caves, And raise a Wall of Waters to the Skies! [A Ship appears here under Sail. Wake, ye hoarse Thunders, split their Keels of Oak! Ye sulph'rous Lightnings, burn their outspread Sails! Hear, Spirits of Mischief, hear my dreaded Voice: Let Uproar loose; bid the big Tempest roar: Tis well:—'This is a Pomp becoming Circe. [Thunder; a Shower of Fire. Ha! See, they drive before th'obedient Wind, And the lewd Sea spreads wide her liquid Bosom.— My Magic fails, and Hell grows deaf.—Despair, Thou Demon of the World, be present to me! And oh! thou Sun, once thought my boasted Sire, I here disclaim thy pure, eternal Essence: I would derive all from my mortal Mother; Be mortal all;—for Life's become my Curse. —Yet, let me not expire like common Wretches, Unmark'd and fading in ignoble Silence. Awake, Confusion, while I give this Blow. [Stabs herself. Let Nature feel it; let my dying Groans Ride on the Storm, and with Convulsions shake her! O that the loosen'd Globe would now dissolve, And Order sicken with one vast Destruction! Enter Thoas. Thoas. The Fates mock all the Efforts of my Arms. 'Tis plain, the Gods are factious on the Side Of Iphigenia and her princely Brother: Their Sufferings have been great: and oft 'tis found, There is a secret Merit in Distress, That at a Season reconciles the World; And draws Opinion to befriend the Cause. Ha! the Queen!— Weltring in Blood, and grov'ling on the Earth? Quick, seek out Aid. Circe. O Sir, all Aid is vain. I feel the courted Foe make keen Dispatch. Yet, ere I die, forgive a hapless Queen, Whom Love's resistless Passion has undone. A Woman's Hand atones a Woman's Crime. [Dies. Thoas. There fled her furious Spirit.—What Pity 'tis, The Virtues of the Mind match'd not her Form! 'Tis the Gods doing, who still make our Passions The Instruments to scourge our proper Ills. How safe, and virtuous to revere their Dictates! These Greeks, 'tis said, obey'd divine Command; And prosper in it—From these high Events I'll learn to think, howe'er Misfortunes wound Our inward Peace, and seeming Plagues surround; Upright of Soul, while We the Heav'ns obey, Blessings, tho' late, shall our worst Toils repay. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE; Written by HENRY FIELDING, Esq; Spoken by Mrs. YOUNGER. Of all the Plagues, with which a Poet's curst, This heavy Tax of Epilogue's the worst: For tho' his Muse be jaded in his Play, Still she must speak, tho' she has Nought to say. In vain the worn-out Goddess he invokes, No Husbands, grown quite weary of their Yokes, Are so put to't for Love,—as those for Jokes. To save himself, One would the Beaux condemn; And shews his Wit, by shewing none in them. Their Bodies, as their Minds, he ridicules; Nor will allow 'em that sure Claim of Fools, To be, at least, the Womens proper Tools. Another, more inclin'd to Love than Satire, Would dress his Wit up by undressing Nature. The Virgin, whom his Lines can fail to touch, Must either know too little, or too much. Virtue by Theory taught in five dull Acts is, The Epilogue reduces Vice to Practice. Tho', in his Play, the Greek or Roman Dame Shuns the least Hint of an indecent Flame; Tho', rather than submit to naughty Wooing, She laughs at Danger, and encounters Ruin; Wait till the Epilogue, she stands confest E'en One of Us,—her Virtue all a Jest: Laughs at her Lover, if he let her 'scape; And shews, she was too brave to fear a Rape. Where-e'er the Tragic Scene is laid, 'tis plain The Epilogue still lies—in Drury-Lane. But 'tis, alike, each Author's darling Care To recommend his Labours to the Fair. Our Author this attempts by various Strains, Love for soft Hearts,—and Musick for soft Brains. Ladies, be kind, and let his Plea stand good; Condemn not Both, because they're understood. Once in an Age, at least, your Smiles dispense To English Sounds, and Tragedy that's Sense. These are Variety to you, who come From the Italian Opera, and Tom Thumb. FINIS.</field>
