      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDY OF KING SAUL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">QuantÃ² rectius hoc, quam tristi LÃ¦dere Versu, Pantolabum Scurram, Nomentanumq; Nepotem? Hor. Satyr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epistle Dedicatory, TO THE Right Honourable the Countess of Burlington, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PREFACE. Tho' the Great Person that wrote this Excellent Tragedy, stands in need of no other Pen than His own, to defend Him or His Inimitable Composures, I could not think it Proper to be sent abroad, without some necessary Illustrations to set the Design, and the happy Accomplishment of it, in a True Light; that those who value nothing but what comes on Theatres may see their mistakes, and draw Conclusions for the future, quite contrary to those they have formerly been fond of. The Design of it, is (what should be the End of all Dramatical Entertainments) the Encouragement of Virtue, and Punishment of Vice; and the Character of Saul strugling with Misfortunes at the same time as He is under a Perfect Resignation to the Will of Him that sent 'em, will be of Admirable use to Men under the like Circumstances, while that of Jonathan, will be of everlasting Remembrance, to those that would study the Practice of True Friendship, or be instructed in Lessons of Obedience to Parents, and Fidelity to those that are under Engagements with 'em. In short, the Sacred Writ is not the least damag'd by that which must bear the Name of Prophane, since it comes not from an Inspir'd Hand, and Art may be said to have a Tryal of Skill with Nature, in order to shew which has the greatest Prevalency. How is Jonathan divided between his Duty to his Distress'd Father, and his Pity to his Persecuted Friend? What Anguish of Soul has he amidst his concern for Saul's Welfare, and his Affection for David, falsly suppos'd to be Saul's greatest Enemy, yet how does the Poet reconcile him to Himself, in the midst of the two extreams, and do him a Piece of Justice not to be exceeded in Poetry, or Parallel'd in any thing yet extant whether Ancient or Modern. David may be truly said in this Excellent Author's Lines, as well as His own, to speak like the Man after God's own Heart, and has more grateful Acknowledgments payd here to His high Deserts than some Modernists who have put their Words into His Mouth, and made him cease to be either King or Psalmist. The Amalakite has the Reward of his Demerits, and is Punish'd with Death for lifting up his Hand against the Lord's Anointed, a Crime that in our time is dismiss'd without Censure, nay, is even Approv'd of, and had in Reverence by those that frequent our Calves-Head Assemblies, and keep Feasts for that Royal Blood the Nation can never do enough Penance for. To conclude, the Noble Author, (for every one that knows a Deceas'd Man of Qualitie's way of writing, must guess at the Gentleman that Obliges the World with this,) has reach'd the Exactest Stile, and Sublimest Fancy, and kept within the Confines of Truth and Sense, at the same time as He has thought fit to soar upon the Wings of Rapture and Admiration; and tho' the Persons that have the Government of the Stage have Rejected this Heroick Poem, as being freighted with too much Vertue, and Morality, to gain 'em a full Audience, 'tis hop'd the Nobility and Gentry will neither Degenerate from their Ancestors, or themselves, by denying it their Acceptance and Encouragement. To give an Advantage, and adapt it in some Measure to the Air of the Times, the Reader is here and there Entertain'd with Poetical Interludes of Ghosts, Furies, &amp;c. which the Publisher has taken care should be set to Musick by the Best Hands, which may Recommend it to be Acted in Schools, and Universities, as a proper Entertainment for those that have Ingenious and Liberal Education, on Solemn Occasions. Which may be of extream Consequence to their future Instruction, and of great Use to their Conduct of Life, since every one may make an Estimate from hence of the Vicissitude of Humane Affairs, the Ambition and Fall of Tyranny, the Rise and Triumphs of Virtue, the Miraculous Preservation of Innocence, the Success of Fortitude, the Mutual Endearments of true Friendship, the Power and Constancy of Virtuous Love, the Downfal and Disappointments of great Men, the Poisonous and Hurtful Flattery of Sycophants, and the Reward of Treachery, which may be very Instrumental to a Regulation of Manners, and tend to the Advancement of Honesty and Honour, the two Pillars that are to support us in our Passage through this Vale of Life to that of Ãternity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE, spoken by King David. When Verse and Virtue both United Join, To form and bring about some great Design; We Praise with Justice what's with Justice wrought, And with Choice Thanks return each Chosen Thought. Such be my Task, and such my Present Care, Never till now well us'd in English Air, Never but wrong'd and injur'd by my Foes, Till on my side this Vengeful Author rose, That Preciously my Memory Embalms, And makes me full amends for Martyr'd Psalms. Sternhold be thou forgot with thy Offence, And Hopkins thou Assassin to my Sense, Musick succeeds your Inharmonious Songs, And Brittain does atone for Brittain's Wrongs, As David's Pleasures, David's Pains Requite, And makes him Sing a Poem he would write. As evr'y Line do's every Beauty trace, And Art Illustrates Natures shining Grace: Not that our Author gives us Painted Scenes, Or leans upon the Help of Fine Machines, He scorns such base Assistances of Wit, To Crowd a Gallery, or to fill a Pit, But moves your Mind neglectful of your sight, And stead of wronging does Religion right. As Scenes instructive as they'r chast and safe, Dismiss you back to learn, that come to laugh. And having every Height of Honour won, Teach you those Virtues Modern Stage; shun, While in Grimace their whole Instructions lye, And Songs and Dances please the Ear and Eye. While Elford's and Labee's high Movements take, And Margaretta's please for Fancies sake. Though Margaretta's Worth would justly shine, Were but her Songs, as is her Voice, Divine. [i. e. English'd by Mr. Henry Purcell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The EPILOGUE, spoken by Jonathan. Now, to apply the Doctrines to your Use, And Regulate an Age Prophane and Loose; In Saul, you've seen, how Tyrant Passion Reigns, And binds ev'n Lawless Monarchs with its Chains. How Kings that yield to its Imperious sway, Fall unsuccessful, as in this our Play, And from my Father's unrelenting Hate, You learn t'avoid his Temper with his Fate. In David's Glorious Character and mine, Two bright Examples of strict Friendship shine, Loyal the first though by his Prince Pursu'd, And Dutious to the King that seeks his Blood. Steadfast the last, and permanently true, Just to his Friend and to his Father too: Not that my Vertue shou'd prevent my Fall, I dy'd but justly since I sprung from Saul. In Michol is presented to the Life, A Pious Daughter and a Faithful Wife. Fearless of harms, while she from harms defends The Best of Husbands and the Best of Friends: And not a Character, but justly done, Instructs you what to seek, or what to shun. And must such goodly Precepts find no Grace, Amidst a Christian Land and Learned Race? Forbid it Brittain! but thy Sons should Rise, And Follow what we teach with longing Eyes: Observe our Dictates, and digest our Rules, Worthy the chiefest Cares of Courts and Schools We on our side the English Maxim plead, And tempt with Hopes of Gain to make you Read, A Bait that never wanted to succeed: And never must while Profit and Delight, Join to Persuade, and Mingle to Invite.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Camp. Saul, Jonathan, Abner, Eliab. Saul. The proud Philistine Host is come in view, And e're the Fight, does our faint Men subdue: We strive to raise their Courages in vain, As soon we might recall them who last Fight were slain. Eli. They hope no succour from their Spears or Shields, Against those Troops that cover Dannum Fields: Whose tender Grass, supprest beneath their weight, Too much resembles our approaching Fate. For so our Neighbours court their great Success, That nothing, but our Fears, can more encrease. Abn. I saw them, Sir, as on their Hill they stood; Their Spears out-vy'd the thickest of our Wood: Our Men at Distance cannot make a shew So great as theirs in closest Order do. Yet still their Camp did with new Aids abound, Which had they wanted, they had never found. But Succours crowd to them who needed none; As Streams still to the o'er-charg'd Ocean run. Jon. To Conquer us they do not want Supplies, Our selves are grown our greatest Enemies; Who, by our Cowardise and base Despair, Pull on our Heads the Mischiefs which we fear. Like timorous Fools, who often blindly run On greater Dangers than they strive to shun. [Shouts without. Eli. From the Foes Camp loud Acclamations ring, Like joyful Shouts made after Conquering. Saul. Enquire the Causeâ [To El. who goes out. Their Confidence does soar too great a height, To boast a Victory before the Fight. Jon. May it ev'n to the highest pitch aspire; It then must fall, when it can mount no higher. Abn. Why then, my Lord, do we dejected lie, Since we are quite as low as they are high? Jon. The fault is ours, who truckle to their Pride, And no Defence against it dare provide: From our mean Spirits they their Rise derive; They had no Wings, but what our Fears did give. Our Fortunes did in equal ballance lie, Till we, by sinking first, rais'd them so high. And thus exalted, they must so remain, Till we, by rising, bring them down again. We must their Fury calm, or must endure; Who ne're attempts can ne're effect a Cure. Saul. My Jonathan, how am I blest, my Son, [Embracing him. To see my Age thus by thy Youth out-done! Thy Virtue clearly through those Clouds does shine, Whose Darkness has eclips'd the Rays of mine. O Abner! how can we of Conquest miss, [To Abner. When aided with a Courage great as this! Our Enemies may their vast Numbers boast, But thou art to be priz'd above their Host. [To Jonathan. Jon. All I possess I owe, Dread Sir, to you, From whom my Courage, as my Life, I drew. But Eliab comesâ [Enter Eliab. Saul. What made the Shouts so loud? Eli. The different Passions, Sir, of either Crowd. They did from Hope in the Foes Camp proceed; In ours, Despair did the sad Out-cry breed. Sa. What cou'd beget such Hope and such Despair? Eli. That which will raise your Wonder, Sir, to hear. While on their several Hills both Armies stood, Like Conqu'rours theirs, but ours like Men subdu'd, A Noise from the Philistine Camp was sent, Like Thunder ratling through the Air it went! Nothing cou'd more augment their Souldiers Fear, But that more dreadful sight which after did appear. Jon. What was the sight? Eli. A Manâ(if such he was, who, in esteem, Did a Contraction of their Army seem) With strange contempt descends into the Plain, Pressing the Earthâ Which Nature made him fitter to sustain: Such was his Stature, he o're-look'd the Hill, As much as that the Valley he did fill. A Dwarf (for such the rest seem'd) march'd before, Sweating beneath a Target which he bore. Thus usher'd, tow'rds our Camp his way he took, Viewing our Men with a disdainful Look; Then made a Challenge in a Voice so loud, It drowned all the Clamors of the Crowd. Jon. What was the Substance of it? let us hear. Eli. These, or like these, the words he utter'd were. Why, Men of Israel, will ye chuse to die? The doubtful Chance of War why will ye try? What need you hasten your whole Armies Fall? Save, save your Lives, and let one die for all. This day, a Man to answer me prepare, (If any can so much o'ercome his Fear) Between us let the Armies Cause be try'd; We will the Difference with our Blood decide: Israel shall with her Champion lose the Field, Or the Philistines with Goliah yield. Will no one come?âBut one why do I call? A thousand of you were too fewâcome all. Saul. But were our Men so much to Fear betray'd, None durst accept the Challenge which he made? Eli. Who singly cou'd engage with him in Fight Who vanish'd your whole Army with his sight? Jon. Let the whole Army tremble at his words, And dread them more than the Philistine Swords; Though he cou'd Do as much as he can boast, I will go meet him, were he all the Host: And, arm'd with Israel's Cause, kill Israel's Foe. [Is going. Saul. Come back, my Sonâ I charge you on your Duty, do not go. Jon. Ah, Sir, must Israel be in this Distress, While none the Wrongs she suffers dares redress! Make me her Champion, and her Foes shall see That Courage which this Army wants, in me. Saul. Urge me no more, you must not, shall not go; Or go from me for ever if you do: Rather than you, I wou'd my self expose, And naked dare the Vengeance of my Foes. Jon. Staying I lose the Glory I have won. Saul. Obedience is the Glory of a Son. But you have got a Name you cannot lose While Valour in the Rank of Virtues goes: Too well your Enemies at Micmash knew, You could alone their Garrisons subdue: But if for Fame you from your Duty swerve, You lose what you endeavour to preserve. Jon. Why have I here two Evils left to chuse, The King meditates alone. And must take one, though I shou'd both refuse? I must neglect what I entirely love, And false to Duty or to Honour prove. Duty shall be observ'd, let Honour go; I glory in its loss to lose it so. Saul. Heav'n has my Marriage with two Daughters blest, Of all the Treasures Nature gives possest. Go Abner, and this Promise publick make, That he who dares the Combat undertake, If he succeeds, shall, as his just Reward, Be to the Elder Merab's Bed preferr'd: He shall be next my Jonathan in Pow'r, And only give the Gyant's Head for Dow'r. Jon. Rewards like these, ev'n Cowards might inflame, Riches and Pow'r work more on such than Fame. [Exeunt. Doeg alone. Do. Now Fate to grant my frequent Wish complies, And smiling seems to say, Now Doeg rise: By Shallum's Death the way is clear and free, He long has stood between my Hopes and me. The Place of Armor-bearer to the King, (The only Office worth my Coveting) Which, by Saul's word, was long before made mine As soon as envy'd Shallum did resign; Who by his Deathâ Has giv'n the King an opportunity To keep his Promise, and be just to me. Yet I in vain on Saul and Fate depend, Unless my self in this my self befriend: For still new Thoughts invade a Prince's Breast, By which the old are wholly dispossest. But, that I may renew for me his Care, I must repeat my own Attendance here: He shou'd be often in his Sov'raign's eye, Who is ambitious in his Heart to lie. [Exit. David, Eliab. Eli. Enquire no moreâI know your haughty Mind; To see the Fight was what you most design'd. To Bethlem, Boy, and move in your own sphere, You are unskill'd, and have no bus'ness here. Dav. Sure, to behold a Fight, and not engage, Does neither want Experience nor Age: These only need be in the Actors shown; Though Cowards cannot fight, they may look on. Eli. Be gone, I say, and let our Father know, How I and all thy other Brethren do: You will be mist at home, and must not stay; A Messenger should not his time delay. Dav. No more will I when Glory calls away. I have not yet old Samuel's words forgot, Who said this Kingdom shou'd become my Lot. Eli. You build your Hopes on what he said, in vain: First know the means which must your Crown obtain. Dav. How can I doubt the truth of what he said, Who have such proof of his great Knowledge made? Ev'n thus to Saul he a like Message brought, And gave a Kingdom which he never sought. Besides, this Thought has still possest my Mind, That I for Pow'r and Greatness was design'd: When other Youths in ev'ry Exercise Made me their Chief, presaging thus my Rise: And I then kept a more than usual State, Fancying I was what I did personate. Eli. If then you must o'er Israel bear sway, You shou'd attain it by some noble way. A Crown shews dim that is not merited, And sits but loose on a Usurper's Head. Dav. A ready way now to Deserve is shewn, And the first step to raise me to the Throne; Propitious Heav'n does put it in my hand, To save the People which I must command. My self against the Challenger will go, Fall with my Country, or destroy its Foe. Eli. You may with ease Design great Deeds like this; The difficulty in Performance is. Dav. In vain the Gyant braves all Israel's Host, And does his Strength and his Experience boast: Let him with those small Odds his Fancy please, My Courage gives me more Advantages. Eli. This rash Design you may too late repent; But if you are resolv'dâ That way directs you to the General's Tent. [Exeunt severally. Doeg alone. Do. How things conspire while I am yet below, With their united Force to keep me so. The King admits no Visit or Redress, Grief does so much his Royal Mind possess: So that I must defer my suit a while, Till Saul and Fate clear up again, and smile: But see Prince Adriel, he does displeas'd appear, [Enter Adriel, But will find greater Cause to be so here. Welcome from Gibea, Sir, your stay at Court I hope has been successful, though but short. Adr. Thanks, my good Friend, thy Wishes still are kind; How blest were I had Merab the same mind! But she does all her Pride and Scorn retain, Does still my Passion and my Flame disdain. In this fixt and immoveable she is, Though very Woman in all else but this. Yet still her Beauties so prevailing prove, I must that Rigour which torments me love. My Passion great as her Contempt does grow, And, like that, is unalterable too. But, what is worst of all my Miseries, The more I follow her the more she flies. So some fair Flow'r shuns the rough angry Winds, Still bending forward from the quick pursuit, Which pressing on, does that still farther press, And thus it self spoils its own Happiness. Do. I grieve, my Lord, that you this Cross have met, But more, that you must find a greater yet: With which I will acquaint you in the Tent; It will not here be so convenient. Adr. Let us retireâ Does it in all the pow'r of Fate remain, To lay more weight on than I now sustain? It cannot be, Fate has no trouble more, No burthen which I have not born, in store. [Exeunt. After several Shouts, Saul and Jonathan discover'd in the Tent Royal. Abner and David enter to them. Sa. What Shouts are these which through the Camp resound? Ab. Sir, distrest Israel has a Champion found. This Youth, who lately to the Army came, Does bravely, to his Honour and our Shame, Accept the Challenge we did all decline. Sa. Alas! what Rashness urges this Design? How can he hope that, wanting Strength and Skill, He shou'd a Gyant, and experienc'd, kill? Can he be able, with his single hand, To meet that Force our Army dares not stand? Dav. Did want of Years defect of Courage shew, You might, with Reason, judge, Sir, as you do; Valour and Life Heav'n does together give, These no addition can from Time receive. Sa. Courage in Action only is descry'd; The Brave and Base are equal while untry'd. Then to confirm the Truth of what you said, Produce some Proofs of Valour you have made. Dav. Once, Sir, as by my Father's Flock I stood, Behold, a Lyon from the Neighb'ring Wood Snatch'd up a new-yean'd Lamb, and bore away In his grim Jaws the faintly bleting Prey. I soon was with the Sight and Cry alarm'd, And, Lyon-like, with my own Courage arm'd, Pursu'd the Ravisher, who scorn'd to fly, But, facing, crusht his Prey, and laid it by: Then with his Tail giving his Side a stroke, His wonted Rage and Fury to provoke, Boldly I seiz'd his Beard, and made him roar Louder than he had made himself before. As he my Lamb, I did his Carcass tear, And made him all the Pains he threatned bear. And as this Lyon, so a Bear I slew; Let this procure me Credit, Sir, with you. Were greatest Spirits in largest bulks exprest, The Elephant would be the Noblest Beast: But the small Tiger's Heart out matches his More than his Limbs exceeds the other's size. Jon. How eminent a Virtue has he shown! My Father's Court has not its equal known; There, Politick Designs and State-Affairs, Bus'ness, Intrigues of Love, and thousand Cares, Insinuate themselves in every Breast, And Virtue is dislodg'd and dispossest: The Shadow some, perhaps, for Interest use, And thus disguising Vice, the World abuse; Yet that fair Out-side to a Virtuous Mind, Is guilded Dross to the true Ore refin'd. All this spoke asids, while Saul and Abner are in Consultation about David. Do not, Great Sir, this generous Offer slight, [To Saul. Since he will undertake it, let him fight; The Brave and Forward no Obstruction know, Who dares encounter, may subdue his Foe: Courage that leads him on, may bring him back, This to it self does all things easie make. Sa. Rashly to cast the Fortune of my Land, Thus on a single and a feeble Hand, The Dictates of my Reason do deny. Jon. Reason, Sir, rather prompts you to comply: For tho' the Match does much unequal seem, Between the monstrous Challenger and him; Yet, who both Armies does survey, may see Between them just the same Disparity; And he who of this Victory despairs, Can hope no more our Men shou'd conquer theirs. Abn. You need not doubt, Sir, which to make your Choice, Since single Combat has the Peoples Voice Thus at the worst, you but one Subject lose; By Battle all the Army you expose: Your Person, Off-spring, Subjects, and your Throne, All hope too of Recovery will be gone; To pay small Tribute all your Loss will be, And better part with that than Liberty. Sa. Then go, brave Youth, and may'st thou meet Success, Great as the Courage which thou dost express. Jon. And may thy Arm o're the Philistin be As pow'rful as thy Worth has been o're me. Sa. See that he has a Suit of Armor on, Our Care for him cannot enough be shown. Da. I, but my Sling, no other Arms will use, It is the safest Weapon I can chuse: Arming my self, I arm my Enemy too, And by Example make him Cautious grow; But seeing me approach him unprepar'd, He will not stand so much upon his Guard: Thus I shall, naked, an Advantage gain, Which arm'd, I should expect to find, in vain. Men soon are vanquisht, when of Conquest sure, And in most danger live, when most secure. [Exeunt. Adriel, Doeg. Adr. Must Merab the Reward of Vict'ry be? This was an Ill I never cou'd foresee! Shall she, in whom alone I can be blest, Be, by another, while I live possest! Tho' I without her, some short time might live, I hardly can the Thoughts of this survive, To see her proffer'd to another Bed, Who proudly mine, tho' courted to it, fled. Do. No way to hinder it but this I know, To fight the Giant, and deserve her so. Adr. But should I be in doubtful Combat slain, I lose what I endeavour to obtain: Perhaps thro' Fear all will the Fight decline, Then still my Hopes are fair to make her mine. Do. Yet thus you get her Father on your side, A Title too which cannot be deny'd; Duty and Right will then your Wishes aid, And must effect what Love in vain essay'd. Adr. Alas! ev'n these wou'd weak and fruitless prove, To bend her high and stubborn Heart to love. Her Father of her Person may dispose; Her Love no Father, no Obedience knows; And all my Hopes wou'd perish by this course, For by compelling I incense her worse. While I consider, you enquiry make If any does the Combat undertake; Let him the Merit of his Conquest boast, I will deserve her best by loving most. [Exeunt severally. SCENE, A Field. After several shouts some Philistins run over the Stage. 1. Phil. Fly, fly away, behold our Strength, our Shield! Behold the mighty Gathite Champion kill'd! [Exeunt. Several other Philistins follow. 2. Phil. The Hand that cut off great Goliah's Head, With the same blow struck all our Army dead. [Exeunt. David, as in pursuit, kills one flying. Da. Thus may the Enemies of Israel fall, May Death and strange Confusion seize them all. To him Jonathan and Abner. Jon. In vain, Sir, you pursue the Enemy, [To David. Wing'd with their Fear, beyond your reach they fly; Their Speed encreases at the thoughts of you. Da. Their Fright, not my Pursuit, does make it so. Jon. Come, let us, Sir, to the King's Tent repair, You will receive a joyful Welcome there: The greatest Thanks that Israel can pay, Will be the least you have deserv'd to day. Da. Too high, my Lord, you my mean Glory raise; My Merit is not equal to your Praise: Fighting in Saul's and Israel's defence, Is, for it self sufficient Recompence. [Exeunt. SCENE, The Tent Royal. Saul, Adriel, Doeg. Sa. How do my Joys fast on each other flow! My Childrens Health, and Conquest o're my Fo! You come, a pleasing Message to relate, [To Adriel. And meet News here acceptable as that: Methinks you do not Joy enough express. Adr. It would be greater if its Cause were less. [Aside. Small Joys, Sir, from our Breasts do highly flow, The greater with a slower motion go; While, to be seen, each crowds to get away, They stop the Passage and prolong their stay. [Shouts. Do. These joyful Shouts proclaim the Victor near. Adr. Rather wou'd I behold the Enemy here. [Aside. Jonathan, David, Abner, Eliab, with Goliah's Head. Jon. Behold here, Sir, the Man to whom you owe Your safety, and Goliah's overthrow; Presents David to Saul. Whom the Philistine Army dreaded more, Than ours their boasting Champion heretofore. Da. Accept this [The Head., Sir, and what besides I bring, Zeal for my Country, Honour for my King. Sa. Welcome, my Son, to Israel and to me, Thy Present cannot half so grateful be: Thy Valour which has brought this Head away, Secur'd and fix'd the Crown on mine to day. But let us not great Debtors thus become, Yet still be kept in Ignorance, to whom. Thy Name, and thy Extraction declare, That all thy Friends may in thy Glory share. Da. Since you vouchsafe to know, Sir, who I am, Bethlem my Country, David is my Name; My Father Jess, an honest Man, tho' Poor, Who loves the King tho' he can do no more. Sa. Your Brothers long have serv'd me in my War; They Men of Courage and Deserving are. Da. To visit them I hither came, which past, I back to Bethlem and to Jess must hast; And so for leave become your Supplicant. Sa. You ask the only thing I must not grant: I cannot eas'ly with a Treasure part, So much endear'd, as you are to my Heart; You must with us to Gibeah repair, Tast Joys of Peace, as well as Toils of War: Since our great Happiness was gain'd by you, It is but just you should partake it too. [Exeunt Jon. and Da. Jon. Stay, Sir, and let me tell you e're you go, You gain'd a Conquest which you did not know; When you cut off the great Goliah's Head, You then my Heart, your Valour's, Captive made. Da. That Valour you are pleas'd, Sir, to admire, Was only what your Presence did inspire; And all I have perform'd to that I owe; Who could want Courage when beheld by you! And since that Courage I from you derive, You only merit the Applause you give. Jon. Alas! there is but little Virtue shown, In him, who while another fights, looks on: Can he that other bold and forward make, To Actions which he dares not undertake? Few Men take Courage from their General's sight; They best by his Example learn to fight. No, Sir, you do your self an Injury, Ascribing what is only yours, to me. I saw with Wonder and Astonishment, How fearless you to meet the Giant went. I saw your Danger with more fear than you, And did with greater Joy your Safety view: Yet griev'd that I cou'd no Desert pretend, Which might me to your Friendship recommend; But from your Goodness I this Hope conceive, That what I cannot merit you will give. Da. Were it, my Lord, a Present worthy you, How readily wou'd I my Heart bestow: But you, Sir, are too high, and I too low. Your Breast is for my Heart too rich a Case, And mine for yours too humble and too base. Jon. Compar'd with you, 'tis I am Mean and Poor, Your Worth a loftier flight than mine does soar, And Virtues which I want you have in store: Only in this we may unequal prove, That I do more abound than you in Love: Yet you the tenders of that Love despise, And slight his Heartâ Who yours does more than greatest Treasures prize. Da. Sooner would Misers proffer'd Gold refuse, Sooner Ambitious Souls, Retirement chuse; Sooner wou'd Lovers, when they may obtain, Neglect that Bliss they su'd for long in vain: Your Favour is an Honour so sublime, That but to wish it, were in me a Crime; But more, shou'd I be backward to receive, What you so freely condescend to give. Jon. Take then and keep the Empire of my Heart, [Embracing him. And render me in yours an equal part; Let mine be still with you and yours with me, And but one Soul in both our Bodies be. Da. Thus I receive the Heart which you resign, [Bowing. And give you back the poor exchange of mine; At this low rate thus I your Friendship hold, As Men for Trifles purchase Ophir's Gold. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE, A Room of State. Michol, Azuba, weeping. Mi. Sister, your Sorrows too imperious grow, Or stop their Course, or they will overflow; Small Streams at first may eas'ly be withstood, But know no Laws when swol'n into a Flood. Az. Streams which within their Channels gently run While they do meet no Opposition, Impetuous grow when Men wou'd stop their Course, And make the Way they are deny'd, by force. Mi. Yet greatest Torrents quickly wou'd be dry'd, Were the Recruits they still receive deny'd; But smallest Brooks above their Banks must rise, Which from the Clouds find too profuse Supplies. Az. Unjustly we against the Clouds complain, If they too largely spend themselves in vain; They are but Vapours the Sun-beams exhale, And these withdrawn, they down again must fall. Too like these Mists am Iâ Who by your Brother rais'd to this great height, Tho' I, (as they the Sun's) ecclipse his Light, Must melt in Show'rs now he has left my sight. Mi. Those Clouds in mod'rate Show'rs lament their Fate, But you deplore yours at too large a rate. Az. They with the Rays they miss shall be re-blest; Those which I want may never be possest: What Joys with wretched Azuba can stay, While Jonathan their Cause is still away? Shall I wear Smiles and Pleasure on my Brow, While he encounters some stern frowning Foe? Shall I my self with soft Attire invest, While He is with uneasie. Armour prest? Though Fate our Separation has design'd, Our Loves and Fortunes shall not be disjoyn'd. Mi. Too much you share what he does undergo; Which wou'd increase his trouble but to know. Your Sorrow flows to an unjust excess; I am his Sister, yet lament him less. Az. O Michol you too unexperienc'd are, To judge between a Wife's and Sister's care. Your Brother's Absence only troubles you; I dread the Mischiefs may from that ensue. That time when you with sweet Repose are blest, Is that by which my Miseries are encreast. Death does to me in thousand shapes appear, All which (though he can meet but one) I fear. And though small Slumbers close awhile my Eyes, Still I behold his fancy'd Miseries. Or, if indulg'd with any pleasing Dream, I find it makes my Sorrows more extream. The Miser thus with his day toils opprest, In the short time he gives himself to rest, Finds the lov'd Object of his thoughts remain, And, dreaming, acts his Labours o're again: But when he wakes and seeks about in vain, The acquisition of his sleeping pain, He thinks the Summ diminish'd from his Store, And, as if real, does the loss deplore. Mi. I cannot grant your Love may greater be; Since how it should is still a Mystery; For the same Blood runs in his Veins as mine: But you came to him from a distant Line. My Brother from my Infancy I knew, He was a Stranger, till of late, to you. Az. Tho' from one Womb you did your Birth receive, Still you are two; that, Life to both might give; But cou'd not the same Mind in both infuse, For different things in different ways you chuse: Your Kindness is but from Relation grown, Remove but this and that wou'd vanish soon. A Nobler Object do's beget my Love, Which like it self, will firm and lasting prove. We did not in the Humours disagree; But were all Concord and all Sympathy. His Soul in mine, and mine in his was known, And thus the Husband and the Wife are one. What News? [Enter Orpha. Orp. The General, Madam, waits without. Az. Admit him; his Arrival at the Court Do's something of great Consequence import. [Enter Abner. Welcome, my Lord, what Message do you bear? Abn. Good, as our Friends can wish, or Enemies fear. Madam, the King, your Lord, and all the Men Safe and victorious are return'd agen: By their Commands to wait on you I come, Before next Watch themselves will be at home. Az. My Lord return'd! I now shall grieve no more, He, with his Presence, will my Joys restore. Mi. The King and Jonathan come back in Peace! We cou'd not hope a greater Happiness. We heard the Enemie's Numbers were so great, All we dur'st wish, was but a safe Retreat: And are they all return'd victorious now! Abn. Madam they areâ And that we to a single Valour owe, Which has perform'd more than our Host cou'd do. For the Philistins, tho' so numerous, That half their Army might have conquer'd us; Yet in a Gyant's Strength did so confide, That chusing him the Champion on their side, They did the bravest of our Men invite To end the Quarrel in a single Fight. But none against the Monster wou'd appear, (So far were we subdued by our own Fear.) Till an advent'rous Youth, did with one Blow Their Champion, and their Army did over-throw. Az. My Lord, the Manner of the Fight declare; For more of that brave Deed I long to hear. Abn. After the Monster with his usual Boast Breath'd loud Defiance to our trembling Host, He stood expecting our Reply awhile: When lo a Youth unknown descends our Hill, Who did, besides his Courage and his Sling No Arms offensive, or defensive bring. Only to these five Pebble-stones he took, Smooth as their Stream, tho' rugged to his Look: These in a Scrip he putâ And tow'rds the Gathite march'd in such a way, As if he had not gone to Fight, but Play. Mi. How cou'd he look on him? Abn. With far less dread Than we were able to behold him dead. He laugh'd to hear Goliah call him Boy, And give his Sling the Name of Childish Toy: But when the Host of Israel he defy'd, Our angry Champion with a Stone reply'd, Which skilfully he to his Sling did fit, And at the Monster's Fore-head levell'd it. The well-aim'd Stone did upwards, singing, fly, Young David's Triumph, th'other's Elegy, And hit the Mark which we believ'd too high. Az. He and his End alike prodigious were; But pray, my Lord, let us what follow'd hear. Abn. Thus laid along the Youth bestrides his Foe, Not to insult, as meaner Victors do: But to secure the Conquest he had wone, Which cou'd not be with too much Caution done. He from the Scabbard draws the Monstrous Sword, And turns its Edge on its more Monstrous Lord; And lifting it on high, with no small Pain, He let it fall on his great Neck again: It sever'd Head and Shoulders with one Blow, And, with its Weight, did more than Strength cou'd do. Their Champion kill'd, the base Philistins fly, And leave the Youth a double Victory. Mi. In this Relation you have made us, Sir, You have oblig'd us and the Conquerer. Your Rhetorick has for us Diversion made, And do's a Lustre to his Actions add. Abn. My self too mean an Orator I own To give him Fame, or you Diversion. Yet, Madam, honour'd with Commands from you, I thus my Duty, tho' my Weakness, shew. But, Madam, now I know the King is near, And I for his Reception must prepare. I humbly take my leaveâ [Bowing. Az. Let us go too: My Lord, we must prepare as well as you: We shou'd our Joys for them but ill express, If we shou'd meet them in a Mourning-dress. [Exeunt. Adriel, Merab. Me. How! Marry'd to a Stranger! and obscure! Thus I alone shou'd Israel's Fate endure: While they escape Philistin Slavery, They basely wou'd impose a worse on me. Adr. The King has promis'd and it must be so, You to the Son of Jesse's Bed must go. Wife to an humble Bethlemite must be, Of Juda's Tribe the meanest Family. Me. I wou'd stoop lower e'er accept of thee. Adr. Do, court his Bed, more than you mine despise; Yet think where all your State, your Greatness lies: This is to me Revenge sufficient: [Exit. Me. Sir, I must tell you, you are insolent. Ha! With what strange Contempt he's gone! A Tyrant thus depriv'd of Pow'r and State His Slave's Insult o'er what they tremble at. Yet he turns Rebel to my Eyes in vain, One Smile my former Empire will regain. And tho' awhile I this Submission shew, I shun a worse Contempt which I am falling to. I will not go to that mean Stranger's Bed, Tho' he a King's and Father's Promise plead: Tho' he has vanquish'd the Philistin Host, He shall no Conquest over Merab boast. Yet I will goâ To see his Entrance at the Palace-Gate, And then despise him at his greatest height. [Exit. SCENE, The Palace. After several Shouts, a Sound of Trumpets; Merab with other Ladies appear in one Window; Michol, Azuba and others over-against them in another Window: After the Trumpets some enter carrying Goliah's Spear, Helmet and Coat, then a Sett of Musick; after them some with the Sword and Head, usher'd in by Doeg: Then four Women with Bows and Garlands; Eliab bare, Saul, Jonathan and David with a Garland, and his Sling, follow'd by Abner, and the King's Guards. The Women sing. SONG. 1 Wom. The Field is wone, our Foes are put to flight. 2. Wom. They had not Courage to support the Fight. 1. Wom. They saw their Champion's Head cut off, That Head which Israel's Arms did scoff; 2. Wom. And now they fly, as if the Blow Had wounded all the Army too. Chorus. Mighty Saul his Thousand kill'd, David his Ten Thousand slew, They forc'd the pow'rful Foe to yield: What cannot Saul and David do! While the SONG is singing David bows to all the Ladies, but makes a more solemn Complement to Michol. The Song ended, the Pomp passes-over the Stage, then Merab speaks. Mer. How! Do's my Birth or Beauty merit less! That he to Michol made his chief Address! Do's he her Favour more than mine affect? Or has Saul's Promise caus'd this Disrespect? And the proud Boy thus triumphs over me, As a sure Trophy of his Victory! If either; (tho' I his mean Love despise,) I will revenge this Injury to my Eyes: For he who dares contemn and slight their Fire, Shall by my Anger's fiercer Flames expire. [Exit, And all the Ladies. The SCENE changes to a large Room of State, with a Throne and other Seats in it. The Pomp enters again, the Women singing, while Saul, Jon. and David take their Places. Second SONG. 1. Wom. See how the curst Philistins fly away! See how disperst about the Fields they stray! 2. Wom. They fly when no one do's pursue; 1. Wom. So the Guilty use to do. 2. Wom. And who has our Deliv'rance wrought? 1. Wom. David out of Bethlehem brought. Chorus. Mighty Saul his Thousand kill'd, David his Ten Thousand slew, They forc'd the pow'rful Foe to yield: What cannot Saul and David do! After the SONG the four Men that carry'd Goliah's Armour, at the Sound of the Trumpets enter and dance a Martial Dance, while the Trumpets sound a Levet. That ended, the Women dance to Wind-Musick, and at last all together lay their Garlands (as the Men had their Swords) at David's Feet: Whereat Saul rises hastily and makes signs to the Attendants to be gone; they all go out; and after them Jon. and David bowing retir'd; the King walks disorderly about. Sa. Still with the cursed Noise my Ears are fill'd, My Thousand I, but he Ten Thousand kill'd! The Soldiers love no Name but his to hear, The People call him their Deliverer: Nay my own Servants do their Charge neglect, And slighting me, pay him their whole Respect. What then remains, but Saul to be remov'd, To raise the Man who is so well belov'd? Have they no other way to make him shine, But adding to his Fame to lessen mine? Must I, like some high Tow'r by time impair'd, On my Foundation see another rear'd? Spoil'd of that Head which did tow'rds Heav'n aspire, Be only us'd, to raise another higher! No, I will stop him e'er he grows too tall; Israel shall know no greater Man than Saul. Yet still my Looks on him must pleasant be; The Smiling, is the dangerous, Enemy. I will so fast my Favours on him press, That he shall sink beneath my Kindnesses. [Exit. Adriel enters and goes over the Stage after him. Jon. David, Azuba, Michol. Jon. What Pleasures do's the Marry'd-pair possess! Pleasures which oft'nest reap'd do more encrease. Others are height'ned by less frequent Use; These oftest gather'd do most Fruit produce; Ev'n time which do's all other things destroy, In adding to my Years augments my Joy: And still I do discover, at each View, New Flames in me, new Beauties spring in you. Az. Still may my Lord as dear to Israel be, As my Affection renders him to me. And may he find when Heav'n shall take Saul hence, In all his Subjects my Obedience. Jon. Of that I must a farther Trial add To the great Proofs I have already made: Your Love which wholly you devote to me, Must now imparted to another be. [Presenting David. Him as my Friend into your Breast receive; He will deserve more than you have to give. Da. My Lord is pleas'd to be so much my Friend, To find out something in me to commend; That since he has vouchsaf'd me his Esteem, The World may not condemn that Choice in him. But, Madam, your impartial Eye will find Those Failings whose Concealment he design'd. Az. Shou'd I believe, Sir, the most curious Eye Cou'd any Fault in so great Merit spy, I to your Virtue shou'd become unjust, And wrong a Judgment I have Cause to trust. [Turning to Jon. But both have been so well to me made known, To question them wou'd argue I have none. Jon. Michol, he must within your Breast be free, What he receives is doubly paid to me. Da. When first your Brother took me to his Heart, I thought he cou'd no other Bliss impart; And that he had profusely spent his Store: Such was my Joy I cou'd not covet more. But, Madam, honour'd with your Smiles, I find A long Reserve of Blessings was behind. Mi. My Brother's Choice I cannot discommend, And must esteem whom he has made his Friend. Aside ...Much on my Country's Score to you I owe, Your matchless Valour has subdu'd its Foe, And gain'd a Conquest over Michol too.... Aside Da. Madam, to you I owe what I have done. I had not gain'd that Victory so soon But that the Gyant was your Enemy, Which weaken'd him and did enable me. Your Beauties greater, than his Strength appear, And more to be admir'd than that they are: They have perform'd what he cou'd never do, And made his Conqueror their Captive now. Mi. To gain great Conquest cheaply, we must own A Privilege indulg'd to you alone: I no such Victory o'er you can boast: Or if I can, my self as much have lost. [Aside. Doeg Enters. Do. The King, Sir, out of his abundant Grace, Confers on you the Armour-bearer's Place; It is a Favour you have merited. Da. The Kings Rewards my poor Deserts exceed; Men may receive, but can have no Pretence To what kind Heav'n do's bounteously dispense. Jon. Sir, a just Title to that Place you have, It was the least my Father's Promise gave. Do. It was too muchâBut I shall find a time [Aside. To take Revenge, great as my Hate on him. [Exit. Mi. Beauty and Virtue have alike been kind, That to adorn his Face, and This his Mind. [Viewing David. Just such a Blush the Rosy-morn puts on, But his continues, that is quickly gone. His Looks have no less Charms than Ophir's Mine, His Eyes, bright as its Parent Sun-beams shine. Beauties like these in vain we hope to find In all that Art can work on Woman kind; And the best Spirit Man e'er boasted is Only a fainter Counterfeit of his. Oh, what Resistance can that Virgin make, Whom such united Pow'rs as these attaque! Jon. and David are discoursing together this while. Da. I from the Terrace first receiv'd my Wound; Viewing the Ladies there with eager Eyes, No Beauty did, like hers, my Heart surprize; And I from that A sure Defence against all others found. Jon. I much commend your Choiceâ The Menage of your Love to me commit, Michol and Saul shall both accept of it: They neither can refuse that Happiness, So proffer'd, which themselves shou'd rather press. [Exeunt. Merab. Mer. Unhappy Merab, whom constraint does force To chuse one evil to avoid a worse! From David I to Adriel must go, And condescend to what I scorn'd till now. Chear'd with my Smiles he to the King is gone To make his Passion and his Interest known, For I am his: by this expedient I shall the Mischiefs, I more dread, prevent. What News, my Lord? [Adriel Enters Adr. The King is still averse. And will not hear my Reasons nor my Prayers. In vain I urg'd, you my mine by promise were; He, of no promise, but his own, would hear. I left him angry and inflexible. Mer. And I will follow his Example still. I will oppose whate're he does design, And only to what he denys encline. [Exeunt. Saul. A Chamber of State. Sa. All my designs do prosperously succeed; I soon shall from my Jealousy be freed: The height to which I gave him wings to fly, Makes all the Court malign him more than I. Doeg with envy sees him in that place, From which his Hopes were tumbled with Disgrace. And Adriel storms, he must supplanted be, By a poor Fortune and mean Family. Merab do's hate him, and I must improve That hatred still by pressing her to Love. Thus by my Favours he shall be undoen, Yet own his fall an obligation. Envy with shows of Love shou'd be conceal'd, Its pow'r to Hurt, is lost when once reveal'd. [Enter David. He comes, my looks must now Serene appear, The Sea is calmest when a Storm is near. Welcome, my Son, you to my Eye have brought, What last was represented to my thought. It was my Care, before you came, which way I should the Debts I owe your Valour pay. Da. Your Care, Great Sir, exceeds what I deserve; And I must long, to merit your past favours serve. All I cou'd do, had its reward before, Few Servants thus run on their Masters score. Sa. No, generous Youth, I still your Debtor am, You can a title to my promise claim. Which to confirm before I did design, But Merab's Will wou'd not consent to Mine. Yet I will see a Father's Pow'r made good, Nor by her Disobedience be withstood. Da. 'Tis Disobedience only to withstand A Princely Father's Negative Command; But urg'd, a Man she cannot Love, to chuse, It is no break of Duty to refuse. That Union only blessings do's beget, Where, as two Bodies, so two Souls are met; Which when constran'd, and the effect of force, From a great Blessing proves a greater Curse. And Fathers who compel their Children's love, From careful Parents cruel Tyrants prove, And when the Parents Kindness is destroy'd, It makes the Childrens Bond of Duty void. Sa. Is this Excuse design'd for Merab's sake, Or that he slights the Overtures I make? [Aside. Perhaps 'tis Michol do's possess his Heart; If so he shall the Secret soon impart. For one to raise him higher I must give, That from his Rise he may his fall receive.â Since Sir, for Merab this excuse you plead, I must believe you wou'd avoid her Bed. Perhaps her Sister is your greater care, Speak freely Son, I can as freely hear. Da. To say I do not pow'rful Beauties find, In Michols Face, but greater in her Mind, Would be to call my Eyes and Reason blind? This to admire her gives me just pretence, Yet, to aspire to her, were insolence. Sa. It takesâ [Aside. Michol I find has been your secret choice, Take her, my Son, you have her Father's voice. Nor let the thoughts of Joynture trouble you, Which easie as I ask, you can bestow. A Joynture I, by Custom, must require But it shall be to raise your Merits higher. Not but your Great Exploits already done, Intitle you to be your Monarch's Son: But that some Action to the World may prove, None equals you in Honour or in Love: You shall a Hundred of our Enemies slay, And for a dow'r only their heads shall pay. Da. Shall Michol at so mean a rate be priz'd! I thought a Thousand wou'd not have suffic'd. But since you please, Great Sir, it shall be done: I only blush she must be cheaply wone. [Exit. Sa. Go then, and may thy brave Attempt succeed. I wou'd excuse that Hundred for thy Head. The bold and forward Spirits which Princes dread, To mighty undertakings must be led; That while for Glory they no danger shun, They may at last beyond recovery run.â [Enter Adriel. I know you come to press me to consent, But I with Kindness will your pray'rs prevent; Your choice I have consider'd and approve, And were unjust shou'd I oppose your Love. Take her, and all the Blessings I can give. Ad. I can no greater than her self receive. Sa. Your Nuptials shall no longer be delay'd Then till fit preparations can be made. The Priest shall then confirm what I have done: For Saul and Heav'n consent to make you one. [Exeunt. Jonathan, David. Jon. Your News begets alike my Joy and Fear When I with your Success your Danger hear. I shou'd, like you, applaud my Father's Grant, Did it that too severe Condition want. But thoughts of Fear I must not entertain; Who knows your Valour, is afraid in vain. Da. Your Father cou'd no greater Favour do, Next giving Michol than to give her so. I best declare by making her this Dow'r The Greatness of my Passion and her Pow'r. But, Sir, too long at Gibeah I stay, Glory and Love admit not this delay. Jon. Must you, O! must you go so soon away? Yet go, and that you sooner may come back, My Guards and stronger Wishes with you take. Da. Let me but first Sir on your Sister wait And with her Smiles be Arm'd against my Fate. Farewel my Lord, I from your presence go [Embracing him. With more Reluctance than to meet the Foe. Jon. The Soul and Body take a leave like this When that on wing tow'rds Heaven and Glory is. Ravish'd with Joy, That hasts to get away; This, loth to part, strives to prolong its stay: But when it can no more the Flight oppose, Quits its weak holdâ And of the loss it suffers sensless grows. [Exeunt. Doeg. Do. In vain were all my Services for Saul, He, or despises, or forgets them all. And for Reward, (for which I long did serve) I meet Contempt, which I did ne're deserve. Not satisfy'd to give away my place, He proudly triumphs in my foul disgrace. Gives me the hated place of Messenger, Who to my Rival the glad News must bear: And now to make his Fame more Eminent, I with his Trophies must to Nob be sent: That when the Priests Goliah's Armour shew, They may Discourse of David's Victory too. Did I for this my Faith to Saul express! Flatter his Vice and sooth his Wickedness! No, I will have what I expected yet; Or take Revenge, and that will be as sweet. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. The Scene discovers a Tent, with a Throne in it; Saul alone: on the Right hand Jonathan and Azuba, on the left hand Michol. Enter at one door Trumpets and four Youths with Torches, then Adriel with Attendants: at the other door Wind Instruments and other Musick, after them four Virgins veyl'd with Torches, then Merab led by Abner: She fits by Michol, and Adriel between Abner and Eliab at Saul's feet. The Trumpets sound and then a Youth sings. SONG. O the Joys and Delights of the Marry'd pair! How lasting they are! When Virtue does prove The cheif object of Love; It kindles a fire That will never expire. Chorus. And lays a Foundation which none can remove. Then the Musick plays, after which a Virgin singsâ SONG. The Flames which from Riches or Beauty proceed Will quickly be dead: When Beauty decays Love no longer will blaze; If Riches do wast Love lessens as fast. Chorus. But Virtue makes Love like itself alway last. Youth Sings. Look up, Look up, brave Youth and see, Which among all these is She, In whose Love thou wou'dst happy be. Adriel rises and goes to Merab, (the Trumpets sounding) and presents her a large Writing, then a Virgin Sings. If you to favour him incline, Then declare it by this sign, Unveil and on him clearly shine. Merab and all the Virgins Unveil; she takes tho Writing from him; the Musick playing this while. The Priest enters follow'd by 2 other Priests; he gives a Cup to Saul, then Joyns the Couple, to whom Saul drinks, while the Chorus of all sings. Chorus. Let Blessings be joyn'd to the Bridegroom and Bride As firmly as they to each other are ty'd. Then the Youths and Virgins dance. Which being ended they go out: the Musick and Trumpets first, next the Youths and Virgins, then the Priests, then Adriel leading Merab follow'd by Saul, Jonathan, Abner, Azuba, Michol and the rest. The SCENE Changes to the Town. Eliab alone. Eli. Our House no longer shall the meanest be, My Brother has advanc't our Family: For rising Fav'rites as they higher go Raise by degrees their own Dependants so. For all who soar to Honour's lofty flight, Require Supporters to maintain their height. But see Abishaiâ [Enter Abishai. He went with David to procure the Dow'r, Which he must pay for Michol and for Pow'r. Cozen this quick return confounds my Guess, If you have fail'd, or met your wish'd success. Abi. Have you not, to be sure of Conquest learn'd, When your Victorious Brother is concern'd? Can you, who saw the great Goliah slain, Believe his Sword cou'd e're be drawn in vain? The Truth you doubt too well our Enemies know: He who dares all things, can effect them too. Two Hundred Heads do on his Triumph wait, With these he tow'rds the Tent is March'd in State, Where Saul do's Merab's Nuptials Celebrate. Eli. But say whence did their quick dispatch proceed? The hast you made, is wond'rous, as the Deed. Abi. As on our March from hence to Gath we were Some stragling Troops did on the Hills appear, But since their number far exceeded ours: (Number, which oft true Fortitude o'repowers.) Your Brother, as the best and safest way, Did, to surprize them, a close Ambush lay. Its good effect, Sir, you already know; Policy wrought what Arms cou'd never do. The wise thus fear what Mischiefs may be done, And by their Caution do those Mischiefs shun: While fools regardless what they venture at, By blind Attempts run headlong on their Fate. Eli. These shouts of Joy the King's return import, [Shouts. Let us make hast and meet him in the Court. Since we do first my Brother's Honours share, We shou'd not last our Joy for them declare. [Exeunt. Saul, Jonathan, Michol, David, A Room of State. Sa. 'Tis an unpleasant Offering he does make, [Aside. Which tho' I ask'd I never wish'd to take. Curse on his good Success, which makes me be His greatest Friend of his worst Enemy. But I too plainly my displeasure show.â Pardon if my acceptance seems too slow: [to David. Your Deed do's so my Admiration raise, That I was lost in thinking how to praise. But to declare how I your worth regard, Receive your wish'd and merited reward. [gives Michol. We must, when time the Course prescrib'd has run; Perform for you, what was for Merab done. [Exit. Da. Post on the Hours and use a Lovers hast, Yet spite of all too long that time will last. Tho', Madam, my best Deeds were mean and low, Yet I no longer must believe them so. They to Desert have gain'd a large Pretence, Since you are made their Noble recompence. Mic. Nothing can raise your Glory to a height, To which it has not took before its flight: Yet mean Rewards may make it lower seem, And suit its Merit to their own esteem. As when vain Men with blind Devotion, Offer up Incense to their God the Sun: Its Gloomy smoak do's his bright beams invest And clouds that light to which it was addrest. Jon. You are unjust to tast your bliss alone, Exempting him who makes your Joys his own. Methinks you might impart some little share, But you too Covetous have none to spare. Da. Our Happiness, if not enjoy'd by you Loses its Name, and ceases to be so. Who shou'd partake our greatest pleasure, more Than he whose bounty do's encrease our store? [Exeunt. Saul, in his Chamber of State. Sa. In vain my Plots to ruine him were laid, All my Revenge do's to his Greatness add: What I design'd to cloud him, gives him Light; As Gloworms take their Lustre from the Night. He makes my Envy and my Hate his Joy, And both to his advantage does employ. And when his Sword in Dangers I Engage, At once he tries, and triumphs o're, my Rage. Nor can my Fury longer be conceal'd; The Flame by its own Light will be reveal'd. I with his Fall must trust no other hand, But act, my self, the Mischiefs I Command. All sweet Revenge to scrup'lous Fools is lost, Who blush to take the thing they covet most [Exit. Jonathan enters; and seeing Saul go out angrily saysâ Jon. My Father's looks are alter'd, and I fear It do's portend some sudden Tempest near: Nor can I thro' the gathering Cloud descry Those blacker Mischiefs which behind it lye. I see the Thunder ready to break out, But at whose Head it's level'd still must doubt, Yet (grant Just Heav'n it may no Omen prove) I most am mov'd for him whom most I Love. But how can he incur my Father's Hate? Unless his Merits do appear too Great. Saul owes his Valour more than he can pay; And wou'd he quit his Score this wicked way? Thus Favours are on the Ungrateful lost, Who worst reward those who oblige them most. Yet why shou'd Jonathan suspicious grow, And Frame a Doubt whose Cause he do's not know? He is my Father, and he cannot be The Author of a Deed abhorr'd by me. But see my Friendâ [Enter David. Your hast, and your disorder'd looks, declare Something as ill as I have Power to Fear. Da. Pardon, my Lord, this unrespectful hast, This Crime and Visit may be both my last. Jon. Your last! how! why? O speakâyet Sir forbearâ But you may speakâand yet I shou'd not hear. Da. Then Sir, I take my leaveâ [Offers to go. Jon. âHold, David, no;â First kill me with your Newsâ And then I shall not miss you when you go. Da. The Kingâ Jon. âAlas! that Name renews my pain. Da. Then let me goâ Jon. No, I can hear again. Da. The King with Business and with Care opprest, To gain some Respire to his troubled Breast, Commanded me some Charming Ayre to play, To drive those Robbers of his Ease away. Scarce had I touch'd my Lutes delightful Strings, And Saul scarce heard their soft sweet Murmurings; When, lo! beginning from his Seat to rise, On me he cast his wild and threatning Eyes: That done, with both his Hands he grasp't his Crown, And strove and strove to press it further down. At each deep Note he sigh'd and bent his Brow, At each brisk Sound did light and pleasant grow. Yet still as he did quiet or disturb'd appear, Those different Looks begot alike my Fear. So that these Actions made me but too sure, My self had caus'd the Pains I came to cure. While this I thought he seiz'd his Jav'lin strait, And threw it at the Couch whereon I sate. And, but my foresight sav'd me from the Blow, I had not given you the Relation now. Jon. O my Prophetick Fear! too well I find, Where all the Rage I dreaded was design'd. It was no sudden Fit this Mischief wrought, But the Ripe product of long working thought. To shew Saul's hate you must avoid his sight, He still will envy, while he sees your Light. That dazles his weak Eyes; but if not seen Will give him leave to see things right again. Da. Yet I the utmost Saul can do will stand, Till I have kiss't your Beauteous Sister's hand. For, less your Father's Cruelty I Fear, Than shunning that, to be depriv'd of her. Jon. Come, let us go, your Danger urges hast, You from his Fury cannot fly too fast. For, since he let his Envy once appear, 'Twere vain to hope he wou'd restrain it there. He must in his first violence proceed, So to maintain the Justice of the Deed. [Exeunt. Saul Guards. Sa. His Flight betrays his Guilt, for he is gone, This do's confirm my just suspicion: For, when to clear a Doubt his Carriage rais'd, I both his Courage and his Conduct prais'd, And, with a look half pleas'd and angry, said, The Crown I wore wou'd better fit his Head: He blusht and guessing his designs were known, He took no Leave but swift as Thought was gone: But we lose time; pursue the Traitor strait, He is scarce gone beyond the Palace Gate.â Search Michol's Lodgings, those I most suspect, And bring his Headâ Or you shall forfeit yours for the Neglect. [Exeunt. Jonathan, David, Michol, in her Chamber. Mi. Since by this Tempest you are driv'n away, My Love forbids me to perswade your stay: Yet I can only with your want dispence, To shun a greater Inconvenience. Da. The Storm that drives me hence may quickly cease, And the wild Rage of Jealous Saul decrease: But if I do not to some shelter hast, I may be wrackt by the Pursuing blast. Jon. Till that is over and its Fury spent, Your flight to Nob must its pursuit prevent. There from its Violence you secure may be, As Ships at Anchor in their Harbour lye. [Enter Orpha. Orp. For Heav'ns sake, Sir, delay your fight no more, You are betray'd, Saul's Gaurds are at the Door. Hither by his Command they follow'd you: But the Respect they to the Princess owe, Forbids their Entrance, till they gain her leave, To execute the Orders Saul did give. Mi. The Garden Avenues are yet left free, Haste Sir that way, and leave the rest to me. I with fair Speeches will the Guards beguile, And gain some leisure for your Flight the while. [She and Orp. go out. Da. I hate that Life which Robs me thus of you, For thus preserving, you destroy me too. [Looking after her. So a Sick Miser views his Idol-wealth, Which he must part with to procure his Health; Abhors the Ease he must so dearly buy, Chusing the Pain before the Remedy. Jon. Love has so fill'd your breast with greater Care, There is no room for thoughts of Danger there. But you no longer must your fight delay, I will conduct you to the Garden-way: Nor wou'd I leave you thereâ But I shall more oblige you by my stay. Here I will Sound my Jealous Father's mind, And still inform you how he is inclin'd; For what he do's against your Life design, Shall still be frustrate till he first take mine. [Exeunt. Saul. Sa. Now Saul compose and calm thy troubled Breast; David no longer shall disturb thy rest: Snatcht from the Empire which too well he lov'd, The Fear he caus'd must be with him remov'd. No longer anxious Cares and Watchful Nights, Shall interpose to hinder my Delights; Nor shall the Crown which was a Blessing meant, The Joys it uses to bestow, prevent. For, that sweet Pow'r which Monarch's covet most, Ev'n in the fear of losing it is lost. Unhappy they whose troubles never sleep, But drive away what 'tis their work to keep. [Enter Guards. So, have you brought me back the Traitors Head? Off. The Traitor, Sir, beyond our reach was fled. Sa. How! let him scape! O horrid Treachery! You are Confederates and as bad as he. This slight excuse shall not my Rage appease. You shall all dye for his Accomplices. Off. We to the Princess Michol's Lodging went, As we were thither by your Order sent: But when we enter'd, we cou'd find no more, Than, that disguis'd, he fled but just before. Sa. What? did that Amorous Girl assist my Foe? Dares my own Blood like him Rebellious grow? I'le try since she my Vengeance did prevent, If she do's love so well to bear his punishment. Begoneâmake strait enquiry thro' the Town, He may be still within the Gates unknown. Let him and those who entertain him die; The Rebels hopes must be cut off, or I. I must be swift, or he will quickly be [Exeunt Guards. Above the reach of my Revenge and me. But see the Villan I more hate, my Son. [Enter Jonathan. Now, have you help'd off your Companion? You were unkind to let him go alone. Hence from my sight to thy Confederate go, [Stamps. Thou worse and greater Rebel of the two. Jon. That Name is Welcome, Sir, when given by you. But use not, Sir, your other Friends like me, You do your self too great an Injury. Your Subjects will to serve you be afraid, When greatest Merits with most hate are paid. Sa. All his Deserts I largely did reward, Yet he my Bounty did but ill regard: For after that had made him high and great, Glutted with Pow'r, but not contented yet; Led by unruly blind Ambition, As if too low, he did affect my Throne: And all the Debts I to his Sword did owe By this Design are fully cancell'd now. Jon. But, Sir, what Grounds do's your suspition find? Sa. I in his Looks and Actions read his Mind. Besides, his flight confirms it to be true, He guess'd, it seems, that I his Treason knew. Jon. His Guilt you shou'd not from his flight conclude, Ev'n Innocence might fly when so pursu'd. Sa. Curse of my Age! dost thou excuse his Crime, Since thou darst plead, do thou too die, for him. Saul throws a Jav'ling at him. He'scapes it and goes out; Saul follows him. Enter Michol, A Chamber. Mi. My Lovers danger and the search are past, Yet still the fright they rais'd in me do's last: Some Passenger thus newly come ashore, Scar'd with a Raging Tempest just before, Tho' past the Fury of the angry Main, Do's all his apprehension still retain: Fancies the Ground still rowling as the Ship, And giddy, at each step he takes do's slip. [Enter Merab. Ha! Merab! She like Comets do's appear, Which only shine to threaten Mischief near. Sisterâ Me. âYou may invent some other Name; Know, I am Sprung from Saul whom you disclaim: Nor can she be a Sister or a Friend, Who do's my Father's greatest Foe defend. Tho' David 'scap'd Saul's wrath in your disguise, Your Action has not cheated so his Eyes. The guilty deed too publickly is known, But you may Live to wish it still undone. Mi. I had not done it if the deed were ill; But it is good and I applaud it still. I wrong my Merit if I should repent Saving a Lover and an Innocent. Me. While blindly you your Kindness do misplace On that mean Man, you our high Stock debase. Mi. Merab, more blindly you misplace your scorn, He is not mean whom Virtue do's adorn. Without this great and lasting Treasure, Kings Are poor, inferiour, despicable things. Pow'r creeps below, while Virtue soars above; Virtue, the object of a Generous Love. Base minds are sway'd by Interest, or Design, But this alone shall guide and govern mine. Me. Virtue with you then seems a Nobler thing Than Duty to a Father and a King! Mi. When either do unjust Commands impose, We sin in our Obedience shown to those. Shou'd I run headlong to commit an ill, To satisfy a King's or Father's Will? Or, if they hate the Goodness which they see, Must complaisance contract the Guilt on me? If Saul Commands I shou'd recal my Love, Let him the Virtue whence it springs, remove: But to attempt it were a vain design, For that exceeds his Pow'r, as this do's mine. Me. Love on, and hug the Traitor in thy Breast, But know, fond Girl, he ne're shall be possest. My Father's rage swift as his fear shall be, And if it misses him, shall light on thee. [Exit. Mi. The Kindness which his worth has purchas'd here, Fair words shall not diswade, nor threats deter, I still will Love him, tho' I still despair. [Exit. Jonathan, Eliab, Abishai. Jon. It is not safe within this Court to stay; You stand too much in his wild fury's way. Be warn'd by David's unexpected Fate, And fly to shelter e're it be too late. Eli. To harbour that Opinion of my King, Justly I shou'd my Faith in Question bring: I cannot such a great Injustice dread. Jon. All Justice, Sir, is with your Brother fled, And you, unless you chuse to stay and die, Must to your Country and your Father fly. You shall to Nob this Night and there attend [to Abishai. With my Commands your Cosin and my Friend. Tell him that Saul do's still his hate improve, Yet that grows not so fast as Michol's Love: Tell himâ That tho' he do's an alteration find In his own fate, he shall not in my Mind. Abi. I will, my Lord, all your Commands obey. [bowing. Jon. Farewel, my Friend's, you must no time delay. [Embra. them. A strange infection thro' this Court do's run, Which Wise Men see and seek in time to shun. [Exeunt.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE, Gibeah. Doeg return'd. Do. Fortune I thank thee, thou again art kind, And hast perform'd the mischiefs I design'd. Thou hast restor'd me to my former Day, And blown the Cloud that darkned me, away. The Fav'rite David who eclips'd my light, No longer in the Courts fair Orb do's shine; But tumbled headlong from his sudden height, Rise's not fast as he do's now decline. As Vapours, which the Sun's hot beams exhale With greater hast then they ascended, fall. This blest occasion prudently improv'd, May plant me there whence David was remov'd. Saul and Adriel Enter. Adr. In vain, Great Sir, all your attempts must prove On him whom Israel more than Saul do's Love; His meanest actions gain their best Applause, Who to extol him will find any Cause. He knows his Interest, and on that relies; Nothing abets Rebellion more than this. Each private Man wou'd to a Throne aspire, But want of pow'r restrains his wild desire. Sa. If Israel dares to him, I hate, be kind, Israel, like him, shall my Just Vengeance find. Who Smiles on him, on whom his Sov'reign Frowns, Himself as guilty of Rebellion owns. Do. To love a Man who dares resist his Prince, Is, Sir, an equal Disobedience. Yet some, (who shou'd be still unknown to you, But Duty urges what I grieve to show) Not only entertain your greatest Foes; But arm that hand which do's its King oppose. Sa. Doeg return'd! I thought your Discontent Had sent you to a willful Banishment. Do. To Nob, dread Sir, I had been still confin'd, Had not my Sov'raigns Danger chang'd my Mind. Shou'd I indulge my own Desires, and see You, my Great Lord lost thro' neglect in me. Forbid Just Heav'n who dost these Prayers hear, I shou'd my Life to Saul's content prefer. Adr. Quickly declare the News you hither bring; What is the Danger do's attend the King? Do. When I at Nob but some small time had spent, Pleas'd with the Hopes of Quiet and Content; Report, (to which I meant to stop my Ear;) Fondly inform'd me Jesse's Son was there. Such the applause he caus'd, and such the Joys, Recess cou'd not exempt me from the Noise. The Priest (by whose example all were led) Receiv'd him there, who from your presence fled. Into his Hand he put Goliah's Sword, Arming the Subject to destroy his Lord. When this I knew with my best speed I came, To shew that Doeg can be swift as Fame, When your concerns oblige him to be so. Sa. 'Tis wellâ Nor shall my thanks for thy great hast be slow. That place be thineâ For which thou long and faithfully didst serve, And didst as much as Subject can deserve. That which I did from thee to David give, A Gift he did not Merit to receive. Thou shalt henceforth my Armour-bearer be, Thou best canst Guard, who hast deliver'd me. Now on Abimeleck my Rage must Fall. That Saucy Priestâ Who leads the Ignorant People thus astray, Yet do's pretend to Heav'n to teach the Way, Shall find he err'd who durst his King incense, He was exemplary in the Offence. And it is just; (nor shall his place prevent) He shou'd be made so in the Punishment. [Enter Abner. Abn. A Messenger from Gath, Sir, do's declare, That the Philistin's have renew'd the War: Rallying again their scatter'd Men and Hopes, Tow'rds us they March with Strong and Num'rous Troops. Sa. I will oppose them but must first o'recome A nearer and a greater Foe at home. To Nob this Day I will my Army lead, Punish the Priests and take that David's Head. This done I shall with greater safety go, To meet our old and too presumptuous Foe. [Exeunt. Azuba, Michol. Mi. Sister, too well I by experience know The Greatness of that Grief I blam'd in you. What Ignorance made me doubt too true I find, That love do's more than Blood or Friendship bind. That mean and common Obligation, Blood, Is just as Simples, naturally good, Friendship extracts a Nobler Virtue thence, But purer Love is Friendship's Quintessence. Az. The Love which Nature do's oblige you too, You with a Moderate earnestness pursue; You with your Brother's absence cou'd dispence, But bear your Lovers with Impatience. Not all your Brothers Kindness to his Friend, Can last like yours, nor far as it extend. [Enter Jonathan. Mi. My Brother's hast and looks presage some ill, Must David die? And does Saul hate him still? Jon. Saul's hate encreases as a raging Fire That meets new Fuel when the Wind grows higher. David in vain seeks to avoid his sight, Saul's thoughts o're-take him in his furthest flight, And He will reach him, if at Nob, to Night. Whose sacred Priests must in his Ruine share, For giving him a kind Reception there. All who but smile on him, with him must fall, So Blind and Violent is the Rage in Saul. Mi. Unhappy Man! whose Virtue is his Crime, Whom Saul suspects, only for serving him. Jon. Let us retire and his ill Fate deplore, 'Tis our last Debt, and we can pay no more. My Father has a sudden March design'd, And since for that I no delay can find: I to the Field against my Friend must go, And only can prevent his Ruine so. My Father's projects I must countermine, And save the Man whose loss he do's design: For I my Duty blindly shou'd obey, When it wou'd lead me out of Virtues Way. [Exeunt. SCENE Changes to a Field near Nob. David and Abishai. Da. Welcome my Friend, as welcome as that Rest Thy happy Message brings my troubled Breast. In vain Saul's Rage pursues, when a kind Friend, And kinder Mistress labour to defend. Those double Guards of Friendship and of Love A sure defence against his Arms will prove. Abi. Ev'n happiest Men might envy your worst Fate, Which Beateous Michol do's participate: Her pity, which Saul's Anger do's bestow, Makes full amends for all that drives you to. Da. That Anger now from which I chuse to fly, Is what I might with greater ease defie; I can no danger from the Army Fear, Its greatest part do's to my side adhere: Hither each Day his Murm'ring Subjects Crowd Calling for Vengeance and Redress aloud. To vindicate whose Cause I must engage, Till I can mod'rate or divert his Rage. Lest Grown too Mindful of Saul's violence, They shou'd forget he is their Lawful Prince. Enter a Soulder hastily. Soul. Arm, Arm, my Lord, some Enemy is near; On yonder Hill their Ensigns do appear. This way they March, or rather seem to fly, Like Souldiers led to certain Victory. Da. Let them come on, I can their Arms despise, The brave are ne're o'retook with a Surprize. He who do's every day expose his Breath, Can ne're be said to meet a suddain Death. [Exeunt. SCENE Changes to a Cave. Dorba in it. Dor. While Wars loud Tumults do this Land molest, Peace and soft pleasures only fill my Breast, Saul seeks my Life, yet I, in spite of Saul, Will live and still on my own Spirits call. Here my great Arts I practice with Success, And slight that Rage which wou'd those Arts suppress: He do's in vain to take my Life intend, Which Pow'rful Charms, like Bulwarks, do defend: But Tolo is return'dâ [Enter Spirit flying: Say gentle Spirit, say my Faithful Spy, What didst thou in thy flight to Nob descry? Inform me all and sooth my Soul with Joy To know how Israel do's it self destroy. Tol. Tow'rds Nob with nimble Wings I cut the Air, When angry Saul with me just enter'd there. Thirst of Revenge had so encreast his hast, That I, tho' Born on Winds, scarce flew more fast. His lighter Horse had reacht with him the Place, His foot from Gibeah mov'd a flower pace. Yet e're to Night will end their March with him, Their hast makes the short Journey shorter seem. Hence tow'rd the Desert as I turn'd my Eye, There I saw David and his Army lie, Fearful to stay and doubtful where to fly. When lo from Gath-ward the Philistin Host Enrag'd tow'rd Saul, as he to Nob, did post. But leaving them to pitch their Camp, and Saul, Just ready on the trembling Priests to fall, I came to bear this Message and to know What Mighty Dorba will Command me now. Dor. The Priests of Nob did first conspire my Fall, And made my Sentence be pronounc'd by Saul; To shun whose Fury, prompted by my Fear, I chose to seek a timely refuge here: Where, tho' from all the Dread of Danger freed, I still remember what they had decreed. And to insult o're their ill Fate must see The manner of their long-wish'd Tragedy. Remove all objects hence which interpose, And streight the Scene of Blood and Death disclose: 'Twill be a grateful prospect to my Eyes To see those Priests thus made a Sacrifice. The Spirit goes out. The SCENE discovers a Temple, in it an Altar at distance: The High-Priest and other Priests about it. Saul, Doeg and others enter; he seems to talk with the Priests; they bow often; at last Saul gives a sign to Doeg, who falls on the High-Priest and his Guards kill the other Priests and go out. In the midst of the Show the Spirit enters; which being past, Dorba says. Dor. Enough, thou hast perform'd thy Duty well, The Entertainment was acceptable. The Temple-SCENE Vanishes. Dor. Let us to our more private Cell withdraw, And there conspire New illsâ More black and horrid than what here we saw. They go out of the Cave and the SCENE changes to a Field. David, Eliab, Abishai. Da. Thus are the Storms you rais'd, by you o'reblown, You, whom we must our great Defenders own. Your coming brings the Fears it caus'd Relief, And makes our Joy excessive as our Grief. Eli. Your Danger, not my Pow'r has brought this aid, Your Friends for you, more than themselves afraid. Lest your unguarded Virtue shou'd be lost, Have to their Hazards all their Lives expos'd. Da. Their Kindness do's beyond my Virtue go, I cou'd not hope what they vouchsafe to do; Who leave a strong and potent side, to be Dependants on my weaker Arms and me. Eli. Brother, discreetly to your Arms they trust, Which must be strong because your War is just. All you design is in your own defence, Which to neglect wou'd wrong your Innocence. Yet, tho' unjustly Saul your Life pursues, They who wou'd guard it, theirs are doom'd to lose. Nob's Eighty Priests must perish by his Sword, For the Relief they did to you afford. Da. How! die for me! that Saul had took this Head, E're so much Blood to save it had been shed: O! that this wretched Life had first been lost! It is not worth the mighty Price it Cost. Ab. In vain, my Lord, you do their Death lament, While you shou'd seek a greater to prevent. The furious King in his pursuit is near, The Sun will stay to show his Army here. Da. That Life, Abishai, which he longs to take, Is what I wou'd as willingly forsake: Yet since to you his Rage alike extends, I must endeavour to preserve my Friends. But if my Blood his Anger can attone, To save a Thousand Lives, who wou'd not lay down one? Eli. He must not at so cheap a rate be lost Who the vast Summ of Lives, like you, has cost. We, by opposing, shall avoid his hate, Who dares be Valiant must be Fortunate. Da. Brother, that Price which on my Life you set, Is that which only makes me value it, And I will save itâbut by speedy flight, I only stay to see the Prince this Night. And when from him I know his Fathers Mind, I thus will frustrate what he has design'd. For, did I stay to meet Saul, I shou'd seem To all the World as guilty as to him. [Exeunut. Saul, Jonathan, Adriel, Abner, Doeg, Guards. Sa. Declare how near the Rebel Army lies. Do. Only that Wood conceals them from your Eyes: You have long since within their prospect been. Sa. They think themselves secure because unseen; But they shall find that Saul has piercing Eyes, And feel that Pow'r which now they dare despise. Here let our Camp be pitch'dâ This one Nights rest will fit our Men to do The Work to Morrows Sun will lead them to. [Exeunt. Several great Clouds appear, the Moon partly seen; from behind one of them, Enter David and Abishai. Da. Night hastens on, and with its darkest Clouds, From Mortal Eyes the Heav'ns bright surface shrouds. The Guilty now secure may quit his Cell, And practise all his Arts invisible. Then sure our Innocence and this Disguise May lead us safe thro' sleeping Enemies, Which might deceive ev'n the most watchful Eyes. Abi. The Souldiers weary'd with their March to Day, Will now their Greater Leader, sleep, obey. And give us time sufficient to descry What strength they have, and how incamp'd they lie. Da. A greater Influence draws my Heart that way, A Friendship, whose Commands I must obey: The Prince is there, from whom I must receive A Happiness which only he can give. But we lose time in talking; let us go, And like the falling Dew, be still and flow. [Exeunt. Thro' a Dark SCENE several lights are discover'd, at distance. Enter David and Abishai. Abi. Those Fires will to the Camp direct our Way, Having such Guides, we cannot go astray. The Camp discover'd. At distance thro' Rows of Tents Saul is seen sleep-in his Pavilion; the Guards scatter'd on the Ground asleep, a fire by Saul's Tent. Enter David and Abishai. Da. A Sleep, like Death, has all the Guards possest, Can one Days March require so great a Rest? Regardless of their Duty, or their Foe, They grant that favour we wou'd have them show. Yet I in vain have sought the Prince; I Fear He is with Saul, but more he is not here. Abi. See, Sir, some great Commander sure lies there, So Rich his Arms, so strong his Guards appear. [Sees Saul. Da. Ha! is it Saul? or do my Eyes mistake? Can he be there and not his Guards awake? Tho' for themselves no better Watch they keep, The King's Concern shou'd banish thoughts of sleep. Abi. Propitious Heav'n do's smile and gives you Pow'r To end your Fear and Enemies Life this Hour. Embrace the Favour it is pleas'd to give, Which if delay'd you never can retrieve. Da. Do you perswade what I must blush to hear? Or has Saul's sleep o'recome, like him, your Fear? That to contract this Guilt you dare provide, A Guilt those Clouds wou'd be too thin to hide. The sleeping Lion fears no violence, And needs no Guards: his Pow'r is his Defence. Beasts to their King such true Allegiance show, Yet Men dare Act what they refuse to do. Abi. He is a Tyrant, and to punish him, Wou'd be a Merit rather than a Crime. Da. A giddy Rout did first that Name invent Thro' their Dislike to Kingly Government. And to subvert what they were griev'd to see, Call'd sacred Empire Cruel Tyranny. But let us our Discourses nearer bring; Grant Saul a Tyrant, yet he is a King: And tho' a wicked Monarch's Blood is spilt, His Crimes can ne're excuse his Murderer's guilt. Yet who dares censure what his King has done? Who since, save Heav'n, he do's depend on none, Can be accountable to that alone. Forbear Abishai to advise a deed So illâ That this advice do's long Repentance need. Abi. O most unequall'd Virtue! thus to be Its Foes best Friend, its own worst Enemy. Da. Sir, you mistakeâ By sparing him whom you will call my Foe, I give him thus a greater Overthrow: Tho' by his Rage I was condem'd to fall, Thus I shall triumph o're that Rage and Saul. Yet I will take his Sword, that he may know, I shun'd the Mischief I had Pow'r to do. [He takes Saul's Sword from his side. He do's deserve the Name of Just alone, Who flies ill Deeds when easie to be done. [Exeunt. An Alarm. Enter Abner at another Door in hast; he strikes the sleeping Guards, who Rise. Abn. Dull slothful Souls; is this the Watch you keep? When dangers wake can you have time to sleep? Awake, Sir, Rise and straight in Arms appear, [To Saul who starts. A greater Foe than you suspect is near. Sa. Ha! speak, what Foe? how near us can he be? Abn. It is your old Philistin Enemy; Who, to Revenge their last great Overthrow, With all their Force are Marching tow'rds you now. My Scouts descry'd them on the Neighbr'ing Hills. The News our Men with strange Confusion fills. Sa. The greatest trouble I from them receive [Aside. Is that their hast gains David time to live. I from pursuit must to defence be gone, Nor seek his Life till I secure my own. For when the greatest Danger I suppress, I, at my leisure, may o'recome the less. Let them come on; we can their force withstand, I slight their Arms while this is in my Hand. [He looks for his Sword, and missing it starts. Ha! my Sword gone! this Omen brings some Fear: Who took it hence? speak Traitors, who was here? [To the Guards: Abn. Pardon me, Sir, if I declare my guess, That it was none besides the Son of Jess. Sa. say from what Reason do's that thought proceed? Abn. I judge it from the Greatness of the Deed. For none can boast so brave a Soul as he, When he cou'd kill, to spare an Enemy. Besides he little difficulty found; For when I enter'dâ The sluggish Guards lay snoaring on the Ground. Sleep on their Eye-lids did so heavy sit, That they have hardly got them open yet. Sa. Villains!â Who for your King no better watches keep, Whom your Concerns too often rob of sleep. Enter Jonathan with Saul's Sword. Jon. I have a Message, Sir from Jesse's Son. Sa. This may resolve my doubts when told,âgo on. Jon. A Scout of mine drawn home by these Alarms, Met near the Camp two Men disguis'd in Arms; Who knowing him first call'd him by his Name, And having ask'd his News and whence he came; David (whom by his Voice before he knew,) Gave him this Sword, a Present Sir, for you. Thro' all your Guards, he too it from your side, Yet did your Death, which some advis'd, forbid. Shall this brave Man be thought a Rebel still? Will you, Sir, him who shun'd your Murder, kill? [Saul pauses a while, and then saysâ Sa. No, now alas! I shou'd appear unjust, If since this proof I shou'd his Faith distrust. By this last Action it is evident, He was not guilty; or do's now repent. Go Jonathan, invite him to return; Tell him I now for his hard usage Mourn: Use all your Interest and you cannot fail. Jon. Sir, I will goâbut mean not to prevail. [Aside. Sa. Thus subtilty shall with much ease obtain, [Exit. What publick Force has oft assay'd in vain: I now shall have him in my reach again. Saving my Life shall not excuse his Crime; I wou'd not live if not to punish him. I'le speak him fair, and with dissembling Art, Smile in his Face, then stab him to the Heart. [Exeunt. SCENE changes to a Wood. David, Eliab, Abishai. Eli. Since the Philistin Army is so near, It will divert Saul's Anger and our Fear. He must defer his hot pursuit of you, To meet a more considerable Foe. Da. My trouble is not for my self, but Saul, When loud Alarms to threatning Dangers call. He was secure while he but follow'd me, He chas'd a loyal Friend, no Enemy. But now he with a deadly Foe must joyn, Who seeks his Ruine more than he do's mine. Yet if he will receive my poor supplies, My Life's expence shall save the loss of his. Abi. This Point of Honour leads you, Sir, too far, For your pursuer to maintain a War! No such great proof of Virtue needs be shown, To save his Life by hazzarding your own. Da. Nothing perform'd with ease is counted great, Men purchase Fame with Danger and with Sweat. Two Souldiers enter with Jonathan in disguise. Soul. This Man, my Lord, was taken near your Tent, He says he from the Prince to you is sent. We judge he is one of the Enemies spyes. [David views him. Da. 'Tis heâI know him thro' the strange Disguise. [Runs and Embraces him. Da. In vain, Sir, this Concealment you design'd; Friendship can see where all things else are blind. Jon. I chose this way, least coming with a Guard, Might make my presence by your People fear'd. Who by mistaking me for Jealous Saul, Might blindly to some Inconvenience Fall. For I am come the Messenger of Peace: Your last brave Act has made Saul's Anger cease. Pleas'd with a Deed so far from Counterfeit, He to his Camp do's you and these invite. Da. Thanks, my dear Lord, no blessing e're cou'd be Besides your sight, so great as this to me. Jon. Hold Friend, too much you do that Blessing prize, My Father's Kindness is but meer Disguise. He soon will throw away those shews of Love, When he his Foes and Danger can remove. Till then his Looks are pleasant and serene, But all his Clouds will soon return again. Here in the Camp 'tis insecure to stay, You shall to Court, it is your safest way. Da. Must I unarm'd, and from all Danger far, Behold my King and Friend engag'd in War? O do not Sir, so hard a Task injoyn; Your thoughts sure cannot differ thus from mine. Jon. Dispute no more you must to Gibeah go, For Saul permits, and I command you so. There for your self you must a Courtier be, A Husband and a Comforter for me. Nor can your help be so important here, Who serve your Friend and see your Mistress there. Da. I can no longer your Commands dispute, Thus yours my weaker Reason do's confute? Now a Denial can have no pretence, Since Love and Friendship call for my Defence. Jon. This Day we March to meet the Enemy, Let your dispatch as quick to Gibeah be. The time hasts on too fastâand we must part, You leave my Body here, but take my Heart. Wish us success as great as that you brought, When you for Honour and our Safety fought. Da. Where're you are all happiness must be, Since in your self you take it all from me. [They Embrace and go out severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE, a Mountain near the Camp. Saul and Doeg in disguise. Do, Beneath this Mountain Dorba's Cave do's lie, As low its bottom, as its Top is high. Dark as the Arts she studies in it are, And dismal as the Fiends she raises there. Which (by her Pow'r) at her Command are sent To Breed confusion in each Element. Now thro' the Land they scatter Discord's Seed; Now strange Diseases and Contagions breed: Now they rejoice to see the Ocean rave, And threaten Ruine with its ev'ry Wave; And now from these up to the Air they fly, Where Infant Thunders wrapt in Clouds do lie; Then break its Secundine, and give it Birth, To blast the Fields and make a Barren Earth. Sa. But do's her Pow'r to raise the Dead extend? Can she with all her Charms make them ascend? And then unfold the dark Results of Fate, And future Progress of a troubled State? Do. Name but what Ghost you please, it shall appear, Strait to that form she will condense the Air. And in it her Familiar Spirit wrap, To solve your doubts from the Phantastick Shape. It shall declare yours and your Kingdoms doom, And, as if present, show you things to come: It the Remotest Actions can descry, Time cannot reach beyond its piercing Eye. This, Sir, I by experience can declare. At Nob I was foretold my Fate by her. That David shou'd, like me, be in disgrace, And I regain your Favour and his Place. But since you did that fatal Sentence give, That not a Witch shou'd in your Israel live, She will to none, but privately, impart, The strange effects of her Mysterious Art. Sa. Sure this disguise my Person may conceal; But if her Magick Art do's that reveal, Rewards shall force her to declare my doom, For Gold has Charms, which will ev'n hers or'ecome. [Exeunt. The Cave discover'd, in it Dorba asleep, some Spirits, hov'ring over her, who sing.â SONG. 1. Sp. Sleep, sleep unconcern'd and enjoy a free Rest, Take all Light from her Eyes, and all Care from her Breast. 2. Sp. 'Tis done, they are gone, They no longer cou'd stay. 3. Sp. I see them, I see them all posting away. Cho. When pleasures approach, grief is still put to flight, So the Sun at his Rise Reguilding the Skies Dispenses the Clouds that had darkned his Light. Tolo enters and touching Dorba with his Wand wakens her. To. Awake, awake, for Saul is near, But yet admit no thought of Fear, He must the help of Art implore, And court what he condemn'd before. He comes conceal'd in borrow'd shape, That thus he may your Knowledge 'scape. Do. How can he hope he shou'd delude my Eyes, With the vain helps of Night and a Disguse? So Ignorant is Man, who do's believe And trust those Arts he thinks he can deceive. To. He comesâ Dor. âBegone my Spirit and unseen, Reprove his Folly and Conduct him in. Exit Tolo. A hollow Noise and Flashes of Fire, the Spirit flies in, after it Saul and Doeg. Tolo sings behind the SCENE. SONG. To. While the hidden Decrees of Fate you wou'd know You but hasten your Sorrow and Double your Wo; Foreseeing the pains you must bear, You antedate all with your Fear: Then why shou'd you seek to discover that doom, Which too soon you will know, when its time is to come. Sa. Woman, arise, thy mighty Art declare, [to Dorba. And make the Ghost, which I wou'd see, appear. Do. Forbear my Son thus to design my death, [she rises. Time soon will waste my little Stock of Breath. I must (the Day draws near when Fate will call) Resign my hated Life to that and Saul. Sa. Let this reward thy pains; and do not Fear, [Gives her Money. No hurt from Saul shall ever reach thee here. Dor. Say, in what form I shall the Vision make? Sa. Let it no form, but of old Samuel take. Dor. Why thus do's Saul lay Wait for wretched me? Too well, alas! I know that thou art he. Sa. Suspend thy Fear, let my Wish receive, Saul Seals thy Pardon: then go on and live. [Dorba shakes her Wand. Dor. Thou who art ready still at hand, To exercise what I command: Tolo, the Gentlest of thy kind, Nimble as Thought, and light as Wind, VVho canst thy very Limbs disguise In Thousand Shapes to cheat Mens Eyes: Who with a Smooth, or Wrinkled Brow, A nimble Motion or a Slow, Canst Young and Old by Turns appear, And fill the Mind with Hope or Fear, Into Fate's deep designs canst look, And search the Adamantine Book, Rise and old Samuel's Shape assume, And to the King declare his doom. The Ground opens, and the Ghost ascends like an old Man Mantled. Gho. Why hast thou brought me from my Rest below, To tell thee what thou shou'dst abhor to know? Searching to read thy Fortune bad or good, I found it writ in Characters of Blood: Thy Fall is near, to Morrow is the Day Must take thy Scepter and thy Life away, Thy Host and Off-spring; and when thou art gone, The Son of Jess shall fill thy empty Throne. Farewell to Morrow thou shalt visit me, And then, as I, an airy form shalt be. [The Ghost sinks. Sa. And then damn'd Ghost I'le be reveng'd on thee. Come since one short Day more must be my last Let us to Battel and to Death make hast: I will not Covet to prolong its date, He doubly suffers who expects his Fate. [Exeunt Saul and Doeg. Dor. Go, hast to ruine, and prevent thy Foe, While I am feasted with thy overthrow. But least it shou'd too longâ [Enter Tolo. To that desir'd and happy Day appear, Let my Diversion be, till then, your Care. Tolo beckens in the four Spirits, who sing. SONG. 1. Sp. We are bound as her Slaves her Commands to fulfil, To attend on her Pleasure and wait on her Will. 3. Sp. We come and we go We run and we fly. 2. Sp. Thro' earth and thro' water, thro' fire and thro' sky. Chor. Then let us some pleasant diversion invent To afford her delight And to pass the long Night Which in troubles and fears must by others be spent. The SONG ended, they Dance; and the Dance being done, Dor. Now bear me gently henceâ And thro' the yeilding Air's wide Region fly, That I may see and triumph in his Misery. The Spirits cause a Cloud to descend, in which the Witch being plac'd, they bear her away in it, and the SCENE changes to the Camp. Jonathan, Adriel, Abner. Jon. The Sun appears thro' the dark Mask of Night, And Clouds, like Spirits, fly before the Light. The Day is come which must bring Israel peace, Or make the Miseries she bears encrease. Abn. Her Foes, who long with ill Success have fought, Now desperate to their last Refuge brought, Join all their Force, resolv'd this once to try For certain Death or certain Victory. Adr. Our Men in their dejected Looks express, A strange distrust of their own Courages. Heedless in Duty, and to Action slow, I Fear the Omen do's some ill foreshow. Jon. I cannot entertain a Thought of Fear, Yet in each look I read some danger near. Tow'rds the last Watch, as on my Couch I lay, I heard a hollow Voice, cry, Come away. Starting I cast my Watchful Eyes about, When, lo! the Torch turn'd Blue and almost out. Yet, led my Eye tow'rds the Tent-door to see, A thing Clad all in White which beckn'd me. As of its Face I took a serious View, The Features and the Lineaments I knew, They were the same with hers, who gave me Breath, And who now Rests among the Shades beneath. While on the Object I was thus intent, Silent as falling Snow away it went. And beck'ning at each step, twice more did say, What it before had utter'd, Come away. [Enter Saul. Abn. See, Sir, the King, he seems disturb'dâ Jon. âAlas! I read despair and Horrour in his Face. Sure something of to Day's events he knows, Something more dreadful than he can disclose. Sa. Why do you gaze at me with all this dread, Is it my Crown you stare at, or my Head? Both still are mine, and I your Monarch still, Nor David yet my empty Throne do's fill. Jon. His Cares distract him, and divert his Fear [Aside. To things remote, from certain dangers near. Unhappy Empire! as a Curse from Heav'n, [Saul walks about. To him who rules, and them who sought it, giv'n. Since all his Subjects, who are good and just, Either incur his hatred or distrust. His Fear alone from David's Virtue Springs, He thinks none Merit, but who wou'd be Kings. Who do's not Virtue for its self regard, Nor know how well it self it do's reward. Sa. Go, see the Chariots in due order plac'd, [To Jonathan. You to the Horse, you to the Foot make hast. [To Adr. and Abn. My self soon in the Army's head will be, And lead them on to Death or Victory. [Eexunt. The Trumpets Sound a Charge, and great shouts are made, which being awhile continu'd, Enter Saul and Doeg meeting him. Do. Hast, Sir, the Foe has almost won the Field, Your Ranks are broke, your heartless Souldiers yield. Some Court their Enemies Swords, which others fly, But all who dare oppose their Fury die. Sa. Lead me among the thickest of my Foes, Of my short time, I will no minute lose: But since my Life is made the Aim of Fate, I will not sell it at an under-rate. [Exeunt Adriel enters, wounded, and pursu'd by Philistins. SCENE a Field. Adr. In vain I have their numerous Swords withstood, Come on, come on, and glut your selves with Blood. He falls, they go out dragging him off. Several Israelites pursu'd by Philistins cross the Stage. Then enter Saul and Doeg. SCENE a Desart. Sa. What Man cou'd do, I have already done, To purchase Israel's safety and my own: Oppress'd with Numbers I was forc'd to fly, Content to gain this little time to die. For that is all I have now left to do, And I for that must be oblig'd to you. If by Philistin's Arms I shou'd be slain, The way of dying wou'd exceed the Pain. Do. Forbid, good Heav'n, that I shou'd kill my Lord! First let my Blood stain some Philistins Sword. Sa. Since then you will not with my Wish comply, Thus to my self I grant what you deny. No hand but Saul's shall Act his Tragedy. [He falls. Do. Thus a stern Lyon braves his numerous Foes, Till finding Courage do's in vain oppose, Too weak to stand and yet too brave to fly He makes a fair Retreatâ Not to shun Death, but undiscern'd to die. Sa. I go, I go to an Eternal Rest, Which thoughts of Empire never shall molest, Nor shalt thou David trouble there my Breast. The pow'r, thou didst aspire to, I resign, I cannot wish a greater Mischief thine. May'st thou the envy'd Crown of Israel wear, And with it all its vast unenvy'd Care. I quit it freely, that it may to thee Prove the same Curse, which it has done to me. [Dies. Do. Since Saul is Dead, in vain I wish to live, I only shou'd to greater woes survive. But I will David's Vengeance thus prevent. And free my self from fear and punishment. [He falls on his own sword. Enter an Amalekite. Ama. I saw the vanquish'd King retire this way, Weak with the Toil and Trouble of the Day, By fate oppos'd, to all his Foes a Prey. See where he lies! by his own Sword o'rethrown, None else wou'd take his Life and Leave his Crown: That is reserv'd to further my Address, And gain me Favour with the Son of Jess: To him I will the Sacred Present bring, And to endear it, say, I kill'd the King. This happy Service he will sure reward, And Love the Hand, by which he is preferr'd. For Jonathan is dying, or now dead, He this way from the Battel wounded fled, To find his Father; but is gone astray, Or dy'd to meet him in another way. [Exit. Enter Jonathan bleeding. Jon. My Wounds bleed fast, my strength as fast decays, And Death is entring at these several Ways: Yet that a mean and common Refuge is, To which poor Spirits fly from Miseries. But I to greatest Troubles wou'd survive: The truely Noble dare unhappy live. They can the Injuries of Fate despise, And when they're most deprest do highest rise. But see! my Father bleeding on the Ground! [Starts seeing Saul. These are but small, That is my greatest Wound, So kind a Father and a King so good, Requires a double Debt of Tears and Blood. [Weeps. But he is slain, and I mispend my Grief, The Dead in Sighs and Tears find no Relief. I will embrace what Heav'n for him decreed, And rather to his Death, than Throne Succeeds One more deserving must that pow'r enjoy, Which want of Merit did in us destroy. For, tho' without it Men may Crowns obtain, Desert alone confers a long-liv'd Reign. May his be such and may the Crown he wears Yeild all its Joys untainted with its Cares: Wou'd Heav'n but grant it, I cou'd wish to breath To see my Friend enjoy what I bequeath. But 'tis deny'dâ Death cou'd not grieve me any other way, Than closing thus my Eyes before that Day. [Dies. Enter several Philistins. 1. Phi. Here, here they are by their own fears destroy'd, Yet dead, they shall not our Revenge avoid. Convey their Bodies hence and hang them high, The Noblest Trophies of our Victory. [They go out with the Dead Bodies: Enter Abner and Officer. SCENE a Field. Abn. In vain we longer do withstand our Foes, Israel has lost all she had left to lose. For mighty Saul and Jonathan are dead, Those Pillars fall'n, she must decline her Head. Only in David all her hopes remain, His Virtue may her Liberty regain. Let us to him, as to her Champion, go, Tho' he was ours, he was not Israel's Foe, Nor was he ours, but that we made him so. Offic. When he appear'd against our Enemies, Still their success bow'd and gave place to his. As Rubbish, which some shallow Stream withstood, Yields to the stronger Violence of a Flood. Abn. Let us to Gibeah hast; while he is there, We are beyond the reach of Foes or Fear: And tho' our Swords were drawn for Saul, not him, We by confessing shall excuse our Crime. Brave Souls, like his, believe no fault so great, Which true submission cannot expiate. [Exeunt. Merab with a Letter in her Hand. SCENE Gibeah. Mer. David is come to see a Mistress here, But he shall find the short liv'd pleasure dear. The Death he shunn'd from my great Fathers hand Shall overtake him now by his Command. Here's my Commissionâ To which I will a quick Obedience show, Saul never pleas'd me with Commands till now. [Exit. David. Michol in her Chamber. Da. To the wild rage of War I owe my Peace, For only that cou'd make my Troubles cease; Divert your Father's anger and allow This happy leisure of attending you: For, tho' my Life was from his Pow'r secure, I did a greater loss in you endure. Mi. You cou'd not more condemn Saul's cruelty, Nor be a greater Sufferer than I. Your Safety and your Dangers still were mine, With you I rise and did with you decline. Da. So Lutes tun'd by some skilful hand alike Do both seem Sufferers, tho' but one you strike. For each soft touch its fellow do's receive, This will its thanks in pleasing Accents give. But if some ruder Hands disturbs the Strings, Trembles and grieves in loud harsh Murmurings. Mi. In vain they sep'rate us, whose Souls are joyin'd, For they are free and cannot be confin'd. They, uncontroul'd, no bounds nor distance know, But spite of all to their lov'd Objects go: As streams their passage to the Ocean force, While Men in vain wou'd intercept their Course. Enter Azuba. Azub. Pardon that I intrude on your Recess, [To Michol. To share what you, unkind, alone possess: For I some Interest in him can pretend, Both as your Lover and my Husbands Friend. Da. The Justice of your Claim, I must confess, So much in that consists my happiness, For I am blest that you vouchsafe to own The poor Address of my Devotion. Azub. To shew how I prize Services from you, I am come hither to employ you now. You to my Lodging shall with me repaire, A slender Banquet waits your Presence there. Nor cou'd I spare this Leisure from my Grief, But that your coming brings it some Relief. Da. When such Commands you on your Servant lay As he wou'd chuse, he cannot disobey. [Exeunt. Several Shouts without; some running over the Stage cry, Long live King David. Enter David at one door, Abishai and the Amalekite at the other. Da. What impious Shouts are those that grate my Ear? Have the mad Crowds lost all their sense of Fear? That thus they dare from their Allegiance fall, And own a King in Israel not Saul? Abi. The ground, my Lord, of all these Clamours springs From news, which this Amalekite now brings. Amal. Saul too unworthy of that mighty Name Will now to Israel lay no further Claim. The Crown his head dishonour'd, as your due [Presents the Crown kneeling. Great Sir, I humbly do present to you. This Hand attain'd the Happiness this Day, [David seems much mov'd. To take Saul's Life and then his Crown away: Which, since the King and Jonathan are dead, Is a fit Present only for your Head. Da. How! Kill a King and Glory in the Act! And to that ill a greater Sin contract! Nay, void of all humanity and Shame, Dar'st play the Trait'rous Murd'rer with his Fame. O banish'd Virtue! whither art thou gone? When Men thus boast, what they shou'd blush to own! Amal. It was by his Command I fell on him: Da. Ev'n that Obedience aggravates the Crime. When Kings Command what is not fit to do, In disobeying we obedience show. Go kill him, sacrifice his Life to Saul, [To Abishai who kills him. That single death is punishment too small For him, who having shed his Sov'raigns blood Wou'd blast his Name to make the Action good. Abi. I must obey, tho' I believe I err, Liking the News to kill the Messenger. Da. Thus may they fallâ Who dare mean things of Kingly pow'r conceive, And slight Heav'ns greatest Representative. But I too much for Saul alone complain: Did he not tell me Jonathan was slain? Oh Noble Princeâ The slow expressions of my Grief forgive, I cou'd not, what I so abhorr'd, believe. Nor shew my Sorrow, which is grown for thee, Unutterable as thy Love for me. Tho' I, like Women, cou'd command my Eyes, Their true and feign'd Complaints wou'd not suffice: Their grief to mine wou'd as inferior prove, As their mean Flame to thy Sublimer Love. Enter Eliab hastily. Eli. My Lord, your Grief you must a while defer, And from a Mourner turn a Comforter: Your Princess lost in Horrour and Despair, With Garments torn and wildly scatter'd Hair, Like one distracted thro' the Palace flies, Making each Room eccho her Mournful Cries: Kind Azuba hearing her Husbands Fate Sank trembling from the Couch on which she sate. Whose Maids all strive to raise her up in vain, She lies still sensless of her Grief or Pain. But haughty Merab at the sad Allarm (Whom Pride against all sense of Fear did Arm) Leap'd from the Terrace to the Inner-Court, And thus expir'd, our Grief and Fortune's Sport. This strange design did from her Guilt proceed, The Circumstances you in this may read. [Gives a Letter. Da. Tho' she alive no Pity Merited, She do's command it now by being Dead. Tho' we the bad amidst their greatness hate, We shou'd lament them when Unfortunate. But we forget the Princessâ [David is going. Enter Abner with Officers, he goes in hast to meet David, and kneeling, lays his Sword at his Feet. Abn. Extend, great Sir, your mercy to a Foe, Whom only his Allegiance render'd so: Had Saul still liv'd, I must have sought your Death, But my Aversion ended with his Breath: And I to you as Israel's Champion fly, Since all her hopes do on your Sword rely. Da. Rise generous Sir,â Whate're you did commanded by your King Requires not the Submission which you bring. Your due Obedience I my self Commend, None can in height of Loyalty offend. I much esteem the Present which you give, Yet wou'd quit all that Saul and Noble Jonathan might live. The troubles which the loss of them do's breed, Out weigh the Benefits which thence proceed. Abn. With too much Grief, Sir, you their loss deplore, The sinking Empire wants your pity more: And Courts your Hand in this great exigence, As only fit to fight in her defence. The scatter'd Souldiers Rally and Renew Their wonted Courage from their hopes of you. No General, no King but you they own, What Valour can they better trustâ Than that, whose great effects they have already known? Da. Being then invested in this mighty Trust, I will to Israel and to Saul be just: I will with speed against their Enemy go, And Suffer, or Revenge their Overthrow. But all the Punishment their Foes can bear, Cannot the loss of Jonathan repair. O Glorious Friend! if thy Pure Soul can see The World and what thou once didst favour, me! From the bright Seat which now thou fillst look down, And see with what Regret I wear thy Crown. And if thou canst amidst the Joys above Admit the Duties of a Mortal Love, Behold my Sorrow, and the Tears I shed, Unhappy I! who live when thou art dead. Yet, since it must be soâ The greatest Pleasure of my Life shall be To take a full and just revenge for thee; Till ev'n thy foes at their Success repine, And pay whole Seas of Blood for every drop of thine. [Exeunt Omnes: FINIS.</field>
