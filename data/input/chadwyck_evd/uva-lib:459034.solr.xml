      <field name="fulltext">THE OBSTINATE LADY A COMEDY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Come Reader draw thy purse and be a guest To our Parnassus; Tis the Muses feast The entertainment needs must be divine; Appollo's th'Host where Cockains Heads ye Sign</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE AUTHORS APOLOGY TO THE READER. These poor trifles (courteous Reader) had not now become so troublesome to the World, if it had been in my power to have prevented them: for at my going once out of London, I left them with a friend of mine, who dying, they were dispersed into divers hands. Mr. William Godbid got my Obstinate Lady, and though he found it with the last leaf torn out, wherein my conclusion to the play with the Epilogue were; he procured some acquaintance of his to supply the defect at the end, and so Printed it. And though that Comedy, be very much of it writ in number, he put it forth as if the most part of it were prose. Here you have that defect much amended, and my own conclusion and Epilogue added. I was fearful my Trappolin, and other Poems should have run the like misfortune; and therefore made a diligent enquiry after them, and when I had found them out could not get them delivered without parting with some money, and promising my honest friend Mr. W. Godbid, (after I had afforded them some small correction) I would bestow them on him, (with my consent) for the Press: For indeed without his (assistance) I should not have recovered them out of a Gentlemans hands whom I will forbear to name. I hope there is nothing in the whole so amorous as to arrive at impiety, yet nevertheless could I have imagined them worthy the trouble of transcription, you will find many things here that had been omitted. After this general Apologie I must also make my excuse for some particular pieces. I have been demanded by some Persons of Quality and judgement, why in my copy of Verses before Mr. Fletchers volume of Plaies, I chiefly reflect upon the Mad, Lover, my noble friend and kinsman Mr. Charles Cotton, sent me that single Play in a Manuscript, which I had divers years in my hands: therefore when I found the Players were prohibited to act, I writ those poor Verses with an intention to have had the Mad Lover printed single, and them to have waited on it; (which when the large Volume came forth) my Cosin Cotton commanded from me, and gave the Printers. Next, I must acknowledge I have been merry with Mr. James Strong and his pretty Pamphlet. But seeing many thus make as bold with him, I presumed I might take the same liberty. I must only request the chastwomen of Lin, to take no offence at these Verses, I intended them none; if there be any of dissolute life in that town, let those be accounted of as his Joanes and no other: I hope James Strong is of Coriats gentle disposition, and will endure jesting with, otherwise (at his leisure) he hath my leave to be as pleasant with me. Some few things that I translated out of Latin and Italian, I have not inserted, as accounting them too wanton to breath in this chaster clime: and in truth if any body (either through curiosity, or by any other accident) should english any such pieces, it will be esteemed a discretion in them to forbear publishing them. Lastly, I have made some progress into a Play, to be called the Tragedy of Ovid, which (if my Obstinate Lady, and Trappolin take) I may be encouraged to perfect, and present to you hereafter, with some other things that are not yet put into method, fit for the Press, if you be not cloid with these small Poems already, and hate a farther surfeit upon such toyes: If this book hath the fortune to attain to a second impression, you may then hear farther from me: and in the mean while this is enough from Your servant ASTON COKAIN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS NOBLE FRIEND Sir ASTON COKAIN on his Poetical composures. Sir, though I cannot on such praises hit, As well may suit the wardrobe of your wit, Rich and repleat; yet give me leave to aim, And light my Taper at your Delphick flame. But how should such a dazeled sence as mine, (Lost in high-waies of Excellence divine) See to pass judgements on your lines aright, That seem all gilded with PhoebÃ¦an light From your rich brain effus'd, that to the skie Rightly conformes in clear sublimity? I almost should have thought your nimbler soul Had fire from Heaven, like fly Prometheus, stole; But that whereas accursed plagues he brought, Wherewith Pandora's box was sadly fraught, You with choice things have blest us, such as be Treasures of wit, art, language, history. How strangely winds your fancy here and there! Like to your Anchor, built with streams more clear That glide along as if they long'd to see Themselves ingulft in vast eternity. Surely you drew from noble birds of Po Those numerous sweetnesses that ravisht so; And from rich Naples and renowned Rome Brought forth fine courtship and choice learning home. Your Muse (impregnate with no common worth) Thus travail'd for a fame, and brought it forth: Whose issue he that envies, let him hear (Like Phrygian Midas) with a lengthn'd eare Nothing but scornes shot at him sundry waies, Yet take those pellets for a charge of praise. Kick at such currish slaves, nor think them fit To pick up at your chair the crumbs of wit; But think, whilst other Muses seem to dance After your measures, they your praise advance. Needs must those wits or harsh or heavy be, That move not at your strokes of harmony. Tho. Bancroft.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Brave crown of Gallants welcome! May this place Meet expectation; you afford us grace: We joy that such a multitude divine Of Planets in our little Spheres do shine; And that besides our Horizon is stuck With lesser lights, we do esteem't good luck. For the great favour, may each several scene Affect you more, then Hebe's Nectar Heaven: We can but wish't: for if y'are come to day In expectation of a faultless play, Writ by learn'd Johnson, or some able pen, Fam'd, and approv'd of by the world, you then We disappoint: our Poet had never yet Hisses condemn, or hands commend his wit. Troth, Gentlemen, we know that now a daies Some come to take up wenches at our plaies; It is not our designe to please their sence, We wish they may go discontented hence. And many Gallants hither come (we think) To sleep, and to digest their too much drink: We may please them; for we will not molest, With drums or trumpets, any of their rest. If perfum'd wantons do for eighteen pence, Expect an Angel, and alone go hence, We shall be glad with all our hearts, for we Had rather have their room then company: For many an honest gentleman is gone Away for want of place, as look ye yon: We guess some of you Ladies hither come To meet your servants wh' are at dice at home; You'l be deceiv'd, and therefore will dispraise, And say this is the worst of all the plaies You ever saw: but keep your censures (pray) Until you meet them here another day. Our Poet is not confident, nor doth Distrust his work, but labours 'twixt them both: He hopes it will be lik'd, and well; if not, 'T can be but hiss'd at worst, and soon forgot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primi Scena prima. Enter Carionil, and Falorus. Fal. She has out-gone my belief by't, I did not think that project would have fail'd; I cannot speak her. Car. The Alpian snow is not more cold. Fal. Her disposition is most strange. Car. 'Twere easier far To spurn the soultry Cyclops Anvil down, And kick it thus into Atomes in the air, Then to obtain her love; It were, my dear Falorus. Fal. O think not so Carionil. Car. Have I not cause? Fal. At last after a constant and a brave pursuit She may be won. Car. Could I but hope so much, Did all the stars malignant influences Threaten fate opposite to my happiness, I would not deem them worthy my observance, But persevere till I obtain'd, or fell. Fal. Conjecture still the best. Car. Tis easier to advise then to perform; Had you, Falorus, been so oft dismist Comfortless, scornfully sent away, By her own lips, (O heavens!) you could not think it. Fal. I could and would. Car. With hope friend? Fal. Yes with an assurance. Car. Upon what ground would you build it? Fal. Upon a womans frequent dissimulation. Can you believe, when envious clouds deprive Your eyes from the suns beams, that it shines not? In these times young Ladies for a while Do mantle their affections in dislike: Let not an ignorance of Virgins wiles Disturb your noble breast with weak despaire; Carionil assume a confidence: Were you inferiour unto her in blood, Or any whit deform'd, after her nayes You might suspect the period: but seeing 'Tis known, as noble blood runs through your veins, And that nature compos'd you in a mould As excellent as she was form'd in, and With substance of as beauteous a gloss; You need not let doubts puzzle you. Enter above Lucora and Nentis. Car. Stay and admire with me; exalt your eyes to happiness. Fal. Your Mistress and her Woman, my Carionil. Car. Lucora, She's a transcendent of Epithets. Fal. I see a Lute: let us escape their sight, And it is likely we shall hear her sing. Lucora. Now give it me. Is it in tune? Nen. Yes Madam. Car. Forbear awhile to play upon the spheres, Ye servants to the Deities: the Gods Will blame you, if your musick keep the ayr Of her all-ravishing harmony from their eares. A song. 1. Sweet Diana, vertuous Queen, By heavens edict Guide of night, That dost affect the medows green, And dost in fresh-leav'd woods delight; Like to thy Nymphs, suffer me To consecrate my self to thee. 2. Thou that for lust diddest transform Rash ActÃ¦on to a Hart; Either most strongly Maidens charm, That men may never them divert From purity, or else make Them other Harts for virgins sake. Car. How! a votress to Diana, The heavens forbid that injury to earth. Had the deceitful Syrens such a voice, And bodies of so rare a form, I would Nere come on shipboard, for fear of being drawn To drown my self by swimming after them. Nen. I do not like her Madam. Luco. Who ever yet spoke ill of Daphne? fie! Banish such impious censures from you. Nen. Troth, Madam, I should have been glad to a been my Lady Apollo. Luco. O rellish more of purity Nentis. Alas, 'tis a fraile comfort can come with a husband. Nen. I think otherwise indeed Madam. Luco. Be all such thoughts remote from my breast, My resolution shall be never to marry. Exeunt. Car. Now you have heard her thoughts Falorus. Fal. That she disguises not her love you mean. Car. True, and I am most miserable. Fal. My happy friend you will be. Tis an ignorant common custome among young ones to do so. Car. But she's a fixed star, and cannot move. Fal. Fixed in your heart tis likely, But otherwise I doubt nor do you. Car. Y'ave stird a feeble belief within me, Friend, That the excellent Lucora may be won, And I will nourish it unto some height. Fal. A necessary that none must want, which do Desire fruition of those whom they wooe. Enter Jaques. Car. O honest Iaques! Iaq. My Lady presents her service to your Lordship. Car. She is in health I hope. Iaq. Very well. And I am glad to see your Honour so, though I say it. Car. She is not towards another husband yet? Iaq. No certainly. Car. Methinks her fortunes should give her a various choice. You are elsewhere employed I perceive: remember my best respects unto your Lady. Exit Iaques. Y'ave heard of my cousin Vandona, Falorus? Fal. But very little. Car. She's the most phantastick piece of woman-kind I ere chang'd breath with, but a young one, wealthy, and truly not unhandsome. Fal. Lorece does intend to make love unto her. Car. Your brother, my Falorus? Fal. Yes, so he told me. Car. May he obtain her if you wish it. Fal. Her estate would make the match a good one. Enter Cleanthe. Is this the boy you so commended to me? Car. 'Tis he, and think him you worthy the praise I gave him. Clean. He'l come and wait upon you at night, my Lord. Car. 'Tis well Anclethe. Fal. You spoke him not unto his merits. Car. You are beholding to my friend (Ancleth.) Enter a Page. Fal. Your Lord's in health? Page And desires to speak with your Lordship, Fal. Where may I find him? Pag. He'l be at this lodgings these two houres. Fal. I'le wait upon him presently. Exit Page. I am his servant. Carionil, I must take my leave. Car. The Gods go with you. He may be my father in law, but will not if he can prevent it: Adieu friend. Exit Falorus. O my Anclethe! thou canst not guess the world of torments I nourish here; I cannot number them my self, and because I cannot, I fear the Gods will not. Clean. What can you ail my Lord? Car. Canst thou imagine me free from misery? Clea. Indeed I did. Car. No, there's a Lady (she's above all Ladies, And were she pitiful, I should swear a goddess) That does deny me happiness. As thou hast me, Idalian Archer, so On her use thy eternal stringed bow: Draw to the head thy shaft, and let it fly; For love but love there is no remedy. Exit Car. Clean. Wretched Cleanthe! to what a multitude Of woful sighes my destinies have driven me! Could all the tears that I abundantly have wept, But find that recompence I dare not look for, O they were showers to be belov'd like those That deck the spring with bravery! Carionil (For whom I languish in disguise) it seems Hath setled his affections on a Lady Does not return him love. May she continue Obstinate ever: but I must blame her judgement, Who can behold a man (with all the art Of nature) fram'd to curiosity, And heare the world report his vertues equal Unto his form, and not admire and love him. Enter Lorece. Lore. Now my young sweet face! what pretty foolish whimsies trouble thy pate, that thou lookest so composedly? Clea. Sir, I am as I use to be. Lore. Then you use to be scurvy. Use the Tavern once or twice a day. You must not be so melancholy. Clean. It best becomes me. Lore. Canst thou swear? Clean. The Gods forbid. Lore. Canst thou sing. Clean. Not worth your hearing Sir. Lore. Say'st thou so! Then will I something worth thine. 1. Of six shilling beer I care not to hear, A barrel's not worth a carret, I as others think, that there is no drink Like unto Sack, White wine, and Claret. 2. Diana's a fool, and me shall not rule To live a bacheller ever; For I mean not to tarry, in her livery, but marry, And quickly, believe me, or never. 3. And I and my wife will lead such a life, As she shall think well befel her; For throughout the year we'l tipple March-beer, And seldome be out of the Cellar. 4. All Stoical prate, and Diana I hate, With her maidenly scurvy advices: Green sickness upon her, sweet Venus I honour; For wenches and wine are not vices. 5. Woo'd Baccus the knave had met with this brave Diana, this whey-blooded Lady; For the credit of 'th grape he had made a rape, And got a puissant babie. Cle. Y'are not melancholy Sir, your brother is more solemn. Core. I melancholy! I scorne it boy. Yet I'me not so merry as I was wont, the young gunner Mr. Cupid had somewhat tam'd me: but I am good mettle still (thank my jovial fates) and will sound melodiously, my young Paris. Enter Jaques. Welcome to Hercules noble Theseus. Good boy, Go wait on thy master. Exit Cleanthe. How do'st, thou old magazine of precious knavery? Iaq. I am glad to see your Worship well. Lore. My noble milner of words, thou that dost grind thy speeches with a merry pronunciation, wilt be my bosome, my cabinet, my friend Iaques? Iaq. I will obey your good Worship. Lore. Liberally spoken! when I have opened me, will you be privy? Iaq. Very secret and officious: it is good manners in me, your command shall wedge my tongue, hedge my heart, and tye a true lovers knot upon it with the strings of it. Lore. Thou art an honest clod of earth, Iaques. Tis pity the malicious sun-shine warm'd thee not into a diamond. Iaques. Your Worship speakes above my brains. Lore. I am marvellously enamour'd on your Lady, Iaques. Vandona is my Mistris. Iaq. Wonderful news! Is my Lady your Worships sweet-heart? Lore. Yes. But ignorant of my affection yet. Iaq. I could be drunk were you my Master, Sir. Lore. I would have a Wine-cellar o'th purpose. My estate Iaques is but mean: It must be craft must get her: Knowest thou any possible way to win her? Iaq. Sir, I am passing empty of invention, but wherein I can pleasure you, tell me at any time, and I will not fail you. But the Gods bless your good Worship: Sir, would you marry her? Lore. Yes my old trusty Perithous. Why dost wonder at it? Iaq. She does nothing all day but read little Comedies, and every night spends two or three hours on a great Tragedy of a merry fellow Dametas, and a company of strange-nam'd learned Lovers, she's no more houswife then you or I Sir, on my own proper knowledge, I swear, vow and protest it. Lore. Thou art too earnest my old-fac'd Saturn, I think her not the worse woman. Houswifery is the superficies of a genteel female, and the Parenthesis of a Lady, which may well be left out. Iaq. You are a Scholar, your bookship shall direct me. Enter Phyginois. Lore. Who's that? knowest thou him Iaques? He walkes corantoly, and looks big. Iaq. And like your Worship, this tide first brought him to my eyes. Lore. He came not by water, did he old Boy? Iaq. I meant Time Sir, the London word. Phy. When we this passion into us receive, Our former pleasures we do loath and abandon: Iaq. Leave, by your leave. Phy. If it were foolishness in us to take Affection, why did heaven two sexes compose? Iaq. Make, would make Rhime. Phy. Why Period to the PhÅnix doth fire give, But because it doth against nature consist? Iaq. Live, he should say. This is some very smal Poet. Phy. Ile on, and am resolved to preferre My life to be a service unto her. Lore. What an affected utterance has this fellow! Iaq. He'l nere make good Ballad warrant him, that will not rhime when he may. Lore. The Catastrophe was in rhime though. He would be lik'd for a stage Poet. Phy. Noble Heroes! the Gods extend your fortunes to your thoughts. Lore. An Academical Idiome: enquire his name Iaques, he delivers his mind after the garb of a Signior. Iaq. Have you a name friend? Phy. I answer to Draculemyon. Iaq. Good Sir, let's trudge hence; this is some great Conjurer. Lore. Are you a Necromancer? Iaq. Mr. Lorece, I fear he is some Saracen, he looks so dismal. Lore. Art thou a Panim, speak? Iaq. For all your great looks Termegant is an Idol. Phy. I am nor one nor other, but your Honours vassall, and a poor Englishman. Wilt please you to hear the Musick of Helicon? Iaq. Law you now Sir, how one may be deceiv'd! I believe the whorson is a Fidler. Can you sing (sirra?) answer me. Phy. I am no Fidler; but live by my tongue and legs: will you hear me (noble Sir) speak a Parnassian Oration, or see me measure the ground with a dance? Lore. What saiest thou Iaques? Iaq. Why now Sir, tis dinner time with my Lady, and I dare not neglect her, neither will I my own stomach, and therefore for me he may shew us a fair pair of heels, and be gone. Lor. Well thenâspend this for me. Phy. Y'are, Sir, the best part of a moralist: you are most liberal. Lor. Come Iaques. Iaq. I follow you Sir, farewell goodman Draculemyon. Phy. The Gods bless me, there's a name! Exeunt. Proceed Phyginois, and be fortunate; This project will furnish me with mony to cloth me Both fashionably and rich enough, and then I dare assail my Nentis with some confidence: Politick Lovers seldom miss. Smile heaven upon my plot, that there may be A crowned Period to my policy. Exit. Scena Secunda. Enter Polidacre and Falorus. Pol. How do you like Lucora? Fal. She's a Lady above my thoughts, much more my tongue. Pol. Could not you wish her yours? I have a desire to make her so. Fal. Ambrosia Hebe's Cates are for the Gods: Princes she doth deserve to wooe her love. Pol. You undervalue her my Lord; The best is not too good for him that gets her. Your breeding has been worthy your descent; I've known you from your Infancy, and am Desirous to make you mine. Fal. He enforceth me to an acceptance. I must temporize with him, Most worthy Polidacre, I cannot attain to a greater happiness on earth, then to bear the name of your Son in law. Pol. I thank thee my Falorus. Ile go presently, &amp; get my daughters consent. As you shall not want beauty with her, so you shall not money. Ile take my leave. Fal. I am your most humble servant, my Lord. Exit Pol. VVhat envious Star when I was born, divin'd This adverse Fate, who having such a beauty Profer'd him, would refuse it? The pin'd man VVhom Poets phantasies have plac'd in Hell VVith fruit before him, had not such a cross. The true regard I bear unto my friend. The brave Carionil must not be slighted; The sacred truth of friendship ever shoo'd By force enfeeble all rebellious blood. Enter Carionil. VVell met my dear Carionil. Car. I am happy in your company: y'are my hearts best treasury, Falorus. Enter Lucora and Nentis. But give me leave my friend. Fal. O! I see the cause; your Mistris. Car. Retire ye Clouds, and weep our showers of woe, Because ye may no longer stand and gaze On her, for whom the heavens their circuits go, That they may see, and wonder at her face. Dear Falorus withdraw your self awhile. Fal. The Gods assist your suit. Car. Thanks worthy friend. He withdraws. Hail natures most perfect work, and the continual Idea of my admiring Soul, for whom (if it be your will) I must dye, and by whom (if it is your pleasure) I shall live, live in an unspeakable felicity by enjoying you, who shall dye happily for wanting you, and I cannot live in such a penury. Nen. VVoo'd I had such a servant: I should not serve him scurvily. Car. Honour your poor adorer, Lady, with a gracious look of your beloved eyes, and my misery for you both with commiseration and remedy. Luco. My Lord, if you presume upon a womans Feign'd carriage to her wooers, leave it now. For (if you'l give me leave) I'le call to witness Every particular Deity we adore, That I will never have a husband: and For your saying you must dye for me, I hold it A common Complement of idle Lovers; And wish you so much happiness, that you May live well without me. Cario. O be not so unmerciful! Let not that tongue erre into virulent words, VVhich could have cal'd Euridice from Hell. Had your most excellent mother (fairest Lady) Inexorable been, you had not been, Nor Crimson Roses ever spread upon Your lovely cheeks, nor had the world discover'd Two Planets more: hath nature liberally Heaped the rarest perfections (she could give Mortality) upon you to no end? No surely, nor can I believe that she Ment to enclose a mind infractible Within a body so powerful to subdue. As you (even your dear self) was daughter to A beauteous mother, so you also should Indebt the world unto you by your issue: Be not so cruel therefore (dear Lucora) Let not your tongue degenerate from your form. Luco. Sir, you have heard me speak what I intend. Car. Be not a Tygres Lady. Luc. Any thing but a wife: Sir, I must leave you, and leave you this humour; The Court hath many Ladies, take your choice. Nentis! Nen. Madam Luc. Come my Lord take my counsel. Nen. I could use him kindlyer. Car. What say you Lady? Nen. Nothing my Lord. Exeunt Luco. Nent. Car. Doth a fair face presage a cruel heart? I'st not a meer full contrary in Nature, That the softest body should be hard'st to win? Nature is grown decrepit, and all things Sublunary erre against her rule of order. Stir not then thou glorious Fabrick of the heavens, And periodize the Musick of the spheres. Thou ever yet fast fixed Globe of earth, Whirl-round in a perpetual Motion. Ye Stars and Moon that beautifie the night, Change rule with clear Hyperion, and so cast Succeeding time into another mould. Then with thy powerful beams, Apollo, draw The Ocean into clouds, and drown the world: So there a new creation may befall, And this life be a life celestial. Enter Falorus, O all my happiness on earth, my true Falorus! Lucoraes beauty triumphs in my breast, And shortly will destroy me: There's no beast That haunts the vastest Affrican wilderness. Of such a merciless constitution. She'l never marry man. Fal. She will Carionil. Her father would have her, and she has not so much evil to contradict his will: where then can she make such a choice as you? that in a duel, your Grandfather did kill hers, y've heard her oft protest she valued not. Car. Does he desire it, or does your love flatter me into a little possibility of obtaining her? Alas, if she could like me, her father would very difficultly consent. He loves not my family. Fal. Polidacre could not hinder you, were she willing. But (friend) her father means to marry her. His own lips offer'd her to me. Car. O ye just heavenly powers! then I am lost, Sunk into misery beneath a spark Of this lives happiness. Falorus, you shall not have her. Fal. I would not wrong my noble friend so much. Car. A puff of wind and gone. For her who would not Do all mankind an injury, and out-act In horrid deeds all those that ere profess'd Licentious Atheisme? unsheath your sword; I will not take that life basely away Which next unto Lucoraes I esteem, Yet stay. Fal. He's frantick! withdraw this frensie O ye Gods. Car. You are my friend? Fal. I have been so accounted by you. Car. Let me consult it out, shall one word. Na (which is less) one sillable (friend extract Out of me all the interest that I Have to Lucora, by affecting her: But this is a safe medium, a true friend Exceeds all words, and syllables at height; A man may, nay he should poize equally His love, and part unto his friend the justice of it, Which is the full half; so that it appears They should be lov'd by's as we love our selves. But to a Mistress who would not give more? Who can choose to give more? the love that we Bear to a friend, it is an accident, a meer one: But tis our nature to affect a woman, And 'tis a glory to preserve a Mistress Entire to ones self without competitors. My reason's satisfi'd: no friendship can Keep in the sword of any rival'd man. Fal. Collect your self Carionil. Car. You'l fight with me? Fal. I do not wear a weapon for such a Quarrel. Car. What more affliction! yet tis against manhood, (A most ignoble murther) to take his life Who makes no opposition. And yet if death Prevent him not she will be his. Sad fates! You shall not have Lucora. Fal. You wrong our amity by this suspicion: I swear I will not. Car. How! Fal. Consider (dear Carionil) I grieve To see my friend so over-passionate, It is a weakness in you to be pittied. Car. My love ore-sway'd my reason: pardon me My best Falorus, I believe your vertue Would not act such an injury against Your own Carionil. Fal. Shall we walk? and I'le tell you all that pass'd 'Twixt me and Polidare. Car. I am a thousand waies obliged yours. Fal. You are my Carionil, I wish no more From you then a perpetuity of love, And that our hearts may never be unti'd. Car. You are too worthy for my friendship. Exunt. Scena tertia. Enter Antiphila sola reading. Fair Antiphila hath hair Would grace the Paphian Queen to weare; Fit to tune Heavens Lute withall, When the Gods for musick call; Fit to make a vail to hide Aurora's blush each morning tide; Fit to compose a crafty gin To take the hearts of lookers in; Able to make the stubborn kind, And (who dislike it) t'be judg'd blind: Though it is soft and fine, it ties My heart, that it in fetters lies. It is a great I know not what. I have not Poetry enough in me to give it a name. These Lovers are the prettiest fooles (I think) in the world. And t'were not for them I cannot tell what we women should do. We desire nothing more then to be praised, and their love to us will do it beyond our wishes. I gave Philander upon his long importunity a lock of hair, and see into what a vein it has put him! I'me sorry he had it not a week sooner, I should then perhaps a had a Sonnet-book ere this: 'tis pitty wit should lie obscurely in any, if a lock will give it vent. I love him not; I shood rather choose his father, who is as earnest a suitor to me as he: yet I know, because of his age, very few Ladies wood be of my mind; but as yet I care for neither of them. Enter Philander. Now I must expect an assault, 'tis in's ear already, he's very fine. Phi. My dear Anniphila, you have receiv'd. Anti. Your verses (Sir?) I have. Phi. I am your true adorer for them Lady. Wood your white hand had done me the honour it did them! Anti. In what Sir you must explain. Phi. That a touch of your skin might have ravish'd me into happiness. Anti. The Lock has alter'd your discourse, I wood it had shut your mouth. Phil. Ther's no need of that (excellent Antiphila) I wood rather deprive my self of my tongue, then that any word of mine should be offensive unto you Anti. You relish too much of the Court. Phi. Polite words can never misbecome a speaker who hath such a subject. Anti. Am I your subject? you have cal'd me Mistress. Phi. You are my Saint Lady, and I must pray to you. Anti. Saints hear no prayers some say. Phi. Pray you shew otherwaies by granting mine. Anti. Have you any more papers? Phi. My mouth shall speak mine own errand. Anti. You must pardon me now Sir, I must leave you. Exit Antiphila. Phi. She yet is obstinate: but I am free From doubt she will continue in that way; There is no cause of fears in womens nayes, For none of that sex means the thing she saies. Enter Rosinda.

I cannot tell Sir. Phi. Y'are overlonely: be merrier, you shood put your self into more companie, you should Tandorix; I respect you for my mothers sake, for whose last sad letter you was entertained here. Ros.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundi Scena prima. Enter Lorece and Jaques. Lor. I am beholding to thee Iaques. Iaq. I will be dutiful to your Worship. Lor. I should be glad to cope with your Lady, now methinks I am of a prompter expression then usual: Lovers and the Muses are cater-cousins. Enter Vandona. My Vandona, Iaques. Iaq. I must vanish like a mist. Exit. Lor. Farewell grave Titan. Ile out with a Poetical Soliloquie in her hearing for my Preludium. The gaudy Stars are not more full of glee, When golden Phebus setteth in the West; Nor do the cheerful Birds with more delight Rejoyce at the new Livery of the spring; Then I to have this miracle of beauty Enter within the knowledge of mine eyes. Van. He speaks well, I woo'd he meant earnest. The Gentleman seems very deserving: but he is something wild. Lor. She shall be stoutly accosted. Impudency is a very happy quality in a wooer. Van. A comes. Lor. Lady, you are not a puny in the Court of Cupid, and therefore (I hope) need not the tedious circumstances of an annual service. I am bold to tell you plainly, I love you, and (if I find occasion) I will maintain it boldly. Van. I pray you (Mr. Lorece) desist. Lor. Never my sweet Vandona; my descent (I know) you doubt not, and my affection you need not. Whilest I live I shall love you, and (if you die) your memory. Van. I shall be catch'd. We widows are glass mettal, soon broke. Lor. I can do no more Lady, and I will do no less. Van. Your habit, carriage, and discourse, Sir, shew you a Traveller. Lor. My boldness she means. Sweetest Vandona, I have been one. The habits, conditions, and situations of many great kingdoms I have exactly gathered into my table-books: and also my fortnights observation of the Antipodes. Van. O strange! have you been there? I wonder how you came thither. Lor. I will tell you Lady. When I was bound thither, I was in Asia at Taxcallau; there we took ship, and in a pair of Oares sailed to Madrid, the Catholique Kings Court. From thence to Naples in Savoy, from Naples to Crema, and thence to Alexandria, where against a tree we suffered shipwrack. Into a new Phaluk therefore we got us, which was rigg'd for Francfort, where shortly after we arrived, victual'd our Gondalo, and threw away our fresh water. Van. Tis a great way thither. Lor. Thence we went to Lisbon, and after to Mantua, and the next morning we came to the Antipodes, at twy-light i'th afternoon. Van. What sights saw you there Sir? Lor. So many sights (dear Lady) that they almost made me blind. Van. Relate a few. Lor. First, Lady, the King is no man. Van. I believe you Sir, for it never could enter my mind that any man inhabited there. Lor. There they have no houses, but the Emperours Palace, where Sir Francis Drake was entertain'd, after he had shot the PyrÃ¦nÃ¦an Gulfe, upon the Mediterranean mount in Russia. Van. Where then lies all the Court, I wonder? Lor. In the Court Mistris. Van. I guess hem but cold lodgings. Lor. Your Ladyship is mistook: they are never a cold; For the Sun, being never above a hundred degrees above Saturn, makes that Climate as hot as Norway. They at the Antipodes hear with their noses, smell with their ears, see by feeling, but taste with all their Senses: for they are the most insatiable gluttons under the cope: and feel not any thing; For they cannot be hurt. Van. This is wonderful. And I cannot imagine how their senses can be so contrary to ours. Lor. No! did you never hear (excellent Vandona) that they are opposite to us? Van. O yes! I have indeed. Lor. I will now tell you Madam something of the South Indies. Van. Has not the Mogul of Persia his bread thence? Lor. The King of Spain hath his gold there, of which the Hollanders took a great prize, when they won the silver Fleet. Van. How I was mistook! Lor. I will give you the situation of the Countrey. Some of the ancient Geographers, as Heliodorus, the Knight o'th Sun, Amadis de Guale, and Palmerin de Oliva, affirm it to lie a thousand Italian miles from the Isthmos of Corinth: but some modern writers, as Don Quixot, Parismus, Montelion, and Mervin, say it is a Peninsula in Arabia FÅlix, where the PhÅnix is. But learned Hollinshed affirms, the South Indies are separated from Armenia by the Calidonean Forrest, from Asia Minor by the Venetian Gulfe, and from China by a great brick wall. There instead of Chery-stones children play with Pearls: and (for glass) the windows are of broad Diamonds. Hunters there have no horns but the Unicorns; no water runs there but Scamander, Simois, Aganippe, Hippocrene, and the like. There are no hills but Olympus, Ida, and Parnassus. No valley but Tempe of Ascra and Margiana; no men but of the off-spring of Scipio Affrican, Iulius CÃ¦sar, Alexander the Great, Hector, Hanibal and Hercules. Van. It is a pleasant Countrey sure! Lor. I will now tell you the conditions of our neighbour Nations. The Spaniards are humble, the Italians chast, the French peaceful, the Dutch sober, and the Irish cleanly. I came at last to Virginia, where I saw nothing more worthy mention then an honest woman who cast her self into the sea because no body would lie with her. In conclusion; at Iames Town Port I took horse, and the next morning (after a long and tedious journey) arrived in Wales. Van. And what did you there Mr. Lorece? Lor. As soon as I could I went to Merlins Cave, which is obscurely situated on the top of a Beech, where all the night he lay on the ground. Van. What was he Sir? Lor. He was an intricate Prognosticator of firmamental Eclipses, and vaticinated future Occurrents by the mysterious influences of the sublime Stars, and vagabundical Planets; generated he was by the inhumane conjunction of an Incubus; And was immur'd alive in a cave, by the preeminent Magick of the Lady of the Lake. Van. You frequent Playes, do you not? Lor. They are most commonly my afternoons employment. Van. I like him the better for it.âAside. Van. And you have read many Histories? Lor. Many, Lady. I am a worm in a book, I go through them. Van. This pleases me tooâaside. Farewel Sir. Lore. Admired Philoclea, leave me not so. Van. What would you have? Lore. Your consent Lady. Van. Expect that a month or two hence. Lore. Dear Vandona, sweet Mistress! Van. Indeed you must. Lore. Nay, sweet Oriana. Van. Y'are two importunate. Lore. Excellent Claridiana, Polinarda, Laurana, Bradamant. Exit Van. It makes no matter, I am sure to have her: how some women are taken with strange tales! Next time we meet I do not doubt to get her, Hercules could not wooe a Lady better. Ent. Iaques. Now my old Anchises! how dost true penny! Be merry Iaques. Iaq. Is she tender-hearted? Lor. Respectful and pliant. Iaq. Good truth I am glad on't Sir; my Lady (though I say it) is of a very good nature, my mind alwaies gave me she would be coming on. I beseech your Worship to be a good Master to me. Lore. Thou shalt find me so. Exuent. Scena secunda. Enter Cleanthe sola. Cle. Imperious Love (that hatest whom thou woundest, and lovest those best thou dost let alone) If my obsequious duty unto thee Can move thee to commiseration, Instruct me how to win him, and (when I Disclose my self) assist a wretched woman; For it is in thy power to work my bliss. He dotes upon a Lady that regards None of those miseries he undergoes By languishing for her, with one fair stroke Thy ignominy redeem: thou art cal'd blind, Because how thou dost shoot thou dost not mind. But what availes it me thus to implore, Or rather to reiterate those deep wishes, Millions of houres can witness I have say'd, And yet find no help? Ah my dear, and ever Most lov'd Carionil, would thou wert so Strongly inflam'd as I, or didst conceive, Truly didst know, what misery lies here! I think (though thou hadst suckt a ravenous Wolf) It would overcome thy nature, and thereby Transform my sorrow to felicity. Enter Carionil. Car. I cannot hope, a letter I have writ To my Lucora, can find that acceptance, And bring so good success I wish it may: Sure never man so passionately ado'rd A Lady of so froward a disposition; If I could know the cause she is unkind I would destroy it, or destroy my self. Anclethe! art thou there my boy? alas! Why dost thou weep? Clea. To see the sorrow you are alwaies in, And not to know wherefore. Though I (Sir) am Both young and little, I both dare, and would Venter my life to do your any service That may redeem you happy daies again. Car. Alas poor boy! it is past thy redress; Yet I do thank thee for thy love unto me. Enter Rosinda. Cle. My Lord, a servant of my Lord Polidacres. Car. Tandorix! what news? Ros. The Lady Lucora commanded me to deliver this Paper to you. Car. Tis most welcome, would my heart could read it. Ros. I wish he had my daughter: for he's a noble gentleman. Aside. My Lord, command you me any service? Car. Onely my dear respects unto the Lady that sent you. Ros. Farewel Anclethe. Exit Rosinda. The Letter. Car. SIR, I am sorry that (against my use) I cannot answer you more civilly; but I am blameless: The fault being in your foolish passion, and not my desire. If in fairer terms you should receive my reply, I am sure you would think it some beginning of love to you; according to your desire I have none, and I wish your love was so as mine, so we might be friends: yet I love you as a Gentleman of my acquaintance; but if any more you trouble me with letters or courting, I will hate you. So I end, Her own, Lucora. Her own Lucora! I cannot now conceive This Lady of a humane nature, sure A woman cannot have so harsh a mind, So I end! what will she end so alwaies? O then that I might end even now! that all The sorrow that possesseth my whole body In every member, would mutiny against My heart, that so I might die speedily! Is it not miraculously strange, that this Poor microcosme, this little body, should Contain all the sorrow this great world can Inflict upon it, and not sink beneath So huge a burthen? one hill does overcome The strugling of Enceladus a Giant, And yet I stand, I live: what, am I of Lucora's temper, impregnable? oh, oh, oh! Cle. Alas my Master! good my Lord, collect Your strength, and be not thus effeminate. Car. I'me manly boy: for women cannot tell What thing affliction is, their stony hearts Relent so little at it in their lovers. Oh! I shall never have her! now I give Liberty to a just despaire to wrack me: And it must ever do so. What a Chaos Of misery is an unfortunate Lover! Cle. I pray you (Sir) put off this vehemency of passion, she will relent. Car. Never whil'st I live. Cle. She will indeed, I know she will. Car. Woo'd she would love me after I am dead for her: It were some happiness to think that, Anclethe. Cle. I doubt not but she will shortly be yours (my Lord) And weep for joy to hear me make relation Of this same violent passion you are in now. Car. Thou art a good boy, but this Lady, O my heart! Could sitting down in Cassiopeia's chair, And kicking proud Arctophylax from the skie; Could stopping the Septentrian sevenfold teame, And putting out the starry Eagles eies; Could swimming violently up those Rocks From which the Memphian Nilus tumbles down; Could the compelling of rash Phaetons Sire To change his course, and run from north to South Could the adventuring to undertake A journey through Affrickes dread'st wilderness, When the Ãolians do loudest breath, And vale the Sun with sandy mountains height; Enforce her to repent the Tragedy By these attempts drawn on me, she should find What truth of love was in her servants mind. Clea. Keep back his hands, O heavens, from violent deeds, Let him not offer injury against His own dear life. Car. I have pratled too much: but I ha done. No longer shall my happiness be delaid, Nor the displeased destinies any more Jeer the sad depth of wretchedness I live in, ThusâHere I fall her cruel sacrifice. Clea. Hold, for heavens sake hold. Car. Tis too late to prevent: Patience Anclethe! commend me to Lucora, That Angel beauty without Angel pity: Tell her my wofull story, how (ere since Thou knew'st me) I have languished for her; That I have spent whole nights in tears and sighes, What days in solitude to think of her; That I did suffer her unkindness, while I had a dram of patience left within me: Tell her how her most cruel letter rais'd A despair higher then my strength, and that Under her strange unkindness I am faln. Weep not Anclethe! I am faint, struck dumb. Fly passionate soul into Elizium. He faints Cle. O my dear Lord, brave young Carionil, I'le wash thy wound with tears, stop it with sighes: Unkindest day that ever wore the sun! Thou art accurst for giving light unto His hand to guide it to an act so much Beneath manhood. O me! I am undone! What now will my disguise avail me, Foolish sister Lucora! O ye heavens, Where lies our difference? are we not the same By birth on both sides, of one sex? sure nature Degenerates against it self, or this UntimelyâO ye Gods I dare not name it, Nor will I believe it; he is alive, So suddenly the world cannot be ruin'd, Which is if he be lost; all vertue gone, All valour, piety, and every thing Mortality can boast of. My Lord, noble Carionil! he doth not hear me, alas! I am for ever most desolate of women: Injurious heart-strings break, why do you tie Me to a life millions of degrees more lothsome Then the forgetful sepulchre of death? Would some commiserating benevolent star (Which carries fare in't) would in pitty to My misery, take me from it: for love he Lies here this bemoaned spectacle; and shall My passion be undervalued? tears, nor sighes, Nor Dirges sung by me eternally, Can parallel our loves at full, 't must be The same way, and it shall; the same blade Shall be the instrument, and I receive it Tragediously here on my knees; wood some Kind body would interr us in one tomb: Be firm my hand, and bold. Fal. Anclethe! Enter Falorus. Cle. My Lord Carionil cals, istt you! thenâ Fal. But I must hold you, and bereave your hand. Cle. And you may also die, your friend is slain; My noble Lord Carionil is dead, The paper in his left hand yet, that brought His reason into such subjection, That he even frantickly did stab himself. Fal. I will extend my life till I have read it. He reads the Letter. This Lady is a rough blown sea, on which His worthy life has foully suffer'd shipwrack: I have her! not Mercury pleading in her defence With Oratory able to stint Ioves wrath (When he has bespoke thunderbolts of the Cyclops, To wreak some injury) should ever win me. To her bed. Polidacre, mew her up Like Danae in a brazen fort, or else Make her to answer with her life this murther She's accessary to: proud piece of vanity! I do want words to give my thoughts expression; So much I hate her. Prithee Anclethe pardon My injury against thy rest, for holding Thee in a life so loth'd as this is to thee: Ile lead thee. Car. Oh, oh! Cle. Withhold awhile my Lord: he groans. Car. Thou art the cause Lucora, and I must not blame thee: I struck not that blow right, but this shall do't. I am fainter then I guess'd, I have not enter'd. What! who has stole the Stilletto from me? Boy! Anclethe, restore it as thou lovest me. Fal. Carionil, I joy you are recovered: Death is grown courteous, or by this you had Been wandring in the Elizian groves. Car. My friend Falorus! Fal. Your loyall friend. Give me your hand and rise: âI'me glad to see Your wound no worse. Twas care and willingness To die bereft you of your Senses. I will shew you How you may win your Mistrisâyou hear me. Car. I like it well: it may prevail, I hope It will. Fal. Anclethe had slain himself had I not come. Car. Good boy, thou wert too kind. Cli. Indeed my Lord I never shall desire to survive you. Car. Divulge my death. Cle. I will not fail. Fal. Why (my Carionil) would you engage So much your self to any of that sex, As for a disrespondency to lay Violent hands upon your self? Intruth (my friend) I wonder at it justly: You merit more then they can satisfie With their endeavours all of them. Car. Proceed not (good Falorus) in this language. Fal. What good do women! old Amphitrite's face Is not so full of wrincles, as they are Of vices. Car. No more, as you regard (what alwaies yet You have profest) our long continued friendship. O women, most admired Creatures! how Can the just heavens these speeches so allow? What good do women! I do say what ill? Who do perform what men can onely will. Why have we ears, if not to hear the sound And sacred harmony their tongues compound? Why have we tears, if not to weep when we Do chance a woman discontent to see? Why have we eyes, if not to look upon Their beauties, natures high perfection? Why have we tongues, if not to praise them, when They slander'd are by railings of ill men? Why have we reason all, if not to deem us Happy, because some women do esteem us? Fal. You are their worthy champion: what I said Was out of passion for Lucora's dealing. I will report y'are dead. Car. I shall be obliged unto you by't. Exeunt. Enter Phyginois solus. Phy. My clothes are almost made, and every thing That does belong unto the habit of A gentleman, I have prepar'd me richly; For in these garments I dare not accost her. I had good fortune to come with Cleanthe, Who hath been very bountiful unto me. Enter Polidacre, Rosinda, Antiphila, Lucora, and Nentis. Pol. Lady, I take it very kindly you Would do me such an honour as visit me: It shall be my study to deserve it. Ant. My Lord, this is too ceremonious: Pray you let us walk. I much approve of this Aire: I know no place so sweet about the City. Ro. How observant he is! he would fain make it a match, and I think she is willing enough. But I shall prevent them with amazement. I will see further in it first. Phy. The heavens (worthy gallants) be serene as long as you presume under the safety of them. Pol. Know you this fellow Tandorix? Ro. His name is Draculemion. Pol. O! I have heard of him. Luc. Tis some frantick. Pol. What wind brought you hither? Phy. That which (noble Sir) shall blow me all over the Universe to do you service. Pol. I thank you for your complement, your Captainly protestation. Phy. Brave Bevy of gallants, my purse being Millions of degrees voyder of money then my heart of courage, I desire to empty my mouth of words, to fill up the vacuum of it, if you please to lend me your attention, and afterwards to commemorate (with munificence) the worth of my Oration. Pol. Sweet Antiphila, what say you? Anti. He speaks so strangely I would hear him. Pol. Draculemion, you know what to do. Phy. Hail (but fair weather) I that have been the favorite of inconstant fortune, and term'd worthily by the worshipfull title of a gentleman, am now debas'd into an humble fugitive. Commiserate this wonderful change (most excellent Auditors) and let your recompence be a help, again to restore me, and a story to exalt me towards the fastigium of my pristine felicity, and (at your connivence) I will post afoot to Mexico, drink your healthes till I'me sick, and kill any I hear speak irreverently of you. These, and more then these will I accomplish, though to my perpetual ignominy, or dissolution of my life, conditionally you will bestow fluently upon your slave so undeserving a little. Dixi. Pol. Heres for all the company. Phi. Will you give me leave to be grateful? Pol. Yes surely. Phi. Ile not desire the Muses to repleat My willing genius with poetick heat: This subject doth transcend them: Ile desire Apollo to this Lay to touch his Lyre. Thou Charioter of heaven, that dost invest Thy swift-hoof'd Coursers in the dewy East (With harness work'd by Mulciber) to light The world, and dissipate the clouds of night; For Phaetons sake (not unto me unlike) Thy sweetest notes unto this ditty strike. Pol. If the Exordium be so long, t'will be tedious before the conclusion. Anti. Dismiss him therefore. Pol. Farewell Draculemion. Phi. Would I might kiss thee before, Nentis.âAside Exit Phi. Pol. Madam, how do you like the Lord Falorus? Anti. Very well my Lord. Pol. Him I have often motion'd to Lucora, And he hath consented to marry her, would it not Be a good fortune for her think you? Ant. Indeed I think it would. Pol. How say you now Lucora? Ant. For he is a much applauded gentleman, Of good conditions, and of sweet behaviour, Whose company is every where acceptable; He deserves a good match, such a one as your daughter is. Pol. How say you girle! was any thing I told you Of Falorus, a falshood? Come prethee do thy self a good turn, And take him, do Lucora. Luc. Dear Father, pardon me, indeed I have not Any desir yet to marry. Pol. Sure you have! Bethink you, and speak wiser. Luc. Truly I have not Sir, Pol. Y'are a stubborn wench, and I am sorry It was my hard fortune to be thy father: Your shrewdness shal not carry you through so freely (As you believe it will) it shall not maiden. Anti. Do not chide her. She will be rul'd by you. Luc. Indeed Madam I had rather live as I do. Pol. No I believe not that. There is some one Or other farre inferiour unto him Whom she's in love withall, perhaps some vile 'Scumme of the Town. Luc. Dear Sir, you conceive amiss of me; for I Love no man yet, and hope I never shall Be of another mind. Poli. Tis false, I cannot believe you. Luc. If ever I should Id'e hate my self to place Affection on a man of base birth, or Unseemly qualities. Anti. Be not angry Sir. Nent. I pray you marry (Madam) for it is A state wherein one may securely kiss. Luc. Leave thy foolery, Nent. O tis a fine thing to have a coach of ones own, to go to a play when you will, And be restrain'd from nothing you have a desire to do. Luc. Marriage is no such liberty as you make it. Pol. Think of my will: I give you time. Exeunt all but Rosinda. Rosin. They have hard fortune (which the Gods remove) That (where they cannot) are compel'd to love: I woo'd she had Carionil; I esteem not the ancient Enmity Between the families. Enter Phyginois. Now Draculemion, how do you? Phy. At your beck, and in good health, brave sparks of generosity. Ros. I must needs attend my Lord, otherwise We would have had one pint together. Phyg. Thou art a joviall Lad. Farewell. Ex. Rosin. O my Nentis! thou art a worthy Andromache, and dost deserve Hector the couragious Trojan Wagg. Enter Philander. Phil. They are not here. Phyg. I must to my trick agen. Divine Apollo, and the Muses nine, Can ye behold his ruine, unto whom Ye have vouchsafed sacred Poesie? Or see him sleep under a hedge i'th field, Who hath so often on Parnassus lain? Or seek the River for to quench his thirst, Who at BÅotian Hippocrene hath Pledged Mnemosyne in full-fraught Cups? Or wander bareleg'd, who upon the Stage Hath acted oftentimes in Sockes and Buskins? Or see him tan'd for want of an old Hat, Whose Temples (unto his immortal praise) Ye have so richly view'd begirt with Bayes? Phil. Daculemion! I am glad to find thee: I'le have a speech. Phyg. Your VVorship shall. As yet the contentious night has not exterminated Hyperion from the celestial Globe; who daily useth to hawke with the firmamental Eagle, and to hunt Ursa Major round about the Forrest of the skie, to go to plow when he wants Corn with Taurus, and (when he is hungry) to eat Aries, and at night (when he comes 'ith VVest) to court the Lady Virgo to be his bedfellow, whom because he cannot obtain, he lashes on his horses, and goes and reports his stubbornness to his friends at the Antipodes. Nor as yet hath the Trumpeter Boreas blown stormy Clouds into our Horizon to deprive our eyes from the powerful radiance of his orbicular and refulgent head. Nor as yet am I weary to do you service, nor will be while I am able. Phil. Here's for you. VVhat a wordy nothing thou hast spoken? Phyg. You have given me current silver for it. Y'are a bountiful gallant. Exit. Phil. My father is my Rival, and I find To him Antiphila is most inclin'd. What the Fates will we never can prevent, And (till the end) we know not their intent. Exit. FINIS Actus Secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertii. Scena Prima. Enter Falorus solus. Fal. A potion he hath took, and is orecome By the deceitful working of't, and lies As if he had no interest in this life. Lucora I have sent for, that we may See how she'l take it, for by her carriage now We shall perceive if there be any hope. Enter Cleanthe. What will the Lady deign her presence here? Cle. She will my Lord. Falo. Tis well. Cle. And is at hand of entring. Falo. Prithee Anclethe, bid them bring out my friend. Exit Cleanthe. Though once Carionil did not believe My protestations to him to relinquish All title to Lucora, yet I meant it: Were she a Lady farre more excellent, And richer in the ornaments of Nature; Did she exceed the fairest of her Sex More then fine-featur'd Mars the ugliest Satyre; Were her tongue Musick, and her words enchanting, And her conditions gentle like a Goddess. I'de rather carry Ãtna in my breast, Then be disloyal to my friend, farre rather. Enter Cleanthe, and Servants putting forth a Bed, with Carionil upon it. Thou art most dutiful, Anclethe; O Art! Natures most curious imitaciesse, How like a body late depriv'd of life Does he lie sleeping without motion! Enter Lucora, and Nentis. Cle. My Lord, the Lady Lucora, Fal. Draw back: But stay you here Anclethe. Exeunt Servi. I thank you Lady for this favour to us; Were Carionil alive he would require it. He would unto the utmost. Luc. My Lord, I'me sorry that a gentleman reputed ever Most wise, and voyced by a general fame To be complete and perfect in all goodness, (The which Carionil was) should thus destroy The great opinion all the world had of him: His depriving himself of his own life For that foolish affection he bare me, (I having often told him that he spent His service barrenly, and that it would Yield him no fruit) was such a weakness in him, That his lives honour his deathes shame hath ruin'd, Hither I came at his dying request, Which (his Boy told me) was to have me see What my obdurateness hath urg'd him to; For so he term'd it: his desire is satisfi'd: Were he alive agen I could not love him. Sir, I should love him less for the poor weakness This act accuses him of, I should, believe me; And so my Lord I take my leave. Nent. Had I been his Mistris he had liv'd.âAside. Fal. Stay Lady, Shew more respect, for truly he deserv'd it. Clean. But kiss his lips, if you will do no more. Luc. The Boy and all. Clean. Speaks reason. âAside Luc. His will I have accomplish'd. Farewell Sir. Exeunt Luco. and Nent. Fal. Hath she a heart? or if she have, what mettal or stone is it of? Dost thou not think (Anclethe) that man happy Who's free from all the molestations That are concomitants to affection, And to the grievous bondage of a woman? Cle. My Lord contingently. Fal. Thy timeless inexperience doth deceive thee: Believe me boy, there does not live a woman Who more then complementally is my Mistris. Cle. Sir, you do not fear to love one of them? Fal. Yes: and the Gods keep me still in that fear: Sure such another as Lucora put out Cupids eyes. O women, women! Cle. Truly my Lord I do believe all Ladies Are not cruel; indeed I do. Fal. Thou art too young to be suspected; otherwise I should think that some subtile false one had Beguil'd thy youth. Nature has work'd the Potion out. Cle. My Lord recovers strength. Car. How ist? Fal. How does my friend? Car. Repeat my destiny. Fal. Receive it with as calm a quietness As I deliver it: your ear! âPrivately. Cle. Vouchsafe him patience, O ye Gods. Car. When huge-wav'd Rivers from the earths high banks Precipitate themselves into the Ocean, Will stilness follow? Can you think then, can you, I may be quiet? was Iove so, when the great Brood of the Earth, the Giants did assay Olympus conquest? Can I then a poor Dejected man be calm, when all the misery The world can send it pours on me fully? Ãolus, run thy ventrous sword again Into the Rocks, and give an Issue to The winds, that they may with their irefull blasts Remove the world from off it's stedfast hinge. Or blow the Pole-Stars out, and so let fall This Globe we breath on. Or (by whirlwinds force) Both Sexes collect together, and carry them In't places opposite; The one into The Arctick, the other the Southern Regions, And let them of themselves propagate the like: So womens Tyrannies can do no ill, And men perform what one another will. Fal. This savours frantickly. Cle. Deprive him not of reason, but exalt Him to himself, O heavens! Ah me! Car. Tis true. The sea is alwaies full of water, (The Lands do relieve it) and yet has no cause For lamentation, but wofull man Hath but a few, indeed a very few Salt tears to mollifie the burthenous draught Of misery which his malignant Stars Compell him to endure. What? his Mistris venome obstinacy? not possible, Tis unsufferable, above our frail carriage. Fal. The word friend, waies all titles of honour down, And therefore not by them, but that I beseech you Not to neglect your self. I've lately known The time when death almost inevitable Could not unfix your thoughts. This cause is weaker. Car. How! Fal. Believe me friend. Car. Believe you! I would believe thee friend, Didst thou affirm absurdest contraries: That the Sun was extinguished, and the bright Moon was blown out, and all the Stars were faln, And nature (yet harmonious) disordered Into another Chaos, I would believe you: For rather then you should pronounce a falshood, Things that are not would be. Fal. Alas! you are distempered; I grieve to see you so for so poor a cause. Car. It is a weighty one, and if the brave Fam'd off-spring of Alcmena had endur'd it, He had enlarg'd his labours to thirteen, And been another wonder to the world. But (noblest friend) you know the History, How he the knotty club did lay aside, Put off the rough NemÃ¦an skin, and don'd Maidens apparrel, for the love he bore To ruin'd Picus daughter, young Iole. Fal. But he nere offer'd violence to himself. Cle. He did not Sir, be counsel'd by your friend, Do my good Lord. Car. He had not cause, she did return him love; And (except in this case) I would suffer Beyond expression from another hand, Without a thought to use my own. But you May say I'me passionate: tis right, I am so I know't, and you cannot expect less from me Were I as free from love as you have known me. You should not taxe me with that fault, although Unstable fortune made an Irus of me: But you may call this boasting. Fal. Far be it from me, tis a perfect truth. Cle. Ah, Alas! Car. Leave sighing boy prethee. Fal. Come, You shall be temperate again (my friend) And have fair likelyhood to obtain your Lady. Car. Impossible! Fal. I've form'd the plot already, you must be, draw near. Car. How a Negro, an Ethiopian! t'is frivolous. She is too obdurate, most obstinate. Fal. Hath she not refused the bravest and handsomest gentlemen of this kingdome? You cannot deny it. Be therefore counselled, She that cannot love a man of a better complexion, On one of them may settle her affection. Car. I have some hope again, you shall stay with my friend, refuse it not I prethee. For many conveniences it is necessary; I every day shall see thee, and shortly will take thee agen. Cle. My Lord, I beseech you. Car. Nay, my Anclethe let me not use words, As thou dost love me deny me not. Cle. Sir, I am charm'd, and will obey you. Fal. Come, lets walk, and I'le instruct you fully. Exeunt Omnes. Scena secunda. Enter Iaques solus drunk. This London wine is a parlous liquor; twill turn you a mans head so long round, that at last 'twill set it where his heeles should be: another glass ont had prov'd me a reeler, a cotqueane, which I was never brought up to; I learnt a song of my old grannam, many a good ballad she would have sung me by the fire side ore a black pot, but your city wine is a more stinging liquor. She left me a very fair cow, but a villanous thief stole me her, (foul cheeve him for it) and escap'd I know not whither: but alls won, much good do him with it, my Ladies Worships service is better then a team of oxen. But the song must not be forgot. 1. All that about me sit, Laugh at my pleasant wit, And neither cough nor spit, Till I have done a. For I will sing a song, That fitly shall be long, To a cow and not wrong Mount Helicona. 2. Don Quixots Rosinant, And Sancho's asse errant, And Bankes his horse do want What she may brag of. They would ones breech much gall, And give one many a fall, Sufficient therewithal To break ones crag off. 3. That Jove did love a steed, I yet did never reed; But by all tis agreed Io he loved. No beast upon the field, Doth man more profit yield, Whither alive or kild, As may be proved. Well, I'le to my chamber and sleep awhile, otherwise I'st ha a foule deal of do to keep me on my legs this afternoon, Enter Lorece. Iaques is now a very Barnabey! Lore. Iaques! so ho my boy! Exit Iaques. His match is extraordinary, sure the rogue's drunk, He's so very deafâ The report is that Doctor Aristotle cast himself into the sea, because he could not (with all his rambling Philosophy) find out the natural cause of the ebbing and flowing of it: but (had his good scholarship been troubled with my Mistris) he might a jolted out his brains against a rock, for his dulness in inventing a method of wooing to win her Ladiship withal. I here will sit and muse. Sits in a private place. Enter Vandona and Iaques. Iaq. Indeed Madam I will be very serviceable unto you, if now and then you will suffer me to be blith and full of merry moods: Van. Iaques! where ha you been? Ia. At the spigget. Is it not a very rainy wet day? Van. Thou art well washed within. Iaq. Tis a very dark day: the sun shines clear tho. Van. T'hast a light head Iaques. Iaq. And yet I cannot bear't stedfast on my shoulders, wine's monstrous strong. Let me see who am I? Van. Th'art a fool. Iaq. The play's the better for't. Van. Y'are a drunken coxcomb, go. Iaq. Thou captive Greek, I am a Beglerbeg. Van. Thou woot be a beggar and thou leav'st not thy drinking. Iaq. Thou me Roxalana! am not I the great Sultan? Van. A booby. Iaq. You shew your breeding to upbraid the Majesty of the Grand Signior. Van. Peace, no more fooling. Iaq. You are drunk with north countrey Balderdash, you keep no wine, water your kitlings with beer, nothing but wine shall be drunk in my court. Van. I shall be troubled with him else. Embassadors wait your return at your Palace. Iaq. We will withdraw: send the Bashaes after me, they shall present me wine. Exit. Lorece discloseth himself. Van. Is he here? I shall be courted certainly, and perhaps shall yield. Lore. Most welcome happiest Genius of my life, Dearest Vandona, let your lilly hand Enrich my lips. Van. Y'are very complemental, servant. Lore. Mistris, faith I love you, as for millions of causes, So also for a natural demeanour, It showes you are no of-spring of the City. Van. You would marry none of them, servant? Lore. No, six thousand pounds cannot hide a squint eye, a crooked back, or a red head, or a muddy face, though they may gild them. Van. This is very Satyrical, but there be Beauties of all coloured hair, eies, and complexions. Lore. I at any time will carry you to a Play, either to the Black Friers or Cockpit. And you shall go to the Exchange when you will, and have as much money as you please to lay out, you shall find me a very loving husband in troth dear Lady. Van. But servant, you have been a very deboist gentleman. Lor. Forget what y'ave heard, and you shall hear no more on't. But we are extravagant, come, let's to'th joyner. Van. To whom, and for what Mr. Lorece? Lore. To Hymen in his saffron coat, to be married. Van. Some other time, a month hence will serve. Lor. Then must I court another bout. Van. What you please Sir. Lor. O Cupid the Bow-man, I am not thy foe man; For I love this woman, As well as I know man. And therefore I pray thee, From mischief to stay me; And quickly to lay me In bed with this Lady. Van. What call you this Sir? Lor. Tis my imploration, and ode. Van. Y'are! very fluent Sir. Lor. And yet neglected. But Ile make Cornelius Gallus speak English, and he shall wooe for me. Van. What say you servant? Lor. Be you attentive, and you shall hear. My sweet Vandona, fine and comely lass, (Whose beauty Milk and Lillies doth surpass, And the sweet Roses, both the white and red, Or Indian Ivory new polished) O spread, O spread abroad thy yellow hair, Like glorious gold, shining all out as fair: Thy purest Alablaster neck, and show's VVhich (from between thy graceful shoulders) growes; Open thy Starry eyes, and let us view Their browes above them of a Sable hew: And both thy Roseal cheeks let us espie Beautified with a natural Tyrian die. Put forth thy lips, their Corral let us see, And (Dovelike) gentle kisses give to me. Kisses her. Of amorous life thy breath did draw out part: Those kisses peirc'd me to the very heart. Why didst thou suck my blood (O cruel she?) Henceforth thy dugges (like Apples) hide from me, Which with Ambrosiack cream shall swell thy breast, Discloseth Cynamon I yield, and best Delights arise from thee: yet thy Paps cover, Whose growth, and beauty, do make me a lover: For seest thou not, that languishing I lye? A man half dead how canst thou thus destroy! Van. This is meer flattery. Lor. Tis but a spark (Madam) an almost invisible atome of truth, which can scarce be discern'd in the Sun-shine of your perfections, credit me Madam Van. They are most childish will believe all that their servants, say, my most poetical Servant. Lor. Most obdurate Lady. Van. Will you wrangle? Lor. Was ever Widow so hard to win? Sure your husband got not your maidenhead you are so backward. Van. Adieu Sir. Lor. Not yet I pray you sweetest Lady, ifâ Van. Pray you trouble me with no more speeches. Lor. O cruel reply to a Lovers suit! If ever you have felt this passions pain, If ever you would pitied be your self, Or if you know that Love hath power to kill; For all these (which you heretofore have been Subject unto) commiserate a heart So full of love for you that it will break. If you deny: But if you will remain inexorable, And frown on him who ay must fawn on you, I wish my fortune may be yours, and that If ere you love you may be served so. Van. I'm but a woman, and these words would move A stupid rock to pitty, Sir I can Resist no more, your tongue has magick in't: You have overcome me, and enjoy your conquest. Lor. My dear widow, let me kiss thee for this! thy date of wearing black is almost out. O my joy! methinks I could out-sing old Homer, the nine Muses, and put their Patron Apollo out of fame. Enter Falorus, Cleanthe and Phyginois in brave apparel. My Vandona, yonder is my brother, he will be glad to hear of my good fortune. Fal. Who's he? Clea. A friend of mine (my Lord) Fal. I shall be desirous (Sir) both for your own, and for Anclethes sake, to be better acquainted with you. May I demand your name? Phy. Your servant is cal'd Phyginois. Fal. How have you sped brother? Lor. She will be cal'd your sister: salute her, go kiss her for't. Fal. Lady, I hope my brother will deserve you, By proving an affectionate husband to you. Phy. Madam, I am a stranger, but will endeavour to make my self known unto you by any service I can do you. Van. Thank you Sir. Phy. My Nentis doth excel her sisterâAside. Lor. Come brother, will you go with us? Fal. Ile wait upon your Mistress. Exeunt Fal. Lor. Van. Cle. My faithful friend, may all thy wishes prosper, And a fair end crown them most happily. Phy. Sweetest of Ladies! Clea. Thou didst prefer goodness before the raising of thy house. Phy. It grieved me to think so noble a Lady should be so poorely dispos'd of; My brothers birth, nor forunes could deserve you. Cle. I was ignorant, and might have undone my self. Phy. I did pitty you. Cle. And ever have oblig'd me to you for't. Phy. If your sisters woman Mistress Nentis be obstinate, and you prosper; Hereafter you may do me a multitude of favours. Cle. I nere will fail to do the best I can; now let us follow them. Love is a passion not to be withstood; And (until hearts be mutual) never good. Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Enter Carionil solus like a Negro, in strange apparel. Car. An houres life is like the various year, Which hardly bears one form a fortnights space: He sure deserves respect that to obtain His Mistress, thinks all trouble a content. These two years have not had so many quarters As I disguises, scarce as many daies As I devises, and yet to no purpose: What I may do in this I cannot guess; But for mine own purpose must hope the best. My late long residence ith Spanish Court, when I lay there Leiger Embassador, Hath made me speak the Castilian language perfectly; Which will be my great furtherance, because, Polidacre affects that tongue exceedingly; And I know will gladly give me a free access Unto his house at all times. Estoy yo (como deue) muy lobrego; Porque de mi, Lucora haze un Negro. Enter Polidacre, Lucora and Nentis. They shall not see me yet. Sir, your daily importunities have so mov'd me that I must yield unwillingly, onely I request to have our marriage defer'd a month dear Sir, do not deny me this. Pol. I thank thee girle. Enter Falorus. Welcome Falorus: my daughter's yours after four weeks be past. Fal. Worthy Sir, y'are too bountiful. Most excellent Lady, you will make my fortune envied. I must dissemble yet, for I will not wrong Carionil. Nan. I like this well. Luc. But I will rather die then have himâAside. Car. I do not doubt my friend. Pol. I have laboured much for you. Car. Now I'le disclose my self, and counterfeit the Negro as well as I can. Taken forth of Acaucana. Y pues en todos triempos, y occasiones Por la causa comun sin cargo alguno, En battallas formadas, y esquadrones Puede usar delas armas cada uno: Por las mismas ligitimas razones E's licito combate de uno a uno, A pie, a cavallo, armado, disarmado Ora sea campo, abieto, ora estocado. Don Carionil, would I could hear of thee! Luc. He is the brav'st proportion'd African I ever saw. âAside. Pol. I will speak to him. Habla (voste) yngles? Car. Yes Sir I learnt your language at Brussels. Pol. I shall be most glad (Sir) to be acquainted with you. Car. Grave Nelides years be doubled (most honourable Hero upon you; your courtesie has won one of the greatest Ethiopian Lords to become your servant. Luc. What an unequal'd carriage he is of!âAside. Car. You look, Sir, like a noble Gentleman, I salute you. Fal. Well, Don Carionil maist thou prosper, your Mistress has consented a month hence to marry me, but doubt me not my friend. Car. According to the Ethiopian custome, Great Lady, I adore your pantofle. Luc. You are a worthy, and a noble Moor. Car. This is your shadow; you shall command me fair one. Nen. Thank you Sir. Pol. I heard you mention Carionil. Car. Tis true, When we were in the Spanish Court together, I being commanded thither an Ambassador From th' Emperor of both the Ethiopias And of the mighty kingdoms and vast countries Of Goa, Caffares, Fatigar, Angote, Xoa, Barne, Balignazo, Adea, Vangue and Goyamine, He wrong'd me, and I am come hither to seek him; And with my sword to punish his rude language. If you will tel me (Sir) where I may find him, You shall eternally oblige me to you. Pol. He is lately dead Sir. Car. You do but jest. Fal. I was with him when he died. Car. Then he had not so honourable an end as I intended him. Pol. If I should not seem too inquisitive, I would desire to know your quarrel. Luc. I am much taken with this objectâAside. Car. You may command me any thing. We meeting in the presence one afternoon ('Mongst many things) did happen to discourse Of Ladies; he said that none of all the world Were so beautiful as the Spanish: I that had read in many histories The English have the best and loveliest faces, Did tell him so, yet could not change his mind; After long altercations he grew hot, Gave me the lie reprochfully; which forced me to tell him, that though I owd so much honour to both the Majesties of our great masters, as not for private wrongs to disturb our Embassies: I meant before I died to visit his countrey, and call him there unto a strict account. Pol. I thank you for your free relation; While you intend to stay in England, use My house at your pleasure, I pray you do, Your company will be alwaies welcome to me; And I love the Castilian language, which You speak both readily and purely: May I demand your name? Car. Tis Tucapelo, and I'me subject to Great Prestor Iohn (whose powerful Scepter awes Sixty two Kings) and in Garama live Magnificent for silken palaces. Fal. His behaviour is without suspicion âAside. Pol. Tis dinner time or nigh, pray you be my guest; You shall be very welcome (Sir) both now and at all times. Car. I'le wait upon you. Pol. Falorus, let me intreat your stay. Fal. You shall command me. Ex. Pol. Car. Fal. Luc. Injurious tyrant Love! Nentis! Nen. Madam. Luc. Stay a little. How frail is any womans resolution! I that so seriously have often thought Never to change my name, am now become A slave unto a Moore; I feel the mighty Fabrick of all maiden vertue totter. What may befall me worse? but I may as well Withstand a volley of shot, and as easily, As resist these new desires: tis very strange That I who have denied the earnest suit Of so complete a Gentleman as was Carionil, and neglected his friend, (For I will rather steale away, and do Mean services to my inferiors, Then be his wife) should dote upon a person Some Ladies scarce dare look upon, a Moor, A sun-burnt Moor I'me utter stranger to. What would my father say if he should know My thoughts? banish me ever from his sight, And never more think of Lucora's name. But Love is not confin'd to the opinion Of others. O this is a revenge for my Slighting of brave Carionil; yet if He were alive again I could not love him. Alas I am undone! O that my Fates Had been so kind as to have wrought my heart Fit and propense to have requited him? Nentis, will you be silent of my love? Be so good Nentis. Nen. Why, Madam, will you have this Blackamoor? me thinks my Lord Falorus is a handsomer man by much. Alas! he will take you beyond sea. Luc. Nothing is strong enough to divert me. Nen. Your secrets (Madam) are as safe in my breast as yours. Luc. Befal what will, I am resolv'd. Affection that doth tend Not crookedly, but to a noble end, Is worthy; and they stubbornly repine At their creation who from it decline. Exeunt ambÃ¦. Finis actus tertii.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quarti Scena Prima. Enter Phylander and Antiphila. Phy. Sweetest Antiphila! Anti. I wonder Sir, in what I have so forfeited my faith that I cannot be credited. Phy. Urge me not, Lady, unto a belief, That will be my destruction: Delay me rather with a little hope, And save me from despair. Ant. I can but say what I have said already. You do not trust my tongue; Pray take a parchment, And there inscribe a sad and solemn Oath; And I'le subscribe that I will never have you. Phy. The fatal Ravens hoarse crying Is Thracian Musick unto your reply. Would I had heard a thousand Mandrakes groan, So you had left me in silence. Ant. I pity you, but did you know me truly, you would bless my denial (young Philander.) Phi. Bless it! O Lady, Durst I but be so horribly prophane As to curse any thing you please to do, I would go study imprecations, and Vent them in places that are haunted by Wild walking devils; but my grand affection Condemns that violence. Do not then suppose That though you were a Suceubus, I durst Utter such impious breath. Be all the faults (That either truth or Poets fictions Have shewn in women) in you, I will love you With serious admiration. Ant. Sir, I will release your affection. Phi. Impossible. Not the fairest creature (by diligent search pick'd out Of all the infinite Myriades of beauties, Selected from the spacious kingdoms of The Earth, and I might chuse her freely) Should win upon my heart to dispossess you; She should not Lady. Ant. You will not hear me. Phi. Then may eternal deafness seize upon me: Speak Lady, and though you do say the last Word I shall ever hear, I will with joy Be most attentive. The dark cave of sleep Is not more quiet. Anti. I am contracted. Phi. You are not Lady. Ant. I am Sir. Phi. Unto my father? Ant. No. Phi. Then sentence his sure death by naming him. Ant. Will you destroy the man I love? Phi. And you him that loves you? Ant. What is done cannot be undone. Phi. It shall. Ant. You must not know his name therefore. Phi. If there be any manhood in his breast, He shall disclose himself: Ile challenge him By such sure circumstances (and set the papers On publick places by the Play-Bills) that if He dares but use a sword he will be known. Ant. So you will publish my disgrace. Phi. Too true, O Lady, dear Antiphila, Give me his name. I will not kill him foully, We will meet fairly: I may die upon His sword, and you thereby be freed from my Unworthy suit. Ant. Sir, promise me one thing, and I will tell you. Phi. Here is my hand, you shall charm me. Anti. I must lye, and grosly, to be rid of his Courtship. âAside. It is Tandorix. You must not speak of it unto any, or quarrell about it. Phi. Tis not: you mock me (sweet Antiphila.) Ant. Indeed Philander I do not. You will be secret for my sake, untill I do release you of your promise. Phi. Y'ave had my hand: silence must be my death. Ant. Ile leave you Sir, and build upon your word, For I perceive you are displeased. Exit Antiphila. Phi. This tis to be a fool: which is the truest, And briefest definition of a Lover. What fury fascinated so my sences, As wilfully to make me become a slave Unto the childish passions of a woman? On this occasion wood I understood The saddest Epithets of Necromancy, That I might joyn them to this sex: O my heart! I am orecome with rage, and will be rather A perjur'd Mahumetan, and wade Through streams of blood into her arms, then a Soft-conscience'd ass, and let this villain have her: Could envious hell suppose a body of So delicate a composition, cood Within it lodge a mind so poor and worthless? This is a womans weakness! no, tis a baseness Cannot be match'd in all the faults of man. But why am I so angry? I will shew My fury, not in idle breath but deeds. Enter Rosinda. And this shall be the time; thou base ambitious Slave, before we part thou diest. Rosin. O good Sir, why? I nere offended you, Heaven knows I love you best of all the world, Phi. Thou art the hinderance of all the bliss I could expect or wish for upon earth. Ros. Sir, let me hear the reason of your rage, And (if you find that I have injur'd you) I will not beg for life. Phil. Find it! I know it clearly, And will not honour thee, vile man, so much As't let my tongue joyn such unequal names. Ros. I understand you not: Dear Sir, be plain. Phi. Art thou prepar'd to die? if not, kneel here, And pray thy self into a readiness. Rosin. Be not so violent. Phi. Repent. Ros. Let me understand my offence; the chrysome child Is not more innocent of wrongs to you, Then guiltless I. Phi. The tears of Crocodiles! Ros. I humbly do upon my knees implore you That you thus rashly will not take away The life you never can restore, and will Bewaile for in an overlate repentance. Phi. To heaven, and not to me make orizons. Ros. I am resolv'd. For your deceased mothers sake (at whose Sad funeral letter I was entertaind Into your fathers family) and for Those tears and sighes, and sorrows she did weep, Groan, and express at her delivery of you, Be merciful unto a faultless stranger. Phil. A tedious and an exquisite torture for Thy death, should not deter me from it. My mother (Could she arise out of her watry grave, Appear in both our views, and be an eloquent Suppliant unto me for thy life) should not Prevail to win me to it. Ros. Then nothing will satisfie, keep in your sword; I am your mother, draw off this Perriwig, And my face will establish your belief. Phi. It does indeed; here prostrate on my knees For my rude language I do crave remission. Ros. And you obtain it and my blessing too; But you deserve blame for your violent fury. O let me kiss your gracious hand, and seal My pardon on your happy lips. Why did you grieve us for the sad report Of your untimely end? Rosin. You shall know all anon. But yet conceal My being, till your fathers love be ripe, And grown mature for a second marriage; I pray you do. Phil. Mother, I will. Now I've good hope Antiphila will be mine. Scena Secunda. Enter Carionil, Lucora and Nentis. Car. And Lady you shall not wish any thing (If that an humane power can obtain it) But I will make it yours. I hope you do Not wrong my love with a suspicion That I cannot perform what ere I promise. Luc. I do not, Sir, distrust your affection: But give me leave to doubt I shall not live According to my content in Ãthiopia. Car. Most noble Lady, I that have seen both places, Dare promise you, you will. Luc. I cannot tell Sir, I must believe you. Car. For these few words (whose sweetness doth exceed Vast and elaborate volumes of eloquence) May all the joyes that ever have made happy The numerous Queens and Empresses that have Been ornaments and glories to the world, Meet unto their perfection in you. Luc. My Tucapelo! when I did see you first, I fell in Love as deep as Lady could. Car. And may I dye when (in unperfect thoughts) You do repent your choice: Mistris, I can Make famous Gamara as pleasing to you As is your native Countrey: You shall find Delights above, not equal to your mind. Luc. Sir, your company shall be all things unto me. Car. You shall not touch one drop of water, but shall Be of more virtue then the Thespian spring, Where reverent Poets of the former times Quaft off huge bowls to great Apollo's health. Young virgins (whose sweet voyces do exceed Mnemosyne's daughters) shall sing you a sleep Each night, and (when you grace the happy woods With your rich presence) they shall make a consort With the innocuous queristers of the spring, To entertain the Mistris of my life. Nent. And I go thither they shall teach me to singâAside. Car. The Jewel-tippets of your ears shall weigh The curious points of precious Isicles, When Leo breathes hot vapours on the earth. Your sedulous slaves (enrich'd by noble bloud) Shall bear your Litter through the tedious streets Of Gamara, while all the gallant youth Within it runs to wonder at your beauty. Luc. I do believe you love me so much Sir, That you will shew it all the wayes you can: And I do thank you for it, and love you, And I will shew it all the wayes I can. Car. O happiest speech my ears did ever hear!â Amphions musick made not such a sound; Nor Orpheus Lute that tam'd the stubborn spleen Of hells inhumane dogge, when he did play For the redemption of his ravish'd spouse; Nor PhÅbus (when unto his gold-strung Lyre He for superiority did sing His sweetest Anthems and best Madrigals Against ambitious Pan) made harmony To parallel the sweetness of your tongue. Luc. If that all my endevours can deserve At this height your affection, by my fault It never shall decrease. Car. You over-act me much, but never shall Have thoughts beyond me. Luc. I pray you spare my company a while; A while I would be private with my woman. Car. Lady, I will do things unwillingly At your command: but give me license (fairest) To print my heart upon your heavenly lips, Ere my departure henceâThe Ottoman Emperours âKisses her. In their immense Seraglio never saw Your matchless features in their numberless Successive multitudes. I am so blest, That my excessive joyes cannot be guest. Ex. Car. Luc. Nentis! Nent. Madam. Luc. Unfold thy heart unto me: Let me know What thoughts thou hast of me. Nent. I may offend. Luc. Indeed thou shalt not. Nent. Then I do wonder (Madam) that you will Bestow your self (I think) unworthily. Luc. How! Nent. This is unpleasing to you, I will be Hereafter silent: I have offended you. Luc. No: proceed. Nent. You are a Lady untill now unstain'd With any blot (save obstinacy to The brave deceas'd Carionil) and will you Give the world reason, a good one (pardon My honest boldness (Madam) to taxe your judgement; And (which is worse) your virtue for this choice? Is not Falorus far more worthy of you? Marry him (Madam) and live still in England. I'me sure my counsel would be seconded By all the friends you have, did they but know As much as I. But (Madam) if you have Settled your affection past recall, and are Resolved, I will be most obedient And secret unto all your purposes. Luc. And wilt thou go to Ãthiopia with me? Nent. If I do get no Servant before, and if You will (if I dislike the country) give Me liberty to return home. Luc. Most willingly. Enter Falorus, Cleanthe, and Phyginois. Nent. My Lord Falorus. Luc. Where? Phyg. If I can find the least opportunity I will try (Nentis) of what mettal th'art made. Fal. I hope (Mistris) our company Is not unwelcome to you. Luc. By no means Sir. Fal. How gently it past her tongue! For that sweet word I kiss your hand, dear Lady. Luc. Where did you leave my father my Lord? Fal. Above a reading Guicciardin. Nent. Sir, I can perceive when I am flatter'd. Phyg. Earnest expressions of love deserve a better name. Nent. Why Sir, I cannot believe you love me. Phyg. You need not doubt of that, Mistris, I do With as much fervency as servant can; I do beseech you Lady to believe me. Nent. They are of easie faiths that believe all their servants say. Luc. What ail you my Lord? you are not well. Fal. Unwelcome guest awayâI was thinking ofâ Luc. Of what? Fal. I ha forgotâwould they would all love meâ âAside. I am most strangely alter'd on the sudden: My friendship (I fear) will be too weak a tye To make me silent. Clean. My Lord! Fal. Thou hadst a Master did deserve thee better. Cle. But he is dead, and I am yours by his Last Legacy. Fal. What wouldst thou say?âAside. Cle. I hope y'are well. Fal. He has found out an alteration in me: I must beware of publick signs. I was Privately. Full of Carionil; my thoughts were busie Concerning him: Madam, I pray you pardon my neglect Of frequents visits; I have been too guilty. Luc. You have not offended. Fal. Tis your great goodness to say so. Nent. This, Sir, is too importunate. Phy. To slack (dear Mistris) but wink at my insufficiency. Nent. You said, you love no woman in the world But me. Phy. And may you hate me if I do. Nent. As I see you ready to give me full satisfaction that you mean faithfully, so shall you find me willing to requite you. Phy. No man can boast such happiness. Nent. Sir, be moderate; y'are not so sure of me, but (upon occasion) I can retire; neither would I have the company take notice of us. Phyg. You shall command me (Mistris) Fal. These passions are new to me: woo'd I were private. I never did observe her so well before. Luc. My Lord! Fal. What say you (Madam?) Luc. You saw not my brother Philander to day? Fal. No truly Lady I did not. Luc. Your brother (Nentis saies) shall shortly be married to. The rich widow her sister. Fal. So he doth hope. Enter Tandorix. Rosin. Madam, dinner stayes of you. Luc. You hear my Lord. Fal. Nay Anclethe, stay not for me, wait on the Lady: Ile follow immediately. Exeunt Luc. Nen. Phy. Clean. What ailes me? let me see What is the cause of such an alteration I find within me: doubtless it is Love. To whom? to whom but to the worthiest And sweetest Lucora? Take heed, tis dangerous; A sudden ruine so will seise my friendship, And prove my former protestations Feign'd untruths. Cannot the noble name Of young Carionil prevent me? No, Nor certainty of all the evil wills Of all the friends I have; Were-both our better Genius Orators, And here embraced fast my knees, and wept Miraculous tears (to quench the rising flames Lucora's irresistible eyes have kindled In me, or to drown this late impression Love Hath seald upon my heart) I'de be as remorseless As the most stern and unremoved Scythian, And deafer then the people that inhabit Near the Egyptian Cataracts of Nile. But I am base, base to infringe the knot Of amity a long and serious knowledge Of each other hath tyed betwixt us. Twere safer Sayling with drunken Mariners between Hard Sylla and Charybdis, then to sufter My much divided thoughts, and forth of them To work such a conclusion to my passions, As might hereafter confirm me noble in Th'opinion of the world: but I'me most ignorant, And know not what to do. Wood I were so Distraught, that my own self I could not know. Exit. Scena Tertia. Enter Lorece, and Vandona. Lor. Sweet Mistris, your bounty will become An envy unto future times. Van. So let your love Sir. Lor. But speak (my Dear) what happy day shall give A fair conclusion unto all my wishes? Van. What haste good servant? Enter Jaques. Lor. Nay be not angry Sweet. Ia. Madam (and please you) your own good servants desire to shew your Worships some pretty pastime. Van. It pleases us well: when begins it? Iaq. Eene presently; Ile goe and tell them all what a good woman you are. Exit Ja. Lor. This is not usual with you? Van. Indeed Servant so seldom, that I remember not the like: Sure tis for your entertainment; they think I have Been a niggard of it, and help to make it out. Lor. You are too good. Van. So you can never be. Lor. And yet I will not fail to do my best. Van. I pray you do not (dear Lorece) for tis a good resolution. Enter Clownish Maskers. Lor. I see we shall have some odde thing. Van. I wish Sir it may prove worthy your laughter. Lor. My fair Vandona, I believe you will have your desire. Van. Iaques is among them: he may move you. Iaq. An'ether of you ask what's here, tis a Mask Which we Actors do hope will content you: If not, when it ends let us all part friends, And of your attention go in and repent you. I hope your Worships will say I have pronounc'd this well enough. Lor. To my content honest Iaques. Van. I'me glad you like it. Ja. Come Hymen, thou fellow that always wear'st yellow, Draw near in thy Frock of Saffron; Once more I say appear before this gentleman here, And this Lady in the white apron. If the boy thou dost bring hath a voice fit to sing, Lets have a merry new Ballet: Begin thou the Song, and it will not be long (We hope) before he will follow't. A Song. Hymen. Say, Boy, who are fit to be Ioyn'd into an unity? Boy. They that will permit their wives To live pleasant quiet lives, And will never entertain Thoughts of jealousie, if vain. Hym. Now Boy let this couple hear What should be the womans care. Boy. A wife should be secret, true, Most obedient, and no shrew; Should obey her husbands will, While therein she finds no ill. Omnes. Such a Wife and husband too We do wish both him and you. Lor. Prithee Sweet lets be married this afternoon, and this shall be our Epithalamion. Van. Stay my leisure good servant: t'will not be long. Iaq. Now if you please to cast a glance Hither, ye shall see us dance: Fidlers play, begin and strike: What ye see do not dislike. They dance. Lor. What a mad toy tis Mistris! Van. Iaques! this day use my wine-cellar, you and your company May be as free in it as you will. Hym. Her Ladyship sayes well: Good now ho lets go thither, Without more ado. Iaq. Goodman Wedlock, where was your mind marle? Is there not a piece behind yet? Ile not budge a foot till I have discharg'd it. Hym. Out with it then. Iaq. Mr. Marriage, put me not out with your grining: for an you do all's spoil'd. Gentleman and Madam, you have seen What our Mask and performance hath been: If you like both tis well; and if but one, Of the other wood we had done none. For clapping of hands we care not two chips; We are satisfied if you joyn your lips. Lor. I thank you all. Van. And so do I: you now may go. Iaq. And so we must, for I ha done. All's done: this last (what do you call,) was the full end of it. Hym. Why go we not? Boy. I am very dry with singing and dancing. Iaq. Follow me to the wine-cellar. Exeunt Maskers. Van. You must keep your promise: you are expected by this. Lor. Lady, I kiss your hand: This is my vale as often as I come. Ile seal my welcome on your lips. Farewell widow. Van. Remember my service to your brother. Lor. Command me any thing. Exeunt Ambo. Scena Quarta. Enter Carionil Solus. Car. The tedious winter of my many griefs Her calmer heavenly breath hath now blown over; And all my tears and sighes are now converted Into a happiness will soon be perfect. The gallant Courtier Paris Alexander (When he had stole the young Atrides Bride, The sister of the two Tindarides, And with great triumphs entred into Troy) Was sad and melancholy unto me. How wise the Fates are! Ere we can obtain Perfect fruition of the thing we love, We must break through great difficulties &amp; tedious, Unto the end that we may more esteem And prize our happiness when we atchieve it. Thanks (excellent Lady) for your gracious promise: May every Lover henceforth bless your tongue. She hath prefix'd this hour to be the time Wherein I shall out-grow all hope, and fix Upon the proudest height of fortunes wheel. Hail happy hour! This is her chamber window, And this the door whereby she must escape. Enter Lucora and Nentis above. Shine well ye stars, and let this project find Your influences to a lover kind. Nen. See Madam, he is come: My Lord Tucapelo has not trespas'd on a minute. Luc. Then is our parting near: your new servant hath prevented your journey. Car. Nentis! Luc. Most honoured Tucapelo, I am here In presence to give answer to my Love. Car. Are you ready worthiest Lady? Luc. I am, my Love. Car. Neglect your Jewels: Gamara shall supply you. Luc. I care for nothing if I have but you. Car. Descend (my Dear) each minute is an age Until I crown my joyes with your possession. Luc. I come. Nentis farewell: report that my Escape was unto thee unknown, and that I stole away when thou wast fast asleep: I would not have thee blam'd for me. Excuse Me to my father all the wayes I have Instructed thee in. Descendunt. Car. Cinthia, triumph; and let thy brother hear His eyes did never witness such a stealth: Be proud in thy pale lustre, and make known, Apollo doth tell tales, but thou telst none. Not yet! how tedious seems a moment! Delayes in Love Would raise impatience in Olympick Iove. Enter Lucora, and Nentis. But she is entred! welcome sweet Lucora, Above expression welcome, my crown of joy I would not change for an imperial Scepter. Luc. I am most happy in your love (dear friend) Thanks good Nentis: My woman cannot go with's. Car. Then farewell Nentis. Nen. May the propitious heavens crown both your heads with all fair fortune. Car. Our thanks go with you. Exit Nentis. Luc. It is your promise, Sir, that I shall live Without contradiction in my Religion, Enjoy my conscience freely: your vow was solemn. Car. I do acknowledge it, and will perform it. âTrueânot to be denied, what a great frost chils my affection! Luc. Then Ile be confident. Car. You may: I am amaz'd, and lost within a wonder. Let me consider; have I cause to love A Lady that hath so much neglected me, That she hath prefer'd a Negro? And tis likely (When she knowes me) will care as little for me As ere she did, and (if she meets with one Of this complexion I feign) conferre Her perfect love upon the slave? Tis clear, I have no reason to do it, neither will I; For I am free, know liberty again: This poor unworthiness in her hath loos'd me. Would it not be a weakness in me (let me argue it) To bestow my self upon a woman of So obstinate a nature, that she lov'd me less When she believ'd that for her sake I had Done violence upon my self? It would be A matchless one, beyond example, and which Future times would admire, but not parallel. Luc. Come, shall we hence? delay is dangerous. Car. No; be it what it will. Luc. VVe must not stay here long. Car. Nor will we. Luc. Alas! what ailes my noble Tucapelo? You had not wont to answer me so slightly. Do you not love me still? Car. No. Luc. The heavens forbid! I am Lucora. Car. I do confess you are, but must deny I love you. Luc. I could endure your Sword with better ease: Us't, and revenge what ignorant ill I have Committed against you. I had rather dye By your dear hand, then to return from hence With this strong poyson in my breast. Car. Kill you! Lady, I would not do it to obtain The Soveraignty of the Sea-parted Earth. Live many years in happiness: I wish it With all my soul, else may I dye unwept for. But give me leave to leave you, and bestow Laughter, not tears for my inconstancy. Think me unworthy of your worthy self; For I cannot love you, nor will marry you. Luc. Surely you will. Have you a cause to be So merciless unto a passionate Lady, One that so truly wonders at your worths? I pray you (Sir) jest not so solemnly: Thunder is Musick in my ears to this. Car. I do not: credit me (most fair Lucora) I am in earnest, nor would I spend the time In words. Shall I call Nentis? Luc. Rather call Basiliskes to look me dead Then her, to help to mourn your unkind parting. O! do not thus: wherein am I deform'd So suddenly, that you so soon should leave me? Car. This is a trouble to your self: you cannot Speak words enough to make me yours. Luc. Can I not speak sufficiently! Then I Will try if there be Magick in my knees: Look (Sir) a Lady kneels to you for love, She kneels. To whom the noblest in the Realm have su'd. Car. All is in vain. Luc. Thou man (that art more lasting in thy fury Then the Egyptian wonder through the stormes Of many bleak tempestuous winters) Say worthless man, if it becomes thee well To let a loving Lady kneel to thee, And thou be merciless and not raise her up. Car. I pray you rise. Luc. And will you then be reconcil'd unto me? Car. No I cannot. Luc. Then I will turn a Statue. Car. I pray you leave me and forget me ever: Henceforth you shall not see me any more. Luc. Not see you any more! O faithless man and full of perjuries! Thy nature is transparent, thou art false As is the smooth-fac'd Sea, which every wind Disturbes; a false Barbarian, and born under Deceitful Mercury. A Britain would Rather have died then thus have wronged me: Thou art inhumane, and mayest boast the conquest. Tell your most salvage countrey-men this Act, (If the just God of Seas revenge me not) And number it 'mongst your proud cruelties. Car. Be pacifi'd: I pray you leave this rage. Luc. When I am dead I shall, and not before, And that shall not be long; For thou shalt see me, Merciless man thou shalt, and adde that to Thy bloody conquests; boast how a slighted Lady For thy unkindness made her self away. This hand (wherewith I would have given my self Offers to kill her self. To thee) shall take me from my misery. Car. Hold: I am Carionil. Luc. How! say that again. Car. I am Carionil. Luc. That breath hath rais'd me, and made me my self. Car. I counterfeited the Negro to obtain you, The wished period of my griefes; and might, But will not love that woman that shall scorn All my endeavours, and entertain a stranger, An Ethiopian, and prefer him, no: Judg (fair Lucora) if I have not cause. Luc. Yes, yes you have: But now you do not need More of your Rhetorick to disswade me from you. There are not in the world temptations Can make me yours: I cannot give a reason, Tis in my nature, and a secret one. Car. I am glad it is so. Luc. This is the happiest hour My life did ever pass, and quickly chang'd. Car. I rejoyce at the alteration: Madam, you shall Command me to do any thing but marry you. Luc. Then I command you never move me more. Car. I will obey you. Luc. Now you may call Nentis: She is not yet in bed; I see a light yet. Car. Most willingly. Nentis, Nentis. Enter Nentis above. Nen. What's the matter, marle. Luc. Come down. Nen. I wonder much: I come (Madam.) Descendit. Luc. You will be secret, Sir, of what hath past? Car. You may be confident I will. Luc. I else shall suffer much in my honour. Women! take heed: the men whom you deny May win you to be theirs by Policy: They Proteus-like will vary shapes, until Beyond their wishes they have plac'd their will. Enter Nentis. Car. Your woman's come: Good night. Luc. Good night (Sir) Exit Carionil. Nentis, I now will never pass the Seas: Tucapelo is become Carionil. Nen. Amazement ceaseth me! Luc. Anon thou shalt know all. Nen. I hope that now you will be rul'd by your friends, and take the Lord Falorus to your husband. Luc. Hang husbands! Nen. The Gods bless them all I say, and send me a good one. Luc. Let's to bed: lock the door after you. Exeunt AmbÃ¦. Scena Quinta. Enter Cleanthe sola. Cle. How joyfully the birds salute the morn, Warbling a welcome from their gentle throats! But I am of another mind (poor maid!) Aurora doth no sooner blush upon The world, but I make my complaints afresh. I am in love, and for my wretched State Can blame no body but sinister Fate. Enter Carionil. Car. Well met (Anclethe) I will hide no longer My self in this disguise. Again thou shalt Be my Anclethe: wilt thou be my Boy, And sing me songs, as thou hadst wont to do? Cle. You have obtain'd your Mistris I see, my Lord. Car. I have not (boy) nor will I seek her more: Some other time thou shalt receive the story. Cle. My hour is come: dear Cupid be my aid. And will you never have another Sir? Car. I do not know Anclethe, but if I have, She must not be so obstinate as this. Cle. But say a Lady of a noble house (One that is not unhandsom) were in love With you, did love you violently (my Lord) Would you not pity her, but be unkind? Car. Boy, I do know what tis to love in vain So well, and what a misery is in it, That if she were but reasonably well, She should not grieve for me, indeed she should not. Cle. You are most noble: old Philosophy Never defin'd a virtue which you want. There is a Lady Sir, and not ill-favour'd, Born of an ancient honourd family, So much in love with you, that if you do Refuse her (my Lord) you do deny her life. Car. What is she cal'd Anclethe? Cle. My Lord, my Commission doth not reach so farre; She'd have her name conceal'd until y'ave seen her. To morrow morning you may meet her here: She with a gentleman (a friend of hers) VVill here expect you about ten a clock. Car. VVell, I will see her (boy) and if I find Her answer thy report, I will be kind. He that neglects a loving Lady for VVeak causes, may the Gods that man abhorre. Exeunt Ambo.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus quinti, Scena prima. A Banquet set forth: Then enter Polidacre, Antiphila, Servants and Musitians. Pol. You will pardon a sudden entertainment. Ant. I hope we need not complement. Pol. You do instruct me. Sit down (my sweet Antiphila) and taste. Fill wine: All health and happiness to you (dear Mistris.) Ant. A true return of loyal thanks. Pol. Play a more merry tune: I do abhor What ever relisheth of melancholy. Sing, the spheres are dullâ Apply it to your self that best deserve it. [1.] The Spheres are dull, and do not make Such Musick as my ears will take: The slighted Birds may cease to sing, Their chirpings do not grace the spring: The Nightingal is sad in vain, I care not to hear her complain: While I have ears and you a tongue, I shall think all things else go wrong. 2. The Poets feign'd that Orpheus could Make stones to follow where he would: They feign'd indeed, but (had they known Your voice) a truth they might have shown. All instruments most sadly go, Because your tongue excels them so: While I have ears, and you a tongue, I shall think all things else go wrong. Ant. Tis pretty. Pol. Reiterate again your yielding, Lady, And once more let your breath perfume those words. Ant. Sir, I am yours. Pol. And I my fair Antiphila's, your tongue Hath made me happy. Ant. May your joy last long. Exeunt omnes Scena secunda. Enter Philander and Rosinda in womens apparel. Phi. How glad I am to see you like your self! Dear mother; pardon an excess of joy. Ros. Such signes of true affection need no pardon. Enter a servant. Ser. Sir, here's a Letter for you. Phi. For me! from whom? the hand resolves me; Present my service to the Lady that sent it. Tell her, ere long I will come kiss her hands. Ser. I will Sir. Exit servus. Phi. Mother, I writ unto Antiphila, And did desire her (for guerdon of my love) To hold me second in her thoughts, and (if She married not my father) to have me. Ros. She may perform What she believ'd would never come to pass. The Letter. Sir, I confess I am not contracted, and that I told you so to make you desist. I should be exceeding ungrateful to deny you so small a request. There is nothing hinders me from being yours, but your Father: And I solemnly vow unto you, that (if I have not him) you shall have me. But let not this beget any hope in you; for (if I be not his) it shall be his refusal. Let it onely manifest so much, that (had I never seen him) I could have lov'd you most truly. I pray you, let this suffice, and use me so. Choose another Mistris, and let me be her second: You will love me well enough, if you love another better. Farewell. Your Fathers Antiphila. Ros. What writ you to her (Son) concerning her Professing a contract betwixt us two? Phi. That in my rage I met with Tandorix, And offer'd to bereave him of his life; Who thereupon did vow he was a woman, And for a Gentleman cal'd Perimont, (Who often had deni'd to marry her) That habit did assume, thereby to learn More easily what did prevent her joy, And whether he affected any other. Thus I your being kept unknown. Rosin. I'me gald you did so. Phi. You do well, Mother, to wear a mask: you shall Thereby be sure to be conceal'd untill You find the fittest opportunity Your self (unto my Father) to reveal. Exeunt Ambo. Scena Tertia. Enter Falorus solus. Fal. What will become of me (unfortunate man) Who needs must live in fire, or live in shame? I know not what to speak nor what to do, Both fear and grief do so confound my sences: I fear to wrong Carionil so much As to be traiterous against our friendship; And griefs unsufferable endure for the Fairest of Ladies, incomparable Lucora: I would she had been kind unto my friend, Unto him then I never had prov'd false; Nor will I: I will rather search out frozen Climates, and lie whole nights on hills of Ice, Or rather will take powerfull potions, and sleep Out those unpleasant houres I have to live; But then I shall not see that beauty: who But senceless frantickes would have thoughts so poor? My reason forsakes the government of this Weak frame, and I am falne into disorder. Oh! I could sigh my body into air, And weep't into a Lake, if merciless nature Had made it of a substance suitable Unto my wish now: methinks I could level A Promontory into a Province, and tread The centre through to read the destinies Of southern stars, and bless their fortunes that Are born under their light; for (I am confident) Their influences are more mild then ours. There is no other Fate can fall on me Shall awe me now; I will be proud and daring As the ambitious waves, when wrathful blasts Of Northern windes do hoist them violently Against the highest cloudes, and rather will Destroy my self then wrong Carionil. Exit Falorus. Scena quarta. Enter Cleanthe in womans apparel, and Phygionis. Cle. And serv'd my sister well to leave her so. Phy. How much (dear Madam) have you impoverished Mens eies, by hiding your perfections In their apparel? indeed I flatter not, I do not know the Lady owns so much beauty. Cle. If my Carionil will like me, then I shall attain the end of my desires: May I appear but lovely in his eye, And what I seem in others I will slight. But (good Phygionis) tell me I prethee In your affection what success you have. Is Nentis won, or do you hope she will? Phy. She's mine, we are contracted. Cle. Joy wait on you, And make your lives of many years pass pleasant. Is it not ten? are all the clocks grown envious Against my bliss, and will not let me know How nigh his coming is? for I esteem My self most happy in his company. Enter Carionil like himself. Car. This is the place Anclethe nam'd. Phy. Madam he's here. Cle. Befriend me my good stars! Car. Here is a Lady and a matchless one! Wood two years since I had beheld this beauty, When first I came from Spain and had my heart free, Then many a sad day had been merry unto me, For unto her Lucora should have yielded. Sweet Lady, you that are the fairest creature Nature did ever form, vouchsafe so much Of happiness unto me as to give Me liberty to touch your lipsâdo you Kisses her. Know me? and have your ears ere heard So poor a name as is Carionil? But I am much mistook; you are not she Whom here I was to meet: I needs must doubt The fates did not intend me such a joy. Cle. I am. Car. Deceiv'd Pythagoras! hadst thou but dream't The sweetness of this voice, the musick of The Spheres thou never hadst recorded. Speak, Fairest and best of Ladies, let me hear If you have so unmatch'd a pity in you As to look on me with a friendly eye. Can you love me? Cle. Most noble Sir, I do most violently. Car. If that to live with you detain'd me not, I should be griev'd that my joy for so great A fortune did not stupifie my senses, And cast me into an eternal sleep. Where is Anclethe? he is much to blame In not attending you. Cle. Whom speak you of dear Sir? Car. My boy. Cle. I do not know a boy of that name truly: Nor (I think) is there. Car. You do amaze me. Cle. You may believe me, Sir, for I am he. Car. Wonders in Riddles! Cle. I am your Page Anclethe, and sister to Lucora, who for love attended you Disguis'd, because (I found) for the great enmity Between our families) my father never Would give me where I would bestow my self. Car. Your Nurse did steal you when you was a child? Cle. Most true: This gentleman her son, my friend, Occasioned my escape, by giving me A knowledge of my birth. His true relation Can vindicate me from suspicion. Car. I need it not: Were you not she (as I believe you are) And mean of birth, I should account my self A gainer by you. Sir, you have done that Hath plac'd you in my heart among those friends For whose sakes I my life will sacrifice. Phi. My Lord, you do indebt me to your service: In your acquaintance I shall be most honour'd. Cle. Sir, if you please he will relate my Story. Car. By no means: keep it for your father, when You do disclose your self. But can you pardon Those incivilities I did commit When you was Anclethe? Cle. Wrong not your self: you did make more of me Then I deserv'd, or could. Car. But why, my sweet Cleanthe, would you not Let me know who you was before? Cle. Dear Sir, I saw how violent you was In your affection to my careless sister, And had no hope you would leave her for me: And (if you did obtain her) meant to do What my disastrous fate should prompt me to. Car. Sweetest of all your sex. Cle. But (if you never got her, and orecame Her obstinacy) to declare my self; If not (but Love had triumph'd in your fall) I'de not have liv'd to see your Funeral. Car. The Gods requite this goodness, and make me worthy Of you, my dear Cleanthe; I contract My self upon your lips: which we will perfect Ere you own publikely your Father, for The enmity will make him charge you otherwise. Cle. I pray you let us. Car. A thousand thanks, come shall we walk (fair Mistress)? Cle. Conclusions fair the fates to them do give Who constant in their loves, and faithful live. Enter Falorus. Car. Stay, dear Cleanthe, here is my friend, he shall Partake my joy; well met my best Falorus. Fal. It seems you are not Tucapelo now: Where is Lucora? have you married her? Car. No, I have not, friend. Fal. Refrain: I am your enemy, embrace me not, Receive my sword, and peace this heart (Carionil.) Gives his sword. Car. He hath not yet descri'd you: Withdraw a little (dear Mistress) Sir, I pray you To bear her company, for who can tell What in this phrensie he may do? Exeunt Cle. Phy. Cle. Hereabouts we will await your leisure. Car. What ailes my friend? let me but know the man Is cause of this disorder in you, and He shall not see the gray-ey'd morning break From th' oriental Mountains any more: Let me partake of that unwieldy grief Hath bowd my friend so much beneath himself. Fal. Leave complements Carionil, and make A passage for my soul, that it may leave So vile a habitation as this body; And (when I'me dead) rip out my heart and in't Survey my fault, for I want words, and have Not impudence enough to tell it you. Car. O what might be the cause this matchless frame And worthiest Cabinet that ever man Inclos'd his secrets in, is so disturb'd! Noble Falorus, think to whom you speak, It is Carionil, whose life you do Make burthenous to him by the suspicion Of wronging him whom you have ever lov'd. Fal. You do deceive your self; I lately have Transgres'd against our league of amity: If you desire to be a happy man, And to enjoy what most you seek, be kind Unto your self, and run my body through. Car. Can I be happy and Falorus dead! No, I should live a desolater life Then ere the strictest Anchorite hath done, And wear my body to an Anatome, For real sorrow at such a dire mishap: Live then (my friend) and may you number daies Until Arithmetick grow faint, and leave you. Fal. You know not how much hurt you wish your self. Would you torment me twice? If not, forget Falorus utterly, and let me dye. Car. I understand you not. Fal. Would you have me blast my own fame by speaking My fault? And have me Executioner Unto my self? Car. Release your Soul of all her griefes, and say From whence your sorrows have original. Have you not oft told me of my impatiency? Give me now leave to be as plain with you: The angry winds never enrag'd the seas So much as some small grief hath done my friend. I do conjure you by our former loves (For sure not long since we were friends indeed) To let me know why you are thus distemper'd: I do not fear but I shall free you from This passion so precipitate and dangerous. Fal. You are most good, and get your self, Carionil, A name above the ablest character, None (like it) can decipher you; and would I alwayes had continued Falorus, Then I yet had remain'd your friend. But (if You needs will know the reason of my fury) Draw out the sword, that (when you have receiv'd it) Your hand, and not your words may strike me dead. Car. Be not importun'd longer; ease your heart: For (credit me) I grieve to see you thus. Fal. I am in love, suppose the rest, and kill me. Car. VVith Lucora? Fal. Too true, now curse me into dust, and with Your breath disperse me into aire: but spare me, Chide me not for my falshood, and inflict But one punishment on me, and be that the sword; Yet hear me speak one word or two before. I have not woo'd her, nor have sought performance Of that free promise that her father made me, But faithfully have temporiz'd with him; Nor did I willingly consent unto This passion, it did seise me violently. Car. Be you more calme, take her (Falorus) you have A liberty for me, I speak in earnest. Fal. Then all is well, return my sword (dear friend) Carionil, I will not hinder thee: Gives him his sword. My name shall not be blasted in thy sighes; Fall worthless man, tis pity I should live. Offers to kill himself. Car. VVhat mean you (my Falorus?) for heavens sake leave, And your own light rashly extinguish not: I for Lucora do not care, and have All my affection unto her recal'd, And am engag'd unto another Lady; I stole her from her chamber in my disguise, And then (bethinking me how she had us'd me) I told her that I would not have a Lady VVho would prefer a Moor before me. Her Slighting of me made me to leave her so. Fal. Is this not policy to delay my death? Car. If ere you found me false, believe me not. Fal. It then is true? Car. Most true, Falorus. Fal. Licence me (friend) now to embrace you; well met (Carionil) and welcomer indeed Then ever yet man was unto me: I Will live and owe my life unto you, and (when You please) I for your sake will lay it down: Freely I may Lucora now adore; And (rather then to lose her) I will try All waies that are contain'd in policie. Car. But say she never will consent? Fal. I am Most confident she will to please her Father: But (if she should not) I could suffer it; 'Twas not my Love made me thus passionate, It was because in it I wronged you. Car. Did you not marke (when you did see me first) A joy unusual sit upon my brow? Fal. I had so much of sorrow in my heart, That with it all my sences were possest. Car. But you perceiv'd I had left my disguise; What out of it did you collect? Fal. I thought Lucora had descri'd you, and you had A peremptory denial to your suit. Enter Cleanthe and Phyginois. Cle. Sir, seeing you had made a fair conclusion, And measuring each minute for an hour Until I were with you, I rudely come Uncal'd for to you. Car. Ever most welcome my Cleanthe; friend, This is the Lady I did mention to you, She was Anclethe, but is sister to The Mistress of your thoughts, and cal'd Cleanthe, Whom long since all her friends believed lost, And have these many years left mourning for. Fal. A strange discovery and admirable! Car. Some other time command the history; This mutually among our selves we'l spend. Fal. Lady, account me servant to your vertues, And you, Sir, may command Falorus alwaies. Phy. Your love will honour me (most noble Lord.) Cle. Sir, I for you will intercession make Unto my sister, and do hope shall prosper: I will make known how much you are her servant, And what affection my ears have witnessed; For I (unseen to you) did hear what pass'd. Fal. You will oblige me everlastingly. Car. Now let us walk. Fal. Whosoever loyal friendship doth regard, With fair events the Gods will him reward. Exeunt omnes. Scena quinta. Enter Iaques solus. Iaq. I have a Licence for my Lady, &amp; the brave gallant Master Lorece, But it cost too much a conscience, I wood a writ five times as much for halfe I gave for it: But t'is the fashion among great ones, so they have their wills they care not at how dear a rate they buy them. This marriage is like Christmas, when it comes it brings good cheer with't, we have fat Venison, hold belly hold: and wine I am sure we shall want none, for the Vintner had twenty pounds on me this morning. I ha bespoke a merry company of Fidlers; O they are boon fellows! and there will be old dancing, for I mean to sweat my doublet quite through ere I leave. Enter Lorece and Vandona. Madam, her'es the License your Worships sent me for, the Parson and this will make all sure. Lor. Tis well done Iaques, for this, be thou the Neptune of the Cellar, raise a tempest, and drown whoever doth go down the staires; Like old Silenus behave thy self. Van. When we have din'd, lets go to my Lord Polidacres, and invite that house. Lor. We will (my dear Widow.) Iaq. Twill be a merry time I see. Exeunt Omnes. Scena sexta. Enter Polidacre, Lucora, Antiphila, and Nentis. Ant. I wonder we have not seen the Ethiopian Lord today. Pol. He'l not be long absent. Lucora, thou hast my heart for thy consent: Falorus is a worthy Gentleman, And one of an approved fashion, He doth deserve a Princess; my Lucora, I know his nature is most noble, else I would not move thee for him, and (although The time is not expir'd) will you steal So much from age, and be his wife? I long To see thee well bestow'd. Luc. VVhat ere you please t'command I will perform. Enter Falorus. Pol. Here is Falorus! welcome my Lord, I shall Shortly say my son; my daughter I have won, And when I please, unto you she will give Away her self. Fal. You are most noble: But can you (fairest Lady) look so low As is Falorus? can there be such a vertue Of rare humility within you, that You thus confer affection upon me? Luc. My Lord, my father desires to make me yours; And I have learnt so much obedience, As willingly to do what he commands. Fal. I wish I could (most excellent Lucora) Thanke you in all the languages are worth Your dear attention, you have made me so Exceeding happy, I envy not his wealth That ownes the inhaustible mines of fam'd Peru. Luco. I thank you for this love, and have a hope Requite you Sir. Fal. My joy hath dul'd my senses. Enter Lorece, Vandona, and Jaques. Lor. Now brother! have I not ended happily? Vandona is my own: We onely want The ceremony Eclesiastical. My Lord, I am your servant. Fal. I have a Mistris got, the richest beauty Great Brittain ever was renowned for. Lor. Much, very much y faith; have you won her For whom hopeful Carionil did dye? Fal. I won her not (Lorece) her fathers desire Meeting with her consent, have made her mine. Van. Sister, you have been a stranger to me, I pray you be not so. Nen. You shall see me oftner. Lor. Thou maist be Mercury, and I will glory Thou art my brother. Van. Madam, I'm very glad to meet you here. Ant. And I as joyful of your company. Enter Carionil, Cleanthe, and Phygionis. Lor. Wonders! Carionil's alive again, and here. Pol. For some strange end he did give forth his death: But what yong beauteous Ladie's that? Luc. It is a face worthy of admiration. Pol. Rise Lady: kneel not unto me. She kneels. Cle. Then I were most unfit to be your Child. Pol. How! my daughter that was lost? Clea. Yes my Lord, and beg your blessing. Pol. May the good heavens make of thee (my daughter) (If you be she) an old and happy woman. Luc. I am a Sister to you: Spare some time For me to shew how much I do rejoyce At this unlook'd for good: none of your kin (Fair Sister) are more glad then I to see you, Whom we had never hope to see: I am Most proud to be alli'd unto So excellent a creature as you are. Clea. I am most joyful of your love. Ant. We are most glad to see you safe. Van. As if you were our Sister. Clea. My thanks (sweet Ladies) Pol. Dearest Cleanthe, confirm thy father in His joy: relate thy life, that out of it I may grow confident thou art my daughter. Phy. Lady, leave that to me: My Lord (and if You with her silence can so long dispence) I would do that. Clean. He is my Nurses Son, to whom (my Lord) I owe all thanks for my escape. Pol. Sir, when you please you may begin. Nen. What, not a gentleman! I am undone, But must be secret in't. âAside. Phy. My Lord. This Ladies Nurse, my mother, had a Sonne Older then the Lady Cleanthe is by seven years; Whom she did love so extraordinarily, That for his sake she foulely er'd from vertue: She thought it was an easie thing for her (If that their lives attained to those years) To make your daughter wife unto her son; Which is the cause she privily escap'd. Pol. Most strange! Phy. By chance I heard this of my brother, who Told me (against my mothers strict command) What a great marriage he should have, and that Cleanthe was the daughter of a Lord, Your Honours child, Whom all we thought but of a mean descent: (For she had won the country to believe That she did find her in the open field:) I pittying her hard chance, did tell her all, And promis'd her I would attend upon her, Until she had her parents happy made With knowledge of her safety. Cle. The rest I must relate: Dear Sir, be kind, and (if I have done ought You shall dislike) pardon my first offence; I was no sooner come to town, but saw This noble Gentleman, with whom so violently I fell in love, that for his sake (pray pardon me) My own apparel I did lay away, And did become his Page: And (when I did Disclose my self) he kindly did requite me. In brief we are contracted, I did not well without you to do thus; But your forgiveness, Sir, I cannot doubt: He told me that there was a difference Between our families, and therefore you (If your consent was ask'd) would never yield. Iaq. Wood I were it'h Cellar, I care not for these drie and tedious tales. Pol. Whether I should or no I cannot tell, But I am glad that it hath chanced thus; This match an ancient discord will conclude, And may the Gods be favourable to it. Car. Most Worthy Lord, my faithful thankes. Phy. Here also is a ring which by Your Father (my Lord Falorus) was given her, When at the Font he for her answer'd; She wo'rt about her neck when she was stolne. Pol. I know it well, and am confident Thou art my lost Cleanthe: Be his wife, And may the heavens make up the match most fortunate. Carionil, I now am glad I have A man so honour'd to my son in law. Car. My Lord (if that I can perform my will) You never shall repent your daughters choice. Pol. I do not doubt I shall. Now I would know Why your death was reported. Car. I was in love long which your eldest daughter, The fair Lucora, but could never win her; Brought almost to despair I did assume The habit and colour of a Negro. Pol. Then you was Tucapelo. Car. I was indeed: Knowing she had refus'd the greatest Marriages, And many of the handsomest of the Kingdome, I fully did believe she never would Like any man of this Complexion, And therefore feign'd my self an Ethiopian. But first gave out my death, and that unto My self I had done violence, for her. Luc. Surely, he will not do so unworthily As to make mention of my fond affection. Aside. Car. But all could not prevail. Luco. I am glad he ends so. âAside. Cario. And therefore I desisted wholly: which when Anclethe saw (my sweet Cleanthe now) She did disclose her self. Polid. I do perceive the Heavens intended you Should reconcile our Families. Iaq. Her's love, and love agen: I wood some body would love me. Luco. My dear Sister, you must not think me rude Because I do express my love so fully. Poli. Be my Carionil; All that are mine respect this Lady: For I do intend to make her so. Car. We are her Servants, and most joyfully Shall kneel unto a Lady of her vertues. Enter Philander, and Rosinda. Fal. What Lady's that? Car. She's masked, and I cannot guess. Pol. Philander, this Lady is thy Sister, the lost Cleanthe. Phi. Grow not to weak, my body, to contain My soul within thee at these joyes: Fair Sister, I am glad that I can name So beauteous a Lady as you are so; For you the heavens be thanked. Pol. Carionil's alive, and must be styl'd your brother, Cleanthe him hath chose: Perfect thy joyes (Philander) when thou wilt, And hear their Histories; This Lady you must call mother. Phil. But I must not. Poli. How! Phil. This here I will; Dear mother, now confirm my words. Unmaskes. Poli. Welcome to life Rosinda: Thy face and beauty I do remember well: But wherefore did you Raise the report of your untimely death? Rosin. That at a fitter time. This give me leave To spend in joy. My dear Cleanthe (for I do believe Because thy father doth acknowledge thee, Thou art Cleanthe my so long lost daughter) Never was mothers heart so light; I cannot Utter my joyes, my tears must witness them. To time I am indebted, that he hath Spared my life untill I see thee safe. Cle. I want expression: But my life shall be A comment on my heart, wherein you shall Perceive what your Cleanthe is. Phil. Now you are mine (fair Antiphila.) Ant. I will perform my promise. Phil. Both your consents I begge. Polid. How's this! Anti. I did engage my self, That (if I were not yours) I would be his. Pol. Then may the knot prove happy, and continue A firm one, while the Gods do lend you breath. Ros. It is my wish. Pol. Was you her servant too? Wife, chide me in secret, I was forsworn. Ros. We all are frail; Mortality may boast Of strength, but many conclusions deny it. Nen. Away, I will have none of you, I will not begge. Pol. You shall not need, I (for his love and care Unto my daughter) will give him means befitting A Gentleman, which shall descend unto His posterity, poverty shall not spoil his fortune. Vandon. 'Tis nobly said, If you do like him, take him sister. Ment. Now I'm content. Phyg. My joy is great: My thanks (sweet Mistriss) My Lord Polidacre, I am your grateful, though unworthiest servant. Now, Mistriss, you shall know the policy I won your affections with; my affections being setled so high, and I poor, I made my self, Draculemion; But your promise, worthiest Lord hath now enriched me. Iaq. O me! Was you that merry fellow? you have a parlous wit. Phyg. One thing I must crave of you. Polid. You shall obtain Sir. Phyg. That you will pardon my Mother. Polid. I do for your sake. Luco. Since I perceive you in the bounteous way Of granting Boons, Sir, I assume the boldness To become a Petitioner to you. Polid. My dear Lucora freely ask, for I Doubtlessely shall consent to thy demand. Luco. Seeing the gracious Heavens have blessed our house With the recovery of my long lost Sister; And since the powers divine have link'd her heart To the affections of a noble Gentleman; A marriage like to grace your honour'd Age With hopeful Nephews; I humbly crave your licence To enjoy the freedom of a single life; For I've no inclination to become A subject unto Hymens glorious bondage. Polid. Remember (my Lucora) all your promises, And suffer not your obstinacy to cloud The happiness of this Evening. Falor. My excellent Mistris, you have rais'd me neer The Zenith of all happiness, and will you Now leave me on that mighty precipice, To fall into a sad Abyss of misery? Clean. My dear sweet Sister, give me leave to trouble you With a few words aside; I saw the Lord Falorus for your sake (Between a great affection and firme friendship) In as high a passion as you can imagine. A noble and a faithful Lover to you; He in his soul adores you, I am confident; And I'm obliged by promise to become His Intercessor for your kind affection: I do beseech you therefore grace your Sister (Though bold, being younger, to importune you thus) T' honor the Lord Falorus with your Love. Lucor. I dare not (my fair sister) be so cruel As to deny you in your first request; I'le entertain his flame and be his Bride. I will be plain with you, had you been silent, In a ship bound for Spain I had gone to night With some Ladies of our neer kindred towards Lisbone, And so avoided the Courtship of Falorus, And all my Fathers continual importunities. To make this escape more unexpected, and The better to provide me for this journey, I had consented when my father pleas'd To marry him; but your intreaties have Prevail'd above all my resolutions. Falor. Dear Madam, let me beseech your assistance. Rosin. My Lord, I will desire her, and am confident I shall obtain. I pray thee (my Lucora) Submit to the intreaties of thy friends, And let not thy refusal of Falorus Beget a sad look on this happy evening. Lucor. Madam, you and my sister shall overcome; And though (my Lord Falorus) you may taxe me For an obstinate disposition, you shall find me Throughout my future dayes) to made amends, And prove a very loving wife unto you. Falor. Now you have fixed me in a fortunate And glorious life. Polid. I thank thee my Lucora. Iaq. Every body has his Sweetheart but I; one or other take pity on me, and let me not be a Cypher and stand here for nothing. I see the fault is in my years, otherwise Serving-men are not so slighted by Ladies. To the Spectator Ladies. Polid. Let us withdraw; you all Shall suppe with me to night, and we'l design The happy day that shall each couple joyn. Cario. You that have Mistrisses, do not despair To get them, be they nere so proud and fair; One way or other (you have seen it done) The obstinatest Lady may be wone. Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue. Lucora. The obstinate Lady yet is obstinate, And (careless either of your love or hate) She dares continue so: Nor will I beg Some friend within to come with his low leg, And's hat in's hand to woe your praise: It is So poor, that I had rather hear you hiss. Our Poet bad's be bold, For's Play was good, And that t'would take, if it was understood; And so we are: For what's our fate we must And will endure, be't lawful, or unjust. Unto your justice we appeal, which lies Within your hands: Do what you please, and rise. Cleanth. O sister! This is likely to spoil all: Gentle Spectators, also give me leave. Ladies and Gentlemen, if we have said Ought that hath pleas'd your ears, or pastime made, Our time we have spent well: but if that we Have tedious been, and you did sit and see With weariness, our Poet will repent That you this Comedy we did present. Y'ave paid the Actors wel, we thank you, &amp; know it, And wish that you would gratifie our Poet: He wants no money as the case now stands, Yet prayes you to be liberal of your hands. FINIS.</field>
