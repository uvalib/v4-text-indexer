      <field name="fulltext">THE EVNVCH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argvment. A citizen of Athens dwelling at Sunium a port-towne of Attica hauing two children, Chremes a Sonne, and Pamphila a daughter, had his daughter stolne away by Pyrats when she was of such tender age that she could onely tell her owne and parents names. After this the Athenian died. The Pyrats sold the child to a Merchant of Rhodes, who gaue her to a Strumpet which he loued. This Harlot had a daughter called Thais, somewhat elder then Pamphila: Which children she so brought vp together, that all men of Rhodes did repute them for Sisters. Thais in processe of time tooke to her mothers trade of life; and yeelding vp her selfe to a strangers deuotion, was by him caried to Athens; where he dying left her good means. He thus dead, she was taken vp by one Thraso a souldier: he also hauing a while accompanied her, had occasion of trauaile into Caria. Meane while the mother of Thais died at Rhodes: Her goods fell to a brother, who (with them) exposed to sale the abouenamed Pamphila, iust vpon the time wherein the soldier passed that way. Her youth and beautie induced the souldier (ignorant of all passages) to buy her, as a fit gift to bestow on Thais at his returne to Athens. But she before that time (whores do not liue in expectation, nor vpon the meanes of one man onely) had intertaind the loue of one PhÃ¦dria a young gentleman, sonne of an ancient Athenian Citizen. She also had by this time gained some inkling of the parentage of Pamphila, and that one Chremes a genteleman of Athens was in good likelihood naturall brother to the maiden: for better discouery whereof, she had had conference with him (aloofe off) touching the matter. The souldier returnes to Athens bringing Pamphila along with him, (her maiden-head is questiond by Terence, Act. 1. Sen. 2. in these words etiamne amplius? To auoid matter vnfitting for the grace of the Comedie, but she was (beyond any contrarie supposable coniecture) a maiden: for a child might fillip this souldier out of his courage; and foolerie was all the allurement he could vse to her) and being thus returned, he finds PhÃ¦dria entred into Thais her bookes: out of which if he be not cleane wiped, Pamphila is not for her, as the souldier affirmeth. Trence hath set out this Thais as none of the worst of that course of life; and withall of good discretion in her cariage. A Dilemma is now put vpon her; loue and consideration are the two hornes: she must venture the goring by one of them. Loue pleades first, and this is naturall to her bloud; and PhÃ¦dria besides deserues it. I but hee may be tendered a wife; his appetite cloyd his father worke her displeasure. Resolute loue in spite of these premisses hath set downe the c?clusion On the other side a reputed sister, that sister hath good friends, those friends able to strengthen her vnsetled fortunes; if by her meanes the one be restored to the other: Thus pleades Consideration. Wisely therefore she keepes the middle way for barring PhÃ¦dria her company for abrace of dayes (telling him why) she aimes to gull the souldier of the wench by this courtesie; and then to recall PhÃ¦dria to his former contentment. PhÃ¦dria assents, leaues the Citie, giues withall charge to Parmeno his fathers man, for bringing an Eunuch to Thais in his absence: PhÃ¦dria gone, Thraso also sends Pamphila to her by Gnato a Parasite. In the passing of the maiden thither, ChÃ¦rea a younger brother of PhÃ¦dria spies her, falles in loue with her, dogges her, by accident looseth her, chafes with himself at it: then to Parmeno comming vpon him, discouers his mind and whereto caried. Parmeno informes him of an Eunuch by his brother PhÃ¦dria sent, and by him forthwith to be conueied to the very house where the maid abideth. So that by shifting cloathes with the Eunuch he may vndiscouered be brought to her; the Eunuch nor hee hauing euer before beene seene by Thais or any of her family ChÃ¦rea followes the aduise, is brought thither, rauisheth the maiden. Much coyle hence ariseth, Pamphila at length being found to bee free-borne, ChÃ¦rea marries her; Thais is taken into protection by the father of the two brothers. The Souldier for mirth and cost sparing is admitted among them, by Gnatoes perswasion, with the consent of PhÃ¦dria.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Actors and their Characters. Senex, an old man not named by Terence; father of two sonnes: himselfe being retired to his Countrey Grange, at his returne to the Citie findes that either of his sonnes haue playd Rex in his absence: his nature suddaine and fiery. PhÃ¦dria one of his sonnes, a young man intangled with the loue of a harlot: well qualified and stragling with his faultie inclination. ChÃ¦rea, Another of the old mans sonnes, an early Cocke of the game: the heate of his youthfull bloud violently caries him on to a rape: either he was passed an Ephebus, or Grammarians mistaken in the word, or else Terence hath beene very bold in the part of ChÃ¦rea lustfull, heady, head-strong. Parmeno, Seruant of the family, wise and discreat while he giues aduise; when he vndertakes imployment diligent and faithfull. Thais, A strumpet of a sweete and pleasing disposition: gracefull in language, in maners free and indifferently modest. Terence (in a word) hath striued in her person to set out a tollerable harlot. Pythias maid to Thais. A busie pratling house-wife. Dorias another of her maides, of cleane contrary temper: an idle meacocke. Chremes, A young countrie gentleman. Clownish of maners, very timerous and fearefull. Sophrona an old nurse, she hardly huddles ouer the stage: And all the newes I heare fr? her, is this one word, Mouco. Antipho a young gentleman of good demeanor, familiar. Thraso. &amp; Gnato. couple: for what good Musique makes a trumpet without its ecco. The first a Parat, th'other a fellow clawing his poll. The souldier a bragging sot, of necessitie therefore a Cowheard; the other a Clawbacke rubbing his proud itch. The Parasite thus farre wise, that he can make vse of his foolish Master: for he pickes matter of mirth and meanes out of him. Sanga a Cooke, by consequence inclining to sawcinesse. Malepert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. If there be any who their studies frame To giue good men contentment, displease none; In their faire rancke our Poet files his name: If any further hold opinion, That harsh vnciuill tearmes to procure shame To any man, be here vngently sowne; Let him thinke so a Gods name: but with all He lets them know, what euer words do passe, Do not on such as free inuectiues fall; But forc'd replies of him first wronged was: To vtter the mans name not neede I shall: One, shrewdly tossed, leaudly glossed has Many Greeke comedies: and by that meane In that tongue good, in Latine marred cleane. Twas he who but ere-while presented you Menanders Phasos. to name it is inough: But in the Treasure, there you saw him shew rare workemanship, exceeding his rich stuffe. One man another for found gold did sue: (Our Orators are but a glimmering snuffe To this bright Poets shining Oratory.) Now in that case iudiciously he wrought The partie at the barre, then defensorie, To plead first, for the gold inquestion brought; Before the plaintiffe vrgd his iniurie; or reason shewd why he by action sought Recouerie of that gold: or how the same into the tombe of his dead father came. I wish him henceforth, he himselfe not flatter; Or thinke (his plates being passd) he stands secure This will be vnsafe refuge for the matter I haue against him: which (I him assure) Is kept in store: and (cease he not to scatter His tales abroad our scandall to procure; As he begins; and leaue to vrge vs on) Yet husht shall be produc'd to publique view. This Eunuch now a foote for action Being by the Ãdiles bought, he hard did sue, To be at sight of the relation. The Ouerseers come, the Actors drew To the rehearsall. I beseech you now, But heare, what he hath challenged and how, My man baules out in roare, a pilferer No Poet hath now tenderd you a play: And yet in all the same, no one word neither Of's owne, for's money tenderd. Why, I pray? Why out of NÃ¦uius, Plautus (chuse you whether) All is purloind that you shall heare to day. And going on, the enuious point he plies; That this is stale stuffe in each author named: That either of them in their Comedies The souldier and flatterers part haue framed: And that both thence are hither brought he cries. Which, if't be such a fault as must be blamed; Our Author sayes disknowing led him on: No purpos'd filching practise thought vpon. That this is so, may by you straight be tride: Menanders Flatterer hath a Parasite, Which Colax called is; there is beside A braggart Souldier: that he did indite Those personages thence is not denide, To fill his Eunuch: but that he did wyte The Eunuch was neuer before produced in Latine. That this had euer beene the argument Of Latine play before he vtterly Denyes. If this now be so insolent, To assume the persons vsed formerly By other Poets; why is suffrance lent To frame a seruant running hastely? To fashion harlots wonton? matrons chaste? Souldiers to vant? parasites cramming fast? Why of false children are drabbes brought to bed? Why the old Master cheated by his slaue? Why are not loue, hate, iealousie yet dead? There is no sentence (to conclude) we haue, Which hath not formerly beene vttered. It is but reason therefore, if we craue Notice be tane; and our course pardoned: If what in precedent the ancients gaue, New Poets modestly haue followed. Pray lend your fauor, and attentiue eare; That you our Eunuches newes may fully heare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. Scen. 1. Enter PhÃ¦dria and Parmeno. PhÃ¦. VVhat should I then resolue on? not to go? Not now at least, being so kindely sent to? Or rather this way bend, my setled course, Not to indure these scornefull trickes of Whores? She shut me out of doores; now sends for me: Go? neuer I, should she sue earnestly. Par. Sir, surely if you can do as you say, Twere your most worthy, your most manly way. But if beginning, you so go one, And faintly bearing loues affliction, When y'are not sought to, when you are at square Shall then come creeping to her; and declare Your ardent loue, whose flames you cannot beare; You are cast in Law, you may goe shake the care. You are gone: shall be her pipe to play vpon, When you are found at her deuotion. And therefore master timely yet consider, That such a thing as holdeth in it neither Reason, nor measure; such vnruly thing Cannot be brought to reasons gouerning. In loue these vitious humours setled are; Suspicious, wrongs, enmities, truces, warre, New league againe: Now this vncertaintie To draw to certaine, were like mistery, As if one should a proiect venture on To make a man mad with discretion. And what you now here to your selfe in passion Do vtter, shall I brooke this base queanes fashion? Who hugges yon'd souldier? barres her doore on me? Not caring? Ile die first: Shee yet shall see What manner man she has to do withall. These your high words, these hot tearmes tragicall With one false teare sheel allay easily; Which (rubbing of her eyes most pittifully) She hardly shall force from 'hem: and anon Youle tender your owne accusation, And stoop to her set penance. PhÃ¦. Oh my hard fate! I clearely find my selfe vnfortunate; And her a wicked strumpet. I do frie In flames of loue to one I loathing flie: Knowing and seeing fall; aliue, awake: Nor see my course. Par. To what course should you take, But seeke to gaine your libertie now lost, At what low rate you may? if little cost Will not procure it, then at th'utmost price; And do not vex your selfe. PhÃ¦. That thy aduise? Par. If you be wise, and to loues miserie Ad not: what'thas, striue to beare moderately. Enter Thais. But she comes foorth; our householdes knowne decay. For what we ought to haue, she sweepes away. Scen. 2. Tha. VVoes me, I feare PhÃ¦dria hath tane it hard And worse then I did meane it, he was bard His entrance here last day. PhÃ¦. Oh Parmeno, How I do shake and shudder euery part At sight of her. Par. I pray Sir take good heart. Approach that fire, youl be warmd thoroughly. Tha. Who's that? oh, were you my PhÃ¦dria so nigh? Why staid you here? why entred not straight way? Par. But nere a word of's shutting out last day. Tha. Why art silent? PhÃ¦. Yes indeed I confesse Your house is still ope to my free accesse: And I the fan'rite. Tha. Pray no more of this. PhÃ¦. Why no more of it? Ã´, Ã´, Thais, Thais, I would our loues were like; that this might thee equally trouble, as it troubles me; Or that I could not weigh thy iniurie. Tha. I prithee sweete heart PhÃ¦dria do not grieue. Troth twas not that I loue any aliue More then thy selfe, I did it but the case (As things sell out) so to be carried was. Par. Why, I beleeue her; as things came about, The poore kind soule for meere loue shut him out. Tha. Say you so Parmeno? Leaue that: and heare Wherefore I now sent for you. PhÃ¦. Well. I heare. Tha. But pray say first, can this your man keepe counsell? Par. Who, I? exceeding well. But heare you Thais? I passe my word to you, with this prouiso, All truth I heare I hold in exlently: If lie, or toy, or fable, out it goes: I'm full of chinckes then, I leake euery where: If therefore youl haue counsell kept, speake truth. Tha. My mother borne at Samos, dwelt at Rhodes. Par. This may be well conceald. Tha. There a merchant Bestowed a little girle vpon my mother, Stolne hence from Athens. PhÃ¦. Was the child freeborne? Tha. I thinke so; do not know the certainty. Her selfe did tell father and mothers name; Country or other signes to be knowne by. She knew not; nor indeede was't possible By reason of her tender age she should. The Merchant thus much added, that he heard The Pirats say of whome he bought the child, That it was brought from Sunium. My mother Hauing receiu'd it, bred it, taught it so In euery thing, as if't had beene her owne: And indeede most reputed her my Sister. Long after I left Rhodes, in company Of a then stranger, whom alone I kept to, And hither came. That stranger dying, gaue All the now goodes vnto me, which I haue. Par. Either of these is false, twill out. Tha. Why so? Par. Because that neither were you satisfied With him alone, nor yet had all from him: Good and great part of it, my Master brought you. Tha. I grant thee: but permit me to go on Whither I aime. Since that, a souldier Who had begunne to loue me, trauailed To Caria: after which I grew into Acquaintance with your selfe. And you well know. That I since then haue held you inwardly: Made you my bosomes onely Secretary. PhÃ¦. Neither will this be husht by Parmeno. Par. Ã´ do you make a doubt ont? Tha. Pray attend. My mother there at Rhodes deceased late, Her couetous brother, heire to her estate, Nothing the wench was faire, and skilled well In Musique; hop'd her at good rate to sell: So forth he brought her, sold her to my friend Who then there was; and fully did intend To giue the maid to me: Yet nothing knew Of all the passage I haue told to you. He comming home, and vnderstanding too, That in my loue you likewise haue to do, He frames excuses to keepe backe the maid. For (saies he to me) could he get beliefe That he in my accompt should be held chiefe, And you put by? or stood he not afraid I hauing got her from him, presently Would then forsake him; he would giue her me? But this he doubts. Yet I do rather guesse He fancies her. PhÃ¦. Has he yet done no more? Tha. No surely: for my selfe haue (PhÃ¦dria) Vpon that point sifted her narrowly. For many reasons I desire to get her; First for she's deemd my sister: then beside That to her friends I may the maid deliuer. My selfe do here a lonely woman bide, Hauing nor Kinsman here nor yet fast friend: Wherefore I seeke to winne some PhÃ¦dria, By this good turne, I to the wench intend. For my more ready working, I do pray Thy helpe deare heart. The manner of my plot Is, by your free consent for some few dayes He may inioy my loue. Answer you not? PhÃ¦. Oh woman wickedst of all thy race! Should I reply ought to thy filthy doings? Par. Ã´ our braue young Master! I commend him. He'es vext at length: now sir you are a man. PhÃ¦. The issue of the tale I could not find: Small girle stolne hence; my mammy as her owne Bred it; deemd sister; haue a childing minde To hea't; and to put it where tis knowne. Whereto doth this your tale now wheele about? But that thou loust me lesse then yonder loute, And iealous art thy sweete pigsme doos toute On her, thee of his greazie grace cast out? Tha. I iealous of it? PhÃ¦. What else troubles thee? Is he alone a giuer? didst ere see My bounty slight or slacke? when late you said You had a great mind to an Ãthiop maid; Did not I, laying all else care aside, Cast out for one? an Eunuch too beside Thou wishedst; cause great Ladies onely haue Such creatures; I found one; yesterday gaue Twentie pounds for'hem. Now despis'd by thee, I yet retaine this in my memorie: For these my kindenesses thou slightes me. Tha. Why speake you PhÃ¦dria in this angry manner? Though I desire her, and thinke may obtaine her Best this way: rather yet then haue a foe Of you, Ile do as you will haue me do. PhÃ¦. Would that word truly fr? thy heart were brought; Rather then me thy foe if I but thought That this was spoke without dissembling, I could my selfe frame to beare any thing. Par. How quickly one poore word hath tamed him? Tha. do I poore soule speake it dissemblingly? What thing did you ere craue though feastingly At my hand, but you had it? I of you Cannot obtaine leaue for a day or two. PhÃ¦. If onely two, and that if they prooue not twentie. Tha. Indeede but two, orâ PhÃ¦. Or I wait nothing. Tha. T shall be no more: pray yeeld this libertie. PhÃ¦. Well: Thais I must do as you will haue me. Tha. Deseruedly I loue you. PhÃ¦. Tis well done. Ile to the country, and there pine a lone For these two tedious dayes: I am resolued so. Thais must be obayd. You Parmeno See those brought hither straight. Par. Yes sir. PhÃ¦. Thais Farewell for two dayes. Tha. And you PhÃ¦dria. Command you all else? PhÃ¦. What else should I say? With this same souldier present absent be: Dayes nights thy loue, fixe thy desire on me: Thy longings, dreames, thy hopes, delights, and mind. Fix vpon me: be all with me: in fine Be thy soule mine, as mine is truly thine. Exeunt PhÃ¦dria and Parmeno. Tha. Woes me; perhaps he hardly credits me, But iudgeth me by other wantons trade: But I that best know my owne priuitie, Know I haue now no kinde of leazing made: And that I loue, no man more heartily Then PhÃ¦dria here: and that what I haue said Or done, is onely for to helpe the maide: I hope I haue well nigh discouered Who is her brother: a yong man well bred. He promised to visite me this day. Ile get me in, and for his coming stay: Exit Thais.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Scen. 1. Enter PhÃ¦dria and Parmeno. PhÃ¦. As I late bad, see those be hither brought. Par. I will. PhÃ¦. But carefully. Par. It shall be done. PhÃ¦, And speedily. Par. I Warrant you. PhÃ¦. Is this Sufficient? Par. Good God! What neede you aske so? Would you could find some good commoditie, As easily as all this will bee lost. PhÃ¦. My selfe, to my selfe dearer, am lost too. Do not so thwartly intertaine the charge. Par. No: but will see it done. Would you ought else? PhÃ¦. Grace this my present with what words thou canst And what thou canst, disgrace my riuall from her. Par. I had thought o'that, though you had not Mentiond it. PhÃ¦. Ile to the country, and there keepe. Par. I Iudge so. PhÃ¦. But hear'st? Par. What say'y? PhÃ¦. Dost iudge I may settle There to abide without returning backe, For all the time of my inioyned pennance? Par. You? troth I thinke not: either I imagine Youle pace againe backe to her presently; Or want o'sleepe ith' night will force you hither. PhÃ¦. Ile worke to wearinesse, that I may force sleepe. Par. Put this into your taske youle watch wearie. PhÃ¦. A way foole, thou talk'st idlely Parmeno: I sure must weede this my effeminate minde; My selfe I ouercoker. Can I not (If need should be) forbeare her company, Yea, for three dayes together. Par. Wonderfull! For three whole dayes? aduise sir what you do. PhÃ¦. The word shall stand. Par. Oh you good gracious gods! Exit PhÃ¦dria. What disease call you this? is it not strange That none should know him the same thing to be, That erst he was? who late more stay'd then he? More temperate? lesse vaine? but who comes here? Enter Gnato with Pamphila, and a waiting wench. How! troth tis the souldiers Parasite Gnato; who with him brings the maid along. As present vnto Thais. Oh rare sight! Sweete countenance! tis marle but I shall haue Course entertainement of her here to day With my decrepit Eunuch. Why her face Puts downe the Mistresse; Thais selfe doth passe. Scen. 2. Gna. Oh you immortall gods! how farre one man Outstrips another? and what difference is Twixt men of braine, and fooles? this argument Comes to my minde on this occasion. To day I met one, of my rancke and place; No niggard pinch-gut: but one, tooke delight To hauocke out his state in daintie morsels. I note him rugged, nastie, drooping growne; Beset with ragges and age. Why how now fellow, Say I to him, what does this dressing meane? Marrie, saies he, poore creature hauing lost All I enioyd, see to what state I am driuen? Acquaintance, friends, all do abandon me. Here I beganne (measuring my owne estate) To hold him in contempt; and schoole him thus: What, idle drone, hast thou so fram'd thy course That no hope's left thee? hast thou sent thy wits After thy wealth? doost not obserue me One of thine owne ranke and condition? What cloathing, coulor, neatnesse, plight of body Haue I? haue euery thing though nothing haue: And nought possessing, yet do nothing want. I but (sighes out my fellow) I poore caitife Cannot indure to be a ieasting stocke, Nor suffer stripes for money. What, I prithe (Reply I) should be gotten that way, thinkst? Thou art cleane wide: in former times, of old, Such kind of fellowes, shifted out a liuing: This a new way of birding found by me. There are a sort of men that faine would shew To haue rare parts; and yet are nothing so. I follow these; to these my selfe apply; Not to make them sporte by my foolerie, But my owne sport of them I smile on these, Withall admire their wits: what ere they please To say I do commend it: if straight way They do the very selfesame thing vnsay, I praise that too: ought say they, ought denie? The same I say, denie for company. In fine, I on my selfe impose this law: Their humors at all hands to sooth and claw: And this is now found the most thriuing way. Par. Troth a fine fellow: he of fooles mintes madmen. Gna. While thus we talke, we reach to th'market place: The ioyfull Victlers haste to meete me there; Fish-mungers, Butchers, Saulsagemakers, Cookes, And Fishermen: people to whom I had beene both beneficiall, while my state stood good; And since twas sunke: and still aduantage them. These me salute, inuite me home to dine: Do welcome me. The Hungerstarued fellow I nam'd, seeing the accompt men made o' me, And that I sai'd so well, so easily, Humbly besought me he might learne the made. I bade him follow that if 't may be wrought, Like as professed Philosophers haue sought To keepe their names vp in their sectaries, According to their doctrines qualities, Epicures, Cynickes, Stoickes, Platonickes: So these my followers be stil'd Gnatonickes. Par. Do you not note what ease and trusting to Other mens roast, may worke a man to do? Gna. Yet why thus loyter I, and not conuey This maid to Thais; and her further pray To come to supper? but sve Parmeno The souldiers Riuals seruant, at her doore. Hees melancholy: all's well. Sure the folke here Are frostie witted: I am now determind. To play vpon the foole. Par. By this their guift They thinke that Thais now's their owne cocke-sure. Gnat. Gnato does greete his chiefe friend Parmeno. With wishes of much health. What dost man? Par. Stand. Gna. I see't, but seest ought here does trouble thee? Par. Yes, thee. Gna. I do beleeue it; but ought else? Par. Why askst? Gna. Because y' are sad. Par. Not I truly. Gna. No, be not. But what thinks thou of this maid? Par. Thus you now meane, that we are cashierd hence. Las, all things suffer intercourse of change. Gna. Parm'no: for these sixe whole moneths together. Ile set thee at rest from trudging vp and downe Or watching to day breake: make I thee happie? Par. Me? wounderfully! Gna. So I vse my friends. Par. I do commend you for it. Gna. I detaine you: Perhaps you were to go some whither else. Par. No whither, I. Gna. Then I pray a little Lend me your furtherance: worke my entrance here. Par. Well sir go on. Your passage now lies faire By reason of this maid you bring with you. Gna. Would ye haue any cald to you out of th'house? Exit Gnato and Pamphila. Par. Let but two dayes be passed ouer once; And you that haue the happie readinesse With your least finger now to ope the doores, Ile make you many a time hereafter knocke And kicke your heeles against'hem to no purpose Enter Gnato. Gna. What do you still attend here Parmeno? Pray, are you plac'd there sentinell, to watch Least any priuate messenger should runne Betweene the souldier and Thais hither. Exit Gnato againe. Par. Conceitedly! but indeede they must be Things extraordinary, that may please Enter ChÃ¦rea. The souldier. But my Masters younger sonne I spie a coming hither: I do maruell What tis hath drawne him out of the Pyreum: For there at this time he is publique Custos. Tis not for nothing. And he com's in haste: And (why God knowes) his eyes about doos cast. Scen. 3. ChÃ¦. I am undone she's no where to be seene: And I that lost sight of her am lost too. Where may I search? where hunt? whom aske? what way Take? I haue no direction; but I haue this hope left Where ere she be, she cannot be long hid. Beautifull face! hence forward I do blot Out of the table of my fantasie All other women: and do fall to loath These common beauties. Par. Marke this yonker too! I know not what he talkes to himselfe of loue. Oh my most vnfortunate old master! Why this is such a hotspurre, if he take To wenching once, youle thinke his brothers course meere trickes and gambads in comparison Of what his furious rage will venture on. ChÃ¦. Oh all you gods and goddesses confound That same old dotard stay'd me on my way; Let them plague me too, that did deigne to stay: And further would not slight him. But behold Here's Parmeno: well met. Par. Why are you sad? Or about what so earnest? whither going? ChÃ¦. Troth I not know, nor whither, nor bout what; I am so vtterly beside my selfe. Par. Why how comes this? ChÃ¦. I am in loue man. Par. How? ChÃ¦. Now Parmeno make proofe, what dwels in thee. Thou knowst thou oftentimes hast promist me, Bidding me thinke of something I desired; And thou wouldst shew how thou couldst pleasure me. And this thou offerdst, when I secretly Brought to the seller all our victualls to thee. Par. Peace idlesbee. ChÃ¦. Now on my part tis sound What I desire let me thy promise find. Besides it is an action of that value, Whereon thou mayst spend thy best sweat and labor. This wench is nothing like our Citie Mammals, Whom their mothers striue to make low shoulderd; And lace hard in, to make 'hem appeare slender: If any grow a little fleshlier Sh's tearm'd a champion; straightway dieted: That be they of naturall temper ere so good, They tamper 'hem to forme of reedes or rushes: And therefore they are made much on. Par. What on yours? ChÃ¦. Face af a rare proportion. Par. Excellent! ChÃ¦. Colour her owne plumpe body; full of mettle. Par. Her yeares?? ChÃ¦. About sixteene. Par. The very prime. ChÃ¦. Procure her me by force stelth, or intreatie; I weigh not which way, so I may enioy her. Par. Of what condition is she? ChÃ¦. Troth I know not. Par. Of whence. ChÃ¦. Nor that. Par. Where dwels she? ChÃ¦. As little, that. Par. Where saw you her? ChÃ¦. Passing a long the street. Par. How lost? ChÃ¦. That was chafing with my selfe Iust now as I came hither: neither thinke I Ther's any liuing on, to whom good happes Offering well at first, do end more thwartly. Par. What mischiefe hath falne out? ChÃ¦. Oh me accurst! Par. Why, what's the matter? ChÃ¦. Aske thou? knowst thou not. My fathers kinsman, Archidemides? A man much of his yeares? Par. What else? ChÃ¦. Whil'st I Follow the maiden, he comes iust vpon me. Par. Vnseasonably o' my word. ChÃ¦. Nay verily Vnluckely. The word vnseasonable Fits other chances better Parmeno. I may sweare safe, this sixe or seuen moneths Last past, I nere happend to see the man; But now when least I would, or had lesse neede. Seemes it not strange, how thinkst thou? Par. Yes, y' faith. ChÃ¦. As distant as he was he huddled to me, Bow-bent, palsey-handed, blabber-lipt, cough-strangled: Ho, ho, stay, ChÃ¦rea (sayes he) ChÃ¦rea stay; ChÃ¦rea to thee I speake: knowes thou my errand? What is it, say I to him? marrieâmarrieâ And halfe an houre after gruntles to me I haue a triall to be heard to morrowâ And what of that, say I? he answers me see that thou tell thy father carefully, That he remember to be early ready To pleade my cause. This our dialogisme Tooke vp an houre of time, I askt what else? No more saies he. I left him; looking backward To spie the maid, she ith' meane time had turnd downe this way to our street. Par. Tis tenne to one But he meanes her, that was now brought to Thais. ChÃ¦. When I come hither, she's not to be seene. Par. Did any companie attend the wench? ChÃ¦. Yes, a Parasite and a maid seruant. Par. Tis she: Cast of your care: all now is quiet. ChÃ¦. Thou talkest from the purpose. Par. Nay, but minde the businesse now in hand: ChÃ¦. Say doost know her? or sawest her? Par. Saw, know her, know where she is? ChÃ¦. Oh my sweete Parmeno knowst her? Par. I do know her. ChÃ¦. And where she is? Par. Here, brought to the harlot Thais, And giuen her for a gift. ChÃ¦. Who is so potent To giue such gifts? Par. Thraso the souldier, Your brother PhÃ¦dria's riuall. ChÃ¦. Thou declar'st But a hard case my brother stands in then. Par. Yould say so indeede, if you had seene the present Which he prouides to send in counterpoise. ChÃ¦. Prithe, what ist? Par. An Eunuch. ChÃ¦. What, that driule, That filthy fellow he brought yesterday? The old man-woman? Par. I, the very same. ChÃ¦. Hele be coited out o'doores with's present. But I nere knew, this Thais was our neighbour Par. She has not long beene. ChÃ¦. I'm a fellow of nothing. Strange, I should nere haue seene her? but doost heare? Is she so faire, as she's reported for? Par. Yes sure. ChÃ¦. But not to be compar'd to mine? Par. Tis otherwise. ChÃ¦. I prithe Parmeno Worke that I may obtaine her. Par. Ile see toot: Ile studie for your furtherance and helpe. Command you me ought else? ChÃ¦. Whether now go'st thou? Par. Home; to conuey those seruants vnto Thais. As late your brother chargd me. ChÃ¦. Oh blessed Eunuch! Who is to be there placed in that house. Par. Wherein so blest? ChÃ¦. Wherein, demandest thou? That euer has so faire a fellow seruant To looke on; talke to; vnder the same roofe Be still with her; sometimes take meales with her? Sometimes sleepe nigh her? Par. What if now your selfe May be made happie? ChÃ¦. Wherein Parmeno? Par. Say. Tak's clothes ChÃ¦. His clothes? what thence Will follow? Par. Ile lead y'in 'stead. ChÃ¦. I note. Par. Ile say y'are hee. ChÃ¦. I apprehend thee Par. You may then enioy The benefits, which now you said he should; be present, eate, touch, play, and lie close by her: Seeing none of'hem do know you, what you are. Beside your face and yeares are such, you may Passe easilie for an Eunuch. ChÃ¦. Excellent. I neuer in my life heard better counsell. Let's in; and helpe to dresse me presently. Leade me, carrie me, with all speede thou canst. Par. What mean'st? troth I but ieasted. ChÃ¦. Thou wast's time in prating. Par. I haue cast my selfe away. What haue I done wretch? whither thrust you me? Will you now force me? Sir I warne you stay. ChÃ¦. Let's goe. Par. Persist you? ChÃ¦. I am fully bent toot. Par. Foresee, if th'course be not to hot for vs. ChÃ¦. Tis not I warrant thee, let's on. Par. I, but This beane will sure be threshed on my shoulders. Oh tis a hainous practise we attempt. ChÃ¦. A hainous figge: is that a hainous practise, If I be brought in a baudie house, And there returne their owne vpon these gibets And plagues of men? which alwayes hold our youth In such contempt, and alwayes worke our torment? If I do now put a like tricke vpon 'hem, As we by them are still guld? or else rather Ist fit, we still take their wronges patiently? I say tis fit I put the ieast vpon her. Who'l blame me that shall heare on't? euery man Will say, I fitted 'hem a peniworth Par. What meanes all this? If you be so resolu'd You may go on. But pray you sir hereafter Lay not the fault on me. ChÃ¦. I will not. Par. You Command me then? ChÃ¦. Command, charge and compell. Par. Ile nere (decline then) your authoritie. Exeunt Parmeno and ChÃ¦rea. Follow. ChÃ¦. The powers diuine prosper our course.</field>

Exeunt Thraso, Thais and her traine. Scen. 3. Enter Chremes. Chr. The more I do reuolue things in my minde Still the more likely arguments I find That Thais here aimes some shrewd tricke against me; I see she workes on me so cunningly. When first she sent for me (if any one should then haue askt me the occasion Of businesse twixt vs twaine, I knew no thing To Answer) being come, with hammering She fashiond out pretences of my stay: She had performd religious rites that day Vnto the gods, and would communicate A Weightie secret to me: (I then straight Grew iealous, all this was some cunning straine) She sits downe by me; cause of talke doth frame I seeming cold, her speech to this point came, How long 'twas since my Parents had beene dead? Long since I told her: then she questioned If I had land at Sunium? and how farre It lay from sea? this (I thinke) liketh her: She hopes to worke it from me. at the last She drew to this, if I had no young sister From that place stolne a many yeares now past? Who then was with her at the time we mist her? What things she had about her? or if any Could know her? why should she these questions moue? vnlesse (as is the impudence of many) She faine her selfe would that my sister prooue, Of old so young hence lost? should she suruiue, Her yeares at most reach not aboue sixteene; Thais is elder then my selfe, I weene. She crau'd me againe come to her: let her driue The matter, and her business to some head; Or leaue this sending: ile not be troubled, To listen her third errand. Ho, withinâ Enter Pythias to her Mistresses doore. Pyth. Who's that? Chr. One Chremes. Pyth. Oh fine little pleasant pate. Chr. I still affirme, I am laid for to be catcht. Pyth. Thais did earnestly request you would Returne to morrow. Chr. I go into the Country. Pyth. Pray y' Chr. I say I cannot. Pyth. Then remaine here A while till she come backe. Chr. No by no meanes. Pyth. Why my kind Chremes? Chr. Hence you harlotrie Pyth. If such be your determination, I pray step ouer to her where she is. Chre. I care not if I do. Pyth. Dorias go straight And leade this gentleman to his souldiers. Pythias returnes into her Mistresses house. Dorias enters and go away with Chremes. Scen. 4. Enter Antipho. Ant. Some youthes of vs agreed on yesterday A feast in Comon mongst vs: ChÃ¦rea We made our Steward; rings were giuen; time, place Set downe; time's past; where it appointed was Nothing is ready; he not to be seene; I know not what to say ont, what to weene. Now all the rest haue laid the taske on me To seeke him; therefore now Ile first go see If he be gotten home. But who is that Comes out of Thais house? is't he or not? Enter ChÃ¦r. in the Eunuches cloathes. Tis he. What creature's he become? what meanes This his attire? what euill bodes his staring? I cannot enough wonder, or coniecture. But what so ere it be, Ile aloofe stand; And angle for the secret now in hand. Scen. 5. ChÃ¦. Is none about the doores? Not one. Doos none Come yet behind me neither? No not one. May I not now at pleasure vent my ioy? Oh Iupiter! now truly is the time I easilie could brooke to part with life: Least some insuing wretchednesse thereof Should hap to soure my present happinesse. No curious inquisitor now meete me? That vp and downe would hant me, wearie me, Kill me with tedious questions, why I skippe thus? Why am so iocund? Whither I am going? Or whence do come? in what place got these clothes? What is my ayme? whither Ime mad or sober? Ant. Ile to him, and obtaine the thankes of him He so desires to part with. ChÃ¦rea, Why in such rapture man! whence this attire? Why art so pleasant? or what aymst thou at? Art in thy wits? Why starest thou so vpon me? Why speak'st not? ChÃ¦. Oh happie day? Ã´ friend well met. There's no man liuing, I would rather see At this time then thy selfe. Ant. I prithee, say What is the matter! ChÃ¦. Nay truly I pray thee Giue me the hearing. Know'st thou not her here My brother is in loue withall? Ant. Yes Thais: As I do guesse. ChÃ¦. The same. Ant. So I remember. ChÃ¦. A certaine maid was giuen her to day. What need I blazon or set out to thee This maidens matchlesse beautie, Antipho? Thou knowest me choise in such disciphering. She did inflame my heart. Ant. What saist? ChÃ¦. thou'lt say She from the whole sex beares the Bell away, If euer thou shalt see her. What neede words? I gan to loue her: by good chance there was At home an Eunuch which my brother had bought for this Thais, not then sent to her. Here our man Parmeno an odde inckling gaue me Of a deuice, which quickly I laid hold on. Ant. What ChÃ¦. If you would silent keepe, you would Know sooner. First to change cloathes with him, then cause my selfe To be conueyed for him. Ant. What for the Eunuch? ChÃ¦. Yes. Ant. What aduantage shold you winne thereby? ChÃ¦. Mak'st thou a question? I should see, should heare, Should be with her I loued, Antipho. Was it a slight cause, or a trifling reason? I was brought to her; when she had receiued me She gladly led me home: commits the maidâ Ant. To whom? To thee? ChÃ¦. To me. Ant. a sure safeguard. ChÃ¦. She chargeth me that no man come to her; Commands me further, I not start from her; But that alone I keepe with her alone, In a close chamber: I say, yes forsooth; Vpon the ground looking demurely: Ant. Caitise. ChÃ¦. I am to go now foorth (saies she) to banquet And with her leades along her maiden seruants, (A few young nouice wenches left behind To attend vpon the maid) these presently Prepare for her to Bathe. I wish them haste While they make things in readinesse, the maid Sits in a closet, looking on a table: Wherein was painted, how that Iupiter Once ray'nd in Danaes lappe a golden showre. I look'd vpon the piece too: and because He had in former times plaid the like pranke, My spirits were the more incouraged: In that a God had taken human shape, And in gold dew dropping himselfe through tiles Had closely, finely, wantond with his lemman And which o'th' Gods had done't? marie the same Who shakes with thunder heauens high arched frame Should I wormeling (then) make scruple of it? I did not, but imbrac'd it willingly. When this I cast in mind, the maid meane while Is cal'd for in, to wash: goes, bathes, returnes; And afterward they lay her in her bed: I waiting stand if they'ld bid me do ought. One comes to me, and sayes, you sirra Dorus Take you this fanne; and thus fanne wind vpon her: When we haue washt, you (if you will) wash too. I take it with sad countenance. Ant. At that time I would ha' seene that bashfull face of thine How thou great Asse didst stand holding a fanne. ChÃ¦. She had scarse spoken it, when all together Hurring out of the roome, depart to Bathe; And make such noise, as seruants commonly Are wont to do, when Masters are from home. Meane while a slumber seases on the maide. I priuily (thus) on the fannes side do leere, And looke about too, if all else be cleare: I saw all safe, and bolted fast the doore. Ant. What then? ChÃ¦. What then foole? Ant. I confesse it. ChÃ¦. Should I let slippe such opportunitie, So profferd, short, wish'd and not hoped for? I had beene then indeed such as I shewd for. Ant. Tis true thou sayest. But in the meane while what's done Cconcerning our repast? ChÃ¦. why all is readie. Ant. Thou art carefull: where? at your house? ChÃ¦. No at Discus Our free-mans. Ant. Tis farre hence, let's make more haste Go shift your cloathes. ChÃ¦. Where should I go to shift? Ime lost; from whom I stand as banished; I doubt my brother may be now within: Feare also, least my father be returnd Out of the countrey. Ant. Go we to our house, That's the next place, where you may shift your selfe: ChÃ¦. The aduise is good, lets go: withall I minde To take thy counsell, how I may my loue Further enioy. Ant. Content, our wits will prooue. Exeunt ChÃ¦. and Antipho.</field>

So help me God, I somewhat doubt poore creature By things I saw, least the inraged souldier Should raise some broile; and do my Mistresse wrong. For presently as soone as Chremes came The late giu'n young maides brother; she requests The souldier, he would cause him be cald in: He grew in fume, but yet durst not deny her. Shee further moues his inuitation Vnto their banquet: (this my Mistresse did To keepe him there; because as yet the time Seru'd not to tell him things concern'd his sister.) The souldier willd him sit; yet grumblingly. He plac'd, my mistresse frames discourse to him: The souldier thought a riuall had beene brought Vnder his nose, and minding to crie quittance Cal'd out, ho, one of you fetch Pamphila To sing to vs; Thais cryes out, at no hand: What her to a banquet? He would haue it so. Hence grew the matter to a downe right braule: My mistresse priuily tooke of her iewels, And gaue 'hem me in secret to bring thence. This is a certaine signe, whereby I know Shee'l slip thence, when she spies fit time thereto Manet Dorias. Scen. 2. Enter PhÃ¦dria. PhÃ¦. As I vpon my iourney passing was, A thronging troupe of busie thoughts do presse Into my mind; as oft it comes to passe To men whose soules some trouble seised has: And euery thing in the worse sence I guesse. What neede much talke? while these dumpes me possesse Vnheeded I was pass'd the towne I ment to, And was gonne farre beyond it; when at last Perceauing it I backe returned fast: And being scarce come vnto the turne which went to The towne, there staid; and in my minde thus cast, Two whole dayes must I this place here be pent to Alone without her? Why is that such a matter? Tis nothing: Nothing? What, if not come at her To touch her? must I yet be barr'd her sight? If that be cross'd, is this to be lost quite? To climbe the lowest, first step of loues lather Were somewhat yet. But why in such affright Enter Pythias. Comes Pythias foorth? and why so hastily? Manet PhÃ¦dria. Scen. 3. Pyth. VVretch that I am, wher shal I find this fellow? Where this vngodly wicked fellow find? That he should dare attempt a piece of worke So monstrous, so audacious! PhÃ¦.

How could an Eunuch do such thing? Pyth. I know not what he was; but what h'has done. The case it selfe doth shew The wench she weepes, And when one askes her, dare not vtter why. The honest fellow too's not to be found. Beside I feare, hee's runne away with somewhat. PhÃ¦. You make me wonder, where the lazie bones Should haue conueid himselfe: vnlesse perhaps He be retir'd backe to our house againe. Pyth. Pray, see if he be there. PhÃ¦. You shall know straight. Dorias. I am to seeke, good God sweete Pythias I haue not heard so strange an accident. Pyth. Yes, I had heard that they loued woman Deerely, but could do nothing.

Hath she alreadie Then left the souldier? Chr. oh yes long ago. And there has beene great falling out betweene 'hem: Pyth. Did she say nothing, you should follow her? Chr. Nothing, but at her parting winkd on me. Pyth. What, was not that sufficient Item man. Chr. I knew not that she meant so much, but that The souldier helpd my dull concerning her; Enter Thais. For out o' doores he thrust me: see where she is I maruell where it was, I ouer went her. Scen. 6. Thais I guesse he will be here straight, with intent To take her from me; let him come on then: But if he laie on little finger on her, Ile claw his eyes out. I can so farre beare His fopperies, and swolne bumbasted words Whil'st that they be but words: come they to deedes once, Ile ferrit him. Chr. I was here long since Thais. Thais. Oh Chremes, I lookd for you. Know you not That all this brabble hath beene about you? Chr. Me? how? as if I broacht it? Tha.

Ha'you not had sufficient triall of him? ChÃ¦. I will not, Pythias. Pyth. Ile not trust you, ChÃ¦rea; Vnlesse you be kept out. ChÃ¦. But (Pythias) Thy selfe shalt be my keeper. Pyth.

But see the honest fellow Parmeno, I thinke I haue found a tricke to nettle him, As I would wish. Ile first go in and heare The maides acknowledgement; and againe come foorth To fright the rogue with a fine pennieworth. Exit Pythias. Scen. 4. Par. I now scout out, to see what ChÃ¦rea has done: Who if he haue the businesse cleanely handled, Good gods! What glorious palme haue I then wonne? For to omit, that I a case intangled Haue wound out fairely to his hand; haue wrought, Haue compassed his loue, his wench, a maid He so did dote on: and yet cost him nought, (No purse expence, no trouble, hazard made,) And from a greedie harlot. Then agen Enter Pythias (Which I indeed accompt my Masters prise) That I haue found him out a readie meane, To learne these strumpets manners and full guise Which ripely vnderstood, he may for euer Detest their courses, when abroad they git, None are more neate and sweete in their behauiour, They mince and picke vpon each daintie bit; (With their friend eating such is their demeanor) And then to note their greedie rauening, Their sluttishnesse, their penurie at home; What nastie Cormorants they are alone; Out of stale porrage musty bread deuouring: These things are youths true cordialls being knowne. Scen. 5. Pyth. Roague for thy deeds &amp; words Ile plague thee so. Thou shalt not for our wrongs h?ce scot-free go. Your mercie oh good gods! oh cruell practise! Alas poore youth! but Ã´ that cursed vilaine! That vilaine Parmeno, that brought him hither! Par. What may the matter be? Pyth. It pitties me; Therefore I hasted out o' doores, poore woman: Because I would not see't. Oh, what example (Say thee) they do intend to make of him? Par. Ã´ God! What strange stirre's this? am not I lost, trow? Ile to her. What meanes this fright, Pythias? Pyth. Doost aske audacious fellow? whilst thou soughtst To put a tricke vpon vs, th'hast vndone, Hast vterly vndone that prettie youth, Thou broughtest vs for an Eunuch. Par. why, what's ch?c'd? Pyth. Doost know the maid was sent vs is free borne? And has a brother here of great accompt? Par. I know't not. Pyth. But she's prou'd so: this poore youth Has rauisht her; which when her brother heard of. Comming in furious heateâ Par. What did he do? Pyth. First piteously has bound him. Par. Ha, has Bound him? Pyth. I, although Thais beggd the contrarie. Par. What sayst? Pyth. And now he further threatneth To vse him in such sort, as is the wont To be perform'd vpon adulterers. Par. Vpon what confidence dare he venture So heynous an attempt? Pyth. Why, is't so heynous? Par. Is't not the heynousest that can be thought on? Who euer saw any one apprehended For an adulterer in a bawdie house? Pyth. I know not that. Par. But that thou maist know't I tell thee (Pythias) tis my Masters sonne. Prth. What, ist I pray? Par. Therefore let Thais looke then, She suffer him sustaine no iniurie. But why do I my selfe not rescue him? Pyth. Parmeno consider what you go about: Lest you not helpe him, and yet cast away Your selfe for euer. For they do imagine That all is done is of your practising. Enter the old man, Laches. Par. What shall I do then wretch? or what contriue. But lo, I see my old Master newly come Out o'the countrey: were I best acquaint him What is befalne or not? Ile tell him, sure; Though I do know, I shall pay soundly for it: But I must doot, that he may helpe his sonne. Pyth. I, thou doost wisely. Ile goe in. Deliuer Euery thing to him, as it chanc'd in order. Scen. 6. Lach. My Country grange yeelds this commoditie, I find no irksomnesse in field, or citie: I can shift place, being of either wearie. But is not yond our Parmeno? tis he. Who waite you here for before Thais doore? Par. Who's that? oh Master! you are wellcome home. Lach. Who wait'st thou here for? Par. I'm vndone, my Tongue Falters for feare. Lach. How's this? why shakst thou so? Tell me, 's all well here? Par. Master first I craue You would conceiue the matter as it stands: That what so ere hath happend, hath not come Through any fault of mine. Lach. Say, what it is? Par. Indeede you vrge the question orderly: I should haue first opend the case to you. PhÃ¦dria bought an Eunuch to bestow vpon her here Lach. Vpon whom here? Par. Thais. Lach. Bought saist thou? I am certainely vndone. What cost he? Par. Twentie pound. Lach. All's lost. Par. Besides ChÃ¦rea doos loue a minstrell wench here. Lach. Ha!

Lach. Sirrha, leaue talke Touching thy selfe. If I liue (pillorie) I'lâ,But vnfold first th'whole bus'nesse to me. Par. Charea was brought to Thais for that Eunuch. Lach. How! for an Eunuch? Par. Yes sir, afterward They haue taken him for an adulterer; And bound him. Lach. Oh, I'm undone for euer. Par. Pray note (good sir) these strumpets insolence. Lach. Is there yet any further mischiefe left, Or ill vnutterd. Par. This is all. Lach. Why stay I From breaking in vpon 'hem? Par. There's no doubt But I incurre some famous punishment: But since I must do't of necessitie, I ioy yet I shall worke these queanes some mischiefe. For th'old man long hath sought occasion To plague'hem soundly: now at last has found one. Enter Pythias. Scen. 7. Pyth. Troth for this many aday there has not chanced An accident more pleasant then this now; To see the old man come in so mistaken: 'T was sport to me alone of all the rest, Who knew the ground of th'eror. ha, ha, he. Par. What ist she laughes at? Pyth. I'm come forth to meete With Parmeno, but where a Gods name is he? Par. Doos she seeke me? Pyth. See where he is, Ile to him Par. What newes with thee now Giglet? Pyth. Ha, ha, he. Par. What meanst thou? why this laughter? goest thou on? Pyth. Ha, ha, ha, he. Oh-oh-I burst, I faint With laughing at thee. Par. Wherefore? Pyth. dost thou aske? Vpon my troth I neuer in my life Knew a more errand foole, nor euer shall. Ha, ha, ha, heâit cannot be expressed What pastime thou hast made vs yond' within: And yet (good truth) at first I tooke thee for A very wise and cunning pated fellow. Par. Why what's the matter? Pyth. What at the first dash Oughtst thou to credit euery thing I said? What didst thou thinke the braue exploit too little, The rash youth ventred through thy setting on; vnlesse thou further diddst discouer him vnto his father? prithe, tell me one thing; What thinkst thou Cherea thought, when now his father Found him so fine drest in an Eunuchs habit? How ist? seest thou yet, thou art ripe for hanging? Par. How? what saist thou pestilent queane, diddst lye then? Pyth. Ha, ha, ha, he. Par. And keep'st a laughing still too? Thinkst thou tis such fine pastime (harlotrie) To make a scorne of me? Pyth. Ã´ yes; sport; sport a life. Par. I, if perchance thou carry't away, scotfree. Pyth. Indeede la? Par. Ile crie quittance o' my credit. Pyth. Yes sure. We shall haue, time yet, Parmeno: For thee, thou art to be truss'd vp presently; Who fleshest heedlesse youth in vilanie And then betraist him to discouerie, Father and sonne will both make thee an example. Par. I am a dead man. Pyth. Looke you' this y'haue got now, For the Eunuch you late vsherd home to vs. Exit Pythias. Farewell. Par. Vnluckie I am caught iust like a rat, Trac'd by my noise, mine owne vnheedie chatt Enter Thraso and Gnato. Scen. 8. Gna. VVhat do we now? on what hopes? or with what Purpose Do we come hither? what intend you Traso? Thr. Who, I to yeeld my selfe to Thais mercie, Do all she shall inioyne. Gna. What ist you say? Thr. Why I lesse, then the valiant Hercules, Who condiscended to serue Omphale? Gna. I like the precedent Would I yet might see Her cracke your crowne once with her pantesse. Enter ChÃ¦rea. What newes? her doore opes. Thr. what new mischief's this? I nere saw this man yet: what may it meane, That he comes foorth so hastily and iocond? Scen. 9. ChÃ¦. Oh louing countriemen, liues any man More happie then my selfe? troth, I thinke none The Gods haue shewne all their full might on me; On whom so sodainely so many chances, So many prosperous chances meete in one. Par. Why is he growne so merrie? ChÃ¦. Oh my dearest, My kindest Parmeno' first fashioner, Contriuer, finisher, of all my fortunes; All my contentments. Knowest thou Parmeno What ioy I am in? hearest thou my Pamphila Is found to be free borne? Par. Yes, I haue heard so. ChÃ¦. Made sure to me? Par. As God shall helpe me, I'm Glad ont. Gna. do y' heare him what he saies? ChÃ¦. I ioy beside My brother PhÃ¦dria's loue is now faire setled: W'are made one house; Thais hath giu'n vp her selfe Vnto my fathers kindnesse and protection: Shee's now our owne. Par. Then she is all your brothers. ChÃ¦. That's most certaine. Par. Then (that's other cause of ioy) The souldier is cashierd hence. ChÃ¦. now I prithee Giue thou my brother notice of this newes, Where ere he may be found; and speedily. Par. Ile seeke for him at home. Thr. Doost thou now Gnato Make any doubt, but I am lost for euer? Gna. Sure I iudge so. ChÃ¦. What should I first count on? Whom chiefely praise? or him that counseld me Or yet my selfe that venturd the performance? Or shall I not yeeld fortune share of praise, Which guided these things thus? Which in one day Hath closed vp so many, so great things, And all so timely orderd? or the easie And pleasant disposition of my father? Oh I beseech thee, gratious Iupiter. Continue to vs this our happinesse Enter PhÃ¦dria. PhÃ¦. Your faith good Gods! What things aboue beleefe Hath our man told me? but where is my brother? ChÃ¦. Here. PhÃ¦. I am gladâ ChÃ¦. I well beleeue you, brother There is none liuing more deseruing loue Then this your Thais: she's a furtherer To all our family PhÃ¦. Why, how now brother, Commendst thou her to me? Thr. I am vndone: The lesser hope I haue, the more I loue. Helpe Gnato at a pinch; my trust's in thee. Gna. What wold you haue me do? Thr. Win by intreatie, By money. I may hold some place neere Thais. Gna. 'Tis a hard taske. Thr. Come, I know thee Gnato. If once thou vndertak'st a thingâworke this, And name but what reward or gift thoult haue And thou shalt hau't. Gna. Say you so? Thr. I, and will Performe it. Gna. If I performe it, I require your house Do euer open rest at my command, Be you within or not: that though vnbidden I still haue roome and welcome giuen me Thra. Here is my hand thou shalt. Gna. Then I will settle To the attempt. PhÃ¦. Whom heare I here? Ã´ Thraso! Thra. God saue you. PhÃ¦. Thou perhaps hear'st not the Newes? Thra. Yes, I know all. PhÃ¦. Why do I see you then Here in these quarters? Thr. Sir as resting onely Vpon your loue. PhÃ¦. Know'st thou not, what to rest on? I tell thee souldier, if I here henceforward Do take thee in this streete; th'art a dead man: It will auaile you little then to say You sought some man, or were to passe this way. Gna. Nay good sir this not fitteth. PhÃ¦. I haue said it. Gna. I know you are not of such boistrous temper. PhÃ¦. It shall so stand. Gna. Pray yet first giue me hearing Of a few words; which when I shall haue said As you do like it, grant it. PhÃ¦. Well, let's heare. Gna. Thraso remoue your selfe a little of. First I most earnestly request you both Thus farre to credit me; that what herein I do, is chiefely for my owne sake meant: But if the same may likewise further you, Twere simplenesse in you not to admit it. PhÃ¦. What ist? Gna. I thinke fit, you take vnto you This riuall souldier. PhÃ¦. How saist? take him to vs? Gna. Pray but consider this; you PhÃ¦dria Do surely loue your Thais companie, And so fare well: little you haue to giue her, And she of force must be supplied largely. Now then to serue her turne, and spare your cost, There's none can be more fitting, or more vsefull Then is this souldier: first has where withall, And then there's none more lauish: he's a foole A prating babling foole, a dolt, a blocke, will snore you out whole dayes, and nights together. And for the feare that she may happe to loue him, That's needelesse: you may pelt him out at pleasure: PhÃ¦. What were we best to do? Gna. Then adde this too; (Which I accompt a thing of greatest moment.) None fares more richly, none more daintily. PhÃ¦. Its mar'le but we haue neede at any hand Of this same fellow. ChÃ¦. That's my iudgement too. Gna. You take the right course. One thing more I beg, I may be made one of your companie: I haue beene long now rowling of this stone. PhÃ¦. We admit thee. ChÃ¦. Yes, and freely. Gna. PhÃ¦dria, And PhÃ¦ria in requitall, twixt you both I tender him to flout, and feede vpon. ChÃ¦. We like it. PhÃ¦. He deserues it. Gna. Thraso, now You may draw neere at pleasure. Thra. Gnato, say How stands my case? Gna. How? these men knew you not After I told, hem your conditions, Prais'd you according to your deeds and vertues; I wonne my sute. Thra. It was well done, I thanke thee. I neuer yet could come in any place But all men doated on me. Gna. Said I not: How gracefull was his tongue for eloquence? PhÃ¦. Thou left'st out nothing. Passe we this way hence. Exeunt all but Gnato.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Addition. Epilogue by Gnato. Athens and Rome full many ages hence Haue through Menanders, Plautus, Terence Art (In seuerall names but sounding to one sence) Seene this our Eunuch, grac'd the flatterers part. Those Greeke and Latine playes had their desart, Earning loude plaudits from their audience. Our English Author (h'has no Poets name, Nor (sayes he) may he dare such stile to take) Puts me vpon the brunt to stand the blame: Himselfe not venturing his approach to make, Nor to your censure his raw skill to stake. He thinkes me now wrought, past all feare and shame. But I the name and nature here cast off: I see amongst you no proud souldier, No selfe blowne bladder, I may pricke or scoffe: Our Nation is not guiltie of the former, Nor could I well play the flatterer: No marle if I the name now seeke to dosse Yet though I doffe the fawne; still bend I low, Crauing your gentle pardon for vs all; And thanke you for your patience hitherto So kindely showne to vs in generall. Oh, would you deigne some further grace withall Vpon our swouning writer to bestow, He dyes in feare least you mislike his paine; Your well clap'd hands call him to life againe. FINIS.</field>
