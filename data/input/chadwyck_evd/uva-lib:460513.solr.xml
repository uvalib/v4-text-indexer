      <field name="fulltext">ION; A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE REV. RICHARD VALPY, D. D., THIS ATTEMPT AT DRAMATIC COMPOSITION, AS A SLENDER TOKEN OF GRATITUDE, FOR BENEFITS WHICH CANNOT BE EXPRESSED IN WORDS, IS MOST RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED BY HIS AFFECTIONATE PUPIL, T. N. TALFOURD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Adrastus, King of Argos. Medon, High Priest of the Temple of Apollo at Argos. Crythes, Captain of the Royal Guard. Phocion, son of Medon. Ctesiphon, noble Argive youth. Cassander, noble Argive youth. Ion, a foundling youth protected by Medon. Agenor, Sage of Argos. Cleon, Sage of Argos. Timocles, Sage of Argos. Irus, a boy, slave of Agenor. Clemanthe, Medon's daughter. Abra, attendant on Clemanthe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene.âArgos. The Time of the Action is comprised in one day and night, and the following morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Interior of the Temple of Apollo, which is supposed to be placed on a rocky eminence. Early morning. The interior lighted by a single lamp suspended from the roof. Agenor resting against a column;âIrus seated on a bench at the side of the scene. Agenor comes forward and speaks. AGENOR. Will the dawn never visit us? These hours Toil heavy with the unresting curse they bear To do the work of desolating years! All distant sounds are hush'd;âthe shriek of death And the survivors' wail are now unheard, As grief had worn itself to patience. Irus! I'm loath so soon to break thy scanty rest, But my heart sickens for the tardy morn; Sure it is breaking;âspeed and look âyet hold, Know'st thou the fearful shelf of rock that hangs Above the encroaching waves, the loftiest point That stretches eastward? IRUS. Know it? Yes, my Lord; There often have I bless'd the opening day, Which thy free kindness gave me leave to waste In happy wandering through the forests. AGENOR. Well, Thou art not then afraid to tread it; there The earliest streak from the unrisen sun Is to be welcomed;âtell me how it gleams, In bloody portent or in saffron hope, And hasten back to slumber. IRUS. I shall haste: Believe not that thy summons spoil'd my rest; I was not sleeping. [Exit Irus. AGENOR. Heaven be with thee, child! His grateful mention of delights bestow'd On that most piteous state of servile childhood By liberal words chance-dropp'd, hath touch'd a vein Of feeling which I deem'd for ever numb'd, And, by a gush of household memories, breaks The icy casing of that thick despair Which day by day hath gather'd o'er my heart; While, basely safe, within this column'd circle, Uplifted far into the purer air And by Apollo's partial love secured, I have, in spirit, glided with the Plague As in foul darkness or in sickliest light, It wafted death through Argos; and mine ears, Listening athirst for any human sound, Have caught the dismal cry of confused pain, Which to this dizzy height the fitful wind Hath borne from each sad quarter of the vale Where life was. Re-enter Irus. Are there signs of day-break? IRUS. None; The eastern sky is still unbroken gloom. AGENOR. It cannot surely be. Thine eyes are dim (No fault of thine) for want of rest, or now I look upon them near, with scalding tears. Has care alighted on a head so young! What grief hast thou been weeping? IRUS. Pardon me; I never thought at such a mournful time To plead my humble sorrow in excuse Of poorly-render'd service: but my brotherâ Thou mayst have noted him,âa sturdy lad, With eye so merry and with foot so light That none could chide his gamesomenessâfell sick But yesterday, and died in my weak arms Ere I could seek for stouter aid; I hoped That I had taught my wretchedness to hide From thy observant care; but when I stood Upon the well-known terrace where we loved, Arm link'd in arm, to watch the gleaming sailsâ His favorite pastime, for he burn'd to share A seaman's hardy lot,âmy tears would flow, And I forgot to dry them. But I see Cleon is walking yonder; let me call him; For sure 'twill be a joy to speak with him. AGENOR. Call him, good youth, and then go in to sleep, Or, if thou wilt, to weep. [Exit Irus. I envy thee The privilege, but Jupiter forfend That I should rob thee of it! Enter Cleon. CLEON. Hail, Agenor! Dark as our lot remains, 'tis comfort yet To find thy age unstricken. AGENOR. Rather mourn That I am destined still to linger here In strange unnatural strength, while death is round me. I chide these sinews that are framed so tough Grief cannot palsy them; I chide the air Which round this citadel of nature breathes With sweetness not of this world; I would share The common grave of my dear countrymen, And sink to rest while all familiar things Old custom has endear'd are failing with me, Nor bear to shiver on in life behind them: Nor should these walls detain me from the paths Where death may be embraced, but that my word, In a rash moment plighted to our host, Forbids me to depart without his license, Which firmly he refuses. CLEON. Grant me pardon If I rejoice to find the generous Priest Means, with Apollo's blessing, to preserve The treasure of thy wisdom;ânay, he trusts not To promises alone; his gates are barr'd Against thy egress:ânone, indeed, may pass them Save the youth Ion, to whose earnest prayer His foster-father grants reluctant leave To visit the sad city at his will: And freely does he use the dangerous boon, Which, in my thought, the love that cherish'd him, Since he was found within the sacred grove Smiling amidst the storm, a most rare infant, Should have had sternness to deny. AGENOR. What, Ion The only inmate of this fane allowed To seek the mournful walks where death is busy!â Ion our some-time darling, whom we prized As a stray gift, by bounteous Heaven dismiss'd From some bright sphere which sorrow may not cloud To make the happy happier! Is he sent To grapple with the miseries of this time, Whose nature such etherial aspect wears As it would perish at the touch of wrong? By no internal contest is he train'd For such hard duty; no emotions rude Hath his clear spirit vanquish'd;âLove, the germ Of his mild nature, hath spread graces forth, Expanding with its progress, as the store Of rainbow colour which the seed conceals Sheds out its tints from its dim treasury, To flush and circle in the flower. No tear Hath fill'd his eye save that of thoughtful joy When, in the evening stillness, lovely things Press'd on his soul too busily; his voice, If, in the earnestness of childish sports, Raised to the tone of anger, check'd its force, As if it fear'd to break its being's law, And falter'd into music. When the forms Of guilty passion have been made to live In pictured speech, and others have wax'd loud In righteous indignation, he hath heard With sceptic smile, or from some slender vein Of goodness, which surrounding gloom conceal'd, Struck sunlight o'er it: so his life hath flow'd From its mysterious urn a sacred stream, In whose calm depth the beautiful and pure Alone are mirror'd; which, though shapes of ill May hover round its surface, glides in light, And takes no shadow from them. CLEON. Yet, methinks, Thou hast not lately met him, or a change Pass'd strangely on him had not miss'd thy wonder. His form appears dilated; in these eyes, Where pleasure danced, a thoughtful sadness dwells; Stern purpose knits the forehead, which till now Knew not the passing wrinkle of a care: Those limbs which in their heedless motion own'd A stripling's playful happiness, are strung As if the iron hardships of the camp Had given them sturdy nurture; and his step, Its airiness of yesterday forgotten, Awakes the echoes of these desolate courts, As if a warrior of heroic mould Paced them in armour. AGENOR. Hope is in thy tale. This is no freak of Nature's wayward course, But work of pitying Heaven; for not in vain The gods have pour'd into that guileless heart The strengths that nerve the hero;âthey are ours. CLEON. How can he aid us? Can he stay the pulse Of ebbing life,âarrest the infected winds, Or smite the viewless spectre of the grave? AGENOR. And dost thou think these breezes are our foes,â The innocent airs that used to dance around us, As if they felt the blessings they conveyed, Or that the death they bear is casual? No! 'Tis human guilt that blackens in the cloud, Flashes athwart its mass in jagged fire, Whirls in the hurricane, pollutes the air, Turns all the joyous melodies of earth To murmurings of doom. There is a foe Who in the glorious summit of the state Draws down the great resentment of the gods, Whom he defies to strike us;âyet his power Partakes that just infirmity which Nature Blends in the empire of her proudest sonsâ That it is cased within a single breast, And may be plucked thence by a single arm. Let but that arm, selected by the gods, Do its great office on the tyrant's life, And Argos breathes again! CLEON. A footstep!âhush! Thy wishes, falling on a slavish ear, Would tempt another outrage: 'tis a friendâ An honest though a crabbed oneâTimocles: Something hath ruffled him.âGood day, Timocles! [Timocles passes in front. He will not speak to us. AGENOR. But he shall speak. Timoclesânay then, thus I must enforce thee; [staying him. Sure thou wilt not refuse a comrade's hand That may be cold ere sunset. TIMOCLES. [giving his hand.] Thou mayst school me; Thy years and love have license: but I own not A stripling's mastery; is't fit, Agenor? AGENOR. Nay, thou must tell thy wrong: whate'er it prove, I hail thy anger as a hopeful sign, For it revives the thought of household days, When the small bickerings of friends had space To fret, and Death was not for ever nigh To frown upon estrangement. What has moved thee? TIMOCLES. I blush to tell it. Weary of the night And of my life, I sought the western portal: It opened, and, ascending from the stair That through the rock winds spiral from the town, Ion, the foundling cherish'd by the Priest, Stood in the entrance: with such mild command As he has often smilingly obeyed, I bade him stand aside and let me pass; Whenâwouldst thou think it?âin determined speech He gave me counsel to return: I press'd Impatient onward: he, with honied phrase His daring act excusing, grasp'd my arm With strength resistless; led me from the gate, Replaced its ponderous bars; and, with a look As modest as he wore in childhood, left me. AGENOR. And thou wilt thank him for it soon; he comesâ Now hold thy angry purpose if thou canst! Enter Ion. ION. I seek thee, good Timocles, to implore Again thy pardon. I am young in trust, And fear lest, in the earnestness of love, I stayed thy course too rudely. Thou hast borne My childish folly often,âdo not frown If I have ventured with unmanner'd zeal To guard the ripe experiences of years From one rash moment's danger. TIMOCLES. Leave thy care. If I am weary of the flutterer life, Is mortal bidding thus to cage it in? ION. And art thou tired of being? Has the grave No terrors for thee? Hast thou sunder'd quite Those thousand meshes which old custom weaves To bind us earthward, and gay fancy films With airy lustre various? Hast subdued Those cleavings of the spirit to its prison, Those nice regards, dear habits, pensive memories, That change the valour of the thoughtful breast To brave dissimulation of its fears? Is Hope quench'd in thy bosom? Thou art free, And in the simple dignity of man Standest apart untempted:âdo not lose The great occasion thou hast pluck'd from misery, Nor play the spendthrift with a great despair, But use it nobly! TIMOCLES. What to strike? to slay? ION. No!ânot unless the audible voice of Heaven Call thee to that dire office; but to shed On ears abused by falsehood, truths of power In words immortal,ânot such words as flash From the fierce demagogue's unthinking rage To madden for a moment and expire,â Nor such as the rapt orator imbues With warmth of facile sympathy, and moulds To mirrors radiant with fair images, To grace the noble fervour of an hour;â But words which bear the spirit of great deeds Wing'd for the future; which the dying breath Of Freedom's martyr shapes as it exhales, And to the most enduring forms of earth Commitsâto linger in the craggy shade Of the huge valley, 'neath the eagle's home, Or in the sea-cave where the tempest sleeps, Till some heroic leader bid them wake To thrill the world with echoes!âBut I talk Of things above my grasp, which strangely press Upon my soul, and tempt me to forget The duties of my youth;âpray you forgive me. TIMOCLES. Have I not said so? AGENOR. Welcome to the morn! The eastern gates unfold, the Priest approaches; [As Agenor speaks, the great gates at the back of the scene open; the sea is discovered far beneath,âthe dawn breaking over it; Medon, the Priest, enters attended.] And lo! the sun is struggling with the gloom, Whose masses fill the eastern sky, and tints Its edges with dull red;âbut he will triumph; Bless'd be the omen! MEDON. God of light and joy, Once more delight us with thy healing beams! If I may trace thy language in the clouds That wait upon thy rising, help is nighâ But help achieved in blood. ION. Sayst thou in blood? MEDON. Yes, Ion!âwhy, he sickens at the word, Spite of his new-born strength;âthe sights of woe That he will seek have shed their paleness on him. Has this night's walk shown more than common sorrow? ION. I pass'd the palace where the frantic king Yet holds his crimson revel, whence the roar Of desperate mirth came, mingling with the sigh Of death-subdued robustness, and the gleam Of festal lamps mid spectral columns hung Flaunting o'er shapes of anguish made them ghastlier. How can I cease to tremble for the sad ones He mocksâand him the wretchedest of all? TIMOCLES. And canst thou pity him? Dost thou discern, Amidst his impious darings, plea for him? ION. Is he not childless, friendless, and a king? He's human; and some pulse of good must live Within his natureâhave ye tried to wake it? MEDON. Yes; I believe he felt our sufferings once; When, at my strong entreaty, he dispatch'd Phocion my son to Delphos, there to seek Our cause of sorrow; but, as time dragg'd on Without his messenger's return, he grew Impatient of all counsel,âto his palace In awful mood retiring, wildly call'd The reckless of his court to share his stores And end all with him. When we dared disturb His dreadful feastings with a humble prayer That he would meet us, the poor slave who bore The message, flew back smarting from the scourge, And mutter'd a decree that he who next Unbidden met the tyrant's glance should die. AGENOR. I am prepared to brave it. CLEON. So am I. TIMOCLES. And Iâ ION. O do not think my prayer Bespeaks unseemly forwardnessâsend me! The coarsest reed that trembles in the marsh, If Heaven select it for its instrument, May shed celestial music on the breeze As clearly as the pipe whose virgin gold Befits the lip of PhÅbus;âye are wise, And needed by your country; ye are fathers: I am a lone stray thing, whose little life By strangers' bounty cherish'd, like a wave That from the summer sea a wanton breeze Lifts for a moment's sparkle, will subside Light as it rose, nor leave a sigh in breaking. MEDON. Ion, no sigh! ION. Forgive me if I seem'd To doubt that thou wilt mourn me if I fall, Nor would I tax thy love with such a fear But that high promptings, which could never rise Spontaneous in my nature, bid me plead Thus boldly for the mission. MEDON. My brave boy! It shall be as thou wilt. I see thou art call'd To this great peril, and I will not stay thee. When wilt thou be prepared to seek it? ION. Now. Only before I go, thus, on my knee, Let me in one word thank thee for the joys With which my days were peopled;âfor a life Made by thy love a cloudless holiday; And O, my more than father! let me look Up to thy face as if indeed a father's, And give me a son's blessing. MEDON. Bless thee, son! I should be marble now; let's part at once. ION. If I should not return, bless Phocion from me; And, for Clemantheâmay I speak one word, One parting word with my fair playfellow? MEDON. If thou wouldst have it so, thou shalt. ION. Farewell then! Your prayers wait on my steps. The arm of Heaven I feel in life or death will be around me. [Exit. MEDON. O grant it be in life! Let's to the sacrifice. [Exeunt. SCENE II. An apartment of the Temple. Enter Clemanthe followed by Abra. CLEMANTHE. Is he so changed? ABRA. His bearing is so alter'd That, distant, I scarce knew him for himself; But, looking in his face, I felt his smile Gracious as ever, though its sweetness wore Unwonted sorrow in it. CLEMANTHE. He will go To some high fortune, and forget us all, Reclaim'd (be sure of it) by noble parents; Me he forgets already; for five days, Five melancholy days, I have not seen him. ABRA. Thou knowest that he has privilege to range The infected city, and, 'tis said, he spends The hours of needful rest in squalid hovels Where death is most forsaken. CLEMANTHE. Why is this? Why should my father, niggard of the lives Of aged men, be prodigal of youth So rich in glorious prophecy as his? ABRA. He comes to answer for himself. I'll leave you. [Exit. CLEMANTHE. Stay! Well my heart may guard its secret best By its own strength. Enter Ion. ION. How fares my pensive sister? CLEMANTHE. How should I fare but ill when the pale hand Draws the black foldings of the eternal curtain Closer and closer round usâPhocion absentâ And thou, forsaking all within thy home, Wilt risk thy life with strangers, in whose aid Even thou canst do but little? ION. It is little. But in these sharp extremities of fortune, The blessings which the weak and poor can scatter Have their own season. 'Tis a little thing To give a cup of water; yet its draught Of cool refreshment drain'd by fever'd lips, May give a shock of pleasure to the frame More exquisite than when nectarean juice Renews the life of joy in festal hours. It is a little thing to speak a phrase Of common comfort which by daily use Has almost lost its sense; yet on the ear Of him who thought to die unmourn'd 'twill fall Like choicest music; fill the glaring eye With gentle tears; relax the knotted hand To know the bonds of fellowship again; And shed on the departing soul a sense More precious than the benison of friends About the honor'd deathbed of the rich, To him who else were lonely, that another Of the great family is near and feels. CLEMANTHE. O thou canst never bear these mournful offices! So blithe, so merry once! Will not the sight Of frenzied agonies unfix thy reason, Or the dumb woe congeal thee? ION. No, Clemanthe; They are the patient sorrows that touch nearest! If thou hadst seen the warrior while he writhed In the last grapple of his mighty frame With mightier anguish, strive to cast a smile (And not in vain) upon his fragile wife, Waning beside him,âand, his limbs composed, The widow of the moment fix her gaze Of longing, speechless love, upon the babe, The only living thing which yet was hers, Spreading its arms for its own resting-place, Yet with attenuated hand wave off The unstricken child, and so embraceless die, Stifling the mighty hunger of the heart; Thou couldst endure the sight of selfish grief In sullenness or frenzy;âbut to-day Another lot falls on me. CLEMANTHE. Thou wilt leave us! I read it plainly in thy alter'd mien;â Is it for ever? ION. That is with the gods. I go but to the palace, urged by hope, Which from afar hath darted on my soul, That to the humbleness of one like me The haughty king may listen. CLEMANTHE. To the palace! Knowest thou the perilânay the certain issue That waits thee? Death!âThe tyrant has decreed it, Confirmed it with an oath; and he has power To keep that oath; for, hated as he is, The reckless soldiers who partake his riot Are swift to do his bidding. ION. I know all; But they who call me to the work can shield me, Or make me strong to suffer. CLEMANTHE. Then the sword Falls on thy neck! O Gods! to think that thou, Who in the plenitude of youthful life Art now before me, ere the sun decline, Perhaps in one short hour shalt lie cold, cold, To speak, smile, bless no more!âThou shalt not go! ION. Thou must not stay me, fair one; even thy father, Who (blessings on him!) loves me as his son, Yields to the will of Heaven. CLEMANTHE. And he can do this! I shall not bear his presence if thou fallest By his consent; so shall I be alone. ION. Phocion will soon return, and juster thoughts Of thy admiring father close the gap Thy old companion left behind him. CLEMANTHE. Never! What will to me be father, brother, friends, When thou art goneâthe light of our life quench'dâ Haunting like spectres of departed joy The home where thou wert dearest? ION. Thrill me not With words that in their agony suggest A hope too ravishing,âor my head will swim, And my heart faint within me. CLEMANTHE. Has my speech Such blessed power? I will not mourn it then, Though it hath told a secret I had borne Till death in silence;âhow affection grew To this, I know not;âday succeeded day, Each fraught with the same innocent delights, Without one shock to ruffle the disguise Of sisterly regard which veil'd it well, Till thy changed mien reveal'd it to my soul, And thy great peril makes me bold to tell it. Do not despise it in me! ION. With deep joy Thus I receive it. Trust me, it is long Since I have learn'd to tremble midst our pleasures, Lest I should break the golden dream around me With most ungrateful rashness. I should bless The sharp and perilous duty which hath press'd A life's deliciousness into these moments,â Which here must end. I came to say, farewell, And the word must be said. CLEMANTHE. Thou canst not mean it! Have I disclaim'd all maiden bashfulness To tell the cherish'd secret of my soul To my soul's master, and in rich return Obtain'd the dear assurance of his love, To hear him speak that miserable word, I cannotâwill not echo? ION. Heaven has call'd me, And I have pledged my honor. When thy heart Bestow'd its preference on a friendless boy, Thou didst not image him a recreant; nor Must he prove so, by thy election crown'd. Thou hast endow'd me with the right to claim Thy help through this our journey, be its course Lengthen'd to age, or in an hour to end, And now I ask it!âbid my courage hold, And with thy free approval send me forth In soul apparell'd for my office! CLEMANTHE. Go! I would not have thee other than thou art, Living or dyingâand if thou shouldst fallâ ION. Be sure I shall return. CLEMANTHE. If thou shouldst fall, I shall be happier as the affianced bride Of thy cold ashes, than in proudest fortunesâ Thineâever thineâ [she faints in his arms. ION. [calls.] Abra!âSo best to partâ [Enter Abra. Let her have air; be near her through the day; I know thy tendernessâshould ill news come Of any friend, she will require it all. [Abra bears Clemanthe out. Ye Gods, that have enrich'd the life ye claim With priceless treasure, strengthen me to yield it! [Exit. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Terrace of the Palace. ADRASTUS, CRYTHES. ADRASTUS. The air breathes freshly after our long night Of glorious revelry. I'll walk awhile. CRYTHES. It blows across the town; dost thou not fear It bear infection with it? ADRASTUS. Fear! dost talk Of fear to me? I deem'd even thy poor thoughts Had better scann'd their master. Prithee tell me In what act, word, or look, since I have borne Thy converse here, hast thou discern'd such baseness As makes thee bold to prate to me of fear? CRYTHES. My liege, of human might all know thee fearless, But may not heroes shun the elements When sickness taints them? ADRASTUS. Let them blast me nowâ I stir not; tremble not; these massive walls, Whose date o'erawes tradition, gird the home Of a great race of kings, along whose line The eager mind lives aching, through the darkness Of ages else unstoried, till its shapes Of armed sovereigns spread to godlike port, And, frowning in the uncertain dawn of time, Strike awe, as powers who ruled an elder world, In mute obedience. I, sad heriter Of all their glories, feel our doom is nigh; And I will meet it as befits their fame; Nor will I vary my selected path, The breadth of my sword's edge, nor check a wish, If such unkingly yielding might avert it. CRYTHES. Thou art ever royal in thy thoughts. ADRASTUS. No moreâ I would be private. [Exit Crythes. Grovelling parasite! Why should I waste these fate-environ'd hours, And pledge my high defiance to despair With flatterers such as thou;âas if my joys Required the pale reflections cast by slaves In mirror'd mockery round my throne, or lack'd The aid of reptile sympathies to stream Through fate's black pageantry. Let weakness seek Companionship: I'll henceforth feast alone. Enter a Soldier. SOLDIER. My liege, forgive me. ADRASTUS. Well! Speak out at once Thy business, and retire. SOLDIER. I have no part In the presumptuous message that I bear. ADRASTUS. Tell it, or go. There is no time to waste On idle terrors. SOLDIER. Thus it is, my lord:â As we were burnishing our arms, a man Enter'd the court, and when we saw him first Was tending towards the palace; in amaze, We hail'd the rash intruder; still he walk'd Unheeding onward, till the western gate Barr'd further course; then turning, he besought Our startled band to lead him to the king, That he might urge a message which the sages Had charged him to deliver. ADRASTUS. Ha! the greybeards Who, mid the altars of the gods, conspire To cast the image of supernal power From earth, which it ennobles. What old rebel Is so resolved to play the orator That he would die for't? SOLDIER. He is but a youth, Yet urged his prayer with a sad constancy Which could not be denied. ADRASTUS. O bravely plann'd This is sedition worthy of the herd Of sophist traitors; brave to scatter fancies Of discontent midst sturdy artisans, Whose honest sinews they direct unseen, And make their proxies in the work of peril!â 'Tis fit, when burning to insult their king, And warn'd the pleasure must be bought with life, Their valour send a boy to speak their wisdom! Thou know'st my last decree; tell this rash youth The danger he incurs;âthen let him pass, And own the king more gentle than his masters. SOLDIER. We have already told him of the fate Which waits his daring; courteously he thank'd us, But still with solemn accent urged his suit. ADRASTUS. Tell him once more, if he persists, he diesâ Then, if he will, admit him. Should he hold His purpose, order Crythes to conduct him, And see the headsman instantly prepare To do his office. [Exit Soldier. So resolved, so youngâ 'Twere pity he should fall; yet he must fall, Or the great sceptre, which hath sway'd the fears Of ages, will become a common staff For youth to wield or age to rest upon, Despoil'd of all its virtues. He must fall, Else they who prompt the insult will grow bold, And with their pestilent vauntings through the city Raise the low fog of murky discontent, Which now creeps harmless through its marshy birthplace, To veil my setting glories. He is warn'd; And if he cross yon threshold, he shall die. Enter Crythes and Ion. CRYTHES. The king! ADRASTUS. Stranger, I bid thee welcome; We are about to tread the same dark passage, Thou almost on the instant.âIs the sword [To Crythes. Of justice sharpen'd, and the headsman ready? CRYTHES. Thou mayst behold them plainly in the court; Even now the solemn soldiers line the ground; The steel gleams on the altar; and the slave Disrobes himself for duty. ADRASTUS. [To Ion.] Dost thou see them? ION. I do. ADRASTUS. By Heaven, he does not change! If, even now, thou wilt depart and leave Thy traitorous thoughts unspoken, thou art free. ION. I thank thee for thy offer; but I stand Before thee for the lives of thousands, rich In all that makes life precious to the brave; Who perish not alone, but in their fall Break the far-spreading tendrils that they feed, And leave them nurtureless. If thou wilt hear me For them, I am content to speak no more. ADRASTUS. Thou hast thy wish then. Crythes! till yon dial Cast its thin shadow on the approaching hour, I hear this gallant traitor. On the instant, Come without word and lead him to his doom. Now leave us. CRYTHES. What, alone? ADRASTUS. Yes, slave! alone. He is no assassin! [Exit Crythes. Tell me who thou art. What generous source owns that heroic blood, Which holds its course thus bravely? What great wars Have nursed the courage that can look on death, Certain and speedy death, with placid eye? ION. I am a simple youth, who never bore The weight of armour,âone who may not boast Of noble birth or valour of his own. Deem not the powers which nerve me thus to speak In thy great presence, and have made my heart Upon the verge of bloody death as calm, As equal in its beatings, as when sleep Approach'd me nestling from the sportive toils Of thoughtless childhood, and celestial dreams Began to glimmer through the deepening shadows Of soft oblivion, to belong to meâ These are the strengths of Heaven; to thee they speak, Bid thee to hearken to thy people's cry, Or warn thee that thy hour must shortly come! ADRASTUS. I know it must; so mayst thou spare thy warnings; The envious gods in me have doom'd a race, Whose glories stream from the same cloud-girt founts, Whence their own dawn'd upon the infant world; And I shall sit on my ancestral throne To meet their vengeance; but till then I rule, As I have ever ruled, and thou wilt feel. ION. I will not further urge thy safety to thee; It may be, as thou sayst, too late; nor seek To make thee tremble at the gathering curse Which shall break out triumphant at thy fall; But thou art gifted with a nobler senseâ I know thou art, my sovereignâsense of pain Endured by myriad Argives, in whose souls, And in whose fathers' souls, thou and thy fathers Have kept their cherish'd state; whose heartstrings, still The living fibres of thy rooted power, Quiver with agonies thy crimes have drawn From heavenly justice on them. ADRASTUS. How! my crimes? ION. Yes; 'tis the eternal law that where guilt is, Sorrow shall answer it; and thou hast not A poor man's privilege to bear alone, Or in the narrow circle of his kinsmen The penalties of evil, for in thine A nation's fate is circled.âKing Adrastus! Mail'd as thy heart is with the usages Of pomp and power, a few short summers since Thou wert a child, and canst not be relentless. O, if maternal love embraced thee then, Think of the mothers who with eyes unwet Glare o'er their perishing children: hast thou shared The glow of a first friendship, which is born Midst the rude sports of boyhood, think of youth Smitten amidst its playthings;âlet the spirit Of thy own innocent childhood whisper pity! ADRASTUS. In every word thou dost but steel my soul. My youth was blasted;âparents, brother, kinâ All that should people infancy with joyâ Conspired to poison mine; despoil'd my life Of innocence and hopeâall but the sword And sceptreâdost thou wonder at me now? ION. I knew that we should pityâ ADRASTUS. Pity! dare To speak that word again, and torture waits thee! I am yet king of Argos. Well, go onâ Thy time is short, and I am pledged to hear. ION. If thou hast ever lovedâ ADRASTUS. Beware! beware! ION. Thou hast! I see thou hast! Thou art not marble, And thou shalt hear me!âThink upon the time When the clear depths of thy yet lucid soul Were ruffled with the troublings of strange joy, As if some unseen visitant from heaven Touch'd the calm lake and wreath'd its images In sparkling waves;ârecall the dallying hope That on the margin of assurance trembled, As loth to lose in certainty too bless'd Its happy being;âtaste in thought again Of the stolen sweetness of those evening walks, When pansied turf was air to winged feet, And circling forests by etherial touch Enchanted, wore the livery of the sky, As if about to melt in golden light Shapes of one heavenly vision; and thy heart Enlarged by its new sympathy with one, Grew bountiful to all! ADRASTUS. That tone! that tone! Whence came it? from thy lips? It cannot beâ The long-hush'd music of the only voice That ever spake unbought affection to me, And waked my soul to blessing!âO sweet hours Of golden joy, ye come! your glories break Through my pavilion'd spirit's sable folds! Roll on! roll on!âStranger, thou dost enforce me To speak of things unbreathed by lip of mine To human ear;âwilt listen? ION. As a child. ADRASTUS. Again! that voice again!âthou hast seen me moved As never mortal saw me, by a tone Which some light breeze, enamour'd of the sound, Hath wafted through the woods, till thy young voice Caught it to rive and mock me. At my birth This city, which, expectant of its Prince, Lay hush'd, broke out in clamorous ecstacies; Yet, in that moment, while the uplifted cups Foam'd with the choicest product of the sun, And welcome thundered from a thousand throats My doom was seal'd. From the hearth's vacant space, In the dark chamber where my mother lay, Faint with the sense of pain-bought happiness, Came forth, in heart-appalling tone, these words Of me the nurselingââWoe unto the babe! âAgainst the life which now begins shall life âLighted from thence be arm'd, and both soon quench'd, âEnd this great line in sorrow!ââEre I grew Of years to know myself a thing accursed, A second son was born, to steal the love Which fate had else scarce rifled: he became My parents' hope, the darling of the crew Who lived upon their smiles, and thought it flattery To trace in every foible of my youthâ A prince's youth!âthe workings of the curse; My very motherâGod! I cannot bear To speak it nowâlook'd freezingly upon me! ION. But thy brotherâ ADRASTUS. Died. Thou hast heard the lie, The common lie that every peasant tells Of me his master,âthat I slew the boy. 'Tis false:âone summer's eve, below a crag Which, in his wilful mood, he strove to climb, He lay a mangled corpse: the very slaves, Whose cruelty had shut him from my heart, Now coin'd their own injustice into proof To brand me as his murderer. ION. Did they dare Accuse thee? ADRASTUS. Not in open speech:âthey felt I should have seized the miscreant by the throat, And crush'd the lie half-spoken with the life Of the base speaker;âbut the tale look'd out From the stolen gaze of coward eyes, which shrunk When mine has met them; murmur'd through the crowd That at the sacrifice, or feast, or game Stood distant from me; burnt into my soul When I beheld it in my father's shudder. ION. Didst not declare thy innocence? ADRASTUS. To whom? To parents who could doubt me? To the ring Of grave impostors, or their shallow sons, Who should have studied to prevent my wish Before it grew to language; hail'd my choice To service as a prize to wrestle for; And whose reluctant courtesy I bore, Pale with proud anger, till from lips compress'd The blood has started? To the common herd, The vassals of our ancient house, the mass Of bones and muscles framed to till the soil A few brief years, then rot unnamed beneath it, Or, deck'd for slaughter at their monarch's call, To smite and to be smitten, and lie crush'd In heaps to swell his glory or his shame? Answer to them: No! though my heart had burst, As it was nigh to bursting!âTo the mountains I fled, and on their pinnacles of snow Breasted the icy wind, in hope to cool My spirit's feverâstruggled with the oak In search of weariness, and learn'd to rive Its stubborn boughs, till limbs once lightly strung Might mate in cordage with its infant stems; Or on the sea-beat rock tore off the vest Which burnt upon my bosom, and to air Headlong committed, clove the water's depth Which plummet never sounded;âbut in vain. ION. Yet succour came to thee? ADRASTUS. A blessed one! Which the strange magic of thy voice revives, And thus unlocks my soul: my rapid steps Were in a wood-encircled valley stayed By the bright vision of a maid, whose face Most lovely more than loveliness reveal'd, In touch of patient grief, which dearer seem'd Than happiness to spirit sear'd like mine. With feeble hands she strove to lay in earth The body of her aged sire, whose death Left her alone. I aided her sad work, And soon two lonely ones by holy rites Became one happy being. Days, weeks, months, In streamlike unity flow'd silent by us In our delightful nest. My father's spiesâ Slaves, whom my nod should have consign'd to stripes Or the swift falchionâtrack'd our sylvan home Just as my bosom knew its second joy, And, spite of fortune, I embraced a son. ION. Commission'd by thy parents to avert That dreadful prophecy? ADRASTUS. Fools! did they deem Its worst accomplishment could match the ill Which they wrought on me? It had left unharm'd A thousand ecstacies of passion'd years, Which, tasted once, live ever, and disdain Fate's iron grapple! Could I now behold That son with knife uplifted at my heart, A moment ere my life-blood follow'd it I would embrace him with my dying eyes, And pardon destiny! While crysome smiles Wreathed on the infant's face, as if sweet spirits Suggested pleasant fancies to its soul, The ruffians broke upon us; seized the child; Dash'd through the thicket to the beetling rock 'Neath which the deep wave eddies: I stood still As stricken into stone: I heard him cry, Press'd by the rudeness of the murderers' gripe, Severer ill unfearingâthen the splash Of waters that shall cover him for ever; And could not stir to save him! ION. And the motherâ ADRASTUS. She spake no word, but clasp'd me in her arms, And lay her down to die. A lingering gaze Of love she fix'd on meânone other loved, And so pass'd hence. By Jupiter, her look! Her dying patience glimmers in thy face! She lives again! She looks upon me now! There's magic in't. Bear with meâI am childish. Enter Crythes and Guards. ADRASTUS. Why art thou here? CRYTHES. The dial points the hour. ADRASTUS. Dost thou not see that horrid purpose past? Hast thou no heartâno sense? CRYTHES. Scarce half an hour Hath flown since the command on which I wait. ADRASTUS. Scarce half an hour!âyearsâyears have roll'd since then. Begone; remove that pageantry of deathâ It blasts my sightâand harken! Touch a hair Of this brave youth, or look on him as now With thy cold hangman's eye, and yonder band Shall not desire a spectacle in vain. Hence without word. [Exit Crythes. What wouldst thou have me do? ION. Let thy awaken'd heart speak its own language; Convene thy sages;âfrankly, nobly meet them; Explore with them the pleasure of the gods, And, at however high a cost, perform it. ADRASTUS. Well! I will seek their presence in an hour; Go summon them, young hero:âhold! no word Of the strange passion thou hast witness'd here. ION. Distrust me not.âBenignant Powers, I thank ye! [Exit. ADRASTUS. Yet stayâhe's goneâhis spell is on me yet; What have I promised him? To meet the men Who from my living head would strip the crown And sit in judgment on me?âI must do itâ Yet shall my band be ready to o'erawe The course of liberal speech, and, if it rise So as too loudly to offend my ear, Strike the rash brawler dead!âwhat idle dream Of long-past days had melted me? It fadesâ It vanishesâI am again a king! SCENE II. The interior of the Temple. [Same as Act I. Scene I.] [Clemanthe seatedâAbra attending her.] ABRA. Look, dearest lady!âthe thin smoke aspires In the calm air, as when in happier times It show'd the gods propitious; wilt thou seek Thy chamber, lest thy father and his friends, Returning, find us hinderers of their council? She answers notâshe hearkens notâwith joy Could I believe her, for the first time, sullen!â Still she is rapt. [Enter Agenor.] O, speak to my sweet mistress, Haply thy voice may rouse her. AGENOR. Dear Clemanthe, Hope dawns in every omen; we shall hail Our tranquil hours again. [Enter Medon, Cleon, Timocles, and others.] MEDON. Clemanthe here! How sad! how pale! ABRA. Her eye is kindlingâhush! CLEMANTHE. Hark! hear ye not a distant footstep? MEDON. No. Look round, my fairest child; thy friends are near thee. CLEMANTHE. Yes!ânow 'tis lostâ'tis on the winding-stairâ Nearer and more distinctâ'tis hisâ'tis hisâ He lives! he comes! [Clemanthe rises and rushes to the back of the stage, at which Ion appears, and returns with him.] Here is your messenger, Whom Heaven has rescued from the tyrant's rage Which ye permitted him to brave. Rejoice That ye are guiltless of his blood!âwhy pause ye, Why shout ye not his welcome? MEDON. Dearest girl, This is no scene for thee; go to thy chamber, I'll come to thee ere long. [Exeunt Clemanthe and Abra.] She is o'erwrought By fear and joy for one whose infant hopes Were mix'd with hers, even as a brother's. TIMOCLES. Ion! How shall we do thee honor? ION. None is due Save to the gods whose gracious influence sways The king ye deem'd relentless;âhe consents To meet the sages presently in council; And, linger not, lest this benign resolve Prove the last rally of his nobler nature, In fitful strength, ere it be quench'd for ever! MEDON. Haste to your seats; I will but speak a word With our brave friend, and follow; though convened In speed, let our assembly lack no forms Of due observance, which to furious power Plead with the silent emphasis of years. [Exeunt all but Medon and Ion. Ion draw near me; this eventful day Hath shown thy nature's graces circled round With firmness which accomplishes the hero;â And it would bring to me but one proud thought That virtues which required not culture's aid Shed their first fragrance 'neath my roof, and there Found shelter;âbut it also hath reveal'd What I may not hide from thee, that my child, My blithe and innocent girlâmore fair in soul, More delicate in fancy than in mouldâ Loves thee with other than a sister's love. I should have cared for this: I vainly deem'd A fellowship in childhood's thousand joys And household memories had nurtured friendship Which might hold blameless empire in the soul; But in that guise the traitor hath stolen in, And the fair citadel is thine. ION. 'Tis true. I did not think the nurseling of thy house Could thus disturb its holiest inmate's duty With selfish aspirations;âbut we met As playmates who might never meet again, And then the hidden truth flash'd forth, and show'd To each the image in the other's soul In one bright instant. Fear not lest my fortunes So dim should hold a maiden in their thrall Borne to be happy; I have that within Which warns me that I shall not disturb them long. MEDON. Far be the presage!âdo I hear aright That in no gracious pity, but in love Free as her own, thy plighted faith is hers? ION. Indeed! indeed! and canst thou love me still, My rebel wish disclosed? MEDON. My son! my son! 'Tis we should feel uplifted, for the seal Of greatness is upon thee; yet I know That when the gods, won by thy virtues, draw The veil which now conceals their lofty birthplace, Thou wilt not spurn the maid who prized them lowly. ION. Spurn her! My father! [Enter Ctesiphon.] MEDON. Ctesiphon!âand breathlessâ Art come to chide me to the council? CTESIPHON. No; To bring unwonted joy; thy son has landed. MEDON. Thank Heaven! Hast spoken with him? Is he well? CTESIPHON. I strove in vain to reach him, for the crowd Roused from the untended couch and dismal hearth By the strange visiting of hope, press'd round him; But, by his head erect and fiery glance, I know that he is well, and that he bears A message which shall shake the tyrant. [Shouts.] See! The throng is tending this wayânow it parts, And yields him to thy arms. Enter Phocion. MEDON. Welcome, my Phocionâ Long waited for in Argos, how detain'd Now matters not, since thou art here in joy. Hast brought the answer of the god? PHOCION. I have: Now let Adrastus tremble! MEDON. May we hear it? PHOCION. I am sworn first to utter it to him. CTESIPHON. But it is fatal to him!âSay but that! PHOCION. Ha, Ctesiphon!âI mark'd thee not before; How fares thy father? ION. [To Phocion.] Do not speak of him. CTESIPHON. [Overhearing Ion.] Not speak of him! Dost think there is a moment When common things eclipse the burning thought Of him and vengeance? PHOCION. Has the tyrant's swordâ CTESIPHON. No, Phocion; that were merciful and brave Compared to his base deed; yet will I tell it To make the flashing of thine eye more deadly, And edge thy words that they may rive his heartstrings. The last time that Adrastus dared to face The sages of the state, although my father, Yielding to nature's mild decay, had left All worldly toil and hope, he gather'd strength, In his old seat, to speak one word of warning. Thou knowest how bland with years his wisdom grew, And with what phrases, steep'd in love, he sheath'd The sharpness of rebuke; yet, ere his speech Was done, the tyrant started from his throne, And with his base hand smote him;â'twas his death-stroke! The old man totter'd home, and only once Raised his head after. PHOCION. Thou wert absent? Fool! How could I ask the question! CTESIPHON. Had I seen That sacrilege, the tyrant had lain dead, Or I had been torn piecemeal by his minions. But I was far away: when I return'd, I found my father on the nearest bench Within our door, his thinly silver'd head Supported by wan hands which hid his face And would not be withdrawn;âno groan, no sigh Was audible, and we might only learn By short convulsive tremblings of his frame That life still flicker'd in itâyet at last, By some unearthly inspiration roused, He dropp'd his wither'd hands, and sat erect As in his manhood's gloryâthe free blood Flush'd crimson through his cheeks, his furrow'd brow Expanded clear, and his eyes open'd full Gleam'd with a youthful fire;âI fell in awe Upon my knees before himâstill he spake not, But slowly raised his arm untrembling; clench'd His hand as if it grasp'd an airy dagger, And struck in air; my hand was join'd with his In nervous graspâmy lifted eye met his, In stedfast gazeâmy pressure answer'd hisâ We knew at once each other's thought; a smile Of the old sweetness play'd upon his lips, And life forsook him: with unthinking rage Unarm'd I sought the tyrant, to be driven From his proud gates with mockery by the hirelings, Who with their base swords circle him. He livesâ And I am here to babble of revenge! PHOCION. It comes, my friendâhaste with me to the king! ION. Even while we speak, Adrastus meets his council; There let us seek him; should ye find him touch'd With penitence, as happily ye may, O, give allowance to his soften'd nature! CTESIPHON. Show grace to him!âDost dare?âI had forgot, Thou dost not know what 'tis to love a father! ION. I know enough to feel for thee; I know Thou hast endured the vilest wrong that tyranny In its worst frenzy can inflict;âyet think, O think! before the irrevocable deed Shuts out all thought, how much of power's excess Is theirs who raise the idol:âdo we groan Beneath the personal force of this rash man, Who forty summers since hung at the breast A playful weakling; whom the heat unnerves; The north-wind pierces; and the hand of death May, in a moment, change to clay as vile As that of the scourged slave whose chains it severs? No! 'tis our weakness gasping for the shows Of outward strength that builds up tyranny, And makes it look so glorious:âIf we shrink Faint-hearted from the reckoning of our span Of mortal days, we pamper the fond wish For long duration in a line of kings. If the rich pageantry of thoughts must fade All unsubstantial as the regal hues Of eve which purpled them, our cunning frailty Must robe a living image with their pomp, And wreathe a diadem around its brow, In which our sunny fantasies may live Empearl'd, and gleam, in fatal splendor, far On after ages. We must look within For that which makes us slaves;âon sympathies Which find no kindred objects in the plain Of common lifeâaffections that aspire In air too thinâand fancy's dewy film Floating for rest; for even such delicate threads, Gather'd by fate's engrossing hand, supply The eternal spindle whence she weaves the bond Of cable strength in which our nature struggles! CTESIPHON. Go talk to others if thou wilt;âto me All argument, but that of steel, is idle. MEDON. No more;âlet's to the councilâthere, my son, Tell thy great message nobly;âand for thee Poor orphan'd youth, be sure the gods are just! [Exeunt. SCENE III. The great Square of the City. Adrastus seated on a throne; Agenor, Timocles, Cleon, and others, seated as CouncillorsâSoldiers line the stage at a distance. ADRASTUS. Upon your summons, Sages, I am here; Your king attends to know your pleasureâspeak it! AGENOR. And canst thou ask? If the heart dead within thee Receives no impress of this awful time, Art thou of sense forsaken? Are thine ears So charm'd by strains of slavish minstrelsy That the dull groan and frenzy-pointed shriek Pass them unheard to Heaven? Or are thine eyes So conversant with prodigies of grief They cease to dazzle at them? Art thou arm'd 'Gainst wonder, while, in all things, nature turns To dreadful contraries;âwhile Youth's full cheek Is shrivell'd into furrows of sad years, And 'neath its glossy curls untinged by care Looks out a keen anatomy;âwhile Age Is stung by feverish torture for an hour Into youth's strength;âwhile manly Sorrow steals From fragile girlishness hysteric tears;â While Womanhood, made hardy by despair, Starts into frightful courage, all unlike The gentle strength its gentle weakness feeds To make affliction beautiful, and stalks Abroad, a tearless, an unshuddering thing;â While Childhood, roaming parentless and free, Finds, in the shapes of wretchedness which seem Grotesque to its unsadden'd vision, cause For dreadful mirth that shortly shall be hush'd In never-broken silence; and while Love, Immortal through all change, makes ghastly Death Its idol of desire, and restless seeks, 'Mid images sepulchral, for the gauds To cheat its fancy with?âDo sights like these Glare through the realm thou shouldst be parent to, And canst thou find the voice to ask âour pleasure?â ADRASTUS. Cease, babbler;âwherefore would ye stun my ears With vain recital of the griefs I know, And cannot heal?âwill treason turn aside The shafts of fate, or cure the ills of nature? I have no skill in medicine, and no power To sway the elements. AGENOR. Thou hast the power To cast away thy flatterers; to put on Some show of pity for thy people's sorrows; To throw thyself upon the ground with them In lowly penitence; or, if this power Hath left a heart made weak by luxury And hard by pride, thou had at least the power To cease the mockery of thy frantic revels. ADRASTUS. I have yet power to punish insultâlook, I use it not, Agenor!âFate may dash My sceptre from me, but shall not command My will to hold it with a feebler grasp; Nay, if few hours of empire yet are mine, They shall be colored with a sterner pride, And peopled with more lustrous joys than flush'd In the serene procession of its greatness, Which look'd perpetual, as the flowing course Of human things. Have ye beheld a pine That clasp'd the mountain summit with a root As firm as its rough marble, and apart From the huge shade of undistinguish'd trees, Lifted its head as in delight to share The evening glories of the sky, and taste The wanton dalliance of the heavenly breeze That no ignoble vapour from the vale Could climb to mingle with,âin wild caprice Of frolic, Jove, smit by the thunder's marl And lighted for destruction? How it stood One glorious moment, fringed and wreathed with flame Which show'd the inward graces of its shape, Uncumber'd now, and midst its topmost boughs That young Ambition's airy fancies made Their giddy nest, leap'd sportive;ânever clad By liberal summer in a pomp so rich As waited on its downfall, while it took The storm-cloud roll'd behind it for a curtain To gird its splendors round, and made the blast Its minister to whirl its flashing shreds Aloft towards heaven, or to the startled depths Of forests that afar might share its doom! So shall the royalty of Argos pass In festal blaze to darkness. Have ye spoken? AGENOR. I speak no more to thee!âGreat Jove look down! [Shouting without.] ADRASTUS. What factious brawl is this?âdisperse it, soldiers. [Shouting renewedâAs some of the soldiers are about to march, Phocion rushes in, followed by Ctesiphon, Ion, and Medon.] Whence is this insolent intrusion? PHOCION. King! I bear Apollo's answer to thy prayer. ADRASTUS. Has not thy travel taught thy knee its duty? Here we had school'd thee better. PHOCION. Kneel to thee! MEDON. Patience, my son! Do homage to the king. PHOCION. Never!âthou talk'st of schoolingâknow, Adrastus, That I have studied in a nobler school Than the dull haunt of venal sophistry Or the lewd guard-room;âwhere the sky extends Its arch for all, and mocks the petty span Of earth-built palaces and dungeons; where The heart, beneath the meanest vestment, claims Alliance with diviner things than state Of monarchs or their minions, I have found My teachersâand their lessons make me blush To see a thousand of my fellows cringe Before a creature moulded like themselves In all things save in pity and in love. ADRASTUS. Peace! speak thy message. PHOCION. Shall I tell it here? Or shall I seek thy couch at dead of night And breathe it in low whispers?âAs thou wilt. ADRASTUS. Hereâand this instant! PHOCION. Harken then, Adrastus, And harken, Argivesâthus Apollo speaks! [Reads a scroll.] âArgos ne'er shall find release âTill her monarch's race shall cease.â ADRASTUS. 'Tis not the god, but man's sedition speaks:â Guards! tear that lying parchment from his hands, And bear him to the palace. MEDON. Touch him not,â He is Apollo's messenger, whose lips Were never stain'd with falsehood. PHOCION. Come on all! AGENOR. Surround him, friends! Die with him! ADRASTUS. Soldiers, charge Upon these rebels; hew them down. On, on! The Soldiers advance and surround the people; they seize Phocion. Ion rushes from the back of the stage, and throws himself between Adrastus and Phocion. Phocion to Adrastus. Yet I defy thee. ION. [To Phocion.] O my friend, forbear; For thy dear father's sakeâfor sake of allâ Enrage him notâone moment while I pleadâ [To Adrastus.] My sovereign, pause in thy rash course: thou art Here upon my entreaty, do not stain This sacred place with blood; in Heaven's great name I do conjure theeâand in hers, whose spirit Perchance is mourning for thee now! ADRASTUS. Release himâ Let him go spread his treason where he will, He is not worth my anger. To the palace! ION. Nay, yet an instant!âlet my speech have power From Heaven to move thee further: thou hast heard The sentence of the god, and thy heart owns it; If thou wilt cast aside this cumbrous pomp, And in seclusion purify thy soul Long fever'd and sophisticate, the gods May give thee space for penitential thoughts; If notâas surely as thou standest here, Wilt thou lie stiff and weltering in thy blood.â The vision presses on my soul. ADRASTUS. Art mad? Resign my state! Sue to the gods for life, The common life which every slave endures, And meanly clings to? No; within yon walls I shall resume the banquet, never more Broken by man's intrusion. Councillors, Farewell!âgo mutter treason till ye perish! [Exeunt Adrastus, Crythes, and Soldiers. Ion, who stands apart leaning on a pedestal. 'Tis seal'd! MEDON. Let us withdraw, and strive By sacrifice to pacify the gods! Medon, Agenor, and Councillors retire: they leave Ctesiphon, Phocion, and Ion. Ion still stands apart, as rapt in meditation. CTESIPHON. 'Tis well; the measure of his guilt is fill'd. Where shall we meet at sunset? PHOCION. In the grove Which with its matted shade imbrowns the vale, Between those buttresses of rock that guard The sacred mountain on its western side, Stands a rude altarâovergrown with moss, And stain'd with drippings of a million showers, So old, that no tradition names the power That hallow'd it,âwhich we will consecrate Anew to freedom and to justice. CTESIPHON. Thither Will I bring friends to meet thee. Shall we speak To yon rapt youth? [pointing to Ion. PHOCION. His nature is too gentle. At sunset we will meet.âWith arms? CTESIPHON. A knifeâ One sacrificial knife will serve. PHOCION. At sunset! [Exeunt Ctesiphon and Phocion severally. Ion comes forward. ION. O wretched man, thy words have seal'd thy doom! Why should I shiver at it, when no way, Save this, remains to break the ponderous cloud That hangs above my wretched country?âdeathâ A single death, the common lot of all, Which it will not be mine to look upon,â And yet its ghastly shape dilates before me; I cannot shut it out; my thoughts grow rigid, And as that grim and prostrate figure haunts them, My sinews stiffen like it. Courage, Ion! No spectral form is here; all outward things Wear their own old familiar looks; no dye Pollutes them. Yet the air has scent of blood, And now it eddies with a hurtling sound, As if some weapon swiftly clove it. Noâ The falchion's course is silent as the grave That yawns before its victim. Gracious powers! If the great duty of my life be near, Grant it may be to suffer, not to strike! [Exit. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A terrace of the Temple. CLEMANTHE, ION. CLEMANTHE. Nay, I must chide this sorrow from thy brow, Or 'twill rebuke my happiness;âI know Too well the miseries that hem us round, And yet the inward sunshine of my soul, Unclouded by their melancholy shadows, Bathes in its deep tranquillity one imageâ One only image, which no outward storm Can ever ruffle. Let me wean thee, then, From this vain pondering o'er the general woe, Which makes my joy look ugly. ION. No, my fair one, The gloom that wrongs thy love is unredeem'd By generous sense of others' woe: too sure It rises from dark presages within, And will not from me. CLEMANTHE. Then it is most groundless! Hast thou not won the blessings of the perishing By constancy, the fame of which shall live While a heart beats in Argos?âhast thou not Upon one agitated bosom pour'd The sweetest peace? and can thy generous nature, While it thus sheds felicity around it, Remain itself unbless'd? ION. I fain would think That the assured possession of thy love With too divine a freitage weigh'd my heart And press'd my spirits down;âbut 'tis not so; Nor will I with false tenderness beguile thee, By feigning that my sadness has a cause So exquisite. Clemanthe! thou wilt find me A sad companion;âI who knew not life, Save as the sportive breath of happiness, Now feel my minutes teeming, as they rise, With grave experiences; I dream no more In sleep or mood serene, of azure fields Which rainbow palaces invest, but vaults In long succession open till the gloom Afar is broken by a streak of fire That shapes my nameâthe moaning wind that creeps Prophetic of the tempest whispers it; And as I pass'd but now the solemn range Of Argive monarchs, that in sculptured mockery Of present empire sit, their eyes of stone Bent on me instinct with a frightful life That drew me into fellowship with them, As conscious marble; while their ponderous lipsâ Fit organs of eternityâunclosed, And, as I live to tell thee, murmur'd âHail! Hail! Ion the Devoted!â CLEMANTHE. These are fancies Which thy soul, late expanded with great purpose, Shapes, as it quivers to its natural circle In which its joys should lurk, as in the bud The cells of fragrance cluster. Bid them from thee, And strive to be thyself. ION. I will do so! I'll gaze upon thy loveliness, and drink Its quiet in;âhow beautiful thou art!â Sure my pulse throbs as it was wont;âa being, Which owns so fair a glass to mirror it, Cannot show darkly. CLEMANTHE. Happiness will soon Revisit us; my father will rejoiceâ I feel he will, to bless our love; and Argos Will breathe again, for her destroyer's course Must have a speedy end. ION. It must! It must! CLEMANTHE. Yes; for no idle talk of public wrongs Assails him now; keen hatred and revenge Are roused to crush him. ION. Not by such base agents May the august lustration be achieved: He who shall cleanse his country from the guilt For which Heaven smites her, should be pure of soul, Guileless as infancy, and undisturb'd By personal anger as thy father is When with unswerving hand and piteous eye He stops the brief life of the innocent kid Bound with white fillets to the altar;âso Enwreath'd by fate the royal victim stands, And soon his breast shall shrink beneath the knife Of the selected slayer! CLEMANTHE. 'Tis thyself Whom thy strange language picturesâIon! thouâ ION. She has said it! Her pure lips have spoken out What all things intimate;âdidst thou not mark Me for the office of avengerâme? CLEMANTHE. No;âsave from the wild picture that thy fancyâ Thy o'erwrought fancy drew; I thought it look'd Too like thee, and I shudder'd. ION. So do I! And yet I almost wish I shudder'd more, For the dire thought has grown familiar with meâ Could I escape it! CLEMANTHE. 'Twill away in sleep. ION. No, no! I dare not sleepâfor well I know That then the knife will gleam, the blood will gush, The form will stiffen!âI will walk awhile In the sweet evening light, and try to chase These fearful images away. CLEMANTHE. Let me Go with thee. O, how often hand in hand In such a lovely light have we roam'd westward Aimless and blessed, when we were no more Than playmates:âsurely we are not grown stranger Since yesterday! ION. No, dearest, not to-night: The plague yet rages fiercely in the vale, And I am placed in grave commission here To watch the gates;âindeed thou must not pass; I will be merrier when we meet again,â Trust me, my love, I will; farewell! [Exit ION. CLEMANTHE. Farewell then! How fearful disproportion shows in one Whose life hath been all harmony! I fear Some power malignant working on his soul May drive him into frenzied act: he bends Towards that thick covert where in blessed hour My father found him, which has ever been His chosen place of meditation; thither I'll follow him:âindeed I would not grow A selfish mistress jealous of his musings; But when dark fancies trouble his clear spirit, Sure 'tis my privilege to hover near him! [Exit. SCENE II. An opening in a deep woodâin front an old grey altar. Enter Ion. ION. O winding pathways, o'er whose scanty blades Of unaspiring grass mine eyes have bent So often when by musing fancy sway'd, That craved alliance with no wider scene That your fair thickets border'd, but was pleased To deem the toilsome years of manhood flown, And, on the pictured mellowness of age Idly reflective, image my return From careful wanderings, to find ye gleam With unchanged aspect on a heart unchanged, And melt the busy past to a sweet dream As then the future was;âwhy should ye now Echo my steps with melancholy sound As ye were conscious of a guilty presence? The lovely light of even that, as it waned Touch'd ye with softer, homelier look, now fades In dismal blackness; and yon twisted roots Of ancient trees, with whose fantastic forms My thoughts grew humorous, look terrible As if about to start to serpent life And hiss around me;âwhither shall I turnâ Where fly?âI see the myrtle-cradled spot Where human love instructed by divine Found and embraced me first; I'll cast me down Upon that earth as on a mother's breast, In hope to feel myself again a child. [Ion goes into the wood. Enter Ctesiphon, Cassander, and other Argive youths. CTESIPHON. Sure this must be the place that Phocion spoke of;â The twilight deepens, yet he does not come. O, if instead of idle dreams of freedom, He knew the sharpness of a grief like mine, He would not linger thus! CASSANDER. The sun's broad disk Of misty red, a few brief minutes since, Sunk 'neath the leaden wave; but night steals on With rapid pace to veil us, and thy thoughts Are eager as the ominous darkness. Enter Phocion. CTESIPHON. Welcome! Thou knowest all here. PHOCION. Yes; I rejoice, Cassander, To find thee my companion in a deed Worthy of all the dreamings of old days, When we, two rebel youths, grew safely brave In visionary perils. We'll not shame Our young imaginations. Ctesiphon, We look to thee for guidance in our aim. CTESIPHON. I bring you glorious news. There is a soldier Who, in his reckless boyhood, was my comrade, And though by taste of luxury subdued Even to brook the tyrant's service, burns With generous anger to avenge that grief I bear above all others. He has made The retribution sure. From him I learnt That when Adrastus reach'd his palace court, He paused, to struggle with some mighty throe Of awful passion; then, as if resolved To conquer thought, call'd eagerly for wine, And bade his soldiers share his choicest stores, And snatch, like him, a day from fortune. Soon As one worn out by watching and excess, He stagger'd to his couch, where now he lies Oppress'd with heavy sleep, while his loose soldiers, Made by the fierce carousal vainly mad Or grossly dull, are scatter'd through the courts Unarm'd and cautionless. The eastern portal Is at this moment open; by that gate We all may enter unperceived, and line The passages which gird the royal chamber, While one sure hand within completes the doom Which Heaven pronounces. Nothing now remains, But that as all would share this action's glory, We join in one great vow, and choose one arm Our common minister. O, should my sorrows Confer on me the office to return Upon the tyrant's shivering heart the blow Which crushed my father's spirit, I will leave To him who cares for toysâthe patriot's laurel And the applause of ages! PHOCION. Let the gods By the old course of lot reveal the name Of the predestined champion. For myself, Here do I solemnly devote all powers Of soul and body to that glorious purpose We live but to fulfil. CTESIPHON. And I! CASSANDER. And I! ION. [Who has advanced from the wood, rushes to the altar and exclaims] And I! PHOCION. Ion! thou art most welcome; sure the gods In prompting thy unspotted soul to join Our bloody councils, sanctify and bless them! ION. Yes; they have prompted me; for they have given One dreadful voice to all things which should be Else dumb or musical; and I rejoice To step from the grim round of waking dreams Into a fellowship which makes all clear. Wilt trust me, Ctesiphon? CTESIPHON. Yes; but we waste The precious minutes in vain talk; if lots Must guide us, have ye scrolls? PHOCION. Cassander has them; The flickering light of yonder glade will serve him To inscribe them with our names. Be quick, Cassander! CTESIPHON. I wear a casque, beneath whose iron circlet My father's dark hairs whiten'd; let it hold The names of his avengers! [Ctesiphon takes off his helmet and gives it to Cassander, who retires with it.] PHOCION [to Ctesiphon]. He whose name Thou shalt draw first shall fill the post of glory. Were it not also well the second name Should designate another charged to take The same great office, if the first should leave His work imperfect. CTESIPHON. There can scarce be need; Yet as thou wilt. May the first chance be mine; I will leave little for a second arm! [Cassander returns with the helmet. CTESIPHON. Now gods decide! [Ctesiphon draws a lot from the helmet. PHOCION. The name? Why dost thou pause? CTESIPHON. 'Tis Ion! ION. Well, I knew it would be mine! [Ctesiphon draws another lot. CTESIPHON. Phocion! it will be thine to strike him dead If he should prove faint-hearted. PHOCION. With my life I'll answer for his constancy. CTESIPHON. [to Ion. Thy hand! 'Tis cold as death. ION. Yes; but it is as firm. What ceremony next? [Ctesiphon leads Ion to the altar and gives him a knife. CTESIPHON. Receive this steel For ages dedicate in my sad home To sacrificial uses; grasp it nobly, And consecrate it to untrembling service Against the king of Argos and his race. ION. His race! Is he not left alone on earth? He hath no brother and no child. CTESIPHON. Such words The god hath used who never speaks in vain. PHOCION. There were old rumours of an infant born And strangely vanishing;âa tale of guilt Half-hush'd, perchance distorted in the hushing, And by the wise scarce heeded, for they deem'd it One of a thousand guilty histories Which, if the walls of palaces could speak, Would show that nursed by prideful luxury, To pamper which the virtuous peasant toils, Crimes grow unpunish'd which the pirates' nest, Or want's foul hovel, or the cell which Justice Keeps for unlicensed guilt would startle at! We must root out the stock that no stray scion Renew the tree whose branches, stifling virtue, Shed poison-dews on joy. [Ion approaches the altar, and, lifting up the knife, speaks. Ye eldest gods, Who in no statues of exactest form Are palpable; who shun the azure heights Of beautiful Olympus and the sound Of ever-young Apollo's minstrelsy; Yet, mindful of the empire which ye held Over dim Chaos, keep revengeful watch On falling nations, and on kingly lines About to sink for ever; ye, who shed Into the passions of earth's giant brood And their fierce usages the sense of Justice; Who clothe the fated battlements of tyranny With blackness as a funeral pall, and breathe Through the proud halls of time-embolden'd guilt Portents of ruin, hear me!âIn your presence, For now I feel ye nighâI dedicate This arm to the destruction of the king And of his race! O keep me pityless, Expel all human weakness from my frame, That this keen weapon shake not when his heart Should feel its point; and if he has a child Whose blood is needful to the sacrifice My country asks, harden my soul to shed it!â Was not that thunder? CTESIPHON. No; I heard no sound. Now mark me, Ion!âthou shalt straight be led To the king's chamber; we shall be at hand; Nothing can give thee pause. Hold! one should watch The city's eastern portal, lest the troops Returning from the work of plunder home Surround us unprepared. Be that thy duty. [To Phocion. PHOCION. I am to second Ion if he fail. CTESIPHON. He cannot fail;âI shall be nigh. What, Ion! ION. Who spake to me? Where am I? Friends, your pardon; I am prepared; yet grant me for a moment, Only a moment, to be left alone. CTESIPHON. Be brief then, or the season of revenge Will pass. At yonder thicket we'll expect thee. [Exeunt all but Ion. ION. Methinks I breathe more freely, now my lot Is palpable, and mortals gird me round, Though my soul owns no sympathy with theirs. Some one approachesâI must hide this knifeâ Hide! I have ne'er till now had ought to hide From any human eye. [He conceals the knife in his vest. Enter Clemanthe. Clemanthe here! CLEMANTHE. Forgive me that I break upon thee thus; I meant to watch thy steps unseen; but night Is thickening; thou art haunted by sad fancies, And 'tis more terrible to think upon thee Wandering with such companions in thy bosom, Than in the peril thou art wont to seek Beside the bed of death. ION. Death, sayest thou? Death? Is it not righteous when the gods decree it? And brief its sharpest agony? Yet, fairest, It is no theme for thee. Prithee go in, And think of it no more. CLEMANTHE. Not without thee. Indeed thou art not well; thy hands are marble, Thy eyes are fix'd; let me support thee, love,â Ha! what is that gleaming within thy vest? A knife! Tell me its purpose, Ion! ION. No; My oath forbids. CLEMANTHE. An oath! O gentle Ion, What can have link'd thee to a cause which needs A stronger cement than a good man's word? Hast not install'd me in thy soul's high palace, And wilt thou keep one churlish corner from me? ION. Alas, I must. Thou wilt know all full soonâ [Voices call Ion!] Hark, I am call'd! CLEMANTHE. Nay, do not leave me thus. ION. 'Tis very sad [voices again]âI dare not stayâfarewell! [Exit. CLEMANTHE. It must be to Adrastus that he hastes! 'Tis fit the tyrant die, but not by him; For black remembrance of the deed will hang Upon his delicate spirit like a cloud, And tinge its world of happy images With hues of horror. Shall I to the palace, And, as the price of my disclosure, claim His safety? No!â'Tis never woman's part Out of her fond misgivings to perplex The fortunes of the man to whom she cleaves; 'Tis hers to weave all that she has of fair And bright in the dark meshes of their web Inseparate from their windings. My poor heart Hath found its refuge in a hero's love, Whatever destiny his generous soul Shape for him;â'tis its duty to be still, And trust him till it bound or break with his. [Exit. SCENE III. A chamber in the Temple. Enter Medon, followed by Abra. MEDON. My daughter not within the temple, sayst thou? Abroad at such an hour? Sure not alone She wander'd: tell me truly, did not Phocion Or Ion bear her company? 'twas Ionâ Confess;âwas it not he? I shall not chide, Indeed I shall not. ABRA. She went forth alone; But it is true that Ion just before Had taken the same path. MEDON. It was to meet him. I would they were return'd; the night is grown Of an unusual blackness. Some one comesâ Look if it be my daughter. Abra looking out. No; young Irus, The little slave, whose pretty tale of grief Agenor, with so gracious a respect, This morning told us. MEDON. Let him come; he bears Some message from his master. Enter Irus. Medon to Irus. Thou art pale; Has any evil happened to Agenor? IRUS. No, my good lord, I do not come from him; I bear to thee a scroll from one who now Is number'd with the dead; an humble man, Who was the last akin to me on earth, But whom I never saw until he lay Upon his deathbed; he had left these shores Long before I was born, and no one knew His place of exile;âon this mournful day He landed, was plague-stricken, and expired. My gentle master gave me leave to tend His else unsolaced death-bed;âwhen he found The clammy chilness of the grave steal on, He call'd for parchment, and with trembling hand, That seem'd to gather firmness from its task, Wrote earnestly; conjured me take the scroll Instant to thee; and died. [Irus gives a scroll to Medon. Medon reading the scroll. These are high tidings. Abra! is not Clemanthe come? I long To tell her all. Enter Clemanthe. MEDON. Sit down, my pensive child. Abra, this boy is faint, see him refresh'd With food and wine before he quit the temple. IRUS. I have too long been absent from Agenor, Who needs my slender help. MEDON. Nay, I will use Thy master's firmness here, and use it so As he would use it. Keep him prisoner, Abra, Till he has done my bidding. [Exeunt Abra and Irus. Now, Clemanthe, Though thou hast play'd the truant and the rebel, I will not be severe in my award By keeping from thee news of one to thee Most dearânay, do not blushâI say most dear. CLEMANTHE. It is of Ion;ânoâI do not blush, But tremble. O my father, what of Ion? MEDON. How often have we guess'd his lineage noble! And now 'tis proved. The uncle of that youth Was with another hired to murder him A babe;âthey tore him from his mother's breast, And to a sea-girt summit, where a rock O'erhung a chasm by the surge's force Made terrible, rush'd with him. As the gods In mercy order'd it, the foremost ruffian Who bore no burden, pressing through the gloom In the wild hurry of his guilty purpose, Trod at the extreme verge upon a crag Loosen'd by summer from its granite bed, And suddenly fell with it;âwith his fall Sunk the base daring of the man who held The infant; so he placed the unconscious babe Upon the spot where it was found by me; Watch'd till he saw the infant safe; then fled, Fearful of question; and return'd to die. That child is Ion; whom do'st guess his sire? The first in Argos. CLEMANTHE. Dost thou mean Adrastus? He cannotâmust notâbe that tyrant's son! MEDON. It is most certain. Nay, my thankless girl, He hath no touch of his rash father's pride, For Nature, from whose genial lap he smiled Upon us first, hath moulded for her own The suppliant of her bounty. I have read His inmost spirit from that hour, and feel No change will make him tyrant to the state, Or traitor to his love;âthou art bless'd, Clemantheâ Thus, let me bid thee joy. CLEMANTHE. Joy, sayst thouâjoy! Then I must speakâhe seeks Adrastus' life; And at this moment, while we talk, may stain His soul with parricide. MEDON. Impossible! Ion, the gentlestâ CLEMANTHE. It is true, my father; I saw the weapon gleaming in his vest; I heard him call'd! MEDON. Shall I alarm the palace! CLEMANTHE. No; in the fierce confusion, he would fall Before our tale could be his safeguard. Gods! Is there no hope, no refuge? MEDON. Yes, if Heaven Assist us. I bethink me of a passage Which, fashion'd by a king in pious zeal, That he might seek the altar of the god In secret, from the temple's inmost shrine Leads to the royal chamber. I have track'd it In youth for pastime. Could I thread it now, I yet might save him. CLEMANTHE. O make haste, my father; Shall I attend thee? MEDON. No; thou wouldst impede My steps;âthou art fainting; when I have lodged thee safe In thy own chamber, I will light the torch And instantly set forward. CLEMANTHE. Do not waste An instant's space on me;âspeed, speed, my fatherâ The fatal moments fly; I need no aid;â Thou seest I am calm, quite calm. MEDON. The gods protect thee! [Exeunt severally. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Royal Chamber. Adrastus on a couch asleep. Enter Ion with the knife. ION. Why do I creep thus stealthily along With thief-like steps? Am I not arm'd by Heaven To execute its justice on a life Above the reach of mortal law? And now, Call'd to this awful duty, shall I shrink, While every moment that it lasts may crush Some life else happy?âMay I be deceived, Lured by the specious form of noble daring, Which some foul passion, crouching in my soul, Roused from long ambush, borrows to undo me? Assure me, gods!âYes; I have heard your voices Aright, for I dare pray ye to look down And see me stab! [He goes to the couch. He's smiling in his slumber, As if some happy thought of innocent days Play'd at his heartstrings: must I scare it thence With mortal agonies? This pity's selfish: Be firm, my soul!âYet I'll not filch his life Thus while he sleeps: he is a culprit doom'd By the high judgment of supernal Powers, And he shall know their sentence. Wake, Adrastus! Collect thy spirits, and be strong to die! ADRASTUS. Who dares disturb my rest? Guards! Soldiers! Recreants! Where tarry ye? Why smite ye not to earth This bold intruder?âHa! no weapon here!â What wouldst thou with me, ruffian? [Rising. ION. I am none, But a sure instrument in Jove's great hand To take thy forfeit life;âso make thee ready; Thy hour is come! ADRASTUS. Villains! does no one hear? ION. Vex not the closing minutes of thy being With torturing hope or idle rage; thy guards, Palsied with revelry, are scatter'd senseless, While the most valiant of our Argive youths Hold every passage by which human aid Could reach thee. Thou art doom'd to present death By Powers above thy state, and I am sent To execute their pleasure. ADRASTUS. Thou!âI know theeâ The youth I spared this morning, in whose ear I pour'd the secrets of my bosom. Kill me, If thou darest do it, but bethink thee first How the grim memory of thy thankless deed Will haunt thee to the grave! ION. It is most true; Thou sparedst my life, and therefore do the gods Ordain me to this office, lest thy fall Seem the chance forfeit of some single sin, And not the great redress of Argos. Nature, The human nature thou hast vex'd and scoff'd at, Cries out to Heaven against theeâHeaven attends, And answers it by me! I shall perform Its bidding firmly, yet with such sad grace As the law's minister to common men Is privileged to show. If there is one Whom dying thou wouldst greet by word or token, Speak, and believe it done. ADRASTUS. I have no friend; If thou hast courage, strike! ION. Without a friend! Most lonely man! ADRASTUS. Ha! thou art melted! ION. Hope not Aught from my weak reluctance; should I spare thee, My comrades will be masters of our lives, And we shall fall together. Be it so! ADRASTUS. Never; I'll yield to thee alone; dispatch! I recognise in thee Jove's minister, And, kneeling thus, submit me to his power. [Adrastus kneels. ION. Avert thy face. ADRASTUS. No; let me meet thy gaze; For breathing pity lights thy features up Into more awful likeness of a form Which once shone on me;âand which now my sense Shapes palpableâin habit of the grave, Inviting me to the lone shore where night Shall compass us;â'tis surely there;âshe waves Her pallid hand in circle o'er thy head, As if to bless theeâand I bless thee too, Death's gracious angel!âDo not turn away. ION. Gods! to what office have ye doom'd me;ânow! [Ion raises his arm to stab Adrastus, who is kneeling, and gazes steadfastly upon him. The voice of Medon is heard without, calling Ion! Ion!âIon drops his arm.] ADRASTUS. Be quick, or thou art lost! [As Ion has again raised his arm to strike, Medon rushes in behind him.] MEDON. Ion, forbear! Behold thy son, Adrastus! [Ion stands for a moment stupified with horror, drops the knife, and falls senseless on the ground.] ADRASTUS. What strange words Are these which call my senses from the death They were composed to welcome. Son! 'tis falseâ I had but one, and the deep wave rolls o'er him! MEDON. That wave received, instead of the fair nurseling, One of the slaves who bore him from thy sight In wicked haste to slay;âI'll give thee proofs. ADRASTUS. Great Jove, I thank thee!âraise him gentlyâproofs! Are there not here the lineaments of her Who made me happy onceâthe voice, now still, That bade the long-seal'd fount of love gush out, While with a prince's constancy he came To lay his noble life down; and the last, The dreadful, certain proof, that he whose frame Is instinct with her spirit, stood above me, Arm'd for the traitor's deed!âIt is my child! [Ion reviving, sinks on one knee before Adrastus.] ION. Father! [Noise without.] MEDON. The clang of arms! Ion. [Starting up.] They come! they come! They who are leagued with me against thy life. Here let us fall! ADRASTUS. I will confront them yet; Within I have a weapon which has drank A traitor's blood ere now;âthere will I wait them: Comeânought but death shall separate us more. [Exeunt Adrastus and Ion as to an inner chamber. MEDON. Have mercy on him, gods, for the dear sake Of your most single-hearted worshipper! Enter Ctesiphon, Cassander, and others. CTESIPHON. What treachery is thisâthe tyrant fled, And Ion fled too!âComrades, stay this dotard While I search yonder chamber. MEDON. Spare him, friends,â O let him live to clasp his new-found son; Spare him as Ion's father! CTESIPHON. Father! yesâ That is indeed a name to bid me spare;â Let me but find him, gods! [He rushes into the inner chamber. Medon. [To Cassander and the others.] Had ye but seen What I have witness'd, ye would weep with him. Crythes enters with soldiers. Ha, Crythes! hasten to defend your master; That wayâ [As Crythes is about to enter the inner chamber, Ctesiphon rushes from it with a bloody dagger and stops them.] CTESIPHON. It is accomplish'd; the foul blot Is wiped away. Stern shadow of my father, Look on thy son, and smile! CRYTHES. Whose blood is that? It cannot be the king's! CTESIPHON. It cannot be? Think'st, thou foul minion of a tyrant's will, He was to crush, and thou to crawl for ever? Look there, and tremble! CRYTHES. Wretch! thy life shall pay The forfeit of thy deed. [Crythes and soldiers seize Ctesiphon. [Enter Adrastus mortally wounded, supported by Ion.] ADRASTUS. Here let me rest,â In this old chamber did my life begin, And here I'll end it: Crythes! thou hast timed Thy visit well, to bring thy soldiers hither To gaze upon my parting. CRYTHES. To avenge thee;â Here is the murderous traitor! ADRASTUS. Set him free.â Why do ye not obey me? Ctesiphon, Thou hadst just cause for this;âmy death is sure; And as thou hast requited me, I sue For a small boonâlet me not see thee more. CTESIPHON. Farewell! [Exit Ctesiphon. Adrastus [to Crythes and the soldiers.] Why do ye tarry here? Begone!âstill do ye hover round my couch? If the commandment of a dying king Is feeble, as a man who has embraced His child for the first time since infancy, And presently must part with him for ever, I do adjure ye leave us! [Exeunt all but Ion and Adrastus. ION. O my father, How is it with thee now? ADRASTUS. Well; very well;â Avenging Fate hath spent its utmost force Against me; and I gaze upon my son With the sweet certainty that nought can part us Till all is quiet here. How like a dream Seems the succession of my regal pomps Since I embraced thy helplessness! To me The interval hath been a weary one; How hath it pass'd with thee? ION. But that my heart Hath sometimes ached for the sweet sense of kindred, I had enjoy'd a round of happy years As cherish'd youth e'er knew. ADRASTUS. I bless the gods That they have strewn along thy humble path Delights unblamed; and in this hour I seem Even as I had lived so; and I feel That I shall live in thee, unless that curseâ O if it should survive me! ION. Think not of it; The gods have shed such sweetness in this moment, That, howsoever they deal with me hereafter, I shall not deem them angry. Let me call For help to staunch thy wound; thou art strong yet, And yet may live to bless me. ADRASTUS. Do not stir; My strength is ebbing fast, yet as it leaves me The spirit of my stainless days of love Awakens; and their images of joy, Which at thy voice started from blank oblivion, When thou wert strange to me, and then half-shown Look'd sadly through the mist of guilty years, Now glimmer on me in the lovely light Which at thy age they wore. Thou art all thy mother's, Her elements of gentleness enshrined In an heroic casing. ION. Thou art faint; Can I do nothing for thee? ADRASTUS. Yes;âmy son, Thou art the best, the bravest, of a race Of rightful monarchs; thou must mount the throne Thy ancestors have fill'd, and by thy goodness Efface the memory of thy fated sire, And win the blessing of the gods for men Stricken for him. Swear to me thou wilt do this, And I shall die forgiven. ION. I will. ADRASTUS. Rejoice, Sufferers of Argos! I am growing weak, And my eyes dazzle; let me rest my hands, Ere they have lost their feeling, on thy head.â So! So!âthy hair is glossy to the touch As when I last enwreath'd its tiny curl About my finger; I did image then Thy reign succeeding mine; and now I die Contented as I hail thee king of Argos! [Dies. ION. He's dead! and I am fatherless again.â King did he hail me? shall I make that word A spell to bid old happiness awake Throughout the lovely land that father'd me In my forsaken childhood? [He sees the knife on the ground, and takes it up. Most vain dream! This austere monitor hath bid thee vanish Ere half reveal'd. Come back, thou truant steel; Half of thy work the gods absolved thee from, The rest remains! Lie there! [He puts the knife in his bosom. Shouts heard without. The voice of joy! Is this thy funeral wailing? O my father! Mournful and brief will be the heritage Thou leavest me; yet I promised thee in death To grasp it;âand I will embrace it now. Enter Agenor and others. AGENOR. Does the king live? ION. Alas! in me. The son Of him whose princely spirit is at rest, Claims his ancestral honours. AGENOR. The high thought Anticipates the prayer of Argos roused To sudden joy. The sages wait without To greet thee;âwilt confer with them to-night Or wait the morning? ION. Now;âthe city's state Allows the past no sorrow. I attend them. [Exeunt. SCENE II. [Before the gate of the city.] [Phocion on guard.] PHOCION. Fool that I was to take this idle office At most inglorious distance from the scene Which shall be freedom's birth-place; to endure The phantasies of danger which the soul Uncheer'd by action coldly dallies with Till it begins to shiver! Long ere this, If Ion's hand be firm, the deed is past, And yet no shout announces that the bonds Of tyranny are broken. [Shouts at distance. Hark! 'tis done!â Enter Ctesiphon. All hail, my brother freeman!âis't not so?â Thy looks are haggardâis the tyrant slain? Is liberty achieved? CTESIPHON. The king is dead; This arm,âI bless the vengeful Furies!âslew him. PHOCION. Did Ion quail then? CTESIPHON. Ion!âclothe thy speech In phrase more courtly; he is king of Argos, Accepted as the tyrant's long-lost son, And in his person still the murderer reigns. PHOCION. It cannot be; I can believe his birth Is royal, yet I know he will prefer His own internal treasury of sweet thoughts To all the frigid glories that invest The loveless state in which the monarch dwells A terror and a slave. [Shouts again. CTESIPHON. Dost hear that shout? 'Tis raised for him!âthe craven fools rejoice To welcome a new masterâthe loose soldiers From the base instinct of their slavish trade Which must be deck'd and master'd; the slight people In hunger for a holiday; the elders Confounded by the wisdom of his speech; Join in one prayer that he would set his foot Upon their necks, and he is pleased to grant it. PHOCION. He shall not grant it! If my life, my sense, My heart's affections and my tongue's free scope Wait the dominion of a mortal will, What is the sound to meâwhether my soul Bears âIonâ or âAdrastusâ burnt within it As my soul's owner? One, in cruel whim, May shape new tortures for my quivering nerves, Or strain my sinews to beguile an hour; The other may be gracious in caprice, And from the store great nature gave to all men Dole out small bounties to adoring slaves; If I must choose, give me the honest tyrant, Whom in my dungeon I am free to curse, Whose bounties seek not to immesh the soul, And claim it his accomplice! Ion, kingâ Never; I'll reason with his guileless heart, Which has not known a selfish impulse yet, And thou shalt see him smile this greatness from him. CTESIPHON. Go teach the eagle when in azure heaven He upward darts to seize his madden'd prey, Shivering through the death-circle of its fear, To pause and let it 'scape, and thou mayst win Man to forego the sparkling round of power, When it floats airily within his grasp. PHOCION. Why dost thou argue this so sternly? thou Carest not for general wrongs; and thy own grief Is well avenged. CTESIPHON. Not while the son of him Who smote my father reigns. I little guess'd Thou wouldst require a prompter to awake The memory of the oath of yesterday, Or of the place assign'd to thee by lot, Should our first champion fail to crush the raceâ Mark me!ââthe raceâ of him my arm has dealt with. Now is the time; the palace all confused, And the prince dizzy with strange turns of fortune To do thy part. PHOCION. Have mercy on my weakness! If thou hadst known this youth as I have known him, One of the same small household which he cheer'd With cloudless mirth;âvex'd him a thousand times, And never felt the chiding of a glance; Seen him anticipate thy wayward wishes As by sweet instinct, and o'ertax his strength To gratify themâif thou hast been stretch'd Long weeks upon a couch of agony, And felt the blessing of his gentle care, Thou couldst not do it.âHear me, Ctesiphon!â I had a deadly fever once, and slaves Shrunk tremblingâhe watch'd o'er me with patience Which seem'd to draw enjoyment from its use, And soothed my dull ear with discourse so sweet, That lovely fancies throng'd about my soul, And my sad room became a place enchanted, Its darkness swarming with delightful shapes, That almost stole away the sense of pain;â And canst thou bid me slay him now? CTESIPHON. The task Be mine. Thou wilt not play the traitor with me? [going. PHOCION. Hold! If the compact of our dreadful league Require that he should fall, I will not wait At distance;âsince my thought must be his stabber, My arm shall not be absent. CTESIPHON. Thou wilt find him, Haply upon the terrace and alone; But hasten. PHOCION. O fear not that I should bear The prospect of so sad an office long. CTESIPHON. That done, I'll meet thee at the temple. PHOCION. Well! All places will be then alike to me. [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. [A Terrace in the Garden of the Palace by moonlight.] [Enter Ion and Agenor.] AGENOR. Wilt thou not in to rest? ION. My rest is hereâ For rising from the shocks of circumstance, My soul, in presence of the starry heavens, Can feel the littleness of earthly change And bear its fortunes tranquilly. Yet age Requires more genial nourishmentâpray seek itâ I will but stay thee to inquire once more If any symptom of returning health Bless the wan city? AGENOR. Noâthe perishing Lift up their painful heads to bless thy name, And their eyes kindle as they utter it; But still they perish. ION. So!âgive instant order, The rites which shall confirm me in my throne Be solemnized to-morrow. AGENOR. How! so soon, While the more sacred duties to the dead Remain unpaid? ION. Let them abide my timeâ They will not tarry long. I see thee gaze With wonder on meâdo my bidding now, And trust me till to-morrow. Pray go in, The night will chill thee else. AGENOR. Farewell, my lord! [Exit. ION. Now all is stillness in my breastâhow soon To be displaced by more profound repose, In which no thread of consciousness shall live To feel how calm it is!âO lamp serene, Do I lift up to thee undazzled eyes For the last time? Shall I enjoy no more Thy golden haziness which seem'd akin To my young fortune's dim felicity? And when it coldly shall embrace the urn That shall contain my ashes, will not one Of all the fancies cherish'd by thy beams Awake to tremble with them? Vain regret! The pathway of my duty lies in sunlight, And I would tread it with as firm a step, Though it should terminate in cold oblivion, As if Elysian pleasures at its close Gleam'd palpable to sight as things of earth. Who passes there? Enter Phocion behind, who strikes at Ion with a dagger. PHOCION. This to the king of Argos. [Ion struggles with him, seizes the dagger, which he throws away.] ION. I will not fall by thee, poor wavering novice In the assassin's trade!âthy arm is feebleâ [He confronts Phocion. Phocion!âwas this well aim'd? thou didst not meanâ PHOCION. I meant to take thy life, urged by remembrance Of yesterday's great vow. ION. And couldst thou think I had forgotten? PHOCION. Thou! ION. Couldst thou believe That one whose nature had been arm'd to stop The life-blood's current in a fellow's veins Would hesitate when gentler duty turn'd His steel to nearer use? To-morrow's dawn Shall see me wield the sceptre of our line; Come, watch beside my throne, and, if I fail In sternest duty which my country needs, My bosom will be open to thy dagger As now to thy embrace! PHOCION. Thus let me fall Low at thy feet, and kneeling here receive Forgiveness; do not crush with more love Than lies in the word âpardon.â ION. And that word I will not speak;âwhat have I to forgive? A devious fancy, and a muscle raised Obedient to its impulse! Dost thou think That in this moment's error are effaced The tracings of a thousand kindnesses Which taught me all I guess'd of brotherhood? PHOCION. I cannot look upon thee; let me go And lose myself in darkness. ION. Nay, old playmate, We part not thusâthe duties of my state Will shortly end our fellowship; but spend A few glad minutes with me. Dost remember How in a night like this we climb'd yon walls Two vagrant urchins, and with tremulous joy Skimm'd through these statue-border'd walks that gleam'd In bright succession? Let us tread them now; And think we are but older by a day, And that the pleasant walk of yesternight We are to-night retracing. Come, my friend!â What drooping yetâthou wert not wont to seem So stubbornâcheerily, my Phocionâcome! [Exeunt. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. TIME.âTHE MORNING OF THE SECOND DAY. [The Terrace of the Palace.] [Two Soldiers on guard.] 1 SOLDIER. A stirring season, comrade! our new prince Has leap'd as eagerly into his seat As he had languish'd an expectant heir Weary of nature's kindness to old age. He was esteem'd a modest stripling;âstrange That he should, with unusual hurry, seize The gaudy shows of power. 2 SOLDIER. 'Tis honest nature; The royal instinct was but smouldering in him, And now it blazes forth. I pray the gods He may not give us cause to mourn his sire. 1 SOLDIER. No more; he comes. [Enter Ion.] ION. Why do ye loiter here? Are all the statues deck'd with festal wreaths As I commanded? 1 SOLDIER. We have been on guard Here by Agenor's order since the nightfall. ION. On guard! Well, hasten now and see it done; I need no guards. [Exeunt Soldiers. The awful hour draws near; I am composed to meet it.âPhocion comes. His presence, once so welcome, will unman me, And yet I must not vex his generous soul With thought that he has ruffled mine. [Enter Phocion.] Good morrow! Thou play'st the courtier early. PHOCION. Canst thou speak In that old tone of common cheerfulness, That falsely promises delightful years, And hold thy mournful purpose? ION. I have drawn From the selectest fountain of repose A blessed calm;âwhen I lay down to rest I fear'd lest bright remembrances of childhood Should with untimely visitation mock me; But I have slept a deep and dreamless slumber, And rose refresh'd; if sight of thee revives Too thrilling images of joyous life, Yet think not that I blame the love that wakes them. PHOCION. O cherish them, and let them plead with thee To grant my prayer,âthat thou wouldst live for Argos, Not die for her;âthy gracious life shall win More than thy death the favour of the gods, And charm the marble aspect of grim fate Into a blessed change; I, who am vow'd, And who so late was arm'd fate's minister, Implore thee! ION. Speak to me no more of life; There is a dearer name that I would utterâ Thou understand'st meâ Enter Agenor. AGENOR. Thou hast forgot to name Who shall be bidden to this evening's feast? ION. The feast!âmost true; I had forgotten it. Bid whom thou wilt; but let there be large store, If our sad walls contain it, for the wretched Whom hunger palsies. It may be few else Will taste it with a relish. [Exit Agenor. [Ion resumes his address to Phocion, and continues it, broken by the interruptions which follow.] I would speak A word of her who yester-morning rose To her light duties with as blithe a heart As ever yet its equal beating veil'd In moveless alabaster;âplighted now, In liberal hour, to one whose destiny Shall freeze the sources of enjoyment in it, And make it heavy with the life-long pang A widow'd spirit bears!â Enter Cleon. CLEON. The heralds wait To learn the hour at which the solemn games Shall be proclaim'd. ION. The games!âyes, I remember That sorrow's darkest pageantries give place To youth's robustest pastimesâdeath and life Embracing:âat the hour of noon. CLEON. The wrestlers Pray thee to crown the victor. ION. If I live, Their wish shall govern me. [Exit Cleon. Could I recall One hour, and bid thy sister think of me With gentle sorrow as a playmate lost, I should escape the guilt of having stopp'd The pulse of hope in the most innocent soul That ever passion ruffled. Do not talk Of me as I shall seem to thy kind thoughts, But harshly as thou canst, and if thou steal From thy rich store of popular eloquence Some bitter charge against the faith of kings, 'Twill be the gentlest treason. Enter Cassander. CASSANDER. Pardon me, If I entreat thee to permit a few Of thy once cherish'd friends to bid thee joy Of that which swells their pride. ION. They'll madden me.â Dost thou not see me circled round with care? Urge me no more. [As Cassander is going, Ion leaves Phocion and comes to him.] Come back, Cassander! see How peevish greatness makes me. Keep this ringâ It may remind thee of the pleasant hours That we have spent together, ere our fortunes Grew separate: and with thy gracious speech Excuse me to our friends. [Exit Cassander. PHOCION. 'Tis time we seek The temple. ION. Phocion! must I to the temple? PHOCION. There sacrificial rites must be perform'd Before thou art enthroned. ION. Then I must gaze On things which will awake the rebel thoughts I had subduedâperchance may meet with her Whose name I dare not utter. I am ready. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Temple. CLEMANTHE, ABRA. ABRA. Be comforted, dear lady,âhe must come To sacrifice. CLEMANTHE. Recall that churlish word, That stubborn âmust,â that bounds my living hopes, As with an iron circle. He must come! How piteous is affection's state that cleaves To such a wretched prop! I had flown to him Long before this, but that I fear'd my presence Might prove a burthen,âand he sends no word, No token that he thinks of me! Art sure That he must come? The hope has torture in it; Yet it is all my bankrupt heart has left To feed upon. ABRA. I see him now with Phocion Pass through the inner court. CLEMANTHE. He will not come This way, then, to the place of sacrifice. I can endure no more: speed to him, Abra, And bid him, if he holds Clemanthe's life Worthy a minute's loss, to seek me here. ABRA. Dear ladyâ CLEMANTHE. Do not answer me, but run, Or I shall give yon crowd of sycophants To gaze upon my sorrow. [Exit Abra. It is hard, Yet I must strive to bear it, and find solace In that high fortune which has made him strange. He bends this wayâbut slowlyâmournfully. O, he is ill, and I have done him wrong, Forgetting all that he has dared and suffer'd! Enter Ion. ION. What wouldst thou with me, lady? CLEMANTHE. Is it so? Nothing, my lord, save to implore thy pardon, That the departing gleams of a bright dream, From which I scarce had waken'd, made me bold To crave a word with thee;âbut all are fledâ And I have nought to stay thee for. Thy friends Expect thee. ION. 'Twas indeed a goodly dream; But thou art right to think it was no more, And struggle to forget it. CLEMANTHE. To forget it! O no; I cannot struggle to forget What, being past, will be my only future, All I shall live for; do not grudge it me, I will not steal it long. ION. Pray, do not speak In tone so mournful, for thou makest me feel Too sensibly the hapless wretch I am, That troubled the deep quiet of thy soul In that pure fountain which reflected heaven, For a brief taste of rapture. CLEMANTHE. Dost thou yet Esteem it rapture then? My foolish heart, Be still! Yet wherefore should a crown divide us? O, my dear Ion!âlet me call thee so This once at leastâit could not in my thoughts Increase the distance that there was between us When thou, in soul beyond the wealth of kings, Seem'd a poor foundling. ION. It must separate us! Think it no harmless bauble, but a curse Will freeze the current in the veins of youth, And from familiar touch of genial hand, From household pleasures, from sweet daily tasks, From airy thought free wanderer of the heavens, For ever banish me! CLEMANTHE. May not thy state Have some unnoticed shelter mid its folds For love to make its nest in? ION. Not for me; My pomp must be most lonesome, far removed From that sweet fellowship of human kind The slave rejoices in: my solemn robes Shall wrap me as a panoply of ice, And the attendants who may throng around me Shall want the flatteries which may basely warm The sceptral thing they circle. Dark and cold Stretches the path which when I wear the crown I needs must enter:âthe great gods forbid That thou shouldst follow in it! CLEMANTHE. O unkind! And shall we never see each other? Ion. [After a pause.] Yes! I have ask'd that dreadful question of the hills That look eternal; of the flowing streams That lucid flow for ever; of the stars, Amid whose fields of azure my raised spirit Hath trod in glory: all were dumb; but now, While I thus gaze upon thy living face, I feel the love that kindles through its beauty Can never wholly perish:âwe shall meet Again, Clemanthe! CLEMANTHE. Bless thee for that name; Pray, call me so again; thy words sound strangely, Yet they breathe kindness, and I'll drink them in Though they destroy me. Shall we meet indeed? Think not I would intrude upon thy cares, Thy councils, or thy pomps;âto sit at distance, To weave, with the nice labour which preserves The rebel pulses even, from gay threads Faint records of thy deeds, and sometimes catch The falling music of a gracious word, Or the stray sunshine of a smile, will be Comfort enough:âdo not deny me this; Or if stern fate compel thee to deny, Kill me at once! ION. No; thou must live, my fair one: There are a thousand joyous things in life, Which pass unheeded in a life of joy As thine hath been, till breezy sorrow comes To ruffle it; and daily duties paid Hardly at first, at length will bring repose To the sad mind that studies to perform them. Thou dost not mark me. CLEMANTHE. O, I do! I do! ION. If for thy brother's and thy father's sake Thou art content to live, the healer Time Will reconcile thee to the lovely things Of this delightful world,âand if another, A happierâno, I cannot bid thee love Another!âI did think I could have said it, But 'tis in vain. CLEMANTHE. Thou art mine own then still? ION. I am thine own! thus let me clasp thee; nearer; O joy too thrilling and too short! Enter Agenor. AGENOR. My lord, The sacrificial rites await thy presence. ION. I come.âOne more embraceâthe last, the last In this world! Now farewell! [Exit. CLEMANTHE. The last embrace! Then he has cast me off!âno,â'tis not so; Some mournful secret of his fate divides us; I'll struggle to bear that, and snatch a comfort From seeing him uplifted. I will look Upon him in his throne; Minerva's shrine Will shelter me from vulgar gaze; I'll hasten, And feast my sad eyes with his greatness there! [Exit. SCENE III. The Great Square of the Cityâon one side a throne of state prepared,âon the other an altar,âthe statues hung with garlands. Enter Ctesiphon and Cassander. CTESIPHON. Do not vex me by telling me, Cassander, Of his fair speech; I prize it at its worth: Thou'lt see how he will act when seated firm Upon the throne the craven tyrant fill'd, Whose blood he boasts, unless some honest arm Should shed it first. CASSANDER. Hast thou forgot the time When thou thyself delighted to foretell His manhood's glory from his childish virtues? Let me not think thee one of those fond prophets, Who are well pleas'd still to foretell success, So it remain their dream. CTESIPHON. Thou dost forget What has chill'd fancy and delight within meâ [Music at a distance. Hark!âservile trumpets speak his comingâwatch, How power will change him. [They stand aside. The Procession. Enter Medon, Agenor, Phocion, Timocles, Cleon, Sages and People; Ion last, in royal robes. He advances amidst shouts, and speaks. ION. I thank you for your greetingsâShout no more, But in deep silence raise your hearts to Heaven, That it may strengthen one so young and frail As I am, for the business of this hour. Must I sit here? MEDON. Let me, thy earliest friend, Whom thou hast honour'd with the name of father, Conduct thee to thy throne;âand thus fulfil My fondest vision. ION. Thou art still most kindâ MEDON. Nay, do not think of meâmy son! my son! Thou art deadly pale, when thou shouldst share the joy Thou wilt bestow on Argos. ION. Am I pale? It is a solemn officeâyet thus aided, With great Apollo's blessing, I embrace it. [Sits on the throne. Stand forth, Agenor! AGENOR. I await thy will. ION. To thee I look as to the wisest friend Of this afflicted people;âmay I ask thee, Forsaking the dear quiet of thy age, To rule our councils; fill the seats of justice, Too long abused, with men as little frail As men can be who know what frailty is; And order my sad country. AGENOR. Pardon meâ ION. Nay, I will promise thee to ask no more; Thou never yet refused me what I sought In boyish wantonness, and shalt not grudge Thy strength and wisdom to me now. Remember Thou hast all power from me, here or abroad, Alive or dead. AGENOR. Dead! I am old, my Lord. ION. Death is not jealous of thy mild decay, And will not hasten it;âthe sight of youth Inspires its icy finger to be quick, And grasp its prey in noontide. Let me see The captain of the guard. CRYTHES. Thy humblest servant Implores thy favour as the friend of him Whose rightful heir thou art. ION. I cannot thank thee, That wakest the memory of my father's weakness, But I will not forget that thou hast shared The light enjoyments of a noble spirit, And learn'd the need of luxury. I grant For thee and thy brave comrades, ample share Of such rich treasure as the palace holds, To grace thy passage to some distant land, Where, if thy valour seek an honest cause, I wish thee glorious victories; but here We shall not need thee longer. CRYTHES. Dost intend To banish the firm troops before whose valour Barbarian millions tremble, and to leave Our city naked to the first assault Of reckless foes? ION. No, Crythes!âin ourselves, In our own honest hearts and chainless hands Will be our safeguard;âevery freeborn child Shall be prepared to guard his country's peace By well-nerved arm, nor ask for her defence One selfish passion, or one venal sword. I would not grieve thee;âbut thy valiant troop, For I esteem them valiantâmust no more With luxury which suits a desperate camp Infect us. See that this be done, Agenor, Ere night. CRYTHES. My Lordâ ION. No moreâmy word is pass'd. Medon, there is no office I can add To those thou hast grown old in; thou wilt guard The shrine of PhÅbus, and within thy homeâ Thy most delightful homeâbefriend the stranger As thou didst me;âthere thou wilt sometimes think On thy spoil'd inmate. MEDON. Think of thee, my Lord? We shall revere thee in thy glorious reignâ ION. No more of that. Argives! there is a boon I fain would crave of you;âwhen I am dust, Be gentle to the memory of my father, For ye who saw him in his full blown pride Knew little of the inward man, nor guess'd The wrongs which frenzied him; yet not again Let the great interests of the state depend Upon the thousand chances that may sway A piece of human frailty; swear to me That ye will seek hereafter in yourselves The means of sovereignty:âour narrow space, So beautiful, so bounded, so compact, Needs not the magic of a single name Which wider regions may require to draw Their interests into one; but, circled in Like a bless'd family by simple laws, May tenderly be govern'd; all degrees Blent into one harmonious frame may glow A living form of beauty, free to smile In generous peace, or flash with courage bright, If tyranny should threaten. Swear to me That ye will do this! MEDON. Wherefore ask this now?â Thou shalt live long;âthy face, that late so pale Appall'd me, now is flush'd with radiant joy, And speaks a reign of glory. ION. Looks, alas! May prove deceitful. Promise, if I leave No issue, that the sovereign power shall live In the affections of the people's soul, And in our sages' wisdom. MEDON and others. We will swear it! ION. Hear and record the oath, immortal powers! Now give me leave a moment to approach That altar unattended. [He goes to the altar. Gracious gods! In whose mild service my glad youth was spent, Look on me now;âand if there is a Power, As at this solemn time I feel there is, Beyond ye, that hath breathed through all your shapes The spirit of the beautiful that lives In earth and heaven;âto ye I offer up This conscious being, full of life and love For my dear country's welfare. Let this blow End all her sorrows! [Stabs himself, and falls. Ctesiphon rushes to catch him.] Ctesiphon, thou art Avenged, and wilt forgive me. CTESIPHON. Thou hast pluck'd The poor disguise of hatred from my soul, And made me feel how low and base a thing Is vengeance. Could I die to save thee! Clemanthe rushes forward. CLEMANTHE. Hold! Let me support himâstand awayâindeed I have best right, although ye know it not, To cling to him in death. ION. This is a joy I did not hope forâthis is sweet indeed.â Bend thine eyes on me! CLEMANTHE. And for this it was Thou wouldst have weaned me from thee! Couldst thou think I would be so divorced? ION. Thou art right, Clemanthe,â It was a shallow and an idle thought; 'Tis past; we have no show of coldness now, No vain disguise, my girl. Yet thou wilt think On that which, in my feigning, I said trulyâ Wilt thou not, sweet one? CLEMANTHE. I will treasure all. Enter Irus. IRUS. I bring you glorious tidingsâHa! no joy Can enter here. ION. Yesâis it as I hope? IRUS. The pestilence abates. Ion. [Springs to his feet.] Do ye not hear? Why shout ye not?âye are strongâthink not of me; Hearken! the curse my ancestry had spread O'er Argos is dispell'd!âAgenor, give This gentle youth his freedom, who hath brought Sweet tidings that I shall not die in vainâ And Medon! cherish him as thou hast one Who dying blesses thee;âmy own Clemanthe! Let this console theeâArgos lives againâ The offering is acceptedâall is well! [Dies. THE END.</field>
