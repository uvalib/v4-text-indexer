      <field name="fulltext">PANS ANNIVERSARIE; OR, THE SHEPHERDS HOLY-DAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scene ARCADIA. As it was presented at Court before King James. 1625. The Inventors, Inigo Iones. Ben. Iohnson. The first presentation is of three Nymphs strewing severall sorts or flowers, followed by an old Shepherd with a Censer and perfumes. NYMPH I. Thus, thus, begin the yearly rites Are due to PAN on these bright nights; His Morne now riseth, and invites To sports, to dances, and delights: All Envious, and Prophane away, This is the Shepherds Holy-day. NYMPH II. Strew, strew, the glad and smiling ground With every flower, yet not confound The Prime-rose drop, the Springs owne spouse, Bright Dayes-eyes, and the lips of Cowes, The Garden-star, the Queene of May, The Rose, to crowne the Holy-day. NYMPH III. Drop, drop you Violets, change your hues, Now red, now pale, as Lovers use, And in your death goe out as well, As when you liv'd unto the smell: That from your odour all may say, This is the Shepherds Holy-day. SHEPHERD. Well done my pretty ones, raine Roses still, Untill the last be drapt: Then hence: and fill Your fragrant prickles for a second shower, Bring Corn-flag, Tulips, and Adonis flower, Faire Oxe-eye, Goldy-locks, and Columbine, Pinkes, Goulands, King-cups, and sweet Sops-in-wine, Blew Harebells, Pagles, Pansies, Calaminth, Flower-gentle, and the faire-hair'd Hyacinth, Bring rich Carnations, Floure-de-luces, Lillies, The chequ'd, and purple-ringed Daffodillies, Bright Crowne-imperiall, Kings-speare, Holy-hocks, Sweet Venus Navill, and soft Lady-smocks, Bring too, some branches forth of Daphnes haire, And gladdest myrtle for these postes to weare With Spikenard weav'd, and Marjoram betweene, And star'd with yellow-golds, and Meadowes Queene, That when the Altar, as it ought is drest, More odour come not from the PhÃ¦nix nest; The breadth thereof Panchaia may envie, The colours China, and the light the skye. LOUD MUSIQUE. The Scene opens, and in it are the Masquers discover'd sitting about the Fountaine of light. The Musicians attyr'd like the Priests of Pan standing in the worke beneath them, when entreth to the old Shepherd. A Fencer flourishing. Roome for an old Trophie of Time; a Sonne of the sword, a Servant of Mars, the Minion of the Muses, and a Master of Fence. One that hath showne his quarters, and plaid his prizes at all the games of Greece in his time; as Fencing, Wrestling, Leaping, Dauncing, what not? And hath now usher'd hither by the light of my long-sword certaine bold Boyes of BÃ¦otia, who are come to challenge the Arcadians at their owne sports, call them forth on their owne holy-day, and Daunce them down on their owne Greene-swarth. SHEPHERD. 'Tis boldly attempted, and must be a BÃ¦otian enterprise by the face of it, from all the parts of Greece else, especially at this time when the best and bravest spirits of Arcadia, called together by the excellent Arcas, are yonder sitting about the Fountaine of light, in consultation of what honours they may doe the great Pan by encrease of anniversarie rites fitted to the Musique of his peace. FENCER. Peace to thy Pan, and mum to thy Musique, Swaine; There is a Tinker of Thebes a comming, called Epam, with his kettle will make all Arcadia ring of him; What are your sports for the purpose? say, if singing, you shall be sung downe, if dauncing, daunc'd downe. There is no more to be done with you, but know what; which it is; and you are in smoke, gone, vapour'd, vanish'd, blowne, and (as a man would say) in a word of two sillables, Nothing. SHEPHERD. This is short, though not so sweet. Surely the better part of the solemnitie here will be dauncing. FENCER. Enough; They shall be met with instantly in their owne sphere, the sphere of their owne activitie a daunce. But by whom, expect: No CynÃ¦theian, nor Satyres; but (as I said) Boyes of BÃ¦otia; thinges of Thebes, (the Towne is ours, Shepheard) mad merry Greekes, Lads of life, that have no gall in us, but all ayre and sweetnesse. A Tooth-drawer is our Foreman, that if there be but a bitter tooth in the company, it may bee called out at a twitch; he doth command any mans teeth out of his head upon the point of his Poynard; or tickles them forth with his ryding rod: Hee drawes teeth a horse-backe in full speed, yet hee will daunce a foot, he hath given his word: He is yeoman of the mouth to the whole Brotherhood, and is charged to see their gummes bee cleane, and their breath sweet, at a minutes warning. Then comes my learned Theban, the Tinker I told you of, with his kettle Drum (before and after) a Master of Musique, and a man of mettall; He beates the march to the tune of Tickle-foot, Pam, pam, pam, brave Epam with a nondas. That's the straine. SHEPHERD. A high one. FENCER. Which is followed by the trace, and tract of an excellent Juggler, that can juggle with every joynt about him, from head to heele. He can doe tricks with his toes, wind silke, and thred Pearle with them, as nimble a fine fellow of his feet, as his hands: For there is a noble Corne-cutter his companion, hath so pared, and finified themâ. Indeed, he hath taken it into his care, to reforme the feet of all, and fit all their footing to a forme; onely ones play-foot in the company, and he is a Bellowes-mender, allow'd who hath the looking to of all their lungs by patent, and by his place is to set that leg afore still, and with his puffes keepes them in breath during pleasure; A Tinder-box-man to strike new fire into them at every turne, and where he spies any brave sparke that is in danger to goe out, plie him with a match presently. SHEPHERD. A most politique provision. FENCER. Nay, we have made our provisions beyond example, I hope. For to these there is annexed a Clock-keeper, a grave person, as Time himselfe, who is to see that they all keepe time to a nick, and move every elbow in order, every knee in compasse. He is to wind them up, and draw them downe as he sees cause; Then is there a subtile shrewd-bearded Sir, that hath beene a Politician, but is now a maker of Mouse-traps, a great Inginer yet; and he is to catch the Ladyes favours in the Daunce with certaine cringes he is to make; and to baite their benevolence. Nor can wee doubt of the successe, for we have a Prophet amongst us of that peremptorie pate, a Taylour, or master Fashioner, that hath found it out in a painted cloth, or some old hanging (for those are his Librarie) that we must conquer in such a time, and such a halfe time, therefore bids us goe on crosse-leg'd, or however thred the needles of our owne happinesse, goe through-stitch with all, unwind the clew of our cares, he hath taken measure of our mindes, and will fit our fortune to our footing. And to better assure us; at his owne charge, brings his Philosopher with him, a a great Clerke, who (they say) can write, and it is shrewdly suspected but he can read too: And he is to take the whole Daunces from the foot by Brachygraphie, and so make a memoriall, if not a map of the businesse. Come forth lads, and doe your owne turnes. The Antimasque is Daunced. After which FENCER. How like you this Shepheard? was not this geare gotten on a holyday? SHEPHERD. Faith, your folly may deserve pardon, because it hath delighted: But, beware of presuming, or how you offer comparison with persons so neere Deities. Behold where they are, that are now forgiven you, whom should you provoke againe with the like, they will justly punish that with anger, which they now dismisse with contempt, Away. And come you prime Arcadians forth, that taught By Pan the rites of true societie, From his loud Musicke, all your manners wraught And made your Common-wealth a harmonie Commending so to all posteritie. Your innocence from that faire Fount of light As still you sit without the injurie Of any rudenesse, Folly can, or spight: Daunce from the top of the LycÃ¦an mountaine Downe to this valley, and with neerer eye Enjoy, what long in that illumin'd Fountaine You did farre of, but yet with wonder spye. HYMNE I. 1. Of Pan we sing, the best of Singers Pan That taught us swaines, how first to tune our layes, And on the pipe more aires then PhÅbus can. Cho. Heare O you groves, and hills resound his praise. 2. Of Pan we sing, the best of Leaders, Pan That leads the Nayad's, and the Dryad's forth; And to their daunces more then Hermes can. Cho. Heare O you groves, and hills, resound his worth. 3. Of Pan we sing, the best of Hunters, Pan That drives the Heart to seeke unused wayes, And in the chace more then Sylvanus can, Cho. Heare, O you groves, and hills resound his praise. 4. Of Pan we sing, the best of Shepherds, Pan, That keepes our flocks, and us, and both leads forth To better pastures then great Pales can: Cho. Heare O you groves, and hills resound his worth. And while his powers, and praises thus we sing The Valleys let rebound, and all the river's ring. The Masquers descend, and dance their Entrie. HYMNE II. [Chorus.] Pan is our All, by him we breath, wee live, Wee move, we are; 'Tis he our lambes doth reare, Our flocks doth blesse, and from the store doth give The warme and finer fleeces that we weare. He keepes away all heates, and colds, Drives all diseases from our folds: Makes every where the spring to dwell, The Ewes to feed, their udders swell; But if he frowne, the sheepe (alas) The Shepheards wither, and the grasse. Strive, strive, to please him then by still increasing thus The rites are due to him, who doth all right for us. The Maine Daunce. HYMNE III. [Chorus.] If yet, if yet Pans orgies you will further fit, See where the silver-footed Fayes doe sit, The Nymphes of wood and water; Each trees, and Fountaines daughter, Goe take them forth, it will be good To see some wave it like a wood, And others wind it like a flood; In springs, And rings, Till the applause it brings, Wakes Eccho from her seate, The closes to repeate. (Ech. The closes to repeate) Eccho the truest Oracle on ground, Though nothing but a sound. Ech. Though nothing but a sound.) Belov'd of Pan, the Vallyes Queene (Ech. The Valleyes Queene) And often heard, though never seene, (Ech. Though never seene.) REVELLS. Fencer. Roome, roome there: where are you Shepheard? I am come againe with my second part of my bold Bloods, the brave Gamesters: who assure you by me, that they perceive no such wonder in all is done here, but that they dare adventure another tryall. They looke for some sheepish devises here in Arcadia, not these, and therefore a hall, a hall they demand. Shepherd. Nay, then they are past pittie, let them come, and not expect the anger of a Deitie to pursue them, but meet them. They have their punishment with their fact. They shall be sheepe. Fencer. O spare me, by the law of Nations, I am but their Ambassadour. Shepherd. You speake in time Sir. 2. ANTIMASQUE. Shepherd. Now let them returne with their solide heads, and carry their stupiditie into BÅotia, whence they brought it, with an embleme of themselves, and their Countrey. This is too pure an aire for so grosse Braines. End you the rites, and so be eas'd Of these, and then great Pan is pleas'd. HYMNE IIII. [Chorus.] Great Pan the Father of our peace, and pleasure, Who giv'st us all this leasure, Heare what thy hallowd troope of Herdsmen pray For this their Holy-day, And how their vowes to Thee, they in LycÃ¦um pay. So may our Ewes receive the mounting Rammes, And wee bring thee the earliest of our Lambes: So may the first of all our fells be thine, And both the beestning of our Goates, and Kine As thou our folds dost still secure, And keep'st our fountaines sweet and pure Driv'st hence the Wolfe, the Tode, the Brock, Or other vermine from the flock. That wee preserv'd by Thee, and thou observ'd by us May both live safe in shade of thy lov'd MÃ¦nalus. SHEPHERD. Now each returne unto his Charge, And though to day you have liv'd at large, And well your flocks have fed their fill, Yet doe not trust your hirelings still. See, yond they goe, and timely doe The office you have put them to, But if you often give this leave Your sheepe, and you they will deceave. The End.</field>
