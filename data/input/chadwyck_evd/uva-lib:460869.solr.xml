      <field name="fulltext">FAUST: A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. In laying before the British public an English reproduction of such a poem as Faust, the author of this translation is quite aware, that he is venturing upon a very hazardous undertaking. In a work of such depth of feeling, and variety of delineation, the vehement overboiling of youthful enthusiasm, is in as great danger of going beyond the mark, as the correct chasteness of a taste, formed on mere French and Italian models, is of falling within it. A man may be sweet with Petrarch, and brilliant with Voltaire, and yet be very unfit to sympathize with the many-sided nature of Goethe. The consciousness of the difficulty of the task would, long since, have deterred me from attempting it, had not a secret and deep-felt sympathy unconsciously drawn me on, and had I not been encouraged in my first attempts by the favourable opinion of a friend, of whose sincerity I could have as little reason to doubt, as I was perfectly convinced of his fitness to pronounce a judgment on such a subject. I am prefectly aware how very far any thing, that I can produce, must always fall beneath what a translation of Faust ought, according to my ideas, to be. But we might wait long enough before an English Goethe should arise, who would be fitted to do perfect justice to such a work; and, in the mean time, if the present attempt shall but serve to draw public attention, in some degree, to what still remains to be done in the wide domain of German literature, I shall have had my reward. The honesty of my intentions will be a sufficient excuse for their apparent presumption; and whatever the judgment of severe critics may be, I shall still be able to plead, in the language of my poetical master— “So treib's ein jeder wie er kann, Ein kleiner Mann ist auch Ein Mann.” With those who have preceded me in this career, I enter into a friendly rivalry, not an envious competition. That man has very little ground to stand upon, who must first trip up the heels of his neighbour, in order to get a footing; and it sounds more like quackery than true science to trumpet forth the value of one's own productions, by declaiming against the merits of those who have gone before us. It is for these reasons that I have purposely abstained from all mention of former translations, either in the notes, or in the introductory remarks. My own translation was made altogether independently of any of them;—it was to me a re-echoing of a solemn sound, that had long been vibrating in my inmost soul, and become very part and parcel of my intellectual existence. I might, therefore, in all honesty, have subjected my predecessors to a rigid criticism, and exposed what I conceived to be their errors; but would it have been just, would it have been honourable, to do so, while I refrained from all mention of their excellencies, and those useful hints, which he who follows can never fail to receive, either directly or indirectly, from the labours of those who have preceded him? To the public at large, it is my duty to state the principle on which this Translation is formed, and the manner in which it has been executed. The great principle on which the excellence of a poetical translation depends, seems to be, that it should not be a mere transposing, but a recasting, of the original. On this principle, it has been my first and chief endeavour to make my Translation spirited —to seize, if possible, the very soul and living power of the German, rather than to give a careful and anxious transcription of every individual line, or every minute expression. A poetical translator must, to a certain extent, aspire to the honour of original composition. He must stand on his own feet, and flap his own wings, else will his motions never fail to be stiff and artificial, and give any thing but a true idea of the living spring of the original; with this proviso, however, that, though each motion be his own, it preserve spontaneously a complete sympathy and harmony with each motion of the author, whose work he endeavours to reproduce. A man may make a stuffed bird the same in every feather, in every tint, as the natural bird from which it is copied; but the question always comes to be, Is it alive? I make these remarks by the way of protest against those petty verbal criticasters, who seem to think that a translation is made for no other purpose than to enable them to bring to light their linguistical lore, in pointing out how each individual word of the original differs from each individual word of the translation. I hope, however, that the critics of philosophy and of feeling will not find my Translation wanting even in that minute accuracy which the reverence due to such a genius as Goethe demands. At least, I am conscious to myself of having wrestled with an honest persevering striving, to give, as far as possible, an exact transcript of the expression, style, and measure, as well as of the spirit of the original. Indeed these two things are so intimately connected, that, like soul and body, they cannot be separated; only we must beware of falling into poetical materialism, by making the spirit bend to the form, instead of allowing the matter to be kneaded and moulded into shape, by the plastic power of the indwelling spirit. With regard to the versification, I am afraid many of my readers may be inclined to say of it, as the Edinburgh Reviewer said of Sir Walter Scott's Lay, that it is “in the highest degree irregular and capricious.” So far as concerns the measure of the original, I can say, with the whole of Germany, that it is in the highest degree beautiful and harmonious, and must appear so to every one, whose musical perception has not been lulled asleep by the sing-song of the Popian couplet. Measure is the flexible clothing, not the clogging fetter, of the poet's song,—it waves and folds itself in sympathetic obedience to every motion of his inward man; and, as he is no orator who makes as little distinction in the intonation of the different parts of an oration, as a child does when repeating his catechism, so he understands but poorly the nature of verse, who does not know that every feeling and passion, every swelling and falling of every feeling, has as necessarily its own peculiar and only proper measure, as every sentence has its peculiar intonation. But after the examples which Scott and Southey, Wordsworth and Coleridge, have set before us in this regard, I think it unnecessary to detain the reader with any lengthened apology for the peculiar versification of Goethe's Faust. I need only state, that I have, except in a very few cases, faithfully followed the measure of the original; and, in so far as it is possible in a Translation, endeavoured to echo back the tones of the Goethian harp. This, however, is the most trying point of all; and I beg of the English reader, if he finds the Poem unharmonious, to lay all the blame on him, to whom alone it belongs, and who is, at the same time, most willing to bear it. One thing I must mention to avoid misconception. I have frequently, in imitation of the original, introduced Alexandrines in situations, where, to the English ear, they appear altogether uncalled for. I am of opinion, however, that these long lines have a peculiar beauty in giving a slow and easy undulation to the verse, and varying the monotony of the ten-syllabled lines. They are, accordingly, seldom introduced by our Poet without cause; and wherever they are manifestly intended to produce the impression of slowness and ease, I have been most scrupulous in retaining them. Thus, for instance, in p. 34, the long line of my Translation, “And see how down the stream the gay ships softly glide,” is an exact imitation of the original: “Und sieht den Fluss hinab die bunten Schiffe gleiten.” And who is there so deaf to harmony, that does not perceive instinctively the beauty of this versification? The two lines spoken into Mephistopheles' ear, by the old hag of the kitchen (p. 108) are long on the same principle; and, though not always so distinctly expressible, there is always an instinctive mental harmony, that regulates the length of the lines in Goethe's versification. Even when tortured through the crucible of a translation, Goethe's measure still retains a great portion of its wondrous music; and I shall be much disappointed, indeed, if I have not been able to convey some faint idea, even of this peculiar beauty, to the English ear. With regard to the mere mechanics of this Translation, I have rhymed, because the original rhymes; and because I cannot see how rhyme can be separated from the aesthetical form of the poem. The difficulties, which this peculiar mode of translation is supposed to present, exist more in the indolence of the Translator, than in the nature of the thing; and a man who is in love with his work, will not be deterred by a mere mechanical impediment, which a little perseverance, and a little dexterity, will, in a short time, altogether remove. Some rhymeless lines the reader will find, here and there; for this procedure I had peculiar reasons, known only to him who has experienced the difficulty of producing a translation, at once accurate, easy, and spirited. A strong desire to give as close a transcript as possible of the original, has also induced me, on one or two occasions, to admit rhymes, which would have been altogether inexcusable in the freedom of original composition; but these impure rhymes will, I hope, be found to be comparatively few, in proportion to the length of the poem; and the reader may be assured that they never occur, except from perhaps an over-anxious striving to keep as nearly as possible to the German text. To attempt to imitate the double endings, whereever they occur in the original, would shew a great misconception of the capabilities of the two languages. Lord Leveson Gower, whose powers of English versification are, on many occasions, so favourably exhibited in his translation of Faust, would, in my opinion, have given a much better version, both of the prologue-hymn, and of the dedication, had he not imposed upon himself the necessity of repeating the alternate trochaic rhymes of the original. Even Shelley's exquisite translation of the above hymn, has, I think, suffered somewhat from the same cause; and, warned by these two examples, and in order to give as literal a transcript as possible of this beautiful piece of composition, I have retained the trochaic ending of the first and third lines in these stanzas, but only rhymed the second and fourth. Having thus rendered an account of my stewardship, I leave Goethe and myself, with all good cheer, in the hands of a discriminating public. Let me not, however, close these remarks, without returning publicly my thanks to those learned and talented gentlemen, who have assisted me with their advice and encouragement in the prosecution of this work. I am under especial obligations to Sir William Hamilton, Bart., Professor Wilson, and George Moir, Esq. Advocate, who have either revised my manuscript, corrected my proofs, or furnished me with assistance in collecting the Notes, which to such a poem as Faust were indispensable: nor should I forget to mention the names of Mr Repp and Dr Nachot, whom I have consulted as to the meaning of some German phrases, in regard to which I was doubtful; —and last, not least, be my thanks paid to Mr D. Haig, Librarian of the Advocates' Library, who gave me every facility in bringing to the light of day those musty old tomes on the black art, of which I have made so copious use in my notes. J. S. B. Edinburgh, February 1834.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRANSLATOR'S DEDICATION. AN GOETHE. Versuch ich's, mich so kühnlich hoch zu heben, Zu den Gefilden reiner Lebensstrahlen? Und wag' ich's frech, mit schwacher Hand zu malen, Was Dir nur ziemt, das buntbewegte Leben? Wie soll der Kinderzunge lallend Streben Aussprechen, was des Mannes Kraft gesungen? Wie soll des Menschen Stimme wiedergeben, Was aus der tiefen Götterbrust entsprungen? O! wenn der Liebe ungestümer Drang Mich trieb, dass ich das Heiligste entweihe, Und zu berauschter, frecher Sünde zwang; So schaue Du, aus der Verklärten Reihe, Aus Himmelsharfen liebevollem Klang, Uud wenn du mich nicht loben kannst, verzeihe!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION PREFIXED TO THE LATER EDITIONS OF FAUST. Ye hover nigh, uncertain shapes, again, That erst the misty eye of Fancy drew! Shall I at length your shadowy flight detain, And the fond dreaming of my youth pursue? Ye press around!—resume your ancient reign, As from the past's dim haze ye rise to view, The magic breath that wafteth on your train Stirs in my breast long-silent chords again. Ye raise the images of happy days, And many a dear-loved shade ye bring to view; The echo like of half-forgotten lays, First love and early friendship ye renew; The pang returns, life's labyrinthine maze Again the plaint of sorrow wanders through, And names the loved ones, who, by Fortune reft Of fairest hours, the world and me have left. They hear no more the sequel of my song, The souls to whom I sung my early lay; Dispersed for ever is the friendly throng, The echo of my lyre has died away. My sorrow floats a careless crowd among, Whose praise hath ceased my listless heart to sway, And they who once were merry with my mirth, If yet they live, are scattered o'er the earth. And I recall, with long-unfelt desire, That realm of spirits, silent and serene! My lisping lay, like the Æolian lyre, Gives wavering tones, with many a pause between; My heart is moved with youth's returning fire, Tear follows tear where long no tear hath been; I see the present as a distant goal, The past, revived, is present to my soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRELUDE ON THE STAGE. Manager of a Strolling Company. Stage-Poet. Merryfellow. MANAGER. Ye twain, in weal and woe to me Who have been faithful company, Say, have ye heard yet what effect is making In German lands our hopeful undertaking? Without the multitude we cannot thrive, Their maxim is, to live and to let live. The posts are up, the planks are fastened all, And every one expects a festival. With arch'd eye-brows already sit they there, And gape for something new to make them stare. I know how to conciliate the mob, But ne'er yet felt it such a ticklish job: 'Tis true, what they have read is not the best, But that they much have read must be confessed. How shall we make our pieces fresh and new, And, with some meaning in them, pleasing too? In sooth, I like to see the people pouring Into our booth, like storm and tempest roaring, When, as the waving impulse onward heaves them, The narrow gate of grace at length receives them. When, long ere it be dark, with lusty knocks, They fight their way on to the money-box, And, like a starving crowd around a baker's door. For tickets, as for bread, they roar. So wonder-working is the poet's sway O'er every heart,—so let it work to-day! POET. O mention not that motley crowd to me, Which, only seen, makes frighted genius flee: Hide from my view that wild tumultuous throng, Whose whirlpool drags us forcibly along! No! lead me to some heavenly still retreat, Where blooms pure joy, such as for bards is meet: Where love and friendship, with their sweet control, Create and cherish blessings for the soul. Alas! what there from the deep bosom sprung, What scarce was lisp'd out by the feeble tongue, What now and then succeeds, but oftener not, Is swallowed by the moment, and forgot. Full oft it toils through many a patient year, Till in its finished beauty it appear. Vain glittering show may snatch a fleeting fame, But genuine worth Posterity shall claim. MERRYFELLOW. With sons and grandsons we have nought to do, Look to the world that lives and moves with you; And if the future be the present's heir, 'Tis meet the living first should have their share. Methinks, the present of a goodly boy Has something that the wisest might enjoy. Whoso with easy sweetness can discourse, May tame the humours of the mob by force; He courts a crowd, the surer to control By strength of art the sympathetic whole. Quit ye like men, be honest bards and true, Let Fancy, with her many-sounding chorus, Reason, sense, feeling, passion, move before us; But, mark you well! a spice of folly, too. MANAGER. Give what you please, so that you give but plenty. They come to see, you must engage their eyes; Scene upon scene, each act may have its twenty, To keep them gaping still in new surprise. This is the royal road to public favour, You snatch it thus, and it is yours for ever. The mass can be compelled by mass alone, Each one at length seeks out what is his own. Bring much, and every one is sure to find, From out your nosegay, something to his mind. You give a piece—give it at once in pieces, Such a ragout each taste and temper pleases, And is as easy to the bard's invention, As from the players it needs small attention. In vain into an artful whole you glue it, The public, in the long run, will undo it. POET. Ye do not feel how vile such petty craft must be! How far beneath the artist's dignity. You, too, it seems, can condescend to praise The bungling maxims of these modern days. MANAGER. I do not fear such an objection; Whoso would work with circumspection Must use the tools that are most fit. Consider what soft wood you have to split, And for what sort of audience you write! One comes to kill a few hours o'the night; Another, with his drowsy wits oppressed, An over-sated banquet to digest; And not a few—whom least of all we choose— Come to the play from reading the reviews. They come to us as to a masquerade, And curiosity wings every pace; The ladies shew themselves, and shew their dress, And play their parts, although they are not paid. What dream you of, on your poetic height? A crowded house, forsooth, gives you delight! Look at your patrons, as you should, You'll find them one-half cold, and one-half rude. One leaves the play, to spend the night Upon a damsel's breast in wild delight; Another o'er a billiard table frets, And play and players both alike forgets. For such an audience, and for purpose such, Why should ye plague the gentle Muses much? I tell you, give them more, and always always more, 'Tis the sole precept of dramatic lore; And since with quality to please is vain, With quantity confound them if you can— But what's the matter?—ravishment or pain? POET. If such your service, I am not the man! Shall then the poet make his birthright vain? The right of man, that Nature's gift imparts, To please the many, reckless jest away? What gives him power to move all hearts? Each stubborn element to sway? What but the harmony, his being's inmost tone, That sucks all feelings back into his own? When listless Nature her eternal thread Th'unwilling spindle twists around, When hearts to hearts, in life's confus'd parade, With jarring dissonance resound; Who guides with living power the measur'd row, That with well-balanced impulse it may flow? Who consecrates each motion of the soul, To beat in glorious concert with the whole? Who makes the storm of youthful passions rage, And glow the evening-red of thoughtful age? Who scatters Spring's most lovely blooms upon The path of the beloved one? Who plaits the leaves, that unregarded grow, Into a crown, to deck the honour'd brow? Who charms the gods? Who makes Olympus yield? The power of man in poet's art reveal'd. MERRYFELLOW. Then learn such noble powers to wield, And on the poet's business enter As one does on a love adventure. First let them meet by chance, then feel, and then remain, Till, net-caught by degrees, they find retreat is vain; Their fortune seems to rise, anon it sinks again, Deep anguish follows on enjoyment's trance, And, e'er they are aware, it turns out a romance. A play like this will please, I warrant you! Portray the fulness of the living man, The life that each one lives, though it be known to few; A faithful likeness pleases every one. Strange motley pictures in a misty mirror, A spark of truth within a cloud of error; 'Tis thus we brew the genuine beverage, To edify and to refresh the age. The bloom of youth, in eager expectation, With gaping ears, draws in your revelation; Each tender sentimental disposition Sucks from your work sweet woe-begone nutrition; All see their inmost soul reveal'd by thee, And yield them to the power of wondrous sympathy. As yet they weep and laugh, and ask not why, Their spirits freely soar, the show of things gives pleasure; The finish'd man applies the critic's measure, Where growing minds content them to enjoy. POET. Then give me back the time again, When mine own spirit, too, was growing, When my whole being was a fount Of thronging songs within me flowing! When mist the world around me veil'd, Each bud embryo-wonders cherish'd, And I the thousand flow'rets broke That on each meadow richly flourish'd! Though I had nothing, yet I had a treasure, The thirst for truth, and in delusion pleasure. Give me the free unshackled impulse, The height of joy, the depth of pain, The might of love, the strength of hatred, O give me back my youth again! MERRYFELLOW. The fire of youth, good friend, you need, of course, Into the hostile ranks to break, Or when the loveliest damsels hang by force, With amorous clinging, from your neck, When the fleet runner's destin'd wreath From the far distant goal is winking, And when the hurried dance you leave, To spend a noisy night in drinking. But to awake the well-known lyre, With graceful touch, that tempers fire, And to a self-appointed goal, With pleasant rambling, on to roll, Such, aged sirs, your easy duties are, But not the less for this we honour you; That old age makes us children is not true, It only finds us children as we were. MANAGER. With words a man of business little speeds, 'Tis time, methinks, that we should come to deeds; While compliments are interchanged, Half the affair had been arranged. What nonsense prate ye about humour? A lazy man is never in the humour. If once your names are on the poet's roll, The Muses must be under your control. You know already what we need; Strong liquors need we for the brain, Brew at them with unwearied speed! What is not done to-day, to-morrow hopes in vain; You should not lose a single day, But let the present purpose lay Hold of your fleeting fancies by the cue; Once caught they are not apt to run away, Till they have done what they were meant to do. Among the sons of German play, Each tries his hand at what he may; Therefore be brilliant in your scenery, And spare no cost on your machinery. Let sun and moon be at your call, And scatter stars on stars around; Let water, fire, and rocky-wall, And bird, and beast, and fish, abound. Thus in your narrow booth mete forth The compass of Creation's girth; And wing your progress, ponder'd well, From heav'n to earth, from earth to hell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Night. Faust discovered sitting unsettled at his desk, in a high-vaulted narrow gothic chamber. FAUST. Here, 'mid these books, for many a year I've travelled science' mazy sphere, Law, Medicine, and Philosophy, And thee, alas! Theology, With study most severe. Here stand I now, with all my lore, No wiser than I was before; Master yclept and Doctor too, I do as other pedants do, And up and down, and to and fro, Lead by the nose my scholars slow— And see how vain is all our lore! Which burns me to the very core. True I am wiser than Wittenberg's hall Can boast with her doctors, priests, parsons, and all; No scruples nor doubts in my bosom dwell, Nor idle fears of devils in hell,— But for my wisdom, every joy That sateth others, me doth cloy. Nor vainly deem I to understand What passes the grasp of mortal hand, Nor, with delusive boast, pretend The manners of the age to mend. Nor money nor estate have I, Nor pomp of life and dignity. Such case no dog might longer live in! Therefore to magic I have given My mind, from spirit's mouth to draw Truths passing Nature's vulgar law; That I, with bitter-sweating brow, No more may teach what I do not know; That I with piercing ken may see The world's in-dwelling energy, The hidden seeds of life explore, And deal in words and forms no more. Oh! shon'st thou now, thou full Moon bright. For the last time my woes upon, Thou, whom so many a sad midnight Beside this desk I've watched alone; Then over books and paper shone On me thy soft and friendly light! Oh! that beneath thy lovely ray, On peaky summit I might stray, Round mountain caves with spirits hover, And flit the shadowy meadows over, From all the qualms of knowledge free, Bathe me to health within thy dewy sea! In vain! still pines my prisoned soul Within this curst dank dungeon hole! Where dimly finds ev'n heaven's blest ray, Through painted glass, its broken way. Shut in by heaps of books up-piled, All worm-begnawed, and dust-besoiled, And to the ceiling from the ground, With old smok'd papers hung around; All circled round with chemick glasses, Crammed full of instruments and cases, And old ancestral furniture— This is thy world! such den must Faustus' soul immure! And ask I still why thrills my heart, With timid beatings, and oppressed? And why some secret unknown smart Chills every life-pulse in my breast? 'Stead of the living sphere of Nature, Where man was placed by his Creator, Surrounds thee mouldering dust alone, The grinning skull and skeleton! Arise! forth to the fields, arise! And this mysterious magic page, From Nostradamus' hand so sage, May it not for a guide suffice? Then dost thou see the secret tether That binds the planet-orbs together, And taught by Nature's mightiest spells, Thy innate force of soul upwells, As speaks one spirit to another. In vain that study dull and slow, These sacred signs would seek to know. Ye unseen powers that hover near me, Answer, I conjure, when ye hear me! (He opens the book, and sees the sign of the Macrocosm.) Ha! what ecstatic joy this page reveals, At once through all my opening senses flowing! Young holy zest of life my spirit feels, In every nerve, in every vein, new glowing! Was it a God whose hand these signs portray'd? That charm the tempest of my soul to rest, That fill with joy my troubled breast, And, with mysterious impulse, spread The powers of Nature bare to mortal sight. Am I a God? so wondrous is the light Within me! in these lines so pure, I see Wide-working Nature's hidden energy. Now may I know the sage's words aright; “The world of spirits is not all concealed, Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead! Up, scholars, bathe your earthly hearts congeal'd, In the warm dew of morning's freshening red!” (He looks at the sign.) How mingles here in one the soul with soul, And lives each portion in the restless whole! How heavenly powers, a bright unwearied band, Their golden flaggons reach from hand to hand, And bliss-exhaling swing from pole to pole! From the high welkin to earth's centre bounding, Harmonious all through the great All resounding! What wondrous show! alas, 'tis but a show! Where grasp I thee, unbounded Nature, where? And you, ye teeming breasts? ye founts, whence flow All living influences fresh and fair, Whereon the heavens and earth dependent hang, Where seeks relief the withered bosom's pang,— Your founts still well, and must I pine in vain? (He turns the book over impatiently, and beholds the sign of the Spirit of the Earth.) What different working on me hath this sign! Thou, Spirit of the Earth, art to me nearer; Already sees my strengthened spirit clearer, And glows my frame as I had drunk new wine. New strength I feel into the world to dash, The woes to bear, and share the joys of life, Its storms defy, and battle with its strife, Unmoved ev'n in the shipwreck's hopeless crash! Clouds hover o'er me— The moon is dim! The lamp's flame wanes— It smokes!—Red beams dart forth Around my head—a shuddering cold Comes wafted from the vaulted roof, And seizes on me! I feel't thou hover'st near me, conjured spirit, Reveal thee! Ha! how swells with wild delight My bursting heart! And feelings, strange and new, At once through all my raptured senses dart! I feel my inmost soul to thee surrendered! Thou must! thou must! and were my life to pay for't! (He seizes the book, and pronounces with a mysterious air the sign of the Spirit. A red flame darts forth, and the Spirit appears in the flame.) SPIRIT. Who calls me? FAUST. (turning away.) Vision of affright! SPIRIT. Thou hast with mighty spells invoked me, And to obey thy call provoked me, And now— FAUST. Hence from my sight! SPIRIT. Thy panting prayer besought my form to view, To hear my voice, and know my semblance too; Now bending from my lofty sphere to please thee, Here am I!—ha! what shuddering terrors seize thee, And overpower thee quite! where now is gone The soul's proud call? the breast that scorned to own Earth's thrall, a world in itself created, And bore and cherished? with its fellow sated That swell'd with throbbing joy to leave its sphere And vie with spirits, their exalted peer. Where art thou, Faust? whose invocation rung Upon mine ear, whose powers all round me clung? Art thou that Faust? whom melts my breath away, Trembling ev'n to the life-depths of thy frame, Now shrunk into a piteous worm of clay! FAUST. Shall I then yield to thee, thou thing of flame? I am thy peer, am Faust, am still the same! SPIRIT. Where life's floods flow, And its tempests rave, Up and down I wave, Flit I to and fro; Birth and the grave, Life's secret glow, A changing motion, A boundless ocean, Whose waters heave Eternally; Thus on the noisy loom of Time I weave The living mantle of the Deity. FAUST. Thou who round the wide world wendest, Thou busy sprite, how near I feel to thee! SPIRIT. Thou'rt like the spirit whom thou comprehendest, Not me! (vanishes.) FAUST. (astounded.) Not thee! Whom, then? I, image of the Godhead, Not like thee! (knocking is heard.) Oh death!—'tis Wagner's knock—he comes to break The charm that bound me while the Spirit spake! Thus my supremest bliss ends in delusion Marr'd by a sneaking pedant-slave's intrusion! SCENE II. Enter Wagner in night-gown and night-cap—a lamp in his hand. Faust turns impatiently towards him. WAGNER. Excuse me, sir, I heard your voice declaiming, Belike some old Greek drama, and I came in To profit by your learned recitation. For in these days the art of declamation Is held in highest estimation; And I have heard asserted that a preacher, Might boast to have an actor for his teacher. FAUST. Yes, when our parsons preach to make grimaces, As in these times a no uncommon case is. WAGNER. Alas! when a poor wight is so confined Amid his books, shut up from all mankind, And sees the world scarce on a holiday, As through a telescope, and far away, How may he hope, with oratorial skill, To bend the minds he knows not to his will? FAUST. What is not felt, no force of art may gain; True eloquence must from the full heart pour, And with an innate, sweet persuasive power, The hearts of all that hear enchain. Go to! still sit, together still to glue Your petty piecework, dressing your ragout From others' feasts, your piteous flames still blowing, From sparks beneath dull heaps of ashes glowing! Vain wonderment of children and of apes, If with such paltry meed content thou art; The pliant heart to heal he only shapes, Whose words persuasive flow from heart to heart. WAGNER. But the delivery is, sir, as you know, A chief thing, and, alas! here I have much to do. FAUST. Be thine to seek the honest gain! No, shallow-sounding fool! Sound sense finds utterance for itself, Without the critic's rule; And if in earnest ye intend to speak, What need for words with curious care to seek? Your speeches, which so primly ye compose, With which ye crisp the shavings of mankind, Are unrefreshing as the foggy wind That through the sapless leaves in autumn blows! WAGNER. Alas! our life is short, but long the road That to the goal of wisdom must be trod; The thought at times damps all my studies' ardour, And head and heart alike despair. Ere we may reach the sources, what is harder Than all the means to know that help us there? And when scarce half the way behind us lies, The poor fagged devil, will he nill he, dies. FAUST. The musty parchment, deem'st thou then to be The well, from which one draught may slake the thirst for ever? The quickening power of science find'st thou never Until from thine own soul it gushes free. WAGNER. And yet it seems most useful to compare The times that once were with the times that are; To see how wise men thought in Greek and Roman ages, And know how wondrous far advanced our modern age is. FAUST. O yes! ev'n to the stars, I trow, so far! My friend, the ages that are past Are as a book with seven seals made fast; And what you call the spirit of the times, At bottom but the spirit is of those Whose mind is made the mirror of the times, And the reflection of themselves back throws. And then, in sooth, 'tis oft a woeful case, To see how they confuse, distort, deface! A heap of rubbish, and a lumber room, At best a paltry masquerade theatrical, With sundry learned maxims clept pragmatical, Such as from puppet-mouths do fitly come! WAGNER. But, then, the world!—the human heart and mind! Something of this to know are all inclined. FAUST. Yes, as such knowledge generally goes! Who dares to call the child by its right name? The noble few, that to true knowledge came, Were fools enough their hearts to all to shew, And let the vulgar throng their wisdom know; And therefore were they burned and crucified. I do beseech thee friend, 'tis late i'the night, For this time be our converse laid aside. WAGNER. So learnedly, 'twere my supreme delight To speak with Doctor Faust till morning-tide; But on the morrow, being Easter, I Your patience, with some questions more, may try. Though with much zeal I've studied various lore, My knowledge-thirsting soul still craveth more. (Exit.) SCENE III. Faust, alone. FAUST. Strange how his pate alone Hope never leaves, Who still to shallow husks of learning cleaves! With greedy hand, who digs for hidden treasure, And, when he finds a grub, rejoiceth above measure! Durst such a voice of mortal man resound Where compassed me the spirit-world around? Yet for this time, my thanks to thee, Thou meanest of earth's progeny! From desperation's might thou hast reliev'd me, That of my senses had well nigh bereav'd me. Alas! so giant-great the vision came, That I might feel me dwarf, ev'n as I am. I, God's own image that already deemed Me near, where Truth's eternal mirror gleamed, And, casting this vile skin of mortal clay, Enjoyed myself, in bright celestial day; I, more than with a cherub's glory crown'd, That almost seem'd through Nature's veins to flow, And with creative power the life to know Of gods—how is my heart's pride now laid low! One word of thunder struck me to the ground. In vain! in vain! I strive to reach the sphere Of spirit-natures; though I have the power To make them at my mighty spell appear, Yet to enforce their stay I have no power. My raptur'd soul, in that blest moment's trance, I felt so little and so great at once; But frowningly thou drov'st me then Back to the uncertain lot of men. Where find I aid? what shun, and what pursue? Shall I that impulse of my soul obey? Alas! not sufferings only, but our actions too, Are clogs and bars in the free spirit's way! To the pure essence of the human mind Still foreign matter from without is joined; Soon as the good things of this world we gain, We deem the better part illusion vain; And noblest feelings, connate with our birth, Are chilled in the wild tumult of the earth. Young fancy, that once soared, with flight sublime, On wings of hope, ev'n to th'Eternal's throne, Is now content a little space to own, When in the mighty whirlpool-stream of time Our scanty pleasures perish one by one. Care nestles soon in every heart, And, nourishing the secret smart, There rocks her to and fro, and peace and joy are gone. What though new tempting shapes she still employ, Estate, mayhap, or house with its annoy, As wife and child appear she, water, flame, Dagger or poison, she is still the same; And still we fear for that which happens never, And what we lose not are bewailing ever. Alas! alas! too deep 'tis felt! too deep! With gods may vie no son of mortal clay; More am I like to slimy worms that creep And dig, and dig, through earth their murky way, Which, while they crawl, and feed upon the dust, By passing wanderer's tread to death are crushed! Is it not dust, what this old gothic wall From all its musty benches shews me? And dust the trifling trumperies all That in this world of moths enclose me? Here is it that I hope to find Wherewith to sate my craving mind? Need I peruse page upon page, To know that men, in every age, Tormented have themselves in vain, With fruitless labour of the brain, And here and there, with centuries between, One happy man belike hath been? What would thy grinning say, if thou could'st speak, Thou hollow skull, save that thy brain, like mine, The light of day once wretchedly did seek, Through heavy glimmerings of the twilight-shine? Ye instruments, in sooth, now laugh at me, With wheel and cog-wheel, ring, and cylinder; At Nature's door, ye should have been the key, But though your ward be good, the bolt ye cannot stir. Mysterious Nature may not choose That man should draw her sacred veil aside, And what she from the spirit's eye doth hide, In vain thou seek'st to force with levers and with screws. Thou antique furniture, why keep I thee, Save that thou camest from my sire to me? Thou parchment-scroll, thou hast been smok'd upon Long as around this desk the sorry lamp-light shone; Much better had I spent my little gear, Than with this little burdened here to sweat! Why of my father's substance am I heir But for my pleasure to dispose of it? That which we do not use, a heavy burden lies; We use it best as the fleet moment flies. But wherefore does that flask a magnet prove To draw to that one spot my fixed eyes? And why does sudden light within me rise As the moon gleams through the dark midnight grove? I greet thee, matchless phial! thee no more Shall musty shelves, a useless lumber, keep; I take thee down, with a devotion deep, And in thy potent juice do I adore The height of human wit, and human skill. Thou essence of the opiate dew of sleep, Thou extract of all subtle powers that kill, Be mine the first fruits of thy strength to reap! I look on thee, and soothed is my heart's pain; I grasp thee, straight is lulled my racking brain, And wave by wave my soul's flood ebbs away. I see the ocean wide before me rise, And at my feet her sparkling mirror lies; To brighter shores invites a brighter day. A car of fire is hovering o'er my head, Descending lightly! let me mount on high, Through ether let my winged steps be sped Unto new spheres of pure activity. Such life of gods, such heavenly ecstasy, May'st thou, so late a worm, hope to receive? Yes! let but my unflinching purpose be This earth, and the blest light of day to leave, And open break the portals, which by most With fear, that fain would pass them by, are crost. This is the time by deeds, not words, to prove That earth-born man yields not to gods above. Before that gloomy cavern not to tremble, Where all those spectral shapes of dread assemble, Which Fancy, slave of every childish fear, Bids, to be torment of herself, appear, Forwards to strive unto that passage dire, Whose narrow mouth seems fenced with hell's collected fire; Such fearless step to take with glad resolve, Ev'n though the soul to nothing should dissolve. Now come thou down! thou crystal goblet clear, From out thy venerable case, Where thou hast lain unused for many a year. In days of yore, right gaily didst thou grace The merry banquets of my sires, When circled round in thee the draught that glee inspires. Thy goodly round, the figures pictured there So quaint, the drinker's duty to declare In ready rhyme what meaning they might bear, And at one draught to empty out the cup, Bring to my memory many a youthful night. Now to no comrade shall I yield thee up, Nor whet my wit upon thy pictures bright; Here is a juice that drunken makes the soul For ever. With brown flood it fills the bowl. Let this last draught, the draught of mine own choice, With cheerful heart be quaffed, and cheerful voice A solemn greeting to the rising morn! (He brings the cup to his lips.) A sound of bells is heard, and distant quire-singing. QUIRE OF ANGELS. Christ is arisen! Joy be to mortal man, Whom, since the world began, Evils inherited, By his sins merited, Through his veins creeping, Sin-bound are keeping. FAUST. What murmurs deep, what notes, so clear and pure, Draw from my lips the glass by force away? Thus early do the bells their homage pay, Of hollow music, to new Easter day! Already sing the quires the soothing song That erst, round the dark grave, an angel throng Sung, to proclaim the great salvation sure! QUIRE OF WOMEN. With clothes of fine linen All cleanly we swathed him; With spices and balsams All sweetly we bathed him; In the tomb of the rock, where His body was lain, We come and we seek him, But seek all in vain! QUIRE OF ANGELS. Christ is arisen! Praised be his name! His love shared our prison Of sin and of shame. He has borne the hard trial Of self-denial, And, victorious, ascends to the skies whence he came! FAUST. What seek ye here, ye gently powerful tones, Sweet seraph-music mid a mortal's groans? Such sounds may minds of weaker mould relieve, I hear the message, but cannot believe; For Faith's first-born, and best-loved child is still, And still will be, a miracle. To those bright spheres I may not dare to strive From which the holy message doth resound; Yet, fraught with memory of my youth, this sound Hath power to warn from death, and bid me live. A time there was when Heaven's very kiss, On solemn Sabbath, seemed to fall on me, When spoke the minster-bell devotion's bliss, And prayer to God was burning ecstasy. A holy dim unknown desire Drove me, o'er hill and dale, away from men, And, mid a thousand tears of fire, I felt a world arise within me then. This song proclaimed the sports of youth so gay, And merry-makings when the spring began; Now Memory holds my soul with potent sway, And thoughts of childhood rule the full-grown man. Oh! sound thou on, thou sweet celestial strain, The tear doth gush, Earth claims her truant son again! QUIRE OF THE DISCIPLES. By death of sorrow, though Laid in the lowly grave, Soars he sublimely now Whence he us came to save. Proudly exalted He, Bliss of his Father near; On the earth's bosom we, Burden'd are waiting here: Comfortless left are we, Toiling through earth's annoy, Weeping to envy thee, Master, thy joy! QUIRE OF ANGELS. Christ is arisen From the corrupting clay Break ye your fetters, Joyful, away! Praising, by deeds of love, Him who now reigns above, Feeding the brethren poor, Preaching salvation sure, Joys that shall aye endure, Boldly withouten fear, For He is near. END OF ACT FIRST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Before the gate of the town. Motley groups of people are crowding out to walk. SOME JOURNEYMEN. Brethren, whither bound? OTHERS. To the Jägerhaus we go. THE FIRST. But our way leads us to the mill. A JOURNEYMAN. At Wasserhof best cheer is to be found. A SECOND. But then the road is not agreeable. THE OTHERS. And what dost thou? A THIRD. I do as others do. A FOURTH. To Burgdorf let us go, there are we sure to find The best of beer, and maidens to our mind, And frolics too, if we be so inclined. A FIFTH. You over-wanton fellow, does your skin For the third time to itch begin? I shudder at the place,—to it A single step I will not budge. A SERVANT GIRL. No! No! back to the town I'd rather trudge. ANOTHER. Beneath yon poplar trees he's sure to sit. THE FIRST. No mighty matter that for me, Since he will go with none but thee, And in the dance he's always thine: What have thy joys to do with mine? THE OTHER. To-day he will not be alone—he said That he would bring with him the curly-head. STUDENT. Donner and blitz! how the stout wenches stride! Come, brother, come! we must be at their side. A good strong beer, a girl that's smartly dress'd, And biting sharp tobacco,—that's my taste. BURGHERS' DAUGHTERS. Look only at those brisk young fellows there! In sooth, 'tis more than one can bear; The best society have they if they please, And run after such low-bred girls as these! SECOND STUDENT to the first. Not quite so quick! there come up two behind, Spruce lasses both, I wot, and trim, My neighbour, too, is one of them; She is a girl quite to my mind. With quiet pace now move they on, But will be glad to wait for us anon. FIRST STUDENT. No, no! I have no patience for your ladies. Quick, brother, quick! before the game quite fled is. The maid whose week-day broom the chamber dresses, When Sunday comes, gives you the sweetest kisses. A BURGHER. No! this new burgo-master will not do! He seems to govern for himself alone; And since he was installed, what has he done For which the city's thanks are due? Affairs are getting worse from day to day, More than before we must obey, And more than ever must we pay. A BEGGAR, singing. Ye gentle sirs, and ladies fair, With clothes so spruce, and cheeks so red, O pass not by, but hear my prayer, Nor to the poor deny your aid! Let not me harp in vain! for blest Is he alone who gives away; And may this merry Easter-feast For me too be a holiday. ANOTHER BURGHER. On holidays and Sundays nothing pleases Me more than talk of war, and bruits of war, When in Turkey, distant far, The nations tear themselves to pieces. We sit i'the window, drink our glass at ease, And see how down the stream the gay ships softly glide; Then go we safely home at even-tide, And bless our stars we live in times of peace. THIRD BURGHER. Yes, neighbour, that is my way too. They may split their skulls in two, And, topsy-turvy, rant and riot; Only at home keep all things quiet. OLD WOMAN, to the Burghers' Daughters. Hey-day, how spruce! these be of gentle stuff! Whose heart against such tricks is sure? Only not quite so proud! 'Tis well enough— And what you wish I know how to procure. FIRST BURGHER'S DAUGHTER. Agathe come! I choose not to be seen With such old witches on the public green; Though on St Andrew's night she let me see My future husband bodily. SECOND BURGHER'S DAUGHTER. Mine too, bold, soldier-like, she made to pass, With his wild mates, before me in a glass; I seek him here, I seek him there, But nowhere deigns he to appear. SOLDIERS. Castles with turrets And battlements high, Maids with proud spirits, And looks that defy! Such are the prizes A soldier may claim, The greater the venture The greater the fame! The trumpet invites us, With soul-stirring voice, To where joy delights us, And death us defies. On storming maintain we Triumphant the field, Strong fortresses gain we, Proud maidens must yield. Thus carries the soldier The prize of the day, And merrily, merrily, Dashes away! SCENE II. Enter Faust and Wagner. FAUST. The ice is now melted from stream and brook By the Spring's genial life-giving look, And Hope forth smiles in the verdant vale; The ancient Winter, weak and frail, Hath drawn him back to the mountains grey; And thence he sends, as he hastens away, Powerless showers of icy hail, Sweeping over the green-clad plain; But the Sun may brook no white, The power of new life may nothing restrain, Bright paints he all with his life-giving light; And since few flowers yet deck the mead He takes him gay-dressed folks in their stead. Now from these heights let me turn me back To view the city's busy track. From the hollow gloomy gate In motley crowds they are pressing their way. All sun themselves so blithe to-day. Our Lord's resurrection they celebrate, Because themselves to life are arisen. From lowly dwellings' murky prison, From labour and business' fetters so tight, From the press of gables and roofs, and from The squeezing of narrow streets, do they come; From the churches' solemn night Have they all been brought to the light. Lo! how nimbly the multitude Through the fields and the gardens hurry, How, in its breadth and length, the flood Wafts onward many a gleesome wherry, And this last skiff moves from the brink So laden that it seems to sink. Ev'n from the distant hills is seen Their gaudy raiment's glittering sheen. I hear the hamlet's noisy rout, Here have the poor a heaven of their own, And great and small contented shout. Here must I be, here may I be a man. WAGNER. To walk, most learned sir, with you, Both honours me and profits too; And yet, alone I should not think it good To mingle with the thoughtless multitude, Being a foe to every thing that's rude. I cannot brook their senseless howling, Their fiddling, screaming, nine-pin-bowling. Like men possess'd, they rave along, And call it joy, and call it song. SCENE III. Peasants beneath a lime-tree. DANCE AND SONG. The shepherd for the dance was dress'd, With ribbon, wreathe, and yellow vest, Right sprucely did he show. And round and round the linden-tree All danced as mad as mad could be. Juchhe, juchhe! Juchheisa, heisa, he! So went the fiddle-bow. Then with a jerk he wheel'd him by, And on a maiden that stood nigh He with his elbow came; Brisk turn'd the girl, and, Sir, quoth she, Such game is rather rough for me. Juchhe, juchhe! Juchheisa, heisa, he! For shame, I say, for shame! Yet merrily went it round and round, And right and left they swept the ground, And all their mantles flew. And they were red, and they were warm, And, panting, rested arm in arm; Juchhe! juchhe! Juchheisa! heisa! he! And hips on elbows too. And, “softly, softly,” quoth the quean, “How many a bride hath cheated been By men as fair as you!” He spoke a word in her ear aside, And from the tree it shouted wide Juchhe! juchhe! Juchheisa! heisa! he! Halloo, and fiddle-bow. AN OLD PEASANT. Doctor, the boon we know to prize, That, though so famed the learned among, You on this day do not despise To mingle with the vulgar throng. Then from our hands the pitcher take, Which we have fill'd with water fresh, We bring it you, and loud we wish, Not only that your thirst it slake— The drops that it contains, may they, Each number to your life a day. FAUST. With thankful welcome I receive it, And wish all good to them that gave it. (The people collect round about him in a circle.) OLD PEASANT. In sooth, learned sir, 'tis very kind That mid our feasts you now appear, And help us to call back to mind How good in olden times you were. Here stand there living not a few Whom your most worthy father drew From the wild fever's ruthless rage, When he set limits to the plague. You, who were then a brave young man, Enter'd the hospitals every one, Though many corpses forth they bore, You came out healthful as before: Full many a test severe you stood Helping, help'd by the Father of Good. ALL THE PEASANTS. Long may the man who saved us live, His aid in future need to give! FAUST. To Him above your thanks be paid, Who aids alone, and sendeth aid. (He goes on farther with Wagner.) WAGNER. How proud must thou not feel, most learned man, To hear the praises of this multitude; Oh! happy he who from his talents can Derive such unadulterated good! The father shews you to his son, And all in crowds to see you run. The dancers cease their giddy round, And the fiddle stops its sound. They form a ring where'er you go, And in the air their hats they throw, A little more, and they would bend the knee, As if they saw the Venerabile. The Holy Host. FAUST. Yet a few paces, till we reach yon stone, And there may we our wearied strength repair. Here sat I oft, plunged in deep thought, alone, And wore me out with fasting and with prayer. Rich then in hope, in faith then strong, With tears and sobs my hands I wrung, And ween'd the end of that dire pest, From the will of Heaven to wrest. Now sounds their loud applause like mockery. Oh! could'st thou read it in my inward man, How little sire and son Of such bepraisings worthy be! My father was a stern old gentleman, Who Nature's holy secrets sought to trace, Sincere, but after his peculiar plan, With whimsical laboriousness; Who, in society of adepts spent His days, within the smoky kitchen pent, And, after recipes unnumber'd, made The unnatural mixtures of his trade. The Lion red, the Lily's tender frame, In tepid bath were closely wed together, And both were then, with open fiery flame, From one bride-chamber squeez'd into another: Appeared then in the glass the queen, With her many-coloured sheen, Here was the medicine, and the patient died, But no one questioned—who survived? And thus have we, with drugs more curst than hell, Within these vales, these mountains here, Raged than the very pest more fell! I have myself to thousands poison given; They pin'd away, and I must live to hear Men for the reckless murd'rers thanking heaven. WAGNER. How can you for such whims be grieved? 'Tis sure enough for any honest man, The art which from his fathers he received With conscientious care to carry on. When we, in youth, place on our sire reliance, He teaches us, his lore becomes our own; When we, as men, extend the bounds of science, Then may our sons improve what we have done. FAUST. O happy he who yet hath hope to merge Forth from the night of error's troubled surge! What most we need to know can ne'er be known, And what we know were better still unknown. But let us not this evening's fleeting joy By idle sadness thus destroy! Lo! where the glow of the descending sun Shimmers the green-encircled huts upon; He bends him down, his daily race is run, Yet with unwearied progress hies he on, New life to further in another sphere. Ah that no wing may from the ground me heave To follow still and still in his career! Then should I see, borne on the beam of eve, The silent world at my feet appear, Each flame-tipt height, each placid vale below, Each mountain-brook, whose silver waters flow, Into the golden river of the plain; The mountain wild, with ravines dark and wide, Might then oppose my godlike course in vain; Ev'n now, methinks, the ocean's genial tide Before my wondering vision opens wide. Yet seems the god at length to sink away; But, borne by this new impulse of my mind, I hasten onward on his quenchless ray, The day before me, and the night behind, The heavens above me, under me the sea. A lovely dream! meanwhile away fast fleeteth he. Alas! not soon the pinioned soul will find A wing to waft the body on the wind. Yet in each bosom is it deeply graven, With soaring feeling forward still to pant, When over us, lost in the blue of heaven, Her quavering song the lark doth chaunt; When over cliffy pine-girt peaks, The eagle hovers at his ease, And over plains, and over seas, The crane his native region seeks. WAGNER. I too have had my hours of revery But from such longings yet may boast me free. Of fields and forests one is quickly tired, The eagle's pinion have I ne'er desired. How otherwise the mind and its delights! From book to book, from page to page, we go. Thus sweeten we the dreary winter nights, New life we feel through all our members glow, And chance we but unrol some worthy parchment scroll, The very heavens descend upon our soul. FAUST. Thou know'st but the one impulse—it is well! Oh! may'st thou long be stranger to the other! Two souls, alas! within my bosom dwell, Whose hostile natures ceaseless strive together; The one, by stubborn power of love compelled, With clutching organs to the world is held; The other from earth's misty region soars To join the realms of high progenitors. Oh! be there spirits in the air, Betwixt the heavens and earth that hover, Descend ye from your golden atmosphere, And waft, to new and varied life, me over! Yes! were but an enchanted mantle mine, To distant climes that bore me on its wing, More than the costliest raiment I should prize it, More than the purple mantle of a king. WAGNER. Invoke not rash the well known spirit-throng, That stream unseen the atmosphere along, And dangers thousandfold prepare, Weak men from every quarter to ensnare. From the keen North in swarms they float, With sharpest teeth and arrow-pointed tongues; From Orient they bring a blasting drought, And feed their thirst upon thy lungs. When they invade thee from the desert South, Fire upon fire upheaping on thy crown, The West sends forth his swarms, which only soothe That thee and thine they may more surely drown. Quick-ear'd they are, on wanton mischief bent, And, listening, every cheating art they try, They show as fair as if from heaven sent, And lisp like angels when they lie. But let us hence! the world is grey-clad all, The air is cool'd, the mists of evening fall! 'Tis now that best we learn the worth of home to know— Why standest thou and starest wildly so? What twilight-vision can thy fancy trouble? FAUST. See'st thou that swarthy dog sweeping through corn and stubble? WAGNER. I saw him long ago—not strange he seem'd to me. FAUST. Look at him well—what should the creature be? WAGNER. He seems a poodle, snuffing at the wind, Who seeks in vain his master's track to find. FAUST. Dost thou not see, how nigher still and nigher His spiral circles round us wind? And, err I not, he leaves behind His path a train of sparkling fire. WAGNER. A small black poodle is all I see; Surely some strange delusion blinds thee! FAUST. Methinks soft magic circles winds he, To form a snare for thee and me. WAGNER. I see him only doubtful spring around, Having two strangers for his master found. FAUST. He draws him closer—now is he quite near! WAGNER. You see!—a dog, and not a ghost, is here. He growls, and crouches down, and looks at you, And wags his tail—as dogs are wont to do. FAUST. Come hither poodle! do not fear. WAGNER. It is, in sooth, a drollish brute, When you stand still then stands he mute, But, when you speak, he springs, as he would speak to you; He will bring back what you let fall, And for your stick into the water spring. FAUST. You are quite right—I can find no such thing As spirit here. Training has done it all. WAGNER. A dog who has received good education May claim ev'n from the wise consideration; In sooth, the poodle well deserves your favour, In meed of his most scholar-like endeavour. (Exeunt, going in through the gate of the town.) SCENE IV. Faust's Study. Faust entering with the Poodle. Hush'd now the field and meadow lies, Beneath the veil of deepest night, And solemn thoughts within us rise, Too holy for the garish light. Calm now the blood that wildly ran, Asleep the hand of lawless strife; Now wakes to life the love of man, The love of God now wakes to life. Quiet thee, poodle! why snuff'st thou so, Running restless to and fro? Come, couch thee down upon the hearth, Thou hast a comfortable berth. And as without, on the mountain-way, We joy'd to see thy gambols gay, So here, my hospitable care, A quiet guest, and welcome, share. When, in our narrow cell confined, The friendly lamp begins to burn, Then clearer sees the thoughtful mind, With searching looks that inward turn. Bright Hope again within us gleams, And Reason's voice again is strong; We thirst for life's untroubled streams, For the pure fount of life we long. Quiet thee, poodle! it seems not well To break, with thy snarling, the holy spell Of my soul's music, that may not be With bestial sounds in harmony. We are well used that men despise What to see they have no eyes, And murmur in their peevish mood Against the beautiful and good; Belike the cur, as curs are they, Thus growls and snarls his bliss away! But, alas! already I feel it well, No more may peace within this bosom dwell. Why must the stream so soon dry up, And I lie panting for the cup That mocks my thirsty lips? so often why Drink pleasure's shallow fount, when scarce yet tasted, dry? Yet is this evil not without remeid; We long for heavenly food to feed Our heaven-born spirit, and our heart, now bent On things divine, to revelation turns, Which no where worthier or purer burns, Than in the holy Testament. I feel strange impulse in my soul The sacred volume to unroll, With pious purpose, once for all, The holy Greek Original Into my honest German to translate. (He opens the Bible, and begins to read.) “In the beginning was the Word.” Stops here In ipso limine my course?—in vain I seek this mystic symbol to explain, Unless some god my inward vision clear. The naked word I dare not prize so high, I must translate it differently, If by the Spirit I am rightly taught. “In the beginning of all things was Thought.” The first line let me ponder well, Lest my pen outstrip my sense; Is it thought wherein doth dwell All-creative Omnipotence? I change the phrase, and safer write, In the beginning there was Might. But even here methinks some warning voice Makes me to waver in my choice— At length, at length, the Spirit helps my need! I write, “In the beginning was the Deed!” Wilt thou share the room with me, Poodle, thou must quiet be, Thou must cease thy snarls and howls, And keep for other place thy growls. Such a noisy inmate may Not my studious leisure cumber; You or I, without delay, Restless cur, must leave the chamber! Not willingly from thee I take The right of hospitality, But if thou wilt my quiet break, Seek other quarters—thou hast exit free. But what must I see! What vision strange Beyond the powers Of Nature's range! Am I awake, or bound with a spell? How wondrously the brute doth swell! Long and broad Uprises he, In a form that no form Of a dog may be! What spectre brought I into my house? He stands already, with glaring eyes, And teeth in grinning ranks that rise, Large as a hippopotamus! O! I have thee now! For such half-brood of hell as thou The key of Solomon the wise Is surest charm to exorcise. SPIRITS in the passage without. Brother spirits, have a care! One within is prisoner; Follow him none!—for he doth quail Like a fox, trap-caught by the tail. But let us watch! Hover here, hover there, Up and down amid the air; For soon this sly old lynx of hell Will tear him free, and all be well. Let us wait, a faithful crew, Here to help him, if we can, For he is our master true, And we love him every one. FAUST. First let the charm of the elements four The nature of the brute explore. Let the Salamander glow, Undene twine her crested wave, Silphe into ether flow, And Kobold vex him, drudging slave! Whoso knows not The elements four, Their quality, And hidden power, In the magic art Hath he no part. Melting in flames glow Salamander! Rushing in waves flow Undene! Shine forth in meteor-beauty Silphe! Work thy domestic duty Incubus Incubus! Step forth and finish the spell. None of the four In the brute doth dwell. It lies unmoved, and grins at my spell; I have not yet made it feel pain. With a stronger charm Thou shalt hear me again. Art thou a fugitive Urchin of hell? So yield thee at length To this holiest spell! Bend thee this sacred Emblem before, Which the powers of darkness Trembling adore. Already swells he up with bristling hair. Can'st thou read it, The holy sign, Reprobate spirit, The emblem divine? The unbegotten, Whom none can name, Whose word did the world's Infinity frame, Yet to death submitted Of sin and of shame? Now behind the stove he lies, And swells him up to an elephant's size, And seems as if he would fill the room, And melt into a cloud away. Down, proud spirit, downward come! And at thy master's feet thee lay! In vain, in vain, thou seek'st to turn thee, With an holy flame I burn thee! Wait not, spirit, wait not till My triple-flame I spread around thee! Wait not till my magic skill, With its mightiest charm hath bound thee! (The clouds vanish, and Mephistopheles comes forward from behind the fire-place, drest like an itinerant schoolmaster.) SCENE V. Faust and Mephistopheles. MEPHISTOPHELES. What's all the noise about? Learned sir, I stand Most humble servant here at your command. FAUST. 'Tis thus, then, that the poodle drops his mask! A travelling pedagogue? in verity, Most strange and ludicrous catastrophe! MEPHISTOPHELES. In sooth, sir, you have ta'en me hard to task, And made me sweat most valiantly. FAUST. How nam'st thou thee? MEPHISTOPHELES. Such question comes not well From one who so despises the mere letter, Whose thoughts, unbound by the material fetter, With Being's inmost substance only dwell. FAUST. Yes, but, with such as you, the outward name Serves as an index to the inward frame; Destroyer, God of Flies, the Adversary Apollyon, Beelzebub, Satan., Such names their own interpretation carry. But say, who art thou? MEPHISTOPHELES. A portion am I of that primal Will Which still produces good, though planning evil still. FAUST. You speak in riddles; the interpretation? MEPHISTOPHELES. I am the Spirit of Negation: And justly so; for all that is produced Deserves to nothingness to be reduced. 'Twere better, thus, that there were no production. You see, then, that my province is destruction, And all that men call wickedness and sin, The native element I live within. FAUST. Thou nam'st thyself a part, yet seem'st a whole to me. MEPHISTOPHELES. The modest truth I speak to thee, Though man, the little world of his soul Is apt to figure as a whole. I am a portion of that part which once Was all—a portion of old Night, From which was born, by most accursed chance, In primal ages the rebellious Light, Which now disputeth with its mother Night In ceaseless strife the world's high sovereignty, And yet may not succeed; for striving still To tear itself from clogging matter free, It cleaves to body fast against its will. From body streams it, body doth it paint, By body is its simple substance rent, And thus ere long, I hope, shall rebel Light, With body ruined lie in endless night. FAUST. Hold! now I know thy worthy duties all! Unable to annihilate wholesale, Thy mischief now thou workest by retail. MEPHISTOPHELES. And even thus, my progress is but small. This something, the plump world, which stands Opposed to nothing, still ties my hands, And spite of all the ground that I seem winning, Remains as firm as in the beginning; With storms and tempests, and earthquakes and burnings, The earth still enjoys its evenings and mornings, And the accursed fry of brute and human clay, On them my noblest skill seems worse than thrown away. How many thousands have I not buried! Yet still a new fresh blood is hurried Through other veins, with life reborn, That mocks the work of death to scorn, And almost makes me sheer despair. The earth, the water, and the air, The moist, the dry, the hot, the cold, A thousand germs of life unfold; And had I not of flame made reservation, I had no portion left in the creation. FAUST. And thus thou seekest to oppose The genial power, from which all life and motion flows, Against Existence' universal chain, Clenching thy icy devil's fist in vain! 'Twere time, strange son of Chaos, now to try Your hand at something that might bring more gain. MEPHISTOPHELES. The thing deserves attention certainly; We'll speak of that when I come back again. But for the present, with your leave, I crave permission to be gone. FAUST. I see not why you ask my leave, The liberty, methinks, is all your own. Now that I know you, you may visit me Whene'er you please, with ish and entry free. Here is the door, there is the window, and A chimney, if you choose it, is at hand. MEPHISTOPHELES. Let me speak plain! there is a small affair, That, without your assistance, bars my way, The goblin-foot upon the threshold there— FAUST. The pentagram stands in your way! Ha! tell me then, thou son of hell, If this be such a powerful spell To keep thee in; why kept it not thee out? What could have cheated such a powerful spirit? MEPHISTOPHELES. That is not hard to say, 'tis not well drawn, look near it; The farthest corner, that which is turn'd out Toward the door, is left a little open. FAUST. Sufficient for a poodle-dog to hop in! Here Fortune hit the nail upon the head; Thus were the devil Faustus' prisoner made! Chance is not always blind, as people say. MEPHISTOPHELES. The thoughtless cur saw nothing in its way. But now the matter looks more serious; The devil cannot move out of the house. FAUST. There is the window—'twere no weighty matter For one like you adown the wall to clatter. MEPHISTOPHELES. It is a law by which all spirits are bound, Wherever they creep in, there too they must creep out; I crept in at the door, at the door I must creep out. FAUST. Say'st thou that laws even in hell are found? Thus might one profit by the powers of evil, And make an honest bargain with the devil. MEPHISTOPHELES. The devil, sir, makes no undue exaction, And pays what he has promised to a fraction; But this affair requires consideration, We'll leave it for some future conversation. Meanwhile, most learned sir, with due submission, Hence to withdraw, again I crave permission. FAUST. I've scarce exchanged a single word with you, Give us your news before you bid adieu. MEPHISTOPHELES. I'll answer thee at length some other day; At present, I beseech thee, let me loose. FAUST. I laid no trap to snare thee in the way, Thyself did'st thrust thy head into the noose; Whoso hath caught the devil, hold him fast! Such lucky chance returns not soon again. MEPHISTOPHELES. If 'tis your pleasure so, I shall remain, But on condition that the time be pass'd In manner worthy of such company. And, Doctor Faust consent to see, Some specimens of magic art from me. FAUST. The fancy pleases me. Thou may'st commence, So that thy juggling tricks but please the sense. MEPHISTOPHELES. Thou shalt, in this one hour, my friend, More for thy noblest senses gain, Than in the year's dull formal train, From its beginning to its end. The songs the gentle spirits sing thee, The lovely visions that they bring thee, Are not an empty juggling show. On thine ear sweet sounds shall fall, Odorous breezes round thee blow, And thy raptured senses all Keener thrills of joy shall know. No lengthened prelude need we here, Sing, spirit-imps that hover near! SPIRITS. Vanish ye murky Old arches away! Through the blue ether Shine Heaven's ray! And be the dank clouds Melted away! Brighter the stars now Gem Heaven's crown, And purer suns now Softer look down. Myriads of spirits, A swift-moving throng, In beauty ethereal, Are waving along, And the soul follows With longings of fire; The fluttering garlands That deck their attire, Cover the meadows, Cover the bowers, Where love-enwrapt souls Spend the glad hours. Bower on bower! The shoots of the vine, With the leaves of the fig-tree, Their tendrils entwine! Clusters of ripe grapes, Bright-blushing all, Into the wine-press Heavily fall; Forth from their fountains Red foaming they go, And over sparkling Pebbles they flow; They spread into broad lakes Around the green slope, And their deep flood Is the fisherman's hope. And the birds of the ether Drink joy from the gale, To the realms of the sun On glad pinions they sail; They sail on swift wings To the isles of the blest, On the soft swelling waves That are cradled to rest; Where we hear the glad spirits Exultingly sing, As o'er the green meadows Fleet-bounding they spring: Disporting in free air, A numberless throng, Shooting like meteors The mountains along; Some there are swimming Over the seas, Hovering others On wings of the breeze; In life's joyful web Intermingling they twine, 'Mid the path of the starlets So lovely that shine. MEPHISTOPHELES. He sleeps! well done, ye airy urchins! I Remain your debtor for this lullaby, By which so bravely ye have sung asleep This restless spirit, who, with all his wit, Is not yet quite the man to keep the devil prisoner. Around him let your shapes fantastic flit, And in a sea of dreams his senses steep. But now this threshold's charm to disenchant, The tooth of a rat is all I want; Nor need I make a lengthen'd conjuration, I hear one scraping there in preparation. The lord of the rats and of the mice, Of the flies, and frogs, and bugs, and lice! Commands you with your teeth's good saw, The threshold of this door to gnaw; Forth come, and there begin to file Where he lets fall this drop of oil. Ha! there he jumps! that angle there, With thy sharp teeth I bid thee tear, Which jutting forward, sad disaster, Unwilling prisoner keeps thy master. Briskly let the work go on, One bite more and the task is done! (Exit.) FAUST. (awakening from his trance.) Am I then still the dupe of jugglery? And leaves this vision once again no trace, That I spake with the devil face to face, And that a poodle ran away from me? SCENE VI. Faust's Study as before. Faust. Mephistopheles. FAUST. Who's there to break my peace once more? come in! MEPHISTOPHELES. FAUST. Come in! MEPHISTOPHELES. Thou must repeat it thrice. FAUST. Come in then! MEPHISTOPHELES. Thus hast thou done well! I come to give you good advice, And hope that you will understand me. The idle fancies to expel, And silly whims, that quite unman thee, At your service behold me here, Of noble blood, a gallant cavalier, All sprucely clad in gala dress, A scarlet coat with golden lace, A short silk mantle, and a bonnet, With a gay cock's feather on it, And at my side a long sharp sword. Now listen to a well-meant word; Do thou the like, and follow me, All unembarrassed thus and free, The busy scenes of life to see. FAUST. Still must I suffer, clothe me as you may, This narrow earthly life's incumbrancy; I am too old to be content with play, Too young from every longing to be free. What can the world hold forth for me to gain? Abstain it saith, and still it saith Abstain! This is the burden of the song That in our ears eternal rings, The changeless tune, our whole life long, That each dull moment hoarsely sings. With terror wake I in the morn from sleep, And bitter tears I oftentimes might weep, To see the day, when its dull course is run, That shall fulfil not one small wish,—not one! That, with capricious criticizing, Each taste of joy within my bosom rising, Ere it be born, destroys, and brings to nought The fair creation of all-active thought, With thousand worthless trifles of an hour. And when I lay me, at the midnight hour, Anxious and weary, on my bed, Ev'n there I find no rest, and wild dreams spread Their terrors round my sleepless head. The god, that in my bosom dwells, Mine inmost soul can deeply shake; But he whose might my every power compels, No change upon the outer world can make. Thus my existence is a load of woes, Death my best friend, and life my worst of foes. MEPHISTOPHELES. And yet methinks is Death a guest That's seldom altogether to our taste. FAUST. Oh! happy he to whom, in victory's glance, Death round his brow the bloody laurel winds! Whom, 'mid the circling hurry of the dance, Lock'd in a maiden's close embrace he finds; O! would to God that I had sunk away Soulless before the mighty spirit's sway! MEPHISTOPHELES. Yet, on a certain night, a certain man was slow To drink a certain brown potation out. FAUST. It seems 'tis your delight to play the scout. MEPHISTOPHELES. Omniscient am I not; but many things I know. FAUST. If, in that moment's wild confusion, A well known tone of blithesome youth Had power, by memory's sweet delusion, To cheat me with the guise of truth; Then curse I all whate'er the soul With luring juggleries entwines, And in this gloomy dungeon-hole With dazzling flatteries confines! Curst be 'fore all the high opinion The soul has of its own dominion! Curst all the pictures we receive, Through outward sense, but to deceive! Curst be the hollow dreams of fame, Of honour, glory, and a name! Curst be the flatt'ring goods of earth, Our wife and child, our house and hearth! Accurs'd be Mammon, when with treasures To deeds of daring he invites us, Curst when, the slaves of passive pleasures, On soft-spread cushions he delights us! Curst be the balsam-juice o'the grape! Accurs'd be love's deceitful thrall! Accurs'd be Hope! accurs'd be Faith! Accurs'd be Patience above all! CHORUS OF SPIRITS, invisible. Woe! woe! Thou hast destroyed it! The beautiful world, With mightiest hand, A demigod In ruin has hurled! We weep, And bear its wreck'd beauty away, Whence it may never Return to the day. Mightiest one Of the sons of men, Brightest one, Build it again! In thine own bosom build it again! Life's glad career Anew begin, With senses clear, And soul within, While melodies sweet Thy progress greet! MEPHISTOPHELES. These are the tiny Spirits that wait on me; Hark how to pleasure And action they counsel thee! Into the world wide Would they allure thee, In solitude dull No more to immure thee, Where stagnates the blood, And humours the senses dim. Cease then to nurse thy peevish whim, That like a vulture makes thy life its food; Society, however low, Still gives thee cause to feel and know Thyself a man, amid thy fellow-men. Yet my intent is not to pen Thee up with the common herd of men: And though I cannot boast to be Of worldly rank and dignity, Yet do I offer, at thy side, Thy steps through mazy life to guide; And, wilt thou join in this adventure, I bind myself, by strong indenture, Here on the spot, with thee to go. I am thy comrade brave, And, if it better please thee so, I am thy servant, am thy slave! FAUST. And in return, what must I, say, As wages for thy service pay? MEPHISTOPHELES. Of that you may consider when you list. FAUST. No, no! the devil is an Egotist, And seldom gratis sells his labour, For love of God, to serve his neighbour. Speak boldly out, no private clause conceal, With such as you 'tis dangerous to deal. MEPHISTOPHELES. I bind myself to be thy servant here, And to thine every wink obedient be, If, when we meet again in yonder sphere, Thou pledge thyself to be the same to me. FAUST. What yonder is I little care to know, Provided I be happy here below; The future world will soon enough arise, When the present in ruin lies. 'Tis from this earth my stream of pleasure flows, This sun it is that shines on all my woes: And, am I once from this my home away, Then happen freely what happen may. Concern 'tis none of mine to hear, If then, as now, we hate and love; Or if in yonder world, as here, An under be, and an above. MEPHISTOPHELES. Thus seem'st thou in a favourable train, Advantage from my proffered aid to gain. Close with my plan, and thou shalt see Anon such pleasant tricks from me, As, on this earth, no son of man Hath witnessed since the world began. FAUST. Poor helpless devil, what hast thou to give, For which the spirit of a man might strive? That soul sublime, to know whose longings high The powers of thee and thine must still defy! True thou hast food that sateth never, And yellow gold that, restless ever, Like quicksilver between the fingers, Only to escape us, lingers, A game where we are sure to lose our labour, A maiden that, while hanging on my breast, With stolen looks unites her to my neighbour, And honour by which gods are blest, That, like a meteor, vanishes in air. Shew me the fruit that rots before 'tis broken, And trees that day by day their green repair! MEPHISTOPHELES. A word of mighty meaning thou hast spoken, Yet such commission makes not me despair. Believe me, friend, we only need to try it, And we too may enjoy our morsel sweet in quiet. FAUST. If ever, with composed mind, Upon a bed of sloth I lay me, My further fate with joy I leave thee! Canst thou with soothing flatteries sway me, That self-complacency I find, Canst with enjoyment thou deceive me, Then be my latent sand-grain run! A wager on it! MEPHISTOPHELES. Done! FAUST. And done, and done! When to the moment I shall say, Stay, thou art so lovely, stay! Then with thy fetters bind me round, Then perish I with cheerful glee! Then may the knell of death resound, Then from thy service art thou free! The clock may stand, And the falling hand Mark the time no more for me! MEPHISTOPHELES. Consider well: in things like these The devil's memory is not apt to slip. FAUST. That I know well; may'st keep thy heart at ease, Not rashly have I ventured on this step. Slave I remain, or here, or there, Thine, or another's, I little care. MEPHISTOPHELES. My duty I'll commence without delay, And at your festal banquet serve to-day. One thing remains!—black upon white A line or two, to make the bargain tight. FAUST. A writing craves the pedant slave alone, Who never man, nor word of man, hath known; My pledged word and faith I gave before, And bartered with my life—what wouldst thou more? If laws oppose the world's wild stream in vain, Deem'st thou a written word may me restrain? Yet 'tis a whim deep-graven in our heart, And from such fancies who would gladly part? Happy within whose honest breast concealed There lives a faith, no word may surer make! Yet still a parchment, written, stamped, and sealed, A spectre is before which all must quake. Commit but once thy word to the goose-feather, Then must thou yield the sway to wax and leather. Say, devil—paper, parchment, brass, or stone? This I leave to thee alone: Style, or chisel, or pen shall it be? Thou hast thy choice of all the three. MEPHISTOPHELES. What needs there that your hasty declamation Should puff into a flame at such a ration? Paper or parchment, any scrap will do, Then write in blood your signature thereto. FAUST. If this be all, there needs but small delay, Such trifles shall not stand long in my way. MEPHISTOPHELES. (while Faust is signing the paper.) Blood is a juice of most peculiar virtue. FAUST. Only no fear that I shall e'er demur to The bargain I at present strike with thee! The striving of my every faculty Is one with the promise I make to thee. Too high hath soared my blown-up pride, I sink down humbled at thy side, The Mighty Spirit of All hath scorned me, And Nature from her secrets spurned me: The thread of thought is rent in twain, All science I loathe with its wranglings vain. In the depths of sensual joy, let us tame Our glowing passion's restless flame! In magic veil, from unseen hand, Be wonders ever at our command! Plunge we us into the rushing of Time! Into Action's rolling main! Then let pleasure and pain, Loss and gain, Joy and sorrow, alternate chime! Change the world as it can, Still restless busy is the man. MEPHISTOPHELES. To thee I set nor bound nor measure, Every dainty thou may'st snatch at, Every flying joy may'st catch at, And take thy full of every pleasure, Only have courage, friend, and be not shy! FAUST. Thou markest well, I do not speak of joy, Pleasure that smarts, giddy intoxication, Enamour'd hate, and stimulant vexation. My bosom, from the thirst of knowledge free, To every human pang shall opened be, Mine inner self with every man shall share His portion of enjoyment and of care; Their deepest and their highest I will know, And on my bosom heap their weal and woe, My proper self unto their self extend, And with them too be wrecked, and ruined in the end. MEPHISTOPHELES. Believe thou me, who speak from test severe, Chewing the same hard food from year to year, There lives (were but the naked truth confest) No man who, from his cradle to his bier, The same old weary leaven can digest! Trust one of us—this universe so bright, He made it only for his own delight; Supreme he reigns, in endless glory shining, To utter darkness me and mine consigning, And grudges ev'n to you the day without the night. FAUST. But I will! MEPHISTOPHELES. There you are right! One thing alone gives me concern, The time is short, and we have much to learn. Methinks 'twere proper you should take instruction, And to some poet get an introduction; Then let the learned gentleman sweep Through the realms of imagination free, All qualities, that noble be, Upon your honoured crown to heap. The strength of the lion, The wild deer's agility, The fire of the south, With the north's durability. Then let his invention the secret unfold, To be crafty and cunning, yet generous and bold; Then teach your youthful blood, as poets can, To fall in love according to a plan. Myself have a shrewd guess where we might find A gentleman like this, quite to our mind, And Mr Microcosmus is he hight. FAUST. What am I then, if I may ne'er arrive To grasp the crown of manhood's perfect height, The goal where all my longing senses strive? MEPHISTOPHELES. Thou art, do what thou wilt, just what thou art. Heap wigs on wigs by millions on thy head, And upon yard-high buskins tread, Still thou remainest simply what thou art. FAUST. I feel it well, in vain have I uphoarded All treasures that the human mind afforded, And when I sit me down, I feel no more A well of life within me than before; Not ev'n one hairbreadth greater is my height, Not one inch nearer to the infinite. MEPHISTOPHELES. My worthy friend, these things you view, Just as they appear to you; Some wiser method we must shape us, Ere the joys of life escape us. Why, what the devil! hands and feet, And head and hinder parts are thine; And all that I enjoy, and eat, And drink, is it therefore less the mine? If I can number twice three horses, Are not all their muscles mine? I feel myself a man, and wheel my courses, As wight as four-and-twenty legs were mine. Quick then! have done with reverie, And dash into the world with me! I tell thee plain, a speculating fellow Is like an ox browsing on heath so yellow, Led in a circle by an evil spirit, While all around green fields are smiling near it. FAUST. But how shall we commence? MEPHISTOPHELES. We start this minute: Why what a place of torture is here, And what a life you live within it! Yourself and your pack of younkers dear, Killing outright with ennui! Leave that to honest neighbour Paunch! Thrashing of straw is not for thee: Besides, into the best of all your knowledge, You know 'tis not permitted you to launch With chicken-hearted boys at College. Ev'n now, methinks, I hear one come this way. FAUST. I have no heart to speak to him to-day. MEPHISTOPHELES. The poor lad waits you long, and may not stay, Disconsolate he must not go away: Come let me don thy doctor's cap and gown, The mask I know must fit me wondrously. (He puts on Faust's professorial robes.) How learn'd I look! now leave the rest to me! A quarter of an hour and I have done: Meanwhile thou make thee ready for thy journey. (Exit Faust.) MEPHISTOPHELES solus. Continue thus to hold at nought Man's highest power, his power of thought, Thus let the Father of all lies, With shows of magic, blind thine eyes, And thou art mine, a certain prize. To him hath Fate a spirit given, With reinless impulse ever forwards driven, Whose hasty striving overskips The joys that flow for mortal lips. Him drag I on through life's wild chase, Through flat unmeaning emptiness, He shall cling and cleave to me, Like a sprawling child in agony, And food and drink his cravings to defy, Before insatiate lips shall hover nigh; In vain for satisfaction shall he sigh, And though he ne'er had sold him to the devil, Of such a spirit nought could come but evil. SCENE VII. Enter a Student. STUDENT. I am but fresh arrived to-day, And come my best respects to pay, To a man whose name, from boor to Kaiser, None, without veneration, mention. MEPHISTOPHELES. I feel obliged by your attention! You see a man than other men no wiser: Have you made inquiry elsewhere? STUDENT. Beseech you, sir, be my adviser! I come with money enough and to spare, With fresh young blood, and a merry heart, On my college career to start: My mother sent me, not without hesitation, To pick up here some useful information. MEPHISTOPHELES. A better place you could not find. STUDENT. To speak the truth, 'tis not much to my mind. Within these narrow cloister walls, These antiquated gothic halls, I feel myself but ill at ease; No spot of green I see, no trees, And 'mid your formal rows of benches, I almost seem to lose my senses. MEPHISTOPHELES. That all depends on custom: Thus we see A child, whose mouth at first is slow Its native mother's breast to know, Soon learns to nurse itself with glee. Ev'n thus will you, each day you live, On the breasts of wisdom better thrive. STUDENT. 'Twere my delight to do so even now; But, in the first place, you must tell me how? MEPHISTOPHELES. Before you can receive my lessons You must make choice of the professions. STUDENT. I aim at universal erudition, And whatsoever of great or splendid In heaven or earth is comprehended, Science and Nature's wide extent, I seek to know from your tuition. MEPHISTOPHELES. There you are on the proper scent; Only beware of too much distraction. STUDENT. My soul and body are girt for action, And yet I cannot choose but praise A little freedom and merriment, On pleasant summer holidays. MEPHISTOPHELES. Redeem the time, for fast it fleets away, But Order teaches us its course to stay. First, therefore, would you do as I do, To study logic I advise you. There will your mind be properly dress'd, And in Spanish boots uplaced, That thus, with the greater consideration, On the path of thought it may creeping go, And not with flickering gyration, Will-o'-the-wisp it to and fro. There will you learn that a stroke of thinking, Which you had practised once as free And natural as eating and drinking, Cannot be made without one! two! three! True, it should seem that the fabric of thought Is like a web by cunning master wrought, Where one stroke moves a thousand threads, The shuttle shoots backwards and forwards between, The slender threads flow together unseen, And one with the others thousand-fold weds: Then steps the philosopher forth to shew How of necessity it must be so: If the first be so, the second is so, And therefore the third and the fourth is so; And unless the first and the second before be, The third and the fourth can never more be. Such is the language of all the schools, And yet, with all their learned endeavour, And all their syllogistic rules, Not one of them e'er became a weaver. He who strives to know a thing well Must first the spirit within expel, Then can he count the parts in his hand, Only without the spiritual band. Encheiresis naturæ, 'tis clept in Chemistry, Thus laughing at herself, albeit she knows not why. STUDENT. I must confess I can't quite comprehend you. MEPHISTOPHELES. In this respect will time soon mend you, When you have learned to decompose, And in classes and orders to dispose. STUDENT. I feel as stupid to all he has said, As a mill-wheel were whirling round in my head. MEPHISTOPHELES. After logic, first of all, To the study of metaphysics fall! There strive to know what ne'er was made To go into the human head; For what is within and without its command A high-sounding word is always at hand. But chiefly, for the first half year, Let order in all your studies appear. Five lectures a-day, that no time be lost! And with the clock be at your post! Come not, as some, without preparation, And well his learned paragraphs con you all, To be able to say, when you hear his oration, That it nothing contains but what stands in his manual; Yet not the less take down his words in writing, As if the Holy Spirit were inditing! STUDENT. I shall not quickly give you cause To repeat so weighty a clause; For what black upon white is written, We take it home, a tangible possession. MEPHISTOPHELES. But, as I said, you must choose a profession. STUDENT. With Law, I must confess, I never was much smitten. MEPHISTOPHELES. I should be loath to force your inclination, Myself have some small skill in legislation; For human laws and rights from sire to son, Like an hereditary ill, flow on; From generation dragged to generation, And creeping slow from place to place. Reason is changed to nonsense, good to evil, Art thou a grandson, woe betide thy case! Of Law they prate, most falsely clept the Civil, But as to right, with which we all are born, They name it not, or name it but to scorn. STUDENT. Your words have much increased my detestation. O happy he, to whom such guide points out the way! And now, I almost feel an inclination To give Theology the sway. MEPHISTOPHELES. I have no wish to lead you astray. As to this science, 'tis so hard t'eschew The false way, and to hit upon the true, And so much hidden poison lurks within, That's scarce distinguished from the medicine. Methinks that here 'twere safest done That you should listen but to one, And jurare in verba magistri Is the best maxim to assist ye. Upon the whole, I counsel thee To stick to words as much as may be, For such will still the surest way be Into the temple of certainty. STUDENT. But surely every word must have a meaning. MEPHISTOPHELES. Yes, but we must not probe too anxiously its meaning; For, just when our ideas fail us, A well-coined word may best avail us. Words are best weapons in disputing, In system-building and uprooting, To words most men will swear, though mean they ne'er so little, From words one cannot filch a single tittle. STUDENT. I crave your pardon, sir, if I appear Your time with many questions to detain; But if it be not irksome, I would fain On Medicine, too, some pithy maxim hear. Three years, God knows, fleet fast away, And the field of study wide is. Ev'n with a single hint to guide us, 'Tis easier far to find our way. MEPHISTOPHELES. (aside.) I'm weary of this dry pedantic strain, 'Tis time to play the genuine devil again. (Aloud.) The spirit of Medicine 'tis not hard to seize: The world, both great and small, ye seek to know, That in the end ye may let all things go As God shall please. In vain you range around with scientific eyes, Each one at length learns only what he can; But he who knows the passing hour to prize, That is the proper man. A goodly shape and mien you vaunt, And confidence you will not want, Trust but yourself, and, without more a-do, All other men will straightway trust you too. But chiefly be intent to get a hold O'the women's minds: their endless Oh! and Ah! So thousandfold, In all its change, obeys a single law, And if with half a modest air you come, You have them all beneath your thumb. A title first must purchase their reliance, That you have skill surpassing vulgar science; Thus have you hold at once of all the seven ends, Round which another years of labour spends. Study to press the pulse right tenderly, And, with a sly and fiery eye, To hold her freely round the slender waist, That you may see how tightly she is lac'd. STUDENT. This seems to promise better; here we see, More tangibly at least, the where and how. MEPHISTOPHELES. Grey, my good friend, is every theory, But green the golden tree of life doth grow. STUDENT. I vow I feel as in a dream, my brain Contains much more than it can comprehend; Some other day may I come back again, To hear your wisdom to the end. MEPHISTOPHELES. The little that I have you may command. STUDENT. Excuse me, sir; from you I might not sever Till first my album I deliver; A learned maxim, written by your hand, I should esteem a most peculiar favour. MEPHISTOPHELES. Most willingly. (He writes, and gives back the book.) STUDENT. (reads.) Eritis sicut Deus scientes bonum et malum. (He closes the book reverently, and takes his leave.) MEPHISTOPHELES. Follow the ancient saw, and my cousin, the famous old Serpent, Right soon shalt thou have cause, at thy godlike knowledge to tremble! Enter Faust. FAUST. Now, whither bound? MEPHISTOPHELES. Where'er it pleases you; The world, both great and small, we view. O! how it shall delight, entrance you, The merry race of life to dance through! FAUST. My beard, I am afraid, is rather long; And without easy manners, gentle breeding, I fear there is small chance of our essay succeeding; I feel so awkward mid the busy throng, So powerless and so insignificant, And what all others have I seem to want. MEPHISTOPHELES. Be not concern'd, good friend, that comes of course, Trust but thyself, and straight thou know'st the art to live. FAUST. But, first, I see not how we shall contrive To leave the house, without or chaise or horse. MEPHISTOPHELES. We only need your mantle to unfold, And it shall waft us on the wind. Who makes with me this journey bold No bulky bundle busks behind; A single puff of inflammable air, And from the ground we nimbly fare. Lightly we float. I wish the best of cheer To Doctor Faustus on his new career. END OF ACT THE SECOND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Auerbach's Wine-Cellar. Leipzig. A BOUT OF MERRY FELLOWS. FROSCH. Will no one sing? none crack a joke? I'll teach you to make saucy faces! Like old wet straw to-day you smoke, While bright as flame your wonted blaze is. BRANDER. The blame lies with yourself, for you have given us To-day no fun nor frolic to enliven us. FROSCH. (throwing a glass of wine over his head.) There hast thou both then! BRANDER. Double swine! FROSCH. You asked a joke—I gave it you in wine! SIEBEL. Out at the door with all who dare to quarrel! Drink, roar, and sing out from your lungs' good barrel! Up! hollo! ho! ALTMAYER. Woe's me! the devil and all his crew are here! Some cotton, ho! he makes my ear-drum crack. SIEBEL. Roar on! for, when the vault loud echoes back, The sonorous bass best thunders to the ear. FROSCH. Right, right! out with each saucy fellow! A! tara lara da! ALTMAYER. A tara lara da! FROSCH. Our throats are now quite mellow. (Sings.) The holy Roman empire now, How does it hold together? A clumsy song!—deuce take your politics! You may thank God, each day you ope your eye, sir, The Roman empire can give you small pain; For me, I reckon it the greatest gain That I am neither Chancellor nor Kaiser. Yet even we must have a head to rule us; Let's choose a pope in drinking well to school us, Come, well you know the qualification That lifts a man to consideration. FROSCH. (sings.) Mount up, lady nightingale, Greet my love ten thousand times. SIEBEL. No, sir, not once,—I'll hear no more of this. FROSCH. But you shall hear!—A greeting and a kiss! (He sings.) Ope the door in silent night. Ope and let me in, I pray; Shut the door, the morn is bright, Shut it love, I must away! SIEBEL. Yes! sing and sing! praise and bepraise her too! I shall have laughing soon, I warrant you. The jade has jilted me! thee will she treat no better. I would some Kobold for his wife might get her, Upon some lone cross road with her to toy; Or that some old he-goat, that tramps away From merry Blocksberg on the first of May, Might serenade her as he gallops by. An honest man of genuine flesh and blood Is for the wench by far too good. No other greeting will I give her Than all her window-panes to shiver! BRANDER. (striking the table.) Gentlemen hear! only attend to me, And you shall see that I know how to live. If love-sick people here there be, In compliment to them, I'm bound to give A song brim-full of the most melting passion. I'll sing a ditty of the newest fashion! Attend, and join all merry in the chorus! [BRANDER] (He sings.) In a pantry-hole there liv'd a rat, On bacon and on butter, It had a paunch as round and fat As honest Doctor Luther. The cook plac'd poison in its way, It felt as straiten'd all the day, As if it had love in its body. CHORUS. (shouting.) As if it had love in its body. BRANDER. It ran within, it ran without, And sipp'd in every puddle, And scratch'd and gnaw'd, but better'd not The fever of its noddle. With many a gasp it tossed and toss'd, Seem'd ready to give up the ghost, As if it had love in its body. CHORUS. As if it had love in its body. BRANDER. It left its hole for very pain, Into the kitchen crawling, And snorting there with might and main, Upon the hearth lay sprawling. The cook she laugh'd when she saw it die, It squeaks, quoth she, with its latest sigh, As if it had love in its body. CHORUS. As if it had love in its body. SIEBEL. How the hard-hearted boys rejoice! As if it were a trade so choice To poison the poor rats and mice. BRANDER. You seem to eye them with peculiar favour. ALTMAYER. The oily paunch! the bald pate, the!— He is most meek and piteous ever; In the poor rat at once he knew His counterfeit—most passing true! SCENE II. Enter Faust and Mephistopheles. MEPHISTOPHELES. First thing of all, here must you see, A merry laughing company, That you may learn how easy men contrive Without much thought or care to live. These fellows feast their lives away In a continual holiday; With little wit and much content Their narrow ring of life is spent, As playful kittens oft are found To chase their own tails round and round. So live they on from day to day, As long as headach keeps away, And by no anxious thought are cross'd, While they get credit from their host. BRANDER. These gentlemen in Leipzig seem quite green, More perfect strangers I have seldom seen; They are not an hour arrived I warrant thee. FROSCH. There you are right!—Leipzig's the place, I say! It is a little Paris in its way. SIEBEL. What think you may the strangers be? FROSCH. Leave that to me!—I'll soon fish out the truth. Fill me a bumper till it overflows, And then I'll draw the worms out of their nose, As easily as 'twere an infant's tooth. To me they seem to be of noble blood, They look so discontented and so proud. BRANDER. Quack doctors both!—Altmayer, what think you? ALTMAYER. 'Tis like. FROSCH. Mark me! I'll make them feel the screw. MEPHISTOPHELES. (to FAUST.) They have no nose to smell the devil out, Even when he has them by the snout. FAUST. Be greeted, gentlemen! SIEBEL. With much respect return we the salute. (Softly, eyeing Mephistopheles from the one side.) What! does the fellow limp upon one foot? MEPHISTOPHELES. With your permission, we will make so free, As to intrude upon your company. And though the host's poor wines may keep us in so briety, We shall at least enjoy your good society. ALTMAYER. He seems a man of most fastidious taste. FROSCH. When left you Rippach? you must have been press'd For time. Supp'd you with Squire Hans by the way? MEPHISTOPHELES. We had no time to stay! But when I last came by, I was his guest. He spoke much of his cousins, and he sent To you and all full many a compliment. (He makes a bow to Frosch.) ALTMAYER. (softly.) You have him there!—he understands the jest! SIEBEL. He is a knowing one! FROSCH. I'll sift him through anon! MEPHISTOPHELES. As we came in, a concert struck my ear Of skilful voices in a chorus pealing! A gleesome song must sound most nobly here, Re-echoed freely from the vaulted ceiling. FROSCH. Perhaps you have yourself some skill? MEPHISTOPHELES. O no! had I the power, I should not want the will. ALTMAYER. Give us a song! MEPHISTOPHELES. A thousand, willingly! SIEBEL. Only split-new, I say!—no thread-bare strain! MEPHISTOPHELES. We are but just come from a tour in Spain, The lovely land of wine and melody. (He sings.) There was a king in old times That had a huge big flea— FROSCH. Ha, ha! a flea!—he seems a man of taste! A flea, I wis, is a most comely guest? MEPHISTOPHELES. (sings again.) There was a king in old times That had a huge big flea, As if it were his own son, He lov'd it mightily. He sent out for the tailor, To get it a suit of clothes; He made my lord a dress-coat, He made him a pair of hose. BRANDER. Be sure that Monsieur le Tailleur be told To take his measure with the greatest nicety, And as upon his head he puts a price, he Shall make the hose without a single fold! MEPHISTOPHELES. In velvet and in silk clad Then strutted he about, With laces rich and garters And cross on cross to boot. Prime minister they made him, With stars in rich array; And then all his relations At court had much to say. This caus'd sore vexation The courtiers among, The queen and all her ladies Were bitten and were stung. And yet they durst not crack 'em, Nor brush the fleas away; But we to death are crack'd all And bitten every day. CHORUS. (shouting.) But we to death are crack'd all And bitten every day. FROSCH. Bravo, bravo!—his voice is quite divine. SIEBEL. Such fate may every flea befall! BRANDER. Point your fingers, and crack 'em all! ALTMAYER. A glass to liberty!—long live the vine! MEPHISTOPHELES. For such a cause, would I a brimming bumper fill, If we had only better wine to drink. SIEBEL. You might have kept that to yourself, I think! MEPHISTOPHELES. I only fear our host might take it ill, Else should I give to every honour'd guest From our own cellar of the very best. SIEBEL. O never fear!—If you but give the wine, Our host shall be content—the risk be mine! FROSCH. Give me a flowing glass, and praise you shall not want, So that your sample, mark me! be not scant; I cannot judge of wine, unless I fill My mouth and throat too with a goodly swill. ALTMAYER. (softly.) I see the gentlemen are from the Rhine. MEPHISTOPHELES. Give me a borer here!—I'll show you precious wine. BRANDER. (aside.) What would the fellow bore? Has he then wine-casks at the door? ALTMAYER. There, in the basket, you will find a store Of tools, which our good landlord sometimes uses. MEPHISTOPHELES. (taking the borer.) (to FROSCH.) Now every one may taste of what he chooses. FROSCH. Have you all sorts?—or do you mean to quiz us? MEPHISTOPHELES. I offer each whatever wine he pleases. ALTMAYER. (to FROSCH.) Aha! I see you lick your lips already. FROSCH. Give me a bumper of good native Rhenish; 'Tis better far than all your French or Spanish. MEPHISTOPHELES. (boring a hole in the edge of the table where Frosch is sitting.) Fetch me a little wax, to make the stoppers ready. ALTMAYER. He means to put us off with jugglery. MEPHISTOPHELES. (to BRANDER.) And you, Sir, what? BRANDER. Champaigne for me! And brisk and foaming let it be! (Mephistopheles bores, meanwhile one of the party has got the stoppers ready, and closes the holes.) BRANDER. To foreign climes a man must sometimes roam, In quest of things he cannot find at home. For Frenchmen Germans have no strong affection, But to their wines we seldom make objection. SIEBEL. (while Mephistopheles is coming round to him.) I have no taste for your sour wines to-day, I wish to have a swig of good Tokay. MEPHISTOPHELES. (boring.) That you shall have, and of the very best. ALTMAYER. No, gentlemen!—'tis plain you mean to jest; If so, in me you much mistake your man. MEPHISTOPHELES. Ha! ha!—no little risk, methinks, I ran To venture tricks with noble guests like you. Come! make your choice, speak boldly out, and I Shall do my best your wish to gratify. ALTMAYER. Give me what wine you please!—only not much ado. (After having bored and stopped up all the holes,) MEPHISTOPHELES. (with strange gestures.) Grapes on the vine grow! Horns on the goat! The wine is juicy, the vine is of wood, The wooden table can give it as good. Look into Nature's depths with me! Whoso hath faith shall wonders see! Now draw the corks, and quaff the wine! ALL. (drawing the corks, and quaffing the out-streaming liquor, each as he had desired.) O blessed stream!—O fount divine! MEPHISTOPHELES. Drink on! only be cautious in your hurry. (They drink freely.) ALL. (singing.) We feast like cannibals divine, Drink like five hundred swine! MEPHISTOPHELES. (to FAUST.) Look at the fellows now!—are they not merry? FAUST. I feel inclined to go!—'tis getting late. MEPHISTOPHELES. Soon shall we have a glorious revelation Of bestiality, if you but wait. SIEBEL. (drinks carelessly; the wine falls to the ground and becomes flame.) Help! fire! the devil's here! death and damnation. MEPHISTOPHELES. (addressing him to the flames.) Peace, friendly element! be still! (To the company.) This time 'twas but a drop of purgatorial flame. SIEBEL. What's that?—your impudence we soon will tame! It seems you little know with whom you deal. FROSCH. 'Twere dangerous to repeat such gambols here! ALTMAYER. Methinks 'twere best to whisper in his ear That he had better leave the room. SIEBEL. What, sirrah? do you then presume To play your hocus-pocus here? MEPHISTOPHELES. Peace, old wine-cask! SIEBEL. You broomstick you! Must we then bear your insolence too? BRANDER. Wait! wait! it shall rain blows anon! ALTMAYER. (Draws a stopper from the table, and fire rushes out on him.) I burn! I burn! SIEBEL. There's witchcraft in his face! The fellow is an outlaw! strike him down! (They draw their knives and run against Mephistopheles.) MEPHISTOPHELES. (with serious mien.) False be eye, and false be ear! Change the sense, and change the place! Now be there, and now be here! (They look as thunderstruck, and stare at one another.) ALTMAYER. Where am I? in what lovely land? FROSCH. Vineyards! can it be so? SIEBEL. And grapes too quite at hand! BRANDER. And here beneath this shady tree, This noble vine, these blushing clusters see! (He seizes Siebel by the nose. The rest seize one another in the same manner, and lift up their knives.) MEPHISTOPHELES. (as above.) Let Error now their eyes unclose, The devil's joke to understand! (He vanishes with Faust. The fellows start back from one another.) SIEBEL. What's the matter? ALTMAYER. How now? FROSCH. Was that your nose? BRANDER (to SIEBEL.) And yours is in my hand! ALTMAYER. It was a stroke through my whole body went! Give me a chair!—I sink, I faint! FROSCH. Now tell me only what has been the matter? SIEBEL. Where is the fellow? Could I catch him here, His life out of his body I should batter! ALTMAYER. I saw him just this instant disappear, Riding upon a wine-cask—I declare I feel a weight like lead about my feet. (Turning to the table.) I wonder if his d?d wine still be there! SIEBEL. There's not a single drop; 'twas all a cheat. FROSCH. And yet methinks that I was drinking wine. BRANDER. And I could swear I saw a cluster'd vine. ALTMAYER. Let none now say the age of miracles is past! SCENE III. Witches' Kitchen. A cauldron is seen boiling on a low hearth. Numbers of strange fantastic figures tumbling up and down in the smoke. A Mother-Cat-Ape sits beside the cauldron, taking off the scum, and keeping it from boiling over. An Old Cat-Ape beside her warming himself with his young ones. Roof and walls are covered over with a strange assortment of furniture, and implements used by witches. Enter Faust and Mephistopheles. FAUST. I cannot brook this noisy bedlam crew: Deem'st thou I shall my worn-out age renew Within this den of sheer insanity? Shall an old beldam give me what I lack? Can all the brewings of her scullery Shake off full thirty summers from my back? Woe's me, if better project thou hast none! I feel my noblest hopes already gone. Has Nature then, and has some noble Spirit, No balsam for the body to repair it? MEPHISTOPHELES. My friend, with your great sense I cannot but be smitten! Nature, too, boasts a plan to renovate your age; But in a wondrous volume is it written, And wondrous is the chapter and the page. FAUST. But I must know it. MEPHISTOPHELES. Good! the poorest man may try it, Without or witch, or quack, or gold to buy it; And yet it works a certain cure. Go take thee with the peasant to the moor, And straight begin to hew and hack; Confine thee there, with patient mood, Within the narrow beaten track, And nourish thee with simplest food; Live with the brute a brute, and count it not too low To dung the corn-fields thine own hands shall mow; Than this I know on earth no med'cine stronger, To make, by fourscore years, both soul and body younger! FAUST. I was not trained to this—was never made To labour with the pick-axe and the spade. My spirit soars too high for your vile clay. MEPHISTOPHELES. Then must we take the witch into our pay. FAUST But why this self-same ugly Jezebel? Could you not brew the drink yourself as well? MEPHISTOPHELES. That were a dainty pastime to be sure! Meanwhile I might have built a thousand bridges, Across a thousand mountain-ridges. Not art, and science strict, are here enough, But patience too, and perseverance tough. A thoughtful soul toils on through many a silent year, Time only makes the busy ferment clear. Besides that the ingredients all, They are most strange and mystical! 'Tis true I gave them the receipt from hell, But how to make the drug I cannot tell. (Looking at the Cat-Apes.) Lo! what a tiny gay parade! Here's the man, and there's the maid! (Addressing them.) It seems that your good mother has gone out? THE CAT-APES. Up the chimney, Went she out, To a drinking bout! MEPHISTOPHELES. Is it her wont to gossip long without? THE ANIMALS. As long as we sit here and warm our feet. MEPHISTOPHELES. (to FAUST.) What think you of the brutes? are they not neat? FAUST. I never saw such tasteless would-be-drolls! MEPHISTOPHELES. Pooh! pooh!—I know no greater delectation On earth, than such a merry conversation. (To the brutes.) Now let us hear, you pretty dolls, What stir you round in the cauldron so? THE BRUTES. Soup for beggars, through and through, Thin and watery, we brew. MEPHISTOPHELES. You will have customers enow. THE FATHER CAT-APE. (comes up and fawns upon Mephistopheles.) Come rattle the dice, Make me rich in a trice, Come, come, let me gain! My case is so bad, It scarce could be worse, Were I right in my purse, I'd be right in my brain! MEPHISTOPHELES. How happy would the apish creature be, To get a ticket in the lottery! (Meanwhile the young Cat-Apes have been playing with a large globe, and roll it forwards.) THE FATHER CAT-APE. Such is the world, So doth it go, Up and down, To and fro! Like glass doth it tinkle, Like glass doth it twinkle, Breaks in a minute, Has nothing within it; Here doth it sparkle, There doth it darkle, I am alive! My dear son, I say, Keep out of the way! You will die, you will die! It is but of clay, And in pieces will fly! MEPHISTOPHELES. What make you with the sieve? THE FATHER CAT-APE. (bringing down the sieve.) When comes a thief, On the instant we know him. (He runs off to the Mother Cat-Ape, and lets her look through the sieve.) Look through the sieve! See'st thou the thief, And fearest to show him? MEPHISTOPHELES. (coming near the fire.) And this pot? FATHER CAT-APE AND HIS WIFE. The silly sot! He knows not the pot! And the cauldron not! MEPHISTOPHELES. You ill-bred urchin you! THE FATHER CAT-APE. Come, sit thee down, We'll give thee a crown, And a sceptre too! (He obliges Mephistopheles to sit down, and gives him a long brush for a sceptre.) FAUST. (Who, while Mephistopheles was engaged with the animals, had been standing before a mirror, alternately approaching to it and retiring from it.) What see I?—what a lovely image here, Within this magic mirror, do I see! O Love, thy swiftest pinion lend thou me, That it may waft me to her balmy sphere! Alas! when I attempt to come more nigh, I see her still receding from mine eye, And in a cloudy distance disappear! The fairest form of woman that hath met My eyes, among fair Eva's daughters yet! There lies she, on that downy couch reposing, Within herself the heaven of heavens enclosing! Can it then be that earth a thing so fair contains? MEPHISTOPHELES. Of course: for when a god has vex'd his brains For six long days, and, when his work is done, Says Bravo to himself, he must produce Something above the common I should think. This time gaze on so long as thou shalt choose; I know how to procure you such an one, From whom thou may'st thy fill of pleasure drink; And blest the man, for whom Fate shall decide, To lead home such a treasure as his bride! (Faust continues gazing on the mirror. Mephistopheles stretches himself on the arm-chair, and, playing with the brush, goes on as follows.) Here sit I like a king upon a throne, A sceptre I have here, my crown they bring anon. THE ANIMALS. (Who had in the interval been making strange antic motions through one another, bring a crown to Mephistopheles, with loud shouts.) O be but so good, With sweat and with blood, Your crown to glue, As monarchs do! (They use the crown rather roughly, in consequence of which it falls into two pieces, with which they jump about.) Alas! alas! It falls with a crash! We hear and we see, And we rhyme merrily! FAUST. (gazing on the mirror.) Woe's me! her beauty doth my wits confound. MEPHISTOPHELES. (pointing to the brutes.) And even my good brain is whirling round and round. THE BRUTES. And if we well speed, As speed well we ought, 'Tis a pretty conceit, 'Tis a clever thought. FAUST. (as above.) My breast begins with fire to glow! Come now, Mephisto—let us go! MEPHISTOPHELES. (as above.) One must, at least, confess that they Are honest poets in their way. (The kettle, which had been neglected by the Mother Cat-Ape, begins to boil over: A great flame arises, and runs up the chimney. The Witch comes through the flame, down the chimney, with a terrible noise.) THE WITCH. Ow! ow! ow! ow! Thou damned brute! thou cursed sow! To leave the kettle, and singe the frow! Thou curst imp, thou! (Turning to Faust and Mephistopheles.) Who are these there? How came they here? What do they want? They are scouts! they are scouts! Out with the louts! A fiery arrow Consume their marrow! (She plunges the ladle into the kettle, and spurts out flame on Faust, Mephistopheles, and the Brutes. These last whine.) MEPHISTOPHELES. (Who, in the mean time, had turned round the butt-end of the brush, now dashes in amongst the pots and glasses.) In two! in two! There lies the broth! The glass and the kettle, Shiver them both! 'Tis a jest, thou must know, Thou carrion-crow! 'Tis a tune to keep time, To thy senseless rhyme. (While the Witch, foaming with rage and fury, draws back.) What! know'st me not? thou hag! thou skeleton! Thy lord and master dost not own? Thy sov'reign, who can smash thee when he pleases With all thy cat-imps in a thousand pieces? Know'st not the scarlet-doublet, mole-eyed mother? Bow'st not the knee before the fam'd cock's feather? Was then my face within a vizor buried? And must I write my name upon my forehead? THE WITCH. O my liege lord! forgive the rough salute! I did not see the horse's foot: And where too have you left your pair of ravens? MEPHISTOPHELES. For this time you may thank the heavens That you have come so cheaply off; It is, I must confess, long time enough, And more than should be, honest mother, Since you and I last spake together. Besides, the march of modern cultivation Has made the devil too a man of fashion; All things are now so smooth, the famous Northern Devil Meets everywhere with treatment most uncivil. And now must horns, and claws, and tail, and hoof, From an enlightened age be kept aloof: As for the horse's foot, once of such notoriety, It would now bar me quite from good society; And I, as modern dandies do, must use A stuffing to fill up my boots and shoes. THE WITCH, dancing. Heyday! it almost turns my brain To see Squire Satan here again! MEPHISTOPHELES. Woman, you must not call me by that name! THE WITCH. And wherefore not? I see no cause for shame. MEPHISTOPHELES. That name has had its station long assigned With other fables: but the human kind, With all its wisdom, still seems much the same. The wicked one is gone, the wicked stay behind. You call me Baron now, less would be rude— I am a cavalier like other cavaliers, You cannot mean to doubt my noble blood, Here is a coat of arms that all the world reveres. (He makes an indecent gesture.) THE WITCH. (laughing immoderately). Ha! ha! now I perceive Old Nick is here! You are a knave still as you always were. MEPHISTOPHELES. (aside to FAUST.) My friend, this hour in lessons rich is, How one ought to deal with witches. THE WITCH. Now say, good sirs, what would you have with me? MEPHISTOPHELES. A glass of your restoring beverage, And of the oldest let it be; You know the strength is doubled with its age. THE WITCH. Most willingly. Here I have got a phial Of which myself at times make trial, 'Tis now a pleasant mellow potion! You shall not meet with a denial. (Softly.) Yet if this worthy man drinks it without precaution, He cannot live, you know, a single hour thereafter. MEPHISTOPHELES. He is a friend, his health let me look after; He well deserves the best your kitchen has, And he may drink it without harm. Come, draw your circle, speak your charm, And let him have a flowing glass. (The Witch, with strange gestures, draws a circle and places many curious things within it; meanwhile the glasses begin to tinkle, and the kettle to sound and make music. She brings a large book, puts the Cat-Apes into the circle, and makes them serve as a desk to lay the book on, and hold the torches. She winks to Faust to come near.) FAUST. (to MEPHISTOPHELES). Now say, what would she with this witchery? These antic gestures, this wild bedlam-stuff, This most insipid of all mummery, I know it well, I hate it well enough. MEPHISTOPHELES. Pshaw, nonsense! come give up your sermonizing, And learn to understand what a good joke is! Like other quacks, she plays her hocus-pocus; It gives the juice a virtue most surprising! (He obliges Faust to enter the circle.) (The Witch begins to declaim from the book with great emphasis.) Now be exact! Of one make ten, Then two subtract, And add three then, This makes thee rich. Four shalt thou bate, Of five and six, So says the witch, Make seven and eight, And all is done. And nine is one, And ten is none, This is the witch's-one-time-one! FAUST. Methinks the woman speaks as she were mad. MEPHISTOPHELES. O never fear, she is not yet half done. I know the volume well, the rest is quite as bad; I have lost many a precious hour thereon; For a plain contradiction still must be, To sages as to fools, an equal mystery. My friend, this practice is no novelty: In every time and place have men been found, By means of three and one, and one and three, Plain truth with wildest fables to confound. So prate and prattle they in all the schools; What man of sense would plague him with such fools? Men pin their faith to words, in sounds high sapience weening, Though words were surely made to have a meaning. THE WITCH. (goes on reading from the book.) The mighty power Of secret lore, For which vain mortals burrow; The simple mind The prize will find, Without or care or sorrow. FAUST. What bibble-babble pours she out before us? She makes my skull split with her brainless chatter. I feel as if I heard the ceaseless clatter Of thirty thousand idiots in a chorus. MEPHISTOPHELES. Enough, kind Sibyl; thanks for thy good will! Now bring your jug here, and the goblet fill With this prime juice, till it be brimming o'er. My friend here is a man of high degrees, And he may drink unscath'd what quantity you please; He has swill'd many a goodly draught before. (The Witch, with many ceremonies, pours the beverage into a cup. While Faust brings it to his mouth a light flame arises.) MEPHISTOPHELES. Come, quaff it boldly over, without thinking! The draught will make thy heart to burn with love. Art with the devil hand and glove, And from a fire-spurt would'st be shrinking? (The Witch looses the circle. Faust steps out.) MEPHISTOPHELES. Come, quickly out, you must not rest. THE WITCH. I hope the swig will wonders work on thee! MEPHISTOPHELES. And, if you have aught to request from me, You need but name it on Walpurgis' feast. THE WITCH. There is a song!—at times sung, you will find It hath a wondrous working on your mind. MEPHISTOPHELES. (to FAUST.) Come, for the present I must be the squire, And you for once submit to wear the bridle. You must keep quiet, and let yourself perspire, That through your inmost frame the potent juice may pierce. When we have time to spare, I shall rehearse Some lessons on the art of being nobly idle, And soon thy heart with ecstasy shall know, How Cupid 'gins to move, and boundeth to and fro. FAUST. (turning again towards the mirror.) Indulge me with one glance!—one moment spare! It was a virgin-form surpassing fair! MEPHISTOPHELES. No! No! with aid like mine thou soon shalt see The paragon of woman bodily. (Aside.) Anon, if this good potion does its duty, He'll see in every wench the Trojan beauty. SCENE IV. A Street. Faust. Margaret passes over. FAUST. My fair young lady, may I dare To offer you my escort home? MARGARET. I am no lady, nor am I fair, And need no guide to shew me home. FAUST. By heaven this child is passing fair! A lovelier girl ne'er met my view; Of such a modest gentle air, And yet a little snappish too. Her lips so red, her cheeks so bright, Forget I could not, if I might. How she casts down her lovely eyes, Deep-graven in my heart it lies, And how so sharp she turn'd the street, It is most ravishingly sweet! Enter Mephistopheles. FAUST. Hark! I must have that damsel instantly! MEPHISTOPHELES. Which one? FAUST. She that is just gone by. MEPHISTOPHELES. What! she? She's just come from confession. Where she received a full remission: I slinked close by the box, and heard The simple damsel's every word; 'Tis a most guileless thing, that goes For very nothing to the priest: My power does not extend to those. FAUST. Yet she is fourteen years of age at least. MEPHISTOPHELES. You speak like Jack the debauchee, Who thinks each sweet flow'r grows for me: As if his wish sufficed alone, To make each noblest prize his own. Yet 'tis not always done so easily. FAUST. My good Sir Knight of pedantry, Lay not thou down the law to me! And this, for good and all, be told, Unless, this very night, I hold The sweet young maid in my embrace— 'Tis the last time that you shall see my face. MEPHISTOPHELES. Bethink thee!—what with here, and what with there, The thing requires a little care. Full fourteen days must first be spent, To come upon the proper scent. FAUST. Had I but seven hours of rest, The Devil's aid I'd ne'er request, To do with this young creature as I list. MEPHISTOPHELES. You speak as if you were a Frenchman born; But though the end be good, we must not scorn The means; what boots the mere gratification? It is the best half of the recreation, When, up and down, and to and fro, The pretty doll, through every kind Of fiddle-faddle sweet flirtation, You knead out first, and dress up to your mind— As many an Italian tale can shew. FAUST. I need no tricks to whet my zest. MEPHISTOPHELES. Without abuse, and without jest, I tell thee flat, it is in vain To win the damsel by a coup de main. Storming is useless here; we must submit By stratagem and guile to master it. FAUST. Bring me some jewels of this treasure! The ground she treads on let me measure! A kerchief of her chaste attire! A garter of my heart's desire! MEPHISTOPHELES. That you may see how I would fain Do every thing to ease your pain, We shall not lose a single minute, I know her room—thou shalt enjoy thee in it. FAUST. And I shall see her?—have her? MEPHISTOPHELES. No! While she is at a neighbour's, thou Shalt free and unembarrassed go, And on the hope of joys that wait thee, Within her atmosphere shalt sate thee. FAUST. Can we go now? MEPHISTOPHELES. No we must wait till night. FAUST. Go fetch a present for my heart's delight. (Exit.) MEPHISTOPHELES. Presents already! good!—a lover should not loiter! I know some dainty spots of ground, Where hidden treasures may be found; I will straight go and reconnoitre. (Exit.) SCENE V. A small neat Chamber. MARGARET. (plaiting and putting up her hair.) I wonder who the gentleman could be, That on the street accosted me to-day! He looked a gallant cavalier and gay, And must be of a noble family. That I could read upon his brow— Else had he never been so free. (Exit.) Enter Faust and Mephistopheles. MEPHISTOPHELES. Come in—but softly—we are landed now! FAUST. (after a pause.) Leave me alone a minute, I entreat! MEPHISTOPHELES. (looking round about.) Not every maiden keeps her room so neat. (Exit.) FAUST. (looking round.) I welcome thee, thou sweetest twilight-shine! That dost this holy sanctuary pervade. O seize my heart, sweet pains of love divine, That on the languid dew of hope are fed! What placid bliss in this abode is found! What order, what contentment breathes around! Amid this poverty what riches dwell! What fulness teems within this narrow cell! (He throws himself on the old leathern arm-chair beside the bed.) Receive thou me! thou, who, in ages gone, In joy and grief hast welcomed sire and son. How often hath, on this paternal throne, A clambering host of playful children hung! Perhaps that here my lov'd one too hath clung Around her grandsire's neck, with childish joy Thankful received the yearly Christmas toy, And with the full red cheeks of childhood press'd Upon his withered hand a pious kiss. I feel, sweet maid, mine inmost soul possess'd By thy calm spirit of order and of bliss, That motherly doth teach thee day by day: That bids thee deck the table clean and neat, And crisps the very sand strewn at thy feet. Sweet hand! sweet, lovely hand! where thou dost sway, The meanest hut is deck'd in heaven's array. And here! (He lifts up the bed-curtain.) What impulse seizes me of wild delight! Here might I gaze unwearied day and night. Nature! in airy dreams here didst thou build The mortal tent of the angelic child; Here she reposed! her tender bosom teeming With warmest life, in buoyant fulness streaming, And here the bud of purest heavenly mould The blossoms of its beauty did unfold! And thou? what brought thee here? why now back-shrinks Thy courage from the prize it sought before? What wouldst thou have? thy heart within thee sinks; Poor wretched Faust! thou know'st thyself no more. Do I then breathe a magic atmosphere? I sought immediate enjoyment here, And into viewless dreams my passion flows! Are we the sport of every breath that blows? And came she now, and found me gazing here, How for my reckless boldness must I pay! The mighty man, how small would he appear, And at her feet, a suppliant, sink away! MEPHISTOPHELES. (coming back.) Quick! quick! I see her—she'll be here anon. FAUST. Yes, let's be gone! for once and all be gone! MEPHISTOPHELES. Here is a casket, of a goodly weight; Its former lord, I ween, bewails its fate. Come put it in the press. I swear She'll lose her senses, when she sees it here. The trinkets, that I stow'd within it Were bait meant for a nobler prey: But child is child, and play is play. FAUST. I know not—shall I? MEPHISTOPHELES. Can you doubt a minute? Would you then keep the dainty pelf, Like an old miser, to yourself? If so, I would advise you, sir, All further trouble me to spare, And better pastimes for yourself prepare Then looking lustfully at her. I scratch my head and rub my hands that you— (He puts the casket into the press and locks the door again.) Come let's away! With this sweet piece of womanhood may do, According as your heart's desire may say; And you stand there, And gape and stare, As if you looked into a lecture-room, And there the twin grey spectres saw, Physic and Metaphysica! Come! come!— (Exeunt.) (Enter Margaret, with a lamp.) MARGARET. It is so sultry here, so hot! (She opens the window.) And yet so warm without 'tis not. I feel—I know not how—oppress'd; Would to God that my mother came! A shivering cold runs o'er my frame— I am but a poor timid girl at best! (While taking off her clothes, she sings.) There was a king in Thule, True-hearted to his grave; To him his dying mistress A golden goblet gave. He prized it more than rubies; At every drinking-bout His eyes they swam in Heaven, When he did drink it out. And when he came to die, he Divided all his lands, But still the golden goblet He kept in his own hands. He sat amid his barons, And feasted merrily, Within his father's castle, That beetles o'er the sea. There stood the ancient toper, And drank his life's last glow, Then threw the goblet over Into the sea below. He saw it fall, and splashing Sink deep into the sea; His eyes they sank for ever, No bumper more drank he. (She opens the press to put in her clothes, and sees the casket.) How came the pretty casket here? no doubt I locked the press when I went out. 'Tis really strange!—Belike that it was sent A pledge for money that my mother lent. Here hangs the key; sure there can be no sin In only looking what may be within. What have we here? good heavens! see! What a display of finery! Here is a dress in which a queen Might on a gala-day be seen. I wonder how the necklace would suit me! Who may the lord of all this splendour be? (She puts on the necklace, and looks at herself in the glass.) Were but the ear-rings mine to wear! It gives one such a different air. What helps the beauty of the poor? 'Tis very beautiful to be sure, But without riches little weighs; They praise you, but half pity while they praise. Gold is the pole, Where points the whole, On gold all hangs. Alas we poor! SCENE VI. A Walk. Faust going up and down thoughtfully, then enter Mephistopheles. MEPHISTOPHELES. By all the pangs of love! by all the blasts of hell! Or any other curse, if curse there be more fell! FAUST. How now Mephisto? what the devil's wrong? I ne'er beheld a face one half so long! MEPHISTOPHELES. But that I am a devil myself, I'd sell Both soul and body on the spot to hell! FAUST. I verily believe you've lost your wits! Beseems it then Satanic dignity, To fall into such wild fantastic fits, Outrageous more than bedlamite may be? MEPHISTOPHELES. Only conceive! the box of rare gewgaws For Margaret got, is in a parson's claws! The thing came to the mother's sight, Who soon suspected all was not right: The woman has got a most delicate nose, That snuffling through the prayer-book goes, And seldom scents a thing in vain, If it be holy or profane; Your jewels, she was not long in guessing, Were not like to bring a blessing. My child, quoth she, ill-gotten gear Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood; We'll give it to Mary-mother dear, And she will feed us with heavenly food! Margaret look'd blank—'tis hard, thought she, To put a God-send away from me, And surely godless was he never Who lodg'd it in the press so clever. The mother then brought in the priest; He quickly understood the jest, And his eyes water'd at the sight. Good dame, quoth he, you have done right! The prize is his who wins the fight.— The Church is a most dainty lady, And her stomach holds good store, Has swallowed lands on lands already, And, still unglutted, craves for more; The Church alone, my ladies dear, Can digest ill-gotten gear. FAUST. That is a universal fashion—Jew. And King, and Kaiser have it too. MEPHISTOPHELES. Then ring and ear-ring, and necklace, and casket, Like a bundle of toad-stools away he bore; Thanked her no less, and thanked her no more, Than had it been so many nuts in a basket. On heavenly treasures then held an oration— Much, of course, to their edification. FAUST. And Margaret? MEPHISTOPHELES. Sits now in restless mood, Knows neither what she would, nor what she should, Thinks on the trinkets night and day, And on him who gave them, more. FAUST. Sweet love! her grief doth vex me sore. Mephisto, mark well what I say! Get her another set straightway! The first were not so very fine. MEPHISTOPHELES. O yes! with you all things are children's play! FAUST. And recollect that this affair is mine! Throw thee oft in her neighbour's way. Be not a devil of milk and water, And for another gift go cater. MEPHISTOPHELES. Yes, gracious sir! most humbly I obey. (Exit Faust.) MEPHISTOPHELES. (solus.) Such love-sick fools as these would blow Sun, moon, and stars, like vilest stuff, To nothing, with a single puff, To make their lady-love a show! SCENE VII. Martha's House. Martha alone. MARTHA. In honest truth, it was not nobly done, In my good spouse to leave me here alone! May God forgive him! while he roams at large, O'er the wide world, I live at my own charge. Sure he could have no reason to complain, So good a wife he'll not find soon again. (She weeps.) He may be dead!—Ah me!—could I but know, By a certificate, if it be so! Enter Margaret. MARGARET. Martha! MARTHA. What wouldst thou, dear? MARGARET. My knees can scarcely bear me!—only hear! I found a second box to-day Of ebon-wood, just where the first one lay, All full of jewels passing rare, And richer than the former were. MARTHA. You must not tell this to your mother— 'Twould fare no better than the other. MARGARET. Only come near, and see! look here! MARTHA. (decking her with the jewels.) Thou art a lucky little dear! MARGARET. And yet I dare not thus be seen In church, or on the public green. MARTHA. Come over here when thou hast time to spare, And deck thee with the jewels secretly; Then promenade an hour before the mirror there, It is a joy at least to thee and me. Then on a Sunday, on a holiday, Our riches by degrees we can display, A necklace first, the drops then in your ear; Your mother sees it not, and should she hear, 'Tis easy to invent some fair pretence or other. MARGARET. But whence the pretty caskets came? I fear There's something in it not right altogether. (knocking.) Good God!—I hear a step—is it my mother? MARTHA. (looking through the casement.) 'Tis a strange gentleman.—Come in! Enter Mephistopheles. MEPHISTOPHELES. I hope the ladies will not think me rude, That uninvited thus I here intrude. (Observing Margaret, he draws back respectfully.) I have commands for Mistress Martha Schwerdtlein! MARTHA. 'Tis here! what has the gentleman to say? MEPHISTOPHELES. (softly to her.) Excuse my freedom. I perceive that you Have visitors of rank to-day; For this time I shall bid adieu, And after dinner do myself the pleasure To wait upon you, when you're more at leisure. MARTHA. (aloud.) Think, child! of all things in the world the last! My Margaret for a lady should have pass'd! MARGARET. The gentleman is far too good; I am a simple girl—boast neither wealth nor blood. This dress, these jewels, are not mine. MEPHISTOPHELES. 'Tis not the dress alone that I admire, She has a mien, a gait, a look so fine, That speak the lady more than costliest attire. MARTHA. And now your business, sir? I much desire— MEPHISTOPHELES. I would I had a better tale to tell! Small thanks I should receive, I knew it well. Your man is dead—his compliments I bear. MARTHA. Is dead! the good fond soul! O woe! My man is dead! what shall I do? MARGARET. Beseech thee, dearest Martha, don't despair. MEPHISTOPHELES. Now hear my mournful story to the end. MARGARET. I would not love a man on earth, to rend Me thus with grief, when he should chance to die. MEPHISTOPHELES. Joy hath its sorrow, sorrow hath its joy; Twin sisters are they, as the proverb saith. MARTHA. Now let me hear the manner of his death. MEPHISTOPHELES. Where Padua's holy turrets rise, Above the grave of Antony, On consecrated ground he lies, And slumbers for eternity. MARTHA. No further message then he gave thee? MEPHISTOPHELES. Yes! one request, both great and heavy. For his soul's peace, your husband wanted Three hundred masses to be chanted! This is the whole of my commission. MARTHA. What! not a jewel? not a coin? No journeyman, however poor, However wild, could make such an omission; But in the bottom of his pouch is sure To keep some small memorial for his wife, And rather beg, and rather pine Away the remnant of his life— MEPHISTOPHELES. Madam! though I am loath, the truth must be confess'd, Your worthy husband had no gold to waste. His grievous errors he lamented sore— Yes! and bewailed his own mishap much more. MARGARET. Alas for all the miseries of mankind! He shall not want my oft-repeated prayer. MEPHISTOPHELES. Thou gentle heart dost well deserve to find A husband worthy of a prize so fair. MARGARET. Ah no!—for that, it is too soon. MEPHISTOPHELES. A lover then might in the mean time do. 'Tis bounteous Heaven's choicest boon To fondle in one's arm so sweet a thing as you. MARGARET. Such things are never done with us. MEPHISTOPHELES. Done or not done!—It may be managed thus:— MARTHA. Now let me hear! MEPHISTOPHELES. By his death-bed I stood. It was a little better than of dung, Of mouldy straw; there, as a Christian should, With many a sin repented on his tongue, He died.—Oh! how must I detest Myself, he said, my substance thus to waste, And my dear wife abandon so! It kills me with the simple memory, Oh that she might forgive me ere I die! MARTHA. (weeping.) Good soul! I have forgiven him long ago. MEPHISTOPHELES. (continuing his interrupted narrative.) And yet was she, God knows, much more to blame than I. MARTHA. What! did he lie?—on the grave's brink to lie! MEPHISTOPHELES. He fabled to the last, be sure, If I am half a connoisseur. In sooth, I had no time to gape, he said, First to get children, then to get them bread, To clothe them, and to put them to a trade, From toil and labour I had no release, And could not even eat my own small share in peace. MARTHA. Can it then be? has he forgotten quite My fag and drudgery, by day and night? MEPHISTOPHELES. Not quite! he thought on you, and kindly too. When last we sailed from Malta—so he said, For wife and children fervently I prayed, And Heaven a favourable gale then blew. We came across a Turkish ship that bore Home bullion, to increase the Sultan's store, And, with our wonted valour, we Gained a triumphant victory. The precious spoil was shared among the crew, And I received the part that was my due. MARTHA. But where and how?—has he then buried it? MEPHISTOPHELES. Who knows where the four winds have hurried it! A lady took him under her protection At Naples, as he wandered to and fro; She left him many a mark of her affection, As he to his life's end had cause to know. MARTHA. The knave to treat his helpless orphans so! To all our misery and all our need, Amid his reckless life he gave no heed! MEPHISTOPHELES. And, as you see, he suffers for it now. Were I in your place, mark what I would do; I'd mourn him one chaste year, and, at my leisure, I'd look about me for a second treasure. MARTHA. Alas! God knows it would be hard to find Another so completely to my mind. A better-hearted fool you never knew, A love of roving was his only vice; And foreign wine, and foreign women too, And the accursed gambling dice. MEPHISTOPHELES. Such marriage-articles were most convenient, Had he to you been only half so lenient. On terms like these myself had no objection, To change with you the ring of conjugal affection. MARTHA. The gentleman seems fond of pleasantry! MEPHISTOPHELES. (to himself.) Now I'll be off, for if I longer tarry here, 'Tis like she'd nail the devil himself to marry her! (To Margaret.) How stands it with your heart then?—is it free? MARGARET. I scarce know what you mean. MEPHISTOPHELES. Sweet guileless heart! Ladies, farewell! MARGARET. Farewell! MARTHA. One word before we part! I fain would have it solemnly averred, How my dear husband died, and where he was interred; A friend to order I have always been, His death must in the newspapers be seen. MEPHISTOPHELES. Yes, mistress! when two witnesses attest, As Scripture saith, the truth is manifest; I have a friend, who, at your requisition, Before the judge will make a deposition. I'll bring him here. MARTHA. Yes, bring him with you. MEPHISTOPHELES. And we shall meet your fair young lady too? (To Margaret.) A gallant youth!—has been abroad, and seen The world—a perfect cavalier, I trow. MARGARET. 'Twould make me blush, should he bestow A single look on one so mean. MEPHISTOPHELES. You have no cause to be asham'd before The proudest king, that ever sceptre bore. MARTHA. This evening we expect you in the garden. SCENE VIII. A Street. FAUST. How now? what news? how speed your labours? MEPHISTOPHELES. Bravo! 'tis well you are on fire, Soon shall you have your heart's desire. This evening you shall meet her at her neighbour's: A dame 'tis to a nicety made For the bawd and gipsey trade. FAUST. 'Tis well. MEPHISTOPHELES. But you must lend a hand, and so must I. FAUST. One good turn deserves another. MEPHISTOPHELES. We must appear before a judge together, And solemnly there testify, That stiff and stark her worthy spouse doth lie, Beside the shrine of holy Antony. FAUST. Most wise! we must first make a goodly travel! MEPHISTOPHELES. Sancta simplicitas! what stuff you drivel! We may make oath and not know much about it. FAUST. Hast thou no other plan?—'tis dished—I scout it. MEPHISTOPHELES. O holy man that would outwit the devil! Is it the first time in your life that you Have sworn to what you knew could not be true? Of God, the world, and all that it contains, Of man, and all that circles in his veins, Or dwells within the compass of his brains, Have you not pompous definitions given, With swelling breast and dogmatizing brow, As if you were an oracle from heaven? And yet, if to the bottom you would go, You knew as much of all these things, in faith, As now you know of Master Schwerdtlein's death! FAUST. Thou art, and wert, a sophist and a liar. MEPHISTOPHELES. Yes, unless one could mount a little higher. To-morrow I shall hear you pour False vows that silly girl before, Swear to do every thing to serve her, And love her with a quenchless fervour. FAUST. And from my heart too. MEPHISTOPHELES. Oh! of course, of course! Then will you speak, till you are hoarse, Of love, and constancy, and truth, And feelings of eternal youth— Will that too be the simple sooth? FAUST. It will! it will!—for when I feel, And for the feeling, the confusion Of feelings, that absorbs my mind, Seek for names, and none can find, Sweep through the universe's girth, For every highest word to give it birth; And then this soul-pervading flame, Infinite, endless, endless name, Call you this nought but devilish delusion? MEPHISTOPHELES. Still I am right! FAUST. Hold! mark me this! I prythee spare my lungs, for true it is— Who will be right, and only has a tongue, Is never wrong. Come, I confess thee master in debating, That I may be delivered from thy prating. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Martha's Garden. Margaret on Faust's arm, Martha with Mephistopheles walking up and down. MARGARET. I feel it well, 'tis from pure condescension You pay to one like me so much attention. With travellers 'tis a thing of course, To be contented with the best they find; For sure a man of cultivated mind Can have small pleasure in my poor discourse. FAUST. One look from thee, one word, delights me more Than all the world's vain boasted lore. (He kisses her hand.) MARGARET. O trouble not yourself! how could you kiss it so? It is so coarse, it is so rough! My mother makes me work and fag enough; With her must all things neat and trimly show. (They pass on.) MARTHA. And you, Sir, do you still intend to roam? MEPHISTOPHELES. Alas! that trade and duty make it so! With what sad hearts from many a place we go, Where we had almost learned to be at home! MARTHA. When one is young it seems a harmless gambol, Thus round and round through the wide world to ramble; But soon the evil day comes on, And as a stiff old bachelor to die Has never yet done good to any one. MEPHISTOPHELES. The distant danger trembling I descry. MARTHA. Then, Sir, take my advice, and ere it be too late, Seek to avoid such miserable fate. (They pass on.) MARGARET. Yes, from your speech, and from your eye, Native politeness seems to flow; But you have other friends enow, They are more sensible than I. FAUST. Their sense, sweet love, is often nothing more Than vain conceit of vain short-sighted lore. MARGARET. How mean you that? FAUST. Oh that simplicity and innocence Its own unvalued worth so seldom knows! That lowliness of heart, the highest boon That loving Nature's bounteous hand bestows! MARGARET. Canst thou afford a single thought on me, I shall have time enough to think on thee. FAUST. You are then much alone? MARGARET. Our household is but small, I own, And yet must be attended to. We keep no maid; I have the whole to do, Must wash and brush, and sew and knit, And cook, and early run and late; And then my mother is, in every whit, So accurate! Not that she feels herself at all confined. We might do more than many others do! My father left a goodly sum behind, With a neat house, and garden too, Before the gate. Yet have we liv'd retired enough of late; My brother chose the soldier's trade, My little sister dear is dead; Poor thing! it caus'd me many an hour of pain, But gladly would I suffer all again, So much I lov'd the child. FAUST. An angel, if like thee! MARGARET. I nursed it, and it loved me heartily. My father died before it saw the light, My mother was despaired of quite, So miserably weak she lay. Yet she recover'd slowly, day by day; And as she had not strength herself To suckle the poor helpless elf, She gave the charge to me, and I With milk and water nursed it carefully. Thus in my arm, and on my lap, it grew, And smil'd and play'd, and called me mother too. FAUST. This must have yielded thee the purest bliss. MARGARET. But many a day and night of heaviness. The infant's cradle stood beside my bed, And when it cried, or the least motion made, I must awake; Sometimes to give it drink, sometimes to take It with me to my bed, and fondle it: And when all this its fretting might not stay, I rose, and danced about, and dandled it, And washed it at the well, by break of day. I made the markets too, and kept house for my mother, One weary day just like another; Thus drudging on the heart may sometimes sink, But one can relish better meat and drink. (They pass on.) MARTHA. We women surely are much to be pitied; A hardened bachelor will seldom mend. MEPHISTOPHELES. A few apostles such as you are needed, From evil ways their thoughtless steps to bend. MARTHA. Speak plainly, Sir, have you found nothing yet? Are you quite disentangled from the net? MEPHISTOPHELES. A house and hearth, we have been often told, With a good wife, is worth its weight in gold. MARTHA. I mean, Sir, have you never felt the want? MEPHISTOPHELES. A good reception I have always found. MARTHA. I mean to say, did your heart never pant? MEPHISTOPHELES. For ladies my respect is too profound, To jest on such a serious theme as this. MARTHA. I see we still are at cross purposes. MEPHISTOPHELES. Alas, that I should be so blind! But one thing is not cross—for you are very kind! (They pass on.) FAUST. You knew me, then, you little angel, straight, When you beheld me at the garden-gate? MARGARET. Mark'd you it not?—You saw my downward look. FAUST. And you forgive the liberty I took, When, with a boldness more than meet, I ventur'd to address you on the street? MARGARET. I was surprised, I knew not what to say; No one could speak an evil word of me. Did he, perchance, in my comportment see Aught careless or improper, on that day, That he should take me for a worthless girl, Whom round his little finger he might twirl? Not yet the favourable thoughts I knew, That even then were rising here for you; One thing I know, myself I sharply chid, That I could treat you then no harsher than I did. FAUST. Sweet love! MARGARET. Let go! (She plucks a star-flower, and pulls the petals off one after another.) FAUST. What's that? a nosegay? shew it me. MARGARET. 'Tis but a game. FAUST. How so? MARGARET. Go! you would laugh at me. (She continues pulling the petals, and murmuring to herself.) FAUST. What are you murmuring now? MARGARET. (half loud.) He loves me, yes,—he loves me, no. FAUST. Thou sweet angelic face! MARGARET. (murmuring as before.) He loves, yes,—he loves me, no. (pulling out the last petal with manifest satisfaction.) He loves me, yes! FAUST. Yes, my child! let this language of the flowers Be as the judgment of the Gods to thee; He loves thee! know'st thou what it means?—He loves thee! (He seizes her by both hands.) MARGARET. I scarce can speak for joy! FAUST. Fear thee not, love! let mine eye's-look proclaim, This pressure of my hand, proclaim to thee What words can never tell: To yield us to an ecstasy of joy, And feel that this joy must eternal be! Eternal! yes! its end would be despair! It hath no end!—it cannot have an end! (Margaret presses his hands, makes herself free, and runs away. He stands still for a moment thoughtfully, then follows her.) MARTHA. (coming up.) 'Tis getting late. MEPHISTOPHELES. Yes, and we must away. MARTHA. I fain would have you stay; But 'tis an evil neighbourhood, Where idle gossips find their only good, Their pleasure and their business too, In spying out all that their neighbours do. And thus, the whole town in a moment knows The veriest trifle. But where is our young pair? MEPHISTOPHELES. Like wanton birds of summer, through the air I saw them dart away. MARTHA. He seems well pleased with her. MEPHISTOPHELES. And she with him. 'Tis thus the world goes. SCENE II. A Summer-house in the Garden. (Margaret comes springing in, and hides herself behind the door of the summer-house. She places the point of her finger on her lips, and looks through a rent.) MARGARET. He comes! FAUST. (coming up.) Thou cunning soul, thus trick'st me thou? I have thee now! (He kisses her.) MARGARET. (clasping him and returning the kiss.) Thou best of men, with my whole heart I love thee! (Mephistopheles heard knocking.) FAUST. (stamping.) Who's there? MEPHISTOPHELES. A friend! FAUST. A beast! MEPHISTOPHELES. 'Tis time now to remove thee. MARTHA. (coming up.) Yes, Sir, 'tis getting late. FAUST. May I not take you home? MARGARET. My mother would—farewell! FAUST. And must I leave you then? Farewell! MARTHA. Adieu! MARGARET. Right soon to meet again! (Exeunt Faust and Mephistopheles.) MARGARET. (alone.) Dear God! what such a man as this Can think on any theme you may! I stand ashamed, and answer yes To every word that he may say. I wonder what a man, so learned as he, Can find in a poor simple girl like me. (Exit.) SCENE III. Wood and Cavern. FAUST. (alone.) Spirit Supreme! thou gav'st me—gav'st me all, For which I asked thee. Not in vain hast thou Turned toward me thy countenance in fire. Thou gavest me wide Nature for my kingdom, And power to feel it, to enjoy it. Not Cold-wond'ring visit gav'st thou me alone, But ev'n into her bosom's depth to look, As it might be the bosom of a friend. The row of living things thou mad'st to pass Before mine eyes, my brethren mad'st me know In silent bush, in water, and in air. And when the storm loud blustereth, and raves Through the dark forest, and the giant pine, Down-tumbling, tears with it the neighbour-branches And neighbour-stems flat-strewn upon the ground, And to their fall the hollow mountain thunders; Then dost thou guide me to the cave, where safe I learn to know myself, and from my breast Deep and mysterious wonders are unfolded. Then mounteth the full moon unto my view With softening brightness; hovering before me, From rocky wall, from humid brake, arise The silver shapes of times by-gone, and soothe The painful pleasure of deep-brooding thought. Alas! that man enjoys no perfect bliss, I feel it now. Thou gav'st me with this joy, Which brings me near and nearer to the gods, A fellow, whom I cannot do without; Though, cold and heartless, he debases me Before myself, and, with a single breath, Blows all the bounties of thy love to nought. He fans within my breast a raging fire For that fair image, busy to do ill. Thus reel I from desire on to enjoyment, And in enjoyment languish for desire. Enter Mephistopheles. MEPHISTOPHELES. What! not yet tired of meditation? Methinks this is a sorry recreation. To try it once or twice might do; But then, again to something new. FAUST. You might employ your time some better way Than thus to plague me on a happy day. MEPHISTOPHELES. Well, well! I do not grudge you quiet, You need my aid, and you cannot deny it. There is not much to lose, I trow, With one so stiff, so harsh, so mad as thou. Toil! moil! from morn to ev'n so on it goes! And what one should, and what one should not do, One cannot always read it on your nose. FAUST. This is a tone for you most fit! Annoy me first, and then ask thanks for it. MEPHISTOPHELES. Poor son of Earth! without my tim'd assistance, How had'st thou ever dragged on thy existence? From freakish Fancy's fever'd effervescence I have work'd long ago your convalescence, And, but for me, you would have marched away, In your best youth, from the blest light of day. What have you here, in caves and clefts, to do, Like an old owl, screeching to-whit, to-whoo? Or, like a torpid toad, that sits alone Sipping the oozing moss and dripping stone? A precious condition to be in! I see the Doctor sticks yet in your skin. FAUST. Couldst thou but know what re-born vigour springs From this lone wandering in the wilderness, Couldst thou conceive what heavenly joy it brings, Then wert thou fiend enough to envy me my bliss. MEPHISTOPHELES. A supermundane bliss! In night and dew to lie upon the height, And clasp the heaven and earth in wild delight, To swell up to the godhead's size, And pierce, with more than mortal eyes, Down to the marrow of the earth! Within your single breast to feel the birth Of the Six-days' Creation, and to glow With proud anticipation of—I know Not what—in love and joy to overflow, Casting the paltry son of earth behind, And then, the heaven-sprung intuition (with a gesture.) To end—I shall not say in what—fruition. FAUST. Shame on thee! MEPHISTOPHELES. Yes! that's not quiet to your mind. You have a privilege to cry out shame, When things are mentioned by their proper name. Before chaste ears one may not dare to spout, What chastest hearts yet cannot do without. I do not envy you the pleasure Of palming lies upon yourself at leisure; But long it cannot last, I warrant thee. You are returned to your old whims, I see, And, at this rate, you soon will wear Your strength away, in madness and despair. Of this enough! thy love sits waiting thee, Without thee all seems troubled and confin'd. By day, by night, she has thee in her mind; I trow she loves thee mightily. Thy raging passion 'gan to flow, Like a torrent in Spring from melted snow; Into her heart thy tide gush'd high, Now is thy shallow streamlet dry. Instead of reigning monarch of the trees, Methinks the mighty gentleman might please, With some sweet words of comfort, to console This simple-hearted, love-tormented, soul. Poor thing, she is half dead of ennui, And at the window stands whole hours, to see The clouds pass by the old town-wall along. Were I a little bird! so goes her song The live-long day, and half the night to boot. Sometimes she will be merry, mostly sad, Now, like a child, weeping her sorrows out, Now calm again, in outward semblance glad; Always in love. FAUST. Thou snake! thou snake! MEPHISTOPHELES. (to himself.) So be it! that my guile thy stubborn will may break! FAUST. Hence and begone, thou Reprobate! Name not the lovely maid again! Bring the desire for her most sweet possession No more before my poor bewildered brain! MEPHISTOPHELES. What then? she deems that you are gone for ever; And half and half methinks you are. FAUST. No! I am nigh, and were I ne'er so far, I could forget her, I could lose her never; I envy ev'n the body of the Lord, When her lips touch it at the holy board. MEPHISTOPHELES. Yes! I have often envied thee myself For the twin pair that pastures among roses. FAUST. Avaunt, thou pimp! MEPHISTOPHELES. Rail you, and laugh will I. The God who made the male and female stuff, Himself, the noblest trade, knew well enough, How to shape out an opportunity. But come, why peak and pine you here? I lead you to the chamber of your dear, Not to the gallows. FAUST. Ah! what were Heaven's supremest blessedness Within her arms, upon her breast, to me! Must I not still be wrung with sympathy, That I must plunge her into such distress? I, the poor fugitive! without a home! The stranger to my kind! from place to place, Aimless and restless, ever doomed to roam! Who, like a waterfall, from rock to rock came roaring, With greedy rage into the abyss pouring; While she, a reckless infant, rears Sidewards her hut upon the Alpine field, And all her hopes, and all her fears, Within this little world concealed. And I—the God-detested—not alone Must bear the rocks with my wild torrent down, And shatter them to dust, but undermine Her and her peace in common wreck with mine! And such an offering, Hell, must it be thine? Help, Devil, to cut short the hour of ill! What happen must, may happen when it will! May her sad fate my crashing fall attend, And she with me be ruined in the end! MEPHISTOPHELES. Lo! how it boils and glows again! Go in, and comfort her, thou fool! Where a dilemma thwarts your hasty brain, You straight begin to mewl and pule, As if all further striving were in vain. What has a man to do with doubts and fears? In other points you are not ill spiced with the Devil. Nothing more silly lives on earth's wide level Than is a devil who despairs. SCENE IV. Margaret's Room. Margaret alone, at a Spinning-wheel. MARGARET. My rest is gone, My heart is sore; Peace find I never, And never more. Where he is not Life is the tomb, The world is bitterness And gloom. Crazed is my poor Distracted brain, My thread of thought Is rent in twain. My rest is gone, My heart is sore; Peace find I never, And never more. I look at the window For none but him, I go abroad For only him. His noble gait, His stature high, The smile of his mouth, The might of his eye, And, when he speaks, What flow of bliss! The squeeze of his hand, And ah! his kiss! My rest is gone, My heart is sore; Peace find I never, And never more. My bosom swells, And pants for him. O that I might clasp him, And hold on him! And kiss him, and kiss him The live long day, And on his kisses Melt away! SCENE V. Martha's Garden. Margaret and Faust. MARGARET. Promise me, Henry! FAUST. What I can. MARGARET. Now come! of your religion let me hear; I know thou art a most kind-hearted man, But as to thy belief I rather fear— FAUST. Leave that, my child! thou know'st how much I love thee; I'd give my last life's blood to serve thy need, No man on earth can charge me with the wish To rob him of his church, or of his creed. MARGARET. That's not enough; you must believe it too! FAUST. Must I? MARGARET. Alas! that I might work some change on you! Not even the holy mass do you revere. FAUST. I do revere it. MARGARET. Yes, but without desire. At mass and at confession, too, I fear, Thou hast not shewn thyself this many a year. Dost thou believe on God? FAUST. My love, who dares aspire To say he doth believe on God? May'st ask thy priests and sages all, Their answer seems like mockery to fall Upon the asker's ear. MARGARET. Then thou dost not believe? FAUST. Misunderstand me not, thou sweetest face! Who dares pronounce his name? And who confess— I do believe in Him? What heart hath felt him? And who dares presume To say—I do believe Him not? The All-embracer, The All-upholder, Grasps and upholds He not Thee, me, Himself? Doth not the Heaven vault itself above thee? Stands not the Earth's foundations firm beneath thee? And climb not, friendly looking down, Up Heaven's slope th'eternal stars? Gaze not our eyes into each other? And feel'st thou not an innate force propelling Thy tide of life to head and heart, A power that, in eternal mystery dwelling, Moves visibly invisible beside thee? Go fill thy heart therewith, in all its greatness, And when thy soul exulteth in this feeling, Then call it what thou wilt, Heart! Happiness! Love! God! I have no name by which I might denote it! Feeling is all in all: Name is but smoke and sound, Enshrouding heaven's glow. MARGARET. All that appears most pious and profound; Much of the same our parson says, Only he clothes it in a different phrase. FAUST. All places speak it forth, All hearts, from furthest South to furthest North, Proclaim the tale divine, Each in its proper speech; Wherefore not I in mine? MARGARET. When thus you speak it does not seem so bad, And yet is your condition still most sad: Unless you are a Christian all is vain. FAUST. Sweet love! MARGARET. Henry, it gives me pain, And long hath given me, that I should see The man I love so in such company. FAUST. How so? MARGARET. The man, whom thou hast made thy mate, Deep in my inmost soul I hate; Nothing in all my life hath made me smart So much as his disgusting leer. His face stabs like a dagger through my heart! FAUST. Sweet doll! thou hast no cause to fear. MARGARET. It makes my blood to freeze when he comes near. I have a kindly feeling for most men, But as to see thy face I long, So shrink I back from him with instinct pain. I hold him for a thorough knave to boot! May God forgive me if I do him wrong! FAUST. Such owls one cannot always do without. MARGARET. With men like him I would have nought to do! As often as he shews him here, He looks in at the door with such a scornful leer, Half angry too; 'Tis plain he feels no sympathy at all With any thing that breathes, and one can see It written on his forehead legibly, He never yet hath lov'd a single soul. Within thy arm I feel so free, So warm, so yielded up to thee, But his approach ties up my inmost soul. FAUST. O thou prophetic angel! MARGARET. This overpowers me so, That, when his icy foot doth cross the door, I feel as if I could not love thee more. When he is here, too, I could never pray, And this consumes my very heart away: Speak, Henry, is it not the same with thee? FAUST. Nay, thou indulgest an antipathy! MARGARET. I must be gone. FAUST. Oh! may it never be That I may spend one quiet hour with thee, One single little hour, and breast on breast, And soul on soul, with panting love, be press'd? MARGARET. Alas! did I but sleep alone! I'd leave the door unbarr'd this very night; But my good mother sleeps so soundly not, And overheard she our delight, Then were I dead upon the spot. FAUST. Sweet angel, that need little trouble you. There is a juice, whose soothing power can steep Her senses in a slumber soft and deep; Three drops mixed with her evening draught will do. MARGARET. I would adventure this and more for you. Of course, there's nothing hurtful in the phial? FAUST. If so, would I advise the trial? MARGARET. Thou best of men, thy very look can sway me, With strange resistless impulse to obey thee; So much already have I done for thee That to refuse thee now would be in vain. (Exit. Enter Mephistopheles. MEPHISTOPHELES. Well, is the monkey gone? FAUST. Hast play'd the spy again? MEPHISTOPHELES. I have been duly advertised, How Doctor Faust was catechised: I hope that it will profit you. The girls are wont—they have their reasons too— To see that one, in every point, believes The faith, that from his fathers he receives. They think, if little mettle here he shews, We too may lead him by the nose. FAUST. Thou monster, dost not know how this fond soul, To whom her faith is all, And who believes That none but such a faith salvation gives, With many an anxious holy fear is toss'd, Lest he, whom best she loves, should be for ever lost? MEPHISTOPHELES. Thou super sensual sensual fool, A silly girl takes thee to school. FAUST. Thou dirt and fire-born monster, thou! MEPHISTOPHELES. And then her skill in physiognomy, I must confess, it did astonish me! When I come near, she feels she knows not how, And, through my mask, can read it on my brow, That I must be, if not the very devil, A genius far above the common level. And now to-night— FAUST. What's that to thee? MEPHISTOPHELES. I have my joy too in my master's glee. SCENE VI. At the Well. Margaret and Eliza, with water-pitchers. ELIZA. Have you heard nought of Barbara? MARGARET. Nothing at all. I seldom stray From home, to hear what people say. ELIZA. You may believe me every whit; Sibylla told it me to-day. She too has been befooled: that comes of it When people give themselves such airs! MARGARET. How so? ELIZA. 'Tis rank! She eats and drinks not for herself alone. MARGARET. Poor girl! ELIZA. Well, well! she has herself to thank. How long did she not hang upon The fellow!—Yes! that was a parading, A dancing and a promenading! Must always be before the rest! And to wines and pasties be press'd; Began then to be proud of her beauty, And was so reckless of her duty As to take presents from him too. That was a cooing and a caressing! No wonder if the flow'r too be a-missing! MARGARET. I pity her. ELIZA. Methinks you have not much to do. When we were not allowed to venture o'er The threshold, night and day kept close at spinning, There stood she, with her paramour, Upon the bench, before the door, Or in the lane, and hour for hour Scarce knew the end from the beginning. 'Tis time she should submit to rule And penance do on the repentance-stool! MARGARET. But he will take her for his wife. ELIZA. He marry her! not for his life! An active youth like him can find, Where'er he pleases, quarters to his mind. Besides he's gone! MARGARET. That was not fair. ELIZA. And comes he back, she'll not enjoy him more. Her marriage wreath the boys will tear, And we will strew chopped straw before the door. (Exit.) MARGARET. (going homewards.) How could I once so boldly chide When a poor maiden stept aside! And scarce found words enough to name The measure of another's shame! It seemed so black, yet blackened I it more, And when it blackest was, I'd have it blacker still, And blessed my fate, and with proud thoughts did swell, And now myself am what I chid before!— Yet was each step that lured my slippery feet So good, so lovely, so enticing sweet! SCENE VII. An enclosed Area. (In a niche of the wall an image of the Mater dolorosa, with flower-jugs before it.) MARGARET. (placing fresh flowers in the jugs.) O mother rich in sorrows, Bend down to hear my cry! O bend thee, gracious mother, To soothe mine agony! Thy heart with swords is pierced, And tears are in thine eye, Because they made thy dear Son, A cruel death to die. Thou lookest up to heaven, And deeply thou dost sigh; His God and thine beholds thee, And soothes thine agony. Oh! who can know, What bitter woe Doth pierce me through and through? The fear, the anguish of my heart, Its every pang, its every smart, Know'st thou, and only thou. And wheresoe'er I wend me, What woes, what woes attend me, And how my bosom quakes! And when alone I find me, With weeping, weeping, weeping, My heart for sorrow breaks. These flowers, I pluck'd this morrow For thee, at break of day, I dew'd with tears of sorrow, O wipe them thou away! And ere the morn's first sunbeam Into my room was shed, I sat, in deepest anguish, And watch'd it on my bed. O save me, Mother of Sorrows! Unto my prayer give heed, By all the wounds that pierce thee, O save me in my need! SCENE VIII. Night. Street before Margaret's door. Enter Valentine. When I sat with our merry men, At a carousal, now and then, Where one may be allowed a boast, And my messmates gave toast for toast To the girl they prized the most, And with a bumper then swill'd o'er Their praise, when they could praise no more; I'd sit at ease, and lean upon My elbow, while they prated on, Till all the swaggerers had done, And smile and stroke my beard, and fill The goodly rummer to my hand, And say, All that is very well! But is there one, in all the land, That with my Margaret may compare, Or even tie the shoe to her? Rap, rap! cling, clang! so went it round! Each one a flowing bumper takes, And bawls aloud, Yes, she's the one, Sir! Her match is no where to be found, A very pattern to the sex! And the braggarts had nothing to answer. And now,—the devil's in the matter! It is enough to make one clatter, Like a rat, along the walls! With gibes and jeers shall each one taunt me? Each meanest villain now affront me? And every pettiest word that falls Me, like a purseless debtor, torture? And though I bruised them in a mortar, I could not say that they were wrong. What comes apace?—what creeps along? There is a pair comes slinking in. Is it the man whom I suppose? I'll seize him, instant, by the skin: Not living from the spot he goes! (Retires.) Enter Faust and Mephistopheles. FAUST. As, from the window of the vestry there, The light of the eternal lamp doth glare, And sidewards gleameth, dimmer still and dimmer, Till darkness closes round its fitful glimmer! So murky is it in my soul. MEPHISTOPHELES. And I feel faintish, like a kitten Upon a weary winter day, Beside the smoky fire-place sitting, And shrinking from the cold away. Yet am I in most virtuous trim, For a small trick at stealing, or at lechery; So jumps already through my every limb Walpurgis-Night, with all its glorious witchery. The day after to-morrow comes again The feast, with fun and frolic in its train. FAUST. Is it not time that you were raising The treasure there in the distance blazing? MEPHISTOPHELES. Soon shall you sate your eyes with gazing, And lift up from the urn yourself A little mine of precious pelf. I gave it a side-glance before— Saw lion-dollars by the score. FAUST. Is there no gaud?—no jewel at all? To deck my sweet little mistress withal. MEPHISTOPHELES. O yes! I saw some trinkets for the girls,— A sort of necklace strung with pearls. FAUST. 'Tis well that we have this to give her, For empty-handed go I never. MEPHISTOPHELES. And yet a wise man ought to learn To enjoy gratis, as well as to earn, Now, that the stars are bright and the sky clear, A piece of genuine music you shall hear; A moral song—that, while we seem to school her, With the more certainty we may befool her. (Sings to the guitar.) Why stands before Her lover's door, Young Cath'rine here, At early break of day? Beware, beware! He lets thee in, A maiden in, A maiden not away! When full it blows, He breaks the rose, And leaves thee then, A wretched outcast thing! Take warning, then, And yield to none But who hath shewn, And changed with thee the ring. VALENTIN. (advancing.) Ho, Serenaders! by the Element! You whoreson rascals! you rat-catchers, you! First, to the devil with the instrument, And, after it, the harper too! MEPHISTOPHELES. My good guitar is broken past redemption! VALENTIN. And your skull, too, anon; come, boy, attention! MEPHISTOPHELES. Quick, Doctor! here's no time to tarry! Keep close, as I shall lead the way. Out with your goosewing! A cant word for a sword. out, I say! Make you the thrusts, and let me parry. VALENTIN. Then parry that! MEPHISTOPHELES. Why not? VALENTIN. And that! MEPHISTOPHELES. Of course! VALENTIN. I believe the devil is here, or something worse. Good God! what's this?—my arm is lamed! MEPHISTOPHELES. (to FAUST.) Have at him there! VALENTIN. (falls.) O woe! MEPHISTOPHELES. Now is the lubber tam'd! But let's begone! why stand you gaping there? They'll raise a hue and cry here in a trice. I can shift pretty well with the police, But blood spilt is a dangerous affair. MARTHA. (at the window.) Ho! murder, ho! MARGARET. (at the window.) A light! a light! MARTHA. (as above.) They bawl, they brawl, they strike, they fight. THE PEOPLE. And here lies one already dead! MARTHA. (appearing below.) Where are the murderers? are they fled? GRETCHEN. (below.) Who's this lies here? THE PEOPLE. Thy mother's son. MARGARET. Almighty God! my brother dead! VALENTIN. I die! I die!—'tis quickly said, And yet more quickly done. Why stand you, women, and weep and wail? Draw near, and listen to my tale! (They all come round him.) My Margaret, mark me, you are young, And in sense not overstrong, You manage matters ill. I tell thee in thine ear, that thou Art, once for all, a strumpet,—Now Mayst go and take thy fill. MARGARET. My brother! God! what do you mean? VALENTIN. Leave the Lord God out of the jest; Said is said, and done is done; Now you may manage, as you best Know how to help the matter on. You commenced the trade with one, We shall have two, three, four, anon, Next a dozen, and next a score, And then the whole town at your door. When sin is born it shuns the light, (For conscience guilt may not abide it) And they draw the veil of night Over head and ears, to hide it; Yea, they would murder it, if they might. But anon it waxes bolder, And walks about in broad day-light, And, uglier still as it grows older; The less it offers to invite The more it courts the public sight. Ev'n now, methinks, I see the day, When every honest citizen, As from a corpse of tainted clay, From thee, thou whore! will shrink away. Thy very heart shall fail thee then, When they shall look thee in the face! No more shall golden chain thee grace! The Church shall spurn thee from its door! The altar shall not own thee more! Nor longer, with thy spruce lace-tippet, Where the dance wheels, shalt thou trip it! Some wretched hovel shalt thou live in, With beggars and cripples for company; And if above thou art forgiven, On earth thou shalt accursed be! MARTHA. Commend thy parting soul to heaven! Would'st thou add blasphemy to sin? VALENTIN. Could I but reach thy withered skin, Thou hag, thou vile and shameless bawd! For such a deed might well be had Forgiveness rich of every sin. MARGARET. Brother, thou mak'st me feel a hell of pain! VALENTIN. I tell thee, all thy tears are vain! Thou pierced'st me, ev'n to the heart, When with thy honour thou didst part. I go through death, with fearless mood, To meet my God, as a soldier should. (Dies.) SCENE IX. A Cathedral. Mass, Organ, and Song. Margaret amid a crowd of people, Evil-Spirit behind her. EVIL-SPIRIT. How different, Margaret, was thy case, When, guiltless yet of trespass, thou didst kneel Before the altar, And, from the well-worn book, Didst lisp thy prayers, Half childish play, Half God in thy heart! Margaret! Where is thy head? Within thy heart What dire misdeed! Prayest thou for thy mother's soul, whom thou Didst make to sleep a sleep of long, long woe? Whose blood is on thy threshold? —And, underneath thy heart, Moves not the swelling germ of life already, And, with its boding presence, Thee tortures, and itself? MARGARET. Woe, woe! That I might shake away the thoughts, That hither flit and thither, Against me! QUIRE. Dies iræ, dies illa, Solvet saeclum in favilla. (The organ sounds.) EVIL-SPIRIT. Terror doth seize thee! The trumpet sounds! The graves do quake! And thy heart, From its rest of ashes, To fiery pain Created again, Quivers to life! MARGARET. Would I were hence! I feel as if the organ stopped My breath of life, And, at the song, My inmost heart Melted away. QUIRE. Judex ergo cum sedebit, Quidquid latet adparebit, Nil inultum remanebit. MARGARET. I feel so straiten'd! The pillar-shafts Enclasp me round! The vault above Closes upon me!—Air! EVIL-SPIRIT. Conceal thee!—Sin and shame Are not concealed. Air! Light! Woe on thee! woe! QUIRE. Quid sum miser tunc dicturus? Quem patronum rogaturus? Cum vix justus sit securus. EVIL-SPIRIT. Their looks from thee bend The blessed away, And the pure shudder To reach thee the hand. Woe! MARGARET. Neighbour, your smelling-bottle! (She falls down in a swoon.) END OF ACT THE FOURTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Walpurgis-Night. The Hartz Mountains. Neighbourhood of Schirke and Elend. Faust and Mephistopheles. MEPHISTOPHELES. I would we had a broomstick to bestride; Upon the wildest goat I'd rather ride, Than trail me onward at a pace so slow. FAUST. So long as I upon my legs can go, This knotted stick will serve my end. What boots it to cut short the mountain path? Through the long labyrinth of vales to wend, These rugged mountain-steeps to climb, And hear the gushing waters' ceaseless chime, This is the seasoning such a journey hath! The Spring is waving in the birchen bower, And ev'n the pine begins to feel its power; Shall we alone be strangers to its sway? MEPHISTOPHELES. I can feel nothing o'the month of May, But am most wintry cold in every limb; I'd sooner travel over frost and snow. How sadly mounts th'imperfect moon!—so dim Shines forth its red disk, with belated glow, We run the risk, at every step we take, On stones, or trunks of trees, our legs to break! You must allow me to request the aid Of a Will-o-the-Wisp;—I see one right ahead, And in the bog it blazes merrily. Holla! my good friend! dare I be so free, Two travellers here stand much in need of thee; Why should'st thou waste thy flickering flame in vain? Pray be so good as light us up the hill! WILL-O-THE-WISP. Out of respect to you, I shall restrain, If possible, my ever-changing will; Though 'tis our natural temper, as you know, No other than a zig-zag course to go. MEPHISTOPHELES. Ha! ha! hast learn'd from men how to declaim? March on, I tell thee, in the Devil's name! Else will I blow thy flickering life-spark out. WILL-O-THE-WISP. You are the master of the house, no doubt, And therefore I obey you cheerfully. Only remember! 'tis the first of May, The Brocken is as mad as mad can be, And when an ignis-fatuus leads the way, You have yourselves to blame, if you should stray. FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES, and WILL-O-THE-WISP, in reciprocal song. Through the fairy realm of dreams, Where all the air with magic teems, Guide us onward merrily, And the praise shall be to thee! Guide us quick, and guide us sure, To the wide waste Brocken moor. Trees on trees how quick they rise, And how quick fleet from our eyes! Cliffs on cliffs, how bend they o'er The narrow passes we explore! And each rock, from jagged nose, How it snorts and how it blows! Over turf and over stone, Hasten stream and streamlet down. Is it rustling?—is it song? Love's sweet plaint that floats along? Voices of those days of bliss, Love, and hope, and joy, is this? And the echo, like the sounds Of ancient story, back rebounds. Oohoo! Shooho! what a fray! Owl, and pewet, and the jay, Are they all awake to-day? See we Salamanders' glow Through the bushy thicket go, With bellies thick, and legs so long? And the roots, our feet among, With serpent-foldings wind along, From the rocks, and from the sand, Twisting strange fantastic band, To frighten and entangle us; From their living lusty veins, Spread they forth their fibrous chains, Like the arms o'the polypus, 'Gainst the wand'rer. And the mice, Thousand-colour'd, numberless, Through the moss and heath disport! And the fire-flies' sparkling glow Shoots, in many a thronging row, To complete the wild escort. But whether are we standing, say, Or are we making further way? All things seem to change their places, Rocks and trees to make grimaces, And the lights, in witchy row, Twinkle more, and more they blow. MEPHISTOPHELES. Hold me tightly by the cue! From this hillock, may we view, At leisure, with admiring gaze, How Mammon in the mount doth blaze. FAUST. How strangely through the glens is spread, Dim sheen as of the morning's red! Ev'n to the clefts that deepest are, Of the dark abyss doth it glare. Here mounts the smoke, there rolls the steam, There flames through the white vapours gleam, Now slinking like a thread's thin frame, Now gushing in a fount of flame, Here stretching out, in many a rood, Along the vale, its veined flood, And here at once it checks its flight, And bursts in globes of studded light. There sparks are showering on the ground, Like golden sand besprinkled round, And lo! where all the rocky height, From head to foot, is bathed in light. MEPHISTOPHELES. Hath not old Mammon nobly lit His palace for the first of May? 'Tis well that thou hast come to it, One cannot see such doings every day. Ev'n now I hear the troop of noisy guests That to this merry banquet hastes. FAUST. How roars through the dark night the savage blast! How buffets it my neck, with noisy whiz! MEPHISTOPHELES. By the old mountain's rocky ribs hold fast! Or you will tumble down the precipice. The night is overcast with clouds. Hear how the storm is crashing through the woods! How the frighten'd owlets flit! How the massive pillars split Of the dark pine-palaces! How the branches creak and break! How the riven stems are groaning! How the gaping roots are moaning! In terrible confusion all, One on another clashing, they fall. And through the clefts, where their wrecks are buried, Hissing and howling the winds are hurried. Sounds of voices dost thou hear? Voices far, and voices near? And, all the mountain side along, Streams a raving magic song. WITCHES in chorus. The witches to the Brocken gallop, The stubble is yellow, the corn is green; A merry crew to a merry scene, And Urian, he leads us all up. A VOICE. Old mother Baubo comes alone, A mother-sow she rides upon. CHORUS. Honour to him, to whom honour is due! Lady Baubo leads us on! A mother-sow she rides upon, Behind her comes a goodly crew. A VOICE. Sister, which way came you? A VOICE. By Ilsenstone! An owlet's nest I looked into. With its two eyes it gloated so! A VOICE. The deuce! at what a pace you go! A VOICE. It tore me, it flay'd me! These red wounds it made me! WITCHES in chorus. The road is broad, the road is long, Why crowd you so on one another? Scrapes the besom, pricks the prong, Chokes the child, and bursts the mother. WIZARDS. (half chorus.) We trail us on, like snails, so slow, And all the women before us dart; For, to the Devil when we go, The women always get the start. SECOND HALF. Not quite so bad, we deem, the case is, The woman needs a thousand paces; But haste she, what she hasten can, With one spring comes up the man. VOICE. (from above.) Come up! come up from the lake below! VOICES. (from below.) Right gladly would we upwards soar; We wash us here till we are bleach'd like snow, But are as barren as before. BOTH CHORUSES. The wind is still, the stars are gone, The moon is pale so bright that shone, The magic crew, with whizzing sound, Sputters sparks on sparks around. VOICE. (from below.) Stop, stop! VOICE. (from above.) Who bawls so loud from the cleft below? VOICE. (from below.) Let me go with you! let me go! These hundred years I've grop'd my way, Up the sides of the mountain grey, Yet can I never reach the top. I fain would be a merry guest, At Satan's banquet with the rest. BOTH CHORUSES. On broomstick, and on lusty goat, On pitchfork, and on stick, we float; And he, to day who cannot soar, Is a lost man for evermore. HALF-WITCH. (below.) I hobble on behind them all, The others scarcely hear my call! I find no rest, when I'm at home, No rest I find when here I come. CHORUS OF WITCHES. The ointment gives our sinews might, For us each rag is sail enough, We find a ship in every trough, Whoso will fly must fly to night. BOTH CHORUSES. While we upon the summit ride, Be yours to sweep along the side, And with your swarms like locusts pour Far and wide across the moor. (They alight.) MEPHISTOPHELES. What a thronging, and jolting, and rolling, and rattling! What a whizzing, and whirling, and hurling, and prattling! What a sparkling, and blazing, and stinking, and burning! And witches that all topsy-turvy are turning!— Hold fast by me, or I shall lose you quite, Where are you? FAUST. (at a distance.) Here! MEPHISTOPHELES. What! so far in the rear! Why then 'tis time that I should use my right. Make way! Squire Voland comes, sweet mob, make way! Here, Doctor, hold by me!—and now, I say, It seems advisable we should get out, With one bold spring, from this wild rout; It is too mad even for such as I. See'st thou that strange blue light that twinkles nigh, With mighty power allures it me. Let us step in behind the bush, to see. FAUST. Strange son of contradiction!—may'st ev'n guide us! In verity 'twas a device most sage; To Blocksberg wander we a weary pilgrimage, Like hermits in a corner here to hide us. MEPHISTOPHELES. Lo! where the flames arise with bickering glee; In sooth it is a goodly company. In such a place one cannot be alone. FAUST. And yet I'd rather be upon The top where I behold the flame and smoke. There thousands to the Evil Spirit flock; And many a riddle there he will unlock. MEPHISTOPHELES. And many a riddle too, perchance, will lock. Let the great world rant and riot, We will house us here in quiet. It is a custom practised long by all, In the great world to make small. There see I young plump witches without cover, And old ones prudently veil'd over. Yield but to me, and I can promise thee, With little labour, mickle glee. I hear their noisy instruments begin! Confound their scraping!—one must bear the din. Come, come! what must be must be—let's go in, With my good introduction on this night, Thou shalt have laughter to thy heart's delight. What say'st thou, friend? this is no common show, A hundred lights are burning in a row, Extending farther than the eye can go; They dance, they talk, they cook, they drink, they court, Now tell me, saw you ever better sport? FAUST. Intend you, at our introduction here, As devil or magician to appear? MEPHISTOPHELES. Although 'tis much my wont to go incognito, Yet on a gala-day my order I may shew; And though a garter here is but of small avail, The famous horse's foot I ne'er yet knew to fail. See even now that cautious creeping snail! With her long feeling visage, she Has smelt out something of hell in me. Do what I may, here they discover me. Come, come! from fire to fire we ramble over, I am the pimp, and thou shalt be the lover. (To some who are sitting round a glimmering coal-fire.) Why sit ye moping here, old sirs?—in sooth, I cannot much approve your choice; I should prefer to see you mid the noise And hurly-burly merriment of youth. One does not come abroad to sit alone. GENERAL. Who would rely upon the faith of nations! They leave you thankless when their work is done; The people, like the women, pour libations Only in honour of the rising sun. MINISTER. The liberties these modern changes bring, I must confess I cannot praise; The good old times, when we were every thing, These were the truly golden days. PARVENU. We too had eyes for interests of our own, And ofttimes did, what we should not have done; But now all things are turning upside down, Just when we thought that all was won. AUTHOR. No person cares to read i'the present day, A book that has a word of common sense! And all our glib-tongued younkers, what are they, But bundles of conceit and impudence? MEPHISTOPHELES. (who all at once appears very old.) I find the people here for doom's-day ready, Now that the Brocken's top, for the last time, I've gain'd; And since my vessel now runs rather muddy, The world seems likewise almost drained. PEDLAR-WITCH. Good sirs, I pray you pass not by, But cast upon my wares an eye! Of trinkets such a rich display, One cannot meet with every day. Yet is there nothing in my store, Which far all other stores excels, That hath not done some mischief sore To earth, and all on earth that dwells; No dagger by which blood hath not been shed, No cup from which, through sound and healthy life, Corroding fiery juice hath not been spread, No gaud but hath seduced some lovely wife, No sword that hath not made a truce miscarry, Or stabbed behind the back its adversary. MEPHISTOPHELES. Good lady cousin! you come rather late. Your wares, believe me, are quite out of date; With novel times, one must have novelties, And novelties alone attract our eyes. FAUST. This is a fair that beats the Leipzig hollow! My head is so confused, I scarce can follow. MEPHISTOPHELES. To the top the stream is rushing, And we are pushed, when we think we are pushing. FAUST. Who, then, is that? MEPHISTOPHELES. Look at her well. 'Tis Lilith. FAUST. Who? MEPHISTOPHELES. Adam's first wife. Do thou beware thee of her glossy hair, Those locks with which she outshines all the train. Can she with them some thoughtless youth ensnare, It may be long ere he come back again. FAUST. There sit an old and young one on the sward; They seem to have been dancing somewhat hard. MEPHISTOPHELES. O! once begun, they'll go on like the devil. Come, come! they rise again—let's join the revel. (Faust and Mephistopheles join the dance; the former with the Young Witch as his partner, the latter with the Old one While dancing, they sing each a stanza of four lines; but these verses being as little remarkable for wit as for delicacy, are supposed to have been written by Goethe when in a dream, or in a state of magnetic sleep, and are, for this reason, omitted by the translator..) PROCKTOPHANTASMIST. (to the dancers.) Listen to order, you presumptuous brood! Have we not proved beyond disputing, That ghosts on terra firma have no footing? And yet you dance like any flesh and blood! THE YOUNG WITCH. (dancing.) What wants he here, that rude-like fellow there? FAUST. (dancing.) O, he is every where! What others dance 'tis his to prize. Each step he cannot criticise, He counts it for no step at all. But it offends him most of all, When he perceives us forwards go; If we would wheel us round in circles still, As he is wont to do in his old mill, He would not take it half so ill! Especially if you take care to shew, How much you here to his example owe. PROCKTOPHANTASMIST. What! are ye always there? nay, ye are quite incurable! In this enlightened age, such things are not endurable! The lawless demon-pack, they play their tricks undaunted; We are so wondrous wise, and yet the house is haunted. How long have I not swept the cobwebs of delusion, And still the world remains in the same wild confusion! THE YOUNG WITCH. Be quiet then, and seek some other place! PROCKTOPHANTASMIST. I tell you, Spirits, in your face, This intellectual thrall I cannot bear it; I love to have a free unshackled spirit. (The dance goes on.) To-day I see that all my strength is spent in vain; I've had a tour, at least, to compensate my evils, And hope, before I come to Blocksberg back again, To crush, with one good stroke, the poets and the devils. MEPHISTOPHELES. He will now go and set him in a puddle— A med'cine 'tis your admiration merits— And, when horse-leeches on his haunches guzzle, He feels quite cured of spirit and of spirits. (To Faust, who has just left the dance.) Why do you let the lovely damsel go, That in the dance, with sweet song, pleased you so? FAUST. Alas! while she so passing sweet was singing, I saw a red mouse from her mouth outspringing. MEPHISTOPHELES. Pooh! on the Brocken that's a thing of course. Let not such freaks disturb your sweet discourse. Go join the crew, and dance away; Enough, the red mouse was not gray. FAUST. Then saw I— MEPHISTOPHELES. What? FAUST. Mephisto, see'st thou there A pale yet lovely girl, in lonely distance fare? From place to place she moves on slow, With shackled feet she seems to go. I must confess, she has a cast Of Margaret, when I saw her last. MEPHISTOPHELES. Let that alone! your fancy learn to bridle. It is a magic show, a lifeless idol The Greek ???????, ghost, wraith.. For men to look upon it is not good. Its fixed gaze hath power to freeze the blood, And petrify you stiff as clay. 'Tis a Medusa in its way. FAUST. In truth, I see the eyes of one that's dead, On which no closing hand of love was laid. That is the breast, that Margaret offer'd me, That the sweet body I enjoyed so free. MEPHISTOPHELES. There lies the witchcraft o't, thou silly simpleton! A sweetheart's mask she wears to every one. FAUST. What ecstasy! and yet what pain! I cannot leave it for my life. How strangely this most lovely neck A single stripe of red doth deck, No broader than the back o'a knife! MEPHISTOPHELES. Quite right! I see it, just as well as you. She wears her head beneath her elbow too, For Perseus cut it off, as well you know. What! will you still a-dreaming go? Come, let us mount the hillock—there We shall have noble sport, believe me; For, unless mine eyes deceive me, They have got up a theatre. What make you here? A SERVANT. You are just come in time. 'Tis a new piece, the last of all the seven, For such the number that with us is given. A dilettante 'twas that wrote the rhyme, And dilettanti are the actors too. Excuse me, Sirs,—no disrespect to you, Attention to one's duty is the law here; I am the dilettante curtain drawer. MEPHISTOPHELES. Upon the Brocken you should always dwell, I know no place that suits you half so well. WALPURGIS-NIGHT'S DREAM; OR OBERON AND TITANIA'S GOLDEN HIGHTIDE. INTERMEZZO. DIRECTOR OF THE THEATRE. Here rest we where we ne'er have been; The valiant sons of Mieding; The Brocken serves us for a scene, To play the fairy wedding. HERALD. The golden high-tide is it then, When fifty years pass over; But doubly golden is it when All brawls and strifes they cover. OBERON. Ye spirits, who obey my law, Be loyal now or never, When Oberon and Titania Anew are bound together. PUCK. Puck comes in first, and turns athwart, His merry circles wheeling; And hundreds more behind him dart, Loud shouts of laughter pealing. ARIEL. Ariel commands the song, And fills the air with rare tones; Crooked imps he lures along, But lures he eke the fair ones. OBERON. When man and wife begin to strive, Let our example guide them! To teach a pair in peace to live, You only need divide them. TITANIA. When scolds the wife, and frets the man, Then on the instant seize them; Transport her South far as you can, And to the Arctic seas him. ORCHESTRA. Tutti. (Fortissimo.) Snout of fly, and nose of gnat, Lead on the band before us! Frog and cricket, cat and bat, Join merry in the chorus! SOLO. A soap-bell for a doodle-sack Dudelsack. A bagpipe., The merry waters troubling! Hear the snecke-snicke-snack, From its snub-nose bubbling! EMBRYO SPIRIT. Legs of spider, paunch of toad, And wings the little wight has; And, though he has no head, yet he His small poetic flight has. A PAIR OF DANCERS. With many a nimble pace and spring, Through honey-dew and vapour, Trips o'er the ground the little thing, But higher cannot caper. INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER. Do I see a real thing, Or is it all delusion? Oberon, the fairy king, Amid this wild confusion. ORTHODOX. Though neither tail nor claws are his, 'Tis true beyond all cavil, As devils were the gods of Greece, Must he too be a devil. NORTHERN ARTIST. The motley groups that here I see, I must confess, confound me; But, when I come from Italy, My skill will more profound be. PURIST. Alas! that I should see it too! Here we a riot rare have! Of all the crew, there are but two, That powder on their hair have. YOUNG WITCH. Your powder, like your petticoat Suits hags that old and gray be I set me plump on my he-goat, And naked here display me. MATRON. To speak with such a shameless pack, We have nor will nor leisure; Soon may your flesh rot on your back, And we look on with pleasure. LEADER OF THE ORCHESTRA. Snout of fly, and nose of gnat, Sting not the naked beauty! Frog and cricket, cat and bat, Attend ye to your duty! (to the one side.) WEATHERCOCK. A goodly company! as sure As I stand on the steeple; With brides and bridegrooms swarms the moor, The hopefulest of people! (to the other side.) WEATHERCOCK. And opes not suddenly the ground, To swallow one and all up, Then, with a jerk, I'll veer me round, And straight to hell I'll gallop. XENIEN. We insects keep them all in awe, With sharpest scissars shear we; Old Nick, our worthy Squire Papa, Here to salute appear we. HENNINGS. See! how around the banquet they Jest merrily together; The graceless crew have hearts, they say, As good as any other. MUSAGETES. Among this witch and wizard crew, I do delight to lose me; Much less than when I lead the Mu- Ses' choir, it doth confuse me. CI-DEVANT GENIUS OF THE AGE. The Brocken has a good broad back, Come take me by the cue, Sir; Like the High-Dutch Parnassus, it Has room for me and you, Sir. INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER. Say, who is he so stiff that goes, With stiff and measur'd paces? He snuffs and snuffles with his nose, “The Jesuits he traces.” CRANE. In muddy waters do I fish As well as where it clear is, And only for such cause as this The pious man too here is. WORLDLING. O yes! the saints are wont, we know, By every thing to profit; They'll find their way to Blocksberg too Though much they use to scoff it. DANCER. A sound of drums! a sound of men! That wafted on the wind came!— The weary bitterns, in the fen, Are booming—never mind them! DANCING-MASTER. Lo! how they kick, and how they jump! How well each figure shewn is! Springs the crooked, hops the plump! Each thinks him an Adonis! A GOOD FELLOW. How brawls the vile pedantic pack! Within their breasts what ire hid! But dance they all to the doodle-sack, As the beasts to Orpheus' lyre did. DOGMATIST. I let no one bamboozle me, With doubts and critic cavils; The Devil sure must something be, Else whence so many devils? IDEALIST. This time doth mighty phantasy Too wildly overrule me; If I am all that now I see, I surely must a fool be! REALIST. That on the Brocken ghosts appear Now scarce admits disputing; Amid this hurly burly here I've fairly lost my footing. SUPERNATURALIST. Into this swarming hellish brood I come, without intrusion; From evil spirits to the good, It is a just conclusion. SCEPTIC. They chase the flame that flits about, And deem them near their treasure; Best rhymes with doubt this demon-rout, And I look on with pleasure. LEADER OF THE ORCHESTRA. Snout of fly, and nose of gnat, Ye stupid Dilettanti! Frog and cricket, cat and bat, Keep better time why can't ye? NIMBLE SPIRITS. Sansconci is hight the crew On limber limbs that ply it; When on our feet it will not do, Then on our heads we try it. AWKWARD SQUAD. Time was, we bow'd and scrap'd our way To smack at many a rare treat; But now, we've danced our shoes away, And walk upon our bare feet. IGNES FATUI. Though born but with the sultry ray, This morn, in the morass all, Yet now, amid the gallants gay, We shine here and surpass all. FALLING STAR. From the ether's height I shot, Where stars of meteor blaze be, Here on the ground now lie I squat, O! who will help to raise me? PLUMP SPIRITS. Make way! make way! a sturdy crew, O'er brier and bramble jump we; Spirits are we, Spirits too Have limbs that thick and plump be. PUCK. Why tramp ye so majestical As cub of river-horse is? The plumpest spirit of you all Stout Puck himself of course is. ARIEL. If loving nature's bounteous care With pinions hath adorn'd ye, Then tread my airy track to where The heights of rosy morn be. ORCHESTRA. (pianissimo.) Clouds and mists now disappear; The stage and all together, With one single puff of air Is vanished into ether. END OF THE INTERLUDE. SCENE III. A cloudy day. The Fields. Faust and Mephistopheles. FAUST. In misery! in despair! Wandering in hopeless wretchedness over the wide earth, and at last made prisoner! Shut up like a malefactor in a dungeon, victim of the most horrible woes—poor miserable girl! Must it then come to this! Thou treacherous and most worthless Spirit! this hast thou concealed from me!—Stand thou there! stand!—Roll round thy devilish eyes, infuriated within thy head! Stand and confront me with thy insupportable presence. A prisoner! in irredeemable misery! given over to evil spirits, and to the condemning voice of the unfeeling world! and me, meanwhile, thou cradlest to sleep amid a host of the most insipid dissipations, concealing from my knowledge her aggravated woes! —while she—she is left in hopeless wretchedness to die! MEPHISTOPHELES. She's not the first. FAUST. Dog! abominable monster!—Change him, O thou infinite Spirit! change the reptile back again into his original form—the poodle that ran before me in the twilight, now trembling at the feet of the harmless wanderer, now springing on his shoulders!— Change him again into his favourite shape, that he may crouch on his belly in the sand before me, and I may tramp him underneath my feet, the reprobate!— Not the first! Misery, misery! by no human soul to be conceived! that more than one creature of God should ever have been plunged into the depth of this woe! that the first, in the writhing agony of her death, should not have atoned for the guilt of all the rest before the eyes of the eternally Merciful! It digs even unto the marrow of my life, the misery of this one; and thou—thou grinnest composedly over the wretchedness of thousands! MEPHISTOPHELES. Here are we arrived at the boundary of our wits, where the thread of human reason snaps in sunder. Wherefore seekest thou communion with us, unless thou would'st carry it through? Would'st fly, and yet art not proof against giddiness? Did we thrust ourselves on you, or you on us? FAUST. Show not thy rows of voracious teeth to me! It nauseates me!—Great and glorious Spirit, who didst condescend to reveal thyself to me, who knowest my heart and my soul, wherefore didst thou bind me down to this vilest of complices, who feeds on mischief, and rejoiceth in destruction? MEPHISTOPHELES. Hast thou finished? FAUST. Deliver her! or woe to thee!—the direst of curses be on thee for ever! MEPHISTOPHELES. I cannot loose the bonds of the avenger, nor open his bars.—Deliver her! Who was it that plunged her into destruction? I or thou? (Faust looks wildly round.) MEPHISTOPHELES. (continues.) Wouldst thou grasp the thunder? 'Tis well that you, poor mortals, have it not to wield! To smash the innocent in pieces is the proper tyrant's fashion of venting one's spleen in a dilemma. FAUST. Bring me to her! She shall be free! MEPHISTOPHELES. And the danger to which thou exposest thyself! Know that the guilt of blood from thy hand still lies upon the town. Above the spot where the slain fell, avenging spirits hover and lie in wait for the returning murderer. FAUST. That too from thee? Murder and death of a world on thee, thou monster! Bring me to her, I say, and deliver her! MEPHISTOPHELES. I'll lead thee thither, and what I can do that I will do. Mark me! Have I all power on heaven and on earth? I will cloud the wits of the warder, and thou may'st seize the keys, and bring her out with the hand of a man. I wait for you with the magic horses to ensure your escape. This can I do. FAUST. Up and away! SCENE IV. Night. The open Field. Faust. Mephistopheles. (Galloping past on black horses.) FAUST. What work they, flitting round the Raven-stone? Rabenstein. Place of Execution. MEPHISTOPHELES. Can't say what they are boiling and working at. FAUST. They hover up, they hover down, they bend them, they bow them. MEPHISTOPHELES. A corporation of witches. FAUST. They seem to be sprinkling and blessing something. MEPHISTOPHELES. On! on! SCENE V. A Prison. Faust, with a bundle of keys in his hand and a lamp, before an iron-door. FAUST. Strange shuddering dread comes o'er me—seizes me All the collected wretchedness of time. Here dwells she now behind this wintry wall, And sweet delusion was her only crime! Fear'st thou to go to her? Tremblest to meet her eye? Quick! thy delay but hastens her death on. (He seizes the lock. Singing heard from within.) My mother, the whore That did me slay! My father, the knave That ate me up! My sister dear In the cool green shade My bones she laid. Then was I a glad little bird of the wood; Fly away! fly away! FAUST. (opening the door.) She dreams not that her lov'd one is so near, The clinking chains and rustling straw to hear. MARGARET. (hiding herself on the bed.) Woe, woe! they come.—To bitter death they call. FAUST. (softly.) Hush! hush! I come to free thee from them all. MARGARET. (throwing herself at his feet.) Art thou a man, feel for my hapless plight. FAUST. Thy cries will wake the watchers of the night! (he takes hold of the chains to unloose them.) MARGARET. (on her knees.) Who gave thee, hangman, such a power To drag me from my cell at midnight hour? Have pity on me, use me not so rough!— Surely to-morrow morn is soon enough. (she stands up.) So young, so very young, am I, And must already die! Once was I lovely too—'twas this that caus'd my fall. Near was the friend, now he is far away; Torn lies the wreath, the flowers are scattered all, O tear me not so forcibly away! Spare me! what have I done to injure thee? O hear my prayer! for once compassion shew!— 'Tis the first time I ever look'd on thee. FAUST. That I should live to see such depth of woe! MARGARET. Thou hast me now completely in thy might. Only first give me time to suckle my sweet child. I hugg'd it the whole weary night; They took't from me to give me pain, And now they say that it was kill'd By me.—And never shall I smile again. They sing songs on me, too!—'tis an ill-natur'd thing! Such is the ending of a well-known song, Who told them that its words to me belong? FAUST. (throwing himself down.) Here, at thy feet, see one who loves thee cling, Deliverance from these bonds of woe to bring! MARGARET. (falling beside him on her knees.) Yes! let us kneel to call upon the Saints! Beneath these steps, I hear it well! Beneath the threshold, Boileth hell! The evil One His fury vents, With fearful noise! FAUST. (loud.) Margaret! Margaret! MARGARET. (attentive.) That was the lov'd one's voice! (she springs up, the chains fall away.) Where is he? where? I heard him call on me, Now I am free! and none shall hinder me! To his neck will I fly! On his bosom lie! He called me Margaret! at the door he stood. Through the wild howling and clattering of hell, Through the loud-laughing scorn of the fiendish brood, Came the sweet voice of love that I know so well. FAUST. 'Tis I! MARGARET. 'Tis thou! O say it yet again! (clasping him.) 'Tis he! 'tis he! Where now is all my pain? Where all my prison's woe? my fetters where? 'Tis he! he comes my freedom to prepare! Now am I free! Already the well-known street I see, Where the first time I spoke to thee, And the cheerful garden, where Martha and I did wait on thee. FAUST. (striving forward.) Come, come! MARGARET. O stay, stay! Thou know'st how pleased I stay where thou dost stay. (caressing him.) FAUST. Away, away! Unless we haste, Dear shall we pay for these few moments' waste. MARGARET. How! giv'st thou me no kiss? My friend, so very short a space away, And hast forgot to kiss? Why feel I now so straiten'd round thy neck? Whereas of old thy words, thy glances, spoke A very heaven, and thou didst kisses take So many, as if thou wouldst make me choke. Kiss me! Else kiss I thee! (she embraces him.) —O woe! thy lips are cold, Are dumb. Where is the love thou hadst for me of old? Who was it, Henry, robb'd me of thy love? (She turns away from him.) FAUST. Come with me, sweet love, come! I'll hug thee ten times closer than before, Only come with me now! Come, I emplore! MARGARET. (turning to him.) Art thou then he? Art thou then truly he? FAUST. 'Tis I, in truth. Come, love, and follow me. MARGARET. And these vile chains thou breakest, And me again unto thy bosom takest? How comes it that thou dost not spurn me from thee? Know'st thou then, Henry, whom thou com'st to free? FAUST. Come, come! the deep hour of the night doth flee. MARGARET. My mother made I sleep a sleep profound! My little child I drown'd! Was it not heaven's boon to me and thee? Thee, too!—'tis thou! I scarce may credit it: Give me thy hand. It is no dream. Thy dear, dear hand!—Alas! but it is wet! Wipe it away, for it doth seem As were there blood on it. O God! what hast thou done? Put up thy sword; I pray thee put it up. FAUST. Let what is gone for evermore be gone. Thou stabbest me with daggers, every word. MARGARET. No, thou shalt survive our sorrow! I will describe the graves to thee, Where thou shalt bury them and me To-morrow. The best place thou shalt give my mother, Close beside her lay my brother; Me a little to the side, But at distance not too wide! And my child at my right breast.— These only share our place of rest. Me on thy loving side to press, That was a heaven of blessedness! But now, I cannot do it more; I feel as if to thee I must compel me, And thou didst coldly back repel me; And yet 'tis thou!—as good, as loving as before. FAUST. Feel'st thou that 'tis I, then come! MARGARET. Out there? FAUST. Into the open air. MARGARET. If the grave be there, And death there lurks, then come! Hence to my eternal home, Not a step more.— Thou leav'st me now?—would I might go with thee? FAUST. Thou canst, if thou but wilt. I have unbarr'd the door. MARGARET. I may not go; no hope remains for me. They watch me close—'tis all in vain to flee. It is so sad to beg from door to door, And with an evil conscience to boot. A homeless earth to wander o'er; And they are sure at last to find me out. FAUST. I will protect thee. MARGARET. Quick! Quick! Save thy poor child! Away, away! Keep the path Up the stream, Across the bridge, To the left hand, Where the plank stands, In the pond. Seize it, quick! It rises up, It kicks! it lives! O save it, save it! FAUST. Only bethink thee! One step more, and thou art free. MARGARET. Would we were past that mountain gray! There sits my mother on a stone— I feel a hand that pulls me back As cold as clay! There sits my mother on a stone, Her head wags heavily; She winks not, she nods not, her head she may not raise. She slept so long, she never more may wake. She slept that we might our enjoyment take. O these were happy days! FAUST. Here words and prayers will only make things worse; Wilt thou not come, then bring I thee by force. MARGARET. Let me alone! lay no rough hands on me! Nor with such murderous clutches seize me! Thou know'st I have done every thing to please thee. FAUST. The day is gray! Come, sweet love, follow me! MARGARET. Day! yes, it is day! the judgment-day breaks in! My marriage-day it should have been! Let no one know thou wert before with Margaret. Woe to my wreath! 'Tis done! 'tis done! We will meet again; But not at the dance. The multitude in silent crowds are thronging, The squares, the streets, Cannot contain them all. The bell doth call, The staff doth break, They bind me with cords, and drag me away, And on the bloody scaffold me lay. And every trembling eye doth quake At the blade that is brandish'd o'er my neck. Mute lies the world as the grave! FAUST. O that I ne'er were born! MEPHISTOPHELES. (appearing from without.) Up! or we are undone. Profitless whining, whimpering, and prating! Meanwhile my frozen steeds are waiting, Snuffing the scent of the morning sun. MARGARET. What see I rising from the floor? 'Tis he! 'Tis he! O Henry send him hence. What seeks he on this place of penitence? He comes for me! FAUST. No! thou shalt live. MARGARET. Judgment of God! to thee my soul I give. MEPHISTOPHELES. (to FAUST.) Come, come! else will I leave you in the lurch. MARGARET. Thine am I, Father! Father, save thou me! Ye angels! ye most holy spirits! now Encamp around me! and protect me now! Henry! I tremble when I think on thee. MEPHISTOPHELES. She is judged! VOICE. (from above) Is saved! MEPHISTOPHELES. (to FAUST.) Hither to me! VOICE. (from within, dying away.) Henry! Henry!

      <field name="fulltext">POSTSCRIPT. I doubt not some of my readers have been not a little surprised and disappointed in not meeting with the celebrated “Prologue in Heaven,” prefixed to this drama. I had translated the whole of this piece, and intended to have inserted it complete in its proper place, immediately after the prelude, but I was dissuaded from this by friends whose opinion I respect; and I am perfectly convinced, that the motives, as well of propriety as of prudence, that have induced me to give it here in a somewhat castigated shape, will satisfy every reasonable person of proper feeling. For neither the indifference with which this matter is treated by persons with whom piety is not ranked among the virtues, nor the more refined sophistries of those who attempt to justify this Prologue on certain latitudinarian principles, said to be peculiar to German Aesthetics, could ever convince me, that the tone of careless familiarity in which things divine are here spoken of, was in any wise worthy of the great poet from whom it came. It could, therefore, be my duty as a translator alone, that could ever have induced me to publish this Prologue. But an English translation of a celebrated poem such as Faust, is not intended, like an edition of an ancient classic, to circulate only among a few of the learned. In this case, it is the duty of a translator to consult the feelings of those for whom the translation is made; and no one can blame him for removing from the gate of his poetic garden a sentinel, whose strange and forbidding demeanour could not fail to repel the chief of those visitors, whose good will he was most anxious to conciliate. Actuated by such motives, I have given the Prologue here, stript merely of those colloquial familiarities, which are its chief blemish in the original. Take away the tone of conversational levity from this much-bespoken piece, and I fear not to say that, in the matter of it, there is nothing that can give offence to the most strait-laced orthodoxy. Those who compare my translation with Shelley's or Mr Hayward's, will find that I have omitted nothing that is anywise essential to the subject-matter of the Prologue; and I rather feel pleased that, in the shape in which it here stands, it will probably give satisfaction to all, except those impure and ignoble minds whose memory is chiefly retentive of a few obscenities and levities, which, like so many casual spots on the sun, and arising perhaps unavoidably from the nature of the subject, throw a slight shade of human weakness over this noblest and—let me speak it in the words of my own feeling—this divinest of poems. PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN. The Lord. The Heavenly Hosts, afterwards Mephistopheles. The three Archangels come forward. RAPHAEL. The Sun doth chime his ancient music, To brethren-spheres' contending song, And, on his fore-appointed journey, With thunder-pace he rolls along. Strength drink the angels from his glances, Though no one comprehend him may; God's works of grandeur unconceived, Are bright as on creation's day. GABRIEL. And swift, and swift, beyond conceiving, Spins Earth its self-revolving flight; Alternates Paradisian brightness, With gloom of deep and fearful night. Wide foams the sea in mighty currents, Beneath the rocks, with murmurs hoarse; And rock and sea are onward hurried In one eternal circling course. MICHAEL. And storms loud rage with storms contending, From sea to land, from land to sea, And weave around the globe unwearied A chain of deepest energy. The lightning's desolation flameth Before the pealing thunder's way, But still, O Lord, thine angels worship The soft revolving of thy day. THE THREE TOGETHER. Strength drink the angels from thy glances, Though no one comprehend thee may, Thy works of grandeur unconceived, Are bright as on creation's day. So far this splendid hymn, which might, in all justice, be allowed to plead as loudly for Goethe's piety, as the subsequent part of this Prologue has been supposed to do for his indifference in things religious. Then enters Mephistopheles, and after introducing himself, on the score of his having been allowed from the most ancient times to shew himself amongst the sons of God (Job i. 6), and apologising in language the most revolting to well-tuned ears, for his deficiency in the art of hymn-making, proceeds to descant, in a true Byronic strain, on that threadbare and profitless theme, the misery of human nature: Of sun and worlds I little have to say, I only see how men must fret their lives away. The little god o'the world continues still the same, A riddle great as when first from your hands he came. A little better would he drag life on, Had he the semblance not of heavenly light from Thee; He calls it reason, but uses it alone To be more brutish than brute can be. He is, methinks, Like one of the long-legged race Of grasshoppers, that spring, and spring, and spring, And straightway in the grass the same old song they sing; 'Twere well that from the grass he never rose, On every stubble must he break his nose! To this hackneyed burden of a hackneyed song, it is answered: Hast thou then nothing more to say? Must I still hear the same complaint Against the Earth from day to day? Wilt thou then never be content? Discontent is the soul of Byronism and devilry, and Mephistopheles accordingly replies: No, Lord! I find things there no better than before; I must confess I do deplore Man's hapless lot, and scarce have heart myself To torture the poor miserable elf. The Devil is then asked if he knows Faust, the vassal (knecht) of the Lord. To which answer is made in the affirmative, with the following characteristic description of the Doctor's character: His food and drink are of no earthly taste, His restless spirit drives him to the waste, His madness he himself half understands; The loveliest stars from Heaven he demands, And every highest joy that Earth commands, And all that's near, and all that's far, Soothes not his deep-moved spirit's war. To this, the important answer is given: Though destined for a time to grope his way, Soon shall I lead him into open day. Well knows the gard'ner when green shoots appear, That bloom and fruit await the coming year. The Devil then asks permission to tempt Faust, and a dialogue ensues, of which the form, if not the spirit, is evidently borrowed from the second chapter of the Book of Job. It is first answered: As long as on the earth he lives, So long thou hast my free permission; Man still must err so long he strives. Mephistopheles accepts the permission; and adds, in his own cold sarcastic manner: ? With the dead 'Tis not my wont to ply my trade. I chiefly prize the cheeks that plump and rosy be. For a vile corpse my taste is far too nice; I do just as the cat does with the mice. The Devil then receives full permission to try all his efforts against Faust: Go, drag this spirit from his native fount, And lead him on, can'st thou his will surmount, Into perdition down with thee. But stand ashamed when thou at length shalt see, An honest man, mid all his strivings dark, Finds the right way, though lit but by a spark. These two last lines are of the utmost importance, as obscurely intimating the design of the poet to bring Faust to Heaven in the long run. The fiend now exults in the prospect of success, and exclaims, in the language of a boaster: If I should carry through my measure, My triumph then from free lungs let me hold; Dust shall he eat, and that with pleasure, Like my cousin the serpent so fam'd of old. The answer given to this speech is important, in connection with the character of Goethe's devil; and also, towards the conclusion, poetically beautiful, though not without a tincture of what we are wont to call “German mysticism.” We give it complete: And even so, thou hast full liberty To shew thee here, whene'er it pleases thee. Of all the spirits that deny, The cunning rogue gives least offence to me. From labour man is far too apt to shrink, And into utter sloth to sink; As comrade, therefore, I assign'd him one Who, as a restless devil, still whets and spurs him on. But you, ye sons of Heaven's own choice, In the One living Beautiful rejoice! The self-evolving Energy divine, Enclasp you round with love's embrace benign, And to the hov'ring forms that round you float, Give firm existence by enduring thought. And with this the heaven closes, and the angels disperse; and the reader has before him the whole of the much bespoken Prologue, curtailed by scarce a dozen of lines, which have nothing to recommend them but their levity. In other respects, however, this Prologue is worth studying, as it affords, in some sense, a key to the characters of Faust and Mephistopheles; and of their mutual relation, at least in the poet's view, to that Being whose guiding hand directs unseen every action, meanest as well as greatest, in the varied drama of human life.</field>
