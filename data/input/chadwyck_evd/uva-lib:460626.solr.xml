      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS Earl Edmund. Sir James Montgomery. Antinous. Clown. Captain Mercer. Ringan Deane, a boy. Lady Montgomery. May Montgomery. Mary-Jane. Bellona. Herminia. Annie Smith, a girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene: A Country Town in Scotland.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I SCENE.âA Room, opening off a Ballroom. Enter a lady dressed as an Amazon, and a gentleman dressed as a Clown; both masked. Clown. Fair warrior, how speed you in a fight, If all fordone after the second waltz? Amazon. My soul is tired of folly, not my limbs. Good clown, of your light wit enlighten me Concerning somewhat cloudy. Clown. Certainly. My light wit if it may dispel your night, Will flaunt as proudly as the sun. Behold! [Unmasks. Amazon. You are too hot. I would not, sir be scorched: Becloud your beams again. Your eyes burn brightâ Oh!âlike the round holes carved in turnip-lamps, Lit up by boys on witching hallow-e'ens To fright their sisters and the serving-maids: I am afraid: clap to the shutters, pray. [Clown masks. Now, like the hollowed orbs of the baboon Your eyes gleam furtivelyâlike rush-lights dim That steal into the night through secret chinks Of steep-thatched huts in lonely highland glens. Clown. I might enlarge upon the periods On either side your nose, that put an end By saucy looks to any parleying Save that of sharp-edged words: but haste me now To know the darkness which I must illume. Amazon. What wight is he, as gentle Sidney dressed, Who casts his wit about like pearlsâI mean Like pearl-less oysters, which the crowd accept, Unskilled or unconcerned, as worth mirth's price, While you and I perceive them what they are, Sad fish indeed, old, stale, unsavoury? Clown. I've marked him well, but know not who he is: He seems to be acquaint with comic writers. Know you the nymph that danced with him but nowâ She, with the rosy garlandâonly hue About her white robe save her golden hairâ With frank blue eyes that always seem to ring With peals of fairy laughter, summer's queen? Enter a gentleman dressed as a Corsair, and a lady dressed as a Contadina; both masked. Amazon. Hush! Clown. Ah! I noted these in the last waltz. Amazon. She's my full cousin; he, a highland one. I think they be in love. Enter a gentleman dressed as an Elizabethan Courtier, and a lady dressed to symbolise Summer. After them runs in hurriedly a lady dressed as a Scotch Peasant-girl. They are masked. The Courtier shuts the door and puts his back against it. Clown. Our cynosures! Amazon. Indeed! Pray, let me out. Courtier. Superb she-warrior, rest you here a space: Nay, frown not, most redoubted amazon: I have a thing to say: I'll say it now. That which the world calls folly is my trade, Unwitting that its trade is only folly. I neither crave the statesman's rancid fame, The sailor's vogue, the soldier's red renown, Nor care I to discover: Africa Agrees not well with my adventurous sprite; The negress is not lovelyâthat's the die: Nor is the Arctic climate amorous. I wrote a bookâGood lack, the solitude! But first the woe by which I was confined! O Luna, of thy tenderness I pray Let me no more be fructified by woe! The highway?âFie on steam and liveried lightning!â Whate'er I fancy if I may I do. A happy notion fills me now; give ear, Gentle and lovely ladies, gentlemen, Sprightly and handsome. Will you hearken it? [They assent. It is my earnest hope to make you mad.â These gala robes wherein we now are dressed Why should we cast for good and all to-night, To don the wintry worldling's dingy slough, Returning sadly to the chrysalis? Fashion, propriety, convention?âTush! Let us like noble heretics protest Against all dogmas false and fashionable, And, if need be, with righteous resignation Attest our faith in glorious martyrdom, Tied to opinion's stake, and burned by tongues Of scandalous fire, blazing from faggot hearts. Then, gentle friends, since such is our resolve, We can do nothing nobler than attack Fashion's mainstay, the discipline of dress. I swear that you may well with less ado Worship the sun, keep harems, or, like France When liberty became beside herself, Extend the week from seven days to tenâ Yea, set apart and consecrate each day To traversing with all your might and main, In order, Moses' ten âcommandements,â Than steadfast be in non-observance brave Of the great ordinance of dressing all In fashion's right religious uniform. So, shall we dare the world? Who says with me, To wear this fancy dress to-morrow too In the sun's kindly, and the world's ill, eye? Amazon. Suppose we do, what issue do you see? Courtier. Whatever fantasies our minds may don We shall expound with these our fancy clothes. There is none here, I think, to whom I'm known, Nor do I know a single one of you; So I propose that each assume some name To complement the dress worn, to be used While we are in this mood. Clown [to Amazon]. If that were fixed You should be called war's bride, Bellona bold. Bellona. Bellona would be bold to call you clown. Corsair [to Contadina]. I'll call youâwhat? Some lingering name: Herminia! Herminia. Herminia! Corsair. What name for me, Herminia? What word, however harsh, would by your lips Be sweetened to a note of Syren strength, That, whispered, should have force to summon me From Iceland to Ceylon. Tell me, Herminia. Herminia. I think Antinous should be your name. Courtier [to Summer]. And you, sweet summerâFlora? Summer. I'd be called, And for no other reason than I would, Not Flora, no, nor Maud, but Mary-Jane. Courtier [to Peasant-girl]. Sweet lowland lassâalas, without a lad!â Will you be of us and yourself re-christen. Peasant-girl. I harboured here to shun a horrid man Whom I saw, like a pirate, bearing down To rob me of a dance. I'll sport with you. Courtier. What name, then, lassie?âEffie, Jeanie, Katie? Peasant-girl. No; call me May Montgomery, if you please. Courtier. What? May Montgomery! Why choose that name? None of the rest have been extravagant To take a surname's luxury. May. Let meâ Nay, for I will: I'll not be in the fashion: And it will be a pleasing penance, too. Courtier. A pleasing penance! Can you tell us how? May. I scarcely like. But, sir, I like your play, Because I would be called Montgomery. Courtier. Then, May Montgomery, tell us your romance. May. Alas, the speed I have to tell my tale Is slow as melancholy thoughts can be, That strike as often as a passing-bell: A bitter-sweet confession I must make. O ladies, do not fit your faces, pray, For some iniquity! Sadly, 'tis this. In Paris, where I lived a year ago, A youth fell sick in love for worthless me: I marvel now, though then I thought it due: Yet love creates, being a divinity, What it affects; and his most holy love Inspired poor me with beauty not my own, Though still I wonder that what grace I have Could be enriched with such induement sweet As he cast over it; for at that time He lacked his passion's courage, so he wrote A tender tale whose heroine was me, But metamorphosed to a deity. The book is throbbing like his fiery heart; This I have learned with memorising it: And now it is my only orison, My only literature, my only joy. I lull myself to sleep low-murmuring it, And in my dreams its sweetest scenes enact; I waken smiling in his tender arms, And sob to find mine clasped about myself. After his book he came to hear his doom: Trembling he stood: I, wanton, doomed us bothâ Him to his grave, for then I loved him not; Myself, to love him now most hopelessly. And May Montgomery in his book I am: Pray, call me so; it is a lovely name. Courtier. And is your lover dead? May. I fear it, sir. Courtier. Now, are we named anew, all except me. How will you call me? Come, give me a name What in his story is your lover hight? May. Earl Edmund; and the whisper went that he By right was lord of many lands and towers In Scotland here: but that I do not know. Courtier. I pray you, bid me take that name. May. O no! Earl Edmund! That were blasphemy!âBut yes! I will be glad to speak it out aloud. Edmund. Speak it, I pray, as often as you choose.â Well, I am tired of barring up this door. So, on the morrow, by the stroke of noon Be all together, dressed as now we are, Assembled at the distant, dusky end Of that most pleasant pathway of the glen, Where lovers, shaded by a green arcade, Wander toward eventide, slow, silently. May. The Alley of Sighs. Edmund. So is it called, I think. Bellona. What there to do, I pray you? Edmund. I know not: Plan nothing, and you'll see a wondrous plot. Meantime, unmask, and let us see ourselves. [They unmask. Now, call our names. They go out, repeating their new names. Mary-Jane and May Montgomery re-enter immediately. May. Sweet mother, do you know how well you look? They all think you at least as young as I. Mary-Jane. My darling, it is you who keep me young: The world is young while you are fresh and fair. I was eighteen when you were born, my dear: I'm more than twice your age, for you're sixteen. May. Which no one will believe.âTo think that I At fifteen should be loved with such a love As poor Earl Edmund's was!âNow, Mary-Jane, Do you intend to play in this new game? Mary-Jane. I think they merely mean a passing joke. May. O no! it is to be an earnest joke. Do let them call me May Montgomery! Besides, he whom I am to call Earl Edmund Has got his eyes and voiceâindeed he has. Mary-Jane. Well, we will go to-morrow to the glen: I like the company of sprightly men: And you will have this earl to clarify The sorrow-shaded cheek and tear-dimmed eye. May. O Mary-Jane, I am a widow too! I'll never wed another; nor will you. [They go out. Re-enter Earl Edmund. Edmund. She looks at me perplexed and wistfully; But I am certain that she knows me not. How should she! When her memory might have caught A faithful copy of me, love, unrisen, Shrank from the dawn: and so it is that now When love has flooded all her life, the shape Conceived of me within her inmost heart Must be the picture of a false ideal: I dread to think how fine a thing she loves. I'm glad she cannot pierce my sanguine mood, And find the haggard child of pain and care, Who, pain being dead, and in pale care's despite, Has laughed himself to pleasant looks and strength. Of my identity the sudden news Would to my suit hardly be suitable: Wherefore I'll fall upon some easy course, And gently glide unfelt into her heart. [Goes out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II SCENE.âThe Alley of Sighs. Enter Ringan Deane and Annie Smith. Ringan. What is the meaning of your face to-day? Will you not speak? Then sit down here awhile. [They sit. She gives him a daisy. But Annie, speak. This flower is very well: Now let me have some blossoms from your tongue. What are these roses struggling in your cheeks, And withering with your waxing, waning smile, Which something means and yet is that thing's veil? Is it love's sun that rises? Is it love Beginning to embalm your heart's sweet flood, And dyeing deep the roses that now die, Now flourish in your cheeks?âIf you'll not speak, Then here's a thing to do. Read this aloud. [Gives her a paper. And read it in your softest, dreamiest tones; Clothe with your voice my verses' skeletons. Annie [reading]. [I.] Where have you been to-day, Annie Smith, Where have you been to-day? By the shore where the river becomes a frith? Or up on the hills, away, By purple heather and saffron broom Like clouds at the sunset hour, And all the well-kent flowers that bloom In each breezy hillside bower? Were you there, Annie Smith, that your face is so gay And your eyes so laughing and blue? Was it there that you spent the whole of the day? Or, tell me, darling, were you In the leafy wood where the grass grows thick With the fairies at their play? Did you flirt with Oberon, dance with Puck, That your face, Annie Smith, is so gay? Where have you been to-day, Annie Smith, That you smile so gaily on me? By the shore where the river becomes a frith? Or were you upon the sea? Did you sail in a pearly shell, Annie Smith, With your hair flying free? Do your laughing blue eyes tell, Annie Smith, Such a happy tale of the sea? Or were you down in the caves, Annie Smith, With the mermaids under the sea? Did the mermen beneath the waves, Annie Smith, Try to catch and keep you from me? Or did you fly through the air all the day? Did you frolic with the wind? Did you dine with the man in the moon, I pray, That your face and your eyes are so laughing and gay? Come, Annie, Annie, be quick and say Where you have been the whole of the day, In your body or in your mind? II. Where have you been, Annie Smith, to-day, That your face and your eyes are so calm? Did you hear in the church the minister pray? Did you join in the holy psalm? Did he tell of the solemn joys of the blest, That your face is so calm and serene, That you seem to have ended each earthly quest? In the church, Annie Smith, have you been? Or did you stand on the shore, Annie Smith, And gaze away to the west? Did you stand where the river becomes a frith, With your hands folded over your breast, And gaze at the golden skyey gate As the sun passed through sublime? Did you get this shadowy light of fate On your face at the sunset time? Or are you an angel, Annie Smith, For a time from your blessedness riven, To guide me over the cold, wan, frith Of death to your happy heaven? Ringan. O, you might precept Mercury's elocution, And teach the Muses and the Sirens singing. Annie. And do you love me, then? Ringan. You know I do. Annie. I love youâand I love you, Ringan Deane. Enter Clown. O, what a curious-looking gentleman! Clown. A pretty pair, indeed!âAnd who are you? Annie. He is a poet, and I am his sweetheart. Clown. A poet is he, sweetheart! Lack-a-day! Bid him go hang or drown without ado; And in Elysium while you live, he'll pray For showers of blessing to descend on you, Whose high behest despatched him to that clime Of peaceful pleasure and warm purple dusk, Ere rained calamity and mouldering time Could rot his spirit in its carnal husk. Or if you needs must keep him, be prepared For daily infidelity, my dear, For you will find your part in him is shared By every beauty he may see or hear; Whether it be of seas, of flowers, of skies, A wind, a woman, or a music note, His hungry passion hugs it till it dies, Leaving him happy with a new-born thought. Annie. He being a poet, must it be so with him? Clown. It is the poet's health and his disease, His joy, his sorrow, his belief and whim, His bane and blessing, and his itch and ease, His night and day, his pestilence and breath, His summer, winter, heaven, hell, life, and death, This passion, shackled to its own desire, Unchained, unchainable within that range, Sateless, bateless, changing without change, Consuming beauty after beauty, higher To toss its blood-stained, heaven-scaling fire. Enter Edmund. Good-morrow, noble earl. What, you look pale! By every gentle oath that is not stale You are a votary of Cupid's throng, And have been keeping vigil all night long At some high window, or in some lone grove; For it is still the doom of those in loveâ O cruelty, most condign and refined!â To watch with Dian and her nymphs unkind, And, like chameleons, take the stars' wan hue, The while their purple hearts love's fire burns through. Last night you seemed unharmed of Venus' son. What! has your cheeks' red radiance trickling gone Out by a broach of last night's archery, When Cupid volleyed shafts from many an eye? Edmund. Late hours, good clown, late hours: I swear that's all. Clown. No; you are in love: I am sure of it. Now, take a little advice from me. Do not addle your brain by imagining that you love a particular lady. You are in love: that's all, and that's enough. O these romancists! It is womankind you love: and these wonderful ladies, if it were not for novels and poetry and traditionâand heredity perhapsâwould never dream of bestowing their affections on an individual. The world's a mere expansion of Adam and Eve: I look upon it as one man and one womanâas manhood and womanhood: and I believe, if you sounded the thought of the world, you would find that is how it regards itself. Edmund. I know a lady who will never regard the world in that light. Clown. O, unsophisticated youth! Edmund. A maid whose bosom is a nunnery chaste Where spotless thoughts like votaresses dwell. Clown. There is not a maid, wife, or widow, whose fancy any man, if he set himself to it, could not conquer; nor any man whom any woman could not subdue if she chose. Edmund. One single fancy like an upright king Sways her most constant loyalty: my love Conceives not that there is in all the world Another man save me; and I, no maid. Clown. I would undertake to make your saintly lady love me, and forget you altogether. Edmund. O, rather would I have my lady hear The hiss of serpents and the howl of hell, Than have the rose-bud beauty of her ear Sullied by such a tale as you would tell! For though a pure portcullis' instant fall Would cut your foul breath from her cloistered brain, On the pink portal like a sooty pall, I fear its filthiness might long remain. If you dared ope your lips and let them hold Most distant parley with a noisome theme, Her eyes would lighten out their glance of gold, And strike you dumb for ever. O, you dream! Clown. You talk, you talk. Honestly I admire your youthful enthusiasm. But these clear-starched opinions, which young men collar themselves with in the first moon of manhood, will soon soil, and be washed and wrung to a rag. But truly, I am in love myself. Edmund. With whom? Clown. She wears the habit of an amazon, And flings her limbs as though they ne'er had moved In Chinese steps within a frock's confine; Whistles, lays hand on hip, laughs at her ease, And seems to signify of two things, oneâ Come, kiss me if you choose, or, if you dare. Enter Antinous, Herminia, May Montgomery, Mary-Jane, and Bellona. Edmund. Good morning, and good morning, gentle friends. Bellona. And who are these? Clown. A sweetheart and her poet. May [to Annie.] Tell me your name, and I will tell you mine. [May and Annie talk apart. Ringan [to Mary-Jane]. O lady, summer's essence, centuries Of sunlight from your eyes my being flood. The sweetest damask of a season's bloom Of roses dyes your cheeks, your tender breath Is sweeter than their scent, and in your hair There shines more gold than ever July spent In gilding leagues of wheat. Mary-Jane. Ha, ha! good boy. You'd better deem me dressed as winter, though. Ringan. O, were you in a snow-drift clad, and hung With icicles about, a glance would tell That you were summer masquerading. Lo! You are the summer, and you could not hide, No more than Venus with her girdle on Could pass for Hecate. And I love you, lady. Mary-Jane. Now, you are foolish, sir. [Crosses to Edmund. Ringan. I fear I am. [Lies down under a tree. Bellona. Have you ever been in love? Clown. I am not such a fool. Bellona. Not such a man, you mean. You are all fools till you be in loveâgreat, lubberly, ill-bred, selfish clowns. And when the selfish passion seizes you, thenâthenâO then! Clown. Why, what then? Bellona. Then you become ten times great, lubberly, ill-bred, selfish clowns. Men are all and always fools.âEarl Edmund we are here. What then? Edmund. Impatient amazon, thus then it is: This hour you must complete as best you can; When it is sped, here gather all again, And on the grass partake a sylvan feast: There shall not want for music; if for song, The blame be with yourselves. Be happy, all.â Sweet May Montgomery will you walk with me? [Edmund and May go out. Bellona. I'll walk alone. [Ringan rushes forward. Well, boy, you look distraught. Ringan. O incarnation of what nymph soe'er, I knew not what it is to love till now; For never have I seen in any maid So much to love as in this heaven appears. Some maidens are like night, and some like day, But hear me swear, since day and night began There has not overhung a thrilled, hushed world A night so bossed with points of admiration, As o'er my soul is imminent in you, Studded with stars of love-enforcing power; Nor has there shone a day so bounteous Of every largesse to a thankful world, But that the joyous motion you instil Throughout my life transcends its benefice: Wherefore, vouchsafe to hear me cry, I love you; And frown not, for the night should never frown Upon the humble flower that yields its scent, Its sole ability of offering; The day should never lower upon the lake Exhaling tears, which is its grateful life. O, be not angry that the life of love Which you infuse in me, here at your feet, For further inspiration or for blight, Lies lowly, and the ground you tread on kisses. [Falls on the ground. Bellona. But what of that fair girl, your sweetheart there? Ringan. Talk not of her. I never loved her. No! I thought I did, for she was prettiest: But having seen you I have seen the sun, And never more will languish for a star. Bellona. You are a foolish boy. Ringan. What shall I do? [Goes out. Annie. O, he has left me! O, my heart will break! Herminia. His haste forgot his love. You should not weep. Annie. It was not haste. These ladies! O, my heart! Clown. I told you what to look for. Bellona. Out on you!â Come, we'll devise a way to bring him back. [Mary-Jane, Bellona, and Annie go out. Clown follows. Antinous [singing]. The bee sucks honey from the flower Because the sweets are there: I love a maiden in her bower, Because the maiden's fair. The morning flower turns round his head To greet the rising sun; My love turns all to you, sweet maid, And so my song is done. [Antinous and Herminia go out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III SCENE.âA Garden. Enter Lady Montgomery and Captain Mercer. Mercer. I'm glad we've met. How long ago was that? Lady M. Since she was stolen it is fourteen years; Yet in that time no tears have wet my eyes: For when we knew the darling child was lost, My husband all his other hopes gave upâ His office, and advancement, whose sure strides Pursued him constantly, dogged as time; His friends and schemes political; his fame, Which years and dignity bore shoulder-high: He gave them all to buy this little pearl Whose price exceeds the value of the world. O, in our heart her dainty shape is shrined, And keeps it pulsing; and she goes not out Till wintry death expel her summer reign, And freeze that ruddy home to be his house. Mercer. Why, fourteen years ago I lost a wife, The sweetest girl that ever blessed a man. Some happy months, and then I crossed the seas: I sailed from Naples, and she went to Rome. When I returned my friends in Rome were gone, Whither I found not. Then my wife had died, I thought, in child-bed, and looked up the news. I did not there discover what I feared, But found in place a most conflicting tale Of brigandage; and murders had been done. Some ransomed, some let go, some corpses found, Left unaccounted for a child and woman. I searched until my purse and I were lank, In hope to find these two; then, back to sea. Having made many voyages and much wealth I still pursued my calling, for in it I found from sorrow, refuge; though, alone, In midnight watches I have often wept To hear the waves with melancholy tongues Lapping my ship, to see the crowded stars Rejoicing like a family in heaven. And so I marvel that you, being a woman, From weeping should refrain since love so great Beats in your heart for such a priceless loss. Lady M. The war of hope and fear made desolate The wine-press of our tears immediately; And since the imminence of our great loss, Our constant, wearisome world-wandering Has all unqualified our eyes for tears: I tell you we have gone through all the world. First every city, town, Italian croft, All hermitages, and all robbers' dens, From wintry Blanc to fiery Ãtna's base, We searched, or sharpened others' eyes with gold To ransack for our treasure: if two beings, Having between them for their inspiration One soul alone, might lose it, and yet move To seek their riven life, with wanner looks, With ghostlier, more eagle-sighted eyes, Than those with which we glanced through Italy, They could not pierce the region that they haunt: Obscurity was all revealed to us. Thereafter every morn a measured space Of weary world our gaunt eyes oversee: Round with the day from east to west we go. Twelve years, now past, from Rome we westward hied; And here, grown old, foot-sore, heart-sore, and poor In earthly gold, but rich in hope's bright coin We wander west again. Mercer. Most noble souls! You shall not lack for gold while I have wealth. O, you administer a chastisement To my unwinged proceedings in my search For wife and child, which should have distanced yours Who travel only for a daughter. Lady M. No; She is our niece, but loved more than a daughter. Mercer. I never heard, nor read, of such a love. Lady M. O, but you never saw, nor shall behold, So lovable a creature! I would more Lose her and pine for her than be the dame, The happy dame, of seven lusty boys Like any I have seenâthe loveliest. Mercer. What kin is she?âyour husband's or your own? Lady M. Her father was my husband's elder brother; His wife died when our little one was born. I reared her, loved her, and her infancy Laid hold upon my husband. Six years passed; And then her father wished her back again. Upon that news a sickness of my husband's Became a malady that claimed my care, Dividing so my grief. A worthy priest, Once chaplain to her father, leaving usâ We spent the summer in the Apenninesâ We trusted our one jewel to his care. But on the way a brigand regiment Killed him and others who would not submit. The captives being ransomed, she was missed, She and her nurse; and fourteen years reveal But little further light. Her father's dead; She is our ward; and we, her only friends. Mercer. What news is this! A woman and a child In both our stories unaccounted for! You spoke of further light. Lady M. Hope not too much. We met one, Julio, twice among the hills, Where he confessed he led the robber-band That wrought our woe; but of the nurse and child Professed whole innocence and ignorance. When he was captured and condemned to die He asked to see my husband. Penitent, He told him all he knew, a dreadful tale. While others plundered, he had marked a maid Who carried in her arms a lisping child: Seizing his fancy, her he laid hold upon; She struggled hard; he in his greedy hasteâ For though the leader, if he took her not And any other were possessed of her, He might not claim herâthe loud-screaming babe Tore from her, bent to kill; but on its breast, Its clothing being rent, there gleamed a cross Of gold, whereon in diamonds quaintly set Christ hung on ruby nails with ruby blood: It turned aside his purpose. Nigh them knelt Another woman, wringing of her hands, And weeping o'er another infant dead. Afraid to desecrate the symbol blest, He pressed the child, from early earthly death Saved by the cross, into this Rachel's arms, And swung the maid, discumbered harshly so, Upon his horse, and kept her for his own. The other woman with the cross-saved child Escaped, and took with her a store of gold. Mercer. This woman who escaped must be my wife: It is my wife! Resource was still her forte; By countless proofs her sleight of head she showed, Nor were her hands less cunning in their kind. I have not known in any clime of earth, Where trade constrained, or pleasure led me on, One of her sex likelier for such a deed As this checkmating of the brigand band: And with it all a girl most feminine; The deepest scrutiny would never dream What strength lay sleeping with an open eye Beneath her melting gaze and rosy mouth, Like fire that underburns a flowery mead. Pardon me, pray, I have not talked of her To any one alive for many years. Why she should travel in that company, Not leaving word, nor sending any news, I can but marvel. Lady M. Here my husband comes. Enter Sir James Montgomery. Sir James. News, news! Lady M. O heaven! Sir James. I'll tell you as we go. [They go out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV SCENE.âA Wood. Enter Edmund and May. May. Where is your bubbling mirth that overflowed In fresh, fantastic volume yester-eve? If doleful thoughts should shadow any face, My past might countenance such mirroring, And see, I laugh; yea, by all merry things Light-hearted am I! 'Tis the sun, I think. Why are you sad? If you still raise your brows, And stare so, like a spaniel, and unslack The pressure of your lips, I'll think, indeed, You mean to mimic my lost love, and steal With stolen looks my heart. Edmund. Am I like him? May. When you look sad you are, and when you laugh, I think he would have laughed so if he could. Edmund. You think him dead. May. Sometimes, and sometimes not. Edmund. Say you were certain of his death, what then? May. In weeds that widows wear I'd hide myself In some far lonely land, and mourn for him Among the hills and streams; and read his book; And, feeding seld and spare, woo fickle death, Who flirts with weaklings and bears off the strong, For one cold kiss to take my soul to him. Edmund. There is no man that's worthy of such love. May. I think not of his worth or want of worth; I love him. But if gentle manliness, Beauty, and honour, and unsounded passion Deserve a maid's devotion, my poor love Is but a scanty tribute to his worth; Andâwoe, alas!âits date of payment past, And the robbed creditor far hence or dead, Its garnered hoard weighs heavy on my heart. Edmund. Fear not, fear not. There's something whispers me Your love will be rewarded, in so far As to possess your sweetheart can amend The lengthy woe you suffer for his sake.â Now, here's a thing to do to make you glad. Suppose that I'm the true and true-loved earl: I'll go into that grove, and suddenly Emerging, light on you; and you will know me, Or I will know you, or we'll know each other, Or let our unthought act the instant mould. May. O, in his story there's a scene like that! I'm sitting reading in my sweetheart's book A passage where he finds me reading it. Edmund. A curious notion! May. Shall we act that scene? Edmund. Yes, if you please. But have you got the book? May. Yes; here it is. Now hide; and I will change To suit the place the passage. Edmund. Very well. [Goes out. May [reading]. âNow it chanced that May Montgomery was resident in this town at the very time of Edmund's arrival. One afternoon the love-sick girl took her book to the glen, and sitting down in the shadow of a tree endeavoured to alleviate her passion by reading aloud the scene wherein her lover had represented her in just such a situation, and so engaged. She had read over the description of herself lying on her mossy couch, and her cheek was flushed with the anticipation of the interview about to ensue in the narrative between her lover and herself, when the branches rustled behind her and a voiceââ Edmund [within]. May Montgomery! May. O Heaven! Deceitful ears! ââand a voice whispered âMay Montgomery.â She accused her fancy of cheating her, and proceeded with her readingââ Edmund [within]. May Montgomery! May. O me! this voice is agonising! Fancy, you will make me mad! ââwhen the voice again whispered her name. She exclaimed on fancy for torturing her so, and laying the book upon the ground, was about to stretch herself, leaning on her elbows with her fingers in her ears, when a shadow cameââ Good my eyes have you leagued with my ears, then? There is a shadow! Oh! Re-enter Edmund. Edmund. Turn not away. Your hands late held my book. Take now the hand That wrote the book. May. Are you a ghost, a ghoul, A vampire, come to plague me for my sin In killing him with scorn whose form you bear? I beg no mercy, for the doom is just. But no; you are an angel; it must be: No spirit foul could harbour in your shade: And you have come to tell me I'm forgiven. Edmund. I'm neither ghost, nor ghoul, nor angel, May: I am your lover in carnation true, A bodiment much better than of yore, Edmund, with health restored and joy complete, Since it is crowned with what he never hoped, The freely-given diadem of your love. May. I think you surely are the devil, sir. This acting is too good: you're like him too. Edmund. Him!âwhom?âthe devil? May. O, no! Earl Edmund.âLove, I know you now. [He offers to embrace her. No, sir; I will go to the grave unkissed by any man, if I do not find the true Earl Edmund. I think I must begin and search for him. I wait and wait, and time is all that comes and goes. When I think that on every hour I bestow a treasure of hope, and that some day I may have entertained so many hours as to have spent all my fortune in that kind; and when I remember that all this expense may be waste, for my love may be in heaven; and when I think that if he be alive every hour removes my memory further from him; that he may love another, that he may be married, then I cling to the skirts of every parting hour, and sigh at the knell that tolls its departure and the advent of the next.â But let us act again.â O yes, I know you, Edmund, and I love you. But can you then forgive me for my scorn? Edmund. Forgiveâforgive? There's nothing to forgive. May. O, I was very foolish, very young! I did not know how great a thing love is: That woman's love is like the spacious sea, And man's love like the mirroring of the sky. O, I knew nothing! Yet, I should have known. Now, I know all; your book has been my school, My manual, my cyclopÃ¦dia: It tells me of the all in all of love, And teaches that its soul cannot be told, That action is its highest eloquence. Edmund. The silence of your lips, my gentle love, Is richer, rosier, than the ruddiest gold; The diamonds and the rubies of your speech Become them well. May. You act too warmly, sir. Edmund. I do not act at all; I am myself. May. Nay, then, I think you are beside yourself. Be moderate, sir.âYou uttered only words; And words are breath; and then, a lover's breath! Hot, gasping, poisonous air! Edmund. O no, my May! Love's breath is hot and healthy as the breeze That floats the summer from the sunny south, With merry crews of nightingales and swallows, As sweet and swift as are the words of love. May. O words and songs and sounds are merely stones, When love is as an empty hungry gulf. Edmund. Ay, but when love is certain of a feast, Then words and songs and sounds are spicy whets. May. Yes, yes; dear love, dear love. Speak on, speak on. Edmund. Say after me what I will say to you, The words that are the sweetest in the world, And are an act when all a soul is in them. You are the cause that makes me whisper them, And, being said, from you claim like effect. If what I say be of such worth to you, As, said by you, 'twill hold in my esteem, Then this will be a changing gold for gold: I love you. May. I love you. Edmund. The only words Worth learning, speaking, writing, singing, graving. The middle word, the linking word, the âloveâ Is like eternal space; and âIâ and âyouâ Mark out a sky and earth, and gather in Time, heaven, and hell. May. O, happiness alone! We hedge about an Eden, I and you. Edmund. Eden, indeed! Adam I envy not His grand originality; for when I say to you, âSweet May Montgomery, I love you,â I speak words I seem to make. As sweet and strange they are as when first said By Adam when he first beheld his Eve. I feel within, about me, and above The freshness of creation. Everything Is new, and every word a white-hot poem: I am a poet, too, as great as Adam; To speak, as in his time, is to invent. âI,â âyouââO, these are words new-forged and bright! And herein am I happier than heâ I love, not Eve, but May Montgomery. May. O me! I would that I could find my love! You are in love, too, for your speech betrays you. Pray, tell me of your love; I told you mine. Edmund. Not now; the hour is past. Come; we must run. How they will mock us! May. We've been happy, though. [They go out, running.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V SCENE. The Alley of Sighs A table set out. Enter Clown and Bellona. Clown. O Amazon, victorious and proud, More dread than is your bow your eyebrows are, Upbending to discharge darts keener far Than fill your quiver or the thunder-cloud. You jest at me, you mock my heartfelt love; You put me off and on even as a glove. O gentle, noble, bitter amazon, I would that you could see into my heart! Bellona. I've seen; it is an empty nut, good clown. Clown. Thenceforward I will play a silent part. Enter Mary-Jane. Bellona. What is to be done? Mary-Jane. Herminia is dressing Annie Smith like a bride in satin and lace; and she and Antinous will lead her into the presence of the mad boy, whom we are to have here. As it was our dresses as much as our maturity that caught his fancy, I have no doubt that, mistaking Annie for a new goddess, he will fall at her feet with some hyperbolical apostrophe, as he did at yours. Bellona. A very likely thing. I hope he may not recognise her.âClown. Clown. Your will? Bellona. Fetch hither Ringan Deane. Clown. Where is he? Bellona. Find him. [Clown goes out. Mary-Jane. Have you two quarrelled? Bellona. O no! He's a patient, strong man, that clown. Mary-Jane. He's a handsome fellow. Bellona. I have eyes. Enter Edmund and May Montgomery. May [aside]. We're not the last: we're safe from mockery. Edmund. Why, where are all the rest, good amazon? Bellona. Why, where's your wondrous plot, good earl? Edmund. Fate knows. Bellona. Fate!âhow you startle me! I brooded once On destiny, and thus said with myself: I will not do as other women do, Marry a man, and be one couple more; I will not be as other women are, Whom the world praises, and who deem themselves Happy as earth can make them: I will be Unwomanly, and scorn what women love. Edmund. A new Diana. Bellona. No, a thousand times! Why will you think what may be must have been? My thoughtâBut I'll not tell you; for to tell Would kill it; then I could not give it shape. Always I read of fate and talked of it, Of birth-stars, and our own polarity, And of the orient, iron dooms-day book, Of former lives that we have led, whose deeds Determine this, of unrelenting lifeâ The ecstasy that with the flowers we share, The crisis that for ever shakes the world; And I would ebb and flow with hope and fear, But mostly breast the adamant with waves Of seething blood, I curbed, I quelledâHow's this? You spoke of fate, and struck a resonant string. Edmund. Then, you're a fatalist. Bellona. I fear I am. Edmund. You speak more truly than you think. Your fear Is just; for brooding souls that talk of fate, And of their helpless, brute plasticity In mighty, thoughtless hands, bring down the woes They dread and should defy: the timid blood Is first to be diseased; and wingÃ¨d death Falls on the shrinking quarry. Amazon, Face fate and stare it down. Why, this is fate, This only: other slave we cannot have Than these same hands and feet of circumstance. Master it, master it; or fire and flood Are drowned and scorched like moths and drops of dew! The Arab fisher's jinn; unsealed, diffused, He fills and suffocates the universe; Inurned, a plaything, or a marshalled host. You see, I know the western prophet, too. May. O, let us lie and talk of love and fate Here on the daisies till the night comes down! Enter Sir James and Lady Montgomery, and Captain Mercer. Mary-Jane [aside]. My husband! O, what shall I do? Lady M. Alas, She is not here! Mercer. My wife is; that is she. Edmund. You watch us keenly. Sir James. We have reason, sir. Mary-Jane [kneeling before Mercer]. Forgive me. Kneel beside me, May; kneel down. [May kneels. [To May.] Give me your hand, andâkiss me. May. Mother, mother! What is it? Bellona. Now, I think, the play begins. Mary-Jane. They killed my baby; and they gave me her. Look at her, feel her!âcould I give her up? Sirâmadam!â May. Mother, mother! Mary-Jane. Husband! May. Hush, Or you will die. Mercer. Dear love, dear soul, dread nothing. [Raises Mary-Jane. Bellona [aside]. Herminia comes.âGood people, who are caught In this same net of circumstance, go hence: Pass through these birches, and you'll find a bower Whose shade will blend more sweetly with your mood, And make serener your enraptured souls. Besides, I am the prompter, or the fate Of one scene more fantastic than you play, Which falls now to be acted here. Sir James. Lady, Your garb does not bespeak your wisdom. Bellona. Sir, Since when had decency sole grant of sense? Edmund. Well said! Sir James. I'll set my wits to yours anon. Is this the way? Bellona. Under the lowest boughs. [Sir James and Lady Montgomery, Mercer, Edmund, Mary-Jane and May go out. Enter Antinous and Herminia with Annie Smith dressed like a bride. Bellona. Ah, keep that look, sweet child! The mystery Of sense and soul! Her eyes are infinite. Herminia, what would not you and I, Maids as we are, and infants yet in law, Surrender thankfully to own again The dream of innocence? Herminia. My beautyâay, Half of my beauty for the dewy dawn, The fragrance, and the shadow of heaven, the blood That knows not what it would, bathing the thought With odorous tides, the rapture of life, the swoon Of innocence, the infinite longing, The sweet pain, and a pure, brave boy to love me! Antinous, we shall please ourselves with this, And play at being a boy and girl again. Antinous. My love, you are happier in this fantasy Than when you were the thing and knew it not. Herminia. And I believe you. Bellona. Here they come. Sit, child. Annie Smith sits on a knoll. Herminia and Bellona lie on either side of her. Antinous stands behind. Enter Clown with Ringan Deane. Ringan. What deity is this? whose bride? whose queen? Look, how she sits among these earthly maids, A star between two lamps. She looks at me With eyes like beckoning flames. A kind of night Hovers about her, she so dazzles day. She bends toward me; she stretches out her arms; A tear, a molten tear wells in each eye, And overhangs the lid and slowly falls, Loth to descend these tender wistful heavens. Her lips are open, but her struggling voice, A helpless, still-born sigh, dies in her mouth. I hope I may have strength to speak to her. [He kneels before Annie Smith. Annie. O RinganâRingan Deane! Ringan. You know me, then! Annie [embracing him]. O, Ringan, I am AnnieâAnnie Smith! Bellona. Clown, this is very well. I am so moved; I feel a kindliness to all the world. Clown. And I am of the world. Bellona. Ay, so you are. Re-enter Sir James, Lady Montgomery, and the others. Bellona. Well, noble earl? What!âwonders? Edmund. Yes, indeed, Most wonderful. Bellona. Sit, then, and tell us. See, The feast is spread. Edmund. We'll tell you when we sit; But there's a thing to do before we sit.â Ladies and gentlemen, a little way We've stepped beyond convention. I propose A further deviation from the path Beaten by ages, dusty with the trade Of thronging use and wont. The Scottish law Permits us here to marry as we are: Let us be marriedâare we not all paired? And this same feast shall be our wedding-feast. Do you object, Sir James? Sir James. Why should I, sir? Edmund. Then, May Montgomery, will you know me yet? May. I am in a dream. One mystery at a time. However came you by my proper name? Edmund. That is the strangest accident of all: I was a prophet when I wrote my book.â Sweet May Montgomery, I take you for my wife In sight of heaven and you, astonished friends. May. I take you for my husband. Antinous. I take you, Herminia, for my wife. Herminia. And I take you, Antinous, for my husband. [Aside to Ant.] Dear old Jack. Bellona. My name is Mary Jones. Clown. So? Ha! Then I, James Jocelyn, take you to be my wife. Bellona. I love you, and I take you for my husband. Mercer. My dearest wife, you'll be my bride again? Mary-Jane. Surely, my husband. Sir James.
