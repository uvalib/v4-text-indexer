      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. Enter Brennoralt, Doran. Brennoralt. I say, the Court is but a narrow circuit; Though somthing elevate above the common; A kind of Ants nest in the great wilde field, O're charg'd with multitudes of quick Inhabitants, Who still are miserably busied to get in, What the loose foot of prodigality, As fast do's throw abroad. Dor. Good: A most eternall place of low affronts, And then as low submissions. Bren. Right. High cowards in revenges 'mongst themselves, And only valiant when they mischiefe others. Dor. Stars, that would have no names, But for the ills they threaten in conjunction. Bren. A race of shallow, and unskilfull Pilots; Which doe misguide the Ship even in the calme, And in great stormes serve but as weight to sinke it. More, prethee more.â (Alarum within. 'Tis musique to my melancholy. Enter Souldier. Sold. My Lord; a cloud of dust and men The Sentinels from th'East gate discover; And as they guesse, the storme bends this way. Bren. Let it be. Sold. My Lord?â Bren. Let it be, I will not fight to day: Bid Stratheman draw to the trenches. On, prethee on. Dor. The King imployes a company of formall beards, Men, who have no other proofes of their Long life, but that they are old. Bren. Right, and if th'are wise, 'Tis for themselves, not others.â (Alarum. As old men ever are. Enter second Soldier. 2 Sold. Coronell, Coronell; Th'enemies at hand, kils all the Centries: Young Almerin leads them on agen. Bren. Let him lead them off agen. 2 Sold. Coronell.â Bren. Be gone. If th'art afraid, goe hide thy selfe. 2 Sold. What a Divell ayles he?â (Exit. Bren. This Almerin's the ague of the Camp: He shakes it once a day. Dor. Hee's the ill conscience rather: He never lets it rest; would I were at home agen. 'Sfoot we lie here i'th' trenches, as if it were For a winde to carry us into th'other World: every houre we expectâ I'le no more on't. Bre. Pretheeâ Dor. Not I, by heaven. Bre. What man! the worst is but faire death. Dor. And what will that amount to? A faire Epitaph. A fine account.âI'le home I sweare. Enter Stratheman. Stra. Arme, arme my Lord, And shew your selfe, all's lost else. Dor. Why so? Stra. The Rebels like an unruly floud, Rowle o're the trenches, and throw downe All before them. Bre. Ha? Stra. We cannot make a stand. Bre. He would out-rivall me in honour too, As well as love; but that he must not doe. Help me Strathman.â (Puts on Armour. The danger now growes worthy of our swords; And, oh Doran, I would to heaven there were No other stormes then the worst tempest here. (Exeunt. Enter Marinell, throwing downe one he carries. Mari. There; The Sun's the nearest Surgeon I know, And the honestest; if thou recoverest, why so: If not, the cure's paid, they have mauld us. Enter Grainevert, with another upon his backe. Grain. A curse light on this powder; It stayes valour, ere it's halfe way on it's journey: What a disadvantage fight we upon in this age? He that did well heretofore, Had the broad faire day to shew it in: Witnesses enough; we must beleeve one anotherâ 'Tis night when we begin: Eternall smoake and sulpher. Smalke; by this hand I can beare with thee No longer; how now? dead as I live; Stolne away just as he us'd to wench. Well goe thy wayes, for a quiet drinker, and dier, I shall never know thy fellow: (searches his pockets. These trifles too about thee? There was never an honester poore wretch Borne I thinkeâlook i'th' tother pocket tooâhum, Marinell. Mar. Who's that? Grani. 'Tis I; how goes matters? Mar. Scurvily enough; Yet since our Colonell came, th'ave got no ground Of us; A weake Sculler against Winde and Tide, Would have done as much, harke: This way the torrent beares. Exeunt. Enter Fresolin, Almerin, Rebels. Fres. The Villaines all have left us. Alm. Would they had left their feares Behind them. But come, since we mustâ Enter Brennoralt, Souldiers. Bren. Hoe! Stratheman; Skirt on the left hand with the horse, And get betwixt these and that Body; They'r new rallied up for rescue. Dor. Th'are ours. Brennoralt charges through. I doe not see my game yet.â Exeunt. A shout within. Enter Brennoralt, Doran, Stratheman, Marinell. Bren. What shout is that? Stra. They have taken Almerin, my Lord. Bren. Almerin? the Divell thanke 'em for't: When I had hunted hard all day, And now at length unhearded the proud Deere, The Currs have snatch't him up, sound a Retreat: There's nothing now behinde. Who saw Doran? Str. Shall we bring Almerin in? Bre. No; gazing is low Triumph: Convey him fairely to the King, He fought it fairelyâ Dor. What youth was that, whom you bestrid my Lord, And sav'd from all our swords to day? Was he not of the Enemy? Bre. It may be soâ Str. The Governors Son, Fresolin, his Mistris brother. (In Dorans eare) Br. No matter who. 'Tis pitty, the rough hand Of warre, should early courages destroy, Before they bud, and shew themselves i'th' heate Of Actionâ Mar. I threw (my Lord) a youth upon a banke; Which seeking, after the retreate, I found Dead, and a woman, the pretty daughter Of the Forrester; Lucillia. Bre. See, see Doran; A sad experiment: Woman's the cowardly'st and coldest thing The world brings forth: Yet Love, as fire works water, Makes it boyle o're, and doe things contrary To'ts proper natureâI should shed a teare, Could I tell howâAh poore Lucilia! Thou didst for me what did as ill become thee. Pray see her gently bury'dâ Boy, send the Surgeon to the Tent; I bleed: What lowsie Cottages th'ave given our soules? Each petty storme shakes them into disorder; And 't costs more paines to patch them up agen, Then they are worth by much. I'm weary of The Tenement.â Exeunt. Enter Villanor, Grainevert, Marinell, and Stratheman. Gra. Villanor! welcome, welcome, whence camest thou? Vil. Looke, I weare the Kings high way still on my boots. Gra. A pretty riding phrase, and how? and how? Ladies cheap? Vil. Faith, reasonable: Those toyes were never deare thou know'st; A little time and industry they'l cost; But in good faith not much: some few there are That set themselves at mighty ratesâ Gra. Which we o'th' wise passe by, As things o're-valued in the market. Is't not so? Vil. Y'have said Sir, Harke you, your friend the Rivals married. Has obtain'd the long lov'd Lady, and is such an asse after't. Gra. Hum. 'Tis ever so. The motions of married people, are as of Other naturals; violent Gentlemen to the place, And calme in it. Mar. We know this too; and yet we must be fooling. Gra. Faith, women are the baggage of life: They are troublesome, and hinder us In the great march, and yet we cannot Be without 'em. Mar. You speake very well, And Souldier-like. Grain. What? thou art a wit too I warrant, In our absence? Vil. Humâno, no, a poore pretender, A Candidate or so, 'gainst the next Sessions: Wit enough to laugh at you here. Gra. Like enough; valour's a crime: The wise have still reproached unto the valiant, And the fooles too. Vil. Raillerie a part, Grainvert; What accommodations shall we finde here? Gra. Cleane straw (sweet-heart) and meat When thou canst get it. Vil. Hum? straw? Gra. Yes. That's all will be betwixt Incest: You, and your mother earth must lye together. V. Prethee let's be serious; will this last? How goes affaires? G. Well. V. But well? G. Faith, 'tis now upon the turning of the ballance: A most equall businesse, betwixt Rebellion And Loyaltie. V. What doest meane? G. Why; which shall be the vertue, and which the vice. V. How the Divell can that be? G. Oh: successe is a rare paint; hides all the uglines. V. Prethee, what's the quarrell? G. Nay, for that excuse us; Aske the children of peace. They have the leisure to study it, We know nothing of it; Liberty they say. V. 'Sfoot, let the King make an Act, That any man may be unmarried agen; There's liberty for them. A race Of half-witted fellowes quarrell about freedome? And all that while allow the bonds of Matrimony? G. You speake very well Sir. Enter King, Lords, Brennoralt. M. Soft; the King and Councellâ G. Looke, they follow after like tyred spannels: Quest sometimes for company; that is, concurre: And that's their busines. M. They are as weary of this sport As a young unthrift of's land: Any bargaine to be rid on't. V. Can you blame them?â Who's that? M. Brennoralt, our brave Coronell: A discontent, but, what of that? who is not? V. His face speaks him one. G. Thou art i'th' right. He looks still as if he were saying to Fortune; Huswife, goe about your busines. Come, let's retire to Barathens Tent. Taste a bottle, and speake bold truths; That's our way now. Ex. Manet King and Lords. Mies. âThinke not of pardon Sir, Rigor and mercy us'd in States uncertainly, And in ill times, looke not like th'effects Of vertue, but necessity: Nor will They thanke your goodnes, but your feares.â Melid. My Lords; Revenge in Princes should be still imperfect: It is then handsom'st, when the King comes to Reduce, not Ruineâ Bre. Who puts but on the face of punishing, And only gently cuts, but prunes rebellion: He makes that flourish which he would destroy. Who would not be a Rebell when the hopes Are vaste the feares but small? [Mel.] Why, I would not. Nor you my Lord, nor yon, nor any here. Feare keeps low spirits only in, the brave Doe get above it, when they doe resolve. Such punishments in infancy of warre, Make men more desperate, not the more yeelding. The common people are a kind of flyes; They're caught with honey, not with wormewood, Sir. Severity exasp'rates the stirr'd humour; And State distempers turnes into diseases. Bre. The gods forbid, great Polands State should be Such as it dares not take right Physick. Quarter To Rebels? Sir! when you give that to them, Give that to me, which they deserve. I would Not live to see itâ 3 Lord. Turne o're your owne, and other Chronicles, And you shall finde (great Sir) âThat nothing makes a Civill warre long liv'd, âBut ransome and returning backe the brands Which unextinct, kindled still fiercer fires. Mies. Mercy bestow'd on those that doe dispute With swords, do's loose the Angels face it has, And is not mercy Sir, but policie; With a weake vizard onâ King. âY'have met my thoughts My Lords; nor will it need larger debate. To morrow, in the sight of the besiedg'd, The Rebell dyes: Miesla, 'tis your care. The mercy of Heav'n may be offended so, That it cannot forgive: Mortals much more, Which is not infinite, my Lords. (Exeunt. Enter Iphigene, Almerin (as in prison.) Iph. O Almarin; would we had never knowne The ruffle of the world! but were againe By Stolden banks, in happy solitude; When thou and I, Shepheard and Shepheardesse; So oft by turnes, as often still have wisht, That we as eas'ly could have chang'd our sex, As clothes; but (alas!) all those innocent joyes, Like glorious Mornings, are retir'd into Darke sullen clouds, before we knew to value What we had. [Alme.] Fame &amp; victory are light (to himself. Huswifes, that throw themselves into the armes, Not of the valiant, but the fortunate. To be tane, thus! [Iph.] Almerin [Alm.] nipt 'ith' bud Of honour! [Iph.] My Lord [Alm.] Foil'd! &amp; by the man That doe's pretend unto Francelia! Iph. What is't you doe, my Almerin? sit still? And quarrell with the Winds, because there is A shipwrack tow'rds and never thinke of saving The barke? [Almer.] The Barke? What should we doe with that When the rich freight is lost: my name in armes? Iph. âWho knowes What prizes are behind, if you attend And waite a second Voyage? [Almer:] Never, never: There are no second Voyages in this, The wounds of honour doe admit no cure. Iph. Those slight ones which misfortune gives, must needs. Else, why should Mortals value it at all? For who would toyle to treasure up a wealth; Which weake inconstancy did keep, or might Dispose of?â Enter Melidor. Oh my Lord, what newes? Mel.

Opportunity to States-men, is as the just degree Of heate to Chymistsâit perfects all the worke, And in this pris'ner 'tis offer'd. We now are there, where men should still begin; To treate upon advantage. The Palatine of Trocke, and Mensecke, With Almerin, shall to the King; Petitions shall be drawne, Humble in forme, but such for matter, As the bold Macedonian youth would send To men he did despise for luxury. The first begets opinion of the world, Which looks not far, but on the outside dwels: Th'other inforces courage in our owne, For bold demands must boldly be maintain'd. Pal. Let all goe on still in the publique name, But keep an eare open to particular offers; Liberty and publique good are like great Oleos Must have the uper end still of our tables, Though they are but for shew. Fra. Would I had ne're seen this shape, 't has poyson in't, Yet where dwells good, if ill inhabits there? Min. âPresse much religion, For though we dresse the scruples for the multitude, And for our selves reserve th'advantages, (It being much pretext) yet is it necessary; For things of faith are so abstruse, and nice, They will admit dispute eternally: So how so e're other demands appeare, These never can be prov'd unreasonable; The subject being of so fine a nature, It not submits it selfe to sense, but scapes The trials which conclude all common doubts. Fra. My Lord, you use me as ill Painters paint, Who while they labour to make faces faire, Neglect to make them like. Iphi. Madam, there is no shipwracke of your Vertues neare, that you should throw away Any of all your excellencies To save the dearest, modesty. Gener.

If they refuse us wholy, then we plead, The King's besiedged, blockt up so straightly By some few, reliefe can find no way To enter to the King, or to get out to us, Exclaime against it loud, Till the Polonians thinke it high injustice, And wish us better yet. Then easily do we rise unto our ends. And will become their envy through their pitty. At worst you may confirme our party there: Increase it too: there is one Brennoralt, Men call him Gallant, but a discontent: My Cosen the King hath us'd him ill. Him a handsome whisper will draw. The afternoone shall perfect What we have loosely now resolv'd.â Iphi. If in discourse of beauty, (So large an Empire) I do wonder, It will become your goodnesse Madam, To set me right. And in a country where you your selfe is Queene, Not suffer strangers loose themselves. Gener. What, making revenges Palatine? And taking prisoners faire Ladies hearts? Iphi. Yes my Lord. And have no better fortune in this Warre, Then in the other; for while I thinke to take, I am surprized my selfe. Fra. Dissembler, would thou wert. M. You are a Courtier my Lord; The Palatine of Plocence, (Almerin) Will grace the Hymeneals; And that they may be while his stay is here, I'le court my Lord in absence; Take off for you the little strangenesses Virgins weare at first,â (Iphe sounds.

If't were impossible, it should be otherwise, What can you imagine there of Constancy? Where 'tis so much their nature to love change, That when they say but what they are, They excuse themselves for what they doe? Bren. She hardly knowes him yet, in such an instant. Dor. Oh you know not how fire flies, When it does catch light matter, woman. B. No more of that; She is Yet the most precious thing in all my thoughts. If it be soâ (Studies.) I am a lost thing in the world Doran. D. How? Bren. Thou wilt in vaine perswade me to be other Life, which to others is a Good that they Enjoy, to me will be an evill, I Shall suffer inâ Dor. Looke on another face, that's present remedy. Bren. How ill thou doest conclude? 'Cause there are pestilent ayres, which kill men suddenly In health, must there be soveraigne as suddenly, To cure in sicknes? 't never was in nature. Exit, and Enters againe hastily. Bren. I was a foole to thinke, Death only kept The doores of ill-pay'd love, when or disdaine, Or spite could let me out as wellâ Dor. Right; were I as you, It should no more trouble me To free my selfe of love, Then to spit out that which made me sicke. Bren. Ile tell her so; that she may laugh at me, As at a prisoner threatning his Guard, He will breake loose, and so is made the faster. She hath charmes.â (Studies) Doran can fetch in a rebellious heart, Ev'n while it is conspiring liberty. âOh she hath all The vertues of her sexe, and not the vices, Chaste and unsullied, as first op'ning Lillies, Or untouch'd budsâ Dor. Chaste? why! do you honour me, Because I throw my selfe not off a precipice? 'Tis her ruine to be otherwise; Though we blame those that kill themselves (my Lord) We praise not him that keeps himselfe alive, And deserves nothing. Bren. And 'tis the least. She doe's triumph, when she doe's but appeare: I have as many Rivals as beholders. Dor. All that encreases but our jealousies; If you have now such qualmes for that you have not, What will you have for that you shall possesse? Bren. âDull hÃ¦ritique; Know I have these, because I have not her: When I have her, I shall have these no more. Her fancy now, her vertue then will governe: And as I use to watch with doubtfull eye, The wavering needie in the best Sun-dyall, Till it has setled, then the trouble's o're, Because I know when it is Fixt, it's True: So here my doubts are all afore me. Sure, Doran, crown'd Conquerours are but the types Of Lovers, which enjoy, and really Possesse, what th'other have in dreames. I'le send A challenge to him.â Dor. Do, and be thought a mad-man. To what purpose? If shee love him, shee will but hate you more. Lovers in favour (Brennoralt) are Gamesters In good fortune; the more you set them, The more they get. Bren. I'le see her then this night, by Heaven I will. Dor. Where? in the Cittadell? Bren. Know what, and why.â Dor. He raves, Brennoralt? Bren. Let me alone.â I conjure thee, by the discretion Left betwixt us, (that's thine, For mine's devour'd by injuries of fortune,) Leave me to my selfe. Dor. I have done. Bren. Is there such a passage, As thou hast told me of, into the Castle? Rag. There is my Lord. Bren. And dar'st thou let me in? Rag. If you my Lord will venture. Bren. There are no Centry's neare it. Rag. None. Bren. How to the chamber afterward? Rag. Her woman. Bren. What's shee? Rag. A wicket to my Ladies secrets, One that stands up to marriage with me. Bren. Thereâupon thy life be secret.â (flings a purse. Rag. Else,âAll punishment to ingratitude.â Bren. Enough, I am a storme within till I am there, Oh Doran! That that, which is so pleasant to behold, Should be such paine within! Dor. Poore Brennoralt! Thou art the Martyr of a thousand tyrants: Love, Honour, and Ambition raigne by turnes, And shew their power upon thee. Bren. Why, let them; I'm still Brennoralt: âEv'n Kings âThemselves, are by their servants rul'd sometimes; âLet their own slaves govern them at odde houres: âYet not subject their Persons or their Powers.

And now forc't by necessity, like Catts In narrow roomes, they fly up in your face? Thinke you Rebellion and Loyalty Are empty names? and that in Subjects hearts They don't both give, and take away the courage? Shall we beleeve there is no difference In good and bad? that there's no punishment, Or no protection? forbid it Heaven! If when great Polands honour, safety too, Hangs in dispute, we should not draw our Swords, Why were we ever taught to weare 'em Sir? Mi. This late commotion in your Kingdom Sir, Is like a growing Wen upon the face, Which as we cannot looke one but with trouble, So take't away we cannot but with danger. War there hath foulest face, and I most feare it Where the pretence is fair'st. Religion And Liberty, most specious names, they urge; Which like the Bils of subtle Mountebankes, Fill'd with great promises of curing all, âThough by the wise, Pass'd by unread as common cosenage, Yet, By th'unknowing multitude they're still Admir'd, and flock't unto.â K. Is there no way To disabuse them? [Melid] All is now too late. âThe vulgar in Religion are like âUnknown Lands; those that first possesse them, have them. Then, Sir, consider, justnesse of Cause is nothing: When things are risen to the point they are; 'Tis either not examin'd or beleev'd Among the Warlike.â The better cause the Grecians had of Yore, Yet were the Gods themselves divided in't; And the foule ravisher found as good protection As the much injur'd husband.â Nor are you Sir assur'd of all behinde you: For though your Person in your Subjects hearts Stands highly honour'd, and belov'd, yet are There certaine Acts of State, which men call grievances Abroad; and though they bare them in the times Of peace, yet will they now perchance, seeke to Be free, and throw them off. âFor know Dread Sir, âThe Common People are much like the Sea, âThat suffers things to fall and sinke unto âThe bottome in a Calme, which in a Storme âStird and inraged, it lifts, and does keep up Then; Time distempers cures more safely Sir, Then Physick does, or instant letting-bloud: Religion now is a young Mistris there, For which each man will fight, and dye at least; Let it alone a while, and 'twill become A kind of marry'd wife: people will be Content to live with it in quietnesse. (If that at least may be) my voyce is therefore Sir, For Peace.â Mies. Were Sir the question simply War or Peace, It were no more then shortly to be askt, Whether we would be well or ill: Since War the sicknesse of the Kingdome is, And Peace the health: But here I do conceive 'Twill rather lye, whether we had not better, Endure sharpe sicknesse for a time, to enjoy A perfect strength, then have it languish on us: For Peace and War in an incestuous line, Have still begot each other.â Those men that highly now have broke all Lawes, (The great one only 'tis 'twixt man and man) What safety can they promise, though you give it? Will they not still suspect, (and justly too) That all those civill bonds (new made) should be Broken againe to them? so being still In feares and jealousies themselves, they must Infect the People: âFor in such a case âThe private safety is the publike trouble.

Lord. In entring phisique, I thinke, Sir, none so much considers The Doctors face, as his owne body. To keep on foot the warre with all your wants, Is to let bloud, and take strong potions, In dangerous sicknesse. K. I see, and wonder not to finde, my Lords, This difference in opinion; the subject's large: Nor can we there too much dispute, where when We erre, 'tis at a Kingdomes charges; Peace And warre are in themselves indifferent, And time doth stamp them either good or bad: But here the place is much considerable; âWarre in our owne is like to too much heate âWithin, it makes the body sicke; when in âAnother Countrey, 'tis but exercise; âConveighs that heat abroad, and gives it health. To that I bend my thoughts; but leave it to Our greater Councell, which we now assemble: Meane time exchange of pris'ners only we Assent untoâ Lord. Nothing of Truce Sir? [K.] No: wee'l not take up Quiet at int'rest: Perfect Peace, or nothing. âCessations for short times in warre, are like âSmall fits of health, in desp'rate maladies: âWhich while the instant paine seemes to abate, âFlatters into debauch and worse estate.â Exeunt.

Yes, that Iphigene Though showne as man unto the world, Was woman, excellent womanâ Bren. I understand no riddles guard thee.â Fight and pause. Alm. O could they now looke downe, And see how wee two strive Which first should give revenge, They would forgive us something of the crime. Hold prethee give me leave To satisfie a curiosityâ I never kissed my Iphigene as woman. Bren. Thou motion'st well, nor have I taken leave (Rising. It keeps a sweetnesse yetâ As stills from Roses, when the flowers are gone. Alm. Even so have two faint Pilgrims scorch't with heat Vnto some neighbour fountaine stept aside Kneel'd first, then laid their warm lips to the Nymph And from her coldnesse took fresh life againe As we doe nowâ Bren. Lets on our journy if thou art refresht. Alm. Come and if there be a place reserved For heightned spirits better then other, May that which wearies first of ours have it. Fight agood while Alm. fals. Bren. If I grow weary, laugh at me, that's all Alm. âBrave soules above which will Be (sure) inquisitive for newes from earth Shall get no other but that thou art Brave. Enter King: Stratheman: Lords: Minse. Stra. To preserve some Ladies as we guest. King. Still gallant, Brennoralt, thy sword not sheath'd yet? Busie still?â Bren. Revenging Sir The fowlest murder ever blasted eares Committed here by Almerin and Iphigene. Alm. False, false; The first created purity Was not more innocent then Iphigene. Bren. Lives he agen? Alm. Stay thou much wearied guest Till I have thrown a truth amongst themâ We shall look back else to posterity. King. What sayes he? Lord. Some thing concerning this he labours to Discover. Alm. Know it was I that kild Francelia? I aloneâ Mins. O barbarous return of my civilities Was it thy hand? Alm. Heare and forgive me Minse Entring this morning hastily With resolution to preserve The faire Francelia. I found a theefe Stealing the treasure (as I thought) Belongd to me. Wild in my mind As ruin'd in my honour, in much mistaken rage I wounded both: then (oh) too late I found My errour. Found Iphigene a woman Acting stolne love, to make her own love safe And all my jealousies impossible Whilst I ran out to bring them cure; Francelia dies; and Iphigene found here I can no moreâ (dies) King. Most strange and intricate. Iphigene a woman? Mel. With this story I am guiltily acquainted The first concealments, since her love And all the wayes to it I have bin trusted with: But Sir my greife joyn'd with the instant busines Begges a deferrement. King. I am amaz'd till I doe heare it out. âBut ith' mean time, Least in these mists merit should loose it selfe, âThose forfeitures Of Trock and Menseck and Brennoralt are thine. Bren. A Princely guilt! But Sir it comes too late. Like Sun-beames on the blasted blossomes, doe Your favours fall: you should have giv'n me this When't might have rais'd me in mens thoughts, and made Me equall to Francelia's love: I have No end, since shee is notâ Back, to my private life I will returne. âCattell, though weary, can trudge homewards, after. King. This melancholy, time must cure: Come take The bodies up, and lead the prisoners on, Triumph and funerals must walke together, Cipresse and Laurell twin'd make up one chaplet. âFor we have got The day; but bought it at so deare a rate, That victory it selfe's unfortunate.
