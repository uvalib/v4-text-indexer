      <field name="fulltext">Act. I. Scen. I. After a Warlike sound of Drummes and Trumpets within; Enter Callias, Neander, Artops. Call. Here's a sweet change of Times; I, who had wont To have my boy sing me asleep between My Mistresse Armes, and charme mee every Night Ino a soft Elysium with his voyce. Have beene this weeke kept waking with this Musick: If this hold foure dayes more, I shall be fit, Like Blackbirds, to be whistled to, and taught, Out of meere tamenesse, to learne Tunes. Neand: I doe Observe a certaine kind of Copulation Twixt sound and sound. This noyse hath sexes in it. The Drummers, and the Trumpetters, and Fifes, Make the Male noyse o'th Streets; The Womens cries, Loud shriekes, &amp; howlings, make the Female. Between them A strange, ambiguous, confus'd roare's begot, Much like the fall of Nilus, where the waters Make All that dwell neare deafe. Art. My lodging stands I'th' Middle Region, Gentlemen; I lye Every Night in a Storme, and every Morning Do rise in perfect Thunder; Then my sleeps Are but my dayes feares; which do walke; and then Present themselves in Visions. Two Armies usually Joyne Battle in my Dreames; where I behold Thine, His, My Braines knockt out. And when I wake, Wonder to find my selfe with all my Limbs; Feele for my other Legge; suspect my eyes When they informe me I have both my Armes. Neand: I've slept but twice e're since the newes came that Eurymedon was landed; And then I had The strangest Dreames too. My Man found mee scaling My Curtaines for a Fort; Killing my Pillow; And entring Duel with my Breeches. Last night Me thought wee Three (pray Heaven avert the Omen) Were shut up here ith' City, and besieg'd By th'Hangings of my Chamber. Call: How? Neand: Me thought The Trojan faces were all turn'd to Thracians. And in this Siege, I dream't, that You, and Hee, Forc'd by the Famine, were resolv'd to be My Cannibals and eat mee. Art: I doe feele One of my Surloynes going. Call: Well, what followed? Neand: At last you cast Dice on my Body, which Part should be eaten first; And after all Concluded on my Head, and Purtenance. Call: These are the fruites of Theevery; Thus 'tis Gentlemen, When Kings can't Love the common way, but must Needs couple without Friends consent, and draw A Hue and Crye of fourty thousand after 'em. Neand: True, Callias; I doe maintaine, that Armies Plundering of Townes, and ravishing of Virgins, As naturally follow a good Face Stolne, as this was, as Aches doe your Wenching. Or as your Taylor, Artops, followes you With an old Bill unclear'd. Art: There surely is An unknowne pleasure in all Matrimony Which carries danger with it. Else, why should Men So itch to steale their Wives? Our Neighbour Troy Is, Gentlemen, a sad example. If This prove a Smocke-Warre of some ten yeares long; Or if Roxane be the Comet, and The burning of Bithynia the bright blaze Which shee drawes after her, wee cannot helpe it. How stand you two affected to the Warre? Call: Troth, I should like the Campe well, if the Fields Did bring forth Featherbeds. Or if the Streames, Like those oth' Golden age, did run pure Wine. Or if Court Meales would every twelve, and seven, Observe due howres. But, Gentlemen, to lye Halfe starv'd, with cold, ith' Aire on scarce fresh Greensword; Just so match earth to earth; And then to live The Life of Nature; or, as some doe call it, The life oth' Hardy; Quench my thirst at the Next Spring, or Fountaine; Coffin up my selfe Each night in Turfe; and thence come forth like one Of Cadmus Souldiers, sowne of Serpents Teeth, And start forth armed from a furrow, is A course, I feare, I shall leave to the valiant. Nean: And then the dangers. Art: True. Nean: Here comes a troope on, And you in honour can't but loose an eye. An Engine there goes off, and you will show Your selfe a Coward unlesse you loose an Arme. Here y'are surrounded, and then 'twere base to bring More then one shoulder off. Gentlemen, Consider What a Discredit 'tis to have a Nose After a Battle; Or to walke the Streets On your owne legs. Art: I feele my selfe, already, Partly compos'd of Flesh, partly of Wood. Methinkes I swing betweene two Crutches, like One hang'd in Chaines, and tost by th'Winde; I looke Within this weeke, to bee but halfe the Thing You see me Now; The rest lopt off; And I Slic'd into Reputation. Call: I doe perceive Your discreet Disaffection to the Warre. Neand: 'Tis but a wise care of our safety; Nature Bids us preserve our selves. Art: But how, Neander, How, without losse of fame, can we avoid To accompany the King? Neand: Why, breifly thus. The King intends to send the Princesses Over to the Island as the safer place. And will assigne a thousand for their Guard. Let's get our selves enroll'd ith' Number; so, Besides security, wee shall enjoy The Company o'th Ladies. Art: Right; And in The absence of their Lords. Call: Peace, here they come. SCÃNA II. To them Archidamus, Roxane, Barsene, Orithya, ThalÃ¦stris, Polydamas, Lyncestes, Theagines, Meleager. Arch: You see your Nuptials, Bright Roxane, and What choyce y'have made. I thought to have brought you to A Court and Palace, where your entertainement Would have beene only Songs of Virgins; Posts Crown'd and adorn'd with Gyrlands; Sacrifices Striving to make our Streets but one perfume; And taking from our sight our Temples, with The numerous Clouds of Incense which they scatter. And send forth from their breathing Altars; And No other sounds heard but my peoples shouts, And acclamations for your wisht arrivall. But you perceive y'are landed in a Campe; And your first step upon the shore proves to you A most unnaturall Seige. If for a Brother Thus to pursue a Sister be unnaturall. Roxan: Had you had his Consent, Sir, and no storme Follow'd your transportation of me from His Court to yours, but had you, undisturbed, Untroubled, in the progresse of your Love, Proceeded to the Temple, There joyn'd hands, And matcht the common way of Princes where All that's requir'd to make the wedding Day Solemne, are Tapers, Banquets, Revels, Musicke, 'T had beene a Dreame, no Marriage; our soft Ioyes Would have lost both their edge and appetite. That which you call unnaturall in my Brother, I looke on as a favour; Thanke him for The Argument he lends mee to expresse How much more Deare your Dangers make you to mee. Beleeve mee, Great Archydamus, the fire You kindled in my heart, when in those still, Quiet, silent nights you first did wooe mee, was But a weake Sparke, compar'd to the large Flame Which this Warre kindles in mee. I behold Now a new amiablenesse in You; And Looke on you through this Tempest, which is rays'd For my sake, as one made more Lovely to mee. And with the same content doe take delight To mingle Sufferings, as Nuptials with you. Nor should I thinke my selfe your Queene, unlesse With the same equall Minde, I could goe halfe In perils, as in Kingdomes with you. Arch: Still You doe speake like your selfe, Roxane, Still Breath words, which sweeten Dangers, and provoke mee To court them in their worst and dreadfull'st shape; As things, without which, I should want fit Matter To merit by, or some way make my selfe Worthy of her for whom I undertake them. Nor will I doubt of victory, where I Have such a brave Inspirer. Had I beene Borne cold, or sent into the World a Coward, Such a faire second, such a beauteous Cause, Would strike a valiant Heat into me; And Were my Sea cover'd with as many Shippes, As anchor'd before Troy; or should an Army, As vast, and numerous as his, who dranke Up Rivers in his passage, and join'd Europe To Asia with his fleet invade mee, I Assisted with your Vertues, should not doubt Enter Eurim. Clit. Hipp. But to return with Conquest. Who are these? Lyncest. Th'Embassadours sent from the Prince of Thrace, To demand restitution of their Princesse. Ar: Admit 'em to our presence. Pol: The King expects you. SCÃNA III. To them Eurymedon, disguis'd like an Embassadour, Clytus, Hyppocles. Archid: We are now prepar'd to heare your Embassy; Your Prince's pleasure? Clyt: By us, Archidamus, With all the freedome which an injur'd Prince Can use towards Him that wrong'd Him, He lets you know, That 'tis no thirst, or covetous Ambition, T'enlarge his Territories, or to seeke conquest there, Where 'tis as easie for him to o'rcome Almost as say so, which hath provok't him Thus to invade your Kingdome; But a just sense, And apprehension of the blot, and staine, Which Annals and posterity (Besides The scorne oth' present Age) must sticke upon His sluggish memory, if He coldly should Sleepe o're his Infamy; or let you breake The Lawes of Hospitality; and abuse His Court, in carrying away a prize More deare to him then his Kingdome, unrevenged. For though you may pretend Love for your boldnesse, Or say the Princesse was an Actor in Her Amorous stealth, (which yet Hee much suspects, And she must blush t'acknwoledge) He saies, Herein You doe but guild your Crime; For what you call Affection Hee cals Rape; And saies, Hee hopes, You'l pardon Him, if Hee doe looke upon You, Not as a Guest, but Robber; One that came not To fetch a Queene, but to transport a prey. Archid: Is this all? Eurym: He addes farther, that though Hee Confesse Himselfe inferiour to the loud Fame of your Sisters Beauty; To which nought Can be a Match but her owne vertues; yet, When Hee lookes on the Story of his Ancestours, From which Hee thinkes Hee hath not yet degenerated; When hee considers (without boasting) that He's borne to a Kingdome, to which yours hath beene (Be't spoke without contempt) a Tributary; But chiefly, when he searcheth his owne mind, And findes nought Hostile there; but a pure fire, Kindled from the report of the admir'd, Inflaming, rayes, diffus'd from her bright eyes, He thinkes you trespasse against love, Sir, to Obey an angry, conquer'd, old mans Will, Made in the passion of his Overthrow, Although your Father, and to refuse a suite More noble, and open, then your owne; And whil'st Y'are pious, shew your selfe revengefull too. Hippoc: Briefly Sir, therefore whither it were force, Or Combination, (For which to call it He saies he knowes not) unlesse you will restore His Sister, or repaire him with your owne, He saies, he is resolv'd, either to fall A willing sacrifice to his wrong'd Honour, Or build his unglad satisfaction on The Ruines of your Country. And to this He doth require your Answer. Archid: Were Roxane A Hellen, (as she's not in ought I know But her great Beauty) Or were I a Paris; (Who finde my selfe none but ith' numerous fleet Brought after me) Had I beene entertain'd A Prince, by a Prince, Sir, at your Masters Court, And, in his absence, had first loosely tempted To my unlawfull bed, then stolne his Wife; I do confesse 'twere just for him to cite The breach of Hospitality, and t'invoke The Gods of Weddings, and Marriages against me. And I, till I restor'd th'unlawfull prey, Should looke upon my selfe, not as a Guest, But Ravisher. But if I came a Suitor, And brought a flame as pure, as holy, as That which burnes on his Altars; If the Princesse, Her owne free Empresse did vouchsafe to meet Mine with the like pure, amorous, equall fire: If I have since preserv'd her honour; kept Her white, and spotlesse as a Vestall; still Approach't her presence with the same religion As I would places consecrate, or Temples, Whil'st thus Hee doe's pursue my harmelesse Love, With Words farre more injurious then his Armies, With the like freedome You may tell Him, I'me The injur'd Prince. And though I grant his Father Once conquer'd mine, and wee paid Tribute, (which Hee does not nobly to upbrayd) It may be My turne to conquer next. Nor is the Bay Planted so firmely on his head, but that A good cause may remove it, and mak't mine. As for our close departure from his Court, Which he brands with the stile of Rape and Theft, You must assist me, Madam; was I your pyrate, Or Servant? Did I lead you away Captive, Or conspire with you? Rox: Sir, 'twere one wrong more Offer'd to your Vertues, And I should transgresse Against my cleare Affections, not to say, The Plot was halfe mine, you did reveal your thoughts, With so much generous heate, so worthy of mee, That I had noe way left t'expresse my selfe As generous too, but to mixflame with flam; And to requite you with this poore returne, To make your Country mine; And there to thinke My selfe a Princesse onely, where I might Call you my Prince. Arch: Then, for my Sister, I am no Tyrant like your Master, Sir, To claime a sway o're her Affections; Nor Doe count her Will ith' number of my Subjects: She has free Liberty to make her choice; And can best answer you. Onely shee will, I hope remember, if there be a reverence Due to the words of dying Parents; Or if The last, short, breath were sacred, which bequeath'd her To th'Prince of Thessaly, she can't consent Unto your Masters Suite, and not disturbe Her Fathers Shade, to call him from his Urne, To be a greiv'd Spectatour of her Nuptials. Barsen. Besides Sir, as a stranger to a stranger, Pray beare a Princesse message to your Prince. Tell Him He comes not nobly, thus t'invade Her whom he loves; or strive to make Her His By a forc't Conquest. He's the first I've read of Who Woo'd a Lady with an Army by; Or put a ponyard to his Mistrisse breast, And then desir'd t'appeare gratious. Wee looke for softer Courtships; Humble prayers; Sighes which confesse the Breather is our Captive. I have no Beauty to entice him to Lay downe his forces. But if he come unarm'd, In Person, (For I doe not like State Love, Or to be woo'd by an Embassadour,) If He bring with Him noble purposes, Such as my Brothers were, tell him, perhaps, I shall as nobly heare him. Meane time, his Sister, And I expect some penance from him, for Thus Troubling of our Peace. Eur: Doe you enjoyne The Chaine, or Fetters, 'twil be his glory Madam, To weare them as your prisoner, Exeunt Eurym. Clit. Hyp. SCÃNA IV. Archidamus, Roxane, Barsene, Polydamas, Lyncestes, Theagines, Meleager, Orithya, ThalÃ¦stris. Archid: âHave you prepar'd The Ships, Lyncestes, to convey the Ladies Over to th'Island? Lync: They are ready Sir, And only doe expect their beauteous fraught. The Ladies Sir, will looke like Goddesses Borne of the Sea. Archid. And have you made, Polydamas, The Castle fit to entertaine them? Polyd: Sir, The Ladies lock't up in a Brasen Tower Were not more safe? 'Tis now a place where pleasure Dwels joyn'd with Strength. It onely wants their presence, To be a Fort without, within a Pallace. Arch: You are turn'd young againe, My Lords; you speake So amorously I do begin to doubt Whether you may be trusted with a charge So dangerously inflaming. Polyd: Sir, our sonnes Can promise for us, we intend no sieges Against their Beauties, in your absence; All Our Batteries to good faces were long since Spent on their mothers. Arch: Wee dare venture you. Your sonnes, Theagines and Meleager, Shall goe with us to th'Feild. Rox: And will you then, Deprive mee of the Glory Sir, of being A sharer in your dangers? I endur'd The Sea with you; Why should you thinke I am More timerous to endure the Land? Arch: Because The Land's now more tempestuous then the Sea. For that smiled on your passage; And the Waves, As if they had teemed with a second Venus, Or understood the sweetnesse of their burden, Grew calme, serene, and Halcyon. But here You will expose your selfe to Night Alarmes, Day Battles; and runne hazards where the blinde Sword can't distinguish 'twixt the faire and foule; See men act Wolves parts, and behold a spectacle, Not fit for your soft Sex, Men falne, and dying, Striving to kill their killers and depart With mutuall slaughter. Rox: What difference is there Betwixt the eye, and fancy, but onely this That dangers to the Absent still shew greater? When I make these descriptions to my selfe, And thinke you in the midst, though no Spectatour, I shall as truely suffer. My owne Thoughts Of you will passe for Battles; And my feares, Where e're you place mee, will be fights and sieges. You could not deale more cruelly, should you Restore me to my Brother, then thus divorce Me from your Company. Besides, It is My Cause you fight for; I've an interest Going in the Warre; And will you, Sir, deny mee The poore content of binding up your Wounds Received for mee? Bars: Madam, you'l give me leave, Here to strive with you; I've a Cause going too. Let me Sir, joyne in the request, that you Will take us with you. If there be noe other Use of us, We'l help to put on your Armes, And take them off. Meleag: If our two Wives do joyne In the Petition, with their Chambermaids, They'l make a Female Regiment. Theag: I looke My Wife within these three dayes shall be Knighted. Meleag: And I that mine be made a Collonel. Arch: Alas you know not what you aske; pray tell me, How would a Speare shew in your hand Roxane? Or Sister, How d'you thinke it would become you To weild a Pike? or weare a sword? Or how Could I looke on my selfe but as a guilty Betrayer of you, if the chance of Warre Should snatch you from mee? Or you two be made Part of the Conquerours Triumph? Come; I have Provided gentler entertainments for you. Your wishes will supply your presence; and Put Wings unto my Victory. Rox: 'Tis part: Of my love Sir, to be obedient. Exeunt. SCÃNA V. Theagines, Meleager, Orithya, ThalÃ¦stris. Theag: What? You expect we should be solemne now, And take a ceremonious farewell of you? Oryth. We should not else thinke we have civill husbands; To leave us bluntly; or as Souldiers court Their Mistrisses; who scarce doe aske consent But fall to th'businesse. Mel: Well, looke you show your selves Our true Wives in our abscence. If you should, To ease retirement, and divert the Melancholy Of Solitude, weave us a fine Court Lawrell To Crowne our Victories at our returneâ You understand ThalÃ¦stris? Thal: Sir, we hope You are not jealous; you will place no Spies, To register who visits vs. Theag: No Lady; But Stories speake of certaine strange things done, By Ladies in th'absence of their Lords. Thal: They speake Sir, of as strange things done by Lords In th'absence of their Ladies. Mel: If wee should Slip from the Campe sometimes, and steale a night, I hope you would not shut your Castle gates Against us, would you? Orith: 'Tis as wee heare report Whither y'are valiant. I disdaine a Coward Though't be my Husband. Thal: And I. Theag: And in these Stout, generous thoughts we leave you. Orith: Looke I doe Winne reputation by you. Mel: Farewell ThalÃ¦stris. Thal: Remember, Sir, You doe things worthy of mee. Exeunt Theag: Meleag: SCÃNA VI. To them Callias, Neander, Artops. Call: Ladies, we have a small suite to you, which Concernes your selves. Orith: 'Twill the more easily Be granted, Sir, what is't? Neand: 'Tis, that you'l speake To th'King, we may stay, and be listed Guards Unto your persons, in these times of Danger. Art: 'Tis no plot Ladies, to decline the War; But to doe service to you here at home; And to defend you 'gainst Assaults. Thal: That, Sir, The Fortwill doe, and the strong Wals oth' Castle. Call. Troth, Madam, we begge this in pitty to you. How will you spend your Dayes, Ladies with Ladies, And but two reverend old Males among you? Neand: Either you must betake your selves to your needles, And worke the Seige of Troy o're; or the TragÅdy Of Hero and Leander, in sad Stitches; Or else betake your selves to your spindle, like Penelope, and sing the adventures of Your absent Husbands to a distaffe, and Beguile the Houres in flax. Call. Or else you must Hire some old, frosty, cold Philosopher, To read on flowers t'you, every time you walke Into the Garden, and convert their Colours Into Your Lectures. Show You why the Primrose Is pale, and why the Marygold is red. Art: Then for your Nightsâ Call. True, Ladies, Doe but consider, How you will spend your Nights? Art: Watch how your lone, Forsaken, Taper wastes it selfe, and pines Away, out oth' meere sense it hath to burne So fruitlesly, till it consume it selfe Into its owne Darknesse? Neand: Or shall your Women, keep you: Awake with amorous Tales? Troth, Ladies, Story Is a dead Thing, if not reduc'd to practise. Say, to delude the tediousnesse oth' Night, You should share ith' same bed. Two oth' same Sex, Make but one in th'affaires of Love. Thal. We see Y'have studied our case for us. Truth is, Gentlemen, The lists are full already. Orith. Besides, 'twoud breed Suspicions in our Husbands. So we leave you. Exeunt. Call. We are defeated, Gentlemen; Neand: what remedy? Art: By that time they've layne fallow but three Nights They will send after, and petition us. Call: Come let's prepare to goe with th'King. Neand. Lead on; Necessity breed's resolution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS. II. SCÃNA I. Enter severally two old Citizens frighted. 1 Cit. Oh Neighbourâ 2 Cit. What's the newes. Sir? 1 Cit. Heavy newes, Oh Sirâ 2 Cit. Out with it. 1 Cit. Neighbour, I doe looke Within this houre not to be worth a Spit, Brasse pot, or a Childs whistle; or to be able, To call this aged Sattin doublet mine, In which I've borne five prÃ¦torships. The enemy Hath taken the Island, burnt the Castle, and The Ladies in't. 2 Cit. How? 1 Cit. One of their Guard who scap'te, Heard six of 'em cry out for water. And They are sailing towards the City. 2 Cit. I'le home presently, And hide my money. It came from the Earth, And shall awhile thither returne againe. 1 Cit. That will not serve the turne. 2 Cit. Not? 1 Cit. Noe; They say, There is one ship laden with nought but Engines, To torture those who doe refuse to tell Where they have hid their Wealth. I feele my fingers Already squeez'd 'twixt pincers; Irons hissing At the soles of my feet; My body caught Up into th'Aire by the Strapado, Trickes Showne on my Limbs; My bones tost out of joint, And finely tost, and rackt in joint againe. 2 Cit. To prevent this, and to defeat their tortures, I'le choose my owne death, and eene hang my selfe. SCÃNA. II. To them enter two Women Citizens. 1 Wom. What pitty 'tis that such fine Ladies should Have such untimely ends. 1 Cit. D'you heare? The newes Is certaine. They are burnt. 2 Cit. I doe perceive it. Pray Heark. 2 Wom. They say Great people have their Destinies, As well as Meaner. And they that are borne Under a Watry Planet, to be drown'd, Shall ne're dye in their beds. 2 Cit: Are then, the Ladies Drown'd, Gentlewoman? 2 Wom: Not cast away by wrack, sir. It seemes the Enemy way layd the Shippes That carryed 'em, and sunke 'em. 1 Cit: But is this certaine? 1 Wom: Most certaine Sir, my Husbands Journey man Came just now from the Port, and saw ten of Their bodies swim downe with the Tide. 2 Cit: And what D'you heare oth' Enemies comming? 1 Wom: They have sent A most strange Message to the City, Sir. 1 Cit: What is't, I pray? 1 Wom: Why, Sir, that all rich Burgesses Must put themselves in Tribes; And in their Chaines, And scarlet Gownes, some three houres hence, must, in A solemne, grave, procession, two, and two, Your Officers before you, with their Maces, T'enrich the entertainment, meet them at Their Landing; where together with your Chaines, Y'are to resigne the Keyes to all your Chests, 2 Wom: And, then, for us; They do demand that all Who are not rich, but yet have handsome Wives, Shall yeild them up. How do you thinke, Sir, will The Souldiers deale with us, like Women? 1 Wom: I do So feare their boisterousnesse. Will they, thinke you, Strip us and leave us naked? Or be content To ravish us, and let us goe? 2 Wom: Looke, here Doe's come my servant Pistoclerus; he Enter Pistoc: Can tell us more. What newes deare servant? Pist: Fly, fly, The Prince is overthrowne; The Ladies are All taken Prisoners; The Enemy is enter'd Halfe way into the City; Your two Houses By this are ransack't; I saw divers loads Of Jewels, Plate, and Hangings, carryed out. 1 Cit: But good, but good Sir, is this true? Pist: Is my Name Pistoclerus? 1 Cit: Yes, Sir. Pist: Then 'tis true. Make haste and save your Daughters, or they'l else Be put to ransomes for their Maiden heads. 1 Cit: We thanke you Sir. Come Neighbour. 2 Cit: Oh that ever I did live to be rich, or see these Dayes. Exeunt: Cit: Pist: Your husbands too are seiz'd on, And are threatned To be put to the Racke, unlesse they will Produce their Wives. 1 Wom: Wee'l make haste to releeve them 2 Wom: I take my leave; And shall be glad to see you Sometimes ith' Suburbs Sir, Pist: I'le follow you. Exeunt Women. Pist: This is call'd ComÅdy, raised from TragÅdy. Never was City in such tumult, as I have put this into. The women want Nothing but speares, circled with Ivy, to hold A perfect feast to Bacchus. And to beate Their Pans, and Kettles, up and downe the streets, Instead of Drums, and Cymbals. The men have all Armed themselves with what came next to hand. I saw a Troope of Butchers marching downe Their Shambles with their Cleavers. After them Follow'd a Regiment of Taylors with Their Yeards, and Bodkins. In the reare, a Company Of Shoomakers with Awles. Each Trade takes Armes Within its owne profession. Now will I follow My Suburbe Mistrisse; whose husband is content To make one oth' fifteene of us; And doth Connive by turnes. The tamest fellow, and So little owner of his owne Wife, that He verily beleeves hee Cuckolds us When he lyes with her. Amongst us there is One Maim'd Souldier, with one legge, who still payes doubt; And goes to bed to her with a stirrope? 'Tis The common'st, and the prating'st Varlet, she Cals me her ChÃ¦rilus, I her my Lycoris. She makes me tell her newes whole dayes together: Which I, her spunge, do sucke up in my travels From Company to Company, and doe Enlarge with my Additions, and Notes politicke; And then as severally disperse; And so Draw Custome to her House; which she cal's pay. SCÃNA III. Lyncestes, Polydamas: Lync: This must needes be conspiracy; There is A Riddle in't my Lord, which you and I Cannot unfold. It must be Time, the Mother Of Truth, which must expound this Mystery, How should they draw their Fleet up else? By what Instinct, or marke, should they know so exactly The Shippe the Ladies were in, As if they Had hung their Petticoats for sailes up, or Had turn'd their Gownes to streamers? Single it out From all the rest, and take 'em? As if one Oth' Princesses had beene a signe oth' Vessell, And stood forth the Roxane, or Barsene, Instead oth' Centaure, Andromeda, or Castor? Polyd: They did not bring a Thracian Prophet with them, Or call Tyresias from the Elysian Groves, To be their Oracle, to tell them justly The Criticall Point, and Minute of our passage. 'Tis now just stealth for stealth; our King transported One paire of blacke eyes, And they've seized a Carricke, And Ship full of them. Lync: I will straight put to Sea, In their pursuite. If they be not transform'd Into Sea-Nimphs; Or hide their watry Deities 'Mongst Eeles, and Dolphins. I will rescue them. Polyd: 'Twill concerne me to stay here, and compose Those Frights oth' City; which this newes hath put Into a posture of Confusion. At your returne we will to th'King; And let Him know the Accident. Meane time, In hope You'l bring them home true Ladies, as they went. That's humane Ladies, purely made of Flesh; Or else true Mermaides, that is, Ladies made Halfe Fish, halfe Flesh, I'le stop all Messengers. The newes will but disturbe his Victories. Exeunt SCÃNA IV. Enter Clytus and Hyppocles with Orithya, ThalÃ¦stris, Menalippe and Marthesia like Amazon Captives, shackled with Golden Fetters, and pinnion'd with silken cords, two &amp; two as in a Wood. Clyt: Could you imagine you could carry your Designe in Clouds, and change your shapes, like Spirits, And take what formes you please, and we not know it? Hypp: Alas we had our plot going too; Our spies Gave us intelligence, where, when to seize you. 'Tis not unknowne to us, you called a Councell Of Warre; In which, without your husbands knowledge, You did resolve to put your selves in Armes, And fight against us. We can tell you that Roxane was to be your Generall; Barsene Captaine of the Engines; You, Lady Ulisses, were to command the Horse, This Lady Hector the foot; And these two, here, Were to be Scouts by Night, by Day your Squires, To beare your Targets after you. Orith: Y'have had A noble Conquest of it, to surprize A Company of poore weake Women. Is this The valour of your Nation, to proceed By plot and stratagem 'gainst such as us? Clyt: These are Warre Arts. Thal: Or is this noble usage, To Fetter us, and cast us into Chaines? You could but Manicle your slaves thus. Clyt. We Do but observe the Law of Armes towards those Whom we do take in Armes. Orith: Does then the Law Bid you keepe no distinction betweene Sexes? Hypp: Yes, where the Persons whom we conquer do. But you have lost your priviledge; And put off Your Sex for ours. Clit: We looke not on you now, As vanquish't Ladies, but as vanquish't Captaines; And so must use you. Orith: Alas, what's your Intent? Is't to enrich your selves with our poore spoyles? Thal: If Plunder be your aime, pray take our jewels; Bestow them on your Mistresses, at your Returne; And tell them how generously, how stoutly, You purchast them; Say you betraid the Wearers First, and then rifled 'em. Orith: Pray strip us; And Let us redeeme our Liberty with the Poore ransome of our Cloathes. Clyt: You are deceiv'd; Our purposes are much more high, and noble, Then to raise booty from you, Theeves conquer so. Our Custome is, when we take Prisoners, to Lead them in Triumph through our Thracian streets; Your Beauties, thus adorned, will save the charge Of guilded Pageants, to entertaine the People. Thal: Must we be made a show, then, to delight Your Wives and children? Clyt: How should they make us welcome At our returne else? Hipp: Could we take your fields, And Townes, and Cities, and Rivers Prisoners too, And could transport them with us, these we should Make part oth' Triumph; But because we cannot, What Nature makes impossible, we do Supply with Art, And lead them painted; And The Pencill doth present in Colours, what The Truth of Things denies. Clyt: Then for your persons, Being our lawfull Captives; 'Tis our Custome To give you to our Ladies, to be their slaves In ordinary; To starch, and to belong Unto their Laundries, And so we doe divide Our Conquests with them. But because we will Deale honourably with you, we intend To use you as our other Wives; you shall Be seconds in the pleasures of our Beds. Hipp: I do presume such Warlike Ladies, as Your selves, must have read Homer; you shall be My Briseis, I your Agamemnon. Clyt: You My Chrysis, I your stout Achilles; These Two white she Myrmidons will serve to raise A Breed betweene them and our Pages. Orith: Sir, Have you a sense of Noblenesse? Clyt. Yes Lady, And you shall finde it. Orith: Finish your Conquest, then, And take a life I'me weary of, I am Your Prisoner, Let me be your slaughter too. Thal: Shew your selves equally as valiant in Our Death, as our Surprize. Take a fraile breath, Which, to enjoy, with these conditions, will Adde new weights to our Thraldome; And you will Afflict us with our preservation. Orith: By your owne Lady, Sir, if you have one, Let me beseech you, kill mee; 'Twill be farre More noble then to Love me. Thal: Every houre We live your Captives, thus, will seeme an Age Of Infamy. Menal: Madam, Let's stand upon Our Naturall Defence; They are but two Against us foure. Marth: Let's Mutiny, and by Our owne swords free our selves. They've onely A Heart to take us treacherously like Theeves; But dare not fight with us. Clyt: What would you do Pretty Serjant Major Damsell were you loose, Who are thus Valiant in your Shackles? Hypp: Now You'l know your Doomes. Here comes our Prince with his Faire brace of Prisoners. SCÃNA V. To them Eurymedon, Roxane, Barsene, like Amazons, as in a Wood. Eurym: âY'are the first Lady, Madam, That e're yet bore such Armes against her Lover. I thought to finde your Quiver in your Lookes, Not hanging at your backe; And to encounter No Shafts or Arrowes, but those bright ones shot From your faire eyes. Thus doubly arm'd you have Taken a Course to make me twice your Captive. Bars: You show, Sir, how you love me thus to stile Your selfe the prisoner, of your prisoner. Y'are the first Prince I've read of, (If I may Call you a Prince, who by this act have showne Your selfe s'unlike one) who first did surprize His Mistrisse, and then Wooed her; Or bound her first, Then told her that he loved her. Wilde Salvages, And lustfull Satyres court thus; who do know No difference betwixt their Loves, and Rapes; But call a rude force Kindnesse; Thinke th'are amorous Ith' midst of violence; And call't Loves fire, And flame, which is a foule intemperate heate, Kindled from every thing that's faire; on which They looke not as 'tis faire, or amiable, But as it may be sullyed and contribute Unto their beastly satisfaction. Eurym: I hope you thinke not, Madam, I'le make use Of this advantage so barbarously, as T'attempt your person? Bars. âThat were a crime, which would Provoke the Gods, which doe inhabit these Quiet, hallowed shades, to take revenge upon you. And you would trespasse 'gainst the place, as well As 'gainst your honour. Eurym: I do confesse you are, To an irregular eye, wholly compos'd Of sweet enticements. A thousand Beauties fly From you, at every looke in soft Temptations. And from a minde which knowes no holyer use Of such a heavenly forme, but first to covet, And then t'enjoy, there might be danger; And The Assailer might excuse his fault from that Which left him not himselfe, but snatcht him to Forbidden pleasures. But I doe looke upon you With other eyes. As y'are to me a Venus, And strike a warme flame in me, so you are Diana too, and do infuse a chaste, Religious coldnesse. You do not onely stand Before me safe as in a Circle, made By your owne charmes; But do incircle me With the same Vertuous spels. Bars: I yet scarce thinke My selfe secure, when I thinke you my Pyrate. Eurym: You'l finde the enterprize deserves a name More gentle, when you know my Sister went Halfe Pyrate with me. I had no other way To gaine a free, and Innocent Accesse. To enter your Castle had beene impossible; Unlesse, like Jove, I had transform'd my selfe Into a Showre, and rained my selfe downe from The Skies into your presence. Bars: Had you a hand In my betraying, then? Rox: If for one Lady To contrive Service for another; Or if T'assist a Brother in his Vertuous Love Be to betray, I do confesse Barsene, I'me a Conspiratour. Or if he breake Conditions, and make this ignoble use Of such a favour, having had his Audience, Not to restore us to our Liberty, I am betrayed too. They were first my Letters Which drew him from his Country with a Fleete, In show for my pursuite, but in reality, T'enjoy this Interveiw, and make his eyes The Judges of the picture I made of you; Or whether I err'd not in my discriptions, or Presented you by a false partiall light, When I decipher'd you just such another As he doth now behold you. Bars: Is this true, Sir? Eurym: Witnesse ye Gods, if among all your Worshippers, There be one who contemplates your Divine, Invisible, Shapelesse, substances with a More awfull reverence, or paies Devotion To Powers he sees not with a stronger fervour, Then I did to you, Madam; whom I did Adore before I saw; And you had then A perfect Shrine, and Temple in me; where I did frame such Ideas of you, so pure. So free from these grosse figures, which do stirre The vulgar admiration, that, if I said, A Minde was worshipt by a Minde, And that My thoughts supply'd the place of Sacrifices, Which flew betweene us; And, like winged prayers, Maintain'd a sacred Entercourse, &amp; traffique, With the Originall of what I fancy'd, I doe but rudely, but halfe expresse my selfe. Bars. You make me blush. Eur. But when in the disguise Of my Embassadour, I saw before me The Queene of Love, veil'd in your beauteous shape; With all her Graces, &amp; winged Cupids about her. When I beheld all those celestiall Images, Which I fram'd of your Absence, and ador'd Abstracted from you, cloth'd in your faire face, If I projected for this houre, or us'd The Invention of one strucke, to purchase this Short Audience from you, you are t'impute th'offence, Or boldnesse, not to me, but unto Nature, Who did not make me blind, But sent me in To th'world with eyes. Bars: If you proceed, I must Accuse her, that she gave me eares to heare Such praises so misplac'd. Eur: Madam, then breifly, I claime an interest in you, Love for Love; Which that you may grant as a Princesse, and I Receive it as a Prince, here I doe banish All showes and signes of Hostile force, and doe Release you, and your faire Traine. You Hippocles, And Clytus, First aske pardon for your cruelty, Although but acted, and then unbinde the Ladies. Clyt: Madam, I hope you can forgive; If not, Please you to take me prisoner, so you will They unbind 'em. Promise my thraldome shall be onely such As yours should have beene, had we in earnest kept you Outright our Captives, I will be content To exchange shackles with you. Hipp: Pray hold your legs A little fairelier, Madam. Methinkes we two Make the Embleme of the Jealous husband, and The Handsome wife. Orith: How's that Sir? Hipp: Why there was One, who by day still lockt his wife in chaines, And gave her ease by night. Clyt: You two would faine Have your two legges at large too. Hipp. Now your Armes Are set at liberty, looke you imploy not Your naturall weapons against us. Men. What are those Sir? Hipp. Your Nailes. Men. We scorne to scratch. Eur. Next, after this Rude Interruption of it, (For when you Have pardon'd it, I still must looke upon It as an amorous Crime) I will my selfe Continue your safe passage to your Island; And see you receiv'd in your Castle. Bar. That Will onely alter our Captivity, Not tak't away. We must still thinke our selves Your prisoners there, if you beare Armes against us. Eurym. Here, then, To let you see, my purpose is not To be an Enemy to your Brother, and A Supplicant to you; But that I came To carry a Queene, not conquest home with me, I doe resigne my Forces, and lay downe My selfe, and Armies at your Feet, Bright princesse; Say, what peace would you have? I will refuse No Articles, so you be one of them. Barsen. You have exprest your selfe so Nobly, showne Such generous Signes of your Intentions, and Gayn'd such a Conquest or'e me by your free, And Princely Carriage, That as an earnest of Greater returnes, Wee'l make you partner in A harmelesse plot we have, which shall conclude With all that all we wish. Rox. Wee've a Designe To try how our surprize takes with our Campe, Our Habits and the Art we will put to 'em, Will keepe us from being knowne. Bars. I will deferre Your farther satisfaction, or confesse How much I am engag'd, Sir, to requite Your pure Affections with my owne, 'till our Next Conference. And left you should beleive, (How ere y'have chang'd a Tempest to a calme, And make me now in Love with my owne fright) You not deserve to undergoe some penance For making us afraid, your punishment, Shall be to fetch my Answer at my Tent, Eurym. And I shall think't an Age 'till I receive it. Exeunt. SCÃNA. VI. Callias, Neander, Artops. Call. Did we three ere looke to be Captaines? Nean. Troth, I thought my Marches onely would have beene To lead a Company of Ladies in Court Ranke, and File, unto a Maske, and Play, And backe againe. Art. And as for skirmishes, I thought all mine would have proov'd Chamber ones, Tongue-Fights. Or if they had proceeded farther To th'Drawing of Bloud, at most, Naile-Combates. Call. I've The strangest Company of Voluntiers; All Gentlemen of Hedges, &amp; Highwayes. I doe command an Hospitall. Of Fifty But two have Shirts among 'em; And those worne Not as shift, or Things at first ordain'd to be Made cleane, and washt; but as perpetuall Garments; Not to be put of 'till They doe forsake Their Wearers, Voluntarily, and creepe from them. That which was linnen once, Time turnes to Troopes. I'le undertake could all Quicke Things which are Bithynian in our Regiment beare Armes, We need not feare the Persian. Every Souldier Would be a moving Legion. Neand. My Company, Is much like yours. Last Muster, when I reckon'd By th'poll, They were Threescore, But when by doublets, Scarce Thirty; And these fit for summer Warres. A fine, warme, entercourse doth passe betweene Their Skin, and Sun. Farre off They show directly Like souldiers of the first Ages, before such Things As Clothes, or Garments were invented; Neare hand You'd thinke They had held civill conflict, and Torne one another thus ragged. If we fight With th'Enemy; their first great Enterprize Will be for Breeches; The next for Conquest. Art. Troth, Mine are not altogether so compleatly Ragged and torne, as yours are. But for Courages And Lookes, I doe perceive a kinde of quiet, Yet understood Conspiracy among them, How not to fight; And can observe a speaking, Sly Combination passe 'twixt face and face, How to escape. Their Marches are divided Betweene a certaine provident care to fly, And feare of hanging. Call: And yet these thin-sculd Rascals Dare mutiny for pay. This Morning I Consum'd in hearing greivances. One told me He was this Weeke preserv'd by Miracle; Liv'd on one bunch of Radishes, which sure He thinkes did multiply from one to many, He had beene famisht else. Another told me, A Cheese had like t'have rais'd Commotion 'Twixt him and foure Camerades; which had suffic'd them Foure Dayes. A Third doth verily beleive He shall in time reduce his Body to A perfect Habit of eating nothing; For He doth protest He hath not tasted food These eight and forty houres. Neand: Here comes the King. SCÃNA VII. To them Archidamus, Theagines, Meleager. Arch. How doe your Workes goe on. Theagines? Are they of Height and Strength enough to keepe Us from th'Assaults oth' Enemy, untill Our other Forces come? Theag: Unlesse we should Like th'Ancient Gyants, who invaded Heaven, Pile Hils on Hils, or compasse in our selves With Mountaines heap't on Mountaines, Sir, we cannot Immure our selves with more Defences, or Raise Guards more strong, or more Impregnable. That which was er'st a Champion Feild is now A perfect Fort. If they have winged Horses, Or feather'd Breed of Pegasus, and can Be a flying Army in the Aire, or give Us battle from the Clouds, there is some feare They may surprize us; But by th'common way Of Battery by Rammes, or Engines, They As well may beseige Rockes, or strive to make Their Souldiers scale Towers. Arch. And have you Meleager Made true Discovery of their Campe? Mel. It seemes They meane to make the plaine beyond next Hill, The Scene oth' Fight. I have observ'd from thence Their severall Quarters; Tents cast into Streets, Painted Pavillions in the midst, and Heart Oth' Leaguer, which show like moveable pallaces; And vye a kinde of bravery with the Sunne, Which shall cast, or reflect the brightest Glory. About these in a decent order stand A Numerous Towne of Tabernacles, of Lesse Glitterings, which doe end in a large Suburbs Of common souldiers Cabbins. Had they brought Their Wives, and Temples with them, it would be A perfect warlike City. Arch. You describe The preparations of a Wedding; This Trim show can't be intended for a fight. Have they secur'd all this with Trenches too? Have they Wals to their painted City? Mel: It seemes They meane their number shall supply those, Sir, Unlesse it were the Persian Army, which Was overcome by Alexander, where The Greekes at once fought, and beheld a Masque, Perform'd by Ladies in gilt Chariots; And where The Souldiers tooke Directions how to fight From Harpes and Lutes, which play'd betweene the battles, As betweene Acts and Entrances, I ne're read Of any expedition which consisted Of so much Spectacle and Number too. Arch. Surely Eurimedon hath rais'd these forces To make an Entertainment for my sister, A shout within. And make his Conquest of the Ladies show More sweet, and Courtly. Harke, what meanes this shout? Go one of you, and see. Call: Troth, Sir, if I Exit Neand. May take the humble leave to speake, methinkes You might compose this Warre by Treaty. A Preist, In my poore judgement, Sir, might save much bloud, And joine hands, which divided will joine battells. Arch: You faine would give up your Commission, Callias, And be at Court againe. Call: Troth, Sir, I had Much rather tire my selfe with dancing at Your, and your Sisters Nuptials, then here venture Marts on my transitory Life. Which if It have a lease of three weekes longer, or If providence doe spin it out a Moneth, 'Tis more then I expect. Your Father, Sir, Must thanke you in the Elisyan Shades hereafter. For being so pious, to preferre his will Before your Subjects safety. If Eurymedon Enter Neand. Endow your Sister with your Kingdome, say Your Court once bred a Prophet. Arch. Call'd a Coward. Neand: The Queene oth' Amazons, Sir, hearing of Your Warres, is newly landed, and hath brought An Army of She Archers in your Succour. She hath before her sent two Captaines of Her Guard, who call Themselves Embassadours; But looke Like Nymphs sent of an Errand from the Goddesse Of Woods and Huntings, who would have your leave, To make Warre on your Stags, Wild Boares, and Panthers. Looke here they come, Sir. SCÃNA VIII. To them Menalippe, Marthesia, like Amazons. Men. âPray which is the King? Neand. He, Lady, in the purple scarfe. Men. Our Queene, The famed Hippolyta, having atchiev'd Her conquest on the Scythians, and returning Home, with Antiope, her sister, to offer Their Lawrels up to those Assisting Gods Which cast them on their Victories, as she sayl'd Along your Coasts, hearing you are ingag'd In a Warre something like the Trojan, where She lost an Ancestour, offers her selfe, And whole Fleete to your service. Her reward, She sayes will be th'Acceptance, nor expects More thankes, then to be Knowne to your brave Selfe, And the faire Cause you fight for. Mar. She addes farther, That she desires (Because she will not, Sir, Unshippe her Forces, without your consent, Which might raise terrour in your people, And Appeare no Visit, but Invasion) You'l send a Conduct to meet her on the way Now towards your Camp; So, to secure the passage Of these few Ladies she brings with her. Arch. Ladies, Pray tell your Queene, she hath by your brave Message, Purchast one Lawrell more; And added Mee, And my whole Kingdome to her other Conquests. The honour she vouchsafes mee is so great, That I'le my selfe be of her conduct. Men. Sir, She's proud to be your soldier. Call. Ladies? Men. Sir? Call. You have no Message from the other Ladies, To us Three, have you? Men. How d'you meane? Call, If Your Queene come here to propogate; or if You, and your sister Warriours bring a purpose To carry home Bithynian Issue, pray tell em We are their Servants. Men. We shall Sir, Call. And so Diana speed you, Ladies. Arch: You two prepare Ex: Men: Marth: Campe Entertainment for her. You three put Your Troupes in order to attend us. Neand: We shall Sir: 'Twill be the strangest sight to see naked men March before Armed Women. Art: Gentlemen, Ex. Arch. Theag, Mel. What think you of this Embassy? Nea. Why that The Revolutions come, In which we shall, Be conquer'd of our Maidenheads. Art: Methinks I see my selfe already a Father to A fine, smart Amazon; I looke she should Come into th'World with Bow and Arrowes, And Be borne with a short sword. Call: If our fights prove Night Skirmishes, I'le sacrifice to Love. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS III. SCÃNA I. Callias, Neander, Artops. Call. Two weekes of this, conceive me, Gentlemen, We cannot scape a famine, but shall frolicke Our selves into a Dearth, Then live by th'Ounce, And dine and suppe in weight and measure, to Permit things to increase againe. We have At once exhausted three Elements, the Earth, Water, and Sky, for Rarities; If the fourth Bred ought but Salamanders, or afforded Ought strange, or edible, I doe believe We should have ransackt that too. Neand: I have read Of feasting and heard Philosophers dispute It for a vice, but ne're saw it practic'd but In this large entertainment. Sure the Lords Who had the ordering on't first read the workes Of some old studied Epicure, who placed Felicity ith' palate, and then brought His rules and precepts into cheere. There wanted Onely Pearles to be melted, Gems dissolved, And Jewels drunke to the Queenes health, to make it A perfect Sacrifice to Luxury. Art: If this hold, Gentlemen, I doe foresee We shall within this Month forget our selves To be Bithinyans, that is, Souldiers, who Can live on Campe fare, and turne Persians, Where our whole businesse will be onely these Two fine, soft, exercises, to eate, and wench. Call: How do you like the Queene? Nean. Me thinkes her cheekes, Speake through their Amorous browne, as if she came For something else then fighting. There's a story Of a Greeke Prince, and of a Queene, her Countrywoman, Who joyn'd Sex thirteene dayes together, to Raise Progeny betweene them. If this should Claime Copulation by the Law of Nations, And challenge a short use, for a month, or so, Of the Kings body, for procreation sake, I cannot see how, in humanity, Having so good a Title as the Want Of Men, and Males, in her owne Country; shee Can be denied. Art: Or if her Sister should Claime the short use of one of us, and plead Her naturall Right unto our Bodies, 'twere A Nationall Wrong, not to endeavour to Dismisse her with posterity. Neand: You speake As if you had hopes, Artops. Art: I professe To me shee's Lightning, Gentlemen; she melts My sword ith' scabberd; I stand before her like Stubble before a burning Glasse, Her eyes At every glance do turne me into flame. Call: Will not one of the other Ladies please Your high taste, Artops? Me thinkes those faces are Most faire, which are most easie of fruition. Neand: I am resolved to sound the true depth of Their errand. Call: And I. Arr: I thinke I shall submit, And make a Third. Neand. Peace, here they come; Me thinks Yon'd two by Sympathy already do Send Tickets to invite us to their Tents. SCÃNA II. To them Archidamus, Theagines, Meleager, Roxane, Barsene, Orithya, ThalÃ¦stris, Menalippe, Marthesia, like Amazons; Their faces discolour'd to a comely Browne. Arch. You truly show, Gracious Hippolyta, How much you are a Souldier, who can be Content with such rude Entertainment; where The most I could expresse, was, that you were Receiv'd into a Seige. Where my Distresses, And poverty, are faine to call Themselves Magnificent from what I lacke, but would Faine furnish out with Words, and say My Intent Was large, though my expression was but small. If ought hereafter make this place or Army Deserving of your stay, it must be your Owne selfe sufficient Goodnesse, which can put Splendid Names on Defects, And the faire Traine Y'have brought along with you. Whose Company, Transformes a Wilde Campe into your owne Court; And makes you at home in my poore Country. Rox. Sir, We hope you doe not thinke we came to feast, Or revell with You; For that you have exprest Even to a trespasse 'gainst our Discipline; Whilest taking us for Women, you forget W'are Souldiers too; And turne your Campe into A soft Receipt of Ladies. 'Tis against Our Countrey Custome to spend our Dayes in Banquets, Or Nights in Maskes; Our Times are more virile, And different from the rest of our soft Sex, Who doe divide Themselves betweene their Beddes, Glasses, Tyres, Dressings, and Discourse of Servants. We count our Houres oth' Night by severall Watches, And Releifes of our Sentinells; And reckon Our Houres oth' Day, not by our Feasts, but Marches. We know no Glasse but our owne Armour; Nor E're see our selves but ith' cleare Brightnesse of Our Sheilds, and Helmets; And then our Dressings are, Such as you See, a Sword, Bow, Shafts, and Quiver. Barsen. We came to helpe you fight, Sir, And to carry Deeds worthy of our Name home with us. 'Twill Be our reproach in History, if't be knowne We did nought in Bithynia, after all Our other great Atcheivements, but see playes; Passe the loose Houres in feasting; Know no fights But such as are Dramaticke, and proceed From the Invention of your Poets; who Kill onely on the Stage, and then revive Their slaughter'd persons in the Tiring-House. Orith: If with my Queenes leave, I may speake, Sir, If We vanquish not the Thracians, who are now Your Enemies, or give them battle: We Shall seeme a fleet of Gossips, who tooke shore, Onely to see, and to be seene; And so Returne Inglorious. Thal. Besides, Our Citizens Will count us Cowards; And weary to be governed By such faint, sluggish Princesses; will mutiny, Shake off the yoke of Subjects, and endanger To turne our Monarchy into a Many. Headed Democracy; And then you know What must needs follow where the State consists All of Plebeians; where that Beast the Rude Multitude rules, and none obey. Arch: You show Valours so much beyond your Sex, and stirre So just a shame, and blushing in us of Our owne unequall Courages, that I Must needs looke on you, not as you are Ladies, But warlike Goddesses stept downe from heaven; Each of you an Armed Pallas, to assist The just Cause of th'afflicted. Or if this Expresse you not; In each of you, Methinkes, I once more see Achilles like a Girle. And 'twill be Honour to me, when hereafter Posterity in Chronicle shall ranke me A sharer in your Actions; And my Conquests Shall run in story bound with yours. Not to Offend you therefore with ought effÅminate, Or what befits not you to see, or this Place to present, as one addition more To your entertainment I've provided A warlike Dance performed by Warlike Moores; Just in such postures as they adore their Gods, Before they goe to battle. Bid 'em enter. Here six Moores dance after the ancient Ãthiopian manner. Erect Arrowes stucke round their heads, in their curled haire, instead of Quivers. Their Bowes in their hands, Their upper parts naked; Their neather from the west, to their knees cover'd with bases of blew Sattin, edged with a deepe silver fringe. Their legs also naked, incircled with rings of gold; the like their Armes. Great pendants of Pearle at their eares. At every close, expressing a cheerefull Adoration of their Gods. My next care, Madam, shalbe to make these follies Passe into better spectacles. I will Send for the Ladies from their Castle. Your presence Will mak't a new delight t'enjoy the sounds, And roughnesse of the Campe. SCÃNA III. To them Lyncestes, Polydamas. Archid: âMy Lord Lyncestes, Polydamas. How doe the Ladies brooke Their Solitude? Have they not yet created One of themselves Preist to the Company, To say prayers twice a day for their releasement? Lync: Sure Sir, They were not Ladies, but a Crew Of Spirits; who appear'd like women, and A while wore humane faces made of lips, And eyes, and cheekes, &amp; dimples, to delude The easy sight of the beholders, and Then vanisht backe into themselves againe. Arch: They are not growne invisible. I hope; They've no enchanted Rings among 'em? Lync: Sir, I have sailed round your Coast, as farre as Water Would give me leaze; Have ransackt every Creeke, Examined every hole which would but lodge A Conger, or a Poore-John; And can finde No more print of them then Ships leave ith' Sea. Unlesse I should have hir'd your Negro's, Sir, Which I met here at doore to dive for 'em, As Indians do for pearle, in hope to finde 'em, Some forty Fathome deepe in Oyster shels, I know not where to seeke 'em. Arch: Are they lost then? Lync: Eurymedon in person with his Fleete Concealed, Sir, seized them in their passage over Into the Island; And whether he have sent 'em Home to Bizantium, or keepe them here His prisoners, is uncertaine. Polyd: The Report Had like t'have put Chalcedon, Sir, into A Civill Warre. The People of both Sexes, 'Till I allay'd them, were up in a Commotion. Arch: O my propheticke soule! which whisper'd me I should not trust 'em to an Element So false and treacherous. Theag: Are our two Ladies Vapour'd away ith' mist too, Sir, and seiz'd on? Lync: Yes, and their women; They have not left a beauty Ith' City; or ought which you can call handsome To breed upon, or to continue a Succession of good faces. Theag: I expect In time to see my wife returne then, with A race of little Thracians all noble by The bearers side. Meleag: And I that my Wife save me The future labout of begetting, and Without my helpe returne me a fine Troope And Squadron, which will call her Mother, and Me Captaine. Arch: Had he seiz'd my Crowne; or taken Me prisoner, and with me my Kingdome, It Had beene a losse I could have borne; And thought it One of the Chances which prove Princes subject To Mens Misfortunes. But to deprive me of Her, who to mee was Empire, Kingdome, Crowne, And all Things else, which make men happy; She Whose two eyes were the Sunnes that rul'd my Day, And to whom onely her Absence did make Night; She who smil'd virtue, and whose beauteous Lookes Were a soft, visible, Musicke, which entranc'd The lookers on, and strucke harmonious raptures Into every chast soule, and instill'd pure fires Int' every unchaste; She who had the power To charme feirce Tygers, and make Panthers tame, And civilize the wildest Salvage, but He who surpriz'd Her, and made his Sister, and My destined Queene part of his pyracy;â Thus to deprive me of my Joyes ith' porch, And entrance to them, is a wrong like that, Where the faire Bride is ravisht from the Bridegroome, Upon the Nuptiall Day; or where their Hands Are rudely sunder'd whilest the Preist is tying The holy Knot. But why doe I turne Woman, And adde to th'losse by my Complaints. You two Streight backe to th'City; Raise new Forces; Adde Wings to your expedition. I shall thinke Time moves not with its owne hast, 'till we give The Robbers Battle, and redeeme the prey. Ex: Lync: Polyd. Rox: Come, Sir, you shall divert the Thought of your Recoverable loosse at our Tent; where We will divide greifes with you, or finde wayes To make them wholly ours. Arch: Your Company Releives me, Madam; And I shall not thinke My selfe unfortunate in such a presence. Exeunt. SCÃNA. IV. Callias, Neander, Artops, Orithya, ThalÃ¦stris, Menalippe, Marthesia. Call. Ladies? Orith. Sir? Call. You don't train this afternoon, Or muster, doe you? Orith. Your reason Sir? Call: Because, If no Affaire of Discipline call on you To leave us, wee'd faine change some Campe Aire with you. Thal: W'are at full leisure, Sir. Call. Pray, Ladies, let us Be bold to aske you then, what places hold you In your Queenes Army? Doe you command the Foot, And Infantery? Or are you Cavaliers And Regents of the Horse? Orith: Why doe you aske? Call. Not out of curiosity, t'informe Our selves in your Arts Military; But onely Out of a free desire we have Commanders To be admitted servants to Commanders. Orith. How doe you meane? Nean. Troth, Ladies, to divert The Melancholly and Sadnesse which this Accident Will raise among us; we would gladly joine Souldiers with Souldiers, and make both Armies one. Thal: That's done already Sir. Art. Our meaning is, We would faine doe you civill Right, and pay you The debts of nature which you come for. Officers Mingling with Officers will raise a Race Of stout young Alexanders betweene them, who'l Once more subdue the world. Thal: Now you speake Without Clouds, we conceive you. Doe you thinke then, We come to seeke men to get children on us? Call. We hope y'are like your Mothers. We know, Ladies Without our Helpe you are but barren Things; And cannot propagate betweene your selves. Orith. Well, say this be our Errand, since you speake Soe understandingly; what would you doe To helpe us in Necessity? Neand: Doe? Why, What should we doe? Doe service to your Country; And strive to keepe you still a People, by A new succession of Amazons. Orith: But say They should prove males, Sir. Nean. Then breed them up to save you The trouble of such journies; and employ 'em, As you do us their Fathers, to th'publicke good. Thal: But 'tis against our Lawes to Foster, Sir, Male births. Neand: What do you with 'em? drown 'em then? Thal: Restore 'em to their getters. Would you receive 'em, If we should send 'em home? Neand: So they be borne Perfect; not halfe male, and halfe female; I'le Nurse no Hermaphrodites. Orith: Besides, you have Beene us'd to th'Ladies of your owne Court; you'l Ne're like our Company. We are not faire And beautifull enough to stirre your Loves To serve us in our needes. Art. By this hand, Ladies, I'me more inflam'd to see a certaine true, And Genuine smile creepe o're your Nutbrowne faces, And make a kinde of Day-breake there, then all The Artificiall whites and reds, laid on By our Court painters, who call't Beauty to Create their owne lookes. Thal. Are there such Arts, then? Call. You saw the two Lords here? Thol. Yes Sir, Call. They Have two young Ladies, whom I do question, whether They may call Wives, or Pictures. Neand. Their wedding day Saw them, perhaps, in their owne blushes; And They lay the first night in their unbought Roses; But ever since have varied shapes; scarce worne The same face twice. Who'd lye with such she Proteusses? Who change forme in the embrac; And do lye downe One Mistresse, and ith' morning rise another? Orith. Our lookes are course, but native, Sir. Nean. Y'are like The Times which Love delights in; we behold A faire night in your faces stucke with Stars. Call. Me thinks ye exceed the Queene of Love; she had But one blacke Mole, you are all but one faire Spot. Art. Beleeve it Ladies, were he not a boy, I'de say y'had brought each of you in those lovely, Darke, shady cheekes, a Cupid, who from thence, As from an amiable twilight, shootes His golden arrowes. Orith. You do expresse your selves So affectionate, so like loversâ Thal. So comply With our owne wishes, which are to requite Your love with loveâ Orith. And do so nobly know The wants of Ladies, and can as nobly pardon All their defects, that henceforth we'l expect Some entercourse of visit from you. Thal. We Shall long to see you at our poore Tents, choose Your owne times; We lock not our curtaines. Exeunt Ladies. SCÃNA V. To them Theagines and Meleager. Theag. What, laying siege to th'Ladies, Gentlemen? Call. Trying, my Lord, what Forts They weare; or where They are most easie to be Scal'd; We have yet But made an Attempt upon their Outworkes, and Held parley with them. Mel. And how, and how, in Troth, D'you find em? Tractable? Will They surrender On easie Compositian, without a long And tedious Battery? Neand. We find em made, As other Ladies are, of flesh and blood: I do perceive no difference, My Lords, Twixt Ayres, and Clymates; But where men meet women, Nature will have'ts Effects, for the preservation Oth' Universe: unlesse there should be some To aske, others to grant; some to beget, Others to bring forth, the World would have an end In the short Circle of one Age. Theag. I hope It is not come to that already; you have Had a quick victory, to see and conquer. Mel. Th'are very Waxen, sure, who take impression At the first chafing. Art. Waxen? Why I'le tell you, I never yet saw Things so yeelding, So Obedient to the Touch. I do beleeve, Should we dissemble coynesse, or stand out, They would put Questions to us; And upon Refusall, take Armes, and invade our Lodgings. And what would be the fruits of such a Warre, Back't with so good a Cause, your Lordships judge. Neand: Alas you must consider, Good my Lords, Necessity's a Tyrant. Had they Men In their owne Countrey to supply their Wants, Or were their State compos'd so, that without Danger to th'Commonwealth, there might be some Kept at the publique charge to lye with them, At th'Age of procreation, and so be The Fathers of their Country, whil'st they mingled Natives with Natives, It perhaps would seeme Immodest to seeke forraigne Helpe. But where Males are against the Law; And where to Marry Is worse then to commit; And where a Husband Is a Crime worse then Fornication; what In this Case would you have them doe? Call: Unlesse Nature had made them double, and enabled 'em To be both Sexes to themselves; Or else, Unlesse they could beare children, as we see, Our feilds beare flowers; Where one and the same Soyle, Water'd by a soft shower, or breath'd upon By a Warme Aire, is Father, Mother, All, To its owne Issue, How d'you thinke they should Produce posterity? Troth, My Lords, I feele A certaine generous pitty in me to Their reasonable Longings. Theag. Well, Gentlemen, You have convinc'd us. But doe you thinke the Two Princesses came for the same purpose? Art: As sure As we have leave, Sir, to make visits, or Choose our owne Nights with these departed Ladies. Mel: And have you? Art: Aske them. Neand. Troth my Lords, you'l have Work enough with your own two Ladies, when You next recover 'em; and therefore will not, We hope, disturbe us, who are single, in Our amorous courses. We are promis'd all The pleasures which their Tents can yeild: And told There shall be no lockes 'twixt us and our Joyes. SCÃNA. VI. To them Macrinus, Lacero, Serpix; Three totter'd common Souldiers, with a Drummer before them; And Cock-feathers in their Hats. Call. How now? What have we here? The Signe oth' Battle 'Twixt Time and Ragged Breeches? And whither now Tends your most totter'd March? What make your foure Halfe Doublets from your Colours? Macr. Sir, we are Imployed as publique persons, by our Companies, To tell the King our Greivances. Beat on To th'Kings Pavilion. Neand: Publique: 'Tis true, you are; Your Elbowes witnesse for you; There's not one Bare part about you that's not publique. But Pray stay, pray stay a little, Gentlemen; What Greivances have your most lousy valours To present now? Lac: Such, Sir, as we have often Complain'd to you of, and you'l not redresse us. Serp: The King is Just, Sir, and allowes us pay, Which you melt up by th'way. You may make sport, And laugh at our poore Ruines; But 'tis our Ragges, And barenesse, which doth make you glitter. Mac: If We had our Right, your large Scarfes, every one Of which display'd, would make the Colours to A Company, should be our Shirts. Art. How, Sir? Lac: Sir, it is true; And your large Feathers, each Of which, wav'd by the Winde, does make you walke In perfect flourish; And present you like Three winged Dedalus's, prepar'd to fly, Should be our Coates, and plume us. Ser. And that shine And blaze of plate about you, which puts out Our eyes, when we march 'gainst the Sunne, and armes you Compleatly with your owne gold Lace, which is Laid on so thicke, that your owne Trimmings doe Render you Engine proofe, without more Armes, Should goe to buy us bread. Art. This is most rare With reference to the Feathers in your Hats, Most pilfring Gentlemen, which show you have Skirmished with Neighbouring poultry, lately, and having Eaten part of your Conquest; weare the rest As Emblems of your wandring from the Campe, And Inrodes on Backsides. If I may aske you, Where have you learnt this Eloquence? I do not Read that Demosthenes declaym'd with Toes Looking through leather Casements. Or that He was Sent in an Embassie with halfe a Stockin, Or such decay'd Caparisons, as I Observe in your retinue. Macr. Sir, wee need No Teacher but our wants to find us words. Lacer. Had you Three reckon'd th'Age oth' Warre by fasting As we have done; who by our hunger know 'Tis now a month since it began; or did you Know onely these two poore Releefes, Warme daies For Clothes, Warme Ayre for food. Serp. Or had you Beene Three Camerades like us, Three daies to one. Dryed Bisket, and borne Stock fish, both which might Be shot for Battery, And for hardnesse be Reckon'd into th'Artillery, we doe Beleeve you would not starve in silence; Or Depart this life without some Testimony That you were famisht hence. Call. Why harke you, you Rascalls, who thinke the life of man consists In eating; And that you were sent into the world To devoure Flocks and Heards; what are you made for? Resolve mee, if you can; What is the End Of your Creation, but to fight, Goe naked, And starve in Sun shine? Neand. True; what other use Can there be of you in a State, but either To be hang'd if you steale, if you do not To suffer hunger, and be lowsie in Your Countries Cause? And if you scape the Sword, And do survive, to be a Burthen to The Common wealth, to be dispatcht by famine, for the publique ease? Art. Besides, why do you trouble Us with your meager visages? what are Your torne necessities to us? Mac. Does not Our pay passe through your hands? Are not you our Captains? Art: And are there no wayes, Sir, to live, besides Your foure and eight pence weekely? Lac: Wee'd be glad To learne them, Sir. Art: Pray let me aske you, then, And answer with discretion. What is The naturall use of Capons, Hens, and Geese? For what serve Turkies? Mac: To be eaten. Art: Right; You and I jumpe. And what's the use of Sheep? I do not meane with fleeces; (That falls under Another question:) But as they are Mutton? Lac: Why to be eaten too. Art: Still right. And lastly, What is the use of Wooll made into Cloth? Is't not to cover? Serp: 'Tis so, Sir, Art: And what's The use of Plate and Money? Is't not to Supply Mens Wants, and buy the things they need? Serp: Most true Sir, Art: And are these times which do make The stealth of all these lawfull,And reach out All these unto you for the venturing: And Are you so cowardly, or rather so In love with your owne Lice, that you must aske Us for releife? Or thinke of such a base, Poore, contemptible thing as Pay? Mac: Is this The answer you will give us? Art: This is all. Plundering's a large Revenue; 'Tis your owne Fault if Townes cloth you not; Or if the Fields Afford you not provision. Mac: We must then Here let you know, wee'l Mutiny. Beat backe. Call: You Mutiny, you ill fac'd Rascals; Have you A minde to cheat the Hangman with your Wardrobes? Or an itch to disgrace the Gibbet with Your Goblin Carkasses before your times? Lac: Wee'l raise the Campe against you. Serp: Come, let's raise Let's raise the Campe. Neand: Away you heaps of vermin. Earth your selves in your Trenches; And there live The quiet life of Meles; Feed on the Rootes. Ex: Mac: Lac: Ser: Of wholsome hearbs which grow about you Goe. Call. My Lords, we must take leave. Art: You see the peace Oth' Army lyes on't. Neand: We kisse your Lordships hands. Exeunt. SCÃNA VII. Theagines, Meleager, To them Menalippe, Marthesia. Theag: Why here be three new Captaines now, who make The Right use of the Warre. Spend their Assaults On such soft, harmelesse, yeilding Things, as Ladies, And keepe Themselves in Spangles, with the pay Of their poore Souldiers. Mel: It appeares to me Strange what Designe should cast these Amazons Upon our shore. I hope they have no Aime To take Advantage of our fight; or keepe Themselves Spectatours 'till both Armies have Weaken'd Themselves, and then ore'come the Victours. I would be loath to have if said in story, We were subdu'd by Women with one Breast. And it would trouble me to see my selfe Led Captive; And transported to a Land Where I must propagate at the mercy of Those who did take me prisoner; And get Children By th'night, and taske, upon my Conquerours. Theag. Beleiv't their project is lesse politicke. You heare the Errand they come for is to Lye with us in our Land. Mel: Still 'tis strange They should so quickly open, And reveale Themselves so easy, so prepared, as these Three make 'em. Theag: Pray Heaven, my Lord, our Ladies Show not themselves as easy, and as pliant, Ith' other Campe. 'Tis true indeed, their case Is not the same. They've had no Dearth of Husbands, Which shou'd invite 'em to require Releife From th'Enemy. But if they should conclude A peace for us; And if one of the Articles Be, to give something they can spare, and we Not misse, we cannot helpe it if they show Themselves good patriots; And preferre their Countrey Before our private Interests; or their More private Honesties. Mel: True; 'Tis but loosing A little Honour for the publique Good; And Honours but a Word; We shall not be Impoverisht by the losse. All parts in Women Are like their lippes; And lippes you know are Springs. If a whole Army quench their Thirst there, still As much is left as taken; The first stocke Ent. Menal. Marth. Remaines entire. Theag. My Lord, Behold; what say You to a Message now? Mel: I'me now confirm'd. Men: Are you my Lord Theagines? Theag: Yes Lady. Marth: And you my Lord Meleager? Mel: 'Tis my nameâ. Men: Y'are oth' Bedchamber to th'King? Mel: We are so. They have had good Intelligence. Marth: Our Ladies Hearing y'are noble, and delighting much In persons valiant, and of great Action, (as They are informed you are) will take it for An honour, if you will vouchsafe to be Oth' Bedchamber to them too, for the space Of a short visit. Men. They say they doe long, Long, very much t'impart a businesse to you. Thea: You doe not know what 'tis? Men. Sir, it requires The secrecy of their Tents to know it. Mel: When Pray, is the time they'd be at leisure, Ladies, For us to waite upon 'em? Marth: At all times, Sir, They say you cannot erre. Onely they will Tak't as the greater favour, If to beguile The tedious houres with discourse of the Ancients, And the Comparison of Womens deeds, With those of Men, you will divide your Nights, Sometimes with them. Men: But cheifly, they desire You would now come along with us. Thea. My Lord, What would come on't if we Two should suppose Our selves unmarried? Our Wives when we next meet, If before hand they not requite us) will Finde us whole Husbands. Mel: I am resolv'd to make Use of the Opportunity. The worst That can befall us, if our Ladies know it, Is to seale mutuall pardons. Theag: Come, Ladies, you Shall be our Clue to guide us. Men: We will lead you Into a pleasing Labarynth. Mel: 'Twill be Our wish to be lost in such Company.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS IV. SCÃNA I. Archidamus, Roxane, Barsene, Orithya, Thelastris. Rox: Come, Sir, wee are resolved, if't be ith' power Of Ladies to effect it, to cure you of Your sadnesse, you no longer shall afflict Us and your selfe with melancholly. It does not Show princely in you, thus to enthrall your selfe To th'Memory of a Woman. We thought to finde you A Warriour; One in whose stout brest so poore So effÅminate a thing as Love, or the Losse of a Mistresse, would have past among Those ordinary Cares, which are at once Consider'd and forgotten. Bars: 'Tis for subjects To affect Constancy, or melt and pine, And breath themselves away ith' Contemplation Of those they Love; Or to affect Lone walkes, There raise an Idoll to themselves, And then Fall downe and worship it. Y'have turn'd your Campe Into a Cloyster, Sir. And are retir'd Ith' mid'st of Legions. Nor can we imagine We have your Company, when present with us, Your thoughts are so away. Arch: Had you e're seene The wondrous object that attracts them, or Discern'd the secret influences, which Passe from her soule to mine, and mingled there, In one strict union, at this distance make us So much each others as to have no power T'untwist our selves, or have the leisure to Looke towards ought which weares not her faire shape To me, or mine to her, you might as well Condition with the passive Iron not To turne to th'Loadstone; Or chide the Needle for Moving towards the bright pole, as accuse me For thinking on Roxane. I confesse, Bright Princesses, 'Tis Love that makes me rude; And but I hope you have brought pardons with you, And can forgive one robb'd of his free selfe, Nor left to his owne Carriage; I should count Those Houres which I have stollen from you, to pay Devotion unto Her, a Sacriledge Committed 'gainst your Beauties; Or a Theft, Which doth take Worship from one Goddesse to Consume it on Another. Rox. Wee'l allow Roxane, Sir, (For so I doe perceive You call your Princesse) To be all that a Prince In Love can fancy faire, or amiable; (Yet I must tell you too, Love's a false glasse, Which still showes things much fairer then they are.) Wee'l grant all your Descriptions true, that to Her Fairenesse she hath Virtues, which doe adde A Beauty to her Beauty, and render her One, pure, through, rich Gemme, which entirely is Nothing but Worth and Luster; yet if this Gemme Be dropt into the Sea, or lost ith' vast Chaos of Waves, will make warre with Nature, Or force the Ocean to restore your Jewell Made Irrecoverable? Arch. Doe you then looke Upon my losse no otherwise? Rox: Not, when I weigh her Brothers power; Th'uncertaine Chances Of Warres like this; The many Subjects lives, Which must be sacrific'd to her recovery. The most you can expect if you prevaile, Is that your Nuptialls should be mixt with slaughters; And that your Marriage Tapers should be kindl'd From funerall piles; And so Roxanes Wedding, Thus ravish't to and fro, like Proserpines, Ith' under World, be kept 'mongst Ghosts and shades. Bars: Besides, how are you sure your constancy Is answer'd, Sir, with constancy? Our hearts Are changeable; nor do I see why Princes Should be lesse fraile then others, who confine Affection to the sight, since Love's a fire Which doth not onely languish, and goe out, Where fuell is subtracted, But is kept burning Onely ith' presence of another fire. Arch: Ile rather thinke nature can change her Course Rivers run backwards from the Ocean, Things heavy can fly up, and light fall downe; Or that the Heavenly Orbes can vary, and By shuffling of themselves, the higher with lower, Loose their first Order, and in this confusion Wheele round in Discord, as before in Musicke, Then she can cease to Love me. Roxane is To me a Vestall, and I one to her; There's but one holy flame betweene us, which Cannot expire but with our selves. Rox: But you'l Allow there may, Sir, be degrees in Love; And that a lesser fire ought to give way In justice to a greater; And though not quench't, Yeild it selfe swallowed by it. Arch: Madam, pray Explaine your selfe. Rox: Say, then, Archidamus, (For now I will be free) there should be those, Who though they bring no bright Starres in their eyes, Or such charmes in their faces, as Roxane, (Which to affect, were to take fire from lookes, And love by th'sense, and outside, not by th'minde.) Yet being of equall birth, of as great vertues, Of greater Dowries, (For those I speake of Do with a Kingdome bring their Conquests too) But above all (for they dare strive here, and Account themselves superiour) say they should bring Greater Affection; And to shew they do, No longer able to conceale their Flames, Should lay aside their Sex, and Act your part, And tell you that they love you; Would such deserve A repulse from you? Or could you, Sir, to gaine The name and stile of Constant unto one, Be unjust to two? And not repay their flame With such another? Arch: There can be no such, Madam. Bars: Without more Cloudes, say, Sir, we be those two? Arch: You, Ladies? You are fit to conquer Princes; And t'have the Gods steale downe in waried shapes, To beget Hero's on you and halfe Gods; Not to betray such weake affections as To sue to those who do adore you. Besides, You two admit no choice, where both are equall, Both Twinnes in their perfections, as in birth, Unlesse I could divide my selfe, and be Two to you Two. (for here is no election Of one without wrong to the other) And Could multiply my selfe into a number, How can I answer both? Rox: By choosing one. We are agreed betweene our selves; she that's Refus'd, shall home, and weare the Crowne, the other Stay here and be your Queene. Arch: O Love! why as Thou dost weave knots, doest thou not teach a way How to unty them too? I do confesse My selfe lost in a sweet perplexity. I'me now the Prince 'fore whom three Goddesses Strove for the Golden Ball, or which should be Preferr'd for Beauty. When I do consider Your severall shapes, I am snatch't severall wayes; And am at once three Lovers. If I therefore, Amidst such equall merits, can't make choice Of one before the other, 'Tis because I am not blinde. Where Objects are alike Faire, and distracting, He must want his eyes Who doth preferre. Rox: Wee'l give you this nights respite To thinke upon election. Meane time, Sir, There's a short Banquet waites you at our Tent. Arch: You'l be the Musicke to it. Orith: Madam, Now your Play's done, ours will begin; we doe Onely want stage room. Bars. Look you play your parts well. Thal: As well as our Hypocrisie &amp; false faces Will give us leave. âOrithya, what d'you thinke Oth' Prince's Constancy? should he be tempted To leave Roxane for Roxane, and make Choyce of the Disguised for the true, 'twould prove A fine Ginne laid to prove men fraile, and subject To our Infirmities. Orith. I know not how This tedious ScÅne of Love hath wrought on him; But it to me was Opium, and raised slumber. A Gentle murmure did glide by my ears Like the soft fall of Streames. A little more Of such slight, aÃ«ry stuffe, had bound my senses Up in a perfect sleepe. Thal. I did observe The Onsets, &amp; Replyes too; Methought they ran In Artops &amp; Neanders candid stile, When they doe court our Women in Milke-verse, Or tell them Newes or Stories in Sonnet prose. I should ne're be thus cruell to him I love, To show him shades in stead of substance; 'Tis, Methinkes embracing Clouds. SCÃNA. II. To them Menalippe, Marthesia. Lights, and a Banquet follow. Men. âMadam, your great Designe Goes rarely on. Your Lords are come, and are Disposing of their Ambush. Orith: And have you, Menalippe, Bespoke the false Alarme at the just houre? Men: Clockes strike not dulier after Quarters, Madam, Then our she Drummer will observe her Cue, And make things dreadfull. Thal: Marthesia, stand you Sentinell Against they come. Mar. Troth, Madam, 'tis to me A ComÅdy before hand to imagine How they will beare th'affright. Men. Methinkes I see 'em Rolling themselves up in their owne gold Lace, Like Urchines in their prickles. Or wishing to Exchange place with their swords, and case themselves In their owne scabberds. Mar. Stand, who comes there? Thal: There they are; Goe Menalippe bid the Lords With their stout Squadron, observe their Entrances. Exit Menal. SCÃNA III. To them at doore first, afterwards enter'd Call: Neand: Art: Call. You'l not exact the Word of us, I hope, My pretty Perdue Virgin; if you doe, Pray call your Corporall. Neand: We doe not come As Spyes; If you suspect, commit us to Your Ladies. Art. Or else keepe us prisoners in Your Corpes of Guard, till they release us. Marth. Now, I know y'are freinds, you may passe. I was set Here to attend your coming; To prevent Your danger of mistaking the right Tent. Call. We should have found that by Instinct. Neand. Bright Ladies, We have made bold to use the Liberty You gave us; And try what campe houres you keepe. Art: I hope w'are not unseasonable; we Came, Ladies, to keepe watch with you. Orith. The time Oth' night addes to our visit; Had you come By day, y'had brought but halfe your selves, and onely Made visit to our eyes; where all that could Have past, had beene to see, and to be seene. Art: True, Ladies, whereas now you have us all; And other Senses may be pleased too; And Goe sharers with the sight. Thal. Besides, The Day Turnes all Things into Chrystall, Sir; Our Tents Had beene transparent, like their Silkes; And we Had not beene private in our Closets. Neand. Right; Whereas the Night turnes all Things into Shade; And drawes Jet curtaines 'bout our pleasures; And Makes a faire Lady invisible in ones Armes. Orith: Will you vouchsafe to sit and taste of this Slight Banquet, Gentlemen. Call: You make it Three. Thal. You do not reckon us 'mongst Marmalade, Quinces, and Apricots? or take us for Ladies preserved? Call: No Ladies; yet I hope 'Tis no offence to say y'are each of you A various Banquet, where a breathing sweetnesse Feasts the Spectatours; And diverts all thought Of eating to beholding; And from beholding T'enjoying. Neand: All these do take value, Not from the Art, which joyn'd to nature, made 'em, But from you who bestow 'em. These Cherries do Take Colour from your Lippes; This Amber casts A perfume from your Breath; what ere's delightfull In them reflects from you. Art: And least there should Be Musicke wanting to this Banquet, when You speake, the Syrens sing Orith. Y'have brought, we see, The art to flatter and dissemble with you. Thal: I now begin to feare you. It can't be You should thus faine and love us. Neand: Not love you, Ladies? Why what signes would you have? What is required To Love which we would not performe? Thal: Would you Fight for us, if need were? Orith: Or enter duell In Defence of our Honours? Neand: Would we? By This hand, should you command, we would, our selves Alone, now venture on the Thracian Campe. Call: Or presently send challenges to Nine Of their best Captaines, to fight Three to One. Art: We will do more then fight; with your faire leaves, We will get Fighters on you. Orith. Is that your errand? Art: That, and to helpe away the Solitude And tediousnesse oth' night. Thal: Well, since we do Beleeve you valiant, and worthy of our favours, How will you order things? Three to two Women Is one to much: Orith. One must stand out; unlesse You'l take the Centinell in for a Third. To men of your indifferent purposes It should be all one; she's of the right Sex. Neand: We'l draw cuts who shall have her. What say you My pretty Diomed oth' Cawdles, will you For one night lay aside your contemplations They draw Lots. How to take Towne in Marchpane; or expresse The Siege of Thebes, or Travels of Ulisses In sweet meats, And make one of us? Mar: I'le take My fortune Sir, Neand: Artops, She's yours; I did PrÃ¦sage thy melting Hymnes, and Straines, would end In a Corne-Cutter. Art. She is not fifty Sir, Nor I the fifteenth in succession, to A Flavia, who brings manchet to the Campe; This is no Sutlers wife. Thal: Go wench prepare The Beds. Orith: But should you, now, reveale, or rumour Your Entertainment. Call: Do you thinke us ill-bred Rascals? Fellowes that can't conceale? Thal: Or should you tell How kind, how free you found us how we used youâ An Alarme within. Ne. We'l rather cut our tongues out &amp; live speechles. Ori: Hark, what meanes this? Tha: The Camp is up in Armes. SCÃNA. IV. To them Menalippe, and Marthesia, in show frighted, Afterwards Theagines, and Meleager, at one Doore; Macrinus, Lacero, Serpix at another; all disguis'd. Men: Fly, Madams fly, we are betrayed. Mar: The enemy Hath seiz'd upon the Works; taken the King; Burnt our Queenes Tent; slaine all the Captaines; and is Now marching hither. Orith: Now show your valours, And Helpe to defend those whom you Love. Call. Alas, Ladies; You can fight for your selves. This is the first Time we e're saw the Field. Neand: Alas what can Three doe against an Army? Thal: Will you not Then draw your weapons. But stand like worsted Captaines In Arras? Orith: Will you let us and your selves Be taken and make no resistance? or will you Be killed like people in their sleepe? Neand: 'Lasse, Ladies, What would you have us doe? we have beene borne And bred in peace, and were ne're us'd to fighting. Orith. O more then Women Cowards! And will you dye Clashing of Sword within. Like men oth' peace to? Ar. Hark, swords, swords; they come. Thal. Why doe you quake? why doe you looke about you? Would you faine hide your selves? Art. Hark swords again. Orith. If you will, There's an old Drum yonder, with One head, wee'l whelm it over you. Art. Thank you, Ladies. Thal. Or packe you up in one oth' Waggons, with A bare Hide over you, where you may passe For Cheese, or Ammunition. Call. 'Twill doe well. Men. Or, Madam, what if we pull'd downe our Tents, And wrapt them up ith' Curtaines? Neand. 'Twill do better. Theag. within. You Three take that way, we'l take this; slay all Enter The: Mel: Mac: Lac: Serp: That will not yeild. Art. Oh! here they come The. what? flying? Taking wing? Seize these Captaines; And disarme 'em. Mel. Ladies, we doe intend no warre against you. Our Quarrels are with men. Theag: Doe they refuse? They disarme 'em. Show them Campe Law. Call. We doe not, Sir, there Freind, There is my Sword. Neand. And there is mine; pray use Me like a Gentleman. Serp. Come, Sir, you part As slowly with your sword, as that with th'Scabberd. Macr. Y'have no Artillery in your pocket, have you, That will o'retake men at a Distance, and Arrest 'em at Fivescore? Nea. Sure Freind there's all. The. Next blind their eies with their own scarfs. Mac. Hold G?tlemen. Hold your heads faire, &amp; shut your eyes, that we They blind 'em. May close 'em double. Lac. Stir not as you desire To keepe 'em in your Head, and not put out. Call. We doe not, Sir. Serp. So; There's one Darknesse more Then that we caught you in. Theag. Now lead 'em bound To th'other Captives; And attend the Councell Of Warre with 'em ith' morning. Mac. Come Gentlemen. Exeunt. SCÃNA. V. Theagines, Meleager, Orithya, ThalÃ¦stris, Menalippe, Marthesia. Theag: Ladies, you see we've kept our Words; The Houres Did fly with leaden Wings 'till we did earne The sweet Rewards y'have promised. Mel: Next unto The thought of this nights Raptures, which you will Inspire into our soules, we doe take pleasure To be thought worthy to be Actours in Your just revenge. Orith: My Lords, we looke on you As those we dare trust; such as understand What Ladies favours are, How merited; And withall, how to be concealed. Love hath His Mysteries, as well as shrines, &amp; Temples; To which a Secrecy is due; And th'are Profaned when publisht. Thal: Besides, you are our Equals; And though we cannot call you Husbands, yet To reape the fruit of Husbands from you, will be No staine, or blemish to us. But could you thinke us, So vulgar, so indifferent, so hard driven, In making our Elections, to defile The Honours of our Beds with those who next Would finde us Bodies? Orith: Especially, with those Who'd make our Nights the Discourse of Their Dayes. And so they might gaine credit by our favours, Would prostitute our Fames; And when They did not Enjoy our persons, would call't new pleasures to Lye with our Reputations. Thal: What would These Three Parcell-guilt silken Gentlemen have said Had They possest us, who so freely boasted The leave we gave them to make visits to us? As if to show good breeding were a Crime; Or to be Civill in a strange place. Theag: True Ladies; They said you were the most strange easy Things; So inclining to Mankinde, as if you had A purpose to disperse Bills through the Campe, T'invite Men to your Lodgings; And would propose Rewards to them who best performed. Thal. They said You had two Ladies too, which did use painting; And ne're wore their owne faces; But did vary Shapes every Morning; And goe forth of their Closets Things of their owne Creation. Orith. They left it Doubtfull too, and to be suspected, as if Your Ladies loved Plurality; And that they At Court did goe halfe Husbands with you. Mel. Well, Halfe our Revenge is past; The other Halfe We will contrive betweene your Melting Armes. Orith: You two sing us asleepe; And when y'have done, Goe walke the Round, and see the Watch releived. Exeunt. The first Song, sung by Two Amazons. (1) Time is a feather'd Thing; And whilest I praise The sparklings of thy Lookes, and call them Rayes, Takes Wing; Leaving behind him as He flyes, An unperceived Dimnesse in thine eyes. His Minutes whilst th'are told, Doe make us old; And every Sand of his fleet Glasse, Increasing Age as it doth passe, Insensibly sowes wrinkles there, Where Flowers and Roses doe appeare. Whilest we doe speake our fire Doth into Ice expire. Flames turne to Frost; And e're we can Know how our Crow turnes Swan, Or how a Silver Snow Springs there where Jet did grow, Our fading Spring is in dull Winter lost. (2) Since, then, the Night hath hurl'd Darknesse, Loves shade, Over its Enemy the Day, and made The World, Just such a blind and shapelesse Thing, As 'twas before Light did from Darknesse spring; Let me imploy its treasure, And make shade pleasure; Let's number out the Houres by Blisses, And count the Minutes by our Kisses. Let the Heavens new Motions feele; And by our Imbraces wheele. And whil'st we try the Way, By which Love doth convey Soule into Soule; And mingling so, Makes them such Raptures know, As makes them entranced lye In mutuall Extasy: Let the Harmonious Spheares in Musicke rowle. Ex: Men: &amp; Marth: SCÃNA. VI. Having changed Clothes to their Doublets, Enter Callias, Neander, Artops. Their eyes blinded with blacke patches; led by Macrinus, Lacero, Serpix. Macr: Come Gentlemen, Without Resistance now Disrobe your upper parts. What's wanting in Good Clothes, your patience must supply. Lac: Good Troth Your Doublets suite not with your Breeches; Rents To Rents, And Ragges to Ragges in fashionable. But as y'are now you looke like Men of Gold Creeping forth of your Oare; And are the Emblems Of that State which does know no middle Subjects, But is compos'd wholly of Lords and Beggers. Call: Well, Sir, Neccessity which made you feed They change Doublets. The Numerous Thracians, which now feed on me In these your Breeches, And draw bloud, which is Against Campe Law, does here perswade me to Resigne my Doublet; pray shake yours, Sir. Neand: There, My Freind, who e're you are, There is whole plunder. Pray, if you can, spare me a Doublet which Hath Linings in't, and no Glasse-Windowes. For if My feeling doe not faile me with my sight, Your Nether Garment is halfe Net, halfe Breeches; And Statutably will catch Greater Fish, And let small passe, as well as cloth. Lac: Troth, Sir, You shall e'en have 'em as I wore 'em, fellowes; They were New once; It was not in my power To keepe them at a stand, by Miracle. Time which devour'd his Children, will eate Holes, Sir. Art: Stay, stay, stay, stay Freind: Sure you must release My eyes, to see to put your Vesture on right. Serp: I warrant you, Sir. Art: So; There is one Arme Past through a Labyrinth. I doe expect The Other should be lost by th'way. This Jerkin Is wholly made of Doores; And had need have A Thread belong to it. Serp: Now 'tis on, Sir. Art. Thank you. Y'are sure y'have not mistaken? Serp. How d'you meane? Art: I meane your Breeches for your Doublet; As being Indifferent in their use; which should be worne Above, and which below? Serp. All's right, Beleive it, Sir. Mac: Next, Gentlemen, you must once more submit Your Armes to these Hempe prisons. No striving; You Know where you are. Call. Sir, we are tame; y'have made us So by the Imprisonment of our Legges already. They pinion them. But if our Elbowes doe breake prison, pray Impute it to the loosenesse of your buildings. Lac: So; Now y'are All Compleate; you look't before Like Him who first invented Coaches, to hide His double Making; Who was downwards Serpent, Upwards a well shap't Man. Serp. Good troth, Me thought, Your Nether parts lookt as They would petition Your Upper for an Almes; Or else, as if You had 'bove Girdle beene the Founders, and Below, the Hospitall. Call: Well, Freinds, you may Laugh at our Miseries, and raise sport from Your torne Exchanges. But is this noble usage Of Souldiers unto Souldiers, thus to strippe us? Mac: When we take sheepe with golden Flecees, 'Tis Our Custome to returne Wool for their Plate. Lac: We doe not strippe you, but change Cases; Clothes For Clothes was still held honourable. Neand: And now, In troth, most Worthy Captaines, (For we have Created you) what's your Intent? what will you Doe with us thus reduced to Totters? Mac: That Is as the Councell shall determine. Perhaps, Imploy you in our Workes to digge: And there Worke out your Ransomes, 'till the Warre be ended, As pioners. Neand: Must we rowle Wheele-barrowes? Or manage Spades, and Mattockes then? And earne Our bread and water with the Picke-Axe? Serp: Perhaps, We shall obtaine you outright for our Slaves. Then having mark't you, to be knowne our Bond-men, We will transport you home to Thrace, and there Make sale of you in some publique Market; you'l Be vendible Commodities. Perhaps, Some who have store of Wives will buy you to Make Eunushes of, and geld you. Mac: Or perhaps Some Ancient Widdowes, long past bearing, will Buy you for their owne private use. Las: Or else, Perhaps, to make short worke, The Councell will Condemne you to the Gallies, There to row Your Dayes our 'gainst the Persian; or fetch Corne Monthly from Ãgypt: Sugar from Creet: or Spunges From Samos. Art: And our Wages to be feele The scourge about our shoulders if the Winde Sit opposite, &amp; we can't row. Lac: There must Be such corrections, to quicken Diligence. Call. Pray as y'are noble, and know how to pity Humane Misfortunes, let us aske one Question. Mac: As many as you please. Call. If by Starre-light You can discerne so farre, How farre are we From a Tall Oake, which may be clymb'd by such Ivyes as we? Or a straight Elme, which may Support th'Imbraces of such Vines? Mac: Why aske you? Call: Because if any such kinde naturall plant Be neare, we would intreat you not t'omit The Opportunity; But to prevent Our Greater by lesse sufferings, would imploy Those Cords which binde our Armes, about our Necks, And hang us up by Mooneshine. Mac: Alas, such favours Are not in our powers. If it be your fate So to be sentenc'd, we will doe you all The freindly Offices we can. Call: We thanke you. Lac: Meane time, perhaps to you 'til Midnight, Gentlemen; No Sunne appeares to you: But to us Day breakes. We will conduct you to the place where you Shall know your Doomes. Pray follow leisurely. And doe not stumble. Neand: If't be our Destiny To dye by th'string, the comfort is w'are Three.</field>

Theag: In my opinion, my Lord, these are The strangest Amazons that ever left Their female Countrey for the use of Men. How did you finde yours? Mine had Breasts. Mel. Troth mine, I thinke hath scap't the rasour too; I had No leisure to examine parts. I found No defects in her; But methought she was To me a whole and perfect Woman; I'me sure She found me an entire and perfect Man. Theag: There's a strange sweetnesse in them; how they melt Betweene ones Armes, and call one Husband? Mel: I Thought mine would have fullfill'd the Fable, where The Nymph dissolv'd into a Fountaine. Theag: But How will our Ladies brooke this if they know it? Mel: How? Thanke us for being Civil unto Ladies. Would they be willing these should report us Clownes? O: men void of Humanity, at their Returne home to their Countrey. Theag: 'Tis true; had we Dismist them as they came, both to our shame, And shame of our posterity, they might Record us Impotent in Chronicles; Or say they were receiv'd Women by Women. Enter Orith. Thal. Mel. Here they come. Ladies, you appeare to us Like Two Sunne risings breaking from your Curtaines. Theag: The Day 'till now was not begun; you make The Morning, which enables us to see Those Beauties by their owne light, which did turne The Darkenesse of the Night into such pleasure, As happy Lovers doe enjoy below, In their Elysian Feilds. Orith: Fye, fye, my Lords, Is this your recompence to mocke us for Having bad faces? Thal: 'Cause Nature play'd the Stepdame, And made us not of the same Orient matter Of which she fram'd your Ladies, Must you adde Your flouts to her hard Workmanship? Theag: 'Fore Heaven I could for ever gaze on your faire eyes. 'Tis Heaven, where e're I may behold your faces; Y'are wholly made of charme. Mel: You are two Circes, Two amiable Conjurers; Once gotten Into your Circle, there's no getting out: A Thousand Graces play upon your lips, And every Kisse is a new Syren, which Invites us to take more, and there to fix, Till they grow Infinite. Theag: Then for your beds, They are two PhÅnix Nests which breath perfumes; You rose from us, to Day, as Spice from Altars, Two perfect Sacrifices. Orith. Well, since you will Needs put great value on slight favours, we Shall know how you esteeme us by your visits In this kinde often. Thal. Next, That you may perceive What Confidence we dare put in you; And How ill it would become us to admit You to our Beds, and shut you from our Counsels: Know that this Day, if you doe not prevent it, Your Campe will be betray'd to th'Enemy. Theag: How Ladies? 'Tis not possible; pray who Should be the Traitors? Orith: Our Princesse, and her Sister. You stand amazed now. Theag. Troth it stirres my wonder, Treason should lodge in such fair Lookes. Thal. These Lookes Are, Sir, the Cause, and Ground of what we tell you. Your King ignobly did refuse them, when They fell below Themselves, and wooed Him. Orith. Which Being knowne to th'Prince of Thrace, he joining Love To their Revenge, hath frequently stolne hither In a Disguise, and courted, &amp; prevailed. This Morning is appointed as the last Time of their Interveiwes, before the Nuptialls. Thal. 'Tis too concluded, Sir, He shall restore Your Princesse, (For He sayes, To force Affection, Were to wedde halfe a Queene, and match her Body Without her Soule, Nor can the Marriage be Perfect where Mindes joine not as well as hands, And have their Knot too) And in her stead shall Make choice of one of ours. Orith. Then for Roxane, Hee'l transport her backe, as scorning To match there where Himselfe hath beene refused. And for the Carriage of all this, 'Tis Order'd That when the Battles joine, we, on the Word, And Signe given, shall revolt, and turne to that side. Mel. You have made great Discoveries. Theag. Who is this? Eurymedon passeth by. Orith. Now trust your owne eyes; That's Eurymedon, Going to our Queenes Tent. Make what wise use Of this you please. And say you have not lost By th'Company of Ladies. Theag. We looke upon you As the preservers of our Countrey. Mel. We Ent. Menalippe &amp; Marthesia. Will erect Sacred Statues to you, as To th'Tutelar Deities that saved us. Men. Madam, Here is the second part oth' ComÅdy. The Souldiers are come with their prisoners: The strangest spectacleâ Orith. Why, what's the Matter? Mar. Unlesse it were the Farse, where the Decayes Of Time are acted, I never saw three men So made of Ragges. The Souldiers have changed Clothes, And plunder'd 'em. Thal. Go bid 'em enter. Mel. Come Ladies Wee'l make two in your Councell, And then to th'King. SCÃNA II. To them Callias, Neander, Artops: (Led by Macrinus, Lacero, Serpix. Macr. Come Gentlemen, now stand in Ranke, and keepe Due Distance from the Lords; Lest there passe from you A creeping Entercourse, which may disturbe The sitting of the Court. Theag. Are these the Captaines You tooke last Night? Mac. These are the Three Commanders An't please your Lordships; who have since chang'd shapes With us their Conquerors. Mel. Indeed They looke As if They lately had beene in a Fight; Their Garments doe want Surgeons. What's your name? Cal. Callias Me. What's yours? Ne: Neander. Me. What's yours? Art: Artops. Theag. I do remember you; you were imploy'd In our late Civill Warres, by the factious Members Of our Synedrium, when they arm'd their slaves, And made their Bondmen Curiasseirs against Th'Equestrall Order; And did enact it lawfull Ith' Kings Name to take Armes against Him; And Out of Obedience to Him to rebell. And 'mongst their other Wilde and furious Votes, Decreed it lawfull, for the Good oth' Subject, To rifle their Estates; slaughter their persons; Ravish their Wives, and to defloure their Daughters. Mel. Are these the Three, who helpt to make war 'gainst Our Gods? And to reforme their Temples, did Deface their Altars? And called it sacrifice To robbe Them of their Incense, And pull downe Their Images? And did erect strange Preists, Taken from Awles and Anvills, to deliver False Oracles unto the people? Theag: These Sir, are the Three. Mel: Apply the Racke to them, To force true Answers from them to our Questions. Call. Pray hold, pray hold, Freinds. Alas, My Lords, we are not The men you meane. We ne're saw Warres before, Civill, or Forraigne; Nor ever were beyond Our owne Coasts yet. Neand. Nor do we understand What your Synedrium is, unlesse it be Your Mayor and Senate of Bizantium. Who, as we heare, once in an age runne madde; And then talke Idly, of nought but Liberty; Changing of Government; The fatall periods Of States and Kingdomes; How They vote twice two Thirty: Or their owne Scarlet's gray; Or Thracians, Scythians; Or that They not rebell against your King, When in a popular fury They cast off The yoke of Subjects, for any aide They e're Received from us. Theag. Well, since y'have cleared your selves Of that great Doubt; Resolve us then, what makes The Queene of Amazons among you? Call: What made Her Grandmother in Alexanders Army? She comes to show Her selfe her Neece, To fight, And to have Amazons begot upon her. Neand. Had these not interrupted us, we should By this have knowne whither her Ladies came For the same businesse. Mel. That Sir is presum'd; Subjects are bound to imitate their Princes. Theag: Next, what are your Designes? we heare you mean This Day to give us Battle. Call. For our Designes, Some say you have tame pidgeons, taught to fly With Newes and Letters, betwixt Campe and Campe; Whereby our Counsels are no sooner hatcht, But They take Wing to you. Neand. Others affirme, You have your Multiplying Instruments, Which take our Truthes at one end, and, like Glasses, Show Them in various shapes to th'people; And Returne your Monsters to us at the Other, In shapes more various and prodigious, To fright us, as the Barbarous did of old, With Elephants, and Castles in the Aire; And such like Expeditions; which once knowne, Looke bigge, and are despised. Art. Then for the battle, This is the Day for our New Legions To be brought in; which when They come; Our King Intends to stake his Kingdome 'gainst your Princesse: The Conquerour take both. Mel. This is a playnesse, Which does show generous in you. Lastly, therefore As you'l avoide the Tortures of the Wheele, Or Racke, in Questions of this moment; Tell us, What Officers have you that may be bought, To let us have good penny-worths, if we Should have occasion to joine Art to Armes, And chaffer for a Castle, Fort, or Towne, Or a Defeate, or so? How's your Prince guarded? Call. As a Prince should be, by Gentlemen; whose Lives Are cheaper to them then their Honours; And More cheaply to be purchast from Them. Men Who'd looke on Tempters, as New Enemies; And think't New Justice added to their Cause, To fight 'gainst those who would corrupt 'em, Breifly, Th'are Men who doe propose onely these two Brave Ends unto Themselves, to dye, and to Be Loyall to their Prince; About whose person Their Valours make one Guard, their Loves another. Art. Some under Officers perhaps there may be, Whose Trade &amp; Occupation 'tis to Kill, And to grow rich by Slaughters; Vile Market Spirits, Who doe not fight for Fame, or Cause, but thinke That side is most ith' Right which gives most pay. And these Warres justest where there is most plunder: Whom you may buy o're to your side, and we Upon a New Sale, may buy backe againe. You I beleive have some in your Campe too, Who are like Victory; Hover a while With doubtfull Wings betweene both Armies, and At last forsake the weakest. Theag: Since y'have made A free Confession, wee'l now proceed unto As free a Centure of you. My Lords, pronounce Each in your order. Orith. My sentence is, that since They were caught in a Ladies Tent, at Houres When all good Souldiers should be on their Watches; And since They were surprized, and no swords drawne: (Which renders them uncapable of a More Manly punishment) They be attir'd In Womens Clothes, and so led through the Campe In triumph, then left to their Ransomes. Thal. I Concurre with you; But doe adde farther, that Instead of Ransome, in that Dresse. They be Returned to be Another show of scorne To their owne Army. Theag. What say you two? Men. We Doe both agree in one breife Vote; which is, That since we heare they boast of Ladies favours, To which a gratefull speechlessnesse is due, That first They have their Tongues cut out, and so Made Mutes; Next, that they be gelt, and made Eunuches; And thus disabled from all what concernes The Company of Women, but to keepe 'em; That thy be sold to th'Persian; who'l imploy 'em With these Capacities in their Seraglio's. Serp. You see we told you true. Call. Pray, pray my Lords, Reverse this cruell sentence. Rather let us Be drest like Women, then be made no Men. Neand. Rather cut off our Heads, then Tongues; and make us Mutes that way. Mel. To which of us doe you speake? Neand: To the Lords with the treble voyces. Mel. Well, Though we might shew our rights of Conquest on you, And yet proceed to harder Doomes; since victours Cannot be cruell, where the worst is lawfull; Yet if you'l sweare never hereafter to Beare Armes against us, with your eyes we will Restore you to your Liberty. Art: Let's sweare; 'Twilbe a fine excuse to keepe's from fighting. Call: We sweare. Mel: By our Gods or your own? Call: By all Our Country Gods we'l neare beare armes against you. Mel: You take the same oath? Nean: Yes. Art: If you'l have me I'le sweare by all your Gods too, you shall never Take me in armes against you. The. Perhaps you will They unbind 'em. Out run your followers. Now unbinde 'em; next They unblinde 'em. Give 'em their sight. Orith. Ha, ha, ha, Looke how meekely, And peaceably they looke? Thal: what a Tranquillity, And harmelesse Calme is in their Countenances? Men. How undisturb'd they beate this? How serenely? As if they were at Truce with all the world. Mar. who would not be a Coward, to be endu'd with such a guift of Patience? Theag: Gentlemen, Having so amply testified your valors To us, and these faire Ladies, We'l report Your Chievalry to th'King. Meane time we leave you To you stout Resolutions, and Chronicle, To be set forth in Epicke Meeter on you. Mel: Farewell brave Champions; Take heed your examples Do not infect your Companions. Orith: Pray, when You have spare houres, and are returnd unto Your Courages, let us once more partake Of your defences at our Tent. Thal: And as You finde us free, and yeilding, pray for our Sakes, and your own, conceale your Entertainment. Exeunt. Men. Pray keep your selves whole men. Mar: And safe from dangers Mac: Captaines we have our pay a month before hand. We'l take leave too, and returne to our postures. Call: Pray stay, pray stay; Is not your name Macrinus? Mac: Yes Sir. Nean: Yours Lacero I take it? Lac: True Sir. Call. And you are Lantspesado Serpix? Serp. Sir, I should deny my selfe else. Neand. And 'tis thought There are your Breeches? Lac. We confesse it; And These yours, and Doublets. Mac: Troth we know you scorne To weare 'em after us; or to put on Clothes which you once cast off. Serp. Adiew sweet Captaine; We will report your Bounty to the Campe. Lacer. And show how you have guilded us, and made us Three Compleate Gentlemen of your Companies. Exeunt. SCÃNA III. Callias, Neander, Artops. Call. Neander? Neand. Hum. Call. Was this a Dream, &amp; did All these appeare to us in our sleepe? or wast A reall vision? Neand. Why doe you aske? Call. Because, if it were reall, I expect That passages so fit for History, Shall not scape Mercuries or Scout Gazetes; But shortly be recorded with the Deedes Of Democraticke John, or the Red nos'd Burgesse, Who enacts Ordinances in Sacke; Or with The Life and Death of preaching Nol, and Rowland. Neand. If we scape rascall poetry I care not. All my feare is, lest He who carved the Embleme Of the Oxe with foure Hornes, spitting fire, like one Oth' Bulls which Jason conquer'd, should cut us With Wings, in most vile libell figure, flying, Like Owles by Twilight, and moultring these our feathers, Before two she Kites, following us with Quivers. Call: True; And then Pistoclerus, who lives by His yearely Gifts in scraping verse, and pictures, T'expound this to the Multitude in Ballad, Sung to the direfull Tune of Orpheus torne By Oyster Wives. Neand. Artops, Suppose this should Arrive to th'Knowledge of your browne Lycoris. Ith' Suburbs? Art: Pray don't trouble me, I'me in A serious Contemplation. Neand. What is't? Art. Why. If you'l needs know, 'Tis whither it be not fit (To prove our selves no Cowards, and to show How much we can slight Death in any shape) That we should call our Regiments together; Erect a handsome Traverse; Then desire The Company They'd joine with us in one Of Homers Odes, and after a short Confession, Turne our selves off in Packthread. Call: Come, we must Doe something to redeeme our Credits: The Boyes Will else tye Squibbes behinde us, as we passe, And make us walke the Streetes in Fireworkes. Exeunt. SCÃNA. IV. Eurymedon, Roxane, Barsene. Eurym. Madam, you put too great names on my Visits, To stile them meritorious Dangers. 'Tis So little I have done, thus to adventure To your faire presence, secur'd onely by The weake vaile and cloud which I weare about me, That this but rankes me yet 'mongst vulgar Lovers; Who would doe much more for one fading Kisse, Which dies in the fruition, and perishes Whilest 'tis received, from her they love. Bars. But Sir, So often to descend from your great Selfe, Where once had beene enough to gaine a Princesse; And to submit your selfe to this darke shade, Which might betray you, and at best conceales you But as Eclipses doe conceale the Sun; Which when They hide, doe robbe him too, and take His bright rayes from him; And all this to enjoy The fraile Sight of a Woman, who returnes You nought but Taske for Visit, and whose presence Might it securely be possest, and you Not venture a Captivity as often As you passe to and fro, at most can make But this poore, short requitall, To be seene Such as She is, one onely rich in promises, Where She wants Treasures more Substantiall; And those performed so much below the Receiver, So apt to breed Repentance, as to deserve Onely to passe 'mongst the Injuries of Love, Is such a Noblenesse, which first esteemes And values Meane Things, whose Worth is Opinion, And then findes Arguments to prize them, and T'account them amiable: y'have added This To my Releasement when I was your prisoner, Still to proceed in the same generous errour; Still to beleive me worthy to be loved, As then to be surprized, and to be told so. Eurym. You are the first, Most Gracious Barsene, Who robbed her selfe to make Another rich; Or stript her selfe of her owne praises to Adorne Anothers Wants, and then looke on him As a Thing Worthy to be valued. The Gods When They returne a large and plenteous vintage For a few Drops of Wine pour'd on their Altars: Or doe repay a Graine or Two consumed In Sacrifice, with a whole feild of Incense; Or when They doe require a pilgrimage Made to their Shrines, with Answers which doe promise More then the Supplicant or askes, or hopes for, Are not more Bounteous, more free and liberall, Then you; who thus doe glorifie what You In Justice might despise; And call your owne Perfections, which attract me to your presence, Desert in me; Or thinke I merit, when You make me happy. Nor can I count my visits Among my Dangers, which are so much sweetned By your Allowance of Them. If they be Dangers, 'Tis a felicity I covet to Be allways neare my Thraldome. To be taken Coming or Going, and held Captive, Will Be such a suffering as will endeare it selfe; And be one of my pleasures, when I thinke For whose sake I'me a Bondman. Bar: But, Great Sir, What can you see in me, besides a Minde Willing to understand it selfe beloved And to returne Affection for Affection. Which should expose you to these perils; And Make't an Adventure every time you see me; And your returne backe an Escape? Eur: I see A forme more beautifull, more attracting, then All those for which the King of Gods left Heaven. And which t'enjoy, he rather chose to be Transformed into a Flame, or spangled showre, Then to remaine the Thunderer; And thought it A happier shape to be a Swanne, then to Be clothed with his owne Lightning. Should you set me The taskes of Hercules, or bid me turne Fable into story, and make his Labours mine; Or should enjoyne me fights where th'enemy Growes numerous from my Conquests. And multiplies From every wound I give him; And having finisht One Labour, should you straight prescribe another; And make me so divide my life betweene My Love and Conflicts; Such a reward as you, Would be a greater recompence, then to Be placed among the Starres, and there to shine A Constellation, wreath'd about with my Owne Victories; and glittering with the spoiles I tooke from Lyons. Rox: Well, Sir, Barsene hath Receiv'd so true, so full a Testimony Both of your Love, and fortitude, that now Nothing is wanting to put both you and us In full possession of our wishes, but The opportunity to reveale our selves After the noblest manner. Bar: Your Taske is onely To set your Army in Array, to joine Battle with ours, that, from this shew of Warre, We may at our Returne unto our selves, The better raise a peace: And make an Olive Spring from our Mirtles. Meane time I am your Conquest. Eur. And I, who came a Prince, returne your Captive. Exeunt. SCÃNA V. Archidamus, Lyncestes, Polydamas, Theagines, Meleager. Archid. My Lords, Lyncestes and Polydamas, You Two stoppe all the passages by which The Prince of Thrace is to returne; That done, Put the new forces you have brought in posture. And fit Array, if need be, to suppresse All Campe Commotions. We are not safe 'mongst Women. Lync. It shall be done. Arch. And let th'old Forces be In Readinesse, if th'Adverse Army doe Invite us to joyne Battle; to entertaine it, And meet them in the Feild. Polyd. It shall be Order'd. Arch. But is it credible Eurymedon Should have the Confidence to trust Himselfe To a thinne weake Disguise, and in a Cloud So open and transparent, should passe through My Campe, on such a treacherous Enterprize? Theag. He's now Sit at the Queenes Tent, where they hold A secret Consultation. Mel. We saw him enter Just at the Instant when two of her Ladies, The One Lieutenant Generall of the Army, The Other Lady Marshall of the Feild, Were telling us the plot. Arch. That 'tis concluded, Roxane shall be carried backe to Thrace, Barsene be restored (perhaps deflour'd) And He to choose Hyppolyta, or her Sister, Instead of Mine to be his Queene? Theag. Yes, Sir, They are indifferent, and are resolved. Since you refused 'em, to wedde by Lottery. Of which refusall they are so sensible, That when both armies joine, 'tis too contriv'd, (Which I do wonder they should, yet discover) The Amazons, upon the signe given, shall Turne to the other side; And sacrifice Your overthrow to their Revenge; Or what's More to be feared, your Kingdome to their Nuptialls. Mel: Antiope, the sister, wants a portion; And if she bring your Crowne, and Scepter with her; Or, if t'enlarge her Husbands Territories, She adde yours to 'em, the Match will be more Princely, And she appeare so much the more her selfe, Sir, If she can raise a Dowry from your Conquest. Arch: Oh the deceitfullnesse of Women! whose Affection's like the Rainbow, can shew painted, And Court us with a thousand Beauteous Colours, Yet all this onely serve to guild a Storme: And make a Tempest looke more flattering. We must use Plot 'gainst Plot. To seize upon The Ladies were dishonourable; And To take these Captive who are now our Guests, (Though they deserve it, having forfeited The Stile of Friends they brought, for Enemies) Would be our blot in History. You two, therefore, Seize on the Prince at his returne, His Ransome Shall be the Restitution of our Ladies. A Battle beaten within, Enter Macrinus. Hark, what means this? Macr. Arme, arme your selves; Both Campes Are joined; And th'Amazons have put themselves In Armes against us, 'Tis rumor'd through the Field, To charge us in the Reare, The Thracians In Front: and so t'encircle us in a Parenthesis of Enemies, compos'd Of Men before us, and Women, Sir, Behinde. Arch: We'l to the field straight. O false Sex! The Winde May be made constant, but not Womankinde. Exeunt. SCÃNA VI. After a Battle beaten within, enter at one doore, in fighting postures, Archidamus, Theagines, Meleager. At the other Eurymedon, Clytus, Hippocles. Arch. I'me glad I have met you out of Cloudes, in your Owne shape, and like your selfe. Y'have hitherto Obscur'd your selfe, in Mistes, of your owne raising To play the Theese in, since you landed false Prince! Was't not enough you did pursue my Queene With your unnecessary expedition; And when our Nuptiall Torch was placed, and kindled Upon the Altar, must then quench it, And Like those who do robbe Temples (For to take her Thus from me was plaine Sacriledge) must snatch her Then backe againe, just when the sacred Cake Was breaking 'twixt the Flamens hands, And all The Gods of Weddings in their Saffron Robes, But as part of your pyracy, and stealth, (If yet the treacherous surprize of a Weake Company of Ladies do deserve A name not yet more Infamous) must joine My sister, and the beauteous part of my Whole Court, and Kingdome in the Rape? As if You meant t'erect a new Seraglio, or T'enlarge your old: And take them prisoners first, Then use them 'mongst your other prostitutes? Eurym: Is this all? Arch: There is one thing more. To shew Your power upon that Sex, (which you, I see, Have striv'd by all wayes to make yours, And, where By force you could not, have conquer'd by Petition) Was't not enough you did begin the Warre In the surprize of Ladies, but that since You must continue it by Stratagem, More treacherous then the first? And in your false And borrowed shapes, (In which you nightly have Appeared to the Queene of Amazons) must tempt Her, and her Ladies from their pure Affections, Which made them first resolve, wonne by the Justice, And Goodnesse of my Cause, to fight for me, Untill seduc'd they grew Conspiratours, And did resolve to fight for you? Had you First taken, and then match't Barsene, yet, To be your Queene, thus, had not beene a Wedding, But a Captivity; And to be forc'd Unto your bed with shackles on, is not To be your Princesse, but your slave, But first To take her prisoner, And, (For ought I know) To use your power of Conquest on her, And To make her first unworthy of your Nuptials,) And then despise her, for one more entire, More free, and more untoucht, (For your new Loves Made to Hippolyta, and her sister Prince, Have not beene so disguis', like you the Lover, As to escape my knowledge) is such a wrong. (Besides my other Interest of having My Queene kept from me) as I stand here to punish; Or else to adde my fall unto my sufferings. Eurym: Have you, Sir, finisht your Oration? Arch: This Onely remaines. To save th'expence of blood, Which may be shed on both sides, since the Quarrell Is purely ours, Let's not engage our Armies But here conclude the warre, The injur'd with The Injurer, in one faire, single Combate. Theag: Sir, we've a Cause going too; And have two Ladies. Who well might thinke us two Indifferent Cowards, And very cold in their Revenge, should we Stand peaceable Spectatours, whilest you fight. Mel: We do beseech you, Sir, Let us joine our Poore Interest with yours; And since the number, And quality of the Combatants is equall, T'expresse the like sense of our wrongs, let it Be Three to Three. Clyt: We do accept the challenge; And will maintaine, your Ladies are our Prisoners, More Nobly then they were at first your Wives; And that we tooke them farre more honourably Then you first married 'em. Eurym: Pray stay a little. To shew Archidamus, (For I will not, Although I justly might, call your false Prince, Being guilty of those Accusations, which You sticke on me) that we bring equall causes, As well as equall Valours, to defend them, Since you observ'd a Method in your Wrongs, And those suspicions onely, and imaginary, I'le use one in my Answers? 'Tis confest I did use Art to gaine by plot what was By plot taken from me, Roxane, my best sister. And if in her surprize I did recover But what you first stole, and redeem'd my Losse With some inforcement, this deserves the name Of a Retrive not of a Pyracy. Next that I tooke your Sister with my owne, 'Twas part of my Affection to her; Love Prompted me to the Action; which doth not Cease to be Love, because it once put on The shape of Force; And that force but made use of, To let her know that he who tooke her was The greater prisoner, and was first surpriz'd. How I have us'd her since, the Gods, and she, Her owne Historian, when you see her next Will witnesse for me. Lastly, If refus'd By you, (I will not say by her, for her Consent takes flame from yours) I've beene a Suitor, Where I've beene freely heard, and entertained, Ask't and prevail'd, For you to claime a Soveraignty, Over th'Affections of Hippolyta. Or her faire Sister, or call me Theefe, or treacherous, Because I've added nights to my disguises, That my Accesses to them might be more Secure, More undisturb'd, is such a Wrong To me and them; That in their Absence, I Stand here to make good with my sword, my stealths, Have beene more noble then your open Visits. And that I am more Constant to Barsene In the new purchase of their Loves, Then you Are to Roxane in refusing them. Now, Sir, I am prepar'd to meet your stroakes. Clyt: Your Challenge holds too? Theag: Yes; you shall perceive, You fight not now with Women. Hipp: We see y'are Men, And you shall finde us such. Mel: 'Tis nobly promis'd. SCÃNA. VII. As they prepare to fight enter to them, Their faces undiscolour'd, and to be knowne, Roxane, who takes hold of Archidamus, Barsene of Eurymedon. Rox: Hold as y'are Princes; And respect the Cries, Of your owne Ladies, who in your wounds bleed. And, if you fall must here expire with you; Since neither of you can fall singly, and We not be slaine too. Bar: Great Archidamus,â My royall Lord Eurymedon,â(For now I dare professe you) what meane you to contract, And thus remove the Warre into a Duell? O sheath your swords; See your Barsene begs. Rox: Once more heare your Roxane, Sir; And here Cast downe your weapon. Or if we be the cause Of this your strife, be reconcil'd by turning Your swords on us. See here two Sacrifices Ready to buy your peace with their owne slaughters. Arch: How's this? Roxane and Barsene? Sure My eyes are not themselves; Or else my Joyes Make me take Visions for Realities. Theag: Beleeve us, Sir, These are no 'empty shades Which will appeare and vanish. Mel: These have bodies, Compos'd of Flesh and Bloud. Eur: Now, Sir, you see, If you'l proceed ith' Combate, I want not A noble cause to fight for. If you'l now Call my surprize of these a pyracy, Or my stolne visits since made to their Tents A Treason, in which these went Conspiratours, I hope you'l think't a Treason, in which I Had onely this one honourable aime, To render my selfe worthy to be owned by this faire Princesse; and to betray you to A league and freindship with me by th'Exchange Of Queenes and Sisters. Arch: Is this true? Rox: Our plot Was in thse borrowed shapes onely to try How you would beare our Losse; Or whither we Might tempt you from your Constancy. Which, Sir, Hath beene so firme, so settled, four shaken, So much beyond her Merits who made tryall, That I'me now twice yours; And the second time Takes her in his Armes. Here cast my self into your armes. Arc. Y'are here, Once more my bright starre fixt in your owne sphÃ¦re. Bar: Then, for you, Great Eurymedon, To leave Your Kingdome for the sight, and spectacle Of one, whose Beauty can at most aspire But to be seene, and pardon'd; After that, To turne that which at first shew'd boisterous force, Into a generous Courtship; And to change That which I first tooke for a rude surprize, Into the noblest way of Love; And there To be a Suplicant, and to spend sighes, Prayers, and Petitions, where you might command Affection as your Conquest, Addes so pure, So cleare, so bright a Luster to your flame, And calls forth such a just, and vertuous heate From me, to meet with yours, that from the time You did release, I became your Captive; And you gain'd this by setting of me free, Onely to change one Thraldome for another; And from that time to make me weare your Fetters, And to be wholly yours. Eur: If these be Fetters, I shall for ever wish to be your prison; Takes her in his Armes. And thus to hold you chain'd. I hope, Sir, you Will not unlinke us now. Arch. Such a Seperation Were such a sinne, as would be punisht with The Anger of the Gods; And would deserve To have another added to it; And I Be once more in the number of the Divorc'd. To make the knot more firme, here, Sir, Insigne Y'have had two conquests of me, I lay downe My selfe, and Weapon at your feet. Eur. And I First Conquer'd by your Sister, next, your selfe, Make this confession of it. Theag: My Lords They lay downe their Swords You see the Warres are ended; If't please you Let us put up our swords. Clyt: We'l shew the way, Sir. Arch: Next since there's nothing wanting to Combine us, In one strickt Union, but the Priest, and Temple, Please you, we will to th'Altar, and there first. Conclude a lasting peace, And then our Nuptials. Exeunt. Eurym: Lead on; I follow you. Theag: I mar'le, my Lord, Our Amazons appeare not, with their Brace Of Posset-makers. Mel: They are but shifting faces; Enter Orith. Thal. That they may laugh at us in their owne shapes. See where they come. Thea: How's this? How's this? I'le pawn My life another ComÅdy; Let's stand, And over-heare 'em. Mel: Looke how they shew in Helmets. SCÃNA. VIII. Enter Callias, Neander, Artops. Leading Orithya, Thalastris, Menalippe and Marthesia; with Helmets on, plumed as taken prisoners by them. Call: Come, come along, Nay you shall know, most stout, Most sterne Bellona's, what 'tis to be Traitours Against a State, Was this your errand? This Your faire pretence of having Children by us. To betray those that should beget em? Now We know how you or'ecome the Scythians; You did invite them to your Tents, And there Conquer'd the Men by night, by day their Country. Neand. What could you see in us to thinke us of A feebler Fabricke, or not so well built, Nor of such tough Chines as the Thracians, that You should so itch to sell us to 'em, for Nights Lodgings, And the transitory pleasure Of keeping of you waking? Orith: To the wrong You offer to our Innocence, and Honours, Y'are scurrilous and that is one wrong more Offer'd to our chaste eares. Your mouthes need washing; Or rather gelding. We project to betray you? Art: Why, I beseech you, Lady Telamon, If I should aske you, And this Lady Ajax, Together with your two Sarpedons here, Was't not contriv'd you in our absence should Seize on our Magazine? Then crested thus In your bright Helmets, (To which nothing lackes But a sheild with a Gorgons Head, to turne Vs into a stone, and Conquer us with ill lookes,) That you should sally forth upon us; And Then joine, almost had said couple, with The Enemy? You will deny this? Thal: Yes, And having had experience of your Valours, Dare here maintaine the contrary with our swords, Two Women 'gainst three Men, without our seconds, We seize upon your Magazine? Call: so you'l Deny you did receive us at your Tabernacle, Your amorous pavilion; And that these two Sweet Cymball-beaters, otherwise call'd Drummers, Did strike a false Alarme? Neand: Or that you hir'd Three Meager-halfe-pin'd-Rascals, having first Depriv'd us of our eyes, To lead us thrice Round 'bout the Workes, to lengthen out our progresse Towards the Enemies Campe; And there to be Arraign'd before a Councell, which consisted Of two she Collonels, two she Clerks of Your Comfits, and Suckets; two young Lords; who no doubt Enjoyed all that we came for. Orith: 'Tis confest, Sir. Had you enjoyed us, our Children onely had Beene valiant by the Mothers side. Art: We'l have Our Councell too; where we expect you shall Confesse your Treason too, Against the King. March on before there. Theag: Pray stay Gentlemen; Where do you lead these Ladies, thus three deepe In File, without a Drumme? You are not going To teach 'em postures, are you? Or make a Muster Of foure commanded by three? Mel: If you meane To lead 'em 'gainst the Enemy, to show Your Fortitudes before 'em, once more; surely The Warres are ended. Call: Sir, we are leading 'em To th'King; we have discover'd a foule Treason. Theag: How? Neand: Yes, Sir, such a Treason, and these the plotters As does shew Women make but th'other Twinne With Mischeife; And that Falsehood, when it would Betray men, still assumes their shape. Art: These Sir, Who can lodge Serpents 'mongst their Roses, and Smile o're their Treacheries, But that we did Timely prevent 'em, would have put the Campe Into a Muteny. We did take these Two Lady-Rhetoricks mounting heapes of Turfe, Provided to make speeches to the Souldiers; T'inflame them to Rebellion. Mel: 'Tis not possible. Neand: Yes, Sir, And these two Yeomen of the Gally pots. Were imploy'd, as we heare, to offer the Free use both of Themselves, and Ladies, to All those who with them would forsake our side, And turne to th'Thracians. Orith: Wee will endure't no longer. These iron Veyles cast off, thus we confute you. They take off their helmets Call: How's this? Orithya and Thalastris? with Their Women Menalippe and Marthesia? Art: Amazon-fighters turn'd to our owne Court peace-wormes. And my two Troilus's transfor'd to Knitsters? Theag: They are our Wives. Was ever such a plot Laid by two Women to keepe their Husbands honest? Mel: They've turn'd what I thought Fornication Into the acts of Wedlocke. How I love Such projects, where men are betray'd unto Their lawfull pleasure, and tempted to commit Adultery with Innocence, and no sinne follow? Thal: Pray view us well; And now our paintings off, (As you once pleasantly did stile us) pray, Officious Gentlemen; what other plot Can you discerne in us, but to laugh at you? Neand: This comes of policy; Our wisdomes have Made us three sage, discreet, deepe, most rare Coxcombes. Men: Ha, ha, ha; Sure they did expect the King Should Knight 'em for their rare Discovery. Mar: Or Preferre 'em to the Councell Board, and make 'em Spies Generall of the State. Orith: Troth, Gentlemen, If you intend to scape Playes, and at your Returne home to Chalcedon, not to see Your Deeds brought on the Stage, take our advice; Travell 'till this be over. Thal: And be sure, You keepe your selves from Duels; Least your Country. Do suffer in your Valours. Theag: You see there is No medling with these Women; I'le undertake, They can change shapes, as often as shift Linen. The Booke of Transformations, which reports Of Women turn'd to Baytrees, and of Men Turn'd into Women, hath not more various formes, Then these can practice. Mel: Alas 'tis not your case To be deceived. They did deceive us too. Orith: We have two constant Lords of you. So't had been Had we been Amazons in earnest. Theag. you are The Two first Ladies that ere made their Husbands Cuckold themselves with their owne Wives. Thal. By this Goodlight 'twould be but justice now to put A Courtotricke on you. Mel. Alas ThalÃ¦stris; I Discern'd you by your brests. Th. Be sure you lay Enter Arch. Eurym. &amp;c. With your own Wife. Mel. Look, Gentlemen, D'you know these Shapes? Here comes the second part Oth' Metamorphosis. SCÃNA IX. Enter two Priests carrying two hallowed Torches Followed by Archidamus leading Roxane, and Eurymedon leading Barsene waited on by Clytus and Hippocles. Arch: âThus having made Our Realmes one people, by the League and Knot We've tyed before the Gods, you two proceed In the last Rites of this our Union, And sing the Nuptiall Song. The second Song, sung by two Priests, holding two marriage Tapers. (1) Behold these hallowed Tapers; And here see, What Wells, and Springs of fire they be. How their two Lusters twining Make mutuall shining. Whil'st one from th'other kindled, doth requite I's borrowed, with as great a Light for Light, And kindles backe againe. And thus combining Rayes with Rayes, And joining flames, like Marriage Dayes, A holy Nuptiall 'twixt them do maintaine. (2) Yet these but the darke signes, and emblems be Of those conceal'd fires, which none see But Gods, and such whose eyes Love Glorifies, Betweene these brests a sacred flame doth spring, Which intermingling Rites, whilst we do sing, Is to it selfe the Priest. Whilst Heart with Heart, thus intermoved, And paires made one, The Lov'd with Loved, Themselves between themselves in Hymens twist, The Song is seconded with a shout within. âHarke, harke, what is The meaning of this shout and Acclamation? Enter Lync: Polyd: Lync: Sir, the two Armies hearing that their Princes Have strucke a Peace, have first exchanged their Armes, And next, in Imitation of your Nuptialls, Which with this shout they celebrate, have cast Themselves into new postures of Imbraces. Polyd: Did you behold 'em, you'd beleeve there past A mutuall wedding betweene Troope and Troope, And Regiment and Regiment. They want Onely one of your Priests here to performe The holy Ceremony betweene 'em, To Make it a perfect Day of HymenÃ¦als. Arch: And so't shall be. Nought now remaines, but that We do adde Triumphs to our Joyes, and mingle, Our Feasts, and Daunces with our Sacrifices, In thankfulnesse to th'Gods. Then Princes doe Match truely, when their Kingdomes marry too. FINIS.</field>
