      <field name="fulltext">The First Act. Enter Tryer and Lacy. Tryer, And how and how? Lacy, The cause depends. Tr. No Mistresse. La. Yes, but no Wife. Tr. For now she is a Widdow. La. But I resolveâ Tr. What does shee say to thee. La. Shee sayes, I know not what she sayes, but I must take another course, and yet she isâ Tr. A creature of much sweetenesse, if all tongues Be just in her report, and yet tis strange Having seven yeares expected, and so much Remonstrance of her Husbands losse at Sea, She should continue thus. La. What if she should Renew the bond of her devotion For seven yeares more. Tr. You will have time enough, To pay in your affection. La. Ide make, A voyage to Cassandra's Temple first, And marry a deform'd Maide, yet I must Confesse she gives me a faire respect. Tr. Has she, A hope her Husband may be living yet? I cannot tell; she may have a conceipt, Some Dolphin has preserv'd him in the storme, Or that he may be tenant to some Whale; Within whose belly he may practise lent, And feed on fish, till hee be vomited Vpon some coast, or having scap'd the seas, And billes of Exchange fayling, he might purpose To foote it ore the Alpes in his returne, And by mischance is fallen among the mise, With whom perhappes he battens upon sleepe, Beneath the Snow. Tr. This were a Vagary. La. I know not what to thinke, or is she not the worse for the coy Lady that lives with her. Tr. Her Kinswoman? La. Such a malicious peece, (I meane to love) tis pittie any place But a cold Nunnery should be troubled with her; If all maides were but her disciples, wee Should have no generation, and the world For want of Children in few yeares undone by't: Here's one can tell you more, is not that Iarvis The Widdowes servant. Enter Venture and Servant. Ven. Whether in such haft man? Ser. I am commanded Sir to fetch a Gentleman. Ven. To thy Mistresse? To give her a heate this morning. Ser. I ha spied him; with your pardonâ the servant goes to Lacy Tr. Good morrow Maister Venture. Ven. Franke Tryer. Tr. You looke iocond and high, Venus has bin propitious, I dreamt last night thou wert a Bridegrome. Ven. Such a thing may be, the winde blowes now From a more happie coast, La. I must leave you, I am sent for, Tr. To thy Mistresse? La. Without more ceremony, gentlemen my serviceâfarwell. Exit. Ven. Ile tell thee, I have a Mistresse. Tr. I beleeve it Ven. And yet I have her not. Tr. But you have hope. Ven. Or rather certainty. Tr. Why, I heare she is A very Tyrant over men. Ven. Worse, worse, The needle of a Diall never had So many waverings, but she is touch'd, And she Points onely this way now, true North; I am her Pole. Tr. And she your Vrsa minor, Ven. I laugh to thinke how other of her Rivals Will looke when I enioy her. Tr. Yare not yet contracted? Ven. No she chang'd Some amorous tokens, do you see this Diamond? A toy she gave me. Tr. Cause she saw you a Sparke. Ven. Her flame of love is here, and in exchange She tooke a chaine of Pearle. Tr. Youle see it hang'd. Ven. These to the wise are arguments of love, And mutuall Promises. Enter Lord Bonvile and Page. Tr. Your Lordship's welcome to Towne, I am blest to see your honour in good health. Lo. Prethee visit my Lodgings. Tr. I shall presume to tender my humble service. Ven. What's he? Exit Lord and Page. Tr. A sprigge of the Nobilitie, That has a spirit equall to his fortunes, A gentleman that loves cleane Napery. Ven. I guesse your meaning. Tr. A Lady of pleasure, tis no shame for Men Of his high birth to love a Wench his honour May priviledge more sinnes, next to a Woman He loves a running horse, setting a side these recreations, He has a Noble Nature, valiant, bountifull. Ven. I was of his humour till I fell in love, I meane for wenching, you may guesse a little, By my legges, but Ile now be very honest, And when I am marriedâ Tr. Then you are confident To carry away your Mistresse from em all. Ven. From Ioue himselfe, thought he should practise all His shapes to court her, tis impossible She should put any trick upon me, I Have wonne her very soule. Tr. Her body must Needes be your owne then. Ven. I have a brace of Rivals Would they were here that I might Ieere em, And see how opportunely one is come, Enter Master Rider. Ile make you a little sport. Tr. I ha bin Melancholy, You will, expresse a favour in't. Rid. M. Venture, The first man in my wish, What gentleman is that? Ven. A Friend of mine. Rid. I am his servant, looke yee, we are friends An't shall appeare, how ever things succeed That I have lov'd you, and you cannot take My Councell in ill part. Ven. Whats the businesse? Rid. For my part, I have Vs'd no inchantment, philter, no devices That are unlawfull, to direct the streame Of her affection, it flowes naturally. Ven. How's this? prethee observe. Tr. I do and shall laugh presently. Rid. For your anger I weare a sword, though I have no desire It should be guilty of defacing any Part of your body, yet upon a just And noble provocation, wherein My Mistresse love, and honour is engaged, I dare draw blood. Tr. Ha, ha, ha! Ven. A Mistresse love and honour? this is pretty. Rid. I know you cannot But understand me, yet I say I love you, And with a generous breast, and in the confidence You will take it kindely, I returne to that I promis'd you, good councell, come leave off The prosecution. Ven. Of what I prethee? Rid. There wilbe lesse affront then to expect Till the last minute, and behold the victory Anothers, you may guesse, why I declare this? I am studious to preserve an honest friendshippe. For though it be my glory, to be adorn'd With trophies of her vanquisht love. Ven. Whose love? Tr. This sounds as if he Ieer'd you Ven. Mushroompe! Tr. What dee meane gentlemen? friends and fall out About good Councell. Ven. Ile put up a gaine Now I thinke better on't: Tr. Tis done discreetly, Cover the nakednesse of your toole I pray. Ven. Why looke you Sir. If you bestow this Councell Out of your love, I thanke you; yet there is No great necessitie, why you should be at The cost of so much breath, thing's well considered. A Ladies love is mortall, I know that, And if a thousand men should love a woman The dice must carry her, but one of all Can weare the Garland. Tr. Now you come to him. Ven. For my owne part, I lov'd the Lady wel, But you must pardon me, if I demonstrate There's no such thing as you pretend, and therefore In quittance of your loving, honest Councell, I would not have you build an ayry Castle, Her Starres have pointed her another way, This instrument will take her height. Shewes the Ring. Rid. Ha. Ven. And you may guesse what cause you have to triumph, I would not tell you this, but that I love you, And hope you will not runne your selfe into The cure of Bedlam, hee that weares this favour Hath sence to apprehend. Rid. That Diamond. Ven. Observe it perfectly, there are no trophies Of vanquisht love, I take it, comming toward you, It will be lesse affront, then to expect Till the last minute, and behold the victory Anothers. Rid. That Ring I gave her. Tr. Ha, ha, ha! Ven. This was his gift to her, ha, ha, ha! Have patience spleene, ha, ha! Tr. The scene is chang'd! Rid. She wonot use me thus, she did receive it With all the circumstance of love. Ven. I pitty him, my eyes runne ore, dost heare, I cannot choose but laugh, and yet I pitty thee. She has a Ieering wit, and I shall love her More heartily for this. What dost thinke? Poore Gentleman how he has foold himselfe. Rid. Ile to her againe. Ven. Nay, be not passionate! A faith thou wert too confident, I knew It could not hold, dost thinke Ide say so much else? I can tell thee more, but lose her memorie. Rid. Were it more rich hee shewes a Chaine of Pearle. Then that which Cleopatra gave to Anthony, With scorne I would returne it. Tr. She give you this Chaine? Rid. She shall be hang'd in chaines, ere I will keepe it. Ven. Stay, stay, let my eye Examine thatâthis Chaineâ Rid. Who would trust woman after this? Ven. The very same She tooke of me, when I receiv'd this Diamond. Rid. Ha ha! you doe but iest, she wonot foole You o'this fashion, looke a little better, one may be like another. Ven. Tis the same. Rid. Ha, ha, I would it were, that we might laugh At one another, by this hand I will Forgive her, prethee tell meâha, ha, ha! Tr. You will carry her From Ioue himselfe, though he should practise all His shapes to court her. Rid. By this Pearle, o Rogue! How I doe love her fort, be not dejected; A Ladies love is mortall, one of all Must weare the Garland, do not foole your selfe Beyond the cure of Bedlam. Tr. She has fitted you With a paire of fooles Coates, as hansomely As any Taylor, that had taken measure. Ven. Give me thy hand. Tr. Nay lay your heads together How to revenge it, and so gentlemen I take my leave. Ven. She has abusd us. Rid. Let vs take his Councell, Wee can be but what we are. Ven. A paire of credulous fooles. Rid. This other fellow Fairefeild has prevail'd. Ven. Which if hee haveâ Rid. What shall we do? Ven. I thinke we were best let him alone. Rid. Dee heare? Weele to her againe, youle Be ruld by me, and tell her what wee thinke on her. Ven. She may come to herselfe, and be asham'd on't. Rid. If she would affect one of us, for my part I am indifferent. Ven. So say I too, but to give us both the canvas Lets walke, and thinke how to behave our selves. Exeunt. Enter Mistresse Bonavent, and Mistris Caroll. Car. What dee meane to do with him? Bon. Thou art To much a Tyrant, the seven yeares are past, That did oblige me to expect my Husband Engag'd to Sea, and though within those limits Frequent intelligence hath reported him Lost, both to me, and his owne life, I have Bin carefull of my vow; and were there hope Yet to embrace him, I would thinke another Seven yeares no penance, but I should thus Be held a cruell woman, in his certaine Losse, to despise the love of all mankinde. And therefore I resolve, upon so large A triall of his Constancy, at last To give him the reward of his respects To me andâ Ca. Marry him. Bo. You have apprehended! Ca. No marvaile if men raile upon you then, And doubt whether a Widdow may be sav'd, We Maides are thought the worse on, for your easines, How are poore women overseene? We must Cast a way our selves upon a whyning lover In charity, I hope my Cousens Ghost Will meete, as you go to Church, or if You scape it then, upon the Wedding nightâ Bo. Fy, Fy. Ca. When you are both a bed and candles out. Bo. Nay put not out the candles. Ca. May they burne blew then, at his second kisse And fright him fromâwell I could say something But take your courseâhe's come already. Enter Lacy. Put him off, but another twelue moneth, so, so, Oh love into what foolish labyrinthes Dost thou leade us! I would all women were But of my minde, we would have a new world Quickly, I will goe studie Poetry, A purpose, to write verses in the praise Of th' Amazonian Ladies, in whom only Appeare true valour (for the instruction Of all posterity) to beate their husbands. La. How you endeare your servant. Ca. I will not Be guilty of more stay. Enter Mr. Fairefeild. Fa. Sweete Lady. Ca. Y'are come in time Sir, to redeeme me. Fa. Why Lady. Ca. You wilbe as comfortable as strong waters, There's a Gentleman. Fa. So uncivill to affront you? Ca. I had no patience to heare him longer; Take his offence before you question him. Fa. And be most happy if by any service You teach me to deserve your faire opinion. Ca. It is not civill to eauesdrop him, but I'me sure he talkes on't now. Fa. Of what? Ca. Of Love, is any thing more ridiculous? You know I never cherish that condition, In you tis the most harsh unpleasing discord, But I hope you will be instructed better Knowing how much my fancy goes against it, Talke not of that and welcome. Fa. You retaine I see your unkind temper, will no thought Soften your heart, disdaine agrees but ill With so much beauty; if you would perswade, Me not to love you, strive to be lesse faire; Vndoe that face, and so become a Rebell, To heaven and Nature. Ca. You doe love my face then! Fa. As heavenly prologue to your minde, I doe not Dote like Pigmalion on the colours! Ca. No you cannot, his was a painted Mistris, Or if it be the minde you so pretend To affect, you encrease my wonder of your folly, For I have told you that so often. Fa. What? Ca. My minde so opposite to all your Courtship, That I had rather heare the tedious tales Of Hollinghead, then any thing that trenches On Love, if you come fraught with any Cupids devises, keepe em for his whirligiggs, Or lande the next edition of his Messenger, Or post with a mad packet, I shall but Laugh at them, and pitty you. La. That pittyâ Ca. Doe not mistake me, it shall be a very Miserable pitty without love! Were I a man, and had but halfe that hansom'nesse, (For though I have not love, I hate detraction,) Ere I would put my invention to the sweate Of Complement, to court my Mistris hand And call her smile blessing beyond a Sunne beame, Entreate to waite upon her, give her Rings With wanton, or most lamentable Poesies, I would turne thrasher. Fa. This is a new doctrine, From women. Ca. 'Twill concerne your peace, to have some faith in't. Fa. You would not be neglected. Ca. You neglect Your selves, the Noblenesse of your birth and nature By servile flattery of this jigging, And that coy Mistresse, keepe your priviledge Your Masculine property. Fa. Is there So great a happinesse in nature! Ca. Theres one just a your minde; can there be such happinesse In nature, fye upont if it were possible, That ever I should be so mad to love, To which I thanke my Starres I am not inclin'd, I should not hold such servants worth my garters, Though they would put me in security To hang themselves, and ease me of their visits. Fr. Y'are a strange gentlewoman! why, looke you Lady? I am not so inchanted with your vertues But I do know my selfe, and at what distance To looke upon such Mistresses, I can be scurvely conditiond, you areâ Ca. As thou dost hope for any good, rayle now But a little. Fa. I could provoke you. Ca. To laugh, but not to lye downe, why! prethee do! Fa. Goe y'are a foolish creature, and not worth My services. Ca. A loud that they may heare The more the merrier, Ile tak't as kindly As if thou hadst given me the Exchange, what all this cloud Without a shower? Fa. Y'are most ingratefull! Ca. Good, abominable peevish, and a wench That would be beaten, beaten blacke and blew. And then perhaps she may have colour for't, Come, come, you cannot scold with confidence Nor with grace, you should looke bigge and sweare You are no gamster, practise Dice And Cardes a little better, you will get Many confusions and fine curses by't. Fa. Is not she mad? Ca. To shew I have my reason Ile give you some good Councell; and be plaine wo'yee None that have eyes, will follow the direction Of a blinde guide, and what dee thing of Cupid? Women are either fooles, or very wise, Take that from me, the foolish women are Not worth your love, and if a woman know How to be wise, she wonot care for you. Fa. Do you give all this Councell without a Fee? Come, be lesse wild! I know you cannot be So hard of soule. Ca. Prethee let my body alone! Fa. Why are you thus peremptory? had Your mother bin so cruell to mankinde, This heresy to love, with you had bin unborne. Ca. My mother was no maide. Fa. How Lady? Ca. She was married long ere I was borne, I take it, Which I shall never be, that rules infallible, I would not have you foold it'h expectation, A favour all my Sutors cannot baost of, Goe home and say your praiers, I wonot looke For thanks till seven yeare hence. Fa. I know not what To say, yes I will home and thinke a Satyre, Was ever man Ieer'd thus for his good will? Exit. Bon. The Licence wilbe soone dispatcht. Lac. Leave that To my care Lady, and let him presume, Whom you intend to blesse with such a gift, Seale on your lips the assurance of his heart, I have more wings then Mercury, expect Your servant in three minutes. Ca. Take more time! Youle over heate your selfe and catch a surfet. La. My nimble Lady I ha busines, wee Will have a Dialogue another time. Exit. Ca. You do intend to marry him then. Bon. I have promised To be his wife, and for his more security This morning. Ca. How? this morning? Bon. What should one That has resolv'd lose time? I do not love Much ceremony, suits in love, should not Like suits in Law, be rack'd from tearme to tearme. Ca. You will joyne issue presently, without your councell, You may be ore throwne; take heed, I have knowne wives That have bin ore throwne in their owne case, and after Non suited too, thats twice to be undone, But take your course, some Widdowes have bin mortifyed. Bon. And Maides do now and then meete with their match. Ca. What is in your Condition makes you weary? Y'are sicke of plenty and command, you have Too too much liberty, too many servants, Your Ieweles are your owne, and you would see How they will shew upon your husbands wagtayle, You have a Coach now, and a Christian Livery To waite on you to Church, and are not Catechise'd When you come home, you have a waiting woman, A Monkey, Squirrell, and a brase of Islands Which may be thought superfluous in your family When husbands come to rule. A pretty Wardrobe A Tayler of your owne, a Doctor too That knowes your body, and can make you sicke It'h spring, or fall, or when you have a minde to't Without controule, you have the benefite Of talking loud and idle at your table May sing a wanton ditty, and not be chidde, Dance and goe late to bed, say your owne prayers, Or goe to Heaven by your Chaplaine. Bo. Very fine. Ca. And will you lose all this? For I Sisley, take thee Iohn, To be my Husband; keepe him still to be your servant, Imitate me, a hundred suiters cannot Be halfe the trouble of one husband. I Dispose my frownes, and favours like a Princesse Deject, advance, undo, create againe It keepes the Subjects in obedience, And teaches em to looke at me with distance. Enter Venture and Rider. Bo. But you encourage some. Ca. Tis when I ha nothing else to do for sport, As for example. Bo. But I am not now in tune to heare em, prethee Lets withdraw. Enter. Ven. Nay, nay, Lady we must follow yee.</field>

Ca. Forboone! proceede! Fa. But you must sweare to performe truely what I shall desire, and that you may not thinke I come with any cunning to deceive you, You shall except what ere you would deny me, And after all Ile make request. Ca. How's this? Fa. But it concernes my life, or what can else Be neerer to me that you sweare. Ca. To what? Fa. When you have made exceptions and thought, What things in all the world you will exempt, From my petition, Ile be confident To tell you my desire. Ca. This is faire play! Fa. I would not for an Empire by a trick Oblige you to performe, what should displease you. Ca.

Suite! if you have another suite tis out of fashion, Ye cannot begge my state, yet I would willingly Give part of that to be rid on thee. Fa. Not one Iewell. Ca. You wo'd not have me spoyle my face, drinke poyson, Or kill any body. Fa. Goodnesse forbid that I should wish your danger. Ca. Then you wo'd not ha me ride through the Citty naked, As once a Princesse of England did through Coventry. Fa. All my desires are modest. Ca. You shall not begge my Parrat nor intreate me To fast, or weare a hayre smocke. Fa. None of these. Ca. I wonot be confin'd to make me ready At tenne, and pray till dinner, I will play At gleeke as often as I please, and see Playes when I have a minde to't and the races, Though men sho'd runne Adamits before me. Fa. None of these trench on what I have to aske. Ca. Why then I sweareâstay You shannot aske me before company How old I am, a question most untoothsome, I know not what to say more, Ile not be Bound from spring garden, and the Sparagus. I wo'not have my tongue tyde up, when Iv'e a minde to jeere my suitors, among which Your worship shall not doubt to be remembred, For I must have my humor, I am sicke else; I will not be compeld to heare your sonnets, A thing before, I thought to advise you of, Your words of hard concoction rude Poetry Have much impayred my health, try sence another while And calculate some prose according to The elevation of our pole at London, As sayes the learned Almanackeâbut come on And speake your minde, I ha done, I know not what More to except, if it be none of these And as you say feazable on my part, I sweare. Fa. By what. Ca. For once a kisse, it may be a parting blow, By that I will performe what you desire. Fa. In few words thus receive it, by that oath I binde you, never to desire my company Hereafter, for no reason to affect me, This I am sure was none of your exceptions. Ca. What has the man sayd? Fa. Tis cleere, I am confident To your understanding. Ca. You have made me sweare That I must never love you, nor desire Your company. Fa. I know you will not violate, What you have sworne, so all good thoughts possesse you. Ca. Was all this circumstance for this? I never Exit. Found any inclination to trouble him With too much love, why should he binde me from it, And make me sweare, an oath, that for the present, I had no affection to him, had beene reasonable, But for the time to come, never to love, For any cause or reason, that may move me Hereafter, very strange, I know not what to thinke on't, Although I never meant, to thinke well on him, Yet to be limitted, and be prescrib'd, I must not doe it? twas a poore tricke in him, But Ile goe practise something to forget it.</field>

What? what durst thou venture now, and be plaine wo'me. Iu. There's nothing in the verge of my command That should not serve your Lordship. Lo. Speake, speake truth and flatter not, Vpon what security? Iu. On that which you propounded sir, your honour, It is above all other obligation, And he that's truely noble will not staine it. Lo: Vpon my honour will you lend me then But a nights lodging. Iu. How sir. Lo. She is angry I shall obtaine, I know the tricke out, had She yeelded at the first it had beene fatall. Iu. It seemes your Lordship speakes to one you know not. Lo. But I desire to know you better Lady. Iu. Better! I should desire my Lord. Lo. Better or worse, if you dare venture one, Ile hazard t'other. Iu. Tis your Lordships mirth. Lo. Y'are in the right, tis the best mirth of all. Iu. Ile not beleeve my Lord you meane so wantonly As you professe. Lo. Refuse me if I doe not Not meane? I hope you have more Charity Then to suspect, Ile not performe as much, And more than I ha said, I know my fault, I am too modest when I undertake, But when I am to Act let me alone. Tr. You shall be alone no longer My good Lord. Lo. Franck Tryer. Tr. Which side holds your honour. Lo. I am o'thy side Franck. Tr. I thinke so! for All the Park's against me, but 6. to 4. Is oddes enough. Iu. Is it so much against you. Tr. Lady I thinke tis two, to one. Lo. We were on even termes till you came hither, I finde her yeelding, and when they doe run? Tr. They say presently. Lo. Will you venture any thing Lady? Tr. Perhaps she reserves her selfe for the horse race. Iu. There I may venture somewhat with his Lordship. Lo: That was a witty one. Tr.

Though she should winne, it would be held extortion To take your money. Iu. Rather want of modesty, A great sinne if you observe the circumstance, I see his Lordshippe has a disposition To be merry, but proclaime not this free laye To every one, some women in the world Would hold you all day.

How dee like this gallant. Iu. Hee's one it becomes not me to censure. Tr. Dee not finde him coming, a wilde gentleman You may in time convert him. Iu. You made me acquainted with him to that purpose, It was your confidence, Ile do what I can, Because he is your noble Friend, and one In whom was hid so much perfection Of honour, for at first 'twas most invisible, But it begins to appeare, and I do perceive A glimering, it may breake out a flame, I shall know all his thoughts at our next conference, He has a secret to impart he sayes only to me. Tr. And will you heare it? Iu. Yes Sir, if it be honourable there is no harme in't, If otherwise you do not doubt my innocence. Tr. But do not tempt a danger. Iu. From his Lordship. Tr. I do not say from him. Iu. From mine owne frailety. Tr. I dare not conclude that but from the matter Of his discourse, on which there may depend A circumstance that may not prove so happy. Iu. Now I must tell you Sir, I see your heart Is not so just as I deserve, you have Engag'd me to his conversation, Provok'd by jealous thoughts, and now your feare Betrayes your want of goodnes, for he never was right at home, that dare suspect his Mistris, Can love degenerate in noble breasts, Collect the arguments, that could invite you To this unworthy tryall, bring them to My forehead, where you shall inscribe their names For virgins to blush at me, if I do not Fairely acquit my selfe. Tr. Nay be not passionate. Iu.

Bo. How is that? the matter May spread too farre, some former quarrell, tis My best to reconcile em, sir I may Be ignorant if any thing have past Before this morning, I pray pardon me But as you are a gentleman, let me Prevaile, your differences may here conclude; 'Las I am part of him now, and betweene A Widdow and his wife, if I be thus Divorc'dâ M. B. Ile be his servant. Bo. Sir you shew A noble disposition, good my Lord Compose their differences, prethee meete his friendship. M. B. I have satisfaction, and desire his love. La. Th'ast done but like a gentleman, thy hand Ile love thee while I live. Lo. Why so all friends. M. B. I meete it with a heart, and for disturbing Your mirth to day. La. No, no disturbance. M. B. Then give me but the favour To shew I wish no sorrow to the bride, I have a small oblation, which she must Accept, or I shall doubt we are not friends, Tis all I have to offer at your Wedding. Bo. Ha. M. B. There's my hand to justifie it at fit time, Peruse it, my Lord I shall be studious How to deserve your favour. Lo. I am yours. La. My Lord let me obtaine, youle honour me To night. Mr i s.

Iu. How! Ca. Nay I speake no conjecture, I have more Intelligence than you imagine, you are his sister, And nature binds you to affect his safety, By some convenient Messenger send for him; But as you love his life doe not delay it; Alas I shall be sorry, any gentleman Should for my sake take any desparate course. Iu. But are you serious? Ca. Perhaps good counsell Applyed while his despaire is greene may cure him, If not? Iu. You make me wonder. Ca. I know the inconsiderate will blame Me for his death, I shall be rall'd upon And have a thousand cruelties throwne on me, But would you have me promise love and flatter him? I would doe much to save his life, I could Shew you a paper, that would make you bleed To see his resolution, and what Strange and unimitable wayes he has Vow'd to pursue, I tremble to thinke on em.

Fa. I acknowlede That empty wishes are their shame, that have Ability to doe a Noble worke, And flye the Action. Lo.

T'were better not to have beene borne to honours, Than forfeit em so poorely, he is truely Noble, and best justifies his blood When he can number the descents of vertue. Lo. You'le not degrade me. Iu. Tis not in my power Or will my Lord, and yet you presse me strangely As y'are a person, separate and distinct By your high blood, above me and my fortunes Thus low I bend, you have no noble title Which I not bow to, they are Characters Which we should read at distance, and there is Not one that shall with more devotion And honour of your birth, expresse her service, It is my duty, where the king has seal'd His favours, I should shew humility My best obedience to his act. Lo. So should All hansome women that will be good subjects. Iu. But if to all those honourable names, That mark'd you for the peoples reverence, In such a vitious age, you dare rise up Example too of goodnesse, they which teach Their knees a Complement, will give their heart, And I among the number of the humblest Most proud to serve your Lordship, and would refuse No office or command, that should engage me To any noble tryall, this addition Of vertue is above all shine of State, And will draw more admirers; but I must Be bold to tell you sir, unlesse you prove A friend to vertue were your honour centupled, Could you pile titles till you reach the Clouds. Were every petty Mannor you possesse A Kingdome, and the bloud of many Princes Vnited in your veynes, with these had you A person that had more attraction Then Poesie can furnish, love withall, Yet I, I in such infinite distance am As much above you in my innocence. Lo. This becomes not. Iu. Tis the first libertie I ever tooke to speake my selfe, I have Bin bold in the comparison, but find not Wherein I have wrong'd vertue, pleading for it. Lo. How long will you continue thus? Iu. I wish To have my last houre witnesse of these thoughts, And I will hope before that time, to heare Your Lordship of another minde. Lo. I know not, Tis time enough to thinke o'that hereafter, Ile bee a convertite within these two daies, Vpon condition you and I may have One bout to night, no body heares. Iu. Alas you plunge too farre, and are within this minute, Further from heaven then ever. Lo. I may live To requite the curtesie. Iu. Live my Lord to be Your Countries honour and support, and thinke not Of these poore dreames. Lo. I find not desire to sleepe, and I were a bed wee. Iu. Tis not improbable my Lord but you May live to be an old man, and fill up A seate among the grave Nobility, When your colde bloud shall starve your wanton thoughts, And your slow pulse beate like your bodies knell, When time hath snow'd upon your haire, oh then Will it be any comfort to remember The sinnes of your wild youth, how many wives, Or virgins y'ave dishonour'd? in their number, Would any memory of me (should I Be sinfull to consent) not fetch a teare, From you perhaps a sigh to breake your heart, Will you not wish then you had never mixt With Atheists, and those men whose wits are vented In oathes, and blasphemy, now the pride of Gentlemen, That strike at heaven, and make againe of thunder. Lo. If this be true? what a wretched thing should I Appeare now, if I were any thing but a Lord, I do not like my selfe, give me thy hand Since there is no remedy, be honest! theres no harme I'this I hope, I wonot tell thee all My minde at once, If I doe returne Carthusian, And renounce flesh upon this, the devill is like To ha the worst ontâbut I am expected.

Yours till his necke be broke, Fairefeild. Ca. Is it not? Whither is fled your piety! but sir I have no meaning to exasperate Thoughts that oppose your safety, and to shew I have compassion, and delight in no Mans ruine, I wil frame my selfe to love you. Fa. Will you? why thanke you! Ca. Heres my hand I will; Be comforted, I have a stronger faith. Fa. I see then you haue charity for an need. Ca.
