      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Bartello, and Silvio. Sil. Tis true she is a right good Princes, and a just one, And Florence when she sets has lost a Planet. Bar. My Mistris? I tell thee gentle Nephew, There is not such another friend to goodnesse, To down-right dealing, to faith and true heart Within the Christian confines: Before she blest us, Iustice was a Cheese-monger, a meere Cheese-monger, Weigh'd nothing to the World but mytes and maggots, And a maine stinke: Law like a Horse-courser, Her rules, and precepts hung with gawdes and ribbonds, And pamper'd up to cousen him that bought her, When she her selfe was hackney lame and founder'd. Sil. But the sweet Lady, Belvidere the bright oneâ Bar. I, there's a face indeed: O my deare Nephew, Could a young fellow of thy fiery mettle Freeze, and that Lady in his armes? Sil. I think not. Bar. Thou hast a parlous judgement; but let that passe, She is as truly vertuous, faire, and noble, As her great Mother's good; and that's not ordinary. Sil. But why (so many Princes, and so great ones Being Suitors) should the Dutchesse deny to match her? Bar. She is a Jewell man, hangs in her bosome, Her only Childe: with her eyes she sees all things, Discourses with her tongue, and pluck her from her So dotingly the old one loves her young one) You pluck her heart out too: Besides, of late daies, The Duke of Millaine, who could never win her By love, nor treaty, laid a close traine for her In her owne private walkes: some forty Horse-men, So to surprize her; which we found, and dealt with, And sent 'em running home to the Duke their Master, Like Doggs with bottles at their tailes. Sil. Since that, I heard Sir, She has sent her to your Cittadell to secure her, My cousen Rodope, your wife attending her. Bar. You heare a truth, and all convenient pleasures Are there proportion'd for her. Sil. I would faine Sir, Like one that owes a dutious service to her Sometimes, so please youâ Bar. Gentle Cousen pardon me, I must not, nor you must not dare to offer, The last Edict lyes on his life pursues it; Your friend Sir to command, abroad to love you, To lend ye any thing I have, to wait upon ye, But in the Cittadell where I stand charg'd, Not a bit upon a march: no service Sir, No, good Sir by no meanes: I kisse your hands Sir. Exit. Sil. To your keeping only? none else to look upon her? None but Bartello worthy her attendance? No faith but his to serve her? O Belvidere, Thou Saint to whom my youth is sacrific'd, Thou point to which my life turnes, and my fortune, Art thou lock'd from me now? from all my comforts, Art thou snatch'd violently? thou hear'st me not, Nor canst thou see (faire soule) thy Servants mournings, Yet let thy gentle heart feele what his absence, The great divorce of minds so truly loving, So long, and nurs'd in one affection Even from our infant eyes, suck'd in and nourish'd: O let it feele but that, and there stand constant And I am blest. My deare Neece Rodope, That is her Governesse, did love me dearely, There's one hope yet to see her: when he is absent It may be ventur'd, and she may work it closely: I know the Ladies will goes equall with me, And so the danger of the Edict avoyded; Let me think more, for I must try all hazards. Enter Claudio, and Soto. Soto. Will ye go yonder Sir? Cla. Yes marry will I Sir. Soto. And by this Ladder? Cla. By that Ladder, coxcomb. Soto. Have ye any more necks at home when this is broken, For this will crack with the best friend he has Sir? Or can you pitch of all foure, like an Ape now? Let me see you tumble. Cla. You are very pleasant Sir. Soto. No truly Sir, I should be loath to see ye Come fluttering down like a yong Rooke, cry squab, And take ye up with your brains beaten into your buttocks Cla. Hold your peace Asse: who's this stands musing here? Silvio? Sil. Who calls me? Cla. One most glad to see you Sir. Sil. My dearest Claudio? what make you thus private, And with a preparation of this nature? Soto. We have leave to play, and are going to climbe Birds nests. Sil. Prethee what is it friend? why start ye from me? Is your old Mistris growne so coy and cruell, She must be scal'd? it seemes you are loath to tell me, Since twenty yeares continuance of our friendship May not be worth the weight of such a secret, 'Twill be but rude to aske againe: 'save ye. Cla. Nay stay, deare Silvio, if you love me take it: For till you know it, never woman labour'd As I do now. Sil. Ile do my best to ease it. Cla. You have heard the Lady Belvidereâ Sil. What heard Sir? Cla. Heard to the Cittadell, upon some feares She is confin'd. Sil. Why dreames he on this beauty? 'Tis true, I have heard it. Cla. And that no accesse, No blessing from those eyes but with much hazard, Even hazard of a life. Sil. He dares not love her; I have heard that too: but whither points your purpose? Cla. O Silvio, let me speake that none may heare me, None but thy truth: I have lov'd this Lady long, Long given away my life to her devotion, Long dwelt upon that beauty to my ruine. Sil. Do's she know this? Cla. No, there begins my misery, Ixion-like, I have onely yet clasp'd Clouds, And fed upon poore empty dreames that starve me. Sil. And what do you meane to do now? Cla. Though I dye for't, Though all the tortures in the world hung on me, Arm'd with imperious Love, I stand prepar'd now, With this to reach her Chamber: there to see her, And tell her boldly with what truth I love her. Sil. 'Twill not be easily done Sir. Cla. O my Silvio, The hardest things are sweetest in possession. Sil. Nor will shew much discretion. Cla. Love is blinde man, And he that lookes for reason there far blinder. Sil. Have ye consider'd ripely? Cla. All that may fall, And arm'd against that all. Sil. Her honour too? What she may suffer in this rash adventure? The beauty of her name? Cla. Ile do it closely, And only at her window, with that cautionâ Sil. Are there no Guards? Cla. Corruption chokes their service. Sil. Or do you hold her bred so light a woman To hold commerce with strange tongues? Cla. Why this service, This only hazard of my life must tell her, Though she were Vestas selfe, I must deserve her. Sil. I would not have ye go: pray let it sinke here, And think a nobler way to raise your service, A safer, and a wiser. Cla. 'Tis too late Sir. Sil. Then I must say, You shall not go. Cla. I shall not? Sil. You shall not go: that part bred with ye, friendship Bids me say boldly so, and you observe me. Cla. You stretch that tye too far. Sil. Ile stretch it farther: The honour that I beare that spotlesse vertue You fouly seeke to taint, unnobly covet, Bids me command ye stay: if not, thus force ye. Soto. This will be worse then climbing. Cla. Why do ye draw Sir? Sil. To kill thee, if thy base will be thy Master. Cla. I ever was your friend. Sil. Whilst thou wert honest, And not a Night-theife of anothers honour; I never call'd a Foole my friend, a mad-man, That durst expose his fame to all opinions, His life to unhonest dangers: I never lov'd him, Durst know his name, that sought a Virgins ruine, Nor ever tooke I pleasure in acquaintance With men, that give as loose raynes to their fancies As the wilde Ocean to his raging fluxes: A noble soule I twin with, and my love Followes, his life dares master his affections. Will ye give off, or fight? Cla. I will not fight with ye: The sacred name of friend tyes up that anger, Rather ile study. Sil. Do, to be a friend still. Cla. If this way, I shall never hold. Sil. Ile watch ye: And if I catch ye false: by Heaven ye dye for't, All love forgot. Cla. When I feare that I am fit for't. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter Lopez at a Table with jewels and money upon it, an Egge rosting by a Candle. Lop. Whilst prodigall yong gaudy Fools are banqueting, And launching out their states to catch the giddy, Thus do I study to preserve my fortune, And hatch with care at home the wealth that Saints me. Here's Rubies of Bengala, rich, rich, glorious; These Diamonds of Ormus bought for little, Here vented at the price of Princes Ransomes; How bright they shine like constellations, The South seas treasure here, Pearle, faire and orient Able to equall Cleapatra's Banket, Here chaines of lesser stones for Ladies lustres, Ingotts of Gold, Rings, Brooches, barrs of Silver, These are my studies to set off in sale well, And not in sensuall surfeits to consume 'em; How rosts mine egg? he heats apace, ile turne him: Penurio, where you knave do you wait? Penurio, You lazie knave. Pen. Did you call Sir? Lop. Where's your Mistris? What vanity holds her from her attendance? Pen. The very sight of this egge has made his cockish, What would a dozen butter'd do? She is within Sir. Lop. Within Sir, at what thrift ye knave? what getting? Pen. Getting a good stomack Sir, &amp; she knew where to get meat to it, She is praying heartily upon her knees Sir, That Heaven would send her a good bearing dinner. Lop. Nothing but gluttony and surfeit thought on, Health flung behinde: had she not yesternight sirrah Two Sprats to supper, and the oyle allowable? Was she not sick with eating? Hadst not thou, (Thou most vngratefull knave, that nothing satisfies) The water that I boyl'd my other egge in To make thee hearty broth? Pen. 'Tis true, I had Sir; But I might as soone make the Philosophers Stone on't, You gave it me in water, and but for manners sake, I could give it you againe in wind, it was so hearty I shall turne pissing Conduit shortly: my Mistris comes Sir. Enter Isabella. Lop. Welcome my Dove. Isab. Pray ye keep your welcome to ye, Unlesse it carries more then words to please me, Is this the joy to be a Wife? to bring with me, Besides the noblenesse of blood I spring from, A full and able portion to maintaine me? Is this the happinesse of youth and beauty, The great content of being made a Mistris, To live a Slave subject to wants, and hungers, To jealousies for every eye that wanders? Unmanly jealousie. Lop. Good Isabella. Isab. Too good for you: do you think to famish me, Or keep me like an Almes-woman in such rayment, Such poore unhandsome weeds? am I old, or ugly? I never was bred thus: and if your misery Will suffer wilfull blindnesse to abuse me, My patience shall be no Bawd to mine owne ruine. Pen. Tickle him Mistris: to him. Isab. Had ye love in ye, Or any patt of manâ Pen. Follow that Mistris. Isab. Or had humanity but ever knowne ye, You would shame to use a woman of my way thus, So poore, and basely: you are strangly jealous of me If I should give ye cause. Lop. How Isabella? Isab. As do not venture this way to provoke me. Pen. Excellent well Mistris, Lop. How's this Isabella? Isab. 'Twill stir a Saint, and I am but a woman, And by that tenure may. Lop. By no meanes Chicken, You know I love ye: fie, take no example By those young gadding Dames: (you are noted vertuous) That stick their Husbands wealth in trifles on 'em And point 'em but the way to their owne miseries: I am not jealous, kisse me,âI am not: And for your diet, 'tis to keep you healthfull, Surfits destroy more then the sword: that I am carefull Your meat should be both neat, and cleanly handled See, Sweet, I am Cook my selfe, and mine owne Cater. Pen. Aâof that Cook cannot lick his fingers. Lop. Ile adde another dish: you shall have Milke to it, 'Tis nourishing and good. Pen. With Butter in't Sir? Lop. This knave would breed a famine in a Kingdom: And cloths that shall content ye: you must be wise then, And live sequestred to your selfe and me, Not wandring after every toy comes crosse ye, Nor strooke with every spleene: what's the knave doing? Penurio. Pen. Hunting Sir, for a second course of flyes here, They are rare new Sallads. Lop. For certaine Isabella This ravening fellow has a Woolf in's belly: Untemperate knave, will nothing quench thy appetite? I saw him eat two Apples, which is monstrous. Pen. If you had given me those 'thad bin more monstr?s. Lop. 'Tis a maine miracle to feed this villaine, Come Isabella, let us in to Supper, And think the Romane dainties at our Table, 'Tis all but thought. Exeunt. Pen. Would all my thoughts would do it: The Devill should think of purchasing that Egge-shell, To vittle out a Witch for the Burmoothes: 'Tis treason to any good stomack living now To heare a tedious Grace said, and no meat to't, I have a Radish yet, but that's but transitory. Exit. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Soto. Soto. Can any living man unlesse a Rascall That neither knowes himselfe, nor a fashion'd Gentleman Take me for a worse man then my Master now? I am naturally proud in these cloths: but if pride now Should catch a fall in what I am attempting, 'Tis but a Proverb sound, and a Neck broken, That's the worst can come on't: a Gentleman's gone then, A Gentleman oth' first house, there's the end on't: My Master lyes most pittifully complaining, Wringing and kicking up toth' eares in love yonder, And such a lamentable noyse he keepes, it kills me: I have got his cloths, and if I can get to her By hooke or crooke here, such a song ile sing herâ I think I shall be hang'd, but that's no matter, What's a hanging among friends: I am valiant now as an Elephant; I have consider'd what to say too: let me see now, This is the place, 'tis plaguy high: stay at that lower window Let me ayme finely now, like a good Gunner, It may prove but a whipping. Enter Silvio. Sil. I saw some-body Passe by me now, and though it were dark, me thought yet I knew the clothes: ha, let me not be cozen'd, The Ladder too, ready to fling it? monstrous, 'Tis he, 'tis Claudio: most voluptuous villaine, Scandall to womans credit: Love, I forget thee. Soto. What will he do ith' name of heaven, what's that there? Sil. And all the friendship that I bore thee, bury here. Soto. What has he in's hand? I hope but a Cudgell. Sil. Thy fault's forgive O Heaven: farewell thou traitor. Soto. I am slaine: I am slaine. Sil. He's downe, and dead: dead certaine, 'Twas too rash, too full of spleene, stark dead: This is no place now to repent in, onely Would I had given this hand that shot the Pistoll I had miss'd thee, and thou wert once more Claudio. Exit. Enter Claudio. Cla. Why should I love thus foolishly? thus desperatly? And give away my heart where no hope's left me? Why should not the true counsell of a friend restraine me? The Devills mouth I run into affright me, The honour of the Lady charme my wildnesse; I have no power, no being of my selfe, No reason strong enough now left within me To binde my will: O Love, thou God, or Devill, Or what thou art that playes the tyrant in me. Soto. Oh. Cla. What's that cry? Soto. A Surgeon, a Surgeon, Twenty good Surgeons. Cla. 'Tis not far from me, Some Murther o' my life, Soto. Will you let me dye here? No drink come, nor no Surgeon? Cla. 'Tis my man sure, His voyce, and here he lyes: how is it with thee? Sot. I am slaine, Sir, I am slaine. Cla. Slaine? Who has slaine thee? Soto. Kill'd, kill'd, out-right kill'd. Cla. Where's thy hurt? Soto. I know not, But I am sure I am kill'd. Cla. Canst thou sit up, That I may finde the hurt out? Soto. I can sit up, But ne're the lesse I am slaine. Cla. 'Tis not o'this side? Soto. No Sir, I thinke it be not. Cla. Nor o'this side, Was it done with a Sword? Soto. A Gun, a Gun sweet Master. Cla. The devill a'bullet has been here: thou art well, man. Soto. No sure, I am kill'd. Cla. Let me see thy thighes, and belly, As whole as a fish for any thing I see yet: Thou bleed'st no where. Soto. I thinke I do not bleed Sir, But yet I am afraid I am slaine. Cla. Stand up Foole, Thou hast as much hurt as my naile: who shot thee, A Pottle, or a Pinte? Soto. Signiour Silvio shot me In these clothes, taking me for you, and seeing The Ladder in my hand here, which I stole from ye, Thinking to have gone to the Lady my selfe, &amp; have spoke for ye Cla. If he had hit ye home, he had serv'd ye right sirra, You sawcy rogue, how poore my intent showes to me, How naked now, and foolish? Soto. Are ye sure he has not hit me, It gave a monstruous bounce? Cla. You risse of your right side, And said your prayers too, you had been payed else: But what need'st thou a Bullet when thy feare kills thee? Sirrah, keep your own counsell for all this, you'l be hang'd else, If it be knowne. Soto. If it be by my meanes let me; I am glad I am not kill'd, and far more gladder My gentleman-like humours out: I feele 'tis dangerous, And to be a gentleman, is to be kill'd twice a week. Cla. Keepe your selfe close ith' Country for a while sirra. There's Money, walk to your friends. Soto. They have no Pistolls, Nor are no Gentlemen, that's my comfort. Exit. Cla. I will retire too, and live private; for this Silvio Inflam'd with noblenesse will be my death else; And if I can forget this love that loades me, At least the danger: and now I think on't better, I have some conclusions else invites me to it.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Rodope, and Silvio at severall doores. Rod. Nephew. Sil. My deare Ant. Rod. Would you goe by thus slily And never see me, not once send in to me Your loving Neece? she that above all those I call my Kindred honour'd you, and placed you Nearest my heart? Sil. I thanke you worthy Cousen, But such at this time are my occasionsâ Rod. You shall not goe yet, by my faith you shall not, I will not be deny'd: why looke ye sad Nephew? Sil. I am seldome other: O, this blood sits heavy: As I walk't this way late last night, In meditation of some things concern'd meâ Rod. What Nephew? Sil. Why me thought I heard a Peece, Lady, A peece shot off, much about this place too, But could not judge the cause, nor what it boaded, Under the Castle wall. Rod. We heard it too, And the Watch pursu'd it presently, but found nothing, Not any tract. Sil. I am right glad to heare it: The Ruffians surely, that command the night Have found him, stript him: and into the River Convey'd the body. Rod. You looke still sadder, Nephew, Is any thing within these walls to comfort ye? Speake, and be Master of it. Sil. Ye are a right Courtier, A great Professor, but a poore performer. Rod. Do you doubt my faith: you never found me that way I dare well speake it boldly, but a true friend. Sil. Continue then. Rod. Try me, and see who falters. Sil. I will, and presently: 'tis in your power To make me the most bound man to your courtesie. Rod. Let me know how, and if I faileâ Sil. 'Tis thus then, Get me accesse to the Lady Belvidere But for a minute, but to see her: your Husband now Is safe at Court, I left him full employ'd there. Rod. You have ask'd the thing without my power to grant ye, The Law lyes on the danger: if I lov'd ye not I would bid ye goe, and there be found, and dye for't. Sil. I knew your love, and where there shew'd a danger How far you durst step for me: give me a true friend, That where occasion is to doe a benefit Aymes at the end, and not the rubs before it; I was a foole to aske ye this, a more foole To thinke a woman had so much noble nature To entertaine a secret of this burthen; Ye had best to tell the Dutchesse I perswaded ye, That's a fine course, and one will win ye credit; Forget the name of Cousen, blot my blood out, And so you raise your selfe, let me grow shorter. A woman friend? he that beleeves that weaknesse Steeres in a stormy night without a Compasse. Rod. What is't I durst not do might not impeach ye? Sil. Why this ye dare not do, ye dare not thinke of. Rod. 'Tis a maine hazard. Sil. If it were not so I would not come to you to seeke a favour. Rod. You will lose your selfe. Sil. The losse ends with my selfe then. Rod. You will but see her? Sil. Onely looke upon her. Rod. Not stay? Sil. Prescribe your time. Rod. Not traffique with her In any close dishonourable actions? Sil. Stand you your selfe by. Rod. I will venture for ye, Because ye shall be sure I am a touch'd friend, Ile bring her to ye: come walke, you know the Garden, And take this key to open the little Posterne, There stand no guards. Sil. I shall soone finde it Cousen. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter two Souldiers. 1 Sol. Is the Captaine come home? 2 Sol. No, who commands the Guard to night? 1 Sol. I thinke Petruchio. 2 Sol. What's the Word? 1 Sol. None knowes yet. 2 Sol. I would this Lady were married out oth' way once, Or out of our custodies; I wish they wold take in more companies, For I am sure we feel her in our duties shrewdly. 1 Sol. 'Tis not her fault I warrant ye, she is ready for't, And that's the plague, when they grow ripe for marriage They must be slipt like Hawkes. 2 Sol. Give me a meane wench, No State doubt lyes on her, she is alwaies ready. 1 Sol. Come to the Guard, 'tis late, and sure the Captaine Can not be long away. 2 Sol. I have watch'd these three nights, To morrow they may keep me tame for nothing. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Silvio, Belvidere, and Rodope with a light. Sil. This is the place I think; what Light is that there? The Lady and my Cousen? Bel. Is this the Garden? Rod. Yes Madam. Sil. O my blessed Mistris, Saint of my soule. Bel. Speake softly: take me to ye, O Silvio I am thine, thine ever Silvio. Rod. Is this your promise Sir? Lady your honour? I am undone if this be seene, disgrac'd, Fallen under all discredit. Bel. Do you love still? Deere, do you keepe your old faith? Sil. Ever Lady; And when that failes me, all that's good forsake me. Rod. Do not you shame? Madam, I must not suffer this, I will not suffer it; men call you vertuous, What do you meane to lose your selfe thus? Silvio I charge thee get away, charge you retire ye, Ile call the watch else. Sil. Call all the world to see us, We live in one anothers happinesse, And so will die. Bel. Here will I hang for ever. Rod. As ye respect me, as hereafter Madam You would enjoy his loveânothing prevaile with ye? I'le try my strength then; get thee gone thou villain, Thou Promise-breaker. Sil. I am tide, I cannot. Rod. Ile ring the Bell then. Sil. Ring it to death, I am fixt here. Enter Bartello, two Souldiers with lights. Bart. I saw a light over the Garden walke, Hard by the Ladies Chamber, here's some knavery As I live, I saw it twice. Rod. The Guard, the Guard there; I must not suffer this, it is too mischievous. Bart. Light up the torch, I fear'd this, ha? young Silvio? How got he in? 1. Sold. The Divell brought him in sure He came not by us. Bart. My wife between 'em busling? Guard, pull him off. Rod. Now, now, ye feele the misery. Bart. You, Madam, at an houre so far undecent? Death, O my soule! this is a foule fault in ye, Your mothers care abusd too, light's to her Chamber, I am sorry to see this. Bell. Farewell my Sylvio, And let no danger sink thee. Sil. Nor death Lady. Exit. Bell. Rod. Bart. Are ye so hot? I shall prepare ye Phisick Will purge ye finely, neatly; you are too fiery, Think of your prayers, Sir, and you have not forgot 'em; Can ye fly i'th ayre, or creepe ye in at key-holes? I have a gyn will catch ye though you conjur'd: Take him to Guard to night, to strong and sure Guard; Ile back to'th Dutchesse presently: no lesse sport serve ye, Then the Heire to a Dukedom? play at push-pin there Sir? It was well aim'd, but plague upon't, you shot short, And that will lose your game. Sil. I know the losse then. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Quarta. Enter Claudio (like a Merchant.) Cla. Now, in this habit may I safely see How my incensed friend carries my murther, Who little I imagin'd had been wrought To such a height of rage; and much I grieve now Mine owne blinde passion had so master'd me, I could not see his love, for sure he loves her, And on a nobler ground then I pretended. Enter Penurio. It must be so, it is so; what Penurio, My shotten friend, what winde blew you? Pen. Faith 'tis true, Any strong winde will blow me like a feather, I am all Ayre, nothing of earth within me, Nor have not had this moneth, but that good Dinner Your Worship gave me yesterday, that staies by me, And gives me ballasse, else the Sun would draw me. Cla. But do's my Mistris speake still of me? Pen. Yes Sir, And in her sleep, that makes my Master mad too, And turne and fart for anger. Cla. Are sure she saw me? Pen. She saw ye at a window. Cla. 'Tis most true, In such a place I saw a Gentlewoman, A young, sweet hansome woman. Pen. That's she, that's she Sir. Cla. And well she view'd me, I view'd her. Pen. Still she Sir. Cla. At last she blush'd, and then look't off. Pen. That blush Sir, If you can read it trulyâ Cla. But didst thou tell her, Or didst thou foole me, thou knew'st such a one? Pen. I told her, and I told her such a sweet taleâ Cla. But did she heare thee? Pen. With a thousand eares Sir, And swallow'd what I said as greedily, As great-bellyed women do Cherries, stones and all Sir. Cla. Methinkes she should not love thy Master? Pen. Hang him Pilcher, There's nothing loves him: his owne Cat cannot endure him, She had better lye with a Beare, for he is so hairie, That a tame warren of flyes frisk round about him. Cla. And wilt thou worke still? Pen. Like a Miner for ye. Cla. And get accesse. Pen. Or conjure you together, 'Tis her desire to meet: she is poyson'd with him, And till she take a sweet fresh ayre, that's you Sir. Cla. There's money for thee: thou art a precious Varlet, Be fat, be fat, and blow thy Master backward. Pen. Blow you my Mistris Sir, as flat as a flounder, Then blow her up againe as Butchers blow their Veales; If she dye upon the same Bury her, bury her in Gods name. Cla. Thou art a merry knave: by this hand ile feed thee, Till thou crack'st at both ends, if thou dar'st do this Thou shalt eat no fantasticall Porredge, Nor lick the dish where oyle was yesterday, Dust, and dead flyes to day; Capons, fat Caponsâ Pen. O hearty sound. Cla. Cramb'd full of itching Oysters. Pen. Will ye have the Dutchesse? Cla. And Lobsters big as Gauntlets, Thou shalt despise base Beefe. Pen. I do despise it, And now me thinkes I feele a Tart come sliding. Cla. Leaping into thy mouth: but first deale faithfully. Pen. When will ye come? Cla. To morrow. Pen. Ile attend ye, For then my Master will be out in businesse. Cla. What newes abroad? Pen. 'Mas as I was comming to you, I heard that Signiour Silvio, a good Gentleman, Many a good meale I have eaten with himâ Cla. What of him? Pen. Was this day to be Arraigned before the Duchesse, But why I could not heare. Cla. Silvio arraign'd? Go, get ye gone, and thinke of me. Pen. I fly Sir. Exit Pen. Cla. Arraign'd? for what? for my supposed death? no, That cannot be sure, there's no rumour of it, Be it what it will, I will be there and see it, And if my help will bring him off he has it. Exit. ScÃ¦na Quinta. Enter Duchesse, Lords, Silvio prisoner, Belvidere, Bartello, Rodope, Clerke, Counsellours, Attendants. Du. Read the Edict last made, Keepe silence there. Clerk. If any man of what condition soever, and a subject, after the publishing of this Edict, shall without speciall Licence from the great Duchesse, attempt or buy, offer, or make an attempt, to solicite the love of the Princesse Belvidere, the person so offending shall forfeit his life. Counsellour. The reason why my Royall Mistris here In her last Treaty with Siennas Duke, Promis'd her beauteous Daughter there in marriage, The Duke of Millaine, rivall in this fortune, Un-nobly sought by practise to betray her; Which found, and cross'd, the Cittadell receiv'd her There to secure her Mothers word; the last cause So many Gentlemen of late enamour'd On this most beauteous Princesse, and not brooking One more then other, to deserve a favour, Blood has been spilt, many brave spirits lost, And more unlesse she had been kept close from their violence Had like to have followed: therefore for due prevention Of all such hazards and unnoble actions, This last Edict was publish'd, which thou Silvio Like a false man, a bad man, and a Traitor Hast rent a peeces, and contemn'd; for which cause Thou standest a guilty man here now. Ent. Claudio. Clark. Speak Silvio, What canst thou say to avoyd the hand of Justice? Sil. Nothing, but I confesse, submit, &amp; lay my head to it. Bel. Have ye no eyes my Lords, no understandings? The Gentleman will cast himselfe away, Cast himselfe wilfully: are you, or you guilty? No more is he, no more taint sticks upon him: I drew him thether, 'twas my way betray'd him, I got the entrance kept, I entertain'd him, I hid the danger from him, forced him to me, Poore gentle soule, he's in no part transgressing, I wrot unto him. Sil. Do not wrong that honour, Cast not upon that purenesse these aspersions, By Heaven it was my love, my violence, My life must answer it: I broke in to her, Tempted the Law, sollicited unjustly. Bel. As there is truth in Heaven I was the first cause, How could this man have come to me, left naked Without my counsell and provision? What hower could he finde out to passe the Watchs, But I must make it sure first? Reverend Judges, Be not abus'd, nor let an innocent life lye Upon your shaking Conscience; I did it, My love the maine wheele that set him a going: His motion but compell'd. Sil. Can ye beleeve this, And know with what a modesty and whitenesse Her life was ever ranck'd? Can you beleeve this And see me here before ye young, and wilfull? Apt to what danger Love dares thrust me on, And where Law stops my way, apt to contemne it? If I were bashfull, old, or dull, and sleepy In Loves allarmes, a woman might awake me, Direct, and clew me out the way to happinesse: But I like fire, kindled with that bright beauty, Catch hold of all occasions, and run through 'em. Bel. I charge ye as your honest soules will answer it. Sil. I charge ye, as you are the friends to vertue, That has no patterne living but this Lady. Bel. Let not his bloodâ Sil. Let not her wilfulnesseâ For then you act a scene Hell will rejoyce at. Bel. He is cleare. Sil. She is as white in this as infants. Cla. The god of Love protect your cause, and help ye, Two nobler peeces of affection These eyes ne're look'd on, if such goodnesse perish, Let never true hearts meet againe, but break. Exit. 1 Lord. A strange example of strong love, a rare one. 2 Lord. Madam, we know not what to say to think on. Duch. I must confesse it strikes me tender too, Searches my Mothers heart: you found 'em there? Bar. Yes certaine Madam. Duch. And so linked together? Bar. As they had been one peece of Alablaster. Duch. Nothing dishonourable? Sil. So let my soule have happinesse, As that thought yet durst never seeke this bosome. Duch. What shall I do? 'has broke my Law, abus'd me, Faine would I know the truth, either confesse it, And let me understand the maine offender, Or both shall feele the torture. Sil. Are ye a Mother? The Mother of so sweet a Rose as this is? So pure a Flower? and dare ye lose that nature? Dare ye take to your selfe so great a wickednesse, (O holy Heaven) of thinking what may ruine This goodly building? this temple where the gods dwell? Give me a thousand tortures, I deserve 'em, And shew me death in all the shapes imagin'd. Bel. No death but I will answer it, meet it, seeke it; No torture but ile laugh upon't, and kisse it. 1 Lord. This is no way. 2 Lord. They say no more for certaine Then their strong hearts will suffer. Duch. I have bethought me; No Lords, although I have a Childe offending, Nature dares not forget she is a Childe still; Till now I never look'd on love imperious: I have bethought me of a way to breake ye, To separate, though not your loves your bodies: Silvio attend, ile be your Judge my selfe now, The sentence of your death (because my Daughter Will beare an equall part in your afflictions) I take away and pardon: this remaines then An easie, and a gentle punishment, And this shall be fulfill'd: because unnobly You have sought the love, and marriage of a Princesse, The absolute and sole Heire of this Dukedome, By that meanes as we must imagine strongly, To plant your selfe into this Rule hereafter, We here pronounce ye a man banish'd from us. Sil. For ever banish'd Lady? Duch. Yet more mercy, But for a yeare: and then againe in this place To make your full appearance: yet more pitty, If in that time you can absolve a question, Writ down within this scrowle, absolve it rightly, This Lady is your wife, and shall live with ye; If not, you loose your head. Sil. I take this honour, And humbly kisse those Royall hands. Duch. Receive it: Bartello, to your old guard take the Princesse, And so the Court break up. Sil. Farewell to all, And to that spotlesse heart my endlesse service. Exit. 1. Lord. What will this prove? 2. Lord. Ile tell you a yeare hence, Sir. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Sexta. Enter Penurio, Isabella, Claudio. Pen. Are you pleas'd now? have I not wrought this wonder Non eben fatto Signieur. Cla. Rarely Penurio. Pen. Close, close then, and work wax. Cla. I am studying for thee A dinner, that shall victuall thee for ten yeare. Pen. Do you heare Mistris? You know what a dundier whelp my Master is, I need not preach to ye, how unfit and wanting To give a woman satisfaction: How he stinks, and snores, a Bull's a better bed-fellow; And for his love never let that deceive ye. Isab. Nay sure he loves me not. Pen. If he could coyne ye, Or turne ye into mettle much might be then; He loves not any thing but what is traffique: I have heard him sweare he would sell ye to the grand Signior. Isab. The Turk. Pen. The very Turke, and how they would use ye. Isab. Ile fit him fort: the Turke? Pen. I know the price too: Now ye have time to pay him, pay him home Mistris; Pay him o'th pate, clout him for all his curtesies; Here's one that daunces in your eyes, young delicate To work this vengeance; if ye let it slip now, There is no pittying of ye, od's precious, Mistris, Were I his wife, I would so mall his Mazard, 'Tis charity, meere charity, pure charity, Are you the first? has it not been from Eves time, Women would have their safe revenges this way? And good, and gracious women, excellent women; Is't not a handsome Gentleman? a sweet Gentleman? View him from head to foot, a compleat Gentleman; When can ye hope the like againe? I leave ye, And my revenge too, with ye; I know my Office, Ile not be farre off, be not long a fumbling, When danger shall appeare, Ile give the larme. Exit. Isab. You are welcome Sir, and would it were my fortune To afford a Gentleman of your faire seeming, A freer entertainment then this house has, You partly know Sir.â Cla. Know, and pitty Lady, Such sweetnesse in the bud, should be so blasted; Dare you make me your Servant? Isab. Dare you make Sir, That service worthy of a womans favour By constancy and goodnesse? Cla. Here I sweare to ye, By the unvalued love I beare this beauty, (And kisse the Book too) never to be recreant, To honour ye, to truly love, and serve ye, My youth to wait upon ye, what my wealth has. Isab. O make me not so poore, to sell affection, Those bought love's Sir, weare faster then the moneys; A handsome Gentleman. Cla. A most delicate sweet one, Let my truth Purchase then. Isab. I should first try it, But you may happily.â Cla. You shall not doubt me, I hope she loves me; when I prove false shame take me; Will ye believe a little? Isab. I feare, too much, Sir. Cla. And will ye love a little? Isab. That should be your part. Cla. Thus I begin then, thus and thus. Isab. A good beginning, We have a Proverbe saies, makes a good ending. Cla. Say ye so? 'tis well infer'd. Isab. Good Sir, your patience: Me thinks I have ventur'd now, like a weak Bark Upon a broken billow, that will swallow me, Upon a rough sea of suspitions, Stuck round with ieallous rocks. Pen. within. A hem, a hem there. Isab. This is my man; my feares too soone have found me, Enter Penurio. Now what's the newes? Pen. A pox of yonder old Rigell, The Captaine, the old Captaine. Isab. What old Captaine? Pen. Captaine couragious yonder of the Castle, Captaine dondeigo, old Bartello. Isab. Where is he? Pen. He's comming in: 'Twould vex the Divell, that such an old Potgun as this, That can make no sport, should hinder them that can do it. Isab. I would not have him see the Gentleman For all the world, my credit were undone then. Pen. Shall I fling a pisse-pot on's head as he comes in, And take him into'th Kitchin, there to dry him. Isab. That will not do; and he is so humerous too He will come in. Cla. What is he? Isab. One much troubles me. Pen. And can do nothing, cannot eat. Isab. Your sight now, Out of a driveling dotage he beares to me, May make him tell my husband, and undo me. Cla. What would ye have me do? Isab. But for a while Sir, Step here behind this hanging, presently I'le answer him, and then.â Cla. I will obey ye. Enter Bartello. Bar. Where's my rich Jeweller? I have stones to set. Pen. He is abroad, and sure Sir. Bart. Ther's for your service: Wher's the faire Lady? all alone sweet beauty? Isab. She's never much alone Sir, that's acquainted With such companions as good honest thoughts are. Bar. Ile sit down by thee, and ile kisse thy hand too, And in thine eare sweare by my life I love thee. Isab. Ye are a merry Captaine. Bar. And a mad one, Lady; By th'mas thou hast goodly eyes, excellent eyes, wench, Ye twinkling rogue, look what thy Captain brings thee, Thou must needs love me, love me heartily, Hug me, and love me, hug me close. Isab. Fye Captaine. Bar. Nay, I have strength, and I can straine ye sirrah, And vault into my seat as nimbly, little one. As any of your smooth chinn'd boyes in Florence, I must needs commit a little folly with ye, Ile not be long, a brideling case, and away wench; The hobnaile thy husband's as fitly out o'th way now. Isab. Do you think he keeps a bawdy house? Bar. That's all one. Isab. Or did you ever see that lightnesse in my carriage, That you might promise to your selfâ Bar. Away foole, A good turn's a good turne; I am an honest fellow. Isab. You have a handsome wife, a vertuous Gentlewoman. Bar. They are not for this time o'th yeer. Isab. A Lady, That ever bore that great respect to you, That noble constancy. Bar. That's more then I know. Enter Maid, and Penurio. Maid. O Mistris, ye are undone, my Master's coming. Pen. Coming hard by here. Bar. Plague Consume the Rascall, Shall I make petty-patties of him? Isab. Now what love Sir? Feare of your comming made him jealous first; Your finding here, will make him mad and desperate, And what in that wilde mood he will executeâ Bar. I can think of nothing, I have no wit left me, Certaine my heads a mustard-pot. Isab. I have thought Sir. And if you'l please to put in execution What I conceiveâ Bar. I'le do it, tell it quickly. Isab. Draw your Sword quickly, and go down inrag'd, As if you had pursu'd some foe up hither, And grumble to your self extremely, terribly, But not a word to him, and so passe by him. Bar. Ile do it perfectly. Enter Lopes. Isab. Stand you still good Sir. Bar. Rascall, slave, villaine, take a house so poorely, After thou hast wrong'd a Gentleman, a Souldier, Base Poultroon boy, you will forsake your neast sirrah. Lop. The matter, good sweet Captain? Bart. Run-away rogue, And take a house to cover thy base cowardize, Ile whip ye, Ile so scourge ye. (Exit. Lop. Mercy upon me, What's all this matter wife? Isab. Did you meet the mad man? Lop. I never saw the Captain so provok't yet. Isab. O he's a Devill sure, a most bloody devill, He follow'd a young Gentleman, his sword drawne, With such a fury, how I shake to think on't, And foyn'd, and flash't at him, and swore he'd kill him, Drove him up hither, follow'd him still bloodily, And if I had not hid him, sure had slaine him; A mercilesse old man. Cla. Most vertuous Lady, Even as the giver of my life, I thank ye. Lop. This fellow must not stay here, he is too hansom; He is gone Sir, and you may passe now with all security, Ile be your guide my selfe, and such a way Ile lead ye, none shall crosse, nor none shall know ye. The doore's left open Sirrah, ile starve you for this trick, Ile make thee fast o' Sondayes; and for you Lady, Ile have your lodgings, farther off, and closer, Ile have no street lights to you; will you go Sir? Cla. I thank ye Sir; the Devill take this fortune; And once more all my service to your goodnesse. Exit. Pen. Now could I eat my very arms for madnesse, Cross'd in the nick o'th matter? vengeance take it, And that old Cavalier that spoil'd our Cock-fight; Ile lay the next plot surer. Isab. I am glad and sorry; Glad, that I got so fairely off suspition; Sorry I lost my new lov'd friend. Pen. Not lost Mistris; Ile conjure once againe to raise that spirit; In, and looke soberly upon the matter, Wee'l ring him one peale more, and if that fall, The Devill take the clappers, bells, and all.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Duchesse, Lords, and Rodope, Duch. Now, Rhodope, How do you finde my daughter? Rho. Madam, I finde her now what you would have her, What the State wishes her; I urg'd her fault to her, Open'd her eyes, and made her see the mischiefe She was running with a headlong will into, Made her stait at her folly, shake and tremble, At the meere memory of such an ignorance, She now contemnes his love, hates his remembrance, Cannot endure to heare the name of Silvio; His person spits at. Duch. I am glad to heare this. Rho. And humbly now to your will, your care, Madam, Bends her affections, bowes her best obedience; Syennas Duke, with new eyes now she looks on, And with a Princely love, fit for his person, Returnes that happinesse and joy he look't for; The generall good of both the neighbour Dukedoms, Not any private end, or rash affection She aims at now: hearing the Duke ariv'd too, (To whom she owes all honour, and all service,) She charg'd me kneele thus at your Graces feet, And not to rise without a generall pardon.

She has it, and my love againe, my old love, And with more tendernesse I meet this penitence, Then if she ne're had started from her honour; I thank ye Rhodope, am bound to thank ye, And dayly to remember this great service, This honest faithfull service; go in peace, And by this Ring, delivered to Bartello, Let her enjoy our favour, and her liberty, And presently to this place, with all honour, See her conducted. Rho. Your Grace has made me happy. Exit. Enter 1 Lord. 1 Lord. Syennas noble Duke, craves his admittance. Enter Duke of Syenna with Attendants. Duch. Go, wait upon his Grace; fair Sir, you are welcome, Welcome to her ever admir'd your vertues: And now, me thinks, my Court looks true nobly; You have taken too much pains, Sir. Syen. Royall Lady, To wait upon your Grace is but my service. Duch. Keep that Sir, for the Saint ye have vow'd it to. Syen. I keep a life for her: Since your Grace pleases To jump so happily into the matter, I come indeed to claime your royall promise, The beauteous Belvidere in marriage, I come to tender her my youth, my fortune, My everlasting love. Enter Belvidere, Bartello, Rhodope, attendance. Duch. You are like to win Sir: All is forgot, forgiven too; no sadnesse My good Childe, you have the same heart still here, The Duke of Syenna, Childe, pray use him nobly. Sy. An Angell beauty. Bel. Your Grace is fairely welcome, And what in modesty a blushing maid may Wish to a Gentleman of your great goodnesse; But wishes are too poore a pay for Princes. Sy. You have made me richer then all States and Titles, One kisse of this white hand's above all honours, My faith deare Lady, and my fruitfull service, My duteous zealeâ Bel. Your Grace is a great Master, And speake too powerfully to be resisted: Once more you are welcome Sir, to me you are welcome, To her that honoures ye; I could say more Sir, But in anothers tongue 'twere better spoken, Sy. As wife as faire, you have made your Servant happy; I never saw so rich a Mine of sweetnesse. Duch. Will your Grace please, after your painfull journy To take some rest? Are the Dukes Lodgings ready? Lord. All Madam. Duch. Then wait upon his Grace, all, and to morrow Sir We'l shew ye in what high esteeme we hold ye, Till then a faire repose. Sy. My fairest service Exit Duke, &amp;c. Duch. You have so honour'd me, my dearest Daughter, So truly pleas'd me in this entertainment, I meane your loving carriage to Syenna, That both for ever I forget all trespasses, And to secure you next of my full favour, Aske what you will within my power to grant ye, Aske freely: and if I forget my promiseâ Aske confidently. Bel. You are too royall to me, To me that have so foolishly transgress'd you, So like a Girle, so far forgot my vertue, Which now appeares as base and ugly to me, As did his Dream, that thought he was in Paradice, Awak'd and saw the Devill; how was I wander'd? With what eyes could I look upon that poore, that course thing, That wretched thing call'd Silvio? that (now) despis'd thing? And lose an object of that gracefull sweetnesse; That god-like presence as Syenna is? Darknesse, and cheerfull day had not such difference: But I must ever blesse your care, your wisedome, That led me from this labirinth of folly, How had I sunk else? what example given? Duch. Prethee no more, and as thou art my best one, Aske something that may equall such a goodnesse. Bel. Why did ye let him go so slightly from ye, More like a man in triumph, then condemn'd? Why did ye make his pennance but a question, A riddle, every idle wit unlocks. Duch. 'Tis not so, Nor do not feare it so: he will not finde it, I have given that (unlesse my selfe discover it) Will cost his head. Bel. 'Tis subject to construction? Duch. That it is too. Bel. It may be then absolv'd, And then are we both scorn'd and laugh'd at, Madam; Beside the promise you have ty'd upon it, Which you must never keepe. Duch. I never meant it. Bel. For heaven sake let me know it, 'tis my Suit to ye, The Boone you would have me aske; let me but see it, That if there be a way to make't so strong, No wit nor powerfull reason can run through it, For my disgrace, I may beg of heaven to grant it. Duch. Feare not, it has been put to sharper judgements Then ere he shall arrive at: my deare Father, That was as fiery in his understanding, And ready in his wit as any living, Had it two yeares, and studied it, yet lost it: This night ye are my Bed-fellow, there Daughter Into your bosome ile commit this secret, And there we'l both take counsell. Bel. I shall finde Some trick I hope too strong yet for his minde. Exeunt. Scena Secunda. Enter Penurio. Pen. Methinks I am batten'd well of late, growne lusty, Fat, high, and kicking, thankes to the bounteous Rugio; And now, methinkes I scorne these poore repasts, Cheese parings, and the stinking tongues of Pilchers; But why should I remember these? they are odious, They are odious in mine eyes; the full fat dish now, The bearing dish is that I reverence, The dish an able Serving-man sweats under, And bends ith' hams, as if the house hung on him, That dish is the dish: hang your bladder Bankets, Or halfe a dozen of Turnop, and two Mushrumps, These when they breed their best, hatch but two Belches; The state of a fat Turkey, the decorum He marches in with, all the traine and circumstance; 'Tis such a matter, such a glorious matter, And then his sauce, with Orenges and Onions, And he display'd in all parts, for such a dish now, And at my need I would betray my father, And for a roasted Conger, all my Country. Enter Bartello. Bar. What my friend Lean-gut, how do's thy beauteous Mistris? And where's your Master Sirra? where's that horn-pipe? Pen. My Mistris Sir, do's as a poore wrong'd Gentlewoman, Too much heaven knows opprest with injuries, May do and live. Bar. Is the old foole still jealous? Pen. As old fooles are, and will be still the same Sir. Bar. He must have cause: he must have cause. Pen. 'Tis true Sir, And would he had with all my heart. Bar. He shall have. Pen. For then he had Salt to his Saffron Porredge. Bar. Why do not I see thee sometime? why thou starv'd rascal? Why do not ye come to me, you precius bow-case? I keepe good meat at home, good store: Pen. Yes Sir, I will not faile ye all next weeke. Bar. Thou art welcome, I have a secret I would faine impart to thee, But thou art so thin the wind will blow it from thee, Or men will read it through thee. Pen. Wrapt up in beefe Sir, In good grosse beefe, let all the world looke on me, The English have that trick to keep intelligence. Bar. A witty knave, first there's to tye your tongue up, Pen. Dumbe as a Dog Sir. Bar. Next, hark in your eare, Sirra. Pen. Well, very well, excellent well: 'tis done Sir, Say no more to me. Bar. Say and hold. Pen. 'Tis done Sir. Bar. As thou lov'st butter'd eggs, sweare. Pen. Let me kisse the Booke first, But here's my hand, brave Captaine. Bar. Looke ye hold, sirra. Exit. Pen. O the most precious vanity of this world When such dry Neats-tongues must be sok'd and larded With young fat supple wenches? O the Devill, What can he do, he cannot suck an egge off But his back's loose ith' hilts; go thy wales Captaine, Well may thy Warlike name work Miracles, But if e're thy founder'd courser win match more, Or stand right but one traineâ Enter three Gentlemen. 1. Gent. Now Signiour Shadow, What art thou thinking of, how to rob thy Master? Pen. Of his good deeds? the Thief that undertakes that Must have a hook will poze all Hell to hammer: Have ye dined Gentlemen, or do you purpose? 2 Gent. Dined, two long houres ago. Pen. Pray ye take me with ye. 3 Gent. To supper do'st thou meane? Pen. To any thing That has the smell of meat in't: tell me true, Gentlemen, Are not you three now going to be sinfull, To jeabard a joynt, or so? I have found your faces, And see whore written in your eyes. 1 Gent. A parlous Rascall, Thou art much upon the matter. Pen. Have a care Gentlemen, 'Tis a sore age, very sore age, lewd age, And women now are like old Knights adventures, Full of inchanted flames, and dangerous. 2 Gent, Where the most danger is, there's most honour. Pen. I grant ye, honour most consists in sufferance, And by that rule you three should be most honourable. 3 Gent. A subtle Rogue: but canst thou tell Penurio Where we might light uponâ Pen. A learned Surgeon? 3 Gent. Pox take ye foole; I meane good wholsome wenches. Pen. 'Faith wholsome women will but spoyle ye too, For you are so us'd to snap-haunces: But take my counsell, Take fat old women, fat, and five and fifty, The Dog-dayes are come in. 2 Gent. Take fat old women? Pen. The fatter and the older, still the better, You do not know the pleasure of an old Dame, A fat old Dame, you do not know the knack on't: They are like our Country grotes, as coole as Christmas, And sure ith' keeles. 1 Gent. Hang him starv'd foole, he mocks us. 3. Gent. Penurio, thou know'st all the hansome wenches? What shall I give thee for a Merchants wife now? Pen. I take no money Gentlemen, that's base, I trade in meat, a Merchants wife will cost ye A glorious Capon, a great shoulder of Mutton, And a Tart as big as a Conjurers circle. 3 Gent. That's cheap enough. 1 Gent. And what a Haberdashers? Pen. Worse meat will serve for her: a great Goose Pye, But you must send it out oth' Country to me, It will not do else: with a peace of Bacon, And if you can a pot of Butter with it. 2 Gent. Now do I ayme at horse-flesh: what a Parsons? Pen. A tithe Pig has no fellow, if I fetch her, If she be Puritane, Plumb-porridge do's it, And a fat loyne of Veale well sawc'd and rosted. 2 Gent. Wee'l meet one night, and thou shalt have all these, O' that condition we may have the wenches, A dainty rascall. Pen. When your stomacks serve ye, (For mine is ever ready) Ile supply ye. 1 Gent. Farewell, and there's to fill thy paunch. Pen. Brave Gentleman. 2 Gent. Hold sirrah, there. Pen. Any young wench ith' Towne Sir. 3 Gent. It shall go round. Exit Gent. Pen. Most honourable Gentlemen, All these are Courtiers, but they are meere Coxcombs, And only for a wench, their purses open, Nor have they so much judgement left to chuse her; If e're they call upon me ile so fit 'em, I have a pack of wry-mouth'd mackrell Ladies, Stinke like a standing ditch, and those deare Damsels; But I forgot my businesse, I thank ye Mounsieurs, I have a thousand whimsies in my braines now. Exit. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter (to a Banket) Duches, Syenna, Lords, Attendants. Duch. Your Grace shall now perceive how much we honor ye And in what deare regard we hold your friendship Will you sit Sir, and grace this homely Banquet? Sy. Madam, to your poor friend you are too magnificent. Duc. To the Dukes health, and all the joyes I wish him, Let no man misse this cup: have we no Musick? Sy. Your noble favours still you heap upon me, But where's my vertuous Mistris, such a Feast, And not her sparkling beauty here to blesse it? Me thinkes it should not be, it shewes not fully. Duch. Young Ladies Sir, are long, and curious In putting on their trims, forget how day goes, And then 'tis their good morrow when they are ready: Go some and call her, and wait upon her hither, Tell her the Duke and I desire her company: I warrant ye, a hundred dressings now She has survey'd, this, and that fashion look'd on, For Ruffs and Gowns; cast this away, these Jewels Suited to these and these knots: o' my life Sir, She feares your curious eye will soone discover else: Why stand ye still, why gape ye on one another? Did I not bid ye go and tell my Daughter? Are ye nayled here? nor stir? nor speake? who am I, And who are you? 1 Lord. Pardon me, gracious Lady, The feare to tell you that you would not hear of Makes us all dumb, the Princesse is gone, Madam. Duch. Gone? whither gone? some wiser fellow answer me. 2 Lord. We sought the Court all over, and beleeve Lady, No newes of where she is, nor how convey'd hence. Duch. It cannot be, it must not be. 1 Lord. 'Tis true Madam, No roome in all the Court but we search'd through it, Her women found her want first, and they cry'd to us. Duch. Gone? stolne away? I am abus'd, dishonour'd. Sy. 'Tis I that am abus'd, 'tis I dishonour'd, Is this your welcome, this your favour to me? To foyst a trick upon me, this trick too, To cheat me of my love? Am I not worthy? Or since I was your Guest, am I growne odious? Duch. Your Grace mistakes me, as I have a life, Sir. Sy. And I another, I will never beare this, Never endure this dor. Duch. But heare me patiently. Sy. Give me my love. Duch. As soone as care can finde her, And all care shall be used. Sy. And all my care too, To be reveng'd; I smell the trick, 'tis too ranke, Fie, how it smells oth' Mother. Duch. You wrong me, Duke. Sy. For this disgrace ten thousand Florentines Shall pay their dearest bloods, and dying curse ye, And so I turne away, your mortall enemy. Exit. Duc. Since ye are so high and hot Sir, ye have half arm'd us, Be carefull of the Towne, of all the Castles, And see supplyes of Souldiers every where, And Musters for the Field, when he invites us, For he shall know 'tis not high words can fright us. My Daughter gone? has she so finely cozen'd me? This is for Silvio's sake sure, O cunning false one; Publish a Proclamation thorough the Dukedome. That whosoe're can bring toth' Court young Silvio, Alive or dead, beside our thankes and favour, Shall have two thousand Duckets for his labour; See it dispatch'd, and sent in haste: O base one. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Quarta. Enter Isabella, and Penurio with a Light. Isab. Was't thou with Rugio? Pen. Yes marry was I closely. Isab. And do's he still remember his poore Mistris? Do's he desire to see me? Pen. Yes, and presently: Puts off all businesse else, lives in that memory, And will be here according to directions. Isab. But where's thy Master? Pen. Where a coxcombe should be, Waiting at Court with his Jewells, Safe for this night I warrant ye. Isab. I am bound to thee. Pen. I would ye were, as close as I could tye ye, Isab. Thou art my best, my truest friend. Pen. I labour, I moyle and toyle for ye: I am your hackney. Isab. If ever I be ableâ Pen. Steale the great Cheese Mistris, Was sent him out oth' Country. Isab. Any thing. Pen. That's meat, 'tis lawfull Mistris: where's the Castle Custard He got at Court? Isab. He has lock't it in's study. Pen. Get a warrant to search for counterfeit gold. Isab. Give me thy Candle, Ile finde a time to be thy carefull Cater. Pen. And many a time Ile finde to be his Cook, And dresse his Calves head to the sweetest sauce Mistris. Isab. To bed Penurio, go, the rest is my charge, Ile keep the Watch out. Pen. Now if you spare himâ Exit. Isab. Peace foole, I hope my Rugio will not faile, 'twould vexe me: Now to my string; so, sure he cannot misse now, And this end to my finger: ile lye downe, For on a suddaine I am wondrous heavy, 'Tis very late too; if he come, and finde this, And pull it, though it be with easie motion I shall soone waken, and as soone be with him. Enter Lopez. Lop. Thou secret friend, how am I bound to love thee, And how to hug thee for thy private service? Thou art the Star all my suspitions saile by, The fixed point my wronged honour turnes to, By thee I shall know all, finde all the subtilties Of devilish women, that torment me daily: Thou art my Conjurer, my Spell, my Spirit, All's hush'd and still, no sound of any stirring, No tread of living thing: the Light is in still, And there's my Wife, how prettily the foole lyes, How sweet, and handsomely, and in her clothes too, Waiting for me upon my life; her fondnesse Would not admit her rest till I came to her: O carefull foole, why am I angry with thee? Why do I think thou hat'st thy loving Husband? I am an Asse, an over-doating Coxcombe, And this sweet soule the mirrour of perfection: How admirable faire and delicate, And how it stirs me, ile sing thy sweets a Requiem, But will not waken thee. Song. O faire sweet face, O eyes celestiall bright, Twin-stars in Heaven that now adorn the night; O fruitfull lips, where Cherries ever grow, And Damask cheeks, where all sweet beauties blow; O thou from head to foot divinely faire, Cupids most cunning Nets made of that haire, And as he weaves himselfe for curious eyes, O me, O me, I am caught my selfe, he cryes: Sweet rest about this sweets and golden sleepe, Soft peacefull thoughts your how'rely watches keepe, Whilst I in wonder sing this sacrifice, To beauty sacred, and those Angell-eyes. Now will I steale a kisse, a deare kisse from her, And suck the Rosie breath of this bright beauty; What a Devill is this? ty'd to her finger too? A string, a damned string to give intelligence O my lov'd key, how truly has't thou serv'd me; Ile follow this: soft, soft, toth' doore it goes, And through toth' other side; a damned string 'tis, I am abus'd, topt, Cuckolded, fooled, jaded, Ridden to death, to madnesse; stay, this helps not: Stay, stay, and now invention help me, Ile sit downe by her, take this from her easily, And thus upon mine owne: Dog, I shall catch ye, With all your cunning Sir: I shall light on ye, I felt it pull sure: yes, but wondrous softly, 'Tis there againe, and harder now, have at ye: Now and thou scap'st, the Devills thy ghostly father. Exit. Isab. Sure 'twas my Husbands voyce: The string is gone to, He has found the trick on't: I am undone, betray'd, And if he meet my friend he perishes, What fortune followes me, what spightfull fortune? Hoa, Jaquenet. Enter Jaquenet. Jaq. Here Mistris, do you call me? Isab. Didst thou heare no noise? Jaq. I heare my Master mad yonder, And sweares, and chafesâ Isab. Dar'st thou do one thing for me? One thing concernes mine honour, all is lost else? Jaq. Name what you will. Isab. It can bring but a beating, Which I will recompence so largelyâ Jaq. Name it. Isab. Sit here, as if thou wert asleep. Jaq. Is that all? Isab. When he comes in, what e're he do unto thee (The worst will be but beating) speak not a word, Not one word as thou lovest me. Jaq. Ile run through it. Isab. Ile carry away the Candle. Exit. Jaq. And I the blowes Mistris. Enter Lopez. Lop. Have you put your light out? I shall stumble to ye, You whore, you cunning whore, I shall catch your rogue to, Has light leggs else: I had so Ferret-claw'd him: O have I found ye? do ye play at dog-sleep still whore? Do you think that can protect ye? yes, I will kill thee, But first ile bring thy friends to view thy villanies, Thy whorish villanies: and first ile beat thee, Beat thee to pin-dust, thou salt whore, thou varlet, Scratch out thine eyes; ile spoile your tempting visage; Are ye so patient? ile put my nayles in deeper, Is it good whoring? whoring ye base rascall? Is it good tempting men with strings to ride ye? So, ile fetch your kindred, and your friends, whore, And such a Justice I will act upon thee. Exit. Enter Isabella. Isab. What is he gone? Jaq. The Devill go with him Mistris, Has harrowed me, plow'd land was ne're so harrowed: I had the most ado to save mine eyes. Isab. Has paid thee, But ile heale all againe with good gold Jaquenet; Has damned nayles. Jaq. They are ten-penny nayles I think Mistris: Ile undertake he shall strike 'em through an inch board. Isab. Go up, and wash thy selfe: take my Pomatum, And now let me alone to end the Tragedy. Joq. You had best beware. Isab. I shall deale stoutly with him, Reach me my book, and see the doore made fast wench, And so good night: now to the matter politick. Lopez knocks within. Lop. within You shall see what she is, what a sweet jewell. Isab. Who's there, what mad-man knocks? is this an hower And in mine husbands absence? Lop. within. Will ye open? You know my voyce ye whore, I am that husband: Do you mark her subtlety? but I have paid her, I have so ferk'd her face: here's the blood Gentlemen, Ecce signum: I have spoyl'd her Goatish beauty, Observe her how she lookes now, how she is painted, O 'tis the most wicked'st whore, and the most treacherousâ Enter Lopez, Bartello, Gent. and two Gentlewomen. Gent. Here walkes my Cousen full of meditation, Arm'd with religious thoughts. Bar. Is this the monster? 1 Gentlew. Is this the subject of that rage you talk't of, That naughty woman you had pull'd a peeces? Bar. Here's no such thing. 1. Gentlew. How have ye wrong'd this beauty? Are not you mad my friend? what time o'th Moon is't? Have not you Maggots in your braines? Lop. 'Tis she sure. Gent. Where's the scratch'd face ye spoke of, the torne garments, And all the haire pluck'd off her head? Bar. Beleeve me, 'Twere better far you had lost your paire of pibbles, Then she the least adornment of that sweetnesse. Lop. Is not this blood? 1 Gentlew. This is a monstrous folly, A base abuse. Isab. Thus he do's ever use me, And stickes me up a wonder, not a woman, Nothing I do but subject to suspition; Nothing I can do able to content him. Bar. Lopez, you must not use this. 2 Gentlew. 'Twere not amisse Sir, To give ye sauce to your meat, and suddainly. 1 Gentlew. You that dare wrong a woman of her goodnesse, Thou have a wife, thou have a Beare ty'd to thee, To scratch thy jealous itch, were all o' my minde, I meane all women, we would soone disburthen ye Of that that breeds these fits, these dog-flawes in ye, A Sow-guelder should trim ye. Bar. A rare cure Lady, And one as fit for him as a Thief for a halter, You see this youth: will you not cry him quittance, Body' me, I would pine, but I would pepper him, Ile come anon, he, hang him, poore pompillion: How like a wench bepist he lookes, ile come Lady: Lopez, the Law must teach ye what a wife is, A good, a vertuous wife. Isab. Ile ne're live with him, I crave your loves all to make knowne my cause, That so a faire Divorce may passe between us, I am weary of my life: in danger hourely. Bar. You see how rude you are, I will not misse ye, Unsufferable rude: ile pay him soundly, You should be whipt in Bedlam: ile reward him. 2 Gentlew. Whipping's too good. Lop. I think I am alive still, And in my wits. Bar. Ile put a trick upon him, And get his goods Confiscate: you shall have 'em; I will not faile at nine. Lop. I think I am here too, And once I would have sworn I had taken her napping, I think my name is Lopez. Gent. Fie for shame Sir, You see you have abus'd her, foulely wrong'd her, Hung scandalous and course opinions on her, Which now you finde but children of suspition: Aske her forgivenesse, shew a penitence, She is my Kins-woman, and what she suffers Under so base and beastly jealousies, I will redresse else, ile seeke satisfaction. Bar. Why, every Boy ith' Towne will pisse upon thee. Lop. I am sorry for't. 1 Gentlew. Downe o' your marrow-bones. Lop. Even sorry from my heart: forgive me sweet wife, Here I confesse most freely I have wrong'd ye, As freely here I beg a pardon of ye, From this hower no debate, no crosse suspitionâ Isab. To shew ye Sir I understand a wives part, Thus I assure my love, and seale your pardon. 2 Gentlew. 'Tis well done, now to bed and there confirm it. Gent. And so good night. Bar. Aware relapses, Lopez. Exeunt. Lop. Now Isabella tell me truth, and suddainly, And do not juggle with me, nor dissemble, For as I have a life ye dye then: I am not mad, Nor do's the Devill work upon my weaknesse, Tell me the trick of this, and tell me freely. Isab. Will then that satisfie ye? Lop. If ye deale ingenuously. Isab. Ile tell ye all, and tell ye true and freely, Bartello was the end of all this jealousie, His often visitations brought by you, first Bred all these fits, and these suspitions: I knew your false key, and accordingly I fram'd my plot, to have him take him finely, Too poore a pennance for the wrong his wife beares, His worthy vertuous wife: I felt it sensibly When ye tooke off the string, and was much pleas'd in't, Because I wish'd his importunate dotage paid well, And had you staid two minutes more, ye had had him. Lop. This sounds like truth. Isab. Because this shall be certaine, Next time he comes, as long he cannot tarry, Your self shall see, and heare, his lew'd temptations. Lop. Till then I am satisfied, and if this prove true, Henceforward Mistris of your self I give ye, And I to serve ye: For my lusty Captaine, Ile make him daunce, and make him think the Devill Clawes at his breech, and yet I will not hurt him: Come now to bed, and prove but constant this way, Ile prove the man you ever wished. Isab. You have blest me. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Silvio. Sil. What labour and what travell have I runne Through? And through what Cities to absolve this Riddle? Diviners, Dreamers, Schoolemen, deep Magitians, All have I tride, and all give severall meanings, And from all hope of any future happinesse, To this place am I come at length, the country, The people simple, plaine, and harmlesse witty, Whose honest labours Heaven rewards with plenty Of Corne, Wine, Oyle, which they againe, as thankfull, To their new Cropps, new pastimes celebrate, And crowne their joyfull harvests with new voyces; By a rich farmer here I am entertain'd, And rank't among the number of his Servants, Not guessing what I am, but what he would have me, Here may be so much wit (though much I feare it) To undo this knotty question; and would to Heaven Enter Soto with a Proclamation. My fortunes had been hatch'd with theirs, as innocent, And never knowne a pitch above their plainnesse. Soto. That it is, that it is, what's this word now? this Is a plaguy word, that it is, r. e. a. that it is, reason, By your leave, Mr. Soto, by your leave, you are too quick, Sir, Ther's a strange par'lous T. hefore the reason, A very tall T. which makes the word High Treason. Sil. What Treason's that? do's this fellow understand Himselfe? Soto. Pitch will infect, ile meddle no more with this geere; What a Devill ayles this fellow? this foolish fellow, Being admitted to be one of us too, That are the masters of the Sports proceeding, Thus to appeare, before me too, unmorriss'd? Do you know me friend? Sil. You are my Masters Son, Sir. Soto. And do you know what sports are now in season? Sil. I heare there are some a foot. Soto. Where are your Bells then? Your Rings, your Ribanes, friend? &amp; your clean Napkins? Your nosegay in your hat, pinn'd up, am not I here? My fathers eldest Son, and at this time, Sir, I would have ye know it, though ye be ten times his servant, A better man then my father far, Lord of this Harvest, Sir, And shall a man of my place want attendance? Sil. 'Twas want of knowledge, Sir, not duty, bred this, I would have made suit else for your Lordships service. Soto. In some sort I am satisfied now, mend your maners, But thou art a melancholly fellow, veng'ance melancholly, And that may breed a insurrection amongst us; Go too, Ile lay the best part of two pots now Thou art in love, and I can guesse with whom too, I saw the wench that twir'd and twinkled at thee, The other day; the wench that's new come hither, The young smug wench. Sil. You know more then I feele Sir. Soto. Go too, Ile be thy friend, ile speak a good word for thee, And thou shalt have my Lordships countenance to her; May be I have had a snap my self, may be I, may be no, We Lords are allow'd a little more. Sil. 'Tis fit Sir; I humbly thank ye, you are too too tender of me, But what Sir, I beseech ye, was that paper, Your Lordship was so studiously imployed in, When ye came out a doores? Soto. Thou meanest this paper. Sil. That Sir, I think. Soto. Why, 'tis a Proclamation, A notable piece of villany, as ever thou heard'st in thy life, By mine honour it is. Sil. How Sir? or what concernes it? Soto. It comes ye from the Duchesse, a plaguy wise woman, To apprehend the body of one Silvio, As arrant a Rascall as ever pist against post, And this same Silvio, or this foresaid rascall, To bring before her, live or dead; for which good service The man that brings him, has two thousand Duckets; Is not this notable matter now? Sil. 'Tis so indeed, This Proclamation beares my bane about it; Can no rest finde me? no private place secure me? But still my miseries like blood-hounds haunt me? Unfortunate young man, which way now guides thee, Guides thee from death? the Countrey's laid round for thee; O Claudio, now I feele thy blood upon me, Now it speaks lowdly here, I am sure against me, Time now has found it out, and truth proclam'd it, And Justice now cries out, I must die for it. Soto. Hast thou read it? Sil. Yes. Soto. And dost thou know that Silvio. Sil. I never saw him, Sir. Soto. I have, and know him too, I know him as well as I know thee, and better, And if I light upon him, for a trick he plaid me once, A certaine kinde of dog-trick, ile so fiddle him, Two thousand Duckets, ile so pepper him, And with that money ile turne Gentleman, Worth a browne Bakers dozen of such Silvio's. Sil. There is no staying here, this rogue will know me, And for the money sake betray me too; I must bethink me suddenly and safely. Enter Morrisdancers. Soto. Mine owne deare Lady, have at thy honey-comb, Now, for the honour of our Towne, Boyes, trace sweetly, Cry within of Arme, Arme. What a vengeance ayles this whobub? pox refuse 'em, Cannot they let us dance in our owne defence here? Enter Farmer and Captaine. Capt. Arme, honest friends, arme suddenly &amp; bravely And with your antient resolutions follow me; Look how the Beacons show like comets, your poor neighbours Run maddingly affrighted through the Villages; Syennas Duke is up, burnes all before him, And with his sword, makes thousand mothers childlesse, Soto. What's this to our Morrisdancers? Sil. This may serve my turne. Soto. Theres ne're a Duke in Christendome but loves a May-game. Cap. At a Horse you were alwaies ceaz'd, put your Son on him, And arme him well i'th States name, I command ye; And they that dare go voluntary, shall receive reward. Soto. I dare go no way, Sir, this is strange, Master Captaine, You cannot be content to spoile our sport here, Which I do not think your Worship's able to answer, But you must set us together by the ears, with I know not who to? We are for the bodily part o'th dance. Cap. Arme him suddenly, This is no time to foole, I shall returne ye else, A rebell to the Generall, State, and Duchesse, And how you'l answer thenâ Far. I have no more Sons, Sir, This is my onely boy; I beseech ye Master Captain. Soto. I am a rank coward too, to say the truth, Sir, I never had good luck at buffets neither. Far. Here's vorty shillings, spare the childe. Cap. I cannot. Soto. Are ye a man? will ye cast away a May-Lord? Shall all the wenches in the Country curse ye? Sil. An't please you Captaine, ile supply his person, 'Tis pitty their old custome should be frighted, Let me have Horse, and good Armes, ile serve willingly, And if I shrink a foot of ground, Hell take me. Cap. A promising aspect, face full of courage, Ile take this man, and thank ye too. Far. Ther's for thee, 'Tis in a clout, but good old gold. Sil. I thank ye Sir. Far. Goe saddle my fore-horse, put his feather on too, Hee'l praunce it bravely, friend, he feares no Colours, And take the Armour down, and see him dizin'd, Soto. Farewell, &amp; if thou carriest thy self well in this matter, I say no more, but this, there must be more May-Lords, And I know who are fit. Sil. Dance you, Ile fight, Sir, Cap. Away, away. Sil. Farewell, I am for the Captaine. Exit. Far. Now to this matter againe, my honest fellowes, For if this go not forward, I foresee friends, This war will fright our neighbours out o'th villages; Cheere up your hearts, we shall heare better news, boyes. Hob. Surely, I will daunce no more, 'tis most ridiculous, I finde my wives instructions now meere verities, My learned wives, she often hath pronounc'd to me My safety Bomby, defie these sports, thou art damn'd else, This Beast of Babylon, I will never back againe, His pace is sure prophane, and his lewd wihies The Sons of Hymyn, and Gymyn, in the wildernesse. Far. Fie neighbour Bomby, in your fits againe, Your zeale swets, this is not carefull, neighbour, The Hobby-Horse, is a seemely Hobby-Horse. Soto. And as pretty a Beast on's inches, though I say it. Hob. The Beast is an unseemely, and a lew'd Beast, And got at Rome by the Popes Coach-Horses, His mother was the Mare of ignorance. Soto. Cobler, thou lyest, and thou wert a thousand Coblers, His mother was an honest Mare, &amp; a Mare of good credit, I know the Mare, and if need be, can bring witnesse; And in the way of honesty I tell thee, Scorn'd any Coach-Horse the Pope had, thou art foolish, And thy blind zeale makes thee abuse the Beast. Hob. I do defie thee, and thy foot-cloth too, And tell thee to thy face, this prophaine riding I feele it in my conscience, and I dare speake it, This unedified ambling, hath brought a scourge upon us, This Hobby-horse sincerity we liv'd in War, and the sword of slaughter: I renounce it, And put the Beast off; thus, the Beast poluted, And now no more shall hope on high Bomby, Follow the painted Pipes of worldly pleasures, And with the wicked daunce the Devills measures; Away thou pamper'd jade of vanity, Stand at the Livery of lewd delights now, And eat the provender of prickear'd folly, My daunce shall be to the pipe of persecution. Far. Will you daunce no more Neighbour? Hob. Surely no, Carry the Beast to his Crib: I have renounc'd him, And all his workes. Soto. Shall the Hobby-horse be forgot then? The hopefull Hobby-horse? shall he lye founder'd? If thou do'st this, thou art but a cast-away Cobler: My anger's up, think wisely, and think quickly, And look upon the quondam beast of pleasure, If thou dost this (mark me, thou serious Sowter) Thou Bench-whistler of the old tribe of toe-peeces, If thou do'st this there shall be no more Shooe-mending, Every man shall have a speciall care of his owne soule: And, in his pocket carry his two Confessors, His Yugell, and his Nawle: if thou do'st thisâ Far. He will dance againe for certaine. Hob. I cry out on't, 'Twas the fore-running sin brought in those Tilt-staves, They brandish 'gainst the Church, the Devill calls Maypoles, Take up your Horse againe, and girth him to ye, And girth him handsomely good neighbour Bomby. Hob. I spit at him. Soto. Spit in the Horse face, Cobler? Thou out of tune-Psalm-singing Slave; spit in his visnomy? Hob. I spit againe, and thus I rise against him: Against this Beast: that signifi'd destruction, Fore-shew'd ith' falls of Monarchies. Soto. Ith' face of him? Spit such another spit, by this hand Cobler Ile make ye set a new peece o' your nose there, 'Tak't up I say, and dance without more bidding, And dance as you were wont: you have been excellent And art still, but for this new nicity, And your wives learned Lectures: take up the Hobby-horse Come, 'tis a thing thou hast lov'd with all thy heart Bomby And would'st do still but for the round-breecht Brothers: You were not thus in the morning, tak't up I say, Do not delay but do it: you know I am officer, And I know 'tis unfit all these good fellowes Should wait the cooling of your zealous porridge; Chuse whether you will dance, or have me execute: Ile clap your neek ith' Stocks, and there ile make ye Dance a whole day, and dance with these at night too, You mend old Shooes well, mend your old manners better, And suddenly see you leave off this sincerenesse. This new hot batch borrowed from some brown Baker, Some learned Brother, or ile so bait ye for't, Take it quickly up. Hob. I take my persecution, And thus I am forced a by-word to my Brethren. Soto. Strike up, strike up: strike merrily. Far. To it roundly, Now to the harvest feast: then sport againe Boyes. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter Silvio (arm'd.) Sil. What shall I do? live thus unknown, and base still? Or thrust my self into the head oth' Battell? And there, like that I am, a Gentleman, And one that never fear'd the face of danger, (So in her angry eyes she carried honour) Fight nobly, and (to end my cares) dye nobly? Song within. Silvio go on, and raise thy noble minde To noble ends; fling course base thoughts behinde: Silvio, thou Sonne of everliving fame, Now aime at vertue, and a Noble Name. Silvio consider, Honour is not wonne, Nor vertue reach't, till some brave thing be done: Thy Country calls thee now; she burnes, and bleeds, Now raise thy self, young man, to noble deeds. Into the Battell Silvio, there seeke forth Danger, and blood, by them stands sacred worth. What heavenly voice is this that followes me? This is the second time 't has waited on me, Since I was arm'd, and ready for the Battell; It names me often, steeles my heart with courage, Enter Belvidere deformed. And in a thousand and sweet noates comforts me; What Beldom's this? how old she is, and ugly, Why do's she follow me? Bel. Be not dismaid, Son, I wait upon thee, for thy good, and honour, 'Twas I that now sung to thee, stir'd thy minde up, And rais'd thy spirits to the pitch of noblenesse. Sil. Though she be old, and of a crooked carkasse, Her voice is like the harmony of Angels. Bel. Thou art my darling, all my love dwells on thee The Son of vertue, therefore I attend thee; Enquire not what I am, I come to serve thee, For if thou beest inquisitive, thou hast lost me: A thousand long miles hence my dwelling is, Deep in a Cave, where but mine owne, no foot treads, There by mine Art, I found what danger (Silvio) And deep distresse of heart, thou wert growne into, A thousand leagues I have cut through empty aire, Far swifter then the sayling tack that gallops Upon the wings of angry winds, to seeke thee. Sometimes 'ore a swelling tide, on a Dolphins back I ride, Sometimes passe the earth below, and through the unmoved Center go; Sometimes in a flame of fire, like a Meteor I aspire, Sometimes in mine owne shape, thus, when I helpe the vertuous, Men of honourable minds, command my Art in all his kinds; Pursue the noble thought of war, from thy Guard ile not be far, Get thee worship on thy foe, lasting fame is gotten so. Single Syennas Duke alone, heare thy friends, thy Country grone, And with thy manly arme strike sure, then thou hast wrought thine owne free cure. Sil. Some Sybell sure, some soule heaven loves, and favours. And lends her their free powers, to worke their wonders? How she incites my courage? Bel. Silvio, I knew thee many daies a go, Foresaw thy love to Belvidere, the Duchesse Daughter, and her Heire; Knew she lov'd thee, and know what past, when you were found i'th Castle fast In one anothers armes; foresaw the taking of ye, and the Law; And so thy innocence I loved, the deepest of my skill I proved; Be rul'd by me, for to this houre I have dwelt about thee with my powre. Sil. I will, and in the course of all observe thee, For thou art sure an Angell good sent to me. Bel. Get thee gone then to the fight, longer stay but robs thy right; When thou grow'st weary ile be neere, then think on beauteous Belvidere, For every precious thought of her, ile lend thine honour a new spurre; When all is done, meet here at night; Go and be happy in the fight. Exit. Sil. I certainly believe I shall do nobly, And that Ile bravely reach at too, or die. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Claudio, and Penurio. Cla. Is she so loving still? Pen. She is mad with love, As mad as ever unworm'd dogge was, Signior, And do's so weep, and curse, for your prevention, Your crosses in your love; it frets me too, I am falne away to nothing, to a spindle, Growne a meere man of mat, no soule within me, Pox o' my Master, Sir, will that content ye? Cla. This rogue but cozens me, and she neglects me, Upon my life there are some other gamsters, Neerer the winde then I, and that prevents me, Is there no other holds acquaintance with her? Prethee be true, be honest, do not mock me, Thou knowest her heart, no former interest She has vow'd a favour to? and cannot handsomly Go off, but by regaining such a friendship? There are a thousand handsom men, young, wealthy, That will not stick at any rate, nor danger, To gaine so sweet a prize; nor can I blame her, If where she finds a comfort she deale cunningly, I am a stranger yet. Pen. Ye are all she looks for, And if there be any other, she neglects all, And all for you: I would you saw how grievously And with what hourely lamentations. Cla. I know thou flatter'st me; tell me but truth, Looke here, look well, the best meat in the Dukedom, The rarest, and the choicest of all diets, This will I give thee, but to satisfie me; That is, not to dissemble; this rare Lobster, This Pheasant of the sea, this dish for Princes, And all this thou shalt enjoy, eat all thy selfe, Have good Greeke wine, or any thing belongs to it, A wench if it desire one. Pen. All this, Signior? Cla. All, and a greater far then this. Pen. A greater? Cla. If thou deserve by telling truth. Pen. A wench too? Cla. Or any thing, but if you play the knave now, The Cozening knave besides the losse of this, In which thou hast parted with a paradise, I neare will give thee meat more, not a morsell, No smell of meat by my meanes shall come neere thee, Nor name of any thing that's nourishing, But to thy old part Tantalus againe, Thou shalt returne, and there snap at a shadow. Pen. Upon this point, had I intended Treason, Or any thing might call my life in question, Follow'd with all the tortures time could think on, Give me but time to eat this lovely Lobster, This Alderman o'th Sea, and give me wine to him, I would reveale all, and if that all were too little, More then I knew; Bartello holds in with her, The Captain of the Cittadell, but you need not fear him, His tongue's the stiffest weapon that he carries. He is old, and out of use; there are some other, Men young enough, handsome, and bold enough, Could they come to make their game once; but they want Sir, They want the unde quare, they are laid by then, Enter Bartello. You onely are the man shall knock the nayle inâ Bar. How now Penurio? Pen. Your Worship's fairely met, Sir. You shall heare further from me, steale aside Sir. Cla. Remember your Master for those Chaines. Pen. They are ready, Sir. Bart. What young thing's this? by his habit hee's a Merchant; I feare he trades my way too, you dryed dog-fish, What bait was that? Pen. Who Sir, the thing went hence now? A notable young whelp. Bart. To what end Sirrah? Pen. Came to buy Chaines and Rings, is to be married, An Asse, a Coxcomb, has nothing in his house, Sir; I warrant you think he came to see my Mistris? Bart. I doubt it shrewdly. Pen. Away, away, 'tis foolish; He has not the face to look upon a Gentlewoman, A poore skym'd thing, his Mothers maids are faine, Sir, To teach him how to kisse, and against he is married, To shew him on which side the stirrop stands. Bart. That's a fine youth. Pen. Thou wouldst hang thy self, that thou hadst half his power, Thou empty Potgun. Bart. Am I come fit Penurio? Pen. As fit as a fiddle, My Master's now abroad about his businesse. Bart. When thou cam'st to me home to day, I half suspected My wife was jealous, that she whispered to thee. Pen. You deserve well the whil'st, ther's no such matter, She talk'd about some toyes my Master must bring to her, You must not know of. Bart. Ile take noat, Penurio. Pen. No, Nor you shall not, till you have it soundly. This is the bravest Capitano Pompo, Enter Isabella. But I shall pump ye anon Sir. Isab. O my Bartello? Bart. Ye pretty Rogue, you little Rogue, you sweet Rogue, Away Penurio, go and walk i'th Horse-Fayre. Isab. You do not love me? Bart. Thou lyest thou little Rascall; There Sirrah, to your Centry. Pen. How the Colt itches? Ile help ye to a Curry-comb shall claw ye. Exit. Isab. And how much dost thou love me? Bart. Let's go in quickly, Ile tell thee presently, ile measure it to thee. Isab. No busses first? sit 'o my knee, my brave boy, My valiant boy; do not look so fiercely on me. Thou wilt fright me with thy face; come busse againe Chick, Smile in my face you mad thing. Bart. I am mad in deed wench, Precious I am all o' fire. Isab. Ile warrant thee better. Bar. Ile warme thee too, or ile blow out my bellowes; Ha, ye sweet rogue, you loving rogue, a Boy now, A Souldier I will get shall prove a fellow. Enter Jaquenet and Penurio. Jaq. Mistris, looke to your selfe, my Master's comming. Bar. The Devill come, and go with him. Pen. The Devill's come indeed, he brings your wife, Sir. Isab. We are undone, undone then. Bar. My wife with him? Why this is a dismall day. Pen. They are hard by too, Sir. Bar. I must not, dare not see her. Isab. Nor my Husband, For twenty thousand pound. Bar. That I were a Cat now, Or any thing could run into a Bench-hole, Saint Anthonies Fire upon the Rogue has brought her; Where shall I be? just in the nick oth' matter? When I had her at my mercy: think for heaven sake, My wife, all the wilde furies hell has. Pen. Up the Chimney. Bar. They'l smoke me out there presently. Isab. There, there, it must be there, We are all undone else: it must be up the Chimney. Bar. Give me a Ladder. Isab. You must use your Art Sir, Alas, we have no Ladders. Bar. Pox o' thy husband, Do's he never mend his house? Pen. No, nor himselfe neither: Up nimbly Sir, up nimbly. Bar. Thou know'st I am fat, Thou mercilesse leane Rogue. Pen. Will ye be kill'd? For if he take yeâ Bar. Lend me thy shoulder. Pen. Soft Sir, You'l tread my shoulder-bones into my sides else, Have ye fast hold oth' barrs? Bar. A vengeance bar 'em. Isab. Patience good Captain, patience: quickly, quickly. Bar. Do you think I am made of smoke? Pen. Now he talkes of smoke, What if my Master should call for fire? Bar. Will ye Martyr me? Isab. He must needs have it. Bar. Will ye make me Bacon? Isab. We'l do the best we can, are all things ready? Pen. All, all, I have 'em all. Bar. Go, let 'em in then, Not a word now on your life. Bar. I hang like a Meteor. Enter Lopez and Rodope. Lop. You are welcome Lady. Rho. You are too too curteous, But I shall make amends, faire Isabella. Isab. Welcome my worthy friend, most kindely welcome. Rho. I heare on't, and ile fit him for his foolery. Lop. Some sweet meats wife: some sweet meats presently. Bart. O my sowre sauce. Lop. Away quick Isabella. Exit Isab. Did you heare him? Rho. Yes, yes, perfectly, proceed Sir. Lop. Speake loud enough: Dare ye at length but pitty me? Rho. 'Faith Sir, you have us'd so many reasons to me, And those so powerfullyâ Lop. Keep this kisse for me. Bar. And do I stand and heare this? Rho. This for me Sir, This is some comfort now: Alas my Husbandâ But why Do I think of so poore a fellow, So wretched, so debosh'd? Bar. That's I, I am bound to heare it. Rho. I dare not lye with him, he is so ranke a Whoremaster. Lop. And that's a dangerous point. Rho. Upon my conscience Sir, He would stick a thousand base diseases on me. Bar. And now must I say nothing. Lop. I am sound Lady. Rho. That's it that makes me love ye. Lop. Let's kisse againe then. Rho. Do, do. Bar. Do, the Devill And the grand Pox do with ye. Lop. Do ye heare him? wellâ Enter Penurio and Isabella. Now, what's the newes with you? Pen. The sound of War Sir, Comes still along: The Duke will charge the City, We have lost they say. Lop. What shall become of me then, And my poore wealth? Bar. Even hang'd, I hope. Rho. Remove your Jewells presently, And what you have of wealth into the Cittadell, There all's secure. Lop. I humbly thank ye Lady: Penurio, get me some can climbe the Chimney, For there my Jewells are, my best, my richest, I hid 'em, fearing such a blow. Pen. Most happily: I have two Boyes, that use to sweep fould Chimnies, Truly I bought 'em Sir, to mock your worship, For the great Fires ye keep, and the full diet. Lop.

Exe. ScÃ¦na Quarta. Enter Silvio, and Belvidere severally. Sil. Haile reverent Dame, heaven wait upon thy studies. Bel. You are well met Son: what is the Battell ended? Sil. Mother, 'tis done. Bel. How has thy honour prosper'd? Sil. The Dutchesse has the day, Syenna's Prisoner: Arm'd with thy powerfull Art, this arme dismounted him, Receiv'd him then on foot, and in faire valour Forc'd him mine owne, this Iewell I tooke from him, It hung upon his cask, the Victors triumph: And to the Dutchesse now a Prisoner I have renderd him: Come off againe unknown, Mother. Bel. 'Tis well done, let me see the jewell Son; 'Tis a rich one, curious set, fit a Princesse Burgonet: This rich token late was sent, by the Dutchesse with intent The Marriage next day to begin: Do'st thou know what's hid within? Wipe thine eyes, and then come neere, see the beautious Belvidere: Now behold it. Sil. O my Saint. Bel. Weare it nobly, do not faint. Sil. How blest am I in this rich spoile, this picture, For ever will I keep it here, here Mother, For ever honour it: how oft, how chastly Have I embrac'd the life of this, and kist it? Bel. The day drawes on that thou must home returne, And make thy answer to the Dutchesse question I know it troubles thee, for if thou faile in'tâ Sil. O, I must dye. Bel. Feare not, feare not, ile be nigh, Cast thy trouble on my back, art nor cunning shall not lack To preserve thee, still to keepe, what thy envious foemen seeke; Go boldly home, and let thy minde, no distrustfull crosses finde: All shall happen for the best; souls walk through sorrowes that are blest. Sil. Then I go confident. Bel. But first my Son, a thankfull service must be done, The good old woman for her paine, when every thing stands faire againe, Must ask a poore Boon, and that granting, there's nothing to thy journey wanting. Sil. Except the triall of my soul to mischief, And as I am a Knight, and love mine honour, I grant it whatsoever. Bel. Thy pure soule Shall never sinke for me, nor howle. Sil. Then any thing. Bel. When I shall aske remember. Sil. If I forget, heavens goodnesse forget me. Bel. On thy journey then a while, to the next crosse way and stile Ile conduct thee, keepe thee true, to thy Mistris and thy vow, And let all their envies fall, ile be with thee and quench all.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Duchesse, Syenna, and Lords, Sy. Lady, the stubborn war's more milde then you are, That allowes Ransome, and the Prisoner takenâ Duch. We must not be too hasty: Remember Sir, The wrong and violence you have offer'd us, Burnt up our Frontire Townes, made prey before ye Both of our Beasts, and Corne; slaine our deare Subjects, Open'd the fountaine eyes of thousand widowes, That daily fling their curses on your fury; What ordinary satisfaction can salve this? What hasty thought-on Ransome give a remedy? You must excuse us yet, we'l take more counsell; In the meane time, not as a Prisoner, But as a noble Prince we entertaine ye. Sy. I am at your mercy Lady, 'tis my fortune, My stubborne fate; the day is yours, you have me, The valour of one single man has cross'd me, Crost me and all my hope; for when the Battels Were at the hottest game of all their furies, And conquest ready then to crowne me Victor, One single man broke in, one sword, one vertue, And by his great example thousands followed, O how I shame to think on't, how it shakes me! Nor could our strongest head then stop his fury, But like a tempest 'bore the field before him, Till he arriv'd at me, with me he buckell'd, A while I held him play; at length his violence Beat me from my Saddle, then on foot pursu'd me, There triumph'd once againe, then tooke me Prisoner: When I was gone a feare possest my people. Duch. One single arme, in a just cause, heaven prospers. Is not this stranger Knight as yet discover'd, That we may give his vertue a due honour? Lord. Not yet that we hear Madam, but to that purpose, Two dayes ago we publish'd Proclamations Enter Soto with a Trumpet, and Silvio. Soto. O dainty Duchesse, here I bring that Knight Before thy fragrant face, that warlike wight, He that Syenna's Duke, and all his Louts Beat (as the Proverb seemly sayes) to clouts: He that unhorss'd the man of fame to boot, And bootlesse taught his Grace to walk afoot: He that your writings (pack'd to every pillar) Promis'd promotion to, and store of filler, That very man I set before thy Grace, And once againe pronounce this man it was. Duch. A pretty foolish Squire, what must the Knight be? Sy. Some Jugler, or some Mad-man. Sil. I was not so, When thy faint Troopes in flockes I beat before me, When through the thickest of thy warlike horse I shot my selfe, even to thy Standard Duke, And there found thee, there singled thee, there shew'd thee The temper of my Sword. 'Tis true, thou stood'st me, And like a noble Souldier bid'st me welcome; And this ile say, More honour in that arme I found and tryed, then all thy Army carried: What followes thy Imprisonment can tell thee. Sy. His faire relation carries truth and vertue, And by those Armes I see (for such were his, So old, so rusty) this may be he that forc'd me. Sil. Do you know this Jewell, from your Cask I rent it, Even as I clos'd, and forced ye from your saddle; Do you now remember me? Sy. This is the valour Madam, for certaine he, it must be he, That day I wore this Jewell, you remember it. Duch. Yes, very well; not long before I sent it. Sy. That day I lost this Jewell, in fight I lost it, I felt his stroakes, and felt him take it from me, I wore it in my Cask; take it againe Sir, You won it nobly, 'tis the prize of honour. Soto. My Father, and my selfe are made for ever. Duc. Kneele down brave Sir, thus my Knight first I raise ye, Gird on a Sword; next Generall of my Army, Give him a Staffe; last, one in Counsell neare me. Now, make us happy with your sight: how? Silvio? Have I on thee bestow'd this love, this honour? The Treasons thou hast wrought set off with favours? Unarme him presently: O thou foule Traitor, Traitor to me, mine honour, and my Country, Thou kindler of these Warres. Sil. Mistake not Madam. Duch. Away with him to prison, See him safe kept, the Law shall shortly Sirra, Finde fitter titles for ye, then I gave ye. Soto. This is the youth that kild me, ile be quit with him, What a blinde rogue was I, I could never know him? And't please your Grace, I claime the benefit Of the Proclamation that proclaim'd him Traitor, I brought him in. Duch. Thou shalt have thy reward for't. Soto. Let him be hang'd, or drown'd then. Duch. Away with him. Sil. Madam, I crave your promise first; you are tyed to it, You have past your Princely word. Duch. Prove it, and take it. Sil. This is the day appointed, Appointed by your Grace for my appearance, To answer to the Question. Duch. I remember it. Sil. I claime it then, Duch. If you performe it not, The penalty you claime too. Sil. I not repent it; If I absolve the words? Duch. Your life is free then, You have drawne a speedy course above my wishes, To my rezenge, be sure ye hit it right, Or ile be sure you shall not scape the danger. Sil. My rest is up now Madam. Duch. Then play it cunningly. Sil. Now, where's the Hag? where now are all her promises, She would be with me, strengthen me, informe me? My death will now be double death, ridiculous: She was wont still to be neare, to feele my miseries, And with her Art, I see her no where now; What have I undertaken? now she failes me, No comfort now I finde, how my soule staggers? Till this houre never fear, nor doubt possest me, She cannot come, she will not come, she has fool'd me; Sure, she is the Devill, has drawne me on to ruine, And now to death bequeaths me in my danger. Sy. He stands distracted, and his colour changes. Duch. I have given him that will make his blood forsake him; Shortly his life. Sy. His hands and contemplation Have motion still, the rest is earth already. Duc. Come, will ye speak or pray? your time growes out Sir; How every where he looks? he's at last cast. Enter Belvidere, and secretly gives him a paper, and Exit. Sy. His colour comes againe fresh. Duc. 'Tis a flash, Sir, Before the flame burnes out; can ye yet answer? Sil. Yes Madam, now I can. Duch. I feare you'l faile in't. Sil. And do not think my silence a presage, Or Omen to my end, you shall not finde it; I am bred a Souldier, not an Orator, Madam, peruse this scrowle, let that speake for me, And as you are Royall, wrong not the construction. Duch. By Heaven you shall have faire play. Sil. I shall looke for't. Question. Tell me what is that onely thing, For which all women long; Yet having what they most desire, To have it do's them wrong. Answer. Tis not to be chaste, nor faire, Such gifts malice may impaire; Richly trim'd, to walke or ride, Or to wanton unespi'd; To preserve an honest name, And so to give it up to fame; These are toyes. In good or ill They desire, to have their will; Yet when they have it, they abuse it, For they know not how to use it. Duch. You have answer'd right, and gain'd your life, I give it. Sil. O happy Hag! But my most gracious Madam, Your promise tide a nobler favour to me. Duch. 'Tis true, my daughter too. Sil. I hope you will keep it. Duc. 'Tis not in my powre now, she is long since wanderd, Stolne from the Court, and me; and what I have not I cannot give: no man can tell me of her, Nor no search finde her out: and if not Silvio, Which strongly I beleeveâ Sil. Mock me not Lady, For as I am a servant to her vertue, Since my first howre of exile, I ne're saw her Lord. That she is gone 'tis too too true, and lamentable, Our last hope was in you. Sil. What do I heare then, And wherefore have I life bestow'd and honour? To what end do I walk? for men to wonder at, And fight, and foole? pray ye take your honours from me, (My sorrowes are not fit companions for 'em) And when ye please my life: Art thou gone Mistris, And wander'st heaven knowes where? this vow I make thee, That till I finde thee out, and see those faire eyes, Those eyes that shed their lights, and life into me, Never to know a friend, to seeke a kindred, To rest where pleasure dwells, and painted glory, But through the world, the wide world thus to wander, The wretched world alone, no comfort with me, But the meere meditations of thy goodnesse: Honour and greatnesse, thus adieu. Enter Belvidere. Bel. Stay Silvio, And Lady sit againe, I come for Justice. Sil. What would she now? Bel. To claime thy promise Silvio, The Boone thou swor'st to give me. Sy. What may this be, A woman, or a Devill? Duch. 'Tis a Witch sure, And by her meanes he came to untwist this Riddle, Sil. That I am bound to her for my liffe, mine honour, And many other thousand waies for comfort I here confesse: Confesse a promise too, That what she would aske me to requite these favours, Within the endeavour of my life to grant, I would; and here I stand my words full master. Bel. I wish no more: great Lady, witnesse with me, The Boone I crave for all my service to thee, Is now to be thy wife, to grant me marriage. Sil. How? for to marry thee? aske againe woman, Thou wilfull woman, aske againe. Bel. No more Sir. Sil. Aske land, and life. Bel. I aske thee for a Husband. Soto. Marry her, and beat her into Gun-powder, She would make rare Crackers. Sil. Aske a better fortune, Thou art too old to marry: I a Souldier, And alwaies married to my sword. Bel. Thy word Foole, Breake that, and ile breake all thy fortunes yet. Duch. He shall not, I am witnesse to his faith: and ile compell it. Sy. 'Tis fit ye hold your word, Sir. Sil. O most wretched. Duch. This was a fortune now beyond my wishes, For now my Daughter's free, if e're I finde her. Sy. But not from me. Duch. You are sharer in this happinesse, My selfe will wait upon this marriage, And do the old woman all the honour possible. Sy. Ile lead the Knight, and what there wants in dalliance, Wee'l take it out in drinke. Sil. O wretched Silvio. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter Lopez and Isabella. Lop. Hast thou sent for him? Isab. Yes, Lop. A young man, saist thou? Isab. Yes, very young, and very amarous. Lop. And handsom? Isab. As the Town affords. Lop. And dar'st thou Be so farre good, and Mistris of thine honour, To sleight these? Isab. For my husbands sake to curse 'em, And since you have made me Mistris of my fortune, Never to point at any joy, but husband, I could have cozen'd ye, but so much I love ye, And now so much I weigh the estimation Of an unspotted wifeâ Lop. I dare believe thee, And never more shall doubt torment my spirit. Enter Penurio. Isab. How now Penurio? Pen. The thing is comming, Mistris. Lop. Ile take my standing. Pen. Do, and ile take mine. Exit Lopes. Isab. Where didst thou leave him? Pen. I left him in a Cellar, Where he has paid me titely, paid me home Mistris, We had an hundred &amp; fifty healths to you, sweet Mistris, And three score and ten damnations to my Master; Mistris, shall I speak a foolish word to ye? Isab. What's that Penurio? The fellow's drunke. Pen. I would faine know your body. Isab. How's that? how's that prethee? Pen. I would know it carnally, I would conglutinate. Isab. The reason sirrah? Pen. Lobster, sweet Mistris, Lobster. Isab. Thy Master heares. Pen. Lobster, sweet Master, Lobster. Isab. Thou art the most precious rogue. Enter Claudio. Pen. Most pretious Lobster. Isab. Do you see who's here? go sleep ye drunken rascall. Pen. Remember you refuse me arm'd in Lobster. Exit. Isab. O my lost Rugio, welcome, welcome, welcome, A thousand welcomes here Ile seale. Cla. Pray ye stay, Lady, Do you love me ever at this rate? or is the fit now, By reason of some wrong done by your husband, More fervent on ye? Isab. Can I chuse but love thee? Thou art my Martyr, thou hast suffered for me, My sweet, sweet Rugio. Cla. Do you do this seriously? 'Tis true, I would be entertained thus. Isab. These are nothing, No kisses, no embraces, no endeerements, To thoseâ Cla. Do what you will. Isab. Those that shall follow, Those I will crowne our love withall; why sigh ye? Why look ye sad my deere one? Cla. Nay faith nothing, But me thinks so sweet a beauty, as yours showes to me, And such an innocence as you may make it, Should hold a longer Siege. Isab. Ha, you speake truth, Sir. Cla. I would not have it so. Isab. And now methinkes, Now I consider truly what becomes me, I have been cozen'd, fearefully abus'd, My reason blinded. Cla. Nay, I did but jest with ye. Isab. Ile take ye at your word, and thank ye for't Sir; And now I see no sweetnesse in that person, Nothing to stir me to abuse a Husband, To ruine my faire fame. Cla. Good Isabella. Isab. No hansome man, no any thing to doat on, No face, no tongue to catch me, poore at all points, And I an asse. Cla. Why do ye wrong me Lady? If I were thus, and had no youth upon me, My service of so meane a way to win ye, (Which you your selfe are conscious must deserve ye, If you had thrice the beauty you possesse, must reach ye) If in my tongue your fame lay wrack't, and ruin'd With every cup I drink: if in opinion I were a lost, defam'd man: but this is common Where we love most, where most we stake our fortunes, There least and basest we are rewarded: fare ye well, Know now I hate you too as much, contemne ye, And weigh my credit at as high a value. Isab. May be I did but jest. Cla. Ye are a woman, And now I see your wants, and mine owne follies, And task my selfe with indiscretion, For doating on a face so poore. Isab. Say ye so Sir, (I must not lose my end) I did but jest with you, Only fool'd thus to try your faith: my Rugio, Do you think I could forget? Cla. Nay, 'tis no matter. Isab. Is't possible I should forsake a constancy, So strong, so good, so sweet? Cla. A subtle woman. Isab. You shall forgive me, 'twas a trick to try ye, And were I sure ye lov'd meâ Cla. Do you doubt now? Isab. I do not doubt, but he that would professe this, And beare that full affection you make shew of, Should doâ Cla. What should I do? Isab. I cannot shew ye. Cla. Ile try thee damnedst Devill: hark ye Lady, No man shall dare do more, no service top me, Ile marry ye. Isab. How Sir? Cla. Your husbands sentenc'd, And he shall dye. Isab. Dye? Cla. Dye for ever to ye, The danger is mine owne. Isab. Dye did ye tell me? Cla. He shall dye, I have cast the way. Isab. O foule man, Malicious bloody man. Enter Lopez. Lop, When shall he dye Sir, By whom, and how? Cla. Hast thou betray'd me, woman? Isab. Base man, thou wouldst have ruin'd me, my name too, And like a Toad, poyson'd my vertuous memory: Further then all this, dost thou see this friend here, This only friend, shame take thy lost and thee, And shake thy soule, his life, the life I love thus, My life in him, my only life thou aim'dst at. Cla. Am I catch't thus? Lop. The Law shall catch ye better. Isab. You make a trade of betraying womens honours, And think it noble in ye to be lustfull, Report of me hereafterâ Cla. Fool'd thus finely? Lop. I must intreat ye walk, Sir, to the Justice, Where if hee'l bid ye kill meâ Cla. Pray stay a while, Sir, I must use a Players shift, do you know me now Lady? Lop. Your brother Claudio sure. Isab. O me, 'tis he Sir, O my best brother. Cla. My best sister now too, I have tryed ye, found ye so, and now I love ye, Love ye so truly nobly. Lop. Sir, I thank ye, You have made me a most happy man. Cla. Thank her Sir, And from this houre preserve that happinesse, Be no more fool'd with jealousie. Lop. I have lost it, And take me now new borne againe, new natur'd. Isab. I do, and to that promise tye this faith, Never to have a false thought tempt my vertue. Lop. Enough, enough, I must desire your presence, My Cozen Rhodope has sent in all hast for us, I am sure you will be welcome. Cla. Ile wait on ye. Lop. What the Project isâ Isab. We shall know when we are there, Sir. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Duchesse, Syenna, Lords, Silvio. Duch. Joy to you Silvio, and your young faire Bride, You have stolne a day upon us; you cannot wooe Sir. Sil. The joyes of Hell hang over me, O mischiefe, To what a fortune has the Devill driven me? Am I reserv'd for this? Sy. Beshrew me Sir, But you have gotten you a right faire bedfellow, Let you alone to chuse. Sil. I beseech your Grace, 'Tis misery enough to have met the Devill, Not mens reproches too. Sy. How old is she? Duch. A very Girle, her eye delivers it. Sy. Her teeth are scarce come yet. Lord. What goodly children Will they two have now? she is rarely made to breed on, What a sweet timberd body? Duch. Knotty i'th back, But will hold out the stronger; What a nose? Sy. I marry, such a nose, so rarely mounted, Upon my conscience, 'twas the part he doted on. Duch. And that fine little eye to it, like an Elephants. Lord. Yes, if her feet were round, and her ears sachells. Sy. For any thing we know. Sil. Have ye no mercy? No pitty in your bloods, to use a wretch thus? You Princes, in whose hearts the best compassions, Neerest to those in Heaven, should finde fit places, Why do you mock at misery? fling scornes and basenesse Upon his broken back, that sinks with sorrowes? Heaven may reward you too, and an houre come, When all your great designes shall shew ridiculous, And your hearts pinch'd like mine. Musick in divers places Duch. Fye Sir, so angry Upon your wedding day? go smug your selfe, The Maid will come anon: what Musick's this? Sy. I warrant you some noble preparation. Duch. Let's take our places then. Sil. More of these Devills dumps? Must I be ever haunted with these witchcrafts? Enter a Masquerado of severall Shapes and Daunces, after which enters Belvidere and dispenses them, before the Maskers enter two Presenters, among which are Bartello, Lopez, Claudio, Isabella, Rhodope, Soto, Penurio, Jaquenet. 1 Pre. Roome, roome for merry spirits, roome, Hether on command we come, From the good old Beldam sent, Cares and sorrowes to prevent. 2. Looke up Silvio, smile, and sing, After winter comes a spring. 1. Feare not faint foole what may follow, Eyes that now are sunk and hollow, By her Art may quick returne To their flames againe, and burne. 2. Art commands all youth, and blood, Strength and beauty it makes good. 1. Feare not then, dispaire not, sing Round about as we do spring: Cares and sorrowes cast away, This is the old wives holy-day. Daunce here, then enter Belvidere. Duch. Who is this? Sy. The shape of Belvidere. Bel. Now Silvio, How do'st thou like me now? Sil. Thus I kneele to thee. Bel. Stand up, and come no nearer, mark me well too, For if thou troublest me I vanish instantly: Now chuse wisely or chuse never, One thou must enjoy for ever. Do'st thou love me thus? Sil. Most dearely. Bel. Take heed foole, it concernes thee nearely. If thou wilt have me young and bright, Pleasing to thine eye and sight, Courtly, and admir'd of all, Take heed least thy fame do fall, I shall then be full of scorne, Wanton, proud, beware the horne, Hating what I lov'd before, Flattery apt to fall before, All consuming, nothing getting, Thus thy faire name comes to setting. But if old and free from these Thou shalt chuse me, I shall please: I shall then maintaine thee still, With my vertue and my skill: Still encrease and build thy name, Chuse now Silvio, here I am. Sil. I know not what to say, which way to turne me, Into thy Soveraigne will I put my answer. Bel. I thank ye Sir, and my will thus rewards ye, Take your old Love, your best, your dearest Silvio: No more Spells now, nor further shapes to alter me, I am thy Belvidere indeed, Deare Mother, There is no altering this, heavens hand is with it: And now you ought to give me, he has fairely won me. Sil. But why that Hag? Bel. In that shape most secure still, I followed all your fortunes, serv'd, and counsell'd ye, I met ye at the Farmers first a Country wench, Where fearing to be knowne I tooke that habit, And to make ye laughing sport at this mad marriage, By secret ayde of my friend Rhodope We got this Maske. Sil. And I am sure I have ye. Bel. For ever now, for ever. Duch. You see it must be, The wheele of destiny hath turn'd it round so. Sy. It must, it is, and curs'd be he that breakes it. Duch. Ile put a choyce to you Sir: ye are my Prisoner. Sy. I am so, and I must be so, till it please youâ Duch. Chuse one of these, either to pay a Ransome, At what rate I shall set it, which shall be high enough, And so returne a Free-man, and a Bachellor, Or give me leave to give you a fit wife, In honour every way your Graces equall, And so your Ransom's paid. Sy. You say most nobly, Silvio's example's mine, pray chuse you for me. Duc. I thank ye Sir, I have got the mastry too, And here I give your Grace a husbands freedome, Give me your hand, my Husband. Sy. You much honour me, And I shall ever serve ye for this favour. Bart. Come Lopez, let us give our wives the breeches too, For they will have 'em. Lop. Whilst they rule with vertue Ile give 'em, skin and all. Isab. Wee'l scratch it off else. Sil. I am glad ye live, more glad ye live to honour, And from this houre a stronger love dwell with us; Pray you take your man againe. Cla. He knowes my house Sir. Duch. 'Tis sin to keep you longer from your Loves, Wee'l lead the way; and you young men that know not How to preserve a wife, and keep her faire, Give 'em their soveraign wills, &amp; pleas'd they are. Exeunt. Here endeth Women pleas'd.</field>
