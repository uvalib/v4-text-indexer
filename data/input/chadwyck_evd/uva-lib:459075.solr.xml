      <field name="fulltext">To his Worthy Friend Mr. Thomas Forde on his LOVES LABYRINTH. True Friend, while others me out-vie, and grace thee (As thou dost them far more) I scarce can trace thee I many thousand miles do wander Of Pilgrimage in thy MÃ¦ander, Till by the golden thred, Of Love I'm safe through led. Thy Wit is far beyond the Serpentine; Thy wreathings chequer-work and warp divine; Thy curious inter-woven Plots, Rich twine, ty'd all in Lovers-knots: Thy Skill is exquisite, To untie and unite. Thy Tent-works in-let pleases me so well, I'de have none out-let: I'de rather dwell. I love thy labyrinth, and approve, That thou shouldst labyrinth my love: There I poor well-hous'd elf Might safely lose my self. I see, work-women a'n't above workmen, How far short comes the needle of the pen! Those Damosels, who are so devouts In pricking little holes in clouts, Thy lively Tapestry-story Out-strips their painted glory. Let spleen it self judge eithers manu tract: Their female works can't speak, thy male-words Act. A drop of this your art (Sr.) passes Beyond an Ocean of allusivÃ² ad gr. ????????. the Lasses Their byas-stitch doth squint, But thine's down-right in print. Nay all thou do'st would be such ne'retheless, Though it ne're saw the light, nor felt the press. Thy last impression comes behind, The first and chief is in thy mind: Thou art beyond the rest, Thy first Edition's best. None living can (I probably conjecture) No not thy self) repair this Architecture. Each line's right perpendicular, Reason thy Plum, and Truth thy Square: Each full-point may be sead, A nail driv'n to the Head. But I could wish there were no period, That (though all's even) yet something still were od; That after all Exits might begin Still more fresh Intrats to come in. The whole frame so divine is, Nought vexes me but FINIS. N. C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my ingenious Friend, Mr. Thomas Forde, on His LOVES LABYRINTH. Who truly will thy Labyrinth commend, Shall find it hard, both to begin, and end: Yet thou hast spun a thred, with which t'untwine The wandring Lover, though all things combine To stop his passage: Such a flowing Style Thou usest too, as did my sense beguile: For whilest I read, I neither ScÃ¦ne nor Stage, âCould think were feign'd: I saw an Active Rage âAppear in Damocles, which to my eye âNot Acted seem'd, but real Tyranny. âSephestia's love and doom; the better fate âOf Pleusidippus, not more fortunate: âFor he Loves Labyrinth did also tread, âAnd Court incestuously his Mothers Bed. âAnd so her father, husband too (none known) âYet he by sympathy did claim his own, âAnd had a grant, which mov'd the Tyrants spleen, â(Since he could not enjoy her for his Queen) âTo kill e'm both; their destinies prevent, âAs loth to have destroy'd the innocent. âYet at the last each thing succeeds with good: âThough the foundation seem'd t'be laid in blood. âAnd then the harmless shepherds rural sport, âWhose innocence makes every place a Court. And all things in so consonanat a dress, Makes more the seeming, not the being less. That (credit me) there is not in't a line, ('Tis all so rare) but I could wish were mine. And as before, so I say now of this, Thou hast thy skill by Metempsychosis. Proceed then Worthy Friend, and may thy Fame, Like Laureat Johnson, ever speak thy Name. Edw. Barwick.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. ScÃ¦ne 1. Enter King Damocles with two Lords, and Lamedon. King. Can this be true? 1 Lo. My Liege, as truth it self. King. And will neither the power of a King, Nor precepts of a father over-sway Her fond affections; but that thus she will Run head-long to her ruine? Let her go. 1 Lo. Yet shot she not at rovers, but a Prince He is, young and deserving; therefore since Sh'has hit the mark, it will now be in vain To give her aym, or make her shoot again. Kin. Was she so hasty, that she could not stay To take our Fatherly advice with her? No wonder if she wander in the Labyrinth Of love, without the clew of our counsel. La. Come brother, come, she's not the first has done Amiss; her own affections were the surest guide Unto her own content: she chose to please Her self, not you, come, let this anger cease. 1 Lo. 'Tis now too late for to recal what's past, The match is made, and that so surely fast, 'Tis past dissolving now; a Grandfather You are alreay: From their conjunction hath This influence proceeded, a fair boy Hath given them earnest of succeeding joy. Kin. How! a boy! and shall that base brat enjoy My crown? no, no, I'll take a course for that. La. Why brother, 'tis a Prince by birth, &amp; why Not born to Reign? Kin. Ay, mischief's on my head, But I'll prevent the plot and storm, we'l send Them far enough from troubling of our state: Distance and danger shall they first subdue, Before they gain our Crown; the slavish waves Shall be their subjects: let them go and and win The trydent of great Neptune, waters King. I mean to set them forth. 1 Lo. What means my Liege? Kin. Nay, I'm resolv'd, since that they do no more Regard my favour, they shall feel my frowns. O ye CÅlestial Deities! where are Your power and wonted justice now become? All things run head-long, and the feet forget Their duty to their Head, and traitors turn, Breaking the bonds of government; that now A Princes power, or Fathers care's contemn'd, And only recompenc'd with slight and scorn. Lam. But Sir, though she her duty do forget To you, yet is she still your child, and may Be easily reclaimed. Shall one misdeed Forfeit all former loyalty? She us'd To be more ready to give, than you Could be to ask. Come, let the weight of that O're-poize your anger, and this light offence. Kin. I'll hear no more, all pity now is gone, And anger hath the castle of my breast So strongly fortified, whole valleys of Requests can never move: cease then your suit, To which my ears are deaf, and tongue is mute. 1 Lo. Heaven is not so impregnable, but that Entreaties may both siege and conquer it: If that your daughter hath run on the score Of one offence, will nothing cancel it? Kin. My resolution's writ in Adamant. 1 Lo. Dread Sir, and may not tears then blot it out? Kin. Nor all the liquid drop the sea contains Shall quench my rage; for now I have forgot All pitie of a father, and that wretch Shall feel what 'tis to lose a fathers love.â Since she will needs slight and contemn our care, I'll have a Bark provided, without oar, Or sail, or pilot, but the wilful wind, And waves, true emblemes of their giddy act, And therein with her brat, and mate imbarqu'd, Shall seek their fortunes: And see you it done Without delay, our Will admits no time, T'expostulate no more than alteration. 1 Lo. O good my Lord command my service in Some nobler act than this and do not try My faith in that, for which I'de rather die, Than do't. What heir shall succeed your self In the Arcadian Diadem, if thus you drown The Sun of all our hopes, which must Supply your place, when as your Sun shall set In darkest clouds of death, must night ensue, And seize upon our Horizon?âO let Some pity of our drooping state prevail. Kin. All will not do. I'll have it done; then go Or stay and pull my vengeance on thy head. Will you turn traytor too, to our commands? As you tender our favour, or your safety, Go execute my will without delay. 1 Lo. And must my safety prove their ruin? can They not live, but I must die? I'll do't. Perhaps the tyrant-waves may prove more kind Than is their King My Liege I'l ease your mind. Lam. And must they, &amp; they only prove (poor hearts) A sacrifice to fury for their love? I'll be companion of their fortune. We Will leave this cursed land, which is nought else But a dry sea of miseries, in which We dayly float; the sea can never be More merciless. O what a maze of woe Do lovers tread (dire fate) that for their love, Are recompenc'd with hatred. Farewel world, Thou ball of fortune banded to and fro, And never quiet; we will try what fate Awaits us in the sea, it can't be worse Than here we suffer by our dearest friends. Kin. Well brother, since you are so weary of The world, pray take your share with them, and care Of her: I leave her unto you, and to The mercies of the waves, and so adieu. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 2. 2 Lo. Was ever man so resolute to undo, What an whole age can't recompence again? To cast away a Lady of that worth, That bankrupt nature cannot furnish forth Her Parallel: A beauty that would tempt The gods to lust: But guarded with an eye So modestly severe, it would strike dead All lustful hopes of the hot ravisher. See where she comes, like PhÅbus newly rose From Thetis bed: Little doth she suppose The cruelty of her once happy Father, In having such a daughter, now not fit T'enjoy a blessing which he values not. Seph. What news my Lord? Is the ice of my fathers Anger broken? Hath the sun of counsel Thaw'd his frozen breast? 1 Lo. Ay, into a floodâ Seph. What meanes this passion? Speak man, for I am Prepar'd; it can't be worse than I expect. 1 Lo. Why then it isâ Let me first drown my self In mine own tears, and vent my mind in sighs: Madam, you may guess sooner than I can tell. Seph. Prethee torment me not thus with delays, More tedious than the thing can be, what e're It is. Come, I am armed with the shield Of patience, my breast is mischief-proof. 1 Lo. 'Tis easier far to tell than execute: I wish my task were done with telling it. Madam, He hath made me the sad Over-seer Of that dire act, which he so fears to speak. Silence will not relieve, it may protract The doing of that horrid fact, which who Shall hear, will loath the name of father, for Your fathers sake, who when perhaps y'are gone, By's want will prize your worth the more, and love You better than he ever did before. Thus are we taught to value of the light, By the dull silence of the darker night. Sep. But to your story, and my doom, which sure Must needs be great, that it can find no vent. Come ease your shoulders of this burthen, lay It on mine, who have deserved it. 1 Lo. Lady, wonder not at our unwillingness To tell what we had rather wish our tongues Out, than to be th'unhappy messengers Of such sad news, the truth whereof must rob Arcadia of it's richest, choisest Gem, That doth adorn her Princely Diadem: By venturing all our hopes to the mercy Of the cruel waves, He hath prest to be Your only Pilot; being ship't alone, With your dear babe and husband, without sail, Or oar, to contradict the lawless seas, In their unbounded raging tyranny: Whose heedless rigour yet may hap to prove More kind unto you than your fathers love. Sep. Heavens will be done: But had another hand Inflicted this, it would have lighter seem'd:â Yet is there comfort in his cruelty, That hath not parted me from him, for whom All this will be but light; his company Will sweeten all my sorrows, and convert My mourning into mirth: Can I be sad, Enjoying him will only make me glad? Enter Lamedon. Lam. I cannot win my brother to reverse His cruel sentence, but it must be done.â Dear Neece, I'm thy companion; misery Shall never make my friendship to turn edge, But at the lowest ebb of fortune shall My love still flow: the sea shall never quench That flame which virtue once hath kindled in My breast, nor shall it meet, or be put out With any cold extinguisher but death. If many shoulders make griefs burthen light, Then so shall ours: and may mine cease to be, When they shall cease to bear their equal part, And sympathize with thee, as doth my heart. Seph. Uncle, my thanks. How rare it is to find A friend in misery! Men run from such, Like Deer from him is hunted with the dogs, As if that misery infectious were. Men fly with Eagles wings away, But creep like snails, when they should succour lend. I cannot therefore chuse but prize your love, Who dare be true unto your friend; a name Nearer than that of kindred, or of blood: This is th'effect of noblest virtue, which Ties firmer knots than age can e're undo: Such is the knot my Maximus and I Have tied, spight of my fathers anger, it Shall hold, when envy's tired to invent Mischiefs, in vain, to cut the knot in two, Which heaven hath knit too fast to loose again. Alas fond man! who thinks to unravel what The gods have wove together.â'Tis in vain. ScÃ¦n. 3. 1 Lo. Lady, time cals upon you not to stay, Lest by a fond delay you call upon His fury to convert into some worse, And sudden punishment, which may deny All hopes of future safety; of all ills The least is always wisely to be chosen. Seph. Go and prepare that floting grave, which must Devour's alive, I will attend you here. Before when will my dearest find his grief, In finding me thus lost without relief. Exeunt. Manet Sephestia. Why doth my Love thus tarry? surely he Forgotten hath the place, or time, or else He would not stay thus long; but can I blame Him, to be slow to meet his ruine? I Could wish he would not come at all, that so He yet might live, although I perish; but How fondly do I wish to be without Him, without whom alas! I cannot live. 'Twere as impossible as without air: He 'tis for whom I suffer, and with him, All places are alike to me.âSee where He comes, who is sole keeper of my heart. Enter Maximus. Max. My dear! Seph. Ah, dear indeed, for whom thy life Must pay the shot of cruelty enrag'd.â Max. What meanes my love? is't she, or do I dream? Sure this cannot be she, whose words were wont To be more sweet than honey, soft as oil: These words, more sharp than daggers points, ne're came From her I knowâWhat sayst thou my sweet? Seph. The sameâtruth will not suffer me to speak Other, lest I should injure her:âO that 'Twere possible so to dispense with truth, Not to betray our selvesâI know not what to say.â Max. Heavens bless us, what a sudden change is here? Love, who hath wrong'd thee? tell me, that I may Thrid their lives upon my sword, &amp; make their Dead trunks float in their own blood, till they blush At their own shame: Tell me my heart, who is't? Seph. Alas poor soul! thou little dreamst what sad News do's await thine ears; my tongue doth fail, Not daring once to name the thing must be Our loves sad end, and dire Catastrophe. My fathers furyâOh that that name I once delighted in, should odious be To mine affrighted senses!âBut for thee Alone, it is I grieve, not for my self.â Max. Be't what it will, so that it be but in Relation to thy love, I will embrace, And hug, and thank that malice too, that so Invented hath a means whereby I may But testifie my loyalty to thee: For whose sweet sake I would encounter with Legions of armed furies; sacrifice My dearest blood unto thy service, which I more esteem, than all the wealth the world Can boast of: 'Tis thee alone I value, Above whatever mens ambitious thoughts Can fathom with their boundless appetites. Seph. This flame of love must now be quenched in The foaming sea; we are design'd a prey Unto the fury of winds and waves.â The deadly Barque's providing, which must be Our moving habitation; the sea Must be our Kingdom, and the scaly frie Our subjects:âThis, this, the portion is Of fortunes frowns, and fathers fiercer hate. Fly, fly, my dearest Maximus, and save My life in thine; oh stay no longer here. weeps Max. Why dost thou torment thy self before Thy time? wilt thou anticipate the sea? And drown thy self in tears? Deny me not To share with thee in suffering, as well As I have done in pleasure; 'tis for me This storm is rais'd, were I once cast away, His rage would cease. I, I have wrong'd thee, And I'll be just to thee and to my word. draws I'll ope the sluces of my fullest veins, And set them running, till they make a flood, Wherein I'll drown my selfâ He offers to kill himself. She stays his hand. Seph. Thine heart lies here; 'Tis here, lock't up securely in my brest: First open that, and take it out; for death Shall ne're divorce me from thy company: I will attend thee through those shady vaults Of death, or thou shalt live with me.âDost think This body possible to live without A soul? or without thee? Have pitie on Thy tender babe, whose life depends on thine, And make not me widow, and him orphan, With unadvised rashnessâSheath thy sword. Max. Mine eyes will ne're endure it, to behold, Thee miserable, no, no, death first shall draw A sable veil of darkness over themâ Pardon my rashness, I will live with thee, And tire thy fathers rage with suffering, So he'l but suffer thee to live in mirth, The greatest sorrow shall not make me sad. Seph. Here comes my father, cerainly his rage Will know no bounds: I fear it will Break forth into some desperate act on me. Max. Although he be a King, which sacred name I reverence, and as a mortal god Adore; he shall not dare to injure you Before my face: first shall he wear my life Upon his sword, if he but dare to touch Thy sacred self.â ScÃ¦n. 4. Enter Damocles. Kin. How now light-skirts? have you got your Champion To shield you from our anger? know I have Not yet forgot the name of father, though You thus have slighted it; but as a King, We must be just to punish your contempt. Did you so well know your beauty to be Proud of it, and yet so little value it, As thus to throw it all away at once? Well, get you gone.âSince that you have esteem'd A strangers love before your loyalty To me, or my care to you, a stranger shall Inherit what you were born to, had not Your fond affections forc'd this vile exchange. Max. Sirâfor your fury will not suffer me To call you father; think not your daughter Undervalued by her love to me: Her love ran not so low, as to be stoop'd To meet with crime, who am a Prince no less Than is your self: Cyprus my Kingdome is. Kin. What drew you hither then? you must needs know It is no less than treason for to steal An heir to our crown: what drew you hither? Max. Hither I came, drawn by that forcible Attractive, for to offer up my self A sacrifice at th'altar of her love. Tost with a sea of miseries, I came To anchor in the haven of her heart: And if this be treason, I shall not blush To be esteem'd a traytor. But if not, Then pardon me, if bolder innocence Doth force me tell you, 'tis not just in you Thus to oppose what Heavens have decreed. Believe me, Sir, it's neither safe nor just, For you to violate the lawes of fate. Kin. Let not your pride so far transport you, that You tax our justice. I shall scourge your haste Into a leisurely repentance, when The sea shall teach you that your teares, and th'wind That sighs become your headlong rash attempts. Max. Great Sir, lay what you will on me, I scorn To crave your favour for my self; but yet Let Nature prompt you to be merciful To her who is a chief part of your self. Kin. No, as ye have joyn'd your selves in mirth, so Will I joyn ye too in mourning; and because Two no good consort make, my brother shall Bear a third part in your grave harmonie. Seph. Father, let me the heavy burthen bear Of this sad song alone: let all your fierce Justice center in my breast.â Kin. No more, Our sentence is irrevocable, nought Shall satisfie me else: I'll have it done. 1 Lo. My Liege, the barque is ready, and attends Your pleasure; the commands of Kings are not To be gain-said, or broken; for the will Of heaven is obey'd in doing them. Seph. We do obey it then, and willingly, Father, for yet I can't forget that name, Although these injuries would raze it out My memorie; I will not now dispute, But readily obey your will: and know The pleasures of your Court should not entice Me shun this comming terrour, which will be, More welcome to me by my companie. And thus I take my leave. Here may you find She kneels. That happiness you wish, and we shall want Whilest that we prove our selves loves Confessors, If not his Martyrs.â Kin. I will hear no more. Away with them, my Lord, you know the place, Our sentence and the time, I long to see Me, and my Kingdom from these monsters free. Max. Arcadia adieu! Thou hast before Been famous for the happiness of Ioves: Now mischief hath usurp't the seat, and may It be the object of the gods hatred, Since Love's the subject of their crueltie. Come dearest, let us winde our selves so close, That envie may admire, and so despair To enter here, where love possession keeps. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 5. Kin. Now shall I live secure, for now there is None left, whose nearness to our blood might edge Their hopes, by killing us to gain our Crown. Kings lives are never safe from those that wish Their ends, which must initiate them into Th'enjoyment of a Kingdom; this same crown Is such a bait unto ambitious spirits, 'Tis never safe upon the wearers head. Enter Artaxia weeping. Why weeps my dear? Art. Ask why I do not weep. (Poor Artaxia) are my tears denied me! Ask why I do not rave, tear my hair thus, Why such a weight of sorrow doth not rob So much of woman from me, as complaints! Or rather, why do I not cloud the skie With sighs; till at the last with one bold stab My own hand take from insulting fortune, This miserable object of her sport. Ask why I do not this, not why I weep! Kin. Or stint thy teares, or mingle mine with them, By a relation of their cause; these eyes Trust me Artaxia, are not yet drawn dry, Nor hath strong sorrow e're exhausted them, To make them bankrupt of a friendly tear, But not a fond one. Why Artaxia! Why dost thou hasten those that come too fast, Sorrow and age, clear up thy clouded brow. Art. Ah Damocles! how hast thou lost thy self! And art become a monster, not a man, Thus to deprive me of my onely joy, The onely stay and comfort of mine age, Which now must fall. Break heart, and give My sorrows vent. Ah! my Sephestia's gone, For ever lost unto the world and me. Kin. Content thy self, not I, but justice hath Depriv'd us of her: Justice, that is blind To all relations, and deaf to intreats Of fond nature, or fonder affection. Art. Ah cruel justice! Justice! no tyranny, This is: Death, be my friend, &amp; joyn once more My dear Sephestia and meâI come Stabs her self. Sephestia I come; curs'd world farewel. Kin. Help, help, Artaxia, my dear, help, help, Sephestia doth live, she is not dead. Art. Oh, 'tis too lateâoh-oh-ohâ She dies. Enter 2 Lords. 2 Lor. Heavens! what a sight is here? The Queen, she's dead, stark dead, what shal we do? This wretched land is fruitful grown of late, Of nothing else but miseries and woes. Jove sends his darts like hail-shot, no place free: Kin. Ah miserable man I am, a wretch, Who thus have lost two jewels that the world Can't recompence: I know not what to do.â Now could I tear my self in pieces, that I have Thus parted friends, &amp; left my self alone. Offers to kill himself. I am resolv'd, I will no longer live. 2 Lo. Stay, good my Liege, live, &amp; repent of what Y'have done, you have killd enough already. Kin. If I should kill my self, and lose my crown, I were better live.âCall us a Council quickly. But my wife, my dearest Artaxia! That I could breath life into thee again, Or else were with thee! 2 Lo. He's not yet so mad. Kin. O ye powers above! what mean ye thus To wrack us mortals with such blacker deeds Than hell it self! or remove them, or take All senses from us. Bear the bodie in, And summon all our Lords with speed t'attend Upon us, that we may find out from whence It is we suffer this sad influence. Exit. 2 Lo. Unhappy King! he hath undone himself, And all the Land. His sublimated rage Hath sowne a crop of mischiefs, which no age Can parallel; great-belly'd time is big With sorrows; and our next succeeding times, Must reap the harvest of his bloody crimes. Exit.

      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Menaphon, and Doron. Men: How mad a thing is Love? It makes us lose Our senses; whilest we wander in a maze Of endless torments: sometime with his smiles The cunning thief doth flatter us with hopes And tantalize our expectations, when Strait our winged joyes are gone, and we Do wrack our selves with future coming fears: A mistris frowns doth cloud our clearer skie. 1. Fond love no more, Will I adore Thy feigned Deity. Go throw thy darts, At simple hearts, And prove thy victory. 2. Whilst I do keep My harmless sheep, Love hath no power on me: 'Tis idle soules, Which he controules, The busie man is free. Enter Doron. Dor. Ah Menaphon, my Sister Pesana, a pies On her, I had almost forgot her name, with Thinking on her business. Men. VVhy what's thy business, Doron? tell me, come. Dor. My business, 'tis none of my businesse, I tell you, 'Tis my sister Pesana's business. Men. VVell, what's her business then? I prethee tell. Dor. Ah Sir! she's sick. Men. VVhat is she sick of Doron? let me know. Dor. VVhy, truly Sir, she's sick of you. Men. She sick of me? why, am I a disease? Dor. I meanâI meanâshe is sick for you. Men. That's kindly done of her, Doron, that she Will be sick for me: I'll make her amends. Dor. Will you make her amend, said you? I am Afraid you'l make her end first; but truly Menaphon I have a suit for you. Men. Hast thou a suit for me? Is it a new one? Dor. I say I have a suit to you. Men. To me? well, and what is your suit made of? Dor. In good sooth, Sir, I must intreat you will Love my sister as well as you have done. Men. No, Doron, love and I are faln out, and he Will not let me love thy sister or thee either. Dor. Nor my sister, nor me neither. Out thou Caterpiller, thou weasel, thou he dg-hog, I will make you love me, and my sister too. Men, You are out of your suit now Doron, and I fear you will catch cold, now you are hot. Exeunt.

A land happy in giving birth to my Sephestia: Ah my Sephestia!â But now not my Sephestia, since the waves Have ravish'd her from me, and all my hopes Are prov'd abortive; why do I now live! Since she is gone, whose life &amp; mine were both Twisted on one thred! Ye fatal Sister! Why did not your cruel knife cut my life In twain, when hers was broken oft by the Rude waves &amp; blustring wind, who strove which should Gain her from each? But both from me have robd Here now may the sea well boast, and out-vie The begger'd earth; since it hath her who was The earth's whole sum of riches. O ye gods! Why did ye once make me so happy To enjoy her, and now snatch'd her again To make me thereby the more miserable? Yet is she not quite drowned; for her heart Is here: 'tis mine the sea doth prey upon. Well, my Sephestia, oh that name doth ravish Me: This body shall a monument be, And my whole life a continued Elegie, Both consecrated to thy memorie. I'll drown thee once more in my tears, Which I will daily pay, as tribute to thee. Cyprus adieu, greatness also farewel. I see, those who are lifted highest on The hill of honour, are nearest to the Blasts of envious fortune, whilst the low And valley fortunes are far more secure. Humble valleys thrive with their bosoms full Of flowers, when hills melt with lightning, and rough Anger of the clouds. I will retire from The front of honour, to the rear of a Shepherds life: where whilst I do daily tend The harmless sheep, will I sing forth sad notes Of their blest happiness, and my misfortune, I will no longer keep this miserable name Of Maximus, but clad in sorrows weeds, Will I wear the name of Melecertus. No more Maximus Prince of Cyprus, but A poor shepherd will I be: when you see Those weeds, and hear Melecertus name, I am that wretched he, who, like the snake, Have cast my former coat by creeping through The hole of miserie, and got a new. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 3. Enter Doron. Dor. My Carmela is comming, and I'm provided to cast A sheeps eye at her. He flings at her. Enter Carmela. Car. Now I see how Love came blind, he flung His eyes at me in stead of a love-dart. Dor. Ha, my Carmela, let me kiss thy hony-suckle lips: Car. You kiss so hard, you'l leave your beard behind. Dor. By my troth, Carmela, swains cannot swear, ButâI do love theeâby our great god Pan I love thee. Car. You said you could not swear, and yet you Swear you love me. Dor. Love, I have stared so long at thee, that I Am now grown blind. Car. Then shall you be led, like blind beggars With a dog and a bell, or else be beholding To the glasier for a new pair of eyes. Dor. I know not what you mean eyes, but I am Sure that I am off the hooks. You tell me of Eyes, eyes, but 'tis your no's that torments me. This blind god, that the Poets call Cupid, has seen To hit me with his dart, I know not how, But as the blind man kil'd the crow. Car. Then you are one of the wanderers in Loves Labyrinth, I prethee let me lead thee. Dor. Ay, so we may both fall; but no matter, For if you fall first, I'll fall on thee. Car. Fie, Doron, fie, are you not asham'd? Dor. Asham'd? of what? marry better falling in, than Falling out. Car. You'r very merry Doron, where's your musick? Dor. Let me play on thee, my pretty bag-pipe, And I know thou wilt sing, loth to depart.â Car. And I'll try that, now follow me. Exit. Dor. Nay, when you came to the snuff once, I thought You would quickly go out. ScÃ¦n. 4. Enter Menaphon. Oh Menaphon, hark, I am undone, as a man Should undo an oyster. Men. Why Doron, what's to do with thee now? Dor. Why man, thy sister Carmela is grown proud, And is just such another as thy self, she slights And scorns poor Doron; and yet because I love her, As my sister doth thee, she laughs at me. Well, I will be even with her; for if she won't love Me with a good will, I'll love her against her Will; and I think I shall be even with her there. Men. Come, Doron, come, count love a toy, As I do, who take far more joy to view My flocks; here's my content; when heavens frown, I think upon my faults; and a clear skie Puts me in mind of the gods gracious love: Envie o're-looketh me, nor do I gaze So high as tall ambition; and for love, I feed my self with fancies, such as these. Venus (the Poets say) sprang from the sea, Which notes to me th'inconstancie of love, Changing each day with various ebbs &amp; tides, Sometimes o're-flowing the banks of fortune With a gracious look from a lovers eyes, Ebbing at other times to th'dangerous shelf Of cold despair, from a Mistris frowns. Your Cupid must be young, to shew He is a boy, his wings inconstance tell: He's blind, to note his aym is without rule, Or reasons guide; such is the god ye serve. Dor. Treason, treason against the god of love: well Menaphon, though you be my friend, I will Have you articl'd against at the next meeting Of the Shepherds. Men. Lovers sorrows be like to the restless Labours of Sisyphus. Dor. Like thy tongue then. Men. Your Mistris favour's honey mixt with gall A bitter sweet, a folly worst of all, That forceth reason to be fancies thrall. Then love who list for me, if beauty be So sowr, then give me labour still. Exit. Dor. How I would laugh to see Menaphon once Manacl'd with loves fetters, that he might repent His blasphemy against the shepherds deitie. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 3. Enter Sephestia shipwrack't, with her Uncle Lamedon. Seph. Ah cruel fortune, but more cruel father, Most wretched I, who thus am rob'd of all My pregnant hopes, my springing joyes blasted With winter frowns. Jove send a flaming dart Into my breast, to melt my frozen heart Into a flood of tears, that I may drown My self in them since that the waves have prov'd Unkindly courteous to preserve my life, But to prolong my miserie, and he Is drownd who was my lifes preserver. Ah ye enraged deities! could ye Be so unkind to draw my life's thred out Thus long, to survive him who was my life? Why did ye not, or save his life with mine, Or destroy mine with his, that so I might Enjoy his companie in life or death? Lam. Ay, in the gods time, Neece, but not before. Seph. And oh! my dearest Plusidippus! could The waves be so hard-hearted, as to crop Thy blooming youth, to send thee to thy grave Before thou wert a man? Had they but left Me thee, it would have eas'd thy fathers loss, If I had had his transcript to have view'd In thee, who wert his perfect Image. Now In stead of heir to the Cyprus crown, The cypress grove shall be Joynter, where I'll sadly spend the remnant of my life, To weep my losses, and my own sad fate, Which thus I will revenge; my Maximus Shall live still fresh within my memorie, There fixt too sure for all the briny waves To wash away. Nor shall I e're forget My son, my Plusidippus. I could feed, My self unto eternitie with these Sweet names, which do as far out-vie The Nectar and Ambrosia of the gods, As pearls do pebbles. I can hold no more, My heart's so full, 'twill break, or over-run The sluces of mine eyes.âI'll weep the rest. Lam. Why dost thou thus torment thy self in vain? Thy tears wil not recover them again. Fates dart is shot, and cannot be recall'd, Nor is there any salve for fortunes wounds, But patience; therefore seeing me Partaker of thy sorrows, now lean all Thy cares on me, it is some relief, In sorrow to have fellows of our grief. Soph. My husband and my son are gone, and I Survive alone unto their miserie. Lam. Chance is like Janus, double-fac'd; sometimes With smiles she comforts us, sometimes With frowns she casts us down again: A calm Succeeds a storm, and a sharp winter doth Precede a pleasant spring. Seph. Oft turnings tire The weary traveller; and love doth lose His followers, in a wild Labyrinth Of woes. How am I faln from all my hopes! (An exile in my native Country:) and The crown hope seem'd to place upon my head: Banished from the pleasures of the Court, Parted for love from him I could not chuse But love, from Maximus, who hath for me Suffer'd as many mischiefs as malice Could invent, and now all sum'd up in death. Lam. What of all this? after the storm that rent Our ship, we found a calm that brought us safe To th'shore, whilst Neptunes mercie was beyond The envious blasts of Ãolus; and thus The gods do recompense us with their favour, For the dis-courtesies of your father. Seph. Sweet Lamedon, once partner of my joyes, Though now partaker of my wants; I see You are as constant in my sad distress, As you were faithful in my richer fortunes: Though friends seldom prove friends in poverty Misfortune hath not chang'd your mind, but your Temper my exile with your banishment: Your aged years shall be my sole directors, Your will the ruler of my actions. If you perswade me to content, Portia Shall not exceed Sephestia's patience: If you will have me strike my sails, I will, And steer my course by th'compass of your care. Lam. Since hope is all the portion we have left, Let's thank the gods that sav'd our lives, and rest Our cares on them, they can return us more Than we have lost, or fit our minds to bear Our present state. Contentment gives a crown, Where fortune hath denied it: patience Makes all things easie to an humble mind. Cares are companions of the Crown, the Court Is full of busie thoughts, and envious strife, Whilst peaceful sleeps attend a Countrey life. Seph. Then Lamedon will I disguise my self, And with my cloaths will change my former thoughts, Measure my actions by my present state, Not by my former fortunes, Sephestia No more: Alas! I know not where, or how VVe shall bestow our selves: Surely this is Some un-frequented place, no harmless sheep Do feed, nor shepherds tend their thriving flocks. Enter to them Menaphon ScÃ¦n. 6. Sephestia, Lamedon, Menaphon. Men. Heavens! what a sight is here! Such stars appear But rarely in our Country Hemisphere, I am so Planet-struck with one short glance, I neither can retire nor yet advance. VVhat resolution is of proof against Such charms as these! Some goddess hath assum'd An humane shape to tempt us weaker mortals. Cupid, I cry thee mercie now, although I were an Atheist unto thee before, Thou art the Deitie I will adore.â Sure they are in distress, those pearly tears Furrow her cheeks with cruel strife Which shall run fastest, are no sooner dried, New sighs, like the warm southern wind proclame A fresh approaching showre. I fear they are Some passengers late shipwrack't, for I saw, (When walking by the shore) some floting parts Of a torn ship, contending with the waves. Lam. Courteous shepherd, if distressed persons Fortune hath rob'd, and the sea favoured (If it be a favour to live and want) May crave your aid so far, as to direct Us to some place may rest our wearied bones, Our charges shall be paid, and you shall have For recompence, such blessings as the gods Use to bestow on hospitable men. Men. Strangers, your qualitie I know not, nor Shall now dispute; but if a country cell May not too disparage you, here is Hard by my cottage, and your home. Seph. Kind Sir, your courtesie is much beyond Our merit, and our present hopes below A suitable return; please you accept Our thanks, as earnest of that larger debt Future abilitie may see discharg'd. Men. Lady, I have no curious hangings to Adorn my walls, nor plate to shew my wealth: Yet do I live content; and you shall find Such welcome as a cottage can afford. Lam. Sir, blame not our wills, but present want, which now Makes us thus plentiful only in thanks. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 7. Enter Doron, Carmela. Dor. Carmela, by my great bel-weather, Carmela, I'm over the tops of my high-shooes in love, And there shall I stick and starve, if thou dost Not pull me out.âWhere hast thou been This live-long hour? Car. What, does the mouth of your affections water? Dor. Water? No, it fires. I'm so all a-fire, that I dare Not go amongst my flocks for fear; lest I should burn up all their pasture, if thou Dost not showre down some dew of Comfort to cool me. Car. I shall soon cool your courage, Doron; for I cannot, may not, will not love thee. Dor. Out you gossip, not love me? go, get You spin on Ixions wheel. Car. No, Lovers spin on that, and so must you. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 8. Enter Menaphon. Men. How fond was I, when I as vainly strove To keep my heart against the god of Love! I little thought his power; when I resolv'd To live, and not to love: Nature I see Cannot subsist without loves harmonie. In vain I shut the door, and bolted it With resolution; strait the thief, Thorough the casements of mine eyes got in, And stole away my heart; as once of old He serv'd the merry Greek Anacreon; Whose fancie fits my fortune: Here it is. Loves Duel. Cupid all his Arts did prove, To invite my heart to love; But I alwayes did delay, His mild summons to obey; Being deaf to all his charms. Strait the god assumes his Arms. With his bow and quiver, he Takes the field to Duel me. Armed like Achilles, I, With my shield alone defie His bold challenge, as he cast His golden darts, I as fast Catch'd his Arrows in my shield, Till I made him leave the field. Fretting, and disarmed then, The angry god returns agen, All in flames; 'stead of a dart, Throws himself into my heart. Useless, I my shield require, When the Fort is all on fire. I in vain the field did win, Now the Enemy's within. Thus betray'd, at last I cry, Love thou hast the victory. Alas! what heart's so fortify'd, to prove The sev'ral batteries of the god of love! What ear's not charm'd with th'rethorick of a voice, Whose single note would silence all the Quire Of the AÃ«rial feather'd Choristers! What eye would not be blinded to behold Those eyes which cast a cloud upon the Sun, And bring his light under disparagement. Enter Sephestia. Witness that face, whose Shrine hath made me blind. How fares my fairest guest? Seph. The better for Your courteous entertainment, may the gods Be favourable to your flocks, as you Have friendly been to us. Men. May I presume To crave your name, and to enquire how Hard-hearted fortune could be so unjust, To injure innocence? Signe she is blind. Seph. My name is Samela, my parentage But mean, the wife of a poor Gentleman Of Cyprus, now deceas'd: How arriv'd here, Pray do not now enquire; time may reveal, What present sorrows force me to conceal. Men. I will not press your yet fresh bleeding wounds, With a rude hand; 'tis time and patience Must work the cure; the gods allow a salve For ev'ry sore, but we must wait on them: Their time is best; for when we strive to heal Our wounds too fast, they do but fester more. Rest here content; a Country life is safe, Fortune o're-looks our humble cottages We are not pain'd with wealth, nor pin'd with want, Our sheep do yield us milk for food, and wooll To make us cloaths; hunger &amp; cold we slight: Envie hath here no place, we'l friendship keep, Free from all jars, and harmless as our sheep. Sam. O happy life! would I had never known Other than this, which by comparison, Renders mine odious to my memorie. Exit weeping. Men. Sorrow sits heavy on her heart, but shews More lovely in her face; those tears appear Like chrystal dew upon the blushing rose. Beauty thus veil'd, is more inviting, than Shining out in it's unclouded splendor. Fortune, I hate thee, for thy spight to her, But thank thee for thy courtesie to me, In sending her for shelter to my house. Kind love assist me now, and I will be Her constant servant, and thy votarie. Exit. Finis Act. 2.</field>

Kin. Look that for time to come ye honest be, And for what's past we freely pardon ye. Rom. Thanks, Royal Sir, the remnant of our lives VVill we spend in your service, and so give Again, our lives which you have given us, VVhen they were forfeit to your laws and you. Exeunt. Kin. This is a welcome gift. VVhat a divine Beautie doth sparkle in his countenance! Surely he cannot be of mortal race Descended, but Jove himself hath sent him, To be the happy heir of my Kingdom. Immortal Jove! I thank thee for this gift. Thou couldest not have sent a welcomer. My pretty lad, where wer't thou born? canst tell? Plu. I know not, Sir,âmy name is Plusidippus. Kin. Come, follow me, now have I found at once An husband for my daughter, &amp; an heir For the Thessalian Crown. Thrones are supplied By Jove, who, when the root is withered, Can make more heav'nly branches to sprout forth, Which may in time grow mighty trees to shade, And shelter all their liege-subjects under. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 2. Menaphon solus. Strike home, great Cupid, with thy flaming dart, As yet thou dost but dally with my heart: 'Tis rather scratch'd than wounded; I do hate A luke-warm love: give me a love flames high, As it would reach the element of fire, From whence it came; a low and creeping flame Befits a chimney, not a lovers breast. Give me a love dare undertake a task VVould fright an Hercules into an ague. A love dare tempt the boldest fate, and die An honour'd captive, or bold conquerour. Give me a daring, not a whining love, A love grows great with opposition: A love that scorns an easie task, things great And noble always are most difficult This is the love (blind Cupid) I would have, A love that brings home trophies, or a grave. I'll tempt his god-ship with a song, and see If verse, not sighs, will gain the victorie. 1. No more, no more, Fond Love give o're, Dally no more with me; Strike home and bold, Be hot, or cold, Or leave thy deitie. 2. In love, luke-warm, Will do more harm, Than can feavers heat: Cold cannot kill So soon as will A fainting, dying sweat. 3. I cannot tell, When sick, or well, Physick, or poyson give; Still in anguish, I do languish, Or let me die, or live. 4. If I must be, Thy Votarie, Be thou my friend or foe: If thou wilt have Me be thy slave, Hold fast, or let me goe. Sure Cupid hath resign'd his place, and giv'n His god-head unto Carmela, whose eyes Wound more than ever did his darts. But what is that, if she have power to hurt, And wanteth mercie for to heal those hurts. I fear whilst I make her my deitie, I do but thereby make her proud, And with my own hands place her out of reach. Yet she is in distress, and that should make Enter Doron. Listens and laughs. Her humble: I relieve her, therefore she Hath the more reason thus to relieve me; And certain, she will rather love than want. Dor. Ha, ha, ha, &amp;c. are you catch'd, Menaphon? I'faith, I think y'are fetter'd now, you'r hang'd Ith'brambles of love, as well as I. You laugh'd At me before, but now I'll laugh at you. Men. Ah Doron! now I crave thy pitie, for I never thought an earthly beautie could So soon have fetter'd me; what did I say? An earthly? No, Doron, she is heavenly, Brighter than PhÅbus in his glittring pride: Venus her self was not so fair a Bride. Do. How now Menaphon! I'm afraid thou wilt Be a beggar shortly, thou art a Poet already. One of the thred-bare crew, that ragged regiment. Enter Samela. Men. See Doron, see, see where she comes, who with Her brighter lustre can create a day At mid-night, when the Sun is gone to sleep; Eclipse his noon-tide glory with her light: Her absence would benight the world, &amp; cloath't In blackest darkness, for to mourn it's loss. Sam. Good-morrow Host, how thrive your well-fed flocks? Men. My flocks do thrive (Lady) and can't do less, Blest with the auspicious sun-shine of your eyes; And I were too ingrateful, if I should Deny to give you back again, what I Enjoy but by your beauteous influence. Sam. Y'are merry, Menaphon, if not prophane, To rob the gods of what is due to them, To give it to the object of their scorn. Could I dispense good fortunes, I should not Forget my self, &amp; chuse the meanest lot. Exeunt. Dor. This 'tis to be in love, how spruce is Menaphon Become of late, as he were always going To a feast? and talks as if he were some Citie Orator. Why can I not do so? I'm Sure I am in love as well as he. But I'll go hire some journey-man Poet, or other, And he shall make me some verses For my Carmela: And that will do as Well, as if I made them my self; I'll Set my brand upon them, and then no Body will question them to be mine, no More than they do my sheep that are mark'd. ScÃ¦n. 3. Enter Melecertus. Ay, ay, it shall be so. Oh Melecertus, Yonder is the finest shepherdess that ever The moon held the candle of her light to; the Shepherd Menaphon has got her to him, as If because he is the Kings shepherd, he Must have the Queen of Shepherdesses. Mel. Hast seen her, Doron? and dost know her name? Dor. Seen her? ay, and sigh to see her too; her name, I Think, is Stamelaâno, no,âSamela, Samela, Ay, ay, that's her name, I have it now, I would I had her too. Mel. What kind of woman is she, canst thou tell? Dor. Ay, or else I were naught to keep sheep. Mel. Can thy tongue paint her forth to mine ear? Dor. Ay, ay, legible, I warrant you. Her eyes are like two diamonds, I think, for I never saw any before; and her locks are All gold, like the golden fleece our shepherds Tell of. Mel. It were good vent'ring for that golden fleece, Doron, as Jason long since did for his. Dor. Her hands are all ivory, like the bone-haft Of my best knife, her alablaster, and her Eyes black as my blackest lamb, her cheeks Like roses red and white that grow together. What think you of her now? have I not made A fair picture on her? Mel. Ay Doron, were this picture painted to The life, as thou hast here described it, It could not chuse but make an absolute, Rare, and compleat piece of deformitie. Dor. Nay, nay, if you don't like it, I don't Care, but I had it out of an old book of My brother Moron's, they call 'm Rogue-mances, I think: my brother Ha's a whole tumbrel full on 'm, he's Such a Bookish block-headâ Mel. Nay, be not angry, Doron, I believe Thou mean'st a beautie beyond expression: And such an one I had, till envious fate Rob'd me of her, and all my joyes at once, Heavens envying at my happiness, Sent death to fetch her from me, and she's dead, Dead, Doron, dead,âshe's dead to me, and to The world, and all but to my memorie. weeps. Dor. Fie, Melecertus, what dost mean to Weep? what, wilt thou make dirt of Her ashes with thy teares? Mel. Well, Doron, we forget our flocks, and we Shall miss the shepherds merry meeting. Dor. That's true, and there will be the shepherdesses Too, and Menaphon will bring his fine Mistris thither; there shalt thou see her, But first mask thine eyes, lest thou lose Them, and become love-blind, as I am. Good Melecertus take the pains to lead me. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 4. Enter King Damocles melancholy, 2 Lords. Kin. How wretched am I grown, I hate my self, And care not now for my own company: I loath thee light, and fain would hide my self From mine own eyes; I'm wearie of my life.â Where shall I hide my self, that there I may Deceive th'approaches of discov'ring day? I'll seek some gloomy cave, where I may lie, Entomb'd alive in shades of secrecie. Exit. 1 Lo. His thoughts are much perplex't, &amp; black despair, May push him on unto some desp'rate act, If not prevented by our vigilance. 2 Lo. This is th'effect of rash resolves, when hast And passion hurry men to do those things Reason would wish undone, at least delay'd. Our wills spur'd on by rage, ne're stop, till we (Blinded with anger) headlong throw our selves From dangers prÃ¦cipice, into a gulf Of black despairing thoughts; and then too late Repentance lends us so much light as may Shew us our madness, and our miserie. 1 Lo. Ill actions never go unpunished; They are their own tormentors, and do prove At last, furies to lash the guilty soul. 2 Lo. When reason is depos'd, &amp; passion reigns, Nothing but lawless actions do appear: When passion hath usurp't the helm, And steers a wild uncertain course, not by The card and compass of advice, the ship Will never make good voyage, but be tost Upon the waves, and all her lading lost. He by his wilful rage hath cast away Himself, and floats upon the waves of ruine: Let's try if we can waft him safe to shore, Lend him our helping hands, lest he do sink Into that deep and black gulf of despair. 1 Lo. Let's after him, and try what we can do, In saving him, we save our Kingdom too. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 5. Enter Menaphon, with Samela, and Pesana after them, Melecertus leading Doron. Pes. Hey day, what's here, my brother Doron? Mel. Doron conceits himself that he is blind. Dor. Ay, Doron's as blind as any door: what Creep I here upon? Carmila, oh Carmila, The very sight of thee hath recovered mine Eyes again. He stumbles on Samela in Carmila's cloaths. Men. Nay, now I see, Doron, th'art blind indeed, That dost not know Carmila from her cloaths. No, no, 'tis Samela, not Carmila. Dor. Which is my Carmila? good Melecertus. Shew me where she is. Mel. It seems, Doron, Carmila is not here. Dor. Why, what do I do here then? I thought It was something I miss'd, onely I Mistook; for I had thought it had Been my eyes were lost, but now I See it is my Carmila is missing, whom I had rather see than my own eyes. Pes. This is my corrival in Menaphon's love. Mel. She is a beautie indeed; and since my Sephestia is drown'd, without compare. I cannot blame Menaphon, but envie Him rather, for his so happy choise. O happy! yet to me unhappy beautie! That doth (as in a glass) present unto My frighted senses the remembrance of My loss, which, unless by this fair piece, Cannot be recompenced by the world.â Mistris, y'are welcome to our company. Dor. By my troth, Mistris, you are very welcome, As I may say, unto our meeting. Sam. Thanks shepherds: I am a bold intruder Into your company; but that I am Brought by your friend, and my host Menaphon. Mel. Mistris, your presence is Apologie Sufficient; yet do we owe him thanks, That by his means we have the happiness T'enjoy your sweet societie in this Our rural meeting, when shepherds use To cheer themselves with mirth &amp; pleasant tales. Sam. I hope my company shall not forbid The Banes between your meeting &amp; your mirth. Mel. Then by your leave, fair shepherdess, I will Begin with you. If the gods should decree To change your form, what shape would you desire? Sam. I would be careful how to sail between The two rocks, of immodest boldness, or Of peevish coyness; therefore to answer Unto your question, I would be a sheep. Men. A sheep? Mistris, why would you be a sheep? Sam. Because that then my life should harmless be, My food the pleasant Plains of Arcadie, My drink the curious streams, my walks Spacious, and my thoughts as free as innocent. Dor. I would I were your Keeper. Mel. But many times the fairest sheep are drawn Soonest unto the shambles to be kill'd. Sam. And sure a sheep would not repine at that, To feed them then, who fed her long before. Pes. Then there's more love in beasts, than constancie In men, for they will die for love, but when? When they can live no longer, not before. Men. If they'r so wise, it is their mother-wit, For men have their inconstancies but from You women, as the sea it's ebbs and tides Hath from the moon.âYour embleme to an hair. Dor. Menaphon, if you hate my sister, I'llâ Love yours for't in spight of your teeth. Pes. Your mother surely was a weather-cock, That brought forth such a changeling; for your love Is like the lightning, vanished as soon As it appears; a minute is an age In your affections. You once loved me.â Dor. Ay, I would you lov'd him no better. Men. If that I be so changing in my love, It is because mine eye's so weak a Judge, It cannot please my heart upon trial. Pes. If that your eye's so weak, then let your eares Be open to your loves appeals and plaints, Sam. Come, for to end this strife, pray let us hear Th'opinion of good Doron, who's so mute, As if h'had lost his tongue too, with his eyes. Dor. By my fay, fair Mistris, I was thinking All this while with my self, whether in being A sheep, you would be a ram, or an ewe? Sam. An ewe, no doubt; if I should change my shape, I would not change my Sex; and horns are held The heaviest burthen that the head can bear. Dor. I think then I were best be an ewe too, So I might be sure to have no horns: But I would not greatly care to wear horns, Were I a ram, were it but where you were An ewe.â Men. VVell, shepherds, come, the day declines, and gives Us timely warning for to fold our flocks. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 6. Manet Melecertus. VVere my Sephestia living, I should think This sheperdess were she: Such was her shape, Such was her countenance; her very voice Doth speak her my Sephestia. But alas! How fondly do I dream! I do embrace A cloud in stead of Juno. Yet I love, And like her, 'cause she is so like my Love. VVe love the pictures of our absent friends: And she's the living picture of my dear, My dear Sephestia. Me thinks I feel A kind of sympathy within my brest, To like and love her of all women best. Forgive me, my Sephestia, if thou livest, If I do love another for thy sake: Thy likeness is the loadstone which doth draw My heart to her, that nothing else could move. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 7. Enter Pesana. Thou most impartial deitie of Love! Can there be two Suns in Loves Hemisphere? Or more loves in one heart than one that's true? Or can the stream of true love run in more Channels than one? Shall I be thus paid For my love to false Menaphon? Hereafter, Venus, never will I adore thee, nor Will I offer up so many Evening Prayers unto Cupid, as I have done.â Was ever poor maid so rewarded with An inconstant lover, as I daily am With this same fickle-headed Menaphon! Enter Doron. How now Pesana! what's the newes with thee? Pes. News! marry 'tis the news I complain of; Were Menaphon the old Menaphon, that He was wont to be, I should not complain. Dor. Comeâplain. Pesana must not grutch to give Way unto fine Samela, that hath turn'd his Heart, and if he do not turn again Quickly, he'l be burnt on that side; well, Be content a while, by that time he hath loved Her, as long as he did thee, he'l be as Weary of her, as he is now of thee. Pes. But in the mean time, Doron, I must be A stale to her usurps my right in him. Dor. Ay, that's the reason he doth not care For thee, because thou art stale. Thus do poor lovers run through The briars and the brambles of difficulties, And sometimes fall into the ditch of undoing. Pes. Good Doron, be my friend to Menaphon. And mind him of his former love to me, Or I shall learn at last to slight him too. Dor. Ay, ay, he has a sister, just such another As himself, I'm zure she has e'en broken My poor heart in twain; and if it be Piec'd again, it will never be handsom. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 8. Enter Lamedon. How happy are these shepherds! here they live Content, and know no other cares, but how To tend their flocks, and please their Mistris best. They know no strife, but that of love, they spend Their days in mirth; and when they end, sweet sleeps Repay, and ease the labours of the day. They need no Lawyers to decide their jars, Good herbs, and wholsom diet, is to them The onely Ãsculapius; their skill Is how to save, not how with art to kill. Pride and ambition are such strangers here, They are not known so much as by their names. Their sheep and they contend in innocence, Which shall excell, the Master or his flocks. With honest mirth, and merry tales, they pass Their time, and sweeten all their cares: Whilst Courts are fill'd with waking thoughtful strife, Peace and content do crown the shepherds life.

Daughter, it is enough, we will it, see You shew your dutie in obeying us; Since I have made choise of him for my Son, Accept him for your husband: He's a man Ancient in virtues, although young in yeares: He's one whose worth is far beyond his age. Eur. Father, it grieves me that the cross Fates have Forc'd me to hate the man you so much love: Cupid hath struck me with his leaden dart, I cannot force my own affections. Kin. How's this? you hate him whom I love! can he Be th'object of your hate, who is alone The subject of my love and reverence? He whom the gods in mercie have design'd The happy Successor unto my crown, And to your love? Bethink your self again. Eur. Great Sir, the gods themselves are subject to That little deitie of love, can I Withstand his power, or love against his will? Force cannot work on love, which must be free, And uncompell'd, else can it not be true, Nor lasting. Sir, urge me no more in vain. Kin. What a strange change is here! Your will was wont Freely to stoop to all my just desires; Is it now grown so stiff, 'twill not be bent By my commands? I know thou dost but feign. Eur. I would obey your will, could I command Mine own affections, or chuse my love. Kin, Do it, or else by Jove, whom I present, I'll punish thy neglect.âI cannot think Thy words and thoughts agree. Surely to love, Is natural, why then not to love him, Whom nature made to be belov'd? He hath Artillery enough about him to take in The stoutest heart at the first summons.âWell, Think on't Euriphila, when I am gone, I'll leave thee here, Lovers are best alone. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 2. Eur. How rarely have I play'd this part, &amp; hid My love under a mask of hate!âbut now, Me thinks, I feel the fire of love to rage More fiercely in my breast; for being kept So close, it will break out too soon: I must Invert the course of love, and woo him first. Enter Plusidippus. He comes, and fitly: Cupid, instruct me now, To war and conquer in this bloodless fight, That wins the field by flight, and not by force. Yet must I veil my love still, and seem coy, Till by a false retreat I make him fall Into those snares I set, and wish him in.â What means this bold intrusion? do'st befit You to intrude into my privacies? Plu. Lady, the fault's not mine, fortune hath led Me to this place: mine ignorance (I hope) Will plead mine innocence. As I have found Your Royal Fathers noble favours far Exceed my hopes, or my requital, let Not your frownes strike dead whom he hath rais'd To life; crueltie cannot lodge within That tender breast was onely made for Love. Eur. Dare you presume to talk of love to me? Am I a mate, fit for your choice? Be gone, And seek some shrub may fit your lowness best. Plu. Madam, this storm becomes you not. It is Degenerate from your noble Fathers strain. I cannot think this should proceed from one, That is the Heir to his name and worth. Eur. My fathers ears shall ring with this, that he Hath warm'd a viper, which would bite him now, And entertain'd a guest would rob his host. Plu. Lady, my spirit tels me that my birth Is not so base as you conceit. I mean To try my spirit, and my fortunes in Mars his Camp, but not in Venus Courts. Since nature's so unkind, as not to let Me know what honour I was born unto, I'll win some to my name, by actions, which Shal speak me noble; I had thought t'have made You the fair goddess at whose shrine I meant T'have offer'd up, and sacrific'd my self, And all my services; but cause you prove So rough, I will not harbour here, but seek The world through, for an altar worthy of My labours. So, fair proud, farewel. Exit. Eur. Art gone! I did not well to tempt a part I knew not how to act, to hide a flame I could not well conceal: for hereby have I drove him quite away.âEuriphila, Thou wer't too blame.âWell, I will after him, And try if I can fetter him with gifts, Whom love cannot entangle: Mars is his god, Not Venus; once more will I try, and shew Him plainly how I love him: Juno help, And thou, O little deitie of Love. Besiege the castle of his stubborn breast, Bend all thy batteries unto his heart, Make it the mark of all thy golden darts. Let him no more resist, but know thy power, That Mars with all his armour, nor his forts, Castles, or coats of mail, can fence him from Thy little piercing shafts, which wound unseen. And I will try what work a womans arts Can make against these stubborn warriors hearts. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 3. Enter Samela. I have but one heart to bestow, and that Must not be Menaphon's; mine eyes do fix On Melecertus, the best counterfeit Of my lost Maximus: I cannot yet Think on that name, but it doth seem to chide My hasty choise, and drown my love in tears. She weeps. Enter Menaphon. Men. What mean these sudden passions, Samela? Hast thou not here all thou canst wish? what dost Thou want can make one happy, but content? Sam. 'Tis true, I nothing want, that a poor wretch Can wish for; but this happiness doth mind Me of my fore-past happiness that's lost. Is't possible the vein of true love can Be broken, and the wound not bleed afresh At every thought! Alas! my heart's so full Of tears and grief, that some will over-flow. Men. Had thy tears power to raise the dead again, Then were they lawful and commendables But since that tears are fruitless, and your friends (Like water spilt) now past recoverie, It is but folly to weep for the dead. Pursue no more fled joyes, turn and receive Those comming pleasures which do court your hand To take them. If thou wilt listen to my loveâ Sam. I like my grief much better than thy love. Men. Why so nice and coy fair Lady Prethee why so coy? If you deny your hand and lip Can I your heart enjoy? Prethee why so coy? For thy flitting joyes are past, I will give thee joyes at last. Joyes that shall create each other, Make thee both a wife and mother. Sam. Y're merry, Menaphon, but I can't joyn In consort with you. Seek some other mate; I have no heart to give, nor hand to take Your gift. Another reaps what you have sown, And like t'enjoy what you have hop'd in vain. Men. Another reap what I have sown! Is this Your gratitude you so much boasted of? Have I supplied your wants with plenty, and With scorn do you repay my charitie? Did I relieve you in distress for this?â By Pan, the god of shepherds, or return Love for my love, or be turn'd out of doors. Sa. My heart ne're knew what baseness meant, Of thankful thoughts for your civilities; (it's full If those will satisfie, I'll employ all Th'exchequer of my breast; but as for love, Alas! that is not in my power to give. Men. I saw your loose eyes at the shepherds feast, Rov'd every where, but Melecertus was The mark they aym'd at most. Well, get you gone, Expect no more from me, but slight and scorn. Exit. Sam. My grief was ominous, and did presage This sad mishap; was I not cross'd enough Before? when will my suff'rings have an end! Well, I'll go seek my Uncle Lamedon, The comfort and companion of my woes. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 4. Enter Euriphila. Love bids me go, but reason bids me stay; Reason! thou hast no share in love; I'll on. Love is a passion, passions know no lawes, The gods themselves cannot be wise and love. Enter Plusidippus passing by. Friend Plusidippus, hark, who would have thought You so faint-hearted, that a maidens frowns, Could turn the edge of your affections? Plu. No, madam, but your scorn hath whet the edge Of my resolves, to seek some other clime May prove more temperate: Arcadia is The place I aym at, where, I'm told, there dwels A Lady of that beautie, that the world Can't shew her second; thither am I bound. Eur. You do but jest, I hope, I'm sure I did No other; for I love thee with my heart, Offers him gifts. And may these signs confirm it that I do. Plu. I must not dwell at these signs, well I may Bait for a while, but cannot make a stay. Arcadia is the place I visit must, That is the center whereunto I rend, And where my labours hope to find an end. Eur. What, must a Lady wooe you to accept Her favours? Come, what need hast thou to seek Offers him her gifts again. Dangers, and love abroad, who hast at home The onely daughter of a King, who courts Thee for thy love? what mean those silent looks? Hear me, my Plusidippus: what, still mute? Plu. Th'attractive of that beautie I have seen But in a picture will not let me rest, Until I see that creature so divine, Arcadia is blest withal, to be The happy casket of so rich a jewel. Eur. By all the love thou ow'st my fathers care, I do adjure thee to stay here with me, And in mine arms I'll lodge thee until time Shall make thee King of Thessaly; mean-while Let me be happy in th'enjoyment of Thy companie, and seek not toils and care, When thou mayst live more happy here, than thou Canst wish or find in any other place. Plu. My Genius prompts me, that I must not rest Here, for the gods do seem to call me hence, And their decrees I may not break, nor will. Exit. Eur. This scorn tormenth me, yet can I not Repay his hate with hate; but I do love Him more. Love, this is tyrannie in thee. Enter Agenor King. Here comes my Father, may his newes be good. Kin. Now forward girle, did I for this provide An husband for you? do you thus reward My love to you, to slight him whom I love? Your scornes will force him from our Court to flie. And now I hear, he'l to Arcadia. Eur. Believe it, Sir, 'tis far from me to wish, Or be the cause of his departure hence. Kin. Yes, yes, your peevishness I hear's the cause, Nay, I my self have heard, with shame to think You so much scorn'd a man, I so much lov'd. Did I grace him, that you should disgrace him? Eur. Great Sir, the greatest loss is mine; &amp; none Can tell with what an heavy heart I shall Be forc'd to part with him. And therefore, if You please to use your power to stay him here, You may so be my father the second Time, by preserving the life you gave me, Which, without his presence, is nothing worth. As you tender the life of a daughter, Or the welfare of a maid, endeavour His stay, or I shall follow him to death.â Kin. I'll find him out and try what power I have Upon him: I suppose my kindnesses To him, may well deserve his acceptance, They have not been such as should wearie him, Nor is a Crown a thing to be slighted, Nor easily obteined; yet his stay May purchase mine, and 'tis an easie rate. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 5. Enter Lamedon, Samela. Lam. What, Neece, still weeping? cannot curing time Invent a plaister for thy wounds, but that They still thus bleed afresh? what is the cause? Sam. Dearest Uncle! who hitherto have been The onely Partner and Physician Of all my griefs; unless your skill can fit A cure unto my present cares, I must Yeild to their strength, for with continued Batteries they so assault me now, that I must be forc'd to sink under their weight. Lam. Why, what new cross hath hapned unto thee? That thus renews thy grief? Come, tell it me; And doubt not of my readiness to trie All means for thy relief; but first 'tis fit I know the cause, the first step to the cure. Unbosome then thy grief, and give it vent; Is Menaphon as kind as he was wont? Sam. That name it is that is my sorrows spring From whence these tears do flow, 'tis he aloneâ Unkind and false, base-minded Menaphon.â Lam. Out with it all, and tell me how he hath Abused thee, and I will try to right Thee, and requite him for his injuries. Sam. When as he saw I would not satisfie His foolish fancie, for which cause alone He hitherto hath entertained us, And not for to relieve our wants; he sees His hopes are frustrated, and I despise His clownish love, he turn'd me out of's doors: Where shall we lie? we are expos'd unto The mercie of the kinder elements; The heavens must be our canopie, and th'earth Our bed, the poor flocks our companions. Lam. Well, fear not, Samela, already I Have found a way to ease thy mind; I have A little money left, and there withal Soon shall I purchase a small flock for thee: Where thou shalt live secure, and free from fear, Enjoy thy little with content; there is A shepherd lately dead, whose flock I'll buy, And thou shalt be it's Mistris, Samela. Sam. Uncle, my thanks shall ever ready be For you, as always is your care for me. But let your haste prevent my comming griefs, For griefs have wings, wherewith they flie to us, Comforts are leaden-heel'd, and move but slow. Lam. Fear not, I will dispatch it suddenly, The shepherd Doron's brother's lately dead. And he hath the disposal of the flock, As soon as I can find him, we will try If reasonable price will make them ours, Enter Doron. See where he comes preventing me; Doron, The merry shepherd! whither away so fast? Dor. I'm running for my life, Sir, my brother's Lately dead, and I'm afraid death will catch Me too, if I don't make haste. I'm sure Carmela has half cut the thred of my Life in twain, with the hook of her crueltie; Besides, Moron's sheep are roving to find Their master, and they'l go till they lose Themselves, if I find them not the sooner. Lam. Moron! what was he a kin to a fool? Dor. Why he was my own brother, Sir. Lam. I thought so. Dor. I must be gone. Lam. Nay, stay Doron, what wilt thou take, and we Will ease thee of the trouble of thy sheep. Dor. By my troth Sir, and you shall have them, but What will you give me, and you shall have His flock,âay and me too, if you will, for I think Carmela won't. Gives him gold. Lam. Will these content thee for thy sheep? Dor. Ay marry, this is something likâyou Shall have them Sir, were there as many Of them as there are hairs on their Backs.âThey talk of a golden fleece, But I think I have made their fleeces Gold now. Come Sir, I'll deliver you the sheep. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 6. Enter Menaphon. Forlorn, forsaken, and the object made Of all the shepherds storms! what shall I do? Love is no god, Fortune is blind, and can Not help; sleep flies, and cares possess my head. Mirth makes me melancholy, company Yields me no comfort: when I am alone, A thousand fancies do distract my thoughts: And when I try to drown my cares in wine, They swim aloft, and will be uppermost. I'll try if I can sing my cares asleep. Ye restless cares, companions of the night, That wrap my joyes in clouds of endless woes, Spare not my heart, but wound it with your spight, Since love and fortune prove my equal foes. Farewel my hopes, farewel my happy dayes, Welcom sweet grief, the subject of my layes. Enter Pesana. Pes. Now will I take time by the fore-lock, and Creep into Menaphon's breast, through the cracks His minion Samela has made in it. Aside. Friend Menaphon, what is your courage cool'd? Men. Cold entertainment hath my courage cool'd. Pes. You know where you might have been let in, long E're this, without assault or batterie. But you'r serv'd in your kind, for being coy: Now you have met with your mate (friend) I hope. Men. She set my heart on fire by her presence, That will not be put out by her absence. Pes. Then I see you mean to follow her with Your suit and service still, for all her scorn. Men. No, she hath wounded me too deep, to make Pursuit after her, therefore let her go. Pes. Now then you know what 'tis to be slighted; So once you slighted me, now I'll slight you. Exit. Men. Ah cruel love! whose musick is compos'd Of Lovers jars an discords, mixt with sighs! If I turn traytor once more unto love, I'll rob him of his deitie, and pull His little Kingdom down; I'll pull his wings, And with the quils made into pens, and dipt In saddest lovers tears, in stead of ink, I'll Satyres write against his tyrannie. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 7. Enter King Agenor, Plusidippus, and Euriphila. Kin. Why then, my Plusidippus, will you leave Us, and your fortunes? It is my resolve To make you heir to my crown, my Son And Successor. Plu. Great Sir, I would not be Fondly injurious to my self, or you, Or so prophane unto the gods, to slight Their and your gifts, when proffer'd me so fair: I must obey their dictates, and my vowes, Which call me to Arcadia, till when, I cannot rest. Give me your Royal leave To go, I will engage my hopes, and all My future happinesses, to return In so short a time as you shall limit me. Kin. Then daughter, since it must be so, I can Not tell how to denie his just request: But see you part with him in friendship. And The like Sir, I require of you to her. Exit. Plu. Far be it from me to denie so fair Requests. Lady, in signe hereof, I take This parting kiss, and may it cancel all Miscarriages; and seal Loves covenants. And thus I take my leave but for a while. Eur. Then take thee this my dearest heart, and bear It with thee; may it be a charm to keep Thy chaste affections from a Strangers love: May your return shorten my tedious hours, Since I neglect mine own content for yours. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 8. Enter 2 Lords. 1 Lo. It seems our Kink hath pretty well outgrown His griefs; and now he meditates new Loves. 2 Lo. The fire of love hath thaw'd his frozen breast, And turn'd his cold December into May: His Scepter's chang'd into a sheep-hook, He Is gone on pilgrimage to seek a wife Amongst the shepherdesses; there is one Whom I have seen, and he is gone to see, May vie with Juno for precedencie: Who in the habit of a Country lass, Carries a Prince-like countenance and grace. In th'Arcadian Plains she keeps a flock Of sheep, whose innocence and whiteness she Surpasseth, whilst the shepherds daily strive VVho shall bid fairest for this fairer prize. 1 Lo. And he'l out-bid them all, if that will do. But what a motley mixture will it be, To see his grey hairs joyned with her green And springing youth? The strange effects of love! VVell may she be his nurse, but not his wife. VVhat's love in young, is dotage in old men. 2 Lo. Love can create an Autumn Spring, infuse New spirits in the old, and make them young Besides, Honour's a bait frail women know Not to resist: who would not be a Queen? Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 9. Enter Samela. Once more doth Fortune flatter me, with hopes Of a contented life: now am I free From jealous Menaphon's suspitions, And without fear enjoy my wished love. Enter Melecertus. See where he comes, the picture drawn to th'life Of my dead Maximus, my former joy. Mel. All hail unto the fairest Samela, And to her happy flock: I envie them She is their Mistris, I her servant am. Long since my heart was hers, may she but please To take that kindly, which I freely give. Sam. But, Melecertus, can I hope to find You real unto me, whose worth I know Cannot but be engag'd already to Some more deserving creature than poor I. Mel. Lady, my services were never due To any, but to one, which bond harsh death Hath cancelled to make me yours alone. Sam. You call death harsh for freeing you from them, And would you be in the like bonds again? Mel. Your heavenly likeness doth compel me to't You are the same, but in another dress. Let me no longer therefore strive to win That fort, I so much covet to be in. Sam. Then Melecertus take thy Samela. Mel. Oh happy word! oh happy fate! the gods If they would change with me, should give me odds. Finis Act. 4.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter King Damocles, like a Shepherd. Thus Jove chang'd shapes to satisfie his love, He laid his god-head by; my Kingdome I Have lot a time forsaken, and exchang'd My royal robes for shepherds weeds. How light (Me thinks) I feel my self! having laid by My crown, with its companions heavy cares! Enter Plusidippus. But who comes here? His paces to me tend. Plu. Shepherd, well met, but why without a flock? What, hath the rot consum'd thy sheep? or are They gone astray? Kin. No, not my sheep, but I, Aside. So far, I almost know not where, or what I am;âto seek, as yet I know not whom. Plu. This old man dotes, and knows not what he sayes; Where is thy bag-pipe, and thy merry layes, That shepherds use to have in readiness? Surely thou art no shepherd, but some goat Crept lately into a sheeps habit.âDost Thou know the field of the fair Samela? Kin. This boy will be my Rival, for that name Aside. Sounds like the creatures that I seek for.âNo, Go seek your Stamela, I know no such. Plu. This is intolerable,âI will scourge Draws. Enter Samela passing by. Thee into better manners.âBut that divine Appearance makes my spirits calm, and strikes An awful reverence into my breast. This is the beautie of th'Arcadian Plains, Sh'has shot her rayes so home into my heart, But partial fame was niggardly and base, In giving but a glimpse of this rare beautie. Sam. D'you know me, Sir, or have you lost your way? Plu. I cannot likely lose my way, where I Do find such glistring goddesses as you. Indeed the force of such a light, may rob Me of the office of mine eyes, and make Them dark with too much brightness; can I chuse But gaze upon the Sun, when first I see't. Sam. I think you lost your wits, or else your eys, That you mistake a glo-worm for the sun, And make a goddess of a shepherdess. Plu. Lady, if I have lost my wits or eyes, It was with seeking you, whose beautie drew Me hither; for your sake alone have I Shook hands with Thessaly, and all my friends, Onely to joyn my hands and heart with you. Sam. I should be loth to give my hand unto So sudden a conclusion, and my heart Is neither in my power or possession. Plu. Fair Shepherdess, my errand is in love, To yield my heart into your hands; 'tis yours, By gift and conquest; I'm at your command. Sam. If that you are at my command, be gone, I cannot, will not listen to your words. Exit. Plu. And have I left my dear Euriphila For this! I see beautie makes women proud, I would I were at Thessaly again, There should I welcome be unto Euriphila, Whose heart I know's my fellow-traveller, Her salt tears, by this time, would make a sea, Wherein I might swim back again with ease. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 2. Kin. I see this youth's repul'st, and he is young And stout, and well deserving, how shall I Hope to prevail with her? if lively youth She do despise, then much more cripling age: Nor do I know what arguments to use, Unless to tell her that I am a King, And lay my Crown and Scepter at her feet, Which she will scarce believe: my shepherds hook Will not be taken for a scepter, nor This poor cap for th'usurper of a crown.â I have a way whereby to work my will, And this young man shall be my instrument: There stands a castle hard by, whither he Perforce shall carry her. I'll work my will Upon her, when I have her there confin'd. Enter Plusidippus. Plu. I will revenge this scorn, if force or wit Will do, I'll make her pride come down. Kin. Be wise, Young man, and valiant, and I will tell Thee how thou shalt obtein thy full desire. Plu. But tell me how, and then let me alone To act, what e're it be. Kin. A Castle stands Near by, guarded with crows and negligence, Thither thou mayst by force convey her, and Then force her unto what entreaties can't. Plu. Old man, if I do gain her by thy means, Thou shalt not want reward: I know the place Where she doth tend her flock, and I'l watch her, As she doth them; and when I see my time, I will convey her where you shall direct. Exit. Kin. I will attend you here.âNow must I plot To get her in my power, and then I shall Advance her to a crown against her will. But yet, I cannot think Honour should need An Advocate; womens ambitious thoughts Do swim aloft, they love to be above Their neighbours, envying ev'ry one whose height Doth over-look, and seemeth to upbraid Their lowness by comparison; their minds Are always climbing up to honours hill, And pride, and self-conceit, are the two wings Which elevate their thoughs to flie aloft. Enter Plusidippus, with Samela. Plu. Now, Mistris Coy, y'are not in your own power, But mine. Old shepherd, take thee charge of her. Exit. Kin. Lady, you see what folly 'tis for you To denie men what they can take without Your leave. Now must you yield unto the Knight Of Thessaly.âBut if you will be wise, And see a good when proffer'd, you may be A Queen, by granting of my suit, who am King of Arcadia, although thus disguis'd. Sam. My father Damocles 'tis he now sues aside. To me his dauughter: He's incestuous grown. Kin. This is too woman-like, to turn away From your own happiness.âAnd it is strange, That honour doth not tempt her; thou shalt have A Crown and Kingdom at thy sole command, And change these rural weeds for princely robes, If thou wilt be my wife, pleasure for pain, And plenty for thy povertie. What sayst? Sam. Your potent batteries, and golden baits Might win (perhaps) on some ambitious soul: They nothing move me, to remove my love Already plac'd on Melecertus, He, He onely doth, and shall possess my heart. Kin. A shepherd. Shall a shepherds basnesse stand In competition, and out-weigh a King? A subject be before his Sovereign Prefer'd? Oh how prepostrous are the minds Of these fond women! Come, be well advis'd, And change that pettie pebble for a pearl. 'Tis in my power to make thee happy, or With one breath to blast the flower of thy hopes. And to repay thy folly with thy shame. Do not go on to kindle such a fire Within my breast, as shall consume both thee, And all that cross the current of my will. Sam. I have already sad experience of The wilde effects of his enraged will, aside. Yet such the crosness of my fortune is, I must again be made the subject of His furious tyrannie; but I'm resolv'd. Know Sir, I value more my minds content, Than all the gawdie shows Courts can present: I am too well confirmed in the bliss, And sweet content attends a Country life, To leave it for the giddy-headed Court. Besides, my true affections are so riveted Unto my Melecertus, that nor frowns, Nor flatteries shall part my heart from him. Cease therefore farther to commence a suit Nature forbids me grant, and you to ask. Kin. And have I with my Kingly robes laid by My Kingly mind? No, it shall ne're be said A womans will hath contradicted mine. But 'tis by policie that I must work, Since I have laid my Kingly power aside, I'll set my brains o'th'tenter hooks, and stretch Them to their uttermost abilities, To win this scornful beautie to my wife, Or else revenge it with her dearest life. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 3. Sam. My life hath hitherto been chequer'd with Varietie of fortunes; sometimes with A white of happiness, and then a black Of miserie; thus loves bright day of mirth, Is follow'd with a darker night of woe. How fair of late my fortune seem'd to be, And now, alas! o're-cast with blackest clouds Of discontents, wherein I labour with Important suits, I cannot, may not grant. No, no, my Melecertus, I am firm To thee, nor shall the rain of tears, Or winds of threats remove me from thy love. Be thou but constant, nay, I know thou art, I will not wrong thee with so foul a thought, As once to doubt thou canst be otherwise. Enter Plusidippus. Plu. You're from your shepherds now, or their defence, Presume not they can rescue you, 'tis past Their skill or power, to force you from mine arms. Sam. Alas, fond boy! I scorn thy threats, as much As I hate thee, or slight thy boasted strength. Were but my Melecertus here, he would Whip thy rudeness into better manners. Plu. 'Tis well you are a woman (not a man,) And have no other weapon but your tongue, Which you are priviledg'd to use, and we To laugh at. But in short, if you'l accept My love and service, then shall you be safe, And happy: Souldiers cannot talk, but with Their swords, and then they strike gain-sayers dumb. Sam. All this is nothing; for your words, nor swords Shall not remove me from my dearest friend, He hath my heart, and I have nothing left But hate, if you'l accept of that, 'tis all That I can give, or you receive from me. Plu. You must be dealt with as we use to do With sullen birds, I'll shut you up, and then Perhaps you'l sing another note, you are Not yet in tune, you are too high for me, But I will take you lower. I will plough Your heart with grief, and then (perhaps) it will Better receive the seed of my true love. Sam. Sooner the turtle shall forget her mate, Than I my Melecertus; and when I Can't see him with mine eys, my mind shall rove, Wing'd with desire, throughout the spacious world, And find no rest, until it meet with him. And though our bodies never meet, our souls Shall joyn, and love each other after death. Thus is true love immortal, and shall never Die, but with our souls shall live for ever. Plu. Shepherd, who e're thou art, I cannot chuse But envie thee thy happiness, who hast So true a love: I cannot but admire This noble soul and love her, though she hate Me for't; I'll treat her civilly, and if I can't obtain her for a wife, she shall My goddess be, and I'll adore her name, Though at a distance. Lady, will you walk? Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 4. Enter King Damocles. It is an ill wind that blows no man good; Though the Thessalian lad have got the prize In his possession, it shall not be long, But I will have them both in mine, I have Dispatch'd a letter to my Lords, to send Me suddenly some servants to assist Enter Menaphon. My plot. Now Menaphon, what is the newes? Men. Great Sir, the messenger's return'd, and brought The men you sent for, they are here at hand. Kin. 'Tis well; direct them to the castle that I told you of, and give them charge to seize Upon the buzzard and his prey, and bring Them both to me: mean-time go you, and find Out Melecertus, that I may be sure Of him, for he's my rival in my love. Men. My Liege, all shall be done to your desire. Exit. Kin. Blest policie, thou far exceed'st dull strength, That wanders in the dark of ignorance, Wanting the eye of wisedome, both to guide, And to defend it from approaching harms. Thus art with ease doth move the pondrous load, Which strength could never master, or remove. The Foxes tail must piece the Lions skin. Little Ulysses with his wit did more Against the foe, than Ajax with his strength. Exit ScÃ¦n. 5. Enter Samela. It is some comfort yet that I can change My prison, though I am a pris'ner still, Would I could change my companie as soon. But ah! most wretched Samela, who wert Born to misfortunes, and to nothing else: As if that I alone were fortunes mark, At which she onely ayms her angry darts. The morning of mine age was clouded with Mishaps, and now my noon is like to be The fatal night unto my miserie.â My Gaoler is so kind, as if he meant To bribe my love; but these are gilded pills I cannot swallow. Should my Father get Me into his possession once again, I were as bad, or worse: I know too well His passion, to hope any help from him. I'll tell him plainly who I am, and trie If time have dull'd the edge of's crueltie: Perhaps the kinder gods may move his heart To pitie, and convert his rage to love. He is my father still, and though unkind To me, yet can I not forget I am His child, and owe a dutie to his name. He is my King, and so I must obey His will; if I must suffer, let it be From his, rather than from a strangers hands. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 6. Enter Doron, reading. I think I am provided now, if Poetrie Will do't, my Carmila is mine; these Wittie knaves, what fine devices they Have got to fetter maidens hearts? The Poet Orpheus made the Thracian Dames dance after his pipe, and Ovid Charm'd the Emperours daughter with His Poetrie; there are some secret Enter Carmila. Charms in these same verses sure. Let me see here what I have got. Ha Carmila, look here, I think You'l love me now. Reads. CarmilaâA Miracle. Car. A miracle, for what, Doron? Dor. Why, a miracle of beautie, and I think You'l be a miracle of folly, if you Don't love me now. Car. What small Poet have you hired To make a miracle of my name. Dor. Nay, I have more yet, and better, That I found in the Nichodemus Of Complements, that's a sweet book, 'Tis a very magazine of Poetrie, a Store-house of wit; do but hear Them Carmila. Car. Let's hear them, Doron, are they Worth a laughing at? Let's hear. Dor. Well, well, it is no laughing matter; but I'm Sure your laughing ha's made me crie. Now Carmila, you must imagine that 'tis I, and only I, say this to you, and none but you: For the unhappy wag ha's so fitted my Fancie, as if 'twere made for no bodie but me. Excellent Mistris, brighter than the Moon, Than scowred pewter, or the silver spoon: Fairer than PhÅbus, or the morning Star, Dainty fine Mistris, by my troth you are. Thine eyes like Diamonds shine most clearly, As I'm an honest man, I love thee dearly. What think you now, Carmila, is not this Admirable? if these strong lines will Not draw your love, I know not what will. Car. Had it been your own mother-wit, Doron, I could have like't it well: But for you to father the brat of Another's brain, is too ridiculous. I like your love much better than your Hackney lines: but bought wit's best. Dor. If you like not my lines, because they are None of mine, you will not love my Heart neither, for that's not mine, but yours. Car. Yes, Doron, if you have given me your Heart, I will not die in your debt, but Give you mine in exchange for yours. Dor. Than welcome to me my new found heart, We'l live, and love, and never part. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 7. Enter Melecertus. Revenge shall soon o're-take this proud boy, who Committed hath so bold a rape upon My Samela: He had been better to Have lodged snakes in his breast, than to steal This spark, that shall consume him and his nest. Samela! Samela! that name alone Infuseth spirits into me, inflames My soul with vengeance, till I recover My dearest love. Enter Menaphon. Men. Now shall I be reveng'd on Samela, And on her Melecertus both at once: I'll make her know neglected love may turn To hate, and vengeance take the place of scorn. Well met friend Melecertus, what, alone? Mel. I'm solitarie since my mate is gone. Men. Your mate has taken flight, she's on the wing, But I can tell thee where she nests, and bring Thee guickly where thou shalt retrive the game. Mel. If thou wilt do this, Menaphon, I shall Be studious to requite thy love with mine: I pay thee sterling thanks and services. Men. I will not sell my favours to my friends, My work is all the wages I expect. Come, follow me, I'll lead thee to the place, Where the fresh gamesters have thy love in chase. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 8. Enter King Damocles in his Royal robes, Plusidippus and Samela, prisoners. Kin. Now Sir, you see the shepherd is become A King; and though you have deserved death, Yet since you have but acted our commands, We here release you, and not onely so, But entertain you with all due respect, At once belonging to our neighbour-Prince, And near Allie, the King of Thessaly.â Some secret power doth force me love him so, That if I had a daughter to bestow, I'de wish no other Son-in-law, but him. Now my Sephestia, what would I give, Thou wert alive, I had thee, and thou him. Sam. He little thinks I am so near, or that It is his daughter he would make his wife. Kin. Thus, Gentlewoman, you are once more faln Into my hands, I am th'Arcadian King: Be sudden therefore to give me your love, Or else forfeit your life for your contempt; Think on't, and chuse which you'l rather do. Sam. Sir, I am still the same I was before: My love, like to a mighty rock, stands fast, Disdaining the proud billows of your threats. Crowns cannot tempt, nor Kings command my love, My love is free, and cannot be compell'd. True love admits no partners, is content With one, and Cupids statute law forbids Pluralities of loves. Kin. Since y'are so stiff, You will not bow, I'll make you bend, or break. Enter Menaphon with Melecertus. Mel. I am betray'd by this base Menaphon. Kin. Here comes my Rival; when I have dispatch'd Him to the other world, your plea is spoil'd: My sword shall cut your gordian knot in two; Your ghosts may wed, your bodies never shall. I'll be his Executioner my self, I'll trust no other eyes to see it done. Sam. Now is it time t'unmask, and let him know He wounds his daughter through her Lovers sides. She kneels. Father, your furie once expos'd me to The greedie jaws of death, which yet more kind, In pitie sav'd my life, you sought to lose. I'm your Sephestia, Father, know your child. Mel. And is it possible, Sephestia lives, Once more t'enjoy her truest Maximus? Sam. My Maximus, I'm thy Sephestia: Oh that our Plusidippus too were here! Plu. And I am he, my name is Plusidippus. Seph. My dearest son! 'tis he; now were my joys Compleat indeed, were but my Uncle here. Mel. I am so wrapt with joy, I scarce can get Breath, to express my thanks unto the gods. Men. What will become of me? I shall be hang'd, Or lose my place at least; I'll get me home, Amidst their mirth they will not think on me. Exit. Kin. My onely daughter! Dear Sephestia, And you, kind Maximus, I ask Both of you pardon for your injuries, And for requital, thus I do create Thee King of Arcadie; and may the gods Requite your sufferings, and forgive my crimes. Long may ye live, and happy; may your dayes Be sun-shine all, and know no clouds nor night. Enter Lamedon. And that we may not leave one string untun'd, My brother comes to make our consort full; The best of brothers, and the best of friends, Thanks for your care of her, whom you have made Your daughter by a better claim than mine. Now let the whole land swim in mirth, and load The altars with their thankful sacrifice Unto the kinder deities, who through A sea of woes, have sent us happiness. Let's in, and hear the strange and adventures have Befaln your heaven-protected persons; griefs Grow less by telling, joyes are multiplied. Although against them all things seem to strive, At last just men and lovers alwayes thrive. FINIS.</field>
