But after Ioab hym slewe for the death of his brother Asael whom Abner kilde before. But Abner's death Dauid lamented exceedinge much, &amp; wt h Ioab for his death was much offended And Isboseth was after slayne by Rechab &amp; Baana &amp; his head vnto Dauid brought by them that did hym slea. But Dauid did condemne their fact, &amp; for their paynes them killed &amp; after in the citty of Hierusalem remayned And there he from the Iebusits did take the Tower of Sion the wc h the citty of Dauid's cal'd, a goodly habitation.

And Michol: because that she Dauid mockt when as he daunced before the Arke, of children was vntill her death depryued: And six sonnes were to Dauid borne whyle that he dwelt in Hebron where of his eldest of Achinoam begot was Ammon, Cheleab the next, &amp; Absalom his third sonne had to name, fourth Adonias, Saphathia fifth, &amp; the sixt Ietraam. And diuers countries vnto wc h Israel did tribute pay are tributaries now become to Israel at this day. And many Nations conquered are &amp; by Dauid subdued who in subiection Israel had in the tyme that Saul reigned. And Dauid for the loue that he to Ionathas did owe did on his sonne Miphiboseth the lands of Saul bestowe, &amp; well requited all that were his frendes in his aduersity &amp; iust reuenge did take vpon them that had done hym iniury. And Rabba a citty of the Ammonites ys now besiged by Dauid, &amp; Ioab of his Army chiefe captayne ys ordayned. But what th'euent of these same warres will be as yet's not knowne but shortly will yf you'l attentyue bee: So I'l be gone. Kinge Dauid What woman's this that's washinge of her selfe?

I will so do dreede Soueraigne lord, &amp; that wt h out delay Dauid Thankes good vrias for thy paynes. So let's go hence away. Tholas Most gratious prince your enemyes agaynst vs haue prevayled though when we mett them in the field we hotely them pursued euen to the citty gate, for they shott arrows off the wall &amp; many of thy seruants slewe, &amp; others sore dyd gall. &amp; your seruant vrias was one of them that were slayne as Ioab did will mee for to signify to you dreede Soveraigne for in the fore fronte of the battell by Ioab he was placed Dauid Tholas to Ioab thus shall thou say: Here wt h be not discomfited for diuerse ys th'euent of warres: now this &amp; now that man the sworde cutts off.

When Bethsabee heard of her husbands death for hym shee mourned a whyle: but since that tym vnto Kinge Dauid shee ys maryed. &amp; shee hath brought hym forth a sonne: &amp; this Dauids proceedinge ys scandalous to many, &amp; before our lord displeasinge So that yt lykely ys, vnlesse the kinge his synne repent our lord will hym afflict wt h some seuere &amp; grievous punishment. &amp; that to signify to hym Nathan the prophett's cominge here wt h the kinge, &amp; (as yt seemes) they seriously are talkinge &amp; about what yt will appeare, yf you will geue attention accordinge to your vsuall wonte. &amp; so I will be gone. Nathan Dreede Soueraigne lord) there were two men who dwelled in one citty th'one rych, the other pore: The rych man had exceedinge many oxen &amp; sheepe: but the pore man one litle ewe had only wc h he had brought &amp; nourished vp wt h in his house continually amongst his children, and of his owne bread shee did eate euer &amp; of his cupp drynke, &amp; slept in his bosome as his daughter. And when a certayne stranger came to the rych man, he spared his owne oxen, &amp; sheepe, &amp; tooke the pore mans ewe, &amp; killed her for to make a feast for the stranger vnto hym come Dauid Our lord doth lyue, the man's the child of death that hath this done He render shall the ewe foure folde, that hath done this same thing Nathan Thou art the man. Thus sayth our lord: I thee annoynted kinge of Israel, &amp; deliuered thee from Saul thy deadly enemy &amp; the house of thy lord &amp; thy lords wyues I also gaue thee. yea &amp; I gaue to thee the house of Iuda &amp; of Israel &amp; will farre greatter things add to thee, yf these be but litle Why therefore the worde of the lord thy god hast thou contemned &amp; done yll in his sight? Thou hast Vrias t'Hetheit killed &amp; his wyfe taken to thy wyfe, &amp; slayne hym in the sworde of the children of Ammon, for wc h thinge thus sayth our lord for euer shall the sword not from thy house depart, syth mee thou hast dispysd, &amp; the wyfe of vrias taken to thee to be thy wyfe. Behold out of thy house I'l rayse up yll &amp; take thy wyues before thyne eyes, &amp; to thy neighbour will them geue: &amp; he shall sleepe wt h them in ye sight of this sunne for thou hast done yt secretly, but this word shall be done by me in the sight of all Israel, &amp; sight of the sunne. Dauid I synn'd haue to our lord, &amp; wickedly agaynst hym done Nathan. Our lord also thy synne away hath taken: Thou shalt not dye Neuer the lesse the sonne dyinge shall dye, that's borne vnto thee because thou hast made th'enemyes of our lord for to blaspheme where as thou rather should haue bene a good example to them. But now I'l to my house returne haueinge vrgent occasion. Dauid And I no longer here will stay my selfe syth he ys gone Nuncius the sonne that Bethsabee brought forth god hath wt h sicknes visited &amp; for recouery of his health dauid fasted &amp; prayed &amp; lye vpon the ground, &amp; neyther eate nor drunke at all But when he heard the child was dead, for oyntments he did call &amp; washt hym selfe, &amp; eate &amp; drunke, &amp; our lord god adored. Wc h when his seruants saw, there at they greatly were astonyed &amp; vnto one an other sayd: What a strange thinge ys this? that while the infant lyu'd he mourn'd, &amp; not when he dead ys? To whom Dauid did answeare make: I mourned whyle he lyued sayinge: who knows whether he by god to health may be restored? But he beinge dead I do not mourne, nor fast, for I do know he can not come to me agayne, but I must to hym go. And when the child was dead &amp; buryed, he Bethsabee comforted &amp; slept wt h her agayne, &amp; since that tyme shee was deliuered of an other sonne, who Salomon's cald, whom our lord loues intirely. &amp; ten other sonnes of concubins &amp; wyues wc h he did mary Dauid begothen hath since to Hierusalem he did come &amp; Ioab agayne hath fought agaynst Rabba &amp; the citty wonne. And Ammon one of Dauid sonnes begotten of Achinoam wt h Absoloms sister ys in loue, who Thamar hath to name Whom Dauid of Maacha did begot: &amp; what will bee th'issue there of rests doubtfull yet, but tyme will yt discry for here Ammon &amp; Ionadab his nephewe cominge are &amp; to his vncle yt's lyke Ammon will his mynde declare Ionadab Ammon) what makes thee day by day so leane beinge the kings sonne? Ammon. I am in loue wt h Thamar sister to my Brother Absolom Ionadab. Lye on my bedd, &amp; sicknes feyne, &amp; when thy father cometh desyre hym that thy sister may such meate as thy mynd fancieth vnto the bringe: &amp; then thou may thy loue to her discouer Ammon. Your counsel's good; come let's be gone for I longe to speake wt h her Thamar My lord the kinge did tell me that my Brother sicke doth lye on Ionadab my vncles bed, whither wt h this Broth I'l hye to try yf he will tayst there of, as the kinge me commanded Ammon Stay sister stay &amp; lye wt h mee, for that's yt I desyred. Thamar Brother alas what will you do? Intend you for to ravish mee? In Israel that vnlawfull ys, &amp; vnto me great iniury, &amp; shame vnto your selfe, &amp; much dishonour to my father where fore attempt no such foule act, yf you do loue me Brother. But rather speake vnto the kinge, &amp; he will geue me to thee. Ammon. Be quiet for thy labour's lost to stryue &amp; strugle wt h mee. Now minion thou may gett thee hence: for I my lust haue satisfyed &amp; the loue that I bare to thee ys turned Now to hatred Thamar. This euill in expellinge mee exceedeth farre the former Ammon This woman from me Bretzo take, &amp; the dore fast shutt after her Bretzo. I will my lord: come lady go syth yt will be no better Thamar. O wo ys me! what shall I doe? I shamed am for euer. Bretzo. I haue her thrust my lord out at the dores, &amp; shee goes cryinge &amp; sprincklinge ashes on her head, &amp; her longe garments tearinge Ammon Let her do what she list, for my hatred to her is greatter then euer was my loue. Perhaps to Ahsolom her Brother she will go make her mone, &amp; to hym tell what I haue done. &amp; yf shee do yt ys no matter. But now let vs be gone. Nuncius Thamar th'abuse of Ammon hath to Absolom declared who although he did pitty her case, &amp; there at was much grieued yet he wild her to hold her peace, because he was her Brother &amp; there of vnto Ammon did not speake one word or other but did his hatred vnto hym conceale. &amp; Thamar stayed in Absolom her Brothers house in her mynde sore perplexed &amp; when the brute there of to Dauid came, he grieu'd exceedingly But after two yeares Absolom obtayned of his maiesty that all his Brethren might come to a feast at his sheepe shearinge where he his Brother Ammon slew, the rest safly departinge. of whose death when the kinge did heare he was perplexed sore &amp; all his house, &amp; Absolom fledd to the kinge of Gessur, where he three yeares remayned hath. But Ioab when he perceiued that the kings heart for Ammons death from Absolom was turned a woman got for to propose his pardon by a parable vnto the kinge, &amp; what effect yt will haue tyme will tell for here the kinge doth come wt h many nobles in his company wt h the woman that's to make this suite attendinge on his maiesty Lo how she mourninge feynes, haueinge putt on a mourning garment &amp; her face all bedew'd with teares, &amp; garments all to rent &amp; now shee ys about to make vnto the kinge her mone where fore attentyue be what she will say, so I'l be gone. Bruna Saue me o kinge! Dauid. What ys thy suite. Br[una]. Alas I am a widow for my husband ys dead, &amp; thy handmayd had sonnes but two who in the fielde at words fell th'one wt h th'other, &amp; there was none to stay them, but th'one kild the other, &amp; th'other's fled &amp; gone. And behold his whole kinred ryse agaynst thy handmayd, sayinge: Thy sonne that's fled &amp; hath his Brother kild, vnto vs bringe that he may vnto death be putt for killinge of his Brother wc h yf yt happ (my liege) of no sonne I shall be the mother Neither shall my husband haue heire: And this for iustice sake ys not done, but that they an heire of their owne kynne may make King Dauid. Go to thy house, &amp; yf thou speake the truth &amp; do not lye woman I will commandment geue that thy sonne shall not dye. Bruna Dreede Soueraigne your affayres so very many are &amp; great that your highnes may well this your pore handmayds suite forgett &amp; this yll may vpon me light, &amp; on th'house of my father wt h out your fault: where fore my liege make vs yet some securer King Dauid. He that gayne says thee &amp; thy sonne, lett hym be brought vnto mee &amp; I'l such course take that he shall no more presume to touch thee Bruna. The kinsmen many are that would reueng'd be of my sonne so that I can not bringe them all: &amp; yf I bringe but one or two vnto your grace, by the rest he may killed bee the while, wherefore my Liege by publish't oath make hym security Kinge Dauid Our Lord doth lyue, on th'earth there shall no heire fall of thy sonne Bruna. Let not my lord be angry yf I speake agayne. Dau[id]. Speake on Bruna Why then permist thou not Absolom to come agayne, &amp; them that fled away wt h hym, but let's them still remayne in the Idolaters land, where they may be drawne to Idolatry? And as waters do not returne, So on th'earth wee all dye neuer to come agayne to lyfe, so that Ammon beinge dead, can not revived bee: but Absolom may be recalled from Banishment yf that yt please your grace for hym to send: And God will's not a sinners death but would haue hym amend hys former faults, &amp; ready ys then for to shew hym mercy. And god you represent: where fore on Absolom take pitty. And syth your highnes hath by oath both me &amp; my sonne pardoned Let (worthy king) lyke fauour vnto Absolom be shewed Kinge Dauid Tell me good woman ys Ioab of thy counsell in this matter? Bruna He ys my liege: No word of his there was that I did alter Kinge Dauid Behold Ioab my wrathes pacifyed, &amp; I will do thy word go streight &amp; the boy Absolom recall. Ioab Thankes gratious lord. I prostrate fallinge on my face vnto the earth adore thee Now vnto Gessur I'l begone &amp; Absolom fetch home presently Kinge Dauid so do, but bringe hym to his house, &amp; not before my face Ioab. I will: &amp; now I humbly take my leaue of your good grace Kinge Dauid Adewe Ioab, &amp; god speed thee well. Now I'l also be gone Bruna farewell. Bru[na]. All happines attend your royall person. Nuncius. Ioab hath brought Absolom vnto his house, but the kings face he's not admitted yet to see: &amp; for beauty there was neuer in all Israel his peare: &amp; no lesse was his comlynes for from sole of his foote to the crowne of his head he's faultlesse And when he powld his heire (wc h euery yeare once was performed because his bush did burden hym) of common weight yt weyed two hundred sicles, &amp; he in Hierusalem two yeares was &amp; neuer saw of all that tyme the kinge his fathers face. But in the ende to see hym hee by Ioabs meanes was permitted &amp; he the kinge ador'd, &amp; wt h a kisse the kinge hym welcomed. But Absolom hath since that tyme for hym selfe chariots gotten &amp; men before hym for to go: &amp; when any one doth happen for iudgment to the kinge to come, then Absolom doth stand at the entrance of the kings gate, &amp; takes hym by the hand geueinge hym kynd &amp; louinge words, &amp; frendly hym embraceth where by all the kings subiects hearts vnto hym selfe he winneth. But to what ende he doth all this as yet yt ys not knowne but shortly will yf you will patience haue. So I'l begone. Absolom My gratious lord yf yt please you I gladly would be gone to pay my vowes, wc h I did make vnto our lord in Hebron for thy seruant vowinge did vow, &amp; made a faythfull promise when I in Gessur lyuinge was, vnto our lord to sacrifice yf that into Hierusalem I safly came agayne Kinge Dauid Sonne Absolom in peace depart: I will not thee detayne Absolom Then humbly I will take my leaue, wt h thankes vpon my knee Kinge Dauid fare well my sonne: now he ys gone, no longer here I'l tary Nuncius Now Absolom in Hebron ys aryu'd, &amp; hath conspyred agaynst the kinge his father, &amp; many vnto hym are ioyned amongst whom ys Achitophel to Dauid that was counseler where of so soone as the kinge had intelligence by a messenger he to his seruants sayd: The hearts of Israel are wt h Absolom, Aryse let's flee lest sodaynly he should vpon vs come &amp; kill vs, &amp; the citty stryke in the edge of the sworde &amp; wt h hym there did go six hundred souldiers at his worde And the priest Sadoc &amp; the Leuits also wt h hym went caryinge the Arke of god till they had passed Cedrons torrent But then the kinge made Sadoc backe the Arke of god to cary in to Hierusalem, sayinge yf that I shall fynde mercy &amp; grace in the sight of our lord, he'l bringe me backe agayne &amp; shew me yt: The while yt shall wt h in the citty remayne. But yf god shall vnto mee say: I am displeased wt h thee, Let hym do that wc h ys before hym good: I'l take yt patiently. for till that I to god be reconcild, I am not worthy to haue the Arke of couenant for to go in my company. Sadoc then &amp; Abiathar the Arke of god backe caryed &amp; Dauid weepinge &amp; bare foote vp the mount Oliuet clymbed wt h his head couered (as all the rest had that wt h hym went) lest that he had bene seene of them to weepe, mourne, &amp; lament And when yt was told Dauid that Achitophell in company wt h his sonne Absolom was: Infatuat o lord quoth hee the counsell of Achitophel: &amp; then Dauid adored our lord on the topp of the mount: wc h done Chusay repayred to hym wt h his head full of earth, &amp; garments all to rent. whom when Dauid had seene, he to hym thus did say incontinent: Yf thou go wt h me, vnto me a burthen thou shalt bee (for hee no warrier was) But yf thou go backe to the citty &amp; vnto Absolom say: I thy seruant am o kinge as I thy fathers seruant was obedient in ech thinge so I'l thy seruant be, Thou shalt defeate Achitophels counsell for to the priests Abiathar &amp; sadoc thou shalt tell what thou heares out of the kings house, &amp; they shall to me signify by their sonnes what ys sayd. And Chusai went vnto the citty accordinge to the kings desyre: But what he'l do or say as yet's not knowne, but shortly will, so I'l go hence away Moguntio My liege) Siba the seruant of Miphiboseth the sonne of Ionathas, who in tyme past so much for you hath done hath brought vnto your maiesty two Asses that were loaded wt h Rasens, Bread, &amp; figs, &amp; wyne, wc h he to me deliuered Dauid Siba what meane those things? Siba. The asses are to ryde vpon when the kings howshold weary ys haui[n]ge long iourneys gone. The Bread, Rasens, &amp; figs are for thy seruants for to eate when that they in the desert are, &amp; can come by no meate. And the wyne is to be drunke when any man ys faynt or thirsty Dauid Where's thy old maisters sonne? Siba. He in Hierusalem doth tary &amp; sayth: This day the house of Israel agayne restore hym to his fathers kingdome wc h his grandfather had before. Dauid Siba let all things be thyne wc h I to Miphiboseth gaue Siba Thanks my lord kinge for that such grace found in thy sight I haue Alas my Liege who's that that hurleth stones thus at your grace? &amp; at your seruants to? Dauid. It Simei ys come of Saul's race Simei Come forth, come forth thou man of blood, come forth thou man of Belial our lord hath all the blood repayd the of the house of Saul Because thou Sauls kingdome invaded hast, our lord hath taken from thee the kingdome, &amp; to Absolom the same hath geuen, because thou art a man of blood thyne euils have opprest thee Abisai Why curseth this dead dogg my lord? I'l go cutt off his head Dauid Let hym alone that he may curse syth our Lord hath permitted hym Dauid for to curse. And who ys hee that dare say why hath hee so done? Behold my sonne that did come out of mee seeketh my lyfe. By how much more he that's the sonne of Iemini? Let hym alone that he may curse: syth he by god Almighty permitted ys: perhaps our lord may to me mercy shew &amp; respect my affliction, &amp; for this days cursinge doe me good. where fore a whyle yet longer letts walke in his company Semei Come forth, come forth thou man of blood, come forth yt I may kill thee our lord hath repay'd thee all the blood of the house of Saul. What are you gone? no longer here then I will stay at all. Chusai Now Absolom, Achitophel, &amp; all the people are entred into Hierusalem: wherefore I will prepare my selfe, &amp; to hym go. But as it seemes he's this way cominge I will hym meete: God saue thee kinge: our lord saue thee o kinge. Absolom Is this thy kyndnes to thy frende? where fore did thou not go wt h thy frend as before thyne eyes thou sawest others do Chusai Because that I his seruant was, but now serue hym will I that's chosen by our lord &amp; people, &amp; wt h hym will tary &amp; more then that whom shall I serue? ys it not ye kings sonne? Service to thee I'l do, as to thy father I haue done. Absolom Achitophel what shall we do? Achit[ophel]. There are left in ye citty your fathers concubins my liege: Go in &amp; wt h them lye &amp; when Israel hears that you haue your fathers bed defyled they will thinke that you neuer will to hym be reconciled who doubtfull there of yet remayne: But when this deed's once done they will assure them selues no hope's left of reconciliation &amp; then they will cleeue fast to you, &amp; quite forsake your father Absolom. No doubt there of: come let's begone: thou geues good counsell euer Achitophel Dreed soueraigne lord kinge Absolom Ten thousand men I'l take &amp; rysinge this same night will pursute after Dauid make. &amp; now when he's both weake &amp; weary I'l stryke hym in the sword Absolom That pleaseth me. People. And vs. Absol[om]. Chusai wilt thou here to accord? Chusai. The counsell ys not good (my Liege) that's geuen by Achitophel for both thy father &amp; his men as my Liege knows right well are very valiant Souldiers, &amp; of a great &amp; fell courage, And as a sauage beare when her whelps taken are would rage. Yea &amp; thy father ys a man of warre, &amp; of great pollicy &amp; perhaps wt h his Souldiers doth not stay, but lyeth secretly hydd in some caue to saue hym selfe lest he should be assaulted in the night by his foes, or by his owne men be betrayed because he's now growne weake, so yt though he his people kill yet shall not you my gratious lord of Dauid haue your will. And yf there should (as ofte yt haps) some of your men slayne bee yt will the rest discourage my liege &amp; animate your enemy. wherefore my lord by my aduise to gether call all Israel from Bersabe to Dan, who as the sea sand are innumerable &amp; as a potent prince in the midst of them thou shalt bee So shalt thou gayne vnto thy self the glory of the victory wc h other wyse would to Achitophel redound, yf he alone the conquest gott, &amp; thou not there in thyne owne proper person And we thy enemyes will assault where s'euer they are found &amp; we shall couer them as the dew that falleth on the ground &amp; not leaue one wt h hym alyue, but put all to the sword &amp; yf they flye to any citty, the same we'l wt h a corde &amp; ropes inviron round about, &amp; forth wt h pull yt downe into the Torrent, &amp; there of shall not be found a stone. Absolom Chusai thy counsel's better then the counsell of Achitophell People of Israel. We all do thinke no lesse my lord, wherefore take chusais counsell. Absolom Assure your selues I will forth wt h putt yt in execution. where fore to call all Israel to gether let vs begone. Nuncius Chusai vnto Abiathar &amp; Sadoc hath related how all things past, &amp; they the same by messengers haue signifyed already to kinge Dauid, &amp; there wt h this admonition that in the desert he stay not this night, but get hym gone lest he perhaps be swallowed vp, and all his people also &amp; Dauid liks their counsell well, &amp; forth wt h thence will go before that the day light appeare ouer the ryuer Iordan &amp; not one man of all his troupe behinde hym shall remayne And as I heare Achitophel ys waxen very melancholy because his counsell was refus'd, &amp; Absolom lefte presently &amp; to his house wt h in the citty departed all alone &amp; to what ende yt shortly will appeare. So I'l begone. Now haue I order taken wt h my house, &amp; am determined to go &amp; hange my selfe because my counsell was dispysed &amp; here I haue a rope where wt h that feate shal streight be done at the next tree that I can fynde for to be hanged on King Dauid Achitophel I heare hath hang'd hym selfe, &amp; Absolom wt h all the men of Israel now ys ouer Iordan come me to in vade, &amp; therefore I my forces haue deuided into three parts, where of one third to Ioab ys allotted an other to Abisai, &amp; the third part vnto Ethai. &amp; you three shall my captaynes be &amp; fight for me this day And I also wt h you will go in myne owne proper person. Ioab. Not so my liege: Though we should flee the matter's smale or none: or yf the halfe of vs do fall, they are not much the better But syth thou as Ten thousand art accompted, yt ys fitter that in the citty thou remayne yf neede be vs to ayde King Dauid Syth that this seemeth good to you, I'l do as you haue sayd. yet ere you go, Ioab, Ibisai, &amp; Ethai hither come &amp; listen to my words: See that you saue mee the child Absolom in any wyse, So fare you well, &amp; our lord your guide bee Ioab, Abisai, Ethai In hope there of we'l forward go. Dau[id]. &amp; I'l vnto the citty Ioab. We in the forest of Ephraim haue now wt h our foes incountred &amp; twenty thousand of them slayne, &amp; many mo are drowned wt h in the ditches of the forest, then dyed by dynt of sword Malco Nuncius I from the forest came my lord to bringe your honour word that Absolom sittinge vpon a mule, &amp; by chaunce meetinge the seruants of the kinge, his mule vnder a thicke oke runninge the head of Absolom stuck in the tree beinge fast intangled by the heyre, &amp; I lefte hym hanginge there as yet not strangled Ioab. If thou saw'st hym, why didst thou not vnto the earth hym nayle? &amp; I ten siluer sicles &amp; a belt had wt h out fayle on the bestow'd. Malco. yf thou a thousand syluer peeces should pay in my hand, to the kings Sonne no such thinge do I would for vnto thee, Abisai, &amp; Ethai the kinge commandment gaue in all our hearings: See you do me the child Absolom saue. Ioab. Though thou would not, yet I my selfe will kill hym in thy presence where fore come let's no longer stay but forth wt h be gone hence. Achimas When vnto Absolom Ioab came he wt h three lances stroke hym to the heart, &amp; while he gaspinge hange vpon the oke Ten squiers of Ioabs vnto hym ranne &amp; killed hym out right wt h vnto the spectators was a lamentable sight And when that Absolom was dead, Ioab streight the trumpet sounded &amp; caus'd the lyues of all the rest that fled for to be spared And in a pitt wt h in the forest they Absoloms corps haue hurled &amp; there vpon a wonderfull great heape of stones haue heaped But now I'l runne vnto the kinge &amp; tell hym god hath done hym iudgement on his enemyes, &amp; also vpon his sonne Ioab Stay Achimas thou shalt not go that message for to cary this day syth the kings sonne ys dead, wc h will but greeue his maiesty but some other tyme, when there ys better newes thou shalt yt bringe. Chusai. Chusai. what's my lords will? Ioab. Go &amp; relate vnto the kinge what thou hast seene. Chusai. I will my lord. Achim[as]. I will runne after chusai Ioab. why wilt thou runne my sonne? Good newes to hym thou shalt not cary Achimas But yet what yf I runne? Ioab. Runne yf yu wilt. Now I alone am lefte, wherefore backe to myne army I'l also begone. Achimas I haue chusai out runne by goinge of a nearer way &amp; to the kinge first newes I'l bringe of all that's done this day Brunus I haue my liege espyed a man who thys way alone runneth Kinge Dauid If he do come alone, he in his mouth good tydings bringeth Brunus An other man runninge alone vnto me doth appeare Dauid And this same a good messenger ys: Lucky newes we shall heare Brunus The first man runnes lyke Achimas who ys Sadoc his sonne. Dauid He's a good man, &amp; brings good newes. Achimas tell me what's done. Achimas Our lord blesse thee o kinge, &amp; our lord thy god blessed bee who hath the men shutt vp that lifted vp their hands agaynst thee Dauid Is the child Absolom saffe? Achim[as]. A great tumult my liege I sawe when as thy seruant Ioab me sent: No other thinge else I know. Dauid passe &amp; stand there. Chusai. Good tydings to my gratious lord I bringe for our lord hath iudg'd all this day that ryse agaynst the kinge. Dauid Is the child Absolom saffe. Chusai. Let th'enemyes of the kinge so bee as the child, &amp; all that do ryse to yll agaynst his maiesty Dauid I sory am, &amp; can not choose but weepe for my sonne Absolom. O my sonne Absolom, O Absolom myne owne deare sonne! Who would graunt mee that I might for thee dye O Absolom o my sonne Absolom, O Absolom myne owne deare sonne Ioab. Alas my Liege why do you weepe &amp; mourne so for your sonne, where as the victory that's gott deserueth exultation? Dauid O my sonne Absolom, O Absolom myne owne deare sonne! who would graunt me that I might for thee dye sonne Absolom? Ioab The countenance of all thy people my liege thou hast confounded who haue thy lyfe, &amp; the lyues of thy sonnes &amp; daughters saued &amp; of thy wyues &amp; concubins. Thou loues them that hate thee &amp; hates them that thee loue, &amp; thou cares not for thy Nobility nor for thy seruants: But yf Absolom had lyu'de I see &amp; we thy seruants had beene slayne, right well yt would haue pleas'd thee where fore ryse vp o kinge &amp; speake some comfortable worde vnto thy men, or else I sweare vnto thee by our lord one verely will not stay wt h thee this night, &amp; that shall bee worse for thee then all th'euils that from thy youth haue hapt to thee Dauid I will begone &amp; comfort them in the best wyse I can Ioab. And by that meanes thou shall procure the loue of euery man. Nuncius The king's sett in a publyke place, where all to hym resort &amp; he wt h frendly word, &amp; chearefull lookes doth them much comfort And Sadoc &amp; Abiathar commanded hath to say vnto th'Auncients of Iuda, why make you the longest stay in comminge to bringe backe the kinge vnto this house, syth yee my Brethren are, &amp; of my bone &amp; flesh? Say lyke wyse from mee to Amasa: Art thou not of my flesh, &amp; of my bone? vnto me lett these &amp; these things by our lord god be done yf vnder Ioab thou be not euer chiefe captayne of the warre. And he hath wonne the hearts of all that in Iuda are: who hym invited to returne, &amp; mett hym by the way as Simei hath also done, who curst hym the last day, &amp; hath brought wt h hym to the kinge a thousand men of Beniamin. And Siba seruant to Miphiboseth hath also wt h hym byn wt h all his seruants, &amp; hys sonnes: &amp; so Miphiboseth was &amp; euery one through all the tribes of Israel, who found grace in the kings sight: And such as had his maiesty offended were pardoned: And such as had Loyall bene, highly rewarded. And wt h a ioynt consent all Israel hath brought backe the kinge vnto Hierusalem wt h ioyfull hearts, &amp; great reioyceinge. But since one Seba Bochris sonne agayne maketh rebellion &amp; shortly you shall see th'euent there of. So I'l begone. Dauid I Amasa to call to gether the men of Iuda charged agaynst the third day, but he stays beyond the tyme appoynted wherefore I stand in feare lest Seba should afflict vs more then Absolom wt h all his power afflicted vs before. Wherefore the seruants of thy lord (Abisai go &amp; take &amp; hym pursew lest that perhaps he an escape should make by the meanes of some fenced citty Abisai. I will wt h out delay. Dauid So do, &amp; untill thou returne I'l in Hierusalem stay Ioab. Amasa well mett: God saue thee Brother: so now thou art dispatched vnto Abela let's begone, for there ys Seba harboured People Lo here yt ys in sight, let's the walls pull downe of the citty CÃ¦la. Heare yee, heare yee, my lord Ioab come hither, &amp; will speake wt h thee what art thou Ioab. Ioab. I am. CÃ¦la. vnto thy handmayds words geue eare Ioab. I do. CÃ¦la. Am not I shee in Israel that the truth doth answeare? &amp; thou seekes to subuert &amp; ouerthrow a mother citty. why shall th'Inheritance of our lord head longe be cast downe by thee? Ioab. Nay god forbid, nay god forbid good woman I should do so for my intention's neyther to destroy, nor ouer throw: But a man of mount Ephraim Seba Bochri's sonne by name hath lifted vp his hand agaynst the kinge: for hym I came. only deliuer hym &amp; we will depart then from this citty Cela Streight way my lord his head shall off the wall be throwne vnto thee Ioab Do as thou saist, &amp; no hurt to the citty shall be done Cela Behold my lord there ys the head of Seba Bocri's sonne. Ioab I satisfyed am: The trumpet sound, So lets be gone towards Hierusalem vnto our lord Dauid the kinge Nuncius Imagin now that many years since Sebas death are passed &amp; Israel hath three yeares there of wt h famine bene oppressed for the synne that agaynst the Gabaonits by Saul was done for wc h seuen of Sauls race were slayne (Miphiboseth the sonne of Ionathas beinge sau'd for the oath that Dauid had made vnto his father, at whose hands, kyndnes receiu'd he had. And Sauls &amp; Ionathas bones he into Beniamin did cary &amp; in the sepulcher of Cis his father did them bury &amp; also wt h them layd the bones of the seuen of Sauls race wc h for the synne of Saul were slayne: And then agayne god was propitious to the land: And since that tyme Dauid hath gotten of the Philisthijms foure seuerall battels wc h he wt h them hath foughten And when the kinge from all his corporall enemyes was deliuered &amp; had his synnes for geuen. Agayne by Satan he was tempted to go &amp; number all his people: wc h charge to Ioab he hath committed, &amp; at his returne you shall heare what he sayth. And as yt seemes he cominge ys alone here wt h the kinge about for to relate to hym the news that he doth bringe. Ioab. Eight hundred thousand stronge men I in Israel found o kinge that could draw sword. And in Iuda five hundred thousand fightinge. Dauid In numbringe of the people I haue sin'd o lord exceedingly th'iniquity of thy seruant lord transfer for I did foolishly Gad. Choyce of three things to thee ys geuen o kinge by god Almighty choose wc h thou wilt there of (sayth hee) that I may do yt to thee: Eyther thou shalt haue in thy land famyne seuen yeares: Or flee three monthes before thy Aduersaries face &amp; they pursew thee or three days pestilence haue in thy land: choose of these three wc h thou best lykes, &amp; say what I shall answeare hym that sent mee Dauid. Exceedingly I am distrest: But yt ys better for mee into our lord's hand for to fall (for his mercies be many) then fall in to the hands of men. where fore I make election of three days pestilence amongst my people. So let's be gone. Nuncius Our lord the pestilence hath sent to Israle, wc h continued. from morninge till the tyme that by the prophet was assigned And seuenty thousand men there were that of the pestilence dyed And when that th'Angell of our lord god had his hand forth stretched. ouer Hierusalem yt to destroy, our lord had pitty on their affliction &amp; sayd to th'Angel that stroke the citty. Yt's now sufficient, hold thy hand: Wc h when Dauid perceiued he sayd: I wickedly haue done: I am hee that haue synned: These are the sheepe: what haue they done? Let thy hand I beseech thee o lord agaynst mee &amp; my fathers house conuerted bee. And Gad that day to Dauid came &amp; thus to hym did say: Go vp, &amp; build an Altar to our lord wt h out delay in the flore of Areuna: And Dauid went vp accordingly &amp; did the flore of hym for fifty syluer sicles buy: And there an Altar build vnto our lord, where on he offered Holocausts, where wt h our lord was pleas'd, &amp; the plague forth wt h ceased. And Dauid now grows old, and Adonias Haggiths sonne a man most beautifull &amp; fayre, the next borne after Absolom doth take vpon hym to be kinge before his fathers death And on his syde Abiathar ys, &amp; wt h hym Ioab partaketh. But Sadoc, Nathan, &amp; Banaias stand for his Brother Salomon as shortly shall apparent bee, &amp; so I will be gone. Nathan. Haue you not Lady Bethsabee heard tell that Adonias intendeth to be kinge, where as his fathers promise was to you that Salomon your sonne should sitt vpon his Throne &amp; be kinge after hym. Vnto the kinge therefore be gone (who yet ys ignorant here of &amp; let hym vnderstand thus much, &amp; while you talkinge are I'l ready be at hand your wordes for to confirme. Beth[sabee]. Nathan I'l follow your direction wt h many thanks: &amp; now vnto the kinge let vs be gone. God saue my lord the kinge. Dau[id]. Thanks Bethasabee, what's thy will wt h me? Bethsabee. My lord vnto thy handmayd sware by our lord god that after thee Salomon thy &amp; my sonne should reigne &amp; sitt vpon thy throne. And now behold Adonias reignes, wc h to my lord's not knowne. Th'eyes of all Israel on thee looke, desyreinge very earnestly that thou would shew who shall sitt in thy throne, &amp; be kinge after thee Else I &amp; my sonne Salomon shall very basely be esteemed when my lord wt h his fathers sleepes, vnlesse this be determined. Nathan. My lord kinge didst thou say? Let Adonias be kinge after mee, &amp; lett hym sitt vpon my throne? That captayns of the Army &amp; the kings sonnes he called hath, &amp; Abiathar, where as he neyther cal'd Salomon thy sonne, mee, Sadoc, nor Banaias. to feast wt h hym. And now they are wt h hym eatinge &amp; drynkinge &amp; in his hearinge often say; God saue Adonias kinge. Proceeded this from thee o kinge, &amp; hast thou not this worde to me thy seruant told, who vpon the Throne of my lord shall sitt &amp; be kinge after hym, &amp; his kingdome possesse? Dauid Our lord lyueth who hath my soule deliuer'd from all distresse as (Bethsabee) by our lord god of Israel I sware to thee that Salomon thy sonne shall reigne &amp; sitt on my throne after mee. So will I do this day. Beths[abee]. Thanks worthy kinge, god saue you euer Dauid Go &amp; call the priest Sadoc, &amp; Banaias to mee hither. The seruants of our lord go &amp; take wt h you &amp; sett Salomon my sonne vpon my mule, &amp; bringe hym forth wt h vnto Gihon &amp; there let Sadoc &amp; Nathan anoynt hym kinge, wc h done you shall your Trumpetts sound, &amp; cry aloud: God saue kinge Salomon And you shall after hym go vp, &amp; on my throne he shall sitt, &amp; reigne for mee, &amp; the Prince of Iuda be &amp; Israel Banaias Amen, &amp; as our lord hath bene wt h thee, be hee wt h Salomon &amp; higher make his Throne then euer was Kinge Dauids Throne. Sadoc. As you my gratious lord commanded haue all shall be done Dauid I make no doubt there of at all, wherefore let's hence be gone. Nuncius. Sadoc the priest a horne of Oyle did take out of the Tabernacle &amp; there wt h hath annoynted Salomon kinge ouer Israel wt h great applause of all the people, who sayd: God saue king Salomon as you your selues shall shortly heare: &amp; so I will be gone.
