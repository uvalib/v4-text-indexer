      <field name="fulltext">âImmensum spatiis confecimus Ã¦quor, Et jam tempus equÃ»m fumantia solvere colla. Virg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST HONOURABLE The MARQUESS OF CARNARVAN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Darius, King of Persia. Apame, his Queen. Zerobabel, an Israelite, of the Guard. Belemus, Persian, of the Guard. Semellius, Persian, of the Guard. Chorus of Israelites. Chorus of Persians.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART I. RECITATIVE. Belemus. Lords of the household, hail! Ye Princes, rang'd Around the Persian throne; ye Rulers o'er Thrice sixty and sev'n provinces, that reach From Ganges to the Nile, and bow the knee To great Darius, hail! The Festival, Devoted to his Consort's birth, awaits ye. Zorob. Auspicious be it to our exil'd race, Restoring what we lost when Cyrus dy'd; For, ere he dy'd, he bade our Temple rise On columns, stable as our Fathers faith, Our tribes assembled, and return'd our spoils. AIR. Royal bounty, to our cost Seldom found, and quickly lost! Time had almost reconcil'd us To a haughty Master's chain: Why has empty hope beguil'd us, Only to redouble pain? RECITATIVE. Semell. Forbear to trample with unhallow'd feet On Royal dust: 'tis double sacrilege. AIR. Arsaces Artaxerxes., taught by sure Records, That Sion was destroy'd before For levying war on sov'reign Lords, Ordain'd her tow'rs to rise no more. CHORUS of Persians. The stern decree was kindly meant: He would not punish, but prevent. RECITATIVE. Zorob. Peace to his shade! and honourable fame Enbalm him; but the best of Kings may err, Inflam'd by art with jealousies and fears. AIR. Treating Vassals once offending Worse than Rebels past amending, Leads to ruin and despair: Cyrus grieving, And relieving, Saw our woe, and heard our pray'r. CHORUS of Israelites. Limbs alone let Tyrants bind; Heav'n and Cyrus bound the Mind. RECITATIVE. Bel. Be hush'd, ye Slaves; the King and Queen approach. Darius. Let All be present, while we judge the cause Of Wine, of Kings, of Women, and of Truth; The four pretenders to unrival'd strength. Let Him, who laid that Writing underneath My pillow, which exalts the pow'r of Wine, Arise, to plead its merit. Let it flow Profusely, as becomes the blest occasion; And aid its Votaries to sing its praise. AIR. Bel. A truce with bus'ness then, and Thinking; The bus'ness of to-day is Drinking: Darius gives to wine and mirth The day that gave Apame birth. CHORUS. Blessings on the matchless Pair! Fill the goblet to the brim, For the King, and for the Fair: Drink till we are Kings like Him. RECITATIVE. Bel. The Vine's enchanting juice unlocks the wise, Emboldens Cowards, smooths the rugged brow, Opens the Miser's hand, and mends the heart: It wings the fancy: To the poor 'tis wealth, And freedom to the slave; the fool and traytor Are rais'd to sense and loyalty by Wine. AIR. Nature's failings Wine supplies, Fortune's malice Wine defies; Never daunted at her frowns, Sunk by chains, or aw'd by crowns. RECITATIVE. Bel. The human mind, oppress'd by native weight, Flies from itself to action, or is bury'd In gloomy sloth and philosophic dreams; And happiness in most is rest from pain. AIR. In vain the Sage his rules applies, For only he who drinks is wise: Wisely time for Wine we borrow, Healing or adjourning sorrow. Let not day confine delight; Let us revel half the night, And to Fate commit the morrow. RECITATIVE. Semellius. The next in order, by command, I rise, The loyal advocate of regal power: The mute Creation, whether earth, or air, Or water they inhabit, serve Mankind; And land and sea are ours; but what are We, Compar'd with Him whom heav'n has fix'd above us, And stamp'd its image on him, King Darius? CHORUS. Lord of universal sway, Second only to Divine, Myriads thy commands obey: All is Man's, and Man is thine. RECITATIVE. Semellius. Beware contending with the King: Obedience To sov'reign pow'r preserves the moral world From sure destruction, like th' eternal chain, That links Creation to the throne above. AIR. Speak, Darius! and we run, Or to kill, or to be kill'd: Nod! and be thy pleasure done; Look! and be thy wish fulfill'd. CHORUS. In the Monarch's quarrel bold, Soldiers, for a scanty hire, Parch'd by heat, or chill'd by cold, Dart the jav'lin, lanch the fire, To immortalize his name: Theirs the toil, His the spoil; Theirs the danger, his the fame. RECITATIVE. Semell. Behold, he frowns! the nations stand aghast! He draws the sword of justice and revenge, To right his people, and assert his crown: From distant shores, and Asia's better half, Embattled squadrons to his standard croud, And walls, and tow'rs, and mountains overturn. AIR. And now the foe advances A wood of glitt'ring lances: The drums to combat beat; Our hearts th' alarm repeat: The trumpet's shrill sound In shouting is drown'd. To arms! the charging soldiers cry: To arms! the foe, the hills, the rocks, reply. CHORUS. Hark! the thunder of the battle; Bucklers clatter, chariots rattle: The King our valour rouzes, And Heav'n our cause espouses; And heaps of heroes slain Oppose our way in vain. RECITATIVE. Semell. Yet, sure, our God the Sun would vainly roll His flaming chariot o'er the plenteous east, To ripen incense, on his altars laid, And gold, to deck his shrines; and fair abundance To feed his worshippers, and heap their stores For tribute to the King; were Heav'n to blast Our fruitful plains with war and desolation. Let Princes then be deaf to wild ambition; And War their last resource, but Peace their choice. AIR. Fields in vital fruits abounding, Shady vales with herds resounding, Flow'ry bloom and fair increase; Soft repose, content, and pleasure, Social love and flowing treasure, Are the genuine boast of Peace. AIR. And ever be our Monarch's praise With Olive-wreaths to twine the Bays; Let mercy still support his throne, And make the willing world his own; Led by example as by law, And govern'd more by love than awe. CHORUS. So shall he shine above the rest, The greatest King, because the best; And more than All, by blessing All, be bless'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. RECITATIVE. Zorobabel. Mine is the double province, to defend The strength of Woman first, and then of Truth; For neither Wine, nor yet the great Darius, Surrounded by his Multitudes, excells; But Woman, in a sphere above them both. Apame, fairest of thy kind, inspire me To vindicate a cause so much thy own, And vouch the King himself, who kneels before thee. AIR. Soft as air by Zephyrs borne; Sweet as odours of the morn; Beauty's pattern, Virtue's dwelling, All thy sex in charms excelling! RECITATITE. Darius. With pride I wear my dear Apame's chain; Look on her face, and read my reason there: The charms of mutual love have bound me to her, Her Virtue's Convert, and her Beauty's Slave. AIR. The Rose that opens to the Sun, The Sun that mounts the morning skies, Completely here are match'd in one, By bright Apame's cheeks and eyes: And thence if the descending sight Alternate o'er her bosom stray, She chears us with a milder light, That overflows the milky way. RECITATIVE. Apame. The Virgin quickly won can ne'er depend On constancy untry'd; but had I treated My gracious Lord with rigour or caprice, Proud of my pow'r, and pleas'd to see him languishâ Darius. My persevering love, repaid with scorn, Ev'n then had witness'd thy superior charms. AIR. The worst that Love can feel or fear, What is it, balanc'd with the blessing? To make the pain a pleasure here, Add but the thought of once possessing. CHORUS. Pain the vulgar mind annoys; Courage scorns it, Love enjoys; Love can all extremes sustain; Life the venture, heav'n the gain. [Apame, taking the Crown off the King's head, places it on her own. RECITATIVE. Darius. How kindly my Apame's hands have eas'd My anxious head of empire's galling badge, To place it on her own! it suits her well, And borrows lustre from her brighter eyes: But sits it not too heavy? Apame. Be not jealous, My Royal Master: I have worn too long What I shall now restore. [Offering the Crown. Darius. What means my Love? [Refusing it. Restore it no! or first restore your grace; The toy without it is not worth my care, And still sits heavy when Apame frowns. [Apame replaces the Crown on the King's head. Zorob. She smiles! and Persia has her Lord again! Ye Pow'rs! the joy that kindles in his cheeks, Pants at his heart, and dances in his eyes, That fix upon her their insatiate beams. AIR. Darius. Thus my eyes my heart obeying, Never from Apame straying, How can years her face invade? I, who see it not decaying, Shall not fancy it decay'd. AIR. Zorob. These are raptures not uncommon To the morning-stage of life; But, to crown the strength of Woman, Let the Friend complete the Wife. RECITATIVE. Darius. Such is the strength of Her, and Her alone, Who true, and gentle, and discreet, maintains Her empire, unimpair'd by time and favours; And not by one extreme atones another, Too harsh a Mistress, and too fond a Bride. AIR. Apame to her dying hour Is sure to be admir'd; For reason shall confirm the pow'r, Which passion first inspir'd. AIR. Apame. Be my endeavour to excell, As you, my Royal Love, foretell; And teach the World its Sov'reign's will, By my example, to fulfill. AIR. Zorob. Or lead him by a silken band, And learn by yielding to command. AIR. Apam. The load of your imperial care I fain would ease, but never share; To secrets and to failings blind, And to my native sphere confin'd. CHORUS. So shall the Fates to your extended sway Add glory and content, while beauty steals away. RECITATIVE. Zorob. The King and Princes, looking at each other In silent approbation, seem inclin'd To vote the conquest Woman's. Great Darius, Permit me to perform the better part Of what I undertook. Darius. Thy writing mentions The Strength of Truth: Proceed, Zorobabel, And say, what is it? Zorob. Woman sure is strong; But Truth is stronger. The Divine Ideas, Eternal as the Mind in which they dwell, Are Truth; the standard, counter-part, and source, Of all created things! Is He not great Who rounded earth? extended heav'n's expanse? And wing'd the sun's career from east to west? Unequall'd therefore is the strength of Truth. CHORUS. The Truth, by native light confess'd, And sought below, above is bless'd. Ye wicked, tremble at her name, For true and righteous are the same. RECITATIVE. Zorob. Let Truth unmask her rivals: She is righteous, And They too oft are wicked. Wine's excess Is wicked in itself; and worse by far, Big as it is with dire events, which speak Its strength, alas! too fatally: For, hark! The trumpet and the lute, the melting voice, And, sweeter yet, the harmony of hearts, Are lost in uproar, from a cause unknown: And scoffs, and threats, and wounds, ensue; and blood, Promiscuous with the wine that drew it, floats The pavement. See! the reveller, who swill'd The midnight cup in jollity, has stain'd His wedding garment with the vital stream, Pierc'd thro' the heart, and breathless on the floor. AIR. His raving Bride her fury vents; Their robes his Parents rend; But most the Murderer laments, For he has slain his Friend! RECITATIVE. Dar. Deplorable effect of gen'rous Wine Perverted to abuse! Nay, pause not, youth; But, bold in Truth's behalf, arraign the King: For how can Kings, whose presence makes the Court, Where She so seldom enters, stand her test? Zorob. Truth may be frank; but should be cautious too, And only whisper, when she mentions Kings; The best are wonders, and the worst are men. Dar. But what am I? We know the royal ermine Too soon is soil'd: Speak freely, and be thank'd. AIR. Let Warriors, who in strength excell, In fighting fields be bold; Thy courage be my faults to tell, And mine to hear them told. RECITATIVE. Zorob. How gladly Truth would triumph in the praise Of Kings and Women, were all Kings like You, All Women like the Queen! But some offend; And, being best, if good; are worst, if bad. Let history record the crimes of Kings Deceas'd: While yet they live, those crimes demand Our awful silence. Publishing the faults Of Monarchs weak or wicked, oft may wound A kingdom deeper than the faults themselves. CHORUS. The Sun, the spring of life and light, Rejoices its adorers sight; But, should he gaze its spots to find, Strikes the presumptuous mortal blind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. RECITATIVE. Apame. What says Zorobabel to wanton Charms, And Beauty's empire o'er the heart, abus'd? Zorob. It turns the heart it gains from virtue, oft Its native bent, to violence and fraud. We ransack earth and sea in quest of gold, And rob and kill, to sooth a Wanton's pride. Distraction, Slavery, Despair, and Death, Wait on her frown. If Love enlightens fools, It oftner blinds the wise. Remember Helen, And Asia heretofore (ye Pow'rs avert The dreadful omen!) by the Greeks o'erturn'd. CHORUS. Let ten years war, the price of lawless joy, And rapid Simois, red with blood, declare The cause that ruin'd heav'n-defended Troy; A heart too tender, and a face too fair. RECITATIVE. Such are thy Rivals, Truth; but Thou art pure: Yet Int'rest hates, and mad Ambition flies thee; Rank, Affluence, Pow'r, Prosperity, and Mirth, Have little leisure to consult with Thee. Corruption, Flattery, and groundless Fears, Drive Thee from Cabinets, and dark Cabals, From factious Senates, and from giddy Crouds: But he who dares to look within himself, With a cool head, and honest heart, shall find thee. AIR. To a rural scene convey me, Where no hopes nor fears betray me: Passion hush'd, and vice subdu'd, Tune the soul to solitude. Contemplation there shall charm her; Quiet lull, and Virtue arm her. AIR. Hail the gloomy close of light! Hail the calm of silent night! Nature's music in the wood! Drowsy murmurs of the flood! Thither, Truth, my way prepare; Let us be companions there. RECITATIVE. How potent, all-subduing Truth, art Thou! Imposture, sanctify'd by age, at length Shall yield to Thee: False glory, false religion, And lying oracles, shall fall before thee. AIR. The worship of the Sun shall end, The Sun himself to night descend, The Heav'ns dissolve, and pass away, And only Thou thy light display, In beams of uncreated day. AIR. To Persons Thou hast no regard; Unbiass'd in thy just award By all the tender ties of life, The Friend, the Father, or the Wife; By Passion, in a thoughtless hour; The bribe of Wealth, and frown of Pow'r. RECITATIVE. Thy magic wand, with one transforming touch, Restores the villain to his genuine shape, Stripp'd of the holy veil that long disguis'd him. 'Tis thine, with sov'reign justice, to reform The stile of custom, flattery, or humour; And brand all evil with its proper name. AIR. Alike by thy commission fall The partial Judge and Criminal; The Robber in his den alone, Or mounted on a guilty throne. RECITATIVE. In vain the grand offender mocks the Law, Pursu'd by Thee, and thy avenger, Conscience, To hold the mirror of his crimes before him, And lash his felon heart with whips of steel. AIR. 'Tis thine, amid the depth of night, To shoot the mind's tremendous light; With ghastly dreams distract the head, And turn to thorns the downy bed. CHORUS. Truth, Thou art great in life and story, And heav'n and earth, and might and glory; Thou art the kingdom, pow'r, strength, majesty, And ages numberless are blest in Thee: Blest be the God of Truth to all eternity! RECITATIVE. Dar. As Thou hast gain'd the glorious cause of Truth, Distinguish'd by superior wisdom, take The promis'd marks of victory and honour: From gold to quaff the grape's delicious juice, And on a couch of gold to sleep, be thine; The golden chariot, and the harness too. Let Egypt's linnen thy tiara grace, And hang a chain of gold about thy neck: Array'd in purple, be Thou seated next me, The kinsman of my throne. If aught beside, Thy wishes yet can name, demand and have it. Zorob. With gratitude beyond what words can utter, I own the bounty I can ne'er deserve; And yet, by your permission, ask for more: Rebuild, my Lord, our city and our temple, And pay your vow to Heav'n's almighty King, Made when he rais'd you to the Persian throne. Dar. My vow is sacred; and I seal it thus. [Kissing him. AIR. Zorob. Heroic Prince! reviving sound! Waft it, ye winds, the world around; But first to Sion, to the place Where Sion stands, I turn my face; For there my ravish'd eyes Shall view a Temple rise, The care and wonder of the skies. RECITATIVE. Darius. The holy vessels shall be yours again; Your tribute is remitted; your possessions, Usurp'd by Edom's sons, shall be restor'd. A fund of twenty talents I allot Each year, to this important work; and ten To furnish out the pomp of sacrifice: A standing force, defray'd at my expence, Shall guard Jerusalem; the plan design'd By Cyrus, great and good, I swear to finish, And raise a Temple to the God of Truth. AIR. Zorob. For This, to great Jehovah's praise, Our hands, our harps, our hearts we raise; The conquest, gracious Lord, is mine, The wisdom that atchiev'd it, thine. CHORUS of Israelites. By Thee to Israel, now a Nation, Descend the tidings of Salvation; Darius shall caress thee, Thy captive Brethren bless thee, By wisdom victorious, By victory glorious; Yet not to Thee, but Heav'n, Be praise, be might, and glory giv'n. The End of the Oratorio.</field>
