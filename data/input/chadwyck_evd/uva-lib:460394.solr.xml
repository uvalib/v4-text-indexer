      <field name="fulltext">THE REVENGE. A BURLETTA;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Acted at Marylebone Gardens, 1770; with additional Songs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ Jupiter â Mr. Reinhold. Bacchus â Mr. Bannister. Cupid â Master Cheney. Juno â Mrs. Thompson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. JUPITER. Recitative. I swear by Styx, this usage is past bearing; My lady Juno ranting, tearing, swearing! Why, what the devil will my godship do, If blows and thunder cannot tame a shrew? Air. Though the loud thunder rumbles, Though storms rend the sky; Yet louder she grumbles, And swells the sharp cry. Her jealousy teasing, Disgusting her form: Her music as pleasing As pigs in a storm. I fly her embraces, To wenches more fair; And leave her wry faces, Cold sighs, and despair. Recitative. And oh! ye tedious minutes, steal away; Come evening, close the folding doors of day; Night, spread thy sable petticoat around, And sow thy poppies on the slumbering ground; Then raving into love, and drunk with charms, I'll lose my Juno's tongue in Maia's arms. Air. Sighing, Dying, Lying, Frying, In the furnace of desire; Creeping, Sleeping, Oh! how slow the hours retire! When the busy heart is beating, When the bosom's all on fire, Oh! how welcome is the meeting! Oh! how slow the hours retire! Recitative. But seeâmy Fury comes; by Styx, I tremble: I'll creep asideâ'tis folly to dissemble. Scene II. Juno, Jupiter. JUNO. Recitative. See, see, my good man steals aside! In spite of his thunder, I make him knock under, And own the superior right of a bride. Air. How happy the life Of a governing wife, How charming, how easy, the swift minutes pass; Let her do what she will, The husband is still, And but for his horns you would think him an ass. How happy the spouse In his dignified brows; How worthy with heroes and monarchs to class: Both above and below, Experience will shew, But take off the horns, and each husband's an ass. JUPITER. Recitative. [Aside Zounds, I'll take heart of grace, and brave her clapper; And, if my courage holds, egad, I'll strap her: Through all Olympus shall the thunders roll, And earth shall echo to the mustard-bowl; Should she prove sturdy, by the Lord, I'll heave hence, Down to some brandy shop, this noisy grievance. Air. What means this horrid rattle? And must that tongue of riot Wage one eternal battle With happiness and quiet? JUNO. Air continued. What means your saucy question? D'ye think I mind your bluster? Your godship's always best in Words, thunder, noise, and fluster. JUPITER. Recitative. Hence, thou eternal tempest, from our regions, And yell in concert with infernal legions: Hence, or be calmâour will is fateâaway hence, Or on the lightning's wings you'll find conveyance. JUNO. Recitative. I brave your vengeanceâ JUPITER. Oh! 'tis most provoking! JUNO. Should not my spirit better my condition, I've one way leftâremonstrance and petition To all the gods in senate: 'tis no jokingâ Air. I will never tamely bear All my wrongs and slights, sir; Heaven and all the gods shall hear How you spend your nights, sir: Drinking, swearing, Roaring, tearing, Wenching, roving everywhere; Whilst poor I At home must lie, Wishing, scheming, Sighing, dreaming, Grasping nothing but the air. JUPITER. Recitative. O how shall I escape the swelling clatterâ I'll slit her tongue, and make short work o'th' matter. Air. Fury, cease, Give me peace, Still your racket, Or your jacket I'll be drubbing, For your snubbing; By the gods, you shall knock under. Must you ever Thus endeavour, Rumbling, Grumbling, Rowling, Growling, To outsound the noisy thunder? JUNO. Recitative. [Aside. Ah! I'm quite out hereâplaguily mistakenâ The man's in earnestâI must save my bacon; Since scolding but provokes him, A method I'll pursue. I'll soothe him, tickle, coax him, Then I shall have my due. Air. Ah, cruel, cruel Jove, And is it thus a love, So pure, so chaste, so strong as mine, Is slighted, disrespected, Unnoticed and neglected, Returned with such a love as thine? JUPITER. Air. Did the foolish passion tease ye, Would you have a husband please ye, Suppliant, pliant, amorous, easy? Never rate him like a fury: By experience I'll assure ye, Kindness, and not rage, must cure ye. JUNO. Recitative. [Aside. He's in the right on'tâhits it to a tittleâ But Juno must display her tongue a little. Air. I own my error, I repent; Let thy sparkling eyes behold me, Let thy lovely arms infold me; Let thy stubborn heart relent. JUPITER. Recitative. Egad, why this is more than I desire, 'Tis from the frying-pan to meet the fire; Zounds, I've no stomach to the marriage-bed; But something must be either sung or said. Air. What is love? the wise despise it; 'Tis a bubble blown for boys: Gods and heroes should not prize it, Jove aspires to greater joys. JUNO. Air continued. What is love? 'tis nature's treasure, 'Tis the storehouse of her joys; 'Tis the highest heaven of pleasure, 'Tis a bliss which never cloys. JUPITER. Air continued. What is love? an air-blown bubble, Only silly fools receive it: 'Tis a magazine of trouble; 'Tis but follyâthus I leave it. [Jupiter runs off. Scene III. JUNO. Recitative. Well, he is gone, and I may curse my fate, That linked my gentle love to such a mate; He neither fills my freezing bed, my heart, nor My vainly-folding arms: oh! such a partner! Air. When a woman's tied down To a spiritless log, Let her fondle or frown, Yet still he's a clog. Let her please her own mind, Abroad let her roam; Abroad she may find What she can't find at home. Scene IV. Juno and Cupid. CUPID. Recitative. Ho! mistress Junoâhere's a storm a-brewingâ Your devil of a spouse is always doingâ Pray step asideâthis evening, I protest, Jove and Miss Maiaâyou may guess the restâ JUNO. How! what? when? where?ânay, pri'thee now, unfold it. CUPID. 'Gadâso I will; for, faith, I cannot hold it. His mighty godship in a fiery flurry Met me just nowâconfusion to his hurry! I stopt his way, forsooth, and, with a thwack, He laid a thunderbolt across my back: Bless me! I feel it nowâmy short ribs ache yetâ I vowed revenge, and now, by Styx, I'll take it. Miss Maia, in her chamber, after nine, Receives the thunderer, in his robes divine. I undermined it all; see, here's the letterâ Could dukes spell worse, whose tutors spelt no better? You know false spelling now is much the fashionâ JUNO. Lend me your dropsâoh! I shall swoon with passion! I'll tear her eyes out! oh! I'll stabâI'll strangle! And worse than lover's English, her I'll mangle! CUPID. Nay, pray be calm; I've hit off an expedient To do you rightâ JUNO. Sweet Cupid, your obedientâ CUPID. Tie Maia by the leg; steal in her stead Into the smuggled raptures of her bed; When the god enters, let him take possession. JUNO. An excellent scheme! My joy's beyond expression! CUPID. Nay, never stay; delaying may confute it. JUNO. O happy thought! I fly to execute it. [Exit Juno. Scene V. Cupid. Recitative. See how she flies, whilst warring passions shake her, Nor thought nor lightning now can overtake her. Air. How often in the marriage state The wise, the sensible, the great, Find misery and woe; Though, should we dive in nature's laws To trace the first primÃ¦val cause, The wretch is self-made so. Air changes. Love's a pleasure, solid, rÃ«al, Nothing fanciful, ideal, 'Tis the bliss of human kind; All the other passions move In subjection under Love, 'Tis the tyrant of the mind. Scene VI. Cupid, Bacchus with a bowl. BACCHUS. Recitative. 'Odsniggers, t'other draught, 'tis devilish heady, Olympus turns about; (staggers) steady, boys, steady! Air. If Jove should pretend that he governs the skies, I swear by this liquor his thundership lies; A slave to his bottle, he governs by wine, And all must confess he's a servant of mine. Air changes. Rosy, sparkling, powerful wine, All the joys of life are thine! Search the drinking world around, Bacchus everywhere sits crowned: Whilst we lift the flowing bowl, Unregarded thunders roll. Air changes. Since man, as says each bearded sage, Is but a piece of clay, Whose mystic moisture lost by age, To dust it falls away; 'Tis orthodox beyond a doubt, That drought will only fret it; To make the brittle stuff hold out, Is thus to drink and wet it. Recitative. Ah! Master Cupid, 'slife, I did not s'ye, 'Tis excellent champagne, and so here's t'ye: I brought it to these gardens as imported, 'Tis monstrous strongâyou need not twice be courted. Come drink, my boyâ CUPID. Hence, monster, hence! I scorn thy flowing bowl, It prostitutes the sense, degenerates the soul. BACCHUS. Gadso, methinks the youngster's woundy moral! He plays with ethics like a bell and coral. Air. 'Tis madness to think To judge ere you drink,â The bottom all wisdom contains: Then let you and I Now drink the bowl dry, We both shall grow wise for our pains. CUPID. Pray keep your distance, beast, and cease your bawling, Or with this dart I'll send you catterwauling. Air. The charms of wine cannot compare With the soft raptures of the fair: Can drunken pleasures ever find A place with love and womankind? Can the full bowl pretend to vie With the soft languish of the eye? Can the mad roar our passions move, Like gentle breathing sighs of love? BACCHUS. Go whine and complain To the girls of the plain, And sigh out your soul ere she come to the mind; My mistress is here, And, faith, I don't fearâ I always am happy, she always is kind. Air changes. A pox o' your lasses! A shot of my glasses Your arrow surpasses; For nothing but asses Will draw in your team; Whilst thus I am drinking, My misery sinking, The cannikin clinking, I'm lost to all thinking, And care is a dream. CUPID. Provoking insolence! BACCHUS. What words it utters! Alas! poor little creature, how it sputters! CUPID. Away, you drunkard wildâ BACCHUS. Away, you silly childâ CUPID. Fly, or else I'll wound thy soul. BACCHUS. Zounds, I'll drown thee in the bowl! CUPID. You rascally broacher, You hogshead of liquorâ BACCHUS. You shadow, you poacher! Aha!âbring me a stick hereâ I'll give you a trimmer, You bladder of airâ CUPID. You soul of a brimmerâ BACCHUS. You tool of the fairâ CUPID. You moveable tun, You tippler, you sotâ BACCHUS. Nay, then the work's done, My arrow is shot. [Bacchus throws the contents of the bowl in Cupid's face, and runs off. Scene VII. Cupid. Recitative. Kind usage thisâit sorely shall befall himâ Here's my best arrow, and, by heaven, I'll maul him. Revenge! revenge! Oh, how I long to wound him; Now all the pangs of slighted love confound him! Air. No more in the bowl His brutalized soul Shall find a retreat from the lass: I'll pay him, And slay him, His love shall be dry as his glass. [Exit. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Bacchus, with his bowl on his head. Air. Alas, alas! how fast I feel my spirits sinking; The joys of life are past, I've lost the power of drinking. 'Egad, I find at last The heavenly charms of tinking, And in the sound I cast The miseries of thinking. Recitative. I'm plaguy illâin devilish bad conditionâ What shall I do?âI'll send for a physician: But then the horrid feesâaye, there's the questionâ 'Tis losing all a man's estate in jesting, Whilst nurses and apothecaries pÃ¡rtakeâ Zounds, this will never do, 'twill make my heartache. Come then, ye fiddlers, play up t'other bout, I've a new nostrum, and I'll sing it out. Air. Scrape, ye fiddlers, tinkle, tinkle, Music makes my twinklers twinkle; Humming, Thrumming, Groaning, Toning, Squeaking, Shrieking, Bawling, Squalling, O the sweet charms of tinkle, tinkle! Recitative. But this is trifling with the hot disease, Nor wine nor brandy now can give me ease. Air. When a jolly toper ails, And his nectar-bottle fails, He's in a most heavenly condition: Unless he can drink, To the grave he must sink, And Death be his only physician. Recitative. Zounds, can't I guess the causeâhumâcould I say a Short prayer or two, with pretty Mistress Maia? Ah! there it is! why, I was woundy stupidâ Faith, this is all the handy-work of Cupid. Since I'm in love then, over ears and head in, 'Tis time to look about for bed and bedding; But first uncovering, in this magic helmet I'll shew the God that love and wine are well met. Air. Fill the bowl, and fill it high, Vast as the extended sky! Since the dire disease is found, Wine's a balm to cure the wound. O the rapturous delights, When with women wine unites! Recitative. O here, my satyrs, fill the mighty cup, Haste, fly, begone! I'm dying for a sup. Air. I'll fly to her arms, And rifle her charms, In kisses and compliments lavish: When heated by wine, If she should not incline, I'll try all my courage, and ravish. Scene II. A dark Room. Juno. Recitative. Now, Master Jupiter, I'll catch you nappingâ 'Gad, you'll be finely hamper'd your own trap in. Would every husband follow your example, And take upon himself his own adorning, No more would wives upon their trammels trample, No more would stand the ancient trade of horning. Air. What wife but, like me, Her husband would see A rakehelly fellow, a ranter, a rover, If, mistaking her charms, He should die in her arms, And lose the cold spouse in the warmth of the lover? Recitative. Impatiently I waitâ Air. Hark, hark! the God approaches, He longs to ease his pain; Oh, how this love encroaches Through every trembling vein. Oh, how my passion's rising, And thumping in my breast! 'Tis something most surprising, I shall be doubly blest. Recitative. He's hereâNow prosper, Love, my undertaking. I'll steal asideâI'm in a piteous quaking. Scene III. Juno and Bacchus. BACCHUS. Recitative. Now, pretty Mistress Maia, I'm your humbleâ But faith, I'd better look before I tumble: For should the little gipsy make resistance, And call in witnesses to her assistance, Then, Bacchus, should your friends or sister fail ye, You'll look confounded queer at the Old Bailey. Air. The man that has no friend at court, Must make the laws confine his sport; But he that has, by dint of flaws, May make his sport confine the laws. Recitative. Zounds! I've a project, and a fine one tooâ What will not passion and invention do? I'll imitate the voice and sound of Jove, The girl's ambition won't withstand his love. But should she squawl, and cry a rape, and scream on't, Presto, I'm gone, and Jove will bear the blame on't. The farce begins, the prologue's wonderous teasing, Pray Cupid, the catastrophe be pleasing! Air. Oh! where is my Maia? O say What shadow conceals the fair maid? Bring hither the lantern of day, And shew me where Maia is laid. Envious vapours, fly away; Come, ye streaming lights, discover, To an ardent, dying lover, Maia and the charms of day. JUNO. Recitative. [Aside. I have you fastâby all my wrongs, I'll fit yeâ Wise as you are, perhaps I may outwit ye. Air. Here thy longing Maia lies, Passion flaming in her eyes; Whilst her heart Is thumping, beating, All in a heat, in Every part: Like the ocean, All commotion, Through her veins the billows roll, And the soft tempest ruffles all her soul. BACCHUS. Recitative. [Aside. Gods! I have struck upon the very minute; I shall be happy, or the devil's in it: It seems some assignation was intended, I'd pump itâbut least said is soonest mended. Air. Happy, happy, happy hour! Cupid now exalts his power; In my breast the passion raging, All my trembling frame engaging, Sets my every sense on fire; Let us, Maia, now retire. JUNO. Recitative. But say, should I resign my virgin charms, Would you be ever constant to my arms? Would not your Juno rob me of your kindness? Must you not truckle to her royal highness? BACCHUS. No! by the dirty waves of Styx I swear it, My love is yoursâmy wife shall never share it. JUNO, aside. 'Tis a sad compliment, but I must bear it. BACCHUS. Air. Then let's away, And never delay, 'Tis folly to stay From rapture and love: I sicken, I die; O come, let us fly, From the blue vaulted sky To the Paphian Grove. JUNO. Then away! I obey Love and nature. BACCHUS. Since 'tis so, Let us go, Dearest creature! Scene IV. Juno, Bacchus, Jupiter. JUPITER. Recitative. I heard a voice within, or else I'm tipsyâ Maia, where are you? Come, you little gipsy. BACCHUS. Maia's with me, sir; who the devil are ye? Sirrah, be gone; I'll trim you if you tarry. JUPITER. Fine lingo this to Jupiter!âwhy truly I'm Jove the thundererâ JUNO. Out, you rascal, you lieâ BACCHUS. 'Tis I am Jupiter, I wield the thunder! Zounds, I'll sneak off before they find the blunder. [Aside. JUPITER. Breaking from above, below, Flow, ye gleams of morning, flow; Rise, ye glories of the day, Rise at once with strengthened ray! [Sudden light; all astonished. BACCHUS. Zounds! what can this mean? JUNO. I am all confusion! JUPITER. Your pardon, Juno, for this rude intrusion. Insatiate monster! I may now be jealous; If I've my mistresses, you have your fellows: I'm now a very husband without doubt, I feel the honours of my forehead sprout. Air. Was it for this, from morning to night, Tempests and hurricanes dwelt on your tongue; Ever complaining of coldness and slight, And the same peal was eternally rung? Was it for this I was stinted of joy, Pleasure and happiness banished my breast, Poisoned with fondness which ever must cloy, Pinned to your sleeve, and denied to be blest? Recitative. I swear by Styx, and that's a horrid oath, I'll have revenge, and that upon you both. JUNO. Nay, hear me, Jove, by all that's serious, too, I swear I took the drunken dog for you. BACCHUS. And with as safe a conscience, I can say, as I now stand here, I thought the chamber Maia's. JUPITER. It cannot beâ Air. I'll not be cheated, Nor be treated Like the plaything of your will. JUNO. I'll not be slighted, I'll be righted, And I'll keep my spirits still. JUPITER. [To Bacchus. You pitiful cullyâ JUNO AND BACCHUS. [To Jupiter. You rakehelly bully, Your blustering, Clattering, Flustering, Spattering, Thundering, Blundering, I defy. JUPITER. Go mind your toping, Never come groping Into my quarters, I desire, sir: Here you come horning, And adorningâ JUNO. You are a liar, sir. BACCHUS. You lie, sir, you lie. Scene V. Juno, Bacchus, Jupiter, Cupid. CUPID. Recitative. Here are the lovers all at clapper-clawing; A very pretty scene for Collett's drawing. Oh, oh, immortals, why this catterwauling? Through all Olympus I have heard your bawling. JUNO. Ah! Cupid, your fine plotting, with a pox, Has set [your victims] all in the wrong box. Unravel quickly, for the Thunderer swears To pull creation down about our ears. CUPID. Air. Attend! attend! attend! God, demi-god, and fiend, Mortals and immortals see, Hither turn your wondering eyes, See the rulers of the skies Conquered all, and slaves to me! JUPITER. Recitative. Pox o' your brawling! haste, unriddle quickly, Or, by the thunder of my power, I'll tickle ye! CUPID. You, Jove, as punctual to your assignation, Came here, with Maia to be very happy; But Juno, out of a fond inclination, Stepped in her room, of all your love to trap ye. Struck by my power, which the slave dared despise, Bacchus was wounded too by Maia's eyes, And hither stealing to appease his love, Thought Juno Maia; she thought Bacchus Jove. Here rests the matter:âare you all contented? JUNO. No, no! not Iâ BACCHUS. [Aside. I'm glad I was prevented. JUPITER. A lucky disappointment, on my life, All love is thrown away upon a wife: How sad! my interruption could not please her. She moves my pityâ CUPID. Soften, Jove, and ease her. JUPITER. Juno, thy hand, the girls no more I'll drive at, I will be ever thineâor wench more private. [Aside. Air. Smooth the furrows of thy brow, Jove is all the lover now: Others he'll no more pursue, But be ever fixed to you. JUNO. Then contented I resign My prerogative of scolding; Quiet when thy love is mine, When my arms with thine are folding. CUPID. Then, jolly Bacchus, why should we stand out? If we have quarrelled, zounds! we'll drink about. Air. Love and wine uniting Rule without control, Are to the sense delighting, And captivate the soul. Love and wine uniting Are everywhere adored; Their pleasures are inviting, All heaven they can afford. BACCHUS. Zounds, I agree, 'tis folly to oppose it: Let's pay our duty here, and then we'll close it. Air. [To the audience. To you, ye brave, ye fair, ye gay, Permit me from myself to sayâ The juicy grape for you shall rise In all the colours of the skies; For you the vine's delicious fruit Shall on the lofty mountains shoot; And every wine to Bacchus dear Shall sparkle in perfection here. CUPID. For you, ye fair, whose heavenly charms Make all my arrows useless arms, For you shall Handel's lofty flight Clash on the listening ear of night, And the soft, melting, sinking lay In gentle accents die away: And not a whisper shall appear Which modesty would blush to hear. JUNO. Ye brave, the pillars of the state, In valour and in conduct great, For you the rushing clang of arms, The yell of battle and alarms Shall from the martial trumpets fly, And echo through the mantling sky. JUPITER. From you, ye glories of mankind, We hope a firm support to find; All that our humble powers can do Shall be displayed to pleasure you: On you we build a wished success, 'Tis yours, like deities, to bless; Your smiles will better every scene, And clothe our barren waste in green. CHORUS. So, when along the eastern skies The glories of the morning rise, The humble flower which slept the night, Expands its beauties to the light, Glows in its glossy new array, And shines amidst the shining day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS IN âTHE REVENGEâ THE HAPPY PAIR. STREPHON. Lucy, since the knot was tied, Which confirmed thee Strephon's bride, All is pleasure, all is joy, Married love can never cloy; Learn, ye rovers, learn from this, Marriage is the road to bliss. LUCY. Whilst thy kindness every hour Gathers pleasure with its power, Love and tenderness in thee Must be happiness to me. Learn, ye rovers, learn from this, Marriage is substantial bliss. BOTH. Godlike Hymen, ever reign, Ruler of the happy train, Lift thy flaming torch above All the flights of wanton love; Peaceful, solid, blest, serene, Triumph in the married scene. STREPHON. Blest with thee, the sultry day Flies on wings of down away. Labouring o'er the yellow plain Open to the sun and rain, All my painful labours fly, When I think my Lucy's nigh. LUCY. O my Strephon, could my heart Happiness to thee impart, Joy should sing away the hour, Love should every pleasure shower: Search my faithful breast, and see, I am blest in loving thee. BOTH. Godlike Hymen, ever reign, Ruler of the happy train, Lift thy flaming torch above All the flights of wanton love; Peaceful, solid, blest, serene, Triumph in the married scene. A BACCHANALIAN. SUNG BY MR. REINHOLD. Bacchus, ever smiling power, Patron of the festive hour! Here thy genuine nectar roll To the wide capacious bowl, While gentility and glee Make these gardens worthy thee. Bacchus, ever mirth and joy, Laughing, wanton, happy boy! Here advance thy clustered crown, Send thy purple blessings down; With the Nine to please conspire, Wreathe the ivy round the lyre. THE INVITATION. TO BE SUNG BY MRS. BARTHELEMON AND MASTER CHENEY. Away to the woodlands, away! The shepherds are forming a ring, To dance to the honour of May, And welcome the pleasures of Spring. The shepherdess labours a grace, And shines in her Sunday's array, And bears in the bloom of her face The charms and the beauties of May. Away to the woodlands, away! The shepherds are forming a ring, &amp;c. Away to the woodlands, away! And join with the amorous train: 'Tis treason to labour to-day, Now Bacchus and Cupid must reign. With garlands of primroses made, And crowned with the sweet blooming spray, Through woodland, and meadow, and shade, We'll dance to the honour of May. Away, &amp;c. A BACCHANALIAN. What is war and all its joys? Useless mischief, empty noise. What are arms and trophies won? Spangles glittering in the sun. Rosy Bacchus, give me wine, Happiness is only thine! What is love without the bowl? 'Tis a languor of the soul: Crowned with ivy, Venus charms; Ivy courts me to her arms. Bacchus, give me love and wine, Happiness is only thine! THE VIRGIN'S CHOICE. Young Strephon is as fair a swain As e'er a shepherd of the plain In all the hundred round; But Ralph has tempting shoulders too, And will as quickly buckle to As any to be found. Young Colin has a comely face, And cudgels with an active grace, In everything complete; But Hobbinol can dance divine, Gods! how his manly beauties shine, When jigging with his feet! Roger is very stout and strong, And Thyrsis sings a heavenly song, Soft Giles is brisk and small. Who shall I choose? who shall I shun? Why must I be confined to one? Why can't I have them all?</field>
