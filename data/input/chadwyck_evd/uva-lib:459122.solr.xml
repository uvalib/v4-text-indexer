      <field name="fulltext">THE GOBLINS A Comedy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. Wit in a Prologue, Poets justly may Stile a new imposition on a Play. When Shakespeare, Beamont, Fletcher rul'd the Stage There scarce were ten good pallats in the age, More curious Cooks then guests; for men would eat Most hartily of any kind of meat, And then what strange variety each Play, A Feast for Epicures, and that each day. But marke how odly it is come about, And how unluckily it now fals out: The pallats are growne, higher number increas't, And there wants that which should make up the Feast; And yet y'are so unconscionable. You'd have Forsooth of late, that which they never gave, Banquets before; and after.â Now pox on him that first good Prologue writ, He left a kind of rent charge upon wit; Which if succeeding Poets faile to pay, They forfeit all their worth, and thats their play: Y' have Ladies humors, and y'are growne to that, You will not like the man lesse that his boots and hat Be right; no play, unlesse the Prologue be, And Epilogue writ to curiositie. Well (Gentiles) 'tis the grievance of the place, And pray consider't, for here's just the case; The richnesse of the ground is gone and spent, Mens braines grow barren, and you raise the Rent.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Francelia. Act I. Scene I. Enter as to a Duell: Samorat, Philatell, Torcular. Samorat, But my Lords, May not this harsh businesse Yet be left undone! Must you hate me because I love your sister; And can you hate at no lesse rate then death? Phil. No, at no lesse: Thou art the blaster of our fortunes, The envious cloud that darknest all our day, While she thus prodigally, and fondly Throwes away her love on thee; She has not wherewithall to pay a debt Unto the Prince.â Sam. Is this all? Tor. Faith, what if in short we doe not thinke You worthy of her?â Sam. I sweare that shall not make a quarrell. I thinke so too; 'Have urg'd it often to my selfe; Against my selfe have sworn't as oft to her, Pray let this satisfie.â Phil. Sure (Torcular) he thinks we come to talke Looke you Sir;â drawes. And brother since his friend has fail'd him, Doe you retire. Tor. Excuse me (Philatell) I have an equall interest in this, And fortune shall decide it.â Phil. It will not need, hee's come.â Enter Orsabrin. Ors. Mercury protect me! what are these? The brothers of the high-way! Phil. A stranger by his habit.â Tor. And by his looks a Gentleman. Sir,âwill you make one! We want a fourth.â Ors. I shall be rob'd with a tricke now! Sam. My Lords excuse me! This is not civill. In what concernes my selfe, None but my selfe must suffer.â Ors. A duell by this light,â Now has his modestie, And t'others forwardnes warm'd me.â goes towards them. Gentlemen, I weare a sword, And commonly in readines, If you want one, speak Sir.â to Samorat I doe not feare much suffering. Sam. Y'are noble Sir, I know not how t'invite you to it; Yet, there is Justice on my side, And since you please to be a witnesse To our actions, 'tis fit you know our Story.â Ors. No Story Sir I beseech you,â The cause is good enough as 'tis, It may be spoil'd i'th telling. Phil. Come we trifle then.â Sam. It is impossible to preserve I see My honor and respect to her. And since you know this too my Lord, It is not handsome in you thus to presse me, But comeâ Torcular beckens to Orsabrin.â Ah! I understand you Sir.â Exeunt. Philatell and Samoratt fight. Phil. In posture still.â Ah, y'are mortall then it seemes.â A slight wound. Sam. Thou hast undone thy selfe rash man, For with this bloud thou hast let out a spirit Will vex thee to thy grave.â Fight agen, Samorat takes away Philatells sword, and takes breath, then gives it him. Sam. I'm coole agen, Here my Lord.â And let this Present bind your friendship.â Phil. Yes thus.â Runs, t'him. Sam. Treacherous, and low.â Enter Orsabrin. Ors. I have dril'd my gentleman, Have made as many holes in him As would sinke a Ship Royall In sight of the Haven:â How now?â Samorat upon his knee. S'foot yonder's another going that way too.â Now have I forgot of which side I'm on, No matter. I'le help the weakest; There's some Justice in that. Phil. The Villaine sure has slaine my brother. If I have any friends above, Guide now my hand unto his heart.â Orsabrin puts it by runs at him. Samo steps in. Sam. Hold noble youth! Destroy me not with kindnesse: Men will say he could have kil'd me, And that injustice should not be For honours sake, leave us together.â Ors. 'Tis not my businesse fightingâ put's up Th'employment's yours Sir: If you need me, I am within your call. Sam. The gods reward thee:â Now Philatell thy worst.â They fight agen, and close, Samor furles his sword. Enter Orsabrin. Ors. Hell and the Furies are broke loose upon us, Shift for your selfe Sir.â Flyes into the woods several wayes pursued by Three in Devils habits Enter Torcular, weak with bleeding. Tor. It will not be,â My body is a Jade: I feele it tire, and languish under me. Those thoughts came to my soule Like Screech-owles to a sick mans window.â Enter Theeves back agen. Thee. Hereâhereâ Tor. Oh! I am fetcht away alive. Exeunt. They bind him, and carry him away. Enter Orsabrin. Ors. Now the good gods preserve my senses right, For they were never in more danger: 'Ith name of doubt, what could this be? Sure 'twas a Conjurer I dealt withall: And while I thought him busie at his praiers, 'Twas at his circle, levying this Regiment. Heere they are agen.â Enter Samoratt. Sam. FriendâStrangerâNoble youthâ Ors. Heereâheereâ Sam. Shift, shift the place, The wood is dangerous, As you love safety, Follow me.â Exeunt. Enter Philatell. Phi. Th'have left the place, And yet I cannot find the body any whereâ May be he did not kill him then, But he recover'd strength, And reacht the Towneâ âIt may be not too.â Oh that this houre could be call'd backe agen. âBut 'tis too late, And time must cure the wound that's given by fate. Exit. Enter Samoratt, Orsabrin. Ors. I'th shape of Lions too sometimes, And Beares?â Sam. Often Sir.â Ors. Pray unriddle.â Sam. The wiser sort doe thinke them Theeves, Which but assume these formes to rob More powerfully.â Or. Why does not then the State Set out some forces and suppresse them? Sam. It often has (Sir) but without successe.â Or. How so?â Sam. During the time those leavies are abroad, Not one of them appeares, There have been That have attempted under ground; But of those, as of the dead There has been no returne.â Or. Strange. Sam. The common people thinke them a race Of honest and familiar Devills, For they do hurt to none, Unlesse resisted; They seldome take away, but with exchange; And to the poore they often give, Returne the hurt, and sicke recover'd Reward, or punish, as they do find cause.â Or. How cause?â Sar. Why Sir, they blind still those they take, And make them tell the stories of their lives, Which known, they do accordingly.â Or. You make me wonder! Sir,â How long is't since they thus have troubled you? Sam. It was immediately upon The great deciding day, fought 'Twixt the two pretending families, The Samorats, and the Orsabrins. Or. Ha! Orsabrin? Sam. But Sir, that storie's sad, and tedious, W'are entring now the Town, A place lessesafe then were the Woods, Since Torcular is slaineâ Or. How Sir?â Sam. Yes.â He was the Brother to the Princes Mistris, The lov'd one too. If wee do prize our selves at any rate, We must embarque, and change the clime, There is no safety here.â Or. Hum.â Sam. The little stay we make, must be In some darke corner of the Towne: From whence, the day hurried to th'other world, Wee'le sally out to order for our journey. That I am forc't to this, it grieves me not; But (gentle youth) that you should for my sake.â Or. Sir loose not a thought on that A storme at Sea threw me on Land, And now a Storme on Land drives me To Sea agen.â Sam. Still noble,â Exeunt. Enter Nassurat, Pellagrin. Na. Why; suppose 'tis to a Wench, You would not goe with me, would you?â Pella. To chuse,âto chuse,â Na. Then there's no remedy.â Flings down his hat. Pella. What doest meane?â (unbuttons himself Na. Why? since I cannot leave you alive, (drawes. I will trie to leave you dead. Pella. I thanke you kindly Sir, very kindly. Now the Sedgly curse upon thee, And the great Fiend, ride through thee Booted and Spur'd with a Sith on his necke: Pox on thee, I'le see thee hang'd first; S'foot, you shall make none of your fine Points of honour, up at my charge: Take your course if you be so hot. Be doing,âbe doing,â Ex. Na. I am got free of him at last: There was no other way; H'as been as troublesome as a woman that Would be lov'd whether a man would or not: And h'as watcht me as if he had been My Creditors Sergeant. If they should have dispatcht In the meane time, there would be fine Opinions of me.âI must cut his throat In earnest, if it should be so.â Ex. Enter Theeves, A horne sounds. Th. A prizeâA prizeâA prizeâ Perid. Some duell (Sir) was faught this morning, this Weakned with losse of blood, we tooke, the rest Escap't.â Tamoren. Hee's fitter for our Surgeon, then for us, Hereafter wee'le examine himâ Agen a shout. Thee. A prizeâA prizeâA prizeâ (They set them down) Ardelan, Piramant. Tam. Bring them, bring them, bring them in, See if they have mortall Sin, Pinch them, as you dance about, Pinch them till the truth come out.â Peri. What art? Ar. Extreamely poore, and miserable. Per. 'Tis well, 'tis well, proceed, No body will take that away from thee, Feare not,âwhat Country?â Ar. âFranceliaâ Per. Thy name?â Ar. Ardelan.â Per. And thine,â Pira. Piramant.â Per. Thy story,âcomeâ Ar. What story!â Per. Thy life, thy life.â (Pinch him) Ar. Hold, hold,â You shall have it;â (he sighs) It was upon the great defeat Given by the Samorats unto the Orsabrins, That the old Prince for safety of the young, Committed him unto the trust of Garradan, And some few servants more, 'Mongst whom I fil'd a place.â Tam. Ha! Garradan! Ar. Yes. Tam. Speake out, and set me nearer; So; void the place, proceed.â Ar. We put to Sea, but had scarce lost the sight Of Land, ere we were made a prey To Pirates, there Garradan Resisting the first Boord, chang'd life with death; With him the servants too,â All but my selfe and Piramant. Under these Pirats ever since Was Orsabrin brought up, And into severall Countries did they carry him. Tam. Knew Orsabrin himselfe?â Ar. Oh! no, his spirit was too great; We durst not tell him any thing, But waited for some accident Might throw us on Francelia, 'Bout which we hover'd often, And we were neere it now, But Heaven decreed it otherwise:â (he sighs) Tam. Why dost thou sigh?â Ar. Why do I sigh? (indeed,) For teares cannot recall him; Last night about the second watch, the Winds broke loose, And vext our Ships so long, That it began to reele and totter, And like a drunken man, Took in so fast his liquor, That it sunke downe i'th place.â Tam. How did you scape?â Ar. I bound my selfe unto a maste, And did advise my Master to do so, For which he struck me only, And said I did consult too much with feare.â Tam. 'Tis a sad story.â (within there) Let them have Wine and Fire,âbut hearke you,â (Whispers) Enter Theeves. With a Poet. The. A Prize,âA prize,âA prize.â Per. Set him downe,â Poet. âSings.â âAnd for the blew,â Give him a Cup of Sacke 'twill mend his hew.â Per. Drunke as I live.â (Pinch him, pinch him. What art?â Poet. I am a Poet, A poore dabler in Rime.â Per. Come confesse, confesse; Poet. I do confesse, I do want money. Per. By the description hee's a Poet indeed. Well proceed.â (Pinch him) Poet. What d'you meane?â Pox on you. Prethee let me alone, Some Candles here,â And fill us t'other Quart, and fill us Rogue, Drawer, the t'other Quart, Some small Beere.â And for the blew, Give him a Cup of Sack 'twill mend his hew.â Tam.

Looke foure fathome and a halfe OOSâ In contemplation of his Mistres: There's a Feast, you and I are out now Pellegrin; 'Tis a pretty tricke, this enjoyning in absence. What a rare invention 'twood be, If a man could find out a way to make it reall. Pel. Dost thinke there's nothing in't as tis? Na. Nothing, nothing. Did'st never heare of a dead Alexander, Rais'd to talke with a man? Love's a learned Conjurer, And with the glasse of Fancie will doe as strange things? You thrust out a hand, Your Mistresse thrusts out another: You shake that hand that shakes you agen: You put out a lip; she puts out hers: Talke to her, she shall answer you; Marrie, when you come to graspe all this, It is but ayer.

A Country wenches here hard by, One Erblins daughter. N. Good: Erblin: the very place. To see how things fall out. Hold, here's money for you. Harke you, you must assist me in a small designe. Fid. Any thing. Sam. What do'st meane? N. Let me alone, I have a plot upon a wench.â Fid. Your Worship is merry. Na. Yes faith, to see her only. Looke you, some of you shall go back to'th' Towne, And leave us your Coats, My friend and I am excellent at a little Instrument, And then wee'l sing catches. P. I understand thee not; Thou hast no more forecast then a Squirrell, And hast lesse wise consideration about thee. Is there a way safer then this! Dost thinke what we have done Will not be spread beyond this place with ev'ry light. Should we now enter any house Thus near the Towne, and stay all day, 'Twould be suspitious: What pretence have we? P. He speaks reason Samorat. Sa. I doe not like it. Should any thing fall out 'twould not looke well, I'de not be found so much out of my selfe, So far from home as this disguise would make me, Almost for certainty of safety. N. Certainty? Why, this will give it us, Pray let me governe once. Sa. Well, you suffered first with me, Now 'tis my turne. P. Prethee name not suffering. N. Come, come, your Coats, Our Beards will suite rarely to them: There's more money, Not a word of any thing as you tenderâ Fid. O Sir. N.

Re. Of Love? What's that? Or. Why 'tis a thing that's had before 'tis knowne: A gentle flame that steales into a heart, And makes it like one object so, that it scarce cares For any other delights, when that is present: And is in paine when 't's gone; thinks of that alone, And quarrels with all other thoughts that would Intrude and so divert it.â Re. If this be Love, sure I have some of it, It is no ill thing, is it Sir? Or. Oh most Divine, The best of all the gods strangely abound in't, And Mortals could not live without it: It is the soule of vertue, and the life of life. Re. Sure I should learne it Sir, if you would teach it. Or. Alas, thou taught'st it me; It came with looking thus.â (They gaze upon one another. Enter Per. Per.

'Tis a rare wench, she 'ith blew stockings: What a complexion she had when she was warmeâ 'Tis a hard question of these Country wenches, Which are simpler, their beauties or themselves. There's as much difference betwixt A Towne-Lady, and one of these, As there is betwixt a wilde Pheasant and a tame. Pell. Right:â There goes such essensing, washing, perfuming, Dawbing, to th'other that they are the least part Of themselves. Indeed there's so much sauce, a man cannot taste the meat. N. Let me kisse thee for that; By this light I hate a woman drest up to her height, Worse then I doe Sugar with Muskadine: It leaves no roome for me to imagine: I could improve her if she were mine: It looks like a Jade with his tayle tyed up with ribbons, Going to a Fayre to be sold. Pell. No, no, thou hatest it out of another reason, Nashorat. Nas. Prethee what's that? Pell. Why th'are so fine, th'are of no use that day. Na. Pellegrin is in good feeling. Sirra, did'st marke the Lasse 'ith green upon yellow, How she bridled in her head, And danc't a stroake in, and a stroake out, Like a young Fillet training to a pace. Pel. And how she kist, As if she had been sealing and delivering her self up To the use of him that came last, Parted with her sweet-hearts lips still As unwillingly, and untowardly, As soft Wax from a dry Seale. N. True; and when she kisses a Gentleman, She makes a Curtsey, as who should say, The favour was on his side. What dull fooles are we to besiege a face Three moneths for that trifle. Sometimes it holds out longer,â And then this is the sweeter flesh too,â Enter Fidlers. Fid.

How now! what's the matter? abuse our Fidlers? 2 Sol. These are no Fidlers, fools obey the Princes officers, Unlesse you desire to goe to prison too. Sa.

Why there's it; Thou thought'st there was no danger in the sinne, Because 'twas common. Above the halfe of that vast multitude Which fils this place, Women sent hither: And they are highliest punisht still, That love the handsomest. Or. A very lying Devill this Certainly.â P. All that had their women with you, Suffer with us. Or. By your friendships favour though, There's no justice in that: Some of them suffered enough In all conscience by 'em there.â P. Oh, this is now your mirth: But when you shall be pinch't Into a gellie, Or made into a crampe all over, These will be sad truths. Or. He talkes odly now, I doe not like it.

No, no; Bersat bethought himselfe at the mouth of the Cave, And found he would be necessary to our Masque too night. We have set him with his feet in a great tub of water, In which he dabbles and beleeves it to be Helicon: There hee's contriving i'th honour of Mercury, Who I have told him comes this night of a message From Jupiter to Pluto, and is feasted here by him. Th. Oh, they have fetcht him off. Enter Poet and Theeves. Po. Carer per so lo carer, Or he that made the fairie Queene. 1 Th.

Behold (grave Lords) the man Whose death question'd the life of these, Found and recovered by the Theeves 'ith Woods; And rescued since by us, to rescue Innocence. Or. Rare Devill, With what dexteritie h'as raised this Shape up; to delude themâ Pr. Ha? Torcular alive? Ph. Torcular? I should as soone beleeve my brother Neere in being too. Tor. You cannot wonder more to finde me here, Then I doe to unde my selfe. Na. Come unbinde, unbinde, this matter's answered. Judg. 2. Hold: they are not free, the Law exacts The same for breach of prison that it did before. Or. There is no scaping out of fortunes hands. Doest heare; hast never a trick for this?â Ta. Doubt me not, I have without, at my command, Those which never fail'd me; And it shall cost many a life yet Sir, ere yours be lostâ Pr. Stramador you have been a stranger here of late. Str. Peruse this paper Sir, you'l find there was good reason for't. Enter Prince Philatell from above. Sramador, Peridor, Reginella meet them below. Pr. How! old Tamorens brother, Captaine Of the Theeves, that has infested thus Our Countrey? Reginella too, the heire of that fear'd Familie! A happy and a strange discovery. Ta. Peridor, and Reginella, the villaine Has betrai'd me. Re. 'Tis Orsabrin, they have kept their words. Or. Reginella? she was a woman then. O let me goe. Jay. You doe forget sure what you are. Or. I doe indeed: oh, to unriddle now! Stra. And to this man you owe it Sir, You find an ingagement to him there; And I must hope you'l make me just to him. Pr. He does deserve it, Seize on himâ Tam. Nay then all truths must out. That I am lost and forfeit to the Law, I doe confesse, Yet since to save this Prince. P. Prince! Or. (Our Mephosto-philus is mad.) Ta. Yet, Prince, this is the Orsabrin. Or. Ha!â Tam. So long agoe, Supposed lost, Your Brother Sir: Fetch in there Ardelan and Piramont. Enter Ardelan and Piramont. N. What mad Planet rules this day Ardelan, and Piramont. Or. The Divel's wanton, And abuses all mankinde to day. Ta. These faces are well knowne to all Francelians, Now let them tell the restâ Pi. My noble Master living! found in Francelia? Ar. The gods have satisfied our tedious hopes. Ph. Some Imposture. Or. A new designe of fortuneâ I dare not trust it. Ta. Why speake you not? Piram. I am so full of joy, it will not out. Know ye Francelians, When Sanborne fatall field was fought, So desperate were the hopes of Orsabrin, That 'twas thought fit to send away this Prince, And give him safety in another clime; That spite of an ill day, an Orsabrin might be Preserv'd alive. Thus you all know, To Garradans chiefe charge he was committed: Who when our Barke by Pyrats was surpris'd, (For so it was) was slaine 'ith first encounter; Since that we have been forc't to wait On Fortunes pleasure. And Sir, that all this time we kept You from the knowledge of your selfe, Your pardon; It was our zeale that err'd, Which did conclude it would be prejudiciall. Ar. My Lords you looke as if you doubted still: If Piramont and I be lost unto your memory, Your hands I hope are notâ Here's our Commission: There's the Diamond Elephant, That which our Princes Sons are ever knowne by: Which we to keep him undiscovered, Tore from his riband in that fatall day When we were made prisoners: And here are those that tooke us, Which can witnesse all circumstance, Both how, and when, time and place; With whom we ever since have liv'd by force: For on no Kingdome, friend unto Francelia, Did Fortune ever land us, since that houre; Nor gave us meanes to let our Country know He liv'dâ T. These very truths, when they could have no ends, (For they beleev'd him lost) I did receive from them before, Which gave me now the boldnes to appeare Here, where I'm lost by Law. Shouts without, Long live Prince Osabrin. Long live Prince Orsabrin. Na. Pellegrin let's second this: Right or wrong 'tis best for us. Pe. Observe, observe. Pr. What shouts are those? Str. Souldiers of Tamorens the first; The second was the peoples, who Much presse to see their long lost Prince. Phi. Sir, 'tis most evident, and all agrees, This was his colour'd haire, His Aire, though alter'd much with time: You weare too strange a face upon this newes; Sir, you have found a brother I, Torcular, the Kingdomes happines; For here the plague of Robberies will end. It is a glorious dayâ Pr. It is indeed, I am amaz'd, not sad; Wonder doe's keep the passage so, Nothing will out. Brother (for so my kinder Stars will have it) I here receive you as the bounty of the gods; A blessing I did not expect, And in returne to them, this day, Francelia ever shall keep holy. Or. Fortune by much abusing me, has Soâdul'd my faith, I cannot Credit any thing. I know not how to owne such happines. P. Let not your doubts lessen your joyes: If you have had disasters heretofore, They were but given to heighten what's to come. Na. Here's as strange a turne as if 'twere the Fift Act in a Play.â Pell. I'm sure 'tis a good turne for us. Or. Sir, why stands that Lady so neglected there, That does deserve to be the busines of mankinde. Oh ye gods: since you'l be kind And bountifull, let it be here. As fearfully, as jealous husbands aske After some secrets which they dare not know; Or as forbidden Lovers meet i'th night, Come I to thee (and 'tis no ill signe this, Since flames when they burne highest tremble most) Oh, should she now deny me! Re. I know not perfectly what all this meanes; But I doe finde some happinesse is neare, And I am pleas'd because I see you areâ Or. She understands me notâ Pr. He seemes t'have passion for her. Ta. Sir, in my darke commands these flames broke out Equally, violent at first sight; And 'twas the hope I had to reconcile my selfe. Or. It is a holy Magicke that will make Of you and I but one.â Re. Any thing that you wou'd aske me, sure I might grant. Or. Harke Gentlemen, she doe's consent, What wants there else? Pe. My hopes grow cold, I have undone my selfe. Pr. Nothing, we all will joyne in this; The long liv'd feu'd between the Families Here dyes, this day the HyminÃ¦all Torches shall burne bright; So bright, that they shall dimme the light Of all that went beforeâ See Sabrina too.â (Enter Sabrina. Ta. Sir, I must have much of pardon, Not for my selfe alone, but for all mineâ Pr. Rise, had'st thou not deserv'd what now thou su'st for, This day should know no clouds. Peridor kneeles to Tamoren. Tam. Taught by the Princes mercy; I forgive too. Sab. Frighted hither Sir. They told me you woo'd not accept the Princes mercy. Sam. Art thou no further yet in thy intelligence? See, thy brothers livesâ Sab. My brother?â Tor. And 'tis the least of wonders has falne out. Or. Yes, such a one as you are, faire, (Reginella looks at Sabrina. And you shall be acquainted. Sam. Oh could your hate my Lords, now, Or your love dye. Phy. Thy merit has prevail'd With me. Tor. And me. Pr. And has almost with me. Samorat thou do'st not doubt thy Mistresse Constancie. Sam. No Sir. Pr. Then I will beg of her, That till the Sun returnes to visit us, She will not give away her selfe for ever. Although my hopes are faint, Yet I would have 'em hopes, And in such jolly houres as now attend us. I would not be a desperate thing, One made up wholly of despaire. Sab. You that so freely gave me Samorats life, Which was in danger, Most justly, justly may be suffer'd to attempt Upon my love, which is in none. Pr. What sayes my noble Rivall? Sab. Sir, y'are kind in this, and wisely doe Provide I should not surfeit: For here is happines enough besides to last the Sun's returne. N. You and I are but savers with all this Pellegrin. But by the Lord 'tis well we came off As we did, all was at stakeâ Pr. Come, no more whispers here, Let's in, and there unriddle to each otherâ For I have much to aske. Or. A Life! a Friend! a Brother! and a Mistres! Oh! what a day was here: Gently my Joyes distill, Least you should breake the Vessell you should fill. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. And how, and how, in faith,âa pretty plot; And smartly carried through too, was it not? And the Devils, how, well? and the fighting, Well too;âa foole, and't had bin just old writing. O what a monster-wit must that man have, That could please all which now their twelve pence gave: High characters (cries one) and he would see Things that ne're were, nor are, nor ne're will be. Romances cries easie-soules, and then they sweare, The Playe's well writ, though scarce a good line's there. The WomenâOh if Stephen should be kil'd, Or misse the Lady, how the plot is spil'd? And into how many pieces a poore Play Is taken still before the second day? Like a strange Beauty newly come to Court; And to say truth, good faith 'tis all the sport: One will like all the ill things in a Play, Another, some o'th' good, but the wrong way; So from one poore Play there comes t'arise At severall Tables, severall Comedies. The ill is only here, that 't may fall out In Plaies as Faces; and who goes about To take asunder oft destroyes (we know) What altogether made a pretty shew. FINIS.</field>
