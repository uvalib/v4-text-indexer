      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, Mecca.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Palace. Sopheian and Caled. Soph. Now, by the soul of our great father Ishmael, This is not faith, but wonderful conviction. Softâlet me sum thy reasons in my soulâ âNo GODS,â thou sayst, âbut One; One Power Supreme, âParent of nature! And, from him, one man, âParent of human kind, in whom united âMan grows to man, and still the social eye, âIn every face it meets, salutes a brother! âAnd then the fall of that unhappy parent, âSunk from his Paradise with all his sons, âAnd cast into a world of guilt and pain; âFrom whence restored, this Godhead in the breast, âSupports our frailty through the mortal war, âThat sense doth wage with virtue.â Cal. True, my lordâ This argues to the heart. Soph. It does, my Caled! Had man ne'er fallen, he had no sense of evil; No sense of good, if not redeemedâ'tis manifest! This solves the great Ã¦nigma of our natures; And, through the dusky maze of Providence, Leads forth to light. By outward revelation, Heaven answers to the truths revealed withinâ I feel their sacred force; and reason comes But as a second witness to confirm them. Cal. Nor reason onlyâuniversal nature Hath given authentic credence to her Lord, And vouch'd the word of our Eternal Prophet. Bards sung his future day; and ancient seers, Rapt through succeeding centuries, foretold The story of his timeâTo greet his birth, Angelic choirs made jubilee on earthâ Before him shrunk the powers of hellâThe sea Smooth'd at his bidding, and the storm was hush'd Attentive to his voiceâAt his approach, The lame sprung forward, and the blind man gazed With new-created organs! Soph. Yet, my friend, Even all his mighty works to me import, But as they greatly serve to authorize The mightier words he utter'dâAs the eye Bears witness to the light, or the charm'd ear To tuneful undulation; so my heart Strikes unison to his great Law of Love, And proves their source the sameâI own his mission, And all my country's gods fall down before him. Cal. Then let thy faith instruct thee to contemn This modern fableâthis God Mahomet, Who boasts the attribute of power, yet wars With wisdom, as with mercy. Soph. O the robber! The curst impostor, whose all sensual heaven Is fix'd in lust, who claims his dire apostleship By blood and devastation!âSayst thou, Caled, Oppose him?âyes, the root of our antipathy Sinks to the center, and its future growth Must reach through all eternity. Cal. Alas! That starting tear implies a mournful meaning. Soph. O Caled, friend, thou seest a lonely man, Stript like a withering cedar on the hills, And shorn of every branch that once adorn'd him. Bitter remembrance!âStranger as thou art In fair Arabia, haply thou hast heard Of Ommia's royal house. Cal. I have, my lord. Soph. I'll tell thee thenâOf that thrice noble house, We were two brothers, Joseph and myself, The last surviving heirs, twinn'd in one womb, As nature had foreclosed our bond of amity, Made perfect e'er election. I, the elder; But in my birth and progress to the light, Seiz'd by my infant brother, not as though He would dispute precedence, but refused To part his consort: so, we grew together, Link'd through our wanton years, each will and wish As a new rivet to our closing souls, That mock'd at separation.âDost thou listen?â Cal. Even as the breathless night, when tuneful Philomel Doth lift her song to silence. Soph. Mark me, thenâ Ere we attain'd the ripening noon of life, Two sisters, of the princely tribe of Jocktan, Yet in the morn of their unveiling beauty, Engaged our love; Almeydab and Mamuna, Twinn'd as we wereâWe sued, prevail'd, and wedded; I to Almeydab, to Mamuna Joseph; Nor hence divided, but as numerous links, More strong and more enfoldedâDost remember? Cal. Not a word fallen. Soph. To fix this wondrous union, We did engage, when Heaven should bless our beds, Exchange of childrenâhis for mine, and mine For his, as more beloved. And, in short process, The fair Mamuna, my thrice lovely sister, Brought forth a son, the blooming Moawias, And gave him to my arms. Thus, Caled, thus, The human feelings, all the charities, That knit the social family of man, Were join'd to make me blestâto make me wretched! Cal. Alas! Soph. Dost say?âI see thy nature's touch'd. Cal. No, my good lordâa short lived weakness in me; I pray, proceed. Soph. O Caled, now my tale Must turn to tragic! for our loved Mamuna, Bursting the circle of that fond society, Sicken'd and diedâaround her memory, As statues for her tomb, sadly we sat, Conversing by our tears. My Joseph thenceâ Thence mine no moreâacquired I know not what Of distant gloom; grew alien to himself, To me, and to the worldâthen disappear'd, Made all search vain, and tore me from myself. Cal. O, most unkind!âno doubt, some deep occasionâ Soph. None given by me. Cal. What, none? Soph. So judge me, Heaven!â No, not in thoughtâIt was surmised indeedâ Cal. What? Soph. No matter whatâI would not task his memoryâ Cal. Nayâpray youâ Soph. 'Twas surmised, the bile of melancholy Had seiz'd his better man, engendering thoughts Foreign and crudeâtending, I know not how, To devious lust, and thirst of empire. Cal. Heavens!â Surmised, by whom? Soph. A faithful wretch he wasâ Hercides!âa kind inmate to us both, An ancient of our houseâ Cal. Said he of lust? Soph. Even of my wife and sceptre. Cal. O the powers! Soph. Thou seem'st concern'dâ Cal. O pity, that such brothersâ Pity, that villainyâthat two such brothers!â Pray, to your story.â Soph. To me and to Almeydab thus forsaken, Young Moawias was an only solace, A pleasant, yet a mournful monitor Of what his parents wereâAt length, our storm Of grief subsided; and my kind Almeydab Became the mother of a recent happiness, Even of a daughter fair: so, all again Was well, as hope might look for in the lots Of mortal dispensationâO, too well!â For so Heaven deem'dâ'Twas then that Mahomet First dared to broach his fable here in public. With indignation fired, through Mecca's gates I chased the fell impostor, who, belike, Although his godhead then was in its infancy, Retained his dark abettors even in Mecca: For, like a wolf, the midnight prowler came, In my own palace caught my hour of absence, Murder'd my babes, and on my nuptial couch Seiz'd my sole bliss, my loved, my lost Almeydab! Cal. Ha! sure he durst notâ Soph. Thanks to the blest protectress of my honour!â Yes, the infernal satyr!âbut Almeydab Broke from his grasp; and where the casement looks Upon the flint beneathâa fearful steep!â Headlong she dash'd her beauties, and expired A victim to her virtue! Cal. O Sopheian!â Thy cup of sorrow hath indeed been bitter, And thou hast drank it largely. Soph. Since that hour, I walk the world as in a wildernessâ No social face to chear! All nature seems As one unvaried blank, upon whose leaf No comfort can be writtenâsave of vengeance, And now 'tis in my grasp. Cal. On Mahomet?âwhat vengeance? Soph. As, near to Yathreb's forest, on a day I led some troops, a squadron crost my eye, Who bore the tyrant's standard: we engaged, And conquest crown'd my arms. Among the captives, There was a maid, whose loveliness disgraced The costly gems she wore; and but that memory Still holds Almeydab to my sight, this stranger Might stand unrivall'd forth. Three waining moons She lies my prisoner, tho' in silken bondage; But, yesternoon, a slave betray'd her birth, And shews her for the daughter of the tyrant. Cal. Of Mahomet? Soph. Of himâThink, what should follow! Cal. In truth I am to seekâ Soph. Just retributionâ Revenge!â Cal. On whom, and wherefore?âReason, honour, Humanity, forbid!âConsult your heart, And say what that advises. Soph. O, I own, That, till I knew her for the tyrant's offspring, A kind of soft enchantment stole upon me; Some secret power, unweeting, drew my steps, To gaze upon her with a parent's fondness. Then as she look'd and spoke, my tears swell'd upwardâ And oft with pain I've check'd these aged arms, That long'd to clasp her with a chaste embrace. But see, she comes!âobserve her near, my Caled. Cal. To sight she is a wonder. SCENE II. To them Palmyra. Pal. Fair morning to my lord! May Heaven, each day, With early gratitude expand my heartâ Thus give me to approach, in humble duty, And pour my thanks before you! Soph. Why, Palmyra!â Sit thy chains light? Pal. As on a fluttering bird, Caged only to be cherish'dâsuch kind cares As suit the hovering goodness of a father, Have sooth'd my griefs, and made my bonds a blessing. Soph. Not such the measure, which thy father gave To my unhappy children!â Pal. Ha!âmy father? Soph. YesâMahomet! Pal. Nay, then, I am betray'd; And mercy shall no longer know Palmyra. Soph. Alas, fair innocent! though I should plant Thy sufferings thick as grain, what fruits would grow? My joys must still lie fallowâWill thy blood Make the cold tomb conceive, the grave to quicken, And yield Almeydab backâgive back my babe, My young Ayetia to my arms? O, never!â My comforts, with my wife and children, lie Too deep interr'd, and will return no more.â Dismiss thy fears, thou art guiltless of my griefsâ From other hands than mine, my child, expect Afflictions when they fall. Pal. Thus, grateful, as to Heaven, I bend with praisesâ [Kneels. For O, whate'er my different faith may dictate, My heart informs, that, of that Heaven, you are The most excelling pattern! Do not think Your slave depraved from truth; truth sits secure Within my soul, and mocks the reach of bondage! Hence am I free to tell you, that my heart Ne'er felt like awful love, like tender reverence, Not for my proper fatherâYetâmy lord, There is a causeâthere is a cause, my lord!â Soph. O, rise, sweet maid! command, nay task my powerâ 'Tis thine to its extent. Pal. Unhappy I, Who, now profess'd the daughter of your foe, Must stir your soul, by my detested sight, To grievous recollection; a dire monitor Of the sad source from whence your losses spring, Fretting your smoothest hour!âAh, royal sir, There's yet a bashful causeâelse, witness Heaven! No choice of mine to partâReturn me, then, Restore me to my kindred; take, in lieu, Cities and scepter'd nationsâMahomet Weighs not the ransom by my little worth, But by his large affectionâthen return me, Restore me toâO sir!â Soph. Unkind Palmyra!â Thy sire hath store of wives and little ones; Me he bereaved of allâand one for all, I only covet one from his abundance. Henceforth be thou my childâthat Power, who sees And winds the secret springs of human passions, He knows we must not partâ'tis death alone, The last sad hour, shall tear thee from Sopheian! Enter a Messenger. Mess. My lord, the country westward, for some leagues, Is all in motion. Through Moradia's plain, Men hurry flocks and herds; their wives and children Scream in the rear, or goad their camels on, Laden with stuffs of price, or household lumber, Caught up in haste; all speeding toward the city. Soph. Whence the alarm? Mess. 'Tis said, that Mahometâ Soph. Sayst thou, that Mahomet?â Mess. Yea, my good lord, attended by the nations, An army as the sands unnumber'd, comes, To add your Mecca to his length of conquest. Soph. Where be our treacherous scouts? How comes it thus, That notice slacks of duty?âFlyâawayâ Send me the captain of the watchâGood Caled, Speed to the several nobles of the city, And bid them to the senate; say, ourself Will haste to join themâSpeed, my friend! [Exit Caled. Who waits?â Enter Captain of the Watch. Captain, thy trust is great; so is our confidence, Alike reposing on thy faith and valour. Set up a double watch on Uzza's tower; See our gates closed; and, on the instant, cull A chosen band for the patroleâGood captain, Walk thou the round in person; if thou seest A face that catches at suspicion, seize, And bring him to our presence. [Exit Captain. Enter another Messenger. Nowâwhat's the tidings? Mess. Mahomet, my lord, Greets you by his ambassador. Soph. Conduct himâ Thou mayst retire, my child; whate'er arrives, Thou shalt partake it truely. [Exit Palmyra. SCENE III. Sopheian alone. So, now 'tis comeâthy will, Omnipotence! For thou dost rule the hour, wherein Sopheian, Or his great foe, must fall!âIf human justice Might now decideâbut O, 'tis weak, 'tis shallowâ Thy judgments sink an infinite beneath, And mock the mortal fathom!â He comes, the ambassadorâha! on my credence, And shews a presence, that, from ruder ears, Might well bespeak his hearing! SCENE IV. To Sopheian, Zaphna. Zaph. Thus Heaven's interpreter, to great Sopheian, Sends peace, forerunning peace. Soph. I see his policyâ Where such angelic envoys lead his mission, He would insinuate that a god must follow. What would this new divinity? Zaph. My lord, Spare mockery!âTo any, save Sopheian, We should reply in thunderâbut, to you, Soft as the southern breeze!âTo you, great Mahomet Sends invitation, unity of souls, And greeting, given as to a second son Of high appointing Heaven!âHe bids you share Dominion, and the glorious toils that wait The reformation of the world, the fellowship Of faith, and heavenly missionâ Soph. Faith, what faith?â Mission from whom?â Zaph. From that Omnipotence, Whose power invests him to the darken'd world. As when some comet, with portentous blaze, Springs from the west, and flames around the globe; So moves the sword of our illustrious Prophet, Suspended o'er the nations! Soph. Is terror then the only attribute That cloaths your Prophet?âSpeak, what wonders wait him? Will the dead hear his voice, will nature bend Obsequious to his bidding? By what seal Doth Heaven attest his embassy? Zaph. By conquest! Soph. So earthquakes yawn, to swallow nations up; Volcanos rage, and wasting plagues advance, Commission'd to destruction! Zaph. Mahomet Will best resolve those doubtsâbut, for the present, He bids your gates unfold to his approach, And that Sopheian meet his terms of love With answering amity. Soph. Bear back his greeting; And tell the robber, that Sopheian's answer Lies in his sword. Zaph. You have a captive. Soph. True. Zaph. A fair one. Soph. So I think her. Zaph. What's her ransom? Soph. I weigh not worth with goldâto me she seems Above all price; and Mahomet must find New worlds to conquer, 'ere he can redeem her. Zaph. That reverend formâpatience!âthou canst not meanâ Say, by what right thou darest to detain her? Soph. Even by that right, young man, by which your Prophet Claims universal monarchyâby conquest!â Zaph. Know you her birth?âknow you her merits? Soph. Yesâ She is your Sultan's daughter, and my slaveâ [Zaphna puts his hand to his sword. What wouldst thou, boy? Shall I not use my slave? Hath not your pious Mahomet his Haram, Where, while on earth, he antedates his heaven, In all the lusts of his luxuriant riots? Zaph. You would notâdurst not!âBut I'm cool againâ Did not the law of nationsâ Soph. O, 'tis wellâ I like thy spirit, child; and, though I hold her Prized as my realm, I do approve thee yet A mate to her best worth. Zaph. You mock your servant. Soph. No, by my life! Zaph. O sir, how low, how humbled, The frail, rash, heady thing, this toy of youth, When shown, and shrunk in your superior presence! But, by that awful virtue, I conjure you, Which guards your form, and opens in your aspect, Do not despise my tearsâIs she not?âOâ Soph. Yes, by my honour, I do think her pure, Even as the rose of spring, whose folded bloom Ne'er open'd to the breeze. Zaph. When time will serve, My life shall thank you for itâO Sopheian! Let me, now, step a minister of peace, Between your virtue and our conquering Prophet; Before whose power, the kingdoms of the earth Bend like the bladed harvest!âAt his touch, Your walls must crumble, and your palaces Sink to the pavementâGrant him but a conference. Soph. Never. Zaph. Then thus he speaks his last decreeâ If not the peaceful terms of pious friendship, Nor yet the dread of our impending arm, Can bend the flinty temper of Sopheian; If not the wealth of rifled provinces, Can bribe him to resign Palmyraâthen, Soph. Thenâwhat must follow? Zaph. Bid him, then, beware The fate of his own children! Soph. Amazement! What children, sayst thou? Zaph. Trust me, sir, He vows, by all the sanctities of Heaven, They both are living. Soph. Living?âsaid you, living? My children!âboth my children!âwhere?âO miracle!â Indulgent powers!âWhat country?âhave you seen them? My son and daughter too?âAlasâperhaps Exposed to wretchedness, opprest with bondage!â Inform me, youthâmy children, my dear infants!â Zaph. Ye powers, how kindred are the soft delights, That flow from nature's feelings!âSacred sir, 'Tis sure your children are most safeâthe rest Will be declared at meeting. Soph. Haste, kind youthâ Yes, we may meetâthe safety of my little ones Hath whiten'd half his crimesâBut mark me well, For yet I trust not to your Prophet's faith, Or his high boasted fableâbid his army Repose beyond the plain; he may, in person, Enter with due attendance, and my honour With equal hostages shall be impawn'd, For his return in safety. Zaph. Well, I trust, Your terms shall meet acceptance. Soph. Further yetâ To shew, brave youth, the passion thou'st betray'd For our fair captive, moves no jealous bearing; Palmyra shall prepare for thy return, And in my palace wait a private hearing. Zaph. All thanks are poorâO, may your eyes, with joy, From those, your lost and found, your twice born infants, Behold a line of princes! May you live Till honour can admit of no increase, And years dismiss you to the grave in peace! [Exeunt. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Palace. Palmyra and Zaphna meet. Zaph. Palmyra!â Pal. Zaphna!â Zaph. Do I hear that voice?â Do I then hold thee? gaze upon those eyes, That open their returning dawn upon me?â O my life's life!â'twas a long night of absence, And busied in such dreams of dire distraction, As thus to see thee could alone compensateâ Thus, thus to wake in bliss!â Pal. My love, my Zaphna! My fears for you were twice my own distress; For here, within, a friend of your's was busy, Who guess'd your pains, and number'd all your sufferings. Zaph. Would you believe I could survive in pangs, Greater than what expiring wretches feel In the last struggle, when the soul is parting? And yet, I know not how, some strengthening power Whisper'd a hope, and bid your Zaphna live. Pal. Blest be that power, for sure he meant this meeting! And, O my Zaphna, were my choice consulted, Better to die a thousand deaths together, Than live to part again. Zaph. Part?âno, Palmyra!â That hopes makes all my happiness on earth, In death my comfort, and my heaven hereafter. Well did the faith of thy foreseeing father, Fill up his blest eternity with loveâ Then, as my fair Palmyra stood before him, He caught the vision of celestial beauty, And drew his future paradise from thee! Pal. Delightful flattery!âAnd yet, my Zaphna! Who knows but Heaven, indulgent to my wishes, May, in the region of exalted charms, Improve the pittance of Palmyra's beauty, And make me worthy thy immortal passion? But tell me, hast thou seen Sopheian?âSay, Will he restore me to my wonted happiness, Once more to liberty, to love, and Zaphna? Zaph. So stands my hopeâthe reverend sire consents To render back thy beauties, in exchange For his own children. Pal. Are they living, then? O the good man!âMethinks I see their meetingâ The royal parent, in his tears majestick, Suspended o'er his children; and the joy, The extasy, my Zaphna, of those orphans, Restored to such a father! Zaph. Ahâour soulsâ How much the same! thy very thoughts are mine And my heart melts with my Palmyra's softness. A kindred feeling tooâmyself an orphan, Dropt, as the Prophet saith, amid the storm Of some sack'd town, the child of war and chance, Not worth a further search; and yet aspiring To thee, bright daughter of the Dawn of Truthâ Star of that Heaven, who constitutes thy sire The Angel of his word! Pal. Thou art, my Zaphna, Sufficient to thyself; the mighty heir Of thy own virtues, seated firm and high O'er all that's built upon the failing props Of birth and empire!âArt thou not the arm Of my great sire, Heaven's substituted bolt, Wherewith our Prophet strikes the prostrate world? Zaph. There is a fearâthere is a fear, Palmyra!â The thought hath open'd such a gulph before me, That my mind, plunging down her own conception, Pre-occupies perdition.â Pal. What's so high, Whereto my hero may not lift his hope?â What has he, then, to fear? Zaph. Returning late, From Tabuc, Dauman, Eyla, by my arms Subduedâall flush'd, and rapid on my way, The Prophet met me; caught me to his breast; And, ere I bow'd myself to due prostration, âZaphna,â he cried, âmy Zaphna, by that power âWho leads the leaders of our host! demand, âAnd take thy wish.ââAs sudden, I repliedâ âPalmyra is the daughter of our Prophet!ââ I spoke, and sought the earthâDeep silence follow'dâ When to my lifted eye, his cheek, all pale, Usurp'd a transient smile, to smooth his answer: âI see,â he cried, âI see that hour at hand, âWherein thou wilt unthread this rash request, âAnd flee whom now thou followest!â Pal. Ah, undone! If Zaphna can be doom'd to such a treason. Zaph. Forbear, my love!âto me wouldst thou imputeâ Urge not to frenzyâTo thy other creatures, Give other blessings, Heaven! thou know'st that Zaphna Can taste but oneâIn her, as in the grave, Is every sense absorb'dâto my Palmyra To this sole point, whate'er I build for hope, Here or hereafter, comesâsap me this prop, Heaven, earth, and all, are hurried from existence, And Zaphna sinks for ever! Pal. Then, what more? Since that our hearts are ratified above, Ere aught below should wrest the sacred knot, I'd prove a parent to my own affections, And give where Heaven appoints. Zaph. Wilt seal that compact? Pal. Yes. Zaph. Nearly? [Opens his arms. Pal. Dearly seal it! [They embrace. Zaph. O the rapture!â I doubt my timeâthe Prophet's on his wayâ He will'd me to attend him 'ere his entrance, And thence return the hostage of his faith To Mecca's chief. Pal. What here? Zaph. To thee, my love! Pal. Let it be soon, my Zaphna. Zaph. Soul of my soul, even wing'd by my own wishes! Adieuâ Pal. May the good angels quit all other charge, To take thee to their keeping. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. A Street in Mecca. Several Peasants enter. 1st. Peas. What says Maister Gubbin to this? âWhat says our friend, Maister Gubbin? Gubb. As for me, neighboursâlook yeâI am out of the point. I have a dispensation from religion âmy grandfather was a nobleman's bastard, and I am a freethinker by descent. 2d Peas. O, here comes the doctor! he'll truss you, and discuss you, from the twirl of a thread to the twist of a cable. Mob. Welcome, doctor; kindly welcome, doctorâ Doct. Good morrow Mr. Gubbin! A jovial company, friendsâhow got you together? Gubb. Like geese to a pond, doctor; they come to be dabblingâThe affair, as they tell me, is this. The gods have sent their child Mahomet to them, post from heaven, on a great hobby-horse; and as he comes so long a journey, and on an errand from their betters, they seem inclined to give him a civil receptionâ Mob. Ay, ay, that's it, that's it!â Doct. But neighboursâdo you know on what errand it is that this same Mahomet comes?â 1st Peas. I think, some say, it be religionâ Mob. Ay, by all means, religionâit is religion. Doct. But what is religion, my friends?â Neighbour Dolt, what sayst thou to it? Dolt. Why religion isâas tho'f I should say of honest Hobson here, that he is, do ye mark meâa religious manâor indeed, and as if it were, a man of religionâ Gubb. Ha, ha, ha! Doct. Most specifically definedâAnd truly, Mr. Dolt, I find thou hast as much learning by nature, as I got from logics and all the universities âreligion, in general, is, as thou saystâBut can any of you define me his own religion?âWhat is the religion here in Mecca. Gubb. Now you pose 'em, doctor. Mob. No, no, that we cannot. Dolt. That were a moot point indeedâcrack me that nut who canâ Doct. Go to then,âthat can Iâthe religion of Mecca is a suit of cloaths. Mob. A suit of cloaths! Doct. Ay marry is it, and the priest is the taylorâ Mob. And the priest the taylor!âGoodâgood âvery goodâ Doct. Now you, who can afford no better, may have but one suit of the same cut and fashion for life; there's not a thread in it but appears to every eyeâyou eat, you work, you sleep in the same; and where it does not keep you warm, it will certainly shew your nakedness. Mob. That's true, doctorâthat's very true, indeedâand ingenious. Doct. Well, what shall I say then to the religion of your betters, but that it is cut out and prank'd into infinite disguises? it seems fashioned for the adorning of nature, but is used for the hiding of deformities.âIn the law, it is truely a long suit, a suit whereof the lawyers have stript their clients; behind the counter, it is a covering for knavery; to the ass of state, it is a robe of solemnity; and is, indeed, sincere in none, save your gallants of the mode, who are themselves, as their dress, things of shew, orânothing. Gubb. Ha, ha, ha!â Mob. A wise manâa parlous wise man!â Dolt. But, doctorâ Doct. Ay neighbour, what sayst? Dolt. Did this same Mahomet drop from the clouds? Doct. Marry, and that he didâwhile he was snug at home, and asleep in his bed. Dolt. Now that's very straynge! Mob. Very straynge and wonderful! Dolt. Pray ye, what was this same Mahomet? Doct. Truely he was once a man of little weight, a carrier of some light peddling fooleries; but now he will carry you nineteen kingdoms upon his own shoulders. Mob. Main strongâa main strong man! Dolt. But, doctorâ Doct. Say it, good fellow. Dolt. Is he notâmercy on usâwhat call you it, that tells all past fortunes? Doct. O, a prophet, a prophetâ Dolt. Ay, what says the prophet? what says he, pray you? Doct. That if you will not believe in his doctrine, he will knock out thy brainsâand that now is marvellous, how he should know thou hast anyâ Mob. Heâheâhe!âvery marvellous; very marvellous, indeed. Dolt. But have you any inkling of this Prophet's doctrine, as they call it? Doct. Ayâthere truly he comes near me, as it were, in my own professionâHe tells you that the mind of man is subject to many diseases and weaknesses. Mob. Ay, which be they, doctor? which be they, good doctor? Doct. Even the weakness of your poor hearts, that keep a foolish kindness for your neighbours; a bit for the hungry, and a tear for the afflicted. Mob. Ay, heaven help us, we are wicked souls, to be sure!â Gubb. Alas, good creaturesâ Doct. All these now he cures by contrary habits and exercise: he teaches you to cut throats, plunder houses, ravish maidens, sack towns, waste provinces; and, when you are perfect in all these virtues, he leads you to his own paradise, where you are to rant, and drink, and whore, for ever. Dolt. Whoy!âHeaven may be vast koind in all this, to be sure; but it goes sore against the grain of us poor sinners. Gubb. This comes of your want of education, my neighbours, which is a great misfortune to you. Now we, who draw near to higher life, as they call it, shall lack but little reformation. Dolt. But has he no arguments, doctor? One would be glad to hear a little reason, as the saying is. [Drums and Trumpets. Doct. Here he comesâDo ye not hear reason in the sound of his trumpets! Why, he has a hundred thousand arguments at his back, the least of which will decide against the keenest casuist in all Arabia. SCENE III. Mahomet carried in a triumphal chariot by several slaves crowned, his captains, &amp;c. attending. The Mob divide, and, as he advances, range on each side of the stage, and fall prostrate. Maho. People of Mecca, rise!âyour day is come. Ye favour'd of the Heavensâmy chosen brothersâ Last call'd, yet first regarded!âsee ye not, As at the prayer of our primÃ¦val sire, Of Adam, first of men, your Caaba, Your temple, once of golden architrave, Dropt by the wondring stars in sheets of light, Fram'd by angelic buildersâsee ye not Like glory now descending!âLong in night, More dark and blacken'd by the guilt of man, Did Mecca lie entranced, even from the flood, Wherein her sacred temple was o'erthrown, With nature suffering wreckâtill Abraham, Great father of our father Ishmael, Directed by a star, the holy Sheckinah, As twilight glimmering through a dusky world, Here built again your sacred fane, restored Of gross materialsâtrueâbut more debased, By future profanationâpagods foul, The abomination of the times!âYet, Mecca! Arise as from the tombâthou favourite city, Arise as from the tomb!âThy hour is come, When this, thy hallow'd temple, shall be cloath'd With more than pristine glory!âToward the sun, As when the Persians eastward bend their heads To his uprising beam, so, turn'd to thee, And to thy Caaba, the nations round, East, west, and north, and south, a prostrate world, Shall bend the distant knee!âBeholdâthe light, The light is come upon yeâborn by me, Heaven's present Angel!â The Mob shout, and cry, A Mahomet! a Mahomet! a Prophet! a present Prophet! and again fall prostrate. SCENE IV. Enter Sopheian. Soph. O profanation!âHell, thy minister Usurping godhead, and prostration due But to the highest!âCan I bear it?âShall aught That's mortal, sway to this?âMy children, pardon!â You are but twoâthese thousands, these seduced, My people, and my children tooâAway, Conforming baseness! duty, to thy taskâ Let Heaven provide events! Mahomet descends from his throne and advances toward Sopheian. Maho. Hail to the prince of Mecca! thrice all hail To Heaven's appointed, to our future Prophet, Assumed to sacred ministry, the seal And brother of our word! Soph. Away, impostor! Confusion to thy greeting!âIs it thus Thou didst propose to treat? by sap and lure, Thou subtle miner? didst thou hope, vain man! I'd barter truth for treason?ânever, never!â I will not set my subjects to the sale, Sons of my trust, for whom my years have travail'd! Out of my realm, thou scepter'd vagrantâhence! Maho. Stop, stop the bolt, ye ready ministers! Nor strike mistaking blasphemyâO stop, I do arrest your arm!âKnow you not, then, That Heaven hath steel'd the heart of this his chosen, In him to shew the wonders of his might, By quick conversion?â Soph. O wily serpent!âbut I'll cross thy windings, Even in their proper mazeâMy gentle people! List not to this bad manâI am like yourselves, Simple and plain, and of such level sense As Heaven gives honesty.âThis arch-deceiver Doth say he's from above; so you, or I, Might say with equal rightâwho saw him go, Or come from thence? If this is Heaven's ambassador, Ask him for his credentialsâWho so simple, To give the slightest value of his purse, Less the rich worth of his eternal faith, Upon a wordy tale, no character No token vouching?âBid the juggler shew, At least, some tricks, some slightings of his art, To dust our eye of reason. Maho. The deep Serene moves not at idle breath; Nor will Heaven deign, by frolic, to indulge The wantonness of man. His Prophets come, Each vested in the proper attribute That doth attest his mission. Noah so Came cloath'd in justice, and in clemency The son of Amram; Solomon in wisdom! But, vested in the wonders of his power, The last and mightiest, I! Soph. His power!âwherein exprest? Maho. The world hath felt the lightning of my eye, And thunder of my arm! Soph. Such was the claim of Ammon's boasted son; Such Nero's, when he ript his mother's entrails, And laughing set his native Rome on fire; Prophets and plagues alike!âBend, bend, my people! Kneel to this pestilence, this fiend sent forth To blast fair nature.âHeaven! thy worshippers Do thank thee for creationâwho is, then, This image of thy power revers'd? his task To uncreate; depopulate and waste The beauty of thy works! Maho. Defamer, no!â For to the faithful I promulge glad tidings, Due trophies, glory won of high exploits; Good things on earth, and endless joys hereafter. Soph. Have we then chaced thee to thy paradise, Thou jolly Prophet?âstill, the flowing bowl, The feast, the rolling eye, and wanton touch, To stir decaying appetite above!â Yet art thou just in this; thy followers, First taught to cast humanity aside, Are then rewarded with the bliss of brutesâ Fit heaven to fit earth!âlust, earn'd by blood! Maho, Curse on thy sophistry!âDost thou not know, The ways of sense are all the avenues That lead to knowledge? all the modes, whereby Or earth or heaven can be reveal'd? Soph. 'Tis false. The man is soul alone; a living soul! His senses, appetites, his body, all Scarce a thin surface to his deep existence; His slaves, detach'd for gross intelligence 'Twixt him and this slight world, his petty neighbour. His proper faculties are inward, all Internal to himself; the eye of reason, The touch that thrills humanity, the taste The appetite for goodness, whereupon This embryon angel feeds, as in his shell, Till fledg'd for Heavenâ Said I, the senses were the slaves of man? Too oft his tyrants, enemies at all times, To be opposed, subjected, and represt; Soul against sense to wage perpetual war, 'Till Heaven shall quit the lumber: 'tis the character That severs man from beast, andâsuch a Prophet! Maho. Damnation!âFiends and fire!âDown, down, ye thunders, Crush the blasphemer quick!âMark me, ye nations! Let late posterity attendâI come not In the weak coil of words, but strength of power; To quell with arms, not fence at argument. The world is warpt, and bids our flag expand, The bloody impress that shall seal our law, Even to the end of things!âWho carps, who cavils, I give his tortured carcass to impalement, His damned spirit to the deep!âAwayâ To arms, brave Ali!âto our hostâlead onâ The morrow's sun beholds the truce expired, And Mecca in the dust!âGoâleave meâ [His attendants retire. Soph. Go, my people! [Peasants retire. SCENE V. Mahomet and Sopheian for some time continue silent, Mahomet looking stern, and Sopheian with a contemptuous smile. Soph. Prophet, thou art movedâ Maho. Sopheian! Soph. Say. Maho. I came to thee in peaceâthou hast murder'd peace! I did intend thee honours, that might strain The eye to upward gazingâThy loved children, Even as my own, I've foster'dâ Soph. That, indeed, bends to thy service. Maho. Hell! dost talk of service? Thou hast exposed and set at nought my mission! There's but one wayâ Soph. Declare. Maho. Embrace it instantlyâ Soph. If notâ Maho. Thou art a wretched father!â Soph. Ha!â Maho. And that lone trunk descends into the dust, No twig surviving. Soph. Thou art not such a devil. Maho. Dost thou not know me? Soph. O, too well! Maho. Enoughâ Soph. Thou wouldst not yetâthou art, thyself, a father! Thy child too in my powerâbeware of that!â Maho. Fool, fool, to tempt me soâI dare thy utmost; For thou art good, and can'st not swerve a hair From the kind milk of nature. Soph. Art inexorable? Take back thy child; with her my gems, my storesâ Strip all, save that which will not profit thee, A little truth to cloath me. Maho. 'Tis in vainâ Soph. Let me but see themâ'tis not much to grantâ But once to fold them in a father's bosom, A first and last embrace! Maho. Yesâwhen thy son is writhing on the pale, Wound up to agony; and thy chaste girl To my licentious soldiers cast abroad, As prostituted airâthenâ Soph. O miserable!â Idol of terrors, mighty fiend, yet holdâ [As Sopheian speaks, he catches at Mahomet, and bends towards him in a supplicating posture. Maho. What! have I found thee At my feet, mine enemy?â Ha, ha, ha, ha!âTen thousand curses catch thee! [Exit. Soph. The powers of hell are pitiless; and Heaven, Where pity is, we make our last resource, When else no arm can aidâO children, children! Your fate is urgent; and the bolt once launch'd, What prayer can intercept?âYes, to Omnipotence, That instant may be spun into an age, For grace to intervene. O, then, be quickâ Let thy swift power fill up my weak dependence! Upon him, down! o'ertake him in the midst Even of his proud career! his broad blown glories, O blast them, blast the tyrant! staunch the sluice Of the wide bleeding world, this day, this hour! And let the faith of erring mortals know, 'Tis Heaven that winds thro' every path below. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Zaphna and Palmyra on one side, and Sopheian slowly on the other. Zaph. Joy to our generous hostâpeace and her train, I trust, are near!âHa, if I judge aright, Joy hath no dwelling hereâthey are the characters Of grief and deep dismay, that may be read Throughout that reverend form!âSay, royal sir, Have you not met? Soph. Yes, Zaphna. Zaph. Treated? Soph. Yes. Zaph. And how? Soph. What boots the tale?â Zaph. I doubt, my lordâ Pray pardon,âthat your port hath haply seem'd Too much aloft, unbending to our Prophet; For I did hear him, with an ample heart, Speak of dear terms, and purposed good toward you. Soph. I did descend beneath a low man's level; Besought, with tears besought him, for my children, Even at his knee. Pal. O grace!âand what hath chanced? Soph. Perhaps even now my son is on the pale; And the chaste honours of my dearer daughter, Thrown to the public camp. Pal. And did you then, Forget Palmyraâwhen the chains of one Might ransom both your children? Soph. I did add Even all my treasures in exchange. Pal. Ah, Heaven!â I have then no fatherâZaphna, thou art all, The only friend that's left! Zaph. Royal Sopheianâ I am your hostage; and, where I'm known, my honour Unquestion'd as the light. I am more than hostage, Bound from my soul to your best vantage everâ I have served our Prophet from the earliest hour, That arms e'er cloath'd an infant; a slight boast, To say he's yet my debtor. I will seek him, I will invest me with your suitâmeanwhile My faith remains your surety. Soph. Generous youth! Goâand the blessings of a forlorn father Still wait on thee my son. Zaph. Peace be your guest! A quick return shall meet your amplest wishes. [Exit Zaphna. Pal. Alas! my lord, and hath my once fond father Cast off his child? could a short absence thus Efface great nature's impress? Soph. Though I menacedâ Heaven knows how distant from my heart!âto use thee Below thy least deservings.â Pal. Could I think it?â When memory goes back to its first stage, It meets his kindness there, which thence came onward, Encreasing as my days. My prate alone Could cast his care, new form his face to smiles; I seem'd his little mint for daily pleasures, Lived at his knee, and grew but in his eye. Can I forget with what continued rapture, He since hath caught and held me to his bosom, As from his being I were once again To take new root? Soph. He knew, he knew, Palmyra! Nature, tho' turn'd to savage, could not hurt thee: Thence grew his confidenceâAnd yet, sweet maid, Would I might wean thee to my own affection! For much I fear thy fatherâmuch I fear, No child of mine shall close my eyes in death, Twice born, and now twice buried. Pal. O, my master! Should a hair fall that hangs upon your peace, On his own daughter, even upon myself, I'll do you vengeance. Soph. Generous, gentle heart!â Come, my best child, and while our Zaphna's absent, Let's wear the hour, and mingle hope with tears; Weep where we must, but smile whene'er we can, Since woeful is the state ordain'd for man. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Mahomet's Pavilion. Mahomet and Caab. Maho. No, CaabâIf I forgive him!â No moreâhis doom is seal'd; for on his head My greatness can alone take future growth, Or needs must wither. Didst thou mark?â Caab. I didâ The imbitter'd envy of his taunts, the insolence Of his imagined triumph. Maho. Curse on his triumph! it shall sink him, Caab!â My friend, I'll tell thee of this same Sopheian: From the first pluming of my young ambition, He check'd its flight; in war, in prophecy, My deadliest lett! In vain I sought his friendship; He mock'd my dreams, and vilified my person. 'Twas needful, yet, to win him by my arts, Or crush him by my arms. The last was doubtfulâ And, therefore, to retain within my hands A certain pledge of our projected amity, I seiz'd the lucky vantage of an hour, And stole his childrenâ Caab. Whom! Maho. Be secret then, Till time shall speakâeven Zaphna and Palmyra!â Caab. Say you, my lord, the children of Sopheian? Maho. The same; and for that purpose brought them up With all due preference; nay, loved them, Caabâ And from the dawn of young Palmyra's beauties, Won by I know not what of infant sweetness, I mark'd her for my bed; a favourite consort, To give age appetite. But now, my Caab, I hate them both, the hostile progeny Of that old canker'd stock! yet, for Palmyra, There is a sort of malicious kindness, That suits our hatred well. I must enjoy herâ I else come short of my own paradise, A Prophet to no end. Caab. My lord! Maho. Say, Caab. Caab. Think you, but if Sopheian knew the honours You did intendâ Maho. No more! I see 'tis vain. The fellow is in earnest; has ta'en up Whims of I know not what, call'd truth and honestyâ A fool, and bigot! Caab. Yet, such weak propensities Have mainly serv'd our Prophet. Maho. True, my oracleâ Though rancourous enemies when once attack'd, They make fast friends. Why, what a deal of people Have we religion'd into mischief, Caabâ To what the dictates of plain nature call Theft, murder, rapine, sacrilege!âyet these Have fashion'd all our heroes, set at gaze The demigods of old. Caab. Now, from my soul, I do adore you; worship you with heart Of true recognizance. Your wisdom sums Whate'er of power, or elevated attribute, Is fabled in divinity. Maho. Mark, Caab! Would'st thrive on earth, appear to look at Heaven, As that were all thy bent; the seeming saint Still makes the prosperous sinner. 'Tis therefore, that, Prometheus-like, I've robb'd Heaven's altar of enthusiastic fire, And have my fasts, my prayers, my zeal, and cant, Spread hands, and whited eye-ballsâmorals too, Good morals, Caab! that have made good men. My godship to a bett, but I, hereafter, May have my martyrs tooâWhat say'st thou, Caab? For, on my soul, I do begin to think, I have but dream'd of sleighting on the world, And that I am sent indeed. Caab. Most high and mighty! 'Tis better as it isâfor Heaven, belike, Had given less latitude. Maho. Say'st thou, old chronicle? Ha, ha, ha, ha!âBut to our theme, my friend. What with Sopheian? Caab. Bring your army on. Maho. That has its hazard. Caab. Poison thenâ Maho. A daggerâ Caab. A gentle cupâ Maho. Blood, Caab, blood! Caab. My lord, you know I'm for the cabinet; The sword's too bare a province. Maho. Yet, my Caab, Thou couldst persuadeâ Caab. Whom? Maho. Aliânoâwhat thinkst of Abdoramen? Caab. It will not do; he's not enough of saint, Nor yet of sinner for itâSay, 'twere Zaphna. Maho. Ha!âyesâI do conceiveâO glorious mischief!â Come to my arms thou prophet of thy prophet!â Zaphna hath such a gallantry of zeal, Bid him but on, and in the name of Heaven, He'd strike at Heaven's SupremeâThis way, this way, More from the lightâuntil I pour into thee, The horrors that are brooding in my soul, To whelm our foes withal. Caab. Pardon, my lordâ I did not thinkâthis will be parricide. Maho. Out foolâthe nobler vengeance!âFurther, Caab,â I have a lure to bow this youthful eagle, A tempting lureâhe loves Palmyraâso, The sister's body for the father's blood! It is a bargain seal'dâBut ere he seize His quarry, we must gorge himâthere's thy taskâ 'Tis but the sweet'ning of the sacred chalice, The cup of our commission, and all's safeâ Then Caab we shall mount as free as air, To love and empire. Caab. I do think, my master, If Zaphna does the feat, it were not safe He live to rue; they both must fall together. Maho. RightâThis once done, thou art thy master's master. Ha! by my missionâto our wishâhe comesâ Keep thee aside, my Caab. [Caab retires. SCENE III. Mahomet retires to his chair; and, as Zaphna enters, affects to be wrapt in a vision. Maho. Thy will!âin patience I resign me to itâ What, Zaphna! is it Zaphna thou hast chosen, To be the voice, as now he is the arm To propagate thy word?âI envy notâ I pityâZaphnaâO my son, my son, The toils that win the trophies!âthou art young, Unequalâpardon, Heavenâthy might, it is Sufficient to himâWhat a combat first Must wring his heart!âtorn from itselfâthe will, Self-will rent from himâby the will above Supply'dâI seeâhe draws the sword of Heavenâ He strikesâThe foe is fallenâ'tis finish'd! While Mahomet speaks, Zaphna stands amazed and agitated with various emotions; then speaks, and falls prostrate.â Zaph. Thine and thy prophet's will, Behold your servant! [After a silent pause, Mahomet pretends to awake, and seeing Zaphna, seems surprized.â Maho. HowâZaphna! What dost thou here, young man? Thou art a hostageâ Zaph. 'Tis therefore I am come, my gracious master, A suitor for my hostâ Maho. Rise, Zaphna!âNoâ 'Tis strangeâ'tis mysticalâ'tis wond'rous all!â Thy doing!âno, my childâfor thou art come Wide of thyself; thou know'st not when, nor whyâ Invisibly conducted. Zaph. Lo, great Prophet! Your servant's soul is wrapt in energyâ Strain'd to her wing, and panting for the flight, Where you and Heaven appoint. Maho. What wouldst thou? ha!â Zaph. The scythe-drawn sword, to dart amid the legions, Mow'd as the summer's weedâto plunge the flameâ To ride the whirlwindâcramp'd within the pole, To freeze, to shiver, in the eternal bite Of thawless winterâ Or boldly striding on the boist'rous surge, My watry Pegasus wing'd by the winds, To scale the pale-ey'd regent of the night, Revealing wonders! Maho. Aptâbut foreign quite!â Imagination hurries thee, my son, A thousand leagues asideâ'Tis not the plume Of new-fledg'd youth, the riot of the blood, Nor fiery sparks that mount upon the blaze Of hot ambition; fond conceptions all, The quickening of mortality!âNo moreâ Heaven is not in themâ'Tis a will debased, Sunk from itself; old nature turn'd and strain'd, From wonted bendings; judgment quelled, and reason Led as a muffled babeâ Zaph. O take me then, Crush me into oblivion, that no thought May rise to further ferment!â Maho. 'Tis amazingâ Prodigious, what's ordain'd for thee, my child! The greater heights, the lowlier thou must sink, Prepared for future soaring; be a thing Of scorn to what is call'd thy nobler nature, In thy own eye a base one. Zaph. O, pronounce!â I am already all that Heaven would have, Or nothingâ Maho. That Heaven thou servest, hath a foe. Zaph. A foe? Maho. A dog! Zaph. Perhaps, devotedâ Maho. Stab him. Zaph. Whom? Maho. Sopheian! Zaph. Ha! Maho. A scofferâ Zaph. Alas! Maho. A blasphemer of our law, Cursing the earth he treads!âThou musest, Zaphna. Zaph. Not Iânoâmuse, my lord?âI would, I would Be all obedience. Maho. Take this poniard to thee; 'Tis consecrated steelâand thou the priest Appointed to the sacrifice! Zaph. His children?â I trust not compass'd in the sire's offences. Maho. No, they are ta'en to graceâAway, dispatch, Or thou art lost for ever! Follow him, Caabâshould he fail, enforce him. [Exit Mahomet speaking to Caab. Zaph. Ha!âThoughts be stillâA traitorâmurdererâ A dark, a secret villain!âthere's the merit!â Down, down, rebellion!âNature, who art thou Whose sense would kick at Heaven? thou must thyself Be slain, the previous victim; else this steel Recoils, no purpose on the point. Help, Heaven!â Quick, Zaphna!âor the combat fought within, Kills the whole man; and power will be as weak As will, to this most dreadful taskâO misery? [Exit Zaphna. SCENE IV. Sopheian's Palace. Sopheian and Caled meet. Soph. Friend, are our gates secured, our guards disposedâ All measures ta'en against surprize or treachery, Where such an inmate nestles? Cal. All is done, What diligence could act, or prudence dictate.â The danger is not ours. Soph. How's that, my friend? Cal. The common croud, who ever loved your person, Wean'd of their superstitious awe of Mahomet By your last conference, have caught a rumour Touching your long lost children, and the danger That threatens at their lifeâAll fired, they run To corners, and in sudden whispers plot The fall of the Impostor and his followers. Soph. Ah Caled! wherefore do I know this business? Which known, I must prevent. Cal. 'Tis therefore told, To be preventedâ Soph. Does Christianity Enjoin such heights, stupendous to our natures? Cal. It doesâwhate'er of worth, truth, candour, honour, Can be selected and sublimed from things, Through the whole man it raises and expandsâ No out-let for evasion, no compounding! Your faith is pass'd; and, to your stretch of power, You are now the guardian of your foe. Soph. Yet, yet, I could have wish'dâ Cal. To what effect, Sopheian? The Almighty Faith of which thou art now professor, In the suspended arm of feeble man Arrests all power; and to itself assumes The scope of all events, even to a hair, Which on the unbonneted or hoary head Gives comfort against cold. Soph. And is it so? Cal. All known, all noted, balanced, and adjusted, As in a chymist's scale!âMan may intendâ That is his freedom, that his powerâno more!â Nor, from creation, hath the bustling world E'er sway'd Eternal Wisdom from his line, An atom's deviation. Soph. If the end, Must be, as it must be; what boots it, then, To swerve from excellence? Cal. Only to earn The guilt, but not the issue of our purpose. For will or nill, the same effect subscribes The over-ruling dictate. Fear not, then, What the spectator man may strive to warp Amid the works of HeavenâGo thou straight on; And do, as honour bids. Soph. 'Tis right, 'tis great, 'Tis glorious!âand my wish, so prompt of late, Shrinks back ashamed, nor dares abide the beam Of such illumination. Haste, my Caled, Our word hath past: our children let us leave To Heavenâlet's haste, my friend, let's fly to save, To rescue their destroyer. Cal. I go, my lord. Soph. Soft, Caledâfirst a wordâ SCENE V. As Sopheian and Caled confer, Zaphna enters at a distance. Zaph. He's thereâthe accurs'd of Heaven and of his Prophet!â The trampler of our law, the victim due!â Come, ye associates of the close assassin, Dissimulation, smooth-faced cruelty, And lurking treason!âaid my pious purposeâ That I may smile and talk, and smile and stab, For Heaven, and for the word!â [Exit Caled. Soph. Zaphna, welcome! O doubly welcome now; for I began To fear for thee, my son! Zaph. For me, my lord? Soph. Yesâthe unruly mob are ripe for mischief; And, in their fury, bent to massacre Your Prophet and his train. Zaph. A tale worth listening. [Aside. Soph. But, thanks to Heaven! thou art return'd in safety. My childrenâdo they live? Zaph. They do. Soph. Alas! I see thy plea hath been but half a winner: But my Palmyra kindly hath engaged To urge the dear petition to her father, With all her winning rhetoricâThou, my Zaphna, Stir not to tempt the danger of the hour; Already have I sent, and now I go To quell this tumult. Zaph. Whereforeâwhy, my lord, Wherefore to quell? does not your soul desire Perdition to our Prophet? Soph. Front to front, Or in the field, where open honour leads, Yes, to the death I'd cope himâbut not sap By mineing treachery. Zaph. O Heaven!âBut thinkâ Check fortune now, and what may follow?âha! Do you not hate, do you not fear him? Soph. Noâ My towering faith informs, that guilt alone Is real evilâWhat can man do, more Than Heaven gives scope? in that my trust is pillar'd. I fear him not, therefore I cannot hate himâ The armed hand may stroak the cockatrice, Admire her speckled crest, and pearled scale, When fearless of her sting. Zaph. That strikes a lightâ But O, from me how distant!âjust of force To dazzle, not to warm me. [Aside. Soph. I must hence. 'Till my return, this roof is thy asylumâ Would it were ever so! [Going. Zaph. Indeed, my lord!â And do you wish my safety?â'tis too muchâ Soph. Ah, Zaphna, how unkind that question!âYes, Thou generous youth, would I might ever hold thee, By all the twining bonds of dear affection! Those children that thy Prophet would impose, PerhapsâI know not whomâa foreign offspringâ O Heavens, that I might win thee but from thisâ I will not do thy ear offence, my son, To name him by his meritsâwhy that sigh?â That thou, I say, and thy Palmyra, here, Might reign with me in Mecca; share between ye My heart, my wealth, my scepter!âWhat, in tears! Zaph. Oh, pardonâ Soph. Nay, I must prevent thy knee; It is not in thy noble nature, Zaphna, To want a pardonâbut that I do love thee, Let this, and this, be witness!âFare thee wellâ [Embraces. May grace and honour guard thee! [Exit. Zaph. Guard me?â That was his gentle prayerâO no, my father! Fiends catch me first, and may the Heavens guard thee From traitors such as Zaphna!âSaid I, Heaven? Heaven! what is Heaven?âa prompter to ingratitude? To breach of faith, close couching treacheries, And murders?âZaphna then will none of Heavenâ He'll to the infernals first, the place opposed To such a Heaven, and dwell condemn'd to virtue. SCENE VI. Enter Caab cautiously. Caab. Zaphna!âmy lord, my lord Zaphna! Zaph. Caab!âWhat dost thou here? Caab. O, my good lordâthe Prophetâ Zaph. Damn the Prophetâ Thee, and his other instruments of practice, The word he utters, and the heaven he worships! Caab. O the good angel!âZaphna!âMercy take us! Where have you caught this frenzy! Zaph. Out, thou slave! Thou under serpent, poisoning as thou goest By curs'd insinuation; leaving still Thy venom in the track. Caab. What this will cost! When you shall knowâwhat grief, what penitence Zaph. I care notâI renounce thy sectâthy master, And thee thou image of his dross; his vile, His worst impression. Caab. What hath chanced? I hopeâ I hope you have notâI am sent dispatch, To intercept the strokeâand bring you to him. Zaph. To intercept it, say you? Caab. Yea, my lordâ Sopheian hath sent terms of due submission, Of suit and humble prayer to be received To grace and to the law. Zaph. Sayst thou, of suit?â And termsâwhat terms, good Caab? Caab. Nay, I know notâ Zaph. Pardon a young man's rashnessâSay, my friendâ Caab. In sooth, 'tis but surmise. Zaph. Of what? unfoldâ Caab. It were not well. Zaph. Kind Caabâ Caab. Have you e'er Remark'd a sort of kindness in Sopheian, Touching our sultan's daughter? Zaph. Oftenâyesâ He doth confess as much. Caab. I only know, The man hath eyes, desires, and appetites; Whether the lady hath temptations too, That I know not. Zaph. Thou hast a further cause. Caab. No more in truth, than what my distant ear Caught of brief accents, when with Mahomet He held a private conference. Zaph. In private? Caab. Yes. Zaph. And what didst gather? Caab. There, my lord, Your pardonâ My soul's best worth could scarce abide the charge Of such a revelation. Zaph. He did shew, A face and port of such an open tendence, I could not strayâI thinkâ If he doth hold me fair, and play me deep; I will have such atonement of his treachery, Such merciless accountâ Caab. O, let not me, Be author of ill thoughtsâI may have err'd. Zaph. Where shall I turn?âIf I look up to Heaven, I am confounded from his attribute, Nor know the power I pray toâif on earth, Design, and craft, and covert policy, Lie ambush'd in the social face of friendship, And trip at confidence. Caab. Take patience to you. Zaph. Why was I born?âO, what is man?âa thing, Form'd for the sport of some facetious deity! A vessel fill'd with adverse elements, Wherein his chymist would experiment The wantonness of warfare.âIn his infancy, The bud how tender!âshould he scape the frost, How short the blossom!âbring him to the fruit, He ripens into rottenness!âAway With such an insignificanceâan edifice, Built for the blast, a voyage but for the wreckâ A voyage? noâthat hath its chart, its compass, A star whereby to steer, and haply may Attain some havenâman is but a skiff, Toss'd out to chance; his boasted pilot, reason, A sluggard set to argue, not to act Against the tempest of contending passions. Now here, now there, he's thrown; nor knows a steerageâ No ground to anchor, and no skill to guide; The driving butt of every wind and tide! [Exeunt. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Mahomet's Pavillion. To Mahomet enter Palmyra. Maho. Palmyra here!âCome to my arms, my daughter. Pal. If I must lose your loveâyour blessing, sir, Is yet a boon, which sure I have not forfeited By any lapse of duty. [Kneels. Maho. Loved and bless'd, Thou art thyself the blessing of the Prophet; More loved, than ever father loved a child. [Embraces. Pal. You did refuse to ransom meâpreferr'd A foreign issue to your own Palmyra; Although to poise the lightness of my worth, The tender father added, in exchange, The purchase of a realm. Maho. He is a villainâ Sopheian is a dog! Pal. I know not thatâ He has proved a gentle parent to your daughter; The best of parents! Maho. How? Pal. O, pardon, sir! If I have err'd, my guilt will stand reproved In your excess of goodness. I am come An earnest suitor to you. Maho. Say, fair pleader. Pal. That of your bounty you would straight remit Those children to their sire, with all due circumstance, That may approve their birth. Maho. An hour shall send My latest answer. Pal. Let it be a kind oneâ Maho. Trust me, he shan't repine. Pal. Thus let me thank you. [Bends her knee. And shall I bear him back this kind assurance? Maho. Not so, my childâyou stay with us. Pal. Alas!â My lord forgets his daughter is a captive. Maho. I here strike off all chains, save of my loveâ And that's a dear retention. Pal. But, my lord, Can you strike off the chains of honour too, That bind me to return? Maho. I can, Palmyra; Nor may the chance of battle give Sopheian A right, superior to what nature gave To me thy parent. Pal. Such Sopheian's plea For his own children. Maho. He's an infidel, A wretch anathemized! Compact and faith With such a one, is impious. Pal. Ah, my father! If Heaven's best worshippers make light of faith, Is it with sinners we should hope to find The sacred obligation? Maho. Ha!âno moreâ Hast thou cast off respect and fair obedienceâ All duty? Pal. Whom, my lord, shall I obeyâ My first, or latter Prophet? You once told me, That truth, faith, virtue, honour, were immutable, Eternal in their natures: if you now Would change that system, when may I expect Another variation, and so onward, 'Till I am lost to all? Maho. Confound the lectureâ [Aside. I grieve, my child, that weighty avocations Intrude upon our converseâDo thy pleasureâ I did but trifleâ [Exit Mahomet. SCENE II. To Palmyra, enter Zaphna. Zaph. Here! Art thou here, Palmyra?âO my charmerâ Thy presence comes on my benighted soul, Like a glad morning, to dispel the horrors, Wherewith I stood beset!âBut say, my loveâ Hast thou considered, in Sopheian's conduct, Aught of uncommon tendernessâbeyond What thy superior worth might claim from friendship, Tho' that is much? Pal. Yes, Zaphnaâyet, no more Than my own heart did warrant me to answer; Tho' that was likewise much. Zaph. Of secret glance, Complexion hurried, incoherent speech; Sudden emotions half suppress'd, revealing What they do seek to hide? Pal. NoâneverâYes, Something of thisâyet little that I mark'dâ Sure nothing that could speak to thy suspicionsâ Why wouldst thou put me to ill thoughts, my Zaphna? Zaph. Didst thou hear aught touching a secret embassy, Sent by Sopheian to the Prophet? Pal. When? Zaph. Within this hour. Pal. Indeed!âno, nothing of it. Zaph. Nor aught of terms intended? Pal. Not a syllableâ What terms? Zaph. Suppose his faith, his crown, his people, offer'd For one rich jewel that out-prizes all. Pal. What jewel, Zaphna? Zaph. Even thyself, my love! Pal. It cannot be. Zaph. But if it shouldâhow then?â Shall I notâ Pal. What? Zaph. Transfix the traitor's heart? Pal. Alas! Zaph. Stab, tear the robber of my peace? Pal. Ah, Zaphna! My thoughts are driven amid a thousand terrors. Zaph. Peace to thy breast, my sweet!â'tis but conjecture. I have a hasty summons from thy father, And must attendâ Pal. O think, till thy return, No joy can enter where Palmyra sojourns. Zaph. Thy Zaphna's life shall wholly be employed, To trade for comforts, and unlade the freight Still where his soul hath anchor. Pal. Fare thee wellâ My ever loved, my friend, my father nowâ Farewell, my only Zaphna! [Exit Palmyra. SCENE III. To Zaphna Hercides. Hercid. Soft, Zaphna!âI must cross thy hasteâ Zaph. What's toward? Hercid. That I would ask of theeâI do adjure thee, By all my watchful cares, which, from thy infancy, Have been matured into a father's fondness, I do adjure thee, tell meâ Zaph. What, Hercides? Hercid. Why hath an hour thus robb'd thee of thyself? Honour, late blown, and open in thy aspect, Shrinks like a famish'd wretch; while, from the light, Thine eye turns inward, cleaving to the gloom, That broods upon thy soul. Zaph. Ohâ Hercid. Speak, my heroâ My son, my precious Zaphna! Zaph. Thou'lt be secretâ Hercid. Close as the tomb, the marble seal of silence.â Zaph. The Prophet thusâSopheian hath blasphemed Heaven and the lawâ Hercid. Proceed. Zaph. And Heaven hath doom'd His fall, dreadful, and suddenâ Hercid. Ha! by what means? Zaph. Even of this hand, Hercides. Hercid. Merey, mercy! O the eternal powers!âdid Mahomet Enjoinâwhat, Mahometâthine arm for this?â Most horrid! Zaph. Yesâthou seem'st amazed! Hercid. Bewareâ He comesâbe silentâO beware, my Zaphna! [Exit Hercides. SCENE IV. To Zaphna enter Mahomet. Maho. Zaphna, attendâand hear the leaf of Heaven Denounced on thy rebellious head, outcast From grace, and from the law! Zaph. What means my lord? Maho. My spirit went alongâI did behold thee Pale, trembling, weak, unworthy of the arm Elected from above. Zaph. O, had you seen My pangs and struggles tooâto pierce this heart, Had been repose to what I felt! And then, He spoke and look'd such things, such melting goodness! It seem'd as Heaven did not enjoin, but were Itself to feel the stab. Maho. 'Tis therefore, Zaphna, The thunder-stone just launching to o'erwhelm thee, Hath slumber'd in the hand. For O, already Thou art enough undoneâThis night was doom'd To love and to Palmyra. Zaph. To Palmyra? Maho. This night to loveâthe morrow was ordain'd To glory and to empire. Zaph. O, my lord, [Kneels. Is there no place for pardon? Maho. Zaphna, Zaphna!â To think but what a flood-gate Heaven prepared, To pour his blessings on thee! Zaph. O, my master! But for one trialâfor one hour's repealâ I go, I run, I fly to execute The thunder of thy word. Maho. Rise, riseâmy prayer Hath pull'd thy pardon downâThe time was notâ Thy arm was check'dâThe reprobate must fall, Spite of his late address and feign'd submission, Even at the altar of his godsâthose idols, In whose polluted and accursed name, He did blaspheme our Heaven! Zaph. It shall be done. Maho. Enoughâthat street directs thee to the Caaba. In the next hour he praysâ Zaph. He dies! Enter Caab. Maho. Well, Caab, Hast thou prepared our banquet? Caab. All is ready. Maho. Bid Omar, Abubeker, Abdoramen, And old Hercides, to the feastâBe speedyâ [Exit Caab. Zaphna, be firm! Zaph. O, doubt it not, my lord. Maho. Remember, that the Power who giveth life, With equal right may institute the means Of death to all men. Zaph. It is just! Maho. And yet, Thou dost not seem to relishâ Zaph. True, great Prophet! I had rather slay a host of men in battle, Than one within his wardâBut what were merit, If duty did not sway o'er inclination? Maho. Did not great Brutus bend in salutation, When, for his dearer country, he did stab The dearest of his friends?âTo serve her nation, Heber's renowned wife betray'd the faith She gave to flying Sisera; and, through The temples of her sleeping guest, enforced The inhospitable nailâAnd shall they act, Beyond what Heaven's appointed champion may, Arm'd by divine injunction? Zaph. Do not fear it.â SCENE V. To them enter Omar, Abubeker, Abdoramen, Hercides, Caab. The Scene opens and discovers a table with a bowl and chalice. Maho. Health to our friends, associates of the faith, Chief captains of the host of Heaven, elect To spread his laws on earth! Sit, sit, my brothers. Hercid. Ha! that chalice thereâI do not like its sanctityâ I knew a wretch once honour'd with that cup, Whose following banquet was in HeavenâI fear, I fear me, Zaphna, thou art not intended To be a frequent guest. [Aside, while the rest take their places: they all sit. Maho. Now to consult, how nations, yet unconquer'd, May soonest be subjectedâthere's our bent; First to subdue, and then reform; the purpose That consecrates our sword!âto this high mission Let's drink a social pledgeâZaphna, my son, Take thou the cup of honourânor conceive That those of riper years, but greener zeal, Envy thy proud appointment!âHere, my friends, To Zaphna the young leader of our arms, Health, glory, and successâHa! Traitorsâwhat! Which of you?âWhere's the wretch?â [Takes the bowl, and Zaphna the cup: as they both lift them to their lips, Mahomet starts up suddenly, and lets the bowl spill, while Hercides dashes the cup out of Zaphna's hands. All the company rise in amazement. Omar. What means our Sultan? Maho. As I held up the goblet to my lips, Some slave among you took his poniard forth, And struck it to my heart. Caab. The Heavens defendâ There is no poniard here. Maho. A sudden phantasie!â Some short indisposition!âBreak we upâ We shall soon meetâMy friends, farewell to allâ Zaphna, you know your province!âThis way, Caab. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Hercides advances, and the scene shuts. Hercid. O fool, O villain that I amâcurs'd caitiffâ A witless villain!âmight I not have found him? Heaven can't be with himâno, 'tis gross to sense! That I could be so deep a moleâso hoodwinktâ Muffled to be bemired in guiltâO this Entangling fiend, this ambient arch impostor! My master, my dear master first betray'd, His treasures plunder'd, and his smiling babes Rent from his bosom!âthisâYet what is this, To what ensues?âMercy!âI overheard themâ The young and noble son wrought by yon tempter To massacre a fatherâhis reward, The incestuous knowledge of a sisterâHeaven! Wer't thou but open to the eve of penitence!â How'ere, it is enoughâthe present burden. I'll to SopheianâI'll confess, unfold The freight of my offencesâfurther guilt Can only serve to sink a lower hell, And deepen my damnation!â [Exit. SCENE VII. The Caaba. Enter Mahomet and Caab. Maho. Caab, my cloakâhenceforth it is thine ownâ An honourable badge of our affection! Thy observation's just; there's no sure footing On the loose warrant of this giddy boy. Caab. No true dependence. Maho. Did he gorge our posset? Caab. I saw it in his lips. Maho. 'Tis wellâthere's one providedâand for t'other, Rather than fail, myself will be the surety Of his eternal restâDo thou and Omar Keep near, and wait the issue. Caab. Yet, be cautiousâ Maho. Fear notâAway. [Exit Caab. Sopheian once removed, The force of the remaining world can't lift Another bar like him to my ambitionâ What's this I feelâthis new intruder here? Who cries, Forbear!âand would erect himself Against our great supremacy of reason? I'll none of thee, thou meddling counsellor! AwayâThis is the hourâ Behind yon altarâthere I may retire, And watch the prompt occasion. [Goes behind the altar. SCENE VIII. Enter Sopheian. Soph. Adieu ye idols of my daily worship, False objects of true incense, cordial prayerâ Alas, how ill directed!âNever more Shall your waste altar from Sopheian's hand Receive the warm oblation. Enter Hercides on the opposite side. What art thou? Hercid. A villainâwhom the Heavens, to save Sopheian, Have turn'd to quick contritionâknow you not Hercides? Soph. How!âHercides? Hercid. Soft, my masterâ This way, for mercy's sake!âI must be shortâ Perdition is about usâHaste, O haste! [Exeunt. SCENE IX. Enter Zaphna, looking about. Zaph. He must be hereâI held him in mine eyeâ Yes,âin his sanctum yonderâAh, poor victim! What can thy prayers or faithless gods avail, When such a foe hath enter'd?âHow is this?â Although religion, love, and empire, urge me, Though heaven and earth call out and bid me strikeâ I have no stomach to'tâI have been told, That o'er the instant of some horrid act, Voices not human have been heard to scream Their nightly omensâspectred visages Glared on the eyeâand sudden lakes of blood Have risen athwart the process!â What a deep gloom dwells here to help devotion, To awe the spirits down, and give the blood Its reverential thrill!âMy soul is caughtâ Or is it cowardice that would unthread These sinews from their bent?âIt must be done. O, never holy priest, when on the altar He laid the lamb, that turn'd a piteous eye, Look'd gently up, and bleated for compassion, E'er struck with like reluctanceâYet it mustâ No more of torturing doubts, of dread suspensionâ What must be doneâonce doneâand all is finish'd! [Goes in behind the altar, and after some time returns. What should I think?â He did prevent my merit of its meaning; And made, what Heaven appointed for a murder, Mere self-defenceâHe aim'd his poniard wellâ But from his hand I wrench'd the levell'd steel, Struck the blow home, and cast him on the pavement. SCENE X. Enter Hercides. Hercid. Zaphna, beware!âI must be suddenâ If thou shouldst meet Sopheian, touch him notâ He is thy father! Zaph. Ha!â Hercid. Thy father, Zaphnaâ Thine and Palmyra's father! The impostor Did know it, when he urged thee to the parricideâ Ye are the twain, of whom, when in your infancy, He robb'd your gracious sire, the prince of Mecca; Himself the prince of devils! Hie thee henceâ Adieuâwe must not be observ'd together. [Exit Hercides. Zaph. How the earth shakes!âwhat sudden night comes on! Where am I?âon the brink!âthe flames beneath Shew where to plungeâCatch me, ye circling fiends! Wrap me with fiery scorpions! torture, tear The hell-taught parricide!â Is he among you? find him, search him outâ No Prophet here!âCome hellâcome thou alongâ And we will sweep him into such perdition, That our's shall be Heaven, from whence to look On his deep hell beneath! [Exit Zaphna. SCENE XI. Enter on one side Caab, on the other Omar. Caab. Saw you the Prophet, Omar? Omar. Noânot a creature pass'd, where I kept watch. Caab. I saw Sopheian, and young Zaphna enter, But not a soul return. Omar. Hear you that groan? Caab. I think the Prophet's voice. SCENE XII. To them enter Mahomet, feebly leaning on the altar, with a dagger in his breast; they run to him, and support him on each side. Omar. Alas, our sultan! Caab. Ah, my royal master! Maho. GentlyâO gently, friends!â I totter on the steepy ridge of life, And the least shove precipitates my being Down, down, the deep immenseâTo say, to say, When, where, and what's before meâ'tis a language New, wond'rous, horrible!âto human ears Impossible to utterâ Time's but a hinge, whereon mortality, A narrow portal, turnsâbehind, before, Lies the wide main of being!âO, I launchâ Support meâbut a moment moreâone momentâ 'Tis all my universe!âFor mercy, Ohâ Down reaching through the infinite abyss, To catch, to catch me, e'er I fallâOhâ [Dies. Omar. Soâthen our prophecying farce is overâ Caab. Omar, not soâour Prophet cannot dieâ Say he's retiredâin visionâor in tranceâ Any invention that may serve to prop Our new erected empireâLet us shade His great remains; with utmost privacy Convey him hence; and swear to hold this accident A secret from the world.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Sopheian and Caled meet. Soph. Joy, Caled, joy! they're known, they're known, my Caledâ O such a pair! Cal. Whom? Soph. Brave Moawias, And my fair Ayetiaâ My Zaphna and Palmyra! Cal. O grace! what of them? Soph. Even my little ones. Cal. Say you? Soph. The sameâthe news hath made me strong As in my prime of MayâO haste to find themâ The dear young traitors have escaped their bounds, And roam at largeâI to the Caaba, Toward Mahomet's pavilion thouâ O haste, haste my kind friend!â [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. Enter Palmyra. Pal. What may this bode?âI am undoneâbetray'd!â Thrice did I meet him; thrice, with courteous action, Woo'd him to conference; and thrice he started, As tho' his eye had caught, within its glance, A sudden basiliskâso struck with horror, He from my presence shrunk, and vanish'dâHaply, Some mood of his new jealousyâThere, Lo where he comes again!âsunk deep in thought, Some grievous thoughtâwithin himself shut up, And wrapt from every objectâStay I would not, To give him more offenceâfirst break my heart, Wanting his healthful presence! [Retires. SCENE III. As Palmyra retires slowly, and looks back, Zaphna, enters. Zaph. Upon the rack, stretch'd to the utmost point, That time allots mortality!âNo respiteâ A long, whole life of anguish!â'tis too muchâ Thought will not bear it; and the fact commands Dismission from aboveâProphet accurs'd!â But well the conscious fiend avoids this arm, Train'd by himself to murderâWretched Zaphna, From what a height, to what a depth of guilt, Hath the swift current of one headlong hour Hurried thee past repealâfrom parricide, To incest!â'twas the priceâmy sister's bed, Bought with my father's blood!âwhich unenjoy'd, I lose my purchase, and damnation comes Shorn of its profitsâSoftâforget her!âthatâ To plunge at once the deep Lethean gulph, A thousand fathom from the sense of thingsâ A mercy, next to bliss!âHa, there again!â Heaven would not, to the very teeth of guilt, Impel temptation thus; But that the fates, as though already past, Have laid the deed to comeâPalmyra! [While Palmyra advances slowly, and with diffidence, Zaphna speaks. Pal. My Zaphna! Zaph. O, Palmyra!â Pal. What would my love? Zaph. Didst thou hear aught? Pal. Of what? Zaph. Of something strangeâ Pal. No. Zaph. Of yawning earthquakes, and of deserts waste; Of tempest-beaten gulphs, whose opening womb Hath swallow'd all, nor left one mark behind For fortune's future stroke. Pal. These are sad wordsâ Pity for whom they point at! Zaph. Wheresoe'er, Heaven shield thy peace! for from this spot, Palmyra, We part, to meet no moreâ Pal. Save me, ye powers!â Ah, Zaphna, wild are all thy wordsâthy looks, Unform'd as cloudsâand, as the rushing winds, Unknowing whence they rise, and why they sweep To desolation! Zaph. No, Palmyra!âfix'd As earth's foundations, are the words I utter, And sure as misery and death to mortals! Pal. Yet sure as misery attends on man, We must not part, my Zaphna!âwhere thou goest, Thither will I; the ground that bears thy couch, Shall be a watchful pillow for my head; Thy joys shall be my joys, thy griefs my torture: In death conjoin'd with what of thee is mortal, There will I make my grave; and with thy spirit, Whate'er the lot, demand my Heaven hereafter. Zaph. Why, of what kin art thou to me? Pal. Is love, That sooths the warring elements, and tunes The world to order, of no kindred then? And am I not beloved? Zaph. Too well, too well!â Pal. Ah, tell me not. Man knows not how to loveâ And but the blush of maidenhood forbids The fond unfolding, I could tell thee, Zaphnaâ That where thy sex adventures but a step, We go a league in love, and I the farthest. Zaph. What wouldst thou do?âha! wouldst thou dareâ Pal. Yesâ Zaph. Fearlessly? Pal. Without a limitation. Zaph. Fit those limbs for travel? Pal. Yesâwith thee. Zaph. Whatâto the brink? Pal. And onwardâ Zaph. O ye powers? Thinkâto forego dominion, pomp, all quality And softness of thy sex! Pal. Slight obstaclesâ Zaph. O'er-journey'd then, or toil'd with such rude tasks As penury enjoinsâto lay thee down On the cold healthless ground; the welkin wide And dark, thy drizzly curtainâ Pal. Hard, indeedâ If thou the sharer, Zaphna! Zaph. Hunger-clinch'd, Or scant of such rude viands as do strive With appetiteâ Pal. Yet, cherish'd at thy side, This were a festival. Zaph. Resolved! determin'd!â Thy hand thenâcome, at onceâwhy dost thou linger? E're this we should be wing'd upon the way, To leave reflection and remorse far off, The laggards of our journey. Pal. But Zaphnaâ Zaph. O triflerâfare thee wellâ Pal. I willâCome onâ Who lingers now? Awayâbut thou art so rash, So full of starts, that sally up to frenzyâ 'Tis this that frights me. Zaph. Take me to thee then, And mould me as thou wilt. Pal. Yesâwitness Heaven! In lieu of all, I take theeâhence, and ever, [Embrace. My lord, my husband, father, brother! Zaph. Ha! Off, hold thee offâPerdition on the name! Pal. The matterâwhatâwhy Zaphnaâon my knee, Wherein have I offended? Zaph. Who inform'd thee? Pal. Of what, my life? Zaph. Thy life!âO angel innocenceâ Thy death, thy deep damnation!âNay, hold off, Nor touch pollutionâVillain that I am, Thy honour's grave, the gulph that would devour The worth of thine eternal soulâThy brother?â I amâindeedâthy brother!â Pal. Shield me, Heaven! Zaph. Saidst thou not, father too?âAlas, Palmyra! Thou hast no fatherâ [Weeps. Pal. What's befallen? Zaph. Just butcher'dâ Even by these hangman's hands. Pal. My father?â Zaph. Murder'dâ Pal. It is too muchâO Zaphna, cruel Zaphna!â Zaph. The good, the kind old manâthe sacred source, That lent us both a beingâstopt for ever!â The generous, great Sopheian! Pal. Ah, my Zaphna, Thy health is shaken much, o'ersway'd by crossesâ I too have caught the maladyâmy brain Begins to turn. Zaph. Omnipotent! whose pardon over guilt Reaches a length immense, be near me nowâ O save me from that presence!âDown, Palmyra, Low as the earth, before the sacred shade [Kneel. Of thy great sireâ'Tis justâI feel his vengeance, Forerunning his approachâit bears upon meâ It whelms, it crushes me!â SCENE IV. Enter Sopheian in haste, He runs and embraces them. Soph. They're hereâThey're foundâ O let me fold them, let me wrap them inward; Return them to the womb of yearning love, The heart's warm seat of life! there feed my young ones, And cloath them with my vitalsâMy Palmyraâ My Zaphnaâmy Palmyraâmy long lostâ O children twice conceivedâthe happier birth, To greet my yearsânew infants of my ageâ I have it not in wordsâ'tis hereâ'tis hereâ The welcome of my babes!âKneel ye, my children? Now all the blessings of the dews that fall In our Arabia, all the sweets that rise, Be in you, and about you, till your virtues Grow as in paradise, matured to Heaven, Without a blossom droptâThese arms are aged, In fondness overstrain'dâNay, rise, pray rise, And bless me alsoâ Zaph. That which is not to be, and that which is, Struck from the rank of things!â It mustâyet cannotâ These are the very megrims of existence; The dizzy rounds of thought, that foundering drown In their own whirlpools. Soph. How, my son!âWhy Zaphnaâ Zaph. Nayâby your pardon, sirâI will dispute it Against all tricks of sophistryâTo say That things without, are not within usâlo, Those racks, those wheelsâthere's no such thingâ'tis here!â 'Tis the mind's bed whereon the body lies, Stretch'd out in anguish! Soph. I am lost to this. Zaph. But have you heard the like? Soph. Of what, my child? Zaph. Perhaps a fableâClytemnestra too Was but a mother, and the story says A bad oneâin his father's quarrel too He struckâO wretched son!âand he ran mad for'tâ I have not read of any son so lost, As to assault a fatherâif you have, I'll listâand weep the while. Soph. Alas! Palmyra. Pal. My lord. Soph. Dost thou know aught of this? Pal. In truth, I am myself beside the sense of things. You say, you are my fatherâPardon, sir; Your goodness makes you such to every orphanâ But, if I claim you by a nearer title, Then who is Mahomet? Soph. A murderous faulcon! Who seizing on the nest of my delights, Bore off the mother with her little ones, And left me reft indeedâHow fares my Zaphna?â His eye is much distemper'd. Zaph. Within the map of our mortality, Is it not to be foundâthe land of sleep?â Or if a stranger, and in foreign climes, I have dream'd thusâwould it were morning!âOâ My headâlight, lightâthy arm, sweet sister. Soph. His healthâkind Heaven, be it thy care!âMy daughter, Lead him to some reposeâ SCENE V. Zaphna goes out led by Palmyra. Hercides enters hastily to Sopheian. Hercid. Beware, my lord, the surety of your person! The moon doth wax in labour; all abroad Is bustle, all confusion; throughout Mecca, Each house is left the watch of its own fires, And the wide air is peopled.â Soph. What is forward? Hercid. Some cry, The Prophet, where's the Prophet? Each Inquires th'alarm, none answersâthis way now, And that again, the tide of concourse flows, Unknowing why. To Mahomet's pavilion I flew; affright and busie consternation Was visaged in his train. I press'd to enter; When Abdoramen barr'd me with his hand, And to my earââThe Prophet is intrancedâ âTo Heaven, perhaps, upon a second embassyââ He murmur'd and retiredâIs Zaphna safe? Soph. Here, in my palace. Hercid. From what perils scapedâ Amazing providence! Soph. But much displaced, By constitution, or ill rest; and somewhat Tending unto deliriumâhe did talk Of actions dire, dark treasons, and of parents By savage children slainâ Hercid. Ha! pause awhileâ It did occurâI have itâOn my soul The impostor is no more!âI do remind meâ Slain by mistakeâas mercy shall o'ertake me, Fallen in the toils he pitch'd!â Soph. Who, Mahomet? Hercid. Even soâI do remind meâEvery noon, Was't not your use to worship at the Caaba? Soph. It wasâ Hercid. There was your hour of slaughter fix'dâbut then This Prophet for the fiends, being ill-assured Of his young votary, not vers'd in blood; In person hath adventured, and so fell Even by his own appointment. Soph. I do think, It bears a face. Hercid. Upon my life, a sure one! When in the temple I did warn your son To spare a father, I do mind the horror, The wild astonishment his eye did utterâ As though the deed had overrun prevention, And caution came a laggard. SCENE VI. Enter Caled. Cal. Health to the prince of Mecca! may his reign, Peaceful and late, know every night like this, Without a rival!âMahomet, 'tis thought, Is fallenâfor certain, fled. His votaries, As people all appall'd, converse in murmurs; And sudden rumour thins his host. Soph. O friendâ Come to my breast, and share its exultation. [Embrace. 'Tis else too mighty; this concurring floodâ Peace, and my children too!â Cal. Whatâfound? restored? The same, and both? Soph. How kind this social transport!â Yes, Caled, both, the long lost little ones, The individual pairâHercides here Confirms the wondrous blessing. Cal. HaâHercides!â Softâlet me view him wellâI would not rashlyâ The blood of innocence, 'tis dear aboveâ The same, by all my hopes.âVillain accurs'd! [Seizes him, and draws a poniard. Be shortâif that thou own'st a prayerâif Heaven May list to sudden penitenceâthis instantâ 'Tis all the wealth thou hast, wherewith to quit Thy manifold incumbrance. Soph. Friend!âHercides!â What may this mean? Cal. Away, Sopheianâ He dies on thy approach! SCENE VII. Enter Zaphna and Palmyra. Zaph. My gracious lord, if malady may plead [To Sopheian. For errors not of willâ [Hercides kneels. Hercid. Ah, Zaphnaâwill you, Will you behold the fosterer of your youth Butcher'd by sudden hands?âyour fond preserverâ The breast whereon your infancy was laid, Rent in your presence? Zaph. Who avows a deed So horrid? [Lays his hand to his sword. Sopheian prevents him. Cal. Off, rash boy!âthou mayst avenge, Not save himâwho advances, by my life But quickens his perdition!âPatience, friends, You know him notâthis caitiffâCome, to shriftâ It boots thee not to hesitateâdispatch Thy villainies at large! Hercid. Oh, Heaven already Hath heard the deep detailâ Cal. Know'st thou this princeâ Hercid. My first, and worthiest master. Cal. Had a brother? Hercid. Ay, sir, the noble Josephâyou do press me, Even to the quickening of my crimes. Cal. O wretch, How didst thou find them natured to each other?â Of souls adverseâor twined in amity, As brothers should? Hercid. No loom of shuttled threads E'er wove so close a web. Cal. How grew their difference? Hercid. Shame would suppress the memoryâ'Twas then, When the profane impostor first commenced His dream of Heaven, into my secret soul He warp'd his gliding legendsâI did think, That evil was the blessed act of saints, When hallowed in the purpose. Cal. Hear you that, Zaphna? Zaph. I do hear it feelingly. Hercid. This my dread lord, and his all noble mate, This bond of brotherhood, this brace of pillars, On whom Arabia built her nest of odours, Was I instructed to divide. Soph. O Heavens! Hercid. To him I forged a tale of pregnant lust And treasons, working in the faithful breast Of his most loving brotherâwhile, to Joseph, I framed suspicions dark, and deeds of blood, Thro' envy stirr'd of his superior virtue. Thus the thrice valiant Joseph was o'ersway'd To flee the place of his respect and safety; And by the absence of his potent arm, Left the usurper free in his career To lust and to ambition. Cal. Fare thee wellâ The tale is toldâHeaven take thee to his mercy! Soph. Pernicious slaveâO treason to my peace! 'Tis lost for everâFool, most credulous fool, Fit stuff for knaves to work uponâO brother, Then thou art wrong'd, dear brother of my soul, Wrong'd past the reach of penitence!âHa, caitiff, This youth and maiden too? Hercid. My gracious lord, I do confess, to form them in the faith, Young proselytes for Heaven, I did assist To tear them from thy armsâyet, Heaven alike Will witness for me, that my love to both, Did pass a parent's fondnessâfrom their infancy, Oft in my arms, and never from my heart, I watch'd their ways, and warded all their dangers; Yea, to this day, when on the verge of death, From Zaphna's lip I dash'd the poison'd cup, Even in the tyrant's presence. Cal. Good, my lord! Such deeds as these, to nature's not impassable, Have a strong pleading. Pal. Might I find acceptance. Zaph. Let my knee speak. Soph. O ZaphnaâO my children!â You know not whomâit is a sum immense, That counts our losses; uncle, brother, father, All the dear ties!âthy precious father, Zaphna, Shorn by this slave. Zaph. O grace, O earth, O Heaven! Am I not then your son? Soph. Thou art indeed, Son of my soul, loved heir of my adoption; But he thy nobler, more exalted sire, By nature as by worth. Zaph. Your servant everâ Hear'st thou, Palmyra? Soph. 'Tis a tale, my children, Full of fond tears, and we will pay them amply. Pal. to Cal. If, sir, you deem me worthy of a claim In that dear kinsman; pardon my inquiryâ You seem no stranger to him. Cal. True, kind maid!â And yet to speak the wonders of his pilgrimage, His wrecks, his scapes, vicissitudes extreme, And feats in foreign climes atchieved, the burden Would charge a wakeful listenerâFoot by foot, Together have we trod the maze of fortune; And arm in arm, with frost upon our helms, Abode the tentless fieldâThe rest is mournfulâ Let his last charge sufficeââSince Heaven,â he said, âForbids these eyes the prospect of a brother, âMore long'd than lightâbe thine that blessing, Caled! âConvince him of his servant's faithâhis innocenceâ âBut no reproof, my friend!âAnd in thy sojourn, âIf thou shouldst meet with some unhappy orphan, âHeir to his sire's misfortunesâthen, my Caledâ âThink of my child, and take him to thy bounty!â Zaph. It is not to be bornâ Soph. Enough, enough!â This strikes at life. Caled. Alas, his visage turns!â I have gone too farâMy lord, my royal master, Pardon the fond deceit!âhe livesâyour servant, Your Joseph livesâill meriting such goodness. Soph. Sayst thou, great oracle? Caled. He stands before you. [Throws off his disguise; Sopheian, Zaphna, and Palmyra stand some time amazed: then Sopheian rushes to his arms, while Zaphna and Palmyra kneel beside them. Pal. Ahâ Zaph. Heavens!â Soph. The mighty powers of graceâI have him!â Offâ Let my eye make him sure, that every sense May seize its proper blissâ'Tis he, 'tis heâ Hear it, ye tribes of Ishmael!âLo, Arabia! Lo, thy returning PhÃ¦nixâO, my Joseph, No more of partingânever cross my ear, Croak such a raven moreâbut thus, still thus, [Embrace. Even in the sleep of death, together wedded, Till the last peal shall wake the world. Caled. These sobsâ These tears arrest my utteranceâlet them answer. Soph. Josephâbehold thy children!â Caled. O sweet maid!â [Embraces Palmyra. May Heaven enfold thee with a love like mine, And clasp thee to his graceâZaphna my child! [Embrace. Zaph. O, sirâ Caled. Why weeps my boy? Zaph. Unwonted feelings these, that wring the heart With such a straight embrace. Sons, brothers, sires, to me new comers all! Yet nature knows, and opens for their entrance; But answers to them with a voice so loud, It tears the mansion inward!âLate, your Zaphna Wanted a friendâand now, he has a father!â Soph. Joseph, thy compactâtake Palmyra to thee; And when thou wouldst prefer the maid in marriage, I claim her for my Zaphna. Zaph. Sirâto speakâ Soph. I see, thou canst not; thy too grateful heart Is overchargedâO Joseph, O my brother, Thus, like two confluent streams, in these our children, And theirs descending, we shall flow together, Smiling through time, and reach into eternity. Cal. Heaven, thou art mighty and confess'd in this! With what an arm, through what a mortal maze, Hast thou led forth thy servants?âRise, Hercides! Errors that meet reluctance in the will, Give place for reformationâStill be near, And let thy Zaphna find a father in thee. Pal. But what, alas, your censure of Palmyra, Whose life hath been one error? Zaph. This, my loveâ That from our present sense of previous slidings, We gather cautious steps, and upright treadingâ Zaphna hath taken a lesson from his faults, Beyond all rules of stern philosophyâ Untutor'd as I am, and new to learn, Where, or to whom, revealing Heaven hath sent His outward lumination, sure I am His inward is to all men. Is it reason? Noâ'tis the Bosom'd God, the Living Sense, That feels, not argues upon guilt or goodness. 'Tis our Internal Chymist, skill'd to try The bullion'd dross, or gold, of every faith, By the quick touch of his approved assay. If that All-actuating Power, who form'd, And fills mankind, hath stoop'd to their instruction; 'Tis to refine the principle he gives, And not to quell the native sense of goodness. In vain we would The Eternal Unit partâ One in the Heavens, and in the feeling heart! His laws to his impressions must be kin: Where GOD's without, he speaks the GOD within.</field>
