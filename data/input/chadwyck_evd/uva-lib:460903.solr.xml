      <field name="fulltext">Scene I. —The Exterior of Adina's Farm. A Bright Landscape, with Cornfield, &amp;c., in the distance. Adina's house R. (Gianetta, Catarina, Maria, and Village Girls discovered around Tomaso, who is in the act of retailing village scandal.) Tom She did indeed! Mar Oh, dear! how very dreadful! Gia Who of such nonsense could have crammed her head full? Cat Adina, too, who treats us all like dirt! Gia Oh, what a wicked, heartless little flirt! (with an air of regret) I am so sorry! it will grieve her pa so! (All shake their heads and sigh.) (with vivacity) Tell us some more, you dear old duck Tomaso! Tom Well, then, I hear—but p'raps it isn't true— Gia But what? (impatiently) Tom That you, and you, and you (indicating Gianetta, Catarina, and Maria)— (changing his mind) But, after all, I may malign the dear. All but Gia. Oh, do go on—we do so want to hear! Tom Well, then—but, no! All Oh, do! Tom Well, then, in fine, Although maligning isn't in my line, She said that you (whispering Gianetta). Gia (placing her hand on her back hair) How dare she! It's my own! Tom Said that its colour didn't match in tone; (Other girls chuckle aside.) Said that its life hung on a single spare pin, Which might come out—for accidents will hair-pin. Gia To take my style off pleases Addy, does it? (sneering) Tom She says you always take it off to fuzz it. (to Catarina) She says you (whispers)— Cat (indignantly) Oh, a pretty tale you're fetching! I never touch a paint—except for sketching. Tom She says you paint your face, to catch each duller he— Which she calls skitching, p'raps because it's colour-y. She says in painting you've such erudition, She may say you're a perfect Exhibition! Isn't it shocking? Gia Well, of all the spiteful— (Enter Adina, followed by Nemorino.) But here she comes (to Adina). You darling dear delightful— (Girls crowd round her.) We've come to see you, as it is your fête To-day, dear Addy, you're twenty-eight! Adi (with apparent regret) Oh no, alas! in error there you fall, (sighing) I'm but a paltry eighteen, dear, that's all! (gushing) How kind of you, your welcome so to frame, That I might share the dignity you claim! Gia That you are joking, Ady, I'll engage. You haven't raised my anger! Adi Nor your (r)age! (Gianetta looks spitefully at Adina. All take leave of her and go off L. Enter Nemorino R.) Nem Adina! Adi (impatiently) Well? Nem Adina, I am here To urge my suit upon its wild career— My undivided love on you I set, The very first occasion that we met— When through the poultry yard I saw you pickin' Your way as chicken-tender—tender-chicken! Scattering barley—and altho' 'twas plain That feeding chicks went quite “against the grain,” I envied e'en the fowls who comicahly Hopped round you like a feathery corps de barley: One of those Dorkings I would be, in one sense. Adi What! be a Dorking? Pooh, you're dorking nonsense! Nem I feel most madly jealous, Bella Venere, To see you daily going to your Hen-ery! (attempts to kiss her. She resists.) Oh, come, I think my love may take that scope, You'll be my dear rib very soon, I hope. Adi. Your dear rib? How can that be? As I bide Here in the Poultry, you must mean Cheap-side. It seems, sir, from this very rash confession, That on your heart I've made some slight impression. Nem. Impression! think you that my heart is flint? Of the impression, dear, a proof I'll print. (Attempts to kiss her—she resists.) Nay, twill not hurt you—do not stand aloof, I vow it shall not be an Injure proof (kisses her.) Adi. (angrily) Oh, gracious goodness, if we were detected! I'm sure that proof requires to be corrected, So please consider that I've done so. Nem. Yes— The next step, then will be to “go to press.” (squeezing her round the waist.) Resist not one who faithfully adores! Adi. Now, once for all, I never can be yours. Nem. Oh! if indifferent to you I be— Adi. No, you are not indifferent to me; For if you were describable as such I shouldn't like you or dislike you—much! Nem. Say, am I fast, or fond of running ticks; False, old, bald, ugly— Adi. Yes, you are—all six. Duet. Air—“Hot Corn.” Nem. Do, do, Pity me; you Willy me, nilly me, charm me so! Adi. Pooh, pooh, Coming to woo; Pity me—quit o' me—calm me so! Nem If you say nay, I can only say, Skid-a-ma-link and a doodah day, Boodle, oodley, umshebay, And a hunky dorum, doodle day— Both I say/You say, nay he/I can only say, Skid-a-ma-link and a doodah day, Ah! ah! ah! ah! Adi No, no, Toddle and go, Thingummy, sing o'me, now no more— Nem So, so, Pretty a beau! Sad o' me, mad o' me, vow no more— Adi If I say nay, he can only say, Skida-ma-link and a doodah day, Boodle, oodley, umshebay, And a hunky dorum, doodah day. Both If he/she, &amp;c. (Dance—Towards conclusion Adina dances towards wing, followed closely by Nemorino—she faces him, turns him to the right-about, and both dance off in opposite directions, Nemorino expressing despair.) (Drum heard. Enter Tomaso, meeting Gianetta.) Gia What are those sounds that strike upon me now? Tell me, Tomaso, what's the tow-row-row. Tom Gianetta, twenty soldiers, all in blue, With great Belcore marching with them too, Approach the village—and this way he comes, I hear their trumpets sounding (on my drums. (Enter Belcore's soldiers L. U. E., headed by drum-major and small drummer, and preceded by a troop of village boys and girls, singing.) Chorus of Villagers and Soldiers. Air—“Johnny comes marching home.” Belcore comes marching home again, Hurrah! Hurrah! He'll turn our village girls insane, Hurrah! Hurrah! On a soldier's coat all maidens doat, Those joyful shouts that fact denote, We'll all be gay! Belcore comes marching home! (Enter Belcore L. U. E.) Song.—Belcore. Air—“La tremenda ultrice spada” (Capuletti.) Bel For this welcome, unrivalled in story, Belcore's thanks are truly, truly due, I'll be civil, tho' sated with glory— How de do? How de do? How de do? (to Nemorino) Even you, sir! I ask you how you do, sir? I'll be civil, tho' sated with glory— How de do? How de do? How de do? (surveying the Villagers with exaggerated scorn.) Humph! happy villagers! I think I oughtn't To miss this chance of showing I'm import'nt. (ferociously to crowd) Ha ha! (all start) He he! ho ho!—once more ha ha! Also, Yah! Pshaw! Phew! Ugh! Pish! Tush! Pooh! Bah! (aside) The only interjection that I know, Except, “alas,” which don't my meaning show. (to crowd) Are you convinced, to treat me ill were folly? All We are! Bel You are? All right—then let's be jolly. (to Nemorino) Some wine! (he hesitates) my order don't you be gainsayin' it, I'll make you be obeyin' it—with a bayonet. (threatens him—Adina brings wine, R.) A stoup of wine, my pretty little friend! A stoup's the thing to make a man unbend. (Belcore drinks.) What cherry lips! This chance, who would be missing! (attempts to kiss her.) Adi (coyly) They're made for talking, sir, and not for kissing. Bel You mus'n't try my wishes, Miss, to baulk, (kisses her.) I like the cherry better than its talk! Sure, such a sergeant's fit to be your beau! Nem Such as are gents don't treat a lady so! Adi Allow me, sir, to disentangle, please. (removes his arm.) Bel But, tell me where I am, and who are these? Tom You're in a village during harvest time, Where all the humblest peasants talk in rhyme. And sing about their pleasures and their cares In parodies on all the well-known airs. They earn their bread by going in a crowd. To sing their humble sentiments aloud, In choruses of striking unanimity— (aside) The only rhyme I know to that, is dimity, They never wear umbrellas—so they get Their dress of watered silk—or else well wet. Their dresses of drawing rooms is emblematic Although their mode of life is upper-atic! Quintette and Chorus.—Nemorino, Gianetta, Adina, Tomaso, and Belcore. Air—“The Sugar Shop.” Adi If you intend to stay with us, before you've been a day with us, You'll learn the proper way with us, of saying what you say with us. Each speech should have a pun in it, with very foolish fun in it— And if you can't bring one in it, you'd better stop away. Gia Rule rule, of where you've been intruding to— Fool, fool, learning please begin, You'll, you'll learn to be alluding to The neighbourhood of Chancery Lane as “Skid a ma Lincoln's Inn.” Tom And when of punning speech, you know, the end you nearly reach you know, Experience will teach, you know, a comic song to screech, you know; And laughter to enhance, you know, each song must have a dance you know— A needful circumstance, you know, a dozen minutes long! Nem Rule, rule, enjoyment not diminishing, Fool, fool, booby, booby, boob; You'll, you'll learn each ballad finishing With a flip-up in the Skidamalink, and a flip in the juben-jube! Gia A soldier of his rank, you know, whose spurs and sabre clank, you know, Won't condescend to thank, you know, advice so very frank, you know— (aside) Of all eccentric villages on whose productive tillages He's made his martial pillages, this is the oddest, far! Bel Cease, cease, superfluous admonishing, Please, please, allow me, ma'am to say These, these syllables astonishing— (And please encore 'em) “Hunky-dorum doodle diddle cum day. Chorus—Cease, cease, &amp;c. (Comic dance, upon which Scene I closes.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene II. —Interior of Nemorino's Farm House. (Enter Nemorino, R.) Nem Nice men, these soldiers, for a quiet town! They've turned Adina's noddle upside down. She hardly speaks to me since here they came, And all the other girls are just the same. The fellows ogle in a shameful way, And stalk about the hamlet all the day With glass in eye, which they imagine swell is— Those eyes in glass make me extremely jellies. To make the thing as pleasant as can be, Sergeant Belcore's billeted on me! He shares my room and wardrobe, and I sup with him; I've only one room, so I must “put up” with him. When he gets up he uses, every day, My toothbrush in an aggravating way; My shirts and boots he looks on as his own, And snores all night like a worn-out trombone. This is a hamlet, as I've said before, But this is not the Castle of Els'nore. Well, I'll be even with him e'er I go, If irritating tricks can make me so. (Enter Belcore L.) I hope you're pretty comfortable. Bel Why, You will forgive my mentioning that I Don't care to feed on raw, unwholesome fruits— Don't often wear black-beetles in my boots— Against coal-scuttles hate to bark my shins— Don't care for sofas thickly stuffed with pins. “Apple-pie order” suits methodic heads, But I don't like it to extend to beds; Don't like for snoring to be nightly blown up, Don't like to find my coat-sleeves always sewn up. It isn't paid for, I'd have you be knowing! Nem. (aside) I call it stitching, and he says it's owing! Bel. My bed's as hard as wood whene'er I fill it— Well, you demanded, and you've got a—billet. Bel. My pillow's like a log against my crown! Nem. I'm so hard up, you can't expect soft down. Bel My breakfast done to rags—not fit for food. Nem What, over-boiled? Bel I see, I'm under-stewed. With stinging herbs my bed seems nightly settled. Nem You seem annoyed? Bel. (rubbing himself) Well, I'm a good deal nettled! With these exceptions—drawbacks, as you see— I am as comfortable as can be. (Enter Adina R. Nemorino runs to meet her.) Nem Adina! Adi (pettishly) Oh, I wish we'd never met; As Scotchmen say, “A-dinna, please, forget.” I love Belcore, and we mean to wed. Nem (aside) To-night I sprinkle cayenne in his bed— Red-Pepper's ghost shall haunt him—that be my end— The fellow cannot take it as un-cayenned! Adi The sergeant's good as gold—as people say— Nem I am as good as argent—any day! (to Adina) Once you approved my love—now, you reject it! Adi You've got no money—so you can't expect it. (aside to Belcore) Despair o'erwhelms the hard-up bosom, I know, Of Nemorino, at the name o'rhino. Bel (to Nemorino) She'd ne'er have loved you, if she had, before, Seen a Belcore head his able corps. Nem His sable corps—your meaning, sir, I track, A corps composed of guards, whose tint is black! Trio—(Adina, Belcore, Nemorino.) Air—“Harum-Scarum Galop.” Adi Marry me, carry me, off we go, my hand Belcore take! Bel I fear, my dear, this party here, objection has to make! Nem Agony! bragany more I can't, for utterly I'm put out! Bel I see that he, decidedlee, is done, without a doubt. Only say, you'll name the day, Delaying it were folly, O! Adi Of this we'll speak on this day week, And all will then be jolly, O! Nem I thought that she was fond of me, But now she loves this Pollio! Bel It pleases me, a wee to see, This party melancholly, O! Bel (to Nemorino) Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man, Get you gone as soon as you can. Adi (to Nemorino) Understand, you're in the way, So get you gone to Botany Bay. All Botany, Botany, Botany, Botany, Botany, Botany, Botany, Botany, Botany, Botany, Botany, Botany, Get you gone to Betany Bay Discarded Nemorino! (Together) Marry her/me carry her/me off you/me go—her/my hand, Belcore take, &amp;c. (Dance off R.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene III. —Village Market Place, with Fair going on. Grand Ballet of peasants, soldiers, and fisher girls. At the close of the Ballet all the persons on the stage move towards the entrance from which Dulcamara is to appear. Then Dr. Dulcamara appears (R.) in a magnificent chariot drawn by a donkey; on the donkey is seated Beppo. The chariot stops in the C. of Stage. Song—Dulcamara and Chorus. Air—“Hunkey Dorum.” Dul Dulcamara's come to town! Cho Dulcamara, doodlecum day! Dul Spend with him a single crown! Cho Dulcamara, doodlecum day! Dul Try his pills, and buy his Squills! Cho Dulcamara, doodlecum day! Dul No such ills as doctor's bills! Cho Dulcamara, doodlecum day! Dul If you should be melancholee, Or visions see, or feel ennui, Pray come to me, for I am he, Who makes you free for half a fee! Cho Dulcamara's come to town, &amp;c. Dul (through a speaking trumpet) Ta ran ta ra! Ta ran ta ra ra, ra ra! Here you behold the famous Dulcamara. This is my donkey—sent me from Aleppo— This is my other donkey—silly Beppo. (Throughout this scene Beppo affects the character of a drivelling idiot, except when soliloquizing.) His loss of wits don't make him eat a bit less, He eats his wittles, tho' the fellow's wit (tle) less. Although of learned titles I've a score, I'm Doctor Dulcamara—nothing more! No doser of his patients, here I show, I am no jalaping snob of Savile Row! I cure all maladies, in every station, By my new process—simple inhalation, (Producing an enormous pair of bellows.) Which means that I amass my patients' wealth By telling them that they're in ailing health! (to a peasant) Say, do you ever have to scratch your head? (peasant nods) You do? Consumption you are bound to dread! (to another) Say, do you ever yawn in church? (second peasant) I do. [Dul] Consumption, sir has tackled on to you! (to a third) You, when you run a mile, are out of breath? (peasant nods) Why, bless my soul, my man, that's certain death! (to a fourth) Say, can you punish bread and cheese and beer— Make fearful mounds of victuals disappear— Consume your dinner with voracious rage? (peasant nods vigorously) Consumption in its most destructive stage! (to another) Say, do you ever cough, or ever wheeze? Or ever whoop or hack, or ever sneeze? Or ever breathe with dreadful difficulty? (peasant) No! [Dul] Then one lung's gone—ere long the other'll go. But I dont stick to invalid society— I've books, toys, dolls in every variety. (Produces a model gun.) Here is a model gun, contrived last season— And made to “go off” cheap—and for this reason— The maker wasn't paid, that I'm aware— But after all, that's neider here not there! (Producing books.) Here are some poems, which in my chaise are pack't, They're rather—h'm—You understand? In fact (confidentially) I shall suppress them—which will prove their blessing— Tom I think I'll take one, since you are suppressing! (Villagers crowd to buy the books.) Dul (producing another book) Here's breathing liberty, in one long column, A treatise on Reform—by Green—one Wallum! (Producing picture of a policeman.) Want a policeman? it's a bob; not dear—(they shake their heads.) I thought you didn't, or he'd not be here. Song—Dulcamara and Chorus. Air—“Io son ricco.” Buy my goods, as I'm advising Buy for microscopic sum, (For its cheapness is surprising,) My Odontolagicum! Ev'ry shilling that you venture Half-a-guinea you may call— If you spend it on debenture, It will go for good and all. Chorus —Yes, we buy as you're advising, &amp;c. (During Chorus the peasants crowd round the Doctor and buy various articles of him, then the cart is taken away L., and the women gradually go off with the soldiers, leaving the male peasants, with Nemorino and Tomaso, alone with Dulcamara and Beppo, who drivels idiotically about the stage.) Nem (taking Dulcamara aside confidently, with the other male peasants) We want you to assist us in our plight— These soldiers have enslaved our sweethearts quite; The love that they've professed for many a day Seems to have faded from their hearts away: Like some cheap photo—taken for one's cara— In a dull camera, great Dulcamara. We want 'em back—can you perform the trick, sir? Dul Of course I can!—try my far-famed Elixir (producing bottles). Use it as these instructions here direct— No girl your love can possibly reject. One shilling and three-ha'pence—failing never! Nem (reading) It's Madame Rachel's “Beautiful for Ever!” But we must work all day on yonder plain, So, won't our faces soon turn brown again At any sun that's then the heavens crowning? Dul If you're at any sun you can't be browning! Duet—Nemorino, Dulcamara, and Chorus. Air—“Champagne Charley is my name.” Nem Our lovers all desert us for these military swells, And all alike they've gone on strike, these fickle village belles; We'll lay it on as thick as mud before we go to bed, And “beautiful for ever” in the morning be instead. For sham complexion is our aim, Sham complexion is our aim; We'll put it on the latest thing at night, boys; To-morrow we'll be fascinating quite, boys! All Sham complexion is their/our aim, &amp;c., Dul If you have any doubt about the truth of Doctor D. You've only got to cast your eye upon the face of me. A plainer man than I was once you very seldom see, But now I am as beautiful as you could wish to be. My sham complexion brings me fame, My sham complexion brings me fame; I lay it on the latest thing at night, boys— In the morning I am fascinating quite, boys. All Sham complexion brings me/him fame, &amp;c. (They all go off R. except Beppo, who watches them carefully off—then looking around him with an air of mystery, he comes cautiously down to the footlights. He then suddenly throws off all appearance of imbecility.) Beppo (with startling suddenness to audience) I am not what I seem! An idiot? No! Much farther from the truth you couldn't go! An idiot? Ha! ha! ha! My senses waning? The notion's really very entertaining! No doubt you think I'm water-on-the-brainy, A poor contemptible half-witted zany— A mere jack-pudding, trained to thump and thwack— A goose who travels with a noisy quack! I'm no such thing! away with this inaning! I am a mystery, that wants explaining! Why am I here in this disgraceful dress? Why do I paint my head with this black mess? Why thus affect the semblance of inanity? Affecting thus the zany—and inzanity? (confidentially) Well, then, I'm—(starts) Ha! (reassured) It's nothing! Well then, I'm— (mysteriously) But, soft—we are observed!—another time! (Enter Nemorino (R.) Beppo perceives him, and immediately resumes the demeanour of a zany. He dances off idiotically.) Nem Oh, happiness will surely turn my brain! To-morrow, I begin to live again! Then will my tanned complexion surely seem, Like intermingled strawberries and cream! My nose—which I inherit from my pater— Like geological deposits—straighter. And thanks to Rachel, wheresoe'er I go, I shall be stormed by every girl I know; Thus reproducing in this peacefull dell, That good old play, the sieging of Rachelle. (Enter at the back—Adina, on Belcore's arm, L., and all the female villagers arm-in-arm with the soldiers, unseen by Nemorino. He sings the following song without knowing that they are listening, until the chorus at the end.) Song and Chorus—(Nemorino.) Air—March from “Ching-Chow-Hi.” Nem Oh, happiness is in our reach! Chorus Oh! Nem Lovers will be found for each! Chorus Lo! Nem Maidens for my heart will sigh! Chorus So! Nem Beautiful for ever, I! Chorus No! Nem 'Dina I will go and see. Chorus Go! Go! Nem Slow my love for her will be. Chorus Slow! Nem Treat her as she treated me. (dancing) Happy Nemmy! happy Nemmy! ha, ha, ha! Happy Nemmy! happy Nemmy! ha, ha, ha! Chorus (dancing) Happy Nemmy! happy Nemmy! ha, ha, ha! &amp;c. (Nemorino perceives that he was overheard, and assumes a disconcerted look. Villagers go off R. laughing, leaving Nemorino, Adina, and Belcore.) Nem (annoyed) Oh, listening, madam! Adi (laughing) Well, of all the louts! The welkin's ringing with derisive shouts. Nem Then, by all rules by which I've been instructed, The welkin isn't very well kin-ducted. I love you not—to all your beauties I'm Insensible, though once upon a time I doated on you wildly—see my notes! Bel It's time you left off sowing your wild doats. Adi I wonder why! Nem You wonder why, you say! When through the town you wander all the day Without a chaperone—with him alone! Adi (tenderly to Belcore) What girl would not call such a chap her own? Nem It's pity, not contempt, for you I feel. (Belcore starts.) Adi (to Belcore) Don't hurt him—he's a harmless ne'er-do-weel Whom no girl speaks of in endearing tone— Nobody's Nenemy-no but his own (she sees Nemorino laughing). To-morrow week we wed. Nem (aside) For all your plotting, Before to-morrow night you'll send him trotting. Before the morning breaks, as I expect, My philtre will have worked its full effect; Her love will flow, however much I jilt her, In a clear stream, when to my lips comes philtre. Trio—Nemorino, Belcore, and Adina. Prelude to “Esulti per la barbara”—Elisir. Nem Right away I'll tod-tod-tod-tod-toddle, Right away I'll toddle—right away I'll toddle. Adi Grief has turned his nod-nod-nod-nod-noddle, Grief has turned his noddle, anyone can see. Bel Lovers all despairing—better far than wearing Faces as dispirited as faces well can be. Take him as your mod-mod-mod-mod-model, Take him as your model, take him as your model. All Right away I'll/he'll tod, &amp;c. (Enter Tomaso, R. U. E., with ill-concealed joy, followed by all the peasants; he gives sergeant a paper.) Tom There's a revolt in a far distant town— You're all to go to-night and put it down. You've no idea how all we fellows feel it— We're so affected, we can scarce conceal it: (They pretend to weep.) To-night you soldiers, one and all, clear out. Bel (contemptuously) That you're affected nobody could doubt (reads paper). (annoyed) Hum! pleasant for a man whose tastes are gluttony— Change for a mutiny these valleys muttony? Exchange for barrack, bugle call, and charge, gents, Chambers at Sergeant's Inn, through these insargents! (aside) To-night Adina I must off be carryin'-her; Though I'm a soldier I may be a marryin' her. (to Adina) Adina, hence to-night we start away, Your own Belcore will you wed to-day! (Goes down on his knees to her. Each of the soldiers goes down on his knees to the girl he is coupled with, imitating Belcore's action exactly.) Adi As Nemorino treats me now so ill, I do not hesitate to say I will! Belcore rises and kisses her. All the other girls intimate, with Adina, that they will marry their respective soldiers that day. Each of the soldiers rise and kisses his companion exactly at the same moment that Belcore does.) Nem Oh, don't to-day the fatal splicing make fast! Adi (decidedly) To-day—we hope to see you at the breakfast! (All the male peasants imply, in pantomime, to the village girls, that they hope they will put it off, and all the girls Concertld Quartette—Adina, Nemorino, Beppo, and Belcore. The four Airs to be sung together.) Air—“Alpen Horn.” Nem She'll wed to day I plainly see, In wedlock they'll united be. If I could make them wait a wee, The victory would rest with me! Air—“Gentil Hussard.” Tom To-day she will marry Belcore, Belcore, No argument can ever modify that; He's wealthy in pay and in glory, in glory, But that Nemorino's as poor as a rat. Air—“Polly Hopkins.” Bel Pretty, pretty preparations, Dinner and song—dinner and song; Dissi—dissi—dissipations, All the day long—all the day long. Air—“Buy a Broom.” Bep Oh, that I dared but relate you my history, Oh, that I only could speak of my woes! Sure, never was such a horrible mystery As I could tell you, if only I chose. (Scene closes, leaving Beppo on the stage.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Song—Dulcamara and Chorus. Air—“Hunkey Dorum.” Dul Dulcamara's come to town! Cho Dulcamara, doodlecum day! Dul Spend with him a single crown! Cho Dulcamara, doodlecum day! Dul Try his pills, and buy his Squills! Cho Dulcamara, doodlecum day! Dul No such ills as doctor's bills! Cho Dulcamara, doodlecum day!

      <field name="fulltext">Scene IV. —Interior of Adina's farm. Beppo on the stage. Bep So I'm alone again! Once more alone! Now for a highly intellectual tone! Let me disclose at leisure all I feel— Which I, to man, for worlds would not reveal! My only confidants are foolish mutes, And sticks and stones, and uninspired brutes! To use a Roman almanacky tone, Whate'er from men I 'ide, to them is known! Or would be—but some prying fool comes by, And interrupts my grand soliloquy! With them try to be confidential, comin' it— And be more definite—when they are dumb in it. To this mysterious dress and visage blistery, Some tale attaches—I may say, some 'istory. Now to reveal it—if you're not unnerved— Know, then, that I—but soft! we are observed! (Enter Nemorino L. Beppo resumes his expression of idiotcy, and retires up, unseen by Nemorino.) Nem The doctor says that I may yet, to-night, Adina win—Belcore put to flight If I but for one other bottle pay— (looking at coins) I've but three-ha'pence—so I must to-day, Borrow a loan, to free me from my sorrow, If not, I shall be quite alone to-borrow! 'Tis but a bob I want—if fate would send it me! (sees Beppo) The doctor's fool! He's mad—perhaps he'll lend it me! Bep (drivelling) Not I—not even if you were a dook! Nem I see you're not the idiot that you look. Bep (changing his tone) You think me mad? I'm not! Why, I intention it! Nem (after a pause) I think you're very right, my friend, to mention it. Bep It's an assumption—I, at will, can move it— I'm sane as you! Nem That's an assumption? Prove it. Duet—Nemorino and Beppo. Air—“The Nerves.” Bep My woeful tale will make you quail, Excuse me if I whine! (weeps.) Nem I don't suppose, that all your woes, Can nearly equal mine (weeps.) Bep I said before, and now, encore, As I just now observed— When I unveil my painful tale, You'll surely be unnerved! Both Unnerved, unnerved, unnerved, unnerved, He'll/I'll surely be unnerved. Nem I see, though foolishly he talks, He's sane, decidedlie, Bep You never were, by many chalks, As sane, my friend, as I— I'll tell you now, without a cram— But you will be unnerved— I am—I am—I am—I am— (starts) But soft, we are observed! Both Observed, observed, observed, observed, But soft, We/You are observed! (Enter Belcore, L. and marriage party. Beppo dances off idiotically.) Nem Adina lost! Once more I'll press my suit! Adina, take me—not this hulking brute! Adi This hulking brute, indeed—because he's bulky! I see, with half an eye, the brute who's 'ulky. Nem (desperately) I'll be a so'ger—when I'm shot you'll you'll weep. Adi Well, as you sowed yer crop so you must reap. Nem Or as a tar endeavour to forget you, Tossed on the briny wave— Adi How it will wet you! Nem And covered with sea-salt in every weather! Adi Oh, let this subject, sir, cease alt-ogether. With rage at your behaviour, sir, I burn! Nem Once more, then, to my diary I'll turn, And enter up my heart's most recent bleedings. (Enter Tomaso and Gianetta L., and Dulcamara R.) Tom Young man, you're-enter-upting the proceedings— (aside) It seems they all are going here to dine 'em, The deeds can wait—we'll after dinner sign 'em. Quintette—Adina, Belcore, Notary, Gianetta, and Dr. Dulcamara. Air—“I vowed that I never would leave her.” Adi We are all to be married to-day, In a way, you may say, That'll be undeniably gay— Oh, tootle-tum tootle-tum tay! Dul And the notary here in full fig, In a wig much too big, Will join us in jumping a jig— Oh, tootle-tum tootle-tum tay! Adi He'll turn about soon in a measure— So we'll be admitting with pleasure This rotary notary into our côterie— Tootle-tum tootle-tum tay! Bel You may open your wondering eyes With surprise at the size Of the joints and the puddings and pies Which are lavished upon you to-day! Gia So, notary, please take a seat, For to eat of the meat— For you won't often get such a treat— Oh, tootle-tum tootle-tum tay! Bel Surrounded by roses and myrtle, We'll stow within jerkin and kirtle Mock turtle, mock turtle, mock turtle, mock turtle, Mock turtle, mock turtle tum tay! Tom Indeed, you're exceedingly kind, I'm inclined—have a mind— And in fact, all along have designed, To join in your revels to-day. I'll join you, indubitablee, If so be we agree— That it isn't instead of my fee— Oh! tootle tum, tootle tum tay!

(Dance, and all dance off and R. and L., except Belcore and Nemorino.) Nem (seizing Belcore's hand, and bringing him down) I want a shilling! Bel No uncommon want Nem Can you oblige me? Bel Certainly I can't. But—here's the Queen's—come, be a soldier, lad? Nem A soldier? Come, the notion isn't bad. Bel A shilling down—next week, a dozen more, I'll be your banker for at least a score! Nem (aside) In wars alarms I shall be soon delighting, The only prospect that's at all in-fighting! (to Bel) Yes, I'm your boy. I love the beat of drum— You'll find me snap at dangers, when they come! Bel (contemptuously) A snapper of the kind that's known as whipper! A shop-boy! Nem Yes—but no encounter-skipper— I'm the most dashing fellow ever seen! Bel A haber-dashing fellow, p'r'aps you mean, Nem An insult! Ha! (draws stiletto) Bel Come, stop this boyish rancour, You've early learnt to draw upon your banker! Duet—Belcore and Nemorino. Air—“Jog along Boys.” Nem Well, thanks to you I've got the tin My dear Adina for to win, This shilling, please to understand, Will purchase dear Adina's hand. Bel When you within my clutches come I'll tie you up to the beat of drum— With thump and whack, and bump and crack, The cat shall lacerate your back. Both For it's flog along, flog along, flog along, boys, Flog along boys, for the cat'll make a noise, Flog along, flog along, flog along, boys, Flog along, boys, Hurrah! (Dance off together.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene V. —The Village Green. (Enter Gianetta R., meeting Catarina and female peasants L.) Cat Our peasants say they'll join the sergeant's troop! Belcore's 'listing all at one fell swoop! Ricardo, Nemorino, and Elvino, And Carlo, and Edgardo, and Jackino, Have gone to join him. Gia (contemptuously) Well, they won't be mis't, They are quite free to go, Miss, where they 'list! But what has caused it, goodness only knows. Cat Oh! jealous of the soldiers, I suppose! They all declared together they would ride hence (whispering) They saw us cooing? Gia What a cooing-cidence! (Enter Tomaso.) Tom It is—and I can tell you, if I will— Of one that's more extraordinary still— Ricardo, Nemorino, and Elvino, And Carlo, and Edgardo, and Jackino, Each has his uncle lost! Gia What will they do? They were so fond of those relations too! Their cartes-de-posits always had about them! Their uncles? Why, what will they do without them? Tom Why, what is stranger still, girls—is it not?— Each uncle leaves his nephew all he's got; So if these nephews you're disposed to fleece, To them you'd best go down upon your kniece. Cat Ricardo! 1st Peas. Nemorino! 2nd Peas. Dear Elvino! 3rd Peas. And Carlo! 4th Peas. Sweet Edgardo! 5th Peas. Loved Jackino! Gia (to Catarina) They're all worth catching, dearest, every man— Go and secure your prize, dear, if you can. Cat But I'm so naïve—so led by Nature's rule. Tom (aside) I think I may say you're more knave than fool! I must propose at once, or I'll be done. (lovingly to Gianetta) And won't you ever kindly think of one Who, to accommodate your whims, will try— Who thinks you are the apple of his eye. Gia Of one of them—that's very likely, since His apples are not pairs. Tom How so? Gia He squince! Trio—Tomaso, Gianetta, and Catarina. Air—“Lin and Tin.” Tom Now maidens all, these youngsters tall, You'd all do well to wed— They've all come in to no end of tin, For their uncles all are dead. Cat We do not doubt that all you spout To-day's extremely true— Gia But all they'll say, when they hear us pray, Is “Oodley umpty oo!” Chorus—Oodley umpty oo! &amp;c. Each girl's engaged to one, Tom Well tell them, you know, that they all may go, Why every day it's done! But all they'll say, when they hear us pray, Is—Oodley oodley umpty oo! (Dance off R. and L.) (Enter Dr. Dulcamara with Beppo. Nemorino, Notary, and male peasants meet them.) Bep Walk in, walk in, walk in, walk in, walk in! The doctor's just a-going to begin! He's going to commence, indeed it's true! (aside, with deep feeling) Come hence! Go hence is what I'd like to do! (aloud, with melodramatic action) I can NOT keep it any longer—I'm— But humph! no matter! Well, some other time. Dul My learned friend will walk around the show, If he'll allow me so to call him? Bep (bowing with exaggerated action) Oh! (Beppo clears a space, with a rope and two balls, around Doctor's cart.) Dul Now, Mr. Merriman, around you go! Bep Merriman! Ha, ha! Merriman! Ho, ho! (aside) But soft! another time for that will do. Dul Now Nemorino, how can I help you? Nem (sighing) My sorrow's in my humble bosom locked. Dul Ha! chest disease! I'm really very shocked. You'd better far inhale, as you can see, If you in hale condition wish to be. Nem No—it's too dear. Bep An undisputed cure! His profit isn't great—success is sure. One single farthing now is all he's sacked— One trial, gentlemen, has proved the fact. Nem To puff those wares, you needn'nt now endeavour, We want a dozen—“Beautiful for ever.” That we to-day may fascinating be. Tom You'll let me pay you when I've got my fee? 'Twill do you credit. Bep Pooh—you're talking trash! We don't want credit—what we want is cash! Dul I give no tick at all—to sane or sick— It's cost you cash—although it is cos'-me-tic. (Nemorino buys and pays for a sufficient number of bottles to give one to each peasant.) Tom (expostulating) That doesn' square with what I think is sound. Bep The gentleman has stood a dozen round. (Peasants all uncork the bottles and rub the contents simultaneously on their faces.) Nem How do we look? Dul Enchanting, all the lot. Tom (very conceitedly) You couldn't photograph us on the spot? Dul (to Beppo, alluding to Notary) You'd hardly know him, but for wig and hose— (pointing to wig) That shows the Notary! Bep Quite an autre-y chose! Nem There goes all that I got by my enlisting, That Dulcamara there is no resisting! Dul Well, as for that, I'm such a wheedling talker, Some people call me Dulcamary Walker! But that's absurd—it's plain to any man, I'm not a Mary—I'm a Charlotte-Ann. Quartette—Dulcamara, Nemorino, Beppo, and Tomaso. Air—“Old Sarah Walker.” Tom Such a change was never known—why, how beautiful you've grown! Your mother if she saw you now would tremble, Bep His mother, ha, ha, ha! how the words upon me jar; But soft, I am observed—I must dissemble! Nem When my face the maidens see, I shall happy, happy be! Of my wounds Adina soon will be a caulker. Dul Well, a phase of woman's mission is to act as a physician— The sentiments of Dulcamary Walker! Bep Tol de dol de dol, &amp;c. I think a time has come, when no more I shall be dumb; But soft—on second thoughts I will postpone it. Tom By this time, I daresay, I'm as beautiful as they, If Nemorino there would only own it. Nem Adina will be mine, and together we will shi— She'll take my arm and be a loving talker! Dul In woman there's a charm when she's taking off an arm— The sentiments of Dulcamary Walker! Bep Tol de dol de dol, &amp;c. (All dance off, except Nemorino, who leans against a tree.) (Enter Adina—she does not see Nemorino.) Adi Oh, am I not a dreadful little story, To throw up Nemorino for Belcore? My love to Nemorino back I'll carry— Besides, the Sergeant can't get leave to marry. Of money Nemmy's come into a store— A coin-cidence that, and nothing more, And doesn't influence me in the least. (sees him) Ah, there he stands! Oh, how my love's increas't! (goes to him) Why sit so glum and still? You well might be A marble man beneath a stony tree— A petrifaction quite, as stiff as starch. Nem (pointing to tree) Adina, this is not the marble (L)arch Adi How thin and pale you look, from constant sighing! To think that for Adina he is dying! Nem I'm not dead yet, though I'm as thin as spillikens: You are A-dina, but I'm not a Willikens. Adi It's true, Belcore's got a lot of money— But if you'll have me I'll be sweet as honey! Nem I'm sage enough to know you love this money 'un. Adi You're sage; but what is sage without a honey 'un? Nem (aside) That the Elixir's working now it's plain. At first I'll cool indifference maintain (whistles). (aloud) Don't bother me, you false, coquettish jade! Adi You've steeled your heart, just like your dagger-blade— Just as in Don Giovanni did Masetto! Nem My blade? I see, because my heart's to let O! In that condition I am not alone, Your heart is steeled as wall. Adi Its all your own!

I'll settle this (to Nemorino) there—you're on soldier's pay, Come, quick march! several hundred miles away— And stand on sentry there, till you're relieved. Adi To disappoint you, sir, I'm deeply grieved (giving money to sergeant.) (to Nemorino) You're free—I've paid your smart! Nem What's that you're sayin'— Have you paid much? No smart, dear, without pay in' Trio—Adina, Belcore, Nemorino. Air—“The Mousetrap Man.’ Nem (to Belcore) Don't it occur that you rather intrude? Back to your quarters you'd much better wend— I should be sorry to seem to you rude, But we should be grieved to detain you, my friend! Bel I hardly know whether I sleep or I wake, At owning defeat I'm uncommonly slow— But this is behaviour, unless I mistake, That's meant as a hint that she wants me to go! Adi Heigho, Nemorino! This Bel-core may go. We can be happy, my dear, on your late Deeply lamented old uncle's estate! All Heigho, Nemorino, &amp;c.

Dul Then please to let us have it in a word, you silly fellow! Bep Look at me—look at me! Don't you seem to know me well, oh? Look at me—look at me! Don't you seem to know me well, oh?
