      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus, Scena Prima. Enter King, Appius, Selucus and Attendants. King. Selucus you know the soule of our designe Lies in the speedy and silent execution Of the Plot, let us not presume in their securitie Till we fall in our owne, but goe, and when They have begirt the place, give us notice that With our charge they may at once, feare and feele Their danger, and by us be cloath'd in ruine Ere they know whose livery they weare. Exit Selucus. This if Fortune be a goddesse and joyne With justice, and with her strength will assist Our industrie; must be, for where justice Strikes, in what corner of the earth can victory Hide her selfe, and that youthfull hand Not finde her. Ap. I should blush at this If there needed more arguments to confirme I shall be victorious: then the reward Purposd, for had the Gods intended the farre fam'd Claracilla's vertues a reward for treason, They would not then have left her vertue Such a guard, whose power hath stood Amongst Traytors, when yours fell upon The faith that bore it. King. You oblige me Sir, and this sweetnesse Makes me begge you will be pleasd to let me Once agen call to your memory some Particulars of that tedious story My miseries made me recount to you; this Traytor Silvander, having by my love gaind an interest And by my smiles climb'd over the head of all His fellowes, in the strength of this trust, grew Too powerfull for me, and in a battaile where My cause onely strucke, got the day. Ap. These are faults the Gods must punish, But his usurpation of the Princesse, and Intended rape, which in a marriage he labours, Are those that blow my rage. King. Tis true, it has alwayes beene his ayme, But his love by the gods appointed for his Punishment; and our guard has given her a constant Power over him, which we have so directed That shee has prevail'd with him to quit his greatest strength And retreate with her to this private villa Where now he remaines, onely attended by some Few troopes of horse, this opportunitie we owe Her pietie, that has put it in our power to strike For our revenge, and right agen. Enter Selucus. Sel. Arme Sir, and behold how in the obedience Of your command they are lost, ruine in silence Like growth steales upon them, th'are now empal'd And destruction hovers, yet undiscover'd To the prey, but deferre no time, for night makes Hast away, the cause hath such a glory Cast about the souldier, that it forceth day, And victory in the resolution waites But your command. King. Sir pray be pleasd to give These lost men their doomes, the signal's yours. Ap. Tis an honour and I accept it, and thus give it, follow me. Exit. King. And that souldier that shall refuse such a signall Let his weighty feares sinke him where he stands, Come Selucus. Exit. Sel. Come Selucus, had not wont to be the word upon a charge Of love, thy power hath disarm'd me, or rather envy Hath disarm'd my love, could it be else That I should stand thus unfold in Claracilla's cause Whilst others guild their swords in her revenge, Charge. It could not be, harke how eagerly they pursue My misery, cruell honour puts me in, and tells me I lose my interest in her, unlesse by giving Wounds I pull on mine owne. Exit. Enter Melintus, Timillus, and Iacome. Mel. Come Timillus let us haste to the Charge, Lest our friends beleeve feare declinde our haste, And we are early enough, if we succeede, To let them see we have brought the wishes of friends. Tim. Faith and if we doe not succeede we shall finde we came too soone, I am sure I shall in an overthrow, I am certaine to get my share, when I list to want an enemy my friends shall knocke me o'th head, for I thanke my fates, Fortune has beene as bountifull of her mischiefes to me as an enemy could wish, and that's but a hard condition youle say, for a man like mine that cannot aske rewards when he does well. Mel. Mention not that here, when rewards grow within thy reach, every daring forehead, and if Timillus dares not gather them a must goe without. Tim. You are ever thus snappish till I am angry, and then I fight to my owne ruine not my enemies, one would thinke you might allow a man his humour, and not be forc'd to fight your quarrell, but hee must fight your way too. Mel. Yes, yes, prethe no more. Tim. Now my choller is up I shall strike, but like Iohn of the Clocke house, that way my face stands; Iacomo keepe you out of the belfree. Mel. Leave this discourse now Timillus, and follow me. Exit. Tim. And what wilt thou doe Iacomo. Ia. Who I? follow my master. Tim. No prethee let us be friends, choose some other place, for I am resolv'd to keepe that my selfe, till I am beaten from it. Ia. You are merry, but I have seene them clawd e're now that have taken it, but I hope youle finde better fortune. Tim. A pox of Fortune, she has no such thing as good or bad belongs to her, follow me, and if we gaine the day I'le give her thee. Charge. Exit. Enter Claracilla and Olinda. Olin. Fly Madam, these enemies bring your freedome. Cla. Be constant Heaven. Enter Silvander. Sil. What ho, Claracilla, gentle Claracilla Dost thou flie me too, nay then I'me lost indeede. Thou mightst have had mercy tho no love, And preserv'd me for thy owne sake, for in this Fall of mine, thou hast a hand in ruining thy Owne Temple, nor canst thou after this ingratitude Be term'd the just, however the faire Claracilla. Enter Titius. Within flie flie. Tit. Fly Sir, flie, all's lost. Nor is it courage but despaire staies yee, when Safetie is already fled beyond the reach of men. Sil. Doe thou flie fond wretch and in thy fate Thou runst to finde how vaine thy counsell is, No, Claracilla's cruell, I will not stirre A foote that leades from danger, nor vainely Attempt to escape the hand of heaven, unlesse I could hide me from his eyes too. Enter Melintus wounded. What art thou that wear'st such death About thee? and look'st as if Thou cam'st to put of thy habit here. Silvander stands in amaze. Mel. Tis not you I looke for, 'tis something That shot from heaven before me, she appeard Like innocence her selfe striking in her owne cause; Saw you not that starre, did she not in her ascent Passe this wayâhe minds not me Melintus offers to goe away. Sil. Tis so, this youth but saw her, and hees overcome, Stay, what ere thou art that once againe I may see thy face, and reade the story Which love and anger appeares so mingled in. Now by all our gods, 'tis nobly writ, and had I met it when I commanded fortune, I would Have studied thee, and by obligations have grafted Thee my friend, but since that power is gone He drawes his Sword. By this and my name, I command thee be my Priest, Know Silvander the unfortunate calls thee backe. Mel. Silvander, Oh ye Gods, what power ye give To treason, that name hath disperst the cloud That passion threw betwixt him and the revenge Of a Fathers murder call'd unfortunate as wicked, What fate rul'd thee thus to call me back. Sil. Prethee youth no noise; I was a traytor, but true to our King And yet his power commanded me, and Could my love to Claracilla have consented To have wonne such a Iewell in lesse then A Crowne, or beene satisfied to have seene her Whom I preferd before the Gods, stood second to any Thou in all thy wounded faith which thus adornes thee, Shouldst not have out-shind me this day in Ioyaltie. Mel. Love and treason mixt, know, though thou Hast prov'd thy selfe a cunning Chymist In attempting to destroy that noble body, Yet I have that here shall in spight of all thy Adulterate mixtures restore and fix it, guard thee. Sil. Prethee threaten not, for tho I prophesie Thou bring'st my winding sheete, yet thou shalt see My smiles with scorne wreath it about me, And yet I meane not to fall unlike a souldier Not be buried without my rights about me, My Sword upon my breast thus, and therefore guard thee. Mel. Guard me, tis the office of the gods to kill thee Is to doe the execution, and the way As safe as that the Ministers of justice Tread, and were it as noble as just, I would Command thee hold thy necke, But I scorne such wayes to my revenge, And therefore will take an equall tryall. Sil. This youth must overcome, Honour And justice both strike for him! and though I fall I shall live in his fame! Mel. Yeeld and your person's safe, for 'twas Against your cause, not you. Sil. And ere this darknesse hath quite shadow'd Me, heare my story, that as thou hast punish'd My treason, thou mayst pitty my misfortune; And thus when I am gone report of me, Silvander bow'd to a cruell power, who When he had offerd all that a lovers thought Could compasse, and the power of a King Worne onely to serve in, when that power Lessen'd, and my offerings came to be in the heart, Not hand, and my prayers because unperfum'd, Vnheard, and I the offerer Thus made the sacrifice; O gentle youth! Would any bow to such a power as flies Vs in our miseries, or worship that Image Which thus falls upon her Priest? Dies. Mel. Vnfortunate indeede, as all men are That build upon faults, but I will not say I pitty thee, For where a King once grew, to sow pitty Is the worst of changes. Exit. Enter Appius and Selucus. Sel. This way Sir he went, if be me mortall, But his stay's so short, that we but seeme To follow in the tract he makes. Ap. Let us lose no time then in overtaking him That we may assist his worke. Sel. I will not fight a foote further that way If there be no enemies backwards, Ile make some, Death, Ile not take Mars his leavings in the field Ap. Come Selucus turne this fire the right way, And 'twill light thee to finde out honour. Sel. It has don't, but to day she is too busie In obeying one mans fortune that my wounds Are not current to purchase her. Ap. We are sure he is this way for heer's his marke, Where ere he goes he makes death his character, Know yee this that beares it. Sel. Know him! yes, this stroke killd not a Traytor But treason it selfe fell here, this is Silvander, And hee's goneâenvie be not propheticke, aymes Beyond a crowne, it must be Claracilla; Then yee gods whether else tends this youths flight, Or what but she can satisfie, when a King Cannot, this doubt makes me Pursue him through a dangerous knowledge. Exit. Enter Claracilla and Melintus following her. Cla. Sure this stranger knowes me not, he pursues me As if I were part of the enemy. Mel. O stay, for know since I have once agen seene My fate Ile reade it, what ever it be, tis Written in so faire a bookeâ see unconfident He kneeles. Of my armes I begge your stay, he begs that Dealt death as oft as wounds to his opposers In thy pursuite your feares wrong me, he That dares fight with men will not warre with beauty And this sword that hath cut through so many Fates this day to finde mine owne, tremble not; For it hath ever been the servant of justice not cruelty. Cla. Sir, I know not guilt enough to beget a feare, Yet if you meane me no harme why doe you Pursue me, and neglect th'advantage fortune threw Vpon your daring youth, have you such choyce Of honour, you scorne to stoope for this, that you Have ventur'd so far for, what dresse would you weare? What beauties would your youth put on to make it Lovely, when those wounds a Crowne and conquest Cannot satisfie, when the heart thinkes these? No harvest, where would thy sword sow thy hazzards To reape one more glorious. He rises. Mel. Faire soule goe on, and whilst you blame the effect Ile reade the cause, and thus looke upon the conquest Crowne and reward I strucke for, if ever I Have triumph it must passe through those Arches In gentle smiles, and whilst I enjoy this happinesse Let the Crowne and lawrell passe by, as the lesser Good, nor would I give this to possesse the blessings That attend them all. Cla. Heaven grant this fruite be from a noble stocke And yet tis safer 'twere not, for I feare I am not proofe against such vertue, 'twas the dresse My Melintus wore when he appeard most comely. Nor neede I doubt him, for never honour grew Where 'twas not sow'd, Sir you forgot your wounds, They exact a care. Mel. No faire one, I am now powring Balme into them And could I hope you would afford this way Of cure, 'twould beene health, to not be heald, She turnes away. Why doe you turne away, and let my truthes Fall ere they reach your eares, is it your feares That would remove you, let this secure you Tho I appeare in this bloody dresse more like a Priest, Yet I am a sacrifice, and that sacrifice Which once was acceptable to you. Cla. Sure I have heard that voyce, Sir for heavens sake Wound me not with doubt; who are you? Mel. Are there no lines in all this misery That you can call to mindeânor the Print He pulls a patch from his eyes. Of one joy which you set there. Cla. Oh yes there is. She leanes on him and weepes. Mel. Oh Claracillaâsoule of honour, why doe you not In charitie quit your vertue, 'tis single here That I may throw off my paine. Cla. Oh Melintus, you must not wish it, Melintus Can bravely suffer, he is a Souldier, loves Souldier, but honours Leaderâlet me weepe My soule into thy noble brest, this payment I can make to none but to thy selfe, those teares That were due to absence, sadnesse payd thy memory: Oh let me rest upon thee, my joyes are Too great a load to beareâand feele how this Melintus here, beates to meete Melintus there. Mel. Oh ye Gods, tis Paradice sure, the way was so rugged That leads to it. Cla. 'Tis a great power we serve, nor is it more Seene in his punishment that parted us Then in this reward, but let us not my soule Be two expressive in our joyes, it may Displease those powers that have bin thus favorable, And my Melintus had not wont to sacrifice unto Himselfe, and so forget the gods. She offers to goe from him. Mel. Oh gentle Claracilla remove not from me, For you mistake the posture, the breast is Loves altar, and the seate of friendship, and For sacrifice, is not Claracilla a fuller Offering in either kinde, then a Cake or Spice But I submit for Melintus shall never know A reason to contradict Claracilla. Cla. Yet let us remember what we owe to your safety The care of your wounds too, but that I know Melintus ever plac'd dangers behinde his love I should ere this have prompted you to a care ofâ Mel. For my wounds the cause will heale them, to me You owe nothing for your deliverance; your freedome Grew here, and your enemies mistaking the place In search of my dangers digg'd it out and you Shall finde this truth in the beauty of the scarres they leave. Oh Claracilla thy faith makes me smile through all this bloodâ But harke, I heare we are pursu'd, this upon Your faire hand, and then let me hide my love And hame under my disguise. He puts on his patch. Cla. 'Tis good night Melintus, now thou hast put out The light, and like love himselfe th'art blinde, And thou art all I worship of that god. Enter Appius and Selucus. Sel. See where he stands my feares were true The Princesse in his hand too, he holds her like His prey in the footâSir tho you fought well Yet this Lady will not prove your reward, She cannot be a Prisoner here. Mel What I did well was rewarded in the fact; And for this Lady I am so farre from hoping She should be my prisoner, that I would Have sufferd all the misery of warre B're strucke one blow against her freedome. Sel. Here is a Prince, whose youthfull Ere blowne With desire to serve you through thousand hazards Hath this day courted your favour, and in his hand You will seeme more aptly worne. Ap Madam, tho friendship seeme to direct, you Have an interest that commands here, and tis Honour enough, if you please to let me kisse your hand. Cla. Sir, Civilities are alwayes fruitfull, and beget Civilities if they meete with honour, which I hope Shall not be wanting to give a growth to what You venture here. Mel. Madam I see 'tis not my opinion onely But this Lords too, that I am unworthy of this honour. Cla. If it be an honour weare it, you first secur'd it. Sel. Will you make your hand the reward of fortune And scatter your favours so that they be had For stooping, is that an honour due to the first commer, If so I grutch it not, for such favours, and Vpon such ties he may weare it, else I should be loath to stoope to he, that bowes to him. Cla. You are insolent. Mel Thus Madam be pleas'd to accept your due, and then Give me leave to exact mineâSir, let nor your interest Here, and the opinion you have but a single enemy Make you presume to injure me nor so Mistake my bountie as to thinke I have throwne My blood away in vanitie; for tho I see. No price upon my wounds, and contract not for Killing of a Traytor, yet I can tell Whether I am bid faire or no when I have don't, 'Tis nobler farre to give a Courtesie Then sell it under, doe you smile? it may be You have had good markets, and such weake chapmen For those good few deeds you have done. Sil. Yes, but if you were from this place, I would make Thee pay deare for one, which should on thy Heart write thou wert but my Factor, and all the honour Thou art dect with, but my store. Mel. You promise to your selfe too faire, and noyses Fright onely when we are ignorant of the cause And there's too much in thee, to have a dangerous death. Ap. Hold SelucusâSir when you know his good You will pardon this ill, nor doe I meane it An injury to shew by his envie what value He sets upon your glories, and I make No doubt, when his reason hath purg'd this Choller From his honour, you'le finde him a healthy friend And his acquaintance, not subject to these sickly passi?s If he does as of a suretie command my faith To make this good. Mel. Sir I can easier beare injuries that I deserve not, Then receive obligations that I cannot pay; For injuries have a curse growing within my reach, But obligations I must suffer under their weight, If you propose not the remedy. Ap. Come embrace, Selucus had not wont To hate the person of an enemy, much lesse Fall in love with injuries, especially when jealous Honour begets them upon mistakes amongst friends. Selucus salutes him and speakes by. Sel. Love and honour, farewell to both, My ends are the gods Ile worship now, and my nets Once throwne, Ile catch them tho they swim in blood. Enter King and Attendants. Cla. See my royall Father, and I have reap'd My blessings ere I have paid my offering, Thus to the gods, I bow in pious obedience here to you King. Welcome deare Claracilla, rise, twice borne To a Crowne, twice parent, &amp; twice the issue of my joyes And merit all the blessings that my prayers Sacrifice can call downe upon thee, and you Sir To whom we stand thus oblig'd for unmerited favors Since you have left no other way to returne Take the blushes you have begot, and be pleasd To let us know your name and country, that Our gratefull mentions may not fall like darts Throwne at nothing, sure 'tis a gratefull one That has such store of vertues, that she can spare From her helme such a Pilot in the course of honour. Mel. Your pardon royall Sir, for disobeying your command, My Country I dare not tell, for as my parent I would hide her name, and my name is, where Tis knowne so displeasing, that I dare not Venture it here, where I would remaine. An humble servant. King. Come my Claracilla, Let not the heart forget to sacrifice Vnto the hand, thus acknowledging to the meanes And forget the power that commands them, but remember That the gods though they are oft times seene But in the successe and latter end of things, yet their Place is first, and ought to be so in our worship. Mel. In the morning I shall begge leave to visit you. Cla. I hope so. Exit. Mel. Sure I have surpriz'd my joyes, they had not wont, Enter Timillus. To come thus naked, thus like Angels, whose Cloathing is all we see, the rest is mysteryâ My friend! pardon when I forget my selfe if thou Appearst lost in my joyes. Sel. He is alone, and something Ile doe, but stay who's this? Tim. Prethee call thy bird backe againe, for mine is flowne, that we may have something to trust to, this is the comfort of a Comrade, a man may goe halfes, and be both savers. Mell. Thou art wounded. Tim. Why doe you wonder I should get a wound, I wonder I got no more, I am sure I have beene where fewer have beene dealt ere now, and yet more has falne to my share, but by this hand I am glad thou hast got some of Fortunes goods, as they call them by this wrackeâI had a Smocke too, but it tore in taking up, what are those that stand so at distance, are they enemies or none. Mel. Where? O no. Tim. Why then they are worse, for they are friends that will be. Mel. Th'are enemies to nothing but this daies fortune, For yet they know not me. Tim. Enemies to nothing but this dayes fortune, I prethee what subject is there else for their hate, or wish but the wounds, and those are things I beleeve few covet else on my conscience, one or other would have had mine e're this time. Sel. I must take some other time. Exit. Mel. They are gone. Tim. Let em goeâand now prethee tell meâwhat was thatâthat sheeâthat went in, as thou lov'st me let her not be ransom'd, till I have hung these fetters about her for a night, by this hand wee'le share. Mel. Dost thou know what thou hast said? Tim. What I have said, no nor yet doe care, but pray what have I sayd? Mel. That which thoult be asham'd of when thou know'st of whom. Tim. Why, I have not lyed Melintus, and for the who in woman, tis a thing I looke not after when mine eye is pleas'd, the Sex blesseth all the rest, the who, and what belongs to those fooles enquires, that hunts marriage. Mel. Come you will be asham'd when you shall know This is that Claracilla, that thou hast heard me In teares so often mention, that vertue Which thou so admird'st from my relation, and whose Noble sweetnesse hath made kindred and dutie To my King the least tyes of the love and respect I beare her. Tim. She is honest thenâand no hope left by this hand, I'le be overcome hereafter and get more by it then such a conquest where a man gets nothing but cold honour. Doe you heare Melintus though she be a vertue as you call it. I hope there is a vice belongs to her. Mel. Prethee put off this humour; repine at the Growth of honour; sad because a faire woman's honest. Tim. No Sir, I am glad she is honest because it seemes honesty pleaseth you, but an honest woman to me is a booke I could never reade in, nor can I imagine why we should study them, they are secrets that teach but to one mans knowledge, and the best of them are worst, a knowledge whose birth is ignorance, and Ile not traffique for such commodities as are not vendible; and by this day, the very thought shee should be faire and honest, hath made me dry, looke how white I spit; let me goe that I may be drunke and forget the sad cause. Mel. Drunke thou canst not, thou hast a leake will preserve thee Twill passe ere it come to fuming, you had best looke to that. Tim. That, what? Who pox I can stop that with my finger. Mel. Come prethee leave thy fooling, and let me see't I hope tis not dangerous. Tim. No, no, never feare it, this narrow lane will not prove my highway to heaven. Mel. Prethee come away then we shall be observ'd To be so long together. Tim. Hang observers, I'me sure they'le be yours, for I ne're had any. Exit.</field>

Strip those slaves, and to the banke chaine the Cowards Slavery, 'tis no new thing to such as feare, And Tullus loose that Rhodian on the Starboard banke; Me thought that fellow look'd as if he were Not justly yoak'd with misery, in the heate Of the fight I saw him shake his chaine, like A fierce Dog held from the Chace. Tul. Sir. Man. Vrge me no more, Iustice as well as blood Has an interest in the revenge I take, And that makes it healthy, tho it may be That which anger hunts would taste as sweete. Enter Philemon. Tul. Sir your pardon, tis my ignorance in the cause Of your displeasure made me mediate for them. Man. And because Tullius shall not thinke that Manlius Would in misery expect, the compassion That he would not give, you shall know why. I refuse these my Country men in misery The mercy I found from thee in mine. Tull. Sir not that I doubt you have one; but the desire To know it makes me beg you would relate The cause, Tullius can be but faithfull When he has heard it, and that I hope is Not to be question'd now. Man. Know then in that day when treason flew above Iustice, and false Silvander enrich'd by his masters trust Out-vyd the noble King with his owne bounty Who too late found his love had not bred a friend But begot a Traytor, 'twas upon that day The brave Thisander fell, the interest I had in this fault Heaven I hope hath pardon'd as well as punish'd; But to be short, our party having gain'd the day, The crowne, and beautie that attended it, The faire Claracilla fell into the hands Of false Silvander, where her vertues by daily seeing Them, dispersd the Clowd ambition had set betwixt My loyalty and me, and then too late I repented what I had done, yet not willing To despaire before I had attempted something; I undertooke an act, which if heaven had smil'd on Might have redeem'd my forfeit honour, 'twas To heale the wounds I made with the blood of The surpriz'd Traytor, whose fall I had decreed In the midst of all these false glories. Tul. How came it justice was so absent to her owne cause. Man. His sinnes it seemes were not ripe, nor this pument. That heaven design'd him, which by this I hope Is fully paid, but the particuler, one night. Being in the Princesse chamber contriving Her escape, which we resolv'd should be e're I gave the blow, a guard seiz'd me and no cause given I was sent to my ruine as he design'd There your gratitude preserv'd me afterwards Learnt the occasion, that these men whom fortune Now has given into my power urg'd the fust-burnt Traytor To a rape upon the Princesse, &amp; with a forc'd marriage. Counseld him to confirme his title, and blew in his Eare that there was love betwixt the princesse and me Which if his care remov'd not, would prove A hindrance to his designe, and from this Grow this necessitie, which made me receive The command my better fortunes gave your merit; Now be you Iudge whether or no they see Iustice In this punishment. Tul. 'Tis visible they bow under a weight That justice hath laid upon them, and my gally Is both a prison and Sanctuary. Phi. Is this Manlius, and this the cause of his disgrace. Man But see the slave I sent for, Tullius Was he bought or taken? Tul. 'Tis one of that Gang defended the Rhodian When we lost so many men in fight. Man. I remember the story, but how came it He was left when you sold the rest. Tul. They did not like the price, besides he was dogged And that made me put him to the Oare. Man. Of what country art thou, and thy name? Phi. Of no country, nor no name in Chaines; Slaveâis a beingâthat what has beene, is Of no force against, else my name and country Are not thinges to be asham'd of. Man. Yes if you thinke they have power to gaine your freedome Y'are too blame to keepe them hid. Phi. I have vow'd not to discover till I have my freedome, and I will not. Man. Why so doggedly? Phi. Why not, what is there in my fortune that needs feare A worse condition, or what danger in a slave Worth your consideration what he saies, if you dare Venture a good deede give me credit for one, And set me free. Man. No, no, we must not be forc'd to a benefit; Tullius command thy Gally to put from shore And lye loose to night to be ready if there be Occasion offerd, we will stay a shore to night And expect what issue this dayes trouble hath.

Yes I was of the Rodian gang, and chiefe Tho you know it not, and had our seconds beene men Of soules and not made up of feares, might have Playd your parts now, to what a misery of condition I am falne; the last Mart because I was wounded No body would buy me, the soule of a slave In their esteeme not weighing downe his limbes; Yee gods either send me libertie, or take Your gifts againe, honour, and her issue courage; Iustice! faithfulnesse are of no use to me, Who would be judg'd by a slave, courage in chaines What can it hurt, or to be faithfull of what use When we are not trusted? Oh my fate, why was I borne free? Had I beene bred a slave I Could have sung in my chaines, nay to have perish'd In them had beene dying in my calling, but to fall From greatnesse, and without a fault be punishd With the guilty, nay where the guilty scape. False Rhodes my curse kindle a fire within thee, The freedome that my soule brought thither threw me Into her dangers, which their cowardise Had made such certaine ruine in their apprehension That not one amongst them had man enough To looke upon their feares, I then a God was held Because I durst venture this to become a sacrifice. Exit. Enter Selucus solus. Sel. Yee gods by what waves or markes should men Follow what is good, when vertue her selfe Does not alwayes keepe one path, when Claracilla Which has all I know of vertue, shall quit The godlike attribute of truth, and the guard Which innocence secures her from impious men with, And flye for safetie to an excuse, she denyd My visit at the price of a lye, and at That rate of sinne bought a strangers company; Olinda assures me hee's at this time with her: But why doe I thus without danger barke Against him, and let this tree without a roote thus lye That can beare me no more fruit stand in my prospect? It shall not, I will see her, and since she can So put off her honour, as to lye for one man, Who knowes but she may lie with more? Exit. Enter Melintus and Claracilla. Mel. You have now heard all the passages of my life Since that sad day we parted to this happy houre Which if poore Philemon had liv'd to see How happy had we three beene. Cla. Have you not heard of him, since his losse at Rhodes? Doe you beleeve him dead? Mel. My love makes me beleeve what I feare, for he Had many wounds, besides I know his ransome Would have pleasd the Conqueror better then his bond For they were Pirats, but no more of this Sad subject now. Cla. Oh Melintus grow not weary of mentioning a friend, Tho it be sad 'tis joy, and let that beare The weight, had Philemon liv'd to have seene me And Melintus lift, we should have buried our dayes In your story ere suffer'd thy name to have pass'd Vnmention'd, Philemon to his friend a lambe And in such softnesse he alwayes wore his Lyons heart; Philemon whose youth had growth with us, a plant By the same hand set, a flower from our owne stocke; And all his sweetnesse a kin to us, and we Ought to be ally'd to his misfortunes, but why doe I Teach Melintus, tis boldly done to give lawes to him That is such a master in the rights of friendship. She weepes. Mel. To let you see I love Philemon, I doe not grudge Him that precious dew, and gentle Claracilla, Witnesse my soule hath one consent with yours, See I can beare you company in your owne Sex. Cla. Oh yee gods he weepes; Melintus weepes What agonie must this noble youth feele When his soule sweats such drops, pardon me for Thus stirring thy griefe. Mel. Doe not thinke I left the subject because I was weary of the discourse, or could Enough mention Philemon that durst be my friend When 'twas certaine ruine, and now hee's dead, I breake no trust to tell you the cause was a greater Tie then any effect it had, know Philemon Was in love with Claracilla, and 'twas with Claracilla. And not himselfe, for when by my trust he Found your softnesse and receiv'd impression From my constant love, and you were pleas'd to call me Your Melintus, I became his too, and to serve us In our wishes was all the heaven he aym'd at: And now my soule either you must confesse me Vnworthy or else grant such daring courage And such fearefull love as Philemon commanded Could never sinke from the soule of Melintus. Cla. Since Melintus hath begun, take my confession too; Know I saw it long agoe and decreed Rewards of friendship for the noble youth, For when 'twas beyond my power to cure, it had Beene crueltie to have inquir'd the paine, and therefore Would not see what I pittied, and now You have all the secrets of my heart, those of joy This friendship multiplies, and those of griefe Thus thou divid'st thy paineâ Enter Olinda. Mel. Oh lay thy whole weight here. Olin. Madam, Selucus upon earnest businesse, As he pretends, will see you. Enter Selucus. Cla. How! will see me, tell himâ Sel. Nothing, he knowes too much Madam, Tho when my anger, which envie and your cause Begot, was growne to such a destructive height That I could not rule it, till it had found My owne ruine in your frowne, yet a Souldiers Envie is no sin, nor ought his anger Be punish'd by his friends, when he appeares Not in love with his fault, nor seekes to justifie it. This day I beg leave to crave your pardon For my offence, you refus'd my visit, and made An excuse to admit this; Madam 'twill be no glory To you, that you could withstand these seiges, which Silvander and my selfe I aid against you By many services when it shall be knowne You were o'recomaby a single one, and yeelded At first sight. Cla. Selucus when I take you for my friend Ile Take your counsel, and not till then for the Services you urge they have beene alwayes drest So in commands that they appear'd unbecomming. Sel. Madam, you did not looke with equall eyes Vpon them, else their passion would have appeard Their greatest beauty, and I never spoke Loves language more then when I was least a Poet. Cla. The love of Subjects is the reward of duty, And those whom we pay we doe not thanke; The hireling ought to serve. Sel. Madam, you speake as if I serv'd for bread, And forget that Subjects are heavens servants, And 'tis the gods that appoint us Kings, and I Am doom'd to it, not want that makes me weare The livery of subject, which you are not exempt from; But I wonder what mighty Prince this is That thus vouchsafes to hide himselfe. Cla. This is insolence here. Mel. Your pardon Madam tis my Q. your Sex cannot strike. And 'twas the respect which this place claimes made me Stand thus long his marke, now to you who this Second time with scorne lookes upon my temper, When a calme has bid it, know in the best Of all thy ill acts thy love, thou art a slave That durst hope this Princesse would be food for servants; And tho thy fawning on thy masters feet Have beene cherish'd so that thou hast left Their crummes there, and art now set by him Snatching at his owne dish. Sel. This to me. Mel. Yes to thee, which hast now begun thy lap Which I prophesie will end at his throate, Nor are such dogs strange in this state, remember Yesterday when one of that hated breed Fell unpittied. Sel Sure you doe take me for a coward, you durst not Vrge me thus else. Mel. No Sir that would secure you, nor doe I beleeve Tho you have many faults, coward any of them. Sel. Ile waite you in the garden. Exit. Mel. Ile follow youâ Madam let not this threatned storme fright you, Your interest lies in the securitie Of my innocence which cannot fall here, Cla. Oh that Melintus would heare my reasons For what I say, e're accuse me for having Too much woman in my suite, and then I would tell him he must not fight, at least not now. Mel. Not fight? my honour is concern'd. Cla. And my honour is concern'd 'twill looke like Fighting for me, I hope Melintus will not Set that at stake against opinion, especially When his courage is so farre from being a question It is become a Proverbe, besides tho yee conquer Yee are lost, you see his interest in my father Makes him not looke with justice on your merits, And to kill his creature may threaten your owne ruine But these arguments have their period in feares still, And therefore Ile not urge the reasons they bring As of force against the danger that honour threatens. Mel. And those that come not so attended are commands To Melintus who covets onely to keepe his beauties That you may not be put to make excuses for your love. Cla. Then gently thus let me prevaile with you To appoint a further day to determine this angry question, Whilst I acquaint my father with his ambitious hopes Which he not dreames are levell'd at me, and Consequently the Crowne, Ile tell him of His insolence here, and at that battaile, then urge The late treason and bid him call to minde The dangers that Traytors hopes threaten Which sprung from this roote, I know 'twill startle His soule, and if it faile, to ruine him, Yet 'twill take the edge o'the Kings faith off From what he sayes, and with Iealous eyes will Looke upon his growing greatnesse, and when He is thus shooke, thus parted from the Cedar That shelters him, then let thy justice power A storme upon his head, and now by the powre Melintus hath given me, I command him deliver His honour for a time into my protection; This (if I have not appeard too carelesse Of mine owne) you cannot deny me. Mel. You have o'recome me, take my honour, which I have preserv'd through thousand hazzards I freely give it to you, and now rest Secure, I am yours for ever, for my love And honour being gone, what rests it fit for now, I will not meete this angry man, his insolence Shall have justice on her sides and I will give Him cause to scorne me. Cla. Melintus shootes his presents, and then they wound, Not oblige, courtesies done unwillingly Is throwing the frozen into the fire, where Too much heate kills the charitie, and proves But altering, not rescuing the danger. Mel. Pardon deerest if you finde me unvers'd In the way that leades to dishonour, for tho I submit to your reason, yet Selucus Nor the world to whom he will barely tell The thought will not know what argument With-held me. Cla. Pray obey me without dispute And I hope this clowd is all that is left Of many that lowr'd upon our ioyes, and we Shall see a cleare evening yet to crowne our wishes fare well Exit. Enter Selucus. Sel. Hence love, and thy pale dew be gone, Revenge and her beautious purple, 'tis to thee I bow Love cannot now reach my ends, tho at first I stalk'd with it, 'twas indeede a proper nurse And rock'd the cradle, whil'st my designes were young, But now they walke alone, waited on by resolutions And confident of their strength: I neede not thy sucke Nor milky miracles to confirme my faith Nor ought they meant tho ill be layd to me For to dare, speakes the great soule, not the successe, For Prophets well seene in things to come Have bin themselves o'retaken with an unknown doom But stay, the businesse now in hand requires My being present hereâ'are something slow Enter Melintus. In justifying, tho quicke in doing injuries, Sure you beleeve me, the dog you cal'd me; You would not have made me waite thus else. Mel. 'Tis true, injuries are things I am slow To justifie as commit, they are commonly The children of choller, and such bastard issue Shames the parents, and if through weakenesse At any time I get them, I hide them If I can with satisfaction. Sel. Words are too neere a kin to heale words, your sword. Hath a more certaine cure; and I repaire to that, Draw; doe yee not understand the word? draw. Mel. First heare me, that I came uninvited And now am going without taking leave, Shewes 'twas choise put me upon these hazards Not necessitie, and that I dare fight I have it written in my face, here under My enemies hand to witnesse, and such torne ensignes Till the bearer fled no dangers let that satisfie 'Tis not feare bindes my hands, &amp; yet I will not fight. Sel. 'Twas the cause I see gave you fire, and I Am asham'd to call that man enemy, which I must Twice bid draw his sword, which doe, or Ile kill thee. Mel. I will not fight. Sel. You will not fight, by my life Ile kill thee then. Mel. When I will not fight any one may doe it, But when I will you cannot, and once agen I tell thee I will not fight, nor dar'st thou kill me. Sel. Not dare! Why what hast thou about thee that Can protect thee from the justice that this brings. Mel. Thou hast about thee that protects me, and the I hate thee, yet I can be just. Sel. Doe me justice and not speake it, and if that she Be in thy power, draw her sword, 'tis her proper Embleme, or by my anger thou art lost, nor shall This neare kinde of Coward save thee, turne and doe not Tempt me, turne I say, or by him that rules The day Ile kill thy fame too, with a cowards wound in thy backe. Mel. Thou dar'st not doe it, I know thou wilt not Take so little for thy honour, it cost thee too deare To be sold so cheape, to take a naked life That's undefended fort, thou seest I am Resolv'd not to fight to day, so bound by resolution That coward could not loose it, therefore in vaine Thou temptst me. Sel. Why the devill did you take this resolution Against me that long to fight with thee. Mel. 'Tis but for a time, Sel. Will you then hereafter. Mel. Yes by all my hopes, and nothing but this Resolution then in thee shall protect one of us Sel. Till this fit be over then, Ile leave you. Exit. Mel. 'Tis strange having both one businesse, our way Should lye so severall, Claracilla thy commands Can put me into any forme that can bow me thus. Exit. Enter Carillus.

Yes my Lord and he had newly parted With the King, hee's this morning to make his visit To the Princesse, your Lordship is appointed by the King To accompany him. Sel. You saw not Olinda since. Car. No my Lord. Sel. Goe finde her, and tell her of this visit, Bid her single her selfe from the company Tell her I must speake with her this morning, Exit Carillus. Claracilla will thinke me very bold To dare thus soone to presse into her presence, But no matter, her thoughts have now no power To punish me that have set my selfe free: Nor will I agen stand in awe of ought But what power that does create the cause As well as beget the feare, that power that made Fate faile, and yet his servant; there I will Pay all I have for feare, here to tremble Is to feare the Idoll I my selfe have made.

It had a name, and 'twas cal'd a secret whilst But by two knowne, and Claracillas secret But it shall become a generall knowledge I over-heard it when she gave it to the Prince, And by this name, the onely secret of my heart; Shee's in love, and by honour engag'd, does that move you? When you know to whom, your love will sacrifice her To your anger, 'tis the stranger, and but that Her bashfulnesse could not name him aloud I now might have told you who was, for She nam'd him, and this night he is to meete Her in the garden, the Prince is there too And none but I faithfull to Selucus, Now doe I rave or no.

Ap. Against impious men this Sanctuary is no guard Else the reserv'd modesty with the priviledge Of birth and beautie that waite upon the Princesse Might have defended her against your sawcy flames Which too late have aym'd at the top of thy Masters house, But that injury was not so great as this That thou durst thinke thy poyson would not breake Her Christall, but with this injurious hope beleeve She should conceale thy insolence, which Ile spread.

King Can you prove this. Sel. Can I prove it, yes Sir I can prove it, But Iealousie is a weede, whose root lies so many wayes That if once it take growth it is hardly digged out, And this sad truth of once suspected, and never confident Is falne upon me, else what I shall say Would finde a faith with you, but I desire not To have my word now cleare me, take but my counsell And I shall give you your owne satisfaction: Seeme still to frowne on me, and require Not the Princesse company this night in the Court, The rest Sir in your careâwill this confirme They whisper.

Oh heavens, why doe you thus load a youth I was not proud when I was bow'd to, nor Ever with repinings did I bow to you, Why then on my free borne soule doe you lay The load of slavery, and thus let your justice Sleepe that she does not now guide my prayers But suffers them to lose their way 'twixt heaven And my sufferings, which I have beene so long acquainted with That I am now growne a kinne unto my woes Allyd unto my oare, where I have set Forc'd to unwilling hast, sighing for my freedome Till through a thousand eyes I have sweating wept My miseries, Oh looke downe in time upon them E're I yeeld to those irreligious thoughts That tempt me to question my beleefe; For yee cannot blame me if I grow weary Of praying when I finde that mighty power That threw me here; want mercy to breake the snare.

Let us not lose a minute of this pretious time then 'Twill be a reward for thy faith too, when they shall say Timillus had a hand in this great worke, Prethee let thy friendship secure the passage That leades from the Kings lodgings. Tim. So now have I an honorable excuse to take cold wish, 'tis a strange bold venture he makes, and a confident vertue that of hers, that dares trust themselves in the hands of my opinion, when I am alone, to guesse how they meane to employ this opportunitie, Mel. Gentle soule. 'tis not the feare of my particular That makes me urge this sad parting, but your interest Which is joyn'd to it, and when you are concern'd 'Tis a civilitie to feare, and an obligation to doubt My joyes, for Claracilla knowes despaire Is no sinne in loves religion. Cla. Let me not understand thee, nor let not reason Binde up what you urge; Oh Melintus 'Tis the first time that ever I was griev'd To heare thee in the right, and you must pardon it, For tho parting be the onely way to Confirme my joy, I cannot consent at such a rate To buy my happinesse. Mel. Thus you encrease the wish'd number of my bonds The Prince untill my returne will observe all Your commands, and assist us in our escape And by his favour countenance the act For Mecena, if my father commanded therein chiefe I could not hope a greater power then I Am confident Pelius will allow your worth And e're this Moone hath felt her change, I will Agen attend you with the Gallies. Cla. Must you then be gone, and agen with absence Spinne our loves into a thread which is fastned to our fates, I hope that no distance may finde the end, Say must you goe, must it needes be so. Mel. I would there were not such a strict necessitie But that I might say no. Cla. Well since it must be resolv'd but not contented I submit unto my fate, and thou Lawrell tree, Which so oft hast beene a witnesse of our sad parting If within thy backe the angry god hath With the trembling virgin any of his passion hid Thou know'st what paine they feele, that with longing love Follow their flying joyes, and see, looke Melintus Casting my eye by chance I have spyed one of The witnesses of our infant love, doe you remember When we changed our Characters, and with them printed Our faith on the yeelding barke, 'twas then but a small scratch We gave, but now like our miseries by time encreas'd 'Tis in her tender side to a large wound growne. Mel. Why should we not for ever grow thus, why should the gods With thunder part what themselves have joyn'd, We that have knowne but one wish, and to each others thoughts Have parents beene, why should we not thus gazing sit And tie with kinde smiles soft fetters for the eye? But this cannot be, and therefore heare me pronounce My owne doome, farewell, but e're I obey This sad necessitie, let me on your faire hand Print my faith, and with holy vowes binde my selfe to thee. Cla Oh hold, give me no contract gentle Melintus, no Ties but love, these are bonds I scorne to throw On such who from mine eyes can goe. Enter King, Selucus, Carillus and Attendants. Sel. Have I perform'd or no? King. Yes, Claracilla this Act when the story shall be written Will not appeare so kind unto the rest That have had honour and duty still their guide And not thus led astray by passion. Cla. Sir I must not be beare from my strength here Tho you frowne, a fault I confesse but dishonour Has no share in't. King. Sir you came a friend and you are a stranger Nor will I whilst I labour to punish commit a fault By being ungratefull, or breake the lawes of Hospitalitie by laying hands upon you, Onely thus much the injuries you have done me And the Prince bids me tell you, if to morrowes sunne Set upon you within my court, his shades Will bring thine upon thee. Exit King, Cla. Atten. Sel. Revenge thar't prosperous, and in my anger This is lost, craft, be thou as friendly to My designes upon that shallow Prince, and I Alone stand faire for Claracilla, Ile watch How it workes, oh how heel'e fume anon. Mel. The wound that amazement gives strikes all our sences, And like lightning destroyes without a breach: But yet I see some foode for my revenge, And whilst that fuell lasts, this flame shall not Perish Selucus come backe, and let your friend stay. Sel. Carillus stay, your fit is off then I perceive And you can be angry upon your owne score And fight when women are not by. Mel. Yes thou shalt finde I can fond man, and the Flame that thou hast kindled in my brest I Will husband so that it shall consume thee, And neither hold it so high to loose it In my choller nor so low as to let patience Tread it out. Sel. Spare your threats, your words wound not, when I refuse To fight upon a strange resolution Then rand or rayle, and Ile excuse it. Mel. No I am no rayler, I could wish thee rather A more glorious enemy one whose name scandall Of no kinde had ever lighted, by my life I wish it, and that thou wert cleare from this Base act, whose weight has sunke all the honour That swam in thy blood, and I am asham'd To thinke this necessitie freeth me To offer one so lame in honour, and in passion Blinde to the power I worship, for the imperfect Are not fit for sacrifice. Sel. I hope you have none of these faults, but will become An Altar, leade the way, and you shall finde Selucus dares follow without being pul'd to slaughter Mel. Vnder the woods side that borders on the haven Will be a fit place, 'tis neare the towne, and I beleeve in the night free from company. Sel. There Ile meete you then. Tim.

Slave, and ungratefull, thou shalt finde thou hast Too soone mention'd thy freedome, foole, onely free In hope, and this act hath but increast thy load Of chaines, curse thy selfe, for thy increase Of miseries shall make thee finde th'art more A slave then ever. Phi. Doe not deceive thy selfe, looke there, and here, He points to his chaines and shewes his dagger. And ere thou art toss'd in thy anger, here this truth I speake; he that is master of this and will Become a slave, must be a coward too. And now I am arm'd I scorne to owe my freedome To any but the gods. Man. Death, dogge, dost thou brave me with my curtesie? Draw Tullius my thirstie rage will be quench'd They both draw and runne at Phil. With nothing but the slaves blood. Mel. Heaven for ought I know We are by thy direction thus cast two to two, If not Ime sure by honour we are, He runs in betweene them, and gives Phi. a sword. Here take this sword. Phi. Now Tullius thou shalt see how mortall thy Power is, which so like a god thou wearst amongst thy Slaves, revenge and freedome guides me to thy ruine. And you sir, strike to prevent the losse of such An opportunitie, a vow forbids me To tell you who I am: now the wound that thou Basely gavest me, when I was bound and naked.

Phi. leaves Tullius and runs to Mel and parts them Man. Nay then ile smiling fal, now I have my revenge For I see thou wert borne to be a slave, and all Thy parts of honour, were but distempers in thee And now thy nature is strong, thou appearst thy selfe, A slave in thy soule, come what stayes thee, I have A brest so cleere, it defies thy poniard, traytor. Phi. No, I was borne free, and Manlius his rage Once over, he will say he hath injur'd me, And sir, as I drew my sword against my master When honour bad me, so when you shall seeke To make me faulty I am your enemie, And therefore attempt no farther this mans Danger, it is not safe. Man. My wonder waites upon all this fellowes acts. Mel. What art thou that thus in lesse than a man Hides more than a god. Phil. What am I? a soule with her old cloathes on. A slave with wounds and crosses stor'd, and yet in better Fortunes I have knowne your face. Mel. If thou hast mercy in thee, tel me whom thou art. Phi. Marke me well, dost thou not see thy selfe here. Not yetânow I am sure thou dost in these Christall drops: friendship will guide Melintus To know Philemon. Mel. Philemon! O ye gods new waightes to sinke me. Phil. Oh tis a powerfull rod that Melintus Friendship strikes with, a thousand miseries Have smote upon this rocke, but never any That made water issue through till now. Mel. Oh Philemon, Philemon, what cannot friendship do Tis from her living springs this dew fall. Man. Melintus and Philemon, good heaven what change Hath begot this misery, oh noble Princes Vpon my knee I beg when your sad joyes Are over, youle shower a pardon upon Vnfortunate Manlius. Mel. Manlius? is this Manlius, he was Claracillas friend. Phi. Tis Manlius, and I hope a faire day will Breake from a bloody evening. Mel. Your pardon sir, or here upon my brest Returne the wounds my rage directed against yours. Man. Repeate it not sir, you make me but call to Minde my shame, which I must ever blushing weare When I remember a slave could looke further Into honour than I. Phi. Oh Melintus I have a story for thee That we shall weepe out together. Mel. When I looke upon thee I am distracted To thinke the gods would consent thus to let Their Temples be ruin'd and vertue alwayes walke Noked, like truthes Emblem, whilst better fates Cloath the wicked. Phi. Deere Melintus let not the sense of my Misfortunes urge a consideration from thee At the rate of sinne, and dare those powers Which I know thou fearst. Mel. I have done noble youth, yet when I looke Vpon thee, joy and amazement will seize Vpon me, I have strange things to tell thee: But this nor time nor place, who is this That thus unfortunately met thy anger. Man. A stout and gratefull fellow, twas the Captaine That sav'd me, when I was doom'd by Silvander Mel. A stirres, heaven I hope Will not let the guilt of one accidentall fault, Hange upon this evening to crosse our joyes. Phi. I am sorry since there dwelt such honour in him That he prov'd my enemy; this was the Pirat Tooke me at Rhodes. Man. Pray helpe him aboard my gally, where we may All repose, and till to morrow resolve What is to be done, in the new change of Sicilie. Phi.

I have done, passion can be a friend No more she's so unconstant, give her way And she destroyes her selfe, if I had beene So fortunate to have spoke with you last night I had prevented this sad chance, for I knew Melintus anger would take a dangerous leape When by amazement he had contracted it. Ap. If I could have fear'd such danger, I should not Have beene so absent with the remedie, But I am not satisfied how it was discover'd By the King, yet if Civility had not prevented me Ere now I had spoke my feares and long since sayd Beware of Olinda. Cla. Olinda! she betray me?

Ra. I am but one, and Ile not say I shall be Fortunate, but I am certaine I will attempt Any thing that may speake my gratitude. Man. Give me leave to breake this discourse, &amp; since You are pleas'd to trust me with this service, let me not Lose time, but whilst this expectation's in the Court Let me see whether I can walke unseene or no; And since Selucus danger was onely losse of blood They will be more intent about him than if He had falne; Ile be gone, the day growes old In the garden you say tis likely I shall finde her; The Prince is a young man.

We that have together borne our miseries And with a harsh fate, worne out our weary dayes, Have not amongst them all, met one that will Lye so heavie on our feares, as this base act, If we assist the Traytor. Ra. Sir be free, and let honour only draw your sword. Ravack releases Appius, they draw. Sel. Kill that Traytor slave. As Selucus attempts, Melintus seizes him and sets a dagger to his breast. Mel. Free the King, foole canst thou yet reade the Miseries thy hated life shall feele, if not, here Melintus tells thee what they are Melintus puls off his beard and discovers himselfe. Sel. Melintus! Mel. Whilst Philemon and Manlius triumph in the Victory that having loyalty has gain'd over Thy insulting treacheriesâsir to you I kneele For pardon, for thus venturing to threaten Dangers, all else are acquainted with the plot We layd to discover to your abused trust This wretched monster. Ravack seizes Selucus. Cla. The Prince sir was of Counsell in all we did. Mel. And we have his consent sir to be happie. King. Of all I aske a pardon whom my doubt Has injur'd, and Ile no longer crosse your joyes: You have my consent, and heaven crown your wishes But for thee thy villanie shall destroy thee. Sel. Madam to your vertues, which my mischiefes still Have hunted, thus low I bow, and when I With repentant teares have washed the way, let My last breath finde your faith, that I lov'd, the Rate I would have payd speakes how much, and since From him I derive these miseries, by his power Which you have bow'd to I begge and conjure Your mercy, that it may in pardon finde me; And then with a wound here Ile give balme to Those under which my honour now languishes. King. Disarme him. He drawes a dagger. Sel. Attempt it not. He stabbes himselfe. Cla. Hold I forgive. Sel. Can you forgive, oh this mercy Has chang'd my opinion, I thought nothing could Have made Claracilla more like an Angell; But this mercy has added to all thy beauties A heavenly forme, and one wound to those that Iustice threaten, and thy faire soule, tis fit I offer my selfe though none be more unfit For sacrifice, and whilst my faults expire In the blood that bred them, from heaven onely Shall Selucus beg a pitty, my hate dwell With all the rest; oh turne not but looke upon The ruine you have made, and whilst I thus Gazing dye, witnesse my heaven which is Claracilla I fall to love and scorne a Martyr. Dyes. King. Whilst Iustice is striking let me lift a hand here Melintus this I hope will cure all the Wounds my unkindnesse gave thee, and now to Court That when thou hast these bonds put off Hymen may New fetters bring. Mel. Sir your pardon, if I Say I must not change this habit till my joyes Are full, and by another bond freed, this disguise Hath beene so fortunate that I dare not quit it Whilst tis possible to misse my wishes. King. Take your pleasure, Phi. Oh Madam you have heard a story which Makes me blush to looke upon you. Cla. Philemon must not be troubled now when Our joyes are thus compleate, but live in smiles To recount our miseries. King. The story how, we came to be thus happie Weele reserve to crowne our feast with, and Manlius Thy part in the successe of this day shall not Be forgotten, to the boate, and then to the Temple, And let the Priests sing an Epithalamium to these lovers praise, Whose faiths have turn'd their chaines to Myrtle and triumphant bayes. Exeunt. As they goe off singing over the Stage. Enter Timillus above with a Rope to come downe and make his escape, heares them sing, understands by the song that it is all joy and peace; and when they are gone he speakes. Tim. Nay if the winde be in that corner, Ile leape No leapes but this, With a health, the prayers of the Layitie, Give thankes for our delivery. FJNJS.</field>
