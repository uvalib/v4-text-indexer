      <field name="fulltext">A Trage-comicall Historie often tymes acted wth approbation At the Red Bull in St: Johns Streete By the Company of ye Reuells Act. i. Sce. 1. Alarm, then Flourish and [Sh] Shout within. Enter Iustina flying, Doron wounded meets her. Iustina. O spare my life, seeke not a virgins bloud. Doron. O fly faire Lady, [co]flie the respectlesse sword of this blood-stayn'd Ãgyptian. Iustina. If my life must need be forfited, [t]yet make my death lesse fearfull by the mercie of a stroke that with a suddain speed may make me earth. Doron. Collect your selfe deare Lady: violent feare does much abuse you, you mistake your sight. Iustina speakes not to an Egyptian proudly pursuing conquest and his pray. But to a Syrian, and your countreyman of Antioch; distressed Antioch that now is nothing but a flaming fier. One rage consumes my countrey and your court. The king is slayne; and braue Lysymachus his valiant brother, and your princely father is fall'n with him: so are my nearest frends. each crie wee heare sends eccho's to our eares of kinsmens gastly groanes, about vs fier consumes the ancient honours of our land. Iustina. I did mistake thee frend: but thy report of my deare fathers [death] fall, has chang'd my minde from wishing life, to welcom fatall death. send me some fierce Egyptian thirsting bloud, that he may send mee to my fathers rest: that foe shall be my frend, and while I fall Ile blesse the weapon that I die withall. Doron. How fruitfull is fowle Mischeife! one ill fate begets another quickly. princely maide, you are the all that's left [of] o th'royall race of Antioch, then doe not darken quite her glimpse of glorie, many yeares agoe you know the kings young sonne was made away, and you are now next in succession. liue then a while a sparke of princely fier rak'd vp in embers and conceald from sight. Time may from you draw forth a [y] princely race that may restore the state of Antioch. Iustina. what hope of honour, or what ioy of life [that] can frendlesse sorrows giue mee? no, let death [shorten] prevent my future miseries. Doron. Alas, the wretched call for death, but when he comes the strongest sorrow cannot brooke his lookes. Lady, I Doron am that serv'd the king, and for his sake receiv'd these wounds in fight. I know not why I should escape with life vnlesse [it weare to rescue you from] to saue Iustina from foule death. And sure 'tis heau'ns decree, then put not by such mercie offer'd, lest you greiue the saints. Iustina. Indeed I am a Christian, and must learne not to despaire. but where's the way of life? Doron. [I the road hard by, there lies a gall] Wee'l flie to Babilon, and there vnknown liue [till our] in obscuritie till clearer starres shine our fortunes. Shout within harcke I heare at hand the bloody foe fiercely pursues his chace. ty vp our tongus and let our feet finde wings. Iustina. O fickle change ally'd to mortal things! Exeunt. Sce. 2. Alarm still. Crie within, Kill Kill Kill. Enter Barebones (a poore Scholler) running. Barebones. Alas, Alas; These Gypseys tell vs our fortune the worst way, and threaten our throats cutting. All the Cittie of Antioch is become a bonefire: theres nothing but cutting and killing, and neuer a constable to part the fray. 'tis time for mee to runne and I could tell whither: pray heau'n I haue not lost some of my limbs in running away. Let mee see, how many wings has a goose? I should haue so many armes if I durst stay to tell them; and my leggs too:[,] I doubt for haste, I haue left one of them behinde me at the cobblers pulling on a new soald shoo. within, Kill Kill Kill. What againe? good Gypseys, if there be any mercie in you, let mee liue as I am, Bare-Bones. Much studdy (though to little purpose) has stoll'n away so much of my flesh, that my bones are not worth the picking. within, Kill Kill Kill. Alas, more yet? Ile runne into my masters studdy, and hide mee in his inckehorne. O Mr. Mr. Mr. Ciprian discovered at his booke. Cyprian. How now? what's the buisnes? Â«BÂ»arebones. O absurditie to a scholler! aske the buisnes when it beats his eares into a fearfull deafnes! why the cittie is taken, houses fier'd, folkes kill'd, men grouell on their bellys, while women are layd on their backes; and I the poorest puppie that is left, liue but to bawle out my owne feares sensibly, while you sit senslesse. Cyprian. Peace[,] fearfull coward; know'st thou [[illeg.]] not my arte can tame the dreadfull'st danger, and surprize the proud surprizer. Barebones. I know you can coniure; and you know that Gypseys can iuggle too. Now if they should iuggle away your coniuring sticke, where are we then? Therfore Ile hide mee ouer head and eares among your bookes for there lies moste of your arte. Shout within. Alas, they come. sweet learning shelter mee now, and let vs die frends that haue all our life been mortall enimies. Hides him vnder the table. Enter Lysander and Miranda with they swords drawne. Lysander. Come bould Miranda, wonder of thy sex; Now w'haue got towring conquest by the wing let's plucke her nak'd, and with her golden feathers plume our victorious helmes. Miranda. Make Antioch our despis'd slaue, while through her wayling streets wee dragge her citizens. But what dull coward is this, that while the cittie flames about him sits poaring on a booke? [Fol. 2 is missing.] Souldan. Well then, by vs is Nicomedia wonne, High towr'd Damasco, and this Antioch; and those that weare too proud to feare our furie are humbled by our anger, and their liues made yeild to death that scorn'd to yeild to vs. Miranda. May thy foes still be humbled to thy foote, and the great Souldan to the bounds of Nile bynde all the nations in a captive chayne, till Rome that now rules vs give place [and] to you [command the world] in the fift Monarchy to rule the world. Souldan. Miranda, thy celestiall lips haue spoke a blessing on thy father, which I take religiously, as from an oracle. Princes and captaines, now to make it known the Souldan more regards [the] a victors name then spoyles of warre, we giue this citties spoile amongst the souldiers, houlding it greater honour t'inrich our subiects then to make them poore. Who suckes the lab'rers sweat from his toyld bosom draws with't the sickly milke of discontent, which feebles those firme honours fortune sent. Miranda. But as the base of honour must be firm'd in bounty to the lowest; so the pillars on which the tow'r of greatnesse is borne vp by the same right must haue fit guerdon left t'encourage, and confirme their loyalties: These peers deserve as well as private men by whose co?aund, and counsell you haue sack'd Antioch the eie of Syria. Souldan. Glorious girle, high honour of the greate Egyptian line, Pallas in prowesse and true iudging counsell: first I admire, then follow thy advice. Lysander our Leiftenant generall to thee wee giue the land of Antioch gouerne it vnder vs. be thou Colactus Leiftenant of Damasco. But for thee kingdomes are poore rewards; thou must haue better for with thy sword the world will conquer'd bee; and with thine eies the Conqueror of the world. Lysander. (asside.) These are a louers, not a fathers words. Miranda. What meanes my father by these prayse-full tearmes. Souldan. When I my rare Miranda looke on thee, Wonder of [Nature] beautie, wit, and haughty courage! Mee thinckes, but wonder, nothing can reward thee. Nature made thee so rich, fortune so greate that but a greatnesse greater then them both I may not offer thee, nor thou receive. Miranda. A fathers loue express'd to his owne childe can beare no name of wonder, and that loue is the full height of all my hope and merrit. Souldan. That Loue A[[illeg.]]pollo vnto Daphne bare that loue the blushing Morne to Memn? faire bequeath'd by earnest of her balmy kisse that loue the Souldan will bestow on thee. Kisses her. Miranda. That loue to Lord Lysander's only due Lysander. (asside.) And who vsurps on that, loues not to liue. Miranda. Great sir, your words are wondrous as your power, What issue has this vnaccustom'd courting? Souldan. This, that th'Egyptian Souldan (being too poore by fortune to reward thy matchlesse merrit) intends to honour thee my liues sole honour wth hymens holy bands, make thee my Queen. Lysander. (asside.) ffirst will I quench those marriage brands in bloud. Miranda. (asside ... ) Mightie amazement meets me, and but I know my fathers disposition; I could hope [this we] this weare not cerious ernest.â( ... asside) Mightie Sir. Is this the wondrous wages of my merrit? speakes highest honour in the tone of shame? Souldan. To bee the Queen of Egypt, is this shame? Miranda. To glorifie with incest, is this honour? Souldan. Thou shalt agree Miranda, we must wed. Miranda. Agree with death, not with a fathers bed. Colactus. Beware faire princesse to displease your father. Miranda. Beware great father to displease the gods. Souldan. [Beware] Hah! Colactus. See hee beares the gods vpon his brows. All thing are lawfull that a prince allows. Lysander. ffalse flattrie makes a foule glosse on the text. And though such purchase fauour from ill men, the good gods store them vengeance. Colactus. Lysander, this is worse th? sacriledge. Lysander. Better Colactus then thy flatterie. Souldan. No more. Though we can pause ere wee take fire, being kindled we consume. who dares oppose vs? Miranda. Our laws oppose you sir. Souldan. why what are laws? Cyprian. Laws, are the fruites of reason, and who giues a penaltie for crimes, must feare to sinne: Souldan. Is there a law for him that ruleth law? Colactus. No, mighty Souldan there's no other law then the decree of your imperiall will. [Miranda]. [Souldan] Tis true, the royall priviledge of Kings ought [to not] not to be eclips'd by co?on laws. Therfore our will shall sway. and we co?aund on payne of death, let no man argue further; but all submit to our determination. Lysander. (asside.) my tongue shall keep his scabberd; but at need [s] my sword shall speake such langage as shall speed. Cyprian. (asside.) I am a [captive,] stranger, and must keep farr of from taking notice of these tyrannies: but ere Lysander shall so loose his loue, my arte shall make the depths of hell to moue. Souldan. Thy modestie Myranda warrs against vs: But thy consent in circle of thyne eie appeares obedient. 'tis wee wills it so. Thy [vestall vows chayn'd] loue to vs linckd in a Hymens knot shall make thee nerer to vs. Lords march on The God of warre has giu'n vs victorie, Wee'l try if Loues God like propitious bee. Exeunt. Sce. 4. Enter [Eumenia] Iustina supporting Doron deadly wounded. Iustina. Rest Doron, rest, and let mee binde thy wounds. Th'assailants all are fled. Doron. ffled for supplys to charge vs fiercer, not for feare of mee. Iustina. Alas what barbrous crueltie is this to iniure strangers that for succour come! Doron. Your beauty is the sinne we both smart for, your honour is the prey they hunt for; I for rescuing that, am thus oppos'd with odds vnanswerable: nerthelesse I vow by my spents spirits and these crimson streames, which hauing left theyr[e] ould veyns in my flesh now seeke new channells in the thirsty earth. while I haue life I will defend your honour. Iustina. O faithfull man! what hazards haste thou runne for me, a great mans daughter, yet so poore as cannot recompence thy loyaltie with more then thanckfull loue. [Then] O Noble Doron, come hide thee in this wood, where I will make a bed of mosse to rest thy mangled [wounds] limbs Ile seeke out plantain and hypericon to heale thy hurts. Then faint not faithfull man. why doest thou change and quake? He falls to the ground. Doron. My masse of bloud is banqu[e]rupt grown; this building is decay'[e]d. My Soule the tenant is turn'd out of dore because he now can pay his [rest] rent no more. Crie within follow, follow this way. O harcke our fierce pursuers are [at] at hand; My sword falls from the weake gripe of myne arme[s], Iustina fly and hide thee in the wood, lest when death makes a prey of this my corps thy body proue a prey that that's worse. Iustina. I cannot leaue thee in this wretched plight, Ile take thy sword [and] and with my weake arme fight. Enter 3. Souldiers. 1. Souldier. [I] This way they went, I tracke him by his bloud. 2. Souldier. This bloudy path shews he cannot flie farre. 3. Souldier. See where he lies, vpon him all at once. Iustina. Hold cruell cowards, spoyle not a dying man. 1. Souldier. what will you fight? wring from her tender fist that vnfit engine. Doron. O I die, farewell. heau'n send thee help. Dies. Iustina. haue you dispatch'd his life? [[illeg.]]let your relentlesse [del] swords enter this brest and giue my life like happie libertie. 2. Souldier. No pretty one, the weapon thou shalt feele shall be of milder temper then rough steele. Iustina. Help ye chaste pow'rs, help heau'n, help Angells, help. Enter Miranda in Mans apparell. Miranda. what mischeife moues this outcrie? barbarous slaues, iniure a lady! quickely set her free; or you shall dearely answer it to mee. 1. Souldier. Answer to you? by what authoritie? Miranda. By vertue of this warrant; this iust sword pow'rfull to plague iniustice. 2. Souldier. That weele trie. They fight, while Iustina kneels by Doron and looks on him. Enter Clitophon, hee parts them. Clitophon. with what advantage (villains) doe you fight? you souldiers, and distayne your honour thus! sease, and discourse the cause of this contention. Iustina. They need not tell thee. see 'tis grauen here in bloody wounds: here lies true honour dead. Clitophon. But from that honours ashes in myne eie rises a PhÃ¦nix full of maiesty. who slew this happlesse stranger? 1. Souldier. Wee my lord. As wee weare standing at the castle gate this lady, and that gentleman came by. wee seing such a faire and courtly maid sought to surprize her: but by him repuls'd we fought till he slew three, and wounded five of our warders, but scaping not himselfe there lies hee dead to satisfie their deaths. Clitophon. what brought you to this battaile, noble sir. Miranda. Pitty and honour; pitty drew myne eare by her loud shreeks, and honour mou'd my hart to draw my sword, and take the weake ones part. Clitophon. Iust was your cause and noble your attempt. But of what countrey are you louely dame? Iustina. Of Antioch, whose desolation made vs redeeme our liues by flying hither but where wee [look'd] sought for succour, we found death, and cruell [iniurie] violence.

Let him that shews thee grace, thy fauour finde, I am not cruell, bee not thou vnkinde. Iustina. what are you? or what loue do you professe if from ignoble birth your selfe or loue first tooke beginning, [then] I will sooner die then [yeild to] to such [foule] motions yeild my virgin eare. Clitophon. [faire Maide] I am the Califfs sonne of Babilon, royall my birth, loyall my loue to thee and breeds no[t] thought to iniure chastitie. Iustina. But prince, I am a Christian; in that name I know you cannot loue mee faithfully. Clitophon. Bee what thou wilt, such sweets sit in thy brow that for thy sake I could turne Christian too. Iustina. To winne a soule to heau'n by yeilding loue may moue [the chastest] a virgin hart that has not vow'd secluded chastitie. therefore [I yeild to you I yeild] my life Into your hands I yeild, and for my loue, let me intreat (till time your faith haue try'd) that may be yet deferr'd that's not deny'd. Clitophon. spoke fairely like thy selfe, and I accept it. Miranda. (asside.) These warrs are like to end with wedding now. Iustina. But princely sir from these [reflex] full beames of grace let mee intreat a kinde reflexion on this dead man, he was of worthy birth [int] burie him nobly then, [and] sir, for my sake. Clitophon. Thyne eies shall witnesse how that pow'rfull word, for thy sake, can co?aund with Clitophon. Bring forth our royall ensigne from the castle, in it fold vp the body of this knight; and with the honours due vnto a prince to Babilon conduct him to his graue. whither for thy sake, faire one, we our selfe will follow, as cheife mourner. worthy sir, will you assist vs in these funeralls? Miranda. I shall attend you[, to] Iustina. To your noble valour I'm much indebted sir. Miranda. I am your servant. Clitophon. Set on. Iustina.

In this disguise Miranda hast thou scap'd the worlds acquaintance, and thy fathers knowledge; That lustfull knowledge, which his too foule heat vow'd to bee master of. The care of honour (I being manlike) chang'd mee thus to man, my name [my] Miranda turn'd to Armidan. And yet I blush to see my selfe thus chang'd: But from Lysanders sight to be estrang'd afflicts mee more. good Gods my fate so guide that I this manhood soone may lay asside. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Sce. 1. Enter Souldan, Lysander, Colactus, Cyprian, 2. Eunuchs, and other attendants. Souldan. Miranda fled! Colactus. In mans disguise, about the dead of night. Souldan. how knewst that, and knewst not how to stay her? Colactus. These Eunuchs that attended on her person report the news. Souldan. Caytives, improvident, dull, sluggish, false, dissembling, traytorous, where is Miranda? 1. Eunuch. ffled great Emperour. Souldan. whither? how? when? doe y'put on staring lookes to cloke a studdyed answer? 2. Eunuch. About that houre when all things are charm'd silent with dead sleep the princesse left the camp and posted hence. Souldan. How knew yee this? 2. Eunuch. At night when bed time came, wee weare dismis'd, only Lycarion her eunuch moste in grace might tend on her: But in the morne, we found Lycarion slayne in her apparell; she not to be found. By which wee guesse she made him change attire in seeming mirth, and then to stop his mouth for blabbing, slew him, and so stole away. Souldan. She flies by night, you seeke her in the morning. She slyly leaues her tent, you sleep secure. Thus haue yee sould my solace by your sloath. Away with them, and first cut out their tongues the harsh relaters of this hated tale. Next plucke their drouzie eies out that durst sleep while shee was waking. then hew them in peeces and set vp their dismembred limbs on poles in eu'ry quarter of the camp. Away. Both Eunuchs. O mercy, mercie, mighty emperour. Souldan. Shall they haue time to liue, to see, and speake? The Guard hurrys them away. Colactus. Your lenity, dread Lord, your matchlesse mildenesse [makes them for] flatters them into these neglects of duty. Souldan. 'Tis true my owne Colactus, I am slow in punishing, which makes offence secure: but my revenge shall quicken, and the flame swifter then lightning shall flie ore the world to finde this false Miranda, whyle the name [of daughter] of daughter's buried in our deep displeasure. Her beauty, and our high esteeme of it makes her grow proud and carelesse of his loue that must co?aund the world. so should high Ioue come downe and court her, she would slight his suite, only because such greatenesse doates vpon her. But by his thunder I'l confound her for't. send out to euery region nere adioyning swift scouts, and subtle spies to finde her out. meane time to giue the furnace of our wrath some vent, our selfe will lead our mighty hoste with irefull terror to proud Babilon. The Califfe at the [news] sight of vs shall quake, and women suffer for Miranda's sake. Colactus. Gratious and iust, so handle your offenders, and they will feare to crosse or iniure you. [Lysander]. (asside to Cyprian.) O Syren, o lust-daubing flatterie. [Cyprian]. (asside to Lysander.) Such fauning is best food for [flatt] tyranny. Souldan. All ground wheron in flight her foot hath trod shall bee made [bee made] barren by ore flowing bloud; ffor with her flight, flies all our loue and mercie. Deep learned Cyprian, valiant Lysander. assist vs with your counsells, help t'invent some new vnheard of death t'inflict on her that thus afflicteth vs. Cyprian. Dread soveraigne, Wise men must calme and not encourage wrath. Souldan. She merrits death. Lysander. She did but saue her honour. Souldan. If thou wilt saue thy head, deffend her not. Lysander. Then I will pray the heau'ns to deffend her. Souldan. Dares any wish prosperitie to one that to our will dares shew rebellion? Lysander. I am a souldier sworn to mayntayn right. Souldan. Hee lies that calls that right that likes not vs. Colactus. Shall subiects limit righteousnesse in Kings? My Lord Lysander, you haue mou'd his highnesse. Bee wise and humor him; see in his brow a storme is threaten'd. Lysander. Shelter your selfe good Sir. Trueth seeks no corners, Ile keep in the playne; honesty needs no cloke to scape the rayne. Cyprian. (asside to Lysander.) Resolue so still [good] Lysander, I will backe thy righteous courage. Colactus. (asside to the Souldan.) I doubt dread sir Lysander has a hand [in] in faire Miranda's scape: for she was once promis'd him by your highnesse, and you see hee dares contest with you in her behalfe. Souldan. (asside to Colactus.) Thou prompst me right Colactus, sure he was her counsell, and contriver of her flight, and (weare he soundly sifted) can reveale [w]her[e] gests, and place of residence. [L] Colactus. (asside.) Lysander, now shall I [power] fling the scornes you cast on me in your owne face. Souldan. Lysander you stand by, and witnesse our displeasure at the flight of false Miranda; yet you will not tell vs wch way she's gone. Lysander. [I hope your Maiestie] Great Sir, would I did know[,]: not to reveale it, but to visit her[:]. It is my burden that she made so light of my true faith, as not to trust me with a plot so noble, and so much concerning [her] her owne [sweet] safety. Souldan. abusive impudence! while hee denys the art of treacherie he yeilds him selfe a traytor in desire. Lay hands on him: [weare] by heau'n Ile haue his head. Cyprian. By heau'n and hell you shall not. The guard stands fixed, their eys rowling from the King to Cyprian, and so too &amp; fro beats them. Souldan. yee dull slaues. why doe you stand amaz'd? must I awake you? Cyprian. They cannot stirre, you weare best bid Colactus. Souldan. what are you iuggling? though thy traytrous [arte] skill in hellish charmes haue thus benumb'd our guard, yet wee'r aboue thy spells, and ere hee fall with our owne hands [you] wee[ll] will dissolue your charme and life together. He stands fixed in a posture of running at him with his sword. Cyprian. Ha ha ha ha. Now Souldan, if thy picture should be drawne It would expresse fierce Aiax in his fury fighting with his owne shaddow. Colactus. help yee gods. Lysander. What is braue fflattery turn'd a coward now? Cyprian. [Now] Shew me one master peece of [policie] flatterie [to fflatter] now to divert my charme that's falling on thee. Colactus. O, mercy Cyprian. Kneeles with a fearfull countenance and so is fixed. Cyprian. Yes: now claw the Souldan, tell him how gloriously these lookes become him. Lysander. ffaith princely to this fooles face. hast no plot[,]? No tricke of witty mischief to set free thy charmed body? is it possible that such a noddle should be made an asse! ha ha ha ha.

Souldan. Hum. Alas. beg you of vs? wee must learne to intreat pardon and fauour from you, that can force the operations of our faculties [to against their] into vnnaturall obstructions. we dare not but forgiue you. let this man be what he was, and wee'l learne to be pleas'd. Cyprian. Enioy your wish in him, and all the rest. Souldan. O my Colactus, art thy selfe againe? Colactus. I thincke I am. Souldan. Thou arte. how weare we lost to all but our owne sense, [wee] I could both heare and see, and feele; but could not moue a ioynt. [Colactus.] nor speake a sound. Colactus. 'Twas so with mee great sir. Guard. And so with vs we could not moue at all but see, and heare, and felt your angrie blows, which we [still] now groane for. Souldan. Ile see to your safetys. [Valiant] Noble Lysander, and good Cyprian, we dare not say we banish you our presence; but we intreat you leaue vs, and the camp; but be not out of call when we shall need you, and yet returne not till we send for you. Cyprian. With all our harts wee goe. Lysander. And leaue be hinde false flatterie to feed a bloody minde. Exeunt Cyprian and Lysander. Souldan. Wee brooke not our superiors; nor will yeild them way to take our adversarys part. let them be closely watch'd they doe not start further then we can reach them at our need. Come they are gone Colactus; recollect thy selfe againe. Colactus. O my dread soueraigne. when you are aw'd, how can I choose but feare? Lysander for Miranda's loue hates vs, And Cyprian for Lysanders sake opposes hell and his arte against vs. Souldan. 'Tis most true. But wee'l revenge it on Miranda's head. Advance our ensignes, March to Babilon: and be't proclaim'd that who ere findes Miranda disguise, and mangle her enticing face, seare vp her tempting breasts, teare wide her mouth, and slit her nose, that thus defac'd, my hate neither by loue nor pitty may abate. fflourish: Exeunt. Sce. 2. Enter Barebones with a satchell of meate, and a bottle of Wine. Barebones. Thancks my good starres, and these kinde warres that haue so sweetly captiv'd vs to the Souldan. Before in Antioch I eate not a good meale in a month; now I victuall it here in the campe to the full. [Thancks to my] If I had known I should haue fared so well, I would haue saved them the labour of taking mee, and haue yeilded my selfe into their hands. Hee sits down. well: My Master has sent mee to con my lesson by my selfe; let me see, what booke comes first to hand? O, this is Ovids Metamorphosis turn'd into pasty crust with the tale of Acteon it, very good venison, I can assure you. [And] here's a couple of our owne country authors Mr. Beefe and Mr. Mutton, these are physicke bookes they haue excellent cordiall receits in them to [keepe] cure hunger, and keep the body in health. and here's a dictionarie that is very helpfull in construing the other authours. I hope I shall proue a good scholler; for you see I ply my booke close. And now I haue construed my lecturÂ«eÂ» Ile begin to pierce it to. Drincks. Enter Sinew, a Souldier. Sinew. O honest [Master] Barebones. I haue sought you with swincking and sweaÂ«tingÂ» Barebones. And honest Sinew thou hast found mee drincking and eating. you souldiers are such smell feasts, youle be sure to visit a man at dinner time. well, come, sit downe, and doe as I doe. heres good flesh Sinew. I but my teeth water at another gates peece of flesh, I haue no stomach to thyne. Barebones. why what bit dost thou long for? Sinew. One that you must help mee to if any of your masters diuells [will] mee so good a turne. Barebones. And 'tweare an ill turne there are divells enough to be had[,]: marry for a good turne I doubt they will hardly be intreated, for my master lets im out so to brokers and vsurers that they learne nothing but such craft and cruelty that a man knows not how to trust them. but what would you with them? Sinew. O Barebones; The little God of Loue has coudgell'd the great god of warre out of mee; in which conflict I was wounded to the hart with the loue of Mr s. Caro: a pretty peece of flesh she is, and vnlesse poore Sinew be infolded in that flesh, I shall remayne in a moste miserable case. Barebones. why doest thou hope to conquer a castle, and canst not winne a wench? Sinew. Alas man, there is one Bloud a servant to the Lord Colactus, a proud boasting courtier hee is, who though he came but out of an ould smokie thatch'd house yet braggs of his pedegree and progenitors five generations before Iupiter. This muskie fellow has gotten into her affection, and foists me out of her fauour. Now if you could get one of your Masters goblins to [winn] make Mr s. Caro sticke to Sinnew in spite of hot Bloud: then should Sinew cling close to Barebones till both of vs be dead and rotten. Barebones. I doubt not of the strength and toughnesse of your loue, being a souldier and your name Sinew, I assure my selfe you will not shrincke willingly. [[illeg.]] Sinew. Let the Sinews of frendship persuade you that I am moste certainly your servant. gives him money. Barebones. I doe feelingly beleeue your faithfullnesse: but I haue not seen a servant pay his master wages before. Well, since your Lord Lysander and my master Cyprian loue one another so well; I will tempt my Master to co?aund one of his Deuills to tempt Mr s. Caro to yeild her selfe to your co?aundement. And see where he Enter Lysander and Cyprian conferring. comes, and your lord with him; pat for our purpose. Sinew. I had rather my Lord weare away. but hap what will, I am ouerheat and must into the water though I [die] drown for't. Cyprian. Now Sirrah, what's the buisnes with you? Barebones. I am no taylor, [and] yet I bring you a suite sir, which I hope my Lord Lysander will help on. Cyprian. I wish it be worth the wearing, because it is stuffe of your commending. [well] Lysanders. If it be any thing reasonable [(honest Barebones) thy] [your] Master shall not deny it thee. Barebones. I thancke your L.h p. This tis. They whisper. Sinew. Now venus be propitious; and yet I erre in praying to a [god] heauenly power for help from hell. No, o Pluto remember thou wast once in loue, and be thou pittifull. see they smile, that puts me in some comfort yet. Lysander. Sinew, come hither. Sinew. Now! shall I haue rods or roast meat trow? Lysander. why are you absent from the camp sir? Sinew. Because your Lordship is not present there, [and] since you[r] are put out of your generalls place I scorne to serve any that vsurps your roome. Lysander. Y'haue got a subtle answer: but the truth is y'are turn'd a carpet knight, are fall'n in loue, and giv'n to Idlenesse. Barebones. Alas my Lord, 'tis not that he delights in idlenesse; he would faine bee doing, but that another has got his worke out of his hand. Cyprian. Well, for your Masters sake your suite is graunted. see Barebones heres a spirit that to you Enter Cantharides. is now and shalbe only visible he shall convert that louely peece of fflesh into what mould you will. Lysander. And when that's done, Sinew returne to mee. Cyprian. Come lets walke on. Exeunt. Lysander and Cyprian. Sinew. Is the Spirit come allready? Barebones. I marry is hee; if you could see him as I can, you would take him for one of these flies that sucke sweetmeats out of dunghills. what's thy name my little inch of damnation? Cantharides. My Name is Cantharides. Sinew. I heare him though I see him not. what's him name says hee? Barebones. [what] Cantharides! ha ha ha. the fittest name for a pimp that can bee. Cantharides is a baudy flie, of wc h the apothecarys make a provocative medicine, that stirrs vp lust beyond all performance. This fly was pandar to the God Priapus, and therfore is a very skillfull [at] caterer[g] in the flesh market. Sinew. [Braue] Honest Barebones I am thine foreuer. but I languish to see this feat effected. Barebones. come my little fflesh-fly, thou must claw the kiddneys of Mr s. Caro, and make the water of her desires runne into the shooes of Mr. Sinew, that he may no longer draw driefoot in the quest of her. Cantharides. I am at your co?aund. Exeunt. Sce. 3. Enter Cyprian and Lysander. Cyprian. ffie my Lysander quench not the pow'rfull sparcks Nature has kindled in thy valiant brest. false ffortune cannot lessen a full man. Our weaker parts of Earth are only ty'd to th'turning wheel of the worlds blindefold guide: the minde's aboue her anger. keep thine so. Lysander. O Cyprian, thou now dost come to mee as willing, but vnskillfull swi?ers doe; who when their frend strives allmost dead in water beare both themselues and him vnto the bottome. Thou'rt vnexperienc'd in the change I feele; for by thy willing, but vntimely counsell, in stead of comfort bring'st confusion. Cyprian. Thy sicke taste giues my [mede] cordialls ill report, when they deserve best recompence. Lysander. pray tell mee, what is the cause of night? Cyprian. why the sunnes absence. Lysander. Miranda is the mouer of loues sphÃ¦re, my day, and cause of all my lightsome ioys. her absence is the cause that sullen night settles this dullnesse on my ioylesse soule. Cyprian. Miranda's absence is her happinesse, her present safetie; would you wish her here threaten'd with fathers lust and crueltie, and wounded with the downfall of her frends? [To meet such dangers Greife] woe changes loue either to greife or phrensie. who wishes sight of loue in sorrows caue; desires the name, and not the thing to haue. Lysander. But I that late was [layd] dandled in the [the] lap of princely loue, am fall'n from my advancements. [Cyprian. who fa] And my inferiours step into my place. Cyprian. Who falls from honour, gets aboue all enuie: Thy fall to thee is but a meanes to rise; Their rise to them may be a meanes to fall. Lysander. My flocking frends are fled, now none salute mee. Cyprian. Thy flatterers are fled, thy frends remaine. Lysander. You doe remayne indeed, my only frend. whose patience I must prayse, allthough my selfe receive your comforts[,] but like well limn'd pictures of sweet content, which when beheld and past leaue some inpression, but too weake to last. Cyprian. Nor blame I your somwhat impatience, considering your heat [streng] of youthfull bloud. high spirits haue mightie passions, while let loose; which wisdome wills vs binde to good behauiour. Marcke but our potent and victorious Souldan, how his vncurbed furie drives him on with fier and sword against great Babilon: within him pride of conquest ioyn'd with lust make him as captive to the foulest sinnes as he makes others to his monarchy. while wee thrown of from his vncertayne favours, stand now exempt from flattering his [ires] passions; and if wee list, in our more quiet state may pitty him when hee proues vnfortunate. Lysander. But while I thincke vpon anothers fate I stand amazed at myne owne misfortune, that know not what I am, nor whence deriv'd, nor how to catch times fortop in my fist, that I may scape from hence, and seeke my loue. Cyprian. To know thy selfe, time, and my arte shall teach thee; and for thy loue, doubt not, she loues thee so as both your cares will make you meet.[;] [lets goe] but see [Thetis, from whose [gate]] [sol][the e] highs him to his [watry couch, the earth] gate A mist is rising, let vs home, 'tis late.

No princely sir, 'tis I would bee cast of; for I am false. My beauty has bewitch'd your noble heart, weakend your valour, and most treacherously betray'd ChaldÃ¦a's glorie Babilon to Egypts rage. Clitophon. O fairest of thy sex, blame not thy beauty, but thy cruelty, say but thou lou'st mee, and that very sound (like the rare harpe that rays'd the Theban walls) shall reerect, and fortifie my courage; rescue the cittie, and drive backe the foe.

My gracious Lord, the Califfe calls for you. Clitophon. ffor what? to rob mee of my happinesse. Lord. O princely sir; the citty wants your presence.

Iustina. haue you forgot your promise to your heir so lately made? is this your loue[,]? my safety? Califfe. Thou shalt be safe if [seas] waues will let thee sincke. Iustina. Is then a princes word so slight to trust! But come faith breaking tyrant, doe thy worst. If for my Christian faith, I needs must drowne, send mee to sea with speed; I shall survive, or els at heauens hauen soone arrive. Califfe. Are you so stout? Souldiers in Euphrates cast me this minion, drowne her in the streame. There let her beauty, and her christian learning enchaunt the sea gods. they no more shall charme the prince of Babilon. away with her. Iustina. Is there no advocate? no intercession? are all about mee ministers of death? Califfe. The pow'r thou serv'st preserve thee, if it can. Iustina. Tyrant I thancke thee, thou dost kindely pray And I will pray for thy renowned sonne: heau'n make a christian of kinde Clitophon. Califfe. Shall she torment mee thus? dragge her away. Drag her in. Now trie the pow'r thou serv'st if it can calme Euphrates rugged waues. so, now I trust with her I drowne the passions of my sonne, and free him from Christian contagion. when reason and a fathers awfull charge prevaile not, we with policie assay to turne the wanton tide another way. Now to the feild, to see what deeds are done By Armidan and our vndaunted sonne. Exeunt. Sce. 2. Enter Bloud and Caro. Bloud. Come my faire Caro, thou shalt bee my Hero, and Ile bee thy Leander. Caro. Ile crosse the story, then my dearest Bloud, [and where] and where Leander swoo? the Hellespont to come to Hero, I will swim a sea to meet with thee. Bloud. Why thou art fflesh, and I am Bloud, we cannot be divorced without death to both: for flesh and bloud can not beare it. And by the honour of my ancestors (all of the race of Ptolomie the great, and by my mother I descended am from Tomiris the [valiant] conquering Queen of Scythia.) If Caro match with Bloud, she matches into honour, and shall in Egypts court be dignified, and through great Memphis in a chariot ride. Caro. Now by my frayltie (loue) I sweare, no life likes mee but the courtiers, it is so full of ease and pleasure; which the flesh desires aboue all things. your churlish souldier when hee woes mee, me thincks his very lookes scarre me all ouer, and fright me out of loues delight. Enter Sinew and Cantharides and see where such a fellow comes. [lets not looke at him] lets not looke at him. Sinew. [Sinew.] Honey, and roses, Mr s. Caro. Cantharides claws Caro. Bloud. Wormwood, and assafÃ¦tida, Mr. Sinew. she cannot intend to heare you Caro. Stay; what would you with mee sir? Bloud. Haue you a flout ready for him? too him iffaith, and Ile second yoÂ«uÂ» Sinew. (asside to h) You know I loue you, loue you faithfully. Caro. (asside ... )My fancie alters strangely on a suddain. ( ... asside.) Sir, I confesse I haue much wrong'd your faithfull loue. ffie courtier, you smell so sweet of muske, that my head akes with it: such sweets are nought for the mother, and that's a disease I am subiect to. There was one flout, will you second it? Bloud. (asside to her.) Life of mee; but you must explayne your selfe, hee'l thincke you flout mee els. Caro. Why that I will. Noble Sinew, I could plucke out my too too credulous eies, that persuaded me to preferre a courtier before a souldier. why now you stand together, the grossnesse of my error is apparant. you haue a manly forme, this when the leaues of his bravery is of, is but a crooked crab stocke. a thing that had had no being but for the mercie of a credulous mercer, and an vnpay'd taylor, who weare the good beares that lick'd him into fashion. Bloud. How's this, how's this? Sinew. Will you yet loue mee then? Caro. Take here my hand, while on this booke I vow No man aliue shall haue my loue but thou. Kisse. Sinew. welcome sweet Caro. Sinew shall giue both sense and motion to all thy delight, while in my marshiall armes I thus immure thee, and boldly bid defiance to him that dares offer to take thee from mee. Enter Barebones stands beholding Caro. Bloud. But Mr s. Caro, is this seeming change of yours reall and substantiall or is it but in mirth? Caro. If you can make mirth of it, you are the wiser: but I assure you this action of myne is reall and substantiall. A courtier is but banqueting stuffe to wanton withall when the belly is full. a Souldier is good strong lasting diet, a woman may feed hartyly on't and neuer surfet. Bloud. To [match without][refuse] bloud [in marriage] is to match out of gentry. will you marry so basely? Caro. O sir, Bloud without fat makes leane puddings: and gentry without money is not halfe so good as rich yomandrie. [Bloud.], Sinew. Hee that stands looking on his meate, and will not eate it while it is warme, deserv's to haue his trencher shifted, and to be content with a cold bit, or els fast and welcome. Bloud. Well I'le be reveng'd: and Souldier though I haue no skill in boystrous busslyng; know that I being a courtier can finde a tricke to stop a souldiers pay, and keep him bare enough. then when the warres are done, you may either steale and be hang'd, or beg, and be whipt for a rogue. And as for you wethercocke, I shallâ Sinew. Sirrah, I haue with contempt borne the battery of your tongue against mee, but if you shoot out [but] one sillable in disgrace of my loue, Ile play the surgeon, and with this lancet let out your wilde bloud. Caro. Nay, let him alone my loue; I minde him not. Barebones. O delicate Caro! O dull pated Barebones! what an asse was I to help another to such a daynty morsell, and let my selfe fast that haue as good a stomach as hee. has not Barebones as much need of fflesh, as any Sinew in the world? Yes, and I will make my selfe amends imediately. Cantharides come hither. Sinew. Bloud, me thinckes you looke as you weare enflam'd. They whisper. get you a cooling iulep. Come Caro, let vs to the temple, and there consu?ate our ioys. Cantharides claws her. Caro. With thee I will goe any whither. ha! stay a little. fixes her eie on Barebones. Barebones. O that a poore scholler might haue had leaue to read Tully's loue in such a faire printe. I should then haue lou'd my booke better then my meate. Sinew. I Barebones, she is faire indeed, tha[t]ncke heau'ns goodnesse; and she is myne now, thancke thy kindenesse. Caro. Thyne! learning forbid it. Sir, if your wish be harty, I willingly will be your booke: vnclaspe mee, turne me ore, and reade mee till you are weary; then doe as schollers vse; rest a while, and too't againe: I will be none but yours. Barebones. Then In speech shall co?end you, the merry moods and tenses shall attend you, the qui's and quÃ¦'s and quod's shall [attend you] bee at your [service] co?aund. And I my selfe will serve you as long as I can stand. Sinew. O the Devill! Bloud. (asside.) will she change againe? Sinew. But are you constant in this vnconstancie? Caro. Alas women haue nothing els to be constant in. My name is Caro, that signifies flesh: now flesh you know is frayle; somtimes it battens, and somtimes it bates; and we cannot help it. Sinew. And sometimes it stincks, and sometimes its fly blowne; now maggots eate you. But this is your treachery Barebones: you haue her in the Devills name, and the Divell giue you good of her. Barebones. O you know the bones euer beare the flesh away. to Blood. would you haue her swim in blood like a halfe boyl'd leg of mutton? to Sinew. Or would you binde her vp with sinewy strings like a coller of brawne while 'tis boyling? fie, fie. Come my plump peece of flesh, let vs too ioyne gibblets now, whyle they goe seeke their flesh at goose-faire. Bloud. Ha ha ha ha. this is excellent. Exeunt. Barebones, Caro, and Cantharides. Where is your purchase? did not you cheat me? Sinew. True, and am cheated againe. But Ile be reveng'd. Bloud. Why are you not then? a souldier, and not strike? Sinew. I durst not for his devill that attends him. But I will finde a time. Bloud. This is some revenge to mee allready. ha ha ha. Exeunt severally. Sce. 3. Enter [Cyprian and] Lysander and Cyprian. Lysander. Strong is thy loue (my frend) but counsell weake. Cyprian. Weake is thy iudgement that wants strength to sway thy passions, which like ouerturned bells can keep no tune nor time. come, let mee tell you, It staynes the name of valour in a man to wish for death because he would be freed from sufferings in [t]his life. would you not scorne him as a coward, that for smart of wounds would runne out of the feild? I know you would. troubles, are but the tryalls of our minde, sharp sawces to the food of our [delights] contents, wch make them relish better. Lysander. You speake trueth. But speaking comforts seldome lessen woes. Cyprian. Then see Lysander, I will cheer the now with actuall comforts. You haue often wish'd, and wood my skill to make thee vnderstand thy parentage. Lysander. True my deare Cyprian and nothing sounds more pleasant in myne eares then that relation. Cyprian. I haue brought thee now here to the bancke of famous Euphrates of purpose that this solitarie place may feast thee with such pleasures as shall blunt [as shall blunt] the sharpest edge of thy conceived sorrow. fix well thyne eie vpon the sedgie shore and marke what comes from thence. Lysander. Dauntlesse Ile looke, what ere be thy attempt, pleasures are sweet in sorrow, though but dream'[p]t. Thunder. Enter a Spirit, Like a souldier in armour on his breast a sable sheild written on with [Golden] letters. Cyprian. what see'st thou now. Lysander. I see an armed man. bearing before his breast a sable[r] sheildâ Fill'd full with [siluer] golden letters. Cyprian. [Th] In that plate read and observe, for there is writ thy fate. Lysander reads. The Souldan's father call'd Archimachus when first the Syrian land he sought t'haue wonne; His spies by chance surpriz'd Eugenius, a childe of 2. yeares ould, the only sonne of stout Archander, Antiochs king of late. ffaire was the childe and got the Souldan's loue, and with it life that reach'd to manly state. The Souldan brought him vp like one aboue co?on nobilitie; but chang'd his name into Lysander, who's now crownd with fame. Recorders play. The Spirit vanishes. It vanishes, and I can read no more. Recorders still. Enter an Angell shaped like a patriarch vpon his breast a [[red] blew] table full of silver letters, in his right hand a red crossierstaffe, on his shoulders large [wings] Cyprian. whence comes this sound? this heau'nly harmonie? what apparition's this rais'd without mee? Angell. Thou by whose skill [his] anothersfate was showne shalt finde thy selfe ignorant of thine owne. Read here, [her] and learn thyne owne catastrophe. Cyprian reads. Cyprian borne at Antioch, bred in arts of deep caldean learning, by whose skill Wonders are wrought. since in him vertuous parts are found, it is the gracious heauens will, that now ere long, this learned heathen man shall renounce Magicke, and turne Christian. Lysander. These are strange, and vnlikely auguries. Cyprian. whence art thou? or who sent thee with these news? Angell. I come not by the call of magicke spells; but by that pow'r that in yond pallace dwells am sent to tell these news. But when againe I meet thee, thou'lt confesse thy learning vayne. ffor such a light Ile bring shall make thee see, thou to that houre liu'd'st in obscuritie. Exit Angelus. Cyprian. Bring what thou wilt, thy presence is so full of maiestie, that sure thou arte some god; for I admire and tremble at thy sight. Lysander. Our fates are strange ones both; m?eof things past thyne yet to come. let me recall myne owne. Archander King of Antioch my father! My name Eugenius, heir vnto that Kingdom! Thancks Cyprian for this discovery. But how has ignorance misled my life, that vnrelenting I should bathe my sword [in myne o] in myne owne bloud! ruine my countrey, ioy at the last groanes of my deare kindred, see Archander my deare father, and my vnckle the braue Lysymachus fall by a pow[']r led by my arme and counsell. Cyprian. This was that wch I call'd madnesse in you, when you first [cam] enter'd my study in lost Antioch. but heau'n will pardon ignorant offences. come cheer thy minde. Lysander. Then let vs cast about to revenge Antioch on th'Egyptians, and seat mee in myne owne inheritance. Cyprian. In that, as in your loue, time will befrend you; Meane while be as you weare, the Souldans servant. Crye within. help help. [Noise within.] Lysander. Harck, from the woods I here a pitious crie. Cyprian. Let's stay, and see th'euent. Enter 2. Souldiers dragging Iustina. bound. 1. Souldier. Come, now w'are allmost at our iourneys end; This is swift Euphrates, here cast her in. Iustina. Are yee of flint? is there no pitty lodg'd within your bruitish breasts to spare my life? cannot my guifts, my teares, my innocence, your conscience, feare of heauens vengeance hold your bloody hands? o giue these wearie feet a little rest, a little while vouchsafe a truce 'till I may pray 2. Souldier. Prate not of prayer. 1. Souldier. Come let's cast her in. Lysander. O help to rescue yonder Innocent. Cyprian. Leaue that to mee Lysander, sit you still. 2. Souldier. Come this way, this way, heare the streame is deepest. 1. Souldier. I am enforc'd I know not by what pow'r To hale her this way. Thunder. Enter 2. Tritons with silver trumpets. 2. Souldier. what strange noise is this? 1. Souldier. dispatch, the tide swells high. 2. Souldier. what feind is this? The tritons ceaz the souldiers. 1. Souldier. what furie ceazes mee? 2. Souldier. Alas, I'm hurried headlong to the streame. The Tritons dragge them in sounding their trumpets. 1. Souldier. And so am I, wee both must drowne and die. Iustina. What wondrous sight flatters my dying eies? am I deliuer'd from the iaws of death? Lysander. Lady, you are, your ministers of death haue met the punishment they meant for you. Cyprian. (asside.) how faire her lookes! how sweet her woeful words! Lysander. Lady, (for by your habit so you seeme) what countrey are you of, what birth and kinne? Iustina. Of Antioch, my father was a prince by name Lysymachus, vnhappy brother to the once great Archander Antiochs King; till Egypts furie wrought our ruining, Lysander. my vnckles daughter! fortunate ill lucke that made this meeting: I'm Archander's sonne that in my childhood was stol'n into Egypt. Iustina. My ioys haue now the mastrie of my feares. Lysander. My dearest cousin, [we] at a fitter time Ile winne your credit by moste certain tokens. Iustina. Although with wonder, I beleeue and ioy in't. Lysander. you seem a harmelesse soule; what foule offence had you the pow'r to doe to deserve this? Cyprian. That wee'l intreat her by the way relate. Come lets away, great actions are in feild, [Archimach] The Souldan is in danger to be taken. Lady co?it your safety to my trust. Iustina. I feare not man, since heau'n doth help the iust.

      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. Sce. 1. Alarme. Enter [Miranda sol[ileg.]] Colactus wounded with his sword drawn, Colactus. What furie brought this Clitophon to feild? he fights as Victorie weare fall'n in loue with[e] him, and the relentlesse fates themselues durst not oppose his valour. he deales his blows as if we need not wish a greater honour [the] then to be beaten by him. with him comes second to his bravadoes a young man, wh? (had hee been a woman) by his face I should persuade my selfe to be Miranda: at mee his only ayme is, and so fiercely that I come of thus wounded from his hand. The day is surely lost, and I must shift away for help; else shall I bleed to death. Exit. Sce. 2. Alarm still. Enter Miranda with her sword drawn. Miranda. What squadron Leads Lysander? this keen sword has digg'd my way through many a bleeding bulke to finde him out; and yet we cannot meet. Colactus I haue often singled out, and though his basenesse weare not worth my wounds, yet for his counsell to my fathers lust this hand hath lent him some. Young Clitophon fiercely pursues my father, whose distresse can finde no rescue: weare Lysander there would hee haue suffred it? no through the throng hee like a whirlewinde would teare ope his way to meet the fierce youth with amazing strokes. he's absent sure: pray heau'n hee bee not slayne. slayne did I say? fie, fie that cannot bee surely that feare came from my sex, not mee. flourish and Shout within. Ha! then our day is lost, and wee haue wonne. Our Souldan's fled, or slayne, or taken sure; and wee of Babilon are conquerers. What opposition of the heau'nly lights was midwife to the birth of my crosse fate? first change my contrey, and myne owne attire; then charge my father as my greatest foe; backe his moste enimies impugn his frends; In bloud of Egypt bathe Egyptian hands: ffor thee Lysander haue I done all this. [Flourish.] &amp; [Sennet.] Enter in state the Califfe, Clitophon leading the Souldan bound; noblemen, and souldiers. Miranda. [Tru] Too true was my suspicion; o my fate[,]! that I a naturall childe should thus behold My father thrall vnto his enimie, and I a partner in the victorie! Califfe. Now art thou prisoner proud Egyptian. Souldan. what is my ransom, and it shall be payd. Clitophon. All Affricke shall not buy thee backe againe. Souldan. Death with redeem me then. Califfe. Proud Souldan know, thou now shalt stoop to vs, and thy wilde pride be turn'd to humble tamenesse. Souldan. Dost thou thincke [in] Insulting Califfe, that the [li] Lyon trembles at crowing of a cocke, because ould tales so still'd the infant world? weare it a truth, yet my contempt of thrall[,] shall make't appeare I haue the Lions courage, not his feare. Califfe. Are you so stout? cast that ambitious beast downe at our feet, [that I ma] leuell him with the ground, that [I] wee may trample on his stubborn necke, and as his pride has made him menace heau'n, so let him proue the humblest on the earth. Souldan. Seeke not so basely to abuse a prince of my Imperiall state; set downe my ransome Clitophon. What randsom can a beggar spoyl'd of all render his lord? all that thou hadst is ours. Souldan. wee loose not all our fortunes in one feild. Califfe. Yes, and thy life, vnlesse thou stoop and kneele. Souldan. Ile stoop to none, but to the Roman Empire. Califfe. wee'l force thee stoop to vs, and grouell flat whyle on thy backe we tread. throw down [our] my slaue: Miranda. Shall I endure to see my father trod on? Great prince desist from this vndecent force; I should haue some share in this victory Califfe. Braue youth, thy valour shall be recompens'd with honours and promotions: but in this what canst thou aske? or what is this to thee? Miranda. My courage is not quickend with rewards, nor will I serve but to a [valiant] vertuous prince. I tell thee [mightie] cruell Califfe, I repent mee that I haue fought, and ventur'd life for him that houlds no measure in his happinesse. This tyrannie staynes all thy victorie: Califfe. This to a tyrant is no tyrannie. Miranda. Tis tyrannie thus to abuse his age, to tread that reverent body vnderfoote, whose head has been impal'd with diamonds as rich as thine. Califfe. How Armidan! so bould? Clitophon. My royall father; let this controversie. by my Iustina be decided, shee has by the Souldan suffer'd vtter ruine, which makes her iustly hate him. if she say, Let him be made your footstoole; he shall bow mauger all pleading. but if she remitt, your lesser iniuries may spare this spite. Califfe. She is vnfit to iudge, and farre to fetch. Clitophon. how! farre to fetch? I left her to your trust, and in your safeguard I expect to finde her. Then call her forth; here haue I brought your foe, My promise is perform'd, let yours be so. bring me my bride. Califfe. Thy bride has left thee sonne. Clitophon. Left me? it cannot be beleeu'd; good Sir, let one right word vnriddle that same Left. I know Iustina would not leaue my loue till life left her. Califfe. Your selfe resolues the riddle. Clitophon. Is she then dead? Califfe. She is, and with her die thy fond loue. Clitophon. O perfidious crueltie! Could you doe this? the panthers breath is sweet, but hee nere to be tam'd; with words perfum'd You gaue her hand to myne, and made her gird my sword on whyle your vnrelenting heart forg'd daggers gainst her life. Could you doe this? and could that innocent sweetnesse that would tempt Iove to transforme his godhead to some beast to faune [vp]on her, [[illeg.]] persuade no pitty from [thee] you? When Iove appear'd a beast, his minde was milde; When beasts weare human shapes, they'r fierce and wilde. Would you my loue should die to my Iustina? No, it shall euer liue; but die to thee all dutie, and all ioy of victorie. The name of father shall both die and rot; and Babilon[,] for euer be forgot. Come hither Souldan. Califfe.

Exit Clitoph?. Califfe. Stay Clitophon, forget not duty thus. Miranda. had you remembred mercie to [your] his loue, you had prevented this ill threatning anger. Califfe. Wretched'st of men! Lords call him backe againe. The Souldiers drop away. What, will my souldiers follow Clitophon and leaue me singly to oppose the Souldan? O stay, and pitty Babilons distresse in travaile with extremities of warre. Like Autumne leaues the glories of my state fall so fast from mee, that [like] as a winters tree[s] I naked stand subiect to eu'ry storme. What counsell lords? is there no way to safety? Miranda. I haue a proiect if it rightly hit, and be by you approv'd that doubtlesse shall either make you the victor, or at least saue the great hazard of much bloud and daunger. Califfe. What proiect noble Armidan can proue so able as thy words would warrant? Miranda. This: Send straight a challenge to th'Egyptian camp, dare the proud Souldan to make choyse of one of his cheife leaders, in a single fight to be his champion, and maintaine his right; By name Lysander his cheife generall. If hee consent, Ile meet him in the feild, And either die, or make that champion yeild. Califfe. The Topaze has the vertue to stop bloud, and appease furie; both these precious pow'rs thy counsaile brings with it, couragious Knight. Thou hast recomforted my fainting minde; and art to mee my sonne, my ioy, my hope. Call straight a herald, let him be dispatch'd vpon this message.

Now if this challenge take, I haue my wish. I shall behould Lysander once againe; and hope this enterview shall worcke a peace betwixt our Egypt and this Babilon.

O the devill, that euer a man should loue a woman truly! [I could] I could not be content to enioy[s] Caro as my concubine which in that humor she would willingly haue been; but I must marrie her with a murren. And now the power of the charme is spent, and she come to her selfe againe, she is mad at her match, hates me, rayles at mee, vows to my teeth to [mak] cuckold mee, and like a moste cruell creature all her delight is in Bloud: she hangs about his necke in my presence; and bids mee cut of all my booke strings, knit them together, and so make a halter to hang my selfe withall. Nay though she cares not for Sinew, yet before me she will kisse him, and co?end him, only to vex me. O Cantharides, why did your charme last no longer?[,] I would haue had her kept in that minde euer. Cantharides. O sir, all the Deuills in hell cannot make a woman constant. Barebones. I beleeue it, for constancie is a vertue, and the Devill has nothing to doe with it. But thou canst keep her in vnconstancie, and after she has held her hatefull humor a while, thou canst make her louing againe; canst thou not? Cantharides. Yes, I can claw her into loue of you againe presently. Barebones. O no, no, not so soone good Cantharides, that loue is but lust, And my poore bones haue spent so much marrow vpon her allready that my stocke is not sufficient to satisfie her ramping humor yet. Cantharides. Well, for good fellowship sake, because wee both serve [both] one Master, Ile finde another tricke to fetch you out of the briars. Barebones. Wilt thou [deare] Cantharides? doe it; and I will feed thee with syrups and sweet meats, my pretty humble bee. but how? but howÂ«?Â» Cantharides. why you know the flie Cantharides bites so venomously that he will make any man madde for the time. now Ile bite some of them out Ent. of these fancies into other humors.

See where Bloud and she come together. o my head how it akes to see this sight. but remember thy promise Cantharides. stands close. Caro. Sweet Bloud, I thancke thee that thou hast forgiven my madnesse was euer woman so besotted, to forsake court sweetmeats to gnaw vpon bare-bones wc h is but dogs meat! Bare-bones. She shews her selfe a Bloud-hound, yet scornes to feed with dogs. Caro. (asside ... ) The slaue feeles in his bed like a bakers dried bavin, a smooth round billet weare a princely bed fellow to him[,].(asside ... ) O my sides and hips, how sore they are with the grateing of his elbows and hucklebones! Barebones. O damnable changeling! (asside) [and] when she felt mee first in bed, she cried the nearer the bone the sweeter the flesh. Bloud. ffaith Barebones will get on thee such infant anatomies, that the Surgeons will buy them vp to saue them selues the labour of making Sceletons. Caro. Sweet, shall you and I haue a match at shittlecocke? Bloud. O you are too quicke for mee in flying from one to another. Barebones. (asside.) I, Ile sweare is she. Caro. Then let's play at laugh and liedowne. Bloud. Content, and Ile shew thee a courtiers bounty, giue the a green gowne. Barebones. Hold Mr. Courtier; green is not fit colour for a schollers wife to weare. Caro. Avaunt thou map of miserie, thou reli? of a long consumption, thou fag end of a devouring famine: dost thou thincke I can content my selfe with a gaunt thingutted rawbon[e]'d booke-ruffler? who art halfe purblinde with ouer poring, and hast distilled thy braynes into thyne inckhorne. no, no; therfore stay not here to stop my delight, lest I make thee pandar to thyne owne hornes. Barebones. O impudence. now help Cantharides. Enter Sinew disguised with a letter. Cantharides. Time enough, I warrant you. feare not. Sinew. By your leaue gentlemen; is there not a gentleman here called Mr. Bloud, an attendant on the lord Colactus? Bloud. Yes sir, what with him? Sinew. This letter from your Lord: I came in haste from the campe to bring it you. Bloud. I would your haste had been lesse. sweet loue I must leaue thee; my lord has sent for me in earnest speed. Barebones. O ioyfull news! and in moste happie time. Sinew. (asside.) My counterfet letter takes most wishedly. Caro. Must it be so? then Ile along with thee. nothing shall part vs now. Barebones. O hell-bred wildefier can nothing quench thee! Sinew. (asside ... ) death [[illeg.]], then is my plot confounded.( ... asside) Nay sir you must not carry a clog along with you. your haste is of more importance. so please you, Ile bring her after you. Bloud. I will rather venture a little of my Lords displeasure sir, then leaue her behinde. Sinew. ffie, this worse and worse. Cantharides. Now is my cue. Bites Bloud by the arme. he starts from Caro, and runnes vp and downe hollaing: so Exit. Caro. Amazement falls vpon me: how comes this? Is Bloud vnwilling, I should goe with him that in this madde forme he outrunnes mee thus? Barebones. O excellent Cantharides: now begins thy sport. Sinew. This is a strange, but happie accident. how it befell Ile stand not to enquire; but take the opportunitie and shew my selfe. Deare Caro, you may see a courtiers loue is quickly tyr'd; now my disguise is of, you know mee for your souldier. I tried Bloud with this counterfet message and you see he is not pure; for hee is glad of the occasion to shift his hands of you. Now looke on mee, your constant Sinew that will neuer shrincke. Caro. Villayn tis thou hast rob'd me of my ioy, and made my bloud runne from me: my cheeks shall looke pale vpon thee for it, and my hart hate thee. Sinew. Are all the hopes of my plot come to this? Cantharides bites him. hart, what's that bites mee. He draws his sword and runns vp and downe crying sa sa sa tarararara; so Exit. Caro. O excellent, he that certaynly made Bloud mad; is falln franticke himselfe. I would wish no more but that Barebones weare in the same case too. Cantharides. And you shall haue your wish for once: Bites Barebones. Barebones. So, so; this is braue. thancks for this, Cantharides. Ough, Amo amas, he thats[[illeg.]] in loue is an asse. As in prÃ¦senti, one woman will make twenty. Quod dat in datitum, [he that] giue them their due and smite um. [when] if the sight of theyr husbands affright um; then shall Cantharides bite um; and there's the straight um et right um. Exit. Caro. ha ha ha ha ha. some pow'r aboue has heard my wish. o let mee laugh my belly full. Cantharides. So thou shalt, and till thou art wearie. Bites her. She starts, runns vp and down laughing. &amp; so exit. Cantharides. hoh, hoh, ho. Now has my devill-ship had sport enough. with my familiar Barebones and his mates. Now let them shift: Ile leaue them to their fates. Exit. Sce. 4. [Hoboys] A Dumb Shew. Enter at one Dore the Souldan with souldiers, from the other a Herald meets him, delivers him a paper. The Sould? sends in a souldier, who brings Lysander. Hee kneels, the Souldan embraces him, and shews him the paper, hee kisses it, beckons to the Herald, houlds out the paper with his left hand and lays his right hand on his sword. With courtesy they part. The Souldan and Herald goe of severally. Lysander stays. Lysander. How princes when they stand in need of men can faune vpon their subiects! the proud Souldan that lately banisht me the camp, in haste now sends for mee, embraces, honours mee with wishing I had led his army vp to Babilon at first, for then hee thinckes he had not tane the foyle. And now from thence a challenge comes, from one call Armidan, who singles mee by name to combat him, to cleare the right of both the royalties. I've vndertaken it; and the Herald's gone to beare my answer backe. Thus tyrants doe, wrong those they may be moste behoulding to. Exit. Sce. 5. Enter Cyprian and Iustina. Cyprian. Doe not disdayne faire peece of Natures pride to heare him plead for loue that sau'd thy life. It was my pow'rfull arte produc'd those monsters to drown those [more more then] monstrous [m]executioners that should haue wrought your wracke. Iustina. Sir, I am sorry hell had a hand in my deliuery. That action cannot merrit my affection. Cyprian. I not alleadge it for desert of grace, but argument of mercie; pitty him that in distresse so lately pitty'd you. Iustina. I am the troth-plight wife of Clitophon the prince of Babilon, hee has my hart, and there's no share for others. Cyprian. That high state is now at a low ebbe, destruction hangs like a threatning co?et ore the walls of Babilon: Then fix [your] thy loue on him that can more then the greatest prince on earth. Loue mee, and princes shall thy pages bee. [Great Kings] monarchs shall lay their crownes and royalties as presents at thy feet. The Indian mines shall be thy ioynture; all the worlds rich marchants shall bring their pearles and pretious stones to thee, sweet gu?s and spices of Arabia; fair Median Linnen, and Barbarian silkes; the earth shall beare no fruite of raritie, but thou shalt taste it. weele transforme our selues in quaintest shapes to vary our delights; and in a chariot wrought out of a cloud studded with starres, drawne through the subtle aire by birds of paradise, wee'l ride together to fruitfull Thessalie, where in faire Tempe (the only pleasant place of all the earth) wee'l sport vs vnder a pavilion [of] of Tyrian scarlet. Iustina. Should these vanities (faithlesse as are your wondrous promises) lead me into the hazard of my soule and losse of such ay-lasting happinesse. as all earthes glories are but shaddows to? Cyprian. Thincke you this rare pile of perfection wherein Loue reads a lecture of delight ows not it's vse to Nature? there is loue in euery thing that liues, the very sunne does burne in loue; while wee partake his heate. the clyming [yu] ivy with her louing twines clips the strong oake. No skill of surgerie can heale the wounds, nor oceans quench the flames made by all pow'rfull loue. witnesse [your] my selfe, Since first the booke of your perfections was brought so neare that I might read it ore, I haue red in it charmes to countermand [al] all my enchantments, and enforce mee stoop to begge your loue. Iustina. How ere you please to stile a lustfull appetite, it takes not mee. Heau'n has my vow, my life shall neuer bee elder then my vnstain'd virginitie. Cyprian. Virginitie! prize you so dearely that wc h co?on things cast of? marcke but the flow'rs that now as morning fresh, fragrant and faire lay ope their beautys to the courting sunne; and among'st all, the modest mayden rose: These wanton with the aire vntill vnleau'd they die, and so loose their virginitie. Iustina. In India there is a flow'r (they say) which, [when] if a man come neare it, turnes away: By that I learne this lesson to descrie corrupt temptations, and the tempter flie. Exit Iustina. Cyprian. So cold, and coy? [you] I must not [scape me] loose you so: My boyling bloud forbids it. my blacke arte shall make your white thoughts like it. Now's the tyme fit by Lysanders absence: hell shall force her to offer vp that Iewell of delight which. miserlike she yet locks vp in coynesse. with greater heat she shall desire her rape then I haue done. [these] Hells hookes she cannot scape. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. Sce. 1. [Flourish] Enter Claudius a Roman Generall with Captains and Souldiers. Claudius. The pride of Egypt, and the noyse of warre in Babilon, rouzeth our Roman troups to call these princes to a strict account of all their vsurpations. Is not Rome Empresse of all this orbe? doe not her Eagles hatch conquest in their flight, and with theyr wings Compasse all Europ, affricke, Asia? What's Egypt, but a handmaid to great Rome; her very vassall, yet she dares vsurp on Nicomedia, Antioch, and Damasco. Yea, Alexandrian dru?s affright the walls of ancient Babilon, without our leaue. A while we sate, and gaue each neighbour prince leaue to clip short his prouder fellows wing that all might bee the better aw'd by vs, But now the Souldan gets such haughtie head, that (if not soone restrayn'd) hee'l suddainly cast of our yoake, and raise his monarchy. Therfore haue wee gather'd our warlike pow'[e]rs to checke his pride, and keep him humbly ours. A dru? far off. what sound of warre is that? scout, and descrie it. Captaine. A pow'r not great, but skillfully led on; seeming to teach, that multitudes may fayle when a few well trayn'd souldiers shall prevaile. Their leader is but young, yet seemes full ripe; for ancient souldiers serve him, and his lookes at once promise and threaten, like a prince that is both wise and valiant. Claudius. Y'haue display'd their glories colours for them gallantly. This way they come; wee'l stand them sure, and [try] know whether to vs they menace warre or no. Enter Clitophon with Captains and Souldiers. whom doe yee souldiers seeke? Clitophon. ffor Claudius the Roman generall. Claudius. Then haue you found him, I'm that Claudius. Clitophon. Then thus wee vayle, and bow to Rome and thee, as to the supreame head of maiestie. Claudius. Wellcom, and now relate the vrgent cause that brings you thus vpon vs. Clitophon. Romans know I am the Califfs sonne of Babilon, whose forlorn countrey groanes to beare the weight of armed enimies. Egyptian troups flow like an inundation ore [the] our land as Nilus oreflows Egypt: but where Nile makes Egypt fruitfull, these make Syria barren. Claudius. Are you that Clitophon, whose valiant arme tooke the proud Souldan prisoner? Clitophon. Sir I am: and in a discontent freed him againe vpon condition, that againe he should set vpon Babilon; which hee performes; I left it to his rage: but looking backe vpon the bitter fruits of passion, pitty my countrey and repent my furie. And now am come to woo the strength of Rome to help to plucke this sharp Egyptian thorne out of the weeping eie of Babilon. Claudius. Stout prince you haue but met vs in the way: for like a forward bride ere you could wooe we weare prÃ¦par'[e]d to bring you your desires. Clitophon. Our Babilon is bound to honour Rome for euer for this kindenesse. Noble Claudius, march then, my hand full shall attend your troups. Claudius. Tyme sh[all]ould be pretious to vs, let vs on: Claudius is proud to ioyne with Clitophon. Exeunt. Sce. 2. Enter Cyprian solus. Cyprian. My charmes (mee thincks) worke slowly on this virgin, as if they weare asham'd that I should need them: But I in vayne haue vs'd all other helps. The musicke of my words (wc h Orpheus harp could not excell, when it made beasts draw neare) is sung to the deafe adder in her [h] eares. I am not old, nor runne my hot desires in weake and frozen vessells. for my person, It has been by the fairest valu'd so As Nature has had thanckes for't: yet for her I now am forc'd to be asham'd of Nature, and make arte my procurer. Cantharides. Enter Cantharides. Cantharides. Here. Cyprian. How fares my loue? does she yet talke of mee? hast thou yet thaw'd her icie chastitie into bloud warme desire? Cantharides. It is a taske greater then euer Iuno did impose on the vntir'd Alcides. Cyprian. How! Dull slaue; ffetch vp thy fellow furies from the deep. Call vp the Lust provokers from blacke hell that reeking lie vpon their goat-hair'd beds. present her fancie with lascivious visions cast her into long sleeps, and let them bee perpetuall dreames of lustfull actions. Sing in her eares the scapes of Iupiter, and in them sound the name of Cyprian. Convey into the course meat she desires Medicins provocative; tickle her flesh with pensells made of Priapus rough locks; and blast her perfumes with such raging charmes as may enflame her womb with hot desires: That all her senses may at once enforce a carnall eagernesse to be enioy'd. Cantharides. All this is done allready. Cyprian. Let me see this Christian Saint which I (in spite of hell) am forc'd to worship. Iustina is discovered in a chaire asleep, in her hands a prayer book, divells about her. O how heau'nly sweet she looks in midst of hells enchantments, and charmes the fierce feinds at once with rage and wonder. O who would thincke such contrarieties could lodge in peace and amitie together! A tender Body with a tyrant Minde; hard bitter Kernell in a soft sweet Skin; proud fierce Disdaine in so milde humble lookes; A bloudy hart within a milke white breast, and Ages winter in the spring of youth resisting loues assaults. Cantharides. She's at thy mercie dally not but enforce her. Cyprian. That abates of pleasures sweetnesse; if [I must be violent] such violence must be the end yet the beginning shall be milde, and I will steale into [its] my roughnesse by soft gradations. let sweet musicke plead with ravishing [tunes] notes to winne her maidenhead. Musick. A song. How fast shee's charm'd in sleep! But is it sleep? haue yee not hell-hounds with too potent spells giu'n her to death? She stirrs, and sleeps againe. O no, she liues and moues. How well that gentle motion did become her! And yet how sweetly does this stillnesse shew! If she did rise, and walke 'twould give a luster to all her graces: but what need these shaddows where substance is beyond expression. To heare her speake were to mount heau'n and meet the SphÃ¦ricke harmony, and yet this sylence is womans vertue. If she did vnlidde those yuory cases, 2. rich diamonds would dazle humane eies, and tell the world earth is too poore to [by] buy them. hide them still Lest the bright starres seing them selues outshin'd through envie make my loue disasterous. Yet a while longer let thy senses sleep: ffor if thou wake before the charme be done Thou wilt not let mee touch thy lilly hand, nor kisse thy [rosie lipp] rosy lipps; which now I can. Hee offers to Kisse and she starts, wakes, and falls on her knees. Iustina. Forbid it heau'n. Cyprian. Is the enchantment spent,[?] Or wilt not hold? She looks in her booke, and the Spirits fly from her. why doe yee flie and quake? has this weake woman pow'r to make hell shake? Cantharides. Her prayers haue prÃ¦vaild against our spells. Cyprian. Can you not worcke vpon her then? Cantharides. O no. Her faith beats downe our incantations. Cyprian. Her ffaith? O how haue I mispent my tyme That in my studdys could not finde this faith! I did beleeue that Arte could teach the vse and rule of all the world. Was not this ffaith? I did beleeue that Arte could reach to hell and thence fetch secrets vp surpassing arte. Was not this ffaith? I did beleeue that hell could all desires accomplish: But I finde Beleefe is but deluded in this kinde. This is not ffaith. O my ambitious labours that could not bee content with human skill, how are yee lost, and sham'd with womans learning! I that haue frighted Empires, and held kings in aw of mee, am now of arte disarm'd by a weake womans ffaith. ffaire Christian Hee kneels to her. teach mee the sense and vse of this strong spell call'd ffaith, that conquers all the pow'rs of hell; and I will serve you: for without this knowledge there is no liuing for mee Iustina. Thou sayst true, without true ffaith there is no life indeed. Cantharides. What mean'st thou Cyprian, wilt turne Christian? Cyprian. Yes, if the Christian learning haue a power greater then magicke. My deep searching soule cannot be satisfied, but with that skill that diues into the deepest misteries. Iustina. And there's no depth to true divinitie. Cantharides. Thou shalt haue greater pow'r conferr'd on thee then ere thou hadst. Cyprian. Then giue mee pow'r to make this beauty myne. Cantharides. Aske any thing but that: Cyprian. If ouer this weake peece hell haue no pow'r, then there's a skill can make the weakest man more potent then the strongest feind of hell; and that shall be my studdy. Iustina. O bee firme in that resolue, and thou shalt finde thy paynes rightly bestow'd, and richly recompenc'd. Cantharides. Thou art[e] our slaue, and if thou leaue vs thus wee'l teare thee into Atoms. Iustina. Doe not feare. take here this booke; call on that pow'rfull name those pray'rs so oft repeat, and I'l asist you. The feinds roare and fly back. See how they hurt you now, these are true charmes. Cantharides. Throw from thee that accursed witchery, or wee'l torment thee with more horred paynes then mans hart can imagine. Throw't away [Cyprian.] and thou shalt yet be pardon'd thy rebellion against our kingdom. Iustina. Keep it Cyprian, read in it still. Cyprian. I will. Cantharides. wee are confounded. [Soft musicke.][Recorders.] Enter the patriarch-like Angell with his crossier staffe in one hand, and a book in [st] the other. Hide vs yee mountaines, couer vs yee rockes; Our co?on torments now are trebled on vs. OâOâO. The Devills sinck roaring; a flame of fier riseth after them. Angell. Loe Cyprian, to keep my promise, here againe I meet thee. at my sight with feare the feinds are vanish'd, and shall nere come backe to hurt thee; if thy faith thou dost not wracke. And here's the cleare light which I promis'd thee; this shews the blindenesse of philosophie. gives him the Booke. This studdy'd well, will teach thee faith, and bring Thy happy soule where [happy] blessed angells sing. with this touch, let thy carnall lust convert Toucheth his breast with his crosse. to loue of heau'n, let that delight thy harte. And thou Iustina happie Christian maide, Bee not hereafter of this man affrayde. his hart is changed now, thy company shall strengthen him in Christianitie. Haste both of yee to meet with Clitophon who with the Roman hoste comes marching on. Tell him your story; 'twill his heart vnlocke; Then with Lysander high to Antioch: There shall you both (ere long) in Martyrdome Mayntayne your faith, and meet the ioys to come. Exit Angelus. Iustina. Thanckesto that only pow'r that hath so oft preserv'd this clay from ruine, and restrayn'd the malice of my Soules fierce enimie. Cyprian. What subsidies of thanckes am I to send to highest heau'n for my redemption that am deliuer'd from that burning pit; to finde whose bottom, o what paynes I tooke! Men without grace that wander[,] suffer much only to finde out greater sufferings. O take my sighs and groanes (thou gracious pow'r) as part of gratitude till more acquaintance make mee to serve thee with a knowing soule. And blessed be Iustina, and the day I first did see thee: yea my very lust deserv's a blessed memorie, since that was the first, though a foule step to this blisse. And now in [witnesse] token of my [than] loue to heau'n, This Arte wc h heretofore I so esteem'd Thus I abandon, Throws his charmed rod, and his books [into a] [under] the stage. a flame riseth. and these curious bookes thus sacrifice. This sacred [th] trueth aloneâ The Angells booke. shall be my studdy, and my ill spent yeares I expiate with pÃ¦nitentiall teares. Iustina. I ioy at your conversion. heau'n thus brings sweet out of bitter, best from worst of things. But wee must now fullfill the will of heau'n, in meeting Clitophon, and the Roman bands. Cyprian. Lets haste with ioy to what high heau'n co?ands. Exeunt. Sce. 3a. et Vltima. [Flourish.] Enter at one dore the Souldan, Colactus, &amp; Souldiers at the other the Califfe, a Nobleman, Herald, &amp; Souldier Califfe. This is the time by either side prÃ¦fix'd to trie our royall titles. Both our armies stand in a silent expectation of this acts issue, then ere day grow old (Souldan) let vs begin our plea, my fate whether it turne to honour or to losse shall finde my temper Ã¦qually prÃ¦pard to giue it [entertaine] a contented entertaine. Souldan. Lysander is my fate, and in his arme I am assur'd of conquest. then begin. Califfe. Herald, first read the articles againe, that what our selues in private haue allow'd, Our subiects testimonies may confirme, and bee our iury royall when the fight has clear'd our claymes. Herald reads. It is accorded between these two mighty princes, the Souldan of Egypt, and the Califfe of Babilon, that to avoyd the effusion of bloud, and depopulation of their [count] countreys, the title of royaltie shall be decided by single combat, and whose champion soeuer is ouercome, that side to yeild as vanquished. If the Souldans champion [win[illeg.]] winne the day, the Califfe shall yeild vp Babilon and all his royall titles in Syria. And if the Califfes combatant prevaile, then shall the Souldan surrender vp all the forts he hath in Syria, renounce his claims of conquest, and forsaking Babilon with his whole army, neuer returne to offend these parts againe. To these condicions you have both subscrib'd, and sworne. Souldan &amp; Califfe. we haue. Colactus. Then bring the champions. Souldan. ffetch Lysander, Califfe. ffetch Armidan. flourish. Enter Herald with Lysander in armour. Souldan. Lysander, on the fortune of thy arme (which hitherto has led the fates in tryumph) our glories rest, with thee they rise, or fall: adde but this day to thy past victories, and Babilon is added to our crowne. but if this day thou loose (wc h cannot bee) Our Syrian Conquests all with thee must die. Then courage, conquer for thy selfe and vs. what thou winn'st now, hereafter thine shall bee; for wee'l elect no other heir but thee. Lysander. Thy promises great Souldan cannot raise my courage higher then the scale of honour hath lifted it allready. I'm prÃ¦par'd, Nor will I weaken with superfluous words my resolution. where's my opposite? will hee loose so much honnour to be last, that was the challenger? Colactus. we may beleeue the Califfs conquer'd fortunes cannot arme one that dares meet Lysander, but in words. Lord of Babilon. His slacknesse hee'l repaire [by] with his sound blows; and then you'l say, the Califfe armes a man dares meet, and beat the Souldans champion. Flourish. Enter Herald, Miranda following him in her Owne Amazonian attire, an helmet on and the beavor down. Colactus. I cannot say the Califfe armes a man If this outside speake truth: which I should know. Souldan. What spirit of illusion dares our eie! Califfe. This is not our elected champion, we chose no woman; nor intend a maske. Herald. Sir, for some reasons to him selfe best known he's thus disguisd, but this is Armidan. Lysander. Let not my courage melt away in wonder. This [stature] stature, gesture, and this shape she own'd that once was my Miranda. see by signes it calls me on to combate. shall I fight with one so like my loue? for her sake no[,]: what ere you are graunt me to see your face. before we fight. [She lets him take of her helmet.] Miranda. Then shall Lysander see he must be conquer'd by a woman. She puts vp her beavor. Lysander. ha! her voice; 'tis shee. a woman has indeed orecome mee; dearest conqueresse I yeild. this is the fight that best befits you sweet. Miranda. Thus Ladys strike their louers when they meet. Lysander conquers mee; and thus I yeild. Colactus. How now! what kinde of combat call you this? Lord of B. This is fine fighting. Califfe. Traytrous Armidan. Souldan. Villaine Lysander. Miranda. Heare mee mightie princes. To you great sir[,] I bend a daughters knee, and beg at once your pardon and your blessing. Souldan. My daughter? o my shame! Miranda. yet heare mee sir. Rage not to see Lysander yeild to mee; Nor you to see mee yeild to my Lysander: for thus you both are sauers, [neither] though both loose. My yeilding giues the Califfs right to you, his yeilding renders vp your right to him. This offers an attonement [an atton] twixt you both[;] if you accept it; and it was the end I aim'd at in this challenge. Souldan. Rebellious wretch thy oratory's odious as thy selfe. Califfe. Is Armidan a woman, and your daughter? Souldan. Califfe, what ere she was, I now disclayme her. you tooke her for your champion,[s] now you see her falshood merrits death, and so does his [now] that I for my side chose. then doe to her what I will to Lysander for revenge. Draws his sword. Califfe. My wrongs invite me to it; she's a spie, and in my court has liu'd an enimie. Draws his sword. Miranda. 'Tis kindely done yet that you'l kill vs both, for one would not out liue the others death. Alarme within Souldan. what meanes this? Califfe thou art treacherous. Califfe. Souldan 'tis thou. guard [th] vs, there's treason towards. ouldan. To armes, the Babilonians would entrap vs. Califfe. To armes, th'Egyptians haue betray'd our liues. Miranda. what euer haps, I will not stirre from thee. Lysander. In life and death our loues vnited bee. Enter Claudius with Souldiers at one dore, surpriseth the Califfe; Clitophon with souldiers, at the other, he seazeth the Souldan. enter Cyprian and Iustina. Souldan. now Califfe, what's this but thy treacherie? Califfe. Thou play'st the traitor, and accusest mee. Clitophon. Yeild Souldan, once againe thou art my prisoner. Claudius. In Romes great name I charge yee both to yeild. princes your too ambitious discords here with a displeasing voyce haue reach'd to Rome, and call'd vs thence to stint this bloudy strife. How dares the Souldan thus vsurp on kingdomes? Thincke you in time to breake the dutious yoake great Rome has cast about your stubbern neckes? Â«oÂ»uldan &amp; Califfe. No[w], wee submit to Romes supremacie. Claudius. Tis well; goe not about then to destroy your neighbour kingdomes, nor to rayse your selues to single monarchies; which Souldan, you are playnly guilty of. for which wee double your tribute for ten yeares, and charge you straight deliuer vp your claymes in Syria: Return to Egypt, and content your selfe with your owne royalties. Say Cyprian, is your Lysander here? Cyprian. This is the man. Â«ClaÂ»udius. Souldan, this is the heir of Antioch. Souldan. I know it, and his names Eugenius; At 2. years ould by spies he was surpriz'd, and brought my father who did change his name, and kept him from the knowledge of himselfe. Lysander. As you haue likewise done; and made me spoyle my countrey, kill my kinred; heau'n forgiue me. Claudius. Twas too much wrong; therfore restore to him his kingdome Souldan. Souldan. Since it must be so, Eugenius take thy kingdom backe againe; and with it (as a recompence of wrong done to thee) take this iewell of thy life, and the sole heir of Egypts diadem, Miranda. let my faults be all forgot sander &amp; Miranda. Great sir, our voyce of thanckes shall drown their crie. Claudius. [Why this is] Souldan in this thou hast done [[illeg.]] worthyly. Colactus. The Gods be prays'd that the victorious faire Miranda is thus fortunately found. Miranda. O, Lord Colactus, though you found me not in way of search, you felt me in the feild. Colactus. I blesse my wounds since from your hand they came. Miranda. y'had been more blessed, had you mist the same. The Gods graunt that phlebotomie may cure you of the fauning sicknes. This while Clitophon presents Iustina to the Califfe, &amp; they whisper, kindly embracing. Califfe. pardon [sweet] fair one. And [now] Clitophon, now take her once againe with my vnfayned loue. Iustina. No mightie Sir, my virgin life is vow'd to heauen now which hath so oft preserv'd it. All this is private disc betwixt Lys Clitophon, I and Cyprian The rest [[illeg.]] to minde Clitophon. Happy maide, [asside while] Thy vow displeases not, and thy strange story hath wonne my heart to lay hould on thy faith. Lysander. Cyprian turn'd Christian! Cyprian. Yes Eugenius. Lysander. You and Iustina shall along with mee to Antioch: while I haue pow'r, you both Shall there be safe from rage of persecution. Clitophon. Where ere Iustina goes, thither will I; but not at once. Ile follow secretly. Iustina. Then heau'n has heard my pray'r and Clitophon Is happyly become a Christian. Claudius. Souldan of Egypt, Califfe of Babilon, And King of Antioch, ioyne your princely hands. Thus in Romes name I knit a frendly league twixt you three princes: may this gordian knot nere be vntied[,] againe, nor by warre cut. All three. We wish the same. Califfe. Then princes since to loue our quarrells are converted, ere wee part enter the wondrous walls of Babilon, and taste our entertaine. Claudius. Califfe content, I oft haue wish'd to see faire Babilon, whose mighty walls are reckon'd vp by ffame for one of the [nine worth] seau'n wonders. Ope thy gates thou happie towne, and entertayne thy frends; such are all these now; enmitie here ends. Exeunt. Finis.</field>
