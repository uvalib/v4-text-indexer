      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —An Eminence commanding the Sea, in the eastern extremity of Fife. Seer and Attendant. SEER. Guide me, O friend, to where the loftiest point, Marring the level of this land of Fife, O'erlooks the broadest circuit of the main; A sight is there I am ordain'd to see, And weep, and cry aloud upon. ATTENDANT. Stand here; This is the place;—cast eastward hence thine eyes;— Lo! Ocean spread before thee in her huge Out-scooped basin of world-washing waves; Here seen embarr'd by her bare belt of rocks, Yonder far off mingling insensibly With heaven's great span of blue, that sea from sky Cannot by sight be sunder'd. SEER. So man's life Is at the present broken and barr'd in By the harsh rocks of daily misery, Whereon his passing peace is ever dash'd; But in the distant future mingles down Insensibly with heaven, till heaven and life Seem one, alike eternal and serene. What seest thou yonder? Strain thine eyes athwart The floods; haply thy young eye's nerve may note Low on th'horizon's uttermost confine Some mote which mine, by sorrow's mists o'er-run, May not discern. ATTENDANT. There's nought upon the deep Save the white crests of waves that the eastern wind Whips sportfully into small curls of foam, As o'er their heaving and unnumber'd tops He gallops in his gladness to the shore. SEER. O name not gladness, for that word to-day Is banish'd from the rich dawn-cradling east; The morn may from her sapphire chambers come, Besprinkling all the universe with beams; But joy comes not for Scotland! Yet dost thou See nothing? ATTENDANT. I behold a puny point, A pin-head of dim dusk, dimensionless, Far in the east, even in the act of birth From very nothing. SEER. Turn thine eye now southward;— What seest thou there? ATTENDANT. I see a darksome cloud Up-steaming from the bowels of the sea In haste to meet the sun, and twine itself About his sheeny and meridian horns, And muffle him in sables. SEER. Ay,—'tis so; I know it well; I knew it should be so; The germ of black misfortune bourgeons now, And swells with death just just about to break:— Once more look tow'rd the east;—Has that dim point As yet evolv'd and clear'd itself into Distinguishable shape of diving hulk, Tall mast, and curved sail? ATTENDANT. Methinks it does; I see a gallant frigate marching on As if instinct with living glee, her sails Bolstering th'up-hoisted yards, and her huge hull In blackness all distinct. SEER. 'Tis she; 'tis she; Black, black, tomb-black as the calamitous And dismal freight she is surcharged with! Disaster rides upon her rolling mast; The moon-ey'd moping Melancholy sits Astern, and hardly guides her erring helm; Black-stoled Grief presides upon the prow, Making her ever and anon duck down For tears into the saltish floods below! I see the vesture that so late did pall A maiden's corse, now topmost-high unroll'd, Wreathing its dusky deathful drapery Within th'embraces of the flapping wind: O thou dull symbol of announced death! O vessel, vessel, would I could not see thee! Would but the western wind arise and blow Thy dead unwhisper'd tidings with thee back Into the unopen'd chambers of the east! Alas, thou struttest on with stately pomp, As if in pride presenting to our shores The gallantry of mourning thou hast on! Like simple child following his mother's bier, Proud in his sables and long-flowing crapes:— Thou comest,—and I weep; and all our land, Awaked to bitter consciousness, shall weep, Dating her troublous period from what time Thy sullen hulk o'er-peers above the sea: O thou dear, dreary, queen-bereaved land! Tears, many tears await thee, more than those Big drops of rain that now conglobe beneath The muffled sun, to fall upon thy soil, Mix'd with the lightning's grisly arrow'd bolts;— Hark, hark, the thunder rolls, and o'er the Frith Growls his tempestuous trumpet-peal; fit note T'upstart the land to anguish, and prelude The storms and bloody turbulence of men! Enough: I see, I hear it all; O mouth, Be silent now; tear-pregnant eyes now speak, Tears are the comeliest language for the time! SCENE II. —Between Balcomie Castle and the Sea-shore. Enter Sir Michael Scot and Sir David Wemyss, as just landing from shipboard; with them Duncan, Earl of Fife, Archbishop Fraser, and Sir John Cuming. FRASER. Five weeks have we been lingering by the shore, From hill and turret that command the sea Watchful of each uncertain speck that rose Afloat upon the horizon's fluid ring, Our eyes interpreting it into the bark Joy-freighted, dancing onward to our shores, Rich with the jewel of Queen Margaret. Alas, thus has your ship arriv'd at last Gloomy and coffin-black with death, her sails And streamers of the dun disastrous pall That mantled the Norwegian maiden's corse! SIR DAVID WEMYSS. Alas, alas! we are unwillingly The heralds of affliction; would to God Th'unpitying deep had swallow'd us in mercy, And with our life had choked our utterance, That other lips than ours had been the first T'announce our country's terrible bereavement! EARL OF FIFE. O heavy news for Scotland! never came To our sweet shores a ship so melancholy, To chill with disappointment all the land, And blast it suddenly from joy to grief. SIR JOHN CUMING. Ha, dead! how pregnant is that little word! [Aside. SIR MICHAEL SCOT. Even from the first, methought the elements Warr'd inauspiciously against our voyage: Ere we attain'd the port of Elsinore, Three perilous and blustering weeks were past Amid the tossings of the eastern deep; The skies seem'd surly with hostility, Lest we should foot th'unwilling land before The spirit of our gentle Queen was gone; For she had died the morning of the day Whereon we landed; and we found her, not A joyous queen, bedeck'd with marriage-robes, To welcome us to palace-banquetings; But a poor corpse trimm'd out for burial, Her bridemaids changed to mourners round her bier, And her bereaved father sitting lone Amid his chamber, inconsolable, Forbidding us to see th'excess of grief That did unking his lofty royalty. ARCHBISHOP FRASER. O Haquo, Haquo, doleful was the day That broke thy aged heart, and snapp'd asunder The golden chain of life that bound thee to us! Thou art left desolate and childless; we An orphan people; both alike in tears! SIR MICHAEL SCOT. And when we left the Norway land, to bear The message home which death gave us to carry, Again the spirit of the skies was up Against our voyage, and assail'd our masts With angry squalls, that seem'd to flout at us For wafting home so terrible a tale; Thrice did our ship, when half-way o'er the flood, Rebound before the thwartings of the west Into the harbour whence she sail'd before: At last, sea-batter'd, and consumed with storm, Watchings, and fast, we re-salute our land, Though late, alas! too soon, afflicting it, By our arrival and our first few words, Into a speechless, helpless, endless sorrow. EARL OF FIFE. I see, I see in this woe-pregnant death A cloud of mischief, as a man's hand small, Low in the horizon of futurity, Which soon dilating up into our sky Will drench poor Scotland with a bloody rain. In Marg'ret's grave, our Alexander's name And line is buried; and the Scottish crown Now lies unown'd, a disputable thing, To be tugg'd for by hot competitors, In fields where bitter and confronting factions Will congregate, and roll into themselves The pith of all the land, to settle it With swords in bloody barb'rous controversy. ARCHBISHOP FRASER. Heaven's mercy interpose itself to save Our country from that fearful termination! In Heaven alone is remedy; for man Has in him only all the sinful seeds Of jealousy, and strife, and bad ambition, Which, when contested crowns provoke to sin, Sprout out into the fellest outrages. SIR JOHN CUMING. Beshrew me, but a crown's too rich a pearl Not to be dived for through a sea of blood; He is a weakling, and affronts his sires, Rebelling 'gainst the blood his veins inherit, That will not doff his subject garb, and dip For royalty, were't to the ocean's bottoms!— My cousin Baliol at this woeful news, I hope, will brisk him like a cockerel up, And fire his every feather with ambition: If he be slack, I'll dash for it myself Some pretty enterprise.—But we let sleep The news too long;—I'll be myself the post To Galloway, to greet my grieving coz With advertisement of the maiden's death. [Exit Sir John. ARCHBISHOP FRASER. It works already; hardly hath the grief Just grazed upon the surface of our hearts, When the vile sleeping asp of emulation, That lurks within, reanimates and stirs, Rejoicing in the tears that quicken him. Cuming is gone, and bears upon his lips Words that will sicken Scotland, but excite To bustling hopes the race of Huntington. SIR MICHAEL SCOT. Let us within, my friends; for much our hearts Need to be 'stablish'd by good household cheer From stomach-qualms and dizzyings of the wave; We'll talk then of our voyage more at large, And of the joyless prospects of this land. SCENE III. —Castle in Galloway. Enter Lady Donagill and Lady Marjory Cuming. LADY DONAGILL. This peevish wind, that puffs so sharp from th'east, Has blown into our western nook to-day Strange rumours, that cause tingle both my ears: Ere I was well awake this morn, there stood Beneath my casement, in the dusk of dawn, An obscure half-distinguishable form, That cry'd aloud, Wake, Lady Donagill! Wake to thy grandeur! for the maid is dead That stood between high royalty and thee! And I have heard it rattled from the tongues Of gypsies and tale-telling vagabonds All day who have caress'd my castle-gate, That stirring news, rejoicing to our house, Come marching merrily from yon dull east. LADY MARJORY CUMING. It is the idle wind that generates Upon the clouds such babbled vanities, And fly-blows all the rotten public ear With shapeless maggots of absurd reports; Trust them not, sister; were there sooth in them, They'd not been carry'd by the courier wind, Sir John had borne them on his trustier lip. LADY DONAGILL. Ay, but it haps oftimes that the dull crowd, Inexplicably sensitive, do catch The coming issues of yet-lab'ring fate. I will not trust them; yet my aug'ring heart Belies me much if they be fabulous. Enter Sir John Cuming. SIR JOHN. Ha, spouse, bonjour! my Lady Donagill Brisk up—now spread your peacock feathers wide; The Norway maid is dead, whose slender life, Though but a breath, was as a brazen wall To barricade our house from royalty: She's dead—and all our hopes are now alive! LADY DONAGILL. Marg'ret of Norway dead! What mighty issues For me, and my De Baliol, and yourself, Hang on these short and soon-announced news! Ah! the poor lady dead?—Pray, did she die A-bed at home, or hammock'd in your ship?— I grieve for Marg'ret, for men say she was A goodly, promising, kind-hearted girl;— And yet th'inheritors of crowns will die, And to their kinsfolk leave their heritage.— Where, where art thou, my John De Baliol?— These news affect thee;—I will bless thee with them.— Sir John, Sir John, excuse a mother's zeal. [Exit Lady Donagill. LADY MARJORY CUMING. To Baliol only do these news pertain? Husband, has not the Cuming name also A spice of blessed royalty within it? I think it sounds and syllables as well As your De Baliol; and some poor nine months Make up my sister's vain priority;— A poor nine months, a particle of time! The infant which it fashions may e'en span it; In a long life it is not worth the naming; Pity such preference, Sir John, should hang Upon a trifle. SIR JOHN CUMING. Yea, 'tis pity, dame, You are not older; I'd have liked to see Some dozen or two of excellent hoar hairs Up bristling on your head their privilege Of primogeniture o'er sister Donagill, Whose cheeks and tresses would to God they were All sleek and golden with the light of youth, Confounding you with useless victory! Then had I pick'd a pretty diadem Out of the rubbish of your hoary hairs. LADY MARJORY CUMING. Talk not, dear Cuming, of what might have been; We have enow realities, whereon To rear our claims, which if but weak disjoin'd, Yet clasp'd and interwov'n with one another, Will give and gather strength unmatchable; Like two fair trees that on the upland's height, By interlacing their united boughs, Shoot up the taller to affront the wind, And overtop their brethren of the wood By their conjunction. SIR JOHN CUMING. Good, my dame, thou meanest— LADY MARJORY CUMING. I mean that Huntington's rich blood is in me, Arousing me to shout unto the world That I do heir it not unconsciously;— I mean, that I am also link'd to blood That has been sluiced out from the royal stream, From Fergus floating downwards to our days. Does Cuming now forget his ancestry From Donald Bane? I've heard him boast of it Vain-gloriously at table, 'mong his guests, When no need was, sith pretty Marg'ret liv'd; Now that there's need, sith pretty Marg'ret's dead, 'Twill vantage him to rake and furbish up That time-obscured lineage, whereby he May fortify with superadded claim What may be slender in his lady's title. SIR JOHN CUMING. True—Donald Bane, whom Malcolm's bastard son Ejected from his throne for eighteen months, Compelling him to roam the western isles, And feed on unboil'd limpets from the rocks, Till he with brib'd Macpendir bounded out From his Æbudan hiding-place, and slew The Bastard at Monteith, and, crown'd again, Once more digested royal delicates. He left a daughter, Bethok, who did leave A daughter, Hexild, who did leave a son, Who left— LADY MARJORY CUMING. Hold, Cuming, hold, I know it all, Trunk, scion, branch, and bud in your huge tree Of boasted pedigree; the priest we hear On Sunday's in our Abbey, does not know So well his pater-noster's six petitions, As I your five descents from Donald White: 'Twill do, Sir John; but blab it not henceforth In mine, so much as in your country's ears; Convince the people, and march off for Scoon. SIR JOHN CUMING. My nephew most, your elder sister's son, I fear, this Baliol lad, who'll try to scrape A preference from his mother's eldership. LADY MARJORY CUMING. Mark, if De Bruce will mince or hesitate, Because his mother is a younger birth, T'erect his claims o'er sister Donagill, And me, the children of the elder daughter. If he forbear, thou may'st; if he set up Against his cousins of the senior branch, Thou may'st with equal confidence obtrude Thy equal rights, and pester and confound Their competitions with upheaped claims. SIR JOHN CUMING. We must admonish, then, and rouse our friends. LADY MARJORY CUMING. Ay, let Monteith, and Mar, and Buchan, now Be stirred up to royalise their name, And push it up to grandeur. SIR JOHN CUMING. This resolved, We must, as caution dictates, instantly Make preparation for our going hence: One castle cannot in its bounded walls Contain th'unbounded and ambitious souls Of royalty's twin-candidates. LADY MARJORY CUMING. Yea, such In the same hall can't elbow one another; They must expatiate, and have room to jar Abroad from territorial bound to bound, Like meteors in free sky. SIR JOHN CUMING. Let us then Make ready, and be bustling for the business;— Hands must not sleep, if heads affect a crown. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. —Another Room in the Castle. Enter Lady Donagill and John Baliol. LADY DONAGILL. The maid is dead, my son, whose slender life Dissever'd thee from royalty. BALIOL. Woe, woe For our bereaved land, at these sad news! LADY DONAGILL. If it is woe for Scotland, it is well For thee, John Baliol, and thy family; Blew ne'er a wind so boisterous and barren But some rich wreck came hulling to the shores, Which most it batters with its surly surge. BALIOL. 'Twill be a wreck, I fear me, with these realms.— Sweet Marg'ret dead! and with her all the hopes That blossom'd thick around her precious life, Blown off, and perish'd in the rotting grave! How will the English Edward grieve to hear Her death, that was betroth'd his daughter-queen! Whose life, had God prolong'd it, would have soon Solder'd into one great glad monarchy These kingdoms, that have stood aloof too long, Scornfully butting with their horns of pride Each at the other's proud defying front: I thought to see them wedded happily, And that false, forged, erroneous frontier-line, Which honest-hearted Nature never meant, But warring brothers traced with bloody streaks, Erazed eternally, and joyous flowers Covering the ravaged bounds, and cancelling The blood of ages with the bloom of peace:— Alas, these hopes are perish'd, or adjourn'd To latest generations after us; And we must see Contention yet again Rise from that grave, where long he has been buried, The fiercer from long languor, to embroil The passive people with soul-vexing feuds. LADY DONAGILL. Frett'st thou, De Baliol, at what God hath done? Death's issues are all his; nor hath he will'd That England's King should over-lord it now From sea to sea, engrossing all the isle Beneath his southern sceptre's tyranny. He wills Earl David's heir, thy father's son, Should catch the crown that now descends to him, And wear it stoutly in his mother's right. Else shall his mother, in her right's defence, Shaking off strengthless age and sex infirm, Assume the spirit that should fire her son, And to her temples challenge sovereignty. BALIOL. Ne'er shall Earl David's and great Roland's heir Deserve his mother's reprehension so, By trembling to receive the golden gift Bequeath'd him from his noble ancestry. No—I should fail to thee, myself, and God, By a faint-hearted sneaking from the glory, And coying off, with worse than cowardice, Th'hereditary honour from my head. LADY DONAGILL. There, there, my son, speaks royally in thee, Earl David's spirit, glimmering forth a glimpse Even through the softness of thy nature's mould, Of kingly mettle bottom'd in thy heart: Rouse, then, thy prouder nature; put it forth In open deed, and challenge to the world Of what is thine from God and from thy mother:— David of Huntington, my grandsire, was King William Lion's brother, and begat Three daughters only, whereof Margaret, My mother, was the eldest, so that now King William's progeny extinct, thou art, In virtue of thy mother's right and mine, The fam'ly's lineal representative, And rightful owner of the crown: De Bruce, My cousin, though with me co-equal in Degree and distance from our race's root, Is but the younger daughter's son, and thence In claim as in descent subordinate To you, descended from the senior branch. BALIOL. De Bruce, I fear me, will not less put up His plausible pretensions to perplex My better rights, and captivate the crowd Into his faction. LADY DONAGILL. Let him cast about, And try to catch the people with mean arts, That only prove his insecurity. Thy footing is secure, and stablish'd firm Upon hereditary rights and usage, Which are too weighty to be blown aside By the poor puff of any rabble's breath. Muster thy friends in Scotland and in France, Address our States, and clamour in their ears Thy preference; let Edward's ear be twitch'd With words conducive to thy benefit. Even Philip may be hinted to, and help Away with obstacles. BALIOL. I'll advise anon With all our friends, and, by prevention, try To win opinion. LADY DONAGILL. Instantly;—for Bruce, More rapid in his bearing, will be flying Abroad on expedition's every wing, To give the thoughts of men their first impulse, And curry with the simple populace. Away then, John De Baliol, to the work Of kingdom-courting:—craft and diligence Are needful for up-scrambling to a throne. [Exit Baliol. LADY DONAGILL , (sola.) He is too softly-virtuous, this my son; His soul has not enough of sinew in her, Whereon to ground resolve; yet whensoever He is excited by some rousing voice, He plucks up kingly heart, and slides again Into his kindred's magnanimity. Therefore he must be baited and provoked To embrace the glory, else his soul, abandon'd To her soft self, will droop and dwindle down T'ambitionless content:—He must be king; That is his destiny; that hath been impress'd Upon my heart by signs and auguries Of fortune-tellers and astrologers, Even from the day my knees received him first. Albeit he seem too gentle and too weak To brawl a stormy competition out, That weakness shall his mother's strength supply; I'll be his counsellor, his setter-on, His heartner in the chase of royalty, That, as his blood derives from me the right, He from his mother too may catch the vigour T'invest him in that birth-right's privilege. SCENE V. —Garden of Lord Bruce's Castle in Lochmaben. Enter Lord Robert Bruce and Martha his Countess. LORD BRUCE. My lady all mind-stricken with a dream! Fy on it, dame!—the minds of cottagers, That sleep in ragged and uncurtain'd pallets, May be afeard at visions of the night, That through the crannies of their mud-built walls Are sifted in with Heaven's nocturnal wind, To persecute their simple brains with terrors; But ladies, that do sleep in golden couches, Amid embroider'd coverlets and curtains, To be so pester'd with such vulgar frights— Fie on the folly! MARTHA. O my lord, 'tis not The poor straw-pallet that does most attract These gilded wasps of persecuting fancy; On beds of state and purple canopies, Drawn by the glare they light, to sting within The high-born sleepers with fantastic pangs. 'Tis but a brain-born vanity, and yet Its airy misery is not felt the less. LORD BRUCE. Give us the figment, good my lady-dreamer; I hope some dreary part of it is mine, That I may show some heart in bearing up Against its black abodements manfully. MARTHA. Methought I was a-walking with my lord, As now we do in our fair garden here; The skies were flooded round from rim to rim, As with a boundless sea of summer shine; Around us our dear children, with their cousins, Were playing on the rose-befringed walks, With shouts and merry pranks of younker glee, As in their jolly school-days they were wont; And I was plucking lilies where they grew, Tall nodding to the sun their paramour; When all at once, as I put out my hand To crop one of the fairest, there up rose, In lieu of it, a prickly dangerous plant, Surmounted by a crown, which well I knew: Back, back I started, from that spectacle; My hand abhorr'd the smiling invitation; I shrunk; but round it, keenly clust'ring, came Children and cousins, whose sweet childish mood Of pastime now was poison'd and perverted Into a wrathful burning emulation, That madden'd each against the other's life; Then, then methought the sky wax'd dim and dimmer, And shrouded up his silver face with clouds Up-racking black as from the mouth of hell. Heaven, earth, and men, as if in sympathy, Partook of our commotion, till there dropt From the sick firmament an ugly dew, A dark, dim drizzle of disastrous blood, Which lay upon my garments heavily. I shook it from my garments off in terror; And I beheld our garden cover'd thick With ghastly shapes of death, my children slain, And half my kindred bleeding mortally; Even then I heard some angel-voice on high Round heaven's dusk cope resounding, “Fear not, lady! A remnant shall be pluck'd from this destruction, To make thee mother of a hundred kings!” And I awoke, alarmed at that cry. LORD BRUCE. Tush, lady!—Here's a tail of consolation, Tack'd to the body of this boding vision; 'Tis as an ugly comet, dusk with blood, Whose tail is bright as silvery Mercury, Illuming stronger than the body dims. Cheer up, my Lady Carrick; there is hope Amid the horrors of your fantasy, Albeit it be but brain-born vapour all.— But who comes here, so booted and so spurr'd, Torrid with haste? Enter Sir William Dishington. Sir William of Ardross! How now, good knight?—What unexpected hap Hath blown you on the whirlwind to our shire? Is our Queen landed?—Has St Andrew's pier As yet been kissed by her silver slipper? SIR WILLIAM DISHINGTON. Lord Bruce, our Queen is dead!—Alas! the grave Hath gaped upon her virgin innocence, And swallow'd all our hopes! MARTHA. Ah! woe the while, Poor pretty Margaret dead, and in her grave!— Said'st thou not wrong, Sir William? I do hope Thy tongue did stumble.—O, unspeak thy words, And bless us with confession of mistake! SIR WILLIAM DISHINGTON. I saw the pall-black ship that brought the news Gloomily anchor'd by Balcomie shore; Her decks were silent as a funeral; The seamen shouted not that row'd her in; Their faces, wet with weeping, were averted From their own much-beloved land, as if They had no heart, no liking, to approach And stun her with the dread intelligence; I heard the tidings falter'd from the lips Of those who saw our coffin'd queen let down Into the greedy and remorseless tomb; She's gone, and leaves poor lonesome Scotland weeping Through all her valleys and her thousand hills! MARTHA. Ah, beauteous blossom, too, too delicate To bide the bite of Norway's bitter blast! Thine should have been a clime more merciful, To fan thy beauty with a balmy breeze, And bless us with thy ripen'd excellence! Alas! I had a gift prepared for thee, Sew'd by my hand, and blossom'd bright with gold, Awaiting thine arrival in our land; Now, it must lie conceal'd within its coffer, Disown'd for ever by the hand that wrought it; The moths and worms of death that prey upon Thy bury'd beauty, shall appropriate, too, And ravage its designed ornament. Ah, cruel, partial Death! to seize upon The beauteous just-appearing bud of youth, And leave the aged, those who court a grave, Hanging upon the wither'd tree of life To drop upon the dust from rottenness! LORD BRUCE. Queen Margaret dead!—Ha!—Alexander's line Extinct and in the dust! Now—now—The crown? Whose is the crown?—Ah me—what piteous tidings!— Death never from the palace of existence Purloin'd a gem of life so precious:— The crown?—Am I not Isabella's son, Earl David's grandson?—Mine—'tis surely mine.— My cousin, Donagill, with whom I stand In like degree of distance from Earl David, Though born of th'elder daughter, cannot plead, Being female, claims like mine; and what she has, Feeble herself, must feebler be, transmitted To her but feeble son, John Baliol. 'Tis mine, Sir William. MARTHA. O, my lord, my lord, Let the grief die, and sob itself away, Ere Emulation fret herself to life; Think on thy country, all at once bereaved, And dash'd into confusion at one stroke; But yesterday she sat upon her hill, Exulting in her gaudiest robes of joy, In expectation to keep holiday, And shout a sounding welcome to her Queen: To-day she, with her widow's wimple on, Loathing the sunlight, shut and tombs herself Within her darkest cavern, where she sits A-sighing for her poor dead Margaret;— And I, with her, must weep for Margaret: Ah, sorrow, sorrow!—Poor dead Margaret! [Exit Martha. LORD BRUCE. So—grief must have its way; 'tis honourable Unto the living to bewail the dead: Yet we must live, Sir William; men can't make A meal on tears, and diet on dry sobs; Above the grave, we must be trampling on it As if disdainfully, and meditating High schemes of life, and of prosperity, Honour, and fame, in a forgetful scorn Of all the shrouds and coffins cramm'd below. The crown, Sir William? What think'st thou of it? This sad demise will set a-bustling all Earl David's progeny; but yet I think The preference is ours; the nearest male I to the stock; Hastings will never stir; John Baliol only through his mother boasts A poor pretension, more remote than mine By one degree; his mother's claim I have In point of distance of descent, but stronger By preference of sex. SIR WILLIAM DISHINGTON. It must be yours, As David's nearest heir; the country's voice I hope will have it so; the House of Carrick, Warm in the people's love, will thence derive O'erbalance of advantage great enough T'outweigh the shyer Baliol, to whose name The multitude are cold and phlegmatic. LORD BRUCE. The States must of necessity convene, On this our country's dismal deprivation, To counsel for her weal, and ratify In this dire blank and void of sov'reignty, The crown's succession to the rightful heir. Be it our business to pre-occupy And ravish to ourselves, by loving-kindness, As well as bold enforcement of our plea, Men's minds, that ere the Parliament be met, The bias may be given too generally, Too strongly, to be thwarted, or oppugn'd: Thus shall we best effectuate our scheme Of soaring up to royalty, for the which My temples, though time-batter'd they do seem, Sown prematurely with some snowy specks, Shall not unfit be proved, but bear the weight Gloriously; giving a contrasted grace, Even by their partial and precursive whiteness, To the bright gemmed gold that sits upon them. SCENE VI. —Parliament House in Edinburgh. Macduff Earl of Fife, Sir David Wemyss, Sir Michael Scot, Archbishop Fraser, Baliol, Bruce, and other Lords, as met for deliberation. EARL OF FIFE. To what conclusion come we then, my lords? Or, find we no release, our wits, forsooth, After the brangling of some dozen hours, Empuzzled and entangled more and more, 'Mid such beguiling contrarieties? SIR DAVID WEMYSS. Between the Lords De Baliol and De Bruce Seems now the competition to be narrow'd: But so perplexing are their urged claims, So dang'rous were an over-quick decision, That one day's diet cannot well suffice To pass a judgment, which for ages must Affect afflicted Scotland, and perhaps Be summon'd up against our memories, As an unsafe, imprudent precedent. Adjourn we then, till Time, that teaches all, Instruct us better in this weighty cause. SIR MICHAEL SCOT. I fear me, Scotland never can herself Herein decide unbiass'd, and with safety: We are so wound by prejudice together, So intertwisted by the ties of blood, So hamper'd in from free arbitrement, By all our native partialities, That right opinion scarcely can o'erbear The press of prejudice that pushes on her What then we, from the truth diverted so By favour, cannot honestly determine, Let us commit to one, who, far aloof, And purify'd by distance from these frailties, Can arbitrate according to the right, And with authority enforce his dictate. ARCHBISHOP FRASER. To Edward let us tender the decision; He is the proper umpire; and to him, Close wedded to us by long years of peace, By present sympathy and share of loss, In this bereavement of our blessed Queen, To him, whose honour and unblamed discretion Match his unmatched prowess in rough arms, We may with safety delegate the trust Of choosing from the noble candidates: He has no interest to weigh him down In prepossession towards either side; Truth and the laws alone will shape his choice; And whom his wisdom chooses, can his power Protect from rival's disappointed grudge. Then, whoso trusteth that his claim is just, Let him submit to this just umpirage, Acknowledging submission by assent; Whoso distrusts let him in silence pass Hence to the shelter of his partisans, And trust to faction rather than to right. JOHN BALIOL. My Lords, I do acknowledge this proposal As emanating fair from equity; And I should manifest a mean distrust Of what I deem my right's validity, By hesitation to accede thereto:— Let Edward arbitrate on Scotland's crown! LORD BRUCE. May my claims perish in deserved contempt, If, being fearless of their falsity, I should be fearful to commit to one, Holding with equal hands Decision's balance, Determination of this high dispute.— Let Edward arbitrate on Scotland's crown! EARL OF FIFE. Here then it rests, my lords; and in this close, Unanimous at last, we shut our counsels: To Edward let us instantly dispatch A delegation of our primest nobles, Instructed to adjure him by all ties Of blood that bind him to our royal race, Of friendship, whereby to our nation's heart He is incorporate in sweet affection, That of his grace he would, for the dear sake Of otherwise distracted, warring Scotland, Adjudge, according to his princely wisdom, Our crown to whomsoe'er of these he finds Possess'd of indefeasible true right. Thus shall we 'scape by happy compromise The dangers else ensuing to our state; And Scotland, happy in her gratitude, Receive from him a father and a king:— Be then our court dissolved on this conclusion;— To-morrow we shall choose commissioners To carry to fair England our resolves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —Sir John Cuming's Castle in Badenoch. Sir John Cuming, Lady Marjory Cuming. SIR JOHN CUMING. Edward is coming, dear; he's on his way, With Anthony de Bek, and all his lords, And the pick'd wits of learning-larded France, With all their garniture of wigs and gowns, Strutting with law and with theology: Northumberland is groaning 'neath the weight Of learned bellies lumbering toward the North; Tyne mutters to the Tweed the coming troop, And Tweed shrinks in, and sweats with apprehension At being drunk up by their multitude. LADY MARJORY CUMING. I trow, the river needs not be alarm'd; The learned drink no water in their wine. SIR JOHN CUMING. Tut, tut, they're primed and charged to the mouth, Like culverins, all ready to fire out The world-amazing crack of their decision; We'll hear it here at Badenoch; 'twill blow Down to the dust our steeple-lofty hopes: They're coming, lady, to suppress the Cuming. LADY MARJORY CUMING. What! may King Donald Bane's great name avail not? Shall English royalty and Gallic law Trample on his terrific memory? SIR JOHN CUMING. Ay, good King Donald, with his daughter Bethok, And Hexild, and the rest—I mickle dread, Kick'd from all hopes, their grandchildren may pack To live on limpets on poor Barra's rock, As did their great dethroned progenitor: Why—we're all shoulder'd out of sov'reignty By this strange shoal of raw-born candidates. King Ned had undertaken to reduce The number two to one, but in that stead He has, like Cadmus, sown the serpent's teeth, And up the golden-helmed bloody crop Of brethren rise, with faces grim as hell, Mad to be murder'd all, and flourishing Their fratricidal crackling arms on high, To hew each other down into the dust, That spawn'd their reg'ment but a trice before. LADY MARJORY CUMING. What spick-and-span fresh claimants are a-field? SIR JOHN CUMING. A dainty round half-dozen at the least;— There's Florence, Earl of Holland, who hath hoisted Some twenty thousand trowser'd Dutch aboard His timber-floats, that can exhibit him On the fourth morn beside the pier of Leith: He first and fearfullest—There's Sir John Hastings; Sir Nicholas Foulis; Sir Roger Mandeville; Patrick Dunbar, our kinsman Earl of March; Sir Walter Ross; and to befringe the list With beauteous bastardy, Sir William Vessie, Who now proclaims, as with the sound of trump, His mother was not given to harlotry, But litter'd him according to the canon, In blameless blankets, most authentically: Think'st thou that Donald Bane's sweet memory Can thrive, or not be smother'd down to death By such a squeeze of upstarts? LADY MARJORY CUMING. Bad it bodes Not for the Cuming only, but the country, That Edward, honour'd with that reference, Should multiply dissensions by up-swarming A mob of such unvouched candidates. SIR JOHN CUMING. Mass, dame, 'tis true; I ever augur'd ill Of England's intermeddling in this cause. What! is our country too unwise, too weak, To settle of herself her fireside quarrels; But she must gad abroad in discontent, Seeking some foreign daysman to come in With proud arbitrement, inviting him To domineer and scowl on each pretence? Must Europe's law and learning be scraped up From her broad surface, to determine here Whose is th'arm-chair at Scoon? 'Tis just as if Goodman and wife should have a bit of bicker, And each should pettishly gad round the town, Beseeching honest burghers to come in And solve the strife 'twixt smock and pantaloon. Hark ye, good Marjory, the Scottish States That day gave all their wisdom to the wind, When they surrender'd to a stranger's hand The right of nomination to their throne; We'll hear o't with a racket by and by. Meantime, my dame, we must be ducking down Our heads into humility, full glad In being of King Donald's stirp, without His chance of kingdom or of limpet-soup. Let Bruce and Baliol battle out the broil; Keep we at home, and wear our happy heads In quiet near the hearth. LADY MARJORY CUMING. Nay, but, dear, 'Tis hard to wake poor subjects, after dreaming Of kinging it so very joyously. SIR JOHN CUMING. Yea, but 'tis harder, after having dream'd Of wearing paper-crowns, and pseudo-jewels, And feeding indigestibly on peacocks, To wake on Barra's barren rock with nought But an old blanket to protect from cold, And only periwinkles for a breakfast: These were King Donald's darling miseries, All which he hugg'd, and mounted by their means Into the chair, whereon a day or two He monarchised it in a merry mood, Till scoundrel Edgar pluck'd him by the nose, And dosed him that he died. LADY MARJORY CUMING. May God forefend To us such doleful thronings, and dethronings! SIR JOHN CUMING. Ay, dame, 'tis better here, at Badenoch, Fattening on pease, than in a dizzy court Emaciating on peacocks, with a head Tottering upon your shoulders, and a crown Twice tottering on that head, neither your own, But ready to be hewn, or hurried off By interlopers. LADY MARJORY CUMING. Rest we then at ease, Nestling in th'obscure happiness of home; It is at least the safest. SIR JOHN CUMING. As 'tis wisest, T'extort from crabbed sour necessity Some sap of comfort.—We'll be lookers-on,— Idle ourselves, upon the scrambling strife: So, go to,—dame, get us a feast of pease, And peace;—leave royal cates and cares to others: Go to—go to—let us be merry, Marjory! SCENE II. —Berwick. Enter King Edward and Anthony De Bek. KING EDWARD. What news, De Bek? Are now these northern lords And honourable burgesses all met, Towards my kingly coming? What's their cheer? Look they as cross and uncomplaisant As at the church of Norham, where I got Such sour reply and gloominess of brows? DE BEK. Ten days, my liege, they have been waiting here, With murmurs all the while at your delay; I have observed them, and have watch'd their words Betokening no submission or compliance; Their faces, as they enter'd Berwick gate, Seem'd scowling at the stones with discontent, As if they said, We have no business here; We are poor fools thus to be led about Like dancing-dogs by England; and, e'er since, I have o'erheard them as I walk'd the streets Mutt'ring big burly words of Independence, And Scotland's lordship, how she is as free Of England as the quick and skittish wind Is of the quagmire that she skims along, Tossing her tall slim rushes in contempt. KING EDWARD. Ha, mort de Dieu! Is't so?—I liked not, truly, The audacious bearing of these northern churls, When they confronted me at Norham church, With brows as over-lordly as mine own: I ask'd submission, and they gave me scorn; When I required their joint acknowledgment Of England's vouch'd superiority, As necessary act preliminary To farther process in their settlement, They set their faces up as if to heaven, With saucy speech; saying, I ask'd a thing Illegal, which if e'er their tongues should yield, Might cancers eat them up e'en from the root, And that to God in heaven, to none beside Their king was subject, nor shall ever borrow A power at second-hand from crowned creature As underling to any king on earth. Whereat displeased, I caused them flit from hence, Like sparrows at an angry schoolboy's shout, And here appointed them a second meeting, Once more to try their mood. DE BEK. Their mood, O Sire, Remains obdurate as their country's rocks; Nor vinegar of threat, nor axe of gold, Has power to mollify or break them down E'er to concede their country's vassalage. I have been sapping round and round their souls With the temptation of bright English angels; As saints do devils, they resist our angels. I have been threatening them with English wrath, But Scottish pride rebuffs me scowl for scowl. In sooth, my liege, it will be hard to deal With such perversity and touchiness, Or tame it into crouching acquiescence. KING EDWARD. Ha, so? St Mary! ere I name their king, He shall confess himself my feudatory; I'll see to that. DE BEK. If then my lord would look For one that will submissively subserve, Giving his gentle spirit to be govern'd, Mark thou the meek competitor, De Baliol. He may submit him to the vassal's bit. If thou would'st overlook and pass by one Whose o'er-imperious mettle would rebel, And wince against the pricks of good authority, Mark thou De Bruce; he has the seeds within him Of obstinate and unobsequious pride; He's not the man for England. KING EDWARD. I know something Of both the men.—But go, De Bek, convene Anon a council in the parish church Of the commissioners of either realm, There to discuss, previous to my decision, Who most to them appears to have the right; And bid the claimants, Bruce and Baliol, Here meet me separately, that I may probe Their secret dispositions thoroughly Ere I declare. [Exit De Bek. KING EDWARD (alone.) What!—Sang de Dieu!—Must I Thus be fobb'd off and fool'd with vanity? St Edward! No—I took not up this task Thus to be disconcerted, baffled, baulked From my original and secret purpose:— For this was I recall'd, and flatter'd off From purging long-vex'd Jewry of the Turk, Whither I was on expedition bent, Following dear glory e'en to the awful spot Where Jesu died—for this, but to preside A shadow of an arbitrator here, O'erlay'd with Peace's cumbrous frock, and reaping, Instead of harvests of wide-waving fame In the rich East, a handful of poor wind Upon the North-west's barren barriers? Marry, no, no— 'Twas not for this I did disband my men, And sunk at once my heaven-saluting banners, And whirl'd me homewards from astonish'd France, And turn'd my back upon the gorgeous East, To plant a king in Scotland, to perk up One that should spurn my lordship, and full soon Steal strength to terrify, and tug me back From future ventures in the Orient: Ay, verily, I should be chronicled A gosling of a king, a sceptred ninny, To travail thus with panting and with sweat For ends so puny and so nugatory:— I'll see to manage better.—Ere exerting My privilege of umpire, I'll take care That he, whom I shall nominate their king, Shall doff the cap of homage to my throne; I'll see it done in manifest clear act, Exposed to glaring sunlight, that henceforth No Scottish king shall mutter doubts about it, But truckle down to me and England's sceptre Till the world's end. Enter De Bek with Lord Bruce. DE BEK. My gracious sovereign, here At your high bidding waits the Lord De Bruce. [Exit De Bek. KING EDWARD. All hail, Lord Bruce, and welcome! LORD BRUCE. Hail, thrice hail To England's king, and happiness for ever Be handmaid in attendance round his throne! KING EDWARD. Thanks, Lord De Bruce, and should a throne be yours, (As who dare prophesy it shall not be?) Heaven grant its canopy be all of joy, As be its bottoms lined with liegemen's love! But thrones are slippery and unsteady things, And ticklish in the winning; wherefore help From some beneficent and powerful hand Is needed for th'attainment; Right itself Is impotent in furious competitions, And needs to be crutch'd up by th'sturdier props Of Interest and Influence. LORD BRUCE. King of England, My claims are known and out upon the world In hot discussion, scarce requiring now A vain enlargement to your royal ear. I am the grandson of the great Earl David, To that high stock the nearest in descent; I pillar all my titles and pretensions On this foundation; and should these fair claims Prove, as I trust, of true validity, O'erweighing others in th'impartial scales Of arbitration poised by your hand, I shall rejoice, O King, t'accept the crown Adjudged to me as rightful heritage: And I shall wear it more exultingly From being tender'd by a hand so honour'd. But should my title be o'erpoised by one Discover'd to be juster, well I know How goodly and how glorious thing it is To be submissive to awarded right; I have it not to learn to be a subject. KING EDWARD. Ay, that is well, De Bruce, and marks a mind Revolving on itself heroically, High hung on Honesty's thrice-noble hinge. But mark, De Bruce,—when Justice is perplex'd With subtle points of hair-breadth nice solution, Wherein Discrimination's eagle eye Is foil'd and puzzled with resemblances, Why, then a grain of favour, a poor mote Of any gracious stuff foreign from justice, Relieves th'inquisitive search-pained eye, Making it fasten with fond predilection On what would otherwise be under-prized: Even so your title, goodly though it seem, And shining out with shows of verity, Might be advantaged by a small adjunct, A precious one, though small, a golden gloss Gilt on its solid substance, wherewithal To rivet down the adjudicator's eye, And win and witch it into prejudice. Think on't, De Bruce; I would your title were Graced with that decoration. LORD BRUCE. Should that bring Upon my name no blot, nothing dishonourable On me or on my country, would I had This commendation to your kingly grace. KING EDWARD. William the Lion, brother of thy grandsire, Th'anointed King of Scotland, deem'd it not A blot upon his name or on his crown, To be what Bruce may be to win his right,— The homager of England. LORD BRUCE. Willingly, As my forefathers knelt, I too shall kneel For Cumberland and the other seigniories Achieved for us in England; heretofore, That homage ne'er has been refused, and now Will not be grudged. KING EDWARD. The Lion did not blush To kneel him down to my great grandsire Harry Ev'n for his crown. LORD BRUCE. That fealty, my lord, Was wrench'd from his extreme necessities, As being a vanquish'd man, and pris'ner fain To catch at any terms for a release: That fealty for ever was disclaim'd By your King Richard; thence confess'd to be A casual and capricious extortion, Not as a right adherent to his crown. King William's oath, unsworn, recanted thus, Leaves Scotland what she was, and aye shall be, Subjected to the God of Heaven alone: And your high majesty commits a wrong On me, and on my country, in requiring, As bargain for our kingly settlement, Surrender so illiberal and slavish. KING EDWARD. De Bruce, De Bruce, think of the price how little, The purchase how immense! LORD BRUCE. The price, O king, Is servitude, which, though in outward act It be but bending of the body's joint, Stamps the whole mind eternally with stain More shameful-foul than flatt'ry can o'ergild. I will not crouch to such an infamy; I will not cringe a thrall, to mount a king; I will not thus abuse, insult my country, And drag her down from th'eminence of glory, On whose illumin'd far-seen tops she sits High-throned, next to the burning sun of heaven: Be my lips blasted ere I own her vassal; Be my hand wither'd ere I sign her vassal: Dry up my joints, shrink, stiffen into death, Ere I do bend the knee to doom her vassal; I'd rather be a hind upon her soil, Ploughing her glorious ridges haughtily, Mean in my state, but mighty in my freedom, Than strut about amid her palaces, Crown'd despicably and ingloriously, Debased, debasing, with the sneaking breath Of mean subjection, tarnishing the domes Where Scotland's monarchs hitherto have walk'd Free in unmaster'd, conscious majesty. This is my answer to your royal grace; If such the terms of royalty, I scorn it, And court a subject's noble littleness Rather than cringe a vassal-monarch so. I leave your highness to deliberate Upon my titles; if they have no weight Disjoin'd from such submission, let them perish; If they be strong, let me on them alone Rise nobly to a yet-unblemish'd throne. [Exit De Bruce. KING EDWARD. There, there is northern mettle, there is stuff Too stubborn stiff e'en to extend a hand For acceptation, or to curve the knee Into becoming shape of thankfulness!— Ev'n let him pack with all his pride about him; Let that up-buoy, and keep aloft his heart With mighty musings, when his humbled head, Bare of th'expected royalty, shall sink Down into shame before some happier rival. We'll find another, oil'd with more compliance, Whose joints, uncramp'd with cold formality, Will be more supple to cow'r down, and be Paid for the kneeling with a diadem. Such starched stiffness will not do for England Be his rights strong as cable, they shall snap As thread before the tug of my displeasure: By this demeanor shall his rival's claim Tenfold be better'd and be beautified;— But here he comes, twin-brother of the claim, Calmer and sweeter, boding tamer things By his aspect. [De Bek enters, with the Lord de Baliol. DE BEK. My liege, I usher in, According to the pleasure of your grace, The Lord De Baliol to the royal presence. KING EDWARD. I bid Lord Baliol hail, and stretch to him Thus joyfully the hand of salutation. I but salute him as a subject yet; But soon, with God's good grace illustrating To our convinced sense his title's fairness, I hope to give him higher gratulation, And clasping him more closely, bid him walk A brother-king, yoked with me arm in arm, In high-aspiring loftiest fellowship. DE BALIOL. I thank your grace, great England's majesty, For gratulations of such stirring hope; I pray to God your highness may be bless'd With plenitude of days and earthly joys, Even till Felicity's rich well be drain'd; So shall your joys upon us back redound, In their reflection relish'd as our own, As ours again, reverted mutually, Haply may give fresh relish to your grace's. KING EDWARD. Why, that is friendship, Baliol, and infers An interchange of kindly offices Refused by neither, tendered tenderly, And taken not too doggedly, but with A flexible and kneeling gratitude. Why, there be men, who, at a proffer'd boon, Turn up a snorting and a saucy nostril, As if the proffer did accuse their virtue; As if they shudder'd, in their stubbornness, At the immense imagined debt incurr'd By mere receiving of a benefit. Others there be more gentle, who submit To pocket gifts, and scorn not to be grateful. I like the man, whose oily soul is soft To such impressions, who can say “God bless you, I thank you, sir;” and, seeking tow'rd his knee, Can curve a seemly genuflection, Court'sying fair homage to his benefactor. He is the man I cherish, and would fain, For his humility, advance on high, Upon the summit of his heart's desires.— De Baliol, thou art one of many rivals; The choice is in my hands; can'st thou be chosen And not be thankless?—Set by me upon The king-trod platform that commands the world, Can'st thou humiliate thyself a little, And kneel a quittance for thine exaltation? Speak out thy mind, De Baliol. DE BALIOL. Royal sir, When Goodness, like a god, extends a gift, 'Tis churlishness, inhuman, demon-like, To start away, abhorrent of the boon, With grudge and malediction of the giver— What would your grace require? KING EDWARD. List ye, Lord Baliol: William the Lyon, to be Scotland's King, Acknowledged her dependance upon England, And knelt at York, in presence of his lords, Surrender to King Henry. What he did, Thou well may'st do; the precedent is given, Incurring neither challenge nor reproof On him who seconds, not originates The example; which to follow quietly, Good men who cherish peace will much commend. And albeit some few churlish malcontents May rate and rail, it's envy may be flung On the precedent doer who chalk'd out A line of action to his successor, Admitting no transgression; and which he That mounts the throne must needfully walk by: Make up thy mind for answer, Lord De Baliol;— Should'st thou refuse, there stands one at the door Ready to enter in upon thy footsteps, To catch the prize on these or any terms, To cringe the knee as low as I shall bid him, And by a short small feudal ceremony T'avert and alienate from thee and thine, Thy house's hopes, and Scotland's crown—for ever! DE BALIOL. O King!—thou hast assail'd and won my soul:— I yield me to thy instances. KING EDWARD. Then happy, Happy De Baliol! thou art fortune's darling; I do congratulate thee on her embraces; For this thy sons shall bless thee, and this day Shall be the term whence thou and thy posterity Shall date their flood of honours and of joys. Kneel then, my lord, in private here to me Thy sign of homage, which in proper form Before the dignitaries of either realm Thou shalt exhibit more notoriously. Kneel, my good lord! DE BALIOL , (kneeling.) I kneel in testimony, That I do now, as my successors shall, Henceforth and to all time, receive the right Of kingship over Scotland, from the hands Of England's King, our feudatory chief, And paramount superior, to whom 'longs Our realm as proper fee! KING EDWARD. 'Tis done, and seal'd;— Now, John De Baliol! rise thou King of Scotland; Up, and erect thy face to royalty! Look now abroad commandingly; now laugh At thy co-rivals, who, abash'd and baffled, From thy imperial glance shall shrink again Back to their holes of mean obscurity. Whilst thou—To Scoon, and be thou crown'd King John! The sceptre, robes, and holy oil of unction, Await thee there; whilst here I utter forth, By my own mouth, and the collected mouths Of Europe's here amass'd oraculous wisdom, Thy name uncontradicted Scotland's King;— Away, King Baliol, get you gone to glory!— [Exit De Baliol. 'Tis well—that fowl is fledged—E'en let him fly; He is mine own;—I have the gesses twined About my hand, by which at pleasure I Shall twitch him from his heaven of royalty.— Now for the council, whom, embroil'd and vext With wearisome insolvable discussion, My word must disentangle and set free, Melting asunder with one puff of breath Th'inextricable knot that puzzles them. SCENE III. —Council-room, with Lawyers, &amp;c. FIRST LAWYER. The scales of law have been suspended long, But yet the balance trepidates in doubt; I see no outlet from the labyrinth In which we err, confounded more and more, Groping for an escape. SECOND LAWYER. I do opine That Baliol's claim is better by the right Of primogeniture convey'd to John Through Donagill and Marg'ret, two descents— THIRD LAWYER. But that priority seems overborn By Bruce's greater nearness to the stock, He being grandson to the Royal Earl; Whereas his rival is great grandson merely, A point to be perpended much. FOURTH LAWYER. My Lords, The question then, from all its multiply'd And various shoots, converges to this issue: Shall seniority and feudal custom In kingdoms govern the succession, as In other heirships and more small entails? Or shall, in questions where a throne depends, Superior sex, and one degree's more close Proximity, have weight to overpoise That right of birthdom strong in other cases? Speak your opinion, lords and councillors. Semichorus of Lawyers. We are perplex'd! Semichorus of Lawyers. We vibrate unresolved. [Here King Edward enters. KING EDWARD. My lords and counsellors, I greet you well, And wish you happy sweet deliverance From the long fret of this world-teasing theme. For me—I am deliver'd; after close Cautious suspension, weary waiting on, Both day and night, to note and to detect The trepidation of the mental balance, Assisted by that better unseen power That ever hovers o'er the heart of kings, Touching their slightest thoughts with some divinity, I am concluded in this fair resolve;— That John De Baliol, son of Donagill, Grandson of Marg'ret, Huntington's great grandson, As being of the eldest daughter's branch, Bears the true title to the Scottish crown, Over all other claimants. This my sentence, Not without Heav'n, as I do hope, resolved, Will meet, as I believe, earth's gather'd wisdom To 'stablish it:—Therefore, I conjure you, By the regards and deference you owe To gods and kings, and their superior guidance, And by your love of peace, inducing you T'avoid blood-stirring black dissension, That you pronounce, in unison with ours, A verdict friendly to the Baliol name;— And so may God defend and help the right! FIRST LAWYER. At the king's face, as mists before the sun's, My doubts dissolve. FOURTH LAWYER. The sky of thought clears up. THIRD LAWYER. Thank God, the golden thread of Ariadne Is cast:—I do opine, with England's Majesty, That Baliol is the true inheritor. Semichorus of Lawyers. King John! Semichorus of Lawyers. King John! Chorus of Lawyers. Vivat King John for ever! KING EDWARD. God's grace—'tis well; a peaceful fair result; One which, though now shut up and pinn'd within Th'epitome of this poor church, will soon Fly out on fame, and amplify its range From Europe's western to her eastern bound, Winning all tongues of subjects and of kings To gratulate and bid acclaim to it:— Now then announce it to the trumpeters, Those brazen-breath'd artificers of sound, That stand without all ready, with their gear, To volley our decision to the spheres, That the broad firmament may ring of it, And send it hence in echoes to Dunbar; Thence Edinburgh Fort may hollow up The news to Stirling, and that central citadel, In circling waves of sound, reverberate Around that land to which it appertains, That John De Baliol is her chosen king! SCENE IV. —As before. Bruce, Macduff, Abernethy, and other Lords. LORD BRUCE. And so this mock affair is shuffled up At last; and Cousin John, God's grace forgive him! Has sold his country for a bawbling bonnet Of despicable gold! the guilt of which, So bought, will line it with a thousand stings, Making it to his head a cap of torture To prickle him to death:—Go ye, my lords, And celebrate, with cozenage of looks, His coronation; I will stay at home, Aloof from rite so thick with infamy. I'll burrow in the darkest dens of earth, Rather than stand in sunlight, and behold My country beggar'd of her reputation, Enthrall'd, and doom'd, and damn'd to an usurper, By one whose hand should prop her glory up. Can parricide than this be found more hideous? O, I am mad on't; I'll go instant home, And tutor children, family, and vassals, Upon this theme's abhorred wickedness; Adjuring them, by Huntington's proud blood, And prouder, more ennobling, love of country, To nourish, feed, and husband in their souls, Dear hate and rancour at such caitiff deed, Till retribution come. [Exit De Bruce. ABERNETHY. Aha! is it thus? Already up in fume?—Let him go packing Amid his Carrick boors, and fret his soul To death, with crabbed lectures on his rights:— We are enow without him t'introduce King John to royalty. MACDUFF. His speech is bad: I like it not. ABERNETHY. My lord, my lord, be wary; Look to thy words, and single them with care, Lest they bewray thee cross and mal-content. For should the disaffection but peep out, King John has friends to make rebellious lips Regorge their utter'd treason. MACDUFF. Injurious lord! I pray my God, that our dear country be Enrich'd and honour'd from this day's decision. I broach no treason; I inflame no feuds; But my beloved land will pardon me My spirits' heaviness, when I behold Her noble prime, the pillars and the stays Of her too-tott'ring throne, now wheeling off In civil spleen, t'uptug it from the base, And rive it, in their rivalry, asunder: May God defend our land! ABERNETHY. Thy fears, my lord, Argue distrust even of the God thou pray'st to, And of King Edward reigning under him. Edward has banish'd fear, and chased it hence To Annandale, where it will settle down To silence and contempt. MACDUFF. Heaven send it so; My prayers be audible; my woeful fears Rest in my heart unutter'd. ABERNETHY. Hence, away, For Scoon, my lords; the timid droop behind; King Baliol's loyal liegemen forward thither. SCENE V. —A Room in the Palace of Scoon. Porter of the Palace.—Lord Abernethy. ABERNETHY. Why, what's the matter? what intends this stir, Molesting thus, with clutter and with cry, Ere dayspring, the beginning preparations Of coronation-pomp? PORTER. My lord, there stands A madman by, in gesture, gait, and speech, Strange and unusual. ABERNETHY. What? a madman, sirrah? Why, 'tis not strange that madmen should be here; They're here, and everywhere, sown through the world, As thick and gross as funguses:—But what Of him peculiar? PORTER. He stands perch'd before The palace-gate, with eyes as fiery-red As cherubim that burn'd and waved upon The just-forbidden walls of Paradise. ABERNETHY. Aha, 'tis usquebaugh that kindles up His eyes like torches in their drunken sockets; Go get a dozen of your household knaves, And from his fixture drag him by the ears Down to the village-alehouse, where at full He may re-dabble in his fiery cups, And double-light his cresset-luminaries. PORTER. My Lord, it would be easier to unwrench The door-post from the stone to which 'tis mortised, Than sunder him from his usurped spot, Where, like a garrison, he stands and utters Words cutting as the swords of adversaries To those that venture near. ABERNETHY. Tush!—Bring me to him; I'll whip him down, were he as mad's the dog-star. SCENE VI. —Gates of the Palace. Abernethy with Guards, and Seer. ABERNETHY. Who art thou, impudent and desp'rate man, That thus besettest with thy frantic form And most extravagant ill-timed obstruction, These royal gates, that must to-day receive And render back their king in spite of thee And thy contemn'd forbiddance?—Get thee gone In peace! else from thy haughty attitude These hands shall pull thee down, and make thy limbs, Dismember'd and bestrewn all round about, A bloody pavement, o'er the which thy King Shall pass to take possession of his throne!— Speak, if thou hast a tongue. SEER. Yea; I will speak.— O day of monstrous sorrow, dawn thou not— Be strangled in the orient's golden porch Ere thou be born!—Be muffled up, O sun! Ride thou the heaven in a funereal hearse, Thy proper chariot for a day like this! Die out, ye stars—be suffocate on high, Each in thine orb, ere your bright silvery dance Lead on the gloomy and portentous dawn That travails with a birth so black as this! I see it well—the blood-befringed cloud Comes wheeling red and heavy up the sky, From the diseased chambers of the south. My country, spread beneath it, gathers all Its shower of blood and hurricane of fire, That not a vestige of her peace remains. Alas, the murder and the misery! The sights of deadly and delirious woe! War's each fierce freak and barb'rous violation! Making men shudder back into the wish For inexistence, and regret their birth! Forbid it, Heaven!—Seal up these palace-doors— Compact and stiffen every hinge with rust— Make the bars gripe their wall immovably, That force of man may not avail to-day To burst a passage to the kingly seat!— O seat of shame!—O throne of Scotland! once The gem of earth's sublimest glory, now Dimm'd and disglorified by vile disgrace! Perfidious hands have sullied thee; thou art A secondary stool, a foot-rest only For England's haughty feet to trample on— Turn from it, countrymen—O do not give This infamy the blessing of your eyes! Flee to your hills—conceal ye in your valleys— Get into graves and huddle down to death, Ere you behold your country bandied round The world a public by-word, and a hissing!— ABERNETHY , (rushing on him.) Down, down, thou croaking frog of prophecy! Down to thy whips of punishment, which thou Deserv'st so daintily thy lash should be Fretted with hissing hell-fire, to begnaw Thy back with pangs of such delicious smart, Devils should envy thee! SEER. Alas, the murder and the misery! ABERNETHY , (Guards pull him down.) May thy words choke thee, Fulfilling thus thine own cursed augury, Raven of death!—Off, off!—away with him!— [They drag him off. Endungeon him in darkness!—Let him there Sputter his venom 'mongst congenial vipers, Until his King and country find an hour For more severe infliction.—Now, my friends, This dog of an impediment removed, Proceed ye to the work; throw wide the gates; O'ergarnish all their posts and doors with roses; O'erlay with carpets all the entrances; Festoon each gallery with glorious wreaths; Expose and blazon every honour out, That stones and dumbest things may utter joy Congratulant of John, their coming King! SCENE VII. —Hall in the Palace of Scoon. King Edward, Baliol, Lords, &amp;c. as immediately after Baliol's consecration. KING EDWARD. Now that the oil of unction has been rain'd Upon thy head, King John, and thou art seal'd By this most grave inaugurating rite, As one of Europe's Kings, one like ourself, By Heaven's great golden charter privileged To walk on high upon the heads of subjects, And wield thy comprehensive rod of rule From Earth to Heaven, sans limit but the stars, I do enjoin thee, in the name of England, And by the rights, which in thy privity Thou wottest well that sovereign name includes, Stand forth, and quit thy conscience of the debt Thou ow'st, of fealty and due subjection, Contracted even by th'act of consecration, To me as to thy liege lord paramount: Make forth and do the sign. SIR WILLIAM DISHINGTON , (aside.) Ah ha, subjection! What means this foreign and contemptuous word Within these walls, that never yet have echoed To its report? SIR DAVID WEMYSS , (aside.) England hath coin'd it fresh; Our eyes anon shall minister its meaning; Look ye and understand. MACDUFF , (aside.) Humph! A compact! An infamous and damnable collusion, Apparent most in its most shameful sequel. BALIOL , (stepping forward.) Here I do kneel before your royal grace, Ere yet Heaven's oil be dry upon my head, To testify, by deed indisputable, Even to these walls, that they may whisper it Down to a long posterity of kings, My homage as a faithful feudatory To thee, my true liege lord, from whom I hold In fee fair Scotland's crown and seigniories. I kneel and do the sign. [Kneels to King Edward. MACDUFF , (aside.) Infamy! Shame! SIR WILLIAM DOUGLAS , (aside.) Alas! disgraced Scotland! SIR MICHAEL SCOT , (aside.) Sooner might Heaven's sin-avenging fire have scathed our eyes, Than they had witness'd such an ignominy! SIR DAVID WEMYSS , (aside.) Tell not abroad this scandal, lest the hand Of some bold freeman stab us for the utterance. SIR WILLIAM DOUGLAS. Hence, hence, my friends! an evil breath from hell Hath blasted this apartment. ABERNETHY , (to them.) Mutterings here?— Stand more aloof, lest I should hit their meaning. KING EDWARD. King John, I do accept this corporal sign As testimony of your spirit's homage; And in my mem'ry's records, and my country's, As such shall book it and entreasure it. And now, O King, and lords, as all this day's Most capital king-sealing ceremonies Have been completed in the sequence due, That nought but celebration now remains Of pastime and proud pomp of festival Befitting kings, that are consorted thus In solemn brotherhood, to give and take, On an occasion of such grave import, Adjourn we hence for a brief hour or two, That we may recreate and fan our brows With the wind-purged sky; and, from remission, Strain more delight, and exquisiter relish For the large joys that yet unopen'd lie In the rich bosom of the afternoon. MACDUFF , (aside.) Aspics, alas! and venomous worms, twine round The root of this fallacious joy—to eat The false leaves up, and leave a hideous stalk Of rottenness and canker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —Lochmaben Castle. Robert Bruce; Robert, Thomas, and Alexander, his Sons; Martha, Macduff, and Dishington. LORD BRUCE. Good now—our land is king'd.—Marry, how went The farce of kinging and of coronation? My ears are itching for the history— Describe the doings, ye whose eyes were there Licking the lux'ry up. MACDUFF. Our eyes were there, But did abhor, like loathsome leprosy, The representment of that piece of pageant. Our ears were there, but tingled, as with horror, At words of such servility as never Were utter'd yet on Scotland's soil of freedom. Scoon's palace is empoison'd, and become A scab, requiring lightnings from on high To purge off her impurity—Heaven's fire Alone can cleanse her, and his thunder-bolts Avenge the guilt contracted in her walls. MARTHA. Woe, woe, the more for our abused land! LORD BRUCE. Haply, I guess the sequel of thy speech; But tell it out, that we at once may gather The complement of our brow-branding shame. MACDUFF. The day drew near, appointed for that show; And Scotland, from her shires and seignories, Shook out her thousand nobles, who came trooping, Busk'd in their glossiest holiday attire, With trains of livery'd vassals, that behind them, Merrily glistening, trail'd their long array: King Edward, too, th'arch-priest and ringleader Of that blazed celebration, without whom The total rites were dash'd and blank'd with nullity, Stew'd in a sea of sweat, came stalking up With tyrannous and most assumptive strides, Meas'ring the goodly fair land not his own. They came; and Royal Scoon was quite abash'd At such a pomp.—Meantime the day arrived, And now had dawn'd; but dawn was usher'd in With blackness and with darkness, and with signs In heaven and earth, all character'd with prodigy; Day-light was sick, and seem'd reluctantly Squeezed through the murky crevices of sky; The bright-eyed sun was jaundiced; men grew pale, But looking on his weak and washy orb; Ravens, and birds of hideous hellish scream, Flutter'd all night upon the palace roofs, And linger'd in defiance of the morn; The ground beneath the marble chair did quake, And split, and utter groans so dismal hollow, That thrice the nightly-rounding sentinels Ran from their posts amazed; and 'tis said Some wizard, or unearthly minister, With locks of fiery red dipt in the lightning, Stood in the porch, prohibiting ingress, With curses of detestable import. MARTHA. Revered they his commission or his words? MACDUFF. They quash'd the curses burning from his lips; They dragg'd him down; and in despite of heaven, And prodigies as blackly palpable As Egypt's plague of darkness, they usurp'd Possession of the palace. By and by, Began the process of inauguration, Crowning, and baptism with the church's oil, And buttoning on the robe of broidery, And shouldering the golden-knobbed sceptre, And fumbling the superb ring up the finger, And lolling lazily i' the marble chair—. All to a jot were nicely pageanted, That nothing lack'd for gentle John to rise, Steaming and sanctify'd with unctuous vapour, A king complete, and titled to a tittle!— LORD BRUCE. Who handed him from the altar to the throne? Thou, dear Macduff?— MACDUFF. That task had been mine own, As it has been my fathers' since the times Of merry Malcolm, had I not disdain'd That day to do th'hereditary duty; I knew the shame, and hid me from my honours; Howbeit, there lack'd not one, a foreigner, T'assist the King of Scotland to his throne; John de St John, a glittering worm o'th' south, Bespangled thick with golden frippery, Mincing small steps of meant magnificence, Trailed his slimy slow Pactolian track Toward old Gathel's chair; our king, beside him, Was blurr'd, eclipsed with th'excessive glory Of his gay southern garments: And no sooner Our monarch stall'd within his seat, had roll'd Himself in't round about, than Edward, who Sat yearning in his majesty of flesh For that agreed occasion, summons up Th'anointed fire-new king to do him homage: O shame, shame, shame! (I should repeat that word A thousand times, till Scotland's every echo Rebound it back to our aggrieved ears;) King John arose and knelt, and did him homage, Even to the ground he knelt, and did him homage; Even for his crown he knelt, and did him homage: I saw him rise; I saw him kneel; I saw His mean prostration, heard his words more mean, And blush'd at once for him and for my country. LORD BRUCE. Dard'st thou to blush?—Tut, blushing will not do it; Blushing is ignominious; art thou less A chained bondsman to the King of England, By blushing to receive his gilded chains? I will not blush; I will be fierce with fury At such an innovation of disgrace; We could have born it, yea, that cousin John Was over us preferred to the throne, But that he, by such slavish truckling-under, By such a villainous vile compromise, Involving both himself and us and country, Has damn'd himself into pre-eminence, And cringed and crouch'd our liberties away;— It cannot be—O heaven!—it shall not be— Out on it, fye, O fye! R. BRUCE, JUN. Tell us, my lord, How brook'd the peerage this too-bare affront? Sat they contented-foolish on their stools, Or in their writhen faces saw you mirror'd Any dislike? MACDUFF. A few beside the throne, Kinsmen or hirelings of King John, the Cumings, And Abernethies, did make effort at A feeble acclamation, which appear'd Suppress'd to death, even in the attempted utterance. Some hands were clapp'd; but these did squirt so weak, So scatter'd an applause, that the poor few Who clapp'd took shame from those that clapped not. While farther off the throne, and all around The hall, was heard a murmur indistinct, As if of words up-rising in the throat, But back within the bulwarks of the teeth Repell'd by some strong awe; and heads gave signs That spoke; and aged peers, ashamed, shed Vehement tears; and men stole gladly out To give their irrepressible disdain Large vent in words, leaving the geminy Of kings to gossip and confabulate Till feasting-time come on: But, miserable, Desolate of guests, starved of expected mouths, Pass'd the rich banquet, all its thousand covers Unclaim'd, save by a dozen or two that sat Shiv'ring with ghastly vacancies between, At the great tables: And, ere even tide, Without formality of leave-taking, The many had absconded and slunk off, With grudging stomachs, to their different homes, Where now they sit a-grumbling. LORD BRUCE. Better so: Why, at this sin the very land should gape, And utter grumbling thunders of reproof: Come hither, O my sons, 'tis now no time For shallow shifts and paltering policies; Vigour and vengeance now are straining up To th'working-pitch; and Huntington's bold blood Begins to reel within the family-veins;— Hither, my sons— MARTHA. What means my lord and husband? And why this hot appeal? LORD BRUCE. My Lady Carrick, Fear not;—thy children ne'er shall bow the knee Ignobly:—Come, my sons; if e'er my words Have disciplined your tender hearts to virtue, If Scotland's name be bound up in your thoughts With honour, her twin-sister, from the which No separation is imaginable, Kneel down and swear before me, by the God Whose light illumes Earth's thousand mountain-tops, Nourishing men's hearts with sweet life and liberty, That never you shall stoop th'allegiant knee, Or count him king that is not to himself Freeman and king, but hath enthrall'd himself T'another land, that he may rule his own, Abjuring God, who is his only chief: Kneel down, and swear, my children. LADY CARRICK. Swear, my children; It is a righteous and a noble oath! R. BRUCE, JUN. O father, by the God from whom this heart Receives life's ever-gushing kindly stream! I swear, that never I will bow the knee To an usurper, or to him that hath To an usurper cringed in servile homage. Perish the hope of reigning to our house, But Scotland's honour, may it live for ever! EDWARD, THOMAS, ALEXANDER. We swear it, father, in our brother's words. R. BRUCE, JUN. And sooner may a fierce and bloody death Choke in our lungs life's ever-pleasing play, Than in our hearts die out the sentiment Of country's independence and fair name! MACDUFF. I do succeed you with a loud Amen; I and a thousand more, to whom that word Of vassalage is more unsufferable, More killing in its cutting ignominy, Than murder, or men-crushing homicide. Our nobles, all except a household few, Hook'd to King John, are querulous, and up In chafe that undermines their loyalty. Already, too, th'impressive multitude Have caught an inkling that they now are dubb'd The thralls of England; which fast-flying news, Like windy gust that ruffles up at once The many green tops of a summer forest, Excites and irritates the minds of men To murmurs, mad remarks, and speculations. As through the streets of Stirling I did pass, I mark'd the sullen-brow'd and gloomy populace Assembling fast into seditious knots;— I saw the grimy blacksmith's face a-fire With patriot wrath, th'inflamed weaver riving His throat with noble oaths, and feeble tailors Lordly and lion-like with indignation. I heard a buzz flying from group to group, Edward and Thraldom! Ha! such words for Scotland? Destruction rather, thrice-repeated death! Up, Israel, to your tents! and all the way Southward, the market-towns and villages, As if the news had rode on the wind's tail, Ere my fleet steed's approach, had been apprized, And sent their people out to th'market-crosses To flout and rail before the public sun At degradation of their native land. LORD BRUCE. There, there is Scotland's spirit! She will never, Her plough-boys and her cottiers' sons will never, Abide this shame: up, then, my countrymen, Let the rage spread from end to end o'th' isle, Let rankling discontent and sour despite Exacerbate your milk of loyalty To that green gall whereof is gender'd treason, And render you as peevish and as spleeny As are the fitful February blasts Toward the mariner's tormented bark; That Edward's false dominion may be wreck'd And dash'd to pieces on your brave displeasure. For me and for my house—we do abjure him, And fling his misclaim'd lordship back again Into the tainted south, where let it rot For ever in perdition. MACDUFF. That it may The sooner, it behoveth us to keep These discontented humours ever boiling Upon the minds of our nobility, That Edward to his cutting cost may know King Baliol's homage to be not a public, But private act,—disclaim'd, repudiated, And execrated by his countrymen. LORD BRUCE. And that our cousin, on his new-found throne, Fretted and gall'd into uneasiness, May wish that hated fealty unsworn, Whereby he has o'ertopp'd us, and now sits Tottering upon his dizzy summit:—But It needs that we mature these thoughts aright:— Much yet remains to talk and to resolve. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —A Room in the Palace. ABERNETHY, BALIOL. ABERNETHY. He is your bitterest enemy, my liege;— Even on your coronation-day, when yet Th'inaugurating fumes were smoking on you, I mark'd his mal-contentedness of feature, And caught his moody and invidious lips Mumbling black syllables of mutiny. BALIOL. Even let him grumble on; I do not see Wherefore, for one or two distemper'd words, I should distemper my serenity, And simply suffer my dear peace to be Stabb'd to the quick with airy calumnies. ABERNETHY. You are too mild, my liege, and too forgiving; The gospel-precept was not made for kings, Of fair forgiveness of our enemies: Mean men may safely overlook their foes, Or hug them close in Christian charity; But mightier monarchs must let slip their necks From Christian nooses, and in Pagan wise To death must hate and hunt their enemies. BALIOL. To death, my lord?—Recall that baleful word; It grates too horribly upon my spirit; I would not be a king to hear it oft:— Say, what be these great sinnings of Macduff, That he deserves such signal persecution? ABERNETHY. I know too well his deeds and his deserts; Which your too gracious grace interprets so, That you are jeoparded by clemency. He is the colleague and confederate Of th'intermeddling disappointed Bruce; With whom he has in darkling colloquy Been huddling and conspiring head to head, Setting their faction-fostering thoughts a-broach, And in your grace's free unforced election, Searching for friv'lous pegs whereon to hang Exceptious cavils, and disloyalties:— Must disaffection gad abroad with licence, Fattening herself on treasonable breath, Until her monstrous head attain a growth As high as heaven, too lofty to be hit?— I'd rather crush the minim as she crawls, Preventing toil by one good stamp o' the foot, Than hew her down with glorious difficulty In her gigantic overgrowth. BALIOL. O, my lord, Crush her, in God's name, then, within her shell, In silence, that my life be not perplex'd With her vexatious chirpings and with yours. Think not I know th'offence or the offender;— Think not I'm privy to the punishment.— ABERNETHY. Farewell, my gracious sovereign; may thy throne Be 'stablished on the corses of thy foes. [Exit Abernethy. BALIOL. Woe's me—and is it thus to be a king?— A king!—that splendid phantom perch'd on high To terrify and to command the world; Alas! no longer to command himself, But be commanded, and be twisted round Like th'idle vane, by every gust that blows From Passion's blust'ring universal sky. For not alone we to ourselves are slaves, Obedient to the worst of impulses, Each o'er-officious friend, whose hand did help To shove us up the steeps of royalty, The top no sooner gain'd, makes arrogant And violent encroachment on our peace; Which as his services' due meed he claims, Perverting Gratitude's angelic virtue, Ev'n to forbid us to be virtuous:— Then, if to be a king cannot be ought Than to be thus, grant me, O God! again A subject's virtues, and a subject's peace: I'm sick already of sad royalty! SCENE III. —A Woody Dell. Abernethy , with Attendants at a distance. He comes this way reeling from Annandale, All drunk with disaffection and revolt; Here I'll waylay him; hence he cannot 'scape, Caught and entrapp'd as in a sepulchre, Within this bosky cave-resembling dell, So fit for murd'rous ambuscade:—Stand off, My merry men, till you receive the sign For timed approach:—King John, good simple soul, Has whisper'd in mine ear impunity To rid him of this man as of a traitor; This plea has gull'd the King, and may be ply'd T'acquit me of all homicidal blame, Which else might taint me: though in very deed I care not for his tricks of treachery, If there be such:—His being I could bear, Were't not that these his lands, which I do covet, Are gifted with a hollow howling voice That hints his taking off, nor suffers me T'enjoy God's universal boon of sleep, Until he be displaced to hell or heaven, And I enfeoff'd into his things of earth.— He comes—most opportune for injury;— Hey, hearts! Forward, and back me now with ready poniards. [Exit. SCENE IV. —Room in the Palace. King Baliol, Archbishop Fraser, Donagill. BALIOL. Earl Duncan murder'd! and the sheriffdom Of Fife all up in arms? ARCHBISHOP FRASER. True, my loved liege; That murmurer hath perish'd; but his death, Bruited and blabb'd about through all the shire, With aggravation of devised lies, As if the finger of the King were in it, Hath call'd up twenty thousand mutineers, Hot for revenge, and burning for the Bruce. BALIOL. Alas! what have I done to merit this? Scarce rested from the toils of coronation, Outrageous friends beset my throne with suit And over-zeal importunate to cleanse All grudge away from my distracted land: And now their deadly deeds of loving-kindness, Dared, as they say, for my security, Rebound, in their disastrous retribution, Upon my single head. The King, men say, Has hatch'd all this; and, having many hands, In every death or murder of a foe, Even were he distant at the Antipodes, The royal arm glares manifestly out. 'Tis thus the King contracts around his head Clouds of dark blame, engender'd from the fens Just honour'd by the twinkle of his beams; And he must bide the issue. DONAGILL. Let your grace Think rather how too little has been done— Albeit enough to waken ill report, Not so to quash and throttle opposition; For Enmity, too slightly grazed and scratch'd By any dolorous weapon, serpent-like Towards the inflicter twines his saucier head And hisses fouler poison: Wherefore needs Some perseverance in revenge's scheme, Some heart-struck stabs, more forcefully thrust in To end the monster. BALIOL. Would to God he were Dispatch'd or lull'd by any charm asleep, That I might sip of peace. DONAGILL. To taste of peace There wants but vigour—Let the royal features But look severity, and all thy foes, Confounded in their half-hatch'd treachery, Backwards will shrink, ashamed that they have meant, Or mutter'd mutiny. BALIOL. Then be it so, O mother, as thou wilt. ARCHBISHOP FRASER. Let him who lopp'd That lep'rous limb pass out with royal warrant To muster powers, and stifle, ere it swell, The disaffection of the sinning shire; Bribe him to speed and faithful execution; Attach him to the throne indissolubly With cords of super-added obligation, By gift of Duncan's lands, now unpossess'd And vacant for an owner. DONAGILL. He, our kinsman, Merits high meed for services fore-past, As well as heartner-on for those a-coming: That gift be then, with double-doing power, At once the boon for past, and bond for future; So shall your highness sit at ease, enshrined Amid your servants' shelter. BALIOL. Happy should It fortune so; and, in that expectation, Be issued instant powers for Abernethy At once to exercise and occupy As you advise. DONAGILL. We'll have it quickly done; Speed herein is best earnest of success. SCENE V. —One of the Streets of Edinburgh. Enter Two Citizens. FIRST CITIZEN. Whither so fast, my pursy friend? What news Makes you to gallop so asthmatically? SECOND CITIZEN. Heard you it not? The King—the King is off For London.—I've just seen him out o' the Port. FIRST CITIZEN. Marry, 'tis quick; what brize hath stung his ear, That he is gone in such up-huddled haste? SECOND CITIZEN. Men only guess—Conjecture's tongue is pert, Whisp'ring surmises in and out o' the palace. FIRST CITIZEN. I fear King Longshanks, our good lord o' the manor, Will lead our simple John into the mire. SECOND CITIZEN. If kingship be a mire of misery, I fear me out o't; it is Goose 'gainst Reynard. FIRST CITIZEN. Belike, he's gone to make more genuflections; His knees here stiffen with cold northern cramps. SECOND CITIZEN. Kings should have knees only to say their prayers, Like honest burghers.—Any news from Fife? FIRST CITIZEN. Fife is a Pandemonium of misrule; The devil Abernethy is among them. SECOND CITIZEN. Alas, poor murder'd Duncan! mickle dread I His kin will suffer from that caitiff cut-throat. FIRST CITIZEN. His lands are taken, and his kindred all Banish'd or slain.—God help us, times are dreadful! SECOND CITIZEN. Threatening aye worse—Black bodements are abroad; Last night the sky spew'd lapping tongues of fire. FIRST CITIZEN. And yesterday ten thousand porpuses Came wallowing up ev'n to the Pier of Leith. SECOND CITIZEN. And twenty ghosts, in winding-sheets as white As snow, sat cocking on St Monan's steeple. FIRST CITIZEN. A fiery dragon, t'other night at ten, Lash'd with his swingeing tail the frighted moon. SECOND CITIZEN. And Cupar Cross, carv'd with the good Thane's arms, Ooz'd clammy blood that caked upon the stone. FIRST CITIZEN. And on the altar of St Andrew's great Church A human head was found, clotter'd in gore. SECOND CITIZEN. Horrible signs o' the times—I'm sick to speak on't; Pray God we be preserv'd.—Sweet friend, farewell. FIRST CITIZEN. Dear friend, adieu. Heaven keep us both from danger! [Exeunt differently. SCENE VI. —Parliament-House in London. King Edward, Baliol, Murdoch Macduff, and Lords.—Baliol seated in an inferior place. KING EDWARD. Brother of Scotland, we have griev'd to hear, Rung in our ears, bad words, accusing thee As rendering infamous that royalty Whereof thou art partaker by our means; Whence now before the senate of our land We do indulge thee opportunity To purify thy much aspersed head From accusation, which I hope thou wilt Do to thine honour's quittance and mine own, From whom thou holdest.—Is there here a voice T'accuse the King of Scotland. MURDOCH MACDUFF. Sire, a voice Prepared, alas! and fully furnished With oratory, gushing from a heart Injured too sensibly not to be rich And keen of speech. KING EDWARD. Wherein canst thou appeach My brother Scotland?—Is he not thy King And true liege lord? MURDOCH MACDUFF. He is my rightful King And true liege lord; but thou, O sire, art his. Thence in unshuddering confidence I stand Before the throned Majesty of England, Th'accuser of his vassal. KING EDWARD. Let thy voice Be loud and fearless; utter from thy heart Unmincingly thy charge, that we may know The gross of thine unbated griefs. MURDOCH MACDUFF. O King! I come not hither in malevolence Or gall-fed envy, to impugn with lies Him who has claim on my allegiance. Ah no! I come too sadly arm'd with truth, Bearing the voucher of my misery Even on my person, that a child may read; My brother slain, his goodly palace ransack'd, The murderer wallowing in his rich domain, His kinsmen hunted and extirpated, His friends ground down with merciless extortion, Or crush'd into their graves with tyranny,— These are the bloody terrors that have chased Me from my heritage, and hurl'd me hither A beggar, roaming in this sordid garb, Beseeching monarchs for a little mercy, In God-like vindication of the wrong'd. That I am so,—that here I stand before A foreign court, a miserable pleader, Proclaiming thus, in th'energy of grief, My unexampled, huge calamities, Is long of thee, King John, who didst incite Thy minion-murd'rer 'gainst my brother's life, Gavest him the dagger for the ruffian feat, Bargain'dst with him in hell-hatch'd covenant, And when th'abhorred terms were perpetrated, Didst to my cost fulfil thy pledged part, Even to the brim of ruthless cruelty. These are the accusations which I pledge Myself at lance's point to verify Even to the terrible truth-sifting death. God be my witness, and so friend me, God! KING EDWARD. Brother of Scotland, I am pain'd to hear Such sharp-edged words, that cut into the heart Of thy repute: arise, and with the breath Of virtuous contradiction, blow from thee This cloud of black aspersions:—we wait, watching, Thy wish'd reply. BALIOL'S ADVOCATE , (rising.) May it please your royal grace, To hear from me what words th'arraigned king Has arm'd me with for his defence:—It fits not, 'Tis unbecoming England's majesty, And the high honours of the great defendant, That to a subject's libel, one who owes him Faith and knee-duty, he should be compell'd To rise in this assembly, and to ope His royal lips in refutation. KING EDWARD. It may not be: King John himself has heard These honour-staining charges; it becomes him. If his heart leans upon the angel-staff Of Innocence, ev'n from his place to rise, And with unborrow'd anger-bolted words, Repel such monarch-blasting allegations. He is my homager, and I require it. Arise, John Baliol, speak. BALIOL , (rising.) O King of England, My bosom is prepared against this slander, My tongue is not. KING EDWARD. Hence with face-flushing shame! Embronze thy brows, and heave aloft thy heart, Clothe thee all o'er with meet audacity For manly utterance. BALIOL. My procurator Shall be my mouth: My panting heart lies here, Housed in its consciousness of honesty, To echo to his answer. BALIOL'S ADVOCATE , (rising.) Much-honour'd sire, Vouchsafe of thy most gracious condescension, To hear— KING EDWARD. I'll hear no hired proctor-lips; My vassal must defend himself with weapons Coin'd in his mind's own workshop. [Baliol rises and leaves the Assembly. Ah ha! is't thus? What, what, my brother?—Going?— Ha, gone!— By Edward's soul, John Baliol is in guilt; Did you not mark, my lords, his perturbation? How his lips quiver'd, how his colour changed, How his eye trembled in its cowardice, Even on his judges brooking not a glance; Each motion had a meaning, and his exit, Like to a dying sinner's forced confession Cries loud, and ratifies each charged fact. Murdoch Macduff, thou shalt have justice done thee; As thy King's lord superior, I repeal His sentence gone against thee; thou shalt yet Rejoice in thy possessions; and th'usurper Who reels triumphant in thy brother's palace, Shall be extruded, and give place for those Whose is the due and just inheritance. Go then in peace, and be the carrier Of cheer and consolation to thy friends; But in the ears of thy blood-broking foes Shout England, and a speedy retribution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. —Room in the Palace at Edinburgh. Baliol, Abernethy, Sir John Cuming, Lady Donagill. BALIOL. It was even so— LADY DONAGILL. And from a lower place Contemptuously up-cited— ABERNETHY. And my lands Blown by the breath of his despotic mouth Back from my grasp— SIR JOHN CUMING. Now, by St Andrew's cross, Had I been scant of stuff to bicker with him, I'd rather have unsandal'd both my feet, And hurl'd my shoon into his English face! Your grace was too forbearing— LADY DONAGILL. What, to stand Amid his Parliament a mocking-stock, Pillory'd up to view and staged to shame Upon a scaffold so notorious! It would have fever'd my weak womanish blood Up to a frenzy! ABERNETHY. To be forced to hear A sland'rous accusation volley'd from A subject's traitor-throat! SIR JOHN CUMING. I would have raked The inmost chambers of my brain for words As bitter and as canker'd as the devil, To batter at him;—marry, the King of Scotland, Anointed as himself with as good oil, William the Lyon's successor and heir, Th'inheritor of good King Donald's glory, Made thus a spectacle!—Fy, fy, 'tis foul; Detestable and bitter to my soul, As Styx's brimstone wave! All this, my liege, proceeds from homage-doing;— Tut, tut—a murrain catch all supple joints! King Donald was a hero on his rocks; His knees were as unbendable as boughs. Of crabbed oak; they did disdain to stoop, Except to gather limpets; by the mass, He'd sooner lived for aye on barren Barra, And breakfasted on crabs and perriwinkles, Than fawn'd his gallant head into a crown By cringing cravenly the knee. BALIOL. I stay'd not; I took no leave; I hurried home abrupt, From that affront, without the ceremony That clogs and cripples monarchs. SIR JOHN CUMING. Ere your highness Had gone, thou should'st have snatch'd a burning torch, And at her northern suburb lighted up Proud London, with a prayer for Aquilo To crack and burst his puffy cheeks upon't, Till it shone out a bonfire. ABERNETHY. And we must, Forsooth, sit here like whimpering school-boys dreading Their master's lash—till Anthony de Bek Come with his scourge of southern myrmidons To whip degraded Scotland from her peace, And me from my possessions. BALIOL. Be assured He will be here. SIR JOHN CUMING. I smell his sweet arrival; 'Tis in the wind already, and provokes My nostrils to abhorrence. DONAGILL. Come, defy him; Command him pass not o'er our frontier, Else war, the stiffest, sternest hostility To him and to his lord. ABERNETHY. Down with subjection— Away with fealty—let the winds take it— And whiff and fritter it about the world, Till it be worn to nothing, and evanish— At least for Scotland. SIR JOHN CUMING. Revoke is my advice; Unswear, write out a scroll of revocation In letters broad and blazing as the moon, That the whole world may read; and should there lack A saucy-visaged churl to be the bearer, I'll be myself the post, and paste it up On London Tower, maugre her million mouths A-barking to devour me. BALIOL. 'Tis all good:— Were I to travel through the past again, Better that act of homage were forborne. ABERNETHY. 'Twas a forced act, imposed usurpingly By one whose right was only impudence; One who abused his trust of arbiter T'obtrude his proud pretensions, and betray'd Fair confidence, that heavenly stay of kings, To his own selfish 'vantage. SIR JOHN CUMING. 'Twas an act Privately promised, and although perform'd In public, it remains yet unconfirm'd By necessary sanction of the States, Without the which all individual deeds Of majesty are nugatory things Of no account or binding. DONAGILL. It hath been Disclaim'd already by the public voice, That hath been loudly clamouring upon it, In mobs and riots up to th'palace-windows. ABERNETHY. True, true, the public voice hath growl'd upon it; Here it should be respected. BALIOL. Reasons rise, I do confess, many and plausible, For th'abrogation of an homage-plight Extorted with injustice, and therefore Even by its origin invalidated. Thereto, that last, shame-branding disrespect, Across me with its adder-virulence Comes ever stinging. ABERNETHY. Rest assured, whatever Your grace determines, be it to remain Liegeman to England, or t'abjure subjection, Like sequel will accrue:—He will be here In either case alike tyrannically T'avenge and to enslave. DONAGILL. Far nobler, then, Beseeming more our country's dignity, T'anticipate him in the utterance Of indignation, and t'example him With frank defiance. BALIOL. Be it then defiance, Though danger dangle o'er it. ABERNETHY. Let not fear Depress the royal heart;—we have good swords; France will abet us. SIR JOHN CUMING. France will holla to us, And bid us beard the saucy chin of England, Till every hair be agony. DONAGILL. Let letters, Penn'd rich with the abjuration of knee-duty, Sign'd with the glorious roundel of our names, And flaming with the great seal's red impressure, Fly straight to England. SIR JOHN CUMING. Now, I do bethink me, There is a man I know whose mould is cast By very nature for their carrier; A soul hewn from the bowels of the flint, As sullen as December's rainy day, Yet, when it likes him, as jocund as June; As bold as boisterous Ocean in her chafe; As fertile in fantastic stratagem As the Old Serpent on a Christmas morn; As callous-faced and imperturbable As weather-beaten Mary in her niche; One who can worm his wily way unscathed Through a whole nation of mouth-grinning foes. BALIOL. Get him ready; We'll have the writ of abjuration penn'd;— He shall be sent forthwith;—I long to wreak, Thus faced and fortified with your concurrence, On England that contemptuous usage. ABERNETHY. Come, then, Let us about it straight. SCENE II. —Before the Palace in Edinburgh. Dan Henry , Abbot of Arbroath, solus. 'Tis strange;—some difficult and dogged business Is sure on hand, that the King's infinite arm Has by the ear out-cloister'd me so sudden, Exposing to the night-wind's eager nips My face, too tender for such sharp assaults: At two o'clock it fell when I was sitting Glowing all glad with supper and with Gascoigne, Within our Abbacy's refectory; Peter of Pittenweem, and John of Forfar, And Campsie's blissful parson, Lamberton, Three jolly pheers, trigemini of Bacchus, Who had upon a fasting pilgrimage Arrived, were supping with me; and we had Just over-swum the gloomy gulf of midnight, Buoy'd on a dozen bottles: When, behold, Comes tapping with his tip-staff at my door, A royal messenger, commanding me, All hot and joyous-festive as I was, To plunge myself into the chilly sky, And take the road upon King John's affairs. Whereat, conject'ring th'extreme urgency Of the King's need, and greatly loath to be Put to the horn for lack of loyalty, I left my fire-warm, taper-glorious hall, And silver wine-cups sheeny as the moon, And sheenier faces of my compotators, For a most vile exchange—to starve i'th' ether, To freeze in Jupiter's huge fireless hall, To kiss the naked Genius of the Frost, And pledge Bootes for a cup of ice-cream: All this I brook'd; and, at the royal bidding, Came post; methought my feast-hot face did hiss Against the frozen wind till it became Attemper'd to the pole-star; but, heigh—hold— Here comes my man of power, my instigator;— Now, now I must be solemn.— Enter Sir John Cuming. Health, Sir John, And showers of happiness! SIR JOHN CUMING. Hail, good Lord Abbot! Happily come, sweet Saint of Aberbrothwick! I have been watching, for some weary hours, The pleni-lune of your desired aspect, In up-rise peering o'er the heights of Fife;— Happily come to us impatient—welcome, Thrice welcome. DAN HENRY. Good my Knight of Badenoch, When the King bids me trudge, 'tis not in me To keep my stool, and over-count my beads Like an old beldame shivering o'er her sins; As posts the meteor o'er the bridge of heaven, Round from Aquarius to the Virgin's Lap, My mule and I have shot from Aberbrothwick; There's not an owl 'tween this and Sidlaw Hill, That has not been disnested and alarm'd By our nocturnal hurry. SIR JOHN CUMING. Marry, yea, The sweatier and the fouler be the brows, Tested the purer is the loyalty;— And in nice nick it comes; for times are tickle, Tott'ring that of themselves they cannot stand Without the props of sturdy holders-up; Hot zeal and lion-stomach'd stoutness now Are raked up from corners, and impress'd On instantaneous service; for, i'th' faith, 'Tis no chuck-farthing work that's now on hand— Stuff, stuff, for stony-hearted resolutes, Whose backs bear all rebuffs. DAN HENRY. Sir Knight, thou knowest That I am all the King's—back, flank, and front, Even to the nail upon my purest toe: Flesh, skin, and bones, are listed in his service. His enemies may grind them if they dare: What would the king with me? SIR JOHN CUMING. A deed of hardiment, Fragrant with honour, rich with difficulty, Embalm'd with peerless peril and renown; A task King John rejoices to impose, As you, my lord, will burn to execute. ABBOT. Be it to wade through fire, to swim in seas Of molten lead, to caper a couranto Upon the helmet-crest of enemies, At the king's nod, th'adventure shall be mine. Express it simply; were it terrible And grisly-black as are the gates of hell, I will be at it. SIR JOHN CUMING. 'Tis the King's desire, That you do carry to the English throne This abjuration of the English service, And be his deputy to swear away Th'obnoxious bond of service. ABBOT. By my lady, As lustily as I do run to dinner, When th'Abbey-bell sounds merry banquet-knell, Dance I to England on this enterprize. Heigh ho—abjure! That word is to my ears As glorious-dear as Gascoigne to my veins. I swell with pride to hear it—I expand And spread into a giant at the sound; I'll write it in gilt letters on my cap; I'll have it nicely wrought and intertissued Into broad frontlets and phylacteries; The latchet of my shoe shall speak of it; My very night-cap shall be hemm'd with it; I'll holloa it a-top of England's hills Till all her valleys grumble back its echo; The gates of London shall be chalk'd with it; I'll carry round a pulpit on my back, And preach it up in all her thoroughfares; Bridges and wharfs, and parliament, and palace, And Edward's 'sdeignful ears, shall ring with it To his horrible vexation. SIR JOHN CUMING. Thou art the wight, Lord Abbot, thou! ABBOT. Huzza! King John abjures Thy service, Edward Longshanks!—What? A plague on't! Are we in Scotland born to be but sneak-ups To peak and snivel in lean servitude, Hanging our heads like rain-clogg'd bulrushes, To any crowned bully of the earth? Puh, puh!—Fy, fy!—The devil take the homage, And give it for a rattle to his devilkins To play with till they suck it down their throats! Give me th'abjuring letters, good Sir Knight: I'll see to it that they be well deliver'd; They shall not founder for a courier. SIR JOHN CUMING. Take them, my lord, (gives the letters.) To hands more strenuous They cannot be intrusted.—I rejoice To be their giver. LORD ABBOT. Blessings on the parchment! O, I will kiss it!—It is rich, rich, rich! More than the Colchian skin that wore the fleece, For which old Jason tamed the fiery bulls. I'll be a Jason to deliver it; I'll face the brass-horn'd fiery bull of England; I'll sow the serpent's teeth of irritation; I'll raise and rout whole armies with a stone; I'll face St George, abetted by his dragon; I'll be a second celebrated Jason On this great expedition. SIR JOHN CUMING. To provide Against contingent needs of travelling, King John solicits you would arm yourself With this poor scrip of gold. DAN HENRY. Gold? Eh—good, good— A traveller's ornament, and meetest ballast; His special prop and adminiculum: If, as King Philip said, an ass with gold Could win and carry strongest fortresses, What may not wise shrewd men effect with it? Gold is the faith that moves and moulders down Huge mountains.—'Tis a pretty talisman; I pocket it unshamed. SIR JOHN CUMING. Nothing remains But to tuck up; the King's affairs ask haste. I now commit you to the saints, Lord Abbot, And to yourself, the stoutest saint i'th' ubric: Depart and prosper. DAN HENRY. Fare thee well, Sir Knight; Ere yon slow zodiack-creeping moon shall have From blackness re-begot herself, thou'lt see me Again in Scotland lighten'd of the stomach, That now enchafes me. Once more, fare thee well, I go—I disappear. SIR JOHN CUMING. Adieu, brave Abbot. [Exeunt differently. SCENE III. —Council-room in London. King Edward, De Bek, and Lords. KING EDWARD. Yet has the North produced no tidings, lords? Has Scottish John no explanation sent Of his so sudden and disdainful flight?— I do misdoubt him much. DE BEK. Since he flew off Upon suspicion's wing, we have not heard, Even from the babblement of vulgar fame, Wherefore he went, and whither gone, and how He means to carry him in his affairs: He and his court are sealed up and lock'd In dead strange silence. KING EDWARD. We must rip him up By violence, and tear from out his heart His cherish'd secrets, should his prudish mouth, Affecting myst'ry, stint its utterance. Ay, we shall tweak him with our English torture, Until his throat do scream a revelation Of his intents. Enter an Officer. OFFICER. My liege, a messenger, Arrived directly from the North, solicits Admission to your grace: His dusted garb Bespeaks fast travel; and his vehement speech, And little-patient gesture, argue him The vessel of important hasty matter. KING EDWARD. Let him come in. [Exit Officer. We shall be glad to hear Good news from John of Scotland. This falls out In lucky time of day; our querulous Desire-sick hearts shall now be satisfied: Let him come in. Enter Officer, with Abbot. A CLERK OF COUNCIL , (rising.) Thou comest from the North With tidings for his Majesty of England? His Highness sits before thee, and awaits Delivery of thy message. ABBOT. Happiness, And hail to England's high-crown'd Majesty! Pleasure perfume the happy air about him; And twenty thousand golden-feather'd Joys Flutter all round, and with their num'rous wings Flap his bless'd grace into Elysium! This is my royal master's wish, and I Express it in my figure. KING EDWARD. We rejoice In our most courteous brother's gratulations, Which we return, accumulated high With sumless usury of goodly wishes, Oppressing him with benedictions. I hope his grace is well, and sends us hither Communications joyous? ABBOT. Sire of England, King John, my master, is in lusty cheer, And well recover'd of that speechless swoon And syncope of soul that overtook him Late in the middle of your Parliament. That spirit-spasm soon pass'd; his native air, Whereto he ran, purged off the queasiness, And left him re-establish'd in his might Of independent and heroic health, Unpropp'd, unbent, as heretofore, without A staff except his country and his God. As an assurance and stanch proof of this, He sends me to your highness, with commission That I should certify how well he is, Being enfranchized both in flesh and spirit From England's homage and forced fealty. Lo, as I tear this my frail garment's fold, [Tearing his garment. And stamp the rent-off parcel under foot, He tears your bond of service clean asunder, And damns it to the dust of Scotland's soil. Thus, thus he stamps it. To attest that fact With signature and seal, here are his letters, Which I deliver to your royal grace In form, before these noble witnesses; Beseeching, for myself, your Majesty T'excuse a subject's peremptory duty, That pricks him onward to a task so bold.— That task is done. KING EDWARD. O felon, felon!—King?— He is unking'd this instant—Down with him; Dash from his faithless head the diadem; Off with his purple; snap in twain his sceptre; Roll him about in degradation's mire! What! John De Baliol, he whom my breath'd voice Blew up into a throne, apostate now, Abjuring the creative breath that form'd him, And puffing back such tempests of defiance As if he, too, were something! By Edward's soul, he and his perjured land Shall smart for this;—they shall be twinged for this;— With sword in hand, and havoc at my side, And Death, high perch'd on his hell-hideous horse, My lackey dogging me with desolation, I'll trace their blood-streak'd country thro' and thro', Up to the barrier of the Orkney billow, As hungry as an eastern pestilence!— For you, Sir Courier—home, and tell thy master, That if he will not come to me in right, I'll come to him in vengeance. Ah! Mere de Dieu!—I cannot sit it longer; Up, up—no drumbling now on cabinet benches; Action—and retribution—and a sword, To pierce the marrow of oath-breaking Scotland! Away—away. [Council disperses. SCENE IV. —Marches between England and Scotland. King Edward, De Bek, Lords, Herald, &amp;c. KING EDWARD. Look forth, De Bek.—Yet have we gain'd the march That sunders merry England from the soil Where wave the lean, lank oats, their stalky heads Type of the hunger-shrivell'd land they shadow? DE BEK. A little on, my liege; mark there the confines; On this side, tow'rd the sun, the kidney'd wheat Struts his gigantic stature; on the other, Toward the Bear, the husky oaten weed Cowers in his viler furrow. KING EDWARD. Tut, I see it; Our men do shake their heads, and cry, Aha! At that poor porridge-prospect; but our horses Curvet and neigh with gladness, in the hope Of such fat provender.—Cast out thy glance: See'st thou De Baliol yonder? 'Mid his marsh Of long lush oats, can'st thou discern him coming, Love in his face, and homage in his knee, An honest landlord, full of kindly greetings? DE BEK. I see him not, my lord; behind his hills He lurks, asham'd of his degeneracy: He has no face to front his benefactor; He'll be to seek to-day. KING EDWARD. Consumption seek him! I'll seek him not, save on the spot prefix'd For his attendance:—Is the herald here, And ready? DE BEK. He is here, and waits thy word To do his duty. KING EDWARD. Has the Lord De Bruce Been well advertised that it is my pleasure He should be hovering round me as a bird, In hope of picking up the pea of gold About to drop from Baliol's bill? DE BEK. Lord Bruce Now hangs upon our skirts in expectation; The waving of a hand will waft him hither. KING EDWARD. 'Tis well; let now our herald forth advance, And summon our king-vassal to do service. DE BEK , (to the HERALD.) Herald, advance and do the ceremony. HERALD , (advancing.) O King, do'st thou command me now to cite King John, your vassal, hither? KING EDWARD. I command thee. HERALD. Are these the frontiers of the Scottish land? KING EDWARD. They are. HERALD. Then, hear me, Heavens, and hear me, Earth! Hear me, ye Angels, round whose starry chairs Truth and fair Faith are ever ministrant, Hear me, and bear ye witness; I call hither His Majesty of England's homage, The King of Scotland, John De Baliol, Forewarn'd as he has been, of this citation, To do the feudal service, as is due To his liege-lord and master, who now stands Waiting his liegeman on the frontiers. Appear, King John! (Pause.) Again, be witness, Heaven! Be witness, Earth! Be witnesses, ye Seraphim of Heaven! Appear, King John! (Pause.) Once more, be witness, Heaven! Be witness, Earth! Ye Seraphim of Heaven, be witnesses! Appear, King John! (Pause.) He comes not, and the holy bond is broke! Lo, as I pluck this grass up from the ground, And with my breath do scatter it in heaven For every wind to toss it in contempt, My king and master scatters from his heart All faith, once plighted, now contemn'd and lost, All confidence, now swallow'd by mistrust, All union, all protection, now destroy'd, Obliterated from the page of life, As if the traceless past had never been. My lord and master reassumes his right T'accept another homage, and to give Its recompense, its glorious annexation, The power, the crown, to whomsoe'er he will:— I publish it; I tell it to the Heavens And to the Earth;—Earth, Heaven, establish it! Uproot the faithless; make the faithful happy, And make the issues pregnant with reproof, That men may tremble and respect the right!— O'erpass, my lord, and take thy right. KING EDWARD , (overpassing the frontier.) I take it;— Now have my hands got riddance of their bonds; 'Tis mine to give to whom I will. HERALD. 'Tis yours. KING EDWARD. Call De Bruce hither; let us see how now Leans his opinion; we must supple him With oily hopes, butter with blandishments His canker'd stubborn spirit, till he wind Into our purpose or fulfil it, limed With exquisite choice gullery.—I require His name a little while, wherewith to work As a nice tool, to scoop and carve the hole Wherein my honour shall be riveted, Fix'd in eternally like bars of brass. But see, he comes—stand farther off, my friends; Sov'reigns have secrets—ha! methinks he comes More tow'ring on the tip-toe of high hope, Than when my postulatum sent him off Like a mad ostrich, reeling to his desert To hide his eggs in sand.—Now, honest soul, He deems them chipt for hatching, and a crown About to crack the shell. [Bruce comes forward. My lord, De Bruce, All hail, and years of happiness! LORD BRUCE. Thrice hail To England's honour'd Majesty! KING EDWARD. My lord, I bless your genius and your happy star, For timing thus, with dexterous adaptation, Your honour'd presence to this needy crisis, Most lucky at this hour. LORD BRUCE. I come, O sire, Pleased as you were to hint me hitherward; Obedient to thy bidding, yet uncertain Of its import. KING EDWARD. Thou hast done well, De Bruce: Obedience here, at least, is innocent, And may be richly crown'd with consequence. It lies with thee and with thy genius still Thyself t'advantage of th'amazing haps And mutabilities of this great world, Whose many-spoked wheel is ever whirling, Now heaving up the low to kiss the heavens, Now into whirlpools swinging down the proud; As this day's sun can testify, that has Beheld a King shorn of his royalty, Banish'd his throne, and chased back again Into the valleys of subjected life. Look tow'rd the North, De Bruce—if thou dost see A second sun o'er yonder hills, thou see'st John Baliol, King of Scotland! That same hand That hung him up a lamp of royalty, Hath ta'en him down to darkness; and his place, Now void and gloomy, needs to be relum'd With some supplying orb.—Wilt thou demur To shine instead of him? LORD BRUCE. My lord, O King, If in your grace's words there is propounded To me the tender of that dignity, Which now is dropping fast from kinsman John, Thou know'st the terms on which I shall assume it:— For Scotland's crown no homage. KING EDWARD. Out on thee! Does that vain bugbear, that alarm'd thee late, Rise up already to ferment thy blood, And make thee touchy as a porcupine? Why, Homage is become a grisly ghost To trouble thee; it haunts thee; it does gibber Affrightful words even to thy very teeth Against thee.—Chase it from thee, dear De Bruce; I spoke not of it; I ne'er thought of it; It is a pithless shadow which I hate; Its arms are slim and fugitive as smoke; 'Tis good for nothing; I have found it so To-day, and yesterday, and shall to-morrow: But, in its stead, come Generosity! Beneficence! come with thy golden band, T'enlink th'obliger and th'obliged together, As strong, as lasting, as th'eternal chain That binds the solid universe to Heaven! Accept, my lord; we will not bodge and boggle At straws of compact and preliminaries, Or fight for pennyworths of accessary, When pounds of substance are agreed upon: Accept thou, not unthankful; that is all I ask—a simple sense of gratitude, Obnoxious to no base external act, Yet not the less felt cheerly in th'heart Toward the free bestower. LORD BRUCE. If that feeling Implies no mean surrender of my country, No sacrifice of noble self-respect, I will not scorn it; I will cherish it, And keep it in my bosom warm till death. KING EDWARD. Enough; 'tis all I ask; do thou but deign To live as conscious of the benefaction, And wear it next thy heart; not like thy kinsman, Obtrusive at the first with corp'ral signs, Poor supererogatory services, As hollow and unreal as his heart; But, at the last, when the stale benefit Has pall'd upon his glutted appetite, Slighting the gift, and snuffing at the giver With up-toss'd nostril of ingratitude; I rue the day, when John De Baliol Was honour'd by me; he deserved it not By right of birth or eminence of virtue. Thou, thou, my Lord De Bruce, should'st have been King; Thy love of country, and thy rights deserved it;— Yet, yet thou shalt be King.—Let but thy cousin, Stript utterly of power, be fairly roll'd Down to the bottom of Privation's gulf, Thou shalt be up and towering. For this end We both must work, each with his instruments: I with my power will pass into your land, Your name my pass, and my authority, To get and gather up from sea to sea, For you her walled towns and fortresses. Thou must up-muster and excite thy friends, By letter and suggestion, in thy cause, That they may operate with me to scatter Thy rival down to shreds, and fix the crown Upon thy head, with all th'appendages Of power into thine hands. LORD BRUCE. My cousin's throne Was never stablish'd in his people's love; A finger's impulse, then, will push him down So low, his friends will quit him in despair; My friends are many, great, and high of zeal, Requiring but your grace's gracious word, Abetting of my rights, to rise at once, And take possession of the land for me: I will address them to this purport, all, Athol and Marr in chief. KING EDWARD. And instantly, Ere John have time to barricade himself Within his castles to your prejudice. Meanwhile, I with my host will pass along From Berwick, sweeping all the eastern coast, Castles, and towns, and forts, into your net Of occupation:—We shall meet at Edinburgh:— There shall my hostile circuit terminate: Reach you at Stirling and the northern holds, I will secure the south; of this anon You shall have word.—Go then, De Bruce, work out With me thy way to empire, and may Fortune Gladden us both in th'issue. LORD BRUCE. For this task I take my leave of your much-honoured highness, Intrusting my good cause into your hands. Farewell! KING EDWARD. Adieu, De Bruce! Heaven's grace protect thee Until the golden sequel. [Exit Bruce.] Marry, heigh— He's gone—and gull'd, and carries off with him A treasury of hopes, all bladder-blown, As vain, as gilded, and as sure to burst As sun-bright bubbles on the stream at mid-day. How easily the man was duped and caught! His patriotic bluster, and his bounce Of independence, and no fealty, Fell flat to silence, when my well-timed hook, Baited with glittering forgery of empire, Had griped him by the cheek: So readily He that is wont to overcrow the most, And mouth the heavens with patriot braggardism, Glides down unconsciously into the trap Of courage-cowing rank self-interest. So be it now and ever! Thus do kings Manage the world, and with their little fingers Twiddle and turn the wisest men about, Till they wax dizzy, and their mouths renounce The very words that were their boast before!— For Berwick, now;—Approach, De Bek—what, ho!— What is the matter that your face is fallen, Looking disaster? Enter De Bek. My looks, most honoured master, Precede my words to warn you bad is coming. Prepare your royal ear for misadventure: A courier hath from Berwick just arrived, With tidings that three hundred Scottish spears Have overpower'd your royal lieges there, And fenced the city. KING EDWARD. Ha! hath crownless John Shot out his venom in anticipation So sudden, ere he wist his crown was off? Go to, declare it fully. DE BEK. That stout Abbot, That did outface you and your Parliament With his proud preachment of remuneration, Had, like a felon-fox, stol'n back with life Into his land t'advertise it of war: In every village he made proclamation, In every town he hoiz'd his signal up, Edward is coming, countrymen! Whereat The popular opinion, that had warr'd With John, now with a contrary rebound Enclasp'd him with applause: And furious men Sprung from their houses, clad in coats-of-mail, Demanding leave to let out English blood. Chiefly the gentry of war-loving Fife: Impatient they, unheaded and uncaptain'd, O'ersail'd the Forth in ships, and in a band Came down on Berwick. KING EDWARD. They shall never leave it! I'll hew them down to pieces o'er her gutters. St Mary, I shall revel in Dunfermline One day for this! DE BEK. Our navy, congregate From many sea-ports into Berwick Creek, Hath been destroy'd, with insult and with spite. Ten ships were sunk with all their gasping crews; Ten were seen burning as the post came off, Tackling and sails, and masts and mariners, Conflagrant all, and steaming up to heaven In dusky volumes of fire-shrouding smoke. Only a few tow'd out to sea had 'scap'd With their scared shipmen. KING EDWARD. Ah, ye boors of Fife! This little fire, this little wooden fire, Shall balanced be with bonfires of destruction, Anointed with your children's best of blood: Vengeance, arouse thee! O, awake to wrath, Thou goddess Nemesis! DE BEK. They have the town Fortified fully. KING EDWARD. Let them try to keep it; I'll have it ere Good-Friday be o'erpass'd; The Holy Pask must be commemorated This year with corpses and with damned work. Hence, hence! we linger here too long; come, sound The trumpet for my merry men to march For Berwick straight: There's bus'ness for us there. St George and vengeance guide us! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. —Walls of Berwick. Two Gentlemen. FIRST GENT. Good-morrow, sir, your watch is now relieved By yonder sun, who now peeps glimmering out From his half-open'd casement in the east; See'st thou his dazzling forehead? SECOND GENT. I behold him; He's welcome to take up his watch in heaven, And chase us bedward from our nightly posts. I am a weary wight with vigilance. FIRST GENT. Was there aught stirring in the midnight field? Heard you or saw you anything ambiguous, Which cautious men, yet wav'ring in suspicion, Might as a sign interpret that the foe Had not decamp'd and vanish'd to his land? SECOND GENT. There was nor sight nor sound within the wall, Saving the bat that flapp'd, and mole that scraped, Crumbling up idle hillocks to the moon, Where, but three days ago, thick-planted tents, Peopled with surly soldiers, iron-clad, Humm'd terribly with menaces of war. FIRST GENT. I think King Edward be withdrawn and gone; We have not seen an English pennon flying Since Monday's vesper-bell, when all their host Moved westward with the moon's sole privity: And yesterday a hind from Cheviot Hill Reported that he heard their horses' hoofs All on a clattering gallop towards England. SECOND GENT. I pray to Heaven that herdsman's news be true; So we may spend Good-Friday yet in peace, And recreate our souls with heavenly thoughts, Our bodies with good things. FIRST GENT. Look how the sun, His burnish'd feet now leaning on the sea, Scatters his shot of many thousand rays, On the black bosom of the occident, Where Night, as if unwilling yet to go, Coils and drags in her slow-receding tail. Morn makes a goodly prospect. SECOND GENT. She does so To him whose eyes, fresh with the dew of sleep, Search round for jolly sights; but to the wight For-spent with weary watch, I ween, a pallet Of rich soft chaff is sweeter. FIRST GENT. See! what glitters Low yonder in the north, like golden lace, Hemming th'horizon. SECOND GENT. Tut, a dozen or two Of milk-maids, with their pails of polish'd tin Upon their heads, approaching to the town To sell their milky merchandize. FIRST GENT. Look, look, It is no dairy matter; pails of milk Are silvery in their light; but yonder gleam Is yellow, and seems shotten back from brass And points of sparkling steel. SECOND GENT. By Heaven, a host!— I mark their banners in the morning shine: Spears bristle; helmets wave; and heads of heroes, Distinctly now develop. FIRST GENT. Hark the sounds Appertinent to military march! I hear the hautboy's clamour; it rides whistling, Upon the wind. SECOND GENT. See'st thou yon midmost banner, Highest afloat and brightest? Can thy gaze Detect its arms and painted imagery? FIRST GENT. The Lion sure— SECOND GENT. A troop, a troop from Scotland, Fast hasting to our aid. FIRST GENT. I see, I see, The Rothes griffins flapping hitherward Their broider'd wings! Our countrymen of Fife Approach; I know their various bannerols: Triumph and joy await us: Hoa, friends, All hail, and merry welcome! SECOND GENT. Let us hence T'admit them— FIRST GENT. Down anon, and heave the gates Off from their hinges, to let in with joy And flying banners our good hearts of Fife! Heav'n bless our little kingdom! Hoa! coming. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —Within the Gates of Berwick. King Edward, De Bek, and Soldiers. KING EDWARD. Soldiers, 'tis gain'd; now, off with your disguises; Away with your deceitful gabardines; Down with your forged banners to the dust. Be now yourselves and enemies; put off All feignedness of face, and looks of lies, And other foe-outwitting mummery; But muster up into the mounting blood Genuine wrath, honest hostility, As edged and cutting as the steel it wields; Convert your faces into flints; exclude Each drop of milky mercy from your hearts, That gentleness may be this day in heaven, And cruelty hold revel upon earth. Let the sword verify its temper now, And smite, and spare not; let the self-same stab That pins the infant, hugging at the breast, Transfix the mother mortally; fair youth Be saved not by her ringlets; and decrepit Old age provoke the deadlier fell dispatch, From his hoar pate and venerable ripeness For a long-cheated grave; degree, age, sex, Be huddled up in one huge slaughter-heap; Let them all perish, for they all are Scottish; That blasted name attaints them to the death: Now then—branch forth, and parcel out the work; Surrey, take thou the right; De Bek, the left; Be mine the middle streets:—Let us all meet Beside the garrison; Be that the crown And glorious termination: Draw, my friends!— On, on! [Exeunt. First Voice within. Murder—oh mercy! Second Voice within. Ah, alas for him That died to-day, sweet mercy, mercy, lord! EDWARD'S voice within. Hew, hew them down, and spare not! Confused voices. Mercy, mercy! SCENE III. —Palace in Edinburgh. Baliol, Abernethy, Donagill. BALIOL. Alas, my country, my dishonour'd crown! DONAGILL. O, be not quell'd, my lord, so easily; Wind up your spirit to the Lion's pitch, And set and keep it there heroically, Till your insulting foe be counter-wrought And backward spurn'd with shame into his land. 'Tis but a phantom this your degradation; Let England's heralds, with their every trump, Cry from your frontiers up unto the moon, That you are but a fall'n and perish'd King. Has their breath blown the purple from your back? Sits not the crown as moveless on your head? Is not the sceptre firm within your grasp? Your people's love, does it not wrap you round More warm than ever? Fy on these delusions! Go, head your armies as the Lion did; As your forefathers, with unshrinking sword, Aggressors rather than repellers, plunged Into the bowels of the rival land, And hew'd out for themselves a reeking vengeance; So do you— Enter a Messenger hastily. MESSENGER. Fly, my liege! Edward has come And handsell'd us with bloody butchery— Hence, ere his sword o'ertake you. BALIOL. What has chanced So horrible, and wild of character, T'excuse such dreadful words? MESSENGER. Berwick is fall'n, Destroy'd, dispeopled, drown'd in blood! BALIOL. Alas! A fearful fell beginning. MESSENGER. O, my lord, Heap, heap the dust upon thine honour'd head; Exchange thy purple for the grave's sad crapes; Weep for your murder'd subjects! ABERNETHY. Vengeance first, Come Lamentation after; tell it all Ere we cry Woe; and blench not to reveal Its every terriblest particular, That our excited and word-wounded ears May kindle up our ireful hearts the hotter; My hand is on my sword. MESSENGER. The men of Fife, That had arrived to garrison the town, Gallantly stood upon the environ'd walls, Annoying with the tempest of their bows The faces of th'assailants, that full oft To rid them of that arrowy chastisement, They turn'd in trepidation their mail'd backs Towards the barbed shower; and, oftentimes, Excursive from the gates in sudden sally, The Scottish spearmen dash'd the English ranks Into disaster, garnishing the field With all the ghastly-glorious wreck of Mars— Steeds, men, and arms, and banners of St George. At last King Edward, desp'rate of success From manly brunt of war, betook himself To sneaking shifts of Grecian stratagem: A day or two he to the hills retired, Feigning departure; on the fourth, at dawn, He re-appear'd with well-dissembled shields, And counterfeited blazonry of banners, As if a Scottish troop were from the hills A-coming to relieve the straiten'd place: Whereat the men upon the walls deceived, Open joyously their gates; and in a stream Let in their false-faced foes, that Sinon-like Came cringingly, dissembling to destroy. Too soon 'twas found that that admitted troop Bore no fraternal greetings: In a moment, Greetings of blood were given; a thousand swords Burn'd from their sheaths, and in unguarded breasts Housed their life-searching points. ABERNETHY. What, no death Dealt back in recompence? Stood England whole, Unscath'd with mortal detriment? O, tell me, My squires of Fife gave wrathful retribution, And I will hear in patience. MESSENGER. They were ta'en At unawares; unarm'd from house and fort, Forth had they rush'd as for a friendly meeting. Their plated coats had not been buckled on; Their swords were left behind them in their chambers; They were beset with perils ere they list; They fell an easy conquest: Ne'ertheless, Despair to some gave arms and hardiment, That in the threshold even of victory, England did reel and stagger for a space. At last her numbers and advantages O'erbore unaided valour; like a flood She swept the total city with destruction, Encumbering all her vacancies with dead. Houses were ransack'd to their topmost garrets, For pastime to the sword; age-wither'd men And bed-rid women from their pallets dragg'd, Perish'd upon their hearths; th'inviolate cradle To the poor sleeping babe was not a sanctuary; Temples were cramm'd with murder'd worshippers, Who died with blessed Jesu on their lips; Jesu preserve us! cried they piteously. Slay on, slay on! cried homicidal Edward. DONAGILL. O mercy! BALIOL. O my country! O the blood Charged, charged to me most miserable! ABERNETHY. Fy! Leave whimp'ring to our grandames; seas of tears Redeem no lives; arms, arms redeem lost fame; Go, let us study vengeance. MESSENGER. I did leave him Throned on his mountain of slain innocents, Exulting in the vast Aceldama Created by his voice— Enter a Second Messenger. MESSENGER. —Fly, fly, my lord; Edward is at our heels with fire and sword; 'Tis time to hurry upward to the hills, And interpose between you and his wrath, Mountains, and friths, and rivers! BALIOL. More disaster? Was not the first enough, that thus a second Comes backing it with quick succession so? O utter all at once, and press me down With large accumulation of despair! I am prepared for falling. SECOND MESSENGER. May my Lord Excuse my tongue for what it now must utter Of tidings irksome, yet inevitable; Even were I mute, the overloaded air, Charged with the heavy groans of dying men, And cries of panic-stricken fugitives, And shoutings of blood-thirsty foes in chase, Would overtake us with her clam'rous echo, And of herself, without a mouth, report The terrible disasters of the time. Edward is near, my Lord! His steed I mark'd On Musselburgh Bridge; I saw him there Dismount, and in the pure white-sanded stream Wash his blood-bolter'd boots and hands, that dripp'd Horrible drops, whereby the tainted stream Ran from the place all ruddy to the sea. I saw him range his host upon the bank, Giving them merciless instructions; and Ere the dim wings of twilight shade the world, He will be at the gates of Canongate, Demanding entrance, that he may to-morrow Triumphantly ascend the Castle-Hill, And in St Giles's rear his hands to heaven, To thank the God of peace for victory. BALIOL. O heaven, so soon! DONAGILL. Alas, for us and Scotland! ABERNETHY. What, at our gates so quick?—Has the Earl of Ross, To whom that middle tract was given in charge, Been loit'ring round Dunbar?—Sir Patrick Graham, With his good trusty troop of chosen squires,— Has sloth and rust suppress'd their idle swords, That thus the foe comes knocking at our doors So unexpected?—Tell us aught of them, If thou hast learn'd? SECOND MESSENGER. I saw the bloody heads Of Graham, and twenty of his trusty squires, Prick'd upon pikes, and carried scornfully Before the vanguard of the conqueror, Announcing to poor Scotland, in their mute And miserable ghastliness, what doom Hangs o'er her heroes. BALIOL. To the north, O mother!— Dangers rush in and thicken.—To the north, For shelter and for life! ABERNETHY. Abide we here; This crag is stronger than the house of Badenoch; Here have we rocks, and bolts, and barricadoes; Only let hearts suffice and do their duty, Here may we in defiance teaze the foe With our prolong'd existence. DONAGILL. Alas! we have not Or friends, or fit provision to stand out Th'incensed leaguer of our adversaries. The north will find us readier defence; Hence then— Enter Sir John Cuming, hastily. SIR JOHN CUMING. Away, away, my gracious liege! What, stand you here a-piddling about trifles, When life and death hang balancing upon The loss or the advantage of a minute? Look from your eastern window, and behold Yon hither-coming pyramid of dust, Excited towards heaven by English hoofs, Warning you hence, if you have wish to 'scape A cruel death, or vile captivity. Already Horror has possess'd the city; Confusion is abroad; men's faces are I'll-omen'd, and in gloominess forbode An universal black calamity About to fall; cries in the streets are heard, The King! the King! BALIOL. Their King? Can he avail them? Alas! a poor unprofitable name!— Utter not that sad syllable to me!— Perish'd be royalty;—let us but look For safety—'tis high time—Oh whither— SIR JOHN CUMING. Out At the west gate; I have a faithful troop Appointed to receive your highness there;— Moments are now momentous—come,—away— For Death is in the wind. [Exeunt King, Donagill, and Cuming. ABERNETHY. I hear him sawing The thin air with his scythe; we must off too;— A curse light on the jade Necessity, That forces even the valiant to retreat. [Exit. SCENE IV. —A Room in Edinburgh Castle. KING EDWARD, DE BEK. KING EDWARD. The nest is taken, but the eagle flown; Nought have you heard of him, De Bek? DE BEK. He fled Out at the western gate as we did enter; The cunning Cuming, with a thousand horse, Stole him away, and on his scudding wing Now wafts him tow'rds the north; I saw their skirts Just disappearing as the battlements I mounted to explore. KING EDWARD. Another chase! Why, we must ferret out the fugitive, Even from his farthest, darkest hiding-hole; The hyperborean house of John O'Groat Must be ripp'd up; if he should burrow there Beneath the hearth, we'll tear it up and have him: That is resolved. DE BEK. To pay us for his loss, Th'expectant Bruce comes prancing from the south, T'attend with gratulation thine arrival, And fling himself into your grace's arms: He prays admission to your highness. KING EDWARD. Humph! So soon to vex me with remembrances; I know the drift of his besieging suit:— Howbeit, admit him.— [Exit De Bek. —This good man is too Exact and scrupulous in all his points; Would that his memory were less compact, More of the nature of sea-govern'd sand, That the quick waves of days might wear away Half of its troublesome too-deep impressions:— He must be clamour'd down, out-faced, out-voiced With opposition and flat gain-saying;— For why?—King's promises are high as heaven Above exaction of precise fulfilment; Nor be it his to dun and persecute High Majesty for words of courteous course: He comes;—I must conform my face to meet him. Enter De Bek with Bruce; De Bek exit. Hail, hail, my lord, and welcome! LORD BRUCE. Happiness Circle your grace's person, and success, With glory, sit upon your crown for ever, Sov'reign of England! KING EDWARD. Lord De Bruce, I thank thee For these thy wishes and too plain deserts, In thus contributing with all thy force To bring about this joyous winding-up. Thou see'st we lord it in this royal crag; The town, the castle, all the land is mine Southward to Tweed. LORD BRUCE. I with my armament From Annandale up-ranging, have reduced The midland shires, compelling them to acknowledge Th'authority of our combined names. And Stirling Fort, ere this same hour to-morrow, Possess'd by Marr and Athol, shall have shut Her gates on flying Baliol, and up-rear'd Predominant in kingly elevation, The banner of our house, wedded full close With England's staff of mightier majesty. KING EDWARD. The banner of thine house!—And wedded close With England's majesty! England abjures All intermarriage with a stranger's flag: She conquers for herself, and will not brook An interloper to come dabblingin To challenge what her toilsome sword has gain'd: Look up, my lord—the flag of England waves Alone from this your fort;—if thou shalt see it Twined in expanded amity with yours, Then, then, thou may'st imagine to thyself A right t'intrude upon me with requests, And challenge kingdoms which thou conquer'dst not. LORD BRUCE. Not such, O King of England; were the terms And golden lure of large encouragement, What day thou stood'st upon our frontiers Craving my name to shadow and excuse Thy now-avow'd aggression on our land;— Recall thy words.— KING EDWARD. I will recall no words; Words perish with the breath that wraps them up. My sword is trusty and imperishable; My sword had ever but this one intent; My sword hath conquer'd Scotland—not for thee, But for herself:—What! had I nought to do But go a kingdom-hunting for another, Squandering the treasure of my subjects' blood, And the dear sweat of mine own precious brows, To fix th'invidious circlet upon thine? Away, my lord, with these remembrances; Time and occurrences have made them stale; I hate them, and do hang them up for ever Upon Oblivion's gibbet, that they may Henceforth upbraid me not. LORD BRUCE. If so—my lord, Farewell;—I leave thee with thine own glad heart T'enjoy the bitter prize of perfidy;— I go to weep for Scotland! [Exit De Bruce. KING EDWARD. Go thy ways; Weep down thy big-swoln haughtiness with tears, And let thy mortified o'er-reached soul Fasten avengingly upon herself Self-accusation's ever-gnawing teeth, Till she with fretting eat herself away, And perish in a pet:—With thee I've done; Thou shalt not plague me more. Thy kinsman now, That ghost of royalty, remains to be Laid in Annihilation's silent grave, That he may not out-stare me in my joys. About it, then, my heart; St Edward, aid me, And grant our wish its glorious corollary. SCENE V. —Castle of Montrose. King Edward, Sir John Cuming. KING EDWARD. Cuming, thou comest from thy kinsman; what Means he to do? Interpret his intention; If still he scorns to yield his body up, And, maugre fortune, will persist to be Hunted up to the margins of the world, Why, we will bay him round about with mouths Of howling and determined enemies, Until he shall be straiten'd and hemm'd in Unto a coffin's length:—If, diffident Of his affairs, and confident in us, He throw himself beseeching at our feet, We will not stint our tender mercies then; We will let peer our goodness, and despoil him, Not of his life, but of his taberd merely, And ship him, shorn and disencumber'd thus Of all oppressive ornament, for London, Where some beneficent and kindly roof Shall fend the bleak winds of adversity From farther beating on his batter'd locks. Speak, Cuming, what he wills. SIR JOHN CUMING. Most honour'd sire, My kinsman John, a-weary now of pomp, Sick with the tossings of disastrous days, Seeks only rest, most willing to forego Into your hands that crown that has to him Been but a thorny coronet of cares: His prayer has stirr'd me hither to your grace, That I might proffer for him, and receive Your royal pleasure. KING EDWARD. I am glad of this; Cuming, thou dealest well; I do commend Thy forward zeal, for thy poor kinsman's sake; 'Tis for his own and for his country's weal, That he endure demission:—Bid him come To-morrow, decorated cap-a-pee, With diadem, and ring, and robe, and sceptre; And strip himself with voluntary hand, Of all these vain misplaced appendages, Freely to put them in the hands of him To whom they appertain. SIR JOHN CUMING. He shall be here, At the due hour, in all th'accoutrements Of royalty, about to be thrown off By him, for ever. KING EDWARD. We shall have a ship, Equipt with mariners and goodly tackle, Riding within the basin, ready to slip Her haulsers, and put straightway out to sea; Her cabin shall be wainscotted and warm, Appointed well with viands and with wines. We will inship him on the instant after His resignation; he'll be quite at home Under the hatches; and, as now the weather Seems smooth and untormented with loud winds, He'll find a nimble voyage, and arrive Soon at his gladsome port. SIR JOHN CUMING. 'Tis well arranged; To-morrow we will wait upon your grace, And celebrate demission in due form. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. —Montrose. Baliol, Sir John Cuming. SIR JOHN CUMING. My liege, I have a leter from the North, Enveloping black news that touch us both;— Your lady-mother, Donagill, is dead.— BALIOL. Misery on misery heap'd! Me miserable! My mother dead! Alas!— Grief for her wretched son hath laid her low; O, would to God I had preceded her, And she had clad me in my coffin-clothes, Ere I had seen such cruel, cruel times! Bereft of peace, of mother, and of friends, I do not live—I die upon the earth, Dragging such heavy days of dismal dole, As make me gratulate the churchyard dead, On being couched in their beds of rest: O, Cuming! I am sick of persecution! Find out a grave for me; I'll lay me down And court the shelter of its wormy mould From an enraged, false, unworthy world; Yet tear from me these rags of royalty Ere I be bury'd; they would spoil my rest, And make me shudder deep within my grave, Remembering me of what calamities They brought so thick upon me:—Take them off;— Hence every rag; Cuming, I fain would go To heaven without them. SIR JOHN CUMING. Good my liege, the hour Is come that shall relieve you of th'oppression Of these heart-breaking symbols:—England's King Waits to receive them. BALIOL. Let us go to him: O, how I long to be despoil'd! Come, come! I faint till I be lighten'd. [Exeunt. SCENE VII. —Montrose Castle. King Edward, De Bek, and Lords. KING EDWARD. Is the ship ready? DE BEK. All prepared, my liege, Even to the biscuit in her cabin-lockers; She strings upon her cables restlessly Impatient for her freight— KING EDWARD. And the wind sits In a propitious quarter. DE BEK. Very fair; Thin gentle puffs come winnowing from the hills, Making the mainsail hollow. KING EDWARD. I am glad on't. I would not wish John Baliol to be toss'd Into heart-racking nausea by storms: He's had enough on land: Bid Cuming now Conduct him in—'tis time.—Ere an hour pass, Winds may prove false.—Stand back, my lords, expand Free space for this depriving ceremony. Ranged amply round, your eyes can feed the fuller On the despoiling. Enter Cuming with Baliol, who comes arrayed in all the badges of royalty. He takes his place opposite Edward. SIR JOHN CUMING. O! much-honour'd King, Behold before thine eyes King John of Scotland, Prepared to give his glories up to thee, From whom they emanated. KING EDWARD. Comes King John All free and uncompell'd to render back His honours and their symbols? SIR JOHN CUMING. He comes free, Without hypocrisy of heart, sincere Almost to joy, that he is to resign A weight of honour too intolerable. KING EDWARD. Chimes John De Baliol in this fair reply? BALIOL. Oh, my good Lord! see, see these gushing tears That through the liquid sockets of mine eyes Come raining from my anguish-pressed heart, To tell thee in their simple eloquence, What sorrow has been mine since I put on This joy-undoing garniture of kings. O take it in thy mercy back again; Restore me to my happy humble self, My little, little self:—Take, take, oh take— [Steps forward and divests himself. 'Tis all thine own; and disencumber me For ever of a grandeur not belonging; For ever I renounce it for myself; For ever I renounce it for my boy; O no, he shall not touch it; 'twould be cruel To curse him with such high inheritance. So—so—with this (giving the sceptre) I give, and roll away Into thy capabler and mightier hand, That insupportable great golden weight, That nearly crush'd me in the sepulchre. 'Twas mine—'tis thine—now, now, restore, my lord, What price too dear I sacrificed for it, The blessings of sequester'd privacy; Th'unclouded day; the nought-suspecting night, Unvex'd with dread of bloody stratagem; The dwelling on the hill; the forest walk; The abandonment to meditation, And all a subject's paradise of peace. These are the solid gifts, my Lord, I crave For what of glory's gauds I render up; 'Tis but a cheap, a little boon—O bless me, Bless me immensely with it. KING EDWARD. So I will. I do not turn a deaf ear to the cries Of woeful men, beseeching my protection. My lap of mercy is replete with gifts For weeping, needy supplicants, like thee. I have a house in London, whose apartments Keep Comfort prison'd; whose great doors are barr'd Against aggression of night-noying Care; Sleep settles in it; and this world's disturbance Batters in vain upon its flinty walls, That not a sound can penetrate their thickness. Baliol, I recommend it for thy mansion; Till thy sky clear, and every cloud is off, There thou shalt house securely. For this end, To lose no time to waft thee into happiness, A vessel, by me freighted, in the basin, Hangs on her cables; at the helmsman's shout, Ready to bolt abroad into the deep, Whene'er her happy hatches catch thy foot. The wind blows fair, my Lord; descend, and take Thy little, mincing, pretty boy with thee; His playful speech and interrogatories, Sweet childish pranks, and dandlings on the knee, Will much amuse thee in thy rolling cabin. And when thou touchest mine own Thames's wharf, My well-instructed servants shall be seen There waiting, to escort thee gaily home To thy sojourn. Go then, my Lord, in peace, Nor think thou more of Scotland. BALIOL. Then farewell, My native land!—O be thou happier Under another's guidance than mine own!— Come, Cuming, come away. Adieu, adieu, My gracious Lord of England! [Exit with Cuming. KING EDWARD. See him down, De Bek; convoy him safely to the beach, And hand him snug aboard. [Exit De Bek. He's off!—he's gone!— And Scotland is all mine!—The grudging Bruce, I hear, pines down so fast, that scarce his pillow Hears the death-gargle in his grumbling throat; He will be dead to-morrow. Spread out then, lords, divide and seize the land; Warren, waste thou the west; good Cressingham, Inhabit thou the north; Plantagenet, Plunder the east. See to't, my gallant lords, That they be spoil'd. Let your investing wings, Like sponges, lick up every crumb of substance, Gold every driblet, that the pilfer'd peasant Have not a penny for the church on Sundays; Let captain and let soldier revel it, And ramp at large, untether'd by restraint, In th'unforbidden pastures of this land; Be conqueror's every mad, fierce, hair-brain'd frolic, Play'd roundly off upon these homage-breakers, That they at last may meditate repentance, And know the value of a cringe o'th' knee.— Away, then, lords!—seize, plunder, occupy!
