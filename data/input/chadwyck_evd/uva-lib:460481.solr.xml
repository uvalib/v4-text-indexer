      <field name="fulltext">THE HONEY MOON: A COMEDY, IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. (Written by a Friend.) No uniformity in life is found:â In ev'ry scene varieties abound; And inconsistency still marks the plan Of that immortal noble being, Man. As changeful as the April's morning skies, His feelings and his sentiments arise; And nature to his wond'rous frame has given The mingled elements of earth and heaven. In diff'rent climes and ages, still we find The same events for diff'rent ends design'd: And the same passion diff'rent minds can move To thoughts of sadness or to acts of love. Hence Genius draws his novel copious store; And hence the new creations we adore: And hence the scenic art's undying skill Submits our feeling to its potent will; From common accidents and common themes Awakens rapture and poetic dreams; And, in the trodden path of life, pursues Some object cloth'd in Fancy's loveliest huesâ To strengthen nature, or to chasten art, To mend the manners, or exalt the heart. So thought the man whom you must judge to-night; And as he thought, he boldly dar'd to write. Not new the subject of his first-born rhyme; But one adorn'd by bards of elder time;â Bards with the grandest sentiments inspir'dâ Bards that in rapture he has still admir'd; And tried to imitate, with ardour warm, And catch the spirit of their pow'rful charm. With loftiest zeal and anxious hope he sought To bring to modern times their strength of thought; And, in their glowing colours, to display The follies and the virtues of the day. Whether his talents have his wish belied, Your judgment and your candour must decide. He, though your loftiest plaudits you should raiseâ He cannot thank you for the meed of praise: Rapture he cannot feel, nor fear, nor shame; Connected with his love of earthly fame, He is no more.âYet may his memory live In all the bloom that early worth can give: Should you applaud, 'twould check the flowing tear Of those to whom his name and hopes are dear. But should you an unfinish'd structure find, As in its first and rudest forms design'd, As yet not perfect from the glowing mind, Then with a gentle voice your censure spread, And spare the livingâspare the sacred Dead!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âA Street in Madrid. Enter Duke and Montalban, followed by a Servant. The Duke (speaking to Jaquez). This letter you will give my steward;âthis To my old tenant, Lopez. Use dispatch, sir; Your negligence may ruin an affair Which I have much at heart.â[Exit Servant.]âWhy how now, Count! You look but dull upon my wedding-day, Nor shew the least reflexion of that joy Which breaks from me, and should light up my friend. Count. If I could set my features to my tongue, I'd give your highness joy. Still, as a friend Whose expectation lags behind his hopes, I wish you happy. Duke. You shall see me so.â Is not the lady I have chosen fair? Count. Nay, she is beautiful. Duke. Of a right age? Count. In the fresh prime of youth, and bloom of womanhood. Duke. A well-proportion'd form and noble presence? Count. True. Duke. Then her wit? Her wit is admirable! Count. There is a passing shrillness in her voice. Duke. Has she not wit? Count. A sharp edg'd tongue, I own; But uses it as bravoes do their swordsâ Not for defence, but mischief. Then, her gentleness! You had almost forgot to speak of that. Duke. Ay, there you touch me! Yet, tho' she be prouder Than the vext ocean at its topmost swell, And ev'ry breeze will chase her to a storm, I love her still the better. Some prefer Smoothly o'er an unwrinkled sea to glide; Others to ride the cloud-aspiring waves, And hear, amid the rending tackle's roar, The spirit of an equinoctial gale. What tho' a patient and enduring loverâ Like a tame spaniel, that with crouching eye Meets buffets, and caressesâI have ta'en With humble thanks her kindness and her scorn; Yet when I am her husband, she shall feel I was not born to be a woman's slave! Can you be secret? Count. You have found me so In matters of some moment. Duke. Listen, then: I have prepar'd a penance for her pride, To which a cell and sackcloth, and the toils Of a barefooted pilgrimage, were pastime. As yet she knows me, as I truly am, The Duke Aranza: in which character I have fed high her proud and soaring fancy With the description of my state and fortunes, My princely mansions, my delicious gardens, My carriages, my servants, and my pomp. Now mark the contrast.âIn the very height And fullest pride of her ambitious hopes, I take her to a miserable hut (All things are well digested for the purpose); Where, throwing off the title of a duke, I will appear to her a low-born peasant. There with coarse raiment, household drudgery, Laborious exercise, and cooling viands, I will so lower her distemper'd blood And tame the devil in her, that, before We have burnt out our happy honey moon, She, like a well-train'd hawk, shall at my whistle Quit her high flights, and perch upon my finger To wait my bidding. Count. Most excellent! A plot of rare invention! Duke. When with a bold hand I have weeded out The rank growth of her pride, she'll be a garden Lovely in blossom, rich in fruit; till then, An unprun'd wilderness.âBut to your business. How thrives, your suit with her fair sister, Count? Count. The best advancement I can boast of in it Is, that it goes not backward. She's a riddle, Which he that solv'd the sphinx's, would die guessing. If I but mention love, she starts away, And wards the subject off with so much skill, That whether she be hurt or tickled most Her looks leave doubtful. Yet I fondly think She keeps me (as the plover from her nest Fearful misleads the trav'ller) from the point Where live her warmest wishes, that are breath'd For me in secret. Duke. You've her father's voice? Count. Yes: and we have concerted, that this evening, Instead of Friar Dominic her confessor, Who from his pious office is disabled By sudden sickness, I should visit her; And, as her mind's physician, feel the pulse Of her affection. Duke. May you quickly find Her love to you the worst of her offences! For then her absolution would be certain. Farewel! I see Rolando. He is a common railer against women; And on my wedding-day I will hear none Blaspheme the sex. Besides, as once he fail'd In the same suit that I have thriven in, 'Twill look like triumph. 'Tis a grievous pity He follows them with such a settled spleen, For he has noble qualities. Count. Most rare onesâ A happy wit, and independent spirit. Duke. And then he's brave, too. Count. Of as tried a courage As ever walk'd up to the roaring throats Of a deep-rang'd artillery; and planted, Midst fire and smoke, upon an enemy's wall The standard of his country. Duke. Farewel, Count. Count. Success attend your schemes! Duke. Fortune crown yours! [Exit Duke. Count and Rolando. Count. Signor Rolando, you seem melancholy. Rolando. As an old cat in the mumps. I met three womenâ I marvel much they suffer them to walk Loose in the streets, whilst other untam'd monsters Are kept in cagesâthree loud talking women; They were discoursing of the newest fashions, And their tongues went likeâI have since been thinking What most that active member of a woman Of mortal things resembles.â Count. Have you found it? Rolando. Umph! not exactlyâsomething like a smoke-jack; For it goes ever without winding up: But that wears out in timeâthere fails the simile. Next I bethought me of a water-mill, But that stands still on Sundays: woman's tongue Needs no reviving sabbath. And, besides, A mill, to give it motion, waits for grist; Now, whether she has aught to say or no, A woman's tongue will go for exercise. In short, I came to this conclusion: Most earthly things have their similitudes, But woman's tongue is yet incomparable.â Was't not the Duke that left you? Count. 'Twas. Rolando. He saw me. And hurried off!âA cur, that has been caught Privately stealing in a butcher's shop, Ne'er sneak'd away more scurvily. He knew I should have rated him. Count. Aye! 'twas most wise in him To shun the bitter flowing of your gall.â You know he's on the brink of matrimony. Rolando. Why now, in reason, what can he expect? To marry such a woman! A thing so closely pack'd with her own pride, She has no room for any thought of him. Why, she ne'er threw a word of kindness at him But when she quarrell'd with her monkey. Then, As he with nightly minstrelsy dol'd out A lying ballad to her peerless beauty, Unto his whining lute, and at each turn Sigh'd like a paviour, the kind lady, sir, Would lift the casement up to laugh at him, And vanish like a shooting star; whilst he, Like an astronomer in an eclipse, Stood gazing on the spot whence she departed: Then, stealing home, went supperless to bed, And fed all night upon her apparition. Now, rather than espouse a thing like this, I'd wed a bear that never learnt to dance, Though her first hug were mortal. Count. Peace, Rolando! You rail at women as priests cry down pleasure; Who, for the penance which they do their tongues, Give ample licence to their appetites. Come, come; however you may mask your nature, I know the secret pulses of your heart Beat towards them still. A woman-hater! Pshaw! A young and handsome fellow, and a brave oneâ Rolando. Go on. Count. Had I a sister, mother, nay, my grandam, I'd no more trust her in a corner with thee, Than cream within the whiskers of a cat. Rolando. Right! I should beat her. You are very right, I have a sneaking kindness for the sex; And could I meet a reasonable woman, Fair without vanity, rich without pride, Discreet though witty, learn'd, yet very humble; That has no ear for flattery, no tongue For scandal; one who never reads romances; Who loves to listen better than to talk, And rather than be gadding would sit quiet; Hates cards and cordials, goes ill-dress'd to church; I'd marry certainly. You shall find two such, And we'll both wed together. Count. You are merry.â Where shall we dine together? Rolando. Not to-day. Count. Nay, I insist. Rolando. Where shall I meet you, then? Count. Here, at the Mermaid. Rolando. I don't like the sign; A mermaid is half-woman. Count. Pshaw, Rolando! You strain this humour beyond sense or measure. Rolando. Well, on condition that we're very private, And that we drink no toast that's feminine, I'll waste some time with you. Count. Agreed. Rolando. Go on, then; I will but give directions to my page, And follow you. Enter Eugenio. Count. A pretty smooth-fac'd boy. Rolando. The lad is handsome; and for one so young, Save that his heart will flutter at a drum, And he would rather eat his sword than draw it, He is the noblest youth in Christendom, The kindest and most gentle. Talk of woman! Not all the rarest virtues of the sex, If any cunning chemist could compound them, Would make a tythe of his. When before Tunis I got well scratch'd for leaping on the walls Too nimbly, that same boy attended me. 'Twould bring an honest tear into thine eye To tell thee how for ten days, without sleep And almost nourishment, he waited on me; Cheer'd the dull time by reading merry tales; And when my fest'ring body smarted most, Sweeter than a fond mother's lullaby Over her peevish child, he sung to me, That the soft cadence of his dying tones Dropt like an oily balsam on my wounds, And breath'd an healing influence throughout me.â But this is womanish!âOrder our dinner, And I'll be with you presently. Count. I will not fail. [Exit Count. (Zamora comes forward.) Rolando. The wars are ended, boy. Zamora. I'm glad of that, sir. Rolando. You should be sorry, if you love your master.â Zamora. Then I am very sorry. Rolando. We must part, boy!â Zamora. Part? Rolando. I am serious. Zamora. Nay, you cannot mean it. Have I been idle, sir, or negligent? Saucy I'm sure I have not.âIf aught else, It is my first fault; chide me gently for itâ Nay, heavily;âbut do not say,âwe part! Rolando. I'm a disbanded soldier, without pay, Fit only now with rusty swords and helmets To hang up in an armoury, till the wars New burnish me again; so poor, indeed, I can but leanly cater for myself, Much less provide for thee. Zamora. Let not that Divide us, sir; the thought of how I far'd Never yet troubled me, and shall not now. Indeed, I never follow'd you for hire, But for the simple and the pure delight Of serving such a master.âIf we must part, Let me wear out my service by degrees; To-day omit some sweet and sacred duty, Some dearer one to morrow: slowly thus My nature may be wean'd from her delight: But suddenly to quit you, sir!âI cannot!â I should go broken hearted. Rolando. Pshaw, those tears! Well, well, we'll talk of this some other day. I dine with Count Montalban at the Mermaid; In the mean time, go, and amuse yourself With what is worthiest note in this fam'd city.â But hark, Eugenio! 'Tis a wicked place; You'll meet (for they are weeds of ev'ry soil) Abundance here ofâwomen;âkeep aloof!â For they are like the smooth, but brittle, ice, That tempts th' unpractis'd urchin to his ruin. They are like comets, to be wonder'd at, But not approach'd: eccentric in their course, They sweep in dazzling state before men's eyes, But carry sure destruction in their train.â Go not within their reach! Zamora. Doubt me not, sir.â What a hard fate is mine!âto follow thus With love a gentleman that scorns my sex, And swears no great or noble quality Ever yet liv'd in woman!âWhen I read to him The story of Lucretia, or of Portia, Or other glorious dames, or some rare virgin Who, cross'd in love, has died,â'mid peals of laughter, He praises the invention of the writer; Or, growing angry, bids me shut the book, Nor with such dull lies wear his patience out. What opposition has a maid like me To turn the head-strong current of his spleen! For tho' he sets off with a lavish tongue My humble merits, thinking me a boy, Yet, should I stand before his jaundic'd sight A woman, all that now is fair in me Might turn to ugliness; all that is good Appear the smooth gloss of hypocrisy:â Yet, I must venture the discovery, Tho' 'tis a fearful hazard. This perplexity Of hopes and fears makes up too sad a life; I will or lose him quite or be his wife. [Exit. SCENE II. âA Room in Balthazar's House. Enter Balthazar and Volante. Balthazar. Not yet apparell'd? Volante. 'Tis her wedding-day, sir: On such occasions women claim some grace. Balthazar. How bears she The coming of her greatness? Volante. Bravely, sir. Instead of the high honours that await her, I think that, were she now to be enthron'd, She would become her coronation: For, when she has adjusted some stray lock, Or fixt at last some sparkling ornament, She views her beauty with collected pride, Musters her whole soul in her eyes, and says, âLook I not like an Empress?â But, she comes.â Enter Juliana, in her Wedding-dress. Juliana. Well, sir, what think you? do I to the life Appear a duchess, or will people say, She does but poorly play a part which nature Never designed her for?âBut, where's the Duke? Balthazar. Not come yet. Juliana. How! not come?âthe Duke not come! Volante. Patience, sweet sister; oft without a murmur It has been his delight to wait for you. Juliana. It was his duty.âMan was born to wait On woman, and attend her sov'reign pleasure! This tardiness upon his wedding-day Is but a sorry sample of obedience. Balthazar. Obedience, girl! Juliana. Ay, obedience! sir. Volante. Why, what a wire-drawn puppet you will make The man you marry!âI suppose, ere long, You'll choose how often he shall walk abroad For recreation; fix his diet for him; Bespeak his clothes, and say on what occasions He may put on his finest suit;â Juliana. Proceed. Volante. Keep all the keys, and when he bids his friends, Mete out a modicum of wine to each. Had you not better put him on a livery At once, and let him stand behind your chair?â Why, I would rather wed a man of dough, Such as some school-girl, when the pye is made, To amuse her childish fancy, kneads at hazard Out of the remnant pasteâa paper man Cut by a baby. Heav'ns preserve me ever From that dull blessingâan obedient husband! Juliana. And make you an obedient wife!âa thing For lordly man to vent his humours on; A dull domestic drudge, to be abus'd Or fondled as the fit may work upon him;â âIf you think so, my dear,â and, âAs you please;â And, âYou know best;ââeven when he nothing knows. I have no patienceâthat a free-born woman Should sink the high tone of her noble nature Down to a slavish whisper, for that compound Of frail mortality they call a man, And give her charter up, to make a tyrant!â Balthazar. You talk it most heroically.âPride May be a proper bait to catch a lover, But, trust me, daughter, 'twill not hold a husband. Juliana. Leave that to me.âAnd what should I have caught, If I had fish'd with your humility?â Some pert apprentice, or rich citizen.â Who would have bought me? Some poor gentleman, Whose high patrician blood would have descended To wed a painter's daughter and her ducats.â I felt my value, and still kept aloof, Nor stoop'd my eye till I had met the man, Pick'd from all Spain, to be my husband, girl: And him I have so manag'd, that he feels I have conferr'd an honour on his house, By coyly condescending to be his. Balthazar. He comes. Volante. Smooth your brow, sister. Juliana. For a man! He must be one not made of mortal clay, then. Enter the Duke. Oh! you are come, sir? I have waited for you!â Is this your gallantry? at such a time, too? Duke. I do intreat your pardon;âif you knew The pressing causeâ Volante. Let me intreat for him. Balthazar. Come, girl, be kind. Juliana. Well, sir, you are forgiven. Duke. You are all goodness; let me on this handâ [Taking her hand, which she withdraws. Juliana. Not yet, sir; 'tis a virgin hand as yet, And my own property:âforbear awhile, And with this humble person 'twill be yours. Duke. Exquisite modesty! Come, let us on, All things are waiting for the ceremony; And, till you grace it, Hymen's wasting torch Burns dim and sickly.âCome, my Juliana. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âA Cottage. Enter the Duke, leading in Juliana. Duke. You are welcome home. Juliana. Home! you are merry; this retired spot Would be a palace for an owl! Duke. 'Tis ours.â Juliana. Ay, for the time we stay in it.â Duke. By Heav'n, This is the noble mansion that I spoke of! Juliana. This!âyou are not in earnest, tho' you bear it With such a sober brow.âCome, come, you jest. Duke. Indeed I jest not; were it ours in jest, We should have none, wife. Juliana. Are you serious, sir? Duke. I swear, as I'm your husband, and no Duke. Juliana. No Duke! Duke. But of my own creation, lady. Juliana. Am I betray'd?âNay, do not play the fool! It is too keen a joke. Duke. You'll find it true. Juliana. You are no Duke, then? Duke. None. Juliana. Have I been cozen'd? (Aside.) And have you no estate, sir? No palaces, nor houses? Duke. None but this: A small snug dwelling, and in good repair. Juliana. Nor money, nor effects? Duke. None, that I know of. Juliana. And the attendants who have waited on usâ Duke. They were my friends; who, having done my business, Are gone about their own. Juliana. Why then 'tis clear.â(Aside.) That I was ever born!âWhat are you, sir? Duke. I am an honest manâthat may content you: Young, nor ill-favoured. Should not that content you, I am your husband, and that must content you. Juliana. I will go home! (Going.) Duke. You are at home already. (Staying her.) Juliana. I'll not endure it!âBut, remember thisâ Duke or no Duke, I'll be a Duchess, sir! Duke. A Duchess! you shall be a Queen,âto all Who, by the courtesy, will call you so. Juliana. And I will have attendance! Duke. So you shall, When you have learnt to wait upon yourself. Juliana. To wait upon myself! must I bear this? I could tear out my eyes that bade you woo me, And bite my tongue in two for saying, yes! Duke. And if you should, 'twould grow again.â I think, to be an honest yeoman's wife (For such, my would-be Duchess, you will find me), You were cut out by nature. Juliana. You will find, then, That education, sir, has spoilt me for it: Why! Do you think I'll work? Duke. I think 'twill happen, wife. Juliana. What! rub and scrub Your noble palace clean? Duke. Those taper fingers Will do it daintily. Juliana. And dress your victuals (If there be any)? Oh! I could go mad! Duke. And mend my hose, and darn my night-caps neatly; Wait, like an echo, till you're spoken toâ Juliana. Or, like a clock, talk only once an hour? Duke. Or like a dial; for that quietly Performs its work, and never speaks at all. Juliana. To feed your poultry and your hogs!âoh, monstrous! And when I stir abroad, on great occasions, Carry a squeaking tythe pig to the vicar; Or jolt with higglers' wives the market trot, To sell your eggs and butter! Duke. Excellent! How well you sum the duties of a wife! Why, what a blessing I shall have in you! Juliana. A blessing! Duke. When they talk of you and me, Darby and Joan shall be no more remembered;â We shall be happy! Juliana. Shall we? Duke. Wond'rous happy! Oh! you will make an admirable wife! Juliana. I'll make a devil. Duke. What? Juliana. A very devil. Duke. Oh, no! we'll have no devils. Juliana. I'll not bear it! I'll to my father's. Duke. Gently: you forget You are a perfect stranger to the road. Juliana. My wrongs will find a way, or make one. Duke. Softly!â You stir not hence, except to take the air; And then I'll breathe it with you. Juliana. What! confine me? Duke. 'Twould be unsafe to trust you yet abroad. Juliana. Am I a truant school-boy? Duke. Nay, not so; But you must keep your bounds. Juliana. And if I break them Perhaps you'll beat me.â Duke. No; I'll talk to you, The man that lays his hand upon a woman, Save in the way of kindness, is a wretch Whom 'twere gross flattery to name a coward.â Juliana. Well, if I may not travel to my father, I may write to him, surely!âand I willâ If I can meet within your spacious dukedom Three such unhop'd-for miracles at once As pens, and ink, and paper.â Duke. You will find them In the next room.âA word, before you go.â You are my wife, by ev'ry tie that's sacred; The partner of my fortune and my bedâ Juliana. Your fortune! Duke. Peace!âno fooling, idle woman! Beneath th' attesting eye of Heav'n I've sworn To love, to honour herish, and protect you. No human power can part us. What remains, then? To fret, and worry, and torment each other, And give a keener edge to our hard fate By sharp upbraidings and perpetual jars? Or, like a loving and a patient pair (Wak'd from a dream of grandeur to depend Upon their daily labour for support), To sooth the taste of fortune's lowliness With sweet consent and mutual fond endearment?â Now to your chamberâwrite whate'er you please; But pause before you stain the spotless paper With words that may inflame, but cannot heal! Juliana. Why, what a patient worm you take me for! Duke. I took you for a wife;âand, ere I've done, I'll know you for a good one. Juliana. You shall know me For a right woman, full of her own sex; Who, when she suffers wrong, will speak her anger; Who feels her own prerogative, and scorns By the proud reason of superior man To be taught patience, when her swelling heart Cries out revenge! [Exit. Duke (solus.) Why, let the flood rage on! There is no tide in woman's wildest passion But hath an ebb.âI've broke the ice, however.â Write to her father!âShe may write a folioâ But if she send it!â'Twill divert her spleen.â The flow of ink may save her blood-letting. Perchance she may have fits!âThey're seldom mortal, Save when the doctor's sent for.â Tho' I have heard some husbands say, and wisely, A woman's honour is her safest guard, Yet there's some virtue in a lock and key.â (Locks the door.) So, thus begins our honey moon.â'Tis well! For the first fortnight, ruder than March winds, She'll blow a hurricane. The next, perhaps, Like April, she may wear a changeful face Of storm and sunshine:âand, when that is past, She will break glorious as unclouded May; And where the thorns grew bare, the spreading blossoms Meet with no lagging frost to kill their sweetness.â Whilst others, for a month's delirious joy, Buy a dull age of penance; we, more wisely, Taste first the wholesome bitter of the cup, That after to the very lees shall relish; And to the close of this frail life prolong The pure delights of a well-govern'd marriage. [Exit. SCENE III. âBalthazar's House. Enter Balthazar, followed by the Count disguised as a Friar. Balthazar. These things premis'd, you have my full consent To try my daughter's humour:âto that end I have sent for her. But observe me, sir!â I will use no compulsion with my child; Though of a merry spirit, I have found her In weighty matters of so ripe a judgment, That she shall choose a husband for herself. If I had tendered thus her sister Zamora, I should not now have mourn'd a daughter lost! Enter Volante. Volante. What is your pleasure? Balthazar. Know this holy man; (introducing the Count to her.) It is the father Confessor I spoke of. Though he looks young, in all things which respect His sacred function, he is deeply learn'd. Volante. It is the Count! (aside.) Balthazar. I leave you to his guidance: And do not with that wild wing you are wont Fly from his questions;âact as may befit The sober purpose of his visit here; And, without diminution or concealment, Commit your actions and your private thoughts To his examination and free censure. Volante. I shall observe, sir.â [Exit Balthazar. Nay, 'tis he, I'll swear! (aside.) Count. Pray Heaven she don't suspect me!âWell, young Lady, you have heard your father's commands? Volante. Yes: and now he has left us alone, what are we to do? Count. I am to listen, and you are to confess. Volante. What! and then you are to confess, and I am to listen?âI'll take care you shall do penance though!â(aside.) Count. Pshaw! Volante. Well; but what am I to confess? Count. Your sins, daughter; your sins. Volante. What! all of them? Count. Only the great ones. Volante. The great ones! Oh, you must learn those of my neighbours, whose business it is, like yours, to confess every body's sins but their own. If now you would be content with a few trifling peccadilloes, I would own them to you with all the frankness of an author, who gives his reader the paltry errata of the press, but leaves him to find out all the capital blunders of the work himself. Count. Nay, Lady, this is trifling:âI am in haste. Volante. In haste!âthen suppose I confess my virtues? you shall have the catalogue of them in a single breath. Count. Nay, then, I must call your father. Volante. Why, then, to be serious:âIf you will tell me of any very enormous offences which I may have lately committed, I shall have no objection in the world to acknowledge them to you. Count. It is publicly reported, daughter, you are in love. Volante. So! so! are you there! (aside.) That I am in love? Count. With a manâ Volante. Why, what should a woman be in love with? Count. You interrupt me, Lady.âA young man. Volante. I'm not in love with an old one, certainly.â But is love a crime, father? Count. Heaven forbid! Volante. Why, then, you have nothing to do with it. Count. Ay, but the concealing it is a crime. Volante. Oh, the concealing it is a crime? Count. Of the first magnitude. Volante. Why, then, I confessâ Count. Well, what? Volante. That the Count Montalbanâ Count. Go on! Volante. Isâ Count. Proceed! Volante. Desperately in love with me:â Count. Pshaw! that's not to the point! Volante. Well, well, I'm coming to it:âand not being able in his own person to learn the state of my affections, has taken the benefit of clergy, and assumed the disguise of a friar. Count. Discovered! Volante. Ha, ha, ha!âYou are but a young masquerader, or you wouldn't have left your vizor at home. Come, come, Count, pull off your lion's apparel, and confess yourself an ass. Count. Nay, Volante, hear me! Volante. Not a step nearer!âThe snake is still dangerous, though he has cast his skin. I believe you're the first lover on record that ever attempted to gain the affections of his mistress by discovering her faults. Now, if you had found out more virtues in my mind than there will ever be room for, and more charms in my person than even my looking-glass can create, why then indeedâ Count. What then? Volante. Then I might have confess'd what it's now impossible I can ever confess: and so farewell, my noble Count confessor! [Exit. Count, solus. Count. Farewell! And when I've hit upon the longitude, And plumb'd the yet unfathom'd ocean, I'll make another venture for thy love.â Here comes her father.âI'll be fool'd no longer! Enter Balthazar. Balthazar. Well, sir, how thrive you? Count. E'en as I deserve: Your daughter has discovered, mock'd, and left me. Balthazar. Yet I've another scheme. Count. What is't? Balthazar. My daughter, Being a lover of my art, of late Has vehemently urg'd to see your portrait; Which, now 'tis finish'd, I stand pledg'd, she shall. Go to the picture-roomâstand there conceal'd: Here is the key. I'll send my daughter straight. And if, as we suspect, her heart leans tow'rds you, In some unguarded gesture, speech, or action, Her love will suddenly break out.âAway! I hear her coming. Count. There's some hope in this. Balthazar. It shall do wonders. Hence! [Exit Count. I'll tax her home. Enter Volante. Volante. What, is he gone, sir? Balthazar. Gone!âd'ye think the man is made of marble?âYes, he is gone. Volante. For ever? Balthazar. Ay, for ever. Volante. Alas, poor Count!âOr has he only left you To study some new character? Pray, tell me! What will he next appear in? Balthazar. This is folly. 'Tis time to call your wanton spirits home;â You are too wild of speech. Volante. My thoughts are free, sir; And those I utter. Balthazar. Far too quickly, girl: Your shrewdness is a scare-crow to your beauty. Volante. It will fright none but fools, sir: men of sense must naturally admire in us the quality they most value in themselves; a blockhead only protests against the wit of a woman, because he can't answer her drafts upon his understanding. But now we talk of the Count, don't you remember your promise, sir? Balthazar. Umph! (aside.) What promise, girl? Volante. That I should see your picture of him. Balthazar. So you shall, when you can treat the original with a little more respect. Volante. Nay, sir, a promise! Balthzar. Well, you'll find the door open:âbut, before you go, tell me honestly how do you like the Count, his person, and understanding? Volante. Why, as to his person, I don't think he's handsome enough to pine himself to death for his own shadow, like the youth in the fountainânor yet so ugly as to be frightened to dissolution, if he should look at himself in a glass. Then, as to his understanding, he has hardly wit enough to pass for a madman, nor yet so little as to be taken for a fool. In short, sir, I think the Count is very well worth any young woman's serious contemplationâwhen she has no other earthly thing to think about. [Runs off. Balthazar solus. Balthazar. So the glad bird, that flutters from the net, Grown wanton with the thought of his escape, Flies to the limed bush, and there is caught. I'll steal and watch their progress. [Exit. SCENE III. âThe Picture-Room. The Count concealed behind his Portrait. Enter Volante. Volante. Confess that I love the Count!âA woman may do a more foolish thing than fall in love with such a man, and a wiser one than to tell him of it.â (Looks at the picture.) 'Tis very like him;âthe hair is a shade too dark,âand rather too much complexion for a despairing inamorato. Confess that I love him?âNow there is only his picture, I'll see if I can't pray the confessor a little better than he did.â âDaughter, they tell me you are in love?âââWell, father, there is no harm in speaking the truth.ââ âWith the Count Montalban, daughter?âââFather, you are not a confessor but a conjuror!âââThey add, moreover, that you have nam'd the day for your marriage?â ââThere, father, you are misinformed; for, like a discreet maiden, I have left that for him to do.â âThen he should throw off his disguiseâI should gaze at him with astonishmentâhe should open his arms, whilst I sunk gently into them.â(The Count catches her in his arms.) âThe Count! (Balthazar comes forward.) My father, too! Nay, then, I am fairly hunted into the toil. There, take my hand, Count! while I am free to give it!â A Servant enters with a Letter. Servant, A letter, sir. [Exit. Balthazar. From Juliana! (Opens the letter.) Volante. Well, what says she, sir? Count. This will spoil all. (Aside.) Volante. It bears untoward news:â Is she not well, sir? Balthazar. 'Tis not that! Volante. What then, sir?â See how he knits his brow! Balthazar. Here must be throats cut. Volante. What moves you thus, sir? Balthazar. That, would stir a statue!â Your friend's a villain, sir! (To the Count.) Read, read it out.â And you, if I mistake not, are another! Volante. What can this mean? Balthazar. Peace! Hear him read the letter. Count. (Reads.) âDearest father! I am deceived, betrayed, insulted! The man whom I have married is no Duke!ââ Volante. No Duke! Balthazar. I'll be revenged!âRead, sir, read. Count. (Reads.) ââHe has neither fortune, family, nor friendsââ Balthazar. You must have known all this, sir.âBut proceed! Count. (Reads.) ââHe keeps me prisoner here, in a miserable hovel; from whence, unless I am speedily rescued by your interference, you may never hear more of your forlorn, abused âJuliana.â Balthazar. What answer you to this, sir? Count. Nothing. Volante. How! Balthazar. 'Tis plain you are a partner in the trick That robb'd a doating father of his child. Count. Suspend your anger but a few short days, And you shall find, though now a mystery Involves my friendâ Balthazar. A mystery! What mystery? There are no mysteries in honest men: What mystery, I say, can salve this conduct? Is he a Duke? Count. I cannot answer that. Balthazar. Then he's a villain! Count. Nay, upon my soul, He means you fairly, honourably, nobly. Balthazar. I will away to-night.âOlmedo! Perez! Perhaps your Countship means me fairly too, Nobly and honourably!â(Enter Servants)âGet my horses! (Exeunt.) You have some mystery! but, ere I set My sole surviving hope on such an hazard, I'll look into your Countship's pedigree: And for your noble, honourable duke, I'll travel night and day until I reach him! And he shall find I am not yet so old But that my blood will flame at such an insult, And my sword leap into my grasp. Believe me, I will have full revenge! Count. You shall. Balthazar. I will, sir! And speedily! Count. Proceed, then, on your journey. With your good leave, I'll bear you company: And as the traveller, perplex'd awhile In the benighting mazes of a forest, Breaks on a champain country, smooth and level, And sees the sun shine glorious; so shall you, sir, Behold a bright close, and a golden end, To this now dark adventure. Volante. Go, my father! Balthazar. You speak in riddles, sir; yet you speak fairly. Count. And, if I speak not truly, may my hope In this fair treasure be extinct for ever! Balthazar. Then quickly meet us here, prepar'd for travel. If, from the cloud that overhangs us now, Such light should break as you have boldly promised, My daughter and my blessing still are yours, sir. Count. Blest in that word, I quit you.â [Exit. Manent Balthazar and Volante. Balthazar. Come, girl! This shall be sifted thoroughly: till then You must remain a fresh ungather'd flow'r. Volante. Well, sir; I am not yet so overblown But I may hang some time upon the tree, And still be worth the plucking. Balthazar. True, my girl. And better 'twere to wither on thy stem, And scatter on the earth thy maiden blowings, Than graft thee where thy sweetnees and thy beauty Would all be wasted.âCome, we must prepare. [Exeunt. SCENE. âThe Cottage. Enter the Duke, in a Peasant's Dress. Duke. She hath compos'd a letter; and, what's worse, Contriv'd to send it by a village boy That pass'd the window. Yet she now appears Profoundly penitent. It cannot be; 'Tis a conversion too miraculous. Her cold disdain yields with too free a spirit; Like ice, which, melted by unnatural heatâ Not by the gradual and kindly thaw Of the resolving elementsâgive it air, Will straight congeal again.âShe comesâI'll try her. Enter Juliana. Why, what's the matter now? Juliana. That foolish letter! Duke. What! you repent of having written it? Juliana. I do, indeed. I could cut off my fingers For being partners in the act. Duke. No matter. You may indite one in a milder spirit, That shall pluck out its sting. Juliana. I will, if 'tis your pleasure. Duke. Well replied! I now see plainly you have found your wits, And are a sober, metamorphos'd woman. Juliana. I am, indeed. Duke. I know it; I can read you. There is a true contrition in your looks:â Yours is no penitence in masquerade.â You are not playing on me? Juliana. Playing, sir! Duke. You have found out the vanity of those things For which you lately sigh'd so deep? Juliana. I have, sir. Duke. A dukedom!âpshaw!âit is an idle thing. Juliana. I have begun to think so. Duke. That's a lie.â(Aside.) Is not this tranquil and retired spot More rich in real pleasures than a palace? Juliana. I like it infinitely. Duke. That's another!â(Aside.) The mansion's small, 'tis true, but very snug. Juliana. Exceeding snug! Duke. The furniture not splendid, But then all useful. Juliana. All exceeding useful; There's not a piece on't but serves twenty purposes. (Aside.) Duke. And, tho' we're seldom plagu'd by visitors, We have the best of companyâourselves.â Nor, whilst our limbs are full of active youth, Need we loll in a carriage to provoke A lazy circulation of the blood; When walking is a nobler exercise. Juliana. More wholesome, too. Duke. And far less dangerous. Juliana. That's certain! Duke. Then for servants, all agree, They are the greatest plagues on earth. Juliana. No doubt on't! Duke. Who, then, that has a taste for happiness, Would live in a large mansion, only fit To be an habitation for the winds;â Keep gilded ornaments for dust and spiders; See every body, care for nobody; Lose the free use of limbs by being mew'd up In a close carriage, next to being bed-rid, As if, like mummies, we should fall to pieces By taking air; and, above all, be pester'd With those voracious vermin call'd attendants;â When they could live as we do? Juliana. Who, indeed! Duke. Here we want nothing. Juliana. Nothing!âYes, one thing. Duke. Indeed! what's that? Juliana. You will be angry. Duke. Nay.â Not, if it be a reasonable thing. Juliana. What wants the bird who, from his wiry prison, Sings to the passing travellers of air A wistful noteâthat she were with them, sir? Duke. Umph! What, your liberty? I see it now. (Aside.) Juliana. T'were pity that in such a Paradise I should be cag'd! Duke. Why, whither would you, wife? Juliana. Only to taste the freshness of the air, That breathes a wholesome spirit from without; And weave a chaplet for you, of those flow'rs That throw their perfume through my window bars, And then I will return, sir. Duke. You are free; But use your freedom wisely. Juliana. Doubt me not, sir!â I'll use it quickly, too. (Aside, and Exit.) Duke solus. Duke. But I do doubt you.â There is a lurking devil in her eye That plays at bopeep there, in spite of her.â Her anger is but smother'dânot burnt outâ And ready, give it vent, to blaze again!â You have your liberty:âbut, like a cat, Who gives short respite to a captive mouse, I'll watch your gambols, lady.

'Sdeath, that a reasonable thinking man Should leave his friend and bottle for a woman!â Here is the Count, now, who, in other matters, Has a true judgment, only seeth his blood With a full glass beyond his usual stint; And woman, like a wildfire, runs throughout him.â Immortal man is but a shuttlecock, And wine and women are the battledores That keep him going!âWhat!

But should he view, without a tear, My altering form, my waning bloom, Then, what is left me but despair! What refuge, but the silent tomb! Rolando. It is a mournful ditty, yet 'tis pleasing! Zamora. It was, indeed, a melancholy tale From which I learnt it. Rolando. Lives it with you still? Zamora. Faintly, as would an ill-remember'd dream, sir: Yet so far I rememberâNow my heartâ(aside) 'Twas of a gentlemanâa soldier, sir, Of a brave spirit; and his outward form A frame to set a soul in. He had a page, Just such a boy as I, a faithful stripling, Who, out of pure affection, and true love, Follow'd his fortune to the wars. Rolando. Why this Is our own history. Zamora. So far, indeed, But not beyond, it bore resemblance, sir. For in the sequel (if I well remember) This loving boyâ(so, sir, the story ran)â Turn'd out to be a woman. Rolando. How! a woman? Zamora. Yes, sir, a woman. Rolando. Live with him a twelvemonth, And he not find the secret out! Zamora. 'Twas strange. Rolando. Strange! 'twas impossible! At the first blush, A palpable and most transparent lie! Why, if the soldier had been such an ass, She had herself betray'd it!â Zamora. Yet, 'tis said, She kept it to her death;âthat, oft as Love Would heave the struggling passion to her lips, Shame set a seal upon them:âthus long time She nourish'd, in this strife of love and modesty, An inward slow-consuming martyrdom, Till in the sight of him her soul most cherish'd,â Like flow'rs that on a river's margin, fading Thro' lack of moisture, drop into the stream,â So, sinking in his arms, her parting breath Reveal'd her story. Rolando. You have told it well, boy!â Zamora. I feel it deeply, sir;âI knew the lady.â Rolando. Knew her! You don't believe it? Zamora. What regards Her death, I will not vouch for. But the restâ Her hopeless love, her silent patience, The struggle 'twixt her passion and her prideâ I was a witness toâIndeed her story Is a most true one. Rolando. She should not have died!â A wench like this were worth a soldier's love: And were she living nowâ(Enter the Count.) Zamora. 'Tis well! (Aside.) Count. Strange things have happen'd, since we parted, Captain!â I must away to-night. Rolando. To-night! and whither? Count. 'Tis yet a secret. Thus much you shall know: If a short fifty miles you'll bear me company, You shall seeâ Rolando. What? Count. A woman tam'd. Rolando. No more! I'll go a hundred!âDo I know the lady? Count. What think you of our new-made Duchess?â Rolando. She? What mortal man has undertaken her?â Perhaps the keeper of the beasts, the fellow That puts his head into the lion's mouth? Or else some tiger-tamer to a nabob? Count. Who, but her husband? Rolando. With what weapons? Count. Words. Rolando. With words? why, then he must invent a language Which yet the learned have no glimpses of. Fasting and fustigation may do something; I've heard that death will quiet some of them; But words?âmere words?âcool'd by the breath of man!â He may preach tame a howling wilderness; Silence a full-mouth'd battery with snow-balls; Quench fire with oil; with his repelling breath Puff back the northern blast; whistle 'gainst thunder: These things are feasibleâBut still a woman With the nine parts of speech!â Count. You know him not. Rolando. I know the lady.âWell, it may to him Be easy, gentlemanly recreation!â But, as I hope to die a bachelor, I'd rather come within a windmill's sweep, Or pluck the lighted fuzee from a bomb (Which, to say truth, she mostly does resemble, Being stuff'd full of all things mischievous), Than parley with that woman.â Could he discourse with fluent eloquence More languages than Babel sent abroad, The simple rhet'rick of her mother tongue Would pose him presently; for woman's voice Sounds like a fiddle in a concert, always The shrillest, if not loudest, instrument. Count. Yet, I tell you He has the trick to draw the serpent's fang, And yet not spoil her beauty. Rolando. We shall see.â You'll follow us, Eugenio. [Exeunt Count &amp; Rolando. Eugenio. He was touch'd surely with the piteous tale Which I delivered; and, but that the Count Prevented him, would have broke freely out Into a full confession of his feeling Tow'rds such a woman as I painted to him.â Why then, my boy's habiliments, adieu! Henceforth, my woman's tyreâI'll trust to you! [Exit. SCENE II. âThe Duke's Palace. Enter Campillo, the Duke's Steward, and another Servant. Servant. But can no one tell the meaning of this fancy? Campillo. No: 'tis the Duke's pleasure, and that's enough for us. You shall hear his own words:â âFor reasons that I shall hereafter communicate, it is necessary that Jaquez should, in all things, at present, act as my representative: you will, therefore, command my household to obey him as myself, until you hear further from (Signed) Aranza.â Servant. Well, we must wait the upshot. But how bears Jaquez his new dignity? Campillo. Like most men in whom sudden fortune combats against long-establish'd habit. [Laughing without. Servant. By their merriment, this should be he. Campillo. Stand aside, and let us note him. Jaquez enters dressed as the Duke, followed by Attendants, who in vain endeavour to restrain their laughter. Jaquez. Why, you ragamuffins! what d'ye titter at? Am I the first great man that has been made off-hand by a taylor? Shew your grinders again, and I'll hang you like onions, fifty on a rope. I can't think what they see ridiculous about me, except, indeed, that I feel as if I was in armour, and my sword has a trick of getting between my legs like a monkey's tail, as if it was determined to trip up my nobility.âAnd now, villains! don't let me see you tip the wink to each other, as I do the honours of my table. If I tell one of my best stories, don't any of you laugh before the jest comes out, to shew that you have heard it before:â take care that you don't call me by my christian name, and then pretend it was by accident;âthat shall be transportation at least:âand when I drink a health to all friends, don't fancy that any of you are in the number. (Enter a Servant.) Well, sir? Servant. There is a lady without presses vehemently to speak to your Grace. Jaques. A lady? Servant. Yes, your Highness! Jaquez. Is she young? Servant. Very, your Grace! Jaquez. Handsome? Servant. Beautiful, your Highness! Jaquez. Send her in.â[Exit Servant.]âYou may retire; I'll finish my instructions bye-and-bye. âYoung and handsome? I'll attend to her business in propria persona. Your old and ugly ones I shall dispatch by deputy. Now to alarm her with my consequence, and then sooth her with my condescension. I must appear important; big as a country pedagogue when he enters the school-room with a hem! and terrifies the apple-munching urchins with the creaking of his shoes. I'll swell like a shirt bleaching in a high wind; and look burly as a Sunday beadle, when he has kick'd down the unhallow'd stall of a profane old apple woman.âBring my chair of state!âHush! Enter Juliana. Juliana. I come, great Duke, for justice! Jaquez. You shall have it. Of what do you complain? Juliana. My husband, sir! Jaquez. I'll hang him instantly!âWhat's his offence? Juliana. He has deceiv'd me. Jaquez. A very common case;âfew husbands answer their wives' expectations. Juliana. He has abus'd your Graceâ Jaquez. Indeed! if he has done that, he swings most loftily. But how, lady, how? Juliana. Shortly thus, sir: Being no better than a low-born peasant, He has assum'd your character and personâ (Enter the Duke.) Oh! you are here, sir? This is he, my Lord. Jaquez. Indeed! (Aside) Then I must tickle him.â Why, fellow, d'ye take this for an alehouse, that you enter with such a swagger?âKnow you where you are, sir? Duke. The rogue reproves me well! (aside.) I had forgot. Most humbly I intreat your Grace's pardon For this unusher'd visit; but the fear Of what this wayward woman might allege Beyond the truthâ Juliana. I have spoke nought but truth.â Duke. Has made me thus Unmannerly. Jaquez. 'Tis wellâyou might have us'd more ceremony. Proceed. (To Juliana.) Juliana. This man, my Lord, as I was saying, Passing himself upon my inexperience For the right owner of this sumptuous palace, Obtain'd my slow consent to be his wife; And cheated, by this shameful perfidy, Me of my hopesâmy father of his child. Jaquez. Why, this is swindling;âobtaining another man's goods under false pretences,âthat is, if a woman be a goodâThat will make a very intricate point for the Judges.âWell, sir, what have you to say in your defence? Duke. I do confess I put this trick upon her; And for my transient usurpation Of your most noble person, with contrition I bow me to the rigour of the law.â But for the lady, sir, she can't complain. Juliana. How! not complain? To be thus vilely cozen'd, And not complain! Jaquez. Peace, woman!âTho' Justice be blind, she is not deaf. Duke. He does it to the life! (Aside.) Had not her most exceeding pride been doting, She might have seen the diff'rence at a glance, Between your Grace and such a man as I am. Jaquez. She might have seen that, certainly.â Proceed. Duke. Nor did I fall so much beneath her sphere Being what I am, as she had soar'd above it Had I been that which I have only feign'd. Jaquez. Yet, you deceiv'd her? Juliana. Let him answer that! Duke. I did: most men in something cheat their wives; Wives gull their husbands; 'tis the course of wooing. Now, bating that my title and my fortune Were evanescent, in all others things I acted like a plain and honest suitor. I told her she was fair, but very proud; That she had taste in music, but no voice; That she danc'd well, yet still might borrow grace From such or such a lady. To be brief; I prais'd her for no quality she had not, Nor over-priz'd the talents she possess'd: And for myself, I plac'd before her eyes, Without extenuation or enlargement, The thing which honest nature stampt me first, And modest culture has since brought me to.â Now, save in what I have before confess'd, I challenge her worst spite to answer me, Whether, in all attentions, which a womanâ A gentle and a reasonable womanâ Looks for, I have not to the height fulfill'd, If not outgone, her expectations? Jaquez. Why, if she has no cause of complaint since you were marriedâ Duke. I dare her to the proof on't. Jaquez. Is it so? (To Juliana.) Juliana. I don't complain of what has happen'd since; The man has made a tolerable husband. But for the monstrous cheat he put upon me, I claim to be divorc'd. Jaquez. It cannot be! Juliana. Cannot! my Lord? Jaquez. No. You must live with him! Juliana. Never! Duke. Or, if your Grace will give me leaveâ We have been wedded yet a few short daysâ Let us wear out a month as man and wife; If at the end on't, with uplifted hands, Morning and ev'ning, and sometimes at noon, And bended knees, she doesn't plead more warmly Than ere she prayed 'gainst stale virginity, To keep me for her husbandâ Juliana. If I do!â Duke. Then let her will be done, that seeks to part us! Juliana. I do implore your grace to let it stand Upon that footing! Jaquez. Humph!âwell, it shall be so!âwith this proviso, that either of you are at liberty to hang yourselves in the mean time. Duke. We thank your providence.âCome, Julianaâ Juliana. Well, there's my handâa month's soon past, and thenâ I am your humble servant, sir. Duke. For ever. Juliana. Nay, I'll be hang'd first. Duke. That may do as well! Come, you'll think better on't! Juliana. By allâ Duke. No swearing.â We humbly take our leaves. [Exeunt the Duke and Juliana. Jaquez solus. I begin to find, by the strength of my nerves and the steadiness of my countenance, that I was certainly intended for a great man;âfor what more does it require to be a great man, than boldly to put on the appearance of it?âHow many sage Politicians are there, who can scarce comprehend the mystery of a mouse-trap;âvaliant Generals, who wouldn't attack a bulrush, unless the wind were in in their favour;âprofound Lawyers, who would make excellent wig-blocks;âand skilful Physicians, whose knowledge extends no furtherâthan writing death-warrants in Latin; and are shining examples, that a man will never want gold in his pocket, who carries plenty of brass in his face!âIt will be rather awkward, to be sure, to resign at the end of a month:â but, like other great men in office, I must make the most of my time, and retire with a good grace, to avoid being turned outâas a well-bred dog always walks down stairs, when he sees preparation ripe for kicking him into the street. [Exit. SCENE. âAn Inn. Enter Balthazar, as having fallen from his Horse, supported by Volante, the Count, &amp;c. and preceded by Hostess and Attendants. Hostess. This way, this way, if you please.âAlas! poor gentleman! (Brings a chair.) How do you feel now, sir? (They set him down.) Balthazar. I almost think my brains are where they should beâ Confound the jade!âtho' they dance merrily To their own music. Count. Is a surgeon sent for? Hostess. Here he comes, sir. Enter Lampedo. Lampedo. Is this the gentleman? Balthazar. I want no surgeon; all my bones are whole. Volante. Pray, take advice! Balthazar. Well!âDoctor, I have doubts Whether my soul be shaken from my body,â Else I am whole. Lampedo. Then you are safe, depend on't; Your soul and body are not yet divorc'dâ Tho' if they were, we have a remedy.â Nor have you fracture, sir, simple or compound;â Yet very feverish! I begin to fear Some inward bruiseâa very raging pulse!â We must phlebotomize! Balthazar. You won't! Already There is too little blood in these old veins To do my cause full justice. Lampedo. Quick, and feverish!â He must lie down a little; for as yet, His blood and spirits being all in motion, There is too great confusion in the symptoms To judge discreetly from. Balthazar. I'll not lie down! Volante. Nay; for an hour or so! Balthazar. Well, be it so. Hostess. I'll shew you to a chamber; this way, this way, if you please. [Exeunt all but Lampedo. Lampedo solus. 'Tis the first patient, save the miller's mare, And an old lady's cat that has the phthisic, That I have touch'd these six weeks.âWell, good Hostess! (Enter Hostess.) How fares your guest? Hostess. He must not go to-night! Lampedo. Noânor to-morrowâ Hostess. Nor the next day, neither! Lampedo. Leave that to me.â Hostess. He has no hurt, I fear. Lampedo. None:âbut, as you're his cook, and I'm his doctor, Such things may happen.âYou must make him ill, And I must keep him soâfor, to say truth, 'Tis the first biped customer I've handled This many a day:âthey fall but slowly in,â Like the subscribers to my work on fevers.â Hostess. Hard times indees!âno business stirring my way. Lampedo. So I should guess, from your appearance, Hostess. You look as if, for lack of company, You were obliged to eat up your whole larder. Hostess. Alas! 'tis soâ Yet I contrive to keep my spirits up. Lampedo. Yes; and your flesh too.âLook at me! Hostess. Why, truly, You look half starv'd Lampedo. Half starv'd! I wish you'd tell me Which half of me is fed. I shew more points Than an old horse, that has been three weeks poundedâ Yet I do all to tempt them into sickness. Have I not, in the jaws of bankruptcy, And to the desolation of my person, Painted my shop, that it looks like a rainbow?â New double-gilt my pestle and my mortar, That some, at distance, take't for a new planet? And blaz'd in flaming letters o'er my door, Each one a glorious constellation, Surgeon, apothecary, accoucheurâ (For midwife is grown vulgar)?âYet they ail not: Phials and gallipots still keep their ranks, As if there was no cordial virtue in them. The healing chime of pulverising drugs They shun as 'twere a tolling bell, or death-watch. I never give a dose, or set a limb!â But, come, we must devise, we must devise How to make much of this same guest, sweet Hostess. Hostess. You know I always make the most of them. Lampedo. Spoke like an antient tapstress!âCome, let's inâ And, whilst I sooth my bowels with an omelette (For, like a nest of new-wak'd rookings, Hostess, They caw for provender), and take a glass Of thy Falernianâwe will think of means; For tho' to cure men be beyond our skill, 'Tis hard indeed if we can't keep them ill. [Exeunt. SCENE. âThe Cottage. Enter the Duke, bringing in Juliana. Duke. Nay, no resistance!âfor a month, at least, I am your husband. Juliana. True!âand what's a husband? Duke. Why, as some wives would metamorphose him, A very miserable ass indeed!â A sweating slave to dig the precious ore Which their high-feeding vanities make current; A fence to stand betwixt them and dishonour, Which if their bounding wantonness o'erleapsâ A thing more loathsome and detestable!â Mere fuller's earth to bleach their spotted credit, And blotting paper to drink up their stains! Juliana. True, there are many such. Duke. And there are men Whom not a swelling lip, or wrinkled brow, Or the loud rattle of a woman's tongueâ Or, what's more hard to parry, the warm pressure Of lips, that from the inmost heart of man Pluck out his stern'st resolvesâcan move one jot From the determin'd purpose of his soul, Or stir an inch from his prerogative.â E'er it be long, you'll dream of such a man. Juliana. Where, waking, shall I see him? Duke. Look on me! Come to your chamber! Juliana. I won't be confin'd! Duke. Won't!âSay you so? Juliana. Well, then, I do request You won't confine me! Duke. You'll leave me? Juliana. No, indeed! As there is truth in language, on my soul I will not leave you! Duke. You've deceiv'd me onceâ Juliana. And therefore do not merit to be trusted. I do confess it:âbut, by all that's sacred, Give me my liberty, and I will be A patient, drudging, most obedient wife! Duke. Yes; but a grumbling one? Juliana. No; on my honour, I will do all you ask, ere you have said it. Duke. And with no secret murmur of your spirit? Juliana. With none, believe me! Duke. Have a care! For if I catch ye on the wing again, I'll clip ye closer than a garden hawk, And put ye in a cage where daylight comes not; Where you may fret your pride against the bars Until your heart break. See who's at the door! (Knocking at the door. She opens the door.) (Enter Lopez.) My neighbour Lopez!âWelcome, sir!âMy wifeâ (introducing her.) A chair! (To Juliana.) Your pardonâyou'll excuse her, sirâ A little awkward, but exceeding willing. (She brings in a chair.) One for your husband!âPray be seated, neighbour!â Now, you may serve yorself. Juliana. I thank you, sir, I'd rather stand. Duke. I'd rather you should it. Juliana. If you will have it soâWould I were dead!â(Aside. She brings a chair, and sits down.) Duke. Tho', now I think again, 'tis fit you stand, That you may be more free to serve our guest. Juliana. Even as you command! (Rises.) Duke. You will eat something? (To Lopez.) Lopez. Not a morsel, thank ye. Duke. Then, you will drink?âa glass of wine, at least? Lopez. Well, I am warm with walking, and care not if I do taste your liquor. Duke. You have some wine, wife? Juliana. I must e'en submit! [Exit. Duke. This visit, sir, is kind and neighbourly. Lopez. I came to ask a favour of you. We have to-day a sort of merry-making on the green hard byâ'twere too much to call it a danceâand as you are a stranger hereâ Enter Juliana, with a horn of liquor. Duke. (Taking it.) What have we here? Juliana. 'Tis wineâYou call'd for wine! Duke. And did I bid you bring it in a nutshell? Lopez. Nay, there is plenty! Duke. I can't suffer it. You must excuse me.â(To Lopez.) When friends drink with us, 'Tis usual, love, to bring it in a jug, Or else they may suspect we grudge our liquor. You understand! A jug! Juliana. I shall remember. [Exit. Lopez. I am asham'd to give you so much trouble! Duke. No trouble; she must learn her duty, sir: I'm only sorry you should be kept waiting.â But you were speakingâ Lopez. As I was saying, it being the conclusion of our vintage, we have assembled the lads and lasses of the villageâ Enter Juliana. Duke. Now we shall do! (Pours out.) Why, what the devil's this? Juliana. Wine, sir! Duke. This wine?âTis foul as ditch-water!â Did you shake the cask? Juliana. What shall I say? (Aside.) Yes, sir. Duke. You did? Juliana. I did. Duke. I thought so. Why, do you think, my love, that wine is physic, That must be shook before 'tis swallow'd?â Come, try again! Juliana. I'll go no more! Duke. You won't? Juliana. I won't! Duke. You won't! (Shewing the key.) You had forgot yourself, my love! Juliana. Well, I obey! [Exit. Duke. Was ever man so plagued! You have a wife, no doubt, of more experience, Who would not by her awkwardness disgrace Herself or husband thus? This 'tis to marry An inexperienc'd girl! (Enter Juliana.) Ay, this looks well! Juliana. The heavens be prais'd! Duke. Come, sir, your judgment? Lopez. 'Tis excellent!âBut, as I was saying, to-day we have some country pastimes on the green.â Will it please you both to join our simple recreations? Duke. We will attend you. Come, renew your draught, sir! Lopez. We shall expect you presently:âtill then, good even, sir. Duke. Good even, neighbour. (Exit Lopez.) Go and make you ready. Juliana. I take no pleasure in these rural sports. Duke. Then you shall go to please your husband.âHold! I'll have no glittering gewgaws stuck about you, To stretch the gaping eyes of ideot wonder, And make men stare upon a piece of earth As on the star-wrought firmamentâno feathers To wave as streamers to your vanityâ Nor cumbrous silk, that, with its rustling sound, Makes proud the flesh that bears it. She's adorn'd Amply, that in her husband's eye looks lovelyâ The truest mirror that an honest wife Can see her beauty in! Juliana. I shall observe, sir. Duke. I should like well to see you in the dress I last presented you. Juliana. The blue one, sir?â Duke. No, love, the white.âThus modestly attir'd, An half-blown rose stuck in thy braided hair, With no more diamonds than those eyes are made of, No deeper rubies than compose thy lips, Nor pearls more precious than inhabit them; With the pure red and white, which that same hand That blends the rainbow mingles in thy cheeks, This well-proportion'd form (think not I flatter) In graceful motion to harmonious sounds, And thy free tresses dancing in the wind;â Thou'lt fix as much observance, as chaste dames Can meet, without a blush. [Exit Juliana. Duke solus. I'll trust her with these bumpkins. There no coxcomb Shall buz his fulsome praises in her ear, And swear she has in all things, save myself, A most especial taste. No meddling gossip (Who, having claw'd or cuddled into bondage The thing misnam'd a husband, privately Instructs less daring spirits to revolt) Shall, from the fund of her experience, teach her When lordly man can best be made a fool of; And how, and when, and where, with most success, Domestic treaties, on the woman's side, Are made and ratified.â Ye that would have obedient wives, beware Of meddling woman's kind officious care. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âThe Inn. Enter Hostess followed by Lampedo. Hostess. Nay, nay, another fortnight. Lamp. It can't be. The man 's as well as I am:âhave some mercy!â He hath been here almost three weeks already. Host. Well, then, a week.â Lamp. We may a week detain him! (Enter Balthazar behind, in his nightgown, with a drawn sword.) You talk now like a reasonable hostess, That sometimes has a reck'ningâwith her conscience. Host. He still believes he has an inward bruise. Lamp. I would to heaven he had! or that he'd slipt His shoulder-blade, or broke a leg or two (Not that I bear his person any malice), Or lux'd an arm, or even sprain'd his ancle! Host. Ay, broken any thing except his neck. Lamp. However, for a week I'll manage him. Tho' he has the constitution of a horseâ A farrier should prescribe for him! Balth. A farrier! (Aside.) Lamp. To-morrow we phlebotomize again; Next day my new-invented patent draught:â I've tried it on a dog.âThen I have some pills prepar'd. On Thursday we throw in the bark; on Fridayâ Balth. (Coming forward.) Well, sir, on Friday?âwhat on Friday? come, Proceedâ Lamp. Discovered! Hostess. Mercy, noble sir! (They fall on their knees.) Lampedo. We crave your mercy! Balthazar. On your knees, 't is well: Pray; for your time is short. Hostess. Nay, do not kill us! Balthazar. You have been tried, condemned, and only wait For execution. Which shall I begin with? Lampedo. The lady, by all means, sir! Balthazar. Come, prepare. (To the Hostess.) Hostess. Have pity on the weakness of my sex! Balthazar. Tell me, thou quaking mountain of gross flesh, Tell me, and in a breath, how many poisonsâ If you attempt itâ(To Lampedo, who is endeavouring to make off)âyou have cook'd up for me. Hostess. None, as I hope for mercy! Balthazar. Is not thy wine a poison? Hostess. No, indeed, sir! 'T is not, I own, of the first quality; Butâ Balthazar. What? Hostess. I always give short measure, sir, And ease my conscience that way. Balthazar. Ease your conscience! I'll ease your conscience for you! Hostess. Mercy, sir! Balthazar. Rise, if thou canst, and hear me. Hostess. Your commands, sir? Balthazar. If in five minutes all things are prepared For my departure, you may yet survive. Hostess. It shall be done in less. Balthazar. Away, thou lump-fish! [Exit Hostess. Lampedo. So now comes my turn!â't is all over with me!â There 's dagger, rope, and ratsbane, in his looks! Balthazar. And now, thou sketch and outline of a man! Thou thing that hast no shadow in the sun! Thou eel in a consumption, eldest born Of Death on Famine! thou anatomy Of a starv'd pilchard!â Lampedo. I do confess my leanness.âI am spare! And therefore spare me! Balthazar. Why! wouldst thou have made me A thoroughfare for thy whole shop to pass thro'? Lampedo. Man, you know, must live!â Balthazar. Yes: he must die, too. Lampedo. For my patients' sake!â Balthazar. I'll send you to the major part of them.â The window, sir, is open;âcome, prepare.â Lampedo. Pray, consider! I may hurt some one in the street. Balthazar. Why then I'll rattle thee to pieces in a dice-box, Or grind thee in a coffee-mill to powder; For thou must sup with Pluto:âSo, make ready! Whilst I, with this good small-sword for a lancet, Let thy starv'd spirit outâfor blood thou hast noneâ And nail thee to the wall, where thou shalt look Like a dry'd beetle with a pin struck thro' him. Lampedo. Consider my poor wife! Balthazar. Thy wife! Lampedo. My wife, sir! Balthazar. Hast thou dar'd think of matrimony, too? No flesh upon thy bones, and take a wife! Lampedo. I took a wife because I wanted flesh. I have a wife, and three angelic babes, Who, by those looks, are well nigh fatherless! Balthazar. Well, well! your wife your wife and children shall plead for you. Come, come! the pills! where are the pills? produce them! Lampedo. Here is the box. Balthazar. Were it Pandora's, and each single pill Had ten diseases in it, you should take them. Lampedo. What, all? Balthazar. Ay, all; and quickly too:âCome, sir, begin! That 's well;âanother. Lampedo. One's a dose! Balthazar. Proceed, sir! Lampedo. What will become of me? I do beseech you, let me have some drink! Some cooling liquid, sir, to wash them down! Balthazar. Oh, yesâProduce the phial! Lampedo. Mercy on me! Balthazar. Come, sir, your new-invented patent draught! You've tried it on a dog; so there is no danger. Lampedo. If you have any bowels, think of mine Balthazar. Nay, no demur! Lampedo. May I entreat to make my will first? Balthazar. No: you have nought but physic to bequeath; And that no one will take, tho' you should leave it. Lampedo. Just to step home and see my wife and children?â Balthazar. No, sir. Lampedo. Let me go home, and set my shop to rights, And, like immortal CÃ¦sar, die with decency!â Balthazar. Away! and thank thy lucky star I have not Bray'd thee in thine own mortar, or expos'd thee For a large specimen of the lizard genus. Lampedo. Would I were one!âfor they can feed on air. Balthazar. Home, sir! and be more honest! [Exit. Lampedo. If I am not, I'll be more wise at least! [Exit. SCENE II. âA Wood. Enter Zamora, in woman's apparel, veiled. Zamora. Now, all good spirits that delight to prosper The undertakings of chaste love, assist me!â Yonder he comes: I'll rest upon this bank.â If I can move his curiosity, The rest may follow. (She reclines upon the bank, pretending sleep.) Enter Rolando. Rolando. What, hoa! Eugenio! He is so little apt to play the truant, I fear some mischief has befallen him. (Sees Zamora.) What have we here?âa woman!âBy this light, Or rather by this darkness, 'tis a woman!â Doing no mischief,âonly dreaming of it!â It is the stillest, most inviting spot! We are alone!âif, without waking her, I could just brush the fresh dew from her lips, As the first blush of morn salutes the roseâ Hold, hold, Rolando! art thou not forsworn If thou but touchest even the finger's end Of fickle woman?âI have sworn an oath That female flesh and blood should ne'er provoke me;â That is, in towns, or cities: I remember There was a special clause,âor should have been,â Touching a woman sleeping in a wood: For tho', to the strict letter of the law, We bind our neighbours; yet, in our own cause, We give a liberal and large construction To its free spirit. Therefore, gentle ladyâ (She stirs, as if awaking.) Hush!âshe prevents me. Pardon, gentle fair-one, That I have broke thus rudely on your slumbers. But, for the interruption I have caused, You see me ready, as a gentleman, To make you all amends. Zamora. To a stranger You offer fairly, sir; but from a strangerâ Rolando. What shall I say?âNot so; you are no stranger. Zamora. Do you then know me?âHeav'n forbid! (Aside.) Rolando. Too well. Zamora. How, sir? Rolando. I've known you, lady, 'bove a twelve-month; And, from report, lov'd you an age before. Why is it possible you never heard Of my sad passion? Zamora. Never. Rolando. You amaze me! Zamora. What can he mean? (Aside.) Rolando. The sonnets I have written to your beauty Have kept a paper-mill in full employ: And then the letters I have giv'n by dozens Unto your chambermaid!âbut I begin, By this unlook'd-for strangeness you put on, Almost to think she ne'er delivered them.â Zamora. Indeed she never did.âHe does but jest. (Aside.) I'll try. (Aside.) Perhaps you misdirected them. What superscription did you put upon them? Rolando. What superscription?âNone! Zamora. None! Rolando. Not a tittle! Think ye, fair lady, I have no discretion?â I left a blank, that, should they be mislaid, Or lost, you knowâ Zamora. And in your sonnets, sir, What title was I honour'd by? Rolando. An hundred!â All but your real one. Zamora. What is that? (Quickly.) Rolando. She has me.â Faith, lady, you have run me to a stand.â I know you not; never before beheld you; Yet I'm in love with you extempore: And tho', by a tremendous oath, I'm bound Never to hold communion with your sex, Yet has your beauty, and your modestyâ Come, let me see your faceâ Zamora. Nay; that would prove I had no modesty, perhaps, nor beauty.â Besides, I too have taken a rash oath, Never to love but one manâ Rolando. At a time? Zamora. One at all times. Rolando. You're right:âI am the man. Zamora. You are indeed, sir! Rolando. How! now you are jesting! Zamora. No, on my soul!âI have sent up to heav'n A sacred and irrevocable vow; And if, as some believe, there does exist A spirit in the waving of the woods, Life in the leaping torrent, in the hills And seated rocks a contemplating soul Brooding on all things round them, to all nature I here renew the solemn covenantâ Never to love but you, sir. Rolando. And who are you? Zamora. In birth and breeding, sir, a gentlewoman: And, but I know the high pitch of your mind From such low thoughts maintains a tow'ring distance, I would add, rich; yet is it no misfortune.â Virtuous, I will say boldly. Of my shape, Your eyes are your informers. For my face, I cannot think of that so very meanly, For you have often prais'd it. Rolando. I!âUnveil, then, That I may praise it once again. (Volante enters.) Zamora. Not now, sir, We are observed. Rolando. (Seeing Volante) Confusion!âthis she-devil!â 'Tis time, then, to redeem my character.â I tell you, lady, you must be mistaken, I'm not the man you want. (To Zamora). Meet me to-night. (Aside.) Will not that answer serve?âAt eight precisely. (Aside.) I tell you 'tis not I. (Aloud.) Here; on this spot. (Aside.) Zamora. I humbly beg your pardon. Rolando. Well, you have it;â Remember.â Zamora. Trust me! [Exit. Rolando. A most strange adventure! Pray, lady, do you know who that importunate woman in that just left us? Volante. No, signor. Rolando. (They walk by each other, he whistling, and she humming a tune.) Have you any business with me? Volante. I wanted to see you, that's all. They tell me you are the valiant captain that have turn'd woman-hater, as the boy left off eating nuts because he met with a sour one. Rolando. Would I were in a freemasons' lodge! Volante. Why there? Rolando. They never admit women. Volante. It must be a dull place. Rolando. Exceeding quiet.âHow shall I shake off this gadfly?âDid you ever see a man mad? Volante. Never. Rolando. I shall be mad presently. Volante. I hope it wont be long first. I can wait an hour or so. Rolando. I tell you I shall be mad! Volante. Will it be of the merry sort? Rolando. Stark staring, maliciously, mischievously mad! Volante. Nay, then I can't think of leaving you; for you'll want a keeper. Rolando. Would thou hadst one!âIf it were valiant now to beat a womanâ Volante. Well! why don't you begin? Pshaw! you have none of the right symptoms: you don't stare with your eyes, nor foam at the mouth.â Mad, indeed! You're as much in your sober senses as I am! Rolando. Then am I mad incurably! Will you go forward? Volante. No. Rolando. Backward? Volante. No. Rolando. Will you stay where you are? Volante. No. Rank and file, captain:âI mean to be one of your company. Rolando. Impossible! You're not tall enough for any thing but a drummer: and then the noise of your tongue would drown the stoutest sheepskin in Christendom. Volante. Can you find any employment for me? Rolando. No: you are fit for nothing but to beat hemp in a workhouse, to the tuneful accompaniment of a beadle's whip. Volante. I could be content to be so employed, if I was sure you would reap the full benefit of my labour. Rolando. Nay, then I'll go another way to work with you, madam.âWhat, hoa, Eugenio! serjeant! corporal! Volante. Nay, then 'tis time to scamper: he's bringing his whole regiment on me! [Exit. Rolando. She's gone; and has left me happy.â But this other:âHow is her absence irksome! There is such magick in her graceful form, Such sweet persuasion in her gentle tongue, As thaws my firm resolves, and changes me To that same soft and pliant thing I was E'er yet a haughty woman's scorn had stung me. [Exit. SCENE III. âA rural scene. A Dance of Rustics. Lopez seeing the Duke and Juliana approach. Lopez. Hold!âour new guests. (Enter the Duke and Juliana.) Neighbours, you're kindly welcome. Will't please you join the dance, or be mere gazers? Duke. I am for motion, if this lady here Would trip it with me. Lopez. My wife, sirâat your service! If it be no offence, I'll take a turn With yours. Duke. By all means. Lady, by your leaveâ Lopez. A good exampleâ (Attempts to salute Juliana;âshe boxes his ears.) Juliana. Badly follow'd, sir! Lopez. Zounds! what a tingler! Duke. Are you not asham'd? (To Jul.) My wife is young, sir; she'll know better soon Than to return a courtesy so tartly:â Yours has been better tutor'd. Lopez. Tutor'd! Zounds!â I only meant to ape your husband, lady! He kisses where he pleases.â Juliana. So do I, sir! Not where I have no pleasure. Duke. Excellent! (Aside.) Juliana. My lips are not my own. My hand is free, sir. (Offering it.) Lopez. Free! I'll be sworn it is! Juliana. Will 't please you take it? Duke. Excuse her rustic breeding: she is young; And you will find her nimble in the dance. Lopez. Come, then, let's have a stirring roundelay. [They dance; Juliana at first perversely, but afterwards entering into the spirit of it; and then go off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âThe Cottage. Juliana, sitting at her needle, sings; during which the Duke steals in behind. SONG. At the front of a cottage with woodbine grown o'er Fair Lucy sat turning her wheel, Unconscious that William was just at the door, And heard her her passion reveal. The bells rung, And she sung Ding, dong, dell, It were well If they rung for dear William and me. But when she look'd up, and her lover espy'd, Ah! what was the maiden's surprise! She blush'd as he woo'd her and call'd her his bride, And answer'd him only with sighs. The bells rung And she sung, Ding, dong, dell, It is well! They shall ring for dear William and me! Duke. Ay, this looks well, when, like the humming bee, We lighten labour with a cheerful song. Come, no more work to night!â(sits by her.) It is the last That we shall spend beneath this humble roof: Our fleeting month of trial being past, To-morrow you are free. Juliana. Nay, now you mock me, And turn my thoughts upon my former follies. You know, that, to be mistress of the world, I would not leave you. Duke. No! Juliana. No, on my honour. Duke. I think you like me better than you did!â And yet 't is natural: Come, come, be honest; You have a sort of hank'ring,âno wild wish, Or vehement desire, yet a slight longing, A simple preferenceâif you had your choice,â To be a duchess, rather than the wife Of a low peasant?â Juliana. No, indeed you wrong me! Duke. I mark'd you closely at the palace, wife. In the full tempest of your speech, your eye Would glance to take the room's dimensions, And pause upon each ornament; and then There would break from you a half-smother'd sigh, Which spoke distinctlyââthese should have been mine.â And therefore, though with a well-temper'd spirit, You have some secret swellings of the heart When these things rise to your imagination. Juliana. No, never: sometimes in my dreams, indeed,â You know we cannot help our dreams!â Duke. What then? Juliana. Why, I confess that sometimes, in my dreams, A noble house and splendid equipage, Diamonds and pearls, and gilded furniture, Will glitter, like an empty pageant, by me; And then I'm apt to rise a little feverish. But never do my sober waking thoughts,â As I'm a woman worthy of belief,â Wander to such forbidden vanities. Yet, after all, it was a scurvy trickâ Your palace, and your pictures, and your plate; Your fine plantations, your delightful gardens, That were a second Paradiseâfor fools; And then your grotto, so divinely cool; Your Gothic summer-house, and Roman temple; 'T would puzzle much an antiquarian To find out their remains!â Duke. No more of that! Juliana. You had a dozen spacious vineyards, too;â Alas! the grapes are sour;âand, above all, The Barbary courser, that was breaking for meâ Duke. Nay, you shall ride him yet. Juliana. Indeed! Duke. Believe me, We must forget these things. Juliana. They are forgot. And by this kiss we'll think of them no more, But when we want a theme to make us merry. Duke. It was an honest one, and spoke thy soul; And by the fresh lip and unsullied breath, Which join'd to give it sweetnessâ Enter Balthazar. Juliana. How! my father! Duke. Signor Balthazar! You are welcome, sir, To our poor habitation. Balthazar. Welcome, villain? I come to call your dukeship to account, And to reclaim my daughter. Duke. You will find her Reclaim'd already:âor I've lost my pains. (Aside.) Balthazar. Let me come at him! Juliana. Patience, my dear father! Duke. Nay, give him room. Put up your weapon, sirâ 'T is the worst argument a man can use; So let it be the last! As for your daughter, She passes by another title here, In which your whole authority is sunkâ My lawful wife. Balthazar. Lawful!âhis lawful wife! I shall go mad. Did you not basely steal her, Under a vile pretence? Duke. What I have done I'll answer to the law.â Of what do you complain? Balthazar. Are you not A most notorious self-confess'd impostor? Duke. True!âI am somewhat what dwindled from the state In which you lately knew me; nor alone Should my exceeding change provoke your wonder, You'll find your daughter is not what she was. Balthazar. How, Juliana? Juliana. 'Tis indeed most true. I left you, sir, a froward foolish girl, Full of capricious thoughts and fiery spirits, Which, without judgment, I would vent on all. But I have learnt this truth indelibly,â That modesty, in deed, in word, and thought, Is the prime grace of woman; and with that, More than by frowning looks and saucy speeches, She may persuade the man that rightly loves her, Whom she was ne'er intended to command. Balthazar. Amazement! Why, this metamorphosis Exceeds his own!âWhat spells, what cunning witchcraft Has he employ'd? Juliana. None: he has simply taught me To look into myself: his powerful rhet'ric Hath with strong influence impress'd my heart, And made me see at length the thing I have been, And what I am, sir. Balthazar. Are you then content To live with him? Juliana. Content?âI am most happy! Balthazar. Can you forget your crying wrongs? Juliana. Not quite, sir: They sometimes serve us to make merry with. Balthazar. How like a villain he abus'd your father? Juliana. You will forgive him that for my sake! Balthazar. Never! Duke. Why, then, 't is plain, you seek your own revenge, And not your daughter's happiness! Balthazar. No matter I charge you, on your duty as my daughter, Follow me! Duke. On a wife's obedience, I charge you, stir not! Juliana. You, sir, are my father; At the bare mention of that hallow'd name, A thousand recollections rise within me, To witness you have ever been a kind one:â This is my husband, sir! Balthazar. Thy husband; wellâ Juliana. 'T is fruitless now to think upon the means He us'dâI am irrevocably his: And when he pluck'd me from my parent tree To graft me on himself, he gather'd with me My love, my duty, my obedience; And, by adoption, I am bound as strictly To do his reasonable bidding now, As once to follow yours. Duke. Most excellent! (Aside.) Balthazar. Yet I will be reveng'd! Duke. You would have justice! Balthazar. I will! Duke. Then forthwith meet me at the Duke's! Balthazar. What pledge have I for your appearance there? Duke. Your daughter, sir.âNay, go, my Juliana! 'T is my request: within an hour at farthest, I shall expect to see you at the palace. Balthazar. Come, Juliana.âYou shall find me there, sir. Duke. Look not thus sad at parting, Juliana: All will run smooth yet. Balthazar. Come! Juliana. Heav'n grant it may! Duke. The Duke shall right us all, without delay. [Exeunt different ways. SCENE II. âA Wood. Enter Volante, and several of the Count's Servants masqued. Volante. That 's he, stealing down the pathway yonder. Put on your vizorsâand remember, not a word! (They retire, and enter Rolando.) Now I shall be even with your hemp-beating. [Exit Volante. Rolando. Here am I come to be a woman's toy, And, spite of sober reason, play the fool.â 'T is a most grievous thing that a man's blood Will ever thwart his noble resolution, And make him deaf to other argument Than the quick beating of his pulse. (They come forward and surround him.) Hey-day! Why, what are these? If it be no offence, May I enquire your business? (They hold a pistol to each side of his head.) Now I can guess it. Pray reserve your fire!â (They proceed to bind him.) What can this mean?âMute, gentlemenâall mute? Pray were ye born of women?âStill ye are mute! Why, then, perhaps you mean to strangle me. (They bind him to a tree and go off.) How! gone? Why what the devil can this mean? It is the oddest end to an amour!â Enter Volante, and other Women. Volante. This is the gentleman we 're looking for. Rolando. Looking for me? You are mistaken, ladies: What can you want with such a man as I am? I am poor, ladies, miserably poor;â I am old too, though I look young; quite old, The ruins of a man. Nay, come not near me! I have the plague! my breath is venomous! My touch will, like a witch, breed ugliness! For the next fifteen generations, ladies, You will be all as mute as unbeat drums! Volante. Fear not; we'll rather be beat than be silent. Rolando. Stand off, I say! Volante. Nay, he can't scratch. Rolando. Nay, but I'll bite!â I would for you I were a porcupine, And every quill a death! Volante. By my faith, he rails valiantly, and has a valiant sword too, if he could draw it! Was ever poor gentleman so near a rope without being able to hang himself! Rolando. I could bear being bound in every limb, So ye were tongue-ty'd. That I could cast out devils to torment you!â Though ye would be a match for a whole legion. Volante. Come, come. Rolando. Nay, ladies, have some mercy: drive me not To desperation:âthough like a bear I'm fixt to the stake, and must endure the baiting, I pray ye, draw a conjurer's circle round me, And keep without it. Volante. Well, sir, we'll oblige you. (They make a circle, and dance round him.) Rolando. Untie me, ladies, and let me make one! Volante. Nay, we dare not trust you. (They continue to dance. Rolando, after repeated struggles, disengages his right arm, with which he draws his sword, and cuts the ropes that bind him.) Volante. The bear is breaking his chain. 'T is time to run, then. (The women run off; he extricates himself, and comes forward.) Rolando solus. Rolando. So, they are gone! What a damnable condition I am in! The devils that worried St. Anthony were a tame set to these! My blood boils! By all that 's mischievous, I'll carbonado the first woman I meet! If I do not, whyâI'll marry her. âHere's one already! Enter Zamora veiled. Zamora. I've kept my word, sir. Rolando. So much the worse! for I must keep my oath.â Are you prepar'd to die? Zamora. Not by your hand.â I hardly think, when you have seen my face, You'll be my executioner. Rolando. Thy face! What, you are handsome?âDon't depend on that. Had you a skin like old and musty parchment, A labyrinth of wrinkles, where a man Might study mathematicks; eyes of lead, Set like two bullets in a target; teeth Like broken bottles on an old dead wall, Serving, like them, to keep off trespassers; And fewer hair son thy deserted head Than straggle on thy chinâthere were a hope!â But if those rosy fingers, like Aurora's Lifting the veil from day, should usher forth Twin sparkling stars, to light men to their ruin; Balm-breathing lips, to seal destruction on; An alabaster forehead, hung with locks That glitter like Hyperion's; and a cheek Where the live crimson steals upon the white;â You have no hope of mercy! Zam. (unveiling.) Now, then, strike! Rolando. Eugenio? Zamora. Your poor boy, sir! Rolando. How, a woman? A real woman! What a dull ass have I been!âNay, 't is so! Zamora. You see the sister of that scornful lady Who with such fix'd disdain refus'd your love, Which, like an arrow failing of its aim, Glancing from her impenetrable heart, Struck deep in mine: in a romantic hour, Unknown to all, I left my father's house, And follow'd you to the wars.âWhat has since happen'd It better may become you to remember Than me to utter. Rolando. I am caught at last! Caught by a woman, excellently caught, Hamper'd beyond redemption!âWhy, thou witch! That in a brace of minutes hast produc'd A greater revolution in my soul Than thy whole sex could compass! thou enchantress, Prepare!âfor I must kill thee certainly!â (Throws away his sword.) But it shall be with kindness.âMy poor boy! (They embrace.) I'll marry thee to-night:âYet have a care!â For I shall love thee most unmercifully. Zamora. And as a wife should you grow weary of me, I'll be your page again. Rolando. We'll to your father! Zamora. Alas! I fear I have offended him Beyond the reach of pardon. Rolando. Think not so! In the full flood of joy at your return He'll drown his anger, and absolving tears Shall warmly welcome his poor wanderer home. What will they say to me?âWhy, they may say, And truly, that I made a silly vow, But was not quite so foolish as to keep it. [Exeunt. SCENE III. âThe Duke's Palace. Enter Balthazar and his Daughter, the Count and Volante, followed by a Servant. Balthazar. You'll tell his highness, I am waiting for him. Servant. What name, sir? Balthazar. No matter, tell him an old man, Who has been basely plunder'd of his child, And has perform'd a weary pilgrimage In search of justice, hopes to find it here. Servant. I will deliver this. [Exit Servant. Balthazar. And he shall right me; Or I will make his dukedom ring so loud With my great wrongs, thatâ Juliana. Pray be patient, sir. Balthazar. Where is your husband? Juliana. He will come, no doubt. Count. I'll pawn my life for his appearance, quickly! Enter Servant. Balthazar. What news, sir? Servant. The Duke will see you presently. Balthazar. 'T is well! Has there been here a man to seek him lately? Servant. None, sir. Balthazar. A tall well-looking man enough, Tho' a rank knave, dress'd in a peasant's garb? Servant. There has been no such person. Balthazar. No, nor will be! It was a trick to steal off safely, And get the start of justice. He has reach'd, Ere this, the nearest seaport, or inhabits One of his air-built castles. Servant. Stand aside! The Duke enters, superbly dressed, with Jaquez and a train of Attendants. Duke. Now, sir, your business with me? Balthazar. How? Juliana. Amazement! Duke. I hear you would have audience? Jaquez. Exactly my manner! Balthazar. Of the Duke, sir. Duke. I am the Duke. Balthazar. The jest is somewhat stale! Duke. You'll find it true. Balthazar. Indeed! Jaquez. Nobody doubted my authority. Juliana. Be still, my heart! (Aside.) Balthazar. I think you would not trifle with me now?â Duke. I am the Duke Aranza.â Count. 'T is e'en so. (To Balthazar.) Duke. And, what 's my greater pride, this lady's husband; Whom, having honestly redeem'd my pledge, I thus take back again. You now must see The drift of what I have been lately acting, And what I am. And though, being a woman Giddy with youth and unrestrained fancy, The domineering spirit of her sex I have rebuk'd too sharply; yet 't was done, As skilful surgeons cut beyond the wound, To make the cure complete. Balthazar. You have done most wisely, And all my anger dies in speechless wonder. Jaquez. So does all my greatness! Duke. What says my Juliana? Juliana. I am lost, too, In admiration, sir: my fearful thoughts Rise on a trembling wing to that rash height, Whence, growing dizzy once, I fell to earth. Yet since your goodness, for the second time, Will lift me, tho' unworthy, to that pitch Of greatness, there to hold a constant flight, I will endeavour so to bear myself, That in the world's eye, and my friends' observanceâ And, what's far dearer, your most precious judgmentâ I may not shame your dukedom. Duke. Bravely spoken! Why, now you shall have rank and equipageâ Servants, for you can now command yourselfâ Glorious apparel, not to swell your pride, But to give lustre to your modesty. All pleasures, all delights, that noble dames Warm their chaste fancies with, in full abundance Shall flow upon you; and it shall go hard But you shall ride the Barbary courser too.â Count, you have kept my secret, and I thank you. Count. Your grace has reason; for in keeping that I well nigh lost my mistress. On your promise I now may claim her, sir. (To Balthazar.) Balthazar. What says my girl? Volante. Well, since my time is come, sirâ Balthazar. Take her then. (Joins their hands.) Duke. But who comes yonder? Count. 'Sdeath! why, 't is Rolando. Duke. But that there hangs a woman on his arm, I'd swear 't was he! Volante. Nay, 't is the gentleman. Duke. Then have the poles met! Volante. Oh, no, only two of the planets have jostled each other. Venus has had too much attraction for Mars. Enter Rolando, with Zamora veiled. Count. Why, Captain! Duke. Signor Rolando! Rol. (After they have laugh'd some time.) Nay, 't is a woman! And one that has a soul too, I'll be bound for 't. Volante. He must be condemn'd to her for some offence, as a truant horse is tied to a log, or a great school-boy carries his own rod to the place of execution. Rolando. Laugh till your lungs crack, 't is a woman still. Count. I'll not believe it till I see her face. Volante. It is some boy dress'd up to cozen us. Rolando. It was a boy, dress'd up to cozen me! Suffice it, sirs, that being well convinc'dâ In what I lately was, a stubborn scepticâ That women may be reasonable creatures; And finding that your grace, in one fair instance, Has wrought a wond'rous reformation in them; I am resolv'd to marry (they all laugh)âfor 't is odds (Our joint endeavours lab'ring to that end) That in another century or two They may become endurable. What say you? (To the Duke.) Have I your free consent? Duke. Most certainly. Rolando. Yours, sir? (To the Count.) Count. Most readily. Rolando. And yours? (To Balthazar.) Balthazar. Most heartily. Jaquez. He does not ask mine! Rolando. Add but your blessing, sir, and we are happy! What think you of my page!â (Zamora unveils, and kneels to Balthazar.) Volante. How! Balthazar. Zamora! Zamora. Your daughter, sir; who, trembling at your feetâ Balthazar. Come to my heart!â You knew how deeply you were rooted there, Or scarce had ventur'd such a frolick. Zamora. That, sir, Should have prevented me! Balthazar. There; she is yours, sir, If you are still determined. Rolando. Fixt as fate. Nor in so doing do I change my mind; I swore to wed no womanâshe's an angel. Volante. Ay, so are all women before marriage; and that 's the reason their husbands so soon wish them in heaven afterwards. Duke. Those who are tartly tongued: but our example This truth shall manifestâA gentle wife Is still the sterling comfort of man's life; To fools a torment, but a lasting boon To those whoâwisely keep their honey moon. [Exeunt omnes FINIS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Miss Decamp. Well!ânow two weighty points at length are carriedâ My sister tam'd, poor soul! and I, well married:â A task more difficult awaits us stillâ We wantâbut do we merit?âyour good-will. What say you, criticks? I your care bespeak For our young honey moon, in her first week. Her principle is bland attraction's lawsâ Her primum mobile is your applause. May no moon-gazing critic here apply To fault-exaggerating glass his eye, And multiply one wrinkle into twenty! All moons have spotsâand ours, no doubt, has plenty. What a strange contrast!âWhile, in merry strife, We here have taught the men to rule a wife, At no great distance is a diff'rent schoolâ Which teaches wives their husbands how to rule: And I must say, though in our bard's despite, The other author is the most polite. But since the men were so indulgent thereâ They to that author turn'd a fav'ring earâ We hope our sex will follow their example, And here, of candour shew as full a sample. Ladies, forgive our author's saucy pen; And don't in kindness be outdone by men. All must approve the name he gave his play;â Against a honey moon who aught can say? Some here the sweet ordeal must have pass'd; And others hope their turn will come at last. So all for honey moons must have affection, From expectation; or, from recollection. May then each bright spectatress of to-night, Prove, to our infant moon, a satellite! Smile on her, ladies, for her sex's sake (Poets, you know, the moon a female make): No charm can save our Cynthia from eclipse, Like the soft witchcraft of a lady's lips.â I might indulge in further illustrations; But here I'll end my lunar observations.</field>
