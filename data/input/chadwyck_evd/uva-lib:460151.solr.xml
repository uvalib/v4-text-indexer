      <field name="fulltext">THE SULTAN: OR, LOVE AND FAME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Almira sola. What Passion more, distracts the human breast, Or sooner breaks humanity's soft ties, Than thouâoh peace-destroying jealousy?â Heart racking torments fill thy dark domain, The cheerless cavern of unequal'd woe, Relentless tyrant of the jaundic'd mind, Thy slave am Iâno more my former selfâ No more the credulous and doating fool: All innate softness of my gentle sex, Tender remorse, and pity's cherub smiles, Are chang'd to adamant by jealous rage. Enter Fatima. Fat. Frown not, my royal mistress, at the zeal Which boldly thus presumes on privacy: But duty, urging gratitude, demands I should partake, and strive to balm the care, Which clouds so heavily your godlike brow. Alm. How few, my Fatima, like thee will strive Through the rough storm of dark adversity Kindly to guide the tempest-shaken wretch: Myriads of insects wait the summer's sun, Sporting amidst the lustre of his beams, Which shrink, and vanish from a wintry blast. Fat. Disgraceful emblem of a faithless world. Alm. Time has not flutter'd long his restless wings, Since I appear'd this awful empire's pride; A sparkling star in splendor's brightest sphere: Now view me circled in a dark eclipse Of those resplendent honours I enjoy'd, Cast by this fickle emperor aside, And almost sunk to Aphendina's slave. Fat. Oh most inglorious, most ungrateful change! As much to reason opposite, as love. Almira was not born to fortune's shade: Th'imperial greatness of her tow'ring mind Mounts her above adversity's dull wing, And beams around in native lustre bright. Alm. And shall I therefore bear insulted love? Tamely submit to see the faithless Osman Lay all his honours at my rival's feet; Nor deign perhaps to cast a glance on me, Unless from eyes of chill indifference? Noârather rouse my indignation up, And let me stifle all my heart-felt wrongs I own my jealousyâavow my shameâ But holdâshall hated Aphendina see The painful workings of my tortur'd heart; Smile at my pangs, and triumph in my fall?â Noâlet me smother up my swelling wrongs, Till opportunity gives glorious means To thunder vengeance on the tyrant's head. Fat. I fear you meditate some dreadful scene, In which the hand of unrelenting fate May reach your sacred life. Alm. Suppose it should; The grave; how welcome to a wretch like me! From all my woes, how blest that still retreat! But vengeance furnishes a fairer view: Solan, a leading pillar of the state, Whom I have long retain'd in am'rous bonds, Yields, tho' reluctant, to my deep designs. His weakness shall invigorate my cause, And pregnant time some other aid may yield, To shake this tow'ring pyramid of fame, This false, this cruelâbut, too lovely Osman. Fat. Our holy prophet smile upon your cause; And shielding with protection's kindest wing, Preserve you from the perils which surround. Alm. I thank thy zealâbut see the prince appearsâ Good Fatima, my faithful friend, retire. [Exit Fatima. Enter Solan. Sol. Hail, royal fair, by whose all-piercing eyes The god of love gains universal sway: When I would pay due tribute to such charms, Expression fails to speak my raptur'd heart, And silent wonder binds the pow'rs of speech. Alm. Illustrious prince, altho' thy gen'rous love Might gratify the scope of female pride; Yet higher matters claim attention now, Than such soft feelings of impassion'd hearts: This tyrant Osmanâ Sol. Madam, the conqu'ror comes, With all the glorious pageantry of war; With laurell'd victory, with boundless fame, And the mild glory of a sued-for peace. His eager people fill in gazing crouds (From doating age to prattling infancy) Each avenue, and undulate the skies With thund'ring shouts of ardent loyalty. While heâ Alm. I charge thee on thy love to cease, Nor wound me with their sycophantic joy, Which comes like poison'd daggers to my heart. Sol. Why should the breath of popular applause, Inconstant offspring of capricious minds, Give you a moment's pain? Perhaps, the route, Which now so madly idolize his name, May, ere one transient moon shall fill its orb, With faction's ranc'rous voice arraign his sway: Such are the strange vicissitudes of pow'r. Alm. Welcome the time, when dark adversity Shall veil his hateful glories from my sight: Soon may the arm of fate unfix his crown, Then hurl him headlong from th'imperial seat, And fix thee more-deserving in his place. Sol. What says Almira?âthe imperial throne! To bend a thought, or cast an eye that way, Must sully honour, and diminish fame. Alm. Honour's a dazzling meteor of the soul, Which leads its timid proselytes astray. Should they be us'd with honour who have none? Should faith be kept with him who breaks all vows? Thou think'st he is thy friendâI once too thought Almira kept possession of his heart; But sad experience shews the base deceit: 'Tis vain to hope for cordial friendship there, Where sacred love's soft ties are thus profan'd. Sol. Thy injur'd heart, fair Sultaness, enrag'd, Permits not reason to foresee events Which fill the womb of dark conspiracy, That hydra headed minister of fate, The bane of public quiet and repose: A monarch is not single in his fall, But, falling, draws a heap of win round him. More than his foes may wish or can prevent. No friend to human nature, or the state, Would madly raise so perilous a storm, When just disdain may blunt the edge of wrongs. Alm. Oh, fit philosophy for passive minds; Shame to my heart, and to my cause disgrace; Fortune, if try'd, will crown us with success: If Solan yields to principles so weak, I must retract the heart I lately gave: For know, Almira cannot deign her love To him, who will not gratify revenge, And place her, when he may, upon a throne: But haply danger will outweigh thy love; If so, from other hands I'll seek redress. Sol. Think'st thou that danger in most frightful forms, That ever trembling cowardice conceiv'd, Could check that heart which makes thy love its prize? By all the joys of paradise, I swear, To hold thee mine, or perish in th'attempt! Yet still, to wrong the man I think my friend, And leap the bounds which gratitude prescribes, Is a reflection shocks my honest soul. Alm. Still, still thy friend, when prov'd Almira's foe: Love, when sincere, by sympathy alarm'd, Catches the smiles of joy, or tears of grief; But now I find th'influence of those charms, On which you've lavish'd such a world of praise: Find too 'tis time to shun fresh cause of woe, And banish thee for ever from my thoughts. Sol. Yet hold, my fairâreverse this sad decree, Pregnant with ev'ry pain which nature knows; And by our Prophet's rev'rend shrine, I vow To gain the treasure of Almira's love; My flutt'ring heart is ready to obey: Speak then at large, bright guardian of my soul, What deeds important Solan must perform; Love shall direct him; love shall be his guide; And fair Almira shine his leading star. Alm. Oh, now the hero; now the lover speaks; And claims the kindest wishes, in return, That sensibility of heart can give. [Flourish of martial music. But hark, the conqu'ror comesâhence, like those sprites Which shun the eye of dayâlet us retire; And in the shades of privacy indulge Those gloomy transports, which from vengeance spring. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter Osman, Effendi, Omar, Orasmin, Mirvan, Alibec, and Rustan, in triumph; with a procession of Tartars, Bostangis, Janissaries, Polish hostages, officers of the Seraglio, Dervises, Banner of Mahomet, of war, and of the empire, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Osm. Subjects, the toils of war are now no more; All-cheering peace again displays her smiles, (Like summer-suns succeeding wintry skies,) And spreads around an universal joy: Our arms have taught the Christians to revere, And bow before the sons of holy Mahomet: We spoke in thunder, and made all obey; Since then, the fury of the tempest's o'er, And softer passions take their turn to reign; Let all our shrill ton'd instruments of war, Which have so oft breath'd terror to the foe, Be soften'd to the melody of love: For lo, she comesâthe sum of ev'ry wishâ The source of joyâmy Aphendina comesâ [Symphony of soft music. Enter Aphendina, Elisana, &amp;c. preceded by the Kisler Aga, twelve black eunuchs, and officers of the Seraglio; followed by six Odalisks. Osm. Rise, Aphendina, to my eager arms, And let me clasp thee in the folds of love; Press thy soft bosom to my panting heart, Which bounds to meet the mistress of its joys. Aph. Oh, may these eyes ne'er know less perfect bliss; To see my Osman happily return'd Triumphant from the sanguine field of war, Makes kind atonement for those lonely hours, Those tedious days; those melancholy nights; The train of wand'ring thoughts, and phantom fears, Which in thy absence banish'd my repose. Osm. What is fame's trumpet, and its thund'ring voice, To the soft murmurs of thy gentle love? Now by our prophet, tho' she sounds my name, And with it terrifies the Christian world; 'Tis love alone yields absolute content: To hold thee thus; to gaze upon thy charms, Is the supremest bliss the world can give: Each time I view thee, I am more thy slave. Each coming day new captivates my soul, And gives me still an higher sense of joy. Aph. How poor is gratitude in such extremes, To speak a heart so sensible as mine? Chusing me out the partner of your throne; Nay more, the honour'd partner of your heart, Claims more than all acknowledgement can pay. Osm. I prithee, peaceâthy love o'erpays it allâ What were the empire of the world to me, If thou, my Aphendina did'st not share? Before my prattling infancy was o'er, 'Twas joy to lisp, and dwell upon thy name; While, good Effendi, with paternal care, Prepar'd me for the honours I enjoy; His sage advice to glory form'd my soul; But thy soft charms dissolv'd my heart to love. Aph. 'Twas then too Aphendina felt the flame, The lambent flame first play around her heart; Held bound in chains before I knew the cause: A bless'd captivity; I would not change For all the joys which liberty can boast. Osm. Thou art my spotless paradise on earth, Untouch'd with discord, or perplexing care: Whene'er thou speak'st, my bosom is inspir'd With soft sensations of extremest blissâ Let us retire, my love, from public view, Which but prophanes, and interrupts our joy. [Going, Omar kneels. Om. Most mighty Osman; our imperial lord; Illustrious monarch; eldest born of Fame; If bending thus, thy slave may dare to speakâ Osm. Rise, Omar, thou hast well deserv'd our grace; Thy services have been of such extent, Their want of recompence would brand my name How poor are monarchs, eminently great, If virtue marks them not supremely good. Om. It is too much, my emperor, too much; My humble deeds could ne'er deserve such praise, Tho' conscious rectitude has been my guide; A kind acceptance of that honest zeal, Which ne'er could reach the wishes of my heart, Were ample recompence for life itself; Nor could my hopes beyond that mark aspire, Unless sustain'd by your august command. Osm. I do remember me, I bade thee speak, And mind me of the promise which I gave, To fix thee vizier; I appoint thee so; And order thee possession of the seals. Om. The smiles of gracious heav'n propitious fall, And fit me for such delegated pow'r: May our great prophet bless my bounteous lord, And, ever watchful, shield his sacred throne; Still crown with victory, in all his wars, And bless his peaceful hours with perfect joy. Osm. I feel the pious tribute of thy heart, Fair offspring of thy loyalty and love: When thou would'st have me fully blest indeed, Invoke our prophet with thy fervent pray'rs, To keep, preserve, fair Aphendina mine; In her life, empire, nay, my all consists; Guard her from fate, and Osman must be safe. [All go off but Orasmin and Alibec. Intermingled flourishes of martial and soft music. Manent Orasmin, and Alibec. Oras. Why have I liv'd to be this outcast slave? Why 'scap'd with life from peril pregnant war, To groan beneath indignities so vile? To see those honours which my blood has earn'd, Giv'n, in my presence, to a mortal foe? Alib. Omar, I guess, your meaning points Oras. The same, my friend; He still has been a check upon my rise, An evil genius to my tow'ring hopes; And yet, my heart, tho' stung with fresh disgrace, In vain may wish, and struggle to be free; Each moment gives more fuel to my rage; Remembrance laden with new torment comes, And ev'ry thought's a dagger in my breast. Alib. Orasmin, famous, and renown'd in war, Unshaken pillar of the Turkish throne; On conquests gain'd, I could with pleasure hail; (Since, well I know, the glory which is won, We to thy valour and thy conduct owe:) But, when I see such merits cast aside, View Osman, blind to thy unbounded worth, I own, it touches me with near concern, As tho' my person felt the base affront. Oras. Warrior of fame, thy sympathetic heart Still mourns for merit, gloomed with cold neglect: Thou, who hast known my services, can tell How much this Osman to Orasmin owes; This pageant emperor, this shallow prince; Who sees not where his strength of empire lies. Alib. May ev'ry curse ingratitude should feel Fall on him here, and brand his future fame. Oras. I, who have so much labour'd in his cause, And, at life's hazard, sought for his renown; Gather'd him fame in conquest's bloodiest fields, Grafted a grove of laurels on his brows, And forc'd ev'n kings to bow before his throne; Am cast aside with most indignant scorn: And all (for other cause there can be none,) Because my tongue's a stranger to deceit. Alib. Trust me, illustrious Aga, I lament, That partial favor can so much prevail 'Gainst loyalty and services like thine. But ev'ry age and clime give ample proofs, That most untainted merit slowest thrives. Oras. And think'st thou, friend, beneath such rank abuse, That patience turning prostitute to wrongs Should check the swellings of an injur'd heart? No; my proud soul disdains to think of peace, And vengeance only can restore content. Alib. A refuge full of danger, as of doubt; Knows not Orasmin that this Osman rests On the firm pillar of his people's love; Therefore, forbear to give your passion scope; Try to restrain the torrent of your rage, And scorn those injuries you can't revenge. Oras. No more, good Alibec, thou plead'st in vain, Tho' ev'ry word were spoke with wisdom's voice; As well thou might'st compose a madman's rage, By telling that which gave his madness birth; Or calm the billows of an angry sea With a rough tempest sweeping from the north. Th'Archipelago by right was mine; Adrianople too, I sought in vain: And now a dastard wins the vizier's place. I would forget th'injurious wrongs I feel, But wounded honour cries aloud, revenge; And even that, that refuge from despair, Tyrannic fate deniesâwhat then remains? Yesâstab my foolish heart, which beats so high, To build the fame of this ungrateful prince. Alib. What means Orasmin, death? Oras. Yes, death, my friend: Thou would'st not have me live this Omar's scorn, Nor set me up the jest of paltry knaves, Who laugh, when patient merit is oppress'd. Alib. Let all such perish ere Orasmin falls; Methinks I spy a gleam of distant hope Break thro' the sable cloud of circ'ling care. Oras. Oh, say from whence can cheering comfort spring, To balm the anguish of my tortur'd mind; Give the blest prospect, while my list'ning soul Hangs on the counsel of thy friendly heart. Alib. Thou know'st Almira, late Sultana Queen, Has oft been heard to murmur at her wrongs; And love forsaken turns to bitter rage: No instrument more fit than female hate To wing destruction with resistless force. I dare avow, she'll gladly join her friends, Her means, her cause, her jealousy to yours. Oras. By heav'n, kind Alibec, thy words inspire, And fill my bosom with a glowing flame, That animates, and lights me to revenge: Revenge! the fever of an injur'd mind, Which owns no healthful remedy but blood. Alib. Then, let it stream. Oras. It shall, my valiant friend: But know, I wish to prove my fate at once; I hate the frosty chilness of delay, By which oft fairest enterprizes fail: Therefore, do thou to the Sultana haste, And sound the secret purpose of her mind: Let thy tongue pour smooth venom to her ear, And quench all sparks of fondness which remain: If her thoughts bend towards the point I wish, Then, speak me zealous to espouse her cause. Alib. Doubt not in this, my policy or zeal: I'll set such Engines speedily at work, As must, I hope, give tidings of success. Oras. In the dark grove behind Sophia's mosque, When the sun beams from his meridian height, I'll wait thee, as the panting bridegroom does The near approach of pow'rful nuptial joys; Then haste, good friend, with speed my fate explore, And bring me hopes, that comfort may be found; Or, let despair send forth contagious breath, And sweep Orasmin to the vale of death. [Exeunt severally. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Osman and Effendi. Osman. Effendi, I must tell thee once again, That in this point my honour is concern'd; And think'st thou that shall tamely brook a wrong? Effen. Avert it, heav'n! resembling new-fall'n snow, A monarch's honour should be free from stain. Osm. Thy precepts taught me, in my younger years, To keep uncurb'd with dignity my rule; Wisely remarking, that imperial pow'r Should guide with steady hands a restive state. Those traitors have deserv'd, and rous'd our rage; Reduction is a punishment too small, Where life for disobedience should atone. Effen. I own, great Sir, that your august resolves Should hold disposal of offending lives: Yet temper'd justice is the wisest rule, That braces lenity too far relax'd, And checks the perilous excess of pow'r. Reflect a little on the mighty force In this collected band you would dissolve: The Janissaries, Sir, have ever been Mark'd thro' all ages for seditious sons, Prepar'd to spread destruction thro' the land. Osm. By Mahomet, I blush to hear thee speak: Is it Effendi paints these shadowy fears? What tremor of the mind has seiz'd thee, thus To plead so warmly in their tainted cause, Who well deserve to feel our utmost wrath. Effen. Reason, not int'rest, urges what I plead; As such, illustrious prince, admit my words. Osm. Is it not plain, but for their coward hearts, Or, what is worse, their factious stubborn minds, Which stood in opposition to my will, Ere this I had subdu'd the Polish king, And trod the barb'rous Muscovite to earth. When passing to the confines of the sea, I might have sent such pow'rful navies forth, As would have spread my conquests o'er the main, And made e'en Britain strike her flag to mine; Whilst I at land had laurell'd millions led, To sure subjection of the Christian world. But cross'd, oppos'd, by this rebellious crew, Perplex'd with mutinies and endless jars, I was oblig'd ingloriously to stop, And stain my honour with imperfect peace. Effen. My sov'reign lord, you've gain'd immortal fame, Enough of glory lights your awful brows, Rich in the temp'rate lustre of its rays. Did not the Christians humbly sue for peace? To nought but mercy did great Osman yield. Osm. Now, by our prophet, 'twas most infamous; An Act without the shadow of excuse. Was it not base, with fortune at our nod, With holy Mahomet to lead us on, To make the glorious, dreadful pomp of war No better than an empty pageant show? Awhile like threat'ning storms to gloom around, And then like vapours to dissolve away? What deathless honour had we full in view, If in our proud success, by force of arms, The Koran's influence had spread around, And taught those Christians to obey its laws: Our prophet then in Paradise had smil'd, To see a world converted by his sons. Effen. How do I honour this religious zeal, Celestial offspring of a virtuous mind! How deeply grieve that factious malecontents Had pow'r to stop so laudable a view. But who can check a torrent's rapid force, Or stay the lightning's instantaneous beams? Who, but that Pow'r, invisibly immense! By whose direction his creation moves. Heav'n kindly teaches to preserve ourselves, While reason, friendly monitor, exclaims, 'Twere madness to enflame seditious rage. Osm. And for that cause, thou know'st, I gave it way, Till e'en tame prudence should cry out revenge. But shall I now let disobedience live; Let daring insolence confront my throne? No: I'm resolv'd to sacrifice the slaves, In retribution for diminish'd fame. Effen. Since fate resistless waits upon the act, Once more I beg my sov'reign may reflect, Nor rashly hazard his most sacred life. Osm. Is fear of death to fetter regal sway? Were hov'ring fate to frown upon the deed, By Mecca's sacred temple here I vow, This knot of disobedience I'd dissolve. Effen. Let me presume then, royal Sir, to say, This rashness springs from inconsid'rate youth: Youth, more by passion than by reason led; Youth, which with flowing reins drives madly on, O'erleaping bounds experience would prescribe. Osm. Ha!âby our prophet, thou art much to blame: Wert thou not father to my gentle love, Presuming thus to contradict my will, Is what I could not easily forgive. Enter Aphendina. Aph. My father!âwhy this care upon thy brow? Why wears my lord a discontented frown? If griefs assail, I claim a right to share, And will not yield the privilege of love. Osm. My Aphendina, while possess'd of thee, No care can long lie heavy at my heart: Thy tender looks can calm my raging soul, And lull its wildest transports into peace. Aph. Still I must doubt a subject of concern, Which gives my father fix'd and downcast eyes: If Aphendina truly shares thy love, Oh speak, my Osman; let her know the cause; For pain'd suspense sits trembling at her heart. Osm. Let not vain phantasy alarm thy mind, Nor settle care within thy dove-like breast: Business of state had ruffled bustling thought, And the same cause knit up thy father's brows. Now all is well again: as clouds give way Before the beams of the all-chearing sun, Care's dusky gloom obeys thy matchless smiles, Unable to withstand those radiant eyes. Effen. When duty warms to speech an honest heart, Why should the subject tongue deny its aid? Hear then, my daughter; hear thy father speak: Th'affection which I owe my prince and you, Nay more, the impulse of a patriot heart, Warm for its country's good, and all mankind, Demands I should prevent approaching storms, Which hov'ring round, portend a gen'ral wreck. Osm. No more, Effendi; on thy love, no more: I'm satisfy'd of thy parental zeal For me, my Aphendina, and the state; By which I charge thee urge this theme no more. [Exit Effendi. Aph. Oh cruel Osman!âam I then become Unfit to know the secrets of thy breast? If so, no longer let me share thy throne; Let me be cast an exile from thy breast: Love a divided int'rest never knew. Could I have thoughts I would secrete from thee? Who can be more deserving thy repose, Than her whose life depends upon thy love? Osm. I beg thee press me on this point no more: Thou art unquestion'd mistress of my heart; My life, my honour, are at thy command: But sure it could not seem a proof of love, To wound thee with unnecessary fears: That were self-torture; I should feel the pain, And all thy woes would be redoubled here. Aph. Can Osman then admit a cause of fear, Yet make that cause a stranger to my breast? By ev'ry tender tie which nature feels, By the strong impulse of connubial love, Let me conjure thee with a candid mind To say what dangers o'er the state impend, For some were pictur'd in my father's eyes: And he, grown cold with philosophic age, Changes not features upon slight events, Nor apprehension draws from sportive chance. Give then the pow'rful motives to my view, Nor turn away to shun my pious suit. Must these sad eyes dissolve with tears in vain? If I have yet an int'rest in thy heart; If fondness lives not in external show; Dispel suspense, and banish anxious fears, For mischief still is magnify'd by doubt. Osm. Rise, Aphendina, thou must still prevail; By thee impress'd my heart takes any form: Therefore I'll tell theeâbut some other timeâ This present now I beg thou wilt excuse: I would not call the subject back again, Lest it should kindle me to painful rage. But, to relieve thy tender heart from care, By our great prophet's holy tomb I vow, My Aphendina shall partake in all. No longer then let air-bred Fancies pain, Nor discontent within thy bosom heave; In ev'ry scene thou shalt have equal part, And share in empire, as thou shar'st my heart. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Orasmin meeting Alibec. Oras. What comfort, friend? Alib. As much as we could wish Almira's heart, by jealousy inspir'd, Rejoicing, glories in thy promis'd aid. Nay, fortune grants us higher favours still; Solan, the Georgian princeâthe fav'rite too. Whom the sultana's beauty holds enslav'd, Devotes his influence to assist her cause. Oras. Say'st thou, my friend? why such intelligence Would rouse to vig'rous action palsied age: Like a fierce tempest sweeping o'er the main, Sedition's rapid tide of whelming waves Will dash this Osman on the rock of fate. So shall the glories of this earthly sun, Hurl'd by our force from his emblazon'd sphere, Set in the gulph of everlasting night. Alib. Behold, the prince appearsâhe moves this way, With business glowing on his eager brow. He comes perhapsâ Oras. Haste thou good Alibec; Zama and Rustan find with speedy care. I know their bosoms rankle deep with wrongs; And they have partizans of high import. Hither conduct them with thy utmost speed. Alib. If a warm heart to diligence gives wings, Doubt not my case. [Exit Alibec. Enter Solan. Sol. Renown'd Orasmin, hail! Oras. Hail, gallant prince! Sol. By me Almira speaks, And greets thee, noble Aga, as her friend. Oras. I find, I feel full honour in that name, And bend in gratitude to her ambassador. Whose worth gives higher dignity than crowns. Sol. Such praise weighs merit downâhear you the Report That Osman means to break the Janissaries, For disobedience, in the Polish war. Oras. I heard it not, but now rejoice to hear; I know it gall'd his pride, that we refus'd Longer to wage unprofitable war. In camp, one day, he breath'd his threats aloud, At which a murmur ran thro' ev'ry rank, Sullen as that of a retiring tide: Should he again revive the frantic scheme, 'Twill be a well-aim'd thunder-bolt of fate, To rank him with the subjects of the grave. Sol. In this he meets the wishes of his foes; The martial band, no doubt, inform'd of this, Like a sprung mine, will burst with ruin round, And in your cause appear resistless friends. Oras. An oracle of truth! they will be friends indeed, When dear self-int'rest sets on foot their rage; Thou may'st observe it, Solan, thro' the world, That int'rest bears an universal sway; The souls of men, in general, center there; Some fight for int'rest, some for int'rest pray; And, were not honesty the road to want, It would not be that slighted thing it is. Sol. How will the vaunting warrior then appear, Divested of the honours he enjoys; When, like a fabric, shatter'd from its base, He falls a prostrate ruin on the earth? Oras. Almira's triumph then will be compleat; Her galling taunts more deeply wound his pride Than all the attributes of empire lostâ Or I mistake, or Zama comes this way, With Alibec and Rustanâit would be well To let them know this emperor's design. Sol. That task be mine; stand thou, as a reserve To speak at large, upon the hints I give. Enter Alibec, Rustan, and Zama. Sol. Hail, gallant friends. Zam. Intrepid Solan, hail. Sol. Has the report which wings itself abroad, Which bears no less of wonder than of truth As yet assail'd your ears? Rust. Of what import, brave prince? Sol. Total reduction of the Janissaries. Zam. Bears it the stamp of truth? Sol. I fear too sure; Methinks, I would not have that warlike band, Who still have labour'd in their country's cause, With deeds heroic, and unbating zeal, So cast aside upon surmis'd offence. Rust. Neglected worth must seek its own reward; Osman may find, in spite of all his pow'r, We are not to be cast aside with ease. Zam. Shame to our honour, should we tamely yield To meagre poverty, and foul disgrace. Rust. Must services like ours be so repaid? Have we for this bestow'd our blood in streams? Oras. Fellows in war, and partners of my fame, Whose emulative souls in glory's chace Have oft outstretch'd the wings of swift applause; Shall we, to whom this Osman owes his crown, From whose unequal'd fortitude in arms He draws the glory which adorns his reign, As useless now, be branded with disgrace? Alib. Ere that, let nature into ruin sink, And all distinction vanish in her wreck. Oras. Shall he, for whom we've march'd o'er trackless wastes, Opposing constancy to famine's pangs, To fainting nature, and to dire disease, With the pale train of death in countless shapes; Shall this ungrateful prince disband us now, And we not shew a spirit of revenge? Rust. I cannot read the thoughts of other men, How patience or resentment may prevail; But, for my single self, I am resolved, O'erleaping pallid caution's fearful bounds, Such base dishonour to prevent, or fall. Oras. Now by war's banner I rejoice to find A soul with sense of indignation fir'd; Which bounds with spirit from oppressive wrongs, And, scorning danger, dare assert its right. Alib. My thoughts agree in ev'ry point with yours; And may our prophet's influence diffuse, To ev'ry Mussulman, the glorious sympathy. Zam. Words I profess not in the flow of speech; To courtiers needless flourishes belong, While the rough soldier shews himself by deeds. To them let me appeal. Sol. There virtue spoke; The noble feeling of an honest heart. What gives the fairest prospect of success, Is the sultana's countenance and zeal. Nor ought but firm resolves, and mutual faith, Is wanting to secure us fortune's smilesâ Oras. Who can want that when wrongs so loudly call? By fame I would not own that man my friend, Whose dastard heart could shrink in such a cause.â But come; the time demands our utmost speed; Quick let us breathe dissention through the croud; Cast discord's seed into a thriving soil, And cultivate it with assiduous care. Sedition swift as lightning shoots along, And like a pestilential plague devours. Think, oh my friends, what an immortal Fame Will blazon deeds like ours to future times: Let this to glory warm each gallant heart, And be thou, holy Mahomet, our guide; Till full revenge atones our matchless wrongs, Or friendly death the wounds of honour heals. [Exeunt. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter Osman, and Omar. Osman. Omar, I thank thee for thy kind advice, And will adopt thy smooth pacific plan; For tho' my soul abhors to countermine, Tho' I would act in open face of day, That I may have a surety of revenge; Thy flower, sager measures I'll pursue. Om. My emperor does honour to his slave: Let it not seem th'effect of boastful pride, If I presume to say, no subject heart E'er throb'd with warmer loyalty and love. Osm. I hold thee, Omar, as my valu'd friend, Fix'd in the fairest page of my esteem; And, I am happy in thy patriot zeal. Enter Effendi. Osm. How now, Effendi!âwhy those startled eyes? They suit not that serenity of soul Thy priesthood, and thy gravity require: What is the business which can shake thee thus? Effen. Would I had never liv'd to see this day; But, that death's angel had, with friendly hand Laid in the silent tomb my hoary hairs; Those dangers, which my soul prophetic saw, Like a loud torrent thro' the city roar, And the next moment may decree our fate. Om. What mystery implies the dreadful tale, So aptly painted in thy anxious looks? Osm. Explain thyselfâI understand thee notâ Has apprehension so appall'd thy heart, As to let fancy shake thee with false fears? Effen. Oh, rather say my cause of fear is just, When rude rebellion shews its hydra head With open violence, and force of arms. The Janissaries marshall'd now appear, And fill the hippodrome with dreadful show. Osm. Say'st thou, Effendi! what demand the slaves? Effen. Anarchy's bold flights go far beyond The ken of reason's eyeâsome busy fiends Have told, with aggravation, your design; Spreading fierce flames of mutiny abroad: Hence, on the specious show of self-defence, They proudly swear, they will not be dissolv'd, Threat'ning destruction for the very thought. Osm. Are they become so resolutely bold? On their own heads then let destruction fall: By holy Mahomet, my soul's on fire, To find the sons of mutiny so brave; Thy spirit, surely, with thy age declines. Omar, with speed draw forth our faithful guards, In person I'll oppose those rebel slaves, And prove how much a monarch can prevail. Om. Let me not seem, great Sir, to damp that fire, Which dignifies true royalty of heart; Yet, suffer me to say, a step like this, However brave, must court the frowns of fate: I know them wellâimpatient of controul, And madly bold in their resistless strength; Motives less forceable would fan their rage To flame a conflagration thro' the state. Osm. Now shame upon it, should such rev'rend heads Advise to give this base sedition way? Effen. Bound to your dignity, we wish for peace, Which gentle patience now alone can give. Osm. Peace! the cold precept of unfeeling hearts: NoâI'm resolv'd, it never shall be said That Osman, sprung from mighty Ottoman, Did, with such infamy, his lineage stain. Therefore, I say again, draw forth the guards; And Solan with the Spahis he commands, Direct to wait us at the palace gate. Effen. Alas! my liege; the pow'r of speech is pain, When forc'd to be the messenger of woe; But to assail you with a painful truth, Which weeping duty would in vain conceal: Solan is rank'd amongst the factious bands. Om. Great Mahomet! can it be possible? Can our frail nature warp so much to vice, Degrading man beneath the lowest brute? Osm. How! Solan; say'st thou, in sedition's train, Then the world knows no certainty, no truth; And friendship's sunk to nothing but a name: Ingratitude more shocks a gen'rous mind Than all the terror which rebellion wears; Osman could see opposing worlds in arms, Nor shrink before the thund'ring storm of fate; But the revolt of Solan stabs so deep; Quite thro' the heart it penetrates my soul. Om. Afflicted honour shares the virtuous pain, To find him false, she thought a stedfast friend. Osm. But why should dastard care unman me thus? And strengthen rebels by ill tim'd delay; Rouse, rouse my heart, nor let unmeaning grief Check the rapidity of just revenge. Come let us forthâdeserted, as I am, I'll crush the traitors and secure my throne. [Going. Enter Aphendina. Aph. Stay, Osman, stay; 'tis Aphendina calls; The time has been when Osman would have staid, Whole happy days to cheer me with his love; But that soft season's past, he flies me now: If empire rivals and defeats my joy, Curst be its pageantry, and worthless show; 'Twere better we had humble rustics been, With simpler pleasures, and with lighter cares; Then might thy looks have better welcome borne Upon the downy pinions of content. Osm. No more, my Aphendina, chide no more; 'Tis in thy love alone I'm truly blest: But on each moment hangs thy Osman's fate; And, though thou art the source of all my joy, Prime source and beauteous herald of my joy; Much, much I wish these eyes had not beheld thee. For, oh! to part, plants more than daggers here. [Pointing to his breast. Aph. Parting! what means my emperor? my life? On that word, parting, you have laid a stress Which shakes and terrifies my flutt'ring heart; Why do thy looks thus speak perplexing rage? What fresh commotion tears thee from my arms? Nine tedious moons love gave usurping fame, Yet ere one gentle social day is past, You talk of partingânor reveal the cause. Osm. No, Aphendina; that were most unfit; Thy softness suits not with so rude a theme. Be sure thy Osman will return with speed, Borne on the wings of his impatient love, To calm thy breast, to dissipate thy fears, To breathe new vows, and lull thy heart to peace. Om. Might I advise, my liege should not appear; 'Twere too much honour for such lawless slaves, To yield, or fall by your imperial hand. Depute the sage Effendi in your name, To ask those rebels what they can demand; Proposing terms of grace to such as yield, And punishment to all who dare oppose. Osm. Shall Osman then capitulate with slaves? Effen. No further, Sir, than prudence gives her voice: Calm measures work a salutary end, When force oft stalks with havock crown'd, and blood. Aph. What means my father? what does Omar mean? Why talk ye thus of rebels, and of force? Are then those dangers which we fear'd so nigh? And would my Osman risk his sacred life? You shall not go while I have pow'r to hold. Nay, do not frown; in your contracted brow To me there is more terror than in death. Osm. Forbear, my love; the turbulence of state O'erbears all softer passions of the mind. Aph. I see your frame is shook with shudd'ring rage, Yet do not give the tide of passion way. Leave me not so envelop'd with despair, As sure I shall be if you leave me thus: Think on thy life thy Aphendina's hangs; If hers thou wouldst preserveâoh save thy own. Osm. By holy Zemzem A well, held sacred by the Mahometane., my divided heart Feels the strong fetters of perplexing doubt. My virgin honour shrinking from a stain, With furious impulse stirs my love-sick mind To rouse, and roughly break through am'rous ties: But when I see my Aphendina's tears, Those heav'nly dew drops shed from pity's eye; Then martial fire no more enflames my breast, She melts my heart, and tunes my soul to love. Aph. Thus to the wretch by pallid sickness worn, Who feebly trembles on the verge of life, Comes, fraught with comfort, heav'n's relenting voice. Osm. Go then, Effendi; in my name demand, How they can justify their lawless course: Tell them, that all who patiently submit, And leave to me disposal of their fate, Tho' much unworthy, may perhaps find grace: But if amongst them any should remain, To brave me with rebellion's iron front; Tell such as those, that, like a bolt from heav'n, My vengeful rage shall hurl destruction round: Mercy refus'd shall never smile again. Haste thenâbut, above all, remember this, That as I've put my honour in your hands, That as you are to represent a king, Who speaks to rebels, not to gen'rous foes; You in no point must derogate from that An injur'd monarch should to rebels say. [Effendi goes off one side; Osman, Aphendina, and Omar, the other. [Scene] SCENE the Hippodrome. Orasmin, Alibec, Zama, Rustan, and Janissaries. Oras. Fortune thus far anticipates each wish; Like a kind mother, fill'd with boundless love, She beams upon us most indulgent smiles, And seems to hail us as her darling sons. Alib. I hope, brave friends, each man who now appears In this so godlike, and so just a cause; Firmly resolves to stand it to the last. Oras. Let no false promises betray one heart From sure possession of immortal fame: This pageant emperor perhaps will sooth, And lure with promises of fairest show; But should he once prevail on us to yield, That instant we must fall to shackled slaves. I know he wears a face of policy, Which to promote his ends can smoothly smile; Tho', like earth lab'ring with internal fires, His tyrant mind is hurrican'd with rage. Alib. Let simple souls, who trust delusive eyes, Build their weak faith upon exterior show; I heed it not. Zam. Nor I, my gallant friend. Fair looks and gentle words alike deceive; 'Tis the heart only manifests the man. Rust. Curst be the traitor who can waver now: Let me devote the dearest blood I own, For the attainment of those glorious ends, Which we by force of arms propose to gain. Oras. If, gallant Rustan, all resolve like thee, We shall o'erturn with most successful speed The cobweb schemes of rotten policy, The flimsy produce of that Omar's brain. Alib. He to our fury first shall fall a prey. Zam. His head shall answer for his canker'd heart. Rust. At the Seraglio gate let us demand him. Oras. 'Tis well imagin'd, friend; a step like that, Will give revenge the bitterness of gall. Soon then as night's dun mantle shrouds the globe, And the full orbed moon shall, at her rise, Stream silvery glimmerings o'er the stilly sea; Enforc'd by Melidor's try'd veteran band, From the chill bosom of Tartarian frosts, We'll seize the Dardanelles, and thence proceed To other actions worthy our designs. Alib. Aga, no moreâfor see Effendi comes. Enter Effendi. Effen. Friends I would call ye, but I cannot now; Your acts of violence destroy that name, And break between us ev'ry social tie. Now by my priesthood, from these aged eyes A flood of tears have waited on your crimes: Do you not fear our prophet's vengeful rage, With thunder arm'd, will rivet ye to earth, Who thus against his successor rebel? Against a prince beyond example good? When did a monarch fill our Turkish throne, More eminently just than Osman is; Of brighter glory, or more spotless fame? Is he not kind protector to ye all? Gracious of access, bounteous as the sun; Dauntless in war, and merciful in peace? What can his subjects ask, he has not done? Language is poor to celebrate his praise; Conception barren to so vast a theme: Such is your princeâsay, what would ye have more? Oras. With patience we have heard Effendi speak; But in our turn we must have leave to grieve, Tho' tears perhaps we soldiers cannot shed, For that we see our Mufti's priesthood sham'd, By making truth to prejudice give way. Yet what avails the gloss of eloquence? Since well thou know'st he falls beneath that sphere, In which thy panegyric makes him shine. And though thy Aphendina shares his throne, To be the gilder of his serpent heart, Is much beneath thy rev'rend place and years. But wherefore dost thou comeâto palliate wrongs? To moderate our rage with proffer'd terms? If so, deliver up th'important charge: We have not leisure now for cold debate; Glory invites us, and we must obey. Effen. Glory! mistaken menâsay rather shame: She with dark hand seals up your clouded eyes, Then plants ye in the despicable light Of most abandon'd and ungrateful slaves. Oras. Ha! this is more than patience should endure; But age and priesthood guard from violence, Or we should punish such opprobrious terms. We know too well the merits of our cause, Too strongly feel the wrongs we have endur'd, To need an explanation now from thee. Therefore I say again, fulfil your charge; Speak out your Message briefly, and conclude. Effen. Then thus by me imperial Osman speaks; Demanding wherefore ye assemble thus, With bold hostility, and rebel bands, Striking the peaceful city with dismay? Set forth the grievances which want redress; If any thing oppressive can be found, It shall be kindly rectify'd with speed. Oras. We take him at his word: give Omar up, That private source of ev'ry wrong we know. Effen. What right have you to make so bold a claim? Oras. We make that claim because he is our foe: We have the pow'r, and will command his fate. Alib. The sword shall win what justice seeks in vain. Zam. Words, like the vap'ry air, unheeded pass, While blows compel; and such we must apply. Rust. If your proud prince refuses to comply, At his own peril let him brave our rage. Effen. He bade me say to such as would lay down Their hostile arms, and sue for royal grace; On such, though guilty, would his mercy shine: But if ye still persist in mutiny, That blackest scandal to a soldier's name, He will let loose destruction on your heads. Consider then; let mild forgiveness smile; As countrymen, as fellow subjects, hear; Nor think me bound to ought but public good, When I beseech you to avoid a storm, Which must inevitably wreck ye all. Oras. Think'st thou we'll shrink before a storm of threats, Which fall as light as sportive gossamour, When unsupported by a breath of air, Vainer than bubbles floating down the stream. What! sue for peace, and stipulate the terms! Tell frantic Osman, that he must depose, Or else we are resolv'd, by force of arms, To tear the traitor from his stubborn heart. Our utmost grace will be the set of sun, Which one laps'd hour will sink into the sea: If Omar be not then deliver'd up, Our next demand will in a storm be made, Beneath whose shocks, haply, your monarch falls. [Exeunt Orasmin and party. Effendi solus. Then must I fear his fate approaches nigh: What must I do? or whither bend my course? To tell the emperor of this demand, Will so enrage and rouse his fiery soul, That he'll rush headlong on the rebel crew, And so he must inevitably fall. Minds both of virtue and of reason void, By int'rest, pride, and prejudice, enflam'd, Pay no respect to majesty divine. Oh for some happy medium to appease, And calm the tempest of intestine strife. But while I thus deliberate, the hour, The stinted moments fly towards an end: No weight of business stops the pace of time; Since then it must be told, it should be soon.â Look down, oh holy Mahomet, with smiles, Rebellion's thunder-pregnant cloud dispel; Grant unanimity throughout our land, And kindly give the injur'd Osman peace. [Exit. Enter Osman, Aphendina, and Omar. Osm. I marvel at Effendi's tedious stay; He will not, sure, hold parly with the slaves, And meanly wooe their rebel hearts to peace. Om. I dare presume, my liege, he will do all That prudence can devise to heal these wounds, Nor wrong the majesty he represents. Aph. Fear not; my father's cautious loyalty, Will guard your honour from the smallest stain: Safe it may lodge in his protective care, As does the heart which throbs within his breast. Osm. I hope it may; nay more, I trust it will: Yet there's no reason for such long delay; My message was so peremptor'ly short, He might have brought a speedy answer back. At length he comes to rid me of suspense. Enter Effendi. Osm. Well, my Effendiâwill the slaves submit, Lay down their arms, and bow before our throne? What, silent? they do refuse the proffer'd grace, And dare confront the terrors of our rage. Effen. Great Sir, I cannot speakâhigh swelling griefâ With flowing tears prevents the painful tale. Osm. Now, by our prophet, 'tis unmanly, thus To let thy mother's weakness gain such sway; Nor suits it with thy venerable locks: Speak what thou know'st, and render up thy charge. Effen. Then to be brief; 'tis all compriz'd in this: Your majesty, to gratify their rage, Must give up valiant Omar to their hands. Osm. First hurl them down the precipice of fate; Be base rebellion and her sons extinct, Inverted nature shook thro' ev'ry sphere, Ere Osman gratifies audacious slaves, With the base murder of an honest man. By Mahomet, my fury ne'er was rous'd Before this trait'rous, insolent demand; But now, my lion-heart has caught th'alarm, And bounds to vindicate it's sacred right. That now, ev'n now, shou'd you delay to grant itâ I hope thy words were worthy of thy place, Nor wrong'd the royalty which spoke thro' thee. Effen. Threats and remonstrances alike were vain: Their insolence is deaf, and soars so high; So strongly urges their abhorr'd demand, That you must grant it in the current hour, Or with tempestuous fury they'll advance, And tear the valiant Omar from your arms. Osm. Why, let them come, in thunder, if they will; Dread emblems of an elemental war; With shatt'ring rage o'erturn my palace walls, And fill it's avenues with streams of blood: Plant ev'ry where pale images of death, 'Till reigning horrors shall themselves assail; Yet, like a bulwark, will I stand before, And breast the shocks of fate to save my friend. Om. Most gracious sov'reign, let me humbly beg To save a people, I may singly fall: My date of life, by nature, is but short: These locks have long been frosted o'er with time; A few years thus are happily dispos'd, And, I shall triumph in the pangs of death, Tho' ling'ring torture should exhaust its rage, That my frail being could my country save From savage rebels thirsting after blood. Effen. Oh, miracle of loyalty and truth! Tho' my heart bleeds in sorrow for the fate Which tears so good a subject from his prince; Yet, I must join in Omar's pious suit; Which Iâas heav'n shall bless me at my latest hourâ Would freely make, so circumstanc'd, my own: Consider, Sir, you cannot save him now; Delay is but accumulating woe; You give him up but to preserve your life, Your sacred life, on which the nation hangs. Osm. By Israsil, it is a mean resource, For preservation of precarious life, Thus, timidly, to sacrifice my friend. What man so base to prize a poor existence? Lost to each nobler feeling of the mind? Aph. Then, Osman has forgot his tender love; The phantom glory has engross'd his heart: Canst thou for ever, Aphendina lose? Wilt thou embark upon a stormy flood, And leave me trembling helpless on the shore? Compliance may produce a gentle calm, And save from wrechedness this swelling breast. Osm. Compliance! call it by a fitter name, The tame submission of an abject mind; Shall traitors boast, they have driv'n me to a goal, And that I now thro' abject fear comply? No; lion like I'll stand at glorious bay, And deal death round me with vindictive rage; If overpow'r'd, and sunk with wounds, I fall, Like mighty Julius of the Roman state, 'Tis better far than infamy and life. Aph. Then goâbut first transpierce this throbbing heartâ Dismiss me kindly from a wretched world: Thou would'st not leave me to seditious rage, Or fall a martyr in my blasted sight? Think, in that dark, that wretched hour of fate? How dire distraction will usurp my breast; Reason depos'd by wild unbounded grief, No more will govern my afflicted mind, But crouding horrors stab in every thought. Osm. Probe not the deep recesses of my heart, Where fondness sits enthron'd, to plead thy cause. Aph. If the sad picture of my single woe Should want due influenceâlook further still; Cast thy eyes round, and view a gen'ral wreck; Behold your native land o'erspread with flames, Hear dying groans approach with ev'ry gale; See helpless innocence and feeble age Unpitied fall beneath the murd'ring sword; Unnumber'd lisping babes hold up their hands, As many weeping mothers on their knees, To thee, their kind, and common parent sue: If thy poor country, trembling on the brink Of gaping ruin, can impress thy heart; If supplicating millions may be heard, No longer hesitate, but yield to love; To its domestic, and its patriot calls; To them, tho' not to daring rebels yield. Effen. Let us implore your majesty to think; Each circumstance will urge you to comply, If duly weigh'd in calm reflection's scale. Osm. Is calm reflection fit for such a time, When warring passions thus besiege my heart? Om. Since 'tis resolv'd I must a victim fall, There is no diff'rence in the space of time; Approaching death may conscious guilt appall, While honesty, invulnerable, smiles At the weak efforts of his feeble rage. I am prepar'd, and matter not how soon. Aph. Oh, painful exigence, which makes me plead To yield the life of such unshaken zeal; But swift wing'd time and hov'ring fate conjoin, To urge, reluctantly, the mournful suit. Behold thy Aphendina, on her knees, Humbly implores it at her Osman's feet; With heaving heart, and streaming eyes, implores, And, if refus'd, will never rise again; But, on the bosom of her parent earth Groan out her life, and fly a world of care. Osm. No more, my Aphendina, weep no more; Thy tears have conquer'd, and I must submit: Thou rul'st my heart with arbitrary sway; Like a tame infant, it obeys thy will, And exiles bleeding friendship from my breast. Om. May all the blessings of a prosp'rous reign, May glorious peace attend your latest years: May base rebellion ne'er again have pow'r To raise its serpent crest against your sway: May our great prophet guard your sacred life; And if war's crimson banners are unfurl'd, Propitious smile on your victorious arms 'Till fame shall sound no other name but yours, Thro' distant worlds, when Omar is no more; Who gladly pays the life he owes his prince; That Life, which, one time, nature would have claim'd By death, th'unerring messenger of heav'n, Mask'd in the character of some disguise. Osm. Omar, it is not now a time for words, They only serve to multiply my griefs; Therefore, one last embrace, and then, farewell: My tried, my stedfast, and most valu'd friend, To lose thee thus; to think for what we part, Is worse than daggers to my bleeding heart [Exeunt Osman, Aphendina, on one side; Effendi, and Omar, on the other.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Almira and Fatima. Fatima, Madam, so far your wishes and success Go hand in hand together.âThis proud prince Is render'd pliable to any terms: Omar's surrender is an ample proof. Alm. When I reflect upon the tort'ring pangs, Which wound and rack his Aphendina's heart, Mine bounds triumphant on a flood of joy. That fair invader of my peaceful mind, Whose rival charms first robb'd me of content, Shall feel too late, neglected as I am, That I can triumph o'er her transient sway. Fat. While, like the moon, her fainter sickly beams Shall yield their lustre to the rising sun. Alm. What most transcendent pleasure will it give, To see her prostrate fall at pity's Shrine, A mournful monument of jealous rage! Almira, mounted upon eagle's wings, From the high pyramid of great revenge, Smiling shall view her trembling prey below. Fat. Almira ev'ry way transcends her sex, Through all the various movements of her mind, By nature fram'd for universal sway. Alm. And yet, good Fatima, to thee I'll own A secret unthought weakness of my heart: Rous'd as I am by raging jealousy, A gleam of fondness shoots across my breast, And Osman's fate draws tribute from my eyes. Fat. My royal mistress, lavish not your tears: Can falshood claim so rich a sacrifice? Has he not wrong'd you with unjust disgrace; Abjur'd his vows, and slighted matchless charms? Alm. He has; he has: hence ev'ry fond regard Yield to the dictates of assaulted pride. Mount hate implacable, with dire revenge, In horrid pomp, the throne of injur'd love; Blot from remembrance ev'ry softer view; Depict the traitor savage and forsworn; That no false feeling, no relenting thought, May check the chastisement my wrongs demand. Fat. Madam, behold the prince. Alm. He comes, I trust, To keep alive and gratify my rage. Fat. His business may require your private ear, Whence it becomes my duty to retire. [Exit Fatima. Enter Solan. Sol. Still would I come the messenger of joy To fair Almiraâbut dearest wishes Too oft in life are turn'd to fortune's sport: So now are mine. Alm. What mean those doubtful words? Why does thy soul, shrunk back upon itself, Deny a wonted vigour to thy eyes? Why are thy features languid and dismay'd, When great atchievements call for active zeal? What change; what circumstance; what trait'rous heart; Can dash our tow'ring hopes? Sol. Hear then a change Most unexpectedâfatal too, I fear: Orasmin, faction's most advent'rous sonâ Full of that consequence which pow'r bestows, And holding us but secondary means; With bold ingratitude has breath'd a vow, To settle Mustapha in regal sway. Alm. How! Mustapha! my known establish'd foe; The first grand instrument of my disgrace, Death of my hopes, and bane of my repose. Sol. E'en him; that shade of royalty and pow'r, Will mount the Turkish throne. Alm. He never shall: Ere that, this hand should stab him to the heart. Shall proud Orasmin then dispose the crown, Nor ask concurrence of Almira's voice? Have I employ'd my friends, and pledg'd my faith, To pour my treasure forth in golden streams? Cast all my weight into the public scale, To be so insignificant at last. Sol. There base contempt shoots forth its keenest sting, And gives a pois'nous wound to honest pride. How low is laid our boasted triumph now! Our scheme of bliss, how vanish'd into air, With empire, honour; nay, and just revenge! Alm. Words cannot speak astonishment like mine, Nor rage express the anguish of my heart. To fall yet lower have I ventur'd life; Kindled a flame which blood alone can quench; Persuaded thee to sacrifice thy friend; And all to make this Mustapha a king, Who more than all mankind deserves my hate? Sol. All that by calm remonstrance could be done, Mingled with threats of spirited import, I try'd to check Orasmin's pride in vain. Sneering he said, in points of consequence You must be satisfy'd to bear control: Remark'd, that love alone deserv'd my care, And swore his resolution should take place. Alm. Audacious traitor! oh that my kindled rage Might burst like fate on his ambitious head. Sol. I now shall meet with universal scorn, Have pointing fingers wheresoe'er I go, And censure's aspic tongue to wound my name. Nay, ev'n the purchase of my guilty love, Almira too will be for ever lost. That one reflection fills my breast with pangs More terrible than could approaching death. Alm. Death! 'tis the only cure for woe like ours; Orasmin there at least we can defeat. Take then this dagger; find Almira's heart, And let thy love, if love can yet remain For such a wretch, strike an unerring blow. Yet one thing more, before we part for ever: Let thy forgiveness smooth the bed of death. And lay me smiling in the peaceful grave. Sol. This is the sole request I could refuse. But if the wound which clos'd thy lovely eyes, Would purchase for me everlasting peace, Nay, give me back my pure unsully'd fame, I could not force my arm to strike the blow; Besides, if thought, which now informs my soul, Divines aright, all may be well again With us, and with the state. Alm. Speak, Solan, speak; And wind me to the purpose as you please. Sol. Let feign'd compliance with Orasmin's scheme Lull to security that haughty chief, While, by slow measures, we withdraw our friends; Those, join'd to loyal citizens, who mourn, And look with horror on this base revolt; Will soon bear fortune's scale to Osman's side, Then will he give Almira to my arms, In gratitude, for empire so restor'd. Alm. 'Tis done; and now he's emperor again; No longer victim to my jealous hate. Orasmin, yet shall bend beneath my pow'r, And curse the pride which marks me out his foe. Swift as the flying minute let me haste And check the courseâ Sol. Let prudence be your guide, And with slow secrecy effect our wish; For, on a dreadful precipice we stand, Verging to fate's immeasurable gulph: Use the same means which wrought this tempest up; Divide with caution, and destroy its force. Alm. 'Tis well advis'd, and passion shall be rein'd, That, like convulsive fires, enwomb'd in earth; Freed it may burst with tenfold fury forth; I'll set those subtle ministers at work, Who blew the sparks of mutiny to flame, And make them stop its desolating course. My rage, which cherish'd, shall this tempest lay, Dispel its gloom, and give a new-born day; Heav'n's awful voice thus whirling thro' the air, O'erspreads the face of nature with despair: Loud peals of thunder undulate the sky, And blasting flames of sheeted light'ning fly, To shew vain mortals, that almighty pow'r Incens'd to rage, creation can devour; But chuses still, thro' lenity, to save, Nor give wreck'd worlds an everlasting grave. [Exit Almira. Manet Solan. Sol. Guilt thou art darkâa winter of the mind; Continual tempests, and impervious gloom; Boist'rous as Neptune's agitated flood; Hell to the heart, and poison to repose: Why did I then o'er peril's fearful brink Plunge headlong in thy gulph?â Enter Zama. What dost thou mean? Uncall'd, unwanted, thus without reserve To break untimely on my private thoughts. Zam. Excuse me, prince, nor blame a just respect; A dervise, for his garb bespeaks him such, Roughly demands, in haste, your private ear, Knowing the wild disorder of this time; Momentous, perilous, and big with fate, I check'd admittance to consult your leave. Sol. Caution was well; but let him now approach, [Exit Zama. 'Till I have cast this burthen from my breast, Mankind can show no other cause of fear, Equal to that which conscience plants within; Blunt but her stings, and death may frown in vain. Osman, as a Dervise, discovers himself. Osm. Well may'st thou start when Osman thus appears, To tax thee with the meanest, worst of crimes, Shameful ingratitudeâthe vice of man, Unknown to ought that lives and moves beside. The fellest monsters of the desart wood, The wildest wing'd inhabitant of air, The scaly race which sport in lucid streams, By acts of friendship may be won to love; While man, the reasonable viper, takes Favours bestow'd by unsuspecting hands, Yet schemes to wound the bounteous breast that gives. Sol. The just and keen reproach flies through my heart. Osm. Thou see'st me here a fall'n abandon'd king, By foes insulted, and betray'd by friends; Then finish boldy what thou hast begun, And with thy sword, the pledge of former love, That weak regard which once I own'd for thee, Let forth the stream of royalty and life: And see, to make thee surer of my fate, Lest coward guilt should strike too faint a blow, I bare my breast; now kill me if thou dar'st. Sol. First buried be the point within this heart. Oh, mighty, gracious, and most injur'd king, Could human pow'r unfold my tortur'd mind, Solan, this treach'rous Solan, would appear The wounded proselyte of deep remorse. But mercy cannot reach my daring crime, Therefore to justice I'll resign my life, And humbly supplicate the gracious boon. Osm. What is thy life, abandon'd slave, to me? Thy very soul is poor to loss of fame. Sol. True, royal Sirâyet 'tis my all to pay. Oh let me curse that evil fated hour, When fiends of darkness hov'ring round my head, Devoted me the prey of shameful love. Love, which like wand'ring lights that oft mislead Benighted travellers, allur'd my steps From paths of honour to the paths of shame. Osm. Cease th'unhallow'd licence of thy tongue, Nor thus prophane, to patch up an excuse, The noblest feeling of the human heart. Love! 'tis the essenceâ'tis the light of life; And beauteous woman, thro' creation's round, Heav'n's choicest blessing to its fav'rite man. Love! I have felt the soft Ã¦therial flame; Own all its influence with a subject heart: Yet honourâwhich thy bosom never knew, Reigns such a ruling principle within, That love nor fate could ever shake its throne. Sol. What can, my sov'reign, conscious guilt reply? If boundless penitence has ought to plead, Be it my claim; nor would I bear the load, The galling load of life a moment more, But that a prospect of my prince restor'd Brightens the gloom, and palliates despair. Osm. Presuming slave! as impotent as base; When once up-torn the lordly oak has felt, And fall'n beneath the shock of thund'ring storms, What hand can fix it in the native seat? Sol. Weak as it is, my arm shall prove the task, Or give this hateful being to the earth. Osm. Can life, the fleeting shadow of a shade, Deck'd with that thorny, worthless gewgaw, pow'r, Have charms for majesty on terms so vile? No; let me suffer the severest fate, Feel tortur'd life pursu'd thro' ev'ry limb, Ere traitors shame me with the stile of friends. If yet an honest, loyal heart remains, Together we'll rush on, together rise, Or fall together in one glorious grave. [Going. Sol. Yet hold, great Sir; let me feel all your scorn; Let injur'd friendship pierce this faithless heart, Yet as a patriot guard your sacred life. I dare not, cannot, must not let you pass, Till holy Mahomet has launch'd the bolt, Which soon will cast sedition to the earth. It hangs already o'er rebellious heads; Time with imp'd wings posts forward to their fate, And loyalty prepares triumphant joy. Osm. Curse on the smoothness of that flatt'ring tongue, Which lodg'd thee first a serpent in my breast. Hence stand aloof, nor wound with tainted touch An injur'd monarch, and deluded friend. This world affords no punishment for thee; But in the nextâobserve prophetic truth, Mark it, and tremble at the awful sound, When Israsil shall rouse th'awaken'd dead, Hell's hottest plagues shall rack thy treach'rous soul. [Exit. Sol. Yet in his own despight I'll try to save; 'Tis the sole balm to sooth my wounded heart. Zama, come forth.â Enter Zama. On swiftest wings of speed Haste to the Hippodrome, or wheresoe'er Intelligence can find our warmest friends; Bid Osmar, Alabas, and valiant Hasan, Collect their bands for such a glorious deed, As panting fame ne'er register'd before. Haste as if empire hung upon thy steps, While I by other methods seek such force As great occasion callsâthat ere, my friend, The lucid eastern herald of the morn Peeps thro' the azure vestment of the sky, Justice and virtue may assert their reign. [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. Aphendina and Elisana. Aph. Thy care, my Elisana, is in vain; I must and will indulge my flowing tears, Take dark despair for ever to my breast, Abhor to hear the name of comfort more, Nor ever see the chearing face of day. Night's gloomy shade, the emblem of her woe, Will best befit lost Aphendina now; Where far sequester'd from a bustling world, Her wounded mind may ruminate on care; 'Till weary worn-out nature sinks to rest, And death winds up the fatal tragedy. Elis. Hope yet, my royal mistress, hope the best, Tho' fortune's present frowns are most severe, And call for patience in its utmost force; We are not yet beyond the verge of hope. Aph. Perhaps thou art notâthat avails not me; 'Tis much the same to thee who lives and reigns; Some tears of gratitude, perhaps may fall, To see me struggling with tyrannic fate: But still, thy heart can feel no pang like mine; Thou canst not lose an emperor, an Osman, That wretchedness belongs to me alone. Elis. I truly mourn, my queen, to see you thus; My sympathizing heart partakes your woe; For pity's sake, restrain those flowing tears, Osman, perhaps, may triumph o'er his foes, Return with joy, and bless you with his love. Aph. I am too wretched now for flatt'ry's voice; Too sure, my Osman never will return, My widow'd heart forebodes he never will: He could no longer curb his raging soul, But headlong rush'd to brave the rebel band. Perhaps, my Elisana, ev'n now He is encircled by the ruffian crew, Who thirst to revel in his royal blood. Elis. Indulge not fancy, in her airy flight, Nor call such dreadful pictures to your view. Aph. Methinks, I see their sabres brandish'd high, Prepar'd to wound his faithful sacred breast; Hold, bloody villains; stop your butch'ring hands, Nor bring eternal ruin on the land By the fell murder of so good a kingâ Or, if he must to malice fall a prey, First, strike this heart, destroy this hopeless wretch, And I will bless ye for the friendly blow, Which spares the torture to behold him die. Elis. Madam, alas! you're absent in your thoughts, And wander from yourself you know not whereâ Behold, your venerable father comes, Perhaps his tidings may afford some ease. Enter Effendi. Aph. Are such sad eyes the harbingers of joy? To me, they rather pregnant seem with woe: Oh, father, to my eager wish, thou'rt come With comfort to compose my lab'ring grief, Or else to plunge in absolute despair. Effen. Prepare thy heart, for what must deeply wound: Would I had died before the dire mischance Which makes me messenger of such a tale; Thy Osman isâI cannot utter more. Aph. Dead, thou wouldst say, but for thy streaming tearsâ What, dost thou want it, and have I the pow'r To speak, that certain, dreadful close of fate: My Osman dead! let nature too expire Thro ev'ry clime; let desolation reign, Horror, distraction, and eternal woeâ Oh, glorious sun! no more display thy beams, But shroud the world in everlasting night; No more the fertile earth her tribute yield, Nor teem with ought but wretchedness and plagues, To make posterity atone the deed, The impious deed of shedding Osman's blood. Effen. I own, thy griefs may well excuse thy rage, Yet suffer calmer reason to prevail. Aph. Good father, do not mock thy daughter's woe, Is reason fit for Aphendina's state; The mind becalm'd from care can reason well, They are philosophers who feel no pain, But, plung'd in such unutterable grief, Amid such hurricanes it cannot rule, To stop the rapid whirlings of the brainâ Great heav'n, in justice to the sins of men, Let epidemic madness seize on all; And, as I am pre-eminent in grief, Depute me queen of the distracted world. Effen. Yet, gentle daughter, set thy passion bounds, Nor rend thy heart with sympathetic pain, To calm thy anguish, know, great Osman lives. Aph. What angel-voice did Aphendina hear, To lure attention with its magic sound? If he still livesâsay, where's my gentle love?â Why comes he not, to take me from the rack, The dreadful rack of crowding doubts and fears. Effen. Alas! my child, he feels the weight of chains; Surpris'd by numbers of his rebel foes, As in a dervise garb he pass'd along; Sedition mark'd and grasp'd him for its prey, While in rude triumph he was led along To that sad dungeon where he's doom'd to lie: Such majesty was pictur'd in his eyes, He seem'd superior, and look'd down on fate; Think, oh, my daughter; at a sight like this, What racking pangs shot thro' thy father's heart, While gushing tears stream'd down his furrow'd cheeks. Aph. Oh, 'twas a sight might melt the hardest heartâ Yet, that he lives, to me affords some ease, Tho' on life's verge he stands, he still is mine, And, I will once more fold him in my arms. Effen. Somewhat remains to give thee farther ease, Solan, the Georgian prince, shot cross my way, Haste in his steps, and business on his brow; Said, he repented of his late revolt, And, that Almira, foundress of these griefs, Will speedily withdraw her num'rous friends; Then bade good cheer, and swiftly pass'd along. Aph. Is there such prospect of returning bliss; May we rely upon this flatt'ring change? Effen. Life yields no certainty whereon to rest; Changes encircle us in ev'ry state; Yet here, I think, we may with reason hope; I know the people brook not Osman's chains Without much discontent and sharp regret; Faction divided once, will lose its force, Then loyalty reviving, must prevail, And drive rebellion from the groaning land. Aph. In those kind words I feel the cherub hope Refreshing smile on my afflicted mind; Oh, father! thou pour'st balm into my woundsâ With racking pangs my heart no longer bleeds; To raging storms succeeds a gentle calm; Yet still I feel my anxious bosom heave With doubts, lest wav'ring fortune should deceive; Thus, when rude winds make temp'rate seas arise, 'Till mounting billows wash the distant skies; Tho' all the fury of the tempest cease, 'Tis long before the surges sink to peace. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Orasmin and Alibec. Oras. Now, by our prophet, thou'rt my choicest friend, The very life, the essence of our cause, And may'st depend upon that high reward Thy vigilance and constancy deserve; The master point already we have gain'd, For Osman now is most securely ours. Alib. So far, indeed, prosperity attends, We have the dang'rous lion in our toils, From whence we must not let him 'scape with life. Oras. Could Alibec suggest a thought of life, No, in that point my resolution's fix'd; I will myself behold him suffer death, My eyes I'll glut with his convulsive pangs, And feast my ears with his departing groans. Alib. Why is not royal Mustapha proclaim'd? I thought ere this to've seen him mount the throne. Oras. Thou know'st, since Osman has assum'd the pow'r, Which, as but guardian Mustapha possess'd; This Mustapha has led a life recluse, And from a monarch to a dervise shrunk: When I demanded him to wear the crown, Sway'd by religion, and its sickly qualms; He said, he'd not usurp his nephew's right, Never reign emperor while Osman lives. Alib. Curse on his dastard soul, which could refuse. Oras. Thou speak'st my thoughtsâbut yet we'll have him crown'd, Dispatching Osman will determine all, Promote our views, and dissipate his fears. Once on the throne, we'll wind him as we please; He shall be emperor, but we'll hold the rule. Alib. I would that time was happily arriv'd. Oras. Thought sees not that which can prevent our course, With full swell'd sails, we fly before the wind, And fortune now has push'd us on so far, Adversity must lag in the pursuit, For reason's more than I can speak at large. This proud Almira must be taken off, Haly, her fav'rite eunuch, may be won, To give her, privately, a fatal draught; Once dead, we will secure her party ours, Dress up a plausible affecting tale, That, by the friends of Osman she has fall'n; This will bind Solan firmly to our side, Whom now I view as wav'ring and unfix'd. Alib. There policy reveal'd its deepest scheme, I'll haste and tamper with the slave you've nam'd, And wind him to the purpose which we wish; By specious promises of large reward; His business doneâhe too must be dispatch'd, And then all's silent as the cave of death. Oras. Thou art the very echo of my heart, Which dare repose its dearest care with thee, Haste then, my friend, and quick be thy return, Success depends upon thy speed alone. Alib. Conclude it then most confidently ours. [Exit Alibec. Orasmin solus. The sun of greatness rises on my hopes, And gives a bright horizon to the view. The flame of discontent which spreads around, Now lights me forward with propitious rays: There's not a slave throughout the rabble croud, But thinks he's posting to immortal fame. Oh liberty! how oft thy shade deceives, And leads the frantic populace astray? By the kind influence of thy magic name, I have gain'd thousands to assert my cause, And serve as footsteps to exalt my rise. For howsoe'er I talk of private wrongs, Of proud oppression, and the public good, Self stands the pinnacle of daring hope. My schemes dispos'd as now, I cannot fail, For I have barr'd each avenue of fate: She, like a river pent in narrow bounds, Which labours strongly to o'erbear its mounds, When well oppos'd by a superior force, Beneath restraint will keep a proper course; But if the smallest breach a passage yields, It pours destructive o'er the neighb'ring fields; In its wide deluge desolation reigns And sweeps away the harvest of the plains. [Exit. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Osman solus, chain'd. Thou undissembling counsellor of kings, Faithful adversityâfrom thee I learn A truth, yet strange, that I'm no more than man; What now is Osman, whom the world rever'd? Do these rude fetters suit imperial limbs? Is this sad dungeon lodgment for a king, This canopy of damps, this couch of flint, This dreary solitude, and lightless gloom? Yet, heav'n, I pine not at thy just decree, Which makes me more acquainted with myself; In spight of bonds the mind is always free, And claims unconquerable liberty: Yet, when I think of Aphendina's grief, The tort'ring pangs her tender bosom feels; I own, captivity attacks my heart, I feel her misery, tho' not my own; Should in my absence violence assail, She has no pow'r to stop its rude approach: I must not thinkâIt is too much to bearâ The very thought breeds raging anarchy, 'Tis now I feel; I murmur at my chains, And groan beneath the cruelty of fate. Enter Almira. Alm. Wrapp'd in his sorrows, emblem of this gloom, Lo! where the ruin of great Osman stands A royal sacrifice to jealous rage: Come, let me rouse him up to just reproach, To curses, on the author of his woe. Osm. What rays of beauty streak surrounding clouds, And give this dungeon artificial light; Almira! ha! Alm. Well may'st thou feel surprize, And indignation, to behold me here; Let thy looks, kindling, teem with fire-ey'd rage, And thy words speak like thunder to my heart, For I deserve it all. Osm. Almira, no; Thus self-accus'd, I should disgrace my heart To entertain one wrathful thought of thee, Our destiny's resolv'd on mutual plagues, Touch'd thy soft bosom with successless love, And turn'd my wishes quite another course; Yet, none could be Almira's faster friend, No eyes confess her beauties more than Osman's. Alm. How thy last words enchant my ravish'd ears, But, what is friendship to a heart like mine; Cold as the touch of winter's icy hand, I saw thee capable of tender love, Yet could not find thee capable to me; This made me wish the ruin of the world, And madly give up all my world in thee: But, now repenting, I abjure my crime, Such savage passion, and for pardon sue. Osm. If my forgiveness can procure thee peace, I willingly acquit thee of all guilt, And place thee in remembrance white as snow. Alm. Oh matchless dignity of soul like heav'n, To cast all thoughts of injury aside! Haste, Solan, haste, at suff'ring virtue's call, Lead on resistless our determin'd friends; From galling fetters set thy monarch free, And give him quickly to his people's love. Osm. Thou'st nam'd a traitor, whom my soul abhors, Nor would I taste of favour from his hand. No; let me rather groan out wretched life In vile captivity, than have it said, I ow'd my freedom to so base a wretch. Alm. Base he may seem; yet cast his guilt on me; Unhappy love has render'd him my slave. With deep reluctance of an anguish'd heart, To me he sacrific'd his truth and fame; But now with loyalty reviv'd he comes, To give you freedom, or to forfeit life. Osm. I think no longer of protracted days, I stand prepar'd, and willing now to die. Alm. No; let the cave of peaceful death be mineâ Ha!âsure his angel hears my fervent wish, And kindly comes to set Almira free. Osm. Either th'imperfect light deceives my eyes, Or in thy looks some wond'rous change appears. Alm. Wond'rous indeedâyet welcome to my heart; Tho' my blood feels like flame within my veins, And crouding pangs fly upward to my brain; Tormenting visions hang before my sight: See Aphendina smilesâthou wert the cursed causeâ Lo base Orasmin bath'd in Osman's blood: Relentless savageâHa! 'tis just revengeâ The villain floats upon a sea of fire; And now he sinks beneath the sulph'rous waves. Osm. Her thoughts are wand'ring in distraction's maze, And agony sits staring in her eyes. Almira! Alm. Stand off, and touch me not: Contagion wraps me roundâI'm torture allâ Lo in my breath fly pestilence and plagues. Oh glorious thought! I'll find the rebel crew, And thro' their trait'rous ranks destruction spread, More fell than all the instruments of war; Rush like the blast of lightning from on high, Give Osman safety, and contented die. [Exit. Osm. When stormy passions of malignant kind Take rude possession of a female heart, Then angel softness turns to bitter rage, Deforming beauty with a wint'ry gloom. What wild repentance stings her tortur'd mind? Why, reason, dost thou leave us to ourselves In the perplexing labyrinth of life, The sport of folly, or the prey of vice? Enter Effendi. Surprize, Effendi, sits upon thy brow. Is there a chance in fickle fortune's store, Beyond what: thy experience might suppose. Effen. My sacred lord, I know not how it is, But unexpected death must give a shock Ev'n to the numbness of unfeeling age. Almira, lately beauty's blooming pride, (Would that her mind had rivall'd outward charms) Struck by the arm of never-erring fate, Just in the portal to this house of woe, Fell at my feet, and with a groan expir'd. Osm. Dead! then treachery has mark'd her for its prey: Why, why so long has it delay'd with me? Yet one wish still employs my lab'ring thoughts, Binds me to life, and its incumb'ring cares: Dost thou not wonder to behold me weep? But solid rocks, when cleft, have yielded streams. Ev'n so my stubborn heart transpierc'd with grief, Dissolves in tears, and issues at my eyes. Thou know'st there is but one, one only pow'r, Almighty love, who could such tribute claim; Bring Aphendina to these widow'd arms; Oh! give her to my fond, despairing eyes, And claim as much as gratitude can pay. Effen. Alas! my liege, what pangs have I endur'd, To hear the darling of my aged heart, To hear my poor distracted daughter rave; Now melt in tears, then raging blaze again; 'Till sunk beneath the pressure of her woe, She loads with sighs the drooping wings of time. Osm. Does Aphendina then feel so much pain, And Osman's heart lie quiet in his breast? Must I, who am the cause of all her grief, Be calm; nor share the hurricane of fate? No; I'll no longer curb my swelling rage, But give at once the brooding passions scope; Curse all mankind, but chiefly curse myself, Who, coward like, have shrunk into these chains. Oh! I could stab, or tear my dastard heart, Which rous'd not up at sacred honour's call; Which was not steel'd 'gainst eloquence or love; Which rush'd not, fury-fraught, amidst its foes, To live a monarch, or a monarch fall. Effen. Patience, my royal lord, repenting fate Appears dispos'd to make you large amends; Solan is working for the great event Of restoration, and of future peace. In the mean time, to mitigate your woes, The guards surrounding this inglorious cell Have had his orders to admit your friends; And lo! my liege, where Aphendina comesâ I'll haste abroad, and use my influence, To strengthen and to speed returning loyalty. [Exit Effendi. Enter Aphendina. Osm. Thou life of Osman, and his source of joy, How does thy presence chear the face of woe, Subdue captivity, and make it smile! Aph. Do I again embrace my royal lord? I did not think I should behold thee more, Unless in death-like majesty array'd, Rob'd in the habit of the awful tomb, With bloodless visage, and with rigid limbs. Tyrannic fancy the sad picture drew, And struck unnumber'd terrors thro' my breast. Had'st thou but known, my love, the pain I feltâ Osm. I felt it all, and with superior force. Since last I saw my Aphendina's smiles, 'Till this blest moment, I have known no joy: This gloomy dungeon echo'd with my groans, And this damp earth was flooded with my tears. Think when thy Osman was reduc'd to weep, He must have felt unutterable woe. Aph. 'Tis woe indeed which calls forth tears like thine. My gentle love, thou dost look wond'rous pale; The wonted fires have all forsook thy eyes; Languid and sunk they seem with sallow care: But 'tis not strange in such a change of state; Snatch'd from the glory of imperial sway, Chain'd in this pinfold cavern like a slave, Secluded from the cheering rays of light, Envelop'd with a dim nocturnal gloom, And noisome damps from these rough flinty walls, Which seem to weep in pity of thy fate; Softer in nature than those rebel hearts, Whose treachery has sunk thee down so low. Osm. I can despise it all, and laugh at fate; With thee I am an emperor again: I truly reign, my love, when thou art near, For then I'm monarch of a world of joy. Aph. If so, my love, I'll never leave thee more, But unrepining share thy flinty couch, Softer with thee than richest beds of down. The tedious hours shall plume their wings afresh, With social converse, and repeated vows; And when exhausted nature seeks repose, With fond embrace I'll lock thee to thy rest. Osm. Now, by our prophet, 'tis too much of bliss. Seize, seize, ambition; mount my vacant throne, And fix my crown on thy aspiring brows, While comfort gilds this solitary cell: Pleas'd, at an humble distance I shall view The rapid whirl of fortune's restless wheel, And smile to see her fluster'd fav'rite's fall. Enter three mutes, one holding a bow-string. Aph. Alas! my love, what horrid slaves are these, Whose mystic silence, and whose murd'rous looks, Strike a chill terror to my shiv'ring heart? Osm. I know 'em; they're the ministers of fate, Who come to free thy Osman from his chains, And bring a passport to a better life. Aph. Must Aphendina then her Osman lose? For ever lose? how dreadfully that sounds! What strength have I to bear the painful thought! What pow'r to keep distraction from my brain! Osm. Give not, my love, such scope to frantic grief, Thou wilt heap torments on my parting soul. Death has no terror to the good and brave, Permit me then to meet him with a smile, 'Twill check his malice, and unsting his dart. Aph. I cannot rule the tempest raging here; A flood of anguish gathers round my heart, And bursts its passage at my streaming eyes. Osm. If possible, my love, conceal thy tears, Lest that thy softness should infect my breast: I would seem ready to embrace my fate, And scorn to show the shadow of concern. Enter Orasmin. Oras. Wherefore, ye tardy villains, this delay? I thought to've found the tyrant in his pangs, Gasping for life, and cursing me in death: Seize on him strait, and execute my will. Osm. Stand off, ye slaves, and tremble at my nod. Wherefore, Orasmin, dost thou seek my life, And brand me with a tyrant's hated name? Oras. Because that title and thy deeds agree. Aph. Canst thou hear this, O Mahomet, in peace, Nor cast a vengeful thunder-bolt of fate At such an impious and abandon'd wretch? Oras. I came not here to be inform'd of faults, And female monitors my soul disdains. Reproach from thee resembles babbling gales, Which pass unheeded by neglecting ears: But mercy's lavish'd giving time for words; Therefore I say, ye hesitating slaves, Indulge my vengeance, and dispatch him strait. [Two mutes seize Osman; the third prepares the bow-string. Aph. Hear, pitying heav'n, oh! hear my fervent pray'r; Let everlasting plagues pursue this fiend; Vent all your fury on his guilty head, And rack him with eternity of pain. Osm. Allow me one embrace, then take me all. [Mutes let Osman go. Now, Aphendina, fare thee well at onceâ The pains of hell are center'd in my heart, To think I shall behold that face no more. Burst, burst, my soul, from out thy earthly cage; Let not the streams of weakness flood my eyes, Left that this traitor should enjoy my woe, And smile to see his emperor in tears. [Mutes approach Osman reluctantly. Aph. I will not lose thee; I will share in death: Oh! for a lion's strength to aid our cause, And snatch thee from Orasmin's bloody fangs. Oras. Why do ye tremble so, reluctant slaves; This moment execute what I command, And prove yourselves brought up in schools of blood, Or, take from me that death you fear to give. [Mutes seize Osman, and put on the bow-string. Osm. Now, now, my Aphendina, Osman goes: Some pitying angel, with thy gentlest care, Compose the anguish of thy lab'ring breast. Aph. Pity disdains to aid a wretch like me; 'Tis this alone can rid me of despair. [Aphendina stabs herself. Osm. Stand off, and let me catch her ere she falls; Do I then live to see thy vital stream, This sacred tribute of unequal'd love. Oras. 'Tis wellâin part this gratify's revengeâ For, more he feels her anguish than his ownâ [Shout. But hark! what means that near approaching shout? This way it comesâI fear some change of fate; Quick then, ye murd'ring ministers, dispatch, That no event may interrupt revenge. [Shout, while the Mutes are seizing Osman; Solan, Zama, with guards, rush in, disarm Orasmin, and take him prisoner. Sol. Wretches avaunt, and set your monarch free, From the unhallow'd grasp of impious hands. Osm. Hold off, ye fiends; my Aphendina faintsâ Behold herâam I indeed awake?â Sol. Once more we bend to hail our sov'reign lord, Casting repentant hearts beneath his feet; We joy to hail him emperor again. Osm. 'Tis now too late to triumph in that name, Recover'd glory withers with my love. Effen. Oh, cruel chance of unrelenting fate; Oh, heavy woe to crush my sinking years. Aph. My father come to bless me ere I die, And Osman to his dignities restor'd, Are comforts I expected not to find, Which shed a balm on my expiring heartâ My swimming eyes resign the pow'r of sight; Objects are lost in one impervious cloud, And icy chilness shoots thro' ev'ry veinâ Take, take me, Osman, in thy circling arms, And, on thy lips receive my parting breathâ Farewel, my loveâoh, nowâfarewel for everâ [Dies. Osm. Help, help, to hold her from that tyrant, death; Help me, Effendi, to preserve her mine. Sol. Alas! my liege; she's past the verge of life: The calls of empire summon you to leave This melting scene, and re-assume your throne. Osm. Is it in empire to revive my love? Can empire animate that beauteous form? Can empire give that world of charms again, And re-unite us in the bands of joy? Sol. Alas! my liege; the stretch of human pow'r Falls short of such miraculous effects. Osm. Then talk no more of empire, and of life: Empire, the pageantry and pride of kings; The pompous attributes of regal sway Shall never bribe me to a life of care; Nor gild the mansion of eternal woeâ I'm now beyond the cruelty of fate, Her keenest dart lies buried in my breast; And, to defeat the triumph of her wrath, With this I'll break the galling chain of life: Thusâand thus only, can I truly reignâ [Stabs himself. And nowâvainâtransitory world, farewelâ Where fickle fortune bears imperial rule, And scatters favours with a partial hand: And, oh, farewel, thou poor remains of love; Thou faded mansion of my former joy:â The soft remembrance of those blissful hours, Which we so often mutually have known, Now soothes the pain of my departing soul, And serves as prelude to eternal peace. Oh! Mahomet, stretch forth thy holy hand And lead me to thy paradise above. [Dies. Sol. And what remains for wretched Solan now, Robb'd of his friend, his emperor and love; Oh, savage caitiff, by whose wicked arts, Whose bold ambition and relentless hate, The Blood of innocence hath thus been shed? Torture refin'd shall end thy trait'rous days. Bear hence the slave to some more dismal place, 'Till racks dismiss him to his future hell. Oras. What hell can equal disappointed hopes; Yet know, vain boy, I can despise thy pow'r, And rise superior on revenge's wing: I sought for vengeance on a mortal foe, But thou betray'd'st an unsuspecting friend, Let that thought sting thee, when I breathe no moreâ With this I leave thee, most ungrateful wretch; Foolish as base, and false to ev'ry cause. I own, by me Almira fell to dust, And, joy to furnish thee that source of pain. Now shew your racks to this undaunted heart; And know, while thou art torn with sharp remorse, Orasmin can the frowns of fate defy, And, 'midst your keenest torments smiling die. [Exit, guarded. Sol. Oh, harden'd insolenceâunfeeling fiend; I fear my agonies will thine exceed, Yet all too little to atone my guilt. Effen. Unhappy prince, if penitence can heal, Thy loyal efforts may afford some ease; Heav'n, in displeasure, frowning on our state, Resolv'd upon this scene of matchless woe, For secret causes, hid from human eyes: Here then, at once I'll bid all courts farewel, And bear my shatter'd trunk to some lone cell; There, in the shade of solitude, remain, And taste the blessings of a peaceful reign; King of myselfâbelow the frowns of fate, Yet far above the turbulence of state. Oh, that mankind would virtue's paths pursue, And wisely keep her precepts full in view; Then all must transitory state despise, And on the wing of true ambition rise, To taste of bliss immortal in the skies.
