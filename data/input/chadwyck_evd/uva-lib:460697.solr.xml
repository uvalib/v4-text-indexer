      <field name="fulltext">TO NEALE THOMSON, ESQ., OF CAMPHILL, GLASGOW. My dear Neale Thomson, Accept this humble, but sincere Testimony of Affection and Gratitude, from your faithful Friend and Servant, JAMES SHERIDAN KNOWLES. 29, Alfred Place, Bedford Square, London, 30th May, 1842.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. (AS ORIGINALLY PERFORMED AT THE HAYMARKET IN 1842.) The King of Arragon Mr. Howe. Alonzo, his Son, married to Olivia Mr. H. Holl. Andreas Courtier Mr. Wilsone. Carlos Courtier Mr. Worrell. Gomez Courtier Mr. Williams. Pedro, an Executioner Mr. Gough. Ruphino, a Peasant Mr. Stuart. Alasco, his Son Mr. C. Kean. Almagro Alasco's friend, in love with Olivia Mr. Phelps. Velasquez Mr. F. Vining. Cortez Mr. Caulfield. Nunez Mr. T. F. Matthews. Olivia, Ruphino's Daughter Mrs. C. Kean. Theresa, an Attendant. Officers, Jailer, Peasants, Guards, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âA Room in the Citadel. Enter Carlos and Andreas. And. The Prince not yet set out! Car. Not yet. He cleaves To home with doting on his peasant wife. His journey towards the frontier, thrice, has he, From day to day, deferr'd, already; but The King, impatient of his weak delay, Brooks it no longer. He departs at noon. And. Guess you, my lord, the motive of the King In banishing, as 'twere, at such a time, The Prince from Saragossa? Hard exchange, The bridal chamber for the warrior's tent! The murmurs and the dalliance of love, For the trump's braying and the clang of steel! Methinks, the nuptials, he so interrupts, Can scarce be to his mind! Car. 'Tis certain, sir, They are not, and no wonder. The fair Prince Had bent full low, to choose, for mate, a bride Of pure Hidalgo blood; how then, the child Of a peasantâgrant her pattern of her sex, And never match'd throughout the lengthy line Of Eve's angelic daughters? And. Such she is! A noteless maid, that from all note, howe'er Surpassing, so diverts observance, that Her perfect beauty and consorting form Bewilder rivalry itself, and turn The infidel into a worshipper! Car. Certain she has no peer; yet, not a match For the King's son. So thinks the King; and, hence, The Prince hath honourable banishment. The army needs no prince, the soldier who Commands it, prince of leaders!âDo you think The King stops here? Will he remain content With banishment of the enamour'd Prince? Will that remove the cause of banishment? The knot the Prince has tied, will that undo it? 'Tis but the opening of a drama, sir, Of which the master-action is to come! And. I trust the King, if more he meditates, Will act advisedlyâOur peasant princess, Amongst her class, ranks highest; royal pastures, For their extent and stock, her father hath,â Is more beloved than envied; hath a son Of parts that look with scorn upon his station, And fiery soul, more prompt to move than rest! The peasantry speak things that mock contentâ Complain of wasting levies, grievous impostsâ And with their thoughts our citizens chime in. The Cortez have been calmer too.âBehoves The King be wary how he acts!âA straw Has struck the sceptre from as firm a grasp, And may do so with his.âThe King is here, And, lo, the peasant princess, following, But borne along, with senses wholly lapsed. The parting must be o'er; the Prince, set out. The King enters. King. [Speaking to persons without.] Convey her to her chamber!âTend to her! Advise us, soon as to herself she comes. [Sees Andreas. Andreas return'd! Despatch, indeed, my lord! How go the levies on? And. But tardily, I grieve to say; your people lack the heart To tender duty quickly. King. Needs the spur! We know to use it! Carlos, take in charge The task, whereof we lately gave you hint, Soon as her lapsÃ©d senses are restored. Stay!âAndreas. And. My liege? King. To invest our will With greater weight, share you the charge with Carlos, To rid my palace of its forcÃ©d guest. The countenance I lent this loathÃ©d marriage, Won from my weakness by my wilful son, I now retractâirrevocably annul. The contract which, at first, we set our seal to, Enforced from us, is render'd valid by No after grace. Consent, enforced, is none! Soon as her senses from their lapse spring up, Declare to her, our mandate, she depart From Saragossa; nor return to it, On penalty of death! Apparel, gems, All gifts of lavish, ill-advisÃ©d love Are hers to keep; nor let her lack for gold. Meanwhile, my council summon. Kings must give Their actions other sanction than their own! A peasant share the throne of Arragon? Far better Arragon without a throne! [They go out severally. SCENE II. âA Cottage. In the distance a mountainous country. Enter Ruphino and Alasco. Ruph. How sayest now, Alasco? Art content? Thy overbearing pride is conqueror! His private nuptials with thy sister hath The Prince Alonzo own'd, in presence of His royal father, and convention full Of all the noble blood in Arragon; And thou, the peasant-heir unto a stool, By proclamation under royal sealâ For 'tis the same as such, as clear impliedâ Art kinsman to a race whose seats are thrones! Art now content? Alas. I am. Ruph. So am not I. It was coercing, where the will was free To do all needful right, and such had done! By the rare beauty of your sister won. And more by her rare virtue, which repell'd The approach of love, till honour came with it, Its most ingenuous voucher that 'twas such As chariest virgin, free, might entertain; The Prince at once besought her heart and hand, Assured by holy rite. Alas. The Prince was wise. He knew a virtuous woman, and the way She could alone be won; and took that way; Thereby receiving to his arms a maid Whose worth is challenger of Arragon To find another maid her moiety! Good sooth, I thank the Prince, for honestly Affecting my rare sister!âtaking care Of his health! By Our Lady, had he breathed to her, That's pure as Heaven, one wish or thought of hell, And with my cognizanceâ Ruph. Alasco, peace! Supposing wrongs to be by those committed Who never gave us ground to think they meant them, But proofs, instead, of holiest intents; Is to commit, ourselves, a grievous wrong, And surfeit virtue of its bootless deeds, That cannot earn it credit! So oft-times Uncharitableness defaulters makes Of those who, else, were solvent. Think, my son, If this were told the Prince, how it might change His aspect towards thy sister; without cloud And summer brightness now! Alas. If it were told? 'Tis told! Ruph. By whom? Alas. By me!ânor stintingly. Think you I went a-begging when I went To claim admission of my sister's rights, As loud and broad as though she had a king To father her, being a prince's wife? Ruph. I was content to know she was his wifeâ Her honour so assured, it needed not Be bruited through the realmâdisparaging To his rank! Alas. [greatly indignant]. Disparaging! Ruph. Well, boy, how now? Alas. [Recollecting himself.] You are her father, and you have a right To speak of your own child. Ruph. I hope I have. Alas. Disparaging!âThe Prince beheld her first At a tournament, among the common gazers, No state to point her out, and yet the mark Attracted every eye!âhe heard the buzz Of wonder, heralding her matchless beauty, And, far and near, the concourse summoning Before the humble seat allotted her! With but her peasant brother, for a page; With but a peasant's fillet, for a crown; With robes, no other than a peasant's tire; There sat my sister, on that common bench, Converting it into a radiant throne, Before which ribbons, stars, and coronets Press'd, thick, to stand and render homage to herâ Disparaging! Ruph. I meant to his rank! Alas. His rank? Rank's but an eminence whereon we see Sometimes a tower, sometimes a hovelâmakes, Alike conspicuous, the dignity Or meanness of the thing that's built upon it! Ruph. My son, these thoughtsâ Alas. Nay, father, hear me on! I honour rank, when he, who owns, becomes it! For, here, our stations differ from our clothesâ That these are to our measure made; those notâ Whence marvellous misfitting! Tell me not Of the Prince's rank, but tell me of his deeds; Of which I know but little, save that once He used a peasant's daughter honestlyâ That, of its grace diminish'd, when the thing He felt no shame to do, he fear'd to own! A private marriage not to be divulged Till he saw time!âI saw that time was now, And made him see it, too! Ruph. 'Twas breach of faith! Alas. No, father!âwhat I was no party to, I no observance owed. My sister's marriage Did accident, alone, reveal to me. I found that she had won the Prince's love Who well deserved a princeâhe thought she did, And married her!âIf good enough, to wed; I thought my sister good enough, to ownâ And told him so. What instances I used, And what dissuasion he, it matters not; The Prince has own'd her, and I am content; Though I had wish'd her otherwise bestow'd! Ruph. What! on Almagro? Must I tell thee, son, The thousandth time, I do not like that man; Whose God is not the one he prayeth to, But the worst idol that a man can serveâ Self!âFind the friend he does not profit by, In pride, or vanity, or avarice, And I will grant him single in his loves! Find me the friend he would not sacrifice, When profit kept not pace with cherishing; And I will show you him who made Almagro, Help'd him with brain and heart, and when in need, Was left there, for a doit. Alas. Velasquez? Ruph. Yes! Alas. Velasquez dotes! Ruph. He dotes who loves Almagro! Thou, boy! perceiv'st not he is arrogant? Whom does he not o'erbear that is too weak, From gentleness or place, to throw him off? Of all pernicious things, the very worst Is large ambition with a narrow soul. Because it strives for power which, when obtain'd, 'Tis certain to abuse. Alas. He is generous! Ruph. And you aye hear of it. Boy, there are men Who coin by charities, and he is one! Say what he gives, I'll tell you what he gets By what he gives; which makes his bounties mitesâ His modest bounties, that would shun the light They still make sure to meet! He is ungrateful! And he that is ungrateful, can't be generous! Alas. He is my friend!âI love him! he loves me! Ruph. Not thee he loves, boy, but thy properties, That much avail him in the game he plays To raise himself to popularity. For, through thy reverend uncle's loving care, Thy mind, in youth, was plough'd by diligence, And with the seeds of knowledge amply sown, That found a kindly soil! Wherein he lacks, Thou makest up to him with such a zeal, Privation makes him rich!âhis little worthâ For he has worth, as every man hath someâ Thy magnifying love heaves up for him Into a mountain!âmake it pass for suchâ That, with the crowd, he grows enormously! But he hath vanity voracious as The hunger that's diseaseâwhich, though 'tis gorged Full to the throat, cannot stop craving on! Wait till thou stint'st him there! He'll fail theeâyea, Though he could save thee from a jail or starving! Besides, he has the temper of a wolf. He has been known to use a woman roughly! Hurt her to vent his choler! Such a man To get thy sister's hand! Alas. It were bestow'd Better than on the Prince;âdisparity Of rank, in those that wed, is dangerous. In such relation there should be no debts, Save those that are reciprocal, and which Jars cannot call to mind!âWill the great Prince Forget the peasant in the Prince's wife? Will life be all one honeymoon? Believe The temper is the sweetestâpain will turn it. And that is of the body, or the mind; And sometimes is so sharp, it won't abide A comforter, but flout the care would lull it! So, for love's pains, gives love, itself, repulse; So, is its dulcet tongue harsh accents taught, The least of which breaks its entrancing spell, And wakens moods, to love, as clouds to sun! Ah then the heart of woman, when she finds The force her modest nature underwent To make allow'd surrender of her charms, Forgotten! for the host of suing wishes That won her slow consent, repugnance now, Rebuke, reproach!âher lack of wealth or state Cast into her teeth by him, who swore to her A month ago her value beggar'd kingdoms! So should it fare with my dear sister, gods! How she would blanch and freeze to find a churl In him she loved so dear, she quitted brother And father for him! I have had my humours, Which her content has paid for, for a moment; And when she has reproach'd me, lovingly, And found it only chafed me, she has weptâ But the first tear has thrown me on her neck. Would it be so with him? Ruph. 'Twould not be so With him thou lov'st,âAlmagro. Alas. No, by my troth, Because it could not beâAlmagro is Her equal. But behoves the Prince beware He sports not with her tears, or drops may fall, Lie nearer to the heart, from those he cherishes! Let him beware! If there are towns and cities In Arragon, so are there villages, Which men inhabit, by the fresh breath of heaven Nurtured, more hardily, than those who live In streets and lanes, like convicts pent in mines, Wasted with sweltering! Her first complaint Would raise a cry for vengeance that would shake His father from his throne! Ruph. Beware, my son; The man who ever runs into extremes, Nine times in ten o'erlooks both right and reason, That, mostly, lie between. This is again Almagro, who would make thee common foe; While, for himself, the greatest foe thou hast, He nourishes the friend. Boy!âBoy!âthat man Will bring thee into straits! For his own ends He heaps up discontents 'gainst all above him, To crush them with the weightânot for the hatred He bears oppression, but for envy of it! He blames the grievance he himself inflicts not; But let him have the power, you will see worse Begot of his own pride and heartlessness! I say no more, my son!âBeware of him! Where loiter'd you upon your journey home? Six weeks you have been gone; ere one was past, Your sister was proclaim'd the Prince's wife. Alas. I took a circuit home to see my friends, And tell what I had done. Ruph. You're a great man In Arragon! Alas. I number many friends! No word yet from my sister? Ruph. I expect Word by VelasquezâWho is he comes yonder? I see but dimly!âI am very oldâ Is it Velasquez? Alas. Yes, Velasquez 'tis, And looks like one who has a tale to tell.â [Velasquez enters hastilyâstops short on seeing Alasco. How now, Velasquez? Velas. Are you there, Alasco? Alas. Yes, I am hereâthe matter? Velas. Nothing! Alas. Something! Your steps were hasty,âdid you speed for nothing? Your breath is scanty,âwas it spent for nothing? Your looks imply concern,âconcern for nothing? Your road lay to my father,âseeing me, You stopp'd as bound to any other door! Was that for nothing?âAyâand now you stand Like one that's balk'd about to take a leap Which he felt sure to makeâwith bated crest, With vigour chill'd, wann'd cheek, and sparkless eye!â Do all these things mean nothing?âif they do, Then means commotion nothing! Velas. I would be Alone with your father. Alas. So I told you!âWell, You are alone with him. [Goes out. Ruph. What is't, Velasquez? Thou comest from the capital, and thence, Or I mistake, thou bringest news for me. Velas. I do; and therefore wish'd thy son away; For he is rash; and, gall'd, will take no road, Save that his fury likes. Ruph. Bring'st thou me news Would rouse the fury of my son, Velasquez? Thou mak'st me trembleâI am very old; Too old to hear bad news!âDon't tell it yetâ Yet know I what it is.âAlas! my daughter! I knew no good could come of this avowal! The Prince has used her ill!âand if he has, Let him look to it!âLet him!âThreescore years and ten, 'Gainst youth are but a straw against a staff; But, with no better, will I beard the man That wrongs my daughter!âI grow strong, Velasquez; Am waxing young again; as in my prime! Ay, as I live, I am!âI thank thee, Nature! To have left me strength!âI yet am worth a blow!â[Staggers. I reel, Velasquez,âlet me lean upon thee. Velas. The Prince has done no wrong. Ruph. Heav'n bless the Prince! And pardon me that I did wrong to him In thinking that he had!âthe gracious Prince That ever honourably loved my child! How could I think that he could do her wrong! Don't say I did so.âWhat's amiss, Velasquez? I see 'tis nothing that affects my child: Nought can go wrong, while the good Prince is near her. Velas. He is no longer near her. Ruph. No!âNot near her? My dark surmises are at work again! And yet thou say'st he has not wrong'd my child. Velas. Thy child and he are wrong'd. Ruph. We'll right them, then Who did it?âwell? Velas. The King! Ruph. How?âHow? Velas. Despatch'd The Prince to head his armies in the north, And, when his back was turn'd, convoked his council, And made them pass a formal act, declaring The marriage of thy daughter null and void! Ruph. His right to his throne is void, if he breaks through Religion and the laws that fence my child! There are men in Arragon!âAlasco!âI Have found my strength again! Alasco!âAy, I am a peasant, he is a king! Great odds! But greater have grown even!âWhy, Alasco! Enter Alasco. Alas. Here, father. Ruph. [recollecting himself at sight of his son]. OâI call'd you,âdid I? Alas. Yes. Ruph. I did it without thinkingâWell, Alasco? Alas. Well, father? You call'd me, and I know you wanted me. Speak out, and do not fear my rashness, father: Though there be cause for heat, I can be cool. How pale you are! How you are quivering, And how you gasp for breath! and your eyes look As, would you let them, they could drown your cheeks! Oh, my poor father! Ruph. Your poor sister, boy!â [Bursts into tears and falls on Alasco's neck. Alas. What of my sister?âSay, Velasquez, for My father can't, or won't. Enter Almagro, and a number of other Peasants. Alma. AlascoâNews! Alas. Ay, now I'll hear it. Ruph. Tell it you, Velasquez! Let it not come from him! He will heap fire On fire. Velas. Your sister is divorced, Alasco, By edict of the men who guard the laws. Alma. Who break the laws!âYes, the fair Prince Alonzo,â Royal Alonzo!âweary of his wifeâ Though but the waning of the honeymoon, Only the waningâhe were made of ice Could think it moreâon pretext of command From the King to lead his armiesâ'Twas contrivedâ A piece of villany at the first sight:âleft her, To cast her honourably from his bed! Ruph. Thou liest. Alma. [furiously]. Liest! Alas. Peace! Almagro!âNay, Scowl not upon my father! If you are angry, Brow me! Alma. My dear Alasco! Ruph. Dear!âhow long? The Prince did never yet a double deed! I would that I could say as much for thee! Alma. For me! [Furiously.] Alas. Again? May not an old man say What he likes? Ruph. I would all young men spoke as true! Alas. Father! your child is shamed! that horrid word Written on her brow, thou'dst wish her dead ere read there: Her!âme!âthyself!âall kith and kin thou hast! And can thy breast find room for other cause Of hate, reviling, or revenge? If it can, Mine can't. Alma. No more can mine. I have no foes Save those who wrong thy sister!ânone will have! Give me thy hand, Velasquez, and be friends. Velas. I could be friends with him bespoke me foul! I could be friends with him that gave me blow; But with the friend who fail'd me in the need He should, and could have help'd; I'll ne'er be friends. Alma. By hell! Velasquezâ[Furiously.] Alas. Do you rage again? Or did I dream you do? Friends! if not friends Among yourselves, waive jars awhile for me! Who is a caitiff, be it not the man Laws civil and religious cannot bind? Or what are prayers, if holy rites are threads, And those they bind, asunder cut, at will? Or what is Heaven, if of no more esteem Than what 'tis witness to, to be pronounced A fraud and nullity? 'Tis sacrilege If from the altar one abstract a mite, And the offender dies; yet, by my troth, It may be want that did the deed, not he, And hunger breaks, they say, through walls of stone! But what prompts him who mocks the altar, friends? Pays to the compact 'tis appliance to No grain of the respect he entertains For bargains struck by hands 'cross market tables? What, if not hell?âWhat should be done to such, Ay, say he wore a crown? Alma. He should be stripp'd on't,â Caged in a mineâyea, mulcted to the cost Of his life! Ruph. O noânoâno! He should be made To render back their rights to those from whom He wrested themâno more. That's justice, sir; The rest is vengeance, which belongs to Heaven, Not sinful things like men! Alas. We'll master him, Then deal with him. Ruph. My son, you will not then Be masters of yourselves! Alas. No fear of us! Come!âTo the villages! and every man Call out his friends, and bring them where we'll meet In one o'erwhelming mass! Peasants. Where? Alas. Let's consult! [Retires a little with Almagro and the rest. Ruph. Backâback, Velasquez, as thou lovest me! Back to the capital! find out my child!â Apprize her of what's coming! She may need To be upon her guard. I'll do as much For thee. Meanwhile, I'll get me ready, friend, And follow thee with all the speed I can. [Velasquez goes out. Oh, how I shake!âStorms do not for old treesâ Time was I thought them puffs. I then was young! Alas. and Alma. At the Cross! [The rest echo them, exclaiming, âAt the Cross!â Alma. Now for redress of common grievancesâ Burdens should not be borneâWe'll cast them off! Peasants. We will! Alma. One signal wrong does better than Tocsins, my friends, to call bold men to arms! Peasants. To arms! Ruph. Hear me, my boy!âAlasco! O, my son!â Alas. I am thy son, and for that very reason I will not hear thee, while my sister suffers An injury and a shame.âTo arms! to arms! [All except Ruphino rush out, crying, âTo arms! to arms!â Ruphino totters into the Cottage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âIn the Citadel. Enter the King and Andreas. King. What! not the jewels that he gave her? And. No; Though o'er and o'er assured, in taking them, She did your highness' will. Her wedding-ring Was all she kept. King. No murmurs? No complaints? And. None; but, instead, prayers for your highness' health, And length of prosperous life! King. She would be thought A martyr! She has heard how such have suffer'd, Blessing their persecutors; and pretends To imitate them! 'Tis the way to make Misfortunes profit usâespecially With the meanâto whom the pang still brings the wail. It moves their wonder, and they worship that They wonder at! I warrant you she won, With patient aspect, and undrooping mien, More hearts to pity her, as she went forth, Than tears and wringing of the hands had done! And. She went not forth by the chief portal, but A private one, and thereby shunn'd the crowd, That fill'd the street with ferment. King. By your care, Or by her own? And. Her own, my gracious liege. King. 'Twas much forbearance; but the girl is shrewd; She knows unlikely things may come to pass; The hardest heart may melt; my mind may change To bind more fast, what now I have unbound; Whereto she takes good heed no hindrance come, Through lack of patience, now! She is very wise! Her beauty, past compare, must all allow. Can she be blind to what all others see? And can she see it, without prizing it? The homeliest maid, I ever met with, thought More of herself than she would seem to do. She is very wise!âAught said she of the Prince? And. No, not a word; but paused before she went, Gazing upon his portrait strainingly. I think, but am not sure, at first she wept, For past her eyes her kerchief once she drew; 'Twas then put up, and, to her other hand, The hand that held it, join'd in fervent clasp; And thus she stood, the spirit, as I thought, Of very prayer, itself, personified; For o'er her face the cast which masters give, To paint the act of beatific trance, Spread, flooding it with light! whate'er she thought, The words were in her heart.âShe breathed no sound Till she had made an end; as I inferr'd From a deep sigh she drew; whereon she turn'd With aspect heavenly calm, as worshippers, That rise refresh'd, from the renewing altar. King. You speak this heartily! And. I speak the truth! King. You say the Cortez, in last night's debate, Made question of my faculty to break This most pernicious marriage? And. Many spoke To that effect,âmade it a pretext for Rehearsal of old grievances. King. What they Call grievances!âWas there much heat? And. There was: But that within doors, cool to that without, Where up and down the streets the people ran, Women and men, but women frequentest, Crying to one another, as they pass'd, âThe Rose of Arragon!âââFall Arragon Ere she be trampled on!âââNo Rose, no King!â King. Suspect you danger? And. Yes, when discontents Draw women out of doors, revolt is strong. King. The garrison is under arms? And. It is, And, every quarter of an hour, patrols Are sent into the town, to go the rounds, And keep in check disorder, by the show Of preparation and alacrity! King. You have not yet gone forth? And. Not yet, my liege; I wait for Carlos, to report the state And prospect of affairs. It is his hourâ And he at hand as soon. King. Well, Carlos? Enter Carlos. Car. All Was quiet through the night; and, as the night, I would aver the day were like to pass, But for unwonted calm. An hour, or more, 'Tis past the time the shopkeeper should opeâ And he is up, but bides with shutters closed; The craft of the artificer stands still, And yet he is awake since break of dayâ The cries are silent on the crowdless streets; The very churls, whose meals on errands wait, Stand not upon the watch for customers, And breakfast-time at hand! 'Tis market-dayâ And to the gates no troops of peasants come, With garden-viands, flocks, or herds, or aught Within the list of rustic merchandise. None is at work, save the tired sentinel Who paces, out and back, his beat; on watch 'Gainst dangers yet unseen. King. It cannot be! Car. What cannot be, my liege? King. That they design Revolt! And. There's eight o'clock. King. Hark, sirs!âThe town Is all at once astir! What is't?âLook out! Car. Their houses, one and all the citizens Have left, and throng the streets;âtheir cloaks are on, Close-folded on their breasts; they move one way, As on one common object bent! King. Descend: Wait till your eye on some acquaintance falls, Then call and question him. Go both of youâ [Exeunt Carlos and Andreas. What is't to be a king?âTo govern?âAy! With such observance as the pilot meets, Who thinks to rule the sea! not more perverse, Than moody ever-changing subjects are! Rejoicing in his helm, he ploughs along! Leagues fleet like miles beneath his flying keel! Before its time his port begins to loom!â When takes him, right ahead, all unawares, A furious shift of wind; which, if he 'scapes From foundering, blows him, from his jocund course A thousand miles away!âSo with a king! A month ago the war was popular; My people's wishes with my army blew, Which from the gates of Saragossa march'd 'Mid shouts that would have made their cannon mute, Suppose 'twere set to roar.âI was a god! Knees bent to me as I retraced my steps, Returning to my palace! All at once The humour changed. From end to end the realm Became one caldron, ready to boil o'er With discontents! A little more of heat Was wanted onlyâthat is now supplied! The meanest sire in Arragon, suppose His son, like mine, offended, would be free To cast his bride and him to beggary! But I must needs forbear, becauseâa king!â Enter Carlos. Your tidings, Carlos? Car. In our power we hold The cause, if not the head of the revolt, That boldly now breaks forth!âWithin the gates, Acting in concert, as 'tis shrewdly guess'd, With the malcontents,âthe Rose of Arragon, Attended by a peasant, new alighted, With steed, nigh spent, as through unwonted hasteâ Has been surprised, made captive of, and now Attends with those who guard her. King. Did we straight Decree her death, who could arraign our justice? On pain of death, did we forbid return; On her account defection menaces Our throne, our life; and she, the cause, defies Our warning and our wrath! To durance with her! Olivia [without]. The King! the King! As you are loyal men, Bring me before him! King. Is't to me she comes? Let her approach. Olivia. I must and will pass in! [Rushes in and sinks exhausted before the King, Velasquez following. Forgive, my liege, the limbs that can't command The homage they have all the heart to pay; And helpless throw themselves along the ground, Instead of kneeling there. King. How happens this? Girl, I could rail, but thy pale cheek disarms me! What! art thou scared to see the conflagration Which thou, thyself, hast raised? Or hast return'd To Saragossa, whence I banish'd thee, To fan the discontent that takes thy part; And, now thou art detected, makest pretence On my account thou art here? Olivia. I could not play, My liege, a double part! I know not how! On your account alone I brave your frown; Which, though it held the lightning's power to blast, Should not prevent me, for thy health and life, To crawl to thee! to clasp thy knees! and, with A heart as full of love as loyalty, To warn thee of thy danger! King. Loyalty! And love!âWhat love? Olivia. O can you not conceive Love may be cherish'd, for another's sake, Towards those who pay us back no grain of loveâ Nay, pay us hate instead?â'Tis true, my liege! Indeed, indeed! 'tis true!âMy heart's dear lord You have taken from me!â'Cross the contract which Gave him to me, drawn pen!âtorn off the seal!â Stripp'd me to the skin, as 'twere, and cast me forth!â Yet, could my life this moment stead you,âstand In the place of yours, and yours were forfeited, Assuring yours to youâso tender is The love I bear you, for my dear lord's sake,â I would not look at it, ere I would lay it down! King. What wouldst thou gain by such a sacrifice? Olivia. Content of mine own heart!âand having that, I would bless Heaven and die. King. This is romance, Whose forms are of the brain!âbut, look for them In act, you find them not; no more than shadows Which mock the hand, would grasp them. Olivia. Take a proof! King. Ay, canst thou give me one? Olivia. I come not back Rebelliously to Saragossa, whence I went with but obedience in my heart. If you except my love for my dear lordâ I had no thought, save of the arms I had left; And those, my father's, I was going to. King. What made thee then return? Olivia. My fears for thee! Roused by the danger thou'rt environ'd with. King. How couldst thou see the thing that was behind thee; That had not broken forth, till thou wast gone? Olivia. I speak, my liege, of fears that were before me, With word of which, this friend prevented me, Instructed by my father!âArragon, As well as Saragossa, is in arms; Taking advantage of the distant war Which leaves your kingdom weak.âNot your throne only, Your life is threaten'd; so, did I return Against thy will, to warn thee for thy safety, To urge thee to consult it; which to do, Flight must embrace this moment!âwouldst thou fly, To fly along with theeâthy hostage only!â And wouldst thou not, to die along with thee! King. What proof have I of this? Olivia. That I am here! What! dear my liege, won't you believe me still? A simple villager had ta'en my word! Who would be great, when greatness breeds mistrust! My liege!âMy liege!âI am no courtier's child; My father ne'er had need to hide his heart, So ne'er had thought to teach me to hide mine; And though I have heard men speak and think diverse, The act I never yet could comprehend; But, when their lips were open'd, listen'd still, To hear their hearts!âWhat cause should bring me back Except your health?âyour safety?âOh, my liege! Is it the roof whence, banishing my lord, You banish'd me enough? is it the bed Whence you divorced me, not content with that? Is it the face which, when I saw it last, Transfix'd me with a look that wish'd me dead, And almost struck me so?âWhat were the words Of him who spoke your will to me?ââOn pain âOf death never to see this palace more!â I see it!âI incur the penalty! My life is forfeit!âTake it!âSave thy own! The only end that brought me back again! King. I must believe her;âyet can I believe Deeds worthy richest blood, can live without?â Incredible!âYet true!âWell, Carlos,âwell?â Enter Carlos. Hast met with those, can tell thee what's afoot? Car. No, my good liege, save by surmises. King. Well; And what surmise your friends? Car. Some outbreak of The citizens! But we can master them. King. Yes, we can master Saragossa!âbut There is fear of Arragon. Enter Gomez. Gomez. The citizens And troops contend to hold the city gates, Which now the peasantry beset in throngs, As on some festal day, but not with looks Pertaining to a feast. Olivia. Sirs! if you are men, Persuade the King to flyânot Saragossa, But Arragon, on treason is intent! And, thereunto, moves hither all its power, With threats pernicious to the life of the King. Velas. Fly! fly, my liege! Gomez. The subterranean vault That, from the castle, leads without the walls, Wide from the quarter whence this tempest breaksâ That gain'd, you are safe! And. The soldiery give way! [From window. King. I will not fly!âGirl, you have told me truth! Consult your safety,âjoin your friends,âleave me! Olivia. I will not quit your side,âI have a brother, Will hear his sister's voice; friends, that will hear it. Whate'er betide, my life I link with yours! Both shall survive, or both one ruin share! King. Girl, are you flesh and blood? Olivia. No, but a rock! Stand back! [Meeting Almagro, and others entering. Alma. The King himself!âThis crowns our work, Our expedition in his death complete.â Upon him! Olivia. Hold! he is my prisoner! And I have guaranteed his life!âTake mine If you choose, Almagro.âIf you don't, spare his, Or you shall take my life.âWell were it said The Rose of Arragon kept not her word; When every Spanish woman, who deserves To bear her father's name, respects her pledge! These are my friends, Almagro, more than yours! They are my brother's friends yet more than mine! They have mothers, sisters, loves, or wives, Almagro! They will respect my bidding for their sakes. Alma. For your sake come I hither. Olivia. And I thank you. And, for the good you mean me, will not shame you; Nor, countrymen and friends, will I shame you, And leave it to your enemies to say, While you stood by, I broke a Spaniard's word! Alma. Suffer ye, friends, a woman thus to thwart you? Olivia. Almagro, who is with you?âwho is leader? Alma. Your brother. Olivia. Wait his orders, then! Alma. I do them! Olivia. No, on my honour!âby his father's honour!â His own! He seeks but justice from the King, No drop of the King's blood! He loves his sister, But yet he is the subject of the King! He is a patriotâno regicide! Alma. Friends, do you halt half-way? Why come ye hither? Why are your swords in your hands? You are standing here?â There stands the King, and lives! Cortez and Nunez. He should not live! Alma. Who seconds me? [Going to advance.] [Olivia throws herself upon the King. Olivia. Come on, then, if you will; My word, you hear, is pledged to save the King! Either respect my pledge, or see me die! Around the King's life thus do I wind my own; If not a safeguard, then a sacrifice! Alas. [without]. Olivia! Olivia. Here, Alasco!âSpeed, my brother! HereâHere!âHe comes! Now to touch the King who dares? Alasco rushes in, followed by others. Alas. My sister! Olivia. Ay, my brother! Alas. How! the King! [Uncovering. King. Your sovereign, sir!âAre you a subject, or A traitor? If a traitor, in his blood Consummate what you have begun,âwhereto He lends you his own sword! [Throws down his sword, scornfully. Sirs, sheathe your blades! With loyal hearts like yours The King commands, as long as the King lives! In strife like thisânot strife but butcheryâ You shall not stain your blades! Alas. My liege, except What's shed without, no blood shall flow to-day. Sheathe your swords, comrades, Saragossa's won! To custody the King will condescend To render up his person. You, Velasquez, Will in safe wardship see the King bestow'd. Your heads uncover'd, sirs!â'tis Majesty, Though it be fallen in fortunesâ [The King and others retire, guarded by Velasquez and Peasantsâall uncover as he goes off. Come, Olivia, Sister, you are no offcast now:âSit there: [Takes her to the throne, and places her upon it. You are the Prince's wife. Till he comes back And owns her such, the King allowing it, And to our grievances giving full redress, Who should be Regent, brothers?âwho if not The Rose of Arragon!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âA Street in Saragossa. Enter Ruphino and Velasquez. Ruph. The people meet to-day! Who summon'd them? Velas. That have I yet to learn. No proclamation, Notice, affix'd on the accustom'd quarters, Calls them together; yet from mouth to mouth The rumour runs, they meet. Ruph. No whisper who Convokes them? Velas. Some say one, and some another; But still, with one and all, alike conjecture. Ruph. Knows this Alasco? Velas. Him I have not seen. Ruph. Alasco loses ground. He is nobody! Cortez and Nunez, who were yesterday Alasco's hinds, to-day are better men, Rated as the things for which they pass themselves. We can tell gold, not men! The coin that's spurious Won't pass with one in twenty!âout of twenty Take one, you scarcely the proportion leave, Who, for the sterling man, will take the base! Opinion lords it! Let but the cheat keep close, Take heed the wash conceals the brass or lead, The stamp and colour carry it!âWe ring gold; We do not so with men, but trust report, Or sight; and hence the coiner swamps the mint! So where base metal stops, the counterfeit Of human nature passes! Velas. Bitter truths! There is Almagro! nothing is too high For his o'er-reaching insolence, which his craft Passes for the aspiring of desert! Whereto he gathers those around him, whom Display and luxury corruptâwho leave His board high flush'd, to publish, in his praise, The flatteries he himself suggests to them. This will not yet thy son, Alasco, see, Who, in his singleness of nature, hugs A foe, the very worst the man can cope with Who deals with such a partner as Almagro! Take you Alasco, any day in the year, He is the same!âno change of bearing waits On change of circumstanceâhis station mounts, Not he!âHis peasant's dress he still keeps on, Though arbiter of the fate of Arragon! This balks; and all at fault we find the crowd, Who still the flimsy shows of things affect More than the things themselves; while, by a course Diverse, Almagro gathers hosts of friends! Behoves that man be watch'd! Ruph. Here comes Almagro, Cortez and Nunez too!âMy heart forebodes Some mischief is afoot! You will attend This meeting, will you not? Velas. Be sure I shall. The hour draws nigh. Ruph. I shall attend it too, Though somewhat frail to thread the jostling mass. Observe, my friendâso deep are they in converse, They note us not! They are plotting, my Velasquez! [They go out. Enter Almagro, Cortez, and Nunez. Alma. The man who takes the lead in troublous times, Would need a certain toughness of the heart, To withstand the dint of Pity,ânot give way At her instances, which ever thwart the course Of just severity. Now such a man, Methinks, Alasco is not;âa good man! A perfect man in the gentler elements Wherein our nature's founded; but without Those sterner ones, which render action safe, To those therein committed. Cortez. You are right; He is too good! Alma. A man may be too good! 'Twas fit the King should die! Strong measures suit Bold enterpises!âsteps that startle men!â Deeds that commit the actors thoroughly!â Which defy halting; far more, turning back; That fear itself takes risk for counsellor, And, in the track of doing, bustles on! For though one end combineth many minds, Yet, of those many, fewâperhaps but oneâ Can calculate the means unto that endâ The road to it, which ever is to make; Which some like straight, and others roundabout; Which some would travel wet, and others dry; Which some would take by day, and some by night; Which some would trudge, and others roll along! Thus, if all go together, one must lead; That all go safe, he must know how to lead; He must be brains, and heart, and limbs for all! I fear Alasco scarce is such a man. Nunez. 'Tis clear he is not. Cortez. See what he has done! Spared the King's life, wherein our grievance lay! Alma. Wherein our peril lies, not only that Our grievance may return with fourfold weight, But heavy penalty be undergone For the free breath that we have dared to draw! Cortez. Talk you of penalty? Alma. Of penalty! For see our plight:âthe power we have unseated Is old in stratagemâhas stuck at nought To keep the upper hand:âis perfected In subtlety to undermine the heart, And make the conscience crumble till its scruples Are swallow'd quick as water is by sand! The King 's a prisoner!âwhat then? A cage Lets out as well as in!âno fool but knows There are more keys than one to every door, And failing keys, picklocks and sledges work! And what are guards, but watchers that must be watch'd! While those who watch them may be bad as they, And need their watchers too!âNought that partakes Of flesh and blood is all dependable! âLast life, live hope.ââAy, while there runs a spark Among the embers!âThere's no bondage, then, That's end of hope, but death, with which life ends! While the King lives, there's hope for tyranny, And peradventure, there's despair for us! Nunez. If he escapes, we are lost. Alma. Not all of us. Alasco is not lost, who spared the King! Were I a man who saw with other eyes Than those of partial love, thus might I sayâ âWell done, Alasco!âhow the fair world goes! âHonesty has no chance in it!âmakes a noose âFor its own neck, e'en of the selfsame springe âThat knavery poaches with!ââI'd slay the man That call'd Alasco knave!âyet thus a man Who loved him not might sayââA day ago âAlasco was a traitor like myself, âLike you, and every one of us!âhis neck âWas debtor to the noose!âbut mark,âthe death âOf the King, which he along with us conspired, âAnd which proposing only, we have pawn'd âOur lives and all to fortune, by a cast âTo be redeem'd or lost; he makes assurance âOf safety, enrich'd by such prosperity, âAs of his tallest hopes, a month ago âMakes pigmies now!âsaves the King's life!âGood sooth, âSome men see far,âcan calculate most shrewdly âThe course of consequences!âI had studied âAn hour, or more, methinks, ere I had seen âThe way to the King's favour was to put âHis life in jeopardy.ââYou know I speak Not as myself, but as another man! I love Alasco, and, with care for him, I contemplate his acts with others' eyesâ Or rather strive to do soâmuch I fear, In their regards, his mercy to the King Seems favour to himself. Nunez. And yet he keeps The King in durance! Alma. True. Nunez. How thereupon Shall he acquit himself to the King? Alma. How? Nunez. Yes. Alma. By laying it to our charge; to which, no doubt, He to the King sets down his threaten'd life!â Heard'st what one said to me, when that I urged Which you urge nowâa shrewd, far-sighted man? Cortez. What did he say? Alma. âAlasco spares the King, âThereby incensing us, too chafed thereat âTo brook the further stepâsetting the King âAt liberty!ââDo you see?ââOn our account âHe keeps the King in duranceâfor himself, âHe would set him free to-morrow!ââDo you see? âHe makes his sister Regent,âWhat is she? âThe wife of the Prince, the King's son!âVery well! âWhere is the Prince?âon the frontier with the army. âWhere will he be a month hence, when he learns âThe state of Saragossa?âAt her gates, âWith other knocks than beggars give for alms âBesieging them; which we would treat like beggars!â âBut worse than thousand foes without the camp, âIs one that lurks within it!âHe gains entrance!â âHe sets his father on the throne again, âHis wife ascended but to render up;â âAlasco is the brother of his wife; âAlasco, the preserver of the King; âAlasco of his treason is assoil'd; âHis fault transmuted into his desert; âHis sister, royal consort for his sake; âHimself adopted, cherish'd, help'd to climb; âWhile we, his instruments, which when he used âHe cast aside, obtain for our deserts âThe dungeon, or the galleys, or the scaffold.â Now do you see? Cortez. How well you argue it! Alma. I, my dear friend!âI only tell you what Another saidâI did not argue so. How could I, loving good Alasco?âLove With all mankind is blindness, more or less! Cortez. Would we had made you Regent!â Alma. Had you done so, Thus far at least you had been safeâyour ends Had been my own! Nunez. And why not Regent now? Cortez. The law is now the people's willâthe people To-day assembleâNunez, you and I Repair to the place of meeting, and at once Propose Almagro Regent! Alma. [Affecting surprise.] Do the people Assemble to-day? Cortez. They do. Alma. You much surprise me! And wherefore, friends? Nunez. Sure you forget, to ask! Alma. Do I?âI must, when you assert I do! Nunez. Recall, good sir, what yesternight you saidâ âBehoved the people meet more frequently; âAs none could tell the day, or hour, their voices âMight save the liberties of Arragon.â Alma. Something to that effect I now recall. Cortez. To that effect we lost no time, but set Your friends at once to work; who so contrived, The people act as of their own accord, Nor know the springs that move them. Alma. Admirable! A master-stroke, indeed, of policy! Cortez. Come, Nunez, come! Almagro shall be Regent! [Exeunt Cortez and Nunez. Alma. Gods, what a giant is the mass, in act! In reason, what a child!âI shall be Regent! They think Alasco traitor! Honesty, Thou know'st thy thanks! Sweat on!âAlasco is honest; Means all men fairly, as he means himself; Is true to the cause; would fetter his own limbs, To give immunity to the meanest man's That has embraced it;âyet is he a traitor! Why so should all men fare who think they live But for the world, and not the world for them. I am Alasco's friend!âYes, on the terms I have been a friend to many another man, To friend myself!âApart from that, Alasco Is such a man as jars my nature mostâ A trusting lover of the common race; Looks to another's good before his own; Never suspects that men may cheat, betray; Much less that they might swear themselves his friends, And cut his throat, as I, almost could do, But for this cause, had I no other reason, That people say, and not his friends alone, I have fatten'd on his credit!âfor the tax My pride has paid him thereâhe shall pay galling! Yet will I keep awhile the mask on, for The passion that consumes me, drinks my blood up, And prompts defiance both of earth and heaven To compass the possession of his sister! He is at hand!ânow to receive my friendâ Welcome, Alasco! Alasco enters. Alas. Welcome every hour That brings me to my friend! Alma. [with over-acted energy.] I am thy friend. Alas. It were believed without that emphasis! Is anything wrong? Require I now a friend More than at any other time? Alma. O no! Alas. Almagro, more is written on thy brow Than thou think'st meet to trust thy tongue withal! That smile 's too thin! I can see through it, man! It comes from the head, and not the heart; the which 'Tis meant to hide, not show! Alma. Doubt'st thou my truth? Alas. Ayâthou'rt in earnest now! In honest earnest! Thou think'st, indeed, I do!âMy own Almagro, I am too clear myself, to doubt thy truth, Or any other man's, unless, indeed, Upon most cogent reason. Listen to me! There are not wanting those who love me well, Whom I love well, that have essay'd to shake My faith in thee. When saw'st thou it was shaken? Have I not still return'd to thee, my friend, With open face and heart? Thou hast borne me hardâ Too hard, in sooth, to justify endurance In any but a brotherâtill I have felt My tingling fingers coiling in my palm!â O had I struck thee then!âbut, at the thought Of blow to thee, I could have struck myself; And never parted we at such a time, But I have held to thee my open palm As frank as now I do! Alma. [with an effort]. As frank I take it. Alas. What is the matter, man? I do not feel The pressure of your hand as I was wont; Ay, there it is! but comes upon the hint. It used to come without! Man! you are thinking Of something else than me! or else of me, In other mood than you were wont to think. Have I done anything? Alma. No. Alas. No? that's right. What is it, then? Alma. What? Alas. WhatâCome! Come! You know There's something. What is it? Alma. There is no satisfying The people! Alas. Now 'tis coming! Well?âgo on! Alma. They are jealous of you. Alas. Jealous, are they?âwhy? Alma. Because you spared the King. Alas. I never thought To harm the King. Alma. No? Alas. No! Alma. I thought you did! Alas. You thought I did?âwhat! take his life, and he In our power?âLose my own first!âWhile he was free, While he was able to dispute with us, His power to oppress, and ours to right ourselves; The argument, indeed, was life or death! That's over!âat an end!âTake the King's life? I'd slay the man that talk'd of touching it! Alma. What did you then propose? Alas. What I set out with! Assurance of my sister's nuptial rights, And full redress of the people's grievances. Alma. Which you will get! [Ironically.] Alas. Will get?âBe sure, I will! Alma. Our friends believe they had been perfected In the King's death. Alas. Our friends believe like fools! I'll not say, knaves.âIs not the King our hostage? Where lies his value? Is it in his life, Or, in his body, only?âWhile his friends Believe they risk his life, to strike at ours, Will they be quick to come to blows!âor rather Will they not seek a parley?âtreat with us?â Listen to our terms?âaward them their due weight? Grant them?âupon the Gospels ratify A treaty with us, sworn to by the King himself? Take the King's life! Alma. Would I had thought of this An hour ago! Alas. Why? Alma. I had been prepared To justify you to the people. Alas. Pshaw! I'll justify myself. Alma. I know him not, He is positive when into action prick'd. I have err'd in rating him too much a child, And over-reach'd myselfâI must recover, With the hold I have upon his love for me. Alasco! Alas. Well! Alma. Methinks was never pair So link'd in love as we are! We should have been Brothers! Alas. And we are so!âare we not? The worth of birth is but the right to love. We love as well as brothers, do we not, Without that right?âwhat are we then, but brothers? Come you to flesh and blood?âas all mankind Had but one parentage, in the great first, All flesh and blood are one! Alma. Yet there's a nearness In affinity. Alas. Marry, yes,âfor cuffs as well As huggings!âBrothers have been haters!âFrom One womb spring many natures, as diverse As the winds, the children of the common air! Alma. Alasco, once you wish'd I were your brother, By such a tie, as would have yet enrich'd Our ample stock of love. Alas. I did. Alma. The Prince, Thwarting my hopes, scarce ran, methinks, with thine, Or I deceive myself. Alas. You are not deceived, And know itâWherefore make a doubt of it? Alma. Our surest wishes sometimes make them doubts, Through wantonness to reassure themselves! I should have been the husband of Olivia! Alas. You should!âyou had been, had my will been done. Alma. I know your power was beggar to your will, Whose vast abundance mock'd its penury! Now haply turn'd to riches!âFriendship is A godlike thing! Alas. 'Tis perfect in itself! So has the start of love, that's not content Without its guerdon rich; to purchase which, Crowns have been lost, and what surpasses them, The grace of which they are but symbolical! Whence blossoms richer than the garden's prime, Supposing e'en the Hesperian fable truth, Have broke their golden promise, and for fruit, Given all their glorious hues to nourish poison! But friendship, save its mood, seeks no delight: Therein it all rejoices!âtemperateâ Without the fiery throbbings of the brain, And beatings of the heart!âunjealous!âpleased To gather hearts for those it cherishes, And of its own, making a goodly field, Where nothing springs, but healthy generous seed, Fair thoughts, pure feelings, sentiments sublime, To justify and grace its loved election! Alma. Friends have done miracles for those they loved. Alas. They have!âI wonder, my Almagro, what I would not do for thee? Alma. There was a thing You might have done, and did not. Alas. What was it? Alma. You knew I loved! Alas. I did, and help'd your love, Far as I could. Alma. Not so, Alasco! Alas. No? Alma. You urged my suit, indeed, but not methinks With all that sturdy earnestness you owed me; Gavest way, to soon, to a girl's fantasy, And an old man's inclining! Alas. Did I? Alma. Yes. Alas. I am sorry you should think so! Alma. I am sorry I should have cause to think so.âLook, Alasco: Had I a sister, by a friend beloved, Her wishes should incline the way I chose, Howe'er they strain'd diversely! Alas. Ay!âindeed? I think you are wrong!âA woman in affection Is steadfastness, or steadfastness is nothing. And they are fools who seek it. Alma. They are fools Who in the heart of very weakness, think To find so stern a thing. Alas. Almagro! Alma. Nay, I know I speak harsh truths to you; and yet, Did I speak harsher, I'm your fastest friend! Where was your sister's love for you, Alasco, When she repell'd the suit you urged for me? Sisters love brothers, don't they? Alas. Yes. Alma. Methinks Behoves such love be steadfast. Alas. Certainly. Alma. You pleaded for your friend with all your heart. Alas. With all my heart and soul, Almagro. Alma. Nay, I'm sure you didâI am content you didâ But had been more so, with the proof of it. Alas. What proof would you have? Alma. What proof would I have?âSuccess! The only solid proof of earnestness! Alas. Almagro!â Alma. Yes, I knowâyour sister's heart Was given to the PrinceâThat's past and gone, Alasco! The heyday of their love is over, now! From her deserted bed she now looks back Upon the day he knelt to woo her thither, Who leaves her now alone there! Alas. Well, Almagro? Alma. Thy sister is divorced. Alas. They say she is. Alma. What hinders her to be Almagro's wife? Alas. Heav'n!âher own heart!âher father's honour!âmine!â Don't touch me there, Almagro! Alma. Touch thee there! Who touch'd thee there?âIf she's divorced, she's free. Alas. If she's divorced against her husband's will, If she's divorced without her own default, If she's divorced and yet the contract goodâ Perfect, without a flaw, that made her a wife; She is not free, Almagro!âShe should die Before she married thee!âWhat would you call My sister?âWhat was she?âThe paramour Of the Prince?âWhat! mean you she was that, the which Did any call her, he would put his tongue In jeopardy; for by this honest hand I would tear it from his throat!âHave a care, Almagro! Men tell me thou art selfish!âand thou camest Too near a proof just now, in thine own aims, To overlook the honour of thy friend! Almagro, I'm a child, but yet a man! Let me not find thee, what men say thou artâ Assured of that I would hate theeâI, Almagro!â That never look'd upon my fellow-flesh Without a kindness and a care for it! Alma. I know it is thy nature. [Changing his tone. Alas. I have bragg'd; But if I have, I have said the simple truth, And, after all, where is the boast?âAt best, We are but what Heav'n made us! By no thought Or labour of my own, I love my race, Confide in them, and would do good to them! It is the bias of my natureâwhich Slept in my cradle, in the schoolroom waked, And, all throughout my manhood, has held swayâ To joy in others' thriving!âWhen deservedâ Mark that!âI would not have pretension thrive When not borne out by meritâ'Tis as bad As that a lie should prosper!âBarring that, I fare the best when I see others banquet; Nor care to scramble for the upper seats At fortune's tableâI have given them up, More oft, than I have ta'en them;ânor can I bear, Except in the sheer lack of worthiness, To turn my back on men who have their faults, Because, who has them not?âI am sure not I!â One kind of man alone I cannot brookâ The man whose God is self!âBut one such man, I bless Heaven fervently, I have ever known! And as fervently I pray to it, I ne'er may know another!âLet this passâ You say the people are displeased with me Touching the King. Is that all? Alma. Something moreâ Affecting your fair sister. Alas. What can it be? Think you I err'd to make my sister Regent? Alma. Some soreness thereupon. Alas. I thought it right; But if our friends think otherwise, 'tis well! I care not who is Regent, so the course Of things holds on. Alma. I am glad you are of that mind. They meditate a change. Alas. A change?âindeed! Alma. And steps are taken to assemble them, And learn their will and pleasure. Alas. Steps are taken? Why was not I consulted? Alma. You are too easy, Too lax in the exacting of your rights! Men take advantage of you!âto say truth, I ne'er divined you cared to be consulted, Else had I put a clog upon their speed, Had check'd its downhill swiftness. Alas. I'm not pleasedâ And yet the people could not mean me wrong. Come, come, all's well! Enter Velasquez, Cortez, and Nunez, with People. Velas. Well met, Alasco! Cortez. Andâ Well met, Almagro.âWe have an errand, sirs, To both of you. The people are dividedâ Half wish Almagro Regent, half Alasco; All holding the same mind in this regard, That, in the strait we stand in, it is fit That one of you should hold the rule, and not Alasco's sister. Which of you will give His vote to place the other in her seat? Velas. What do you say, Almagro? Alma. Good Velasquez, I am taken by surprise. Alas. And so am I; But I can speak at onceâAlmagro Regent! All. Almagro Regent! Ruphino rushes in. Ruph. No, no, no!âAlasco, What have you done? I follow'd hither, fast As my old limbs could bear meâbut too late! O son!âsonâson! thy father's voice ascends Against thy mad devotion to that man! Whom now thy breath hath seated in command, But to unseat, ere long, will call for blood! O that in even balance should be held The claims of virtue and depravity; Of truth and falsehood; generosity; And overweening heartless selfishness; That the weak, good, in its simplicity, Should cast its weight into the other scale, And heave its own to the beam!âFriendsâcountrymenâ Undo what you have done! Alas. It is too late. Ruph. Still faithful 'gainst thyself! Alma. Ruphino!âSir!â As to your years, with which your worth has grown, Behoves me pay all reverenceâobserve The first use which I make of that same power Which you begrudge me hold. If mine, at home, Supreme command; Alasco, rule abroad; And, next to thee, Velasquez; whom, the more He is bent to be my foe, the more will I E'en as a friend entreat. Nunez. 'Tis nobly said! Alma. Away, Alasco! join the patriot host, And take Velasquez with thee;âthou, the chief; He, second in command.âMy friend, embrace. How say you, sir? Am I a man for thee Or him to fear?âHealth and success, my friend! You, to bright gains; honours, and spoils of war! I, to the care and drudgery of the state! [Goes out, followed by the people, shouting. Ruph. This day, my son, we both shall recollect. Velas. Alasco, come. Ruph. Till evening wait, Velasquez. Methinks you have forgot your sister, boy: If not to take farewell, a word or two Behoves you change with her before you go. His sister would have speech with him, Velasquez! Alas. Husband your speed, Velasquez, till I join you. Velas. Nay, we shall start together; say an hour Ere sunset. At the postern with your steed An hour ere sunset shall you find me waiting. Not till you join me shall I sally forth, But wait for you at the postern with your steed. [Velasquez goes out. Ruph. What ponder you, Alasco? Alas. Nothing. Ruph. Son! You are not ill? Alas. No, no! Lead to my sister. [They go out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. âThe Corridor of the Dungeons. Enter Almagro and Pedro. Alma. So this is thy domain?âa gloomy one! When, yesterday, I ranged the prison-cells, I little dream'd to find their custody Committed to an old acquaintance. As I told thee then, that old acquaintance may Become my friend; and, if my friend, a rich, Promoted one! Thou saw'st me, yesterday, The same Almagro whom thou knew'st before, Except the lead I took in this revolt, And that, but second to Alasco. Now Alasco gives me place; this hour, good Pedro, Has placed me in the seat his sister fill'd! Almagro rules in Saragossa now, Almagro now is Regent. When we discoursedâ Anticipating this advancement, and Aware that, from thy calling, thou couldst find me Men of the mettle I might stand in need ofâ Pedro. I recollect. The first is foundâa Moor, One that will do the work, whereto you set him, Nor scan its quality. Alma. The man I need! Pedro. One who will serve you as he were your hand That does your will, nor questions you thereon; A stranger too, unknown in Saragossa! Of bearing also, such as will not shame you. Alma. The very man! When shall I see him? Pedro. Now. Alma. Bring him! [Pedro goes out.] The man I need. E'en upon thee I may not count, for thou hast friends; he, none. A tool, with friends, has but so many minds, May sway his own, and baffle his, he serves. I have won the game; but still, the stake 's to getâ To get, if needs, by force! I may not look To any that I know, for advance there; The stanchest there, might stop! I know not one I dare so much as e'en advise with there. Those who are heedless how Alasco fares, Would more than mutter, dared I breathe the thought Of trespasss 'gainst the Rose of Arragon. Enter Pedro and Omer. Alma. Is this the man?âhis air is very stately! Pedro. It is the carriage of his blood, my lord; Ne'er lack'd by its partaker. Alma. It is well! The reverend man I spoke ofâhave you found him? Pedro. I have. Alma. What says he? Pedro. He too will be your hand. Not more will question, 'less will do, your bidding. Alma. Warn him to come to me ere nine this evening, Ere the third quarter turns.âFriend, do you heed A woman's tears? [To Omer. Omer. They do not pierce the ear. Her shrieks do, and as little they would move me. Alma. What would you stop at, to obey the will Of him you served? Omer. At nothing till 'twas done! Alma. Not blood? Omer. No more, sir, than the blade which sheds it. Alma. Wait by my side.âAdvancement ne'er is bought, But at some cost of friends. I know not, now, Who loves me. Pry about you.âAs we go I'll tell you where my heart and soul have cast Their all of being on! Omer. An enemy, Whom you would overcome? He is at your feet! Alma. An enemy whom giv'st thou to mine arms, I'll fall at yours, as my good angel ever! Omer. A woman!âCan't you strain her to your mood Without my help?âYou Christians there are wrong, What we as minions treat, to rate as idols! You flatterâsueâimplore!âPossession speaks Our wishes! Alma. Well you please me, thus to talk. Thanks, Pedro!âCome!âkeep near me. Well you please me. [They go out. SCENE II. âA Chamber in the Citadel. Enter Alasco and Olivia. Alas. Olivia! Olivia. Well, my brother? Alas. It is long Since you and I have talk'd. Olivia. There was a time We had not been so long apart, Alasco, At liberty to meet! Alas. There was a time We had one heart!âThat time is past! Olivia. How long? Alas. E'er since the hour you spurn'd your brother's friend, His soul's election, from among the prime Acknowledged of his race, and gave your heart To throne a stranger. Olivia. He deserved it, brother! Alas. No, not thy heart!âThe throne that he was born to, I grant him worthy of, but not thy heart! There is but one such throne; as for the other, There are a hundred suchâay, maybe, better! How much, Olivia, did it weigh with you That he, you chose, was heir unto a throne? Olivia. Brother!â [Much hurt. Alas. I know! forgive me! Not a doit! Oh! my Olivia! lives the man durst slight thee, And do I so? That inadvertent wrong Hath, more than argument, set all to rights! Being here to blame, I have been all to blame! Forgive me! Love me! Take me to your heart Again, as I do thee to mine, my sister! Olivia. How like a new gift is old love restored! How seems it richer, though the very same! How the soul opens to receive it, wider Than e'er it did before!âAlasco! now I'll show thee, brother, I have all along Deserved thy love, deserving it e'en there Where thou account'st me wanting! Alas. Not a word Of that again! you prized the Prince's worth, Before you knew his title; which he doff'd, Lest, seeking love, he might ambition meet, And take it for its betters! You were wed Before you knew you were a prince's wife! Have you forgiven me? Olivia. Have I not, my brother? But, for mine own content, Alasco, hear me, While for thy sister's coldness to thy friend I give thee now her reason. Alas. Give it me, But for thine own content; not mine, Olivia:â Go on! Why do you hesitate? The thing You wish'd to tell me, and I would not hear, And then wish'd more to tell me; now I would hear it, Why do you hesitate to tell? Olivia. Alasco, You are so rash when you are angry. Alas. [Roused.] Ayâ Is there chance of that? Olivia. No, no! Alas. [Most impatiently.] There is! Olivia. You see! Wisely I kept it from thee at the time; Else, bloodshed had ensued! Alas. [With extreme impatience.] Bloodshed! for what? Olivia. Outrage long past! Alas. [Furiously.] Outrage!â[Recollects himself.] Long past is it? Then tell it me, no fear I shall be rash! No, nor yet angry! I shall look upon it As a thing that's dead, and no more wage war with it Than I would with a corse! Almagro offer'd thee No outrage? [Furiously. Olivia. There again! Alas. [Recovering himself.] And if he didâ 'Tis past and gone; so, dead.âGo on, Olivia, Go on, my sister! Olivia. You remember, don't you, From long-protracted absence, coming home, And finding me, whom you had left a girl, Stolen into womanhood? Stolen, I may say; For at that stage I had, indeed, arrived Without my father's note, or e'en my own; So change, by progress still before our eyes, Is oft-times past, before we dream 'tis near. Alas. That time, Olivia, I remember well! Then first I felt I was a brother, when The girl, I left, I found not; but, instead, A woman newly ripen'd! You had on The gear of other times! 'Twas quite outgrown, And scantiest there where nature's bounty most Upbraided lack of fulness! Oh, what thoughts Of risks and wrongs, by woman run and borne, Shot through my brain, succeeding one another As lightning-flashes, when the welkin round Is thick with thunder-storms!âawakening in me Tinglings of feelings never touch'd before, And summoning almost in palpable, Distinct embodiment, the household virtues To pass in solemn, stern array before meâ Among them honour chief, and chastity! I sprang to thee and o'er thy shoulders threw Thy kerchief, snatch'd from thy surprisÃ©d hand! The change pass'd o'er thee then, from frankest joy To see me back, to strangest wonderment! The change from that, to most alarm'd confusion, As, in a moment, burst on thee the thought What time had done, thou ne'er hadst ta'en account of, Till then reveal'd by that, thy brother's act! The statue that thou stood'st except the blush Which, prompted by that act, thy heart call'd up As 'twere to veil thy cheek, and answer for Thy earth-fix'd eye, that life had cast it there! I shall be old when I forget the hour I threw that kerchief o'er thee! Olivia. [Hesitating.] Brother! Alas. Well? Olivia. [Hesitating.] One dayâ Alas. Go on! what happen'd thee that day? Olivia. [Still hesitating.] That kerchiefâ Alas. Well? Olivia. I cannot tell it thee! I durst not even breathe it to my father! [Overpowered with confusion, and throwing herself on Alasco's neck. Alas. You need not! Some one pluck'd it off!âWho was it? Who was it?âfool!âwho was it but Almagro! The flood of light a little chink lets in! How blind a man may be, yet think he sees! How fast asleep, yet fancy he's awake! How may he be cajoledârobb'dâcozen'dâgull'dâ Where for fair dealing he would stake his life, As free as risk a counter on a card With all the odds to back him!âit is clear! Almagro's heart is rotten!âWhat have I done? Olivia. What have you done, my brother! Alas. What have I done? You know, and ask!âWhy, made Almagro Regent! Almagro Regent, in my sister's place! Given him command over myself, and worse, O'er thee, to whom he did that violence Turns all my blood to fire! how mayst thou fare. Olivia. Remember you your comment, once you read The story of Lucrece to me? You said She used too late her daggerâthat she chose Most ill, the stain itself contracting, rather Than bear the slanderous imputation, Howe'er so base-begotten; that her error The custom of her time could not atone for; The she was more to pride a martyr, than To chastity! unworthy setting up A sample of a woman fit to copy! Alas. Those very words thy brother's heart spoke to thee! Olivia. Those very words thy sister's heart set down, Never to be obliterated!âsee! [Drawing forth a dagger. Alas. Thou shalt not come to such extremity! O, let me think awhile my sisterâgoâ This is no home for thee!âGo!âHold thee, sister, In readiness to bear me company! But let me with myself awhile commune, There's something here wants calmingâsuch a sea Cannot at once go down, and give us leave To put the vessel on her course again! Olivia. Bless thee, Alasco! [Going. Alas. Sister, stay!âThe King!â His life 's in jeopardy! Olivia. The King is safe! I fear'd thee, brother,âdurst not breathe it to thee!â But he escaped last night by my contrivance! Alas. O woman! clear in apprehensionâprompt In action, when her sympathies arouse her! A mountain hast thou heaved from off my soul, And for reproaches, take my blessings with thee! Now leave me for a while! Olivia. My heart sinks in me At thought of losing sight of thee, my brother! [Goes out. Alas. How many things come back upon me, now, That pass'd me by, before, unheeded by me, To prove Almagro wanting!âThere is Gomez!â Gomez, he told me was a wretch!âhad fail'd him When trusted by him!âNow he hugs him!âAy, Gomez is now of service! There's Velasquez, A man far likelier to overlook, Than note a fault.âAlmagro must have play'd The viper to him, and Velasquez shuns him, Lest he be stung again. There's Henriquez, Blotches from head to foot, believe Almagro, And he was hand in glove with him before, For all his leprosy, when Henriquez Was factor to his fortunes.âBlind Alasco! Now I bethink me, where are Pedro, Carlos, And twenty others, once his good companions? True men and kindly!âWhere are they? gone from him! He comes!âuntimely!âwould I could avoid him. Enter Almagro and Theresa. Alma. You know your dutyâsee that you perform it. Let the reward that I have promised you Remind you of obedience. Suffer her not Out of your sightânor be thrust offânor humour'd; Your answerâforced to itââThe Regent wills it.â Not in a hurry though! Ther. I shall observe. [Goes out. Alma. Now am I jocund as the mariner Whose progress e'en before his reckoning runs, And, ere expected, shows his port to himâ Whose vessel seems belovÃ©d of the winds, Which follow her where'er she turns her prow. I am Regent!âThat is power achievedâAlasco Speeds to the army, and Velasquez, with him. That is immunity to use my power! Olivia stays in Saragossaâthat Is love achieved.âOh! Opportunity! Thou favourer of wishes, com'st thou to me, And shall I let thee go again, and say Thou left'st me mine unblest?âNo!âthough I craved The help of fraud or force to effect possession. Fair measures first I'll tryâthey bring our ends Most happily about. So be't. Let's seeâ A quarrel is to be made upâa fault Acknowledged and atoned forâso, from foes, We turn to friends.âThat's easyâbut to turn From friends to loversâthere's the feat that taxes Both wit and labour! There's Ruphino, thoughâ He hates me! Well!âthe good of the republic May crave his absence henceâsome honourable Employmentâlike Velasquez, and his son's! We'll find him such.âSo now, to see Olivia; Admit my error, own it past forgivenessâ The very surest way to make it venialâ Dilate on my contritionâsigh for friendship, Without a hope of itâa warranty Especial and infallible that she Will find me hope enoughâand here succeeding, To fair or foul means trust the rest;â [Going towards Olivia's apartment, meets Alasco. Alasco!â Here yet?âI swear thou art still a child, as much As in thy play-time years! Alas. Almagro!â Alma. Peace! Thou mak'st me mad!âWhat are the thews of manhood Without the thoughts and deeds?âIn patience' name, If thou wouldst bide with men, and rank with them, Be one of them, and act like them!âBalance here, Lounging upon the heel that should be smoking With rowels red with speed, at least ten leagues By this from Saragossa! Alas. But, Almagroâ Alma. Nay, talk to children, not to me!âBy our Lady, Thou art not a man!âA feebleness, Alasco, There is about you, hateful to my nature! An easiness that treats, as lightest things, Matters of gravest moment.âWe have placed Our hopes and fears, our liberties and lives, In a man's hands, as we believed; and lo! He turns out to be a boy! Alas. By your favourâ Alma. 'Sdeath! 'Tis injury to me!âfoul injury Return'd for all the good I have done for you! How will men talk?âwhat will my credit come to, For judgment or for justice? Fifty others Had leap'd at such a post, not one of whom Had so approved himself unworthy of it, As thou hast done! How shall I make defence, When they allege to me, they know your charger Stood cooling his mettle at the gate, the while You play'd the page, in your sister's antechamber! Alas. Where thou play'st visitor!âWhat brought thee hither? Almagro!âmark!âa brother speaks to you, And tells you that the floor you stand upon Henceforth to you is interdicted ground! Mark!âinterdicted by a brother's honour! Who holds the trespasser 'gainst his commands Responsible with his blood! Alma. To me, Alasco!â Do you say this to me?âto meâyour friend? Alas. Is it so, Almagro?âArt thou Alasco's friend? Alma. Can I be otherwise? Alas. Almagro, tell me, Are you a man of whom his friend can say, He knows his heart whene'er he hears his tongue; Or one whose tongue alleges of his heart Things that abide not there? Alma. What do you mean? Alas. What I say!âAlmagro, are you my friend indeed? Where's the reply ere well the question's done, That, from loved lips, can't brook the loving wrong, But, from one word divining all the rest, The mouth of the propounder stops with flouts, Which, while they chafe, assure him. Art thou my friend? You are sullen!âIll at ease, I will not sayâ Why did you start when I saidââIll at ease?â You are not my friend!âwhen you declared you were so, You spoke what was not true! Alma. Sir! Alas. Saint Iago! 'Tis come to âSir!â The truth is out at last, then! 'Tis come to âSir!â 'twixt you and me! There's chance then That it may come to blows!âIs there, Almagro? âSirââ'Tis as clear as day!âIt could not be! The thing's impossible. Alma. What is impossible? Alas. That a strong stream should stop with frost, nor give The eye of the observer time to wink, Ere what was flood is ice.âI have been basking In summer, dreaming on a bank of snow, And freezing now awake! âSirââ Alma. You forget I am Regent! Alas. You are Regent?âOh, you are Regent! True!âtrue!âyou are another kind of man!â Of all anomalies, the most outrageous Is thisâthat circumstances should make the man More that the man himselfâjust as if men Were no wit better than the meats they feed on, Whose value varies by the mode of dressing; That what, to-day, will bring one pistole only, By change of cookery brings five to-morrow! You are Regent? 'Tis too bad!âThe brute, in this, Fares far more rationally than his master, For he is rated by his own properties, And gives rank to kennelâtakes none from it! Who made you Regent? Alma. Who?âthe people! Alas. I! Alma. 'Tis false! Alas. Ha! say you so?âCome on then! you're A traitor! Alma. What? Alas. You heard!âIs it possible? Then was it true what some one told me once, That when he threaten'd thee with chastisement, Whereof he gave thee earnest with his tongue, In terms the bearer better were struck dead, Than unrevenged survive them, thou didst stand E'en thus. Alma. How? Alas. Why the 'haviour of a sheet! Anger, I know, turns pale as well as red; But if it lacks the hue, it has the blow!â My sister, recreant!âI will not draw On one that dares not draw on me again, Nor even wag my tongue at such a man! âMan!â do I say?âWell, âman.ââI scorn to rail! [Ruphino enters in the back-ground, and stopping short, half-retires again. Alma. Alasco! you have spurn'd me!âshamefully Aspersed my manhood!âand I bear it all, For I am not a friend plays fast and loose! Nay, wrong me more!âI will the more forbear. Thou doubt'st it?âbut a proof can face a doubt! And I have one at hand, will make thee writhe, That ever thou misus'dst me. Wait a little, I'll give thee time to cool,âprovide my proof; And then return, and we are friends again! [Goes out. Ruph. Alasco! [Hastily advancing. Alas. Father! Ruph. Hast thou been, Alasco, A son to me? Alas. In love,âbut not in duty! Ruph. In duty too, dost thou my bidding now! Wilt do it? Alas. Yes! Ruph. Wilt swear to do it? Alas. Yes; I swear! Ruph. He hears thee who remembers, boy! Forthwith depart for thy command.âVelasquez Waits with thy courser at the postern.âFly! Thou'lt find within his breast another heart True to thee as thine own!âConfide in him!â Alas. Almagro!â Ruph. Peace!âAlmagro means thee evil! Thy sister's honour is in jeopardyâ I know what thou wouldst say.âIt is too late! She could not fly with thee, were she prepared, Or were there means at hand, or were there time To furnish them. She is betray'd!âbeset!â The safety which she cannot fly to,âthou Must bring to her, my son, and speedilyâ It must come speedily, if it come at all! Alas. Why, father!â Ruph. What!âin my extremity Cannot I find a friend in my own son! Thy sister, by Almagro's treason warn'd, Has set the King at liberty, and word Was by his secret escort brought that he Had to the patriot force commission sent With terms of such redress, as their demands, O'erbearing as they were, durst ne'er lift eye to! I should not wonder, met you now advancing, And hand in hand, those who the other day Bore weapons against weapons! There is rescue! Safety! for me, thy sister!âall of us! Awayâaway,ânot by the common stairâ Almagro now ascends it, with his guards! They come for theeâbelieve me for this once! This passage to thy sister, by her lord Reveal'd, by her to me,âand which were now Portal to liberty, were she not watch'd By spies, who dog her every footfallâsafe Without the postern will conduct thee.âFlyâ No word!âThy oath!âThy sister's honour!âFly! [Alasco goes out. Enter Almagro with Guards, and attended by Nunez and Omer. Alma. [Speaking as he enters.] Secure the traitor!âonly now his sword Was pointed 'gainst your Regent's heart. Nunez. My lord, Alasco is not here!âThis is his father. Alma. Not here!âI left him here!âwhere is the traitor? Ruph. Inquire, Almagro, of thyself for him! Alma. Where is thy son? Ruph. Safe, monster, from thy fangs! Alma. What! fled!âGo seek him in the room beyond. Some nook will give him to you.âHe could not fly! Myself stood sentry on the stair. [All go out but Almagro and Ruphino. Ruph. You did? You needs must love the friend you watch so well! Alma. You mock at things make other men look grave. Ruph. What things? Alma. Bonds!âmaybe death! Ruph. O Heav'n! this man To talk of bonds and death to me that was More than his equal yesterday!â'Tis thus Fair enterprise falls into disrepute, And the just fight is lost!âSome hollow heart Makes common cause with the abettors; toils, Suffers perhaps; draws on himself all eyes, All trust, until their cause and he be one; When gets he all he asks for,âsought for,âpower! The which, awhile, he wields to profit them; But, now secure of, casts the mask aside, Employs for his own ends, without consent Of man or angel, until those that groan'd At evil days gone by, now shake the head And wish them back again! Alma. Thy life 's near spent! Husband the little that remains of it. Ruph. He husbands life who looks not to its length But use, and uses it to glorify The giver! Alma. Dotard!âHither comes your son! Ruph. Turn not your face aside, nor move away; You need not shrink from him, he does not come! Re-enter Nunez and the others. Alma. Is he not found? Nunez. No! Alma. No? He must be here! He pass'd not forth!âI swear he pass'd not forth. Where is your son, old man?âWhat smile you at? Ruph. At your simplicity, Almagro. Alma. Ay! Ruph. Ay, sir, to ask a father for his son, That you may give him up to butchery! He is safe, sir, safe!âHis father's life upon it! Alma. Maybe!âMaybe!âHe must be found! Enter Cortez, hastily. Cortez. The Regent? Alma. Here, sir! Cortez. Obedient to your highness' will, I sought the King, in straiter custody To place him. Alma. Well, sir!âand you found him? Cortez. No. Alma. Treason on every side!âProduce your son! Ruph. I cannot! Alma. Tell us where you have bestow'd him. Ruph. I will not! Alma. Take him to the rack! Ruph. The rack!â What!âan old man like me?âWell, then, the rack! Thou mock'st its strength, to waste it on a straw! Nunez. My lord, forbear! Alma. What!âNunez? Nunez. To this pass Let it not come. Cortez. Give ear, my lord, to Nunez! Alma. Talk to a whirlwind!âAm I Regent, Cortez; Or you, or Nunez? Nunez. Hand will I have none In such a deed. Cortez. Nor I. Alma. You will not?âAy!â Omer,âSee it done!âYou may withdraw, my friends. [Nunez and Cortez retire. Away with him! Ruph. When the command shall come That summons thee away, thou'lt shrink from it, As never shall my body from the rack! [Ruphino is taken out by Omer and Guards. Alma. Hence!âNow have I thought what Chaos was, Before the world sprung out of it!âImmense Perplexity of things!âNothing, itself! Naught individuality, but merging Into some other thing. Ambition, Love, Hatred, Revenge, Determination, Fear, All holding sway together, but with strife That makes a mock of rule! I cannot see The light for darkness; darkness fails with light! I cannot stop,ânor yet, for stops, go on!â I am not anywhere,âyet everywhere! Somewhere to fix!âsome shape to give resolve! It takes a form, and straightway vanishes Into some otherâthen another yet, Until confusion reels! Enter Pedro. Pedro. My lord! Alma. Well, Pedro? Has the old man confess'd? Pedro. No. Alma. No!âEnough; Remove him from the rack! Pedro. That duty, death Has spared us. Alma. Dead? Pedro. He is dead! Alma. I feel his frost! He freezes more than I, but feels it not! As with the thunder comes the clearing up, So ends this shock my chaos, and my thoughts Begin to settleâinto ruin!âRuin?â Come ruin, then, but not to me alone! [Goes out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âThe Ante-room to Olivia's Chamber. Two Attendants variously occupiedâa knock at the doorâwhich one of them opens. Enter Almagro, Anthonio, and Omer. Alma. You are dismiss'd till morning.âYou will find Your couches in the quarter that we spoke of.â Withdraw; and mind, thanks but precede rewards, Not stand for them, with us! Meantime we thank you. Good night.â [Attendants go out, Almagro locks the door after them. Anthonio! [Anthonio comes forward. Are you a man of nerve? Anth. I dare aver I am. Alma. 'Tis a great property, Which more avails men in this world of barter Than what they buy or sell;âyou know what I mean? The nerve that gains its point, no matter how! You will perform the ceremony? Anth. Yes. Alma. Howe'er she may protest, gainsay, entreat, Threaten, change colour, weep, shriek, swoon awayâ It may come to thatâin any case whatever, You will not halt, but on? Anth. I shall go on! Alma. And I shall render the responses, both For her, and for myself. Retire and wait In the OratoryâThat's the door to it.â [Anthonio goes out. Omer! Omer. My lord! Alma. 'Tis likely, as I told you, Your aid may stead me; in which case, approve The Moor may boast in you a worthy son. You will see her tears, as though you saw them not! And hear her cries, as though you heard them not! And limbs, whose tenderness dissuades enforcement, Reply to as the vice would, say it held them! Behind these hangings take thy station, till My summons asks thy aidâtill then keep still! Omer. I shall observe, my lord. [Omer conceals himself. Alma. And I reward! 'Tis near the time she makes her toilet up For the night.âAnon she'll summon her attendants, And missing their reply, no doubt come forth. [The clock strikes. Hark!âHer remembrancer!âListen! Olivia [within]. Therese! Alma. Well answer'd, silence! Olivia. What!âTherese!âTherese! Christina, where are you? [Enters, without perceiving Almagro, who retires a little. Where are my maids? I am left alone by themâand purposely! I am sure of it!âAlasco does not come, Nor message has he sent me!âFlight he talk'd of, And still am I in Saragossa! Oh! What mountain huge and inaccessible Has fate heaved up between us?âHas he seen Almagro? tax'd him with the shame he did me? And, for his honest rashness, answer'd with His libertyâperhaps his life? That man Is match for all extremities!âThat man, I have heard my father say, to gain his end, Would stop at noughtânot blood!âMy father, too! 'Tis past the time he used to visit me, An hour; nor has he comeâno word from him! My motions watch'dâegress, debarr'd me, from The quarters set apart for me!âthe cause, Reasons of stateâââthe Regent's will;â but why His will, or why those reasons, held from meâ The door! perhaps 'tis free. Lock'd on me still! [Tries to open it. Heaven is not lock'd!âThere is my only refuge! I'll in, nor other couch enjoy to-night Save what my knees can make them of the ground, Whence shall my soul look up to heaven till morning! [Retiring, is intercepted by Almagro. Almagro! Alma. Not so fast, Oliviaâstop; Or, if you will return into your chamber, I'll pass along with you. Olivia. Hoa!âhelp there! Alma. [Grasping her wrist.] Silence! Shriek not! Olivia. My wrist is broken, sir. Alma. I grasp'd it, But not with undue force. Olivia. Look there!âthe blood In answer to your fingers!âFie!âa man And use a woman so! Where are my women!â Wherefore attend they not?âwhy not obey My summons?âwhere are they? Alma. Hence, by my orders; Far out of reach of hearingâas all others Who might intrude upon the conference I mean to hold with you!âYou will call in vain! Olivia. Confer with thee!âhere?âat this time o' night, Alone?âa man?âand one I shudder at In company, and in the open day? Confer!âBegone, sir!âIf respect, on thy part, Does not instruct thee to recross my threshold, Let loathing upon mine! Think what I am, sir, And if thou hast forgot thou art a man, Let that remind thee on't, and make thee blush, And drive thee from my presence! Alma. What art thou? Olivia. What am I, sir?âa wife!âI am a wife!â A name that's haply borne by one that's weak, But gives a power to her, to cope with which, He that would mock her must make up his mind To abide the wrath of the stern sanctities Which, in the names of father, brother, husband, Protect the wearer's honour! Alma. With your leave, At least a word or two before we part. Olivia. No! not a syllable! Alma. Without your leave, then! Olivia. Dare you compel me? Alma. If you force me!âGirl, You are in my power! Olivia. Heavens! and for this same man My brother would have laid his life down! [To herself.] Where Is my brother?âAt the thought of strait to him, Danger or worse, how, all at once, my heart Casts off the shackles of congealing fear, And feels at large, with all its faculties! [Resolutely approaches Almagro, without looking at him, through abhorrence. Almagro, where is my brother? Almagro. [Confounded momentarily.] Where! Olivia. Take time; The answer's not at handânot to be found Except by dint of searching for'tâtake time! Yet why delay at all?âTruth has no answer Save oneâif that won't serve, there's falsehood with A thousand!âTake the first of themâfrom first To last, they are all the same!âIs he alive? Alma. He is! Olivia. Where is he? Alma. Gone to his command, As I suppose. Olivia. As you suppose! You met Before he went? Alma. I think we did. Olivia. You think! You had no words? Alma. Words! Olivia. Words! You did not quarrel? Alma. Quarrel! Olivia. No mortal strife fell out between you? No swords were drawn, nor daggers, yet, pluck'd forth, Were there? Alma. My hand fall from my side, if sword Or dagger quitted sheath of mine to-day! Olivia. [Aside.] No thunder yet, and thunder-clouds all round! Out of such pitch and wrack a bolt must come!â My father! how is it with him? Almagro, How fares it with my father? where is he? Or access, hither, is prevented him, Or, hence, he bears my brother company, Or something or another has befallen him. Why don't you speak, Almagro? [Looking at him.] Gracious powers! Your face, which scarce till now I lifted eye to, Is not the same! but changed, and horribly. How you remind me of a wretch I saw Taken in the act of murder once! He had pass'd me An hour before, a hale young man. The change An hour had made in him! He had aged a life In that brief hourâand so have you since last I look'd upon you, near as brief a lapse! Almagro, where is my father? Tell me, man! What takes away your breath, or strikes you dumb?â I am not your accusing spiritâI am only My father's child! Are you his murderer?â He is murder'd! Alma. [by an effort recovering himself]. Well may wonder gasp to meet, From lips so loved, question of act so hateful! Listen and interrupt me not.âThy vows Thy father-King has all absolved thee from; Thou art free to wed again, and wed to me This very hour shall see thee! Olivia. Wed to thee! Alma. You heard me, did you not? Olivia. Hast thou encounter'd The horror of the wolf-pack, as, at night, The howl at distance on the mountain road Admonish'd thee, when hunger was abroad Roaming ravine and steep, cut off from food, As the earth lay entomb'd in frozen snow? I have, until my blood almost congeal'd, My joints began to lose their faculty, And, but for help, I must have dropp'd and lain, Incapable of motion as a stone! 'Twas nothing to the thought of wedding thee!â Though that I know a thing impossible!â Not with the wolf-pack so! knew I the track The famish'd monsters would be sure to come; Sooner would I lie in it, bound hand and foot, Than risk the chance would make me bride to thee! Thy hand, presenting me the bridal ring, I would recoil from as it brought to me My brother's corse! Yea, as 'twere reeking with My father's blood!âPreserve me, Heaven! he looks Again the very heart and soul of murder! Alma. [Recovering himself.] I'll speak to thee once more and then I'll act. Observe! Within this quarter, where thou bidest, There breathe not any can be hindrance to me! The forms and agents, that make man and wife Are ready!âSure as in that chamber lies Thy couch, and his, thou call'dst aforetime lordâ That couch receives another lord to-night! Consent! Olivia. I thinkâand madden while I think! O husband, where art thou!âAlasco!âFather! A wife! a child!âa sister!âand no help! Alma. Consent!âprovoke not force! Olivia. I dare you, wretch! Ay, woman as I amâweak and aloneâ I execrate, abhor you, and defy you! Alma. What, hoa!âwithin there! [Omer and Anthonio advance. Olivia. [Draws a dagger.] Is it so? behold, then! This talisman will I defeat thee with, Summoning him, with whom, to side with me, I am more than match for all who come against me! Witness, e'en you, [to Omer and Anthonio] the act that wrecks my life, To save my honour, is not mine, but his Who on this dread extremity impels me!â Mine honour!âprecious for itself, past life, But doubly precious for my dear lord's sake; In faith to whom my heart pours out the blood, No drop of which was e'er rebellious to him. [Omer arrests her arm as she is going to stab herself; she struggles desperately with himâand, at last, falls fainting into his arms. Alma. Prevent herâOh, well done!âWhat, is she dead? [Trumpet at a great distance. Omer. She has fainted. Alma. Hark!âwhat hear you! Omer. I mistake, Or 'tis a trumpet. Alma. From without the walls? Omer. I thought so. Alma. There it is again!âIt speaksâ Omer. Like a friend. Alma. I hope so. Cortez [without]. Where is the Regent? Alma. [Unlocking the door.] Here! Enter Cortez. Cortez. Alasco and the King, their powers combined, Approach the gatesâA herald in their names Demands admittance, which the crowd, not only, But e'en the soldiery, to yield incline. Ruphino's death is bruited far and wide, And discontent thereon is open-mouth'd. Still of your special friends the most stand true, The which to keep behoves you show yourself. Alma. I come to them!âAway!âI follow you. [Cortez goes out. Observe my signetâshould I send it to you, [To Omer, aside. The purpose now you balk'd yourself effect. 'Tis but her own intent that you fulfil; So may the act light on your conscience sit. That done, you know where lie my coffersâTake The key and help yourself!âAttend me, father! [Goes out with Anthonio. Alarum and tumult, without. Re-enter the Priest. Priest. This signet from the Regent. Omer. What has happen'd? Priest. Almagro, striving to retain the city, Was by his own abettors overborne. The gates have welcomed in their former master, With whom Alasco enters now; which issue As soon as he foresaw, Almagro gave This signet to me with injunction strict To place it in thy hand. I pray thee, Moor, What means it? Omer. What concerns not thee to know! Priest. Why whither wouldst thou take her? That way lies Her chamber. Omer. Pay no heed to what I do!â Nor follow me!âThe task I've ta'en in hand Abides not lookers on! Stay where thou art! [Shows the dagger.] Look to thyself! Dismiss all heed of me. [Bears Olivia off. Priest. I little dream'd of this! That weapon, now, So bright, how will it show anon? I thank The Moor, for wishing me away! Too much My share, already, in the deed of blood, He goes to do! Might I not stop it? No! He knows my business here!âI am compromised! Say that I brought him to the scaffold, thither He would not pass alone! Clean hands behoves The man who dares to prate of filthy ones! [Goes out. SCENE II. âThe Corridor of the Palace. Enter Velasquez and Andreas, meeting Nunez. Velas. Saw you Alasco, as you came along? Nunez. No, sir. Velas. The same response I meet from all: Strange, how I lost him all at once!âWe enter'd The citadel together! Where can he be? Only a word or two I changed with one, Apart, who drew me to confer with him, And straight returning found Alasco vanish'd. Nunez. Remember'st who was with him? Velas. Cortez. Nunez. Right! Myself remark'd themâoverheard them speaking, Touching the manner of Ruphino's murder, The while Almagro, guarded, walk'd before. Velas. Almagro? You remind me now of him. Him, also, did I miss. Nunez. At the same time? Where'er they are, most like they are together! Velas. The chance o'erleaps your guessâBe sure they are! At such a juncture, save his father's death, And him the hated instrument of it, nothing Could so engross Alasco that he leaves The throne untended that gives amnesty To wide revolt; and, for the grace it deigns, Receives whole hearts with thrice-sworn homage back! Let's search for good Alasco.âNear Almagro, Chain'd though he were alreadyâhe's no match, For such a maze of wily villany! SpeedâBestir yourselfâHe must be found! [They go out. SCENE III. âThe Dungeon of Torture. Around, the various implements. In the front, on one side, the rack; on the other, the block. Enter Alasco,âstops and looks after him. Alas. Why do you hesitate? Come in, Almagro! Come in. Enter Almagro, Pedro, Omer, and Guards. Alma. A strange place this for conference! Alas. It is a silent and retired place: What fitter then? Here are no eaves-droppers! No thin partitions which invite the ear While they repel the eye!âFree speech may here Make free! Your sword, good jailer, leave with me, And lay it noiselessly on yonder bench; Then, with your friends retire; and as you go, Make fast the door. An hour hence, come again!â By then we shall have done. There for your pains. [Aside to Jailer. [Gives a purse to the Jailer, who retires with Guards, locking the door after them, having previously laid his sword as directed. Omer remains concealed. Alma. Why does he lock the dungeon door? Alas. To keep Intrusion out. Such friends as you and I, Sharing their hearts loving with one another, Endure not bystanders when they confer! Is it not so? Alma. Why are we here? Alas. Almagro! Why are we anywhere but by the will Of Heaven?âIts will be done!âWill you say so? Alma. Why should I not? Alas. Why, Heaven has given command To men, they shall not murder; and 'tis written, Who sheddeth blood shall bleed!âSit down, Almagro, On yonder engine.âI shall seat me here; Such things awaken thoughts of seriousness, And serious is the work we have in hand!â Won't you sit down?âDecline you the fair seat? You shrink from it! You are a man of ruth! You know full well it is the couch of groans,â Of sweat-drops, wrung by dint of agony,â Of death-pangs, thick and sharp, though lingering, In one of which more writhing, than he knows Who, limb by limb, is broken on the wheel!â And yet, when I bethink myself again, I wonder you should loathe the instrument! For look at me!âI breathe as free as ever; My arms are folded o'er a heart at ease; Its wonted hue, methinks, invests my cheek, And I am sitting on the very block, Yet never lifted axe to lop a head!â Come!âtake your seat, Almagro! Alma. What do you mean? Alas. I'll tell you, answer me a word or two! Did I not trust you?âdid I not love you?âboth With the simplicity of a very boy? You know I did.âIf not, why, say so.âWell? Alma. I do not say so. Alas. No?âso far, so well. Alma. What do you purpose?âWherefore bring me hither? Alas. I haven't done yet!âWas't not my pride, Almagro, To build you up in men's esteem above Myself?âWhene'er they gave Alasco credit For this or that desert,âdid he not mount Your merits on his own? If he did not, Deny it. Alma. Nay, I don't deny it. Alas. Well, Again! Alma. Alasco, this is freezing work! Alas. Not so, Almagro,âall the frost's to come! You were a man of doubtful rank, Almagroâ I mean in men's esteemâwhen first I knew you; Among our comrades, some would rate you low, Some high, though doubtingly; none very high! I raised you to the top, and kept you there; Yea, when the people's choice between us lay In even balance; 'gainst myself, I gave The casting vote, at once, that made you Regent! Now, to the credit sideâmy debts to you! They are few, but large, Almagro!âForemost, then, A sister's sacredness profaned!âThat trespass, Had I learn'd it, then, from all the rest had saved theeâ Tell me how a man a modest woman treats, And I'll tell you what kind of man he is! In the next placeâmy credit underminedâ You know who Cortez is?âand with the smile, As of a friend, that play'd fast and loose, My freedom joepardizedâperhaps my life!â And last of allâay,âlook upon the rack!â You might as well have laid an infant on it, You would as soon!âI believe it!âlast of all, My father, like a sound leaf withering, Which if allow'd to hang its little time Falls with a breath that hardly stirs the spray, Thou wouldst not suffer dreamingly to die, But brought'st, with heart to ruth impenetrable, As flint to dew, to an untimely end, Forestalling sleep with torture! Alma. You forget! Your father hated meâWhat progeny, Except the serpent, should the serpent have? You thwarted me!âWho would not push aside The let that stood 'twixt his soul's wish and him? Your sister drove me mad with love, and spurn'd me! Alas. You never knew what love was!âLove!âWhat! love A virtuous maiden, and, with no inclining On her part towards thee, dare to violate Even the gauze that veils her modest face? He ne'er knew loveâcan never knowâwho knows not Woman, unlapsÃ©d is, next to Heav'n, most sacred! Say that the man, who would profane her, loves her! And if he does, brutes love as much as he! You ne'er went mad with anything so holy! Alma. Why have you brought me to this place? Alas. To die! That thou shouldst bring me to the pass, Almagro, That makes me tell thee this!âme!âthy Alasco! Thine even more, in cherishing, than ever He was his own; whose brain, heart, body, limbs, At any time sooner than for himself, He had laid down for thee!âWhen a gaunt bear Rush'd from a thicket towards thee, once, who lay, Ere thou couldst wink, struggling upon the ground 'Twixt thee and him?âcalling to thee to fly, So all forgetful was he of himself, Although entangled in the deadly hug Of the fell monster? With my forest-knife I saved this arm its blood,âso saving theeâ This arm, now nerved to kill thee!â[Drawing.]âHow can this be? How has it come to pass?âWhence this blank wreck Of love, so stanchly built, I could have sworn The storm blew never yet could break it up! Tell me!âfor I am wild with wondering! Alma. I wonder too, but am not wild withal, That thou shouldst wish to take thyself the life Thou knowest to be forfeited. Alas. Why, who So fit to be thy executioner?â To fill the office whose revolting nature Flesh creeps at so, its functionary sickens, With loathing, those who only look upon him?â Who, for an office so unnatural, So fit, as such a trespasser 'gainst nature As I am?âto a stranger to my blood Who gave that trust, which to the source of it I owed, but would not give!âExcept for me, Thou ne'er hadst laid my father on the rack; 'Twas I who gave thee power o'er his grey hairs, I was his murderer as well as thou. Of felons men make executioners! Alma. My blood be on thy soul, so shedd'st thou it! Alas. Almagro, I will shed it!âthou must bleed, And by this hand; but I will use this hand As it becomes a soldier and a man!â Here is another sword!âThis brave revenge Breathed I the wish to take, I were prevented! The meanest hind in Arragon would flout The thought of honourable chastisement To one so fallen as thou art,âbut I hold it A debt due to a father by his son, And mean to pay it in full!âNo further parley! What is infirm in theeâas well I know, But must not now cast thought toâoverlook! Come, guard thy life!âstrike manfully at mine! 'Tis the last time its bane may prove thy safeguard! Alma. Hold yet a moment!âthou wouldst give me, sure, Fair play! Thy weapon is the longer one!â Alas. Measure it!âThere! [Gives his sword to Almagro, who throws it away. Alma. Lo! thou who, now, so freely, Wouldst shed Almagro's blood, and, boastingly, Wouldst make a merit on't; look to thine own! Not by Alasco's honourable sword, Nor by the scaffold, shall Almagro die! Such means am I provided with as scoff At aught the executioner, or thou Canst perpetrate against me. Mark, Alasco! Almagro dies, but thou shalt die before him; For in thy weakness, which I ever loath'd, I see the bane that to this close has brought My dearest hopes and me! Yet, ere I use The vantage which thy trustfulnessâI thank it For the last timeâhas given me, it is fit Thou know the full extent of what thou owest me. Thou thought'st thy debt on the score of old Ruphino Was large enough; but what will be thy wonder When I shall tell thee thou mayst add to that Another larger yet? Know then, Alascoâ Soon as the tide of fortune 'gan to ebb, Sudden as it set in, and 'gainst the chance Of aught which thou, and those in league with thee, Could practise 'gainst me, I secured myself;â By my contrivance did thy sister's dagger Drink her own blood! Alas. Now let thy sword drink mine! I will not swerve to avoid thee!âlift my arm To hinder thee!âmove so much as a finger! I am a man the earth must loathe to bear! All who live on't must loathe! who loathes himself! Alma. Loathe, as thou mayst, thyself, I loathe thee more. An end to words, save such as deeds can speak. [As Almagro is on the point of rushing upon Alasco, Omer discovers himself, and confronts him. Omer. An end to deeds of thine! Alasco livesâ Ruphino lives!âOlivia lives!âNone dies Except the Moor, and he but dies in name; Dies, that the PrinceâAlasco's brother, and Ruphino's sonâmay live the husband of Olivia! See! Wake from thy dreams of guilt, Rouse thee!âand die. [Pedro enters, conducting Velasquez, followed by Ruphino, Olivia, the King, &amp;c.âAlmagro drops his swords. Alas. My father!âsister!âIs it reality? Olivia. It is, Alasco! Thanks to the gracious prince, Whose love for me transform'd him, thus, and brought To Saragossa, where he counted on Concealment from a friendâmy tongue refuses To rate him lessâwho, though of calling harsh, He knew to be of kindly heart and true. Alas. [To the Prince.] What shall I say to thee? Prince. Call me thy brother! King. As hence, thy sister I shall call my child! Alma. [Aside.] Destroy'd by those I deem'd my instruments! Frustrated in revenge, in love, and hate! What fair set-off 'gainst such discomfiture? The gibbet cheated, or the block, or wheel! Could we cheat Heaven!âNo circumventing there! What's this I see?âInstead of the huge World, A film; and what before was shadowy, The World to come, condensing into vast Enormous substance, insupportable To thought! The drug asserts its potency! This is the death-sweat that bedews my palms, My forehead and my lip, and like a cold And slimy serpent, coiling round my frame, With its loathed folds, my very marrow chills. King. What man is he, that yonder stands and lives, Yet seems in mortal agony? Alas. Almagro. King. What!âhe?âthen has he look'd upon the sun For the last time!âThe rack shall deal with him. No death-bed half so fit. Let's leave him to it. [Going. Alas. Oh no, my liege! King. Thou wouldst not plead for him! Up! up! thy knee rebels, young man, to bend 'Gainst nature!âjustice!âEarth and Heaven, themselves, To supplicate for him whom they condemn! Against thy father's life thou makest suit, Against thy sister's honourânot to name The wrong he meditated 'gainst thyself! Forbear, young man. Why hang you thus your head, And still the posture keep that casts it down? What would you ask for? Alas. Time for penitence. A month! Well, then, a week! If not a week, A day! Between the attempt, sir, and the act There is a difference; so should there be Between the pains with which we visit them. The crimes he dies for were not perpetrated; No victim calls for retribution. Spare him!âspare him! We were boys together. Howe'er it changes with us on life's road, The sunny start all intervals breaks through, And warms us with the olden mood again! The hearty laugh of youth is in mine ear, And there stands he, who shared it with me; now A woful bankrupt; while the rich possessions I counted lost, are all my own again. I can't forbear. Say that I hold my tongue, My eyes will speak; you see they do without; And for the playmate's sake implore thee spare The man, although a weak and guilty one! King. Against my judgment does my heart give way, Corrupted by your tears. His life is yours: Do with it what you list! Alas. It shall be spared. An exile shall he live to die in penitence! Almagro! Pedro. Hush! He dies by poison, sir! I know the signs. He makes a sudden end! His spirit's goneâit fleeted with that groan! Alas. The pardon you permitted, Heav'n denies him! Its justice and its mercy are its own! END OF THE ROSE OF ARRAGON.</field>
