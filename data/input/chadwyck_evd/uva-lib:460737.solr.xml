      <field name="fulltext">The Witness; A TRAGEDY, IN THREE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. A great majority of the new plays are condemned in the first performance, and many of those which the public consents to tolerate are but little esteemed; it has therefore been thought, that, among the rejected pieces, some might be found not inferior in merit to those preferred by the managers; and that a collection of them would enable the lovers of the drama to appreciate the taste and judgment with which the management of the theatres is conducted, in relation to the refusal and reception of plays, and how far the assertion is correct, that the pantomimic state of the stage is owing to a decline in the dramatic genius of the nation. In undertaking to supply this desideratum, the proprietors of âThe Rejected Theatreâ are actuated solely by a wish to vindicate the reputation of English literature from the charge which has so long been, in their opinion unjustly, urged against the dramatic department. They cannot believe, while in every other branch of polite learning the nation has been regularly advancing, that the drama should have been as regularly retrograde. In the prosecution of this work, they expect to verify their own opinion, and to convince the public that there might be a better mode of ascertaining what pieces are or are not suitable for representation, than that which is now in practice. If the managers of the theatres imagine that we are instigated by motives of resentment, arising from feelings of personal disappointment, it will only serve to rivet our conviction that men of intellects so mean and narrow ought not to have an unlimited control over the most exalted amusement of polished life; far less the arbitrary power of treating, as their caprice may dictate, the most difficult and dignified production of human genius. In truth, the conduct of the managers is below our consideration. We aspire to introduce some degree of reformation into a great department of the national means of instruction, and will rarely condescend to notice those kind of shows which the patentees of the theatres may think it profitable to encourage. We are hostile to the principle of monopoly, and our undertaking is levelled against its effects on the stage. Taste is so nearly allied to good sense, that it is impossible to corrupt the one without having previously impaired the other. If the public taste be so corrupted, as the apologists for the present state of the English drama assert, it is a painful, an alarming consideration, and more dangerous to the future welfare of the country than all those excrescences in the government, to which theoretical quacks so loudly call attention, and endeavour to exalt themselves by offering to cure. But, as in all other matters the nation never thought more judiciously than it does at present, and as through a long course of political events of the most extraordinary nature, it has acted with an admirable constancy of affection for those institutions and principles which the experience of all ages had demonstrated to be the best, we will not believe that the good sense of England is so far impaired, as the public taste appears to be corrupted, judging from the exhibitions of the stage. For we know that the public has no choice in the exhibitions,âthat it is not allowed to prefer, but only to condemn; and we do not think that what it submits to receive from the managers is generally admired. On the contrary, in all circles, the theatrical spectacles are despised: and we believe that the theatres are indebted for their chief support, more to the multitude of strangers constantly in town, and who have no other way of spending the evening, than to the established inhabitants. Mankind in quest of amusement are easily pleased, and crowds are always generous. If the audience applaud the show of the managers, it is because they are disposed for amusement, and do not measure their satisfaction by the merits of the performance. A regular frequenter of the theatre, however, can easily discriminate the applause excited by excellence, and the approbation bestowed on the endeavours of mediocrity. The inclination for dramatic entertainments is, in the present age, more general, than it ever was before in this country. There is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom, without a regular theatre; few even of the villages are unvisited by the itinerant actors; and the whole of them derive their fund of entertainment from the two metropolitan houses. It must be evident, that so general a predilection cannot exist without some genius for the dramatic art being actively excited. Although every other thing is supposed to have acquired a private, a local, or a provincial reputation for excellence, before it receives the approbation of the embodied intelligence of the kingdom in London, it so happens at present, that the fruit of this dramatic genius is brought before the metropolitan public in its crudest state, and that the audience in London, are obliged to hear and see performances, which are not worthy of being exhibited in the meanest country theatres. The very reverse of this might be expected. It might be thought, before any play was brought out in London, that it had received the full applause of the provinces, and was honored with an exhibition in the capital, as the final criterion of its merit, and to confirm or annul the celebrity, which it had previously obtained. The origin of the present custom is well-known. The theatre was first established in town, and the country having acquired its taste for the drama from London, has continued under every alteration of circumstances, habitually to draw from the same source. The consequence is, that in the country the literary department of the stage is much better than in town, for only the best pieces are acted in the provinces, while all the bad are never heard of beyond the capital. Why is this the case? why is there a different rule for the plays and the players? Few actors have the assurance to make their first appearance on the London boards, and still fewer of those who do so, ever afterwards, attain much distinction in their profession. Almost all the best performers, perhaps it may be justly said, that all the performers of the first class of every department, have had their fame in London before them, and have been summoned to the metropolitan theatres, by the voice and curiosity of the public. Might not some such rule as that which governs the performers, be established for the improvement of compositions for the stage? The very last stock Tragedy properly deserving the name, was originally performed in a provincial theatre. We allude to the Douglas by Home. Perhaps, had it been first exhibited in town, its celebrity would have been less; it might even have failed, for the author would have been convicted, on the first night, of his plagiarism from the Merope of Maffei, but the Douglas was brought out in a quarter where Italian literature has never been much cultivated. It may be said that this example rather furnishes a proof of the utility of the custom of introducing the new pieces first in London. We think not. For, notwithstanding that the whole train of maternal anxiety in the tragedy of Douglas, is a most remarkable imitation of the same feeling in the Merope, still the piece has great intrinsic merit, and beauties which fully entitle it to all the fame that it has obtained. Merit and beauties, however, which would not have been, probably, sufficient to have borne it up against the rash flippancy of newspaper criticism, especially as the mere charge of the plagiarism of parts, would have been extended to the whole. We are decidedly of opinion, that the high rank which Douglas holds among the stock pieces of the theatre, is owing in a great degree to the celebrity which it had acquired, before it was represented in London. We even think, that had it been originally offered to the London managers, it would have been rejected; for it possesses none of those boisterous incidents, which are supposed by them, to be essential to tragedy. Indeed the interest depends so much upon the merits of the dialogue, that the stage is more naked throughout the performance of Douglas, than in that of any other tragedy in the language. The proprietors of the Rejected Theatre, therefore, conceive, by regularly furnishing a series of rejected plays, that authors, at last convinced of the smallness of the chance of getting any composition represented in London, will have recourse to the provincial theatres; and that in time the great audience of London, will become the arbiters of the poet's merit, as well as of that of the performers, without being obliged to endure the bald disjointed chat, which has so long been allowed to occupy the place of dramatic dialogue. If it shall appear by this work, that the pieces rejected by the managers, are in general as good as those which are successfully performed, the public will be enabled to judge how far the present system of management ought to be allowed to continue; for, admitting, that the expediency of continuing the monopoly may be justified, which, however, we do not think possible, it must still be granted, that some alteration is requisite, in order to accomplish that reformation in the British drama, which the public have a right to claim. We are little disposed to admire any thing French, especially in what relates to the consideration of public rights and popular interest, but still we must acknowledge that the mode of accepting and refusing plays at Paris, is greatly superior to what it is in London; and we think that if the monopoly of the stage must be continued among us, the public ought to obtain an alteration in the system, as far as relates to the authors. In Paris, the managers have no voice, as managers, in the approval or rejection of pieces offered for representation. The author presents his drama, with a list of the actors for whom the characters are in his opinion best adapted, and when the piece is read in the green room, the actors, severally, give their opinions as to whether it ought, or ought not, to be accepted. But in London it is not known, by whose taste or judgment the plays are approved or rejected. The public will derive another advantage from the establishment of âThe Rejected Theatre,â if the undertaking meet with that encouragement, which an undertaking so greatly national deserves. It will enable the world to see how far the modern dramatic genius of England is barren, as well as inferior. For the million of London being restricted to two theatres, it so happens, that for weeks, nay months together, the same pieces are repeated, by which the very essence of amusement, variety, is almost banished from the stage. It is alleged, that this is owing to the popularity of the plays or of certain performers, in particular characters; but we do not think so. It is more owing to the want of competition. Few plays have of late years been performed, to which any lover of the drama has returned on account of the merits of the piece. But, until the crowd is successively satisfied, the lovers of the drama must abstain from their recreation, or run the risk of being satiated with a monotony of dullness. Should there be no limitation to the number of nights which the same play may be annually repeated, since the public have but two places of dramatic entertainment, to which they can resort? We may frequent what tavern we please, reside where we choose, read what we will; but in our amusements we must be slaves to the patentees of Drury Lane and Covent Garden, as if the pecuniary accidents by which those gentlemen became the arbiters of the dramatic art, conferred on them any inclination to study what was most agreeable to the public, while they are actuated solely by motives of personal emolument. We have, it is true, no better assurance for obtaining excellence in any thing, than by leaving it dependant on motives of private advantage, and the managers of the theatres, as much as any other traders, no doubt feel the influence of this principle. But what we maintain is, that they are not incited by the spirit of emulation; and that the inhabitants of London have no greater chance of being well served by having only two theatres, than the strangers would be, if the law had decreed that there should be only two hotels for their accommodation. If we expect excellence in the performances of the theatre, we must subject the interests of the patentees to the effects of competition. It is very extraordinary that, although the frequenters of the playhouse are probably as numerous as those of the established church, and that, although, of one kind and another, there are probably as many theatres in the kingdom as there are members of parliament, no law has yet been passed, or even proposed, for regulating this important branch of domestic polity. To what cause, in so enlightened a country as England, are we to attribute the neglect of so great, so general an institutionâan institution, perhaps, as essential to manners in a refined state of society, as the church itself is to morals? The stage has, in England, become almost as great an organ of public instruction as the pulpit. Is it proper that there should be no law to regulate what is taught from it, except the notions of one obscure solitary individual, the reader of plays in the Lord Chamberlain's department? It would be better if some of those who are so loud and vociferous for alterations in the state of the government, would look a little more to their private trusts; and evince that they really possess some capacity for directing national affairs, by the judgment and liberality with which they promote the interests of the dramaâa department of domestic Åconomy which has more permanent influence on the character of the nation, than the measures of any administration, and which, in a moral point of view, is infinitely more dignified and important than the objects of half of all the questions annually discussed in the House of Commons. When a third theatre was projected some time ago, a dirty and fraudulent trick was practised for the purpose of deluding the country into a belief that the undertaking was not wanted. A paper was published, containing a list of the London theatres, by which it was made to appear that there were no less than thirteen, capable of containing about thirty thousand spectators. We ask every man of taste in the metropolis if this be true. We ask even Mr. Whitbread. That there are thirteen public places, to which the inhabitants occasionally go in quest of amusement, we do not deny. We know, indeed, that there are not only thirteen, but that there are thousands; for we will not allow that the stuff and trumpery which is nightly despised by the successive visitors to almost every one of the places named in that list, deserve more to be regarded as legitimate dramatic entertainments, than the jollity and junkettings of the ale-houses. On the contrary, we do most seriously and conscientiously believe, that there is more humour, and as much elegance of dialogue, to be met with at the latter, as there is either to be heard, or hoped for under the present system, in the performances of the former. Let permission be given to the proprietors of all the thirteen places of resort, honoured with the name of theatre, to exhibit whatever they please, and we shall cease to regard the public opponents of the third regular theatre as influenced by selfish motives. That several of the minor houses have attempted to introduce the regular drama, is a notorious fact; and the inference from it is conclusive. For their attempts were founded on observations deduced from experience. They felt that the senseless shows which they had been in the practice of exhibiting, were not relished by the public, and saw that the regular drama was, after all, the only sure source of emolument in theatrical speculations. Are not such surreptitious endeavours to encroach on the monopoly of the other theatres, a decisive proof, that the public taste is not to blame for the substitution of monstrous goblins, and roaring madness, in the place of the natural spectacle, and colloquial poetry of the drama? When we are told by the mechanists, and artists of the great playhouses, that the public taste is so depraved, that only shows and pantomimes can hope for success, let them also tell us, why those houses which were established only for such exhibitions, have endeavored to abandon them, and why those speculators who believed in the corruption of the public taste, have been prosecuted for attempting to retrieve the consequences of their expense on shows and pantomimes, by the revival of the regular drama? The persecution of the proprietors of the Pantheon, has produced a sensation on the public mind more conducive to the emancipation of the stage, than all the complaints of disappointed authors. It has contradicted, beyond all power of equivocation, the improbable assertion, that while the public had grown more enlightened in every thing else, it had become more barbarous and foolish in its amusements. It has decided that the bellowing and sleights of carpentry and coloring, which form the grand characteristics of the modern English stage, are really despised by the British public. It has established this truth, that the theatrical monopolists conceive themselves to have an interest in withholding rational dramatic entertainments from the public! But while we thus distinctly state our opinion of the present mode of managing the literary department of the theatre, in justice to the managers we should add, that we do not agree with those authors who complain of contemptuous treatment in the rejection of their plays. We cannot conceive the managers to be actuated by any insulting disposition, and when they send back a piece with a laconic note stating, that they are of opinion it would not succeed in representation, they, undoubtedly, only follow a general official rule, which they have found it convenient to adopt. It is very true, that the expression might be less seemingly arrogant, and that it would be more palatable were they to say that they thought the piece would not serve the interests of their concern; thus avoiding the ungracious appearance of censorial presumption; but the essence of rejection would still continue the same. Whatever is established as a general rule, ought never to be felt as particularly applied. It is not to the terms in which the refusal is couched, that offence should be taken; indeed we do not see any cause for personal offence at all. But that there is something in the mode of judging plays without submitting them to the green-room, and which ought to be altered, we think is indisputable. At the same time, we also think that were authors to offer their productions, in the first instance, to the provincial managers, they would have a better chance of being treated, more according to what they fancy themselves entitled to, and run less risk of disappointment in the event of obtaining a representation. Surely there is no dramatic author who would not think the applause of a Bath, a Dublin, or an Edinburgh audience, a great step towards distinction. In our opinion, the audience in those cities are greatly superior to the inhabitants of London, in dramatic taste; for the standard of excellence is higher in the provinces than in the capital, owing to this simple and obvious causeâThe provinces see only the best of the metropolitan entertainments, and are wholly untainted with the effects of witnessing the ordinary and condemned. The inhabitants of London, in judging of mankind, have, doubtless, some superiority over those of the country, but this very knowledge, which enables them to discriminate the motives of action with more acuteness, impairs the delicacy of the mental tact; and the mortification which most of them secretly feel on comparing their sense of the moral sublime and beautiful with that of their country friends, should teach them in matters of taste, particularly in what relates to the living representation of human actions, to be less confident in their judgment. If dramatic authors were sensible of this, before seeking to gain the profitable applause of the metropolis, they would endeavour to merit the honorable esteem of the provinces. How many of them would thus avoid the contempt to which they expose themselves, by seeing their essays exciting disgust at the first appeal! How many of those who, probably in consequence of the failure of their premature conceptions, have abandoned the cultivation of their talents, would perhaps by a gradual progression from the provinces to London, have attained fame and fortune from those very persons who could not endure their crude effusions! The public has no sympathy for the mortifications of authors. On the contrary, there is no other unhappy being supposed to be a fair object of ridicule, but a disappointed poet. If authors could once be convinced that, notwithstanding all their own fine sayings about laurels and immortality, they are in fact but tradesmen; or if the epithet be less disagreeable, but a class of artists dependant on the wants and inclinations of the public for all their consequence, they would soon acquire some of that consideration which they claim, and which may perhaps be due to them. Could they be inspired with a portion of that spirit of incorporation, that fraternal spirit, by which the booksellers and players have become their masters, and could they be taught to act simultaneously, they would not fail of obtaining that influence in the community, from which their jealousy of one another is the cause of excluding them. At present, authors, as a body, have no political consideration. There is no reason in the nature of things, why they should remain so. How does it happen that painters and sculptors are so much more important in society than literary men, and in England form a tribunal, whose awards guide the government and the legislature in matters of art? Is it not owing to their incorporation? Is the nature of authors so much more mercurial than that of painters and sculptors, that they cannot be incorporated? Would the institution of a literary academy do nothing towards the reformation of the stage? If such an academy were authorised to select the dramas offered for representation, would the arrangement not be more suitable to the dignity and importance of the trust, than that the power of licensing plays, should rest in an individual, a whole year of whose talents and merits is not thought worth half the value of one night's performance at Covent Garden theatre? Had the claims, of âThe Rejected Theatreâ to public patronage, been founded on the exertions of those, who are interested in its success as a publication, that patronage would have been solicited with more diffidence. But this is not the case. The proprietors are only affording an opportunity for talent to manifest itself, and for mortified genius to appeal to the public against a sentence from which there is no other appeal. Their share in the merits of the work is absolutely nothing. They have only constructed a building, and opened it to the poets and to the world. In doing this they are actuated by a great public motive, and they are confident that the public will support them. By their success a reformation must inevitably ensue in the exhibitions of the stage, and the most dignified of all the amusements of polished society will necessarily be improved. Diffidence in such a cause would be affectation. They expect the authors of rejected dramas to furnish them with materials, and the lovers of the drama are too sensible of the benefits that must accrue to themselves, not to grant a degree of encouragement that will rather induce the proprietors to extend, than to renounce their undertaking. Nor do they fear that the liberality of the public will on this occasion be contracted, and the ultimate utility of the work estimated by the compositions in the early numbers. It must be obvious to every candid mind, that at first the materials are necessarily limited to the communications of private friends, and that unlike every other publication, The Rejected Theatre may be expected less deserving of patronage, at the beginning than after it has been some time established. The work is formed with the hope of effectuating some reformation of the English stage. Its merits will depend on the voluntary communications of dramatic authors, and to deserve them it must receive the indulgence, and share the wonted generosity of the public.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. Since the publication of the motives which induced the proprietors to establish this work, it has been often suggested to them that their object would be more effectually promoted, were they to allow the insertion of plays which have not been offered for representation: for there are many dramatic writers who abstain from applying to the managers, and others who, although they have had plays rejected, continue to prosecute their study of the art without any expectation of theatrical patronage. As it is the wish of the proprietors of the Rejected Theatre to render it, in every possible way, a vehicle for bringing forth talents, at present unknown, and by this means to promote the Reformation of the Stage, they have enlarged their plan accordingly. They have seen, with regret, that some persons who affect to be interested in the property of the playhouses have been attempting, through the medium of the newspapers, to represent the Rejected Theatre as directed in spleen against the managers. They did not expect such a return for an attempt to render the stage more interesting, and, consequently, thereby to improve the mercenary speculations of those sort of persons: but it is impossible to provide against the misconceptions of folly and ignorance. They expect that their readers, and even the managers, as well as the actors, will do justice to the liberality of their plan and motives.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Gate of a town seen at some distance. Isbel. Alone. Isb. Again the annual morning of my loss, Brings all anew the loneness of my doom! Again the sun, sole witness of the blow Which left my husband, on this cursed spot, A bloody corpse, looks on the murd'rous earth, As if he saw the undivulg'd assassin, And kept his bright and searching eye upon him 'Till Justice come and seize. But nineteen years Have drearily their dismal round completed, Since the red horror of the crime was done, And yet no chance to give suspicion scent Has Providence permitted to arise.â But though the mem'ry of my murder'd husband Has perish'd from all others' thought but mine, And from the unrequited villain's fear, Time still shall prove eternal Justice true, And vindicate the vigilance of Heaven. Wait therefore patiently, my widow'd heart, Wait and expect, nor mourn the outward change Which leaves me as a solitary wretch Left in some wilderness, whose drear horizon Is bounded by the sky. Th'embracing Heavens, That show a limit round the sandy wild And ocean's waste where never coast was known, Gives to the faithful and religious eye Th'assuring sign of providential care. And in my lone estate, my widow'd loneness; I still have found its sacred aid attend. Yes! as the ravens fed the prophet's need With watchful constancy, still on this day It ever sends the gen'rous Glanville here;â And he will come, though his accustom'd hour, (Alas, the hour on which my husband fell) Be long gone by, and the sun near on noon. [Enter Reginald.] Come, Reginald; where is thy father, youth? He has not, as his wonted custom was, Been here to-day. Surely he cannot fail To think that always annual on this day, He came as faithful as the sun himself, To soothe my sorrow with his gifts and pity. By this good constancy of kindness, he Hath made a compact that he should fulfil. Reg. Thou art offended, Isbel. Isb. I have cause, For never bond on legal vellum seal'd, Gave stronger confidence to expectation, Than his successive visits gave to me That I had still a friend.âIf he be honest, He will fulfil the compact he has made, Nor balk my rightful hopes. If he do not, I will a grievous penalty exact. Reg. Nay, be not thus so heady and so wild, Thou shalt not lose thy stated gift to-day. Isb. I know that this day cannot pass unnoted. It is an anniversary that Heaven Doth make the holy angels keep with awe, âNow looking down from their celestial seats, Upon this cloudy orb of blood-stain'd men, All wond'ring gaze to see what may befall. But nineteen times they have the vigil kept, And saving still some new distress to me, Fate's dreadful purpose thickens unreveal'd. Reg. But to our house it has been deem'd propitious, And ever mark'd by prosperous events. Isb. Yes, still on it, I know, some bounteous chance Repaid thy father's charity to me. But, gentle Reginald, should he not come:â For, as the fortune of your father's house Has been advanc'd as he prov'd kind to me, Shall it not fall again at his remissness?â There is som secret tie between our lots, Which strangely seem in adverse scales oppos'd; Methinks, the scales of providential justice! And when the one ascends, the other sinks. âFrom that unhallow'd and unguarded hour In which my husband was so grimly slain, I have beheld the tide of Fortune set With a strong current that advanc'd your father, Leaving me ebbed far upon a shoal, Where nought presents itself to all my view, But the white bones of a poor mariner, Who in the dead defenceless hour of sleep, Was by some dark and undiscover'd foe, Cast from the shipboard down into the deep. Blood will have blood, and Heaven heard Abel's cry. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A room. Ariette and Glanville. Glan. Why looks my Ariette so sadly pale? Ariet. The solemn magic of this poet's verse Enchants my spirit into pleasing wonder, Tinctur'd with holiest awe. His every thought Hath, like the halo round the sainted head, A heavenly and religious intimation. Glan. What is his theme? Ariet. A rude pathetic tale. How a poor damsel, hopeless died in sin. Her mind was tender as the lacy film, Woven at morning in the hawthorn blossoms, And deck'd with gems of dew, which the soft gale That breathes but fragrance, or the gentler stir Of the fond linnet nestling with her young, Shakes from the weeping boughs. Oft as the moon, Round, full, and golden, fac'd the glowing west, An evil spirit, faithful to the hour, Came with persuasive dreams. Long she withstood His soft seduction, and with flowing eyes, That glimps'd like dew-drops in the moon's chaste light, She pray'd her guardian angel to be watchful. But there are times, as the sad poet sings, When our celestial guards go up to Heaven, With their account of that which we have done, And in the interim, the unguarded hour, Few can resist the instigating fiends. Glan. Alas! 'tis even so! Ariet. Sir, you seem mov'd! Glan. There's an infection in such mystic tales Which taints the heart with strange infirmity. Read them no more; take books that treat of life, The mind soon sickens that still feeds on verse, The fruit of thriftless and distemper'd brains. All the endowments of the Poet's mind, That rich effulgence of bright-tinted thought, Which wakes thy wonder, and inspires delight, Are bred by ails in his corporeal frame, As the gay glories of the tulip's flower, Spring from disease engender'd in the root. Ariet. You do amaze me, Sir. Never before Did you forbid me, but was wont to praise That subtile tact by which the Poets learn Th'inscrutable affinities of thought; And by some happy combination raise Delicious pleasure from afflicting themes. If this sweet Poet be not an inspir'd, Surely fond nature, in some beauteous error, Did reckless frame for such a world as this, A mind so inexpediently fine. [Enter Reginald.] Glan. Ha, Reginald, you look amaz'd. Reg. Alas! You have neglected your accustom'd visit To the poor maniac at the city gate. Glan. It is again the day! Reg. She waits impatient, Claiming the boon that you were wont to give As due to her by some dread compact made, And vowing vengeance if it be withheld. Glan. She has, indeed, poor wretch, just cause to claim; And I did fail in an imperious duty, When I forgot the hour, th'unguarded hour! Ariet. Ah, you have caught the Bard's romantic thought, Your guardian Angel has been then away, Else had you not so err'd? Why do you sigh? Glan. That I should suffer such a breach of mind As to forget the desolated woman, Whose only claim in life is strong on me.â Methinks I have a desperate forfeit made. What did she say? you say she threaten'd, what? Reg. 'Twas aimless boding, like the foul black bird, That, perch'd upon the chain-hung murd'rers head, Croaks hideous and unutterable things. Glan. Ah! [The sound of a trumpet heard. Ariet. Hark! Glan. Again!â Ariet. What means that doleful sound? Reg. It is the trumpet of the Magistrates, As they proceed to greet the Judge's entrance Into the town. Ariet. Sad signal to the guilty. Reg. You will be late for the procession, Sir. Glan. I do forget myself. I am too late. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The gate of the Town seen at some distance, as in Scene I. Glanville, an Advocate, Magistrate, &amp;c. Mag. Let us stop here. It is the wonted spot Where ancient custom and our charter says, We must do homage to the King's vicegerent, And ask for Justice in the name of Heaven. Glan. A little fartherânineteen years have pass'd, Since we were wont to meet him at this place, He may expect us, where we met last year. Adv. It was a breach in your feudalities To change the place. Mag. True, Sir, but the sad cause Which chanc'd upon the morning of the change, Gave us some warrantry. Adv. You did amiss So to entrench on old prescribed tenures. What was the cause? Mag. Upon that solemn day, A hideous murder was committed here, Whereby the ground was foul with clotted blood, And most unfit for our solemnity. The circumstance I do not well remember, But Glanville may. Glan. Why, Sir, should I? Mag. For you have ever with most constant kindness Aided the widow of the hapless victim. Alas, poor wretch! Grief has diseas'd her wit, And but for him she were indeed forlorn. Adv. I did observe her once, 'twas near this place, And she appear'd so gaunt, and curs'd with spleen, Blear'd in the eye, and blasted in the visage, That all the reverence due to age forsook me, And, as I look'd on her, methought her figure Prov'd that the mind, and the external frame, Fail, fade, and wither in companionship. Could we but see, thought I, the soul of age, We should a plain and true accordance find In its affections with the alter'd features.â The sharp and harsh projection of the bones, Demonstrate pride and stern relentlessness; The rheumy eye, wan Envy's master feature, Proclaims the spite that grudges youthful pleasure; The downward look evinces sordid thoughts, Searching the very dust as 'twere for geer; Th'trem'lous voice and shaking head denote A graspless heart that hath forgone all love, And hieroglyphics graven on the brow, Long use of pityless arithmetic. Glan. Forbear, young man! such fancies but insult The course and purposes of Providence. What though poor Isbel hath outliv'd your pity, The time may come when you yourself shall know, That e'en the power to pity quits the heart. There is an epocha in human life, When all men find their sympathies extinct. In some the change by wayward fortune wrought, Falls in the prime and vigor of their days; But with the general throng of daily minds, The wintry solitude of age prevails, Before that sear and withering of the heart. Adv. What causes think you, Sir, produce this change? Glan. Sometimes the canker of ingratitude, Gnaws out the fruitful germ of tenderness; When, as the stifling ivy climbs the tree, Barren misanthropy invests the heart; Sometimes the blossom of our vernal hopes, Like the bright hectic of a fated fair, Allures to disappoint: When it is gone, We have no courage to expect again, Nor ever love aught worthy of a tear;â The vampire vice too drains the bosom dry Of Nature's kindness. But much more than these, Is conscious guilt pernicious to our feelings, Turning each thought, yea, ev'ry corporal sense, All into one quick sentinel of accusation. Hark! [a trumpet heard. Adv. 'Tis the trumpet of the judge. Glan. He comes. Mag. On you the task to give him welcome lies. Glan. Let us advance then. Mag. Sir, it must be here, This is th'appointed place. Why should we move? Glan. You are peremptory. Well, be it here. Adv. He cogitates a speech. Mag. Stand back. Adv. The Judge. [Enter from one side the Judge attended. Isbel comes in at the same time from the other.] Mag. His Lordship waits for us, Sir; give him welcome. Glan. By old enactments of our ancient kings, We are commanded, on this fatal spot, In heaven's dread name to bid the judges enter, And deal us justice without fee, or fear, Of monarch or of man. Within our burgh, Not in the King's, but in the name of God, Tremendous Justice mounts her awful throne; And Providence, as fam'd traditions tell, Hath frequent there stood witness at the bar, Confronting perjury that would destroy, And proving guilt when far beyond all trace, The links of human evidence had fail'd. Therefore, my Lord, in Heaven's dread name we ask Your righteous ministration.âIsbel, here! Jud. In Heavens dread name we do accept the trust. Isb. [aside] 'Tis he, 'tis he that did the deed of death. Jud. What is that woman, who with such a shriek Of thrilling exultation, mars the course Of our appointed high solemnity. Adv. A wretched maniac. Jud. Send her away. Glan. Retire, good Isbel, you disturb our rites, Pray thee retire, you do offend the Judge. Jud. Give me the list of all who are accus'd. Mag. 'Tis here, my Lord. Isb. It wants, it has not all! Jud. I know thee now. Alas, unhappy creature! How long shalt thou the same sad note repeat? For many a year, still as the list was given, She has this melancholy protest made. Who is accus'd that is not in the list? [To Isbel. Isb. Glanville. All. Glanville! Jud. Of what is he accus'd? Isb. Murder! All. Murder! Isb. Secret and long conceal'd. Jud. Say, who against him brings this dreadful charge. Isb. I do, my Lord! Adv. Woman, get thee away. Jud. Let her alone. Adv. She is a maniac. Jud. Still must her accusation be receiv'd, It was for such as know not how to claim With legal form and advocated plea Redress of wrong, that we in public here, Receive the list of all accus'd delinquents; If to the list exception be not made, The guilty unaccus'd henceforth are free. Glan. She ne'er, my Lord, suspected me before. Jud. Nor any else, but only did protest, Asserting Providence would prove the charge. Be not so mov'd, Sir, at this wild conceit, Though charter'd law compels us to admit it. Isb. Justice, Justice, in Heaven's dread name remember. Glan. It was, my Lord, a settled custom with me, Upon the annual coming of this day, Which still has been in all my life auspicious, To bear myself a small benevolence To this poor widow, as she mourning sat Here on this spot, where her lov'd husband fell; But by some lapse, some breach in my remembrance, I did to-day neglect that stated duty, And for the failure she in spite accuses. Isb. No, not for that, no, not for that, my Lord! Though by his punctual regulated kindness, I thought he had a compact made with me As sure as that which Heaven holds with the earth, To give the reaping and the fruitage time. And when he came not, I did think, 'tis true, That he incurr'd, for the default he suffer'd, A dreadful forfeit which I would exact, But then I knew not that my words of passion Were prompted by an oracle divine. On to the hall and mount the seat of Justice. Glan. O thou vindictive and ungrateful witch, The source of kindness backward flows in thee, Or thou would'st never recompense me thus. Had she, in envy of my prosp'rous fortune, Which on this day did always richly shoot With new luxuriancy of fruit and blossom, Revil'd my life and scoff'd at my success, I had not rued the pity that I felt. But this accurst, destructive calumny, Sinks to my heart like a malignant drug. The venom that the viper Envy spits Hath not the power to injure Virtue's ermine, But calumny from those that we have cherish'd, Is as a cruel and deep-searching acid, Which takes at once something away, and leaves An irremediable blain behind. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCENE I. An ancient Apartment. Judge and Magistrate. Mag. Full nineteen years have pass'd since it was done, And till to-day suspicion never glanc'd On any one in all the town.â Jud. 'Tis strange! 'Tis very strange! The man, you say, enjoys A blameless life and honorable name. Mag. He is, my Lord, a man of excellent worth, A magistrate, with ev'ry virtue grac'd, That can the magisterial state adorn. Goodness presides with him, Wisdom directs, And, hand in hand, Justice and Clemency Have ever brought Content with his award. Jud. What was his youthful character? I mean, Did he partake the revels of the gay; Or was he always, as you now describe, Sedate in pleasure and in action wise? Mag. In that my recollection does not serve; But I have heard that some time in his youth, As wilfulness betrays the sprightly young, He did with wild companions waste the night, And play'd rash pranks, as youth will ever do; But still as oft in penitence contrite, He like the ruing prodigal reclaim'd, And grew in time, what he has now become, A mirror and example to us all. Jud. Is he religious, pious in his humor, Or but like others, temper'd by the times? Gives he habitual tendance on the church, More for the usage than in holy zeal? Mag. In charity, my Lord, how may I answer? Who dare assign a motive to the mind, That is not seen in the fair aim of action? Jud. True, Sir. But that which I aspire to know, Is all within the scope of our discernment. I do but ask if in his piety He moves by stated and habitual rule, Or hath repute, as many others have, For earnest fits of high enthusiasm, With listless intervals of faded passion. Mag. 'Tis said, my Lord, if true or false, I know not, That he is prone to mystical devotion; And certain 'tis, he oft frequents the haunts Of those who let their wand'ring fancies range Amidst the darkness of prophetic dreams.â Jud. Th'accuser is the widow of the dead? Mag. She is, my Lord. Jud. And never once before Made this unhappy accusation? Mag. Never. Jud. Nor any other at a former time? Mag. It is to me a half-forgotten tale, For ever since I could remember aught, The wretched woman has been counted craz'd, And touch'd with arrogant fanaticism. All day she sits, muttering an uncouth plaint, Close to the spot whereon the blood was seen, And yearly as the fatal day returns, Though storm and terror ride the flying air, She, in her gown's effectless cov'ring wrapp'd, Stands at the gate, and with a ghost-like wail, Cries âblood has voice and Heaven heard Abel's cry.â Jud. A terrible conceit! Mag. What shall be done? Jud. He must be tried. Mag. My Lord! Jud. A charge is given. Mag. But on conceit.âIt is phantastic all. Jud. I hope it is, still on a charge like this, The law speaks out decisively. Mag. There is no evidence. So many years Have pass'd oblivious since the deed was done, That but for her delirious wretchedness, All trace and circumstance had been forgotten. 'Tis sad to think that Glanville's honor'd name Should be so sullied by a maniac's fancy. Jud. But simple often are the oracles Which the Great Wise doth sometimes deign to use, And in long hidden mysteries of blood, As dim a light has shown as dark a horror. The trial must proceed. But first desire The different parties to attend me here. I would converse awhile with them apart. SCENE II. The gate of the town, as in the first scene of the first act. Isbel and Ariette. Ariet. Lo, there the haggard Beldam moody sits, Gather'd with thought, as 'twere, into a knot; Her visage pressing on her clench'd right hand, While with the left she draws the elbow in, Nor rests it on her cross'd and cramped knee. There's no remorse in that grim attitude. But I will speak to her. How my heart fails! She hath a look so witchlike and so wild, That I would shun the glimpsing of her eyes With fears I know not wherefore. Hapless wretch. How strangely hideous, o'er that dark attire, Her loose grey hair in snaky wreathes descends, Veiling her breast, whose dried and wither'd lean Contains no fostering for tender pity. Isb. Who, or what art thou, that, so lovely pale, Dost wear the garb and semblance of the earth, With such a mild and heavenly gracious mien? Draw near sweet thingâWhy dost thou shrink away? Give me thy hand, and let me see thy faceâ Ha! Glanville's daughter! Wherefore comes she here? Would'st thou entreat me? Art thou not indeed The tempting devil, and hath ta'en the form Of that fair maid, to mar the work of Heaven, That I am call'd to do? away, avaunt. Justice, Justice! Look up! Seest thou nought there? Ariet. The sun is there. Isb. It is the eye of God. Would'st thou seduce me in his orbed sight? Get thee far from me. I defy thy wiles. Ariet. O thou most cruel, thou ill-minded woman, Surely some demon, hatch'd by an eclipse Of ev'ry blessing and benignant star, Hath turn'd thy thoughts to mischief and to sin, That thou dost think so wickedly of me. What direful Incubus, averse to truth, Hath gain'd possession of thy hideous self? For madness never, in its desp'rate dreams, Thought aught so monstrous and fantastical, As that of which thou hast accus'd my father; And now thou 'dst do another bolder sin, Aghast recoiling with well feign'd affright, To doom me innocent to stake and flame. Isb. What would'st thou here, if thou art as thou sayest? Ha! thou incarnated, what would'st thou here? Ariet. O look not on me with such eyes of dread. Stand not avaunt, nor with such horrent stare, Believe thou gazest on the sire of sin. Alas, I am indeed, that Glanville's child, Whom the foul imps, that prompt malicious thoughts, Have made thee in thine anger charge with murder. Isb. Be she the Ill, she hath no power on me; I am a tried and chosen instrument To work high purposes of Providence. As righteous Job was tried, I have been tried, And patient all the sore probation stood: I was a wife, a fondly cherish'd wife, I was a mother, and my smiling babes Hung like a garland wreathing me around: The birds sung merrily, my heart was glad, And glow'd to heav'n with silent thankfulness; When suddenly in that most happy hour, The solemn angel of destruction pass'd, And from the winnowing of his dreadful wings Blighting disease fell upon all my plants, And laid them in the dust. My eyes would weep, But the Lord gives and the Lord takes away: I knelt and prais'd his name. Then, even then, Did the dark Glanville strike the secret blow, That left me here a lonely childless widow,â But he that gives may freely take away: Blest be his awful name. Year after year, On this selected day, new sorrow came, Till all forsook me, and I found myself Brought to the last, the utmost verge of want. Think'st thou that this was but in casualty? And Heaven was studious to assay me so, Without some holy purpose? Ariet. Heav'n forbid. But why, O why dost thou so wildly think That purpose should be to destroy my father? A man the most unlike, yea most unfit, To do a deed so terrible as murder? Isb. I hold no questioning with Providence, In whose eternal universe of things, All ill is but th'unseemly root of good. Yes: that which to our narrow mortal scan Appears so shapeless, knotty, and obscene, With writhing worms and crawling grubs astir, Is the life's treasury of some fair tree, Whose fragrant boughs give shade and sheltering, Off'ring obsequiously their beauteous fruit. Ariet. What good can spring from my dear father's woe? Ah me, what bounty from my breaking heart? Is he not innocent? Thou know'st he is,â And but in anger made the accusation. O haste, recall the ill which thou hast said. Isb. It is a bloodhound that hath waited long Scenting its prey, and will not be recall'd. Ariet. What proof, what witness hast thou to adduce? Isb. He that commission'd through the gloomy void, The glorious angel, from whose wings of flame Were shook the stars that light the universe, Will send a witness to avouch the truth. Hear me, and then away. At ev'ry crime, Heaven hath two witnesses. Ariet. Ah, what are they? Isb. The injur'd and the guilty. Bloody here, Aghast with death, and looking up to Heaven, Lay the informing witness of the crime: The other is the murderer himself; And he will verify the dead man's charge. But see, they beckon me to the tribunal. [Exeunt. SCENE III. An apartment, the same as in the first scene of the second act. Judge. The thoughtful mind, reflecting on the past, Sees in the various issue of events, A latent justice working straight from Heaven.â Whate'er affects us, sleeping or awake, Compels some current in the sea of thought, That moves us on to action.âBy what chance Could this mysterious supposition rise, After the lapse of nineteen silent years? [Enter Isbel.] Isb. Justice, my Lord. In the Almighty name Of him that heard the blood of Abel cry, I make the dread demand.â Jud. Be calm, 'tis granted, The writ is issued, and without delay The trial shall proceed. But, Isbel, think, There is no witness, proof, or evidence. Isb. Ha! and has he who orders all things right, Born witness to me nineteen times in vain? âThe voice and testimony of mankind, With time, and place, and circumstances clear, Could not so prove the bloody Glanville's guilt, As my great demonstration. Jud. What is it? What nineteen times of witness do you speak? Isb. The anniversaries of that dire day On which my husband was so foully murder'd. Jud. Alas, poor wretch! What is that evidence? Isb. Give me the hearing, calmly, as befits Your high vice-gerency, and justly due To my distress and widowhood forlorn. I am, my Lord, an old woe-stricken hag, Whose grey hairs flutter in the winter's wind: And I am poorâa mendicant, my Lord, In the obscenest rags of poverty. Shrunk age, lean want, and slow-consuming sorrow, Have made me all so hideous to the sight, That the spare alms which but provoke my need, Are less in piteous charity bestow'd, Than in the sad surprisal to behold, A thing so miserable human still. I have outliv'd compassion, and to fee The advocacy that my state requires, Have only these salt tears. But yet, my Lord, I claim the rites due to the race of man. The mighty maker of all things that are, Judges, and kings, and laws, made me himself: Yea, from as old a date as he contriv'd The glory of the sun, he destin'd me, And I demand my just equalities. Jud. Alas, good Isbel, this is ravel'd speech. Thou art assur'd the trial shall proceed. Isb. Who is the judge? Jud. I am. Isb. My Lord! Jud. I am! Why shak'st thou so thy head, and wav'st thy hand? Isb. My Lord, my Lord, deal equally with both. This is a cause in which dread Providence Appears a witness. If you are the judge, Why am I question'd here,âin secret here? Jud. She has rebuk'd me well.âYou may withdraw, Till the appointed time of trial come. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A Room in Glanville's house. Ariette and Reginald. Ariet. Alas, dear brother, you persuade in vain. There's not a truth in holy writ more sure Than that around us, in continual strife, The ministers of good and ill contend. Oft have I seen in the calm summer noon, When silent butterflies, like silvery blossoms, Floated in sunshine, and the golden bee Sung as he woo'd the blooming yellow broom, Angelic wings gleam o'er the sleeping lawn; I too have noted at the close of day, When the bright sun has set in amber clouds, Tracks straightway to him, from all points of Heaven, Of airy agents, doubtless then recall'd; And while alone, late in my chamber, sitting, When all was dark without, within all still, Save that at times I heard the deathwatch tick, I have been conscious of some evil thing Hov'ring behind me.âBrother, Reginaldâ O what may chance, if Isbel's charge be true, And in the court a flaming witness come. Reg. Thou can'st not, Ariette, believe it true. Ariet. Is it not in the sacred volume told, That Moses' visage once so brightly shone With the reflected glory he had seen, That none could look on him till he was veil'd? And he was but a mortal man of clay.â How shall we then endure the burning frown, Of one commission'd from the Heaven of Heavens, For an Apocalypse? Reg. What dost thou mean? Ariet. Methinks I see him! Reg. Whom? Ariet. He's in the midst. Reg. Sweet Ariette, sister, hear me. O forbear, Nor gaze with such distraction in thine eyes. Ariet. See how around the startled crowd recoil, With glowing faces and uplifted hands, As if retiring from a rising flame. Reg. There's nothing here. It is but thy conceit, That fills with prodigies the empty air, Come, take thy hand, sweet sister, from thine eyes, And by their faculty aright exerted, This strange phantasma of unreal fear, Will vanish from thy mind, as dismal shadows Thrown in the sun's eclipse, fly at his clearing. Ariet. O would I were a flower that weeps but dew, Weeps without woe, and blushes without shame. Reg. O do not raise and drop thy clasped hands, With such a mindless gaze of deadly sorrowâ Speak to me, Ariette,âHear me, O cease! Ariet. What if the dead man's ghost itself appear, And with its clotted locks and gashy head, Glare horrible conviction? Reg. O help! help! help? [Enter Glanville.] Glan. What means this cry? O Ariette, my child! My gentle Ariette.âWhat has she heard? Inform me, Reginald. Ariet. Confess, confess, And save the world from such a visitation. Glan. Is there contagion in the maniac's madness? What is the visitation that she dreads? Ariet. If you are guilty, it will surely come. Glan. Come! what will come? Ariet. The witness. Glan. Who? Reg. 'Tis thereâ Ariet. Where, Reginald, where, where? Reg. O it is this, This dread of vision, supernatural, That scatters all her tossing thoughts adrift. Ariet. Did you, my father, murder Isbel's husband? Nay do not start, but answer if you did. Far, better far, it were at once to tell, Than dare the grim confronting of his ghost. Confess, confess, for lo! the officers, Come to conduct you to the fatal bar. [Enter Officers.] Glan. Had I not lost the sense of sorrow quite, My heart would swell, but it lies still and dead. Take her awayâand get her opiates. [Exit Glanville with Officers. Ariet. I will not go. I will attend on himâ Unhand me, Reginald, detain me not, Though I may perish like a film in fire, Before some gorgeous angel, bright from Heaven, I will the fate of this probation see. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. An ancient Apartment, the same as in the first scene of the second Act. Judge and Advocate. Jud. I have convers'd with her. Adv. Is she insane? Jud. Her mind is heated and fanatical, Wand'ring, but not astray. Adv. How tend her thoughts? Jud. Religion, justice, and enthusiasm, So mingle and amalgamate her fancies, That the effect is stronger on the heart, Than eloquence with reason will compact. Adv. What are her nineteen signs of evidence, That testimony borne by heaven itself? For Glanville still hath been a man esteem'd, Never suspected, but in all his life, Sustain'd with constancy a blameless name. Jud. But there are times, when the dire fiend of ill, Obtains sad homage from the wisest men. (Enter Magistrate and Glanville.) Mag. My Lord, the Prisoner. Jud. It wrings my heart That one so just, so prosperous, so honour'd, Should in the evening cool of a fair life;â All business finish'd, and enjoyment found, Be thus molested by so strange a charge. Glan. Alas! my Lord, such is the fate of man! When we have gain'd the resting time of life, And think ourselves from accident secure,â Save in the pastime of some evening game, Whose sober chances suit the pulse of age,â A daughter's frailty, or a son's dishonour; The spite of foes, or worse, ingratitude; Breaks on our quiet, like the whirling storm That lifts the sheltering thatch-roof from the hind, Quenching the desolated hearth within. And yet prosperity hath evils too: The constant smile of fortune on the great Destroys the sense and faculty of joy, Like the unclouded sunshine, that consumes The germs of verdure from the mountain's brow, And makes it bald and barren as the stone That wastes beneath the fetter'd convinct's tread. They little know the wayward heart of man, Who think enjoyment makes him loath to die. The luscious bowl Voluptuousness prepares, Is mingled with a fell and drowsy charm; And Pleasure's smiling blandishments are felt Like the caresses of a tender nurse, That fondly lulls her weary babe to sleep. Adv. This accusation troubles you too much. Jud. You look on life, Sir, too despondingly. There is no cause, I trust, for this dejection? Glan. I cannot choose, my Lord, but to be sad. My daughter, touch'd by this afflicting chance, Strays in her mind, and, as a blossom blighted, A sudden withering o'er her reason spreads. Jud. Does she too think the accusation true? Glan. She has been always, from her tend'rest years, Enchanted by the spells of mystic lore, And goblin tales of boding apparitions; Which in the grief of this unhallow'd day Have rous'd her fears to dread expectancies Of ghostly evidence and spectral proof. Jud. And if such awful things should beâ Glan. My Lord Jud. All times have heard, and piety believes, That there are agents in the world unseen, Who by some sympathetic power extract The deepest secrets of the closest breast. The fiery visage and the burning heart Of guilt conceal'd, are kindled by their touch; And we have heard how strangers from afar, Inform'd by spirits at the dead of night, Have told the names of secret'st men of blood. It is a fearful, strange coincidence, That your fair daughter should so wildly dread, In this terrific and mysterious cause, The hideous proof of visionary forms. Glan. Give you, my Lord, too, credit to the thought?â Think you that Isbel's phantasy is true? And must I cavil with a mad conceit, Bred in the chaos of a maniac's brain, Like a most strange creation? Jud. How? Glan. The thought To fix on me this ignominious charge, Hath sprung engender'd as by miracle. Jud. Have you, at any time, unheeding heard Her pray'r for alms, slighted her helplessness, Or chided at her importunity? Glan. Never, never! This gentleman can witness, That more than all the general town beside, Has been my constant and unwearied kindness. Mag. Nature, my Lord, in this has gone awry, And by a wonderful and dire perversion, Turn'd all the wonted sweet of gratitude, Into most bitter and injurious wrong. Glan. As stated as the dismal day return'd It still has been my custom to bestow, How ill-requited! on the poor insane Some gift of pity and of charity. Jud. Why kept you the remembrance of that day? Glan. My Lord! I had no cause, but my compassion. Jud. Doubtless you knew the widow's husband well. Glan. I did my Lord, a man of honest worth, But somewhat churlish in his speech, and prone To swell to insolence in argument. Jud. A man like many that we all have met, Whom one might fall in sudden quarrel with? Glan. He was indeed, my Lord. Jud. Do you remember His figure, and the manner of his garb? Glan. To every point of the last suit he wore. [The Judge motions Glanville to retire] Jud. Has the accuser come? Mag. Not yet, my Lord. Jud. [apart] It is a case that doth perplex me much. Why should he hold this faithful memory? All others, save the miserable widow, Have almost lost remembrance of the fact, But he retains the image of the man Fresh and unfaded!â [Enter Isbel.] Mag. Isbel comes, my Lord. Isb. Justice, my Lord! I will not be seduc'd: Tremendous and almighty Providence Makes me in this an honor'd instrument And dare I falter in my awful function? Methinks I see God's bright and lidless eye Beaming intensely on us where we stand. Justice, my Lord, I dare but ask for Justice. Jud. Patience, good Isbel, moderate thy thoughts: I do entreat thee but one word apart. Do you, distinctly, in all points of dress, Retain remembrance of your murder'd husband? Isb. Alas! my Lord, he ever stands before me. I see him now as he went forth to walk On that dire morning when his life was ta'en, âHis plumed cap is gayly worn askance, His coal-black hair, in affluent descent, Flows o'er his purple cloak.âA primer man, With frank and ruddy honesty of face, Treads not the carpets of the regal dome. Jud. His hair was black? Isb. Yes, like the winter's cloud That rests upon a mountain, white with snow. Jud. His cap, you say, he gaily wore askance? Isb. With a free boldness, not in vanity. Jud. His cloke was purple? Isb. Why is it, my Lord, That thus with trifles so impertinent, You sting my heart to the full sense of suffering? Ascend your seat and call me to accuse. Jud. 'Tis well. Come, gentlemen, let's to the hall. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A room in Glanville's house. Reginald and Ariette. Reg. Refrain, dear sister, from this eager suit; A few short minutes, and all will be done. Rest where you are, and when the trial ends, I will a speedy messenger dispatch, To bless you with the tidings of acquittal. Ariet. I will not stay,âI cannot rest behind. I burn impatient to behold the scene; And if I see it not, my fearful heart Will surely flutter from its mansion here. Reg. Alas! dear Ariette, so wildly wan You will but there the gazing crowd surprise. O try your native meekness to renew, Be in our father's virtue confident, Nor fear of prodigy will then alarm. Ariet. I can but only think of what may come, And the pent spirit in my heart dilating, Feels clung by agony, while we stay here. Haste, brother, haste.âLet us together go. Why thus detain me by the wrist so firm? O Reginald, thou false unfilial son, Wilt thou stay here while thy dear father stands, Upon the edge, the pinnacle of shame? All eyes that see him, look expecting thee. I am his daughter, and I will go there. The laws of man may other ties divide, But cannot part the chain of destiny, Which links the parent and the child for ever. I tell thee, Reginald, that I will go. Take off thy hands. Release me. Why is this? You think me mad, your eyes betray you do. Injurious thought, when I can be so calm. Nay, I will promise not to think of it.â No witness apparitional will come, They that expect such sights amaze themselves, With conjurations of their own conceit. Come, brother, come. Ah me, why do you weep? Believ'st thou, that our father did the deed, And that some hideous evidence will come? O Reginald! But let me dry these tears, Which so unseemly stand upon thy cheek? Sweet brother, do?âHence!â Reg. Stay, unhappy, stay. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Hall of Justice. The Judge, Magistrate, Advocate, Glanville, Isbel, and Spectators. Jud. With calmness now set forth the accusation. Isb. Nineteen long years agoâand on this day, The very birth and change-day of the moon, A day on which as you came here to-day, The King Justiciary open'd the assize; That hollow man of undiscover'd crimes, Did with an impious, destructive hand, Make me a widowâruin'd all my life, Pluck'd every pleasure of the Earth away, And left me withering, shelterless, and wild, As the bare tree which Heaven's afflicting flash, Has made so hideous and fantastical, That twilight travellers, as they pass it by, Are seiz'd with fear, and think unhallow'd things. Jud. What proof, what witnesses support this charge? Isb. Proofs sent from Heaven, and Providence itself. Every sad morning since the deed was done I've ta'en my seat, near where the trodden grass, With crimson blush reveal'd the secret sin; And annual as the dismal day came round, That pensive man, in seeming kind concern, Did visit me, and minister'd soft words, With frequent gifts, my sorrow to appease. Why is't, my Lord, that he was thus so kind, So punctual in his pity? Jud. To the point. Isb. And ever still, as regularly true, As the great Sun adorn'd that morning's sky, His life was mark'd by some high-priz'd advantage, Some valued fruitage of prosperity. But yet, while all his house resounded joy, Still would he from the festal throng retire, And come in contrite charity to me. Was it not strange that he did so, my Lord? Jud. Be circumstantial. Adv. Is this evidence! Isb. And still as often as his fortune florish'd, Some new deficiency in life I found. Adv. Alas! my Lord, how she perverts the signs, That Heaven itself gives of his innocence. Jud. She builds her accusation on the proof Of providential circumstance, and he Must meet the charge by similar appeal. Adv. It is insane conceit. Jud. Let her proceed. Isb. Yes, the just Heavens by order'd circumstance, Since human demonstration there was none, Have turn'd the issue of his Fortune still, To draw all eyes to this mysterious dayâ âOnce on the anniversary of guilt, That fatal day, a son was born to him, Yet while the mother weak in anguish lay, He left her, babe, and garr'lous gossips all, Rememb'ring me the wretch he made forlorn. Another time a kinsman proudly rich, Whose haughty and unrecognizing eye, Had never glanc'd on him or his, deceas'd, And made him heir to treasures passing name. Again upon that day, sequence to wealth, Came great emblazon'd honors from the King. âEach chance of prosp'rous fortune that he found, Still on that day befell. Jud. Then, wherefore, Isbel, Did you not sooner make this solemn charge? Isb. In that, my Lord, behold how Providence Doth work its purpose to the destin'd end. Still, though by custom, I was wont to look With thankful expectation for his coming, No thought of wrong, not one suspicious thought Arose within me 'till this day of Justice. As I was sitting at the city gate, When he with all the honor'd of the town, Came forth, as ancient custom did require, To bring you, as the King's vice-gerent, in;â This day, the only day he e'er neglected To bring his customary gift and pity;â I, wond'ring at his absence, as he came And greeted you with courteous salutation, Regarded him, I know not how, reproachful, At which, methought, pale terror blanch'd his face: He look'd at me, and then anon at you, And dread and trouble thicken'd in his eye;â Then did the proof of all that I have told; The nineteen annual visits; each success That crown'd his feature, and made fair his lot, Rise, like the first creation of the light, Surprising me with most entire conviction. Adv. Surely, my Lord, this is but as a dream, The empty vapor of a brain diseas'dâ We but offend the gravity of Justice In giving 'tendance to a tale like this. [Enter Ariette and Reginald,] [and remain on one side] Ariet. All is yet well, and nothing yet hath come, But, wherefore is this pauseâWhy do they wait? Do they expect?âAh, what do they expect? Reg. Hush, sister, hush, let us stand back, apart, See, the judge rises, do not so obtrude.â Jud. The proof, so far, by the accuser given, Is not sufficient. Adv. Proof, my Lord! what proof? Witness or evidence, there has been none: Therefore, I claim the prisoner's acquittal. Jud. But he is tried upon the ancient law, And may not claim release, till he has pass'd The solemn ordeal therein prescribed. Glan. What is it, Sir? Adv. Stand forth, and face the Judge. Reg. My dearest Ariette, in mercy rest, Press not so eagerly, nor look so wild. Jud. The charge against you, Glanville, you have heard, 'Tis built on circumstances, so obscure, That but for old traditionary wont, I should pronounce you free to leave the bar: But this the charter of the town forbids, Till you have here, in open court, requir'd High Heaven to verify the accusation, Or scaithless, suffer you to quit the Hall. Say, will you make this terrible appeal? Glan. If 'tis so ordered, I must submit. Jud. Kneel. Glan. Must I kneel? Isb. How pale he looks? Glan. What more? Jud. Make the demand? Ariet. No, father, father, no!â Glan. Alas, my child! Jud. Remove that gentle maidâ Sir, we attend: will you make the appeal? Adv. How full of horror is this solemn pause! Glan. If Heaven accuses me before this court, Send forth its witness, or let me retire. Adv. No witness comes. Jud. Who then is that? Ariet. Who? Where? Jud. Stand back, divide, and give him room to enter. Adv. Who is't, my Lord, who? where? what witness? which? Jud. Yon black-hair'd man who wears his plumed cap On his left templeâGive him room to come. Adv. I am amaz'd, my Lord, I see none such. Jud. Him in the purple cloak, you ruddy man. Isb. It is, it is my husband that appears! Glan. O God, O God, and doth his ghost arrive? Reg. My sister, O my sister. Adv. She is dead! The vital cord, with dreadful expectation Strain'd beyond suff'ring, suddenly hath snapp'd. Glan. âMy long deep-hidden misery of heart, Is by the heralding of Heaven proclaim'd In this stern visitation.âO my child, My gentle, innocent, sweet Ariette, But thou art blest, why should I mourn for thee? You, dearest Reginald, my blazon'd shame Will, like the taint of an infectious pest, From all esteem'd society excludeâ Yet wilt thou never, if preserv'd from guilt In that exclusion, half the anguish suffer, Which, ever torturing, gnaw'd thy father's heart: For let polemics to the end debate, When bliss or punishment results to man, Though safe from human law, the guilty feel, With the first crime the pains of Hell beginâ Pronounce the sentence, I await my doom. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOTE ON THE WITNESS. We are not acquainted with any drama in the English language, which resembles this piece, as far indeed as our knowledge extends; it is entitled to be regarded as an original composition. Yet the characters are not out of the course of nature, and the incidents, though possessing a deep superstitious interest, are in themselves so very simple, that they can scarcely be considered as inventions. It is the author's coloring which bestows on them all their peculiar dignity. The subject in itself seems almost incapable of dramatic situations. A man has been many years ago murdered by some unknown assassin. The occurrence is forgotten by every one except his widow and a gentleman of a most estimable character, who has compassionately assisted the poor woman from the period of her husband's death. In the course of the play, the widow, in a fit of momentary disappointment, accuses her benefactor of the murder, and by a singular train of metaphysical reflections the judge is led to suspect that the gentleman actually did commit the crime, and in consequence so works upon his imagination as to obtain a confession of the fact. How far the author has succeeded in managing with due effect this delicate attempt, the reader's feelings alone can properly appreciate. The design has at least the merit of novelty. The author has omitted to mention in what country the scene is laid, and the reader is left at a loss to understand whether the place is a real town, or, as well as the circumstances, fictitious. We are of opinion that the whole is an invention, contrived to afford opportunities for unfolding a universal principle in the human mind, and that the subject has no local reference, but is applicable to the process of every man's reflection and associations. In this respect the play may be regarded as a philosophical essay. Besides that of the main story, a minor interest is created by a development of the passion of fear on the character of Ariette. The passions, without doubt, take their complexion from constitutional peculiarities. The character of Ariette, though in unison with the tone of the composition, is, we apprehend, of too rare a kind to excite general sympathy. There is a degree of tenderness, a fragility of reason about her, beyond even what the general opinion of the world ascribes to the excess of sensibility in romantic girls. We are not sure that the author has failed in his delineation; but it will not be denied that he has painted a being that seems to be more for ornament than use in this world. She however serves to augment the interest of his drama. The character of Isbel is not only the most prominent in the piece, but, as a dramatic portrait, we think, unique. She is a mixture of religious confidence, insane enthusiasm, correct feeling, erroneous judgment, and acute observation, with a disposition to draw fanciful inferences; the effect of these contrarieties in combination is, at once, wildly impassioned and affectingly simple. Without such a character, the play would probably have been tedious, and yet the catastrophe depends less on her, than on the judge, who is represented as a calm dignified personage distinguished by a sedate sagacity more than by any of those emphatic qualities which are supposed to be indispensable to proper dramatic characters. We remember some years ago to have read in a publication called âThe Phantasmagoria,â a story which bore some resemblance to the catastrophe of the Witness. A person who had been accused of murder, being placed at the bar, appeared to be suddenly and strangely agitated, and enquired of the judge if a man could give evidence in his own cause. The judge suspecting from the tremor with which the man looked towards the witnesses' box, then empty, that he was under some superstitious terror, answered that it depended on the circumstance, and certainly in the present case he mightââThenâ exclaimed the culprit âI am lost for I see the man I murdered in the witnesses' boxâ. A story mentioned by Barnes, in his history of Edward III. has been pointed out to us, as probably the source from which the author was led to imagine the character of Ariette, and we think that the incidental circumstance alluded to in the second scene of the first act, was probably derived from Barnes, or some ballad founded on the story which he relates. âIt is reported,â says he, âthat a young woman named Joan, living in the parish of Kingsly, in the Diocese of Winchester and the Deaconate of Aulton, being on the fourth of June at night, advised by a voice to go and meet her sweetheart William in the forest of Wolmar aforesaid, early in the morning met with an Incubus in his shapeâat her return home she fell into a grievous malady, and then upon conference with her sweetheart William, it appeared that she had been seduced to her confusion by an evil spirit.â</field>
