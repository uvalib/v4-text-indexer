      <field name="fulltext">HAROLD A CHRONICLE PLAY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS Harold, an English Earl, afterwards King of England. William, Duke of Normandy. Gurth, brother of Harold. Lanfranc, an Emissary from the Roman See. Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury. The Sire de Mallet, a Norman Baron. Elfrida, mother of Harold. Edith of the Swan-neck, beloved by Harold. Githa, a wise witch-woman. Priests, Barons, Thanes, Couriers, etc.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Play is divided into four Acts, certain scenes being merely spectacular, to be presented, or omitted, according to the method of production. These scenes, if the drama be played on a grand scale, will lend picturesqueness to the story, but they are not vital to the drama itself. They occur as the first scene of Act I, the first scene of Act IV, the third scene of Act IV, and the last scene of Act IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I SCENE I (This scene can be omitted if necessary.) A starry midnight sky. In the foreground a tall, muffled figure, with back to the audience, seeming neither man nor woman. In silence two brilliant stars, rushing from opposite ends of the firmament, clash together in mid-space, making in their meeting an increased blaze of splendour. One falls earthward, the other continues its career across the vault in increased brilliancy. Throughout the scene there is unbroken stillness, but as the curtain falls there is heard, preluding Scene II, the roll of a dying thunderstorm, which continues during the change of scene, and intermittently through Scene II. SCENE II A chamber in a sea-castle of William on the Norman coast. William is gazing outward through the casement at the departing storm-cloud and a wreck-strewn coast. Lanfranc is seated busy with papers at a table. Enter courier hastily with dispatches, which he delivers to the Duke. William (surveying the papers). From England! [He signs to the courier, who goes out. He reads. Lanfranc! News here of deep note! Edward of England, ailing long, sinks fast. And for that English throne the dying man Hath given me his voice. [Lanfranc starts to his feet. Now, Lanfranc, listen! Crowned with that crown it is my dearest wish To bring this lawless, untamed, English horde Under our See of Rome: and to enrich These holy coffers, all too empty grown; If I go thither, then, I go for Rome As for myself to spread her sacred sway, A soldier of the Holy Father girt. [Lanfranc starting forward eagerly. Lanfranc. And on this errand chiefly am I sped. And here I hail thee, William, our dear son, Embattled for the true Church of the earth. To bring these wandering and wayward sheep Back to the fold and bosom of this world. Thou hast the sole authoritative voice Of him that even now is dying fast. Here is my mission ended! Wil. No! Not yet! Lan. Why! What can hinder now? Wil. One man alone. Lan. What man is this that can disdain the august, Dying command of him that makes thee heir? His name? Wil. Harold of England! He alone. Lan. But the King's dying voiceâ Wil. How shall it weigh Against the unanimous and rolling cry Of a whole people? Edward being dead, The living easily overwhelms the ghost. Full in men's eyes, dethrones a memory. Then, he is of the soil, an alien I. [A vivid flash of lightning from the departing storm suddenly reveals a breathless seaman, hastening in, followed by servants. Seaman. Harold of England, Sir, thrown on our coast In shipwreck: he is wandering in the search For hospitable shelter, and by now Cannot be far! Wil. (throwing purse to seaman who exits; to a servant, who lingers). Summon, and instantly, The Sire de Mallet. [Exit servant O Lanfranc, this no casual storm that burst Upon our coasts. This tempest with design Hath spent its fury thus. The Lord Himself Dispatched this lightning as a courier, A message to the bellowing thunder gave; He roused the sea from its uneasy sleep, Its very rage did execute His will. He found a dread employment for the surge, And to the tempest did He give a task. This uproar was commissioned from on high; Behind the seeming fury there was Fate And Wisdom in this welter: and the barge Of Harold with deep purpose here is flung Upon that hissing beach: I will attend This loud direction: [Enter Mallet. Mallet, before all, You have my trust. [Mallet bows low. Harold of England here Is cast in shipwreck and is wandering Unsure of shelter near our very walls. Take with you others and with ceremony Escort him hither. With our Norman grace Subdue suspicion in him: bring him fast! [Exit Mallet. I have him! Lanfranc, I will cage him here Most courteously, and detain him so In most polite imprisonment, till the voice Of Edward, holy from the bed of death, Ingratiate me smoothly to the throne. He is delivered to me by the storm. Lan. I like not this. I fear lest you offend The sense of Europe, which by you must be Most courted, and most delicately nursed; Less of the soldier then and more of priest. Let Harold be persuaded, ere he go, To swear an oath that he shall not oppose The voice of the dead man bequeathing you The crown of England. He shall take that oath Publicly o'er the concecrated bones Of famous Saints, [William makes an impatient gesture. and let it be conveyed To Harold that this oath is but a form To satisfy your too unruly knights And ever murmuring barons; yet perhaps Refusal may entail his further stay. Wil. (striding to and fro). Yes, yes. And if, his feet on English earth, With acclamation rolling in his ears, The throne so easy, within reach the crown, He shall abjure an oath so wrung from him? Lan. Then we invoke on him a holy war, Arm Christendom against a perjurer. A narrow quarrel betwixt you and him Now looms a menace to the Holy See! Europe shall thunder on a man accursed, Horsemen shall spur as to the grave of Christ, And London lure men as Jerusalem! No more 'gainst Harold, 'gainst a perjurer, The bow of God in vengeance shall be bent; The arrow of God shall strike him to the earth. [A trumpet is heard and an announcing cry, âHarold of England!â Harold strides swiftly into the chamber, his fair, flowing hair and flaxen beard contrasting vividly with the dark, clean-shaven Normans. He is followed by Gurth and others. Wil. Harold, I greet thee! Thou art welcome, Harold! Here I extend the refuge of our coast And thank the tempest that hath driven you here. Thou art in need of rest. Here rest secure. [As the scene closes the last thunder is heard of the departing storm. SCENE III A brief scene in a corridor of the Castle. Enter Harold hastily, in agitation, followed by Lanfranc. Lan. Sir, but a little thing is asked of thee. Har. An oath! Lan. A formal oath to pacify Not William, but his too unruly knights, For ever murmuring in discontent. An oath from thee that thou wilt not resist The claim of William on the English crown Will oil a troubled sea. 'Tis all we ask. The voice of dying Edward stands with thee, All-holyâdoth it not? Har. Holy it stands, And yetâ Lan. And yet? Har. Lanfranc, I have a doubt If I may disinherit not an oath; Who knows? The will of a whole peopleâThus, If I refuse? Lan. Thou art on foreign soilâ Kindly entreatedâyet on foreign soil. Refusal might induce a longer stay. Retract a while the exileânot by force, But to allow a pause for calmer thought, To weigh the consequence with stiller mind. Har. Oh, speak it out! We like not crooked ways And dark, uncertain speech in that free land Where I was born, and I am little used To wiles of prelates or the purr of priests. Give this its downright name; it is a trick To hold me here till I have sworn away A people's heritage; prelate, speak out! I am here a prisoner, in durance held. You would put bonds on me, and smile, and smile, Tie fast my hands, and smile, enmesh me thus With shoulder-shrug. The storm hath cast me here And William cages me, a shipwrecked man, Far from my friends, and sundered from my home. Lan. I say not that! Har. It seems that I am trapped. [Lanfranc ushers Harold off with soothing gestures. SCENE IV A ceremonial hall in the Norman Castle. The chief Norman nobles are assembled. William seated on a dais at the upper end. A chest covered with a gorgeous cloth is visible on the right of the chamber. William rises. Wil. Seigneurs and Lords and famous Chivalry, Edward of England at the point of death [Murmurs amid the throng. To me, your Duke, hath he bequeathed that throne And with a failing hand hath crowned this brow. Sirs, will you follow me to a fair land, Not barren soil as this our Norman earth, No sterile tilth where none may sow nor reap, But to a region rich with springing corn And yellowing wheat, where falls a prosperous dew, And all the isle thrives in benignant rain. No pasture there is niggard, none is bare, But all its acres, rife, and sweet, and rich, Yield plenty and abundance in the sun. Say, will you leave this leanness for that fatness, Sail with me from this desert to that sown, Out of this greyness to that greenness go? [Loud cries of acclamation from the knights assembled. None here I force; no one of you compel; If me you follow, follow with free will; I'll drag behind me no unwilling host, Or bribe to arms a sullen soldiery. There may ye grasp what falleth to your hand And wield a sway that is denied you here. Here we but gasp for room, are let confined; Out to an ampler, a more spacious field! Who then goes with me and who bides at home? [Again cries of acclamation and swords flash. As they stand thus with drawn swords, Harold enters with Lanfranc, Gurth and others following. Wil. (turning to Harold and taking him publicly by the hand). Harold of England, Sirs, our steadfast friend. [Pleased murmurs. He comes to take an oath before you all, A holy oath, that he, an English Earl, Will not oppose and will not disregard This my succession solemnly bequeathed. This, Harold, thou wilt do? Har. Sir, I have said it. Wil. And willingly, by no compulsion driven? Har. I yearn for my own land; then let me swear And go. [William makes gesture to Lanfranc, who advances. Lan. Harold, before these Lords convened, Assembled knights, I call on thee to swear As thou fear'st God and keep'st thy given word, That thou in no way wilt oppose or stay The due succession to the English crown Of William, Duke of Normandy, bequeathed And solemnly assigned from bed of death: Then lay thy hand upon this chest and swear. Har. Why on this chest? I will uplift my hand. Lan. It is our Norman custom handed down. Har. (laying his hand on the chest). Here then I swear and take this public oath That I in no wise will oppose or stay The due succession, solemnly bequeathed To William, Norman Duke, of England's crown. Lan. And thou dost abjure it, God deal with thee. Har. (after a pause, repeating). And if I do abjure it, God deal with me. [Lanfranc signs to a monk, who, uncovering and opening the chest, reveals within it the bones of the Saints. Har. (starting back). What bones are these that I have sworn upon? Lan. (solemnly). Harold, behold these bones of mighty Saints. [A deep thrill runs through the assembly, followed by silence. Not lightly hast thou sworn, no passing oath; These holy dead have heard thy solemn word. If then thou shouldst be tempted to forswear, Lured by the rabble-shout, thou shalt incense Now not alone the living, but the dead, And rouse to ire spirits in paradise. No voice of breathing man can now absolve thee If thou offend this unseen audience, Invisible, unforgetting witnesses. A damp already stands upon thy brow, Well mayst thou shake; what seemed but bones shall rise, They shall take flesh and quicken and stand up; Beware! Already they about thee throng. They fill the hall; see! see! They point at thee. I hear the solemn whisper of the tombs. Har. (reeling backwards; then commanding himself). But thou shalt scare me not, I swore indeed, But upon what I knew not. Lan. Thou hast sworn. Wil. (rising). Friend, I will not detain thee longer. Thou Art hot for England, our belovÃ¨d land. Harold, farewell! In England we shall meet! [William and his knights now retire in solemn silence; Lanfranc remaining. Lan. I leave thee, Harold, leave theeâto the dead. [Exit Lanfranc. Har. Brother, thy arm. [Gurth starts forward to support Harold. O Gurth! Gurth. What thou hast sworn Thou wast compelled to swear. Har. What other way? Here am I trapped, here like a lion rage, Meshed by the cunning hunter. Only thus Could I break free. Forgive me, England, then! If I have seemed to lay thee at the feet Of shaven smilers. (Suddenly, with change of tone.) Oh, wast thou aware Of any ghostly movings through the hall? Were those about us that we might not see? Did others hear me than those visible, Convened in awful cerements from the dust? Or didst thou hearâI will not say a voice, But even a whisper from those witnesses, Recording silent that unwilling pledge? Say, say! The panic breaks out on my brow In fearful dew; listen! Gurth. Command thyself! Art thou a soldier? Or art thou the son Of that fierce Godwin who ne'er quailed nor bowed? Summon the English blood back to thy heart! Man of the whirling axe! Art thou become The sport of mumbling priests? I see thee stand A-tremble from the mummery of monks. How shall they laugh in England! Har. Oh, to strike In mine an English hand again! I gasp, I stifle and sicken in this air! To feel The stinging salt-shower of the singing sea! To have in sight those cliffs for freedom pale! God! For the blowing winds and rolling downs! The good kind smoke a-curl from rural thatch! Noises of kine from fields in cloudy dawn! The rainy green of slopes where I did roam! The simple, blue-eyed folk that I have loved! To set the roar of waters between me And him; or stand against him axe in hand, Where never a shift shall staunch his Norman blood! Gurth. There Harold speaks at last! Har. And most to hold Again upon this bosom, over-fraught, My Edith of the Swan-Neck! In her ear To tell the treachery and the foreign guile! To England fast! Gurth (going). For England then! Har. (starting and hesitating). O brother! The lidâthe lid, didst see?âof yonder chest; Didst thou not see it raised a little, but no Hand that did raise it? Gurth. Ah! To Englandâhence! [Gurth strides out and Harold follows more slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II SCENE I A hall in the Saxon Castle of Earl Leofric, father of Edith; with a wide doorway at the back opened to the summer night. Harold is standing with a troubled countenance, Edith holding his hand. Edith. So my caged bird has fluttered back to me And to its nest returned? Har. Ah, in this nest, Edith, of thy sweet bosom I have been O'er-happy; back on me the trouble comes; Not even thy lips can kiss away that oath, No woman's voice can still that harsher voice That warned me of the vengeance of the dead. Edith. I love you, then what need to fear the dead? Must I be jealous, not of men, but ghosts? Be not dismayed by shadows. Here I stand, These living arms about you, and you feel This heart-beat; in that music let all go. Here is the true oath, not compelled by force; Freely to me you swore eternal faith, And from this pledge there is no going back, For you remember, Harold, that strange eve, When in that very garden, now moon-lit, The moon had not yet come; and all the world Trembled 'twixt dark and light, and the dew fell. And you remember, how in that dim air You clasped me in a sudden fierceness close? Thoughts struggled from us both, that ne'er were words, Longing too deep to trust itself to sound; A too great sweetness then did trouble you, While world on world stole out upon the dusk. That truth the stars did witness, not the Saints, The living stars; to that alone be true. There is thy anchorage and there thy haven! Har. Woman art thou all o'er. Edith. A woman, yes, But listen! From duty I would keep you not; Not even from battle would I hold you back. I'd let you go dry-eyed, and brave, and still; I would not dim your courage with a tear, Nor send you from me with a breaking voice; I am not of the stuff that weeps and clings. No, I would buckle you with maiden hands And make my lord all ready for the test, In gladness of the soul, though not of heart. I am not jealous of this land that loves you, I'd hold you not from England; but by this Extorted oath I will not see you bound. I say to you: abjure it! Is there not A wider honour than is that of priests, A larger duty that makes glad the sun? All England claims you; hers the greater claim. Har. If this indeed were so! Edith. Indeed 'tis so. Can you not trust a woman's heart to see More clearly than man's brain? Men more should trust us; I do not speak of body-faithfulness, But in great issues, if we surely love them, Grandly forswear thyself. Har. My heart's with thee; But an uneasy conscience pricks me still. [There is heard a sound of approaching feet at the back, and the flare of torches illumines the night without. Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury, enters with a grave air and certain Thanes follow him. Stigand (standing in doorway. Two torch-bearers behind). The King is dead. [Harold starts forward. Stigand and others slowly enter, while Edith retires into the shadow, where she remains watching. I, the Archbishop, bear This heavy news to thee in the deep night. Harold of Wessex, though we mourn this death, This hour is with the living, not the dead. To thee we come, and we must know thy mind. With me are come from North, South, East and West Our chief of men: we come to make thee king. [Harold starts. During this interview the eager face of Edith is visible from the gloom. Listen! This is no moment for delays; We cannot tarry and we cannot pause To give dissension leave to raise its head At home, lest a distracted people meet The foreign menace, and, divided, fall. This people cries to thee, the only man, Our most beloved, our strongest, to stand forth, And not refuse to bear this heavy crown. There is no other; tremble not to reign. Har. Thou know'st the oath I swore on holy bones. Stig. I, Stigand, will absolve thee from a pledge So taken; public absolution give thee In Westminster and in all England's gaze. A Thane (holding his torch out towards Harold). Harold of Wessex, of old Godwin's brood, I look into thy face; do I see fear? [Harold starts wrathfully. What dost thou fear? Thou wast a soldier once; I never knew thee from the breach to flinch. What over-cows thee, man? Must we believe That thou dost shake at cowls of Norman priests? Bones cannot harm thee, holy though they be. Thanes, he will seek the cloister, not the field, We'll see him with no hair upon his face, Muttering with shaven lips a Norman screed. [Harold grasps his sword-hilt. Give me that sword and fetch a rosary. Harold the priest! Harold of Wessex, monk! [Low derisive laughter. Stig. Harold, I make no taunt; I summon thee To answer. In the name of all these Thanes Answer us: wilt thou reign? Thanes. Answer us! Edith (starting from the gloom). Reign! [Acclamation from Thanes. Har. (after looking upon Edith). Thanes, I will be your king! [Loud shouts and waving of torches; the shouts are taken up outside of âHarold! Our king!â Edith (throwing her arms about Harold). Harold! My king! SCENE II The Abbey of Westminster. English Thanes assembled in full armour; also a throng of people can be discerned, the leaders of whom are in the Abbey, the vast crowd unseen without. Sunset; the setting sun streaming through the stained windows. Harold is seated on the ancient throne-chair of the Saxon Kings on a dais, and under a canopy of gold. Above him floats the jewelled standard of âThe Fighting Man.â Stigand, Archbishop, richly vested, with attendant priests, now advances and speaks from the foot of the throne. Stig. Earls, Thanes and priests, and all ye people, hear! Behold, upon our throne Earl Harold sits, Called thither not alone by Earl and Thane, Nor priest; but by this people with one cry! [Acclamation. Now hear me, all of you. Harold, there sitting, Hath sworn that he in no wise will resist The claim of Norman William to our crown. [Murmurs of indignation. But knowâand as God's priest I speak to youâ That oath by Norman craft was wrung from him. [Angry mutterings. He, cast upon that coast, a shipwracked man, Had no way of escape, but by this way, If he would see again his native land. An oath, so taken, is no oath to God. [Applause. I therefore, in this church, before you all, Pronounce him solemnly absolved; that he Under no curse, a free man, be our King. [Loud cries. Here, Harold, inasmuch as thou didst swear Unwillingly, by force, this crown away, Absolve thee publicly in holy church. So I pronounce, Archbishop of this land! [Again a shout from those assembled. Say then aloud, remembering where ye stand, Will you have this man to reign over you? Let English blood cry out to English blood, Will ye have our man or the Norman Duke? [There is a loud shout of âYea, this man!â Swords are drawn and flash in the air. By these drawn swords speak, England, yet again, Will ye have Harold to reign over you? [Cries of âHarold! Harold our King!â Waving of swords. The cry is taken up without by the unseen multitude who are pressing inward on their leaders from outside. Stig. (receiving from a priest the cruse of holy oil). Then, Harold, in the sight of England I, God's prelate, here anoint thee English King! [He is about to anoint Harold, who has risen, when he is interrupted by a procession of Norman priests, whose leader, coming to the front, exclaims: Priest (to Stigand). Stay thou that impious hand! Harold hath sworn, And on the sacred bones of Christian Saints, That he in no wise will resist the claim Of William, Norman Duke, upon the crown! Hear now, ye English people, if this man Break oath, and stand a public perjurer, Then shall reign over you a man accursed. [Gradual silence falls heavy on the assembled throng during the speech. Nor this alone: but ye yourselves shall stand A people perjured-cursed; each man of you Henceforward is forsworn, as is your King. Your very corn shall rot, your fields decay, And all the land shall moulder like the grave. Upon you shall descend from utmost shores Armies to pillage, devastate and burn; And hearken to me now with trembling knees; The Saints in anger shall invade your air, The very grave a buried host dispatch. Tempt not the vengeance of offended Saints! [Stigand starts forward as though to answer, but is stayed by Harold, who rises. Har. I, Stigand, will make answer to this priest. Back then to Norman William and say this: That thou hast seen all England gathered here To crown me king. My pledge to him he claims, But this whole people hath a larger claim. If I break oath, I break it nobly here; If I am perjured, grand the perjury, And if forsworn, rightly am I forsworn. [Assenting murmurs. Thou sayest our corn shall rot, our fields decay Through visitation of offended Saints; But I would sooner see our land so rot Than wither underneath the conqueror's heel! Strike then, ye Saints, but let no alien strike! There is the deeper blight, the worse decay! And as for foes, if we must fight, we fight, And, Norman priest, be thou assured of this: That if in bloody battle I go down, Yet never fate, nor ever curse of Rome Shall loose these English knees, or quail this heart. That Roman curse shall string this arm to steel, And very doom give edge unto this axe! Dying, I will be liberal in death, And with slain Normans will I sup in hell! Back to thy Duke; I this defiance hurl! [Loud shouts and brandishing of swords, with cries of âHarold our man.â The Priest. Woe to thee, Harold! [Angry murmurs. Woe to all this land! [He slowly departs with his attendant monks. Stig. Harold of Wessex, I anoint thee king! [He solemnly anoints Harold in deep silence and places on his head the crown. The Saxon coronation hymn peals out as the throng disperses; all but the chief Thanes, who remain to take the allegiance oath. A Thane (kneeling). Harold of Wessex, here anointed King, To thee do I devote my body, my land! [A Courier now rushes in. Courier. O King, grave tidings hear! Hardrada now Of Norway with a fleet lies off our coasts, And summons thee to yield him England's crown. Har. Six feet of English earth I'll yield to him, Or, seeing that he is a giant, seven. Scarcely the crown is set upon my head, When one starts up to snatch it. To the North! A helmet more becomes me than this crown. Friends, to the North! Thanes. For Harold, to the North!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III SCENE I A rude, half-ruined chamber of a dismantled castle in the North. In the light of torches the Saxon chiefs are supping and revelling. The two chief seats at the head of the table are vacant. The men have all the appearance of recent conflict, stained and dented armour and wounds showing upon them here and there. On the rising of the curtain, Harold and Gurth enter, followed by certain soldiers carrying spades and other digging implements. One carries a huge shield and another a huge sword. Harold. Friends, let these men have drink. They are athirst From burying of a giant. Deep he lies, Hardrada now: yet in our victory, Hard won upon the plain of Stamford Bridge, Forget we not the gallant dead we fought. The giant now hath that seven feet of earth I promised him. [Laughter around the board. See here his shield and sword! These mighty trophies will adorn the feast! And, friends, if I should fall, I look to have At least a reverend burying. Where I fall, If without tears and ceremonial rite, A kindly laying in the earth at least. [A silence follows Harold's words. But not to-night of burial or tears We think. I toast the field of Stamford Bridge! [All rise to drink, and when they sit, a chief, cup in hand, begins to sing an old Saxon war-ballad. The song at its end is interrupted by the entry of a mud-besplashed messenger. Messenger. Where is our King? Whence Harold? [He is beckoned by Harold. Har. Wherefrom, man? Messenger. O King! I am the last of many posts Furiously hither running from the South. William, the Norman Duke, already stands Upon our Southern beach; and with him comes A host so vast, no eye can see the end. [A deep silence follows on this; then, after a pause, a shout of derisive laughter. A Chief. Another come for burial! Another. Let him find A Southern grave, as he a Northern! Drink! Another. We ever were a hospitable folk, And entertain the strangers North and South! Another (raising cup). Confusion to the Norman and his priests! Another. More wine! And let the Norman stretch his legs About our coast awhile. Another. He'll know it better When we have done with him. Another. Drink on, drink on! Gurth (rising gravely). Thus I have set my cup down for to-night. [Murmurs. Break we the feast up! Let us drink no more. [Further murmurs. I tell you that the giant we have slain Here on the Northern moor had not the half Of dangers in him that this Norman hath. That shield was buckler of a brave, rough man Like to ourselves. In battle was his joy; War was his frolic both by land and sea. Far other he that comes upon us now; With deep dissimulation and with art He hath prepared him; and behind him brought The bristling chivalry of many lands, Who are embarked as in a holy war Against a perjurer; [Loud and angry shouts. count this man not light! What is our course? How best to fight him? A Chief. Have at his throat! Another. We'll have no priestcraft here! Gurth. Have at his throat, the very way he wants. Two or Three. Then let him have it; we are blooded now! Gurth. Patience! I would advise we concentrate On London all the armies that we may, Not rushing down on him, but biding still. So let him plunder, devastate and burn. With plunder and with spoil disordered thus His host breaks out of hand; distracted then Each by himself will snatch and fight his friend. Divisions, rivalries will eat them up! Then sudden on a lawless mob we fall, We, bound together, for our native earth. Remember, war is not mere shock of arms, Freedom alone outnumbers armies vast. Here let us bide alert, but not o'er-rash Untilâ [A second messenger rushes in. Messenger. O King! I am sped out of the South! The Norman ravages and slays and burns; Thy land is smouldering fast and homestead flamed! 'Tis panic everywhere, thy people fly. The foe spares not the mother nor the babe; He strikes and massacres, he spills and hews! Is there no help? To thee we cry aloud! Har. (rising angrily). And I will answer. [Acclamation and cries of âHarold.â Who will follow me? [Shouts of âI, I!â I will not see these things done in the land! Shall I sit here, or, as thou sayest, bide, While all these cries are ringing in my ear? This heart shall answer to the Norman brain! I, I am burned, I stifle with the smoke Of flaming homes. My blood even now is spilled. I am unfathered, I am childless left; For how can sword the meanest peasant pierce, But me it pierces; any home be fired, But I am homeless and in ashes stand? Oh, now a thousand far-off wounds I feel, And thousands of strange tears are on my cheek! Of all afflicted I am most afflicted, Who bear a people's burden on my back; And I am bowed with all the Saxon woe. I take upon me, England, thy travail. I would be gone straightway; this wine is bitter And it hath got by now a look of blood! [Others who have been drinking set down their wine-cups. I'll tarry not! Who then steps South with me? [All rise, cheering. Each moment we delay some babe is slain, Each instant that we pause a home is fired! Doth any flinch? Then I see blood on him! And thou that urgest policy, if we Out of the North upon the Norman swoop, We swoop like eagles from a carcass red! Here are we blooded! Forward on the trail! Now sure upon the wind the Norman scent! We come on him aflush with victory! With axes from this carnage yet undried! And from the dead upon the living rush! Who bideth here? Thanes. None, none! Har. Who cometh South? Thanes. All! All! Har. Each man make ready for the South! [Thanes disperse with eager words. Gurth (putting his arm about Harold). Harold, I love thee; but thou art not wise. SCENE II The downs of Sussex at midnight. Harold's army marching South. On rising of the curtain is heard the sound of old battle-songs from troops already passed, dying away in distance. Down stage is a group of poor peasants, male and female. Their appearance is ragged and forlorn. They are saying farewell to various countrymen who are joining Harold's army, armed but with scythes and bill-hooks. The Standard-bearer now enters, with sound of bugles, bearing aloft the jewelled standard of âThe Fighting Man.â Then Harold enters, his battle-axe slung behind him, some of his most trusted Thanes following. As he advances the peasants run towards him, crying, âHarold! Harold!â and clasping his knees. An Old Man. O King, deliver us! Our home is burned, We are driven forth and starve on the hillside. And the rain soaks us, and the dews of night! I am too old to endure it, and my sons Are gone from me into thy battle, King! [He clasps him about the knees. A Woman. Harold, I cry for vengeance! They have taken My children from their mother; young girls both, To be the lustful sport of foreign lords. Give me my children back; in thee I trust! Another Aged Man. O King! Would I were young again! To strike The Norman robbers down; but I am bowed With years and I can give no aid but a cry. King, let me not go down unto the grave Till I have seen their blood upon our hills! To thee we look! [The group of peasants come round him with cries. Peasants. Vengeance, O vengeance! Har. (pausing). My people, as there is a God in heaven! I swear to you I will swift vengeance take! I'll drive these robbers into the hungering sea; No trumpet can so stir me as your cry! Your curses shall give edge unto this axe! Farewell a little: I'll return in blood! [They kiss his hands with cries of âHarold, our king!â âHarold, our hope!â and disperse. [Harold starts forward, when he is stayed by his mother Elfrida, who appears out of the darkness; two women and soldiers attending her are visible lower down. The Thanes about Harold, at a sign from him, go onward. Elfrida. Harold, thou most beloved of all my sons! Kiss me, thy mother, ere thou goest on! [Harold kisses her on the brow. Be not o'er-rash! Expose thee not o'er-much! Oh, much is due to England, yet to me, Who bore thee, something; in the battle-rage, When all the blood is up and blows come thick, Remember still women that wait behind, For Edith is come with me. [Harold starts. Thee the rush, The onset and the clamour will uphold, And most that thou art fighting for this land; But nothing shall uphold us but to hope, Expecting helplessly, with vain, vain hands. And, child, take heed of that left side, where thou Had'st injury when a boy, those years ago. What can I say or do now? Har. Nothing, mother. I would not seem unkind or soldier-rough, But thou must let me pass on to the battle. Thou hast the guard I sent thee? Elf. Yes, they wait us On the edge of yonder down; these few are here. Har. Hast thou enough? So few have I to spare Against the oncoming Norman. Elf. We are safe. What but will be our safety in thy peril! Har. Mother, farewell! Unman me not! And she? Elf. Edith will come to thee, if thou didst wish it, Else she will come not. Har. Call her then and quickly! [He again kisses Elfrida. She makes a sign to Edith, who is waiting in the background and now comes to Harold, Elfrida retiring. Edith. Harold, almost I feared to come to thee In such an hour, lest having hold of thee I could not let thee go. [They embrace passionately. Ah, I have kissed thee, I'll trouble not my soldier with a word. I have not brought thee tears, no, but a smile, And from this smile into the battle go. Remember in the war-press that I smiled. Har. If any fear I have, it is to lose thee. 'Tis not the Norman weighs upon my heart; And when the fight begins I'll see the end. But, ah, how difficult this moment is! [A trumpet calls. Hark, I am called! Edith. And still you see I smile. [Harold, with a last look on Edith again, presses on. She remains looking after him with a smile; then bursts into a storm of weeping till Elfrida, comforting her, leads her away. SCENE III A road over the downs leading to Senlac Hill. Midnight. Harold with certain chief Thanes marching. From the mouth of a woody cave on left Githa emerges, arresting Harold's progress. Githa. Harold of England! Whither goest thou? Har. (to his Thanes). Go all ye onward and await me. Here With the witch-woman I would speak alone. [Exeunt Thanes. Githa, thou wise witch-woman, see, I march To Senlac, there to fight the Norman. Thou Readest the boding night and thou art skilled In simples and the mingling of dim herbs, And by dark ways at knowledge hast arrived, Withheld from simple folk. Unfold to me, How shall I fare in this great clash of arms? [Githa remains silent. Speak, woman! Lest I have a doubt of thee. [She is silent. Thou answerest notâah, what takes hold of thee? Thy hair flies wild and foam is on thy lips; Taller thou seemst! What God or demon now Possesses thee? Githa (appearing to be shaken by some invisible power). Spare me, Alcandra dark! Relax thy fury! Lest this body bear No more thy dreadful visitation! Ah, The power hath come upon me: I am calm. (In solemn tone:) Harold! Har. Say on! Thou hast, it seems, for me Some superhuman news. Githa. She speaks; not I. Har. Who? Githa. She but uses these my mortal lips. But what I do but stammer hath been willed By stars in Council ere this earth began. Har. Deliver it. Githa. Harold, on Senlac Hill Thy host is overthrown, and reeleth back. [Harold starts; then listens, leaning on his battle-axe. Beware that arrow! To thy brain it flies; Thou goest without cry unto the ground. Har. Is it death, woman, is it death? Githa. A death decreed, Thy single life defers the Eternal will. Lo! It is fated that the Norman blood With Saxon shall be mingled happily, Toward the shaping of the mighty world. And from this wine of blood, to-morrow spilled, Shall spring a fortunate vintage from the Earth. A mighty brew from battle shall be made, For from that mingling shall an Empire rise Vaster than any by the sun beheld. Thy life alone this mighty marriage mars Of nations, and the destined fusion foils. For whilst thou livest England to thee were true. Thou standest now in the straight path of Fate, And but thy dying can make clear her way. For with the years, and the kind touch of Time, Norman and Saxon shall together come, Together stand up in the clash of arms, On many a foreign plain and alien hill, And in one host shall battle and o'erthrow. Then shall a navy sweep the strangest seas, And ultimate ocean; and the dreadful deep Shall be the mirror of her mighty masts. A greater England shall arise and queen The vast and wandering waters of the world. And she shall lay her arm about the East, And the huge Orient with a remnant hold, Tribes in full stare of PhÅbus and aspects Into a dimness kissed by splendid suns; Millions of turbaned brows and thrones of gold, And shores of spice and pearl and emerald. Not here alone shall England triumph, she A mighty river shall ascend by night, And with the dawn a new dominion grasp, Cradle of heroes, radiant, snowy-clear. Never shall sun upon that Empire set. Harold, behold thy necessary doom; World-destiny, no less, demands thy death; And so shall one man for the people die. [She falls as exhausted on the ground. Har. Though this thing be, I'll fight in fury still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV SCENE I (This is a spectacular scene and can be omitted.) The Norman camp. Night-time. Priests are passing along the kneeling, clean-shaven Norman lines, administering the Eucharist to the tinkling sound of the holy bell. There is a solemn silence. SCENE II The Saxon camp in violent contrast. Seated by their watch-fires the Saxon soldiers are drinking and trolling out old songs of war. At back Harold and Gurth enter silently, with cloaks hiding their armour. As they pause for a moment to inspect the scene, a group of Norman monks enter at the side, bearing a cross. Gurth. Brother, thou seest how the Norman monks Steal on our fellows singing at their ease! Mark how they'll cow these roaring roysterers. Already each man pauses, cup in hand, And the wild ballads die down on the night! Listen, but be not seen! [As the monks solemnly advance, the songs gradually cease, the men setting down their cups to listen. The Chief Monk (bearing a cross). Woe to all you that by the watch-fires sing The barbarous ballad! Woe and woe again To all the Saxon host! Ye are defiled; Whom do you fight for but an oath-breaker? [Harold starts forward, but is restrained by Gurth. Gurth. Brother, be still! observe the heavy spell That is already fallen on our host! See how they droop and cease to drink, and all Desist from the rough stave of war. Be still! The Monk. Ye men of England, feel ye not even now The curse upon you? Lo! To-morrow ye War not with men; ye war with God Himself! The God of battles that remembereth! Your hearts shall faint, your arms drop to your side, The battle-axe is cloven in your hands, Already are ye vanquished, not by man; The Lord of hosts the Norman battle guides. Leave then your king before the coming doom; On his head be the pains of perjury! You, ere it be too late, flee from the wrath! I warn ye by this cross! [He holds aloft the crucifix. Other Monks. Woe on ye! Woe! [The Monks slowly depart. A Soldier. My blood runs cold in me. Another. I'll drink no more. Another. I will not leave the King though I be cursed! Another song! [To this the only response is silence. Another. He fights best who drinks best, not he who prays! Another. The heart is out of me; I sit in fear. Gurth (to Harold at back). Now, brother, thou hast heard and thou hast seen! Har. I'll speak to them! Gurth. I pray you to keep silence. But, Harold, that these men now cold and cowed May summon back a courage for to-morrow, Stand then out of the battle! [Harold starts from him angrily. Ah, I know How difficult for thee! But so 'twere wise. How can this host be any more accursed If fighting but for their land and for thee? And I, who have not violated oath, I, who am not forsworn, may freely lead. I plead with thee for England, not thyself. [He makes a strong, pleading gesture to Harold. Har. Then should I loathe myself for evermore, And rightly then should all men point at me, Saying, âBehold the man that lurked behind, Sat idle in his tent while others bled. The King who from the field of battle slunk, And saw afar his subjects die for him. Behold the nidering whose name was Harold!â I think not that these dear, dear English hearts Who have stood with me in many a bloody brunt, Will quail at any monkish mummery, When comes the battle-glee upon the mind, And the great shout goes up: âFor Harold strike!â And where is he? A-tremble in his tent! No! On this hill I stand; I'll not go back! Gurth. Hither too rash already hast thou marched, And wilt thou be more rash? Har. Thou wastest words! I smell the dawn of battle in the air! SCENE III A road in the neighbourhood of Senlac. Sunset. Battle-cries of the rival armies are heard off. The Saxon is âOut! Out! Holy Cross!â and the Norman, âHa Rou!â A group of peasants are waiting to hear news when Saxon soldiers in flight run across. A Soldier (to peasants). The King is slain; fly, fly! Another. Flee for your lives; The Norman is upon youâour men fall! Another (wounded, limping). Stay not a moment, if ye still would live! I am sore hurt. [Two peasants advancing help him onward. Another. Harold the King is fallen. Three Others. Harold is fallen, Harold is fallen. A Peasant (to others). Away! [They all exeunt hurriedly after the flying soldiers. SCENE IV The tent of William of Normandy pitched on the field. Night after the battle. William and certain chosen knights are sitting at supper. Enter Elfrida, mother of Harold, followed by Edith, both hooded and stepping slowly. Some Saxon priests with torches accompany them. [Elfrida, advancing, kneels and touches the hand of the Duke. Wil. Woman, who art thou, that with leave ungiven Com'st in upon us? Answer who thou art; Urgent must be thy errand it would seem. Elf. Wist thou not by my touch I am his mother? Sir, I have come unto thee and I kneel To ask thee for my son Harold, the King. [William starts from her. Only his body now I beg of thee, That I may bury it with solemn rite, If not with ceremony, still with care. Five sons I had, and all to-night are dead. My wild Sweyn over seas; and Tostig next Fell with Hardrada on the northern moor; Now Harold, Gurth and Leofwin at once All slain; a little thing I ask of thee, Now all those boys I loved lie without breath, To take the dearest up into my arms, And carefully to lay him in the earth. Wil. Untombed let lie the accursÃ¨d of the Church, And on his flesh the raven glut her young! [Elfrida rises and slowly retires, weeping. Edith, advancing, stands before the conqueror with hood flung back. Edith. Norman, thou durst not so demean the brave, Who England loved, and Edith, and England first. Who tarried not by fierce Hardrada's course, Nor lingered while ye plundered his dear land, But from the North in anger came on you, And stood up with his battle-axe and clove The gathered chivalry of many realms. The arrow and no army overcame him! [A low murmur of admiration is heard from the Norman knights, which William hearing, speaks. Wil. Who then art thou that speakest without fear? Edith. O Duke, I am but she whom Harold loved, And who loved Harold; now I do but ask That I may have his body to bury it. Her sorrow is the greater; she is old And she did dandle him upon her arm, When that which is a body was a babe. But if thou wilt not to the mother yield, Yet yield to me that so did love the dead! [Further murmurs of praise. The Sire de Mallet (rising). Sire, thou wilt do what seemeth to thee best. But here, it seems to me, and all of us, Who have fought by thee through this heavy day, That, though the victors, we are gentlemen. [Assent from knights. And as no Norman yieldeth to a foe, So to a woman he might yield the more. Wil. (somewhat moved). Lady, that so didst love that man, depart And find thy dead out from among the dead And bury him with the due rite of priest. But much I fear thou shalt not know his face, So marred is he by battle and so changed. Edith. I should know Harold howsoever marred. [She bows before the Duke and retires outward with Elfrida, followed by priests bearing torches. SCENE V The moonlit battle-field of Senlac. Edith and Elfrida, hooded, are guided slowly over the hill among the slain, gazing first upon one, then upon another of the strewn dead. At last Edith throws herself on the body of Harold beneath the torn Saxon standard with a cry. Two priests advance and throw the light of torches on the dead man's face. Edith raises him in her arms, moaning softly. A Priest (bending down with torch). Lady, is it the King? I knew him not. Edith. BelovÃ¨d, all those scars deceive not me. [The moon, emerging, falls on Edith, who has raised Harold's head upon her lap. Curtain.</field>
