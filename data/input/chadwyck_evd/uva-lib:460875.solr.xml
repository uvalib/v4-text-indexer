      <field name="fulltext">ST. CLEMENT'S EVE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUC D'AUMALE, THIS COMMEMORATION OF A PRINCE OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF FRANCE, MORE FAVOURED BY NATURE THAN BY FORTUNE, IS DEDICATED WITH GREAT RESPECT BY THE AUTHOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE On the very day on which the Duke of Orleans died was born Dunois, Bastard of Orleans (the offspring of his amour with Madame De Chauny), who was cherished by his widow with a love not less than that which she bare to her own children, and to whose wisdom and prowess charles VII. owed the restoration of Normandy and Guyenne to the crown of France; whilst his legitimate son, Charles Duc d'Orleans, wounded and taken prisoner at the battle of Agincourt, applied himself to literature and poetry for his consolation during a mournful captivity of twenty-five years. âIl faisait des vers mieux que personne en France, et trouvait un douloureux plaisir Ã  cÃ©lÃ©brer, dans de touchantes ballades, le regret de passer sa vie loin de son pays de sa famille, de ses amours, et de rester oisif et inutile, sans pouvoir gagner la gloire des chevaliers. Il dÃ©plorait aussi les calamitÃ©s et rappelait l'ancienne renommÃ©e du noble royaume de France, lui reprochant ses dÃ©sordres qui avaient attirÃ© la colÃ¨re celeste. Il demandait Ã  Dieu de lui accorder, avant d'arriver Ã  la vieillesse, les plaisirs de la paix et du retour. D'autres fois il reprochait Ã  la Fortune d'exercer sur lui une si rude seigneurie, et de faire si fort la renchÃ©rie. ââDois-je toujours ainsi languir? HÃ©las! et n'est-ce pas assez? ce triste refrain revenait Ã  chaque couplet de la ballade, et elle finissait ainsi: âDe ballader j'ai beau loisir, Autres dÃ©duits me son cassÃ©s, Prisonnier suis, d'amour martyr; HÃ©las! et n'est-ce pas assez?ââ Barante, vol. vi. pp. 228, 229. The gifts and attainments which adorn the exile of a Prince of the House of Orleans in our own time, are not therefore without a precedent in times past. In this Play I have desired to give some such representation as dramatic writing can convey, of a period in the history of France under Charles VI. when society was reduced, by disorders in the realm and schism in the Church, to perhaps the worst condition of which the Middle Ages can afford an example. The only feature of the time which can be contemplated with pleasure is the exceeding love which the people bare to their afflicted King. For the alienation of his mind, though intermittent, relieved him in their eyes from responsibility for their sufferings; showing how deprivation of power in a Sovereign (casual it is true in this case, but significant perhaps of the like results in cases in which it is politically ordained), may tend to enhance, rather than abate, the love and reverence of the people. Popular indignation was directed upon others, whilst loyalty and pity held a free course; and thenyouthful errors of the King (which were not those of an evil disposition) were forgotten in his calamity. He deserved that they should be forgotten; for so often as reason returned he seemed to be as tenderly sensible of the sufferings of his subjects as they were of his; and what little precarious power he possessed from time to time, walkingalways on the edge of insanity, aws exerted for their relief. His brother Louis, Duke of Orleans, aws the representative of the chivalry of france for the time being: âRien si chevaleresque,â says the historian: âD'ailleurs ilÃ©toit aimable, agrÃ©able et doux dans ses maniÃ¨res; son langage Ã©toit facile, raisonable et sÃ©duisant; il savoit s'entretenir mieux qu'aucun Prince avec les Docteurs et les hommes habiles des conseils du Roi.â And in the appeal delivered to the Council by the AbbÃ© of St. Fiacre on the part of his widow, shortly after his death, it is averred to have been known to every one that in eloquence and discernment his equal was hardly to be found; âSapiebat,â he adds, âsiout Angelus Domini;â whilst in his life and manners he was frank, gentle, and compassionate; and in personal beauty, says the AbbÃ©, if that were a matter to be spoken of, there needed no more to be said than that he resembled the King. If the duke was chivalrous, not so was the age in which he lived. Nor indeed is chivalry (in the sense of nobility of mind) the attribute of any age or of Knights and nobles at large in any time or country, though there may be more individual examples of it in one age than in another. And those who, like Aristo (himself born in the fifteenth century), ascribe to a class, will generally be found, like him, to put it back to a few centuries before any times that they know much about. th efiftenth century at alll events was full of frauds and treacheries in every walk of life; and even a chivalrous man ion those days, if sagacious, might have been expected to be suspicious. But amongst the chivalrous qualities of Louis Duke of Orleans was a gebrous, perhaps careless, confidence in men who were not worthy to be trusted. The antagonist by whom he was first confronted at his Brother's court, his Uncle Phillipe le Hardi, Duke of Burgundy, was, it is true, as honourable as himself; and Louis probably made no mistake when, in a will dated in the season of their hostility, with a magnanimous faith in the other's magnaminity, he left his children to the guardianship of his enemy. But his Uncle died before him, and when the quarrel descended to Phillipe's son, âJean sans Peur,â Louis' confidence in the honour of an enemy was fatally misplaced. For whilst the Duke of Orleans represented the chivalry of the time such as it was (not a virtuous or stainless chivalry), the new Duke of Burgundy was an equally genuine representative of its cruelty and pride. if he was without fear, he was also without faith; and his short career was scarcely less perfidious than ferocious, from the tragedy in the Vielle Rue du Temple, till justice met him, in the form of what may be called specific retribution, on the bridge at Montereau. The fidelity of an historian is not to be expected of a dramatist. some transposition of events and compression of time have been necessary to bring certain slaient incidents of the period within the compass of the action; and without some variation of detail truth to art must have been sacrificed to historic truth in a larger measure than is demanded for the chief ends which historic truth is designed to subserve. even incidents which, being historically true, were at at the same time eminently dramatic or picturesque, have not always been available; inasmuch as they could not be harmonized with other dramatic effects. But under these conditions (which are I believe inevitable in all such works) my endeavour has been to represent failthfully the characters of the principal persons and the temper of the times. The contemporary or nearly contemporary authorities are the Chronicles of Jean Juvenal des Ursins, of the Religieux de St. Denys, and of Monstrelet; and a narrative almost equally minute, but less diffuse and more animated, may be read in the âHistoire des Ducs De Burgoghe de la Maison de Valois,â by M. De Barante; an author who, more than any other modern historian, seems to live in the times of which he writes. East Sheen, April, 1862.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âA Hall in the Palace of the Archbishop of Sens. The Provost of Paris and Robert the Hermit. Provost. His Grace has not yet risen; his health is weak; But from his chaplain we shall hear anon Whether it please him, when the Council meets, To call you in. I doubt not that he will. Robert. My call is from a greater than his Grace, Whom both obey. Provost. Meantime 'tis fit you know What face we wear at Paris. Robert. France elsewhere Bleeds from a thousand wounds. Each step I took In my long journey hither, brought in sight Old scars and new. What face the town puts on Thou shalt instruct me; for God gives me leave To learn from pious men. Provost. Slowly the King Picks up the fragments of his shatter'd mind, And as the daylight on his reason dawns Beholds his kingdom a bewilder'd wreck Tost to and fro by factions, rent and riven By these two rival Dukes; his brother first, And next his cousin, seizing sovran sway, And each so using it as makes good men Hope something from a change. When Orleans rules With dance and song a light and dissolute grace Doth something gild misgovernment; whilst they Who hear him, 'twixt a revel and a masque, Give audience to some Doctor of the Church, Grave as the Doctor's self and gracious more, Cannot but marvel that a man so sage, And for his years so learned, should misuse The gifts of God and be his country's curse. Then comes that other Duke, revengeful, rough, Imperious and cruel; and they who winced Beneath his cousin's handling, wonder now That they were not content. You'll see them both; For when the King's physicians gave him leave To sit in council, he bade both attend, Thinking to put their discords into tune; Wherein when Jove and Saturn meet and kiss There's hope he may prevail. Robert. On either head A vial will I empty. Provost. Wellâsoâwellâ But if I err not, the Archbishop's Grace Would gladly know the purport and the drift Of that you shall discourse. Robert. It may not be. Say to his Grace I know it not myself. Whate'er God puts it in my heart to say That will I speak; but counsel will I none With mortal man. Provost. The courage of the tongue Is truly, like the courage of the hand, Discreetly used, a prizeable possession; But what befits the presence of a King Is boldness temper'd with some touch of fear. Robert. There where I stand in presence of my King, There stand I, too, in presence of my God. Fearing my God I come before my King With reverence, as is meet, but not with fear. Provost. Well, for the King, poor gentleman, no speech How bold soe'er and telling bitter truth Would meet a frown from him. His brother shares The sweetness of his nature. Other clay, Dug from some miry slough or sulphurous bog, With many a vein of mineral poison mix'd, Went to the making of Duke Jean-Sans-Peur. This knew the crafty Amorabaquin. When captives by the hundred were hewn down 'Twas not rich ransom only spared the Duke. 'Twas that a dying Dervish prophesied More Christian blood should by his mean be shed Than e'er by Bajazet with all his hosts. Therefore it was to France he sent him back With gifts,âand what were they? 'twas bowstrings made Of human entrails. Robert. Choice the offering! Yea, Fit bounty of fit patron to fit friend. Provost. Good Robert, neither thine nor yet that voice, Were it again on earth, which sober'd Saul, Can mitigate Duke John, or heal the strife Which from these quarrelsome cousins breathes abroad War, pestilence and famine. Hope it not. Once by his Grace of Bourbon's intercession Peace was patch'd up and injuries forgiven. Well, some three months was wonderful accord; Then came black looks, and then âTo arms, to arms!â The sole sick hope of France is in the King. Awhile his malady remits, and joy Lights up the land; then darkness re-descends. Give but to him stability of health And all were well. Alas! it will not be. Robert. Whence came the chastisement the mercy may. Provost. Whence came the chastisement we know; but how And wherefore, was a mystery for long years And diversely discoursed. Urban of Rome Did nothing doubt 'twas that the King had own'd Clement of Avignon; whilst Clement knew 'Twas that he fought not to the death 'gainst Urban; His doctors said 'twas that he ceased their drugs; All doctors else, that he had sometime ta'en them; The people deem'd it in its first assault A judgment for the imposts and the aids, But seeing these have doubled since, they fell From this belief, and as he was a boy When first afflicted, were it this, they said, His Council should go mad and not himself. Thus error is but transient, truth prevails Sure as day follows night, and now none doubts, What to wise men was patent from the first, That 'tis the work of sorcerers, men accursed And slaves of Satan, and by him suborn'd Upon this Christian Kingdom to bring down Disaster and dismay, and snare the souls Of thousands daily shedding brothers' blood. But who they be, these sorcerers, there's the doubt; Not few have been impeach'd and hang'd or burnt; But no success ensuing, the charge, 'tis deem'd, Was fashion'd in excess of godly zeal Which Satan misdirected; thus the quest Is daily keener lest the King relapse; And there be now arrived two monks from Eu Who know to search out sorceries. Much hope Is squander'd on these monks, but for myself I like them not; they ride in coats of mail And waste the night in riot and debauch. Still if they know their art, far be it from me To question of their lives. Robert. If these be evil Their art is not of God, nor aught avails For counterworking Satan. Let them troop. I will not suffer them. Provost. Nay, but we must. 'Tis partly herein to advise the King The Council meets to-day. Enter the Archbishop's Chaplain. Well, worthy friend, What saith his Grace? Chaplain. Good Hermit, come this way. His Grace hath wrapp'd him hastily in his gown And said his hours and waits you in his closet. He's favourably minded, and he says He knows not if your mission be divine, But were it human only, he were loth To let good words be lost. Please you, this way. Scene II. âA Street.âA Religious Procession crosses the Stage, chanting a âGratias agimusâ and carrying a Shrine with the true and entire head of St. Denys, accompanied by a throng of citizens. 1st Citizen. Well, for this mercy of mercies God be praised! And if his gracious Highness would but please To walk abroad, should not his eyes behold The loving'st truly and the joyfullest city That earth can show. 2nd Citizen. I never saw the like; 'Tis as a town for many a month besieged When now the siege is raised and food and wine Come in by cart-loads. Seem'd we not before Half starved, and now half tipsy? 3rd Citizen. Starved we were And starved we are; but foul befall the wretch, If such there be, who would not feed for life On husks and draff if so it might please God To keep the King in health. Woman. Bless him for ever When he was well, not one so mean among us But he could spare a smile to make her happy. Bless his sweet gracious kingly face! I saw him Kneeling at mass so comely and so holy! But Lord, Sirs, he was ghostly pale. Priest. Poor soul! What hath he suffer'd! Never king but David Was so tormented; yea, the sorrows of Hell Gat hold of him. 2nd Citizen. Alas, and may again! 3rd Citizen. Mercy forbid! Priest. St. Clement's Eve draws near; 'Twixt this and then, watch ye and pray. Ye know The ancient verse writ with a raven's quill Which threatens at that hour the House of Valois. 'Tis thus it runs: âWhen fourteen hundred years and seven âHave slid since Jesus came from Heaven, âFates and Furies join to weave âA garland for St. Clement's Eve. âHouse of Valois, hold thine own! âA shadow sits upon a throne. âWare what is and is to be, âThere's blood upon the Fleur-de-Lys.â Wherefore if aspects evil and malign Ye from that House would turn, 'twixt this and then Watch ye and fast and pray. 3rd Citizen. Yes, father, yes; And ever 'tis my prayer that God would please To point a finger at those sorcerers That work the King this ill. Give us to know What men they be, we'd slice them into gobbets And fling their flesh to the dogs. 2nd Citizen. Look, who comes here; Surely the wise and worthy monks from Eu Who come to search it out, and with them one That's sore suspected, Passac, the King's barber. Enter from the side at which the procession had passed out Father Buvulan and Father Betizac, followed by two Marshalsmen with Passac in custody and a throng of Citizens shouting. Passac. Oh hear me! Sirs, alas, ye will not hear me! Citizens. Where is the cart? the cart has fallen behind: Stop for the cart; no faggots here, no pitch! Passac. Oh hear me, Sirs: I ever loved the King, Yea, was his very worshipper; I hurt him! I that would die to give his gracious soul One moment's peace. Father Buvulan. My friends, ye are not fools, Ye are not senseless blocks; ye have your wits; Ye can discern the truth. Behold this barber; Look at this bag and ring. What shall be said? Here's one that, being barber to the King, Puts me this ring into a corpse's mouth, (A Jew's that had been hung was Tuesday week For strangling Chrisom babies ere the Priest Sweating with haste could reach to christen them), Sticks me this ring into this corpse's mouth, Leaves it three days, then puts it in this bag Sewn with the dead man's skin and fill'd to the neck With his accursed ashes, and the bag Wears next his heart. What shall be said, I ask? Citizens. Away to the stakeâhale him alongâaway! And prod him with your lances as ye go. Passac. Oh, Sirs, 'tis false; I never did such things. Kind, noble Sirs, believe me, for the ring I had it of my wife when I was courting; The bag, Sirs, holds the ashes of St. Maud; 'Twas given me by the Abbot of Beaumanoir By reason I had shaven him fifteen years, When, times being hard, he could not pay in cash And gave me this. Father Betizac. Truly the Father of Lies Sits like a weaver at his loom and weaves. You'll find him, Sirs, as hardy to deny The Eve of Pentecost, when he was seen At midnight in the Rue des Ursulines Ranging and whirling round and round the gibbet, Whiles the dead bodies, swinging in the wind, Sang âAve Sathanas!â That too he'll deny. Passac. As I'm a Christian man, Sirs, it is false. Father Betizac. I told you so; I knew he would deny it. Passac. At midnight on the Eve of Pentecost I was at nocturns in the Chapel Royal. 2nd Citizen. Oh monstrous liar! I saw thee with mine eyes Ranging and scouring round and about the gibbet At midnight chimes; yea, with mine eyes I saw thee; Thou hadst put on the body of a cur, A cock-tail'd cur. Father Betizac. And did ye mark, my friends, Now as we pass'd the true head of St. Denys, And playing on our easy credulous minds He knelt and cross'd himself,âmark'd ye, I say, How the head frown'd? 3rd Citizen. It did; I saw it frown; An angry frown; I trembled like a leaf. Passac. 'Twas at these monks it frown'd and not at me. 'Tis they that are magicians, as I can prove; 'Tis they. Father Buvulan. Oh mercy on my sinful soul! I ne'er knew Satan so enraged before. Here comes the cart; bring him along, false hound! Mark when he burns if the flames be not blue. Citizens. Bring him alongâa faggot eachâcome on. Passac. Dolts! Idiots! Will ye have my life? Then take it; And may the curse of God and all good men And all the blessed Company of Heaven Swallow you quick, ye blood-bespatter'd knaves, And send you seething to the bottomless pit? Father Betizac. Hoo! grace defend us! What! blue flames already! Look to him, serjeants, he is dangerous; Soâknot his hands behind him. Up with a psalm: Sing as ye go the âDeus ultionum.â [Exeuntâthe Monks last. Then enter the Bastard of Montargis and Raiz de Vezelay. Montargis. Ay, a good wench I grant you, free and merry Before the wind; but luff her up and lo! Crack goes the topmast, rudder fells the pilot, Split flies the foresail.... Ha! is yonder monk .... Yes, by St. George it is.... Ho, Betizac! I think he hears me.... Yes, a lively wench, And, as they all are, winningâtill she's won; Then comes a change. De Vezelay. What! is it even so! Has Flos then fallen from her high estate To pass for flat? Montargis. Save when she's furious. Ha! Re-enter Father Betizac. The man I soughtâa serviceable man; Wilt do me a good turn? Father Betizac. Your worship's slave, Obedient ever. In my way, my Lord? Aught in my way? Montargis. In one, friend, of thy ways; For thou hast two; with roses strewn is this; That in like manner redâbut not with roses. 'Tis in the first I need thee; thou hast spells, Potions and powders, shells and herbs and seeds Gather'd or mixed when Dian in eclipse Made Venus doubly bright. Father Betizac. My Lord, I have; How come by 'twere not good for me to say Nor you to hear. But thus much I may tell; When Ashtaroth and Asmodai were flung From heaven to earth, they harbour'd in a cave In Normandy, when spitting on the ground, There where they spat upgrew a wondrous plant, Whereof the leaves, powder'd and mixed in wine, Are of that virtue they shall change the hearts Of twice-vow'd Vestals. Montargis. Such a one is she Whom I would subjugate; the Northern Lights Shine with no softer radiance, nor frequent A frostier region. Lo! a mineral spell, Less named than known in necromantic lore, I give thee in acquittance. [Gives him a gold piece. Send that drug. Betizac. 'Tis yours, my Lord. Montargis. Ere night? Betizac. My Lord, ere night I'll send it you. Montargis. A Cupid of mine own I'll send to fetch it, rather. Fare thee well. [Exit Betizac. De Vezelay. How's this, Montargis? Flos then fell not flat Till rose another o'er her? Montargis. Well, 'tis true. De Vezelay. Why, here's a change! like Carnival to Lent, Done in a day. Montargis. Truly a Lenten change Fits not my festive spirit; nor do I look For forty days to fast, or four or one. If not befriended by the friar's philter, I know by what; for I am of the mind Of Jean de Malestroit, that scrupulous Count Who beat his chaplain till the good man bent To grant him dispensation. De Vezelay. Ay, but Flos; Is she to dance along the slippery path She thinks shall bring her to the house of joy And find herself confronted by contempt Even at the gates? for was it not this night You were to fly together? Montargis. 'Twas to-night. There is a midnight service in the chapel. Flos and her fast friend Iolande St. Remy Attend it. So do I. The Rue St. Mark Is twenty paces distant. There should wait Two saddles empty and some five well fill'd. Pity it were such goodly preparation Should run to waste. Now Iolande St. Remy Sits on the throne of this unvalued Flos And so shall fill her saddle. De Vezelay. By consent? Montargis. The horse consents and that's enough. Ere dawn We shall have reach'd Montlhery. On the road Her strength shall fail and she shall lack support; Then comes the cunning Friar's well-mixed wine And all is as it should be. De Vezelay. For myself, I hold it less than loyal by a spell To work upon a woman. Montargis. Tut! Reprisals. She cannot by what conjuring you will Be more bewizarded than I'm bewitched. But hark you! we must take some thought for Flos; No midnight freaks for her. My Lady Abbess Must learn that she is mischievously minded And lock her up. Raiz, look to this for me And I will hold thee my true friend for life. I needs must to the council; for at three They meet to wrangle of the King's disease, And cloudy John expects me. De Vezelay. Be content; Flos shall be cared forâyou shall know to-night With what success. Montargis. Be diligent. Adieu. [Exit. De Vezelay. Here is a zigzag! I am wicked too In some sort, and with women; but thus to woo And thus to win and thus to strike and stab, Exceeds my tether. Poor forsaken Flos! Not all her brightness, sportfulness, and bloom, Her sweetness and her wildness and her wit, Could save her from desertion. No, their loves Were off the poise. Her boundless flood of love Swept out his petty rill. Love competent Makes better bargains than love affluent; He needs had loved her had she less loved him, And had I less loved herâshe mightâin timeâ But no, she never could have stoop'd to me. I'll do his errandânot for his sake, but hers. No better can befall her than this night To ponder in retreat. Some doubtful tale I'll tell to waken up my Lady Abbess, Which, its end answer'd, shall belie itself And leave the damsel stainless. For her friend, Poor Iolande, if I can save her, so; Not through the Abbessâhe would smell me thereâ Some other wayâand now that I bethink me, I know the stroke shall strike his lance askew. My Lord of Orleans is no friend to him And loves a chance adventure. He shall hear, And if Sir Bastard come not by a check I'll yield some credit to his conjurors. He's cruel over much. I've heard it said, When Blanche de Honcourt lost her hold, ere long A body in a sack was seen afloat Betwixt the bridges. Such things should not be. Scene III. âThe Council Chamber in the King's Palace.â The King, the Dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, the Archbishop of Sens, and other Councillors. Officers of State in attendance, amongst whom are the Bastard of Montargis and the Provost of Paris. The King. My Brother, Cousin John, and my good Lords, Much have I long'd once more to meet you here, And much it sometimes seem'd I had to say; But, Sirs, my voice is weak, more weak my wits, Being, as I am, new risen from the grave,â The grave, I say, wherein my mind was buried,â And you shall pardon me if tongue or thought Should falter, one or both. We meet to-day To reason of my illness; whence it comes And how to hold it off. But, Sirs, much more I would that ye should reason of the realm, Discern what ails it and divine what balm Shall heal its ghastly wounds. Oh, my good Lords, It breaks my very heart of heart in pieces, So often as I wake from these bad dreams, To find what's real worse. Apply your hearts, I pray you, to restore my Kingdom's health, And then take thought for mine. Archbishop. So please your Grace, Under God's providence, the Kingdom's health Attends upon the King's, whose health and weal Are as the fountain-head whence all the land Is water'd; 'tis in you your Kingdom finds All aid and increase, even as the Psalmist saith, âAll my fresh springs in thee.â Burgundy. And therefore first Behoves us reason of the first, and ask Who and what are they that with devilish art Poison the wells and fountain-head of France; And there be now arrived from Normandy Two wise and worthy monks, vouch'd by Sanxerre, Your Highness's true liege and faithful friend, For men of marvellous aptness to rip up The works of witchcraft. He avers, my Lords, The Province hath been purged the last ten years Of wizards to the number of threescore And twice so many witches, which is due Most chiefly to their skill and diligence. I hold it were no wisdom to forego Such aid as theirs. Orleans. One word, my Lords, to that. What know we of these monks or of their art? Save only that Sanxerre (whom God forbid That I should blame, for he is wise and true) Gives credence to their skill. But wisdom errs In nought more oft than putting easy trust In tales when things are dark. For man is loth, In argument where grounded thought is none And yet the theme solicitous, to fold The wings of thought and drop its lids and own That in a night of knowledge to roost and sleep Is judgment's sole sagacity. Thus he That justly should have balanced 'twixt two weights Substantial both though diverse in degree Of credibility, shall lose himself, Intent on vacancy, in snatching shadows And pondering of imponderable motes. I say, Sirs, we know nothing of these monks Nor of their art. Burgundy. Good cousin, by St. George Rumour hath wrong'd thee much if of some arts Thou know'st not more than most. What's that I see Circling thy left forefinger? Jean de Bar, Were he alive, could tell us of a work Wrought on a golden ring which bore enchased The royal arms of France. Orleans. And though he's dead, Mayhap, fair cousin, you shall see him somewhere; And that ere long, seeing the merry pace You travel on that broad and trodden way That leads to his abode. Sirs, Jean de Bar, Who, as ye know, made traffic of my youth And coin'd my ignorance, a just death died. I wish his peers no other. By his aid (Not gifted with that affable accost And personal grace which bids my cousin trust In his own prowessâconquering and to conquer) I hoped to triumph in affairs of love. He promised too to call me up the Devil, Whom (not content with some I daily met Of aspect diabolic) I craved to see. These follies of my green unguided youth Were render'd to the flames with Jean de Bar. Still of the art itself I spare to speak, Dilating but, in quality of witness, The art's practitioners as I have known them: For whatsoe'er they feign'd, I plainly saw The Devil had power on them, not they on him. But whether a veritable power there be By cryptic art and more than natural mean To exorcise, or if not exorcise, Divine whence comes possession, not to me Pertaineth to pronounce, but more to him Who sits amongst us spiritually raised To speak of spirits with authentic voice. What saith my Lord Archbishop? Archbishop. Sirs, 'tis true, As by his Grace of Orleans is averr'd Most wisely, that that function of the Church Which deals with evil spirits is usurp'd, And specially since of late the sword of schism Hath pierced her very vitals (God forgive The unspeakably abominable thieves That thus have rent Christ's garment for a spoil)â Since then, I say, this function is usurp'd By some of ill repute; such we disown; But to deny that incantation used In sacred sort, with ardours apostolic, Can cast out Devils, ay and the Prince of Devils, Were to gainsay what Holy Scripture proves Not less than daily fact. Sirs, for these monks, They should be holy men, but that they are I may not certify; for from their Abbot's Nor other hand ecclesiastical Have they credentials. Orleans. They have none from Nature; Ne'er did I see in church or camp or courtâ I will not say men like them (for in my time I have seen visages as villainous As any Normandy can send to scare us)â But men of visage more detestable I ne'er saw yetâmore cruel-eyed, or men Whose outside of their inside told a tale More foul and loathsome. On the brow of each, Writ by kind Providence that watcheth o'er us, I read the word âBeware!â Burgundy. Twere well, fair cousin, Read where you may that word in books or men, 'Twere read to better purpose. Archbishop. My Lords, these monks I cannot to your confidence commend. But there is one without attends your pleasure, A man of life religious and severe, Both gently born and well and widely known, Who, might it please your Highness, hath been charged, So he avers, divinely in a vision With what he deems a message from on high To be deliver'd in your royal presence Nor otherwise divulged. With your kind leave The Provost shall conduct him in. The King. At once. To pious men our ears are open ever. We'll hear this message. What may be his name? [Exit the Provost. Archbishop. 'Tis Menuot, but in the popular mouth, Robert the Hermit. He is strangely clad For such a presence, but his vows forbid A garb more seemly. Orleans. Let his vow be kept. What is it that he wears? A wildcat's skin To signify he dreams by day? Re-enter the Provost with Robert the Hermit. God's love! Was wildcat e'er so wild? The King. Good Sir, his Grace, My Lord Archbishop, tells us thou art charged Some message to make known. Rise then and speak. Robert. King and my gracious Sovereign, unto whom I bend the knee as one ordain'd of God, A message hath been given me, and I am bid To tell thee in what sort. St. Jerome's Day, My vows perform'd, I sail'd from Palestine, With favouring winds at first; but the tenth night A storm arose and darkness was around And fear and trembling and the face of death. Six hours I knelt in prayer, and with the seventh A light was flash'd upon the raging sea, And in the raging sea a space appear'd Flat as a lake, where lay outstretch'd and white A woman's body; thereupon were perch'd Two birds, a falcon and a kite, whose heads Bare each a crown, and each had bloody beaks, And blood was on the claws of each, which clasp'd This the right breast and that the left, and each Fought with the other, nor for that they ceased To tear the body. Then there came a cry Piercing the stormââWoe, woe for France, woe, woe! Thy mother France, how excellently fair And in how foul a clutch!â Then silence; then, âRobert of Menuot, thou shalt surely live, For God hath work to give thee; be of good cheer; Nail thou two planks in figure of a cross, And lash thee to that cross and leap, and lo! Thou shalt be cast upon the coast of France; Then take thy way to Paris; on the road, See, hear, and when thou com'st to Paris, speak.â âTo whom?â quoth I. Was answer made, âThe King.â I question'd, âWhat?â âThat thou shalt see, declare, And what God puts it in thy heart to speak That at the peril of thy soul deliver.â Then leap'd I in the sea lash'd to a cross, And drifting half a day I came to shore At Sigean on the coast of Languedoc, And parting thence barefooted journey'd hither For forty days save one, and on the road I saw and heard, and I am here to speak. The King. Good hermit, by God's mercy we are spared To hear thee, and not only with our ears But with our mind. Burgundy. If there be no offence, But take thou heed to that. Robert. What God commands, How smacks it of offence? But dire offence There were if fear of Man should choke God's word. I heard and saw, and I am here to speak. Nigh forty days I sped from town to town, Hamlet to hamlet, and from grange to grange, And wheresoe'er I set my foot, behold! The foot of war had been before, and there Did nothing grow, and in the fruitless fields Whence ruffian hands had snatch'd the beasts of draft Women and children to the plough were yoked; The very sheep had learnt the ways of war And soon as from the citadel rang out The larum-peal, flock'd to the city gates; And tilth was none by day, for none durst forth, But wronging the night season which God gave To minister sweet forgetfulness and rest, Was labour and a spur. I journey'd on, And near a burning village in a wood Were huddled 'neath a drift of bloodstain'd snow The houseless villagers: I journey'd on, And as I pass'd a convent, at the gate Were famish'd peasants, hustling each the other, Half fed by famish'd nuns: I journey'd on, And 'twixt a hamlet and a church the road Was black with biers, for famine-fever raged: I journey'd onâa trumpet's brazen clang Died in the distance; at my side I heard A child's weak wail that on its mother's breast Droop'd its thin face and died; then peal'd to Heaven The mother's funeral cry, âMy child is dead For lack of food; he hunger'd unto death; A soldier ate his food and what was left He trampled in the mire; my child is dead! Hear me, O God! a soldier kill'd my child! See to that soldier's quittanceâblood for blood! Visit him, God, with Thy divine revenge!â The woman ceased; but voices in the air, Yea and in me a thousand voices cried, âVisit him, God, with Thy divine revenge!â Then they too ceased, and sterner still the Voice Slow and sepulchral that took up the wordâ âHim, God, but not him only nor him most; Look Thou to them that breed the men of blood, That breed and feed the murderers of the realm. Look thou to them that, hither and thither tost Betwixt their quarrels and their pleasures, laugh At torments that they taste not; bid them learn That there be torments terribler than these Whereof it is Thy will that they shall taste, So they repent not, in the belly of Hell.â So spake the Voice, then thunder shook the wood, And lightning smote and splinter'd two tall trees That tower'd above the rest, the one a pine, An ash the other. Then I knew the doom Of those accursed men who sport with war And tear the body of their mother, France. Trembling though guiltless did I hear that doom, Trembling though guiltless I; for them I quaked Of whom it spoke; Oh, Princes, tremble ye, For ye are they! Oh, hearken to that Voice! Oh cruel, cruel, cruel Princes, hear! For ye are they that tear your mother's flesh; Oh, flee the wrath to come! Repent and live! Else know your doom, which God declares through me, Perdition and the pit hereafter; here Short life and shameful death. [Exit. Burgundy. Ho, ho! My Lords, What say ye to my Lord Archbishop's friend? A prophet or a railer? Nay, Sirs, speak; Or have dumb Devils enter'd you? Orleans. My Lords, I with his Grace of Burgundy my cousin Stand equally denounced; yet deem I not That holy man a railer. To my ears He spake disastrous truth, and from my soul, Sore wearied with the burthen of its sins, I grieve for what is past, and pray that God, Whose goodness and whose multitude of mercies I rankly have abused, will give me strength By works of penitence to rescue France, War-wasted France my mother, and as a brand Pluck'd from the burning, her unworthiest son. And cousin of Burgundy, for all words and deeds Of this and other days that did thee wrong I humbly crave forgiveness, first of God And next of thee; and in the Celestines In token of contrition will I found Two daily masses for thy father's soul. Burgundy. Gramercy, my good cousin, by St. George I bear no malice, I, nor ever did. Here is my hand; I swear from this time forth I'll love thee as myself, yea heartily; And to thine enemies I hold my sword As counter as to mine. And now, my Lords, To business. For these Augustinian Monks, Are they at hand? Montargis. My Lord, they were not summon'd. Burgundy. Not summon'd? Provost. But they are not far to seek; For in the Rue des Ursulines but now I met them, with a rabble that rear'd a stake, And in their hands one Passac at his prayers Waiting to be confess'd. Orleans. What! Passac? No! My good friend Passac! He to burn! God's death! Attendance there! I'll see to that myself. [Exit. Burgundy. Send for these Monks. The King. Good cousin, no, not now. My head is weak; I may not tax it more. My Lords, pray pardon me; another day I'll ask your further aid. The Monks can then Be brought before you. This day's conference May well content us, since it heals the strife Betwixt our two chief councillors and friends; And more to their accord I bid you look Than the frail hope of strength renew'd in me To give the kingdom peace. Sirs, fare ye well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âThe Banqueting Room in the Palace of the Duke of Orleans. Tables spread. A company are assembled, amongst whom are Henri de Vierzon, RenÃ© D'Aicelin, Enguerrand de Chevreuse, LorÃ© de Cassinel, Alain Thibaut, Eustace D'Estivet (the Duke's Minstrel), and Griz-Nez (the Duke's Fool). To whom enters the Duke's Seneschal. Seneschal. His Highness bids you to sit down and sup; He will be with you later. De Vierzon. As he will. What round white arms withhold him? Seneschal. Out, De Vierzon; No damsel is it, but a devotee. De Vierzon. That pretty Theologue De Ricarville Is both in one. I drink her health and his. Stay them with flagons, comfort them with apples! Seneschal. Robert the Hermit 'tis, I tell thee. De Vierzon. So! Then Cupid's case is desperate for a day. What think ye of this pact betwixt the Dukes? Shall it endure? D'Aicelin. Till death. But how soon death, Under the countenance of dear Cousin John, May enter to dissolve it, who can tell? To-day they rode together on one horse, Each in the other's livery. To-morrow They are to sleep together in one bed. The People stare and deem the day is nigh When lamb and lion shall lie down together. De Chevreuse. Rode on one horse! D'Aicelin. Yea, Orleans before, And Burgundy behind. Gris-Nez. 'Twas so they rode: Two witches on one broomstick rode beside them; But riding past an image of Our Lady The hindmost snorted and the broomstick brake. De Cassinel. Would I were sure my gout would be as brief As their good fellowship. De Vierzon. To see grim John Do his endeavour at a gracious smile Was worth a ducat; with his trenchant teeth Clinch'd like a rat-trap. De Cassinel. Ever and anon They open'd to let forth a troop of words Scented and gilt, a company of masques Stiff with brocade, and each a pot in hand Fill'd with wasp's honey. D'Aicelin. Nay, no more of him; The wine turns sour. Come, Eustace, wake thee up! Hast ne'er a song to sing us? Rose and Blanche And Florence d'Ivry with her deep-mouth'd eyes And Merry Marriette,âwhere are they gone, The score of maids that made thee musical In days of old? or if their date be out, Have none succeeded? D'Estivet. Ah! my youth! my youth! Gone like a dream, and now at twenty-eight I live on recollections. No, my songs Have had their day; the charms I sang are fled; The ears I charm'd are deafen'd in the dust. What would ye with my ditties? But there's one His Highness made, which, if I mar it not, Should find its way. D'Aicelen. Be still, De Vierzon; hush! Eustace d'Estivet sings to a lute. At peep of day, at peep of day, Day peep'd to spy what night had done, And there she lay, and there she lay, Blushing in the morning grey And hiding from the Sun Arise, arise, Aurora cries, My dainty sister sweet, and throws With frolic grace and looks that speak Of love and gladness, at her cheek A dew-besprinkled rose. D'Aicelin. Minstrel, well sung, and well conceited, Duke; What is this whispering, LorÃ©? De Cassinel. Shall I tell? De Vierzon's by an envious Abbess charged That through the convent-grate he kiss'd a Nun; Whereon the Court Ecclesiastical Puts forth a process; this that he may answer To-morrow noon, he fain would have me swear I saw him in St. Michael's on his knees That very hour the Abbess of St. Loo Swears to the kiss. D' Aicelin. And didst thou kiss the Nun? De Vierzon. I may have kiss'd a linnet in a cage, But as to Nuns, oh no. D' Aicelen. Come, I'll bestead thee; As for myself, I have an errand then At ChÃ¢teau-Menil; but I'll send my page With orders to swear what you will. De Vierzon. Much thanks; He shall not be the loser. Gris-Nez. Ah, sweet Sir, Had you been pleased to come to me for council Before you kiss'd that Nun! De Vierzon. What then, Sir Fool? Gris-Nez. Knowest thou not, Sir Fool, my brother, One dirty hand can wash another; Ofttimes offences that are twins Shall suffer less than single sins; Stern forfeits tread upon his kibe Who hath not robb'd enough to bribe; To distance justice in the course Who steals a purse should steal a horse; Not hardly the offender fares When Accusation hath gone shares: Receive thou then, dear brother Fool, Monition wise from Folly's School, To kiss a Nun nor fear the worst Thou should'st have kiss'd the Abbess first. De Cassinel. By Peter's keys! to moralize a kiss No preaching have I heard more pertinent. Here comes the Dukeâno, 'tis but little Geoffrey. Enter Geoffrey de Laval. Geoffrey. His Grace desires you'll none of you depart Till he shall join you. De Vierzon. With such wine as this To wet our wings, no thoughts have we of flight. Is the lean Hermit with his Highness still? Geoffrey. No, he is gone; 'tis Vezelay that's with him. De Vierzon. Thou dost not say so! Well, the times are strange; To the backbone Burgundian is he And private with the Duke! What next? De Chevreuse. Why nextâ Enter the Duke of Orleans. They rise to receive him. Orleans. Kind Sirs, I pray you pardon this neglect; Scant courtesy it was not, but strict need. I drink your healths. No, Seneschal, gramercy: I'll neither eat nor sit. My trusty friends, I have a work in hand will ask your aid. The Bastard of Montargis, as I hear, Designs this night to seize and spirit away A pupil of the Celestines; which rape I would not such a rotten-hearted rogue As he is, should accomplish; wherefore, Sirs, Of five of you I crave attendance here An hour ere midnight arm'd. De Vierzon. Your Grace has named A service I shall clasp and strain to heart Even as my best friend's wife. De Chevreuse. And so shall I. De Cassinel. And all. Orleans. I thank you heartily; but no; Montargis is attended but by five, Whom we must not outnumber. Hie ye home, De Vierzon and De Cassinel, and you, RenÃ© d' Aicelin, Enguerrand De Chevreuse, And Alain Thibaut; hie ye home and arm, And hither hasten back at your best speed. The rest, good-night. And be ye sure, my friends, For right good service your good wills shall count. [Exeunt all but the Duke and Geoffrey de Laval. Geoffrey. A boon, my gracious Lord. Orleans. What is it, boy? Geoffrey. Let me be one. Orleans. No, no; too young, too young. They'd blow thy head off like the froth of their ale And I should lose a monkey that I love. Geoffrey. My gracious Master, at your side to die Is all I live for. Orleans. Be content, young friend. The time may come. Thy horoscope and mine Point to one hour, 'tis said. Enough of this. Go to the vestiary, wherein thou'lt find Provision of all garbs for the masqued ball. Thence to the hall bring thou six pilgrims' weeds. Scene II. âThe Interior of the Convent of the Celestines. Iolande de St. RÃ©my and Flos de Flavy. Flos. A charming little Abbess if you will; That liberty she grants herself, good soul, She not denies to others; so far, well; But then comes Father Renault, spare and dry, With menace of the Bishop and the Chapter, And in her straits we're straiten'd. Oh, no, no, I cannot bear it; some day I shall run; Yes, Iolande, I will, I will. Iolande. Oh Flos! Oh foolish Flos! impatient of restraint Because you scarce have felt it. The loose rein It is that makes the runaway; too kind The Abbess is; for those who say she errs In other ways and worse, God pardon them! Or if their tale be true, God pardon her! But God forbid that I should know it true, For love her I needs must. Flos. What! though she's wicked? Iolande. Yes, though she's wicked. That is not forbidden. In pain and sorrow should I love her then, As I love you. Flos. Oh, I am wicked too? Iolande. No, there I said too much. But yet with fear, If not with pain, you fill me. Flos, from my soul I hate the man you love. Flos. Well, you speak out; But ere you spake I knew it. Iolande. Did you but know The cause !âand I will tell you it in part. Last night I had a dreadful dream. I thought That borne at sunrise on a fleece of cloud I floated high in air, and, looking down, Beheld an ocean-bay girt by green hills, And in a million wavelets tipp'd with gold Leapt the soft pulses of the sunlit sea; And lightly from the shore a bounding bark, Festive with streamers fluttering in the wind, Sail'd seaward, and the palpitating waves Fondly like spaniels flung themselves upon her, Recoiling and returning in their joy; And on her deck sea-spirits I descried Gliding and lapsing in an undulant dance, From whom a choral gratulating strain Exhaled its witcheries on the wanton air: Still sail'd she seaward, and ere long the bay Was left behind; but then a shadow fell Upon the outer seaâa shadowy shapeâ The shadow bore the likeness of the form Of the Arch-fiend; I shudder'd for the bark And stretch'd my hands to heaven and strove to pray But could not for much fear; the shadow grew Till sea and sky were black; the bark plunged on And clove the blackness: then the fleece of cloud That bore me, melted, and I swooned and fell, And falling I awoke. Flos. Yes, Iolande, You're ever dreaming dreams, and when they're bad They're always about me. I too can dream, But otherwise than you. The God of dreams Who sleeps with me is blithe and debonnaire, Else should he not be partner of my bed. I dreamt I was a cat, and much caress'd And fed with dainty viands; there was cream And fish and flesh and porridge, but no mice; And I was fat and sleek, but in my heart There rose a long and melancholy mew Which meant, âI must have mice;â and therewithal I found myself transported to the hall Of an old castle, with the rapturous sound Of gnawing of old wainscot in my ears: With that I couch'd and sprang and sprang and couch'd, My soul rejoicing. Iolande. May God grant, dear Flos, Your mice shall not prove bloodhounds. That the veil Befits you not, I own; nor if you long In secular sort to love and be beloved Shall I reproach you; for if God denies The blessing of a heart espoused to Him His mercy wills that love should be fulfill'd In other kind, more mixed but still divine, Less happy but still rapt; and to this end In his own image he created Man. The love for Man I blame not; but oh, Flos! There are, though you may miss to see it, men Who have transform'd God's image in themselves Into another likeness. Flos. Iolande, You hate him; you have said soâ'tis enough. I love him; yes, and may my false heart perish That instant that it leaves to love as now. And if I thought this heart would so revolt, Or ere one sun had risen upon its shame, It should be buried without toll of bell Six fathom in the earth, and o'er its grave A letter'd stone should tell its terrible tale, And say it was a heart that, having fallen, Would rather rot below ground than above. Oh, take your arms awayâyou shall not kiss meâ Sweet Iolande, I know you wish me well, But is it wishing well to wish me false? Iolande. Not if your truth were plighted to the true. Flos. Whate'er his treasons he is true to me; True as the bravest of the brave in love; True as the lion that laid down its head O'ersway'd by love divine on Lectra's lap. Iolande. Deceived past rescue! Were it Vezelay, He is not good, but I believe him true, Know him but too devoted in his love; Were it but he! Flos. More kind is he than good, Poor mortal! Yet I love his love for me And him some little. Enter the Lady Abbess. Abbess. Well, my daughters dear, The Lord is good and gracious to this House; So is his Grace the Founder. Have you heard? He grants two masses daily for the soul Of Good Duke Philip, whom may God absolve! Truly his Grace's bounty knows no end, Such holy love he has for this poor House. Flos. Likewise its charming Abbess. Abbess. Naughty child! No more of that. Hark ye! the bell for Nocturns. Go, Iolande. For Flos, she stays with me, For I am ill and she a cheerful nurse. Mercy! such shootings in my back! Oh me! And such a shaking here! And then such qualms! And here a gurgling up! By God's good help, St. Bartlemy assisting, I have hope To struggle through the nightâbut not alone. Come, Flos, we'll sleep together. Bless my heart! Why, Flos is stricken too! How pale she looks! This frost will be the death of some poor souls; The Marne is frozen over. Come, sweet Flos. Scene III. âThe Rue Barbette, near the Porch of the Chapel of the Celestines. Raoul de Rouvroy, Ranulph de Roche-Baron, Henri de Fontenay, Antoine des Essars, and Charles de Savoisy, all armed. De Fontenay. What if she screams? De Rouvroy. Tell her the night is cold, And kindly tie a muffler o'er her mouth. De Fontenay. What if the Sisterhood scream all together? De Rouvroy. Run for your lives; but if you're deft and swift The Sisters will have pass'd within the walls Ere you shall scare them. Pupilage walks last. De Savoisy. But say the night-patrol should come this way. De Rouvroy. Then shall some two or three of you fall back And seem to fight; be desperate and loud, And whilst the watch is busy with your brawl, Montargis and his maid will mount and fly. If need be, set a house or two on fire, And shout amain for help. Enter Montargis from the Chapel. Montargis. Down with your vizors. God's curse upon that Priest and his discourse! When tenthly came, and twelfthly, and fifteenthly, I could have stabb'd him. Strangers too were there, Pilgrimsâwhat not? who may be meddlesome Unless discretion guide them. If they be They'll rue it. Ranulph, are the by-ways void? No stragglers? Des Essars. Right, Montargis; say a cat's grace That ever looks about her ere she eats. Montargis. Back, back, I say; stand back; I think they come. Enter from the Chapel the Nuns, preceded by the Priests and followed by the Novices and Pupils, after whom the Duke of Orleans, Henri de Vierzon, RenÃ© d'Aicelin, Enguerrand de Chevreuse, LorÃ© de Cassinel, and Alain Thibaut, in Pilgrim's weeds. The Priests and Nuns pass through the gates into the court of the Convent, whereupon Montargis advances. Montargis. My lady-love, you enter not; be wise; Despairing love dares all; you must be mine, And mine you are. Iolande. Yours! Wretch beyond all count The loathsomest that I know, I know you well, And hate you and defy you. Montargis. Nay, wild bird, We'll teach you sweeter singing. Iolande. Touch not me! Montargis. With softer touches shall I touch you soon; These rougher for this present you must brook. Orleans. First turn and touch another. Montargis. Who art thou That hold'st thy life so lightly? Beggar, back! Get hence! or if thou hungerest after death Pass forward but a step. Orleans. There is my foot. Montargis. And there thy death. Orleans. Well aim'd against well arm'd. Now, thy best ward. They fight. The other Burgundians come to the aid of Montargis, and are engaged by the Orleanists; Montargis is wounded and disarmed. Orleans. So! yield thee, Bastard. Montargis. Ha! thou know'st me? Well; If to a Knight I yield. Orleans. A Knight and more. Montargis. Say'st thou âand more?â Orleans. More, by St. Paul! Montargis. My Lord, That voice and oath chiming together thus Tell forth your title to respect. I yield. My friends, put up your swords. My own lies there. We will withdraw, if so the victor wills. Orleans. Go, and be wiser. Keep your council. I, For his sake who befriends, will not betray you. [Exeunt Montargis and his friends. Orleans. Unbar the gate. De Vierzon. 'Tis fast within. Holla! Within there! Ho! Unbolt the gate. The Porter (within). Get hence, Ye graceless knaves, get hence! De Vierzon. Unbolt the gate; Here is a maiden of your House has swoon'd. The Porter. So has the general Sisterhood. Get hence, Lewd villains that ye are! De Vierzon. Out, Thickskull, out! Orleans (supporting Iolande). Frighten'd to death I hastily had thought, But ne'er did womanish fear put on a face Of such celestial sovereignty as this. Rather the motions of the bodily life O'ermaster'd by the passion of her scorn. Open that gate. De Vierzon. 'Tis easily said, my Lord; But here's a Lackbrain keeps it barr'd. Orleans. Then stave it. How fare you, Lady? Iolande. Well, I thank you, well; Though dumb when fain a grateful heart would speak As with a thousand tongues, and fill the world With thanks and praise; but there is God to aid, Who pays all dues. Orleans. Sweet Lady, when God grants That praise from such a mouth ennobles me, He showers His choicest blessing. They within Must pardon us some violence, for else, Through error of their fear, this sturdy gate Should have repulsed its own. Iolande. Brave Sirs, farewell! And though 'tis little that poor Nuns can do To show their sense of service, there is one As great in power as heart, the princely Duke Our founder, who will value at its worth A service to the Celestines. Orleans. My friends, I wish you joy; and with this lady's leave I'll wait on her to-morrow, so to learn What guerdon you may look for. Iolande. Heartily The Lady Abbess and myself will strive To do you grace and honour. Pray you, Sirs, Stay by the gate till I shall cross the court, For all have fled indoors and it is void. [Exit. Orleans. Now to our beds. Sirs, what she said I swear; A service to the Celestines I prize At a knight's fee to each. To bed, to bed, To dream of such a voice as in my ears Sounds like a Seraph's in a song of praise. Enter the Watch. Sergeant of the Watch. Haro! Haro! What's here! Stand, villains, stand! Clashings of swords and screamings for the Watch! How dare ye! To the guard-house every man. De Vierzon. Off! laggards, we were keepers of the law, Not breakers; we but filled a gap for you. We fought with certain caitiffs who were fain To ravish hence a maid; we rescued her; For them, they slank away. Sergeant. Fie! tell not me! We'll have no ravishings nor no rescues here; No ravishings nor rescues can be suffer'd After the Watch is set. To the guard-house, come. If maidens shall be ravish'd and be rescued It is the Watch must do it. Come, ye rogues. De Vierzon. Stand off, old Owlet. The Sergeant. What! the manacles! Ho! D' Aicelin. Away, ye Clot-pole-catchpoles! Hence, away! [The Duke and his friends drive out the Watch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âThe Court of the House of the Bastard of Montargis. The Bastard of Montargis and his two Squires, Raoul de Rouvroy and Ranulph de Roche-Baron. Montargis. The house I speak of bears above the porch An image of our Lady; old and batter'd Are house and image both: none dwells within Save a bald porter, old and batter'd too. Let his old ears inform him I have need To store some wine that comes to me from Bourg, And hire the house; give him whate'er he asks; Then cask these weapons that I tell you of And take them thither. On this roll is writ The names of certain of my men at arms; Call them together; hold them on the wing, And after nightfall drop them one by one Into that house. Then keep them fast and close, And till I come,âmayhap to-morrow night, Early or late,âlet no man pass the door. Be secret, ye and they. [Exit. De Roche-Baron. What may this mean? De Rouvroy. Mischief it means, if I have ears. Tomorrow Will be St. Clement's Eve. The Bastard walks In the world's eye untroubled, but in heart He bears his Monday night's discomfiture As new caged tigers bear captivity. Some bird has whistled that the booty wrench'd From him, has fallen to that crowing Duke, Whom if he hated humanly before He hates with hatred more than human now. With that he broods upon a prophecy Which babbles of St. Clement's Eve, and tells How on that night the gutters shall run blood, And lilies redden in the morning sun. There is an ancient picture too, wherein St. Clement, with the anchor round his neck, Sinks and draws with him underneath the wave A knotted staff, twined with the Fleur de Lys, And holding on its point a porcupine Enscrolled with âFar and Near,â the Duke's device: And hearten'd by these figurings and sings He holds the time auspicious. De Roche-Baron. But Duke Johnâ Him must we carry with us; without him I hardly deem St. Clement will suffice To hold us harmless. True, revenge is sweet, And neither thou nor I have cause to love His Grace of Orleans; but revenge were mad Without the one Duke's warrant and support, In case of need, to practise on the other. De Rouvroy. Trust to the Bastard to draw in Duke John. He's forward in a scheme for melting down This newly-solder'd fellowship of the Duke's. He's gone even now to put it in the pot Of those two Monk-magicians. As for me, My lot is cast with his; whither he dares, Thither I follow. De Roche-Baron. With Duke John to boot, I say the same. De Rouvroy. No question of Duke John; No question but he'll lead him like a lamb. Scene II. âAn Apartment in the ChÃ¢teau St. Antoine furnished with a brazen head fixed on a skeleton, crystal globes, magic mirrors, and celestial squares.â Father Buvulan and Father Betizac. Father Buvulan. For a brief moment I was high in hope They both would burn. Truly he singed his beard In saving of his barber. Father Betizac. Well, it shakes us. Unstable is the commonalty ever; The Duke had but to tickle them with tropes, And Passac was their chuck, their duck, their darling, Their Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, That in our heathen fire had walk'd unhurt. Oh 'tis a fickle and a foolish people! Their faith is with success; who faileth falleth. When we lost hold of Passac, we lost hold Of credit and repute. De Montenay Sends me his greeting, and he has no need Of the enchanted armour. There's a loss Of some five hundred crowns. De Graville's page Comes with his cozening master's countermand, Who cares not that his horoscope be cast Till better timesâGod grant his best be bad! Since Tuesday there has been nor maid nor youth To spy their spousals in the magic mirror. All day the knocker sleeps upon the door As it were dead. What! now it stirs. Come in. Enter the Bastard of Montargis. Montargis. So! Reverend Fathers! winters such as these Make fuel dear; 'tis cruel to the poor To waste the store; when next ye light your fire Look that there's something on the spit to roast. Father Buvulan. His Grace of Orleans in his brotherly love May, if it please him, set all traitors free To do their devilish work upon the King. Our part right loyally have we fulfill'd, And stand acquitted. Montargis. In your consciences,â Yes doubtless in your tender consciences Ye stand acquitted; but elsewhere how stand ye? The Duke, who snatch'd away his friend the Barber,â So seasonably, just as his wig was frizzled,â Think ye with him ye stand acquitted? No, Beware his wrath. And let me tell you, friends, This frizzling of a barber doth but clinch A foregone condemnation. Have ye heard How ye were handled at the Council-board? Your very eyes and noses could not 'scape, But seeing that they did not please the Duke, Plain documents were they of your damnation Confirm'd in Satan's signature and seal. To my poor thinking, Sirs, His Grace's speech Savour'd of pitch and resin. Ye best know (For through affection and a burning zeal Ye are well seen in fagots and the stake) If it be pleasant to ascend the skies In manner of an incense; but if not, I counsel you to find some present shift For dwelling in the flesh. Father Betizac. Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Oh God be merciful! What mean you, Sir? Know you of aught devised and put in hand Against our lives? Montargis. Of what I know, my friends, I tell you what I may. Father Betizac. Oh, Sir, sweet Sir, What may be done? Befriend us in our need. Will gold redeem us? We have here laid by, Out of our honest earnings, a round sum In crown and ducats; will it please you take And use it at your pleasure? Montargis. No, Sirs, no; Gold will do nothing; ye must find a friend To match a foe so mighty; who is he? One only Lord there is, one only Prince, Of such sufficiency as to ward the blows Of the King's brother. Give yourselves to him Bravely and wholly. Danger is a dog That follows if ye fly, flies if ye face him. Father Buvulan. Surely his Highness knows us for his own. Oh, excellent Sir, commend us to his Grace; We wait upon his every wish and word. Montargis. Commend yourselves by service. Well ye know, If aught your art avails you, who it is That by his damnable practice hath let loose These troops of demons that torment the King,â A sin by so much worse than fratricide As hell is worse than death; ye know it well; It is the Duke his brother. What ye know That daringly declare, and ye are safe. Father Buvulan. Oh, Sir, it was but reverence and respect For the Blood-Royal muzzled us till now; But at his Grace's honourable bidding The truth must be declared. Montargis. His Grace's bidding? The servant who doth only what is bidden Shall earn but scant reward. He that divines His master's need and feeds it, serves him twice; Serves him with head and hand and heart and will; This is the saving service. Father Buvulan. Sir, 'tis well; This service we will render, and the truth Unflinchingly avouch. Montargis. Truth is a gem Of countless price; and life too is worth something. Once more the Council in its wisdom meets To vex the question of the King's disease; Ye shall attend it. Come meantime with me; A little of my teaching will ye want Ere ye proceed adepts in speaking truth. Scene III. âThe Convent of the Celestines. Nuns and Novices at work embroidering vestments and altar-cloths. 1st Novice. I was next before Iolande, and heard a kind of soft scuffle behind, and, turning round, I missed her; and oh! woe is me! I cried, there is a maid gone and it might have been I! And I looked through the grating, and there he stood, a tall man and a beautiful bachelor. He bade the other touch him if he dared; and there were words and oaths, and when they drew their swords I squealed and ran away. 1st Nun. Ay, and it was time, too. Who taught thee to look at a man through a grating? 1st Novice. Nobody, Mother; I was looking for Iolande. 1st Nun. Then do so no more. If a maid look through a grating what may she not see? Peradventure the Grand Turk and all his Janissaries, and I know not what masquings and mummeries; or the six Satyrs which danced at the widow's wedding with no more clothing than a beast's, and by God's providence took fire and were burnt; all except his gracious Majesty, whom God preserve! 2nd Nun. Yes, Sister, there was another saved; which was Jean de Nantouillet; seeing he flung himself into a trough of water which was there for cooling of the wine, and calling upon St. Winifred, she endowed the water with that virtue that it quenched the flames. 1st Nun. But saidst thou a tall man, eh! and with a long nose? 1st Novice. Tall, Mother; and for his nose, it may be long or may not, as it pleases God; for there was but a small matter of moonlight to see it by. But he was not a Turk, which has tusks, they say, like a boar; nor a Satyr, which is shaggy. 2nd Novice. Twice since has a tall man come hither by the garden gate that was left open for him. I saw him through the casement in the dormitory. 2nd Nun. Fie! fie! This looking out of casements is unseemly. Marcian looked out of a casement and she saw a little boy with a bow and arrow, which was a heathen and shot at her. Was he a fair-faced man with blue eyes and a light-brown beard? 2nd Novice. I know not, Mother, for his hat was drawn over his brows, and he held his kerchief to his face as though he had the toothache. 3rd Nun. Marry, and I'll warrant you God sent a toothache no sooner than he deserved. And if I were Abbess there should be no leaving open of gates for sinners to come in with their blue eyes and their brown beards. 4th Nun. Yea, and their rapiers at their sides like leopards, gaping and prancing up the walks that one knows not which way to turn for them. 5th Nun. No more prating and prattling. Come, Marceline, sing us one of thy holy songs, which is better than our babblement. 3rd Novice. I will sing you the song of the Knight and the Dragon. From men that naughty are and rude, Save us, St. Gregory and St. Jude. Amen. It begins so, Mother, and then it tells what happened. 5th Nun. Go on, child; truly 'tis a good beginning, and very necessary. 3rd Novice. A good Knight, hight Sir Vantadour, Got on his horse and rode an hour; Out of the city he rode amain, And came to a forest that stood on a plain. So full of wild beasts was that wood, Enter it no man durst nor could; And those that did in twain were cleft, And eaten up till nothing was left. Through the wood the Knight rode forth For half a day, from south to north; When, lo ! a Dragon he descried, And on its back a Lady astride. That Dame and Dragon were akin, Pride was he and she was Sin; The Dragon hiss'd and rear'd his crest, The good Knight laid his lance in rest. âBeware,â said Sin, âfor Pride is strong, And mighty to uphold the wrong; And woe to those that him attack, Hissing, with me upon his back.â The Knight he rode a-tilt and smote The scaly Dragon in his throat; The Dragon writhed and hiss'd and spat, But nowise blench'd the Knight thereat. Then call'd the Dragon from six caves Six Blackamoors that were his slaves; The Knight bade each and all advance, And featly slew them with his lance. Likewise the Dragon. Sin the while No longer frown'd, but seem'd to smile; And called six Syrens fair to sight, Who flung their arms around the Knight. But back he stepp'd, and âLo!â said he, âTo fight with maids is not for me; I know to fight where fame is won, But now best courage is to run.â So first he fought, and then he ran, Sir Vantadour, that righteous man: And we from his ensample learn, To flee from Sin and Pride to spurn. Holy St. Gregory, grant us grace To spurn at Sin and spit in her face. Amen. 6th Nun. Well, I pray God and St. Gregory that Sin come no way near us, nor a Dragon neither; and if one shall come that is not Sin nor a Dragon, what I say is, he should not come muffled up and no one to see the face of him. 5th Nun. Past a doubt this Knight which comes once and again is the same which snatched Iolande from the hands of the spoiler. 3rd Nun. Which some will say was sore against her will, for all her scuffling and screeching. I am a guileless woman that thinks no ill; but if ever such a thing happens to me, I shall not stand screeching away to no purpose, I think not indeed. I shall not stand waiting for any chance of a passer-by just to fall out of one man into another. 5th Nun. St. Mary, Sister, it is not for such as thou and I to stand in dread of these dangers. 3rd Nun. Who knows? It is true God has been good to me for sixty years and upwards, but I were too bold to count upon his mercies as though they were never to fail me. Enter a fourth Novice. 4th Novice. I vow there is the same man again, coming in through the garden gate. 3rd Nun. The same again! Fearful! This must be looked to; I must see to this. [Exit. 1st Nun. We must all see to it, we that wear the veil. What is this hurry-skurry! Keep back, Novices; it is not for you .... Nay, young legs! They're all gone before one can cross oneself. [Exeunt. Enter the Lady Abbess and Father Renault. The Abbess. A woeful plight, poor sinner, woefulâ yesâ Poor Flos! I told her it would come to this. Poor soul! she never heeded me, no more Than had I been a magpie or a chough. Father Renault. That woeful is her plight I well believe, And hear with hope; the woefuller the better; So woe shall work to weal. The Abbess. Pray God it may! Pary God you bring it so to work! God grant it! But what it works to now is bad to worse. She hates him with a passion and a heat More senseless than she loved him with before; And take my word for 'tâof a truth you mayâ I know her well, and she may sit and sulk And spare to speak, but well I know her thoughtsâ And take my word for 't she is dangerous; She's brooding, and there's somewhat will be hatch'd; And she has thoseâI say not who they beâ At her behest who'll do a deed of blood For love or lucre; and what scandal then Should light upon this holy House and me And all of us. I pray you press it home; Enjoin her if she harbour in her soul Bad thoughts of malice and revenge, to speak, And bid her upon pain of her soul's death Put them away. Father Renault. Else shall she not be shriven. Go, summon her and send her to confession. By this example we may mark how swift The transformation whereby carnal love Is changed to carnal hate. I have heard it said, There is no haunt the viper more affects Than the forsaken bird's-nest. In the Chapel I shall await her; send her to me there. The Abbess. She's there already and expects you. Father Renault. Good. My part accomplished, it will then be yours To hold her well in hand. [Exit. The Abbess. So; gone at last. The Duke is late; or is he hiding? Oh! My gracious Lord! Enter Orleans. Orleans. Good Abbess, my good friend, Where is she? Noânot hereânor coming? Nay, Is her thank-offering of yesterday, Her hand to kiss, the sum? The Abbess. My gracious Lord, That were but little. Orleans. Abbess, say you so? You think I ran some hazard of my life; It was not much; but by the Lord of Life If twenty lives were mine to put in pledge And on each life were twenty kingdoms staked, Laugh they that laughter love, that hand to kiss Should countervail them. The Abbess. Oh, my Lord, I blush To hear such things. Orleans. No need, good Abbess, none. I am not what I was. Her saintly grace Hath wrought a miracle and made of me, Whole sinner that I was, now half a saint. I think you scarce believe it, but 'tis true; That quest I told you ofâthat sacred quest Touching the king,âis all my errand now: Tell her for holy ends I humbly crave To be admitted to her presence. The Abbess. Nay, My gracious Lord, it pleases you to waive Your royal state; but it befits not me To be forgetful. She is near at hand: She shall attend you. Orleans. But no word, I pray, Of who or what I am. The Abbess. My gracious Lord, She does not, and she shall not, even surmise, If I can help it, till your Grace give leave, The honour that is hers. [Exit. Orleans. When soul meets soul I crave a riddance of my royalties. Save those that wear them, there are none can know The leaden hand they lay upon the hearts Of whosoe'er approaches, numb and dumb, That else were sprightly, fervent, fond and free. But wherefore do I wish her free and fond? And is it but the Devil's self within Assures me she has power to cast him out, So to betray us both? No, verily, Should the unholy ghost entice my soul From this its holy purpose, she herself Would rescue and redeem it. Enter Iolande. Fairest friend, Is it too soon I come again? Iolande. Too soon? Orleans. It would not seem so were my mission told. Have I seemed slow to tell it? Then believe 'Tis that I loved to linger in the joys That herald what is grave. Iolande. You speak of joys, And then you speak of that which is not joy. What else it is I know not; nor can I guess Why you, that have the splendours of the world (So thinks the Abbess) in your choice, should choose To haunt this dim retreat. Orleans. If dim it be, It's dimness is divine. In years long past I sought and found another dim retreat; And shall I tell you where? Iolande. Tell what you will. Orleans. Once in a midnight marchâ'twas when the war With Brittany broke outâtired with the din And tumult of the host, I left the road, And in the distant cloisters of a wood Dismounted and sat down. The untroubled moon Kept through the silent skies a cloudless course, And kiss'd and hallow'd with her tender light Young leaf and mossy trunk; and on the sward Black shadows slumber'd, softly counterchanged With silver bars. Majestic and serene, I said, is Nature's night, and what is Man's? Then from the secret heart of some recess Gush'd the sweet nocturns of that serious bird Whose love-note never sleeps. With glad surprise Her music thrill'd the bosom of the wood, And like an angel's message enter'd mine. Why wander back my thoughts to that night march? Can you divine? or must I tell you why? The worlds without this precinct and within Are to my heart,âthe one the hurrying march With riot, outrage, ribaldry, and noise Insulting night,âthe other, deep repose That listens only to a heaven-taught song And throbs with gentlest joy. Iolande. What march was that? Said you, the Breton War? You follow'd then The banner of the founder of this House, His Grace of Orleans. He is brave, they say, But wild of life, and though abounding oft In works of grace and penitence, yet as oft Lapsing to sin, and dangerous even to those His bounty shelter'd. Orleans. By his enemies All this is said, and more. Are you then one? Iolande. Nay, I know nothing save the gossiping tales That flit like bats about these convent walls Where twilight reigns. Gladly would I believe Our Founder faultless if I might; but you, Living in courts and camps, must know him well. Orleans. He is not faultless. Iolande. Are his faults as grave As tattling tongues relate? Orleans. They're grave enough. Iolande. Are you then to be number'd in the file Of the Duke's enemies? Orleans. Indeed I am: Not one has hurt him more. Iolande. What is your name? The Abbess vowsâwhat I but scantly creditâ She knows it not. May I not know it? No? She says you are of credit with the Court, And hope through certain ministries of ours With holy relics, to restore to health One whom the Founder loves. Orleans. Soon will you know Mine errand and my name; the last too soon; It is well known to calumny; when heard, It may be you will bid the gates be barred, And banish me your presence? Iolande. Never. No, If calumny assail you, much the more Be gratitude intent to do you right. That you are true and generous and brave Not all the falsehood all the world can forge Shall sunder from my faith. Orleans. Yet is there more. I said that calumny had soil'd my name, Which is a truth; but bitterer truth's behind; My life deserves not that my name stand clear; I claim but to be true; save loyalty Few gifts of grace are mine. Iolande. But you are young, And you will grow in grace. Orleans. It should be so; But hardly may I dare to say it will. I came upon a holy mission hither; Yet something but half holy in my heart Detains my tongue from telling it. Iolande. Your words Are strangely dark. I guess not what they mean And almost fear to ask. I know but little; Yet know that there are dangers in the world I have but heard of. May I trust in you? Oh that 'twere possible to trust in you With boundless and inalterable faith! Oh that 'twere possible to cast my soul On you as on the pillar of its strength! But you, too, you are weak; you say you are; And only God is strong, and in His strength And in none other strength may strength be found, And in His love and in none other love His child may win an unbewildering love, Love without danger, measureless content. Leave her to seek it there. Orleans. Oh, Iolande! I love youâyet to say so is a sin; And such a sin as only such a love And veriest inebriety of heart Can palliate or excuse. An earthly bond, Earthly as it was woven of earthly aims By heedless hands when I was but a child, Yet sacred as it binds me to a wife,â This earthly sacred bond forbids my soul To seek the holier and the heavenlier peace It might have found with you. Iolande. Go back, go back. I knew not you were married; back to your wife; Leave meâforget meâGod will give me strength; There yet is time, for I am innocent still, And now each moment gathers guilt. Begone; Nor ever come again, nor ever again Wrong her you speak of, as you did but now In saying you love me. Orleans. Yet loving you I love not her the less,âsurely not less; Nay with a pitying love I love her more; And pitying love shall have a heavenlier home. For even in the instant I beheld your face All that this glorious earth contains of good, As in a new creation, freshly, strangely, Reveal'd itself, borne in upon my soul; And since the mandate which created light And eyes not mortal then beheld God's works Not then defaced, no eye of man hath seen So fair an apparition as appear'd This earth to me. Iolande. Home to your wife,âgo home. Your heart betrays itself and truth and me. You know not love, speaking of love for two. I knew not love till now; and love and shame Have flung themselves upon me both at once. One will be with me to my death I know; The other not an hour. Oh, brave and true And loyal as you are, from deadly wrong You rescued me, now rescue me from shame; For shame it is to hear you speak of love, And shame it is to answer you with tears That seem like softness: but my trust is this, That in myself I trust not,ânor in you, Save only if you trust yourself no more And fly from sin. Orleans. More precious to my soul Is your affiance, though with stern reserves, Than ever soft surrender wild to meet Love's wildest wish; nor will I longer dare, Uplifted by the rapture of the time Entrancing me from insight, to forget That what is heavenliest in our mortal moods Is not as fix'd and founded as the heavens. Yet do I dread to leave you, leaving thus My name the victim of all vile reports Which, when you hear it, you will hear. Iolande. Noâno. The evil you have spoken of yourself I will believe, and not a breath beside. Orleans. I ask no moreâno moreâoh, nothing more; Not for one tone of that too tender voice, Not for one touch of that transparent hand; No, nothing for myself ... Voices without. What! Iolande: Enter two Novices. 1st Novice. Oh! cry you mercy! Are you not alone? Iolande. You knew I was not. 2nd Novice. Well, perhaps we did; But 'tis no fault of ours, for we were sent. The Sisters want you in the Founder's chapel To deck the altar for St. Clement's Eve; And Father Renault tells us first and last None knows so well to twine the mimic flowers And Nature's broidery to counterfeit. 1st Novice. Old Sister Martha, mounting the ladder, tried, We handing up the flowers; but from her hold Thrice fell the fleur-de-lys; and she, poor soul! Was seized with trembling and would try no more. She said it was unlucky. Orleans. It was strange. 1st Novice. Yes, truly, Sir, it scared us. 2nd Novice. Worse ensued; For in her fright the ladder she o'erthrew, Which struck the Founder's banner in its fall, And that fell too. Orleans. That fell before its time; If ancient prophecy may win belief That should have waited for St. Clement's Eve. 2nd Novice. Sir, you say true. Come, Iolande; they wait. Iolande. I will be there anon. So tell them. [Exeunt the two Novices. Orleans. This I said, and I will say it once again, That for myself I ask nor word nor look That speaks of more than pardon. What remains Is but to name mine errand and begone. For one far worthier than myself I crave A boon that in the holiest human pity You may confer. A brother whom I love,â Whom all men love,âa treasure-house of weal For France and me,âin his behalf I ask What none but you can give. Sorely his soul Is wrung and tortured by the terrible power Of evil spirits, ever and anon Re-entering his body through the gaps Of faltering faith and intermitted prayer, When struggling nature wearied with the strife Yields a brief vantage. Iolande. He shall have my prayers; 'Twill be my sorrow's solace when you're gone To pray for one you love. Orleans. And did you know, In health how kind he is, how good and just, In anguish how unutterably tried, You'd pray with tears. Iolande. I never pray without; But they shall flow from deeper depths for him. Orleans. For prayers I askâfor prayers and something more. A vial is there in the Bernardins Which holds a relic of transcendant price, The tears of Mary Magdalene, let fall Then when she stood before the tomb of Christ Ere Christ appear'd; an Angel as they fell Caught them, and later gave them to St. John In Patmos; to St. Bernard from St. John Successive Saints devolved them; and such power Is theirs, that should a virgin whom no sin Nor sinful thought hath violated, dip Her finger in them, calling Christ to aid, And trace upon the brow of one possess'd The figure of the Cross, the unclean spirit Will instantly depart; and never more To one so fortified can fiend or imp Make good his entrance. Now you know what boon In what behalf I beg. Iolande. Am I the maid That may do this? Oh, would that I were worthy! But if no holier hath the call, then I, Beseeching God of His abounding grace To give sufficiency, will work in faith. Orleans. His blessing then upon your work and you! I will betake me to the Bernardins, Where is enshrined the relic. Once again, But in the hallowing presence of a rite More solemn than a service for the dead, We meet; and then, if so your conscience wills, We part for ever. Iolande. Once and no more. Orleans. Meanwhile The Lady Abbess will instruct you more Touching myself, my Brother, and the weight And import of your task. [Exit. Enter the Lady Abbess. Abbess. Well, pretty one; You know not yet what crown of honour ... Yes, And worthily you wear itâhere's a colour! I wonder if my cheeks will e'er again Glow like a meteor, and my dangerous eyes Throw out blue lights .. believe me once they could. Well! there's a time for all things! I protest You look so stately and so lifted up I think you know what Knight you have in hand; I think he told you. Iolande. No, dear Lady-Mother; Nor do I greatly care. How brave he is, How kind, how generous, how great of heart, I knowâwhat care I for his name? Abbess. Good child, Say not you care not till you know. What, what! I will not tell you if you say you care not. Now do you care? Iolande. Yes, I believe I do. Who is he? Abbess. Louis, by the Grace of God Of Orleans, Valois, Blois, and Beaumont Duke, Count of Touraine! Hi! hi! Beshrew thy heart! The red blood ebbs amain; the fleur-de-lys Has beaten back the roses. Iolande. Oh! my Mother! Then he whose malady I am charged to cure,â He is the King! Oh Mother, yes, I knowâ âA treasure-house of weal to France and him;â He said to France. Mother, no hour shall fly, No minute that I shall not pass in prayer. Send for the Hermit; tell him in the chapel I shall be found. Abbess. Well, well, my child, I will. Scene IV. âAnother Apartment in the Convent.âFlos de Flavy and Raiz de Vezelay. Flos. Talk not to me of love; I loathe its name More than blue plague or the unburied corse That none dares touch. Give me thy hand; I have it; But is it mine? De Vezelay. For ever and for ever! Flos. Mine for all work that I shall put it to? De Vezelay. In all submission thine. Flos. Now give me this; [Draws his dagger from its sheath. Thy dagger's haft is fashion'd to a cross, As though for handling by some Christian Knight Apt to avenge a woman. Vain pretence! Oh empty emblem! Out of date in France. What dagger now leaps lightly from its sheath Save in a tavern brawl? De Vezelay. Now by my soul You do us less than justice. Women's wrongs Find yet in France avengers. Flos. Is it so? Then swear upon this Cross to prove it so. Swear to avenge me, and be swift to strikeâ I say not whom, lest naming of his name My lips be wither'd and my human speech Turn'd to a serpent's hiss. De Vezelay. That do I swear; And by what's holiest in the heart of man I hold myself herein God's minister Of wrath and judgment, and your will as His. Flos. Give me thy hand again. It is too white. I dedicate this hand to truth and love, And hatred and revenge. White as mine own! Dye it and bring it back to me to-morrow, And I will clasp it to my heart. Farewell. Scene V. âThe Council Chamber.âThe King, the Duke of Orleans, the Duke of Burgundy, the Archbishop of Sens, and other councillors; the Bastard of Montargis, the Abbot of the Bernardins, the Captain of the King's Guard, and others in attendance. Orleans. The worthy Abbot here, my Lords, will vouch It has been tried a hundred times and more Nor e'er found wanting. Abbot. Never yet, my Lords. The last demoniac who was dispossess'd Was one from Vermandois,âa damsel plagued With many devils, that she raved and shriek'd And tore her clothes. A virgin of St. Cloud Dipping a finger sign'd her, whereupon A volley of blue sparks flew from her mouth, Then crows and winged serpents; and with that She dropp'd her arms and knelt, and praising God, Gave thanks for her deliverance like a lamb. Orleans. You hear. Since which she rests inviolate. Enough, Lord Abbot: we will weigh your words. [Exit the Abbot of the Bernardins. Burgundy. May it please your Majesty, I question not But that the tears shall work for good; they may; But this should hinder not that means be sought To track these devils home to them they serve; And these sagacious Monks, as I am told, Have now their noses on the slot. They wait To tell their tidings. Ho there! bring them in. [Exit Montargis. Orleans. For me, my Lords, as soon would I consult With Satan's self as with his mimes and minions; But since they please my Cousin, let them come. I thinkâwhat smell is this?âthey're not far off. Re-enter Montargis with Father Buvulan and Father Betizac. Burgundy. Rise, holy Fathers; say to my Lord the King How speeds your quest? Archbishop. But first, I pray you, tell Whether it be by sorcery ye work, Or holier ways. Father Buvulan. My Lord Archbishop, no; 'Tis not by sorcery; but as Moses wrought His wonders, and by Jannes and by Jambres, Egyptians and Sorcerers, was misdeem'd To be a Sorcerer like themselves, so we By Sorcerers and their crew are Sorcerers call'd, But by the faithful faithful. For our art, We draw it from the holiest source, a book Which God to Adam for his solace gave When he had wept a hundred years for Abel. He that shall read this volume when the Moon Conjoins with Jupiter in the Dragon's head, Shall know of secret counsels that are hatch'd In Satan's kingdom. Orleans. In what language, Sir, Is this book written? Father Buvulan. That which was used, my Lord, In Paradise. Orleans. Who taught it you? Father Buvulan. My Lord, The Book I speak of teaches it. Burgundy. Well, well; To the purpose. Say, if ye know, what man Sends by his execrable art these fiends To vex the King, himself a fouler fiend Than any that obey him. Father Betizac. Honour'd Lords, We know, but dare not tell. Burgundy. How! dare not tell! How dare ye to be silent if ye know? Father Betizac. My Lord, so loth are we to deem it true, Although we know it, we would fain believe Our art this once betrays us. Burgundy. Tush! no words, Or words of weight; no trifling, Friars, here. Speak to the point, or take your hummings hence. Father Betizac. Oh, Sirs, but it is perilous to accuse Men in high places! 'twere an ill return For our outspoken fearless honesty Should we lie open to the vengeful strokes Of guilty greatness; and we humbly crave Some warrantise that what we're bid to speak Spoken shall bring no jeopardy of life Or liberty or goods. Burgundy. Now look ye, Friars; I've heard you heretofore with patience; yes, With singular patience, bred of that respect In which I hold you, so far I have heard you. But I am not a Saint; patience has bounds: And if ye do not instantly speak out, By God I'll have your heads. Father Buvulan. Ah! my good Lord, You deal too hardly with our just intent; But being so bidden we must needs obey Though it may cost us dear. My Lord, the man Who to our sorrowing insight was reveal'd The worker of this evil on the King Stands in this presence on the King's right hand, His Grace the Duke of Orleans. Orleans. Death and Hell! Ye felon Monks, accuse ye me? Archbishop. My Lords, This is plain blasphemyâthese men blasphemeâ My Lords, these men, I say these men, my Lords,â Orleans. These men, Archbishop? Venomous snakes, not men; Fell vipers hissing through the mask of Monks. Detestable Apostates, come ye here, Yea to the face and front of Majesty, To trample on the Royal blood of France! Rear up thy head, thou sacrilegious snake, Ope thy white lips and spit that lie again In the King's face. Archbishop. I say, my Lords, once more, These men profane this presence, speaking words That are most impious, and unfit to utter, And I may add, untrue, and very fearful, Transgressing and o'erleaping, so to say, Those bounds of modesty which good men honour, Insomuch that I verily stand amazed. Orleans. I say no more. I am ashamed to waste Good honest anger on a reptile's sting, Or scold at kites and jackdaws. Sir my Brother, I deign not to reply to this foul charge, But leave it to your justice. The King. They shall die, Yea, instantly, an ignominious death. Ho! Captain of the Guard, arrest these Monks. [The Guard is called in and the Monks pinioned. My ever loving and belovÃ¨d Brother, Who from our earliest years hast been to me A staff and stay,âmy dear delight in weal, My solace in affliction,âbe it known Who strikes at thy fair fame strikes at my heart, And as a traitor to the realm and me Shall suffer death. Father Betizac. Oh mercy! spare our lives! My honour'd Lord of Burgundy, save us, save us. Burgundy. I save you! Take them hence. Orleans. But first, a word; Of your own malice, though as deep as hell, Ye have not learnt this lesson. Tell from whom, Beside the Devil, ye derived it; tell, And I myself may plead for you. Father Buvulan. My Lord, You are most merciful and a Christian man. We were assured his Grace of Burgundy Knew more of this than we. Orleans. My cousin John! Burgundy. What, I, ye miscreant jugglers! Montargis. Take them henceâ Off with themâoff! and gag them, lest their lies Should spread amongst the people. Father Betizac. Base, false Knight! [The Monks are gagged and carried off. Burgundy. My royal Cousin, what has moved these Monks To mingle me with their malignities, I do protest I know not. Before God I am as innocent of this wrong to you As when my mother whelp'd me. The King. Doubt it not, My noble Brother. Think not that our Cousin, Who did but yesterday at the altar's foot, In token of a life-long good accord, Partake with you the Bread of Life and Love, Would ever so surrender his purged spirit To evil counsels as to soil himself With perfidies like these. Orleans. I well believe it; And do as freely from my heart absolve My Cousin of complicity in this,â Yea with a faith as absoluteâas myself Of that I'm charged with. I would not believe A cat had stolen my cream upon the oath Of two such knaves as these; how should I then Believe for them my royal Cousin wrought To poison my good name? He did it not; No, by the honour of the Fleur de Lys, He did it not. My pledge I here renew Of friendship and alliance. Burgundy. And I mine; Here is my hand. Orleans. So be it. Now, my Lords, Our day's work thus determined, God be with you! With your good leave, my Brother. The King. Lords, farewell; Our Brother, as we think, will wish us with him. [Exeunt the King and the Duke of Orleans. Burgundy. I crave a word of counsel ere we part: We see, Sirs, how no week can pass but breeds Some new device for healing of the King; And what we now have witness'd proffers proof How easily in this good men may err, The dupes of knavish craft. Touching these tears, My cousin may be right or may be wrong; Certes his purpose and intent is good; But that his counsellors and instruments Are unimpeachable, demands a doubt: The Abbot of the Bernardins, I hear, Is but a wily and a slippery saint; And for my cousin's virgin, who but knows What manner of maids they be that trade with him. Then for the tears; there is another bottle, Shrined in the Convent of St. Genevieve, Which some think is the truer. How this be I know not; but I know it is not meet Such things be hazarded in wantonness; And to this end it is I ask your aid. I deem that whoso shall essay such things, If harm should follow, howsoe'er excused, Should expiate the issue with their lives. So rash attempts shall fitly be foreslowen, And none shall tamper with the King's disease Save those that in themselves and in their means Have a full faith. Hold up your hands for âYea.â [All hands are holden up. It is decreed. I will not keep you now. Farewell. Montargis, stay with me. Farewell. [Exeunt all but the Duke of Burgundy and the Bastard of Montargis. Well, this is strange, Montargis; by St. George I nothing know what made those Monks so bold; They had no cue from me. Montargis. And by the Dragon I'll swear it was the truth that made them bold; For certain is it what they said was true; The King's bedevill'd by the Duke, no other; Men do not deal in dangerous crimes for nought, And who but he could profit? Burgundy. Who but he? Let but the King be kept incapable, He thinks to rule supreme. Montargis. And for what cause Saved he up Passac, whose infernal arts Compass the King from hour to hour? Burgundy. But why The Monks should be so desperate for the truth At forfeit of their heads ... Montargis. That craves reply. Why true then,âlet me see. Faith! they were stung At the Duke's meddling with their roast, the barber, And, taking count he would avenge him, reckon'd Their vengeance should have won the race of his. Burgundy. And when their reckonings ran them on a rock They hail'd to me, beshrew them! It is well My Cousin seems to think no evil. Montargis. Seems. Burgundy. Not honest, think'st thou, in his seeming? Montargis. Nay, Your Highness searches men with inquisition Subtler than mine. You're positive the Monks No warrant had from you. I that am bound To know you nice and scrupulous of speech, May swear to what you say. But who beside Will take it for a truth that men so mean And lowly of condition would thus dare To put their quarrel with a potent Prince To mortal issue, save at his behest Who only is more powerful still? 'Tis vain To dream the Duke, or any man, howe'er He mask the vengeful battery of his thoughts, Acquits you in his heart; 'tis not in man To hold you innocent; and if you deem The Duke so minded, you are lull'd to sleep, That so the dagger of a dire revenge May waken you to death. Burgundy. By Anthony's cap I swear I had no part in this at all, Nor knew of their intent. Montargis. Sir, 'tis all one; Part or no part, 'tis credited to you, And will be ever. Go not abroad, I pray, Unarm'd or unattended. Be advised; You are not safe. From this time forth you walk With pitfalls in your path. 'Tis you or he Must fall to rise no more. Burgundy. Well, I'll beware. Montargis. One vantage you may suck from what hath chanced. The Monks, thus dying for the word they spake, Will leave an echo in the people. These Will now misdoubt the Duke; and if mischance Should haply overtake him, some will say It was not undeserved. Let care be used To spread the accusation; taking note The Monks, as they were led to death, were gagg'd To stifle it. Bid waverers call to mind The dealings of the Duke in earlier years With Jean de Bar, and that enchanted ring Which still he wears, that gives him absolute sway O'er women, be they ne'er so chaste; which ring He scrupled not most impiously to employ Even in the Holy Week. Noise that abroad; And likewise that he hath a chamber, lock'd, Which none may enter, where the pictures hang By scores, of ladies o'er whose virtue thus He foully triumph'd. Burgundy. Truly, I have heard Of such a chamber. Montargis. More than heard have I, For I have seen it. Burgundy. Hast thou? By St. George Thou hast an entering art; how got'st thou in? Montargis. Sir, by the golden key; there is no lock Which that key fits not. To your Highness too Free entrance shall it open, would you view This zodiac of fallen stars. Burgundy. Some idle hour. But go, Montargis, see if the Monks be safe; And bring me word. I am but ill at ease; 'Twould comfort me to hear their heads were off. Scene VI. This scene and song will not be found in the earlier editions of the play, and the song is mine only by an act of appropriation and the conversion of another's prose into verse of my own. The prose is Lady Minto's, in her Life of Hugh Elliot, p. 202:ââIn looking over such a correspondence as this, the map of a whole life is unrolled before one. The starting point and the goal, the sunshine and the rain-cloud;are seen together: the same glance shows us the cause and consequence of action, the visions of hope and the experiences of reality, the growth and decay of friendships, the rapid succession of gladness and grief: and thus, âlooking before and after,â and pondering what might have been, what has been, and what may be again, the thought rises in one's mind, that if there be in other spheres spectators of these shifting scenes of life, they see few sadder sights on earth than the dawn of human joy.â âGeoffrey de Laval and Eustace d'Estivet. Geoffrey. He bade me tell you he no longer needs That ditty destined for a serenade, Nor other amorous songs, how sweet soe'er, Your art can minister. If sing you must Still of love only, then he'd have you sing, Not of love's dalliance, rather what he deems, Thro' grace bestowed, not less but more divine, Love's dirge. Eustace. My boy, when boyhood's happy years Are past and gone, too aptly wilt thou learn That Love and Death are mates; for either love Dies in the living, or the living dies. Oh boyâ Geoffrey. But I am older than you guess; You think, because my beard a little lags, That I know nought of love. Oh, but I do; And this I know,âif what you say of love Is true, and in the living love can die, Then rather would I that I died outright Than that the love which is my life should die And I should seem to live. Eustace. And may I know For whom it is that thou would'st die? Geoffrey. For whom? Well, there are two; his Highness is the one; The other is a maid, whose name isâno, I must not tell it. Eustace. Not to me? Dear youth; Thou'lt find not one that tenders more thy weal; God grant that if one day I sing a dirge, It may not be for thee. Geoffrey. God grant itâyes, Because my horoscope, his Highness says, Points to one hour with his. Eustace. Nay, is it so? Well, he that sings the dirge of love and joy Needs not to single out this hour or that; Still less that youth or maid. One song I sang, In other years, that touched upon that key, And if I could remember it ... âI askedâ ... Geoffrey. You mustâyou must remember it. You shall. (Eustace sings). I asked a sweet Spirit above That looked on the earth with a sigh, What ails thee, oh Spirit of Love, And whence comes thy sorrow and why? As I looked, said the Spirit, it chanced Two lovers, a maid and a boy, Came before me, enraptured, entranced,â What I saw was the dayspring of joy. But if it was joy you descried, Why was there no joy in your face? 'Twas joy that you saw, and you sighed; Love's feast, and you could not say grace. He answered,âThe near and the far For me come together in sight,â The beauty that shines like a star, The cloud and the blackness of night; Of friendship the Spring and the Fall, Love's glory that Shame overtook,â All visions of Hope, and through all Reality's bitter rebuke. 'Twas a bridal, and anthems were loud That pealed for the maid and the boyâ But her veil was entwined with a shroudâ What so sad as the dayspring of joy? Geoffrey. 'Tis well for them that have the art, like you, To put away their sadness into songs. 'Twas with a tender and a gracious grief The Spirit deigned to look on human woes; But had he not the solace of a sight That reaches farther than an earthly far And sees another dawn? Eustace. Thereânow I own A ripeness must be thine beyond thine years, And truly beyond mine; for I but sing, And thou art fain to preach. Geoffrey. Hark, hark! the chimes. One, two, three, four ... the hour is come, and now,â If Iolande be steadfast, and the King, As hitherto, consenting,âshall be wrought The miracle of the tears. The Duke gave leave, And I can pass you through the chapel doors; But we must go at once and see unseen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. âThe working-room of a Painter. The Bastard of Montargis and the Painter. Montargis. Well, Sir, these foolish women, as I said, Beset me for my pictureâno escape; And if a hundred crowns may answer it, There is the gold; and being thus besieged, I hold my ransom cheap. Painter. The sum, my Lord, Has more relation to your quality Than my deserts. A side-face shall it be? Or noâa full face; for 'tis but in that The story of the face is told at large. The full face portraiture should much divulge, Aud yet much more adumbrate .... Turn to me .... It may be of one look alone delivered, And yet with many pregnant .... All but straightâ Your pardonâsoâA little more this way ... There, there, I have it. For the scar, my Lord, Shall it be painted? Montargis. As you please. Painter. The scar Is portion of the story; it shall stand. So now to work. Montargis. Excuse me; not to-day; My leisure serves not; but some fortnight hence I'll come again. Whose face is that, I pray, That gleams from yonder panel? Painter. That, my Lord? It is her Grace of Burgundy's. Montargis. Trueâtrue; You told me so beforeâstolen as she sat Over the lists at NÃªsle. Painter. Tis but a sketch, Yet of great price to me; for this, wrought out, Builds up the fortune of my piece in hand, SalomÃ© in the hall of Herod. Montargis. Hah! That face befits the argument. The mole Upon the neck,âis that, as some aver, An added charm, or is it not a blemish? Painter. There is a power in beauty which subdues All accidents of Nature to itself. Aurora comes in clouds, and yet the cloud Dims not, but decks her beauty. Furthermore Whate'er shall single out a personal self Takes with a subtler magic. So of shape; Perfect proportion, like unclouded light, Is but a faultless model; small defect Conjoint with excellence, more moves and wins, Making the heavenly human. Montargis. For myself, Unto things heavenly am I devote, And not to moles and weals or humps and bumps. Yet I consent, her Grace of Burgundy Has charms, as you have painted them, that vie With any France can boast. Painter. 'Tis kind, my Lord, In you to say so; but I spared no pains. Look closer; mark the hyacinthine blue Of mazy veins irriguous, swelling here, There branching and so softening out of sight. Nor is it ill conceited. You may mark The timbrel drooping from her hand denotes The dance foregone; a fire is in her eye Which tells of triumph; and voluptuous grace Of motion is exchanged for rapturous rest. Montargis. 'Tis all exceeding good. I take my leave; And, you forbidding not, some fortnight hence I come again. Painter. At your command. Montargis. Good day. [Goes out, but returns. I have bethought me of a friend whose soul Lies in the hollow of her Grace's hand, Soft fluttering like a captured butterfly, To whom this picture were the very leaf That it would feast on. In his amorous eyes This portrait would be worth a thousand crowns. Trust it to me, I prithee, for one day, That I may show it to my friend. Painter. My Lord, So soon as it has stamp'd its effigy Upon that altar-piece I told you of, 'Tis yours to sell; and for a forward step So please you in the mean time, take and show it. Permit me to attend you. By your leave. Scene II. âThe Chapel in the King's Palace. Iolande and Robert the Hermit. Robert (kneeling at the altar). Father, that throned in glory and in light O'erseest all things, and this Earth thy work In its first newness fresh from Thee survey'dst And saw'st that it was good, behold it now Old and adulterate with pain and sin And cursed with strife, whilst anguish and despair Cry piercingly, but not to Thee, for pity,â Behold it now a world of blood and tears: And as by power Thou mad'st it fair at first, So by Thy mercy, so by Thine infinite love, So by Thy heavenly washing, cleanse it now: Almighty Father, spare this realm of France: Father, this region, fairest of the earth Whilst Thou wast with us, wanting Thee is foul; And from its filth and rank corruption teem All loathsome, all unutterable crimes. Oh may the few that serve Thee serve Thee so That many may be saved! Visit this vine Which Thou didst plant and erewhile mad'st so strong; Visit thy royal husbandman King Charles, That, charged to tend it, he have Thee to aid, And fainting not, have power to chase and smite The wild boar breaking in. And if this Maid Be chosen of Thee, a vessel of Thy grace, Shower Thou Thy blessing on her high endeavour. [He rises. Maid, I adjure thee for the last time now If any breath of earthly passion dim Heaven's mirror in thy mind, renounce this rite; For as the blessing were beyond all price If thou and thine attempt indeed were bless'd, So deep were thy damnation if, through sin Of self-deceit, or frailty of the flesh, Or wavering faith, or human loves at war With heavenly, thou mad'st havock of this hope. Iolande. Hermit, I saw her; she was robed in white, With golden hair that glisten'd in the sun, And eyes that look'd in turn from me to Heaven And Heaven to me, compassionate and pure And radiant with celestial love and joy. âI am Saint Mary Magdalene,â she cried; And then, as though she caught the word from Christ,â âForward to Zoar; faint not, look not back; If doubt assail thee, for that o'er thy soul The shadow of a sin hath fleeted, deem That doubt to be but devilish, and know That dear and sacred in the sight of God As innocence itself is blest contrition; Else why was I beloved, and whence this crown?â With that, the glory round her head shone forth With sevenfold lustre, and she vanish'd. Robert. See; The Duke, the King. Enter the King, the Duke of Orleans, The Abbot of the Bernardins, with the phial, and Passac. The King. Brother, I prithee bid the Sacristan Leave jangling of those bells. Orleans. I hear no bells; 'Tis but your fancy, Brother. I have heard The ear hath phantoms, like as hath the eye, And men hear sounds that are not. It is common. The King. True; once I thought my body was a church, My head the belfry; and you'd scarce believe What clangour and what swinging to and fro Went on, and how the belfry rock'd and reel'd, Till Death, the knock-kneed laggard, came to church; Then all was peace. Orleans. No more of that. Look, look,â There by the altar is that spotless maid On whom the sainted Magdalene drops anew Her tears of tenderest love, which, turn'd to balm, With potent touch shall heal and fortify This shaken yet majestic soul of France. Make no delay. The King. Oh Virgin fair and pure! Thou hast a goodly presence, and thy face Is like the face of one who longs for Christ And sees Him coming in the clouds with power; And now thou drawest near, thou'rt not of earth; For there's a glory round thee, and thine eyes Are as that Seraph's which I saw long since When God was good and gracious to my soul And sent me messages of love. Oh maid! I see a Heavenly message in thy face, And know thee more than human. Iolande. Royal Sir, It is a vision you behold, not me; I see it too; whichever way I look Is light and glory; for it fills the place, And angels' eyes meet mine. Robert. Let none gainsay That angels' eyes behold this work. Oh thou Redeem'd from sinful love by love divine, Who, weeping in the darkness nigh the tomb, Wast by the angels bidden not to mourn For Christ was risen, which heard thou went'st thy way With fear and with great joy,âteach us to weep In such wise that great joy may come through tears, Knowing Him risen: thou debtor unto whom Love brought forgiveness and forgiveness love Redounding each to other, ask for us That love and pardon our great debt demands: Thou who with tears didst wash the feet of Christ, Wash them again with tears,âwash them again With tears of intercession for the sins Of God's afflicted servant, Charles of France. The King. I know himâ'tis the Hermitâhe does well To clothe himself in skins. Brother, a word; It is not meet I undergo this rite In Royal robes; I should be humbly clad; I and the Hermit will change clothes. Orleans. Nay, nay, This is no time to linger; kneel as you are. Lord Abbot, place the phial on the altar. Now, sainted Iolande, beloved of God, Perform your hallow'd function. The King (kneeling). Be it so. Iolande. I, as divinely call'd, and by the grace I trust is given me, sign thee with this Cross; And by God's power, and by the Cross of Christ, And by the virtue of these sacred tears Wept by Saint Mary Magdalene, enjoin All evil spirits that inhabit here, If any now inhabit, to depart, And I command that none henceforth shall dare To vex the soul of this anointed King. Robert. Amen! amen! so be it! The King. There they goâ That's Astramon,âthat's Cedon; get ye hence, False traitors! My Lord Abbot, follow, follow; And sprinkle holy water in their track, Or they will turn again. Good Hermit, follow. [Exit followed by Robert the Hermit, the Abbot, and Passac. Iolande. Hear me, Angelic Host! Seraphic Bands, And Spirits that erst imprison'd here on earth Have burst your bonds and mounted, list to me, A child of earth, to whose weak hands were given The spear and shield of Christ,âoh bear me up Now that my task is done,âlift up my heart, For it is trembling, tottering, fainting, sinking, And teach it such a song of joy and praise As, borne aloft toward the mercy-seat, May mix with hallelujahs of your own! And oh that I were worthier, and that now, Upspringing from my consummated task, I might but be released and join your choirs In endless anthems! God of boundless love, Take me, oh take me hence! Re-enter Passac. Passac. My Lord, the King, As hath been sometime heretofore his wont, Hath bid us take away his sword. Orleans. Well, well; No matter; say no more. Passac. He calls for you. Orleans. I come. Oh, Iolande, a hasty vow Was that I vow'd, that when thy work was wrought I never more would ask to see thy face. Once, once again I must. Ere the sun set I bring thee tidings of the King. A cry within. My Lord; Orleans. I come, I come. Iolande. I fear you now no more; Christ hath me by the hand and I am safe. Orleans. Passac, attend her to the Celestines. Who calls so loud? I come, I say, I come. Scene III. This scene has been altered since the first publication of the play; if, as I believe, improved, I am indebted for the improvement to the remarks of an anonymous writer in a literary journal,âmade, I think, with a true critical insight, though, I am sorry to say, not in a friendly spirit.â(Note in the Second Edition.) âThe Secret Cabinet in the Palace of the Duke of Orleans, hung round with Pictures, each concealed by a curtain. The Duke of Burgundy, the Bastard of Montargis, and an Attendant. Montargis (to the Attendant). Withdraw the curtains and retire. Burgundy. Too true; Wild as the winds, they tell me, wild as the winds. He knows not those about him nor himself; Son of Perdition, Scape-goat, Man of Sin, He calls himself, and foams at all who say âYour Grace,â âYour Highness,â or âmy Lord the King.â No madman who believes himself a King Is so enamour'd of his royalties As this poor King envenom'd is against them. To see the Fleur de Lys most angers him, And when he can he tears it. One alone Hath power upon him (whence derived we know), The Milanese enchantress Valentine, My worthy Cousin's wife; who reads such books As when the hangman burns, he puts on gloves For fear of what may happen. In his rage He seized the old Archbishop by the throat, Bidding him cease philandering and fiddling And dig himself a grave beneath the gallows. The Archbishop, in a mortal terror, cried, âOh let me go and I will do it;â then He squatted on the floor, and laugh'd. Montargis. This day, If ever, shall your Highness seize the reins. The people are inflamed; in every street They gather, hurling curses at his head Whose practice once again hath crazed the King. The death, too, they demand, of that young Witch Whose art the Duke hath used. Burgundy. That was decreed Beforehand. Montargis. Sir, a Council should be call'd Ere this cools down. Burgundy. Already it is call'd; It meets at six.âHo! here's a galaxy Of glowing dames! Well done, my amorous Cousin! Whate'er his errors at the Council-board, By Becket's bones I cannot but commend His choice of paramours. Banners are these Ta'en in Love's warfare, and hung up to tell Of many a Noble, many a Knight despoil'd. Ha! were it not a frolic that should shake Grim Saturn's self with laughter, could we bring The husbands hither,âeach to look round and spy The blazon of his dire disgrace. Montargis. 'Twere sport That were I following my father's hearse Would make me roar with merriment. Burgundy. Who's this? Tell me the name and quality of each In order as they come. Montargis. This is Adele, Wife of the Seneschal de Montenay. Beautiful vixen! for three years and more He caged her in his castle on the Yonne, To teach her tameness; and she learnt revenge; Whereof her present love is part and lot. Yond Cupid painted in the vault above Poison'd his arrow when he shot at her. She mimics gracefully a fondling softness, But there's less danger in a bear's embrace Than her caressings. Burgundy. God ha' mercy! Pass; Who is the next? Montargis. Evangeline St. Cler, The lily of Bordeaux, Count Raymond's daughter; An easy, lazy lady, freely fraught By nature with a full complacency And swelling opulence of inward joy Sufficient to itself, that knows no want, Too careless happy to have need of love. And leave her unmolested, she were chaste As Thekla in the cave; but urged and press'd, Resistance is too troublesome; she's kind, And if a lover wring his hands and weep, She can refuse him nothing. Burgundy. Weep for a wench! I'd have the fool well whipp'd. I know the next; She, if I err not, is De Chauny's spouse. Montargis. Pressing a portrait to her pouting lips, Which once were not so pale; and whence the change Ask her successor smiling opposite, The Jew Rispondi's daughter fresh from Rhodes. A polish'd corner of the Temple she, Dove's eyes within her locks; an innocent child, Sold as a toy and senseless as a toy, Who hardly knew what love or sin might mean. Her reign was short. Burgundy. And then the next! Montargis. Which! This? Burgundy. She with the timbrel dangling from her hand. Montargis. I know not this; this was not here before. The one beyond it .... Burgundy. Not so fast; this face I surely must have seen, though not, it may be, For some time past; it hath a princely grace And lavish liberty of eye and limb, With something of a soft seductiveness Which very strangely to my mind recalls The idle days of youth; that face I know, Yet know not whose it is. Montargis. Nor I, my Lord; Albeit the carriage of the neck and head Is such as I have somewhere seen. Burgundy. But where? Familiar seems it, though in foreign garb; And whether it be Memory recalls Or Fancy feigning Memory ... Death of my soul! It is my wife. Montargis. Oh no, my Lord, no, no, It cannot be her Highness. Burgundy. Cannot, cannotâ Why, no, it cannot; for my wife is chaste, And never did a breath of slander dim Her pure and spotless fame; no, no, it cannot; By all the Angels that keep watch above It cannot be my wife ... and yet it is. I tell thee, Bastard of Montargis, this, This picture is the picture of my wife. Montargis. And I, my Lord, make answer it is not. I could as soon believe that Castaly Had issued into Styx. Besides, look here,â There is a mole upon the neck of this, Which is not on your wife's. Burgundy. That mole is hers; That mole convicts her. Montargis. What? a mole? Well,âyes, Now that I think of it, some sort of smirch,â A blot, a blur, I know not what ... Burgundy. That mole. Oh see, Montargis, look at her; she smiles, But not on me,âbut never more on me! Oh would to God that she had died the day That first I saw that smile and trusted her; Though knowing the whole world of women false, Still trusted her,âand knowing that of the false The fairest are the falsest, trusted still, Still trusted herâOh my besotted soul! Trusted her onlyâoh my wife, my wife!â Believing that of all the Devil's brood That twist and spin and spawn upon this earth She was the single Saintâthe one unfallen Of this accursed Creationâoh my wife! Oh the Iscariot kiss of those false lips! With him tooâto be false with himâmy bane, My blight from boyhood. Montargis. Verily therein Was foul-play worse befoul'd ; no arts but his, And theirs who taught him, with their rings and rods, Powders and potions, could have breach'd the wall Of that fair citadel. Burgundy. I'll have his blood. Montargis. My Lord, I do beseech you, be not rash. I own this is not at all points the place Where I could wish to find, hung up to view, A portrait of her Grace of Burgundy: But patience is a virtue which the times Demand of married men; to shout one's shame Were but to add to injury disgrace; Make not an open scandal; keep it close; Nor give to every mocking mountebank A theme for jest. Burgundy. No scandal; there's no need; But ere yon sun shall set, that villain dies. Montargis. 'Tis just he should; and, as the world wags now, There will be twenty triumph in his death For two that seem to mourn. Burgundy. He dies, by God! This hand shall kill him if none other. Montargis. Nay, Such handiwork should not become your Grace. Give me your warrant and the deed is done. Burgundy. Ere the sun sets. Montargis. A later hour were better; We want not daylight for a deed like this. Burgundy. I sleep not till he's dead. Come thou with me, And take thy warrant. Montargis. Sir, at your command. Burgundy. Look here, Montargis: [Drawing his sword. Should a breath be breathed That whispers of my shame, the end is this. [Stabs the portrait in the heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. âA Street. âDe Vezelay meeting his Squire. De Vezelay. What of Montargis? Hast thou found his track? Squire. 'Twas dark ere I had reach'd the spot; but there I spied him; he was muffled in his cloak And skulk'd beneath a porch you'll find half way Betwixt the Celestines and Gate Barbette; It bears for sign the image of our Lady. I left Philippe to watch and came to tell. De Vezelay. Then there shall he be met with. Squire. He is arm'd. De Vezelay. Else could I not assail him. Should I fall, Take thou this token unto her thou knowest, And say I gladly would have lived to serve her, Wherein defeated, I as gladly die: So speak from their graves the Spanish lovers and martyrs of Liberty in Landor's Inscription: âEmeriti . lubenter . quiesceremus . âLibertate . partÃ¢ . Quiescimus . amissÃ¢ . perlubenter.â Which ended, to my mother take this purse; It sums the wealth of Raiz de Vezelay. Scene II. âThe Convent of the Celestines.âThe Duke of Orleans and Iolande. Orleans. You knew not, Iolande, but I knew well, The import of that word which Passac brought,â âHe bade us take away his sword.â Poor soul! So long as sense is with him he takes thought For all, and ever as the clouds within Speak to his spirit of a coming storm, Desires to be disarm'd. Iolande. Alas! Alas! Orleans. Take courage and take comfort; look not back; 'Tis that way darkness lies. God knows thy heart; He knows thou wrought'st devoutly and in faith, And though He grant thee not a Kingdom's health, 'Tis for the Kingdom's sins, and not thine own,â For mine and for the Kingdom's sins,ânone else, That He denies thee; nor for these for long; Thy power, supernal even now in me, Through me shall work its way to purge the realm, And victory and peace shall yet be thine, Though now defeated. Forth then from the Past, And bid it get behind thee. Hope and joy Shall blossom from this ruin. Iolande. With joy and hope Let never more my name be named on earth. Wrought I in faith? But what then are the fruits? I wrought in sin, and shame is my reward. Orleans. Nay, never, never yet have sin or shame Stain'd thy resplendent soul, nor ever shall. One gift hath been refused thee, one reward, But thou art still Heaven's chosen child, and Heaven Is in thine eyes and lips and brow and voice; Nor even in the rapture of that rite Believed in through belief in Heaven's behest, Wert thou so like an Angel sent to save As in thine anguish now. If not the King, Yet surely me hast thou been sent to save, Nor wilt thou cast me,âoh! no, no, not now,â From that pure presence which is safety's self. Oh! say not now our paths must be apart; I could have borne,âI thought I could have borne,â To leave thee and to see thy face no more, Caught in a gust of triumph and of joy That swept thee out of sight; but as thou art Not Earth nor Hell shall part us. Iolande. Earth and Hell! It is for Heaven to part us. Earth and Hell Are closing round and pressing in upon us And shutting out the very sight of Heaven. Oh, leave me; I have told thee I am weak, Weak through the overthrow of faith and hope, Weak through the triumph of malignant Powers, And weak through what beside I will not say. But in the chambers of my soul, one light Still burns, and shows me, wildered though I be, That saving strength is found in self-distrust. If thou wouldst learn of me, learn that. Orleans. Oh God! But canst thou not believe .... I plead not now Nor ever will, though fifty fiends should rise And clutch in fury at their former prey, For aught but what is gracious and divine, Thy gracious guidance, thy divine support To rescue from their rage, not me alone, But many a million more; for France through me Is blasted and accursed, and her through me May'st thou redeem from darkness and from death, And ransom and assoil. 'Tis France that pleads. Iolande. Prince, tempt not me, nor tamper with thyself. Nor thou nor I are Saviours of mankind: They have another. Oh! in Him, not me, Seek grace and strength, and in His armour clad Go forth and conquer. No, not me, not me! For never was it meant when God array'd Thy spirit with a lustre more than man's That it should bend with less than manhood's might And seek support in me. Orleans. Oh, Iolande, Thy mandate if the demon dared dispute, That dare not I. The very ground thou tread'st Is holy; it is dedicated earth Which never more shall foot of mine profane. But wheresoe'er it journeys, ever there The vision of thy presence floating round Shall every path and every precinct guard, And he that was the slave of sense and sin Shall be thy soldier in the cause of Christ, Far from thee and yet near. Enter Flos de Flavy. Flos. Where is she? Iolande, oh fly! Begone! Take instant flight; a message has been brought From Raiz de Vezelay in fearful haste; The people clamour and the Council sits To judge thee; and no safety but in flight. Iolande. Great God! one Angel watcheth o'er me still, Sent by Thy pardoning love,âthe Angel Death. Orleans. The Council sits to judge her! Who hath dared Without my summons to convene it? Flos. Sir, The people rage and say they will have blood. His Grace of Burgundy in Council sits, And, to appease them, he hath pledged his faith That judgment should be pass'd. Orleans. His Grace is mad; Or else 'tis in the dark he strikes, nor knows Why nor at whom. Fear not for Iolande; I'll to the Council instantly, and all Will then be right. My cousin and myself Are now in amity, and were we not, We ever have been, as we ever shall, Frank friends or open foes. All will be right. I'll tell them it is I shall answer this; For 'twas of my devising. Iolande. Oh! no, no; You shall not go; all was well done by you; The guilt was only mine. Orleans. Sweet Iolande, Your arms about me thus would once have strain'd The staunchest of my purposesâbut now ... [Breaks away. Robert the Hermit enters. Robert. Is this a time for clippings and embracings? Kneeling in prayer were meeter; know'st thou not What threatens thee, and hear'st thou not thy knell? Orleans. I know what threatens those that threaten her. [Exit. Flos. It is the people that I fear the most; They are as cruel as that dangerous Duke, And madder than their King. Robert. Unhappy maid, Haste thee to Sanctuary; a dreadful fate Awaits thee else. Iolande. Hermit, it is but death. Let me stay here. What death am I to die? Is it by fire? God grant it be by fire! For holiest men aforetime have so died. Oh Hermit! am I utterly unworthy To die like them? Robert. Maiden, the hand of God Hath written up thy sin. Thy fatal touch Polluted and depraved the inherent grace Of those most holy tears. Iolande. Oh 'tis most true; My guilt is great; the visions of the sense Beguiled my wandering soul, and I misdeem'd Fallen nature's ecstacies for grace divine. Robert. Look further for thy fault. How and whence came That treachery of the sense? the love of God Enamours not the sense, nor, being pure, Conspires with that, like losels o'er their cups, To inebriate the soul and so betray; For love of God the Father, God the Son, And God the Holy Ghost, comes not with heat, With seizure, transport, and with ravishment; Since these are wild and fugitive as the lights That dance and flicker o'er a new-fill'd grave, And where these are, there are the fumes of death And savour of corruptionâamorous love Tainting the love of Christ. I saw even now Him that went hence reluctantly let go. Search thou thy heart; avoid the wrath of God; And that thou may'st avoid it, take thou heed, Nor brave in wantonness the wrath of man. It were presumptuous sin to court that death Which God in His great mercy and good time Grants or withholds. Flos. Yes, Iolande, oh yes; 'Tis tempting Providence to linger. Come. Iolande. Take me to Sanctuary. I will wait God's time. Scene III. âA Street. In front is the porch of a house, surmounted by an image of the Virgin. The Bastard of Montargis and Raoul de Rouvroy. De Rouvroy. This north wind bites. I am half sick with cold. Montargis. The night is chill; but something in my soul Dances and sparkles like yon frosty star. To watch for her I love or him I loathe Is better than a bed of down. De Rouvroy. God's life! I shall be frozen to the door-post soon; My dagger hand is numb. Montargis. Think of thy wrongs; Hast thou no spark of Hell-fire in thy heart To keep thee warm? De Rouvroy. This hanging by and waiting Is what I hate. Come but the work to hand, It warms me well. Hear'st thou? what noise is that? Montargis. 'Tis but a sheaf of snow slid from a roof. 'Tis vain to hearken for a tread to-night; Unless he come accompanied and talk, You'll see him ere you hear him. De Rouvroy. Hark! the chimes! Eight and three quarters. Montargis. Look, he comes! hide, hide. [They retire under the porch. Enter the Duke of Orleans and Geoffrey de Laval, his Page. Orleans. Now haste thee home, and bid the Seneschal Bring me swift muster of the men-at-arms Wherever I may be. Montargis. (springing from the porch, followed by De Rouvroy and others). That is in Hell. [Stabs him. Orleans. Ha! know ye whom ye strike? Villains, 'tis I, The Duke of Orleans. Montargis. The man we want. Orleans. I know thee not, nor whence thy grudge to me; But thou hast struck the life. [Falls. Montargis. And will again. [Aiming again at the Duke, whose Page, throwing himself on his master, is stabbed and dies. Montargis. Fool, what thy master needed not is thine. He hath enough. De Rouvroy. What! is he dead? Make sure. Montargis. Look in the gutter; full of blood he was; But if that drain him not ... Fly for your lives! There's some one comes. [Exeunt Montargis and his gang. Enter De Vezelay and his Squire. De Vezelay. What horrible sight is this! The Duke! the Duke! Orleans. (raising himself.) And who art thou? Is't not De Vezelay? Not many minutes have I left of life, De Vezelayâ [Seeing the body of his Page. Alas! poor faithful boy! And couldst not thou be spared! De Vezelay, Lift me and take me to the Celestines Alive or dead. Despatch thee. If God will I fain would reach the Celestines alive. [Faints. De Vezelay. (assisted by his Squire, takes up the Duke). Accursed be my feet that came too late, My hand, that could not find a time to strike Ere this was acted. Bastard! man of blood! 'Tis thou, 'tis thou that didst this murder. So! Swiftly, but smoothly, to the Celestines. Scene IV. âThe Council Chamber. The Dukes of Burgundy, Bourbon, and Berri, the titular King of Sicily, and divers high Functionaries and Officers of State. Burgundy. I will be sworn, my Lords, the Duke my Cousin Can clear himself of this. The people fume, And rub again old rancours, and in chief That satyr's dance, when, as by miracle, Of five that from his Brother's torch took fire, Masking in garbs of tow, and burn'd to death, The King alone escaped, thanks be to God! They murmur, too, of Passac's rescue, wrought, As they misdeem, in malice to the King; Whence they, by evil inference, charge the Duke That he design'd the present woe. For me, I hold him innocent, though much misled. Bourbon. Good Nephew, for the witchcraft let the witch Be answerable singly; mix not up His name with hers. Berri. When she hath smelt the fire, Doubt not the people shall be pacified. Burgundy. Clerk, is the warrant ready? Clerk. Here, so please you. [As he signs the warrant, enters Montargis, who whispers in his ear. Burgundy. And next, my Lords, the testy time consider'd, Behoves us to take order with all speed Touching the Regency. My Cousin's claim Stands first. I marvel that he is not here; I scarce can think the city so incensed But he might find his way in safety hither. Yet, though he slights us, let it not be said His absence slurr'd his rights. The vulgar voice Is loud against him; but what skills it? Noise Shall never fright prescription from its course, Nor shall a puff of popular discontent Move ordinance aside. [Shouting is heard in the streets. Berri. What cries be these? Burgundy Know'st thou, Montargis? Montargis. Sir, the citizens Demand the death of that young Sorceress Who practised on the King. Burgundy. There is her doom. [Gives him the warrant. See thou the citizens be satisfied; Their urgency is just. [Exit Montargis. Bourbon. But hark again! I seem to hear an uproar here within, A hideous shrieking. Enter the King's Chamberlain. Chamberlain. Oh, my Lords! my Lords! A treasonâsuch a treasonâsuch a deedâ A deed so barbarous, all the world's despite Can never match it, hath been doneâOh God! So black a treason ... Burgundy. What, upon the King! Chamberlain. Not on the King, my Lord,âthe Duke âthe Dukeâ His Grace of Orleans. Burgundy. God in heaven forefend! What hath befallen him? Chamberlain. Dead, dead, my Lord: Most foully murder'd. Burgundy. My sweet Cousin dead! Chamberlain. Stabb'd in the street as he was hastening hither: Scantily attended and unarm'd. Berri. Stabb'd dead! Sicily. Merciful Heaven! Whose monstrous deed is this? Bourbon. Oh God, Thy hand is heavy on this realm! When will the measure of Thy wrath be full, And horrible portents cease? Sicily. Who did it? Who? Who did this murder? Burgundy. Ay, Sir, speak; who did it? Chamberlain. I know not who, but they are more than one, And running different ways. Berri. Send for the Provost! Set double guards upon the city gates, And let none pass. Chamberlain. The Provost is astir And the whole city in the streets. The gates Are closely guarded, and 'twas seen by some Whither the murderers fled. With these for guides The Provost tracks them. Bourbon. Nephew, are you ill? Burgundy. Ill? No! who says I'm ill? Bourbon. You're deadly pale. Burgundy. Who can abide so terrible a blow And keep the crimson in his cheeks? Who's safe, If thus the very gutters of our streets Run with the blood of Princes? Who's secure? Which of us next? Send for the Provost. Berri. Nay, It were but hindering him to call him hither; He's hot upon the quest. Burgundy. Then God forbid That we should hinder him. Berri. Why lo! he's here. Enter the Provost of Paris. Sicily. Speak; hast thou found them? Hast thou found the fiends That did this execrable deed? Provost. My Lords, Some of their number tried the Gate Barbette, But found it shut? Berri. And whither fled they then? Provost. I think, my Lords, I know; and might I search Whose house I will, high, low, or rich or poor, Or though the noblest in the city, then I'll stake my head these traitors shall be caught. Bourbon. Search where thou wilt; in Paris none, thou know'st, May dare to shut his door against the Provost, Save only Princes of the Blood. Provost. My Lords, The powers I crave are such as bear no note Of reservation. Bourbon. Take them to the full. What say ye, my good Brothers and my Cousin? Sicily. All privilege push'd by, break every bar That stays thee. Berri. Even as we would ourselves; Hut, hovel, royal palace, all alike, Enter and search. Burgundy. Nay, hold ye there. For me, I'll have no nuzzling catchpole cross my door, As though misdoubting that a royal roof Should harbour cut-throats. Bourbon Cousin! Provost. In your hands, My Lords, I place my office. 'Tis for you To do your pleasure. Berri. Nephew, should thy door Be solely barr'd, when all stand open else, There were a second slaughter done this day, And thy good name the victim. Sicily. By God's death, I would myself impeach thee. And behold! I see thy plain impeachment in thy face; And if thy Cousin's ghost should rise before thee And say thou didst it, I were not more sure Of thy most damnable guilt; and with my sword I'll probe and search and prove it. Burgundy. Spare thy threats, Good Uncle. It was I that did this deed. Bourbon. Too well I knew it from the first. Sicily. And I. Berri. And dar'st thou say thou didst it, thou that satt'st Pledging him at my board but yesternight, And with him at Christ's table didst partake A pledge more sacred still? Dar'st say 'twas thou! Sicily. Oh shame to knighthood and our Royal House! Pluck from thy miscreant crest the Fleur de Lys And stick the deadly hellebore in its place; For from this hour attainted is thy blood, And from the Royal Tree of France thy branch Is lopp'd and on a dunghill cast to rot With all that's base and abject. Hence! begone! Get hence, or I will spurn thee with my foot And push thee out of door. Burgundy. Beware, good Sirs, The day we meet again. [Exit. Sicily. Pursue him, Provost, Arrest him. Berri. Be not hasty. First take note Which way the people tend. Bourbon. Tis well advised; Let's muster each of us our several guards And draw them to a head; the people else May turn upon us. Sicily. Then why sit we here? Up and be doing! for each minute lost May give him wings to fly. Get we to horse. Scene V. âThe Convent of the Celestines.âIolande kneeling beside the body of the Duke of Orleans. In front Raiz de Vezelay and Flos de Flavy. Flos. She hears us not. Vex not her ears with words; They do no good. De Vezelay. But if she linger here Her death is sure. Flos. Thou know'st her not; I do; She will not fly. De Vezelay. Alas, then she is lost! Flos. Her soul is hardly with her. 'Tis with his. Since she took water and with her kerchief wash'd The blood-stains from his face, she hath not stirr'd. How grand he looks! Death's grandeur and his own. Iolande. Not coldânot yet. De Vezelay. Did she not speak? Flos. To us? No, not to us. Iolande. (springs to her feet). Great God! Look there, look there! The blood is gushing freely from the wound. De Vezelay. Then is the murderer near. Enter the Bastard of Montargis. Montargis. (affecting to start back). Oh piteous sight! Oh woeful spectacle! What, lies he there,â He that was yesterday so bold and gay! At this even they that loved him not would weep, And how should I forbear? Iolande. Assassin, hence! Profane not thou the presence of this corse, Lest it arise and slay thee. Felon, hence! Montargis. What! charge you me with this unhappy deed? And call you me a murderer? Flos. Yea, she doth. Montargis. Ha! doth she truly? she is ill advised. Her pardon should I weigh but at its worth The charge of one, who, if I read aright The warrant in my hand, herself is charged With deeds more terrible than she lays on me; Foul witchcraft link'd with treason; for which crimes I come, as by this warrant is commanded, To take her to her doom. Flos. Fell miscreant, hold; Approach her not. Montargis. Stand from me, or by Heaven I'll shake thee from my path. De Vezelay. False child of Hell, Home to thy dam! [Stabs him, and he falls. Montargis. Perfidious Raiz, why this? I never did thee wrong. De Vezelay. For all mankind, Whom thou hast wrong'd in putting on the mask Of manhood who wast born and bred a fiend, I take this vengeance. Enter the Provost of Paris followed by Officers of Justice. Provost. What new gap for life Is open'd here? More blood? Without, within, In streets and houses, ay in churches too, Rage violence and slaughter, and this night The very skies rain blood. [Turning to the body of the Duke of Orleans. Unhappy Prince! I honour'd thee in life, and do I now Forget to do thee reverence!âHa! by Heaven, Unless mine eyes play false, this writhing wretch Is he whose malice slew thee, and my zeal, Though hasting, is belated. Say, whose hand Was his that balk'd the headsman of his due And laid this traitor low? De Vezelay. That hand was mine. Provost. I blame thee not, but would not he should die Till he be question'd at the ChÃ¢telet; The rack shall bring some hidden truths to light Which else were buried with him. Montargis. I appeal From them that sent thee to my Sovereign Lord, His Grace of Burgundy. Provost. Appeal to him! His Grace hath fled the city. Montargis. Fled! Soâ Wellâ Take thou my body; for the breath that's in't, Beware that it take wing not by the way, For now it flutters even as for a flight More distant than the Duke's. Provost. (to the Officers). Sirs, take him hence. Montargis. One moment, Sirs, I pray you. Ere I go, Fain with this lady would I make my peace. My purpose was that she should share my flight, And of this warrant I possess'd myself To save her, not to harm. This to attest Behold what's here,âthe hand and seal of Death. Iolande. Make thou thy peace with God, and not with me; For in God's court and presence we shall stand, Both thou and I, this night. Provost. Sirs, we lose time; I say, convey him hence. [Exeunt the Provost and his Officers, with Montargis. Clamour and tumult is heard without, and enter Robert the Hermit. Robert. Oh haste thee, haste! A rolling mass of fury comes this way; Fly by the wicket: Raiz de Vezelay, Attend her, I beseech thee; I, the while, Will from the window speak to them, and strive To stem the torrent. Iolande. Hermit, it is I Must speak, and vindicate the fame of him Whose lips are silent. [She advances to the window, is struck by an arrow shot from the crowd, and falls. At the same time the doors are forced and the crowd appears, but pauses at the sight of the Duke's body and of Iolande fallen. Hermit, I am slain; And that is well. Christ will receive my soul, Knowing that though I fondly loved another, I strove to love but Him. That other too Christ will receive; for if he sorely sinn'd, Deep was his penitence and large his love. I seem to see the Citizens at the door, But now mine eyes wax dim,âor else my mind,â And all things swim and glimmer. Cease, dear Flos, Thou vainly striv'st to staunch it; let it flow. I see more clearly now. Ye that love truth, And of these fearful miserable days Would justly judge, accuse not in blind wrath Him that lies there, whose true and generous soul Was faithful to the King. 'Twas mine, 'Twas mine, The fault was mine, that though I work'd in faith And sought the King's deliverance, all was vain Being I was not worthy. Lo! I die, And bless the hand from which this arrow flew, And ask forgiveness, first of God, and next Of you, the People. Free among the dead. [Dies. Robert. Back, Citizens; that which ye sought ye have; Though now methinks ye would ye had it not; And some are weeping. Hie ye to your homes. [The people retire. He turns to Flos and De Vezelay. Arise, if horror have not stark'd your limbs, And bear we to the Chapel reverently These poor remains. In her a fire is quench'd That burn'd too bright, with either ardour fed, Divine and human. In the grave with him I bury hope; for France from this time forth Is but a battle-field, where crime with crime, Vengeance with vengeance grapples; till one sword Shall smite the neck whence grow the hundred heads, And one dread mace, weighted with force and fraud, Shall stun this nation to a dismal peace.</field>
