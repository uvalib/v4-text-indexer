      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. You skilfull heads, that sit in place to see, likewise to heare, What openly by Actours deeds in place shall straight appeare: Beefore your vigill wakefull eyes therfore perpend it well. For the acts in order follow, which the preface may not tell. But thus I shew, most strange it is, and pittifull beside, Mixt both wt mirth, &amp; pleasant showes: wherfore we pray you bide The last as well as first to see, then vprightly iudge and way Our Authors minde and doyng his, in that which wee display. Let iudgement then from you proceede discreetly to be showne, And let not rashnes ouersoone to mutch abroade be blowne. For thus wee do perswade our selues, if simple Authors skill Should Seneca exceede in verse, or Ouids pleasant quill: Or could tell more then Tullies wit, eke Homer put a side, Yet do wee deeme some Momus would him skorne, mocke, &amp; deride. But as he doth deepe low descend from these right famous wights: So doth he stand in redines to bare those Momus spights. Yet staies him on this steadfast hope, the wise his simple paine Will well except, and that is all that hee dooth seeke to gaine. Let this for preface you suffice, the actours redy stand, Your patience ernestly wee craue to proceede out of hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here entreth Galiarbus, with Sedmond, and Lady Clarisia. GaliarbÂ«us.Â» My children both, whose aged Syer from natiue soyll must pas, To lead his life in forraine Lands, for in vaine tis alas To craue of king Arbaccus hee, in Arabia to remaine, Wheras your aged mother shee her corpes in earth hath laine. Sutch was the spight of Parasites, so is dame fortune straunge That I from out Arabia must in other cuntreis range. And this the last day is you see, that I may here remaine With you my children both alas, which causeth mee complaine With trebell care and penssiuenes, ha all my only ioy, The sight of you doth cause me now to waile with great annoy. And therfore my sonne Sedmond now on this my blessinge here, I charge thee to remaine for aye true to thy sister dere. Be thou a stay, to her decay, a rocke and fortresse strong, And do not see, her ennimy, to profer her sutch wronge. Bee thou her shield, in towne and field, her fence and onely stay, Let not her foe, procure her woe, I hartely thee pray. Be thou her freend, vnto the end, her faithfull brother true, And graunt that shee, remaine with thee, lest doubtfull cares ensue. Thus I thy sier, of thee require, as duty doth thee binde, Let nature rule thee, to cherish her truly, and be to her most kinde. Â«SedÂ»mond. Right louinge sier, whose charge well waid &amp; lodged in my brest, Whose minde as it did neuer swarue but yelded to your heste, I am your Sedmond till I die, I am and will remaine My sisters true and faithful freend though I the death sustaine. The charge that you haue geuen mee shalbe performed sure, The wight that doth my sister wrong his death will I procure. And therfore, my sweete louing sier, for vs take you no care, The gods we trust shall vs defend, and rid from out their Snare. But ha my father graunt that I thy Icarus may bee To wend and dwell in woods and Caues to liue and die with thee. Â«ClaÂ»risia. And graunt Galiarbus my sweet sire, that I with thee may goe, And not for to remaine behind to waill with cares and woe. Â«GaÂ»liarbus. Ha no my children, do refraine seeme not to craue of mee, Do not betake your selues like case for banisht wights to bee. Though Minos hee that cruell kinge did banish Dedalus, And though your father is like case by this kinge Arbaccus: Yet mought his Icarus remaine in Creta quietly Where hee did passe his daies before hee practized to fly. Wherfore my children, cease your talke, do not your father greeue, And seeme no more in any wise such question foorth to meeue. And now fare well, your aged sier no longer may remaine, For that he is cast into excile from you his children twaine. Â«ClÂ»arisia. O father, sith you will depart from hence your selfe alone, Graunt that I may demaund of you but onely question one. Â«GÂ»aliarbus. Craue what thou wilt Clarisia, I graunt what so it bee. Â«ClÂ»arisia. Then where yu mindst for to remaine good father shew to mee. Â«GaÂ»liarbus. Where to remaine Clarisia, of truth I know not I. Â«ClÂ»arisia. Then do thy children thee commend vnto the heauens hie. Desieringe them most entirely to shield thee from all woe, And bee to thee assistance good where thou doest ride or goe. Exit. GalaribÂ«us.Â» Ha farwel farwel my childr? twain your sier must needs depart Both spÂ«eak.Â» Farewell O father to thee againe the cause of this our smart. SedmonÂ«d.Â» Clarisia, sith fortune hath to vs sutch lot assind, In this our prime of yeres to part from parents both so kinde, The one being bereft of life, as was the gods decree, The other cast into excile, a banisht knight to bee, We must contente our selues with all, refraining wonted care, In hope the gods for vs in time a salue will soone prepare. Wherfore sister Clarisia, let vs againe retire Unto our fathers mansion plase I hartely you desire. Where wee will liue in quiet rest. clarisia. Ha cruell words to soone exprest. Ha brother Sedmond, how can you liue in quiet rest one day, And seinge thus our father deere banisht from vs away. Leaue of this fond request of thine, let pity pearce thy hart, Sith nature can thee not constraine to waile thy fathers smart. What ioy should I obtaine, alas, if I a princes were, To see my father rainge abroad in cuntreies strange for feare? Ha brother Sedmond leaue of this talke and blot it out of minde And be not found to father thine obliuious and vnkinde, But be thou still right sorowful, and pensiue for his sake. Sedmond. Why sister, what thought do you mean yt you would haue me take The griefe that I should take for him I see it were in vayne, And not of force him to restore to natiue soyll againe. And therfore my sweet sister dear refraine once more from talke, And come let vs retire with speed, Let vs straight home go walke, And let vs waile no more I pray. within Condic. Stay. Sedmond. Stay? wherfore should I stay? Condici?s. Lest thou woorke thy owne decay. Sedmond. Decay? how can I do fo? Condici?s. Through force of thy fo. Sedmond. Of fo? come sister content yee. Condici?s. Nay, stay lest thou repent thee. Sedmond. Why should I repent mee? I haue not offended. Condici?s. If that thou retourne, thy death is pretended. Â«SÂ»edmond. Pretended? ha gods, what haue I done that I should die therfore? Come forth I stay what so thou be, and do reply no more. If thou be an Ecco or Ghost in like case, Come foorth with speed draw nere into place. Conditi?s. I am neither Ghost, Spirit, Ecco, nor crier, And neither fish nor flesh, but halfe a true knaue, halfe a lier. Â«SÂ»edmond. What tauntyng wight art thou that doest in Eccos sort reply? By like thou art some Parasite come our talke for to descry. Â«CÂ»ondic. Parasite? nay if there bee no remedy but needs enter I must, I will to it with a good heart and lay all fear in the dust. Here entreth Conditions. Clarisia. What Master Conditions, what newes at court this day? Â«CÂ»ondici?s. Ha sutch newes that I am afraid will turne to your decay. Â«SÂ»edmond. What is that good Conditions I pray thee expresse. Condici?s. Ha, I haue wept so that for faintnes the truth I cannot confesse. Clarisia. Good Conditions leaue of thy wayling and shew the matter. Condici?s. Ha, a vengance of all villaines that would seeme for to clatter. Ha, that same king Arbaccus by parasits is so allured, That your deathes all ready hee hath procured. If that you seeme to retire backe againe, The king hath layd waite that you both mought be taine, And so convaied to some prison away, Where he doth intend to woorke your decay. Auoid all sutch dangers if you will be ruled by mee, Seeme not to retire againe, but in continent fly. And so shall you be sure your liues for to saue Though they amongst them your goods chance to haue. And I will fly with you as a seruant to bee, If with a good will you willingly entertaine mee. Sedmond. Yes with a good will, Conditions, with all our hart, And therfore straitwaies let vs hence depart. Clarisia. Ha cruell kinge Arbaccus thou, ha tiger fierce vntame, That first our fathers banishment procuredst for to frame. And that thou art not pleased with all but seekest our decay. Woe worth the time I first was borne, to see this dismall day. Euen as the wolfe, or tyger fierce doth seeke the lambe to kill: So seekest thou both day and night our innocent blood to spill. Ha thou that banished hast our sire for no offence at all, But through thy flattering parasites hast wrought his end and fal. A double woe remaine to thee, ha cruell kinge vnkinde, Graunt Priams state to be his state that such daies hee may finde. And fare well now Arabia soile, fare well our natiue land, Farewell all pompe and pleasure eke, for wee haue taine in hand To fly from you, wee forced are for sauegard of our liues, To raing in c?treies straing abroad wher fortune foorth vs driues. SedmonÂ«d.Â» Clarisia leaue of your plaints an ruthfull griefes of minde, And come let vs go rainge a broad our father for to finde, That we may haue his company in this our banishment. Clarisia. Proceede you when you please, to follow you I am content, And come Conditions wend with vs thy company let vs haue. Exeunt. Condici?Â«s.Â» Keepe on your way maddam, you neede it not to craue. Ha ha Conditions, ? you, there are two sorts of c?ditions as I ges. For there are good and eeuell conditions the truth to confesse. And to which of these twaine thinke you disposed am I? If I should say to good conditions you would reply. On the contrary side, if I should say to euell I did cleaue, Then euery Iack would thrust me out of dores streight by ye sleeue. And therfore for my owne aduantage beleeue me you may, As nere as I can ile vse a mediocritie by the way. And Mediocritie is my name though condicions they mee call, Nere kinde to dame fortune to raise and to let fall. As for experience, it was my chance to blesse one the other day, And within two dayes after hee was hanged out of the way. But to show you the chiefe cause now wherfore and why This knight with his famelly are faine for to fly, I wil. There are certeine parasites haunting the court night &amp; day With whom this knight Galiarbus could neuer away. Hee these parasites persued through his outward apperance, Which caused them to hate him and theron wrought his greeuance For why they accused him of treason to Arbaccus the kinge, Reporting him to bee one that sought the realmes vndoinge. The which he neuer went about, but toke still great paine In kinge Arbaccus behalfe the realme to maintaine. But I am the arrants villaine that you shall finde or see, For the banishment of Galiarbus was all longe of mee. For secretly I set mee aparasite him to accuse, That hee the common wealth sought to abuse. Now had I tould the king before, how, and in what sort The accusacion being red, that he would report. Then stept I to Galiarbus, and rounded him in the eare, Saying if he would put ye matter into my hands he nede not feare. Now he being contented, I went to the kinge by and by, And bid him aske if hee were so content, and hee answered I. Thinking the king asked him if hee would that I in place Should answere against his accusers in his case. But I had toulde the king sutch a tale in his behalfe before, That in faith hee neede not many accusers more. And so vpon his one answere he was condemned to dy. Then I like a crafty knaue, stept forth by and by, Desiering the kinge not to put him to death out of hand: But for so small offence to banish him the land. The knight hering mee to spake so in his cause, Tooke mee for his speciall freend without farther pause. And theron the kinge appointed him a day by and by To depart the land, but taken after that day, he should dy. Now the kinge on the other side, perseuinge my crafty fetch, If hee could haue taken me I know that I should stretch. And so in faith there is no more cumming to the court for mee, But how say you, haue not I deuisd well to haue company? For the kinge thought as mutch of these as of his death I am sure, But onely to haue their company this he I did procure. Tush, this is but a pece of my conditions by the way. But by your leaue I will vse Amedyocritie whosoeuer saies nay. Well, there is no remedy, I must after th? their company to haue For I am sure that is all that they seeme for to craue. Exit. Here enter. 3. Tinkers, Shifte, Drifte, and Vnthrifte, Singinge. The tinkers songe. Hay tisty tosty tinkers good fellowes they bee, In stopping of one hole they vse to make three. Come merely foorth mates, and let the worlde wagge, Though our trade do decay our mirth shall augment. This tinkerly trade wee geue it the bagge, Like beggers wee liue and want to pay rent. Yet wee neuer lin trudging from citie to towne, Our hammers on the kettels bottomes do ringe: Yet we scarse get lether piltches with out cloke or gown, Fie on this trade that no more gaine will bringe. Hay tisty tosty Tinkers good fellowes they bee. In stopping of one hole they vse to make three. Shift he with shifting hath almost mard all, He can not be trusted in no kinde of place: For many olde things into his budgit doth fall, That oft time he feareth to show forth his face. Pots, Saucers, Candilsticks, and Scummers beside, Are trust vp and closely layd into the packe: Away hee hies quickly and dares not abide, Shifts bandogge doth beare his tooles on his backe. Hay tisty tosty, Tinkers good fellowes we bee, wee stop one &amp; make two, wee stop two and make three. Nay yet rather Drift is worthy of blame, That is oft times driuen to a weake stay. To rob, kill, and spoile, he taketh no shame, Driuen for to get it, and to haue no nay And vnthrift againe consumes it as flat Weemen, dise and drinke, lets him nothing keepe: And therfore all wee three haue met together pat, To venture a robbing, to play now bo peepe. Hay tisty tosty, Tinkers good fellowes they bee, They stop one hole, make two and stop two &amp; make thre. Shift. Hey liuely, by gogs bloud wee tinkers are at a mad stay, For wh? we are in ye city, there is nothing but tinkel tinke al ye day Drift. And by gogs bloud Shift, I can not go but my basson must tang: And by your leaue if I had not deuisd this drift, I mought go hang. Â«VÂ»nthrift. And by his wo?ds my Masters I am in ye same state you twain be But wh? folke bring their kettels to m?d for one hole I make three But my masters wot you what? I heard newes about ye court this day That there is a gentleman with a Lady gone away, And haue with them a litle parasite, full of mony and quoine. By gogs bloud let vs leaue of tinking and follow them to purloine. For the littell knaue hath got it with cogging, and telling of tales. And therfore by my consent with his quoine we wil fill our males. Â«ShÂ»ift. Felow Vnthrift by gogs bloud here is my hand on yt condicion, Wee wil take away their purses and say we do it by commission. But by his wounds, although I haue no commission to showe I intend not to let them part with their purses I trowe. Â«DÂ»rift. A commishioner gogs bloud who made a commishoner of you? If yu haue no better answer at the bar yu wilt hange I tel thee trew. Â«ShÂ»ift. Hang you tinkerly slaue? Shift wil scape wh? Drift shalbe h?ged Â«VÂ»nthrift. Tush my masters you are bothe as good as euer twanged, Â«DÂ»rift. I pray thee, good Vnthrift stand back, &amp; let me try with yt slaue. Â«ShÂ»ift. If thou darest Ile lay my hammer on your pate you knaue. Â«VÂ»nthrift. My Masters leaue of your brawling thus one with an other. Â«DÂ»rift. By gogs bloud I cannot hold my hands &amp; if hee were my brother. You howresun Banbery slaue, come againe and thou dare. Â«ShÂ»ift. By his wo?ds, to hurle my kettel at thy hed I take no great care Â«DÂ»rift. And if thou hurle thine, thinke not but againe Both skillet, basson, and hamer shall at thy hed amaine. And therfore by gogs bloud hurle and thou dare. Â«SÂ»hift. If thou do begin, then hange mee and I spare, Â«VÂ»nthrift. Well then my masters to it with a good will, and neuer care. Â«ThÂ»ey fight. And I will play on my kettell as though I were a drumslare. Stay, stay, no more brawling now one with another. Â«SÂ»hift. By gogs bloud Drift, Ile breake your noddell if you were my brother. And thou be a honest fellow Thrift let vs but try Â«DÂ»rift. Come and thou dare, for I pas not a turd for thee I. Â«VÂ»nthrift. Leaue of this brawling my masters, and heare what I shall say. The Gentelman with his lady intend to come this way, And therfore let vs be all in one minde, and agre all together, For I know it will not be long or they come hether. And therfore let vs be packing hence, and in a bush ly, Untill they be already to pas a long hereby. And when they thinke themselues in the wood most surest to bee: Their purses wee will bee so bolde as share betwixt vs three. How say you my masters how like you this deuise? Shift. By gogs bloud fellow thrift thou art excellent wise. Well fellow drift because of our busines I thee forgiue, And Ile make thee amends and we both skape the gallous &amp; liue. Drift. Shift this is your knauery if you breake ones hed with a pan, You will giue him a plaister to hele it againe if you can. Well here is my hand, I forgiue thee with all my hart, Shift. Well come on then, in continent let vs from hence depart. Exeunt omnes. Here enter, Sedmond with Clarisia and Condicions out of the wood. SedmonÂ«d.Â» The silly traueiler that is atachd through weried toyle, And forst through meare necessity to trace from natiue soyle, Though weried at his iournies end with painfull traueill past: Is glad in hart he hath attaind his iournies end at last. So we beinge possest as now with weried toile like case, Must liue in hope all traueill past to finde a resting place. Wherfore good sister be of chere cast care from out your minde, And liue in hope all sorowes past our father out to finde. You see the chirpping birds beginnes you mellody to make, But you vngrateful vnto them their pleasant voice forsake. You see the Nightingall also, with sweete and pleasant lay, Sound forth her voice in cherping wise, to banish care away. You see dame Tellus shee, with mantell fresh and greene, For to display euery where most cumly to be seene. You see dame Flora shee, with flowers fresh and gaye Both here and there and euery where her banners to display, Wherfore good sister cast of care, abiect this griefe of minde, In hope the gods for this our sore a salue no doubt will finde. Clarisia. Brother Sedmond, the traueiler deserueth place of rest, In that hee taken hath sutch paines as you before exprest. But brother wee are no traueillers that vseth day by day, To rainge abroad to foraine Lands to trace the beaten way. Wee are constraind through very force to fly from natiue soyle, Wee are compeld through cruelty to vnder take this toile. The traueiller may keepe the way that likes him best to go. Wee are constraind to shrowd our selues in woods for feare of fo. Then brother tell me whether he or we do take most paine, Considering when he please he may returne to home againe? You say the Nightingall also with sweete and pleasant lay, Doth sound her notes in chirpinge wise to banish care away. What pleasure may wee take in her or in queene Flora shee? What pleasure in dame Tellus eke thinke you for vs to bee? No no good brother Sedmond, their pleasant noyse they make, Would rather cause me as I am all pleasure to forsake. What pleasure should we take brother, if all the birds in field Were present here at instance now their harmony to yeeld? Their pleas?t voice renewes my care, their swete melodious so?d Doth cause me now with trickling teares in sorrowes to abound. For thinking on the pleasures now that earst in time we had: Doth cause me now to pine for wo wher hart would haue me glad And therfore brother leaue of talke, in vaine you seeme to prate, Not all the talke you vtter can my sorrowes can abate. From sutch vaine allegations, good brother seeme to stay. Condi. Nay noble gentelman vnder your correction if I may, I haue a woord or two with your sister by the way. How say you Lady Clarisia, are you like case contented? Clarisia. Condicions if thou speake thy minde it shall not bee repented. Condi. Then in your quarrell against your brother I minde to breake So that with licence gentleman you wil giue me leaue to speake. Sedmond. With a good will Conditions, speake forth what is thy minde. Conditi?s. Then in faith Ile pay some home anon in their right kinde. It is geuen to weemen to be obscure &amp; ful of simpriety by the way Proffer them the thing they most desier they wold it denay. They are so full of sleights and fetches that scarce the Fox hee, In euery poinct with wÃ©emen may scarce compared bee, For when men pray they will denay, or when men most desire: Then marke me a woman she is sonest stirred vnto ire. Their heds are fantasticall and full of variety strange, Like to the Moone whose operation it is often times to change. And by your leaue howsoeuer it goes the mastery they must haue, In euery respect or in ought that they seeme for to craue. But Madam, I hope you will inpute no blame vnto mee, Considering you are a mayden, and full of imbycillity. Clarisia. A well Master Conditions, is this my part you take so? CondicÂ«ions.Â» Mistresse Clarisia, to my poore the truth I must show. SedmoÂ«nd.Â» Of truth Conditions the truth thou hast tolde CondicÂ«ions.Â» Nay and shall please you I am some what feminatiue, For if there be any thing in minde out I must it driue. Shift. Down with them all for surely they shall die, Clarisia. Ah cruell chance, good brother fly. Drift. Why where is the other that was in their company? By gogs bloud minks hee shal bie his flying full deare. Thrift. And in faith you wiseld faced knaue, ere you part from hence, Ile be so bolde as diue in your pocket to share out your pence. ConditÂ«ions.Â» Nay gentelmen Tinkers, be good vnto vs twaine. Shift. Make an end, take away all they haue I say once againe. Clarisia. Ah cruell luckles chaunce alas, ah fortune thou vnsure, That canst in turning of thy wheele still cause vs to endure Sutch changed heaps of woes (alas) as tongue cannot expresse: For why I see in vayne it is as now to seeke redresse. Wherfore you cruell Tyrants three, dispatche my life in haste, For why I Ioy no longer life sutch heapes of greif I taste. Drifte. Tush dispatch, and when you haue done, binde her fast to this tree. Least when yt we are gone she make an vprore, and we persued bee Shift. Come on Lady, fast to this tree, we intend you to binde. And with your owne handcarcher your eies wee will blinde. Thrifte. So in faith minks you are fast now for skaping away, Clarisia. A wo be to the time when first I saw this luckles day. Thrifte. Why what shall we do with him by gogs bloud I can not deuise Except we should set him to kepe crowes, &amp; picke out both his eies. ConditÂ«ions.Â» Ah of all loues haue compassion on mee and serue me not so. Here ye? and you can not tell what to do with mee, then let mee go. The diuell a peny haue I, and you will hang me on this tree. Shifte. Gogs bloud and well sayd, for he hath red his owne destinie. ConditÂ«ions.Â» Ha, will you let me go? in good faith thanke you I do, Drifte. Nay, stay a while, we tell thee not so, For thou art like now to hang on this tree. Â«CÂ»ondici?s Ha and there be no remedy but hanged I must bee One of you hange before to show how well it will become mee. Â«TÂ»hrifte. To hang thee or sutch as thou art, we thinke it but a sport. Â«CÂ»onditi?s Cast not away a proper young man in sutch a kinde of sort. Â«ShÂ»ifte. Tush dispatch and hange him straight out of the way. Â«CÂ»ondici?s Ha good gentelman Tinker, I beseech you now stay, What meane you by his wounds I haue beraied my self out of cry Â«DÂ»rift. Whether thou hast or hast not thou shalt surely dy. Â«CÂ»ondici?s Ha and there be no remedy but that needs hang I must, Giue me the halter Ile to it my selfe and lay all care in the dust. Â«TÂ»hrifte. I am sure thou meanest not to hange without helpe of a freend? Â«CÂ»?ditions Ist not as good to hang my selfe as another hale the end? Â«SÂ»hift. By gogs bloud my Masters and hee will we are all content, For then in time for hanging him we neede not repent. Well Drift giue the halter vnto the elfe. Â«CÂ»onditi?s Ha was there euer littell knaue driuen to hang himselfe? Nay I must also request your ayd to helpe me into the tree. Â«DÂ»rifte. Nay if thou lacke any helpe, then hange vs all three. So law now dispatch, and with speede make an ende, Â«CÂ»onditi?s What to do? Drift, Mary to hang thy self Â«CÂ»onditi?s. Nay by your leaue that is more then I do intend. Â«TÂ»hrift. Why I am sure thou intendest not to serue vs in such sort? Â«CÂ»onditi?s Were not hee mad would hang himself to show three tinkers sport? Â«DÂ»rift. Why I am sure to ferue vs so, thou dost not intend? Â«CÂ»ondit. A mad foole hee were would desperatly dy and neuer did offend, Â«DÂ»rifte. By gogs bloud Ile teare him downe or els Ile leese my life. Â«CÂ»ondit. Backe againe or ile be so bould as pare your nails wt my knife. Â«TÂ»hrifte. Nay looke my masters the slaue lookes like an owle in a tree, Â«SÂ»hifte. Nay hee lookes like a crafty knaue beleeue mee. Â«DÂ»rift. By gogs bloud Shift he lookes like a madge howlet as yu hast said By the mas if I had my bow and boult here hee should be payd. Â«CÂ»ondi. Halo, halo halo, howe. holoweth in the tree. Â«TÂ»hrift. Why, what doost thou meane to hollow in the tree? Â«CÂ»ondi. What do I meane mary to haue more company come to mee. Â«SÂ»hifte. By gogs bloud my masters we were not best l?ger here to stay Â«AÂ»mbo. I thinke was neuer sutch a crafty knaue before this day. Exeunt. CondicÂ«ions.Â» Are they all gone? ha ha ha, welfare olde shift at a neede, By his woundes had I not deuised this I had hanged indeede. Tinkers (quoth you) tinke mee no tinks Ile meddel wt th? no more I thinke was neuer knaue so vsed by a companie of tinkers before By your leaue Ile be so bould as to looke about me and spy, Least any knaues for my cumming downe in ambush do ly. By your licence I minde not to preache longer in this tree. My tinkerly slaues are packed hence as far as I may see. Ha, my good mistres Clarisia, I am sory to se you at this stay, I will vnbinde you that we may in all the haste trudge away. And Lady it is not best for vs in Arabia longer to tary, Seeing that fortune in euery respect against vs still doth varie. For seeing wee are so ny the sea that wee may pas in one day Cleane ouer the sea to Phrygia, I would not wish wee stay Whereas now your good father sir Galiarbus is, And of your brother I warrant you wee there shall not misse. ClarisiÂ«a.Â» Wel, sith needs wee must, I am content to fortunes beck to bow Who showes her self an enemie to me poore wretche as now. Wherefore a dew Arabia soyle, farwell my brother deare, It boutles is, I see, as now in woods to seeke thee heare. Condic. Well Lady, without any farther talke let vs away. Clarisia. Proceede Condicions, I minde not here in danger longe to stay. Exeunt. Here entreth Sedmond waylyng. Sedmond. The wyght that had a Iuell fayre and by misfortune strainge, Through negligence hath lost the same, as he abrode did rainge, The iewell beyng none of his, but ones that was his freend, Who did the same beetake to him from losses to defend: Now being lost, through negligence of him that kept the same, What double greif thinke you doth he within his brest stil frame? My sister shee the iewell is, whom father gaue to mee For to preserue from cruell foe, within my garde to bee. But I (alas) through negligence haue lost my sister deere Through cruell tyrants furious force within this forest heere, But ha my sister, is this thy chance that fortune hath assinde? Must thou alas to rapin yeeld? must thou now rest behinde? Ha, why did I beetake to flight the corpes that liues in thrall? Why did I not with thee like case into their clutches fall? Would gods Lucina she with sharpe and crooked crabbed knife, When first I cam into this world had end my vitall life. But sith it was not destinie, nor yet the gods decree: With this most wretched state (alas) I must contented bee. But farewell now my Courssers braue, atrapped to the ground, Farewell adew all pleasure eke, with cumly Hauke and Hound. Farewell ye Nobels all, farewell eche Marsiall knight, Farewell ye famous Ladies all, in whom I did delight. A dew my natiue soyle, a dew Arbaccus kynge, A dew eche wight, and Marsiall knight, a dew eche liuyng thynge. A dew my wofull Sier, and Sister in like case, Whom neuer I shall see agayne, eche other to embrace: For now I will betake my selfe a wandryng knight to bee. Into some straunge &amp; forrayne land their cumly guise to see. Exit Here entreth Galiarbus out of Phrygia. Galiarbus. Who can but smyle and laugh to see the state of Fortune shee? Who can deuise in rightist wise, to yeelde dew praise to thee? Ha Goddisse yu whose countnance straunge doth eb &amp; flow eche day, Sometimes thou doest restore to wealth, and sometime to decay. As proofe is playnly seene by mee, though banisht wight I was, Thou hast restorde to wealth agayne, far better in eche case. Though kynge Arbaccus hee, withall his courtly trayne, And eke his route of Parasites, did holde mee in disdayne: Yet through thy turnyng wheel, and variable chaynge, Hast mee restord to wealth agayne in forayne countreis straynge. How should I duly lawd your names O heauenly powers for this? How should wee giue you half the prayse that you deserue Iwis? Sith that our mortall tongue vnable is to showe The prayses that you ought to haue, which for our part wee owe, Galiarbus shall not cease whilst life hee doth enioye: In rightist wise he can deuise your prayses to imploye. For why, though I but knight in Arabia did remayne: It was my chaunce and fortune good here in Phrygia for to gayne A Lordship great, the which the Duke hath now bestowd on mee, Upon condicion to remayn his subiect true to bee. The which if I Galiarbus be euer falsely found. Ye heauenly powres do all agree my life to confound. But am constraind in spight of force my wonted name to hide, Least by that king Arbaccus spyes my state should be espide. But ha Galiarbus, in this thy ioye what sorrowes doth abound? What suddaine griefes atache thy minde? what care thy hart doth wound? What good can all this liuing do to thee in forrain land, And seing children twaine remaine as yet in tirants hand? And in vaine tis to send for them, for why, that cruell kinge For mine offence, I this am sure, in prison will them fling. Well, of force I must content my selfe, and liue in care and woe, From children twaine I must refraine, and for aie them forgoe. Here enter Lamphedon out of Phrygia. LamphÂ«e.Â» As one that saw an aple faire in top of tree so hye, And durst not once presume to come, nor draw the same anye, For that he knew not what he was that owd the peece of ground Wherin the Aple on top of tree, in beauty did abound. Which was a cause of his distres and double griefe of minde, For that the keepers of the same did show themselues vnkinde. This Aple is a lady faire whome I espied this day, As I in Forest hunting was persuing of the pray. Whose bewty hath bewitched me, euen mawger Dians chase To yeeld and be a courtier now vnto dame Venus grace. Ha Lamphedon, where is become thy stout couragious minde? Shall sight of Lady cause thee now to lead a life so blinde? Shalt thou which art sonne to the Duke of Phrygia noble soyle, Refraine thy woonted pleasures past, and vndertake this toyle? Not all the Phrygian ladies here could cause thee for to rue, Ha wretch, and hath a foraine dame compeld thee then to sue? And must I yeeld in spight of force vnto Cupido hee? And must I leaue my marsiall feats to craue her knight to bee, Whom neuer yet I saw before? ha cruell wretch vnkinde To shoote that dart to pearce my hart, why shouldst thy self so blind I am to craue her loue (alas) whom neuer yet I sawe To show like loue to mee againe, but did herselfe withdraw. And this the first time is (alas) of her I had a sight, Whose cumly lokes &amp; bewty braue hath wrought to me this spight Ha lady braue, would gods thou knewest the loue I beare to thee. Would gods ye wretch would cause thee beare again like loue to me Why Lamphedon, yu knowest not what she is perch?ce a princesse born Ha cruel words, I th? am sure shee will holde me in skorne How dare I then attempt the thing? how dare I then be bolde? How dare I once presume to her my sorrowes to vnfolde? Would god when first I tooke my way the pleasant chase to vew: I had bin slaine through cruell paine, then should not this insewe. Would gods these eies of mine, which giues my body light, When first they vewed thy comely grace they had bin pluckte out quite, For if Apelles hee were present here in place, Unpossible it were aright to picture forth thy grace. But sith that Cupid will not force her for to yeeld mee loue: Would gods by other practices her answeres I might proue. Or by some secret way and hidden strange deuice. Here enter conditions standing priuely. Â«CoÂ»ndi. To meddle with witchcrafte I count you not wise. Â«LaÂ»mphe. What wight art thou that answerest me in such a kinde of sort Â«CoÂ»ndit. It is hard winning of the city without skaling the fort. Â«LaÂ»mphe. Skalinge the forte? I go not about the citie to win. Â«CoÂ»ndi. Yeea but as far as I can see, Cupid hath hit the pin. Â«LaÂ»mphe. What wight art thou that in such sort dost seeme for to reply? Â«CoÂ»ndi. Hee that is by Cupid possest of force must sorrow try. Â«LaÂ»mphe. I here a voice correcting, yet no liuing wight I see, Â«CoÂ»ndi. Hee that trusts to a broken bough, may hap to fall from the tree. Â«LaÂ»mphe. Ha wretch what so thou bee, I would I had thee here, Â«CoÂ»ndi. In vaine tis when the dogs are wery to wish after the deare. Â«LaÂ»mphe. Nay sure, wretche, if I had thee heare thou forsyst me to do it, Â«CoÂ»ndi. Nay with a good will I beseeke you spare not go to it, But if I should stur euer a foote from this place, Hee might soone spy me, and then after me would he apace. There is no remedy but to him I must and banysh feare away, For in vaine it is from hence to depart or the foole to play. Ha noble Gentleman god saue your life for euer to remaine. Â«LaÂ»mphe. Welcome my freend didst thou reply when I did late complain Â«CoÂ»ndi. No gentleman I am no such felow as you take me for I, He deserues death that any gentlemans talke would so descry. LampÂ«he.Â» Of truth if that I had him here his death he sure should gaine. Condi. And worthy for deridinge suche a gentleman to be slaine. If he knew that I had answered him contrary to euery word Hee would go nere to thrust me through ye buttoks with his sword. But let Conditions alone howsoeuer this geare falles out, Hee will vse a pollecy to bring this matter well about. Now this geare cottons law, now shall you plainly see, Which waies so euer the winde blowes it is for my commoditie. Ha noble gentleman, I am sory to se you at this stay, That at the first sight of a Lady you should thus pine away. LamphÂ«e.Â» Why good fellow how knowest thou my griefe, to mee expres? Condi. Hee that hath felte loues bitter stormes must needes the truth confesse LamphÂ«e.Â» And hast thou bin a louer? I pray thee now declare. Condi. Who I? that haue I bin in loue with my owne mothers mare But what say you to him that would help you vnto that dame? Who causeth you this ruthfully these sorrowes for to frame. LamphÂ«e.Â» What say I (quoth you) mary I say he is worthy to haue. The thinge that with toung is vnpossible to craue. But my friend I pray thee expresse and shew to me thy name. Condi. Master Affection, noble gentleman, euen the very same, LamphÂ«e.Â» Master Affection, ha ye gods, now se I if it you please, It lieth in your hands my forrowes for to ease. Condi. Gentleman whatsoeuer lyes in my hand is to your ease. Commaund me euen what you list and Ile do what I please. LamphÂ«e.Â» What sayst thou? Condi. I say commaund me what you lyst, and Ile do what you please. Lamphe. I commaund thee to do nothing, but to aide me here in, That I the Ladies loue through thy help may but win. Which if thou canst do through pollecy and skill. Demaund what thou wilt thou shalt haue it at thy will. Condi. If I can do it quoth you? what kinde of question is that? Nay put away if, for I can do it, this is plaine and flat. And therfore noble Lamphedon you shall wend with mee. Where secretly you shall stand her person for to see. Then shall you heare by her communication there, What good will affection can cause her for to beare. Wherfore noble knight, come let vs away. Â«LaÂ»mphe. Proceede affection, on thy way, for I minde not to stay. Â«CÂ»ondi. You are the better man, therefore you shall first proceede. Â«LaÂ»mphe. Tush, tush affection, all this courtesie doth not neede. Exit. Â«CÂ»ondi. Ha ha ha, this geare fauls out excellent well in deede. Welfare a craftie knaue at a time of neede. Affection quoth you, why? what a counterfeit knaue am I, Thus vnder the title of affection, my condicions to apply? As though it lay in me to cause sutche for to loue? No no thereis a nother that this practise did proue. For Clarisia seeyng this Lamphedon a huntyng in the chase, Was nigh constrained through Cupids force to sue to him for grace Now I commyng this wayes the game for to see, Chaunced to heare him for hir sake in wofull state to bee. I will bring them together sure how so euer it fauls out, For at length it will redowne to my profit I do not doubt. Roome for a turne coate, that will turne as the wynde, Whom when a man thinkes surest he knowes not where to finde. Exit Here entreth Clarisia alone. Â«CÂ»larisia. The lewred hauke whose rowling eyes are fixt on Partredge fast And liues in hope her flight once tayne to win her pray at last: So I through sight of valiant knight within this Forest here, Haue fixt my eye, vntill I die, vppon Lamphedon deere. Ha valiant knight, whose comly corps hath won my hart for euer, Whose sight hath prest my tender brest, that I shal fayl thee neuer. What double greifs feele I for thee? what woes do I sustaine? What heapes of care in tender brest for thy sweet sake doth rayne? Ha Lamphedon, do pitie here thy captiue in this case. And graunt that she obtayne of thee thy fauour and thy grace. Let not blinde Cupid wrongfully on me his cunnyng showe, Let not my loue forsaken be which I to thee do owe. Let not thy mynde cleane contrary be setled on another. Ha Cupid blinded God of loue, take not the tone for tother, Sith that thou forcedst me to loue, ha mightie gods graunt mee, That I may once obtayne his loue, my linked spouse to bee, But ha Clarisia, thy talke is vayne, he is a duke his sunne, And thou but daughter to a knight, of meaner state art come. He forceth not thy loue, he wayes not thy good will, Wherfore refrayne with cruell payne, and liue as louer still. Here entreth Lamphedon sodenly. LamphÂ«e.Â» What needeth further trial then, when Iudge hath heard ye tale? what needs there further plee in case, when agreements doth assaile what needs the Turtell wish her mate, &amp; she in place doth stande? what need haue knights for Lady sights, to raynge in foraine land? what neede I for to sue to thee thy loue for to obtayne, O Lady deare, and seeyng that for me thou doest complayne? Lamphedon doth professe he will to thee bee faithfull knight, Not once for to forsake thy loue, for wronge ne yet for right. And therfore Lady yeelde to mee like promise here agayne, To rest to me as I to thee, a louer true certayne. wherfore O lady answer mee to this my question straight. Clarisia. The silly fish that once is tayne, must yeeld vnto the bayght. wherfore sir Knight right welcome sure vnto Clarisia shee, who almost felt of Plutos paynes, and all for loue of thee. If all the Troian knights were here, or Grecian in like case, whose valiant courage did surpas eche wight in euery place: Clarisia doth protest, as she is Lady true, To rest thy loue while life indure hap so what shall ensue. And therfore my sweet louyng knight, haue no mistrust in mee, For I do whole betake my selfe vnto the vse of thee. So that thou wilt performe the bondes of wedlocke in this case, I am content that none but thou my corps shall sure imbrace. wherfore sir Knight reply agayne, are you herein content? LamphÂ«e.Â» Else all the powers that sits in throne do end with cruell dent My youthfull dayes, and after that with Pluto let me rayne, where as the greesly Hags do rest with trebell care and payne. And therfore Lady, here is my hande, eke faith and trouth I giue, To rest and be thy louing knight, whilst I haue day to liue. In signe wherof take here this gim, and weare it for my sake. Clarisia. Upon condicion noble knight, the same of thee I take. But yet receiue of Lady thine a pledge for pledge agayne, In token that for aye I rest thy loue without disdayne. The whiche Bracelet is made of golde, receaue that with good wil And all that doth belong to me, shall rest as thine owne still. Wherfore syr knight receiue thesame of me thy lady deare, Â«LÂ»amphe. I shall O Lady for your sake euen place it present here. And till I die I surely will weare it for loue of thine, Â«CÂ»la. And this shall rest in keping mine till dayes my life define. Â«LÂ»am. Well Lady then, my wife you are before the gods you see, Â«ClÂ»a. I am and will remaine my deare a true Penelopee. Though I for thy sweete sake my knight a thousand woes should proue: I would remaine as true to thee as shee did to her loue. Â«LÂ»am. And Lady, as true will I still rest to thee, As Leander did that swome ouer the sea. Wherfore O Lady wend with me vnto my fathers place, Where wee will soone there marryed be if that the powres graunt grace. Wherfore my deare Clarisia, let vs no longer stay, Â«CÂ»la. To follow you whereso it bee, Clarisia shall obay. Therfore proceed when you thinke best, Â«LÂ»am. To wayght vpon Clarisia Lamphedon aye is prest. Exeunt Here enter Conditions sodeinly. Â«CÂ»on. God giue you Ioy I hartely pray, and send you both good lucke, And if I might you should be sure to haue hornes like a Bucke. Â«CÂ»la. Why how now Conditions, wher hast thou bin all this while? Â«CÂ»on. Ha I chanst to fall a slepe as I was lifting my legge ouer a stile Â«ClÂ»a. And was that the matter thou staiedst so longe behinde? Â«CÂ»on. In faith I haue slept so long that both mine eies are almost blind Â«LÂ»am. What Master affection, of troth you are welcome, how fare you now? Â«CÂ»on. Euen in good health noble gentleman, how do you? Â«CÂ»la. Affection, ye are misformed Conditions is his name. Â«CÂ»on. By ye mas except I answere wisely it will tend to my shame. Â«LÂ»am. I am sure his name is affection, let him deny it if he will, Â«CÂ»on. Unto any of those two names I must needs answere still. For Affection my sure name is, this is plaine, But Conditions my kirsun name is, to either of these twaine Answere I will though it turne to my griefe, Beleeue me gentleman, if I lie hange me like a theife. Â«CÂ»la. Nay wee beleeue thee Conditions without farther talke. Â«CÂ»on. Well then, will it please you on your iourney for to walke. Â«CÂ»la. Why Conditions, what Iourney thinke you, haue we to goe? Â«CÂ»on. Nay let those that are louers iudge that, I say no mo. Lam. I perceiue he will proue a foxe if you talke with him long, cla. Who takes him for any other, should proffer him much wrong. con. Nay Mistres Clarisia if time conuenient would serue, I could proue that wemen comonly that name doth most deserue. But if you please to depart, I redy am to waight. Lam. Come Lady, for we intend from hence to wend straight. Â«Cla.Â» Proceed my deare for Clarisia is prest to fulfill Your minde in euery respect according to your will. Wherfore Conditions come and waite still on vs. Exit con. Nay if I be behinde then hang me as hy as the house. Ha are they gone? was euer knaue beset in daine so before? Affection quoth you? well fare at a pinche euermore. For if I had not roundly answered to my counterfeit name, It would surely haue redownd to my vtter shame. But howsoeuer the world goes parasites part I must play, For to get my lyuing I can finde no other kinde of way. Well I must after to the Dukes place, euen as fast as I may, But in the end marke how the crafty knaues part I will play. Here enter Sabia alone. Sabia. Like as the Rat that once hath tast of Rosalgar or bayne, Runnes presently to some moist place to coole her poisned pain: So I being possest (alas) through Cupids dierfull dent, Doth liue in pyning state for aye, that life is well ny spent, Ha sweet Nomides who causer art of this my griefe and wo. For Cupid he hath forced me all pleasures to for go, In that vnegally at mee his poisoned shaft hath raught, To cause me set my loue on him who wil set me at naught. But for his sake I fade as doth the flower in sommers day, I pine as doth the Merline shee that could not win her pray. I greeue I waile my lucklesse lot, I am in wofull state, I finde no way that may impaire, or this my sorrowes bate. I curse may sure the time that I did vewe thy comly face, I know right well in vaine it is to sewe to thee for grace. I perce the heauens with my dole, and lamentable cry, I craue of blinde Cupido hee, my sute not to deny. Why was it not my chance alas a princes for to bee? Why was my fortune to be borne of base and low degree? Why was it ah my destiny to be a Phisicions childe? Why was it not my fortune ha, to come of stocke so milde. Whereby I mought enioy thy loue ha worthy knight most stowt, Whose comlines doth far surpas the knights of Phrygia rowt. Which causeth me through feruencie to craue of thee thy loue, Though womanhoode denayes the same, and doth me sore disproue Well, here enters hee him selfe alone, now helpe ye gods of might And graunt that I obtaine my seute which I deserud by right, But first I will go shroud my selfe in corner secretly, To heare if that for any one hee will seeme to reply. Here enter Sir Nomides. Â«NÂ»omides. Though raging stormes of winters force hath done their worst to spoyle Though Boreas wt his boisterous blasts doth range in euery soyle, Though clotted hard Accarnous frost doth freese on dale and hill: Yet can the warmed sootherne winde their raging forces kill. Though fortune shee did frowne on me, &amp; wrought for me such fate Yet at the last all stormes once past shee smiles on myne estate. Though banisht I from cuntrey soyle and natiue kinsfolke deare, Yet hath the powres assind to mee a knightly liuinge heare. Wheras I leade my life at rest, where I minde to remaine, Untill the sisters cut the thred of vitall life in twaine. As for my vsuall name is tornd, and for euer will forsak, And terme my self sir Nomides, a knight of lowe estate. Wherby I quietly may rest, and liue at ease for aye. But contrary if knowen I were, it would tourne to my decay. But for to thinke of father mine, it greeues my carefull brest, That hee should rainge in cuntreis strange, &amp; I should liue at rest. And eke farewell my sister deare, whom I haue left behinde, In cruell tyrants murdering hand, thy life end for to finde. I can not chewse but must acurse the time I fled away, And left thee so behinde to rest vnto thy foes a pray. I can not but must neds confesse I woorthy am of shame, In leauing thee a pray to those that sone thy death did frame. A cruell brother, mought thou say I did remaine to thee, That like a dastard fled away when I thy gard should bee. Well in vaine it is for to repine, sith that the powers are bent To woorke their fury on them twaine, I must be well content. Â«SÂ»abia. Well met Sir knight thus solitary in fields your selfe alone. Nomid. I am pensiue Lady but yet welcome to me as any one. Sabia. Not to sir knight, I thinke you beare to Ladies no such loue, Nomid. My Lady how know you that, you did me neuer proue. Sabia. She yt should proue I thinke should finde in you sum suttel gyle Nomid. You weemen sure are ful of yt though oftentimes you smile Sabia. We wem?? nay, in men you would say for wem? mean to true Nomid. Say you so Lady? for experience then mark what woords ensue. Sabia. Speake forth your minde I am content if so you will not faine Nomid. If so I do Lady, I doubt not, but you will reply againe. Sabia. And reason good if wrongfully you wemen would disproue, Nomid. Not wrongfully but rightfully I shall expres your loue. And therfor Lady heare my talke that I in breef shall speake, And after if you please, againe reply your minde to breake. First what loue I pray you bare Helena vnto her lorde and kinge? What constancy in Creseda did rest in euery thinge? What loue, I pray you, beare Phedria vnto her Theseus, When in his absence she desiered his sonne Hippollitus? What true loue eke bare Medea vnto Duke Iason hee? Tush Lady in vaine it is to talke, they all deceitfull bee, And therfore lady you must yeeld to me in that respecte. Men still are iust though wemen must their plighted vows neclect Sabia. Must? why belike you thinke it comes to them by course of kinde Nomid. Not I my selfe do say the same, but in auctors I it finde. Sabia. In Auctors then you haue an aid for to dispute with mee? But for all your aid in way of iest againe I will reply, If so you will atentiue bee to that I here shall speake. Nomid. With willing hart I do agree that you your minde shal breake. Sabia. Then sir knight how faithfull was Eneas to Didoes grace? To whom he plighted faith by vowe none other to imbrace. How faithfull was Duke Iason hee whom Medea did ayd? When hee to win the goulden fleece by Otes was dismaid? And Theseus I pray you also how faithfull did hee bide When that the vow he once had made to Ariadne he denide. How faythfull was Deomedes one of the Greekishe crew Though Troilus therin was iust yet was hee found vntrewe. And so betweene those twaine, and fortunes luckles hap, Shee was like Lazer faine to sit and beg with dish and clap. Tush tush you see to trust to men whose fickle braines are so, That at the first sight of euery wight their plighted vowes for go. And therfore you must wey in minde, though wemen sometime misse Men wil do so though to their wo it doth ensew I wisse. Â«NÂ»omides. In deede lady I must confesse that you the truth haue sayd. Â«SÂ»abia. Then say that you were conquered in talking with a mayd Â«NÂ»omides. Nay lady he that talkes with you vntill the field he gaine, Should proue the labour he should take both frustrate, fond &amp; vain For why? though men can win in field both honour praise, &amp; fame Yee wem? by your suttel slights full soone their deaths can frame. And therfore lady I must graunt you are to stronge for mee, And if I were a iudge certeine ye wemen should Lawyers bee. Â«SÂ»abia. Wemen? why th? what would you haue poore witles m? to say Â«NÂ»omides. To stand and heare, and iudge aright vpon the wemens play. Â«SaÂ»bia. Wel then shal you be a iudge to that which I in place shal speak Â«NÂ»omides. Wel th? proceede &amp; let mee heare what words you mean to break Â«SaÂ»bia. There was a ship that chanst to sayle a thwart the raginge sea, And being in the middest therof at anker and at ease: In sodden there arose a storme and silly barke so tost, In such a raging kinde of sort, that Ankers all were lost. Now Ankers being gone, and Cabels in like case: The silly Barke by tumbling waues was tost from place to place. The Mariners did quake for feare to see that luckles day, That to the gods with humble sute they all began to pray. The gods then hearing of their plaint and lamentable cry: Did driue them straight by force of winde vnto an hauen by. Wheras they hope for aye to rest if powers do graunt them grace Lo now sir knight iudge you aright on this my wished case. Â«NÂ»omides. Na Lady if you put so hard demaunds vnto your iudge at furst: Hee must haue time to pause theron lest he should iudge at worst. Then would you put some blame in him and say he did you wrong Therfore he giues the iudgment to your selfe that are so stronge. Good Lady let me here thesame, I hartely require. Â«SaÂ»bia. In hope to haue my wished will you shall haue your desire. The ship which I spake of before is I my selfe sir knight: And being once inflamed alas, by Cupids raging flight. Was tost on waues of wrackfull wo, and all for thy sweete loue, I forced was with humble sute to craue of gods aboue To send to me some pleasant time that I with you mought talke, Where now it was my chance sir knight to finde you in this walke I forced am of feruency to craue of you your loue And eke to set all shame aside your good will for to proue. Graunt me therfore, O worthy knight that none but onely I, Shall thee posses, for louing fere, vntill we both shall dye. Refuse me not that am thy friend who loues thee as her life, And graunt that none but Sabia shalbe thy only wife. Lo this is all O worthy knight, that I of thee require, Forsake not thy deare ladies sute, but graunt to her desire. NomidÂ«es.Â» Madame the hart that once is fixt or set and hath yt likes him best What needs it for to seeke for more to breede his more vnrest? My hart is fixt vpon the thinge that I all redy haue, And therfore Lady in vaine it is of mee such loue to craue. I am none such that liues by loue, I serue not Venus traine, I force not of blinde Cupid hee, I hould him in disdaine. Though Poets terme him a god and say he shootes from skie, The which by good experience I straight shall here deny. Lust fauoring folly fond, did falsly forge and faine Loue for a god, because he mought his freedome more attaine, And therfore leaue of sute, and craue no loue of mee, Whiles I haue life this is certaine I will no louer bee, And therfore lady now adue. Exit. Sabia. A wo be to the time that first I did begin to sewe, Now fare well all my hope of him whom I thought to enioy, Whose sight it was that forced me to waile with great anoy, Ah cruell gods of loue, O crafty cancred wight, That wrekes thy fury vpon mee, and touchest not that knight. Ah sir Nomides whiles I do liue in ioy, None other shall attaine my loue though it breede mine anoy. And still will I incroche on thee, thy onely loue to haue, Though for thy sake I should betake my self to wofull graue. Exit. Here entreth Conditions. Condi. Ah ah ah this geare cottens I may say to you. I haue wrought a fetch to set th? by ye eares hap what shal ensue By my honesty it doth me good that I so crafty should bee For the Dutches is fallen out with clarisia long of mee. For I told certein of her waiting maides how ye people in ech place Giues clarisia the prayse and sayes shee excels the Dutches grace. Which when she heard so chafed that it was straung to beholde, On the other side Lamphedon would not haue his lady controwlde. Thus haue I set them together by the eares hap what hap shall, And marke the end of this geare which way it shall fall. For Clarisia hauing to vnkle Mountaynio kinge of Thrace, Will no longer here abide but straight waies thither will trace. And now at the sea coast haue I bin shipping to prouide, For my Master Lamphedon and clarisia against the next tide. I must away rome for a cutter that is euery ynche a man, A villain that will set a thousand by the eares if hee can. Here entreth Lamphedon and clarisia. Â«LÂ»amphe. Clarisia and my deare wife before the gods by vow, With listinge eare do marke in briefe what I shall say to you, Though mother mine the Dutches shee such rigor seemes to show, And all for the good will which I to you do bear and owe: Let not the same dismay your minde cast pensiuenes aside, For till that life be tayne from mee my truth shall sure be tride. And therfore Lady seeme not to depart, I thinke it best. Â«ClÂ»a. A my Lamphedon deare leaue of, and graunt thy loues request Seeme not to stay with lady thine in Phrygia to her wo, But come and wend we presently, to Thracia let vs go. For my vncle Mountanio kinge of Thrace, hath sent for mee, And in his letter hee hath sent, my louing knight, for thee. Desiryng vs to come to him, and that in continent, For why hee hath no childe aliue, wee know not his intent, Perchance, my deare, hee will bestow on vs some goods or welth, Wheras we may more quiet liue in perfecte Ioy and health. And so our absence may in time obtaine your mothers loue, Wheras our presence being heare to anger doth her moue. Wherfore my loue deny me not, but let vs hence depart. Â«LÂ»amphe. A cruell mother to thy childe cheefe cause of this his smart. Must I from lyked soyle depart on seas in ship to sayll Where oft?times through force of waues ye carued pl?cks do faill. Must Lady mine tast the like wronge? a cruell parents sure. That to your only sunne you could, sutch heapes of care procure. Here entreth condicions suddenly. Condi. Gods ames, are you here I haue bin seekyng you all aboute, To certifie you of newes whiche are so true out of doubt. The duke your father hath made great searche for you twayne, And doth intend to imprison you bothe, this is playne. And all vpon the request of the Dutches if you do not flie I am afrayde you and your Lady are like for to die. And therfore of all loues come come let vs away. LamphÂ«e.Â» condicions, come hether man, and a whyle do thou stay, I pray thee tell mee, is it true that thou dost now say? Condit. What a mad man are you? take mee with a lye, And whip mee that all villaynes may take example thereby. LamphÂ«e.Â» Ah cruell parents to your childe, and would you seeke his death? And can your harts agree in one, to stop his vitall breath? Ah Heauens, shall man in crueltie passe the Lyon feerce in feild. Which can compell eache liuing beast vnto his strength to yeelde? Yet the Lyon doubts to slay his whelp, or do it any wronge. The Serpent with the Tiger eke, whiche are both fierce &amp; stronge Will neuer seeme at any time their younglinges for to greeue, But will them norish tenderly till they haue strength to liue. Is nature cleane exiled quite from thee, my cruell Sier? Is pittie put from out thy minde, to wreake on vs thy ire? Is fatherly loue cleane gon from thee? is mercy not in minde? Is crueltie crept into thee that thou art so vnkinde? Ah Gods, now farewell Phrygia soyle, farewell ay parents twayne Who seekes to put my loue and mee to death and cruell payne. Ah my beloued clarisia, I wayle to thinke of thee, That yu shouldest sustaine sutche wronge for loue thou bearest mee. Impute vnto thy louing knight no blame for this, my deere, For gladly if I could, I would haue taried with thee heere. Condi. Heere? then weare you vnwise if heere you would stay, tis plain To haue your lady and your self of all holden in disdain. And therfore without farther talke let vs abide no longer heere, If you do I am afrayd you are like to bie your tarying deere. LamphÂ«e.Â» Well then Conditions I pray thee wt speed our shipping prepare. Â«CoÂ»ndit. Tush tush, this is alredy done let that be the least end of your care, And therfore of all loues let vs be gone, least vnwares wee be tayn Misteris Clarisia, of all loues perswade him to depart amayne. Â«ClÂ»a. Ah my Lamphedon, wende we hence incontinent with speede For why, to worke our finall end they fully haue decreede. You neede not feare for want of ship, Conditions hath been thare, At the sea coast alredie sure our shippyng to prepare. And therfore let vs hence depart, and that incontinent. Â«LaÂ»mphe. Well then let vs depart, my deare, sith that you are so bent. Â«CÂ»ondi. Are they gone? Conditions? Nay double condicions is my name That for my owne aduantage suche dealynges can frame. Nay, if wee come in courte agayne to serue a kynge Hange mee if I giue not a thousand of them the flynge. To Thracie quoth you? there could be no better iorney for mee, Well I must begone, for I can neuer be well till I a ship bord bee. The Mariners within. Â«MÂ»aster. Ha la how, boyes a baste, ther cast haulser a land. Â«MÂ». mate Uere vere, come no neare least wee ground on the sand. Â«BÂ»oteswain Lanche out the Cocke boyes, and set the Master a shoare. Â«BÂ»oye.

Â«BÂ»oteswain It doth me good to see what booties we haue had on the seas, Which redownes to our profit, though to others disease. Â«BÂ»oy. Though I be but shipboy I must needs speake my minde If the whole seas were searched, such a shipful of theeues you could not finde. All. Speake soft goodman boy, least wee be espied. Condi. What Pirats? Nay incontinent I will haue that tried. Gogs wounds defende ye, for yle take you all my selfe. Master. Wilt thou so? nay, none but the shipboy shal deale with the elfe. Condi.

Come on then, strike it out at length: but what ar you mariners I will not deale then with you for all this land. For they bee good fellowes, they be no quarelers. BoteswaÂ«in.Â» Why not with Marriners I pray thee? come let vs try it out. Condi. Stay thy hand, it shall not be so, to put thee out of dout. Were it wt dry water souldiors I would deale if here were a skore For I haue dealt with fortie at a time and more. BoteswaÂ«in.Â» Then it were to mutche for me to deale with you alone. Condi. That is true, for of a littell man where I hit I breake the bone. Master. I pray you sir shew vs why you beare Mariners such good will? Condi. Because I am a Mariner my self and haue excellent good skill. BoteswaÂ«in.Â» And haue you sutch excellent good skill in deede, Then why like a landeman go you in sutch a weede? Condit. Lest the good deeds which I haue done on the seas Redowne to my small comfort and ease. BoteswaÂ«in.Â» Why then it seemes by thy talke thou hast bin a Pirat or this? Condi. Yea in faith haue I, and that knowes Mariners ships I wis, Master. By gogs bloud I will haue him a shipborde or els I will die. con. That is enough Ile take you at your word seyng there is no remedie, Wil you haue me a shipbord whether I wil or no? Master. Yea surely defende thee, for I intende so. Condici. Stay, stay, shall I be a sharer if quietly I go with you aborde? All. There is our hands, wee will make thee our captayn at a word. Condi. A captayne? here is my hande, to go with you as is your desier. But it were vncomly to play the sea man in landemans attyer. M. mate. No more thou shalt, for our other Captayne is dead, And thou shalt haue his attyer, and his roome, and lie in his bed. Condi. Well then come on and let vs a shipborde straight. All.

Come on then, let vs away, yt in Mariners attyer I were drest. Exeunt. Here entreth Mountagos with his daughter. Mountag. Come Sabia by and by and show your father straight and queeke, In what place in te body you be so sore seeke. My tinke you haue te greta deseza in te belly and te heda.

Ah cruell crabbed curish impe, ah stubborn strong stony hart, That can constraine a lady so to suffer dedly smart. How canst thou safely without shame denay a ladies proffer? Perchance thou mayst liue thrise so long and neuer haue like offer Ah heauenly powers do graunt that he may taste of my like paine And graunt he fancy one whose loue he neuer shall attaine. And furies all agree in one to broyle within her brest, Whom he shall fansy in such sort that shee may him detest. Then know I that he feeles my paine, then tasteth hee my greife, Then hope I that in time he will of mee take some releife. And that the same may come to pas Alecto perce her brest, That amongst all she vewes with eye, she may him most detest. So hope I that in time I shall perforce obtaine his loue, Through cunning skill of father mine, and helpe of gods aboue. Here entreth Lamphedon lamentinge. Lamphe Ah gods how haue I bin through Pirats force on seas surprest? When that we thought most quietly from foes to sayle at rest. How haue the gods bin changable, or mutabell in this case? How haue I bin on tumblinge waues sore tost from place to place How did those cruell Pirats they my corps cast into seas? And yelded me to Neptunes waues to cary me where he please. How rigorously delt they with mee and my Clarisia deare? Who I know well with cruelty was drowned with me there. Ah ye powers, is Lady mine bereft of life, or do I but surmise? Or do I but imagine so, or do I but deuise? Deuise what nede I to deuise on that with eares I heard? Then wretch vnto thy eares of force thou must giue most regarde Delt not they cruelly with thee? then what cause had they to stay But worke thy ladies finall end, as thou didest here them say? How can the swelling waues enclose that tender corps of thine? How could the cruell god of seas so vew thy latest fine. A Zepherus, would thou hadst closd my loue in thy sweete blast, When Pirats floung her ouerbourd, and on soft ground her cast, Why was it not my chance, alas to end my dayes in flood? Why did the powers assine to mee to land in place so good? Ha wretch hast thou for got that lady thine in seas is dround? Draw forth thy lingering blade with speede, &amp; giue thy self a wo?d, Sith that her ioy was ioy to thee, let her death be thine also, And with this goring blade of thine deuide this hart from wo. Here entreth the Mariners with a songe. Lustely, lustely, lustely, let vs sayle forth, The winde trim doth serue vs, it blowes at the north All thinges wee haue ready and nothing wee want, To furnish our ship that rideth hereby: Uictals and weapons they be nothing skant, Like worthy mariners our selues wee will try, Lustely lustely, &amp;c. Her flagges be new trimmed set flanting aloft. Our ship for swift swimming oh shee doth excell, Wee feare no enemies, we haue escaped them oft, Of all ships that swimmeth shee bareth the bell. Lustely, lustely, &amp;c. And here is a master excelleth in skill, And our masters mate hee is not to seeke: And here is a boteswaine will do his good will, And here is a ship boy wee neuer had his leeke. Lustely lustely, &amp;c. If fortune then faile not, and our next viadge proue. Wee will returne merely and make good cheere: And hould all together as freends linkt in loue, The cannes shalbe filled with wine ale and beere. Lustely, lustely, &amp;c. Master. Hay liuely by gogs bloud this booty was for our purpose fit, It doth me good to thinke how I whorld him ouer bord yet. Boteswa And it doth me good to heare the lady at euery woord, Desire vs not to whorle her louer ouer borde. But shee might cry her fill, for shee was neuer the sooner heard, For I helpt to whorle him ouer bord to her crying I toke no regard Wh? our captaine heard it hee was in a rage yt it was strange to se And out of hand would needs fight, and said it was longe of mee. Master. Seeing our captaine is gon with the lady to Marofus Ile away, Let vs make haste a shipborde, without longer delay. Boteswa Content Master we intend to tary no longer here. Lamphe Nay stay you Impes of limbo lake, I waight your coming nere Ah wretches who haue dround my loue in flouds of cruell force, Defend you straight, for I do waight to wreke it on your corse. Wherfore, I say, defend you straight, my force you sure shall try, Master. Ah wretch, and art thou yet aliue? be sure we will the not deny Ah gods what chance is this that hee should swim to land? I repent by gods I sweare I tide him not foot and hand. But well, sith that thou skaped art from drowning in this case, Prepare thy selfe, either thou or wee shall end their liues in place. Wherfore ah wretch wee thee defy as enemy to thy face. Lamphe In hope of victory I of you in my sweet ladies case. And therfore wretches prepare you to dy. Boteswa They were but fooles that from thee would fly.

In hope to heare good newes of thee, I sure pardon thee shall. Stand vp &amp; let mee heare with speede what thou canst here expresse Â«MÂ»aster. Well, sith there is no remedy the truth I shall confesse Thy lady shee hath still her life, and arriued in Phrygia here, But going to Marofus Ile to liue as captiue there, For why, we sent our captaine now to sell hir if he might, To one Cardolus, who doth keepe that Ile by valiant fight. Whom when he hath, he doth enclose in mighty turret hye, To se if any dares presume his force and strength to try. And lest that he should seeme perforce to take her and not pay, Wee sent our captaine who will try his strength both night &amp; day, Unles he haue what is his dewe, lo here, O worthy knight, Uouchsafe to haue remorce of mee who haue exprest the right, And graunt that I may now depart with this my life away. Â«LÂ»amphe. In hope thou hast exprest the truth I minde thee not to stay. Well for this once I pardon thee, depart hence when thou please, Â«MÂ»aster. Then lustily once more by gogs bloud to the seas. Why I thinke it be my desteny to be hanged or dround, I thinke neuer to dy in my bed for a hundred pound. Exit. Â«LÂ»amphe. Proceede Lamphedon coragiously Cardolus strength to try, And either win thy loue perforce, or in his hands do dye. Shall Lady thine thus liue a thrall to tyrant fierce of might? Shall thy sweete Lady waile for wo in turret day and night? No Lamphedon, let footsteps thine be prest to Marofus to trade, In hope for to subdew the wretch with this thy goring blade. Let manly courage there be showne let valiant hart be tried, Let not this profered challenge eke of the once be denyed. Shall my Lady liue his thrall? no Cardolus thinke not but I, Though thou hast Herculus force thy might and strength will try. Or if that Cerberus his might did rest in body thine, I would not dout for ladies sake thy vytall dayes to fine. Which dun, my ioyes would new increase wher sorowes yet berife If that through helpe of mighty Marce I may obtaine my wife Here entreth Clarisia and Condicions Condit Misteris clarisia cast of care, For your Lord Lamphedon do not feare He is in health though you thinke him to be dround, And there of I dare lay fiue hundred pound. cla. Oh conditions, on that condicion I thinke all trauell no paine, If thereby I mought win my Lamphedon againe. But, ha allas, he is drownd I am sure. Condi. Lady Clarisia, leue of this talke, that your greifes doth procure. If you will follow my counsell and cast of all this dout, I will deuise a meanes to finde my Lord Lamphedon out. Clarisia Yes conditions I am content and do agree to thy will, Condi. Then in one respecte you must needs my request herein fulfill. And that is this, you must be come a seruant to a knight, Who dwelleth here hard by, who Leostines hight. And whilst you abide there, my self wil go search all about Night and day, vntill I haue found my lord Lamphedon out, And when I haue found him, doubt you not but that we twaine, Will by a suttell meanes conuay you from thence againe, How say you lady to my deuice, are you herein content. Clarisia Yes conditions, to thy counsell I could well consent, If therby I mought obtaine my louing knight againe. Condi. Doubt you not that I will omit any kinde of paine. Untill I haue found him either on sea or land, Beleue me as I am an honest gentleman here is my hand. But I must request one thinge more you must change your vsuall name Lest you being knowen all our woes would frame. And wheras your name is clarisia, let it Metrea bee, Which done, I doubt Â«notÂ» but your knight in good helth you shall see. Clarisia I warant thee my name is Metrea what soeuer they say. Condi. Well you must your selfe to the knights place take your way. But besides, you must counterfit your progeny as you may, Lest in vttering the same you worke your owne decay. Clarisia Doubt you not Conditions for that I was borne in Phrygia here Condi. That is sufficient, what soeuer they demaund, hould you there. Well Lady here lies the ready way towards the knights place, Depart when you please, I must seke out my master in any case. Clarisia Content conditions, and farewell till we mete againe. Â«CÂ»ondit.

Ha now a plague of al such vilains yt caused vs haue such gret?g Ha my good mistres leaue you of your wayling so sore for mee. For I know you to wel, kinde harted for to bee. What is she gone? haue I bin howling all this while &amp; know not wherfore Nay and she be gone so soone, by her leaue ile lament no more. Ah sira, to see the dissimulation of a craftie counterfit knaue, That by flatterie can brynge to pas the thinge he would haue. Wept quoth you? I haue wept in deed to put you out of doubt, Euen as mutch as wil driue halfe a dousen milles aboute. But I must laugh to thinke on my Pirats filching knaues, Their captayne hath boarde them through their noses like slaues. They were not contented to make me captain to serue them abord But they must make a Marchant of me with target and sword? Thinking I would deale with Cardolus if he would take her away Nay by your leaue for weemens causes ill deale with no such play. Fight whoso list, for mee. But by this meanes I haue deuised to set the Lady free. I would not be a borde agayne for fiue hundreth pounde, I dare sweare in one hower I should be both hanged, kild, &amp; drownd well let me se whether shal I trace my Maister for to finde? Let me see? welfare a head that can bryng sutch things in minde. It may be that he hath heard the Pirats for to say, That they would send his Lady to Marofus Ile to sell her away. And that he is gone thither to win hir from him agayne, Here is no remedie I must thither, and that a mayne. Exit. Here entreth Lamphedon. Lamphe. Though depe dispaire doth driue in doubt dew honor to disgrace. Though dredful domps doth da?t ye minde being in vncoth place Though hart is harded to hasard forth in ladies cause to try, Against her cruell crabbed fo, and venture life to dy. Yet must he be aduisedly, and in such kinde of sort, That as well through wit as strength it may deserue report. Therfore Lamphedon take good hart like Troyelus in strength, And liue in hope through fearce assault to foyll thy fo at length. Though that thou want Vlyses skill for to imagin iust. Or to deuice in rightest wise which way begin thou must, Bee bold in hart through fearce assault thy cruell fo to foyle, And end his days to merit prayse, or yeeld thee to the spoyle. I straight will sammon on his shield to try his force and strength, In hope through helpe of mighty Marce to win the field at length Thou Tirant Cardolus, who dost inclose within thy fortres strong Faire ladies to their mortal griefe, and proferst them such wrong. Come forth, for lo Mawger thy force Ile sommon on thy shield, In hope to set those Ladies free, and end thy dayes in fielde. Here entreth Cardolus. CardoluÂ«s.Â» What vaunting varlet dares presume to try cardolus strength? Who neuer delt wt none as yet but foyled them all at length? Who dares a liue presume to tread within Marofus Ile, Except hee lycence craue of mee: Ile cause him straight requyle. What wight aliue dares once presume to somon on my shielde? Who dares presume for ladies cause to try my strength in field? And yet my thought I heard some one to somon on the same. Tysh cardolus, he is fled for drede and hides his hed for shame, LamphÂ«e.Â» No cardolus, thinke not but I who present here do stand, Dare try thy strength with corage bould, &amp; foyle thee hand to hand. What thinkest thou that I come to thee, to somon on thy shielde, And dare not vew thy warlike showe, that thou dost make in field? Yes yes cardolus prepare thy selfe, if so thou thinkest best, For lo to set those ladies free behould I here am prest. And therfore yeeld them straight to me from out thy prison strong, Or els prepare, to try thy strength I will no time prolong. CardoluÂ«s.Â» Alas pore wretch, what meanest thou to trace from natiue soyle To end thy daies, by me thy fo within Marofus Ile? Thinkest yu thy selfe meet matched, wretch, to deale in fight wt mee In faith princox, I doubt not but soone thy courage coolde shall bee. Lamphe What cardolus first let vs try, and when that wee haue done, Let him that doth subdew his so vaunt of the victory wone. For why, the wight that reckeneth before that hee obtaine, May chance to recken twice, and then his reckning is in vaine. So thou to vaunt of victory before thou gaine the same. Maist chaunce to haue thy Pecoks tail brought low vnto thy shame And therfore let vs first begin, and when that wee haue doone. Let him triumphe with victorie that hath the conquest woone. Â«CaÂ»rdolus. Saist thou me so prinkox, with speed then defend thee. Â«LaÂ»mphe. Do thy worst Cardolus I feare not so I intend mee. Â«CaÂ»rdolus. O gods, for want of breath my might beginnes to fayle. Â«LaÂ»mphe. Then Lustily Lamphedon thy fo to assayle. Â«CaÂ»rdolus. O stay sir knight, end not through fight my daies, but graunt me grace Â«LaÂ»mphe. A wretch I denay thee, for I intend to slay thee or I fr? hence trace. Â«CÂ»ardolu. O stay thy hand most worthy knight, and grant to me my life, And thou shalt see if in my hould there do remaine thy wife. Â«LÂ»amphe. Nay wretch that shall me not suffice, for I will straight set free All ladies that within thy hould as yet remaining bee. And yet besides Ile end thy daies or I from hence do go. Â«CÂ»ardolus. O stay thy hand most worthy knight, and worke not my last wo. All that which apertaynes to mee I fully yeld to thee, If so thou wilt ostend thy grace, and pardon graunt to mee. Â«LÂ»amphe. Well, I am perswaded in my minde thy pardon for to graunt, All though at first or we begone of victory thou didst vaunt. Yet shall it be to this entent, thou yeerely shalt resine For this Marofus Ile the which I may now keepe as mine Fyue hundred crownes yerely to pay at penticost the same, Or else be sure the sum vnpayd, Ile end thy dayes with shame, And eke besides ile set them free that in thy hould do rest. How sayst thou now, do answere mee as please thy fansy best. cardolus. O worthy knight I graunt thereto the tribute for to pay, And liue thy thrall at becke and call vntill my dying day. And eke beside those ladies which thou camst for to set free. Take here the keys with humble hart I yeeld them all to thee. Lamphe, Well then stand vp, cardolus, straight and let vs hence depart, For who to vew my lady she I do desier with hart. Wherfore Cardolus come away I charge thee straight with speed, Cardolus. I redy am to waight Sir knight when you shall thinke it neede. Here entreth Nomides. Nomides. Ah gods, what wight hath greater cause for to lament then I, That caused am to craue the thing that oft I did deny? What wight would sew vnto his fo whom oft he did offend? Or mercy craue at any time of cruell crabbed frend? Ha Nomides thou forsed art to bow to Cupid hee, Whom thou before didst so abhor his captiue thrall to bee. Why did I spight like retchles knight thy cunning state or force? Why did I eke this defame speake, iust cause of no remorce. Ha gods, am I become a louer now, or sewter for to bee, Who earst did force no whit for loue, nor for cupido hee? Would gods when first I vewed the sight of Metrea that dame, Whose cumly fauour it was that forste my hart to flame, I had bin vewing of the thing which man doth most detest, Then should not wofull louers paines haue broyled in my brest. Ha Metrea, wolde gods my sore were in thy brest a griefe, Then would I nothing doubt but that in time to haue releefe. Why Nomides, doost thou not know shee is but a seruant shee? And thou a knight, and valiant wight of famous stocke to bee. Why shouldest yu ought dispayre herein, but boulden forth my hart Sith that thou art constrained through force of blinde Cupidos dart But ha alas, this greeues my hart that Leostines her Master hee, Of longe hath bin for former grudge an enemy to mee. Which will bee cause I may not come to speake with her at all, Nor vew her crystall hew whose sight it was that forst my fall. But stay, good newes, I see here enters thy Ladies woman foole, Whom shee for charity toke in, and kepeth yet to schoole. Now shall I know of simple soule where my sweete Lady is, Or send her letter if I please, and of her sight not misse. Here entreth Lomia the naturall. Lomia. Hey delading delading dats a good boy, Thou shalt go with me a sonday. Ha barlaking I am a trim scholler, and a good wench indeede. My lady sayes and I will learne well and take heede, Shee will giue me a trim veluet cap with a fether, To put on my head against colde weather. And my lady will make me a trim longe cote downe to the ground And if any wil mary mee, she wil giue him twenty &amp; a h?dred po?d My lady can dance, so shee can and I must learne to, Else I shall neuer get me a husband, for all that euer I can do, And my Lady can play tedull tedul in a paire of virgine holes. And I must learne euery day, to as soone as I haue fet in coles. My Lady wilbe heare anone, and we must walke togethr, If it hould vp and do not raine but be faire weather. Dats a good baby cry out than. And thou shalt haue a napell a nan. Â«NÂ»omides. Now hope doth say I shall obtaine the sight of Lady deare, If for her sake some paynes I take to stay her comming heare. Ile fall in talke with this her foole till shee aproche in place, Wherby I may more familierly declare to her my case. How now faire lady, whether pas you this way? Â«LÂ»omia. For sooth my lady her none selfe did? Â«NÂ»omides. What did thy lady? Â«LÂ»omia. Mary giue me leaue to go play. Â«NÂ»omides. Who is thy lady and what is thy name? Â«LÂ»omia. I am Lomia and she my Lady Metrea that late hither came. Â«NÂ»omides. How sayst thou, my Lady Lomia, wilt thou change cotes wt mee? Â«LÂ»omia. No thinke not you haue a foole in hand I waraunt yee. Â«NÂ»omides. Why Lomia, my cloke will become thee excellent and braue, Â«LÂ»omia. Away Ile none of your clokes Ile tell my lady you are a knaue. I can not on my ladies arant go, But you wilbe medling with maids whether they will or no. If thou werst no honester then I thou wouldst play the knaue, But Ile tell my lady on thee so I will what thou wouldest haue. Â«NÂ»omides. Nay Lomia do not and Ile giue thee a peny to by thy baby clouts. Â«LÂ»omia. A you mocke so you do, you do but flowts. Gafer a you mocke, yowil giue vs none at all, Â«NÂ»omides. Here it is Lomia to by thee a Minefur cap or a call. Â«LÂ»omia. O god, is it good to eate gafar, how say you? Â«NÂ»omides. Taste it Lomia, tis some hard to disgest I tell you trew. Â«LÂ»omia. O god, O god Ile tell my Lady shee will be here by and by, That you giue fokes hard geare to eat to make them cry. O god my Lady come to this hangman, And beat him away. Here entreth Metrea. Â«MÂ»etrea. How now my Lady Lomia, how chance it you do stay? Â«LÂ»omia. My Lady heres a hangman wil not let maides alone, But giues fokes hard geare to eat, as hard as a bone, Â«MetreaÂ». Did he Lomia we wil put water in his poraige &amp; cut his rost meat with a knife But perchance he is inamored of thee, hee will haue the to his wife Lomia. Ile be none of his wife my lady he is a trim husband for you, NomideÂ«s.Â» I perceue though fooles want discression yet their meaning are trew Faire lady in absence yours as I abroade did trace, I met your femall foole, with whom I had conferrance for a space. Of which I hope you will accept the same in way of Iest. And not to iudge of simple men as wemen thinke it best. Metrea. Though wemen some there be that iudge of men deuoyd of skil Ther are sure thrice as many men that deme of wemen yll. Â«Nomides.Â» And therfore sure that argues not, men do the worst they can, And wemen, by your leaue, at times will do as yll as man. Metrea. What tho, Syr knight, lets leaue this talke I am no pleader I, Nomides. Yet hear my talke, O perles dame, and then seeme to reply, Metrea. At your request a while Ile stay, your talke sir knight to heare. Nomides Th? hope I that nought but trew faith in mee shal wel appere. Lady, ye wo?ded deare whose tender brest is prest wt quarrel gro?d And forced eke through fierce assaulte to yeeld to rauening hound. For spilling bloud to issue out from tender brest apace, Beginnes to trudge with tripell steps before his foes in chase, The egar hound pursues a maine till dear his fome doth cast In midst of way, which plaine doth show he nere hath run his last, The hound whose nature is to know what state the dear is in, For to procure more fresh assault he straight doth there begin. And at the length he pulles him downe, except he water take, Which if he may, then is he sure the houndes will him forsake. So I whose hart is clouen in twaine through quarell fercely shot, That from my tender brest the blood like fountaines droppeth hot, Am faine like deare through greedy hound from herd for to depart By reason of the blinded boy that did me so subuert. The hounds of griefe vnherdid me, and drowned me in chace, Where I with tripell steppes did flye, but they persued a pace, Till at the length my strength did waste and running eke did faile For why, the hounds of deepe dispaire my sensis did so assaile. The froth also is redy cast vpon my tender backe, For why, alas they me persued, but I being to slacke. Now want I nought but water brooke, which if I may obtaine, O Lady deare then am I sure from hounds to scape vnslayne, Lo heare deare dame, iudge of the same as lightly as you may. Â«MÂ»etrea. I shall sir knight vnto my might and simple skill here say, A cursed may that Brooke be sure that would not you imbrace, For whose sweet sake you wounded were, and eke pursued in chase Her siluer streames, vnworthy is her wounted course to keepe, And for sutche an enuious offence a thousand woes to reepe, But if I weare the Brooke, sir knight, and that it lay in mee, To ayde you from your cruell foes, and from this miserie, I would. Wherfore accept sir knight my good will if you please. Â«NÂ»omides. Fayre Lady, in none but you it lieth my sorowes for to ease. Tis you your selfe, O noble dame, whom you accused thus, Who neuer knew my greif before, the truthe for to discus. You are the streames for whose sweete sake I haue desired so, After my greeuious wounde once giuen to skape to, from my fo. Accept, my sute, O pereles dame, denay not my good will, But yeeld to me my wished pray which I desired still. And let me not for your sweet sake, O Lady, dye for loue. Â«MÂ»etrea. Sir knight, there stay, demaund the thinge no more yt wil not proue I am al redy linkt in loue with one who faithfull is. For whose sweet sake Ile neuer loue if of his loue I mis. Â«NÂ»omides. Why Lady, then you kill my hart for aye. Â«MÂ»etrea. What nay? take a man to play such a part &amp; the night shalbe day Come Lomia, let vs hence straight wende. Â«NÂ»omides. Why Lady? then my life shall ende. Â«MÂ»etrea. No no sir knight, you neede not feare. Â«NÂ»omides. Well Lady, for your sweet sake the greifs I beare. Â«MÂ»etrea. Come, rise Lomia, and let vs hence away. Exit. Â«LÂ»omia. Yes forsooth my Lady, shall wee go play? Gafar I thanke you for my peny to by my baby some cloutes. O God, hangman you, I forgot to tell that you did floutes. Exit. Â«NÂ»omides. O gods, how like is this the suet of Lady Sabia shee, who seekes eche way both night and day to gayn the loue of mee? Now may I say that heauenly powers doth iustly me reward, For that to Sabias profered loue I tooke so light regard. Yet shall not this dismay me ought, yet once more will I proue, Experience showes faint harted knights wins neuer fayre ladies loue And weemen are of nature such, they alwayes do requier, That men should seeke and also creep to gayne that they desier. Here entreth Lamphedon. Lamphe O Gods, what wight is pincht with payne as is Lamphedon hee. What hart hath had so sodaine ioy and straight such miserie? Clarisia for thy sake I forced nought to trie cardolus strength, In hope for to haue founde thee there to bred my ioy at length. But ha alas hope fayles mee now, experience plaine doth tell, That cruell Pirats drownd my loue, in foming waues that swel. In vaine I did the combat fight with stout cardolus hee, Would gods it had now bin his chaunce in fight to haue slaine mee Not Tantalus in hell doth feele the torments which I taste, Nor Sisiphus who rowles the stone, and it rebounds in haste. Not all the Furies in like case, nor Impes of Limbo lake, Scars feels the torments I sustayne for my deare Ladies sake. Wel Lamphed? sith Lady thine is dead, &amp; drowned long time since, Prepare to ende thy vitall dayes or thou depart from hence. Draw foorth thy blade, seeke to inuade, the breath that lies in breast Regard not life, since care and strife will neuer let thee rest. But first ye Muses nine refraine from notes of woonted ioy, And from your instruments so sweet to wayle my great anoy. Now seace thy playnts Lamphedon wretch, &amp; end thy cares &amp; wo, And rid thy life with goryng knife or thou from Ile dost go. And powers do graunt for to receaue my soule to heauens hie, And that it there may take rest wher my sweet Lady doth lie. Here entreth Conditions. Condi. Stay thy hand Cardolus, for I come not for to fight, As I am an honest Gentilman, and a right courteous knight. Lamphe Ha Gods, good newes I hope, for this the captain sure should be. With whom they say they sent my loue to sell to cardolus hee. Come foorth yu wretche and straight confesse wher my deare lady is Or els to worke thy finall end, be sure I shall not mis. Condit. Ha Cardolus, I minde not fight to gayne fiue hundered pound. Lamphe Then wherfore didst thou venter to tread on his ground? Condi. Ha, to bring you such newes as is for your ease. Lamphe. What is that, expresse it quickly and seeme not to lease. Condi. If you take me with a lie, hange me like a counterfeit knaue. Lamphe. Come forth, if it be for my behoofe, dew pardon thou shalt haue. Condi. Ha, was there euer villaine in suche kinde of takyng as I, I am so beset that tis vnpossible to deuise a lie, And shall please you cardolus there is a certayne knight, Commyng to win away one of your Ladies fayre by fight. Now, I for good will I beare you came to tell you the same, Least in suddaine at vnwares your woes he should chance to frame For he is the veriest sot that euer lookt champion on the face, I dare sweare if you giue him a blowe he would run hence a pace. Lamphe. If all this be true, I thanke thee for thy good will, But I pray thee expresse his name that mindeth me such ill. Condi. Ah now am I readie to beray my self for feare. For I am in doubt that Lamphedon already hath bin heare. Well whither he hath or not, the truth needes I must say, Least I beeyng proued contrarie, should worke my owne decay: Ha and shall please you, Lamphedon is his name. The dukes sunne of Phrygia, that pretendeth the same. Lamphe. Ha wretche where is my Lady thou broughts to sel to Card. hee Confesse the trouthe, or be thou sure thy dayes soone ended shalbe. Condi. Ha Cardolus, stay thy hand, ile fight for no Lady I. Lamphe. No wretche my name is Lamphedon &amp; that thou soone shalt trie Condi. Iesus know you not me, I am conditions your man, And for naught els but to seeke you only I hither ran. Lamphe. Conditions stand vp, I haue subdued cardolus &amp; am neuer ye near And haue set all his captiues free but Clarisia is not theare, Whiche breedeth my care, and impaireth my wealth. Condi. Be of good cheare, noble Lamphedon, your Lady is in health. But is in Phrygia as a seruant with Leostines hee, And liueth in great greif and miserie. For why, she thinks you not aliue but drownd this is plaine. Lamphe. Ha Gods is this true Conditions, and dost thou not faine? Condit. Iesus, why when did you take me with a lie? Be bould, that which I once say, I will not denie. Lamphe. How came my Lady to be a seruant I pray thee expresse Cond. As wee trace on our way the whole to you I shall confesse. But where is Cardolus, noble knight, that he is not in place? Lam. I haue pardoned him, conditions, and graunted him grace, Upon condition he shall neuer offend lady agayne, And eke to yeld me tribute whilst life hee doth retaine. Condi. Well then let vs be Ioging towards your lady apace, Lamphe. That is the place to which I most desier for to trace. Wherfore with speede, condicions, come let vs away, Exit. Condi. Proceede on for by your leaue I minde not here to stay. I would it had bin my chance to trie with Cardolus hee. Ha tis a wonder that sutch strength in a litle mans arme should be But by your leaue tis good to be mery and wise the truth to say, Tis not for the weake hart with the Lion for to play. Wel there is no remedie, I must after my master Lamphedon hee. For I dare swear hee thinkes it longe till with his Lady hee bee, Here entreth Leostines with Metrea. Leostines Lady Metrea, and seruant eke, attentiue be with speede. For why to rest thy faithfull freind beholde I haue decreede. Sith that the powers haue lent to me none heyre for to enioy My Lordship great when sisters three shall breede my last anoy, And sith in sutch strange kinde of sort thou hapnedst to mee. Thou shalt from this time forth, deare dame, no more a seruant be But I will take thee as my owne, and only daughter deare, For that I se virginitie in thee doth still appeare. And when that death shall end my daies, &amp; I to ground am throwne For vertues that in you wee se receaue euen as thine owne My landes and lordships euery deal, but if the powers graunt life, Wee will do what there lieth in vs, to spouse thee as a wife Unto some knight of famous stocke, and so prefer thy state, In matchyng thee with sutch a one, as shall thee not forsake. Lo here deare dame accept mee still euen as thy only sier, And when yu wants, aske what thou wilt, thou shalt haue thy desier Metrea. Right louing lorde Leostines, and only master eke, Whose hart is set and also bent my only ioyes to seeke: Do graunt your simple seruant here to vtter foorth her minde, And then accept her as she is, and as you do her finde. Leostines. Why Metrea, aske what thou wilt, I am contented I. Metrea. Then ayde Appollo pleasant Muse mee rightly to reply. Right reuerend lorde Leostines, and Master in like case, I yeeld your highnesse intire thankes, and if the gods graunt grace, I shall your simple foundling, here still dewtifull remaine. Else the heauens me consume with speede, &amp; end my daies wt paine I am your simpell seruant here, and still would gladly rest, But that your highnes hath deuisd what for my state is best. Yet haue I one thing to demaund, O worthy lorde, of thee, Which if I may obtaine, I doubt in happy state to bee. Leostines. Why what is that my Metrea? do straight expresse the same, Metrea. Tis all my whole desier, deare Lorde, to gaine a virgins name. Leostines. Why Metrea, what should you so desier to liue in such a solum sort And through your singel life in time, to gain some mis report? Why should you eke disdaine the state of wedlocke in this case? Or seeme for to abuse the law of Iunos noble grace? No do not so, my Metrea deare sith that dame nature shee, Hath framed with skilfull workmanship such cumlines in thee. Thou mayst in time obtaine some one vnto thy louing feere, As will thee count his chiefest Ioy, and onely darling deere. Wherfore be rewld, perswade thy minde, incline to my request, And I will seeke, if god permit, what for thy state is best. Which shalbe also to thy minde, if so thou wilt agree. Metrea. Ye heauens still do strengthen mee. Deare lord Leostines, more to say my tounge vnable is, To render you the entire thankes that you deserue I wis. Yet hope I that your honnor will consider as you finde, Sith that my tounge vnable is to vtter as I minde. So graunt your simple seruant here to liue in Dians chase, For so shee sets her whole delight eche folly to displace. Shee forceth nought of Iunos games, shee countes them but abuse, To rest in true virginity such games she will refuse. Lo here, deare lorde, do graunt to her in virgins state to rest, For why I thinke and deme in minde that for my state is best. And not for that I thinke my wit should pas your noble skill, But from my infancy till now haue I request it still. Lo heere, deere lord, on knees I craue the somme of my desier. Leostines. Stand vp Metrea, sith thou wilt needs, thou shalt the same aspier I am content that thou shalt liue in virgines sacred law, So that with out my full consent from thence thou neuer draw. No this is all I binde thee to, answere mee I craue. Metrea. No more I will not, noble lord, more then I all redy haue, Leostines. Well then come on let vs depart with speede to court againe. Metrea To wayght vpon your noble state I will omit no paine. O gods shall loue of goods constraine mee now my knight forsake? Or flattering woords alure me once my wonted loue to slake? Shall profered courtesie constraine mee, or moue my setled minde, That at my louing lords returne he falsly should me finde, No no Lamphedon, for thy sweet sake Ile euer faithfull rest, Though they should seeme wt goring blade to perce my tender brest Enter Condi. But wo be to thy parents those that did vs so diseas, And caused vs to fly from them for dread, vnto the seas. Wo be vnto those Pirates they, that did with cruell hand, Euen drowne my loue before my face except hee swom to land. Wo be vnto that cruell king euen of Arabia soyle, Whose cruelty was chefest cause we vndertooke this toyle. And last of all, wo bee vnto condicions that wretch, Who left me here vnto my grief by suttell crafty fetch. Now am I sure my Lord is dround though he did beare in hand, When Pirats flong him out of ship through force he swam to land Now am I sure he did but faine, to leaue mee here behinde, When that hee sayd he would a broade my louing Lord to finde. A cruell crafty peuish elfe, ha flattering fained frende, That through thy fayned forged talke deceuedst me in the end. Condi. Iesus Madame why make such lamentation for the losse of mee Metrea. Ha, I am as the Turkel hath lost her make &amp; more if worse may bee Condi. Why Lady, you haue no such cause for to complaine. Metrea. Yes conditions, for all that thou saidst I see thou doost but faine. Cond. Nay lady that shall you proue contrary your selfe by and by, Lamphedon come forth in continent to disproue a lye. Here entreth Lamphedon imbracing his Lady. Metrea. Lamphedon? ha gods, thrice welcome vnto mee. Lamphe And thrice as welcome, noble dame, vnto Lamphedon hee, Who long hath wayld with pensiuenes the want of thee, my deare, But now he doth reioyce in hart that he hath found thee heare. Ha my deare Lady for thy sake I hazard did my life. And did subdew Cardolus hee with battering blowes so ryfe. In hope for to haue founde thee there, but seinge it was in vaine, I sought most desperatly to end my daies with cruell paine. But ha, I haue to yeeld the powers most entire thankes &amp; prayse, In that they sent conditions hee, else had I finde my dayes. As I in time, most constant dame, the whole shall show to thee, And partly I perceiue, my deare, thy constancy towards mee. The which through fame is blasd a broad vnto thy lasting praise, And shall in bookes regestered be when death shall finde thy dayes. Lo to thy fame most constant dame report hath blased this. Â«MeÂ»trea. And to thy prayse thy name to rayse report will neuer misse. But, ha Condicions, pardon graunt and mercy eke ostend, For blaming thee without a cause who neuer did offend. Â«CoÂ»ndi. Pardon? how can you aske pardon and do him such offence? By your leaue roome therfore, I must needs hence. Â«LaÂ»mphe. Nay Conditions stay and pardon my Lady if shee did offend, And be sure for thy courtesy I will reward thee in the end. Â«CoÂ»ndi. I haue bin a cutter amongst wemen though now at the last cast, Well Madame through intreatie my anger now is past. Here entreth Lomia for hir misteris and the vice iustling hir. Â«LoÂ»mia. O God this littell hangman is iustling maides against the wall? For if I had not stand stiffe to I had catcht a great fall. Â«CoÂ»ndi. Whom haue we hear margery milke ducke, or flower of ye frying pan Or Ione of the Iakes house, or misteris Marian? Shee hath a face like a howlet and when shee begins to frowne, There are no more wrinkels in her forhed th? in ye backe of a gown Â«LoÂ»mia. Madam this same hangman is lusty &amp; can not let one be in rest. Let mee a lone, Ile tell my Lady so you were best. My lady, my lorde Leostler praise you come to him straight, Â«MeÂ»trea. Stay a while, Lomia, and a non on his honour I will waight. My lorde Lamphedon, come and wend we hence to court our way, Where we do minde most secretly your person to conuay. Into our chamber, where we will awhile our selues recreat, And then vpon your luckles chance we minde for to debate. And so in time conuay our selues through priuy fetch away, For why to liue in seruitude I sure ne will, nor may. Â«LaÂ»mphe. Ha constant dame vnto thy freend, whose peere is not aliue, That to gaine thy frend his c?pany such pleas?t featch canst driue. I sure am now constrained through force for to account thee wise. Â«MeÂ»trea. Nay, my loue, not I, for it was Condicions deuise. LamphÂ«e.Â» Condicions? ha gods, sure in such matters thou doost passe, Condi. Know you not how yt in wemens matters I am wisest yt euer was LamphÂ«e.Â» Sure so thou art, but lady we must about it secretly, Lest some belonging to your lorde our dealings chance to spy. Which might through their impoysened hate procure our care and wo And so our secreats be disclosd or we from hence do go. Metrea. I warrant you my lord, you neede not so to feare. LamphÂ«e.Â» Well lady let vs go for I desier for to be there. Condicions stay thou heare a while vntill we do retier. Exit. Condi. Gods sames is it euen so wel, dispatch gentleman I hartely desier Ha ha this geare cottons, now if her master Leostines hee, Knew that Lamphedon in lady Metreas chamber should bee, There were all the sport and pastime that should excell, Lomia. Gods efaith I care not, for I wull tell. Condi. Gods sames, Lomia, what wilt thou tell, and of what? Lomia. Of my lady, and of the trim gentleman, and thou goodman squat Condit. Why Lomia, what didst thou see mee do, I pray thee declare? Lomia. No no, Ile tell my lorde, so I will, I do not care. Cond. Then will I thrust my dagger in thy belly by and by, Lomia. O god I will not tell and you will not make mee cry. Condi. Then what wilt thou say when thou commest to Leostines hee? Lomia. For sooth Ile say twas not you that kist my lady, twas hee. Condi. Gods sames wilt thou so, let me heare thee say so if thou dare, Lomia. No I wonnot say so, Ile say my lady did not spare. But kist you both first and then you kist her againe, When I come there I will not tel of you twaine. Condi. Wilt thou? then will I kill thee, and that out of hand, Lomia. I won not say my lady lead a man to her chamber by the hand. Condi. In faith this geare is at a mad kinde of stay, Ha that I were able to fly from hence away. The foole will vtter all to Leostines that shee hath heard or seene, Alas Lamphedon thou wildst wish this day had neuer beene. Gods sames, I wolde I were hanged on some gebit that is stronge Here entreth Leostines with a lorde or two more. Leostines My lorde I maruell why Metrea, absents her selfe so long? It seemeth that shee wayeth no whit our counsel geuen of late, That thus her wonted courtesie shee seemes for to abate. Â«LorÂ»des. It may be so, O worthy Lorde, as you haue heare exprest. Â«LeoÂ»stines. My Lorde attend me, I may not rest till truth shalbe confest. Â«LoÂ»mia. My Lorde you wone not se my bord, you looke another waye. Â«LeoÂ»stines. What Lomia are you heare? how chanceth it you do staye, And bryng mee no more word from your misteris agayne? Â«LoÂ»mia. Why forsooth, my Lord, I thought mutch to take so mutch pain Â«LeÂ»ostines. Where is thy Misteris, Lomia, that wee cannot her see? Â«LoÂ»mia. Il tell my Lorde on you now, because you did beate mee. My Lorde, I wonnot tel my Lorde and yo will put vp your thinge. Â«LeÂ»ostines. What, is there any that would seeme to flynge, Or profer the foole any kinde of wronge? Â«LoÂ»rds. It is but the fooles fashions, noble Lorde, the time to prolonge, Â«LoÂ»mia. My Lorde, I did se nobody kis my Lady, so I did not law. Â«LeÂ»ostines. I see the foole hath hard &amp; seen some thing that she standeth in aw Â«LoÂ»mia. My Lord, my Lady is not gon to her ch?ber wt a gentilman shee. Â«LeÂ»ostines. My Lords how like you this, it seemes she hath oft disceyued mee Â«LordsÂ». Of trouth, deare lorde Leostines, wee needs must deem it so. Â«LeÂ»ostines. If this prooue true, let them be sure, that I will worke their wo Â«LoÂ»mia. No forsooth my Lorde, my Lady did not say so, forsooth twas hee. Â«LeÂ»ostines. Why? what did he say? Â«LoÂ»mia. Mary giue you poison to drincke, and cary my Lady away. Law, I did not tell of you, will you beat mee any more. Â«CoÂ»ndi. Gogs wounds, out of my sight you crooked nose whore, By his wounds what shift shall I make to skape away from hence I stand in such a quandary that I would giue my life for two p?ce. Let me alone, it is good to saue one, as far as I can see, I will step in and affirme the fooles talke most true to bee. So if the woorst fall I shall be sure my selfe for to saue cleare, Though my Master Lamphedon and his Lady bie it deare. Ha Lorde Leostines all is true, that the foole hath confest, For I my self did heare all in like case as is exprest. Â«LÂ»eostines. Is all true in deede, may I trust thee of thy woorde? Â«CÂ»ondi. If you take mee with a lie, thrust me through with your sworde. Â«LÂ»eostines. If all be true in deede, and if thou doest not fayne, Be sure for thy courtesie wee will reward thee with gayne. But what is thy name I pray thee confesse? Â«CÂ»ondi. Grauitie noble Lorde, the truth to expresse. LeostineÂ«s.Â» Grauetie? thou art welcome to our court, to remaine, Condi. Ha I am the ancientest Gentilman yt euer you did entertaine. LeostineÂ«s.Â» Come on my Lords wt me, with grauitie &amp; the foole in like case, For wee intend most secretly to her closet dore for to trace. To see if it be true, the which they haue confest. All. To waight on your honour, wee all are here prest. Exeunt. Condit. Ha my good Master Lamphedon and Clarisia in like sort, Fortune hath not permitted that longer time you twain shuld sport would it not greeue you wiues to se your husbands com from ye seas And cannot haue half a nights lodging but eueri man must him disease But disease or disease not, if I were in his case, At the first I would euen to the bed, and vpon her apace. For it tis my vse if I be a bed with a woman I take no care, Untill all the Constabels in the towne at my bed side are. Soft, they are comming, alas good louers, you are at a mad staye, For why, Leostines he doth intend to worke your decay. The best is not for me to stay their comming into place. Least I bee taken with a lie which would my doyngs deface. By your leaue, no more a sayler will I bee, But straight will I disguise my self to both parties you shall see. Here entreth Leostines, two Lordes, leadinge Lamphedon, and Clarisia. Leostines Come Sirs, and bryng away those captiues with speede, For why, to worke their finall end I fully am decreede. Ha wretchlesse dame that thus wouldst seeme for to abuse thy state To feede thy filthy fonde desier, in sutch a kinde of rate. Did I immagine day and night thee highly to exalt, And couldest thou seeme thus fainedly on bothe sides for to halt, Is this thy virgins state, thou wretche, which so thou diÂ«dÂ»st desier? Is Â«thisÂ» thy holly sacred life, which oft thou didst requier? Ha carelesse dame, assuer thy self without any further pawse, Thou shalt with this thy louer here according to our lawes Sustaine the doome, the which you ment for to bestow on mee, That is, for your accursed crime you bothe shall poysoned bee. And yt the same be straight brought in my lordes I giue you charge Straight to depart vnto our court &amp; to expresse at large To Grauitie, and will him straight to depart to our Phisicien, And bryng from thence the strongest poyson that is of many a one, Wherfore my lordes incontinent make all the hast you may. Â«BÂ»oth. Your highnes will O noble Lorde your seruants shall obay Leostines. Dispatche my Lords, for til they come wee shal abide them here. And caitif well assure thy self, thou shalt abie this deare. Lamphe. O Heauens, how cruelly deale you wt vs in changing our estate? How can you see the innocent to die in sutch a rate? Ha my deare lady, must thou sustaine the doome of death for mee? Must thou for no offence at all, through rankor poysoned bee? Must thou O Lady, end thy daies in sight of me thy freende? Nay first ye mightie powers aboue, voutchsafe my life to ende. Let not my carefull eyes, alas, in open wise remayne, Untill they se her, ha deare gods, thus end her daies through paine O noble lorde, on bended knees her life of thee I craue, Let me alone sustaine the death which sought the same to haue. Saue hir poore life to end all strife, thy mercie do ostende, Seme for to stay, make not away, that which neuer did offend. Tis I alone, O noble lorde that hath deserued the death. Clarisia. Ha, holde your peace, my louing lorde, in vaine you wast your breath Seeme not to craue thy death alone, my carefull life to saue. Sith thou must die, most glad am I, the selfe same death to haue. O noble lorde Leostines, and Maister in like case, Uoutchsafe to take some pittie here, and graunt to vs some grace. Saue here the life of man and wife, who neuer thought a misse. Towards your state, O worthy lorde assure your self of this. Although that foole doth seeme to faine with that Parasite also, Seeme not vpon their forged talke to end our dayes with wo, But graunt vnto thy seruants iust, due pardon noble lorde. Leostines. Leaue of thy suite, in vaine thou seekest to haue me to accorde. But that which you by law deserue, you surely both shall haue. Wherfore refraine, seeme not againe of mee the like to craue, But do prepare incontinent, and yeeld your selues to die. Lamphe. Then gods voutchsafe for to receaue our soules to heauens hie. Here entreth Condicions alone with a couered goblet. Condi. Ha the Gods preserue your state &amp; send your honour long to liue Your obedient seruant hath brought here ye poyson which you mind to giue, Unto Lamphedon, and lady Metrea shee. If it please you the Doctor saies tis the strongest yt can deuised bee. LeostineÂ«s.Â» Geue it me Lamphedon I charge thee to drinke first the same, Lamphe. Sith that it is but vayne resistance for to frame: Then my deare lady here is to thee in way of our last greetinge The powers vouchsafe yt in ye heauens we may haue ioyful meting Metrea. Ha my dere lord, sith needs thou must, thy loue shal folow straigt Leostines. Dispatch I say, make no delay, for long we may not waight. Lamphe.

Ha my deare parents now a dew &amp; eke eche faithfull freende Lamphedon hee, with his Lady shee, their youthful dayes must end. Farewell ye nobles all, farewell eche Marsiall knight, With whom within my fathers court I often did delight. And last of all farewel my deare, and faithful Lady true, Whose heapes of greif I do lament and lothsome state eke rue. And now farewell with last adue. Metrea. Ha my deare lorde, incontinent I minde thee to persue, Leostines. Well Lady now prepare your selfe of the like sauce to taste. Seeme not for to lament so longe the time away to waste. Wherfore dispatche, take the cup in hand, &amp; drinke you of the same. Metrea. Wo be to thee Leostines, yt wrongfully hast sought our deaths to frame Leostines. Wel wel dispatch &amp; make an end for time begins to vade. Metrea. Lo Leostines thou shalt not say I go about thee to perswade. Leostines. O stay thy hand, my Metrea deare, and I will saue thy life. Metrea. In faith sir knight you come to late to gaine her as your wife.</field>
