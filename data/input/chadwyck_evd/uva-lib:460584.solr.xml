      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Paris. A public place in the vicinity of the Palace. Fontaine, La Roche, and Tournet standing apart. Citizens, youths, and maidens dancing at back; occasional acclamations. 1st Cit. Long live King Philip! 2d Cit. And Queen Ingerburge! 1st Cit. I say, long live King Philip; and the Queen May live too—till she tires him! 3d Cit. Ill for her Had she wed thee on such conditions! 1st Cit. Truly, 'Twere ill for both had I wed her on any! Pardie, a white-faced Dane, with yellow— 2d Cit. Friend, Beware my cudgel! Faith, a likely knave To prate of a queen's hair! 1st Cit. Well, all I say, Poor lady, of her Danish face, is this— If her heart be not cold and sour, the wine They drink in Denmark must be very thin. 3d Cit. Not so is that which all to-day hath flowed Along our streets, in honour of her marriage. Pity a king can't marry every day! [Several Nobles pass through the crowd with a haughty carriage. 2d Cit. Hush, masters! doff your caps! Ay, there they go! Now there's a mouth would fall into a sneer, After the draining of a well-brimm'd cup. 1st Cit. Ay, Because the king forbids them hang their serfs For a morn's pastime, they grow sullen. Would They'd kindly feed our mirth that way themselves! 2d Cit. Always except the brave Fontaine, and those His loyal comrades of the household. See, He stands, a knightly pattern! 3d Cit. Well, let's on— Long live the King! 2d Cit. And Queen! 3d Cit. And song! 1st Cit. And dance! [They join the dancers in the background, and rush out with cheering and music. La Roche. Where fall thy musings? Tour. Faith, on loyalty. Fon. Now, what is loyalty? Tour. Once in an age, A people's echoed love; oft but a vent For the national superfluity of sound. The essence of this ardour towards the king Is his despite to us. La Roche. Ay, the appeal He gave our vassals from us to himself. One may not scourge, or chain, or hang one's serfs Without the king's good pleasure. That's to rate A peasant's life as richly as a noble's. Our cattle soon shall have their justice-halls, And fine the herdsman for his blows! Tour. Fontaine, Shall we thus tamely yield our rights and honours? Thy kinsman rose 'gainst this unnatural wrong! Fon. And lost his head. You see, I'm tame. Tour. Thou art! Fon. Had I been king, he should have lost his head. Power, when assail'd, must sternly strike or die. La Roche. Dost praise the king? Fon. Yes. Tour. Dost forgive him? Fon. No. Yet do I hate him not; but must wipe out By my necessity the stain wherewith His own necessity disgraced my house. Besides he hath despoiled us of our rights— Perilled our very order; and my aim Slackens no whit, under this guise of love, To work his downfall. Still I like the man— I like him for a foe. Though wily, brave, And bounteous like heaven. Tour. Ay, sir, to those Who rate him as a god; but cross his pride— Fon. And he's a demon. So the brightest torch Flings deadliest glare on the opposing wind. Let's own the quarry noble that we fly at— I would he had not slain my kinsman, though. Tour. What must be done? Fon. Nothing. La Roche. Nothing? Be sure Much always hides in Fontaine's nothings. Fon. Friends! The king—just wed with Ingerburge—has girt His throne with a new bulwark, Denmark's aid. His foes abroad put up their half-drawn swords, And wait their season: we must do the same. La Roche. A bitter physic for his kingdom's ills, Finds Philip in his wife! Tour. 'Twas a strange union; No note of preparation. In one week They were betrothed and wed! La Roche. Fontaine, didst mark His bearing at the altar? Fon. It scarce spoke The bridegroom an idolater. La Roche. The lady, Thou knowest, was his kinswoman. That staled him. Fon. His kinswoman! Ay! near? La Roche. So near, indeed, That your wits jest and cynics frown distaste. Tour. They are so close akin, 'tis said their marriage Borders upon offence to Holy Church. Fon. Borders upon it? Tour. One or two degrees Had made the bond unlawful. Fon. Good! degrees Are what construction makes them, and construction Is a most pliant servant to the will. Borders? humph! La Roche. Speak! Fon. Don't shake the vat wherein The liquor should ferment. I will— Tour. What? Fon. Join These loyal revellers. Citizens and others re-enter. Saints, what an eye That dancing nymph hath! ankles, too, that gleam Like two mad stars at play! Tour. And can thy brain Stoop to these follies? La Roche. 'Tis his whim. Fon. Sage Tournet! Thy moody face too well reports thy heart. Jovial La Roche! thy wits too oft escape Through that wide, ever-open gate—thy mouth. And so I quit ye both. Why, life's a game Whose zest's variety! Plots, festivals, Rose-wreaths and lances, council-chambers, bowers Alternate bravely. Nay, look, what an ankle! [He breaks from them, and joins the throng in the background. SCENE II. An apartment in the Palace. Enter Philip, Ingerburge, Guérin. Guér. Your royal consort, sire, has cause for speech. Forgive me if, as priest still more than knight, I here uphold her claims. Ing. Sir! if in aught I have displeased you, name my sin. If not, Use me as innocent, and as your wife. Phil. What lacks your grace? A larger retinue? More liberal pomps or pleasures? They are yours, Though our exchequer fail. Ing. These are my due: Yet, more—your countenance, society, Public respect. Why do you shun my sight, And make my lofty station void of honour? Courts quickly learn to slight whom kings despise. Phil. Whate'er was mine to give is yours already. We cannot take hearts in our hands and give them. Ing. Yours is not mine then? Phil. Did you give me yours? Ing. I claim at least the decent shows of honour. Nor is King Canute's sister so unfriended That she should brook contempt of just demands. Sir! see my ladies wait. [To Guérin. She makes a profound reverence, and quits the apartment. Phil. Claim, said she? Claim! For this cold prudence whose ambition, even, Voyages by map, not starlight—have I thee For ever lost, my Marie? To this ruin Thou didst persuade me, Guérin! Guér. By your marriage, Austria and Flanders, who, with English John, Stand leagued against your peace, are held in awe; So, too, your disaffected nobles here. Phil. Ay, true. The crafty Canute saw my strait, And that crown'd usurer proffer'd Denmark's aid Provided Philip made his sister queen! Guér. The Lady Ingerburge is now your wife. Brood on the past no more; improve the present! Phil. Cold-hearted priest! That past enfolds a Marie. She was my chosen: we were wed in heart. [Aside.] Marie, thou know'st not yet thy wrong; thou know'st not Thy Philip perjured; but confiding still, Still loving, dost await him. Guér. Sire, bethink you, Monarchs are born for thousands, not for one; For duties, not affections. Phil. Ay, wise craft! With kings 'tis war with Nature from their birth. Cold form sits by their cradles; childhood's trust And impulse curbed, a boy-prince rarely knows Boy-fellowship, nor princely youth a friend. And when, surviving still, the sense he drew From heaven of beauty doth expand to love Of some bright form of goodness; when he yearns In honour of the worshipped one to rear That stateliest column, a great life! when most He feels his Nature's grandeur, strength, and joy, A courtly custom intercepts his path To the bright goal—love was not made for kings! Guér. Great ones must crush their hearts to pave their power. Phil. 'Tis false; the crushed heart's powerless. Stifling that, We stifle ardour, hope, and enterprise; And what God means for man dwarfs to a form, A feeble puppet with a golden rim, That doses life away, and dies unmissed! Enter Fontaine. How, sir! We're private! Fon. Pardon, sire! methought I had your gracious privilege—if not, My tidings might atone me. Phil. Leave us, Guérin, Bear with thy master, Stephen. [Apart to him, and taking his hand. Guérin goes out. Well, speak on! Fon. The insurgent nobles in the south submit Unto your grace's arms, which news to crown, From Otho—late your foe—have envoys sped To hail you on your nuptials. Phil. [Bitterly.] To the queen! The might of Denmark quells these foes, extorts These novel courtesies. Think'st thou not so? Fon. From your own seed hath sprung this harvest, sire! The glorious issue of his acts whose fame Unwearied echo sounds, and to whose robe Cling widowed majesty and orphan right; Whose very wards are monarchs! Phil. Bid them fling A cushion for me to the foot of the throne! Is't meet that I should sit with her who gave it? Well, friend? That glance has meaning; speak your thought. Fon. Ah, my liege, pardon me, and bear with her! I grieve 'tis noted that division lives Between your princely hearts;—but I presume. Phil. Of all men have we singled thee for love. Fear not. Fon. Then till you chide I speak. Your consort holds A double claim on duty; first, as queen, Then as your kinswoman. O sir, 'twere well Those slanderous tongues were checked which dare impeach Her title to that name you deigned confer. Phil. Ah! what name? Fon. Wife, my liege. Phil. Wife! say you, wife? They question that? Fon. Pretending, sir, that bonds Of such close kinship knit you, ere you wed, That marriage did invade their sanctity. Phil. Is't said so! Dare they. Enter Tournet and La Roche. Fon. Here come two, my lord, Whose swords, incensed by men's audacious jests, Have blushed to keep their sheaths. Phil. Can I believe Licence has grown so bold? Fon. As though a king Were bound within the limits priests prescribe The commonalty. Phil. What! you have heard this marriage Laughed at, discussed, reproved? [To Tournet and La Roche. Tour. [Apart to La Roche.] What shall we say? La Roche. Oh, travel by the light of Fontaine's eye. Fon. Forgive them, sire, if awe restrain their tongues. Friends, witness for me that my words are true! Phil. Speak frankly all. La Roche. In every point, my lord, Must I confirm the words of brave Fontaine. Tour. So humbly I repeat, can I with grief That reverence for your grace forbade my hand To smite the scoffers. Phil. [Sternly.] Well, you did refrain! Judge not in the king's quarrel, nor revile Those whom you count his foes, more kin perchance Than meddlers, to his pleasure. Sirs, retire! [Tournet and La Roche go out. Fontaine, we need thee still. We'll breathe the air. Walk by our side. We rate thee highly, friend; And honour thee with fullest trust. [Extends his hand to him. Fon. [Kneeling.] Your grace Is rich in bounty and in confidence To your poor vassal; [Aside.] tendering him this hand Red with a brother's blood! [Fontaine rises; Philip motions him to follow. Fon. [Bowing deeply.] Sire, I attend you. [The King goes out, followed by Fontaine. SCENE III. Gardens adjoining the Château of Marie de Méranie, some leagues from Paris. The garden is laid out in grass plots, bordered with trees. Rustic seats are placed here and there. Entrance to Château, which is visible at side. Enter Adolphe, Cécile, and other retainers of Marie de Méranie's household, including women and children. They sing as they enter. Song. To our noble lady hail! Now from every hill and vale Let our prayers and praises sound; Be her years with blessings crowned, All earth's choicest gifts attend her, All Heaven's gracious powers befriend her. Adolphe. [To the rest.] Now for a dance, a blithe dance; let the foot Bound lightly to the pulses of the heart, For 'tis our lady's birthday. Cécile. Brightest fête Of all we keep; to-day the Princess Marie, So loved by all, so well deserving love, Attains her twentieth birthday. Adolphe. Her first birthday Since she left Méranie; the duke, her father, Desired that she should learn the life of courts In polished France, and at King Philip's prayer Did send her hither. Cécile. Ah! life's gay enough When she's at court; but this, her country home, Where no news travels, six long leagues from Paris, Is dull as gaol or convent. Adolphe. We'd make merry Even in gaol upon her birthday. Many Voices. Ay! Adolphe. 'Twould be no gaol if she were there. The dance! Your hand, Cécile! [A rustic dance, in which all join. Adolphe. See, see, the princess comes! Enter Marie de Méranie, attended by Anne de Vignolles. All. Long live the princess! Cécile. Long live the Lady Marie! Now, Elise! [Elise, a child, led by Cécile, advances from the group, kneels, and presents flowers to Marie. Marie. [Graciously receiving them, and embracing Elise.] Thanks, thanks, my sweet Elise; Thanks, thanks, kind friends; This is a happy birthday. She, indeed, Has right to count it such who year by year Finds old friends still more loving, and new friends To ripen into old ones. Follow now The Lady Anne. There is a feast prepared; And ere you quit the board, myself will join you. Conduct them, Anne; you too, Adolphe, go with them. [She makes a gracious inclination, which the group answer with obeisances, and retire into the Château, conducted by Anne and Adolphe. As they retire, they resume the song with which the scene opens. Marie. [Who has sunk into a rustic chair.] A happy birthday! Ay, the happiest! Past years seemed bright; but oh! how wan appears Their brightness set by this; just as, at eve, The early stars seem bright, until the moon, Like a new birth in heaven, breaks forth and drowns them. So my past joys fade in a rarer bliss— A bliss so pure, I scarce dare whisper it— I love and I am loved! Am I not, Philip? [Draws a letter from her bosom. Here are thy words. [Reads.] “Marie, my life, having thee, I were earth's richest man; earth's poorest man, Having earth itself without thee. Doubt me not, Though I delay. The acts of kings must wait On policy, and on their people's need. Yet, sure as rivers, howsoe'er they wind, Tend to the sea, my love shall find thee out, And claim thee of thy father; doubt me not!” Doubt thee? Not while thy Marie is thy Marie! [She sits absorbed, her eyes riveted on the letter. Re-enter Anne. Anne. [Aside, observing her.] Still wrapt in dreams—in happy dreams of love, Hid in joy's very core, as is a bee In a rose's heart. O cruel task to wake her! Yet she must wake. 'Tis months now since King Philip Pledged her that love which she has secret held From all but me. He vowed ere many days To ask her of her father, but forbears To claim his prize. One letter, which she wears And hoards as 'twere some life-protecting charm, Is all since then that she has heard of Philip. [Marie turns and sees Anne; then, as if waking from reverie, replaces letter in her bosom. Marie. So, Anne; how goes the feast? Anne. O, gaily, madam! On this your birthday every face puts on Its happiest smile. Marie. Except, dear Anne, thine own. How comes it that to-day thy lively wit Deserts thee, and thy clear, smooth brow grows clouded? Anne. Is it so, madam? Marie. [Taking her hand playfully.] Ah! I guess the cause: Our knight, Sir Lucien, stays too long in Paris. Thou'dst have him home? Anne. Have Lucien home? for what? To tire my eyes by day with love-sick looks, And break my rest at night with serenades! Marie. Perverse one! Hide thy secret from thy friend, Who tells thee all? Thou long'st for his return. Yet, faith, scarce more than I. He may bring tidings— Thou know'st of whom? Anne. You mean he may bring tidings From Paris of the king. Marie. He may. Anne. [Aside.] Fond heart, That harbours not a doubt; so unprepared For the stern blow I dread! [Aloud.] Dear mistress, He may, indeed, bear tidings of the king; But is't not strange?— [Hesitates. Marie. Go on. Anne. That months should pass With no word from the king—no little message Or sign of memory? Marie. [Smiling.] Dost thou doubt him, Anne? Anne. Dost thou ne'er doubt? Marie. I love; love cannot doubt. Anne. His silence and his absence then— Marie. Are tests That prove my faith. What! Think'st thou, when this king— The pride of Europe, Champion of the Cross, The serf's deliverer, the people's friend— Deigned proffer of his love to one like me, I should requite his love with base suspicion? He pledged me in himself the sum of all That man could give. Shall I not give him trust? Anne. Heaven make him worthy of it. You might choose Less grandeur with more peace. Report gives out This king for stern and crafty— Marie. Envy still Defames the life above it— Anne. And, at least, The king's not young. Marie. The great are ever young. Anne. [With a sad smile.] We make things as we will them. [Breaking off.] Hush! a voice. Sir L. [Without.] My lady here, you say? Marie. [To Anne.] Ay, and a step! And by that blush thou knowest whose. 'Tis Lucien. Enter Sir Lucien. Said I not so?—You're welcome, friend; we long Have looked for your return. What news from Court? Sir L. Events both strange and sudden, gracious lady. I come from Amiens, where three days since The city, dressed in banners, with a shout Of mingling bells, that pealed from dawn to midnight, Proclaimed the royal marriage. Marie. [With unsuspecting interest.] Royal marriage! Who were the bride and bridegroom? Came the king there? Sir L. [Surprised.] How, madam! Marie. Came the king there? Sir L. Surely, princess. Methought I told you that the king himself Was married three days since at Amiens. Anne. [Aside.] Worse than I feared! Rash blunderer! [Apart to him.] Hold, Sir Lucien! Marie. Married! The king! What king? Sir L. King Philip, please you, To Princess Ingerburge, great Denmark's sister. Marie. [After a pause, mastering her emotion by a great effort.] You know this—saw it. 'Tis not mere report? Sir L. I know and saw it, madam. Marie. [Forcing a smile.] So 'twas sudden. Sir L. Twas most unlooked for. Marie. And the bride, you say— Sir L. Is Princess Ingerburge. Marie. A gracious lady, As I have heard. We'll not detain you, Lucien. Some other time we'll ask you of the pageant. [Sir Lucien bows, and goes out. Anne. Sweet mistress: she is tranced. O, speak to me! [After a pause.] Break, break this silence. Marie. [Rousing herself.] Anne? Anne. Your faithful friend, Who knows your grief. Marie. Then, if thou know'st it, speak not. Anne. Shame on this forsworn king, this recreant knight! Marie. Is this thy comfort?—Peace! Anne. Thy trust in him Was thy soul's life, and he has slain it! Marie. Then, Respect the dead, and leave it to its silence. [Anne is about to speak.] I'd be alone; retire. [Anne, anxiously observing her, withdraws to back, but still remains on the scene. Marie. [After a long pause.] Dead! Would it were—this heart that he has crushed! But ah! though crushed, it beats, and must writhe on, Trailing a wounded life out. Philip false! Do I so brand him?—I who, on his breast, Have drunk his vows, and from one smile have spun A life's whole sunshine—I who, had one said But yesterday—O Heaven! how many lives Is yesterday from this! He has been tempted, Driven to this marriage. Some stern need of State Has forced him on, while his resisting heart Still yearned to Marie. 'Twere a keener pang To think him faithless than to know him lost, Though lost for ever. Lost! in that one word My life is henceforth written. Lost! still lost! [She totters forward. Anne, who has observed her emotion, hastens to support her. Anne. Sweet lady, gentle friend, 'tis I! Marie. [Falling on Anne's neck with a cry.] Anne, Anne! [As Anne supports her, and slowly leads her out, the drop-curtain falls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Palace. An ante-room leading to the Council Chamber. Fontaine, Tournet, and La Roche. Nobles and others occasionally pass across the stage at the back. Fon. [Bringing Tournet and La Roche forward.] See, they go in to council! Not so loud. La Roche. And so from that poor hint, that casual breath, Thy art is like to work the queen's divorce! Fon. Ay, if the council be but the king's clerk, Crying amen to what he prays for. Tour. Count not on that. The Churchmen whose advice Is like to sway the synod may not strain The law to such extremes. Divorce the queen Because she was akin to Philip's wife, Betrothed in boyhood! Thou dost prop our hope On basement fine and frail as spider's line. Fon. A most substantial bridge—that spider's line. The iron wills all earth can scarce roll on, Are zephyrs when themselves elect to move. Our spider's line will do. The queen's divorce The king wills, and the bishops will to please The king's will, save the reverend Lord of Paris, whom The rest must overrule. Tour. I doubt the issue. Fon. Sir, the king's hate is threefold; in it blend Jealousy of the Dane, disrelish fixed Of Ingerburge, which she by threats and coldness Has more inflamed, and passion for another. La Roche. How will this serve us? Fon. How? Art thou a mole, That cannot see the daylight? Philip breaks His oath to Ingerburge, and lays his crown At Marie's feet. They wed. The incensed Dane, His sister thus disgraced, withdraws his aids; Nay, turns them to offence! John, Otho—seize The auspicious hour! The Pope has been o'erlooked By these impatient prelates. Ingerburge Appeals to Rome. Rome, glad to arbitrate In royal feuds, her quarrel doth espouse. The Pope is Philip's foe. What penal fires Sleep in those words!—what crushing consequence! Then is our time for action and revenge. Then slaughtered kinsman, then dishonoured line, Your retribution quickens! Well, Sir Mole, Dost thou yet see? La Roche. I see. Fon. The council waits. Come, come, the game proceeds! Craft matched with craft! O conflict nobler far than sword with sword! [They go out. SCENE II. The Council Chamber. Philip on the throne. Guérin; Archbishop of Rheims; Bishop of Paris and other Bishops; Tournet, La Roche, Fontaine; other Nobles, Officers, &amp;c. &amp;c. Guér. My gracious lord! As counsellor, priest, soldier, friend, and man, Do I abjure this deed. 'Twill shake your throne, Stain your religion, blot your knighthood. What! On this unheard-of cause ere scarce the sounds Of marriage-bells have ceased—divorce your queen! Sire, hear your servant! Phil. Guérin! Not with us These issues rest. The king is passive here, Waits sentence, doth not give it; but obeys In all the synod's voice. Fon. [Aside.] Apt policy! On others lights the odium whom his will Governs unseen. Great king! Guér. I turn to you Whose mitred heads pledge justice. Sanction you The queen's dismissal from his grace's arms? Will you confirm a deed whose startling shame Grows ranker if you gloss it; a vile deed In all its aspects, unredeemed by pleas Of precedent, necessity, or gain; A deed whose nature but one question bears— Whether its madness or its sin exceed? B. of Paris. I think with you. Yet must our private wills Yield to the force of numbers. Guér. Not when numbers Would counsel majesty to fraud and wrong. A. of Rheims. My lord, this vehemence denies respect Unto the general voice o'erruling yours. Phil. Kind father! deem not harshly of his zeal; None hold we dearer. Fon. [Aside.] A sagacious prince! Arch. Reason is oftener the will's instrument Than ruler. It doth gloss the act we wish, But ne'er persuade to undesired conclusions. Therefore, from argument I little hope. I hold the marriage void, and shall record My oath so in due time. B. of Paris. [Coldly.] I yield submission To your more reverend wisdom. Arch. Then why tarry? We with our holy brethren have conferred And are as one agreed. Enter Officer. Officer. In Denmark's name, Ambassadors crave audience. Phil. Shoals so near port! [Aside. In very season! Straight conduct them hither. Enter Briorn, the Danish envoy, and others, preceded by a Herald. Speak; your lord's errand, Briorn! [Herald sounds his trumpet. Bri. Denmark's king Greets thee, King Philip, with accustomed love, No credence deigning to the fame that tells Thou wouldst divorce and shame his royal sister. Phil. How if this fame speak truth? Bri. Then princely Canute Recalls his succours, and disowns his pact, Holds thee, till death, worse foe than Death himself, And bids thee know he hath appealed to Rome, Whose mandate, disallowing thy intent, I but some hours outspeed. Guér. Thank Heaven! the Pope From this black deed shall save us! B. of Paris. [To the Bishops.] Rome! methinks, 'Twere best deliberate. Her supremacy We peril by this act. Phil. Wavering! [Aside. To Briorn.] Return! Tell Canute, who would play upon our fear With Rome's dread wrath, our cause already seeks Judgment from Rome's sworn ministers—our bishops; Who, though we may augment, reduce, or wrest From them entire rank, profit, and revenue, As vagrant friars would rather beg than sell Their conscience for reward. Fon. Sagacious prince! Most aptly put; their all depends on him. [Aside. Arch. [To Bishop of Paris.] We do but ill to dread the morrow's storm When the fire-gendering cloud o'erhangs our heads, The king's displeasure! [Other Bishops signify assent. B. of Paris. Even as you will. Lay not this servile weakness to my charge. Arch. This embassy, that threats the Pontiff's wrath, Bears no credentials from him. We maintain Our purpose here. [To Briorn. Guér. Oh madness—infamy! Defy the Pope? Our buckler cast away— The Dane's alliance? while on every side Foes draw their arrows headward! Rome, insulted, Applauds each shaft, and lends her arm to crush! O valiant nobles! save us from this doom.— I see you heed. Tour. [Apart to Fontaine.] By heaven, they quail! Our stake Is one with Philip's. We shall lose. Fon. [Apart to Tournet and La Roche.] Mark, mark! His brows contract and ope: his hands unite, And straight unclench; the torrent bursts. I said it. Phil. No word to sway your sentence; but, brave lords, Let not the menaced loss of foreign aid Weigh on your thought unduly! I was wrong To trust this land's defence to alien hands. 'Tis in itself a State is strong. No foe Can sap such strength; no friend its want repair. O grey-haired warriors, who fight again Your battles, in the young your memories fire, And ye, of their renown the heirs, who burn Their great bequest—undimmed to leave your sons, Witness how legions fled your lonely brands; Conquest is child of hearts that trust themselves! So with a State. 'Tis that life-blood called faith— Faith in itself—that floods its frame with might! No hireling arm for us! Our own we raise In our own war. [Rises.] Wake, France, thy crutches fall; Thou towerest singly in thine inborn health, Match for the banded world's dependencies! Whose bosom echoes mine? Fon. Long live the king! Nobles. Long live the king! Long live the king! Phil. Pronounce Sentence! Arch. The queen's divorce. [Chorus of Nobles and Bishops. Phil. Break up the council. This sentence, Briorn, to thy lord report. On, sirs! [The King goes out, followed by Bishops and Nobles. Guér. [Aside.] The seeds are madness—death the fruit! Fon. [To La Roche and Tournet.] Brave, brave! how zealously he fought for ruin! His brain an engine turned against himself. Our swords may rest. We need not strike to win. [All go out. SCENE III. Apartment in the Chateau of Marie de Méranie. Enter Sir Lucien and Anne. Sir L. Nay, trust me; change so sudden and extreme Springs not from light occasion! She—a lady Of charity, more prompt than need was urgent; So patient, kind, serene—observe her now: Imperious oft, secluded, well-nigh stern; Capricious, fitful, motiveless in mirth! Anne. Why, that's to say she's woman. Women change Sea-like, to show their rich variety. To-day there's scarce a ripple, and to-morrow The waves are mountains. Now they're sober grey; Now brightly blue, they laugh and chase each other; Now, a black, moving wall, they crash in thunder. Sweet saints, how stale that man or woman were Who could not change. I've known such. Sir L. You evade me. Some cruel stroke of fate has thus transformed her. It may be loss of friends, or trust betrayed, Or hopeless love. Anne. Or it may be the toothache. Hopeless love! Good! [With laughter. Sir L. You jest, not knowing love. Anne. Prythee, set not Thyself to teach me. Sir L. Why not? Anne. Why not, Wisdom? Because to me love means a smiling face, While thine is rueful,—the brave march of life To clashing cymbals or the ring of steel, While thou dost drone on lute and mope in chambers. Why, thou wouldst woo in sermons, wed in black, And celebrate thy marriage by a fast! Nay, lay aside the sword and don the cowl; 'Tis sad the Church should lack one skilled like thee In framing homilies! Sir L. They shall not tire you. [Aside.] Anne has no heart. 'Tis pity she is fair; More pity I should know it. [He bows coldly, and goes out. Anne. He would pierce The silent mystery of the heart she shrouds, Or would shroud, from my love, and then, perchance, As he hath caught the minstrel's craft, regale The ears of languid knights and curious squires With my dear lady's story. Ah! she comes. Enter Marie. Anne. [Aside, regarding her.] Beneath pride's robe grief hides its throbs in vain: The fluttering folds betray the heart beneath. Marie. [Suddenly turning and observing her.] Well, mistress! What offence? Anne. Madam! Offence? Marie. Ay; where's the flaw? Where fails my tire-woman? See'st thou my robe awry, or hair unbound? From head to foot, where's my defect? Anne. Indeed, I mark none, madam. Marie. What has made me, then, So curious in your sight—Lucien's and yours? Why meet and follow me your constant eyes? My face is not a dial. If it were, It lacks the sunshine! Anne. They who seek its face In sunshine—use the dial; but who bends O'er it in cloudy hours is won to gaze By gratitude alone. Marie. [Sitting.] A fair conceit! My footstool! And who taught my joyous Anne These grave moralities? Be blithe, my girl! Thought comes with sorrow; sorrow comes with years. Alas! sometimes with few. For me, I'm vowed To mirth so deeply, no calamity Shall e'er make me less happy than I am. Enter Sir Lucien, hastily. Sir L. News, Lady Anne! The king— Marie. The king! Well, sir? Sir L. Madam, 'tis said between his majesty And his new queen such difference hath grown As rends the solemn ties that lately bound them. 'Tis rumoured that their marriage is annulled By order of the Council; on what ground I know not yet. Marie. On any, friend; for power Is its own argument. Unhappy lady! My heart bleeds for thee. [Aside.] Lucien, thou hast found Our hall too like a prison. Forth and join The city's pageant. Sir L. Ah! the day is lost That sees me from your service. Marie. Thanks! But go. So wilt thou serve me. 'Tis my wish. [Sir Lucien goes out. He's gone! I have a partner in calamity In this wronged queen. I could not weep till now! [Falling on Anne's neck. Anne. 'Tis strange I should be glad to see thee weep; And yet I am. Marie. The bitterness is past. I've too much strained thy patience. Thou'lt forgive me? To-morrow we return to Méranie; And there, if Marie midst her sire's dependants Their humble lot may cheer, their burthens ease, Her life may yet have use. What mean those sounds? [Trumpets heard without. Re-enter Sir Lucien, followed by the King. Sir L. Madam, the king craves audience. Phil. Whose the lip But his to ask that boon? Marie! Marie. Your grace! Wherefore?—Nay, sir, 'tis granted.—Friends, retire. [Sir Lucien and Anne go out. Phil. How poor are thanks for payment. Thou wilt hear, Perchance—oh! dare I hope it—pity? Marie. Both. If you endure a grief unmerited, I pity much; and if deserved, still more. Phil. Severer than rebuke is this forbearance. Goes thy heart with it? Marie. Comprehend me, sir. I do not feign that you have used me well, Or that I have not suffered. But the wrong Heaven strengthened me to bear, it bids me pardon. As these are parting words, believe their truth. Phil. Speak'st thou of parting? Marie. To my father's land The morrow lights me. Phil. Sooner be it quenched! I come to atone the madness which awhile Shut out thine image. To the throne of France I bear thee. There no haughty rival towers: Her chains are rent! Marie. [Sternly.] How rent? Phil. She stands divorced. Marie. And thou hast done this! King, one woman's heart Glows not with triumph at another's fall; But shivers 'neath the warmest robe of love Rent from a sister freezing in her woe, And naked to the insult of the world! Phil. She loves me not; our differing wills recoil. A grant in land to compensate her dower Will medicine all her grief. Besides, in this, I but obey the Church. Say, can thy voice Cancel our prelates' judgment, or recal Whom they have exiled? No; on me alone Thy vengeance falls. Alas! I have deserved Thou shouldst forget or scorn me. Marie. I forget! I scorn, whose memory has no other wealth Than those blest hours which, diving in the past, She bears me back—dear relics of Hope's wreck! [Aside. I scorn! No, Philip! It will make my pulse Beat quicker in its silence, when I hear That you are happy; and should perils come, The faltering prayer your ear will never know, May yet reach Heaven's. And so we do not part In anger. From my inmost heart I bless you! Phil. What words are these that bless me in their sound, And curse me in their sense? O Marie, hear me! Thy love is not alone my fortune's crown; 'Tis Nature's need! not to my branch of life An added blossom, but the vital essence Replenishing the root! You changed my being! I measured glory once by daring deeds, Extended empire and prostrate foes. You taught me, first, to think Deliverer A holier name than Victor; that the rod Of terror rules but shrinking clay, while love Sits throned in living hearts! I thought of thee, And from the captive dropped his chain; of thee, And pardoned, rose the traitor at my feet; Of thee, and bade the tyrant-stricken serf Look up, and greet a father in his king! O saint of mercy, I have built thee shrines By happy hearths through France! It is thy life That thrills in every pulse, thy soul that floods Each artery of my own! Each thought of good Is but thyself reflected! Spurn not, crush not, That which thou didst create! [Sinking on his knee. Marie. [Aside.] My feet are fixed. I would depart, but cannot. Phil. [Rising.] Listen, heed! Thou seest me contrite, pardon; weak, sustain; Erring, direct me! Snatch me from the toils Of selfish brains, the chill of frigid hearts, The infected air that stifles and corrupts The soul that pants to live! Unpitying still, Still silent! Then farewell; but when the years Of woe unshared, of struggles with the base Who taint even what resists them, aims unguided, Have frozen impulse into apathy, Mercy to rigour; when the man, whom once You might have raised, bless'd, saved, becomes—Well, well, Whate'er I may become, think what I was, And what I might have been had Marie loved me! Marie. Had Marie loved thee? Phil. And I dreamed she did. Marie. O Philip! I am thine. [Throwing herself into his arms. Phil. Mine! 'tis a sound I could repeat for ever. Mine, mine, mine!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A public place in the neighbourhood of the Palace. Groups of Citizens and others, including women and children. 1st Cit. This way he passes. 3d Cit. Who? the king? 2d Cit. To-day, The king; to-morrow, what the Pope thinks fit. 4th Cit. [Who has recently entered.] 'Tis true: he meets the legate's threat with scorn, Mocks holy counsel! 2d Cit. And upon us all Draws the dread curse of Rome. 3d Cit. Ay, sirs, ourselves! There lies the point. 1st Cit. We're cursed because the king, For love of Lady Marie, his new queen, Resists the Church's will, and takes not back His lawful wife. Many voices. Most true; we are, we are! Enter Fontaine, Tournet, and La Roche. Tour. What mutter these base knaves? La Roche. Their highnesses Seem anger'd with the king. Fon. [Turning to the crowd.] Impossible! The king who freed the serfs, abased the nobles! Ye're not such ingrates! 2d Cit. 'Tis my thought he freed The serf from other tyrants, that himself Might bear the rod alone. 3d Cit. [To Fontaine.] Say, knightly sir, How shall we 'scape the interdict? What means it? Fon. More woes than tongue can speak or reason bear. The pair who love, no pious rites shall join; The penitent, no absolution find; The living, no religious office bless; The dead, no consecrated earth receive; The purgatorial fire, no prayers nor alms Avert or shorten! But your loyalty These ills affright not? 3d Cit. Shall we bear the doom This impious king provokes? 1st Cit. We'll not endure it. We'll cross his path, and tell him so! The Crowd. Ay, tell him! 2d Cit. [To 1st Citizen.] Thou shalt be spokesman, brother! See, he comes! 1st Cit. Pardie! 'Tis later than I thought. That dial— La Roche. Let him not hence. Thou'lt gain promotion, friend! 3d Cit. They're here. Enter Philip and Guérin, preceded and followed by Retainers. Budge not, stand thus [Folding his arms]; none doff his cap. Come forth; give thy lung play. [To 1st Citizen, whom he drags to the front. Cries of “Long live Queen Ingerburge!” An Officer. Back, sirs! The king. Back, citizens, I say! Phil. Why halt we? How! Hew us a pathway through these brambles, straight. [Officers drive back the crowd. 1st Cit. Back, back! [The King, Guérin, and retainers pass out. I kept my cap on though he frowned. 2d Cit. We are too few; let each man seek his friend, And his friend's friend; which done, let all assemble Before the palace. [Citizens rush out. Fon. Long ere then the knell Ye dread to hear shall boom along your streets. I marked the legate's face this morn. 'Twas calm After he left the king. Beware such calm! [Fontaine, Tournet, and La Roche go out on the opposite side. SCENE II. An apartment in the Palace. An oratory, with crucifix at back. Marie, engaged on embroidery, Anne, Sir Lucien. Sir Lucien sings, playing an accompaniment on his lute, the last notes of which are heard as the scene opens. Marie. Thanks, thanks, good Lucien; break off to-day, To-morrow thou shalt end the poet's tale. In truth, a moving lay! What think'st thou, Anne? [Smiling. Anne. I may not contradict your grace. Marie. Dissembler, Thou may'st, and oft thou dost. Come, come, your judgment! Anne. These love-tales tire me. I like not minstrels. Marie. Thou art most thankless, then; is she not, Lucien? Sir L. Truly, I think so, madam; for the minstrel Makes woman's beauty known, and sings the deeds Her love inspires. Anne. A woman knows her beauty well enough Without a minstrel, and would have deeds, Not songs, to celebrate it. Sir L. [Aside.] Does she taunt me? [Bows, and turns away. Marie. [Apart to Anne.] Your jests offend him. Anne. [Apart to Marie.] Would that they could strike One spark of spirit from him! Marie. He is brave No less than gentle, trust me; do not gamble With love, for thou dost love, nor slight the chance Of joy like mine! Anne. Art thou so happy? Marie. Am I Philip's wife? Anne. Yet thou hast cares. Marie. True; for my sake the king Braves vengeful Denmark and imperious Rome, And oft I fear his love conceals from me Impending danger; yet this selfish heart Too oft forgets his danger in his love! [Tumult is heard without, and cries from crowd of “Long live Queen Ingerburge!” “Away with Marie!” What mean those angry shouts? Sir L. [Going to window and looking forth.] A clamorous mob, Frantic and desperate, has forced its way Even through the palace gates! Marie. Methought I caught My name! [Renewed cries from crowd of “Away with Marie!” “Dismissal!” “Banishment!”] It is so. Sir L. Heed not, royal lady, The fickle crowd. Marie. Sir, I must heed the crowd; For I am Queen of France, and they her children! Sir L. [From window.] The king's guard drives them back, and now the king Himself approaches. [Tumult and cries renewed without, but more distant. Marie. And they greet him thus! Come!—Till I clasp him once more in these arms, I shall not know him safe. Follow me! Follow! [She goes out, followed by Sir Lucien and Anne. Cries from the crowd, “Long live Queen Ingerburge!” Counter cries from guard, “In the king's name!” “Fall back, fall back!” As the guard drive back the crowd, the cries become fainter, and subside. Enter, on side opposite to that by which Marie left, Philip and Guérin. Guér. Still ran the cry—Long live Queen Ingerburge! Phil. [Throwing himself into a chair.] Queen!—dar'st thou with that title yoke her name! Speak! was she not divorced? Guér. The bishops own They did exceed their province to declare Your marriage void without assent of Rome. Phil. Let them own what they will—exhaust the breath In their confessions, they may after need To absolve less reverend sinners! They shall not Include me in their penitence. They've erred, They say. Sir, grant it. Shall they, then, Retrieve their errors at my cost? Go to! What they have done—is done; and if remorse Will goad them—let it goad! Guér. Alas! my lord, The Pope's authority o'errules their voice. Your banished wife commands he you restore. Obey, you're saved; refuse, the interdict. Phil. [To himself, walking apart.] Forsake thee, Marie! No, whate'er betide, To thee I cleave! My love—if prodigal, Unreasoning, wild—is sworn to thy defence. As I'm a knight, I'll shield thee, though I cope Alone with ruin! When this priestly wrath Has scathed me, when my knightly robes are doff'd For leper's sackcloth, and the potentate Dwarfs to the outcast, own that I was true!— [After a pause.] You wed a prince;—or, say, a princely heart, Not less thy portion, though thy rival shared My pomp and title. Is it heart for heart? Oh, couldst thou love the man, if lost the king, What blest deliverance.—Saints! I were no man, But recreant, to shame thee! Misery, To what perdition dost thou tempt the soul! She's here, and the fiend flies her; Enter Marie. Guérin withdraws to back. Wife! Marie. My Philip! At last thy Marie knows at what dear cost She bears that name of wife. The people rise, And bid thee cast her from thee. Phil. Do they so? Modest to ask no more! Marie. Methinks I'd bid Farewell to life this moment for thy sake; Too happy were my tomb a hidden stone In thy joy's fabric. Phil. Hear me, Marie! Witness All that confirms an oath— Marie. Thou shalt not swear. Love that needs oaths to bind it—is forsworn Before it takes them. Enter Usher. Usher. Good my lord, the Council Even now assemble. Phil. Wait without, and bid My train attend me. [Officer goes out.] Sweet, our conference Will be but brief; trust me, it bodes no evil. Nor priest nor the leagued crowns of Christendom Shall wrest thee from thy Philip. [Embracing her.] Fear not, Marie. Guér. [Aside.] Then all is lost! Phil. [Turning to Guérin.] Now, Guérin! Guér. Sire, I'll follow. [The King goes out. [Aside.] Fate's on the moment; there's one desperate hope. She, and she only, can save king and people! [Advancing to Marie.] Your grace! Marie. Why wait you, sir? Guér. I am not welcome, It seems; you hold me not your friend. Marie. My lord, The king's friend must be mine. Guér. 'Tis as the king's friend I dare to speak. Marie. [Sitting.] Speak on. Guér. 'Tis right you know What peril threats the king. Marie. I know already. Guér. Ay, but you know it vaguely, deem it distant; You think the cloud far off; 'tis black above you, And charged with ruin. Marie. Hold! had the king wished I should know more, he had told me more. Guér. The king Cannot to you speak of this peril. Marie. Why not? Guér. Because you cause it. Deign to hear a man Whose task is harder than his bent; your lord For you defies the Pope, neglects his summons, And braves his edict. Wherefore Rome at last Rises to punish. Ere 'tis night, her curse, Her awful curse, may sound, and France and Philip Be outcasts from heaven's grace and earth's communion. Marie. Oh, terrible! Yet thou art cruel, priest, To taunt me thus. Can I avert this doom? Guér. You can avert it. You can rescue France And him who rules France. You can save your lord— His power, his fame, his perilled soul. Marie. You mock me. How can I do this? Guér. 'Tis for you he madly Contends with Rome. Your fatal beauty absent, Your claim resigned, he were no longer tempted. Marie. What do you ask? Guér. Things hard but possible. Give place to Ingerburge, your lawful rival; Fly from the king; resign your name of wife. Marie. [Starting up.] Resign my name of wife! Lord Hospitaller, Turn to me. Dar'st thou—thou, a holy priest, Counsel a godless act? That name of wife I at the altar took; shall I forswear it? It made my lord's fate mine; shall I desert him In this dark hour? Of his free choice he gave it; Shall I fling back his gift? By law he gave it; And shall I brand the deed that made him mine As lawless shame? Good night. Guér. The name you bear The Church denies you. Yield it, and the king Is saved; refuse, you drag him to perdition. Choose! Marie. I—I— Guér. No other choice. [Kneeling.] Now, lady, pardon The king's friend, if your foe. Marie. Up, up, thy tongue Has sheathed its poison here! Thy very look Is deadly to me.—Stay, 'twas for my lord Thou wast so cruel. [She extends her hand to him.] I forgive thee. Go! [Guérin kisses her hand, and with a profound reverence goes out. Marie. Philip on ruin's brink, in peril both Of life and life to come, and I can save him! How? Wrench from him myself, the engrafted branch That springs from him, lives by him! And if I do, Will he not bleed? Yet if my noxious graft Infect his goodly stem, 'twere better severed And withered at his foot! O strife! when love Must stifle love's wild yearnings for love's sake. Heaven, through this blinding grief I grope my way, And call on thee for light! Save, save my Philip! [She totters to the crucifix in oratory and sinks on her knees in supplication. The scene closes. SCENE III. A corridor in the Palace, leading to grand staircase and Council Chamber. Enter Guérin, meeting Officers of the Guard. Guér. [To 1st Officer.] Stay, stay, sir; you're of the king's guard? 1st Officer. Even now, My lord, we're summoned to conduct his grace Unto the Council. Guér. The Pope's legate, then, Is here, and waits the king? 1st Officer. Not yet; indeed, 'Tis rumoured that his eminence denies His presence to the chamber. Guér. So! [Aside.] 'Tis like. [He bows; Officers bow in return, and go out. Refuse to meet the Council! Then the storm Will surely burst full soon. I'll seek the legate. [Guérin goes out on side opposite to that taken by Officers. SCENE IV. Council Chamber in the Palace. Bishops, Nobles, &amp;c., &amp;c. Torchlight. B. of Paris. [Apart to other Bishops.] If me to this stern office ye depute, I claim support most absolute. A. of Rheims. You have it. I speak for all. B. of Paris. No fear, no compromise, but be your port As dauntless as the bane ye would avert Is quick and awful. Firm, united stand! I doubt the laity, and know the sway This subtle yet rash king doth exercise O'er martial spirits. [A flourish of trumpets. Enter Philip, with Attendants. He ascends the throne. Phil. Greeting kind to all. 'Tis late; but ever should a people's need Make a king's season. To the issue, friends! I know that peril threatens. B. of Paris. It may strike, Sire, while we plot to shun it. Let the knell Of Rome's dread wrath but sound, and France is lost! Her guardian saints desert her; in her streets A curse alights on labour; in her plains Withers her harvest; warps her policy; In war makes her sword edgeless, and her shield 'Gainst the first lance to break; chokes in her fanes The very breath of prayer; unto her dying Denies the rites and solace of the Church, And burial to her dead! Sweet Providence— When daily sent by Heaven to bless the world— Shall make her pilgrimage circuitous Rather than cross this kingdom! Wrath divine, Like doom, hangs o'er the realm, upon whose brow Earth shall write infamy, and God—despair! Phil. 'Tis well: the woes ye so much lay to heart Ye will be prompt to remedy. A. of Rheims. Alas! With us no succour rests. B. of Paris. 'Tis the king's task. Phil. The king's and yours. The marriage you annulled Upon your oaths—the Pontiff would enforce By spiritual menace. He commands; Obedience rests with you. Disown his sentence; Abjure his unjust vengeance; let the Church Through you her holy offices dispense Spite of his edict! Then his ban falls harmless. B. of Paris. What! Wouldst thou have us, prelates of the Church, Defy the Church's head? 'Twere vain as impious; We may not question Rome's prerogative. Phil. You may not palter with your sworn allegiance. Your oaths!—I have your oaths. B. of Paris. All bonds are void That Rome annuls; allegiance' self is void In this behalf. A. of Rheims. Sire! Your late union— [Hesitating. B. of Paris. Your cancelled union with the Lady Marie— Phil. Paris! The foe has been held bold who broke His lance on Philip's buckler; yet he's bolder Who'd snatch from Philip's arms the love he clasps Unto his naked breast! B. of Paris. Even that love Must thou renounce! 'Tis Rome that speaks through me. A. of Rheims. My liege, the Pope— Phil. The Pope, my lords! Four letters!—things, not names! The Pope! Did earth receive him from the stars; Or sprang he from the ocean?—Did the sun Wake earlier on his birthday?—Will eclipse Turn the skies sable at his death? He came Into this world by nature's common road, Needs food to succour life, is chilled by cold, Relaxed by heat, would drown in a rough sea Soon as a serf would!—Let him ban the fields,— The grass will grow in spite of him! B. of Paris. Impiety! Bear'st thou that front so boldly? Phil. I will speak. Man's love—the growth of heaven—of nought below Admits control. Heaven's ministers should know it! 1st Noble. True; by the Oriflamme! 2d Noble. Upon my knighthood, We shame ourselves to see this lady shamed! 3d Noble. Than whom did none more gracious e'er tread earth. My lords, you are miscounselled! [To the Bishops. B. of Paris. What, are you Revolters too? Then— [Bells are heard to toll, and continue to toll at short and regular intervals throughout the scene. Hark! The time is past, The time for duty. King! those sounds declare Thy land cursed for thy sake. With it and thee The heavens break off their league. Wherefore on earth We lay the sacred symbol of our faith In token of the grace profaned and lost! [They lower the crucifix. Submission and repentance—deep, entire— Are all that now remain. [A long pause, during which the tolling of the bells is alone heard. An Officer. Way there; the queen! Enter Marie, followed by her ladies. Marie. Philip, my lord! What mean those fearful sounds? Like echoes of pale Death's advancing tread, They drove me to thine arms, and I am safe. [She rushes to the steps of the throne; at a sign from Philip, she takes her place at his side. But thou?—Speak! Has my love provoked the curse? The lone tree that would yield thee grateful shade Attracts the lightnings now!—Is it so? B. of Paris. Ay; For thee he stands accursed. [A pause; the bells are again heard. Phil. Peal on! we hear. Mark me, ye mitred oath-breakers! But raise One finger, move one step, or breathe one word In furtherance of this curse—and ye shall beg For leave to beg. Of rank, revenue, power, We dispossess you, cast you forth from France, Wherein found against command, you die! Nobles, ring round the throne! B. of Paris. Back from that chair! Marie. Philip! Phil. On your allegiance! B. of Paris. To the Church! Phil. Mayenne! I flung thee knighthood's spurs ere well thy neck Had lost the page's pliant curve. Dumont! I knew thee when thine arms and steed composed Thy sum of fortune. De Latour! we fought Abreast at Palestine. [Shouts and tumult heard without. Enter Guérin. Guér. My liege, all Paris Shrieks wildly at your gates! B. of Paris. [To the Nobles.] Hear, gallant sons! On your souls' love, break up that fatal ring. [They fall back from the throne. Phil. [To Nobles.] And you desert me? Traitors! B. of Paris. Thou art left Alone, lost man; know haughtier crests than thine Have crouched to Rome. Phil. [Passionately, and descending a step.] Crouched, vassal? [With scornful laughter as the Bishop falls back.] Guérin, look, Yon pale-faced monk talks to the king of crouching! [To Bishops and Nobles.] Deem ye my sires, whose tombs were glory's shrines, Have left their sceptre to a bastard hand, That I should crouch?—Speak! plains of Asia, speak! That saw me singly cleave through paynim hordes, As I had wrung Death's truncheon from his gripe! Speak for me, rescued bondsmen! speak for me, Fierce vassals who have knelt to take my yoke, You, you, and you!—No, perjured priest! had Fate Lent her polluted lightnings to your hands, Even as you boast, I'd bid you rain your fires On an unshrinking front. I'd fall a king! Way, there! Sweep back this tide of yeasty froth, That where we pass no spray profane our robes. Way there, I say—The Queen of France would pass! Come! [To Marie. Marie. Not a step. Phil. How? Marie. Not to thy ruin. B. of Paris. Away; all to your homes! His doom is sealed. Who stays to parley with his guilt, partakes it. Marie. Yield, Philip, yield! Stay, I command you stay! [To the Bishops. The king is saved—is saved! You little knew The queen you would degrade. Take back thy crown. [Takes off the crown, and, kneeling, lays it at Philip's feet. Take back the oath thou gav'st me! thou art free, And I no more thy wife! [She descends from the throne. Phil. [Following her.] What hast thou said? Marie forsakes me! Canst thou? Marie. Yes, to save thee. Phil. To save?—to crush me. Marie. Philip, grant one boon. And I remain. Unto the Pope appeal, Or those he shall appoint, to judge our cause. Plead with them thy divorce, thy right to wed me, Owned by these prelates. Then, whate'er the sentence, Thou must abide it. Pledge thy word. Phil. I pledge it. My lords, you stand dismissed. B. of Paris. My liege— Phil. Dismissed! [Impetuously embracing Marie, as the rest retire. They soon shall kiss thy feet! [Bells are still heard to toll.] Ay, clamour on, Vain tongues of doom! Marie is still— Marie. [Clinging to him.] Thy wife!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Soissons. Ante-room leading to the chamber of the Ecclesiastical Council. Enter, at opposite sides, Fontaine, with La Roche, and two Ushers of the Council. Fon. Sirs, are their reverences yet prepared To hear his majesty? 1st Usher. Indeed, I know not; I've no commission. Fon. Two hours hath the king Attended on their summons. 2d Usher. Very like. The Court knows its own season; by your favour. [Ushers withdraw into the chamber. Fon. Delay and insult still from these proud priests, Elate to see a monarch at their bar! Day after day to his impatient suit They pledged decision which, still day by day, They have withheld: while he impatient frets, And the rage boils which dares not overflow. La Roche. The wonder was the king abased himself To plead at their tribunal. Fon. Therein lay His only hope still to preserve his wife, And from the Papal curse deliver France. La Roche. A fruitless hope; they will annul his marriage And Ingerburge replace in Marie's seat. Fon. No; this indignity shall turn to grace If meekly borne. Rome sought to sit in judgment On Philip's cause, and thus maintain her sway O'er Europe's crowns. By secret means I know The king's submission has assuaged her wrath; Awhile she'll scourge him to assert her power, Then take him to her bosom. All is plain. Denmark's to be appeased; Marie pronounced The queen of Philip; Flanders, England—all With whom our rights and vengeance to secure We've secret league—must harm no single hair Of the good boy hid in the Pontiff's mantle! La Roche. That's sorry comfort: Philip reconciled To Rome, were proof against our enmity. Fon. But they must not be reconciled. Already He writhes beneath her yoke, and deems, like thee, The Council will decide against his suit. La Roche. What profit springs from this? Fon. Mark! I have moved him To do himself the deed he fears from them— Restore his Danish queen; which act dissolves The interdict, and sets at nought their power. Their arbitration thus disdained, will breed A bitterer hate than sprang from past defiance. A head has schemed to thwart your holiness, Your child may prove refractory. See, he comes! Enter Philip, followed by Tournet and Attendants. Phil. [To Tournet.] Again, sir, to the Council; say we wait. [Exit Tournet. Attendants retire to back. Yes; what is love that will not prove its truth By needful sacrifice?—Names, empty pomp, Weigh with devotion nought. The faith I pledged Their loss impairs not, and their transfer rends These festering links of shame, gives my soul play, And wipes the abject stain from my renown. In form a little do I wrong thee, Marie, For my essential good. Thou'dst have it so. Why then, when reason offers cordials, Shuns my sick heart her chalice?—Oh, 'tis conscience That doth rebuke my treachery! I have gazed So long on guilty thoughts, they lose their horror. Hither, Fontaine! Did they not say at noon? For weeks we've paced their ante-room to feast The eyes of curious lackeys with our fall. Fon. I may not censure whom your grace endures; Yet, when we last spoke— Phil. Thou didst strike a chord Of evil that now sleeps. Tempt me no more! Fon. I grieve to find my loyalty offence. How have I sinned? I did but say that Rome, By these delays was bent to humble you, And, through you, all the wondering crowns of Europe, Who seeing—pardon me my honest boldness— Who, seeing your subjection, dread their own! Phil. I know it. Fon. Which presumptuous end you crush, And from the Papal curse your realm set free, If of your own inclining you take back The Lady Ingerburge. Phil. My own inclining! Fon. The deed is then your own, not Rome's enforcement. 'Tis Philip's sovereign act, not the Pope's mandate, That restores Ingerburge to throne and wedlock. You thus defeat his power and yours uphold. Phil. [Aside.] It were sweet, most sweet vengeance! Yet my Marie! Man, thou hast looked into my heart, and seen Whose image it enshrines. Shall I rend from her The sacred name of wife, yet bid her share A lawless bed? Like a saint's faith in heaven Is hers in me. In smiling innocence, With love-stirred lips her faith sleeps on my breast; Shall I, her providence, look on and stab? Fon. What path is open then? Reflect—no less You yield her by submission to the Council; You cannot doubt they purpose your divorce. Phil. It may be so; but, if her peace must perish, I need not deal the blow. Fon. If so you deem, Submit; crave peace of Rome— Phil. And kiss the rod! I was not born for this. I lived to make My people great, my reign august,—to pile My monument on triumph till it towered To beacon Time with glory!—Now to shrink Into the thrall of monks, and to infect With my abasement the proud blood of kings; Who, when they crouch beneath the priestly yoke, Shall plead—So first did Philip! Fon. Trust me, sir. You wrong your queen! How poor were pomp to her, If wrung from your disgrace! Phil. Ay; if she saw My struggle with thine eyes! Fon. And so she would. Man cannot master fate. You strive in vain To save her hope from shipwreck, but preserve Your honour in the storm. She'd have it so. Phil. By heaven, I think thou reasonest well; she would! Re-enter Tournet. Tour. My liege! To-day the Council do refuse you hearing. They will forthwith adjourn, and still suspend The hour for sentence. Phil. [With bitter laughter.] Sentence, sentence! What, Yet more delay! My patience has stood bare In their fierce noon of pride until the blood Leaps to my brain like fire! Re-enter Ushers. Sirs, in good time! Fling wide the doors. 1st Usher. My liege, the Court breaks up. Phil. [Imperiously.] Lead on! I bid them stay. Fling wide the doors! [He goes out, preceded by Ushers and followed by Attendants. Fontaine, Tournet, and La Roche remain. Tour. [To Fontaine.] Brave, brave! With skilful breath hast thou revived The ashes of this feud. I see his power Melt in the conflagration. La Roche. Sage, or wizard— Whate'er thou art—our cause owes all to thee. Fon. We have not speared the lion in the woods, But strewed the pit with rushes, and entrapped him. Well, well, the hour may come. Tour. What mood is this? Fon. Even let it go. The time for action's ripe. We yet may meet him front to front as men. Enter Guérin, followed by Retainers. Guér. Recruit your strength. See that your steeds be fleet, And on the instant ready. [Retainers go out.] To the king. [To Fontaine. Fon. Most urgent matter holds him with the Court. Guér. [Drawing Fontaine apart.] More urgent matter claims his ear through me. The blast of war rings out; and, swift from England, John—leagued with Otho and the Flemish count— Has landed at Rochelle. I know thee frank And unsuspecting; keep a wary eye, For disaffection lurks in many a breast That wears a loyal front. Fon. You'll find me watchful. [Guérin goes out. Now with our vassals to enforce the foe! His unjust arm shall work our just revenge. [They go out on the opposite side. SCENE II. Corridor in the Palace. Enter Sir Lucien and Anne. Sir L. She had been bless'd beyond compare if fortune Obeyed desert! Anne. You'd weep to look on her; Her patience touches more than could complaint. When first I seek her chamber, she'll discourse Awhile on trivial things, as if to veil Grief at her heart; yet, what her words would hide, Her faltering step and flitting smile reveal. Alas, dear mistress! [Weeps. Sir L. Why, these are tears! I honour thee for this. Now is thy soul Well mated with thy beauty! [Attempting to take her hand. Anne. [Withdrawing it.] Possibly. But that concerns you little. [Aside.] Stay, I'll try him! Now, say the Church decree the queen's divorce, Should not the king resign her? Sir L. Having sworn To love and shield her? Never! Anne. Then Rome's curse Still rests on France. Sir L. Not if he yield his throne. Anne. How, yield his throne? Sir L. The throne of earth were poor, Save a royal spirit filled it. 'Tis not needful For any man that he be styled a king; But that each man be true to his own manhood, That is most needful. Anne. Good; then, wert thou Philip, How wouldst thou act? Sir L. If truth to her I chose Brought ruin on my realm, I yield my realm, Unclasp my kingly robes, cast off my crown, Take my wife's hand in mine, and trust the soul, That falsehood ne'er had flawed to win me fame. Anne. [Aside, with delight.] So, so—the flash breaks out; a man, by heaven! That's rightly said. My hand upon it, sir. Sir L. And may I keep it? Anne. Yes; until we reach Her grace's antechamber. 'Tis your due. [They go out. SCENE III. An apartment in the Palace. Marie alone. Marie. Another night, and yet no tidings come. Day follows day to mock me in its round. O Time! that to all senseless things dost bear Succour and comfort—the reviving heat And freshening dew to tree and flower and weed— Why dost thou pass the famished heart and smile? Enter Anne. Anne. Dear lady! Marie. [Eagerly.] Anne! Well? No; your face is void! You have no tidings for me. Anne. Alas! none. Marie. We must be patient, Anne. I cannot think The Council will bereave me of my lord. Anne. Heaven touch their hearts with gentleness! Marie. Amen! Anne. And keep the king— [Faltering. Marie. Why falter? Prayers should breathe Trust, and not fear. Anne. Heaven keep King Philip faithful And worthy of your love. Marie. I will not say Amen to that. To pray he may be faithful Were to misdoubt he is so. Anne. All men, being tempted, Are prone to fall; most prone, ambitious kings. Marie. What dost thou mean? Anne. By thoughts on ill that may be To shield your heart from worse. Marie. Worse? What were worse Than treachery in my lord? Rash girl, that word Stretches to woe so infinite, it fathoms An ocean of despair! Uncrown me, slay me, Honours and life must end. Not love! The grave Is as a port where it unlades its wealth For immortality. But rob or taint The merchandise of love—then let the bark Drift helmless o'er the seas, or strike the shoals! They can but wreck a ruin. Anne. Pardon, madam. I would not thus have moved you; but— Marie. Be silent! Thy look doth herald thoughts my soul repels. He did desert me once. You see I read you. No, Anne! His love was changeless, but he quelled it For duty and his country. O shame, shame! Listening thy treason, I adopt it. Go!— Nay, not unkindly. This suspense disturbs me. Leave me awhile. There, there! [Taking her hand. Anne goes out. Another night! It cannot last for ever. Even now The unregarding messenger despatched To bear my doom his onward course may speed. They could not part us, Philip, had they seen Our happy solitude, our inner world Of secret, holy, all-sufficing bliss. They guess it not, nor feel it. At their knees, Locked in my arms, I should have told them this, And forced my heart an avenue to theirs Through all their wiles, for hearts must answer hearts; But mine was dumb, and how could theirs reply? Woe's me! Who comes? Enter Philip. Philip—my lord!—Say, say, May I embrace thee?—may I call thee mine?— Am I thy wife? Phil. Yes; in the sight of Heaven. Marie. And not of earth? A doom told in a breath; Brief, but so cold that it hath froze the fount Whence sorrow gushes! Phil. I am dear to thee? Marie. What! is there hope? If not, encourage none. Phil. Why should we be the slaves of Rome? Marie. Thou wilt Resist his mandate? Yet thy kingdom, love? Phil. Dearest, most faithful! We may still remain Bound to each other, and the Papal curse Pass from the realm. Marie. How?—Haste thee to disclose. Phil. The Council has pronounced no sentence. Marie. Yet Thou art returned! Phil. Like to a criminal I stood before the conclave. Every day Brought some new contumely. The weight I bore Of strained suspense and nice indignity Was pleasant pastime for them; and they lingered, Protracting their enjoyment, and inviting The universe to look on haughty Philip Crouched at their stools, and learn from thence how Rome Would deal with rebel kings! Marie. And yet you bore it? Phil. It was the Church's aim to judge my cause, To plant its insolent foot upon my neck, Humbling all crowns in mine. I looked for this; I bore it long. At last scorn heaped on scorn Turned patience to revolt. Marie. [After a short pause.] And then? How then? Phil. [Avoiding her look.] Marie! I said within my soul, my pomp, My title, all my gilded shows of power, Were not the links that bound thy love to mine. Was I right there? Marie. Can Philip ask that question? Phil. Her trust doth sting me more than could reproach. Too late, too late! all must be told! [Aside. Marie. What followed? Phil. I will not hear your judgment, lords, I cried: Not moved by you, but of my sovereign will, I have resolved that Marie shall resign The throne and empty state she never prized, And Ingerburge to her lost dignities Be straight restored. 'Tis all that Denmark seeks; Therefore dissolve the interdict! Marie. Thou saidst this?— Heard I aright? Phil. [Confused.] Marie, thou didst. Marie. And Philip Could of his proper will cast Marie out! I thought—I thought you said we should not part. Phil. Part—never, never! Part! Marie. But have you not owned Ingerburge your wife? I am no longer queen. Phil. But for all this, We must not part. Marie. Husband—I pray your pardon; I can't forget you were so—torture not My mind with this perplexity! How is't I can be thine, and Ingerburge thy wife? Phil. [After a pause.] She is but so in name; thou wilt retain The empire of my heart. Marie. Ha! how the light— The cruel light I could not see before— Bursts on my sight! No; 'tis some hideous dream. Although I see, I shall not touch thy hand. [Takes his hand, as if to assure herself. It is reality! And yet—forgive me! A subtle tempter through my o'erwrought brain Would stab my trust in thee. He shall not, love! Even now I'm calmer. Pray, repeat the words— The words you spake but now. Phil. I said, my own, Though Ingerburge might bear the name of queen, Thou only shouldst rule Philip— Marie. Pause awhile. Though Ingerburge might bear the name of queen, I only should rule Philip— [Signs to him to proceed. Phil. Thou shouldst share His hours of love—thou only; thou shouldst be— [Hesitating, and averting his head. Marie. His paramour! O God! although his voice Was shamed from speech, this is the thing he means. [She turns from him. Phil. Thou wouldst not go? Marie. I am already gone! We measure distance by the heart. Phil. Yet hear me! Marie. The Duke de Méran's daughter listens, sir. [She sits. Phil. [About to kneel.] If this humility may aught— Marie. No knee! Respect so far my woe's reality, As to put by these pageant semblances. Phil. Oh! has this grief no remedy? Marie. None, none. The faith of love no hand can wound but that Was pledged to guard it. Then what hand can staunch? We strive no more with doom; the sad mistake May be endured, but not retrieved. No, no! Phil. By heaven, you do me wrong! 'Tis not in man To conquer destiny. I made you queen. Marie. You made me queen! I made you more than king. When my eyes raised their worship to thy face, I saw no crown. I asked not if thy hand Closed on a sceptre; but mine pressed it close, Because it rent the shackles of the slave. 'Twas not thy grandeur won me. Had the earthquake Engulfed thine empire—had frowning fate Lowered on thine arms and scourged thee from the field, A fugitive—if on thy forehead Rome Had graved her curse, and all thy kind recoiled In horror from thy side—I yet had cried, There is no brand upon thy heart; let that In the vast loneliness, still beat to mine! Phil. [Falling at her feet.] You had; you had! the dust is on my head! Sweet saint! thou'rt of a higher brood than we, Hast right to spurn me from thee. Marie. Rise! The feet By thorns on life's rough path so often pierced, Are little like to spurn a stumbling brother. Phil. Forgive, forgive me, Marie! [Rising. Marie. You repent. Twas but delusion. You will be again The Philip I adored! That hope shall bless me When we are far apart. And now for ever In this dark world farewell. Another land I seek, but ne'er shall find another home. Shield him, all holy powers! Philip— [Extending her hand. Phil. Go, go; I was not worthy thee! Marie. Not thus, not thus! Phil. But one embrace. It is the last, the last! [They embrace. Go, Marie! [Marie goes to the door. She reverts her head. They regard each other in silence for a few moments, after which Marie slowly disappears. Phil. [After a pause, sinking into a chair.] I'm alone on earth! She's gone, And what is left me? [The roll of drums is heard without. He suddenly rises. Ha! that clamour speaks In stern reply; a summons to the field! Fate, that denies me love, has left me vengeance. Friends fail me, foemen swarm my coasts. 'Tis well! Now, fiend of war, I am devote to thee! [He rushes out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The French tent near Bouvines. Soldiers stationed at the entrance. Intermitted and distant alarms. Enter Guérin and Sir Lucien, the latter attired as from a journey. Sir L. Is it indeed so? has this mighty league, Whose frown eclipsed the light of France, dissolved, And left no sign in air? What, Otho fled! Guér. He scarce escaped with life. The Count of Flanders Lies captive, with a hundred meaner names, Yet all renowned. Sir L. Then was the rout complete? Guér. Long as his steed upbore him, chased the king The flying remnant, vengeance still his cry. His foes will rue this day. Sir L. And I have lost The fame of it, though but an hour too late. Guér. Thou art misfortune's herald, and he comes Always too soon. Thou bear'st a woe so vast 'Twould weigh down empire in the opposing scale. Sir L. Nay, had my foot been heavy as my heart, I ne'er had borne these news of my dear lady; Nor had I, save at her express command, Ever resigned her service for the king's. Guér. Sweet patience keep him! Is there then no hope? Sir L. None; or a hope so sickly that it smiles In mockery of itself. Those who have seen her Report by slow advance her fate draws near; Most like the shades that deepen over day So softly that we start to find it gone. Guér. Awhile retire. [Sir Lucien joins the soldiers at the entrance of the tent. King, had thine ends been true Either unto thy people or thy love, This grief had never been! Oh, better ne'er To know the good, than knowing—violate! High thoughts, which touch but do not rule the soul, Shall turn their light to fire. [Martial music heard without. Ah! 'tis the king. Enter Philip, preceded by soldiers, with banners, Nobles, &amp;c. Martial music from the troops without. Phil. [At the entrance of the tent.] Again! [Triumphant music and acclamations. And yet again! [The same sounds renewed.] This swelling strain Salutes ye, Flanders, Austria, England. Dumb! Oh, this is victory, Guérin! [Advancing to the front. Guér. He who rules The fate of kings hath bless'd you. Phil. The brave heart Makes its own fate! What, wouldst thou grudge this arm The glory of this day? Like autumn leaves Whirled by the eddying blast; like spars of wrecks Tossed shorewards by the seas, they fled before me! My lifted arm was doom, my steps were graves! I chased them still! With every stroke I mowed A separate host for death! My steps were graves! Kings are my captives, home revolters quelled; Fontaine, the traitor, measures the red plain Whereon I stretched him. Well, prate on, prate on! Guér. And sleeps that restless brain? Is Fontaine dead? Phil. Ay; and his issue, friends, abettors, all The baneful offshoots of this traitorous stem Will we uproot, even to the infant germ That knows not yet the poisonous life it folds. Guér. I cast a shield over a vanquished foe When I recall the Lady Marie's name. Phil. I've won her by the sword, and so will guard her. Report again these glorious news from Rome; The war's dread thunder clamoured in mine ear And shut out half thy tidings. Guér. Ingerburge, Your queen, thereto persuaded by the Pope, Has to the shelter of religious walls From worldly strife retired, to thee resigned Her royal throne and bed, and sought divorce: Rome thus would win back thine offended power Whose aid she needs to curb rebellious John. Phil. What! Rome hath learned to need, then? Guér. Meekly say it; Your patron saint has blessed you. Phil. [Raising his sword.] Patron Saint! I thank thee. Marie, Marie, where dost hide Thyself from bliss? Not seen in Méranie! Fled weeks since, and not sought her father's arms! Was it not yesterday that we despatched Our envoys in her quest? Guér. It was, my liege. Your messenger already is returned. Phil. Returned?—his errand unfulfilled? Guér. Not so; But some leagues from the field, this very spot, An ancient castle stands. Willing, perchance, To shun familiar scenes and questioning tongues— Yea, aught that might recall her bitter past— Your wife has fixed her rest there! Phil. He has seen her! Summon him hither. Guér. Sire, he waits; Sir Lucien, Stand forth! [Sir Lucien advances Phil. Thy stars, young sir, did yestermorn Rain fortune on thee as thou gott'st to horse. Thou hast found the Lady Marie? Sir L. Sire, I found Her place of sojourn. Phil. Well, say on! Sir L. My king! [Hesitating. Phil. Say on! By Heaven, that clouded brow affronts The favour we design thee! Thou hast seen her, Spoken with her, bear'st her answer? Quick, unfold! Sir L. Pardon, I saw her not. Phil. What! at her gates, And yet not seen her. Hadst thou not credentials From us unto her presence? Sir L. Sire, most true. Phil. And she denied thee audience? Sir L. Nay, she knows not Even that I sought it. Phil. Thou art fond of danger To dally with impatient majesty! Sir L. My lord! [He again hesitates, and turns to Guérin. Phil. My lord! What means this juggling? Why Bend thy regards on him, and with thine eyes People the air with terrors? Set before me Some actual mischief which, being known, my soul May fix and grapple with, lest, mad with doubt, To snatch the truth I plunge into thy life! Sir L. You need all patience, sir, the queen is found; But in such case I rather would report My mission fruitless. If as yet she live, 'Tis nigh the verge of death, her flame of life So flickering, that a breath might quench it. Hence Did they refuse me audience, and withhold My errand, nay, my presence, from herself. Phil. I would have slain thee to compel these words Which, being uttered, slay my peace for ever! [Sir Lucien retires. Guér. My gracious master! Phil. Had the heavens no bolt In all their armoury but this? Guér. Bethink you— Phil. Perdition on all counsel! Guér. Hear me, sire! Phil. Hear thee! When thou canst say to sceptred Death, “Fall back,” and he obeys, I'll hear thee then. For her I bore, schemed, fought; yea, singly breasted The raging tide of war, and dashed to land! I've staked with fate, and lost! Guér. Are you a king? Phil. A king! Ay, that's the name For which I bartered love, and ruthless stabbed The trusting heart that drew its life from mine. Yes, by this glory shining on the tomb, This banquet of renown that palls the taste, This wealth upon the desert where I famish, I am that empty sound—I am a king! Guér. Find medicine for the sorrows of this day In thinking of its triumph. Phil. Hence! Ye heavens! Abase me if ye will; pluck from me pomp, Scorch my green laurels with your jealous fires, Drain on my abject and discrownèd head Your vials of derision, want, oblivion! But spare her, spare her; she is like yourselves! Guér. My sovereign, Providence is merciful To contrite hearts. Say that the queen declines From grief that you resigned her: what if now, Freed from all other bonds, your union Allowed by Rome, you hasten to her side, Bearing these news for cordial? Perchance, For love is strong and joy miraculous, You yet may save her. Phil. [Grasping his hand.] Ah! to horse, to horse! I hold thee as a brother for these words. Summon our host; awake the trumpet's breath To speed our flight, for we must outride Death! [All go out with flourish. SCENE II. An apartment in an old Château near Bouvines. Marie and Anne. Anne. [Seated at Marie's feet.] No, no, sweet mistress, I cannot bear The intrusion of these thoughts! Marie. Kind, faithful girl, Marie's last solace! Anne. Last! What, must your life Thus wither in its spring? I could not live In this harsh world and lose you! Marie. Hist! what sound Was that? Anne. I heard none. Marie. 'Twas the tramp of horse; Look forth. [Anne goes to window.] What see'st thou? Anne. But the village hind Leading his team from field. [She returns to her place at Marie's feet. Marie. [Taking her hand.] Heaven's benison Rest on thy head and Lucien's. He is brave, Honoured, and constant. Will the matron's coif And braided hair become thy face? Methinks I see thee in the light of coming summers, Thy happy children bounding at thy side, Or clustered at thy feet. Should one fair girl With glance of playful love reflect thine own, Thou'lt call her Marie for my sake? Anne. I will. Marie. I wished to see thee wed, Anne, and bestow This bauble at thy bridals; but ere then— There dearest! [Takes a chain from her neck, and with visible effort places it round Anne's. Anne. You will break my heart. [Marie sinks back.] Dear Heaven, She swoons! Her life is passing! Marie. [Rallying.] Do not fear, I shall not die yet. I shall first see Philip. Anne. [Aside.] Still, still that feverish hope dispels her rest. [Aloud.] He knows not where thou art. Marie. Heaven will direct him. Anne. The foeman's camp divides you. Marie. Heaven will guard him Through hosts of foes; he'll come. [Restlessly.] Your hand, sweet, raise me; I breathe with effort. [Anne props her with cushions; as she does so, Marie's ring drops off.] See! my ring is fallen, The ring that pledged me his. [Rather excitedly.] Replace it, quickly. I would not he should miss it when he comes. [Anne replaces the ring, and kisses Marie's hand. So; thanks! [A horn is heard without. Marie starts forward.] Hark, hark! a trumpet. Now, look forth! Anne. [Going to window and returning.] 'Tis but the horn of the returning huntsmen. Marie. Not Philip! Still, he'll come! Anne. [Aside.] To see the wreck His falsehood made. [Aloud.] Compose yourself: rest, sleep! Think not of him. Marie. Then must I cease to think. He'll come; but strength may fail me. Thou must tell him All that I leave unsaid. Anne. You task me hardly, Has not his treachery poisoned all thy joy? Marie. Ah me! his love first taught me what joy was. Anne. What can'st thou give him more than life? Marie. My death; The hope that I may bless him from the grave. Have not some said our spirits minister To those we loved on earth, guide them from wrong And draw them nearer heaven? Anne. [Turning away.] My friend, my friend! Marie. [Drawing her back.] Come closer, sweet; O, hoard each accent now! When all with me is over, seek the king: He may be racked with grief, perhaps remorse, For this slight fabric's fall. Thou'lt bear him comfort? Anne. [Aside.] I bear him comfort! Marie. Tell him that I passed In peace from earth; that, in my closing hours, I thought of those made precious by his love, And shunned all harsher memories! Tears! Anne. No more! Marie. [Earnestly.] Thou'lt see the king—thou'lt not deny me? Anne. [With irrepressible emotion.] Yes; I'll see him, and demand him where he cast The first gem of his crown—why filched from earth Its holiest saint—my best, best friend from me. [She bursts into tears. Marie. Anne, Anne! Anne. I'll haunt him through the world; I'll burst The serried war to reach him; in the pomp Of courts appal him with my agony, And cry, “Thy wife! Where, traitor, is thy wife?” [Starting to her feet. Marie. No, no! Thou torturest me! Silence! The queen Commands. Anne. O for a voice to curse him! Marie. [Rising.] Anne, Thy hand [seizing it] thus link'd, almost from infancy, We have trod life's path together. Nought we met On the long journey sever'd us. The clasp Each step grew closer. Now for me the way Winds to the grave—disjoin we now? Anne. No! Marie. Yes; My travel's end so near, we're twain at last, And I go down unfriended to the tomb, Save thou renounce thy purpose. Promise, speak, Or I let go thy hand! Shall I? Anne. No, no! I promise all. Marie. [Falling upon her neck.] That's my own faithful Anne! [She sinks into a chair. Now leave me, sweet one! I would muse in peace. Anne. And may peace keep thy soul! [After a pause, watching her.] At last she rests; Her eyelids lay their fringe on her pale cheek. Visit her, gentle sleep; on thy soft wing Bear her from this harsh present back to youth— Perchance to her green home in Méranie, Where guardian mountain rise, and singing streams Leap down in laughter, where the chamois bounds From steep to steep, and shepherd's pipe or horn Make glad the valley. There did we partake The sports, the innocent hopes and loves of childhood, Nor guessed the fate to come. . . . . Does she yet sleep? Her eyes are sealed; but those parched leaves, her lips, Stir with a wind of thought, and all her look Seems strained and listening. Ah! she speaks. Marie. [Grasping at Anne's hand.] Anne, Anne! Anne. Ay, sweet. Marie. [Raising herself.] Didst hear? Anne. Hear what? Marie. He comes, he comes! Anne. 'Twas but a dream. Marie. Dream! From Death's opening gates Those sounds recalled me. Dost thou hear them now? Anne. [Listening.] She's right—the clang of hoofs! [Rushes to window.] Troops, lady, troops! Marie. Do they make hither? Anne. Ay, at speed. Marie. What troops? Anne. French, if the twilight do not cheat mine eyes. Madam, the power of France! Marie. Of France! I knew it. My dimming gaze will reach him—his farewell Close on my ear, the music of this world! Come they not nearer, Anne? Look forth! Anne. They pause; But for a moment. He who seems their chief Motions them forward. They pass on— Marie. They pass! My lord is with them, yet they pass. Stay, Philip— 'Tis Marie calls—I shall not see thee—death Knocks at my heart, and all that was my life Swims from my eyes! Stay, stay in mercy! Philip! [She rises, and rushes to the window. Anne. Thy prayer is heard; they cross the moat, they enter. Marie. Ha, look, that knight! Anne. His visor's closed. Marie. To thee. My soul looks through it. 'Tis the king! Come, come! Anne. Await him here. Marie. Time will not wait, nor death. [She pauses as if overcome. Anne supports her. The shadows press around me: all is dim; He comes too late. Anne. Hark! footsteps! Marie. Ah! Phil. [Without.] My Marie! My wife! Philip, who has laid aside his helmet, rushes in. Marie. Ah, Philip, Philip! on thy breast! Phil. She lives—she stands! This is no couch of death! Marie. I hold thee, see thee; thou art safe, victorious! Phil. Three realms are at my foot. My throne is fixed, Rock-like for ever; thy throne, Queen of France! The conqueror is thy slave. Marie. [Faintly.] Use well thy power, Dear lord, when I am gone. Be thy sway bless'd, Thy memory revered! Phil. When thou art gone! What mean those cruel words? Thy looks affright me! The shadows of thine eyes eclipse thy soul! Marie. The angel tarried for thy coming. Now My head is on his breast;—I die! Phil. Not now, Thou must not, shalt not! I will cling to thee, And round thy mounting spirit twine my clasp Till the huge weight of misery drag thee down. [Supporting her to her chair. Avaunt, pale phantom! 'Tis the victor king Waves off thy shadowy dart and guards thy prey! Speak, Marie! speak to me! Anne. Alas! her touch Shoots to my heart, and chills it. Phil. Ay, the skies Do envy earth its bliss, so call her back. O God! the brows are growing marble cold To which I bear a crown. Marie, my wife! [Anne, who has been kneeling by Marie's side, utters a faint cry, and rushes up to Philip. Anne. She bless'd thee ere she died! Enter Guérin and several Nobles with Attendants. At a sign from Anne they stand fixed and silent. Phil. And this is fame! [He sinks before the body of Marie, which still occupies the chair. The rest stand in attitudes of awe and dejection. The soldiers veil their lances. The curtain falls to solemn music. END OF MARIE DE MÉRANIE.</field>
