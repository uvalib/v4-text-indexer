      <field name="fulltext">PEDRARIAS, A TRAGIC DRAMA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This drama was written in May 1811, and has been revised at different periods since. For the story see âLes Incasâ of Marmontel. As it is one of pure invention, it was thought allowable to take great liberties with it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Pedrarias D'Avila, governor of the Isthmus of Darien. Alphonso, his son. Gusman, his minister. Lopez, and other Spanish nobles. Perez, a spy. Capana, an Indian cacique. Houaco, his son, at first under the name of Zamori. Thelasco, an Indian warrior. Kali, an Indian. Lascala, an old Indian. Amazilia, a young Indian woman of high birth, betrothed to Houaco. Laila, her friend. An old Indian woman. Spanish Soldiers, Indians, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, Panama, and mountains of the adjacent country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Indian Scenery. Groups of Indians pass over the stage with garlands, &amp;c. as if busily employed in preparations for a rustic sacrifice. Thelasco enters alone from the opposite side, and Kali comes forward from the other Indians to meet him. KALI. Welcome, Thelasco, welcome! Thou return'st In happy hour. Our good cacique, Capana, Wills that the feast of vengeance be completed This very day. The rites are all prepared. THELASCO. What mean'st thou, Kali? Ere the last moon waned, Nine of the fell invaders, by our warriors Surprised and taken on yon wilds, had bled: One breathed alone, when with my chosen band Again I sought the foe. KALI. True, brave Thelasco; For nine successive days our people feasted, Pouring forth songs before the God of Vengeance, While on his altars flow'd a Spaniard's blood; But nought of joy stole on the settled sorrow Of good Capana. On the tenth, the sun Frown'd on our rites; the angry thunders roar'd; The ominous tear rolled down Capana's cheek; The rites were stopp'd. THELASCO. But sure the sun has smiled With ray benignant many a day since then? KALI. And yet the sacrifice has still been stay'd. Our great cacique best reads portentous skies, Nor till this day has deem'd the signs propitious. With sadden'd brow e'en nowâ THELASCO. Alas! what sadness Can thus hang heavy on Capana's breast? Has he not saved the remnant of his people By his sole godlike wisdom, and his valour? Did he not lead us, press'd by foes and famine, O'er mountains, inaccessible to all But those who follow such a leader? One, Whose bleeding wounds mark, drop by drop, the course He cheers his bands to follow: whose parch'd lips, Smiling, refuse the cooling draught we scoop In the cleft rockâbidding his follower drink! Till in this valley, by these heights hemm'd in, (Committing us, as 'twere, to Nature's bosom), He bids us live secureâbeyond the reach Of fierce Pedrarias, and his lawless rout. Can he retrace these deeds and taste of sadness? KALI. Valiant Thelasco!âthou art not a father, Or had'st not ask'd that question. THELASCO. True:âHouaco Was on the fatal field or slain, or lost; But two long summers, since gone by, might blunt Remembrance:âand the bloody day that reft Capana of a people, and a son, Closed that son's course in glory! Mark'd you not How many his unerring hatchet laid in dust? I saw them writhe in death! I heard them groan! That is a music never shall be poured Upon th'invader's ear from Indian lips Speaking of the natives on the coast of those provinces known by the names of Paria and Cumana, Robertson says, âThey seemed to possess a better understanding, and greater courage, than the inhabitants of the islands.â History of America, Book II.! We laugh amidst the tortures they inflict, And sing our death songâwhile these sons o'th' sea, (Cast by distemper'd ocean on our shores), If chance the feather'd shaft, or missile bone, Invade their blanch'd and delicate limbs, forget, And shame, their manhood thus. KALI. Yet by their arts Of fatal magic, that compel the cloud To yield reluctant from its wreathing folds The smouldering boltâby their bright arms that flash Forged lightnings, bickering, impious, to the sun, And by their iron coats that mock our shafts, They are invincible. THELASCO. Invincible! No, Kali, no. Hast thou not seen the deep With hideous swell, wave over wave, bear on, As it would swallow, in its might, our shores? And do not still our green and laughing shores Mock at its rage? E'en thus let us oppose Resistance firm, unalterableâthus mock Their glittering terrors, and their coward mail. KALI. Such reckless valour, what has it avail'd us? THELASCO. And dost thou call that valour reckless valour Which saved thee, Kali, and thy trembling fellows, When conquer'd by these idle fears ye fled, Or fell unhurt? Eternal shame!âNo moreâ We loiter. I to Capana must report How undisturb'd I and my band have roam'd The unpeopled wastes, nor found a straggler more Of this fell race, to thee so terrible! [Exeunt severally. Amazilia and Laila come forward from among the woody scenery. LAILA following AMAZILIA, who seems to avoid her). All is prepared. The troops of damsels hymn The song of sacrifice. Fair Amazilia, Here is a wreath of flowers to deck thy brow: Here is thy flowing veil: thou heed'st me notâ Thou dost not smile. AMAZILIA. Why should I smile, my Laila? This is a solemn sacrificeâa sad one. Is not death sad? LAILA. When 'tis our foe that dies, We Indians âEven after the error which gave rise to this opinion (that the new world was part of India) was detected, and the true position of the new world was ascertained, the name has remained; and the appellation of West Indies is given by all the people of Europe to the country, and that of Indians to its inhabitants.â âRobertson's History of America, Book II. hold it is a joyous sight. AMAZILIA. âOur foe?ââMethinks this poor, ill-fated youth, Has not the semblance of a foe to any. LAILA. Is he not of the band of fell destroyers? Dost thou not hate him? AMAZILIA. YesâI hope I hate him. LAILA. Why dies the word upon thy faltering lip? AMAZILIA (taking her hand affectionately). Thou wast my friend. Am I still dear to thee? LAILA. Indeed, indeed, thou art! I never thought But as thy nobler nature swayed my mind, And am in all devoted to thy will. AMAZILIA. A month has pass'd, and ever as this youth Has been led forth to bleed before our gods, Thou know'st Capana has been moved to pity; And canst thou blame a woman's gentler nature, If, touch'd with soft compassion, I relented? I would not see him die. LAILA. The God of Vengeance Demands his blood. AMAZILIA (with energy). Oh! but the God of Mercy Bids the poor captive live! LAILA. Alas! the Indians Know not of such a Godâand how shouldst thou? AMAZILIA. The captive Christian bade me serve him, Laila! LAILA. Thy words and gestures fill my soul with terror. How couldst thou learn aught of the captive's worship? AMAZILIA. Each night, when all, within this happy valley, Lay hush'd in sleep, compassion led my steps To the young captive's cave; and near the entrance, Unseen by him, I oft would chant the lays Our mothers teach, when death has claim'd our warriors, To cheat the hideous phantom of his terrors. But while I sang of nature's sweet repose, Lapt in the bosom of the parent earth, My heart disown'd the fraudâand form'd the wish That he might live, whom thus I woo'd to die! He too address'd me in such accents, Laila, I could not choose but listen. His heav'n-taught words, Awful yet sweet, waked in me a new soul. In lowly ignorance, and abject fear, Erewhile I trembled when the thunders roll'd; And in each element a mighty power, Angry and vengeful, sought t'appease. But now, Oh now! a father's warning voice I hear In solemn thunders!âsee his gracious smile In the sun's beamsâhis hand beneficent In the earth's fruitsânor fear might infinite, With goodness infinite!âInfinite mercy, Wisdom, and loveâas in Alphonso's God! LAILA. And did a God so bounteous send them forth To ravage India? AMAZILIA. No;âhe bade them spare. More have I learnt, my Laila. These destroyers, These cruel men who drench our land with blood, Have some among them who are like this youth; But they are few, and o'erborne by the many. LAILA. Oft, Amazilia, have I mark'd of late Thy alter'd mien, and the high views that fill'd Thy labouring mind: still thou wert ever kind, Nor didst disdain thy Laila's humble love. Give me then all thy thoughts. AMAZILIA. They are allâall, To save the youth! Dear Laila, come with me, And we will pray Alphonso's God to aid us: He will inspire my dark, untutor'd mind In his own holy causeâthe cause of mercy! [Exeunt. SCENE II. A deep valley, inclosed by inaccessible mountains, filled with Indian huts, mixed with palm-trees, &amp;c. In the front a rustic throne under a spreading palm, and an altar with an image rudely carved, representing the God of Vengeance. Enter Capana (properly attended), in conversation with Thelasco. CAPANA. Believe me, brave Thelasco, 'tis not weakness. Thou hast shared my counsels, and hast ever been My partner in the fight. When hast thou known Vain shapes, and idle phantoms, move my spirit? Our very Gods have pleaded for this youth: A boding voice has sounded in my heart; Nay, strange portentous signs have stain'd the skies! The guards that, nightly watching, skirt the valley, Have heard melodious warblings round his cave, Soothing his slumbers, and have trembled, awe-struck. Whene'er I communed with him, he, methought, Held all my troubled spirit in control. If these destroyers are like him endow'd, Alas! for India's sons! THELASCO. Alas! for thee! Alas! for India's sons, should he escape! He would divulge the place of our retreat. CAPANA (sorrowfully). I know it well: and therefore have decreed The consummation of the sacrifice. THELASCO. That one of this fell race should move thee thus! CAPANA. He is a father's only son, he says: I had no son, my friend, save young Houaco. [Brushing away a tear. What had I felt had he a captive stood Before a Spaniard? THELASCO. Ha! had he found mercy? Let double tortures rack this cozener! [The procession for the sacrifice approaches, winding through the trees. Alphonso bound and guarded. CAPANA. They lead him on, but ere he sleep in death, Thou too shalt hear him, and astonish'd, won, To pity yielding, wilt revoke this wish. [He makes signs that Alphonso should be brought before him, and ascends the throne. ALPHONSO. Cacique! What would'st thou with me? I have pray'd The God I worship not to visit on thee My innocent blood: and almost am resigned To quit this life, ere I have aught achieved Of all the mighty purpose of my soul. THELASCO. Thy coward spirit shrinks from death, it seems; We Indians welcome the repose he brings. ALPHONSO. It is the coward spirit, haughty Indian, That welcomes soft repose. But, fearless, I Would welcome dangers, toils, severest ills, In glory's cause; and would not lay me down, In all the pride, and strength of manhood, thus Unhonour'd and unwept! THELASCO. What call'st thou âglory?â Thousands of friendly Indians at thy feet Butcher'd by fraud, who on their shores received With songs and dances, and with garlands crown'd ye, As welcome guests? ALPHONSO. I was a stripling then: With horror marked the deed, and, in my heart, Vow'd I would ever be the Indian's friend! Nor have I stained this hand with Indian blood. Nay, oft my youthful pleadings have prevailed With one, whose sterner temper own'd no check, Save my poor prayers and tears. [Checking himself; then with energy. Yes, I would live! I feel such impulses within my breast, To mark my course by justice and by mercy, That I would live! Yet would exulting meet Death, linked with torture, if with glory linked! But thus to fall! CAPANA (to THELASCO aside). What wrong would'st thou avenge? Say, what his crime? THELASCO. That he was born a Spaniard. Was it not guilt enough in Spanish eyes, That we were Indian born? CAPANA. Not so with him. (To ALPHONSO with emotion). Were I, in weak compassion to thy youth, To give thee life! ALPHONSO (eagerly). And liberty! CAPANA. Thy liberty Were our destruction. Here thou must abide. ALPHONSO. Death has no terrors now! Command the rites. CAPANA. Thou would'st reveal the place of our retreat. ALPHONSO. What wilt thou trust if not the grateful heart? CAPANA. Nay, not thy heart: I but mistrust thy youth. In fellow feeling for a father's pain, Who has no son but theeâI could relentâ ALPHONSO. Not to my father must thou give my life! Lead onâI will not practise on thy goodness. CAPANA. Not to thy father? 'Tis for him I feel! I too have lost an only son, and would not Another father should feel pangs like mine! ALPHONSO. Generous Capana! I will not deceive thee. Know, should'st thou give me life and liberty, It is Pedrarias' son thou bind'st to thee! CAPANA (with horror). The fell Pedrarias! THELASCO. Ha! Pedrarias, say'st thou? He who, insatiable of Indian blood, Clapping his gory palms, cheer'd on his dogs To trace our weary steps, and piecemeal tear Our quiv'ring flesh! Pedrarias! the destroyer! Beneath whose murderous stroke our fathers fell; Whose name our widows curse, and, but pronounced, Serves as a bugbear to their orphan babes! (To the attendants). Invent new tortures for Pedrarias' son! (The Indians rush forward with expressions of fury). AMAZILIA (breaking from the troop of damsels). Hold! hold! forbear! Ye know not what ye do! A God, far other than the God of Vengeance, Speaks by my simple tongue, and will be heard! Say, if revenge were sweet, as we are taught, Have not nine victims bled upon this altar? And who has yet seen good Capana smile? What son regains the father he has lost? What widow ceases to deplore her husband? The victims bled, while we, with giddy songs, Drown'd nature's voice! They bledâand all was o'er! In our lone cabins, when retired to rest, Say, were our sorrows soothed? [All hang their heads mournfully. I!âI will tell How noble spirits seek a sweet revenge! Give him a son who robb'd thee, chief, of thine, And see the humbled tyrant at thy feet Owe all to him he injured, and confess He learns of thee to serve the God he boasts! CAPANA (with great emotion). Thy words, my Amazilia, reach my soul, And shake its temperâ [Striking his breast. Oh! I feel them here! ALPHONSO (aside). That voice! whose every tone my heart-strings answer With strong vibrations, sweet e'en to agony! Those charms! nor seen, nor imaged, till this hour! CAPANA (after a conflict, descending from his throne). Son of the man who desolates my countryâ Whom pity never touch'dâson of Pedrariasâ I give thee life!âI give thee liberty! [Alphonso throws himself at his feet. Go to thy father. Say, an Indian chief, Whose people he has swept from off the earth, Whom he has doom'd to childless age, and sorrow, Low at his feet saw fell Pedrarias' son! Within his grasp each instrument of tortureâ And raised him thus, and press'd him to his bosom! [Raising and embracing him. ALPHONSO. Oh generous! generous! Thouâmy more than father! CAPANA. Speak not Capana's name, nor e'er reveal The place of our retreat. [Alphonso is kneeling to swear. Nay, swear not, youth. It is impossible thou should'st betray us. ALPHONSO. Oh thou so noble! Thou, who serv'st so well The Christian's God! and thou! divinest maid! My guardian angel! Oh! I cannot speak My soul's wild tumult!âyes, the life ye give Devoted to your weal! I here abjure My country's cruel cause. Trust me, cacique, Nor prayers nor threats shall wring thy secret from me. A father's wrath were vain. But far, far otherwise His grateful thoughts will prompt. This deed will wake An Indian soul in great Pedrarias' breast; And sure, if benefits can e'er atone The wrongs ye've suffer'd, sure ye will be blest! Oh that he could alike restore thy son, And render joy for joy! CAPANA. Houaco fell With thousands of my butcher'd people, youth. Wake not the thought, while thus a something new, Awful, exalted, soothes my heart's long sorrow! 'Tis not a father's wrath will shake thy soul. Thou know'st him not. Beware his thanks! his blessings! Oh! let not these betray thy simple heart To break thy promise!âno, not if he swore To place me on the throne of all these realms, Himself my subject, and his arm my stay. Name not Capana, nor his place of rest; Not e'en to Indians, now the invader's slaves! I and my friends ask but to be forgotten. And should thy guileless youth, o'ermatch'd by fraud, And semblance fair, aught falter, look on this! [Taking an ornament from his own neck, and hanging it on Alphonso's. Think of Capana, and be firm again. ALPHONSO. Dear, honour'd pledge! that never but with life Shalt quit this bosom! [After gazing on it, and pressing it to his bosom. Visions of glorious deeds! Bright hopes that float confus'dly in my brain! Yes, I was born the instrument of mercy! My father now shall hail you men, and brothers; Shall sheathe the sword, and ye shall come anon, Won by the fame of his good deeds, shall comeâ CAPANA. Alas! thou dreamest, poor ingenuous youth! Depart!âMy people shall conduct thy steps Among the yawning gulfs, and rocks stupendous That gird this valley, shutting out each eye, Save that of the all-searching, sacred sun. ALPHONSO. Yet ere I part, Cacique, oh! let me breathe A prayer for her, that unknown, heavenly maid, Who calls me to a newâa dearer life! [As he kneels and takes her hand. AMAZILIA. Awayâaway, youth!âSee, Thelasco frowns. Oh fly!âfarewell!âYet if e'er aught of sorrow Visit thee, in that hour think of the maid Who soothed, erewhile, thy anguish; and who still, Oh! still would fainâyet never must again Or seeâor hear theeâyouth. [Appears overcome, and then with sudden transport. But thou wilt live! 'Twas all I ask'd! ALPHONSO. This life, thy gift, were vain, My guardian angel! vain were deeds of worth Not by thy smile approved!âand saidst thou never? That word of dreadful importâOh! recall it, For till this hour, thou matchless excellence!â THELASCO. Why linger'st thou? Art thou not free?âAway! And may each torture, vengeance can devise, Rack thy false soul if thou break faith with us! [Exit Alphonso on one side, escorted by a troop of Indians; Capana and Thelasco on the other. Amazilia and Laila remain. AMAZILIA (after gazing till ALPHONSO is out of sight). And is he gone? for ever gone, my Laila? And must I in this valley still remain, To breathe, to move, to sleep?âIf haply sleep, Calm death-like sleep, will close my aching eyes, Wearied with watching through the live-long day Yon towering heights, upheaved by hate and envy. [Alphonso and his troop seen at a distance among the heights; when he disappears, she stretches her arms towards the heights. Ha! have ye shut him from my view for ever? Arm, arm your terrible brows with darker terrors, If ye would awe my soul, or bar the way To my fond wishes. LAILA. Said'st thou thy fond wishes? My Amazilia, wert thou not betrothed To brave Houaco? AMAZILIA. I have wept Houaco, In battle slain. LAILA. And shall another fill The heart where brave Houaco wont to reign? AMAZILIA. What have the dead to do with this sad heart? I held Houaco dear from earliest years, For that he would prevent my childish wishes, And still was blest if Amazilia smiled. It was a thing of habit, as we prize Whate'er may to our pleasure minister. It did not fill the heart, but I was tranquil, And nothing knew of these high hopes, these thoughts Aspiring, restless, wild, tumultuous, That make our pent up vale, our abject life, Our brutish ignorance, and slothful ease, So irksome to my soul. LAILA. Oh, Amazilia! 'Tis a distemper'd fancy thus misleads thee. Are we not taught that disembodied spirits, In sweet perpetual change of song and dance, Float joyous; or in flowery meads recline, Now slumbering, or now waking to light labours That make repose more grateful?âSay, my friend, Live we not even so? and is this irksome? AMAZILIA. Yes, to a mind that would aspire so high As fellowship of thought with himâthat would With him share toil and danger!âYes, to one Who would with him enlighten,âbless a people,â And, dying, leave a name that might not perish! Come with me to our cabinâthou shalt learn All that thy friend would wish, would hope, would dare. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Governor's Palace at Panama. Pedrarias and his Court at a grand feast, Alphonso by his father's side. Shouts are heard as from the people rejoicing around the palace. The guests rise with goblets in their hands to welcome Alphonso. PEDRARIAS. Thanks, thanks, my friends and fellows in renown! That ye who shared my dangers and my toils, Should, with such heartfelt brotherhood, partake My private joy, to me is doubly grateful: Our infant state on these fair-conquer'd shores Thrives but by brotherhood thus firmly knit. What yet remains were as a healthful pastime To banish sluggish ease. 'Tis but to sweep, From these our fruitful plains, the native hordes That still infest them.âWhat says my Alphonso? ALPHONSO (shudders, and starts from his reverie). My honour'd father! in this o'ercharged breast A thousand feelings strive for mastery. I would control my wayward thoughts, and worthily Express my thanks to these our noble friends. [He rises, and bows with a goblet in his hand. LOPEZ. The holiday thy glad return has made In Panama, were idle revelry, Unworthy of its cause, if mark'd alone By clamorous shouts. A nobler game, Alphonso, Should seal our joys with blood! PEDRARIAS. It is well said! [The shouts without are repeated. Don Gusman, bear our oft repeated thanks Once more to the glad throng without, I pray; Go thou and give them fair dismissal.âNow [Rising. In this last cup, my friends, I pledge you all. [All rise and drink. 'Twere tedious to repeat my grateful thoughts. The evening closes fast; and, ere I rest, The cares of state demand a thoughtful hour. [They begin to move off with ceremony, Pedrarias comes forward. Conduct Don Lopez to the gate, my son. [Exeunt Alphonso and Lopez. No longer shall your boiling spirits chafe Within these walls, my friends. The means are mine To trace the savage hordes to their last refuge. Visions of conquest on your slumbers wait! My valiant Gomez, Carlos, and Alvarez; And youâand youâmy brave companions all! Pass without compliment.âSweet rest attend you! [Exeunt with proper ceremony. Pedrarias remains in deep thought. Gusman returns. GUSMAN. Methinks, my lord, while with such general joy All Panama has welcomed Don Alphonso, Some secret care has prey'd upon your mind, Checking the tide of a fond father's gladness. PEDRARIAS. True, Gusman, true; greatness has heavy cares. Those savages, who rather than submit To slavery, would sullen die despairingâ Say, have they suffer'd torture? GUSMAN. No, my lord. Pardon that still the rebel natives live. Tortures avail'd us nothing.âWe desisted. PEDRARIAS. Perdition! shall they live who brave my power? Why am I not obey'd? GUSMAN. If vanquish'd foes We daily slaughter thus, where shall we find The slaves required to dig the precious ore? PEDRARIAS. Ye have been slack. New tortures shall compel These slothful slaves to ply their sun-bask'd limbs For conquerors.âLet them be rack'dâAway! GUSMAN. My lord, 'tis useless now. Zamori's voice, Their fellow slave, Zamori's, has prevail'd. PEDRARIAS. Zamori, say'st thou? GUSMAN. Yes, with earnest prayer, He sued to parley with his countrymen, Unheard by me. PEDRARIAS. Thou didst not sure consent? GUSMAN. I did, my lord. But was not distant far, And something caught of what Zamori urged. He spoke of patienceâof some distant hopeâ A hope full sweetâsome good inestimable, However dearly purchased. There I lost His farther speech among the mingling sounds. Their stubborn spirits on the instant yielded: They weptâthey gnash'd their teeth, when, sudden, he First snatch'd a mattock, and with lusty stroke Open'd the soil. All follow'd eagerly, With bleeding wounds inflicted by the lash, Or limbs disjointed by the rack.â'Twas piteous! PEDRARIAS. Gusman, thou wert of my all-conquering band. I little thought to see thee heave the sigh For these dull clods of earth.âThou mov'st my scorn. [He paces the stage, ruminating. And would Zamori move his brutish fellows To serve their master? What might be his motive? Proud, uncomplaining, melancholy, stern, I oft have mark'd this Indian's lofty mien; And (for his carriage still rebuked my spirit) I added e'en indignity to torture. As rocks that from the daily whelming tide Rear the unalter'd brow, he bore himself! It was his firmness taught them to resist, And is it he who schools them now to yield? GUSMAN. My lord, released of late from servile chains, Nearer your person he has been advanced. This gentler treatment in a noble natureâ PEDRARIAS. 'Twas but the nearer to observe his bearing. There is a savage greatness in Zamori That should awake suspicion. Much he may, Swaying the minds of all his fellows thus. GUSMAN. Indeed, my lord, the slave has well deserved. He will be faithful. PEDRARIAS. Faithful he shall be! My eye is on him.âBut far other cares Engross my mind.âHast thou observed Alphonso? Can a few weeks have changed his very nature? Musing he sits, and frowns as fancy works, Or if I question him, he speaks as though Each word involved some mighty consequence. GUSMAN. Perchance the thought of those who shared his sports, And perish'd 'mong the desert wilds, may still Hang heavy on his heart, and cloud his brow. PEDRARIAS. I know not what to think, nor what to fear. âBut thou retire, my friend, and charge Zamori To seek my son, Alphonso, ere he rest, And say I wait his coming in my chamber. His father there would give the rein to nature, And breathe a blessing on his son restored. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. The Governor's Ante-chamber. Alphonso and Houaco enter in conversation. ALPHONSO. Thee, most of all, Zamori, save my father, I joy to see again. Yet thou alone Hast not once deign'd to smile on my return. HOUACO. Joy is a stranger to Zamori's breast! [Retiring slowly, and fixing his eyes on Alphonso, who looks kindly after him, then advances towards his father, who comes from an inner apartment. PEDRARIAS. My son! my loved Alphonso! shall I own That I am almost weary of these loud Tumultuous rejoicings? though for thee, And thy return glad Panama thus maddens. Nay, thou art weary too, and spiritless. ALPHONSO. The joy to see my father and my friends Has something of a tender, serious cast, That rather might to silent tears incline Than these wild revellings. PEDRARIAS. Were tenderness The character of my Alphonso's joy, He were not thus dark, guarded, hesitating, Whene'er a father's fondness prompts th'inquiry Of all that has befallen. ALPHONSO. I will tell all That may import a father. How the chase Of the swift lama, and the fiercer bison, Led on thy thoughtless son, and his young band, The partners of his sports, through trackless woods, O'er mountains, rocks, and wilds, till, lost their course, O'erspent with toil, dispersed, a prey to famineâ The natives of those unknown deserts found, Surrounded, seized, and bound thy son. PEDRARIAS. Bound thee! Pedrarias' son bound by these savages! Ha! they shall dearly rueâ ALPHONSO. Nay, shall they rue The noble pity lavish'd upon one Of the fell raceâ (Aside, checking himself.) But silence, my rash tongue! (Aloud.) Their generous leader knew thy son, and loosed him! He raised, embraced me, bade me say from himâ [Again checking himself. His looks strike terror!âThe good Indian's words Would but embitter whom they might not move To emulate his gentle deeds. PEDRARIAS. E'en now Mark how your speech is brokenâhow you start, And shift, as 'twere some guilty thought appall'd you. Their chief?âsay, was he a Cacique? (Aside.) Could he, The bold, the patient, persevering savage, Capana?âWould the fierce Thelasco do it? No, no. It must be one who knows my power, And thus would win my favour; but not one Who has so felt that power who would release him. (Aloud.) Where lurks the savage chieftain with his horde? Whence com'st thou? ALPHONSO. From among a generous race! Nature's free children! By her special love Guarded from ill! Blest in their simpleness, To avarice they hold no fatal lure! Rich but in worth! Oh, sacred be their peace! [With joy and tenderness. Thou didst lament a son, and he is here! Is't not enough thy once loved son restored? [Throwing himself on his bosom. PEDRARIAS (putting him from him coldly). 'Tis not enough, if thus my son return Alter'd, estranged,âhaply with savages Leagued to betrayâ ALPHONSO. Oh, check thy cruel speech; Or if thou canst suspect my loyalty, Treat me as one attainted; fasten fetters On thy son's guiltless limbs, within a dungeon Cast him, and prefer thy accusation. What is my crime, my father? PEDRARIAS. Disobedience To the vicegerent of thy king, young man, And to thy father. ALPHONSO. Load me then with chainsâ Proclaim me traitorâsend me thus to Spain: Were it not better to be falsely branded, Than in my secret bosom feel the sting He needs must feel who can indeed betray? PEDRARIAS. Ungracious boy! and is it thus I find thee? What tortures shall my just revenge devise For him who robs me of my son?âThe savage! ALPHONSO. Is he the savage who feels others' woes? Who breaks the captive's bonds, and bids him live? Is he the savage who forgives his foe, And renders good for ill?âPardon, methinks He is the Christian! PEDRARIAS (confounded). (Aside.) I have gone too farâ I will try gentler means. (Aloud.) A Christian, say'st thou? And has thy friend embraced our holy faith? ALPHONSO. The Christian's deeds are his. PEDRARIAS. Then as a brother I'll fold the generous Christian to my bosom! I was too warm, my child; my spirit brook'd not A heathen should have held my son in bondage, Nor own'd the debt of gratitude to one Bending at idols' shrines, with rites abhorr'd. ALPHONSO. Pardon, my father, if I have offended. Oh! now I feel I am thy son again, For now thou look'st on thy Alphonso kindly, As in those days of childish happiness, When, from the heavy cares of state retired, Thou would'st assume the boy, and share his sports. PEDRARIAS. Oh yes; and I would thank the Indian chief That he restores my boy, as in those days, Simple, ingenuous, obedient, duteous! ALPHONSO (earnestly). And art thou grateful to the gentle Indian? And would'st thou prove it? PEDRARIAS (with impatience). Yes, I wouldâI would. ALPHONSO (taking his hand affectionately). He and his friends ask but to be forgotten. PEDRARIAS. Nay, nay; thou would'st not that my miser heart, Thankless and cold, should hoard its selfish joy. Come, boy, come, guide me to the Indian Christian, And let me lock him in a friend's embrace; The debt were painful should I nought dispense Of good, for all the mighty good received. ALPHONSO. And what canst thou dispense to one above The idle wants of pride? A little maize Feasts him, the dimpling brook allays his thirst; The palm-tree bowers his bed of reeds, and forms His canopy of state; the bank beneath, Gorgeous in nature's 'broidery, his throne; His empire, in a people's love, is vast: The God he servesâwith rites however rudeâ A God of Mercy, and how truly serves, Thou know'st. PEDRARIAS (impatient). 'Tis wellâyet nam'st thou not thy friend,â Thy Christian friend,ânor tell'st me his abode. ALPHONSO. I cannot. I beseech you, urge it not. PEDRARIAS (resuming his anger). By thy allegiance, I command thee tell me. ALPHONSO (with firmness). I owe my king th'allegiance of a subject: My services are hisâmy swordâmy life! But there's a secret rectitude within, Stamp of the soul free-born, that will not own Control from aught of earth; nor can a king Command me that I act the villain's part. PEDRARIAS. Ha! dost thou brave me thus in every way? Leagued with the rebel natives to defy My delegated power! with impious foot Trampling on nature's first, most sacred tie Of filial duty! [Paces the stage in great agitation. Yesâhow I have loved thee Thou know'st, ungrateful boy!âbut IâI, too, Alphonso, can be firm. If, on the moment, Thou answer not to all I shall demand, I banish thee for ever from my sight, Doom thee to wander, with a father's curse, Among the savages thou hast preferr'd To him who gave thee being. ALPHONSO. Oh, forbear! Reverse the dreadful sentence thou hast pass'd, Or take my worthless life. PEDRARIAS. Nor fancy thou I cannot hunt the natives down, and sweep them From earth, if thou assist not. Would'st attempt To shield the pensile warbler from the swoop Of the huge condor that has mark'd his prey? Thou know'st what I can do when simply led, Like other men, by thirst of fair renown, But hast not mark'd Pedrarias' dread career When urged by sense of wrongâby strong revenge! Hadst thou but trusted to a father's heart, It might have pleaded for the man who spared thee. Look to it now.âThouâthou would'st have it so. 'Twill soon be proved who is most powerful, Or thou to saveâor I to crush a foe. [Going. ALPHONSO (clinging to him). Oh stay! my father, stay!âBehold my breastâ Yes, let my blood atone his fault who spared it, And thus made gratitude a crime. PEDRARIAS. Away! Thou know'st how best to prove thy gratitude: It rests with thee to save thy friend. ALPHONSO. Then hear me. But firstâOh, swear thou never wilt molest His peace, nor seek his place of refugeâSwearâ [Aside, perceiving Capana's token. What am I doing?âCome, thou sacred pledge, Rouse, in this trying hour, my sinking courage! [Aloud, with resignation and firmness. I am resolved, and bow me to my fate! Farewell, my father! PEDRARIAS. Then my curse be on thee! Fly an offended father's presence, rebel! Hide thee in caverns, far from haunt of man, Or, in dread loneliness, bleak deserts roam, Where hope is dead, where pity may not find thee, Where sound of life is none, nor answering echo Gives back thy groan in horrid fellowship! Thy father's heart for ever casts thee off! ALPHONSO. Guiltless I go.âBut when destruction follows, As sure it will, e'en thou, though late, may'st prove A father's anger cannot last for ever. [Exit. PEDRARIAS. Away! nor think to lull my just resentment. Foil'd in the object of my glorious laboursâ Braved by my childâTold by a beardless boy The brutish savage was the better Christian!â Yes, he shall drain repentance' bitter cup E'en to the dregs!âAway, parental weakness! I will know where the native hordes are hived. Ten years of bloodshed and of toil are lost, If in their fastnesses secure they breed, And swarm forth on us.âBut the meansâ (Calls off the stage). Hoa, Gusman! Enter Gusman. GUSMAN. My gracious lord, what has befallen? Alphonso In strange disorderâ PEDRARIAS. From my presence banish'd, Name not the traitor. GUSMAN. Has he not declared Where rally from defeat the natives? PEDRARIAS. No; With obstinate defiance he persisted, Nor would betray his friend, the gentle Indian, The Christian, as it seems.âHa, baffled thus! I have it, GusmanâHis pretended faith Shall prove their bane.âBanish'd, he sure will seek His Indian friendsâMy spies are skill'dâ GUSMAN. Yet think, My lord; each danger, he so late has 'scaped, Besets Alphonso in his pathless way, And doubly foil'd if aught of ill befall. PEDRARIAS. Ha! doubly foil'd?â'tis true.âBut how secure From perilâand yet free his will perverse To follow, unsuspecting of the snare?â GUSMAN. The slave Zamori; you have proved him faithful; He has done you service since his chains were lighten'd. PEDRARIAS. Yes, as the native tames the baneful snake, And bids him wind in glossy folds, around His limbs, innocuous, extracting first The tooth beneath whose fang the poison lurksâ So to my service the proud slave's subdued. GUSMAN. And more; your son affects him, for that once From death Zamori rescued him, unconscious; He may again avert impending illâ PEDRARIAS. And guide his steps; for, led by nature's self, The slave will find, instinctive, their retreat. His very love will give them to my vengeance! Thanksâthanks, my friend! I hold Zamori's faith, For well he knows that thousands of his fellows Will bleed if he but swerve. 'Twill doâ'twill do. Go, bear my will to my disloyal son; With hopes of future favour win Zamoriâ Nay, I, myself, will school him to my purpose. And, mark meâseek thou Perezâsend him hither. To-morrow's sun shall find my plans matured For future conquest, and for future glory. [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. A Court of the Palace. A distant View of the BayâEvening; the Moon rising. Houaco enters slowly from one side. HOUACO. His wond'rous tale has roused each recollection That bids me live, while it makes life so bitter. Oh, my poor countrymen! and ye, dear objects Of my sad, secret thoughts!âNo, nothingânothing,â Can ever slacken memory's strong hold! [Alphonso enters from the other side, with folded arms, and lost in thought. Alone! I will accost him.âDon Alphonso! ALPHONSO (starting from his reverie). Approach, Zamori, for thou art an Indian. Haply the sight of thee may soothe my soul! I am o'erwhelm'd by a stern father's curse For keeping faith with men like thee, Zamori. HOUACO. By men like me faith given ne'er was broken. ALPHONSO. My faith was given to one so great!âso noble! To one, whose spirit seems an emanation From him whom darkling he adores unknown! Yes, given to one, whose gentle sway of love Is stamp'd by Mercy, and upheld by Justice! HOUACO. Yet Justice upon Mercy's bosom slept When the wrong'd Indian held Pedrarias' son, And loosed his bonds! (With suspicion). If so indeed it were? ALPHONSO. Oh! that I might disburthen my full heart In any human breast!âI would choose thine. Ere I departed from my father's court, Thou know'st I woo'd thy friendship, though in vain. HOUACO. I am a slaveâthe slave can never be The freeman's friend. ALPHONSO. Not so. Can twisted bands, Or fire-wrought iron, though they bind the limbs, Subdue the free-born spirit?âThou art noble. I would no other friend. HOUACO. I am a native Of this fair land, that reeks beneath my foot With the dear blood of those I wont to love, Shed by thy father's unrelenting hand! And shall my soul communion hold with thine? ALPHONSO. Thou didst, with friendship's own unshrinking hand, Unwreathe the hooded snake that round my neck Had wound him in my sleep! HOUACO. 'Tis true, I did. But first it chanced, when, as unskill'd, I strain'd The servile oar, with muscles all unused To the strait tension, and the rapid current Of Oronoko seem'd to mock my toil, Thy father bade his creatures urge with stripes My fainting strengthâ (Aside, mastering himself). Be stillâbe still, my soul! Thou took'st my place, as 'twere in youthful sport, And lustily didst buffet with the stream, While on the oar, amid thy playful speech, Fell pity's tear! ALPHONSO. Then why refuse, Zamori, The fellowship I court?â'tis nature's self Draws kindred spirits, and Pedrarias' son Is dear to one like theeâa noble Indian! [Takes Capana's token from his bosom, and gazes on it. Thou sacred pledge! HOUACO. That pledge! or do I dream? That sacred pledge! [Seizing Alphonso roughly. Speakâspeak, Alphonso, speak! Or I will tear the secret from thy soul!â Did he who gave thee liberty, give that? ALPHONSO (putting him away haughtily). Must thou, too, question with imperious tone? I have withstood a father's sacred claim! (Aside.) âBreathe not the sounds even in an Indian's ear,â He said.âI must mislead his eagerness. (Aloud.) I found the bauble! HOUACO (with trembling anxiety). And a mangled corse Beside it! or, haply, scatter'd bones, that bleach'd In the rude blast!âOh! on my knees, I beg, Tell me the fatal spot, that I may gather Each honour'd relic to my broken heart! ALPHONSO (kindly). Pardon, Zamori, that I may not tell By what dear right this valued pledge is mine. HOUACO (shuddering with horror). Ha! thou hast slain him, and dost bear his spoils! ALPHONSO (with delight). No, no.âHe lives! he lives, who gave me this. But wherefore dost thou strain thy eyeballs thus, With short convulsive heavings?âWho art thou? HOUACO (recollecting himself). I am thy father's slave. ALPHONSO. But ere these chains, (My heart prophetic throbs) who wert thou?âsay! HOUACO. This bosom holds its secret too. ALPHONSO. Oh, no! It holds no secret mine does not partake! Nature's strong impulse bids me clasp thy hand, And call theeâbrave Houaco! HOUACO (in ecstacy). Yes, 'twas he! 'Twas he himself who spared thy life! ALPHONSO. Thy father, Capana, gave me life and liberty, Thou brother of my love! and gave me this. [They embrace. He bade me not reveal to living being The place of his retreat. His son, he thought, Was number'd with the dead. HOUACO. And so he is! The slave Zamori lives. ALPHONSO. Capana's son Thou art, and shalt be!âYes, I fly to claim The free enlargement of Capana's son! HOUACO. Oh stay, rash youth! ALPHONSO. Alas! the sudden joy Had blotted from my thought all former ill; My vowâmy cruel father's angerâall! By gratitude debarr'd from grateful deeds, Oh, am I not, Houaco, most accursed? To know my benefactor wastes his days In sorrow, and thus,âthus to hold the means Of full requital!âhold his happiness As 'twere within my grasp, nor dare dispense it! HOUACO. Young man, misfortune has not school'd thy spirit, Unmoved, to suffer; to the present senseless, Thy very being forward borne, with purpose Intense, deep fix'd, till years bring on the hour Of retribution, great as was the wrong. ALPHONSO. Rear'd in gay luxury, my friend, my youth Sought but the pleasures of the passing day; But when I mark'd thy calm, disdainful, brow Smiling in tortures, felt how great the conquer'd!â The conquerors how little!âthen my mind Aspired to emulate the man I honour'd. That man the son of him who set me freeâ To free him be henceforth my soul's strong purpose! By Heaven, it cannot be, that he, the father Who to my infant prayer would yield with smiles, Should now relentlessâ HOUACO. If he could relent, Capana must not look on these gall'd wrists: He has wept me, deadâhe must not find new tears To weep his son enslaved! ALPHONSO (eagerly). A slave no longer! For thou with me from Panama shalt fly, Escaped from chainsâ HOUACO. Might I escape, I would not. The tyrant's vengeance would with tenfold fury Fall on my fellow-captives!âNo, I would not; For while I stand between Pedrarias' rigour And the poor suffering few his rage has spared, Methinks it is a last sad duty, owed By lost Houaco to his father's people! ALPHONSO. Thou noble spirit!âThen 'tis mine alone To seek Capana, and with him concert To break thy bondage. Thou, meantime, my friend, Wear this, it will recall his honour'd image. [Giving him Capana's token. HOUACO. No, wear it thou! for no remembrancer Houaco needs of his poor wandering father, His butcher'd people, and his wasted country! Enter Gusman. GUSMAN. I have sought thee, Don Alphonso, through the palace, The bearer of thy father's will. [Houaco retiring. Nay, stay, Zamori! thy good services are graced: 'Tis thine to follow on Alphonso's fortunes. Yet one night more within these walls ye rest: Ere dawn, togetherâ ALPHONSO. Together, Gusman! Thanks, My gracious father! e'en in anger kind! (To Houaco). The heavens thou see'st on holy friendship smile! Come then, thou brother of my heart! The heights Upheaved before us frown in untamed grandeur, Our ample heritage! th'o'erarching skies Our mutual roof! for bolts and bars, our faith! Then not in lonely deserts shall we roam; For, with a friend, the wilderness is peopled! Nor in throng'd cities, nor in soul-less courts, Is known the full communion of free thought Man finds with man in native liberty! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Wild Mountain Scenery. A Palm-tree in the Foreground, with Fruits placed beneath it. Alphonso, Houaco. HOUACO. Oh should Pedrarias trace our steps, my friend! The very thought strikes with a death-like chill Through all my frame, killing each thought of joy! Thy father's looks and words when he dismiss'd me, Guardedâmysterious! No, 'twas not blind rage That banish'd a loved son, so lately found! ALPHONSO. Thy boding mind too idly shapes vain terrors. Have we not, wandering thus, pursued a course Most intricate? It were impossible! Ravaged by conquest, the unpeopled plains Are silent! Though dark-brow'd, these rocks are friendly: Nor hostile e'en the beasts of prey, shunning Our aspect strange with disregard, not fear. There is no guile in the primeval haunts Of nature, still inviolate by man. Then think, these heights o'erpass'd, how will thy heart Bound at the sight of the green vale!âthy father! And her thou lov'stâthy Amazilia! thereâ (Aside) Yes, I will speak her name without emotion. She is my friend's! Away the impious thought That would repine! HOUACO. Hast thou e'er lov'd, Alphonso? Oh no! or thou hadst known love's doubtsâlove's fearsâ That war with joy, unwonted inmate here! And then to meet my Amazilia's eye, Ere noble deeds efface the blasting traces Deep stamp'd by slavery!âthis is bitterness! ALPHONSO. Be cheer'd, and from thy fancy drive these thoughts, For much they wrong thy gentle Amazilia. HOUACO. ThanksâI will strive to think so. Now resume we Our search for the deep-rifted rock which gives Admittance to the valley. Friend, we hold, That on these awful heights, Illapa stores His vengeful thunders. The stern God himself Rent the eternal barrier to admit A fugitive cacique! ALPHONSO. 'Tis strange, Houaco, We should have sought in vain the deep ravine Since early dawn, and now the sun is high. Methought I noted each o'erhanging cliff, And yawning gulf, as forth your people led me. HOUACO. 'Twere best despatch that thou the eastern ridge, And I the western, traverse. ALPHONSO. 'Tis well thought. Here part we then awhileâand here ere noon Meet we again. Beneath this palm, the fruits Thou, provident, hast gather'd as we journey'd, Shall furnish forth our banquet. HOUACO (going). Warily Observe thy course. ALPHONSO. And do thou call, my friend, From time to time, that we may not be sunder'd. [Exeunt severally. Enter Amazilia and Laila. AMAZILIA. Oh, Laila! I must lay me down and die, Such weariness and faintness overcome me: My trembling limbs refuse to bear their burthen. LAILA. Why didst thou press our little store on me, Refusing still to share it? Why preserve Thy Laila, if to live bereft of thee? Alas! our happy vale! Why, Amazilia, Could'st thou no longer taste our blameless life? AMAZILIA. Go ask the bird, why from his wicker prison, Where unsought plenty courts him ere he hunger, He seeks to escape. LAILA. A prison? Amazilia. AMAZILIA. Oh, 'twas a narrow prison to my mind! My thoughts would range, as the young Christian led, Beyond the bounds of timid ignorance. LAILA. And dost thou call it ignorance to enjoy The season's gifts in peace and innocence, Secure from the fierce storms that wreck'd our country? How lovely Nature in her gentler mood! It is her pearly dew, her noiseless shower, That rear the maize, that swell the cocoa's nut, Which with untoil'd and careless hand we crop. AMAZILIA. Dull, vacant easeâinsipid samenessâLaila! That wake not glowing thoughts, nor wing the soul To soar above the brute creation round us. The hurricane, majestic in its terrors, Resistless sweeps our orange groves away, And marks its awful course by desolation; Yet roused, as we contemplate power so vast, We bend before the spirit of the storm In worship, we forget to pay, when nature Serenely smiles around. But I would rest. LAILA. Beneath this tree the bank is clothed with moss: Here find repose, while I, among the thickets, Search for cool berries, or a gushing spring: Ere long I will return. See! rest thy head Against the shaded trunk: now, art thou well? Kind slumbers visit thee! I will not tarry. [Exit. AMAZILIA (alone). Alas! I cannot rest. My fever'd brain! Oh that my Laila may but find a spring! To lave my burning hands were some relief. I am not well here. Yonder palm, methinks, Affords more ample shade. [She removes to the palm. What see I here? Bananas, yams, and juicy gourds!âHo, Laila! Whence comes this boon? Ah! I bethink me now, Alphonso said, the God of Mercy watched O'er all his creatures! not a sparrow fell Without his bidding! [Kneeling. Oh! Alphonso's God! Accept my thanks! Enter Alphonso. ALPHONSO. I heard a soft complainingâ This way the sound! Eternal Providence! What angel form before me kneels? 'tis she! AMAZILIA (starting up). Is it an airy vision?âor art thou The god, whose hand beneficent has placed These fruits before me, lest I sink in death? [She staggers towards him, and sinks into his arms. ALPHONSO. Help, heaven! My Amazilia's passing soul Flutters on her pale lip!âSo fair! so sacred! Perforce these guilty armsâ [She half recovers, and gazes on him. She breathes! she lives! Why dost thou gaze so wildly? 'tis Alphonso! AMAZILIA (wildly). It cannot be that thou of kindred earth Wast framed! Thou hast the power to save from death! Thou hast watched o'er me! Thou, unseen, hast led My steps o'er yon proud heights that barr'd my way! Thy airâthy voiceâallâall! betray thy nature! ALPHONSO. Oh be more calm! These wand'ring thoughts affright me. AMAZILIA (more wildly). Thou art the spirit that wings the middle air In gentle breezes; with assuasive hand Turning aside Illapa's The God of Thunder. angry bolt, That it may rive the haughty mountain's crest, And spare the lowly vale! ALPHONSO. When last I saw thee, Thou hadst abjured these idols, false, and vain, Offspring of fear and ignorance! AMAZILIA (more impassioned). Then, sure, Thou art the hope, the love, the gentle pity Thou told'st me of, embodied in a form Not of earth's mould! Thus kneelingâ [As she is about to kneel he raises her. ALPHONSO. Rise! oh rise! I shudder at thy error, Amazilia. Am I not he whose life thy goodness saved? Should I not rather kneel to thee?âand yet Thou see'st I bend not! Said'st thou not thyself, When pleading for me to the good cacique, That by thy lips the God of Mercy spoke? And might not he, by my unconscious hand, Before thee place these fruits? Human am I, And frail. Too well I feel it! (aside). But sayâWhy To these rude wilds, and to their ruder tenants, (If such there be), thy virtue all unguarded, And high estate, thouâinconsiderate!â Commit'st thy charms? AMAZILIA. And have I, then, done ill? ALPHONSO. That were not possible! butâthy companions? AMAZILIA. I left the valley with no friend save Laila. ALPHONSO. Oh heaven! and wherefore didst thou so? rash maid! AMAZILIA. It was grown hateful, youth. Within my breast Something still whisper'd, if I could escape, I should once moreâI pray you, pardon me! ALPHONSO. Dear Amazilia!âwhat is thy offence? AMAZILIA. Said'st thou not âdear?â Oh then thou wilt forgive! ALPHONSO. What is this mystery? I pray thee speak! Can Amazilia e'er offend Alphonso? Did she not soothe his sufferings? save his life? Oh prove the gratitude too big for utterance! AMAZILIA. And wilt thou grant whatever I may ask? ALPHONSO. I will! for Amazilia cannot ask What purest angels would not smiling grant! [She throws herself at his feet with the wildest enthusiasm. AMAZILIA. Then at thy feet I humbly ask this boonâ That I may follow thee through toil, through danger, In winter's storms, beneath the burning skies, In sickness tend theeâwhen thou sorrowest, weep; Lull thee when weary, o'er thy slumber watch, Wait on thy every lookâfrom thy lips learn Of heavenly wisdom, goodness infinite; And soar in thought as much above the sphere That once was mine, as when in night's hush'd hour I hung upon thy words! ALPHONSO. No more! no more! Oh, let me fly for ever from thy sight, Thou fair enthusiast! ere a guilty thought Pollute my faith, and wrong my chosen friend! AMAZILIA. Whom should'st thou wrong? I am an orphan, free From every tie. ALPHONSO (in an agony). Oh no! thou art not free! HOUACO (at a distance). Hoa! Alphonso! ALPHONSO. That voice! Heard'st thou that voice? I do beseech thee, generous Amazilia! If thou would'st save me from despair, from death, Forget the words that now have pass'd thy lips! These shapings of distemper'd fancy, trust me, Thy better reason will disown. Oh yes, Thou art o'er wearied! [Takes her hand as she seems violently agitated. This hand burns with fever! HOUACO (nearer). Alphonso! hoa! ALPHONSO. It is Houaco's voice! Capana's son! my bosom's chosen brother! Houaco! hoa!âI pray thee be composed. Enter Houaco. Amazilia faints, and Houaco stands thunderstruck. HOUACO. Ha! Amazilia in Alphonso's arms! ALPHONSO (supporting AMAZILIA). Approach, Houaco! I have found thy spouse Thus spent with travel, and with hunger fainting. Support her thou, and I will bring the fruits, Our only store. [Houaco receives her from Alphonso. HOUACO. Oh! my loved Amazilia! And can it be thy heavenly form these arms, These trembling, these poor, chain-gall'd, arms, support? And shall thy opening eyes behold a slave, In thy youth's promised husband, Amazilia! Wilt thou not spurn him? [She opens her eyes languidly, looks at him, and feebly struggles to get from him. Shuddering she would break From my unworthy hold!âCome thou, Alphonso! For e'en in death she shrinks from my embrace. Do thou support her. [Alphonso supports, and Houaco retires dejectedly. AMAZILIA (opening her eyes, and finding herself in his arms). I am free, Alphonso! O'er the wide world I may at pleasure roam: Who, who shall stay me? ALPHONSO. Oh! her thoughts are fever'd! These idle words are fancy's sickly coinage! AMAZILIA. Methinks, indeed, I am about to die! Then wherefore aught disguise of all I feel? Houaco, I rejoice that thou still livest! Thy presence will restore Capana's peace. Oh may ye both be bless'd! but 'tis not given To wretched Amazilia, if she live, To witness, or to share, your happiness! HOUACO. I knew the high-born maid would thus reject One who had been a slave! AMAZILIA. Nay, dear Houaco, Think not thou art degraded in my eyes By any chance of war. No, dearer far Thy sufferings have made thee; and my heart Will ever own for thee a sister's love. HOUACO. âA sister's love!â Why should'st thou say âa sister's?â Thou art betroth'd to me! Canst thou not promise The love a wife should know? AMAZILIA. My wayward fate Will have it otherwise. HOUACO. What mean these words? AMAZILIA (with solemnity). I own the Christian's God! the God of Mercy! Farewell, Houaco! I am dead to thee. [Going. HOUACO (stopping her). And dost thou fly me?âWhither, Amazilia? AMAZILIA (with enthusiasm). I follow where Alphonso leads the way! ALPHONSO (embarrassed). No, she is not herself. Houaco, hear me! HOUACO (after a pause of contending passion). This is no forgery of sickly fancy! I see,âtoo clearly see! Fool that I was To be thus duped! thus led in triumph hither! Thou art a Spaniard! son of fell Pedrarias! And thou canst smile, and flatter, to betray. I was thy father's slave by right of war, But did consent to fellowship with thee: Nor half so low Pedrarias' slave I hold As false Alphonso's friend! ALPHONSO (aside, with effort). (Down, down my rage! Capana's son is to Alphonso sacred!) No, by my soul, 'tis false! 'tis false, Houaco, What thou hast thought. My faith to thee is pure. All lovely as she is, she shall be thine! And never, neverâ AMAZILIA. Hold! Alphonso, hold! I never can be thineâtoo well I know it! My fancy had not yet distinctly formed The daring thought! but following thee, it seem'd I sought the unknown God, whose virtuous lore Thy heaven-instructed lips were wont to teach! Thou may'st refuse my proffered service, youth; But canst not give me to another. Free I amâand will be! HOUACO. Nay, it is well done, Pedrarias' son! to steal from me her faith, And now to spurn the maid! ALPHONSO. To spurn her?âNo. But to my friend! but to Capana's son! To yield what most I prize beneath heaven's cope! AMAZILIA. âTo yield me,â haughty youth! E'en thus our people Will barter for the tame, domestic Lama, Gay colour'd shells, or cocoa nuts, her price. (Turning to Houaco). Of noble bloodâmy father a cacique, Great as thine own, Houaco! Liberty, As thine, my birthright! My free-will I claim, And evermore in solitude will dwell, Secure, self-guarded! For I know to charm The baneful snakeâthe properties have learnt Of herbs salubrious; and the mystic song Is mine, to lull the powers of ill that haunt The mountain caverns, and in storms disport. (To Alphonso). Farewell, Alphonso! proud as thou, no mate, No loved companion shall this bosom own! My fellowship be with the answering rocks; The winds my counsellorsâfor who shall share Those thoughtsâthose hopesâwhich thou, youth, thou alone Who didst inspireâcould'st, worthily, partake? [She sinks exhausted on the bank; Alphonso, terrified, bends anxiously over her. Enter Laila hastily. LAILA. My Amazilia, I have found a brook; The clustering cessus, and papaia fruitâ (Seeing Houaco) But oh! ye pitying heavens! or do I dream, Or do I bow to great Capana's son? HOUACO (putting her away). Leave me, oh leave me! I am nothing, Laila! Haste thee, kind maid, and aid thy sinking friend. Ah see! she faints!âand yet thy services May be, as mine, ungratefulâfor behold! The wily Spaniard o'er his victim bends! [Laila hastens to her assistance, and is anxiously employed about her with Alphonso, without observing Houaco. And are there ills Houaco has not felt? What torture new, and strange, and fierce, is this? Have I not baffled all Pedrarias' rage, And smiled upon him,âas I had been at ease? When pierced with wounds, fainting with loss of blood, While swam all nature in my glassy eyes, And, on my brow, death hung his last cold dews, My spirit still held on its even course! When torn with stripes, (the son of a cacique!) I bore myself as though I felt them not! I wearied out my torturers' cruelty, And thought this iron breast was proof against The touch of human ill. But this! oh! this Awakes a pang so keen! it strikes so home! On chords so tender of the heart! on chords That neither fortitude nor manhood tempers To bear a touch so rude! [After watching them with violent emotion. The smooth-tongued villain! He shall not triumph in my woes! I'll hide me In desert haunts and die!âor rouse my soul To actions worthy of Capana's son! [Exeunt. SCENE II. Deep Caverns that lose themselves in the Distance. Pedrarias, Gusman, and Spaniards. PEDRARIAS. Gusman, it was a dreadful night! Methinks The heavens smile not on our enterprise. Has Perez seen my son? GUSMAN. He has, my lord. Long practised, in their secret haunts, to hunt The natives, he, with matchless skill, has traced The winding way the fugitives pursued. These caves conceal his trusty band. PEDRARIAS. 'Tis well. Our veteran troops where posted? GUSMAN. In the rear, A few hours march, my lord. Refresh'd by rest, Elate with hope, and burning with impatience, They wait their conquering chief to lead them on. PEDRARIAS. Perez, thou said'st e'en now, had seen my son. Summon him, Gusman; I will question him. [Exit Gusman. Thanks that thou yet art safe, my son! What pangs Have I endured, since from a father's presence In wrath I banished thee! Re-enter Gusman with Perez. Good Perez, welcome. Thy skill and diligence have well deserved. How follow'd'st thou Alphonso and the slave? PEREZ. My lord, I traced their steps by many signs: Here, twisted boughs had form'd a hasty bowerâ There, lay remains of fruits; beside the rill, The shells of cocoa nuts had served as goblets. PEDRARIAS. And didst thou see Alphonso? PEREZ. Yes, my lord: But two nights since, Zamori and your son, Beneath a plantain so profoundly slept, That by the moonlight I could dwell a space Distinctly on each feature. PEDRARIAS (aside). Two nights since! How many chances may two nights involve, And two long days that have gone by since then! PEREZ. E'en now, my lord, I saw Zamori. PEDRARIAS (eagerly). How? PEREZ. Beneath dry leaves, within a thicket laid: I scarcely breathed. PEDRARIAS. And by his side Alphonso? PEREZ. Zamori was alone. With alter'd carriage, He ragedâhe beat his breastâand, desperate, On the cold earth he flung himself. PEDRARIAS. Spoke he? PEREZ. Some words he mutter'd, and methought the tones Were those of deadly angerâmenaces, As though of vengeance. PEDRARIAS. Tones of anger!âmenaces! (Aside) Gods! can the slave I deign'd to favour?âYes, A Spaniard, and Pedrarias' son, might well Become the object of Zamori's vengeance! Retire, good Perez. Gusman, I will follow: In th'inner cave we will concert our measures. [Exeunt Gusman and Perez. Ungrateful, wayward boy! Thou little know'st How still the father hangs about this heart! I would not lose thee, noâfor all the wealth Of either world! But wherefore take th'alarm? The slave's hand raised against the conqueror's son! He durst notânoâthe thought is idleâvain. Besides, Alphonso had his sword!âNo moreâ These fears might better suit a trembling mother, Than one, who, heaven commission'd, seeks new worlds, Sets on their shores his foot, and stamps them his! [He follows Gusman and Perez into the further caverns.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The first Mountain Scenery. Alphonso, Amazilia. ALPHONSO. Forget me, hate me, lovely Amazilia; And let me fly, and yield me to despair. [Going. AMAZILIA. Whither?âWhither? ALPHONSO. Where I may never more Behold thy fatal charms! AMAZILIA (with desperation). Nay, if thou dost, I will not live!âNo, by yon Heaven, I will not! An Indian knows a thousand ways to death, No death so frightful as were life without thee. ALPHONSO (after gazing on her earnestly). I dare not trust my eyesâthy every look Exerts a several destructive power! AMAZILIA. Kill me, if I am in my nature hurtful! Kill me! but fly me notâYet wherefore hurtful? My heart goes forth to every thing that lives With kindliest will. I would not crush the reptile E'en though it stung me. Am I then more cruel Than venom'd reptiles? for they spare their kind, But I, thou say'st, injure whom most I love. ALPHONSO. Nay, nay; it is involuntary wrong!â Alas for poor Houaco! slavery, tortures, Were powerless to dash his bosom's firmness. Thy scorn alone could break that noble spirit. AMAZILIA. I do not scorn Houaco. Must I wed One whom I cannot loveâas now I feel This heart can love? (With enthusiasm). Oh yes! it would revere Its object, as above the human race; And, hanging on his words, his looks, would catch A new soul, and new hopes, and glorious thoughts! ALPHONSO (aside). Oh gratitude! Oh friendship! bar each sense! AMAZILIA. Alas! and can I honour thus Houaco? Returning from the battle, if he bear An hundred scalps of those his hatchet slew; If on his steps, when crown'd with victory, His fellow creatures manacled attend, To bleed before the altars of our gods; Say, shall these eyes, by thee unseal'd to truth, Behold with sympathy that husband's triumph? If thou would'st doom me to a fate like this, Oh! why dispel the darkness of my soul, And break upon me, as Heaven's glorious beam Darts through the mountain chasm, by lightnings rent, Awaking life and joy, where since creation Darkness, and silence, and inaction dwelt? ALPHONSO. Dear, lost enthusiast!âCurse! Oh, curse the hour I led thy glowing fancyâ AMAZILIA. Hold! for mercy! Curse not the gleam of bliss this heart has caught, To sweeten the long life of misery To which thou doom'st it now! (With sudden earnestness). But whence the law?â Haply of some more cruel God than ours Thou hast not told of yet;âfor not of nature The law that bids thee give me to Houaco. ALPHONSO. Friendship, and gratitudeâ AMAZILIA. Hast thou no friendship? Hast thou no gratitude for Amazilia? Must allâall be Capana's and his son's? Thou said'st I saved thy lifeâhave they done more? And do they love thee, honour thee as much? ALPHONSO (after a conflict). Believe me, Amazilia, this poor life Has worth but as thy gift! and for thy sake To lay it down were joy! but thus to live! Oh no! thy sweetness cannotâmust not guess The torturing force stern honesty exerts To rule this breast; for might I loose the curb Of headlong passion, at full bliss to aim, What were it, think'st thou, but to see thee ever, To claim thy tenderness, to call thee mine! AMAZILIA. Thineâthine I am! the fates have will'd it so! 'Tis nature's strong decree! 'tis Heaven's! 'tis virtue's! ALPHONSO. Hold! Hold!âDoes virtue bid us seek delight Reckless of all beside? I to Houaco Have sworn a brother's faithâto him thy father Gave thee!âHe lives! and I, with holy love, Must honour thee as my Houaco's wife! [A pause of consternation. Shall we, who boast of Christian virtues, own A thought, a wish, so selfish, and so base, As our own bliss by his destruction purchased? Nay, is there bliss for them who know remorse? And what remorse were ours! AMAZILIA. No more, Alphonso! Thy awful words confound th'astonish'd sense, Yet woo my trembling soul to higher thoughts Than e'enâthe heaven I dream'dâto live for thee! Sayâwere Iâby such self-devotion, stamp'd A being worthy of thy fellowship? Of thy regard? to thee a kindred spirit? ALPHONSO. Thy matchless virtue were as far above My humbler aim, as are thy matchless charms Above the sum of loveliness dispensed To all thy sex beside; and I should live (If liveâIâmust) to honourâto adore! AMAZILIA. Firm as thyself in virtue's path, Alphonso, Thou shalt admire, and wonder at thy victim. See, at thy feet I welcome wretchedness! [With profound resignation. I am Houaco's wife! ALPHONSO (aside). (Oh! dreadful sounds! 'Tis agony I feel that should be joy!) I thank thee, Amazilia; yes, I thank thee, With fervor, as when pleading for my life Thy angel tongue preserved me!â (Turning from her). Spare me now! Let me not look on thee!âI pray thee go. Thy Laila waits thee, and thy happy lord Claims theeâhis own!â(Stern honour, holy friendship, Blot out the madd'ning thoughts that rise!) (As she approaches meekly). Oh! leave me! I do beseech thee, leave!âin pity leave me! [Amazilia goes submissively and dejectedly. Accept the sacrifice, my benefactor! I, who might fold her to my burning bosom, Yet, for her thousand, thousand glowing charms, Embrace despair! [Throws himself on the bank, then starting up with horror. It is my father's curse, Wretch that I am, pursues me to the end! Shun me, Houaco! Shun me, Amazilia! I bear destruction wheresoe'er I go! With deadly influence, as the baleful mildew, O'er the young harvest of your loves I pass'd, That but for me (the winter fled) had been Fair ripening now beneath a smiling sky. [He sinks on the bank in despair. SCENE II. A different and wilder Part of the Mountains. HOUACO alone. Ye angry Gods, by my forefathers worshipp'd, How terrible ye crowd upon my soul! What spoke your thunders, rolling o'er my head, Through the black vault of night? Your fiery bolt Flashing on the lithe rattlesnake that lay Coil'd at my feet?âThey spoke thy will, Illapa, Demanding thus thy victim at my hands, And imaging, in the insidious serpent, The Spaniard who has stung me to the soul. My father wrong'd thee, vengeful Deity! Of blood, thy due; and I, more guilty still, Won by Alphonso's blandishments, forgot The hate, the deep unconquerable hate, I vow'd to fell Pedrarias' raceâNay, more, Gave him the friendship of an honest heart, And lent my easy ear to his smooth words, While joy and hope won softly on my soul: Joyâthe attendant of the thoughtless child, And hopeâthat waits on fools! [Thelasco and a troop of Indians are seen approaching among the rocks. THELASCO. All powerful Heaven! Or does a wreathing vapour mock my sight, Or art thou from the land of spirits come To warn us of impending ill?âOh stay! Whate'er thou be, thou seem'st Capana's son, And thus my heart acknowledges the semblance. [Bowing down before him. HOUACO (starting from his reverie). Friend of my youth! my father's friend! Thelasco! [Embraces him. How fares it with the good Cacique, Capana? THELASCO. He lives! and in his son restored, is happy. Come, let me lead thee to him. HOUACO. Stay, Thelasco! Oh stay! I am not yet prepared; thou see'st How the firm temper of my soul is shaken! Think not the ills our cruel foes inflicted E'er moved me thus!â'Tis here, Thelasco, here [Beating his breast. It rankles e'en to madness.âYesterdayâ Oh! yesterday!â THELASCO. Forget the pass'd day's ill: Think of to-day! th'auspicious day that brings thee, After two years of sorrow for thy loss, To share our happiness, thy father's gift! HOUACO (not attending to him). Virtues fantastical!âBy Christians dream'd! Ye are vain names! flowers that wreathe the dagger They plunge into our breasts! (To Thelasco, eagerly and wildly). Valour in war, And fortitude that tortures cannot shakeâ Sayâare not these the virtues of the Indian? Revenge, if wrong'd, his duty and his solace? Is it not so, Thelasco? THELASCO (astonished). Surely, so! But wherefore hang dark thoughts upon thy mind When all is joy? Each social bliss awaits thee; A people's welcomeâfriendshipâlove! HOUACO (with a bitter laugh). Ha! ha! [Then falling into his former melancholy. I have no friend, Thelasco!âIdle love Is for the fortunate! THELASCO. As thou shalt be! HOUACO (not attending to him). Had I nor eyes, nor ears? Where were my senses? Did he not falter? did he not turn pale, Oft as I named the maid? And when I told How to my arms, when yet a sportive child, Her dying father gave her, he exclaim'd, âOh! tie indissoluble! sacred!â clasping His trembling hands; then, starting, blush'd, and smiled; And on the sudden all was calm, serene, As smooth hypocrisy's own brow!âFool! fool! [Striking his forehead, and relapsing into his thoughtful posture. THELASCO (alarmed, to the Indians). My friends, the heavy ills our chief has known Prey on his wounded spirit: wild disorder Oft waits on thought intense in noble minds. Bear the glad tidings that Houaco lives To all around. Summon our people straight In joyous bands, with festive song and dance, To welcome home Capana's warlike son. (To Houaco). [The Indians go. In yon deep-bosom'd glen, 'mong beetling rocks, Dwell the surviving few of the young band That follow'd thee in thy first days to battle. There, sorrowing for thy loss, in gloomy caves They hang their idle hatchets, till they hear Thy voice, Houaco! thy awakening voice! Rousing them from their sad inglorious ease, To lead them forth. HOUACO. Ha! there again thou strikest! My youthful band of friends!âOh, hide me from them! They still are free, and on their native mountains Share with the savage of the wilds his prey; They ne'er felt chains!âOh, no! Thelasco, no! 'Tis not the slave must lead the freeman forth! Troops of Indians advance from among the rocks, with festive garlands, &amp;c. CHORUS OF NATIVES. Is the patriot chief restored? He whom India's sons deplored, He who sank on slaughter's field, Where new forms of death appal; He who bade us bleed and fall, Nobly fallâbut never yield! CHOSEN BAND OF WARRIORS. A people's vow Has won our leader from the tomb! His sadden'd brow, Hung with dark affliction's gloom, Shall smile again beneath the victor's meed, And hail! with transport hail! his injured country freed! CHORUS OF NATIVES. Bearing on with hope elate, From his beaming eye flash'd fate! He th'avenger's work began, The spell of panic terror burst; And his daring hatchet first Proved the invader was but man! BAND OF WARRIORS. To yield the breath, And give to dust the mangled frame, This is not death! It is the warrior's birth to fame! On! to the field of glory lead again, And drive the invader back,âback to the guilty main! [The Indians crowd around Houaco with wonder, joy, and affection. LASCALA. Noble Houaco! thy return brings joy, Brings hope, brings life, to every Indian warrior! Bliss to our great Cacique! But IâI, too, Had sons I loved! to war with the invader They follow'd thee. Trembling I ask their fate. HOUACO. Lascala, the brave youth who bore thy name, Beneath his hatchet saw a Spaniard fall, Ere to the land of spirits he was welcomed By his forefathers. LASCALA. Oh! had I died so! [He is lost in grief, while an old woman comes forward. WOMAN. And at thy feet I ask my Zama's fate: Zama, from whose strong arm the arrow sped Unerring in the chase. HOUACO. Nor err'd in war. But the forged thunders of th'invading foe More fatal sped, alas! WOMAN. Ah me, my boy! And shall he never more, at evening's close, Bear homeward from the mountain's side the prey To cheer our cabin hearth? And shall Nayati, His faithful wife Nayati, never moreâ HOUACO. Ha! faithful, say'st thou? Was Nayati faithful? She shall be honour'd above all her sex! Let her be crown'dâbe led in triumph hither! I thought there was no faith in womankind; There is, it seemsâthere isâbut not for meâ Houaco only is to no one dear. THELASCO (aside). How strange his words! LASCALA (with trembling anxiety). But say my Azlan lives; One lives, at least, to close his father's eyes. HOUACO. He livesâ LASCALA. He lives? and follows not thy steps? HOUACO (with bitterness). He lives; and shares the fateâthe bitter fateâ Of great Capana's son. [He bares his wrist, and shows it to Lascala. LASCALA. These marks, Houaco, What may they mean? HOUACO (with the utmost bitterness). Chain'd!âmanacled!âa slave! Capana's son has lived! LASCALA. Say'st thou âhas lived?â And has th'invader bound e'en mighty Death To do his will? Can Death no longer free The man who will not live? HOUACO. To die, old man, Were easy, as 'twere sweet. The very weeds Our careless footsteps bruise, with juices teem Will loose from life. 'Twere but to have refused A little maize, and I had slept the sleep Th'invader could not break: but sweet revenge Had then been lost! Who would not live, Lascala, And shake off death, e'en though within his grasp, Nay, snatch at life with strong convulsive fondness, Whose country's wrongs, whose private injuries, For vengeance call? LASCALA. There spoke Capana's son. Yes, we will follow thee where vengeance leads, And free my Azlan. HOUACO. Stay, Lascalaâstay! Vengeance is slow. I, to Capana, must Unfold the deep and secret means, nor strike Till sure the blow. Thy Azlan's self would bleed Were this hand rash. (To Thelasco). Valiant Thelasco, Lend me that weapon in thy girdle fix'd. [Thelasco hesitates. Yes, Amazilia had been faithful too, But for the potent spells these treach'rous men Have foully wrested from mysterious nature. Give me that weapon, and await me here; Anon I will return with new life fraught, And freer thoughts. I cannot yield my soul, E'en to my country's claims, my father's love, Till I have satisfied a private duty Of strong imperious urgency. The weapon! Give it, Thelasco, to my eager grasp. THELASCO. Take it, and may'st thou plunge it to the hilt Where I would see it buried! [Houaco rushes out with the daggerâThelasco watches him. With eagle speed, By godlike vengeance wing'd, see how he darts From cliff to cliff. We at a distance, friends, Will follow on his steps, to grace his deeds, Or, if aught ill befall, to give him aid. [Exeunt, with music, as they entered. SCENE III. Alphonso lying on the bank where he had thrown himself in despairâLaila behind him scattering weeds around his head, unobserved by him. He sinks to sleep, and she comes gently forward. LAILA. At length a dull, and drowsy torpor steals O'er his torn bosom: such the lulling virtue Of this pale weed, whose chilly blossom shrinks From the fierce glare of day, expanding wide To the moist moon, that nightly brims its cup With vapours dank, of power to lock each sense, And lap the limbs in motionless repose.â Softâsoft!âmethought he moved. [She scatters more weeds. Deep sleep be on thee! Thou creature of another world, beyond The vast, and terrible ocean!âThou, so noble! And yet, so fatal!âSlumbers deep be on thee! While I (so prosper Heaven my true affection!) Seek the deluded, desperate Amazilia, Win back her faith to him, her destined husband, And to our peaceful valley lure her steps. [Exit. Enter Houaco, not seeing Alphonso. HOUACO. Yes, yes,âI will avenge my country's wrongs! Appease the Gods of India! claim my wife! And, more than all, pierce fell Pedrarias' breast! Wring from him, pang by pang, and groan by groan, Th'atonement of each several broken heart, That drags out life upon this ruin'd land! The thought awakes a dark, and sullen joy, Worthy of him who was Capana's sonâ Blasted by slavery, and to glory lost. [Turning to go, sees Alphonso. Thanks, ye immortal powers! who thus present The sacrifice to th'injured Godhead due! [He contemplates him. How still his slumbers! And can treachery sleep? How calm and open is his brow! Has guile So fair a habitation? It hasâit hasâ And shall not lurk beneath a form so gracious, To lure th'unwary to destruction. Thusâ [Going to strike. Why shakes my coward hand? It is a deed Of highest virtue!âpleasing to our Gods!â I will not shrinkâ [Advancing resolutely, and removing the garment from Alphonso's breast, starts back. The pledge of amity My father gave him, shields the very spot Where I would strike! [Returning with assumed resolution. I must remove it.âNoâ I dare not!ânoâ [Trembles, and drops the dagger. Capana guards thy life! ALPHONSO (starting up). Is it a joyous vision? or, indeed, Do I again behold my lost Houaco? HOUACO. Alphonso, thou behold'st thy murderer! But that this hand has fail'd.âThat sacred pledge Stood between thee and death! ALPHONSO (affectionately). Thou rav'st, Houaco. Come to my bosom!âArt thou not my friend? HOUACO. Stand off, false Spaniard!âBind these limbs with chains! Give to the rack (if thou would'st live secure) Th'assassin of the tyrant's guiltier son! But I will brave thy rage, and scorn thee still! ALPHONSO (seeing the dagger on the ground). Too true;âthis fatal weapon proves thy words. This have I not deserved of thee, Houaco! And thou shalt feel it, if thou hast a heart! Did I not swear to thee a brother's love? [Extending his arms affectionately towards him. The brother's part is ever to forgive. Oh then forget with me that thou hast wrong'd me. [Taking his hand. HOUACO (confounded, turning away). What powerful magic in his words o'ercomes me? Can he, unmoved, thus grasp his murderer's hand, Nor aught of anger, aught of fear betray? What hinders that I seize again yon weapon, And plunge it in his bold, unguarded bosom? What hinders?âbut that it were easier far To bury it, and my confusionâhere! [Striking his breast. ALPHONSO. Combat no longer with thy better feelings! Let thy heart speak, and, ere I clear myself, 'Twill bid thee rest thy head upon this bosom! [Houaco, overcome, throws himself on Alphonso's bosom. I am content.âThy honour trusts in mine! Be cheer'd;âbrush off that tear, and meet with smiles Thy Amazilia.âHer unalter'd faith Shall prove my truth.âHouaco, I can suffer, E'en as thyself, unmoved! HOUACO. Canst thou, Alphonso, Canst thou forgive the headlong rage that arm'd This hand against thy life? ALPHONSO. 'Tis not remember'd. Blot from thy mind alikeâBut seeâshe comesâ Be blest in her thou lov'stâ'tis all I ask. Let me conceal this weapon from her eyes. [Conceals the dagger in his bosom. Now all is well.âResume thy tranquil mind. Enter Amazilia in great agitation, breaking from Laila. AMAZILIA. Refuse me not to speak one last farewell!â Houaco here!âin friendly conference! Then am I lost indeed!âTheir bond of union Too well, too well I knowâmy wretchedness!â Instruct me, Laila, to pronounce my doom! And oh! Alphonso's God! support my courage! [She advances with great effort, and throws herself at Houaco's feet. Low at thy feet, behold thy wife, Houaco! Thou, pardon the involuntary error Of one, restored to dutyâand to thee! HOUACO (raising her, and pressing her to his bosom). Oh! spare me, Amazilia! lest my brain Support not all the joy that breaks upon me! (To Alphonso). Thou, before whom I bend with soul subdued, Disdain not the full triumph of thy goodness. The virtues I have prized are savage Nature'sâ Thine are from Heaven! ALPHONSO. Oh! no moreâno moreâ 'Tis time that good Capana share our joy. Thelasco and Indians approach in joyous procession. They stop suddenly with astonishment and terror on seeing Alphonso. Thelasco fixes his eyes on him with a menacing expression. The Indians seize their bows, and wait the signal to shoot. HOUACO (placing himself between Alphonso and the Indians.) My friends! my countrymen! replace your arrows. This is the godlike youth Capana spared! The Indian's friend!âBehold my father's pledge! [Pointing to the pledge. They drop their bows, and replace their arrows. To him I owe my liberty!âto himâ That I again thus clasp, my bosom's treasure! (To Thelasco). I was deceived, Thelasco,âthou shalt learn How much I, to the generous Spaniard, owe! THELASCO (aside, after an expression of cold assent). What magic drugs, what herbs of potent juice Yield the strong spells that guard this wily Spaniard? At his approach the God of Vengeance flies! Th'uplifted weapon slackens in the grasp, And every heart, with strange unwonted softness, Gives its full confidence! HOUACO. Lead on, my friends. Within your deep retreat a little space We will repose:âthis tender frame, o'ertoil'd, Requires short respite.âAmazilia, say, Shall it be so? AMAZILIA. Thy will, henceforth, is mine. [Houaco, Thelasco, and Indians, move off in triumph, among the rocks at the back of the stage, Amazilia looking mournfully at Alphonso as Houaco leads her away. Alphonso lingers behind, in great agitation. ALPHONSO. Repose!âdelay!âAnd must I, drop by drop, Dwell on the deadly draught myself prepared? Oh, that Time wore the driving Tempest's wing, Whose headlong sweep might leave no pause for thought, Till to Capana I restore his son, And in his happiness find peaceâor die! [Exit, following. The Scene closes on them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Scene among the Rocks, with a distant View of the Valley. Alphonso and Houaco. ALPHONSO. Yes, all is well. Now seek we Amazilia, Where late we left her with the mountain band? HOUACO. No, she is more secure in that retreat With those who followed on my youthful steps. The mountain lama could not footing hold On yon steep crags: the spoiler cannot find The well conceal'd and only access thither. My treasure's safe. We are not yet assured Whence was the clamour, as of hostile tongues, That broke, by fits, the stillness of the night. ALPHONSO. We have discovered nought that may confirm Thy fears, Houaco. Trust me, all is well. The sounds thou heard'st were, sure, imprison'd winds: They, in deep caverns pent, will chafe in tone, That, by each rock repeated, much resemble The brawling of rude tongues. Away with doubt! And from this cliff, as from the eagle's nest, Behold the wished for valley spread below. Within an hour thou wilt embrace thy father.â Give all thy soul to gladness! HOUACO. Oh! Alphonso, In this long-saddened heart joy cannot harbour But as the flash that o'er the stormy sky Darts amid rolling thunders, and again 'Tis darkness all! Alas! with sad forebodings Shuddering, I seek the vale. [He looks anxiously about. Distant cries are heard. And hark! Those sounds Are not the busy stir of peaceful life: Noânor the voice of gratulation. Hah! The din of war rings thus upon the ear, Or shouts of fierce pursuit. ALPHONSO. Forbid it, heaven! And yet thy terror has infected me. (Listening) Now all is still again. It were impossible! Thou know'st the dreadful thoughtâI dare not speak it. But sayâoh sayâit is impossible! HOUACO. And hark, again! Heard'st thou that hideous yell? It grows upon the ear. It must be so! ALPHONSO. If it be so, I by thy side will fall, And dearly sell each drop of my heart's blood For India's injured sons. Noâsave his father's,â No Spaniard's breast is sacred to Alphonso. [Drawing his sword. HOUACO. Yes, that same dagger shall redeem its guilt. Oh, give it me, and thou shalt see how strong Against an iron host, a single arm, Nerved as Houaco's, by a cause so dearâ My father! and my people! and my wife! Giveâgive the dagger! ALPHONSO. Take it; but first swear Thou wilt not aim it at Pedrarias' breast. HOUACO. Nay, take it back again, if such the terms. ALPHONSO (baring his breast). Then once more point it here! I will remove Capana's cherished pledge, and give it way! Or plunge it here, or say my father's sacred. HOUACO. And wherefore, think'st thou, I have suffer'd life? For two long years have dragged th'invader's chains? Born to command, protect, and lead a people, Have bowed this body to the servile oar? Wherefore did I reject thy fellowship, Till driven from his presence, cursed by him, My heart forgot thou wert Pedrarias' son? Wherefore all this?âbut that I hoped to quaff The cup of sweet revenge! E'en now 'tis mine, The luscious draught! and shall my lips refuse it? ALPHONSO. [Nearer cries are heard. The foe is on us! I will trust in friendship! Take thou the dagger to defend thy father: This sword must guard the author of my days E'en against thee! for not to parricide, Although to treason doom'd by holiest ties, Each crimson drop that swells within these veins Must flow for good Capana and his people! Indians pass across the stage pursued by Spaniards Alphonso and Houaco rush upon the Spaniards, and presently drive them back. The Indians gather round Alphonso and Houaco, full of joy and wonder. ALPHONSO. Yes, Indians, yesâye see Capana's son! Restored by Heaven to save you from your foe! Behold in me the Spaniard your cacique Released from death! both to your service vowed: By nature he!âand I by gratitude! On! follow us to liberty and vengeance! But mark me, friends; dismiss the well-aim'd shaft, Then instant turn, nor grapple with th'invader. Keep still aloofâsurround himâharass him; Be swiftâbe indefatigable.âOn!â [Exeunt with expressions of ardour and joy. SCENE II. The Valley, with the Altar, Throne, &amp;c. Pedrarias and Spaniards pursued by Houaco and Indians. Pedrarias recognises Houaco, and turns. PEDRARIAS. Is it the slave Zamori's daring hand Against Pedrarias raised? Stand! Indian, stand! [They for a moment contemplate each other. This blade shall give thee back thy forfeit life, So thou declare where thou hast left Alphonso! HOUACO. Tyrant, come on! nor parley with thy foe! See, in Zamori, great Capana's son! The chains that have disgraced these free-born limbs, My father's wrongs, my country's desolation, Render this little weapon swift, and sure, And terrible as the avenger's thunder! Thousands of slaughter'd Indians hovering breathe Their spirits in my soul, and guide my hand! [They close and struggle. Houaco disarms Pedrarias, and drops the dagger in the conflict; casts Pedrarias on the ground, and setting his foot on his breast, points his own sword at it. Lie there, thou fell destroyer of my people! Where are thy conquests now? thy power, thy greatness? I met thee man to man, and there thou liest! Beneath my foot I might crush out thy spirit, And rid my groaning country of its tyrant! One motion of this hand and thou art nothingâ A name!âa sound!âto future ages hateful, E'en of its terrors stript! But to Alphonso! The son thy rage has cursedâI give thy life! [He rushes out with Pedrarias's sword, leaving his dagger on the ground. PEDRARIAS. Am I a Spaniard?âhe a savage Indian? Oh for swift lightnings, earthquakes, hurricanes, To raze this new found world from out existence, And thus from record blot the conqueror's shame! Thousands on thousands withering curses blast thee, Insolent slave! Curst be this arm! and curst My dotard weakness! for not Pedrariasânoâ The father 'twas, whose edgeless sword dropt, palsied By the base slave's evasion, when I asked Of my lost son. But hold! Alphonso lives! Let me but find him, from the Indians tear him, Then ruinâslaughterâutter devastation Rage on, and feed insatiable revenge! But who are these? shall they behold me thus? Ha! the slave's dagger!âit may do me service. [Takes up the dagger, and conceals it in his breast. Enter Gusman and Spaniards with Capana and Indians captives. GUSMAN. My lord, behold the proud cacique, Capana! Thus victory is ours, although Alphonso, (Whom, were he not thy son, I might term traitor), Has raised his sword against his countrymen, Mowing them down with wild resistless rage, To rescue from our hands this savage chief. PEDRARIAS (with great anxiety). And did my people turn their arms against him? Who followed him?âWhere is he?âsay, how was it? GUSMAN. The frantic natives thronging on his steps, With hurtling arrows darken all the air, That even our veterans, appalled, shrink back, Or fall, ere they have marked the coming death! In firm array, if we advance, behold, As formless spirits of the night, they vanish! And on the right, or left, or in the rear, Gathering again, they deal their dole of death, And quick disperse as soon. Doubtful, astonished, Where'er thy son appeared our soldiers fled! Nor had I held my prisoner from the rescue, But that I pointed at his breast my sword! PEDRARIAS. Haste, Gusman, haste! Command that they respect The viceroy's son, nor harm him, on their lives! But, if it may be done, secure Alphonso, And bring him to my presence strongly guarded. [Exit Gusman. (To Capana). And do I then behold the proud cacique, Whose vain resistance has destroyed his people? CAPANA. Thou see'st a chief who for his people lived: A man who fought for native liberty. PEDRARIAS (with the utmost bitterness). Thou hoary savage! skilled in hellish arts! Thou who hast wrought upon a noble Spaniard To mock at filial piety, and fall From due allegiance to his sovereign lord! CAPANA. Tyrant, I gave thy son his forfeit life, Because I pitied thee!âand for this weakness Our Gods have justly now deserted me. But answer thou.âWas it thy treacherous son Who led thee hither? For the damned act But ill accords with these his deeds in arms. Say, must my latest breath, or curse, or bless him? PEDRARIAS. How may it aught import Pedrarias' son, The idle words a dying savage breathes? CAPANA. If right I judge, the youth whose life I spared, Capana's dying curse may much import him. PEDRARIAS. Nay, curse him not, old man! Thou hast no causeâ He bears a curse this heart would fain recall. CAPANA. Ha! is it so? Then will Capana bless him! PEDRARIAS. Dost thou insult a conqueror, whose nod May doom thee to such tortures as appal Humanity? CAPANA. No tortures can appal Capana's spirit! In this time-worn frame Kind Nature has, with gentle hand, unravelled Her own work, till there is little left for thee To mar with violence. Few strokes are needed To level with the dust the leafless trunk; While the majestic palm, in youth's full honours, Wearies the woodman. Alphonso rushes wildly in, followed by Houaco, and throws himself at Capana's feet. ALPHONSO. Oh my benefactor! Thus let me expiate, at thy feet, my folly! That I am guiltless, thy Houaco knows. [Presenting Houaco to him, who throws himself into his father's arms, and they remain engrossed with each other. PEDRARIAS. Confusion! Is it at Capana's feet Pedrarias' son should kneel, when in the presence Of an offended father? Turn, rash boy! âA father's anger may not last for ever,â If meek remorse, and duteous thoughts, succeed Thy fatal dereliction! ALPHONSO. Duteous thoughts This breast has ever own'd! Remorse, my father, Alphonso knows not! He has not betray'd His noble benefactor, and his friend; But, ruin'd with them, will partake their doom. PEDRARIAS. The flames are kindling will reduce thy friends To idle air, and dust that I may trample. ALPHONSO (to CAPANA). Disdain not thou my fellowship in death, My more than father! [Embracing his knees. PEDRADIAS (aside). Oh! impotence of rage! CAPANA (making a group with ALPHONSO, and HOUACO). Unhappy tyrant! object of my scorn! I mock the power thou boastest o'er my life! For what import a few convulsive throbs, That set at large a spirit fraught with joy, With love, with triumph, thou canst never know! See, I embrace my noble, long-lost son,â Nay, moreâthe captive youth my heart adopted, With filial tenderness, would die with me; While thou, who doom'st me to devouring flames, Enviest thy victim!âI could pity thee, But that to pity thee offends our Gods. [Embracing them both. My children dear alike! PEDRARIAS (frantic with rage). Has hell worse pains? By him adoptedâto his bosom prestâ A savage, by the right of war my slave!â I cannot wait the slow consuming flame, My swordâ [Grasping the empty scabbard. HOUACO (haughtily). Thy sword no longer, but thy conqueror's! Has wash'd away its guilt in Spanish blood. PEDRARIAS. Zamori too?âWorse hell! [Recollecting the dagger in his bosom. Hah! thoughtless slave, Thyself didst furnish to my rage the serpent Shall sting thee home!âDie, hoary villain,âdie! [Rushes to stab Capana, when Alphonso interposes his breast, receives the stroke, and falls on his father's neck. ALPHONSO (after a pause). My father! Oh my father,âyes, I thank thee. This stroke is merciful,âis kind.âIt gives The only good that now thy son could knowâ To die for him, my benefactor!âOh! If ever I was dear to thee, my father, Let not thy son lay down his life in vain. This blood, that flows thus freelyâgladly flowsâ At the strong call of gratitudeâis thine! Seeâon thy breast it falls!âOh! let it not There stagnate!ârather swell, as kindly dews, The latent germ of mercy! PEDRARIAS. My Alphonso! Curse on my frantic rage!âIt cannot be The blow was mortal? (With tenderness). Look up, and smile, my son! [Watches Alphonso with trembling anxiety and hope. CAPANA. Noble, but rash and ill-advised Alphonso! Why didst thou snatch me from the death I courted? I should have fallen in all my full-blown joys; Now, if I live, it is to sorrow. [Hiding his face, overcome. PEDRARIAS (with a forced smile and faltering voice). Nay, Thou would'st but terrify thy wretched father, Who in all nature loves but thee alone. Thou know'st it, and would'st work upon my fondness. But live, my boy! and it shall be henceforth E'en as thou wilt.âYes, I will heap each blessing On these, thy friends. [Alphonso makes an effort to express his joy, and falls back into his father's arms. PEDRARIAS (with extreme terror). He bleeds apace!âHelp! help! ALPHONSO. Oh!ânoâI feel I cannot live, my father! 'Twas Heaven unnerved, erewhile, thy arm, and now Directed with unerring might the strokeâ Heaven's pity spares meâwithout her to live!â Heaven's justice guides thy handâto execute The curseâthy lipsâbut bless me now, my father! Oh! bless thy dying child! PEDRARIAS. Distraction! Horror! Wretched old man! Despair is mine, and madness! (To Houaco). In pity, slave, take thou this hated life. ALPHONSO. Be calm, my father, nor thus doubly point The sting of death!âOh say,âmy friends are free! PEDRARIAS. They, and their people shall be free and happy. I swear it by the trembling hope I feel Thy parting soul forgives thy murderer. ALPHONSO. Now on thy dear, and honour'd breast, I sinkâ In sleep as calm as weighs down infant lids. [Looking affectionately at his father. 'Tis sweet to rest upon a parent's bosom! [Reaching his hand to Houaco. Give me thy hand, Houaco! Amaziliaâ Will grieve for me.âOh soothe her sorrow gently!â I thought thee dead, when first I saw the maid. HOUACO. And loved her, and did yield her to thy friend! And must I lose thee? Oh, thou gracious pattern Of virtues thou hast taught me first to know! [A moment of speechless grief, when Amazilia breaks her way through the attendants, who try to stop her. AMAZILIA. Nay!âGive me way! Not thousand, thousand weapons, All pointed at this breast, could stay my steps! [Stands gazing at the group, transfixed with horror. Then in the wildest manner. Ha! What have I to doâif it be so? PEDRARIAS. Away with her!âHer sacrilegious cries Disturb the awful horrors of despair Within a father's and a murderer's breast! HOUACO (going to her from ALPHONSO). My Amazilia! thus high Heaven reclaims Its own! and as a god, henceforth Alphonso Will watch o'er those he loved, and guide them still. AMAZILIA. Away!âI know thee notânor heed thy words! See thereâsee there!âHis spirit takes its flight! I must away! ALPHONSO. My Amazilia!âOh!â [Dies. AMAZILIA. He calls on me!âHe bids me followâSee! With lifeless hand he beckons me away! I come! I come! [Seizes the dagger which lay on the ground, and stabs herself. HOUACO. Oh, stay thy frantic hand! AMAZILIA (supported by HOUACO). Alphonso! Oh, one moment hovering stay! Thou didst refuse my fellowship on earth, But wilt thou now reject the attendant spirit, That through immeasurable space, with thee, Would soar to worldsâof Loveâand Liberty? [Breaks from Houaco, and throws herself on Alphonso's body. PEDRARIAS. Have ye not hatchets? arrows dipp'd in poison? Ye injured natives! though to vengeance vow'd, Oneâone devote to pity!â AMAZILIA (raising herself from the body, and looking wildly around her). Who are these? Oh! help,âand loose the bonds that bind me down To earth!âHow heavilyâOh! how heavily They weigh upon my bosom!âI would spurn The abject soil, and spring into the skies! ButâOh! I sinkâI sinkâWilt thou not stay? Where art thou now? [Struggling violently. Oh where? I see thee not! [She stares wildly on Pedrarias. It is thy murderer!âIt is thy father!â His eyes glare on me!âSave me from himâOh! [Gives a shriek, and dies. The curtain drops.</field>
