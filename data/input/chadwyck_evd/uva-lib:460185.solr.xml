      <field name="fulltext">DEMOPHOON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Demophoon, King of Thrace. Dirce, privately married to Timanthes. Creusa, Princess of Phrygia. Timanthes, privately married to Dirce. Cherinthus, in love with Creusa. Mathusius, a nobleman of the court. Adrastus, Captain of the royal guards. Olinthus, a child, the son of Timanthes and Dirce.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scene lies in Thrace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Gardens adjoining to several apartments of Demophoon's palace. Dirce, Mathusius. Dir. Believe me, sir, a parent's fond affection But hurries on that evil which you dread: Why should you hope to see your daughter's name Alone exempted from the fatal urn? You plead the king perhapsâ Mat. And just the plea: Am I, because a subject, less a father? Apollo wills some virgin nobly born Should stain his altar every year with blood On this returning day; but yet excludes not The maids of royal birth. Let him who shews Such rigid zeal to enforce the laws divine, Teach others patience by his own example: Let him recall those daughters kept at distance With artful policy: let him expose Their names in yonder urn; and let him feel What pangs distract a wretched parent's breast, When his heart trembles as the priest draws near The dreadful vase, while with a solemn mien His lips prepare to speak the victim's name. So may he blush with conscious shame to think He could till now with cruel pride look on, The tame spectator of another's woe. Dir. Thou know'st the laws are subject to the king. Mat. The laws of man, but not the laws of Heaven. Dir. Yet these a king explains. Mat. Not when the Gods So fully speak their will. Dir. Yet ne'er so fullyâ Mat. Dirce, no moreâI am resolv'd. Dir. O sir! Reflect awhile; quick runs the flame of wrath In mighty men, but slowly is extinguish'd: 'Twere rashness to provoke impending rage That's arm'd with power. Alas! the king already Beholds you with an unpropitious eye. I dread to think, if, now too far provok'd, He find new matter to augment his hatred, What mischief may ensue! Mat. In vain thou tell'st me Of wrath or hatred in his breast: while reason Asserts my cause, and Heaven inspires my thoughts. No longer shall this bosom groan, Oppress'd beneath its load of woe: Or the proud monarch on his throne, With me shall equal anguish know. We both are fathers, both confess The fears a father's fondness brings: Paternal love inspires no less The hearts of subjects than of kings. [Exit. SCENE II. Enter Timanthes. Dir. O were my lord less distant!âHeavens! he comes. Timan. My dearest wife! Dir. Ah! hold, some ear perhaps May catch the unwary sound. Remember, prince, A subject whose presumptuous love has dar'd To match with royal blood, must yield her life A forfeit for the offence. Timan. Fear not, my love! None hears, nor shallâTimanthes is thy guard. Dir. What friendly power restores thee to my arms! Timan. My father's mandate brings me from the camp; The cause to me unknown. But tell me, Dirce, Dost thou still love me? Art thou still the same, As when I left thee at the call of honour; And are thy thoughts still constant to Timanthes? Dir. And canst thou ask me? Canst thou doubt my faith? Timan. O Heaven! I doubt thee not; I know thy truth: But yet forgive me, if my too fond heart Delights to hear the pleasing sound repeated From those dear lips. How fares my boy Olinthus, The precious pledge of our connubial joys? Say, does his beauty with his years increase? Do his young features speak a father's likeness, Or bloom they with a mother's softer charms? Dir. Already have his tender feet begun To form uncertain steps: his looks already Assume the manly sternness, mix'd with grace, That charm'd me in his sire: but when he smiles He's all thyself; then fondly gazing on him Methinks I look on thee: how oft deceiv'd With the dear thought, I strain him to my bosom, And in the son embrace the absent father. Timan. Where is he now, my Dirce? Lead me to him; O let me see my boy! Dir. Forbear, my lord, Awhile suppress a parent's tenderness: He lives conceal'd; but 'midst the observing eyes That round us watch, to attempt access to him, At every hour, were dangerous. Oh! what anguish Attends the mystery of our loves conceal'd! Timan. I'm weary of dissembling thus; no more I'll bear these doubts and fears: this day shall yield Some blest expedient to relieve our pains. Dir. Alas! still greater dangers now impend: This is the day of annual sacrifice; And Dirce's name must stand the fatal chance. Such is the king's command, my anxious father Has dar'd to oppose it, and from their contention My fears increase. Timan. And does Mathusius know Our hands are join'd in Hymen's sacred ties? Dir. Forbid it, Heaven! for Dirce then were lost. Timan. Yet hear me; let us now persuade the king To seek the Oracle again; by this At least we gain more time for further thought. Dir. Already this is done. Timan. And what success? Dir. Short was the answer, and in terms obscure. âBeneath the wrath of Heaven your land must groan, â'Till time disclose the secret cause to light; â'Till to himself reveal'd the offender's known, âWho guiltless now usurps a prince's right.â Timan. Darkness and clouds! Dir. And should my lot be drawn For this day's sacrifice, what hopes remain? I fear not death; no, for her country's sake, Most gladly Dirce would submit to fate: But PhÅbus' words demand a virgin's blood. Shall I, a wife and mother, dare approach His sacred altars, an unhallow'd victim? Thus if I speak or not, I still am guilty; My silence Heaven, my speech offends the king. Timan. In desperate dangers desperate means are needful: The king must know the story of our nuptials. Dir. But how to evade the sentence of the law Impending o'er my head? Timan. A monarch made, A monarch can revoke the stern decree. Demophoon, though severe, is yet a father, And I a son: full well, my love, we know By fond experience what those names import; Nor do I now obscurely come before him: I bring all Scythia vanquish'd, Phasis quell'd, To welcome my return: my father sure May yield me some reward for kingdoms conquer'd. If these suffice not, tears at least shall move him; I'll kneel a suppliant at his awful throne, Embrace his knees, and melt him to compassion. Dir. Alas!âI doubt. Timan. My Dirce, doubt no more; Commit thy future destiny to me: Go then, but let this fix'd assurance still Dwell in thy mind, and calm thy troubled thoughts; Timanthes will be ever watchful o'er thee, And hold thy peace far dearer than his own. Dir. In thee I hope, my dearest love! To thee my fate resign: Whate'er for thee I'm doom'd to prove, With pleasure shall be mine. When death creeps chilly to my breast, Could I but this obtain, To boast I die of thee possest, I should not die in vain. [Exit. SCENE III. Timanthes alone. O Fortune! wherefore did thy lavish hand Bestow on Dirce every female charm; Beauty unmatch'd, and virtue scarcely human, Yet blindly place her in a subject's rank? But be it soâit rests on me to amend The partial error: Thrace, some future day, With joy shall view her partner of my throne. But see, my father comes; no longer let me Conceal the secret from him. SCENE IV. Enter Demophoon attended. Demo. Prince!âmy son! Timan. My lord! my father! [kneels and kisses his hand. Demo. Rise. Timan. Behold me here, Obedient to your royal will. Demo. I know Thy warlike genius brooks not peaceful courts; And thou, perchance, reluctant hast receiv'd My orders that recall'd thee from the field. Thy triumphs, prince, are mine: my soul exults In every deed, and conquers by thy sword: I know the worth of all thy arms have won, But thou art dearer to my heart than all. Thy toils demand refreshment: valour gains New vigour from repose; for ever bent, The bow at length will lose the elastic force. 'Tis thine to merit, to reward is mine: If then the prince and son have done their part, The king and father must accomplish their's. Timan. 'Tis now the wish'd-for timeâbe bold and speak! [aside. So well I know the goodness of my father, I dare presumeâ Demo. O no! thou canst not tell, How dear I hold thee: little thinks my son How much his peace employs my careful hours. I read thy thoughts this instant: even thy silence I construe for thee: all thy soul desires, Is to behold thy consort by thy side, And see all Thrace spectators of thy love. Is it not so? Timan. What means he! sure my father Has heard the secret story of our nuptials. [aside. Demo. Thou dar'st not speak, and this respectful silence Persuades me to fulfill thy utmost wishes. I own at first I doubted on the choice, Nay felt reluctance to consent to ties My nature seem'd to abhor; the father's enmity Rose in my mind, and made me hate the daughter. At length my sole desire to see thee happy Prevail'd o'er all. Timan. I can no longer doubt. [aside. Demo. What passions, my Timanthes, can control A father's fondness pleading for his son? Timan. O royal sir! you give me life unhop'd; This goodness melts meâlet me seek my bride And bring her to your presence. Demo. StayâCherinthus, Thy younger brother, shall conduct her to me. Timan. Heavens! what unlook'd-for happiness is this! [aside. Demo. A messenger, dispatch'd by my command, Waits her arrival at the portâ Timan. The port! Demo. Who when th'expected ship appears in sight, Will give us tidings strait. Timan. What ship, my lord? Demo. The ship that from the shores of Phrygia brings The fair Creusa to thy nuptial bed. Timan. O Gods! [aside. Demo. I know thou think'st it strange, Timanthes: The hate, devolving from the sire to son, Between our race, might seem to exclude the hope Of such alliance: but the princess brings A kingdom's dowery with her love, herself The only offspring of an aged king. Timan. My lordâI hop'dâO fatal, fatal error! [aside. Demo. There is no other partner for thy bed, Unless a subject bornâ Timan. And what imports it, A subject or a princess? Demo. No, my son, The shades of our great ancestors would blush To see their race demean'd; from them we hold The statute, that condemns to death the maid, Who, born a subject, dares to join in marriage With one of royal blood; and while I reign, I'm guardian of the law, and will inforce it Even with severest rigour. Timan. Sacred sirâ SCENE V. Enter Adrastus. Adras. The Phrygian ships, my lord, have gain'd the port. Demo. Then go, Timanthes, haste to meet thy bride. Timan. Who, I, my lord? Demo. Yes, thou, my son; myself Would with thee thither, but the mournful rites Of sacrifice demand me at the temple. Timan. Yet stay and hear me, sirâ Demo. What would'st thou? Speak. Timan. Hear me confessâbut whither am I driven? Yet let me ask youâO my tortur'd soul! O sir! the sacrifice!âthe lawâmy wife! O direful law! O most unhappy bride! O cruel sacrifice and fatal chance. Demo. No moreâI cannot now prolong the time. The terms are settled, prince, my promise given: A monarch's word is sacred, he who rules Must guard his faith unstain'd; and oft we find Virtue the offspring of necessity. By this, in arms the warrior sleeps, The sailor sings amid the deeps; And death we view without affright. The timorous beasts that fly the foe, Can strength assume, and boldness show, When by necessity they fight. [Exit. SCENE VI. Timanthes alone. What guilt has Dirce known, malignant stars! That thus you join to heap afflictions on her? You, who were present at the blameless union, Ye powers! protect the love yourselves inspir'd. This stroke has chill'd my heart, and all in vain I strive to call my wandering spirits home. I fondly hop'd to reach the shore, And hear the winds no longer roar; But find my hapless bark again Expos'd amid the stormy main. And while from one my vessel flies, Another rock my fate supplies: In vain, alas! the first is past, When greater perils wait the last! [Exit. SCENE VII. A sea port finely decorated for the arrival of the princess of Phrygia. A view of several ships, from the most magnificent of which Creusa and Cherinthus, accompanied by a numerous train, disembark to the sound of various barbarous instruments. Creusa, Cherinthus. Creu. What means this sadness, prince, that hangs upon you? Why are you pensive thus? with silent gaze You look and sigh; and if with friendly speech I urge your converse, when you seem prepar'd To tell me much, your faltering tongue is mute. Where is your wonted cheerfulness, the grace That season'd your discourse? Are you in Thrace The same Cherinthus that I knew in Phrygia? Or is it thus, with melancholy looks, You Thracians to her lord conduct a bride? Is this the omen of my future nuptials? Cher. If my afflictions bear a sad presage, On me, fair princess, every evil fall: My stars can little add to griefs like mine; Nor breathes a wretch so hopeless as Cherinthus! Creu. Am I unworthy to be told your sorrows, That thus you slight my counsel and assistance? Cher. Must I then speak? I will, I will obey you: From the first momentâfrom that fatal dayâ Alas! I dare no moreâforgive my silence: My speech I fear would but incite your anger. Creu. Your diffidence already has deserv'd it; 'Tis true I am a woman, and your secret Were ill confided to a female breast: I urge no furtherâlead me to the palace. Cher. O Heavens! yet stay:âbe calm and I will speak: 'Tis thou alone hast robb'd me of my peace: I gaze with rapture on thy matchless charms; I know my love is vain, and know that death Alone can fix a period to my sufferings: Princess, behold the causeâ Creu. What means this boldness? Cher. I knew too well I should offendâ Creu. Cherinthus; From thee at least I hop'd for more respect. Cher. The faults of loveâ Creu. Forbear; I'll hear no more. [going. Cher. Since you've compell'd me to reveal my crime, Vouchsafe to hear th'excuse. Creu. What canst thou say? Cher. That though I love thee, I deserve thy pity: If there's a crime, Demophoon is the guilty. My father should have found some other hand To bring thee to Timanthes: shall he wonder, Who thoughtless ventures fuel near the fire, If flames are kindled? Thou hast charms, and I Have eyes to view: I saw, admir'd and lov'd: Each day beheld me near thee, while the name Of kinsman gave a license to my tongue. Nor did this name alone deceive the world, I was deceiv'd myself: that love which made Me sigh for ever for Creusa's presence, Appear'd but duty: and a thousand times I thought to paint the affections of a brother, While my too eager speech betray'd my own. Creu. Alas! too plain I saw it allâ[aside.] Such boldness, So unexpected, strikes me dumb with wonder. Cher. And yet sometimes I felt a flattering hope That secret sympathy inspir'd our souls. Methought I oft observ'd a tender sigh Steal from thy breast, view'd in thy eyes a softness That seem'd much more than friendshipâ Creu. Hold, Cherinthus: Thou dost begin to abuse my easy nature: But let me hear thee speak no more of love. Cher. What can this mean? Creu. Attend, and mark me well: If from this hour thou dost not learn a converse More suited to our state, no longer dare Appear before meânow, thou know'st my meaning. Cher. Ungrateful! yes, thy cruel will I see requires my life, This hand shall then thy wish fulfill And death conclude the strife. But when I'm dead, review, though late, The cause for which I fell; And own I found too hard a fate, For loving thee so well. [going. Creu. But whither go'st thou?âstay. Cher. Forbearâmy presence Too much offends you. Creu. Hear me. Cher. By my stay I should insult your patience. Creu. Say, Cherinthus, At whose command dost thou depart? Cher. Too well I understand thee, though thou speak'st it not. Creu. Ah! prince! how ill thou know'st me; from that hourâ O Heavens! Cher. Go onâ Creu. From that ill-fated hourâ What am I saying!âleave me if thou wilt. Cher. Inhuman princess! yes, I will depart; And yet perhapsâBut see, my brother comes! SCENE VIII. Enter Timanthes in haste. Timan. Cherinthus, say, is this the Phrygian princess? Cher. It is. Timan. I would converse in private with her; Vouchsafe a moment to retire apart. Cher. I shall obeyâO torture! [aside, retires. Creu. Sir! my lord! Timan. Imperial virgin! we are both in danger: And thou alone canst, if thou wilt, preserve Creusa's glory and Timanthes' life. Creu. What has befallen? Timan. Our parents have decreed An union to thyself perhaps ungrateful, By me unsought: thy regal virtues, princess, Deserve a God far rather than Timanthes. But Fate forbids me to become thy husband; There is a bar which nothing can surmount; My father knows it not, nor can I speak it: 'Tis yours to avert the shame of a refusal: Preventârefuse me firstâsay, I'm displeasingâ Enlarge my faults, say all thou wilt, despise me; And by this only means our fate has left us, At once preserve thy fame, my peace and life. Creu. Indeed!â Timan. I can no longer stay: my brother, Do thou conduct the princess to the palace. Creu. Tell me at leastâ Timan. Already have I told Whate'er my breast conceal'dâreflectâfarewell! [Exit. SCENE IX. Cherinthus, Creusa. Creu. Gods! to Creusa, to the royal heir Of Phrygia's sceptre this affront!âCherinthus, Hast thou a heart? Cher. I had; but thou, fair princess, Hast now depriv'd me of it. Creu. If thou lov'st me, Avenge my injur'd honour: all I have, My heart, my hand, my bed, my throne are thine: I shall not set a bound to my reward. Cher. What canst thou ask? Creu. The blood of bold Timanthes. Cher. My brother!â Creu. Art thou pale? Go, coward wretch! I'll find some other will deserve my love. Cher. Yet hear me, princess! Creu. Peace; I'll hear no more: I see your mutual purpose to betray me. Cher. Canst thou so far distrust my faithful passion? Creu. I scorn thy passion whether false or true. The affection of a timorous lover Ever shall my soul despise, In whose breast we ne'er discover Generous sparks of valour rise; Who, to glorious deeds a stranger, Fears in fight his sword to prove; Only bold, when far from danger, He can safely talk of love. [Exit. SCENE X. Cherinthus alone. Ye powers! what means this storm! How could Timanthes Excite her anger thus?âTo bid me steep This hand in brother's blood! the thought alone Chills me with horror!âwith what fix'd resentment, And pride she spoke! yet even her rage can please; I find still something claim my admiration, And soften every passion into love. Beauty bears eternal arms In that dear, that lovely face: Anger gives it stronger charms; Pity gives it softer grace. When she smiles, from ocean's stream, Heavenly Venus seems to rise: When she frowns, I surely deem Pallas lighted from the skies. [Exit. SCENE XI. Mathusius in haste, with Dirce by the hand. Dir. Ah! whither, whither must I go, my lord? Mat. Far hence, remote to Lybia's inmost deserts, To wild Hircania's woods, or Scythia's rocks; Or to some land unknown, by distant seas Divided from the abodes of human kind. Dir. Ah me! Mat. Why, fathers, for your children's sake, Exert your anxious care? Behold the fruits; See what respect the laws of nature find. Dir. Alas! he surely knows the fatal secret; Our marriage is discover'd: heavenly powers! [aside. Pity me, sir! Mat. There is no pity left, Nor faith; all, all is lost! Dir. See at your feetâ Mat. What wouldst thou? Dir. Here I'll weep such floods of tearsâ Mat. Thy fortune calls for something more than tears. Dir. Then learnâ Mat. Await me here; I fly with speed To seek some vessel to transport us hence. [Exit. SCENE XII. Dirce alone. Ah! to what region must I now be led To end my wretched life! my child! my child! Poor innocent! and you, my much-lov'd lord, O Gods! what torture to forsake you thus Without one parting look! SCENE XIII. Enter Timanthes. Timan. My life! my Dirce! And have I found thee then? Dir. My dearest lord! Farewell, farewell for ever! to thy care I here commend my child; for me embrace him, Give him this kiss, and when his ripening age Can feel compassion, tell him all my sufferings. Timan. What says my love? Thou mak'st my blood run coldâ Dir. Alas! our union is no more a secret; My father knows it all, and wild with rage Will bear me distant hence; I know him well, There is no hope remains. Timan. Be comforted, Compose thy troubled breast, my love, my wife, Thou hast thy husband with thee. SCENE XIV. Enter Mathusius in haste. Mat. Dirce, fly, Let us be gone. Timan. Dirce must not depart. Mat. And who forbids it? Timan. That shall I. Mat. Indeed! Dir. O Heaven! Mat. This sword shall guard a father's right. [draws. Timan. And this shall vindicate the rights I claim. [draws. Dir. Ah! prince! what would'st thou do?âO hold, my father! Mat. Impious! to oppose me when I seek to save A guiltless maid from cruel sacrifice. Dir. O Gods! Timan. But thusâ Dir. O peace: I was deceiv'd; All yet is secretâ [aside to Timanthes. Mat. Canst thou then desire To see her perish? Dir. My unguarded terror Had near betray'd me. [aside. Timan. Pardon, sir, this rashness; Appearance has misled me; I beheld Thy angry gestures, saw her streaming tears, I had no time for thought, but deem'd it piety To save her from thy rage. Mat. Obstruct not therefore Our purpos'd flight: if longer Dirce stays, She must be made the victim. Dir. Heavenly powers! Timan. Has then her name been drawn? Mat. No, but thy father Has most unjustly doom'd her guiltless life, Without the sentence of the fatal urn. Timan. Why should his anger kindle thus against thee? Mat. To punish me because I durst attempt To exclude my daughter from the lots of death: Because I durst produce his own example; Because the struggles of a father's fears Made me forget the subject. Dir. Mighty powers! All has conspir'd to hasten my destruction. Timan. Doubt not, Mathusius: nor believe the king Can prove so cruel; though his rage at first Bears all before it, cooler reason soon Succeeds and softens all. SCENE XV. Enter Adrastus with Guards. Adras. Guards! seize on Dirce. [guards surround her. Mat. Did I not tell thee, prince? Timan. What means this violence? Dir. O me unhappy! Timan. For what cause is Dirce Secur'd a prisoner? Adras. 'Tis the king's command; Conduct her hence. Dir. Ah! whither? Adras. Hapless maid, Soon shalt thou know. Dir. O prince!âmy father, helpâ Have pity on me. Timan. No; it ne'er shall beâ [draws. Mat. Shall I permitâ [draws. Adras. If either dare approach, Behold I plunge this poniard in her breast. Timan. Impious! Mat. Unfeeling wretch! Adras. The royal mandate Shall justify my deeds. Dir. Ah thenâ Adras. Dispatch; For, Dirce, all thy fond complaints are vain. Dir. I come. [going. Timan., Mat. Barbarian! [going to attack Adrastus. Adras. Hold. [about to strike. Timan., Mat. O stay, inhuman! Dir. Forgiveâmy fatherâO my heart! Remember, prince!âthus, thus to part! Since I must die, 'twere some relief, In words at least to vent my grief: Why should I now such woe sustain, Yet Fate forbid me to complain? O say, ye powers! what crime unknown, Has drawn on me your vengeance down? [Exit with Adrastus, guarded. SCENE XVI. Timanthes, Mathusius. Timan. O give me counsel, Gods! Mat. Earth opens not, Nor lightnings fly to punish such injustice; And shall we say Jove watches o'er mankind? Timan. Let us not waste, my friend, these precious moments; Go and observe where Dirce is conducted, Myself, meantime, will haste to appease my father. Mat. I have no comfort left. Timan. O Heavens! delay not, For should the king's resentment still continue, Some other means shall save her. Mat. Generous prince! Thy virtues might deserve a better father. [embraces him.âExit. Timan. Unless the Gods assistance lend, And hope and fortitude bestow, I feel my constancy will bend Unequal to its weight of woe! To see my lov'd, my trembling bride, Thus torn reluctant from my side, To cruel death decreed! To hear her mourn, yet mourn in vain: Ye powers! what anguish I sustain! How does my bosom bleed! [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A private apartment. Demophoon, Creusa. Demo. Ask what thou wilt, and ask without constraint, I can this day refuse Creusa nothing. Yet speak not in behalf of Dirce; no, Her father shall behold her die: the wretch Has dar'd to insult the majesty of kings: Even in my presence, 'midst the vulgar herd, He sow'd seditious rumours, nay oppos'd Our high decree, and durst compare himself To me his sovereignâI'll no longer reign, If insolence like this must pass unpunish'd. Creu. I come not, sir, to plead another's cause; I know full well your purpose: my demands Are for myself alone. Demo. What would'st thou seek? Creu. Let me return to Phrygia: your permission Is wanting that the ships may quit the port. Grant my request: you cannot, sure, refuse me; Unless Creusa comes, as much she fears, To be a slave, and not partake a throne. Demo. What say'st thou, princess? what suspicions fill Thy breast? what passion dictates to thy tongue? Wilt thou depart, and leave the prince, forego The promis'd nuptials? Creu. For Timanthes, sir, Creusa boasts no charms; a mortal beauty Must never hope to win himâfor himselfâ But this imports not meâI would be goneâ Have I your leave, my lord? Demo. Thou art thyself The mistress of thy actions: think not, princess, Unwilling I'd detain thee: yet, permit me, To say I hop'd far other from Creusa. Creu. I know not which most justly may complain: The prince indeedâno moreâto sum up allâ Let me departâ Demo. But hast thou seen my son? Creu. I have. Demo. And did he speak to thee? Creu. He did: Would he had never spoken! Demo. Ha! what said he? Creu. Excuse me, sir, let this sufficeâ Demo. Creusa, I understand thee; thou hast found the prince Rough in address, unskill'd in courtly phrase. Perchance he gave thee but a cold reception, I can forgive thy anger. Born in Phrygia, Nurtur'd in all the softness of thy country, A Thracian's manners must be harsh to thee: Wonder not then if such Timanthes seem: Bred up in arms, the soul's more tender passions To him are yet unknown: be thine the glory To instruct him in the mysteries of love. Thine be the easy task; for, O Creusa! What power resides not in a face so charming, And eyes that sparkle with such heavenly fire? What breast, inspir'd by thee, but soon must learn? Creu. Reflect it ill befits with my condition, To stand expos'd to a refusal. Demo. How! Refusal? wherefore should'st thou fear it, princess? Creu. Who knows th'event? Demo. This day my son shall give To thee his hand, if thou wilt deign to accept it. I plight the faith and honour of a king; And should he dare to disobey my willâ A father's just resentmentâbut no moreâ It cannot beâI am alarm'd too soon. Creu. Yes, let him force Timanthes to consent, That so I may refuse him. [aside.]âWell, my lord, I take your wordâbe thine the careâbut ifâ Demo. Enough; to me securely trust thy honour. Creu. You know what suits Creusa's name, And what beseems my high degree: Reflect, nor let a thought of blame, Whate'er the event, be cast on me. As king and father here you stand, Remember what those words comprise; It fits the father to command, It fits the monarch to chastise. [Exit. SCENE II. Demophoon alone. What arrogance is thisâas ifâbut yet Her rank, her sex, her youth may plead her pardon; And sure Timanthes has but ill receiv'd her. I must rebuke him, teach him better thoughts, To change his coldness and assume the lover. Goâcall Timanthes to meâbut he comes. SCENE III. Enter Timanthes. Timan. My king! my father! pity, grace and pardon! Demo. For whom dost thou entreat? Timan. The unhappy daughter Of poor Mathusius. Demo. 'Tis already done; Her doom is fix'd; the sentence that has pass'd A monarch's lips, is not to be revok'd. Repentance springs from error; but a king Who errs not, never can repent. Timan. On earth The Gods are worshipp'd, as they bend their ear To mortal vows: but Fate, the greatest power, Against whose dread decree no prayers avail, Finds none to raise an altar or a temple To his divinity. Demo. And know'st thou not That Fear's the strongest guardian of the throne? Timan. Ill to be trusted. Demo. Him respect succeeds, His rightful offspring. Timan. Doubtful as the parent. Demo. Soon will it grow to love. Timan. But love dissembled. Demo. Time will instruct thee what thou yet must learn; But let us change the subjectâTell me, son, What hast thou done to offend the Phrygian princess, Whose hand this day should join to thee in marriage? Timan. I feel such strong repugnance to the union, I fear my best resolves can ne'er surmount it. Demo. And yet thou mustâ Timan. Of this we'll speak hereafter. For Dirce now behold me at your feet; [kneels. O! grant, my lord, grant to your son's request Her guiltless life! Demo. Dost thou presume again To name her? If thou valuest aught my love, Forego this enterprise. Timan. My dearest father! I cannot now obey youâO! if ever I have deserv'd a parent's tenderness: If with a bosom mark'd with honest wounds, I have return'd a conqueror to your arms: If e'er my triumphs in the glorious field, The timely fruits of your august example, Have drawn the tear of pleasure from your eyes; Reverse the doom of Dirce: lost, unhappy, She has no friend but me to plead her cause; Cast off by all, her hope's in me alone! O Heaven! 'twere most inhuman to behold her, In early bloom of years, who never knew The name of guilt, stretch'd on the fatal altar In agonizing suffering, to behold The life-warm blood gush from her tender breast; To hear the last sad accents from her lips; To mark her dying eyesâbut, thou art pale! Why look'st thou thus upon me?âO my father! I know, I know the gracious signs of pity: Do not repent, my lord, indulge it still; For never will I quit these sacred feet, [kneels. 'Till thou hast given the word to pardon Dirce. Demo. Rise, prince!âAlmighty powers! What must I think That with such tenderness thou dwell'st upon her? What mean these starts of some mysterious passion! And can it be thou lov'st her? Timan. 'Tis in vain I seek to hide it longer. Demo. Now full well I see what caus'd thy coldness to Creusa: And what would'st thou intend? For canst thou hope I'll e'er consent to join thee to a subject? Reflect that secret nuptialsâO! if once I could suspect itâ Timan. What mistrust is this? I swear to all the Gods I'll ne'er espouse her: I do not ask it: give her but to live. But if your will is fix'd, and she must die, Believe me, sir, your son will perish too. Demo. To gain our purpose let us yield a littleâ [aside. Well then, since thou wilt have it so, thy favourite Shall live, my son, I give her to thy prayers. Timan. My dearest father! [attempts to kiss his hand. Demo. Holdâa parent's goodness Sure merits some return. Timan. My life itselfâ Demo. No, my dear son, I ask far less from thee: Learn to respect my choice in fair Creusa, And be no more averse to wed the princess. Timan. O Heaven! Demo. I see it pains thee; but the struggle Thy heart endures, adds merit to obedience. Have I not felt compassion for thy weakness? Do thou preserve my honour: think, Timanthes, How will the breath of fame traduce thy father, If through thy fault his sacred faith is forfeit. Thou canst not harbour such ingratitude; I know it wellâcome; let us to the temple, Thither conduct thy bride, and there before The attesting Gods, at once my son fulfil What justice now demands from thee and me. Timan. My lordâI cannotâ Demo. Prince! thou yet hast heard The father only; force me not to employ The king's authority. Timan. Sacred alike I hold the dictates of the king and father: But well thou know'st, love cannot be compell'd. Demo. Love rules the nuptials of the subject only, A greater power must join the hands of princes: Their choice is guided by the public good. Timan. If such a price must buy the good of othersâ Demo. No moreâI am weary, prince, of fruitless talk; This reason may sufficeâ'tis my command. Timan. And I can neverâ Demo. Ha! what means this boldness? Dost thou not knowâ Timan. I know thou wilt chastise me. Demo. Yes, thou shalt feel thy punishment begin In her thou lov'st, thy Dirce. Timan. O for pity! Demo. Away. Timan. Yet hearâ Demo. I have heard enough, and Dirce Shall die; her doom is seal'd. Timan. And if she diesâ Demo. Art thou not gone yet? Timan. Yes! I will departâ But if th'event should proveâ Demo. Presumptuous boy! Gods! dost thou threat? Timan. I know not when I speak In prayers or threats, reason by slow degrees Forsakes her seatâO force me not, my father, To passion's wild extremesâI here protestâ I'll doâwhat may I not!â Demo. Speak out, ingrate! What wilt thou do? Timan. All that despair can prompt. Would'st thou have me prudent still; Would'st thou my innocence defend? 'Tis thine to rule me at thy will; On thee my future deeds depend. My thoughts no longer peace can find, While she, whose danger fills my mind, With frenzy fires my soul: My passions lighten from my eyes; No force of reason can suffice My fury to control. [Exit. SCENE IV. Demophoon alone. Must all insult me thus? yon' haughty princess, My daring subject, and rebellious son? 'Tis time to vindicate my slighted power. Guards, see that Dirce be without delay Led to the sacrifice: from her proceed My son's presumption, and her father's guilt: But were she innocent, she must not live; The kingdom's weal requires Creusa's nuptials; And these Timanthes never will complete Till death remove his Dirce. When the state May be preserv'd, 'tis just to sacrifice One life, tho' guiltless, for the general good. Thus the swain, who lops away Some superfluous flower or bough, Hopes to see, a future day, The plant or tree more lovely grow. Sense and reason must beware One more favour'd part to cherish, When the whole, without our care, May for want of moisture perish. [Exit. SCENE V. Porticoes. Mathusius, Timanthes. Mat. Our only refuge thenâ Timan. Yes, dearest friend, Our only refuge is in flight: the king, So far from yielding to my earnest prayers, Grew more incens'd: fly then, and fly this instant. Provide a speedy bark, therein secure Whate'er thou hast of choice and valued treasure: And where amid the rocks the sea breaks in, Right of the port, conceal'd expect me: there I'll join thee soon with Dirce. Mat. But her guardsâ Timan. The care be mine to elude their vigilance; I know a secret path that to her prison Can lead my steps: O haste! for time neglected Will punish those who slight occasion offer'd. Mat. Some friendly power its aid extends, Some power that innocence befriends, Has on thy soul these thoughts imprest: Th'example of thy cruel sire Could soft compassion ne'er inspire, To influence thus thy generous breast. [Exit. SCENE VI. Timanthes alone. Vast is the sacrifice I make to love: To fly to poverty, to sink myself Even to the humble state of private life: To lose the crown and my paternal wealth: But dearer are my wife and son than all. Each other good has no intrinsic worth, Opinion makes it great. The tender feelings Of father, husband, have their sacred spring In nature's self: these are not bred by custom, Or early thoughts instill'd from infant years: The seeds are in ourselves, are with us born. Fly thenâdelay no moreâbut who comes here? Perchance the kingâbehold the guards approach! O no!âand yet I see the holy priests, And with them one in snowy vesture clad. But, ha! what do I see!âAlmighty powers! It is my wife! SCENE VII. Enter Dirce, in white vestments, crowned with flowers, Priests and Guards. Timan. O stay! my Dirce! speak, What can this mean? Dir. At length my hour is come; These eyes must never, never see thee more! O prince! how cruel is this separation! Timan. And does my fatherâ Dir. 'Tis his will that I This instant suffer. Timan. Never whilst I liveâ [going to draw. Dir. What would'st thou do, my lord! against such numbers Thou seek'st in vain to save me, but must rush Thyself on certain ruin. Timan. True, my love, I'll seek some better way. [going. Dir. But whither go'st thou? Timan. To draw together all the friends I have; Go thou in peace; I'll reach the fane before thee. Dir. Yet thinkâO Heaven!â Timan. There is no room for thought: My pity's turn'd to fury: tremble all That dare oppose me: should my father's selfâ My frenzy knows no boundsâlet sword and flames Destroy the palace, temple, priests and Gods! [Exit. SCENE VIII. Dirce, Priests, Guards. Dir. O stay!âhe hears me notâEternal powers! Preserve his lifeâfor, ah! should he be lost, What friendly care shall guard our orphan son! The pangs of terror for a husband's danger Were only wanting to complete my woes: Did I but know of whom to implore relief! SCENE IX. Enter Creusa. Dir. Ah! princess! ah! Creusa! grant me pity. Thou canst not sure refuse a dying wretch, Who, 'midst the bitterest grief, essays to move Thy gentle heart, no stranger to compassion. Creu. Who art thou? Say, what would'st thou? Dir. Sure my fate Too well is known by thee: my name is Dirce; I go to die, yet guiltless of a crime: I ask no pity for myself, Creusa; But save, defend the poor distress'd Timanthes: To guard my life, he courts his own destruction. If e'er th'entreaties of the dying move, O! let him find in you a kind protectress! Appease his rage, or, O! procure his pardon For all the frantic deeds of rash despair. Creu. And can it be, that on the verge of death, Thou feel'st so deeply for another's welfare. Dir. Enquire no furtherâfate decrees him thine. Should I, alas! those ills impart I've long been doom'd to know, The tale would break thy tender heart With sympathy of woe. But thus with every pang opprest, All hopeless of relief; A rock, that pity ne'er confess'd, Might soften at my grief. [Exit with the priests and guards to the temple. SCENE X. Creusa alone. How strong a power has beauty! If the charms Of this afflicted thus can touch my heart, Well may Timanthes stand excus'd, who loves her. I scarce can hold from tears: this hapless pair With faithful passion love, and I'm the cause Of their misfortunesânoâforbid it, Heaven! Some means shall yet be foundâ SCENE XI. Enter Cherinthus. Creu. Thou com'st, Cherinthus, In happy time to assist me. Cher. Dost thou, princess, Still seek my brother's blood? Creu. No; rage inspir'd That thought, and with my rage the thought is lost: I seek his preservation. Dirce now Goes to be sacrific'd, Timanthes raves In wild despair: haste thou to calm his fury, While I, on his behalf, entreat the king. Cher. O goodness worthy of a princely mind! And who would not adore thee, fair Creusa? Ah! wert thou not so cruel to Cherinthus! Creu. How hast thou found Creusa cruel to thee? This heart is different far from what thou think'stâ Perhapsâbut goâthou would'st enquire too much. Cher. Kind stars! I ask not if ye prove Still malignant to my state; 'Tis enough that she I love, Gives me but to doubt my fate. The wretch who, long inur'd to grief, Had ne'er one happy hour to prize; Whene'er he doubts, receives relief, For hopes begin when doubts arise. [Exit. SCENE XII. Creusa alone. Could'st thou, my dear Cherinthus, know what pain This rigour, that offends thee, gives Creusa, I should not seem the tyrant thou hast thought me. 'Tis true I have not yet espous'd Timanthes: The change is easy; on myself alone Depends the choiceâbut let me thinkâI came To wed the kingdom's heir; and shall I yield To live a subject where I thought to reign? No, virtue, glory, pride forbid such weakness. Happy, happy age of gold! Lovely innocence of old, When our pleasures uncontroll'd, Ne'er their foes in virtue found. Now we groan beneath the weight Of slavish forms and galling state, While ourselves our pains create, And forge the chains with which we're bound. [Exit. SCENE XIII. The temple of Apollo. A magnificent flight of steps ascending to the temple, the inside of which is discovered to the spectators betwixt the pillars that support the building. The altars are seen thrown down, the fire extinguished, the sacred vessels overturned, the garlands, axes and other implements of sacrifice scattered upon the ground; the Priests flying, the royal Guards pursued by the friends of Timanthes, and tumult and confusion in every part. Timanthes appears driving some of the Guards down the steps, then is lost behind the scenes. Dirce from the top of the steps calls to him with the utmost terror. A slight skirmish ensues, in which the friends of Timanthes have the advantage. The combatants being gone off, Dirce, seeing Timanthes again, runs down from the temple to stop him. Dir. O! all ye sacred powers of Heaven! defend him! Hear me, Timanthes, O! in pity hear meâ Timan. Come, come, my love, thou art safe. Dir. Ah me! Timanthes, What hast thou done? Timan. I've done but as I ought. Dir. Unhappy me!âAlas! my lord, thou art wounded, O Gods! thou art all o'er blood. Timan. Be not dismay'd; The blood thou see'st ne'er issued from these veins, 'Tis what my rage from other breasts has drawn. Dir. Yet look! [looking out. Timan. No more, my life! compose thyself, Let us be gone. [takes her hand. Dir. And leave our son Olinthus? Where must he stay? Shall we depart without him? Timan. I will return for him when thou art in safety. Dir. Yet stayâfor yonder I behold approaching The royal guards. Timan. 'Tis true: then let us fly A different wayâthat passage too is barr'd, Another troop draws near. Dir. Unhappy Dirce! Timan. Do all my friends forsake me? [looking round. Dir. Cruel fate! What can we more? Timan. This sword shall hew thy passage: Follow me!â [going, meets Demo. SCENE XIV. Enter Demophoon, his sword drawn, Guards. Demo. Fly notâStay, unworthy son! Timan. My father! are you here against me too! Demo. Perfidious boy! Timan. Let none approach the victim. Dir. Yield, prince, think of thy safety. [aside to him. Demo. Noâforbear; Touch him not, guards, but give his madness way, And let us see how far it can transport him: Complete thy glorious deeds, here in this breast Plunge deep thy sword; thou canst not tremble, traitor, To pierce a father, when thy impious rage Has, in their temples, dar'd to insult the Gods! Timan. O Heaven! Demo. What is't withholds thee? Dost thou pause To see this weapon?âThus I cast it from me. What would'st thou more? Behold I offer here Thy greatest foe defenceless to thy rage. Now glut thy secret hate, let me be punish'd For giving birth to thee. Thou want'st but little To be supreme in wickedness; already Thou art travell'd far: it but remains to steep Thy daring weapon in a parent's blood, And give thy reeking hand to her thou lov'st. Timan. Enough, enough, my father! O forbear; These keen reproaches stab me to the soul. Behold this guilty weapon at your feet, Behold your son offending kneels before you. Take from him, if you will, this wretched life, But speak not thus. I know I have transgress'd, My fault's so great I dare not sue for pardon: Yet sure the bitter scourge of your resentment Is more than wretchedness like mine can bear. Dir. Ill-fated prince! What dost thou feel for me? [aside. Demo. Had I not proofs so glaring of his perfidy, He would seduce meâbut I'll hear no more. Yield, rebel! yieldâsubmit thy impious hands To slavish manacles. Timan. Where, where, my friends, [to the guards. Where are your chains? Behold these ready hands, For never shall the son refuse to obey The mandates of a just, offended father. Dir. Alas! my fears predicted but too true! [aside. Demo. Lead back the victim to the insulted God, Ye holy priests, and slay her in my presence. Timan. Alas! my life, I cannot now defend thee. [to Dirce. Dir. How many deaths this day must I endure Timan. My king! my father! Demo. Leave me! Timan. Yet have pity! Demo. Thou ask'st in vain. Timan. It never shall be said I suffer'd Dirce to be slain before me; At least defer the stroke: hear, reverend priests! My father hear! know Dirce ne'er can be The victim Heaven requiresâthe sacrifice Would prove a profanation. Demo. Speak, what mean'st thou? Timan. What does the God demand? Demo. A virgin's blood. Timan. Then Dirce must not here be led to death, She's weddedâshe's a motherâshe's my wife. Demo. Ha! Dir. How I tremble for him! [aside. Demo. Mighty Gods! What do I hear! ye priests, suspend the rites, Some other victim must be found. Are these The hopes I fondly cherish'd? Impious son! Respect'st thou thus divine and human laws? And dost thou comfort thus thy father's age? Dir. Let not your wrath, my lord, be turn'd on him: 'Tis I am guilty: these unhappy charms Caus'd all this wretchedness: 'twas I who studied Too much to please him; I, with female wiles, Seduc'd him first to love: 'twas I enforc'd him, With frequent tears, to these forbidden nuptials. Timan. Believe it not, my lordâit is not so: That she consented was my fault alone; By me was every artifice employ'd: A thousand times she banish'd me her sight, As often I return'd: I vow'd, entreated, Nay threaten'd, but in vain: at length she saw me Reduc'd to all the madness of despair; 'Till in her presence, with a desperate hand, My sword I drew, and menac'd even my life: Then pity forc'd her to consent. Dir. And yetâ Demo. Be silent bothâI find an unknown something Creep through my heart, that 'midst my just resentment, Would soften me to tenderness and pity: But, O! it must not be, their guilt's too great; 'Tis mine to give the world a bright example Of steady virtue and impartial justice. [aside. What, ho!âlet these be kept apart in prison 'Till we decree their fate. Timan. At least togetherâ Dir. At least together in our utmost sufferingsâ Demo. Yes, yes, ingrates! one fortune shall be yours. Perfidious pair! in life's estate Since love your hands could bind; Both shall partake one common fate, Nor be by death disjoin'd. Your crime was one; and both alike One punishment shall know; While just resentment now shall strike By me the impartial blow. [Exit. SCENE XV. Dirce, Timanthes, Guards. Dir. My lord! Timan. My wife! Dir. For me must thou be lost! Timan. And must thou die for me! Dir. Ah! who henceforth Will guard our child Olinthus! Timan. Cruel moment! Dir. Ah! thenâbut what avails it, prince, to sink In unbecoming weakness! Let our grief Be worthy of us; one short effort cuts This cruel knot; then let us part with firmness, Without complaining. Timan. Yes, bright excellence! I praise the generous thought: let not a sigh Escape us more. Dir. Now I am prepar'dâ Timan. And I Have steel'd my bosom. Dir. O! be strong my heart! Timan. Farewell, my Dirce! [they part with resolution, but at the entrance of the scene turn again to look at each other. Dir. Prince, farewell! Timan. My wife! Dir. Timanthes! Both. O ye powers! Dir. Why go'st thou not? Timan. Why dost thou turn again to gaze upon me? Dir. Fain would I see how thou canst bear thy pains. Timan. But yet thou weep'stâ Dir. And thou too sigh'st, Timanthes. Timan. O Heaven! how easy do we form resolves Before the trial comes! Dir. Alas! how well I thought my resolution fix'd: yet let me At least conceal my weakness from thy sight. Timan. Ah! stay, my life! hear me. Dir. What would'st thou say? Timan. Thou dearst object of my care, Instruct me how these woes to bear: Ah! reach thy hand at least to prove The last dear pledge of truth and love! Dir. This hand when fondly join'd to thine, Was once of happiness the sign: But now, those fleeting moments o'er, The sign of happiness no more! Both. Farewell thou treasure of my heart! Relentless fate, that bids us part, That dooms us ne'er to meet again! Can e'er malignant planets shed Worse evils on the guilty head, Than faithful love must now sustain? [Exeunt separately.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A prison. Timanthes, Adrastus. Timan. Be silentâcanst thou hope that Dirce dead, Timanthes will prolong his hated life By wedding with another? Why presum'st thou To affront my constancy? Adras. 'Tis she thou lov'st Now speaks by me; yes, Dirce bids me say That 'tis the last request she e'er shall make. Timan. Even the same love that urges her to ask, Forbids me to comply. Adras. And yetâ Timan. Enough. Adras. Reflect, my lordâ Timan. Adrastus, 'tis in vain; I'll hear no more. Adras. Compassion bids me try All means to save thee from the fate that threatens. Timan. Who speaks to me of life becomes my foe. Adras. Will thy breast no counsel move? Wilt thou then no succour find? Sure 'tis just thou ne'er should'st prove Tender pity from mankind. The wretch who sees with certain eyes Impending ruin round him wait, Yet not to 'scape the danger tries, Can justly ne'er complain of Fate. [Exit. SCENE II. Timanthes alone. Why should we covet life? What are its charms, For all degrees are wretched? Every state Partakes of misery. In infancy We tremble at a frown: in ripening youth We are made the sport of Fortune and of Love: In age we groan beneath the weight of years: Now we are tormented with the thirst of gain, And now the fear of loss: eternal war The wicked with themselves maintain; the just With fraud and envy. All our schemes are shadows, Vain and illusive as a sick man's dream! And when we but begin at last to know Our life's whole folly, death cuts short the scene: O then let death at onceâ SCENE III. Enter Cherinthus. Cher. My dearest prince! Come to my breast. [embraces him. Timan. What mean those looks compos'd, When thus you press me with a last embrace? Are these the tears due to a brother's death? Cher. What last embrace, what tears, what death, my brother? Thou art now the happiest of mankind: our father Forgets his indignation: all is past: He gives thee back his former tenderness, Thy spouse, thy son, thy liberty and life. Timan. O! hold, Cherinthus, even in pity hold; Such mighty raptures flow too fast upon me: Could I believe thee, sure my soul would faint With vast excess of pleasure! Cher. Doubt it not; My words are truth, Timanthes. Timan. Can it be! What friendly power could change my father's anger, When, parting from the temple, he resolv'd On mine and Dirce's death? Cher. Such was his purpose; And sure th'event had answer'd his resolve, Since all but prov'd in vain to appease his wrath: Even I, O prince! despair'd of safety for thee, When to thy aid Creusa cameâ Timan. Creusa! Creusa to my aid! she whom so late My scorn offended? Cher. Yes, the same Creusa: Thou dost not know, my brother, all the virtues Of that exalted fair: what said she not, What did she not to save thee! Thy deserts How did she raise! How did she speak to excuse Thy guilty rashness! Every means she tried To waken nature in a parent's heart: She made compassion, justice, public good, And glory plead for thee: for his example She shew'd herself offended yet forgiving, And touch'd his breast with shame. Soon as I saw The father's feelings warm'd by slow degrees, I flew (so Heaven inspir'd) to seek thy Dirce. I found her with Olinthus: instant both I hurried thence; and set before the king The mother and the son. This sight secur'd Our victory: for whether age subsided, Or that the affections of a parent now Exerted all their power, the king forgot His anger, rais'd his daughter from the ground, Then strain'd the guiltless infant in his arms, And mingled with the rest his pitying tears. Timan. O my lov'd brother! O my dearest father! Cherinthus, let us fly with speed to seek him. Cher. Not soâhe longs himself to bring thee first The grateful tidings; 'twill offend him much To see his fond design by me prevented. Timan. And has he then such kindness for a son Who yet so little has deserv'd his love? O how his goodness aggravates my crime! With shame I own it now: could I at least Discharge his promise to the Phrygian king: But thou, Cherinthus, may'stâThen save his honour, Give, in my stead, thy hand to fair Creusa, And calm to peace a parent's sinking age. Cher. What say'st thou, prince?âyes, let me now confess itâ Creusa is the mistress of my fate, I love her with the truest, tenderest passionâ But yetâ Timan. But what! Cher. I ne'er must hope Creusa Will deign to accept my hand: thou know'st she came To espouse the kingdom's heirâbut I am none. Timan. Is this the only bar? Cher. What needs there more To oppose my happiness? Timan. Then go, Cherinthus, Preserve my father's faithâthou art the heir. Cher. Who, I, my brother? Timan. Yes; thou would'st have been, Had not thy virtue snatch'd me from destruction: In yielding up my title to the throne, I give thee back but part of what thou gav'st. Cher. Our father thenâ Timan. At least he shall not blush To find his plighted faith to breach expos'd: And can I less for such a father's peace? What is a throne, compar'd with all the bliss His goodness heaps upon me? Cher. Yet his loss Is great who quits a crown. Timan. No, he who quits A crown, has something left he prizes more. Cher. How glorious in thy gift I find, The godlike virtues of thy mind! I envy not the regal state, But envy thee a soul so great. Thou bid'st a thousand passions rise; A thousand thoughts my heart surprise. At once I joy and wonder prove, And tender shame, and grateful love. [Exit. SCENE IV. Timanthes alone. My son! my wife! dear pledges of my peace! Part of myself! Is it then given me soon Fearless to clasp you in my fond embrace? And shall we then, without a future pang, Together lead our lives? Transporting thought! Now, now, I find that unexpected joy Can sooner raise, than grief depress the soul. SCENE V. Enter Mathusius with a paper in his hand. Mat. O prince! my lord! Timan. Art thou indeed Mathusius? If in yon' bark you stay'd for me in vainâ Mat. Enoughâthe place thou art found in must excuse thee. Timan. How did'st thou gain access to me? Mat. Cherinthus Procur'd me this admittance. Timan. Has he then Told thee my happiness? Mat. No; with impatience He broke from me, and flew I know not whither. Timan. O! I have wonders to relate, my friend! Mat. Perhaps thou may'st more wonders hear from me. Timan. Know, I'm this hour the happiest of mankind. Mat. Know, that this hour reveals a mighty secret. Timan. What secret? Mat. Hear, and own 'tis wondrousâDirce Is not my daughter; she's thy sister. Timan. Ha! My sister!âsure thou mock'st me! [disturbed. Mat. No, my prince, I mock thee not; thou did'st with her partake One common stock; one blood runs in your veins; One father and one mother gave you birth. Timan. O peace! what hast thou said!âForbid it Heaven! [aside. Mat. This paper yields the certain proofâ Timan. What paper? O give itâ [with impatience. Mat. Hear me first; my wife, when dying, Gave me this paper seal'd, and bade me swear Never to open it, unless some danger Should threaten Dirce. Timan. Wherefore, when the king This day condemn'd her to the sacrifice, Didst thou neglect it? Mat. Such a length of years Elaps'd, had blotted it from my remembrance. Timan. What brought it now to mind? Mat. When late for flight I gather'd all my treasures to the sea, Amidst my hoard I found it. Timan. Let me viewâ Mat. Yet stay. Timan. O Heaven! Mat. Thou know'st my consort bore Such faithful duty to the queen thy mother, That whom in life she lov'd, in death she follow'd. Timan. I know it well. Mat. See'st thou this regal signet? Timan. I do. Mat. Observe this writing; mark it well; Know'st thou the queen's own hand? Timan. I doâno moreâ Distract me not! Mat. Now read. [gives the paper. Timan. My trembling heart! [reads. âDirce is not the daughter of Mathusius, âBut springs from royal race, to me she owes âHer birth, and claims Demophoon for her father. âBy what event her fortune has been chang'd, âAnother secret paper must disclose; âLet this be sought for in the houshold temple, âBeneath the sacred footstool of the God, âTo which the king alone must dare approach. âMeantime let this suffice to prove her birth, âA queen confirms it with her oath. âArgea.â Mat. Thou tremblest, prince! Sure this is more than wonder! Why spreads that deadly paleness o'er thy face? Timan. Almighty powers! what dreadful stroke is this! [aside. Mat. Now tell me, prince, the happiness you boasted, Let me at leastâ Timan. Leave me, Mathusius, leave me. Mat. Why art thou troubled thus? thou'st gain'd a sister, And say is that so great a cause of sorrow? Timan. Leave me, in pity leave me to myself! Mat. How strangely various are the minds of men! The same event that fills one breast with joy, Distracts another with the pangs of grief. Good and ill are only names, Nothing real here we find: Each his pain or pleasure frames, As affection sways the mind. Every object changes hue, While ourselves the hues impart: As the passions, ever new, Turn to peace or war the heart. [Exit. SCENE VI. Timanthes alone. Ah! wretch! what coldness freezes at my heart! What dreadful aspect does my fate assume! I see, I see the source of all my woes; The wrath of Heaven pursued the unlawful nuptials. My hairs stand up with horror! What am I! What is the king!âBehold Olinthus now, Nephew and son! Dirce my wife and sister! Detested mixture, most unnatural kindred! Fly, fly, Timanthes, hide thee from mankind. Each hand will point at theeâthou now must prove Thy aged father's curse! How will thy story Be made the sport of fame! Unhappy Thrace, Behold thy Ådipus! in me behold The furies here renew'd of Thebes and Argos. O! that these eyes had never gaz'd on Dirce! What then I deem'd the violence of love Was but the voice of natureâI'm become A monster to myself! The light grows hateful! Each breath affrights me, earth appears to sink Beneath my trembling feet!âmethinks I hear Ten thousand thunders round me, while my crime With every object glares upon my sight! SCENE VII. Enter from different parts Creusa, Demophoon, Adrastus leading Olinthus by the hand, and Dirce. Creu. Timanthesâ Timan. Princess! ah! pursue me notâ Leave, leave me to myself. Demo. My dearest son. Timan. Ah! noâI must not hear that tender name. Creu. Perhaps thou know'st notâ Timan. O! I know too much. Demo. Receive this fond embrace, thy pledge of pardon: But say why dost thou shun thy father's arms? Timan. I dare not look on theeâ Creu. What can this mean? Demo. What has befallen thee?â Adras. See! behold your son: Be comforted, my lord. Timan. Take hence, Adrastus, Take hence that child, O! bear him from my sight. Dir. My much-lov'd lord!â Timan. Begone, avoid me, Dirce. Dir. And wilt thou drive me from thee on this day Of general joy? Timan. Where shall I fly to hide me! [going. Dir. O hold! Demo. Yet hear me! Creu. Stayâ Timan. 'Tis all in vain; You seek to ease, and stab me to the heart. Demo. But say, whom fly'st thou from? Timan. From men and Gods! From you and from myselfâ Dir. And whither go'st thou? Timan. Where the sun never shines, where nothing lives, Where my remembrance may be lost for ever! Demo. Think on thy father. Adras. On thy sonâ Dir. Thy wifeâ Timan. O speak not thus! Wife, father, son and brother, Are names endearing to a mind at peace; To me they are sounds of horror. Creu. Say the cause. Timan. Seek not to know itâdrown me in oblivion. Dir. By those dear moments when I pleas'd thee firstâ Timan. Dirce, forbearâ Dir. By all those solemn tiesâ Timan. O hold, in pity hold! Dir. If thou no more Regard'st thy wife, at least thy son may move thee: Look on himâ'tis the same that oft has touch'd Thy breast with tenderness: look on him still; 'Tis thy own bloodâ Timan. Would Heaven he were not so! Dirce. What crime could he commit that thus thou shunn'st him? Why dost thou turn away thy faceâO see, See how he reaches out his little hands, And speaks to thee with smiles of innocence! Timan. Ah! couldst thou now be sensible of that Which, hapless boy! thou must hereafter know, Thou wouldst not thus with fondness hover round me! Ill-fated child! thou canst not feel Thy future grief and shame: May never tongue thy birth reveal, Or tell thy father's name! Ye Gods! what sudden change I find! How soon my peace is fled! What late with rapture fill'd my mind, Is now my greatest dread! [Exit. SCENE VIII. Demophoon, Creusa, Dirce, Adrastus, Olinthus. Demo. Adrastus, follow himâ[Exit Adrastus, Olinthus is led off by an attendant.] Who can inform me, Amidst you all, what my Timanthes means, If frenzy or despair possess his mind? But wherefore do ye gaze with wonder on me, Yet speechless stand! O could I but discover What evil threatens, that my soul might stand Prepar'd to meet the worst. Almighty powers! Give me at least to know this secret danger. Distressful sounds invade my ear, I see thick smoke obscure the skies, Around the crackling ruins hear, Yet find not whence the flames arise. My terror makes my doubts the more, Amid my doubts my fears increase: Distracted thus, I lose the power To fly, if flight could save my peace. [Exit. SCENE IX. Creusa, Dirce. Creu. Say, Dirce, wherefore seem'st thou thus unmov'd, When, with thy husband, thou art made the theme Of every tongue?âGoâseek him, learn the causeâ Thou hear'st me notâWhy are thy languid eyes Cast down to earth?âShake off this lethargy. 'Tis madness to reject a friendly counsel: If more thou canst notâgive thy sorrows vent, At least lament aloud and break this silence. Dirce. How shall I speak to thee again, And in what words reply? I seek to oppose my fate in vain, I would, but cannot fly. My senses numb'd with sudden dread, No longer can complain; No tears, alas! have I to shed, No voice to tell my pain. [Exit. SCENE X. Creusa alone. What unbless'd region's this! why am I come To share in others' griefs? How many evils Has one unhappy day produc'd? Contention Between a son and father! Human victims, Polluted temples, and ill-omen'd nuptials! There wanted but the fear of unknown ills To make these woes complete. The wrath of Fate Is sure too mighty to continue long; It must relent: in such distressful fortune, Hope oft again revives from mere despair. Misfortunes cannot long remain, When once they've reach'd their full increase; And hope begins to dawn again, When terror rises to excess. All things must change beneath the sun; And since we're thus depress'd by Fate, We never can be more undone, But any change must mend our state. [Exit. SCENE XI. An apartment in the Palace, magnificently decorated for the nuptials of Creusa. Timanthes, Cherinthus. Timan. And whither, cruel, would'st thou lead me now? These splendid shows of pomp and joy augment The pangs of one abandon'd to despair. Cher. Methinks no longer I discern my brother: What means this weakness so unworthy of thee? If thou hast err'd, thou knew'st it not: 'tis true Thou art unhappy, but not criminal. All, all misfortunes may be lightly borne, When the soul feels not guilt. Timan. By deeds alone The world directs its censure; and when deeds Condemn us, reason tries in vain to absolve. But I'm too guilty; or if ignorance Extenuates my offence, I'm criminal In daring still to live; and yet I never Can banish Dirce hence; I feel I love her, I know I ought not: but, alas! so soon How can I hope to break the tender ties, Cast off the lover, husband and the father? Dissolve an union, dearer by misfortune; Forget our faith, obliterate the remembrance Of pleasures long enjoy'd? O Heaven! Cherinthus, Leave me, in pity leave me; let me die, Ere yet a greater guiltâ SCENE XII. Enter Adrastus. Adras. The king, Timanthes, Seeks thee in every part; but now I saw him With old Mathusius quit the houshold temple. A pleasure seems to brighten either's looks; For thee alone they ask. Timan. O! let me fly! Too much I dread to meet a father's sight! SCENE XIII. Enter Mathusius. Mat. My son! my dearest son! [embracing Timanthes. Timan. To me that name! Ha! wherefore! say? Mat. Because thou art my son, And IâI am thy father! Timan. Sure thou dream'st! SCENE XIV. Enter Dirce leading Olinthus. Timan. O! Heaven! Is Dirce here? Dir. Fly not, my lord, Nor fear in me a sister. Timan. You deceive me, To calm the tumult of my wounded thoughts! SCENE XV. Enter Demophoon attended. Demo. Thou art not deceiv'd, Timanthes; all is true. Timan. O to betray me now were cruelty! Demo. Yet be compos'd; for know thou art not my son. Thou, when an infant, wert exchang'd for Dirce: I am her father, and Mathusius thine. My consort begg'd thee of Mathusius' wife; For then she deem'd the public weal concern'd In this exchange: but when Cherinthus next Was born, too late she saw the rash design Had of succession robb'd her rightful son. To me she durst not tell the mighty secret, She found already thou had'st gain'd too much On my affection: but at length, reduc'd To life's extremest verge, she left the story Reveal'd in two mysterious papers; one She gave her friend, and that Mathusius shew'd thee; The other she conceal'd, and that thou here Beholdest. Timan. Wherefore did she not in one Disclose the mystery? Demo. Because she meant The first should only prove the birth of Dirce. It there suffic'd to swear she was her daughter. The secret of thy fate was kept for me; That I might act as best the time requir'd, Or to divulge, or keep it still unknown. For this the second paper she dispos'd, Where I alone could ever have access. Timan. Such strange events still hold my mind in doubt. Demo. Too certain are the proofs: behold the writing Where all I have declar'd is told at full. Timan. O Fortune! do not once again deceive me! [takes the paper and reads. SCENE LAST. Enter Creusa. Creu. May I, my lord! believe the joyful tidings That echo through the palace? Demo. Princess, yes: See there thy husband. I have pledg'd my faith To wed thee to my son, and kingdom's heir; And in Cherinthus now receive them both. Cher. The change may prove ungrateful to Creusa. Creu. In vain we hope to avoid what Heaven decrees. Cher. And wilt thou not confess thou lov'st Cherinthus? Creu. My deeds shall speak my thoughts. Timan. And was it me The oracle declar'd? Was I the unknown, The innocent usurper? Demo. Yes, thou wert. The clouds are now dispell'd; the kingdom stands Deliver'd from the annual sacrifice; And to the rightful heir the crown returns. I shall preserve, without the means of rigour, My faith unbroken to the Phrygian king: Cherinthus shall possess his lov'd Creusa: She shall a sceptre gain; and thou may'st now Securely clasp thy Dirce. Not a cause For grief remains, and all this wondrous maze Of mystic Fate, these papers have reveal'd. Timan. O! happy papers! fortunate Timanthes! Ye powers! from what a dreadful weight I feel My soul disburden'd! O my son! my wife! Come to my bosom: now I can embrace you Without the fear of guilt! Dir. Transporting hour! [kneels. Creu. What moving tenderness! Timan. Most just of kings! Once more behold me at your feet: forgive The wild excesses of despairing love; Believe me, when I swear it, you shall find me More duteous as your subject than your son. Demo. Rise, thou art still my son, still call me father; Such, while I live, thou'lt find me: till this hour Our love was duty, henceforth be it choice. A stronger tie shall our affections bind Than Nature's ties, the instinctive work of Fate. Chorus. Good fortune most delights mankind, That steals upon us, when the mind Can scarce its griefs sustain. What mortal bliss can prove sincere, Since, to be great, our pleasures here Must have their source in pain! END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
