      <field name="fulltext">PROVIDENCE: AN ORATORIO.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART THE FIRST. Recitative: Accompanied. Hail, wond'rous Being! who in pow'r supreme Exists from everlasting, whose great Name Deep in the human heart, and every atom The Air, the Earth, or azure Main contains, In undecypher'd characters is writtenâ Chorus. INCOMPREHENSIBLE! Air. Let, then, the Trumpet sound His praise, And choirs uniting plaudits raise; Let Cherubims on high proclaim, In Hymns of joy, th'Eternal's name. Recitative. Before this earthly Planet wound her course, Before âthe Morning-Stars together sang,â And hail'd Him Architect of countless worlds, He wasâall-glorious, all-beneficent, All Wisdom, Goodness and Omnipotence! Chorus. Songs of Adoration sing To the Universal King: Nature's great, creative Lord, Is by countless worlds ador'd. Recitative. Hear, Ignorance, and self-plum'd Vanityâ Distrustful and presumptuous Mortals, hear, The pow'r and greatness of the Living Lord. Air. When Chaos first in darkness lay, Unmov'd by his creative hand, He call'd forth Lightâand All was Day! Creation 'rose at his command. Recitative. Great was the Sceneâall-glorious to behold, The King of Worlds, cloath'd in resplendent light, Pleas'd with the works of His Almighty hand. Air. Air, Earth, and Seas confess His pow'r, As each by Wisdom's order came; The Planets, ruling ev'ry hour, Obedient own his mighty name: Birds, Insects, Plants, His pow'r display, And ev'ry living creature known; The Moon by night, the Sun by day, Revolving, His direction own. Chorus. His pow'r and greatness all proclaim'd around, Mountains and vallies felt the pleasing sound: From this great, universal Jubilee, Arose the laws and pow'r of Harmony. Air. Then Hymn His praise in songs of joy, The God of Worlds adore; Let Gratitude her pow'rs employ, 'Till Time shall be no more. Recitative. Man, He created sov'reign Lord of all, The fav'rite work of his all-pow'rful hand: Him, He endued with thought, and pow'r of speech, To Man, as Lord of all, His will was known, On him His choicest blessings were conferr'd, Fair Eden's blissful seat his fix'd abode, All earthly pleasures and eternal life. Air and Chorus. Awake up to glory, awake harp and lute, The sweet-sounding lyre, and the soft-breathing flute; Let the loud-pealing Organ, and shrill Trumpet sound, His greatness proclaim to the Universe round. Recitative. Still bent on mighty acts, cou'd ought retard Goodness, that knows no bounds, from blessing ever, Or keep th'immense Artificer in Sloth? Noâin th'exertion of His righteous pow'r, Ten thousand Times more active than the Sun, He reign'd, and with a mighty hand compos'd Systems innumerable, matchless all, All stampt with His uncounterfeited seal. Air. What tongue can speak His mighty pow'r, What words His praise declare? The theme's too high for man to soar; Weak Man must then forbear. Recitative. Since, then, for humble Man the task is vain, To speak Him as He is, who is Ineffable; Yet still let Reason thro' the eye of Faith View Him with fearful Love; let Truth pronounce, And Adoration on her bended knee, With Heav'n-directed hands confess His reign. And let th'Angelic, Archangelic band, With all the Hosts of Heav'n, Cherubic forms, And forms Seraphic, with their silver trumps, Their golden lyres, and their ten thousand tongues, Begin a grand thanksgiving to the Lord, Saying, Full Chorus. Hail, mighty King! to thee our songs we raise, Whose greatness soars beyond the flight of praise! END OF THE FIRST PART.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART THE SECOND. Recitative. Great is the Lord, and wonderful His pow'r! He measur'd in the hollow of His hand Th'exulting Ocean, and the highest Heav'ns He comprehended with a span, and weigh'd The mighty mountains in His golden Scales: He shone supreme, who was himself the light, Ere yet Refraction learn'd her skill to paint, And bend athwart the clouds her beauteous bow. Accompanied. Arise, Angelic choirs, and with new strains All Hymn your God; and thou, immortal Fame, Arise, and sound thy everlasting trump. Full Chorus. In songs of glory, hymns of praise, Let all their tuneful voices raise; And let Heav'n's mansions loudly ring With plaudits to th'Eternal King. Recitative: Accompanied. And thou, cherubic Gratitude, whose voice To pious ears sounds silverly so sweet, Come with thy precious incense, bring thy gifts, And with thy choicest stores the Altar crown. Air. Man bless'd beyond the reach of thought, Within the womb once lay conceal'd, 'Till Heav'n's high will its wonders wrought, And Life and God-like pow'rs reveal'd. Recitative. Yet, boast not, Man; presume not on thy pow'rs, For, thou art still imperfect, incorrect, Perfection infinite with God remains; He is the Being most supremely wond'rous, Uncircumscrib'd, unsearchable, profound, And estimable solely in Himself! Air and Chorus. In tuneful notes proclaim Th'Almighty's boundless Fame, Let sacred ardour glow; Let Harmony its force employ, Let choirs unite in songs of joy, And loudly raise, To sing his praise, From whom all blessings flow. Recitative. What is that secret pow'r, that guides the brutes, Which Ignorance calls Instinct? 'Tis from God, It is the operation of His hands Immediate, instantaneous; 'tis his wisdom, That glorious shines transparent thro' His works.â When Philomela, ere the cold domain Of crippled Winter 'gins t'advance, prepares Her annual flight, and in some poplar shade Takes her melodious leave, who then's her pilot? Who points her passage through the pathless void, To realms from us remote, to us unknown? Her science is the science of her God. Air. Observe the sage, industrious Ant, To her, thou sluggard, go; She guards against impending want, When winter threatens woe: By her example learn to live, Her conduct make thy own; For Heav'n directs her how to thrive, And all her labours crown. Recitative. Who taught the feather'd matron, that the Hawk Was hatch'd her foe, and liv'd by her destruction? Her own prophetic soul is active in her, And more than human providence her guardâ So the domestic animal, that guards, At midnight hours, Man's threshold, if oppress'd By sudden sickness, at his master's feet Begs not that aid his services might claim, But is his own physician, knows the case, And from th'emetic herbage works his cure. Air. Such wond'rous works hath God alone, For secrect purpose wrought; For acts like these Mankind must own, Beyond the reach of thought. Recitative. Avaunt, Conceit! Ambition, take thy flight Back to the Prince of vanity and air! Oh, 'tis a thought of energy most piercing, Form'd to make pride grow humble; form'd to force Its weight on the reluctant mind, and give her A true, but irksome image of herself.â Accompanied. Woeful vicissitude! when Man, fall'n Man, Who first from Heav'n, from gracious God himself, Learn'd knowledge of the Brutes, must know by Brutes, Instructed and reproach'd, the scale of being; By slow degrees from lowly steps ascend, And trace Omniscience upwards to its spring! Yet murmur not, but praiseâfor tho' we stand Of many a God-like privilege amerc'd By Adam's dire transgression, tho' no more Is Paradise our home, but o'er the portal Hangs in terrific pomp the burning blade; Still with ten thousand beauties blooms the Earth With pleasures populous, and with riches crown'd. Air. Choice blessings hath the Lord bestow'd, (To Him let incense burn) Far more than Virtue can deserve, Or Gratitude return. Recitative. Then, O ye People, O ye Sons of Men, Whatever be the colour of your lives, Whatever portion of itself his Wisdom Shall deign t'allow, still patiently abide, And praise Him more and more; nor cease to chant 'Till hoary Time his latest course hath run. Full Chorus. All Glory to th'Omniscient, and Praise, And Pow'r, and Domination in the Height! END OF THE SECOND PART.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART THE THIRD. Recitative: Accompanied. âTremble, thou earth!â th'anointed poet said, âAt God's bright presence, tremble, all ye mountains, âAnd all ye hillocks on the surface bound.â Chorus. Then once again, ye thunders, roll, The Muse with transport hears; Convulse the earth, from pole to pole, And shake the vaulted spheres. Recitative. 'Tis thy terrific voice; thou God of power, 'Tis thy terrific voice; all Nature hears it Awaken'd and alarm'd; she feels its force, In every spring she feels it, every wheel, And every movement of her vast Machine. Recitative: Accompanied. Behold! quakes Apennine, behold! recoils Athos, and all the hoary-headed Alps Leap from their bases at the God-like sound. But what is this, celestial tho' the note, And proclamation of the reign supreme, Compar'd with such as, for a mortal ear Too great, amaze the incorporeal worlds? But like the echo of the parting breeze, When Zephyr faints upon the lily's breast; But like the ceasing of some instrument, When the last ling'ring undulation Dies on the doubting ear, if nam'd with sounds So mighty! so stupendous! so divine! Air. Hark, when the Whirlwind rapid rides, Tempestuous all around; Earth, seas and sky, Before it fly; Thro' worlds invincible it strides, Swift as the Thunder's bound: So great its sway, Whole Worlds obey; From pole to pole, from shore to shore, Earth, seas and planets are no more. Recitative. At God's great, righteous power whole systems quake, And at His nod tremble ten thousand worlds. The West encounters East, and Notus meets In his career the Hyperborean blast. All Nature faints and dies;âwhile He supreme Stands stedfast in the center of the storm. Recitative: Accompanied. Wherefore, ye objects terrible and great, Ye thunders, earthquakes, and ye fire-fraught wombs Of fell Volcanos, whirlwinds, hurricanes, And boiling billows, hail! In chorus join To celebrate and magnify your Maker, Who yet in works of a minuter mould Is not less manifest, is not less mighty. Chorus. Then celebrate his praise, who is, and was, And in immortal prowess King of Kings, Shall be the monarch of all Worlds for ever. Recitative. Immense Creator! whose all-pow'rful hand Fram'd universal Being, and whose Eye Saw, like thyself, that all things form'd were good, Each soul is fill'd with gratitude and Thee. Recitative: Accompanied. Raise swelling notes round the Cathedral's dome, And grace th'harmonious choir, celestial feast To pious ears, and med'cine of the mind; The thrilling trebles and the manly base Join in accordance meet, and with one voice All to the sacred subject suit their song. Air and Chorus. Bow down, ye stately cedars, low, Ye Elephants, submissive bow; Whole worlds shall God's great goodness ownâ To worlds his excellence is known. Recitative. What tho' th'Almighty's regal throne be rais'd High o'er yon azure Heav'n's exalted dome, By mortal eye unken'dâwhere East, nor West, Nor South, nor blust'ring North, has breath to blow: Albeit He there with Angels, and with Saints, Hold conference, and to his radiant host Ev'n face to face stand visibly confest: Yet know, that nor in Presence or in Pow'r, Shines he less perfect here; 'tis Man's dim eye That makes th'obscurity. He is the same, Alike in all his Universe the same. Air. The knee, which he has shap'd, shall bend, The tongue, which He has tun'd, shall praise; Whole worlds, 'till worlds themselves have end, The song of Gratitude shall raise. Recitative. But, O supreme, unutterable mercy! O love unequal'd mystery immense, Which Angels long t'unfold! 'tis man's redemption That crowns thy glory, and thy pow'r confirms, Confirms the great, th'uncontroverted claimâ When from the Virgin's unpolluted womb Shone forth the Sun of Righteousness reveal'd, And on benighted reason pour'd the day. Accompanied. Let there be peace, (he said) and all was calm Amongst the warring worldâcalm as the sea, When, O be still, ye boisterous Winds, he cry'd, And not a breath was blown, nor murmur heard. Unaccompanied. His was a life of miracles and might, And charity and love, ere yet he taste The bitter draught of death, ere yet he rise Victorious o'er the universal foe, And Death, and Sin, and Hell in triumph lead. His by the right of conquest is mankind; And in sweet servitude and golden bonds We're ty'd to him for ever.âO, how easy Is his ungalling Yoke, and all his burdens 'Tis ecstasy to bear! Him, blessed Shepherd, His flocks shall follow thro' the maze of life, And shades that tend to Day spring from on high; And as the radiant roses after fading In fuller foliage, and more fragrant breath, Revive in smiling spring, so shall it fare With those that love himâfor sweet is their savour, And all eternity shall be their spring. Air. Their bliss shall boast undying bloom, From jarring passions freed, Nor dubious hope, nor anxious gloom, For so hath Fate decreed. Recitative. Then join the general chorus of all worlds, And let the song of charity begin, In strains seraphic, and melodious pray'r. Accompanied. âO, all-sufficient, all-beneficent, Thou God of Goodness and of Glory, hear! Thou, who to lowliest minds dost condescend, Assuming passions to enforce thy laws, Adopting jealousy to prove thy love: Unaccompanied. Thou, who resign'd humility uphold, Ev'n as the florist props the drooping rose, But quell tyrannic pride with peerless pow'r, Ev'n as the tempest rives the stubborn oak. Accompanied. O, all-sufficient, all-beneficent, Thou God of Goodness and of Glory hear!â Full Chorus. Bless all Mankind, and bring them pure and free, To Heav'n, to Immortality, and Thee. Hallelujah. Amen.
