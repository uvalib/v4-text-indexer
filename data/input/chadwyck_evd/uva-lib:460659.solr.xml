      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE.—A Room splendidly furnished. Madame Pernelle, Elmire, Mariane, Cléante, Damis, Dorine, and Flipete, discovered. Mad. P. Come, Flipete, come, and let me free myself From such society. Elm. You walk so fast, One scarce can follow you. Mad. P. I pray you, don't— Daughter-in-law, advance not one more step; I ask not for these outward compliments. Elm. We only show a due respect, no more. But, mother, why should you depart so soon? Mad. P. Because I hate the manner of this house— Because none care to suit my principles. I leave you—yes—and badly edified. I give advice and find it is contemn'd; Nought is respected—each one lifts his voice— In short, a perfect Babel is this house. Dor. If— Mad. P. Stop, young woman: for a lady's maid, You talk too much—are too impertinent; You have opinions about everything. Dam. But— Mad. P. Grandson, you're a fool, a blockhead, sir; I tell you so, and I'm your grandmother. Long to your father have I prophesied That you would prove a good-for-nothing wight— An awful plague to his declining years. Mar. I think— Mad. P. You think!—yes, grand-daughter, of course You mean no harm—you look so innocent; But stillest waters are the deepest, child;— With that prim air you lead a sorry life. Elm. But, mother— Mad. P. Be not anger'd when I say Your conduct—in a word—is scandalous. You ought to set a patern to these cits. Their mother—rest her soul!—was more discreet, You're too expensive—I detest this show; In truth, you are trick'd out like some princess. A virtuous woman, who would only please Her husband, needs not all this finery. Cle. But madam, after— Mad. P. As her brother, sir, I look on you with all respect and love; But were I in my son's, her husband's, place, I should request your absence from this house. Unceasingly you utter principles Such as all honest people should eschew. I speak a little freely—'tis my way— When my heart's full, I do not pick my words Dam. Monsieur Tartuffe is happy, beyond doubt. Mad. P. A worthy man, whom every one should hear; And if a dolt like you says but one word Against that man, let him beware my rage. Dam. Shall I allow this carping censor, here, Within this house—to play the despot, madam, So that we must not e'en amuse ourselves Without obtaining the good man's consent? Dor. If we must take his maxims for our law, We can do nothing that is not a crime; This rigid critic would control us all. Mad. P. He who controls is well controll'd himself: He would conduct you on the path to Heaven. And, mark me, son, you all should try to love him. Dam. He's not my father—he's not any thing That I should take such pains to wish him well; My heart forbids me to speak otherwise. His conduct, madam, so awakes my wrath, That I foresee some noisy consequence. I shall talk plainly with this gentleman. Dor. Assuredly it is most scandalous To see a stranger play the master thus. A beggar, who came here with shoeless feet, Whose garments were not worth a single sou— A man like this can so forget himself, That he would rule the house in everything; Mad. P. Alas, alas! much better would it be If all were govern'd by his pious words. Dor. Oh yes, I know you fancy him a saint; But all he does is mere hypocrisy. Mad. P. There's tongue— Dor. Without the best security, I would not trust him, or his serving man. Mad. P. Nought can I say about the serving man; But for the master,—he's a worthy soul; You only scoff at him, and wish him ill, For speaking truth to plainly to you all. Sin only stirs his anger—nothing else! All that impels him is the cause of heav'n. Dor. Granted—but why,—especially of late, Can he not bear a single visitor? Is Heav'n so anger'd by a harmless visit, That he should raise a storm to split our ears? Shall I explain my views upon this head? I think he's jealous of my lady (points to Elmire) here. Mad. P. Hush, hold your tongue; speak not such mischief, girl. These visits are not blam'd by him alone. The noise that follows these same visitors, The coaches stationed ever at the gate, The throng of footmen, always riotous, Make quite a turmoil in the neighbourhood. I hope, indeed, there is no weighty harm— But folks will chatter, and that's not so well. Cle. Well, madam, can we stop the chattering? Believe me, life would be a poor affair, If, to escape each blockhead's cank'rous tongue, We were obliged to give up our best friends: And even if we did so, do you think We should compel the world to hold it's peace? There is no rampart against calumny; So let us take no heed of foolish talk, But try to be as virtuous as we can, And let the scandal-mongers talk at will. Dor. Our neighbour Daphne and her little spouse,— Those, I will wager, speak the worst of us. For those whose acts are most ridiculous Are ever first to censure all the rest. They never fail to snatch, with eager grasp, The least suspicion of a tender tie, Then joyfully disseminate their news, And give the fact what colouring they please. From other's actions—as they paint them, mind— They think to draw a license for their own, Fasely believing that some slight resemblance Will make their own intrigues seem innocent, Or that their neighbour's shoulders may have part Of the huge load of censure which they bear. Mad. P. These arguments are nothing to the point. Orante, you know, leads quite a model life; She cares for nought but heav'n, and I have heard She much condemns the throng who visit here. Dor. Oh, admirable pattern! Worthy lady! I grant the life she leads is most austere. But age has raised this ardour in her soul, Her tott'ring frame has taught her prudery. As long as she could captivate a heart, She turned her beauty to the best account; But when the lustre faded from her eyes, She fled a wicked world—that quitted her; And now beneath the pompous mask of wisdom She hides the weakness of her faded charms. This is the way with all our fine coquettes, They cannot bear to see their lovers go; By all deserted, their unquiet souls Can find no other trade than that of prude. Such is the rigour of these pious dames; They censure all, show clemency to none. Against their neighbours loudly they exclaim, By envy, not by charity, impell'd; Unwilling any those delights should share The taste for which age quenches in themselves. Mad. P. This is the sort of talk that pleases you, Daughter-in-law. Here one must hold one's peace. This lady lets no tongue wag but her own; Still I'll attempt to edge in a few words: I say my son ne'er did a wiser thing Than in receiving this most holy man. He was a special gift of Providence, Bestow'd to lead your wand'ring souls aright, One whom you ought to hear for your own good— One who blames nought but that which merits blame. Those balls, those visits, and those conversations, Are all devices of the Evil One. There we ne'er hear an edifying word; But idle tattle, songs, frivolities. Our neighbours, too, are oft a fruitful theme,— The art of scandal is well understood. Rational people feel their brains annoy'd By the confusion such assemblies make, Setting in motion chatt'ring tongues by scores. [Pointing to Cleante. Oh! this fair gentleman begins to yawn! Look out for fools who may amuse you, sir. Daughter-in-law (to Elmire), no more have I to say, Except that I lightly esteem this house, And 'twill be long 'ere I intrude again. Come, you minx, who stand idly gaping there, (to Flipete.) Op'ning your great dull eyes; come, come, I say, I'll make your ears ring. [Boxes ears. [Exeunt all but Cléante and Dorine, C. Cle. Here's a breeze for nought. It seems her head is turned by this Tartuffe. Dor. Oh, this is nothing to the son, good sir! Did you see him you would cry—well a-day! In our late troubles he showed good discretion And was most valiant in his prince's cause; But now he is so taken with Tartuffe It seems that all his faculties are dull. He calls Tartuffe his brother, loves him more,— Far more than mother, daughter, son, or wife. To him alone his secrets he entrusts, And makes him of his actions the sole guide. To him he leaves the highest place at table, And loves to see him eat as much as six; All the prime cuts are given to Tartuffe. In short, your brother's mad about him, sir, Worships him always, talks of nothing else, And thinks whate'er he does a miracle. Tartuffe, who knows his dupe, to gain his ends, Employs a thousand wiles to dazzle him— Piously coaxing forth some good round sums, And boldly passing censure on us all. Enter Elmire, Mariane, and Damis, C. Elm. You were most fortunate that you escaped The lesson which she gave us at the door. I've seen my husband, but he saw not me, And therefore I shall wait for him up stairs. Cle. I shall wait here, to save all loss of time, And only mean to wish him a good day. [Exeunt Elmire and Mariane, L Dam. Just touch upon the marriage of my sisters— Tartuffe, methinks, is raising obstacles. You know my interest in that affair— I wish Valère successful in his love, Because, you know, his sister has my heart; And if— Dor. He's coming. [Exit Damis, C. Enter Orgon, C. Org. Brother, a good day. Cle. Gladly I welcome you on your return. The country is not very forward yet? Org. Dorine—nay, brother, wait awhile, I pray; You will allow me just to calm my mind, And ask how things are going on at home. Well—(to Dorine)—well, has all been right these last few days? What are you doing—are you all quite well? Dor. My lady yesterday was indisposed, And had a headache—such a headache, sir! Org. And Tartuffe—? Dor. Tartuffe, nothing ails Tartuffe; He's fat and sleek—in excellent good case. Org. Poor soul! Dor. Last night she lost her appetite, And would not touch a morsel at her supper, So much her aching head distracted her. Org. But Tartuffe—? Dor. Supp'd alone before her face. He eat two partridges most piously, And half a leg of mutton hash'd, besides. Org. Poor soul! Dor. My lady could not close her eyes For one short moment all the tedious night; We had to wait on her till break of day. Org. But Tartuffe—? Dor. Had a most refreshing sleep; He left his supper for his chamber, sir, And jump'd at once into his nice warm bed, Where, at his ease, he slumber'd till the day. Org. Poor soul! Dor. At last, yielding to our entreaties, My lady, sir, consented to be bled, And her poor head was freed from pain at once. Org. But Tartuffe—? Dor. He got up as brave as ever. To fortify his soul against all harm, And to regain the blood my lady lost, He drank for breakfast four good cups of wine. Org. Poor soul! Dor. At present they are both quite well, And I will haste to tell my lady, sir, The int'rest you have taken in her health. [Exit L. Cle. Good brother, she is laughing in your face, And—mind I mean to give you no offence— I frankly say she has a right to laugh. Did e'er one hear of such a senseless whim? What, now-a-days, a man can bear a charm To make you forget all, except himself? What, after having help'd him in his troubles You go so far that— Org. Stop, good brother, stop— You do not know the man of whom you speak. Cle. I do not know him—you may have it so; Indeed to learn what sort of man he is— Org. Nay, if you did, I'm sure you would be charm'd- Oh there would be no end to your delight; He is a man who—yes, he is a man Who follows what he teaches; keeps his soul Most tranquil; looks upon the world as dross. Through his discourse I'm quite another being; He teaches me to set my heart on nought; From all affection he has freed my soul, And I could see wife, mother, children die, And deem the loss not worth a passing thought. Cle. Such sentiments, I own, are most humane. Org. If you had seen him as I met him first Your feelings would have been the same as mine. With a meek air he daily came to church, And in my sight dropp'd humbly on his knees. The fervent zeal with which he breath'd his pray'rs Attracted the regards of ev'ry one; His sighs were deep, most heavy were his groans, And on the ground he ever press'd his lips. Instructed by his man—his worthy copy Of his high merits and his poverty,— A trifle I bestowed on him; but he Would ever modestly return a part. “This is too much,” he'd say, “too much by half— I do not merit your compassion, sir.” And when I would not take it back again, He gave it to the poor before my eyes. At length, thank Heav'n! he came to live with me, And from that happy hour I've prosper'd well. He manages my house—deep interest takes In all my wife does—for my honour's sake, He tells me who regards her with soft looks, Appearing far more jealous than myself. You can't conceive the measure of his zeal. The smallest bagatelle he deems a sin. 'Tis but the other day he blamed himself Because at pray'rs he caught a flea, and kill'd it With too much anger. Cle. Brother, you are crazed, Or think to mock me with this strange discourse. What can you mean? This tissue of mad stuff— Org. Brother, this language is a little free— I fear you're not quite right within your soul; And, as I've told you twenty times before, You'll draw some sad misfortune on your head. Cle. This is the common talk of all your class, Who wish the world no wiser than themselves. 'Tis impious, so they think, to have good eyes; And he who will not worship vain pretence Has no respect or faith in sacred things. Talk as you will, you cannot frighten me; Heav'n sees my heart, and as I speak, I act; We are not all the slaves of hypocrites. There are false saints, besides false heroes, man; And as we find, when honour leads the way, The truly valiant make not the most noise; So the true devotees, whom we should follow, Are not the folks who make the longest face. What, brother, no distinction can you draw Between devotion and hypocrisy— Must you respect the mask as 'twere the face, Esteem the phantom as the real man, And worthless counters as the current coin? Men are, in general, most strangely made; We rarely find them in the proper track— The limits reason sets they find too strait, And go to wild extremes in everything. The noblest principles they often spoil, Because they wish to carry them too far. Org. Oh! you are doubtless a most rev'rend doctor, Comprising all the wisdom of the world; You only are enlighted—the sole sage— An oracle—the Cato of our time, While all mankind but you, are empty fools. Cle. I am not, brother, a most rev'rend doctor, Comprising all the wisdom of the world; My sum of science, in one word, is this— I can distinguish between true and false; And as I think there is no kind of hero Merits more praise than the true devotee, That there is nothing nobler in the world Than the pure fervour of a pious zeal; So do I find nought more detestable Than the false plaster of affected zeal. Those folks, whose soul obeys their interest— Who make devotion a mere merchandize, Seeking their fortune on the road to heav'n;— Who, 'mid their pray'rs, are begging ev'ry day, And preach the charms of solitude, at Court— Who to their vices aptly fit their zeal, Are quick, revengeful, faithless, full of trick And, to destroy their fellows, cloak their malice By feigning ardor for the cause of heav'n; All the more dang'rous in their savage wrath, Because we must respect the arms they use, Because they strike their blows with sacred steel;— Too oft we see impostors of this kind, But still the really good may be discern'd. Our age, my brother, sets before our eyes Many whom we might use as bright examples— Many who of their virtues make no boast, But who, although devout, are still humane; They do not judge severely all we do, But deem there's much presumption in such censure; Leaving to others their censorious pride— They only shame our actions by their own. People like these should be our pattern, brother, This friend of yours is of another mould. Org. Brother-in-law, you've finished your discourse? Cle. I have. Org. (bows.) Your humble servant. Cle. One word more— We'll change the subject. As you know, Valère Has got your word to be your son-in-law. Org. True. Cle. You had fix'd upon the happy day. Org. Most true again. Cle. Why, then, defer the wedding? Org. I cannot say. Cle. Have you some other thought? Org. Perhaps I have. Cle. What! would you break your word? Org. I said not that. Cle. No obstacle, I hope, Will cause you to commit a breach of faith. Org. Why, that's according— Cle. To the point at once— 'Tis at Valère's request that I am here. Org. May Heav'n be prais'd! Cle. What answer shall I take? Org. E'en what you please. Cle. Let us speak plainly, brother; The word you've given, will you keep or no? Org. Good-bye. [Exit, L. Cle. I fear his love will meet some check— I must inform the youth of all that's passed. [Exit, C. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Same Scene. Enter Orgon and Mariane, L. Org. Mariane! Mar. Father. Org. Hither, child; I wish To speak with you alone. (Looks in closet, R.) Mar. What is't you seek? Org. I take precautions lest we be o'erheard; This for an ambush is the very spot. Good! All seems right; so now, my Mariane— I've always seen in you a placid mind, And you have ever been most dear to me. Mar. I owe my thanks for this paternal love. Org. Well said, my child—and to deserve this love Your only care should be to please your father. Mar. That is the only object of my life. Org. Well said again. What think you of Tartuffe, Our guest? Mar. I! Org. You—mind well your answering, child. Mar. So be it—all that you require I'll say. Enter Dorine, softly. Org. A good beginning. You will say, my child, That in his person lofty merit shines— That he has touched your heart—that you would like, With my consent, to have him for a husband. Well? Mar. Well? Org. What? Mar. Pray? Org. Proceed. Mar. There's some mistake. Org. Mistake! Mar. Of whom, pray, would you have me say That he has touched my heart; that I should like, With your consent, to have him for a husband. Org. Tartuffe. Mar. Why, nothing of the sort I feel; You would not have me so belie myself. Org. I wish that this should be the honest truth; And that I wish it, is enough for you. Mar. You don't mean, father— Org. Daughter, yes—I mean That worthy Tartuffe shall belong to us By marrying you—this—this I have resolv'd And as I—(sees Dorine)—You! What are you doing there? Your curiosity is somewhat strong, That in this fashion you are eaves-dropping Dor. Indeed I know not if the rumour came From mere conjecture, or some passing chance. Of this same marriage I have been informed, And thought the news an idle tale—no more. Org. Is it incredible? Dor. To that degree, That when you tell it, sir, I can't believe you. Org. I know the means then to ensure your faith. Dor. Yes, yes, I hear—a very pleasant tale. Org. I but predict what you will shortly see. Dor. A jest! Org. No, what I'm saying is no jest. Dor. (to Mariane.) Nay, take no heed of what your father says, He's joking— Org. I! Dor. Protest howe'er you please, None will believe you, sir. Org. My rage at last— Dor. Well, you shall be believed—the worse for you. What, is it possible, with that wise air, And that large beard upon your countenance, That you are mad enough to wish— Org. Stop—stop— You take a certain license in this house Which does not please me. This I tell you, child. Dor. Nay, I entreat, let's keep our temper, sir; A bigot is no husband for your child; Some other object should employ his thoughts. Then—from this union what would you derive? Why do you set about, with all your wealth, To choose a beggar for a son-in-law? Org. Silence! if he has nothing, you should know That from that very cause he claims respect; There is an honor in his poverty Which raises him above all worldly greatness, Seeing that he has merely lost his wealth By taking little care of temp'ral things. My aid, too, will supply him with the means Of getting rid of his embarrassments And gaining his estates—they're fiefs of worth, And you may plainly see he's gently born. Dor. Yes, yes, he says so, and this vanity Accords but little with his saintly air. He who adopts a pure and holy life Should not so greatly boast of name and birth. Why so much pride? But this offends you, sir, We'll talk not of his birth, but of himself. Can you, without some slight uneasiness, Give up your daughter to a man like him? Should you not think, sir, of propriety, And see, this marriage may have bad results? The virtue of a girl is perill'd, sir, When she is forced to wed against her will. The resolution of a virtuous life Upon the husband's qualities depends, And those the world esteems—unfortunate, Have often caused the error of their wives. Fidelity is not a little hard With certain husbands of a certain stamp. Whoever gives his child to one she hates Owes an account to Heav'n for all her faults. Org. Daughter, pay no attention to this talk; I am your father—know what you require; Your hand, indeed, I promised to Valère, But he, I hear, is somewhat giv'n to play, And his opinions are a little free; I do not find he often goes to church. Dor. What! would you have him ever running there, Like those who go on purpose to be seen? Org. I ask not your advice upon that point. Tartuffe, I know, has virtue beyond price; This marriage gives you all you can desire— 'Twill be compos'd of nought but peace and joy; Link'd by your pure affections, you will live Like happy children—like two turtle doves, No sad dispute will ever mar your bliss, But you will make your husband what you please. Dor. She'll make of him a fool, I promise you. Org. Fie! Here's discourse! Dor. I know it by his look. Org. Truce to these interruptions—hold your tongue, And meddle not with what concerns you not. Dor. 'Tis only for your good, sir, that I speak. Org. You're far too kind—so, once more, hold your tongue. Dor. If no one lov'd you— Org. I want no one's love. Dor. Spite of yourself, I still will love you. Org. Ha! Dor. Your honor's dear to me—I cannot bear To see you make yourself a public jest. Org. You won't be silent? Dor. 'Twere a heinous sin To let you form connections such as this. Org. Impudent viper, will you hold your tongue? Dor. Good as we are, we lose our tempers, sir. Org. My bile is stirr'd by this impertinence; And you shall hold your tongue, I am resolv'd. Dor. So be it, but I shall not think the less. Org. Think what you please, but take the greatest care Just to say nothing. (to Mariane.) Like a prudent man, I have maturely weigh'd all things. Dor. I burst With rage to think I cannot speak. Org. Tartuffe Is no Adonis—still— Dor. A pretty phiz! Org. And even if you felt no sympathy For all his other gifts— Dor. A precious lot! [Orgon turns round to Dorine, and with folded arms looks round into her face. If I were in her place, no man on earth Should force me with impunity to wed. Org. (to Dorine.) You set no value, then, on my commands? Dor. Why blame me, sir? I do not speak to you Org. To whom, pray, are you talking? Dor. To myself. Org. Good. (aside.) To chastise her, for her impudence, I've got a good strong hand in readiness. [Gets ready to box Dorine's ears, and cautiously turns round to her, while she keeps silent. Daughter, my plan should meet with your approval— You ought to think the husband I have chosen— (to Dorine.) Why don't you speak? Dor. I've nothing more to say. Org. A little word? Dor. Thank you, I'd rather not. Org. I watch'd you sharply. Dor. I may be a fool. Org. In short, my daughter, you must be obedient, And to my choice pay perfect deference. Dor. But not the fool to take a spouse like that. [steps aside, to escape a box on the ear which is aimed at her by Orgon. Org. That girl, my daughter, is a perfect pest— I even hold it sin to live with her. I cannot now pursue her any more, Her insolence has set me quite on fire. I'll take a little air to cool myself. [Exit, C. Dor. Tell me, pray, have you lost the pow'r of speech? Am I to play your part in this affair? What! listen to a senseless plan like this, And not so much as speak a single word! Mar. What should I do against a father's will? Dor. All that you can to parry such a blow. Mar. How? Dor. Tell him hearts don't love by deputy— That for yourself you marry, not for him— That since the whole affair, in fact, is yours, 'Tis you, not him, the husband ought to please. Mar. A parent has so much authority, I ne'er have had the courage to object. Dor. Let's reason. Young Valère is somebody— Now, do you love the youth, or do you not? Mar. Oh! this is sad injustice to my love! How could you ask that question—how, Dorine? To you so often I unlock my heart, And still my feelings are unknown to you! Dor. You love him, then? Mar. Yes, with my very soul. Dor. And he appears to feel as much for you? Mar. I think so. Dor. And you equally desire To marry one another? Mar. Certainly. Dor. What is your plan with this new marriage scheme? Mar. To kill myself, if they would force my will. Dor. Wisely resolved—I never thought of that. Death, to be sure, will help you from the scrape. A marv'lous remedy! I feel enrag'd While giving ear to such absurdity. Mar. Why—what a temper you begin to show; You have no pity for a suff'ring heart. Dor. I do not pity people who talk—stuff, And show so little nerve when danger calls. Mar. What would you? If I feel timidity— Dor. There should be firmness in a heart that loves. Mar. And have not I shown firmness for Valère? 'Tis now his duty to persuade my father. Dor. What! If your father is a crabbed soul, So much wrapp'd up in this same dear Tartuffe, That he can break his word about your marriage, Your hapless lover is to bear the blame? Mar. Still by a bold refusal should I show That I have so much compromis'd my heart? What e'er Valère's deserts may be, should I Forget all duty, and all modesty? You would not have me, before all the worl Dor. I would have nothing—you, I plainly see, Would have Tartuffe, and I am very wrong In trying to break off so good a match,— Aye, I confess, a very proper match. Monsieur Tartuffe, when we consider right, Is not a man for everybody's market— A blessing it must be to be his wife; A noble man—a very well made man— A good complexion, and a comely mien. Oh, such a spouse is too much happiness! Mar. For mercy's sake, no more of this discourse, But help me to avert this hated marriage; I yield myself entirely to your will. Dor. No, no; a daughter must obey her sire, E'en if he choose a monkey for her spouse. Mar. You're killing me; advise me, I entreat. Dor. Your humble servant. Mar. Nay, for pity's sake— Dor. This marriage should take place to punish you. Mar. My good Dorine— Dor. No— Mar. If my fondest wish— Dor. Monsieur Tartuffe's the man, and you shall have him. Mar. You know you always were my confidant. Dor. You to your heart's content shall be “Tartuff'd.” Mar. Well, since you take no pity on my lot, Abandon me henceforth to my despair, From that alone my heart shall borrow aid. I know a remedy for all my ills. [Going, L. Dor. No! Stop! Come back! I give up all my rage. In spite of all, I must be merciful. Mar. Mark, rather than endure such martyrdom, I tell you plainly, I will die, Dorine. Dor. Now, don't torment yourself—a little tact Will be sufficient. Hold! here comes Valère. Enter Valere, C. Val. Madam, I have been told a piece of news, Which, I suppose, I must consider good. Mar. What is it, pray? Val. That you will wed Tartuffe Mar. My father certainly has such a plan. Val. Your father? Mar. Has a little changed his views; Only just now he has proposed the match. Val. What, seriously? Mar. Yes, no doubt of that— Upon this marriage he has set his heart. Val. And, whither do your inclinations tend, Madam? Mar. I do not know. Val. A frank reply— You do not know? Mar. No; what do you advise? Val. I—I! To take the husband, by all means. Mar. You counsel this? Val. Yes. Mar. Honestly? Val. Of course; All must respect so excellent a choice. Mar. Good sir, I'll follow this most sage advice. Val. And, as I think, without the slightest pain. Mar. No more, sir, than you felt in giving it. Val. I only gave it, madam, to please you. Mar. And to please you, sir, I shall follow it. Val. So, this is love—and all was mere deceit When you— Mar. Nay, I entreat, no more of that. You plainly tell me that I ought to take The husband whom my father offers me; And I declare, that thus I mean to act, Since with such wisdom you have counsell'd me. Val. Let not my counsels furnish your excuse, Your resolution was already form'd, And you would seize a frivolous pretext To justify a flagrant breach of faith. Mar. Most truly spoken. Val. Doubtless—and your heart Has never beat for me with real love. Mar. You are quite free to harbour these fine thoughts. Val. Quite free, no doubt; but it is possible That I may lead the way, not follow, madam— I know where I can take my hand and heart. Mar. I do not doubt you, merit such as yours Must surely— Val. Psha! no more of that, I pray. My merit's small enough, as you have proved: It is on kindness, madam, I depend. I know a heart that, when I am repuls'd, Will be most ready to repair my loss. Mar. A loss, no doubt, most easy to be borne: You will be able to console yourself. Val. I'll do my best, and you will bear in mind A heart that slights us summons forth our pride, And to forget it, we must take all pains: And if we fail, why, then—then we must break it; For nothing can be baser than a man, Who loves the woman that abandons him. Mar. A sentiment most noble and sublime. Val. Most true, and one that all men should adopt. What, I, forsooth, must keep my flame alive, While you are to another's arms consign'd, Nor give elsewhere a heart that you despise! Mar. Nay, on the contrary, I think with you, And only wish the thing were done already. Val. You wish so? Mar. Yes. Val. This insult is too much. I can oblige you madam; yes, at once. [Going, C. Mar. Good, very good. Val. Remember, 'tis yourself By whom my heart is forced to such extremes. Mar. I do. Val. And mind, I only form this plan To follow your example. Mar. Be it so. Val. Enough, you shall most strictly be obeyed. Mar. Excellent! Val. You will never see me more. [Going. Mar. That's better still. Val. (turning back.) Eh! Mar. What! Val. You call'd me back. Mar. I! you are dreaming. Val. So. Then I'll depart. Madam, farewell. Mar. Farewell, sir. Dor. For my part, I think you soon will drive each other mad. Come, I have let you quarrel all this time To see how far absurdity would go. Monsieur Valère. [Takes his arm. Val. (pretending to struggle.) What would you have, Dorine? Dor. Come here. Val. Not I, 'tis not my humour—no. Prevent me not from following her will. Dor. Stop. Val. No. You may perceive my mind's made up. Dor. Ah! Mar. Yes, my presence drives him from the spot— 'Twere best for me to leave him to himself. Dor. (leaves Valère and runs to Mariane.) 'Tis your turn now! Mar. Leave me! Dor. I say, come back. Mar. Not I, Dorine, your efforts are in vain. Val. I see my very aspect tortures her; 'Twere best I should relieve her of my presence. Dor. (leaves Mariane and runs to Valère.) Again! Deuce take ye both. I'll have my way. Leave off your nonsense and come here, here—both. [Takes both by the hand and leads them towards each other. Val. What would you have? Mar. What are you doing, pray? Dor. I'm making peace, and ending this affair. (to Valère.) Pray are you mad, good sir, to squabble so? Val. You heard her kindly counsels, I suppose. Dor. (to Mariane.) Are you mad too, to lose your temper thus? Mar. Did you not see how he behaved to me. Dor. Folly on both sides. (to Valère.) Mark, her only wish Is to be yours—that I myself can vouch. (to Mariane.) He loves you only, and his sole desire Is to become your husband, that I'll swear. Mar. (to Valère.) How came you then to give me such advice? Val. How could you ask for it on such a point? Dor. You're both stark mad; come, give me both your hands. You first. (to Valère.) Val. (gives it.) What would you have with it? Dor. (to Mariane.) Now yours. Mar. Whither can all this tend? (gives hand to Dorine.) Dor. Come forward—quick. You love each other more than you suppose. [Mariane and Valère remain for some time holding each other by the hand, without looking at each other.] Val. (turning to Mariane.) Still, do not act as though you were compell'd, But look as though you did not hate me quite. [Mariane turns towards him smiling. Dor. Lovers are crazy, that's the honest truth. Val. (to Mariane.) I had, you'll own, good reason to complain; And, to speak plainly, was it not too bad To wound my feelings with such cruel words? Mar. But are you not the most ungrateful man? Dor. Leave this discussion for another time, And think how you'll prevent this wretched match. Mar. Yes—tell us all the means we must employ. Dor. Listen. First, put your father off his guard By feigning a consent to this fine scheme; Then 'twill be easy in extremities By some pretext to put this marriage off; In gaining time you're gaining everything. A sudden illness well will serve your turn— An ugly dream—a broken looking-glass,— At all events 'twill be the wisest plan Not to be seen talking together thus. (to Valère.) So go, and do your best among your friends To make them take your part about the promise; We'll rouse the brother to exert himself, And gain the step-mother for an ally. Good bye! Val. Whatever efforts we may make, Be sure my only hope depends on you. Mar. I cannot answer for my father's will, Yet none shall e'er possess me but Valère. Val. You crown me with delight. Whate'er I do— Dor. These lovers never can leave off their prate. Begone, I say. Val. In fact— Dor. Oh, what a tongue. Come—you go this way, you go that. There—there. [Pushes off each by the shoulders in a different direction. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Same Scene. Enter Damis, C., and Dorine, L. Dam. May I be called the worst of sneaking knaves If any weight of power can hold me back— Any respect—from doing something rash. Dor. A little curb yourself, for goodness sake; Your father only talk'd about the scheme, And 'tis not always plans are carried out. Dam. I'll terminate this upstart's vile intrigues, And make him know a little of my mind. Dor. Now gently, gently—to your mother's care Leave both your father and this same Tartuffe. Upon the latter she has influence— He shows respect for everything she says; So much so, one might think his heart was touched. She means to sound him on this marriage scheme, Learn all his sentiments, and let him know What mischievous results he may occasion By giving any hope of such a plan; His servant told me he was coming down, So go, I pray, and let me wait him here. Dam. I would be present at the interview. Dor. No, they must be alone. Dam. I will not speak. Dor. Then you deceive yourself—I know your temper; You will be sure to spoil the whole affair. Dam. No—I'll look on, and keep my temper, too. Dor. You'll wear me out. He comes! conceal yourself! [Damis hides in closet, R. Enter Tartuffe, R. C. Tar. Lock up my hair-shirt with the greatest care, And pray that Heaven may illumine you. If any one should ask for me, just say I've gone to share my mite among the pris'ners. Dor. All affectation and hypocrisy! Tar. What would you? Dor. Only that— Tar. Stay, I entreat, Before you speak, just take this handkerchief. Dor. Why? Tar. Cover those white shoulders rather more, Such objects to the soul are perilous. At once! at once! or I must quit the spot. Dor. There's not the least occasion, sir, for that, I shall depart when I have said two words: My lady is about to come down stairs, And begs the favor of an interview. Tar. She's welcome to it. Dor. (aside) How I soften him— My life upon it, but my guess is right. Tar. Will she come soon? Dor. Methinks I hear her now. Yes—'tis herself, I leave you both together. [Exit L. Enter Elmire, L. Tar. May Heav'n accord you health of mind and body, And may it bless your days to that extent Which the most humble of its vot'ries wishes. Elm. I'm much obliged for such a pious pray'r; But take a chair, pray, and we'll talk at ease. Tar. (sitting.) From your late illness are you quite recovered? Elm. (sitting.) Yes, perfectly, it left me very soon. Tar. I cannot give that merit to my prayers, To think they brought such favor down from Heav'n; But this I say: I have not breath'd a prayer That had not your recov'ry for its aim. Elm. Methinks 'tis too much zeal on my account. Tar. A health so precious cannot be o'erpriz'd, To save that health, I would have giv'n my life. Elm. This is, indeed, true Christian charity; I owe you much for such excessive kindness. Tar. Indeed I do, far less than you deserve. Elm. I wish'd to speak in secret of a matter, And am rejoic'd that we are unobserved. Tar. And so am I,—it is great happiness, Madam, to find myself alone with you; For such a moment I have often pray'd, But have not gain'd the precious boon till now. Elm. I only wish to hear a few short words Which shall reveal the secrets of your heart. [Damis shows himself a little. Tar. And, madam, I desire no greater bliss Than to lay bare my soul before your eyes; And to assure you, that when I have spoken Against the visits which your charms attract, My zeal has never been arous'd by hate, But by a transport which allures me on— [She draws back a litle. Elm. A pure emotion. Good—I thought as much: It was the safety of my soul concern'd you. Tar. (Taking Elmire's hand.) Yes, madam, and my ardor is so great— Elm. You hurt my hand! Tar. 'Tis from excess of zeal, Never would I have hurt you by design; No, I would rather—rather— [Puts his hand on her knee. Elm. Sir, your hand! Tar. I touch'd your gown—the texture is most soft. Elm. True, true, but— [Drawing away her chair. Tar. (Advancing his chair, and admiring the lace on Elmire's dress.) Nay, 'tis really marvellous To see how art improves the gifts of nature. Elm. True, true—but now on business let us talk; They say my husband means to break his word, By giving you his daughter. Is it true? Tar. He did say something, but to speak the truth, It is not there I place my happiness. Elsewhere the fascinations I behold Of that high bliss which solely I desire. Elm. You mean, you feel no love for earthly things. Tar. My breast encloses not a heart of stone. Elm. I know, that Heav'n alone can claim your sighs, That nothing here can fetter your desire. Tar. The love that binds us to eternal beauty Blunts not our sense to that which earth bestows The mind may be allured most readily By the perfection of Heav'n's handiworks. In such as you, its beauties are reflected, And in yourself its wonders are display'd. In that fair face such beauty is reveal'd As ravishes the eye—transports the heart. Ne'er could I look on you, most perfect creature, Without a feeling in my raptur'd soul— Here was Heav'ns portrait painted by itself! At first I shudder'd, lest this secret flame Was only one of Satan's crafty wiles; And then my heart resolv'd to shun those eyes, Thinking you were a peril to my soul. But now I feel—thou most surpassing beauty!— That in my passion there is nought of guilt; And, therefore, to my heart I give free course. 'Tis bold in me—most bold, I must confess— To bring you thus an off'ring of my heart. Upon your goodness all my hopes depend, Upon my own poor feeble efforts—none. You are my hope, my blessing, my sole rest: On you alone hangs happiness or woe. To sum up all, I am, as you decide, Blest, if you wish it; if you wish, it curs'd. [Damis shows himself. Elm. A gallant declaration, I confess, And somewhat startling too, to speak the truth. Methinks you should have better arm'd your soul, And reason'd somewhat more on such a plan. One whom, like you, all reckon most devout— Tar. Devout I may be, still I am but man; And he who, looking on those heavenly charms, Feels his heart captured—does not stop to reason. Doubtless, in me, this language seems most strange; But, after all, I'm not an angel, madam, And if my bold avowal meets your blame, Your own enchantments you should blame no less. When first I saw those superhuman charms, My soul rever'd you as its sovereign. The matchless softness of each heavenly glance, Broke through each obstacle my heart had rais'd, Surmounted ev'rything—pray'rs, fastings, tears, And fixed my wishes upon you alone. My eyes, my sighs, have often told as much— Now to reveal myself I use my voice. If with some little kindness you would look Upon the pains of your unworthy slave, Consoling me in your excess of goodness, And to my poor condition stooping down, Then—wondrous beauty—I would worship you [Kneels and lakes her hand; Elmire rises. With rapture such as never yet was seen. Your honor, mark, can run no risk with me, Can suffer no disgrace on my account. The courtly fops, whom women so admire, Are ever prompt to boast of what they do; Their reckless tongues betraying all who trust them, Sully the idol which their heart adores. Now such as we burn with a prudent flame— With us there is no doubt of secrecy, The care which we must take of our renown Is the best guarantee to those we love. When you accept our hearts at once you gain Love without scandal, joy without alarm. Elm. (drawing her hand away.) I listen, and I own your eloquence Addresses me in language plain enough. Do you not fear that I may be inclined To tell my husband of this gallant mood; That when he is acquainted with your flame His friendship for you may receive a check? Tar. I know that you have too much kindness, madam; That you will pardon my temerity; That, knowing human nature is but weak, You will excuse the transports of my love, Though they offend; that you will recollect Eyes are not blind to beauty—flesh is frail. Elm. Others, perhaps, might take a diff'rent course, But I shall show my prudence in this matter; My husband shall know nothing; in return, I have a favor, sir, to beg of you. I wish that you would zealously promote The union of Valère with Mariane, Abandoning this most unrighteous power Which builds your gain upon another's loss, And— Dam. (rushing from closet.) Madam, no,—all, all, shall be reveal'd. Here was I hidden, not a word I've missed, Sure Providence has brought me to the spot To crush the traitor who has wrong'd me so. To show me how to take a sure revenge, On his hypocrisy and insolence,— To lay before a cheated father's eyes, The villain's soul, who dares to talk of love. Elm. No, let his future conduct make amends, Let him deserve my pardon—that's enough. I've promised—do not make me break my word; Besides a noisy scandal I detest; A wife can laugh at folly such as this, And need not importune a husband's ears. Dam. You have your reasons for behaving thus, And I have mine for taking my own course; Every attempt to shield him is absurd. With this eternal show of bigotry, My indignation he has brav'd too much, And caused too much disorder in this house; My father he has govern'd far too long, Marring my love, while injuring Valère. But now, at last, the wretch shall be exposed. Elm. Damis— Dam. No, thank you—leave me to myself, My heart is at the summit of delight; Talk as you will I cannot be induc'd To give up all the lux'ry of revenge; Be well assur'd I'll see the matter out, And lo! here comes the opportunity. [Enter Orgon, C., and shakes hands with Tartuffe. Father, we've got, to gladden your return, A new and most surprising incident— For all your kindness you are well repaid. This gentleman has just display'd his zeal, He aims at your dishonour—that is all; I caught him here, sir, making to your wife A scandalous avowal of his love. So passing mild and prudent is her soul That she would hide this infamous affair; But I—I cannot screen the shameless wretch, And think that silence is a wrong to you. Elm. I hold that with such vain discourse as this A husband's mind should never be disturb'd; That honor is not serv'd in such a fashion; But 'tis enough, if we ourselves can guard it. This is my view. (to Damis) You would have held your peace If I had had the slightest weight with you. [Exit, L. Org. Good Heav'ns! can I believe what I have heard? Tar. Yes, brother, I'm a wicked, guilty, wretch; A most unhappy sinner cramm'd with evil— The greatest criminal that e'er was born, Sullied in ev'ry moment of my life Which is but one long course of mire and crime. Heav'n, I see, plainly for my punishment, To mortify me takes occasion now. Whate'er the crime of which I am accus'd, I have not pride enough to make reply. Give faith to all he says. Yea, arm your wrath, And drive me from you as a criminal, I should not then be put to so much shame As equals the full measure of my guilt! Org. (to his son.) What, traitor! by your falsehood would you dare To tarnish a pure virtue such as this? Dam. What! The feign'd meekness of this hypocrite Can make you give the lie to— Org. Silence, wretch! Tar. No, let him speak—you blame him wrongfully— You would do better in believing him. Why show me so much kindness in this case? Know you of what I may be capable? No, no—you are deceiv'd by empty show, I am not such as I appear to be; The world regards me as an honest man, But, in good truth, I am a worthless wretch. (crosses to Damis.) Yes, my beloved son, say what you will— Call me a villain, thief, or murderer And if you can find more detested names, I do not contradict; I merit all, And on my knees would suffer this disgrace As just repayment for a life of sin. [Kneels. Org. (to Tartuffe.) No, 'tis too much. (crosses to Damis.) Traitor! What! still your heart is hard, Dam. That you can be misguided thus! Org. Be silent, reprobate. Dear brother, rise. (to Damis.) Wretch! Dam. He can— Org. Silence! Dam. I shall choke with rage Org. Another word, sir, and I'll knock you down. Tar. For mercy's sake restrain your temper, sir; Rather would I endure the heaviest pain Than see a hair upon his head disturb'd. Org. (to Damis.) Ungrateful boy. Tar. Nay, hear him. On both knees I beg you will forgive him. Org. (falls likewise on his knees.) Cease, pray cease. (to Damis.) Behold his goodness, villain. Dam. Then— Org. Peace! Dam. I— Org. Silence! I know the cause of this attack— You hate him, all of you; but, mark me well, The more you try to drive him from this house, The more I am resolv'd to hold him fast; I'll give him, yes, at once, my daughter's hand, To crush the pride of all my family. Dam. You would compel her to receive his hand? Org. Yes, and this evening, too. To stir your wrath I'll brave you all, and make you clearly know That I am master here—must be obey'd. So now, sir, please retract your calumnies, And ask your pardon at the good man's feet. Dam. I—at the feet of that designing knave! Org. So, you refuse, sir, and insult him, too; Oh for a stick—(to Tartuffe)—nay do not hold my hand. (to Damis.) Now, at this very instant, quit my house, And never dare to show your face again. Dam. Yes, I will go, but— Org. Quit the house, I say; You've nothing, rascal, to expect from me Beyond my curse, and that— Dam. Hold, father, hold— Nought have I ever said or done to merit That heaviest of blows—a parent's curse. To you, I've always shown respect and love, And if my anger carried me too far, Zeal for your honour was the prompting cause. Farewell, sir, time may show the difference Between the seeming friend and outcast son. [Exit, C. Org. That he should thus insult a holy man— Tar. Heav'n pardon him the pain he makes me feel! If you but knew how much it wounds my heart, When they attempt to set your mind against me. Org. Alas! Tar. The thought of such ingratitude Gives the most cruel torture to my soul; The horror that I feel,—my heart's so full I cannot speak—I think that I shall die. Org. (weeping.) I wish that I had knock'd the rascal down. Console yourself, dear friend. Come, weep no more. Tar. We'll put an end to all these sad disputes; I see what trouble I occasion here, And feel convinc'd that I must quit the house. Org. You are not serious? Tar. Yes, they hate me so, And try to make you doubtful of my faith. Org. What then? I close my heart to all they say. Tar. They'll persecute me still, I do not doubt, And though you will not listen to them now Perhaps you will believe another time. Org. No, never. Tar. Ah, dear brother; but a wife So easily can sway a husband's heart. Org. No, no. Tar. I'll go at once, for when I'm gone, All cause for persecution is remov'd. Org. You shall stop here—my very life's at stake. Tar. I see that I must mortify myself, So be it, if you will. Org. Ah! Tar. That's enough, I plainly see what I must do henceforth; Honour is delicate, and as your friend, I'm bound all chance of scandal to prevent, I will avoid your wife, and you will find— Org. You shall keep close to her in spite of them. I am delighted to enrage the world, And wish that you were always seen together. E'en that is not enough; to brave them all I will not have another heir, but you. Now, at this instant, in good legal form, I'll make you a free gift of my estate— The cherish'd friend I make my son-in-law Is more than son, or wife, or relatives. The gift I proffer, will you not accept? Tar. The will of Heav'n be done in everything. Org. Poor soul! come, come, we'll draw the deed at once. And make these envious creatures burst with spleen [They embrace twice. Exeunt, C END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Same Scene. Enter Cléante and Tartuffe, L. C. Cle. The tale's in ev'ry mouth; and trust me, sir, You gain but ill-renown for this affair. I'm glad a moment has at length arrived In which I plainly can reveal my thoughts. I will not probe the story to its depths, I'll pass it over and assume the worst?— Assume that Damis' conduct has been base; That you have been most wrongfully accus'd. Granted all this,—is not a Christian bound To pardon injuries?—to shun revenge? Ought you to suffer that, on your account, A son is banished from his father's house? Once more I tell you, tell you candidly, Gentle and simple, all are shock'd alike. Trust me, you'd better set the matter straight, And not attempt to carry things too far. Yield up to heav'n all feelings of revenge, And reconcile the father with the son. Tar. Alas, with all my heart I wish I could; I harbour, sir, no sense of bitterness, I pardon all, yea, from my very soul,— But I must quit the house if he returns. After his conduct, which indeed was base, No intercourse between us could exist. None: else I should be slander'd grievously; Mere policy my kindness would be call'd, And all would say, that, conscious of my guilt, I feign'd a pious zeal for my accuser,— That in my heart I fear'd him, and had bought His silence by a show of charity. Cle. Your reasons, sir, are somewhat too far fetched. Are we oblig'd to punish guilty men? Remember, heav'n exhorts us to forgive: And, when you thus obey its high command, Lightly esteem the censure of the world. Tar. My heart, as I have said, sir, pardons him, And thus I follow the command of heav'n. But after the affront I have received, It orders not that I should live with him. Cle. But does it order you to take a gift; A gift, I say, most wrongfully bestowed? Tar. Oh, those who know me, sir, will never think That any love of gain has prompted me: Most valuless to me is this world's wealth, Its meretricious lustre charms me not. If I consent to take the father's gift It is—to speak the truth—because I fear That so much wealth may fall to wicked hands, And be employed for sinful purposes; While I, endow'd with such abundant means, Would seek heav'n's glory and my neighbour's good. Cle. Pray suffer not such delicate alarm To make you injure the sole, rightful heir. Let him, without a pang for conscience sake, Possess his own at his own proper risk. 'Twere better he should misemploy his wealth Than you should be suspected of a wrong. And since you feel you cannot live with Damis, Would it not be the better, wiser course,— The honest course, for you to quit this house, Than thus to let your friend expel his son Without pretext? Tar. Good sir, 'tis half past three, A pious duty summons me up-stairs. And you will pardon me for leaving you. [Exit. Cle. The knave! Enter Mariane, Elmire, and Dorine, L. Dor. Exert yourself in her behalf, Pray do, dear sir; for she is sick at heart. Her father says the contract must be made To-night, and this has driv'n her to despair. He's coming. Let us join our efforts all, Endeavoring by stratagem or force To thwart this most unfortunate design. Enter Orgon, L. C. Org. I'm glad to find you all assembled here. The marriage contract, which I bring with me, Contains a clause which will amuse you much. Mar. (crosses to Orgon, and falls on her knees.) For Heav'n's sake, father! Heav'n well knows my grief.— For pity's sake, if that can move your heart, Remit a little of a father's right, And do not claim obedience such as this. No—do not force me by this cruelty To hate the duty Heav'n would have me pay; Make not the life you gave a life of woe. If, in despite of all my youthful hopes, He whom I love must never be my husband, Still, still, this favour on my knees I beg, Unite me not to one that I abhor. Org. (aside.) Be firm, my heart, no weakness must you show. Mar. 'Tis not your love for him that pains my heart; Make that shine forth—bestow on him your wealth, And if 'tis not enough, give mine besides— You have my full consent; but spare myself. Let me within a convent's gloomy walls Pass the sad days which Heav'n is pleased to give. Org. A convent! Yes—I like this piety, Which only comes to thwart a father's will. Get up, girl! This repugnance of your heart Will but increase the merit of your marriage. 'Tis wholesome thus to mortify the tastes; So just obey, and trouble me no more. Dor. But then, sir— Org. Silence! to your equals speak. [Dorine crosses round to Mariane, L. Cle. If I may be allow'd to give advice— Org. Brother, your counsels are most excellent— They're well digested—I esteem them much— But, as you'll find, I shall not follow them. [Cleante crosses round to L. table. Elm. With what I see I am confounded quite; [Crosses to Orgon. Your blindness seems to me miraculous; 'Tis pure infatuation—nothing else— To close your eyes to what occurred to-day. Org. Your humble servant; but I know too well That you desire to help my scapegrace son, And will not contradict his calumnies. You were too calm by far to be believed, Virtue is not so quiet when attack'd. Elm. What! just because a passion is declared, Is honour bound to take up arms at once? Is it unable to repel assaults, Save with injurious words and flashing eyes? I only look with scorn on such a mode, And hate a tumult above everything. I am not one of those ferocious prudes Whose honour is array'd with claws and teeth: Preserve me Heav'n from virtue of the sort! [Crosses to L. Org. That's quite enough—I see the whole affair. Elm. Absurd! This weakness is most marvellous. And pray, would you retain your unbelief, If your own eyes disclosed to you the truth? Org. If my own eyes— Elm. Yes. Org. Stuff! Elm. Nay—just suppose That I could show you all as clear as day. Org. Nonsense! Elm. Oh, what a man! Still answer me— I do not ask you to believe my words, I only say, suppose that you were hid Where you could plainly hear and plainly see, What would you say of this same pious man? Org. What should I say? Why, nothing, nothing else. It cannot be. Elm. This has gone on too long; I see I must not trust to mine own lips, But you must be the witness of the truth. Org. Agreed—agreed! Now we shall test your skill. Elm. (to Dorine.) Just send him here. Dor. He has a subtle wit, And may not be so easily entrapped. Elm. Nay, we are soon deceived by those we love, And self-love leads us to deceive ourselves. Just send him hither. [Exit Dorine, L. C. (To Cléante and Mariane.) You will please retire. Exeunt Cléante and Mariane, L. And you (to Orgon) will hide yourself beneath this table. Org. How? Elm. Yes—'tis absolutely requisite. Org. But why beneath this table? Elm. Grant me patience! I have a plan, and you shall judge of it: Hide there, I say, and when you're safely there, Mind that you're quite secure from eyes or ears. Org. So be it; I'm too docile, I must own, And I would see you through this strange affair. Goes under table. Em. Believe me, you will find that I am right, And mind—this matter is most delicate; Whate'er I say you must not take offence. I purpose, by the way of blandishment, To pluck the vizard from this crafty knave. When I encourage each unholy wish, And give full scope to his temerity, 'Tis only to confound him in your eyes: Mind too—when you are amply satisfied, You hasten to the rescue of your wife; You understand—keep silent—here he comes. Enter Tartuffe, L. C. Tar. (L.) 'Twas here, they said, you wish'd to speak with me. Elm. (R.) 'Twas true sir, I have secrets to reveal; But close the door, before I 'ope my lips. And look around, lest we may be surpris'd. [He shuts door and returns. Such an affair as that we had to day We cannot certainly desire again. It was indeed a terrible alarm. That Damis frighten'd me on your account; And you observ'd, no doubt, how much I strove To thwart his efforts, and to check his rage: To speak the truth—so much was I confounded, I never thought of contradicting him. But this, thank Heav'n, has all been for the best, And everything is in a better train; Your fame for piety has quell'd the storm. My husband cannot even feel annoy'd, But, braving all the scandal of the world, Insists that we should always be together. Therefore can I, quite fearless of reproach, Meet you alone, and therefore, can I, too Open—perhaps, too readily,—my heart. Tar. These words are somewhat hard to comprehend, So diff'rent, madam, was your style just now. Elm. I see my first refusal anger'd you— How little you can read a woman's heart! How little you can fathom what is meant When it so timidly defends itself! Mark you, however strong the power of love, We still must show reserve in owning it; Hence we defend ourselves; but by our manner Too surely you may know our hearts are lost— May know our lips ill represent our wishes, And such refusals promise—everything. I own that this confession is too frank, And argues little for my modesty, But since I've given free passage to my words Let me speak out. Should I have done so much To check Damis—should I have heard so long, So quietly, the offer of your heart, If such an offer filled me with disgust? Nay, when I urg'd you to give up all though Of this same marriage, could you not perceive A certain sentiment on your account Was prompting me—deep horror of a scheme To share a heart, which I would have entire. Tar. Madam, no doubt it is the greatest joy To hear such words drop from the lips we love; Their liquid honey glowing through my soul, Gives a delight it never knew before. To please you is my highest, dearest wish, In you my heart places its only hope: But still this doating heart would fain have leave To doubt a little such surpassing bliss. Your words might seem to me an honest fraud, Devis'd to bring the marriage scheme to nought; In short—in fact—to speak without disguise, I dare not trust those words, with all their sweetness, Unless some further favor proves their truth, And plants within this heart a steadfast faith In all the kindness you possess for me. Elm. (after coughing to warn her husband, who lifts the cloth,) Nay, nay, indeed you're too precipitate. Would you have ev'ry tenderness at once? I make a frank avowal of my—love, Too frank—and still you are not satisfied. Tar. The less we merit, less we dare to hope. Such happiness is promis'd by your words That till I reach it, I must doubt perforce. [she looks at him Yes, doubt, because 'tis rashness to believe That one who has deserts so small as mine Can gain so rich a prize. Believe I cannot, Till some reality confirms me, madam. Elm. Your love is really most tyrannical, And raises a strange trouble in my soul. How violently it can seize on hearts! It gives no quarter—grants no breathing time. 'Tis scarcely fair to take advantage thus Of any weakness one may show for you. Tar. If you receive with a benignant face My homage—why refuse a further proof? Elm. I fear that heav'n— Tar. No, no, dispel that fear, Believe me, howsoever great the sin I'll take the peril all upon myself. (She coughs.) Your cough is troublesome? Elm. 'Tis horrible. Tar. Perhaps this little bit of liqorice—(she coughs) Elm. No, 'tis a cough that will defy all cure, You need not waste (coughs) your liqorice. (coughs) Tar. Alas! 'Tis very bad. But to resume our theme: Your scruples may be easily remov'd. Evil is only evil when 'tis known— The scandal of the world creates the sin; In fact, a secret sin is none at all—(she coughs). Now, in my case, you're sure of secrecy. Elm. I see, I see, resistance is in vain— Yes, only you can be responsible. Tar. Agreed! agreed! I'll answer. I alone. (They both rise.) Elm. Just open yonder door and ascertain My husband is not in the gallery. Tar. No need of so much care on his account; Madam, we both may lead him by the nose. Elm. No matter, leave the room a moment pray, And see that all's completely safe without. [Exit Tartuffe, C. Org. (rises.) A knave! a knave! I see, a wicked knave! I'm quite confounded—all must be a dream. Elm. So soon you quit your hiding-place? Absurd! Come back again, I pray—it is not time. Trust not conjecture, wait to see the end. Wait patiently. Org. He is the very devil. [Crosses to L. back. Elm. Condemn him not on flimsy evidence, Ere you decide be thoroughly convinced, And be not hasty, lest you may be wrong. [She hides him behind her. Enter Tartuffe. Tar. All, all conduces to my happiness. I've well observ'd the spot on ev'ry side, No soul is near us. My delighted heart! [As he advances she steps aside and discovers Orgon: Org. Nay, softly, softly, you are much too quick— Let not your passion carry you so far. An honest man—a very honest man— To woo the daughter and desire the wife! Long have I thought all was not as it looked— I thought that we should have a change of tone. Now I am satisfied—I seek no more. Elm. (to Tartuffe.) Against my will, sir, have I acted thus. Tar. You cannot, sir, believe— Org. (Crosses to Tartuffe.) No words, no words— But just say nothing, and just quit my house. Tar. My motive was— Org. This talk is idle now— I tell you, quit my house, and instantly. Tar. Change this proud language—quit the house yourself: The house is mine, and I shall prove it mine. I'll show how vain it is to have recourse To such poor stratagems to break with me; That those who beard me know not what they do— That I can still avenge the cause of heav'n, And bring to shame those who would drive me hence. [Exit. Elmire laughs. Elm. What can he mean by language such as this? Org. I am confounded—and I cannot laugh. Elm. How? Org. Oh, that deed! That fatal deed of gift. Elm. The deed of gift! Org. Yes, yes, the mischief's done. But there is something else disquiets me. Elm. Pray—what? Org. I'll tell you all—but first I'll see Whether a certain chest is still upstairs. Exeunt L. C. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Same Scene. Enter Orgon, followed by Cléante, L. C. Cle. Where are you going? Org. I can scarcely tell. Cle. It seems to me we should deliberate As to the course most proper to pursue. Org. That chest! that chest! That is the worst of all. Cle. Does it contain some weighty secret then? Org. Argas, my friend whom often I deplore, Confided it to me before his flight. Papers, he told me, are contained in it, On which depend his fortune and his life Cle. And you could trust it to another's care? Org. It was a case of conscience prompted me. I gave that traitor all my confidence, And he convinced me by his arguments The chest would be far better in his hands, For then, if any question should be ask'd I could most truly swear I had it not. Cle. Your case, I must confess, seems bad enough. The deed of gift—this story of the chest, Show, I must own, small prudence on your part. And now the man has such a hold on you, To thrust him forth is more imprudent still. Some milder plan, methinks, might be essay'd. Org. That such an evil soul, so false a heart, Could be concealed beneath so fair a show! And I, who took the knave into my house A beggar!—But I've done with pious folks; All signs of goodness I so much abhor, I'll be more wicked than the very devil. [Crosses to R. Cle. Restrain yourself, I pray, restrain yourself. Why, brother, can you ne'er be moderate? Your path is never that of common sense, You always go to opposite extremes. Now, in this instance, you have just found out You have been cheated by a show of zeal; But pray, are you compell'd on this account To fall into an error greater still And judge the heart of ev'ry honest man By that of one who proves to be a knave? Because a rascal has imposed on you By putting on a grave and specious mask, You fancy all are cast in the same mould, And that the world holds no true piety? Leave logic such as this to profligates; Distinguish goodness from the show of good. If you must err, whichever side you take, 'Tis best to err on that of charity. Enter Damis, L. C. Dam. What, father! Does the rascal threaten you? Is all your goodness blotted from his mind, Or rather, made a weapon of assault? Org. Yes, yes, my son, such is the wretched fact. Dam. Nay, leave the knave to me, I'll crop his ears. We must not flinch in such a cause as this. Nothing more easy than to set all right; I'll brain the villain, and—behold 'tis done. Cle. (crosses to C.) Exactly—yes, a very young man's speech; You'll just be pleas'd to moderate this tone. We live, it happens, in a state of things Where little good is done by violence. Enter Madam Pernelle, Elmire, Mariane, and Dorine, L. C. Mad. P. What is all this? They tell me horrid news. Org. Nay, nothing more than what these eyes have seen. For all my kindness I am well repaid. I find a man in deepest misery, I lodge him as a brother in my house, Each day brings with it some new benefit. My wealth I give him, and my daughter's hand, And all this time the graceless, thankless knave Harbours a black design against my wife! Not even this contents his villany; The benefits which I have heap'd on him— Heap'd on him in my blind and foolish zeal, He uses now against me for my ruin; Would bring me to that state of beggary From which I have reliev'd him. Dor. (mimicking.) The poor soul! Mad. P. My son! I can't believe he is so base! Org. You can't believe? Mad. P. The good are always envied Org. Mother, what can you mean by talking thus? Mad. P. Here they all lead a sorry sort of life, And so regard him with an eye of hate. Org. But, madam, what has hate to do with facts? I speak of facts. Mad. P. Oft' when you were a child I taught you how this world detested goodness The envious—they may die, but envy not. Org. This touches not to-day's discoveries. Mad. P. They've forged, no doubt, a thousand tales against him. Org. I tell you I have seen it all myself. Mad. P. There is such malice in the sland'rous tongue Org. You'll drive me mad. How often must I sa I saw this bus'ness with my own—own eyes. Mad. P. Such tongues will ever scatter poison, sure; And none against such foes can guard themselves. Org. Mother, with all respect, you're talking stuff; I've seen him—I—I tell you—I—I—I— Yes, seen—seen—seen—Must I for ever, madam, Keep bawling out the truth into your ears? [Sits in chair at table, R.] Mad. P. Appearances too often will deceive; We must not always judge by what we see. Org. I trust— Mad. P. Too prone is nature to suspect, And good is oft interpreted as ill. Org. (starts up.) Then, when a rascal would seduce my wife, I'm bound to call it Christian charity! Mad. P. Without just grounds you never should accuse, But always wait till you are certain, quite. Org. Why how can I have greater certainty; Am I to wait till, here—before my eyes— He—goodness, Madam! what shall I say next? Mad. P. His soul was too replete with piety, And nothing ever shall convince my mind He was so bent on evil as they say. Org. You are my mother, else I do not know What I might say, so much am I enrag'd. Dor. Aye, you are rightly paid in your own coin— You would trust none, and now, Sir, none trust you. Cle. Psha! we are wasting in mere idleness The time that we might usefully employ; The rascal threatens, and we must not sleep; With a most potent weapon is he arm'd, And so we must not anger him too much. Org. True, very true; but what is to be done? I was so gall'd I could not check my rage Cle. I wish from all my heart 'twere possible To bring about some show of peace between you. Elm. If I had known he was so strongly arm'd I would have shunn'd this danger. Org. (looking off.) Who is that? Truly, I'm well prepared for visitors; See what he wants. (to Dorini.) Enter M. Loyel, L. C. M. Loy. Good day, my pretty one. With yonder gentleman I wish to speak. Dor. I fear he is too busily engaged. M. Loy. Nay, I'm the very last man to intrude; About my business there is nought unpleasant— 'Tis more agreeable than otherwise. Dor. What is your name? M. Loy. No matter; only say Monsieur Tartuffe sends me to take possession. Dor. (to Orgon.) A gentleman, a pink of courtesy, Whom Monsieur Tartuffe sends upon a matter That's more agreeable than otherwise. Cle. (to Orgon.) See who the man can be, and what he wants. Org. Perhaps he comes to make a compromise; What sort of feeling ought I to display? Cle. All bursts of anger carefully avoid, And listen if he hints at any terms. M. Loy. Good day, Sir, may you e'er be prosperous, And ill to them who harbour ill for you! Org. (to Cléante.) This mild beginning but confirms my view; Most surely it foreshows a compromise. M. Loy. I always have esteemed your family. Org. Sir, with the deepest shame I must confess I do not even know your honor'd name. M. Loy. My name is Loyel—I'm by birth a Norman; By calling, I'm an Usher of the Rod, And have—may Heaven be prais'd—for forty years Practis'd my office, with fair credit too. And now I come, with your good leave, dear sir, To execute a certain trifling order. Org. What! you are here— M. Loy. Pray, sir, content yourself; It is an order merely to eject You and your family, your goods and chattels, And just make room for others to come in. Org. What!—leave my house? M. Loy. Yes, if you please, good sir; To Monsieur Tartuffe now belongs this house— Indisputably, with your whole estate, By virtue of a contract which I hold,— A contract rightly drawn and binding fast. Dam. This impudence is most unbearable! M. Loy. Excuse me, sir, I've nought to do with you, But only with this gentleman; and he— I'm certain—knows his duty far too well To stop the course of justice. Org. Aye, but— M. Loy. True; Not for the world, I'm sure, would you resist; But you'll permit me,—as indeed you're bound,— To execute the duties of my calling. Dam. I tell you what, my Usher of the Rod, A stick may chance to dust that gown of yours. Loy. Pray, bid your son be silent or retire, I should not like to see him in a scrape. Good honest folks I hold in great esteem, And only took this charge upon myself For fear some other not so delicate Might manage things in a much ruder fashion. Or. Who, in the name of patience, can do worse Than turn one out of doors? Lo. We give you time; I will suspend proceedings till to-morrow. I merely shall remain here for the night With—say ten followers—quite quietly; And just for form's sake, ere you go to bed, You'll give me up the keys, sir, of the house; Nought shall disturb your rest, believe me, sir, But when to-morrow comes, to-morrow morning, You'll kindly clear the place of ev'ry stick. My men will aid you, they are passing strong— Chosen, I beg to add, on that account— I treat you tenderly, as you perceive, And so I hope to find no obstacle. Org. (aside.) The half of what is left me, I would give To send my fist into that villain's face With all my weight of anger. Cle. Calm yourself. Dam. I feel a wondrous itching in my hand. Dor. Good Master Usher, you've a fine broad back, Just made, methinks, to lay a stick across. Loy. My pretty one, such words are dangerous: Not only men, but women may be punish'd When they resist the law. Cle. A truce to this, Give us at once the paper and retire. [Gives money to Loyel. Loy. Farewell, may heav'n shed blessings on you all. [Exit, L. C. Org. May you, and he who sent you both be— Cle. Hush! Org. Well, mother, am I right. This fine exploit Will serve you as a sample for the rest. Mad. P. I'm petrified, I've fallen from the clouds. Dor. (mimicking) Indeed, you're wrong to blame him, very wrong, This conduct only proves his piety; He knows that worldly wealth corrupts the soul, And therefore, out of charity, resolves To rid you of a foe so dangerous. Org. You always will be talking, hold your tongue. [Crosses to R. C. Enter Valère, L. C. Val. 'Tis with regret, sir, that I trouble you, But pressing danger prompts me to this step. A friend, who knows the interest I take In you and yours, has dared to violate The secrecy which state-affairs demand. He tells me nought but flight, immediate flight, Can save you from the peril that awaits you. The villain who has cheated you so long, Has even now denounc'd you to the throne; And, to confirm his charge, brings forth a chest Belonging to a culprit 'gainst the State, Which you, he says, have guarded secretly, Neglecting thus your duty as a subject. A warrant now is out against your person, And he himself attends the officer. Cle. These are the weapons which the villain wields To dispossess you. Org. Scoundrel! base! most base! Val. Delay, however short, is dangerous; My carriage stands already at your door, And here's my purse fill'd for your present wants. Nay, more, I'll travel as your convoy, sir, And see you to your journey's end. Org. Alas! How much am I indebted to this kindness! Some day, I hope, I shall repay you, sir, For this great service, and I pray meanwhile That heav'n may make you prosper. Farewell, all! Enter Tartuffe with an Officer, C. Tar. Stop, stop, good sir, you need not run so fast, 'Tis no great distance to your journey's end; You are arrested in the prince's name. Or. This for the final blow you have reserved. [Rushing to Tartuffe, but is stopped. With this you would destroy me utterly, Worthily ending your perfidious work— Tar. Insult me as you will, you wound me not— I can bear anything for conscience sake. Cle. A mighty case of patience, I must own. Dam. Mark how the knave abuses honest words. Tar. Nor am I mov'd by any bursts of rage— I seek to do my duty, nothing more. Org. Have you forgotten, villain, how this hand Reliev'd you from most abject misery? Tar. No—well I know what aid I have receiv'd, But duty to my prince I place so high, That gratitude is nought when weigh'd against it. My prince! for him I'd freely sacrifice Friend—wife—relation—and my worthless self Elm. Impostor! Dor. With what cunning he contrives To throw a specious cloak o'er all he does! Cle. But if your zeal is such an honest zeal, And urges you to such extremities, How is it that it did not show itself. Before my brother fathom'd your design Against his wife, and drove you from his house? Tar. (to Officer.) Free me, I beg, sir, from this empty talk, And execute your charge without delay. Off. I stand corrected—I have been too slow, And willingly I act upon your hint; So follow me to prison, sir, at once. (To Tartuffe. Tar. I? I, sir? Off. You. Tar. But why imprison me? Off. 'Tis not to you I shall explain myself; (to Orgon.) But you, I beg, sir, to dispel all fear. Happily, we are govern'd by a prince Whose eyes can penetrate all knavish acts; At once he saw the baseness of this man, Who, powerless, before his searching gaze Betray'd himself whilst plotting against you. He stands discovered as a well-known cheat, Who long has practised in another name, And perpetrated villanies enough To fill thick volumes. The result is this: The deed of gift by which he claims your wealth Our monarch cancels—(all exclaim “Ah!”)—pardoning as well Your fault against the state; for he remembers How oft you have been zealous in his cause. Dor. May Heaven be prais'd! Mad. P. At last, at last, I breathe. Elm. Most happy issue— Mar. And beyond all hope. [As Tartuffe is led off by Officers, Orgon is rushing after him. Org. Now, rascal, now! Cle. (detaining him.) Nay—stop, good brother, stop. Do not insult the fallen—leave the wretch To his own fate, and hope that e'en to-day His heart may be reform'd. Org. Right—always right; Another is more worthy our regard. Uniting thus my daughter and Valère [Joins hands. Let me reward a pure and honest love. CURTAIN FALLS.</field>
