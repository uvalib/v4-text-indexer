      <field name="fulltext">As the Overture commences the Curtain rises and discovers— Scene First. —A well-known exterior, i.e., the portrait of the Great Mogul, as seen on the cover of a new pack of cards. At the conclusion of the Overture a crash is heard, and the scene parting, as if torn asunder, discovers—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. —The Court Card Room of the King of Spades. The King and Queen of Spades are seated on their thrones—His Honour the Ace on the right of the King, and his Grace the Deuce on the left of the Queen—The rest of the suit are arranged on each side of the throne, and captive Hearts, of both sexes, kneeling before it, under the guard of the Knave of Spades—Grand flourish—At a sign from the King the Deuce advances to the orchestra. Deuce. (pointing with his wand to the leader) It's your lead—play! Glee and Chorus—“The mighty Conqueror of Hearts.” The mighty Conqueror of Hearts in triumph here behold! With all his trumps, we sound his fame, our champion stout and bold! While honours count for victory, ye Spades, in chorus sing, “A lucky job it was for us we turned up such a King!” K. of S. Thanks, my brave Pips! my noble black cards, thanks! We like this adulation! Praise is nought Unless 'tis laid on with a trowel! We Are king “de jure” and “de facto.” Therefore, Play the whole game or nothing! Q. of S. Yet, my liege— (rising) K. of S. Silence! Q. of S. I'm dumb. (sits down) K. of S. Not you, sweet partner; to the court I spoke. Proceed, and without further interruption. Q. of S. Well, then, my liege, I was about to say (rising again) I thought— K. of S. We differ from you totally, And so sit down. My lords! court cards and common, You have just now, and justly, sung our praises. We scorn to laud ourselves; but we are sworn To speak the truth. We are the greatest monarch Upon the cards. Be quiet; for we know it. In evil hour for him, the King of Hearts Affronted us. On the green cloth of battle Soon hand to hand we met. But our hand proved Too strong for his—a pretty hand he made on't— For with our own great spade to bed we put him, And left him playing dummy. Deuce. Glorious game! These red men thought to make us blackies slaves. You taught them, Sire, a trick worth two of that— K. of S. Silence! we would we could induce the Deuce To hold his tongue—deuce take him! As we said, The King of Hearts is playing dummy. But Not so his captive Queen—she talks of liberty, And talks incessantly, as queens, and women, Captive or not, are but too prone to do. Has she a motive for so talking? Silence— We thank your forwardness, but we can answer, Good people, for ourself. Has she a motive? We have a shrewd suspicion—we say nothing— The King of Diamonds is a widower; The Queen of Hearts good-looking—we had almost said Confoundedly good-looking—we say nothing. Deuce. (aside) Methinks his Majesty talks much for one Who constantly says nothing. K. of S. Silence! I say 'tis just upon the cards That this same King may offer her his hand— Should he prefer his suit— (flourish without) Did we say trumpet? (Knave of Spades retires and returns with a card) Kn. of S. My liege, a card. K. of S. The Ten of Diamonds! Kn. of S. The Cardinal, lord great Cassino to And envoy from his Majesty his king. K. of S. Aha! my Pips! I ask you, is your Sovereign A good hand at a guess or not? No answer! Turn up the Ten of Diamonds. Enter Ten of Diamonds. K. of S. Welcome, Lord Cardinal! What says our cousin, His precious Majesty of Diamonds? Ten. Diamonds sends health to Spades, and greets him thus: The Queen of Hearts—poor heart—a captive maid, Or rather made a captive by thine arms, Here languishes in prison. K. of S. Wonderful! Hast thou no news, my lord? All this we know, We took that trick ourself! Deuce. 'Twas an odd trick. K. of S. Aha! Deuce. Because it won the game. K. of S. Oho! Proceed. Ten. Her Majesty of Hearts— K. of S. Silence! Ten. Alack! how can I tell my tale, Great Spade, and yet be silent too? K. of S. That's true— But cut thy tale short, and let's have the heads. Proceed from “languishes in prison,”—we Have heard the rest before. Ten. In prison, and The King, my king, desires her instant freedom. K. of S. Desires! Ten. Entreats! K. of S. That's better. We'll consult His Honour here, the Ace. Lord Chancellor, You hear the King of Diamonds doth propose To take the Queen of Hearts, and in exchange To give us—nothing. The advantage thus, Being all upon one side, 'twere crooked policy Methinks, to grant this boon. But how say you? Ace. I doubt—I'll take the papers home and look at them Ere I give judgment in this card case. K. of S. Pshaw! Doubt me no doubts! Chief Justice Hoyle hath ruled, When in doubt win the trick. We do refuse— Ten. My answer is then? K. of S. Flat denial; unless He offer every diamond in the pack By way of ransom! Go, inform our cousin We'll see him—he knows what first. For yourself, Your stick is in your hand, sir—cut it. Ten. Ah! this to me! Remember, haughty Spade, Pope Joan is our near kinswoman! There's but One pip between us and her Holiness! Beware of excommunication! There's A bull— K. of S. A bull! we'll take it by the horns. The Pope! Poh, poh! Thou canst not, Cardinal, in all the cards Find one so slight and so ridiculous To charge me with an answer as the Pope. Go tell her so. She'll find that in her game The King of Spades' a stop. Despising too You and our master—thus we turn our back— You'll find your answer plain! (King and Court turn their backs upon the Cardinal) Break up the court— (Exit Cardinal) We're for the chase. Go order Hunt and Son The principal makers of playing-cards, the De la Rues of that day. To let our pack out. Whosoe'er the game, Be sure you follow suit! Air and Chorus—“Der Freischutz”—“Hark! follow; hark!” King. Away, hie away to the table's green cover; Ourself will be pony and make up the pack; The hounds shall play points, and when land games are over, There's fish in the pool, and we'll turn up a Jack. Let Jew money-lenders play “Beggar my neighbour;” Let merchants play “Commerce,” and soldiers “Picquet;” At vain “Speculation” philosophers labour; We're for “Whist”—and our crown on the rubber we'll bet. Chorus —Then, Cards, follow suit, follow suit, follow suit, &amp;c. (Exeunt Omnes)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Three. —A Room in the Palace. Enter the Knave of Hearts. Kn. of H. So far my game goes well. The King of Hearts Is slain—his suit dispersed—his Queen a captive; All, all through me! 'Twas I finessed the Tyrant, I overlooked his hand, and told the foe Exactly what he held. O, sweet revenge! What! For I ate a paltry score of tarts Made on a summer day by his fair Queen, Must I be scorned, discarded, rhymes made on me And set to filthy tunes? Forbid it, fate! No, no; I'll not be called a knave for nothing. Vengeance is fed crop-full; but Love! ah, Love! Almighty Love is yet unsatisfied. I'm sore perplexed. The Queen of Spades' blue eyes Have driven the black ones of the Queen of Hearts Almost from out my nob; I must win both. Intrigue and Matrimony! By Pope Joan! The Knave—the poor despised Knave—will be Within an ace of clearing all the board. Air—Knave of Hearts—“The Minstrel Boy.” The King of Spades to the chase has gone, In the midst of the pack you'll find him; He leads his suit to the black game on, But his Queen he has left behind him: An honour she is called to his throne, And she bears like a saint her slavery; But, like the rest of her sex, I own She doats on a bit of knavery. (Exit)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Four. —A Prison—The Queen of Hearts is discovered—attended by four of her Ladies, Maids of Honour, one of whom, kneeling, holds before her a miniature of the King, her late husband (a playing card in case). Queen. (advancing to the air of “Portrait Charmant”) Yes, thou sweet image of my sainted lord, By day I hold thee ever in my hand: Night comes, and finds thee laid out in my crib! Well I remember, I was sweet fifteen, And you were fifteen too; ah, what a pair! Made for each other; when your first fond suit Brought a wild flush into my maiden cheeks, Which counted, made you out. For years I wore thee “Here, in my heart of hearts.” For years we pegged At the same board together. Oh! my husband, Now thou hast shuffled off thy mortal coil, I have no heart to cut for partners more! Enter the Knave of Hearts. Ha! Can I trust my sight? Avaunt base knave— Ruffian—rascallion—rebel—regicide— Thief—coward—jackanapes—and jack-a-dandy. In short, thou everything but gentleman. Kn. of H. In short! That's personal; marry come up, Shorts are the fashion; and Bob Short Rules for the game of whist were published under this pseudonym, well known and constantly quoted at that time. I am now asked, “Who was Bob Short?” is called A high authority! “In short,” forsooth! Short-sighted lady, I'll be short with you. I love you, and would take you for my bride. Q. of H. Take me! You take the Queen! You cannot do it. I am a cut above you, sir, and sooner Than I'd take you, and make myself the Jill of such a Jack, I'd take the meanest spade, and dig my grave with it. Kn. of H. Indignant Queen— Q. of H. Impudent knave! talkest thou of love to me? Kn. of H. Alack, madame! Air—Knave—“Is there a heart?” Is there a heart that never loved? If so, it is not mine: Is there a knave can mark unmoved A point that should be thine? Oh! bear him to some distant shores, Or shabby “silver hell,” Where monsters only play “All Fours,” Where honours never tell. Q. of H. Honours! I never reckoned upon thine, be sure. Kn. of H. Hear me in prose my ardent passion tell. Q. of H. Thy passion! thine! begone, or thou shalt find Thy passion, saucy knave, a joke to mine! Kn. of H. Madam, I go. How's this? (aside) The King of Spades. So, so; fair Queen, you are his game to-day; To mark the King, I'll play at écarté. (conceals himself) Enter the King of Spades. K. of S. How fares our fairest prisoner of war? Q. of H. With the humility which best befits Our sad condition, briefly we reply, We're none the better, sir, for seeing you. K. of S. Most captivating captive, we in turn Do wear your chains; so we have cut the pack, And slipped away to pay our duty here: See at thy feet a spade— (kneeling) Q. of H. A rake you mean. K. of S. Well, be it so; thou art the mould of form! And I propose— Q. of H. And I refuse— K. of S. Hard heart! Before thou knowest what. Q. of H. I know what's what, and therefore do refuse. Air—Queen—“My heart with love is beating.” When spades our hearts were beating, And doubling them all down, I felt it was by cheating My husband lost a crown. Fair play could ne'er have done it, For, when our colour fled, E'en you yourself must own it, The run was on the red. K. of S. Never! Beware the sequence; you have ruffed me When leading from my weakest suit; but now I'll change it, Queen, and play a forward game! (seizing her) Q. of H. I'll call a card. Help! help! Knave of Hearts, who has slipped out, returns with the Queen of Spades. K. of S. The Knave of Hearts! my wife too! I've misdealt, And lost the game by it. Q. of S. So, sir, I've caught you. What! fling down your own hand, and take up Miss Before my face! K. of S. It was amiss, I own; but I repent, And ask my partner, “can you one”—forgive? Q. of S. Your partner scorns to answer; you have scored A point that honours do not count at. K. of S. Nay, That's nine, you know, and we are but at sixes And sevens; all may yet be well. Q. of S. Away! K. of S. Slight of hand! I'll not bear this! Spades are still trumps, and I of Spades am King, And the last player too; the trick is mine: So, madam, as you choose to say we're nine, I'm out by cards. What, ho! there! take 'em up: I'll make a brulé of 'em all! The Ghost of the King of Hearts appears. K. of S. (starting) Mother-o'-pearl! What carte-blanche have we here? Ghost. I am the ombre of the King of Hearts. Q. of H. My husband! Kn. of H. My late King! K. of S. Avaunt and quit my sight—let the earth hide thee! There is no speculation in those eyes That thou dost glare withal! Ghost. I do not play At speculation. Kn. of H. (aside) No; he plays at fright. K. of S. What game is now a-foot? Ghost. Whist! whist! oh whist! K. of S. Whence comest thou? Ghost. From a—hem! A Pandemonium—a shocking place At the court-end of the town. K. of S. And what thine errand? Ghost. I have come to warn you; You have revoked— K. of S. Poh, poh! Ghost. I say you have. A heart was led; and when you trumped this trick My Queen was in your hand. K. of S. I care not. I—I'll not give up a point. Ghost. Then D. I. O. Q. of H. Oh! say before you go Two words of comfort to your wretched wife. Ghost. Red wins. (the Ghost disappears) Q. of H. Ah, tyrant! hearest thou that? red wins! K. of S. Red wins! red shall not win—that ghost shall lie In the Red Sea!—What, ho! My guards here! Without there! Concerted Piece—“Piano Pianissimo,” from the “Barber of Seville.” Knave of Hearts, Queen of Hearts, and Queen of Spades. Piano Pianissimo:—Keep within bounds. For such high airs you have no grounds. All But King. Of the sequence pray take heed, sir, Such vile play can ne'er succeed, sir! Fate will soon return your lead, sir— Conscience won't be mute!— And you'll rue the day, indeed, sir, You refused your partner's suit! King. Silence! Silence! Cease your bawling; By the heels I'll lay you sprawling; For a new deal Vengeance calling Makes me deaf to Pity's suit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Five. —Exterior of Card Castle—March in “Blue Beard.”—Enter King of Clubs and Pam. K. of C. Behold the King of Clubs! who has become An errant knight for the sweet Queen of Hearts; And Pam, an arrant knave, who leads him on With idle hopes unlimited, in lieu Of dealing reason out with friendly hand. Pam. To deal out reason to a lover is To lose a deal of time. Odd's fish and counters! I've served too many knights at the round table Not to know that, my master! K. of C. Pam, be civil, And tell me if thou seest a card house near That may contain my love. Pam. Your most majestic Majesty of Clubs Has but to follow your own nose three steps, And you may ring it soundly at the gate Of a fair castle. K. of C. Ha! my grief's so great It blinds me! As thou sayest, there is a castle— And built with cards! my sympathetic soul Tells me that here my love in limbo lies. E'en while her husband lived, across the board Oft have her black eyes on my blue beard cast Their whistful glances. Ha! I know the play Will fetch her out. From Blue-Beard I will pull The finest air. Come forth, my dulcet lute, And you, my sharp set squire, a while be mute, While I, with lowly suit and plaintive ditty, Attempt to move this gentle heart to pity! Air—King of Clubs—“Twilight Glimmers,” &amp;c.—“Blue Beard.” Sky-light open, and play bo-peep, Lady-love—lady-love—never fear Wall to climb and ditch to leap, Lady-love—lady-love—see limbs here! The Queen of Hearts appears on the battlement. Q. of H. What airy sound floats o'er the area rails, And to the high top-garret of my tower Adds a new story built by hope and joy? I've heard that air before—I'll try this here. Air—Queen of Hearts—“Tink a tink,” “Blue Beard.” Here sighing, sick, dying, sorrow hanging over me, Faint, weary, sad, dreary, I in prison lie! My moaning, deep groaning, surely must discover me To some kind gentleman who may be passing by, Clink, clink a clink a clink; I clank my chains in madness: Tink, tink a tink a tink, and in despair I sing; Wink, wink a wink a wink; I cannot sleep for sadness, Tink, tink a tink a tink; while thus my hands I wring. Together—Queen of Hearts. Tink, tink a tink tink; indeed I'm very melancholy; Tink, tink a tink tink; though thus I dance and sing. King of Clubs and Pam . Tink, tink a tink tink; indeed she's very melancholy. Tink, tink a tink tink; of her woes I've/he's touched the string. K. of C. That voice! Q. of H. And that! K. of C. 'Tis she! Q. of H. 'Tis he! K. of C. Yes. Q. of H. No. K. of C. It is! Q. of H. It cannot be! Hold still, my heart! It is the King of Clubs; I met him oft At the salon in Paris. He had then Just reached his natural vingt-un. Ah me! K. of C. She speaks! Ah, speak again; and “by the card Equivocation would undo us!” say, Canst thou, and wilt thou, fly with me alone? Or must I make a general to-do, And with a conquering Pam-flush sweep the board? Q. of H. Alack, I'm limited to these sad walls, And you can't play so high. K. of C. I'll play the deuce But I will win thee!—Is there not a cavern Beneath this tower? Q. of H. I don't exactly know, But rather am inclined to think there is. K. of C. Enough! At eight to-night I'll through it lead Some chosen hearts, and force the King of Spades To give thee freedom! That I swear to do, Or “go up one life” in the great attempt. Q. of H. That's what I call a trump. Propitious fate! Good day, good knight; and mind you call at eight. K. of C. Oh, sink your doubts, nor to your sighs give way. I'll cater for your good, and ne'er betray. Air—King—“Had I a heart,” &amp;c. The Knave of Hearts, for falsehood framed, Alone could injure you; Believe me, I should feel ashamed To cheat a Queen so true. Go, lady, to St. James'-street, At White's or Brookes' ring, A friend in ev'ry Club you'll meet, A lover in their King! Q. of H. I'll doubt no more; till eight, dear love, adieu, And I'll believe thee, like thy beard, true-blue. (Exit Queen) K. of C. (to Pam) Go, summon up my stoutest clubs to handle These spades as they deserve, and let the hearts That have escaped the fray come bounding now Around the standard of their injured Queen. Enter Clubs and Hearts, with standards, &amp;c. Air—King of Clubs—“Scots wha ha'e.” Hearts that have for freedom bled, Clubs that I have often led, Welcome suits both black and red, Up for victory! Now's the time, and now's the hour, See of spades the sable show'r, Playing “Brag,” while in their power Tricks and knavery. Who would spare a traitor knave? Who would call on Pope to save? Lest a spade should dig his grave, Let him cut and flee: Who for Hearts' fair Queen and Pam, Caring not for spades a d—n Will lose the rub or win the slam! Let him on with me! (Exit King of Clubs) Pam. Cards!—Face!—Shuffle and Cut! (Exeunt)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Six. —Interior of Prison, as before. The Queen of Hearts discovered. Q. of H. Was ever card so kept upon the rack As I am? How long must I here remain To play at Patience by myself? Alack! The King of Clubs! Where sticks he by the way? Sure time has grown club-footed, it doth limp So tardily along. He said he'd call At eight; and see, the turret clock is just About to score it. Strike, O clock! strike hard; Knock down the spades by which I'm double guarded, And lead up to the Queen. Air—Queen—“Gavotte de Vestris.” “I can't get out.” (I quote the words of Yorick's starling.) “I can't get out,” So Sterne-ly here I sing. King of Spades is cruel, Keeps me without fuel, Gives me water gruel: Kill him in a duel, King of Clubs, do—there's a jewel. “I can't get out.” Strike, strike, O clock; As yet you've only struck three quarters; Strike, strike, O clock; One more will make a WHOLE. Soon that King, provoking, His nose here'll be poking, If I cry out “Woah! King,” He'll pretend I'm joking. To protect me now I've no King. Strike, strike, O clock. (1st verse repeated) (To the slow part) Unless he his promise breaks, He'll come in a brace of skakes. (Clock strikes to “Haydn's” (and the Queen's) “surprise”—Flourish without—The wall of the Prison is knocked in—Enter the King of Clubs. Q. of H. Methought I heard a noise. K. of C. (advancing) If you did not, Sweetheart, you must be very deaf indeed. Q. of H. What do I see? Ah, liberty; I'm out! K. of C. You shall be by a hole. The enemy Give in at my first show. The King and Queen Of Spades are prisoners. Clubs are trumps this round, And Hearts shall be the next! What news with you? (To Pam, who enters hastily) Pam. My liege, the Knave of Hearts defies your Majesty To single combat and at single stick. K. of C. We do accept his challenge. Tell the Knave We'll beat him out of doors! Duo—Queen of Hearts and King of Clubs—From “Tancredi.” Clubs shall the trump be! The scamp O, shall decamp O, Off he shall tramp O—While laughter roars. Be not afraid O! I've quelled the spade O. I'm not. He's quelled the spade O. And soon this rebel I'll/he'll beat out o'doors. The saucy knave, he Shall cry peccavi! And on his marrow bones play at all fours. He! He! Shall on his marrow bones play at all fours. (Exeunt)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Seven. —The Court Yard of the Palace—Grand March from “Faust.”—Entree of Clubs, Hearts, &amp;c., with the King and Queen of Spades, and others of their suite, prisoners; Pam, the Queen and Knave of Hearts. Kn. of H. What says the oracle? We sent to ask Which party should prevail. Pam. Sir Knave, the oracle Has answered, “Cherry colour.” Kn. of H. Cherry colour! Victoria! That's our own! I do remember The Ghost did also say that red should win! I'll take the Ghost's word for a thousand pounds. Courage, my heart! Trump out! (trumpet sounds) Again! again! (trumpet is answered) Enter the King of Clubs. K. of C. Of one or both of us the time is come. Kn. of H. With all my heart; but 'tis your suit will fail; I bear a charmed life! The oracle Has said that cherry colour shall prevail. K. of C. Despair thy charm! And let the demon thou so long hast served Tell thee, false knave, that there are cherries black As well as cherries red! Kn. of H. Accursed be the tongue that tells me so, And ditto ditto to the juggling fiends That keep the word of promise to our ear, And break it to our hope. Lay on, great Club! K. of C. My crown and sceptre both upon the rub. (flourish—they fight) K. of C. (hitting him on the head) One for his nob! (trips him up) Two for his heels! Kn. of H. I'm low! K. of C. I'm high! Kn. of H. I'm Jack! K. of C. And I the game! Laugh and lay down your cares, fair Queen of Hearts, The pool is yours! Q. of H. It looks a rich one!—Have you all put in? And are you all content that I should win? I dressed the board in trembling and in fear, For even Pope might fail to save me here. Mine is a ticklish game of speculation, And I but play to gain your approbation. Oh! on this point pray let it be decided: I trust your honours will not be divided. Come, let me see your hands—I hope you're strong In hearts for me, and mean to hold them long. Ye, who subscribe to all the clubs in town, Will scarce club up to put my poor club down: Ye, who have left your counters for my shop, Say, will ye make the Queen of Hearts a stop? Don't put out hastily a pair of Bards, But deal with them and me for “Playing Cards.” (to the Orchestra) Our new Olympic Game, thus safe from ill, We'll draw for partners and have one quadrille, The Beaten Knave shall on the fiddle play, And call the figure which we cut to-day. The Ace of Spades produces a violin and bow from his Chancellor's bag, and hands them to the Knave of Hearts. Kn. of H. (mounting a seat) “En place!” Hart's New Set! The King of Clubs leads out the Queen of Hearts—the King of Spades, his own royal partner—the Knave of Spades, a Maid of Honour—and Pam, the Deuce. Quadrille. Kn. of H. (calling the figures in the following order:) “Matrimony,”—“Intrigue,”—“Pam Seul,”— “Pool,”—“Game.” (and the curtain falls on a general shuffle by the whole pack) CURTAIN.</field>
