      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATORY SONNET. TO ROBERT SOUTHEY, ESQ. POET-LAUREATE, And Honorary Member of the Royal Spanish Academy. To none of all the friends with whom kind heaven Has blest my lot, more, Southey, than to thee Can I ascribe the wish t'excite in me A trust, that somewhat to my soul was given Of power, which with due culture might have thriven. My youthful feelings, vowed to poesy, In thee a sponsor found who willingly Didst promise that for which I had but striven. Imperfect token of entire esteem, A branch dissever'd from its parent root, Now I present to thee: and may'st thou deem That the plant bears in this its foreign shoot, Withdrawn from Italy's more fervent beam, In Britain, undeteriorated fruit. CHARLES LLOYD. Brathay, 13th October, 1814.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Philip. Carlos. Gomez. Perez. Leonardo. Isabella. Counsellors. Guards.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SceneâThe Palace of Madrid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Isa. Love, apprehension, and flagitious hope, My breast forsake. I, Philip's faithless wife, Dare I behold with fondness Philip's son? Yet who beholds that son, and loves him not? A heart, though bold, humane; a lofty nature; An intellect sublime; and, in a form Most fair, a soul of correspondent worth. Ah, why did Heaven and Nature make thee such? Alas! why rave I thus? Do I intend, By meditating thus on his perfections, To tear his image from the deep recesses Of my adoring heart? Oh, if a flame So fatal in its consequences, were By living man discover'd! Oh, if he Suspected it! He sees me ever sad ... 'Tis true, most sad; yet evermore avoiding The fascination of his thrilling presence. And from Spain's austere palace well he knows All joy is banish'd. Who can read my heart? Oh that with other mortals I could vie In ignorance! that, as I can deceive, And shun the curious world, I could deceive, And shun my own corroding consciousness. Wretch that I am ... My only solace left Are tears; and mine, alas, are tears of guilt. But, that with less of risk I may indulge My wretchedness, to some interior chamber Let me retire in time ... Ah, who is this? Carlos? ... Ah, let me fly! My every look, My every word, might now betray me. Hence With speed. SCENE THE SECOND. Carlos, Isabella. Car. Oh sight! what ails thee, queen, that thus Thou shun'st my presence? Dost thou thus avoid A wretch by wrongs oppress'd? Isa. Prince ... Car. Well I know My father's court is leagued against my safety. That I, displeasing to my sire and king, Should read impress'd on every countenance, Enmity, malice, envy ill-concealed, Excites no wonder. But I scarce believe That thou, not harden'd by fell cruelty, Thou, who beneath a more auspicious sky Than this, wert born; thou, not as yet corrupted By this infected atmosphere, concealest, Beneath that soothing, yet majestic mien, A bosom inaccessible to pity. Isa. Within these thresholds what a life I lead Too well thou know'st. The manners, new to me, Of a pride-harden'd court, have not yet driven The partial fondness for one's native soil, That universal instinct, from my breast. Thy pangs I know, the insults undeserved That thou endurest; know and pity them. Car. Thou pityest them? Oh, sweetest consolation! That kind assurance sheds on all my cares Benign forgetfulness. And with thy griefs I sympathize; and thoughts of thy distress Oft banish my own torments from my heart. Tears for thy cruel lot I often shed, And fain ... Isa. A lot more easy to endure, I hope in time to gain. My ills with thine Are not to be compared; then yield them not A pity so intense. Car. Does pity thus From me offend, when thine to me is life? Isa. Thou prizest at a rate extravagant That powerless pity. Car. Ah! Extravagant ... What say'st thou? Tell me what emotion then Excels or equals that soft beat of pity, Thrilling the pulses of each noble heart; Which, of itself, suffices to avenge The wrongs of fortune; and no longer leaves That heart unblest, whose comprehensive love Embraces every where the cause of man. Isa. What say'st thou? Yes, I pity thee.âOh, Heaven! I feel not towards thee as a step-dame feels. And if I dared for the unoffending son Plead to the offended father, in thy cause My prayers should soon be heard. Car. Who dare do this? And further if thou durst 'twould misbecome thee. Oh, hard necessity! Thou art the cause, Innocent as thou art, of all my woes; Yet I conjure thee in my favour ... Isa. I The cause of all thy anguish? ... Car. Yes, my anguish May to that fatal day be all referr'd, That day accursed that gave, and took thee from me. Isa. Ah! what dost thou recall? Too transient was That hope. Car. The best part of myself, in me That hope grew with my life, nursed by my sire, That sire who will'd so solemn an engagement Unnaturally to dissolve. Isa. Alas! ... Car. At once Subject, and son, of monarch absolute, I groan'd in agony, but held my peace; I wept, but wept in secret. To my will His will was law supreme. He was thy husband, And from my uncomplaining passiveness, Who but myself can sum up what I suffer'd! From such an effort of transcendent virtue, (Virtue it was, and passing human strength) My heart was steep'd in pride and bitterness. On duty's stern, inexorable law, Mine eyes were ever fix'd. If e'en in thought Nature was frail, I call to witness Heaven, Who knows our inmost impulses. In tears The day, in tears the tedious night I spent, And what avail'd it? In my father's bosom Hatred increased, as in my bosom grief. Isa. Believe the assurance, that thy father's heart, Though tainted with suspicion, hates thee not. Perhaps in thy father's breast the train of courtiers Have sown suspicion, who, from thy contempt, The more they feel its justice more detest thee. Car. Ah! thou art ignorant of my father's nature, And may kind heaven that ignorance prolong! The treacherous intrigues of an impious court To thee are all unknown. An upright heart Could not believe, much less such guilt imagine. More cruel than the sycophantic train Surrounding him, 'tis Philip that abhors me. He sets the example to the servile crowd; His wrathful temper chafes at nature's ties; Yet do not I forget that he's my father. If, for one day I could forget that tie, And rouse the slumbers of my smother'd wrongs, Never, oh never, should he hear me mourn My ravish'd honours, my offended fame, His unexampled and unnatural hate; No, of a wrong more deep I would upbraid him, He took my all the day he tore thee from me. Isa. Prince, dost thou then so little call to mind That he's thy father, and thy king?â Car. I pray thee Pardon the involuntary turbulence Of a nigh-bursting heart. I never found Before this moment the convenient time To tell thee all my sorrows. Isa. Nor should'st thou Have told them now, nor should I listen to them. Car. Stay. Since in part thou hast heard my wretchedness, Hear what remains. I am constrain'd to say ... Isa. Peace. Quit my presence. Car. Princess, I obey. I will refrain from words, but oh, how much Remains to utter! My last hope ... Isa. What hope, That is not criminal, canst thou now cherish? Car. Hope that thou dost not hate me. Isa. 'Tis my duty; Thou must confess it, if thou dare to love me. Car. Then give me proof of hatred, and thyself Be my accuser to thy spouse and king. Isa. Shall I, before that king, pronounce thy name? Car. Yes; if thou deem me guilty. Isa. Is thy guilt Unshared? Car. In secret then perchance ... Isa. Alas! What have I said? or thou hast understood, Or I have utter'd, more than duty warrants. Think, I conjure thee, on thyself and me, Thou, in persisting, I, in hearing thee, Merit the king's revenge. Car. Ah, if in heart Thou wert inflamed, and pined'st as I pine, And if thou saw'st a thousand times a day The adored object in another's arms,â To track the footsteps of thy ravish'd love; To satisfy thine eyes; sometimes to seek, As now I seek, an innocent relief From a few accents, to thy breaking heart; Thou would'st esteem a venial indulgence. Isa. Ah, shun my presence. While I pine in life, 'Twill be but for a little time, forsake These fatal walls. Car. Oh, heavens! and could I thus Absent myself? My frustrated attempt Would swell my list of crimes; and, as it is, With crimes enow my father charges me. The only one of which I am culpable, He knows it not. Isa. Ah, that I knew it not! Car. If that offend thee, thou wilt have thy vengeance, And that too, quickly. Let me linger here ... If to the grave my anguish bring me not, The hatred of my sire will drag me there: Who, in his heart of blood, has long resolved My death. Within these horrible abodes, Yet, since they shelter thee, dear to my soul, Ah, suffer me, a victim in thy sight, To breathe my latest sigh! Isa. Ah, sight of woe! While thou stay'st here I fear too much thy fate. A voice announces thy sad destiny To my foreboding heart. At once receive The first and latest pledge of luckless love. Fly, I conjure thee, if thou love me truly, From cruel Philip.â Car. 'Tis impossible. Isa. Then fly my presence more than ever now, And keep at once thy fame untouched, and mine. Oh, clear thyself of the invented fault Of which thou art charged by jealous envy. Liveâ 'Tis I command thee, live! With thee my thoughts, With thee my heart in spite of all my struggles, With thee my soul will go. Lose e'en the trace Of my sad steps, nor let me hear thee more, No, never. Heaven only knows our fault. Let us conceal it from the world, conceal it E'en from ourselves: and from thy bosom rend The rooted recollection ... if thou canst. Car. Wilt thou then no more hear me? never more? SCENE THE THIRD. Carlos. Car. Oh wretched me! oh, moment of distraction! And dost thou leave me thus? Oh cruel lot! Sorrow and joy assail me in extremes. SCENE THE FOURTH. Carlos, Perez. Per. At last I have found thee, Prince ... but heavens! whence springs Such agitation? what disturbs thee thus? Thy transport seems to baffle reason's power. My ready sympathy awaits thy grief. Ah, speak! thou answerest not! from earliest years Have I not grown thy comrade at thy side? Hast thou not call'd me friend? Car. Within these walls Dar'st thou to such a word give utterance? A word that's banish'd in its real meaning From impious courts, though often there pronounced. Useless to me, and fatal to thyself, Henceforth will be thy truth. Oh imitate The fickle crowd, and to the sovereign idol Present, with it, a profitable incense. Per. Ah, do not thus degrade me: from that crowd Sever me in thy judgment; yet what boots it To swear affiance here? where all men swear it, And all are perjured. To more certain proof Bring both my hand and heart. Point out the danger That I may brave for thee. Where is the foe That most offends thee? Speak ... Car. No enemy Have I except my father. I disdain To grace his parasites with such a name. With silence his, their hate with scorn, I meet. Per. The king knows not the truth: hence he is inflamed Towards thee with wrath unjust; and artfully Others that wrath foment. In manly tones I will assert it for thee. Car. What sayest thou? More than thou thinkest, Philip knows the truth; He hates it rather than is ignorant of it. But in my favour he hears no one speak. Per. He must perforce the voice of nature hear. Car. He has a heart less flexible than steel. Leave to my innocence my best defence, And to divine protection, which sometimes Deigns to shed on me a benign regard. If I were guilty, I would not disdain As intercessor thee, and thee alone: What greater proof of friendship can I give thee? Per. Permit me then to share, whate'er it be, Thy destinyâthis, and no more, I ask. In this flagitious court what other track, That honour's voice forbids not to pursue? Car. Perchance thou art ignorant that my destiny, Whate'er it be, can ne'er be fortunate. Per. I am thy friend, and not the friend of fortune. If it be true that grief, when shared, is lessened, A persevering friend, thou shalt possess Me, by thy side, in all adversity. Car. My heart conceals a grief that ends in death, A lofty grief, that yet is precious to me. Why cannot I to thee reveal my thoughts? Ah, no! I do not seek, nor could I find, A more disinterested friend than thou: Yet by disburthening my oppressed heart, I cannot give thee a sure pledge of friendship. Depart: What can result to thee from faith So generous, and so lucklessly affianced? I am not worthy of so rich a tribute. Once more I bid thee quit me. Knowest thou not 'Tis an atrocious fault to fix thy love On one towards whom his king directs his hate? Per But knowest thou not, in spite of every king, What glory 'tis that friendship to preserve? Thou piercest, but thou changest not my heart, With doubting thus my faith. A mortal grief, A grief thou mayest not speak, weighs on thy breast. I do not wish to know it. But if I Wish, yea implore, that, with thy life, my life May fall a victim to that grief, canst thou Fiercely reject that brotherhood in woe? Car. Well, as thou wilt. Here is my plighted hand, Disastrous pledge of a disastrous friendship. Thee I compassionate: but shall not bewail Henceforth my fate; nor providence upbraid, So bounteous to me in so rare a friend.â Philip, how much am I more blest than thou! Thou, 'midst vain pomp and treacherous adulation, Object of pity rather than of envy, Hast never known the blessedness of friendship.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Philip, Gomez. Phi. What, above all things that this world can give, Dost thou hold dear? Gom. Thy favour. Phi. By what means Dost hope to keep it? Gom. By the means that gain'd it: Obedience and silence. Phi. Thou art called This day to practise both. Gom. 'Tis no new function: Thou knowest that I ... Phi. I know that thou hast been, Among the faithful, still most faithful found. But on this day, on which my mind revolves Affairs of import high, perchance my lips Will utterance give to plans so new and vast, That, as a prologue to my after-speech, It seemed to me expedient to recall, In a few words, thy duties to thy mind. Gom. Then may the mighty Philip, on this day, More thoroughly than he has ever done, Bring to the test my truth. Phi. The task is light That I enjoinâand light alone to thee: Never, no never, to another man. The queen forthwith is coming. Thou wilt hear me Converse with her at length. Meanwhile do thou Watch the minutest workings of her countenance. Fasten on her the inquisitorial look, That look with which thou art skilful to unravel The unspoken inmost inclinations Of thy king's inmost heart, ere silently Thou bodiest them in action. SCENE THE SECOND. Philip, Isabella, Gomez. Isa. My lord, I come, obedient to thy will. Phi. Queen, thou art summon'd in a mighty cause. Isa. Ah! wherefore ... Phi. Quickly shalt thou hear it, queen. Can I expect it from thee? Yet why doubt? Who can with more sincerity impart Than thou, impartial counsel to my breast? Isa. Counsel, my lord, from me? Phi. Than that of others, More I esteem thy judgment. Hitherto If thou hast never shared with me the toils Of government, thou shouldest not ascribe it To the defective fondness of thy husband, Nor to thy king's defective confidence, But to my fond anxiety to screen thee From toils of state too weighty for thy sex. But, to my sorrow, I behold the day On which a question of debate arises, Where ties of blood with schemes of policy Are so confounded, that, by nature, thou Art designated my prime counsellor. But first I feel inclined to hear from thee, Whether thou judgest of most sanctity, Most to be dreaded, most to be revered, The name of Father, or the name of King?â Isa. They are held by all of equal sanctity. Who knows not this? Phi. He who most ought to know it. But tell me also, ere the fact I state, And tell without reserve, dost love, or hate, Carlos my son? Isa. My lord? ... Phi. I understand thee. If thou didst yield to thy first impulses, And not obey the stern behests of duty, Thou wouldst behold him ... as a step-dame. Isa. No. Thou art deceived ... The Prince ... Phi. Is dear then to thee. Yet hast thou so much of true honour left, That being Philip's wife, that Philip's son Thou lov'st with ... love maternal. Isa. Thou alone Art law to all my thoughts. Thou lovest him ... At least I deem so ... and e'en so I love him. Phi. Since thy well-regulated, noble heart, Beholds not Carlos with a step-dame's thought, Nor with blind instinct of maternal fondness, I chuse thee for that Carlos as a judge. Isa. Me? ... Phi. Thou hast heard it. Carlos the first object Was many many years of all my hope, Till, having turned his footsteps from the path Of virtue, he that lofty hope betray'd. How many pleas did I, from time to time, Invent to excuse my disobedient son? But now his insane, impious hardihood, Hath reached its greatest height; and I am compell'd, Compell'd against my will, to means of violence. To his past crimes such turpitude he adds, Such, that, compared with this, all others vanish; Such, that words fail me to express his baseness. With outrage so immense he hath assail'd me As all comparison to baffle; such, That, from a son, no father could expect it; Such, that no longer I account him son. Ah! thou e'en shudderest ere thou knowest its vastness! Hear it, and shudder in another fashion. More than five years thou knowest a wretched crew On swampy soil, and shores whelm'd by the ocean, Have dared my sovereign mandate to resist; Rebels no less to God than to their king. They find in iterated crimes defence. Thou knowest with what expense of blood and treasure This realm hath borne this sacrilegious war. I would not suffer that rebellious crew To go unpunished, with mock majesty To triumph in their crimes, though perseverance In such a cause cost both my throne and life. To immolate the impious generation As victims of my wrath, I swear to Heaven. And death perchance may be a benefit To those who spurn at all authority. Now, who from me would credit the assurance That with such dire, and such ferocious foes, I am compell'd to enumerate my son, Alas! my own, my only son? Isa. The prince? ... Phi. The prince! yes, many intercepted letters, Clandestine messages, seditious words Pronounced incautiously, of this dire fact Too certainly convince me! I conjure thee To picture to thy mind my agonies, A sire betray'd, a circumvented king! And to pronounce what lot by justice falls From me, his sire, on such an impious son? Isa. Oh, God! Thou will'st that I pronounce his fate? Phi. Yes, thou of that art arbitress supreme. Fear not the monarch, flatter not the father: Pronounce. Isa. I fear alone offended justice. Before the throne's imposing solitude, By artifice iniquitous, the cause Of guilt and innocence is oft confounded. Phi. Canst thou then doubt of what thy king affirms? Who more than I can wish him innocent? Ah, would to Heaven the impeachment were unfounded. Isa. By clearest evidence he stands convicted? Phi. Who can convict him? Turbulent and head-strong, He scorns to bring against the clearest proofs Some palliative pretexts, much less reasons. I would not, of this latest misdemeanour, With him hold conference, till I had calm'd The first emotions of my just resentment. But though my rage be mute, stern policy Moves me to speak. Alas! the voice of father, That agonizing voice, resounds within me. Isa. Ah, hear that voice! no voice can equal it! Perhaps he is less a culprit than thou thinkest; Indeed his guilt on this emergency Seems too impossible to challenge credence. Hear him thyself, whatever be his crimes: Who than a son, between a son and father, Can be a mediator more persuasive? Granted that he be haughty with a train Not friendly to the truth, assuredly Thy presence will subdue his pride. To him Open thine ears, and harden not thy heart To the soft influence of paternal love. Him to thy presence never dost thou summon, Never speak to him. He approaches thee Impress'd with fear; and love and confidence Are scared by thy inflexible reserve. Revive within him, if it be suppressed, His native virtue; 'tis impossible That, in thy son, it can be quite extinguished. To no one else trust thy paternal cares; Present to him the aspect of a father, Reserve a monarch's majesty for others. What, from a generous heart, may not be gain'd By generous treatment? If he be convicted Of some delinquency (and who is perfect?) To him alone do thou alone display Thy just resentment. There is affection in a father's wrath; What son can witness it, and tremble not? One accent that paternal fondness dictates, Would, in that noble breast, remorse more deep Excite, and less of rancour, than ten thousand Malignantly, and artfully pronounced, To drive him on to desperation, By treacherous, seeming friends. Let thy court hear That thou dost highly prize, and love, thy son; That thou accountest his impetuous youth Worthy of pardon, though not free from blame; And thou wilt hear, with one consenting voice, Thy universal court resound his praise. Suspicions not thine own tear from thy heart; And leave base apprehensions of foul treason To monarchs who deserve to be betray'd. Phi. This action, worthy of thyself, is thine Alone; to make the cry of nature reach A father's heart: ah, others act not thus! Oh wretched lot of kings, they cannot utter, Tremble to utter, much less dare obey, Nature's benign affections. How I rave! Even dare they make mention of them? no: They are compell'd, by interest of state, To stifle and dissemble utterly All natural impulses. The time is come When in my breast they shall find free admission. Thy intercession, more than perhaps thou dreamest, Hath torn the veil from every mystery. Almost I am compell'd to deem him guiltless, Since thou dost think him so. Without delay Bring the prince hither, Gomez. SCENE THE THIRD. Philip, Isabella. Phi. Thou now shalt see that to the guilty prince I can appear, more than is fit, a father; If I must ever be compell'd to meet him In all the terrors of a king offended.â Isa. I do not doubt thy promise. But he comes: Suffer me to depart. Phi. StayâI command thee. Isa. I have ventured to express my thoughts to thee Since thou wouldst have it so. Why tarry longer? The presence of a step-dame, when a son Meets an offended father, were intrusive. Phi. Intrusive? No. Thou much deceivest thyself, Thou art a necessary witness. Thou hast alone a step-dame's name. For once From thy remembrance banish e'en the name. Thy presence will be grateful to my son. Ah, see, he comes: and he shall not be ignorant That, of thy own accord, thou hast pledged thyself As surety, for his virtue, faith, and love. SCENE THE FOURTH. Philip, Isabella, Carlos, Gomez. Phi. Approach me, prince. Now tell me when will dawn That day in which, with the fond name of son, Thy father may accost thee. Thou should'st see, (Ah, would'st thou have it so) blended at once The name of father and of king; ah, why, Since thou lov'st not the one, fear'st not the other? Car. My lord, though these unmerited reproaches, Ere now, have often jarred upon my ears, They always sound most harsh and unprovoked. Silence from thee seems not so wonderful; Guilty I am, if in thy sight I seem so. 'Tis true my heart assents not to the charge, Free from conviction and remorse it glows, But not the less profound regret it feels That thou esteem'st me guilty.â Oh, could I trace the source of my misfortunes, Or, if the phrase seem more appropriate, Know the true origin of my offences! Phi. Thy love so lukewarm towards thy native country; And towards thy father thy ... no love at all; Thy guilty intercourse with crafty flatterers ... Enquire no further why thou dost offend me. Car. I am pleased, at least, that thou hast not ascribed This to a nature innately perverse. I may make some amends for what is past; Learn with what fondness I should love my father, And how to love my country; learn the means To banish grovelling flatterers from my presence, Who, in proportion as the father's power That of the son's transcends, the father's ears With lies more pertinaciously assault. Phi. Thou art still a youth. Thy heart, thy look, thy actions, Too plainly tell that much beyond discretion Thou trustest to thyself. This I should deem Only a venial error of thy age, If I did not with disappointment witness, That, as thy years advance, thy judgment seems, Instead of perfecting, more immature. I shall account thy error of to-day A youthful indiscretion, though, alas! It bears the marks of veteran turpitude. Car. Error? ... but what? Phi. And thou dost ask it of me? And art thou not aware that all thy thoughts, Much more thy daring deeds, thy thoughts most secret, To me are all reveal'd? Queen, thou beholdest; 'Tis not to be, but not to feel himself Worthy of blame, that constitutes his guilt. Car. Father, at last from doubt deliver me: What have I done? Phi. So manifold thy crimes, That doubt of which shall prompt my just reproach, Serves thee instead of innocence. Now hear me. Say, hast thou not had commerce with that soil Where most the furnace of sedition blazes? E'en in my palace, did'st thou not perchance, Before the dawn of day, clandestinely, A trait'rous and protracted audience give To the orator of the Batavian rebels? To that base miscreant who comes begging pity, If you believe his words, but who, in heart, Perfidious machinations cherishes, And projects of rebellion unavenged. Car. Father, must my most unimportant actions Be all ascribed to guilt? 'Tis true, I spoke At length to the ambassador; 'tis true That I, with him, compassionate the fate Of those thy hapless subjects, and I dare Avow the same compassion in thy presence. Nor thou thyself would'st long withhold thy pity, Provided that, like me, thou hadst heard at length Of the iron government, in which, oppressed Beneath proud, avaricious, inexpert, Weak, cruel, yet unpunished ministers, So many years they have groan'd. For their misfortunes My heart with pity bleeds; I boldly own it: And say, would'st thou, that I, the son of Philip, Possessed a vulgar or a cruel heart? The hope perhaps was too presumptuous That I, with stating the unvarnished truth, Could wake, this day, thy bosom to compassion. But how can I be thought to offend a father In holding him accessible to pity? If thou on earth dost wish to represent The Ruler of the skies, what attribute Like that of mercy, fixes the resemblance? But, notwithstanding, of my punishment Thou art arbiter supreme, if I appear, Or am, on this occasion criminal. The only boon I dare to challenge of thee, Is to be spared th'unworthy name of traitor. Phi. A noble pride breathes in thy every word. Ill canst thou, nor should'st thou affect to do it, The lofty motives penetrate, or judge, That influence thy king. Hence thou should'st tame That turbulence undisciplined; that bold Impatient wish to give advice unasked; Thy judgments, as if fraught with mighty sense, Officiously to impart. Learn to be cautious, If on the mightiest of the thrones of Europe Thou art destined to be honour'd by the world. That indiscretion now in thee may please, Which then may cast upon thy character A stain of deep reproach. 'Tis time, I warn thee, T'assume a new deportment. Thou hast sought Pity from me, and pity shalt thou find; But for thyself: all are not worthy of it. Leave me to be sole judge of my own measures. Erewhile in thy behalf, and not in vain, The queen at length addressed me. Of my love, No less than of her own, she deems thee worthy ... To her, more than to me, thou owest thy pardon ... To her. From this day forward I expect That thou wilt better know both how to prize, And how deserve my favour.âNow behold, By thy solicitations I am won, Oh queen; and, urged by thee, consent to learn Not only to forgive, but love my son. Isa. My lord? Phi. To thee I owe it, and to thee Alone. For thee have I repressed my wrath, And in th'indulgent character of father Have I reproved my son. Of this day's mercy Mayest thou ne'er give me reason to repent. Oh, son! that thou mayest not defeat her hope, Strive to attach her more by thy deportment. That he may be progressive in amendment, Do thou, oh queen, more frequently permit him Thy presence to enjoy ... speak to him ... guide him ... And listen to her thou, and shun her not. I will that it be so. Car. Oh, how the sound Of pardon, when addressed to me, is irksome! But if I must accept it from my father, And, lady, thou obtain that pardon for me, May my fate grant (my fate my only crime) That I may never more endure the shame. Phi. Rather should'st thou take shame to have needed pardon, Than, needing, to have gain'd it from thy father. Let this for once suffice: weigh well my words. Do thou, oh queen, withdraw to thy apartments; Thou shalt, ere long, behold me there. Meanwhile I must bestow on other weighty cares A few brief moments. SCENE THE FIFTH. Philip, Gomez. Phi. Heard'st thou? Gom. I heard. Phi. Sawest thou? Gom. I saw. Phi. Oh, rage! Then the suspicion ... Gom. Now is certainty. Phi. And Philip yet is unrevenged? Gom. Reflect ... Phi. I have reflected. Follow thou my footsteps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Carlos, Isabella. Car. Pardon, oh pardon, my unwonted boldness, If at an uncouth and unusual hour I asked by thy Elvira a brief audience. I was impelled to this by urgent motives. Isa. What is thy wish? Why dost thou not resolve To leave me to myself? Why seek to lessen That peace I scarcely have! ... why came I here? Car. Be pacified. I leave thee instantly; Leave thee, and to my wonted tears return. Listen to me. Erewhile thou dared'st entreat My father in my favour. A great fault Didst thou commit. I come to tell thee of it. And grant, kind Heaven, that I alone may feel Its punishment! He deign'd to make a shew Of austere pity, and pronounced my pardon, Pledge of redoubled persecution. The spectacle of pity in another Maddens the pitiless bosom of a tyrant. Of this thy unsuspecting nature dreamt not. I come here to remind thee of this truth: And to assure thee that, of storms of hatred, In Philip's nature, pity is the prelude. A terror that my heart ne'er knew before From that sad instant seized it. I am confoundedâ In language new he spake to me. Of love, Of unaccustom'd love, made vain display. Ah, never more to him pronounce my name. Isa. To me he first spoke of thee; and almost Constrain'd me to reply. His boiling rage Seemed by my accents wholly pacified. And now when he had just addressed himself To thee, in accents of paternal love, He wept, and praised thee in my presence. Think, He is thy father: nor can I believe That thee, his only son, he does not love. Resentment blinds thee. Thou supposest in him Hatred that cannot in his heart take root. Ah, hapless destiny, I am the cause That thou art from him estranged. Car. Oh, noble lady, Ill dost thou know us both. I hate him not, Although I shudder at his presence. True, I envy him a prize of which he's robb'd me, And which he merits not. Its matchless worth, No, no, he cannot feel. Yet, wert thou blest, My grief were less intense. Isa. Spite of thyself Thou turn'st to thy accustom'd lamentations. Carlos, farewell. Henceforward be assured That I will weigh with care my every word Ere I pronounce thy name in Philip's presence. I also fear ... the son more than the father. SCENE THE SECOND. Carlos. Car. Oh, noble heart! ill fitted for suspicion, I fear thy destiny ... But who approaches? SCENE THE THIRD. Gomez, Carlos. Car. What will'st thou, Gomez? Gom. I expect the king, Who, at this hour, enjoin'd me here to meet him. Mean time, oh prince, admit me to a share Of the just transport which must overwhelm thee On the recover'd favour of thy father. As far as I have credit in his presence, I do assure thee I have always spoken In thy behalf. Command me to thy service, And I am ready further to assist thee. SCENE THE FOURTH. Gomez. Gom. Intolerably proud, but more incautious. SCENE THE FIFTH. Philip, Leonardo, Perez, Gomez, Counsellors, and Guards. Phi. Guards! see that no one dare to enter here.â I summon you, my faithful few adherents, To an unusual meeting. Listen to me. But, ere I speak, what horror overwhelms me! What icy coldness shoots through all my veins! In my eye stands the tear. My tremulous voice, As if it feared to be the instrument Of my heart's heaviness, in broken accents FaultersâShould I give utterance then? I oughtâ Not I, my country wills it. Who would think it? Among you here convened I seat myself The accuser, not the judge: that cannot be.â And were not I of such a criminal The accuser, who would hazard the attempt?â Ah, me! e'en now I see you take the alarm; All shudder.âWhat will then your feelings be When I'm constrained to speak the name ... of Carlos? Leon. Thy only son? Per. Of what can he be guilty? Phi. By an ungrateful son my peace is ruin'd! That peace, which each of you, more blest than I, Feels in the bosom of his family!â In vain have I adopted towards my son Rigour, with mildness temper'd; vainly tried By warm reproof to encourage him to virtue. To entreaty, and example, deaf alike, And still more deaf to menaces, he adds One trespass to another; and to these Impious presumption. So that, at their height, This day has filled the measure of his crimes. Yes, though I gave to him this day new proofs Of indiscreet affection, he selects This very day to give his father's heart Proofs of a veteran impiety.â Scarce had the glowing orb, which rules the day, The shining witness of my daily actions, Retired to cheer my transatlantic realm, Than with the shades of night, to traitors friendly, A project horrible and black arose Within the heart of Carlos. Silently, To avenge himself for his forgiven crimes, He steels with murderous foot towards my chamber. His right-hand with a parricidal sword He dared to arm: Approached me unawares; The weapon lifts; and almost buries it In my debilitated frame ... when, lo! All unexpectedly, a voice exclaims,â âPhilip, be on thy guard!â It was Rodrigo That came to me. At the same time I feel The stroke, as of a lightly grazing sword Defeated of its aim. My eager eyes Glance through the obscure distance. At my feet A naked sword I see; and in swift flight Remote, amid the night's uncertain shadows, Behold my son. I now have told you all. If there be those among my friends convened, Who can accuse him of another fault; If there be those who can of this fault clear him, Speak without hesitation: and may Heaven Inspire his utterance! This is no light question. My counsellors, deliberately weigh it. A solemn judgment you are now convened To pass upon my son, and on myself. Gom. What dost thou ask, oh king? Can we betray Philip, betray ourselves? But can we plunge The murderous weapon in a father's heart?â Put not our truth to so severe a test.â Leon. The day may come, oh king, when thou thyself May'st bitterly repent to have heard the truth; When thou may'st make us also, who thus dare To speak it in thy ears, repent our rashness. Per. The truth can never injure. From our lips It is required; be it not then suppressed. Phi. The king, and not the father, listens to you. Gom. I will then speak the first; the first will brave The anger of a father; for thou art A father still; and in that countenance Artfully stern, less menacing than troubled, 'Tis plain that if the monarch condemns Carlos, The son the father pardons: his misdeeds Thou wilt not, perhaps can'st not, enumerate. It seems a light delinquency to Carlos To make a compact with thy rebel subjects: Here is a paper found upon his person, In which at once he covenants our ruin, And his own infamy. He dares to treat With France, yes, with detested France to treat. Here you will read an infamous surrender Of Catalonia and Navarre, proposed, And other fertile provinces, attached By our forefathers' valour, and retained By sweat and blood of our contemporaries, To the throne of Spain. A portion so important Of such a mighty realm, prey to the French, Is offered as the execrable price Of execrable aid, against the father, Lent to the son; and what remains of Spain Will be oppressed with foul impunity By that deceitful offspring of a father, Whose sense, whose strength, are competent to wield The sceptre of the universal world. Behold what destiny awaits us.âAh! Thy life is indispensable, oh king, To us, thy sacred life! But equally The far-famed glory of the Spanish empire To us is indispensable and sacred. 'Tis guilt in all its worst atrocity To seek to assassinate a king and father; But in one moment to betray one's honour, One's country to betray (I am compelled Thus by a dire necessity to speak,) Perhaps is no less a crime. The forfeiture By which thou art injured, thy paternal heart Might perhaps extenuate: but the other crime? ... That also thou might'st be inclined to pardon:â But when they both in foul array are join'd, With such a list of trait'rous trespasses, What other doom can I pronounce than death? Per. Death! Is it death thou sayest? Phi. Merciful heavens!â Leon. Who would believe that I am compelled to add To the execrable names of parricide, Traitor and rebel, one more foul than these? Yet there remains another epithet Of such atrocity, that mortal tongue Dare scarcely give it utterance. Phi. It is? ... Leon. Blasphemer of the majesty of Heaven.â Oh God omnipotent, deign to inspire The utterance of thy vile, yet faithful servant! The day is come, the moment is arrived, When thou, with one retributory flash Of thy tremendous and avenging looks, Shalt cast to earth him, who, in pride of heart, Hath long presumed thy terrors to defy. Thou raisest me up as an instrument Of thy offended majesty; and givest My swelling breast a super-human boldness; A boldness worthy of the cause.âOh hear, Thou monarch of the earth, by my lips hear, What, in his terrors, the offended king Of Heaven inspires. The prince, whom I account So impious, that I dare not of my king Call him the son; the prince unceasingly, With lips impure, pronounces blasphemies, No less injurious to high heaven itself Than to its hallowed ministers. The cry, The cry prophane reaches the house of God: He mocks the worship of his ancestors, And patronizes the new heresy: And we should see, were he upon the throne, The sacred altars levelled with the ground, And each mysterious symbol of our worship Trodden to dust with sacrilegious feet.â Yes, we should see it. But if till that time The flaming sword of God delay'd its office, A sight like this should never blast my eyes. They who preferred not death to such a sight Alone should witness it. I would not see The sacred veil profanely torn away; That salutary veil that hides the truth From minds, which, though they comprehend it not, Believe it, and its functionaries dread: Nor witness the iniquitous destruction, Which, in his fury, he has sworn to accomplish, Of that august tribunal, which, on earth, Presents an image of supernal justice, And makes that justice less inflexible: Of that tribunal, which preserves entire, To the confusion of less favour'd climes, The faith transmitted to our ancestors. May Heaven confound the impious wish! May hell In vain conspire to aid it! Lift thine eyes, Thou earthly monarch, to the King of Heaven. To him thou owest thy life, thy power, thy honour. He can take all away. If he is offended, Thy son's the culprit. Look on him, and see The fatal sentence legibly inscribed. Without delay fulfil it: on his head, That Heaven, which he has outraged, hurls its vengeance. Per. From servile bosoms 'tis not hard to gain, In a bad cause, opinions frankly spoken. Nor is it seldom that the sentiments Most freely uttered are themselves constrained; And baseness in its multifarious changes Can clothe itself in feigned audacity.â Listen to me, oh king, and thou shalt hear Free thoughts expressed with freedom. Listen to me, And thou shalt see another sort of boldness. The scroll is forged. The accusers disagree, And contradict each other. If the prince With parricidal hand approached his father, What from the foolish compact could he hope With the Batavian rebels? To what purpose The succour of the French? Why share with them His heritage? Divide, without a motive, Realms over which he held a rightful sway? But if by means so impious and strange He wished to alleviate his own destiny, Why so incautiously attempt the deed? Or why contrive such guilt, and in the midst Desist? Baffled by whom? If such a crime, By such a means he attempted, I account him Rather a madman than a murderer. He knows that always in defence of kings (E'en though they hate them) emulously watch Those who derive from them power, wealth, and rank. Thou sawest thy son in flight. I shrewdly guess Thou sawest him with the eyes of other men. Let him come here, and speak in his own cause. In the mean time, that he has not assailed Thy life I swear, yea, by my head, I swear it; Or, if that oath suffice not, by my honour:â That honour o'er which kings have no controul. What shall I say of the impiety, In which, with tones of holy indignation, A lying piety hath dared to impeach him? What boots it that I say that those there are, Beneath a veil of well-assumed devotion, Who hide the basest motives; they confound Their interests with the interests of Heaven, And artfully, with a feigned zeal, contrive To be the ministers of blood and outrage? Who knows it not? And further I affirm, The prince hath always proved that he possessed A heart humane, a lofty sense of honour, A soul as beauteous as the form it dwelt in: His father's fondest hopes he realized, E'en from his earliest years: Thou said'st 'twas so, And all believe thy words. I think so still. 'Tis not in nature that a mind should pass, Distinguished for its virtue, to the height, At once, of guilt. That he has always suffered His wrongs, so many, and so oft repeated, With silence, weeping, and profound submission, I can bear witness. 'Tis a truth, though strange, That tears are construed sometimes into guilt; And there are hearts of such a wrathful mould, That grief, instead of pity, wakes their anger. Ah, thou art a father ... harden not thy heart ... Weep with thy weeping son; he is not guilty; But of the wretched, wretchedest of men. Yet if he were ten thousand times more guilty Than any here, who would blaspheme his nature, Yell out in hate, a father never can, Nor ought he, to condemn his son to death. Phi. Pity, at last, I find in one of you, And pity shall obey. Father I am; And to the feelings of a father yield. Myself, my kingdom, all that I possess, I do abandon to the arbitrement Inscrutable of Heaven. Carlos, perchance, Is th'instrument towards me of Heaven's displeasure. Perish my kingdom, perish Philip rather, But let my son be safe. I pardon him. Gom. Thou mak'st thyself, then, greater than the laws. Why summon us? Thou mayest without our aid Evade the laws. Absolve, absolve, thou mayest: But if one day pity be fatal to thee ... Per. Pity like this, indeed, will fatal prove: 'Tis too unusual to portend a blessing. But I protest, whate'er the event may be, That this debate, to which I've rashly ventured, Is not a council. Life I value not; My fame I still hold dear. The world shall know That I've not bathed my hands in innocent blood. Let those who will remain. To Heaven alone My silent prayers I raise: the truth to Heaven Is manifest ... Why do I say to Heaven? If I look round me, am I not convinced That all whom I survey know the whole truth? That all conceal it? That to hear it, speak it, Hath here long been a capital offence? Phi. To whom speak'st thou? Per. Of Carlos to his father! Phi. And to his king. Leon. Thou art the sire of Carlos, And who in thee the conflict does not trace Of a despairing father? Recollect That thou art father also of thy subjects, And that as much as he despises it, They prize the sacred name. The prince is one; They, an innumerable multitude. That one protect, the rest are all in danger. He is criminal. The rest all innocent. Dost doubt whether to save that one, or all? Phi. Do not thus, by reiterated thrusts, Plunge in my heart the dagger. Pause awhile: I have not strength to listen to you more. Let a new council forthwith be assembled Out of my sight. There let the priests assist, In whom all worldly impulses are dead. By their means truth may be promulgated, And truth alone obeyed. Meet, and pass sentence. What's just my presence might too much constrain, Or bring to too severe a test my virtue. SCENE THE SIXTH. Philip. Phi. Oh, what may be the number of the traitors? Can Perez be so bold? Has he perhaps read My secret heart? ... ah, no! ... but yet what boldness! What vehement pride! And can a soul so form'd Spring where I reign? or where I reign exist?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Carlos. Car. Shadows of night, far more than beams of day, Suiting the horrors of this guilty palace, With mournful joy I witness your return! 'Tis not, that from your influence, my grief Finds intermission: but that, for a time, I lose the sight of faces that appal me. Here did Elvira pledge herself to meet me In Isabella's name. The cause I know not. What profound silence! ... mid their gnawing cares, Spite of remorse, and spite of dark suspicion, Calm sleep descends on overshadowing wing To seal the eyes of tyrants and of traitors! That sleep, that, like a faithless parasite, Avoids the eyes of innocence oppressed! But sleepless nights to me are not unwelcome: I hold communion with the dear impression Of all that's fair and virtuous. 'Tis my solace Here to return where last I parted from her, And heard expressions, that in one swift moment Gave me both life and death. Ah, far less wretched, But far more criminal, than heretofore, I deem myself since that eventful meeting ... Whence does this visionary horror rise? Is it the pain that wrings a guilty conscience? Yet wherefore? How have I been criminal? I have given utterance: and who that felt Such throes of passion ever could conceal them? I hear, or seem to hear, approaching footsteps. Elivira comes ... ah, no! what deafening clamour! Who is't approaches? What a flash of torches! Armed, and towards me? Traitors, advance ... SCENE THE SECOND. Soldiers, with Arms and Torches. Philip, Carlos. Car. Oh, heavens! My father, with so many arm'd attendants? Phi. At night, alone, arm'd, and in these apartments, What art thou doing? what dost meditate? Whither art going? Speak. Car. ... What shall I say? The arms I grasp'd at the supposed approach Of bloody ruffians, in my father's presence Fall from my hands. Dost thou conduct them? Thou, My father? At thy will dispose of me. But tell me, was it needful to use pretexts? And such as these? Ah, father! pretexts are Unworthy of a king; apologies From my lips now were only more unworthy. Phi. Dost add presumption to thy other crimes? Display it then, for evermore it is The sure attendant of consummate guilt. Thou throw'st a cloak of ill-assumed respect Over thy faithless and ambitious nature; Thou dost not seek to palliate thy offences: To give full vent to thy atrocious rage Would better suit thy purpose. Pour it out, The deadly poison that thy heart contains. With a magnanimous audacity Confess at once each machination dire, Worthy of one in treason so accomplish'd! Car. What have I to confess? Spare me, oh father, These useless outrages. Chuse at thy will What torture suits thee best; if it please thee, I question not its justice. Phi. By what means, In such an unripe age, hast thou attain'd To this perfection of atrocity? How hast thou so consummately acquired The art of wickedness, that, by thy king, Caught in this monstrous crime, thou wear'st the mien Of innocence? Car. Where did I learn it, father? Born in thy palace ... Phi. Villain, thou wert born there To my disgrace and shame! Car. Why dost thou doubt That shame to wipe away? who knows it not? Thou thirstest for the life-blood of thy son? Phi. My son art thou! Car. But what have I committed? Phi. Ask'st thou that question? ask'st thou it of me? Does no compunction agonize thy heart? Ah, no! Thou long, long since of such a weakness Hast got clear riddance. 'Tis a pang thou know'st not; Except thou feel it, since in thought alone, And not in act, thou art a parricide. Car. A parricide! What do I hear? A parricide? Thyself dost not believe it: what suspicion, What probability, what proof, hast thou? Phi. Suspicion, probability, and proof, Thy contumelious aspect yields them all. Car. Oh, father, father, do not drive me on Those holiest of bounds to violate, Which Heaven, which nature, and the laws, have placed Between a king and subject, son and father. Phi. Thy sacrilegious character long since Has passed those bounds. What do I say? those bounds Were never binding on thy froward nature. Use not, for ill they suit thee, any longer The pompous phrases of a high-soul'd virtue. At once confess to me thy many plots Projected and accomplished. Speak, what fear'st thou? That I am less magnanimous than thou vile? If thou wilt speak the truth, the whole truth, hope; If thou equivocate, or be silent, fear. Car. I speak the truth; 'tis thou compell'st me to it. I know myself too well ever to fear; And thee too well I know ever to hope. A luckless gift, take thou my life, for thine It is to take; my honour is my own, Thou gav'st it not, nor canst thou take it from me. Guilty I should be, could I stoop to own A guilt to which my nature is a stranger. Thou shalt here see me breathe my last; a death Lingering, opprobrious, full of agonies, Do thou prepare. Death, in its direst shape, Cannot degrade me, cannot make me tremble. Thee, thee alone, and not myself, I pity. Phi. Presumptuous youth! and dar'st thou, to thy king, Thus give account of thy misdeeds? Car. Account? Thou hatest me, that is my sole misdeed; Thirstest to have my blood, my only crime: Thou art absolute, this constitutes thy right. Phi. Guards, mark me, he is your prisoner. Car. The reply Is this, usual to tyrants. Here's my arm, I yield it to the fetters: here my breast, I bare it to thy sword. Dost hesitate? Hast only learned to-day to play the tyrant? Day after day thy reign is registered In characters indelible of blood. Phi. Guards, drag him from my presence; and confine him In yon adjacent tower's profoundest dungeon. Death to the slave that listens to his pleadings. Car. Thou need'st not fear, thy minions emulate In cruelty their king. Phi. Drag him by force; By force and violence drag him from my presence. SCENE THE THIRD. Isabella, Philip. Isa. Oh, heavens! what do I see? Phi. What ails thee, lady? Isa. Throughout the palace shrieks of fear resound. Phi. Perchance, thou hast heard the cry of fear? ... Isa. Alas! Did not I see the prince dragged from thy presence? Phi. Thine eyes deceived thee not. Isa. Thy only son? Phi. Does my wife tremble and wax pale to see it? Isa. I tremble! Phi. And 'tis not without a cause. Thy trembling ... is ... to me ... no light assurance ... Of thy affection ... For thy husband ... fear'st thou? But reassure thy heart, the peril's vanished. Isa. Peril? ... and how? Phi. Peril most imminent: But now my life is in security. Isa. Thy life? ... Phi. To thee so dear, and so essential, Is safe. Isa. The traitor? Phi. Shall have punishment Due to his crime. To infatuated pity Think not that I again shall yield my heart. That time is past; and now I hear alone The austere and importuning voice of justice. Isa. What is the plot? Phi. Oh, Heaven! perhaps I alone Was not its object. He who thirsts to shed The life-blood of a father, if he hate His father's wife, as much as he hates him, Would little scruple, by one master stroke, To end both lives at once. Isa. My life? what say'st thou? Alas! The prince ... Phi. Ungrateful as he is, Forgets no less thy benefits than mine. But thou return to whence thou cam'st; live happy, And leave to me the important trust t'assure Thy peace and mine at once. SCENE THE FOURTH. Isabella. Isa. What accents, what an aspect! I am palsied, And scarcely can tell where or what I am! What did he say? what did he not say? ah! Has he my love detected? no, no; that Yet in the inmost chambers of my breast In safety lies. Yet what a piercing look, Flashing with indignation, he fixed on me! Alas! he afterwards did speak to me Of father's wife ... what said he of my peace? What said I in reply? Named I the prince? Oh, what cold horror shoots through all my veins! Where is he gone? and what does he project? Meanwhile what am I doing? I will try To follow him: but, oh! the power is wanting. SCENE THE FIFTH. Gomez, Isabella. Gom. Pardon my too great boldness; but I sought, And here expected to have found, the king. Isa. He quitted me this instant. Gom. I'm compell'd To seek him then elsewhere. Undoubtedly He feels impatient the event to know. Isa. Event? a moment stay: say what thou meanest ... Gom. If thou hast spoken to him, he has told thee His doubtful expectation of the sentence About to be pronounced. Isa. No: but to me, He, in obscure and most ambiguous terms, Hinted of treason. Gom. Did he not tell thee, then, The traitor's name? Isa. The prince ... Gom. Thou know'st it all. I from the council come ... Isa. What council? whence? Alas! what tidings dost thou bring to him? Gom. The mighty business was discuss'd at length, And with one voice at length it was concluded. Isa. What? Speak? ... Gom. 'Tis written in this scrollâthe sentence. The royal signature alone is wanting. Isa. The tenor of it then ... Gom. Is death. Isa. Assassins! Death? and of what offence is he convicted? Gom. Did, then, the king conceal it from thee? Isa. Yes. He spoke it not. Gom. Th'offence of parricide. Isa. Carlos! oh, heavens! Gom. The father is the accuser. Isa. The father? ... and what proofs can he adduce? False proofs. Ah, surely, there are other crimes From me concealed. Tell me his real trespass. Gom. His real trespass? If thou dost not know it, Can I reveal it to thee? Such incaution Might risk my life. Isa. Alas! what dost thou say? Art apprehensive that I shall betray thee? Gom. Further disclosure would betray the king. But whence arises such an anxious wish To investigate the truth? Isa. I? ... I am urged By curiosity alone. Gom. But tell me, What interest hast thou in this transaction? In imminent danger is the prince, perhaps Will fall a victim to it. But to him What tie, save that of father's wife, can bind thee? Thy interests are not injured by his death. Rather to children who from thee may spring It clears the passage to the throne. Attend. In part, at least, of Carlos's trangressions, The first, and real origin, is love. Isa. What say'st thou? Gom. Love, with which the king beholds thee. Yes, it would please him far more to behold A son of thine inheriting his throne, Than e'er to see his successor in Carlos. Isa. I breathe again. What base regards in me Presum'st thou to imagine? Gom. I presume The feelings of my monarch to express: They are not, no, such are not mine; but I ... Isa. 'Tis true, then, that which I could ne'er suspect, The father ... yes, the father ... hates his son? Gom. Ah, lady, how much do I pity thee, If thou hast, hitherto, so little known The king. Isa. But, ah! in whom then may I trust? Thou perhaps ... Gom. Since pity I behold in thee, That profound silence which oppresses me For once I lay aside. 'Tis too, too true, The prince is guilty of no other crime But that of being son of such a father. Isa. Thou mak'st me shudder. Gom. I am stricken, lady, With no less horror than thyself. Dost know Whence this unnatural hate derives its source? From envy.âPhilip's simulated virtue Cannot endure th'upbraiding spectacle Of undissembled virtue in a son. Too great a contrast to himself he sees him; And, impious in his envy, he prefers To that superiority his death. Isa. Unnatural father! but since it condemns To death the guiltless, I esteem the council More guilty than the king. Gom. To such a king What council could oppose itself? Th'accuser Sits on the throne: the accusation's false: Each knows this; but each, trembling for himself, Silent in mercy's cause, affirms its truth; On us the blot of guilty judgment falls; Vile instruments of cruelty in powerâ Shuddering we are so: but in vain we shudder; He who dared question what the monarch wishes, Would quickly fall a victim of his vengeance. Isa. Can that be truth which now I hear? struck dumb Am I with blank astonishment. No hope Doth there remain? Must he unjustly perish? Gom. The monarch in profound dissimulation More than in aught is skilled. He will affect To hesitate at first; a vain display Of pity and of grief will doubtless make, Perhaps for a time procrastinate decision. Fool will he be, that, in that well-feigned struggle, Believes that real grief or pity enter; That in that heart, because it may delay, Profound resentment swerves from its fix'd purpose. Isa. Ah! if thou have not equally with him Thy soul by crimes indurated, do thou, Ah, do thou, Gomez, be compassionate. Gom. What can I do? Isa. Perchance ... Gom. With fruitless tears, But carefully concealed, I may embalm The memory of that murdered innocent. More I cannot perform. Isa. Of such dire guilt, Who ever saw, who ever heard, a deed? Gom. If it were possible to save the prince, Prompt would I be to sacrifice myself; To this bear witness, Heaven: With fell remorse In all its bitterness, the consequence Of fatal friendship with so dark a tyrant, My bosom with excruciating pangs Is gnaw'd; but ... Isa. If it be sincere in thee, This deep remorse, thou mayest befriend him still; Yes, thou may'st do it, and not risk thyself. The king suspects thee not; thou may'st afford him Means of escape clandestinely: and who Th'assistance would betray? Nay, who can tell But that in future moments of compunction, Philip, the generous boldness may reward Of one, that saved his glory and his son. Gom. And if, perchance, I dared do this, think'st thou That Carlos would consent? How proud he is Thou knowest. Already I foresee his rage, In hearing only the mere name of flight And sentence. Ah! each messenger of death, That haughty and unconquerable nature Would seek in vain t'intimidate. E'en now I see him obstinately bent on death. Further, all counsel and all aid from me Would be at once suspicious and offensive. He deems me the confederate of the king. Isa. Is there no other obstacle? Contrive For me to see him; to his prison guide me: Thou surely hast access; I fondly hope To persuade him to flight. Refuse me not A favour so immense. As yet the night Is not far spent. Meanwhile do thou the means For his escape prepare; do thou delay The presentation of the fatal sentence, Which, perhaps, the king doth not expect so soon. Thou hearest, ... Do not disappoint my prayers; In such a cause the heavens shall be propitious: I do conjure thee to exert thyself. Gom. Who could refuse so merciful an office? At all events the effort will I make. Advance. The heavens suffer not to perish, Except those victims who deserve to perish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Carlos. Car. What have I now to hope, what fear, but death? Ah, might I have it free from infamy! But from the cruelty of Philip's nature, Fraught with contrivances, I must expect it, T'increase its infamy. One doubt alone, Far worse than any death, afflicts my heart, Perhaps he knows my love: Erewhile I saw, In the fierce lightenings of his countenance, I know not what of bitterness, that seemed, Spite of himself, his meaning to betray ... His conversation with the queen erewhile ... His summons to myself; th'observing look ... His scrutinizing keenness ... what forebode they? ... Oh, Heaven! what would her fate be should his wife Excite the wrath of his suspicious nature? Perhaps even now the cruel tyrant wreaks Vengeance on her for an uncertain fault; Vengeance that always, from a lawless despot, Precedes the misdemeanour. But if to all, And almost to ourselves, our love's unknown, Whence should he learn it? Have my sighs perchance Betray'd my meaning? What? Shall love's soft sighs Be by a guilty tyrant understood? ... To make him furious and unnatural, Say was it needful to a sire like this To penetrate my love? His vengeful hate Had reached its height, and could not brook delay. The day at length is come, the day is come When I may satisfy his thirst for blood. Ah! treacherous troops of friends that crowded round me In my prosperity! where are ye now? I only ask of you a sword; a sword, By means of which t'escape from infamy, Not one of you will bring me ... whence that noise? The iron gate grates on its hinges! Ah! What next may I expect? Who comes there? Ho! SCENE THE SECOND. Isabella, Carlos. Car. Queen, is it thou? Who was thy guide? What cause Hither conducted thee? Love, duty, pity? How did'st thou gain admission? Isa. Wretched prince, Thou know'st not yet the horrors of thy fate. Thou as a parricide art stigmatized. Thy sire himself accuses thee; to death A mercenary council hath condemn'd thee; Nothing is wanting to complete the sentence But the assent of Philip. Car. Is that allâ That soon will follow. Isa. Art thou not o'erwhelm'd? Car. 'Tis long since nought but death has been my choice. Thou know'st it well, of whom I nothing asked But leave to breathe my last where thou didst dwell. 'Tis hardâthe horrible aspersionâhard! Not unexpected. I'm compell'd to die; And can I shudder if thou bring the tidings? Isa. Ah! if thou love me, do not talk of death. Yet, for a short time, to th'emergency ... Car. Yield! ... now I fear that thou hast undertaken The cruel office to degrade my nature. My vengeful father hath deputed thee ... Isa. And canst thou think it, prince, that I am then The minister of Philip's cruelty? ... Car. He may to this constrain thee, perhaps deceive thee. But wherefore then has he permitted thee To see me in this dungeon? Isa. Thinkest thou That Philip knows it? That indeed were death. Car. What say'st thou? Nothing can escape his knowledge. Who dares to violate his fierce commands? Isa. Gomez. Car. Oh, then, we are utterly undone! What an abominable, fatal name Hast thou pronounced! ... Isa. Thou deem'st of him unjustly. He is not thy enemy. Car. If I believed He were my friend, my countenance would burn With shame, more than with anger. Isa. He alone Feels pity for thy fate: to me confessed Philip's atrocious plot. Car. Incautious queen! Thou art too credulous! what hast thou done? Why didst thou trust to such a feigned compassion? Of th'impious king most impious minister, If he spoke truth, 'twas with the truth to cheat thee. Isa. What could it profit him? Of his compassion Undoubted proofs I quickly can display, If thou wilt yield to my entreaties. He By stealth conducted me to this recess; Prepares the means of thy escape: 'twas I That influenced him. No longer tarry, fly! Fly from thy father, fly from death and me! Car. While thou hast time, ah, hasten from my presence. Gomez, without his reasons, feigned not pity. Into what snare art fallen! Now, oh queen, Indeed I shudder! Now what doubt remains? The secret of our love he knows it allâ The kingâthe cruel king! Isa. Ah, no! erewhile Philip I saw, when, from his presence, thou, By dint of force, wert dragg'd. He burn'd with rage. Trembling I listened to him, not exempt From fears like thine. But when in solitude His converse I recall'd, I felt secure, That, rather than of this, his fury taxed thee With every other crime. To sum up all, He charged thee, in connection with his own, Of thirsting for my blood. Car. 'Twould be a toil That made me vile as he, yea, e'en more vile, The dark perplexities to penetrate Of guilt's inextricable labyrinth. But, sure I am, that this thy embassy Conceals some bad design. That which till now He but suspected, by this deed of thine He hopes to bring to a more certain proof. But, be it what it may, quickly depart From this disastrous place. Thy hope is vain, Vain thy belief that Gomez wills to serve me, Or, if he willed it, that I should consent. Isa. And must I then drag on my wretched days Midst beings such as these? ... Car. 'Tis too, too true! Delay not now a moment: leave me; save me From agonies insufferably keen! Thy pity wounds me, since for thyself it feels not ... Go, if thou hold life dear ... Isa. Life dear to me! Car. My honour, then, preserve it, and thy fame. Isa. And in such danger must I quit thee thus? Car. Ah, what avails it to expose thyself? Thyself thou ruinest, and sav'st not me. Virtue is spotted even by suspicion. Ah! from the tyrant snatch the hellish joy Of casting imputation on thy name. Goâdry thy tearsâand still thy heaving bosom. With a dry eye, and an intrepid brow, Hear of my death! To virtue's cause devote The mournful days in which thou shalt outlive me. And if among so many guilty creatures Thou seekest consolation, one remains; Perez, thou know'st him well, clandestinely Will weep with thee. To him sometimes speak of me. But goâdepart! Ah, tempt me not to weep ... Tear not my heart little by little thus! I cannot bear it. Now farewell for ever! I've need to summon all my fortitude To meet the hour of ignominious death. SCENE THE THIRD. Philip, Isabella, Carlos. Phi. Perfidious wretch! that hour of death is come; I bring it to thee. Isa. Are we thus betrayed? Car. I am prepared for death. Give it at once. Phi. Wretch, thou shalt die! but first, ye impious pair, My fulminating accents hear, and tremble! Impious pair! long, long, I've known it all. That horrid flame that burns in you with love, In me with fury, long has fix'd its torment, And long been all discover'd! Oh, what pangs Of rage repress'd! Oh, what resentment smother'd! At last ye both are fallen in my power. Should I lament? or deign to express regret? No! I for vengeance thirsted! and I now Will in illimitable vengeance revel, Quick, unexampled vengeance! On your shame Meanwhile I feast my eyes. Flagitious dame, Think not I ever bore thee any love; Nor that a jealous thought within my heart E'er woke a pang. Philip could never deign On a degraded bosom, such as thine, To fix th'affections of his lofty nature; Nor could a lady who deserved betray them. Thou hast in me thy king offended, then, And not thy lover. Thou, unworthily, Hast thus, my consort's name, that sacred name, Basely contaminated. I never prized Thy love: but such inviolable duty Thou should'st have felt towards thy lord and king, As should have made thee e'en at a frail thought Shudder with horror.âThou, seducer vile, To thee I speak not. Guilt becomes thy nature: The deed was worthy of its impious author. There wanted not indubitable proofs, Although concealed your criminal regard. Your silence, and your gestures, and the grief Pent up alike in both your impious hearts, I watched them all. Now what more shall I say? Equal in crimes, your torments shall be equal. Car. What do I hear? There is no fault in her: No fault? not e'en the shadow of a fault! Pure is her heart, with such flagitious flame It never burned, I swear. She scarcely knew My loveâthe trespass then ... Phi. To what extent Ye, each of you, are criminal, I know. I know, as yet, that to thy father's bed Thou hast not raised thy bold and impious thoughts. Had it been otherwise, would'st thou now live? But from thy impure mouth there issued accents, Flagitious accents, of incestuous love. She heard them: that suffices ... Car. I alone Offended thee: I seek not to conceal it. A rapid flash of hope athwart my sight Shotâbut her virtue instantly dispell'd it. She heard me, but 'twas only to my shame: Only to root entirely from my bosom The illegitimate passion that it fostered ... Yes, now, alas! too illegitimate ... Yet it was once a lawful, noble passion: She was my spouse betrothedâmy spouse, thou know'stâ Thou gav'st her to me; and the gift was lawful, But 'twas not lawful in thee to resume it. Yes, I am criminal in every shape; I love her: thou hast made that love a crime ... What can'st thou now take from me? In my blood Satiate thy wrath; and gratify in me The exacerbation of thy jealous pride; Spare her, for she is wholly innocent. Phi. She? Not to thee in guilt she yields, but boldness.â Be silent, lady, of thine own accord. That silence does sufficiently betray thee. 'Tis useless to deny it, thou dost cherish An illegitimate passion. Thou betray'dst itâ Enoughâtoo much betray'dst it, when I spoke, With artful purposes, of him to thee: Why then didst thou so pertinaciously Remind me that he was my son? Oh, traitress, Thou dared'st not, yet rather should'st have said, He was thy lover. Hast thou less than he, Dost thou imagine, in thy secret heart, Betrayed thy duty, honour, and the laws? Isa. My silence from my fear does not arise; But from the stupor that benumbs my senses At the incredible duplicity Of thy blood-thirsty, ravening heart. At length My scatter'd senses I once more recover. 'Tis time, 'tis time, that for the heinous fault I should atone, of being wife to thee. Till now I've not offended thee. Till now, In God's sight, in the prince's, I am guiltless. Although within my breast ... Car. Pity for me Inspires her words: ah, hear her not ... Isa. In vain Thou triest to save me. Every word of thine Is as a puncture, which exasperates The wounds of his proud breast. The time is past For palliatives. To shun his hated sight, The torment of whose presence nought can equal, Is now my only refuge. Were it given To one that is a tyrant e'er to feel The power of love, I would remind thee, king, That thou at first didst form our mutual ties, That, from my earliest years, my fondest thoughts, My dearest hopes, were centred all in him; With him I trusted to live blessed and blessing. To love him then, at once, in me was virtue, And to thy will submission. Who but thou Made what was virtue guilt? Thou didst the deed. Ties the most holy thou didst burst asunder,â An easy task to one that's absolute. But does the heart change thus? His image lay Deeply engraven there. But instantly That I became thy wife the flame was smothered. And I depended afterwards on time, And on my virtue, wholly to surmount it; And, peradventure, more than e'en on these Depended on thyself. Phi. I will then now, What neither years, nor virtue, have perform'd, Do instantly: yes, in thy faithless blood I'll quench the impure flame. Isa. Yes, to spill blood, And, when that blood is spilled, to spill more blood, Is thy most choice prerogative: but, oh! Is it by a prerogative like this Thou hopest to win me from him to thee? To thee, as utterly unlike thy son, As is, from virtue, vice? Thou hast been wont To see me tremble; but I fear no more; My illegitimate passion, for as such My passion I accounted, I concealed: Now shall it be without disguise proclaimed, Since thy dark crimes have made it shew like virtue. Phi. He is worthy of thee; thou of him art worthy. It now remains to prove, if, as in words, Ye will be bold in death ... SCENE THE FOURTH. Gomez, Philip, Isabella, Carlos. Phi. Gomez, hast thou All my commands fulfill'd? What I enjoined thee Dost thou now bring? Gom. Perez has breathed his last. Behold the sword, that with his smoking blood Yet reeks. Car. Oh sight! Phi. With him is not extinguished The race of traitors ... Be thou witness now How I take vengeance on this impious pair. Car. Before I die, alas! how many deaths I'm destined to behold. Thou, Perez, too? ... Oh, infamy! now, now I follow thee. Where is the sword to which my breast is fated? Quick, bring it to me. May my blood alone, Of this fell tyger, slake the burning thirst. Isa. Oh I, oh I alone can pacify His murderous appetite! Phi. Cease your vile contest. This dagger, and this cup, await your choice. Thou, proud contemner as thou art, of death, Chuse first. Car. Oh, weapon of deliverance, With innocent blood yet reeking, thee I chuse!â Oh, luckless lady, thou hast said too much: For thee no refuge now remains but death: But, ah! the poison chuse, for this will be Most easy ... Of my inauspicious love The last sad proof is this. Collect at once All, all thy fortitude; and look on me. He stabs himself. I die ... do thou now follow my example ... Bring, bring the fatal cup ... do not delay ... Isa. Ah, yes, I follow thee. Oh, Death, to me Thou art most welcome; in thee ... Phi. Thou shalt live, Spite of thyself, shalt live. Isa. Ah, let me die; Excruciating lot! he dies, and I ... Phi. Severed from him shalt live; live days of woe: Thy lingering grief will be a joy to me. And when at last, recovered from thy love, Thou wishest to live on, I, then, will kill thee. Isa. Live in thy presence! I support thy sight! No, that shall never be! My doom is fixed ... The cup refused, thy dagger may replace it. She darts most rapidly towards the dagger of Philip, and stabs herself with it. Phi. Stop! ... Isa. It is done! ... Phi. Heavens, what do I behold? Isa. Thou seest thy wife ... thy son ... both innocent ... And both by thy hands slain ... I follow thee, Loved Carlos. Phi. What a stream of blood runs here, And of what noble blood ... Behold I have Obtained an ample, and a horrid vengeance; ... But am I happy? Gomez, do thou hide The dire catastrophe from all the world. If thou art but discreet, thou wilt preserve To me my fame, and to thyself thy life.</field>
