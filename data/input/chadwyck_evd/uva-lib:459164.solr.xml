      <field name="fulltext">Extracts from an unpublished MS. Drama of the Seventeenth Century, entitled âLove's Victorie.â PHILISSES. Yon pleasant floury meade Which I did once well loue, Your pathes noe more I'le tread, Your pleasures noe more proue, Your beauty more admire, Your coulers more adore, Nor gras with daintiest store Of sweets to breed desire. Walks once soe sought for, now I shunn you for the darcke; Birds to whose song did bow, My eares your notes nere mark; Brooke which soe pleasing was Vpon whose banks I lay, And on my pipe did play, Now vnregarded pass. Meadowes, pathes, grass, flouers, Walkes, birds, brooke, truly finde All proue butt as vaine shouers, Wish'd wellcome els vnkind, You once I loued best, Butt loue makes mee you leaue; By loue I loue deseaueâ Joys lost for liues' vnrest. LISSIUS. Alas! what meanes this? Surely itt is loue That makes in him this alteration moue: This is the humor makes our sheapheards raue. I'le non of thisâI'le sonner seeke my graue! Loue, by your fauour, I will non of you. I rather you should miss then I should sue; Yett, Cupid, poore Philisses back restore To his first witts, and I'le affect thee more. [Exit. SILUESTA. Faire shining day! and thou, Apollo bright! Which to these pleasant vallys giues thy light, And, with sweet shouers mixt with golden beames, Inrich these meadowes and these gliding streames,â Wherin thou seest thy face like mirrour faire, Dressing in them thy curling, shining haire,â This place with sweetest flouers still doth deck, Whose coulers show theyr pride, free from the check Of fortune's frowne, soe long as Spring doth last, Butt then feele chang, wherof all others tast. As I, for one, who thus my habitts chang, Once sheapherdess, butt now in woods must rang; And after the chaste godess beare her bowe, Though seruice once to Venus I did owe, Whose seruante then I was, and of her band. But farewell, folly! I with Dian stand Against loue's changing and blind foulery, To hold with hapy and bless'd chastity; For loue is idleâhapines ther's none When freedome's lost and chastity is gone; And wher on earth most blessednes their is, Loue's fond desires neuer faile to miss; And this, beeleeue mee, you will truly find. Lett nott repentance, therfor, chang your mind, Butt chang befor your glory wilbee most, When as the waggish boy can least him bost; For hee doth seeke to kindle flames of fire, Butt neuer thinks to quench a chaste desire. Hee calls his foeâhee hates non more then those Who striues his lawe to shun, and this haue chose. All vertu hates his kingdome's wantones; His crowne desires his septer idlenes; His wounds hott fires, his helps like frost; Glad to hurt, butt neuer heales; thinks time lost If any gaine theyr long-sought ioye with bliss; And this the gouernment of folly is. Butt heere, Philisses, comes poore sheapheard lad, With loue's hott fires and his owne made mad. I must away,âmy vowe allowes noe sight Of men: yett must I pitty him, poore wight! Though hee, reiecting mee, this change haue wrought, Hee shalbee noe less worthy in my thought. Yett wish I doe hee were as free as I, Then were hee hapyânow feels misery; For, thanks to heauen and to the gods above! I have wunn chastity in place of loue. Now loue's as farr from mee as neuer knowne: Then bacely tied, now freely ame mine owne. Slauery and bondage, with mourning care, Was then my liuing sighs, and teares my fare; Butt, all these gon, now liue I ioyfully, Free and vntouch'd of thought but chastitye. [Exit. PHILISSES. Loue, beeing mist in heauen, att last was found Lodg'd in Musella's faire though cruell brestâ Cruell, alas! yett wheron I must ground All hopes of ioye, though tired with vnrest. O deerest deere! lett plaints which true felt are Gaine pitty once; doe nott delight to proue Soe mercyles, still killing with despaire, Nor pleasure take soe much to try my loue; Yett if your triall will you milder make, Try, butt nott long, least pitty come to late. Butt O! she can nott, may nott, will nott take Pitty on mee,âshe loues and lends mee hate. PHILISSES. They that can nott stedy bee, To them selues the like must see. Ficle pÅple fitly chuse, Slightly like, and soe refuse. This your fortune, who can say Heerin iustice bears nott sway? In troth, Dalina, fortune is prou'd curst To you, without desert. Dalina, this is the wurst That she can doe. 'Tis true, I haue fickle bin, And soe is shee; 'tis, then, the lesser sin. Lett her proue constant, I will her obserue; And then, as shee doth mend, I'le good deserue. ARCAS. Who choseth next, Lissius? Nott I, least such I proue. SILUESTA. Nor I; itt is sufficient I could loue. ARCAS. I'le wish for one, but fortune shall nott try On mee her tricks, whose fauours are so dry. DALINA. Non can wish, if they their wishes loue nott; Nor can they loue, if that wishings moue nott. PHILISSES. You faine would soulue this busines, Dalina. Who would I? Nay, my care's past; I loue, and his deny. Loue and Reason, once att warr, Loue came downe to end the iarr: Cupid said Loue must haue placeâ Reason, that itt was his grace. Loue then brought itt to this endâ Reason should on Loue attend; Loue takes Reason for his guidâ Reason can nott from Loue slide. This agreed, they pleas'd did part, Reason ruling Cupid's dart. Soe as sure Loue can nott miss, Since that Reason ruler is. LISSIUS. It seemes hee mist beefore hee had this guid. PHILISSES. I'me sure nott mee; I nere my hart could hid Butt hee itt found; soe, as I well may say, Had hee bin blind, I might haue stolne away; Butt soe hee saw, and rul'd with reason's might, As hee hath kil'd in mee all my delight. Hee wounded mee, alas! with double harme, And non butt hee can my distress vncharme. Another wound must cure mee, or I dy. But stay,âthis is enough; I hence will fly, And seeke the boy that strooke mee. Fare you well! Yett make nott still your pleasures proue my hell. LISSIUS. Philisses now hath left us; lett's goe back, And tend our flocks, who now our care doe lack. Yett would hee had more pleasant parted hence, Or that I could butt iudg the cause from whence Thes passions grow! itt would giue mee much ease. Since I parseaue my sight doth him displease, I'le seek him yett, and of him truly know What in him hath bred this unusuall woe; If he deny mee, then I'le sweare hee hates, Or else affects that humour which debates. SILUESTA. Silent woods, with desart's shade, Giuing peace, Wher all pleasures first ar made To increase, Giue your fauor to my mone Now my louing-time is gone; Chastity my pleasure is; Folly fledâ From hence now I seeke my blis, Cross loue dead, In your shadows I repose. You then, loue, I now haue chose. MUSELLA. Choise ill made were better left, Beeing cross; Of such choise to bee bereft Were no loss. Chastity you thus commend Doth proceed butt from loue's end; And if loue the fountane was Of your fire, Loue must chastitie surpas In desire. Loue lost, bred your chastest thoughtâ Chastity by loue is wrought. SILUESTA. O poore Musella! now I pitty thee. I see thou'rt bound who most haue made vnfree. 'Tis true disdaine of my loue made mee turne, And hapily, I think, butt you to burne In loue's faulce fires yourself. Poor soule, take heedâ Bee sure, beefor you too much pine to speede! You know I loued haueâbehold by gaine! This you dislike I purchas'd with loue's paine; And true-felt sorrow yett my answer was From (my then deere) Philisses. You must pas Vnlou'd by mee, and for your owne good leaue To vrg that which, most vrg'd, can butt deseaue Your hopes; for know Musella is my loue. As, then, of duty I should noe more moue, And this his will hee gott, yett nott his minde, For yett itt seemes you are noe less vnkind. MUSELLA. Wrong mee nott, chast Siluesta! 'Tis my greif That from poore mee hee will nott take reliefe. SILUESTA. What! will hee lose what hee did most desire? MUSELLA. Soe is hee led away with iealous fire, And this, Siluesta, butt to you I speak; For sonner should my hart with silence break, Then any els should heere mee thus much say Butt you, who I know will nott mee betray. SILUESTA. Betray Musella!âsonner will I dy! Noe, I do loue you; nor will help deny That lies in mee to bring your care to end, Or seruice which to your content may tend; For when I lou'd Philisses as my lyfe, Parseauing hee lou'd you, I kill'd the strife Which in mee was; yett doe I wish his good, And for his sake loue you, though I withstood Good fortunes. This chast lyfe well pleaseth mee, And yett ioy most if you tow hapy bee. Few would say this, butt fewer would itt doe; Butt th'one I lou'd, and loue the other two. MUSELLA. I know you lou'd him, nor could I the less Att time loue you; soe did hee posses My hart as my thought, all harts sure must yeild To loue him most and best. Who in this field Doth liue, and haue nott had some kind of touch To like him?âbutt O, you and I to much! SILUESTA. Mine is now past; tell mee now what yours is, And I'l wish butt the meanes to work you blis. MUSELLA. Then know, Siluesta, I Philisses loue; Butt hee, allthough (or that because) hee loues, Doth mee mistrust. Ah! can such mischief moue As to mistrust her who such passion proues! Butt soe hee doth, and thinks I haue Lissius made Master of my affections, which hath staid Him euer yett from letting mee itt know By words, allthough hee hids itt nott from show. Some times I faine would speake, then straite forbeare, Knowing itt most vnfittâthus woe I beare! SILUESTA. Indeed a woman to make loue is ill; Butt heere, and you may all thes sorrowes kill. Hee, poore distressed sheapherd! eu'ry morne, Befor the sunn to our eyes new is borne, Walks in this place, and heer alone doth cry Against his lyfe and your great cruelty. Now, since you loue soe much, come butt and find Him in thes woes, and show yourself butt kind; You sonne shall see a hart soe truly wunn, As you would nott itt miss to bee vndunn. MUSELLA. Siluesta, for this loue I can butt say You haue of meeâ That peece of hart which is nott giuen away Shalbee your owne; the rest will you obserue As fauor of tow harts, which tow will serue You euerâsoe true and constant loue, Your chastity ittself shall itt aproue. SILUESTA. I doe beleeue itt; for in soe much worth As liues in you, vertue must needs spring forth. And for Philisses, I loue him, and will In chastest seruice hinder still his ill. Then keepe your timeâalas! lett him nott dy For whom soe many sufferd misery. MUSELLA. Lett mee noe ioy receaue if I neglect This kind aduise, or him I soe respect. SILUESTA. Farewell, Musella!âloue and hapy bee. [Exit. MUSELLA. And bee thou blest that thus doth comfort mee! [Exit. PHILISSES. O, wreched man! and thou, all-conquering loue! Which showst thy pouer still on haples mee, Yett giue mee leaue in thes sweet shades to moue; Rest but to show my killing miserie; And bee once pleas'd to know my wrecched fate, And somthing pitty my ill and my state. Could euer Nature or the heauns e're frame Soe rare a partâso like themselues deuineâ And yett that work be blotted with the blame Of cruelty, and dark bee who should shine; To bee the brightest star of deerest prise, And yett to murder harts which to her cries Cry, and euen att the point of death, for care. Yett have I nothing left mee butt dispaire. Despaire! O, butt despaire, alas, hath hope! Noe better portion, nor a greater scope. Well, then, dispaire with my life coupled bee, And for my soddaine end doe soune agree. Ah mee, vnfortunate! would I could dy Butt soe soune as this company I fly! [Exit. DALINA-CLIMENA-SIMENA-FILLIS-DALINA. Now wee're alone, lett euery one confess Truly to other what our lucks haue binâ How often lik'd and lou'd; and soe express Our passions past. Shall wee this sport beegin? Non can accuse vs, non can vs betray, Vnles our selues our owne selues will bewray. FILLIS. I like this; butt will each one truly tell? CLIMENA. Trust mee, I will;âwho doth nott, doth nott well. SIMENA. I'le plainly speake; butt who shalbe the first? DALINA. I can say least of all, yett I will speake:â A sheapherd once ther wasâand nott the wurst Of these were most esteem'dâwhose sleepe did breake With loue, forsouthe, of mee: I found itt, thought I might haue him att leasure, lik'd him nott. Then was ther to our house a farmer brought, Rich and liuely; butt those bought nott his lott For loue. Tow folly youthes att last her came, Which both mee thought I very well could loue; When one was absent, t'other had the name; In my staid hart hee present did most moue. Both att a time in sight, I scarce could say Which of the tow I then would wish away; Butt they found how to chuse, and as I was Like changing, like vnsertaine, lett me pass. LISSIUS. I would nott this beeleeue, if other tongue Should this report, butt think itt had bin wrong; Butt since you speake this, could nott you agree To chuse some one, butt this vnchosen bee? DALINA. Truly, nott I. I plainly tell the truth, Yett doe confess 'twas folly in my youth, Which now I'le mend; the next that comes I'le haue; I will noe more bee foulish, nor delay, Since I do see the lads will labor saueâ One answere rids them, I'le noe more say nay; But if hee say, âDalina, will you love?â And âThank you,â I'le say, âif you will proue.ââ The next go on, and tell what you haue dunn. SIMENA. I am the next, and haue butt losses wunn; Butt yett I constant was, thoug still reiected. Lou'd, and nott lou'd, I was lik'd and neglected; Yett now some hope reuiues, when loue, thought dead, Cloth'd like the spring young bud when leaues ar fled. FILLIS. Your hap's the betterâwould mine were as good! Though I as long as you dispised stoodâ For I have lou'd, and lou'd butt only oneâ Yett I disdained could butt receaue that mone Which others doe for thousands,âso vniust Is Loue to those who in him most do trust! Nor did I euer lett my thoughts bee showne Butt to Musella, who all els hath knowne, Which wasâlong time I had Philises lou'd, And euer would, though hee did mee dispise; For then, allthough hee euer cruell prou'd, From him, nott mee, the fault must needs arise; And if Simena thus, your brother deere, Should bee vnkind, my loue shall still bee cleere. SIMENA. 'Tis well resolu'd; but how lik'd she your choyse? Did she or blame or els your mind commend? FILLIS. Niether she seem'd to dislike or reioice, Nor did commend I did this loue intend, Butt, smiling, said 'twere best to bee aduised: Comfort itt were to win, butt death dispisde. SIMENA. I doe beeleeve her. But Climena yett Hath nothing said: wee must nott her forgett. CLIMENA. Why, you haue said enough for you and mee; Yett, for your sakes I will the order keepe, Who, though I stranger heere by birthe I bee, And in Arcadia euer kept my sheepe, Yett heere itt is my fortune with the rest Of you to like, and, louing, bee oprest; For since I came I did a louer turne, And turne I did, indeed, when I lou'd heere, Since for another I in loue did burne, To whom I thought I had bin held as deere; Butt was deseau'd, when I for him had left My friends and country, was of him bereft And all, but that you kindly did imbrace And welcome mee into the hapy place, Wher, for your sakes, I ment to keep some sheep, Nott doubting euer to bee more deseau'd; Butt now, alas! I am anew beereau'd Of hart. Now time itt is myself to keepe, And lett flocks goe, vnles Simeana please To giue consent, and soe giue mee some ease. SIMENA. Why, what have I to do with whom you loue? CLIMENA. Beecause 'tis hee who doth your passion moue. SIMENA. He! les I fear the wining of his loue, Since all my faith could neuer so much moue; Yett can hee nott soe cruell euer bee, Butt hee may liue my miserie to see. CLIMENA. And when his eyes to loue shall open bee, I trust he will turne pitty vnto mee, And lett me haue reward which is my due. SIMENA. Which is your due! What pitty's due to you? Dreame you of hope? O, you to high aspire! Think you to gaine by kindling an old fire? CLIMENA. My loue wilbee the surer when I know, Nott loue alone, butt how loue to bestow. SIMENA. You make him yett, for all this, butt to bee The second in your loue; soe was nott hee In mine, butt first and lastâof all the chiefeâ That can to mee bring sorrow or reliefe. CLIMENA. This will nott winn him! You may taulke and hope, Butt in loue's passages ther is larg scope. SIMENA. 'Tis true; and you haue scope to chang and chuseâ To take and dislikeâlike, and soune refuse. CLIMENA. My loue as firme is to him as is thine. SIMENA. Yett mine did euer riseâneuer decline. Noe other mou'd in mee the flames of loue; Yett you dare hope as much as I to moue! Folly, indeed, is prou'dâand only vaine; And you his seruants feeds with hope of gaine. CLIMENA. I loue him most, Simena; I loue him best: can you Chaleng rewardâand can nott say you'r true? SIMENA. In this you wrong mee; faulce I haue nott binne, Butt chang'd on cause, Climena. Well, now, you hope to winn This secound; yett I, like those, lose noe time. Butt can you thinke that you can this way clime To your desires? This showes you loue haue tri'd, And that you can both chouse and choise deuide. Butt take your course, and win him if you can,â And I'le proseed in truth, as I began. DALINA. Fy! what a lyfe is heere about for loue! Neuer could itt in my hart thus much moue. This is the reason men ar growne soe coy, When they parseaue wee make their smiles our ioy. Lett them alone, and they will seeke and sue; Butt yeeld to them, they will with scorne poursue; Hold awhile of, they'll kneele, nay, follow you, And vowe and sweare, yett all their othes vntrue; Lett them once see you coming, then they fly; Butt strangly looke, and they'll for pitty cry. And let them cry!âther is noe euill dunn: They gaine butt that which you might els haue wunn. SIMENA. Is this your counsell? Why, butt now you said Your folly had your loues and good betraid; And that heerafter you would wiser bee Then to disdaine such as haue left you free. DALINA. 'Tis true that was the course I ment to take; Butt this must you doe your owne ends to make. I haue my fortunes lostâyours doe beginn, And to cross those could bee noe greater sinn. I know the world; and heare mee, this I aduiseâ Rather then to soune wunn, bee too presise. Nothing is lost by beeing carefull still, Nor nothing soe soune wun as louer's ill.â Heer Lissius comes: alas, hee is loue-strooke! Hee's euen now learning loue without the booke. LISSIUS. Loue, pardon mee! I know I did amiss When I thee scorn'd, or thought thy blame my bliss. I pitty meeâalas, I pitty craue! Doe nott sett trophies on my luckles graue. Though I, poore slaue and ignorant! did scorne Thy blesed name, lett nott my hart be torne With thus much torture. O, butt looke on mee! Take mee, a faithfull seruant, now to thee! CLIMENA. Deere Lissiusâmy deere Lissiusâfly mee nott! Lett nott both scorne and absence bee my lott. LISSIUS. Pray lett me goeâyou know I can nott loue; Doe nott thus farr my pasience striue to moue. CLIMENA. Why, cruell Lissius! wilt thou neuer mend, Butt still increase thy frounes for my sad end? LISSIUS. Climeana, 'tis enough that I haue saide; Bee gon and leaue mee! Is this for a maide To follow and to haunt mee thus? You blame Mee for disdaine, butt see nott your owne shame. Fy! I doe blush for you! A woman woo! The most vnfittest, shamfullst thing to doo. CLIMENA. Vnfitt and shamefull, I,âindeed 'tis true, Since sute is made to hard, relentles you. Well, I will leaue you and restore the wrong I suffer for my louing you too long; Noe more shall my words trouble you, nor I E're follow more, if nott to see mee dy. [Exit. LISSIUS. Farewell! you now doe right; this is the way To wine my wish; for when I all neglect That seek mee, she must needs something respect My loue the more. And what though she should say I once denide her, yett my true-felt paine Must needs from her soft brest some fauor gaine. DALINA. Lissius is taken! Well said, Cupid! Now You partly haue parform'd your taken vow. Of all our sheapheards, I nere thought that hee Would of thy foulish troupe a follower bee. Butt this itt is a goddess to dispise, And thwart a wayward boy who wants his eyes. Come, lett's nott trouble him: hee is distrest Enoughâhee neede nott bee with vs oprest. SIMENA. I'le stay, and aske him who 'tis hee doth loue. DALINA. Do nott a pensiue hart to passion moue. SIMENA. To passion! Would I could his passion find, To answere my distress'd and griued mind! DALINA. Stay, then, and try him, and your fortune try; Itt may bee hee loues you. Come, lett's goe by. LISSIUS. O, sweet Simena! looke butt on my paine! I grieue and curse myself for my disdaine; Now butt haue pittyâloue doth make me serue; And for your wrong and you I will reserue My lyfe to pay, your loue butt to deserue, And for your sake I doe my lyfe preserue. SIMENA. Preserue itt nott for mee; I seeke nott now, Nor can I creditt this, nor any vow Which you shall make. I was to long dispis'd To bee deseau'd; noe, I will bee aduis'd By my owne reason: loue shall noe more blind Mee, nor make mee beeleeue more then I find. LISSIUS. Beeleeue butt that, and I shall haue the end Of all my paine and wishes. I pretend A vertuous loue; then grant mee my desire, Who now doe wast in true and faithfull fire. SIMENA. How can I this beeleeue? Lissius, my faith shall tell That in true loue I will all els excell. Butt then, will you loue mee as I doe you? I promise may, for you can nott bee true. LISSIUS. Then you will promise breake, Simena, nott, if I find That as your words are, soe you'll make your mind. Lett mee nor speach nor mind haue, when that I In this or any els doe faulssefy My faith and loue to you. Simena, then, bee att rest, And of my true affection bee possest. Soe, deere Simeana, bee of mee and mine. Now doe my hopes and ioys together shine! SIMENA. Nor lett the least cloud rise to dim this light, Which loue makes to apeere with true delight. [Exit. VENUS-CUPID. Now haue thy torments long enough indur'd, And of thy force they are enough assur'd. O, hold thy hands! as I pitty now Thos whose great pride did whilum scorne to bow, Thou hast parform'd thy promise, and thy state Now is confest;âO, slacken, then, thy hate! They humble doe theyr harts and thoughts to thee: Beehold them, and accept them, and milde bee. Thy conquest is sufficient, saue the spoyles, And them only taken bee in toyles; Butt sett att liberty againe,âto tell Thy might and clemency, which doth excell. CUPID. I meane to saue them, butt some yett must try More paine ere they theyr blessings may come ny; Butt in the end all shall bee well againe, And sweetest is that loue obtain'd with paine. MUSIQUE. Loue! thy powerfull hand withdrawâ All doe yeeld vnto thy law. Rebells now thy subiects beeâ Bound they are who late were free; Most confess thy power and might, All harts yeeld vnto thy right. Thoughts directed ar by thee; Souls doe striue thy ioys to see. Pitty, then, and mercy giue Vnto them wher you doe liue; They your images doe proueâ In them you may see great loue; They your miroursâyou theyr eye, By which they true loue doe spy. Cease awhile theyr cruell smarts, And beehold theyr yeelding harts. Greater glory 'tis to saue When that you a conquest haue, Then with tiranny to press, Which still make the honor les. Gods doe prinses' hands directâ Then to thes haue some respect. CUPID. Now your part coms to play; In this you must somthing sway. Soe you shall, and I, your child, When you bid, can soone bee milde.</field>
