      <field name="fulltext">THE BOND-MAN: OR, Love and Liberty. A TRAGI-COMEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE BOOKSELLER TO THE READER. Philip Massanger, the Original Author of this Play, as Mr. Langbain gives us the Account, was born at Salisbury, Anno Dom. 1584. He was a Gentleman of University Education in Alban-Hall, Oxon. He was extreamly belov'd by all the Poets of that Age, which is sufficiently evident by several of the most eminent joining with him in their several Labours. He has publish'd 14 Plays entirely of his own Writing, (which, I have been inform'd, were revis'd by Mr. Rowe before his Death, and design'd by him for the Press) besides several others that he had a great Hand in. But this Play was reckon'd in his Life-Time to be the best of his Works. What Additions have been made since his Death, (if any one will give themselves the Trouble to read the Original) will, I hope, find they have done no Injury to his Memory. I only wonder such an excellent Play has escap'd being alter'd by some of our modern Poets. I don't doubt but the Reading and the Representation will be equally agreeable. I shall not say any Thing of the Gentleman's Abilities that took the Trouble to alter it; but this I am sure, he would not have taken the Pains, if the Goodness of the Play had not spoke for its self.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. Enter Timagoras and Leosthenes. Timag. Why should you droop, Leosthenes, or despair My Sister's Favour? What before you purchas'd By Courtship, and fair Language, in these Wars (For from her Soul you know she loves a Soldier) You may deserve by Action. Leost. If fair Cleora were confirm'd his Prize That has the strongest Arm, and sharpest Sword, I would court Bellona in her horrid Trim, As if she were a Mistress, and bless Fortune That offers my young Valour to the Proof, How much I dare do for your Sister's Love. But when I consider how much averse Your noble Father, Great Archidamus Is, and hath ever been to my Desires, Reason may warrant me to doubt and fear What Seeds soever I sow in these Wars Of noble Courage his determinate Will May blast, and give my Harvest to another, That never toil'd for it. Timag. Prithee do not nourish These jealous Thoughts; I am thine (and pardon me Though I repeat it) When the bold Theban su'd Far-fam'd Pisander, for my Sister's Love, Sent him disgrac'd and discontented Home. I wrote my Father then, and I that stopt not In the Career of my Affection to thee, When that renown'd Worthy, that brought with him High Birth, Wealth, Courage, as fee'd Advocates To mediate for him, never will consent A Fool, that only has the Shape of Man, Asotus, tho' he be rich Cleon's Heir, Shall bear her from thee. Leost. In that Trust I live. Timag. Which never shall deceive you. Enter Pisander. Pisan. Sir, the General Timoleon, by his Trumpets hath giv'n Warning For a Remove. Timag. 'Tis well: Provide my Horse. Pisan. I shall, Sir. [Exit Pisander. Leost. This Slave has a strange Aspect. Tim. Fit for his Fortune; 'tis a strong-limb'd Knave; My Father bought him for my Sister's Litter. O Pride of Women! Ladies think they keep not State enough, If for their Pomp and Ease, they are not borne In Triumph on Men's Shoulders. Leost. Who commands The Carthaginian Fleet? Timag. Gisco's their Admiral, And 'tis our Happiness, a raw young Fellow; One never train'd up in Arms, but rather fashion'd To tilt with Lady's Lips, than break a Lance: A Steel Helmet Made horrid with a glorious Plume, will crack His Woman's Neck. Leost. No more of him.âThe Motive's That Corinth gives us Aid? Timag. The common Danger, For Sicily being on Fire, she is not safe; It being apparent that ambitious Carthage, That to enlarge her Empire strives to fasten An unjust Gripe on us, (that live free Lords Of Syracusa) will not end, 'till Greece Acknowledge her their Sovereign. Leost. I am satisfy'd. What think you of our General? Timag. He is a Man Of strange and reserv'd Parts, but a great Soldier: [Trumpets flourish within. His Trumpets call us; I'll forbear his Character. To Morrow in the Senate House at large He will express himself. Leost. I'll follow you. Enter Cleon, Corisca, and Gracculo. Coris. Nay, good Chuck. Cleon. I have said it; stay at Home, I cannot brook your gadding; you're a fair one, Beauty invites Temptation, and short Heels Are soon tripp'd up. Coris. Deny me! By my Honour You take no Pity on me: I shall swoon As soon as you are absent; ask my Man else, You know he dares not tell a Lye. Cleon. O! you flatter me, I am old, And Wisdom cries beware. Coris. Old! Duck, to me You are young, Adonis. Grac. Well said, Venus, I am sure she Vulcans him. [Aside. Coris. I will not change thee For twenty boistrous young Things without Beards. Here's a round Belly, 'Tis a Down Pillow to my Back, I sleep So quietly by it. Grac. This is gross, Not find she flouts him? [Aside. Coris. As I live I am jealous. Cleon. Jealous! of me Wife? Coris. Yes, and I have a Reason, Knowing how lusty and active a Man you are. Cleon. Hum! hum! [Struts. Grac. This is no cunning Quean! 'slight, she will make him [Aside. To think, that like the Stag he has cast his Horns, And is grown young again. Coris. You have forgot what you did in your Sleep, And when you wak'd call'd for a Cawdle. Grac. 'Twas in his Sleep, For waking I durst trust my Mother with him. [Aside. Coris. I long to see this Man of War, Timoleon; Cleora, Archidamus's Daughter goes, And rich Olimpia; I will not miss the Show. Cleon. There's no contenting; For this Time I am pleas'd, but I'll no more on't. [Exeunt. Enter Archidamus, Cleon, Diphilus, Olympia, Corisca, Cleora, and Zanthia. Archid. So careless we have been, my noble Lords, In the disposing of our own Affairs, And ignorant in the Art of Government, That now we need a Stranger to instruct us: Yet we are happy, that our Neighbour Corinth (Pitying the unjust Gripe Carthage would lay On Syracusa) hath vouchsaf'd to lend us Her Man of Men, Timoleon, to defend Our Country and our Liberties. Diph. 'Tis a Favour We are unworthy of, and we may blush, Necessity compels us to receive it. Arch. O Shame! that we that are a populous Nation, Engag'd to liberal Nature for all Blessings An Island can bring forth; we that have Limbs, And able Bodies, Shipping, Arms, and Treasure, The Sinews of the War; now we are call'd To stand upon our Guard, cannot produce One fit to be our General. Cleon. I am old and fat, I could say something else. Archid. We must obey The Time, and our Occasions; ruinous Buildings, Whose Bases and Foundations are infirm, Must use Supporters: We are circl'd round With Danger, o're our Heads with Sail-stretch'd Wings Destruction hovers, and a cloud of Mischief Ready to break upon us; no Hope left us That may divert it, but our sleeping Vertue Rous'd up by brave Timoleon. Cleon. When arrives he? Diph. He is expected every Hour. Archid. The bravest Youth Of Syracusa, among whom my Son Timagoras, Leosthenes, and Asotas, (Your hopeful Heir, Lord Cleon) two Days since Rode forth to meet him, and attend him to The City; every Minute we expect To be bless'd with his Presence. [Shout at a Distance. Cleon. What Shout's this? [Trumpets flourish within. Diph. 'Tis seconded with loud Musick. Archid. Which confirms His wish'd-for Entrance. Let us entertain him With all Respect, Solemnity, and Pomp A Man may merit that comes to redeem us From Slavery and Oppression. Cleon. I'll lock up My Doors, and guard my Gold; these Lads of Corinth Have nimble Fingers, and I fear them more, Being within our Walls, than those of Carthage; They are far off. Archid. And, Ladies, be it your Care To welcome him and his Followers with all Duty: For rest resolv'd, their Hands and Swords must keep you In that full Height of Happiness you live; A dreadful Change else follows. [Ex. Arch. Cleo. Diph. Olimp. We are instructed. Coris. I'll kiss him, for the Honour of my Country, With any She in Corinth. Olimp. Were he a Courtier, I have Sweetmeat in my Closet should content him, Be his Pallat ne'er so curious. Coris. And if Need be, I have a Couch, and a Banquetting-house in my Garden, Where many a Man of Honour has not scorn'd To while away an Afternoon. Olimp. These Men of War, As I have heard, know not to court a Lady; They cannot praise our Dressings, kiss our Hands, Usher us to our Litters, tell Love Stories, Commend our Shape and Airs; They are rough, Boisterous and saucy, and at the first Sight Ruffle and towse us, and as they find their Stomachs Fall roundly to it. Coris. Troth, I like 'em the better; I cannot endure to have a perfum'd Sir Stand cringing in the Hams, licking his Lips Like a Spaniel over a hot Soup, and yet Has not the Boldness to come on, or offer What they know we expect. Olimp. We may commend A Gentleman's Modesty, Manners, and fine Language, His Singing, Dancing, riding of great Horses, The wearing of his Cloaths, his fair Complection, Take Presents from him, and extol his Bounty; Yet, tho' he observe, and waste his State upon us, If he be stanch, and bid not for the Stock That we were born to traffick with; the Truth is, We care not for his Company. Coris. Musing, Cleora? Ol. She's studying how to entertain these Strangers, And to engross them to herself. Cleora. No, surely, I will not cheapen any of their Wares, 'Till you have made your Market; you will buy I know at any Rate. Coris. She has given it you. [Flourish of Trumpets Olimp. No more, they come: The first Kiss for this Jewel. Enter Timagoras, Leosthenes, Asotus, Archidamus, Diphilus, and Cleon, Two by Two; then Timoleon with his General's Staff, follow'd by Pisander, Gracculo, Cimbrio, with other Slaves. Archid. This Seat is yours. Diph. Which with a general Suffrage As to the supreme Magistrates surely tenders, And prays Timoleon to accept. Timol. Such Honours To one ambitious of Rule or Titles, Whose Heaven on Earth is plac'd in his Command, And absolute Power on others, would with Joy, And Veins swoln high with Pride, be entertain'd. They take not me; for I have ever lov'd An equal Freedom, and proclaim'd all such As would usurp anothers Liberties, Rebels to Nature, to whose bounteous Blessings All Men lay Claim as true legitimate Sons. But such as have made Forfeit of themselves By vicious Courses, and their Birth right lost, 'Tis not Injustice they are mark'd for Slaves To serve the Vertuous: For my self, I know Honours and great Employments are great Burdens, And must require an Atlas to support them. He that would govern others, first should be The Master of himself, richly endu'd With Depth of Understanding, Height of Courage, And those remarkable Graces which I dare not Ascribe unto my self. Archid. Sir, empty Men Are Trumpets of their own Deserts; but you That are not in Opinion, but in Proof Really good, and full of glorious Parts, Leave the Report of what you are to Fame; Which, from the ready Tongues of all good Men, Aloud proclaims you. Diph. Besides, you stand bound, Having so large a Field to exercise Your active Vertues offer'd you, to impart Your Strength to such as need it. Timol. 'Tis confess'd. And since you'll have it so, such as I am, For you and for the Liberty of Greece I am most ready to lay down my Life: But yet consider, Men of Syracusa, E're that you deliver up the Power, Which yet is yours, to me, to whom 'tis given To an impartial Man, with whom nor Threats, Nor Prayers shall e're prevail; for I must steer An even Course. Archid. Which is desir'd of all. Ascend, Great Timoleon. Timol. Stay yet; and ere I take This Seat of Justice, or engage my self To fight for you Abroad, or to reform Your State at Home, swear all upon my Sword, And call the Gods of Sicily to witness The Oath you take; that whatsoe'er I shall Propound for Safety of your Commonwealth, Not circumscrib'd, or bound in, shall by you Be willingly obey'd. Archid. Diph. Cleon. So may we prosper, As we obey in all Things. Timag. Leost. Asot. And observe All your Commands as Oracles. Timol. Do not repent it. [Ascends the Throne. Olimp. He ask'd not our Consent. Coris. He's a Clown I warrant him. Olimp. I offer'd my self twice, and yet the Churl Would not salute me. Coris. Let him kiss his Drum; I'll save my Lips, I rest on it. Olimp. He thinks Women No Part of the Republick. Coris. He shall find We are a Commonwealth. Cleora. The less your Honour. Timol. First then a Word or two, but without Bitness, (And yet mistake me not, I am no Flatterer) Concerning your ill Government of the State: In which the greatest, noblest, and most rich Stand, in the first File, guilty. Cleon. Ha! how's this? Timol. You have not studied, as good Patriots should, The publick Good, but your particular Ends: Factious among your selves, preferring such To Offices and Honours, as ne'er read The Elements of saving Policy; But deeply skill'd in all the Principles That usher to Destruction. Leost. Sharp. Timag. The better. Timol. Your Senate House, which used not to admit A Man (however popular) to stand At the Helm of Government; whose Youth was not Made glorious by Action; whose Experience, Crown'd with grey Hairs, gave Warrant to her Counsel's Hand, and receiv'd with Rev'rence, is not fill'd With green Heads, that determine of the State Over their Cups, or when their sated Lusts Afford them Leisure; or supply'd by those Who rising from base Arts and sordid Thrift, Are eminent for their Wealth, and not for Wisdom; Which is the Reason, that to hold a Place In Council, which was once esteem'd an Honour, And a Reward for Vertue, hath quite lost Lustre and Reputation, and is made A mercenary Purchase. Timag. He speaks Home. Leost. And to the Purpose. Timol. From whence it follows, That the Treasure of the City is engross'd By a few private Men; the publick Coffers Hollow with Want; and they that will not spare One Talent for the common Good, to feed The Pride and Bravery of their Wives, consume In Plate, in Jewels, and superfluous Slaves, What would maintain an Army. Coris. Have at us. Olimp. We thought we were forgot. Cleora. But it appears You will be treated of. Timol. Yet in this Plenty, And fat of Peace, your young Men ne'er were train'd In martial Discipline, and your Ships, unrigg'd, Rot in the Harbour, no Defence prepar'd, But thought unuseful; as if the Gods, Indulgent to your Sloth, had granted you A Perpetuity of Pride and Pleasure; No Change fear'd or expected. Now you find That Carthage, looking on your stupid Sleeps And dull Security, was invited to Invade your Territories. Archid. You have made us see, Sir, To our Shame, the Country's Sickness: Now from you, As from a careful and a wise Physician, We do expect the Cure. Timol. Old fester'd Sores Must be lanc'd to the quick and cauteriz'd; Which born with Patience, after I'll apply Soft Unguents. For the Maintenance of the War It is decreed, all Monies in the Hand Of private Men shall instantly be brought To the publick Treasury. Timag. This bites sore. Cleon. The Cure Is worse than the Disease; I'll never yield to it. What could the Enemy, tho' Victorious, Inflict more on us? All that my Youth hath toil'd for, Purchas'd with Industry, and preserv'd with Care, Forc'd from me in a Moment. Diph. This rough Course Will never be allow'd of. Timol. Oh! blind Men! If you refuse the first Means that is offer'd To give your Wealth, no Hopes left to recover Your desp'rate Sickness Do you prize your Dirt Above your Liberties? And rather choose To be made Bond-men, than to part with that To which already you are Slaves. But take your own Ways; hoard up your Gold, Sacrifice to your Idol, and preserve The Prey entire, and merit the Report Of careful Stewards; yield a just Account To your proud Masters, who with Whips of Iron Will force you to give up what you conceal, Or tear it from your Throats: Adorn your Walls With Persian Hangings wrought of Gold and Pearl; Cover the Floors on which they are to tread With costly Median Silks; perfume the Rooms With Cassia and Amber, where they are To feast and revel; while, like servile Grooms, You wait upon their Trenchers. Set forth your Wives And Daughters in as many vary'd Shapes As there are Nations, to provoke their Lusts, And let them be embrac'd before your Eyes: The Object may content you; and to perfect The Entertainment, offer up your Sons And able Men for Slaves; while you, that are Unfit for Labour, are spurn'd out to starve, Unpity'd, in some Desart; no Friend by, Whose Sorrow may spare one compassionate Tear In the Remembrance of what once you were. Leost. The Blood turns. Timag. Observe how old Cleon shakes, As if in Picture he had shewn him what He was to suffer. Coris. I am sick; the Man Speaks Ponyards and Diseases. Olimp. Oh! my Doctor, I never shall recover. Cleora. If a Virgin, Whose Speech was ever yet usher'd with Fear; One knowing Modesty and humble Silence To be the choicest Ornaments of our Sex; In the Presence of so many Rev'rend Men, Struck dumb with Terror and Astonishment, Presume to cloath her Thought in vocal Sounds, Let her find Pardon: First, to you, Great Sir, A bathful Maid's Thanks, and her zealous Prayers, Wing'd with pure Innocence, hearing 'em to Heav'n For all Prosperity that the Gods can give To one whose Piety must exact their Care; Thus low I offer. Timol. 'Tis a happen Omen; Rise, fair One, and speak boldly: On my Vertue I am thy Warrant; from so clear a Spring Sweet Rivers ever flow. Cleora. Then thus to you, My noble Father, and these Lords, to whom I next owe Duty; no Respect forgotten To you my Brother, and these bold young Men, (Such I would have them) that are, or should be The City's Sword and Target of Defence. To all of you I speak; and if a Blush Steal on my Cheeks, it is shown to reprove Your Paleness, willingly I would not say Your Cowardice, or Fear: Think you all Treasure Hid in the Bowels of the Earth, or Shipwreck'd In Neptune's watry Kingdom, can hold Weight, When Liberty and Honour fill one Scale, Triumphant Justice sitting on the Beam? Or dare you but imagine that your Gold is Too dear a Salary for such as hazard Their Blood and Lives in your Defence? For me, An ignorant Wretch, bear Witness, Heav'n, so far I prize a Soldier, that to give him Pay, With such Devotion as our Flamens offer Their Sacrifices at the holy Altar, I do lay down these Jewels; will make Sale Of my superfluous Wardrobe to supply The meanest of their Wants. Timol. Brave, masculine Spirit! Diph. We are shewn to our Shame what we in Honour Should have taught others. Archid. Such a fair Example Must needs be followed. Timag. Ever, my dear Sister, But now our House's Glory. Leost. Were she deform'd, The Vertue of her Mind would force a Stoick To sue to be her Servant. Cleon. I must yield, And tho' my Heart Blood part with it, I will Deliver in my Wealth. Asot. I would say something; But the Truth is, I know not what. Timol. We have Money, And Men must now be thought on. Archid. We can press Of Labourers in the Country (Men inur'd To Cold and Heat) ten Thousand. Diph. Or, if Need be, Inrol of Slaves, lusty and able Varlets, And fit for Service. Cleon. They shall go for me, I will not pay and fight too. Cleora. How! your Slaves? O Stain of Honour! once more, Sir, your Pardon; And to their Shames let me deliver what I know in Justice you may speak. Timol. Most gladly: I could not wish my Thoughts a better Organ Than your Tongue to express them. Cleora. Are you Men? (For Age may qualify, tho' not excuse The Backwardness of these) able young Men? Yet now your Country's Liberty's at Stake; Honour, and glorious Triumph made the Garland For such as dare deserve them: A rich Feast, Prepar'd by Victory of immortal Viands; Not for base Men, but such as with their Swords Dare force Admittance, and will be her Guests: And can you coldly suffer such Rewards To be propos'd to Labourers and Slaves? While you that are born Noble, cry, Ah! me! Like idle Lookers on, 'till their proud Worth Make them become your Masters? Timol. By my Hopes, There's Fire enough in this to make Thersites Valiant. Cleora. No! far, far be it from you; Let those of meaner Quality contend Who can indure most Labour; plow the Earth, And think they are rewarded, when their Sweat Brings Home a fruitful Harvest to their Lords: Let them prove good Artificers, and serve you For Use and Ornament; but not presume To touch at what is Noble, if you think them Unworthy to taste of those Cates you feed on, Or wear such costly Garments. Will you grant them The Priviledge and Prerogative of great Minds, Which you were born to? Honour won in War, And to be styl'd Preservers of their Country, Are Titles fit for free and gen'rous Spirits, And not for Bond-men. Had I been born a Man, And such ne'er dying Glories made the Prize To bold heroick Courage, by Diana I would not to my Brother, nay, my Father, Be brib'd to part with the least Spark of Honour I should purchase in this Action. Timol. She's inspir'd, Or in her speaks the Genius of your Country, To fire your Blood in her Defence: I am wrapp'd With the Imagination. Noble Maid, Timoleon is your Soldier, and will sweat Drops of his best Blood, but he will bring Home Triumphant Conquest to you; And though youthful Heats, That look no farther than your outward Form, Are long since buried in me, while I live I am a constant Lover of your Mind, That does transcend all Precedents. Cleora. 'Tis an Honour, And so I do receive it. Coris. Pox upon it: She has got the Start of us: I cou'd ev'n burst With Envy at her Fortune. Olimp. A raw young Thing: We have too much Tongue sometimes our Husbands say, And she out-strips us. Leost. I am for the Journey. Timag. May all Diseases Sloth and Lewdness bring, Fall upon him that stays at Home. Archid. Though old, I will be there in Person. Diph. So will I. Methinks I am not what I was; her Words Have made me younger by a Score of Years, Than I was when I came hither. Cleon. I am still Old Cleon, fat and unweildy; I shall never Make a good Soldier, and therefore desire To be excus'd at Home. Asot. 'Tis my Suit too: I am but a Gristle, and these Spider Fingers Will never hold a Sword.âLet us alone To rule the Slaves at Home; I can so yerk 'em: But in my Conscience I shall never frighten Any Body in the War. Timol. Have your Desiresâ You would be Burdens to us, no Way Aids. Lead, Fairest, to the Temple; first we'll pay A Sacrifice to the Gods, to implore Success: For all great Actions the wish'd Course do run, That are, with their Allowance, well begun. Exeunt all but the Slaves. Pisan. Stay, Cimbrio and Gracculo. Cimb. The Business? Pisan. Meet me to Morrow Night near to the Grove, Neighbouring the East Part of the City. Grac. Well. Pisan. And bring the rest of our Condition with you, I've something to impart may break our Fetters, If you dare second me. Cimb. We'll not fail. Grac. A Cart-rope Shall not bind me at Home. Pisand. Think on't, and prosper. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Scene I. Enter Archidamus, Timagoras, Leosthenes, and Pisander with Archidamus's Sword, &amp;c. Archid. So, so, 'tis well: How do I look? Pisan. Most sprightly, Sir. Archid. I shrink not in the Shoulders, tho' I am old; I am tough, Steel to the Back; I have not wasted My Stock of Strength in Feather-Beds: Here's an Arm too, There's Stuff in't, and I hope will use a Sword As well as any beardless Boy of you all. Timag. I am glad to see you, Sir, so well prepar'd To endure the Travail of the War. Archid. Go to, Sirrah, I shall endure, when some of you keep your Cabins, For all your flanting Feathersânay, Leosthenes, You are welcome too; all Friends and Fellows now. Leost. Your Servant, Sir. Archid. Pish, leave these Complements, They stink in a Soldier's Mouth, I could be merry, For now my Gown's off, farewel Gravity. I must be bold to put a Question to you, Without Offence, I hope. Leost. Sir, what you please. Archid. And you will answer truly? Timag. On our Words, Sir. Archid. Go to, then, I presume you will confess, That you are two notorious Whore-masters Nay, spare your blushing, I've been wild myself, A Smatch, or so, for Physick, does no Harm: Nay, it is Physick, if us'd moderately, But to lie at Rack and Manger. Leost. Say we should grant this, (For if we should deny it, you'l not believe us,) What will you infer from it? Archid. What you'l groan for, I fear, when you come to the Test. Old Stories tell us There is a Month call'd October, which brings in Cold Weather; there are Trenches too, 'tis rumour'd, In which, to stand all Night to the Knees in Water, In Gallants breeds the Tooth-ach; there's a Sport too, Nam'd, Lying Perdieu, (do you mark me?) 'tis a Game, Which you must learn to play at; now in these Seasons, (And choice Variety of Exercises) Your rambling Hunt-smock feels strange Alterations, And in a frosty Morning looks as if He could with Ease creep in a Pottle-pot Instead of his Mistress's Placketâthen he curses The Time spent in Midnight Visitations, And finds, what he superfluously parted with, If retriev'd into his Back again, Would keep him warmer than a Scarlet Wastecoat, Or an Armour lin'd with Furr. Enter Diphilus and Cleora. O welcome, welcome! You have cut off my Discourses, but I will perfect My Lecture in the Camp. Diph. Come, we are stay'd for; The General's on Fire for a Remove, And longs to be in Action. Archid. 'Tis my Wish too. We must part. Nay, no Tears, my best Cleora; I shall melt too, and that were ominous: Millions of Blessings on thee; all that's mine I give up to thy Charge; and, Sirrah, look You with that Care and Reverence observe her, As you would pay to me;âOne Kiss, farewel, Girl! Come, to the Wars, Gentlemen. Diph. Peace wait upon you, fair one. [Ex. Archid. Diph. and Pisander. Timag. 'Twere Impertinence To wish you to be careful of your Honour, That ever keep in Pay a Guard about you Of faithful VertuesâFarewel, Friend, I leave you To wipe our Kisses off: I know that Lovers Part with more Circumstance and Ceremony, Which I give Way to. [Exit Timag. Leost. 'Tis a noble Favour, For which I ever owe youâWe are alone, But how I should begin, or in what Language Speak the unwilling Word of parting from you, I am yet to learn. Cleora, And still continue ignorant; For I must be most cruel to my self, If I should teach you. Leost. Shall I stay at Home then? Cleora, No, that must not be; For so to serve my own Ends, and to gain A petty Wreath myself, I rob you of A certain Triumph, which must fall upon you. Or Vertue's turn'd a Handmaid to blind Fortune: How is my Soul divided! to confirm you In the Opinion of the World, most worthy To be belov'd: With me you are at the Height, And can advance no farther; I must send you To court the Goddess of stern War, who, if She see you with my Eyes, will ne'er return you, But grow enamour'd of you. Leost. Sweet, take Comfort, And what I offer you, you must vouchsafe me, Or I am wretched; all the Dangers that I can encounter in the War, are Trifles; My Enemies abroad to be contemn'd; The dreadful Foes that have Pow'r to hurt me, I leave at Home with you. Cleor. With me? Leost. Nay, in you, In every Part of you they are arm'd To sight against me. Cleor. Where? Leost. There's no Perfection That you are Mistress of, but musters up A Legion against me, and all sworn To my Destruction. Cleor. This is strange! Leost. But true, Sweet: Excess of Love can work such Miracles. Upon this Ivory Forehead are intrench'd Ten thousand Rivals; and should I but name Such as the Virtues of your Mind invite, Their Numbers would be infinite. Cleor. Can you think I may be tempted? Leost. You were never prov'd. For me, I have convers'd with you no farther Than would become a Brother. I ne'er tun'd Loose Notes to your chaste Ears; or brought rich Presents, For my Artillery to batter down The Fortress of your Honour; never practis'd The cunning and corrupting Arts they study, That wander in the Maze of wild Desire: Honest Simplicity and Truth were all The Agents I employ'd; and when I came To see you, it was with that Reverence As I beheld the Altars of the Gods. Cleor. And 'twas That Modesty that took me, and preserves me, Like a fresh Rose in my own nat'ral Sweetness; Which, sully'd with the Touch of impure Hands, Had made me lose both Scent and Beauty. Leost. But, Cleora, When I am absent, as I must go from you, (Such is my cruel Fate) and leave you, Unguarded to the violent Assaults Of loose Temptations; when the Memory Of my so many Years of Love and Service Is lost in other Objects; when you are courted By such as keep a Catalogue of their Conquests. Won upon credulous Virgins: When nor Father Is here to awe you, Brother to advise you, Nor your poor Servant by, to keep such off, By Love instructed how to undermine, And blow your Chastity up; when your weak Senses, At once assaulted, shall conspire against you, How can you stand? Faith, tho' you fall, and I The Judge, before whom you then stood accus'd, I should acquit you. Cleor. Come, 'tis not well: But being to part, I will not chide, I will not, Not with one Syllable, or Tear, express How deeply I am wounded with the Arrows Of your Distrust: But when that you shall hear At your Return, how I have borne myself, And what an austere Penance I take on me, To satisfy your Doubts: When, like a Vestal, I shew you, to your Shame, the Fire still burning, Committed to my Charge by true Affection, The People joining with you in the Wonder: When, by the glorious Splendor of my Suff'rings, The prying Eyes of Jealousy are struck blind, The Monster too, that feeds on Fear, ev'n starv'd For want of seeming Matter to accuse me, Expect, Leosthenes, a sharp Reproof From my just Anger. Leost. What will you do? Cleor. Obey me in what I do now enjoin, Or from this Minute you're a Stranger to me; And do it without Reply: All-seeing Sun, Thou Witness of my Innocence, thus I close My Eyes against thy comfortable Light, 'Till the Return of this distrustful Man. Now bind 'em sureânay, do't. [Binds her Eyes. If uncompell'd I loose this Knot, until the Hands that made it, Be pleas'd to untie it, may all the dire Calamities, Due to the Crime of Perjury, fall heavy on me. Now guide me to your Lipsâ This Kiss, when you come back, shall be a Virgin, To bid you Welcome: Nay, this is not all my Vow, I will continue dumb, and you once gone, No Accent shall come from me. Now to my Chamber; My Tomb, if you miscarry: There I'll spend My Hours in silent Mourning, and thus much Shall be reported of me to my Glory, And you confess it too, let me live or die, My Truth shall triumph o'er your Jealousy. [Exeunt. Enter Asotus, driving in Gracculo. Asot. You Slave! you Dog! down, Cur. Grac. Hold, good young Master, For Pity's Sake. Asot. Now am I in my Kingdom. Who says I am not valiant? I begin To frown again; quake, you Dog! orâ Grac. So I do, Sir; Your Looks are Agues to me. Asot. Are they so, Sir, 'Slight, if I had them at this Bay, that flout me, And say I look like a Sheep and an Ass, I'd make 'em Feelâthat I am a Lion. Grac. Do not roar, Sir, As you are a valiant BeastâBut do you know Why you use me thus? Asot. I'll beat thee a little more, Then study for a ReasonâO! I have it; One brake a Jest on me, and then I swore, (Because I durst not strike him) when Home I came, That I would break thy Head. Grac. Pox on his Mirth, I am sure I mourn for't. Asot. Remember too, I charge you To teach my Horse good Manners; for this Morning, As I rode to take the Air, th'untutor'd Jade Threw me, and kick'd me. Grac. I thank him for't. Asot. What's that? Grac. I say, Sir, I'll teach him to hold his Heels, If you will hold your Fingers. Asot. I'll think upon't. Grac. I am bruis'd to JellyâBetter be a Dog, Than a Slave to a Fool or Coward. Asot. Here's my Mother. Enter Corisca and Zanthia. She is chastising tooâHow brave we live That have our Slaves to beat, to keep us in Breath, When we want Exercise? Coris. Careless Harlotry, [Striking her, Look to't, if a Curl fall, or Wind, or Sun Take my Complexion off, I will not leave One Hair upon thy Head. Grac. Here's a second Show Of the Family of Pride. Corisc. Fie on these Wars, I am starv'd for want of Action; not a Gamester left To keep a Woman play: They have made my Doctor too Physician to the Army: He was us'd To serve the Turn at a Pinch; but I am now Quite unprovided. Asot. My Mother-in-Law is sure At her Devotion. [Aside.] Coris. There are none but our Slaves left; Nor are they to be trusted.âSome great Women (Which I could name) in a Dearth of Visitants, Rather than be idle, have been glad to play At small Game; but I am so squeasy stomach'd, And from my Youth have been so us'd to Dainties, I cannot taste such gross Meat. Asot. Fair Madam, and my Mother. Coris. Leave the last out; it smells rank of the Country, And shews course Breeding: Your true Courtier knows not His Niece or Sister from another Woman, If she be apt and cunning.âI could tempt now This Fool; but he will be so long a working: Then he's my Husband's Son: The fitter to Supply his Wants, I have the Way already: I'll try if it will take.âWhen were you with Your Mistress, fair Cleora. Asot. Two Days since; But she's so coy, forsooth, that ere I can Speak a penn'd Speech I have bought and study'd for her, Her Woman calls her away. Coris. Here's a dull Thing; But better taught I hope.âSend off your Man. Asot. Sirrah, be gone. Grac. This is the first good Turn She ever did me. [Aside.] Exit Gracculo. Coris. We'll have a Scene of Mirth; I must not have you sham'd for want of Practice: I stand here for Cleora, and do you hear Minion, (That you may tell her what her Woman should do) Repeat the Lesson over that I taught you When my young Lord came to visit me; if you miss In a Syllable or Posture!â Zant. I am perfect. Asot. Would I were so; I fear I shall be out. Coris. If you are, I'll help you in: Thus I walk musing. You are to enter; and as you pass by, Salute my Woman:âBe but bold enough, You'll speed I warrant you; begin. Asot. Have at itâ 'Save thee, SweetheartâA Kiss. Zant. Venus forbid, Sir, I should presume to taste your Honour's Lips Before my Lady. Coris. This is well on both Parts. Asot. How does thy Lady? Zant. Happy in your Lordship, As often as she thinks on you. Coris. Very good; This Wench will learn in Time. Asot. Does she think of me? Zant. O Sir! and speaks the best of you; admires Your Wit, your Cloaths, Discourse; and swears, but that You are not forward enough for a Lord, you were The most compleat and absolute Man:âI'll shew Your Lordship a Secret. Asot. What, of thy own? Zant. Oh! no, Sir; Tis of my Lady; but upon your Honour You must conceal it. Asot. By all Means.â Zant. Sometimes I lie with my Lady, as the last Night I did: She could not say her Pray'rs for thinking of you; Nay, she talk'd of you in her Sleep, and sigh'd out, O sweet Asotus, sure thou art so backward, That I must ravish thee. And in that Fervour She took me in her Arms, Kiss'd me, and hugg'd me, and then wak'd, and wept, Because 'twas but a Dream. Coris. This will bring him on, Or he's a Block.âA good Girl! Asot. I am mad 'Till I am at it. Zant. Be not put off, Sir, With Away, I dare not; Fie, you are immodest: My Brother's up; My Father will hearâShoot Home, Sir, you cannot miss the Mark. Asot. There's for thy Counsel: [Gives her Money. This is the fairest Interlude; if it prove earnest, I shall wish I were a Player. Coris. Now my Turn comes.â I am exceeding sick; pray you, send my Page For young Asotus; I cannot live without him: Pray him to visit me; yet when he's present I must be strange to him. Asot. Not so; you, are caught: Lo! whom you wish behold Asotus here! Coris. You wait well, Minion; shortly I shall not speak My Thoughts in my private Chamber, but they must Lie open to Discovery. Asot. 'Slid she's angry. Zant. No, no, Sir; she but seems so.âTo her again. Asot. Lady, I would descend to kiss your Hand, But that 'tis glov'd, and Civet makes me sick; And to presume to taste your Lips, not safe, Your Woman by. Coris. She's no Observer Of whom I grace. [Zant. goes to the Table and seems to read. Asot. She's at her Book, O rare! [Kisses her. Coris. A Kiss for Entertainment is sufficient: Too much of one Dish cloys me. Asot. I would serve in The second Course; but still I fear your Woman. Coris. You are very cautious. [Zant. seems to sleep. Asot. 'Slight, she's asleep! 'Tis Pity these Instructions are not printed; They would sell well to Chamber-Maids.â'Tis no Time now To play with my good Fortune and your Favour; Yet to be taken, as they say.âA Scout To give the Signal when the Enemy comes [Zanthia rises up hastily and goes out. Were now worth Gold.âShe's gone to watch.â A Waiter so train'd up were worth a Million To a wanton City Lady. Coris. You are grown conceited. Asot. You teach me.âLady, now to your Chamber. Coris. You speak as it were yours. Asot. When we are there, I'll show you my best Evidence. Coris. Hold! you forget; I only play Cleora's Part. Asot. No matter; Now we have begun, let's end the Act. Coris. Forbear, Sir! Your Father's Wife? Asot. Why, being Heir, I am bound, Since he can make no Satisfaction to you, To see his Debts paid? Enter Zanthia running. Zant. Madam, my Lord! Coris. Fall off; I must trifle with the Time too! Asot. Pox on his toothless Chaps! He cannot do't Himself, yet hinders such as have good Stomachs. Enter Cleon. Cleon. Where are you, Wife? I fain would go Abroad, But cannot find my Slaves that bear my Litter: I am tir'd: Your Shoulder, Son; nay, Sweet, thy Hand too; A Turn or too in the Garden, and then to Supper, And so to Bed. Asot. Never to rise more, I hope. [Exeunt. SCENE draws, and discovers Pisander, Poliphron, Cimbrio, Gracculo, and other Slaves at a Table, drinking. Pisand. 'Twill take, I warrant thee. Polip. You may do your Pleasure; But, in my Judgment, better to make Use of The present Opportunity. Pisand. No more. Polip. I am silenc'd. Pisand. More Wine: Come! let's have a Song to cheer our Hearts. [A Song. 'Pray thee drink hard, Friend, And when we are hot, whatever I propound, Second with Vehemency: Slaves use no Ceremony; sit down, here's a Health. Polip. Let it go round; fill every Man his Glass. Grac. We look for no Waiters; this is Wine. Pisand. The better, strong lusty Wine; Drink deep: This Juice will make us As free as our Lords. [drinks. Grac. But if they find we taste it, We are all damn'd to the Quarry during Life, Without Hope of Redemption. Pisan. Pish! for that We'll talk anon; another Rouse, we lose Time. [drinks. These Glasses contain nothing; [Takes the Bottle. Do me right As e're you hope for Liberty. [All drink. 'Tis bravely done, How do you feel your selves now? Cimb. I begin To have strange Conundrums in my Head. Grac. And I to loath base Water: I would be hang'd in Peace now For one Month of such Holy-days. Pisand. An Age, Boys, And yet defy the Whip; if you are Men, Or dare believe you have Souls. Cimb. We are no Brokers. Grac. Nor Whores, whose Marks are out of their Mouths: They hardly can get Salt enough to keep 'em From stinking above Ground. Pisand. Our Masters are no Gods? Grac. They are Devils to us, I am sure. Pisand. But subject to Cold, Hunger, and Diseases. Grac. In abundance: Your Lord, that feels no Ach in his Chine at Twenty, Forfeits his Privilege; how should their Surgeon build else, Or ride in their own Coaches. Pisand. Equal Nature fashion'd us All in one Mold: The Bear serves not the Bear, Nor the Wolf the Wolf: Why then (since we are taught by their Examples To love our Liberty) Should the Strong serve the Weak, Or such as know the Cause of Things, pay Tribute To ignorant Fools? All's but the outward Gloss And Politick Form that does distinguish us. Cymbrio, thou art a strong Man; if in Place Of carrying Burdens, thou hadst been train'd up In Martial Discipline, thou might'st have prov'd A General, fit to lead and fight for Sicily, As fortunate as Timoleon. Cimb. A little Fighting Will serve a General's Turn. Pisand. Thou, Gracculo, Hast Fluency of Language, quick Conceit; And I think, cover'd with a Senator's Robe, Formally set on the Bench, thou would'st appear As brave a Senator. Grac. Would I had Lands, Or Money to buy a Place; and if I did not Sleep on the Bench with the drowsiest of 'em, Play with my Chain, Look on the Clock when my Guts chim'd Twelve, And rank with 'em In their most choice peculiar Gifts, degrade me, And put me to drink Water again, which (now I have tasted Wine) were Poison. Pisand. 'Tis nobly spoke, And like a Gown-manâNone of these, I think too, But would prove good Burghers. Grac. Hum! The Fools are modest; I know their Insides.âHere's an ill-fac'd Fellow, (But that will not be seen in a dark Shop) If he did not in a Month learn to out-swear, In the selling of his Wares, the cunning'st Tradesman In Syracusa, I have no Skill.âHere's another, Observe but what a cos'ning Look he has, (Hold up thy Head, Man) if for drawing Gallants Into Mortgages for Commodities, cheating Heirs, He does not transcend all that went before him, Call in his Patent. Pisand. Is't not Pity then, Men of such eminent Vertues should be Slaves? Cimb. 'Tis our hard Fortune! Pisand. 'Tis your Folly.âDaring Men Command, and make their Fates.âSay, at this Instant I mark'd you out a Way to Liberty; Possess'd you of those Blessings our proud Lords So long have surfeited in; and, what is sweetest, Arm you with Pow'r, by strong Hand t'avenge Your Stripes; your unregarded Toil, the Pride, The Insolence of such as tread upon Your patient Suff'ring; fill your famish'd Mouths With the Fat and Plenty of the Land; redeem you From the dark Vale of Servitude, and seat you Upon a Hill of Happiness: What would you do To purchase this, and more? Grac. Do any Thing, To burn a Church or two, and dance by the Light on't, Were but a May-game. Poliph. I have a Father living, But if the Cutting of his Throat could work this, He should excuse me, Cimb. 'Slife, I would cut my own Rather than miss it, so I might but have A Taste on't e're I die. Pisan. Be resolute Men; You shall run no such Hazard, nor groan under The Burden of such crying Sins. Cimb. The Means? Grac. I feel a Woman's Longing. Polip. Do not torment us With Expectation. Pisan. Thus then; Our proud Masters, And all the able Freemen of the City Are gone unto the Wars. Poliph. Observe but that! Pisan. Old Men, and such as can make no Resistance, Are only left at Home. Grac. And the proud young Fool My Master.âIf this take, I'll hamper him. Pisan. Their Arsenal, their Treasure's in our Pow'r, If we have Hearts to seize 'em; if our Lords fall In the present Action, the whole Country's ours. Say they return victorious, we have Means To keep the Town against them; at the worst, To make our own Conditions. Now, if you dare, Fall on their Daughters and their Wives, break up Their Iron Chests, banquet on their rich Beds, And carve your selves of all Delights and Pleasures You have been barr'd from: With one Voice cry with me, Liberty, Liberty! All. Liberty, Liberty! Pisan Be firm and follow me, and take Possession: Use all Freedom, but shed no Blood.â So, this is well begun, But not to be applauded till't be done. [Exeunt omnes, crying, Liberty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. Scene I. Enter Pisander and Timandra. Pisan. Why think you that I plot against my self? Fear nothing; you are safe; these thick-skinn'd Slaves (I use as Instruments to serve my Ends) Pierce not my deep Designs; nor shall they dare To lift an Arm against you. Timan. Not with your Will, I grant you: But turbulent Spirits rais'd beyond themselves With Ease, are not so soon laid; they oft prove Dangerous to him that call'd them up. Pisan. 'Tis true, In what is rashly undertook. Long since I have consider'd seriously their Natures, Proceeded with mature Advice, and know, I hold their Will and Faculties in more Awe Than I can do my own. However, I'm resolv'd; And Sleep you with Security. Holds Cleora Constant to her rash Vow? Timan. Beyond Belief! To me, that see her hourly, it seems a Fable. She eats little, Sleeps less, as I imagine; once a Day I lead her to this Gallery, where she walks Some half a dozen Turns; and having offer'd To her absent Saint a Sacrifice of Sighs, She points back to her Prison. Pisan. Guide her hither, And make her understand the Slaves revolt; And with your utmost Eloquence enlarge Their Insolence and Rapes done in the City. Forget not too, I am their Chief; and tell her, You strongly think my extream Dotage on her, As I am Marullo, caus'd this sudden Uproar, To make Way to enjoy her. Timan. Punctually I will discharge my Part. [Exit Timandra. Enter Poliphron. Poliph. O, Sir, I sought you: You have miss'd the rarest Sport. Hell, I think, is broke loose, There's such Variety of all Disorders, As Leaping, Shouting, Drinking, Dancing, Whoring, Among the Slaves; answer'd with Crying, Howling, By the Citizens and their Wives. Such a Confusion! Pisan. I share in The Pleasure, though I'm absent. This is some Revenge for my Disgrace. Poliph. But, Sir, I fear, If your Authority restrain them not, They'l fire the City, or kill one another, They are so apt to Outrage, and so prone to Mischief; Neither know I whether you wish it, and came Therefore to acquaint you with so much. Pisand. I will among 'em, But must not long be absent. Poliph. That as you please. SCENE draws, and discovers Cleora in a Chair, in a melancholy Posture, Timandre attending. Shout at a Distance within. Timand. They are at our Gates, my Heart! Affrights and Horrors Increase each Minute: No Way left to save us, No flatt'ring Hope to comfort us, or Means By Miracle to redeem us from base Lust, And lawless Rapine? Are there Gods, yet suffer Such innocent Sweetness to be made the Spoil Of brutish Appetite? Marullo, curs'd Marullo, your own Bond-man; He that should offer up his Life to guard you, Purchas'd to serve you: Nay, start not, Lady: [Cleora starts. He, doting on your Beauty, has rais'd These mutinous Slaves, Who have begun the Game by violent Rapes Upon the Wives and Daughters of their Lords: And he, to quench his base Desires, By Force comes to enjoy you: Do not wring [Cleora wrings her Hands. Your innocent Hands, 'tis bootless; use the Means That may preserve you. 'Tis no Crime to break A Vow, when you are forc'd to it. Shew your Face, And with the Majesty of commanding Beauty Strike dead his loose Affections: If that fail, Give Liberty to your Tongue, and use Entreaties: There cannot be a Breast of Flesh and Blood, Or Heart so made of Flint, but must receive Impression from your Words. Will you not Do these good Offices to your self? Poor I, then, Can only weep your FortuneâHere he comes. Enter Pisander, speaking to some without. Pisand. He that advances A Foot beyond this, comes upon my Sword. You have had your Ways, disturb not mine. Timand. Speak gently, [Aside to Pisander. Her Fears may kill her else. Pisand. Now, Love, inspire me! Still shall this Canopy of envious Night Obscure my Suns of Comfort? The Organs of your Hearing yet are open, And you infringe no Vow, tho' you vouchsafe To hear the Story of A tortur'd and despairing Lover, whom Not Fortune, but Affection marks your Slave. [Cleora trembles. Nay, tremble not, fair Creature! for, believe me, you are As far from Danger as I am from Force. All the Violence I'll offer, tends no farther Than to relate my Suff'rings, which I dare not Presume to do, 'till by some gracious Sign You shew you are pleas'd to hear me. Timand. If you are, Hold forth your right Hand. [Cleora holds forth her right Hand. Pisand. My Soul's Thanks for the Favour. I forbear To tell you who I am, what Wealth, what Honours I made Change of to become your Servant: And tho' I knew worthy Leosthenes my Rival; (For sure, he must be worthy, for whose Love You dare endure so much) When Rage and Jealousy counsell'd me to kill him, (Which then I could have done with much more Ease, Than now, in Fear to grieve you, I dare speak it) Love, seconded with Duty, boldly told me, The Man I hated, fair Cleora favour'd; And that was his Protection. [Cleora bows. Timand. See, she bows Her Head in Sign of Thankfulness. Pisand. He remov'd, By th'Occasion of the War; my frantick Love Prompted me to do something in his Absence That might deliver you into my Power, Which you see is effected; and even now, When my rebellious Passions chide my Dulness, And tell me how much I abuse my Fortunes, Now 'tis in my Power to bear you hence, [Cleora starts. Or take my Wishes here, (nay, fear not, Madam, True Love's a Servant, brutish Lust a Tyrant) To me, without your Heart, your Beauty would be tasteless: And tho' your Heart is far beyond my Hope, Yet think it worth a Thought, at least, how truly I have lov'd, (I cannot say deserv'd; Since Duty must not take the Name of Merit) So far, alas, I prize your Peace, before All Blessings that my Hope can fashion to me, That willingly I entertain Despair, And for your Sake embrace it. For I know, This Opportunity lost, by no Endeavour The like can be recover'd. To conclude, Forget not, that I lose myself to save you. For what can I expect but Death and Torture, The War being ended? And, what is a Task Would trouble Hercules to undertake, I do deny you to myself, to give you A pure unspotted Present to my Rival. I've said: If it distaste not, best of Virgins, Reward my Temperance with some lawful Favour, Tho' you contemn my Person. [Cleora kneels, and offers her Hand to Pisander. Timand. See, she kneels, And seems to call upon the Gods to pay The Debt she owes your Virtue. To perform which, As a sure Pledge of Friendship, she vouchsafes Her Hand. [Makes a low Courtsy, and goes off. Pisand. This pays for all my Suff'rings. Now, when you please, pass to your private Chamber: My Love and Duty, faithful Guards, shall keep you From all Disturbance: And when you are sated With thinking of Leosthenes, as a Fee Due to my Service, spare one Sigh for me. [Exeunt. Enter Gracculo, leading Asotus in an Ape's Habit, with a Chain about his Neck. Grac. Come on, Sir. Asot. Oh! Grac. Do you grumble? You were ever A Brainless Ass, but if this hold, I'll teach you To come aloft, and do Tricks like an Ape. Your Morning's Lesson! If you missâ Asot. O no, Sir! Grac. What for the Carthaginians? [Makes Mouths, and chatters like a Monkey. âA good Beast. What for our Self, your Lord? [Jumps over a Stick. âExceeding well. Kiss your PawâSo, so, so. Enter Zanthia in Corisco's Cloaths, beating her in. Zant. Was ever Lady, the first Day of her Honour, So waited on by a wrinkled Crone? She looks now Without her Painting, Curling, and Perfumes Like the last Day of JanuaryâFarther off! SoâStand there like an ImageâIf you stir, 'Till with a Quarter of a Look I call you, You know what follows! Coris. O! what am I fall'n to? But 'tis a Punishment for my Vanity and Pride Justly return'd upon me. Grac. How do'st thou like Thy Ladyship, Zanthia? Zant. Very well; and bear it With as much State as your Lordship. Grac. Give me thy Hand: Let us, like conqu'ring Romans, walk in Triumph, Our Captives following. Then mount our Tribunals, And make the Slaves our Footstools. Zant. Fine, by Jove!â Are your Hands clean, Minion? Coris. Yes, forsooth. Zant. Fall off then.â Soânow come on; and having made your three Duties, Down I say, (are you stiff in the Hams?) now kneel, And tie our Shoe. Now kiss it and be happy. Grac. This is State indeed! Zant. It is such as she taught me; A tickling Itch of Greatness, your proud Ladies Expect from their poor Waiters: We have chang'd Parts; She does what she forc'd me to do in her Reign, And I must practise it in mine. Grac. 'Tis Justice. O here come more. Enter Cimbrio, Cleon, Poliphron, and Olimpia. Cimb. Discover to a Drachma, Or I will famish thee. Cleon. O! I am pin'd already. Cimb. Hunger shall force thee to cut off the Brawns From thy Arms and Thighs, then broil them on the Coals For Carbonadoes. Poliph. Spare the old Jade, he's founder'd. Grac. Cut his Throat then, And hang him out for a Scare-Crow. Poliph. You have all your Wishes In your Revenge, and I have mine. You see, I use no Tyranny: When I was her Slave, She kept me as a Sinner to lie at her Back In frosty Nights, and fed me high with costly Dainties; And in Requital of those Courtesies, Having made one another free, I marry'd her; And if you wish us Joy, join with us in A Dance at our Wedding. Grac. Agreed; for I have thought of A most triumphant one, which shall express, we are Lords, and these our Slaves. Poliph. But we shall want A Woman. Grac. No, here's Jane of Apes shall serveâ Carry your Body swimming: Where's the Musick? Poliph. I've plac'd it in yon Window. Grac. Begin then sprightly. [Dance. Enter Pisander unseen. Poliph. Well done on all Sides. I have prepar'd a Banquet; Let's drink and cool us. Grac. A good Motion. Cimb. Wait hereâ You have been tir'd with Feasting, learn to fast now. Grac. I'll have an Apple for Jack, and may be some Scraps May fall to your Share. [Exeunt Gracculo, Zanthia, Cimbrio, Poliphron, Olimpia. Coris. Whom can we accuse But our selves for what we suffer? And Misery Instructs me now, that Yesterday acknowledg'd To Deity beyond my Luxury and Pride. Now, miserable I, to please whose Palate The Elements were ransack'd, yet complain'd Of Nature, as not liberal enough, In her Provision of Rarities, To sooth my Taste, and pamper my proud Flesh, Now wish in vain for Bread. Cleon. Yes, I do wish too For what I fed my Dogs with. Coris. I that forgot I was made of Flesh and Blood, and thought Silk Too coarse to cloath me, and the softest Down Too hard to sleep on; that disdain'd to look On Vertue being in Rags; And from those that serv'd me Expected Adoration, am made justly The Scorn of my own Bond-Woman! Asot. I am punish'd For seeking to cuckold mine own natural Father. Had I been gelded then, or bore my self Like a Man, I had not been transform'd, and Forc'd to play an over-grown Ape. Cleon. I know I can't last long, That's all my Comfort: Come, I forgive both; It is in vain to be angry; let us therefore Lament together like Friends. Pisan. What a true Mirrour Were this sad Spectacle for secure Greatness! Here they that never see themselves, but in The Glass of servile Flattery, might behold The weak Foundation upon which they build That trust in human Frailty. Happy are those That knowing in their Births they are subject to Uncertain Change, are still prepar'd and arm'd For either Fortune. A rare Principle, And with much Labour learn'd in Wisdom's School! So these Wretches, Swoln with the false Opinion of their Worth, And proud of Blessings left them, not acquir'd, That did believe they could with Giant-Arms Fathom the Earth, and were above their Fates, Those borrow'd Helps that did support them vanish'd, Fall of themselves, and by unmanly Suff'ring Betray their proper Weakness, and make known Their Greatness was but lent 'em, not their own. Cleon. O! for some Meat, they sit long. Coris. We forgot, When we drew out intemperate Feasts till Midnight, Their Hunger was not thought on, nor their Watchings; Nor did we hold our selves serv'd to the Height, But when we did exact and force their Duties Beyond their Strength and Power. Asot. We pay for't now: I now could be content to have my Head Broke with a Rib of Beef, or for a Coffin Be bury'd in the Dripping Pan. Enter Poliphron, Cimbrio, Gracculo, Zanthia, Olimpia, drunk and quarrelling. Cimb. Do not hold me: Not kiss the Bride! Poliph. No, Sir. Cimb. She's a common Good; And so we'll use her. Grac. We'll have nothing private. Olimp. Holdâ Zant. Here, Marulloâ Olimp. He's Chief. Cimb. We are Equals; I will know no Obedience. Grac. Nor Superior.â Poliph. Nay, if you are Lion-drunk, I'll make one. Pisan. Art thou Mad too? No more, as you respect me. Poliph. I obey, Sir. Pisan. Quarrel among your selves? Cimb. Yes, in our Wine, Sir, And for our Wenches. Grac. How could we be Lords else? Pisan. Take heed, I have News will cool this Heat, And make you remember what you were. Cimb. How? Pisan. Send off these, And then I'll tell you. [Zanthia beating Corisca. Olimp. This is Tyranny, Now she offends not. Zant. 'Tis for Exercise, And to help Digestion: What is she good for else? To me it was her Language. Pisan. Leave her off; And take heed, Madam Minx, the Wheel may turn. Go to your Meat and Rest, and from this Hour Remember, He that is a Lord to Day, May be a Slave to Morrow. Cleon. Good Morality! [Exeunt Cleon, Asotus, Zanthia, Olimpia, Corisca. Cimb. But what would you impart? Pisan. What must invite you To stand upon your Guard, and leave your Feasting; Or but imagine what it is to be Most miserable, and rest assur'd you are so. Our Masters are victorious! All. How! Pisan. Within A Days March of the City, flesh'd with Spoil, And proud of Conquest, the Armado sunk, The Carthaginian Admiral, Hand to Hand, Slain by Leosthenes Cimb. I feel the Whip Upon my Back already. Grac. Every Man Seek a convenient Tree and hang himself. Poliph. Better die once, than live an Age to suffer New Tortures every Hour. Cimb. Say, we submit, And yield us to their Mercy? Pisan. Can you flatter Your selves with such false Hopes? We have gone too far To think now of retiring. In our Courage And During lies our Safety; if you are not Slaves in your abject Minds, as in your Fortunes, Since to die is the worst, better expose Our naked Breasts to their keen Swords, and sell Our Lives with the most Advantage, than to trust In a forestall'd Remission, or yield up Thrice heated with Revenge. Grac. You led us on. Cimb. And, 'tis but Justice, you should bring us off. Grac. And we expect it. Pisan. Hear then, and obey me; And I will either save you, or fall with you; Man the Walls strongly, and make good the Ports, Boldly deny their Entrance, and rip up Your Grievances, and what compell'd you to This desp'rate Course: If they disdain to hear Of Composition, we have in our Pow'rs Their aged Fathers, Children, and their Wives, Who, to preserve themselves, must willingly Make Intercession for us. 'Tis not Time now To talk, but do. A glorious End or Freedom Is now propos'd us; stand resolv'd for either, Like Men born free, we'll live, or die together. Omnes. Ay, all die together. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IV. Scene I. Enter Pisander and Timandra. Pisan. She has her Health then? Timan. Yes, Sir, and as often As I speak of you, lends attentive Ear To all that I deliver; nor seems tir'd, Though I dwell long on the Relation of Your Suff'rings for her, heaping Praise on Praise, On your unequal Temperance and Command You hold o'er your Affections. Pisan. To my Wish! Have you acquainted her with the Defeat Of the Carthaginians, and with what Honours Leosthenes comes Home crown'd with? Timan. With all Care. Pisan. And how does she receive it? Timan. As I guess, With a seeming kind of Joy, but yet appears not Transported, or proud of his happy Fortune. But when I tell her of the certain Ruin You must encounter with at their Arrival In Syracusa, and that Death with Torments Must fall upon youâ Pisan. Does she then pity my Misfortunes? Timan. She express'd All Signs of Sorrow; at the first hearing She fell upon her Face, rent her fair Hair, Her Hands held up to Heaven, and vented Sighs, In which she silently seem'd to complain Of Heaven's Injustice. Pisan. Enough! Wait carefully, And upon all watch'd Occasions, continue Speech, and discourse of me: 'Tis Time must work her. Timan. I'll not be wanting, but still strive to serve you. [Exit Timandra. Enter Poliphron. Pisan. Now, Poliphron, the News? Poliph. The conqu'ring Army Is within our View. Pisan. How brook the Slaves the Object? Poliph Chearfully yet; they do refuse no Labour, And seem to scoff at Danger: 'Tis your Presence That must confirm them. With a full Consent You are chosen to relate the Tyranny Of our proud Masters; and what you subscribe to They gladly will allow of, or hold it out Ev'n to the last Man. Pisan. I'll instantly among 'em: If we prove constant to our selves, good Fortune Will not, I hope, forsake us. Poliph. That, Sir, indeed, is now our only Refuge. [Exeunt. Trumpets flourish an Overture of Victory. Enter Timoleon, Archidamus, Diphilus, Leosthenes, Timagoras, and others. Timol. Thus far we are return'd Victorious, crown'd With Wreaths triumphant; And have now brought Home Security and Peace.â'Tis therefore fit That such as boldly stood the Shock of War, And with the dear Expence of Sweat and Blood Have purchas'd Honour, should with Pleasure reap The Harvest of their Toil; and we stand bound, Out of the first File of the best Deservers, Lo think of you, Leosthenes, that stand, And worthily most dear in our Esteem, For your heroick Valour. Archid. When I look on (The Labour of so many Men and Ages) This well-built City, not long since design'd To Spoil and Rapine, by the Favour of The Gods, and you their Ministers, preserv'd, I cannot in my Heighth of Joy but offer These Tears for a glad Sacrifice. Diph. Sleep the Citizens? Or are they o'erwhelm'd with the Excess Of Comfort that flows to them, That here they meet us not. Leost. We receive A silent Entertainment. Timag. I long since expected, That the Virgins and the Matrons, The old Men striving with their Age, the Priests Carrying the Images of their Gods before 'em, Should have met us with Procession.âHa! the Gates Are shut against us! Enter upon the Walls, Pisander, Poliphron, Cimbrio, Gracculo, &amp;c. Archid. And upon the Walls Arm'd Men seem to defy us! Diph. I should know These Faces.âThey are our Slaves! Timag. The Mystery, Rascals? Open the Ports, and play not with an Anger That will consume you. Timol. This is above Wonder! Archid. Our Bond-men stand against us! Grac. Some such Things We were in Man's Remembrance.â The Slaves are turn'd Lords of the Town, or so.âNay, be not angry; Perhaps, on good Terms, giving Security, You will be quiet Men, we may allow you Some Lodgings in our Garrets, or Out-houses: Your great Looks cannot carry it. Cimb. The Truth is, We have made a little bold with your Wives, Toy'd with your Daughters, or so, Sir. Leost. O my prophetick Soul! Grac. Rifled your Chests, Been busy with your Wardrobes. Timag. Can we endure this? Leost. Oh! my Cleora! Grac. A Crawdle for the Gentleman; He'll die o'th'Pip else. Timag. Scorn'd too! Are you turn'd Stone? Hold Parley with our Bond-men? Force our Entrance, Then Villains expectâ Timol. Hold! You wear Mens Shapes, And if like Men you have Reason, shew a Cause That leads you to this desp'rate Course, which must End In your Destruction. Grac. That as please the Fates; But we vouchsafeâSpeak Captain. Timag. Hell and Furies! Archid. Bay'd by our own Currs; Cimb. Take heed you be not worry'd. Polip. We are sharp set. Cimb. And sudden. Pisand. Briefly thus then, Since I must speak for all.âYour Tyranny Drew us from our Obedience. Happy those Times When Lords were styl'd Fathers of Families, And not imperious Masters; when they number'd Their Servants almost equal with their Sons, Or one Degree beneath them; when their Labours Were cherish'd and rewarded, and a Period Set to their Suff'rings. Humanity then lodg'd in the Hearts of Men, And thankful Masters carefully provided For Creatures wanting Reason. The noble Horse, That in his fiery Youth from his wide Nostrils Neigh'd Courage to his Rider, and broke through Groves of oppos'd Pikes, bearing his Lord Safe to triumphant Vict'ry, old or wounded, Was set at Liberty, and freed from Service: The Athenian Mules, that from the Quarry drew Marble, hew'd for the Temples of the Gods, The great Work ended, were dismiss'd, and fed At the publick Cost; nay, faithful Dogs have found Their Sepulchres; but Man, to Man more cruel, Appoints no End to the Suff'rings of his Slave; Who, grown unuseful, Are less esteem'd than Beasts.âThis you have practis'd, Practis'd on us with Rigour: This has forc'd us To shake our heavy Yokes off; and if Redress Of these just Grievances be not granted us, We'll right our selves, and by strong Hand defend What we are now possess'd of. Grac. And not leave One House unfir'd. Cimb. Or Throat uncut of those We have in our Power. Polip. Nor will we fall alone; we are resolv'd That you shall buy us dearly. Timag. Oh! the Gods! Unheard of Insolence! Timol. What are your Demands? Pisand. A general Pardon first for all Offences Committed in your Absence: Liberty To all such as desire to make return Into their Countries; and to those that stay, A Competency of Land freely allotted To each Man's proper Use; no Lord acknowledg'd. Lastly, with your Consent, to choose them Wives Out of your Families. Timag. Let the City sink first! Leost. And Ruin seize on all, ere we subscribe To such Conditions. Archid. Carthage, tho' victorious, Could not have forc'd more from us. Leost. Scale the Walls! Capitulate after. Timol. He that wins the Top first, Shall wear a mural Wreath. [Exeunt. Pisan. Each to his Place. [Shouts and Alarms without. Or Death or Victory.â Charge them Home, and fear not. Enter Timoleon, Archidamus, Diphilus, Leosthenes, Timagoras, and other Senators. Timol. We wrong our selves, and we are justly punish'd, To deal with Bond-men as if we encounter'd An equal Enemy. Archid. They fight like Devils; And run upon our Swords, as if their Breasts Were Proof beyond their Armour. Timag. Make a firm Stand.â The Slaves not satisfy'd, they have beat us off; Prepare to sally forth. Timol. They are wild Beasts, And to be tam'd by Policy.âEach Man take A tough Whip in his Hand, such as you us'd To punish them, as Masters: In your Looks Carry Severity and Awe; 'twill fright them More than your Weapons: Salvage Lions fly from The Sight of Fire; and these that have forgot That Duty you ne'er taught them with your Swords, When, unexpected, they behold those Terrors Advanc'd aloft, that they were made to shake at, 'Twill force them to remember what they are, And stoop to do Obedience. [Exeunt, and return with Whips. Enter Cimbrio, Gracculo, and other Slaves.â Archid. Here they come. Cimb. Leave not a Man alive: A Wound is but a Flea biting To what we suffer'd being Slaves. Grac. Oh! my Heart! Cimbrio, what do we see? The Whip! Our Masters! Timag. Dare you rebel, Slaves? [Senators shake their Whips, and they throw away their Weapons, and run off. Cimb. Mercy, Mercy! Where Shall we hide us from their Fury? Grac. Fly! they follow! Oh! we shall be tormented. Timol. Enter with them; But yet forbear to kill them: Still remember They are Part of your Wealth; and, being disarm'd, There is no Danger. Archid. Let us first deliver Such as they have in Fetters, and at Leisure Determine of their Punishment. Leost. Friend, to you I leave the Disposition of what's mine: I cannot think I am safe without your Sister.â She's only worth my Thought; and 'till I see What she has suffer'd, I am on the Rack, And Furies my Tormentors. [Exeunt. Enter Pisander and Timandra. Pisand. I know I am pursu'd; nor would I fly, Altho' the Ports were open, and a Convoy Ready to bring me off.âThe Baseness of These Villains, from the Pride of all my Hopes, Have thrown me to the Bottomless Abyss Of Horror and Despair: Had they stood firm, I could have bought Cleora's free Consent With the Safety of her Father's Life, and Brothers; And forc'd Leosthenes to quit his Claim, And kneel a Suitor to me. Timand. You must not think What might have been, but what must now be practis'd, And suddenly resolve. Pisand. All my poor Fortunes Are at the Stake, and I must run the Hazard. Unseen, convey me to Cleora's Chamber; For in her Sight, if it were possible, I would be apprehended.âDo not enquire The Reason why, but help me. [Knocking without. Timand. Make haste.âOne knocksâ [Exit. Pisand. Jove turn all to the best.â Enter Leosthenes. You are welcome, Sir. Leost. Thou giv'st it in a heavy Tone. Timand. Alas! Sir, We have so long fed on the Bread of Sorrow, Drinking the bitter Water of Afflictions, Made loathsome too by our continued Fears, Comfort's a Stranger to us. Leost. Fears! Your Suff'rings For which I am so overgone with Grief, I dare not ask without compassionate Tears, The Villain's Name that robb'd thee of thy Honour: For being train'd up in Chastity's cold School, And taught by such a Mistress as Cleora, 'Twere impious in me to think Timandra Fell with her own Consent. Timand. How mean you, Fell, Sir! I understand you not. Leost. I would thou did'st not; Or that I could not read upon thy Face, In blushing Characters, the Story of Libidinous RapeâConfess it, for you stand not Accountable for a Sin, against whose Strength Your o'er-match'd Innocence could make no Resistance: Under which Odds I know Cleora fell too, Heav'n's Help in vain invok'dâTh'amazed Sun, Hiding his Face behind a Mask of Clouds, Not daring to look on'tâIn her Sufferings All Sorrow's comprehendedâWhat Timandra, Or the City has endur'd, (her Loss consider'd) Deserves not to be nam'd. Timand. Pray you, do not bring, Sir, In the Chimera's of your Jealous Fears, New Monsters to affright us. Leost. O Timandra! That I had Faith enough but to believe thee, I should receive it with a Joy beyond Assurance of Elyzian Shades hereafter, âBut I must not Credit Impossibilities; yet I strive To find out that whose Knowledge is a Curse, And Ignorance a BlessingâCome, discover What Kind of Look he had that forc'd thy Lady, (Thy Ravisher I will enquire at Leisure) That when hereafter I behold a Stranger But near him in Aspect, I may conclude, Tho' Men and Angels should proclaim him honest, He is a Hell-bred Villain. Timand. You are unworthy To know she is preserv'd, preserv'd untainted. Sorrow (but only ill bestow'd) hath made A Rape upon her Comforts in your Absence. [Exit, and returns with Cleora. Come forth, dear Madam. Leost. Ha! [Kneels. Timan. Nay, she deserves The Bending of your Heart, that, to content you, Has kept a Vow, the Breach of which a Vestal Must of Force have shrunk at. No Danger could compel her to dispense with Her cruel Penance; tho' hot Lust came arm'd To seize upon her; when one Look, or Accent, Might have redeem'd her. Leost. Might? O do not shew me A Beam of Comfort, and strait take it from me. The Means by which she was freed? Speak, O speak quickly; Each Minute of Delay's an Age of Torment. O speak, Timandra. Timan. Free her from her Oath, Herself can best deliver it. Leost. O blest Office! [Takes off the Scarf. Never did Galley Slave shake off his Chains, Or look'd on his Redemption from the Oar, With such true Feeling of Delight, as now I find myself possess'd ofâNow I behold True Light indeedâ Open these long-shut Lips, and strike my Ears With Musick more harmonious than the Spheres Yield in their Heavenly Motions: And if ever A true Submission for a Crime acknowledg'd May find a gracious Hearing, teach your Tongue In the first sweet articulate Sounds it utters To sign my wish'd for Pardon. Cleor. I forgive you. Leost. How greedily I receive this! Stay, best Lady, And let me by Degrees ascend the Height Of human Happiness!âAll at once deliver'd, The Torrent of my Joys will overwhelm me; Have you not (By your unspotted Truth, I do conjure you To answer truly) suffer'd in your Honour, (By Force, I mean, for in your Will I free you) Since I left Syracusa? Cleor. I restore This Kiss, (so help me Goodness) which I borrow'd When I saw you. Leost. Miracle of Vertue! Yet I cannot Fix here; but must enquire the Man, to whom I stand indebted for a Benefit, Which, to requite full, tho' in this Hand I grasp'd all Scepters the Worlds Empire bows to, Would leave me a poor BankruptâName him, Lady; If a mean Estate, I'll gladly part with My utmost Fortunes to himâBut if Noble, In thankful Duty study how to serve him: Or if of higher Rank; erect him Altars, And (as a God) adore him. Cleor. If that Goodness, And noble Temperance, bridling rebellious Passions, Did ever wing great Minds to fly to Heaven; He that preserv'd mine Honour, may hope boldly To fill a Seat among the Gods, and shake off Our frail Corruption. Leost. You describe a Wonder. Cleor. Which will increase, when you shall understand He was a Lover. Leost. A Lover! Oh, my Heart! Cleor. Yes, Lov'd me, Leosthenes: Nay more, so passionately That he durst not, With an immodest Syllable, or Look, Discover I was the Saint he sigh'd for. Leost. Is't possible! Cleor. I cannot speak him to his Worth: All Praise I can bestow upon him, will appear Envious Detraction. Not to rack you farther, Yet make the Miracle full; tho', of all Men, He hated you, Leosthenes, as his Rival, So high yet priz'd my Content, that knowing You were a Man I favour'd, he disdain'd, Against himself to serve you. Leost. You conceal still The owner of these Excellencies. Cleor. 'Tis Marullo, My Father's Bond-man. Leost. I have not deserv'd your Mockery, Lady. Cleor. Nor he your Scorn! Leost. Do you call What was his Duty, Merit? Cleor. Yes, and place it As high in my Esteem, as all the Honours Descended from your Ancestors, or the Glory, Which you may call your own, got in this Action, In which, I must confers, you have done nobly. And I could addâas I desir'dâbut that I fear, 'twould make you proud. Leost. Oh, Heaven! Can you Be won to give Allowance, that your Slave Should dare to love you? Cleor. The Immortal Gods Accept the meanest Altars that are rais'd By pure Devotions; and sometimes prefer The poorest Frankincense, Honey, or Milk, Before whole Hecatombes, or SabÃ¦an Gums, Offer'd in OstentationâAre you sick Of your old Disease? I'll fit you. [Aside. Leost. You seem mov'd. Cleor. Zealous, I grant, in the Defence of Vertue. Why, good Leosthenes, tho' I endur'd A Penance, for your Sake, above Example; I have not so far sold myself, I take it, To be at your Devotion, but I may Cherish Desert in others, where I find it. How would you tyrannize, if you stood possess'd of That which is only yours in Expectation, That now prescribe such hard Conditions to me? Leost. Forgive me! One Kiss, and I am silenc'd. Cleor. I vouchsafe it; Yet, I must tell you, 'tis a Favour that Marullo, when I was his, not mine own, Durst not presume to askâNo; when the City Bow'd humbly to licentious Rapes and Riot, And when I was of Men and Gods forsaken, Deliver'd to his Power, he did not press me To grace him with one Look or Syllable, Or urg'd the Dispensation of an Oath Made for your SatisfactionâThe poor Wretch Having related only his own Sufferings, And kiss'd my Hand, which I could not deny him, Defending me from others, never since Solicited my Favours. Leost. Pray you, end; The Story does not please me. Cleor. Well, take Heed Of Doubts and FearsâFor, know, Leosthenes, A greater Injury cannot be offer'd To innocent Chastity, than unjust Suspicion. I love Marullo's Mind, and not his Person: Let that secure you. And I here command you, If I have any Power in you, to stand Between him and all PunishmentâIf you fail, I will not threaten; but rememberâ Your Gen'rous Rival spar'd me in his Power; He's now in yours, I ask of you no more. [Exit. Leost. What a Bridge Of Glass I walk upon, over a River Of certain Ruin; my own weighty Fears Cracking what should support meâAnd those Helps Which Confidence yields to others, are from me Ravish'd by Doubts and anxious Jealousy. [Exit. Enter Timagoras, Cleon, Asotus, Corisca, Olimpia. Cleon, But are you sure we are safe? Timag. You need not fear; They are all under Guard; their Fangs par'd off; The Wounds their Insolence gave you, to be cur'd With the Balm of your Revenge. Asot. And shall I be The Thing I was born, my Lord? Timag. The same wise Thingâ 'Slight, what a Beast they have made thee! Africk never Produc'd the like. Asot. I think soâNor the Land Where Apes and Monkeys grow, like Crabs and Wallnuts, On the same Tree. Not all the Catalogue Of Conjurers, or wise Women, bound together, Could have so soon transform'd me, as my Rascal Did with his Whip; not in Outside only, But in my own Belief, I thought myself As perfect a Baboonâ Timag. An Ass thou wert ever. Asot. And would have given one Leg, with all my Heart, To have been a Man again, Tho' I had dy'd on Crutches. Cleon, Never Varlets So triumph'd o'er an old fat ManâI was famish'd. Timag. Indeed, you are fall'n away. Asot. Three Years of Feeding On Cullises and Jelly, tho' his Cooks Lard all he eats with Marrow, or his Doctors Pour in his Mouth Restoratives as he sleeps, Will not recover him. Timag. But your Ladyship looks sad on the Matter. Coris. Pray you, forbearâI am an alter'd Woman. Timag. So it seems; A Part of your Honour's Coife stands out of Rank too. Coris. No Matter, I have other Thoughts. Timag. O strange! Not ten Days since, it would have vex'd you more Than the Loss of your good NameâPity this Cure For your proud Itch came no sooner! Marry, Olympia Seems to bear up still. Olymp. I complain not, Sir; I have born my Fortune patiently. Timag. Thou wert ever An excellent Bearer; so is all your Tribe, If you may choose your CarriageâHow now, Friend, Looks our Cleora lovely? Enter Leosthenes and Diphilus, with Guards. Leost. In my Thoughts, Sir. Timag. But why this Guard? Diph. It is Timoleon's Pleasure; The Slaves have been examin'd, and confess Their Riot took beginning from your House: And the first Mover of them to Rebellion, Your Slave Marullo. Leost. Ha! I more than fear. Timag. Then search boldly. Enter Timandra. Timand. You are unmanner'd Grooms To prie into my Lady's private Lodgings; There's no Marullo's there. Enter Diphilus with Pisander. Timag. Now I suspect tooâ Where found you him? Diph. Close hid in your Sister's Chamber. Timag. Is that the Villain's Sanctuary? Leost. This confirms All she deliver'd, false. Timag. But that I scorn To rust my Sword in thy slavish Blood, Thou now wert dead. Pisand. He that insults upon unweapon'd Innocence, Is more a Slave than Fortune or Misery can make me. Timag. Do you prate, you Dog? Pisand. Curs snap at Lions in the Toil, whose looks Frighted them, being free. Timag. As a wild Beast, Drive him before you. Pisand. O, divine Cleora! Leost. Dar'st thou presume to name her? Pisand. Yes, and love her: And may say, have deserv'd her. Timag. Stop his Mouth: Load him with Irons too. [Exit Guard with Pisand. Cleon. I am deadly sick To look on him. Asot. If he get loose, I know it, I caper like an Ape againâI feel The Whip already. Timand. This goes to my Lady. [Aside. Timag. Come, cheer up, Sir; we'll urge his Punishment To the full Satisfaction of your Anger. Leost. He is not worth my ThoughtsâNo Corner left, In all the spacious Rooms of my vex'd Heart, But is fill'd with CleoraâAnd the Rape She's done upon her Honour, with my Wrong, The heavy Burden of my Sorrow's Song. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. Scene I. Enter Archidamus and Cleora. Archid. Thou art thine own Disposerâ(Yet I must confess, Leosthenes is most worthy)âyet, I will not, However I may counsel) force Affection. Cleor. It needs not, Sir; I prize him to his Worth, Nay, love him truly; yet would not live slav'd To his jealous Humours; since, by the Hopes of Heaven, As I am free from ViolenceâIn a Thought I am not guilty. Archid. 'Tis believ'd, Cleora, And much the rather, (our great Gods be prais'd for't) In that I find, beyond my Hopes, no Sign Of Riot in my House, but all Things order'd, As if I had been present. Cleor. May that move you To pity poor Marullo. Archid. 'Tis my Purpose To do him all the Good I can, Cleora: But this Offence being against the State, Must have a publick Trialâ I must to the Senate. [Exit. Cleor. I am much distractedâIn Leosthenes I can find nothing justly to accuse, But this Excess of Love, which I have studied To cure with more than common Means; yet still It grows upon himâAnd if I may call My Sufferings Merit, I stand bound to think on Marullo's DangersâTho' I save his Life, His Love is unrewardedâI confess, Both have deserv'd me; yet of Force must be Unjust to oneâSuch is my Destiny. Enter Timandra. How now? Whence flow these Tears? Timand. I have met, Madam, An Object of such Cruelty, as would force A Savage to Compassion. Cleor. SpeakâWhat is it? Timand. Men pity Beasts of Rapine, if o'er-match'd, Tho' baited for their PleasureâBut these Monsters, Upon a Man that can make no Resistance, Are senseless in their Tyranny.âLet it be granted, Marullo is a Slave, he's still a Manâ A Capital Offender; yet, in Justice, Not to be tortur'd, 'till the Judge pronounce His Punishment. Cleor. Where is he? Timand. Dragg'd to Prison With more than barb'rous Violence, spurn'd and spit on By th'insulting Officers, his Hands Pinion'd behind his BackâLoaden with Fetters: Yet, with a Saint-like Patience he still offers His Face to their rude Buffets. Cleor. O, my griev'd Soul! By whose Command? Timand. It seems, my Lord, your Brother; For he's a Looker onâAnd it takes from Honour'd Leosthenes to suffer it, For his Respect to you, whose Name, in vain, The griev'd Wretch loudly calls on. Cleor. By Diana, 'Tis base in both, and to their Teeth I'll tell 'em That I am wrong'd in it. [Going. Timand. What will ye do? Cleor. In Person Visit and comfort him. Timand. That will bring Fuel To the jealous Fires, which burn too fierce already In Lord Leosthenes. Cleor. Let them consume himâ I am Mistress of myselfâWhere Cruelty reigns, There dwells nor Love nor Honour. [Exit Cleora. Timand. So, it works. Tho' hitherto I have run a desperate Course, To serve my Brother's Purposes, now 'tis fit I study my own EndsâThey comeâAssist me In these my Undertakings, Love's great Patron, As my Intents are honest. [Retires to the Side of the Stage. Enter Leosthenes and Timagoras. Leost. 'Tis my Fault, Distrust of others springs, Timagoras, From Diffidence in our selves. But I will strive, With the Assurance of my Worth and Merits, To kill this Monster, Jealousy. Timag, 'Tis a Guest, In Wisdom, never to be entertain'd On trivial Probabilities; but when He does appear in pregnant Proofs, not fashion'd By idle Doubts and Fears, to be receiv'd. Tho' I prize Cleora's Honour equal with my own, 'Tis far from my Ambition for her Cure, That you should wound your self. Timan. This argues for me. [Aside. Timag. Why she should be so passionate for a Bond-Man, Falls not in Compass of my Understanding, But for some nearer Interest; or he raise This Mutiny, if he lov'd her (as you say She does confess he did) but to enjoy, By fair or foul Play, what he ventur'd for, To me's a Riddle. Leost. Pray you, no more; already I have answer'd that Objection in my strong Assurance of her Vertue. Timag. 'Tis unfit then, That I should press it farther. Timan. Now I must [Timandra comes forward distractedly. Make in, or all is lost. Timag. What would Timandra? Leost. How wild she looks? How is it with thy Lady? Timan. O! the best of Ladies, I fear, is gone for ever. Leost. Who! Cleora! Timag. Deliver how! 'Sdeath, be a Man, Sir! speak. Timan. Take it then in as many Sighs as Words: My Ladyâ Timag. What of her? Timan. No sooner heard Marullo was imprison'd, but she fell Into a deadly Swoon. Timag. But she recover'd. This is unmanly! Timan. Brought again to Life, But with much Labour, she a while stood silent, Yet in that interim vented Sighs, as if They labour'd, from the Prison of her Flesh, To give her griev'd Soul Freedom. On the sudden, Transported on the Wings of Rage and Sorrow, She flew out of the House, and, unattended, Enter'd the common Prison. Leost. This confirms What but before I fear'd. Timan. There you may find her, And if you love her as a Sisterâ Timag. Damn her! Timan. Or you respect her Safety as a Lover, Procure Marullo's Pardon. Timag. Impudence Beyond Expression! Leost. Shall I be a Bawd To her Lust and my Dishonour? Timan. She'll run mad else, Or do some violent Act upon her self. My Lord, her Father, sensible of her Suff'rings, Labours to gain his Freedom. Leost. O! the Devil! Has she bewitch'd him too? Timag. I'll hear no more: Come, Sir, we'll follow her; and if no Perwasion Can make her take again her natural Form, Which by Lust's powerful Spell she has cast off, This Sword shall dis-inchant her. Leost. O. my Heart-strings! [Exeunt Leosthenes and Timagoras. Timan. I knew 'twould take. Pardon me, fair Cleora, Tho' I appear a Trayt'ress; which thou wilt do In pity of my Woes, when I make known My lawful Claim, and only seek my own. [Exit. SCENE A Prison. Enter Cleora, Jaylor, and Pisander. Cleora. There's for your Privacy. Stay, unbind his Hands. Jaylor. I dare not, Madam. Cleora. I will buy thy Danger: Take more Gold, do not trouble me with Thanks; I do suppose it done. [Exit Jaylor. Pisan. My better Angel Assumes this Shape to comfort me, and wisely, Since from the Choice of all CÅlestial Figures, He could not take a visible Form so full Of glorious Sweetness. [Kneels. Cleora. Rise, I am Flesh and Blood, And do partake thy Tortures. Pisan. Can it be? That Charity should perswade you to descend So far from your own Height, as to vouchsafe To look upon my Suff'rings? How I bless My Fetters now, and stand ingag'd to Fortune For my Captivity; no, my Freedom rather! For who dares think that Place a Prison, which You sanctify with your Presence? Do you weep for me? O, save that precious Balm for nobler Uses! I am unworthy of the smallest Drop, Which in your Prodigality of Pity You throw away on me. I'm justly punish'd For my Intent of Violence to such Pureness, And all the Torments Flesh is sensible of, A soft and gentle Penance. Cleora. Which is ended In this your free Confession. Enter Leosthenes and Timagoras unseen. Leost. What an Object Have I encounter'd? Timag. I am blasted too! Yet hear a little farther. Pisan. Could I expire now, These white and innocent Hands closing my Eyes, 'Twere not to die, but in a heavenly Dream To be transported to Elizium. You make me bold; and but to wish such Happiness, I fear, may give Offence. Cleora. No, for believe it, Marullo, You have won so much upon me, that I know not That Happiness in my Gift, but you may challenge. Leost. Are you yet satisfy'd? Cleora. Nor can you wish, But what my Vows will second, though it were Your Freedom first, and that purchas'd. In what concerns your farther Aims, I speak it, Do not Despair, but Hope. Timag. To have the Hangman, When he is marry'd to the Cross, in Scorn To say, Gods give you Joy. Leost. And now (but that Grief stops my Speech) imagine, What Language I should use? [Goes between 'em. Cleora. Against thy self:â Thy Malice cannot reach me. Timag. How! Cleora. No, Brother! Though you join in the Dialogue to accuse me, I'll justify my Honour! Though Jealousy use all her Eyes to spy out One Stain in my Behaviour, or Envy As many Tongues to wound it; I can in my Defence alledge such Reasons As my Accusers shall stand dumb to hear 'em, When, in his Fetters, this Man's Worth and Vertues, But truly told, shall shame your boasted Glories, Which Fortune claims a Share in. Timag. The base Villain Shall never live to bear it. [Draws, and offers to stab Pisander, Cleora interposes. Cleora. Murder! Help! Through me you shall pass to him. Enter Archidamus, Diphilus, and Officers. Archid. What's the Matter? On whom is your Sword drawn? You are bold too! Unhand my Daughter. Leost. She's my Valour's Prize. Archid. With her Consent, not otherwise. You may urge Your Title in the Court; if it prove good, Possess her freely. Guard him safely off too. Timag. You'll hear me, Sir? Archid. If you have ought to say, Deliver it in Publick; all shall find A just Judge of Timoleon. Diph. You must, Of Force, now use your Patience. [Exeunt Archidamus, Diphilus, and Guards. Timag. Vengeance rather! Whirlwinds of Rage possess me! You are wrong'd Beyond a Stoick's Suff'rance, yet you stand As you were rooted. Leost. I feel something here, That boldly tells me, all the Love and Service I pay Cleora, is another's due, And therefore cannot prosper. Timag. Melancholy! Which now you must not yield to. Leost. 'Tis apparent, In Fact your Sister's innocent, however Chang'd by her violent Will. Timag. If you believe so, Follow the Chace still; and in open Court Plead your own Interest: We shall find the Judge Our Friend, I fear not. Leost. Something I shall say, But whatâ Timag. Collect your self as we walk thither. [Exeunt. SCENE The Court of Justice. Enter Timoleon, Archidamus, Cleon, and Officers. Timol. 'Tis wonderful strange! nor can it fall within The Reach of my Belief, a Slave should be The Owner of a Temperance, which this Age Can hardly parallel in free-born Lords, Or Kings, proud of their Purple. Archid. 'Tis most true; And though at first it did appear a Fable, All Circumstances meet to give it Credit; Which work'd on me, that I am compell'd To be a Suitor, not to be deny'd, He may have equal Hearing. Cleora. Sir, you grac'd me With the Title of your Mistress; but my Fortune Is so far distant from Command, that I Lay by the Power you gave me, and plead humbly For the Preserver of my Fame and Honour. And pray you, Sir, in Charity believe; That since I had Ability of Speech, My Tongue has so much been inur'd to Truth, I know not what the Speech of Falshood is. Timol. I'll rather doubt The Oracles of the Gods, than question what Your Innocence delivers: And as far As Justice with my Honour can give Way, He shall have Favour. Bring him in unbound. [Exeunt Officers. And although Leosthenes may challenge from me, For his late worthy Service, Credit to All Things he can alledge in his own Cause, Marullo (so I think you call his Name) Shall find I do reserve one Ear for him, To let in Mercy. Enter Cleon, Asotus, Diphilus, Olympia, and Corisca. Timol. Sit and take your Places: The Right of this fair Virgin first determin'd, Your Bond-Men shall be censur'd. Cleon. With all Rigour, We do expect.â Coris. Temper'd, I say, with Mercy. Enter at one Door Leosthenes and Timagoras; at the other, Officers with Pisander and Timandra. Timol. Your Hand, Leosthenes: I cannot doubt, You that have been victorious in the War, Should in a Combat fought with Words come off, But with assured Triumph. Leost. My Deserts, Sir, (If without Arrogance I may stile them such) Arm me from Doubt and Fear. Timol. 'Tis nobly spoken! Nor be thou daunted (howsoe'er thy Fortune Has mark'd thee out a Slave) to speak thy Merits. For Vertue, though in Rags, may challenge more Than Vice set off with all the Trim of Greatness. Pisan. I had rather fall under so just a Judge, Than be acquitted by a Man corrupt And partial in his Censure. Archid. Note his Language; It relishes of better Breeding than His present State dares promise. Timol. I observe it.â Seat the fair Lady in the Midst, that both, Looking with covetous Eyes upon the Prize They are to plead for, may, from the fair Object, Teach Hermes Eloquence. Leost. Am I fall'n so low; My Birth, my Honour, and what's dearest to me, My Love, and Witness of my Love, my Service, So undervalu'd, that I must contend With one, where my Excess of Glory must Make his O'erthrow a Conquest? Shall my Fulness Supply Defects in such a Wretch, that never Knew any Thing but Want and Emptiness? Give him a Name, and keep it such from this Unequal Competition. I now turn to you, Ungrateful Fair One, and since you are such, 'Tis lawful for me to proclaim my self, And what I have deserv'd. Cleora. Neglect and Scorn From me, for this proud Vaunting. Leost. You nourish, Lady, Your own Dishonour in this harsh Reply, And almost prove what some hold of your Sex, That you are made up of Passion: For if Reason Or Judgment could find Entertainment with you, I should not need to plead for that, which you With Joy should offer.âIs my high Birth a Blemish, Or does my Wealth, which all the vain Expence Of Women cannot waste, breed Loathing in you? The Honours I can call my own, thought Scandals? If you interpret these As Crimes, 'tis fit I should yield up my self Most miserably guilty: But, perhaps, (Which yet I would not credit) you have seen This Fellow pitch the Bar, or bear a Burden Would crack the Shoulders of a weaker Bond-man. Archid. You are foul-mouth'd. Cleora. Ill-manner'd too. Leost. I speak In the Way of Supposition, and intreat you With all the Fervour of a constant Lover, That you would free your self from these Aspersions, Or any Imputation black-tongu'd Slander Could throw on your unspotted Virgin Whiteness, To which there is no easier Way, than by Vouchsafing him in your Favour: Him, to whom Next to the Gods, and to the General, The Country owes her Safety. Timag. Are you stupid? Slight, leap into his Arms, and there ask Pardon.â Oh! you expect your Slaves Reply: no doubt We shall have a fine Oration: I will teach My Spaniel to howl in sweeter Language, And keep a better Method. Archid. You forget The Dignity of the Place. Diph. Silence! Timol. Speak boldly. Pisand. 'Tis your Authority gives me a Tongue, I should be dumb else; and as I am secure, I cannot cloath my Thoughts and just Defence In such an abject Phrase, but 'twill appear Equal, if not above my low Condition. I bring with me No Wealth to boast of; neither can I number Uncertain Fortune's Favours with my Merits: How I have lov'd, and how much I have suffer'd, And with what Pleasure undergone the Burden Of my ambitious Hopes, with my Confession Of my own Wants, is all that can plead for me. But if that pure Desires may be thought Worthy Acceptance, then I dare rise up And tell this gay Man to his Teeth, I never Durst doubt her Constancy, that, like a Rock Beats off Temptations, as that mocks the fury Of the proud Waves: Nor from my jealous Fears Question that Goodness, to which, as an Altar Of all Perfection, he that truly loves Should rather bring a Sacrifice of Service, Than raze it with the Engines of Suspicion: Of which, when he can wash an Ãthiope white, Leosthenes may hope to free himself; But 'till then, never. Timag. Bold, presumptuous Villain! Pisand. I will go farther, and make good upon him, In the Pride of all his Honours, Birth, and Fortunes, He's more unworthy than my self. Leost. Thou lyest. Timag. Confute him with a Whip; and the Doubt decided, Punish him with a Halter. Pisand. Oh! the Gods! My Ribs, tho' made of Steel, cannot contain My Heart, swoln big with Rage.âThe Lye! Whip? [Plucks off his Disguise. Let Fury then disperse these Clouds, in which I long have mask'd, disguis'd; that when they know Whom they have injur'd, they may faint with Horror Of my Revenge, which wretched Men expect As sure as Fate to suffer.âKnow then, I am no more Marullo, but Pisander! Leost. Ha! Pisander! Timag. 'Tis the bold Theban! Asot. There's no Hope for me then: I thought I should have put in for a Share, And borne Cleora from 'em both; but now This Stranger looks so terrible, that I dare not So much as look on her. Pisand. Now as my self, Thy Equal at the best, Leosthenes.â For you, Timagoras, praise Heav'n, you were born Cleora's Brother; 'tis your safest Armour.â But I lose Time.âThe base Lye cast upon me I thus return: Thou art a perjur'd Man, False and perfidious, and hast made a Tender Of Love and Service to this Lady, when Thy Soul (if thou hast any) can bear Witness That thou wert not thy own.âFor Proof of this, Look better on this Virgin, and consider This Persian Shape laid by, and she appearing In a Greekish Dress, such as when first you saw her, If she resemble not Pisander's Sister, One call'd Statilia? Leost. 'Tis the same! My Guilt So choaks my Spirits, I cannot deny My Falshood, nor excuse it. Pisand. This is she To whom thou wert contracted: This the Lady, That when thou wert my Prisoner fairly taken In the Spartan War, that begg'd thy Liberty, And with it gave herself to thee, ungrateful! Timand. No more, Sir, I intreat you: I perceive True Sorrow in his Looks, and a Consent To make me Reparation in mine Honour, And then I am most happy. Pisand. The Wrong done her Drew me from Thebes with full Intent to kill thee: But this fair Object met me in my Fury, And quite disarm'd me.âBeing deny'd to have her By you, my Lord Archidamus, and not able To live far from her, Love (the Mistress of All quaint Devices) prompted me to treat With a Friend of mine, who as a Pirate sold me For a Slave to you my Lord, and gave my Sister As a Present to Cleora. Timol. Strange Meanders! Pisand. There how I have born my self needs no Relation. But if so far descending from the Heighth Of my then flourishing Fortunes, to the lowest Condition of a Man, to have Means only To feed my Eye with the Sight of what I honour'd; The Dangers too I underwent; the Suff'rings; The Clearness of my Interest may deserve A noble Recompence in your lawful Favour.â Now 'tis apparent that Leosthenes Can claim no Interest in you; you may please To think upon my Service. Cleor. Sir, my want Of Power to satisfy so great a Debt, Makes me accuse my Fortune; but if that Out of the Bounty of your Mind, you think A free Surrender of my self full Payment, I gladly tender it. Archid. With my Consent too, All Injuries forgotten. Timag. I will study In my future Service to deserve your Favour And good Opinion. Leost. Thus I gladly see This Advocate to plead for me. Pisand. You will find me An easy Judge: When I have yielded Reasons Of your Bond-mens falling off from their Obedience, Then after, as you please, determine of me. I found their Natures apt to mutiny From your too cruel Usage, and made Trial How far they might be wrought on; to instruct you To look with more Prevention and Care To what they may hereafter undertake Upon the like Occasions.âThe Hurt's little They have committed; nor was ever Cure But with some Pain effected. I confess, In hope to force a Grant of fair Cleora, I urg'd them to defend the Town against you: Nor had the Terror of your Whips, but that I was preparing for Defence elsewhere, So soon got Entrance.âIn this I am guilty, Now, as you please, your Censure. Timol. Bring them in; And tho' you have giv'n me Power, I do intreat Such as have undergone their Insolence, It may not be offensive, tho' I study Pity more than Revenge. Coris. 'Twill best become you. Cleon. I must consent. Asot. For me, I'll find a Time To be reveng'd hereafter. Enter Poliphron, Gracculo, Cimbrio, Zanthia, and the other Slaves, with Halters about their Necks. Grac. Give me Leave, I'll speak for all. Timol. What can'st thou say to hinder The Course of Justice? Grac. Nothing.âYou may see We are prepar'd for Hanging, and confess We have deserv'd it. Our most humble Suit is We may not twice be executed. Timol. Twice? How mean'st thou! Grac. At the Gallows first, and after in a Ballad Sung to some villainous Tune. There are Ten groat Rhimers About the Town, grown fat on these Occasions.â Let but a Chapel fall, or a Street be fir'd, A foolish Lover hang himself for pure Love, Or any such like Accident, and before They are cold in their Graves, some damn'd Ditty's made Which makes their Ghosts walk.â Let the State take Order For the Redress of this Abuse, recording 'Twas done by my Advice; and for my Part I'll cut as clean a Caper from the Ladder, As ever merry Greek did. Timol. Yet I think You would shew more Activity to delight Your Master for a Pardon. Grac. Oh! I would dance, As I were all Air and Fire. Timol. And ever be Obedient and Humble. Grac. As his Spaniel, Tho' he kick'd me for Exercise; and the like I promise for all the rest. Timol. Rise then, you have it. All Slaves. Timoleon! Timoleon! Timol. Cease these Clamours.â And now the War being ended to our Wishes, And such as went the Pilgrimage of Love, Happy in full Fruition of their Hopes, 'Tis lawful Thanks paid to the Pow'rs Divine, To drown your Cares in honest Mirth and Revels. A Dance. Cleor. From a stern Master's Bonds you now are free, How will you bear agen new Chains with me? Pisand. In fair Cleora's Chains is Liberty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A SONG. Sung by the Slaves in the Second Act. I. Now let the chearful Glass go round, And brisk Falernian Wine abound: The Lovers Pains, The Tyrants Chains Are quite forgot, and in our Cares are drown'd. II. The Slave, with sprightly Wine elate, Laughs at his Master's haughty State. Then drink about, We'll see it out, And smile at the Cares of the Day: We'll wish for Success, And hope Happiness, There's nothing, no, nothing to Pay. FINIS.</field>
