      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Lara Mr. SWIFT. Marquis Mr. FORBES. Antonio Mr. TERROTT. Fabio Mr. ARTHUR. A Lord Mr. H. CORRI. Lambro Mr. G. HONEY. Ezzelin Mr. RENWICK. Countess de Flor Miss ROMER. Casilda Miss COTTERELL. Helena Madame BURRINGTON. Kaled Miss LOUISA PYNE. Conductor Signor ARDITI.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âAt the back, L., Lara's Ancient Castle. An entrance gate approached by some steps cut in the rock, and overgrown by brushwood. Casilda's Cottage to the R. R., U. E., a path descending to the cliff. To the left, an old fountain. In the back-ground, the sea and sky. The curtain rising, the Marquis and several Young Nobles dressed in a rich hunting costume enter from L. and R. INTRODUCTION. Cho. Gallant friendsâ While all the world is sleeping, What delight to behold The early sunbeams peeping, That tinge the east with gold; While the vaulted sky is dimly lighted With the morn's newest glow, O'er hill and vale excited, With renewed strength to go. All bright we see before us, With hearts that cannot ache, Haste we in lusty chorus Loud echoes to awake. While all, &amp;c. Mar. Stay awhile: this, unless my practised eyes deceive me, Is Lara's ancient wall; We shall find, friends, believe me, A welcome in this hall. Cho. That's good, a slight collation, Without procrastination, Will suits us very well. Mar. At once I'll ring the bell! [The Marquis ascends the steps with difficulty, and pulls the chain that hangs from the castle wall. The dull sound of a bell is heard. After a pause, Lambro appears. Lam. Who are you? What has brought you here? Cho. Ah, the owl watching o'er the owlet's nest, 'tis clear. Mar. The well-known friends are we of your most noble mistress, Of the Countess de Flor. Lam. Then go your way at once. Mar. Fine manners! what a boor! Unbar the portal, Scoundrel, thou slave accurst! Or, as I'm mortal, Through bolts and bars and everything I'll burst! Lam. (re-appears with arquebuss) Go back, or I shall fireâ Mar. Hang him, he dares refuse us! Cho. Ha, ha, ha! His harsh discourtesies amuse us. Come, Marquis, laugh with all the rest: That plan's the wisest and the best. While all, &amp;c. [Antonio and Casilda are seen coming from the farm. Casilda carries a basket of fruit on her head, and a pitcher of milk in her hand. Antonio carries a wine-skin. They stop with surprise on seeing the party of Lords. Mar. By this young pair, no doubt, we now shall be enlightened. Ant. &amp; Cas. What brought these strangers here? they're noble, by their air. Mar. Come this wayâyou need not be frightened! You know the surly rascal, within the castle, there? Ant. &amp; Cas. He is our master, sirs, an' please you. Cas. To him this fruit I take. Ant. And I this skin of wine. Mar. Nay, soon of your load will we ease you: Wine and fruit for that churl, very fine! mighty fine! Cho. Seize on the booty Thrown in our way! Pleasure is duty, My friends, to day. Cas. Gentlemen, what do you intend, pray? Ant. Be stillâdon't these nobles offend, pray. Just do what they say, without fuss. Cho. Sweet little peasant, Tremble not thus: This place is pleasant, And fit for us. [Pages go into the cottage, re-appear with stools, bowls, goblets, &amp;c. Ant. At your command is all our humble means can afford you. Cho. Thanks, good host, for your cheer. Mar. Trust me good friend, we'll well reward you. Cas. Would you be pleased a song to hear? Mar. Yes, very muchâyes her song we will hear. Cas. There, in yonder den, Shunned by honest men, Lives an old curmudgeon, Constantly in dudgeon; Like a wolf or bear, Crouched within his lair: Watch for ever keeping, Not a moment sleeping, Mad as any hare. But hush! he may hear! perchance he is peeping. When our noble count comes back That knave will dangleâalack! On a rope that is not slack. Cho. When the noble &amp;c. Cas. When 'tis dark he'll roam From his dreary home, Like a spectre, voiceless; Like a shadow, noiseless. Then he looks about, What would he seek out? Then the billows breaking, Awful noises making, Welcome him, no doubt; But hush!âhe may hearâwith fear I am quaking! Cho. When our, &amp;c. Enter Ezzelin. Ezz. Well, gentlemen. We appointed to meet each other at the old Castle Lara, and here I find you all in the open air. Mar. When people won't open the door, and threaten to blow our brains out if we approach it, our conduct is but natural. Ezz. But who dared do anything of the kind? Fab. A sort of gray-bearded maniac, who, it seems, is the intendant. Ezz. You have only to tell him that you are here by order of the Countess de Flor, noble heiress of the name and fortune of the Larasâ Ant. Wouldn't do, sir, wouldn't do! Cas. Bless you, you have no notion what a crusty old fellow that Lambro isâ Ezz. (to Antonio) And who may you be, who seem to know so much about him? Ant. Oh! I'm only a poor fisherman; and this is my intended. Cas. Yes; and I live with my mother in that cottage. Ezz. Very good. Then, of course, you know all the gossip of the place. Is it true that the direct heir of the Laras suddenly disappeared in a mysterious way, and that no one knows what has become of him? Cas. Quite true, an please you, sirâand they do say, that the old lord died of grief shortly afterwards. Ant. He didâimmediately after his death, old Lambro, that's the intendant, sir, sent away all the servants, barricaded all the doors, andâandâah! it's now a good six years since he allowed anyone to enter the castleâ Cas. But he has not left off collecting the rents and dues; and from time to time we have to take him all sorts of supplies, just as you saw. Mar. Now what shall we do to amuse ourselves till the arrival of the Countess? Suppose we have a sail on the sea? All. Ay, ay! Mar. That's settled. Get the boats ready as fast as you can, my good fellow, and you'll have a handful of ducats. You'll come with us, Ezzelin? [Exeunt Antonio and Casilda. Ezz. Certainly! but first let me tell you a piece of news. The King insists that the Countess de Flor shall instantly choose a husband, and promises to invest the happy man with the name and title of the Count of Lara. Mar. And that is why she comes here, with all her suite. Before she takes unto herself a lord and master, she will infuse a little gaiety into the old castle. Ezz. The Countess choose a husband! Do not a few of your hearts swell with hope and ambition? Mar. In some cases, perhaps, spiced with a little jealousy. Who knows? At this grand festival the jingle of glasses may be mixed with the clash of swords. Ezz. No, no; we agree to abide by her choice, if she chooses one of us. If she chooses some one else, I'll take upon myself the duty of avenging you all. Mar. Capital. Ezzelin for ever! Ezz. Nay, rather say âCamilla for ever,â Camilla, Countess de Flor! ROMANCEâEzzelin. Her eyes' bright glancesâon us fall, Pleased, she entrancesâconquers all; Charms she possessesâall hearts to move, Never professesâany to love. Whom will she choose at last? That sir, nobody guesses. When her choice we see, Loyal subjects we Will obedient be. The happy man, by her selected, By all of us shall be respected, To this we solemnly agree. That face beguilingâknown too well, Secretly, smilingâseems to tell Him, who is fatedâthat heart to win; Whom Heav'n has matedâonce she has seen, Seen him in some bright dream. She long for him has waited. When her choice we see, &amp;c. Re-enter Antonio and Casilda. Ant. My lords, the boats are ready, if you please. Mar. Good; there's for your trouble! (Flings him a purse.) Now, gentlemen, for the sea breezes! [Exit Ezzelin and the other Lords. Ant. Look here, Casilda. [Showing the purse. Cas. Why, I never saw so many bright ducats in my life! Ant. Let us count them as fast as we can. [As they sit, the Castle portal opens, and Lambro comes out, and, having reclosed the door, places himself before them. Cas. Ah! [They both rise. Lam. (Pointing to the remains of the repast, and seizing Antonio) What's the meaning of all this? Is this the way you pay your lord's dues? Cas. Please its no fault of mine, Master Lambro. Ant. Those audacious young lords took everything by main force. Lam. Ah! and by main force thrust that purse into your hands, eh? Well (snatches it from Antonio), that will go towards the damage. Cas. (whispering to Antonio) You let it go without a word. You call yourself a man! Why didn't you cry âthievesâ? Ant. I willâI willâI'm not afraidâ Cas. No more am Iâ Ant. Suppose you begin, then. Lam. Come here, my young friendsâhere, I sayâ(they both approach him, trembling) âpeople are getting very merry in these partsâthey make funny songs. Ant. (aside) He overheard. Cas. The terrible old fox! Lam. I'm no great judge of poetry, but I call this very prettyâ [Singing. âWhen our noble Count comes back.â What's the rest of it? Ant. I'm sure I've not a notion. Cas. Nor I. Lam. Let me try again then. [Sings. âWhen our noble Count comes back, Married you'll be in a crack, But surely not beforeâalack!â Cas. Oh what a horrid songâwhat does it mean? Lam. Just what it saysâthat without the permission of our lord and master you can't be married, my little dears. Cas. But he's awayâ Lam. Therefore you must wait till he comes back. Ant. But suppose he never returns at all. Lam. Rely upon it, he'll return some day or other. Cas. Could you give the slightest notion when the day will be? Lam. Unhappilyâno! Ant. That's lively. Cas. Perhaps when the day does come, it will find me an old maidâthere will be a shocking thing! Lam. Enough of this trifling. (To Antonio) You come along with meâ Ant. Where? Lam. To scrape what I can out of the farmersârascals like yourself âwho never bring anything of their own accord; as for you, you little slut, get the best fruit you can, I am resolved that to-night's supper shall be the most splendid we have had yet. Cas. Oh, what an appetite he has! [Exit into cottage. Lam. Now, make haste! (Antonio runs.) Softly, softly, not so fast. [Follows Antonio, and both exeunt during the symphony of the following. Enter the Countess, Helena, Ladies and Pages; they slowly come up by the path; the Ladies followed by the Attendants. CHORUS OF WOMEN, AND COUNTESS. Cho. Oh, I'm tired of toiling, moiling! Oh, I faint by heat oppressed! How the sun is burning, broiling! Let me, please, a moment rest? Cou. Here what pleasures meet me, Here a land beloved I view, Here the billows greet me, Here the sky is clear and blue. Heav'n my heart is filling, Hushed is earthly strife; Through my pulse is thrilling Newly waken'd life. Hel. This old castle here, Is to Heaven too near. Cou. Here what pleasures, &amp;c. Hel. Oh, I thought that I Certainly should die. [The Ladies seat themselves in various groups; then Attendants shade them with parasols and fan them. Casilda comes from cottage and seems astonished. Hel. Goodness gracious, what a road! If I had known that we were to get out of our litters at the foot of this mountain, I would never have come. I, lady of honour to the Queen, to be fatigued in this vulgar way! Cou. Never mind, dear Helena, the castle is reached at last. Hel. Oh! that's the wonderful castle you are so fond of telling about. Why, it looks exactly like a state prison! Cou. You'll not say so when you have seen the inside of it. Hel. Then let us enter it, by all means; a little shade will be refreshing. Cas. (who has gently come forward) No! I cannot be mistaken. Cou. Who is this? Cas. Donna Camilla! Cou. Not my playmate, Casilda? Cas. The very same! Cou. How delightful! When I look at you, I fancy I'm a child once more. Hel. Ah! now we shall have a string of old reminiscences. We shall never get out of the sun. Cou. Does all remain as when we were last together: your mother, and the little pet goats, and the boy-sweethearts? Cas. My mother, thank heaven, is still alive; the goats have grown old; and the boy-sweethearts are men, who, with one exception, have all deserted me. Cou. And one is still constant? That's quite enough, believe me. By the bye, is old Lambro still alive? Cas. Alive and active, too active sometimes. He has just gone into the village. Ah! no doubt he saw you ascending, for here he is. [Returns to cottage. Re-enter Lambro. Hel. Gracious goodness, is that a ghost? Cou. Dear old Lambro! Do I see you again? Lam. (repelling her) Who are you? Cou. What! don't you remember me? Lam. No. Cou. I'm Camilla. Lam. What's that to me? I want no Camillas. Cou. You have not forgotten that little girl who grew up under your own eyes, the motherless child, who was betrothed with great pomp to her cousin, Juan de Lara, your master's son and heir? Lam. No, no! I have not forgotten. When the son, heaven forgive him, had left his father, and when the father, broken by age and grief, had joined his ancestors beneath the chapel, the young girl of whom you speak went off by the Queen's orders in a fine carriage, and I was left alone within the old walls. Ah! that's ten years ago. I have not forgotten. Nay, I now remember that the same young girl, though I have often dandled her in my arms, has never bestowed upon me so much as a single thought. Cou. Lambro! Lam. What is it now? Cou. I want you to forgive me, and kiss me, as in the dear old times. Lam. Not I. Cou. As in the old times, Lambro, when you used to lift me from the ground, and I put my arms round your neck so. [Does so; after some hesitation Lambro kisses her. Hel. Good! peace is signed; and now I trust we shall be admitted within the enemy's walls. Lam. And now, farewell. Cou. No, no; you sha'n't leave me in this way, and you sha'n't live alone any longer. Lam. What! you'll return to the old home of your childhood, and, like me, pray for the master's return? Cou. How often have I prayed for it already! But hope is dead at last. Lam. Not with me, not with me; the ancient name of Lara is too noble to perish. Cou. You are right there; it will shine again with all its lustre. Lam. Indeed! by whom is the lustre to be restored? Cou. By the husband of my choice. Lam. Your choice? Cou. Yes, the King commands me to choose a husband. Lam. And a stranger is to bear the ancient name of Lara? No, no, it cannot be; you only say this to try if the old heart is still faithful. Cou. What I say is perfectly true, Lambro. Lam. Then, young woman, you may return whence you came. Hel. The good gentleman won't let us all perish outside the walls? Cou. Lambro; you forget yourself. This castle belongs to me, and I command you to throw open the gate without delay. Follow me, ladies. Lam. No, my pretty birds of passage, do nothing of the kind. CONCERTED PIECE. Lam. Watch for ever keeping, Here I'm always found; Not an instant sleeping, Like a faithful dog do I prowl around. Nought of good or evil, Neither lord or lass, Neither king nor devil, None, in spite of me, shall this threshold pass. Cou. Think of our condition, Our position, Lambro, friend, please to hear. Hel. See we are weeping. Lam. Waste your breath you need not, Tears I do not mind; Women's wiles I heed not, To the sex I'm deaf, stony-hearted, blind. Nought of, &amp;c. [He re-enters the castle, and at the end of the symphony closes the door. Hel. My hour is come. Cas. (re-appearing at door of cottage) Perhaps, ladies, as old Lambro refuses to open the gate, you'll condescend to rest yourself in my humble cottage. At all events, you'll find shelter fresh milk, delicious fruit and a hearty welcome. Cou. Decidedly, the kind offer is accepted. [Exeunt all into cottage. Lara and Kaled appear at the back. The former supports the latter, who appears exhausted. DUET.âLara and Kaled. Lara. My native land, again receive me, And let all thought of wand'ring leave me; Blest home which my sires called their own. The heart of childhood once more give me, All the joy now too long unknown. Kal. No native home will now receive me, But yet thy joy I share, believe me; Oh, may peace now to thee be known, While thou art near me, nought shall grieve me, For my heart will be all thine own. Lara. My faithful boy, look up, light-hearted, Our troublous days have now departed. Kal. Thou wilt find many friends most dear, While, good master, none know me here. Lara. Nay, boy, not a friend will appear, No kindly face will beam to meet me; None in this place think upon me now; Hither I come, a stranger, e'en as thou. But what matter, the billows greet me, And the sky, and the winds, and the forest around, To welcome my return, all with life now abound. Lara. (leading Kaled to fountain) Here is a cool, shady place; rest yourself. [Kaled sits down. Kal. Ah, this is delightful! How pleasantly the breeze scatters away the leaves. What beautiful flowers grow in your country! Give me that one; that looks like a silver bell. (Lara gives it.) Now, farewell for ever to the African land. I have gathered a flower on the stranger's soil, and here I must live, love, and die. [Closes his eyes. Lara. Sleep, boy, sleep; I will watch over you. Kal. Yes, and in my turn I will watch over you, always, always. [Falls asleep. Lara. How calm he looks! Happy are they who can sleep like that! Enter Countess and Casilda from cottage. Cou. (to Casilda) Now, Casilda, mind you assemble as many of your young friends as you can. I wish to know them all, and to teach them all to love the Countess of Lara. [Casilda returns into cottage. Lara. The Countess of Lara! Cou. A stranger! Lara. Lady, I am a soldier, who, after a long captivity, returns to the land of his fathers. Cou. But that singular dress! Whence have you come? Lara. From the coast of Africa. Cou. And the boy sleeping there? Lara. He is a child of the desert. Cou. A Christian? Lara. No; I found him in a cottage that had been set on fire, and he has never quitted me since. Cou. Has he no parents or relations? Lara. They are dead. Cou. Poor child! (Approaches Kaled.) What a charming face he has! Kal. (Waking, flies to Lara) Master, what does that woman want? Cou. This woman will be your friend, if you will allow her. Kal. Who are you? Cou. The heiress of this domain, and the mistress of yonder castle, where, indeed, I was born. Lara. (aside) 'Tis Camilla! Kal. The mistress of yonder castle. Have you no master, then? Cou. Not yet; but I am about to have a very terrible master indeed. This very evening I must choose a husband. Lara. Must, madam? Cou. Yes, even so. I must obey the order of the King. Kal. Obeyâah!âthen you love someone you may not choose? Cou. I scarcely know whether to say yes or no. I love a remembranceâa dreamâa shadowâone whom I have expected for many years, and whose name makes my heart tremble whenever it is uttered. Kal. Ah! when they are deserted by those they love, the women of my country die. Come, master, come. Lara. Nay, child, not so fast; whither would you go? Kal. Whither my master orders me. Cou. Suppose I begged him to intrust you to me? Kal. Master! master! [Clings to Lara. Lara. (pressing Kaled's hands) No, he cannot leave meâhis life is linked with mine. Kal. When the Arab accepts service in the desert, he chooses a star to protect and guide him. I have my starâcome! TRIOâCountess, Lara, Kaled. Cou. Since we must bid farewell, May all good fortune bless you; No thought of ill distress you, But hope within you dwell. Lara &amp; Kal. Yes, we must bid farewell, May all good fortune bless you; No fear for us distress you, Within us hope will dwell. Cou. So much beauty! When I behold theeâ Hapless boyâI could almost weep. Lara. Fairest lady, may heaven enfold thee Within its arms, and safely keep. Kal. (looks at Lara) What, my heart, have those glances told thee? Plainly they speak of feelings deepâ What mean those thoughts my soul alarming? Cou. How fixed is his look. Lara. (aside, passionately) She is charming. Cou. Since we, &amp;c. Lara &amp; Kal. Yes, we &amp;c. [Lara and Kaled exeunt, the Countess looks after them. FINALE. Chorus of Peasants. Love and pleasure hover near thee, As thou comest, lady fair; See, the spring returns to cheer thee, And its music fills the air. Chorus of Nobles. Your eyes like fetters bind us, Yet would we not escape their charm; Most willing slaves you find usâ Your own with heart and arm. Cou. With thanks, my dearest friends, I scantily repay you. Welcome, brave cavaliers, I bid you welcome all. Nob. Fair lady, at your feet most loyally we fall, And feel most proud when vowing humbly we'll obey you. Cou. These ancient hills, so desolate, They seem some dreadful mystery concealing; With merry sounds of pleasure filling, Our glad return, dear subjects celebrate. Cho. Soon these halls, your presence feeling, Will no more be desolate; With the sounds of welcome pealing, Your return they'll celebrate. Mar. Indeed, we are not here too soon, a storm is rising. Cou. Advance, my lord, all obstacles despising. Ezz. Give the word, soon the gate shall yawn. Cou. Noble friends, leave I freely give you, with all due form, At once to take the place by storm. Cho. Dear Marquis, leave you hear her give you, Now the place by storm to take! No more of hesitationâ By force, negociation, Or e'en annihilation, An entrance you must make. Mar. Yonder castle shall soon receive you. Chorus of P. Wait awhile! there in yonder tow'r Died our lord; thence comes streaming, Once a year, about this hour, A light through the dull windows beaming. [The window becomes lighted. All. Behold, even now it is beaming From yon ancient tow'r. Ant. Silence all, some one comes! [Lambro appears at the entrance of the Castle, with a torch in his hand. Lam. Ye nobles, knights and peasants there, The Count of Lara bids me courteously declare To his castle you are invited, To see you he will be delighted. He's here, he is here, And I can promise hearty cheer. Cho. Ah! he's mad, poor wretch, poor devil! Else he would not be so civil. Ha! ha! ha! ha! Lam. My master waitsâaccept his invitation without fear. Hel. Gracious lady, let's escape the lightning, rain and thunder. Cou. (advancing) Well, be't so. Ezz. (to Marquis) Dearest friend, prithee, what means this wonder? Cho. Where'er he leads, we'll gladly go. Cas. Wilt come, poltroon? Ant. Oh, no; oh, no. [Lambro, torch in hand, enters castle, followed by Ezzelin and the Countess, then the rest in order, the storm breaks out The Orchestra takes up the air âWhen our noble Count comes back.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. Cho. Gallant friendsâ While all the world is sleeping, What delight to behold The early sunbeams peeping, That tinge the east with gold; While the vaulted sky is dimly lighted With the morn's newest glow, O'er hill and vale excited, With renewed strength to go. All bright we see before us, With hearts that cannot ache, Haste we in lusty chorus Loud echoes to awake. While all, &amp;c. Mar. Stay awhile: this, unless my practised eyes deceive me, Is Lara's ancient wall; We shall find, friends, believe me, A welcome in this hall. Cho. That's good, a slight collation, Without procrastination, Will suits us very well. Mar. At once I'll ring the bell! [The Marquis ascends the steps with difficulty, and pulls the chain that hangs from the castle wall. The dull sound of a bell is heard. After a pause, Lambro appears. Lam. Who are you? What has brought you here? Cho. Ah, the owl watching o'er the owlet's nest, 'tis clear. Mar. The well-known friends are we of your most noble mistress, Of the Countess de Flor. Lam. Then go your way at once. Mar. Fine manners! what a boor! Unbar the portal, Scoundrel, thou slave accurst! Or, as I'm mortal, Through bolts and bars and everything I'll burst! Lam. (re-appears with arquebuss) Go back, or I shall fireâ Mar. Hang him, he dares refuse us! Cho. Ha, ha, ha! His harsh discourtesies amuse us. Come, Marquis, laugh with all the rest: That plan's the wisest and the best. While all, &amp;c. [Antonio and Casilda are seen coming from the farm. Casilda carries a basket of fruit on her head, and a pitcher of milk in her hand. Antonio carries a wine-skin. They stop with surprise on seeing the party of Lords. Mar. By this young pair, no doubt, we now shall be enlightened. Ant. &amp; Cas. What brought these strangers here? they're noble, by their air. Mar. Come this wayâyou need not be frightened! You know the surly rascal, within the castle, there? Ant. &amp; Cas. He is our master, sirs, an' please you. Cas. To him this fruit I take. Ant. And I this skin of wine. Mar. Nay, soon of your load will we ease you: Wine and fruit for that churl, very fine! mighty fine! Cho. Seize on the booty Thrown in our way! Pleasure is duty, My friends, to day. Cas. Gentlemen, what do you intend, pray? Ant. Be stillâdon't these nobles offend, pray. Just do what they say, without fuss. Cho. Sweet little peasant, Tremble not thus: This place is pleasant, And fit for us. [Pages go into the cottage, re-appear with stools, bowls, goblets, &amp;c. Ant. At your command is all our humble means can afford you. Cho. Thanks, good host, for your cheer. Mar. Trust me good friend, we'll well reward you. Cas. Would you be pleased a song to hear? Mar. Yes, very muchâyes her song we will hear. Cas. There, in yonder den, Shunned by honest men, Lives an old curmudgeon, Constantly in dudgeon; Like a wolf or bear, Crouched within his lair: Watch for ever keeping, Not a moment sleeping, Mad as any hare. But hush! he may hear! perchance he is peeping. When our noble count comes back That knave will dangleâalack! On a rope that is not slack. Cho. When the noble &amp;c. Cas. When 'tis dark he'll roam From his dreary home, Like a spectre, voiceless; Like a shadow, noiseless. Then he looks about, What would he seek out? Then the billows breaking, Awful noises making, Welcome him, no doubt; But hush!âhe may hearâwith fear I am quaking! Cho. When our, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âA Magnificent Corridor, closed in at the back by large heavy curtains. Lambro, Pages and Valets. Lam. Now, this way all of youâthis way. Let every one do his best, in his own place. The master is at home again. Room for the suite of the noble Marquis. Room for the Countess's pages. Enter the Marquis, Fabio and Lords, then Ezzelin. Mar. Really, gentlemen, one surprise follows so close upon another, that I begin quite to like this old castle. Fab. As for that old Lambro, the man is politeness itself. Mar. Yes, and madness itself. Mar. That Count of Lara, we'll believe in him when we see him. Ezz. You can remain in doubt. I feel no such consolation, certain that this man will crush all my hopes. Mar. I see, one of the old jealous moods. But here come the Countess and all her ladies. MORCEAU D'ENSEMBLE. Lad. How grand does all appear! What costly preparation! Lor. Wondrous infatuation! Fab. A truce to conversation! Wait in expectation, Now the hour draws near. Cou. How the time is creeping! How my heart is leaping! Still he does not come. Thou so long departed, Glad or weary hearted, Hast thou sought thy home? Ezz. For his approach she longs, observe her agitation! There's not a look for me. Mar. Excited do not be. Cho. Wondrous infatuation, &amp;c. Lam. The Count of Lara's here. Ezz. Not a word. He is here. Enter Count Lara, richly clad, leaning on Kaled's shoulder. Cou. How strange? Can it be? Is it he? Do I dream? Lords. At least we'll greet him fairly, and quite contented seem. Lara. You honour much these halls, long by their lord neglected, Noble ladies, and you young courtiers, this is kind, When first I touched the coast, but little I expected Thus greeting my return, so many friends to find. By pleasure here you are invited, (To Countess) Here, all your mandate must obey, Cou. I feel confused, alarmed, affrighted, I know not what to do or say. Lam. My lord returns, the hall is lighted. Again I'm young, again I'm gay. All the Others. How is it she is thus excited, Her looks some sudden joy betray. Lara. Now has come The hour to fill with joy once more my ancient home, This the palace, you all wished to see, That's well. So be it then, I pray you follow me. Drive away sadness, Here only gladness Henceforth shall reign; Beauty long banish'd, Joys that have vanish'd, Return again. CHORUS. With our songs, echoes waking, We'll drown the nightâ Till the day slowly breaking Steals on our feast with its light. E'en when creeping comes the pale morn, Rev'llers to warn; Shall we the warning mind? Our cups in our hands 'twill find, Ezz. Anguish deep as mine ne'er was borne. Henceforth but scorn I am condemn'd to find. To all beside him will she be blind. Lara. Songs of delight, Echoes awaking, Sing through the night, Till the day's breaking. E'en when at last Comes the pale morning, Heed not the warning, Hold pleasure fast. [Lara offers his hand to the Countess, and leads her off followed by the Lords and Ladies. Kaled, who is left with Lambro, looks after them. Lam. You are looking after your master, my pretty ladâare you not proud to devote your life to such a noble lord? Ah, if I was as young as you are, no one but me should carry his banner in the field, and buckle on his spurs for the battle. (Kaled coming forward, seats himself. When his father died in my arms, âLambro,â said he, âI forgive my prodigal son, and I appoint you the guardian of his inheritance.â Now look around you, see how this castle has been preserved in all its magnificence. Look round, boy, and you will understand why a tear dropped from Lara's eye, when he took me by the hand, and said, âThanks, faithful servant!â Kal. (aside) What does Conrad mean by all this? This name of Lara, these titles, this wealth. Why does he take them? Lam. Let me but live a few days longer. Let me see the court filled with proud coursers and stately equipages, let me see the priest at the altar, blessing the Count and his lovely bride. Kal. (rising) Hold! what do you mean by âbrideâ? Surely a man cannot marry a woman whom he does not love, whom he has not even seen. Lam. Ha, ha! you are too young to remember the past, or to distinguish the marks of love. Just listenâit is love, and nothing else, that brings our Count Juan home to his beautiful Camilla; it was love that made him take her hand. Kal. Oh, if this were true! Lam. Soon you'll see them avoid all the rest of the world, and take no delight in any company save their own. They will have but one thought, one heart, one soul. Kal. (aside) It cannot be! Lam. Then the wedding day will comeâand every lady, noble and simple, will come to honour the feast. Kal. (aside) I will hear no more. [Rushes off unperceived by Lambro. SONG AND TRIO. Lam. Ere long the merry bells shall ring, The peasants dance and sing, The wine, in darkness hidden, To sparkle will be bidden; A brave toping lot together we will bring. Ah, blessings on this day, this day of mirth and joy; Nought shall henceforth vex or grieve me; I am young again, believe me, I dance and laugh away like any mad-cap boy. Enter Antonio and Casilda Ant. Hey day! see Lambro dancing yonder, Cas. Has he lost his wits, I wonder? Lam. What, you, my worthy friends, come hither, do not fear, To night all's lawful here. Ant. What does he say? Cas. If everâ Both. So changed was mortal never. Lam. Ere long the cash shall chinkâ Sweet music as I think. Young lasses shall be married Who far too long have tarried. The poor like the rich shall eat and shall drink. Ah, blessings, &amp;c. Lam. Come, approach me, don't be afraid! Ant. Ha, ha! that's good, we never were. Lam. Here, blockhead! (Antonio shrinks back.) Here is your purse! Ant. (takes it, trembling) Indeed, you are kind enough to give it me back. Lam. You did not think I meant to keep it? Cas. (whispers) Perhaps it is empty. Ant. No, on the contrary, it feels heavier than before. Lam. As for you, child, since you are silly enough to wish to marry this numskull, here's something towards your dowry. [Puts some gold coins in her hand. Cas. (jumping with joy) Oh, look, look, Antonio! Lam. You don't feel any desire to hang me now. Ant. I! the first who dared lay hands on youâ Lam. You'd hang him instead, eh! Disinterested devotion! But make hasteâback, back, our young mistress is coming. Cas. Donna Camilla! Lam. Back, I say! [They hurry off, L. Enter Countess from the back, she holds her hand to Lambro, who bows, kisses it respectfully and retires, L. ROMANCE. Cou. To a far distant past That is fading away, My mem'ry still is cleaving fast, And fondly, sadly bids it stay; The visions of my early youth Within my heart appear to live; I may not doubt their truth, Such pure delight to me they give. Now from my soul's recesses break The thoughts there hidden long ago, And wond'rous forms they take, As with the light of heav'n they glow; The visions of my early youth Within my heart appear to live; I may not doubt their truth, Such pure delight to me they give. Enter Lara. Lara. (approaching her with eagerness) Camilla, my own Camilla! Cou. Yes, yes, 'tis indeed Lara! No doubt it was this form, which, living in my memory, made me take such an interest in the poor unknown soldier. I may now confess how desolate I felt when I bade him farewell. Lara. I, too, uttered that sad word with my lips, but it did not come from my heart. Having seen you arrayed in all your beauty, could I renounce the joy of seeing you again? you, my proud Camilla, proud of the victory that brings me to your feet! Cou. Then you had intended never to return? Lara. I had sworn to visit the land of my birth as a traveller who has performed a pilgrimage and then passes on. Then I did not know the power of beauty. I had still to learn that no one here below is master of his fate. It was when I had seen you that I entered the abode of my fathers. The titles, the treasures, that are my right had acquired a new value; I ventured to claim them that I might offer them to youâto you my beautiful bride. One treasure alone do I crave in returnâ Cou. Is it this? [Gives her hand. DUET, TRIOâLara and Countess. Both. Oh, rapture, joy beyond expression, Where the heart bids we must forgive; Oh, love, my soul is thy possession, Only for thee I wish to live. Cou. And thou at last art mine, long worshipp'd with devotion, The husband of my dreams is here. Lara. My senses all are drown'd in light as in an ocean, A dazzling flood does heav'n appear. Both. Oh, rapture, &amp;c. Lara. Soon before all the world My rank will I assume; The past, with all its gloom, To oblivion be hurled. Cou. (smiling) About that past there's something seriousâ It's secret soon you will reveal! Lara. That may not be. Cou. Why so mysterious? Wherefore seek the truth to conceal? Tell allânow at onceâ'tis my will. Lara. In pityâ Cou. Think not I deceive you, Tell all, or now, yes now I leave you. Lara. Camilla! Cou. Why turn your eyes away? Why grows your cheek so pale? 'Tis enough, leave me, pray. Lara. Nay why disturb so soon a dream so bright and charming, To-morrow, all, will I explain. Cou. Whate'er the secret be, no thought, my heart alarming, Shall make me question further. Here, take my hand again. Lara &amp; Cou. Oh, rapture, &amp;c. Kal. Oh, pain beyond expression! What wounds a word can give! I hear his fond confession, And wish no more to live. [Kaled lets the curtain fall and suddenly advances. Lara. Ah, Kaled! Cou. Dear boy, we had forgotten you! come to me nearer. (Tries to take his hand, Kaled withdraws it.) Are you afraid of me? Kal. (coldly) No! Cou. Then why shun me thus? Have the sages of your country taught you that the women in mine are false-hearted, and that there is danger in their friendship? Kal. Perhaps so! Cou. Look, Lara, how pale he turns! Lara. He is overcome with wonder at the marvels displayed before his eyesâat the sudden change. Kal. I am alarmed on your account. Lara. He thinks I am under the influence of some spell, and that a wave of the enchanter's wand will make all the splendour vanish. Calm yourself, dear Kaled, I have nothing to fear, if all whom I love remain faithful. Kal. Then I must fear for myself. Cou. Ah, he is jealous! He fears that your love for me will extinguish your friendship for him. Nay, boy, be not apprehensive. Lara will always be your brother, and I will be your sister. Kal. (eagerly) Let us go, master. Let me go! Lara. Go! Wherefore? Kal. You are rich now! Buy a ship, hire men and let them bear me away. I would leave this country that is not mine. I would return to the desert. Lara. No, no! You shall not quit me; you shall live in happiness here. Look at this mandora. They say that a Moorish captive gave it to one of the Laras in return for his hospitality. Like him, though not a captive, you will sit under the orange trees on the terrace, and when the stars are bright we will sing the songs of your country together. Cou. (taking the mandora) Yes, and you shall teach them to me, Kaled. [Gives the mandora to Kaled, who seats himself on the cushions. ARAB SONG. Kal. Where the planes their coolness shedding, O'er the caravans are spreading, Home has Hassan come at last. Ha, ha, ha! He has brought of gems the rarest, 'Tis a bride of brides the fairest; Oh, her smile was ne'er surpassed. At his feet she's calmly sleeping, Near the tent is Mirza creeping, Where the rocks their shadows cast. Where the planes, &amp;c. As the light gazelle descending, Through the air his pathway rending Comes the vulture, like the blast; Thus the knife of Mirza gleaming Smites the bride amid her dreaming, And the sleeper sleepeth fast. Where the planes, &amp;c. [At the last verse Kaled has fixed his eyes upon the Countess. Cou. (whispers to Lara) Lara, it is a woman! Lara. (leading off the Countess) This way, this way, I implore you! [Exit with Countess. Ezzelin appears at the back. Ezz. Together, again together! Kal. Mirza was a daughter of the desert. She loved a brave heart, andâandâwhy did Hassan love another? Ezz. Yesterday she listened to me, and answered my arrival with a smile, and nowâ(perceiving Kaled). Ha! you were here, near them. What did they say? Kal. Why should you desire to know? Ezz. Ah! you cannot understand the agony that presses upon my heart. That woman who was with your masterâthat woman, whose beauty enchants all who behold her. Hear me, boy, I love her, I worshipâ Kal. You! Ezz. Do you now comprehend what I suffer when I see that her whole heart is occupied with this Lara?âthis betrothed of her youth, whom the fates bring back to crush me! Kal. Yes, yes, I understand. Your blood boils, does it not, and your brain whirls? But tell me thisâin your country is a man dishonoured when he utters a lie? Ezz. There can be no deeper disgrace. Kal. Even if he utters it to a womanâeven if it is to make her believe that he is worthy of her? Ezz. Ay, even if she were as proud as Camilla. But go on, I implore you. Let me know if she really loves him; anything is better than this horrible doubt. EZZELIN AND KALED. Ezz. There is a poison leaps through the veins, Like fiercest flame the heart consuming, And its victim to madness dooming, 'Tis jealousyâthat worst of pains. Kal. There is, &amp;c. Ezz. Not an hour it ceases To torture its prey; Kal. Not an, &amp;c. Ezz. Time its power increases, Its course nought can stay. Kal. Time its, &amp;c. Both. With fury it fires us, With evil inspires us. Nought its course can stay. Kal. Listen. I, as well as you, am tormented by this serpent jealousy. Ezz. You! Whom, then, do you love? Kal. What matter, if my jealousy can serve yours. Ezz. I do not understand. [Shouts behind scenes, âLong live Lara! Long live Camilla!â Kal. Do you understand those shouts? Shouts in celebration of their happiness, for they do love each other. I heard the mutual avowal. Ezz. It is true, then? Kal. They speak of love even now. Ezz. 'Tis too horrible! Kal. Too long to remain silent. Ezz. What mean you? Kal. Follow me. and you shall learn. [Drags him behind tapestry. The curtains open, and discover a hall splendidly illuminated, at the back a staircase. Tables spread. Lara, Countess, &amp;c., and all the guests. FINALE. Moments of pleasure! Hours of delight! Seize on a treasure Swift in its flight. Shrinking from capture, Joy flits away, Moments of rapture Seize while ye may. Peasants. Long live our lord! Long remember this day! Cou. I believe in your words; still I have cause to fear, Although you love her not, she loves you, that I know. I shall ne'er have peace so long as she is here; Oh! to-morrowâto-nightâat once, pray let her go. Lara. It is your will, that must Kaled obey. Pea. Long live our lord! Long remember this day. Lara. All my rapture, dear friends, share this night, I implore you; See the Countess de Flor, your mistress, before you. Cou. Lo, I now my husband declare. All. Let us hail this noble young pair. Fab. Her choice we must approve. None can dispute its fitness. Why is Ezzelin absent? pray, where is he? where? Mar. He! the Countess's marriage, think you that he would witness? Lara. Take your seats, now the tables are spread, gay and free, Come drink; come singâwish every joy to me. Cho. Moments of pleasure, &amp;c. [During the above, two large tables have been superbly laid out. The Peasants dance during the chorus, and while the guests take their places. Lara. (rising, with a goblet in his hand) When Lara marched, the foeman braving, E'en his step all trembled to hear, The Moor who saw his banner waving, [Drinks. Would breathe a prayer half dumb with fear. My gallant fathers, bear in mind, And quaff the nectar which you find They left behind. [Hands cup to Lambro. Fill highâthe wine is Spanish, New strength it will impart, All sorrows it will banish, And warm the coldest heart. Cho. Fill high, &amp;c. Lara. When Lara chose a noble beauty, How her heart bounded with pride! The king performed a royal duty By complimenting Lara's bride. Fill high, &amp;c. Cho. Fill high, &amp;c. Enter Ezzelin. Ezz. Enough of mirth, of songs, and senseless noises! List to me, one and all; hushed awhile be your voices. Cho. What is this? Lara. Who dares to speak so loud? Lam. This, indeed, is but sorry breeding! Lara. To beard me in my hall! Strange, sir, is this proceeding. Ezz. Nay, you shall hear me speak, check me not, braggart proud. Aloud, before us all you shall declare This ancient castle not your own; No, not within its walls a single stone; That the title which now you bear You have usurped, a right to wear it cannot claim; That by fraud you now pretend From Lara's ancient lineage to descend, And wrongly here assume the Lara's honoured name! All. Oh, Heavens! Cou. &amp; Lam. I feel astounded! Lara. My lords, a madman raves, and you are all confounded. ENSEMBLE. Lara. They anger not me, These insults debasing, Their speaker disgracingâ My cheek retains its hue, you see. All. How altered is he! These insults debasing, Degrading, disgracing, Have blanched his cheek we plainly see. Cou. Come, reply! Ezz. Yes, reply! Lam. No, degrade yourself not thus, To such a churl reply not; He merits not your wrathâhis calumnies deny not, Let the creeping reptile at once be crushed by us. Ezz. To leave these halls to-morrow will you be commanded And to-morrow by me with true name be branded. Cou. With his name? Lar. 'Tis enough. Be it so. By my word! Lar. &amp; Ezz. We shall meet, and to-morrow argue with the sword. Cou. My fated love! Kal. To-morrow thenâwhat have I done? Lar. Let the feast proceed. Cou. I'm the sport of dreams indeed. Lar. Come, Lambro, faithful friend, fill the cup as of old, With the Lara's old wine, fill high my cup of gold. When Lara, deadly wrongs requiting, With his arm his honour defends, For him a strong ally is fighting, Yes, Heaven itself his cause befriends. Lam. The pain he feels he would disemble, Cou. &amp; Kal. Overcome by fear, I tremble. Cho. Fill up, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âA Chamber in the Castle. At the back, R., facing the audience, an alcove surrounded with curtains, and a bed on which Lara is lying. To the left is a window. Between the window and the door a large portrait of the old Count of Lara. To the right a small door, covered by tapestry. At the rising of the curtain Kaled enters by raising the tapestry, and approaches the alcove with a lamp. CONCERTED PIECE. Kal. Yes, all to him I'll tell, That I must, that I will; No more delay. This instantâ He sleeps; ah! that is well. Thy secret; oh, my heart preserve thy secret still! CAVATINA. From that dread past all wish to learn, May kindly slumbers set thee free, If Conrad should to life return, He'll live to be revenged on me. By me alone thou wert betrayed, Thy worst of foes was I, but yet A traitress I by love was made. Let my anguish thy vengeance be; Sleep, dearest, peacefully. (Spoken) Ah! what means that look of wild triumph? I see the past is not forgotten. This dream recalls the perils and pleasures of the corsair's life. [Lets fall the tapestry, then takes the lamp, looks once more towards Lara, and exit. Clouds cover the same. THE DREAM. [When the clouds are withdrawn, they discover a wild grotto on the sea-coast, lighted by the sun. Lara (as Conrad) reclines on silken cushions, while Almees and female captives dance to the guzla, played by Kaled (as Guinare). Corsairs grouped about the stage. Cho. Though clouds are black above us, Though the winds fiercely blow, There's nought to fear can move us, Bravely we onwards go. Joys, wealth, heaped without measureâ Corsairs ever are we; No law hinders our pleasure; Freedom dwells on the sea. Gul. Cease from fretting, cease regretting, You are ours, maidens dear; Bounding lightly, looking sprightly, Cast aside every fear; With your dances, with your glances, Strive your master's heart to cheer. Cho. Though clouds, &amp;c. Now we drink, now we fight, Merry rogues, men of might, Taking life as we may, We get through night and day. Con. (rising) Be merry, friends, it is your right, For to-day we repose, to-morrow we fight. AIR. To the bluest edge of ocean, Far as where the billows roll, Murmuring through their constant motion, As scorning the wind's control. So far our domains extend, boys, So far is our good ship known; While the laws the land defend, boys, The ocean is ours alone. All. The ocean is ours alone. Con. But see that tiny speck; what is it yonder beaming? Too slowly following night, perhaps it is a star, Perhaps it is some bird, that wings its way afar. Ah, no, a sail is gleaming. 'Tis an argosie Kindly Fortune sends us; Dear to her are we, Often she befriends us. Up against the sky Now our flag display, O'er the sea we fly To dart on our prey. The fight is fought, the prize is caught, Their coffers of gold reward well the bold. All. Their coffers of gold reward well the bold. Lara. Yes, my brave friends, the world like monarchs we sway! All must fear us, all revere us, And all must pay. All. Great is the pirate, all own his sway, All must fear him, all revere him, And all must pay. Lara. Now boldly we attack Some village in the night; The houses freely sack, The natives put to flight; Our pleasure is our duty; Where'er are wealth and beauty, We claim them as our ownâ The world is ours alone. Yes, my brave friends, &amp;c. Gul. Hist, hear that sound, the air is with its echo shaking, The cannon threatning thee, now its loud voice is waking. All. We'll follow thee once more to battle, Conrad, yet Before the fight begins, your former oath repeat. Con. If that oath I forget, At once all trample me beneath your feet; Still against all the world, war relentless declaringâ Ay, that world which like you I have quitted with scorn,â I'll cease to recollect the name which I have borne, For country, race and kin, no longer caring, I swear, while I have breath, Every lot with you sharing; My name Conrad shall be, I'm Conrad till my death. All. 'Tis well, our Conrad then we will obey till death. Gul. See a strange ship approaches, soon our island 'twill reach; Con. Then on, my gallant hearts, all hasten to the beach! All. Great is the corsair, &amp;c. [Conrad goes off at the head of his band. Gulnare left alone. The report of a cannon is heard, and she runs towards Conrad, who returns wounded, then sinks upon a rock, while Gulnare throws herself at his feet. [The scene of the Chamber is restored. Lara, with a wild shriek, rises in his bed and tears aside the curtain. Kaled re-appears, R. Lara. Kaled, friends, help! Kal. Here, here I am, dear master. Lara. Where am I? Whose voice is that? Kal. Do you not know Kaled? Lara. Oh, yes, of course. It was a dream, a terrible dream the same that pursues me always. Oh, that fatal past! Nothing can erase it from my memory. Kal. Not even the prayers of those that love you? Lara. Our rocks, my daring crew; my ship, the coffers over-flowing with gold and jewels. I have seen them all again; but in the midst of dance and revelry the cannon thunders, the sword flashes, the blood flows, and I sink dying into the arms of a young girl, a mere child. It was yourself. (Holds out his hand, which Kaled raises to his lips.) âMaster,â you said to me, âif fortune deserts your arms, you have still a country left. Come, Conrad, come. I alone possess your secret, and it shall be faithfully kept.â Kal. (aside, weeping) Base, base. Lar. Ah, my secret is known to one more (approaches portrait) and perhaps, father, before an hour has elapsed, he will have branded your name with infamy. Kal. His father! Have not my ears deceived me? (Seizes his hand). Conrad, your answer. That pictured old man, to whom you bowed your headâwas he indeed your father? Lara. Yes, Kaled, yes; that was the father whose love for me was at last worn out by a long course of misconduct. That was the father who, carried away by the blind passions of youth, I offended beyond the hope of pardon. The father whose curse I drew upon my head. This was his castle, the home which I quitted years ago, swearing that I would return to it no more. Kal. (aside) Oh, misery! Lara. Why did I break my oath? Why did I return now? Because there is an avenging heaven which has willed to chasten me. Kal. No, master, not you! me, me. Lara. You, Kaled! Kal. Call me not so; call me Gulnare, and accompany the name with a curse. Lara. Why child, why? Kal. Because it is I who betrayed Conradâwho revealed all to Ezzelin. Lara. You, you? viper in my bosom. [Raises dagger. Kal. (kneels) Yes, you were betrayed by me, by the child you made your companion, your friend. When, to follow you, I changed the attire of my sex, I thought I could as easily change my heart. I was a child then, and did not think that the child would become a woman. Ah, when I entreated you to let me depart, you ought to have understood me and feared me. You should have seen that a fire had taken possession of my soul. I betrayed you, Conrad, because I saw your love for another, and the sight was more than I could bear. I betrayed you, because I was mad, because I loved you and was jealous. Lara. (aside) Ah, it is I who have been the most ungratefulâ that I should never have discovered the meaning of that smile. Kal. Master, avenge yourself, kill me. Lara. (after a pause, raises her) No; rise, Gulnare, I pardon you. Kal. My Conrad, my love! [Rushes unto him, the sound of a distant trumpet is heard. Lam. (behind scenes). Let the banner of the Laras float from the summit of the donjon, let my lord's horse be got ready. Lara. At least I shall fight. [At these words enter Lambro with a sword and a casket. Lam. Ay, my noble lord, the good times have come again. Kal. Perhaps that man, that Ezzelin, may reveal the fatal truth to all. Lara. Be not alarmed, this good sword will not give him time. Lam. Ah! that was the sword wielded by your father, Count Manuel de Lara. I have seen it flash in twenty battles, and always on the side of truth and honour. Lara. Of truth and honour, on that side only. [Lays sword on table, and reflects. Kal. (aside) What is he doing? Lam. Now, Juan de Lara, in the presence of yonder portrait, which fixes its eyes upon us both, receive this treasure confided to my charge. (Presents casket.) Take this casket; it contains the titles and the signet of the Laras. I swore to place it in your hands, if Heaven granted your return. Here is the key. Lara. Good, good, leave me, both. (Kaled approaches him.) Both. (Exeunt Lambro and Kaled slowly.) How my hand trembles; do I fear to open the casket? perhaps it contains my father's pardon; nay, he drove me from his doors with curses. (Trumpets.) Ah, again signal! No matter for me; this little box contains a life. (Opens it, and draws out a parchment.) âJuan, my son, if Heaven brings you back a penitent to the home of your fathers, recollect that on our escutcheon there never was blot or blemish. I bequeath you my name, but bear it not if you have done aught to disgrace it. I bequeath you my sword, but rather break it than use it in an unjust cause, or to maintain a lie. This is the price of my forgiveness.â [Trumpets heard without at that signal. RECITATIVE AND BALLADâLara. Recitative. With my father's command I must, I will comply; I will strive, e'en in heav'n, his forgiveness to gain, And my wretched lot to bear I'll try. These words, these solemn words, all my rage must restrain. Ballad. Father, to me your will henceforth is sacred everâ Our ancient name by me shall be polluted never. I go! the scoffing world shall me alone despise; My task shall be fulfilledâthy pardon is the prize! Our arms adorn this ring, I'm not worthy to bear them; Their honour stainless yet, one less sullied shall wear them. I go, &amp;c. SCENE II. âThe Sea Beach. To the right the Castle of Lara. A ship moored to the shore. Ezzelin discovered standing at the back of the stage, with his hand on his sword. A page is near him, bearing his helmet and gauntlets. Marquis and other Nobles grouped to the right. A herald stationed on a rock, sounds a trumpet; the sound of which is answered by echoes. Countess, Helena, Ladies, Peasants. FINALE. Lam., Cou., Cho. &amp; Kal. Night has fled from daylight's warning; Yonder see thy foeman stand, Hither came he with the morning, And is waiting, sword in hand. Ezz. Night has fled at daylight's warning; Here thou see'st thy foeman stand, Come, or merit endless scorning, I await thee, sword in hand. Lam. (perceiving Lara) 'Tis he! Cou. To show that thou deserv'st my love, Thy vengeful arm no more restrain; At once the deadly stain remove, Or quit my sight, ne'er to return again. Lam. Time is pressing, let us not be slow. Cou. Ezzelin uttered falsehood, you swear. Lara. No, lady, no, The falsehood's mine. Cou. Great heav'ns! what dost thou say? Lara. Attend to me, attend, I pray. Aloud before you all, I do declare This ancient castle not my own; No, not within its walls one single stone. That the title which now I bear I have usurpedâa right to bear it cannot claimâ That by fraud I did pretend From Lara's ancient lineage to descend, And wrongly decked myself with Lara's honoured name. Cou. Oh heavens! Lam. My Lord! Lara. Nay, good Lambro, do not greet me so. Good old man I am not your masterânoâoh no! I have deceived you all, the Count of Lara's dead. ConradâConradâthe Corsair you behold: Lady, there's the secret: kept with dread. Now the truth, yes, the truth, to thee at last is told. Branded, this spot I leave, Laden with foul disgrace; Turn not aside thy faceâ One smile in mercy give. Lady, I bend before thee: Smile, smile, I do implore thee. ENSEMBLE, Cou. Thusâthus could he deceive? Though he's laden with disgrace, Still safely from this place Let him goâlet him live. Kal. Oh! dearest master, leave This unknown, unkindly race; There's hate in every face, Ne'er the wrong will they forgive. Lara. Why need I seek to live, Laden thus with foul disgrace? Branded a coward base, Ne'er myself shall I forgive. Ezz. Mar. &amp; Chorus. Bold only to deceive, Little heeding foul disgrace, Safe let him quit this place, Branded cowardâlet him live. Lam. Me can he not deceive: No! 'tis written in his face He's sprung from Lara's race, He's a Lara, I believe. Kal. I follow thee, Lam. I follow thee, Ezz. &amp; Cho. In safety now departâ Cou. Depart, without delay, forgiven by me thou art. Lara. My native land, once more I leave theeâ Blest home, my fathers called their own; Yet scarce a parting sigh I give thee, Gulnare, my heart is thine alone. [He enters the ship. Kal. Thou land of grief I gladly leave thee; Here nought but sorrow have I knownâ Henceforth, poor heart, no ill can grieve thee, For Conrad will be mine alone. Lam. Farewell, my native land, I leave thee, And wandering seek some land unknown; Yet scarce a parting sigh I give thee, For Lara do I live alone. Cou. Unhallow'd spot, I gladly leave thee, To me thou bringest grief alone; Goâgo in safetyâI forgive thee, Go, Conrad, for thy crimes atone. Ezz. &amp; Cho. Away, away, thy life we give theeâ Some country, where thy guilt's unknown, At last, in mercy, may receive thee; There, Conrad, for thy crimes atone.</field>
