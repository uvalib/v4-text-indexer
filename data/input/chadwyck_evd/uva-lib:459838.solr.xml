      <field name="fulltext">THE Vestal-Virgin, OR THE Roman Ladies. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Emilius, A Roman Senator of great Quality. Sertorius, One that had been a General; a brave Man, of a high Spirit. Sulpitius, His Brother, of a treacherous Nature. Mutius, One that had been a Lieutenant of a Province, a Lover of War. Artabaces, Prince of Armenia, driven from his Country by the Romans. Tiridates, His younger Brother, Pris'ner at large in Rome, and kept as Hostage till his Brother came in. Caska, Servant to Sertorius. Corbulo, and four or five more Veterans. Women. Hersilia, Daughter to Emilius. Verginia, Her Sister, the Vestal. Marcellina, Their Cousin. Scene ROME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Prologues, like Forlorn-hopes, first face the Stage, Before the main Battalions do engage: Just so our Poet, doubtful of the day, Ventures his Prologue first, and next his Play. But stay, I fancy that I hear one call; I'le step but to the door, and tell you all. Troth 'tis the Poets voice, now danger's near; He sends me back as his Commissioner, To treat that he might fairly march away, If you wou'd be content to have no Play. He offers fair: Shou'd it prove very bad, As like enough it will, you'd wish you had: He has been wounded, proofs there need no more Than what you know, that he has writ before; For sure none ever scap'd that ever writ; There's no being shot-free in the Wars of Wit: Poets by dangers like old Souldiers taught, Grow wise, and shun the fame which once they sought. But if he must proceedâ Wou'd you wou'd tell him which of all the ways You like in Prologues, us'd to help out Plays. Some tell you stories of the former Age, And swear that Faction now undoes the Stage: Sure such believe you'l do as you are bid, And that you paid your money to be chid. Some craftier Poets at each other hit, Knowing grave Rudeness has been took for Wit; This does a wretched dearth of Wit betray, When things of Kind on one another prey. Some Prologues are more modestly address'd, Just like Petitions, those he thinks are best; For such a one he means that this shall be, And therefore humbly shews as you shall see.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. SCEN. I. Enter Sertorius and Sulpitius. Sert. Not speak to her, nor see her! Sulp. But for a few days. Sert. A minute is too much. Sulp. Be but patient. Sert. And tamely wait upon my Rival's triumph. Sul. You do mistake. Sert. So do you, to think a Roman Soul can be So mean to stoop to his own Victory; Submitting to a Princes empty Name, And tamely yield unto a vanquish'd Fame. Sulp. Your Passion tells you wrong; 'tis not that Prince, But 'tis Hersilia sends you these Commands. Sert. I care not whence they came, I like 'um not. Sulp. You throw away your fury now as wildly, As Tempests waste their giddy violence. Sert. No matter, raging Storms grow loud and high When they are most oppos'd, and so will I. Sulp. Am not I your Brother! Sert. Is not Prince Tiridates, as you call him, Your bosom Friend? Sulp. You are not jealous, are you, that his Frienship Makes me betray the trust you plac'd in me? Sert. You shou'd have scrupled then to bring a Brother Such an unwelcom Message. Sulp. Consult a little with your prudence. Sert. Wisdom's too froward to let any find Trust in himself, or pleasure in his mind; She takes by what she gives, her help destroys; She shakes our Courage, and disturbs our joys: Rashness allows unto the sudden sense All its own joys, and adds her Confidence. Sulp. You have not patience but to hear the Circumstance. Sert. Well, well, what is't? quickly then. Sulp. 'Tis more than you deserve. Sert. Then keep it for your self. Sulp. They properly belong to you, Since they were her commands; when she sent them She mingled trouble with her seeming cruelty, âThen sigh'd, and paus'dâthen bid me tell you, Her Father was so kind to Tiridates, She cou'd no other way deny his Visits, But by forbidding yours for some few days, To give her self time to attempt some Friends, To try their interest to perswade her Father That she with freedom may be left to chuse Where inclination guids her. Sert. Um'h. Sulp. Now Sir, is the Circumstance so trivial? Sert. But was this all she said? Sulp. Was not this enough? Sert. As it may proveâ You are sure Tiridates will be forbid too,â âAre you not?â Sulp. As I suppose. Sert. I will be sure of that,âor elseâ Sulp. What need you question it? in a few hours You will discover that you are abus'd, If there be foul play meant on any side. Sert. That's true,âbutâ Sulp. Come, trouble your self no more, but strictly Observe what she commands. These starts are the Convulsions of weak Reason, When fits of Passion grow too strong upon you. We have all our haggard Passions, but none so wild Or so unman'd as yours;â They may be tam'd and brought from their excess, And watch'd by Reason into gentleness. Sert. Without your Simile I will endeavour to endure it, âButâ Sulp. But what? Sert. I find a mutiny in all my Faculties, That will not yield to this Cessation; My Tongue seems to consent without Commission: But I'le go wrangle with my self, And will obey herâif I canâ [Exit Sertorius. Sulp. Where must my wild beginnings find an end? Nature and Friendship; Brother too, and Friend! Titles that grow in soils so rich and good, Whose Roots are spread in Honour and in Blood: Yet all those ties keep not their hold so fast, As to oppose unshaken but one blast Of Loves unruly storm; great Trees fall so, Pulling up all about 'um where they grow. Enter Tiridates, runs to Sulpitius, and embraces him. Tir. O my Sulpitius, thou that canst prove Friend to the Rival of thy Brother's Love; Have you yet spoke of me, and wou'd she hear? 'Tis not thy Friendship but her Love I fear. Sulp. I did not name you. Tir. âPerhaps you did not dare. Methinks concern'd Physitians, in despair, Gaze on their Patients as you stare on me, And from their Skill sink to their Piety. Sulp. I wish Hersilia had not nam'd you. Tir. You are my Friend. Sulp. And therefore cou'd not like th'unwelcom office That she has put upon me. Tir. Cou'd you dislike what she commands! Sulp. Yes, I do, or else I must repent My Love to you, and grow indifferent. Know, 'tis the cruel fair Hersilia's pleasure You shou'd forbear to visit her, or if you meet her, To speak to her for some few days. [He looks down as sad. Tir. Why shou'd Hersilia cruelly contrive Death for that passion which she keeps alive? But 'tis a guilt to question or repine; She acts like what she seems, somthing divine: For when Mankind their frailer passions show, Those Pow'rs above condemn that made them so. Sulp. I fear'd 'twou'd trouble you, for I can find A measure of your sorrows by my mind. Tir. Did she not tell you why? Sulp. âThat she refus'd, Though I still prest it to finde out her end, More then became one that was less your friend: At last continuing still importunate, She told me with a smile, 'twas not her hate, Nor love unto another was the cause, She seem'd to be so cruel in these Laws. Tir. When I lost my Brotherâ Brave Artabaces whom I cou'd not call More brother then a friend; for he was all; I did not think a friendship cou'd express It self so great, to make his loss the less: But thine, my dear Sulpitius, is above The Rules and Measures of the strictest love. You might have hop't to see your Brothers joy, Sprung from those harsh commands which mine destroy. Sulp. My love unto Sertorius is not less, I wish his gratitude his happiness, To pay great Marcellina all Love's scores, Whom every Roman but himself adores: Why do ye droop? fie, fie, do not give way To your encroaching griefs; hope and obey: In the mean time during your banishment, In my best love and care rest confident. I'le weary her with pray'rs, till I obtain Leave from her lips to call you back again. Ter. My hopes are only rais'd by thy kinde charms, O let me alwayes hold thee in my armes. [Embrace. Enter Sertorius. Ser. I must go back and tell him 'tis impossible. âHaâtwisted.â Sulp. How, my Brother!â I must say something quickly; butâwhat, âBrotherâperhaps you wonderâ Ser. Yes, I do. Sulp. I mean, to see my kindeness at this time So great to Tiridates: but as a friend, I cou'd not be exempt from pitty. Sert. What pitty does he need? Sulp. It seems much more then you, In the severe commands of fair Hersilia: He is for ever banished; no time nor hopes Allow'd to him: you are too generous To swell upon his sinking. Sert. That I despise. Sulp. Pray give me leave at least to shew That pitty which a friend ought to bestow: Perhaps the reasons of a friend may prove A balm to cure the wounds of hopeless Love. [Goes to Tiridates. âI cou'd not stay a minute Sirâ From telling you the happy news Which you may finde writ in my Brothers looks. The fair and just Hersilia has pronounc'd His banishment for ever.â Enter Hersilia and Marcellina. Ha, Hersilia! what new confusions crowd upon me? How near my my plots are to discovery! I must out-face fortune and honesty. [He steps to Sertorius hastily. Brother, give not Tiridates the advantage To seem more pleas'd then you in his obedience. I'le instantly attempt to serve you. [Goes to Hersilia. âMadam, this unexpected happiness Addes to the greatness of it. Hers. The coolness of the evening, and these Walks, Invited out me and my Cousin, Not thinking to have met so much good company As you, Prince Tiridates, and Sertorius. [She curt'sies to them, and they bow and stand still. âHaâMarcellina, a word. [Speaks aside with Marcellina. D'you not observe what an nnusual distance Prince Tiridates, and Sertorius keep? Marc. I both observe and wonder. Hers. Peace, let's be goneâ We have almost tir'd our selves Sir, And were just now returning home. Sulp. Permit me Madam to receive the honor Of waiting on you; I have something to acquaint you with. Enter Servant. Ser. Madam, Your Sister the fair Verginia is just now Brought from the Vestals, and begs to see you. Hers. I long as much to look on her: They say she is much alter'd.â âThis is strange Marcellina.â [Looks at Tiridates and Sertorius. Sulp. I will return presently; till then be silent; [To Sertorius. I wait upon you Madam. [Exeunt. Manet Tiridates and Sertorius; they stare at one another; at last Sertorius speaks. Sert. I hope you do not think that I forbore To speak my love and thoughts unto Hersilia, Because a Rival did look on. Tir. Nor did that hinder me to own my love. Sert. Your hopes upon her Fathers friendship move. Tir. The greatness of my love is its own aid. Sert. Some use of empty titles might be made: There is a noise with names of Princes brought; Yet though her Father is with nothing caught, Those that have conquer'd Princes need not show Respect to titles which they can bestow. Tir. Cou'd any Roman Sword finde victory, As soon as you can with your vanity, A Prince indeed might tremble then to hear, But now he smiles at what you'd have him fear. Sert. O you shall see that I can keep my word, And shew no Roman e're out-talk'd his Sword; [They draw and fight. To this a greater quarrel yet I joyn, Hersilia's cause, they equally are mine. Enter Sulpitius, runs in and parts them. Sulp. Hold, hold, hear me but speak: From what hid cause does all this fury break? Sert. Love is our cause which we resolve to trust To our own Swords, we're sure that they are just. Tir. 'Tis mean to wait for one to be deny'd, And to refer that which we may decide: Death is the certain Umpire that makes friends; With him that dyes Hersilia's trouble ends. Sert. Stand by, and since you wear the double tyes Of Friend and Brother, look with equal eyes. Sulp. Must Hersilia thus Be sav'd from trouble by the loss of Fame? Your Swords will wound her yet unspotted name; No drop of blood you shed but will remain Upon her injur'd innocence, a stain; She will be equally oblig'd to hate The Victors life; the vanquish'd in his fate. Sert. She's cruel now; if she her hate shou'd show When I am dead, 'tis more then I shall know. Sulp. Suppose she never wou'd your loves requite, For what is't then you wou'd pretend to fight? 'Tis vain to strive for Empire that wou'd be Not gain'd, but rather lost by victory. Sert. Yet without conquest she is gain'd by none, And only can be overcome by one; Both in Hersilia cannot happy prove, The Government is Monarchy in love. Tir. Sulpitius now your troubles shall have end, Left free to serve a brother or a friend: He that first falls, (for one of us must dye) Leaves you to to'ther as his legacy. Sert. All the disputes of love are judg'd by fate, And death makes room when life is grown to strait. [Offer to fight. Sulp. Hold, hear me a word! Sert. Pish. Sulp. Of you I ask it, Tiridates, stay, And let your reason this rash action weigh. Tir. Love never waits on Reason but on chance; But why shou'd you advise this temperance? Bid me be cold, and bring the Fever too; Hersilia sent the banishment by you. Sert. Ha,â Did my careful brother bring you such news? Tir. Yes, and from Hersilia's cruel lips. Sert. I received just such another message. Can you tell Brother which was the Copy and Original? Sulp. No. Tir. How! Sert. Whence came they then? Sulp. From me. Sert. And your invention. Sulp. Right. D'you think Hersilia's lov'd by you alone? Had I perceiv'd it easie to be done, I wou'd have fool'd you both: Why d'you stare? D'you wonder that I love, or that I dare Avow a passion which both you proclaim? I'le be as loud as you in Love or Fame. Sert. O Monster. Sulp. See I am chang'd, of your opinion grown, [Draws. Think life and love is useful but for one: We shall but hinder one another still; agree Which is my man, so Fate and Love for me. Sert. Brave Tiridates, This villains baseness the first cause removes, And makes the quarrel Natures, which was loves: To me 'tis just the title to resign, To let out his foul blood that will stain mine: Nor will I on the score of Rivals fight. And while I take my own injure your right: But as his executioner I'le prove, The Minister of Justice, not of Love. Sulp. Fight you by your own rules, I'le make the Laws For my own Sword, and love shall be my Cause. [Offers to fight. Tir. Hold, hold Sertorius, No seeming cause can check or couzen Fame, Every thing will at last bear its own name; You may stand by with justice and look on, Nature is your excuse, but I have none. Sert. Nature did never yet send an excuse In her own whispers, for her own abuse. Sulp. Come come, we trifle; let some lots decide Which of your Fates with mine shall first be try'd. Sert. Fortune has ever been too curst to me, To trust her with my hopes of victory: But Tiridates now methinks we shew In our own cause too quick, in Loves too slow: He that survives of us by love will be Entitled to revenge thy Treachery. Tir. Thus I embrace the offer. [Offer to fight. Sulp. Not so fast, I will fight too, and will not fight the last: That mighty rate which nicely you assign Your love and honour, I have fixt on mine. Sert. My flesh trembles like shaking earth, when prest By tempests that want room within her breast: Through all my veins there runs a boiling flood, And makes a thousand pulses in my blood. Tir. Stay, Sertorius, stay; methinks we grow Too bold; Hersilia's sentence show'd bestow Life, or give death: we but like rebels are, While with our Swords Hersilia's pow'r we share. Come let us go like friends in misery, And from our Judges lips learn which shall dye. Sert. He does dissemble sureâ'tis nobleâ [Aside. Brave Prince, with your fair temper I am brought To reason, by a Rivals friendship taught: Had you or I sunk under t'others hate, The living wou'd have pittied his hard fate. Though love condemns, our grief may be the same; For death's all one brought by a Sword or Flame: 'Twere mean, if love had not the pow'r to shew That gen'rous grief which honour can bestow. [They put up. Why shou'd the steps rais'd by our honour prove Too hard to be ascended by our love. Sulp. Good, very good; d'ye think to couzen me? You practise to dissemble scurvily. Tir. All treachery dwells only in thy breast. Sulp. Pish, none are truly by themselves exprest; He that seems vertuous does but act a part, And shews not his own Nature, but his Art. Sert. I can be tame no longer. [Draws and offers to run at him. Tir. âSertorius stay Our friendship must not yet oblige this way. Sulp. O does the mask fall off! Sert. Let us together then dispatch the Traytor. Sulp. You dare notâ âYour honours as my guard will stand; You both scorn odds, and I a single hand. Sert. Tortures seize thee.âTiridatesâ [Makes a sign to him. Tir. Enough. Sulp. I'le follow too: O you need say no more. Ser. How meanly we must part! never before Honour and Love shew'd such strange properties, To keep all safe by being enemies; With their own niceness they themselves betray, And while they both command they both obey. [Exeunt at several doors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCEN. I. Enter Emilius, Hersilia, Marcellina, and Verginia vail'd. Emil. Welcome my sweet, my dear Verginia; Off with this cloud, in thy own brightness shine, And let my longing eyes twist rayes with thine; All my decaying joyes grow warm, and bring A heat which thaws me into youth agin. Ver. Are you my Father Sir? Emil. I am, sweet Innocence; and richer in that title By Natures gift, then he that by his fame Of his own Countrey gains a Fathers name. Ver. Your pardon Sir, that I seem amaz'd, I never saw a man before. Her. Pray Sir give us leave To have a little share in her enjoyment; Dearest Sister, you look amaz'd or troubled. [Embraces her. Ver. Pardon me dear Sister, if you finde Some small disturbance hang about my minde; To be thus soon from a devotion brought, Not more by precept then by custom taught. Mar. Dear Cousin, so much kindness yet express As to take pleasure in our happiness. Ver. 'Twere want of true Religion not to know Some joy in so much goodness which you shew. Emil. My dear Verginia, I have found out a man to make thee happy, Whose vertues, and whose fortunes shall contend Which are the greatest, both without an end. Ver. What does my Father mean? Emil. Come Verginia, company troubles thee I see, Be not amaz'd; I must be fond of thee, To wean thee from thy self, till thou sha't finde No room but for content within thy minde. [Exeunt. [Manet Hersilia, and Marcellina. Mar. How fair she is, how full of innocence! All true content dwells with upractic'd sense. Her. O Marcellina! Though knowledge does beget both joy and love, Yet vice and sorrow too her issue prove; Prest with the last the greatest numbers shew; And the worlds seeming mischief is to know. âDid you not wonder Marcellina At the strange distance that was kept so strictly By Tiridates and Sertorius. Mar. I did and was as much amaz'd as you; I wish no mischief happen, for their looks Strove with a strange constraint. Hers. Prince Tiridates too exprest the same âWhose gentle temper I have alwayes seen, Like standing water wearing still one face, That had no tides to move it from its place. Mar. Can you guess the cause? Her. Not in the least. Mar. I need not ask, it is enough that they are Rivals, And both love you. Hers. Such quarrels still my injury must prove; Both may deserve, but cannot have my love; Love cannot like the winde its help convey To fill two sails, though both are spread one way. Mar. D'you love one of them? Her. Yes, but not Sertorius: Though freely I confess my love to thee; Yet I forgive thy short return to me, Which seems to violate our friendships laws; But his ingratitude pleads in thy cause; Since the acknowledgement wou'd lay a blame On thy great soul, or on thy cheeks a shame. Mar. Be not deceiv'd Hersilia, I wou'd not make my self so guilty prove, And like a hidden sin disown my love. Hers. Thus his ingratitude the more is shown. Mar. By his ingratitude confess your own: Where does the difference appear to be? You cannot sigh for him, nor he for me. Hers. But you deserve much more then he can do. Mar. He merits more then me, he merits you: Love pleads no cause for the unfortunate, Choice rules above our pow'r as much as fate: Love unrewarded may to vertue grow, But love for love like a design may shew. Hers. Sertorius, my revenge not love invites, And that strict friendship which our souls unites: Must now our souls affections separate, And what you love 'tis just that I shou'd hate. Mar. What friendship wou'd return my love denyes, I dare not say I hate whom you despise. Enter Sulpitius. Hers. Peace; Sulpitius; Let him not see disorder in our looks, I suspect him.âHow amaz'd he seems! Sulp. Help fortune now, thou that hast alwayes sent Thy willing aid to the most confident. âMadamâ Her. Sir. Sulp. Perhaps your own amazement might be less, Cou'd I forbear my wonder to express. Her. What wonder Sir? Sulp. Some wonder must attend a suddain change, To see Prince Tiridates and Sertorius strange. So unlike Lovers now they did appear, That they both seem'd as if they never were. Hers. I know not what you mean. Sulp. I wish 'twere so, my troubles then might end, One is my brother, t'other is my friend: Yet to those titles there is nothing due, Since they so soon forgot themselves and you. Her. You only fancy sure this strange neglect, They paid to me as much as I expect. Sul. I'm sorry that my passion renders me The severe judge of their inconstancy. Hers. Your passion Sir! Sulp. Yes mine, so mingled with eternity, It understood not what they seem'd to be. Mar. You speak too like a Rival now to prove An uncorrupted judge in plea's of love. Sul. If I confess the bonds in which I'm ti'd, Fair Marcellina shou'd not seem to chide; Since if the just Hersilia pitties me, I leave Sertorius to her love more free. Mar. In such mean paths as couz'ning States-men move, To walk to greatness, others tread to love: Both creep upon the strength of fawning lyes, And on mens blasted fames attempt to rise. Sulp. This to me Madam that have alwayes shewn, A sorrow for your wrong! Mar. I know of none, But those which I receive from your design; The injury of vertue must be mine. Sulp. Vertue by truth receives no injury. Her. Truth is ill carried by an enemy; I'le do my self and them at least this right, To forbid you to come into my sight. O Marcellina, [As going out. How hard it is my trouble to disguize, Though I believe not him, I must my eyes. [Exeunt. Manet Sulpitius. Sulp. What can this mean perhaps they both agree! To hide their trouble, and to couzen me; 'Twas dull and foolish to betray my flame, Designs that hit shou'd be as swift as aim. They shou'd go quicker off; Powder not dry Does seldom hit, but makes the foul more shie. Enter Servant. O Claudius welcome. Ser. Have you sped Sir? Sulp. Indifferently; but still thy merits Deserve more then I promis'd: Here, take this, And still continue constant to my wishes; I shall need thy further help. Ser. You shall not fail to have it Sir. Sulp. Meet me an hour hence Hard by the Flavian Bridge: fail not. Ser. You need not Sir repeat commands to me. Sulp. Thy rewards shall fall like show'rs upon thee. [Ex. Serv. My plots fall short, like darts which rash hands throw With an ill aim, and have too far to go; Nor can I long discoveries prevent, I deal too much among the innocent: Their tracks are not so soon discern'd that go Thorow foul paths, as theirs that tread in snow. [Exit, Enter Sertorius and Caska. Sert. When will Tiridates meet? Cask. Presently, Sir; he promis'd to be there as soon as you. A little farther brings you to the place. Sert. He's noble. Why shou'd it easier prove To agree more in Virtue than in Love! Those that are Rivals in their Piety Are kind, yet all bow to one Deity: We both have but one Altar and one Flame, Our Honour, Love and Wishes are the same; From those fair Springs true Friendship us'd to flow; But from those Fountains now our Quarrels grow. Enter Mutius. Mut. Noble Sertorius. Sert. You mean Sulpitius. Mut. I shou'd be glad to see him. Sert. Prethee look him. [Exit with Caska. Mut. What's this! I have been better entertain'd: My Sword has help'd this Man to Victory; But now it seems there is no use of me: There may come yet a timeâ Enter five or six Veterans. 1. Brave Mutius. Mut. Mighty Plebeians, yours. 1. A hard time, Mutius. Mut. Easie enough for you, brave Veterans; I take it you are not cloy'd with business. 2. 'Troth we have scarce business for our teeth. Mut. Draw 'um then; Hunger is the worst kind of tooth-ach. 1. We have been courted Mutius, Speeches made to us, and call'd the Bulwarks of the Country; Now we are slighted. Mut. Did you intend that for a jest? I hate a Souldier that is poor and witty; Wit is the peace of every man; hang it, A Souldier should be blunt and mutinous. 1. We shou'd be hang'd then. Mut. Not if you'd hang together, puppies. O the brave days of Julius, when he flew The Roman Eagles at the stooping World, And dar'd it like a Lark! 1. I, I, those were days. Mut. Peace is the rust of Minds; brave Souls refine By great Examples, and with use they shine. I remember Pharsalia's dreadful Field, When the first Ranks came to so neer a view, The Roman Souldiers all each other knew; In vain the Generals gave their fierce Commands, The eyes of both the Armies held their hands; While Brothers gaze, and Fathers Sons behold, Nature in whispers her fond stories told; Friends gaz'd on Friends, forgot they were to fight, And made a halt as shameful as a flight; When Crastinus advanc'd before the rest, And struck his Pyle into a Roman breast: As from one Cloud vast Tempests fill the Skies, So showr's of Piles from his began to rise: Had not his great example set us free, We had been rob'd of that days Victory. 1. I Captain, our Emperor has shut up Janus Gates, The World's at peace now. Mut. Let him lull in't, Till he forget the way how to Command; 'Tis a dark Lanthorn in a Princes hand; 'Tis Peace that shines, while he in darkness lives, Hid by the light which he to others gives. The Gown-men now by cherish'd Vices thrive; Virtue is starv'd, or hardly kept alive; Mischief is fed, while out of Policy They keep some to betray, and some to lie. 1. No employment now for Souldiers. Mut. You are dull Blockheads when y'are out of pay; The Souldiers Vices lie another way. D'ye think that Statesmens kindnesses proceed From any principles but their own need? When they'r affraid, they'r wondrous good and free; But when they'r safe they have no memory. 1. The Great men swallow all. Mut. Mankind upon each others ruines rise Cowards maintain the brave, and Fools the Wise: Honour and all Religion bears a price, But as the rates are set by death and vice. Enter Sulpitius. Sulp. Brave Mutius, never more happily met. Mut. That's well; did you not meet Sertorius? Sulp. No, why d'ye ask? Mut. Nay nothing; I thought he had been going to keep an Oracle, He practis'd to stare and swell strangely. Sulp. Let him swell and burst, it matters not. âWho are these, Mutius? Mut. Quiet Rogues; they were brave Souldiers. Sulp. Have they lost their Spirits? Mut. I know not; they are out of practise; They have been bob'd; They might be train'd agin perhaps, and enter'd. Sulp. This way a little, Mutius; you are my Friend. Mut. I wou'd cut any man's throat That said the contrary. Sulp. I must use your Sword, Mutius. Mut. Heer it hangs ready, 'tis almost rusty. Sulp. Be not startled when I tell you 'Tis against my Brother. Mut. Let it be against your Father, 'Tis all one to me. Sul. The quarrel is Hersilia. Mut. A Woman is the worst that cou'd be. Are you to fight who shall have her? Sulp. That she must only judg. Mut. So then, shall we fight to make her sport? A parcel of such Lovers Wou'd make excellent pastime in the Amphitheatre: I had an easier way with my Damsels; Kind or cruel, they never scap'd me. Sulp. Not if you cou'd come at 'um, Mutius. Mut. If they were hid in Houses I made 'um bolt with Fire, And pitch'd my toils on all sides ready for 'um. Sul. Haâ 1. Noble Mutius, farewel; we'l wait on you Another time. Sulp. Pray let your Friends stay a little. Mut. Stay Gentlemen. Sulp. Fire a House, Mutius! Mut. There's no such way; the coyest then Will leap into the next mans arms: I have been thank'd for saving them Out of the very Fire that I kindled. Sulp. They may live to love Hersilia. [Seems troubled. Mut. If we kill 'um, 'tis two to one however That you'l ne're have her. Sulp. Dare these men stick by us? Mut. Pay 'um well, and let the business Be wicked enough; Then never fear 'um. Sul. They shall eat gold. Mut. 'Troth I believe they can digest it too. Sulp. Thou hast put wild thoughts into my head: If I shou'd fall, she crowns their Victory; Or if Prince Tiridates falls by me, I must live hated by her. You Pow'rs above, Let either Death or Life reward my Love. Mut. You are troubled, Sir: I did not talk To save the fighting part: I wou'd serve you in your love Through greater dangers. Sulp. O Mutius, advise me somthing; My blood and thoughts stand still within my breast; Reason's asleep, and torments seem at rest. Mut. Why I have told you my best stratagem; If you get her Father's house but fir'd, Let us alone, we'l help to quench it; And in the hurry we may get your Mistress; There's no suspicion waits on such disorders. Sulp. Dear Mutius, thou reviv'st my drooping Soul; There is no other way left probable. Enter Claudius a Servant. See Mutius, Fortune seconds thy advice, Here's one may prove the instrumentâwalk off. Claudius, welcome; here I have been short in my Rewards. [Gives him money. Cl. You have been, Sir, too bountiful To my small services. Sulp. I have a business, if thou dar'st attempt it, Shall treble thy Rewards, and yet leave me thy debtor. Claud. Name it Sir, and think it done. Sulp. Thou know'st How unsuccesful I am like to prove; One Act of thine may help me to Hersilia, Then think what thy reward shall be. Cl. Speak but the thing, Sir. Sulp. Presently then in some convenient place Set fire on thy Master's house; do not wonder, I'le have those ready that shall quench it quickly; And in the hurry, under pretence of help, Bring Hersilia forth at the East-gate, That looks towards the Tiber; There I'le wait for her; and by my happiness Measure thy own Rewards. Claud. Whither shall we fly, Sir? Sulp. Trouble not thy self, leave that to me: Dar'st thou do it? Claud. When wou'd you have it done, Sir? Sulp. Presently, before suspicion can have time to grow. Claud. I'le do it Sir; be sure that you wait ready. Sulp. Be gone about it, let me see it flame Before an hour's expir'd: trust to me, And have no fears. Claud. I know an unfrequented room Fit for my purpose; I'le do it instantly: Expect me at the East-gate. [Ex. Claud. Sulp. I will not fail. 'Tis done Mutius, 'tis a fire already; That fellow is a servant to Emilius, Whom I have made my Slave with Bribes; He's gone about it: Are your friends prepar'd? Mut. Beyond sick men, ready to dye for you. Sulp. 'Tis well, I'le place you in your several stations That she may scape no way: Then if we can but carry off our plunder. Mut. Pish, the fire will have all the enemies, We shall have none. Sulp. Where shall our rendezvouz be? Mut. At my house of pleasure That stands upon the Tiber; That will be least suspected, because I live Most in the City: besides, we have the River To help us to escape if need require. Sulp. No better place.âGentlemen, Pray observe such orders as my friend Mutius gives you. He shall have money to reward you Equal to all your services, and beyond modest wishes. 1., 2. Doubt us not, Sir, we will be punctual. Sulp. Come Mutius, as we go We will agree on the particulars: Justice has took away all my compassion; And when their flames in cruel brightness shine, I'le smile, since there was none that pittied mine. [Exeunt. Enter Sertorius and Caska. Sert. Have you plac'd the Horses where I appointed? Cask. Yes Sir. Ser. I have but one thing more then to enjoyn thee; If I shou'd fall by Tiridates Sword, Carry the news thy self unto Hersilia, And watch her as thou woud'st an Arrow shot To see whether it hit or no. Cask. To what purpose Sir? Sert. If she had any pitty for me living, Her sorrow for me dead, will shew it. Caska. But how Sir shou'd I send you word? Sert. 'Tis true, abundance travel through the Grave; But there's not one of all the multitude Will carry more then his own news about him: Why shou'd things so remote beget such strife Beyond our knowledge, and beyond our life? Succession thus some to fond joyes betray, For whose vain hopes their ruine must make way. Enter Tiridates. Cask. Prince Tiridates Sir. Sert. O 'tis well; leave us now Caska, And watch where I appointed: If Tiridates comes without me, Let him receive those helps that I shou'd have. Cask. This is a cruel service Sir. Sert. Dispute it not. [Exit. Caska. Tir. Your pardon Sertorius that I seem'd thus slow. I was enforced to make some little stay To scape Sulpitius; he and Mutius Were earnest in discourse. Sert. May be they are looking us; Mutius is bold, Nor is that base Sulpitius less then he; And thus much Tiridates I'le acknowledge, Had they now met us with their Swords about 'um: I shou'd with much more pleasure as your friend Have took my share against 'um. [Draws. Tir. Assisted by Sertorius, I shou'd have been As sure of conquest as he is now of Victory. [Draws. I have one motion only left to make, He that survives let him go tell Hersilia That though his Rival in the fatal strife Was lost in death, yet love out-liv'd his life. Sert. I will be just to you; but if I fall, Carry no news of love; nor me at all; For I have thought upon't, and finde it vain, To me no message can come back again. âSo, to our fortunes. [Fight. Enter Caska hastily. Cask. Hold, hold, as you have honor hold. Sert. Ha, Caska, what tempts thee to this folly? Cask. The sadest spectacle that ever was: Emilius house seems almost wrapt in flame; The noise of people, and the fire encrease. Sert. Take heed you do not play the fool. Cask. Go but to the place where you appointed me to wait, And if it be not true, cut me to pieces: While you doubt, You but delay to help Hersilia. Tir. Can this be true! Cask. Or I am more a villain then I was us'd to be. Sert. We may believe him. Come Tiridates, Hersilia's danger now our quarrel ends, And when she is unsafe we must be friends: Our actions some fantastick planet guides, Ill fortune can unite whom good divides. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. SCEN. I. The Scene appears a burning house. Enter Artabaces. Artab. What noise is this!âHow! [noise. A house in flames! where e're I go I see Ruines of several natures wait on me. âHark, they cry for helpâ [noise of help. 'Twere pitty to devote my self to flames To save I know not who; what need I care? He that is wretched has a life to spare; Fate shall not need look after me, I'le try Which is most careless grown, Fortune or I, [Exit as into the house. Enter Mutius, and two Souldiers. Mut. No stirring yet? 1 Sould. Not as we can see. Mut. They are not sing'd yet: Nor do I gaze with such a gust of joy, As Pyrrhus had to look on burning Troy: That this might grow to be Romes funeral flame, And in its ashes bury its own name. 2 Sould. Shall we go to th'other side? Mut. We'l keep our motions in this compass. 1 S. How shou'd we know the right Lady, Mutius? Mut. Troth 'twas high time to ask; Yet to say truth, I scarcely know my self; But that we may be sure not to mistake, Catch up every thing that looks but like a woman. Come softly this way. [Exeunt. Enter Artabaces with Verginia vail'd, and in a swoon. Art. Here's something yet, she was well sing'd, And had been over-roasted presently. [Sets her down. âNow, let me see my purchase.â âHa,âmy eyes dazel as if they star'd on Sun-shine. âI'le wipe 'um, and then look agin; Her eyes are clos'd; and though with her 'tis night, Her beauty shines without the help of light: A darker form has hid a deity, But death's too near for immortality. I'le bow her gently; Nature begins to triumph in the strife, And through her lips soft whispers steal of life. How fresh they shew, the Roses almost gone For want of aire, by breath seem newly blown. Ver. âHa.âwhere am I? Hersilia, Sister, Hersilia,â Haâwho are you? are you not my Father? Art. No, by no means fair creature. Ver. Are you not a man? Art. That's an odde questionâyes.â Ver. You shou'd be then my Father. Art. That's right, a man indeed shou'd be her Father. [aside. Ver. Or is there any other man besides my Father? Art. She's mad, overheated with the fire. Ver. Pray pardon my want of knowledge, I never saw a man besides my Father, Till I saw you, if you be one. Art. This is the likeliest thing to be a Virgin That I e're met with. [aside. âWhere have you liv'd, to be so ignorant? Ver. Among the Vestal Virgins from an Infant, And helpt to keep the Sacred Fire alive. Art. O that my flame, as pure as those, might be Fed by your pitty, though not piety! Ver. Help me but back again, and I'le attend With true devotion those pure flames you send. Art. From ignorance alas her pitty grows, Her innocence above a vertue shews. Ver. I had forgot, my Father and my Sister May want the help that you ill plac'd in me. O pitty, there's rather my misery; Their merits and rewards far exceed mine. Art. Rewards cou'd never yet my soul encline. Ver. I can invite you then no other way. Art. Command me to my death, and I obey. Ver. Sure all mankinde are not thus vertuous too. Art. All woman-kinde do less resemble you. Ver. Hark, a noise agin; O my Father! [noise. Gentle Sir, that gen'rous pitty shew, Which those above gave you but to bestow. [weeps. Art. Dry up your tears, fair innocence; I only beg if I return That I may finde you in this place agin. Ver. Here you shall finde me sending up my pray'rs For your success and happiness. Art. I had forgot to ask your name. bows, and as going. Ver. Verginia, Sir; my fathers name's Emilius, You never askt me that. Art. Nor never shou'd; I have your word to stay just in this place. Ver. You need not doubt; I know not where to go. Art. 'Tis all I ask for my reward; Think bright Verginia, all your cares are mine. Fortune has play'd her tricks, now Love pay thine. [Exit, as into the burning house. Manet Verginia. Ver. Does heaven on all mankinde such good bestow? My Fortune's excellent, or they are so: I grow strangely concern'd, some unknown cause A secret warmth into my bosom draws; I blush I know not why; my confus'd sense Whispers, that shame can live with innocence; Minds like smooth paper never writ upon, When folded up, by some impression Marks will remain it never had before, And ne're return to former smoothness more. Enter Mutius, and three or four. Mut. No news yet of Sulpitius! âThe women are all burnt I hope. âHa, here's one yet left, a very fair one too. âCome Lady, you must along with me. Ver. What are you? Mut. Why, men. Ver. You wou'd not be thus rude then. Mut. Who the Devil shou'd be rude, if men shou'd not? Away with her, and stay for me Under the Grove I told you of. 1. Come along. Ver. Whither? why d'ye pull me? Alas, you'l frighten me. Mut. She's wond'rous fair.âAway with her. I hope this is not Hersilia.â [aside. Then 'tis fair play: Equal danger, equal plunder. Ver. Pray do not pull me, I promis'd to stay here Till a friend come; I must not break my word. Mut. Indeed you must.âAway with her. Ver. What d'ye mean. O my heart fails me. âOh. [swoons. Mut. Up with her, she'l wake with jogging: Stay where I told you; I'le see a little farther, And then come to you. [Exeunt. Enter Sulpitius and Hersilia, with Claudius and others. Sulp. Follow still behinde, and give me notice If any overtakes us: Is Cinna gone to Mutius? 1. Yes Sir. Her. Whither d'you carry me? I do command you let me go. Sulp. When we are a little farther, Free from the danger that concerns your Honor, I will obey you; till then believe it was your service, That made me throw my self into this danger. Her. This is strange, I mistrust something. Sulp. You might if you knew all I know; Pray ask no questions in this place, All is unsafe about us. [Exeunt. Enter Sertorius, bringing out Marcellina out of the fire. Mar. Set down your wretched load, for I am grown Your burthen, that only wou'd have been my own; Had you preserv'd Hersilia, you had prov'd Happy to save the person we both lov'd; But now you are as much unfortunate To save a wretched thing whom we both hate. [he stands amaz'd. Sert. Forgive the mixture which in me appears; Wrong not my joyes, nor yet condemn my fears. Mar. Why do you stay, look on those shining walls, And think that from those flames Hersilia calls. Sert. O what a wonder does your friendship prove! Forgives ungratitude, and urges love. âI know not what to do. Mar. âGo, go, And pay what you to Love and Honour owe. Sert. Then I must stay; for there is nothing due From Love or Honor justly but to you. Mar. All debts to me, to her I thus resign; Be gone, and think Hersilia's danger's mine. Ser. And leave you thus! Mar. âIf you stay here Your formal gratitude will look like fear. Sert. It is my shame to stay, my shame to go; Yet not my Virtue, but yours makes it so: If in these flames I meet my death, they'l prove As gentle, but more just then those of love. [Exit as into the house. Mar. âWhat shall I do, my thoughts are tyr'd I finde, With tedious journeyes up and down my minde; Sometimes they lose their way, sometimes as slow Like Beasts o're-loaded, heavily they move, Prest by the weight of sorrow and of love. Enter Artabaces. Art. So much for this; I'le have no more of these fiery trials, My hair stinks like new burn'd Tinder: See, she has kept her word. âBest Lady. Mar. Sir. Art. 'Slife, 'tis not she. Mar. You seem concern'd at some mistake. Art. A little Madam; it was my good fortune To save a Lady from these flames, That I expected here: 'twas her commands That sent me back, to see what help Her Father and her Sister might have need of. Mar. She was not tall Sir. Art. No Madam, her beauty and her stature Shew'd her very young. Mar. You are happy Sir, to be the fortunate preserver Of so much Innocence and Beauty. Art. D'you know her Madam? or to whom This wretched house did once belong? Mar. She was my Cousin Sir, and that was once Her Fathers Pallace: you seem a stranger by these questions. Art. I am Madam, and but arriv'd this minute: The first thing I almost saw, at least took notice of, Was this sad spectacle. Mar. Is all consum'd? Art. Every one now is scapt or perisht, And need no help, or else are past it: The last I met with was a noble Gentleman, Concern'd it seems above the thought of danger; For he appear'd careless of cracking beams, And uncheck'd flames: A suddain noise Without the house call'd him away. Mar. O Sertorius! which way Sir was the noise? Artab. 'Twas on the other side. Mar. That way Sertorius went, and I must follow. âPardon my disturbance Sirâyetâ âReason and Honor check my hasteâ But our unsteady actions cannot be Manag'd by rules of strict Philosophy; There is but part belongs unto our care; Fortune has right, and title to a share. [Exit. Manet Artabaces. Art. Shou'd fortune count with me unto this day, She'd finde there was a mighty debt to pay; The Roman Conquest o're my Countrey spread, My brother lost, or worse, in Triumph led; Sure such full Empires have no aim or guide, And those that reach 'um do not move but slide. Man is too weak to manage with frail sense, Such a resemblance of Omnipotence. A Storm at Sea threw me on Italy, And here I thought to finde my death or thee: Poor Tiridates,âhow cou'd fortune prove, So curst among my woes to mingle love! Which way to go I know not, nor need care; I have been us'd to wander in despair. All by uncertain wayes pursue their ends, And unto every object Reason bends. [Exit. The Scene shuts. Enter Emilius, and Tiridates, and followers. Emil. You have sav'd my life brave Tiridates; Wou'd I cou'd pay you with Hersilia, That wou'd appear more then a common gratitude. Tir. Hersilia is a happiness beyond My hopes and merits. Emil. This fire was kindled by some treachery; I fear Hersilia is the purchase Of their designs and mischiefs. Tir. Let us not now waste time with vain conjectures; Hersilia and Verginia may want help, While we are talking how they come to need it. Emil. 'Tis true, let us take several wayes, And meet down by the Tiber, hard by Numa's Grove. Tir. If I have life I'le bring it thither. [Ex. Emil. and followers. âWhat did I say! how cou'd I talk Of carrying any longer life about me! âBut humane things have such variety, Neither the wise nor brave know when to die; For neither justly can their deaths intend, Till they are sure all hopes have first their end. Enter Sertorius. Sert. âHaâTiridates! He's it seems no happier yet than I. Stay,âSir,âwhat news? Tir. None that either of us wish; Hersilia is for certain forc'd away By unknown persons. Sert. So I have heard. Tir. Emilius has took the great Flaminian way; Let us divide our selves,âand whenâ Se. Stay Tiridates; Fortune seems wise in bringing us together, She knows not what to do with both of us; In the pursuit of Honour she can be Liberal to many in one Victory: When Fame's the Mistress, more than one may prove Happy at once; but 'tis not so in Love. Tir. He that blind Fortune will have happy made, Let her guide him unto Hersilia's aid. Sert. She shall guide me no farther; you and I Will not ask her opinion which shall die; Our Swords will tell us all that she can know; Her means are quick, though she her self be slow. [draws. Tir. I draw for my defence, not my design; [draws. You urge a wrong both to your Love and mine; While your Revenge above your own does prove, And force my Honour to exceed my Love. Sert. 'Tis only Love that does this quarrel breed, And so my Love my Honour does exceed. Tir. Wou'd Love attempt to ruine its own aid? We fight for them by whom she is betray'd: Whoe're o'recomes, his guilty Conquest shews, Hersilia nothing to his valour owes. Sert. 'Tis true,â 'Tis against her that I my Sword employ, And she may want that help which I destroy. âForgive me, Sir:âYet all things that can move, As well as I, have felt Revenge and Love; Unruly heats are with our Essence spread, And by craz'd passion Nature's cemented. Tir. While she has Enemies let us be Friends, And now by several ways pursue our ends. Sert. Stay, I am yet confus'd; 'tis a hard fate To help to make my self unfortunate. Tir. We waste that time which takes too fast a flight, And 'tis more guilt to talk than 'twere to fight. Sert. How weak these wild distractions make me prove! I am taught when to fight, and how to love; Yet one thing more, if in your breast you have No mix'd designs but what are clear and brave; Let us engage, whoe're is happy made, To find Hersilia first, and bring her aid, That he shall make no use of his success, Nor the least story of his Love express, Till first by our own Swords our cause is try'd; It is too great for Fortune to decide. Tir. To keep this sacred here I freely vow; You learn'd at first, but teach me Honour now. Sert. Till then let us embrace; whoe're Love guides Unto his bliss, for t'other Fate provides. Now to our Fortunes; I'le pursue the way Which leads through Numa's Grove. Tir. âBut stay, Where shall we meet? Sert. Under those stately ranks Of Cypress Trees that shades the Tiber's Banks, Neer Mutius house; for still I apprehend That Man; he's Mifchiefs and my Brother's Friend. Tir. Agreed;âin equal hopes now both are tied. Sert. But when we meet our wishes must divide. [Exeunt. Enter Artabaces. Art. How ignorant of every thing I move! I know not where I go, nor what I love: Yet though she's gone, her Image still I find, And I pursue what she has lest behind. Ah, my dear Brother,âpoor Tiridates!â Cast on these Shores I came to look out thee, And by my bonds or death to set thee free; But into other fetters I am thrown, Not by my honour but my Love put on. Quite tir'd I seem, like a hard-hunted Beast, That does not seem to go, but sinks to rest. Spent Nature's weight hangs heavy on my eyes; Sleep can cure Fevers, why not Miseries? A Souls disease can few Physitians find; For Emp'ricks only practise on the mind: Yet sleep her Image might convey to me, And shew in dreams what I must never see Enter two of Mutius men with Verginia still in a swoon. 1. On, on, to the Tiber with her, And sacrifice her to Neptune. 2. The devil we will;âwhat, Go twice as far as we need, To try to be apprehended for Murderers! The next ditch will serve.âHa,âwhat's here! A dead man! 'Slife, a most excellent Companion for her; If he be asleep let him wake and answer for't; Gently, gently; so, lay her behind him. [They lay her behind Artabaces. So, now to Mutius, and swear she was dead. 1. I, and cold too. [Exeunt. Artabaces after a little time wakes. Art. Sure 'twas that Beauty which appear'd so bright; My eyes by waking rob me of my sight; When they were shut her Image did appear; I star'd too boldly sure, and made her fear. [Turns and sees her. Ha!âlook where she is; alas, I do mistake; For I dream still, and think I am awake: Some pitying Pow'r this Vision does bestow, And helps me to deceive my sorrow so. [She groans. What's that! my Senses sure are not my own! Can empty dreams and aiery visions groan! Her eyes begin to move and shine with life, Now sink again in deaths ungentle strife: In doubtful weather so the Sun resigns Sometimes his light to Clouds, and sometimes shines. She lives again; O cease your cruelty, And she'l by that example pity me. [She revives. Ver. O me! Have I not slept too long, and am to blame, Neglecting to attend the Sacred Flame? Art. Here is that Flame to which your Eyes did give Life first, and promis'd it should always live. Ver. Where are the Vestals then, or where am I? Some confus'd thoughts now shake my Memory; I do remember I was seiz'd upon By some rude men; I thought there had been none Pray, who are you? Art. âAlas, I have no Name, But that which is my trouble, or my shame. Ver. Sure both my eyes and ears deceive me now, Once I saw something lookt, and spoke like you; But by my fond desires he was betray'd; I ow'd him life, which with his death I paid. [weeps. Art. Those flames you sent me too has let me live, Perhaps reserv'd to dye by those you give. Ver. Pray do not wrong me, are you he indeed? I feel some unknown joyes that do exceed The usual measures of my happiness; I fear there may be guilt in the excess. Art. O do not fear that pitty e're can prove A guilt in any, shou'd it grow to love. Ver. Pitty is love, and then it need not grow. Art. In the worlds common Charity 'tis so; Such love is only in obedience shown To those above, the other is our own. Ver. We shou'd deny our own affections still. Art. These passions are all strangers to the Wil. When I first saw your eyes my heart was free. Ver. O that I cou'd restore your liberty. Art. That way there is no pitty to be shown, Restore not mine, but try to lose your own. Ver. Will that strange way a remedy procure? Can a Disease in one, another cure? Art. In loves Disease neither their cures obtain, But both grow well by one anothers pain. Ver. I know not what you mean, but I incline To think that your misfortunes wou'd be mine. Art. May I not dare to wish a little more? Ver. âTake heed, Our wishes may be faults when they exceed. Art. Do covetous men, or the ambitious finde Their vast desires by any bounds confin'd? If pow'rful nature lets no passion move Within known limits, why alas shou'd love? Enter the two men of Mutius. 1. On, on; we are dead men; Look where she is alive too: O happy chance. Ver. Help, help, these are the Villains. Art. Your business Rascals. [he steps before her. 1. That woman is our business. Art. You shall have her thus, dogs. [fight, kills one, th'other runs, and as he pursues, Enter Mutius, and others behinde him, and seize him. Art. Unhand me slaves. Ver. O help. Mut. You call for that you need not. Art. Slaves, Dogs. Mut. Ha, what's this, Tigellinus dead? Thy life for his is justly forfeited. [Offers to run at Artabaces, she steps between. Ver. O hold, I was the cause that stain'd his innocence With that man's blood, for 'twas in my defence; Besides, I'm tir'd with life and fit to dye. Art. There's none so weary of a Life as I; Yet if you Romans wou'd be thought such men, Give me a Sword, and try to take it then. Mut. 'Tis for her sake I do not punish thee. This fellow is not to be trusted free; [aside. Bring him along. Art. âSlaves, I will not go. Mut. Drag him along. Ver. âO do not use him so. Alas, what d'you mean? Mut. âWhy do I stay Thus trifling? Madam, come, here lies our way. Bring him alive or dead. [Exit. Ver. âPray hold your hands. Good Sir, obey their pow'r, or my commands. Art. Come, lead me where you please; how much above My reason and my courage is my love! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. SCEN. I. Enter Mutius, and Verginia. Mut. Still weeping Madam? these are unkinde tears, Love is ill paid with sorrow, or with fears. Ver. If Love's ill paid with Grief, it needs must be As ill exprest by signs of cruelty. Mut. Is it a cruelty to my soul exprest, Because I keep it pris'ner in my breast? Ver. Not while 'tis willing, but it wou'd be so Had it as much desire as I to go. Mut. Since life and you in me bear equal sway, Be not less willing then my life to stay. Ver. If bondage only does express you kinde, Why does the stranger such harsh usage finde? Can you pretend that the same act should be Cruel to him, and yet so kinde to me? Mut. O my vex'd soul! how true my fears do prove! Love betrayes me, and she betrayes her love. [aside. I'le try her yetâShou'd I not seem to be In all things kinde, to set this Stranger free? Ver. Alas, what shall I say!âI think you were, He offers all I wish, and all I fear. [aside. Mut. How brightly her betraying blushes move, And seem a glorious Traitor to her Love! [aside. Ver. Sure when he has his freedom he'l be gone. [aside. Shou'd I beg his that am deny'd my own? Mut. You need not now your pow'r or tears employ, The stranger does his liberty enjoy. Ver. But is he gone already? can it be? Mut. What, are you troubled at his liberty? Ver. Did he not ask to see me e're he went? Mut. He say'd not much: I know not what he meant. Ver. Perhaps you did refuse that small request? Mut. I cou'd not grant that which he ne're exprest. Ver. Why, did I owe my safety to his aid? O kindeness ill bestow'd, but worse repay'd? Mut. Thou hast betray'd thy self, the Lovers part I'le act henceforward with a Souldiers heart. Ver. Alas, what do you mean, what tempests rise? The gathering Storms lie rowling in your eyes. Mut. I blush that I have been so calm and tame; Conquests in Love and War are but the same; Both reach'd by boldest hands, and Fools alone Thank Fate or you for that which is their own. Ver. Alas, what have I done? Mut. âHow cou'd you be So foolish to think I had set him free? I quickly found he was too fortunate: You may cheat those you love, not those you hate. Ver. O be more gentle. Mut. âYes, when you are kinde. Ver. Storms hardly will teach calmness to a minde. Mut. You rais'd the storm which shall his ruine prove, And he shall owe his Fate unto your Love. Ver. Alas, 'tis your suspicion does engage Your fury thus; this object of your rage I never saw, till from the flames just now He brought me forth, and gave me life to owe. Mut. What flames were those? Ver. âThose wretched flames which burn'd My Fathers House, and all to ashes turn'd. Mut. O happy, Hersilia's Sister! How the kinde Fates still nearer Bonds provide, For me, and for Sulpstius to be ti'd. Ver. Are you not yet appeased? or can it be, That gratitude shou'd cause such jealousie? [walks musing, she after him. In gentle mindes love takes the most delight; Rough natures urge not passion, but affright. Mut. Come dry those gentle showrs, for there will be No need of tears, unless to pitty me. Ver. Will you no more appear in such a rage? Mut. You need not fear the Storms you can asswage: Teach me by your example, I shall prove The aptest Scholler, when I'm taught by love: âBut I forget Sulpitius,âWhose there? âHereâ [Enter 1. Receive this Virgin with respect and care, Safely till I return, and let her be Obey'd by you that is ador'd by me. Exit. Ver. I finde his jealousie has told him true, And found my love sooner then I cou'd do; What shall I say? which will the hardest prove, To hide my hate, or to conceal my love? How can I practise what I never knew? And appear false, that so I might be true? And yet if they shou'd take his life awayâ Will none of these as well as I betray? [looks on the men. âIs your Captain gone, my friend? 1. A little way. Ver. When will he return? 2. That's uncertain. Ver. He was very kinde to me; You know it best, with whom he left Commands that were so civil. 2. Yes, I think he did. Ver. I do believe there was no need; Your natures wou'd have urg'd you to as much As I shall beg. 2. What does she mean? Ver. I have a small request. 2. Well, what is't? Ver. Nay, do not ask me harshly; A kindeness may be lessened by the manner. 2. What the devil does she mean? Ver. How ruggedly they look.â [aside. Yet I shou'd take it well, nay, very kindely. 1. 'Slife how she tempts.â [aside. âWell, name it. Ver. 'Tis onlyâIf they shou'd deny me, [aside. I know you'l think it but a small request. 1. Well, let's hear it. Ver. I wou'd see the stranger that was taken with me, I have a little business with him. 1. We dare not do it. Ver. Your Captain said you shou'd obey me; But I wou'd owe it to your Natures, Rather then his commands. 2. 'Tis impossible to deny her. Ver. Yet I wou'd be grateful too; not to bribe, But to reward your gentle natures. 1. If we do not take the better care, She'l make us think w'are honest too. 2. We can easily convince her. Ver. Why d'you delay? pray make more haste to goodness; Here, divide this between you. [offers money. 1. Do'st think we shall be able to deny her? 2. 'Tis impossible to deny her, and her money too: Our Captain has a brave prize. Ver. Alas, I fear they will deny me: Are you not yet resolv'd?âhere, pray accept it. 1. Well, for once we'l strain a point; Come follow us, we'l bring ye to him: But 'tis two to one whether he'l speak to you or no; He's as sullen as a new taken Eagle. Ver. I'le venture that. 1. My companion will guide you to the place; Follow me slowly, for I must step before And prepare those that guard him. Ver. I thank you, may you finde full rewards In the success of all your just desires: [Exit. When shall the fears of mindes concern'd grow less I tremble now at my own wisht success: Courage in great distress can only aid, But fear of what shou'd help will be afraid. The Gods from passions might have made us free, Or gave us only those which best agree; For such as mine a wretched mingle prove, The want of courage, and excess of love: They were not jealous sure that we might be By vertue rais'd too near Divinity; For since within their pow'r dwells all our breath, The distance is preserv'd enough by death. [Exeunt. The Scene a solitary Room. Enter Artabaces out of it. Art. That I cou'd fly from every thought I have, And lie as senseless in my life as grave: I that had pow'r of thousand lives am thrown In bonds out of the Title to my own. [Lies down. Why did the godsâ Make us so fit for Vice and Misery? In goodness their immortal Chequers lye: They might have given our Souls better Estates, And set our Blessings at far cheaper rates. Enter one of those that went from Verginia, with another Comrade that had the keeping of Artabaces. 1. Come, come, here's that will conquer Both thy Fears and Honesty. 2. If Mutius shou'd return. 1. Pish, he's engag'd to look Sulpitius; Besides, he bid us to obey what she desir'd. 2. Well, let's go to him; to tell thee true, I pity him; 'tis a brave fellow. 1. I cou'd pity too; but we are paid too well To be good-natur'd;âprethee tell him That one desires to speak with him. 2. He's horrible surly.âSir,â D'hear Sir? there's one without desires to speak with you. Art. 'Tis a question whether I'le speak with him or no. 2. You must needs. Art. I am busie, Rascals. 1. 'Tis but a word, Sir. Art. I will not waste half a one, Slaves, for you. 2. Fetch her in man; he'l ne're be perswaded. [Exit 1. Art. What d'you stay for, gentle Sir? D'you suppose your Company is pleasant? 2. You'l be made tamer. [Starts up. Art. Yes, thus Rascals. 2. 'Twere a just act to take away your life, It troubles you. Art. Prethee do me but that curtesie; if not, Lend me the Sword, and see how kind I'le be. 2. He does amaze me. Enter Verginia and 1. Ver. Hold, hold; what's this? why a Sword drawn? 2. This madman wou'd provoke his death. Ver. Pray hold, you do mistake:âdoes he not Sir? 2. How he stares on her! 1. And how his fury slides away!âSirâ âThe LadyâSirâ Art. Peace, Slaves.âI was considering. [Stamps. 2. What, Sir? Art. That, Rascal. [Strikes him; the Fellow offers to draw. Ver. Pray hold; here, take more; pray hold: For my sake, Sir, be gentle. Art. I have done. Ver. Pray be gone; you do disturb him. [Exeunt. Why are your furious eyes so fix'd on me? I do confess I caus'd your misery. Propose your own revenge, and my just heart Against the life it feeds, will take your part. Art. Alas, if your just heart so kind can prove, To share in Griefs, teach it to share in Love. Ver. 'Tis you must teach my heart what it shou'd do; 'Tis aptest to learn any thing from you. Art. Love's hardly to be taught, easie to have; 'Tis strange you shou'd not know the thing you gave. Ver. Though what I gave perhaps I do not know, Sure I shou'd understand what you bestow. Art. Fortune, alas, has taken all from me; Love seldom is the guift of Misery. Ver. You said Pity was Love, and then 'twill prove Misfortunes that give Pity may give Love. Art. A common Pity does not Love express; Pity is Love when grown into excess. Ver. If that be all, Love is not taught I see; For before you cou'd speak 'twas learn'd by me. Sure Nature's Laws are above Heavens got; Love need not, though Religion must be taught. Art. O speak again; the breath that tells your Love Approaches like the gentle Winds that move Over the tops of fragrant flow'rs, and brings To the blest Sense their Souls upon their wings. Vir. Alas, I have said somthing which I fear Had such a sound a Virgin shou'd not hear; My Spark's too quickly shot into a Flame; To own my Love I seem to quit my Shame; And yet it is not lost, but chang'd in me; For Shame refin'd grows into Modesty. Art. O do not teach your Love a common way; Loves power is small, unless it can betray. Ver. You'l then confess y'ave pow'r enough in me, If for your sake I'me pleas'd with Treachery. But tales of Love make us forget our woes; A sudden fear upon my spirit grows, Like people that tell tales of Ghosts at night, So long till they are talk'd into a fright. Art. Such phancies, from no real cause, will prove But dreams, that hinder the repose of Love. Ver. You call my phancies dreams; but if they are, All those must wake that do their dreams declare. Think I am sleeping when you see me sad, And when I wake I'le tell what dreams I had. Enter Mutius suddenly. Mut. I cannot find Sulpitius; all's in an uproar. âHa!â What sight is this, at which my stiffened hair Starts from their shaken roots! I shou'd not stare So frightened, had I met every Ghost Started from Hell which Roman Conquests boast. Ver. Ah me! what storm is falling on us now? Art. No Thunder dwells upon a humane brow. Mut. Yes, you shall feel the Thunder that you slight: It shews more pow'r to ruine than to fright. Art. Vain slighted Villain. Ver. âPray let me speak; Perhaps he'l least resist what is most weak: Pray be not angry; did you not engage That I shou'd never see you in a rage? Mut. You Pow'rs, what an ungrateful confidence This Woman hides with painted Innocence! Art. Wou'dst thou have thanks for want of liberty? Which way is gratitude grown due to thee? Mut. While thou dost speak 'tis with ingrateful breath, Which I cou'd stifle if I wou'd in death. Art. Prethee then do.â Ver. âCannot my tears incline? Will you provoke your ruine, perhaps mine? Art. I've done; and though death's business I despise, Yet when you talk that it may close your eyes, This too fond heart of mine, that did not fail At death in gross, shrinks now at the retail. Mut. Come, have ye done? I long till I remove With him thy hopes, if not destroy thy love. Ver. Hold, hold, your passion guides you to mistake; Alas, 'tis the wrong life that you wou'd take. Mut. My just revenge is this way best express'd, To take that life away which you love best. Ver. Yet hear me speak; Had I no life to pay To Nature, wou'd you then take his away? Mut. studies. How plain it is, if death to him you give, The reason only is because I live? Art. Do not on my loath'd life set such a rate; It is unkind to plead for what I hate. Mut. One thing may save all yet; If you will swear by all that you adore From hence, never to see each other more. Ver. What shall I do? I fear that this may be An easie Oath for him, though not for me. Art. âThen hear me swear. Ver. âAlas, I thought 'twou'd prove My fears wou'd be far truer then his love. Art. By all that's good, thus, in this blest amaze, I wou'd for ever on this object gaze. Mut. They trifle with my rage. Without there, ho. Enter one or two. Here Take 'um away. âHoldâbe gone with her, but let him stay. âNow Sir, Once more I ask you, will you swear? You'd best consult with wisdom, and with fear. Art. Let fear upon the prosp'rous hearts take hold, Cowards themselves in miseries grow bold. Mut. Fortune by me now offers to be kinde. Art. And raise me on the ruines of my minde; Though I am sunk, my honor keeps above. Mut. 'Tis not thy Honor urges, but thy love. Art. Those are the same. Poor frighted men at Sea, To save their lives cast all their goods away. In storms of Fortune, where there is a strife Which shall be sav'd man's honor, or his life, Who wou'd preserve this tottered Bark from fate, But sink the Vessel to preserve the freight? Mut. I'le shake thy stubborn spirit, while I feed Thy life with tortures, death shall death exceed. Art. Life may be less then life, as it does waste; But death cannot be more then death at last. Mut. Who's there? Enser one or two. âHereâ Take him away, and shut him up from light, Let him see nothing but death's image, Night. Art. Thou canst not reach the light that I shall find; A generous soul is Sun-shine to the minde. Mut. Be gone, In the least tittle he that disobeyes, His own neglect his wretched life betrayes. [Ex. with Art. Manet Mutius. In what encrease of Tempests I am tost, Like those in storms afraid of any Coast: Now every way to me unsafe appears, Reason has left the Helm, and Love now steers: Yet one trick more I am resolv'd to try; Loves wisdom is compos'd of treachery. âHoâCorbulo. Enter Corbulo. Cor. Your pleasure Sir? Mut. Fetch Verginia hither, And send Titus to spy abroad, And bring what news he can; however Let him not stay, for I intend at his return To look my self after Sulpitius. Cor. I will Sir. [Exit. Mut. This fellow fits my humor; Like flies he feeds upon the foulest things, And to the rugged'st places fastest clings. âButâI forget my business, I must now With all that's gentle smooth a rugged brow, And tempt her with feign'd goodness to believe; The shape of vertue still can best deceive. Those that in faithless Oceans take their way Sink in the Storms, but 'tis the Calms betray. Enter Corbulo with Verginia. She comes.âNow leave us Corbulo, But stay within my call.â [Exit Corbulo. Still drown'd in sorrow? sure my rage appears As just, and far more gentle then your tears; You fear the storms, yet make the tempests rise, While you retain foul weather in your eyes. Ver. Tempests by show'rs sometimes are laid to peace. Mut. And when you weep for me my storms will cease. Ver. To shew my gratitude I shew my fears, And poorly pay the debt of life with tears; Secure me only this, that he shall live, Or do not blame the sorrow that you give. Mut. Does not feign'd gratitude true passion hide? But since only by this it can be tri'd, Here in a sacred vow my self I tie, By me, nor by my means he shall not dye. Ver. Now you are gentle, And as in tears I paid to him his due, Now with dry'd eyes I'le pay my thanks to you. Mut. Your gratitude might finde a better way, And my kinde Vow with one as gentle pay: 'Tis the same Oath which he has took before, To avoid ever seeing of him more. Ver. If he has swore, alas, what need I swear? A Vow shou'd be as gentle as a Pray'r. Mut. Can Pray'rs to all alike so gentle be, Since all the worlds devotions disagree? None beg the same, the pray'rs of all the best Are little more then curses for the rest. Enter Corbulo. âHow nowâ Cor. Titus is return'd Sir, and sayes there is most noise By Numa's Grove; another joyn'd to him To scout on either side might bring you full intelligence. Mut. No, I will go my selfâIn the mean time Think gentlest maid how little I deny; Whoever you command must live or dye. [Ex. with Ver. âCorbuloâCome back.â I have a business that I dare commit Unto no care but thine.âGive out that I am gone, And with a shew of pitty offer Verginia To bring her to the stranger; in the mean time I'le place my self to over-hear their passions: The business will be easie. Corb. If 'twere hard it were all one to me. Mut. Dispatch then my brave Corbulo, And send Spurius along with Titus. [Ex. Corbulo. I will search out the secret of her heart, And finde that passion which she hides with Art: May be 'twas charity that fear'd his harm, But charity does seldom shew so warm. No, no, such deep concerns appear above, All taught affections, 'tis unlessen'd love: When this disease of jealousie can finde A way to seize upon a crazy minde; Most things instead of help or giving ease, The humor feeds and turns to the disease. [Exit. Enter Marcellina. âHarkâ I listen still for noise to be my guide, And want, yet have too much on every side. âO Sertorius!â How I pursue, with what uncertainty! Yet though I lose my way I follow thee: Hurried along upon loves wings I move, Pursuing Fate, and am pursu'd by love. [Exit. Enter Sulpitius with Hersilia and others. Sulp. Be pleased to pardon me Madam, I was enforced to lead you a by-way, Something about; we are nearer a place of safety now. Her. I wou'd not censure, but this seems to be A mingle between force and curtesie. Sulp. Since 'tis so hard to gain your clear belief, I must be innocent, though it gives you grief. Yet for your own sake do not wish to know, Time is too hasty, and my tongue too slow: Why shou'd his guilt and mischief blemish me? Yet silence seems a vertuous treachery. Her. Why do you shew such struglings in your breast? Sulp. Nature and friendship are at a contest; Know then, I wou'd you cou'd and I not tell, That Tiridates by Sertorius fell: You were the quarrel, and for you they strove With equal courage, and with equal love; Till fortune blinder now then ever prov'd, And deny'd victory to what you lov'd. Her. Ha, Tiridates dead! [weeps. Sulp. We have no time to talk, or to lament, Lest we meet dangers which we shou'd prevent. Her. Alas, my griefs the greatest dangers are: Who wou'd flye death that cannot flye despair? Sul. Sorrow deceives that bids you stay and die; 'Tis from Sertorius, not from death you flie; Whose rage had blown it self to such a height, It stopt not at th'unpappy Princes fate, But presently your Fathers Pallace blaz'd In circling flames which his revenge had rais'd, As if 'twere just he shou'd the ruine prove Of his own hopes, that had destroy'd your love. Her. Methinks my love looks mean in sorrow drest, Sure 'twou'd shew greater by revenge exprest. Sulp. Though nothing of your heart you will resign To me, let your revenge at least be mine. Her. O Tiridates! I have condemn'd my self to dye, and grieve; Revenge does only my short life reprieve. Enter Sertorius. Ha! the horrid monster comes; you pow'rs above, Revenge at once death and an injur'd love. Ser. Have I o're-took you villain with your prize? [draws. Sul. There's none is overtook but he that flies. Her. Defend me now Sulpitius. Sert. âHa, does Hersilia want such aid? O heavens, her Virtue's lost, or she's betray'd; I will not trifle out my cause with words. Her. Let my revenge and wrongs assist your Sword. Ser. What riddle's this? she courts his treachery, Then through their deaths I thus make haste to dye. [fights amongst 'um and kills one. Enter Marcellina, takes up his Sword, and hurts another that is running at Sertorius; he turns, and she and he fight, and Marcellina kills him, and then falls her self: in the mean time Sulpitius and the rest wound Sertorius so, that they fall together. Her. What, do I see? Marcellina! Mar. Hersilia! Sulp. Come, we must not stay, All is unsafe, and pity will betray. [Sulpitius pulls her. Sert. Here my last words, have so much Charity; My life was yours, but here 'tis just I dye; I feel new fires, my ancient flames appease, And I own health unto a new Disease. Her. Do'st thou not shrink at thy approaching fate? Are all my sorrows, and his blood no weight? Ser. What sorrows do you wear, or what's my crime? Sul. We trifle out our safety with the time. [pulls Hersilia Her. Stayâlet me tell him.â Sulp. â'Tis in vain, away. Sert. That Villain does betray you. Her. âHold, I will stay. O Marcellina! O Tiridates! Sert. âWhat is the mystery? Why do you call on them from whom you fly? Her. What does he say? Sulp. âHe raves, no matter what. Her. I'le hear him speak. Sul. âAway, it is too late.â [hurries her out, Exeunt. Manet Sertorius and Marcellina. Ser. What can this mean?âfarewel my unjust fires, New warmth grows in me, though my life expires. How slow I crawl? my love would make more haste. But weakned Nature cannot move so fast. My sinking Soul this bleeding Current drownds; How equal we are now in all our wounds? O speak and tell me if you can forgive; Or if that be too much, tell me you live. Mar. I wou'd deny you nothing; shou'd I say I live, Life while I tell it steals away. Be not concern'd; Death has the same event By Nature call'd, or brought by accident. Sert. Do not so willingly your life resign; Or if you must, let your Soul go with mine. Mar. It will go softly if it goes before, And wait for yours where they shall part no more. Sert. And shall we thus know one another there? Mar. Else we shou'd want a blessing we have here. Sert. I feel Deaths shades creep upon Natures light; O guide your hand to mine, 'tis almost night. Mar. Here, where is yours? Sert. âSearching to find yours out. Mar. Have it I now? weakness and love may doubt. Hold fast,âfarewel.âThere's somthingâhides. [dies. Sert. 'Tis death, that kindly thus it self divides. [dies. Exit Act IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. SCEN. I. Enter Artabaces. Art. Why to our Bodies are the Gods more kind, Then to the place where worship dwells, the Mind? Nature provides defence, and yields retreat From piercing cold, and from the scorching heat; But for the passions which about us wait There is no means allow'd proportionate. Enter Corbulo. Cor. Are you busie, Sir? [Mutius overbearing. Art. O wondrous busie. Cor. In what? Art. Why I was thinking that the World's ill ballanc'd, More Knaves than honest men. Cor. An honest man wou'd then be welcom sure. Art. Not to this place. Cor. To you, I hope. Art. Troth I have but little business for him. Cor. Do you not want a curtesie? Art. Yes, and one to do it. Cor. Pray try me, Sir. Art. With all my heart;âhelp me to a Sword. Cor. That's hard. Art. So are most curtesies; prethee do me an easie one. Cor. What's that? Art. Begon, and leave me. Cor. I wou'd first willingly do somthing for you, And wou'd help you to a Sword too; But they are too suspitious at this time, Strict spies are set on you; Somwhat more liberty is allow'd the Lady. Art. The Lady!âhaâdidst thou not say the Lady? Cor. Yes, I did.âIt takes. [Aside. Art. Cou'd you help me to speak with her, or see her, Though but for a look or two? Cor. Um'h. Art. That's too hard too. Cor. No, I will do't. Art. Are you sure of it? Cor. Stay there a little, and you shall see. [Steps to Mutius. Art. This fellow sure has inclinations to be honest. Cor. 'Tis done; watch there. [Comes back and exit. Mut. My best Corbulo. Art. I have been thinking. Why those above, so full of tenderness, Made ways so hard to good and happiness: Through graves we travel to felicity; The road unto Religion's misery. The ways might have been easier to find out, Not left so rugged, and so far about: To every object we submit our sense, And call our accidents their providence. There is no satisfaction here below, But such as Chance or strange extremes bestow: Secure Content can only be acquir'd By bruitish minds, or such which are inspir'd, Where Reason must not come, or can't encline, Sunk unto Beasts, or rais'd to be divine. Enter Corbulo with Verginia. Cor. Then, Sir, now believe. [Exit. Art. H'as don't indeed. Just so when welcom light begins to rise, An unknown Comfort steals on troubled eyes. Here let me kneel for ever in this place, And cling like Ivy to my first embrace. Ver. Alas, in sorrow shou'd we plant our Loves! Prisons are barren Soils where nothing proves. Joys may spring up and make a little shew; But fastning roots in prosperous places grow. Art. Love may, like Vertue starve in full content: Misfortunes are their noblest punishment. Ver. If Love fares well do not his Feasts betray, While Death stands ready to take all away: Let rather Art and Wisdom act their parts, And hide our Love from all things but our hearts. Art. Dull order takes from Love its edge and grace; He stumbles in all steps but his own pace; His sacred liberty is in fetters tied, When Art or Wisdom his loose steps wou'd guide. Ver. Perhaps there is a way to set you free. Art. Can I be so, and you want liberty? Ver. Do but at least comply with my design; For here your life's in danger more than mine. Art. Without your sight my life is less secure; Those wounds you gave your eyes can only cure; No Balm in absence will effectual prove, Nature provides no Weapon-salve for Love. Ver. Might you but live a Pris'ner still with me, It were unkind to wish your liberty; 'Tis offer'd from my love,âand yet I find [Sighs. You that deny to take it seem more kind. Enter Mutius hastily. Mut. 'Tis I must bring you freedom at the last. [Draws. Ver. O hold, remember what a Vow you past. Mut. It is thy falsness makes me call it back; No Vows so strong but just revenge will crack. Ver. Revenge will be no plea to those above. Mut. But they will hearken unto injur'd Love. Art. The gods will hear no business comes from thee. Mut. I'le send you on my errand. Ver. âOh through me Guid your kind Sword:âMethinks your looks appear [He pauses and studies. To me at least more gentle than they were. Mut. O yes, I am grown very tame, and now I think on't better I will keep my vow. Ver. The Gods reward what I can never pay. Mut. Hold, hold, take all together when you pray; For you shall see me take such wondrous care, That neither of you both shall need to swear. Ver. What do you mean? Mut. âWithout there, ho, Corbulo. Enter Corbulo. Art. O treacherous slave.â Mut. âYes, y'are in the right; Since you were squeamish to forswear her sight, I will secure your eyes without your vow. Ver. Oh Sir, by allâ Mut. âNay, no dissembling now: Take him away, and on his charming sight With burning Irons sear eternal night. Cor. How, burn out his eyes! Mut. âYes, burn out his eyes. Does Corbulo demur at Cruelties? No more, be gone Ver. âO hold, he bids you stay. Mut. He stays to meet his death that dares delay. Art. Farewel, fair Vestal; By my Souls eyes your Image shall be seen; And when 'tis dark without, I'le gaze within. Ver. O stay, I know you will relent, you must; Need you be cruel, when you shou'd be just? Preserve your Vow without your Cruelty; And do not make your Sin your Piety. [Exit with Artabaces. Mut. Begone. I'le practise what you taught before. I'le shew no pity, nor ask yours no more. Ver. But you may want pity from those above. Mut. Not now, since they deny'd it in your Love. Ver. They'l make me pay, if you will make me owe. Mut. You are too cunning, and the gods too slow. Enter Corbulo. How now, is't done? Cor. No. Mut. Ha!âthe reason, Slave? Cor. I think such horrid business was not in our bargain. Mut. Pitiful rascal, take that soft reward; [Strikes him. I'le trust such tender slaves no more. [Exit Mutius. Cor. Am I thus paid? Ver. Alas, what does he mean to do? Cor. Mischief, no doubt. Ver. Look on my wrongs, or your own injury; Revenge on him will prove pity to me. Cor. A blow! this my reward!âfollow me; I will do somthing, but I know not what. Uer. The Gods wou'd think that I enough had paid, Were my Tears measur'd, or my Sorrows weigh'd. [Exeunt. Enter Sulpitius with others, leading in Hersilia. Her. Hold, or you shall drag me on: There's somthing in all this like treachery; Sertorius now is dead, what need we fly? âLeave me;â You may be innocent if you obey. Sulp. No, we have wander'd, you may lose your way. Her. Take heed lest I suspect some ill design. Sulp. Suspicion will be more your fault than mine. Her. I fear that I have shar'd his guilt, I find Poor Marcellina's Ghost walks in my mind. Enter Tiridates. Ha!âTiridates!âfalse Villain. Sulp. Pish, 'tis his Ghost: Here lead her away To the appointed place; hold, you two, stay. Her. Help, Tiridates. [Exit with Hersilia. Tir. Villain, look back, and see thy death. Sulp. Death is more us'd to obey me than you. âDispatch him. [Fight, Tiridates falls. â'Tis done; come for Mutius House, away. [Exeunt. Tir. It will not be. [Strives to rise. I bleed so fast that wither'd life begins Te fade away for want of Natures Springs: And yet I feel no such decay of Love, Though life and passion from one fountain move. âHersilia,âHersilia.â [Swoons. Enter Artabaces with his Eyes out, and bound. Art. Where am I now? I thought the way to death had been so broad, Though I were blind I cou'd not miss the the road: Death's lodgings such perpetual darkness have, And I seem nothing but a walking Grave. âVerginia,âI must never hope to see; All Natures windows are shut up in me: The Sun too me brings an unuseful light; About me now I always carry night. There's yet one grief added to all my store, Never to see poor Tiridates more. Tir. Who's that names the unfortunate Tiridates? Art. What noise is this which sadly strikes my ear? A sound like Tiridates voice I hear. Tir. 'Tis yet his voice; were not my senses broke, I shou'd think too 'twere Artabaces spoke. Art. 'Tis Artabaces speaks, and seeks about For Tiridates. Tir. âWhy d'you not find me out? It is not dark. Art. âAlas, 'tis dark with me. Tir. Here, here; that I shou'd live once more to see My long-lost Brother! 'twill scarce shew like death In thy embraces to resign my breath. Art. O take me in thy arms for mine are tied; If they were free I have no eyes to guide. Tir. Assist me, my weak strength, but to unty Those arms, to make my self a place to die. [Unties him, and Artabaces sits down and takes him in his arms. Art. How dismally we meet like death and night! My arms are now thy strength, thy eyes my sight. Tir. What hand or chance shut up those eyes of thine? While I enquire the cause death closes mine. [dies. Art. He sinks; Tiridates,âBrother: His pulse is gone; 'Tis grown a dead low ebb with lifes warm flood: How proper are my tears? my eyes weep blood. He's gone before to rest, why must I stay? Eyes that are wounds might weep a life away: They drop too slow, life will not at this rate Distil away; I'le seek a quicker fate. [Starts up. Now I have hands, they will some death afford; I had forgot to ask him for his Sword; I'le grope it out;â'tis hard, I cannot find [He creeps up and down for't on's knees. The means of death; Fortune shou'd help the blind âOâI have it now. All steps of life were going to this home; But this does not bring death, but shew 'tis come. So motion causes what it can't express; 'Tis the last step declares the weariness. One thought for dear Verginia,âthenâ Enter Corbulo with Verginia. Cor. This way I'me sure.â âLook where he stands: I dare not stay. [Exit. Ver. Heaven reward yeâ Art. Who's there? Ver. âThe horrid deed is done! Look down on him you Pow'rs, with Pity too, That has no eyes left to look up to you. Art. Who's that which does too late the Gods implore? A musick like that voice I've heard before. Ver. That I were dumb. It is too much that I can speak and see; Each Sense is but a sev'ral misery. Art. It is Verginia; guide me where you stand, To leave my last kiss on your sacred hand. [She comes to him, and gives him her hand. Ver. O do not to despair your Soul resign; You eyes have been my guides, now see with mine. Art. 'Tis life, not you, that I forsake or fly; I do but go before you when I die. Ver. Hold, hold; Give me your Sword, 'tis fittest for me now; I dare not use it, and you know not how. Art. In this condition I can use it best; I need no eyes to guide it to my breast. Enter Mutius, and pauses a little. Ver. Hold, hold; Oh, Mutius comes! Stand behind me; Give me your useless Sword, for I can see. Art. Away, away; those Pow'rs will send supplys, And guide my Sword, that took away my eyes. Mut. Fair Cous'ner, have I overtook you now? With justice thus I break my slighted Vow. [Runs at Atabaces; he stands still, and catches the hilt of Mutius sword as it passes through his body, and kills him. Art. So, I heard him fall;âI think My Sword feels him now.â Is heânotâdead?â [Staggers and falls. Ver. Are you not dying too? O, let me know. Art. Yes, all the while I liv'd I have been so; Time equal steps to death and life does give; And those that fear to die, must fear to live: Death reconciles the Worlds and Natures strife, And is a part of order and of life. Uer. 'Tis out of order without Nature's call. Art. It were the same if accident paid all. We have no right in time to come, no more Than we had title to the time before. Uer. Yet to my life some pity shou'd be shown, (Uerginia's life) though you despise your own. Art. Reviving comfort from that Name is sent; And though myâfaintingâlifeâis almost spent, It baits upon your Name, and thenâgoes on; But 'tis so tir'd it cannotâtravelâlong. [Sinks. Uer. Oh! [Starts up a little. Art. I cou'd have smil'd at loss of life and Crowns But at the loss of you Iâdieâin frowns. [Dies Uer. Oh, do not leave me thus; for pity stay A little.â'Twas but just now he went away; I have not since had time to shed a tear; And yet the distance does the same appear As if h'ad been a thousand years from me. Time takes no measure in Eternity. [Weeps over him. Enter Hersilia with the Fellow that went off with her. Clau. This is th'unhappy place, and there the wretched object. âNow, your promis'd pardon. Her. Go, and live honest.â [Exit. Oh my Tiridates,âspeak but one word. [runs and kneels by him He's gone for ever;âhas he not left his Sword [She rises. To help me after?âHa!âwho's that appears [Sees Verginia. Like me in griefs, so drown'd in hopeless tears? Uer. âHa!âmy Sister Hersilia! She will prevent my death, Unless I quickly counterfeit some way To deceive her, and my own life betray. Her. 'Tis she;âAh, poor Uerginia!â Who's this who in his blood thus weltring lies, Mourn'd like a Lover by thy tender eyes? Uer. 'Twas one made me concern'd I know not how; But all is past, for he is nothing now; So we are told we must account the dead; And tears are wasted when for nothing shed. Her. Alas, you do but think that you have lov'd: Just so when Heaven, by some trouble mov'd, Unto some tender place its flames designs, It seems to burn, because the Lightning shines; But when 'tis gone, after its swift retreat, It's left, like you, without a flame or heat. Do but look on, and see me take my leave Of my dead Love, and you must learn to grieve. [She goes to kneel by her Love. Ver. 'Tis life that must to griefs their being give; And she that learns to grieve must learn to live. [goes to Artab. Come,âlend me your Sword, that I may find my heart, It keeps me now from you:âSure it will smart; [tries the point. âYetâall's but death,âby Nature,âSword, or Flame; But we find choice in that which is the same; And when the Gods our life seems to deny, 'Tis kind to let us chuse which way to die. âWhy d'ye hold your Sword so fast? let go: [Tries to get the Sword. This does not like your Love but Courage shew. I have been told, and do believe it true, Love out-lives death, which courage needs not do. âLet go. Her. StayâI had forgot to take my leave of her, [she rises. 'Tis just that nature shou'd some share receive, Since she in death for ever takes her leave. âHa,âpoor girle, what art thou doing there? [Sees Ver. by Artab.] Do not conceal thy Love, nor hide a tear. Ver. Nothing indeed, I only look'd to see Why the dead gave the living misery; I fancy'd Death some horror did express, It rather seems to promise quietness. Her. In sorrows death's securest payment lies, But youth like thine, untouch'd with miseries; As if it hop'd to scape and never pay, Puts off the Creditor from day to day. Ver. In grief the most ill husbandry's exprest, It makes us poor with paying interest; I've heard some Romans at a chearful Feast Invited Death to come and be a Guest: What wondrous act can you with sorrow do, Not to be equall'd with a chearful brow? Her. You may be one day touch'd with misery, Sorrow will teach you then to think of me: Farewel Verginia, these for thee I shed, All my last tears are due unto the dead. [she goes to Tirldates. Ver. O quickly now let go your Sword,âUnkinde, Why do you make me stay so long behinde? Indeed I shall not finde which way you went, Yet Arrows swiftest fly from Bowes most bent. âLet go,âthank yeâI cou'd afford to pay A thousand thanks; but that I cannot stay, [she gets the Sword. My Love's in haste, yet not one tear shall move, I will no more be childish in my love. âHersiliaâSister.â [She starts up. Her. âHaâ Ver. Pray see, you have good skill in grief you say, Does any look in all this face betray Sorrow within? can you the least descry? See how I smileâand nowâsee how I dye. [kills her self. Her. Thou hast indeed deceived me, thy brave fate I will not poorly praise, but imitate; In every thing, I'le fall as thou hast dy'd, And take my rest by my dead Lovers side. [kills her self. Enter Emilius with his followers, bringing in Sulpitius. Emil. Come Monster, shew me the place Of all thy mischiefs and my misery. Sulp. By all these signs of Death here it shou'd be. Emil. Ha,âHersilia dead, and poor Verginia! âWhere shall my griefs begin! Death like a Frost on a too early Spring Stole on thy blossoms.âMonster, come and see What heaps of ruine thou hast rais'd for me. Sulp. Ruines for you? trifles:âthere, gaze on mine; âThe loveâ Of forty thousand Fathers that can whine Their sorrows out, make but a formal shew, Short of a Lovers grief. Let me but go, And I will shew you why. Emil. Hold, keep him fast: What wou'dst thou do? Sulp. Since all the mischief's past, I might be trusted nowâI wou'd dye there Between them too: Those Lovers lie too near, I fancy they enjoy each other, For all they are as cold as cakes of Ice; That I might dye but once, or kill him twice. Emil. One wish be sure thou shalt obtain, for I Endure to live only to see thee dye. Sulp. We are at last agreed it seemsâComeâ Lend me a Sword then. Emil. Monster, thou shalt bleed By justice only. Sulp. O, I understand you, you mean Thrown down from the Tarpeian Rock; if you shou'd see My tumble, pray do not leap after me: Troth it may spoil your whining. Emil. Stop his vile breath, Till the infection is remov'd by death. Farewel Hersilia,âand farewel my sweet Verginia, I'le first revenge your deaths, and then I'le dye; So, though I take my lerve, my eyes are dry; Sorrow for such a loss too mean appears, Griefs were a Romans shame exprest in tears. The world shall weep for me when ever Fame Does but relate the Vestal-Virgins name. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just as the last Words were spoke Mr Lacy enter'd and spoke the EPILOGUE. By your leave Gentlemen.â After a sad and dismal Tragedy I do suppose that few expected me; But when I saw things grow so Tragical, I thought the Poet wou'd have kill'd us all; And craftily perhaps, so to prevent An Epilogue when all his Wit was spent: Besides, having been once a Poet, it does breed A foolish Itch to see how others speed. Troth we Poets have had ill success of late, But what you call our Faults, we call our Fate. I have rais'd a Scheme, and finde that Poets are Damn'd with the Influence of the Blazing-Star. Here has been Rhime good store, and very fit, For well made noise sometimes has past for Wit. â'Twou'd make you smile.â To see what confus'd faces Poets make, This walks about, and cryes 'twill never take: There's not one word of Mirth, nor Shew, nor Dance; A Man of Fars thought I may then advance; For I had promis'd, and I think you know it, A proper Crown for the next dullest Poet.

      <field name="fulltext">Thus it was Acted the Comical way; the Alteration beginning in ACT IV. towards the latter end, after these words, âAnd injur'd Loveâ Sulp. Come Madam, flythe sight of what you hate; If he pursue us stop him with his fate. Ser. She call'd me Monster, and implor'd their aid; Hersilia on her Virtue is betray'd. Slaves, let me pass. 1. âStop, or we'l make you stay. Sert. When 'tis deny'd I use to force my way. [They fight, he kills one; Marcellina enters and takes up his Sword and kills another; the rest fly. Sert. How like a helping Deity you prove! At once your pow'r has given Life and Love. Mar. What Love Sertorius? Sert. âThat which was due Once to Hersilia, is now so to you. Mar. Take heed; for though this passion seems to be A gratitude, 'tis still inconstancie. Sert. If Love admits a change, though it does grow From Virtue, will the change a Vice still shew? Mar. I fear it must; for Constancy's above All other Virtues that belong to Love. Sert. If virtue meerly dwells in Constancy, By that strange rule then all mankind shou'd be Firm to the error which they first embrac'd; For error is no more than Love ill plac'd. Mar. By this large rule, if ever you confess Your Love ill plac'd, 'tis just to love me less: If Love to those that most oblige is due, Fortune disposes of your Love, not you. Sert. In Loves adventures Fortune busie shews; But 'tis not she, but you, the Love bestows. What diff'rence in this Argument is shewn, To shake my Love, and to confirm your own! Mar. Mine is the same, and never can be less. Sert. Yours will enough secure my happiness. Come Fairest, let us thus pursue our Friends; Where you begin to help, misfortune ends. Thus as you are appear a Deity, Like an arm'd Pallas crown'd with Victory. [Exeunt. Exit ACT IV. In ACT V. the Alteration begins at these Words. Cor. Am I thus paid!âStay, Sir, If it must be done, I will not for a little squeamishness Lose my Rewards at last. Mut. O, I thought you wou'd repent. Ver. This is a strange Religion to be taught, To shew repentance but for one good thought. Mut. Well then, you are resolv'd? Cor. I'le do't, Sir, as unconcern'd As you are to command it. Mut. Take her away, and instantly about it. Uer. The Gods wou'd think that I enough had paid, Were my Tears measur'd, or my Sorrows weigh'd. [Exeunt. Enter a Veteran. Vet. Sir, Titus brings word, He saw Sulpitius with a Woman By Numas Grove; his haste shew'd some disorder. Mut. What luck is this, thus to be call'd away! I wou'd have made a little longer stay; But I'le haste back.âIt must not be delaid; For ought I know Sulpitius may want aid. No thought I have but comes clogg'd with a doubt: When ever busie man does but step out From his own usual track, he does confer More power on Fortune than belong'd to her. [Exit. The Scene opens, and Corbulo appears busie heating his Irons. Enter Mutius peeping. Mut. O, I am satisfi'd.âWhen thou hast done, My best Corbulo, turn him out alone, To wander up and down in his own night, And let him seek his way without his sight. [Exit. Cor. He was jealous sure. Now to my business. Within there, Titus; go fetch the Pris'ner, and then [Ent. Titus. Wait at the Gate that opens on the Tiber, And stir not till I call; 'tis Mutius Orders. Tit. âWell, we know it.

Art. âHadst thou said for death, T'had been more gentle: I'le not waste my breath To ask for pity; bless but my last sight, To let Verginia come and say, Good-night. Cor. Time's precious. Art.

Well, such a small Request I'le not deny. Art. Then I forgive thy former Treachery. [Exit Corbulo. I've copied fair Verginia's eyes within; Perhaps it wants a little finishing; My last looks in my heart will perfect all, And make the Copy serve th'Original. Enter Corbulo with Verginia; Corbulo goes to his Irons. Forgive me, Sacred Virgin, if my eyes Begg'd their last looks might be your Legacies. Ver. What do you mean! what is he doing there? What horrid instruments does he prepare? Art. Such as must rob me always of your sight, And without death bring a perpetual night. âO do not weep!â I seem to shrink under the load of fate, Not as 'tis mine, but as it proves your weight. Ver. My fears for you as kind and grateful are, Lest in your suff'rings I shou'd want a share: My grief seems great for want of miseries; I shou'd not weep if I might lose my eyes. Art. O do not grieve! see for your sake I'le prove Injurious to my self, more to my Love: To make your sorrow prove the less for me, Know that you love your Countries Enemy, Th'unfortunate Armenian Prince, that strove Against all Roman Conquests but your Love. Ver. 'Tis no concern to love whate're to me, Because y'ave been my Countries Enemy; Shou'd therefore my uninjur'd love decline? I fear it hardly wou'd had you been mine. Art. Yet think my Love's grown to a sad excess, When ts own greatness makes me wish yours less. Cor. Come, are you ready? Art. âYes, for miseries. Cor. Here are hot Looking-glasses for your eyes. Ver. Before your own let um true Mirrors stand. And shew how death stays blushing in your hand. Cor. My Irons cool. Ver. âWhat gentleness they shew! They from forc'd heats to cooler natures grow. Art. Fortune and Interest are disposers grown Of men, they have no natures of their own. Fair Vestal, let your sacred hand receive This kiss as pure as they; and when you finde My eyes are sunk in darkness, be so kinde As but to tell me if it can be true, That I have only lost my eyes, not you. Ver. My eyes shall still be yours, when you have none; But if you apprehend when yours are gone, Some other object may my heart encline, I'le beg him if you will to burn out mine. Cor. Come, I must stay no longer:âIf you dareâ Art. Yes, exquisite Villain, I can stare On death in any shape. Cor. âThen gaze on this; 'Twill make brave musick when you hear it hiss; [Puts his Irons in the water. What say you, does it sound unpleasantly? Ver. What does he mean? Cor. âI'le tell you instantly: Stay, I must fetch another Instrument. [Exit Corbulo. Art. His mischief varies only, not intent; Unless he means a gentle death to give, That with my life my torments may not live. Enter Corbulo with a Sword. Cor. See how you're both mistaken: Here, I bring you fate to give, and not to bear. Here, Sir, at once receive this Sword, and mine; Thus to your Fortunes all my own I joyn. Art. I have seen sudden starts to mischief grow; But turns to good are usually more slow. Cor. What, do you wonder at this change in me! Needs Courage arm'd admit such jealousie? Follow me quickly, while the Coast is clear; To stay or wonder wou'd be faults like fear. Art. Forgive me, Corbulo; And since thou dost resolve to share in mine, My gratitude will make my Fortunes thine. âO my Virginia,â My joys like men in crowds press out so fast, They stop by their own numbers and their haste. Ver. I fear diseases may this health pursue; For sudden Fortune has relapses too. Art. Banish these fears; against the Plagues of Fate, A Sword and Courage is a sure Receipt. [Exeunt. Enter Sulpitius with Claudius, bringing in Hersilia. Her. Stay, what d'you mean? or whither shou'd we fly? There's somthing in all this like treachery: Take heed lest I suspect some ill design. Sul. Suspition will be more your fau't than mine. Enter Tiridates. Her. Ha, Tiridates! O Villain! Tir. Look here, false man, and see thy death pursue. Sul. Death will as soon be sent from me as you. Hold her fast Claudius, that she now may see Whose due her Conquest proves by Victory. Tir. 'Tis brave thy Courage seems from Justice sent, To make thee stay and meet thy punishment. Sul. Is there a better or worse Cause in Love, Where all their Titles by their Passion prove? Loves Thrones by Conquest only are made good, Like Empire where there is no claim in Blood. Enter Mutius. Mut. How's this? Sulpitius, stay thy Sword, for thine, Must ne're engage without the help of mine. Sul. Stay Mutius, do not so injurious be, As to deprive my Love of Victory. Look on that Sun, whose power's not less great, Since she as well disposes life and heat. Rob me not of my hopes while she stands by; Love hovering seems to wait a Victory. Tir. Not all your Swords can so succesful prove; Though they may reach my life, they can't her love. Mut. Dispatch him Sir; I have much more to say; Though your love does, mine will not brook delay. Sulp. Thine Mutius! then Love has pow'r I see. Her. Sulpitius hold, or be my enemy, Beyond the pow'r of Mercy to forgive. Mut. Come, come, we trifle Sir, he must not live. âHa!â Enter Artabaces, with Verginia and Corbulo. Art. Whate're this foul play means, justice does guide, Where Mutius is, my Sword to t'other side. Sir, you seem to wantâWhat mist does rise! Or has not Corbulo put out my eyes, And I gaze on my Brother, as I use to do, Within my mind! Pray speak Sir, who are you? Tir. Your happy Brother, dear Artabaces, And still the same in all things but my joy; Fortune seems now grown weary to destroy. Mut. Ha! my Pris'ner by that treacherous Slave set free! Art. What do you stareâ Mut. âO, It seems you can see. Look there Sulpitius, nothing less divine Than that cou'd charm a heart so rough as mine. These are our Rivals too; just Fortune draws Our Swords together in an equal Cause. Art. Now know, fierce Mutius, though no cause can be So great as Love to make an Enemy; Yet to raise up thy horror to a height, Armenias Prince is sent to bring thy fate. Thou cruel man, that didst attempt to prove The ruine of my Country and my Love, Now thou shalt see whe're Conquest be thy due, And without numbers what thy Sword can do. Her. Sulpitius, hold; obey me yet at last, And I'le forgive all thy offences past. Sulp. While I am arm'd I scorn so mean to prove; You may forgive when I repent my love. Tir. We trifle time. Art. âCorbulo, that charge is thine. Cor. Kind Fate provides another Sword for mine. Art. Now, idle Fortune, modestly stand by, And let just Love dispose of Victory. They fight, Mutius falls, and Sulpitius stands staggering. Tir. Now Sulpitius, to whom's Hersilia due? Sul. Wou'd she were so to any one but you. Use your advantage to th'unfortunate; Honor is cruel that denies a fate. Must I fall thus, and in Hersilias sight? I stand to talk, that cannot go to fight. [Falls. Tir. Sulpitius live; As thou wert once my Friend, my Friend still prove. Sulp. That life thou giv'st is death unto my Love. Hersilia, now I beg your cruelty; I want no help to live, but some to die. Art. Brave man! I pity his ungentle fate; I wou'd have none that love unfortunate. âCome Tiridates,â How trembling after Victory we go, To pay Devotions which to Love we owe! Fortune at last seems kind in her designs, To bring our Victory before our Shrines. Tir. Ah Brother, I am still unfortunate, Not less by Honour now than once by Fate. Art. What's this! Tir. Fairest Hersilia, can you pity me, Not for your own but Honours cruelty? I must not speak of Love; yet though her ties Bind up my tongue, I thus may use my eyes. Art. Fair Vestal, Though Fortune now at last seems kind to me, Without you smile 'tis useless Victory. Ver. My joys must always wait on your success, Since they take being from your happiness. I beg now to return from whence I came; And there while I attend the Sacred Flame, My true concerns for you shall never cease, And pray for yours while I enjoy my peace. Art. Will you forsake me now, and be less kind, Than you once promis'd if I had been blind? I had been happier then by miseries: Now I lose you, that had but lost my eyes. Ver. Then you did need my help, now you are free: Does Love exceed the use of Charity? Art. Yet let not Charity your Love exceed; But grant me Almes as long as I have need. Ver. Alas, the World is full of storms I find; I wou'd return for shelter to my mind. Come, dear Hersilia, which way must we go? Ah me! why do you look upon me so? At once I weep and tremble too; my tears Spring without grief, and without cause my fears. Enter Sertorius and Marcellina. Sert. Look, Marcellina, see what Heaven bestows, As a full recompence of all your woes.â Mar. Hersillia and Verginia! Let me embrace you both, lest I shou'd wrong My love, which else wou'd stay from one too long. Her. Dear Marcellina, joy seems perfect now: Nor Love nor Fortune gives it without you. Tir. Sertorius!â I now demand my freedom from your Sword; In spight of torments I have kept my word, And silently endur'd my Miseries, Though all the while wrack'd by Hersilia's eyes. Sert. To such strict Honour all rewards are due; All I once hop'd I now resign to you. Here, fair Hersilia, may you as happy prove In his, as I in Marcellina's Love. Tir. How all my happiness together flows, If with Hersilia's Love your Friendship grows! Her. If I deny it wou'd ingrateful shew; I give not Love, but pay you what I owe. Sert. How, Mutius and Sulpitius too! Dead both together! Sul. âNo, wou'd it were true; Mutius you see has better luck than I, He's quiet, past the sense of misery. Sert. By whom fell Mutius? Art. âBy th'unfortunate; One that came here to fetch not bring a fate: While Tiridates liv'd and was not free, I blush'd at my own life and liberty; Hither I come either or both to pay, But lost my freedom by another way. 'Tis I, Armenias wretched Prince, whom yet Rome wants to make her Victory compleat: Let Tiridates live, and let me find But a swift death, and Rome's as great as kind. Tir. Sertorius, if your Friendship can extend To love Romes Enemy, because my Friend, No Conquest that you ever gain'd before Can exceed this, or will become you more. Sert. Dear Tiridates, were he not to you So lov'd a Brother, to his worth were due All that you ask; 'tis more than Victory Thus to embrace so brave an Enemy. Art. You Romans all the World sure must obey, Since you know how to Conquer every way. Tir. Permit me, fair Hersilia, to present Him whose dear loss I did so long lament. Ver. If for my sake you can more love bestow, My life and honour unto him I owe. Her. Either of these are ties enough to prove Strict Bonds, not Motives to oblige my love. Mar. My debts, Sir, and Hersilia's are the same. Art. You oblige one has nothing but a Name. My heart, though not o'recome by miseries, I lost a Conquest to Verginia's eyes. While I was mis'rable she did express Concerns like Love, but they are all grown less; For she will now forsake the World and me. Good Gods, give me again my misery. Dear Corbulo, repent, and make me blind; For when I'me wretched she'l again be kind. Ver. What have I done, that you shou'd tempt your Fate, And beg the Gods to be unfortunate? Art. Did you not say you wou'd forsake me now? Ver. To go to Heaven, do I fly from you? There by my pray'rs my love will best be try'd; You shall have more than all the world beside. Art. It is a strange devotion takes away The happiness for which it seems to pray. Enter Emilius and others. Ver. My Father! Emil. âHa, Hersilia and Verginia! Does not the fondness of my eyes betray! O let me thus confirm my happiness, Till my embraces grow to weariness: My joys encrease. Ha! Marcellina too! All Comforts next to them are brought by you. And since Sertorius finds his happiness In yours, to Tiridates I'le express My promis'd care, that he may happy prove, Like you, in mine and his Hersilia's love. Tir. Those blessings that you give are such a store, I almost blush that I must ask you more. See, Sir, my long-lost Brother, that here brought His life for mine, and his own ruine sought: Our Country gave the Roman Victories, Its King's now vanquish'd by a Romans eyes: Yet Sir, your pity will like Justice shew, To pay a love where she a life does owe. Ver. I owe him, Sir, my life, I do confess, And mean to pay him more than love, not less: I wou'd return and see the World no more, And there for him unwearied Heaven implore. Emil. No, dear Verginia, such a piety That robs me of thy sight, were guilt in thee. Nor need you fear, brave Prince, your own success; Our gratitude enjoyns your happiness. Art. Fair Vestal, since you must no more return To those, pity the flames that in me burn. You shall for ever have a Vestals Name, And like them always keep alive a flame. Ver. Since 'tis my Fathers pleasure that I stay, 'Tis you that make me willing to obey. Press me no more, till I by time may prove In yours as well instructed as my love. Art. That breath all my misfortunes blows away; The loss of Scepters Love can over-pay. Sert. Brave Sir, y'ave lost no Crown; for you shall find A Prince that loves the Conquest of the Mind; The great Augustus, whose bright Nature brings More surer Conquest than his Sword or Kings. Take up that wretched Man, that nothing may Hang heavy on the joys of this bright day: He's still my Brother, and may yet repent; A hopeless Love must be his punishment. How all our Joys are set in foils of Woes! As after Darkness Light the brighter shews, So from our Sorrows all our Joys encrease, And unto Love Rome owes a Friend and Peace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE Spoken by Mr Lacy, who is suppos'd to enter as intending to speak the Epilogue for the Tragedy. By your leave GentlemeâHow! what do I see! How! all alive! Then there's no use for me. 'Troth, I rejoyce you are reviv'd agen; And so farewel, good living Gentlemen. 1. Nay Mr Lacy. La. What wou'd you have with me? I can't speak Epilogues ex tempore: The Poet has done craftily to day; H'as spoild my Epilogue, perhaps his Play; H'as cur'd 'um all; a very pretty prank! And from a Poet turn'd a Mountebank. Well,âIf nothing pleases but Variety, I'le turn Rageu into a Tragedy. When Lacy, like a whining Lover, dies, Though you hate Tragedies 'twill wet your eyes. Letters of Marque are granted every where, And one Prize-Office is kept always here: All that are Phlegmatick are Enemies, Which makes Poets and Dutchmen certain Prize. All that I wish is that the Dutch may fight With as ill fortune as we Poets write. I thought to have spoke somthing of the Play; But you'l think what you please, what'ere I say. FINIS.</field>
